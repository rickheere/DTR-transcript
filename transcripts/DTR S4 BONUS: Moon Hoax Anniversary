00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:33 gentlemen happy moon hoax anniversary
00:41 today we're gonna talk about the issues
00:45 surrounding NASA which I think we've
00:50 talked about quite a bit might review a
00:53 little bit of just the evidence pool
00:55 that we tend to look at and the fact
00:58 that it's been so extensively documented
01:02 that nowadays I think we feel pretty
01:05 content that we've nailed enough smoking
01:09 guns that it's like alright check maybe
01:16 even checkmate but let's see what
01:18 happens here so this year 2019 they're
01:22 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
01:26 hoax of landing on the moon now they're
01:31 gonna tell you that they did and there's
01:34 gonna be people very angry that we don't
01:36 believe they're completely [ __ ]
01:38 made-up religion about the moon hoax
01:42 we're also going to talk about very
01:46 briefly to start this thing off with
01:49 Stanley Kubrick because some things have
01:55 changed since last year and definitely
01:57 changed since I guess season one or two
02:00 when I did the episode about Stan Lee
02:02 participating intentionally in the moon
02:08 hoax because I now know in terms of my
02:14 heart my soul but that's not the case if
02:19 he aided any aspect of the moon hoax
02:24 technology it was without his knowledge
02:26 and he would never do that because he's
02:31 not that kind of guy so last year in
02:35 2017 through a chain of events which
02:39 will just skip
02:40 because there's no value to it
02:41 whatsoever I made friends with Vivian
02:45 Kubrick his daughter and some of you
02:48 might remember Vivian from 2001 a Space
02:51 Odyssey Odyssey she was the little girl
02:54 that the actor talked to never my life
02:57 what I thought I would be speaking to
02:59 that girl on a regular basis she's now a
03:01 woman of course she also did one of the
03:04 most landmark soundtracks of any film
03:07 I've ever heard which is the score a
03:11 full metal jacket under a pseudonym but
03:14 a different name that blows my mind
03:18 because that soundtrack you know is in
03:22 line with the shining soundtrack work
03:25 that was done and I think goes all the
03:27 way back to the original Planet of the
03:28 Apes which was one of the most landmark
03:30 soundtracks to ever be put on a film so
03:33 she's an amazing person and I'm just
03:37 gonna make this fairly brief I'm gonna
03:38 make a brief for a strategic reason
03:39 which is her private business is her
03:41 private business
03:44 she has granted me permission to share
03:46 what I am sharing but Stanley Kubrick
03:51 who again I I thought the confession
03:54 video was fairly convincing for a number
03:59 of reasons one they said that this was a
04:01 particular actor with a particular name
04:02 and they never could produce that actor
04:06 they still haven't produced that actor I
04:08 did some photoshopping of the face and
04:12 there's some geometry that definitely is
04:14 very similar which is why they must have
04:17 picked this person the gentleman that
04:19 filmed it and said that he was a family
04:21 friend could have been a family friend
04:24 but he managed to escape the household
04:29 name in Vivian's memory so this guy for
04:34 being this big Chum managed to hide in
04:37 the shadows if he indeed had a
04:38 relationship at all with the Kubrick
04:40 family and he may have had a small
04:41 relationship have you had a big
04:42 relationship don't know but she pointed
04:46 out several visual aspects of her
04:49 father's genetic evolution and said if
04:52 this was filmed on the last
04:54 year of his life then this is what he
04:56 would have looked like and she pointed
04:58 me at various behind-the-scenes filming
05:01 a Full Metal Jacket of all things which
05:03 is in the 80s right I think it's
05:05 probably filmed between 85 and 87 and so
05:10 now I look back and I obviously feel a
05:13 little stupid with that one doesn't make
05:16 doesn't make the moon land he's any more
05:18 real but the more I learned about Stan
05:23 Lee and and what Vivian does for me is
05:26 point me in directions where I'm able to
05:28 do my own assessment instead of just
05:30 telling me my father was never this way
05:32 that she pointed out interviews and
05:35 things and in I did more research beyond
05:37 that and I'm on board
05:40 now the conspiracy to get a film started
05:43 that would essentially engineer the
05:48 techniques to do this is still very very
05:50 real it's just that Stan Lee was more
05:53 concerned with making a film then this
05:57 conspiracy he was home in England with
06:00 his family when this event occurred and
06:02 he was just as Gideon as excited as
06:05 anyone but there's a little catch Vivian
06:10 had a condition had a condition from I
06:13 think she said well obviously from birth
06:15 to about I think about nine years old or
06:20 so I wouldn't quote me on that but they
06:22 were you know like one of her last big
06:24 bouts with this is that she could stop
06:27 breathing at night when she was asleep
06:29 and so because of that Stan Lee kept her
06:34 close at all times she went to the set
06:37 with him a lot like for the majority of
06:40 her life when they used to film back in
06:44 the day his regiment was to come home to
06:46 the family and eat dinner
06:48 unlike the directors of today which will
06:49 sit on the set for 20 hours a day
06:52 giftware I was asleep that's not the way
06:56 Stan Lee made films based on the
06:58 conversations I've had with Vivian but
07:02 here's the beautiful silver lining to a
07:05 bad situation that she had
07:07 to endure as a child they were together
07:10 constantly she would go to the sets sets
07:15 with him even when she was too young to
07:16 understand exactly what was occurring
07:19 anytime he was missing she knew and
07:21 would you know raise a little Cain until
07:26 she was reunited with her father and
07:28 this would be minutes not hours or
07:30 something like that he once went on a
07:31 meeting one night and she woke up and
07:37 her dad wasn't there and there was a you
07:39 know she panicked a little bit because
07:40 she's like he's never done that before
07:41 so because of her condition and because
07:48 Stanley always took the entire family
07:50 every single place he went and he didn't
07:53 like planes so he would always take
07:55 boats so when they would anytime they go
07:57 from England to America and back she was
08:01 always there and they were always
08:02 literally side by side best buds this
08:06 went on until she was twelve and a half
08:08 well past the moon missions she's born
08:11 in 1960 so it's very easy to calculate
08:12 the the years right when she was given
08:18 permission to spend the night at a
08:19 friend's house if Stanley's off filming
08:23 all this other stuff one there be a
08:24 giant gap in her daily regimen of going
08:28 to the studio with her father because
08:30 this would take a long time wouldn't it
08:32 to figure out all these things I think
08:35 it was only on the set of Barry Lyndon
08:36 which is again we passed the moon
08:38 mission that he had to work solo for
08:42 various reasons I mean without the whole
08:45 family next to him that was it she was
08:48 on the art production team of the shiney
08:50 and I'm gonna share a little bit of the
08:53 shining with you and how things went
08:55 down so that we can dismiss the myths
08:56 because boy it is phenomenal how these
09:00 things happen and it does look like room
09:05 237 is part of a conspiracy to admit
09:08 that he was involved and he's trying to
09:11 point the finger but that's not the case
09:16 it's not the case and it's beautiful I
09:19 mean it with a gift too
09:21 is Vivian Kubrick the gift to us is that
09:24 she was at these locations paying
09:25 attention she's an extremely gifted
09:28 person in the mind to begin with I mean
09:30 just look at what she participated in I
09:33 mean the full-metal-jacket score alone
09:36 it's like to understand the
09:38 dimensionality of that soundtrack you
09:40 could teach courses in college on in my
09:42 opinion now you're gonna go back and
09:44 you're gonna view other episodes that I
09:46 did in the past and I'm not gonna take
09:48 him down but I'm going to be leaving
09:51 them out there so hopefully this episode
09:54 will clean things up a bit but she was
09:57 on the art production team of The
09:59 Shining
10:00 The Shining was filmed same general
10:03 location is a lot of his films in the UK
10:07 a lot of you big Kubrick buffs know
10:09 exactly what studios this would this
10:10 these were filmed in but the hotel was
10:12 actually built the interiors were built
10:14 inside England which I mean masterful
10:17 craftsmanship man it was ubiquitous with
10:20 the hotel that's actually an organ all
10:23 and the books supposed to be in Colorado
10:27 so what do we have here we have I think
10:30 the first thing that's really insinuated
10:32 I mean there's a bunch of there's a
10:35 bunch of like little nitpicky things the
10:37 the yellow Volkswagen which in the book
10:41 was read his was yellow and they think
10:43 that's an homage to Gus Grissom who said
10:46 this thing's gonna this thing's a lemon
10:48 and it's not going anywhere
10:49 but if you dive deep into the film one
10:51 of the other big ones was that the
10:53 Native American artwork on the wall
10:56 looks like Saturn five rockets it looks
10:58 like rocketry not Saturn five but your
11:01 rocketry I grew up in Kansas around
11:03 Native American art my entire life our
11:07 cities and towns and rivers and counties
11:10 are all named after you know every other
11:12 city is named after so so some Native
11:14 American tribe you know but the counties
11:18 are definitely I came from Neosho County
11:20 if Shawnee County in Sedgwick County and
11:25 a bunch of other really wild names so
11:26 anyway she said that she watched her
11:29 father picked that artwork out of
11:31 reference books and that he was
11:32 extremely busy so
11:34 they would set up the books on a table
11:36 he would come in he knew exactly what he
11:39 wanted and he would just literally go
11:41 through and either circle it or put it a
11:43 little note in there and say yeah this
11:44 is good this is good I'm good you know
11:46 it wasn't like a big stress ball of like
11:48 Oh make sure they look like roba I'm
11:50 Arab robots Rockets right so she has
11:54 very key memories of these moments and I
11:57 believe if I'm correct she hadn't seen
12:00 237 hadn't heard a lot of the conspiracy
12:02 theories about the shining so when her
12:04 and I had the conversation it was a very
12:06 candid new thing for her and she was
12:07 like oh that's that's not it I remember
12:10 that moment but the big giant scene is
12:14 the little boy playing with his toys on
12:16 the carpet and he's got little hot
12:20 wheels and the carpet is shaped like
12:21 hexagons we're gonna cover that the kid
12:24 stood up and had a Apollo 11 shirt on
12:27 which is the first mission which we're
12:29 about to celebrate the anniversary for
12:32 that looks suspect he's metaphorically
12:34 launching off of a pad looks pretty good
12:36 right then he goes down to room 237
12:40 it's two six its 217 in the book and
12:43 then they kept the conspiracy going why
12:46 did he make it to three seven and then
12:48 of course the key chain which is messed
12:51 with to basically signify moon room at
12:54 237 if you multiply times 100,000 is the
12:57 average miles at the time that we
12:59 thought the elliptical orbit around the
13:02 earth averages out to two hundred thirty
13:04 seven thousand miles now my physics
13:07 teacher in high school told me 225 which
13:11 is weird because he the joke was if you
13:14 drive your car 225 thousand miles which
13:17 maybe it's the closest distance to the
13:19 moon that you've gone to the moon with
13:22 your car if you drive another five
13:24 hundred thousand put five hundred
13:26 thousand on and you're you've driven
13:27 back mmm that's 450 I guess right but
13:31 that's kind of interesting so here's the
13:36 breakdown of how that went down
13:37 she was specifically assigned to get the
13:41 designs of the carpet to go to London
13:44 and her father said very specifically
13:45 finest find me the gaudiest carpet
13:48 you can find something really loud she
13:51 goes she picks out a bunch of samples
13:53 comes back he looks at all of them
13:55 doesn't like him but they got a deadline
13:57 they gotta keep rolling here they got to
13:59 make this carpet so she said that
14:01 another gentleman who was working on the
14:02 team so that's okay I'll just bang
14:05 something out real quick
14:06 he literally bang this thing out super
14:08 quick in the art room the art room is
14:11 like a bunch of tables they're all
14:13 surrounding they're all together
14:14 constantly talking to each other they
14:16 have all the equipment they need and
14:17 fabrication that was rushed over to Stan
14:21 Lee he looks at he's like looks great
14:23 naked that's where you get the hexagon
14:25 carpet from the knitted sweater with the
14:29 Apollo 11 on it boy isn't that just a
14:32 giveaway
14:33 well that was created by a woman an
14:36 Italian woman who was a friend of the
14:37 family who at one point Stanley said you
14:41 need to work for me during a dinner this
14:43 is way way before this moment and she's
14:45 like I don't know you know he's like
14:46 come on you were your designer you do
14:47 the stuff watch you work for me on the
14:49 set I'm always making my original stuff
14:51 my own stuff I need you to work for me
14:54 so this woman had worked on previous
14:56 efforts and she's sitting in there and
14:57 as it's the stories told she's with her
14:59 boyfriend and they were supposed to make
15:03 some unique sweater for the kid because
15:05 it immediately gets rid of all the
15:07 copyright problems and she's looking
15:10 around the room asking the question well
15:12 what do American boys wear because I
15:16 don't have any clue and I think as it
15:19 was told of the coupe the boyfriend said
15:22 well you know they just went to the moon
15:24 why don't you just do some type of
15:25 rocketry thing and so she knitted this
15:27 thing while talking to everyone got it
15:30 done and that was the sweater boom
15:32 finished amazing how if infected all of
15:37 our minds huh I was one of them 2:37
15:41 biggest conspiracy question in the world
15:44 about that movie why 237 well most of
15:49 you have heard the front front end story
15:52 which was the hotel called because they
15:55 asked permission to use the hotels you
15:57 know likeness in the movie and they said
16:01 okay
16:01 we've got a room 217 don't use that
16:04 because we don't anyone to be scared of
16:06 going to that room and so we changed it
16:10 end of story
16:12 so everyone's like well he changes it
16:14 specifically to be the moon miles right
16:16 all right well she told me she goes look
16:21 my father is a fluid amazing I'm maybe I
16:24 miss hurting amazing but he's a fluid
16:26 filmmaker he doesn't really sit and tear
16:30 up little things like this and so he
16:32 just changed it to 2 3 7 he says we'll
16:35 just make it 2 3 7 the hotel didn't call
16:38 and say please use this alternate number
16:40 which we don't have in our roster for
16:42 entire in terms of rooms and so it was
16:45 changed without any specificity which
16:48 has changed and that was it and later on
16:51 of course they ended up really having a
16:54 room 237 and it was like okay well the
16:56 movies a total landmark in movie history
16:59 so you know I guess we probably have
17:01 more people coming to the hotel just to
17:03 see it and stay in it because of this
17:05 movie I don't know if the interior looks
17:07 anything like the film I was sooo not
17:10 but maybe it does I don't know but the
17:13 the Cooper confession said that he met
17:17 with Nixon 11 months before the
17:21 anniversary which puts him in America in
17:24 the White House in I guess July so your
17:29 August September somewhere in September
17:32 October time frame he would have been
17:34 meeting with Nixon as the confession
17:36 video said he no one's really claimed
17:39 this confession video besides the guy he
17:41 said he filmed it all these people
17:44 saying you don't believe the D and I'm
17:45 like well help me out not believe in it
17:46 man you know it's funny
17:48 the Stanley was in England at the time
17:50 with his family because there was only
17:53 one trip over to promote 2001 a Space
17:59 Odyssey which was in the spring winter
18:03 spring early months of like the April
18:06 March April timeframe in 1968 which
18:10 would have been the year before same
18:13 year he was supposedly later on going
18:15 the white house sitting there having
18:16 this big meeting with Nixon it Ferb's
18:19 what Vivian believes about the MU
18:21 mission you'll have to get it out of her
18:25 communications to the world I am NOT
18:27 speaking on her behalf of what she
18:29 believes at all in that situation and
18:34 maybe at a future time her and I can get
18:36 together in episode and we can discuss
18:39 whatever she currently believes about
18:41 that whole thing so this is not getting
18:43 into any of that information whatsoever
18:46 and you need to know I'm giving you an
18:49 extremely paraphrased version of the
18:53 life that I worked out with her because
18:56 her and I went year to year to year and
18:59 she is actually interested in proving it
19:02 even further and not not because of
19:04 anything other than just it's just a you
19:08 know I mean she's a very strong person
19:10 you know whatever people are gonna think
19:12 whatever they think she understands that
19:14 yeah he's clear
19:17 he is clear participating this in any
19:20 conscious way now we know that NASA
19:22 employees actually worked on 2001 a
19:23 Space Odyssey they were designing the
19:26 suits especially the helmets the helmets
19:29 in that movie if you go watch the Tyler
19:31 cinema guy he he managed to find the
19:35 original videos of the NASA guys
19:37 briefing the press about the designs of
19:39 the helmet and their ingenious they have
19:43 little hard drives in him
19:45 it's ingenious so they were all over
19:48 this production 2001 a Space Odyssey
19:51 also mastered front projection I mean to
19:55 the extent that they still had those
19:57 retina the retina reflections and the
19:59 animals which the Stanley just said that
20:01 list looks cool just keep it in there
20:03 later that technique was used in Blade
20:06 Runner to signify replicant I don't
20:11 think it was necessarily front
20:12 projection but whatever reason it was in
20:14 the film right so we have a very
20:20 tumultuous situation in the United
20:22 States it's not horrendously bad we have
20:27 a lot of big corporations that
20:29 are engaging in some shenanigans trying
20:32 to keep some of us from communicating
20:35 with the world this particular channel
20:38 is definitely suffering from being
20:41 removed from organic search
20:43 luckily other search engines are so
20:47 DuckDuckGo tends to not have a problem
20:50 finding the related videos to anything
20:52 you look up
20:53 I think being for the most part is still
20:55 playing normal ball but the other big
20:59 big one that owns this channel and the
21:01 the other big media channel that we all
21:05 use they're not even how to get anymore
21:07 they're violating our First Amendment
21:09 and saying what are you gonna do about a
21:12 big guy and of course we're sitting here
21:14 going come on Q get the thing going here
21:18 we're coming up on this anniversary and
21:23 the big question is how hard did we
21:25 throw down during this phase when
21:27 there's going to be a big party about a
21:33 event that didn't occur in totality the
21:38 NASA organization of night of the 1960s
21:41 and early 70s is most likely completely
21:44 been overhauled four or five times
21:45 between then and now so do we need to do
21:50 we need to call the current employees
21:51 any names the answer is always no we
21:54 don't need to call anyone else names or
21:55 anyone names necessarily we want to go
21:59 to the moon most of us right when acid
22:02 just announced as I did the other video
22:03 that in 2024 they're going back to the
22:06 moon and isn't it weird that no one is
22:08 saying anything about that in the mass
22:11 media let me think about it
22:13 going back to the moon and their mission
22:15 statement is like we're there to stay
22:17 we're building Space Station space bases
22:20 and oh really Wow
22:24 sounds pretty amazing sounds like again
22:26 right before our very eyes and HD we're
22:30 going to see man strike a stone because
22:35 if you really look at the moon missions
22:36 and you liken it to starting fire for
22:38 the first time it's not quite as awesome
22:41 as fire to be honest because fire
22:43 led to us controlling fire led to us
22:45 being able to control the development of
22:47 societies like figuring out a seed works
22:50 in the ground or figuring how to build a
22:52 shelter or water well those are very
22:54 catalystic moments in human history but
22:59 getting to the moon if they had really
23:01 been there and continued to go back
23:03 working out the kinks in the platform
23:06 optimizing the platform figuring out
23:09 what's there what they could build with
23:11 the materials that are there how much
23:13 you stuff you gotta bring what are the
23:15 repercussions on the human body because
23:17 there is some gravity on the moon it
23:20 could have been the next fire but in
23:23 2024 which is only four years from now
23:27 and HESA says they're going back so
23:29 we're gonna see for the first time like
23:31 somebody struck this thing six times
23:35 let's just say every moon mission is one
23:37 fire and we haven't seen it since 1972
23:42 no one has put a man on the moon
23:44 an official story since 1972 and now
23:49 we're gonna go again and nobody cares
23:53 interesting it'll be interesting during
23:56 this hypee
23:58 anniversary that's about to occur and
24:00 I'm gonna try to put this out right on
24:01 the same day I don't know exactly what
24:03 day they're gonna choose they're gonna
24:04 choose the day stepped on the moon or
24:06 the day the saturn v launch and we'll
24:08 find out and I'll put the episode on
24:09 that day this whole endeavor of tracking
24:14 the hoax and proving it's a hoax
24:16 improving all the horrible mistakes that
24:19 they made and again hats off to them for
24:21 getting anyone to believe this at all
24:23 that's that's really truly amazing there
24:25 obviously were the top minds in the
24:27 world working together to create some
24:30 believable scenario I've said this
24:32 several times I say it more and more as
24:34 of late people were murdered Gus Grissom
24:39 was murdered and his two companions his
24:43 other fellow astronaut friends they were
24:44 murdered the the death report on Gus
24:47 Grissom was that he and the other two
24:48 gentlemen were poisoned via their oxygen
24:53 supply with cyanide which is why when
24:55 they burned up
24:56 inside the Apollo one they didn't try to
24:59 open it their bodies just were where
25:01 they were sitting it was just laying
25:02 there
25:03 nobody popped the emergency door which
25:07 has got you know TNT bolts on it that
25:09 blow that open it would have been out in
25:11 a couple seconds the other thing is they
25:15 are in protective suits and there isn't
25:17 infinite oxygen in this in this
25:20 compartment so you would burn it all up
25:21 and they might suffocate or something
25:23 there was maintenance on the inside of
25:25 the unit before the fire a little I've
25:31 heard it as a toggle switch that was
25:33 replaced so you flip it or it automates
25:35 and there's the spark or whatever it
25:36 need to have happened to cover the story
25:39 help maybe it's the toggle switch is the
25:41 first thing you do to get rid of a fire
25:43 you know and it's just like fire pop but
25:45 they're already dead is the problem so
25:49 there's there were some murders
25:50 above-ground murders right in front of
25:52 our face and my source on that is my
25:55 interview with bart sibrel who will
25:57 right there in the interview go look up
25:59 you know deep thoughts radio calm look
26:01 up ba RT his interview will come up
26:04 watch it it's only about 45 minutes long
26:06 he tells you right to your face he that
26:08 he is personal friends with Gus
26:10 Grissom's wife and son who's now
26:12 commercial pilot by the way and that the
26:14 report on the death of Gus Grissom is
26:17 about 9 inches thick and it says what I
26:23 just told you so if you don't believe
26:25 that that's the official report really
26:27 sorry guys
26:28 murdered we have picked this thing apart
26:31 at every conceivable level and I'm sure
26:34 that we have only scratched the core
26:36 surface of what could not take place
26:40 what's not happening is they're not
26:43 going to use the platform from 1969
26:45 they're using a new platform which is
26:47 the project Orion which was turned back
26:49 on having never reported a success by
26:52 the way that I am aware of it should
26:54 have been in big big bold letters in the
26:57 press project Orion puts human beings to
27:00 the Van Allen belts with no physical
27:01 repercussions they won't release the
27:05 unmanned mission data from Project Orion
27:08 which is an
27:09 and capsule going through the Van Allen
27:11 belts coming down getting all the
27:12 radiation readings and then figuring out
27:16 a way to get around it no they won't let
27:20 that data out bart sibrel went or sibrel
27:24 excuse i keep saying his name on the box
27:25 several he went to ness and said could
27:27 you please send me that data it's it
27:29 should be and shouldn't even have to
27:31 pass it should just be published nope
27:34 it's a matter of national security
27:36 why is it a matter of national security
27:38 when you know a dozen astronauts plus c
27:43 plus another half-dozen I was at 8:10
27:48 all the six missions that went in 13
27:51 which which went to the moon and came
27:53 back didn't get to didn't get to drop
27:55 down to the surface supposedly they all
27:56 went through it so she'll come up 0
27:59 should be absolutely confirmed that van
28:00 bells posed absolutely no human threat
28:03 but it does pose a massive threat normal
28:08 solar radiation poses a natural threat
28:12 Verner von Braun came out a long time
28:15 before he went to the mood and said the
28:17 way this is gonna work and Disney Walt
28:19 Disney Productions animated this I can't
28:23 cut it into this video if I do it'll get
28:24 a copyright strike but he animated what
28:29 Kubrick did in 2001 they built a wheel
28:31 in space they ferried fuel meaning
28:35 carrying it up there and then they built
28:38 a rocket up there which didn't have to
28:40 defeat Earth's gravity as much you know
28:43 from beyond the surface and then it
28:44 blasts straight to the moon lands comes
28:47 back to the wheel everybody you know
28:50 whatever takes his shower and then they
28:52 drop back down to the earth and a
28:54 different vehicle nope that's not the
28:58 way it happened
29:00 Saturn 5 magically does magic magic
29:03 magic with its inferior f1 boosters
29:07 remember Russia remember we were rushing
29:10 against time to beat the Russians to the
29:13 moon in 1973 that with a with a much
29:17 more powerful rocket did the math and
29:20 said we can't go to the moon
29:22 with what we have but that went in one
29:26 ear and out the other because the Cold
29:27 War was on and Rooskies are inferior
29:29 blah blah blah blah blah and everybody
29:32 said well of course they can't go
29:34 they're dumb Russians oh well there's a
29:37 little uh a little documentary on
29:39 Netflix and Russian you can watch so you
29:41 can it's you know it's translated at the
29:42 bottom we're in 1995 we went to this
29:46 Siberian warehouse where the boosters
29:48 that were made in 1973 were all stored
29:52 they were supposed to be destroyed but
29:54 the scientists said no way man these
29:56 things are awesome and the russians had
29:59 perfected again a turbo technique to
30:01 their motors meaning anytime you have
30:04 unspent fuel that goes through any type
30:06 of combustion system the best way the
30:10 best thing to do with it instead of just
30:11 throwing it out the bottom as unspent
30:14 fuel or fuel that will ignite in a way
30:17 that won't create any type of
30:18 compression thus and a lift no thrust is
30:20 to capture what doesn't burn and put it
30:23 back through the engine and nasa tried
30:26 NASA couldn't get it done but our ruski
30:29 friends did and so in 1995 NASA hears
30:34 about these boosters goes and grabs one
30:36 of them or two or three of them and said
30:38 you know the Russian government can I
30:39 can we buy these off you don't like
30:41 Serge you're sitting around doing
30:42 nothing and Russia's pretty broke at the
30:43 time because Yeltsin was selling the
30:45 joint out they did tests found out that
30:49 one booster was 2.5 times stronger than
30:52 the most modern booster NASA had
30:56 developed by 1995 now I'm not a huge
31:02 walking dictionary when it comes to NASA
31:03 engines but I'm going to assume that and
31:07 again the f1 boosters were not
31:09 redesigned or rebuilt from 1969 to 1972
31:12 so the design of that stayed the same
31:14 the platform locked in 1969 I'm assuming
31:19 that there were upgrades to these
31:21 boosters between 1972 and 1995 and the
31:25 Russian boosters were 2.5 times more
31:28 powerful it allowed us to miniaturize
31:30 all of our satellite launches because
31:32 you didn't need that many motors on the
31:34 bottom
31:36 mmm-hmm interesting if any of you've
31:40 seen the Russian rocket that they built
31:42 it it was formidable as hell man I mean
31:46 it it had this sort of triangular base
31:50 to it which was made a triangle so they
31:54 could fit more engines down below
31:57 now NASA Sol excuse was well we had a
31:59 very engine inferior engine so we put
32:02 more engines down below thus
32:03 counteracting the mathematics you know
32:07 there have been Caltech graduates in
32:11 their postgraduate degrees that have
32:16 used simulators to attack various
32:18 aspects of the moon landing but I
32:21 haven't heard anyone try to find out
32:24 what the f1 boosters were capable of to
32:27 then simulate whether or not it could
32:28 truly escape Earth's gravity achieve a
32:31 slingshot we're gonna talk about the
32:33 slingshot a little bit more here because
32:34 I picked on an air one small this is one
32:36 of the greatest hoaxes of the [ __ ]
32:38 planet right but the one that was was on
32:44 YouTube don't know if it's still there
32:45 was an engineer from Caltech a kid you
32:48 know and he built the capsule a little
32:52 bullet capsule and he created a
32:54 simulation of Earth's atmosphere this
32:57 thermodynamic simulator and he threw
33:01 that capsule at every conceivable angle
33:03 he could possibly throw it at at the
33:05 atmosphere with the shield out first at
33:07 the bottom of the bullet first and he
33:11 published the video of the simulation
33:13 and he goes this thing starts rolling
33:16 super fast as soon as it hits it rolls
33:18 there's no way to keep it stable
33:20 entering the atmosphere with this blast
33:23 shield underneath so he goes I'm not
33:25 telling you what happened and what
33:27 didn't happen with the moon hoax but he
33:28 goes with the most modern software in
33:31 the world that is used to calculate how
33:33 the 787 would fly you realize that thing
33:36 flew on the first day that's because the
33:39 simulation software is so accurate the
33:41 747 took 13 years - and like what was a
33:47 hundred and sixty some odd attempts to
33:49 fly the first
33:50 so that's how good this software is we
33:54 look guys it doesn't work it doesn't
33:57 work the astronauts would have been spun
33:59 to death absolutely turned inside out as
34:03 this thing starts spinning it what no
34:07 25,000 miles an hour or something huge
34:10 great
34:11 so the hoax goes on we're in a movement
34:15 now in this world where the Internet has
34:18 separated the world into a very small
34:21 group of non truthers and a much larger
34:24 group of truthers but because we are
34:28 trying to find information there is
34:30 another group that tries to disinfo the
34:33 crap out of everything and there's two
34:36 ways to whether I should say there's
34:38 several ways to dissing fun thing one is
34:42 to actually hide the information so you
34:46 can't get it which is why all this all
34:48 the tapes of the Apollo missions have
34:50 all been lost and there's a video of one
34:53 he's a nasty guy seen well you know what
34:54 it's all in this old media and we don't
34:56 even own the machines anymore that could
34:58 play it in it's like oh really oh really
35:00 the most important thing that man has
35:02 ever done since the wheel and fire and
35:04 you don't you didn't save it I mean I
35:06 got I got old jazz drives in my house
35:09 that read an old jazz tape because it
35:12 has like a bunch of music studio backup
35:14 stuff on it spare me that you don't have
35:16 what it takes to read this stuff so they
35:19 hide that's the first one second one is
35:22 that NASA comes up with these websites
35:24 that have all this debunking just
35:28 basically telling you to go into
35:29 complete cognitive dissidence it was
35:31 that way no matter what you prove
35:34 scientifically in simulation software or
35:36 pure logic you're wrong were right
35:40 therefore I don't know feel like you're
35:43 crazy
35:44 put your tin hat on right and then the
35:48 third and most popular technique is
35:50 repetition of the lie the most
35:53 fundamental form of indoctrination
35:55 brainwashing and tribalism to say either
36:00 you're with us or you're against us
36:02 and we're going to spend billions in
36:05 marketing to try and make that smaller
36:07 group of people who are interested in
36:09 the truth as big as possible hmm that's
36:13 not working anymore that's not working
36:16 anymore because these lies are so
36:19 evident once you see the proof that you
36:23 can't unsee it
36:24 and yes there are some optical illusions
36:28 out there where you're like oh man it's
36:29 a blue dress no it's a white dress with
36:31 black stripes in or you know it's
36:32 whatever a recent one went around where
36:36 it was a back of a car and it looked
36:37 like a beach with a with the sort of the
36:43 waves the Whitecaps kind of fizzling out
36:45 on the beach but it wasn't it was the
36:48 back of a car yeah I have optical
36:51 illusions like that but sitting around
36:54 watching the moon buggy drive around
36:56 without the human being who's in the
37:00 driver's seat move one inch beyond just
37:03 being jostled the the the dummy that's
37:06 in there it's unbelievable
37:09 no arm turns the steering wheel to
37:13 create the turn it's just happening by
37:15 itself like a remote control thing these
37:18 guys were complete jokesters all of the
37:20 astronauts had a fun time inside the
37:23 footage which is probably intelligence
37:25 officers or a pre-recorded studio set
37:29 and they're playing golf they're singing
37:33 you know just get through the tulips or
37:36 whatever I mean they're just goofing off
37:38 like crazy having fun which is in my
37:40 opinion up to a point and get your
37:42 mission done and get everything you're
37:43 supposed to be done but you should enjoy
37:44 yourself there should just be you know
37:47 15 minutes of oh my god I'm on the moon
37:49 decompression nope inside this buggy
37:54 nobody waves nobody does anything
37:56 interesting people have done the physics
38:00 on the rooster tail of dirt that pops
38:04 out of the back they going to compare it
38:07 to rooster tails that we do on earth and
38:09 it's exactly the same true geometry as
38:14 Earth instead of one-sixth graph
38:17 which is you know if you ever drive down
38:19 in a Midwest area or an old rural road
38:23 those of you in Australia you know this
38:25 hardcore if you live in the West you
38:27 drive and it is dry and you have a plume
38:30 of clouds up behind you that is you hope
38:34 you don't have to hit a stop sign
38:35 because your car will get out early
38:37 underneath this cloud one-sixth gravity
38:40 in a purely dry world of this it would
38:46 be like having a still water in a pond
38:49 and then jumping around and all of a
38:51 sudden and hopping out and looking at
38:52 the water it would be completely full of
38:55 these clouds nope
38:57 there's the weird little video of the
39:00 girl asking Buzz Aldrin you know why
39:02 haven't we gone back to the moon and
39:04 unless someone is deep faked this thing
39:06 to scrub the audio he flat-out tells the
39:10 girl we didn't we didn't go at all don't
39:17 know what that one I mean usually fakes
39:21 are outed you know like the original
39:24 footage gets released and or they do
39:27 like a really close microscopic view of
39:29 his mouth or close-up of his mouth and
39:32 he is saying something else and someone
39:35 puts the other audio cut and pasting it
39:37 from other phrases he might have said
39:39 that day no seems to hold the test of
39:42 time so far they're trying to play with
39:46 our minds and I had the you know the the
39:50 deep fake scam episode towards the end
39:54 of season 4 there it's a big deal they
39:58 don't want you to trust anything you
39:59 sing anymore I just saw new one which
40:02 was Jack Nicholson from The Shining was
40:06 replaced by Jim Carrey the face they're
40:11 trying to toy with your brain now the
40:14 funny thing is for all the young kids
40:15 that are very familiar with
40:16 computer-generated imagery you can tell
40:20 you can tell you need to look but if you
40:23 were casually viewing something you most
40:25 likely won't see the indicators
40:27 necessarily especially if you just look
40:29 at it for a split second
40:30 Kawai and you're hearing the voice go
40:32 and in you know your minds is hiring
40:34 your peripheral vision it still looks
40:36 like Obama talking but it's some deep
40:38 fake simulation this is going to ramp up
40:43 considerably from this point forward
40:46 until they have a crutch to stand on
40:50 okay let's rewind because I've made
40:52 several episodes about this sort of
40:54 thing but this is under the guise of a
40:56 moment that's about to occur as an
40:57 anniversary so NASA did something pretty
41:00 bad back in the day found it by a bunch
41:03 of ex Nazis go figure well what is the
41:09 deal today we have an organization with
41:14 all of its subsidiaries that help them
41:16 and we don't want them to be stealing
41:23 money that should be going towards a lot
41:26 of other efforts that we have that need
41:28 the money we have a crisis in education
41:31 while we need to redo the entire
41:33 curriculum of kids education that money
41:36 could be used for that we have student
41:38 loans that are absolutely out of control
41:40 we should think about that I mean you
41:42 realize the United States government
41:43 could pay off all the student loans that
41:45 are out there in a day just sign a piece
41:47 of paper
41:48 yeah it'll eventually get paid off by
41:51 taxes but let's just reset all the kids
41:53 but then let's fix the system by which
41:55 college degrees cost an exorbitant
41:57 amount of money for crappy degrees that
41:59 don't leal jobs so this is sort of some
42:02 of the bases of the formula of why we
42:05 don't want these lies to continue it is
42:08 sucking us dry but now let's think about
42:11 him if you had a gun to your head and
42:16 the god machine in front of us that will
42:19 tell us the truth about anything tell us
42:21 positive or negative
42:22 whatever we're asking it the true/false
42:24 answer would you bet against the fact
42:26 that NASA and JPL and all their
42:28 subsidiaries are not creating valuable
42:31 ardi with that money nothing no patents
42:34 no inventions that will help us later on
42:37 in life I think most of us would not
42:40 take that bet against
42:43 fact so they are creating amazing
42:47 inventions and you know again I've said
42:49 this several times the people who work
42:50 for these organizations are beyond
42:52 brilliant
42:54 the trouble with academia is that you
42:58 could have a very strong left brain you
43:02 might even have quite a bit of your
43:03 right brain but if you've been rewarded
43:06 every single time you bought propaganda
43:10 when does it stop I suggest never it
43:16 never stops
43:18 becoming a doctor in this in this world
43:21 is pretty interesting isn't it doesn't
43:22 matter where you are in the world you're
43:26 taught some true things about the body
43:27 and then you're taught some dogma they
43:29 have something called Dogma theory in
43:30 medical science it's interesting and so
43:35 doctors are only able to go up to a
43:36 certain point of generating revenue for
43:39 the hospital that they work out or the
43:41 practice that they start they like it
43:43 because it's a great way of life
43:45 hopefully hopefully enjoy what they do
43:48 but we know the referral nightmares at
43:51 least in the United States a big giant
43:54 portion of clinic revenue is simply
44:02 referring patients from one doctor to
44:04 the other in fact you could be helped a
44:08 plastic surgery company when I first
44:10 came here closer a plastic surgery
44:12 clinic when I first got here they just
44:15 needed a website I helped him out and it
44:18 was just a clinic where doctors would
44:20 who are plastic surgeons would come in
44:22 and perform all kinds of augmentations
44:24 and they might they might only visit
44:26 that clinic one time in their entire
44:27 lifetime but if there was any
44:29 pre-existing condition that needed to be
44:31 dealt with that he made money with the
44:33 referral because like this isn't my area
44:34 of expertise you have eyes no throat
44:36 problem refer you over and they simply
44:39 treat human beings like stock chips and
44:43 you get referred to the doctor that's
44:46 going to pay the most for the patient
44:47 and then my friends who work there who
44:50 refer me to that company later on told
44:53 me you know you never get the best
44:55 doctor
44:56 because the best doctors don't have to
44:57 pay a tremendous amount of money because
44:59 they have either walk-in clients or a
45:01 hospital they work for that will give it
45:04 to them at a lower price you pay more to
45:07 establish yourself in the industry you
45:09 know maybe you get a fantastic doctor
45:11 but they said that some of the quacks of
45:14 the world pay a tremendous amount of
45:15 money that's the only way they can get
45:17 it referral and so you don't get the
45:19 best doctor now do we need to give NASA
45:22 a giant black eye in the middle of this
45:25 Great Awakening yeah probably not
45:29 you know I think we need to sort of let
45:33 this naturally take effect I'll say this
45:40 very figuratively very symbolically we
45:43 have at least one ex-president who is
45:47 probably involved with some very serious
45:49 crimes related to an island of which the
45:57 owner is now incarcerated about to start
46:01 his trial and think thank god he pled
46:04 not guilty because now discovery starts
46:07 you plead guilty you just get your
46:09 sentence and you go away it's done but
46:11 once you go to trial because you say not
46:13 guilty discovery starts happening in
46:15 Oldboy
46:16 this is going to be a firework show but
46:19 now what if in the course of that case
46:22 this former president let's listen let's
46:28 button this dude up here there is a feed
46:34 this into your brain there's a book
46:36 written by Douglas Adams the show's
46:38 called deep thoughts radio right and he
46:40 had a deep thoughts computer then when
46:42 asked the answer to life the universe
46:44 and everything he thought for like 11
46:46 million years 7 million or something
46:47 like that
46:47 and the number was 42 was the answer and
46:52 then that catalyzes the rest of the
46:55 story which is very funny
46:56 so think about his answer and former
47:01 precedents I think you'll know who I'm
47:02 talking about what if we got enough
47:06 evidence to prove that this gentleman
47:08 was one of the most
47:10 egregious customers of this enterprise
47:15 all right how will we take care of that
47:19 I mean we don't wanna lose face to the
47:20 rest of the world right but justice has
47:22 to be served otherwise is all the
47:24 suffering from the victims goes
47:28 unpunished and the justice system fails
47:31 these individuals it's sort of like the
47:35 situation that we have with NASA does a
47:39 kid with the PhD who's 27 years old
47:41 male/female doesn't matter from around
47:44 the world doesn't matter is it their
47:46 fault this thing's happening or that it
47:48 happened in the past or that current
47:49 projects or is just as nefarious as the
47:52 ones we're talking about here of course
47:54 not wouldn't that be the majority of the
47:57 employees probably some people from an
48:03 economic standpoint might simply say
48:05 look man what do you care about this
48:08 crap we're pumping let's just say 10
48:12 million a day and to various
48:15 organizations that are related to this
48:16 essential NASA thing NASA takes around
48:18 six I'm going to understand that goes
48:21 into the economy it pays people salaries
48:24 what do you care do you think they're
48:27 killing people today as a result of what
48:31 they're doing I don't know I would say
48:35 probably not we have other space
48:38 organizations like SpaceX which put out
48:40 phony videos of Tesla roadsters floating
48:44 in space with all kinds of flaws in the
48:46 footage a car that would absolutely
48:49 either boil away or blow up if the
48:52 second it was you know released into the
48:56 upper atmosphere of which they said they
48:59 put it right in the Sun parts of the car
49:02 would be 280 degrees Fahrenheit in the
49:05 shadows it'd be negative to 280 but you
49:08 can bring it down to 250 and it still
49:10 has a problem the tires would have to
49:12 have been solid rubber otherwise if they
49:16 were remotely inflated which these were
49:18 they would have exploded what would have
49:21 what outside pressure would have held
49:23 the tire together
49:24 nothing if you took everything in your
49:26 house everything you know if you're in a
49:28 car listen to this in podcast if you're
49:30 in your home watching this think about
49:32 chilling half the room down it will
49:35 affect this thing rotates let's just do
49:37 it this way you take everything in your
49:38 room heat it up to 250 and then within a
49:42 split second slam it down to 250 below
49:44 and I mean the split second
49:46 instantaneous because it just rotates in
49:48 the shadow how many of the items in your
49:52 house would not explode in that process
49:56 well whatever the building Tesla cars
49:58 add up we should build the whole world
49:59 out of because then nothing can hurt
50:01 them people asked me every once in a
50:04 while on the side channels what I think
50:07 about Elon Musk is a human being being
50:09 involved with this kind of stuff and I
50:13 would say I don't think he has a choice
50:16 anymore
50:16 I'm not sure he ever had a choice I
50:19 think he was doing some pretty benign
50:20 things making internet startups working
50:24 on a car it's all pretty straightforward
50:27 production but once SpaceX was offered
50:32 as a way to counterbalance a negative
50:38 margin in every company he's ever
50:41 started right
50:41 Tesla's never made a profit his battery
50:45 companies haven't even started selling
50:47 batteries to the world as far as I
50:48 understand but they're massively in the
50:50 red as well and they're like look SpaceX
50:52 is going to be a complete black book of
50:54 good solid inc of income you're are you
50:59 in it's the thing we're gonna throw you
51:00 we're really launching rockets they're
51:02 gonna go up but we're gonna put a bunch
51:04 of shenanigans in there too these
51:06 boosters are gonna come back down and
51:07 land but no one's gonna be allowed to
51:09 ever see it live don't know we'd only
51:12 prove we don't have mark Dice out there
51:15 with his phone filming it I would trust
51:17 that guy certainly would trust myself it
51:22 would be great it'd be great to see it
51:23 happen you know quarter mile from where
51:26 I'm standing
51:27 half a mile whatever but there's no
51:29 obstruction between me and it and I
51:31 would take my glasses off and use
51:32 binoculars make sure it's all there yeah
51:34 sure great and then we're done that once
51:37 one mystery
51:37 one conspiracy extinguished great but
51:41 then an offer and are they their
51:43 launches look like ridiculous
51:45 made for TV shows and you know Saturday
51:49 afternoon matinees where little kids are
51:51 yelling and screaming okay I'm glad you
51:53 know like they care whether or not
51:55 separation works and they're screaming
51:57 and yelling just utter fakeness I mean I
52:00 I almost get sick to my stomach watching
52:02 those guys yell and scream because I'm
52:03 thinking this is all fake man
52:05 and the kids in the studios don't have
52:08 any clue no one's gonna buy wise is
52:10 offering the applaud sign comes on you
52:15 know applaud you know it's just
52:18 indoctrination and now those individuals
52:21 will go out and for the rest of their
52:22 life and think I was a part of something
52:24 special and you go by the way that never
52:26 those things that you know not all of
52:28 the things but a lot of things that
52:30 you're yelling and screaming about we're
52:32 fake I'll [ __ ] you man
52:34 right it's part of that third strategy
52:37 of creating a bigger pool of morons I'm
52:42 not saying those people applause I'm
52:43 just saying that you teach them things
52:45 that aren't true but again let's talk
52:48 about the slingshot theory a little bit
52:50 with Saturn 5 especially because I've
52:52 covered this once before but I've
52:55 further found ways of convincing you
52:58 that this is fake we have recently in
53:04 the last five years NASA has claimed to
53:06 put orbital reconnaissance satellites
53:10 around Jupiter
53:12 now again part of that is probably just
53:16 on its face value complete BS finding a
53:18 stellar body from a rocket that launched
53:21 from Earth you know what is it using as
53:23 a guidance system yeah there's a bunch
53:25 of mathematics but you have a problem
53:26 that Jupiter's hauling mega ass in the
53:28 solar system and you absolutely have to
53:33 catch up with it and if it's coming at
53:36 you at a super fast speed getting in an
53:40 accurate orbit around it is is just like
53:43 oh my god it's like it's like throwing a
53:49 piece of thread across
53:51 a backyard and it threads itself in a
53:53 needle it's also being thrown at you the
53:55 other way you know it's like it's an
53:57 absurd level of accuracy that I do not
54:00 believe under any circumstance we have
54:02 and I'll tell you why those Patriot
54:05 rockets that we were building in the
54:07 ballistic missile shields that we've
54:08 been building failed for so many decades
54:10 right where they have a missile coming
54:12 in and they have another missile that
54:13 comes up and hits it it's pretty
54:16 accurate nowadays but it still has a
54:17 bunch of flaws which is why they do it
54:19 in three tiers now you know this one is
54:21 like two or three different levels of
54:23 rockets we'll keep firing out the thing
54:25 to knock out this guy well according to
54:26 NASA there's no need for that what do
54:29 you think's harder catch enough with
54:31 Mars catching up with Jupiter and Saturn
54:34 and all these other planets but they're
54:37 so far away they're little dots in the
54:40 sky hundreds of millions of miles away
54:44 okay and we can barely hit a missile out
54:49 of the sky so that's one thing that's
54:50 just right there in your face come on
54:52 was it military's not getting the data
54:54 out of NASA come on if anything military
54:57 covert black ops skunk works stuff is
55:00 being given to NASA if any if there's
55:02 any pipeline in one direction
55:04 it's that direction and the military can
55:06 barely create these things but go back
55:09 to the one I forgot its name I should
55:10 look it up but the reconnaissance
55:12 satellite that went around Jupiter when
55:15 NASA released their CG of how it was
55:18 orbiting Jupiter they did a slingshot a
55:22 descending orbit so on one side it's
55:25 very very close to the to the planet and
55:28 then it goes way way way out and then
55:31 over time that diminishes the loops gets
55:34 closer and closer and closer and it's
55:35 taking pictures every time it gets close
55:36 and then it eventually plummets into the
55:39 atmosphere of Jupiter and it's gone good
55:43 at least that illustration makes sense
55:46 with the slingshot theory but how many
55:50 of you remember especially in the 60s
55:52 you old-timers who still think we win if
55:54 you're still there when they did the
55:57 slingshot Theory illustrations way back
55:59 in the 60s with very proficient amazing
56:03 artists and animators this Saturn 5 is
56:07 always Allah started going around the
56:08 earth and then they just say it
56:09 magically slingshots towards them
56:11 towards the moon that's how it's able to
56:13 escape the Earth's gravitational force
56:16 something von Braun said was not
56:19 possible with the size of the rocket
56:21 which is the Saturn 5 hence his firing
56:23 in 1974 I mean this guy is like the
56:27 reason why we had fire if you think of
56:29 the moon missions as fire he's the
56:33 reason and he's like that won't work but
56:36 of course it works so in order to create
56:39 a slingshot from our home planet you're
56:42 gonna have to launch and then you're
56:44 going to have to gradually increase your
56:46 elliptical orbit in the opposite
56:47 direction around us we have to somehow
56:50 fire some sort of propulsion system
56:53 that's going to increase into an
56:57 elliptical orbit such that when it comes
57:01 back to earth is going faster and faster
57:03 and faster and then you're going to have
57:05 to break away from crashing into Earth
57:09 remember elliptical orbits always tend
57:11 to get thinner and thinner and fitter
57:12 remember you hold a rubber band out it's
57:16 you can make it you couldn't hold a
57:17 rubber band in a way that you wrap it
57:19 around told the paper ring a little
57:22 cardboard thing in the center and it's
57:23 perfectly round and then if you want to
57:25 grab it and pull it into an elliptical
57:27 orbit shape it gets thinner in the
57:30 middle the orbital center gets thinner
57:32 the radius of this ellipses gets thinner
57:35 so in order to compensate for you know
57:39 the elliptical orbit getting closer and
57:41 closer which makes it slam into the
57:42 surface of the earth any a lot of power
57:45 all this stage rocket stuff that we do
57:49 well by the time you think it's in orbit
57:51 especially all the SpaceX Falcon 9 stuff
57:54 we got a little tiny engine on the back
57:56 oh yeah it blows the big famous shot
57:58 where it's glowing hot whatever it's
58:02 gonna need a lot more power and I you
58:04 know we're not fighting the Earth's
58:05 atmosphere so it's not gonna be quite a
58:07 full Saturn 5 in space you don't need a
58:09 first stage up there but you're gonna
58:12 need a lot more than what they're
58:13 telling you and this
58:16 Thayne this Apollo capsule that goes to
58:20 the moon it's not remotely equipped with
58:23 that sort of thrust it's done and that's
58:26 one reason why this thing stinks to high
58:30 heaven and all the other missions to
58:31 other planets stinks to high heaven
58:34 someone recently told me I can't
58:35 remember it was was saying to me that oh
58:40 I know it was yeah a very good friend of
58:42 mine he was telling me that he was
58:46 reading some book and and and watched
58:48 some conspiracy videos on it and he's a
58:50 very brilliant person and he he's very
58:53 into the UFO alien thing he completely
58:56 believes that they're here and that sort
58:58 of thing so and just to kind of preface
59:00 that for you but he had read this book
59:03 about this giant war that happened on
59:05 the surface of Mars and the reason why
59:07 it's all iron dust now with no life on
59:10 it and again who knows what the hell we
59:12 know about that place but NASA has given
59:17 us a full surface rendering of Mars you
59:21 can do Google Mars and you sit there and
59:23 run around on Mars
59:24 it's interesting but there's this big
59:25 gash down the center of the equator line
59:28 or close to and he said that gash is a
59:34 part of the big war that happened
59:36 because it makes no geological sense as
59:39 to how it exists I started thinking
59:42 about that I was thinking well you know
59:43 I believe in expanding earth perhaps the
59:46 gash is a part of extent is expanding
59:49 earth but the more I looked at the
59:50 simulators which again probably a
59:52 thousand percent fake it goes down
59:55 really quick like the Grand Canyon it's
59:57 way way bigger than the Grand Canyon
59:59 undred Grand Canyon's and much deeper
60:01 than the Grand Canyon and so expanding
60:04 Mars
60:07 you know it should expand slowly over
60:09 time and fill in the gaps like we have
60:11 here on earth and then he proceeded to
60:14 tell me Grand Canyon was formed by a
60:18 rushing river
60:20 now River runs through the Grand Canyon
60:23 for sure whether it suddenly ran so
60:27 intensely monsoon ish that it could gash
60:30 a big giant crater out of the ground
60:32 which is the Grand Canyon doesn't make
60:34 any sense to me
60:35 I think that's expanding earth it tore
60:39 and then water got in there so
60:42 everything's working together to create
60:43 this big gash one of our listeners
60:46 reported in this morning he said that
60:50 you know with the with the most
60:52 aggressive telescopes that we have on
60:55 earth including this telescope arrays he
60:58 said that the closest that we can see
61:00 things on the moon is 90 meters I guess
61:05 per pixel without putting a
61:07 reconnaissance vehicle up there to take
61:09 better pictures know the pictures of the
61:12 lunar landers are completely wrong but
61:16 they'll show you those pictures to say
61:18 city man that's proof we wanted moon
61:19 it's like no it's not buddy because that
61:21 that lunar module kickstand it's still
61:24 there that LEM kickstand is four times
61:28 as big as the real one sorry buddy so
61:32 all those little trails from the buggy
61:35 that's up there there all four times too
61:37 big
61:37 big problem everything falls apart and
61:43 what's funny now is I think we've
61:46 reached a sweet spot where nobody cares
61:47 anymore about trying to find more
61:49 evidence when you get in a conversation
61:51 where someone is going oh we didn't go
61:54 and they're interested in knowing it's
61:57 not as exciting as it used to be to take
61:59 everyone through everything one to get
62:03 overwhelmed really quickly because it's
62:05 just so much and they're not able to you
62:08 know I usually try to use pictures and
62:10 so I'm like okay look at this look at
62:11 this look at the blue marble shot look
62:12 at the Red Sea on the first Saturn 5 or
62:15 Saturn 5 the first Apollo 17 picture of
62:20 the Earth from
62:21 space the the Red Sea's completely
62:23 screwed up because it's a composite
62:25 because it's not real again they said
62:27 it's a snapshot it should be should be
62:31 you're you're far away from a ball you
62:33 take a picture of a ball it's all in one
62:35 shot
62:35 big deal nope it's a composite of a
62:38 bunch of high-altitude airplanes jets
62:41 whatever and someone did a brilliant job
62:44 stitching the thing together but then
62:47 you launch Google Earth and you rotate
62:49 into the same position as the Blue
62:50 Marble and you have the continents are
62:56 completely the wrong shape they're
62:59 distorted they're wrong now whether or
63:01 not you take the Peter projection map
63:02 which is the true proportions of all the
63:05 continents on earth all the globe's on
63:07 the earth are wrong unless they have
63:08 Peter projection accuracy on them then
63:13 it's going to be wrong so is that proof
63:17 well what's funny about it is I think
63:19 that the blue marble has the opposite
63:23 distortion what should be happening is
63:25 that since Google Earth matches the
63:29 globe's Madagascar which is off to the
63:32 right of Africa which is what this shot
63:34 has is too far up on the if I remember
63:37 it right it's too far up on the Blue
63:38 Marble and it's much further down in
63:40 Google Maps which is Peter projection
63:42 it'll be even further down so most of us
63:45 think the jury's in on this whole thing
63:47 and we're going to endure this weird
63:51 celebration and you know what's
63:53 interesting about it is this I don't
63:55 know if there's anything like it in
63:58 American history or world history as
64:01 Americans perceive it because I can't
64:03 speak for anyone else is there an event
64:06 that we celebrate or mourn or whatever
64:09 that was completely completely fake I
64:12 mean Pearl Harbor was allowed to happen
64:14 that's official history now it was a an
64:17 F F that's not the same we still mourn
64:22 the deaths of individuals that died at
64:25 least we're paying respects to those
64:27 that were sabotage by Roosevelt but
64:31 we're celebrating footage
64:34 that was shot in a studio as if we
64:38 actually went to a place we didn't go
64:39 and let me remind you China has said
64:44 they'd been there twice now at least
64:46 right so one on the light side and now
64:48 one on the dark side and their
64:50 photographs are utterly hilarious it's
64:54 bad enough their spacewalks have more
64:56 bubbles than an 7up commercial but their
65:00 terrains the first train I saw in their
65:03 first landing was look like it was just
65:05 up in the hills in China brown dirt
65:07 everywhere with little ice caps on the
65:10 ground oh wow really there's ice on the
65:13 moon's surface
65:14 interesting but never no one ever talked
65:16 about that and by the way all the
65:17 pictures from the Moon in six successful
65:20 missions supposedly didn't have any
65:23 brown soil didn't have any ice caps
65:25 anywhere and then their second mission
65:29 was to land on the Dark Side of the Moon
65:31 well I think that even an official truth
65:35 science the Dark Side of the Moon is
65:38 pockmarked unlike the light side meaning
65:41 the sheer ratio of these little burpee
65:45 plasma craters that are all over the
65:48 back side is way more intense than the
65:50 front side what do their photographs
65:53 look like pretty much smooth brown soil
65:58 and what's funny about the brown soil
66:01 photographs is that you've depending on
66:02 which ones you find you'll find the
66:05 brown soil ones and then you'll find
66:06 updated ones same exact shot with grey
66:11 volcanic dust or whatever they used in
66:13 the first missions here on earth trying
66:16 to cover up the fact the China released
66:18 some pretty bad simulations of what the
66:20 moon looks like what blows my mind about
66:25 the China's space program is that when
66:30 you look at the construction of Chinese
66:32 buildings especially the one in
66:33 Australia that they think they're gonna
66:34 have to tear down it would seem that
66:38 they're unable to connect a wall with
66:40 the ceiling I mean like they were taking
66:42 this this famous building in Australia
66:44 if you look it up it's it's like
66:47 skyscraper to the billionaires is now in
66:50 jeopardy of you know it's been fully
66:52 condemned no one's allowed to live there
66:54 their squatter still in there but
66:55 they're not supposed to be there but
66:57 they took off the ceiling tiles and
66:58 found out that walls were going up and
67:00 not connecting with the support being
67:02 above well going to go find your friends
67:05 who are architects and say is cement
67:09 poured cement important within the steel
67:13 girder structure of a building to add
67:15 more integrity to its form and I think
67:18 they'll say yes I just watched another
67:21 video where a building is has been
67:24 completely built and they were shoveling
67:26 this paper mache concrete that was
67:29 poured all over the building to hold it
67:31 together because it had too much water
67:34 in it most likely and or not enough
67:37 water I'm not sure what happened it
67:38 didn't turn into cement it turned into
67:40 like this great dust
67:43 there's the galleries of all the Chinese
67:46 construction where you have crazy you
67:49 know you know windows in front of
67:53 telephone poles and balconies that can't
67:55 go anywhere and all this other stuff so
67:57 it would seem that there you know there
68:00 are a few decades if not half a century
68:02 or more away from achieving first world
68:04 standards and construction you know will
68:08 overlook all the fact that you leave
68:09 videos these people getting chewed up in
68:10 machines because they don't have any
68:12 safety regulations over there in a lot
68:14 of places but this is supposed to be a
68:17 country that's just barfing out moon
68:20 missions and and you know space stations
68:22 and all this other stuff but again their
68:25 space station footage has the most
68:26 convincing internal water chamber
68:30 mistakes of any splitters we have we
68:34 have them too in our system of situation
68:36 but they tend them you know a little
68:37 more polish we've been doing a little
68:39 longer the ISS is really confusing
68:43 because there's some footage that looks
68:44 utterly convincing where you get a tour
68:47 of the ISS the camera never shuts off
68:49 and the the woman with the black you
68:52 know frilly hair she is just going
68:55 through chamber after chamber turning
68:57 corners the camera never turns off and
68:59 you're like God habit
68:59 do that because this chickens not CG how
69:03 would they do this you know they did the
69:04 movie gravity which seemed to reveal a
69:06 lot of the plugins created for a lot of
69:08 this fake space stuff in a movie well
69:11 Sandra Bullock's body was see g'd pretty
69:15 much entirely until she got into a
69:17 capsule with George Clooney and then you
69:20 can see real-life action footage but
69:23 they show you the making of the movie if
69:25 you watch it but then we have obvious AR
69:30 VR we have you know one of the
69:34 astronauts is spinning this little furry
69:37 doll and the cord that it was on
69:39 stressed out and it flipped back the
69:41 other way and she grabbed it real quick
69:43 and then she looks off-camera
69:44 who's she looking at you know the guy in
69:47 the black harness and the t-joint two
69:49 guys were talking to the kids down down
69:51 on earth and there's a tea joint in the
69:53 tube behind between the two of them and
69:54 a guy flies by on a black harness what
69:58 was that all about I've never seen this
70:02 tour of the ISS where they say we use
70:03 harnesses to make sure that we don't
70:05 bang into the walls they should say that
70:07 they should say we put harnesses on when
70:09 we talk to you guys because it keeps us
70:10 more stable all these loop-de-loops
70:14 these guys do on camera and guys we
70:16 should over and grabbing their wire and
70:17 their clothing you know poles like this
70:19 pulls out from their body because
70:21 there's a wire attached to them I don't
70:23 know what to you know there's obviously
70:25 the guy that went down the tube and
70:27 grabbed the edge of the doorway and
70:30 popped himself through a doorway in a
70:31 ninety degree turn and he starts to lose
70:33 his a pass City as he enters the other
70:35 tube direction as if there's a blue
70:38 screen going on George Bush Senior going
70:41 into the hurricane center in Texas in
70:43 Houston
70:44 NASA's headquarters to watch the
70:47 hurricane and on the big projector is
70:50 one of the astronauts who's in front of
70:52 an AR blue screen with the grid and
70:55 juggling balls and stuff and it's all CG
70:57 he's real but they're seeing stuff in on
71:00 it in that earlier that week he was
71:02 doing that a little experiment in front
71:03 of kids without the green screen he know
71:05 it that the blue screen whatever oh my
71:09 god what's it gonna take to convince
71:12 normal human beings that this stuff is
71:14 not real to a great extent I don't
71:19 believe we have secret bases on other
71:21 planets I don't believe we have you know
71:23 an ISS running off to do a big
71:26 Armageddon movie episode I don't believe
71:28 that at all I think that's a cheap way
71:30 to write a blank check what else is
71:34 going on right now there's the I know I
71:39 say this without getting you know zapped
71:42 there are people that research thing
71:45 research a lot of things inside that
71:47 movement that's going on and one of them
71:50 came out and dropped this whole you know
71:51 information bomb and said the press is
71:55 going to work together with the the DSS
72:00 to fake a alien sighting and it's going
72:06 to galvanize the world just like you
72:09 know was at Ronald Reagan's speech he
72:11 did where he talked about hey if we had
72:15 an alien invasion we would all get under
72:17 one roof and then we wouldn't be
72:19 individual human beings in a racist
72:21 world we'd be all just human beings and
72:23 we would be being visited by other
72:25 beings for another place and lot a lot a
72:28 lot oh okay
72:30 well there's been a lot of press around
72:32 that event occurring there saying that
72:36 sightings are are up now considerably
72:39 all over all over the world supposedly I
72:42 mean there's this there's this picture
72:44 and I'm not sure I think he could be a
72:46 million other things but at the July 4th
72:50 celebration at Washington DC there's a
72:53 shot going out towards the westin
72:54 monument and there's like six or seven
72:56 white dots all in a row flying in the
72:59 air and people are like oh my god they
73:00 came to visit us why would they visit
73:03 and show themselves and not land or do a
73:05 little maneuver or something it doesn't
73:06 make any sense why there's there's
73:08 nothing conclusive about that my thought
73:11 was that that was military vehicles with
73:13 sunlight on them I could be wrong I
73:16 wasn't I watched a big portion of that
73:19 but I didn't see that live or anything I
73:20 wasn't there didn't hear a lot of
73:24 you know I mean there should have been a
73:26 hundred thousand people tweeting the
73:29 picture that got off their phones we
73:31 could see it from a million different
73:31 angles and proof I didn't see that so I
73:35 don't know there's a similarity with the
73:39 legitimate visit from a UFO and you know
73:42 people walking out and going hey you
73:44 know
73:45 Klaatu Barada nikto and figuring out a
73:50 way to deal with a big untruth being
73:55 revealed it frustrates me to think that
73:59 there's people out there in the
74:00 government that go well we're never
74:01 going to reveal this we'll lose too much
74:03 face so we're just going to continue
74:07 lying about it because what that does is
74:09 that will mandate a First Amendment
74:15 problem because anyone that continues to
74:19 study it reveal it prove it will be
74:21 silenced and so you clear the swamp out
74:24 all you want and governments around the
74:27 world but if we're still willing to hide
74:28 this one secret then we still have a
74:31 virus within all governments that
74:34 participate in it and because now it
74:37 seems like NASA's for sale this whole
74:39 thing yeah you've got a country and you
74:40 want to make your people feel feel good
74:42 about yourself is your leader indicted
74:43 for crimes is your way of managing your
74:46 people not working out because communism
74:48 is is not working out we'll study the
74:52 whole you know Acme kid to fake going to
74:55 the moon you know we put probes on Mars
74:58 supposedly now again if you had a
75:03 platform to get to Mars you would test
75:05 it on the closest celestial body you can
75:07 get your hands on which would be the
75:08 moon and if you have this rover that
75:12 lasts an ungodly amount of years right
75:15 with 17 years now 19 years now for the
75:19 the Odyssey and the other one wouldn't
75:23 you put it on the moon in a nice safe
75:25 place and then over time on this really
75:28 small rock that's only twelve hundred
75:29 miles a diameter roughly once you drive
75:32 to all the moon sets
75:35 I mean I'll drive to all the LEM
75:37 kickstands
75:38 drive up to the Rovers that are up there
75:39 and drive up to where all these people
75:41 spent their time and where we made
75:43 history you would if you were really
75:46 doing it but you don't if you're lying
75:48 and that's what we have a lie a lie that
75:53 needs to be dealt with I can tell you
75:56 right now that NASA is pulling out all
75:59 the stops on this 50th anniversary the
76:01 amount of people that they've contacted
76:03 to be a part of this thing is huge and
76:07 so hmm you think ok well let's just say
76:10 we all sat in the Pentagon and we came
76:12 up with a plan to reveal this and it's
76:17 it's something it's gonna take a little
76:18 while we're gonna we got a ten-year plan
76:20 we don't have a two-year plan we got a
76:21 ten-year plan a couple things you
76:24 wouldn't do you wouldn't skip at a
76:27 celebration you would have to have the
76:29 celebration you would but probably what
76:32 you wouldn't do is say you're going back
76:34 in 2024 to stay and build space stations
76:36 you probably wouldn't launch a brand-new
76:38 lie now have they figured out a way to
76:42 get there I don't know we'll never know
76:45 because they're not going to tell us
76:49 just something we have to deal with so
76:53 this is another little bonus episode
76:56 it's happening in the summer 2019 so I
76:58 have to do it out of the pocket of the
77:00 the new show these show is gonna feel
77:02 like this show just gonna be better
77:04 subjects I think but anyway I want to
77:07 throw this out there to get your
77:08 thoughts let me know what you're
77:09 thinking let me know what you would you
77:12 do what would you personally do I think
77:14 that's important if you haven't been to
77:16 deep thoughts radio.com please go it's
77:18 completely redesigned it is now getting
77:20 a lot of traffic it is three times the
77:23 traffic it used to have because it is a
77:25 search field as a category section all
77:27 the links for video and audio are up
77:29 there all the links for our social media
77:31 is up there which is a locked Facebook
77:32 group a Twitter page which just
77:35 basically announces the feeds when they
77:36 come out two ways to donate to the pea
77:38 to the movements one through patreon and
77:41 one through PayPal for those of you are
77:42 hanging on in the newcomers thank you so
77:44 much for joining there's all new
77:47 remastered season 1 if you see any of
77:50 the season 1 episodes on the web
77:52 you're getting the latest and greatest
77:53 they've been edited for all kinds of
77:55 reasons removing for private air music
77:57 balancing the audio and cutting out a
77:58 bunch of pauses and cigar drags and all
78:02 that stuff so it's much better
78:03 experience I'm gonna leave the for now
78:06 leave the season one on this channel so
78:09 you'll still have the old methods but a
78:11 lot more not visible in Europe so if
78:13 you're trying to find numbers that don't
78:14 exist that every single one of them
78:16 exists but 99.9% of them exist so get up
78:19 there and click on that as well but love
78:22 to have you join the Facebook group it's
78:24 an amazing group of people really nice
78:26 we don't all agree but we really treat
78:29 each other well in the process so anyway
78:32 until the next episode take care of
78:34 yourself and someone else and I'll see
78:36 in the next deep thoughts over now
