00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this gorgeous day Wiccans
00:43 are the best right so today I'm gonna
00:47 talk about sort of make it in making it
00:51 in Hollywood or making it in show
00:52 business it's something that I think is
00:58 rarely really discussed from anyone
01:01 who's actually seen a huge number of
01:04 successes and failures in various
01:06 industries I come to you in a very
01:09 special capacity that I have seen I've
01:14 seen the following industries pretty
01:15 closely and had I have family members if
01:18 I wasn't in it personally I've got
01:20 family members that are in it here in LA
01:24 and my family is not always
01:27 blood-related you know when you move
01:30 away from home you tend to spend more
01:33 time with your friends than your family
01:35 and your family turns into your friend
01:37 and your friends turn to your family I
01:39 was personally in the video game
01:42 business I did absolutely every single
01:44 job that you can do in that business
01:46 including on my owning my own company a
01:49 couple times the music business I've
01:53 seen it all the way up to you know
01:56 family members of mine with five
01:57 platinum albums to my own endeavors for
02:00 video games and personal efforts that I
02:02 made a lot of money doing in the mid 90s
02:05 and then there's film and television
02:09 most of my personal experiences in film
02:13 I've done plenty of interviews about
02:15 television there's just a lot of
02:19 financial benefits to being in the
02:21 television business television used to
02:23 be a joke you know people would really
02:25 say I wouldn't want to be anywhere but
02:27 the silver screen and today television
02:29 blows away the silver screen in most
02:32 cases now in terms of television and
02:34 film you know most of my experience is
02:39 obviously behind the camera I've never
02:40 personally been and I've been in front
02:42 of the camera couple times but the
02:45 scenes got cut man you'll find it's much
02:48 more interesting behind the camera and
02:49 the lifespan of your career is
02:51 exceptionally longer behind the camera
02:54 right if you want to be in famous in
02:57 front of the camera but then you need to
02:59 look at how long a sports player
03:01 typically is famous how long a musicians
03:03 famous if you're a female it's very very
03:06 tough they only want you during your
03:08 cute little you know rubbery days of
03:11 your skins tight and all that kind of
03:12 stuff they won't want you as much once
03:16 you get wrinkles it's a brutal world
03:19 it's a brutal world it's a very brave
03:22 thing to get into so I'm gonna go
03:25 through some of the things that I went
03:26 through and being in the Midwest without
03:30 any of this and looking at it from afar
03:32 and then what I found when I got here
03:35 when you're sitting in the Midwest or
03:37 sitting in any remote location and your
03:40 life is just it's good it's great it's
03:42 balanced you get your family around you
03:43 your friends whatever but the major
03:46 thing that comes into your life that is
03:48 completely different than the sort of
03:51 average frequency of happiness is music
03:54 is television is film you see these
03:58 things and they're bigger than life
03:59 people get on stage and they are
04:00 unbelievably talented maybe you go to
04:03 concerts and your local Arab maybe
04:05 you're too young for that and you're
04:06 just really listening to it on the
04:08 internet you know downloading it you're
04:12 watching movies in the movie theater
04:14 movies on your house Netflix seeing them
04:16 HB owing them television shows you look
04:21 at publicity some TMZ thing and you see
04:25 people loving some
04:26 and you thank God I would really love to
04:30 be in the pool of all that acceptance
04:32 right Sally Fields thing right her
04:37 Mandela effect you love me you really
04:39 love me turn into you like me right now
04:40 you really like me but Sally Fields
04:43 showed us an amazing gift because she
04:47 wasn't and for those of you don't know
04:48 what I'm talking about she went up and
04:50 got an Oscar once in late 90s and she
04:52 essentially poured out her heart about
04:56 what really was going on for her which
04:59 was the people were loving her work and
05:04 that meant something to her and it was
05:06 the entire reason why she became an
05:08 actress was to get the love in her life
05:10 that she wasn't getting from anywhere
05:12 else and everybody just kind of whoa is
05:15 that what we're all about and the answer
05:16 is hell yes that's what you're about I
05:19 did an episode on Fame and I did an
05:22 episode on talent in both those episodes
05:23 are really good sort of follow up
05:26 courses to this particular episode in
05:30 the talent episode I really just
05:31 breakdown you know how you get it you
05:34 know and this thing called natural
05:36 talent and what that really is and Fame
05:38 I tell you there really shouldn't be
05:41 anything like that in your life in terms
05:44 of your goal-setting towards Fame if you
05:46 set a goal to fame you will almost
05:49 invariably never be successful at what
05:51 you're doing
05:52 fame is something that just simply
05:54 happens because you're doing what you
05:55 love and people love what you do but you
05:58 don't wake up in the morning and do it
06:00 for fame right but when you talk about
06:04 making it in show business or Hollywood
06:05 you're bringing together all of these
06:07 different vectors and all these
06:08 different talents and desires into one
06:10 thing and it's a sick little formula if
06:14 you get one of the ingredients off right
06:17 you could have everything else right but
06:19 you really want Fame so in desiring Fame
06:23 you're killing your talents you're
06:26 killing your opportunities you know one
06:29 of the great examples that Steve Jobs
06:30 said was look we don't make things that
06:32 we think we don't make things because
06:34 you told us do you want us to make them
06:36 we make things because we want to make
06:38 them for ourselves and we want to use
06:39 them for our
06:40 and you just happened to like them and
06:41 that's how he kept Apple on top that's
06:44 how Apple blew past all the competition
06:45 when Microsoft was having a marketing
06:48 meeting asking people what they want
06:49 when they have no clue what they want
06:50 they're not technical they don't know
06:51 what their capabilities are what the
06:53 spectrum of capability is right sadly
06:58 since Steve Jobs died Tim Cook went
07:00 right into that realm and he's killing
07:03 the company but so you come to Hollywood
07:05 let's say come to Hollywood and you
07:07 don't want Fame you really want to make
07:09 things happen but you don't bring the
07:10 talent so now you're a little trifecta
07:14 of things that you want two things that
07:15 you need to make it here you didn't
07:20 bring one of the one of the points in
07:22 the triangle the other one is really
07:27 willing to work extremely hard at what
07:31 you do right I'm gonna get this out
07:34 really quick I did this episode it was
07:35 an hour and a half and I imported it
07:38 into my Mac and of course it said it got
07:41 the video and it didn't I had I had a
07:45 huge interruption too because the guy
07:46 was doing his lawn back here so it's
07:49 better that I do this again but right
07:51 off the bat what I want to tell you is
07:53 this your Uncle Mark says if you want to
07:57 get into any of the industries I just
07:58 talked about video games music film or
08:01 television need to understand that the
08:04 people that will control your career and
08:05 again music you can do it by yourself at
08:07 your house you know if you want to get
08:09 super access to amazing producers you
08:11 can almost email them and figure out a
08:14 way to get them paid somehow but you
08:16 have to understand that the talent level
08:18 that you have to have is it has to be
08:20 everything that you have seen on
08:23 television you know if you're a dancer
08:25 you need to learn how to dance dance you
08:27 know don't you had learn how to count
08:29 and you got to learn how to dance with
08:30 others and you have to learn to
08:31 communicate because all about you know
08:34 relaying what you do and you can't not
08:38 dance in real time and think that that's
08:40 gonna work out it's not gonna work out
08:42 as much as I wish that would there's
08:44 these apps that kids use to dance and
08:46 halftime they literally play the song
08:49 and halftime these people these kids
08:51 dance they do amazing jobs but it's not
08:52 reality right
08:53 how can you tell a movie said okay
08:55 everybody go slow-motion I dearly wish
08:58 that works but it won't work if you sing
09:02 to radio music and you think you can
09:04 sing well you need to get a recorder out
09:06 and record your voice and listen to it
09:07 back and let other people listen to it
09:09 back who are singers people who are
09:11 music teachers ask them if you're in
09:13 tune you need to feel songs from the
09:16 heart you want to be an actress
09:19 or an actor well you're gonna have to
09:22 get scripts and do them and you're gonna
09:24 have to get scripts that are completely
09:26 opposite of who you are as a human being
09:27 and do those two and that's just the
09:30 basics that's just the basics you got to
09:32 come up with this stuff you want to play
09:33 an instrument you have to be able to get
09:36 on stage someone says what key you're in
09:38 and you and just they can read off like
09:40 five note transitions give you some
09:42 general structure for the melody you
09:44 need to have played 300 songs if not
09:47 three thousand different songs and when
09:49 someone says okay it's just like James
09:51 Brown song Papa Bob but we're gonna make
09:53 a little transition here you need to go
09:55 yes okay I got it but if you want to be
09:58 a musician you're gonna have to write
09:59 your own music because they're not
10:00 sitting around waiting for you to do
10:01 covers that's for wedding singers and
10:04 you know high school performances or
10:08 something if you are even remotely
10:12 talented enough to join the forces of
10:15 Hollywood then wherever you exist your
10:19 entire community knows that you're the
10:21 best at that thing what do I mean by
10:24 that if you want to come to Hollywood
10:27 and do some band stuff and you play the
10:29 guitar that means if you live in
10:31 Colorado Springs the whole town knows
10:35 your name and the whole town goes that
10:37 dude or that girl is the best guitar
10:40 player I mean I went to that Club and
10:41 they walked in and it was like Jimi
10:43 Hendrix or England Malmsteen or whatever
10:45 it is they blew us away non-stop could
10:48 have played for four hours straight
10:50 they're so good if you're saying you
10:52 have to be that talented if you're a
10:54 dancer you have to be the best dancer in
10:57 your town and and you should probably
10:59 just not out of seeking fame but just
11:01 out of word-of-mouth people go that girl
11:04 or that dude is the most amazing dancer
11:07 I've ever seen you're in plays you're in
11:09 all kinds of stuff because you can't
11:11 stop it it's what you do it's what you
11:13 love and you're so damn good at it but
11:17 no one can stop you that's here
11:19 everywhere it goes on and on down the
11:23 line obviously if you're a programmer
11:24 and you want to get into video games
11:25 you're already a badass programmer and
11:28 you've already created your own game
11:29 before I ever moved to California to get
11:33 into various arts especially doing video
11:36 games I don't know how many video games
11:39 I created between the age of 11 and 17
11:42 the first thing I ever created was a
11:44 video game in fact I think I created
11:46 three video games for every utility I
11:48 ever wrote you know my my computer had
11:52 32k of RAM okay a megabyte is a thousand
11:57 24k right now we have gigabytes and
12:01 gigabytes of RAM right right now we have
12:04 a disease that people want this fame and
12:06 they also want to take as many shortcuts
12:08 as possible as if there's some sort of
12:11 shortcut to Talent there's absolutely no
12:14 shortcut to Talent there's a shortcut to
12:16 opportunity right you've got the talent
12:19 it is amazing and you now would normally
12:22 have to go through this say this company
12:24 to get discovered but the shortcut is
12:26 you go create your own company you were
12:28 going to have to go through millions of
12:30 auditions instead you go to a party and
12:32 you meet the right person there's plenty
12:35 of shortcuts for opportunity but again
12:38 if you don't bring the talent what's
12:39 going to happen is you'll have that
12:41 once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you
12:43 won't bring the talent and then your
12:45 name goes in a little black book of
12:47 never ever talk to this person again and
12:50 those books exist they exist up here in
12:52 our heads in Hollywood and they exist in
12:56 true written form I've been to clients
12:59 with our clients sites using their
13:01 houses and I was in their office I've
13:04 seen this a couple times and there's a
13:06 list of like 30 names and it says the
13:08 [ __ ] list across the top I even knew one
13:11 of the guys on the [ __ ] list I saw and I
13:13 was so I asked said what is this and my
13:16 client was like that's our [ __ ] list
13:18 those people have earned themselves a
13:19 place and the never
13:20 talk to you category and I have one guy
13:25 on my list hollywood sees the best
13:29 talent in the world all the time the
13:32 best talent they turn it down all the
13:35 time they have to pick there's only one
13:37 chair that's gonna be a role in a movie
13:40 and there's a thousand kids outside
13:44 auditioning for that role what are they
13:46 gonna do give out trophies for effort
13:48 no because the real world doesn't work
13:50 like that right they're gonna pick the
13:52 very best kid that matches every single
13:54 little nuance of the script and that kid
13:56 gets a job and I guarantee you in most
14:00 cases they know they've left behind four
14:01 or five other kids they might hire a
14:03 couple kids as alternatives in case
14:05 something happens to them in character
14:07 but if you aren't super mega special
14:10 stay home and have kids get a normal job
14:13 and if you think that's a competitive
14:17 term like I got a competing with you or
14:19 pissing on your parade and if I take all
14:21 that anger and turn it into Talent
14:24 double triple quadruple your talent be
14:28 amazing because you're gonna have to
14:30 have people in the industry turn their
14:33 head and go whoa was that coming out of
14:37 you
14:37 did you just sing those notes holy [ __ ]
14:40 all right let's do this again maybe that
14:43 was a freak accident you know you add
14:46 you audition and they're blown away you
14:48 captured all the emotion you danced in
14:50 real time and you danced awesome and
14:52 they go wow I've never seen any of those
14:55 moves before and I've seen a lot because
14:57 the internet exists now right now if you
15:00 even remotely have a chance of
15:02 succeeding in these industries then my
15:04 next comment will not be something I
15:07 need to tell you but I'm going to say it
15:09 because you will be surrounded by the
15:11 losers who need to hear this comment
15:15 okay hope that makes sense and I say it
15:19 very specifically like that because
15:21 that's what these people who would
15:22 contradict this recommendation
15:24 we'll turn into and they'll be very
15:27 angry that they were wrong I'm telling
15:32 you some basic hard truths about getting
15:34 in this stuff right and what will happen
15:37 with the losers is that they will run
15:40 off and try to talk to other losers who
15:44 will tell them that there are shortcuts
15:46 to everything I'm telling them but
15:49 somehow they don't have to have any
15:50 Talent
15:51 and what they'll do was those sites and
15:52 anomaly on the internet some you know
15:55 Kim Kardashian who made a porn who is
15:58 you know by some standards hot as hell
16:01 right she has been at times right she's
16:05 a mother now withdrawal too many
16:07 comments like that about her she got her
16:10 whole family famous now her father was a
16:12 famous attorney worked on the OJ Simpson
16:14 case it wasn't exactly like they started
16:15 from zero yeah plenty of money to sit
16:17 around and [ __ ] around but they turned
16:20 it into something and they parlayed it
16:22 right in the middle of this ghastly you
16:24 know reality show stuff and if any of
16:27 you believe that stuff is real stay
16:29 where you are please all reality shows
16:33 are scripted regardless if they're real
16:35 or not in terms of say like a guy's
16:37 treasure hunting in a cargo container
16:39 which at that place that show was
16:41 completely fake but they'll come in the
16:43 room and say ok you need to have an
16:45 argument with this person I don't care
16:47 what you do just argue roll it Sam go
16:50 action and then they just ad lib
16:54 something together get really angry it's
16:56 not real
16:59 hopefully it's not that entertaining to
17:01 you typically if you are someone who was
17:04 talented you are your list of people
17:06 that can actually entertain you is
17:08 extremely short if you have any hope of
17:12 making it in this industry out here and
17:15 I sit down with you and I say who are
17:17 your influences there are some pretty
17:20 deeply rooted influences and when I say
17:22 why is that person influenced to you you
17:24 have a really good answer and you
17:27 probably will not have a single teeny
17:29 Bop pop star on your list right because
17:34 you understand that there is a void that
17:38 your
17:38 with your talent what do I mean by that
17:42 we know that today's entertainment is
17:44 very plasticky you know the amount of
17:47 people that are famous for doing
17:49 something but have really contributed
17:51 very little to the actual brilliance of
17:54 what they're doing is well over 50% for
17:59 instance when I grew up in the 70s I was
18:02 surrounded by mega talent and I mean
18:04 mega talent man you turned on the movies
18:06 and the actors were all phenomenal
18:08 actors you turn on TV and you had
18:10 legendary shows on TV you have I don't
18:15 know you're trying to say well you know
18:16 maybe you're just that's what you
18:17 consider to be legendary and we have
18:19 legendary shows today it's like we have
18:20 legendary HBO shows we have legendary
18:22 Netflix shows but normal cable is just
18:24 you know sugar and on your throat puke
18:28 but the music the artists wrote and
18:31 arranged and performed their own music
18:35 they didn't buy it from somebody else
18:37 right
18:38 even Elton John that never wrote a
18:40 single lyric he wrote up the music to
18:43 the lyrics he wrote the music
18:46 it is the music that makes anything you
18:48 know sing literally speaking right so
18:53 today you have folks that are talented
18:56 like tikka Justin Bieber very talented
19:00 kid he can really sing he plays the
19:02 drums and he has his you know we all
19:04 don't really think that fondly of him
19:06 here in Los Angeles cuz we see his
19:08 bratty [ __ ] but he's a kid so
19:09 whatever but he's got pipes and he can
19:12 sing by the age of 14 he was he had he
19:16 was special at 14 because he didn't play
19:19 basketball he didn't [ __ ] around with a
19:21 bunch of other stuff he focused on his
19:24 skill set and so when he auditioned for
19:28 Usher 14 I believe that's his age I sure
19:30 just went what uh sure was the same
19:33 exact thing I sure was a little Michael
19:35 Jackson he could dance and sing and he
19:38 had a style he still does to this day
19:39 but he found Justin Bieber and it was
19:41 all over now Justin doesn't write his
19:44 own music he just sings he doesn't write
19:46 the lyrics half the time he is saying
19:51 Kelly Clarkson song sir
19:52 but he has you know through his
19:54 producers and to the people around him
19:56 he's able to create songs that people
19:58 fall in love with and there's nothing
19:59 wrong with that okay but you need to
20:03 know you would need that huge support
20:06 team behind you if you're gonna come in
20:07 at his level but what did he bring
20:09 he brought well he brought some
20:11 fortunate jigs right he's not ugly
20:15 especially the you know the 12 year old
20:17 girls that like the 14 year old kid
20:18 right I've obviously never seen him on
20:20 stage but I know the people who have and
20:22 they you know I've seen videos I've been
20:23 playing the drums blew me away that was
20:25 awesome and you know I'll even find
20:27 myself in some retail outlet that's
20:29 playing his song and I'm like oh that's
20:31 pretty good son oh crap that's just a
20:32 beaver wow so some people will see him
20:38 as a shortcut but he just auditioned for
20:41 Usher and then boom he got his career
20:42 and it's like okay you're right you're
20:44 absolutely right but what did he bring
20:47 and what do you think his life was like
20:49 after he got selected by Usher as the
20:52 other side stepping thing people don't
20:54 think about the amount of pressure on a
20:57 talented person it was being used to
21:01 sell either movie tickets or advertising
21:04 on a television show or singles on
21:08 iTunes is go go go you cannot rest you
21:15 cannot hold still if you get any time
21:17 off it is very limited and you're
21:20 usually struggling to get somewhere in
21:23 the world that you really want to be
21:24 right if you're a musician and you have
21:28 to go on the road which is the only way
21:29 you ever make any money and for those of
21:32 you who think you're gonna make money
21:34 off iTunes good luck right you know
21:37 musicians they do release their albums
21:40 and once you do release one gigantic
21:42 platinum album the next platinum album
21:45 is a lot easier right but it's that
21:46 first one it's a pain in the ass right
21:48 so the first one you're gonna have to
21:50 tour the world tour your region of the
21:53 world to make sure people know you exist
21:56 because they don't know you exist and
21:58 what you know they go to the record
22:00 store and they don't know they go to
22:01 iTunes they don't search on your name so
22:04 that first kernel
22:05 of acknowledgment stuff but how do you
22:08 get on tour where you're gonna have to
22:10 perform somewhere where someone's gonna
22:11 see you and say you should open for
22:14 whatever band you should open for Justin
22:17 Bieber you should open for Black Sabbath
22:19 because you're of that ilk of music the
22:21 people who already are coming to the
22:23 stage want to see you want to see that
22:25 type of music you're just more of the
22:26 great stuff that you know they already
22:30 want but you're gonna have to tour and
22:34 record at the exact same time you're
22:36 going to be in a bus and I'm telling you
22:39 this this whole thing you'll see you
22:41 know rock videos or whatever and
22:42 everyone's flying from point A to point
22:44 B on private jets let me tell you it
22:47 happens okay but within a particular
22:50 music genre where you have all the
22:52 musicians that are amazing in that genre
22:54 the legends of the 70s where you had a
22:57 lot fewer bands right because we'd have
22:59 the internet to make everyone release a
23:02 song which is fine - it's actually
23:04 really great that we got a lot more
23:06 music nowadays but back in the day when
23:08 the money was SuperDuper focus there's
23:10 only a few bands that could just hop in
23:12 a Learjet and go anywhere they wanted to
23:14 is that shit's really expensive a lot of
23:18 bands with tons of platinum albums we're
23:21 driving in buses because it's the only
23:23 way to afford it
23:24 and imagine you're doing a concert in
23:27 Detroit and then you've got to go to New
23:29 York City within 24 or 48 hours so
23:33 you're gonna bust the whole time and
23:36 sleeping on those things is tough you
23:38 got people hanging around you that want
23:40 you to pay attention to them you get
23:42 there you're exhausted but you got to go
23:45 onstage and perform for 90 minutes two
23:49 hours and you're supposed to be writing
23:51 new music at the same exact time that's
23:53 supposed to be better than your last
23:54 album meanwhile you're broke because
23:58 your record deal is so screwball it was
24:02 really interesting I was you know I only
24:06 tell you this that you understand the
24:09 circles that I'm in so I'm not really
24:11 very close to the music industry anymore
24:13 because the bands that I worked with
24:15 have broken up they're not too
24:17 whatever sort of been gone for two or
24:20 three years okay
24:21 but there's one band out there that's
24:24 doing really really well they're a
24:25 household word in a particular genre and
24:29 I thought that bad record deals were
24:31 over I thought that once it was exposed
24:34 that you know Chuck Berry had a bad
24:36 contract Little Richard had a bad
24:38 contract and various people came around
24:40 and helped them out like Michael Jackson
24:42 I think bought up all Little Richard
24:43 stuff and gave it back to him so he
24:44 could make some money in his lifetime
24:46 if that stuff was over and apparently it
24:51 is alive and well to this day there's
24:53 still horrible record contracts out
24:55 there and the other problem is is that
24:58 sometimes there's a decent record
24:59 contract but the artist really wants to
25:03 be super rich and super famous and they
25:05 don't really make that much money in
25:07 fact most these guys don't make more
25:08 money than your father your mother I
25:10 mean it's amazing or you you know they
25:13 might make say a hundred and fifty
25:14 thousand dollars a year but they want to
25:17 live like they're making 1.5 million a
25:19 year and so they're buying cars or
25:21 leasing cars and renting homes buying
25:23 clothing and they have no money to pay
25:26 for it at all so within the last six
25:29 months I was made aware of a story or a
25:32 piece of truth actually about an
25:34 individual who is in a really great band
25:36 and he's broke he's absolutely broke in
25:40 fact he's in debt several hundred
25:42 thousand dollars and it's partly because
25:43 he got a clunky record deal but the
25:46 other part is that he's spending too
25:47 much and the the fear is that he's going
25:51 to end his career because he has a life
25:53 span in his career okay this band has
25:57 been around for quite a while it's very
25:58 very successful however the end is
26:01 within probably half a decade of the big
26:03 money and if something doesn't change
26:07 the bankruptcy doesn't help him out and
26:09 he gets us kind of back on his gears
26:11 he's gonna end up really really upset
26:15 with his life so here's the other thing
26:18 about building your talents right now
26:21 some of you have a talent and it's
26:24 amazing it's it's one of those talents
26:26 you just bumped into as a kid your brain
26:28 literally clicks with that talent
26:30 whatever
26:31 is if you're comedian you're a total ham
26:33 you've been a ham your whole life right
26:35 if you're a comedian or an actor in fact
26:37 you know really any one of these things
26:39 you need to be pretty much a ham you
26:41 like getting in front of people you're
26:42 not shy at all because how could you be
26:45 how could you be if you're going to be
26:46 entertaining masses some people try to
26:52 record everything at home and this is
26:55 for everything comedians and actors and
26:57 musicians they try to live in a
26:59 laboratory and then once they kind of
27:01 realize by talking to agents and
27:03 managers that that just simply doesn't
27:04 work monetarily speaking you have to get
27:06 up and perform in front of a live
27:08 audience again you could be on a sitcom
27:10 and you're gonna have to walk out in
27:12 front of a live audience
27:13 think about being on a show like
27:14 Saturday Night Live you're not only in a
27:17 front of a live audience but you're
27:19 reading your lines on cards because they
27:21 change between rehearsal and the actual
27:23 show time so you got to be comfortable
27:27 reading in front of millions of people
27:29 watching you on television talk about
27:31 some pressure right very few people in
27:34 this world actually believe their own
27:35 hype if they're successful Elvis Presley
27:39 perfect example talk about a gentleman
27:42 from the south he never believed the
27:44 hype about him ever but he was the king
27:48 of rock right and so he got extremely
27:50 nervous before he would go on stage like
27:52 I said in previous episodes so you know
27:54 this already he'd forget his lyrics you
27:57 said I forget my lyrics but the music
28:01 starts playing and it all starts coming
28:02 back to you just weird experience how
28:06 rappers do it it blows me away how they
28:09 can go on an amount of lyrics are just
28:10 unbelievable and they're dense and and
28:13 they've rearranged all their songs from
28:15 the album dates and so it's like well
28:17 how did you make the song today because
28:18 it's a little bit different than you did
28:19 it last year at your other concert the
28:21 other tour what I have found in my own
28:24 travels is that you will be by yourself
28:27 at your house whether you have family
28:29 around your knots sort of irrelevant and
28:31 you'll be practicing your art whatever
28:34 that is right and you can only go so far
28:38 if any of you've ever seen a domain
28:40 donation thermometer on a piece of paper
28:43 right some
28:44 churches raising money you know the
28:46 firefighters are trying to raise money
28:47 and your schools trying to raise money
28:50 you go by that thermometer every day
28:51 it's like maybe it's a can drive or
28:53 something and they keep filling in the
28:55 red you know keeps going up and up and
28:57 up I want you to put that thermometer in
29:00 your head when it comes to making it out
29:01 here which is that if you're just
29:03 sitting there by yourself at your house
29:06 under most circumstances okay the
29:09 skillset that you need to succeed is the
29:11 hundred percent thing right I think
29:15 personally and this is just sort of my
29:18 like gut experience with a bunch of
29:20 celebrities I've been able to work with
29:22 and hearing because I interview them
29:24 about their life I say look how did you
29:25 get started where were the challenges
29:26 what did you think and what were you
29:28 corrected on about your perception of
29:31 the world sitting at home by yourself
29:34 you can probably fill in about 25% of
29:37 the thermometer but then there's a
29:38 ceiling there's nothing you can do at
29:40 home to put another pixel of red ink in
29:43 that thermometer you've got to get out
29:46 and work with some other people to
29:48 continue the flow of the thermometer
29:50 right now I'm going to parse that other
29:53 75% of this thermometer but this is just
29:56 kind of a guideline don't think of it as
29:59 like a rulebook he said that the next
30:02 25% has to be done this way yeah you can
30:05 you could if you have the guts you can
30:07 skip ahead of one of these steps and
30:09 you'll automatically get credit for the
30:10 section before but let's just say you're
30:14 a musician or an actor right those are
30:16 really the two main realms were going
30:18 for here
30:19 you're gonna have to go from your
30:21 basement or your garage and you're gonna
30:22 have to perform in front of live people
30:24 in a small venue at least right you
30:27 could even say you're gonna perform for
30:29 your family but the problem with your
30:30 family is is that they're going to tend
30:32 to embellish how well you're doing you
30:36 can also get [ __ ] brothers and
30:37 sisters that hate the fact that you're
30:39 surpassing them and they'll crap on your
30:40 parade and they're completely inaccurate
30:42 in their assessment of you so best not
30:46 to use your closest family members
30:48 unless you guys are all very kumbaya and
30:50 friendly to each other when there's
30:51 families like that and it's awesome if
30:54 you're an actor you're gonna have to go
30:55 get into play you
30:57 are now there they'll be exceptions to
31:01 this rule and you'll say this guy's full
31:02 of [ __ ] because I know someone that went
31:04 from their basement directly to
31:05 commercials again they skipped the step
31:06 on talking about and that's fine
31:08 if you got the balls and you got the
31:10 guts and you have the talent then fine
31:12 if you're a comedian well what are you
31:14 gonna do you're gonna perform in front
31:15 of a mirror for a long time maybe you'll
31:17 videotape yourself watch it back later
31:18 and maybe there's a shot in the dark you
31:22 actually have an objective eye on your
31:23 own performance and you're like that
31:25 wasn't very strong how can i redo that
31:27 joke okay the lead ends a little too
31:28 long the punch takes too long okay
31:30 refined refined boom now it's a bad ass
31:32 joke but at some point you're gonna have
31:35 to go in front of other people to
31:37 validate yourself right justin bieber's
31:41 go back to that dude he was in a bunch
31:42 of talent contests right was it Ryan
31:44 Gosling was a dancer and a singer as a
31:47 little tiny kid isn't it interesting
31:49 that a lot of people that you think I
31:50 don't know just fell uphill they've been
31:53 at this forever all the Mouseketeers
31:56 from the Justin Timberlake days over to
31:59 the just Britney Spears days all of them
32:01 were in talent contests but they weren't
32:04 just job any of rameses you know letting
32:06 their mother dress them and being cute
32:07 in front of other people they were
32:08 actually performing a skill using their
32:11 voice using their mind using their heart
32:13 to bring out performances right their
32:17 talent was above average in fact it was
32:21 up there at that almost undefinable
32:24 level of damn this is so good I'm not
32:26 even sure who to compare them to it's
32:29 interesting you know before we go on
32:31 here you have Jimi Hendrix who obviously
32:34 was an amazing guitar player he lived
32:37 with his guitar once he was given a
32:38 guitar he carried it with him everywhere
32:41 he could possibly go he even had it
32:43 mailed to him when he joined the
32:44 military after going on the military he
32:47 just carried it into every store and
32:49 every place to everyone if you went to a
32:50 restaurant he carried it with him he
32:52 slept with it and when you watch him
32:54 play he's not looking at the neck to
32:57 figure out what court he's in he feels
33:00 it in his heart and soul and he just
33:02 pushes it into his right hand right but
33:05 then you have someone like Prince and
33:06 Prince obviously used a lot of Jimi's
33:12 sort of themes right the sort of paisley
33:16 looking sixties thing but he kind of
33:18 upped it to the 80s and it was cool but
33:19 you see that brother played the guitar
33:21 in your life wow there's so many things
33:23 like the way he plays it feels very
33:25 Jimmy ish but then there's this thing
33:28 that's just straight-up prints he has
33:30 his own frickin sound and so even though
33:33 you can feel the influence of Jimmy and
33:35 prints both of them are ascended to a
33:37 level that is essentially their own
33:39 mountaintop
33:41 he has his mountaintop Jimmy Brent says
33:44 his mountaintop Stevie Ray Vaughan has a
33:46 mountaintop between them they ascended
33:49 so far beyond any of the influences that
33:51 you really can't track it they became
33:53 their own amazing thing and that's what
33:55 you have to become when you watch Jack
33:58 Nicholson in his prime acting do you
34:00 really say Jack Nicholson feels like
34:02 Kirk Douglas no G Jack Nicholson is Jack
34:06 Nicholson that's why people do
34:08 impersonations of Jack Nicholson because
34:10 when you do him even mildly accurately
34:13 you know who they're impersonating
34:15 Christopher Walken Robert De Niro Al
34:20 Pacino any actor or actress that you
34:24 could put your finger on that you say
34:25 they're amazing I love them typically
34:27 they compare to no one they have their
34:29 own thing and this is what you have to
34:31 do you have to take your life experience
34:33 and instead of fighting it and trying to
34:35 impersonate someone else to so you can
34:38 get to your mountaintop you have to
34:39 build your own mountain I'll tell you
34:42 one of the things that I discovered when
34:46 I started singing as a kid I had a
34:49 friend of mine that had a band that was
34:50 doing a bunch of cover songs this is
34:52 high school and I love singing Led
34:55 Zeppelin I love singing a bunch of
34:57 different stuff but I went in to sing
34:59 for his band once and because the lead
35:02 singer threatened to quit and so he said
35:04 you know help us out here we don't think
35:05 he's gonna quit but we want you to show
35:07 up and sing in his place and when he
35:08 sees that he's gonna apologize to us
35:11 he's gonna come back to the band which
35:13 is exactly what happened actually of the
35:14 video of his side of the game but I
35:17 started singing Robert Plant and I was
35:19 trying to impersonate him because I
35:21 thought that's what they wanted and my
35:23 buddy walks
35:24 to me and goes you sound great but sing
35:27 it in your voice make it yours and it
35:31 really shocked me I was like ooh okay
35:34 fast-forward like 20 years plus 25 years
35:38 and a buddy of mine I was at a
35:40 restaurant that I used to help redo in
35:44 paint and all this other stuff and she's
35:45 my buddy's restaurant and he had a
35:47 karaoke guy come in and I at the point I
35:49 absolutely hated karaoke I thought it
35:51 was the worst excruciating thing to
35:53 witness and this guy I didn't know I'm
35:57 he's now a very close friend of mine
35:59 there's almost no one there's like two
36:01 people there and I was like man I would
36:03 never even attempt this in front of
36:05 other people
36:06 but it was just my chicken [ __ ] in this
36:08 sing in front of other people but I sang
36:10 everywhere else I go you know I've sang
36:12 on my own songs and also stuff so why am
36:15 i afraid
36:16 you know he's cheap or tone-deaf just
36:17 just butchering songs why don't I sing
36:19 so he gives me the mic and he plays like
36:21 some Guns & Roses song or something and
36:25 I sing it and he goes off to the
36:26 restroom and he comes back and he's
36:28 looking at me these big eyes and he's
36:30 like you can sing I didn't know you
36:32 could sing I was like well yeah I guess
36:34 I can jeez right and so I started
36:36 singing karaoke was funny right and it
36:40 was a really good practice for
36:41 everything that I loved it was getting
36:44 to sing the song as I love with the
36:45 passion in my heart for what I think
36:47 that songwriters meant when they wrote
36:49 the songs entertaining other people when
36:52 they scream and yell and you're done
36:53 it's pretty cool and but I started doing
36:57 the impersonation thing and so every
36:58 time some while impersonate like Bon
37:00 Scott or something and that's just fun I
37:03 know the crowd understands what I'm
37:04 doing I'm impersonating him and it's
37:07 just it's karaoke music it's not
37:09 professional music it's just something
37:11 fun to do right but just even doing
37:15 karaoke warmed me up so like four years
37:19 later after I was really just mastering
37:21 some of these songs I was invited to
37:24 sing at a wedding of a bunch of platinum
37:26 artists from the 80s it's so I go up to
37:29 stage and I am now singing live with a
37:33 real band I've never done that
37:35 particular type of configuration before
37:36 because I usually play although my own
37:38 and you know I've got name-brand 80's
37:44 glam rock people all inside the crowd
37:46 and one of my my brothers from another
37:50 mother came up to me and and he goes he
37:52 looks at me and he goes I didn't know
37:53 you could sing because that was totally
37:55 into and that was great
37:56 and I was like you know I'm looking at
37:59 myself going why just do it because I
38:00 love it but I guess I have the skill I
38:02 mean this really strange right weird you
38:07 know if I was in my 20s I'd probably
38:09 jump into it full bore and really go for
38:11 it find a band and sing for it but I'm
38:13 in my late 40s and I know what that
38:14 world is about I've seen my family
38:17 members you know run around the world at
38:20 late 50s and it kicks their ass you know
38:24 and they're so talented they can just do
38:25 it in their sleep right so endurance is
38:28 a huge thing when you talk about making
38:31 it in Hollywood because again the
38:32 pressures are on you hardcore but the
38:37 the most talented people that you admire
38:38 make it look super easy and that is the
38:41 kiss of death if you don't understand
38:43 that they're making it look easy you are
38:46 setting yourself up for a real big
38:48 disappointment that's why they're
38:51 superstars and a lot of times that's why
38:53 the drugs got involved with music
38:55 because music is way more grueling than
38:57 any acting regiment because of the buses
39:01 because of the pressure to make your
39:04 next album like an actor just has to go
39:06 in and be them and someone else writes
39:09 up all the words that they're going to
39:10 be saying and they just have to perform
39:12 it and live in that other character
39:14 become the other character again there
39:17 are exceptions to even that Heath Ledger
39:19 who went off and did the Joker locks
39:22 himself in apartment in New York for I
39:23 don't know what was it three months
39:25 becoming the Joker well that dude took
39:28 his art very very seriously and in the
39:30 end it seemed to eat him alive
39:32 right so cocaine and anything that was
39:35 an upper really became a huge part of
39:37 the music industry because it was the
39:38 only way that a human being could really
39:41 adhere to this regiment the managers and
39:44 producers that ran them did it too
39:46 but they got a lot more time off right
39:48 they could go to bed at night and then
39:50 skip the concert if they wanted to
39:52 these other guys who you think I've been
39:53 sleeping all day and a four seasons you
39:56 know super plot plate Appalachia spin
39:58 house yeah they're in a crappy [ __ ]
40:01 bunk bed and a fairly nice bus dealing
40:06 with some guy wants to play the guitar
40:08 while you're trying to sleep some guy
40:09 brought a groupie on the bus and she
40:11 can't shut the [ __ ] up it's a it was it
40:16 was at least a brutal world I've seen
40:19 this stuff personally okay I'm gonna
40:24 share a story from a guy I drop his name
40:27 every once in a while and I don't want
40:28 you to think I'm just a name drop in
40:29 here because he's one of the guys I'm
40:30 gonna mention so that you can focus on
40:32 what you know about him so you can
40:35 appreciate how easy he makes it look all
40:37 right so ello Cool J James Todd Smith
40:42 obviously made it as a rapper in the
40:44 late 80s he owned the rap industry he
40:48 was the best in the [ __ ] world when
40:50 he was on top of it soon as you know
40:53 grunge came and gangster rap took over
40:55 the 90s he he continued his music career
40:58 but he was smart he realized the jig was
41:02 up he wasn't going to go dark even
41:05 though he tried a couple times because
41:07 the funny thing about Cool J is that he
41:09 lives The Trews stick-up kid life in
41:13 Queens New York he saw a bunch of
41:15 horrible [ __ ] that no one should ever
41:16 see his family being attacked but the
41:18 shotguns and all kinds of stuff right I
41:20 mean he's read his book get his book and
41:23 read it it'll blow your mind how he has
41:25 still remained this sweet gentleman and
41:28 a brilliant human being at that the guy
41:30 like I say all the time he is as nice as
41:32 you think he is and he is brilliant he's
41:34 more brilliant than you could ever know
41:35 let me tell you if you think he just
41:39 memorizes his lyrics think again he
41:41 remembers probably everything he reads
41:44 scientific things not just whatever I
41:47 mean he he's amazing so I had a
41:53 privilege of working with him for a year
41:54 solid on a project called boom dizzle
41:57 you can look it up on YouTube I got to
42:01 design it draw it and engineer it and
42:04 it was cool but in meeting with this guy
42:09 right so I'm a huge fan he you know as I
42:12 said over and over and over again he
42:13 influenced me as a kid he had a song
42:15 called breakthrough on his album bigger
42:17 and Deffer when I came to California I
42:19 used the song break through my radio in
42:20 my car to galvanize me to prepare for
42:24 well pretty much what this episode is
42:25 all about it's basically the lyrics to
42:27 break through and you know part of it
42:32 was to build yourself up to be the most
42:33 amazing thing you can be and realize
42:35 that people will be envious of you and
42:36 try to knock you down that's really sort
42:39 of life right everyone's jealous 24/7 so
42:43 I'm having meetings with him on a
42:45 regular basis he comes to my north
42:48 office all the time
42:50 in Culver City now trying to have a
42:53 meeting with him is where you start to
42:55 realize his work regiment the brothers
42:58 up at like 4:30 in the morning to get to
43:01 work he's got his lines sent to him the
43:03 night before for his CSI or NCIS la show
43:07 now he's also you know writing new music
43:10 usually even though his albums are a
43:12 little slower now he's still preparing
43:13 new albums and he's also preparing
43:16 concert tours cuz it's just fun it keeps
43:18 him on his toes and it's money why not
43:19 go get it right he also hosts the
43:22 Grammys so there's that whole thing once
43:24 a year preparing for that but he will on
43:28 any particular day he'll go to the gym
43:30 really early he has to eat between his
43:36 work efforts and he eats very specific
43:39 foods to keep himself extremely healthy
43:42 technically speaking I looked him up
43:44 he's six feet tall but I tell you ever
43:46 meet the guy you'll swear to god he's
43:47 seven feet he's one of the biggest guys
43:49 physically and he's totally proportional
43:51 it's amazing but he's a monster he's a
43:54 Hulk it's tremendous right he's bigger
43:57 than he ever was during mama said knock
43:58 you out but he's got that chieftain gene
44:02 where he's a leader he's just an
44:04 absolute leader and he's a leader that
44:06 you could trust because he has a pure
44:07 heart and
44:10 he believes in God and he's God fearing
44:13 and it just makes him an amazing human
44:15 being well we would have to like let's
44:20 say we had a meeting scheduled like six
44:22 o'clock well you know shooting schedules
44:24 on television shows don't adhere to any
44:26 outside meeting you might have made to
44:28 some for someone so we would get there
44:30 all at six o'clock and we start getting
44:32 the calls and the text messages that the
44:34 shoots going a little longer so we're
44:35 gonna have to wait so here's the guy
44:37 he's been up since 4:30 in the morning
44:39 and he gets to me maybe like say seven
44:40 o'clock 7:30 he has some fruit with him
44:45 that he'll use that he'll be eating you
44:48 could tell is exhausted but he still has
44:50 energy to sit down and talk with me
44:52 about an entrepreneurial venture to
44:53 create a music studio online so people
44:55 can create music anywhere they are in
44:57 the world on one interface it worked
44:59 it's cool
45:00 probably a little bit ahead of its time
45:02 I just found the patents the other day
45:05 on my hard drive it we all have mutually
45:07 on this product it's really cool but now
45:10 here's the thing it was a year of this
45:13 over and over I'd meet him at his office
45:15 and we got a William or his agency to do
45:18 demos and he'd be in my place and just
45:23 seeing his regiment in a very discipline
45:27 way and seeing him work the gym into it
45:29 if you think you go to the gym and
45:32 workout chances are unless you're a
45:35 dedicated bodybuilder you go to the gym
45:38 in a completely different way that he
45:39 goes to the gym so when I saw that it
45:43 was just like wow this is very very
45:46 intense and I know very few people on
45:48 this planet including myself who could
45:51 probably do this year in and year out
45:54 that shows been on the air over half a
45:56 decade now right it's almost going
45:58 almost a decade now if it hasn't already
46:00 hit a decade over and over I'm sure it
46:03 gets a little bit easy I'm sure there's
46:05 a little bit of muscle memory in there
46:06 but any of you've watched the
46:07 documentaries on Johnny Carson and his
46:09 show is 30 years show he had on the air
46:12 think about it you have all these guests
46:14 every single day you barely get a time
46:17 get time off you got to learn all the
46:19 new questions it's all scripted it's
46:21 intense
46:23 and lump onto that the grammys lump onto
46:25 that doing music tours yes there are
46:27 months when he doesn't shoot but then he
46:29 goes and visits his family in New York
46:31 you know and it only has [ __ ]
46:34 breaking in his house at night which he
46:38 very judiciously took care of and you
46:42 have to maintain your sanity you have to
46:44 maintain your soul and he does it true
46:48 inspiration from top to bottom
46:51 you don't always meet your idols when
46:55 you were a kid and find out that they're
46:58 cool you sometimes you find out they're
47:00 pretty cranky people I've only had one
47:03 person in my entire life that was like
47:04 that I probably did a really bad job
47:07 introducing myself to him as soon as I
47:09 get away go see you later bye see you
47:11 laters we kept saying that to me I was
47:12 like okay I'm sorry sorry I walked up to
47:15 you with no one else around you and said
47:17 hi right but there's a very interesting
47:20 story he told me Cool J told me that I
47:22 think is valuable for you guys which is
47:24 when he's making his first album radio
47:28 because there was a point in the product
47:31 that we were designing and building that
47:32 we were up against some technical
47:34 hurdles and he was simply saying look if
47:36 we don't solve these problems someone
47:38 else is gonna do it and whoever solves
47:39 these problems takes it all right and
47:42 I'm looking at him up they can you know
47:45 it's bizarre that a musician and an
47:47 actor is telling me how to engineer
47:48 software but you know what the guy is
47:50 completely correct and because he's so
47:53 smart he's really seeing all the moving
47:55 parts
47:55 he's completely correct he was my mentor
47:58 in industry that he never worked in that
48:01 was awesome but he goes look when I was
48:04 making my first album he said you know I
48:05 got some recording time in a studio
48:07 downtown New York and he goes I was the
48:11 only one that went every single day that
48:12 I had the studio at my disposal I went
48:15 in there and I'm supposed to have my my
48:17 other musicians there with me the you
48:19 know the producers working with me and
48:21 they you know they're friends of his at
48:22 the time I believe and he said you know
48:24 they didn't always show up so I worked
48:27 really hard and I got that album done he
48:29 goes the amount of times i sat there by
48:30 myself creating my own beats hitting
48:33 record going in the booth doing my vocal
48:35 takes all
48:36 myself you know without the ability to
48:38 stop and start the recorder and just
48:40 going back and editing the album
48:41 together himself and he goes look it's
48:44 part of the part of the song break break
48:45 through he says look when I succeeded
48:47 all the guys that never showed up on a
48:50 consistent basis wanted my spoils
48:52 because the they had walked in the room
48:54 at one point time they did push a button
48:55 once and they wanted the alkylate of
48:58 having really slaved over the product so
49:03 you'll find that there are people that
49:05 will do that to you and you might also
49:09 find that they're like you they are you
49:11 you're the one that once all the prizes
49:13 for just sort of phoning it in well I
49:17 did my dance I did my dance you know I
49:19 got a fifty thousand likes on YouTube
49:22 shouldn't I be famous already answer no
49:27 not at all man one you got to replicate
49:31 that perfection every single time you do
49:32 whatever it is you do right I mean how
49:35 many of you would buy the second album
49:37 of your favorite artist if it sucked
49:39 would you just buy it because you're
49:41 like oh well I support this person so
49:44 I'm just gonna buy his or her album
49:45 because they made it a next album you
49:47 know maybe if they're of musical genius
49:49 like Prince who used to change his sound
49:52 every album and so you had to kind of
49:53 change your brain from Purple Rain to
49:56 around the world in the day to son of
49:58 the times it was totally different every
49:59 time he came up with al but you knew he
50:01 was a genius and so it was just a matter
50:03 of you figuring out the genius and that
50:05 particular album and luckily he would
50:08 stick a few songs that get on the radio
50:10 so it helped us adjust but that's his
50:12 brilliance very few people in the world
50:15 can do that right Jack Nicholson barely
50:18 ever changed his methodology of acting
50:20 his entire life from one flow of the
50:22 Cuckoo's Nest to you know was it wag the
50:25 dog wasn't even was getting that one too
50:26 but he is who he is right I don't think
50:31 he was in wag the dog that was De Niro
50:32 but anyway let me get you hip to
50:35 something else and this is something
50:37 that people take a long time to learn
50:40 when you're born your pristine right
50:43 your skin is smooth and your soul is
50:46 pure and you're just a product of God
50:50 as you go through life it makes you a
50:51 little cynical right you meet people
50:55 that lie and you meet people that take
50:56 advantage of you meet dumb people and
50:58 smart people dumb people take advantage
50:59 if you don't even know that they're
51:00 doing it right it's not that they're bad
51:02 people they just don't know I don't have
51:04 any empathy or sympathy because their
51:06 brain hasn't elevated to that level yet
51:07 or they lost it at some point when you
51:11 come out here and it's really anywhere
51:13 in your region that is like a Hollywood
51:17 you could be the one in a million that
51:18 has a great ride and you know sadly the
51:23 industries have been totally polluted by
51:24 perverts at this point so some of that
51:27 goes away with just that whole regimen
51:29 right but what were your options before
51:32 you moved away from your family to chase
51:34 this dream well you could be close to
51:37 your family wherever you do come from
51:38 you could get married you could have
51:40 some kids you can get a normal job maybe
51:44 your job is part of your dream maybe
51:45 your job is just to put food on the
51:47 table and your real dream is to raise
51:49 your family maybe like fishing maybe
51:52 like building drag race cars or whatever
51:56 it is you do but use all your money from
51:59 your jobs to go get these other things
52:01 but you have this close-knit family and
52:04 you have if you're born and raised in a
52:06 particular region and you were fortunate
52:08 enough not to move away move all over
52:10 the United States like I had in my life
52:12 you get to keep your friends your whole
52:14 life it's very powerful but what I see
52:19 is a lot of times when I go back to my
52:20 hometown which is a little tiny town in
52:22 Kansas I won't bump into people that
52:24 seem to be a little on the defensive
52:27 that they didn't come to California and
52:30 do something special and I'm sitting
52:33 there looking at him like you're crazy
52:36 you're crazy what you have is what most
52:39 people who have jumped into this machine
52:41 that is Hollywood of music are sort of
52:46 wishing they had never let go now the
52:48 only exceptions to the rule are those
52:50 people that got the scratch-off ticket
52:51 with the five million dollar prize right
52:54 and there's very few of those people in
52:55 the entire world if you think we have
52:57 7.5 billion
52:58 why don't you divide like two thousand
53:01 by 7.5 billion and that's the percentage
53:03 of people that
53:04 really get this kind of lifestyle so you
53:06 can't again go see my episode on lottery
53:09 lifestyle it's the idea that you're
53:11 gonna win the lottery ticket and be this
53:13 amazing special person the problem is
53:16 once you leave your home you get
53:19 yourself committed to sort of a public
53:22 exhibition of what you've done with your
53:23 life so some people come out here and
53:26 they have told their friends and family
53:29 where they are who may have expressed
53:32 some concern about their decision like
53:34 honey are you sure you want to go out
53:36 there man it's I've heard a lot of crazy
53:37 things and there are Weinstein's out
53:39 there and there's a lot of girls that go
53:42 out to become actresses and they become
53:44 porn stars so be very careful and they
53:47 you know they they push it back they say
53:49 screw you right and now they're out here
53:53 and they are committed to something but
53:57 they can't get to something because they
53:58 keep trying to shortcut their talents
53:59 maybe they don't really have the talent
54:01 I think they have maybe they're
54:02 tone-deaf but they want to be a singer
54:03 how many times have you seen American
54:05 Idol auditions where the kid comes in
54:07 butchers a song and they go back out
54:12 with their without their ticket to
54:13 continue on the show and the parents run
54:15 in the show in front of the judges ago
54:17 you don't know town if you could see it
54:19 right and all of us sit at home going
54:21 wow the kids tone-deaf and the mother
54:23 has no idea the father or whatever has
54:25 no idea how unskilled their child is
54:30 Simon Cowell gets a bunch of bad press
54:32 because he's the Meany right or at least
54:35 back in the day when he was on American
54:36 Idol right another big moment of truth
54:40 is that that guy is probably one of the
54:42 nicest managers / agents you could ever
54:45 talk to he's brutally honest about what
54:48 it is and he does it with a fairly soft
54:50 tone I don't think that's your thing
54:52 even Randy will say it or back in the
54:53 day you know I do don't think this is
54:55 your thing man super nice super nice
54:58 what you really run into here is
55:01 statements like don't ever [ __ ] call
55:04 me again you're absolutely talentless if
55:09 I ever see you again you know I'm gonna
55:11 put you on a list and you'll never be
55:12 able to walk in front of another human
55:13 being but if nothing else don't [ __ ]
55:15 with me you're absolutely worthless
55:17 that's the kind of stuff I've heard
55:19 people have to endure out here and so
55:22 you don't want to get that kind of
55:23 statement at your soul because you might
55:26 believe it if you do you're gonna have
55:29 to nut up and say okay geez they're
55:31 right I don't need to quit necessarily
55:35 if I want to keep going to the next
55:36 level I'm gonna have to get in front of
55:37 that mirror and get really serious I'm
55:39 gonna have to find people that will tell
55:40 me I suck and keep working on it until
55:42 they tell me I'm okay
55:43 plenty of people have done it but you
55:46 got to have that tenaciousness and that
55:49 really thick skin right to endear that
55:53 sort of feedback and continue going but
55:57 now here's sort of a light at the end of
55:58 the tunnel we have thousands of people
56:03 behind the camera we have thousands of
56:05 people in the in the producing room
56:07 right in the mixing room who started off
56:10 their life saying I want to be the
56:13 person in front of the camera I want to
56:14 be the person on the stage and they did
56:16 it and some of our extremely talented
56:18 but they don't have the look they're fat
56:19 you know they're not very attractive and
56:21 so and they're unwilling to lose weight
56:23 and whatever they get the right genetics
56:25 that the public thinks is attractive on
56:27 stage believe me there's been some
56:30 questionably looking people that became
56:32 extremely famous and they're extremely
56:34 famous to the day so you should almost
56:36 not listen to any type of attraction
56:37 issue but they become part of the
56:42 production they become a director of
56:44 photography they become some sort of
56:47 editor they they participate in the art
56:49 on the more complex side which is really
56:52 bringing it all together to make it the
56:53 final product they become record
56:55 producers that become sound engineers
56:56 yeah they wanted to be the person on
56:58 stage but now they sitting there going
57:00 wow I get to go home to my bed every
57:03 single night see my kid
57:04 see my wife my husband whatever and I
57:07 don't have to get on that goddamn tour
57:08 bus I don't have to use cocaine because
57:12 I don't need it and I get to get the
57:16 Grammy to when this music gets a Grammy
57:19 from LL Cool J where you go off to the
57:21 Academy Awards and you get your Academy
57:23 Award because you're a sound engineer
57:26 maybe you're a writer there's all kinds
57:28 of writers there's the writers that
57:30 write the original script
57:31 there's rewriters to edit the script
57:32 there's people that just write dialogue
57:33 for scripts there's a million different
57:36 jobs behind the scenes that you can get
57:38 into and you shouldn't cut those short
57:41 because I've talked to people that say
57:42 oh I refuse to be a part of anything
57:45 less than the very top okay that's a
57:48 nice goal
57:50 you better be one hell of a person to be
57:53 knocking JJ Abrams out of his director
57:55 chair right I don't agree with
57:57 everything he's ever made but for what
57:58 he's responsible for I think he does a
58:00 fairly good job
58:01 right so now who would listen to this
58:03 episode right some of you are actually
58:06 pondering this sort of lifestyle and so
58:08 you listen to the whole thing some of
58:10 you just listen because you're fans of
58:12 the show and it's just interesting to
58:13 listen to in your car or wherever you
58:15 are right this sort of lesson that I
58:22 have law I've learned all this from
58:23 other people of course right is very
58:28 valuable if you're living what what most
58:30 people call a normal life I've had
58:34 friends of mine that wanted to be a part
58:35 of this lifestyle that I'm talking about
58:37 they visited Los Angeles
58:39 some of them come out here came out here
58:40 to live for a little while they saw the
58:42 Machine they went behind the curtain
58:45 they met the wizard and they were like I
58:48 don't want to have anything to do with
58:49 this I am fortunate that wherever I am
58:53 from is a loving wonderful place and
58:55 I've got a great family or I've got good
58:57 friends and I am going to go back to
58:59 where I came from and now when I'm there
59:01 and I'm living that quote-unquote normal
59:03 life I know that I win more every single
59:07 day than any of these guys that have the
59:10 the platinum albums or all the golden
59:12 statues at home right I got my first
59:16 celebrity client I think I was about 27
59:19 years old and she's a lead singer of a
59:24 trio band an R&B trio band back in the
59:27 day
59:27 SuperDuper famous I listened to her
59:29 music all the time and a buddy of mine
59:31 knew her and they said you got to talk
59:32 to mark because he's gonna handle this
59:33 for you and I drove to her house it was
59:37 in the Bay Area and it was just a nice
59:39 little house and a track track home
59:41 community and I go inside
59:44 and you know I'm sitting with her and
59:46 you know to my writer the Grammys to my
59:48 right is all the music MTV Music Awards
59:51 well by the way those things are super
59:52 heavy and she no she's this gorgeous
59:56 person she's tremendously tells she's
59:58 the lead lead singer in this band right
60:01 and she had a roommate and she had a
60:07 roommate because he needed it
60:09 financially right and she was smart
60:13 she's like look I could spend all my
60:14 savings on that other room but why not
60:17 get a roommate so I can save my money
60:19 because this train is gonna int all
60:21 right and this band was ultra famous
60:24 okay but I would say by this was 1997-98
60:30 somewhere in there by 2005 I don't think
60:35 they've released another song they're
60:38 done and they've been done for almost 15
60:40 years don't know what she does now I
60:43 hope she nest-egg enough away that she
60:45 doesn't have any issues I don't know
60:47 she's married I don't know anything
60:48 about her anymore
60:50 she was a soft kind soul she had a hell
60:55 of a manager let me tell you a wicked
60:57 old lady the the sickness that I see
61:01 that happens in this world and it
61:04 doesn't always have to do with Fame okay
61:05 or some sort of celebrity career is that
61:08 people get convinced that what they have
61:09 is not good it's not sufficient and so
61:15 they will convince themselves and it's
61:17 usually about watching television or
61:19 looking at the internet too much they'll
61:20 convince themselves that what they have
61:21 which is cherished by all the people
61:24 that have this other thing isn't any
61:26 good and there's nothing worse than
61:29 someone telling you that you're not
61:30 amazing that you don't have something
61:33 amazing at your disposal it's horrible
61:35 you don't deserve someone to tell you
61:37 that you know and if all these
61:40 celebrities lives were so wonderful then
61:43 how could TMZ make any money they have
61:46 the same problems with their kids they
61:47 have the same problem with their money
61:48 they have the same problem with their
61:50 spouses and honestly let's say someone
61:56 becomes some sort
61:57 of worker in a small town you put shoes
62:01 on the citizens of the town we used to
62:04 have this shoe store downtown and it was
62:07 the parents owned it and formed it and I
62:09 saw the son worked there from his
62:12 teenage years all the way into his
62:14 retirement they showed they shut the
62:15 police down because I think Walmart
62:16 destroyed him at one point but I
62:18 remember taking my daughter there
62:19 because it was a famous place in town I
62:20 got her some shoes
62:21 I remember watching this guy put the
62:23 shoes on my daughter and there's this
62:25 look on his face like I can't believe
62:27 I'm in my forty's putting shoes on
62:29 children and remember Here I am in LA
62:33 and I'm in the Bay Area and I've had you
62:35 know lots of fortunate things happen to
62:37 me too I'm saying oh look at him going
62:38 man I would switch places with you at
62:40 two seconds you got to live in your
62:42 hometown your whole life you got to own
62:44 a business so you didn't have to have a
62:47 boss that told you what to do
62:50 unfortunately again the big corporation
62:53 Walmart destroyed them which is
62:55 something we have to fix in this country
62:56 but he had it all and he thought he
63:00 didn't have anything I could just see it
63:01 in his face you know I mean you
63:03 shouldn't have goals and strive for
63:05 things
63:05 no but this grass is greener thing man
63:10 it happens all the time in relationships
63:12 right people are married to amazing
63:15 people but you know they look around the
63:18 world and especially the internet
63:20 Facebook and all this other stuff if it
63:22 what's Facebook Facebook is the game of
63:23 pretending to have a life better than
63:24 you have and they get convinced and then
63:28 they start meandering around now maybe
63:31 you need to change partners I don't know
63:33 I'm not judging here but a lot of times
63:36 you don't need to but you're convinced
63:38 that you do and that's gonna be a
63:41 decision you have to make for yourself
63:42 right anyway I hope this was valuable
63:44 for you guys thank you feel me if you
