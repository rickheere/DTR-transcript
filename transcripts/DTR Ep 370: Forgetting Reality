00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen you're gonna get a daytime
00:38 episode because it is warm out ish it's
00:42 gonna be losing its heat here so I'll
00:44 put my jacket on it's not to go and
00:45 switch out so today I want to talk about
00:49 forgetting reality and I am
00:53 intentionally coming up with a slightly
00:55 provocative title on this because I
00:59 slipped up on this theory in a previous
01:01 episode and it's changed my perspective
01:06 of aging a little bit and of how to
01:11 enjoy life to the very fullest and to
01:14 perhaps slow down this illusion that
01:16 life gets faster as you get older and
01:19 then we're gonna on the fly explore
01:21 perhaps how to do this how to inhibit
01:25 this problem here's the theory but I
01:29 came up with during recording a show
01:31 that seems utterly profound the more I
01:34 think about it and I've shared it with
01:36 some friends of mine who were older and
01:38 everyone's sort of going wow that makes
01:41 complete sense
01:43 so I dig this show so I take this
01:45 process of digging in the mind again the
01:49 universe has all the answers we have to
01:51 write the right query back to the
01:53 universe to get back results such that
01:55 we can continue this enlightenment
01:57 process you know attempting to enhance
02:01 ourselves so the theory I rift I think I
02:06 might have been on the aging episode
02:07 which is this when you're young time is
02:12 very meticulous tedious and you see and
02:16 remember virtually every second every
02:18 minute every hour of your life when
02:22 you're young when you get older you
02:26 can't even remember where the years went
02:27 10 years will pass and you're like wow
02:30 that was nothing now there's probably a
02:35 little bit of perspective on time that
02:37 because we have lived 10 years multiple
02:40 times when you get to 40 you've done it
02:41 four times that perhaps the next one is
02:44 going to be a little
02:46 quicker but I'm gonna here to tell you I
02:48 don't think that's the case anymore I
02:51 think it's a but it's a biological
02:53 mental thing that's occurring here that
02:56 makes it seem like it's going faster and
02:58 it has to do with forgetting reality
03:02 when you look back on being a kid and
03:05 some of us have you know great memories
03:09 on that you can remember being 5 6 7 8 9
03:12 10
03:13 you remember going to school I remember
03:14 your teachers you remember your friends
03:16 remember walking to school remember
03:18 coming home every single day what you
03:19 did how you played when you were bored
03:22 when you were excited all those things
03:24 and then you can't seem to do it as you
03:26 get older you have selected pockets over
03:29 the course of ten years I think our
03:33 brain is erasing memories of the mundane
03:38 part of this again is kicked off by the
03:40 west-world
03:43 analogy which is that these hosts were
03:46 in loops and then you find out that one
03:49 of the accusations towards humanity in
03:51 that in that first season is that people
03:54 believe that they have more elaborate
03:59 loops but they don't they actually have
04:01 tighter more boring loops and it's not
04:03 until they come into the park of
04:05 Westworld
04:06 this fictional place that they realize
04:08 that they live some loop so they never
04:10 had before maybe they don't even do a
04:11 loop but they are using other hosts who
04:15 are in loops to facilitate a treasure
04:16 hunt finding a bad guy having a shootout
04:18 whatever we know that when we drive to
04:21 work every single day if you have the
04:23 same job for any number of years you
04:26 will get to a point where you forget the
04:30 trip this started happening to me
04:32 happening to me when I was probably 16 I
04:34 got my first job across town
04:37 it was like I had two jobs in the same
04:40 parking lot
04:41 clear on the other side of town which is
04:42 a whole know three miles maybe and I
04:47 would get to work and it's when someone
04:49 told me that whole analogy that people
04:50 forget going through traffic lights and
04:53 you'll get to your destination you
04:55 realize oh my god did I even go through
04:56 green lights that I go through red
04:58 lights I can't even remember
04:59 when someone says would you eat for
05:01 breakfast you know like what the hell
05:04 did I eat for breakfast and it's only
05:05 like eight o'clock at night and you
05:06 can't remember if you had breakfast this
05:10 starts happening fairly early in our
05:11 lives and I think it's a sheer defense
05:15 mechanism of our consciousness going why
05:18 do you want to remember all that crap do
05:21 you really want to remember all that
05:22 crap do you want to remember every time
05:23 you bathe every time you shower every
05:27 time you put your clothes on let me go
05:28 the restroom yeah
05:30 those are just stupid loops you do but
05:34 have no effect on you and so I'm gonna
05:38 just you know throw them out why hold on
05:40 to them it's just like holding onto
05:43 every spam email that you've ever had in
05:45 your life why it has no value once you
05:48 look at it and go this is not something
05:50 I solicited they're trying to sell me
05:52 some crap I don't want poof it's gone so
05:56 the reason why I'm calling this episode
05:58 for getting reality is that that's what
06:00 I think the brain is doing and we have
06:05 to explore why why we think that might
06:07 be occurring but as you get older your
06:10 routines get more looped you're you're
06:13 in it's not necessarily a horrible thing
06:16 but it's something I think we should
06:18 know about ourselves neurologically
06:21 mentally spiritually such that we can
06:25 choose whether or not we want to keep
06:27 that routine in our life do you want to
06:31 remember more of your life do you want
06:32 to get more out of a 10 year lifespan I
06:36 mean not like you're gonna die at the 10
06:38 years but I'm just saying for each
06:40 decade that you're living and of course
06:42 we monetize our excuse me we enumerate
06:45 our life's where it's you know in my
06:47 thirties I'm in the 40 mm it's just some
06:50 arbitrary weird thing that we do to
06:51 ourselves and because of neuropeptides
06:53 we have to be very careful we perceive
06:58 ourselves and our neural peptides kick
07:00 into action and create the body the
07:03 physical aging that you believe that you
07:05 are I can prove it I can prove it prove
07:10 it prove it when I went back to my high
07:12 school reunion again
07:13 just recently my 30th couple years ago
07:17 everybody who is like slapping their
07:20 belly and Jana I'm you know you know
07:22 it's like they're the same age as me me
07:23 plus or minus a year my god II looked 10
07:27 years older than me easily and everyone
07:30 in the room that looked really young and
07:31 good good skin managed to keep their
07:35 weight down you know they're more you
07:38 know the world a little bit thicker but
07:40 not much if we wanted washboard abs we
07:44 could probably end up exercising for
07:46 about six months and look better than we
07:47 did at 18 not these other people who
07:50 keep rattling on about how old they are
07:53 some of the some of the women will marry
07:58 guys that are like 10 years older than
08:00 them which is fine but the guys are
08:04 physically older and they are in that
08:07 camp of being with older people and so
08:11 they start aging up to that that group
08:14 of friends because the neuropeptides are
08:16 all different the frequency is different
08:19 it's older slower more set in its ways
08:23 the loops are super tight and maybe
08:26 maybe boring maybe not maybe the
08:29 tightest loop out there that someone has
08:32 in whatever part of the world they are
08:34 is the like it's like brainstorm and the
08:37 guy you've de loop the orgasm on the
08:39 tape now the I think there are other
08:42 things that contribute to this and I
08:45 think it all is based on the same
08:47 principle loops loops loops let's say
08:51 you're a very busy person you live a
08:54 remarkable life you do something where
08:59 you create something amazing I mean
09:00 again I always lean back to the stuff
09:02 that I see in my world so I've got
09:05 buddies in mind you do visual effects
09:07 and make films and that the dozen times
09:09 I'm involved with the project sometimes
09:11 I'm not so they might say well geez for
09:14 three years I made Battlestar Galactica
09:17 then I popped out and I made this movie
09:18 that movie this movie and then I got
09:20 back on this Apple commercial and I did
09:22 just they have this for 10 years they've
09:25 gotten damn near
09:26 you know a statue for every year they've
09:29 been in the business and their IMDB just
09:31 continually explodes but they will still
09:34 have the problem where they get to the
09:35 end of ten years and I'll have
09:36 conversations with them and we have this
09:38 epiphany that the ten years just flew by
09:41 now am i saying it's wrong that years
09:45 fly by not at all you would be the only
09:49 one to to deduce and make the decision
09:53 as to whether or not you think life is
09:54 going by too quickly it is a fact that
09:58 as we do get older our faculties or
10:00 physical instrumentalities do tend to
10:02 break down but a lot of times if you eat
10:09 healthy and you get good sleep and you
10:11 don't stress too much you can prolong
10:14 that period for a very long time I want
10:18 to give you a little story I told it
10:22 only one time before so that you can
10:24 perceive age a little bit differently I
10:26 was in a special math class and and it
10:32 was held inside a machine shop because
10:35 the machine shop teacher was by all
10:38 stretch of the imagination a complete
10:40 genius he was the guy that eventually
10:41 rigidly built the guitar pickup and had
10:44 it ripped off from him and the Les Paul
10:46 came around goes look at me
10:48 this guy was taught by the military had
10:50 to build dirty bombs back in the
10:53 post-world War two days so he was a he
10:58 was a physicist as well so the guy's a
11:00 genius
11:00 I just tell you that because the
11:02 integrity of the comment that and his
11:05 family is involved I think a little bit
11:08 with the event that took place so we're
11:09 there and the machine shop door was open
11:13 and the machine shops full of all kinds
11:16 of stuff on the other side's wood it's
11:18 got a big you know firewall between it
11:19 in this big building we had an art was
11:22 on the other floors up above but this
11:24 old guy comes in and backs to TRUCKING
11:27 old Ford truck and he is lifting these
11:31 giant pieces of steel that had been
11:34 worked into the back of his truck he's
11:37 an old guy he's putting it all in there
11:40 and then he some of the guys the the
11:44 class was actually full of a couple farm
11:46 boys that are used to baling hay you
11:49 know big old hook and you know grab him
11:51 75 pound you know bales of hay and
11:53 putting in the back of truck doing 100
11:55 you know 50 a day kind of thing these
11:57 big big dudes and they were struggling
11:59 to put this crap in the back of the
12:01 truck well this old man's just like one
12:02 arm in this [ __ ] back there just boom
12:04 boom boom he's pretty big guy he's
12:06 probably at 6 to 264 somewhere in that
12:08 room sold dude pushes up the truck back
12:12 starts his truck takes off and he came
12:16 in and he looks at the teacher and he's
12:18 like it was just my stuff right Harry
12:19 and he's like yeah yeah that's your
12:20 stuff and the guy did all this stuff and
12:22 we you know some guys jumped up to help
12:23 him he was out in like five minutes
12:27 and so we all sat Dennis start the class
12:30 again and my buddy who was one of guys
12:33 had jumped up to help he goes who was
12:35 that guy he goes and the teacher goes
12:39 that's my dad now our teacher was
12:42 definitely in his late 50s at least this
12:46 would have been in the mid 80s
12:48 being sure to find out how old that guy
12:50 was because that's my dad and a the dude
12:53 goes well how old is he he's 97 the old
12:58 class is like what one he's driving his
13:02 own truck the guy I mean he looked older
13:05 but I mean I don't know he had silver
13:07 hair but I think we probably would have
13:10 estimated I don't know late 60s early
13:13 70s something like that and this guy was
13:16 a ghullam he was built out of Steel like
13:18 he could just grab steel and just hurl
13:21 it in the back of his truck and he was
13:22 grabbing the bigger pieces and so
13:26 everyone's just like looking at each
13:28 other because we're young kids you know
13:30 we're all in our teens from probably 15
13:32 to 18 somewhere in that room in that
13:34 room and it just kind of came and went
13:37 and he's like yeah yeah he's really you
13:39 know he just never stops he's still
13:40 really strong his eyes work he's driving
13:44 a truck it was ridiculous now the only
13:48 thing I could assume is that we heard
13:50 the age a little bit wrong but I don't
13:52 give a crap but this
13:53 I was 20 years younger I don't care if
13:55 he was 77 years old
13:56 what he did was utterly phenomenal but
13:58 I'm pretty sure we got it right
13:59 especially based on the age of our
14:01 teacher the reason why I tell you that
14:05 story is that the perception of age is
14:07 such a powerful mechanism when it does
14:09 come to your neuropeptides if you want
14:10 to know a lot about neuropeptides go
14:12 watch the movie what the bleep do we
14:14 know that's what it's called because
14:16 they wouldn't use the f-bomb or whatever
14:18 but they have a bunch of neural we have
14:21 a bunch of physicists quantum physics
14:23 people neurologists and they talk about
14:25 this and how it works and it will change
14:27 you a little bit I tell you that story
14:30 one just parte entertainment but the
14:34 other part is I think you know living in
14:37 the big city depending on where you live
14:39 life can be harder than the little
14:42 country town I grew up in that this old
14:43 guy grew up in and so you may get to a
14:47 point and nobody wants to ever admit
14:49 this this is crazy
14:51 I've definitely met people like this in
14:54 my lifetime and I think even at a
14:56 younger age this will ping your heart
14:58 every once in a while when things get
15:00 really tough financially tough
15:03 relationship to parenting tough job
15:06 tough whatever you'll you'll hear that
15:11 old analogy life's a [ __ ] and then you
15:13 die and the big thing is is that if you
15:17 do die all this pain goes away your
15:20 taxes go away all the burden of
15:22 existence goes away and so some people
15:24 secretly romantically fall in love with
15:26 dying and I don't personally have that
15:31 just so you know I've definitely felt
15:34 the ping in my lifetime I'm like that is
15:35 true yeah if I do die well whatever you
15:37 know I did my best while I was here you
15:39 know work really hard and I treated
15:41 every day like it was my last and did it
15:43 to that but I have friends in Hollywood
15:44 who have accomplished everything they
15:49 set out to accomplish and that must be a
15:51 really strange feeling I almost feel
15:54 sorry for them okay but they will talk
15:57 about how they don't want to live very
15:59 much longer than they already have lived
16:01 like they'll be in their late 60's and
16:04 they'll be just talking about oh well
16:05 you know I don't
16:06 to live that long or we'll talk about a
16:08 mutual friend who's older who's
16:10 suffering health problems and they'll
16:11 say why does that person want to live I
16:13 don't understand died already you know
16:15 not like they want them to die but it's
16:17 just like you've done everything you're
16:19 amazing now just stop trying to live
16:21 stop trying to get through all your you
16:23 know your illnesses and stuff like that
16:24 and you know I politely listen and
16:29 what's interesting is one of my friends
16:33 has a child and he's probably in his
16:36 late 60s and his child has not had a
16:38 child yet and so that that unbelievable
16:42 moment of being a grandparent hasn't
16:44 occurred yet and so he's talking about
16:47 only wanting to live I don't know maybe
16:51 seven more years or something like that
16:52 or even less and you absolutely looking
16:56 at the guy like coming from a small town
16:58 I'm like you know you have no clue what
17:00 you're talking about because as soon as
17:01 you see your grandchild your whole
17:06 commitment to life will reinforce
17:07 reinvent and you will not have such a
17:11 lazy Fair opinion of death you just
17:15 won't unless he gets mentally ill
17:18 himself for some other reason you know
17:21 and the this has come up a few times in
17:24 the comments on YouTube so I think I'll
17:26 throw it back into this episode and I
17:28 mentioned because I mentioned something
17:30 about Wade and James in the episode two
17:34 of the net never land thing leaving
17:37 Neverland and I basically put out the
17:40 caution you know gentlemen you better be
17:42 telling the truth because I've been on
17:44 the edge of life and it's if you like
17:48 there's consequences on the other side
17:50 there there are what you know I don't
17:52 again I don't believe in hell and
17:54 brimstone or a Satan or anything like
17:56 that I just think that a scarlet letter
18:00 is a pretty bad thing to create for
18:04 yourself I think we create our own
18:05 hell's I absolutely do
18:06 and so you know I when I was 23 it was
18:13 23 years old got in a relationship it
18:16 was going really south I was finding out
18:18 that I got dumped for an
18:20 I didn't have anything to do with and
18:22 the girl was really embarrassed when she
18:23 realized that she had miscalculated her
18:26 big epiphany as to why she should leave
18:28 me it was funny and then she ended up
18:29 trying to come back to me right after I
18:31 found the mother of my kid you know so
18:33 it was like sorry can't can't go back
18:35 you know I got this really amazing woman
18:38 and she wasn't pregnant yet but I just
18:40 couldn't go backwards right but before
18:43 all that took place I tried to drink
18:46 sleeping pills it was hilarious it was
18:48 like it's a comedy in me doing this okay
18:50 but the one thing that was very serious
18:52 was that I attempted to drink this it
18:54 was gross I poured it all out I was
18:56 laughing my ass off but then I started
18:57 getting really tired because I did go up
18:59 quite a bit of this down not enough to
19:01 puke but I'm sitting on the edge of my
19:03 bed in a studio apartment which Ifrit if
19:06 you haven't been in one of those it's a
19:07 20 by 20 box what they built in the the
19:10 bathroom the kitchen and the closet all
19:13 into one side and the rest is just an
19:16 open room you just do it whatever you
19:17 want
19:18 so I'm sitting on the edge of the bed
19:20 and I'm probably three feet from a
19:21 sliding glass door over here to my left
19:23 okay and I didn't go to work that day I
19:26 just said [ __ ] I'm not going to work
19:28 and I had a pretty nice brand new carpet
19:30 in the room and so if I moved around I
19:33 got those carpet fibers you know kind of
19:34 floating in the sunlight and you know it
19:41 could have been a hallucination induced
19:43 by this stuff I drink I took one gulp
19:46 with this stuff I put blue pills and
19:48 orange juice and it turn green so that
19:50 was the funny part first funny part but
19:53 it's all got the bitters in it you know
19:54 so when I drink it it was just like this
19:56 was gross and then I was realizing how
19:58 stupid I was
20:00 so I'm sitting on the edge of the bed
20:02 like right here on my side and I
20:06 remember just staring off at the ground
20:08 as I felt myself started getting really
20:09 tired in it which I started making phone
20:11 calls because I didn't want to fall
20:12 asleep just in case right I would have
20:14 been fine probably slept its best sleep
20:16 in my life but anyway I'm looking at the
20:19 floor and the floor vanishes man it
20:22 falls just like a Time Bandits Act three
20:26 moment where it's like a forever pit to
20:28 nowhere but not only did it fall all the
20:33 little fibers in the
20:34 the air went down with it like a vacuum
20:36 just poof and the side of my bed you
20:40 know was barely visible cuz it's right
20:41 on my perspective line of my eyeballs
20:43 but I am looking down into this pit and
20:45 the pit talked to me if you will
20:49 something was talking to me and it said
20:53 if you do this and succeed like it's
20:59 really the tents would be if you do this
21:01 again and you succeed this is where
21:03 you're gonna go and it was nothing it
21:08 was a nothingness and it was so you know
21:13 it's one of these weird situations where
21:15 if I had to describe with words what
21:19 this image meant to me I'd be talking
21:21 all day and still probably you know
21:24 atrociously paraphrase the moment but I
21:29 look down in that pit and it was like it
21:33 basically said to me we have worked so
21:35 hard to give you this life you have no
21:39 idea and you for you to piss it away
21:42 because of some relationship thing which
21:45 is the trials and tribulations we've
21:46 designed this world you have this is
21:49 what you're supposed to go through in
21:51 order to be a stronger in your next
21:52 relationship etc etc and life having a
21:55 thick skin right and so at that point it
21:59 was full closure full closure on that
22:03 event you're surely will never do that
22:07 okay you know the only exception would
22:10 be I'm vegetable and I get a split
22:15 second to communicate to everybody there
22:16 I'm not thinking anymore you know pull
22:18 the plug or whatever but even that I'm
22:20 not even sure I give a [ __ ] about that
22:21 just yeah just I'll be moon pie in
22:25 rollerball 1975 yeah just make sure I
22:29 don't have any pain in me I'd only be
22:30 sitting there and some torturous pain
22:32 and not be able to tell anybody about it
22:34 let's check my check my brain waves or
22:36 whatever I mean if nothing's happening
22:39 in my brain then nothing's happening and
22:41 you can do whatever you want but I won't
22:44 intentionally do it
22:45 so I mentioned that
22:48 it's because if if the antithesis of
22:50 your intent is to appreciate life to get
22:54 as much out of is that out of life as
22:56 you possibly can then maybe we have
23:01 options maybe we have options with our
23:05 loops
23:06 it's mr. crow flies by she I chased him
23:11 off he was the omen of death and I got
23:12 rid of him
23:13 he said screw this guy he wants to live
23:16 so when do these really tight loops
23:18 occur well like I said there's little
23:22 ones that start the second you start
23:23 driving for sure and there's probably
23:26 even microscopic ones when you're a
23:28 little little kid and your parents are
23:30 taking you to school and taking you home
23:31 and all that kind of stuff maybe even
23:33 class seems a little boring every once
23:35 in a while so you don't remember all
23:36 that but your 20s is at least that
23:40 traditionally used to be when you got a
23:41 job and you started kicking ass and
23:44 taking names but by your 30s I think
23:48 that whatever decisions you made in your
23:50 20s start to really solidify don't they
23:54 you've picked a place to live unless
23:56 you're in the military or something you
23:58 picked a place to live and that's gonna
24:00 be your house it's gonna be your
24:01 neighborhood that's gonna be your
24:02 friends these are the restaurants and
24:04 the grocery stores you're gonna go to
24:06 for entertainment maybe you live by a
24:08 lake a beach amusement park maybe all
24:10 the above and I think for me it because
24:14 my neighbors like I said in many
24:16 episodes they go out and they party
24:18 together if big families slightly
24:21 younger situation and so I look at that
24:25 and I'm thinking man they really do
24:27 enjoy themselves but they do tend to do
24:30 the same thing over and over and over
24:32 and maybe it's that damn good but what
24:35 conversation do we have where we sit
24:37 with each other and say is the loop good
24:41 is the loop the one we want because if
24:45 the answer comes back yes well thumbs up
24:48 man total success total success with
24:51 life and it could be simply that easy
24:53 but now wouldn't it be nice to get a
24:55 report card in the middle of life a plus
24:58 there you go
24:59 you're doing
25:00 keep going yes the more you repeat that
25:03 loop the less you're gonna remember and
25:05 the faster life will seem that it's
25:07 transpiring but you can always go back
25:09 to your report card and say but I am
25:11 doing what I want to do I love my life I
25:13 love myself love my family my friends
25:15 etc etc you're good to go
25:18 if you're in that state my assumption is
25:21 maybe watching these types of videos is
25:24 not something you're prone to do in the
25:25 first place
25:26 who knows maybe deep thoughts is one of
25:29 your loops definitely one of mine well
25:34 let's say that you you're content
25:37 but you're not necessarily thrilled
25:39 you're more in a neutral wave of
25:44 existence and you want it to be a little
25:47 bit more intense
25:48 maybe time is flying by and you're not
25:51 satisfied with it you can't put it into
25:53 words you're not sure if I'm my loop
25:56 Theory's correct what you're like yeah
25:57 you know what last 10 years just shot by
26:00 and I don't really have anything to to
26:04 put my finger on like it was 10 years
26:07 and thing is you only get older so might
26:11 you know my first regiment for you would
26:13 be to eat healthy clean up your life all
26:15 that good stuff so you slow down you're
26:16 aging and you definitely routinely kill
26:19 cancer in your body you know take your
26:20 vitamin C every single day at least a
26:22 thousand milligrams of time-release C I
26:24 take Solara they could be 17 everyone
26:28 some long just watch what you eat but
26:33 maybe a little bit of change in your
26:35 life and this is gonna be change that
26:38 you determine so don't get freaked out
26:39 I think humanity the fears change
26:43 because change has been responsible for
26:45 all cataclysms in human history oh we're
26:49 running the government this way we've
26:51 been doing it for 2,000 years and we're
26:53 all happy and don't you want something
26:55 else and someone goes yeah well yeah
26:57 what should we do oh I was thinking
26:59 about this thing called a dictatorship
27:01 or a monarchy or despotism made up
27:04 whatever and then you mess it up oh my
27:09 God we're all starving to death now and
27:11 who's this guy with the whip on my back
27:13 am I in Chains and why am i building
27:15 this palace and all that kind of stuff
27:18 why do we have money again what's the
27:20 stuff the money I got to work for this
27:22 stuff just to do what I used to just do
27:24 I used to get water for everybody but
27:27 now I'm supposed to charge money I gotta
27:29 charge money because this other jerk
27:30 that used to give me food is now in
27:32 exchange for water is now wanting this
27:34 paper thing that's why we have fear
27:38 about changing but if you're determining
27:43 your change and you plan it that's the
27:44 cool thing planning is almost again a
27:47 dirty word in this world to premeditate
27:49 your success it's like what are you
27:51 crazy just you know live off-the-cuff go
27:54 out there and just do a bunch of crazy
27:55 stuff and hey there are times for that
27:58 as well especially when you're young but
28:00 if you have the pocket in life maybe
28:02 your kids just get out of college and
28:04 they're starting to get their career so
28:05 they're good you'd probably don't want
28:06 to do anything that's life-threatening
28:08 because you should probably stick around
28:10 for your kids they're gonna need your
28:12 guidance as life progresses right
28:15 what if you built a plan and it's a
28:19 pretty good plan because you made it and
28:20 you're willing to fall down and get back
28:24 up and fall down and get back on not
28:27 about existence you're gonna learn every
28:29 single time you fail and then you're
28:32 gonna fail a lot less and a lot less but
28:35 if you plan and plan and plan that
28:39 failure rate will be as minimal as it
28:41 can be and I guess to stay with the
28:46 theme of the episode what I'm talking
28:48 about and I am just getting this
28:49 Epiphany myself so I have only recently
28:53 kind of come to grips with this and I'm
28:55 trying to take inventory in my life to
28:57 see if I want to do any of this myself
28:58 so I'm in the same camp as you which is
29:03 breaking the loops break in the loops
29:07 for me I used to try to do something
29:11 amazing every year of my life something
29:14 that was like what a filmmaker might say
29:17 is making a film every year maybe a
29:20 musician might say making an album every
29:22 year and so they have this you know this
29:26 in
29:26 possible thing that they they got
29:28 through they designed an impossible
29:30 thing like writing a film and getting it
29:31 made is damn near an impossible thing to
29:34 do it is getting an album made where a
29:38 record company is gonna buy it also very
29:42 very tough but you can do it everybody
29:46 can get it done that I ever think I'd
29:50 make over you know I'm at 400 episodes
29:52 now if you count the special reports and
29:55 probably four or fifty for the ones I've
29:57 had to throw away or a loss for
30:00 technical reasons before they did it a
30:04 hundred and thirty mkultra radio shows
30:08 do you think I ever thought that was
30:10 possible or I'd ever hang on for that
30:11 long no way I never thought that would
30:15 happen yet the show has a plan I have a
30:20 plan for the show I plan the episodes as
30:24 I speak to you guys I am planning ahead
30:26 five ten minutes of what I'm gonna say
30:30 you know there's a it's funny I think
30:32 this show will end at some point you'll
30:36 be able to go back and piece things
30:37 together like a little da Vinci Code
30:39 it's a bit like seventeen in this show
30:41 believe it or not any time I'm repeating
30:44 myself I'm on a subplot just so you know
30:47 one of the one of the really risky areas
30:53 of social interaction is the notion that
30:56 we want other people to live through
30:59 something or experience something that
31:01 we have recently experienced and you
31:05 know I just recently mentioned this but
31:06 it's sort of like again if someone takes
31:09 some medicine and they get better
31:12 well you want everyone to take that
31:14 medicine if they get that particular
31:15 sickness to get better when I finally
31:17 realized that vitamin C stabilized my
31:20 entire health regimen these two massive
31:24 one-month colds I used to get every
31:25 single year never happened anymore am I
31:30 get one for a week maybe and every
31:33 single time I get a cold today it's
31:36 because I have become
31:38 complicit or or I'm sorry I've taken for
31:42 granted my health and I will forget to
31:45 take my pill my vitamin C as long as I
31:48 keep on that everyone around me is
31:50 getting sick I get nervous I might get
31:52 sick but then eventually I go no I take
31:55 C my TB 17
31:57 I eat well I don't let stress get the
32:01 best of me for any reason whatsoever if
32:05 I get into a stressful moment I stop my
32:07 life and I talk it out with myself I try
32:10 to figure it out I talked to God I talk
32:12 to whoever I think is gonna listen to
32:14 make sure that I deal with it like
32:17 usually what it is it's a little bit of
32:18 a PTSD thing when you get stressed out
32:21 there'll be that thing where I'll feel
32:24 stressed I will have had a weird day and
32:27 I'll feel stressed and I've what it is
32:30 is I don't feel like I've resolved it at
32:33 least with myself sometimes you need to
32:34 resolve it with other people you need to
32:36 say you're sorry or do something like
32:39 you're late on a project and you bit
32:41 goofing off but you don't really feel
32:42 like working maybe you're sick or
32:43 whatever and you have to come to terms
32:45 with the variable that is your life is
32:53 it possible to build a life without
32:55 loops well then say probably not and so
33:02 think about this as a mathematical
33:04 formula you're awake X number hours in a
33:09 day and so if I mean you could really
33:13 write this down on paper this is what's
33:15 really wild about this and you could
33:16 start calculating how much of your life
33:18 is going to be forgotten in a particular
33:20 year to a decade just by multiplying it
33:23 up just an average right because we
33:26 sleep that's a pattern unless you dream
33:29 if you dream really deep dreams and you
33:32 study them and think about them I assure
33:35 you they will become more elaborate more
33:37 amazing and you will feel like I feel
33:40 which is I feel like I live two
33:41 completely distinct lifes I know it
33:45 sounds weird but it's like my dreams are
33:48 a holodeck they're a veldt I go into
33:50 them
33:51 and a whole different group of people
33:54 and they're generally very unique from
33:57 dream to dream like I said in the other
34:00 episode about genes dream geography
34:03 they're you know I've spent about a week
34:05 in one place maybe two and then I move
34:07 on to the next place sometimes there's
34:09 some abstract ones thrown in there which
34:11 are actually super cool and so there's
34:15 that distinction but I do get up and I
34:18 go through my shower routine you know I
34:20 mean maybe maybe one of the things that
34:23 sort of parses the loop and the bathroom
34:24 routine is you switch from Gillette
34:27 razors to Dollar Shave Club you switch
34:29 from one shampoo that has a very
34:30 distinct smell to another shampoo with a
34:32 different distinct smell with this
34:33 conditioner and AH stuff you change
34:35 soaps I just changed the Squatch soap I
34:39 just go to stimulus comm and it'll take
34:42 you there so sometimes that's a way to
34:45 break up a routine you got an old
34:47 toothbrush buy a new toothbrush you get
34:49 some undo I'm doing to change it you
34:50 know maybe that's the way to kind of
34:52 break up that loop a little bit but then
34:55 there's the question of how much do you
34:57 want to remember your bathroom routine
34:58 maybe it's okay if that's completely
35:00 forgotten your commute to work do you
35:04 want to remember your commutes to work I
35:06 don't want to remember any of my
35:08 commuting on the 405 just so you know so
35:12 then the math comes out well if you're
35:14 spending two hours in a car everyday cuz
35:17 you got an hour commute one way you have
35:19 to decide do you want to lose two hours
35:22 a day to nothing because you're already
35:23 losing a bunch of time to the routines
35:26 that are getting up getting showered
35:28 maybe your regimen of fixing meals for
35:32 your kids and all that stuff
35:35 we got a squirrel he's roughing up some
35:38 some birds he's doing his little tail
35:41 wagging let's see if we can save these
35:45 birds
35:47 some of you see your jobs completely
35:49 different than how others see jobs
35:53 sometimes jobs are destinies you know
35:56 I've got a good friend of mine who's a
35:59 chiropractor loves his job his wife's a
36:02 chiropractor she loves her job I've got
36:06 all kinds of friends like that where the
36:08 couples are radiologists or something
36:10 like that right and so if they dig their
36:13 lives then then they're in that good
36:16 loop but maybe after 10 years 15 years
36:20 or whatever they're kind of like you
36:22 know I could do this my whole life
36:26 but maybe I owe it to myself I owe it to
36:31 my Creator to venture out and do
36:35 something a little bit different and
36:36 maybe you can do those two things at the
36:39 exact same time and while you're
36:41 engaging in your sort of autonomic
36:43 career that is now just you don't even
36:46 think about it you just do it you're
36:49 really thinking about the other thing so
36:51 when you get home you're gonna do this
36:52 other thing on the weekend you're gonna
36:53 really do the other thing maybe you take
36:55 more time off you're shorten your day
36:57 doctors do that all the time right they
37:00 do their internships they're working you
37:03 know 12 to 24 hour shifts and some ER
37:06 and then when they get their private
37:07 practice they go down to like a 4 to 5
37:11 hour a day like I don't they're like I
37:13 don't want this life but I do want to
37:16 heal people so I don't get out of the
37:18 career you know if you're an astounding
37:20 doctor then you know perhaps keeping
37:24 those long hours is what society can
37:27 benefit from your amazing skills but now
37:31 how many of you have told a younger
37:33 person no matter how exciting a career
37:36 is once you get in it it does become
37:39 work it does and only in certain certain
37:46 jobs would that ever not be true you
37:50 know very few musicians can stay famous
37:53 as a musician their entire lives I mean
37:56 we name them on on our you know we can
38:00 name them infinitely
38:01 like you know Rolling Stones or
38:03 Aerosmith this guy's can never stop
38:05 playing I mean because they're the whole
38:06 world wants them to play constantly and
38:08 they haven't broke up their band thank
38:09 God but there's a lot of bands that were
38:13 gigantic in every decade that you will
38:15 you'll wonder where they are that's why
38:16 vh1 made the whole series where they are
38:19 now that's because they fade it away you
38:23 know it's a hell of a thing to be
38:25 extremely famous and then be nobody I
38:29 mean that I am I am very I feel
38:35 fortunate that I didn't go through that
38:38 because I don't know how I would handle
38:41 it I don't know what I turned to drugs
38:43 for the first time in my life
38:45 what I start drinking for the first time
38:47 in my life I mean how would I deal with
38:49 it would I be totally content that I did
38:51 something really great what I continue
38:53 to help new musicians I mean I don't
38:54 know that's probably what I would do but
38:56 I know people that well like the
38:59 gentleman I mentioned earlier who's like
39:01 all-pro death you know you just like
39:02 can't wait to punch out he will do
39:05 nothing to hurt himself but you know
39:07 when he dies he's gonna be like alright
39:08 I'm out of this rat race or whatever
39:10 well it's because he's a legend and his
39:14 field of work he is a legend so there's
39:20 like a curse with every blessing sort of
39:22 thing I think one of the listeners
39:25 posted a funny meme I think I may have
39:27 sought on his personal account but it
39:28 was a picture of cave people eating
39:31 things and it says something like hats
39:35 off to early man for just for figuring
39:37 out what we could eat that wouldn't kill
39:40 us something like that
39:42 really clever a little mean and it's
39:44 true man
39:46 ate everything until we figured out what
39:47 would kill us and what would eat some
39:50 mushrooms you're gone
39:51 eat some apples you're super happy but
39:54 if you read a Survival Guide if you get
39:56 stuck out there in the wilderness or
39:58 someplace you don't understand and
39:59 you've got to eat something out there
40:01 you're gonna die they say - especially
40:07 with mushrooms I mean God try to find
40:08 anything else but berries to be pretty
40:09 bad for you as well but you what you do
40:11 is you pick it whatever it is
40:14 and you nibble a tiny bit of it and then
40:17 you listen to your body as to whether or
40:20 not you feel sick or feel comfortable
40:23 and I can't remember I apologize the
40:26 amount of time that needs to pass I'm
40:28 I'm pretty sure they said eight hours
40:30 which seems like an eternity if you're
40:32 starving but then your body is the
40:33 defense mechanism against feeling
40:34 starving as well you get over that road
40:38 bump of feeling starving and then you
40:40 don't have any recollection of how
40:41 hungry you are it's just an interesting
40:43 thing it's one of the best ways to lose
40:47 weight but for those who are obese that
40:49 that little bump in the road is a pretty
40:52 big bump but maybe that's the way we
40:56 experiment with our life in trying to
40:59 parse our loops a little bit baby steps
41:03 it's that Muppet movie with the Big Bear
41:06 that kept saying baby steps up so
41:08 hilarious the things you see when you're
41:12 a parent I tell you I'm always telling
41:16 you guys I want you to have more control
41:17 of your life and that's because I want
41:18 more control of my own it's a personal
41:20 theme personal goal now obsession is an
41:26 illness in itself so I'm not talking
41:29 about trying to create something where
41:32 you know you're dissatisfied with life
41:34 because you don't have ultimate control
41:37 over everything in your life hey that's
41:39 part of what's fun about riding a roller
41:41 coaster you're strapped into this thing
41:44 and you are trusting the engineering and
41:47 the previous people that have ridden it
41:49 that you will not die by the time this
41:52 thing is over it's not going to
41:53 decapitate you you're not gonna go
41:54 flying off and I feel sorry for anyone
41:57 who's had a major problem on a roller
41:58 coaster could you imagine the anxiety
42:00 that would install on you for the rest
42:01 of your life you know I just on that
42:06 whole stress bomb of potentially you
42:09 know creating a psychosis with this goal
42:12 and I'm not really just talking about
42:13 this goal want to make this comment
42:15 anything you're trying to do because you
42:18 really need a change to happen you do
42:20 you need a new job you need a job
42:25 you need to get out of an abusive
42:27 situation whatever it is if you're being
42:32 abused that's a little bit different
42:32 especially physically but mentally can
42:35 be even worse
42:37 you guys will hear me mention every once
42:39 in a while
42:40 boy does it rub some people wrong
42:42 unbelievable just a couple but the whole
42:45 thing about being cool it's an old
42:47 phrase we don't use anymore right a cool
42:50 cat
42:51 let's build ka T the the notion is that
42:55 you're fully functional but you know how
42:58 to manage your stress you take things
43:01 extremely seriously and to the best of
43:04 your ability without any ridiculous
43:07 assertion of your energy you're able to
43:11 deliver everything that you need to do
43:12 be a husband a wife be a parent be an
43:17 employee being a CEO whatever it is
43:19 you're trying to do you relied on by
43:21 other people and so I don't know how to
43:27 communicate that besides to just define
43:29 it a little bit such that you can you
43:31 can play with that whole thing as you're
43:35 trying to change any dimension of your
43:38 personal persona character in your outer
43:41 participation in life you know a lot of
43:46 times things don't have the urgency like
43:49 getting a job if you have no income
43:51 that's a little bit different but even
43:53 in that scenario I strongly suggest
43:56 treating it with an optimism that is
44:01 like what I love to call an obligatory
44:04 moment in time which means you're
44:06 obligated to make this happen and the
44:08 world is obligated to give it to you as
44:10 well so just relax it's gonna happen
44:14 dial it in feel it feel it before it
44:17 happens and that might be more of the
44:20 regimen for breaking these loops I mean
44:22 that's what I'm gonna do is kind of take
44:24 a look at the loops and what's weird
44:27 about this sort of ironic about this in
44:29 coincidental about this for me
44:30 personally is that probably about I
44:34 don't know two or three months ago I
44:37 just made a decision that
44:38 I was going to re-up my programming
44:45 skills especially web-based frameworks
44:50 cuz there's just a tremendous amount of
44:51 them out there it's all the same stuff
44:53 so I mean language wise it's never a
44:54 problem you're just trying to figure out
44:56 where do they put things you know it's
44:57 like it's be moving from your house to
45:00 someone else's house for some temporary
45:03 reason and you you know they have the
45:05 trashcan in a different area and
45:06 different routines and and you're always
45:08 asking questions well where do you guys
45:10 put this and you know when do you guys
45:11 get home again because I don't want to
45:13 disturb you guys you know you're
45:14 learning the protocol the new location
45:16 so that's sort of what I've been doing
45:18 in my personal technical life a routine
45:22 being changed could simply mean you
45:25 rotate your restaurants you rotate your
45:28 visits to different friends you add more
45:30 friends to the mix maybe you're inside
45:33 all the time and maybe you just need to
45:34 get outside maybe you don't need to meet
45:36 someone new you just want to be
45:38 physically in a different place if you
45:40 live next to some gorgeous landscape
45:42 somewhere in your local area
45:44 go take a look at it one of the biggest
45:47 things that happens when you move to Los
45:48 Angeles is that you will visit Los
45:52 Angeles if you live near it to go to
45:56 Sunset Boulevard Hollywood Boulevard is
45:58 Neil and Universal Studios blah blah
46:01 blah
46:01 museums whatever Beach Venice Beach when
46:06 you move here you stop coming I mean you
46:08 start going out to those locations
46:09 because they're always here and a lot of
46:11 times when your friends visit they want
46:13 to go to those locations and you're sort
46:15 of you get it you get it through taking
46:17 your friends through it and there's
46:19 actually nothing like taking your
46:20 friends to places where you're bored and
46:22 they start getting really excited about
46:23 it that's the way I used to feel about
46:26 that and it's not like watching a movie
46:28 where you thought a movie was great and
46:31 you show it to a friend who also thinks
46:33 it's great and so you're like is this
46:34 awesome oh yeah it's great and then you
46:37 show the same movie to someone who
46:38 doesn't get it and they're just dry as a
46:41 bone they're not laughing at anything
46:42 they're not being blown away by anything
46:44 and you're like you're having
46:46 automatically by sitting next to them
46:48 because we share frequencies and
46:49 information you're having a bad time
46:51 watching this movie that you
46:53 so just be aware of those dynamics as
46:55 you try new things and he'll even coming
47:00 home with maybe something you would
47:03 quantify as a failure I think I didn't
47:05 like that place at all well at least you
47:07 got out broke your loop guess what
47:09 you're gonna remember that time you went
47:11 to that place that you didn't like but
47:15 because the world is a very dynamic
47:16 place you'll find a new place a new
47:19 thing to do but again this could be
47:22 merely going your backyard when you
47:24 never go in your backyard you got a
47:26 barbecue and you never use it you got a
47:30 machine shop and you're in your garage a
47:31 wood shop or whatever you got a saw and
47:33 a bunch of other stuff but you bought it
47:35 and you didn't touch it
47:36 you bought a what is it the the
47:40 treadmill how many dead treadmills are
47:42 in this world and they're you know if
47:46 you look at the amount of feet or miles
47:49 that you walked on it it's got like four
47:51 miles on it and now you keep it because
47:54 one day you're gonna get healthy you
47:57 know maybe go do it again if you can't
48:01 conceive of it then you're on level ten
48:03 the second you conceived of it you're on
48:05 level five typically if it's possible if
48:11 you take steps towards it half half half
48:14 half half all the way down until you're
48:16 standing right on top of it and you're
48:17 doing it so in closing let's talk about
48:20 this little little nugget how many of
48:24 you in your lifetime when you
48:28 contemplate why we're here and maybe you
48:34 have toyed with the notion of
48:36 reincarnation especially because I do
48:39 you think maybe we're supposed to be
48:42 ascending in our consciousness sort of
48:46 upgrading our soul with our experiences
48:48 until we become perhaps as an example
48:53 very empathetic towards other people if
48:56 we start off very stoic
48:58 you know there's cultures around the
48:59 world that are very stoic and seem to
49:02 have no empathy you'll watch these
49:03 videos of someone getting cry
49:05 under a truck and there's a person
49:06 walking on the sidewalk and they just go
49:09 yeah whatever
49:10 did you do you do and you see it in
49:12 America and 50,000 people went over to
49:14 help
49:17 maybe our journey in this world is to
49:22 keep upgrading and upgrading and
49:23 upgrading and you know the sad truth is
49:27 and I don't really personally think it's
49:29 a sad thing although I don't like to
49:31 experience it is the negative things
49:33 that we experience in life are really
49:34 probably the moment when we grow the
49:37 most and I mean any negative thing from
49:41 horrific to slightly annoying it's when
49:45 we grow the most
49:46 and so this tuning of reality such that
49:51 you do remember more of it because you
49:53 abolish the loops that are so mundane
49:59 there's no maturation in your script
50:02 you're not maturing whatsoever in the
50:03 script you're just the data do does that
50:07 now if you can't perceive of anything
50:09 else you're probably watching this show
50:11 but if you can you're probably watching
50:12 and therefore you have the ability to do
50:15 something very special with your life
50:17 and it doesn't matter what age because
50:19 we're not talking about giant fame
50:21 things we're talking about slight
50:23 adjustments to your loops maybe maybe
50:26 you go back get some loops that you
50:29 forgot about upgrade the ones that
50:33 you're doing that project that you've
50:35 always wanting to do you do it because
50:38 that's gonna create a wild-ass loop you
50:40 know if I wanted to enclose this patio
50:42 and build it all the way out well I have
50:47 I know where to go to get the
50:50 information I know the guys to call to
50:53 handle all of the construction etc etc
50:56 well don't you think from the moment I
50:59 make that decision to closing this patio
51:02 to the point where I can close the door
51:04 and there's a big thunderstorm outside
51:06 and I'm all it's cold and windy and I'm
51:08 all warm and cozy in here don't you
51:13 think that break a bunch of loops until
51:15 that's done I mean I would never forget
51:17 a day
51:18 most likely of any part of that process
51:21 I don't know what would be after this
51:25 existence or whether or not this
51:27 existence would become even easier the
51:30 more we go through this loop which is
51:32 sorry the loop of life being reborn over
51:35 and over and over again again riding the
51:37 roller coaster that God spent a lot of
51:39 time building and being told that you're
51:41 not supposed to ride it again because
51:43 that would make God mad it's just the
51:45 weirdest theory I've ever heard of my
51:46 life green carnation doesn't exist
51:48 why because gotta get upset it's like I
51:51 don't think so
51:52 well Disney didn't want you to write any
51:54 of his rides once and it wasn't just a
51:59 monetary you know goal his it was I
52:01 built the place go for it man okay that
52:06 bird chirp you're hearing is an alarm
52:08 because the squirrels coming back how
52:10 trippy is that he's pulling the alarm
52:12 he's like everybody get inside oh wait
52:14 we're outside he's checking me out he's
52:19 gonna see me again we all need a little
52:22 something to kick us in the butt every
52:24 once in a while don't we I feel like we
52:26 do you know if you're on well is to put
52:31 this way if your loops get so tight that
52:32 whatever you're doing to make a living
52:34 or to enjoy your life you know for
52:38 anyone else that would be a level nine
52:39 for you it's a level one because you've
52:41 just done it so much you make it look
52:44 easy sort of thing maybe you might
52:48 consider kicking it up to level ten for
52:52 everybody else for you you just go back
52:54 and you're like well is there any way I
52:55 can make this better so I could perfect
52:58 this thing hmm because once you get good
53:02 at something in your mind your mind will
53:04 contribute that skill to everything else
53:08 you're doing was it the samurais
53:11 supposed to round out his mind by
53:13 writing poetry and becoming a botanist
53:15 reaching inside your soul to find
53:18 something that hasn't been said before
53:19 and say it's so beautiful that you move
53:23 people that's a hell of a hell of a goal
53:27 hell of a goal in my experience you only
53:30 move people that are at
53:32 level of your poetry taking care of
53:37 plants very interesting idea because
53:40 plants are their own being they have
53:42 their own consciousness their own life
53:44 cycles they need love they need security
53:47 they need to know that you love them and
53:50 you're gonna take care of them otherwise
53:51 they die anyone who gets a plant because
53:55 they think they look cool in their house
53:57 they usually deal with a bunch of dead
53:58 plants person who loves plants and you
54:03 know specifically picks the ones that
54:04 when they stare at the geometry of the
54:06 plant like wow that's so beautiful
54:09 that's a plant that feels loved and they
54:12 could get 20 of them and they got a
54:13 green thumb for it we're always looking
54:16 for new frontiers as human beings right
54:17 way back in season one my big epiphany
54:23 in life was that we are drawn to unique
54:27 patterns different than the patterns
54:29 that were drawn to on a daily basis
54:31 that's why we explored the world if you
54:36 grew up in a desert community and then
54:38 you said well you know what I don't
54:40 dislike this place but you know I'm
54:43 looking at those mountains in the
54:45 distance and there's this white stuff on
54:46 top I want to know what that is
54:48 and could you imagine something coming
54:50 out of a desert community walking up to
54:52 a mountain they don't really know how to
54:54 climb a mountain but they get high
54:56 enough let's just say it's not too
54:57 formidable they get up there and these
54:59 pick up snow for the first time
55:03 phenomenal friend of mine just said that
55:05 they had seen snow for the first time
55:07 really wild that must have been a
55:12 euphoric situation water fell out of the
55:16 sky in a condensed iced over fashion
55:19 that was that was first initially a snow
55:21 flake and then snow imagine holding a
55:24 snowflake in your hand for the very
55:26 first time in going oh my god look at
55:28 the geometry on this thing every single
55:30 one of these things is unique but
55:31 they're all symmetrical to each other to
55:34 themselves kind of you know any way you
55:36 want through the center and the other
55:38 half is exactly the same wow isn't that
55:42 huge
55:44 I am firmly now of the theory that
55:48 you're maint your mind erases repeat
55:51 patterns it erases it as the mundane the
55:55 useless why remember that you don't want
55:58 to remember that you have no vested
56:00 interest in remembering that so in
56:04 closing let's do this if you're
56:08 interested in this theory and if you
56:09 feel like damn you know I'm 10 years is
56:12 going by way too fast and you love life
56:16 get a piece of paper and a pen an old
56:19 analog system and write down all the
56:24 things in a day because think about your
56:27 weekdays being slightly different than
56:28 your weekends and I understand being
56:32 tired trust me to rust me and tired
56:36 could be an excuse that could be
56:38 corrected by getting better sleep
56:39 kim.com just supposed to have a post
56:41 like a couple days ago and he said never
56:44 deprive yourself of a good sleep but
56:48 specifically what he said was don't
56:49 worry about / don't be don't feel guilty
56:53 for sleeping any time you're tired don't
56:56 worry about sleeping at night as much as
56:58 worried about your sleep and his formula
57:01 was actually quite interesting which is
57:02 worth sharing he said make sure the room
57:05 is dark quiet and cold cold hmm
57:12 interesting
57:13 so he says you could sleep during the
57:15 day just make sure your room is all
57:16 isolated so the Sun doesn't keep you up
57:19 I'm so so acclimated to sleep when the
57:22 Sun up it's it's frightening my
57:24 grandparents used to take nap I'm gonna
57:26 get back to this cold thing in a second
57:27 but my grandparents used to take naps
57:29 one hour a day right after lunch because
57:32 they realized that when you eat lunch it
57:35 makes you sleepy my friend said Mead
57:36 never ate lunch in his heyday because he
57:40 said it makes me tired and I work
57:41 12-hour days so I've always kept that
57:45 closed and if you're young keep that one
57:47 close to yourself understand that about
57:48 your body but he always a breakfast so
57:51 is that there's the trade-off right the
57:54 cold hmm
57:56 there is a house in Pasadena called the
58:00 gamble house it is the house that was
58:02 used in the movie first maybe all three
58:05 of them no no be the first two as the
58:08 Back to the Future house that doc lived
58:11 in it's an art arts and crafts house it
58:13 is absolutely gorgeous you can come to
58:15 Pasadena and tour the house I think it's
58:18 on Orange Avenue if you're in that in
58:21 the area that has even the slightest bit
58:24 of interest to you go do it but when you
58:27 went upstairs on the second floor they
58:29 had this beautiful balcony it was
58:30 massive this house is beautiful it's not
58:32 a massive house but it was just the
58:34 balcony was bigger than the normal
58:35 balcony and it wrapped all around the
58:37 house is really cool but they had these
58:40 big giant I gotta stop using those words
58:44 it had a much larger sort of lounge
58:49 chair made of wood and the bedding on it
58:53 was super thick and it was probably
58:55 about three feet wide if not wider and I
59:00 think they still had the bedding on it
59:03 as part of the demo part of the tour
59:04 when you when you pay to go to it it's
59:06 like 14 bucks or something like that
59:08 it's worth the money trust me there's
59:10 nothing else just to see the set of back
59:13 to the future it's kind of cool you'll
59:16 see the fireplace that's one of the cool
59:18 things the downstairs set but what they
59:20 told us was that the people the gamble
59:22 family which was extremely wealthy would
59:25 go outside at night to sleep and they'd
59:26 get in these chairs and they had these
59:28 special blankets that would go right up
59:30 to your neck and your face was always
59:32 exposed to the elements not course if
59:34 it's raining you're not gonna do that
59:36 but they would sleep outside
59:37 and even though Pasadena gets really
59:40 really warm in the summertime I mean 100
59:42 degrees is not a big deal there at night
59:45 it does get immeasurably cool and
59:46 especially if you spent the whole day
59:48 outside you know going down to 65 at
59:51 night it's gonna be chilly and you have
59:55 to assume I'm gonna give you another
59:57 example of this but you have to assume
59:58 that the richest people in the world
60:01 have a pretty good regiment their Loops
60:04 are pretty good that's how they got
60:06 where they got and that
60:07 was part of building their own fortune
60:09 so it wasn't like they inherited it all
60:10 and they were just blowing it in weird
60:11 ways but there was another location I
60:15 went to which is a hidden gem of the Bay
60:17 Area the bay area has two main highways
60:21 going through it which is San Francisco
60:22 so you go south of San Francisco there's
60:26 two highways one's the 101 and one's the
60:28 280 the two ladies in this beautiful
60:30 wilderness area where the 101 s got you
60:32 know industry all the way up and down
60:33 the highway bit like the five in LA but
60:37 the 280 is one of the most beautiful
60:39 drives you can you can have and ends at
60:41 this street way up north but just south
60:44 of the 92 there is a mansion which was
60:49 used in a couple movies heaven can wait
60:51 is the big one with Warren Beatty
60:52 but it's called Philo Lee it stands for
60:55 fight love live it is on I believe 43
60:59 acres they have a mansion there they
61:03 have quite a few littler homes here and
61:06 there on there but mostly it's a big
61:07 garden this is phenomenal giant garden
61:10 if you ever wonder where garden shots
61:12 are done and we have a few in LA but a
61:14 lot of you know a game of Thrones type
61:17 things with her walking in a garden
61:18 sometimes they'll film up there they
61:21 film a ton of car commercials so when
61:23 you go down the 280 you get off on the
61:24 side road and it's just right next to
61:26 the 280 and that's where they film all
61:28 other car commercials but you'll see the
61:30 sign for finally and you look over into
61:31 the woods and you can't see it it's like
61:33 a mile inland and it's all strata with
61:36 like I'm like a miner woods / forest
61:40 kind of thing but they had the same
61:42 thing the same story about sleeping
61:44 outside and one of the tours I took and
61:46 so it started to kind of solidify of
61:48 like wow interesting right these people
61:50 sleep outside in the cold just a little
61:54 a little gym for you guys maybe someone
61:57 can study that or elaborate in the
61:59 comments as to why that's such a good
62:00 thing for the body you know when you
62:03 it's summertime and you you have all
62:05 your winter blankets that you waiting
62:07 for that one night when you get sort of
62:09 nauseous because you've got too many
62:11 blankets on yourself you're overheating
62:12 you start peeling them off and then you
62:15 fold them and put them away until
62:16 summer's over and maybe we're doing
62:19 ourselves a big disservice
62:21 I think one of the big things is that
62:22 when you're overheated you can stay in
62:24 bed for almost you know all day you can
62:27 go from your six to seven hour regimen
62:29 to a 12 hour regiment overnight because
62:31 you're too hot but anyway back to the
62:35 theme to closeout
62:36 I think there's some loops that we can
62:39 analyze so we don't forget what we're
62:42 doing here loops are related 100% to the
62:47 quality of life right so let's let's
62:50 just take slow inventory of the whole
62:52 situation figure out whether or not we
62:54 want to make any changes if you see a
62:56 change that you can make just plan it
62:59 out try to look at the consequences a
63:01 treat like a business just like okay
63:03 what is the what are the risk factors
63:04 and making this change to my life am I
63:06 gonna cut somebody out of my life that's
63:07 really important meaning you know you do
63:10 something you lose track of your kids or
63:12 you alienate your spouse you mess up
63:15 your job make sure no that stuff's gonna
63:18 occur but then just have fun with it
63:21 once you figure out your parameters
63:24 maybe go for it I hope you feel me if
63:29 you haven't been a deep thoughts radio
63:31 calm please go so we can switch from
63:33 audio to video there's a locked Facebook
63:35 group with a bunch of amazing people in
63:37 there we have a Twitter account now just
63:39 case you prefer to get your notices that
63:41 way it's a little slow on the update
63:43 because I'm not a big Twitter person
63:45 there are two ways to contribute slash
63:47 donate to the show patreon is account up
63:51 there in case you want to put in a
63:52 monthly ding as per the request of folks
63:57 that want to just put in a single amount
63:59 of cash and walk away I turned on the
64:01 paypal contribution link and so you guys
64:03 can get up there as well there's also a
64:05 tiny little store so with that in mind
64:09 take care of yourself and someone else
64:10 and I'll see you in the next deep
64:12 thoughts over now
