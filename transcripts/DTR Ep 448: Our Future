00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts so as I in cube ate up
00:35 some more I think sort of eclectic
00:39 episodes I thought we just do an episode
00:43 that's a little bit more generic with
00:48 the goal of sort of sparking our mind
00:50 for the next few years especially the
00:53 next 12 months just to kind of look at
00:57 our future which is obviously gonna
00:59 mandate that we look at our present and
01:01 that we also remember the past we smoked
01:06 probably the last Herrera still II I'm
01:08 gonna smoke in a while it's interesting
01:10 you know my own life
01:12 you know being on this planet for five
01:15 decades about 4.3 I can remember you
01:21 know you grow up and you just sort of
01:23 think this is the way the world is and
01:25 there's nothing you can do about it
01:27 you're trying to catch up with the world
01:30 you know you're trying to catch up with
01:31 your personal goals which you can
01:35 personally achieve which is what you
01:37 have to do and then there's this moment
01:39 where you eclipse your career meaning
01:43 you're ahead of the game you got perhaps
01:46 more options than one and then you have
01:49 a lot of that situation where you've you
01:52 know you get into your family you found
01:54 someone you can spin the rest your life
01:56 with at least currently hopefully
01:59 forever and then you start to cunning
02:02 you know look around you're up on the
02:03 Vista you're up on that high peak and
02:08 you can get strategic with your life
02:12 depending on how much you get out there
02:15 with your career you will bump into the
02:19 system you bump into the system fairly
02:22 quick but a lot of it you can
02:24 rationalize which is to say well you
02:26 know I can't get lodging for free I
02:28 can't just get money because I exist
02:31 you know Universal income I did a whole
02:35 episode on it it has some valid points
02:38 but it's never meant to completely
02:40 support you it's meant to keep you out
02:42 of a ditch but of course scammers will
02:45 come along and screw up everything right
02:49 let's just push all that ancillary you
02:52 know corrupt human being thing out of
02:55 the puzzle and let's just go with us
02:57 trying to be good people one to
02:59 ourselves to each other to our family
03:02 and friends etc to the world you know
03:05 the first thing you'll really discover
03:06 is taxation and taxation comes in two
03:12 different forms blatant tax that calls
03:16 itself attacks and then fees collected
03:20 by your government that are still taxes
03:22 for things that really are especially in
03:25 this digital age of no labor consequence
03:29 to any institution anywhere in the world
03:31 because it all happens automatically
03:34 banks charging service fees is a joke
03:38 everything is automated you know they
03:42 get to print nine times the money that
03:45 they have in their bank account you know
03:48 over and above what they already have
03:49 right so they have one dollar they can
03:51 loan out nine so they don't need our
03:54 help paying for their buildings paying
03:56 for their whatever computer development
04:01 software development they don't need us
04:03 they make money hand-over-fist they
04:06 could technically borrow it from the
04:08 government loan it to each other I mean
04:10 there's all kinds of ways they can take
04:11 care of it so we don't need to feel
04:12 sorry for them but so this occurs you
04:15 wake up and you run into all these
04:17 obstacles and then you're like all right
04:20 you might say to yourself well all I
04:22 need to do is find out the truth about
04:24 how everything works and then I will get
04:28 to my understanding and my ability to
04:31 deal with it up to an expert level and
04:35 then I will be the best at whatever it
04:38 is and maybe for instance one of the
04:41 examples might be learning how the stock
04:45 market works and thinking you can beat
04:47 the system now there are some long plays
04:51 you can do and there's
04:52 short plays you can do but what you need
04:56 to understand is that the businesses
04:58 that run the stock market they live in
05:02 100% certainty they have insider trading
05:06 on everything and so they never fail
05:09 they make you feel like it's legitimate
05:12 system you they make you feel like if
05:15 Warren Buffett never loses a dime on
05:19 average right he might lose a dime on a
05:21 day in the year would always look at his
05:23 his end of year summary dudes always
05:29 making money it's cuz he knows
05:31 everything about what he's investing in
05:33 so what does that represent to us what
05:38 that represents to us is that we can't
05:42 get the truth and it's interesting how
05:47 we have all these institutions that are
05:50 built up with television shows movies
05:53 word of mouth school and you find out
05:58 later oh my god all the news in the
06:00 world is full on propaganda fake you
06:04 know like damn what the hell am I gonna
06:05 do about this alright you know the first
06:08 thing I think we do is we panic because
06:12 we believe that we need to know the
06:13 murder count in Uganda today we don't
06:17 they do we don't if there's some you
06:23 know dictator that's risen up and he's
06:26 mowing down everyone in Africa like some
06:29 Adolf Hitler kind of character yeah that
06:32 should probably hit the news and we
06:34 should all worry about it but that's why
06:35 we have government intelligence agencies
06:38 military that's what they're supposed to
06:41 do that is their job is to protect us to
06:44 serve us and protect us but even me just
06:48 telling you that a a government
06:51 officials daily mantra and their brain
06:54 is to serve and protect they might start
06:57 off that way but they don't end up that
07:01 way do they because in the end
07:05 what we want as a primitive symbol to
07:10 our life is control we want to control
07:13 our world we may not even be greedy but
07:16 we might seem greedy to each other if
07:18 we're having a hard time getting what we
07:20 want or / need you just always thought
07:24 my friends I said look man you could
07:26 have the nicest person on planet earth
07:29 the nicest guy that Isis girl
07:31 they have never said a dirty word
07:33 they've never rumored anything gossiped
07:36 anything they just live within their
07:38 means they're a wonderful sweet person
07:41 but just like the movie Trading Places
07:43 Illustrated in a fictional sense if you
07:46 went up to them and just cut your mouth
07:49 over their nose in their mouth and they
07:52 can't take the next breath you will find
07:55 out what they have inside them because
07:58 they should fight you tooth-and-nail to
08:02 take the next breath and live to the
08:05 next moment and then someone in our
08:09 culture will walk up and say man you
08:11 were really rude about how you asked for
08:14 that next breath I mean you kick that
08:15 guy you scratched at him you started
08:18 poking him in the eyes how dare you and
08:21 the person's you know whoa what world
08:24 did I just wake up inside of right we
08:28 know you know without knowing even the
08:31 the mass details of it we have accepted
08:35 so many control apparatus around us it
08:38 is unbelievable some people might make
08:42 an argument it's for the greater good
08:44 someone just posted I think on our
08:47 Facebook Likes Facebook page for deep
08:49 thoughts radio just go to deep thoughts
08:51 radio.com and click on the Facebook link
08:53 on her social media it was a jacob
08:56 rothschild who again we think died in
08:58 May of 2018 we haven't seen him since
09:02 and he was doing lots of television
09:03 appearances around the time he
09:04 disappeared same with George Soros
09:06 having potentially died in October of
09:08 last year 2018 but the meme is all about
09:13 his family taking over the worlds and
09:16 controlling everything
09:17 with monopoly money very specifically
09:21 said monopoly money and what's beautiful
09:24 about monopoly money for the layman
09:26 especially is to say wait what do you
09:30 mean monopoly money well say well if I
09:33 said you know remember the game we
09:36 played last week yeah
09:38 remember how he loaned you $500 yeah
09:41 well I want the $500 back and this
09:44 person is like what are you talking
09:46 about it's a board game m:y Hasbro yeah
09:51 whatever that person doesn't believe
09:54 that that fake piece of paper has any
09:57 value whatsoever it's not an expression
09:59 of calorie energy of someone's hard
10:02 labor or mind labor equaling any value
10:07 but by the 1770s the Rothschild family
10:11 had taken hundreds of years of playing
10:15 with a fiat representation meaning a
10:18 fake representation of a real object
10:21 called gold and they said the law of
10:25 averages people don't want to be
10:26 carrying this stuff around because they
10:27 could be robbed their whole life savings
10:29 can go away from one burglary
10:32 so these started in vaults and they took
10:34 up paper notes against the the gold and
10:37 then we realized that no one really
10:38 comes to get this stuff ever even those
10:41 guys given another do to $100 note
10:43 against $100 worth of gold that dude not
10:46 doesn't want to actually come get the
10:47 gold instantaneously so on average only
10:51 1/10 of the people in the world come to
10:53 get the gold and 90% of them don't so we
10:56 create fractional reserve banking where
10:59 you can manufacture nine units of money
11:05 based on one unit of possession isn't
11:09 that amazing and then it just goes
11:12 generation after generation after
11:14 generation because no one ever
11:15 challenges these individuals because for
11:17 the most part we haven't awakened to
11:20 these systems of control eventually you
11:25 know the paper was still tied to gold
11:27 for quite a while I believe an ounce of
11:30 gold in the
11:31 19:34 is about 35 bucks now I think it's
11:37 about 1400 or something today it's gone
11:39 up to 1700 on my lifetime by ten eleven
11:43 years ago so they had a bit of a problem
11:46 on their hand because they it was still
11:48 fixed right
11:50 you know Nixon took us off the gold
11:52 standard in the 70s Italy was 73 or so
11:55 but prior to that they wanted to
11:58 obviously attach it to something that
12:01 had supply-and-demand roots but they
12:05 also wanted to create a set of laws that
12:07 are international to make sure that if
12:11 we're gonna do this we have to really
12:12 protect it
12:13 this is gonna be scams out there if you
12:16 attach it to to Pez candy
12:18 well the Pez factories have to be
12:20 absolutely monitored they can't create
12:22 too much Pez right but of course it was
12:25 attached to a barrel of oil a non
12:28 fossil-fuel substance that the world
12:30 creates naturally there's no scarcity of
12:33 it there might be scarcity at a
12:36 particular well when you over pump it
12:38 it's gonna take a little while for earth
12:39 to fill up the hole again but it always
12:42 will will always fill up the underground
12:46 reserves because it is what the world
12:49 creates okay well again I don't know I
12:55 wasn't alive in the early 60s when I
12:58 think the OPEC thing was finalized
13:00 Kissinger played a huge role in that of
13:02 course lots of people played a role in
13:05 that I don't know if the world was asked
13:09 hey guys want to do this I don't know if
13:12 the world voted on or the United States
13:13 voted on to be taken off the gold
13:15 standard in 73 I suppose they did don't
13:19 remember wasn't old enough to remember
13:22 so there's this this obvious paradigm
13:26 struggle going on right now which is
13:30 sadly globalism against freedom that's
13:35 really how simple it is do you want to
13:38 take all of these dysfunctional
13:40 government agencies of which of which if
13:43 you go into these agencies and talk to
13:45 individuals who work in them it's sort
13:47 of like a given that they don't run that
13:50 efficiently and they won't lie to you
13:52 they're just like yeah you know you know
13:54 we're doing our best these are good
13:56 people my DMV folks are good folks TVs
14:00 are getting a little bit better in
14:01 California but still the trophy lines of
14:04 stuff that wouldn't normally take as
14:06 long as it does you know there's so many
14:10 services that could be put online it's
14:11 crazy and they're getting better with
14:12 that but we're a good hundred years away
14:15 from the government figuring out how to
14:19 operate efficiently so it's not the
14:21 right time to move into an
14:23 all-government situation but there's
14:27 always that added extra element over the
14:29 government right because the government
14:30 in by design on a piece of paper it
14:33 looks pretty controllable by the people
14:37 but we lost control a long time ago
14:39 didn't we we have allowed our government
14:43 to grow all of them around the world to
14:45 grow to a level that we can't control
14:47 them at all it's not to serve the people
14:50 we serve them you know in defense of our
14:54 forefathers and several other countries
14:58 well it kind of works it kind of doesn't
15:02 work lobbyists that go in and used to
15:05 pay everyone off you know Trump went in
15:06 there and said lobbyists you're gone if
15:09 you've served in this house at the
15:11 Senate or anywhere in the government you
15:12 can't lobby for X number of years after
15:14 you get out a profound change to the
15:17 structure of this country and we're
15:20 still barely seeing the benefits of it
15:23 because people are still senators people
15:25 are so house representatives if that's
15:28 still enacted I mean imagine the
15:30 president that tries to remove that
15:32 executive order and you know you turn on
15:35 the news the next day and whoever's
15:37 president goes the the lobbyists are
15:40 going to be allowed back into Washington
15:43 Wow
15:44 are we gonna be stupid and go yeah this
15:47 is great
15:48 now you know pharmaceutical companies
15:50 can pay off senators to make more things
15:54 vaccinations wise or other medical
15:56 procedures mandatory you're always at
15:58 the
15:58 take chemo if you're diagnosed with
16:00 cancer and then diagnosing cancer could
16:02 be any tiny sliver of an inner irregular
16:05 cell she put this Toxie stuff in your
16:08 body now you're just screwed hmm the
16:13 value of our money has been a big
16:16 problem for the last 20 years in America
16:18 and in a very blatant way this
16:20 quantitative easing which for those of
16:22 you don't know what that means
16:23 as we allowed government to get gigantic
16:28 they simply printed more money to pay
16:31 off the bills when Barack Obama the
16:36 unbelievable traitor to this country man
16:38 I don't give a [ __ ] what political party
16:41 are part of the Iran deal that he signed
16:44 before he left office has to be one of
16:49 the most evident acts of treason against
16:53 this country where we were paying in
16:56 cash okay half a trillion dollars of
17:00 American money comes out of your taxes
17:03 comes out of your Social Security your
17:04 future your kids future and we had no
17:10 line items in the contract the benefit
17:13 of the United States of America that
17:14 whole deal was to open up the markets to
17:17 Europe not to America but um Europe who
17:22 you know in terms of like getting all
17:24 the politicians in Europe together they
17:26 all deserve an ass beating because what
17:29 they've done is they've said we'll
17:30 always make America pay for it the you
17:33 in America will pay most the bill NATO
17:35 America pays most the bill if we don't
17:37 like a tyrant in the world we're sending
17:39 American children into these wars I will
17:42 put 20,000 and they'll put 250,000 of
17:45 their guys in their death toll will will
17:49 eclipse how many soldiers we volunteered
17:51 in this system at any point in time this
17:55 has been going on and on and on now I
17:59 don't believe for a second then any
18:02 upstanding European citizen this is
18:05 Australian England as well would think
18:08 that that's a good deal like I don't
18:11 think any citizen
18:12 supports that on at large rain look at
18:17 look at what happened in Hong Kong just
18:19 recently we threw some support behind
18:22 the Hong Kong protesters and then when
18:24 they got their way they just had a giant
18:28 rally they're holding up Trump posters
18:31 they're holding up American flags and
18:33 just saying thank you back the other way
18:34 I mean it's enough to make you cry man
18:37 if you care about the world it's like
18:39 holy crap we're working together now
18:42 globally to get rid of globalists to get
18:46 rid of communism it's just one one
18:49 volley in Paris is still throwing down
18:52 are there provocateurs in these
18:54 audiences oh sure you know I watched a
18:59 video I didn't know what I was going to
19:00 be watching someone's been making like
19:03 these compilations of their very graphic
19:06 but it's important as a man in my
19:10 opinion that you watch these because
19:12 it's there's protests going on right now
19:15 in Chile obviously Paris and Hong Kong
19:19 and a few other places seems like
19:24 there's some Russian locations but I
19:25 don't know what's going on over there
19:26 but they're showing you the price that
19:29 protesters are paying to fight for
19:31 freedom and one of the most common
19:34 injuries the cops are supposed to fire
19:38 the gas canisters up in the air or down
19:42 on the ground immediately so it's like
19:43 immediately bounces off the ground then
19:45 slides under the people but instead of
19:48 doing that they're actually taking aim
19:50 at people's heads so one of the most
19:52 horrific injuries that's happening it's
19:54 lethal almost instantaneously these
19:56 things are shot so hard that they will
19:59 get embedded in someone's skull and
20:01 they're still firing off the gas so the
20:04 person is dead almost instantaneously
20:07 but they're doing that because they know
20:10 if they don't they're gonna lose Hong
20:12 Kong they're gonna lose the whole
20:14 paradigm of freedom and believe me they
20:18 know it's just the first wave believe me
20:21 China mainland China has is going to be
20:23 analyzing every technique that they used
20:26 so when they come back for round 2 these
20:29 kids are gonna have to think of
20:30 something new but I tell you what these
20:32 kids are absolutely brilliant in Hong
20:34 Kong I'm telling you man
20:36 yeah I won't be travelling to China time
20:39 soon if ever but I watched this video
20:45 the the riots are over wherever this
20:47 video was being taken there no police
20:50 anywhere and this kid was picking up
20:54 some of the debris he could have easily
20:57 walked off and just left it for some
20:59 street cleaner to clean up he was just
21:01 trying to move some stuff around and out
21:04 of thin air this white guy comes up
21:10 absolutely I don't know where this
21:11 dude's from I don't know if he's hired
21:14 by the government I don't know where he
21:15 came from because he couldn't have
21:18 possibly disliked this kid if he's part
21:20 of the writing group and slams him in
21:23 the head with a metal bar I mean this
21:25 was like a two by two piece of steel and
21:29 you hear the steel go Kong and hit him
21:32 in the side of the head is left part of
21:34 his skull and this poor kid was knocked
21:37 out instantaneously and I miss and you
21:39 saw the guy who hits the dude it's at
21:42 nighttime and he pulls back his hands
21:44 like oh my god I just killed a guy I
21:47 pray to god this kid survived but I
21:51 don't think he did and it's like that's
21:54 20 19 people you think this stuff would
21:58 never happen in your backyard
22:00 now George Soros has been trying to get
22:02 a riot going in Europe George Soros is
22:04 trying to get a riot going in the night
22:06 States of America by exacerbating race
22:08 Wars gender Wars everything and what's
22:13 really crazy about the whole algorithm
22:16 of the protestors today is that they're
22:20 obviously capable of finding folks that
22:23 are very uneducated I don't even know if
22:26 you would use the stupid word I think
22:28 you just got to use the ignorant word
22:30 but if you remember the busload of
22:34 Mormons that were at some Monument in
22:37 Washington can remember exactly which
22:38 one it was
22:39 and they're waiting for the bus and it's
22:41 not showing up and this Native American
22:44 guy comes up and he's a provocateur he
22:47 is a loser if there ever was one he has
22:49 lied about being a Vietnam he never
22:51 deployed overseas he's a refrigerator
22:53 mechanic a second that the guy that
22:58 busts all the false valor folks nails
23:00 the dude reads his record out loud
23:02 YouTube canceled his channel because you
23:05 got to protect the guy that's telling
23:06 you the you got protect the guy that's
23:08 telling you a lie and persecute the guy
23:10 that's telling the truth but if you
23:13 watch all the footage from that day
23:14 which was then squashed out you have
23:16 these black guys that showed up and it's
23:22 a very interesting chronological thing
23:24 which is why the Native American guy got
23:27 in there supposedly these guys are
23:29 throwing down they are talking about
23:31 exterminating the white race you know I
23:33 mean if by any stretch of imagination
23:35 that's a terrorist act being you know
23:39 communicated I am going to kill all of
23:41 you
23:42 right you know the anti-semitic League
23:44 needs to protect all holocausts around
23:47 the world all Jin genocide acts and and
23:51 provocateurs around the world they need
23:53 to be identified and placed in prison
23:56 mmm I mean they do hey you're just
23:58 threatened a whole bunch of people so
24:02 what if you go into work and you tell
24:03 your boss you're gonna kill them don't
24:05 you go to jail
24:06 sure okay so I know it's outrageous that
24:09 someone would ever say that they're
24:10 gonna kill a whole race but that's what
24:13 they were doing but now here's what's
24:15 interesting
24:17 had any of those black guys who were
24:19 there said okay we're gonna do a
24:22 two-step process we're gonna try to talk
24:25 to some white people today at this
24:27 Monument
24:28 and then we're going to talk those
24:30 Mormon kids we're gonna just mingle and
24:32 talk to them and see if we are accepted
24:34 and if we're totally rejected not
24:38 everybody wants to talk to you so you
24:39 got to have a little margin to something
24:41 then we'll go get our signs we'll get
24:44 our duffle bags and open them up and
24:45 bring out all this we hate you signs but
24:48 that's the button that never happens
24:50 right you just have this prejudice
24:52 inserted in your mind by someone some
24:55 groups of individual and then they carry
24:58 that straight to the protest
25:00 there's no hey do we really want the
25:03 same thing
25:05 maybe we disagree about how it's
25:07 actually going to occur but if we start
25:10 talking then we can really get on the
25:12 same page about how not on the same page
25:15 we are and most of it's all fake isn't
25:18 it I don't know too many people in the
25:22 South that aren't fans of every sport on
25:26 planet Earth
25:27 okay maybe not maybe not soccer slash
25:31 football but definitely American
25:33 football definitely baseball basketball
25:37 maybe a little hockey in the South Bay
25:39 PI not too much but they worship these
25:41 teams and they worship the players well
25:44 where are the players from they're from
25:46 all over the world we've had you know
25:50 nearly 8-foot Chinese guys well if he's
25:53 on your team you're really happy that he
25:55 put Chinese guys on your team
25:56 we have several seven eight foot tall
25:59 black guys I mean eight foots usually
26:02 reserved for a few but we have that was
26:04 it money the bowl guy moon dip bowl I
26:07 can't remember its name I'm not a sports
26:09 dude but the big African guy it was much
26:12 older than anyone thought okay people
26:17 love these people white people love
26:19 these people from all over the country
26:22 and it's through sports that they
26:24 actually are so happy that that the race
26:28 that they're accused of hating caught
26:30 the ball threw the ball dunk the ball
26:32 you know kick the ball I mean whatever
26:33 it is right but then on one flipside
26:37 alternate reality the George sorro's
26:40 group of folks also Imran rhesus now you
26:47 know I did an episode on cultural racism
26:48 which I'm fairly proud of which really
26:52 gives racism a dimension you know does
26:56 everyone like everyone else in the
26:58 entire world no do you like your own
27:00 race totally hell no hell no you don't
27:05 but you don't dislike
27:06 your own race because of your own race
27:08 you dislike your own race because you
27:10 don't like the way a different group of
27:12 your race lives and behaves talks thinks
27:17 but you don't think about it racism
27:19 thing but if you happen to carry that
27:20 same algorithm over to someone who just
27:23 happens to not have the same
27:25 pigmentation and their skin same hair
27:28 color eye color whatever native language
27:31 all of a sudden now we can't disagree
27:34 anymore we're not allowed to buy the
27:36 politically correct by the globalists
27:39 it's tolerance tolerance tolerance it's
27:42 like well there's areas for tolerance
27:44 for sure you know people hating people
27:47 for stupid reasons like their skin
27:48 colour well that's ridiculous but most
27:52 most of our issues have to do with
27:54 behavior someone behaves different than
27:57 another person and what's really
28:00 interesting is is you will have I'm just
28:03 gonna use white people for as an example
28:05 here you'll have a white kid try to date
28:08 a white guy try to date a white girl his
28:12 family isn't so upstanding his family
28:15 isn't respected by the other family
28:17 perhaps they're not rich enough perhaps
28:20 perhaps he's the rich kid and his
28:23 family's been known for being a little
28:24 snooty or they're just perceived as
28:27 snooty and they haven't been snooty who
28:29 knows what it is right it's the whole
28:31 romeo-juliet algorithm right okay I've
28:35 seen this happen in the Midwest the
28:38 parents one set of parents is against
28:40 the marriage now more often than not it
28:45 is the effect my aunt one of my aunt's
28:47 had this situation my family is utterly
28:50 respectable I mean great track record
28:54 for every human being going back as far
28:56 as we can record it but she ended up
28:59 falling in love with the guy who didn't
29:03 give a crap about money didn't hate it
29:05 but didn't you know it wasn't like this
29:06 defines me or something and he marries
29:09 her but secretly behind closed doors and
29:13 his family they didn't like her because
29:16 she wasn't rich and I mean like their
29:19 families probably
29:21 I think at least lower upper class which
29:24 means new money within like a hundred
29:27 years but they may have been they had
29:28 their own platen in Scotland okay so
29:32 maybe middle upper class definitely not
29:34 upper upper class but they were snooty
29:35 as [ __ ] when I went to the wedding you
29:38 know I went to the wedding and then we
29:40 all dressed down because we're about to
29:41 drive home and I went in to say you know
29:44 goodbye to my relatives I wasn't gonna
29:48 see for a few months and some dude who's
29:50 part of my uncle's entourage he would
29:53 have kicked this guy's ass had he known
29:54 this happened but one of his like snooty
29:58 Biffy [ __ ] [ __ ] friends sent the
30:01 waiter over to me I'm literally like 20
30:03 feet in the front door I am most
30:05 obviously not here to stay I'm hugging
30:08 and saying goodbye I don't know what I
30:11 had on but he sends the waiter over and
30:13 he says that guy right there who's
30:16 looking at me now says you know you
30:19 can't be in here with those clothes on
30:22 yeah so I just looked at him
30:24 hopefully he could read my lips and I
30:27 said just I want you to go till I got to
30:29 go [ __ ] himself and then I left you know
30:32 but it was just that's white against
30:35 white men so it's not pigmentation for
30:39 most people it's behavior and we have
30:41 cultural things that we do it really
30:44 doesn't have to do anything with your
30:45 skin colour it's where you live in the
30:48 world that you behave a particular way
30:49 all right how do I mean to turn this
30:52 into some racist you know anti racism
30:54 episode but that's one thing that's
30:56 being oppressed upon us in the current
30:58 day that needs to be resolved and
31:01 understood so we can live a better
31:02 future I have a very close friend of
31:06 mine and her and I absolutely love each
31:09 other to death as friends and we know
31:13 that we completely disagree about things
31:15 she's a she's a climate change person
31:18 I'm not you know our scientific theories
31:21 about how things work in the world are
31:23 still very different but she's very
31:26 open-minded and so am i we sit right on
31:28 this patio and we crank out a couple
31:29 cigars together she's awesome and what's
31:33 fun about it is
31:34 is that no matter how much we argue we
31:36 don't really argue we just you know
31:38 differ in our conversation she has this
31:41 beautiful smile and you know we hug each
31:45 other when we see each other we probably
31:48 sit out here no she no less than three
31:50 to five hours we could go inside gets a
31:53 little cold but when she leaves I give
31:55 her a big hug she hops in her car and
31:56 takes off and then we chat the whole
31:58 time we text chat the whole time cuz
32:00 she's working on a film of her own and
32:04 what she has said beautifully she's
32:06 extremely brilliant person she just said
32:09 you know I love talking to you because
32:11 even though we're different we really do
32:13 want the same things in the world and
32:15 I'll tell you what I prophesize this you
32:19 know my own experience the several years
32:21 leading up to meeting her on this
32:23 particular show and I I've always told
32:26 you guys that education is everything
32:28 now we might differ about what education
32:30 gets emphasized over another burner her
32:34 and I both know that we always kind of
32:36 come to that same pinnacle moment where
32:40 it's like ignorance is killing the
32:42 planet and I'm not quite sure that's
32:46 socially speaking
32:48 we have been this ignorant for several
32:52 hundred years I'll give you an example
32:56 and again I don't know European history
32:59 well enough to give you an examples over
33:01 there other than Magna Carta actually
33:03 author of Magna Carta after this example
33:05 we know America fought a Revolutionary
33:08 War if you consider the start of that
33:12 war from Lexington bridge shot to
33:15 Hamilton giving up to the bankers in
33:17 1812 attorney back on the first
33:20 equivalent of the Federal Reserve which
33:22 is not federal it's a private for-profit
33:24 bank it's about a 27 year war but the
33:29 people of this country understood the
33:31 tyranny of Europe that have been allowed
33:34 to manifest after Magna Carta which is
33:39 the foundation of the Constitution
33:41 United States and they were willing to
33:43 take up arms for almost three
33:47 generations
33:48 to fight off these redcoats coming over
33:51 and everyone else coming over trying to
33:53 press upon us now again we got a shitty
33:55 president Hamilton [ __ ] that guy for
33:58 life he gave it all back up again and
34:00 then it took Jackson to really pull up
34:04 you know put on the big boy pants and
34:06 defeat them once again and then Lincoln
34:09 did it again but Lincoln got shot in the
34:11 head
34:12 magna carta is like 1080 man I don't
34:18 know if you knew that I got a great
34:19 episode on it go look it up
34:22 just look up Carta si arte on the
34:26 website deep thoughts Rio calm and
34:27 you'll find it it's a real important
34:30 piece of history you should know because
34:32 as soon as they created Magna Carta in
34:34 the past this is a nice Christmas past
34:37 conversation the King started up some
34:41 taxes started up some oppression on the
34:44 people and when they said hey hey hey
34:46 and it was outside the the confines of
34:49 what Magna Carta was trying to protect
34:50 everyone against he says well you know
34:53 if you relax this one thing in your
34:54 Magna Carta I'll pull the taxes back
34:56 okay a little tiny you know blot out of
35:00 the Magna Carta until the whole thing
35:02 was blacked out and then we went into
35:04 massive tyranny right you have Magna
35:08 Carta at 1080 and then you have by you
35:12 know the 1500s everyone in Europe is in
35:14 hell because they've allowed kings and
35:16 queens to run the joint now the French
35:20 did some pretty cool [ __ ] against that
35:22 don't know how we would judge the
35:26 situation afterwards but a lot of time
35:29 it's just live by example America freed
35:34 the entire world not by going over and
35:37 defeating every monarch and every banker
35:40 but by showing you what it could be like
35:43 if you didn't let them have control now
35:45 we lost it as of 1913 with the 16th
35:48 amendment we've had little presidents
35:52 here and there tried to fight it but
35:53 they typically get bullets in their
35:54 heads Trump is the very first person to
35:57 flip double birds at the globalists and
36:01 still be alive
36:02 I mean for people that keep telling me
36:05 oh my knees a shill hey two things he
36:07 says that pissed me off is you know take
36:11 your vaccinations and 5g is great him
36:14 saying we went to the moon and I get
36:16 that one he's got a he's got toe the
36:19 line until we can prove it
36:20 chemtrails have not stopped - you know
36:25 irrespective of what the the Q cult
36:28 would like to say they haven't stopped
36:31 so the old flame is saying you know if
36:33 you don't know history then you're bound
36:35 to repeat it oh yeah oh yeah but now
36:40 with education and us measuring our
36:43 intelligence what's really interesting
36:44 about it is the game that we're playing
36:48 today and I've said this a couple times
36:50 in episodes but we're gonna this is the
36:52 whole subject in one linear thought
36:54 right because some kid can program a
36:58 webpage because some kid knows about how
37:02 to put a loud muffler on his shitty car
37:05 because he's got penile issues they
37:09 think they're brilliant but when it
37:12 comes to social intelligence they're
37:15 flatlining absolutely flatlining social
37:19 media posts in general can tell you the
37:20 average intelligence of a human being
37:22 their personal need to tell other people
37:25 certain things the the girl that always
37:29 posts the latest boyfriend man the
37:32 second she gets in a relationship BAM
37:35 I'm in a relationship
37:36 boom the profile is a double pic of this
37:38 person because what she's telling the
37:40 world is look at me I'm loved some guys
37:43 do it not too many guys are playing a
37:46 whole another game
37:46 the hey my life is better than yours
37:49 post right what could that possibly do
37:52 to other people but make them grow and
37:55 their envy because they don't have the
37:58 social intelligence to be happy for you
38:01 but still throw in and out there all the
38:03 time I mean you know you got a Hawaii or
38:05 whatever you see your whole life has
38:07 been to see the Eiffel Tower and you end
38:08 up doing it hell yeah post that [ __ ] but
38:12 that's a you know how many times you're
38:14 gonna do that in your whole lifetime
38:15 maybe if you traveled out once a year
38:17 your friends could know she's gonna go
38:20 somewhere in August I can't wait I can't
38:22 wait to see her latest photo or his
38:25 photo album or their photo album moments
38:29 every other day
38:30 look at me I'm at a party look at me I'm
38:33 loved right it's it's something that
38:38 which funny is about the time the
38:40 internet really got social media I would
38:41 say in my own personal travel so I'm
38:44 sure this happened you know 400 years
38:46 before I experienced it but you do get
38:50 to that point where people ask you what
38:52 you're doing with your life if they just
38:54 told you they're getting a divorce
38:55 you know they got cancer whatever are
38:59 they're struggling in any way shape or
39:01 form the last thing you're gonna say
39:02 when they say well how is your life is
39:04 oh man I have I've clean bill of health
39:07 I just got married this person this is
39:11 so amazing better than anyone I've ever
39:13 dated I mean my gut you wouldn't say
39:16 that because you need to be hurting
39:17 their feelings social media don't give a
39:20 [ __ ] does it it's like oh you got open
39:23 wound okay wear some salt in that thing
39:27 you know my social media is very locked
39:29 down and I don't post anything on
39:31 Facebook really on the deep thoughts
39:34 page is where I post anything and if I
39:36 didn't have a deep thoughts page I would
39:37 shut down every single social media
39:41 thing I have maybe keep Instagram
39:43 because it doesn't have that much in the
39:45 way of dialog it's just me posting you
39:48 know what I think are artistic
39:49 photographs of things and I locked that
39:52 tight no one can see it on Instagram you
39:55 got to ask me to join most the time I
39:57 don't let you join because I'm not there
40:00 to do that
40:00 you know the century of the 21st century
40:03 is going to be riddled with some issues
40:06 and what I find very interesting is to
40:10 compare it to the previous century the
40:12 20th century we cross over in 1900
40:16 America's doing okay
40:18 it's sort of
40:21 you know still in a industrial
40:23 revolution for sure we're getting new
40:26 inventions
40:27 you know Ford's creating the car we are
40:29 making all kinds of you know military
40:34 vehicles from ships eventually we did
40:36 tanks eventually we did planes all that
40:38 kind of stuff the 20s
40:40 what were they they were the roaring 20s
40:43 this is the 20s where we were actually
40:46 robbing the other European banking
40:49 cartel was robbing everyone who escaped
40:51 to America with their money but toxic
40:53 loans so was not the roaring 20s in the
40:56 sense of true impact on people's lives
40:59 it was that we were high on crazy toxic
41:02 loans and that was bad
41:05 29 they deliberately crashed the economy
41:08 and then what do we have for the 30s a
41:10 depression massive depression because
41:14 I've said you guys many times my
41:15 grandmother my father's side
41:17 she was scarred for life she's a very
41:21 positive wonderful woman but boy you
41:23 couldn't probably finish a week eating
41:27 lunch with her every day or dinner about
41:30 her mentioning something about how we're
41:33 managing our lives and how we need to be
41:34 can you know conservative about spending
41:36 money and all that kind of stuff because
41:38 she lived through a horrific stage it is
41:41 my hope that the algorithm of awakening
41:46 and correction that is going on
41:48 seemingly globally that this is just the
41:52 spark of people waking up now let's talk
41:58 about let's talk about future
42:01 predictions of what would need to occur
42:03 because you know in terms of predicting
42:06 the future well you know eventually no
42:09 one alone cars you know that kind of
42:11 stuff like you see those magazines go
42:13 interview a bunch of brilliant people
42:14 about predictions and man you know
42:16 sometimes they're really on target look
42:18 at arthur c clarke making predictions
42:21 about the internets I mean the dude had
42:24 it locked down as creepy as that guy was
42:27 it appears that most people knew that
42:31 arthur c clarke was
42:33 pedophile he moved to Sri Lanka and the
42:37 rumor was he did that so he could get
42:38 away from American law and live on an
42:41 estate and do whatever he wanted now
42:44 whether he was a brutal guy with it I
42:45 don't know but yeah so mm-hmm
42:50 people work closely with them definitely
42:52 came away with that impression so you
42:55 don't have to tell me all about him but
42:57 let's make some predictions can you
43:01 imagine
43:02 let's say because we want to pick a
43:05 future date and I did I'd abate to maybe
43:11 20 50 versus 20 100 because I think that
43:16 would be a very interesting day maybe we
43:18 do 2100 which should have a level of
43:23 certainty with some of these concepts
43:27 what well let me just ask you some
43:30 questions as put this way can you
43:32 imagine in the year 2100 that we still
43:37 have a king or a queen that has any
43:40 power of any kind
43:41 now they lie all the time about these
43:43 people not have any power yeah I've got
43:46 a few uh bridges to sell you in New York
43:49 if that's what you believe but could you
43:51 imagine them still existing with those
43:53 titles 80 years from now I can't I mean
43:58 if if Society is going to be intelligent
44:01 at 2100 I cannot imagine us allowing any
44:04 form of monarchy to still exist how is
44:07 it the Hitler's bad Mount Saint tongues
44:09 bad Stalin's bad but kings and queens
44:12 should still exist
44:14 what is this based off of the you know
44:17 the Lady of the lake passing out swords
44:19 you know you can't exam supreme
44:24 executive power just because some
44:26 moissan bent was handing out swords or
44:28 gave you a sword monty python quest for
44:32 the Holy Grail Michael Palin talking to
44:35 Graham Chapman about how he became King
44:37 I didn't think we had a king but what do
44:42 they claimed they claimed just as Graham
44:44 Chapman said in quest for the Holy Grail
44:46 that he was
44:47 made King by God's divine right boom I I
44:52 have God's divine right as your King now
44:56 in the past you may have had a few
44:58 people I got really educated very
45:00 quickly and most other people are
45:02 stacking mug mud like Michael Palin's
45:05 character and Terry Jones right all
45:08 right so they pull us out of the shadows
45:10 of cavemen you know brutality you know
45:14 which is a if you really think about it
45:17 we did have you know technically
45:21 peasants with no skills whatsoever maybe
45:24 they could get some water we still
45:26 didn't understand the way that you know
45:28 bacterial virus or bacterial sorry
45:31 plagues spreading rats and things so we
45:34 were still dialed back but you still
45:35 have Egypt Egypt and probably a totally
45:39 euphoric state thousands and thousands
45:42 of years before Europe was all of a
45:45 sudden dialed back to a feral State so
45:48 as we have seen this repeat itself we
45:53 don't want to go through another
45:54 repetition of everybody being repressed
45:58 again and and losing all their education
46:01 and losing all their capabilities to
46:02 rule themselves will we have a paper
46:07 currency in 2100 ask a Bitcoin person
46:13 who is benefited from a digital currency
46:15 with a fixed amount of money I would say
46:19 probably not but it ain't gonna be a
46:22 Bitcoin and the reason it's not going to
46:25 be Bitcoin is that the one flaw of all
46:28 virtual currencies as of right now is
46:32 that you could have a wallet a digital
46:35 wallet with some money in it and the
46:37 only way you're accessing that digital
46:39 wallet is through your cell phone and
46:41 you drop your cell phone in a pool and
46:43 you've lost a hundred million dollars if
46:47 you think that sounds crazy experts that
46:50 I know I think the number I've heard is
46:53 that if you were to total up all the
46:54 lost currency that will never be
46:56 retrieved because of the way it works
46:58 there's like twenty two million bitcoins
47:00 think something like that that will
47:03 never be recovered ever hmm doesn't
47:08 sound like a good way to run things
47:10 right you would need some central
47:12 repository for your wallet keys
47:15 whether it's protected heavily but you
47:19 don't keep your wallet key on any local
47:21 device unless it's just a duplicate it's
47:24 got to be like an Internet DNS maybe
47:27 it's a a bio identification system maybe
47:31 it's 50 different things you got to do
47:33 to get your wallet out of the vault if
47:35 you happen to lose your cell phone in a
47:37 pool but there's gonna be and there's
47:39 gonna have to be a way to get your money
47:41 back so we don't lose the currency
47:43 forever we could even have the system
47:46 say we know this particular wallet of
47:49 which the identity is still protected
47:52 had 100 million dollars in it and no one
47:55 has checked into this wallet for say 25
47:58 years 30 years 50 years whatever it is
48:01 some family members someone who owns
48:04 this thing would have touched it if it
48:08 was still active let's say a guy goes to
48:09 prison with a bunch of that stuff well
48:11 they could actually as part of going to
48:13 prison for a lot of form to say here's
48:16 my digital wallet it's going on hold for
48:18 my sentence and I do not wish to
48:21 transfer it to anyone else now if you
48:23 die in prison the state might simply say
48:25 well we have the right to forfeit your
48:28 wallet the government doesn't get the
48:30 chance to take the money but they get to
48:33 redistribute the money back to the
48:35 people these are unpurchased bitcoins or
48:37 something I think technically they're
48:39 all purchased at this point but plus I
48:43 think that one of the other reasons it's
48:45 going to kill Bitcoin and you may be
48:47 able to buy the new thing with Bitcoin
48:49 is the fact that you actually have
48:51 sooners if you remember the acquisition
48:55 of Oklahoma there was a moment in
48:59 history where a bunch of people lined up
49:01 on the border of Kansas and they were
49:03 told tomorrow at this time you're gonna
49:05 be able to go on your horse back or
49:07 whatever you can do and for all the land
49:09 you can mark off with whatever the hell
49:11 they were marking them off with you
49:14 yours okay well people went over the
49:18 night before snuck in and they marked
49:22 off a big giant territory and then
49:24 claimed they went over at the right time
49:27 at the legal time they were called
49:28 Sooners because they went sooner than
49:30 everyone else well my opinion you can't
49:33 start a virtual currency and some Shack
49:36 somewhere tell all your friends they get
49:39 to buy all the currency and then you get
49:41 to farm it out you become a billionaire
49:43 overnight simply because you were on the
49:45 inside that's not the way to form a
49:47 legitimate currency but at some point I
49:50 think fiat currencies will be made non
49:55 fiat again backed by something could be
49:58 buy gold could be buy anything should be
50:00 a rare thing but it's there and then you
50:04 can you can divvy up ownership of that
50:08 using a digital currency so it's a gold
50:11 back digital currency limited in
50:13 quantity with all those safeguards in
50:15 place for people losing their wallets
50:17 and then we have it will globalism win
50:23 2021 mm-hmm or sorry 2100 excuse me I
50:27 don't know it's gonna be a hell of a
50:30 battle won't it it's gonna be a hell of
50:33 a battle to fight them back every single
50:36 time that they attempt to take more
50:40 control and take more control my concern
50:44 is that we are so ignorant on how the
50:46 world works as a whole although we are
50:49 getting more awakened every minute that
50:52 passes looking at Hong Kong looking at
50:55 Paris I don't know what Chile is
50:57 fighting down there you never know with
50:59 South America whether or not it's a coup
51:01 by some Intelligence Agency somewhere
51:03 else in the world or whether or not
51:05 they're really fighting the bad guys you
51:08 know it was funny or I should say you
51:10 know kind of sort of silly that Trump
51:13 declared the cartels in Mexico a
51:15 terrorist organization didn't declare an
51:18 Tifa terrorist organization and then
51:21 backed out of calling the cartels
51:22 terrorist organization to hold off oh
51:24 really well we got some home
51:28 Romans we don't even worry about the
51:29 ones in Mexico yet hey anyone comes
51:33 across the border and tries to cause
51:35 [ __ ] doesn't matter if you're cartel
51:36 member or not you're gonna suffer the
51:39 slings and arrows of American law that's
51:42 the way it is currently all right are we
51:45 gonna really invade Mexico and go after
51:46 him I doubt it but there's a couple ways
51:51 to view the next 80 years we know that
51:55 there's a lot of cleanup that needs to
51:57 happen okay now how do you get a cleanup
52:00 to occur well I think everyone needs to
52:03 realize the place is dirty and I'm not
52:07 sure how dirty people think this place
52:08 is is it fifty one percent I think it
52:14 might be I think it might be I think
52:17 everyone who throws a vote for Trump in
52:19 2020 considers this government corrupt
52:23 to the core and I think they they want
52:27 change to occur so it's encouraging but
52:32 people die Trump will most likely live
52:35 quite a ways if he doesn't get
52:36 assassinated by Pelosi in the game and
52:40 so that guy he gets into his nighty
52:43 somebody does which means he's got
52:44 another 20 years to go but he's not
52:47 gonna be president for any more than
52:48 another four years okay
52:53 can he affect things after that and I
52:55 don't know are his kids gonna run I'm
52:58 willing to bet I'm willing to but Donald
53:01 Trump juniors gonna run right after his
53:03 dad 2024 and I think that after his son
53:07 goes either one or two terms the Ivanka
53:10 is gonna run and you know they'll be
53:13 they'll be very interesting to see what
53:15 happens to the Democratic Party after
53:17 all this craziness that's going on
53:19 because in the Clinton days during his
53:22 appeasement you know and I'm not saying
53:25 that what they got him for was anything
53:28 that I would be terribly concerned about
53:30 you know getting a [ __ ] who cares
53:32 right
53:32 it's just the image the problem for him
53:35 was he lied about it and he lied about
53:37 not doing it I had no sexual relations
53:40 with that woman
53:41 what's the definition
53:42 is he said all right bad move on his
53:47 part it'll be interesting in the next
53:50 you know year to two years where the
53:53 opposition parties gonna be and let me
53:56 make it clear from my perspective I
53:59 think that the most healthy brain in the
54:02 world is a centralist constitutionalist
54:05 slash if you're in Europe Magna Carta
54:08 kinda person you have mankind all races
54:15 all genders all orientations
54:17 what-have-you
54:19 inside your wheelhouse to do a do no
54:22 harm policy you could be a guy in the
54:26 South of Mississippi and when he sees a
54:30 homosexual male or a transgender male or
54:34 a bisexual male or whatever he
54:37 personally feels super uncomfortable
54:39 with that lifestyle whatever I just
54:43 heard it called a lifestyle on TV which
54:44 it really kind of surprised me in the
54:46 middle of this tolerance speech which is
54:49 that's usually supposedly a dirty word
54:51 but anyway now he can hate it all at
54:54 once but what he can't do and what he
54:57 shouldn't do and I think what most of
54:59 them don't do is go out and commit acts
55:03 of violence against those people it
55:06 happens but it's pretty rare but you
55:09 know obviously one is too many and so it
55:11 gets thrown in the press like it's
55:13 happening constantly all over the place
55:15 and I'm you know technically speaking it
55:17 probably is happening constantly over
55:18 the place but not any massive majority
55:21 right but according to leftist super
55:25 extremists you have everybody that's not
55:28 like us constantly persecutes us beats a
55:31 sub kills us that's the perspective of
55:33 the problem in the extreme left right
55:36 there's left people that are just normal
55:38 they're just a little more liberal then
55:40 you have your extreme right which would
55:43 be the people that feed the extreme left
55:45 these are little tiny reservoirs of
55:48 individuals that all need to go away get
55:51 educated whatever the case might be
55:53 but once you find yourself directly in
55:55 the center you do have a policy almost
55:58 immediately in your brain a methodology
56:01 of getting along with everyone else in
56:03 the world as long as they're on the same
56:06 path that you're on which is to do the
56:08 same but there are so many conversations
56:12 we're not having when we're trying to
56:13 contemplate our future the one that I
56:17 can't shake that I mentioned quite a bit
56:19 to friends and boy you know it doesn't
56:21 matter how brilliant my friends might be
56:23 how old they are this one always hits
56:26 them like a ton of bricks like they
56:29 never considered this whatsoever which
56:32 is my age-old argument on this show
56:33 which is we have areas of the world that
56:37 it's they're so far behind the curve of
56:40 Technology not social issues you know
56:44 you got some cannibals I'd say probably
56:46 a little bit behind on the social curve
56:48 but these you have we have tribes all
56:51 over the world that are one they haven't
56:54 made any contact with the outside world
56:55 some of them have but they still keep it
56:59 they keep it this you know the same they
57:01 don't wear t-shirts and shoes from our
57:04 world they they make them themselves
57:05 because they like their own traditions
57:07 but they're you know it's hard to
57:09 estimate you know could be it could be
57:13 as far back as 5000 years but it could
57:16 be as far back as 50 thousand years in
57:19 technical evolution well as the
57:23 population increases let's say we were
57:25 to reduce a little bit of the rhetoric
57:27 of being overpopulated because we barely
57:30 have occupied Africa you know America is
57:33 still largely unpopulated you know
57:36 Europe is different Europe's got a small
57:38 plot of land and a lot of people so
57:41 everything's accounted for I understand
57:44 why Europeans might be afraid of their
57:45 own growth but every country in Europe
57:48 is depopulating faster it's I almost as
57:51 it's almost as bad as like a Spanish flu
57:54 just flying through Europe in terms of
57:56 indigenous people procreating it's so
57:59 amazing that sophistication and flying
58:04 quotes would cause you to the
58:07 populate your own country what is it
58:08 Francis is disappearing off the map like
58:12 a like a puddle of water in the middle
58:15 of the desert it's unbelievable you know
58:19 meanwhile Putin's handing out the
58:21 reproductive you know credits you know
58:23 you have a kid you get a credit if you
58:26 have the kid you get money to stay at
58:28 home and you get tax breaks and all this
58:30 other kind of stuff because he knows his
58:32 population reduced considerably under
58:34 the USSR communism rule okay but we're
58:41 not having that conversation about what
58:43 do we do we don't need to we could do
58:46 nothing and except the way that these
58:48 folks are different than us or we could
58:50 get a plan together to get them up but
58:55 education would have to be literally the
58:57 first thing before technology
58:59 technically gets introduced the
59:02 education has to go up and then every
59:05 form of education has a bias every form
59:07 of education has implications we have to
59:12 watch out for if you had a tribe let's
59:15 just make up two fictional tribes like
59:17 Ace Ventura two that are against each
59:20 other and then you start educating the
59:25 aggressor and you at the same time you
59:28 agretti you educate the one that's more
59:30 complicit and just you know they're not
59:32 trying to start a war well your
59:35 aggressor might try to siphon out of all
59:37 of your education anything that will
59:39 give them the superior war based
59:42 advantage over the tribe they don't like
59:45 and the other ones just trying to learn
59:47 how to write poetry and music and make
59:49 food better or whatever right there
59:52 trying to make water out of flecks
59:53 sunlight or whatever and the other ones
59:55 always trying to make a better weapon so
59:58 it's it's a tough problem and I'm hoping
60:02 that someone in the world is having this
60:04 conversation but I doubt it you know and
60:07 I was told and I I don't know if this is
60:08 technically true but I've told everyone
60:12 who's in energy in my life this this
60:15 fact I learned in a flying quote fact
60:18 which is that there's not a single
60:21 nuclear power plant on the continent of
60:24 Africa the biggest continent in this
60:26 country and this world excuse me and the
60:30 insinuation when I heard this and I
60:32 can't exactly remember where the hell I
60:34 heard this but it was essentially it was
60:38 like a UN thing I was listening to and
60:40 they're basically saying well yeah we
60:42 don't want them to have energy because
60:44 energy will cause a population explosion
60:46 and it may just turn it a full chaos
60:49 down there meanwhile Europe and the rest
60:51 of the rule is trying to rape all their
60:52 resources
60:53 you know diamonds and gold and uranium
60:55 and lithium and all this other stuff
60:57 right so let's rape them first and then
61:01 we can give them you know a light bulb
61:03 that stays on 24 hours a day it's crazy
61:07 I do believe quite sincerely that there
61:12 are you know pasty white guys out there
61:17 that look at a you know an average black
61:21 male and they say you know they see this
61:24 you know warrior who's still hunting
61:27 lions man you know with spears and
61:29 they're freaked out they're like there's
61:30 no way I'm giving that guy our
61:32 technology because if he wants to kill
61:35 me he will and he can that's why I make
61:38 machine guns and bombs and all this
61:40 other stuff so if they ever come after
61:41 us we're totally safe free okay I guess
61:45 I understand a little self-preservation
61:46 there but that stuff's littered all over
61:49 the planet and all kinds of different
61:51 forms right and you hear all these
61:54 arguments today about sustainability
61:56 this is the mechanism that agenda21 is
61:59 using because agenda 21 is the deep
62:02 state plan for 2100 they want to be 50
62:08 60 70 years deep into agenda 21 with a
62:12 massive world depopulation event
62:15 occurring before 2100 I guarantee it I'm
62:18 willing to bet that they actually see
62:20 that occurring before 2030 because how
62:24 do they get their way how do they pass
62:26 the first milestone of their finish line
62:28 algorithm out of their plan without
62:30 depopulating the world
62:32 you can't make any agenda21 map work
62:35 without getting rid of 97% of this
62:38 planet most likely hell of a lot more
62:41 99% okay was anyone gonna pay attention
62:45 to that or are you gonna post the the
62:48 latest thing you did to make someone
62:50 jealous on Facebook you know where's the
62:53 priorities here hey you know that Jena
62:56 21 is gonna clean us all out tomorrow oh
62:59 yeah Wow hey help me plug in my 80 inch
63:03 television because that shit's real
63:04 important right now what's really
63:07 interesting when you get in a position
63:08 of leadership within a company would
63:12 there be your own company or like when I
63:15 was a kid I always ran the group of kids
63:18 that I hung out with just just the way
63:20 it happened man I was really assertive
63:22 and I always had a plan and always kind
63:24 of you know I factored in what other
63:25 people wanted to do but it's interesting
63:28 when you gain that trust from
63:30 individuals you know I never tried to
63:33 ever use it for bad and I don't think I
63:35 ever have but I suppose I could have I
63:38 could have been a Jim Jones man hi
63:42 everybody
63:42 you know I'm the Messiah and let me tell
63:46 you about Jesus handing over the reins
63:48 to me man and then by the way those feds
63:51 show up get the kool-aid out right but
63:54 it's interesting how when I look at the
63:57 drug proliferation in America you know I
64:00 have people try to talk about this and
64:04 it's funny how they don't seem to have
64:06 the education and it's all serendipitous
64:09 for me up to a point and then I had so
64:12 many indicators I went and researched
64:14 the missing DNA but we had you know the
64:19 Mafia was running all the drug trade in
64:21 America which wasn't anything like it is
64:24 today I'm not trying to write them a
64:26 blank check or anything but then the
64:28 Central Intelligence Agency started
64:30 watching them in 49 concluded their
64:32 studies ten years later 59 you know gave
64:35 Bobby Kennedy a job under his brother to
64:38 go after all the mobsters to be the the
64:40 point man so that everybody would say
64:42 well it's not as it's him all the Intel
64:45 came for
64:46 that 10-year study but the study was to
64:48 take over this liquid cash situation
64:52 meaning the cash had no ledger of
64:55 existing but it existed and so they
64:57 could pay for all their clandestine
64:59 secret projects and the first drug they
65:03 dropped on the American people was LSD
65:06 now let's deed was invented in the 30s
65:09 believe it or not and again it's if it's
65:12 pure it's totally harmless to you
65:14 whether or not I mean if you have a
65:15 really dark past it's probably not good
65:17 you take any because it'll remove all
65:20 those barriers you've been building up
65:22 your whole life to keep all that nasty
65:24 stuff in your past suppressed but it
65:28 could be literally what makes you
65:30 liberate it if you can get through your
65:33 bad trip or whatever but what did that
65:36 do you guys have heard me say this a
65:38 couple times but I'm gonna make a point
65:39 here in a second that's related to this
65:43 it made everyone love each other it made
65:46 everyone see God it made everyone not
65:48 fear death that made war seem stupid and
65:50 here they are running this war in
65:52 Vietnam and the protestors were all out
65:54 there then they realized they needed to
65:57 absolutely assassinate the hippie
66:00 movement all right there are four events
66:05 that killed the hippie movement the
66:08 death of Janis Joplin the death of Jimi
66:11 Hendrix the death of Jim Morrison and
66:14 the Manson situation the Manson
66:19 situation was the end of 1969 right it
66:22 was the beginning of the end of the
66:23 hippie movement after the Tate murders
66:27 and that guy you know who wasn't even
66:30 there didn't kill anybody
66:32 I have friends that just were like Java
66:34 no he totally was responsible as totally
66:37 this Tolia Amen it's one thing for a guy
66:39 to say oh look at Kathy Griffin it's a
66:44 Griffin or Griffith Griffin she holds up
66:47 the severed head of Donald Trump really
66:50 funny awesome things she did to her
66:52 career [ __ ] that lady for the rest of
66:54 her life well what if somebody made it
66:58 occur
66:59 within the week they snuck into the
67:01 White House they snuck it into Mar Lago
67:03 wherever and they're able to take out
67:05 all Secret Service people and they cut
67:07 his head off and take a real picture
67:09 with his head just literally standing in
67:12 the same dress standing whatever
67:14 it's exactly what Kathy did well that's
67:17 a Manson event then because she
67:20 premeditated the entire murder in a
67:23 role-playing exercise and someone else
67:26 carried it out she gonna get life in
67:28 prison for that I bet not I bet the
67:32 people who actually cut his head off
67:33 would have gotten the gun in the jail
67:36 sentence and she would have been shamed
67:39 for the rest of her life way worse than
67:41 she has been able to get it up to this
67:43 stage so hippie movements killed it's
67:47 now on a fizzle out stage everyone who
67:49 wants to stay in it moves to San
67:50 Francisco and then what happens studio
67:53 54 opens up in New York and the new drug
67:56 is cocaine baby because they had
67:58 relocated a lot of other growing areas
68:02 into South America they found out they
68:04 could grow really well down there and
68:06 now it's coming in by the truckload any
68:08 of you've seen the cartel shows the
68:10 narco shows on Netflix you know all
68:12 about the Cowboys coaching cocaine
68:14 Cowboys and that lady it was a cocaine
68:17 cowgirl I guess you could say but it
68:20 costs too much for the peasant meaning
68:22 us and so they rolled down to crack you
68:26 know Biden's kid still smokes crack
68:28 Obama smoked crack I mean like crack is
68:30 like something I guess the elite just
68:31 love or something but now it blows up in
68:34 the ghetto the eazy-e makes a [ __ ] ton
68:36 of money okay here comes the late
68:41 eighties what's next man what's the next
68:43 thing on the block yeah at the same time
68:46 you've got angel does PCP meth still
68:49 hasn't quite hit yet the heroin heroin
68:52 starts to become huge a heroines been
68:56 around for hundreds and hundreds of
68:57 years right your opium dens and all that
69:00 stuff but they got to be really popular
69:05 in the 90s right how many nineties lead
69:08 singers have died of heroin overdoses
69:11 quite a few now in the 21st century we
69:16 have the explosion of methamphetamines
69:17 we make a show called Breaking Bad that
69:20 glorifies the creation and sell of meth
69:23 Wow
69:24 the bad guys the good guy and the good
69:26 guys the bad guy
69:28 awesome man we're really making a lot of
69:31 progress here aren't we
69:32 why mention that in this episode because
69:37 look at how we behave like lemmings to
69:41 these people man you want some drugs
69:43 sure an LSD I kind of understand it
69:46 expanded your mind I almost think it
69:48 should be a mandated thing government
69:50 created so it's completely clean [ __ ]
69:52 and you psychologically evaluate a kid
69:54 to see if you can take it and then go
69:56 okay I'm here meet God boom a coke
70:01 heroin speed PCP meth what are you
70:06 kidding me blows out your t-cells all
70:10 that stuff they call aids well a bunch
70:12 of it's just straight-up drug use
70:13 blowing out your t-cells we are way too
70:17 complicit to this stuff and the kids
70:20 because they're not getting educated by
70:23 their parents they're not getting even
70:24 getting warned by their parents they
70:28 they just immediately fall in place and
70:31 take the drug it's incredible
70:35 my buddy Dave he I went over and smoked
70:40 a 1978 partagas cigar man 42 year old
70:44 cigar mind-blowing man but he played two
70:47 movies for me one of them is to help me
70:50 out with some stuff I'm Marty writing
70:52 but one was just one of his favorite
70:54 films which is less than zero which
70:57 stars Robert Downey jr. and a few actors
70:59 that I don't remember cuz they they were
71:02 birthed and died in the eighties it's a
71:05 real simple story of three best friends
71:06 and the guy and the girl are the most
71:12 there's two guys in one girl's but
71:14 Robert Downey jr. plays a guy who's
71:16 essentially hooked on blow cocaine and
71:21 what's funny you know funny has an
71:23 interesting about it is that this
71:24 ended up being life that Robert Downey
71:27 jr. struggled with in real life except
71:29 the drug of his choice was the heroin
71:32 because according to his story someone
71:34 slipped him the heroin within a
71:36 cigarette
71:37 he saw the dragon and then tried to
71:39 chase it for the rest of his life and
71:41 God bless every moment of his life after
71:43 he rehabilitated because he went in
71:45 front of a judge and said I'm done with
71:47 this [ __ ] I'm done I'm done
71:49 relapsing I'm not gonna go into this and
71:52 he is one of the most he's literally the
71:55 poster child of someone that did it so
71:58 hats off to him but in this movie the
72:01 fictional movie it you know the movies
72:05 30 almost 33 years old so hopefully this
72:09 isn't a giant spoiler for you but his
72:12 character fails to overcome and he just
72:18 dies in the car coming back from Palm
72:21 Springs to back to his home in Malibu
72:23 and they're driving him and they've
72:24 rescued him from certain death and there
72:27 he owes some guy 50 grand and his
72:31 buddies going to come up with the cash
72:32 to settle the debt and he just dies in
72:37 the car but it was it was the 80s and my
72:42 buddy Dave is slightly older than me and
72:44 he grew up here in Los Angeles and he's
72:45 like this is this is exactly what la was
72:48 in the 80s these super duper rich kids
72:51 and he lived down here with the rich
72:52 kids the movie shot in Malibu mainly and
72:56 he said you know coke was everywhere and
73:01 it was no big deal for everyone to have
73:03 a little coke on him and sniff it all
73:05 all night long get bloody noses and
73:07 what-have-you and so I'm watching this
73:10 and I'm thinking Jesus but I have never
73:13 appreciated more in my life growing up
73:17 in a tiny town in Kansas with 12,000
73:20 people at its peak with all my relatives
73:23 all in the same town with that code of
73:26 ethics the chivalry towards each other
73:29 men and women but the whole stigma of
73:32 your last name dictates what you're
73:34 allowed to do because we don't do that
73:37 they do that we don't you had your honor
73:40 you had your thing and so when I pull
73:46 back from this hole you know how's our
73:49 future gonna be well the big cities
73:53 create an environment that is toxic and
73:57 I'm not sure it's ever going to be
73:59 anything but toxic the reason why Robert
74:04 Downey jr. in this carrot this character
74:05 he played his name was um Damon I can't
74:09 remember his damn name in there but he
74:11 he was able to hide so his father was a
74:15 super rich guy his whole family was
74:17 SuperDuper rich ever talking like
74:18 mansion with a tennis court all US every
74:20 kid was super rich in this movie but the
74:24 reason why he was able to run off and do
74:26 all these drugs and destroy his life and
74:29 then get himself bailed out get himself
74:31 rehabilitated then jump back in and do
74:33 all of it again rack up more debt well
74:36 as he was in the big city
74:38 where nobody knows your name and you can
74:41 you can drive like I've said several
74:43 times you could drive down la traffic
74:45 and you could pick out some poor soul
74:49 who you know has no physical prowess
74:50 perhaps they're an old person maybe just
74:53 specifically give the example by an
74:55 older younger person harassing a younger
74:57 person they could flip you off call you
75:01 names you just walk up to someone a
75:02 supermarket and just be a complete jerk
75:06 to them and as long as you're not in the
75:09 town that you live there's zero chance
75:12 unless you break the law and the cops
75:14 are coming after you but there's zero
75:15 chance you'll ever see this person again
75:17 so you can be this constant jerk there's
75:20 a lot of you and we've all had this
75:22 experience where you leave your hometown
75:26 and either you go to the big city that's
75:29 near which would happen to me you know
75:31 big city which is not anything like LA
75:34 but to go on some field trip or
75:37 something maybe you go overseas you see
75:39 this all the time at bars someone's from
75:43 out of town if whatever reason their
75:46 perception of rules that make you a
75:49 decent human being there
75:50 your ability to be a jerk they all go
75:54 away once you leave your hometown and
75:56 you're just a jerk wherever you are
75:58 you're you're a little crazier your
76:00 little nuttier because you're sort of
76:02 feeling this liberation from everybody
76:04 in your hometown that keeps you in check
76:06 and that's what the big city does to you
76:09 and agenda21 s goal is to push everyone
76:12 into big cities yeah you'll be surveyed
76:16 like crazy maybe that'll keep everybody
76:19 in check right you're just totally
76:20 videotaped like you know thx 1 3 8 men
76:23 your house every room in your house is
76:25 like Big Brother for those of you went
76:27 to school K through 12 college or better
76:31 can you tell me that any class he ever
76:35 took and any teacher that ever spoke
76:38 ever truly sat the kids down and said
76:41 okay we are regardless of what class
76:44 we're in we're gonna talk about what
76:46 freedom is right now the whole day the
76:50 whole 50 minutes we're gonna have should
76:51 happen in grade school obviously and you
76:53 do sit with the same teacher all day
76:55 long but kids don't quite understand it
76:57 but you could make it so kids understand
76:59 it you could literally take a kid that
77:03 you know as a teacher of course and you
77:05 tell them ahead of time I'm gonna do a
77:07 little experiment with you so you tell
77:09 the kid everything that's about to occur
77:10 so they're not freaked out or maybe you
77:13 don't to make the point even more on
77:16 point but you get a kid and you go we're
77:19 gonna talk about freedom today obviously
77:22 same sex kid would be good with this
77:23 with the teacher but you grab them and
77:26 you just hold them and you how do you
77:29 feel you know how do you feel about me
77:32 holding you and then you just keep
77:34 holding them until they're like okay
77:36 that's good I mean I needed I need to
77:38 get out of this situation right with
77:40 claustrophobia claustrophobia for me is
77:43 almost a genetic addiction to freedom
77:45 I'm not interesting you get inside an
77:47 elevator and people feel like the walls
77:48 are closing in well why are you feeling
77:51 that way you're feeling your freedom go
77:54 away men weren't born in boxes at no
77:58 point did the genetic code of man say
78:00 and then men will create boxes and man
78:02 will be stuck inside these box
78:04 this mm-hmm we have freedom as a genetic
78:10 code within us and I tend to hope /
78:15 think this comes from our soul not just
78:20 our indoctrination to want freedom I
78:25 mean the only time that I think that we
78:27 give up freedom is in exchange for some
78:31 sort of safety as a result of a problem
78:34 reaction threat that's created for us we
78:39 as Americans walked away from at least
78:44 nine of the ten bill of rights which are
78:46 the first sort of amendments that
78:49 created they're not amendments but it's
78:51 the first 10 if you will Commandments of
78:56 the Constitution of the United States
78:58 after that we added you know amendments
79:00 to it
79:01 freedom of speech okay well there's
79:05 freedom of speech zones now gun rights
79:09 well geez how many you know you can't
79:12 have a gun in Chicago how is that even
79:15 possible that we walked away from the
79:17 Constitution at some zone in our country
79:20 because a bunch of liberals around the
79:22 place anyone doing that in my opinion
79:26 should just be immediately car serrated
79:29 if any judge swings a gavel and violates
79:33 the Constitution it's not oh no we're
79:36 gonna raise that to a Supreme Court then
79:38 we're going to vote against you and then
79:40 we're gonna repeal that law no no the
79:42 second you swing the gavel trying to
79:46 circumvent the Constitution you just
79:49 signed your death warrant boom
79:51 you're gonna put you on a boat you're
79:53 gonna sit in some gravel with the black
79:55 bag over your head and get mow until we
79:59 cut your head off or whatever we're
80:00 gonna do and for everyone else United
80:02 States who's at that level of authority
80:05 well you're next if you do it third
80:09 amendment is the one that we're kind of
80:12 vacillating on you don't have to house
80:15 troops in your house
80:17 I can't just like commandeer your home
80:19 and put troops in your house now in
80:22 America as long as they asked nicely
80:24 we'd probably help anyone in the
80:25 military if they needed that kind of
80:27 situation because we probably have a bad
80:29 situation we won a lot of guns in our
80:31 homes with expert training but still
80:34 that one's pretty good fourth amendment
80:38 eavesdropping oh my god we know that
80:42 that was obliterated by 9/11 we know
80:45 that before 9/11 they were eavesdropping
80:47 on us constantly constantly the phones
80:52 even Ma Bell was put in place to hear
80:54 conversations we think a lot of times
80:57 the technology is given to us too
80:59 because it's private enterprise and
81:01 that's just the way it works this thing
81:03 was invented No okay they inserted
81:07 themselves into your life so they could
81:09 listen to what you were saying you think
81:12 television was just this private sector
81:16 thing to entertain us at our house well
81:19 maybe for about five minutes and then it
81:21 was oh let's make it refresh at 60
81:24 frames a second and tell them that we
81:25 have to refresh it 60 frames a second
81:27 otherwise we don't see animation when
81:29 you go to the movie theaters and it's 24
81:31 frames a second but 60 frames a second
81:33 they figured out hypnotized the audience
81:36 puts them into a low frequency thought
81:40 process which advances suggestibility
81:42 from what you're seeing off the TV and
81:44 then by the mid 50s Project Mockingbird
81:47 by the CIA well it's where you get
81:50 Anderson Cooper he's a Vanderbilt
81:52 grandson did his internship at the CIA
81:55 and now he's a freakin host on CNN you
81:59 guys have heard me say a lot of these
82:00 things before but now we're all in one
82:03 conversation here do movies
82:05 indoctrinated just asking anybody who's
82:09 watching the new Star Wars movies come
82:11 out hell yeah used to be movies were
82:15 just great they were just great because
82:17 they were great and the funny thing is
82:19 again like I always say between 75 and
82:21 85 movies were just fun they were just
82:24 great stories weren't a lot of agendas
82:27 in them
82:28 they would have current affairs they
82:30 would have current thinking in them you
82:33 know punk rockers got really hot in the
82:34 80s early at least seventies early
82:36 eighties yet people would put them in
82:38 the movie repo man to just show off some
82:41 of the character interpretations of that
82:43 movement
82:44 alright it's not telling you to be one
82:47 just saying look you know this is what
82:51 this is what's in LA
82:53 London boom I'm not sure we're
82:57 entertainments gonna go by 2100 are we
83:01 still gonna have venues where you go to
83:02 see giant versions of movies I tend to
83:07 think so I tend to think that when LED
83:09 technology finally gets to a tiny sub
83:13 micron level the screen will look like
83:17 reality and I mean reality it will be in
83:20 3d and it will be like just a hologram
83:25 or a holodeck it will probably even be
83:28 able to project different angles to
83:30 better where you are sitting in the
83:32 theater it's very tough to do but you
83:36 know 80 years of innovation I think we
83:38 could pull it off depending on where the
83:41 world is that's either going to be in to
83:43 love a doctor nation or it'll be simply
83:46 a mechanism of Entertainment
83:49 television's oh yeah oh yeah now well we
83:53 get to the black mirror side of things
83:56 where your eyeballs will be enhanced
83:59 with screens that you have either
84:02 permanently embedded on your eyeball or
84:05 contact lenses you can wear I can't
84:07 imagine contact lenses would be the case
84:08 I do think a lot of the black mirror
84:10 stuff is gonna come true I do I think
84:14 that we will have cameras potentially
84:17 hook to our eyeballs and that storage
84:20 will be no problem so you will be able
84:22 to record your entire life and walk back
84:24 and look at it
84:26 that'd be really interesting for
84:27 disputes between couples you said that
84:30 no you didn't yeah I did you know
84:32 okay watch her and run it back okay see
84:34 look you said that here's what I think
84:37 is very interesting
84:39 20100 has three possibilities utter and
84:44 complete depopulated tyranny agenda 21
84:48 world population will probably go down
84:50 to around 200 million the whole planet
84:53 or we pull our heads out of our asses
84:57 have these conversations I've been
84:59 giving you 80 years before we need that
85:01 to figure them out I guess or you need
85:04 to figure them out now but before we
85:05 need to have them fully implemented and
85:07 we'll talk about population control and
85:09 how we can do that without pissing
85:10 people off we can get rid of dirty fuels
85:14 and bad power sources and get into
85:17 zero-point energy systems etc etc and
85:21 then we live in a manageable truly
85:24 sustainable world without cataclysmic
85:27 Orwellian draconian death camps to make
85:31 it happen and then there's the third
85:33 choice which is more of the same the war
85:36 continues it rages one decade seems like
85:41 the globalists are winning another
85:42 decade another Trump gets in there and
85:44 we seem like the people are winning who
85:47 knows again an idea is the most powerful
85:50 thing we could possibly pass from one
85:52 human being to another
85:53 which is why in my opinion if we don't
85:57 have these conversations that I advance
85:59 on this show and I want you to obviously
86:02 filter it into your more accessible
86:05 words right you will boil down something
86:08 I say into a much simpler form so you're
86:11 extremely vital component to the world
86:15 being a happy place because you're gonna
86:18 be able to access groups that I can't
86:19 accessible and mentally but if we can
86:23 just pass out a reeducation on tyranny
86:26 on the lunacy of kings and queens on the
86:29 lunacy of compound interest and use a
86:31 tree we might find ourselves in a
86:34 wonderful world if we could clean up
86:37 this world in 80 years would you think
86:39 that's a long time or a flash in the pan
86:44 now let's lighten the load a little bit
86:47 of a serious tone of this episode and
86:50 have a little bit of fun with what could
86:52 derail
86:53 this stuff in a very interesting way
86:55 let's go for the first one in the next
87:00 80 years at some point a UFO shows up on
87:06 earth and lands and aliens come out hmm
87:13 well what would that do to our plans
87:18 well perspective would change quite a
87:21 bit wouldn't it depending especially on
87:23 where they're from you know there's the
87:25 old idea of the alien invasion there's a
87:28 bad alien invasion and then there's this
87:30 Vulcan landing hey how you doing and
87:33 let's just say it's gonna be more of a
87:34 hey how're you doing because an alien
87:36 invasion of like edge of tomorrow that's
87:38 just the full extermination of humanity
87:40 and believe me if they wanted to do that
87:42 I'm pretty sure they could probably
87:43 probably do that without even thinking
87:45 twice but they show up we have all of
87:48 our agendas all the things that we say
87:50 is one way or the other now imagine if
87:53 aliens show up and they go what are you
87:58 using to power your stuff and we say
88:00 coal oil gas and then we have many ways
88:06 of creating electricity with these other
88:08 resources wind and waves and water and
88:13 they okay and they say to us well what
88:18 did you say that oil was a fossil fuel
88:21 what do you mean by that
88:22 oh and this liberal walks up and goes -
88:25 oh my gosh it's not only a fossil fuel
88:27 but it's a huge scarcity there's this
88:30 peak oil thing it's about to occur which
88:33 will never occur in your lifetime okay
88:35 and I couldn't be funny if they try to
88:38 fake Peak Oil shutdowns like oh there's
88:40 no more oil in the whole world because
88:41 we've mined it all and then all sudden
88:43 starts bubbling up on the ground and be
88:44 hilarious to pull that little scam the
88:47 alien and some I don't know Joe Rogan
88:51 show imagine a little gray with like its
88:53 headphones on and he says it's not a
88:58 fossil fuel what made you think that
89:00 here's the algorithm how it works do to
89:02 do to do to do to do and this is the
89:04 world creates it all the deepest
89:07 like yeah we knew that already it was
89:10 like what did you think it was at the
89:11 center of your world causing your
89:13 compasses to go around nickel-iron
89:15 there's no nickel iron in the center of
89:18 your planet it's all electricity it's
89:20 all plasma energy it's mainly hollow as
89:22 a matter of fact so is your son Oh
89:24 oh my god so an alien showing up would
89:30 initially most likely if we could gain
89:32 full access to several of them that
89:35 reeducate that terror world all these
89:38 scientists would be deemed nearly
89:42 useless bags of water who have been
89:47 lying to you and lying to you in line
89:49 too because once the aliens come out and
89:51 say this [ __ ] ain't fossil fuel I've
89:54 been telling everybody this is the case
89:56 but the professor's in in Oxford and
89:59 Cambridge and MIT and Caltech have been
90:02 lying to you forever these institutions
90:05 will go down the tubes
90:06 overnight hmm but here's the magic
90:12 question for them furled for those of
90:16 you're old enough the $64,000 question
90:18 which is how do you run your world man
90:23 maybe they go well you know we don't
90:25 have the stuff you call money we just do
90:28 what we know needs to be done and we've
90:30 always have educational programs from
90:32 the kids so for the moment our little
90:34 hatchlings come out of the eggs we start
90:36 educating them I like the curl maybe
90:39 they got a brain booster machine to
90:42 shock the neural net and turned it on
90:44 even deeper using 100 percent of your
90:46 brain we make sure our visual cortex
90:50 completely works so we get to see all
90:52 that is to see in the universe took us a
90:55 while to you know adapt to it we don't
90:57 even talk we use telepathy why waste all
91:01 this caliber energy on your mouth you
91:03 think about they might have like really
91:04 bad breath because they never open their
91:06 mouth and then all of a sudden all of
91:09 this party system that we have this left
91:13 versus right Labor Party versus this
91:15 party all this other stuff just vanishes
91:19 because it's
91:21 the most complex way to run a country
91:23 you know what blows my mind is that we
91:26 actually bought the two-party system and
91:29 I've gone back and forth on this show
91:32 about what I believe about the two-party
91:33 system but in the end if you really
91:35 thought about it it's pretty simple like
91:40 micro cult Michael Colliers to say on
91:41 Venice Beach there's only one race and
91:43 that's a human race so why do you need
91:46 two parties it's one party
91:49 these parties incubate up in our minds
91:52 these opposition positions these
91:54 platforms that go well we have to be
91:55 against the other guys so what what is
91:58 the opposite of everything that they're
91:59 saying well it's this but this doesn't
92:01 make any sense what we have to do we
92:03 have to go completely against what they
92:05 say really yeah man it makes us a ton of
92:08 money don't you want a ton of money oh
92:09 yeah yeah sure so it's a chill chill
92:13 chill could we just make the American
92:16 government party the people's party
92:19 there is no other party it's not led by
92:22 a dictator it's not led by a king or a
92:24 queen it is simply just say you know as
92:30 a citizen of that party you know as a as
92:33 a servant within the government
92:35 I can't stay forever maybe the most
92:38 amount of years you can serve as eight
92:40 years two presidential terms Senate gets
92:43 knocked from a six-year term to a four
92:45 and they get to the house gets four twos
92:50 you're out in eight years so you can't
92:52 cause that much crap and you could be
92:54 kicked out at any point in time if
92:55 you're caught doing is this is honest
92:57 talk to a lobby want lobbyists one time
93:00 go to the wrong meeting behind closed
93:02 doors you violate the Logan Act boom
93:04 you're not only out but you're in jail
93:06 maybe not for life but you're gonna go
93:08 away for a while got to make sure people
93:11 follow those rules whereas the rule
93:13 common-law don't hurt anybody and
93:15 fortify the world to protect man an
93:18 education education honestly should be
93:22 as constant in your life in my opinion
93:25 as you eating and drinking to stay alive
93:29 maybe instead of you know in the you
93:33 know by 2100 what would
93:34 life be if we actually got this thing
93:36 together now you'd wake up you have
93:42 lodging you have food maybe maybe you
93:46 know I don't know maybe you don't need
93:48 that forty thousand square foot house
93:50 for two people maybe that's just a thing
93:52 of the past like Downton Abbey you know
93:54 they show the the falling of the rich
93:57 which is the overwhelming arc of why the
93:59 show was made in the first place there
94:02 won't be any rich people in the world no
94:04 but they'll be kings and queens and
94:05 there'll be big bankers is still on
94:07 gigantic estates but for you know
94:10 they'll never be a rich person again
94:12 but maybe honestly if we reprioritize
94:16 our lives well everyone has a really
94:18 nice virtual reality television you can
94:21 sit there and look at like again
94:23 submicron l direct LED technology will
94:26 be like it'll be denser than the retina
94:28 in your eyeball it'll be denser than the
94:32 screens and your telephones today you'll
94:36 have it food okay what do you want the
94:39 machine makes it done water it's clean
94:42 no fluoride no poisons no medicine good
94:46 health
94:47 you're never sick you're never ever sick
94:50 so health care yeah no one ever catches
94:54 cancer no one ever catches the cold no
94:57 one catches anything boom think we could
95:00 do that in 80 years I think we could
95:02 your food and your water maybe it's just
95:04 full of the vitamins that the human body
95:06 needs no synthetics whatsoever
95:08 all natural but maybe we pull our heads
95:11 out and we start eating the foods that
95:13 actually have all these things naturally
95:14 in them you know I learned from that
95:17 dude who's the anti vegan online if you
95:20 were to drink an eight ounce glass of
95:23 orange juice freshly squeezed not
95:25 concentrate crap you will sustain that
95:29 liquid in your body better than three
95:32 glasses of water of the same size
95:34 meaning three eight ounce glasses of
95:36 water it will pass through your system
95:38 super fast you'll pee it out before you
95:40 can actually use the moisture for
95:41 anything in your body but if you eat it
95:43 as a part of organic matter it stays in
95:47 your body a long time plus its pass
95:48 seeing all this vitamin C and nutrients
95:50 in your body if we can clean up our
95:53 skies well geez going outside would be
95:55 easy every kid every adult part of your
95:58 regimen is to read a book outside maybe
96:00 and if you live in a real rainy part of
96:02 the world but will turn on the tanning
96:04 lamps so you can get some good vitamin D
96:06 if you happen to live in Alaska and
96:08 you're in six months in the dark but
96:10 education it's around you constantly
96:14 what do you do what do you do today do
96:17 you want to transition careers let's
96:19 just say you're a plumber but you sing
96:22 while you plum and someone notices
96:25 you've got a good voice or at least have
96:27 the budding mechanics of a good voice
96:31 you can sign up to join the class to
96:34 learn how to sing and the government
96:37 because you don't need money this is
96:39 yeah sure fine you get this much time to
96:42 go do this thing you know will pay for
96:44 everything it's good because the
96:47 government serves you I'm talking about
96:49 a fantasy world trust me you don't need
96:52 to worry about someone coming around
96:53 your door to haul you off right what are
96:58 these kids you know get stuck in their
97:00 parents basements because they can't
97:04 find a job that pays enough money for
97:06 them to have their own place because
97:09 they get depressed because all the
97:11 dreams that they ever had can't come
97:13 true and no one's there to help right
97:17 there's plenty of guys out there that
97:19 are 5-1 and they'll never ever be any
97:22 taller than 5-1 but they wanted to be a
97:26 linebacker for a football team so you
97:30 know the doctors get in there and
97:32 they're like if they can't get you up to
97:33 some acceptable height and weight to get
97:35 that happen all right well here's the
97:38 thing you love football right yeah total
97:40 football stuff okay
97:41 so what if I told you this you will not
97:44 be a player you could play with your
97:46 buddies and stuff maybe you can start a
97:48 shorter league who knows but in the
97:51 meantime you can work for a team
97:54 somewhere and be a vital part of how you
97:58 could be a coach defensive coach it
98:00 could be anything it could take care of
98:02 the game
98:02 and be involved does that sound good
98:05 yeah okay so you didn't quite get
98:08 exactly what you wanted but you know
98:10 what you might actually end up in your
98:12 50s without broken knees and broken
98:14 backs and all this other stuff which
98:16 hopefully Beverly Crusher will exist in
98:18 2100 to heal all of our bones but you
98:22 get your dreams somehow or because
98:24 education is so prolific you don't just
98:28 have one dream you've got a hundred
98:29 dreams and you know that in your
98:31 lifetime you won't get them all so one
98:34 falls short
98:35 hey the next one down is pretty good we
98:38 could manage our life this way today
98:40 it's just a little tougher right people
98:42 always ask you you know what do you want
98:44 your life to be like in a year or five
98:45 years ten years and I've heard people I
98:48 was at a restaurant the other day and I
98:51 heard someone talking to someone else
98:54 and they were really really happy I
98:55 don't know what happened to their life
98:57 but what I heard them say to the other
98:59 person was you know what changed my life
99:02 and the person goes what and he said
99:03 when so-and-so asked me where I want to
99:05 be one five and ten years from now and I
99:08 had never considered that that answer
99:11 and when I did I realized I needed to
99:14 make profound changes in my life and
99:16 they did and obviously I was staring at
99:19 them within the first year being much
99:23 happier in life you know I'm gonna
99:26 repeat something here because I a little
99:27 more room in my steak this episode's
99:29 gonna be dreadfully long but when I did
99:32 my episode on money especially fiat
99:35 currency I suggested that banking be
99:38 removed from the private sector because
99:40 it is such a vital system of our life
99:43 that no one should be allowed to create
99:46 a private for-profit bank that can just
99:49 make up fees and make up all kinds of
99:51 weird contingencies you know like you
99:52 you what is it you you bounce your your
99:58 balance could bounce $14 and you'll have
100:01 $40 worth of charges for that one bounce
100:03 that should be just a federal penalty
100:08 and but should be a felony against a
100:09 bank to do such a thing
100:11 you can't penalize someone more than the
100:13 amount that they owe you for the bounce
100:15 even if you cover the debt
100:16 you just can't make it up but anyway one
100:19 of the scenarios I gave and I just spoke
100:20 about this today today as I said that
100:24 you know we do need to want to clean up
100:26 the government clean up all the swampy
100:28 scumbags that serve kings and queens and
100:30 bankers and all these cartels and
100:32 what-have-you banking cartels mainly and
100:37 bring banking back into government once
100:41 we clean it up this is an ideal
100:43 situation but give it some time here in
100:45 your brain but let's just say I use
100:48 myself as an example I've talked about
100:52 this direct led 3d theater that I worked
100:56 on with my buddy Richard Taylor all
100:59 right well it was gonna cost us several
101:01 million dollars to start our company and
101:02 we had found the investor but due to
101:04 another guy being a complete liar we
101:07 couldn't get the product created
101:09 reliably and so but let's just say we
101:14 needed my partner in our Richard instead
101:16 of getting an investor you know a
101:19 venture capitalist guy who brought in
101:22 you know a bunch of weird DNA into the
101:23 company he wasn't a part of the
101:25 entertainment industry at all so he was
101:27 see we really tried but he knew he even
101:30 told us he feels like I want to be out
101:31 of this thing as soon as possible I want
101:33 to turn it over to other folks because
101:35 this is not my game and I got a new
101:37 little girl and I want to spend my life
101:38 with her and it's great priority set
101:41 have we been able to go to this bank and
101:45 say look we need X amount of dollars to
101:46 make this happen this is a foregone
101:48 conclusion movie theaters are gonna go
101:50 from projection to led it's just going
101:52 to take place and they said okay this is
101:55 great
101:55 we love it and you're gonna make this an
101:57 American business yeah absolutely okay
101:58 how much do you need boom boom boom
102:00 but we're gonna need a lot of help you
102:02 know we need a CFO we need various big
102:05 big heads to take over you may even need
102:07 to get a CEO at some point so he and I
102:09 can come down off the top floor and make
102:11 sure the technology works maybe certain
102:14 specialists in various areas right the
102:17 bank if they treated it like an
102:19 investment capital situation they would
102:22 simply find those individuals who also
102:25 are looking for work in that area and
102:27 build the best
102:29 team in the world to help us out and
102:33 then kaboom the business happens with
102:35 the best possible chance of American
102:39 citizen DNA they could be from other
102:41 countries but they're here they get the
102:43 benefits of being involved in the
102:44 project because they're brilliant but
102:48 that doesn't happen right what do they
102:50 get as a result of loaning us the money
102:53 maybe nothing but maybe there's just a
102:56 fee for the money well we're gonna loan
102:59 you ten million dollars what we want
103:02 back from that's a quarter of a million
103:03 dollars
103:04 it's a tiny fee for you to borrow the
103:07 money from us
103:07 maybe personal loans are managed
103:09 different than business loans right
103:11 personal loans it's really on the person
103:13 to make it work it's a high risk
103:15 situation perhaps with the business loan
103:17 maybe not so high risk but no matter
103:19 what if you went as an individual they
103:21 should be there to help you out so when
103:25 you see these situations in your head
103:27 you're like yeah man if we could just
103:28 clean things up we get this amazing
103:30 world oh my god we have so many examples
103:35 of that exact sort of thing in our
103:37 personal life's right if I just clean up
103:39 my house then I wouldn't have this
103:41 anxiety that is so dirty if I just
103:43 hunker down and study in school I get
103:47 good grades if I get good grades I get a
103:50 great edge a great degree and then I can
103:52 go off and get a great job but again
103:55 we're so screwed up in our priorities
104:01 overall right tell me why I think you
104:04 feel me on that I just wanted to throw
104:06 that out there let me know what you
104:08 think I do get a quite a few comments
104:11 lately which is sort of kind of
104:14 endearing and sort of kind of
104:15 frustrating at the same time where
104:16 someone will say something that I've
104:19 said in the video which must mean that
104:22 they've either heard it and didn't
104:24 realize they heard it from the video and
104:25 then they duplicate this profound
104:27 statement or they've said it before it
104:31 happened you know so it's kind of
104:33 interesting so with this particular one
104:34 hopefully you guys get to the end and if
104:37 you make it an early comment and you
104:39 find out the data is actually already in
104:40 the episode fully covered you can always
104:43 press the eight
104:43 your comment and change it and you know
104:47 within a certain amount of minutes I
104:48 think and update with matter better
104:50 thinking and more stuff that's out there
104:52 I think that the the quality of our
104:55 communication determines the value of
104:56 the show anyway if you have been a deep
105:00 thoughts radio calm please go
