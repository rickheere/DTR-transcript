00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts
00:34 on um this is the last day of
00:38 august it's actually fairly nice out
00:42 supposed to drop to like 64 but it's
00:44 probably about 67
00:46 68 fahrenheit
00:50 so i was at my um
00:55 i was at a gathering i should say with
00:57 some buddies of mine
01:00 one of my friends who's a psychologist
01:04 who i admire very much
01:07 he we get in conversations but that way
01:11 and i'm not sure exactly how this moment
01:13 occurred
01:15 but my vision of his face is the name
01:19 of this episode intellectual
01:24 horror this guy's
01:27 probably in his 50s early
01:31 been a psychologist for quite a while
01:34 and so he's he's he's also been all over
01:38 the place which is good he's done
01:41 normal practice he's done prisoners
01:44 he's done just a bunch of different
01:46 things over time
01:49 so we started talking and he is
01:52 extremely good at what he was taught to
01:54 do
01:57 he's also a guy that will talk about his
02:00 own flaws
02:01 so he's not holier than now so i'm
02:04 saying that in a good way
02:07 but we're having this conversation about
02:10 you know
02:11 what is consciousness thus
02:15 how would treatments for
02:19 idiosyncrasies and consciousness be
02:24 performed on a human being right
02:29 and one point he was making very quickly
02:31 was uh
02:33 usually if someone has an overt
02:37 behavior that is very
02:40 unbecoming negative to their existence
02:45 does harm to others or themselves
02:48 they usually almost categorically always
02:51 have something in their youth
02:53 than one very bad according to them
02:58 that could be that you know the family
03:00 had two children
03:01 one child responded really well to a
03:04 various
03:05 uh to a particular type of discipline
03:07 and the second child
03:09 for whatever reason was just horrified
03:12 and so thus they start a very imbalanced
03:16 spin and an analogy and therefore later
03:19 in life
03:20 collide into things break things and
03:23 become
03:24 sort of their worst enemy if not
03:27 society's
03:28 worst enemy and so you know
03:32 you know me right i'm doing all this
03:34 stuff about the soul and spirituality
03:36 and
03:37 various experiences of mine
03:40 so i'm always looking to get people
03:43 who don't believe in something to
03:45 comment on it
03:46 because they typically come from a very
03:49 genuine
03:50 position and you know there's a
03:52 knee-jerk response
03:54 and then we keep talking and then
03:55 there's usually a deeper response i'll
03:57 give an example have a very good friend
04:00 of mine that doesn't believe in ufos
04:04 which in turn means he doesn't believe
04:06 in aliens
04:08 we're sitting on this patio and i said
04:10 you know
04:11 okay i said what do you make of the
04:14 recent footage released by the pentagon
04:18 of ufos and the interviews with the
04:20 pilots in
04:22 100 years so ever since we started
04:24 flying in the air plus all that stuff
04:26 that goes back even further
04:28 i think i told you guys my grandmother
04:31 was born in 1912
04:32 said that by the time it was about 1920
04:36 she would see flying cigars in the sky
04:39 with her sister and when she told me
04:42 this
04:43 in the late 80s early 90s during a visit
04:47 she kind of told me and then looked at
04:49 me funny like
04:51 please don't think i'm crazy and she
04:54 never told
04:54 any story remotely like that every
04:57 single
04:58 other thing my grandmother ever told me
05:00 it was a straight meat and potatoes fact
05:02 about the family life whatever
05:04 never ever ventured out there
05:07 but she told me just very
05:09 matter-of-factly she says well you know
05:10 my sister and i used to watch
05:13 flying cigars big ships in
05:16 the sky leaving the trail now leaving a
05:19 trail is weird because you would think
05:20 that
05:21 a craft from another planet
05:25 or dimension or whatever wouldn't have
05:27 an exhaust
05:28 spout unless it was a man-made vehicle
05:33 and that this was like a more
05:34 sophisticated blimp thing
05:36 that then has ascended above that to
05:38 this day now looks like ufo
05:40 but anyway my buddy surprisingly said
05:44 oh i haven't seen any of that footage so
05:46 i'm looking at him about ufos you know
05:48 about the pentagon ufos
05:50 and so i said well
05:53 what about any ufo footage oh i just
05:55 haven't seen that much
05:57 it's kind of like a girl i dated who was
06:01 trying to cast me into hell
06:03 but had never read the bible one time in
06:04 her life
06:06 just like what you know
06:09 but the thing for my buddy was
06:12 i think initially he was concerned that
06:16 i was going to be like
06:18 patronizing him or sizing him up which
06:20 he knows i'm
06:21 i love him to death and i would never
06:23 ever do that he knows that
06:25 but it it's my estimation that he had a
06:28 pavlonian trigger that occurred where he
06:31 went into a defense
06:33 and then answered it one way and then i
06:35 let some time pass and then i said
06:38 hey you know the reason why i asked you
06:39 that ufo question is that
06:41 your answer and your description of what
06:44 these videos are because i showed them
06:45 the video
06:47 i shouldn't picture the video whatever i
06:49 said
06:50 if you can explain it
06:53 these unidentified flying vehicles that
06:57 all the way back to one of my buddies
06:58 whose father was a test pilot in the 40s
07:02 they see these things big giant crafts
07:04 they come up to ships you know and my
07:06 buddy's
07:07 father um pulled him over on his
07:10 death bed literally he made his daughter
07:13 leave the room and they're both in there
07:15 like
07:16 i assume they were in their 50s 50s or
07:19 60s
07:20 he made him leave the room and he just
07:22 just told his son you know he says look
07:24 this is what happened big 30-foot
07:27 approximate vehicle came up
07:29 beaming lights around the outer
07:30 perimeter
07:32 and i thought i was going to die because
07:33 the thing was toying with me and i
07:35 couldn't change the trajectory of my
07:36 plane
07:37 i don't know what plane he was flying so
07:39 long ago
07:41 and so i never really got an answer
07:44 other than my friend
07:45 kind of started to break his mold he was
07:48 starting to go well maybe
07:49 maybe there's something out there see it
07:51 wasn't exactly as black and white
07:55 so i digress to give you another example
07:58 of what i'm about to talk about
08:01 because we're seeing this a lot in a
08:04 bunch of different categories
08:06 and we need a word for it because we're
08:08 on the other side of the equation
08:11 we're believers in things that do not
08:13 have machines
08:15 that can track those things remember
08:19 i said an episode a long time ago
08:22 if they don't if scientists don't have a
08:24 way of identifying
08:26 in a machine and measuring something in
08:28 a machine
08:30 their feeble left brains say it doesn't
08:33 exist
08:35 and they don't i have never heard
08:39 one of these like legitimate scientists
08:42 ever leave the door open
08:44 it's always someone who's you know a
08:46 phenomenon person someone on the sci-fi
08:49 channel who has the open mind
08:53 uh a mufon person
08:55 [Music]
08:56 something like that so i
09:00 got my buddy he's right next to me known
09:02 him for
09:03 gosh four years so
09:06 and i said you know i'm kind of tired of
09:08 tiptoeing around other people's
09:10 closed minds you know so i have fun
09:12 everywhere i go when i have
09:13 conversations
09:14 and i just lean over to him he knows me
09:16 he knows i'm smart
09:18 you know just your average joe walking
09:20 in the door
09:21 and so i said well you know we're not
09:24 just
09:25 our body it's not just a bunch of
09:26 chemicals
09:28 of course i know i'm just speaking
09:30 heresy to this guy
09:33 and i said you know we are we do have
09:36 some sort of soul
09:37 we have something that goes on after
09:39 this life
09:41 and he's looking at me and he's not
09:43 changing his facial expression yet
09:46 i said well you know if you've had a
09:49 certain type of
09:50 experience in your lifetime it's
09:52 undeniable
09:53 then you can't be hanging on to this
09:56 chemical bag
09:57 theory now your vessel is something you
09:59 must take care of
10:01 because you can get hit on the head and
10:03 then you lose your faculties
10:05 whatever you are in symbiotic sense of
10:08 the soul attaching to
10:10 your body and creating a consciousness
10:12 right
10:14 essentially your mind is in the middle
10:16 between your soul
10:17 and your body just like flavor
10:20 is a combination of taste and smell if
10:23 you lose your taste or your smell
10:25 you lose flavor it's a it's a middle
10:28 frequency
10:29 of those two frequencies coming together
10:31 there's a lot of things about the mine
10:32 that work that way the 5g and 10 is
10:35 when high band is installed a couple
10:37 years from now
10:38 you will be mind controlled by a 5g
10:41 antenna should they want to it's because
10:44 they're gonna
10:45 sympathetically harmonize low frequency
10:48 and high frequency in the middle it
10:49 doesn't matter
10:50 which is our high band right now in 5g
10:53 the low and the high will modulate a
10:56 third frequency in your brain
10:57 which can make your vegetable can make
10:59 you
11:00 fearful happy sad whatever obtuse
11:03 emotion they want to give you
11:06 so i leaned on him with my
11:10 well disney story
11:13 and you're going to have to watch other
11:14 episodes of this is your first episode
11:15 which i doubt it is
11:17 but i said look four people involved
11:20 me being one of them three being
11:22 witnesses
11:24 came up to me told me where bob girl was
11:27 i went to the
11:28 exact spot on the map in my brain there
11:31 he was
11:32 i said look you don't get that
11:33 experience if we're just a bag of
11:35 chemicals
11:36 you just don't because it had context it
11:38 had guidance it was a lot more
11:40 dimensions than just
11:43 maybe psychically feeling him over there
11:48 plus there was all kinds of mechanisms
11:50 that had to go in place the ride was
11:52 broken on its maiden voyage so he went
11:54 off and rode matahorn and he stood
11:56 right where i was since boom right you
11:59 guys heard the story a thousand times
12:01 my grandmother telling me she was dead
12:03 boom two o'clock
12:05 twelve o'clock in the afternoon she's
12:06 hovering over my bed telling me she's
12:08 fine she's on the other side two hours
12:10 or so later my mom calls and says she's
12:12 passed and i had no idea she was in
12:14 hospice
12:16 okay so i tell him that
12:21 and he goes well have you ever heard of
12:23 uh
12:25 uh schizotypal
12:29 personalities i was like
12:32 no never heard that he was looking up
12:34 and he gets up
12:35 and he sits a little further away to
12:37 talk to some other friends
12:39 he's just like three or four feet from
12:40 me right
12:42 so schizotypal personality when you read
12:45 it
12:46 is really funny because it is
12:50 it is someone who
12:54 is very into conspiracies which that
12:56 makes him
12:57 feel comfortable we're going to get into
12:58 this and it also talks about
13:01 those individuals being very into the
13:04 paranormal
13:06 what i assume this mental condition
13:09 is truly aimed at are individuals
13:13 that have no witnesses for anything that
13:16 they ever claim
13:18 and so it's a way of becoming
13:21 important in the world because if you
13:23 don't feel important outside of those
13:26 those paradigms then you're going to
13:28 create them
13:29 you know you're going to see numbers and
13:31 things that you really aren't seeing
13:33 them in or you know over
13:35 um you're going to think of them in a
13:38 more significant way than they really
13:39 are
13:40 you're going to have a bunch of
13:41 paranormal experiences of which no one
13:43 else is going to witness
13:45 and conspiracies won't need the evidence
13:50 to be substantiated in your mind
13:53 again putting you on top of society
13:58 so i'm reading this and i'm i'm sort of
14:00 like oh i get it
14:02 i get it he knows that i definitely do
14:05 this show
14:05 i definitely have studied tons of stuff
14:08 tons of stuff that you've studied and
14:10 we've uncovered conspiracies
14:12 and again we don't know exactly who does
14:14 what we don't know why
14:16 and we don't even know completely how
14:18 they do everything we just know that the
14:20 bs stories that they give us
14:22 are physical and possibilities like 9 11
14:25 is a bunch of
14:26 impossible physics it just is the
14:28 aviation is impossible
14:30 planes crashing into towers
14:33 will not completely go into the tower a
14:35 bunch of debris is going to fall on the
14:37 outside of the tower the
14:38 tail section you know twenty two twenty
14:40 eight thousand pound engines and there's
14:42 four of them supposedly in two towers
14:44 they will eventually be found no matter
14:46 what happens right
14:48 titanium having a super high heat
14:51 threshold right
14:54 and 110 story building
14:57 the second building that fell was a
14:58 hundred stories that fell
15:00 and if it's trusts theory you know even
15:03 a
15:03 quarter second a tenth of a second is
15:05 going to make that falling down process
15:07 take almost a minute instead it takes
15:10 like uh
15:13 well it'd be yeah i've got about 50
15:14 seconds right it's half a second
15:16 pops quarter second takes 25 seconds no
15:19 it falls in six seconds
15:20 free fall because a bunch of bombs and
15:23 stuff were in there to
15:25 free it up first group of people on the
15:29 pile was controlled demolition family
15:31 then the cia then the firefighters than
15:33 everybody else okay
15:36 so i'm reading this on my cell phone and
15:38 i'm thinking
15:39 oh my gosh okay this is a feeble attempt
15:43 to walk away from empirical evidence
15:46 that we have
15:48 of all kinds of stuff near death
15:51 experiences where people see things and
15:53 come back
15:53 kids that are born that know
15:56 where they who they were and where they
15:58 were what families they were part of
16:01 there's kids all over the world from
16:02 mexico and england
16:05 taking their family members as children
16:07 to these other locations and they may
16:09 not have everything correct but they got
16:10 a
16:11 so much correct it's ridiculous anything
16:13 correct this specific
16:16 if he even points at one if they see
16:17 there's 10 family members the little boy
16:19 goes
16:20 her name's jessica and if her name's
16:22 jessica and he gets all the other names
16:23 wrong
16:25 that's still significant a lot of these
16:27 kids will get like five or six things
16:29 correct
16:30 if not everything correct
16:33 so in the room he is actually pitching a
16:37 friend of ours
16:38 on a business idea so i didn't have you
16:40 know 100
16:43 you know his attention so he was trying
16:44 to like stick with this other thing and
16:46 i don't know why he came over to talk to
16:47 me at all but um
16:51 i finally just kind of got his attention
16:52 i said john i said
16:54 the disney story i said it's witnessed
16:56 by three other people
16:59 this isn't me making stuff up
17:02 i was what are the odds that i dreamed
17:04 that my grandmother's
17:05 dead or that she came to me i didn't
17:07 dream it was like a daytime thing
17:09 and then my mom calls me two and a half
17:11 hours later so
17:12 dude this isn't just some me making it
17:16 up
17:17 right i've always felt very confident
17:18 with myself i've got a million reasons
17:20 why i
17:21 feel special in the world i don't need
17:23 anything else
17:26 and this is where i got
17:30 a very intellectual guy i don't know how
17:34 smart the guy is but i am i'm gonna
17:36 assume he's he's very very
17:38 got a phd and he just looked at me
17:42 and it was like it was intellectual
17:46 horror on his face which is very
17:49 interesting
17:50 it's not like this scary face that you
17:52 and i might have someone goes boo
17:54 it's more like a guy that is on the very
17:58 precipice
18:00 of caving as a human being
18:04 because this paradigm shift for his mind
18:06 is
18:07 going to undo so much of his authority
18:12 for his teachings instead of what you
18:15 and i do
18:16 which is to find a whole new frontier i
18:18 mean imagine if any one of us
18:21 had a phd in psychology and we had an
18:24 open mind
18:25 to the soul with these empirical moments
18:28 and
18:29 as a psychologist with the phd we've got
18:31 personal experiences
18:33 that prove there's life after death
18:37 it's not all horrible etc etc
18:41 we could then take the toolbox of all
18:44 the behavioral sciences that he learned
18:46 and attach it to or attempt to attach it
18:49 to
18:50 these other experiences and then come up
18:53 with the third science
18:54 right you got bf skinner you know
18:58 trumping
19:00 now what's really funny in the academic
19:01 realm
19:03 is that you know freud was a neurologist
19:08 and so you know he was he was a very
19:11 open-minded dude he was coming up with
19:13 things that when he was coming up with
19:15 him
19:16 you know the id the character and the
19:17 persona plus a ton of other stuff
19:21 he um
19:25 wasn't well received initially and by
19:28 some folks
19:29 never ever received well and what's
19:32 really sad about it is
19:34 we have this natural barrier
19:38 of a mix between
19:42 my my two friends okay
19:45 again i thank my buddy here on the patio
19:48 that i asked the ufo question to
19:51 went into a knee-jerk defense
19:54 position his face even changed and i'm
19:56 not even sure he was aware
19:58 that his face changed because his face
20:00 changed in a way that was sort of like
20:02 fu you know like don't make me go this
20:06 route you're asking me this question
20:07 because
20:08 you think i'm stupid because i don't
20:10 believe in ufos
20:12 which is completely the opposite because
20:14 my friend is so smart
20:16 and so well experienced this other
20:18 friend of mine
20:20 i really wanted to know it's like you
20:24 one you have to ingest the material to
20:26 see if you think it's just
20:28 spacecraft made by man now where he
20:31 ended up
20:32 was that he said i'm thinking it's
20:35 probably something that we've made here
20:36 on earth
20:37 it's just secret now one of the pilots
20:40 that took
20:41 one of the key shots that's been sent
20:43 around the world
20:44 the one over the ocean or the moving
20:47 really fast and it's just on some
20:49 targeting camera
20:50 he commented specifically on the fact
20:53 that he goes
20:54 he goes if this is man-made he goes then
20:56 there's a propulsion system out there
20:58 that we're completely unaware of
21:00 but he also alluded the fact that this
21:02 propulsion system and this type of
21:04 sighting goes
21:04 back you know 100 well probably 80 years
21:08 back to the late 40s 1940s
21:13 and so he's like it's not like it was
21:15 made yesterday or
21:16 last 30 years and suddenly the air force
21:19 is flying around this wild vehicle
21:22 but there again i'm going to allude back
21:25 to my episode that was about the
21:27 threshold of intelligence
21:30 which goes to the point that when you
21:32 think about certain things
21:34 no matter how adventurous your mind is
21:38 there seems to be at least for me this
21:42 weird pushback
21:45 and it's it's almost like
21:48 it's almost like the first time you find
21:50 the threshold in your mind for instance
21:52 you try to think of space and it's
21:54 infinity you're trying to think of
21:55 what's heaven-like or
21:58 [Music]
21:59 i don't know one of these little areas
22:02 the first thing
22:03 i experience is sort of metaphorically
22:05 like a wall
22:07 you try to imagine out there in space
22:10 you try to imagine other planets and
22:12 other civilizations like
22:13 what would a foreign alien city look
22:17 like
22:18 wouldn't that be one of the most amazing
22:20 images you could possibly see a
22:21 sophisticated
22:23 society that's perhaps around our level
22:26 maybe even their prehistoric
22:29 upbringings like they're kind of cave
22:31 versions of what we were
22:32 but it's them instead a total different
22:34 biology
22:36 and then of course the super wild
22:39 version which is
22:40 where does
22:43 a ufo land like where would it go
22:46 so it leaves earth and it goes back to
22:48 its own planet what does that place look
22:50 like
22:51 you know we've had amazing conceptual
22:53 artists in hollywood
22:54 generate one futuristic city after
22:57 another
22:57 so the benefit in 2020 is that we have
23:01 a ton of reference in our mind but would
23:04 the real thing look anything like these
23:06 conceptual sketches or would it be so
23:08 amazing would blow our minds to pieces
23:10 right
23:12 but the second tier that i experienced
23:14 is a pushback
23:17 which is i am pushing and pushing and
23:19 pushing to go
23:21 you know get out of my way i'm gonna
23:23 think about this
23:24 and sometimes i can get through but a
23:27 lot of times i get this like
23:29 slap it really feels like that
23:32 and i can only say it's metaphorical
23:34 because i'm not being physically
23:36 harmed or maneuvered or manipulated in
23:39 this world
23:42 when you try to conceive of heaven
23:45 because this was the conversation we
23:46 were
23:47 having on the patio a few days ago
23:51 and just said you know what do you think
23:52 man uh
23:54 i said because my buddy is a very
23:57 literal bible
23:58 person and he's like i just take it all
24:00 literal
24:01 and i was like oh okay so i said uh
24:04 do you think the world's going to end
24:05 and mankind on our earth is going oh
24:08 definitely man
24:09 and then he cites sort of pseudoscience
24:11 which is the
24:12 sun swelling up and swallowing all the
24:15 planets which
24:17 most likely will never occur unless the
24:19 electricity
24:20 itself inside the sun dies off somehow
24:23 even though it's being
24:25 constantly replenished by the universe
24:27 itself
24:29 and so i said okay so god this infinite
24:32 being
24:33 has no beginning has no end
24:36 which i tend to believe whatever central
24:38 consciousness
24:40 exists whatever this place is man
24:42 doesn't even matter if you think we're
24:43 in a matrix because again above that
24:45 there would be their world and then
24:46 their world is the turtles all the way
24:48 down who knows right
24:52 and i said so
24:55 in in respect to infinity
24:58 when you have something that's
25:00 infinitely large if you just study
25:01 douglas adams head checkers out of the
25:02 galaxy
25:03 infinite perspective vortex
25:07 any finite moment in time
25:10 becomes infinitely insignificant as as
25:13 the illusion of time continues
25:16 because it's an infinitely small thing
25:19 compared to
25:19 an infinitely large thing if it's finite
25:23 infinitely small an infinite dot on an
25:26 infinite dot infinitely small
25:28 it's douglas adams so what would be the
25:32 significance for god
25:34 making us right this won't necessarily
25:36 be a god episode or anything but
25:38 this is where we were in the
25:39 conversation the other day and i want to
25:41 share it with you
25:43 because i asked my buddy and because
25:45 it's interesting is that
25:46 you get people who have really read the
25:48 bible my buddies
25:50 read the bible a lot and he was raised
25:52 in a very religious family
25:54 he's in his uh mid 50s and he's reading
25:57 it again
25:59 and he's sort of like the
26:02 preachers from my hometown kind of gets
26:05 a little cantankerous
26:06 that he thinks questioned too much it's
26:08 just black and white
26:10 everything's just black and white
26:11 revelations is not
26:14 an analogy or a metaphor it is literal
26:18 very tough for some of us to kind of
26:21 even process the data once it goes that
26:23 literal right
26:26 but i said did god make man because god
26:28 was bored
26:31 he says i don't know so that's the best
26:33 answer you give me all night
26:34 you don't know it's good of seems like
26:38 he did
26:40 and because he's very opposed to
26:43 reincarnation and one of the interesting
26:46 things
26:46 i finally kind of drug out of the
26:48 conversation which i want to
26:50 share with you is
26:51 [Music]
26:53 i said so let me get this straight
26:55 according to your belief system
26:58 which is generally american christianity
27:02 it is blasphemous to say that i would
27:05 live
27:06 a finite life down here in this
27:08 infinitely small moment in time which is
27:10 the lifespan of humanity
27:13 and i'm gonna die and this magical thing
27:15 happens on some judgment day where it's
27:17 like a total marvel comic jesus comes
27:19 down and just
27:20 [ __ ] rips the place up right and then
27:22 poof evil people go to hell and good
27:24 people go to heaven
27:26 so now i'm in heaven and what's heaven
27:29 like and he had nothing
27:32 he just said oh just be wonderful i mean
27:34 again it's just the old classic
27:36 zero definition definition so i said
27:40 okay
27:40 no surprise to me i've heard that before
27:42 but i said
27:43 so now if i'm in heaven can i just do
27:45 anything i wanted to
27:47 oh yeah sure totally okay good
27:50 so so i said do you think i could
27:51 probably go fishing with my
27:52 grandfather's
27:54 oh yeah do you think i could hang with
27:56 elvis yeah do you think i could
27:58 get on stage and rock a concert to all
28:00 the music that i wrote to people that
28:02 want to hear it
28:03 and have that experience i never had on
28:05 earth oh yeah totally
28:08 so i said where's the sin
28:10 [Music]
28:12 and telling god look i love the fact
28:16 you've created these two paradigms trust
28:17 me now i'm going to chill out in heaven
28:18 for a little while right
28:21 but instead of doing everything up here
28:25 and some ethereal body thing our
28:27 ethereal body or some spiritual body
28:30 i want to go back down to earth and be
28:32 born again
28:33 in fact i want to pick the time i want
28:35 to pick my parents
28:37 maybe i'll get born exactly the same era
28:40 maybe even go back a few years maybe i
28:42 want to live in the 50s
28:44 just to see what it was like maybe i
28:45 want to go to war and see what that's
28:47 like
28:48 maybe i want to become some some career
28:51 that i never had before
28:52 but in an early age so like a spielberg
28:55 type character whatever
28:59 some dudes are going to want to be
29:00 chicks some chicks are going to want to
29:01 be dudes you know
29:04 do you think god's going to go no you
29:07 know
29:08 i don't think there's any sin doing it
29:11 up there
29:11 versus doing it down here down down
29:13 there versus up there it's the same
29:15 thing
29:15 it's just a bunch of dreams right
29:18 but we have this all over the world
29:20 don't we
29:22 every form of science when people get
29:25 indoctrinated and it's
29:26 i'm going to say this is really
29:30 a left brain moment in time now everyone
29:33 can have a little bit of this
29:34 probably but i think your right brain
29:37 people
29:38 if they have the intellectual look of
29:40 horror
29:42 i would think that that would be for a
29:44 split second
29:45 before it becomes an intellectual moment
29:48 of utter and complete excitement
29:50 that a new frontier has been uncovered
29:53 in conversation
29:54 or whatever but your left brain people
29:58 what psychologists also call stringers
30:01 the groupers are right brain people
30:03 stringers need to read everything from
30:05 start to finish everything's a checklist
30:07 love is a checklist relationships are
30:09 just checklist they do very good in
30:11 school
30:11 not so great in life your groupers just
30:14 need the gist of everything
30:16 they don't do so great in school do
30:19 fabulous in life
30:21 because life comes at you randomly right
30:25 love is a very deep emotional experience
30:28 for a group
30:30 for a left-brained person they almost
30:32 don't understand love at all
30:34 they know they love things but they just
30:36 don't
30:37 understand why the rest of us can write
30:39 a romance novel
30:41 uh a ballad a movie a rom-com or
30:45 anything a drama because they don't have
30:50 i don't mean to create a have and have
30:52 not situation what i want to do is what
30:54 the egyptians do which is to bring the
30:55 two hemispheres together over the course
30:57 of your life
30:58 you're born with more of a left brain
31:01 then
31:02 your journey is to go right if you're
31:03 born with a right brain your journey is
31:05 to go more left
31:06 to bring it in total harmony dead center
31:11 but i know that the recent events has
31:13 brought out a lot of this
31:16 intellectual horror but in general
31:22 you know well currently i do want to
31:24 digress for one second
31:26 currently the game is a bunch of people
31:28 that have been wrong for the majority of
31:30 their life
31:30 because they research nothing and know
31:32 everything are trying to use current day
31:34 events to be right
31:36 more than ever to force those that are
31:40 actually
31:40 more informed than them to capitulate
31:43 and get on one knee
31:45 for something that is completely
31:46 incorrect and i don't mean to
31:49 reference the blm thing it's just
31:53 speaking metaphorically
31:57 scientific data that is completely
31:59 messed up
32:01 and i just want to say here there's been
32:04 a great victory
32:05 on august 28th the cdc released a report
32:09 that said only six percent of
32:11 all cases of people supposedly dying
32:13 from
32:14 covid have actually just died of pure
32:17 coping
32:18 the other 94 percent died with
32:20 pre-existing conditions and most likely
32:22 because of the pre-existing conditions
32:24 you'll see that on the news
32:28 but you'll you'll see people and i see
32:30 this a lot with older
32:32 gentlemen i don't think i've ever seen
32:34 this in a female but then again
32:36 i don't have a circuit in my life where
32:38 i talk to older women anymore
32:40 because my grandparents are gone my
32:42 grandmothers are gone
32:44 and thank god no this was around when
32:46 they were alive but i had to
32:49 feel angst or anything but the one thing
32:53 that starts to occur
32:55 in older gentlemen is that life becomes
32:58 a script
33:01 and that script is sort of in their
33:06 later age depending on how they have
33:08 treated their body again i think people
33:10 that
33:11 drink a lot of alcohol you know again
33:15 no one's got the balls to tell people
33:18 who are alcoholics
33:20 the following information and again
33:24 there's so many functional alcoholics
33:27 and borderline alcoholics that need to
33:29 hear this because
33:30 what ends up happening and i suggest you
33:32 repeat this to anyone you love who's
33:33 drinking a lot
33:34 don't chastise and just say you know
33:36 there's just something you need to know
33:37 if you're going to continue drinking you
33:39 need to know this right
33:42 alcohol destroys the brain cells
33:45 it does it destroys your organs too but
33:47 it definitely destroys your brain cells
33:49 that need absolutely perfectly
33:51 oxygenated blood
33:53 now full disclosure i do have a drink
33:55 every once in a while
33:56 but it's nothing and i do not remotely
33:59 get close to getting drunk
34:00 ever okay
34:04 but i'm doing it to myself too but
34:06 there's you know there's like a little
34:07 bit of moderation your brain can rebuild
34:09 things what have you
34:10 you do shows like this and your brain
34:11 can't atrophy
34:14 at least as easily but
34:18 your brain ceases to function properly
34:21 at the most minute fractional percentage
34:24 every single time you drink
34:26 especially if you get drunk
34:29 and what will end up happening is is
34:31 that the subject who's drinking too much
34:36 subliminally notices that the brain
34:38 isn't working that well
34:39 over time it becomes conscious to them
34:42 it's so bad they can't remember anything
34:45 they just have issues
34:47 and so they drink more
34:50 to solve the problem but they are
34:52 getting older in their mind they're told
34:54 all these excuses why they're
34:55 losing their mind it's
34:58 because of the substance abuse could be
35:01 just medicine abuse who knows right
35:05 and so what i have seen in one of my
35:07 friends
35:09 who was a closet alcoholic i mean
35:12 obviously he still is but he stopped
35:13 drinking
35:15 because it all caught up with him he
35:17 ended up having a
35:18 pretty bad stroke so he kicked kicked it
35:22 out so now he's repairing
35:23 he's in full repair mode and i've never
35:25 heard him be more elusive than recently
35:27 which is beautiful so the repair can
35:28 happen fairly quickly
35:30 but depending on how much you drink your
35:32 veins aren't ready for fully
35:34 developed blood you can actually die
35:35 from that transition if you go
35:37 too cold turkey anyway
35:41 when i see this get to a point
35:45 i see the repetitive scripting happen
35:49 and these people will tell me the same
35:51 complex story
35:52 over and over and over again and it's
35:54 it's in very subject matters
35:57 might be cosmology they have a bunch of
35:58 stuff that just recently studied
36:00 could be their life story in a
36:03 particular decade or something like that
36:06 and they just it is almost word for word
36:09 it's
36:09 this chronology is exactly the same and
36:11 then i did this and then she said this
36:13 and then i went here and this happened
36:14 it's all identical
36:17 but anytime you ever try to share that
36:18 information with someone who's super
36:20 intelligent
36:21 you will get the look of intellectual
36:23 [ __ ]
36:25 don't you mess with my
36:28 bizarre interpretation of existence
36:31 i know i'm spiting myself i know i'm my
36:34 worst enemy but don't you
36:36 say anything it's very um
36:40 if you ever tried to rationalize with
36:42 the total drunk
36:44 you'll definitely see this face super
36:46 quick but you'll typically write it off
36:48 when they're drunk
36:50 the fascinating thing is when they're
36:51 totally sober maybe they're not even a
36:53 drinker
36:55 everyone probably has something where
36:58 you kind of come up against a point
37:00 where you're like
37:01 what you know like you're really pushing
37:04 my buttons man
37:06 my brain doesn't go there i think most
37:09 listeners of this show probably have
37:12 would have a hard time finding their
37:14 threshold if there even is one
37:17 i do think you can achieve a point where
37:19 your mind is completely open
37:22 and it's just through experience but
37:25 part of the underlining fabric
37:27 of this intellectual horror is
37:30 the notion of some sort of systematic
37:33 loyalty
37:34 there's a system of belief and one
37:36 becomes loyal to it
37:38 it becomes a faux
37:41 definition of their character
37:46 i believe this therefore i am this type
37:48 of person
37:50 now in a sort of societal
37:53 mechanism most of us would who were
37:56 loyal to this show are folks that
37:58 believe in common law
38:00 mind your own business don't bother me i
38:02 won't bother you the best of my ability
38:04 let me know if i am bothering you i'll
38:06 stop i'll let you know if you're
38:07 bothering me
38:08 please stop if you are don't force crap
38:11 on me
38:12 right and when you try to
38:16 take away that belief system
38:20 but you're really not trying to take it
38:21 away you're really just trying to
38:23 clarify
38:25 okay what if someone told you an absurd
38:27 thing like i don't believe that the
38:29 color red exists
38:31 maybe they're colorblind whatever and
38:34 then you're like well okay
38:36 i respect you my friend but i see
38:39 this other color that's red and there's
38:42 a bunch of us that see
38:43 it so you might get some cards out
38:47 okay this is what i think is blue so i
38:49 think is orange but what is this color
38:51 you're holding up red
38:53 and they may look at it go i don't see
38:56 any color on that besides the background
38:58 color
38:59 of the piece of paper you may find out
39:01 they're colorblind who knows
39:04 but if for whatever reason you could get
39:07 them
39:07 to see blood or something and they're
39:10 like reacting to it in a pavlonian way
39:13 right a lot of people see blood they
39:15 faint
39:16 what could you imagine someone denying
39:18 the color red exists
39:20 and you just take a buck knife and you
39:22 just cut your hand and you just bleed
39:24 right in front of them
39:25 and they just start to faint or puke or
39:27 whatever it is and you're like oh
39:29 you said you couldn't see red this is
39:31 red
39:32 and that triggered your brain to pass
39:34 out
39:37 intellectual horror is the next thing
39:39 you'll see
39:41 and i'll give you an example
39:45 that a group of you will
39:48 smile and you're like yeah
39:52 he's got you another part of you will
39:56 just have intellectual horror
40:01 about 2015
40:04 the flat of flat earth movement
40:07 hit overdrive eric dubay releases his
40:10 series of videos and then
40:12 internet explodes all kinds of user
40:14 groups come around
40:18 they're showing you that all the photos
40:19 of earth are all bogus they all have
40:22 anomalies they show you the interview
40:23 with the guy from nasa created the last
40:26 blue marble shot in the last 10 years
40:29 here and he said
40:30 so it has to be a composite of a bunch
40:33 of other photographs right and he says
40:34 yeah it has to be it's a composite it
40:36 has to be
40:38 a nasa employee right no one who's so
40:41 sure it's round
40:42 has ever been in space right but they
40:45 certainly know
40:47 so when a ball earth person hears
40:51 this flat earth movement
40:55 there is sort of like this intellectual
40:58 [ __ ]
40:58 only when okay you tell them look
41:03 you're so sure it's round prove it to me
41:06 go get your proof
41:08 right i'll take the blue marble shot
41:10 from apollo 17 and prove to you the
41:12 black sea was all screwed up
41:14 then they fixed it later on i'll put the
41:17 i'll put the image in the video in case
41:19 you haven't seen it
41:20 it's astounding it proves we didn't go
41:22 to the moon for one thing
41:23 but they also faked that shot
41:27 again the last one made was fully
41:29 composited by a bunch of satellite
41:31 photographs or high altitude plane
41:33 photographs and
41:34 the kid admitted in the recording right
41:38 so you think you don't have one and then
41:40 someone nails you
41:43 it might be indeed round it's just
41:46 you can't prove it because we're stuck
41:48 here on the surface
41:51 what would the uh what would our faces
41:54 look like on earth
41:56 if the second coming actually occurred
42:01 we're starting up with this guy and who
42:04 knows what the hell that's going to look
42:05 like
42:05 again there's this two different stories
42:07 there's
42:08 there's a thousand years of bliss on
42:11 earth
42:12 and then jesus takes all the souls up
42:14 then there's one where it's the opposite
42:17 the souls go first and then there's i
42:19 don't know thousands of bad stuff i
42:21 don't know
42:21 some weird thing jesus i don't think
42:25 ever said what he was gonna do
42:26 right but here we are angels start
42:30 falling out of the sky
42:33 i assume they might even break the sound
42:34 barrier it's going to be wild right if
42:36 that ever happened
42:37 and then people like me will just be
42:41 sort of like oh my god it's really
42:43 happening
42:44 but for at least a few seconds i'm gonna
42:46 have
42:48 this luca i'm your father moment
42:52 where my whole life is gonna flash in
42:54 front of me and be like
42:56 i wonder what's gonna happen to me you
42:57 know was it good enough
43:00 because this marvel comic probably just
43:03 came true
43:05 what's interesting about the my buddy
43:07 the other day
43:10 with the schizotypal
43:16 personality wanted me to look up
43:19 he was not able to say a single
43:22 sentence after i pushed it on him and i
43:25 just said look you don't get to have
43:26 this little
43:27 pawn off situation where you're like hey
43:30 uh i got this condition and a piece of
43:32 paper
43:33 therefore you're nuts and i'm not nuts
43:36 because that's what's most important to
43:38 him he's right
43:40 i'm wrong he's saying i'm insane
43:46 isn't it interesting that the more you
43:48 become observant of reality and willing
43:50 to acknowledge
43:51 all that is unexplained the other
43:54 group of people however big or small
43:56 they are
43:58 they are heretic now i'm going to give a
44:01 little example
44:04 which if it were true you would know why
44:05 they were doing but the witch hunts
44:08 the witch hunts that have happened over
44:09 time a couple hundred years ago with
44:12 superstition was the way
44:13 the world was run people said they were
44:16 witches
44:17 certain friends of theirs and then those
44:20 friends
44:21 defect against them you know all this
44:23 bad stuff is happening
44:24 because the witch and without
44:27 confirmation
44:29 in some cases people were tied to stakes
44:32 and burned alive
44:34 to rid the world of evil
44:38 all right well today we may not
44:42 have people that call themselves witches
44:43 but we definitely have some
44:45 super mega evil rich
44:49 powerful people in this world so we
44:52 might um
44:55 might just be one witch hunt shy of that
44:57 group of people
44:58 being removed from the planet but what
45:00 are they attempting to do the entire
45:02 time
45:03 made positive negative negative positive
45:06 so that you attack
45:07 their competition the folks that are
45:10 trying to keep them
45:12 from being all powerful all the time
45:17 so what's the next stage after
45:18 intellectual war occurs in someone's
45:20 mind
45:22 well my friend was smart enough
45:26 not to contribute something idiotic to
45:29 the conversation
45:30 perhaps he didn't have anything to say
45:32 perhaps he was
45:34 trying to get back in this pitch that he
45:35 was trying to do
45:38 but what do we see most often
45:43 we see violence erupt
45:46 from a human being and why is that
45:50 why did they turn to violence i was just
45:53 watching an old doctor who episode
45:55 peter davidson and
45:58 the two of these characters uh turlow
46:00 was talking to marissa
46:02 or something like that or teresa
46:04 whatever name is and uh
46:06 he was from another planet spread head
46:08 kid talking his brunette woman
46:11 and he's just matter of fact you know
46:13 well you know
46:14 this isn't going to go the way you think
46:15 it's going to go and then she starts
46:17 shouting
46:17 he goes why is it that earth people from
46:19 earth every time they hear something
46:21 they don't want to hear they start
46:22 shouting as if that's going to
46:24 get them their way
46:27 well if you're probably at least 40
46:30 years old you have at least one if not
46:32 more experiences where you've actually
46:33 done that you've raised your voice
46:35 you're the person cowards down
46:37 [Music]
46:38 and you got your way and later on maybe
46:41 you felt guilty
46:42 that you used that tactic now some of
46:45 that is intellectually
46:47 intentional meaning you've seen it
46:49 before
46:50 and you're going to play this game and
46:51 you yell and scream and you get your way
46:54 and in the other side of the game is
46:57 you're just pavlonian doing it it's just
46:58 a trigger boom
47:01 we're seeing this all over the world
47:02 aren't we
47:04 now to get to the 2020 level
47:10 we have a tremendous amount of violence
47:12 going on in liberal cities in the united
47:14 states of america
47:16 almost every single day someone is
47:19 getting shot and killed
47:20 if we miss a day then within that week
47:24 the days that we missed three four five
47:27 people are killed
47:28 on the day that it starts back up again
47:30 thus accounting for the days that we've
47:31 missed
47:33 all based on liberal agendas gone wrong
47:35 because they always go wrong
47:36 unfortunately right no one in my opinion
47:39 just if you're
47:40 a newcomer should be extreme left
47:43 and no one should be extreme right we
47:45 live directly in harmony and center
47:48 if you're a balanced human being so we
47:52 want to be progressive but we also want
47:53 to keep what's working
47:56 until we find a beautiful replacement
47:58 for that type of thing
47:59 do we have issues hell yeah we got
48:01 issues
48:04 i won't go down that path too much
48:08 but what is happening to humanity and i
48:11 know that you guys know this on a
48:12 subconscious level some of you know it
48:14 on a conscious level
48:15 but i want to make sure that it rises
48:17 out of your subconscious it goes
48:18 straight to your
48:20 you know forefront of your projection of
48:22 thinking
48:25 which is that everyone has triggers
48:29 we have this word that we're tired of
48:31 hearing trigger
48:33 triggered whatever
48:36 at the same time i want you to learn the
48:37 science behind it because it is the
48:39 mechanism by which
48:40 it's being used these tactics are being
48:43 used against you
48:46 every single human being
48:50 i would think i would say minus maybe a
48:53 tibetan monk that's completely
48:55 enlightened
48:56 has triggers and they come in all
49:00 different sizes and shapes
49:02 some triggers are annoying some triggers
49:04 will make you angry
49:06 so you'll you'll use bad language
49:09 towards someone or something
49:11 and then the other one is the trigger
49:13 that will make you
49:15 jump to an actual physical activity on
49:18 the outside
49:19 a violent act and we're all
49:22 guilty of this okay for me you can talk
49:26 about a pedophile
49:27 there you go dead just you know
49:30 see you later i don't want to pay for
49:32 you in jail i don't think your sentence
49:34 should be short
49:35 i think it should just go but then we
49:37 have to come up with very rigid
49:38 definitions of what true pedophilia is
49:41 right so what's happening
49:44 is that the architects of the narratives
49:47 are literally specifically picking
49:52 folks in my opinion that have a very
49:55 short fuse
49:56 to their intellectual horror moments
49:59 these triggers are being developed out
50:02 of perhaps
50:03 real events in their life right if you
50:06 talk to
50:06 anyone in america who's black they will
50:09 have experienced
50:10 some sort of discrimination so what the
50:13 narratives are doing
50:14 is sort of intellectually pushing them
50:16 into the corner
50:17 and then showing them the most horrific
50:19 triggers they could possibly experience
50:22 to get them to pop and go violent
50:26 because you have to when you're backed
50:27 into a corner that is if you're really
50:30 back to two quarter
50:33 then there's that point where you've had
50:35 enough you're not going to take it
50:36 anymore
50:38 and you explode however you
50:41 explode sometimes those can be
50:45 beautiful moments you're tired of being
50:47 poor
50:48 so you explode and you take your life
50:51 into complete control
50:53 you find out what you love and you go
50:54 you know what i'm not doing any of this
50:56 crap i don't like anymore
50:57 if i become homeless but i do what i
50:59 love
51:01 so be it and in almost every single case
51:04 when you make that sacrifice
51:06 you'll find money and success and
51:08 recognition
51:09 and what you love be on the first day
51:14 but it'll happen eventually
51:18 we want to be at a point in my opinion
51:22 where we cannot be triggered easily
51:26 because we've already taken inventory of
51:29 the internals of our mind and we have
51:31 found our weak points
51:33 and then we we go
51:36 exercise those moments ourself
51:40 this is one reason why i think that
51:41 organized religion
51:43 does more harm than good in some cases
51:46 when it comes to these
51:47 your easily manipulated moments now on
51:51 the flip side it's beautiful is you
51:52 learn
51:52 morals and you learn rules and society
51:55 starts to actually
51:57 go up in the world
52:01 think about how many celebrities are
52:03 absolutely
52:04 filthy pieces of crap that are still the
52:07 most famous people
52:09 and if they so much as have a demon's
52:11 bond child we have to sit and look at it
52:13 in the news
52:16 like i don't want to know about this i
52:18 don't want to know that the satanist
52:20 just had a kid
52:22 but we do share the world with other
52:24 people so no matter how much you try to
52:28 quarantine yourself or get through your
52:30 thresholds you're going to be surprised
52:31 every once
52:32 aren't you
52:35 now some folks god bless them they live
52:38 in bliss
52:39 and they never once questioned reality
52:44 they never once wake up in the morning
52:46 and go
52:47 what is this place i mean really
52:50 what is this where the hell are we
52:54 what the hell are we i mean even if you
52:56 were to say
52:57 okay all official science is completely
52:59 true
53:00 and we're in a we're a dust spec on the
53:03 dust speck in the middle of this
53:05 infinite bowl of
53:06 specks well is there a border
53:10 to the universe i mean is there a wall
53:12 out there somewhere are we am i'm in a
53:14 bubble
53:15 am i in a shoe box what am i using and
53:17 then
53:19 where did it come from where all the
53:20 mathematics come from that sustain us
53:22 day to day
53:24 well out of all the math when does math
53:26 equal love
53:28 how do i explain all these paranormal
53:30 experiences i've actually had
53:34 you have to understand i would say
53:39 2006 where
53:43 2000 year 2000 this is prior to having
53:46 any
53:48 significant experience i did have the
53:49 alien thing but that might be explained
53:51 by
53:52 proximity to my girlfriend although i
53:55 think that would happen a lot
53:58 where an alien told me it was in my
53:59 christmas present he was right
54:01 and i already thought i knew what it was
54:03 and i'd never seen what the object was
54:04 blah blah blah
54:06 okay
54:09 i never thought i would ever actually
54:12 see
54:13 any type of apparition a relative coming
54:16 back from the dead
54:18 remember houdini houdini the magician
54:21 made a pact with his wife that he would
54:24 attempt every
54:25 means possible of coming back and
54:28 visiting his wife
54:29 after death and she never reported him
54:32 ever coming back
54:35 all right well he's a clever guy isn't
54:37 he
54:38 how many clever people have passed i
54:41 mean really clever people
54:43 nikola tesla oh my god take nicola
54:47 tesla's brain and push it into heaven
54:48 where he's got plenty of time to think
54:51 okay um
54:53 [Music]
54:56 what's stopping that guy from being in
54:59 heaven and going okay
55:00 i understand how the fabric of the
55:01 universe works i'm a soul now
55:04 uh he's a believer in ether so ether is
55:07 the universe
55:09 all i need to do as as tesla so he's
55:12 speaking
55:12 i'm speaking on his behalf i just got a
55:16 vortex and ether get it to spin maybe
55:18 just nudge here and nudge there and then
55:20 i get light to show up in a room
55:22 when someone is thinking about me and
55:24 then poof they know it's me
55:27 tons of people in this world me included
55:30 and all my friends i've ever talked to
55:33 secretly we don't want to admit it but
55:35 we've asked relatives to give us a sign
55:38 to do something in the room they gotta
55:40 make a light bulb go on
55:42 just become light in the room don't have
55:44 to look like grandma or grandpa or
55:46 anybody
55:46 just do something an apparition a cloud
55:49 of light
55:50 close the door flick the light on
55:52 whatever just do something
55:54 nothing ever happens if something
55:57 happens it's when you least expect it
56:00 okay and that's just not been my
56:02 personal experience nothing ever happens
56:06 okay the health of these
56:09 mental exercises for your mind
56:12 is what you become incredibly open
56:16 open-minded two very little
56:20 can surprise you to the point where you
56:22 go into shock
56:24 i think i said on episodes like three or
56:27 four seasons ago
56:29 that uh
56:33 one of the things that i had realized i
56:35 think when the internet was
56:36 around 2000 or so and i get these sicko
56:38 sites out there
56:40 i had people tell me stories
56:44 in fact it was a story about uh told to
56:46 me by my friend's
56:47 father and i was probably about
56:51 19 or so he told me the story and he
56:52 said you know that he had come upon an
56:54 accident
56:55 on the um the 101
56:59 just outside of camarillo on what's
57:01 called the grade which is this big
57:02 mountain you have to go up and over
57:04 get to la and it was a bad bad accident
57:09 and i mean super bad
57:11 there's some dismemberment going on okay
57:15 and he wanted to help he was one of the
57:17 first people to get on the site but he
57:18 wasn't the first and so
57:20 he saw a body in a car
57:24 that was missing
57:27 the top of the body okay and he wanted
57:30 to cover it up
57:31 because there were other members there
57:34 uh
57:35 that person's family and you want them
57:37 to see that
57:38 and so he's looking around desperately
57:40 for something to
57:41 uh cover that body up with and he found
57:44 a towel
57:45 on the ground and he said when he picked
57:48 up the towel
57:49 to move it the part that was missing
57:52 from the body
57:53 was in the towel and he said he
57:56 lost it this is a hardcore kind of
57:59 cowboy kind of guy
58:02 you see he turned around threw up and he
58:04 was of no use to the situation
58:06 after that moment and i assuming he has
58:10 visions of that for quite a while
58:12 afterwards this is like three decades
58:13 ago when he told me a story
58:16 so he tells me that story and i'm
58:17 thinking to myself oh my god
58:19 never you never would have thought about
58:20 such an event occurring to me
58:23 but it can no matter where you live in
58:25 the world something like that can happen
58:28 and you want to be useful to the
58:30 situation in case you can save a life or
58:32 just something else
58:33 and so i went on this pilgrimage at one
58:36 point
58:37 i don't know when it was late 90s early
58:38 2000s
58:40 with these websites that have those
58:42 pictures of really
58:44 horrific events crime scene photos or
58:46 whatever
58:48 and i've got it out of my system a long
58:50 time ago but
58:52 i forced myself to look at that content
58:55 to desensitize myself
58:57 so that if i ever did get next to now
58:59 it's always going to shock you in real
59:00 life
59:01 i'm not kidding myself but this guy
59:04 never contemplated such a thing
59:06 and i wanted to be useful so i got it on
59:10 my system
59:11 now i feel like okay i'm as much as a
59:14 person could be
59:17 preconditioned before actually
59:19 experiencing i hope in my lifetime i
59:21 never experienced it
59:22 there you go i wanted to break that
59:24 barrier down so i didn't have any type
59:26 of intellectual horror
59:28 that is obviously more on point than my
59:30 my buddy's psychological
59:32 issue but i want to also
59:35 share with you my state of mind
59:38 when i'm looking at my buddy's face
59:41 because he would be the perfect
59:42 candidate now if we had probably more
59:44 dedicated time to each other
59:46 i would have got him over that threshold
59:47 would have called him out right to his
59:48 face you know
59:50 i see a look on your face right
59:53 and uh maybe i will approach him again
59:55 have him come up to the patio and we can
59:57 have a smoke
60:00 go through it but
60:03 for me it was looking at him and
60:06 thinking
60:07 how sad how sad that a man who's
60:10 fully equipped to deal with this is
60:14 refusing to look at the information to
60:17 even contemplate it
60:20 and so we want
60:26 to avoid that situation as personal
60:29 human beings in most cases
60:32 even if you disagree you don't want to
60:33 lose control of yourself what you're
60:35 disagreeing
60:36 you don't want to be locked up with like
60:39 lockjaw because someone said something
60:42 that you can't conceive what's beautiful
60:45 about the universe
60:47 is that it's designed to
60:51 to constantly challenge ourselves the
60:53 second that we have even the most
60:56 remote level of enlightenment
60:59 when you can conceive of infinity you
61:02 have been given the key to the universe
61:06 however even though the key fits in
61:09 every lock
61:11 you have to have the courage to turn it
61:13 to open up every sector
61:15 that infinity is essentially a fabric
61:18 of what you're conceiving of right
61:21 we talk about official science all right
61:25 you've got a a universe that is
61:29 in some scientific circles infinite
61:32 which is bizarre because then it has to
61:34 be an
61:34 it it just is there right
61:38 there is no border it is just
61:42 you keep going and there's more stuff if
61:45 you believe in things like the big bang
61:46 then you believe in there's some sort of
61:48 circular distribution of mass from the
61:50 central point
61:52 if you're heavenly spiritual it depends
61:56 on how what side of the science camp you
61:58 fall on
61:59 this could be a flat earth firmament and
62:02 everything's just been made to
62:05 stimulate parts of your mind you know
62:07 when you look up and you see the stars
62:10 and if you think it's a firm mcdonald's
62:12 there then what the heck are the stars
62:14 and why would they ever be put there
62:17 besides to beckon you
62:20 in a closed system like a firmament dome
62:25 why would there be the moon why would it
62:27 be there
62:28 you do need the sun do you need the moon
62:32 is it truly a mechanism to churn the
62:34 waves
62:35 because the flat earth people have
62:38 theories
62:39 to dismiss that okay
62:43 so why is everything that is and what is
62:46 it
62:48 that is where you can't engage in the
62:51 most
62:52 basic baby steps towards these concepts
62:57 if you haven't flushed through your
62:59 system by cleaning out the old radiator
63:01 right you get out of the rust out of
63:03 your system
63:04 that is indoctrinated into you from the
63:06 moment you're born
63:09 i was talking to my buddy and i was
63:10 sharing him with him the theory that
63:12 i've shared with you guys several times
63:13 which is
63:16 the theory that i think that some of the
63:18 greatest epiphanies on planet earth will
63:20 come from children
63:21 once we get these vultures away from our
63:25 kids
63:27 and what was really funny was that my
63:29 buddy recreated one of the scenarios
63:31 that i created for you on episodes like
63:34 hundreds of episodes back where he said
63:36 well just imagine you're on an
63:37 island and you have to look at the
63:40 universe
63:41 on an island without any indoctrination
63:43 i said i'm totally with you man
63:45 what i did in my story was i had a
63:47 children
63:48 so you are now
63:52 trying to tell your kids what the stars
63:55 are because they're asking you love your
63:56 kids you want to give them an answer but
63:58 if you were devoid of any organized
64:00 religion
64:01 science and you're just born on that
64:03 island
64:04 and they exist man
64:08 is it new guinea right what about the
64:11 people who grow up in the peruvian
64:13 forests or
64:14 rainforest right they've got their
64:17 religion
64:17 that they've invented themselves until
64:20 they bump into society right
64:23 but imagine you had nothing but you've
64:25 been looking at the stars for a long
64:26 time
64:30 isn't it interesting that at some point
64:32 in our development as humans
64:34 we started telling stories about those
64:36 things
64:38 the native americans i think have the
64:40 coolest story about the stars which it
64:43 is the souls of all that have
64:45 passed in the past which obviously we
64:48 can't see enough to account for them
64:50 with our naked eye
64:53 but that's a beautiful story but someone
64:55 felt the
64:56 need to say that to probably comfort
65:00 someone who's just lost somewhere very
65:01 significant to them
65:04 if everyone's in on their santa claus
65:06 story yeah maybe you have a young person
65:08 who's lost a parent or a grandparent
65:10 so they're young they're impressionable
65:14 there's no internet for them to look up
65:16 that you're wrong
65:18 it's all the parents one parent starts
65:20 the story
65:21 well let me let me uh show you something
65:24 here
65:24 sit down you're gonna get away from the
65:27 campfire right and they
65:28 point up there and i see that really
65:30 bright star right there yeah see the one
65:32 to the left of it
65:33 that wasn't there yesterday and that is
65:35 your grandmother
65:37 she's up there now watching over you she
65:39 is now
65:40 blessed to be in that the other side
65:44 really and all the other parental
65:47 figures
65:47 relatives friends who are older yeah
65:50 that's brand new star
65:53 and then of course as the kid wakes you
65:54 know grows older
65:57 maybe he or she will start telling the
65:59 story to comfort
66:01 but then that grows that little mustard
66:02 seed grows into more
66:04 and more stories until we have
66:07 probably the most creative stories or
66:09 the ones that are accepted and the ones
66:11 that are
66:11 less creative and redundant and they're
66:14 not remembered
66:16 for me intellectual horror
66:20 is a weakness
66:23 anytime the mind cannot deal with
66:26 information
66:28 for me that's an exciting frontier
66:32 for me you know i would think
66:35 that the emotional state i would go in
66:39 if a ufo landed in the
66:40 right in front of my house in the circle
66:44 i live on
66:45 it just landed right there and the door
66:46 opens up and a whole bunch of aliens
66:48 come out
66:49 as long as they don't have like guns and
66:52 they're
66:52 not you know shooting us but as long as
66:54 they're cool and they're like hey how
66:55 you doing
66:57 my level of utter epiphany or epiphany
66:59 excuse me
67:00 um amazing wonderment
67:04 of that event is sort of how i feel if
67:07 someone can
67:08 throw me something but i've never
67:10 conceived of before
67:12 it's like oh wow there's another episode
67:15 yes for me
67:20 the antithesis of
67:23 expansion which is a contraction of
67:26 belief
67:27 is more horrific to me than the
67:29 expansion
67:31 meaning all this beautiful stuff we're
67:33 experiencing
67:34 all this amazing input we're feeling
67:36 because we again are the most
67:37 sophisticated machine
67:39 in the universe there may be more like
67:41 us okay
67:42 we are incredible machines
67:46 and what a lot of you are doing is
67:49 trying to
67:50 unlock all that has been shut off
67:53 since you were born through
67:54 indoctrination to perhaps protein
67:57 blockers in your visual cortex you drop
67:59 acid take ayahuasca and it just jumps
68:02 the
68:03 it jumps the barrier the water goes over
68:05 the dam
68:07 and you get to see the other half of for
68:09 the other 90 percent of the universe
68:13 i i realized and i i'm going to be doing
68:16 an episode
68:16 in the next season on lucid dreaming
68:21 because i finally had some big moments
68:23 and lucid dreaming recently
68:26 and uh going past that
68:30 particular subject matter what i have
68:33 realized is that
68:35 i've got friends and i asked them you
68:36 know did you dream last night did you do
68:38 them last night i asked them that
68:39 because i want to know
68:41 and some of them do some of them don't
68:44 some folks have dreams every once in a
68:46 while
68:47 very like maybe 20 of the time they have
68:49 a dream
68:51 some say we have dreams all the time
68:56 what i have realized is that i never
68:59 ever sleep
69:00 without having a dream and it could be
69:03 like i stayed up to four o'clock in the
69:06 morning working
69:08 and then i go to sleep at four but i
69:10 wake up at like
69:12 10 still kind of tired i want to grab
69:14 another hour of sleep whatever but i
69:16 made me mess with my phone for 45
69:18 minutes whatever then i just roll over
69:19 and
69:20 get that last hour of sleep in
69:23 even that last hour is the dream
69:26 i can't help but think that
69:30 opening my mind by tearing down all
69:32 these barriers
69:34 of the intellectual horror that i used
69:36 to experience perhaps when i was younger
69:38 has essentially just made it so that i
69:41 dream all the time
69:43 i dream all the time when i'm asleep
69:46 it's not a night that goes by or i wake
69:48 up no i didn't have anything happen
69:49 now i might forget my dream really
69:52 really quickly
69:53 because it's not terribly important what
69:55 i try to remember is the overall
69:56 sentiment of my dream cycle
69:59 that was really fun those people were
70:00 really good i had to pee this morning so
70:02 my dream made the last 10 minutes really
70:04 containers until i finally woke up and
70:07 relieved myself right the twilight zone
70:12 show on tv from 59 to 65.
70:16 the toilet zone is a real thing i
70:18 thought he was just made up by rod
70:20 sterling but it's actually that moment
70:21 between
70:22 sleep and consciousness
70:25 you're in that twilight zone
70:29 what i think that the intellectual
70:31 horror moment is
70:33 is a conscious twilight zone
70:36 between all the paradigms you accept
70:40 and the new one that's on the other side
70:42 being offered to you
70:43 if you can just get through the barrier
70:48 now i said a long time ago in an episode
70:51 i don't remember the name of it but it
70:53 was about the
70:54 threshold of maybe belief
70:58 the name of it but it has to do with
71:00 this barrier that we have
71:02 that many of the elite of the world have
71:05 talked about
71:06 especially david rockefeller i think in
71:08 his 79
71:09 speech to the press corps he did
71:12 definitely gave this speech the press
71:14 score but he essentially said that as
71:15 long as what we
71:16 plot to do is so horrific that the
71:19 average population can't conceive of it
71:22 then we can do whatever we want why is
71:25 that
71:26 i mean he seems to know that that meant
71:29 now that sorry that mechanism
71:31 works well we know that that's what they
71:35 do
71:36 all the time things you can't conceive
71:38 they're absolutely horrific happen and
71:39 then all of a sudden
71:41 we are scrambling for whatever feel good
71:44 explanation we'll explain it away so we
71:47 can deal with it
71:50 for my buddy he had hit a barrier of
71:53 spirituality and the soul
71:56 and has i think falsely
72:01 celebrated the notion that everyone who
72:04 believes in such a thing
72:05 forget because i said to him forget
72:07 religion it's just
72:09 you have something else that's you why
72:11 do all the
72:12 you know the gurus of the world tell you
72:14 not your body and your soul or not your
72:15 body and your mind excuse me
72:18 you are your soul why because they spent
72:21 you know
72:22 three to five thousand years
72:25 practicing that belief and got results
72:29 you know one of the best things that i
72:32 can attach
72:32 to this is a good
72:37 drivers training instructor
72:41 will always tell you to expect the
72:44 unexpected
72:46 when you're driving your car if any of
72:48 you have watched or
72:50 binged watched some of these uh videos
72:52 on youtube
72:53 which is like the worst drivers ever or
72:55 these basically their insurance cam
72:57 videos
72:58 of accidents
73:01 expecting unexpected is probably an
73:04 understatement of what can happen to you
73:07 any any time you are near moving
73:10 vehicles of any kind whether you're in
73:12 some construction site
73:13 some manufacturing assembly line or just
73:17 driving down the street or especially
73:18 walking down the street
73:21 i saw one the other day where no one got
73:23 injured
73:24 but a truck drove by and you look at
73:26 this video and you don't know
73:28 what part's gonna go wrong which for me
73:30 is fascinating because
73:32 it helps you discern to what degree do i
73:36 expect the unexpected
73:38 because you can say that all you want
73:40 but you won't know where to look you
73:41 won't know where danger
73:43 could possibly happen this big utility
73:45 truck drives by
73:47 had like a an earth moving bucket on the
73:50 back you know
73:53 and suddenly a gigantic tire you know
73:56 how big those tires are right
73:57 they have multiple tires on one axle
73:59 right so one of the tires
74:01 had basically come off the vehicle just
74:04 one not the dually right so there's
74:06 another one keeping that truck going
74:08 but here comes this missile that is a
74:11 rolling tire which i could only assume
74:12 was probably about three feet tall
74:15 probably weighs you know several hundred
74:18 pounds
74:18 and here it comes i ended up bouncing
74:21 off something else
74:22 and then uh went through a window and
74:26 this dude was standing right there and
74:27 went right by him
74:28 and then just jumped through this window
74:30 of this house
74:32 amazing now the dude that was able to
74:35 witness that
74:35 us who were able to see the video
74:38 through surveillance cameras
74:40 now have this huge enlightenment that oh
74:42 my god you know if you're driving on the
74:44 highway next to a big rig or a big
74:46 earth-moving truck especially in third
74:47 world countries where the vehicles don't
74:49 have much
74:50 requirements in terms of maintenance and
74:53 you know
74:54 maintainability but it happens all the
74:55 time i was driving
74:57 probably this year in a truck
75:01 i think it was going to um joshua tree
75:04 way out the desert and this dude's tire
75:07 blew on a big rig but he was up about a
75:09 quarter mile in front of me here comes
75:12 this tire boom
75:13 you know shedding into a bunch of pieces
75:15 cars were swerving all over luckily it
75:16 was intense traffic
75:19 but if you think about all these little
75:21 mechanisms in your mind
75:23 the deal with this information that
75:25 anticipate this information
75:29 when you get when you grow accustomed
75:32 to doing what i call the sid mead
75:35 90 degree turn sid mead was a futurist
75:39 futurist um designer
75:42 he did you know movies like star trek
75:45 the motion picture
75:47 uh blade runner tron aliens all this
75:50 other stuff 2010
75:52 what this dude was able to do is look at
75:55 a need
75:56 i need a spaceship because that's what
75:57 i've been hired to do i need to create a
75:59 car
75:59 or a flying vehicle or a wardrobe piece
76:04 and he says you know he's been hired to
76:05 design the futuristic version of it
76:09 what he's able to do is take something
76:12 and
76:12 rotate it and redesign it in a different
76:14 way and he finds all these
76:16 beautiful efficiencies in the world
76:18 again i've mentioned this once before
76:20 but to give you an idea of how sid
76:22 changed
76:22 the world in just one little incidental
76:24 way like tesla creating a
76:26 remote-controlled boat in the 1890s
76:31 was this it was designed uh was here
76:33 excuse me sid was hired
76:34 to design a cruise line ship
76:38 and most specifically the uh the inside
76:41 of the ship because they hadn't created
76:42 these
76:43 things that they have now where
76:44 everyone's outside so we're trying to
76:46 create a weatherproof
76:48 center column inside the ship where it
76:49 was like a giant mall
76:51 inside the ship guarded by the outside
76:55 living departments but he got to the
76:57 outside of the ship and he was looking
76:59 at all the lifeboats
77:00 that are hanging on the edge of the ship
77:02 all nice and bundled up right he's like
77:04 man that's so
77:04 ugly it takes away from the contour of
77:07 the hole
77:08 so he redesigned everything so the boats
77:11 can be put above the walkways
77:14 that the citizens walk on the edge of
77:16 the boat thus
77:17 giving back the geometry of the original
77:20 designer of the whole
77:21 without uglifying the outside right
77:25 that's a futuristic term and suddenly
77:29 even though i think the boat that he
77:30 designed was never built
77:32 literally everyone in the industry
77:34 started putting the boats
77:36 over the walkways making them look
77:38 sexier
77:40 poof it's a different way to look at
77:42 things
77:44 why am i mentioning this well let's say
77:47 you have pushed through a threshold
77:49 instead of being appalled by
77:51 this barrier of belief you're now
77:54 excited and you're going okay
77:56 i have no idea what i'm looking at but
77:58 i'm gonna make
77:59 i'm gonna make myself go through this
78:02 until i become
78:03 knowledgeable about it and perhaps if
78:05 your aptitude and vocational background
78:08 matches whatever you're investigating
78:11 it is uh something you're gonna become
78:14 an expert at
78:16 so what i'm gonna suggest is that the
78:18 more that you have toyed with
78:21 solving problems of all kinds memory
78:24 that's what keeps your brain as sharp
78:26 as a nail your whole life is solving
78:29 problems
78:30 not going into loops in your life right
78:34 when i get up i do my copy and go to the
78:36 store
78:37 you know do my laundry i watch the car
78:38 and i go back to bed then i wake up
78:40 again
78:40 all those loops are just killing your
78:42 brain when you solve
78:44 problems what'll end up happening is
78:49 as soon as you get to a threshold let's
78:52 just say
78:53 let's keep let me give you an analogy
78:55 it's going to be fun
78:57 you are a person who
79:01 has lived a full life let's say that
79:03 you're 50 years old
79:04 you had a good life a bunch of different
79:06 categories of life that you've lived
79:09 and now for whatever reason you bumped
79:10 into the right people at a party and you
79:12 expressed your interest in egyptology
79:16 and some guy in his 70s or down or 70s
79:19 is like you know what
79:20 we have an expedition that's going to
79:22 spend about two years in egypt
79:25 we're definitely going to fly home
79:26 during that time visit our families but
79:28 we'll be stationed in egypt for the
79:30 entire time we got all these special
79:31 passes
79:34 and we're going to explore a brand new
79:37 pyramid a brand new tune or we're going
79:40 to go to everything that's been
79:41 discovered
79:43 and have another look at it
79:48 and we're going to need some really
79:50 fresh thinkers
79:51 very innovative thinkers clever people
79:54 to see things that haven't been seen
79:56 before
79:57 and to find solutions we may find none
80:02 but we're going to give it our best try
80:05 it'll be your first
80:08 50 years of using your mind in very
80:11 clever
80:11 deep thinking ways which will make that
80:14 experience
80:15 exponentially more rewarding for
80:18 everyone involved
80:20 but especially you imagine you came up
80:24 against the wall
80:25 and you know there's a tune behind there
80:28 in the valley of the kings the valley of
80:30 the queens
80:32 and you're looking at this wall and it's
80:34 got this cool
80:37 like seal on it and it's got some
80:39 buckles and stuff that have to be undone
80:41 to get that
80:42 stone to move in fact the stone looks
80:46 massive
80:47 looks like it was put in place and then
80:49 they built the top on it
80:51 and you're gonna have to move some stone
80:52 or cut some stone but you don't want to
80:54 cut the stone because it's ancient
80:57 maybe it's pre-dynastic maybe it's a
80:59 tomb maybe it's not even a tune
81:01 maybe whatever's behind that door could
81:03 be the pre-dynastic key
81:05 to who actually built the pyramids
81:08 and even though you have never solved
81:10 this problem or any problem like this
81:12 in your life metaphorically
81:16 you have because in the past when you
81:20 came up against
81:20 unknowns that disagreed with every
81:24 indoctrinated belief that you have
81:26 allowed to infect your mind
81:29 you were able to contextually wrap that
81:31 up in a container of indoctrination
81:34 and move it to the side and say okay
81:36 it's there as reference just in case
81:38 it's right
81:39 i got it as reference but what i'm
81:41 interested in
81:43 is the next level up
81:46 so you'll have engineers that maybe are
81:49 extremely
81:50 talented left-brained people who are
81:52 with you on your trip
81:53 stone workers construction people and
81:56 they're saying well you can't do this
81:57 and you can't do that but you can do
81:59 this and you can do that
82:00 and so right away we're at a challenge
82:02 point
82:05 but you're thinking you're using your
82:08 mind
82:09 and you're saying to yourself well can
82:11 you do this
82:12 something brand new well
82:15 yeah i guess we could okay
82:20 maybe uh just to be specific
82:24 the big stone in front of us reaches
82:27 into the left wall
82:28 reaches into the right wall you can go
82:30 down a little bit
82:32 so it's like a block it's literally a
82:35 block
82:36 that's trying to keep you from going
82:38 into this passage but you know
82:40 sound tests through the stone reveal
82:43 there's a chamber on the other side
82:44 there's some echoing going on either
82:46 side
82:47 so you're like what we need to do is
82:49 take these two rocks to the left and
82:50 right of the door
82:52 remove enough of the
82:55 rubble out of the way the dirt that's
82:57 falling on it the sand is falling on get
82:59 all that cleared away do we find the
83:00 edge of that particular stone
83:03 and then very carefully slide it
83:07 sideways so it's still supporting the
83:09 rocks above but it's only doing it with
83:10 its tail
83:12 now look above make sure i'm not going
83:14 to release any other rocks we can put
83:15 support beams in
83:17 made of steel to make sure that we don't
83:19 injure the stone above and it doesn't
83:21 fall on our head
83:23 and then we might be able to take that
83:24 stone in front of us
83:26 and pull it forward push it back
83:29 probably pull it forwards a lot better
83:30 so
83:30 injure anything inside
83:34 and then we just create the smallest
83:36 possible opening for human beings to go
83:38 through not some gigantic
83:40 driveway so you can put a put a truck in
83:42 there let's get in there first and see
83:44 what's there
83:46 now what they've done in real life is
83:48 with these little tiny doors that are in
83:49 that great pyramid
83:52 the government of egypt has allowed
83:55 scientists or whatever archaeologists to
83:57 build robots to go up against these
83:59 doors
84:00 and they took a 10-year cycle between
84:02 the first robot and second one for about
84:03 20 years
84:04 and they drilled a hole through the door
84:07 and put the camera
84:10 inside the center of the drill bit so as
84:12 soon as it got to this side
84:14 the camera's right there to take a look
84:16 with the light system and everything
84:18 only to find another chamber on the
84:19 other side it goes up even further
84:22 to another door one of the coolest
84:25 things you'll see in children
84:28 and it took me a while to understand
84:32 this
84:33 but my daughter started to get clever
84:36 and clever is typically associated with
84:40 like
84:41 [Music]
84:43 something a little sneaky something a
84:46 little bit on the lines of what they
84:47 shouldn't be doing they're doing
84:49 because they're being clever uh one of
84:51 my girlfriend's daughters uh
84:53 would hide candy in her room
84:56 or general bars or whatever
84:59 and so she'd stick it in during the day
85:01 and then at night she could just pull it
85:02 out and chew on it in her bed
85:04 you find all these empty wrappers all
85:06 throughout her room she wasn't clever
85:07 enough to get rid of the wrappers the
85:09 evidence
85:10 plus their bed sheets were covered with
85:11 granola
85:15 but i was talking to my girlfriend
85:19 this is when i really put words to it
85:24 she was concerned she was like my
85:25 daughter's not behaving and i'm
85:27 concerned
85:27 that's a treat that's going to continue
85:29 manifesting to the point where
85:31 she's sneaking out a window at night to
85:33 go hang out with her friends right
85:36 and i said well maybe you can look at a
85:38 different way
85:39 i said maybe that's simply your kid
85:41 being clever
85:42 and what does that really mean they're
85:46 using their mind
85:47 in a very original method to get what
85:50 they want
85:52 and clever can be extremely powerful
85:54 because clever is a way of thinking
85:57 that deals with the chaos of life
86:00 i'll give you a word analogy for any of
86:03 you've ever played an old video game
86:05 where there's a boss old arcade stand-up
86:08 game or an old nintendo game
86:10 like zelda's any of the zeldas have
86:12 bosses in them
86:13 they typically be this boss or like
86:15 galaga or something
86:17 or there's something shooting uh just a
86:19 tremendous amount of little
86:22 fireballs at you or lasers or something
86:26 such that if you hit it you die and it
86:28 seems inconceivable
86:30 that you can get through all these
86:32 obstacles
86:34 without dying but somehow you do
86:38 you got clever you may have even gone
86:41 into a separate state of consciousness
86:43 as you were allowing your maybe even
86:46 your peripheral vision to let you get
86:48 through all that which has a high frame
86:50 rate
86:51 you don't stare directly at your ship
86:54 you stare at the entire board
86:56 and you just relax for those of you over
86:59 50 you'll remember
87:00 pinball machines that finally got to the
87:02 point where they had about five balls
87:04 going on
87:05 on the table all by itself
87:09 and the only way that you could
87:10 constantly keep them in circulation is
87:12 if you stared in the center
87:14 of the pinball machine floorboard you
87:17 know the center of the field
87:19 and just let your peripheral vision let
87:21 you know when something is by one of the
87:22 flippers and the
87:23 kiss of death was the third flipper that
87:25 was up on the right or left
87:27 but your brain could keep up with it
87:30 as long as you relaxed your focus i'll
87:33 tell you a little secret
87:35 uh when i was a kid
87:38 in my teen years we used to go to this
87:43 amusement park called worlds of fun
87:45 which is on the missouri side of kansas
87:47 city
87:48 it's like a little disneyland but it's
87:50 more like a probably magic mountain sort
87:52 of thing
87:54 really cool place and they had this game
87:56 called whack-a-mole
87:57 and most of you've seen it five little
88:00 holes two on the bottom three across the
88:02 top and you get this soft
88:04 you know club that you pound the moles
88:06 as soon as they pop
88:07 up and if you can hit them you get a
88:10 bunch of score and then you keep playing
88:12 you get these tickets and these points
88:14 and you get all the stuff in the back
88:15 right
88:17 well my dad was a photographer we had a
88:20 studio as in the roof of our house
88:22 the second story of our home and one of
88:25 the things we realized was that
88:27 if anyone wanted their kids to be in the
88:30 shot
88:31 it's difficult to control children and
88:33 so
88:35 we had some of these animals that we had
88:39 won
88:40 and we realized that my dad baited the
88:42 child with picking
88:43 any one of them he could take any one of
88:45 the moment only one
88:47 oh my god they behaved so insanely it
88:50 was great and then he got to go home
88:51 with this
88:52 this little stuffed animal or whatever
88:54 it was right
88:56 what we figured out i think it was my
88:58 dad that figured it out
89:00 what he didn't know what he was doing
89:02 was he was relying on his peripheral
89:03 vision
89:04 which has massive frame rate it's almost
89:06 twice the frame rate of you looking
89:07 straight ahead and focusing on something
89:10 the name of the game because we went
89:12 back to worlds of fun
89:14 and we cleaned them out
89:17 half a dozen times so we filled the
89:19 studio with all these
89:20 it wasn't free but it was definitely
89:22 pretty cheap
89:24 you stare at the wood
89:28 in the center of all five of the holes
89:30 you never ever stare at the hole
89:33 once you stare at the wood that mole
89:35 comes up and you've got seemingly
89:38 minutes in your mind to hit it
89:40 and you will hit every single ball you
89:42 will not miss a single mall
89:44 the maximum price that you can take home
89:46 you will take home
89:49 my advice is to do it before you leave
89:51 the park because you'll be carrying that
89:52 crap around all the time
89:55 thinking clever instead of being
89:58 absorbed by
90:00 the system you got past that
90:03 then a new method you think differently
90:06 stuff happens
90:07 no thresholds for you no horror for you
90:11 so how does this apply to your life
90:14 well you probably have heard several
90:16 examples that you can apply to your life
90:18 but let's be real specific
90:22 if you have something that is a weakness
90:24 for you a phobia of some sort
90:27 this is where you get into it and you
90:28 get clever
90:30 you gotta come at it a different way a
90:34 friend of mine carla
90:36 she gave me this beautiful story and i
90:37 told her i was going to use it in an
90:38 episode
90:39 here we are she had grown up
90:43 at least two or two two or three decades
90:47 where she had a arachnophobia
90:51 scared of spiders and it wasn't all
90:54 spiders but it was
90:56 a lot of them the kind that you bump
90:58 into in your home
91:00 but she went to
91:04 south america and did an ayahuasca trip
91:07 for like something like 10 days or two
91:09 weeks or something like that
91:12 she said on one of her trips if it
91:15 wasn't her first one
91:18 i guess it's called lady ayahuasca shows
91:21 up in your vision
91:23 and most people see this on their first
91:24 trip which is we're gonna have most of
91:26 your hallucinations
91:28 because your mind gets used to it after
91:29 a while she had several experiences
91:31 which are really cool
91:33 but she said that lady ayahuasca came to
91:36 her as a really tall
91:38 being i don't think she ever described
91:40 that being to me
91:43 but she said that in front of her was
91:46 all of a sudden a huge
91:50 probably i'm guessing from her story
91:53 somewhere between
91:54 six and eight feet especially as it rose
91:56 up on its
91:57 legs a giant chrome
92:00 spider the big old you know
92:04 cluster of eight eyes and she said it
92:08 you know reared back and pulled back its
92:10 arms
92:11 and so she's staring at this gigantic
92:14 spider
92:16 for whatever reason because lady
92:18 ayahuasca was standing behind the spider
92:20 taller than the spider
92:24 she knew that she was in no harm and the
92:26 sentiment
92:28 the feeling between her and this writer
92:31 was beautiful
92:34 comforting almost to say if i were to
92:38 put in my own words into what she said
92:40 it was as if the spider said you don't
92:42 need to worry about us
92:44 we're not here to hurt you that doesn't
92:47 mean you can't get bit
92:48 but overall we're just like you
92:52 if we feel threatened we're gonna do
92:53 what we do otherwise
92:55 he'll never hear from us he'll just see
92:57 us
92:58 and so at that point she had no more
93:00 figures
93:02 now i'm not saying go down and take
93:04 ayahuasca by any means
93:06 i guess if you can you can i haven't
93:07 taken that so i have no recommendations
93:09 or
93:10 cautions otherwise but let's think about
93:14 life for just
93:15 one second you know
93:19 way back in season one i i believe i
93:22 shared this
93:23 notion that there's a statement that's
93:26 said about life that i
93:27 absolutely love which is life's a [ __ ]
93:30 and then you die
93:32 what a horrible statement to say it's
93:35 horrible for you to say
93:36 to yourself especially with any
93:37 conviction but it's also heresy to say
93:39 to another human being that perhaps
93:41 until you said that had a fairly chipper
93:45 view of life and now they're like really
93:48 maybe they look up to you and you don't
93:49 even know it you said it just to be
93:50 funny or whatever
93:54 okay is it a [ __ ]
93:58 yes life kicks our butt life
94:03 doesn't care about anything it just is
94:06 what it is
94:07 and it's our collection of experiences
94:10 given an anthropomorphic name called
94:12 life
94:14 there's ups and there's downs but how
94:16 are you going to know you're up if you
94:17 haven't been down
94:19 again i told a story once where my
94:21 credit got creamed
94:24 when i was younger and i went to try and
94:26 buy a car
94:28 and at the dude it was like that that
94:30 scene in simpson's where the alarm went
94:32 off when he tried to buy something he
94:33 goes oh is that alarm good
94:35 is this when you've ever known alarm to
94:36 be good that kind of happened in the
94:38 finance room and the dude just
94:40 basically sat back in the chair and
94:41 realized he's not be able to sell him
94:43 anything
94:45 but it was really cool what this dude
94:47 did for me and uh
94:49 he goes well you know my dad told me
94:51 once he goes life's full of peaks and
94:53 valleys
94:54 and he goes if you're in a valley
94:58 one you can only go to a peak after that
95:00 point two
95:02 you're never going to know you're on a
95:03 peak until you've been to a valley
95:06 as much as we bicker online about belief
95:08 systems and all that stuff
95:11 part of it can be construed as well at
95:13 least you're living
95:16 you know even suffering is living
95:19 2020 has had a tremendous
95:23 level of suffering for some people
95:26 of course other years have too but 2020
95:29 is a very special
95:30 number isn't it what should have been a
95:32 massively wonderful year is being
95:33 destroyed by
95:35 people with political agendas criminals
95:38 pedophiles human traffickers horrible
95:40 people
95:43 but now if we ever gets a chance to
95:46 correct any of that stuff
95:49 then we'll know we live in a better
95:51 society
95:52 as a matter of fact some people were
95:54 waking up every day with no convictions
95:56 of any kind
95:57 they didn't know there were any problems
95:58 in the world and now they do
96:01 now some people have no agendas i mean
96:03 sorry they have agendas but they don't
96:05 have any demands and so nothing's ever
96:07 going to change
96:10 their feeble attempt at creating demands
96:11 are so obtuse and ridiculous that
96:13 they're just going to destroy society
96:15 with those ideas because they're
96:17 very unintelligent low vibration people
96:19 who never think of solutions
96:22 they're too young in some cases in some
96:23 cases they're just too dumb
96:26 we're over here in our little camp
96:30 we're going on our own deep thoughts
96:32 ayahuasca truth
96:35 think about it all the frontiers you
96:38 could explore
96:40 are pretty interesting
96:44 that's why when i get a lot of um
96:47 i don't get it too much again i just had
96:49 someone recently a couple months ago
96:51 talk about the um too many flat earthers
96:55 being on the facebook page
96:56 and that wasn't even a reference to the
96:59 actual subject matter flat earth
97:00 it was that this woman was a super pro
97:02 mask [ __ ]
97:04 who wanted me to post everything from
97:07 the cdc
97:08 on the website as if it was true
97:10 everything that's true that gets sparked
97:11 as
97:12 potentially untruth by the era
97:15 brotherhood censorship club of facebook
97:18 she wanted me to endorse all that i'm
97:20 like go away
97:21 no i don't need you he's part of this
97:23 you're an infection
97:25 and she was trying to manipulate me to
97:27 change
97:28 to her thing otherwise she wasn't gonna
97:30 watch the show i was like lady
97:32 never watch the show again you know
97:34 until you grow up
97:35 come back and sit down we don't need you
97:38 you guys are growing to do
97:39 right now what i should say is
97:42 once you pull up a chair sit down and uh
97:46 listen for a while maybe maybe something
97:48 maybe one of these listeners will
97:51 say something you can get behind but if
97:52 you're so clogged up
97:54 that you're in you're you're over 40 and
97:57 you're still asleep
97:59 it just gets more difficult more
98:01 difficult the more you let
98:02 indoctrination compound on top of you
98:05 that's not us is it we live in the
98:07 blissful
98:08 universe that we
98:12 see all these different frontiers think
98:15 about
98:16 some of the frontiers we talked about on
98:17 this show i mean
98:19 at nauseam hours and hours and hours
98:23 we've talked about what reality is
98:26 we've talked about the matrix reality
98:29 versus a religious reality versus
98:30 essential consciousness
98:32 universe reality we talked about why
98:35 those things
98:36 might have come to be we've got flat
98:39 earth folks we've got rounder folks no
98:41 one should be mad at each other
98:43 get into each other's game really get
98:46 into it
98:48 i went off to prove uh roswell ufo crash
98:51 fake and i came out a permanent believer
98:54 unless i get some other
98:56 incredible information which i would
98:58 think
98:59 trying to trump the testimonies of the
99:01 people who were there at the time who
99:02 suffered because of it
99:04 you probably won't be able to dislodge
99:06 that from my mind
99:09 you've got dream realities what is the
99:11 dream why do we all have to sleep
99:14 if sleep is merely a cycle because we're
99:16 tired what if you slept all day
99:19 and wouldn't you have at least a couple
99:20 days of consciousness why do we all have
99:23 to sleep at night
99:24 we just disintegrate don't we why sleep
99:26 deprivation
99:27 so debilitating to the human form
99:32 star trek's made episodes about losing
99:33 rem sleep never gets all cranky with
99:36 each other
99:38 friend of mine he just had a mini stroke
99:40 a different guy
99:41 and he couldn't sleep he was taking too
99:44 much of his medication because his brain
99:46 wasn't working right
99:47 he couldn't sleep he hadn't slept for
99:48 days it was just terrific he was just
99:51 going insane
99:52 i saw him today he is i think
99:56 pretty much almost back to normal it's a
99:58 beautiful thing how the brain works
100:01 he didn't even remember me visiting half
100:03 a dozen times
100:06 interesting
100:08 we look at alternative medicines
100:10 alternative ways of curing cancer
100:12 a particular instance of cancer you can
100:14 always catch it again if you don't treat
100:16 yourself right
100:17 we talk about how the mind works i mean
100:20 the list goes on
100:21 ufos the moon missions all this cool
100:24 stuff
100:26 so the universe is actually very
100:28 exciting
100:30 sadly there's not a lot of people
100:32 starting these conversations
100:35 sadly some people that do start the
100:37 conversations very very
100:39 beautifully will then drift off into
100:41 other indoctrination and close your mind
100:43 back up again
100:44 what i'm trying to make a point of is
100:45 that there's everything to be gained
100:48 by recognizing if you are in a state of
100:50 intellectual horror
100:52 to take a deep breath count to ten
100:56 okay that was a good one i just got
100:59 nailed by something that made me feel
101:01 really uncomfortable
101:03 okay now let's slowly approach it from a
101:05 different angle
101:06 let's twist and turn it rotate it take a
101:08 look at it from a different angle where
101:10 we don't feel so threatened
101:11 take control of the information
101:15 exploration as opposed to a friend that
101:17 might be shocking you with a statement
101:19 or something that you never
101:20 conceived of before all this is good for
101:24 your brain
101:25 remember what i said about solving
101:27 problems but what if i said to you
101:31 okay you've got a family that lives to
101:33 be a hundred on average
101:36 but you're kind of terrified you want to
101:37 make it to 100 but you're kind of
101:38 terrified you're like [ __ ] i don't lose
101:40 my eyesight and my hearing and i want to
101:41 be in a wheelchair
101:43 i want to be a really vibrant 95 year
101:46 old
101:47 there's plenty of them out there and
101:48 walk around they're fine
101:50 but you at nothing if nothing else you
101:52 don't want to live to be 100 but the
101:54 last 10 years of your life you're
101:56 completely bonkers okay
101:59 so you're thinking i heard once from
102:01 somebody that solving problems
102:03 keeps me young keeps my brain cells
102:05 manufacturing repairing etc
102:09 how do i find an inexhaustible amount of
102:12 problems to solve
102:13 that don't feel like problems we don't
102:15 want to solve
102:18 like math problems or something if
102:20 you're not a mathematician you don't get
102:21 off on that sort of thing
102:24 well the simple answer is
102:27 find all these new frontiers
102:30 of of existence think about them
102:33 rotate through them don't bore yourself
102:36 death you're like well
102:37 my brain started hurting i felt that
102:39 threshold of belief i tried to think
102:40 about
102:41 the infinity of the universe i tried to
102:43 think about the infinity of heaven
102:45 and i started hurting inside my brain
102:48 okay
102:49 get to that point what's happening is
102:51 that approach
102:52 path that you're taking to the problem
102:55 is developing
102:56 that threshold any of you've ever
102:59 studied like war
103:01 or yeah just real simple example
103:04 there's a fortress it's a castle it's
103:07 got a
103:08 drawbridge and all that stuff right and
103:11 you realize that that's got guards on it
103:13 the drawbridge is up at night you can't
103:15 sneak in
103:17 all right but you need to get in well
103:20 maybe it has a moat around it
103:21 there's no sewage drainage pipes you can
103:23 crawl through
103:24 so you're gonna have to think of a
103:25 different way to get in
103:28 okay well the front door immediately
103:30 tells you can't get in
103:31 as soon as you get clever about it
103:34 there's a catapult a parachute
103:35 who knows man there's some other way to
103:37 get in smuggle yourself inside
103:40 a bushel of hay that's going to get
103:42 taken in to feed all the animals inside
103:45 you're down underneath breathing through
103:47 a hole that's drilled into the
103:49 floorboard of the wagon that's been
103:50 being gonna be pulled in he thought
103:52 differently you got clever
103:54 the life became interesting again
103:57 you could build a wooden badger i'm just
103:59 just saying
104:01 so anyway hope you feel me on this one
104:04 it's just an interesting experience i
104:05 wanted to share it with you guys because
104:08 it was an epiphany to me when i looked
104:10 at my buddy's face and was like
104:11 wow he's robbie the robot who's been
104:14 told to kill
104:15 leslie nelson in the forbidden planet
104:17 now he's just going into an absolute
104:18 short circuit
104:21 we don't want to be that guy or girl
104:24 we want to be free want to be able to
104:28 kind of go oh
104:29 well that's weird anything about this
104:32 well have you ever thought about this
104:33 and you think about it from a different
104:34 angle poof
104:35 there's an epiphany a solution a eureka
104:38 moment
104:40 anyway if you want to find more of this
104:42 type of content it's more
104:44 of this thinking go to

105:18 couple ways to donate to the show the
105:20 most popular way is through patreon
105:23 and that definitely in 2020 has added
105:26 some financial relief
105:28 especially since i realized that i had
105:30 never cashed in the money
105:32 it just was all sitting in there and i
105:33 was realizing yeah naturally
105:35 sure these things are paid out and he
105:36 says you've never set it up
105:38 so i appreciate every single one of you
105:40 what you get on patreon
105:42 it's a single tier system so
105:45 um i'm still trying to think about how
105:47 to give you guys an extra tier but i'm
105:49 so limited with time
105:50 every time i conceive of the next tier
105:52 of like hey i'll call you on the phone
105:54 or
105:55 or we'll do a skype together or zoom or
105:57 whatever
105:58 i probably couldn't keep up is the
106:00 problem
106:02 but you get in the credits forever
106:04 unless you don't want to be in the
106:05 credits i'll take you out
106:06 you get the episodes when the season is
106:09 live you'll get
106:10 episodes two or three days before
106:12 everybody else
106:13 i just did the one before the tesla
106:15 episode you guys got a couple days view
106:17 before everybody else
106:19 actually got viewed quite a bit for a
106:20 while there i was giving everyone
106:22 previews for three days and it wouldn't
106:24 get viewed
106:25 but this last one got chewed up quite a
106:27 bit beforehand which was great
106:30 but the best thing for about the website
106:32 is that if you're looking for a subject
106:33 matter
106:34 one that you don't know exists or not
106:37 just
106:38 type in words in the search field on the
106:39 website and you'll be amazed that
106:42 there's an episode or two or three or
106:43 four in there there's also a category
106:45 list on there so you can say man i only
106:47 like your moon episodes
106:49 or nasa stuff there's a whole link in
106:51 there it will keep you busy for days
106:54 the show is now hit 56 years of viewing
106:58 if you add up all the hours viewed on
107:00 youtube it's 56 years
107:02 so that's pretty darn cool i appreciate
107:04 every single one of you hanging on
107:06 season six intros coming along just
107:08 great i'm having to do
107:10 a little bit more work to get that done
107:12 should be really cool
107:15 and uh again just uh take care of
107:18 yourself and someone else
