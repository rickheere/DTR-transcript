00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen today we're doing two in one
00:37 day
00:38 today is a request from several of you
00:42 to cover the HBO series Westworld please
00:49 understand that this will have spoilers
00:51 in it one of the reasons I wanted to
00:53 wait such a long time to make this
00:55 episode is to give you all a chance to
00:56 bump into it I know that a lot of you
01:00 don't subscribe to HBO
01:01 I believe HBO Go is a separate
01:05 subscription service that's like Netflix
01:09 like I think it's just a tad cheaper
01:11 than Netflix to be honest but if it's
01:13 barely any more than Netflix right HBO
01:17 is obviously where you buy the channel
01:18 and then you kind of watch what they
01:20 broadcast HBO GO is like Netflix are you
01:22 going and start what you want to see a
01:24 lot of people are pretty disgruntled
01:26 with Netflix inability to create new
01:29 content you know when they come up with
01:30 this you know crazy winner they
01:33 typically have a hard time keeping it
01:35 live like daredevil which is a great
01:39 series
01:40 they just [ __ ] up and we're all having
01:42 to wait a year for season 3 let's season
01:45 1 & 2 or phenomenal so Westworld again
01:49 it's an original series created by HBO
01:52 based on the michael crichton book slash
01:54 movie that was created in 70's with Yul
01:56 Brynner if you've seen the movie then
02:00 you generally know the gist of what the
02:04 HBO series is about but all I employ I'm
02:08 happy to inform you that it is different
02:10 in many many ways
02:13 it is much deeper it's much more amazing
02:16 the cast is utterly phenomenal Anthony
02:18 Hopkins and you know ed Harris is
02:22 probably the best thing ed Harris has
02:24 ever done not quite the best thing that
02:26 Anthony Hopkins has done but then again
02:30 he's still killing this this role it has
02:33 James Marsden from marvel the Cyclops or
02:40 whatever the [ __ ] they call in the laser
02:42 eye guy Jeffrey Wright who was from
02:46 Milwaukee Empire he is one of the most
02:50 phenomenal actors we've seen in
02:52 Hollywood in a very very long time I
02:54 will say that people like Jeffrey Wright
02:57 for Hollywood he is like a gift to
03:01 Hollywood because he's so amazing as an
03:03 actor he he offers us options to write
03:08 things that a lot of actors can't
03:11 perform one of the main heartthrobs is
03:14 evan wood she plays this incredible what
03:19 we'll call host a female character who
03:25 has an interesting backstory let's just
03:27 put that way
03:27 I believe she pronounces her name's Andy
03:30 Newton
03:32 she's this exotic creature who works at
03:36 the local brothel and she's the madam
03:38 and she is she's been in several things
03:40 but this is this has to be one of the
03:43 best thing she's ever been in in her
03:44 life because she just owns it now we'll
03:49 go down every single actors name but I
03:51 will tell you anyone who's in this show
03:52 is doing an amazing job 100% I'd have to
03:57 go for several minutes Jimmy Simpson is
04:00 another guy that's in it who's been in
04:02 house of cards he was in Carnivale as a
04:05 hillbilly Clifton Collins who you've
04:08 seen do amazing things his first movie
04:10 was strange days back in the late 90s he
04:12 was in Pacific Rim one of the Hemsworth
04:16 brothers Luke Hemsworth sent it but this
04:18 show is phenomenal and it appeals to
04:23 folks of obviously all kinds of genres
04:26 it
04:26 it's a Western setting with a sci-fi
04:29 rapper and the show is about again if
04:34 you don't think you're gonna see the
04:35 show at all you don't think you're going
04:36 to subscribe to this you have no friends
04:37 that have HBO GO you might as well
04:39 listen to the whole thing because I'm
04:41 not going to reveal absolutely
04:42 everything you're going to have a great
04:43 time with the series it's concluded its
04:47 first season and we're not waiting for a
04:50 second season to come around and it's
04:52 going so much deeper than Michael
04:54 Crichton's with the interpretation of
04:57 his book I have not read the book I have
04:59 to be completely honest so perhaps the
05:02 book is more like the series I don't
05:03 know I haven't heard anyone claim such a
05:05 thing it takes a while in the first
05:09 episode for you to see what's really
05:11 going on because they start you inside
05:14 this western world it's sort of a south
05:16 southern Arizona border type zone of the
05:21 world and it's in the 1800s roughly it's
05:24 sort of a you know the whole thing is
05:26 fictional inside this this realm in
05:28 terms of what people are doing and who
05:30 they are and their story arcs and that
05:32 kind of thing but very I'd say by the
05:37 halfway point of the first episode you
05:39 start to see that this whole thing is a
05:40 flat disc that is being controlled by a
05:45 sort of a theme park and the whole
05:49 series is about rich people to come in
05:51 and pay $40,000 a day to be inside this
05:54 round disc which is so massive you can't
05:57 find the edges very easily and of course
05:59 there's always mountains to keep you
06:01 from escaping very similar to the
06:03 flatterer theory that's on the internet
06:05 today there are androids that are
06:10 extremely lifelike you certainly can't
06:13 tell they're artificial just by looking
06:16 at them they bleed red blood and they
06:19 are what we call the hosts and they host
06:22 the guests as they know them or the
06:25 Outsiders the guests / the outsiders are
06:29 us the human beings that are paying the
06:31 privilege to go into this world and
06:33 experience a Western fiction very
06:37 similar to the show
06:38 Dark City the movie Dark City obviously
06:42 all the hosts go to sleep as I've gone
06:47 on and on in my dream episodes I find it
06:50 very odd that human beings have to sleep
06:52 that we have to sleep we can't postpone
06:55 easily we can't postpone even two days
06:58 without just utterly disintegrating
07:00 consciously you know sleep deprivation
07:03 is the number one tactic to get
07:04 information out of individuals because
07:08 they we start to get loopy we start to
07:10 get almost the way we get when we do
07:15 hypothermia we lose our faculties when
07:18 we have an ADD need sleep and so we'll
07:20 start to slip our defenses that are up
07:21 to try and conceal information
07:23 deteriorate they go to zero and so these
07:28 hosts must sleep and when they sleep
07:30 they are refreshed and they live in a
07:33 sort of Groundhog Day loop based on when
07:37 the visitors come in and do their thing
07:39 and leave if a host is murdered by a
07:44 guest through some gun gun-slinging
07:47 event or through something else someone
07:50 just gets angry and wants to pull the
07:51 trigger on someone they are then picked
07:55 up taken outside of this disc actually
07:58 they're taken underneath the disc and
08:00 they are cleaned up physically they just
08:02 spray them down get all the blood off of
08:03 them and then they build new tissue I
08:06 guess they get a new epidermis or
08:07 something because no one has any scars
08:09 about the time they're put back out they
08:11 don't really cover that process but
08:14 that's not necessary but a woman might
08:17 be raped and murdered in a barn and then
08:19 she wakes up in her bed the next day and
08:21 she's totally fine and has no memories
08:23 of these events at least up until the
08:26 point the series starts so the mechanics
08:29 of it is are very interesting to kick
08:32 off with at first because it starts to
08:34 get to the dynamics of what's possible
08:36 what's not possible but before I go into
08:39 that I think the reason why people who
08:42 are interested in this show really like
08:45 Westworld is that it it mirrors what
08:48 might be happening in our world and that
08:52 we have a
08:52 you know a designer to put us together
08:54 and you know why don't you start looking
08:59 at the evil that goes on in the world
09:01 you know these [ __ ] that are just so
09:04 dark and so not empathetic you start to
09:07 wonder that there's this seems to be
09:10 some subspecies of [ __ ] in the world
09:13 right and when you really start thinking
09:15 about it you you go almost go one of two
09:18 different ways and you can send you can
09:19 actually reverse the polarity of what in
09:23 reference to Westworld you can sort of
09:25 go well maybe Obama is the guest who
09:30 wants to come in and feel super powerful
09:31 and we're the hosts were the dip shits
09:34 that that believe in common law and do
09:36 no harm right well they're gun slinging
09:38 making Wars happen all this other stuff
09:40 and then you could flip it and say well
09:42 maybe we're the real people and are
09:45 we've signed up for this challenge maybe
09:47 we're in a penal code or what our penal
09:48 zone or something we're in prison for
09:51 something that we did and we're being
09:53 tortured by these [ __ ] who are
09:55 actually the androids who seem to lack
09:57 any sympathy or empathy right so it'd be
10:00 much easier to make a non-player
10:03 character Android meaning they're not
10:05 really participating like we participate
10:07 there this control structure and make
10:10 them seem to have no soul because in no
10:13 heart because that would be easier to
10:15 make right we tend to have all the
10:18 emotions but in this particular world
10:20 what's interesting is it's the guests
10:23 who are the [ __ ] the humans and the
10:27 androids are the good people now for
10:30 those of you didn't see Dark City just
10:32 so you understand the correlation there
10:34 if you haven't seen the movie you should
10:35 go through the movie especially if you
10:36 like West world but it's about a city
10:40 that's a disc floating in space it has
10:42 been I won't ruin it for you but I'll
10:44 say this everyone goes to sleep at night
10:48 and when they go to sleep this faction
10:50 of weird people and I think they're in
10:55 black trench coats even even the
10:56 maintenance crews in black trench coats
10:58 but they move people around they take a
10:59 plumber and they make them a principal
11:01 of the school one day
11:02 and they just jostle everything around
11:04 and the reason why we go to sleep is so
11:06 they can do what's called tuning at
11:08 night which is exactly what happens in
11:10 West world
11:10 now obviously West world the book by
11:12 Michael Crichton came out before Dark
11:14 City was written and made into a film so
11:16 most likely Dark City is is stealing a
11:19 bit of its concept its premise from
11:21 Michael Crichton
11:22 Michael Crichton who mysteriously dies
11:24 at 50 years old you know he was just too
11:28 goddamn smart you know this is the guy
11:30 that wrote Jurassic Park the book which
11:32 is ten times better than the film but
11:35 the dark city premise is that our main
11:38 character for whatever reason ceases to
11:41 go to sleep and he ends up seeing this
11:44 this tuning process happened and he
11:46 finds Kiefer Sutherland who's playing
11:48 this sort of mad scientist who's been
11:50 awake for a long time he never goes to
11:52 sleep and he has figured out a lot of
11:56 stuff to be dangerous and our main
11:57 character bumps into him and they start
11:59 you know correlating facts and they try
12:00 to figure out what's going on eventually
12:01 you figure out what's going on going to
12:04 let you watch the movie to figure that
12:05 out
12:06 so in what's world we have a very simple
12:09 a very similar formula excuse me
12:11 but the way this show was organized is
12:16 that we have a set of probably about
12:18 half a dozen hosts that we follow we're
12:20 all generally on a different timeline
12:23 even if their paths cross constantly
12:25 they're in a completely different
12:27 timeline and they have very specific
12:30 purposes and what is referred to as the
12:33 narrative there are hundreds and
12:36 hundreds if not thousands of narratives
12:38 meaning you might come into the town and
12:40 there's an old man selling you the
12:42 promise of finding a treasure way
12:44 outside of town
12:45 there's another one that's going to get
12:46 into a gun-sling battle with you etc etc
12:49 some are just prostitutes to make you
12:51 feel good Anthony Hopkins plays the the
12:55 remaining founder of this of his world
12:58 he had a partner that died in the parks
13:01 mysteriously which gets revealed by the
13:03 I believe the second episode second or
13:06 third episode none of this will really
13:08 ruin it for you but we are going to get
13:10 down to some of the I won't really cover
13:12 where it ends in season one so they're
13:15 deaf
13:16 have after watching this the whole
13:18 mystery of going and watching it finding
13:19 out what's going on but I'll tell you
13:21 what you know even if I were to tell you
13:23 everything that happened in Star Wars 1
13:25 you know which is episode 4 in 1977
13:28 other than telling you maybe the last
13:32 scene where obi-wan Kenobi gets chopped
13:34 in half
13:35 you still need to see the movie right
13:37 you know you still see need to see the
13:39 film so as much as I tell you things
13:40 about Westworld understand that the
13:43 dialogue and the interactions which I
13:45 will not cover are going to be worth
13:46 finding this and watching it but you
13:50 have very disciplined staff members in
13:54 this world which all become characters
13:56 so you have a couple guys that do the
13:58 cleanup job on these hosts when they
14:01 come in all screwed up and it's that's
14:04 probably where the one guy over acts
14:06 this white guy is part of the
14:08 maintenance crew and I really don't like
14:10 any of his lines but there's a an Asian
14:14 guy that's his partner who is so good he
14:16 keeps it all together every time those
14:18 two guys get on camera but other than
14:20 that one guy everyone's pretty good
14:21 there's this sort of sassy female
14:26 character who's sort of playing the
14:28 she's a a behavioral analyst she gets in
14:34 there and looks at their programming
14:36 figures out whether or not they need
14:37 more aggression more perception that
14:39 sort of thing and she there's another QA
14:43 Department that helps put put these
14:45 things you know develop them and test
14:46 them put them out there's a guy named
14:49 Bernard played by the mr. right
14:51 character actor excuse me and he is
14:55 reports directly to Anthony Hopkins and
14:57 he is he's a jewel I mean this guy is
15:00 the sort of head scientist who takes
15:03 care of the individual software bills
15:05 that go into these hosts and so just
15:08 like you would upgrade the operating
15:10 system on your computer the upgrade
15:12 sectors of these hosts that are have
15:13 most interaction with the human beings
15:15 to test out new narratives some of these
15:17 don't need any updates because they have
15:19 such shallow storylines that they're
15:22 good you know one guy supposed to chop
15:25 wood for a fire and that's all he does
15:26 so you don't need to upgrade that guy
15:28 but we join the West
15:30 world show slash world at a time when
15:35 Anthony Hopkins has created a new build
15:38 for the main characters and is revealed
15:42 in a very simple scene where one of the
15:44 prostitutes is being evaluated for
15:48 maintance use taken out I think she
15:51 actually didn't get injured at all she's
15:52 just being brought in for you know
15:54 routine evaluation and when they bring
15:57 these these hosts into the actual
15:59 laboratory a lot of them will have their
16:01 accents they will remember the last
16:03 event that happened in the world so if
16:05 something really emotional happens
16:06 someone gets killed or go into this
16:09 evaluation center which by the way they
16:12 have to all be nude so they keep the
16:14 hosts nude and they keep the the
16:17 technicians clothed the course but that
16:19 allows them to know who's who right only
16:22 in certain scenarios where they're
16:23 polishing out the last behavior models
16:26 to the hosts wear clothing when they
16:28 want to test out how they wear their
16:30 clothes and draw their weapons and that
16:31 kind of stuff most of the characters we
16:33 see are completely nude so feel like
16:35 nude beautiful people West world's going
16:38 to be a lot of fun for you the first
16:40 place that we see the hosts actually
16:43 undergoing a transformation is when one
16:46 of these prostitutes runs her fingers
16:50 over her lips in a very sensual way and
16:53 she's just staring into oblivion right
16:56 there staring right at her and she can't
16:57 see them and one of the technicians goes
16:59 well I've never seen that before
17:01 and that's when the Barnard character
17:02 says yeah these are the the new the new
17:05 feature that Anthony Hopkins plays a guy
17:08 named Ford but they talk about Ford
17:11 giving them something called reveries
17:12 and what that does is that allows them
17:16 to have a unique experience during one
17:19 of their wake cycles and they could
17:21 permanently add these little nuances to
17:23 their character in future builds and
17:26 future moments of being alive and so at
17:31 some point I guess someone touched her
17:33 lips or she touched her own lips when
17:35 she was in a previous incarnation and
17:36 she was able to keep that moving forward
17:39 and we the show centers around a woman
17:43 dolorous inside the host side of things
17:45 and she's this sort of you know prairie
17:48 girl blonde girl who is the most
17:51 innocent of them all and she she ends up
17:55 always having this the scenario where
17:57 she wakes up in the day and goes out and
17:59 paints a little bit goes into the town
18:01 to buy some supplies she drops this
18:03 little suit can which is then picked up
18:05 by her her heartthrob who goes by Teddy
18:10 and they could have kind of this romance
18:14 they go out and hang out together and
18:16 then it's time to go home they go home
18:17 to her house and their house is under
18:19 siege by this bandit that has been
18:21 renegade and all these are hosts so far
18:24 her father gets murdered out front the
18:26 mother gets murdered in the house and
18:28 she gets dragged into a barn and raped
18:31 while Teddy gets shot to the chest now
18:34 you might think that's a spoiler but
18:36 it's not because you're going to see
18:37 that scenario happen a dozen times there
18:40 are scenes were bandits right into town
18:42 with these sort of blankets over them
18:46 the Native American blanket over their
18:47 head and they start blowing the [ __ ] out
18:49 of everybody and that gets played over
18:52 and over and over again just like
18:54 Groundhog Day and what ends up happening
18:57 is by these scenarios repeating
18:59 themselves it gives a bit of traction to
19:02 the host to figure out to start
19:05 subtracting everything that repeats and
19:07 start noticing everything that's
19:08 original and the introduction of the
19:11 reveries creates a sort of a back door
19:16 mechanism if you think about a logic
19:19 gate in a program it allows them to
19:21 escape the game grid inside their mind
19:23 such that they are able to figure out
19:28 who they've been in the past and if some
19:33 of the hosts have been the same
19:34 character their whole life and some of
19:36 them happen some of them have been in
19:37 training some of them are really old
19:40 you'll find at the one of the characters
19:42 is the oldest host ever made she's the
19:45 first one ever made and so she has
19:48 memories to go all the way back to the
19:49 foundation of West world and slowly over
19:53 time through a little coercing by one
19:56 the technicians she ends up having a lot
19:59 of the past revealed now as a writer if
20:03 you've ever taken a grade of writing
20:04 class one of the things that they that
20:06 will come up fairly early in the class
20:09 is the concept that the characters in a
20:11 book could determine that they are
20:13 characters in a book when you know as
20:16 the reader I'm just a purely fictional
20:19 standpoint there is very little you
20:21 could tell a fictional character in a
20:23 book to make them conceive of a book
20:25 unless they have a book in their lap and
20:27 someone says you're one of these and of
20:30 course they feel like they're living a
20:31 beautifully rewarded rich life and they
20:34 can't believe you right so what happens
20:38 to these hosts through these reveries
20:40 something else that starts happening
20:43 which I'll explain in just a second here
20:46 they start waking up slowly and the
20:51 first scene that we see where there's
20:53 something even beyond the reveries that
20:55 wakes someone up is that a couple of the
20:58 guests are have agreed to go on this
21:01 little hunt for a bandit it's like a
21:04 husband-and-wife team I think that's
21:07 this guy looks like Kevin Spacey's
21:08 brother but they go out and they're at
21:12 the first stop you know if you ever
21:14 played a video game they're at the first
21:15 checkpoint where some of the story's
21:16 going to be revealed as to what they
21:18 need to do next and there's the sheriff
21:19 out there kind of laying down the law of
21:22 the land and given the backstory to what
21:24 they're about to get into and he's a
21:26 host it's what he does it's his loop
21:28 it's his narrative and a fly lands on
21:32 his face and he's talking about what's
21:35 going on and his fire lands right on his
21:37 cheekbone and starts crawling around his
21:40 face and the more it crawls around his
21:42 face the more it has presence he starts
21:45 to go into this weird loop and he
21:49 essentially malfunctions to the point he
21:52 can't speak and he starts kind of
21:53 gurgling and going into this weird you
21:56 know physical tick and it really freaks
21:59 out the guests who've never been there
22:00 before and they're like oh [ __ ] let's
22:02 get back to town this is really freaky
22:03 and weird and of course they call call
22:06 in to the people who take care of the
22:08 park-to-park notices this guy's got
22:10 a problem and they pull him in and start
22:12 talking to him and they're you know
22:15 Anthony Hopkins comes around and talk to
22:17 him and starts to realize Jesus what's
22:18 going on here and he's got Bernard with
22:20 him
22:20 so Ford and Bernard the founder and his
22:22 is number one start looking at this
22:24 character and realizing something's up
22:27 there can't I can't figure out whether
22:29 or not it's glass build you know Anthony
22:32 is very mr. Ford dr. Ford he is very
22:36 gracious in his humiliation and he
22:39 admits you know there's there are bugs
22:40 and things you know so this could be
22:42 just one of my bugs but Bernard says
22:46 well maybe this is sabotage it just
22:49 looks a little weird it looks like it's
22:51 way beyond any build modification that
22:54 you've made it looks sort of beyond the
22:56 reveries that you installed this guy's
22:59 really screwed up around the same time
23:02 this is occurring Dorothy's father is a
23:09 guy that always meets her on the bench
23:10 in the morning when she's going out to
23:11 do her painting and he they have a bunch
23:13 of kind of sweet father/daughter small
23:16 talk you know you can tell he loves his
23:19 daughter with all of his heart and she
23:20 feels the same about her father but
23:23 earlier so actually they go out and they
23:26 have their day and the father actually
23:27 is out at a at a stable sort of one of
23:31 these things where you know you break a
23:32 horse and he notices something on the
23:36 ground steps on those little word bends
23:39 down it's a photograph in the dirt and
23:42 all we see it first is him just looking
23:43 at this photograph and he's really
23:46 puzzled as to what he's looking at and
23:49 then later that night when she comes
23:52 home and this is I guess is a scenario
23:54 where he doesn't get murdered he says
23:57 have you ever seen anything like this
23:58 and she comes around looks over his
24:01 shoulder at this photograph and if
24:02 someone has dropped a modern photograph
24:04 of a woman in a what looks like New York
24:06 City or San Francisco or something taxis
24:09 you know going by real fast there's big
24:11 you know skyscrapers in the background
24:13 at least lit buildings with glass
24:15 surfaces and he says have you ever seen
24:16 anything like that where do you think
24:18 she is
24:19 Dorothy being the Good Samaritan host
24:22 that she is
24:23 she says I don't see anything I don't I
24:26 can't make any sense of any of that and
24:28 I don't care you know it's kind of her
24:30 gist of her subtext she goes to bed she
24:35 wakes up the next day and her dad's
24:36 still out there on the patio looking at
24:38 this photograph she says dad have you
24:42 been out here all night looking at that
24:44 photograph and at this point he is not
24:47 daddy anymore as much as he used to be
24:50 and he's been thinking about this and
24:52 somehow through his revery programming
24:56 through perhaps having a fly land on him
24:58 we don't know we never saw that happen
25:00 he is in rare form he is sort of
25:04 disintegrating and mentally and he has
25:10 figured out something overnight that he
25:12 can't really put into words and he warns
25:16 his daughter about this world that maybe
25:19 it's not what we think it is from hosts
25:22 standpoint and he whispers in her ear
25:25 when ends up being a poem about what's
25:32 about to occur essentially meanwhile the
25:35 hosts that are coming in excuse me the
25:36 guests that are coming in are really
25:37 where we get the thrust of the story so
25:40 we have all this backstory revealing
25:42 itself from the host side of things
25:43 which is extremely interesting but you
25:48 have ed Harris comes in as this really
25:50 dark character and he's he's right there
25:53 you ever really see him enter the park
25:54 he's just there and he's on this really
25:59 weird mission he's doing some of the
26:02 traditional things he's done over the
26:03 last thirty years of coming to the park
26:06 you get the sense he's extremely wealthy
26:08 there's a weird scene and I believe
26:10 season 4 episode 4 where someone another
26:14 guest walks up to him and starts
26:17 thanking him for his foundations and his
26:19 financial contributions his philanthropy
26:22 in the real world and it looks at mrs.
26:25 you say another word I'm going to slice
26:26 your neck open shut the [ __ ] up I'm in
26:29 here to be in this world and I don't
26:30 want to talk about the outside world but
26:33 he is on this crazy mission
26:36 everything ed does is phenomenal they
26:42 refer to him as the men in black he does
26:45 have a name and I forgot but what
26:48 happens is that he breaks a lot of the
26:50 narratives he goes off on weird tangents
26:53 here and there and the control center
26:56 when it pops out you see this beautiful
26:57 3d rendered flat earth model of this
27:01 zone they've created like a big gigantic
27:04 Truman Show you get the sense it's like
27:09 maybe maybe it's like a fifth of the
27:12 state of Arizona is inside this thing
27:14 but when it's called up pace on so is
27:17 you know breaking narratives and going
27:20 anywhere the Hemsworth character who
27:22 plays a security person who has to
27:25 authorize anything is sort of weird you
27:27 know if someone starts malfunctioning he
27:30 decides the next step when someone is
27:32 doing bombs or something like pyro
27:35 because like when a guest tries to light
27:37 a stick a dynamite the the determination
27:41 of whether or not the dynamite goes off
27:43 is actually authorized at the top level
27:45 so they control everything but anytime
27:48 he does something strange it gets
27:49 reported to the top and the Sims Worth
27:51 character goes that man gets anything he
27:55 wants so you get this amazing sort of
28:00 invulnerability of the Harris character
28:03 he can do whatever he wants to make
28:07 matters even more interesting the hosts
28:11 cannot hurt the guests but the guests
28:13 can kill the hosts so every time a
28:16 weapon is fired from a host at a guest
28:18 it's like a paintball the something
28:21 penetrates the material and their
28:24 clothing and just gives them a very
28:25 small welt now they I guess they never
28:30 end up shooting the ice or something
28:31 like that right in terms of physical
28:35 scraps they can seem to grab the guests
28:38 and punch them around toss them around I
28:41 don't know what stops a knife from doing
28:42 its damage
28:44 but I guess the host just aren't allowed
28:46 to do that that ed is on a mission the
28:50 backstory of Ed's character the men in
28:52 black the man in black is that he has
28:54 been there so many times he's done
28:56 everything that can be done over and
28:58 over and over again and there's an
29:00 interesting backstory about him getting
29:02 divorced from his wife
29:03 and his wife basically dumping him and
29:05 saying you know you're an evil bastard
29:07 and I can't live with you anymore and
29:11 one of the reasons why he came to the
29:13 park at the very beginning and if you
29:16 hear this from me it's going to make it
29:17 much richer to watch the whole thing as
29:19 opposed to hearing him say I think he
29:21 tells us his story in Episode four and
29:24 then immediately you want to re-watch
29:25 the first three episodes thinking about
29:27 the backstory so if I tell you it's just
29:29 going to make the experience richer but
29:32 he was accused of being a really bad man
29:35 by his wife his ex-wife and so he came
29:38 to Westworld to see if he actually was a
29:40 bad man Yuni ends up doing some of the
29:44 most unthinkable [ __ ] and narratives
29:45 that no longer exist in the 30 years
29:48 later time for him that we're in now he
29:51 finds out he does have it in him and I
29:54 think what you'll kind of deduce is that
29:56 everyone has it in them everyone has a
29:57 little demon inside them that can do
29:59 things that per our standards are in
30:03 conceivably bad right before we go into
30:09 Ed's you know final objective because
30:11 this again won't learn a thing for you
30:13 the gist of Westworld is that you go
30:16 there not to experience a bunch of
30:19 pre-generated narratives you will do
30:22 that but in doing so what you will find
30:26 out is who you really are as a human
30:28 being which i think is phenomenal if any
30:32 of you have played a video game where
30:35 obviously video games are always geared
30:36 to do something sort of out of this
30:38 world you play a games like hitman or
30:40 whatever you realize that you have these
30:45 instincts inside you that seem to be
30:47 completely okay with doing things that
30:49 aren't speakable in the world even if
30:50 it's for the for the greater good you're
30:52 a hero you're getting rid of nots easier
30:54 you're hitman getting rid of other bad
30:56 people you're playing
30:58 Grand Theft Auto and killing every human
31:00 being on planet Earth
31:01 West world is finely tuned to make sure
31:05 that the guests have the most incredible
31:07 epiphanies about who they are as human
31:09 beings and as they tell you this story
31:13 you know it sounds like this whole
31:14 episodes about just a series on HBO for
31:19 all of you who said review West world
31:22 you understand it it's way more than
31:24 that it's a reflection on who we are as
31:28 human beings watching the show the
31:31 series on Netflix called Black Mirror
31:34 the black bear means your TV your TV
31:36 went off is a black mirror that title is
31:40 so ingenious that you are watching
31:42 fictional characters go through
31:44 scenarios and you can't help but if I
31:46 carry ously lives through what you would
31:47 do if you were them so the the metaphor
31:52 in that name is brilliance and you know
31:54 West world has that embedded inside of
31:56 itself so ed Harris is on this mission
31:59 to find something he calls the maze it
32:03 is assumed that over the 30 years that
32:05 he has done everything that can be done
32:09 someone has made it apparent that
32:13 there's the second level of the game a
32:16 much deeper level to the game and he's
32:19 trying to find the entry point to that
32:22 game the door to what they call the maze
32:25 I will tell you that you learn a lot
32:31 about it in season one but we're not
32:34 going to see it until season two and
32:36 that's the beautiful thing about it the
32:40 other beautiful thing is that the
32:41 characters are played by such incredible
32:43 actors that the slow reveal of all this
32:47 information and the writing is just
32:48 top-notch okay
32:50 it's a beautiful reveal the speed of it
32:55 is beautiful the way that they bring it
32:57 out to you slowly now on the outside you
33:00 have a whole set of politics going on
33:02 the outside which is unrelated to any
33:03 individual narrative inside Ford played
33:08 by Anthony Hopkins is obviously an old
33:10 man
33:11 he's been putting this thing together
33:13 forever it's unclear how many years the
33:16 the west-world has been online it would
33:20 seem that based on you know that the man
33:23 in blacks at Harris's character that it
33:26 was actually already pretty much in full
33:29 swing when he started going 30 years ago
33:32 Anthony Hopkins was old enough that if
33:34 you add his educational background and
33:36 the years it took to actually piss on
33:39 eyes this thing is a reality that it
33:41 could be maybe 35 years old the hell who
33:44 knows maybe you had one in the first
33:45 year though as with all major
33:48 corporations especially like an Apple
33:50 Computer the Board of Directors that
33:55 manage the money to expand a business
33:57 always want to get complete control over
33:59 the company and they are always
34:01 intimidated by the genius that gave them
34:03 the opportunity to have the financial
34:06 opportunities that they have this cash
34:08 cow that they have and so this is in
34:11 lost on West world there is a board of
34:15 directors that are always referenced by
34:17 name but never really you know that's
34:19 never shown and there's a couple days
34:22 ons that are part of the character base
34:25 that there's a female that is always
34:28 kind of running around watching the sort
34:30 of the productivity of the west-world
34:34 narratives of its cash flow of how much
34:36 is being spent to create new narratives
34:38 meaning new they'll actually terraform a
34:40 part of the park inside and create
34:43 cities and new caves and new experiences
34:46 and they create new characters as a
34:49 British guy who is maybe the worst actor
34:53 in the whole thing but he's been told to
34:55 overact everything and the dialogue for
34:57 him is actually really I think horribly
34:59 bad and if there's one point there's a
35:02 piercing of the suspension of disbelief
35:04 it's this particular actor overacting
35:07 everything and he's he's this
35:09 foul-mouthed
35:11 narrator writer so his whole job is to
35:14 create new scenarios and he seems to
35:16 miss the incomplete essence of what West
35:18 world is it would seem that he has never
35:20 actually gone in as a guest to himself
35:21 and lived for
35:23 through a couple weeks of the world
35:25 itself but all during season one because
35:29 season two doesn't exist there is this
35:32 sort of attempt to take away the park
35:36 from Fort from Anthony Hopkins to say
35:39 you got to retire you got to be out of
35:40 this game we're going to take over from
35:42 now but Anthony understands or dr.
35:45 Forrest say he understands that the
35:48 board of directors completely missed the
35:51 point of Westworld to essentially reveal
35:55 your internal character and your
35:56 internal capabilities and so he doesn't
36:00 want to give it up and of course he's
36:02 he's a brilliant brilliant human being
36:05 in this scenario and so he is thought of
36:08 a lot of things and so one of the one of
36:10 the nice things that starts occurring in
36:12 the second half of the first season is
36:14 you see all the provisions he has made
36:16 to make sure he doesn't lose control and
36:19 it's brilliant and is awesome he's also
36:23 working on an upgrade to the park a new
36:27 narrative and each each core narrative
36:30 has hundreds of small narratives as sort
36:33 of what you get out of it right so
36:34 there's a new world that's created it
36:36 has an objective for the players and as
36:39 he has perfected this I this methodology
36:42 of helping you understand who you are as
36:45 a human being he just gets better and
36:49 better in the stories you go deeper and
36:51 deeper to the characters that join this
36:55 particular scenario our two gentlemen
36:59 one guy has been there several times and
37:02 loves the place and understands
37:03 everything about it he is sort of you
37:09 could see he's obviously Ivy League he's
37:10 obviously very wealthy to be able to
37:12 afford to go into the park but for all
37:14 intents and purposes he is a degenerate
37:16 of morality and so he really wants to be
37:22 a bastard he really wants to be this
37:24 character and who knows affectionately
37:26 speaking if we were to go into that
37:27 scenario maybe we turned into that guy
37:28 anyway because it's the exact opposite
37:30 of what you're able to experience in
37:32 this world right
37:34 but he's bringing another gentleman with
37:36 him which is the Simpson actor and it's
37:42 it's it's a slow reveal as to what the
37:45 relationship is if you pay attention to
37:48 every single word they speak you'll get
37:49 it fairly early but I missed I'm
37:51 watching it for the second time through
37:52 right now
37:53 and because of the way we're sharing the
37:55 episodes with other individuals at the
37:56 smoke shop where I'm seeing virtually
38:00 every episode three times two to three
38:02 times and this rewatch so I'm getting to
38:04 watch it two three and four times again
38:07 which is great for me before this
38:09 episodes this particular recording but
38:13 the scenario between these two other
38:14 gentlemen is that the younger nerdier
38:16 guy who's got morals it's his first time
38:20 to west world and this other guy is his
38:24 soon-to-be brother-in-law because they
38:26 work together in a corporation and you
38:30 know it's just some bonding time before
38:32 they become family and you can assume
38:36 that you know this sort of experience
38:38 because this has happened a lot of times
38:40 in real life you take your future
38:41 brother-in-law out on a fishing trip on
38:43 some camping trip you get to know these
38:45 individuals and you're just trying to
38:49 find out you know what your what your
38:51 family's going to turn into by bringing
38:52 this other DNA into the circle right and
38:55 it's through these two talking to each
38:56 other that we find out the scenario that
38:58 this this world is about you finding out
39:00 who you are as a human being which is
39:03 very enticing and you know it's one
39:06 thing to come up with a neat premise to
39:08 say okay this is gonna be really cool is
39:09 gonna be Wes world and and I'm sure this
39:11 is in Crichton's book but you know
39:14 someone's saying you're going to find
39:15 out who you are that's an easy set up as
39:17 a writer pulling it off is a whole
39:19 nother thing and I'm going to tell you
39:21 right now they pull it off to the full
39:24 extent of its capability and so you will
39:27 be absolutely entertained beyond your
39:29 wildest dreams the other fabric to this
39:32 story is the interpersonal relationships
39:34 of all the staff members like I said
39:37 there's the two schmoes that take care
39:39 of the bodies and one seems to be very
39:42 just you know [ __ ] it da da da da da
39:46 this this white guy who's again
39:47 were acting all these lines and this
39:49 asian kid who's like very calm collected
39:53 you could tell he has a heart and he is
39:56 the one I always gravitate to and the
39:58 scene comes on because he has dimension
40:00 where this other guy is sort of a
40:01 Klingon right you know Star Trek was
40:03 never able to right dimension into a
40:04 Klingon I don't care what show you want
40:07 to pick out it's all shallow and super
40:09 predictable and sort of the cartoon
40:10 character of the series there's some
40:13 hidden romances between some of the
40:15 characters which creates an interesting
40:17 dynamic when it comes to someone getting
40:20 their way in the organization you know
40:22 if any of you've worked at a corporation
40:23 where the CEOs banging is secretary or
40:27 are some departmental head when the
40:31 departmental head is some can't
40:33 understand normal thinking person and
40:36 they they want to pull a fast one on
40:39 their employees and the CEO goes
40:41 whatever you want as long as you meet me
40:43 after work in between me singing my wife
40:46 and kids you can have whatever you want
40:48 so it's not quite that acidic in
40:50 Westworld its to single people for the
40:53 most part sharing their experiences
40:56 together but now here's where we're
40:59 going to take a little bit of a break
41:01 from narrating what the series is about
41:02 and I want to reflect on what this means
41:06 for us personally because towards the
41:09 second half of the first season Anthony
41:12 Hopkins has to reveal the philosophical
41:14 difference between he and his partner
41:16 Arnold so you have dr. Ford and this
41:20 partner that no longer exists called
41:22 Arnold and before we get to that one
41:26 reveal which i think is brilliant and
41:29 reveal at the right time in the series
41:31 but this won't hurt you at all watching
41:33 it we have this you know sort of
41:39 definitive definition of what makes us
41:41 human
41:42 thus real and what would make someone
41:44 else fake or not like us right we think
41:50 that if we are cut open and we bleed and
41:53 we have organic matter inside of our
41:54 bodies that we are definitely of the
41:57 soil and we we definitely spend time
42:00 with each other and believe
42:01 that we are born we believe our entire
42:03 child childhood existed we feel like we
42:06 have traversed time and earned our
42:10 stripes as a human being right I sit
42:13 before you right now making an episode
42:15 and I believe that I have the majority
42:17 of you know probably let's see 45 years
42:21 out of no sorry 42 years out of 47 years
42:25 of life memory is pretty pretty vividly
42:28 I remember I remember being three in a
42:30 ring too and so I think I have reality I
42:33 think I'm real what's interesting is
42:36 there was a there's a trial aids own
42:38 episode called sing the body electric
42:40 where they talk about the memory tracks
42:44 being installed inside of the nanny that
42:46 the mother dies early in this particular
42:49 Twilight Zone and the father is sort of
42:51 faced with the fact he's not
42:54 domesticated he has no idea to raise
42:55 children because in back in the
42:57 traditional day that the females had all
42:59 that in a tome in their genetic maternal
43:03 senses and so when she passes away the
43:06 father has to do something and they were
43:08 someone approaches the father and says
43:10 well you know there's this service where
43:12 you can have a human being built a robot
43:14 built that looks just as real as anyone
43:17 but it has memory tracks to make it feel
43:21 like it's real and so it goes back and
43:23 memorizes things now obviously that
43:25 whole timeline was then repeated in
43:29 philip k dick novel Do Androids Dream of
43:31 Electric Sheep which was then rewritten
43:34 into Blade Runner the movie and now
43:36 we've had this happen several times in
43:38 different narratives and different
43:40 movies right so pretty much the entire
43:43 dialogue from sing the body electric and
43:47 Blade Runner is repeated inside
43:49 Westworld
43:50 as the need to do this and again you
43:54 know I can't remember what the year is
43:56 on the west-world book I think it
43:58 precedes philip k dick snob I at least a
44:02 year or so but one of the two guys
44:04 really kind of latched on to this idea
44:05 from the Twilight Zone it took it
44:07 forward so
44:09 there becomes this philosophical
44:11 difference okay
44:12 and well to finish up another point real
44:16 quickly it's you know once you watch
44:19 Westworld you may look at your body and
44:22 your definition of being truly sentient
44:24 a little bit different again if you
44:27 watch those other pieces I just
44:28 mentioned you may have the same feeling
44:30 but what this all vectors up to in the
44:33 storyline is that Ford is more of the
44:37 non empathetic mathematician creator of
44:41 these hosts whereas Arnold his partner
44:44 who mysteriously dies in the park
44:48 believed that consciousness was
44:51 attainable by anything that emulates
44:54 life and so once you give any mechanical
44:59 device or organic night a device or some
45:02 hybrid thereof the ability to have
45:04 access to memories you give them the
45:08 tools to create consciousness to attain
45:12 consciousness now of course humans in
45:15 our hubris we want to believe that we
45:17 are billing ones that can do it but we
45:20 know animals do it if you ever come home
45:22 to your animal after a long stretch of
45:24 being away and your animal just cannot
45:26 get enough of you you know that animal
45:28 has the same powers that you do for
45:30 consciousness by the way I always
45:34 thought it was really strange I'm gonna
45:37 do a whole show on on what a soul is but
45:39 just as a small preview I always thought
45:42 it was very heartbreaking when as a
45:43 child when somebody would walk in and
45:45 say well animals don't have souls
45:47 I you know subliminally I just thought
45:51 as a child I couldn't articulate my
45:52 frustration but as I get older it's like
45:54 well how the [ __ ] do you know really
45:57 where's yours man show me if you got one
46:00 then they could have one hello spider
46:02 can have one you know but it's always to
46:06 make us special the church will always
46:08 lay down the law to make us special so
46:12 it it there's a point in the in the sort
46:16 of back story of Westworld between these
46:18 two scientists that founded West world
46:20 as to whether or not the objective of
46:22 creating
46:23 and programming these hosts was to go
46:25 into either a utilitarian mechanical
46:28 recreation of narratives for guests to
46:30 come in and experience things or whether
46:32 or not at some sweet spot in their
46:35 design and their capabilities they were
46:37 going to actually become real beings and
46:41 of course we see the programming that's
46:44 part of their being you know there's one
46:47 of the beautiful things about the series
46:48 is the production value is just BarNone
46:52 they have these iPad things that are you
46:54 know paper thin they kind of hold up in
46:57 little trifold wallet and the interface
47:00 that they create for these things I can
47:01 just tell use an engineer and knowing
47:04 enough about artificial intelligence to
47:05 be extremely dangerous they have done a
47:07 brilliant job with these interfaces and
47:09 packing these these command you know
47:14 consoles inside these iPads with
47:16 relevant information that matches our
47:18 current absolute state-of-the-art
47:20 understanding of artificial intelligence
47:22 it's really brilliant and breaking down
47:24 a human being to all these attributes
47:27 and these as fallout will call your
47:30 special attributes right strength
47:34 perception endurance intelligence
47:37 charisma agility luck all those things
47:42 right so what's what's phenomenal about
47:46 the the turn of the story as a whole for
47:49 all the participants is that you have
47:51 the hosts on the inside getting these
47:54 referees from floors and apparently
47:57 through this fly some residual code from
48:01 what might be a legacy Arnold code that
48:05 is still spreading around the park and
48:10 especially goes into overdrive at the
48:11 beginning of this series right on the
48:14 other side you have Ford who is very
48:17 lazy fair about it and says you know
48:19 don't worry these things will never gain
48:20 consciousness because it's impossible
48:23 but all of the staff members who are
48:26 dealing with all of these anomalies
48:27 getting out of hand where [ __ ] happens
48:29 it's never happened in the park where
48:31 hosts are starting to talk to themselves
48:33 and have conversations with characters
48:35 that aren't there
48:37 they tend to one of the big roof one of
48:39 the big things that I didn't see and
48:40 really make sense of until the third
48:42 time I watched one of the episodes was
48:45 that one of the hosts those often kills
48:48 a bunch of the other hosts and not some
48:52 of the hosts that are in the room and so
48:54 you'll hear the scientists say look I
48:56 did this cross-reference of this
48:58 particular hosts background and I
49:01 noticed that he killed a bunch of hosts
49:03 that had had attacked him in the past
49:05 and had murdered him in the past but he
49:07 left the other ones alone because they
49:08 had to head in the air at interaction
49:10 with him
49:10 so was as if he was correcting bad blood
49:13 you know you killed me a long time ago
49:16 so I'm going to get rid of you this time
49:17 around so there was this there's been
49:20 this sort of echoing with the Reverend
49:22 with the reveries there seems to be more
49:24 information traveling from the past to
49:27 the present
49:27 then the reveries were really meant to
49:29 do is really supposed to give you just
49:31 sort of a physical attributes sort of a
49:35 personality that you developed you know
49:37 in life we tend to hang on to things
49:39 that work right so if you're trying to
49:41 get the opposite sex or whatever you're
49:43 attracted to to pay attention to you and
49:46 use a couple lines use a couple
49:47 techniques and it works for you you're
49:49 going to bed that in your entire flow
49:51 until you find the one that you love and
49:52 you want to hang up your your black book
49:54 right what I get out of Westworld in the
49:58 end is essentially a big what-if
50:02 scenario for our world and I think it's
50:05 beautiful and I think it's very healthy
50:06 for us to have these questions from time
50:08 to time you know human beings like to
50:11 temper chaos in our scenarios of life by
50:14 claiming that somehow we figured it all
50:17 out
50:17 right the Big Bang satiates a bunch of
50:20 people who are apparently terrified
50:22 about how the universe started or they
50:25 want to create the perception that they
50:27 have such a profound understanding of
50:29 the universe that you must cower down to
50:31 their intelligence at all times
50:34 Westworld if you pay attention will do
50:37 that to you it will make you feel like
50:42 you know it'll make you question your
50:45 reality I think the more that you watch
50:46 it and again it's I want you to view
50:50 is world as a metaphorical possibility
50:52 of reality and not some literal
50:54 translation oh my god maybe I am inside
50:57 some flutter dome or something like that
50:59 it very well maybe it's very well maybe
51:03 the one thing I want to throw at you
51:05 just I'm going to throw at you a few
51:06 notions I guess that West world does not
51:10 address and that we don't typically
51:11 address impossible scenarios but imagine
51:14 this we we are born in this particular
51:16 reality and we have a life and we die no
51:19 matter how short it is or how long it is
51:20 you have those three beginning middle
51:22 and end scenarios right but what if
51:28 wherever we come from we don't die or we
51:32 live a lot longer than we know maybe we
51:35 live a thousand years something like
51:37 that
51:38 or perhaps in the matter of five seconds
51:42 there's technology that can make us feel
51:44 like we lived a hundred years and that
51:47 this is some virtual reality similar to
51:50 the way that the Total Recall movie in
51:51 1988 alluded to which is that you know
51:56 what what is always the same every time
51:58 you take a vacation and all sorts
52:00 [ __ ] is what this is you you're
52:03 always the same you're always you and
52:05 that's kind of boring how do you like to
52:08 be a rockstar a secret agent we will
52:12 change who you are within this memory
52:14 end point and you can be something
52:17 wonderful and in that particular movie
52:20 they back him into this device and you
52:22 know zap his temples to give them this
52:24 this trip and of course everything goes
52:25 wrong but eventually right away after he
52:28 wakes up out of the scenario he is the
52:31 special agent that he bought the trip to
52:33 do and again the big clue with Total
52:37 Recall is the nerd who puts the program
52:39 into the unit he looks at the unit and
52:42 he says Oh blue sky on Mars I haven't
52:45 seen this one before
52:46 and the end of the movie is a blue sky
52:49 on Mars so in my estimation the whole
52:52 thing is his trip and it ends exactly
52:55 the way that the episode was titled at
52:58 the beginning in the first act right
53:00 what's very interesting about
53:03 the west-world analogy to our world is
53:06 that when they're killing all these
53:08 hosts rather than you know most of them
53:10 haven't done anything to anyone they're
53:11 shooting people randomly in saloons you
53:14 know raping women that haven't done
53:16 anything to them they don't have the
53:18 guilt in their brain because they think
53:20 it's a host it's a disposable lighter
53:23 it's a disposable razor right it doesn't
53:27 have sentient life it has no
53:29 consciousness as dr. Ford a fictional
53:31 character who runs a place played by
53:33 Anthony Hopkins constantly says but
53:36 Arnold disagreed and so we find
53:39 ourselves in this world where we
53:41 struggle with a belief in God because
53:43 often the answer the excuse for not
53:45 believing in God is that children suffer
53:47 the people suffer and how could any
53:50 creator of any world allow that to occur
53:54 well in West world you take your
53:56 physical body inside this world so they
53:58 have to protect your mortal coil your
54:00 physical body inside this world the
54:02 bullets don't go through you
54:03 no host is going to stab you with a
54:06 knife know how this is going to choke
54:07 you out and so you're guaranteed safety
54:11 I know it's hard to believe that what if
54:13 were since we're essentially putting on
54:16 an H and D a head-mounted display like a
54:19 virtual reality pair of goggles that we
54:20 have today and the only thing that
54:24 penetrates the world that we're in is
54:26 our eyes which is why it's always
54:27 considered the Gateway to the soul when
54:31 we look in each other's eyes it's a very
54:32 special thing like I said run this
54:36 experiment if you haven't done it go to
54:38 someone that you love or like start
54:40 talking to them and then hold up your
54:42 finger just like this if you're watching
54:44 the video and block your eyes eyes with
54:47 your index finger such as you can't see
54:49 their eyes and and tell me how much of
54:51 the humanity and spiritual connection
54:54 you have with this individual disappears
54:56 because it does it incredibly disappears
54:59 and I think that that's a clue to who we
55:02 are as beings okay remember all the
55:06 Illuminati worshipping of eyes it always
55:11 seems that those in the know always seem
55:13 to worship the eyes what if that's the
55:15 big joke
55:16 what if the big joke is this world our
55:19 eyes are the only thing that's coming
55:20 from the previous world and we are
55:22 humanoid in the other world we have made
55:24 ourselves on our own image because this
55:27 is a simulation we find out who we
55:30 really are by suffering in this world we
55:32 find out who we are by dying in this
55:34 world why would God allow suffering well
55:37 because it's not real
55:39 in one sense of the term your real being
55:42 just simply pulls out of the HMDs right
55:44 you die in this world for whatever
55:45 reason your head just pops out of the
55:48 goggles in the other world and you're
55:50 fine and you have the memory of the
55:53 value of life because you lived it and
55:55 you lost it or perhaps before you lost
55:58 your life you lost others that you loved
56:00 I always mention from time to time the
56:03 movie thx 1-1 3-8 which is George
56:06 Lucas's student film that was made into
56:08 a feature film with Robert Duvall
56:12 amazing movie one thing about that movie
56:16 is that the world has turned into this
56:17 fascist society I run as bald heads
56:19 there were white sheets the police
56:21 officers are sort of like these bike
56:24 cops with chrome faces and they wear a
56:26 police labor like biker helmets they hit
56:29 you with cattle prods and electric that
56:32 one seems to go to work do this weird
56:33 task to kind of keep this ecosystem
56:35 together whatever the hell they are
56:37 whatever the hell they're doing and
56:39 where would you know well we know that
56:41 there are definitely people on this
56:43 planet that would like to take well
56:45 after reducing the world population by
56:46 98 to 99 percent they'd love to have
56:49 everyone else be minions like that well
56:51 they live and sip champagne and look at
56:53 the coast
56:54 now that ship would get old too but
56:57 we'll overlook that for now but what
56:59 sort of entertainment would be created
57:01 if that's how mundane world bit the
57:04 world became on the outside maybe this
57:07 world right here would be the way we
57:10 would be entertained maybe there's some
57:12 way we can be in this world and just
57:14 like the matrix we are doing something
57:15 on the outside becoming a battery or
57:17 something that serves them and so we're
57:20 in this delusional world here honestly
57:23 more happy than we would be if we were
57:24 to wake up in the matrix just like neo
57:26 you went to a [ __ ] world no matter how
57:28 you want to
57:29 why sit but some of us would rather be
57:33 in the truth of the capital t to be in a
57:36 fiction with a capital F right so if you
57:39 haven't seen the HBO original series
57:40 Westworld I would definitely recommend
57:42 it with two thumbs up I dearly hope this
57:46 season 2 is as rewarding a season one I
57:49 don't think I thought I was going to
57:52 give you a lot of spoilers in this
57:53 particular episode but what I think I've
57:54 done is really just set it up for you if
57:56 you haven't watched the series because
57:58 believe me I haven't covered any of the
58:00 coolness in any of the episodes at all
58:03 as a matter of fact I've deciphered what
58:05 you might miss in just a single viewing
58:07 of the show now I have on my as a slight
58:11 disclaimer here at the end I have on my
58:13 list of shows to make one called
58:16 Hollywood themes I will definitely tell
58:19 you that the themes that we are
58:20 concerned about to come out of Hollywood
58:21 especially out of HBO are in are in very
58:27 very lightly inside of West world and so
58:31 there's a lot of I think depopulation
58:35 sort of you know sexual identification
58:39 misleading themes in this particular
58:41 thing from time to time it's actually
58:42 very very minimal out of these episodes
58:45 are long man I mean these episodes are
58:47 like 72 minutes long apiece so you'll be
58:49 in you'll be seeing little movies every
58:52 time you see one of the episodes so you
58:56 know I would watch it as an adult to
58:58 make a decision before you bring in your
59:00 your children because they'll see things
59:03 and I think that I think my big thing
59:06 about the Hollywood themed episode when
59:08 I get it done will be that we need to as
59:11 parents either shelter our children from
59:13 these things until they can understand
59:14 them or if you're going to allow them to
59:15 see them you will want to explain what
59:21 they're seeing from time to time it's a
59:23 very tough tough thing because
59:25 especially if you have more than one
59:27 child they're definitely you know
59:29 minimum of like you know usually 1012
59:31 months apart from each other and so the
59:33 level of maturity from one child to the
59:35 next is different now a lot of it could
59:37 be that they're not going to watch the
59:41 show and listen to it but they'll be in
59:42 the room
59:43 but I can tell you there are certain
59:44 scenes where they look at the television
59:47 screen and they don't know any of the
59:50 context of what they're saying they'll
59:51 definitely be extra confused so I'm
59:54 going to I'm going to really suggest
59:56 that you as an adult watch this show and
59:58 just apply some of that logic to what
60:01 you're seeing I think that's about it I
60:05 hope you dig that show and I hope you
60:08 connect this episode to it anyway that's
60:11 the end of this one deep thoughts radio
60:13 com for all the fees there's video if
60:15 you're on audio Aude if you're on video
60:16 if you want to watch season one
60:18 unimpeded go to vid got me I just got
60:20 the show up on Google podcasts so I
60:24 don't know if you guys use that source
60:25 but it's another place you can go to get
60:26 the feed iTunes also has the feed if
60:29 you're on Apple that's it take care of
60:32 yourself as someone else and I'll see
60:33 you in the next two thoughts over now
60:36 [Music]
60:46 Oh
