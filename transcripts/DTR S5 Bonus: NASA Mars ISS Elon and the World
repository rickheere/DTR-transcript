00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen
00:34 to an all-new nasa episode
00:38 so perseverance was just launched to
00:41 mars the other day
00:44 okay what else we have going on in the
00:47 old
00:48 space arena we've got
00:51 a bunch of new chatter coming out
00:54 talking about
00:56 uh china's capabilities in space
01:00 yet they're still trying to build the
01:02 engines for the raptors that they stole
01:04 but they can't do it because they don't
01:06 have precision technology and know-how
01:09 it's funny when you steal all the
01:10 outside stuff but you can't steal the
01:11 inside stuff
01:15 they were i forgot who it was but they
01:16 were relying on some i think european
01:18 company to build the engines for them
01:20 and i think that maybe america went to
01:21 them and said
01:22 don't be building them engines for our
01:24 plane because then your co-conspirator
01:28 in the theft of the plane's design
01:32 but i listened to an interview a friend
01:33 sammy
01:35 and the interview was all about whether
01:37 or not america was going to get into a
01:39 war with china
01:41 and it was a i think it was
01:45 it was on um brighton
01:49 i just don't trust that platform i think
01:51 it's a deep state platform
01:53 and i know that they constantly preach
01:55 that they're not but then one doth
01:56 protest too much sometimes
01:58 but the interview was very um
02:01 infomercial shamwow
02:03 you know some guy calling the other dude
02:05 by the first name constantly and then
02:07 his
02:08 the entire interview was formulaically
02:10 designed to be
02:12 the psyop guy coming on there trying to
02:15 gain credibility
02:17 with how much he hates the government
02:19 and then
02:20 the things he's done you know it was all
02:22 just
02:24 kind of dopey stories it wasn't anything
02:26 like you're a huge whistleblower you
02:28 haven't really affected change in the
02:29 world
02:30 i don't know could be real but again
02:32 when nothing profound is said but
02:34 everyone in the interview is acting like
02:35 something profound
02:36 that's targeted at a much lower audience
02:40 of just sort of like man did you hear
02:42 that
02:44 but anyway part of it was that
02:48 supposedly okay
02:51 and i'm gonna qualify this as soon as i
02:53 say this
02:55 well let me actually qualify it while i
02:57 say it here you go 1987 the united
02:59 states of america
03:00 deployed star wars into space told the
03:02 public that it was canceled
03:04 but it was completely perfected and it's
03:06 a multi-layer system
03:08 we have satellites up there that have
03:10 missiles on them we have satellites up
03:11 there that have
03:13 laser systems that rotate that use the
03:16 van allen belts for free energy
03:18 we have bombers that have missiles in
03:21 them
03:21 that icbms that can just go up into the
03:25 air
03:26 drop it out of the bay boom we have
03:28 missiles that come out of missile silos
03:30 why do the bombers versus the ground i
03:32 think it's because of detection reasons
03:34 whatever this is 87 technology so i
03:37 don't think i'm
03:39 knocking at any major technical briefs
03:42 i've never talked about anything that
03:43 i may have learned in the recent years
03:45 right but in this interview it was as if
03:48 in the 30 years of you know various
03:51 presidents selling us out to
03:54 our enemies that they were able to
03:56 master all this technology
03:59 you might get a copy of one and fire it
04:01 and oh see we got that it's like it's
04:02 still right out of our inventory
04:04 you know so whatever but it was that we
04:07 could be attacked with an emp
04:10 missile hey that could happen
04:14 you know uh that all of our submarines
04:18 are deterrence right submarines were
04:20 supposed to be you know in the ocean
04:23 incapable of detection
04:26 and so you know stealthing is submarine
04:30 in the water is you know got all kinds
04:33 of vectors of
04:36 requirements boat to boat you know
04:38 submarine to some rain surface boat to
04:40 submarine
04:40 satellite to submarine aircraft to
04:43 submarine
04:44 ground penetrating stuff to submarine i
04:46 mean there's all kinds of different
04:47 things
04:47 you could triangulate a submarine with
04:50 so if those are truly
04:52 exposed to the enemy which they said
04:54 that uh and the previous administration
04:57 all that information was just flat out
04:59 given to china
05:01 and so they are able to and unless the
05:03 current administration has been able to
05:05 re-scam scramble all the codes
05:07 and figure out ways of beating their own
05:09 technology and going to the next level
05:14 we could be eternally exposed until we
05:16 can develop new technology as a result
05:19 of an acting president selling us
05:22 literally selling this
05:23 you give me personal money on the side
05:25 and i'll make sure that these
05:27 workers from china can infiltrate our
05:30 organizations
05:31 and steal everything which is why right
05:33 now we have a big lockdown going on
05:35 between our two countries
05:36 all right but let's take some inventory
05:40 too
05:40 and that where is america america is
05:43 beautifully on the other side of the
05:44 atlantic ocean meaning if you were to
05:46 come here we'd see you coming for days
05:49 and weeks right now missile
05:51 depending on how fast it can go and how
05:53 beautiful it is i can get here pretty
05:54 quickly
05:56 but split seconds are all the satellites
05:59 and space need
06:00 to literally splice and dice the
06:03 incoming missiles into pieces
06:06 before it's ever able to detonate
06:09 the atlantic is a much shorter distance
06:12 than the pacific of course but then
06:14 we're
06:14 fairly good friends with our tyrannical
06:17 neighbors
06:18 better known as europe
06:22 and i want to state before we do this
06:23 episode just to give you a little chat
06:25 ski to take with you
06:27 as i said in one of my last two episodes
06:29 here i've done a few
06:30 out of order here the most tyranny on
06:34 planet earth
06:36 the most pain and suffering craziness on
06:39 planet earth is all happened in europe
06:42 they still have the kings and queens
06:44 right if you were to evolve away from
06:48 tyranny you would have no kings and
06:49 queens anymore but they still keep them
06:51 and they still have
06:52 complete immunity legal immunity right
06:56 if they're truly at your level then they
06:58 don't have
06:59 legal immunity from any crime that they
07:01 commit but they do
07:04 so just keep that in the back of your
07:05 head as you traverse life
07:08 america is the only place where magna
07:10 carta has
07:11 lasted over 200 years
07:15 back to space so nasa as an organization
07:19 has been say relatively quiet we
07:22 certainly haven't heard any more
07:24 big announcements about going back to
07:26 the moon in four years time
07:30 hate to remind you but i said to you
07:33 guys that they would say 2024
07:35 if they knew something was going to
07:37 happen to make it
07:39 not happen they could blame
07:43 and then it was then it was
07:47 pushed out like 10 years then it was 20
07:49 30
07:50 you know six and then i got pushed out
07:52 another time so i mean
07:54 i don't know who to believe anymore it's
07:55 definitely not going to be taking place
07:57 anytime soon
07:59 what else is going on in space we have
08:02 the comment that just went by
08:04 whoopty do seen uh i've seen haley's
08:07 comment the hellbop comment
08:10 they're cool but you know you do right
08:14 we have a network of
08:18 what is it uh tens of thousands of
08:21 satellites being launched by spacex
08:23 to create a grid over earth and nobody
08:26 thinks that's a bad idea
08:29 we have a huge supposedly and again i
08:32 know some of you are like space doesn't
08:33 exist
08:35 hope the intro doesn't uh tick you off
08:37 or thank you for
08:38 tolerating the intro half the intros
08:41 flat earth just so you know
08:44 our little segment is
08:48 you know in fact for folks that don't
08:49 believe that satellites are real
08:51 which i think is a tiny group of you but
08:53 i respect you know
08:55 your balls to say stuff like that in
08:57 public
08:59 if you don't believe that they exist
09:02 then
09:02 you're probably in for a horrible
09:05 surprise in your future
09:06 going why am i on fire you know
09:10 why is all this happening to my country
09:13 why did all the electricity go out why
09:14 is this why is that and it's all because
09:16 of
09:17 upper atmosphere objects hovering up
09:19 there
09:20 however they do you know official word
09:22 is they're in orbit
09:23 right international space station i
09:27 haven't heard a lot about that either
09:28 once uh the fuse was lit on exposing
09:32 that
09:33 object in space and again apparently
09:37 there's an object in space that sort of
09:38 matches the
09:40 configuration maybe it's really there as
09:43 we
09:43 know it on tv
09:47 but i mean a space station
09:51 that looks like an absolute
09:55 dorm room of like a freshman like like i
09:58 don't know how many guys are on there
09:59 20 slobs up there i mean the place is a
10:03 crapple it's totally unorganized whoever
10:06 designed it i mean
10:07 give me a break
10:11 you know hair everywhere big giant
10:13 hairdos all
10:14 uh hair sprayed out to make it look like
10:16 in in 0g
10:18 people on invisible harnesses you've
10:20 been through all this
10:22 if you dig those kind of conversations
10:23 definitely go to deepthoughtsradio.com
10:25 and click on nasa
10:28 here's 89 episodes with nasa content in
10:31 it
10:33 but there's an iss one up there the only
10:36 portal window in the whole space station
10:40 faces earth
10:42 which we you would want one to space uh
10:44 face earth
10:45 space earth face earth but you would
10:47 want
10:48 one or two to go towards space wouldn't
10:50 you
10:53 if somebody were to say let's just say
10:55 let's just make this easy
10:56 you've got a little kid he or she
10:58 doesn't matter both kids
11:00 are both genders are totally into
11:01 science and space
11:03 and they said mom dad i'm gonna design a
11:06 space station
11:08 okay you go for it we'll be right here
11:10 when you get done don't you think they
11:14 put an observatory
11:16 on it or windows towards space
11:20 wouldn't you think that they'd want to
11:22 go get a really good shot of the moon
11:24 i mean come on you're up there you
11:27 passed a lot of the thicker atmosphere
11:29 should be a clear shot nope
11:32 it's designed by apparently a group of
11:35 monkeys
11:36 that want you to review their version of
11:39 shakespeare they've come up with
11:42 so what's interesting about perseverance
11:47 the rover going towards mars right now
11:52 supposedly well it's the biggest rover
11:56 that we've ever put on mars
11:59 that we will have put on mars
12:02 i don't think we're on mars just you
12:04 know if this is your first episode
12:07 i don't think we've ever been to mars
12:10 ever
12:12 as the hollywood software like terrigen
12:16 gains capabilities and features so too
12:19 does the detail of the imagery that nasa
12:22 brings back
12:25 now what nasa has done is a bunch of
12:27 wild stuff plus i mean jpl
12:29 that's jpl is probably the image factory
12:34 they've shown us 4k images 20 years ago
12:40 but it wasn't 4k detail in the image
12:43 believe it or not today they just
12:45 announced or yesterday
12:47 4k images of of the mar of mars in
12:50 general right
12:52 and now it's all of a sudden looks a lot
12:54 better
12:57 did we just deliver brand new cameras up
13:00 there
13:00 i don't know
13:04 up rest
13:07 the more you know my buddies have been
13:10 using terrigen for films
13:12 they just keep giving me calls and
13:14 literally saying dude nothing is real i
13:16 mean all that space stuff is completely
13:17 fake and i'm like why do you say that
13:19 all of a sudden
13:20 so confidently and some of these dudes
13:23 have been to nasa at the deepest
13:26 top secret level right
13:29 and they said look uh i just created
13:31 what i
13:32 see on nasa's website i just did it to
13:35 see if i could do it
13:37 and it looks exactly the same
13:40 like damn okay
13:44 now again spacex uh
13:47 aka nasa and cooperation
13:50 did a little video
13:53 i guess uh two months ago i mentioned
13:55 this in my latest
13:57 last nasa episodes i want to mention it
13:59 again
14:00 because it's going to coincide with how
14:02 you're going to think about perseverance
14:04 landing on mars
14:09 now again one of the things that we have
14:11 accepted because of science fiction
14:13 movies all the way back to like
14:17 that was a journey to the moon but
14:19 definitely
14:20 in buck rogers from the 1930s
14:24 and all the films up that aren't flying
14:26 saucer based
14:27 spacecraft anytime you see an engine
14:29 blowing fire
14:31 in space coming out of a cone
14:34 that is typically where we are
14:36 indoctrinated into believing that that
14:38 technique would work in space
14:40 in the vacuum space now i will tell you
14:44 that there's no such thing as a true
14:45 vacuum
14:46 in the universe unless there is some
14:49 massive anomaly with the
14:52 subatomic particles
14:56 that make up all things
15:00 if we had a vacuum okay in space
15:03 a pure vacuum you wouldn't be able to
15:05 see any stars
15:06 there'd be no medium by which that
15:08 energy could get to us
15:10 the ripples in the pond are
15:13 the exact same thing that photons are
15:17 so there is no true vacuum in space
15:20 that's just a provable thing because you
15:21 can see starlight
15:23 even if when you're in space if you had
15:27 vacuumless
15:28 uh if you had a vacuum let's just say
15:31 and no i mean i guess you know they
15:33 always say that look when you're in
15:34 space you can't see stars
15:35 that's bs because your eyeball has its
15:37 own atmosphere in it
15:39 and as soon as it hits the lens in your
15:41 eyeball it's going to refract and hit
15:43 your
15:43 rods and your cones and it will create a
15:45 depression
15:47 due to sheer force and you will start
15:49 seeing what's up there
15:51 so the fact that nasa never has any
15:53 stars in any of their photographs
15:55 is a large indicator that they have a
15:57 studio by which they cannot simulate the
15:59 star pattern
16:01 because it's too complex because you'd
16:03 have to rotate it around
16:05 as the stars rotate in space the other
16:08 thing is
16:09 they know that there are anomalies in
16:11 space that they cannot
16:12 account for so imagine they've got some
16:16 crazy star projector or some blue
16:20 screening technology that is going to
16:22 try and simulate the stars
16:24 in the underwater set that is the isis
16:27 a lot of the isis isis iss excuse me
16:31 iss um space walks and a lot of those
16:34 fake shots where the earth is like
16:36 this tiny little ball and it you know in
16:37 real life be right on top of it
16:41 because 250 miles up ain't nothing
16:44 on a 8 000 mile around ball okay but
16:50 what if a little meteorite
16:52 is being tracked by some students in
16:54 germany let's just say as an example
16:56 and they discovered that there's some
16:58 anomaly coming in some meteorite just
17:00 gets caught on a p
17:01 p on a photograph and then nasa is
17:03 trying to fake it in the studio
17:06 and over there should be that little
17:07 anomaly but
17:10 they're not feeding it live they're
17:11 using computer simulation of where they
17:14 know stars to be in the sky and their
17:15 various brightnesses and what have you
17:19 and what technology would you use you
17:21 can't use an led screen
17:25 it's too it's too specific
17:29 to the shape of the screen versus where
17:30 the camera is at so you can't have any
17:33 perspective on a movie screen
17:36 so the only thing you can really do
17:40 would be to do some sort of
17:44 blue screen technology green screen
17:46 technology
17:47 and the problem about blue screen and
17:49 green screen
17:51 is that you must light those surfaces in
17:53 order to have those
17:55 channels go into the camera to then be
17:58 subtracted out
18:00 well lighting the background is going to
18:01 like the rest of the stage
18:05 that's why it's difficult to do a night
18:07 shot with blue screen
18:09 as a part of the set without a lot of
18:11 post processing
18:13 and they want to do this stuff live so
18:15 the kids can watch it and everything and
18:17 feel like
18:17 we're really there that's a problem
18:20 same reason why no debris ever fell off
18:23 the
18:24 second trade center
18:27 because that was real-time cg and you
18:30 can't real-time cg
18:31 at least in 2001 a fuselage telescoping
18:35 into a building
18:36 and having debris fall on that side plus
18:39 what's going to be on the ground in real
18:40 life if you just did a cg shot
18:42 up in the sky you'd have to have stuff
18:44 on the ground if something you know you
18:46 watch it on tv
18:47 that stuff is falling out of the sky but
18:49 you go outside nothing's falling out of
18:50 the sky
18:51 you know that tv is all simulated
18:54 problem the other thing that seems to
18:57 just blow me away
18:58 is that when you do see tours of the iss
19:01 which some of them are
19:03 horrible and some of them are very
19:04 convincing
19:07 very sandra bullock you know inside
19:09 gravity
19:12 they're trying to show you what
19:14 experiments they're doing up there like
19:15 why are we paying for this gigantic
19:18 structure in space are we paying for
19:21 that it's it's
19:21 putting people in danger particularly
19:24 potentially excuse me
19:25 you know science you know scientists
19:27 with no gravity on their body lose bone
19:29 density and
19:30 who knows what's going on in their
19:31 system plus getting there safely
19:33 bringing them home safely
19:36 a lot of us watch the uh the falcon 9
19:41 system deliver the astronauts in those
19:43 goofy ass spacesuits
19:45 i mean those spacesuits were just like
19:47 nasa's given up
19:49 on even trying uh to try and convince
19:52 the smart people
19:53 that we're really there because they
19:55 know i'm making this up but
19:57 i think that they know that most of us
19:59 who are intelligent look at this going
20:02 that's a horrible impersonation of a
20:04 spacesuit and nasa is going
20:06 back the other way yeah but most people
20:08 believe it
20:09 you know all right you're right
20:14 you are right people see what they want
20:17 to believe in right
20:20 the one thing that i i bring up from
20:22 time to time is that
20:23 and this is not my epiphany whatsoever
20:26 but it's one that the one that didn't
20:29 hit me as hard when i first heard it but
20:31 now that i'm repeating it to people
20:33 it's sort of laughable and hilarious and
20:35 if you have
20:36 evidence to the contrary please get it
20:40 to me somehow
20:43 but i have never seen personally okay
20:47 any shots of them assembling the iss
20:51 which quite frankly would be one of the
20:53 most miraculous
20:56 space labs in recorded history
21:00 where is the footage of putting these
21:01 modules together
21:04 and there's always this picture of the
21:07 space station
21:08 in space from above which means the
21:11 earth is down below
21:12 as the backdrop the space shuttle
21:16 from what i know we can remember every
21:18 single time it's ever touched the space
21:19 station before they cancel the program
21:21 it always approached from the bottom
21:24 never approached from the top
21:25 how could you possibly have the space
21:27 shuttle above the space station
21:30 and somehow get it underneath the space
21:31 station to do a dock
21:33 doesn't make any sense
21:37 a good friend of mine always reminds me
21:39 too
21:41 because he remembers watching the uh the
21:44 moon
21:44 landing on tv as he got older
21:50 and had to you know peel away from his
21:53 previous beliefs and
21:55 you know it's rough man it's rough when
21:58 you have to let go
22:01 but he focuses on the fact that
22:04 hollywood was definitely hired to create
22:07 a romantic setting for the saturn v
22:09 to light it properly to take photographs
22:11 of it at night to really romanticize it
22:14 so because he's in hollywood
22:17 an award-winning cg artist okay
22:20 today he's like yeah i see it all now i
22:23 see the whole pipeline of all things
22:25 at this point but i saw this interview
22:29 i've mentioned it before in the last
22:30 episode
22:33 they've admitted again we never went to
22:35 the moon for sure
22:38 and again before i make this point
22:42 you would test these rovers on the moon
22:47 especially before you go there again
22:49 supposedly right
22:51 you'd go up you put a rover on the moon
22:53 and you would drive up to all the
22:54 landing sites
22:56 it's much smaller than mars okay
23:01 so huge you just land it and see a train
23:04 quality where it's nice and smooth
23:06 you know far enough away from the other
23:08 landing sites that you're not going to
23:09 run into any peril
23:12 and just drive over to them and say hi
23:14 there they are
23:15 because all you're going to see is the
23:16 kickstand of the lunar lander
23:18 and the american flag and for 15 16 17
23:22 you would see a moon buggy
23:25 okay they don't even try
23:29 because it's not there that's why
23:34 but nasa had to admit that this
23:36 perseverance is the heaviest rover they
23:38 can send to mars
23:40 because the atmosphere isn't thick
23:42 enough to handle with current booster
23:44 technology
23:45 a heavier payload screaming down to the
23:49 surface so all those rockets that you
23:50 see in the cg animations right
23:52 i remember people posting
23:56 the cg of landing a rover on mars last
24:00 time they did it
24:01 as actual footage literally in the
24:03 captions this is actually just like
24:06 one who would be taking a shot genius
24:08 and two
24:10 you know it's like in the corner we'll
24:12 say you know animation recreation or
24:13 whatever simultaneously
24:15 it's unbelievable right so that's the
24:18 intellectual capacity
24:20 of the individuals validating this fake
24:23 situation
24:26 now i'm guessing that the apollo lunar
24:29 lander
24:30 with two guys in it plus uh
24:33 a 700 pound okay
24:36 uh moon buggy in 15 16 17 having not
24:40 increased the f1 booster the rocketdyne
24:43 boosters they didn't make them stronger
24:45 they didn't redesign the platform when
24:47 the first launch happened
24:49 the thing that they said on the news and
24:51 this is a bit of an exaggeration but
24:53 they're trying to make a point they said
24:54 you couldn't put a paperclip
24:57 on that rocket without disturbing the
24:59 chance of them getting to the moon
25:01 because it was so perfectly balanced
25:03 right
25:04 and you hear this all the time that boy
25:06 the first one was just
25:07 the first one is where they made all the
25:09 mistakes and then the second
25:11 uh so 17 minus 13 of course
25:15 got there it's just like dudes where is
25:18 the giant
25:19 leap in technology why were
25:24 russia's boosters phenomenally more
25:27 powerful than our f1 boosters
25:30 remember two and a half times more
25:31 powerful than nasa's best booster in
25:33 1995
25:35 was the booster strength that russia had
25:38 achieved in 1972
25:41 and they said they couldn't get there
25:42 mathematically
25:44 they did have a giant explosion
25:49 so i mean the saturn v is an amazing
25:50 rocket let's just not forget that these
25:53 these are amazing people that did what
25:55 they did but
25:56 gus grissom was murdered and his two
26:00 partners murdered on the tarmac i think
26:03 the day before the apollo 1 was supposed
26:05 to do a launch
26:08 they gave him cyanide through their
26:09 oxygen tubes which is why their bodies
26:11 are just sitting there
26:13 burned right you got a blast hatch right
26:15 here
26:16 you couldn't get out but you could at
26:17 least uh get rid of a fire and a fire
26:20 requires oxygen right
26:21 do we all know basic chemistry fires
26:23 need oxygen
26:24 why do you throw a towel on a fire if
26:27 you can't
26:28 because you rob it of oxygen and the
26:30 fire goes out
26:32 okay sounds good to me it's pretty much
26:34 my experience with life
26:36 so you got a cockpit full of oxygen
26:40 now obviously there's some sort of
26:42 source but these guys are also in
26:43 spacesuits
26:45 so they're all closed up they're their
26:46 own little ecosystems right
26:50 and they're sitting there burned to
26:51 death having not moved
26:53 they're still seat belted in all you do
26:55 is hit the little
26:57 release tab on their chest poof pops off
27:00 someone grabs the
27:01 the tnt bolted door boom that pops off
27:04 and at least they can stick their head
27:06 out
27:06 like someone in an apartment complex
27:08 whether their apartment's on fire
27:11 none of that took place the official
27:13 report is that their bodies had cyanide
27:15 in them
27:15 this is the 11 inch report that was
27:17 given to gus grissom's wife
27:21 all right do you ever hear about that
27:25 keep your mouth shut or we'll turn off
27:27 your husband's pension
27:29 get your living off of but so
27:34 moon has no atmosphere of any measurable
27:38 level now technically speaking
27:40 i don't know what it would hold onto its
27:42 surface it's so crystal clear when we
27:44 look at it through telescopes
27:46 that that's really the indication that
27:47 there's not much of any registrable
27:49 atmosphere
27:50 so now you're screaming at the surface
27:54 and you're firing your booster what's
27:56 the booster pushing off of
27:58 as admitted in this perseverance launch
28:01 plan
28:02 they can't send up anything heavier than
28:04 the perseverance
28:06 otherwise it'll crash into the surface
28:08 but what do you think
28:09 what do you think do you think the ten
28:10 thousand pound thrust engine on the
28:12 bottom of the lunar lander
28:13 is more powerful than all the motors and
28:16 boosters that are used on the
28:18 perseverance landing mechanism right now
28:20 on the mars project
28:23 some 50 years later
28:27 what do you think i'm going to give nasa
28:29 credit that
28:30 that they have boosters right now
28:34 and i believe there's like four minimum
28:36 of four they're going to fire
28:37 when this thing starts screaming at mars
28:39 right
28:42 and that's it they've hit their maximum
28:46 immediately invalidates the moon
28:47 missions for a whole other
28:50 boatload of reasons and it also means
28:53 that in space okay firing an engine
28:57 without an atmosphere
28:59 again it's not a vacuum but it's in
29:01 terms of a motor
29:02 in space it's it's a vacuum you're not
29:04 pushing off of anything
29:06 you can blow all the fire that little
29:08 cone you want it's not going to stop
29:10 it's not going to change course you're
29:12 going in that direction
29:13 and unless you can push off of something
29:15 not yourself
29:16 okay you're not going to do anything
29:19 you're going to have to create a whole
29:20 new
29:21 engine system to land on foreign bodies
29:26 and maybe they've got that technology
29:27 too some anti-gravity thing which we've
29:29 talked about several times
29:32 let's go back to the satellite
29:33 conversation as we bop around here
29:37 current threats to america all right
29:41 well i do think that there is a bit of a
29:44 tongue-in-cheek process going on when it
29:47 comes to america
29:48 and say like russia russia is the only
29:50 one that's the real competitor we're
29:54 pretending not to like each other
29:56 because one party
29:59 in our country of america has literally
30:02 taken the cold war out of the mothball
30:05 playbook and injected it into society
30:08 again such that we're now hating the
30:10 russias again
30:11 if you're russian you need to understand
30:16 america loves you yeah your president's
30:19 a gangster
30:20 and he's he's been through a lot in his
30:22 lifetime to
30:24 to rescue the country the country is
30:26 prospering
30:27 yeah i'm pretty sure it's probably the
30:28 wild wild west and a lot of areas over
30:30 there
30:30 hey you know you're doing your thing but
30:33 we don't have to be involved with your
30:34 country
30:36 to like you but we don't buy it
30:39 maybe maybe there's a war world war iii
30:42 coming and it's all russia against the
30:44 united states
30:45 that'd be a shock to me
30:48 i think europe messes with russia more
30:50 than america does
30:51 right but they're even in you know
30:53 germany's buying
30:54 uh oil from russia that's what we should
30:58 be doing we should all be working
30:59 together
31:00 to have a good time to enjoy the surface
31:02 of the earth
31:06 china don't know man they're really
31:08 trying to throw down hardcore in so many
31:10 different sectors
31:11 it's just it's really kind of shocking
31:14 to be honest you know they're getting
31:16 into everyone's backyard
31:18 there's fights on the china-india border
31:21 they're picking a big fight in the
31:22 pacific ocean against all those
31:24 countries down there
31:25 that are allied with the united states
31:27 they're messing with taiwan again
31:30 trying to say that that was their land
31:31 to begin with and it's like oh my god
31:33 you know
31:34 it proves you don't need a bible or
31:36 quran to hang on to ancient
31:39 concepts of what is yours and what is
31:42 theirs
31:43 you can just dial back and revise your
31:45 history to go grab something
31:47 on a full-blown atheist communistic
31:49 level
31:50 you get the same horrible
31:53 you know acidic situation
31:58 but we do have a tremendous amount of
31:59 space literally speaking
32:02 between say china and the united states
32:05 the pacific ocean and i guarantee you if
32:08 they're pushing satellites into space
32:10 and pushing them over
32:11 our country i guarantee they're going to
32:14 get wiped out
32:15 really quickly even approaching the
32:17 united states they're going to get wiped
32:19 out
32:22 this technology has advanced 30
32:26 plus years since we had the technology
32:29 completely perfected
32:31 to shoot anything out of space you know
32:34 we keep
32:35 being told this uh thing and i barely
32:37 ever mention it
32:39 but we have tens of thousands of objects
32:42 supposedly in space as space debris
32:46 the iss is just up there without any
32:48 issue never has any collision with
32:50 anything
32:51 which is sort of laughable right
32:54 everything that's
32:55 because you might think well maybe the
32:56 particles are higher
32:58 up they have a bigger orbit and you
33:01 would probably be correct
33:02 in a lot of those pieces and parts what
33:05 happens to an orbit every single time
33:08 it deteriorates a little bit every time
33:11 it loops the earth it deteriorates even
33:13 if it's in geocentric
33:14 it's still looping it's just looping at
33:16 the exact same speed
33:18 as the earth turning so that it's always
33:20 over a target
33:23 okay all right
33:26 but imagine you know you just take some
33:29 of this
33:30 these weapons and you can't tell the
33:31 public that this is a current
33:35 but if you you know there's supposedly a
33:37 database i've seen it several times you
33:38 guys have probably visited in your web
33:40 browser and it shows earth and it shows
33:41 all those
33:43 the space junk around earth it's all
33:45 accounted for
33:47 okay what if you just send up some of
33:50 our weaponized satellites
33:52 and we just start shooting them out of
33:54 the sky boom boom boom boom boom boom
33:55 you start blowing everything up
33:57 and it accounts for some of the gigantic
34:00 meteors we've seen
34:03 over russia over you know various
34:07 rural areas where people are really
34:08 clean shots and most of it just burns up
34:10 in the atmosphere apparently the one
34:13 over russia you know landed in a lake
34:15 supposedly but then again i
34:16 would probably not believe anything
34:18 about that
34:20 but you can't tell everybody you're
34:22 you're you know playing
34:24 was it uh space battle from
34:27 television whatever it was a little
34:29 cursor and just shooting everything else
34:31 guy but that's really what we should do
34:32 shouldn't we
34:35 shoot things and vaporize them
34:37 completely
34:38 use directed energy weapons towards the
34:41 space debris
34:42 so you have a big piece of aluminum
34:45 will you dial the energy weapon to
34:48 resonate at aluminum
34:50 and you just hit that thing and it's
34:52 going to atomize into its
34:53 subparticles there you go
34:57 turn it into thermal energy just
34:59 vaporizes right
35:01 plus you're testing your technology
35:03 making safe and space
35:04 space a safer place right
35:07 the other thing too is to always
35:09 remember because this brighton video was
35:12 trying to really create
35:14 some hysteria that somehow
35:18 a world war three is in the plans for
35:21 the future
35:23 and i've covered this a couple times and
35:25 this is space related
35:27 conversation here because i'm going to
35:28 be talking about the space way of
35:30 fighting the war
35:31 because it's a super super sad thing
35:34 that
35:35 you know and we've been here before
35:36 remember when we didn't have boats that
35:38 could cross the big oceans we just had
35:40 little
35:41 side skimmers little canoes and tinier
35:44 boats
35:46 well land was the place we fought the
35:49 wars
35:50 and water was sort of a sovereign place
35:53 kind of like a water buffalo running
35:54 away from the hyenas right it just jumps
35:56 on the water now you know they're
35:57 freaked out about water and so it gets
35:59 to just chill
36:00 until the crowd the herd finds it and
36:02 then chases everybody else off
36:04 okay or until they get bored and walk
36:06 off but once we started building
36:08 you know ironsides and battleships and
36:10 stuff
36:12 well we started having war on the water
36:15 it was the new thing
36:19 so what was the safe zone then the sky
36:22 the sky was a safe zone well then we
36:26 started building planes and hot air
36:27 balloons and
36:29 and then we immediately just think about
36:32 it the wright brothers flew technically
36:33 in 1903 did he get the patent until 1907
36:36 because the patent office was trying to
36:38 give the patent to the navy who was
36:40 trying to create a plane they could
36:41 never do it
36:42 so one of the wright brothers went to
36:44 france during the
36:45 the um world fair and he flew it over
36:49 there
36:50 france was like we're gonna patent this
36:52 for france
36:53 in your name and then america use the uh
36:56 the time difference the eight hour time
36:58 difference and patented here before
37:00 sneaky crazy crap think about it
37:03 1907 we have a plane
37:08 and then you get your red baron stuff in
37:10 the latter part of
37:12 world war one by world war ii or
37:14 fighting specifically
37:16 air battles bombing runs over germany
37:18 and
37:19 and the pacific rim war against the
37:20 japanese
37:22 are got the zero and you know it's just
37:24 like i guess it's exciting
37:26 if more morbid
37:29 results are your thing right
37:33 i mean our wars god base or satan based
37:36 you tell me
37:37 you know so now we had conquered
37:42 all perceivable domains and turned them
37:45 all into war zones
37:46 land water and sky
37:49 and now we're going into space why does
37:52 space force get
37:54 created because it's become a liability
37:58 to sneak a bunch of military objectives
38:01 into nasa jpo why do that why have a
38:05 bunch of
38:06 500 toilet seats that then pay for a
38:09 covert satellite
38:10 when you can just finally say look
38:13 everyone else is going into space
38:14 we were one of the first pioneers in
38:16 space after russia conquered all goals
38:18 up there supposedly
38:21 so we gotta we gotta do it we gotta get
38:23 up there to create a deterrent shield
38:26 such that no matter what is launched
38:28 against the united states
38:30 we can knock it out of the sky
38:34 but what's debuted in the last year from
38:36 russia
38:38 the hypersonic missiles
38:41 now again some special effects gurus
38:44 around the world have picked apart the
38:46 launch video of the
38:48 hypersonic missile which was just
38:53 unbelievable uh it the the video of it
38:56 on youtube
38:57 shows a large missile
39:00 utterly and completely disappearing out
39:03 of sight
39:04 so quickly there's no frames for your
39:06 brain to perceive it
39:08 really doing much besides the smoke
39:10 trail
39:11 but cg people went in and realized they
39:13 had been deleting frames
39:15 and basically made it look a lot faster
39:17 than it was now maybe it's super fast
39:20 but you know how many times have we seen
39:25 displays of military capability
39:28 some of you might remember the first
39:30 moab drop i believe in the state of
39:32 florida
39:35 we showed the world what it did and we
39:37 invited
39:38 news agencies to come see it do this
39:41 horrible
39:42 daisy cutter thing in whatever
39:45 wilderness area we dropped that bomb
39:47 i'm pretty sure that's where it was
39:48 dropped
39:51 so if vladimir putin is going to be
39:52 showing off a hypersonic
39:54 missile which is super fast i don't even
39:57 know what speeds they're talking about
39:59 anymore
40:01 you'd invite the independent press the
40:04 associate press
40:05 the reuters maybe even the new york
40:07 times
40:08 popular science people scientific
40:10 american people
40:11 you'd invite the world to see it to be
40:13 freaked out about your prowess
40:16 but when you launch stuff in secret and
40:18 then you submit the video
40:20 eh whatever maybe it exists maybe it
40:22 doesn't
40:26 the idea is that missile would be so
40:28 fast
40:29 that it could get to america before
40:31 america could do anything about it that
40:32 was the big hype
40:34 and the truth of the matter is
40:38 maybe it could get to europe before
40:41 anyone would know about it it could
40:42 definitely get to china before china
40:44 could respond
40:45 but with our technology deployed 1987
40:50 it just will not be able to get to
40:52 america
40:53 it can't if you have as much as five
40:57 seconds of travel it's going to be
41:00 obliterated
41:01 on on its journey
41:05 it will it'll be shredded and it'll fall
41:08 into the pacific ocean and fall into the
41:10 atlantic ocean
41:12 and it's just not going to happen plus
41:14 what if you're china
41:16 you'd have to call uh ggping and go hey
41:18 dude i'm going to be flying a bunch of
41:20 big missiles over your country don't
41:22 worry they're not headed towards you
41:25 but any point in time one of them can
41:26 come right down on beijing on shanghai
41:29 so how do you trust that sort of thing
41:32 right so space is being turned into
41:36 another war zone
41:38 it's gonna be gundam before you know it
41:40 men
41:43 and it's a bummer investing another
41:45 platformer war
41:46 but what can you do man we have a
41:49 country with a billion and a half people
41:51 roughly
41:52 that believes that communism is a way of
41:55 living
41:58 well until that gets sort of sorted out
42:02 i think we have to keep doing this
42:04 unfortunately
42:07 i mean it's one thing to be in europe
42:09 and
42:10 okay so you're you're climbing back into
42:12 tyranny
42:14 uh all right at least we know how to do
42:16 that it'll definitely get to a point
42:18 where it turns into
42:19 what it used to be several hundred years
42:21 ago
42:24 it'll take a while but
42:28 not many people in the first world
42:29 country could
42:31 handle being incarcerated in china and
42:34 having your organs harvested
42:36 so because someone wants to buy them
42:39 and you're a dissident and you're not
42:41 chinese so you're the first person man
42:44 falun gong people go second you're first
42:48 so you know we've got to defend
42:52 ourselves we're going to
42:53 put up a deterrent
42:56 there's the old phrase the war economy
42:58 is a good economy
42:59 yeah whatever you know the problem with
43:02 that
43:02 theory is that so many industries are
43:04 neglected
43:06 you know world war ii you could say war
43:08 economy is a good economy maybe even in
43:10 the 60s with vietnam more
43:13 because what were the products that we
43:14 bought well the most expensive products
43:16 you would buy would be defense products
43:19 it's not to say that they're not the
43:20 most expensive products with the
43:23 the b1 and b2 bombers they're very
43:25 expensive
43:26 the raptors the 33s that are coming up
43:28 here
43:30 all right but we do
43:33 have billions and billions of dollars
43:36 being made with cell phones
43:37 and um computers and a lot of other
43:41 technologies so
43:42 if you were to turn all of the other
43:44 alternate industries off
43:47 because you're fighting some war and
43:48 everyone's turning their pantyhose and
43:50 all their
43:52 you know copper and all this other stuff
43:54 or bullets
43:55 a lot of industries would tank and the
43:57 world would suffer it's not that it's
43:58 not that easy anymore
44:02 but let's review the pipeline real
44:04 quickly for newcomers especially
44:07 about how these mars missions would work
44:11 so what actually technically takes place
44:13 from a human perspective
44:15 independent human beings what do we get
44:18 to see
44:18 as the sort of investors in this
44:22 technology because it's all taxpayer
44:24 dollars
44:25 we see a rocket launch off of a pad
44:30 very impressive we see a camera on that
44:32 rocket for a short period of time
44:35 seems to hug the earth really really
44:36 fast
44:39 then the camera turns off for the entire
44:41 mission to mars
44:42 instead of being on okay so out of sight
44:46 out of mind no stars no milky way
44:49 ever revealed uh most spacex
44:52 footage is of earth you know it's got
44:55 the
44:56 booster in the back no matter what
44:58 rocket they launch it's the same
45:00 engine in the back it's hilarious right
45:03 it's out of sight out of mind at that
45:05 point
45:05 and then what are we doing as human
45:07 beings to tell ourselves that these
45:09 things are actually real we're waiting
45:11 for what images
45:16 the landing sequence doesn't have any
45:18 images i mean they even
45:20 they even did a good job faking the uh
45:22 landing on the
45:23 titan moon of how was it saturn right
45:28 it was that spinning camera showing the
45:31 surface boy they just forget these
45:33 amazing accomplishments they claim
45:35 right
45:38 just makes no sense if you can get
45:40 something to anybody in space
45:42 in our solar system at least then
45:45 you should have a plan to keep the
45:46 camera rolling but that's a liability
45:50 so we're going to have cg art playing on
45:54 our televisions as they are telling us
45:56 that this thing is landing so all
45:58 they're doing if you close your eyes
46:00 and just let the mars mission happen and
46:02 then someone in the room is like okay i
46:04 will tell you to open your eyes when we
46:06 see a real photograph
46:07 supposedly that they've claimed from
46:10 this mission
46:13 well you're going to feel pretty silly
46:15 believing
46:16 all the information coming at your ears
46:18 up until the point they claim to have
46:20 the first shot
46:21 from mars so
46:25 these missions take years to prepare
46:27 right
46:29 they have created and this is the
46:31 ecosystem of the mission
46:34 and this would be quite frankly how you
46:37 would make a massive multiplayer
46:39 online game of the same exact
46:42 information which is the following
46:46 if you're going to say that you're
46:48 landing on mars then you're going to
46:49 need to have a detailed map
46:51 of the surface of mars you have to have
46:53 that first you can't just
46:56 land like the viking stuff is hilarious
46:58 right
47:00 the unbelievably detailed
47:04 you know surface of mars that they have
47:06 generated all
47:07 you know probably out of a bunch of
47:09 different composite photographs of mars
47:11 and again the first pictures of mars
47:12 telescopes a long time ago
47:13 like anything like the mars bc today
47:16 like nothing
47:17 right of course they blame that on bad
47:20 optics
47:21 and sort of like okay those old pictures
47:24 of mars were like stripes all over them
47:26 like looks like they have
47:27 like uh belts around the whole thing
47:30 right is this crazy look like they had
47:32 roads all over mars
47:34 that was the articles uh i believe they
47:36 came out back you know when this these
47:38 pictures were published long long time
47:39 ago
47:43 but you have to have a theoretical map
47:46 of your planet such that when you say
47:49 rover landed here rover landed there
47:51 we're overlander it makes physical sense
47:52 right it's a flat surface so you
47:54 obviously didn't land in the big
47:56 cavern rip they have down the center at
47:59 the equator
48:00 they would just crash right just land
48:03 and start tumbling down the hill it'd be
48:06 a lot of work for nothing
48:08 now with the moon it was a lot easier
48:10 because we can just look at the thing
48:11 with the telescope we can draw
48:13 at a college in a high school and a
48:15 junior high
48:16 in a grade school just as long as dad
48:19 can get you the
48:20 telescope you can just spend a few days
48:23 if
48:23 there was nothing written down right
48:27 give all the little surfaces names and
48:29 so you have to see a tranquility
48:32 cool now mars
48:38 if we were to make it a video game like
48:39 some you know was it uh
48:41 will wright game is the dude that made
48:45 simcity
48:47 okay for any of you've ever played
48:50 dungeons and dragons it's the same exact
48:52 scenario
48:54 if you're a good dungeon master you
48:57 it's like it's like world of warcraft
48:59 quite frankly what happens with world of
49:01 warcraft
49:02 they design a continent this is what you
49:04 do in d
49:05 they pick out all the regions what
49:08 monsters are in those regions
49:10 backstories behind every little cave and
49:13 castle and whatever
49:15 and they know where the mountains are
49:16 where the plains are where the oceans
49:18 are where the waters are where the
49:19 rivers are
49:20 what fish are in the various um
49:24 bodies of water because there's quests
49:25 to cook
49:27 and you got to get certain fish so you
49:29 got to fly around this continent to get
49:31 to that river that has that particular
49:32 fish
49:34 same thing with nasa man you have to
49:37 determine
49:38 the entire surface of mars it's all
49:41 fictitious
49:43 but you do it so that you can have a
49:46 road map
49:46 to land rovers now
49:50 the interesting thing is is again they
49:53 never
49:54 we'll see with this first uh
49:56 perseverance right
49:57 it should be able to do what i talked
49:59 about with
50:00 the other um idea of sending the rovers
50:04 to the moon
50:05 it should you know the moons you should
50:07 drive straight up to all the
50:08 landing sites and take in pictures of
50:11 the terrain that was reused
50:12 several times in different missions
50:14 right they create a new terrain about
50:16 every
50:16 every third mission they create a new
50:18 terrain and then they would use it twice
50:20 and they just rearrange rocks and stuff
50:22 but it's the same mountains in the
50:23 background same perspective
50:25 same distance from the mountains i mean
50:27 if you overlay it in photoshop which
50:29 they never perceived
50:31 happening especially at a consumer level
50:33 then you see the identical nature of
50:35 what they did the fraudulent
50:37 thing they sold you which were the moon
50:39 missions
50:42 but now mars has some pretty amazing
50:47 claims in terms of its terrain right
50:52 it has pyramids pyramid-like structures
50:56 that are
50:56 perhaps natural again sedimentary rock
51:00 is going to fall
51:01 at a very algorithmic fall-off rate but
51:04 it looks like they have flat signs which
51:05 is kind of odd
51:08 but we know we have kind of mountains
51:09 like that and you know on earth
51:11 especially at the end of a plateau it
51:14 typically will split off
51:15 if it doesn't do the veiny thing all the
51:17 way down we've seen some fairly flat
51:19 surfaces but why not
51:20 why not land safely by
51:23 the pyramids whatever the range is of
51:27 perseverance i mean my god what is it
51:29 those first two rovers in the early
51:31 20th century they're still going they're
51:33 only supposed to go 11 months a pop and
51:35 now what are they on
51:36 almost 18 years of functionality which
51:39 makes no sense they require
51:43 solar panels to operate their
51:46 theory of how they were cleaning off the
51:49 solar panels which was pretty cool
51:51 was to vibrate them to shake them
51:55 well now that we have since those two
51:58 rovers were supposedly dropped off on
52:01 mars
52:01 we have solar panel farms nowadays on
52:05 planet earth
52:06 and you need to go look up the videos on
52:08 youtube just type in solar panel farm
52:12 cleaning and look at the
52:15 unbelievable process to clean off these
52:19 these panels and if you listen carefully
52:21 to the dialogue from the people that are
52:23 narrating
52:24 they will tell you the percentage of
52:26 drop off
52:28 of the electrical nature because it's
52:29 blocking sunlight
52:31 that these things will essentially lose
52:33 all of their capability of generating
52:35 the photoelectric effect
52:39 and generating electricity shaking it
52:42 wouldn't work if shaking it would work
52:45 believe me the big
52:46 giant machine that cleans these things
52:48 would not be used
52:49 okay it's got suds and water and
52:52 special careful brushes not to scratch
52:55 the surface i mean it's a very detailed
52:57 process
52:58 but according to nasa you just flap your
53:00 wings and hey it's 100
53:01 again year after year after year after
53:04 year we're almost on two decades man
53:08 so each one of these that never run into
53:11 an anomaly they never get stuck in the
53:13 sand
53:13 i mean what's funny is i live you know
53:15 three and a half miles from the beach
53:17 and you know i've seen
53:20 every vehicle that is supposed to be
53:22 able to traverse
53:24 sand get stuck in the beach like
53:27 10 feet out 20 feet out 100 feet out
53:30 they're vehicles that are made to be in
53:32 the sand and they'll still get stuck
53:33 every once in a while
53:35 you mean to tell me those rovers have
53:37 never gotten stuck
53:39 i've seen them drive you know supposedly
53:42 with the footage we got back when i was
53:43 still a believer
53:45 driving in sand
53:49 plus the other thing too is that there's
53:51 this big delay between the joystick
53:53 supposedly a jpl and the rover getting
53:56 the command in mars
53:58 and then it doing the maneuver and then
54:00 sending back
54:01 the data pictures of where it went
54:06 and the hilarious thing is is
54:09 if you're in sand and lots of you have
54:12 been stuck in mud and sand
54:14 and you're an adult and you've driven
54:16 these vehicles you know
54:17 quite well that as soon as you start
54:19 feeling that
54:21 that lack of traction you know you're
54:23 screwed and you can quickly reverse out
54:25 and get out of that situation hey man we
54:27 can't go that way it's too muddy it's
54:29 too sandy it's whatever
54:32 now again beaches do have water and i
54:34 don't think mars
54:36 simulation has any fluid water in it of
54:39 course
54:40 so you know but again probably at least
54:43 half of the
54:45 beach stranded things that i have
54:47 witnessed personally during the
54:49 surf competitions the extreme sports
54:52 competitions and the paintball
54:53 competitions
54:54 people are getting stuck in dry sand
54:58 and they're right there on top of the
55:00 vehicle and they still get stuck
55:02 so if the rover started having a problem
55:05 they never communicate some ai coding
55:07 that goes
55:08 if it senses it's losing traction it
55:10 backs up it does something different
55:12 there's nothing i haven't thought it
55:14 through yet
55:16 now when i was in high school again this
55:19 is based off probably
55:20 completely crap data okay what i'm
55:23 saying is probably not true
55:26 uh if it is true it's probably a
55:27 coincidence of anything else but my
55:29 teacher
55:30 in uh high school who was an
55:33 uber genius he told us that there were
55:37 you know mountains on the surface of
55:39 mars that are 15 miles high
55:43 okay that'd be kind of cool to look at
55:44 wouldn't it
55:48 okay pyramids big tall mountains
55:51 really cool things i could understand
55:55 uh if all the data was real from the
55:57 reconnaissance satellites that big
55:59 gorge down the center of the
56:03 equator which has been now romanticized
56:05 as a laser beam because somebody saw
56:07 star trek enterprise where they had a
56:09 beam that
56:10 shot um florida
56:13 oh now it's a it's a it's a remnant from
56:16 a space battle
56:18 okay whatever just keep making [ __ ] up
56:22 i mean i don't know man
56:25 it's almost like if i feel like if they
56:28 told us the truth
56:30 this is all fake but are you is it isn't
56:32 it cool
56:34 you get a bunch of the population
56:36 probably more than 51 percent that goes
56:38 yeah we love it man keep going it's just
56:41 nice and entertaining
56:43 and we they have to continue faking it
56:44 you know
56:47 perseverance is a big rover compared to
56:50 the others
56:52 biggest one they've ever sent i don't
56:54 know what's mileage is i don't know what
56:56 its range is but i'm sure it's going to
56:57 operate absolutely perfectly its whole
56:59 life
57:01 health the other two went 17 to 18
57:05 years and they
57:08 understand intimately the rover that
57:11 they designed
57:12 in the early well late 20th century and
57:14 deployed in the early 21st century
57:18 this new one should be unbelievable
57:21 should be
57:21 you know doubled down on everything
57:24 the cameras better be 8k um
57:28 solar panel issue no problem
57:32 getting stuck no problem maybe because
57:34 it's heavier it's going to have an issue
57:36 who knows
57:36 they never make any mistakes do you
57:38 realize that
57:40 because what would a mistake turn into
57:46 would turn into a defunding exercise it
57:48 would turn into an evaluation exercise
57:51 i actually don't think any that would
57:52 happen but it's a potential thing they
57:54 don't want to risk
57:55 they're a perfect organization minus the
57:57 1998
57:59 metric to standard conversion
58:02 story
58:06 but i guarantee you before this rocket
58:09 ever launched off the surface of the
58:10 earth it's just my opinion
58:12 all the photographs that we're gonna get
58:15 for the first several
58:16 months if not years have
58:19 already been generated
58:24 now it could be live where you know
58:26 they're doing that joystick thing and
58:27 again
58:28 you do a joystick and unlike 911 which
58:32 needs to be
58:33 live action stuff right the plane has to
58:36 completely disappear into the building
58:38 which is a physical impossibility
58:41 because
58:42 we can't put debris on the ground and
58:43 they can't calculate you know the the
58:46 all that technology they just can't do
58:47 it maybe they could pre-generate it but
58:50 then you don't have the stuff hitting
58:51 the ground because it doesn't really
58:52 exist
58:52 a big problem but if you've got
58:56 you know a 15-minute delay to to mars
58:59 and then a 15-minute delay back
59:01 and you're dealing with 20-30 minutes of
59:04 rendering time
59:04 with massive super computers
59:08 okay not a big problem
59:12 evergreen is saying accounted for
59:16 we're told that the quantum computers
59:18 aren't stabilized enough
59:20 to really be of any major assistance to
59:22 current day technology
59:24 but what if it is what if it actually is
59:26 stabilized
59:28 what if somewhere in the bowels of nasa
59:30 or the government they've got a hundred
59:32 qubit
59:33 quantum computer fully stabilized zero
59:36 percent
59:38 error or if there is an error it's got a
59:40 decimal
59:42 so far away from the number that doesn't
59:44 matter
59:45 and then you've got enough horsepower
59:48 to generate terrain instantaneously
59:52 like instantaneously men photorealistic
59:55 terra gen 4 which is in a product you
59:58 can download
59:58 on your computer today
60:02 right now while you're watching this
60:03 video if you're on a laptop or a desktop
60:06 you can go download teragen and play
60:08 with it while i'm talking to you
60:10 it's fully accessible
60:13 all right that's above ground technology
60:15 right
60:17 and again i'll just tell the story very
60:18 very quickly for the newcomers
60:22 when i was interviewing some of the guys
60:24 that worked on the movie tron in 1982
60:27 balcony in san diego i asked two of them
60:31 i said well what did you guys work on
60:33 after tron because you know we had last
60:34 starfighter and a bunch of other
60:36 technology maybe uh worked for digital
60:38 domain and helped out cameron
60:39 nope they went to go work for jpl for 13
60:42 years creating
60:43 train simulation software i said well
60:46 how good was it
60:48 i said well depending on how much memory
60:51 you have in the computer every grain of
60:52 sand man no problem
60:55 well they worked there during the first
60:57 rover 93 the little tiny one that
60:59 just drove around really quickly and
61:00 then ended
61:03 not that they needed that software to uh
61:05 generate the fake pictures we saw
61:09 i mean they're real pictures it's just
61:11 not mars
61:14 now the question i i seldom touch on
61:17 which i want to touch on for this
61:18 episode is are they really creating
61:20 any usable technology for
61:24 if this would ever become possible
61:28 and i'd say oh yeah for sure absolutely
61:32 you can't keep everybody
61:35 in the dark and you don't disclose this
61:37 and the other thing too is that you know
61:40 there's a big perception that everyone's
61:42 in on it and that's absolutely not the
61:44 case
61:46 there's plenty of people who probably
61:47 are but you know overall amount of
61:50 employees i mean who knows i don't know
61:51 how much uh
61:52 gpl nasa employ i'm sure it's over a
61:56 hundred thousand employees
61:57 you're talking about almost every single
61:59 person being convinced this is real
62:01 really building the rovers really
62:03 building the rockets and the satellites
62:05 and enclosures and all that good stuff
62:07 writing the software testing stuff out
62:09 theoretically
62:11 it makes sense on paper if you believe
62:14 all of the
62:14 physics of what they're saying
62:18 and again what if it what if it turns
62:21 out
62:22 that the truth of the matter is we can't
62:25 land on the moon until we come up with
62:27 an ethereal
62:28 anti-matter or no it doesn't have to be
62:30 anti-matter but an ethereal
62:32 anti-gravity engine
62:35 that talks to the universe instead of
62:38 talking to atmospheres
62:40 okay it talks to the atmosphere of
62:43 the fabric of space and it can just go
62:46 up there and land like ufo
62:48 just boom until we get that technology
62:50 because there's no atmosphere on the
62:52 moon there's just no way
62:54 to land anything on on the moon without
62:56 crashing really hard you'd have to do
62:58 the balloon technique
63:00 then again if you're going anywhere from
63:02 17 30
63:03 000 miles an hour i don't know what can
63:06 survive
63:07 that situation
63:11 what if it hit a rock a big big
63:14 rock sticking out of the ground 20 30
63:16 feet at that speed you know would just
63:18 be
63:18 pate but because
63:22 mars might have a certain might have a
63:24 atmosphere
63:25 like earth we actually can land stuff
63:28 on mars because we have a technique of
63:30 using our current conventional
63:33 engines that we use here on earth which
63:36 provide the lift for everything you've
63:37 ever seen take off from
63:40 from a launch pad
63:43 now there is one dude out there
63:48 that we all have sort of this
63:52 question about because if i said to you
63:56 name the guy that runs nasa some of you
63:59 might know the president of nasa
64:01 if i said name the guy could be a girl
64:04 too i guess
64:06 i don't even know who runs gpl
64:10 you probably don't know i don't know but
64:13 who's the space guy
64:14 on planet earth right now the de facto
64:17 space guy
64:19 it's elon musk well elon musk smoked a
64:23 joint on joe rogan's show
64:26 bill clinton played a saxophone in our
64:27 studio hall
64:30 neil degrasse tyson was in
64:34 zoolander 2 and the big bang
64:40 bill nye the douchebag guy well where
64:42 has he not infected society with his
64:45 capitulation they make heroes out of
64:49 people so that you just believe
64:50 everything that they say
64:51 and we have had heroes like carl sagan
64:55 or may or may not have been correct
64:56 about what he said but
64:58 you don't get the sense his goal was out
65:00 there trying to disinfo the world he
65:02 probably just read books really
65:03 efficiently and made
65:04 great videos where he might have been
65:07 wrong
65:08 but he was pitching the current theories
65:10 of the day
65:13 but the big question is we're almost a
65:16 hundred percent
65:17 okay certain that
65:20 a lot of what spacex does is equal bs
65:23 besides low orbit things
65:28 we know they're lying about some things
65:30 because we see launches from california
65:33 going over the pacific ocean towards
65:35 china
65:36 telling us that it's going to resupply
65:39 the space station in space which is
65:41 going the other direction
65:43 there's no methodology to turn around a
65:45 rocket that i'm aware of
65:47 and go supersonic the other direction
65:50 those are most likely spy satellites or
65:52 something completely different
65:54 or just something for show
65:58 the spacex launches are nauseating
66:02 hollywood television production it's
66:05 it's
66:05 in fact even television is better today
66:07 than hollywood in a lot of cases but it
66:08 would be almost like
66:10 80s television where it's lower budgets
66:13 and
66:15 less convincing you know if you were to
66:17 watch buck rogers in the late
66:20 70s along with battlestar galactica
66:24 yeah no you knew it was fake you know
66:26 when you watched star wars in 78 80 and
66:29 83
66:30 well you got some massive you know
66:33 richard edlin
66:34 level effects going on
66:37 so you could maybe convince yourself
66:39 that stuff's real right
66:41 at least they weathered the ships in
66:42 some cases right
66:46 our big question is does this guy know
66:50 that everything's fake and i think the
66:53 answer is yes
66:54 he makes a lot of uh jokes about cg
66:58 but what is sort of spacex's entire
67:01 portfolio of things that might be real
67:03 it might be fake
67:05 right well he put a rover
67:08 a roadster excuse me keep saying the
67:10 wrong thing i said it wrong in my uh
67:13 space xyz
67:16 pdq thing or whatever um
67:20 the roadster the first tesla roadster he
67:23 put one in the falcon 9 and supposedly
67:25 launched it into
67:26 orbit or i guess he threw it into space
67:30 is sort of the idea you have tires that
67:33 didn't explode you had
67:34 plastic that didn't melt or freeze
67:37 didn't have any twerking of temperature
67:40 which
67:40 it's a tumultuous environment up there
67:42 right any of you've
67:44 seen your dashboard split as a result of
67:46 heat and
67:47 fatigue you're talking about anything in
67:50 the light was
67:51 about 250 fahrenheit probably a little
67:53 higher and anything in the shadow was
67:55 250 below
67:57 fahrenheit so you're talking about just
67:58 ripping this car to shreds a second that
68:00 the canopy opens
68:03 nope no problem tires didn't explode
68:06 i mean it just would have been a would
68:08 have been really cool had they just let
68:10 the car
68:10 explode in space it would have been
68:12 really cool wow that really is in space
68:15 but no they repurposed the iss
68:20 technique of making a space station look
68:22 like it's in space as they're creating
68:24 fake footage
68:26 and just most of the world swallowed it
68:30 i know a lot of people in special
68:31 effects that don't even think twice
68:32 about it
68:33 but it's funny to have a bunch of
68:35 friends in special effects to believe
68:36 everything nasa says
68:38 and that a bunch of them on their own
68:40 they're not coming to me
68:41 to break their seal they're finding out
68:44 on their own
68:45 with just looking at the data and
68:47 they're coming back proving to me
68:49 that this stuff is fake in some cases
68:52 where effects are really easy to see
68:56 a lot of north korean rocket launches
68:58 for instance were just atrocious
69:01 junior level cg
69:04 i mean hats off to that guy for uh
69:07 trying we know that i can't remember
69:11 whether or not it was north korea or
69:12 china but i believe
69:15 well i know one of them actually used
69:18 footage from top gun
69:20 the movie from the mid 80s and
69:22 broadcasted to their people and said
69:23 this is our air force
69:25 kicking ass and taking names it's a
69:26 bunch of american planes with american
69:28 insignias
69:29 and white dudes flying the plane and
69:32 they're trying to tell their asian
69:34 population that that's our dudes it's
69:36 like doesn't make any sense and
69:38 top gun is like one of the most popular
69:40 movies from the 80s it's like you might
69:42 want to borrow from like a bomb movie
69:44 that at least had
69:45 decent you know fighter pilot scenes you
69:48 know
69:50 but what's a spacex launch well they put
69:52 all these hipsters in a room and they're
69:54 just
69:54 they have like an applause scream sign
69:56 you know
70:00 and they just butter the whole thing up
70:02 don't they
70:04 heavily orchestrated scripts always that
70:08 uh because you know so let's keep going
70:11 the platform
70:12 excuse me we got the roadster in space
70:14 that didn't explode
70:16 totally fake we've got his rockets that
70:18 launch and supposedly the
70:20 boosters come back down and land on a
70:23 pad
70:25 but to my knowledge well i don't know a
70:28 single soul that's a real human being
70:29 that's ever seen that actually occur
70:31 with their own eyes
70:32 again if it's the most phenomenal thing
70:34 that's ever existed you would be taking
70:36 tons of shots of this thing
70:38 with thousands of people watching i
70:41 watch the space shuttle
70:42 take off with hundreds of thousands of
70:45 people
70:47 in 1983 with sally ride's maiden voyage
70:50 it was 83 and then i watched a space
70:52 shuttle land in the
70:54 california desert with 850 000
70:57 people in the desert so i've seen it
71:00 take off and i've seen it land
71:02 okay i can say that thing goes into
71:04 space and the thing
71:06 lands and it comes in at mock which is
71:09 busting the sound barrier like crazy as
71:12 it comes in
71:14 all right so why can't i get a ticket to
71:16 go see these boosters land and film it
71:18 with my iphone
71:19 live stream it right onto youtube or
71:21 facebook or whatever
71:24 probably because it doesn't really
71:25 happen and of course they've now pushed
71:27 it on a
71:30 a ship in the middle of the atlantic
71:33 ocean right
71:34 but the theory is is that okay it's
71:36 already going that direction while we
71:37 just pick it up in the ocean
71:40 yeah the amount of mathematics that
71:42 would need to occur
71:43 is insane and every single time the
71:45 things about delay on the camera cuts
71:48 because they're switching to a different
71:50 feed or they're laying it down with a
71:52 crane or whatever
71:53 fake crap they're doing so it's
71:56 insulting our intelligence
72:00 and again it's funny because a lot of
72:03 you
72:03 chimed in when i mentioned this and i
72:05 have to thank each and every one of you
72:10 it appears that some of you are at least
72:13 very informed about structural
72:15 engineering
72:16 because what i was talking about is when
72:19 one of these rockets launches
72:21 okay and again they're picking up
72:22 welders off the street they're picking
72:24 people off the street
72:25 that have never welded in their life and
72:26 teaching them welding because i know one
72:29 and they become welders for spacex so
72:31 we're not talking about the best welders
72:32 in the world
72:34 at least in part when these fuselages
72:38 get
72:39 launched the amount of metric tons of
72:41 pressure
72:42 from the engine compartment up is insane
72:46 micro fractures in the steel would deem
72:48 these things
72:49 completely useless completely useless
72:53 and they're not the most expensive part
72:55 of the journey
72:57 what do you think is more expensive the
72:59 rocket or the rover
73:01 and taking care of the rover once it
73:02 lands the expense is all in the back end
73:05 not the front end who cares
73:09 okay so it's a casualty of the budget
73:12 the
73:12 the fuselage or whatever the hell you
73:14 call the
73:15 rocket body itself it falls into the
73:18 ocean
73:19 right i'm not [ __ ] any tears i've
73:21 never i've never
73:23 heard anyone say because they did this
73:25 with the space shuttle right those
73:26 boosters come off and then
73:28 fall in the ocean they can go grab them
73:29 out
73:31 i've never heard anyone say well i i
73:33 just i i would pay for this space
73:35 program but i
73:36 i don't want to be paying for rockets
73:37 every single time these things better be
73:39 reusable
73:40 said no one ever right
73:44 and i think right before nasa uh within
73:47 a couple years of
73:49 spacex supposedly landing something
73:51 backwards
73:52 nasa had just failed again you know like
73:56 40 years of trying they just could not
73:58 get this
73:59 any rocket to go up and then land back
74:01 down comfortably
74:03 and spacex is like well cg we never make
74:06 a mistake
74:09 now again to get anyone to go along with
74:12 this whole thing there's some
74:14 basic ecosystems and offerings that
74:17 could get someone to do it
74:20 with an average employee at a high level
74:23 of clearance in nasa it is
74:25 probably straight up the paycheck
74:29 second thing would be you're going to be
74:32 revered for something isn't happening
74:33 but who cares
74:35 you have a choice of not being revered
74:37 because nothing's happening or being
74:39 revered for something that they think is
74:40 happening
74:42 which one do you want right
74:45 how many people over the years of rock
74:48 and roll music especially
74:51 have just wanted the fame of being a
74:53 rock star but don't really want to have
74:55 to write music every single year
74:57 they don't really want to have to tour
75:00 because it's a grueling process they
75:02 just want the fame they just want to
75:03 walk into some place and all of a sudden
75:05 the tables get clear the meals free the
75:07 chicks jump on you whatever
75:08 guys jump on you whatever you want
75:11 a bunch of these kids a bunch of these
75:13 kids just want the fame
75:15 and so maybe there's some guys in nasa
75:18 and you know what
75:19 they could probably pre-qualify
75:22 individuals
75:24 see if they will go for it get them into
75:27 some other deceptive things to see if
75:28 they're willing to go for you a slimy
75:30 bastard
75:31 ah he is he's totally what level of
75:33 slimy bastard he's like an eight and a
75:35 half
75:35 i think we can get him to a nine or ten
75:37 as soon as we get him involved because
75:39 he's gonna eat this up
75:40 okay great poof
75:45 we reveal the astronauts like like gods
75:48 sometimes right
75:50 some groups do and we've had some pretty
75:53 mortal people
75:54 uh some pretty questionable ethics and
75:57 judgment what was the woman in florida
76:00 that uh
76:01 her boyfriend was one of the astronauts
76:04 that went up
76:05 while he was up in low orbit supposedly
76:09 must have been she went to a bar to go
76:11 and kill
76:13 or beat up severely i think it was to
76:15 kill a woman in the
76:16 bar that was supposedly sleeping with
76:19 that guy
76:20 behind their back and so she was going
76:21 to level the playing field while he was
76:23 in space
76:25 yeah that's some really good judgment
76:26 there and good ethics right
76:29 so when you talk about whether or not
76:30 astronauts will go along with it
76:33 they're human you know
76:36 how many people do we see in this world
76:38 right now
76:41 that are trying to use the crises that
76:43 we have today to
76:45 seem superior but they just showed up to
76:46 the conversation like five minutes ago
76:49 about what's really going on the world
76:51 who's who who's in charge what's going
76:52 on i have no idea
76:54 about the dark crop that's going on
76:59 but they're experts all of a sudden
77:00 research nothing know everything
77:02 well there's plenty of those people that
77:04 will gladly
77:06 pretend to be astronauts
77:10 and they're not stupid in fact they
77:12 might actually be the complete
77:14 antithesis of stupid how many brilliant
77:16 people
77:17 are responsible for wars is henry
77:20 kissinger stupid
77:22 no is dick cheney stupid donald rumsfeld
77:27 zigner brzezinski were they stupid hell
77:30 no
77:31 quite the opposite which is why they get
77:32 hired do the job man
77:37 now i want to come away from
77:40 the outer space stuff and get back to
77:42 the satellites for one second
77:46 there is a the video i saw in brighton
77:49 mentioned sort of an attack sequence
77:52 that i guess is on the table now with
77:55 technology
77:56 that is disclosed which is a neutron
78:00 bomb
78:00 and an emp bomb the neutron bomb
78:05 i guess has been tested and detonated at
78:08 some point
78:10 such that they believe that the big
78:11 countries have it including china
78:14 most likely due to intellectual theft
78:17 but the idea is that it kills all living
78:20 matter and leaves everything else behind
78:22 so you just pop it over a major city
78:24 and within a few months everyone's dead
78:26 of of something if not immediately
78:29 depending on the radius proximity it
78:32 would be an airburst situation you
78:33 wouldn't want to break
78:35 everything down below and then all these
78:38 people are dead
78:38 and then supposedly the theory is that
78:40 they can invade that particular area so
78:42 they're
78:43 supposedly able to come completely
78:45 across the
78:46 pacific ocean undetected with just
78:49 legions of soldiers okay
78:53 and then this missile comes in poof and
78:55 then ah all the people are dead now you
78:57 just you take
78:58 los angeles right
79:01 i hope that your just instant instincts
79:05 dismiss the likelihood of that ever
79:07 being possible
79:10 maybe if the entire world attacked the
79:13 united states that's possible
79:15 but you'd have to have russia in on it
79:17 and russia knows they would be the next
79:19 target
79:19 so i don't think they're ever going to
79:20 go along with that
79:22 no matter how many back door handshakes
79:25 and promises to the contrary
79:28 they'd be next okay
79:31 the other one is the emp and the emp
79:34 doesn't need to be a ballistic missile
79:38 but the electromagnetic pulse bomb
79:40 obviously
79:41 puts out a massive massive frequency
79:45 that would vibrate all pieces of metal
79:48 that were small
79:50 such that they would thermalize vaporize
79:55 that means that everything's making this
79:58 show occur right now would disappear
80:00 would turn into fire the bulbs that are
80:04 lighting me
80:05 go out and they would be
80:08 destroyed forever you would have to
80:11 manufacture
80:12 brand new components to get anything to
80:14 turn back on again
80:17 but the threat on brighton was again
80:19 sort of like one of these coast-to-coast
80:21 am
80:21 interviews where they're putting
80:23 together absolutely implausible
80:26 scenarios to freak you out
80:30 because that creates views and that's
80:33 how the breakdown platform works by the
80:34 way
80:35 there's there's freedom of speech as
80:37 long as you can be popular
80:40 with your initial truths right it's so
80:42 stupid
80:45 but there's a much easier way to pull
80:47 off an emp
80:48 situation in los angeles and probably
80:51 any city in the united states of america
80:54 and that is the shipping docks
80:58 now a lot of you know this already and
81:01 some of you never heard this before
81:02 so maybe this is interesting to you if
81:05 any of you have seen any of the videos
81:08 where you have
81:09 this unbelievable inconceivable amount
81:13 of shipping containers that come over
81:14 from these
81:16 these uh boats i used to know a guy who
81:20 unloaded them from the cranes in
81:23 long beach used to smoke cigars down the
81:24 street with me
81:27 they don't check even the majority of
81:30 these containers to see if they have
81:33 something volatile in them people
81:36 children
81:37 women uh because you could put a whole
81:41 camp in there right you could put uh
81:44 food in there and everything in there a
81:45 little apartment complex in there they
81:47 could definitely survive the journey
81:51 they could have drugs it could have all
81:53 kinds of stuff so they only spot check
81:55 these containers
81:56 and it's a tiny fraction of the amount
81:58 that are allowed into the country
82:02 now we do i don't know if they use these
82:04 at the ports but i know that the
82:06 canadian border
82:07 has sensors for atomic
82:12 half-life emissions and it's so
82:16 unbelievably accurate that a woman
82:19 who was on chemotherapy drove through on
82:22 this
82:22 television show they have about border
82:24 control and she set off the alarms
82:27 and then i believe it was because she
82:28 had chemo in her system and it was just
82:30 setting off the alarms the emission from
82:32 the chemo
82:33 i should tell you how wonderful
82:35 chemotherapy is
82:39 so a nuclear payload well that would
82:41 have to be massively
82:42 massively shielded and i mean
82:47 the amount of shielding that it would
82:48 require would probably
82:50 bust the cap of the overall allowed
82:53 weight
82:53 of that particular container thus that
82:55 the cranes couldn't hang on to it you
82:57 couldn't lift it up and you couldn't put
82:59 it on a flatbed truck without
83:01 having the extra wide payload you know
83:04 dually tires everywhere right
83:09 but an emp device
83:12 i don't believe would have to have
83:14 anything that would
83:15 immediately show up on any one of these
83:17 scans now i'm hoping
83:19 the customs and security have
83:22 a lot of secret techniques for vetting
83:25 these containers that are not publicized
83:27 such that every container does get
83:29 vetted
83:30 for specifics of which i'm talking about
83:32 but if you think about an emp
83:34 system which is not something that we're
83:37 able to
83:37 see with our own eyes you know there was
83:39 a fictional one inside of um
83:41 the movie matrix it's been several
83:43 movies but they never really show you
83:44 what it is and if they do it's just some
83:46 cg thing right
83:47 no basis on reality
83:51 but you would imagine it would be some
83:54 electronic
83:55 device that is going to be able to
83:57 generate a tremendous amount of
83:58 electricity
84:00 and then disperse it
84:03 so maybe you have one container
84:06 with a gigantic one you take it to a
84:09 special facility to charge it up
84:11 and you got so many minutes to get it
84:13 down the street
84:15 you just drive it down wilshire
84:17 boulevard
84:19 uh the 101 that goes right through los
84:22 angeles downtown
84:23 and you pop it and a bunch of stuff gets
84:28 fried
84:30 if you're able to get one in the country
84:31 then you might not rely on
84:35 there being just one if you're going to
84:38 be
84:39 china and i as much as i'm not a big fan
84:42 of the ccp i don't want to accuse
84:44 them of things they're not doing this is
84:45 just a scenario
84:49 maybe bring in 10 on 10 different ships
84:53 you put like you know
84:57 some some you know uh
85:00 brand on the outside that has been going
85:02 into the docks for years and so the
85:04 inspectors just skip it because it's
85:06 like now that's just cigarettes or
85:08 whatever it's
85:09 little rubber toys or whatever
85:13 so you had your bed you drive them all
85:15 over los angeles which is a very big
85:18 place it's a it's not like most cities
85:20 that are really condensed
85:21 i mean there's it's a lot of miles man
85:23 it's about 35 miles square
85:26 so even if it's preferred to drop it
85:28 from space
85:30 you could do a lot of damage imagine one
85:32 in the center of new york one in the
85:33 center of
85:34 san francisco they all have you know
85:37 cargo
85:38 shipping close by it didn't matter if
85:41 you can get it in
85:42 in georgia you just drive the thing
85:45 straight up as long as you didn't get
85:46 caught
85:47 you just got a portable bomb on your
85:49 hands right
85:51 think about how much damage one of those
85:54 could do
85:55 and say new york city
85:59 in new york city alone how what would be
86:01 the budget
86:02 of all of the electronics destroyed in a
86:05 split second
86:06 was say manhattan or something trillion
86:09 dollars
86:11 how much damage could it do every
86:14 single electronic device
86:17 besides maybe some big tube radio
86:19 somewhere here and there
86:22 it hasn't been retrofitted with new
86:24 components as a repair
86:26 just gone in a split second how many
86:29 years would it take to repair a city
86:33 from something like that how many years
86:38 a decade before it is even nominally
86:42 functional again
86:43 how many years did it take to build new
86:44 york city
86:46 all that's gonna have to be repaired
86:50 is something i don't think that the
86:52 controls of the world
86:53 really dig as much as we think they do
86:56 they create
86:56 problem reaction solutions everywhere
86:58 but it's always a very confined space
87:01 right less damage is possible with the
87:03 most
87:04 changes possible the whole
87:08 virus thing we have in 2020 is really a
87:10 freebie
87:11 right people call people to free people
87:14 out oh this
87:15 is invisible boogie man's in town you
87:16 know it's a real thing
87:19 but to the degree it's been
87:22 sensationalized
87:23 it's not that big but it stopped the
87:26 world
87:28 phone call stopped the world
87:31 let's take all those other theaters of
87:33 war besides space
87:35 now let's think this thing through for a
87:37 split second
87:39 could you have a conventional army
87:41 rolling across your country
87:43 soil and you not know about it until
87:46 last second
87:48 now probably can't too many people's
87:51 cell phones
87:53 to just make that phone call hey look at
87:54 this being in there just videotaping
87:56 there's a whole army of russians
87:58 going through kansas right you'd know
88:02 okay can anyone cross the oceans without
88:05 us knowing with the big
88:06 invading force absolutely not their
88:09 24-hour satellite
88:11 24-hour radar 24-hour naval fleets it's
88:14 impossible
88:15 to not know could someone bring
88:18 something to the sky
88:20 and you not know about it no way
88:23 air traffic control would pick it up you
88:25 realize every single plane that's in the
88:27 sky
88:28 is sending out radar signals to figure
88:31 out what it's next to
88:32 so it can tell the pilots and then
88:34 that's all related to the ground
88:36 outside of ground-based radar it's
88:38 impossible
88:39 unless somehow you could jam everything
88:40 but then you'd have this big
88:42 void coming at you right you would know
88:45 that's that's probably full of a big
88:46 formidable force
88:48 it takes a long time to fly from china
88:50 to the united states with people
88:52 and that's flying at 550 miles
88:56 an hour still takes you you know 14
88:57 hours to get to hong kong
88:59 right okay
89:03 now let's go to space
89:06 could a bunch of satellites be moved
89:08 into place
89:10 and punch the earth and let's not know
89:13 about it
89:13 because that's the fear
89:17 i would say
89:20 there's two sides to this answer and my
89:23 estimations of technology that i've been
89:24 privy to know about and stuff i've
89:26 researched myself
89:28 the answer be no and yes
89:32 know that we wouldn't be able to see it
89:35 coming at us
89:36 and again with all that arsenal up there
89:38 i told you about
89:39 it's 33 years old and i'm sure it's
89:43 gotten a lot better since then and i
89:44 think that we would be protected in a
89:46 first world capacity
89:49 but if any of you you've ever seen
89:53 you know death by a thousand needles
89:54 theories
89:57 you know that there could be potentially
90:01 an onslaught of things that you know if
90:03 any of you played a video game where you
90:05 just get absolutely overwhelmed by
90:06 enemies
90:08 sometimes they could rush in so quick
90:09 you're getting most of them but all you
90:10 need is a couple to land
90:12 and you got a big problem on your hands
90:15 what was the big missile shield
90:16 issue in israel and then it was uh
90:20 redone on the border of russia
90:24 which was that we were putting in a
90:26 missile defense system that was three
90:27 layers deep
90:29 meaning as rockets were coming over from
90:32 russia
90:33 we had three different techniques to
90:35 knock it out the sky and black vladimir
90:37 putin did an actual press conference on
90:38 this
90:39 saying that um they were aware of this
90:43 technology being put on his border i
90:45 think it was in the ukraine
90:48 and he was uh very close to debuting new
90:52 technology they could punch through that
90:54 and that has since come and passed and
90:56 he claims to have that technology and i
90:58 guarantee you it's just a matter of
91:00 overwhelming the system
91:02 what i'm trying to tell you is the gist
91:04 is
91:07 those numbers aren't very good for any
91:09 attacking force and i
91:10 i would think unless you were the worst
91:14 statistician you wouldn't
91:17 use strategy of that kind it's too
91:22 it's too likely to expose your hand
91:27 it's too likely to make you lose and
91:29 thus deem yourself
91:31 the enemy of the state of the world and
91:34 that you're being very aggressive and
91:35 you're starting a world war potentially
91:37 and then everyone will get freaked out
91:40 demand that their armies be used against
91:42 you
91:43 and so you know even though china's
91:47 definitely favorably viewed by europe
91:49 because europe's trying to use china's
91:50 money to bail themselves out of their eu
91:52 bankruptcy
91:54 they still would crush china because
91:56 they don't want that
91:57 they know once you spread one place uh
92:00 you're gonna spread other places and
92:01 they just don't want that kind of
92:02 instability in the world
92:03 so no one can really win that war it's
92:05 the old war games theory
92:08 so i think we're okay now i've heard
92:11 conspiracy
92:12 theories as i finish up here
92:15 and this is really like a double-decker
92:19 cake of conspiracy
92:23 which is that the elite of the world
92:25 want to leave
92:26 earth and so all the mars missions are
92:30 based on
92:32 figuring out how to make that possible
92:34 for them
92:36 i seem to remember uh elon musk saying
92:39 at least
92:41 a few times that he was going to be on
92:43 mars personally
92:45 and that he would willingly die on mars
92:48 to be one of the first explorers over
92:50 there in 2018
92:51 okay so again what's interesting about
92:56 every product that elon musk puts out he
92:58 really knows how to
93:00 play up the hype game because the hype
93:02 game is a very interesting game
93:05 it would be um
93:08 well the way it works is that you say a
93:10 bunch of hype things that everybody
93:12 thinks is the coolest thing on planet
93:14 earth and because he does deliver
93:16 good products you know he's sort of the
93:17 version
93:19 of electric cars he's done some
93:22 incredible battery development even
93:24 though his latest battery factory
93:26 is now obsolete for a new design i don't
93:29 i haven't heard any updates on that
93:30 whether he's got a better patent in
93:32 there
93:34 he's a progressive dude we kind of like
93:36 his attitude
93:37 i don't i don't say i haven't seen him
93:40 say or do anything
93:41 that makes me dislike the guy whatsoever
93:45 but he knows that no one ever holds
93:47 anyone accountable for this stuff
93:50 for those of you who frequented the old
93:52 magazine omni
93:54 way back in the 80s
93:57 especially they ran contests
94:00 to orbit the moon they ran contests
94:03 on landing on the moon
94:06 and none of that ever occurred the
94:09 russians have sold tickets to
94:11 orbit the moon none of those missions
94:13 have ever happened
94:14 but that's like 20 year old claims some
94:17 of them 35 year old claims
94:19 never happens and no one ever seems to
94:22 remember
94:24 it's almost as if you you bought some
94:28 organ enlargements pill off the internet
94:31 and then you took it and nothing
94:32 happened and you feel so utterly
94:34 embarrassed that you fell for the scam
94:37 that you don't want anyone to know you
94:39 parted with the money
94:41 think about the prospect of conquering a
94:43 brand new planet
94:46 for those of you remember the original
94:48 total recall from 1988
94:50 i think it was somewhere in there
94:54 you know they ran a scenario in that
94:56 movie of
94:57 having turned mars into a mining colony
95:01 run by this one guy who was the dude
95:03 from uh
95:05 um robocop
95:08 incredible actor who plays the best bad
95:11 guys on planet earth
95:15 they had turned it into a slave
95:17 community right it was uh
95:19 the earlier the earliest settlers that
95:21 happened way before the movie
95:23 took place had mutated due to
95:26 bad shielding from the sun and so they
95:29 had all kinds of wild psychic powers and
95:31 that kind of stuff
95:36 but erase that particular sci-fi element
95:38 to the story
95:40 well if you flew to mars to be an
95:43 endangered servant to some mining colony
95:45 or some construction company
95:47 or something then you are now in the
95:49 wild wild west
95:50 and there's a lot of x minus one
95:52 episodes about this very thing
95:56 you're not protected anymore anything
95:59 can happen there
95:59 who are you going to call they're
96:01 totally and utterly in control
96:04 well agenda 21 is all about resetting
96:06 the earth
96:07 to establish 100 control back into the
96:11 hands of those who perceive themselves
96:14 as the rulers of the world
96:17 sadly we have seen in 2020
96:20 they have a tremendous amount of
96:23 supporters
96:24 in the freest country on planet on the
96:26 planet right
96:28 it's really sad how gullible and
96:30 ignorant people are
96:32 and i wanted to pass this into this
96:34 episode i could probably do a whole
96:36 episode about this
96:37 but maybe this is a preview
96:42 imagine that you wanted to pull a scam
96:46 on society
96:48 pick whatever scam you want but what the
96:50 scam requires is a bunch of uninformed
96:53 citizens of the planet to go along with
96:55 your scam
96:56 to force those who are informed to
96:57 comply because they're simply being
96:59 overwhelmed
97:00 by complicity
97:04 you have an educational system which
97:07 records all of the iqs of the people
97:10 graduating from k-12 you definitely have
97:13 a list of all the degrees that have been
97:15 awarded
97:16 and all the major universities you can
97:19 even track someone's life
97:21 we don't have this capability but they
97:22 have this capability of trying to track
97:25 okay this person graduated high school
97:27 with this particular gpa
97:29 then they went to college and they got
97:31 this particular gpa even though they
97:32 passed
97:34 let's look at their overall salary and
97:36 success
97:38 you could even track asset purchasing
97:40 and everything mobility do they go on
97:42 vacations
97:43 we can find out just how dumb
97:46 a particular region of the world is and
97:48 the more sophisticated and first world
97:50 country it is the better
97:51 and easier it is to track that
97:53 information
97:56 all right so they do the algorithm
98:00 in a computer perhaps a big machine
98:03 learning computer
98:04 perhaps a quantum computer and they find
98:06 out
98:07 that once the average iq
98:11 syncs to a particular overall
98:15 bell curve even though they're smart
98:18 people at the higher levels there's not
98:19 that many
98:21 and they realize that the simulation is
98:23 now
98:24 coming back with the data that they want
98:27 they get complicity
98:29 they maybe do some little uh focus
98:31 groups
98:33 what if this happened what would you do
98:35 what if someone told you to wear a mask
98:38 would you do it oh yeah sure absolutely
98:42 okay what's interesting about what we're
98:46 dealing with
98:46 at this particular year is that the
98:48 amount of
98:49 microbiology you need to understand in
98:52 order to understand whether or not
98:54 you're in harm's way
98:56 is quite a bit for the average person
99:00 when you factor in pre-existing
99:02 conditions with a particular
99:04 virus it compounds even further
99:08 to understand whether or not you're at
99:10 risk
99:12 as the data gets muddied up because
99:14 everyone being checked into a hospital
99:16 is marked a covered patient through an
99:17 icu
99:19 well now you're going to have a bunch of
99:20 data that's being folded into the system
99:23 that is incorrect cause and effect
99:26 models that actually
99:27 aren't related to each other but
99:30 if we don't clean out the medical
99:32 industry from all this bad data that was
99:34 acquired during this
99:36 scam then
99:40 which is an over exaggerated version of
99:42 reality right reality does have deaths
99:45 and
99:45 this virus does cause deaths don't get
99:47 me wrong
99:49 but saying a kid who broke his arm in
99:51 orange county
99:52 right now okay you break your arm and
99:55 you go into an icu
99:57 intensive care unit they mark you down
100:00 as a covet patient
100:01 this is straight from people who do it
100:04 okay to me
100:05 not through somebody else but to me
100:06 personally
100:08 they mark it down as a covid patient the
100:10 policy is is that that
100:12 that check box on your diagnosis
100:16 can be altered after 36 hours
100:20 so let's think about this your kid was
100:23 messing around broke their arm as a
100:26 parent
100:27 if it's your first child to break an arm
100:30 whether you have
100:31 multiple children or not you're freaked
100:33 out man you go to the icu
100:35 they straighten your kid's arm they set
100:36 the bone they put a cast on it
100:39 all this paperwork's being filed in the
100:41 background all you want is your child to
100:42 be repaired
100:43 to stop crying to start letting everyone
100:47 sort of deal with the kubler-ross phases
100:49 of your kid being injured
100:51 you want to be home with that child
100:54 watching tv
100:55 giving some ice cream whatever it is to
100:57 calm the whole situation down
101:00 are you going to go back a day and a
101:01 half later
101:03 to say oh you know that check box you
101:04 checked i want to uncheck that
101:07 no so these hospitals are fraudulently
101:10 marking people as covid patients so they
101:13 can steal the money
101:14 from the government hopefully there's an
101:16 investigation in that at some point
101:19 where someone looks at the the diagnosis
101:22 and goes okay
101:23 for every dime that you steal from the
101:25 government we're going to charge you ten
101:26 dollars
101:28 so think it through but all these cases
101:30 that have already gone through
101:32 or it was not classified properly
101:35 we're just going to ding your hospital
101:36 to the point where probably the hospital
101:38 goes bankrupt and has to switch owners
101:41 to be opened again and then that
101:43 hospital is going to have a stigma for
101:45 the rest of its life as being a
101:46 fraudulent organization
101:48 all the hospital administrators will be
101:50 fired any of the nurses and doctors will
101:52 be prosecuted for falsifying medical
101:54 data
101:55 may be kicked out of the industry for
101:56 the rest of their lives
101:59 with perhaps the opportunity for
102:00 individual testimonies
102:02 for people to say well my boss who's the
102:04 doctor made me do this the hospital
102:06 administrator made me do this
102:07 but again if i told you to go rob a bank
102:09 and you did
102:11 am i gonna get prosecuted only if i'm
102:13 charles manson
102:15 the rest of it is you just being dumb
102:17 and following bad advice i could say i
102:19 was joking
102:22 part of the reason to mention that is to
102:23 underline and underscore
102:25 the fabric of society that would feed
102:28 all these space programs
102:30 the feeds the believability of the space
102:32 programs and feeds those who
102:34 perpetrate the deception to us
102:39 that's why i know a lot of you are
102:42 working
102:43 overtime with your friends and family
102:46 that's the best group to work through
102:48 social media is not the best
102:49 best to work through
102:53 you don't have much credibility with
102:54 people you've never met face to face
102:57 potentially have a tremendous amount of
102:58 credibility with your family members
103:00 especially if you've kept a good record
103:02 and you're not a boy who calls a wolf
103:03 and you had a person who's got a
103:04 criminal background
103:07 which is why disinformation is very
103:08 dangerous because if you present this
103:10 information as true fact and it comes
103:12 out that you were
103:14 posting something incorrectly then
103:17 you'll
103:17 whittle down anyone's ability to listen
103:19 to you which is a bummer because if you
103:22 tend to get the information right at
103:24 some future point
103:25 and you're you know 99 pieces of
103:28 information out of 100 is correct
103:30 you may not have anyone to listen to you
103:33 unless you're very
103:34 very strategic with the way that you
103:35 communicate with your family go look i'm
103:37 really sorry
103:38 you know i didn't have my pipeline down
103:40 to evaluate information but let me show
103:42 you this
103:43 i'm going to show you where i looked up
103:44 things and made sure things were right
103:46 or wrong
103:49 the reason why all of this space
103:53 deception can continue forever
103:57 it's because we're not fixing society at
103:59 its base form
104:01 isn't it interesting that we at least
104:03 have a tremendous amount of people
104:05 questioning the medical data that we're
104:06 getting in 2020
104:08 but almost no one questioning space data
104:12 because people want to believe
104:15 and part of that you know you can
104:18 understand 100 percent you can
104:19 sympathize with people's desires to
104:21 believe things
104:24 but if it results in a
104:27 reaction solution that is going to end
104:29 up removing
104:31 freedom and sovereignty the same thing
104:35 then we failed
104:39 as i said a long time ago in the first
104:42 year of the show
104:44 and those hardcore listeners have heard
104:46 this a hundred times i apologize
104:48 for repetition but for the newcomers
104:50 this show is aimed at giving you
104:52 personal power at every level from
104:56 being creative again first seasons on a
104:58 different channel
104:59 because they were all remastered so
105:00 definitely go to deepthoughtsradio.com
105:02 click on the season one channel
105:06 but it's it's to help you with
105:07 everything from those deep
105:09 psychological issues that you're gonna
105:12 deal with
105:13 by yourself when no one else is around
105:16 which is the first sort of
105:19 empowerment that needs to occur in my
105:21 opinion you know we're trying to
105:24 well put this way if you were a
105:25 structure okay
105:27 what this show is trying to do is add
105:29 more beams in there
105:30 where you need them to make you stronger
105:32 to make you more resilient to
105:35 to give you a clear path at things that
105:37 you thought perhaps
105:38 impossible because no one ever told you
105:41 that it's not special people who do
105:43 things it's people who do things
105:45 and guess what you're a person so you
105:47 can do anything that you're capable of
105:49 doing
105:50 now if you're five foot one woman you
105:53 probably can't walk out
105:54 on a nfl playground or a playground
105:58 in a field and play professional
105:59 football but there's something that you
106:01 can do at 5-1
106:03 as a female that those guys out there on
106:05 the field can't do
106:07 so we're equal in different ways right
106:11 i don't like seeing people get
106:15 deep into their lives with a regretful
106:18 view of their past
106:20 the past is the past man you can never
106:22 change it
106:23 right a lot of the politics going on
106:25 right now especially
106:27 in that movement with the letter q in it
106:31 is a lot of trying to go backwards and
106:34 fix the past
106:35 there's a lot of that that needs to
106:37 occur on a legislation level
106:40 but it only it could be perceived as a
106:42 value if it fixes the now
106:45 and then thus preserves the future
106:48 at the corrected version of now that we
106:51 have right
106:54 it's interesting how in my entire life
106:58 okay i've been obsessed with space
107:02 travel since i knew that any space
107:04 travel had occurred
107:05 i mean i thought it you know i used to
107:07 stare at the viking pictures and the
107:09 moon pictures
107:10 and the space shuttle shuttle cut away
107:13 illustration on my wall that a lot of
107:15 you had probably if you're around my age
107:16 50 years old
107:18 but what's fascinating about it is that
107:21 an average conversation
107:23 my entire life unless i'm talking to a
107:27 bunch of geeky guys like me
107:29 no one even mentions uh without
107:32 disasters okay to push it into the
107:35 consciousness of man but they don't
107:36 really mention
107:37 space shuttle missions when they were
107:39 occurring no one really talks about the
107:41 iss
107:42 even being there no one ever talks about
107:44 the mars missions
107:46 it's like a little article here and
107:47 there but no one ever pays attention
107:50 but when you start totaling up the
107:51 budgets
107:53 of these programs you're talking about
107:55 tens of
107:57 hundreds of billions of dollars
108:00 i hope that as a result of any
108:04 type of program whatsoever that the
108:06 technology we're inventing is going to
108:07 good use but
108:09 by the time it gets propagated up
108:12 if there's any true creation within
108:15 those institutions because i always
108:17 envision black
108:18 ops stuff being where the
108:21 state-of-the-art stuff happens that
108:22 we're not allowed to know about until
108:24 it's you know in our toaster later on
108:26 right
108:28 but this is a an area of great interest
108:31 for the listeners of deep thoughts radio
108:33 which i love
108:35 but you tell me you tell me have you in
108:38 your lifetime
108:39 been in a mall food court and you just
108:42 hear the conversation next
108:44 next you going oh my gosh you're the new
108:46 rover's on mars and pablo did you see
108:48 this did you see it
108:49 you know maybe with the internet's a
108:50 little bit more active but
108:52 i just don't hear that i just don't
108:56 what i hear is what we're talking about
108:58 on this show which is do you think we
108:59 really did that you know i mean it's
109:01 always a question of whether or not it's
109:02 real
109:04 but i will tell you other than freshly
109:07 graduated aerospace
109:09 kids okay who've been sold a
109:12 big bill of goods right the adults
109:16 who have had a chance to really think
109:18 things through
109:20 they just shake their heads and they go
109:21 you know i can't believe the scams going
109:23 on and
109:24 no one seems to realize it
109:28 but so here's your uh other episode
109:30 question which is
109:33 what area of space
109:37 programs
109:40 have i missed that i need to talk about
109:44 it could be a very specific area
109:48 uh one thing on my list that i have not
109:49 done a video on yet because i think it's
109:52 going to be a bore fest
109:54 is the uh internal computer
109:57 rope memory related of the lunar lander
110:02 and how they created it and you know it
110:04 was like this
110:05 if you guys have not seen the videos on
110:07 rope memory and you know
110:09 the anatomy of a computer fairly well
110:12 it's a mind-blowing
110:13 concept that they created that
110:17 functionally does work i mean i've seen
110:18 people use these devices
110:21 today um i don't believe it validates
110:24 anything about the new missions
110:25 whatsoever
110:26 but it's an interesting way to i feel
110:29 like there's going to be some
110:30 achilles heels inside the rope memory
110:32 argument if you guys happen to know
110:35 a really good way to get into that i've
110:38 seen the videos
110:39 with arthur c clarke and a few nasa
110:41 people back in the 60s creating this
110:42 even black and white movies
110:44 of them stitching this rope memory
110:47 together
110:50 i think there's more to it but let me
110:52 know let me know if there's an
110:53 area that we're just simply not covering
110:55 that needs to be covered because i love
110:57 the subject matter
110:59 and for those of you who always want me
111:01 to do a new nasa video
111:03 i need you to understand that i sit
111:05 around the house and
111:06 whatever in my beach community here
111:09 and i angst a little bit because i also
111:12 love the subject matter but i am
111:14 so against
111:17 cannibalizing my own material from
111:19 previous episodes
111:21 just to satiate you guys because i feel
111:23 like that's a low quality
111:24 product that i don't typically put in
111:28 the show
111:30 and i just don't want to take it there
111:32 you know
111:33 so anyway i hope you dug the episode
111:36 for those of you who have not been to
111:38 deepthoughtsradio.com that's where we
111:39 get everything
111:40 the video the podcasts the social media
111:43 links again we do have
111:45 quite frankly the best group of facebook
111:48 people
111:49 i think in any page
111:52 on the internet and that's it's funny i
111:54 make that claim a lot
111:56 and um like we've been getting some new
111:58 subscribers so hopefully
111:59 you new folks are having a good time i
112:02 did have a person try to do that
112:04 um that old saying of i'm leaving your
112:07 group because you have too many people
112:09 that believe things i don't believe and
112:11 it's sort of that way of trying to make
112:13 me change you know what we
112:15 talk about so this person feels
112:17 comfortable i apologize for you feeling
112:19 uncomfortable
112:20 but what i have experienced as of the
112:23 last
112:24 month is that i've gotten some really
112:26 close friends of mine that i've known
112:28 for years
112:29 to go up and join the page and i'm now
112:32 getting
112:34 comments routine text messages and
112:36 face-to-face comments like yeah the
112:38 people on your
112:39 facebook page they're just really cool
112:41 people i really enjoyed i learned more
112:43 off your facebook page than any other
112:46 artery that i'm subscribed to so just so
112:48 you know
112:49 that's a super high quality place to be
112:51 i do do a little bit of twittering
112:53 and mines.com is my other favorite spot
112:56 which is sort of a sovereign
112:59 uh free speech area that's very much
113:00 like facebook i think it's pretty
113:02 beautiful site
113:03 i do gab and parlor but those two are
113:05 just uh
113:07 no fun uh right now i mean parlor such a
113:10 pain about to log
113:11 in you have to do all this verification
113:13 every single time you go to your account
113:14 it's like
113:15 please free you know i don't need a jail
113:18 cell in front of freedom of speech right
113:21 so like i said the new
113:24 season one is on a new channel there's a
113:26 couple ways to donate to the page
113:28 we have patreon for those who know about
113:30 that i don't really engage in the
113:32 um tiering of it
113:36 because i just want you all to be on the
113:38 same level
113:40 what happens is if you do donate
113:41 anything on patreon ever or even through
113:43 paypal with a handle
113:46 because you can do paypal anonymously
113:47 you can do it with your your handle
113:49 you do get in the credits forever even
113:52 if you have to pull out
113:53 for several months or forever you're
113:55 still in the credits
113:56 i think you guys can realize those who
113:58 are still active have a bigger font
114:00 if you do cross a 25 barrier i'm gonna
114:04 put a
114:05 special color on your name so we do have
114:08 one person contributing at 50 bucks
114:10 which is super awesome
114:12 but again during these hard times don't
114:14 worry about it
114:15 if you spare a buck what you typically
114:17 get is the episode the second it drops
114:20 and when the season is typically rolling
114:23 uh you're gonna get
114:24 uh episodes a couple days before
114:28 someone else because i have a hundred
114:29 episodes i have to create within one
114:30 year
114:31 i am still working on the season six
114:33 intro it's gonna be
114:35 probably a month away from august first
114:38 here
114:38 before that's going to release so i'll
114:40 keep you entertained in the meantime at
114:42 least one a week
114:43 but if i could think of the episode i
114:46 immediately create it i don't hold back
114:49 again tesla episode is coming to finish
114:51 up this season here so um
114:53 i'll probably get that done this coming
114:55 week i finally finally got
114:56 through some critical patents
115:00 and so anyway there's a store too by the
115:03 way take care of yourself and someone
115:05 else and i'll see you in the next deep
115:06 thoughts
115:07 over now
115:24 [Applause]
115:30 uh
115:41 [Music]
115:48 you
