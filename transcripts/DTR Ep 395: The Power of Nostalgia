00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:34 deep thoughts on this windy California
00:39 day it's about 70 degrees good to see
00:43 the Sun out because I punch this Hurst
00:47 le Toro my brand new punch god the thing
00:51 is so nice so today I thought I would
00:54 cover a subject that I actually meant to
00:57 cover last season and it completely
00:59 slipped my mind I hadn't started my
01:01 wound or list for the show and that is
01:07 something to the effect of I'm not sure
01:09 exactly how spend the title but it's
01:13 about nostalgia the power of it and you
01:18 know whether or not there's any value in
01:19 it or you know we're sort of conditioned
01:23 as we get older to feel stupid about
01:26 having any nostalgia but what is a
01:29 nostalgia I mean really it's it's not as
01:33 as easy as the definitions that are
01:36 thrown around the 400 goddamn shows know
01:40 how to fly touch me you know it's like
01:41 this dudes like hey what's up flyer in
01:44 your head maybe I'm dead and I don't
01:49 know it oh but nostalgia
01:52 let's just break it down at least into
01:57 two distinct areas there's probably more
02:00 because it doesn't take long before you
02:02 start building it up right the first
02:05 phase of nostalgia is just having a
02:08 memory of something past and it could be
02:16 a thing it could be a person it could be
02:19 an institution it could be an entire
02:21 culture like it used to be this way
02:25 I mean you hear me lament about my own
02:26 this nostalgia on episode after episode
02:30 right but then you have this sort of
02:37 yearning this sort of no country for old
02:41 men theory of wanting to get back to
02:45 your nostalgia back to what you used to
02:49 value or what you value today that you
02:51 used to have and so it develops a weird
02:57 interpretation of the current days
02:59 because we yearn for things that will
03:04 never be the way they used to be even if
03:06 we're able to recreate them to the best
03:08 of our ability and everyone's on board
03:10 it just won't be exactly the way it was
03:13 because you intentionally recreated it
03:15 as opposed to the serendipitous
03:19 accidental organic method of what you
03:22 first encountered it in some cases
03:25 obviously the world is an infinite place
03:30 you could have were castrated in the
03:32 past they can orchestrate it again but
03:33 there's I just find that you know I
03:38 coined this thing with myself in a
03:40 previous episode here which is just
03:42 trying to put all the chaos back in the
03:43 Box the Society has dragged out and yo
03:50 are you obviously known I obviously know
03:51 you can never do it it's like all that
03:54 packing you get from companies every
03:56 once in a while they'll pack some parts
03:58 and some cords and cables and and you
04:03 you need to pack it back up because
04:06 you're selling it to a buddy and you
04:09 just can't get the [ __ ] back in the box
04:11 no matter what you do and you're like
04:12 how the hell these people do it that's
04:15 sort of today if you want to go
04:17 backwards I did my episode on needful
04:21 things you know the constant lusting of
04:24 man for material objects or or things
04:29 that are nostalgic that remind them of
04:31 the past and it's just a huge powerful
04:36 wake because I think that the more that
04:39 we do that and the more that we're
04:42 incapable of actually fulfilling that
04:44 nostalgia then we feel bad we have like
04:48 this failure algorithm inside of
04:50 ourselves that we
04:51 dislike the current day times we can't
04:54 roll with the punches we really want to
04:56 just teleport back to our childhood and
04:59 living it again and of course we always
05:03 overlook everything that was sort of
05:05 difficult when we were kids because the
05:07 brain simply won't hang on to anything
05:09 that's negative
05:10 it just won't if it has an alternative
05:14 now I've got friends that hang on a
05:16 negative like you wouldn't believe but I
05:19 think for me the the algorithm that
05:23 repeats itself in my own brain
05:24 year-to-year has to do with the
05:29 difficulty of just being alive and that
05:33 I can remember my parents living in a
05:36 much simpler time I'm gonna have to go
05:39 do scarecrow duty here
05:41 I'm sure you'll go off here in a couple
05:43 more seconds when I hear about the way
05:47 my grandparents grew up it was a little
05:49 harder they had the depression their
05:52 jobs were more physical labor so you had
05:54 like my grandfather on one side the
05:57 families work in a farm the other dude
05:59 is he owned the dry cleaners at one
06:03 point he was a city clerk at one point
06:05 my grandma one of my grandmothers was a
06:07 full-time teacher the other one was a
06:09 stay-at-home mom but whatever they
06:12 committed to it paid the bills that was
06:15 the nice thing and the their jobs lasted
06:22 forever if they wanted to do it forever
06:24 like my grandfather could have been a
06:25 farmer on his own wind for a long time
06:28 he ran oil wells on his land after that
06:33 my parents you know they lived through
06:37 that sort of just just I was pretty
06:41 funny I did my scarecrow routine and he
06:45 went into alarm mode and all these are
06:47 the crows showed up to back him up was
06:50 pretty pretty funny all right back to
06:54 the subject here it's a goddamn Crozier
06:57 [ __ ] up my routine here so when I look
07:01 backwards I can definitely see the
07:02 society was
07:04 much more reliable much easier again you
07:07 got a job and you can keep it for the
07:09 rest of your life and retire in my
07:12 little hometown you would be an
07:13 accountant - chiropractor a janitor a
07:16 teacher whatever a car salesman and you
07:19 simply could stay that your whole life
07:23 we had a guy that used to work the
07:26 Texaco station just half a mile from my
07:29 house he's always the Texaco station guy
07:32 you didn't own the place but you would
07:36 pull in you knew his name he cleaned
07:38 your windshield
07:39 take care of your car fill you up and
07:41 you just love the guy he's just that guy
07:44 and if he ever needed anything because
07:47 he has a long history helping you out
07:49 you're there for him no matter what he
07:51 needs and that's how it used to be
07:55 nagging New York LA Chicago Dallas all
08:01 these different big cities I wasn't here
08:03 when as a kid so I don't know it sure
08:07 seemed like it was a lot more reliable
08:10 nostalgia spreads over every metric of
08:13 human consciousness right it is how well
08:18 things were made how things were made
08:20 maybe you liked a particular style of
08:22 something better we look at music today
08:26 and the kids today I mean you got the
08:29 Z's coming up ripping guitars apart and
08:32 drums and and we're gonna be I think
08:35 we're gonna be doing really well in
08:36 about 10 years less than 10 years but
08:39 you're Millennials couldn't figure out
08:41 music to say their soul and X wasn't
08:43 exactly that much better the baby
08:47 boomers dominated music I mean amazing
08:52 accomplishments right so why bring this
08:56 up is it just to lament about this
08:58 interesting emotion yeah some of it is
09:01 but what's sort of interesting about it
09:03 is that here we are in the middle of a
09:07 society that isn't worth continuing the
09:10 way that we've been running the game the
09:14 whatever's whatever generation has
09:16 [ __ ] completely
09:19 whatever generation is you know
09:21 responsible for generations responsible
09:24 for messing the entire world up it's all
09:27 been done so now we can see it it's not
09:30 as bad as it could be it could be worse
09:31 but it's pretty bad right now you know
09:34 art is almost non-existent in this world
09:37 and it used to be that you could go down
09:39 to Rodeo Drive going to an art gallery
09:41 and see if the finest art from Russia
09:43 from Europe from America and now you go
09:47 in and it's just rehashed
09:49 old stuff they're just trying to sell
09:51 old things or the new things or just a
09:53 joke and they're you know there are some
09:56 artists out there that are just utterly
09:57 phenomenal but they're rare super rare
10:01 now used to bathe in this stuff when I
10:04 first got here in 87 who's this who's
10:07 that who's this and a lot of these
10:08 people were unknown artists somewhere in
10:11 the world that were just pounding out
10:12 the most amazing things so here's where
10:17 nostalgia comes in potentially as a tool
10:20 to determine where we want to go from
10:22 this point forward and how we want to do
10:24 it and sort of not just exactly what we
10:27 want to tangibly have in our hands but
10:29 the sort of archetype of how we want
10:32 society to work now isn't it cool when
10:36 you have you're gonna learn a new skill
10:40 you want to learn how to paint like like
10:43 fine painting and so if you just
10:46 randomly go to class and they give you a
10:48 bowl of fruit and a wine bottle and some
10:50 cut cheese or a naked person it's okay
10:53 you know
10:54 you got to learn how to do that too but
10:56 if that doesn't interest you then you're
11:00 gonna be screwed when it comes to really
11:03 having a passion for something that you
11:04 would have a passion for as long as it
11:07 was different and something you were
11:09 interested in so you pick a photograph
11:10 of a loved one perhaps someone who's
11:13 past or someone who's alive and you want
11:14 to just honor them while they're you
11:16 know what you have a chance and you
11:18 paint it or you get a car photographs of
11:21 wild chrome you know it's got some you
11:24 know beautiful reflections off of it
11:26 you're like I need to learn how to paint
11:28 this and so you just start you know your
11:31 crappy if
11:31 first you paint little tiny paintings
11:33 first and then you get the bigger ones
11:34 as you get better every time I learn how
11:37 to program a language I always pick a
11:39 project that's been on my list for years
11:41 and I start programming it and it
11:43 becomes a tool the people can use so
11:48 nostalgia could be something that we use
11:52 as a tool to figure out how do we change
11:56 this planet what is our goal
11:59 you know when we talk about replacing
12:02 our money supply and the digital
12:04 currencies currencies you know that I
12:05 talk about deflating the overall amount
12:10 of money such that someone could go out
12:13 and eat dinner and go to a movie for 25
12:17 cents to people I know that sounds
12:20 absurd but it shouldn't it's just math
12:21 just dividing the ridiculous $50 tab
12:24 down to 25 cents and the cool thing is
12:27 money laundering in a society that's
12:29 been deflated in its currency is almost
12:32 impossible how could you you drop a
12:35 penny it's a big deal someone steals a
12:38 penny from you it's a big deal so you
12:40 instantaneously catch money laundering
12:42 all these companies that want to charge
12:45 you an extra you know you know 9/11 tax
12:48 like [ __ ] you dude that shit's long
12:51 goddamn gone you don't get any extra tax
12:54 because I had a traumatic situation that
12:56 was imposed on me a long time ago so we
12:59 have to set standards to figure out when
13:01 we're done with our revolution when
13:03 we're done evolving to the next kind of
13:06 Oasis where we can then work to maintain
13:10 it because that's just gonna be just
13:11 like a relationship good country is like
13:15 a good relationship you got to work on
13:16 it every single day and every day you
13:18 wake up sometimes you as I was told by
13:21 one of the most powerful couples I ever
13:22 met you choose to love the other person
13:25 you know you choose to love your country
13:27 you choose to love a system that perhaps
13:30 isn't the best for absolutely everybody
13:33 but overall it's the best thing that you
13:35 know will serve a huge Society of 350
13:39 million people or more to quote an
13:42 American number look at I mean we'll
13:45 just
13:45 through a few of them's to kind of shake
13:47 your mind a little bit to say okay think
13:49 about the agendas of the world which are
13:52 obviously much more real peace solving
13:57 world hunger all that good stuff but
14:00 let's just look at some fine-tune things
14:03 that make us excited to be alive of
14:08 course not warring it's one of the most
14:11 exciting things on it most exciting
14:13 states that the world could ever be in
14:15 and there's no pending war there's no
14:18 building up tensions between two and
14:19 outfits but look at the cars of the 40s
14:26 50s and 60s in the United States of
14:28 America hell even the 70s I mean every
14:31 decades got their awesome cars trust me
14:33 I mean geez what happened in the 70s and
14:36 80s was awesome in the nineties not so
14:38 much you know there are some amazing
14:40 brands out there that create amazing
14:41 cars but most the brands have gone
14:44 totally boring as [ __ ] all the big four
14:48 here in America big three plus some of
14:50 the other stragglers even the Tesla
14:52 models are just boring looking SUVs the
14:54 best thing that Tesla has ever done in
14:56 terms of being sexy but once you see the
14:59 doors go up a few times you're kind of
15:00 done with it but you look at a 58
15:04 Plymouth Fury 57 Chevy 65 Volvo bill GTO
15:10 the what the mock Mustangs the old
15:14 Firebirds the dual intake early 70s
15:18 Firebirds the old Trans Am that smoking
15:21 the Bandit used to drive those 59 or 49
15:26 to 49 mercury yeah
15:29 49 Mercury's and the way that the these
15:32 people were I live customized these
15:35 things and slam them and smooth them out
15:37 and rebuild them just honor them isn't
15:42 it funny that these car retrofit shows
15:44 where you know the wife calls up those
15:45 folks and say hey you know I got a car
15:47 for you to redo and I think the show and
15:51 then people share the expense and then
15:53 they take it off and fix it up it's
15:56 never like you know 95 total Coral
15:59 they don't want to fix that kind of [ __ ]
16:01 up because it's boring look at the
16:03 remake of the Malibu what a joke
16:06 then remake of the Challenger what a
16:08 joke
16:09 these these things used to be muscle
16:11 cars used to kick ass and take names now
16:13 they're coming back right Mustangs are
16:15 looking pretty cool nowadays except the
16:17 back windows so small no one none of my
16:18 friends want to own it and yes we were
16:22 fuel inefficient and all this other
16:24 stuff but come on we can fix all that we
16:26 can make these things electric cars if
16:28 we want to at least they can be sexy the
16:32 other thing is I look at the clothing
16:33 revolutions per decade and it's
16:35 phenomenal
16:36 you know everything up to 1950 was
16:39 pretty basic suits and dresses it's good
16:43 people look good baseball games dressed
16:45 up I thought that was awesome but in the
16:47 60s had this incredible explosion of
16:50 longer hair and these wild kind of
16:53 minimalistic dresses that these girls
16:54 aware and then we came up with all the
16:55 crazy dances you know the twist and the
16:58 potato and all those other things right
17:02 the mashed potato then we got
17:06 bell-bottoms in the 70s we got sequences
17:08 and all kinds of wild stuff look at
17:10 Earth Wind & Fire back in the day
17:12 Parliament's kiss I mean you had just a
17:17 society could dress sort of like you
17:19 know Led Zeppelin it was sort of like
17:20 you just get some polyester shirts
17:22 try not to gain too much weight society
17:25 as a whole was actually much healthier
17:27 and we ate butter and we ate eggs we had
17:31 all these things that are supposedly bad
17:33 for us because they were all organic we
17:37 didn't just OD on candy constantly the
17:43 eighties gets silly well some of the
17:45 bands right but everybody was happy and
17:49 everybody was kind to each other and
17:51 then again there's that dark era that
17:53 we've been in ever since the globalists
17:55 really started taking over American
17:56 culture
17:56 now we're bathing in all these satanic
17:59 [ __ ] bands so it's hard to describe
18:05 to a young person today the euphoria it
18:09 was to wake up in these eras it was
18:12 exciting to go
18:13 it was exciting to go to a party it was
18:15 exciting to watch a movie because
18:17 society wasn't so dark you know we
18:20 didn't have all this terrorist crap
18:22 trying to keep everybody on edge
18:24 it's beautiful more of a monarch
18:26 butterfly I flew by anything is is we
18:30 just had Vietnam we had the Korean War
18:35 we had the nuclear scare we had this
18:36 Cold War thing so if you wanted to focus
18:38 off on all that negative stuff I suppose
18:41 you could but it wasn't until we had
18:44 like CNN Headline News in the 80s that
18:46 we could sit there and OD on propaganda
18:49 and demise of this and that and why
18:53 there has to be a war here to war there
18:54 and you know when some of you remember
18:59 or at least my age when Desert Storm was
19:03 being covered on television we were we
19:07 were drunk on on you know missile
19:10 cameras remember that one that was the
19:13 general I forgot that big guys name
19:15 looks like Captain on Gilligan's Island
19:17 but it came that they really put a
19:20 missile supposedly inside of a I can
19:24 air-conditioned or drain or like some
19:26 vent on top of a hill and a muesli dream
19:29 but like a pipe and then it blows up in
19:31 the center of the building and it was
19:32 like man we put a smart bomb right down
19:34 this hole and then poof the whole
19:36 building explodes and we're like yeah
19:39 Bor that man maybe there's a bunch of
19:43 people in there yeah yeah I'm sure
19:45 there's a bunch of dumb bad guys in
19:47 there who have been riled up the nest
19:50 has been kicked around quite a bit
19:52 they're just trying to fight for their
19:54 land yeah we might disagree about damn
19:57 near everything about how to live life
19:58 and how to treat women and all that
19:59 stuff but they're not they weren't
20:04 headed for my doorstep at the time
20:06 though we started pissing everybody off
20:10 you know I didn't grow up in the 30s and
20:13 40s but I tell you what man when I go
20:15 back and look at the music and the
20:18 entertainment the films that were made
20:20 back in those days you know you listen
20:23 to that sort of 1940s war muse
20:26 you know mr. Sandman and company was
20:29 that the bugle boys a company B you hear
20:31 those kind of songs you hear Glenn
20:32 Miller you hear sing sing sing I didn't
20:36 grow up with that era but I tell you
20:38 what man it I have a total de Stael
20:41 Jaques force to live in that era you
20:44 look at Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin
20:49 before they got all angry at each other
20:52 it's an amazing year the Rat Pack
20:55 amazing era I wasn't even alive still
20:59 amazing but here's what I find sort of
21:03 interesting and it's sort of an overlay
21:07 on society today I often talk to you
21:10 guys about resurrector resurrection
21:13 after death and the fact that when we do
21:16 resurrect we obviously are not keeping
21:18 the majority of our memories from a
21:20 previous life and so we get to believe
21:23 in magic again
21:24 Santa Claus Easter Bunny tooth fairy all
21:27 these things school is sort of this wild
21:31 symbolic thing you know it's like when
21:34 you're young and you're looking at a
21:35 fictional book of a dinosaur that hangs
21:37 out with the kid named Danny or Freaky
21:40 Friday or all these other things or
21:43 shoes are stuck into the wall and stuff
21:44 on that particular day somebody has
21:46 three legs
21:47 it's real inside your mind it's like
21:50 where do I find this world that's what
21:54 it was when I was a kid and then I grew
21:57 up and all the magic disappears and then
21:59 sort of the cynicism of living with
22:02 individuals that are still that are now
22:04 struggling with life and isn't that sort
22:10 of what's going on in well you know I
22:12 can't speak for other countries but in
22:14 America and you could I would love to
22:15 hear love to hear okay if you live in
22:18 Europe or other places Australia
22:20 anywhere else in the world and you're
22:22 hearing this nostalgia thing please tell
22:25 me the archetype of your country in sort
22:29 of where you think it was great if you
22:31 still think it's great and you know
22:33 where you think you're headed sort of
22:34 thing because for me you take the 20th
22:37 century which is the 1900s
22:40 and you go back to I mean you know we
22:46 were kind of broke in this country
22:47 around Charlie Chaplin's days but again
22:50 you could do an honest day's work and
22:52 father went to go work mom stayed at
22:55 home and you had all the amenities of
22:56 life and so I feel like that was sort of
23:01 our infancy as a country we got rid of
23:04 this tumultuous 1800's where we were
23:06 building a railroad and coming up with
23:08 where towns were gonna be and we're
23:11 living in literally in log cabins where
23:14 winters were brutal summers were brutal
23:16 and you still had to work still had to
23:20 plow a crop you know you still had to do
23:22 whatever the hell you had to do cut down
23:23 trees hunt food every single day so we
23:25 got rid of that whole first formidable
23:28 tin or so say by ten decades right so
23:34 for me I feel like the 19th century for
23:36 America was sort of our adolescence are
23:38 our childhood but we had you know a
23:42 bunch of really stoic staunch adults for
23:47 pretty much I'd Satan you know back to
23:51 1776 all the way up to the 50s they had
23:54 this morality locked in with the church
23:56 as soon as you got older you weren't
23:58 supposed to show your emotions effect
24:01 that was one of the big dysfunctional
24:02 things that Mister Rogers tried to
24:05 circumvent was the children were
24:07 becoming sort of mentally abused because
24:10 the parents weren't awake and in the 60s
24:14 we sort of started waking up and then he
24:16 took that baton and ran with it right
24:19 but now as like I get older and world
24:24 gets more cynical just around me you
24:26 know we're noticing all these cabal's
24:28 that destroy the society bankers and
24:31 monarchs and politicians or sellouts and
24:34 military guys or sell its intelligence
24:35 officers or so it's CEO's that are
24:37 sellouts you know it occurred to me of
24:41 the day that if you have guys haven't
24:43 seen it if you want to see a great
24:46 example of corporate globalism and sell
24:49 out go look up the Nestle
24:52 CEO talking about the fact that he
24:54 doesn't think that human beings have the
24:56 right to clean water Wow right
25:03 we now have political correctness off
25:05 the chain so no one can even communicate
25:07 without some scumbag sitting on the side
25:10 going you said that word in the wrong
25:12 tense the wrong and you can't say that
25:15 anymore
25:15 here's what's the new word well we're
25:17 we're still trying to figure out the new
25:18 word but it's got a five year you know
25:20 sentence on it so in you know six years
25:23 that word will be bad word I feel like
25:27 once we hit the 90s it's sort of
25:30 wherever our normal human being hits
25:32 their level of oak Ahad life is getting
25:33 hard you know I got three kids and they
25:36 all got to go to college I only got
25:37 money for one to go to college and what
25:39 do I do
25:39 I don't want to screw my kids you know
25:44 down the line the best thing about the
25:47 21st century is the internet and this
25:50 Great Awakening and everyone kind of
25:51 going yeah you know what my grandfather
25:54 used to tell me these guys were bad and
25:56 then my dad started telling me these
25:57 people were bad now I'm finding out that
25:59 they're bad and now we're finding out
26:02 that even while we were celebrating
26:04 previous eras of our country our country
26:07 was being taken over you know it what I
26:12 find a little confusing especially for
26:15 the two or three listeners that always
26:16 report in from the UK and some of you
26:19 reported from Australia we have in my
26:25 opinion you know the European bloodline
26:28 has been there for an extremely long
26:29 time at least 2,000 years that are
26:33 pretty well documented so for me you
26:37 don't get tyranny you don't get
26:39 monarchies you don't get globalism and
26:41 socialism and fascism easily if
26:45 everybody has already been through it
26:48 once and it's ceremoniously failed
26:51 unanimously failed every single time it
26:53 comes about second your country takes
26:55 away your guns here comes all the store
26:58 Konya law that takes away all of your
27:00 rights it's just it just happens it's
27:02 just a one-two punch that they do
27:05 and I'm not sure if it's just the
27:08 Prussian education system where people
27:11 are so nationalistic in a in a bad way
27:14 that they're willing to just do anything
27:16 that their leaders say I can't
27:19 understand it I don't know how Europe
27:21 appears in my eyes to be beat down to
27:23 the point where they just look the other
27:25 way as all this chaos and craziness
27:27 happens and what's nuts is you know I
27:31 started this show 2015 we started the
27:35 previous show in 2014 early like March
27:38 2014 and none of this weird
27:40 transformation of Europe had started and
27:42 then we watched it occur during I think
27:45 this show and it's it's just
27:49 mind-blowing
27:51 in America you know one of the things
27:55 that Europeans say when they come over
27:56 here is man every building you have is
27:58 brand new your highways are brand new
28:01 everything's brand new and if we leave
28:03 for 10 years and come back half the
28:06 buildings that we saw last time we were
28:07 here have been torn down and rebuilt
28:08 it's just what you guys do and they're
28:12 right so for me when you go to when I go
28:18 to Europe I you know when I was in
28:20 England several times I'm looking at
28:23 buildings and I remember asking these
28:24 people well how old are those buildings
28:25 right there and one person estimated one
28:29 row was like 400 years old and one row
28:31 was like 800 years old and I'm going 800
28:35 years old what are you talking about I
28:36 said that 1200 BC ad what are you
28:39 talking about well yeah you know I think
28:41 that came and you know this time and
28:43 they may been wrong but I think the 400
28:45 year one was definitely true because it
28:48 just looked ancient but people are still
28:49 renting the place and living in it's
28:51 been totally retrofitted totally cool so
28:53 maybe only a partial amount of its
28:55 veneers the only thing that's left the
28:56 insides been completely rebuilt but they
28:59 did an amazing job at these places I was
29:01 I was observing so it dawned on me that
29:04 you know wow yeah you know I mean
29:06 obviously Germany where I was born my
29:09 family lived for a while you know have
29:11 whole albums of that stuff as a kid and
29:14 that stuff's ancient ancient stuff right
29:16 so for me
29:20 the ability to maintain a contact with
29:22 nostalgia in Europe and in England and
29:25 Scotland and Ireland should be really
29:28 easy because it's right there you know
29:31 like I went to the high school that my
29:33 parents went to all my aunts and uncles
29:35 went to and my grandmother went to was
29:38 built in like 1924 and so it had one
29:42 retrofit on it for a fourth floor I
29:44 think an extension on one side or
29:47 whatever they finally just tore it down
29:49 because that's what we do right we
29:51 toured we just retrofitted the entire
29:54 building to be absolutely perfect inside
29:56 I've never visiting it and walking
29:58 around the building and going oh my god
29:59 this is like really modern inside but it
30:01 was like a three three-story brick
30:04 building with like a fourth story that
30:05 was condemned which is kind of weird but
30:10 they had to tear it down and build a
30:11 single single-story
30:12 it's beautiful new high school and so
30:16 change is usually really difficult to
30:19 get a society to go through because of
30:21 nostalgia and then you have the fear of
30:24 change because change is where we make
30:26 mistakes and not everybody in a society
30:29 wants to go for that big risk well you
30:33 know I kind of like the wing ones run
30:34 right now you can call us whatever name
30:37 you want to call us and that's typically
30:39 how it works is that the globalists
30:41 attach all these new phrases on top of
30:45 you know you're a xenophobe yura you
30:47 know you're a racist or whatever no
30:49 one's like oh that's not us well okay
30:51 everybody can move here now it's like
30:53 it's insane what's funny is interesting
30:57 I guess I should say is that America has
30:59 350 million people roughly but why not
31:02 we go to Europe and hear about the
31:04 entire population of countries it's like
31:06 60 million here 30 million there you
31:09 know we got countries in Europe that
31:12 have less people or the same number of
31:14 people as la plus all of its surrounding
31:16 counties
31:17 there's many countries that are smaller
31:19 than Tokyo it's got 40 million people
31:22 and maybe that number allows that low
31:25 number allows the indoctrination and the
31:28 manipulation of Europe to be
31:30 far easier whereas in America we've got
31:33 electoral system and we just don't vote
31:36 into it you know for me it's a beautiful
31:40 vector for the mind to track to is to go
31:46 back and say well I mean you go to a
31:49 millennial today and say hey kid how do
31:52 you like the world that you know that's
31:54 right now do you think it's great do you
31:57 think your tax rates great do you think
31:59 your retirement capabilities are great
32:00 do you think your employment
32:02 opportunities are great how easy do you
32:05 think it's gonna be to get married and
32:06 have kids and put them all through
32:08 school what if you want your wife to
32:10 stay home and she wants to stay home and
32:12 raise the kids because you value this
32:14 connection with your children you don't
32:15 want to surrender them to the state just
32:18 as soon as they can walk what if that
32:21 kids said yeah I think it sucks I think
32:25 it's really hard you know my kid
32:27 lectures me all the time it's not as
32:28 easy to add as it was when you were a
32:30 kid no my god believe me I know and then
32:34 as a parent trying to be a guardian to
32:36 your child and you know I know that just
32:39 fixing my kids life is not going to fix
32:40 my kids life I have to fix all the kids
32:44 lives I have to fix society because my
32:47 kid lives in the platform of reality
32:49 that we have created and so we're
32:51 responsible were responsible for each
32:53 other we have one soul we should really
32:56 knock it out of the park shouldn't we I
32:58 read an article today it was on a
33:02 there's a website that I think probably
33:05 has more right than wrong but it's kind
33:07 of a heavy conspiracy website but it was
33:09 about a intelligence agent that
33:14 confessed that that day in September
33:17 2001 was an inside job that they really
33:21 blew these buildings up that everything
33:24 you were told about what happened was
33:25 wrong they revealed the fact that one of
33:28 the planned impacts never happened and
33:32 he said that the project was called a
33:35 project for a new century that's what
33:38 they call the code project right and
33:40 there's some neo-cons that have borrowed
33:41 that for a long time
33:43 you know the whole thing could be fake
33:44 but he did a sworn affidavit that he was
33:47 telling the truth
33:48 and we have another gentleman who was
33:50 involved with the third building that
33:52 fell in New York and he confessed to
33:54 being a part of that team to actually
33:56 get the demolition and explosives in
34:00 okay so there was this heavy heavy move
34:02 to destroy the world in the first year
34:05 of the 21st century which is 2001 that's
34:11 the way I see anyway you got to top off
34:13 the last one you get 2,000 goes to the
34:15 other one twentieth century has the
34:18 20-year in that century the way I see it
34:22 and so that put you know dystopian weird
34:28 1984 body cavity searches in airports it
34:33 rationalized every single security
34:36 checkpoint you could possibly conceive
34:39 and what's interesting is I forgot to
34:41 mention and watch it watch it turn on
34:44 now that I've said this but I haven't
34:46 seen the drunk driving checkpoints in
34:48 Huntington Beach for at least a year or
34:51 so because between my house and the
34:55 smoke lounge there's a place where they
34:57 love to do it and what's funny is if you
35:00 happen to turn off the road before the
35:04 checkpoint they have like by cops that
35:05 will chase you down like you're trying
35:07 to evade it like you're a [ __ ]
35:08 criminal and you're like no I live this
35:10 way I don't use this Main Street because
35:12 it's real busy as a bunch of drunks on
35:14 it you know good luck you should hang
35:16 out the bars I use this back row which
35:18 every local resident uses I just think
35:22 that you know the old adage No Country
35:26 for Old Men that's been around for
35:30 hundreds and hundreds if not thousands
35:32 of years that whole sentiment of older
35:34 men going well society sucks now I'm
35:36 older and it's not as good as it was
35:37 when I was a kid all right
35:40 but wouldn't it be interesting if we had
35:42 a court case where you had to prove it
35:46 do you know what I could personally
35:50 prove that 1989 to 1969 was way easier
35:54 of a lifestyle
35:56 then 1990 and up I could show the
36:01 societal cultural art that was coming
36:05 out degrading society you could prove it
36:09 we didn't have women you know called
36:12 [ __ ] and hoes and all that [ __ ] in
36:14 the in the 80s and 70s was there a guy
36:18 that did it oh sure but in terms of
36:20 music that came out on the radio that
36:22 said this is the way you should treat
36:24 somebody you know the to Live Crew blew
36:27 that whole thing up it was amazing and
36:31 you just take a small group of guys and
36:33 what's funny is most of these guys you
36:36 know
36:37 pardon the the the specificity here but
36:41 you have a bunch of guys that weren't
36:42 getting laid but they make raps like
36:45 they're getting laid a bunch and then
36:46 they get laid a bunch because they get
36:47 famous talking out of their ass right
36:50 but gun violence the gang violence the
36:53 drive-by shootings all that was in the
36:55 90s today musics a little more upbeat a
37:00 little bit more upbeat but there's still
37:04 no sign of like dedication to excellence
37:07 you know we've had movements in the past
37:10 where groups came out you know like the
37:12 Black Panthers and that kind of stuff
37:14 because they were tired of what they
37:15 were dealing with and so they met they
37:19 were they were living in a more violent
37:20 world I guess in this in sort of the bad
37:22 urban districts of the various major
37:25 cities so they rose up to fight back
37:27 brought violence to violence of course
37:30 their violence is bad and the cops
37:32 violence at the time was good but you
37:35 don't you just turn on the television
37:36 look at these old goofy television shows
37:41 we used to have they wouldn't have been
37:43 popular being good to everybody in the
37:46 show if everybody was hating on each
37:49 other because people were to watch the
37:51 shows in what man life is not like this
37:52 at all and I'm sure there's again
37:54 isolated districts that definitely had
37:57 that emotion
38:00 if you were living in the bombed-out
38:02 Bronx of New York trying to watch Leave
38:05 It to Beaver or the Brady Bunch you're
38:08 probably going geez look at these
38:09 crackers you know in their fantasy world
38:11 they live in
38:13 but no me throw this at you the more
38:17 awake you become the more you have to go
38:20 through that whole stage of like
38:22 accepting all of this crazy stuff that's
38:24 been going on and and the more you study
38:26 conspiracies as a whole you find out
38:29 that conspiracies have been the number
38:32 one method by which these bankers have
38:36 manipulated the entire world forever
38:39 ever since they came into power it's all
38:41 been a conspiracy constantly and what's
38:45 funny is you hear about conspiracies all
38:47 the time in the main stream history /
38:50 press but then if you get to the ones
38:53 that are darker oh that's when you get
38:56 the guy walking around the room going oh
38:57 man you believe the whole world's
38:59 conspiracies it's like what are you
39:01 watching on History Channel cuz all I'm
39:02 seeing is a ton of conspiracy you just
39:06 have had those in your life your entire
39:07 life and they're all Kay and cool and
39:11 the ones I'm talking about where I'm
39:14 clarifying an old one
39:15 you know like Lee Harvey Oswald shooting
39:17 Kennedy would have been in conspiracy no
39:18 matter how you worked it out it's you
39:22 know it's usually two or more people
39:24 conspiring against one or more people
39:26 King Tut was murdered you know that was
39:29 18 years old someone hit him in the head
39:31 and broke his skull open maybe he fell
39:35 off a cliff maybe he was assassinated
39:38 all the Caesars killing each other all
39:41 the leaders in Europe killing each other
39:43 franz ferdinand being murdered that's a
39:45 conspiracy a bunch of people threw
39:47 grenades at the guy and one guy finally
39:49 popped him in the head someone tried to
39:50 kill Andrew Jackson someone did kill
39:54 John Wilkes Booth was zapped Lincoln
39:57 Martin Luther King was murdered JFK was
39:59 murdered RFK was murdered Malcolm X was
40:01 murdered these things really occurred
40:04 and of course they love the Lone Gunmen
40:06 theory because that absolves anyone's
40:08 need to look for our true a group of
40:11 people that benefited from these people
40:13 deaths Vietnam was started on the to
40:16 fake events called the Gulf of Tonkin
40:19 Pearl Harbor was a complete inside job
40:21 and now normal historians know it the
40:25 Korean War was really a police a police
40:28 action to all those guys that got maimed
40:31 in Korea that it was just a police
40:35 action it was a full-on war the the
40:40 crash in 1929 total conspiracy of the
40:44 bank's to create a crash to steal all
40:46 the money stealing all of our gold by
40:49 1934 Roosevelt sold everybody out
40:52 conspiracy it's all over the place and
40:55 it's in mainstream world but now when we
40:58 start talking about all the pedophiles
41:01 and these child traffickers and human
41:04 traffickers and all this money
41:06 laundering and instigated Wars to create
41:09 you know just like a 1984 the war that's
41:11 never supposed to end because the enemy
41:13 is this sort of apparition it's not a
41:17 country it's a movement you know it's a
41:21 conspiracy all these fake Syrians moving
41:26 into Europe was that not a conspiracy so
41:31 nostalgia for me is sort of a gyroscope
41:35 at centrifuge of lucidity it's a it's a
41:42 beacon of order where society got things
41:46 right once maybe they hung on to it for
41:50 a year maybe they hung on to it for
41:52 decade multiple decades I happen to
41:54 think America for the most part had good
41:58 people that understood what was at stake
42:01 if they lost because they just finished
42:03 the Revolutionary War the war of 1812
42:07 you know we had again assassination
42:09 attempts on the presidents and then
42:11 assassinations of presidents used to be
42:14 this thing where every 20 years the
42:16 president was assassinated right
42:20 now it's not true in America but I want
42:24 you to see nostalgia as a method for
42:27 your mind to set a standard you're
42:30 setting a standard inside yourself to
42:32 say life was this good now if you have
42:35 nostalgia way back to your childhood
42:37 that's a little bit harder to recreate
42:39 but I think the goal would be to say of
42:42 the children that exist today are they
42:45 having that quality experience you have
42:47 when you were a kid they weren't told
42:49 about you know milk cartons weren't
42:52 covered with missing children which is a
42:54 horrific thing to do to children in the
42:55 first place you know by the time I had
42:59 you know I lived through I guess five
43:01 years of the Vietnam War and we're
43:03 watching that stuff on TV as a kid I
43:06 didn't understand the draft I didn't
43:08 know what that was my father had been in
43:11 and out of the military already and so
43:14 you know you wouldn't in during Vietnam
43:16 but he came out before my memory started
43:18 working and so by the time I started
43:19 really becoming sentient at six or seven
43:21 years old it was over life was better
43:25 everybody was tired of hating being in a
43:29 place they shouldn't have been risky in
43:32 life they shouldn't wrists etc etc right
43:34 I think one of the things we could do as
43:40 adults that's very simple very easy to
43:43 understand is that we had a method of
43:48 living in the past which a storyteller
43:52 might say an archetype right it's the
43:54 facets of a story that always occur and
43:58 so let's say we look back and we find
44:00 these areas that we really liked but
44:03 instead of just yearning for that time
44:05 machine to go back into that past which
44:08 we'll never be able to do this time is a
44:11 complete illusion right we could write
44:16 down and itemize what those worlds were
44:17 like and then dedicate ourselves to say
44:21 okay if anybody introduces anything
44:24 that's against these methods of managing
44:28 Society of educating children providing
44:31 jobs
44:32 monetizing money you know and how do you
44:34 how do you monetize your money how do
44:36 you manage debt all those things roll
44:41 back I mean it's hard to tell kids today
44:44 that credit cards are a very new thing
44:46 now credit and loans for banks aren't
44:49 new but my father was one of the first
44:52 generations to ever get a credit card
44:54 I'm everyone ATM cards were brand new
44:57 and ATM machines were brand new I know
45:00 that in my dad's generation a gigantic
45:03 portion of the male's who got credit
45:05 cards really thought of credit as free
45:07 money they never really contemplated
45:09 having to pay it back and so a lot easy
45:11 eyes went bankrupt and then bankruptcy
45:13 was like this big thing a divorce
45:15 followed all these credit cards and the
45:20 reason why credit cards get out of
45:21 control is because of what compound
45:23 interest its the algorithm of Ussery
45:26 that has raped cultures for thousands of
45:30 years but we still allow it to exist and
45:33 we we actually believe that it's
45:37 something that needs to occur if
45:40 somebody's right to do that it's like
45:44 now did we have to mature as a society
45:46 sure I give an example where America
45:51 desperately needed to mature because of
45:54 some brave souls and a very famous black
45:57 Republican named Martin Luther King we
46:01 got through this but we had segregation
46:04 we had racism in this country it took a
46:07 really long time you know the Democratic
46:10 Party was creating the KKK and the Jim
46:12 Crow thing and you know you had senator
46:16 Byrd being a Ku Klux Klan guy who
46:18 Hillary Clinton worships to this day
46:23 they were keeping everything divided the
46:27 Republican North Yankees wanted slaves
46:29 to be free and treated like human beings
46:30 in your Democratic South wanted to keep
46:33 it separated and again all these Antipa
46:37 people that tore down statues in the
46:40 south they're tearing down Democratic
46:43 leaders that's just the funniest thing
46:46 they think they're pounding on a
46:47 Republicans heads like nope that's your
46:49 party and you have this lie that you're
46:53 your party switched at some point I
46:55 think that's the funniest one so we had
46:59 to get out of this and luckily in the
47:00 60s before I was born this oppression
47:04 left and luckily I was raised in a state
47:06 that didn't really have as far as I know
47:10 that we didn't have two fountains on
47:11 buildings we didn't force blacks to go
47:13 in the back door you know it was just no
47:18 come on in but we're part of the Yankee
47:20 team so you know we take what's good
47:24 about the past or good about what we're
47:26 being nostalgic about and we leave
47:29 everything else behind but the most
47:32 intangible nostalgia that's tough to
47:35 process is the fact that the human mind
47:38 has evolved and and evolved at the same
47:42 exact time it is sort of a feeling of
47:45 mine that the modern day perception of
47:49 society is there's this globalist effort
47:52 telling you it's never been good you
47:56 know got these Democrats out there
47:57 saying well make America great well when
48:00 was it ever great oh yeah
48:03 there's your boat once you just go some
48:06 [ __ ] another place where it's so goddamn
48:08 awesome right again my friends you
48:12 travel the world and live in other
48:14 countries for years can't wait to get
48:16 home and they can't wait to get home
48:18 because they no longer worried about
48:20 disappearing where they live being
48:23 harassed by cops to the point where they
48:25 may not come home and no one's there to
48:28 help them but the human mind today in my
48:31 estimation is extremely scatterbrained
48:33 because an average youth is being at
48:36 act from every single angle as soon as
48:38 you turn 18 if your parents kick you out
48:42 because you're not going to college or
48:44 you manage to scrape in your your
48:46 bedroom as a child until you're 22 then
48:51 you get kicked out into society and then
48:53 you're trying to make ends meet and an
48:57 aggressive economy with globalism now a
49:01 lot of jobs that were always just
49:03 thought to be jobs that you did in
49:05 America because you live in America
49:07 where they've all been exported through
49:09 NAFTA Europe suffers the same problems
49:12 right Europe has already commandeered
49:16 every piece of land that could be
49:17 commandeered in their countries because
49:19 they've been there forever
49:20 I mean you folks living there laughing
49:22 at me talking about you in third person
49:24 but in America we have a ton of land
49:27 that we haven't really explored in terms
49:30 of resources and living so we got a lot
49:33 of room one of the sad things about the
49:37 the right of passage and I did an
49:39 episode on this a long time ago that was
49:41 in season two is that there's this
49:44 rebellious stage that is now
49:47 indoctrinated into the youth it happens
49:49 biologically but to what extreme has now
49:53 been largely owned because the
49:56 globalists understand one thing about
49:59 kids if they don't understand anything
50:00 else they understand this one as long as
50:03 you can get the parent get the kid away
50:05 from the parents then you own their
50:09 indoctrination so that when they get
50:13 through their get through their
50:14 biological natural state of rejecting
50:16 their parents because they want to own
50:17 their own life they want to make their
50:19 own decisions they're making decisions
50:21 that the globalists are thrown into
50:22 their brain where'd you get these an T
50:25 for kids from a super fascist bunch of
50:29 kids who say they're against fascism I
50:31 mean ha larious man unbelievable how
50:35 absolutely ignorant these kids are
50:37 they're being had by the system and then
50:41 even know it now luckily a lot of that's
50:43 calmed down a little bit but they still
50:45 have factions here and there and now
50:47 they're getting violent
50:49 they're getting violent in the name of
50:51 their own movement if you know their own
50:54 fascism it's unbelievable people people
50:57 who aren't like them boy you know dress
50:59 in black and hide your face like a big
51:01 [ __ ] then you're not one of them I want
51:05 to remind you too as long as your enemy
51:07 is not identified they could be from
51:09 anywhere in the world and you might
51:11 think they're kids from your backyard
51:12 but they've been flown in from another
51:13 country on a little weekend trip so they
51:17 can do this little protest and they're
51:18 back on planes and they're out of here
51:20 so I've had members of the lounge that I
51:25 go to the smoke and one guy said a
51:29 brilliant statement he goes I think that
51:30 there should be an executive order that
51:32 says if you're participating in any
51:34 protest in America at least you cannot
51:37 cover your face ever and you do straight
51:41 to jail straight to jail you do 90 days
51:44 in jail maybe it's an instant sentence
51:46 and you off to prison
51:47 have some fun kids and we'll see how
51:51 many these people get D mast handcuffed
51:54 and you find out they're not even
51:57 American citizens and then the Cabal and
51:59 the conspiracy actually blows up a
52:00 little bit such that the American people
52:02 can go oh I thought these were our kids
52:05 I think what our that one of the pieces
52:08 of nostalgia that is sort of lost in
52:11 globalism and it's part of their goal is
52:13 to knock down nationalism now
52:17 nationalism can get really bad if you
52:19 got a really if you can't really have
52:21 nationalism with a dictator I mean
52:22 that's that's where the two kind of
52:24 annihilate each other
52:26 what is it President Putin and President
52:29 Qi they have declared themselves
52:32 presidents for life all right maybe
52:36 there's a reason why China needs that
52:38 maybe there's a reason why Russia needs
52:39 that but I can tell you America doesn't
52:41 need that as much as I may like or
52:44 dislike a president let's say I'm
52:46 infatuated with the president I still
52:49 think two terms is pretty good because
52:52 we need to be able to do more than just
52:53 have one guy or one girl be able to run
52:56 the country well we need thousands and
52:58 you know it should be it should be such
53:01 that the education in a particular
53:02 country is
53:03 Thoreau and so truthful about true
53:07 history and conspiracies and how the
53:08 world has been turned upside down that
53:10 every candidate sits up at a podium and
53:13 not only is capable of saying how the
53:15 world really exists but as they provide
53:17 solutions these theoretical solutions
53:20 that they would put forth as a candidate
53:22 they're drawing from a standard that we
53:24 as a society have agreed to is it funny
53:28 how I say that and probably some of you
53:30 chuckled a little bit I think yeah
53:33 wouldn't that be great
53:34 it's not what's happening and you know I
53:36 think the thing that there there are
53:40 detrimental nostalgia angles and one of
53:46 those angles has to do with people being
53:49 very I want to say feudalistic but their
53:55 whole thing is that they just give up on
53:56 society that's the nostalgia that
53:58 they're used to
53:59 well you can't change anything it's
54:01 gonna be the way it is pretty soon we'll
54:03 have to join them and they just give up
54:04 on everything if they think the
54:06 presidential election is gonna be thrown
54:07 by the Democratic Party they just give
54:11 up but they'll want to complain as soon
54:15 as the you know the bad stuff starts
54:17 coming into the lie of high taxes
54:18 socialism also the crazy stuff they'll
54:20 be the first person to want to complain
54:21 about it they don't have any nuts to
54:23 stand up against tyranny so you know as
54:28 I think about this episode it's really
54:31 nostalgic could be a beautiful beacon
54:33 but again you just beacon the stuff
54:35 that's good you leave behind this stuff
54:37 that's bad so let's just say the 1940s
54:40 in America still had two water fountains
54:42 and a bunch of places in the south and
54:43 schools were still distill segregated
54:46 certain races weren't treated you know
54:48 fairly we obviously don't want to keep
54:51 that but if we now have fixed a part of
54:54 that then we take the stuff that's good
54:58 we mix everybody together and say hey
55:00 we're all gonna be doing this now just
55:02 not just the white people not just the
55:03 black people not just whatever
55:05 everyone's gonna do this and it's going
55:07 to be great here's what I think is
55:09 interesting for the especially my own
55:12 daughter and the kids that I were
55:15 I was around as a young man as they were
55:18 growing up it didn't take but a few
55:21 sessions with these kids and telling
55:23 them about some of the bad things that
55:27 life can throw at you if you get
55:28 irresponsible like obviously if you have
55:30 a daughter you're trying to keep her
55:32 from sleeping around you're trying to
55:35 keep her from being pregnant before
55:36 she's a woman before she's married
55:38 before she's got an institution where
55:40 she can have some physical health
55:42 financial help spiritual help and these
55:46 kids like almost one-for-one got that in
55:51 their head early thought about it and
55:53 when they hit their you know their rite
55:56 of passage
55:56 they messed around with their authority
55:59 figures and their sort of direction in
56:03 life but they didn't mess around with
56:04 those things because you got it into
56:05 their head early enough it was just a
56:07 part of them but there's so many kids
56:10 out there that you know mothers don't
56:12 teach their daughters about
56:14 administration they don't teach them
56:16 about ovulation they don't teach them
56:17 how they get pregnant they don't teach
56:19 them how to have sex I mean and so
56:21 they're I mean again I met a girl who
56:23 had two kids and one on the way and
56:25 didn't know what ovulation was and she
56:27 didn't want to be pregnant the third
56:28 time and so I asked her I said well do
56:31 you know when you ovulate what's that oh
56:34 my god is it her fault
56:37 no it's her mother's fault teach your
56:39 kids the basics of life would you
56:42 it's a nostalgic idea I know but this is
56:46 where we have failed our next generation
56:49 I think one of the things you can tell a
56:52 young person hopefully before the
56:54 thirteen years old is to say don't you
56:56 want to live a better life don't you
56:59 want to live in a life where you can
57:00 trust people I mean we're not saying you
57:03 go out immediately trust people because
57:05 right now you're surrounded by a bunch
57:06 of scumbags that will steal from you and
57:09 lie to you and and your leaders will
57:12 promise you one thing and the last thing
57:14 you're ever going to get to the thing
57:15 they promised you as a matter of fact if
57:17 your president says you can keep your
57:19 doctor keep your plann and you're gonna
57:21 have health care even if you have a
57:22 pre-existing condition those are all the
57:25 things that are never going to happen
57:26 you if they say it's an affordable
57:29 healthcare act it's gonna be so
57:31 expensive you can't afford it you know
57:33 one of the things I forgot to mention
57:34 about the guy that came into the lounge
57:36 that I made an episode about is that he
57:40 was talking about health care and of
57:41 course he's got this crutch he's like
57:42 well don't you think everyone deserves
57:44 health care more like he had and I
57:46 remember when I was a kid in in my 20s
57:48 as a software engineer Here I am totally
57:51 healthy why the hell do I need a ton of
57:53 [ __ ] health care right I bought
57:55 emergency healthcare insurance was a 99
57:57 bucks a month and it was to help me if I
58:01 got in a car accident lost a limb you
58:04 know something bad happened and it kicks
58:05 in but I also had a five dollar copay
58:08 for a hundred bucks a month I wasn't a
58:12 part of an insurance group I was a part
58:15 of all the other kids out there that
58:17 were doing the same exact thing buying a
58:19 hundred dollar healthcare for
58:21 emergencies only
58:23 my friends in Texas a husband wife and a
58:28 child all three extremely healthy never
58:31 had any issues were paying nearly $1,500
58:35 a month after the first year of Obama's
58:37 health care Oh big surprise he let the
58:42 insurance companies the pharmaceutical
58:43 companies write the policy and he just
58:46 signed it the guy was a complete
58:50 disgusting anti-american shill trying to
58:53 sell us out to the globalists nostalgia
58:56 had it been a part of our fabric had had
58:59 been a part of what we say can and can't
59:01 happen would have prevented that from
59:04 occurring
59:05 the second that stuff turned up to be
59:08 super duper expensive and let's not
59:09 forget the multi-billion dollar website
59:12 they created that couldn't handle the
59:14 first registration cycle okay as a web
59:17 engineer let me tell you I was a head
59:20 architect of a three hundred and twenty
59:21 million dollar gaming platform that
59:24 could have handled 20 million
59:25 consecutive players at the same exact
59:27 time getting it to a billion dollars in
59:31 the 21st century by 2010 this is almost
59:35 I guess it's ten years after I did the
59:38 other thing
59:39 it's an insane level of money some they
59:43 should have just grabbed that dude and
59:44 thrown him into the [ __ ] ocean man
59:46 you have lied to us you have stolen our
59:49 money we got a bunch of kids strung out
59:52 on college loans for degrees that are
59:54 unemployable and you're wasting this
59:55 kind of money was that the Mueller
59:58 reports now risen to a 40 million dollar
60:02 line item which doesn't sound like much
60:05 for our country but that's 400 college
60:07 degrees paid for if they had $100,000
60:09 debt apiece what's that the billionaire
60:13 dude that just went to the inaugural
60:15 speech and an all-black male college he
60:17 just paid for everyone everyone's degree
60:20 hats off to that dude
60:22 talk about nostalgia talk about a guy
60:25 with standards I mean I don't know if
60:30 he's cut the check yet but if he does he
60:32 should have a statue made of him at that
60:35 college and everyone else that comes
60:38 through they're like that's our bar he
60:42 set the bar you're Bill Gates you've got
60:45 billions and billions of dollars and you
60:47 want us to listen to your horseshit
60:48 about [ __ ] making volcanoes erupt to
60:51 protect the sky from the Sun you want it
60:53 you totally support vaccinations that
60:55 depopulate the world you bragging about
60:58 chemtrails now manipulating weather not
61:01 impressed dude get your bank account out
61:04 and write a billion dollars worth of
61:06 checks to kids that are suffering in
61:09 this world and guess what you they may
61:11 actually follow what you have to say
61:13 because they never want to part with
61:15 their cash do they even though they have
61:17 more money than they'll ever spend in
61:19 their entire lifetime some of these
61:22 people you know showboat and give money
61:24 to globalist organizations like the UN
61:27 as if they've done anything for you
61:30 remember Kofi Annan's kid man sex for
61:34 food in Africa it's horrific horrific
61:37 women getting raped to have enough food
61:40 so they could feed their families yeah
61:43 this that's the UN for you one of the
61:46 nostalgic things we used to have was
61:48 that our forefathers and people you know
61:50 all the way up to like Teddy Roosevelt
61:53 we only elected people that have been
61:55 successful in their personal lives if
61:58 they were a real successful businessmen
62:01 you know now we can put business women
62:03 in this game too they're they they do
62:07 understand the human condition if you
62:09 built a gigantic corporation by yourself
62:11 like a Steve Jobs did or you know again
62:14 Gates's bill was a little bit different
62:16 and full of conspiracy but there's a lot
62:18 of good people out there that
62:20 potentially could look at the government
62:22 and say look what's the biggest
62:24 suffering moment for a particular
62:25 country and its really the monetary
62:27 system I just watched a great I guess
62:33 you could call it a mini documentary
62:34 where this guy dispelled ten myths about
62:38 the financial system in America and what
62:40 our debt really is made out of and how
62:43 much were in debt and how long and what
62:45 methods we would use to fix our economy
62:49 and it came down to number 10 after
62:53 proving that the America is in debt
62:55 probably at a comfortable estimate about
62:58 150 trillion dollars most of it through
63:01 Ponzi scheme money that we talked about
63:03 through the Federal Reserve if America
63:05 cut its budget 10% and held it for 10
63:09 years and in 10 years we'd have a
63:12 balanced budget and if we held that for
63:14 a hundred years then we would be able to
63:17 service all this illegal debt that we
63:18 have now the best way is to cut off the
63:23 fiat currency in just basically tell
63:26 them that was a criminal endeavor the
63:29 way you created our money was a Ponzi
63:31 scheme which means it's an impossible
63:32 algorithm to ever pay back so all the
63:34 debt owed to you we're considering that
63:36 zero do your best to come after us
63:40 because we just gave our military the
63:43 most money they've ever had in their
63:44 existence and they're gonna get really
63:46 formidable and just try to do your war
63:48 of 1812 this time around countries in
63:52 Europe that have divorced themselves
63:54 from fiat currency are doing great some
63:57 countries are still in it and they're
63:59 making moves to get out of it but as
64:01 long as they're part of the EU it's
64:04 going to be imposed on them
64:06 nostalgia is a great beacon isn't it
64:09 it's previous bars previous standards
64:12 that were set for society I think the
64:15 world should be re-engineered to a point
64:17 where a mother could stay home with
64:19 their kids until they're old enough to
64:20 go drive themselves to school and then
64:22 mom goes off and either takes the
64:24 previous degree she had before she had
64:26 her kids or the degree she's gonna get
64:27 after her kids and she's gonna enjoy it
64:31 because raising kids is harder than
64:33 going to college and so she's gonna have
64:35 just a blessed experience and she should
64:38 have the freedom to do that she should
64:40 have the money to do that and for the
64:42 women that want to go into the workforce
64:43 and ever have any kids they just
64:46 immediately go into the workforce
64:48 algorithm which is also amazing they
64:50 never have any kids while they're
64:51 earning enough money to have kids
64:53 they're earning enough money to put a
64:54 husband at home to raise the kids
64:56 great who cares what sex stays home as
64:59 long as there's that bond for the kids
65:01 the kids get out of school and dad or
65:03 mom is right there with the car before
65:05 they can drive themselves picks them up
65:06 takes them home takes them to their
65:08 baseball game and they're ballerina in a
65:10 class or whatever it is get some jazz
65:13 hands going on and maybe there's places
65:16 in Europe to still do this they can do
65:19 this when I got into software
65:22 engineering and the Bay Area our company
65:25 was centered in England and we had the
65:28 75 person annex in the United States
65:32 over there you got much less pay but you
65:37 got a company car you left at five
65:39 o'clock you didn't have to work on
65:41 weekends and you had a life these people
65:43 had two vacations a year the United
65:45 States same exact company got paid more
65:48 but we had less money at the end of the
65:49 day because our country was
65:51 quantitatively easing which meant you
65:53 know stealing all the money out of our
65:55 savings accounts and inflating the cost
65:57 of everything so in a world like we live
66:00 in today it's best to spend all your
66:03 money right away because your savings is
66:06 just going to get bled to death right
66:08 again one of the things in this little
66:10 documentary I think is worth mentioning
66:11 in this episode is let's just say you've
66:16 made $50,000 a year and your
66:19 car cost your luxury car costs $30,000
66:22 just making 50k you got a car you can
66:24 get a loan for for 30 K then you put
66:28 $10,000 in the bank account but they
66:32 quantitatively ease money thus devaluing
66:35 money you're paid a hundred thousand
66:37 dollars now the car that was thirty is
66:39 now sixty so everything is actually out
66:41 there costs pretty much the same it's
66:43 only relative to the value of money but
66:46 the ten grand you have in your bank
66:47 account if you still have it by the time
66:50 it races in the plates to X now that ten
66:53 thousand dollars is only has five
66:55 thousand dollars worth of buying power
66:56 and that's how they steal from this
66:59 steal from us when they quantitatively
67:00 ease if that's still a little confusing
67:03 just think about in the previous era
67:06 you're making fifty in the car is thirty
67:08 you take your ten grand and you put it
67:09 down on the car you only owe 20 fast
67:12 forward to a 2x inflation the car cost
67:15 sixty you take your ten you put it on
67:17 the sixty thousand dollar car now you
67:18 owe 50 on the car
67:19 twenty grand more than you did in the
67:22 previous from the previous era the
67:24 nostalgic previous era you know and the
67:27 funny thing is is I always look back and
67:29 because I was at video games forever I
67:32 wonder you know that the Terry 2600 came
67:35 out in the late 70s and then the
67:38 ColecoVision the Intellivision and a few
67:39 other you know the Nintendo system and I
67:43 try to think back to my mind of like
67:44 okay what were my friends doing when I
67:45 was a kid and then what were we doing
67:47 after these game consoles came out
67:49 because initially they were so expensive
67:51 that not every family had one then it
67:53 was like every family had one that
67:54 arcades existed that sort of thing
67:57 but we were sitting at home when I was a
68:00 kid with our guitars trying to learn how
68:03 to play drums were a little hard to get
68:06 a hold of because they made so much
68:07 noise parents didn't want to have those
68:08 in the house so the kids that got the
68:09 drum sets early dominated because not a
68:12 lot of kids knew how to pound the kid
68:15 you know but I have to say as I watch
68:18 this the 80s mature we were celebrating
68:21 bands that made their skill sets in the
68:23 70s before these game consoles came out
68:25 and the funny thing is when I talked to
68:28 my 80s rock buddies with all the
68:30 platinum records and I say well huh you
68:33 know
68:33 what was your life like when you were
68:35 learning your instrument how did you get
68:37 in your first band and all this other
68:38 stuff it's all 70s because they're about
68:39 10 years older than me there's no talk
68:43 of hanging out in arcades there's no
68:44 talk of playing on these gaming consoles
68:47 they were at home studying their
68:50 instruments because why it was a
68:54 nostalgic era where that was the only
68:55 game in town interesting right and again
69:00 when you go into a an elevator a
69:03 department store it's playing like
69:05 elevator music or whatever you go into
69:06 these themed restaurants even
69:08 restaurants that are not themed and
69:09 they're playing music other than a few
69:13 in LA that are very kitschy and cliche
69:18 or I should say clicky it's all music
69:21 from the 80s or further back no one's
69:24 playing that nighti [ __ ]
69:25 you want to eat supper and listen to
69:28 [ __ ] Nine Inch Nails you want to
69:30 listen to Pearl Jam and Nirvana and all
69:35 that I mean there's some Nirvana songs
69:37 that are pretty generic but it's all
69:39 depressing and they don't want you to be
69:41 depressed while you're eating your food
69:42 and then they can't go hip-hop and pop
69:46 because that stuff's either too teeny
69:49 Bop or again still gangster related
69:51 mindsets I mean today if you think about
69:55 you know go to tmz.com every once in a
69:57 while and you look at sort of how the
69:59 left wants to engineer the world because
70:00 that's what that websites all about we
70:04 just lost the Nipsey Hussle Nipsey
70:06 Hussle right this guy was out trying to
70:07 champion a cancer cure he was really
70:10 trying to reveal the Cabal so it was
70:12 Tupac back in the day but these guys get
70:15 shot now all right well let's go back to
70:19 the 70s in the 80s what what rockers
70:21 were getting shot what rappers were
70:25 getting shots those rappers from the 80s
70:28 are still alive when they do these these
70:30 documentaries on Netflix to see how the
70:32 hip-hop industry came about they can go
70:35 back and talk to all those guys they're
70:36 on television shows now they make movies
70:38 they own studios they own was that Cool
70:41 J and Ice Cube or now buying a big part
70:44 of ESPN or something like that
70:47 they're totally successful because they
70:51 didn't live in that negative era and
70:52 believe me every day those guys wake up
70:54 they live in the nostalgic standards of
70:56 the past you know part of the way you
70:59 can measure today versus yesterday is to
71:01 say if your kids grew up and became the
71:04 people that they worship in celebrity
71:06 circles would you be a happy person or
71:09 would you consider yourself an abject
71:11 failure as a parent I don't know you
71:16 know there when Nipsey Hussle was
71:17 talking about this cure to cancer and I
71:19 can't remember what shows on he was on
71:20 some radio show but they also filmed it
71:23 it automatically went around the
71:25 conspiracy circles this guy is now got a
71:27 target on his back and before you know
71:29 it the guy's dead I'm he's dead within a
71:31 year doing that interview and so we're
71:33 all kind of going oh well we know that
71:35 the deep state would love the guy dead
71:37 but he's also in this gangster lifestyle
71:41 because that's what his maybe his
71:43 preview I don't know anything about the
71:45 guy's a childhood but seems like he grew
71:47 up in a tougher area and he stayed true
71:49 to that tougher area and so when he was
71:51 shot it was like well there's a hundred
71:52 guys that would shoot that dude why cuz
71:55 he has what they want it's that is that
71:59 amazing song that Cool J made on his
72:01 bigger and Deffer album called
72:02 breakthrough one of the lyrics was the
72:05 the problem is you want what another man
72:07 has his car his wife or his razzamatazz
72:09 but that's weak you got to do work on
72:12 your own because when you're rich you
72:13 got friends but when you're poor you're
72:15 alone that song has got more
72:19 pound-for-pound advice for a kid in the
72:21 ghetto that any song I've ever heard
72:24 ever and it's easy to understand it's
72:27 positive and it's got all the
72:30 braggadocious stuff that they used to do
72:32 back in the 80s but part of it was you
72:33 wanted to be like Cool J depending on
72:36 where you came from either symbolically
72:38 wanted to be in command of your life and
72:40 focused to get your goals or you wanted
72:43 to be exactly who that guy was that guy
72:47 has an empire now so I guess the point
72:49 I'm trying to make is that try not to
72:52 dismiss the power of nostalgia because
72:57 it's now provable in a court of law that
73:01 we have created a crappier version of
73:03 society there are parts of society that
73:05 are fantastic and better but we have I
73:09 think more than 51% that's gone
73:11 backwards and we have to live in it our
73:14 kids have to live in it
73:16 hopefully this gin Z that let that
73:19 little girl on YouTube
73:21 so it's LT Corbis is their name their
73:25 channels SOP H still got up on YouTube
73:28 she's very coarse she's very raw she
73:30 makes me look like a saint in terms of
73:32 my language she's definitely a rated-r
73:34 kind of girl but she's been rated R
73:36 since she was 11 and someone might
73:37 consider that to be a failure of her
73:39 parents but in in a time when we live in
73:42 a world where it's like here
73:45 eleven-year-old here inherit this
73:48 totally shitty world that we as adults
73:49 have allowed to recur because most of
73:52 these people still have their head in
73:53 the sand and this little girl's like
73:55 screw you I don't like your world I
73:57 don't like the music that sucks out
74:00 there I don't like the fact that you
74:01 allow adults to marry children I don't
74:04 like pedophilia I don't like all this
74:05 stuff I don't like the way schools are
74:08 run she's got a couple videos on how
74:10 schools are managed and she's right you
74:11 know these kids are spending well she
74:15 said that her school starts at 7:30 in
74:17 the morning so she goes look we have to
74:18 get up at 6:30 in the morning get
74:20 dressed eat and travel to school so she
74:23 goes there's been all these scientific
74:26 studies about how younger people don't
74:30 really have brain function until about
74:32 10 o'clock in the morning and they
74:34 naturally wake up later in the morning
74:36 but we just say screw that you don't get
74:39 a chance to it's like boot camp or
74:40 something right a boot camp is for 19
74:43 year old 18 year old kids they're ready
74:45 for that regiment but a 11 year old kid
74:49 should probably be sleeping until 8:00
74:50 and going to bed around 11 o'clock
74:53 they've also studied that they've study
74:54 how kids naturally get sleepy between
74:57 10:00 and 11:00 but these kids have to
74:58 go to sleep at 7 or 8 if they want to
75:00 have eight hours of sleep to get up for
75:02 their school's cycle the next day but
75:03 they're sent almost so much homework
75:06 that's impossible
75:08 she also gave a little example I'll
75:10 share with you before I close out here
75:11 because I think it's sort of indicative
75:13 of again losing our standards in society
75:18 those kids obviously a prodigy and the
75:21 nice thing about her is that she doesn't
75:22 throw it on her face she barely ever
75:25 brags about herself if she ever does but
75:29 she said she was listening to her
75:30 teacher talk about something fairly
75:33 mundane that she already understood but
75:35 the teacher had also handed out a three
75:36 question like a homework thing so she's
75:41 listening to the teacher and she's
75:42 finishing the questions it's no problem
75:45 for her brain to listen to both sides so
75:47 we got a prodigy kid on our hands but
75:48 what's the teacher do according to her
75:51 teacher realized that she had done the
75:54 questions during her dissertation or
75:57 whatever it was snatched the piece of
75:59 paper out and said you can come to get
76:01 you come get this piece of paper after
76:03 school's out our class is over I think
76:06 it was school's out though and then
76:08 we're I'm just gonna delay your progress
76:10 I'm gonna stunt you down to the dumbest
76:11 kid in this class who needs to listen to
76:14 me and not do anything else and then do
76:16 their tests so we're taking a kid that
76:18 would otherwise be a prodigy and by
76:20 design pulling her down I can't speak
76:24 for any other country but the education
76:26 in America is completely different in
76:28 all 50 states
76:28 what they teach is different in all 50
76:31 states as much as they have this core
76:33 curriculum crap that's trying to unify
76:34 that stuff Yeah right it doesn't work
76:38 like that go talk to teachers go talk to
76:41 a teacher of Massachusetts and then talk
76:42 to a teacher in in the southern region
76:45 of Chicago and just see what they teach
76:48 their kids ask him how many of the kids
76:50 pass I mean really pass first is getting
76:53 that kind of like you know every child
76:55 left behind boot to the next grade I
76:58 started seeing this when I went to
77:00 college in the early 90s you know I said
77:04 this once before a long time ago but you
77:08 know I was a pretty proficient computer
77:11 programmer by 18 got a professional job
77:13 doing it at 18 and then I said you know
77:18 I need to go back and get my degree
77:19 because at some point someone's going to
77:21 care
77:22 I just I want to learn too when I
77:24 learned something maybe I haven't
77:25 learned so I go to the college and what
77:27 I want to learn is C++ object oriented C
77:30 and they said well you can't take this
77:32 class and C take all these other classes
77:34 okay well I do this professionally not
77:37 doesn't matter you got to take these
77:38 other classes and so I went and spent a
77:40 year and a half
77:41 taking three classes and then I walk
77:44 into the C++ class and I sit down and
77:48 what's the teacher start teaching us a
77:49 bunch of crap that was in the other
77:51 three classes and so I was like maybe
77:56 this is gonna get better so I went to a
77:58 couple more classes and then I was like
78:00 this is not moving forward we're gonna
78:02 spend the first half of this advanced
78:05 class in the past and so I went up to
78:07 the teacher this woman who actually ran
78:09 the entire computer science department
78:11 at DeAnza College I think in 1992 or so
78:14 and I said what's the deal with teaching
78:17 us all this old stuff I was told I
78:19 couldn't get in this class unless I took
78:21 the prerequisites so what are you doing
78:23 teaching this old stuff and she said
78:24 well some of the people didn't take the
78:26 prerequisites but I'm like are you
78:29 joking I talked to the counselor I came
78:33 in as a professional credited programmer
78:36 who helped invent a package that the
78:37 whole world is using at least the whole
78:39 country's using and I gotta go through
78:41 this these three classes but the kids in
78:45 here don't it was [ __ ] I never
78:48 walked in that class again I just quit I
78:50 was like screw this man I'm not gonna
78:51 sit around doing this stuff again I
78:53 guarantee you had computer science
78:55 existed in the 60s that wouldn't
78:58 happened there would have been rules you
79:01 follow the rules you get the information
79:04 or someone could have looked at my
79:06 background yeah yeah you can go on to
79:07 C++ because it sent me with a warning
79:11 well you may not know everything you
79:12 think you know so you might suffer in
79:14 that class if you don't know the basics
79:16 I make a decision I go into that class
79:19 and I start failing I go oh gosh I got
79:21 to drop out and go to this other classes
79:22 and it's my decision yes
79:28 I just threw my cigar and it landed in
79:31 my planter pot over there that I put on
79:34 my cigar butts in half I'd finally did
79:36 it should have recorded that I hope you
79:38 filled me on this one
79:39 I'd be interested in your whole take on
79:42 this thing like where are the standards
79:45 that you remember that have been lost in
79:47 society and I think one of the most
79:50 valuable opinions we could get in the
79:51 comment section would be any of you in
79:53 Europe you know I get I get people knee
79:58 jerking you know because they think I'm
80:00 trying to say America is better than
80:01 every other place in the world it's like
80:03 well I like where I live but you like
80:05 where you live it's all a relative thing
80:07 but one of the biggest problems with
80:08 expressing an opinion about another
80:10 place is we don't know anything about
80:12 those other places you can go on a
80:14 one-month vacation and know nothing
80:15 about a country so you guys who are
80:20 listening to the show from from abroad
80:22 wherever you are in the world it's not
80:24 that it's not America please you know
80:27 inform us educate us educate me I'll
80:29 pass it on in other episodes as it comes
80:32 up so anyway if you haven't been at deep
80:34 thoughts radio calm please go that's
80:36 where you can change feeds from audio to
80:37 video there's a lot Facebook group with
80:39 some of the coolest people on planet
80:40 earth there's a Twitter account in case
80:41 you like to get your feeds that way
80:42 there's two ways to donate to the show
80:44 there's patreon for a monthly thing
80:45 again if you get onto patreon put a buck
80:48 in at least you get all these videos
80:50 before everybody else gets them - maybe
80:52 one or two a month the patreon account
80:56 doesn't have a lot of active discussions
80:57 so just know if you do get in there you
80:59 do get a pipeline directly to me it's
81:01 much easier for me to find patreon
81:02 comments than it is to find YouTube
81:03 comments I do my best to get in and
81:06 weigh in on the YouTube comments
81:08 so please bear with me if I'm not
81:10 answering or reflecting on something
81:12 brilliant that you've said and the other
81:15 thing is we have a link to the new
81:16 remastered 7 season one as of this
81:20 recording I have just entered the 60s
81:22 like I just opposed 262 today so that'll
81:26 be done probably in the next month I'm
81:29 trying to do like four or five a day and
81:31 then that'll get rid of all the backlog
81:33 [ __ ] shoot is working fantastic so
81:35 again it's not a terribly big deal at
81:39 this point because YouTube is still
81:41 being fairly generous with
81:42 our videos to be up there now some
81:44 channels are getting supposedly taken
81:47 down you know they could they could cite
81:51 anything from your videos because they
81:54 change their standards they don't
81:55 publish their rules so this channel
81:56 could literally disappear overnight so
81:58 please remember that it will be on [ __ ]
82:01 shoot if that ever does occur as soon as
82:04 bright - yawns 2.0 comes out I'm gonna
82:06 give that another try I will try it much
82:09 harder to work with their support staff
82:11 even if it doesn't work even if I have
82:13 to say here's a Google Drive with my
82:16 videos could you please upload them for
82:17 me if that's what needs to happen
82:19 because I think this should be out there
82:21 and shouldn't be censored in any way
82:23 shape or form anyway take care of
82:26 yourself and someone else and I'll see
82:27 you in the next deep thoughts over now
