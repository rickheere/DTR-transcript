00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:32 deep thoughts today's episode idea came
00:35 from the strangest place we're sitting
00:40 at the lounge
00:42 going over the day's politics listening
00:45 to reviews of the impeachment trials
00:50 which our most consummate embarrassing
00:54 thing America has ever had to show the
00:55 public and I think it was the Greg
00:58 Kinnear guy to come saying his name
01:01 right these guys on the show he's really
01:04 funny he's unfuck but you know he's just
01:08 a super smart clever guy who seems to
01:12 think for himself which is good you
01:16 never get the feeling that he's toing
01:18 some globalist [ __ ] or being told by
01:21 his editor or his producer what to say
01:24 you know but he made a point that I
01:28 think is gigantic and what's interesting
01:31 about it is it was a gigantic point that
01:36 I think applies to the entire planet and
01:40 it's become a mental technology go see
01:44 my episode on mental technologies to
01:46 fully grasp that whole concept but it's
01:49 about lying and it's about lying in the
01:55 context of the future and his point
01:58 horribly paraphrase most likely but this
02:01 episode is gonna really get into it as
02:08 he said that you know I think he was
02:11 mainly talking about the impeachment
02:12 trials but he keeps saying that these
02:14 Democrats these politicians that are
02:17 Democrats that are scumbags being
02:20 defined as Nancy Pelosi Adam Schiff
02:23 Chuck Schumer Nadler they're scaring
02:28 their base by lying about what is going
02:31 to happen in the future I don't even
02:34 think he got as deep as we're gonna take
02:36 it on this episode but boy
02:38 it just this bell ring in my head and I
02:40 was like but that in the list we're do
02:43 it tonight I want you to look at all the
02:46 things that are these ridiculous agendas
02:50 that we are dealing with right now that
02:53 are all future based prediction lies and
02:57 fear-mongering now there are some things
03:01 that we do acknowledge as potential
03:05 future issues and then we prepare for
03:10 them and then we just relax and go about
03:12 our lives that's the reward of preparing
03:14 for something that could occur for
03:18 instance if you live in a hurricane area
03:20 tornado area or an earthquake area you
03:24 will maybe put some provisions away
03:27 maybe you'll get yourself a shelter
03:29 figured out either it's something you
03:31 build or you know a place you can go
03:34 perhaps you plan for a fire in your
03:36 house and you've got the ladders if
03:37 you're on a second floor get your kids
03:39 educated about how to do this perhaps
03:42 you get a firearm for your house just in
03:45 case that one-in-a-million situation
03:46 happens where a burglar comes in the
03:50 home invader comes in all right so you
03:55 don't keep it in the case you don't keep
03:57 it in a safe you keep it all [ __ ]
03:58 loaded and ready to rock and roll keep
04:02 it close but that's not what we're
04:06 talking about what we're talking about
04:09 is climate change slash previously
04:13 global warming we're talking about Peak
04:18 Oil we're talking about population
04:21 control we're talking about predicting
04:25 especially in the case of Trump they're
04:27 trying to scare their base the Trump is
04:29 going to turn into something that he
04:30 hasn't turned into already right he's
04:33 waiting for his second term to become
04:35 Hitler is what they'll tell you what is
04:39 NASA do NASA tells you you need us
04:42 because there might be an earth killing
04:45 asteroid out there and we're going to
04:47 not only develop technology to detect it
04:49 we're gonna have impossible odds of
04:51 physics
04:52 to get rid of the thing why do we lose
04:56 our fourth amendment in America that no
04:58 one seems to give a [ __ ] because of the
05:00 potential future terrorist attacks why
05:05 do we have the TSA groping everyone
05:06 especially old ladies and kids and
05:09 airports the future possible threats of
05:15 terrorism why can't I take it to bat
05:17 toothpaste it's full size on a plane
05:18 even though it could prove it's
05:21 toothpaste why can't I take a bottle of
05:24 [ __ ] water on there that I bought
05:26 from outside because of all this
05:30 ridiculous threat mongering crap that
05:34 something bad could happen to you oh
05:35 yeah well I'm going to take a drink of
05:38 this water and if it's poison if it's
05:41 half of nitroglycerin I'm gonna die
05:43 immediately so if as long as I can drink
05:47 it and continue walking into the airport
05:48 you're good if there's some substance I
05:52 could carry in my stomach without dying
05:53 that I could just drink all the all the
05:55 explosive and then barf it back up and
05:57 use it to blow up the plane I mean it's
05:59 just nothing makes any [ __ ] sense
06:01 whatsoever for a lot of snowflakes
06:06 they're trying to tell them that killing
06:09 the people that have the things that
06:11 they wanted or want because they worked
06:15 really really hard
06:16 they got educated they didn't cry when
06:21 someone didn't get elected but now they
06:24 deserve what the other people have if
06:27 they just got rid of all of the a and C
06:29 Ark people the BR people would do great
06:32 and that's a little homage to
06:35 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy by
06:36 Douglas Adams in that story they they
06:43 have a situation in the book second book
06:47 where the main characters least two of
06:50 them land on this ship in the middle of
06:54 outer space they just end up in it
06:55 because of the way they travel they can
06:57 suddenly appear anywhere
06:59 and they find out they're on this Ark
07:02 with millions of people inside stasis
07:06 but there's a few people that are alive
07:08 in fact the captain's been taking a bath
07:09 for two or three years he's got this
07:13 numskull guard who's never been able to
07:15 arrest anyone so as soon as he finds
07:17 these two guys he goes absolutely
07:18 berserk with all of his yelling and
07:20 shouting and stuff and what they find
07:23 out is that their home planet told them
07:27 all a story because they're all morons
07:28 right sounds just like the Democrats
07:31 right they're all morons and they tell
07:33 them this [ __ ] future story about an
07:35 impending doom on their planet and
07:37 everyone had a different story and some
07:39 of the stories are hilarious and so they
07:43 said we're building three arks the a the
07:46 B and the C and the B is gonna go first
07:49 and so they put all the [ __ ] social
07:52 justice warrior snowflakes on the b and
07:54 ship them off to this planet telling
07:58 them that we need you to get there first
08:00 because we're gonna need phones to be
08:02 sanitized we need marketing departments
08:05 all of the frivolous [ __ ] that
08:07 destroys the world I mean Douglas Adams
08:09 was so [ __ ] ahead of his time it's
08:10 crazy well the obvious story is that the
08:15 a and the C was never made they just got
08:17 rid of the swill off their planet by
08:20 telling him the future lie sadly they
08:23 landed on earth and they became mankind
08:25 and that's the other absolutely
08:27 hilarious irony of that story and so now
08:32 what we have is your frivolous worthless
08:35 by their own negligence human beings
08:40 that are trying to get rid of all the
08:42 productive focused happy pretty people
08:45 and it doesn't mean you're genetically
08:47 pretty it means that you are happy and
08:50 they're pretty right you can look like
08:53 anything and be sexy as hell I've told
08:55 the story long long time ago three or
08:57 four years ago when I was stuck in the
08:59 Bay Area for like 12 years I would take
09:03 trips back down to Southern California
09:06 and just mourn but I didn't live here
09:08 anymore
09:09 I go to Venice Beach
09:11 and there was this black girl once on
09:13 the beach and she was I don't know how
09:16 much she weighed probably little over
09:17 200 pounds probably bout five seven or
09:19 so and she wore this skimpy little
09:22 bikini it was just so struggling to hang
09:25 on to her body but she was so confident
09:29 and she had a whole gaggle of friends
09:30 around her and she was in charge and
09:34 just the way that she had pretty pretty
09:36 face but she was just moving around and
09:38 just owned it and I remember it was like
09:41 this profound moment for me where I was
09:43 going I'm typically not attracted to
09:45 overweight women but this girl was sexy
09:49 this girl was cool this girl was
09:51 everything on the outside at least to
09:53 her persona I don't know who she really
09:55 was but she just had this aura and I was
09:58 like man you know it was like you go
10:01 girls go know what I was thinking in my
10:02 head but I was just I could see myself
10:04 being absolutely intoxicated by this
10:06 woman and I loved it it taught me
10:09 something don't judge the book by its
10:12 cover
10:12 it's never more prevalent that day so
10:16 mental technologies well we always talk
10:22 about you know when you see something
10:24 that wakes you up you can't unsee it
10:26 right this is one of those big moments
10:30 for all of us this is something that I
10:32 wanted to get out really quick in the
10:34 episode in case you want to turn it off
10:35 you've never been on the episode before
10:36 you now have a weapon and it's the idea
10:41 and realization but this technology
10:44 exists for the brain anyone starts
10:47 throwing crap at you
10:48 global warming asteroids from space all
10:53 this stuff you can just look at them and
10:58 say well you know that's all just a
11:00 bunch of future predictions and you
11:02 can't live your life based off these
11:05 future predictions of which none of them
11:08 ever come true you know there's the
11:11 there's a moment I think in almost every
11:14 single human beings life definitely for
11:16 males because we're the protectors in
11:19 most cases maybe not in some of the
11:21 generations but my generation we're
11:24 supposed to be
11:25 and you know your ear to look around and
11:28 protect and see who's gonna be who's
11:31 gotta you know loose cannon somewhere or
11:33 they're not operating on all cylinders
11:36 you know so as you become a man you
11:39 start to enhance this meter this sensor
11:44 and you start getting a little too much
11:47 in the oh my god this might happen that
11:50 might happen that might happen but it
11:52 almost instantaneously in the same ten
11:55 minutes of your life when you start to
11:56 get to that point where you know you
11:59 start to feel a little chaotic in your
12:01 head you immediately go yeah you know
12:02 what I can't live my life like I'm gonna
12:06 die by everything that I do you want to
12:10 live each day like it's your last I
12:12 think and that's one thing Steve Jobs
12:15 talked about that way you just get ever
12:18 get more of what you want you know but
12:21 you cannot you know just operate in fear
12:25 constantly of future things that could
12:28 take place when you have children bored
12:31 of a inc that stuff out of you in a
12:32 heartbeat you know you could you could
12:36 get the first car and then just drives
12:38 away from the house and you're like oh
12:39 my god is my kid gonna come back okay
12:42 then you forget that they have your DNA
12:45 they're fine but random stuff does
12:48 happen every once in while one of us
12:50 takes a hit it's a very sad thing which
12:53 is why you do want to you want to
12:55 casually you know fill your kid with as
12:58 much wisdom for yourself with as much
12:59 wisdom which is which is knowledge
13:02 experienced right I have a whole episode
13:05 on it right just look up wisdom on deep
13:07 thoughts radio calm in the search field
13:10 Prince I mentioned him a lot late I
13:13 don't know why I'm going to listen to
13:14 him in my house or anything yeah
13:17 paintings I did of him in my wall but he
13:19 had a really funny scene in his movie
13:21 under the cherry moon where he was
13:23 hanging out with Mary the woman he
13:25 wanted to woo and she had been a rich
13:29 girl in southern France it's a fictional
13:31 character he's playing a fictional
13:33 gigolo with his other buddy Jerome from
13:35 the time who's also playing a gigolo
13:38 prince is kind of a high-end gigolo
13:39 because he can play the piano and Jerome
13:41 kind of lines him up for him
13:43 takes whatever's left that's the
13:44 character breakdown anyway but they went
13:47 to this restaurant called LaBelle viola
13:48 and she's trying to kind of show them
13:51 her side of the game almost challenging
13:54 him let's see how you can exist in my
13:56 world which is kind of silly because he
13:58 was in her world the whole time playing
14:00 beautiful high-end nightclubs and
14:02 southern France but he shows up with his
14:05 short hair for the first time we've
14:07 never seen him with shorter tuxedo and
14:10 they are having a dinner and they're
14:14 having this debate about knowledge the
14:15 value of knowledge and prints so maybe
14:20 you know what do you know from knowledge
14:21 and he keeps saying you ever been to
14:24 Miami drunkies going I have just the
14:28 banter between these two guys in that
14:29 movie was priceless man never to be
14:32 recreated I swear to God but he gives
14:35 her a challenge he says um I'm gonna
14:37 write something down uses ghusl habla
14:40 Volk rail and he writes down this phrase
14:45 it says reqest oh and it smell really
14:48 weird and he goes here what is this say
14:54 this say it say it so say this out loud
14:56 right and she goes no it's ridiculous
14:59 it's nothing we'll say it out loud
15:02 ruckus to-- and they start laughing
15:04 really hard and he goes you don't know
15:07 what it is do you because you you know
15:11 you have to ask permission to leave your
15:12 house man it goes here say it again and
15:15 say it's so loud that everybody can hear
15:16 you and she's just she's young she's 21
15:19 like the actress is probably nearly 30
15:22 but she screams out loud rekka style
15:25 rekha style she uses she goes well what
15:29 is it and he says he leans into her and
15:32 he goes if he had to buy a Sam Cooke out
15:35 him where would you go and Jerome and
15:37 him just there just waiting to burst out
15:39 laughing and she says the record store
15:41 and they just [ __ ] die laughing and
15:44 it really was this beautiful little
15:46 metaphor of what you learned from
15:48 knowledge versus
15:51 and that's a tool to fight future
15:54 prediction you know a sheepdog herding
16:00 we can't let these people take away
16:03 everything we have worked our entire
16:06 civilization is technology of the mind
16:15 neil degrasse tyson he launched this
16:21 huge bold-faced lie about how Mars used
16:24 to have oceans and it was totally
16:26 civilized with an alien race but they
16:28 drove too many SUVs and the whole place
16:30 turned into what it is now being a bunch
16:34 of pictures generated in a computer or
16:35 taken in Greenland or other places in
16:38 the world pond office photographs from
16:40 some you know Rover that lasted 18 years
16:44 longer than it was supposed to or 17
16:45 years longer than supposed to by 18 by
16:47 now absolutely ridiculous but he wants
16:51 to scare you just like a preacher right
16:55 what's a preacher do just tell me Jesus
16:58 Christ episode
17:00 well preacher is there to scare you that
17:03 you might go to hell in the future so
17:06 you better give it up to him give him
17:07 your kids right Joe Biden should have
17:09 been a preacher man he would have been a
17:10 happiest pedophile on planet earth man
17:13 do you imagine all the pedophiles and
17:15 the Democratic Party becoming a church
17:18 who wouldn't be in the game whether you
17:22 realize it or not there's a coup going
17:25 on in the United States of America and
17:27 it's the globalist Democrats fighting
17:30 sort of these taken off-guard
17:32 Republicans that are like Jesus is this
17:34 really going on now we got all these
17:37 morons that got elected plus all these
17:40 shields that have been there forever
17:42 it's a big deal as Cuse said I think
17:47 quite accurately if America Falls the
17:49 world Falls now before that dude ever
17:52 hit the airwaves I did in my gun control
17:54 episode if America loses its guns you
17:59 are [ __ ] if you don't live in America
18:01 and even if you do live in America
18:03 it won't happen okay it won't happen
18:07 though in gameplay that they would have
18:10 to do - the satellite apocalypse
18:13 technology I just talked about which
18:14 means you have to control basically the
18:17 entire government first and then you can
18:19 do whatever the hell you want down below
18:20 but still it'd be a [ __ ] bloodbath
18:22 and I don't think too many cops or
18:24 soldiers we doing anything but fighting
18:28 on our side and be a really quick short
18:30 battle but if they ever came for
18:33 America's guns it would be a bloodbath
18:35 and we would lock this place up so
18:37 [ __ ] tight you wouldn't be able to
18:38 get in we really euphoric in North Korea
18:41 with freedom inside and no one's allowed
18:44 in no one would be allowed in and all
18:50 those fields would be hanging their
18:52 heads would be on [ __ ] spikes man
18:54 every single one of them so it's
18:58 important that we don't lose control of
19:00 ourselves by allowing this stuff to mess
19:03 with our minds what stats to get every
19:06 every year no what was it every day
19:10 excuse me
19:10 sixty million dollars I don't know if
19:13 that includes Jack Parsons laboratory
19:16 but I don't think it does I think they
19:20 get their own budget this whole thing of
19:24 this hundred year war that Tony
19:27 Rockefeller told and Rizzo who then told
19:30 us through a little fifty minute
19:32 interview in the hospital when he was
19:34 dying of stomach cancer Alex Jones went
19:36 in and probably did the best interview
19:37 Alex Jones has ever done mainly because
19:39 he didn't say much which I appreciate
19:44 what you're supposed to do an interview
19:46 but he told us there would be a war for
19:48 a hundred years with a faceless enemy
19:51 which was first al Qaeda and then it was
19:54 Isis and now we're not fighting either
19:56 one of those groups and now we're no
19:59 longer you know electing or allowing
20:03 people to throw the votes through voting
20:04 machines to give us presidents that are
20:07 creating this turmoil in the first place
20:09 and it's both sides up until Trump it
20:14 was both sides
20:16 it's funny with with Trump night this
20:19 isn't gonna be a Trump episode by any
20:21 stretch but I think it's funny that when
20:23 he got into office you know my family
20:25 members and friends are all he's gonna
20:28 start World War three you know Hillary
20:29 Clinton was gonna put a no-fly zone over
20:31 Syria which is a declaration of war
20:33 Syria backed up by Iran and Russia she
20:38 was gonna start World War three on the
20:39 first [ __ ] day this dude has now
20:41 pulled everything out and yeah we're
20:43 putting a few more troops in Iraq right
20:45 now it's just a just one replacement
20:48 folks were rotating out who did get
20:50 injured from those missiles but it's
20:52 just a bolster just in case right you
20:54 don't want to be caught with your pants
20:55 down in case Iran does this big you like
20:57 ground strike which they won't
20:59 they're running people are beautiful
21:02 people I mean they really really are
21:05 amazing friendly people are they're
21:08 criminals well sure the Ayatollah is
21:11 this fake religious leader and then that
21:14 sulemani guy was the actual president it
21:16 was a military general well Salman he's
21:20 dead I'm sure if he gets replaced by
21:23 anyone that person will be dead
21:24 well Toula well he's just gotta keep up
21:27 appearances he's gonna say a bunch of
21:29 [ __ ] but the people don't follow any
21:32 of that they don't they keep their mouth
21:34 shut because they don't to be killed but
21:37 you know they've killed over 3,000
21:38 protesters in last 12 months they've
21:41 been riding for two years over there
21:42 trying to get rid of all that crap so
21:47 got what I find interesting is that
21:49 people that typically tell the truth
21:51 they don't do this future future lifing
21:57 but almost unanimously the folks that do
22:01 take your money forever future lies and
22:08 sometimes my god we've got sort of this
22:12 subdermal lie thing that goes on at the
22:16 same time which is and this is gonna
22:19 sound very unpopular and and and
22:21 something you're gonna go yeah he
22:23 finally said it and some are gonna go
22:24 what
22:27 when things like aids came out which
22:30 again the virologists of the world have
22:35 been asking for one scientific paper
22:36 that links this HIV virus to this other
22:39 thing called AIDS and there's not a
22:41 single paper in the world that links the
22:42 two together at all
22:44 there's nothing when you have a t-cell
22:47 immune deficiency problem you die of one
22:49 of 43 normal sicknesses they just call
22:53 it AIDS right it's mainly caused by the
22:56 abuse of drugs or malnutrition either
23:00 one but once the AIDS thing came up I
23:03 want you to take all of the money that
23:07 Apple Computer alone has made selling
23:09 red ipods and read this and read that on
23:12 the back of the AIDS virus hmm why but
23:18 they love AIDS season when it comes
23:20 around right they make a [ __ ] ton of
23:22 money on that month or whatever and they
23:26 hold back the color red can't have red
23:28 ever unless you buy an AIDS red thing
23:31 Wow well so what happens when we cure
23:34 AIDS what's gonna happen do you never
23:36 get a red thing anymore the other one
23:39 that's driving me nuts and it's it's
23:41 sort of one of these bittersweet things
23:43 it's really strange I love all animals
23:48 in my later years I've just learned how
23:50 to fall in love with dogs on a level I
23:52 never thought I would ever be so
23:56 captivated I never disliked dogs there's
23:58 some mean ones everyone smile but I
23:59 never dislike all dogs cuz what I mean
24:02 but my father was not a pet guy when I
24:06 was young he kinda like cast we didn't
24:08 like dogs and then later he loves all
24:10 animals like he's been three decades
24:12 into loving all animals he has a bird
24:13 now I think but I just in interacting
24:17 with dogs have just fallen absolutely in
24:19 love with them I'm allergic to them I'm
24:22 allergic enough there would be an issue
24:24 and I have to take something every day
24:25 and I don't want to put a synthetic in
24:27 my body maybe in my lifetime they'll
24:30 cure that but there's this whole thing
24:33 about rescuing animals okay I'm not
24:38 saying don't
24:39 you an animal by God I mean I watch we
24:41 watch videos in the lounge everyone saw
24:43 will go on these marathons where people
24:44 pick up these dogs that are and cats and
24:47 everything that are messed up and they
24:48 totally love these things back into life
24:50 and it's the most beautiful enchanting
24:53 stories but these veterinarians are
24:54 [ __ ] robbing new people blind blind
24:58 you know the bills are so outrageously
25:02 arbitrarily created at veterinarians my
25:05 uncle's a veterinarian to just you know
25:07 vetti if you can test the bills
25:09 sometimes they'll knock an eight hundred
25:10 dollar bill down to four hundred dollars
25:12 just because you said that's too goddamn
25:14 much money oh okay half price like oh so
25:19 this really is a ridiculous bunch of
25:21 crap my friend in LA she had a cat that
25:26 stopped eating and she was really
25:28 worried about gonna start losing weight
25:30 but it was not that old like four and a
25:31 half years old she's like what the hell
25:32 it had got an affected tooth and because
25:35 it hurt to eat she didn't eat and so I
25:38 took her and her cat to the veterinarian
25:41 we went off got some dinner came back or
25:43 lunch or whatever they went at 850 bucks
25:46 to pull a tooth really really $850 what
25:52 did you do man did you give it you know
25:54 on a teeny amela tonnato more something
25:57 right she contested it and immediately
25:59 knocked it down by half sometimes these
26:01 animals have a lot of issues and they
26:03 just keep you know the old neuter it for
26:05 free sometimes they won't take care of
26:07 all the problems you come back and it's
26:08 1,000 2,000 3,000 my buddy Bobby
26:10 blotters dog died of spontaneous cancer
26:14 at the exact same time that Chinese food
26:16 was coming over it was locked down for
26:19 killing a bunch of animals they dropped
26:21 eight grand on this dog in a month
26:24 because everyone loved Jack and it was
26:27 just sudden he had at least two to four
26:29 years more of life and he just shut down
26:32 he was a sweetest thing on planet Earth
26:36 so his games being played constantly to
26:38 take advantage of us
26:40 and this future Lai thing is starting to
26:42 get ridiculous right having to listen to
26:46 this [ __ ] kid Greta
26:52 it's so unbelievable one Europe is the
26:58 rocket engine under these chicks button
27:00 right Europe is the place you see Greta
27:03 all the time all the time Oh Greta Greta
27:05 Greta the little chick should be in
27:08 school she's not in school you can tell
27:11 she hasn't had much education she can
27:14 only read from a script when she was
27:17 asked at a panel one time to elaborate
27:18 on one of her lies
27:20 and she can't believe everything I don't
27:23 think she's that intelligent I'd love to
27:25 see her go through a Mensa test I see
27:27 her come up flat zeros men I loved it
27:31 I'd love to give her an intelligence
27:32 test on nothing but global warming and
27:34 meteorology technology and see how bad
27:37 she fails and say oh and you're the
27:38 [ __ ] authority running around foe
27:41 crying you think everyone's buying it
27:44 because George Soros is paying for your
27:46 flights your huge carbon footprint
27:48 flights everywhere private planes and
27:51 you're dumb you're strictly stupid okay
27:58 but Al Gore makes a movie 2006 December
28:02 it's released I watched it I actually
28:04 believed it cuz I didn't have any
28:05 knowledge on this stuff yet didn't take
28:08 long before other documentaries came out
28:11 by experts that founded the IPCC which
28:14 is the group that was founded to track
28:16 down and make all this real but they
28:18 said this is all [ __ ] I told you
28:22 that several times it's a great global
28:23 warming swindle you need to watch now
28:26 you have to know that when you see that
28:27 movie there was a surge in heat and in
28:30 the world in 2003 the due to sunspots
28:33 and they cover this if they
28:37 categorically deny anything that Al Gore
28:39 said Al Gore's reverse hockey stick
28:44 theory was also dismissed in the science
28:46 community before he released the movie
28:48 but of course they try to quash that and
28:51 what did they give him an Oscar a Grammy
28:52 and Nobel Prize I mean it was just all
28:55 set up once they gave Obama the Peace
28:58 Prize to Nobel Peace Prize but the first
29:02 week he was in office how do you get
29:05 something for some
29:05 you've never even dealt with before
29:09 unbelievable right but this dude the
29:12 funniest thing was in his simulation of
29:16 what the world was gonna be like in four
29:17 years the sea levels were gonna rise ten
29:20 feet okay ten feet montecito went
29:28 underwater in his movie little coastal
29:31 region here in California well it hasn't
29:34 risen jack [ __ ]
29:36 and guess who bought a house with the
29:39 money he made off of all of his shilling
29:42 Al Gore he bought a house in Montecito
29:45 it's one of his dozen houses that he
29:49 owns that racks up a $40,000 a month
29:53 electrical bill between all of his homes
29:55 this guy is probably one of the biggest
29:58 carbon footprints of a non upper class
30:02 citizen hmm but what's going on now how
30:07 do they fight the war of the future line
30:10 now here's the thing let's say the
30:14 future lies that in three days time two
30:19 plus two is going to equal five all of a
30:20 sudden and you're like really
30:24 yeah oh why is that well the universe is
30:26 gonna change and upside down backwards
30:28 quantum physics thing bla bla gravity
30:31 wave and you're like well I don't know
30:32 anything about that well if that's
30:34 [ __ ] weird really to you start
30:36 spreading that around so you find one of
30:38 your mathematician friends and you tell
30:41 them and they're like what now dude two
30:44 plus two is always gonna equal 4 will
30:45 never equal 5 are you talking about and
30:48 then three days passes and sure enough
30:51 you do your calculator and two plus two
30:53 equals four
30:53 but these crazy [ __ ] agenda21 people
30:59 which is what everything in the world is
31:02 underneath you need to research it Rosa
31:05 Cory Baro si ko aye
31:09 ar e
31:12 she's an expert on it she's a trump
31:15 supporter who's a libertarian and a
31:17 lesbian right if you were to just total
31:20 up her demographics and say is that
31:23 person a trump supporter who would say
31:25 hell no but yes what she is she cuz
31:29 she's been fighting it on a legal level
31:31 with the organization she created and
31:33 she's seeing the president United States
31:34 kill everything that agenda21 was doing
31:37 to America she's also very much aware
31:40 that Barack Obama was trying to hand it
31:43 over and that Hillary Clinton was
31:45 basically the spiked slam dunk on agenda
31:48 21 destroying this country but what
31:52 happens after this 2+2 still equals four
31:54 in three days is that okay all the press
31:58 in the world from Reuters ap same
32:01 company owned by the Rothschilds all of
32:03 the news organizations that are liberal
32:05 you know and Fox you know you just play
32:08 in this game it's a money game
32:11 individuals on Fox I think are very
32:13 awake and not they're never gonna
32:15 they're never gonna waver but they're
32:18 whoever writes their articles that are
32:20 not linked to the personalities they're
32:22 the Schiele guys that put one in every
32:24 once in a while right but they keep
32:27 saying from this point forward two plus
32:30 two does equal five like wait this is
32:34 nuts I can do my own math and it doesn't
32:38 equal five I get four chopsticks to two
32:44 it equals four when I count him up it
32:46 equals 4 no it equals five
32:48 obviously ripping this off from 1984 by
32:52 George Orwell how many lights DC and
32:54 Star Trek which I think it was David
32:59 Warner playing a Kardashian and he was
33:04 torturing jean-luc Picard there are four
33:09 lights but they keep repeating and
33:14 repeating and repeating the lie and
33:17 eventually the week
33:20 give up let me say okay okay fine
33:24 and what was beautiful in the Star Trek
33:26 episode is what happened with you guys
33:29 don't watch Star Trek is that jean-luc
33:31 Picard the captain of the first reboot
33:33 the next generation is captured by these
33:36 lizard guys and he is forced to look at
33:41 four lights and say it's five you won't
33:42 do it so they torture and and starve him
33:46 to death and hang him by his body I mean
33:50 like they literally did a cross sex
33:52 crucifixion on the guy and eventually
33:56 the good guys find out where he is and
33:59 they make a demand we know you got our
34:00 guy given to us and he is just Picard
34:04 you know or is it Patrick Stewart played
34:07 this this role this particular episode
34:10 especially so believable I mean how
34:13 destroyed he was as a human being and he
34:16 turns around last second and screams it
34:18 in his face I'm not gonna concede to
34:21 your [ __ ] and then has to be every
34:24 single one of us that wants to protect
34:26 our way of life you know what's really
34:29 fascinating about this whole sort of
34:33 globalism agenda21 thing and again I
34:37 don't know what happened to the IQs in
34:38 Europe they are waking up like crazy
34:40 France is having massive protests in
34:44 Paris Britain just woke up and walked
34:46 the hell away from the European Union
34:49 but I don't know about all these pro EU
34:53 folks he's Pro agenda21 folks I don't
34:55 know what the virus is crawled into
34:58 their brain to make them feel like this
35:00 is a good idea I don't know what the
35:02 pitch is that makes them believe that
35:04 they're not that they're actually on a
35:06 list that's going to give all the
35:07 benefits of life right from this thing
35:09 but what's fascinating is what I can
35:13 tell you unequivocally is the freedom
35:15 that you have today whatever that means
35:19 to you getting up in the morning when
35:21 you want to being able to change jobs
35:23 being able to buy a car if you could
35:25 afford it being able to dress and
35:27 clothes that express your the pains
35:29 being able to have hair have hair how
35:31 you like it wear sunglasses the wheel
35:33 in the middle of the backyard at 2:00 in
35:35 the morning smoking a cigar making a
35:37 YouTube video that kind of freedom once
35:42 agenda21
35:43 gets its way I think I could probably
35:47 safely estimate 80% of every single
35:51 thing that you recognizes freedom if not
35:54 95% is a fleeting memory of a generation
35:58 that is the first generation to get put
36:01 into these concentration camps which are
36:03 these inner-city structures because the
36:06 rural areas of the world will be wiped
36:07 clean of all human beings and you will
36:12 be in a uniform you will have a
36:14 hairstyle for men hairstyle for women
36:17 thx 1 1 3 8 everyone was bald to create
36:19 a total fascist society so no one in VD
36:22 anyone else's stuff you will be
36:24 patrolled by robots like I've said
36:26 several times and you'll lose it all
36:29 your homes will be videotaped constantly
36:33 inside every room you take a [ __ ] they
36:36 got it on tape you have a conversation
36:38 with your kid your wife your husband
36:41 your friend it's all being recorded then
36:45 it's being transcribed just like a
36:47 YouTube video into text files but then a
36:49 very dumb AI computer looks for pattern
36:52 recognition and what you say it's not
36:54 it's not even remotely difficult to do
36:57 we've been doing it forever it's called
36:58 search engines we've had search engines
37:00 and databases forever right everything
37:06 that's underneath Google's hood I used
37:08 to do it professionally in the 90s
37:09 before the internet was HTTP protocol
37:12 and evil it's not a big deal man it's
37:15 all a big keyword search that's it now
37:19 you can add other AI on top of it to
37:22 enforce tyranny which we know happens
37:25 so NASA keeps buying these articles on
37:29 the front page of every single New
37:30 Zealanders including Fox because they
37:33 know it creates clickbait it creates ad
37:36 sales so they are willing to sell
37:37 articles it cost about 250 grand to buy
37:41 an article on the front page of any of
37:42 the dot-com websites in the world the
37:45 sell it and make it look like it
37:47 an impartial use thing I mean you know
37:51 what is it Jessica
37:55 what's-her-name the singer just bought a
37:58 little promo piece of you know why she
38:01 stopped drinking all these influence are
38:05 these mom influencers on Instagram well
38:08 the PR firm signs up buys the article
38:11 doesn't cost 250 for sure on that deal
38:13 but it's just filler they're buying the
38:15 bumpers buying the holes in their
38:16 newsfeed and they drive a bunch of
38:19 people to Instagram and then they get a
38:20 bunch of sponsorship and the PR firm
38:22 gets paid and the lady gets paid and it
38:24 just goes in a big circle
38:26 but NASA buys these you know asteroid
38:30 coming at Earth articles every quarter
38:32 at least every quarter but every year
38:35 though by the black hole's gonna swallow
38:38 up the universe thing but when is the
38:42 last time you ever heard now you can get
38:46 this in popular science a little bit in
38:48 scientific America but that's the only
38:51 place you get what I'm about to say it's
38:54 all fluff it's all words they
38:57 threatening us with an outside cosmic
39:00 event of which they have no ability to
39:03 stop at all at all at all at all if
39:08 there was a rock the size of Rhode
39:12 Island coming at Earth there's nothing
39:18 NASA can do about it but when's the last
39:20 time you ever heard of dance of
39:23 launching a rocket to even test this out
39:27 you know everyone's always fascinated by
39:30 nuclear weapons right well bunch of
39:32 nukes at it you know you're talking
39:34 about nothing touching this thing right
39:38 you could blow up you know a moderately
39:42 huge rock I mean if a rock was as big as
39:44 New York City their ability to actually
39:47 hit it and blow it up into little pieces
39:50 that's really tough because in space if
39:54 that's if it's exactly what they say it
39:56 is it's going to bounce off yeah you'll
39:59 you'll send you one side of it
40:01 changes trajectory but imagine it was
40:05 gonna land in the Atlantic Ocean it was
40:07 gonna add land in the middle of the
40:08 Pacific Ocean but I was gonna lane in
40:10 Kansas it's gonna land in Paris it's
40:13 gonna land in India Russia China because
40:18 they moved it wrong hmm that'd be great
40:22 wouldn't it they're lying about climate
40:26 change they know it's it's it was almost
40:31 like set up as a destiny for someone to
40:34 come in and pull a scam on climate
40:36 change because why because of what I
40:38 told you guys several times we [ __ ]
40:41 about the weather but we don't [ __ ]
40:43 about the weather because we really
40:44 terribly care about the weather we
40:47 talked about the weather be so we can
40:49 open up a dialogue with another human
40:51 being to get off of the weather
40:54 conversation and ask the chick for her
40:55 phone number
40:56 so maybe some destiny could happen
40:59 that's what that conversation was about
41:01 it's the water cooler conversation it's
41:04 what you can say to any human being on
41:06 planet earth to get something going but
41:10 now that usurped it it's the fuse that
41:14 gets into this other conversation which
41:15 is now you can not only have that
41:18 conversation but you can start virtue
41:20 signaling a bunch of horseshit because
41:21 you're a [ __ ] you don't study anything
41:24 about the atmosphere you don't study the
41:26 greenhouse gas layer index you know the
41:30 repetition repetition repetition with
41:33 NASA and Trump is just as guilty as
41:36 anyone Q was guilty of this they tell
41:42 you that they went to the moon no Q said
41:46 they did it was secret programs I mean
41:48 what a bunch of [ __ ] this guy pulled on
41:50 everybody I have an episode about it
41:52 called aq and on ly go see it he's lying
41:58 he's lying straight to his followers and
42:01 of course when I tell my friends who
42:03 know I know the signs about this thing
42:05 and they they're not equipped to refute
42:08 it and they also believe it as well deep
42:09 down inside and we'll say it in other
42:11 conversations but on that conversation
42:12 they'll say oh well you know Q sins
42:15 disinformation out there for people to
42:17 Oh Cal [ __ ] convenient is this
42:21 goddamn fictional character out there
42:23 when he's telling the truth it's like
42:25 it's like it literally some [ __ ] that
42:28 predicts the future every day predicts
42:31 the future
42:31 give me an earthquake today and then
42:34 some quake happens somewhere in their
42:36 world that's what I was talking about
42:36 but if no earthquake were to happen all
42:39 day well you know I don't always tell
42:41 you the truth it's you know I got to do
42:43 my ways well then you can [ __ ] win
42:45 every goddamn day don't you right it's
42:48 like it would be like having the the the
42:51 rules to American football be this to
42:56 score well you can either put it in the
42:59 touchdown zone to score six points or
43:03 you cannot get it in the touchdown zone
43:05 and still score six points either way
43:07 you're cueing on and you're always
43:10 scoring and you have all these people
43:11 saying how [ __ ] ingenious he is
43:13 because now he's posted so much gypsy
43:16 reading crap if they can just find you
43:19 know one of his other cue clock and all
43:21 this other [ __ ] really no one's going to
43:23 jail right you're telling me that the
43:26 impeachment trial is some ingenious
43:29 [ __ ] thing that we need some some
43:31 Oracle making cookies in a kitchen to
43:33 decipher I don't think so I don't think
43:37 so if there ever was a
43:39 shit-or-get-off-the-pot moment q and on
43:43 it's been in the toilet for a really
43:44 long time right there's a line out front
43:46 get the [ __ ] out of there dude you got
43:50 nothing to contribute to society
43:52 maybe you've waken a lot of awaking a
43:54 lot of people up but maybe we would have
43:56 already have awakened through other
43:57 means you have them anything profound
44:01 seriously you've predicted a few weird
44:03 little things because you're making
44:04 predictions every single day and
44:06 everything's so non-committal because of
44:09 top security reasons you know also the
44:11 crabs like yeah go back and study deep
44:14 throat from the days of Nixon not the
44:17 movie but the informant on the Watergate
44:20 investigation that was real insider
44:24 information that broke the case wide
44:26 open
44:27 that's queuing on [ __ ]
44:28 it's like I got a hide you know behind
44:32 this thing and oh my god just [ __ ] off
44:34 would you it's like Ricky Gervais said
44:37 thank your agent thank your God can get
44:40 the [ __ ] off the stage because he's
44:42 threatening you with the future - we
44:47 could handle a world without these you
44:49 know weird things going on in my opinion
44:54 the amount of people that fall for the
44:58 pride thing because NASA is this you
45:01 know American institution and it's
45:04 attached to these astronauts that got to
45:06 go to ticker tape parades and and
45:09 basically not do anything for the rest
45:11 of their lives to earn money because
45:13 they have a big fat pension and they're
45:15 obviously being taken care of because
45:17 they're holding down the lie I mean what
45:21 an interesting conversation with God
45:23 that just blows me away it's like you
45:27 know I think the only maybe rationale
45:31 you could have would be the astronaut
45:33 telling God you know well they were
45:35 gonna kill my family and I have truly as
45:37 a human being believed that and so in
45:39 order to keep my family alive
45:41 I kept the lie going that's about the
45:43 only thing I can imagine you can tell
45:45 your God but you know what your God's
45:46 gonna know if you really did believe
45:49 that or not it's 2020 men it's time to
45:54 throwdown it's 51 years later man it's
45:56 time to throwdown
45:57 yeah you know what I'm done with this
45:59 lie I'm not gonna be controlled anymore
46:01 I look in the mirror and I want to slice
46:03 my own throat open because I've been
46:05 lying to every single kid out there and
46:07 you know spare me the [ __ ] of
46:09 inspiring children the only thing that
46:11 these astronauts did in terms of
46:14 influencing children is to make sure
46:17 they never go back to the moon because
46:19 it's old grandpa thing to do every every
46:24 single accomplishment demands ever done
46:25 nobody wants to do it again man someone
46:28 else I'm trying to find something new
46:30 what can I do I'm gonna climb that rock
46:31 it's never been class someone just
46:32 clatter last week out [ __ ] that then
46:34 right that's how it goes the rules not
46:37 gonna flood and you know what's really
46:41 interesting is what
46:42 started this show I probably believed a
46:45 lot more information than I believe
46:47 right now
46:48 from the science community and since I
46:51 have awakened one connection at a time
46:54 especially the dinosaur thing man wow
46:56 what a duped goddamn thing I believed in
46:59 my whole life right and for anyone who
47:02 has an issue with this dinosaur thing
47:04 because you well I'll just say it this
47:06 way if you don't think the dinosaur if
47:10 you think the dinosaurs were real either
47:12 you've never done any research in it
47:14 which I fully respect but you've done
47:16 your research and then you still came
47:18 back to the conclusion that they exist I
47:20 imagine you were a dinosaur kid you had
47:23 the little toys and stuff or you watched
47:24 all the shows on TV that had them you
47:26 loved Jurassic Park and you don't want
47:28 anyone to piss on your pre and you know
47:30 what I don't really feel like I need to
47:31 piss on your parade if you kind of want
47:34 to believe in that that's cool there's
47:36 some chicken wisconsin that dresses up
47:38 like you know ninja turtle everyday she
47:40 doesn't bother me I think it's kind of
47:42 neat you know say hey if you can do it
47:43 and someone will pay all your bills
47:46 awesome it's great so I don't really
47:49 feel like you need did not believe in
47:50 dinosaurs but the one thing you can do
47:53 to convince yourself this is all
47:55 absolute [ __ ] is that the dude who
47:58 found the tooth the first thing they
48:01 said was a dinosaur if you look at the
48:05 dinosaur that he created in the museum
48:06 to show off the tooth it's pretty much
48:10 98% of Tyrannosaurus Rex it's not as big
48:13 as the trying to source Rex but it's the
48:15 same goofy ass body with small hands you
48:18 know when you take away all the supports
48:20 and you make it real and throw into a 3d
48:22 software it falls around on its face
48:23 breaks its neck because it just
48:26 geometrically doesn't match everything
48:29 else that exists on this planet I mean I
48:32 had a friend of mine who mistakenly
48:36 showed his cards and he wasn't trying to
48:38 be manipulative but he had seen so many
48:41 like Jurassic Park movies that he
48:43 actually thought that the little tiny
48:45 Velociraptor is actually a real being in
48:48 this world and we're all looking at him
48:52 in the room like really where do you
48:54 think you saw that man I
48:56 oh man I know I saw its opposite he
48:58 started fabricating a lie to cover it up
49:00 his own mind he was just literally
49:02 coming to terms of the fact that he was
49:03 taking fiction that was so beautifully
49:06 rendered by Industrial Light and Magic
49:07 that he actually thought it was a living
49:09 being that's how easy it is but we have
49:14 another little thing another layer on
49:16 top of so below the layer of Lies we
49:19 have the oh it's a puppy you know it's
49:22 like we're not do anything to curb
49:24 you know rampid population explosions
49:29 and animals we have the profit ears from
49:33 that you know phenomenon then we're not
49:36 doing anything about right I mean some
49:38 people are really honestly trying to fix
49:40 that problem and I those are the people
49:41 we need to fund you know I've got one
49:44 friend of mine tried to do that and he
49:46 ended up realizing it was a completely
49:47 fruitless game but then we have future
49:50 life but on top of that then we have
49:53 these trillionaire families that are now
49:58 trying to orchestrate the lie what do I
50:02 mean by that well weather manipulation
50:05 is extremely real extremely real by 1948
50:08 we were seeding clouds to rain in Kansas
50:12 there was an experiment so in the 1950s
50:15 and I this is my life what I'm about to
50:18 tell you sort of blows my own mind a
50:21 little bit when I was a kid my
50:23 grandmother owned this sort of
50:26 olive-green
50:26 a belief refrigerator and on the side of
50:33 refrigerator with a magnet on top of it
50:35 she had cut out an article of a bunch of
50:38 it's a picture of a bunch of biplanes
50:39 flying I think it's a nice shot if
50:42 however they did it must have hit it
50:44 with the light or something but it was a
50:45 bunch of biplanes and it was an article
50:47 about how they seeded the clouds and
50:49 Kansas in their mid-50s to make it rain
50:53 and she kept that on her refrigerator
50:56 forever and I'm you know I remember just
50:58 thinking well that's kind of neat and my
50:59 mother she was the schoolteacher so
51:05 I just looked at that article over and
51:06 and never moved man the entire time I
51:08 knew my grandmother at this particular
51:11 house I was only at her last house but I
51:14 mean I think she moved into there by
51:16 1980 or so it was on the side of a
51:20 refrigerator
51:22 and how I get to this point and I have
51:24 to argue with people in 2020 that we can
51:27 see clouds and make it rain they're not
51:31 willing to look it up in the annals of
51:33 time
51:34 it's fully documented man well we know
51:37 that they we know how to race clouds
51:39 because 400 grand you can make all the
51:40 clouds disappear over your wedding it's
51:42 a service you can buy China wiped all
51:46 the lace why just think I just heard it
51:48 was a reserves I think it's either three
51:52 or thirty million dollars came over the
51:53 expedition on that but they paid
51:56 millions and millions of dollars to
51:57 clear all the clouds out before the
52:00 Olympics happened in China they created
52:02 a monsoon just south of that which
52:05 killed something like 75 people so we're
52:10 not buying the climate change thing okay
52:14 so they start moving the Jetstream with
52:21 metric tons of this stuff it's
52:24 controlling the high pressure zones the
52:27 dein guy that does all the chemtrails
52:29 just look up da in e chemtrails you find
52:31 his website it's got a PhD
52:33 he's got worked on the solar panels on
52:35 its 2500 acres 2,600 acres up against
52:38 Mount Shasta he is proven by the by
52:42 scientific method it was six PhD
52:45 botanists that work for him the stuff
52:47 kills the soil kills the plants and
52:49 erases storms or creates them but
52:52 erasing them is even more intense
52:54 because she calls high pressure zones
52:56 that he has tracked since controls
52:59 really got underway in 97 I think
53:01 they've been around for about three
53:02 decades before that but he has tracked a
53:05 fact at the jet stream that normally
53:07 doesn't reach northern alaska is now all
53:12 the sudden wandering around northern
53:13 alaska keeping it between 34 and 32
53:17 degrees which is melt
53:19 temperatures Fahrenheit of course so
53:22 well over zero Celsius right so now
53:26 they're trying to create it if there's a
53:28 little tiny storm in the ocean well they
53:29 can just bomb that thing with the
53:31 seeding technology and blow it up then
53:34 they can do a racing technology to the
53:37 left or right of the hurricane spirit
53:40 like the one that came in when obama got
53:43 reelected again in Wikipedia and
53:45 Wikipedia if you read why Obama got
53:47 reelected they say in there because of
53:50 his courageous response to this
53:52 hurricane it nearly hit New York what a
53:55 [ __ ] joke go study where he was while
53:58 this thing was coming in you know that
54:00 the subtotal of his entire participation
54:03 was ignoring it for almost its entire
54:06 journey and I think going and visiting a
54:08 Weather Center for the last 36 hours of
54:11 its existence he did nothing
54:14 he didn't give an executive order he
54:16 didn't give any commands to do anything
54:18 it just didn't hit this at the coast but
54:23 if you look at the documentaries on
54:24 YouTube about it they give you all the
54:26 aerial photographs of this thing
54:27 traveling towards New York and you'll
54:29 see these unprecedented grids and lines
54:33 of chemtrails on both sides of the thing
54:36 making sure high pressure systems
54:38 directed this thing wherever the hell
54:40 they wanted it how do they try to get
54:42 rid of our guns a future lie the future
54:47 lie is that oh there's just going to be
54:48 more mass shootings more crisis actors
54:52 more mass shootings more crisis actors
54:54 more mass shootings so we need to take
54:56 away all the guns I read an article
55:00 about a week ago that I can't remember
55:02 where in the world it was but they're
55:04 starting to sell like snub-nosed knifes
55:07 now like the kind you had in cafeteria
55:10 when you were a kid it's like a
55:11 glorified butter knife so you can't stab
55:13 somebody no quite frankly I own a lot of
55:19 like normal kitchen knife some nice
55:21 German knifes and I can't I can't
55:25 actually say that there's a lot of need
55:27 for me to to use the point on the end of
55:30 a knife so maybe there's some logic to
55:32 that
55:33 but you know a machete usually has the
55:36 pretty round edge too and it's it's a
55:38 weapon of choice in South America and
55:40 Africa to chop a mofo up who's done
55:45 something wrong or just because this
55:47 guy's crazy and he's in a gas station
55:49 future predictions that never come true
55:53 what I think is fascinating about it is
55:55 is that the individuals that typically
55:59 try to scare you out of your guns as an
56:01 example are the kind of people that
56:05 actually have the evil hearts that would
56:07 take a gun and shoot their neighbor
56:09 shoot their wife shoot their husband
56:11 shoot their kids they're the people that
56:13 have the mental issue and typically it's
56:16 very apparent they have a lot of other
56:17 mental issues and your average Center to
56:22 slightly right person which is the
56:24 majority of America we don't even think
56:28 about you can have a complete knock-down
56:30 drag-out argument with your spouse or
56:32 with your kid or with your neighbor and
56:34 you don't you like I forgot I even own a
56:36 gun I forget oh yeah I got this thing oh
56:40 yeah cool you know sometimes I'll be in
56:44 bed it's funny because I have got I've
56:45 got raccoons and possums and cats and
56:48 stuff that roam around the backyard why
56:51 not it's the coolest place on earth
56:52 right but my bedroom window I was going
56:58 to bed and it was late it was by 4:00 in
57:02 the morning whatever and I heard this
57:05 pretty big animal assume it was a
57:08 raccoon or something moving against all
57:11 the vegetation right next to my windows
57:12 making a lot of noise and you know you
57:16 just you kind of sit in your ears perk
57:18 up but you know I'm like 98% sure it's
57:21 just an animal you know but you kind of
57:23 perk up and you're like okay let's just
57:25 make sure the animal goes by and what
57:27 you're listening for is any sound that
57:29 is your window moving right once you
57:32 hear that screeching noise of the
57:35 if the window thing well then you got a
57:37 human being trying to open a window then
57:39 you try to scare them away that's first
57:42 thing you want to do cuz you don't want
57:44 to get involved you know be like oh
57:45 great I'll get to shoot somebody today
57:47 you know no you clap your hands you yell
57:52 will you make it noise and then they'll
57:54 both take off they're not here to do
57:56 anything crazy unless they're completely
57:57 drugged out of their mind but California
58:00 thankfully has offenses between homes
58:04 what if they used to use when we were
58:06 kids me I'm showing you how systemic
58:09 this is and how long it's been in your
58:11 life what do they used to tell you if
58:12 you cross your eyes too much they'll get
58:16 stucked that way my grandfather used to
58:21 tell a funny one if you didn't eat the
58:23 crust of your bread you wouldn't know
58:25 how to whistle it's just funny man
58:28 and of course there's the the little one
58:33 for young men can only get a hairy palm
58:36 right we've been doing this for years
58:38 and what's sad about it is they just
58:42 advanced the algorithm up for sort of
58:44 these men child people don't you want to
58:49 be involved in something oh yeah you
58:52 know or do you stand for something I
58:54 don't think so well what if I told you
58:55 something you could stand for oh yeah
58:58 totally and ends up being a big joke I
59:03 mentioned the other day in an episode
59:05 but I forgot to really go through it
59:09 again it's a really short story but you
59:12 know we got a precursor at least in
59:14 Southern California of who was going to
59:18 be a gullible snowflake and it had to do
59:22 with this kony2012 [ __ ] right what
59:26 was that story wasn't Uganda some crazy
59:32 gorilla guys this is the story okay it
59:35 didn't none of this is true but they
59:37 went into a village and stole a bunch of
59:39 little girls out of a out of a grade
59:42 school and took them out into the woods
59:44 and there was you know raping them and
59:46 killing them
59:47 it was uh and then this kid from San
59:51 Diego gets somehow in the deep state
59:55 gets somehow under this agenda and runs
59:58 around telling everyone he needs to
60:00 raise money to go fight these guerrillas
60:03 okay first and foremost these rules are
60:05 bad asthma [ __ ] and no kid from
60:07 San Diego is gonna be able to do
60:08 anything to these folks it's either
60:11 gonna be a military operation or it's
60:12 not and the US government's either gonna
60:14 do it or they're not and they didn't but
60:18 the people went out there from Uganda
60:20 because they were like well we'll take
60:21 care of this [ __ ] ourselves man if they
60:24 go out there and they finally take a
60:25 picture of this group of people and all
60:27 these women maybe the youngest one was
60:29 twenty five but most of them were like
60:31 35 - God knows how old they were they
60:34 were grown women I guess what they're
60:37 all fully clothed and they're the de
60:40 facto partners of all the men in the in
60:42 the jungle no one's being held on and
60:45 you know against their will but now
60:47 here's the interesting thing to happen a
60:49 very good friend of mine had a
60:51 girlfriend and their relationship was
60:55 going great and she all the sudden got
61:02 on this kony2012 thing bought it hook
61:05 line and sinker not she been - you gonna
61:08 know does she know the guy from San
61:10 Diego no does she have any evidence
61:11 whatsoever this stuff was true no did
61:14 she do any research no what happens well
61:20 he finally just had enough of it he had
61:23 been tolerant of this stuff but he's a
61:25 genius and he's a researcher so he went
61:27 off and found the evidence and then
61:29 showed it to her and said look I don't
61:31 think you need to worry about this I
61:33 think maybe the kids pulling a scam he's
61:35 made millions of dollars he's gonna keep
61:37 so just you know let's maybe not focus
61:41 on it so much she breaks up with him
61:45 because she believes it so much she has
61:47 found her cause in life and aside from
61:49 kony2012 her cause would have been her
61:52 life boy you can't have that as an
61:55 agenda can you because when you have no
61:57 answers on how to live your life it's a
61:59 scary paradigm right
62:02 so she breaks up with him he's sort of
62:06 you know bums cuz he's like well
62:08 everything else was great I don't know
62:09 what the hell the deal is here but okay
62:11 I don't want to be dating crazy
62:13 definitely I want to get crazy pregnant
62:15 and so within 30 days of her throwing
62:19 down to him how stupid he was and
62:21 da-da-da-da-da in research nothing no
62:24 everything typical Democrat right it's
62:27 just the archetype of a Democrat how
62:29 could you possibly be one without with a
62:31 capability of researching anything right
62:34 and having cognitive reality be your
62:36 quality in life right Joe Biden is a
62:40 complete kid touching pedophile a quid
62:43 pro quo liar you know his whole family
62:47 is but he's a candidate for presidency
62:49 give me a break and no one's saying
62:51 anything about this guy's record okay
62:53 but less than 30 days after she broke up
62:55 with him the kid ends up who started
62:58 this movement in San Diego buck-naked
62:59 crazy as a [ __ ] you know I don't know
63:03 crazy [ __ ]
63:04 running around naked on a corner at
63:08 broad daylight you never saw that guy
63:11 again he is going off to face the plane
63:14 but consequently was at Barack Obama's
63:18 aunt who said that she was holding the
63:20 leg of his mother when he came out of
63:22 her in Kenya also ended up disappearing
63:25 for 45 days in Boston area believed and
63:28 she ended up in the exact same mental
63:31 state half-naked roaming around her
63:35 street screaming at everybody
63:37 interesting right
63:38 she says that she disappears she comes
63:40 out in kilcher right and I'll tell you a
63:43 little secret I had a good friend of
63:45 mine who actually met through in caelo
63:48 show that's just a listener when she's a
63:52 sweetheart but she lives in Arkansas
63:56 women apparently don't have that many
63:58 rights and she was in a dispute with her
64:04 husband at the time she had pretty
64:06 compelling evidence that the guy was
64:08 touching the kids and
64:12 pretty horrific when she told me what
64:14 her little daughter said about all this
64:15 information she had about sex and the
64:17 kids like barely old enough to speak
64:19 okay he managed to call the cops on her
64:22 she comes home and the kids got physical
64:26 issues downstairs she has she seems to
64:28 be on drugs because she's aligned with
64:31 it she's three she's talking about how
64:34 the kid the husband's fought mother gave
64:36 the kids some drugs and like she didn't
64:38 know what it was because she's a kid she
64:40 and she seems all messed up so she calls
64:42 the cops and says I need you over here
64:44 because I need you to look at my kid
64:45 before she Sobers up and I need you to
64:47 witness certain things she's been saying
64:50 so she goes off and takes a shower you
64:53 know that's what you have to do when
64:54 you're a single parent because they kind
64:55 of separated at the time so the police
64:57 show up and charge her with criminal
65:01 negligence of a child because she took a
65:03 shower at the same time that her kid was
65:05 in the house as if that's not allowed
65:08 utter crazy so she then blows a gasket
65:13 she's already really tired she's been
65:16 working you know just just to kind of
65:18 got out on her own she's struck as her
65:20 kids messed up and she gets more furious
65:23 the more that they're not focusing on
65:24 her kid because she's like my kid may
65:27 not remember this tomorrow so you need
65:29 to talk to her right they commit her to
65:33 a mental institution instantaneously
65:36 they don't throw her in prison or jail
65:38 because she seems you know she's pissed
65:42 they then proceed just like a crazy
65:45 nightmare you know movie to eventually
65:51 give her shock treatment I mean I didn't
65:54 know this stuff still existed but we're
65:57 talking about you know lathering up your
66:00 temples
66:00 putting the electrodes on putting a bit
66:03 in your mouth so you don't bite your
66:04 tongue and popping her and she has no
66:09 idea how many times they did it because
66:11 her brain gets absolutely erased all the
66:13 neural patterns and neural information
66:16 in your mind all those little electrons
66:17 that make you who you are make you
66:19 remember where you are and all that
66:20 stuff gets erased that's why it was
66:24 invented in the first place because it
66:25 would cause
66:25 down a crazy person they would
66:28 eventually metabolize backup usually but
66:33 then they they did this other thing
66:35 which was just as egregious I mean she
66:37 should be able to sue this place for
66:38 millions of dollars they threw her out
66:42 of the hospital within you know a couple
66:46 days of doing this to her for several
66:47 weeks
66:48 so she no longer has her identity
66:52 completely she's got a bit of like
66:54 temporary amnesia because of this this
66:57 shock treatment when she called me up
67:01 you know several times and what was
67:05 happening I mean this was I heard this
67:08 on the telephone and she is perfectly
67:09 fine today she's she's really just I
67:12 mean if she became a country singer you
67:15 would see your movie on TV we're waiting
67:18 for the happy happy ending and then
67:20 she's got a movie just ready to go but
67:23 she would be on the phone with me and
67:24 she would be crying a little bit
67:26 she's a very strong person so for her to
67:28 have any tears or vulnerability in her
67:31 voice it's not normal but I heard this
67:35 on the phone several and I told her you
67:37 call me anytime you need me okay but
67:40 she's fine we're talking I'm I'm pep
67:43 talk on her like crazy I'm orienting her
67:45 life I'm talking about how she's okay
67:47 and she's stable now and unfortunately
67:49 your mother was a drug addict and her
67:51 mother's partner was another lady it was
67:54 even a worse drug addict so she had no
67:55 place to go but this horrible house with
67:57 all this drugs and so she be talking to
68:02 me we did Skype every once in a while
68:04 but mostly it was on the phone when I
68:05 heard this craziness and she would start
68:08 she'd be fine and then all of a sudden
68:11 the reset frequency would come back I'm
68:16 not sure why this happened if there's a
68:18 pocket in her mind that did this and she
68:20 would start stuttering and then she
68:22 would start saying you know mark I have
68:24 to get off the phone I have to get off
68:25 the phone and a few times I said stay on
68:27 with me just do whatever you got to do
68:29 and she was so embarrassed that she had
68:31 no control over her body in her mind
68:32 that she'd hang up on me half the time
68:36 but one time a couple times I was just
68:39 driving
68:39 my car came back from LA for my startup
68:41 and I'm driving down the street
68:45 listening to one of the most horrific
68:47 experiences that someone else has had
68:49 without being really physically being
68:51 beaten or damaged straight but she'd
68:56 have to scream every once it was like a
68:57 little I was like a mix of everything
68:59 like Tourette's and all this other stuff
69:00 right but not really seeing anything
69:02 coherent and so when I see these these
69:06 weird kids like these Greta's thumb
69:09 Berg's it's like I don't know that kids
69:13 just [ __ ] genetically messed up but
69:15 you know the the links that the deep
69:21 state will go to to get their way is
69:23 insane now that was just a little
69:25 personal situation it is since it's
69:28 taking two years to get everything back
69:29 on track and she's completely on track
69:31 and got our life together but uh you
69:37 know when you hear these things
69:38 experience these things firsthand you
69:41 start to understand just the minor tools
69:44 that will that can be used to create
69:48 fake evidence towards these lies right
69:51 there was that famous marine I'm
69:56 thinking it's 12 to 15 years ago some of
69:59 you remember this story I can't remember
70:00 the guys name but he he was I guess
70:04 posting online a bunch of truth' stuff
70:06 maybe was very focused he was an
70:08 ex-marine he was focused on 9/11 and so
70:12 he was posting a bunch of stuff about it
70:14 being an inside job and I don't know
70:16 what he was doing but he was digging
70:18 deep and he was touching the right
70:21 communities to cause problems for those
70:23 who did it and so he was rated in the
70:26 middle of the night and he's a big guy
70:31 and he didn't shoot you know didn't get
70:34 it crazy but they were dragging him out
70:35 of his house as it was told and the
70:38 neighbors were interviewed in one of the
70:39 videos I saw but he was screaming that
70:44 he knew it was an inside job and they're
70:46 literally coming to take him away
70:48 because he knows the truth and his
70:49 neighbors heard that might have saved
70:51 his life because he said
70:53 I believe I have this right but he said
70:56 that when he got into that holding cell
71:00 wherever the hell they took him he said
71:03 the dude that you see with Tim McVeigh
71:06 it was his little controller after the
71:08 Oklahoma City bombings there's that guy
71:10 I can't remember his name I think I've
71:12 ever known his name but they said he
71:14 said that that guy was in the room and
71:17 he said that dude said to him
71:18 point-blank I can make you think
71:22 anything I want you to think I can do
71:24 anything to your brain that I want to do
71:27 I can make you whoever I want to make
71:29 you and that was the most sobering thing
71:32 he ever heard because he believed it why
71:36 not so when you hear the retort that no
71:43 no no it's real well what about this
71:45 evidence is evidence well those are all
71:47 lies oh really
71:48 right you know how convenient that every
71:51 time you brought the truth you know
71:53 these people they deem it as a lie it's
71:58 like there's a second chapter to the
72:00 emperor has no clothes you know I
72:04 haven't had that story told to me in
72:06 probably 40 years but it seemed to me
72:10 that the story was that there's a parade
72:13 for the king and he comes out he has no
72:17 clothes on there's a guy or several
72:19 people behind him pretending to hold his
72:21 his tails right but they're not there
72:24 he's totally buck naked with his crown
72:26 on maybe he's holding the staff or
72:28 something right his scepter
72:30 and the little boy uh you know whatever
72:35 gender little kid says ma why doesn't he
72:38 have any clothes on and as I remember it
72:43 just vaguely in my brain the rest of the
72:46 people finally saw they didn't have
72:47 clothes on and they broke the cognitive
72:50 dissonance that was present in that time
72:56 but in this day there's a second second
72:59 chapter to the story the way it really
73:01 ends the the Grimm's brother tale if we
73:04 were to take it and make it a groom's
73:06 brother tale
73:07 is that all the adults look at the kid
73:09 and say of course he has his clothes on
73:11 and the kids like what you know and if
73:15 the kid protests one more time
73:17 well someone doesn't have a kid anymore
73:19 and the King eats him they'll be the
73:22 Grimm brothers ending to that whole
73:23 thing so here's what I want you to do
73:27 when you hear or well as to say there's
73:31 two halves to it right when you're doing
73:33 your research and you hear about a bunch
73:35 of future issues and I just did an
73:37 episode called satellite apocalypse
73:38 right that's why I said I don't want you
73:43 to think that I am trying to get you
73:45 freaked out I just want you to be aware
73:48 of a possibility right it's the same
73:51 sort of thing what I'm trying to do
73:52 whether or not I've missed successful or
73:53 not is up to you some people take it
73:55 probably one way some people take it the
73:57 other way but if I said you know if you
73:59 walk in front of the street and walk
74:00 into the street like Russians do without
74:03 looking both ways you probably have a
74:05 fairly high likelihood depending on the
74:06 time of day of being hit by a vehicle
74:09 which will take your life now I just
74:12 want you to look both ways when you get
74:14 to the edge of the curb left-right-left
74:15 something they don't teach Russian
74:17 people don't know why and then live
74:20 because you're cool I want you to live a
74:22 long time you know who knows what you're
74:24 gonna do with your life don't get killed
74:26 but I don't want you to wake up in the
74:27 morning go oh my god I might get hit by
74:29 a car that's not what I'm trying to do
74:31 right but as you take in information on
74:35 your own when you're by yourself reading
74:38 an article whatever give it this little
74:40 test is this a future line I mean are
74:45 you trying to scare me with what could
74:46 possibly take place because at some
74:48 point you know military and intelligence
74:51 agencies they look at what could
74:53 possibly happen all the time that's
74:54 their job
74:55 I guess what they do that you're not
74:57 encouraged to do with all the gullible
75:00 istic agenda21 crap which is climate
75:03 change and all that stuff depopulation
75:05 and all that stuff right they don't look
75:08 at the well the the professionals look
75:10 at the odds of the circumstances
75:12 occurring statistics and probability as
75:14 it factors into this potential thing
75:18 that could occur
75:19 Adam Schiff the piece of [ __ ] Adam
75:22 Schiff the boy touch your outer shift
75:26 right he went up and during the
75:29 impeachment trial and he barked out this
75:33 propaganda that we this old 1950s
75:37 rhetoric of how we have to hate Russia
75:40 how Putin can will only ever be a demon
75:44 in his eyes and how how Russia is just
75:47 right around the corner from invading
75:49 and a land invasion America in so many
75:52 insinuated words in a two-hour diatribe
75:55 in front of the Senate future threat
76:00 future lie so when you ingest stuff of
76:06 your own or have to hear someone else
76:10 pitching it to you because they're
76:12 trying to control you right again you
76:14 know religion is like the greatest
76:17 version of this ok the preacher says
76:20 you're gonna go to hell your friend says
76:23 you're gonna go to hell and if you were
76:25 to believe it the amount of apocalyptic
76:28 control they have over your life is sort
76:31 of absolute right okay what do I have to
76:34 do well kiss my ass for the rest of my
76:36 okay on kiss your hands very well is
76:38 what I do
76:38 well yeah any money I need at least 10%
76:41 me that's what God says right you know
76:43 Caesar doesn't exist anymore so I'm
76:45 gonna have to be paid because I have to
76:46 consult with you and how to save your
76:48 soul and that's gonna take away time
76:50 that I would spend saving other people's
76:51 okay okay I'll give you 20% I would be
76:54 doubly protected right it's that old
76:56 Dennis Miller joke he used to say in his
76:58 stand-up he read the National Enquirer
77:01 and there's an ad in the back about how
77:04 to avoid mail order scams send ten
77:08 dollars he says well honey I think I'll
77:12 send twenty dollars will be doubly
77:13 protected it's like this used to be
77:17 common sense man
77:19 a friend of mine did this radio
77:22 interview well I'm sorry it was like a
77:25 YouTube vlog interview but it was like
77:27 audio only and she was talking about how
77:30 America and the world seems to have lost
77:32 all common sense
77:35 and it's such a an abstract truth that I
77:40 want to do like an episode on it but I'm
77:43 not sure how I'd wrap my brain around
77:45 how to thematically explain that to
77:47 anyone because common sense is like this
77:49 it's like this thing you're supposed to
77:52 be born with or it's you born with a lot
77:54 of it and then your parents are supposed
77:56 to sort it out for you again wisdom is
77:59 common sense it's knowledge experienced
78:02 not just knowledge you know it was I'm
78:07 gonna bore you guys with a little story
78:08 of my own and again some of this is
78:11 rehash from the past but I'm sitting
78:14 here thinking about the metaphor of
78:17 wisdom and knowledge and there was this
78:19 moment in my life that really really
78:22 impacted me on so many different levels
78:25 I think you guys will get it and
78:27 probably telling it again will allow me
78:29 to tell it a little bit better when I
78:32 was a kid in fact this is common sense
78:35 and wisdom and knowledge all in one man
78:38 so I'm like eight years old and my my
78:42 dad's working two jobs he's got his
78:44 photography job and he's driving ups at
78:46 night my mom is working at a bank as a
78:48 teller at the time and so I was a you
78:52 know luck was they caught a what they
78:55 called the lucky child I figure up they
78:57 caught the thing where you just have
78:59 your latchkey child right so I'd come
79:01 home by myself you know school got out
79:03 three o'clock Kansas you started eight
79:05 goes to three get out of May 25th we
79:07 don't have school in summer and you know
79:11 I just get in the house and watch
79:13 cartoons feed myself a little bit
79:15 parents come home one two three and then
79:17 we're good all right well my mom puts me
79:21 in Cub Scouts which I don't know if you
79:23 Europeans have that stuff but it's the
79:25 precursor to Boy Scouts right same thing
79:28 but all the kids are really young they
79:30 don't really push this too hard on the
79:32 you know Wes Anderson Moonrise Kingdom
79:35 stuff and you know it was kind of cool I
79:38 got to hang out with some of my buddies
79:39 from school and all that good stuff but
79:42 the the common sense thing of that which
79:45 was really dumb was that I you
79:47 supposed to be with your dad it's
79:49 supposed to be a boy and his father and
79:50 your brothers if you have any and you go
79:52 into this thing and mom's got the girls
79:54 off of Girl Scouts or I forgot what they
79:56 call the younger Girl Scouts but
79:57 whatever and but there is a situation
80:00 that happens with this organization
80:04 where once a year they have this this
80:07 wood car ramp race competition so they
80:13 have this little tiny light it's like
80:14 maybe six feet ten feet maybe because
80:17 the curb it's ten feet they have like
80:19 four or five lanes and you take this
80:21 block of wood and you're supposed to cut
80:24 it up into a car and put it in these
80:25 tracks and then it just gravity takes it
80:27 down and one of you wins one of you
80:29 doesn't write rest of you don't write
80:31 and so this event comes around I get my
80:36 dad's you know working his ass off
80:37 whatever now I'm learning all kinds of
80:40 things from my dad like kind of build
80:41 TVs and race motorcycles and all the
80:43 good stuff so I'm definitely getting a
80:44 good dose of my dad all the weekends but
80:49 this car so they just give me this box
80:53 and the box has literally been printed
80:55 in the 50s no updates to it at all it's
80:58 supposed to look like kind of a cyber
80:59 van if you follow the schematic on the
81:02 outside of the box you just cut a little
81:04 bit off this thing nailing four tires
81:06 and you're good and I just still
81:10 remember to this day like it was like a
81:12 few days ago I'm in the I'm in the
81:15 garage with the [ __ ] power hacksaw
81:18 holding this block down and I'm just you
81:21 know cutting this [ __ ] off and my mom's
81:23 just kind of in the kitchen no problem
81:25 in gonna eat your ol with the electric
81:27 hacksaw I guess she just trust my IQ
81:29 tonight kill myself or a couple of
81:31 finger off I got an uncle that his
81:32 finger cut off free technically my
81:34 cousin cousin Larry and so you know the
81:38 family's gotta you know couple injuries
81:39 like that in there but I'm just out
81:41 there and remember my mom coming out and
81:43 going well you want macaroni and cheese
81:45 today or whatever I'm like yeah yeah I'm
81:48 cutting this thing up so I created as
81:51 close to an identical copy of what the
81:54 Box said and I painted this ugly-ass
81:58 green I think and I'm kneeling in the
82:01 tire
82:01 but here's the thing I have no idea what
82:05 this thing is used for I have no idea
82:07 that there's this race I have no I
82:09 no one ever said anything we're gonna do
82:10 this let me show you the the course and
82:13 stuff right so I think I'm making a car
82:16 just for appearances right and then it
82:20 comes the night that we're gonna go to
82:21 this event it's at this kind of Lodge at
82:25 this really cool park that we have in my
82:27 hometown in new Kansas and of course
82:29 everybody's there all the dads are there
82:32 just a few mom's there but I remember my
82:36 MOT the girls the women would just kind
82:37 of line up on the edge of the room kind
82:39 of looking us kids and a calculon going
82:42 my neighbor and one of my old neighbors
82:44 from a previous house was with his old
82:47 man but these gate these kids start
82:49 taking out their cars and it's painfully
82:53 obvious from the very GetGo their dad's
82:55 made their cars and their cars are
82:59 awesome looking I mean Jesus they have
83:01 cut away every single piece of wood that
83:04 doesn't need to exist in order to put
83:06 four tires on it and make it the proper
83:08 length right it's gotta be the length of
83:09 the block you can't cut it shorter right
83:11 but they had like you know spoilers on
83:14 the back made of this you know it's not
83:16 glued on it's like literally carved away
83:17 with flame you know paint jobs on it and
83:23 here I'm a little artist I would have
83:25 done all that stuff but I didn't think I
83:26 was allowed to do it so I see all these
83:30 tricked-out ass cars and I'm just I'm
83:33 look at this [ __ ] situation going you
83:35 know what this is [ __ ] I'm in this
83:38 I'm in this group where I'm supposed to
83:40 be with my old man he's working his ass
83:42 off now you put me in a group to just
83:45 reinforces the fact that my family's
83:47 kind of got screwed up thing going on on
83:50 one level least not a major level but
83:52 just you know what the hell and they put
83:55 all the cars in let him go little league
83:58 little gate it opens it up all these
84:00 other cars haul ass to the ground right
84:01 and I forgot who won mine just goes
84:05 halfway down it at the steepest point in
84:08 this ramp my front left tire is so
84:10 screwed up when I nailed it in because I
84:13 didn't know the race car
84:14 sticks and it just stays right there and
84:17 it's one of those life you know like you
84:20 just think dis a [ __ ] you know I just
84:22 look at this thing on
84:23 yeah I'm eight years old I just grew ten
84:27 years in one moment just looking at this
84:29 [ __ ] scenario that I've been stuffed
84:31 into where I'm using knowledge to create
84:34 a car not wisdom to create the car right
84:36 the contents of my parents that throw me
84:38 in this thing my mom should have told my
84:40 dad you got to help him at least know
84:42 what the hell he's doing you know maybe
84:44 you draw a little bit more on the block
84:46 about how to cut away the the wood and
84:48 then at least he'll do it himself sort
84:50 of thing but I don't know I don't think
84:52 my dad did Boy Scouts I mean if he did
84:55 he probably didn't have the car thing or
84:57 whatever I don't know I should ask my
84:59 old man if he ever did them little
85:02 vignette for you but this thing about
85:05 the future prediction thing it's just a
85:07 common-sense thing so if you hear it if
85:09 someone's trying to control you with
85:10 this [ __ ] narratives if you if your
85:13 big comment or on the web maybe you
85:14 throw it in there but let's start a
85:17 trend the stratagem was gone you don't
85:19 get to threaten me with my future you
85:21 don't you don't get to take away my guns
85:23 because you have a psychotic [ __ ]
85:25 mind and you can imagine all these you
85:27 know crazy events happening that none of
85:28 us are gonna engage in maybe maybe they
85:31 would if they got a gun but you're not
85:32 gonna do it they are actively
85:35 participating in weather manipulation to
85:37 try and create controlled cases in the
85:39 world where you feel like maybe this
85:45 climate change is occurring they give
85:47 you fake thermal data from water in the
85:49 ocean because all those buoys are owned
85:51 by the same organizations that are
85:52 pushing this [ __ ]
85:53 they're Kim trolling the crap out of
85:55 things causing crazy weather patterns
85:57 and record highs and record lows
85:59 meanwhile you're getting sick every time
86:01 you you know just this crap it's worth
86:06 99% of the world going away and you know
86:10 go check the Georgia Guidestones
86:12 remember that's 96 percent of the
86:15 population currently and then I couldn't
86:17 start at capacity so you half that and
86:19 you're at 99 percent ninety eight point
86:21 nine or whatever you're gonna get down
86:24 to five hundred fifty million people on
86:26 earth
86:27 200 max but not gonna want to deal with
86:30 this problem for a very long time so I'm
86:32 not going to go at five hundred million
86:33 five hundred millions 96.4 or some [ __ ]
86:35 of our current projected estimated
86:38 [ __ ] population number remember you
86:41 can fit a billion people in a building
86:44 that's one mile square so seven
86:46 buildings eight buildings so say what a
86:49 mile square you can barely see that [ __ ]
86:51 from space without a telescope so that's
86:55 how many human beings we have on planet
86:57 Earth and they're trying to tell you
86:58 we're overpopulated right they try to
87:01 tell you that we need a GMO is another
87:03 big future lie GMO sterilized as human
87:07 beings it rots your gut the two things
87:10 that blew up as the results of GMO
87:13 becoming more and more politican your
87:15 food this is America mainly 97% of our
87:18 shit's GMO [ __ ] Hawaii's all GMO how
87:21 sad is that
87:22 right all those pineapples from dole all
87:25 GMO man I know this because I research
87:28 the jobs over there and I listen to
87:30 interviews like oh yo we got a bunch of
87:31 GMO but everything's GM over here the
87:35 seeds don't replicate you're eating it
87:38 some immigrant makes it so that
87:40 infertility became a gigantic problem as
87:42 they snuck this [ __ ] into our food
87:44 supply they love vegetarianism right
87:48 because you eat more and more of that
87:50 crap sterilizing you so in vitro became
87:54 gigantic we have the Octomom and all
87:56 this other crap by the time we enter the
87:58 21st century people's guts were so
88:01 rotted out by this stuff destroying all
88:05 the tentacles in your upper intestine
88:07 that now probiotics are something that
88:09 people have to drink every single day
88:12 some people are so affected by this
88:13 stuff because they haven't changed their
88:15 diet that they have to drink this stuff
88:16 constantly again they're profiting off
88:19 their poison I just saw a video on
88:23 Facebook today where they're taking the
88:26 monster drink and mixing it with all
88:30 kinds of other things that you eat
88:31 normally and it's like it becomes
88:34 completely toxic in your body this guy's
88:37 I forgot what the hell he sprinkled on
88:39 like a
88:41 a fruit and then he poured stuff in it
88:46 so the monster on it and then it became
88:48 rubber he couldn't easily break the skin
88:51 anymore
88:51 he put it into a coffee mug with
88:53 something else and the coffee mug became
88:55 so weak it shattered just he could just
88:57 push on anything would blow up energy
89:00 drinks just so you know we're gonna pin
89:02 yet again energy drinks harden your
89:05 arteries okay why is that a big problem
89:08 well you may not know it but your
89:11 arteries oscillate like the body of a
89:14 worm right they pulse and oscillate why
89:17 do they do that well one it pumps a
89:19 little bit of blood but two it keeps
89:20 plaque from forming on your artery walls
89:23 you drink a ton of energy drinks it
89:26 hardens it doesn't oscillate and then
89:29 plaque it starts filming in your
89:31 arteries right around your heart and you
89:34 die of a heart attack how many of these
89:36 high school kids are dying right after a
89:39 football game or just dying because they
89:41 drink too much to scrap while they're
89:42 playing World of Warcraft right this is
89:45 why has it have any of these energy
89:49 drink companies ever been really sued to
89:51 a point where they're changing their
89:52 formulas and no once an industry is
89:56 worth a bunch of money then they're
90:01 basically too rich to fail you know the
90:06 cell phone industry what a joke in the
90:09 fire jeez come 5 G's coming one of you
90:12 who listens to the show commented in the
90:14 comments section or see the comment
90:17 section on YouTube or over in Facebook
90:19 I'd love for you to comment some more
90:22 they said look I just finished my
90:24 training on how to install 5g antennas
90:27 on light poles and they literally told
90:30 us we have to be 10 feet away we have to
90:32 be on the ground before it's powered up
90:34 otherwise I could just be killed
90:36 instantaneously by its emissions what
90:40 right doctors are running around the
90:43 world trying to tell people they're
90:45 gonna get completely destroyed
90:48 genetically diabetes and hypertension
90:50 and mental problems ADHD and addr going
90:54 to just become
90:55 mainstay thing as all these schools ran
90:56 out their grounds for antennas do you
91:01 care do you care how much do you care
91:04 great do you care enough to just go mmm
91:06 that's bad or do you care enough you
91:08 know I don't have any kids
91:09 yeah they're in school anymore I guess I
91:12 have a kid in school she's a teacher but
91:14 you know once you know your stuff you at
91:16 least protect it a little bit but these
91:17 kids that haven't had their destinies
91:19 yet and because if the kid has a problem
91:22 paying attention in school what do they
91:24 do
91:24 load the kid up on a bunch of drugs
91:27 another future lie is viruses and
91:31 vaccinations right all these things that
91:35 have been eradicated from the world you
91:36 now have to take a vaccine to keep them
91:38 eradicated from the world right you will
91:42 find the people who think you should
91:44 take vaccinations are the same kind of
91:48 people that believe that you should eat
91:50 GMO you know or even the people that are
91:54 clean they have no GMO and their kids
91:55 they still force them to take all the
91:57 vaccinations richest people in the world
92:00 don't vaccinate their kids Obama doesn't
92:02 vaccinate his kids right I think you
92:08 feel me on this one but I think this
92:10 one's just a gold mind of lucidity when
92:14 someone threatens you with the potential
92:16 future in order to affect change that's
92:20 going to erode your freedoms immediately
92:22 that's a problem now the case of NASA is
92:25 just stealing your money and God knows
92:29 what the money goes right I mean maybe
92:31 NASA is just one of the the greatest
92:34 welfare programs for smart people
92:36 because they do have tons of PhDs and
92:39 master's degrees and aspiring PhD people
92:42 work in interns they're gonna get their
92:43 PhDs
92:44 alright so did we just create this weird
92:47 slush fund for smart people in the
92:49 country all right
92:50 maybe if you were to come clean on that
92:52 idea and give us a roadmap of the
92:55 technology that you're actually gonna
92:56 create instead of just sitting around
92:58 doing [ __ ] all day long maybe maybe
93:01 we would support that problem reaction
93:05 solution the david icke distill
93:08 out of the order out of chaos is a
93:11 beautiful little thing to remember
93:14 maybe that's the step to when you call
93:17 out someone who's trying to control you
93:19 with the potential future threat I mean
93:22 he couldn't sell and damnation all the
93:23 way to climate change all the way to
93:26 vaccinations right hey you know all
93:28 these people have acts they're kids
93:29 yelling at parents that don't as if it's
93:32 a threat to their kid
93:33 think about how asinine lis ignorant
93:37 these human beings are I mean they're
93:39 ignorant on a level they're actually
93:40 they're stupid on a level that is just
93:43 it's gotta be a record somewhere right
93:46 like a Guinness Book of World Record of
93:48 how [ __ ] stupid you are to say wait
93:51 you vaccinated your kids before
93:52 everything right mm-hmm and your
93:55 vaccinate see right dumb parent yeah
93:56 uh-huh
93:57 oh well then you're completely [ __ ]
93:59 cured for the rest of your life you'll
94:01 never catch these diseases right that's
94:02 your whole [ __ ] theory right yeah so
94:04 if my kid doesn't give accident and I
94:06 don't get vaccinated we'll just watch me
94:08 die then of all this stuff ah what
94:11 you're gonna really find isn't my kid
94:13 doesn't have to get on these these drugs
94:15 because they're not [ __ ] up they never
94:17 turned into autistic kids and watch them
94:21 just walk past your kids right look at
94:26 the life expectancy of me and I'll I'll
94:28 be at your funeral how about that what
94:30 do you want me to do at your funeral
94:31 because I'm definitely going to yours
94:32 you ain't going to mine right unless you
94:35 buy a gun cuz you're crazy right wisdom
94:38 it's great stuff man anyway let me know
94:42 what you think and if I missed one put
94:46 that in the comment section as well
94:47 because we might revisit this inside of
94:50 other episodes I just visited a bunch of
94:52 weird [ __ ] in this episode hopefully was
94:53 entertaining I'm in this loop right now
94:57 for courting a knight I'm trying to
94:58 create a backlog again because I like
95:00 having like four or five videos in the
95:01 backlog because that allows me to kind
95:03 of release them sort of under
95:07 stream-of-consciousness of like okay I
95:09 made him listen to that kind of [ __ ]
95:10 that's for me so I'm gonna give them
95:11 this one for them and it's cool so I
95:15 kind of only got a couple in the backlog
95:17 right now
95:18 but if you haven't please go to deep
95:20 thoughts radio calm for all the links
95:22 it's the hub for the whole movement you
95:26 know the the objective of this entire
95:28 show if you missed it way back in season
95:30 one is to rebuild society from the
95:32 ground up using society not just me
95:35 right I'm just a little little you know
95:37 nugger think about this how about that
95:41 but on there we have two video YouTube
95:44 and [ __ ] you please go make a [ __ ]
95:45 shoot account it is the back up to
95:47 YouTube if they happen to go crazy on us
95:49 which they haven't they do D monetize
95:51 every single video and I have to
95:52 petition to get them released but you
95:55 know I'm gonna say they rarely D
95:59 monetize for a reason that I don't
96:01 understand let's just put that way so
96:02 that's cool if you like podcasting get
96:05 up there with your favorite podcast
96:06 software I use a product called podcast

96:11 well the iOS it's probably the best one
96:14 to use don't use iTunes if you can help
96:16 it but you're probably forced into it
96:17 because that's how Apple rolls we have
96:21 three social media Facebook lock group

97:16 promote which is brave browser which
97:18 cuts out all the ads and trackers
97:20 basically all the metrics that
97:22 Zuckerberg sold to Cambridge analytics
97:25 able to cut all that off which is
97:27 beautiful right it doesn't cut out his
97:30 data but it cuts out all the ancillary
97:31 stuff
97:32 being sold to you which is great change
97:34 your search engine from Google to
97:35 DuckDuckGo Backblaze best online backup

98:04 fun I am telling you guys that bright
98:07 Tian has finally upgraded their policies

98:12 think I'm at right now it's three
98:15 hundred and thirtysomething views I have
98:16 to get before just views before I get to
98:19 the next 50 so once we have the next 50

98:29 yourself in someone else and I will see
98:30 you in the next deep thoughts over now
