00:21 [Music]
00:29 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts I'm
00:35 actually getting out before midnight I'm
00:36 almost like just shocked it's gonna be a
00:39 lot of fireworks going off even though
00:41 it's at least a week before the 4th it
00:46 turns out since so many firework shows
00:48 have been canceled all these
00:50 manufacturers are just giving away their
00:52 fireworks I don't mean that literally
00:54 but they're definitely selling it for
00:56 nothing so the United States is
00:58 extremely bumping to the point you've
01:00 had several articles written about it
01:02 but let's get to today's topic what do
01:08 you call the most skillful professional
01:11 liar in the world
01:14 what's that profession well it could go
01:18 either way but the best ones are called
01:21 actors that's what they do somebody
01:26 writes a story like me and it's just a
01:30 funnel piece of fiction but without
01:32 great actors those stories can never
01:36 happen and a lot of times it has to do
01:38 with the exact configuration of the
01:40 actors body their voice everything right
01:43 it's a very tough thing to get right
01:47 anyway when you're in a casting
01:48 situation and yet let me run a scenario
01:53 by you here you're at home you're busy
01:58 doing something that's Saturday Sunday
02:01 and the doorbell rings someone knocks at
02:04 the door you go no I think you know
02:07 someone's trying to sell me something
02:09 and so you open the door and it's some
02:11 random person you never met before they
02:13 look clean and cut and played out in
02:15 your mind everyone male/female doesn't
02:17 matter they look great on average you
02:19 know and they start talking about how
02:22 they're gonna be running for a
02:24 politician political seat excuse me
02:26 Senate House local anything and you're
02:31 sitting there kind of going yeah yeah
02:33 yeah okay I'm annoyed I really don't
02:35 want to be doing this right now
02:37 and so maybe you remember their name
02:40 maybe you support them maybe give them
02:43 some sort of contribution then you go
02:47 back to your business now in your heart
02:51 of hearts when we slow it down in your
02:54 heart of hearts you haven't made a huge
02:58 connection with this person because you
03:01 know who they are or maybe you know who
03:03 they are by name but you don't know who
03:05 they are you know because you never said
03:06 that I had a beer with him okay so fast
03:12 forward to the next week in same
03:14 timeframe doorbell rings hmm you answer
03:20 it you don't want him this time it's a
03:25 famous actor or actress actually actor
03:29 is a generic term for both genders let's
03:34 say it's Tom Hanks it's pretty popular
03:36 he's done a lot of amazing movies and he
03:41 is standing right in front of you and
03:45 he's asking for your support he's gonna
03:47 run for the Senate something and now
03:54 there's a bunch of things going on and
03:58 this is if you get to meet him I mean in
04:00 reality you can see this on television
04:01 you'd probably still have a very similar
04:03 set of emotions but now this dude's like
04:07 this possum over there she's huge now
04:11 he's asking for your support and then
04:13 right away what you feel in your heart
04:15 of hearts is of course I'm gonna vote
04:17 for you if you like him as an actor
04:20 because I already know you I don't know
04:24 the other person who came last week I
04:26 know who you are
04:27 I saw what is the bachelor party in
04:30 Forrest Gump in Philadelphia and that
04:32 series yeah on TV and the eighties
04:34 splash it on now isn't interesting and
04:41 what I'm giving to you probably up until
04:43 you know the recent chaos I definitely
04:48 would have experiences that's why I can
04:50 tell you the story
04:51 I haven't experienced but I I would hmm
04:57 no that's a weird one isn't it
04:59 listen to had weird the probably the
05:01 more qualified dedicated politician
05:03 maybe a Poli Sci major maybe they were
05:05 business men or women before they ran
05:08 for office the one that you don't know
05:10 might be extremely qualified for the job
05:13 but you're gonna vote for the actor
05:16 because you think it'll be fun to see
05:17 them more often Arnold Schwarzenegger
05:23 was the Governor of California
05:25 so was Ronald Reagan now we don't know
05:29 about Ronald Reagan he grew up in a
05:32 totally different era where corruption
05:33 of government was something that was not
05:36 well known I think it was always
05:38 perceived as way back in the French
05:40 Revolution timeframe or some other time
05:42 for him not the one we're in now he was
05:45 in German he wasn't in the United States
05:46 that sort of thing Ron Reagan showed up
05:49 a lot at the Bohemian Grove along with
05:53 Nixon and Teller you created the h-bomb
06:02 but by the time it got to Arnold
06:04 Schwarzenegger here and again for some
06:06 of you everybody knows who Arnold is we
06:09 had a coup going on in California from
06:14 the White House
06:17 we had gray Davis was the governor here
06:20 right around the turn of the millennium
06:21 and we had all of our power companies
06:26 who supplied California with its power
06:29 engaging in a coup to put all of the
06:33 power companies into maintenance modes
06:34 such that we were really low on power
06:37 and the Bay Area had San Francisco had
06:42 brownouts I worked at Electronic Arts
06:44 I remember being up on like a fifth
06:47 floor and just watching buildings turn
06:50 off so he's trying to find cheap power
06:55 hydroelectric has been banned in United
06:58 States of America since 1973
07:00 Canada has
07:02 really cheap hydroelectric because
07:03 they're not idiots right they're not run
07:06 completely by the oil company as I would
07:08 say all right
07:10 Gray's about to ice over the deal great
07:13 Davis with Canada George Bush jr. as I
07:18 understand it this is out was reported
07:20 to put an injunction in from the White
07:22 House to californee I don't even know
07:23 how you legally do this and he said
07:24 you're not allowed to buy a Canadian
07:26 power cuz you gotta buy from American
07:28 first if you have a choice
07:30 my college roommate I'm speaking for
07:32 George Bush jr. started up in Ron you're
07:36 gonna pile your power from Enron the
07:40 power rates were insane I've seen
07:43 reports as low as ten times the price
07:45 for the power as high as 40 times the
07:47 prices of the power and this state goes
07:50 in two dead three to five billion
07:53 dollars in like six to twelve months
07:55 buying this power because it has to
07:58 subsidize it because we can't pay the
08:01 price that the state is buying the power
08:03 out it's too high and of course Enron
08:06 turns into a complete debacle some
08:09 people disappear themselves so you never
08:13 have to pay their dues now here we are
08:16 in this plan Demick bunch of [ __ ]
08:20 and at least in my circle the most vocal
08:24 people that are telling you to accept
08:27 the tyranny accept the loss of freedom
08:30 same thing to wear masks that don't do
08:33 anything for your body besides make you
08:35 breathe your own co2 using hand
08:38 sanitizers that are for bacteria not for
08:40 viruses I mean just man it's just making
08:42 you so I don't know vulnerable but
08:47 they're actors actors are pushing it out
08:51 as much as humanly possible she's got to
08:55 be in the shot right now what's
08:58 interesting about actors is that they
09:01 it's a dual edged sword right we've got
09:05 on one side of the sword we're watching
09:08 them pretend to be people that they're
09:10 not and the more they get typecast or
09:13 you know they they play that one type of
09:15 role
09:17 or they have a sitcom or a drama series
09:22 where they're playing the same exact
09:24 fake character forever you know Leonard
09:26 Nimoy played Spock for three years on TV
09:30 and then got to reprise that rule
09:32 several times with the new Star Trek's
09:34 and then the movies and all that good
09:35 stuff
09:35 there's got to be a part of Leonard
09:38 Nimoy before he died that he actually
09:40 not only architected the character Spock
09:43 off of you know Gene Roddenberry's notes
09:46 but he took part of it probably into him
09:49 which was a very noble character so
09:51 there's no problem bringing that in but
09:52 you take someone like Robert De Niro who
09:56 constantly plays these exaggerated
09:58 bambinos it's a total insult to the
10:02 truth of these individuals okay as much
10:04 as they do love him because it kind of
10:06 represents it's still like all
10:09 caricature of reality thing I think
10:11 sometimes they like it because in
10:13 fiction you could play it a lot tougher
10:16 then it's going on today even though
10:18 you're there oh gee mafia guys or beyond
10:22 anything we've portrayed on TV I think
10:25 we know De Niro thinks he's a tough guy
10:28 okay
10:30 he's like about five six not to say that
10:33 that takes down his potential but he's
10:36 been an actor he hasn't gone to jail he
10:40 hasn't you know been in any really
10:44 overly stressed situation other than the
10:46 art of learning what he does which is
10:48 you know he's a master at what he does
10:50 but now he has convinced himself that he
10:54 is the one of the characters for all the
10:56 characters that he's ever played that
10:58 are the tough guys
11:00 he also hangs out with Maria Brown a
11:03 [ __ ] and he's you know the devil
11:06 worshiping spirit cooking thing just
11:07 look that up Robert De Niro space spirit
11:10 cooking and the brunette 72-73 or a
11:14 woman he's hanging out with is the grand
11:17 Satanist on planet earth I've found at
11:20 least two different parties two
11:21 different suits he's wearing when he's
11:23 with her but the other side of the sword
11:26 is that
11:29 you know okay so there's two sides our
11:30 perception of them and their perception
11:32 of themselves and so imagine playing a
11:36 super intellectual part at times and
11:40 then taking yourself way too serious
11:42 now these writers that are putting it
11:45 together these researchers as writers
11:47 these directors all these individuals
11:49 making that role come alive in the
11:51 camera are actually doing all of the
11:54 hard work what does an actor really have
11:57 to do besides maybe like a Tom Cruise
11:59 who will actually jump out of you know
12:02 you know jets at 40,000 feet that dudes
12:05 just a baller on a whole level different
12:07 level but your average actor who's
12:09 fantastic and we love them they have to
12:14 look into a camera control all the
12:17 muscles in their face okay and there's
12:19 no physical blocking depending what they
12:21 have to do walking around a room and
12:22 stuff and then they have to in a certain
12:24 tone deliver a line that seems congruent
12:28 with the story at that moment in time
12:30 keeping in their mind a continuity of
12:32 all the other things that they said
12:34 right it's definitely you know not
12:37 something everybody can do I tell you
12:40 the ones that do it well they don't even
12:41 feel like they're working ever it's just
12:44 like when someone who sings you can't
12:48 sing out of tune
12:49 well they sing in tune all the time so
12:52 for them what might be daunting for you
12:54 is just nothing for them and then it
12:57 turns into art because they're like well
12:59 being in tune is one thing but now I
13:01 gonna be so full and what I'm making
13:02 rocker am I gonna be an operatic singer
13:05 you make your choices maybe you do it
13:07 all you're like Freddie Mercury you do
13:12 it all right but I hear you know a lot
13:16 of criticism against actors during these
13:20 critical events pick one great and I I'm
13:27 doing this episode because I want us to
13:30 define what the hell that means with
13:32 specifics because I definitely had
13:36 people you know make that criticism very
13:38 justly so
13:40 and I'm like hey I totally agree with
13:42 you 100% don't get me wrong and why why
13:47 should an actor have an opinion that
13:49 gets proliferate or doubt to millions of
13:51 fans such that the fan wants to be close
13:55 to the actor or the musician or whatever
13:57 they extort the their acceptance towards
14:00 you until you do what they say right
14:02 dee Schneider hates Trump so if you want
14:07 to be a douche neither fan you got to
14:09 hate Trump
14:09 Kid Rock like strum so if you want to be
14:12 with Kid Rock
14:13 yeah like Trump it's just a thing they
14:16 man they don't have to say it with their
14:18 own words but they're calling you names
14:21 it's a person you admire calling you
14:24 names because you don't have exactly
14:26 their archetype of thought which for me
14:32 you know there are so many like social I
14:37 guess I don't want to really call them
14:39 norms but good pieces of advice that are
14:41 being followed these days motley crue
14:46 motley crue is so famous in the midwest
14:49 where it's all conservative to centrist
14:52 you know definitely the majority of the
14:54 Trump supporters also like motley crue
14:57 depending on their age but both Nikki
15:00 Sixx and Tommy Lee have come out
15:02 probably all of them have but they just
15:05 can't get enough hate Trump hate Trump
15:08 hate Trump right you know you wouldn't
15:13 want to walk in any of their shoes trust
15:15 me but they're telling you if you buy a
15:19 ticket to our concert we'd actually
15:20 don't want you there because politically
15:23 you don't follow what we do and there's
15:25 that old advice they'll never talk
15:26 politics or religion in a public place
15:29 probably not a good idea even in your
15:31 private setting unless you know everyone
15:33 in the room is exactly generally aligned
15:36 with you I do it you know but they want
15:42 the divide to occur so it's all being
15:44 pushed in our face at this point but
15:46 take a website like LinkedIn calm so
15:48 you're supposed to find employers you're
15:51 supposed to associate with other workers
15:54 I don't know anyone in the world that
15:57 would ever advise you to go to work and
15:59 start talking about politics or religion
16:01 at work it is just an absolute
16:06 brain-dead agreement that we have that
16:09 that is the horrible subject to bring up
16:12 because if you really get down to it you
16:14 don't interpret your Bible whichever
16:16 Bible you want to use the same I'll care
16:19 if you're a Buddhist you just don't
16:20 interpret things the same and you get
16:23 into a dispute where you get to a
16:24 pivotal moment where you think this
16:26 other person is worshiping the devil and
16:29 you're worshipping God or they think the
16:31 opposite and okay what is LinkedIn
16:36 LinkedIn is turned into pretty much the
16:38 secondary Twitter people up there
16:41 virtuous signaling all day dragging
16:43 their political things up there all day
16:45 so I literally sit there now and I look
16:47 at a company I go I would never work for
16:49 their company as long as these
16:50 individuals work there because their
16:54 priorities aren't focused on the goddamn
16:56 business for one thing I would have
16:58 fired him like if I catch any my
17:00 employees putting their [ __ ] up and it's
17:01 a professional realm whether it working
17:02 for me representing my company not all
17:04 of them do that but the idea is like
17:07 look shut the [ __ ] up would you write
17:09 and lock your facebook if you can't shut
17:11 up because we have potential clients
17:13 they're gonna see you posting that crap
17:16 and they're never gonna do business with
17:17 us again we're in this thing together
17:21 to make money to go to the next level to
17:23 go the next level and if you're killing
17:25 all of our business because you won't
17:27 shut up because of whatever psychosis
17:31 you have as an individual you're gone
17:34 you're not a professional yeah there's
17:39 another sort of example I'm going to
17:43 give you that is just designed to get
17:47 your brain to see the double standards
17:49 or ground things that we would otherwise
17:52 accept now there is a probably 51% or
18:00 more majority of the world that probably
18:03 believes that prostitution
18:05 male or female is not a great
18:08 profession for anyone because you know
18:10 eventually doesn't work out over time
18:15 because you get old and then you don't
18:16 have a career and your body's been
18:18 potentially abused and you know whatever
18:21 okay so we we say prostitution is a bad
18:26 thing it's all the way back to Christ
18:28 time rate oldest profession in the book
18:31 right all right but what about
18:36 pornographic material you want to shoot
18:39 a pornographic movie what's occurring
18:42 well the same exact thing that's
18:44 occurring for prostitution I'm giving
18:47 you money to have sex with me
18:49 you obviously a prostitute solicits off
18:52 the streets it's not like they're hiding
18:54 in a hole and you chase them down in the
18:56 hole and you're gonna have sex with me
18:57 here's ten dollars right no no no
18:59 they're out there on the corners or out
19:00 there walking the streets of LA whatever
19:02 Vegas okay but as long as there's a
19:07 camera in the room all of a sudden it's
19:09 not prostitution hmm that making sense
19:14 and we're trying to do some math suckers
19:18 to some friends about this yesterday if
19:20 you do the math a person who's a porn
19:22 star won't be working every single day
19:26 necessary especially the female of
19:28 course the men do I guess
19:29 the females don't females get engaged in
19:32 situations that I don't think occur that
19:35 often in prostitution so we were trying
19:39 to figure out which one has sex the most
19:41 it's just interesting I think in some
19:43 scenarios when I find that the legal
19:46 thing though you know there's a lot more
19:47 action to it but now we just learned the
19:52 ron jeremy
19:52 the infamous 1970s porn star ron jeremy
19:56 i have men in a couple occasions seen on
20:00 several occasions yeah he's anything but
20:03 attractive nowadays he's been accused of
20:08 three four counts of three women with
20:11 another case pending he is sitting in
20:14 the LA County Jail as I understand it
20:17 with a six point six million dollar bail
20:19 over his head the dude that leaned
20:22 George Floyd even if there's a
20:25 conspiracy doesn't matter
20:26 the official stories that's what he did
20:28 he only is a 1 million dollar bill
20:30 bronze gas 6.6 now I don't want to
20:35 accuse Iran of anything right I've gotta
20:37 let the justice system do its thing but
20:39 if a porn star
20:44 or to get involved in a rape situation a
20:47 forceful sexual situation where there is
20:49 no consider what happened there
20:52 potentially he has been in the
20:55 pornographic business for probably 45
20:58 years I think who died oh no exactly we
21:01 shot his first one there's some old-ass
21:03 videos of him out there let's just round
21:06 it up to 40 40 years he has made money
21:10 having sex with women so then he's
21:15 accused of rape now let's just take Ron
21:18 out of this but someone he's got that
21:20 much profession behind them in getting
21:22 paid to have sex and and he's just
21:25 having you know what was it will
21:28 Chamberlain said he you slept with
21:29 10,000 women someone who's been in that
21:31 business for 40 years I'm thinking you
21:33 hit 10,000 a long time ago remember what
21:36 we said about the actors we know a bunch
21:39 of them start to believe the fiction
21:41 that they portray they become the
21:43 character my dad told me that at least
21:46 one of the characters of in the 50s this
21:50 is too sick to house to the story I
21:53 don't know how my dad got the other half
21:55 because there was no internet when he
21:56 brought this out but apparently the most
22:00 popular dude who played Superman on
22:02 television in the 50s ends up jumping
22:05 off a building my father heard that he
22:09 actually got to a point where he
22:11 believed he could actually do it and
22:12 that all he needed was the faith that he
22:15 was going to fly to do it and he jumped
22:17 off the building the official Wikipedia
22:20 is he committed suicide because he did
22:22 but the back story was that he believed
22:25 or he bought it so now you have porn
22:30 stars who they do take advantage of you
22:35 know really the producers these days I
22:37 guess so like just saw a video on this
22:40 they take advantage of these girls like
22:42 crazy and I had some clients and 90s who
22:44 were out of the business but had to sell
22:47 their old wares to live because they had
22:50 no profession they were still beautiful
22:53 to extremes but they hated the
22:54 professional said we're all
22:56 on drugs no sadly I don't think they're
23:00 all starting on drugs anymore they're
23:01 just doing it because of whatever so
23:06 porn actor rapes a girl there must be
23:11 like 4000 layers of irony in that that
23:16 you would even hang out with a porn star
23:18 and expect there not to be some sort of
23:20 fornication going on I can kind of
23:24 understand a little bit the woman who
23:26 was with Mike Tyson he's a boxer doesn't
23:31 exactly equal sex but you're going up to
23:33 his penthouse at 1:30 at night in Las
23:36 Vegas by yourself what do you think is
23:39 going to occur
23:40 come on of course the sad thing is the
23:44 innocent are taken in this whole game
23:46 right and that's where this thing meets
23:49 the pavement here we've laid down a
23:52 foundation of what can happen with
23:54 actors minds and a porn star as an actor
23:59 and so you have people that worship
24:04 actors worship them now I can understand
24:09 having done it myself as a young man I
24:12 think I was again I was 11 or 12 years
24:16 old yeah he was 11 and I saw my first
24:20 Prince performance on signing out live
24:22 or the guy said the f-bomb and I
24:24 actually heard it cuz I was in
24:25 Massachusetts at the time dude gets
24:28 fired the next day Prince drops two
24:30 singles plus the videos controversy and
24:33 sexuality the next day my dad video you
24:35 know records them on VHS and boom I just
24:39 heard and saw something that was
24:41 insanely unique you know I didn't get
24:44 the sexual vibe out of it because I was
24:46 so naive you know but later on you know
24:49 it was like just all through the
24:52 eighties it was like he was one of my
24:53 heroes there was a lot of them but he
24:57 was wrong but that's kinda silly he's
24:59 just a musician he's got a really cool
25:01 set of talents and definitely a super
25:04 unique year we won't see him again for
25:06 another hundred years probably
25:09 we know that project Mockingbird which
25:12 is again just for those have never heard
25:14 of that it's the CIA program that
25:16 started in the mid 50's to put news
25:19 anchors on payrolls to tell lies
25:23 again by 1970 the estimate was between
25:26 seven hundred and a thousand journalists
25:28 were on the payroll that's fifty years
25:30 ago so what five ten thousand people
25:36 know globally now that you've just taken
25:38 over the news right it's ap Reuters by
25:41 the way there's a little trend going on
25:42 right now if not a gigantic trend that
25:45 comments have been turned off all over
25:47 the world so TMZ turned off their
25:49 comments unless you want to share it out
25:52 to your social media Fox News now
25:56 cherry-picks articles where they are
25:59 selling you a big pile of poo okay you
26:03 can't comment because they know that
26:06 lucid people will be at the bottom
26:08 talking everyone out of the content
26:10 that's in the article where the article
26:12 doesn't matter Miley Cyrus you know
26:14 found she had a tongue in her butt that
26:17 you can comment so when you look at all
26:22 your social media out there today and
26:24 you see how just awful the world has
26:28 turned right now right it's never been
26:30 this negative in world history with a
26:34 sorry in modern world history right for
26:36 the last 150 years super negative you're
26:40 not to have any hope now you know Q's
26:44 doing his thing you actually just put
26:46 out a fairly decent response I actually
26:51 put a few comments out there myself this
26:54 last post he put out and I guess today
26:57 is the 29th I guess of June but I'm
27:02 saying look man you got to make a move
27:03 baby
27:04 this this hurry-up-and-wait [ __ ] is
27:07 like you know stop telling me I'm
27:08 impatient because the idea is you might
27:12 do a bunch of calculations just to
27:14 digress for one second here because this
27:15 does tie into our whole theme here let's
27:18 say you're part of the Q team NSA US
27:20 military
27:21 you are saying to yourself we know
27:24 everything and we got this whole game
27:27 corner 1 how do you know you know
27:30 everything how do you know maybe you
27:33 don't but maybe you think you do maybe
27:35 the people that really know everything
27:36 set you up to make you think you know
27:38 everything but still I need to know
27:42 what's the Occam's razor the guarantees
27:45 you really know everything because
27:47 here's the thing if your opponent is
27:49 allowed to exist right you built a
27:51 fortress you know you've got 30 foot
27:54 thick walls with on titanium
27:57 reinforcement and you look out there and
28:01 now they have is like Spears and and
28:03 rocks and maybe maybe a catapult you're
28:08 thinking hey look how far back they are
28:10 we can go goof off now I'm not saying
28:13 that's what they're doing but you could
28:15 be overconfident but as long as they
28:18 keep trying and keep going you never
28:20 know they might find the sewer drain and
28:22 climb right inside your place they
28:24 didn't need to defeat your wall they got
28:27 you they assassinate the president they
28:30 do something else kills whole family I
28:32 mean like you know they just killed off
28:34 some Kennedys right to make sure hey
28:36 don't talk about that vaccination thing
28:38 you know a world-class swimmer drowns oh
28:42 really that just happens you know so we
28:47 have friends that are getting
28:48 indoctrinated because of why well we
28:51 could look at it two different ways we
28:54 could be crass and we could say and I do
28:56 it all the time low IQ low vibration
29:01 mouth-breather never done anything with
29:05 their life never gonna do anything with
29:07 their life they're super duper trivial
29:09 to gods equation that doesn't need that
29:12 life to go through a whole process even
29:16 human beings could predict their entire
29:18 life but probably a 98% accuracy now God
29:23 wants people like you who think for
29:25 yourself you're pioneering new things it
29:27 doesn't mean you have to go off and do
29:29 something that we as human beings think
29:31 is amazing and famous
29:33 you just got to create a brain
29:35 it's never been created before or at
29:38 least get to that level where you can
29:39 join the hive mind of thinkers to then
29:41 contribute something that flicks a
29:43 little toggle switch and everyone else's
29:45 mind and then even though you don't know
29:47 what knocking that one Domino over does
29:52 but only it's like Excalibur right it's
29:54 like the Domino's Excalibur and only you
29:58 have the power to push that Domino over
30:00 but once you do that all the other
30:02 Domino's they've been waiting to fall
30:04 over start to tumble and everyone's mind
30:06 you could just have the most average
30:08 career average what you might think your
30:11 life but you're thinking for yourself
30:13 and you're helping us escape another
30:17 round of horrible monarchy tyranny
30:21 agenda21 stuff i mean it's it's gonna be
30:26 a revolution if we don't stop this and I
30:29 don't see that figuratively we we will
30:32 have to even Trump announced this sir
30:34 said this is one of his stomps in
30:35 Oklahoma this gets out of hand there's
30:38 gonna be a war and those of us who have
30:42 always had done since we were kids
30:44 and we know how to show them we don't
30:46 wanna not shoot well win a shoot I mean
30:48 it's gonna be probably a very quick and
30:50 bloody battle but it's in our best
30:53 interest to avoid that from occurring
30:54 which is why this show exists right
30:57 remember five years ago I said to
31:01 rebuilt the world from the ground up I
31:04 think that some of you got it first day
31:07 and others are getting it now more than
31:09 ever you know so we have to look at the
31:15 folks that are against freedom against
31:19 big government very sorry against small
31:22 government are folks that need to be
31:25 helped down a little bit and we have to
31:28 help them figure out what they actually
31:32 stand for so that they can pull their
31:35 head other ass and the one scene that
31:40 keeps reoccurring in my brain is the are
31:45 the lines of Democrats yelling at blacks
31:48 students who were trying to go into a
31:51 white school right your Democrat South
31:55 the Confederate flag South okay before
32:00 they created the fake switch in the 70s
32:02 right then they did documentaries in the
32:05 90s and they brought those people who
32:07 are screaming at those girls especially
32:09 this one woman and she's sobbing she is
32:11 so embarrassed about what she did I
32:17 think that there will be an incredible
32:20 majority of all these at least American
32:25 protesters right you don't know with NT
32:27 but once a kid shows up with the ski
32:29 mask and it goggles on all this other
32:31 stuff that's probably a George Soros
32:34 infiltrator from another country might
32:38 as well be right there terrorist
32:40 organization now show up with any of
32:41 that memorabilia on you they can arrest
32:43 you for a really long time touch a
32:45 statue
32:46 ten years kind of cool right so there's
32:49 going to be the overwhelming majority
32:51 will only participate in a protest once
32:54 or twice and they're done maybe for like
32:56 2020 they'll do everything they can in
32:58 2020 but they won't do anything beyond
33:00 this point one life catches up with you
33:03 right love these kids are the super
33:06 duper privileged white kids who are only
33:08 able to protest because the parents are
33:11 paying their bills it's just it's been
33:13 it's been like that forever the kids
33:18 that could do the communes in the 60s
33:20 and early 70s for all white privilege
33:22 kids with rich parents if you remember
33:25 the beginning of the movie up in smoke
33:28 with Cheech and Chong their debut movie
33:31 it's Chung's character Chong was the
33:35 hippie getting up in the morning with
33:37 his rich parents downstairs and he's
33:40 flipping them off and he's eating
33:42 they're making a crazy breakfast
33:44 contraption he's smoking a bong and he
33:46 gets in and teaches the one with the
33:48 family he's a man he has his own
33:51 lowrider car out front that's the
33:53 difference one earned everything and one
33:57 was given everything I want to make sure
34:00 that you have
34:01 some things just on the tip of your
34:04 tongue when someone starts to pass on to
34:08 you things from both a political realm
34:12 and things from an acting room but the
34:14 acting one is a lot easier which is why
34:16 this episode as the name it has they
34:20 haven't been politicians quite yet
34:23 they're professional liars we just call
34:27 it acting to make it regal we like the
34:30 fact they do what they do a magician is
34:34 in some ways also a physical liar we
34:39 like it it's deception it's misdirection
34:44 it's a trick it's cool I haven't heard
34:49 any magicians come out like I've heard
34:50 acting friends of mine you know it's
34:52 like I've got I put this way right now
34:57 in my life I've got one actress who I
35:00 love dearly I still love her regardless
35:02 of her opinions being on a train go in
35:06 the opposite direction than my opinions
35:08 and I've got a very famous musician
35:12 friend of mine super famous super uber
35:15 famous who is a little more chill about
35:18 it but I heard him I've heard about his
35:22 perception of what our last president
35:24 was and his most inaccurate thing ever
35:28 but he was so swept up by the by the way
35:34 that our last president talked that he
35:37 doesn't see all of the craziness and you
35:41 know what's crazy were in the middle of
35:43 well Turnagain is fizzling out like
35:45 America always does this black lives
35:46 movement thing is losing its steam
35:49 because society's been bred on
35:51 cellphones now so we don't have the
35:53 attention span to hang onto something
35:54 thus these episodes are an hour to two
35:57 hours long apiece right it's deep
36:00 thoughts not just you know thinkers you
36:05 know I say a little bit of a think you
36:08 know but he was a very easy he's a black
36:13 guy and
36:16 he's very upset about what happened as
36:19 everybody should be and regardless again
36:21 if one thing's fake there's a bunch of
36:23 it that's very very real and it's just
36:26 it's just crazy it's just coming from
36:29 the Midwest where you have you know
36:32 descendants of famous cowboy families
36:35 you know it's like we had the Hatfield
36:37 McCoy is in my area of the world we have
36:39 Dodge City 300 miles away that DNA was
36:43 still there and you had these guys that
36:45 if you were to you just wouldn't get
36:51 shot all the time for everything because
36:53 the man wouldn't shoot you especially
36:56 wouldn't shoot you in the back is even
36:57 in Dodge City you shoot a guy in the
36:59 back you're done you're you're his fault
37:02 just as much as whatever the guy did
37:04 that pissed you off there was honor but
37:09 we know a million reasons why cops shoot
37:12 people okay so he's trying to get
37:15 everyone a word to be a litt don't blame
37:18 him I tried to do the same thing now but
37:22 he's pumping up the last president
37:24 because he talked better than the
37:25 current president mm-hmm
37:28 I definitely liked the fact that he
37:30 didn't attack people 24/7 that shit's
37:32 getting old for me with our current
37:34 president really oh shut up
37:36 lead or get off the pot dude you know
37:40 but now he doesn't mention the fact that
37:45 the last president overthrew Egypt
37:48 because Egypt was on board with Libya
37:52 and creating this gold back dinar they
37:54 knew if they got rid of Muammar Qaddafi
37:58 the leadership in Egypt could simply
38:00 take over
38:01 Gaddafi's project and get the gold back
38:03 dinar to occur so all right so they
38:07 overthrew Egypt and they just ransacked
38:10 the place destroyed the infrastructure
38:12 of the country itself such that two
38:16 years ago a black man was sold for 800
38:19 bucks outright some of these people
38:21 captured from you know further south
38:24 inside Africa then it went down to $400
38:28 the neck
38:28 shir but since there's such ample supply
38:31 now they're sold for 200 bucks $200 I
38:35 just had this come to me for like for
38:37 whatever people going can you believe
38:38 this and I'm like yeah and to think that
38:41 a black man would pump up you know a
38:44 half-black half-white president for
38:47 doing such a good job because you know
38:51 in the middle of a black lives matter
38:52 situation where you got a guy trying to
38:55 get with 14 trillion dollars out of the
38:56 United States for um you know 40 acres
39:02 and a mule thing no one's gonna [ __ ]
39:05 pay that no one owned slaves per capita
39:09 I mean if you had every single was to
39:11 the 350 million people roughly United
39:13 States that number go down at 3:40
39:15 recently over at 360 of the day so here
39:19 my numbers go up and down in their area
39:20 because they can't get someone to say
39:21 the same thing twice I guarantee you in
39:24 this country 98 and 99 percent of people
39:27 who live in America in the last 400
39:31 years have never owned any slaves but a
39:34 bunch of them were slaves working on
39:36 plantations really whipped and and kept
39:42 for reading books and worshipping
39:44 religion no but they had their own
39:47 version of it so we're not saying bad
39:50 things didn't happen okay but see the
39:55 cognitive dissonance in this one dude I
39:58 bet he doesn't know that that's what
40:00 happens in Egypt
40:01 cuz he's just an actor okay and he's a
40:07 musician too mainly an actor these days
40:10 alright see when they're too busy to
40:16 study history but they're the ones
40:18 swaying emotions great my actress friend
40:23 I can tell if she could even name all 50
40:26 states
40:26 I would be unblown away like here's a
40:29 map tell me which state is which state
40:31 more about spelling just tell me which
40:34 ones which I'd be shocked or sure Idaho
40:38 and Ohio would get mixed up
40:41 Indiana and Mississippi be reversed you
40:44 know something Tennessee and Kentucky be
40:47 reversed right I mean just would get
40:49 crazy Senate was it Virginia and West
40:52 Virginia get mixed up right now it's
40:55 okay sometimes if you don't know some of
40:57 that stuff slides you just don't weigh
40:59 in with some heavy opinion like you know
41:02 the history of the world history United
41:04 States and we all know we were taught
41:06 [ __ ] history so then you have to go
41:08 on the pilgrimage to get the good
41:10 history you know if you just reflect
41:14 back to the NASA indoctrination episode
41:16 for one second and borrow a little
41:18 tidbit from that the whole episode is
41:20 catalyzed by a twenty eight-year-old kid
41:22 who just graduated some from aerospace
41:24 he's a mathematician very legitimate
41:27 brilliant mathematician kind of knew
41:31 what was going on the world but when it
41:32 comes to his science he was
41:35 indoctrinated and he thinks he is
41:37 actually more accurate with his thoughts
41:40 than the average person who can just
41:42 think logically and that should be the
41:44 case if he was taught the correct
41:46 science and that's a kid going in to get
41:51 a degree by graduate degree and going
41:55 for a PhD okay so what about an actor a
42:00 musician now there might be some
42:04 prodigies out there that I'm completely
42:06 unaware of you know it's funny is you'll
42:08 find out that someone has a college
42:10 degree in acting or that's not acting
42:13 right they they if you go to Julliard
42:16 and you get a degree in acting
42:17 what is Evers theatre and maybe dance or
42:20 something then that's why they're so
42:22 good at what they do and that makes
42:23 complete sense to us but anytime you
42:25 find out that someone has a degree and
42:27 something totally different its
42:29 mind-blowing
42:29 you know what was it David Bowie went to
42:34 school to be I think an accountant I
42:35 think John Cleese went to school to be
42:37 an accountant Graham Chapman was just
42:39 med school actually became a doctor so
42:43 you know if those people talk about
42:47 something at some point in their history
42:48 your ear can listen a little bit better
42:52 now let's go over to the politician side
42:55 things they're sort of a positive- thing
42:58 with the way that we run our political
43:03 systems in a free world here's the good
43:07 news
43:08 anyone who desires to be in public
43:11 service can run for office as long as
43:14 they're of age and I believe you don't
43:17 know if you like you can be a felon but
43:21 you know you just get past the basic
43:22 requirements which I think most people
43:24 can pass and you could become a mayor
43:28 governor a senator a house
43:30 representative all kinds of different
43:33 positions right you could be inside of
43:36 an administration and just do what you
43:37 do best you got a degree in economics
43:39 and you go work for the Treasury
43:41 Department all right you just marry the
43:44 president's daughter and you just get
43:46 shoot right in and there's some great
43:49 people running for office all times but
43:54 what's the game the game today is money
44:00 running the campaign because now instead
44:04 of going door to door as a regiment that
44:06 is enforced by law as your only regimen
44:09 to get your word out which is an absurd
44:11 thing I know you now have to put ads on
44:15 television you have to put ads inside
44:17 the internet you have to do mailers and
44:20 just hope at some point someone sees
44:23 what you're doing remembers your name
44:25 such that when they go to the ballot box
44:26 they push the button and poof you get
44:30 elected I have been I've been in a
44:35 situation in the last six months where a
44:39 friend of mine is running for Senate
44:42 if she wins it'll be a great victory for
44:45 her state I'll call her out completely
44:48 but she as she does her circle she's
44:51 meeting other people and they've come up
44:54 to her and they said yeah I like your
44:55 website like way it looks and she's like
44:57 this dude did it he's a friend of mine
44:59 he told me to run for office before I
45:01 ever thought about he bought my domain
45:02 before I ever thought about doing it and
45:04 now I'm running and now it looks like I
45:06 got a shot
45:07 if this woman gets endorsed by Trump
45:10 showing but she brought me a couple
45:14 people just to referrals she doesn't
45:15 have time to vet these individuals
45:17 personally but she brought me three
45:21 people one of them's working out so far
45:23 and we're just getting started here and
45:26 she brought me one guy who you know god
45:30 bless him he's a former military dude
45:32 yet three or four kids single dad that's
45:37 a tough one right there and when it came
45:41 time to build his online presence I said
45:44 okay here's the deal
45:44 I can build this you saw what he did
45:47 with her site you like it right yeah
45:49 great I want to ask him for some money
45:51 yeah a little thing well then any money
45:54 oh so where's this campaign gonna go oh
45:58 why I need the website to make money as
45:59 I did I'm not asking you for a lot of
46:00 cash you gotta have at least that much
46:02 for me
46:02 that now that's that okay maybe I'll do
46:06 the long play with this dude and I get
46:08 part of your donations until I get paid
46:11 off what I'm owed and then it's rest of
46:13 its yours I said dude write me your
46:16 platform what are you staying for if you
46:19 don't like the border you like the
46:20 border give me a paragraph about that if
46:22 you think the Second Amendment great
46:23 write a write a paragraph about that
46:26 apparently he lacked the vocational
46:28 capability of stringing together
46:30 sentences to make a paragraph I sent him
46:34 a list of bullets I said these are the
46:36 bullets you gotta hit
46:37 I'm spoon-feeding him into his own
46:42 campaign
46:43 can you imagine it's like being an
46:46 eight-year-old watching a racecar a
46:48 NASCAR race or something or f1 racing
46:50 going I want to be that tomorrow I want
46:52 to be that you know and they here's your
46:54 car kid well I don't know how to drive I
46:55 can't reach the pedals you do it all for
46:58 me right no what the dude finally just
47:00 vanished off the face the plane I even
47:04 set up his domain it was fully
47:06 functional WordPress just waiting for it
47:08 this guy was so utterly unqualified for
47:11 this position it was unbelievable
47:13 talking to him on the phone I could tell
47:15 he's not a camp being guy he's not a guy
47:16 could go to a podium and say what's up
47:19 and convince someone to vote for him
47:21 over someone else in accumbens second
47:26 dude to get some mortars across the
47:32 street we're gonna do one more you can't
47:36 you can't get it in the microphone at
47:38 all but the earth shakes when he's
47:39 mortar to go off across the street
47:42 second dude wasn't running for any major
47:45 political office he's goin some minor
47:47 role in his city great guy talk to
47:51 monolith oh really seemed like he had
47:53 the charisma to pull this off so came
47:56 time to make his website and what a
47:57 websites require pictures and words
48:01 didn't have his platform but I'm pretty
48:03 sure he could have written his but his
48:04 whole thing was he had like a lot of
48:07 social media said he had multiple
48:08 Facebook pages which is a super bad idea
48:10 because you have to put your message in
48:14 a million different places you know and
48:16 nobody has the time to do them just
48:18 increasing your costs and it's just bad
48:21 right
48:22 he had one picture of himself that was
48:27 remotely professional the rest were all
48:28 I mean they looked twenty years old like
48:32 low res cameras horrible editing on
48:35 these photographs and so Co vid you know
48:41 shelter-in-place was just turned on so
48:45 no one can go outside nationwide we got
48:48 weeks and weeks and weeks of sitting
48:50 here doing whatever we're gonna do with
48:53 our time so I said to the guy get out
48:57 your phone and please take a picture of
48:58 yourself have a friend take a picture of
49:00 you you got time brother you got time he
49:05 actually asks me just kid this man he he
49:09 heard my background I told him my
49:10 background you know made video games for
49:14 25 years I was an artist I mean a
49:17 programmer engineer blah blah blah he
49:20 says to me the following statement well
49:23 do you know how to take images down from
49:26 Facebook basically like I'm gonna you
49:29 know like I'm asking a ridiculous
49:31 question so he's given me a ridiculous
49:33 answer
49:34 I'm like really you know yeah I do
49:39 yeah well know how you why don't you
49:41 [ __ ] tell me how to do that right he
49:44 the reason why I'm telling you these
49:46 stories this is you understand that
49:50 politicians come out of a goddamn
49:53 American Idol crash and burn real half
49:58 the time so you do look at these Pelosi
50:03 super [ __ ] 80 years old Feinstein's
50:05 85 she's 86 this year and it's like
50:08 ladies are you ever just gonna go home
50:13 you're ever just gonna go home because
50:16 eventually you're all gonna go [ __ ]
50:17 batshit crazy like like Joe Biden's
50:20 going batshit crazy
50:21 he is absolutely in the death spiral of
50:24 Alzheimer's or dementia one of the other
50:28 I think he'll be physically off the face
50:31 of the planet by next year this time
50:33 you'll be in the ground next year this
50:35 time only because of his age and his the
50:39 fact that his disease is gonna basically
50:41 rack his organs eventually there's
50:44 nothing else he'll be roaming around
50:45 because you know Ronald Reagan had the
50:47 same thing supposedly I think he owned a
50:50 ranch in Topanga Canyon with Nancy and
50:53 they had to hide him for the last five
50:55 years of his life I think didn't you
50:56 make it tonight or something 83 or
50:58 something because he was crazy so
51:03 compared to the folks that I have been
51:07 encountering recently on the back
51:10 channel of the whole thing great they
51:11 don't have the position yet they want
51:13 the position even the occasional cortex
51:18 Cortes looks like you know a Mensa high
51:24 honors member because what's interesting
51:30 about the folks that are up there doing
51:32 negative things to the country in my
51:33 opinion is that they still are extremely
51:37 clever extremely brilliant now so I can
51:40 blow sees gets old she's trying to give
51:42 a trick like some Tribune out it's a
51:45 George Kirby whoever that is
51:47 that doesn't matter right the cognitive
51:50 dissidence is so powerful it doesn't
51:52 matter Joe Biden is a nun convicted
51:54 pedophile right
51:56 his c-span footage of touching children
51:59 should be circumstantial evidence good
52:02 enough to give him a few years in prison
52:05 now who knows what he's done on the
52:07 back-channel maybe that's all he does
52:09 when he's just a big toucher and a
52:11 little girl he put your hand on my junk
52:13 on the outside of my slacks that's all
52:15 he does but that's enough to get you
52:16 some time and so I'm did that to your
52:19 kid what would you do seriously you go
52:21 to church you go to someplace where
52:23 you're supposed to trust the people
52:24 since we don't hang out with politicians
52:26 I'm using a church as an example
52:27 whatever and an old man grabs your
52:32 eight-year-old daughter's hand puts it
52:34 on his junk on the outside of his pants
52:36 and you see it you're the dad you're the
52:38 mom what's the next thing you do you
52:43 know ho ho ho ho Joe he's always doing
52:46 he's to do to me when I was a kid so I'm
52:48 gonna let you have the same [ __ ] up
52:49 life that I am great but we know the
52:53 politicians eventually become actors if
52:55 they're allowed to get in we know that a
52:57 OC is completely controlled by some
52:59 outside force probably a George sorro's
53:01 force we definitely I think have I
53:04 believe this is true he is been linked
53:06 to her campaign financing all of these
53:11 crazy super PAC girls
53:15 they all have irregularities in their
53:17 campaign contributions you know what is
53:21 it Omar paid some random guy half a
53:24 million dollars to handle their website
53:26 amen
53:27 I was right here the whole time but then
53:30 she denies that she has any connection
53:32 with the dude and she married him two
53:33 months ago about two weeks after saying
53:36 she had no extra you know relationship
53:39 with the tude at some point the Democrat
53:43 has got to be able to say I am siding
53:48 with a bunch of liars but you know I
53:51 think the second half his but I hate
53:52 Trump so bad because he's a racist oh
53:54 really how's that work that I'm gonna go
53:57 ahead and vote for the pedophile who's
53:59 going crazy in his basement I don't know
54:02 that anyone in America that isn't for
54:05 term limits except those that vote on
54:07 themselves right that's what we have to
54:10 restructure government in my opinion
54:12 such that things like term limits are
54:15 something that is voted on outside of
54:18 the Senators voting on themselves there
54:21 should be a national ballot issue do you
54:24 want term limits and everybody goes yes
54:25 boom make an amendment to the
54:28 Constitution if you need to right but
54:32 they'll say they you know again it's
54:34 always some double standard yes and for
54:38 term limits okay look can we get rid of
54:41 all these old people out of there no no
54:43 no those are our favorite people yeah
54:46 Nancy Pelosi could could get all the
54:49 names wrong and one of her she does that
54:51 all the time she's because she's losing
54:53 her mind as well remember how Trump was
54:54 bullish for probably half a dozen
54:56 interviews she's losing her mind George
54:59 Florida George Kirby she gets lost the
55:02 second did she gets flustered and by the
55:05 way that's not new that flustered thing
55:08 that stuttering thing that Obama has -
55:10 she's had it all back since 93 when she
55:12 first got in office a little bit
55:16 smoother back in the day but now it just
55:19 looks like crazy Nancy yeah before you
55:23 think I'm just picking on one side you
55:25 know we have
55:27 probably God I don't know 10 20 30
55:30 million bankruptcies about to be filed
55:33 the next 60 days 60 90 days in America
55:36 because our current administration is
55:38 allowing the banks to rape us during
55:41 this little thing not allowed to work if
55:44 you happen to have a high-paying job
55:46 because high-paying jobs are shut down
55:48 offices can't be inhabited they try to
55:52 put us back in the closet again in
55:54 California but the banks can continue
55:57 charging you your your mortgage your
56:01 renters charge their renters or tenants
56:04 your credit cards are getting the
56:06 compound interests every single month as
56:09 if nothing none of this is happening and
56:11 no one's doing anything to protect us at
56:14 least Italy came out and said look think
56:16 was like a six month
56:18 total deferral with no bubble payments
56:22 of any kind you just put it on the end
56:24 of your loan if you own a house in Italy
56:26 like six months if you paid rent you
56:28 know to pay anything there's and you
56:29 don't ever pay it back because those who
56:31 own the houses can also get relief from
56:33 the banks they don't to pay the payment
56:37 not in America in America we're all
56:41 getting screwed by the bankers well Q's
56:44 telling us how great everything is
56:46 I'll give you an analogy of what I think
56:49 we're dealing with right now it's crude
56:54 but I think a very effective how many of
56:57 you especially the dudes you got a box
57:00 of wires you got power supplies that
57:05 have gotten tangled up with other power
57:07 supplies you get some thick cables
57:14 you've got MIDI cables maybe other kinds
57:17 of stuff mixed up stereo cables all that
57:19 stuff mixed up in a box and you just
57:22 kept throwing things in there for 10
57:24 years and now you need to get one of
57:26 those little cables out of there and you
57:28 see the one you need right there but you
57:31 pull on it and it's just a mess the
57:34 whole thing's a big ball and you look at
57:37 your watch and you know it okay for next
57:38 40 minutes I'm gonna pull every single
57:41 ready here like a game your grandpa gave
57:43 you when you were a kid or something but
57:47 think about what you the process of
57:50 untangling that mess okay there's a mess
57:53 I let it happen okay
57:56 I'm gonna pay the dues and untangle this
57:58 mess and the only way you do it is you
58:00 slow down time
58:01 there's no way to quickly do it and you
58:04 pull these cables out and you get the
58:06 ones that are twisted around each other
58:07 and you just you're feeding things
58:09 through and you just think you know man
58:10 I will never do this again
58:11 of course you will get some zip ties
58:14 that's the best way to do it so we have
58:17 allowed society to go tits-up globally
58:23 think about it
58:26 China India Africa and South America
58:30 have all been turned into sweatshops
58:32 where people make less than a couple
58:34 bucks a day okay then take your first
58:39 world countries and they're trying to
58:43 turn the world into an agenda 21
58:46 socialistic communistic mega racist
58:50 place and you know underneath that
58:53 there's a little there's a weird
58:54 substrate of like the Arab Brotherhood
58:56 trying to bring in Sharia law okay so
59:02 we've got some serious problems the
59:03 bankers are still in charge all
59:06 politicians are still in charge
59:09 if you fight for freedom you're a jerk
59:14 all the closeted racists have come out
59:16 privileged white kids just going to say
59:19 because that's what they are but the
59:21 privileged white kids who've actually
59:22 been racist their whole life and now
59:24 come out and tell you that you're a
59:25 racist and how bad you are and that's a
59:29 way for them to project their guilt onto
59:30 you this is what Democrats do in
59:32 generals what they did in the seventies
59:33 is to say that they had rid themselves
59:35 of the racism and they pushed it on to
59:38 Republicans now you will hear I think I
59:43 mentioned this once before but I want to
59:44 just clarify I mentioned this to a
59:48 friend of mine who's very educated and
59:50 he told me about the Damn Yankees way
59:53 back in the day
59:56 it was to account for the fact that the
59:59 South turned into the Union Yankees
60:02 after the Civil War what happens when
60:07 you get two sides struggling over one
60:10 piece of land it's called civil war and
60:14 then one side wins what happens to the
60:16 other side does it get to stick around
60:18 the way it was no because you're
60:21 fighting over a doctrine of how to run
60:23 the country you don't get to keep the
60:25 doctrine that the other half that one
60:27 doesn't want to exist and so at some
60:32 point you convert because you were
60:33 trying to be accepted all of a sudden
60:35 the war is over you know you know in 4%
60:37 of people fight a war in the first place
60:39 so the rest are just ninety ninety six
60:43 percent are just complicit people what
60:46 are we doing who are we now what do we
60:47 call ourselves okay that's what I am
60:48 then poof the South converts so in one
60:53 way you've got the old Democrat racist
60:57 brains the KKK brains the anti-slavery
61:01 abolishment Minds the anti desegregation
61:03 Minds they're all still down there
61:05 there's still the same people just
61:08 because they take the flag from the
61:10 north doesn't mean the flag for the
61:12 North agrees with their inbred methods
61:16 of you know cultural racism
61:18 so in closing you know one of the trends
61:22 I'm seeing is that we're all getting
61:24 stuck and left and right paradigm
61:27 thinking and every once in a while
61:29 someone posts on social media we
61:33 shouldn't have left and right we should
61:35 have something down the middle any when
61:39 you read it you're like oh yeah oh yeah
61:41 what am i doing what am i doing trying
61:42 to defend one side over the other well
61:46 there's just you know the human race
61:48 it's just right down the center
61:51 you know I've told the store a couple
61:53 times it's actually super important
61:55 right now which is according to my buddy
61:58 who's a big actor and comedian in the UK
62:03 he told me this story that you know back
62:06 in the 70
62:07 and probably a good portion of the 80s
62:10 very few actors were revered by the
62:14 population in any sort of like Beatles
62:16 way besides maybe Jerry Lewis ring
62:18 probably Benny Hill might have reached
62:22 that that status but even he'd never
62:24 spent any money guy made tons of cash
62:26 but he grew up poor they never spending
62:28 his own money but what he told me was he
62:32 goes look there were no there were very
62:35 little very few people that would
62:37 worship an actor or a musician like they
62:42 would royalty or a really brilliant
62:45 professor like a Stephen W Hawking he
62:48 was more of a movie star to them than
62:52 all these actors were that'll be very
62:55 interesting because I said to see of the
62:57 data some friends of mine and we're
63:00 smoking together and he and I said you
63:02 know what if we just turned off
63:04 celebrity status just turn it off it
63:09 becomes the most unpopular thing
63:11 globally is to say which you can't
63:17 control yourself or a particular
63:18 musician or actor we have all these st.
63:25 lists oh my god it's now easier to say
63:28 who isn't a Satanist an it is to say who
63:31 is one me and you not even believe in
63:33 that stuff they do it's their wrapper
63:36 for all their crazy sacrificial
63:38 adrenochrome stuff right and just
63:42 remember this happens a lot of my
63:45 dinners I'm having with certain friends
63:47 this whole reintroduction of abortions
63:52 you know it just pops up right during
63:54 the election process because they want
63:57 you to hate somebody you know if you
63:58 don't have how can you even have the
64:00 same opinion about abortion you can eat
64:03 up to people that have actually had
64:05 abortions talk to each other about the
64:07 policies around when you should be
64:09 allowed to have on how early you should
64:10 try to have one you know who's got
64:12 permission whatever how long it could be
64:14 you know in the womb before and they
64:16 totally won't agree it's a lose
64:19 whose argument a matter what but never
64:23 forget there is a business project
64:25 Veritas stung them with on video
64:28 they sell the body parts of these kids
64:31 and with adrenal chrome on top of it
64:34 it's sick it's just atrocious what's
64:38 going to get the adrenal chromes it's
64:41 like bad super bad so there's that whole
64:47 mess to clean up to and imagine that
64:50 what did I just say about the world you
64:53 know the overwhelming probably 70% of
64:56 the world's living in abject poverty in
64:59 poverty poverty Africa it's just living
65:03 in poverty doesn't have to they have all
65:06 the resources in the world to build
65:08 every company they'd ever build but
65:09 since they're controlled by people in
65:12 Europe no nuclear power plant allowed on
65:15 the biggest continent in the world you
65:19 have to pick through trash and sell it
65:21 in Uganda to make money you know their
65:27 health is just destroyed by being
65:29 exposed all these toxic things South
65:33 America has just been destroyed
65:34 Venezuela Brazil there's a trend you
65:38 know but to make that net stuff you can
65:43 find out by watching videos on YouTube
65:45 reading articles you see eyewitness
65:47 testimonies from the people and YouTube
65:49 is the best way to get the information
65:51 now do do various areas in the world lie
65:54 to get money sure you know in the last
65:57 three years we've exposed things to cue
66:00 it on the the scam or a particular
66:04 country will say that they have a
66:07 problem and then they get money from the
66:08 UN in the terms of hundreds of millions
66:10 of dollars if not billions of dollars to
66:13 rescue their country but there's a
66:16 hidden layer of intelligence agents
66:17 underneath that that say here comes the
66:20 money let's say you get 1 billion make
66:21 it easy
66:21 1 billion comes to comes to Venezuela
66:26 it's all messed up well about probably
66:30 850 million of that will go back to
66:33 the people that orchestrated the deal
66:36 154 lucky will go to the local
66:40 politicians to squander to hand out to
66:43 each other to build big mansions to fly
66:45 all over the world a lot of folks get
66:48 the money and quit their office and now
66:51 they're no longer vault they would move
66:52 away from the country that they got the
66:53 money for the people find help all the
66:57 time this kind of stuff happens do they
67:01 have no guns so they're powerless to do
67:04 anything all the statues have been torn
67:07 down of all the noble people that ever
67:09 existed in their countries so they have
67:10 no point of reference of what a hero is
67:14 what the what's going on now I mean is
67:18 this canceled culture thing is you know
67:22 I'll give you two examples that are
67:23 there's two and one and one on the other
67:25 so we have a butter in America with a
67:31 Native American woman a beautiful native
67:33 of work a woman sitting on the front and
67:35 I went and looked up it said something
67:38 wrong on an episode apologize I thought
67:40 they were instrumental in us perfecting
67:42 our butter recipes but it turns out they
67:44 didn't even have butter when we came
67:45 over here we brought it over from Europe
67:46 so that was my mistake so it kind of
67:50 makes sense I guess to say that a Native
67:54 American woman who's beautiful is an
67:57 offensive thing on a box I think it's
67:59 very sad because I'll get to that point
68:03 one second here on the black side of at
68:07 least two products we have in America we
68:09 have an Jemima syrup for pancakes and we
68:13 have Uncle Ben's rice okay now they want
68:20 to get rid of these three people off
68:22 these three different products two of
68:26 its pure racism coming out of a BLM
68:30 movement an Jemima was not a slave she
68:35 was a master chef who figured out that
68:38 recipe for this syrup I guess and she
68:40 got the cover of her own product now
68:43 they're pulling that off there her
68:46 families
68:46 petitioning not to allow that to occur
68:48 I'm sure there's gonna be a royalty
68:50 check that also disappears once her face
68:53 is taken off there but they're trying to
68:54 race a very accomplished black female
68:57 off of her product she completely earned
69:00 the right to be on that product in their
69:01 corner Uncle Ben same exact story chef
69:05 gets full of his own product
69:07 can you imagine are they gonna take Paul
69:09 Newman off all his [ __ ] all this popcorn
69:11 and mayonnaise and [ __ ] no because they
69:15 don't mind that the Democrats don't mind
69:18 the white guy staying on the white stuff
69:20 they just want all the blacks off the
69:22 black stuff I don't want a black person
69:24 in my kitchen I want to make rice and
69:26 not have to see a black man was
69:27 responsible for why I love this race I
69:30 want to be able to eat breakfast every
69:32 day with this syrup but I don't want to
69:33 have to give any credit to a black woman
69:36 now for the Native American thing
69:39 there's actually a really interesting
69:41 meme it's it's funny on one realm but
69:43 it's funny and sort of a McCobb way I
69:46 have that butter in my refrigerator
69:49 right now with the woman on the front
69:51 I'm going to keep the container once
69:52 it's over
69:54 but they've released the new box design
69:56 it's a sunset you know cartoony sunset
70:00 on the background where the woman was
70:02 sitting there and now the woman's gone
70:03 and the meme says typical America that
70:08 got rid of the Native American that kept
70:10 the land and it's almost on point
70:15 metaphor Native Americans if you don't
70:21 live in any place other you know if you
70:24 don't live in America who's having any
70:25 other place but America they've been
70:27 ground down to a tiny tiny tiny
70:29 population I don't even know what it is
70:32 but it's probably less than a single
70:33 person so what are we doing now I mean
70:40 if her family hated that it's not a real
70:42 person it's a fake thing but if there's
70:43 a bunch of tribes in America that say
70:45 that that's offensive like it would have
70:47 to be the overwhelming majority of the
70:48 tribes for me to buy it that they that
70:51 they approve of this you're just making
70:55 Native Americans disappear massively
70:59 racist am I
71:01 we need to remember that this was their
71:03 land and we need to do a hell of a lot
71:05 more than we've ever done been preaching
71:06 this for thirty years to my friends you
71:08 know it's like when I was writing my
71:11 first film you got a couple of your
71:13 reservations that are pure that are real
71:15 and you will see some easy fixes there
71:20 but no one's doing anything in fact
71:22 they're doing exactly the opposite
71:24 they're using intellectual minds to
71:25 repress the amount of existence you got
71:28 teams called the Indian you've got teams
71:30 called the Redskins all that's erased
71:34 okay let's say you do it in one year and
71:37 one year you take every black person off
71:40 all the black products and you take
71:42 every Native American off the Native
71:43 American products I don't know if
71:44 there's any other races on other
71:45 products but those are the two homegrown
71:48 you know regiments we have here in the
71:50 United States
71:51 what's more racist taking them all off
71:54 so you don't remember them anymore
71:56 they're gone forever but this is
71:59 supposed to be some big purchasing
72:01 dueling thing and it's anything but
72:04 isn't it these are the little logic
72:09 gates that are not tripping in people's
72:12 brains in my opinion I mean some people
72:16 do it and create the memes they try to
72:18 communicate to people and there's
72:21 another scam going on right now that
72:23 Facebook's doing I mean which which scam
72:26 like talking about right it's kind of
72:29 encouraging that people are boycotting
72:30 their their ads I can't say that there's
72:34 other than buying some stupid product I
72:36 don't need there's never an ad that's
72:38 ever any use on those platforms anyway
72:40 but I'm not an that guy
72:41 so my opinion really doesn't matter so
72:45 friend of mine posted an image that
72:49 someone went down to the actual
72:51 dispensing manufacturers box for those
72:54 masks that have blue side on one side
72:56 and white side on the other and again
72:58 there was a registered nurse that
73:00 basically lectured everyone that the
73:01 blue goes towards your face the light
73:02 goes out buddy mine said he read it the
73:04 opposite so she's a nurse she's not so
73:07 I'm gonna go with her thing that that's
73:09 the case
73:10 I see people wearing it properly
73:11 everyone said well that most people were
73:13 words according to this nurse but the
73:17 warning on the box says this mask
73:20 doesn't protect you against viruses and
73:22 specifically says kovat 19 right on the
73:25 box and it says the second you're
73:26 contaminated you gotta throw away the
73:29 mask about the second Turkey to me not
73:30 10 minutes after contaminate about 30
73:32 minutes after contaminated so it's a
73:35 manufacturer's warning on the box it's
73:37 not someone who wrote it and put it on
73:39 the box but Facebook Flags it and so you
73:43 click on why isn't this true and it's
73:46 the most [ __ ] boilerplate statement
73:49 you've ever seen it doesn't commit to
73:51 anything well part of this might be true
73:54 and part of this might be false oh okay
73:58 all right you know no specifics there so
74:05 bestie F oh man Christie a few sorry so
74:14 you know me if you know the show I
74:16 usually go at very generic archetypes of
74:18 thinking since that it applies to all
74:20 things we're at a point now where we're
74:24 coming up on a revolution we're coming
74:28 up on a situation that if it isn't
74:30 resolved it could go extremely bad you
74:36 know you know was it a month ago
74:38 you know this virus is so bad and
74:41 everyone's got to stay inside
74:43 you know we're masks don't do anything
74:45 for you like cloth mask like even
74:47 knitted masks it's just a joke right and
74:51 then the riots occur and no one cares
74:55 anymore you could be outside doing
74:57 whatever you want to do no complaints
74:59 from the liberal media that this was a
75:02 bad thing and now since Trump's like
75:05 punching himself directly into these
75:07 states to have these rallies again all
75:10 sudden now it's all coming back up again
75:12 just remember if you see people with
75:16 masks that are really lecturing here one
75:20 if they got it on they should shut up
75:22 it's sort of the vaccination thing to
75:24 the asymptomatic exposure
75:27 doesn't happen and I think Great Britain
75:30 they exposed 400 people to one person
75:33 trying to give them the virus nothing
75:35 happened
75:36 airborne can't be proven right most
75:40 viruses in the world can't handle this
75:43 whole thing can't handle the environment
75:49 how do people pass it between each other
75:51 well they're probably kissing each other
75:53 but even that probably took a lot of
75:55 kisses to get some virus to go out of
75:57 your mouth but they are going to be the
76:01 second the third and the fourth wave
76:05 they're already trying to hatch a new
76:07 h1n1 out of China right now just for an
76:10 article before I started this episode I
76:12 don't necessarily trust the source
76:15 whatsoever let's just remember - there
76:19 was fake news which is all the big
76:21 brands that we know lie 24/7 and barely
76:24 ever retract anything and then there's
76:26 fake news which is both sides creating
76:29 fake websites to pump you know very
76:33 manipulative articles to make us feel
76:35 one way or the other you know your
76:37 friend who will post like some really
76:39 outrageous article in some social media
76:42 and you look at the website and it's
76:45 like expialidocious you know calm some
76:48 giant ridiculous URL that it's not
76:50 affiliated with anything so you click on
76:53 it and there's a billion ads on the site
76:55 it's just viral made you click made you
76:57 look clickbait so I think what a lot of
77:01 people are doing now which is brilliant
77:03 go back to your tried-and-true stuff
77:05 that has kept you healthy your entire
77:07 life if you're at risk and take proper
77:11 precautions but you know what
77:12 once you hit 70 denier pre-existing
77:18 conditions or illnesses you've had up
77:21 until 7 you've really been very healthy
77:24 up till 70 then maybe you could play it
77:26 a little bit more relaxed you should
77:27 talk to your doctors to figure out
77:31 whether or not you're risk but I mean
77:33 again doctors hopefully it's a family
77:35 doctor you've known your whole life who
77:36 cares about you
77:39 it's all word of mouth now with people
77:42 that we trust that's pretty much where
77:45 we have to dial our perception of
77:47 reality down to not someone who's
77:50 regurgitating sound bites I don't know
77:55 if I think anyone in the political realm
77:57 of the world is doing a good job
77:58 anywhere on planet Earth to be honest
78:03 overall I'm seeing more progress which
78:05 from catching pedophiles
78:07 you know human trafficking stuff a lot
78:10 of ridiculous government agencies being
78:14 dissolved that need never needed to
78:16 exist in the first place or only needed
78:19 to exist up to a certain point and be be
78:21 dismissed if you've ever thought that
78:24 your life you know boiled down to a
78:27 moment word now you're very happy that
78:29 you think for yourself that's awesome
78:33 now and I think most of you do this on
78:36 daily basis but now is the time to try
78:39 and refine that power for change
78:45 you know I posted a phony backup I have
78:50 refused to post anything about what's
78:52 been going on on my one Facebook page
78:55 where I post anything other than the
79:00 deep thought stuff right but I saw a
79:03 funny video I don't know where this guy
79:05 uses a redheaded long-haired guy he
79:07 makes a lot of funny little social media
79:09 post he's usually making fun of
79:11 perception and he finally did one about
79:13 people being afraid of everything and
79:16 you know as long as there's a way to die
79:18 they're there they're not gonna go
79:19 outside anymore not gonna cross the
79:21 street anymore don't wear a helmet a
79:22 life vest made this funny little thing
79:25 so I post it on my page but I was very
79:27 strategic about it and that I didn't say
79:30 these are all those stupid people you
79:33 know you hate stupid people you're in
79:35 this video I could have said that and it
79:37 would have been they couldn't figure out
79:39 which way I'm going in life or the guy
79:40 that's that's quoting facts about how
79:43 ridiculous it is that people are taking
79:45 this too seriously or the guy that's
79:48 going nuts not wanting to go outside
79:51 anymore because you know
79:53 liberals can defeat mortality you're
79:55 gonna be locked in your house forever so
80:01 I just posted up there and I just said
80:03 the word yep and I knew that somebody
80:08 would take the bait and it's an old
80:10 friend of mine he's a coder he's a sweet
80:12 guy he's a genius but he's kind of he
80:15 came up to the to the post he said whoa
80:17 oh yeah what about this kind of trying
80:21 to get me to take a side and I will
80:22 never reply to the guy and unless he
80:24 pushes if he pushes all I'll reply I'd
80:27 be very disappointed I know he's part of
80:31 the campuses stay inside but then he's
80:33 got boatloads of money to sit side
80:34 forever because I'm an entrepreneur and
80:39 all my friends are I have a heartbeat on
80:43 Orange County and Los Angeles and
80:45 Ventura County of California probably
80:48 even some San Diego connections Long
80:50 Beach's in the middle about businesses
80:54 going out of business because of this
80:56 ridiculous [ __ ] that's going on
81:00 restaurants are going to disappear
81:02 mom-and-pop shops are gonna disappear
81:03 and the victors are going to be the
81:06 corporation's the bankers your big chain
81:10 restaurants are going to do just fine
81:12 your momma pop shops are gonna disappear
81:14 people are gonna go broke broke broke
81:17 like no money left in debt up to their
81:20 ears you have to be came out of the
81:22 thing if anyone did this to you
81:25 maliciously within your neighborhood but
81:29 there was only one person that was doing
81:30 it to you you could soon to death right
81:33 you could push all your debt over to
81:34 them for damages you could get damages
81:36 out of them psychological damages
81:38 financial damages long-term impact
81:40 damages all kinds of stuff would be a
81:42 cinch but now who knows why aren't there
81:48 class-action lawsuits against States
81:50 against senators civil suits you're the
81:53 one that you know so that we weren't
81:54 following science
81:55 therefore we weren't putting on a mask
81:57 when science says the masking doing
81:59 anything cognitive dissidence at its
82:02 most pure level you know people forget
82:07 Flint Michigan and how that whole region
82:11 was taken down because of NAFTA
82:14 you know homes no just we're just turned
82:18 out remember Michael Moore before he was
82:20 a complete scumbag he did a great movie
82:22 on that was his debut film he walked
82:25 around the neighborhoods and watched
82:26 foreclosures occur well prepare for that
82:31 to be the case all over America if we
82:36 don't make change you get a ton of
82:39 people unemployed and you're gonna have
82:43 chaos on a level you can't grasp you
82:48 know and it's always good to remember
82:50 that the depression that America was in
82:53 in the 30s kicked off during the 1929
82:56 stock market crash right but if you ask
83:00 historians when did the Depression hit
83:02 its peak its 1933 to 1934 that's when we
83:07 hit our peak that's five years four to
83:11 five years before the peak occurs I'm
83:14 gonna tell you right now that I know
83:18 personally at least 50% of the people I
83:24 know who owned restaurants businesses
83:28 50% of them will lose their homes their
83:31 cars
83:32 who knows if they have anything up for
83:34 equity it's gone stimulus checks what a
83:38 joke
83:39 what a joke I know dead people that have
83:42 gotten the checks okay but I I never
83:46 received one I got friends have made a
83:47 ton of money last year they got one
83:51 interesting so I consider each one of
83:56 you sort of a little soldier of truth
83:58 with your brain that thinks really
84:01 really well so get creative man get
84:04 creative with how you can dismiss some
84:06 of this stuff some of you are out there
84:08 you know protesting
84:11 very very peacefully of course just
84:14 trying to educate people keep it up keep
84:18 it up get creative do what you can and
84:21 make people see what they're not willing
84:23 to see as far as anybody is supporting
84:28 Joe Biden I mean just pick a video on
84:30 YouTube they have cleaned up a lot of
84:32 his videos and got rid of some of his
84:33 more egregious stuff I wouldn't
84:36 downloaded a whole boatload of them
84:38 about a month to go to make sure the
84:40 people are waking up there anyway and
84:46 this is kind of you know those darker
84:48 episodes but man is this important this
84:50 is something I never thought would ever
84:53 happen I just thought we're gonna be
84:55 able to you know clean up society you
84:58 know one person at a time we still have
85:00 jobs where solve our livelihoods and now
85:05 we're in something that's really
85:06 unthinkable for a ridiculous reason
85:09 anyone telling you put a mask on is the
85:13 problem unless you have conditions right
85:16 now again if you get on a plane you
85:18 probably all showed room wearing masks
85:20 on planes a long time ago because you
85:21 always get ill on a plane right I don't
85:24 know if it'll protect you against
85:25 anything but it's probably meaning a
85:26 bacterial problem on a plane but you
85:28 better bring two or three masks
85:30 depending how long your flight is I
85:33 would replace one every flight anyway
85:39 hope you enjoyed the episode hopefully
85:42 it was useful obviously your comments
85:44 are gold so you know if you've had any
85:47 successes in the way you've communicated
85:49 with really tough people that think
85:52 completely different than you then
85:53 please share that down below because
85:54 that becomes an instrument we can all
85:56 use yeah just let me know
85:59 I'm sorry what your thoughts are and if
86:02 you come into deep thoughts radio.com
86:03 please go so i'm spruced-up give you a
86:05 really quick bumper on that today I did
86:07 add parlor on to that social media I
86:11 think I just want to mention that real
86:12 quickly
86:13 doesn't have a lot of traffic yet but
86:16 Lisa's first member protected it's
86:19 trying to be a Twitter killer we'll see
86:21 but you have to video to audio it's all
86:24 up to date today do apologize
86:27 [ __ ] you ran behind because they've
86:29 been having catastrophic problems
86:32 apparently encoding the videos that put
86:34 up put up in Heaven's ecosystem three
86:37 times and it's still not processed yet
86:40 the next one went out no problem I know
86:42 the deal is but we have for social media
86:48 a couple ways to donate all new
86:51 remastered season one and the store
86:54 which is going to have a bunch of new
86:56 shirts here soon so you know the one
86:59 that's up there now is gonna go away but
87:01 don't worry a bunch of replacements are
87:02 going to be up there with one for each
87:05 one of the seasons and then some other
87:07 stuff I just kind of make it look sexy
87:08 so I'm still experimenting but that's
87:11 what I'll be doing tonight anyway take
87:14 care of yourself and someone else that I
87:15 will see you in the next deep thoughts
87:20 [Applause]
87:27 [Applause]
87:33 [Applause]
87:40 [Applause]
87:44 you
