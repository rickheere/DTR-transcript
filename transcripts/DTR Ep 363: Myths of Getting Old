00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts I thought I would just
00:40 make a fun little episode about the
00:43 myths of getting old and maybe I touch
00:48 on some of the physicality of the
00:50 argument but I don't really think I have
00:52 enough knowledge about that because I'm
00:54 still rocking the younger jeans here but
00:59 one of the biggest misnomers and I just
01:02 heard it repeated you will have heard me
01:04 say it several times on this show and I
01:07 just heard the the gentlemen inside the
01:10 leaving Neverland thing James he said it
01:14 too he said you know when you get older
01:16 you're just a little kid inside a bigger
01:17 body and that's so true isn't it so true
01:26 when were little kids we're looking up
01:29 adulterer people and of course they
01:31 always know more than we do when we're
01:33 teeny tiny kids and in most
01:35 circumstances but there's this weird
01:38 moment where your tires either start
01:41 gaining traction or they don't and
01:49 what's strange is people get in these
01:51 ruts where they don't mature and maybe a
01:57 cataclysmic event gets them to mature
02:00 but so often that event whatever it is
02:05 and we'll postulate and I was gonna
02:07 freestyle like I always do you see
02:11 people that don't grow and they keep
02:14 every attribute of their childhood and I
02:19 guess in the case of Michael Jackson we
02:21 can see how under one track how
02:24 dangerous that could be you know if
02:28 you're one that matures and grows up
02:32 and that's a hard thing to define I have
02:34 all episode about growing up which i
02:37 think is measurably gonna be different
02:38 than this episode you grow isolated
02:44 don't you the more I don't know that the
02:50 more that you're less impressed by
02:52 things that are residual patterns of the
02:56 world you seem like you're a sort of a
03:01 Scrooge kind of character people are
03:04 like you know looking around that guy
03:06 because you know nothing he doesn't
03:07 laugh at anything or he doesn't like all
03:09 the goofy movies that I like sort of
03:10 thing let's see you're like yeah amen
03:13 I'm not trying to be you know a debbie
03:17 downer or anything it's just I've seen
03:19 that it seems completely predictable to
03:21 me there's nothing worse than when you
03:25 watch a movie and every single thing
03:27 that happens you're like well I knew
03:29 that was gonna happen
03:30 oh yeah I bet well I bet this gonna oh
03:31 yeah there's that whole thing there's so
03:39 many elements to it right there are so
03:42 many elements to growing up and and
03:45 becoming an adults and this episode is
03:48 gonna be about I would say the younger
03:50 that you are listening to this episode
03:52 and I'll try to keep it relatively clean
03:56 the more that you will make assumptions
03:59 about what's going to happen to you when
04:00 you get older and then there's the
04:02 reality of what happens when you get
04:04 older I remember when I was heavily
04:06 heavy into the Christian Church and this
04:10 was probably from the age of I'd say 18
04:14 to 21 super heavy
04:18 I mean attending church she's four times
04:21 a week living with one of the elder
04:23 families Bible studies everywhere and I
04:26 would hear this these stories about
04:30 being baptized and what supposedly
04:33 happens to you when you're baptized and
04:35 then when I talk to the kids afterwards
04:38 because they get into this kind of again
04:40 group thing kind of thing they they
04:41 don't want to admit it didn't happen
04:46 but what do they tell you I mean certain
04:48 churches are really cool and they don't
04:49 try to program your mind mine was sort
04:52 of like they didn't tell you the elders
04:54 didn't tell you was gonna happen but
04:55 everyone around you told you what was
04:56 gonna happen and so you're kind of like
04:58 well it didn't happen but they said that
05:01 when you were dunked in the water and
05:04 then brought back up my church was a
05:06 non-denominational Church of Christ they
05:10 believed in the full submersion baptism
05:13 I got baptized at 19 in a jacuzzi that
05:16 was in my house like inside the house it
05:19 was a fairly wealthy family it was cool
05:22 I mean it was loving and it was an
05:24 amazing experience I wouldn't take it
05:25 back for anything but I heard these two
05:31 kids talking in the youth group who had
05:32 been baptized several years before and
05:34 they're probably from the age of like 15
05:37 to 17 somewhere in there and they were
05:39 talking to each other they said we can
05:41 no they told me that as soon as I got
05:42 baptized I was gonna get this huge river
05:44 of knowledge from the Holy Spirit but I
05:46 would feel it going in me and that I
05:48 would know right from wrong better and
05:50 then my temptations in themselves would
05:52 be tamed because God would be flowing
05:55 through me all of a sudden but a
05:57 horrific way to describe God well
06:00 there's none in you yet honey
06:01 you get baptized and then it happens
06:04 it's like what anyway but they were
06:09 arguing when they were sorry they
06:10 weren't arguing they were just
06:11 discussing it and that person goes yeah
06:13 I didn't happen for me either
06:14 and of course this broke down their
06:18 trust for their elders somebody kind of
06:23 lied to them given the false hope I mean
06:26 why not it's all kind of hocus-pocus
06:28 anyway
06:31 the parents who were kind of like not
06:33 that mature in terms of how the world
06:36 works how life works they've kind of
06:38 read the Bible but they don't really
06:39 analyze the Bible they don't really look
06:41 at it from a logical way and I'm not
06:42 gonna pick on religion trust me but so
06:45 they they're just kind of worried if
06:46 their kid doesn't get baptized they're
06:48 worried about their kid not going to
06:49 heaven or whatever as if god is that
06:53 intolerant of logic and love but I give
06:58 you the analogy for a reason because
07:00 when we grow up that's kind of what we
07:03 think is going to take place well if I
07:05 get to 20 I'm going to be this mature if
07:07 I get to 30 on that mature I know people
07:10 that every decade they're exactly the
07:14 same from the start of the decade to the
07:16 end of the decade they're immature in
07:19 fact some of them grow worse I've got
07:22 people I know that in fact I've
07:28 definitely got at least one in my family
07:31 that wasn't racist and then became
07:34 racist and why did this person become
07:37 racist because this person grew to
07:38 loathe themselves more and more as they
07:42 realized they had a life full of utter
07:46 chaos they couldn't control anything
07:47 they quit every time something got hard
07:51 and so we can't accomplish anything if
07:53 that's your mantra in life and they're
07:57 not stupid they can look around and see
07:59 the rest of the world succeeding and so
08:04 they grew to demonize other people as to
08:07 their reason I mean it's weird you know
08:09 when you hear racism expressed in the
08:14 coastal region where I live in
08:16 California it's usually just I don't
08:18 like what those people do it's like my
08:20 episode I said we don't really have skin
08:23 racism as much as we have cultural
08:25 racism we just don't know how each other
08:28 behaves and so when we see certain
08:30 behaviors and you know every race has
08:32 its thing and sometimes behaviors are
08:36 attached to races as if this is only
08:38 happens by that race and every race does
08:40 it you know so it's all bs go see my
08:42 episode on that if you like it
08:44 one of the least of you two episodes but
08:47 the really old guard old baby boomer
08:52 guard that manages to either sustain
08:56 racism or gain it over time they
08:59 actually will say things like their life
09:01 isn't good enough or isn't yeah isn't
09:03 great a way they would like it to be
09:05 because of some other outside force
09:07 which is just absurd right it's crazy
09:13 the there's another analogy I'll give
09:17 you which is interesting I help everyone
09:20 I meet who shows exemplary talent in a
09:25 particular area where I have contacts of
09:28 which I could connect them and it goes
09:30 from being a 3d artist a hand artist a
09:33 singer someone who plays an instrument
09:37 they need to be exceptional because just
09:41 farming around a bunch of you know
09:42 above-average players and that's that's
09:45 Moz will just keep going until you get
09:47 to become a mind-blowing five-star
09:50 person you have a voice that's five-star
09:53 and I recently ran into a person like
09:59 this with this amazing voice I mean she
10:02 is unbelievable sweetest thing is gonna
10:04 be she's a model at the same time very
10:07 smart has a great family and I saw her
10:11 singing at karaoke and I said look
10:13 you're amazing what is going on here
10:15 because you have that magic you have
10:17 that Michael Jackson magic the good kind
10:21 and she was like well thank you very
10:22 much and her father's right there and I
10:24 ended up chatting her dad and because I
10:27 said look I'm not gonna talk to you
10:28 you know she's almost 30 years old but I
10:30 said you know you met me in public your
10:33 parents are here so let's keep this all
10:35 and a nice little circle communal
10:37 conversation sign up talking to her dad
10:41 quite a bit and he said something
10:43 interesting he said well I've had a
10:44 we've had a lot of people come up and
10:45 approach her but it's all been for
10:49 nothing
10:49 but no one ever does anything no one
10:51 takes it to the next level so I was like
10:54 okay so then I started talking to her
10:57 and I said
10:57 you know we're gonna have to build some
10:59 sort of portfolio of your capabilities
11:00 because there are a tremendous amount of
11:02 super talented beautiful people in Los
11:04 Angeles you can't quite stick out I mean
11:07 maybe someone sees exactly what I see
11:10 and through various means I've got some
11:14 contacts you know I can push people
11:16 through but they're gonna have to be
11:17 mind blowing it's like Haiti would sit
11:19 out watch this boom and it's like whoa
11:23 all right now you've shown talent I need
11:27 to see you have the discipline a
11:29 properly built portfolio gives complete
11:33 confirmation of the discipline this
11:38 person's very aggressive and she is
11:39 currently working on a portfolio but she
11:41 has a high standard and so she's trying
11:43 to do something that impresses herself
11:44 which hopefully will be a standard high
11:46 enough to impress us and I'm gonna say
11:48 so she is not exactly as impressed as I
11:51 am with her average skills I think she's
11:54 gonna probably have a chance to deliver
11:55 but I told her I said look there's no
11:57 magic bullet here you're gonna have to
12:00 dedicate yourself a hundred percent
12:01 otherwise nothing is going to happen and
12:06 you'll die with this amazing voice and
12:08 no one will have heard it well we will
12:10 have been blessed to hear but that's
12:11 about it so it depends on what you want
12:13 do you want to share your voice with the
12:14 world even want to do this she's past
12:18 that Britney Spears age there's not
12:20 gonna be any tini Bob stuff for early 20
12:22 stuff so it's just got to come in with a
12:24 heavier probably theme to her songs and
12:27 really you know share her soul why
12:32 mention her because that's exactly how
12:35 life works if you don't invest in
12:38 yourself nothing's gonna happen or the
12:42 mundane will simply dominate your life
12:44 and this again doesn't have anything to
12:45 do necessarily with your career it could
12:47 be just your personal maturity there's a
12:53 lot of people who are alone in this
12:54 world and they're convinced right quite
12:58 rightly so but there's someone else out
13:01 there that would probably fall in love
13:03 with them and tolerate every ideo
13:05 secrecy they have properly even love
13:07 their idiosyncrasies and they will never
13:09 be alone again I have to sleep alone be
13:11 a
13:11 whatever but what do you have to do you
13:17 have to go out and meet people don't you
13:19 can't be sitting inside all day and I've
13:23 given several comments on this sort of
13:25 thing over the course of hundreds of
13:27 videos so I think it's time just to go
13:33 head-on with some of this stuff one of
13:38 the most how do I say this one of the
13:43 most debilitating things that can happen
13:49 to you is to have a feeling of no
13:51 purpose you know I've said in several
13:54 episodes self-improvement episodes you
13:58 got to have a project you got to come up
14:00 with a project something that maybe is
14:03 totally outrageous that you think you
14:06 can't do but even just trying it and
14:10 failing it's beautiful because you go oh
14:13 man you know it was like ten steps to
14:16 get from here to there and I thought I
14:19 would only be able to do maybe for one
14:21 or two steps but I did seven even if you
14:25 do one step further than you thought you
14:27 were gonna be able to do you've already
14:28 convinced yourself what you've proven to
14:30 yourself excuse me you get more more
14:34 talent than you then you think you got
14:36 more moxie as they used to say back in
14:38 the day so you can double down replan
14:41 and go again now it's eight steps okay
14:45 yeah it gets a little more difficult
14:47 maybe after seven it just depends you
14:54 know in the show I obviously go for some
14:56 of the most cerebral abstract concepts
14:59 that we could possibly go for I love
15:02 those areas of thinking because their
15:04 areas were very few people have devoted
15:07 any time and some people have again
15:09 devoted so much time to it it is
15:12 mind-blowing and I'm yet to dive into
15:15 this Gurdjieff guy GU Rd je FF r ji e FF
15:24 oh my lord this guy he he was onto
15:29 something I mean I don't know how much I
15:30 agree with his exact conclusions but he
15:33 lays a foundation of paradigm that is
15:40 just exceptional on any level of human
15:43 thinking and we can just pick up his
15:46 book and start reading it you know
15:48 there's people that have done all kinds
15:49 of analyses on it there's colleges and
15:51 schools that teach his stuff and Wow
15:55 who knows you you would be after you
15:57 went in and then popped out or you know
15:59 two years one year or whatever that's
16:02 exciting isn't it but that's a
16:05 super-advanced guy to go into and for
16:08 those of you don't know what I'm talking
16:09 about this gentleman has isolated down
16:13 what he believes to be the building
16:15 blocks of absolute existence from how
16:19 mass from I should say this way the
16:23 physical and metaphysical come together
16:25 he has labeled it he has created
16:27 relationships he's created beautiful
16:30 diagrams and given them almost periodic
16:33 table labeling to see this is how this
16:35 all comes together
16:37 he's also broken it down to an
16:39 evolutionary stage where it was God and
16:42 it was this symbol and then God evolved
16:44 to this stage then that stage then this
16:45 stage and this crazy geometric shape
16:48 starts to evolve and flower out it's
16:51 beautiful well we don't have that one
16:54 we're really young do we then we have
16:58 this disturbing force called the
17:01 preoccupation of survival okay so
17:06 depending on the privilege that you are
17:10 born into meaning you may have very
17:14 supportive parents maybe they're not so
17:16 supportive but they're not against you
17:18 then you have parents that are against
17:19 you then you have no parents and all the
17:21 variations ingredients they're out
17:23 perhaps a parent that you know abuses
17:25 you somehow verbally maybe physically
17:28 now your brain which is this electronic
17:32 box that talks to your soul is now
17:36 preoccupied with the local now
17:38 and so you can't reach through that
17:40 barrier easily unless you decide to and
17:44 this is what this is all about pierced
17:46 through that now bubble of like how do I
17:48 stop getting hit how do I stop getting
17:50 yelled at how do I get some social
17:52 interaction some love that my soul needs
17:55 to survive when I have no access to
17:57 anyone maybe my parents moved me up to
17:59 Alaska
17:59 there's no relatives and they're not
18:01 paying attention to me there's no other
18:02 kids to play with well you get onto
18:05 social media and you try to create a
18:06 relationship out there but those people
18:07 are kind of fake and there's some danger
18:10 you know stranger danger out there so
18:12 you gotta be careful with that I mean
18:14 you wonder why some of these kids grab
18:15 bus tickets from strangers and get
18:18 murdered kidnapped
18:21 I mean imagine a kid who doesn't get
18:24 murdered and kidnapped you know they
18:25 just leave 20 years later they come back
18:28 to their parents oh yeah because they're
18:29 being dicks I'm out of here I was out of
18:31 there see you later you know you know I
18:34 I have a real interesting history with
18:38 this whole thing because again when I
18:41 was a kid my parents were just
18:42 preoccupied with themselves you know up
18:45 till about maybe seven birthday parties
18:48 were fairly well you know orchestrated
18:50 and then they just became yeah there's
18:52 your gifts have a good time see you
18:55 later
18:55 I made you cake go in there get yourself
18:56 a slice you know it wasn't a weren't
18:59 candles and also the crap you know I got
19:00 one other birthday I think when I was 12
19:02 which is sort of awkward because my mom
19:05 wouldn't got one of my old friends that
19:06 I get intentionally not to continue
19:09 talking to and these guys at my party
19:12 and it's just him and his brother and
19:13 like okay this is weird so what happens
19:18 when two moms meet each other out there
19:20 but you know the intentions were great
19:21 so hats off to my mom trying to make
19:23 something wonderful but I had a lot of
19:27 time to myself
19:29 as I've said just recently but I moved
19:33 out of my house at 16 years old
19:36 the catalystic moment that got that to
19:39 occur was my parents my father did
19:43 something very immature he came home and
19:47 in one way or another destroyed a bunch
19:49 of my art
19:50 he had already destroyed a bunch of my
19:52 other stuff intentionally he had the
19:55 subliminal competition with me he had to
19:58 [ __ ] up what I was creating because it
20:00 was obviously hurting his feelings or
20:03 something I don't know what the problem
20:04 was and so I came home and my room was
20:10 clean boy it was so clean and I was like
20:12 all right some of this was okay I've
20:14 told the story once before and then I
20:16 found a bunch of stuff missing my art
20:20 projects I mean like meticulous
20:22 sketching it you know what's strange is
20:26 I left it in the left it where I found
20:28 it I went through these trash bags and
20:30 he had taken a beer bottle collection I
20:33 had put my art on the bottom I mean this
20:35 is like dick move thousand percent put
20:39 my art on the bottom of the trash bag
20:41 dumped all my beer bottles on top of it
20:43 so it's like a big [ __ ] you to your kid
20:49 now he didn't need to [ __ ] with my stuff
20:52 at all did he he just needed to come in
20:54 leave a message
20:56 get your room cleaned up or else none of
21:00 that you just I don't even know I to
21:02 this day I can't imagine what mindset
21:06 this guy was in he was off living with
21:09 his girlfriend at the time so he was
21:11 getting laid all the time should be
21:13 totally chill right she'd just come home
21:15 be like hey man what's going on I used
21:18 to be by myself for a couple years when
21:19 I moved back to Kansas and now I'm
21:21 getting laid he should have been relaxed
21:23 but no he had some weird thing up his
21:25 butt so I left that night call my buddy
21:31 so you're coming to pick me up
21:33 my buddy Todd came out with his truck he
21:38 just he just he just didn't question
21:41 anything I put all my crap in the back
21:43 of his truck and that was it left my dad
21:45 a note with a 357 Magnum on it and don't
21:48 go [ __ ] himself so at that point I had
21:54 this threshold that was met and I wasn't
21:57 going to [ __ ] around anymore I was like
21:59 look you're an [ __ ] you're a [ __ ]
22:02 child I'm sick and tired of living
22:04 if your childish self I'm a 15 I was a
22:07 16 year old kid with more empathy and
22:10 sympathy and awareness then my daddy was
22:14 23 years older than me and is one of
22:18 those dick moves where it was such a
22:19 dick move he's a totally cool dude now
22:24 but he couldn't he couldn't make a big
22:27 fuss about it because the second that I
22:29 told anyone what happened
22:31 he was certified like with a with a
22:34 medallion around his neck that just said
22:36 dick you know and there's nothing he
22:39 could do I wasn't a bad kid and I was
22:43 very very smart at the time I was
22:45 getting amazing grades but that's when I
22:50 you know found out for the second time
22:52 that parents are nothing more older
22:55 people are nothing more than grown-up
22:58 kids that because the shell was getting
23:01 older it didn't mean anything inside was
23:03 getting older you know I saw adults read
23:07 dozens of books but still was immature I
23:10 was like how do you read all those books
23:12 and you'd never gain anything from it
23:15 and it's like watching a hero be strong
23:18 and not taking that strength and making
23:21 it a part of your persona at least if
23:23 you know let alone your character and I
23:27 think it's sort of within at least my
23:29 side of the family you're bred to be
23:32 independent your bred to take care of
23:34 yourself you're bred to know how to cook
23:35 clean you know all the amenities of the
23:39 world taking care of your car outfitting
23:42 your house I mean everything take care
23:44 of your body keep keep yourself
23:46 manicured healthy I'm gonna wash your
23:50 ass it's all taught and then you're to
23:54 be set out on your own so it worked it
23:58 totally works I was ready to go I could
24:00 have moved to California right then and
24:01 there but I needed to finish high school
24:03 first but now what didn't happen to me
24:07 is the preoccupation theory that I'm
24:11 throwing at you earlier which is I
24:12 didn't have to worry you know I mean if
24:18 I was
24:18 is doing something stupid my dad would
24:19 smack me a course right but I didn't
24:23 have to worry about that I could focus
24:24 on my studies I could focus on cuz I
24:27 always had like you know one-third of my
24:29 studies was high school or whatever
24:31 school system I was in two-thirds of my
24:33 studies were my own personal research
24:35 projects how do you program
24:38 how does cosmology work you know how
24:41 does how do physics work what is a
24:42 satanic cult I remember I forgot to
24:44 finish the story in a previous episode
24:45 when I got into the Encyclopedia World
24:48 Encyclopedia
24:49 I'm thumbing through one of the in the S
24:51 book and I saw a pentagram I saw this
24:55 devil crap and it was beautiful diagrams
24:58 in there of all the stuff and of course
24:59 I have no idea what that is and so I'm
25:01 getting into it it didn't appeal to me
25:05 you know but it was just interesting
25:07 there was nothing about secret societies
25:10 or the cults necessarily it was just
25:12 this is the history of these symbols so
25:16 I'm very glad they didn't put anything
25:17 in there that may have you know appealed
25:20 to me as a child that would have been
25:23 really a bad deal but what I'm trying to
25:28 get to what I'm trying to edge at to in
25:31 this sentence with a preposition is that
25:38 you're gonna have to gain a level of
25:39 awareness and again I'm probably
25:40 preaching to the choir but as you take
25:44 on younger kids that need a little bit
25:46 of guidance and they don't seem to have
25:48 a direction they have to know what what
25:53 I tell the people that have a talent is
25:55 to incubate it up to a professional
25:57 level they have to be prolific in it
25:59 they have to be amazing at it because
26:01 the competition now is bigger than it's
26:03 ever been you know we have let's just
26:07 say you were a guy that painted houses
26:08 in Southern California well for every
26:11 house you leave a card out there's an
26:13 illegal immigrant coming up behind you
26:15 that's going to do it for a quarter of
26:17 the price so you'd have to figure out
26:19 how to make that work if you were
26:23 offering services to someone there's
26:26 someone that can email them a promise
26:28 that they can do the same service for
26:31 less and quite frame
26:31 maybe they can they have a slave shop
26:35 across an ocean and they don't even know
26:39 it's a slave shop maybe it's not even a
26:40 slave shot maybe they can just live off
26:42 a dollar a day and you can there's a
26:47 great saying which I love which is life
26:50 is not a rehearsal hmm you if you watch
26:56 my episodes all the way back you'll know
26:57 that I believe in reincarnation I don't
27:02 know what the limits are on that but
27:03 that's what I believe in there's a lot
27:06 of religions that believe that and
27:08 they're based on the ability to remember
27:12 a previous life to explore previous life
27:14 and maybe some of them are bogus I don't
27:18 have any memory of a previous life and I
27:19 still believe that but as I've said in
27:23 several episodes you are who you are
27:26 this time around and I think that it is
27:31 my hunch just having managed several
27:33 people as employees and watched several
27:37 my friends very closely and listened to
27:38 amazing people over the years that
27:44 everyone who tries finds something
27:46 special it could be something as
27:50 incidental as a tiny little hobby their
27:54 collectors or they they just do
27:57 something that no one else gets to enjoy
27:58 it's simply something that's within
28:00 their own little halo but they love it
28:03 it's very rewarding to them it's always
28:05 an adventure every single day that
28:07 adventure happens sometimes it's just a
28:09 relationship with a spouse a partner
28:11 maybe it's a relationship with their kid
28:14 watching their kid grow gives them a
28:16 daily reward I think that's pretty cool
28:20 I've had plenty employees that well I
28:24 have to say I've had some employees all
28:26 my employees I guess because I worked in
28:28 the game industry for almost all of my
28:31 jobs as being a manager and and the
28:35 first group I ever managed was to two
28:38 guys when I was 26 and they were both
28:41 just amazing people before her I ever
28:44 had a chance
28:44 to lead the project that we were on so
28:49 I've been blessed with amazingly
28:50 talented people but when my group grew
28:52 really really large I was finding that
28:56 people had hidden skills hidden
28:59 objectives and no one had ever asked
29:01 them what they want to do with their
29:03 life they came to work and tried to
29:05 retrofit their goals in life with what
29:08 the company was asking them to do and so
29:12 I've reversed that polarity and I would
29:13 sit them down on my one-on-ones and say
29:16 well you know what makes you tick man
29:17 what gets you off and they kind of
29:24 struggle sometimes I said well what do
29:27 you do when you're not here and usually
29:29 they come up with something fairly quick
29:31 and I you have to look at the archetype
29:32 at what turns you on you know you heard
29:36 me say this several times on a lot of
29:37 shows but this is going to get you
29:39 hopefully the traction you know where
29:41 the tires turning on the pavement the
29:43 reason why the tire grips and all the
29:45 sudden that drag race car is going 320
29:48 miles an hour down a straightaway it's
29:51 because you found your purpose now
29:56 sometimes you don't have to have a
29:57 purpose other than to be enlightened to
29:59 grow to see more to explore the universe
30:01 to advance your thinking you buy that
30:04 one book at Barnes & Noble Jean
30:07 Baudrillard book a Marshall McLuhan book
30:10 a gorgeous book and you just you just it
30:16 was like a cage from Tenacious D at the
30:20 the third act of Cable Guy when the when
30:22 the TV went out he reached over and
30:24 grabbed a book and he opened it and we
30:28 got to see his face like oh my god books
30:32 are awesome right I just know my just
30:36 hit the microphone with my cigar so
30:39 pardon me while I realize and wipe the
30:41 ash off my body
30:44 hopefully my microphone has no problem
30:46 taking a lit up its nose hole probably
30:53 the most disruptive thing to a child
30:55 child's development today as a cellphone
31:00 because you know it's easy to say hey
31:03 look we have a bunch of video games now
31:04 the kids play and it destroys their
31:06 lives well we have the Atari 2600 the
31:12 Intellivision the ColecoVision
31:14 eventually the NES then the snez my
31:20 friends to play the crap out of those
31:21 machines were extremely successful now
31:25 the ones that actually grew up prior to
31:27 those machines they actually are the
31:30 superstars that I know the guys that got
31:32 drum sets and guitars and there was
31:35 nothing at home but to get your game
31:37 together sing into a microphone they
31:41 became you know multi-platinum artists
31:45 but I played the crap out of video games
31:48 I played them in the coin op stand up
31:49 games played him at home but what's
31:54 interesting is I don't remember a
31:58 chronic addiction to these things when I
32:00 came home it was there and boy believe
32:02 me you know when you got a new game if
32:03 you're in television television was my
32:05 favorite thing because it was really
32:07 intelligent and now a buddy of mine
32:09 Tommy Tallarico bought the [ __ ]
32:11 company it's awesome he's gonna
32:12 rerelease that platform I still managed
32:16 to get massively educated at the same
32:19 exact time and by having art as my
32:24 primary skill set you know I was I used
32:27 to make money high school either
32:30 painting or drawing people's notebook
32:33 covers was hilarious I think what we're
32:38 talking about in this particular episode
32:39 the myth that we just simply get in more
32:41 intelligent and more enlightened as we
32:43 get older of course you do learn things
32:45 the more you get out into life and
32:47 experience things especially out of your
32:50 home you start to see things better what
32:55 angered you before doesn't anger you
32:57 anymore maybe you find new things to be
32:59 angry about you perhaps were scared when
33:02 you were young and you're no longer as
33:03 scared as you were or you have new
33:06 things to fear
33:10 if you fear something then you have
33:12 something to go and explore because what
33:14 is fear fear is the result of the
33:16 unknown so you have to get informed then
33:21 you're no longer afraid when we're young
33:24 we believe perhaps that there are
33:26 monsters below our bed or in the closet
33:28 you know when you stare at the as you
33:31 stare at the anything in your bedroom at
33:32 night when you were a kid your eyeballs
33:34 are constantly sending electrical
33:37 information back to your visual cortex
33:39 well both mechanisms have a substrate of
33:43 blood and electricity and so as that
33:46 fluctuates as your head lies down in the
33:48 chemistry and balanced inside your skull
33:51 changes things will morph and if you
33:53 take LSD one of the very first things
33:55 you see way before you have any type of
33:57 hallucination this thing starts to kind
33:59 of swim and kind of undulate that's not
34:03 a hallucination that is simply the
34:05 chemicals starting to introduce
34:07 themselves into your visual cortex so
34:13 patterns start to wobble well once you
34:17 start to understand that this happens to
34:19 you at night as a child when you walk
34:22 around your house and naked and there
34:24 with no lights on and you're just trying
34:26 to remember where the furniture is so
34:28 you don't split your foot in half right
34:32 what frustrates me in my circle of life
34:38 because I see it from all different
34:40 regions all different places is the
34:43 concession to failure Wow well I just
34:46 gave up on that you know some people
34:49 will be obese and they'll say well I
34:52 just gave up on trying to be trying to
34:54 be healthy that's for young people and I
34:56 just gave up on that but the second they
34:58 start dying of of you know inflammation
35:01 in their organs or whatever ball they
35:03 want to live don't they and then they
35:05 start eating right and it's way too
35:06 [ __ ] late half the time and so they
35:10 have this rocky you know six million
35:13 dollar man spacecraft nosedive of a
35:17 death which was completely avoidable if
35:22 they would just
35:24 realize that yeah you know what life is
35:26 a battle to the very end and that's
35:28 what's awesome about it ask anybody with
35:31 a Super Bowl ring what it feels like to
35:34 go home after that that game is over
35:38 these individuals have a season of utter
35:42 adrenaline and intention and stress each
35:47 game that they win for the people that
35:49 make it all the way to the Super Bowl
35:51 and win the game they've never lost the
35:53 game all the way up for the most part
35:56 World Series all those championships and
35:59 then they teach themselves that that's
36:02 normal that's gonna happen every single
36:05 time you want to succeed you hunker down
36:08 you make it happen
36:09 well it doesn't have to be the Super
36:10 Bowl it could just be your life it could
36:13 be the very next stage of your life you
36:17 know when I learn screenwriting from
36:21 Robert McKee he teaches us about the
36:25 maturation script which is a script
36:27 where the character matures over the
36:29 course of the script obviously another
36:31 way of looking at as they become
36:32 enlightened and then becoming more
36:34 empowered in their life all the mistakes
36:36 that were part of their character starts
36:38 to bleed away because they start to do
36:40 trial and error so much that by the last
36:43 scene in the third act the hero is
36:46 triumphant over their obstacle and
36:49 therefore it is a Greek comedy and we
36:52 all feel awesome when we leave and go
36:54 back to our cars and hopefully if we're
36:56 paying attention to the film and it was
36:58 well-written we were having an amazing
37:00 conversation all the way home until you
37:02 lay your head on your pillow sometimes I
37:05 watch people watch movies and there'll
37:09 be a beautifully written film or
37:12 something really cathartic takes place
37:16 it would be a situation under any
37:18 circumstance if the human being has a
37:20 pulse
37:21 they should be tearful choked up a
37:25 little bit and sometimes I watch people
37:28 go through the proper emotions you know
37:33 there's people that have been through
37:34 these arcs before in real life and so
37:36 it's nothing special to them and they
37:37 don't have
37:37 any tearful moments but I see people
37:39 that have experienced very little in
37:41 life certain in certain areas watch of
37:43 movie and there's nothing it's as if
37:47 they're just sort of a zombie watching a
37:49 movie and it pains me because I'm
37:52 sitting there going wow you're getting
37:54 nothing from this beautiful work of art
37:56 where this would normally inspire
37:58 thousands of people to maybe go home and
38:01 think things out and maybe take a
38:03 challenge and build a plan to do
38:06 something they're getting nothing from
38:07 it it's strange and then you ask them
38:11 well have you ever seen a movie that
38:13 ever made you cry oh yeah and it's like
38:16 Oh Legally Blonde you know or whatever
38:18 be some like movie that's just
38:20 ridiculous with no no intent of
38:23 embedding in the movie any type of
38:25 maturation plot as much as I'm no longer
38:30 a fan of Robert De Niro because of his
38:32 workings with a satanic Church of the
38:36 Spirit cooking woman he did make a movie
38:40 called The Awakening and if you're
38:44 looking for a story that shows you the
38:48 value of life you know this isn't a
38:51 movie he wrote he just portrayed the
38:53 main character brilliantly and then you
38:56 have Rahm Williams on that on the the
38:59 contrasting side being his doctor trying
39:01 to keep him awake and it's about a kid
39:03 who it's a real it's a true story of a
39:05 guy that was in a coma I think Toby's
39:07 about I want to say in his late 20s but
39:10 De Niro was obviously older than that in
39:12 the film so I'm not quite sure what the
39:13 age was but he was under for a really
39:15 long time it's this weird side effect of
39:17 another illness where he kind of goes
39:19 comatose but he's given a experimental
39:23 magic medication regiment and he wakes
39:25 up and he's fine he's completely fine he
39:30 can talk he's mechanically fine he goes
39:33 out and he explores I think it's New
39:35 York City and it goes on for quite a
39:39 while he gets a couple weeks of just
39:41 blissful existence he ends up taking
39:44 risks that no one would normally take
39:47 because he's like I know what it's like
39:48 to be off like a [ __ ] robot just
39:50 sitting in a bed being
39:51 off and then as the the second act
39:58 matures if you want to go with a three
40:00 act play format he starts to lose his
40:04 mechanical coordination and so Robin
40:07 Williams is on the backside continually
40:09 doubling and tripling and quadrupling
40:11 the medication because the brain is
40:13 automatically sort of you know becoming
40:16 immune to the medication so his
40:18 stabilization mechanism isn't working
40:20 anymore and de niro does this amazing
40:22 job portraying this character shakin
40:24 like a leaf and trying to see the
40:26 positive and all of it was his funny
40:29 house seeing where he's brushing his
40:31 teeth and he's shakin like he's
40:33 Parkinson's disease sort of it's not
40:35 Parkinson's but it's like that and he
40:37 says you know this actually became
40:38 helpful in brushing my teeth because he
40:40 just shakes automatically just get the
40:41 brush in his mouth and it all goes
40:43 automatically it's really funny but
40:46 eventually his character isn't going to
40:49 be able to hang on to it and he's kind
40:52 of gone rogue he's kind of become a
40:54 dangerous character in the mental
40:56 institution that he's been placed in I
41:01 don't know how much of the second part
41:03 of the story is true but he sort of
41:04 takes over the hospital and becomes sort
41:06 of like this he takes over one of the
41:07 rooms and he's got people that are loyal
41:09 to him who were kind of insane and so
41:12 they can't quite approach him as easily
41:13 as they used to without causing a scene
41:15 but he gets angry because he's like all
41:18 of you are alive and you're not living
41:19 your lives and if anything you should be
41:22 able to look at my experience and
41:24 realize you're pissing away your lives
41:27 being alive is the most amazing gift we
41:31 have in this universe so don't sit
41:33 around and treat it like it's some
41:37 secondary attribute of your existence
41:42 and then eventually he goes back to
41:46 comatose when I first saw that movie I
41:49 could not hang on to my waterworks man
41:52 it hit me so hard because he was right
41:56 and Here I am a kid who's taking
42:00 advantage of every second I've been
42:02 alive I mean I
42:03 fortunate was getting opportunities but
42:04 I also went out and even got them you
42:06 know I said I'm not sitting here in the
42:08 Midwest with all these skills that are
42:10 gonna be great use in a big city and so
42:14 I left and I got those careers and I got
42:16 all this stuff done it's great but even
42:20 with all of those accomplishments I
42:21 probably saw it in my late 20s it was
42:24 already way through the theater by that
42:25 time I think but I doubled down on my
42:32 life after seeing that movie it shook me
42:35 to my core
42:36 and I loved that absolutely loved that
42:39 and there are a few movies that will do
42:42 this from time to time they'll take on
42:44 that live theme you earn your adulthood
42:51 you earn it it costs really nothing more
42:57 than your time and effort as I'm redoing
43:04 season one it's becoming painfully
43:07 apparent that you know most of them are
43:10 self-improvement at least a good half of
43:14 them are self-improvement and they're
43:15 barely watched and I'm not saying I'm
43:17 the best resource quite frankly but it
43:22 strikes me as weird that a lot of these
43:25 episodes I put together are sort of what
43:28 I see wrong with society where they
43:29 where society struggles and society is
43:31 unhappy that's why I say wrong you know
43:35 I converse with young people all the
43:37 time students and what-have-you and
43:39 there they're telling me their fears and
43:41 their anxieties and the second I get to
43:47 talk to them and we have a good
43:48 one-on-one session they immediately know
43:51 what to do and they take action and but
43:53 all those things have been stuffed in
43:54 videos and they're not being watched in
43:56 some kind of like damn that sucks had a
43:59 way wideness this field of absorption
44:05 it's probably just the native
44:08 incompatibility I have with the masses
44:11 or something I don't know
44:13 and I think it's all simple stuff stage
44:17 one things for all of his bourbon
44:23 drugging and roofie raping Bill Cosby
44:28 did have an episode I think I mentioned
44:31 this one time a long time ago in season
44:33 one where he made an episode where he
44:37 became the teacher of his oldest son in
44:40 The Cosby Show which was obviously one
44:42 of these things that they played it up
44:43 like it was really embarrassing but
44:46 Cosby most likely participated in the
44:48 theme of this particular episode because
44:50 it sort of echoed his entire mantra of
44:53 life when I saw him take on issues with
44:56 the ghettos because he was extremely
44:59 frustrated with a bunch of stuff in the
45:02 Bay Area because Oakland which is sort
45:04 of this testing ground for the Democrats
45:06 they were trying to formalize Ebonics so
45:08 the kids would speak you know
45:10 horribly broken English and be told that
45:13 it was like a tribal thing you know this
45:15 is because you're black you speak like
45:17 this and it's like they didn't speak
45:19 like this in Africa trust me so they
45:22 wanted kids to defend illiteracy it's
45:26 like okay well you can defend that all
45:28 you want but you guys better learn how
45:29 to create super computers all by
45:31 yourself because you're gonna have to
45:32 employ yourselves with all this broken
45:34 English and you have to learn how to
45:36 communicate technically and accurately
45:38 to manage projects with broken English
45:40 is never gonna work you're gonna have to
45:43 increase your vocabulary why wouldn't
45:44 you want to why wouldn't you want to
45:46 vocabulary or five to ten thousand words
45:48 as opposed to the average you know
45:50 privileged white kid who gets out with
45:52 1200 words why not blow these kids away
45:55 and of course that happens all the time
45:57 all over the place but in this
45:59 particular episode what he said well
46:02 what they what they did was the
46:03 orchestrated a classroom where he
46:05 quickly got on to the subject of asking
46:07 kids about their goals in life and he
46:09 said what would you like to be what
46:10 would you like to be would you like to
46:11 be and he said okay you guys have some
46:16 great ideas love it you all should stick
46:18 to those ideas but he doesn't know how
46:19 do you get a career to work and this
46:23 works for anything life
46:25 he says we've got to determine how many
46:27 steps it takes from where you are today
46:30 to where you're going and then just do
46:34 the steps and yeah you're gonna find out
46:36 that maybe one of the steps doesn't even
46:38 exist and one of the steps that you
46:40 thought was one step turns into four
46:42 steps okay you just update your little
46:44 manifest on how to get there realize
46:47 you're gonna get a little a little bit
46:49 of a delay today but again you might
46:51 actually start catching on and digest
46:52 you know where it took you a whole did
46:55 either to do one step or a week to do
46:56 one step
46:57 geez maybe there's an hour real nail ten
47:00 steps because you're starting to catch
47:01 on maybe you know it's like when you
47:03 when you get into mathematics you
47:08 usually have a point when you're
47:09 completely confused and then once it
47:12 clicks you can do infinite problems
47:15 forever and it's instantaneous it's just
47:18 a matter of going through the ritual of
47:19 doing all your subdivision
47:21 simplification whatever the hell you're
47:22 doing life masters us first and then we
47:27 master life never forget that there's a
47:33 lot of folks that get older and they
47:35 worry about their intelligence like I
47:37 said in a previous episode and you
47:40 really don't have to worry about that
47:41 kind of stuff don't worry about it if
47:43 you think you are lacking knowledge in
47:47 an area that what otherwise benefits you
47:50 if you had that knowledge to just go get
47:51 it when I was a kid you had very limited
47:55 resources you had limited teachers you
47:58 could get access to and limited books
48:00 you could get access to but today we've
48:02 got YouTube I mean like I've said a
48:05 million times on this show if you want
48:07 to do something and figure out how to do
48:08 something
48:09 pull that subject up in YouTube there's
48:12 gonna be let's say you find 20 videos on
48:15 something you want to learn how to do
48:16 maybe it's wood carving car a carpentry
48:18 fixing cars whatever it is fixing
48:20 exactly a specific car 19 of the videos
48:25 will have a person that is just horrible
48:27 at teaching you know just be like oh my
48:29 gosh this person doesn't know how to
48:30 speak English very well or whatever
48:32 language you speak they drone on they're
48:34 slow and so you just go - thanks video
48:37 go
48:38 but one out of twenty most likely less
48:40 than that it's gonna be someone exactly
48:42 like you they're talking about the same
48:45 pace that your mind thinks they use the
48:48 same vocabulary that is completely
48:49 accessible to your mind so whatever
48:51 they're saying you completely understand
48:52 it and you're ready for the next thing
48:54 and it's a video you get confused you
48:56 rewind it tonight I was doing some video
49:00 editing and I needed to shroud a piece
49:02 of the video in like that that blurred
49:05 type of video
49:07 well I'd ever had that requirement
49:08 before from any of my clients this is a
49:10 personal project of mine I said just
49:13 went to YouTube looked it up Final Cut
49:15 Pro X blurring face her face that's what
49:20 I looked up mine isn't a face mine's
49:22 just a piece of an interface the only
49:23 one to see the password is being typed
49:25 in her how many you know the username I
49:27 mean that kind of stuff so I blocked it
49:28 out I just did now I know how to do that
49:33 for the rest of my life if it were a
49:35 parable written by Christ it would be I
49:38 know how to catch my own fish and make
49:39 my own bread it's a beautiful thing now
49:41 and now I could make it for everybody
49:43 else I almost want to say in closing
49:46 that the myth is that you do get older
49:52 maybe you get older
49:58 now sometimes there are behaviors that
50:00 are construed into aging that have
50:04 nothing to do with really what you're
50:06 interested in sometimes the person is
50:12 simply too talkative like Run DMC said
50:15 you talk too much
50:17 eight days a week 13 months out of the
50:20 year and you just need to calm down
50:22 you know you need to realize that around
50:24 you people don't want to don't to listen
50:26 to your voice that much and maybe they
50:29 don't want to listen to your voice
50:30 because maybe what you have to say isn't
50:32 that interesting
50:35 you know that people go to see gurus
50:37 talk for six hours straight they stay at
50:39 their their little um you know resorts
50:43 and listen to them for a week or a month
50:44 and they're not talking at all fact the
50:47 rule is sit down and shut up and listen
50:49 my stream running teacher Robert McKee
50:52 it's like ten to twelve hour days four
50:54 days in a row you got to be there right
50:57 on time otherwise they don't allow you
50:58 in the room and he talks and you can
51:03 only remotely talk during the class if
51:07 he is asking a question and he's looking
51:09 for a few hands and it's a very short
51:10 little spurt of him trying to get
51:13 feedback from the class and the rest of
51:15 its just sit and listen and believe me
51:18 the entire time I'm sitting there
51:20 because I love screenwriting
51:21 he's like the Messiah of screenwriting
51:25 education all right well if you're a
51:29 person who really loves social
51:30 interaction that's your game that's what
51:31 you need well then take something that's
51:35 unique to you get super educated on it
51:38 learn all sides of the arguments that
51:40 might be posed and maybe you become a
51:44 teacher maybe just have a nice sort of
51:46 weapon or in your back in the back of
51:49 your mind such that when it comes up in
51:50 average conversation you leap in if
51:53 you're talking to another human being
51:54 perhaps you need to be a better listener
51:57 perhaps you're a great listener and you
51:59 need to flip it and become a better
52:00 participant but don't we have things
52:04 where we test ourselves we have goals
52:08 for ourselves
52:09 sometimes we make goals for ourselves
52:11 that are sort of intangible if I give
52:15 you an example I'll give you a tangible
52:17 example and I'll give you an intangible
52:19 example you want to become a great chef
52:22 for your family and for yourself for
52:25 your loved one and you don't know how to
52:27 cook but you love cooking and so you go
52:29 and buy a bunch of ingredients you
52:30 bought you watch a ton of YouTube videos
52:32 and on the things that you want to eat
52:35 you bring it home you experiment you
52:37 succeed you fail but you do learn and
52:42 it's just like art the more you do it
52:44 the better you get
52:45 period artist one of the greatest things
52:47 because you will get better the more you
52:49 try period but then on the flip side and
52:53 intangible would be you want to be the
52:56 perfect parent you go read a bunch of
52:59 parenting books you talk to a bunch of
53:00 people maybe watch a bunch of YouTube
53:02 videos whatever it is I've got a episode
53:05 on parenting it might help any of you
53:07 trying to get around some of the formal
53:09 education that doesn't work real well
53:12 but your kid is their own being now
53:17 let's say you don't vaccinate your kids
53:18 screw up the brain you feed them great
53:20 food so they grow up nice and healthy
53:22 but they're still their own being and so
53:28 you're trying to manage someone else's
53:29 expectations someone else's behavior and
53:32 eventually they're going to go off on
53:34 their own and unless it is your goal and
53:37 understanding that this occurs at this
53:39 phantom moment in time which we call the
53:41 rite of passage where they begin to
53:44 reject all of your advice simply because
53:46 it's their time to take over it's
53:49 nothing personal it's gonna feel
53:50 personal it could be even offensive and
53:53 hurtful you could feel like crap for a
53:56 week a month but it wasn't that way at
54:00 all so your goal may be less tangible at
54:04 certain points so what school is the
54:08 most tangible thing that you can modify
54:10 and control is yourself if you become
54:15 happy and successful maybe by your own
54:18 definition don't worry about anyone
54:19 else's definition hopefully you're a
54:22 productive
54:23 of society and you're not some freak
54:25 doing you know Ted Bundy crap you will
54:30 be amazed how many people are attracted
54:32 to you all the sudden your kids will
54:34 start being proud of you if they aren't
54:36 already proud of you people will be
54:40 gravitating towards you because you sort
54:41 of have this aura around you of success
54:47 now sadly there are some things that are
54:53 just fascinating with those algorithms
54:56 sometimes you can sit down with someone
54:58 have a great conversation and they'll
55:00 just accept you but then you go outside
55:03 and you get inside of a 20 year old car
55:05 and you drive away and they're like whoa
55:08 did that person just get in that old
55:09 rust bucket yeah I don't know why drives
55:12 that car well maybe I don't have the
55:16 impression I thought I had of that
55:18 person they started downgrading you now
55:20 it's obviously their problem what's
55:23 strange in society is that if you were
55:27 to get into a super fancy car all the
55:30 sudden regardless of what you said if
55:33 you're well kept I guess you know you're
55:34 a big bum walking into a Lamborghini
55:37 it's gonna make everybody go whoa whoa
55:38 no what's going on there I think it's
55:39 probably trust fund kid oh yeah probably
55:41 whatever if you talk to them in your
55:43 intelligent and you get in a fancy car
55:44 oh my god the illusion is complete in
55:49 their mind for some reason it's a weird
55:52 thing so you do have this superficial
55:56 layer on society which is why I super
56:00 suggest you pick really good friends
56:03 around you people get into who you are
56:05 as a person if a social element is part
56:10 of your goal and here's what's
56:13 interesting is it possible to create a
56:17 litmus test like a Turing test right for
56:20 a human being to prove that a human
56:22 being has achieved adulthood hmm I think
56:29 the knee-jerk reaction would be sure but
56:33 I think the truth is not really
56:37 and why is that because only we know who
56:42 we really are if we're being honest with
56:44 ourselves who are we inside what makes
56:48 us tick do we have frailties we're not
56:50 willing to tell anyone I think the
56:52 answer is always yes because the idea is
56:55 well I'm gonna try to conquer that
56:57 before I ever have to admit it it'll be
57:01 a battle maybe for a decade and then you
57:04 conquer that one thing and then maybe
57:06 you wake up one daniel like you know i
57:07 can't really think of anything that i
57:09 can't do that i wish i could do and
57:12 that's when you hit a beautiful sweet
57:13 spot and hopefully you can hang on to
57:15 that for the rest of your life does that
57:18 old saying the ignorance is bliss and I
57:21 will tell you that that is 100% true I'm
57:23 not sure it's how productive that is in
57:25 life depending on our society needs to
57:27 have your help from time to time but it
57:30 is true I see it all the time I know
57:35 I've been referencing the matrix a lot
57:37 in recent episodes but I find this
57:41 correlation this analogy Laura Leigh
57:43 shaniyah coming out of the virtual
57:46 reality matrix he was in into that sort
57:49 of got off a world that was reality and
57:53 that is the analogy of becoming woke
57:59 isn't it you pop out of the illusion
58:03 that you have freedom you pop out of the
58:05 illusion that the American Dream still
58:08 exists or whatever country you live in
58:10 what if you were promised as a kid that
58:13 if you work hard you do this and you do
58:14 that you'll have this much money in the
58:16 bank and this much security in your life
58:18 this much love around you and you find
58:21 out society programs whatever person
58:24 you're interested in into potentially
58:26 the most shallow crap on planet Earth
58:28 and you're like well don't you want to
58:32 be loved what oh yeah sure and whatever
58:34 yeah sure don't you love me all right
58:36 yeah sure let's go do this now like wow
58:40 maybe not I said it a long time ago and
58:45 I'll say it again
58:48 as a male that's over 40 I have seen a
58:53 tremendous trend trend that is I'm not
59:00 sure how to put it into words it's it's
59:03 it's not actually fear but it's sad and
59:08 that is as a male if you have some
59:15 outward communication with society and
59:18 especially if you're not lying about who
59:19 you are but it probably even worse if
59:21 you lied about who you are meaning all
59:23 of your posts on social media are
59:24 promoting a bunch of things that isn't
59:26 there aren't really a part of your life
59:27 you're only posting these little
59:29 highlighted events that almost never
59:31 occur and everyone thinks that that's
59:32 the bubble you live in but even you know
59:35 it's even more I think I don't see
59:39 alarming because that's just the wrong
59:40 word but it's like oh my gosh really
59:42 this is occurring is that I have been
59:47 approached by several females that are
59:51 hitting forty-five or above and they are
59:55 realizing that there's a game of sort of
59:58 you know it's it's it's sort of the
60:02 byproduct of the feminist movement where
60:06 women were told you know screw your man
60:08 get out there on your own and become
60:10 your own woman and get your own job and
60:12 become totally dependent on your
60:14 personal income and then they realize if
60:17 they lose their job at forty five or
60:18 above getting a new job is not fun
60:22 depending on your skill sets but you
60:24 could be extremely skilled and someone
60:27 will just do age discrimination who
60:30 knows the world also teaches them well
60:34 it teaches the guys to be shallow and
60:35 that if a woman doesn't look a
60:37 particular way don't ever consider her
60:39 she's had a couple kids and so her body
60:41 isn't absolutely smooth and perfect so
60:43 why why why date that why not date the
60:47 super smooth girl who never had any kids
60:49 or have kids super early in her life and
60:51 her body completely snapped back into
60:53 place they teach the women to self
60:56 loathe will put more makeup on put more
60:59 makeup on go get us some plastic surgeon
61:02 if you don't do either one of those two
61:04 well just feel bad about yourself and so
61:08 there becomes this desperate race
61:10 between 45 and 50 really 40 and 50 to
61:13 get a man get that locked down guess
61:17 it's only gonna get worse from here
61:20 unfortunately there's potentially a lot
61:22 of truth with that and once you realize
61:25 someone's approaching you from that
61:27 level of insecurity you might actually
61:29 really like the person but you're sort
61:32 of put off by the urgency to slam the
61:38 two of you together as quickly as
61:39 possible to plan the whole future out as
61:42 quickly as possible
61:45 and what would happen to that kind of
61:47 race it's the hunt as soon as the ring
61:52 goes on divorce is now a penalty they
61:59 don't have to behave you don't have to
62:01 behave because men do it too I'm not
62:05 putting this all in women one of the
62:09 most attractive things that I can hear
62:11 from a female is that she has spent some
62:15 time by herself how much time a year two
62:19 years or more because that means that
62:23 they've had a time in their life where
62:25 they had to look in the mirror they were
62:28 their own hero they were their only hero
62:31 but they could pay attention to their
62:34 parents I was gonna tell you're
62:35 beautiful or handsome or whatever your
62:37 close friends may say something positive
62:40 but they're not the ones you're gonna
62:41 date they're not the ones you're gonna
62:42 marry and so if you end up being
62:45 comfortable in your own skin while being
62:48 independent
62:49 you really are more ready to be with
62:53 another human being because in the end
62:55 you have to be complete by yourself
62:57 first before you can ever consider this
63:01 you know you complete me I want to say
63:05 horseshit I mean it's really that there
63:07 is a completion if you are a Qingyang I
63:11 want to be with somebody I don't want to
63:13 be alone
63:14 algorithm it's true but that's a
63:18 separate thing you're becoming you have
63:20 to be the caterpillar first completely
63:22 content running around chewing on leaves
63:24 before you cocoon yourself and try to
63:27 become a butterfly which may be the
63:29 analogy for being a couple the older
63:33 that I get and this this does apply to
63:37 men too from time to time but it's most
63:39 often for the woman for the woman a
63:42 woman that has to raise some kids and
63:46 for whatever reason finds herself single
63:48 at the end sometimes they're single
63:49 during the process and they will you
63:55 know I will date them or whatever and
63:56 they'll you know make fun of their body
63:59 well you know my tummy isn't what it
64:01 used to be because I had some kids and
64:03 they're kind of like down on the subject
64:04 and trying to sort of prime the pump so
64:07 the one I see them in a bathing suit or
64:09 whatever I'm not disappointed and
64:15 nowadays I figured out because I always
64:17 had struggled with that I was like I
64:18 don't feel bad about that I didn't know
64:22 how to articulate it back to the woman
64:23 and so finally I figured out a way to
64:24 tell him I said look there's nothing
64:27 more amazing than a woman who's had
64:29 children and raised them as best she can
64:31 and again you can't blame a woman for
64:34 all their kids idiosyncrasies and
64:36 nowadays because the kids are absolutely
64:37 attacked from the moment they're alive
64:40 but just like a guy coming back from war
64:43 who might have some scars and and he
64:47 celebrated at the bar he's like my
64:49 bullet wound this is where just guy cut
64:50 my face and it's it's a masculine thing
64:53 it's an augmentation it's proof that he
64:56 was a hero or he's willing to seek a
64:58 pible and willing to sacrifice his life
65:01 for the betterment of something else or
65:03 to save someone's life the change in a
65:08 woman's body as a results of giving life
65:10 should be something that we celebrate a
65:14 woman was willing to sacrifice her youth
65:17 in a way that pristine body to bring
65:22 more life into our world I mean what are
65:24 we were human beings we have to
65:26 procreate otherwise we cease to be
65:28 and the burden is on the back of the
65:30 woman it's almost a trophy of sorts the
65:37 woman that's never had any kids nothing
65:40 against anyone like that but they are
65:44 the trophy for some guy who's leaving
65:46 his wife and that's the way they say it
65:47 these days right I think that particular
65:52 epiphany is a sign of maturity it's a
65:57 sign of earning your adulthood that we
66:00 respect each other for the sacrifices
66:02 that we make I have good friends that
66:07 are in their mid 80s right now very good
66:10 friends and they're getting older and
66:13 their bodies are ceasing to work like
66:15 they used to they get sick easier one of
66:23 my close friends keeps tabs on what it's
66:27 like to get older and he tells me he
66:29 goes you know you know it's a hell of a
66:31 thing to get older you have to be very
66:33 brave to get older to lose your
66:36 faculties your physical faculties and
66:38 eventually your mental faculties and
66:41 this man is an absolute genius by any
66:43 definition proven I am several decades
66:50 away from that phase in my life but
66:53 because of him sharing his epiphanies
66:56 and realizations I am more prepared now
67:00 for when it occurs I will be less
67:02 depressed or less disappointed in fact I
67:05 may see it as an adventure oh wow it's
67:07 crazy man I can't stand up easily
67:09 anymore I was trying to remember
67:11 something and it didn't come to me as
67:13 easily I just crapped my pants my intent
67:19 in life and getting older is to try and
67:23 obviously build some sort of nest egg
67:25 and security for myself so I can enjoy
67:27 that process a little bit easier but I
67:32 want to slow down my life I'm going to
67:33 live in a slower area of the world when
67:36 I get to that stage
67:39 I want to reduce the amount of demands I
67:42 have on myself and sort of just enjoy
67:46 perhaps the house I've built which would
67:49 be my life my circle of friends I never
67:54 want to stop producing until the last
67:56 minute but maybe what I do is I say look
67:59 I can no longer sing like Robert Plant
68:02 and so I will listen to proverbs else
68:07 that's um productive for me if you have
68:14 any one your life that you admire is
68:16 older than you who seems like they have
68:19 beautifully achieved maturity female
68:22 male and you could be the opposite sex
68:24 with the same sex keep them in your life
68:28 keep them in your circle of life engage
68:30 them more perhaps you know someone that
68:31 has always impressed you but you never
68:34 open your mouth to talk to them well do
68:37 yourself a favor and go tell them that
68:41 tell them you know look I have never
68:44 really spoken to you but I just need to
68:47 tell you look you're truly inspiring to
68:51 me I was able to do this with one of my
68:54 dad's friends and I was able to do it in
68:58 front of his wife and his daughter it
69:00 was beautiful and he was shocked he was
69:04 utterly shocked it's probably one other
69:07 dude I need to do that with as well but
69:10 I told you guys a long time ago honest
69:11 in a story I bought my life that my
69:14 father had this guy's still alive doing
69:17 well he had this buddy his was a little
69:19 bit younger than my dad definitely older
69:21 than me but he's just one with the
69:22 coolest dudes on planet Earth he and
69:24 Billy Dee Williams could totally hang
69:26 out together and they would be the two
69:28 coolest guys in the room but he always
69:31 saw the world and sees the world today
69:33 in a light his cup is always overflowing
69:36 no matter what's going on his life he's
69:39 guy does tend to fall up every single
69:41 day of his life
69:42 hopefully he's retired by now but I was
69:47 over at his house probably about 15
69:50 Nettie's
69:52 maybe about 10 years ago as a matter of
69:54 fact and it just it just happens so that
69:57 I was over at his house he just saw me
69:59 with my girlfriend he's like it why
70:01 don't you guys come over and I'm like
70:01 great yeah sure I'll go over there I
70:03 think even my daughter was with me at
70:05 the time but I sat down and I talked to
70:09 him and I I just said I need to tell you
70:11 something man I said when I was a kid I
70:14 super looked up to you I didn't see that
70:16 often but every time I saw you have to
70:20 handle someone you know your engagement
70:23 at a party or something like that
70:25 picnic whatever it was you were just the
70:27 coolest guy on planet earth and I I have
70:30 forever tried to emulate she was best I
70:32 came with a handful of communications
70:36 that I had with you or moments where I
70:38 watched you do what you did and the guy
70:41 was so humble
70:42 he was shocked because he just didn't
70:44 imagine that that would ever occur and
70:46 I'm glad that his daughter got to see
70:47 that who I think was about 14 at the
70:49 time and because she got to see that you
70:53 know if if we'll put this way I was very
70:56 successful at the time so maybe that
70:59 added to the comment to say look I've
71:03 never had a problem succeeding in life
71:04 and also this stuff is still you or one
71:06 of the dudes that if I have any level of
71:08 coolness on this planet you can own half
71:10 of it if not more because you're that
71:13 guy and that was a dude who probably has
71:18 a completely different belief system for
71:19 me than me but he affected me and so
71:23 what I've done is I've taken the things
71:25 from him that I like and I try to put
71:27 them in myself
71:28 I'm almost genetically predisposition to
71:32 be the opposite of him because the way I
71:34 was raised
71:35 it's a little bit different being very
71:36 aggressive and and critical of all
71:39 things I don't want any of you to
71:42 struggle with life I mean I shouldn't
71:46 say that I mean I want you to have
71:48 rewarding struggles in life you know go
71:50 get your goals and you know if you got a
71:52 goal really quickly and easily I
71:54 guarantee you you won't go for a second
71:56 round
71:57 most likely unless it's winning the
71:58 lottery it is that difficulty and
72:04 overcoming the obstacles
72:05 makes you feel wonderful at the end of
72:07 the day when you go to bed let's say had
72:09 a project that took a year to complete
72:11 and so every single day is a little
72:13 struggle but you know if you move the
72:14 ball for just a little bit eventually
72:16 there's gonna be a touchdown it's just
72:17 math as Cosby said the steps you got to
72:22 take the steps and just be willing to
72:24 continue taking the steps and don't
72:25 think at any point in time but just
72:28 because it got hard you should quit I
72:31 mean even if you stalled for several
72:34 days or weeks you had writer's block of
72:36 a certain analogy just keep thinking
72:39 about it until it clicks because it will
72:41 click just like that math problem you
72:43 couldn't figure out you take calculus
72:44 you ever take calculus it seems like
72:47 gobbly coop at first I mean you can
72:49 understand the objective of your
72:52 calculus equation but how to get to work
72:54 sometimes it doesn't click and then also
72:55 hadn't pow it's easy for the rest of
72:59 your life and you just put that in your
73:05 quiver as an arrow I need some calculus
73:07 that's simple right
73:09 Napoleon was a genius of calculus that's
73:12 why he was a great artillery general
73:14 it's how he got famous that could be you
73:19 with whatever you're trying to do you
73:24 have to actively participate in becoming
73:27 an adult otherwise you don't become one
73:29 and that's the myth that that's what the
73:32 myth doesn't tell you the myth is a lie
73:37 there's gonna come automatically sure
73:40 you'll learn a bunch of stuff you gain a
73:42 bunch of wisdom that [ __ ] that shinola
73:45 that's not the complete picture in the
73:49 end everything that you figure out gives
73:51 you control of your life of how you
73:55 interact with other people of how you're
73:58 perceived by other people isn't
74:01 interesting when you know there I
74:02 mentioned the Ted Bundy series I think
74:04 it's on Netflix to the Netflix yeah has
74:07 to be def likes the guy's a stone-cold
74:10 killer
74:12 the worst he gets right what's amazing
74:17 about that guy is that he had this
74:21 persona that he used he learned how to
74:23 use his powers for bad he manipulated
74:27 people he manipulated the police he
74:29 escaped from prison several times he
74:32 manipulated his victims I don't mean
74:35 getting this on a bad note but we're
74:36 gonna flip this to the last second we
74:39 want the opposite effect of our power
74:42 don't we when you look at these mad
74:47 geniuses you go look how's this guy able
74:50 to figure out all this crap to do all
74:52 this horrible stuff and I can't figure
74:54 out how to balance my checkbook I can't
74:56 figure out how to get my kid to listen
74:58 to me my advice to you is to start as
75:08 soon as you possibly can for the things
75:10 you think you're going to incur in life
75:13 too many parents wait till their
75:15 children start misbehaving to ever be a
75:17 parent and so I have this thing I tell
75:21 people don't tell them to their face I
75:22 tell it to someone who's with me
75:23 watching this horrible event happen in a
75:25 restaurant but they got their kids you
75:26 know that are children running around a
75:30 restaurant it you know 11 o'clock at
75:31 night feeding them cake and a bunch of
75:33 sugar so when they get him home it's
75:34 gonna be another 3 hours before the kids
75:36 are capable of being quiet in their
75:38 bedroom and I just turned it you know
75:40 usually the girlfriend of mine I'll say
75:42 look they're trying to start parenting
75:45 really late and the kids getting
75:46 punished and yelled at and spanked and
75:49 all this other stuff and it's like it's
75:51 because you started too late I mean
75:53 there's nothing like the present you're
75:54 gonna have to start it at some point
75:56 but the level of communication that's
75:58 going to be required to gain control
76:00 over the kid is gonna have to be
76:01 extensive and your kid may not
76:04 understand this new introduction of
76:05 rules because you're just suddenly
76:07 spawning rules go see my episode on
76:12 parenting if you're having parenting
76:14 issues but we have to parent ourselves
76:18 don't we that's what this whole game is
76:22 now don't be don't be bashful about
76:26 creating goals for yourself in the
76:29 maturity realm because a lot of times we
76:33 can sense what's wrong with ourselves
76:35 what we don't write it down we don't
76:37 tell anybody we don't make it an
76:39 objective we just kind of wince and
76:41 cringe like oh I did that again I think
76:46 I said it you know maybe I don't know a
76:48 couple dozen episodes back maybe in the
76:51 tail end of season three I told you guys
76:53 that I would you know sit in the cigar
76:56 lounge especially with my closest
76:58 friends and I used to just rattle off
77:00 any joke that would occur to my mind and
77:02 you know I have sort of a twisted
77:04 personality at one point because I've
77:07 heard so many of the normal jokes in the
77:08 world sometimes the more twisted crap
77:10 but we didn't go to a comedy club in Los
77:12 Angeles we're hours and hours of it some
77:14 that never gets the television because
77:17 it's too intense for television and it
77:19 grows on you're like oh my god that was
77:20 a genius that was so crazy and perverted
77:23 not perverted in a sexual way or and he
77:25 you know Ted Bundy way but just sort of
77:27 like it's a perversion of logic that
77:30 gets in there and it's just so hilarious
77:32 and I would try to like pop these jokes
77:34 on people and I'm cracking myself up
77:36 it'd have to half the people in my lab
77:38 maybe one person last maybe nobody
77:39 laughs and finally had a loved one very
77:43 close to me say you know you might want
77:45 to think about toning that back this was
77:47 several years ago and so I did I was it
77:50 was hard though what happened was I
77:53 would tourettes out these jokes and then
77:56 I'd be like Oh God there was and so I
77:59 make a mental note hold back on that
78:01 kind of stuff unless you're with your
78:02 friends who just loved it and I've got a
78:03 couple guys I smoked with and we'll be
78:06 watching some movie some YouTube video
78:08 and you just kind of whisper the joke
78:11 over to your buddy and he just starts
78:12 dying laughing cuz he's got the same
78:13 kind of mind you have he's been through
78:15 the same experiences you have he's tired
78:17 of the trite you know low lowbrow humor
78:20 that's out there all the time so if you
78:24 think you have a chronic situation that
78:26 you need to address again get out a pen
78:29 and paper and write it down you can curl
78:31 it up and burn it so no one ever finds
78:33 it but get it out and write it down
78:36 and I want to stress with you it just
78:40 hasn't known it's really sad I'm putting
78:41 it that the in this episode but here's
78:42 your little bonus thing I mentioned it
78:45 will only once before it is a scientific
78:48 fact that you don't remember [ __ ] when
78:53 you type it into a computer digitally
78:54 there's something about a monitor
78:57 whether it's a telephone or an iPad or
78:59 any type of digital display device if
79:02 you're typing it in there to remember it
79:04 you have to have a notification to
79:06 remember it most the time but if you
79:09 write it down with your hand into an
79:12 analog notebook it's almost as if you
79:16 never have to read it again because it
79:18 becomes a permanent archive and
79:19 instantly accessible piece of
79:21 information in your mind for the rest of
79:23 your life there's something about
79:25 tangibly stroking it out with a pen or
79:27 pencil that makes it embedded in your
79:31 mind in your soul on your system and
79:34 it's also a conduit to that entire
79:37 subject matter inside your mind so you
79:38 might write it down and then you can
79:43 extend the thoughts and the concepts
79:47 infinitely because you always have that
79:49 access point to the universe I made a
79:53 ton of episodes of season one and I
79:56 realized I was making two or three in
79:58 the same day and that's because I have I
80:02 don't know three dozen notebooks packed
80:07 with all kinds of scientific research
80:10 philosophical research and I don't need
80:13 to read them again I know exactly what
80:16 they say but if I write something into a
80:21 computer it takes me a lot of analog
80:24 regurgitation usually verbally before I
80:27 remember it I just finished a script and
80:31 I see the entire script in one image in
80:35 my brain from start to finish
80:37 I see act 1 2 3 & 4 just all in one
80:40 thing why because the initial notes were
80:44 taken in a notebook and then to
80:46 reinforce that I explained the script
80:49 to friends testing out scenes and making
80:51 sure things are funny with my mouth and
80:54 that seems to have another effect in
80:57 terms of painting this image in my mind
80:59 that's the way my mind works you might
81:01 want to try it if you're having issues
81:02 remembering things now there is a
81:06 difference in reading a book the amount
81:10 of people that I have talked to that
81:12 tell me they've read hundreds of books
81:14 and I say okay what's your favorite book
81:17 ah nothing zero I'll go okay why can't
81:24 you remember what you read I don't know
81:26 well they'll say they'll say a book I
81:28 say well what's that book what's it
81:30 about well it's kind of about this and
81:34 then so I drew a couple questions down
81:35 and they can't isolate any events in the
81:37 book when you're reading fictional books
81:41 you're in this kind of now moment it's
81:45 weird people watch movies they have a
81:48 little bit better recognition a really
81:51 good movie is one that you never forget
81:53 but it's also movie you can't watch
81:54 twice movies like Independence Day you'd
81:59 never need to see that movie again
82:00 there's no hidden layers to anything
82:02 it's just a straight-up action movie if
82:05 someone likes Blade Runner or 2001 a
82:08 Space Odyssey
82:10 you can talk forever about those films
82:13 about what each scene means because
82:15 Kubrick
82:18 Ridley Scott who worshiped Kubrick
82:21 operated in layers layers of all kinds
82:25 the image systems were so deep as
82:26 ridiculous back in 1995 the frequently
82:30 asked questions sheet on Blade Runner
82:32 was 22 pages now I think it's several
82:34 hundred pages now maybe some of that
82:37 stuff's wrong but it's so deep that it
82:40 exists people are still trying to
82:42 interpret things anyway I think you feel
82:47 me I feel passionate about making this
82:49 episode today so here it is if you
82:52 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
82:53 please go it's where all the feeds are
82:56 audio-video Locke's Facebook group a
82:58 Twitter page and a patreon page
83:01 take care of yourself and someone else
83:03 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
83:04 over now
83:13 you
