00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:33 deep thoughts today I'm gonna cover John
00:38 Carpenter's they live because I recently
00:42 mentioned it in my indoctrination
00:44 station episode stations episode and
00:49 when the listeners pointed out that I
00:51 completely inaccurately recapped the
00:53 movie the short bit that I did recap it
00:56 and I was like oh you know man it has
00:59 been years since I've seen this film so
01:02 let me go back and check it out I should
01:04 own it anyway and I don't own it I
01:06 didn't own it now I own it and so it's
01:09 important to me because that film is
01:11 very important to everybody and some
01:15 misquote it wasn't a big misquote it was
01:17 on a button wasn't a big once a misquote
01:19 it wasn't a huge faux pas but I don't
01:23 know what I'm seeing in my head there's
01:25 some other movie I'm seeing in my head
01:26 that I've mixed with that movie but
01:29 we're gonna cover that today and but
01:33 before we get into the film just very
01:37 quickly I think it's important to recap
01:39 for people who've never seen it it's
01:41 huge it's a huge film actually got the
01:43 year wrong - I thought it was released
01:45 in 1985 you know when someone quotes
01:49 something wrong to me and it sticks in
01:50 my brain and then I hang on to that and
01:52 then I say it a couple times and it's
01:54 stuck in there and I'm like son of a
01:55 [ __ ] it was released in November of
01:57 1988 which is actually kind of
02:01 interesting because I noticed in the
02:02 film there is a scene that is almost
02:08 identical to Total Recall which I
02:13 believe was released earlier that year
02:16 it's a big scene we'll probably not
02:21 cover that scene because it will ruin
02:23 something and it's not important to what
02:25 we're talking about here but why is they
02:27 live important it's based on a short
02:32 story that another guy wrote John
02:36 Carpenter directed it converted the
02:38 short story into a screenplay
02:40 and as always he wrote part of the
02:44 soundtrack when you listen to and you
02:48 have to understand that like John
02:49 Carpenter created Halloween the
02:52 franchise with Michael Myers you know he
02:54 directed and wrote the very first one he
02:56 wrote the iconic soundtrack and he's
02:59 been back several times to direct he did
03:01 not direct the third one which i think
03:04 is a great film but I don't think it
03:08 needs to be called Halloween as a part
03:10 of his franchise I think it should have
03:12 been spun off as its own film and it's a
03:14 brilliant thing all onto itself I'm sure
03:17 he was very frustrated by what they did
03:20 do was film franchise he's back and
03:23 control that thing now but John
03:25 Carpenter is like a very eccentric sort
03:28 of all-american guy supposedly I do for
03:31 my hometown rights for him from time to
03:33 time or did I don't think I've ever made
03:35 anything together but he's claimed of
03:38 being one of John's right-hand men got
03:44 at at least one point in his life but
03:48 John brought us the Halloween franchise
03:52 which is amazing it's just amazing first
03:55 story of that sort of type you know a
03:57 kid escapes from a sane asylum and comes
04:00 home to terrorize a neighborhood and
04:03 then you got Friday the 13th there's
04:05 another spin-off copy sort of you know
04:08 archetype but John also directed the the
04:14 thing which was another remake from the
04:17 past but I mean there's no comparison
04:19 between it and the remake and it's one
04:21 of these remakes where you're like oh my
04:23 god this is really now a contender for
04:27 great filmmaking and Kurt Russell was in
04:29 that too and he I believe he directed
04:31 the you know escape from New York's with
04:34 Kurt Russell who was also in the thing
04:36 and so this dude has just produced some
04:39 amazing films over the years and they
04:42 live is an interesting thing because now
04:46 30 years later 31 years later it is so
04:51 unbelievably
04:54 I guess you could say predictive
04:57 prophetic I mean the dude is like
05:00 unbelievably predicting the way that the
05:02 world ended up and of course there's
05:04 there's 1984 the book that's written
05:07 there's a brave new world there's
05:09 rollerball 1975 so there was a lot of
05:13 indicators that this was the case and of
05:15 course he didn't write the short story
05:17 but they the way that they did this was
05:21 amazing and I was told it was a remake
05:24 of an old movie from the 50s or
05:25 something but there's no such thing it's
05:27 as far as I know it's completely
05:28 original and even if it's like lightly
05:31 lifted from something else it doesn't
05:33 matter but the movie is set in Los
05:36 Angeles in the 80s so it's probably made
05:39 in 87-88 and then releases at the end of
05:42 88 and then most of Europe as I
05:44 understand it got in 1989 but it's just
05:46 been re-released in Europe as a fully
05:49 remastered movie which I would love to
05:51 see I've met John one time and he was
05:56 not happy to to meet me he didn't know
05:58 anything he was all by himself at e3 the
06:01 big video conference video game
06:02 conference we have in Los Angeles he was
06:04 just literally all by himself at the top
06:05 of a escalator no one around him no one
06:08 recognized the guy because he's he's
06:10 just not into that and I walked up to
06:14 him and I was like oh my god you know
06:15 I'm a huge fan that he was just like
06:17 okay again right see you later
06:19 he was that kind of guy so chucked him
06:22 up to being like a cowboy who doesn't
06:24 want to do the fandom thing I should
06:29 have mentioned that my buddy said work
06:31 with him on a Mars Mars movie but
06:34 whatever but John Carpenter also likes
06:36 bucket head so I think that's super cool
06:38 too as I understand it but they live is
06:43 about a guy whose name is nada in the
06:47 IMDB credits in a DA but I don't think
06:50 they ever say his name but the main
06:53 characters played by Roddy Piper it was
06:56 obviously a very famous wrestler at the
06:58 time and rod he's one of these guys it's
07:01 kind of a whole Cogan he's got his own
07:02 franchise very first-class individual
07:07 you know he's built like a brick
07:09 [ __ ] man he's sadly gone now
07:12 unfortunately left us early
07:15 he plays opposite a guy named Frank
07:17 who's played by Keith David you will see
07:21 in many many films excellent actors
07:23 still with us then God and it's about
07:29 nada
07:31 you know I'm just gonna call it Roddy's
07:32 character comes into town he's kind of a
07:34 drifter he's looking for work he gets
07:37 work on a construction site where he
07:39 meets Frank and then they he doesn't
07:44 have a place to stay and so Frank's like
07:46 you know come with me man I'll take you
07:48 back to my group and again like I said
07:52 before there's this sort of sanctuary
07:54 city it's down in LA and they've just
07:57 commandeered a field and turned it into
07:59 a little city and it's got everything
08:02 that's got showers little huts places to
08:04 live and you know every single thing a
08:06 homeless person would have they have but
08:09 they've kind of built it up a little bit
08:10 better and they're they have little
08:13 television and later that night after
08:18 they kind of eat and relax they're
08:21 watching television and some normal
08:23 thing and then all of a sudden someone
08:24 breaks into the television signal and a
08:27 dude is like an older guy with a beard
08:29 is kind of like you know you know you've
08:33 got to wake up and we're gonna stop them
08:34 and he's going through all these
08:35 different things about this warning and
08:38 it's kind of breaking in and out in and
08:40 out I'll let you watch it but people
08:42 start having like head pains like
08:44 headaches like man oh I'm getting kind
08:46 of a headache watching this like yeah
08:47 man I'm so sick and tired of this guy
08:48 interfering with our television and they
08:52 can't really understand what the hell
08:53 he's talking about and it kind of you
08:59 know
08:59 Roddy's character sees it Frank guy kind
09:02 of doesn't really pay attention to it as
09:03 I remember and then they just go to bed
09:06 you get up the next day and I guess it's
09:08 a weekend as I perceive it because I
09:12 don't believe they go to work the next
09:13 day but even if they did a big deal but
09:16 the thing happens again during the day
09:18 in this particular time
09:20 it's like a father-daughter is watching
09:23 this the daughters like a teenager and
09:24 she's like Oh daddy I got a headache and
09:26 he's like yeah me too well this dude's
09:28 breaking in and but he gets a longer
09:31 break this time this guy breaking and
09:33 gets a longer shot at what he's trying
09:34 to say and rowdy he's kind of looking
09:38 around and there's the church like a
09:40 Spanish kind of missionary church next
09:41 door but he finds this preacher guy who
09:46 seems to be blind but he seems to be
09:49 reciting he seems to be mouthing what
09:51 the guy is saying on the television as
09:53 if he knows the script and that kind of
09:56 peeks rotties interest preacher gets
10:00 grabbed by the guy who runs the homeless
10:05 shelter and they get him across the
10:07 street and they put him inside the
10:09 churches broad daylight and right he's
10:11 watching this thing and he's like man
10:13 this is weird and so he goes over and at
10:19 some point he goes over and they're
10:20 singing going on in the church a little
10:22 bit later on the singing going on the
10:23 church and so it sounds like there's a
10:25 congregation but it kind of goes in the
10:28 back door because he notices the guy
10:29 from the homeless place keep going in
10:31 there and he's like what's this guy
10:32 doing going into that church over there
10:34 and how does this preacher guy know what
10:37 this dude was saying on TV and he goes
10:40 in his back side door and he kind of
10:43 goes into this like little laboratories
10:45 got a little you know beakers and stuff
10:46 not not too intense I'm proud of John
10:49 not overdoing it but he notices there's
10:52 a stereo and a speaker wire that's going
10:56 into the room next door
10:57 and so rightie gets in there and he
10:59 looks around the corner he notices that
11:01 the homeless shelter guy who runs the
11:04 place is talking to the preacher guy and
11:06 there's other people in there and you're
11:08 going on about how they have to do
11:09 better and I think that old guy who's in
11:12 the transmissions in there sanae's like
11:16 whoa this is really weird so kind of
11:17 hides and he leans against this wall and
11:20 this panel pushes in and he's like oh my
11:24 god you know and he just quickly puts
11:26 the panel back then he comes outside and
11:30 goes across they go through the ritual
11:34 and you know at the homeless shelter and
11:36 then he convinces a guy he who's got
11:38 binoculars he's like it can I see those
11:40 binoculars I'll bring it right back yes
11:42 Sherman using the binoculars and so then
11:45 it's a little darker now and he's
11:46 looking and Frank comes up to him mrs.
11:49 what are you doing man he says man
11:51 there's something weird going on over
11:52 there
11:52 and Frank's whole position is look I got
11:55 a wife and kids I don't need any trouble
11:58 I'm just working here in the city
12:00 staying in the shelter sending all the
12:03 cash back home don't screw up our lives
12:06 right don't get us into trouble and he
12:09 was like man I'm just trying to find out
12:10 what's going on here it was plus our guy
12:14 is in there do you mean doesn't that
12:15 kind of piqued your interest he's like
12:16 no doesn't piqued my interest at all
12:18 obviously it does he just doesn't want
12:20 any trouble so before you know it
12:24 there's a gigantic police raid the next
12:28 day yes the next evening because I guess
12:30 I started before the evening concludes
12:32 they're starting to take everything out
12:34 of the church they've realized they've
12:36 comp had been compromised or something
12:38 instead of trying to pull these boxes in
12:39 this station wagon they're trying to get
12:42 everybody out of there they're walking a
12:43 priest across the street there's no such
12:45 stuff and there's a huge police raid the
12:47 helicopters come around the ghetto birds
12:48 cops show up and tons of cars they got
12:52 them all lined up in riot gear they're
12:54 going into the church they're reading
12:56 that and then there's like a bulldozer
12:57 situation showing up or they're starting
12:59 to bulldoze the sanctuary city and of
13:02 course rotties now switched into like
13:04 try to save people figure out where the
13:07 hell to run himself and he ends up
13:08 running down an alleyway and finding a
13:10 little building where people are hiding
13:14 in so he kind of spends the night there
13:17 next day the whole place is trashed and
13:20 of course they're trying to rebuild and
13:23 he's you know he's make sure everyone's
13:25 okay and then he goes across the street
13:27 and he sneaks into the church again and
13:30 it's all been turned upside down and he
13:33 doesn't quite know what to do until he
13:35 remembers well there was that panel that
13:38 fell open in the wall and so he pops the
13:45 panel
13:46 and there's a little tiny box in there
13:48 about 10 inches by 10 inches maybe a
13:52 foot tops and he sneaks it out and he
13:56 goes down an alleyway and he's opening
13:59 it up and it's got a bunch of sunglasses
14:01 in it and I falsely claimed that they
14:03 were Ray Bans it seems like the poster
14:06 was made with three bands but I don't
14:08 think it is anyway people have copied it
14:09 with Ray Ban so that's right good they
14:11 have a little tick on the end I'm sort
14:14 of a sunglass fan aficionado up to a
14:16 certain point I was one of the first
14:20 human beings in the United States of
14:21 America to wear poor souls I'll have you
14:23 know that I was working with a
14:26 distributor was working out of his
14:27 apartment in Florida like Miami or
14:29 something like that before he sold the
14:31 whole isince off to his exotica so I was
14:33 living with these things for about five
14:35 years there's my little boast my little
14:37 brag but anyway it's only a sunglasses
14:40 in it so he's just he's lucky deeper and
14:42 deeper in the into the box like what the
14:44 hell it must be something other secret
14:45 inner like maybe cocaine or something
14:46 right he's kind of pissed that he risked
14:50 his life and he went throw his whole
14:51 [ __ ] and so he just goes like I was
14:53 gonna take a pair of these glasses with
14:54 me leave the rest back there in the
14:56 alleyway and he starts tooling down the
14:59 street and comes out of the alleyway
15:00 turns the corner and he just puts him on
15:04 and when I Sonny up immediately realizes
15:08 the world's black and white it takes him
15:11 off because he's only looking at the
15:13 ground at the time and he's like whoa
15:14 puts him back on and he looks at it
15:18 looks down the street and this is where
15:21 we have this overlap with mice my
15:25 episode indoctrination stations I'm
15:28 gonna go into that whole thing but we're
15:29 gonna go with what the movie actually
15:31 goes with which is with these sunglasses
15:35 on you can see that every single piece
15:37 of advertisement that's been put
15:39 anywhere including magazines and
15:43 newspapers and money it's all got
15:47 subliminal messages that you can't see
15:49 with the naked eye unless you got these
15:51 glasses on the filter the frequency and
15:56 eventually you find out and this won't
15:58 ruin anything for you at all in fact it
16:00 sets it up
16:00 better that the entire city is having a
16:04 broadcasted signal a signal broadcasted
16:07 anthem that gets their mind not to see
16:10 what they're supposed to see what they
16:12 would normally see and so that's why
16:15 everybody everyone can't see it but the
16:18 glass is cut the frequency out and see
16:19 eyeballs can see it and so the message
16:21 is all over the place or sort of some of
16:26 them would kind of dovetail perfectly
16:27 with what we have in the world today and
16:30 some of them are sort of
16:31 counterintuitive to what we have today
16:32 the ones that are I would say the only
16:36 one that is sort of out of line with
16:38 what we have today because they're
16:39 trying to depopulate the world would be
16:41 marry and procreate is one of the
16:44 messages but the big Shepard Fairey obey
16:47 campaign with Andre the Giant as the
16:49 main face of it
16:50 he picked Andre a giant which is
16:52 interesting because you have Ronnie
16:53 Piper and the Roddy Piper in the movie I
16:55 will accidentally say Ronnie Piper
16:58 because I wasn't a big wrestling fan but
17:01 it's ro ddy
17:03 anyway so he got that from they live and
17:06 now it's everywhere on people's clothing
17:07 right you know Bay would be the biggest
17:12 globalist message you could probably
17:14 come up with if you were deduce all
17:16 these things down in a movie down to one
17:18 thing
17:20 that's what it would be but it they say
17:22 the word submit consume stay asleep it's
17:29 funny because the very first shot we see
17:30 him staring down the street there's a
17:32 lot of messages that don't repeat in my
17:36 just watching the film one of them is
17:38 sleep eight hours a day work eight hours
17:40 a day play eight hours a day you don't
17:42 see that one again very often but you do
17:45 see he goes to a newsstand and he's
17:51 looking at magazines and it's got all
17:53 the messages throughout the pages submit
17:55 you know consume obey and as soon as a
18:02 guy walks up next to him to grab
18:04 something off the magazine stand he
18:06 looks at the guy and realizes he looks
18:08 like the zombie alien it's a brilliant
18:12 mix between zombification
18:14 look but also alien look so it's not
18:16 necessarily rotted it's just the way
18:19 that their skin works which is very
18:22 interesting the guy selling in magazines
18:25 is a normal human being but the dude
18:27 holding a magazine next to me guys what
18:29 are you looking at man and he's just
18:31 like rowdy does a perfect job of like
18:33 taking the glasses off putting him on
18:34 taking him off he's like holy [ __ ] he's
18:37 not saying anything but the the guy
18:41 eventually gets in a car and takes off
18:42 and then he's obviously kind of looking
18:45 like a loiter around this newsstand so
18:47 the guy who's just been paid for the
18:50 magazine that the dude or a newspaper
18:52 whatever it was the drove off on the car
18:54 he's got some money in his hand he comes
18:55 up to the guy you know comes with the
18:57 writing goes man you're gonna buy a
18:58 thing or two I got to ask you to leave
19:00 and he's like oh no man he puts the
19:02 magazine back his brain is totally on
19:04 fire he can't even believe what he's
19:06 seeing it looks down at the money and
19:08 this is something I completely forgot
19:10 about the money says this is your god on
19:14 it unbelievably brilliant subliminal
19:19 messages plastered all over this film so
19:24 rowdy being who he is you know he's sort
19:27 of a you know all-american guy and he's
19:29 obviously wanting to do something about
19:31 what's going on here but this is a big
19:33 deal so he keeps walking down the street
19:36 he kind of goes into this like Whole
19:37 Foods place looks like the old Whole
19:39 Foods places which are teeny tiny little
19:41 joints you know any woking around he's
19:44 still looking around you need to like oh
19:46 my god there's people over the place and
19:47 he's bumping into people and finally
19:49 this woman bumps into him and she
19:54 apologizes and he looks over at her and
19:56 she's just one of these things and he's
19:58 like I you know he kind of says
20:01 something like you're an ugly [ __ ]
20:02 aren't you you know and and she's like
20:05 what and she's like can he see me could
20:09 he see us you know and he keeps doing
20:11 this boom boom boom and finally she
20:13 starts talking into her Rolex watch
20:15 starts reporting that they got one that
20:19 can see because they know they have a
20:21 resistance they're aware this guy's been
20:23 breaking in on television but I don't
20:25 think that they were aware necessarily
20:26 that there were sunglass
20:27 that were allowing people to see and so
20:31 what ends up in suing and this is where
20:33 I'm gonna start letting go of the actual
20:35 specifics of the film so you can watch
20:36 it and enjoy if they were just to
20:39 release that much of the film for free
20:41 everyone would want to see this foam I
20:43 tell you because it's how does it
20:46 resolve how does this work he has and I
20:50 forgot just how long this one fight
20:52 scene is between them but when he one of
20:55 the things that you'll notice about
20:58 carpenters films he really likes to have
21:00 fun with his films the soundtrack that
21:03 he wrote is very obvious in the film
21:05 because it's very kind of campy and
21:07 appropriate it really sets some bluesy
21:11 kind of cynthy thing that he's put
21:14 together and it's um it really works
21:17 with the film it's really cool this guy
21:19 knows the texture of his emotions
21:21 perfectly which is why he's famous at
21:23 what he does right love the thing I love
21:26 to hang with that guy for a day I should
21:30 say before I go too much further
21:31 definitely get this film it is awesome
21:33 and rinse for 4 bucks you can buy for 15
21:36 and it's worth it's just a great
21:38 heirloom to your collection of anything
21:40 you might have even downloadable and
21:42 it's not on Netflix so you can't get it
21:43 for free because it's still good why
21:46 give it away for free baby you know but
21:50 there's a point when he goes back to his
21:51 friend Frank and he's like you got to
21:54 come with me and you got to put these
21:56 glasses on and you got to see what the
21:59 hell I'm seeing and Frank is so
22:00 dedicated not to screwing up his life
22:02 because he knows how it goes once you
22:04 get involved you can't say no Frank
22:06 Frank's character his buddy is so
22:09 beautifully built up because Roddy's
22:12 like any one of us let's go let's get
22:14 the guns let's blow these [ __ ] away
22:16 let's get rid of the signal whatever you
22:17 got to do to stop this thing they don't
22:19 really have a plan but the Frank guys
22:21 like I know I'm like you deep down
22:23 inside but I know that this is dangerous
22:27 and I don't need danger in my life I
22:29 need a construction job I don't need the
22:31 world to unravel in front of me you know
22:33 I just need reliability because he's
22:35 probably like in his early 40s or
22:38 something like that the actor I would
22:40 imagine
22:41 can't quite tell his wisdom throws you
22:44 off for his age so you just don't quite
22:46 know you don't know how old Keith David
22:49 is but he they trying to convince his
22:56 buddy to help out and I've skipped some
22:59 pretty big scenes here so believe me I
23:01 understand I'm skipping some pretty
23:02 significant things meg Foster's in this
23:04 movie and if there's any woman that
23:05 looks like a freaking alien goddess its
23:08 meg Foster back in the 80s she has the
23:10 bluest eyes like the lightest bluest
23:13 eyes you've ever seen in your life and
23:15 she by all stretch also I should say all
23:21 measurements she is a beauty she's in
23:24 her peak at this point but she's she
23:26 plays a character in the film - I'll
23:28 just let you figure out that character
23:30 the Frank doesn't want to put these
23:32 glasses on he doesn't want that change
23:35 and so they had this brawl in an
23:37 alleyway and I thought I knew how long
23:40 this fight was and so I was trying to
23:43 get to the film quicker so I could kind
23:45 of get to this point where I could take
23:47 some notes in my brain about how to kind
23:49 of describe this film so I was sort of
23:50 fast forward into the fight scene oh my
23:53 god I must have slid the playhead on a
23:54 27-inch monitor I must have slid the
23:57 playhead like an inch and they're still
23:59 fighting and fighting and fighting it's
24:00 and it's kind of hysterical at the same
24:02 time and I think that I don't know why
24:05 carpenter made this fight scene so long
24:08 but the only thing I would say is that
24:10 it's probably an utter stroke of genius
24:13 that he made this fight scene like I
24:15 don't know 10 minutes long or something
24:16 because rowdy Ron hyper roddy piper
24:20 whatever he's a wrestling guy and so all
24:24 his wrestling fans are gonna watch this
24:26 and so you have a 10-minute fight of
24:28 course and it's Hollywood which is what
24:31 wrestling is up to a point you know and
24:34 so there's no like cushy surface to be
24:36 thrown down on but you know they're
24:38 beating the living crap out of each
24:39 other
24:40 and finally he wins like rowdy wins and
24:43 he's like just stuffing these glasses on
24:45 it on Frank's face and he's like just
24:47 holding the monitors face he's lifting
24:49 him up off the ground he's like you're
24:50 gonna come with me we're gonna walk down
24:52 the street and you're gonna look at the
24:53 goddamn world and he's
24:54 Isis man you're not gonna run away from
24:57 this I need your help
24:59 you know I don't even know what to do
25:00 and I have no plan let's do this right
25:02 and it's funny because the character
25:05 Frankie as he's being lifted up if you
25:08 watch it carefully you can see he's
25:10 being lifted up as an actor this Keith
25:12 guy he's David guy so he's trying to
25:15 keep the glasses on his face but like
25:16 Roddy's arms are all around his head so
25:18 he's kind of like reaching up and trying
25:19 to keep the glasses on his head going
25:21 for the complete opposite of what he was
25:22 trying to do and never to wear these
25:24 things
25:24 and of course he sees the world and he
25:27 sees it all screwed up and get a bunch
25:28 of new messages and as he looks around
25:31 and then the game is on then these guys
25:35 are gonna get involved and try to solve
25:39 this issue and that's sort of where I
25:42 want to leave it you know I I would say
25:45 that and we're gonna continue
25:46 elaborating on the meaning of this whole
25:48 thing you know the the ending is I would
25:54 say victorious up to a point and the
25:57 ending there there could have been more
25:59 there could have been a sequel that's
26:01 what I think is very interesting I
26:04 almost feel like and this has never been
26:06 done in history that I know of but I
26:09 think that John Carpenter could redo
26:11 this film you know it doesn't really
26:14 need to be redone necessarily the only
26:16 reason why you would do it on a deal
26:23 like why here's the thing if John did it
26:27 if John did a remake of his own movie
26:29 then he would hold up the standard that
26:31 needs to be held up it would be a shame
26:33 to lose the original film in any way
26:35 shape or form because it's a masterpiece
26:36 of course and I don't say you have to
26:38 make it because there's thing wrong with
26:39 the original film I just think that
26:43 maybe releasing here in the United
26:45 States would be the trick because I
26:47 think kids need to see this I think
26:48 adults need to see this because it's an
26:50 interesting metaphorical fun way you can
26:53 call it fun to wake up to go OK as the
27:00 film
27:00 progresses there's a lot of dialogue
27:03 about how these aliens are well I should
27:08 say what their objectives are what
27:10 they're doing and you know I guess I can
27:15 mention a few things just don't think
27:17 these will be spoilers whatsoever here
27:20 in terms of sort of what happens here
27:26 you have you basically find out that
27:30 these aliens and this is not a big
27:32 spoiler whatsoever they're just buying
27:35 humans off like there are human beings
27:37 that are willing to go with them on this
27:39 thing and of course that's what can be
27:45 done because that's what it's what
27:47 humans do they sell out right and so
27:51 what's interesting about it is that part
27:54 of the whole metaphor of this entire
27:57 thing is that the aliens are obviously
28:00 the ruling class of this world and all
28:03 of these subliminal messages which are
28:06 with science fiction technology of you
28:08 know beaming something so you can't see
28:11 what you're really seeing and that
28:12 there's these aliens walking around you
28:13 can't see him unless you have these
28:14 glasses on super cool by the way I mean
28:17 and what's cool about it is is that John
28:20 didn't take this so seriously that he
28:23 really tried to make super detailed
28:25 looking aliens but I'll tell you what
28:27 whoever came up with the makeup for
28:29 these things and John obviously is
28:31 they're saying yes no I think the makeup
28:34 other than at times you can see that
28:37 it's a mask that someone is wearing
28:39 though you know the way that it moves
28:40 because he doesn't have a billion
28:41 dollars to make a film today he would
28:43 which would be interesting to see what
28:45 he would do with the modern budget on
28:46 this thing because I think the thing
28:48 would make a ton of cash I just don't
28:50 think anyone would allow him to make the
28:51 film again because it's to a wakey-wakey
28:54 you know but I think they did a
28:57 brilliant job with the makeup and then
28:59 it's sort of timeless and it's sort of
29:02 funny and fun which is like carpenter if
29:05 you ever see all of the escape from New
29:07 York series and escape from LA you will
29:10 see that he likes to have a lot of fun
29:13 and he
29:13 Diggs I think comic books and making
29:17 them come real like escape from LA is a
29:20 comic book movie and it's brilliantly
29:23 done and it's like Kurt Russell doesn't
29:26 have to do anything in his life he
29:27 doesn't have to act in any rule but for
29:30 whatever reason he you know he gets
29:33 John's work and he's greased to it and
29:35 he makes these films and even though you
29:38 might be going if you set your
29:39 expectations wrong with escape from LA
29:41 you might be a little bit it's got Steve
29:43 Buscemi in it and he's some really cool
29:45 film but it's comic book II there's some
29:47 scenes in there that would never be
29:49 possible in real life in the slightest
29:51 way but it's so much fun the way that
29:54 John directs things so he has this magic
29:56 that he does you know with the thing if
30:00 any of you haven't seen the thing from
30:02 1981 somewhere in there it is a
30:06 masterpiece it is a masterpiece of
30:09 masterpiece super serious super gruesome
30:15 even to today's standards you know
30:21 you're gonna see some visual effects
30:22 that have dated just a little bit in the
30:25 thing but man most of it is still to
30:29 this day terrifying and amazing
30:31 so again John has really been blessed at
30:34 times to hit it out of the park and they
30:37 live as no exception but the the
30:42 methodology that you see with humans
30:45 selling out to these aliens is that
30:48 because there's a scene that illustrates
30:49 that for us is that that's what's going
30:53 on your your super PAC your Pelosi's
30:55 your Schumer's your shifts your Nathan
30:57 Adler's your comas your Mueller's your
31:00 wrote rot Rosenstein zall these guys
31:02 they just need a check with enough zeros
31:05 on it and they don't care about you
31:08 anymore it's all about get your own get
31:10 out you know it's you can't beat them
31:12 you join them and it's that's why they
31:13 only allow people that are easy to break
31:16 into those jobs you're already broken
31:18 before you even get to that job now
31:21 what's interesting is you know the film
31:23 is is marching along it marches along at
31:26 a really good pace too so the
31:27 the 10-minute fight scene which against
31:29 you know I interpret that as a
31:32 brilliantly executed exhibition piece
31:34 because you have one of the world's most
31:36 or one of them United States most
31:39 popular wrestlers is one of the main
31:42 characters it's a stroke of genius
31:44 in my opinion so other than that the
31:49 thing moves quick John really likes at
31:53 least liked this is thirty years ago so
31:54 I can't accuse him of anything today but
31:56 he likes guns he likes action scenes you
32:03 know if you ever have had if you've ever
32:05 built up any pent-up aggression that you
32:08 don't have any you know logical means of
32:13 exerting when it comes to waking up and
32:15 finding out that these folks are on top
32:17 of us and they've done silly things like
32:20 you know convince everyone else that we
32:24 don't own things we don't own our land I
32:26 think that's the thing that just got to
32:28 me today watch one of my old episodes
32:30 from Season one I was mentioning this
32:32 fact I forgot to put like a really
32:33 awesome point on it you know someone
32:35 convinces you that you don't own what
32:39 you own you pay for but you don't ever
32:41 own it royal estate real estate that
32:44 kind of thing you can never own the land
32:45 you live on
32:46 you know it's absurd it to pay property
32:48 tax on your stuff like you never own it
32:50 the Queen owns it and then they convince
32:53 about a bunch of other people that you
32:55 don't know what you own and so you can't
32:56 keep it because a bunch of morons are
32:58 sitting there turn it away from your
33:00 hands and so in this world there's a bit
33:04 of that Illustrated and there's some
33:05 beautiful moments of dialogue which I
33:07 absolutely cannot ruin for you that go
33:11 down the line of how man behaves and how
33:14 you know there was there's a point there
33:18 where one of the humans believes that
33:20 this is sort of the Robin Hood algorithm
33:22 and saying well you know they're gonna
33:25 they're helping us they're helping us
33:27 you know why'd you just go with it why
33:29 don't you just get yours and you know
33:30 and of course our heroes aren't shallow
33:34 and they're realizing you know what are
33:36 you an idiot
33:37 this is not humanity and this is not
33:40 and the the one thing I will reveal
33:44 because you may miss it if you watch it
33:46 is that if you listen to every word
33:47 spoken
33:49 remember this is 1988 and they had no
33:53 exact idea you know I mean they did at
33:54 some point but they didn't know when
33:56 they're making it exactly what year was
33:57 gonna come out or what month it was
33:58 gonna come out but generally they knew
34:00 it was gonna come in 88 but one of the
34:02 lines in the script is by 2025 these
34:08 aliens said that they're gonna totally
34:10 control the world if you pay attention
34:12 that's in the dialogue it's not one of
34:14 the main characters that says it I would
34:17 encourage you to get the film however
34:20 you gonna get it and you know get
34:24 distractions down all right don't let
34:26 anyone bother you while you're watching
34:27 this film with someone's pissin and
34:29 moanin tell them to go [ __ ] off and go
34:30 watch the film by yourself or whatever
34:32 you got to do because you want to sit
34:35 and concentrate on what's being said
34:36 because again it's some of the dialogue
34:40 is like a prophet speaking and what I
34:45 said when I originally talked about this
34:47 in my other episode was that it has
34:50 always baffled me that both the writer
34:53 of the short story which is like
34:55 something like 8 o'clock in the morning
34:57 or something like that or actually we
35:00 find out what the name of it is sort of
35:02 butchering it
35:03 yeah it's called 8 o'clock in the
35:05 morning I gotta go read that short story
35:08 but it just seemed like John was so
35:11 completely awake and of course I don't
35:14 know what it's like to be however old he
35:17 was in 88 I don't know
35:19 of course he incubate sit for a couple
35:20 years of course prior to actually being
35:22 able to make the film but the dude was
35:25 awake and I suppose this other guy was
35:26 awake too ray Nelson is the guy that
35:32 wrote the short story I want to give out
35:33 some credit there but this is the world
35:36 we live in I mean is these are the
35:38 messages that were given were but we're
35:40 also given in 2019 and obviously since
35:45 2016 presidential election we went from
35:49 you know everything and I'm just talking
35:51 from America I apologize and again
35:53 a bunch of you guys have been commenting
35:55 from Europe and around the world and let
35:59 me tell you I'll strata too we got good
36:01 following from Australia and thank you
36:03 folks from around the world I just can't
36:05 thank you enough for continuing to watch
36:07 the show but your comments you have to
36:10 understand when you comment about your
36:12 world from outside the United States I
36:14 start salivating the second that I see
36:16 over here in Australia over here in the
36:19 Netherlands or Norway or whatever I'm
36:22 just like oh you know just trying to
36:24 find as much information as possible you
36:26 guys could write three-page comments and
36:28 I'd just be reading every line of it you
36:31 have to be careful you could probably
36:32 fill me full of a bunch of crap - and
36:33 I'd believe it but that's what's
36:36 beautiful about comments cuz people come
36:37 in and go no it's not but anyway you
36:41 know we had a we had an economy that
36:43 sucked we had 40 percent of this country
36:47 on welfare we had this draconian
36:49 existence tax called the Obamacare
36:52 situation immigration completely [ __ ]
36:54 out of control our you know trade was
36:57 out of control stock markets still
36:58 really super wonky eight years after
37:01 Obama gets elected I mean this country
37:04 was really upside down and no one was
37:06 fixing [ __ ] right and so here comes a
37:09 guy that's gonna change things for
37:11 better for worse he's gonna change
37:12 things and not gonna follow their
37:15 diatribes gonna actually do something
37:17 for the American people which I think
37:18 he's done and yeah he's gotta do deals
37:21 he's gotta like you know he's got a
37:22 greased both palms every once in a while
37:24 but it ain't over yet either so you know
37:29 you greased for the first four years and
37:30 then you do what you want for the next
37:31 four years so let's just see what
37:33 happens here but anyway there just
37:35 becomes a breaking point and I think
37:36 this movie to finish my point I was
37:38 making earlier if you watch this film
37:40 and you see the the Frank and the nada
37:45 slash rowdy character kicks some ass
37:48 it's sort of therapeutic to watch
37:52 because you like yeah go get him and go
37:54 get him and then literally at one point
37:56 you know go into a room and there's like
38:01 you know maybe ten percent twenty
38:03 percent of these weirdos and there and
38:06 they're just [ __ ] smoking these guys
38:08 and of course no one else can see that
38:11 they're just kneeling just the aliens so
38:13 for them they're they think they're just
38:15 indiscriminately murdering human beings
38:17 and there's a when rowdy first takes
38:21 matters into his own hands he he does a
38:24 big wave of that and ends up sort of
38:28 becoming a wanted man but it doesn't
38:30 really ever materialize like a normal
38:31 movie like carpenter beautifully didn't
38:34 waste our time with this you know like
38:37 if you did it today and you have like a
38:39 cliche writer you would have like
38:43 Roddy's face to be all over every
38:44 television and this is the most wanted
38:46 man if you see this man do this he
38:47 didn't waste your time with that crap
38:49 right he does what he does he's gotta
38:52 lay low but they don't waste the whole
38:53 script on that so you see this you don't
38:55 lose the script and it's brilliant so
38:57 that's another just genius part of the
39:00 writing in my opinion there's just
39:02 sometimes when directors hit a diamond
39:05 they hit it just right and all like you
39:08 just you know you create one of the best
39:11 films that you're ever gonna create you
39:13 know and I think that they live has just
39:15 this unique flavor to it I would have
39:19 liked to have seen this story and I'm
39:20 sure he would have liked to as well but
39:22 again he ended it at a perfect point in
39:24 the script and I'm gonna I'm gonna let
39:26 you watch that and figure that out
39:28 obviously there's a limit to how much
39:33 they could correct things in Los Angeles
39:35 for the rest of the world and you have
39:37 no real idea about how much they
39:40 proliferated the rest of the world
39:41 there's a few comments made that they're
39:43 all around the world but there's no
39:45 proof that that's the case
39:47 might have been interesting to see some
39:49 kind of international television and
39:51 then you could look on the TV and you
39:53 would see the other weirdos do that's
39:57 never revealed but here we are in a
40:01 world where virtually everything that's
40:03 being said in this movie is now the
40:07 messages that we get through subliminal
40:09 social justice warriors star trek
40:11 discovery episodes the new Twilight
40:14 zones which I haven't seen are starting
40:16 to get panned because they have too much
40:18 sjw juice in them
40:20 you can watch Game of Thrones and see
40:22 this kind of stuff in there mean anytime
40:23 there's a mass audience audience these
40:26 controllers move in to control the
40:28 scripts to move out writers that aren't
40:30 performing to the mockingbirds standards
40:33 and then all of a sudden you start
40:34 getting all these kind of weird agendas
40:36 luckily for them there's a ton of them
40:39 already embedded right what I think is
40:41 interesting is that we're obviously a
40:44 gigantic group of people are waking up
40:46 and they're waking up you know we're
40:49 waking up today with so many different
40:51 methods some people go on YouTube and
40:53 wake up some people go on Twitter and
40:54 wake up so people are just going into
40:56 public and talking to their family and
40:58 their friends and waking up some people
41:01 are just being so repressed that they
41:05 are starting to wake up and I forgot
41:08 what circumstance it was I don't know if
41:13 it was fictional or real I think I was
41:16 seeing something fictional but it was
41:19 very interesting I know I've heard it in
41:21 real life as well from someone but there
41:24 was a point where this seems like this
41:26 was a long time ago but this is an
41:28 interesting thing and I hope not to
41:30 offend anyone with telling this story
41:32 but I think it was a it was a black guy
41:35 that was saying something I saw his the
41:40 gist of what he was saying was this he
41:41 goes he says you white folks are so
41:45 easily duped into your lala land of how
41:48 the world works and he goes if you grew
41:51 up in mire and this guy would have been
41:53 probably born in like the 50s or
41:55 something but he goes if you grew up in
41:58 my world he goes you know the cups can
42:00 get really corrupt you know that though
42:02 there's no real justice for you but
42:06 justice system can get super corrupt the
42:08 world can get corrupt you apply for a
42:09 job you don't get it and you're totally
42:11 qualified to do it and because he was
42:13 experiencing racial you know injustice
42:17 in his life and it's not that every
42:20 single waking moment this guy was
42:21 claiming that he was being messed with
42:23 but he just goes you see it you see it
42:25 in your neighborhood you see it in your
42:27 own life and it just happens and so I
42:30 thought that was interesting that
42:32 I think the guy's right under certain
42:34 circumstances certain groups of the
42:36 world have grown up with a tougher
42:38 existence and so when someone says hey
42:41 you know it's different than what you
42:43 think it ain't all bowl of flowers bowl
42:47 of cherries excuse me a bed of roses
42:49 bowl of cherries there you go it's
42:53 easier and I mentioned in an episode I
42:55 mentioned this several times different
42:56 episodes over the 400 shows I've done
42:58 but there's this thing where the mutts
43:03 of the world like I say you know I
43:05 consider myself to be sort of a quasi
43:07 mutt I didn't grow up in any ghetto or
43:10 anything
43:11 my family was definitely I could say at
43:16 times living with my old man we were
43:19 broke as a joke man like I said we had
43:21 like 50 bucks to last us two weeks to
43:23 guys now luckily we went to them the PX
43:27 and forgot to call the grocery store on
43:30 the base we'd buy all of our food on a
43:31 base and then take it home so he would
43:33 get what we needed for those two weeks
43:36 obviously more than two weeks worth of
43:37 food but then we come home and only have
43:39 50 bucks and then so you're like my
43:41 dad's got to buy gas to get to work so
43:44 you know I mean I was getting again I
43:46 was getting like I got jeans and
43:51 six-packs I'm not even joking man my dad
43:53 would buy these jeans all Wrangler jeans
43:55 and a big and it was just hard as rock
43:58 when you put him on you know it was like
43:59 I was living in Massachusetts wearing
44:01 sort of like jeans that you would wear
44:04 as a farm boy it was embarrassing
44:08 so again when I first tried making my
44:10 own money clothing it was the first
44:11 thing I bought was like man I'm not
44:13 dressing like a clown anymore I'm not
44:14 dressing like some hobo anymore but that
44:17 taught me a lot about how the world
44:19 worked and moving from different towns
44:22 and going to a bunch of different
44:23 schools but always being the new kid in
44:25 town even if I was going but coming back
44:26 to my hometown I I went there for a
44:28 little while
44:29 but I came in it I guess I came in and
44:31 started school there and then I left and
44:32 like it's a bunch of [ __ ] you guys don't
44:34 care about but I left in third grade and
44:39 then I came back in eighth grade
44:43 and so by time I finished high school I
44:45 was totally into the click of the town
44:47 and you know it was good but you just
44:49 end up becoming more enlightened because
44:51 you see more you see more of the of the
44:56 craziness of it all so some of the
45:00 messages I thought were brilliant and it
45:03 sort of perks me a little bit that this
45:05 Shepard Fairey obey brand is so huge
45:08 because kids are now wearing this I mean
45:11 I wear it as a joke with the zombie on
45:12 the front because I'm paying homage to
45:14 that they live the movie but this whole
45:16 Shepard Fairey thing with Andre the
45:18 Giant and you know I don't think Andre
45:21 ever his family or his daughter I don't
45:23 think she got any money from this brand
45:24 should have he did the whole poster
45:27 I mean how classic is that or he brought
45:30 us the the president that removed all
45:34 hope for his own party but you know you
45:39 think about some of the messages consume
45:41 consume I don't know about other
45:43 countries but America is all about
45:45 consume consume consume consume consume
45:48 food consume products you need new
45:52 things constantly otherwise Boyer not a
45:55 success it's like measuring yourself by
45:57 how much how many possessions you have
45:59 is just an IQ test you're failing if
46:03 you're falling for that you know and
46:04 I've I want to say I've got since I
46:07 mentioned something like that in an
46:08 episode I've had some great comments
46:11 where people said you know what I live
46:13 because I did too I mean you have to
46:15 understand I'm not standing on a soapbox
46:17 pointing fingers at anybody I did it and
46:20 I got out of it you know sometimes I got
46:23 out by force by not having a ton of
46:25 money but he want to meet a ton of money
46:26 last time I kept it to myself
46:29 pretty much but guys were like hey man I
46:32 lived the same kind of life and then I
46:34 said screw this I'm not doing this
46:35 anymore
46:36 but honestly you know go to the here's
46:40 what's kind of funny if you go to your
46:42 local electronics store and you price
46:44 out a big giant 4k or a ke television
46:47 what are you looking at you're looking
46:49 at from between 1500 bucks for a big-ass
46:51 4k I mean talking probably 70 to 80
46:54 inches up to
46:56 you know an $8,000 television and we
46:59 kind of look at that you know if you've
47:00 got that kind of cash and you feel like
47:02 that shit's important to you then do it
47:04 but think about what these little
47:06 cellphones cost these [ __ ] things are
47:09 like what eight hundred to two thousand
47:12 dollars now people like oh yeah no
47:14 problem you pay for it over two or three
47:15 years of your contract insight folks let
47:18 me tell you the amount of crap in this
47:20 phone I don't know maybe cost 100 bucks
47:24 you know spare me all this R&D [ __ ]
47:27 we're way past any Rd on a phone and
47:30 they're still charging more because
47:32 everybody's so damn stupid about what
47:33 the materials cost inside it does not
47:36 cost that much even you know I mean ARM
47:39 chips and all this other stuff that goes
47:41 in there all they do is they add a bed
47:43 of resistors or transient transistors
47:46 they put a bed of you know memory on you
47:48 know level one level two cache and it's
47:50 just all replication of the same thing
47:53 there's nothing innovative going on when
47:55 you get a quantum computing telephone
47:57 call me and we'll talk about why it cost
47:59 a lot of money because that'll make
48:00 sense the other big message that's in
48:03 there is submit and what is the name of
48:07 the game for folks that have had a great
48:08 life they're not the mutts they lived in
48:10 the same neighborhood their whole life
48:12 their parents provided for them they got
48:15 the job they they network because they
48:17 live in that and this is a good thing
48:18 it's not a bad thing but unfortunately
48:21 those are the folks that have the
48:23 hardest time breaking out of the cycle
48:25 and there's a ton of them in my family
48:27 that will die completely asleep and just
48:31 imagine you know I don't know what
48:32 happens here but you had some commenter
48:37 and my group that said oh sorry I'm like
48:39 one of the night group in one of the
48:40 videos it was like you need to see a
48:42 psychiatrist 9/11 was not an inside job
48:45 bla bla bla it's like as soon as you say
48:47 9/11 Sun in cha job you're like oh
48:49 really
48:50 yeah you're a genius unbelievable so
48:55 that is obviously what's going on
48:58 you know submit to your party you say
49:01 what your political party says for you
49:03 to say it doesn't matter if you're
49:05 stepping on someone else's head doesn't
49:06 matter if you're lying you just do
49:09 whatever you can to get yours
49:10 which is a big theme in this film
49:13 towards the second half I don't know if
49:16 my friend still believes this to this
49:18 day but one of my friends I love dearly
49:21 and respect dearly I would do anything
49:23 for the person said to me you know well
49:27 as long as you get yours you know [ __ ]
49:28 everybody else I'm look at the guy going
49:31 I wouldn't be your friend if I really
49:33 thought you live like that because
49:34 here's the thing this person's never
49:37 behaved like that around me ever and
49:40 we've spent a lot of time together and
49:41 we share a life together so if we miss
49:43 each other for six months we recap
49:45 everything and at no point in is this
49:47 person stepping on anyone's head to get
49:49 ahead but he said that maybe it's like
49:52 some pavlo nyan thing that someone told
49:54 him when he was young and so he just
49:55 blurts it out now he hears it from
49:57 somewhere you can't afford to go down
50:00 those roads but the other one but I kind
50:04 of just mentioned and miss my cue is
50:07 that the money had this is your god on
50:09 it I mean if you were I mean just think
50:14 about it you're a writer of some sort
50:16 and you're tasked you're maybe just John
50:19 Carpenter's good friend and this may
50:22 have been in the short story I don't I
50:23 haven't read it so I don't know whoever
50:25 thought up okay we got to write
50:26 something on money that really sends the
50:29 message that is the problem with you
50:32 know humans perception of money today
50:36 this is your god is absolutely spot-on
50:40 perfect isn't it because that's the way
50:42 we perceive it like I said you know I've
50:45 got friends that are not from America
50:47 and the in the country that they are
50:48 from and they live in America now they
50:51 lived in America for over 35 years but
50:53 they're family because the parents are
50:55 from this country the kids can't escape
50:59 that the parents only judge them to be
51:03 good kids and and pretend like literally
51:05 they're not they're not proud of their
51:07 kids unless they have a monetary system
51:12 to prove their success show mommy and
51:16 daddy how much money you have show us
51:19 how big your house is I mean literally
51:21 how much square footage do you have
51:22 well your brothers got a little bit more
51:24 footage so he's he's better kid than you
51:26 he's our star kid you're not our star
51:29 kid you know I mean you know one of the
51:33 kids is taking care of the parents there
51:35 they're old and one of them does a
51:37 really bad shape I've only heard a
51:40 little like one thing that one of these
51:43 adults and their family said to the kids
51:46 sacrificing his life to take care of the
51:47 parents that seem to be remotely
51:50 appreciative of that sacrifice and the
51:53 other two guys are just living their
51:54 lives ballin you know I mean literally
51:57 fancy cars and nice houses and traveling
52:00 anywhere they want to go making $100,000
52:02 a year yeah we have all extremes of the
52:10 gradient of money being our God and
52:15 that's got to change was the Stevie
52:19 Wonder in the song I wish I've mentioned
52:21 this a couple times but I just loved it
52:23 yeah he says you know something like
52:26 back then we only worried about what we
52:28 would get for Christmas and but he says
52:34 sometimes he wouldn't get a thing but it
52:35 was the joy the day would bring that
52:38 they ended up set you know celebrating
52:39 you know if any of you read the Diary of
52:41 Anne Frank whether that's true or false
52:44 you got to see this this world where
52:47 they made good with what they have and
52:49 you know that's happened somewhere in
52:51 the world multiple times and it happens
52:53 all the time in these real repressed
52:55 I wouldn't say repressed I shouldn't use
52:57 that word but areas were poverty by any
53:00 first world standard is present and
53:02 these families live in these huts and
53:05 these bizarre you know buildings if you
53:08 watch some of the the documentaries of
53:10 these kids from first worlds going into
53:13 the the slums of India you know they've
53:16 managed to really enjoy life in having
53:19 less you know I watched one show that
53:23 was it was I can't remember where the
53:27 heck it was it was I think it was an
53:28 Asian community and it was sort of like
53:31 the slum Dogz of India situation and the
53:34 documentary filmmaker who was another
53:36 she was Chinese if I remember right or
53:39 maybe she was Korean I can't remember
53:41 but if something on YouTube just like
53:42 when he's a little documentary someone
53:43 made and they noticed this family was
53:47 really really struggling the father had
53:51 left and the mother was packing coal for
53:54 a living like breaking the coal up and
53:55 putting it in bags and she's covered
53:57 head to toe and coal which is obviously
53:59 not good for her health and she has tons
54:03 of kids not it not I mean she had
54:06 probably about five or six kids and of
54:08 course they want things that other kids
54:10 have and they're living in a kind of
54:12 repressed community so the big thing
54:13 that they wanted was a TV and so unlike
54:18 most documentaries that just film all
54:20 the suffering and say thanks a lot we're
54:21 gonna go make a bunch of money off of
54:23 you you don't have to even sign a
54:24 release form because there's no way
54:25 you're gonna know where this thing airs
54:26 you never even see it cuz you know of a
54:28 TV and we're gonna go make you know one
54:30 hundred five hundred thousand dollars
54:32 off this thing unlike that okay this
54:36 host this woman and her crew went down
54:40 to a local store in the more affluent
54:43 area and bottom one of everything but
54:46 I'm a nice little TV it was like some
54:48 twenty inch television and bought it I
54:50 think bottom my gaming console of some
54:52 sort I don't think it was any super
54:54 name-brand thing but a few games in it
54:56 and bought them tons of food tons of
54:58 like things they really needed but some
55:00 also some recreational things so the
55:02 kids didn't have to because the kids
55:04 weren't gonna be weren't coming home at
55:07 a decent time because they were just
55:09 down the street watching the TV over
55:11 this break in the wall that because
55:14 there was no there was no window they
55:16 just would look in at the neighbor's TV
55:18 and the fun thing was that in this
55:20 community of nothing the people with TVs
55:24 knew that they were blessed to have the
55:26 TV and so they were allowing people to
55:28 sit and dock through their window they
55:29 weren't complaining that their privacy
55:31 was being invaded and that sort of thing
55:33 you know you know one of the biggest
55:35 messages that I want to end on is the
55:40 message stay asleep that was everywhere
55:44 stay asleep
55:47 and what's interesting about that is if
55:49 you think about that you know you know
55:53 how do we we don't really have anyone on
55:55 point saying stay asleep we've got this
55:59 backhanded thing this says stay asleep
56:02 the backhanded methodology is to say
56:05 are you questioning what I'm telling you
56:09 do you want to get kicked out of the
56:11 tribe the dnc tribe if you want to get
56:14 kicked out of the unión tribe do you
56:17 want to get kicked out of america you
56:19 know what did Bush say you know it's the
56:22 old saying either you're with us or
56:24 you're against us
56:25 big passive-aggressive threat of sort of
56:29 the bad nationalism you know I did an
56:32 episode on nationalism and I broke it
56:33 all down to the point where it's like
56:34 look guys
56:35 nationalism when you have do no harm a
56:40 constitution or Magna Carta or some
56:42 derivative between those two where in
56:46 the common law do no harm thing is
56:49 you're you're sort of summation there's
56:54 some there's some tough areas in there
56:57 you know like to say do no harm but
56:59 you're gonna have a second amendment
57:00 well the second amendments because we're
57:02 not completely civilized and at least
57:05 two thirds of the world have second
57:07 amendments whether or not they have a
57:08 constitution says they can have them
57:10 they have no Constitution says they
57:11 can't have them and so you got to be
57:13 careful you have to defend your utopia
57:15 biggest problem with Egypt is they
57:18 didn't build a gigantic army so when it
57:19 came time to fight they just lost
57:21 because all the mots of the world who
57:23 were living in much tougher regions with
57:26 much they had you know they were
57:28 imbalanced with nature and so they had
57:30 to fight boars and crazy predators and
57:33 so they got tough and when they wanted
57:36 to take what he Japan they they got it
57:38 you know took several phases but they
57:41 just took whatever they wanted and so
57:43 that's kind of what we have to have it
57:44 but nationalism on a Hitler level let's
57:50 just take the history book version of
57:52 Hitler and then you see Bush jr. after
57:56 9/11 either whistles with us are you
57:59 against us of course we had this
58:00 traumatic
58:01 we envisioned that supposedly all these
58:03 outside forces were against us which was
58:06 it's not like it's entirely untrue it's
58:09 just that they didn't have anything to
58:11 do with that day sorry lady we're being
58:15 threatened constantly to stay asleep and
58:20 if we don't stay asleep they're gonna
58:22 kick you out of the club the club you
58:24 shouldn't want to be a part of no matter
58:25 what and you know isn't it interesting
58:29 that the party that is saying which is
58:31 sort of the 17 movement the party that
58:34 says wake up think for yourself wake up
58:39 think for yourself this is the party
58:43 that the official party's official
58:46 tribes of our world right all the hit
58:49 pieces about you know the whole thing
58:53 with the 17 movement which is
58:54 interesting is that you have a group
58:59 whether or not it's real or not I mean I
59:01 think today it's like so legit it's
59:03 crazy but a group that's telling you to
59:07 wake up and think for yourself is never
59:08 going to be your enemy I mean never is
59:12 that going to be your enemy because that
59:16 is the last thing they want you to do
59:17 they want you to nothing for yourself
59:19 get into doublespeak cognitive
59:22 dissidence sort of brand loyalty
59:24 political loyalty consumer loyalty right
59:28 which is brand loyalty in another way
59:31 you know waste all your money on this
59:33 crap that you don't need so you're
59:35 always broke you've got no retirement
59:37 and so you know here's the thing let's
59:40 let's review retirement for one second
59:42 as a sort of an extension of stay asleep
59:47 now there are baby boomers who got in
59:50 early they did their thirty years here
59:52 20 years there and they've got a nest
59:54 egg they never rocked the boat didn't
59:57 have to rock the boat and they have
59:59 retirement money okay good for them I
60:03 got some of those people my family I'm
60:04 very glad because I don't have to take
60:06 care of them because they got their [ __ ]
60:07 worked out but now our generation Gen X
60:10 and below there's a bit of a problem
60:12 there's a challenge here
60:15 if they can keep you strung out on stuff
60:17 to the point where you can never amass
60:20 retirement because one if we lose this
60:23 truth movement if we lose the awakening
60:26 meaning lose it as a global movement and
60:28 we go back into this macron you know
60:31 Trudeau Merkel may Pelosi shroom ur
60:37 world of they're the only rich people on
60:40 the planet they get all the best health
60:42 care all the best all their kids
60:43 colleges are paid for we're paying for
60:46 it with our [ __ ] tax dollars and they
60:48 get to live scot-free in every regard
60:50 they can commit crimes and never get
60:53 charged because other people in the
60:55 crowd will protect them call me
60:57 protected Hillary from ever seeing a
61:00 jail cell at least during his shift if
61:03 you are broke and you are 70 years old
61:06 now there's gonna be social security at
61:08 some point better be if you've been paid
61:12 paying into it your whole life you will
61:16 have to apply for aid to live and
61:19 depending on the state of your country
61:22 and the state of the world as soon as
61:25 you go into their control apparatus
61:26 which is what happens so you know you're
61:30 healthy when you're young and eventually
61:32 your body will give out at some point
61:34 now if you're lucky you'll love a nice
61:37 rich life you'll live into your 80s and
61:39 90s comfortably you won't have any major
61:42 major setbacks health-wise and then
61:45 eventually you'll go to bed one night
61:46 and you just don't wake up that's the
61:48 best way to go out right natural causes
61:50 happen to all the time in my hometown
61:51 when I was a kid never happens in my own
61:54 town today
61:54 I'm suffer people that are whatever
61:57 whatever was before the baby boomers
61:59 some of those people are still alive in
62:01 my hometown they're the only ones that
62:03 go out that way all the baby boomers are
62:05 dying some horrible always cancers heart
62:09 attacks money in the cancer of course
62:13 but they get to decide what you get they
62:17 can thin the herd simply by denying you
62:19 services are putting you in some jeguk
62:21 gigantic draconian line of national
62:23 healthcare again the guy from
62:28 I think it was is it Norway the one I
62:32 mentioned recently with you know Bernie
62:36 Sanders is such a dumb [ __ ] he's uh
62:38 keeps telling you the socialism has
62:40 worked in various places of the world
62:42 this anyway he was I think he was
62:43 bragging about Norway and this guy from
62:45 Norway says look we tried this and
62:48 doesn't work we're not really a
62:49 socialism socialistic country anyway and
62:51 by the way one of the biggest failures
62:53 of our country is national health care
62:56 England who's had national health care
62:59 since the late 40s is trying to pull out
63:01 of it because it's atrocious people sit
63:04 in lines forever and the thing is what's
63:07 interesting about that is that and I
63:09 hate to say this because it insults a
63:12 huge group of people around the world
63:14 but there is something [ __ ] wrong
63:18 with government in general and that they
63:22 never seem to hire people who are that
63:25 intelligent they don't hire people that
63:28 think for themselves because none of
63:29 this stuff would be horrific right when
63:33 I first got to California the DMV which
63:35 is the Department of Motor Vehicles in
63:36 the United States I don't know what you
63:37 call it around the world was run
63:41 horribly I mean you would go in there
63:42 for hours and hours and hours and hours
63:44 and and it was hard to get you know you
63:47 go in for something simple and you're
63:48 behind all these people that have major
63:50 issues and you just need to like get
63:52 your picture taken for your driver's
63:54 license right now that's a little bit
63:57 better in California we've got some DMVs
63:58 that run like Disneyland they run tight
64:01 it's great but most the time when
64:05 government gets on top of something it's
64:06 run horribly and that's super
64:10 frustrating is super scary I mean if we
64:12 could change the system and I don't know
64:13 how you change the system do you I
64:15 probably would have to triple the
64:16 payrolls to get these people to come out
64:19 of PhDs and master degrees and come and
64:21 work for places and when they see
64:23 bureaucracy that's in the way of people
64:26 living the people getting things process
64:28 permits for building your driver's
64:30 license your registration all that kind
64:32 of stuff and again there's a lot of
64:33 assistance in some of these areas now
64:35 but think about you know
64:38 the I think I just mentioned this
64:40 episode so I apologize repeating I've
64:42 had this conversation a lot recently but
64:44 the multi-billion dollar I think it was
64:46 like I didn't want to quote a number but
64:48 I think it was like seven billion dollar
64:50 website for the national healthcare
64:52 services it crashed on the first day it
64:55 launched I mean it's just absurd someone
64:58 someone palmed billions and built a
65:01 website that probably only cost a couple
65:03 tens of millions you know so they live
65:08 is a masterpiece of American cinema
65:12 again if you're coming in with a Michael
65:14 Bay brain you know you'll have issues
65:17 with you know the special effects or
65:20 whatever but I don't think anybody on
65:21 this channel is that shallow that would
65:23 never insult anybody like that but it is
65:27 a great film in that it sends a message
65:30 I think what was interesting about it
65:33 you know I can just tell you from being
65:36 if it came out in 88 November 88 I was
65:39 19 years old and so I'm watching this
65:44 film and I'm in fact I didn't see it in
65:46 the theaters I don't think I saw it in
65:48 the theaters I had to see it some other
65:49 place and I can't even remember where
65:50 the hell that was but I remember seeing
65:53 it and the world wasn't post 9/11 was
65:57 pre 9/11 and some watching this and you
66:00 know it's it's all kind of sci-fi and
66:02 not interesting but I'm sure beyond the
66:06 shadow of a doubt that when carpenters
66:07 making this and when adults saw it who
66:10 had been through the Machine a little
66:11 bit they should have seen it and went oh
66:14 my god that's the most profound easy
66:16 OnPoint metaphor I've ever seen in my
66:19 life for the way the world really works
66:21 and that's why I think you're gonna
66:23 really enjoy today and I think it's
66:27 fascinating I just was looking up on
66:30 Armed IMDB I didn't know our IMDB he had
66:32 release dates maybe it's a new feature
66:34 where they actually tell you the exact
66:36 region and year that this movie has
66:39 released and re-released on what kind of
66:41 things so I saw in here means only May
66:44 it's the end of May tonight today is May
66:47 29th just in case you guys want to know
66:49 when these things are recorded
66:50 I have an episode that's coming up
66:52 that's gonna be about having skin in the
66:53 game and so maybe I'll release that
66:56 first or release it right after this
66:57 episode so it's kind of you know Roddy
67:00 Piper and Frank got in got their skin in
67:02 the game and they sacrificed potentially
67:04 sacrificed their life to to defeat these
67:09 guys doesn't have a sad ending trust me
67:13 but it rereleased remastered I believe
67:16 in France let me just make sure here
67:20 yeah so right here says January 2nd 2019
67:26 this movie was restored and re-released
67:29 in France think about that if you're
67:33 awake you know what that means
67:36 they just had a huge election over there
67:38 and microns group lost power essentially
67:41 and I think the woman's name is lay pin
67:46 if I got that right the blond haired
67:48 woman blonde haired woman over there
67:50 that whose party just crushed the
67:53 election in France she was speaking the
67:56 truth to the EU and got arrested for
68:01 dare daring to mention how absolutely
68:05 screwed up the EU is and now her party
68:08 just won they've been riots now for six
68:11 months straight
68:12 those yellow vests over there and I
68:13 guess it's spreading in different parts
68:15 of the world but the yellow vests over
68:16 there just got their movie on January
68:19 2nd imagine a yellow vest protester with
68:23 all their seventeen stuff all over their
68:24 vests look up the letter seventeen if
68:28 you're confused about what I'm saying
68:30 but they just got the most profound
68:33 reinforcement of their entire movement
68:35 they can just point at the screening
68:37 going because French people love films a
68:39 man like they they consider themselves
68:41 to be the first true artistic filmmakers
68:43 whether that's true or nuns will let
68:45 them disguise figure it out right but to
68:48 have this rerelease over there I think
68:49 is so unbelievably poetic in terms of
68:54 timing so pretty glad very glad that
68:58 happened so I hope you guys take some
69:01 time out of your life if you haven't
69:03 seen it
69:04 long time like me I probably haven't
69:07 seen that movie in 20 years maybe even
69:10 more definitely go see it I found it to
69:12 be totally enriching I've got two or
69:16 three friends lined up to watch it again
69:17 with me so I'm gonna watch it two or
69:19 three more times in the next 30 days and
69:21 I can't wait I'm gonna probably watch it
69:24 again while I code over the next week
69:27 here but it's just worth your time it's
69:30 really brilliant and it sends a message
69:32 that's just powerful I would be
69:34 interested after you guys actually see
69:35 it if you can remember to come back to
69:37 this episodes comment section on YouTube
69:39 and post any epiphanies you had for the
69:44 listener that corrected me on it
69:45 now that we've opened up the can on this
69:48 movie
69:49 try not to post any spoilers or at least
69:52 put that in your comment if you read
69:53 this gonna be a spoiler alert or
69:55 whatever because we don't want to ruin
69:56 it for anybody but what I thought was
69:59 awesome and you know I thought it made
70:02 like a horrendous mistake it was a total
70:05 mistake about I thought that the
70:07 preacher gave Roddy Piper the box and
70:10 that was absolutely wrong but what I
70:13 find to be very I'll put this way but I
70:17 tremendously respected about the
70:18 person's anger towards my getting this
70:22 wrong was that that person valued this
70:24 film a lot and said look dude you
70:27 massacred this film take this down and
70:30 refit and fix it and I was gonna do it
70:32 but then I watched it it was only like a
70:34 couple minutes I got wrong and so it was
70:35 all wrong in those two minutes but I
70:37 thought well yeah I won't take it
70:38 completely down some of the listeners
70:40 like don't don't cave in to that so this
70:42 is sort of something that needed to
70:44 happen anyway I've actually had this in
70:46 the back of my mind as an episode and I
70:48 just constantly forgot about it
70:49 so this event catalyzed this episode so
70:52 I'm very happy that the circumstances
70:54 occurred just know that I'll be a little
70:58 more careful in the future if I go
71:00 mention films that I haven't seen in 20
71:01 years plus I'll go and watch it
71:03 or I'll be a lot more careful about it
71:05 you know how I quote something because
71:08 that you know I gotta be careful I don't
71:09 want to be a source of disinformation I
71:12 have posted the corrections in the
71:14 description of the indoctrination
71:16 stations
71:18 so anyway if you hadn't into deep
71:20 thoughts radio calm I made a few changes
71:22 so the navigation was starting to get a
71:24 little crazy start going way across I am
71:26 in the next two months going to swap out
71:29 that WordPress template I'm using
71:30 because it's just not conducive to what
71:32 we're trying to do here so there now is
71:37 a kind of a there's hierarchical menus
71:42 now for the videos the audio if there's
71:44 only one source for the video actually
71:45 something even true we got bit shoot and
71:47 bright T on finally got bright T on to
71:48 work what I figured out was a bright
71:50 team wants to be the reason why I wasn't
71:52 working as I was giving it the original
71:54 1080p 4k versions of the shows and it
71:58 doesn't want those files are too big and
71:59 so I started using the 720p versions on
72:02 both bit shoot in bright yon which is
72:05 really the size you viewed anyway it's
72:07 perfectly fine it's not really a
72:09 resolution it's the big deal I'll try to
72:12 get the 4k up when it comes to episode
72:14 300 so I've broken broke all those down
72:19 so there's the audio has three links in
72:21 it for the podcast the iTunes and the
72:23 Google play again under video it's
72:26 YouTube's bit shoot and bright tea on I
72:29 have the social media links now so
72:31 there's Facebook and Twitter and their
72:35 own little section I have the link to
72:37 season 1 and then I have a donate
72:41 section which has the patreon the PayPal
72:47 and I am supporting the the Bravo are
72:52 sorry the Bravo the brave browser I'm
72:55 gonna tell you this brave browser is
72:57 super duper cool I mean I watched it on
73:00 another dudes conspiracy thing and he
73:02 was I could tell it was a monetary thing
73:04 I don't know what you make for for doing
73:07 it but I put it on my phone put it on my
73:09 laptop put it on my desktop and I could
73:12 not be happier the coolest thing about
73:14 brave because again if you watch my
73:16 episode back in season one about how
73:17 they spy on you
73:18 you were not stopping the five eyes from
73:22 getting your information you're not but
73:24 what you are doing is you're breaking
73:25 down these corporations from being able
73:27 to cross stitch your information not
73:29 that they technically have access
73:31 to that stuff because they they
73:32 technically don't but if you hate the
73:34 fact that you go to Amazon search on
73:37 Black & Decker drill and then you come
73:40 back to Facebook and then all of a
73:41 sudden your Amazon cart is in your
73:45 Facebook ads if you hate that [ __ ] this
73:48 browser cuts it off it blocks all the
73:51 trackers which is awesome the other
73:54 thing that it does is it breaks down the
73:56 it stops ads from coming from ad servers
73:59 and the third thing it does which is
74:02 fantastic and B it could be slightly
74:04 annoying sometimes at least on the
74:06 desktop version but it's worth it is it
74:09 keeps all those pre run movies from
74:12 happening so when you go to Fox or some
74:14 other website that's gonna thrust these
74:16 videos at you and you don't want to see
74:18 any of that [ __ ] you just want to read
74:19 the article and air it is streaming in
74:21 if you scroll down it pops the video out
74:23 puts it on this little side thing and
74:25 plays it to you
74:26 it totally cuts that off and so then you
74:30 have to kind of pounce on the video a
74:31 little bit to get it to play the other
74:33 link that's up there that I keep pimping
74:35 out is the new season one I am
74:38 drastically improving the editing
74:41 process if I got a buck for every time I
74:43 got rid of an um which I've just said a
74:48 bunch of times in this video you know a
74:50 right Eickhoff a big pause I could buy a
74:55 new house let me tell you so I'm
74:57 stripping out all that crap and then I'm
74:59 editing it back down boosting all the
75:00 volumes that the volumes are wonky up
75:02 and down I'm using addition to
75:05 streamline all the audio to the same
75:06 volume increasing the volume of louder
75:08 than the music and so this new season
75:11 one is much more tolerable and I just
75:14 want to say I'm gonna repeat this
75:16 several times because people are coming
75:17 in brand new so I apologize to the
75:19 chronic listeners hopefully you just
75:21 like this out of my voice rambling on
75:23 the season one is really the advanced
75:27 course which is the basic course of this
75:30 entire show it goes at the jugular of
75:33 key issues that will help your life be
75:37 better I think at us all the videos it's
75:39 probably 60% self improvement or social
75:42 issues that
75:44 screw up our lives so if you want to
75:46 have a good kind of reminder course or
75:49 an expanding course which I would dare
75:52 say the word enlightening course of
75:54 episodes I do apologize for being on top
75:56 of the microphone I've tried to cut a
75:58 lot of the breathing but I'm still
76:00 messing up you know I'll watch a video
76:02 back and it's got throat clearing and
76:03 all that crap so I do apologize for that
76:05 quality but the content is pretty pretty
76:08 good so that link is up there as well
76:10 and so bid shoot and bright tea on are
76:15 coming up from the season one Brian's
76:17 got this word lemon I've talked to their
76:18 support staff and the Glenn guy I think
76:21 runs the place you know I've asked to
76:24 see if they could kind of lift my limit
76:27 but the way they work is that we have to
76:28 have our first nine videos you have to
76:30 get pounced on by viewers otherwise
76:34 they'll won't let us get any more videos
76:36 up there and what they're trying to say
76:37 is if your channels not popular we don't
76:40 want any more of your videos up there
76:41 which is sort of a shitty thing but what
76:44 the guy told me was he goes look this
76:45 new version is happening in June 2019 is
76:48 going to reduce our serving slash
76:50 hosting costs by 90% he goes if that is
76:53 successful then we're just gonna lift
76:55 the band altogether and you're going to
76:56 be ok so they're doing what they can to
76:58 the pull that off [ __ ] who doesn't have
77:00 any of that but [ __ ] shoot has a weird
77:02 bug that sometimes when I upload a video
77:04 and commit it to be published
77:06 it never encodes and I gotta kill it and
77:09 reupload it so sometimes the [ __ ] shoot
77:11 episodes are out of order
77:13 I don't think people if they're seeing
77:15 this they're just looking at the title
77:16 and seeing if it's anything interesting
77:18 to them so if you see that kind of walk
77:20 eNOS and the numbering system that's why
77:22 but there's a brand new channel on
77:23 YouTube that is dedicated to deep
77:25 thoughts season one again it will only
77:27 have season 1 in it
77:28 but that's because I don't want to muddy
77:30 up the other channel I'm not gonna be
77:32 able to monetize season 1 unless it
77:35 takes off and I get a you know a ton of
77:38 subscribers and which I probably will
77:41 never get so this party's gonna be out
77:42 there ad freeze so you guys can get
77:44 digested with any any interruptions I
77:47 think that's it go get I they live I
77:51 live go get they live by John Carpenter
77:53 1988 give it a look-see and tell me what
77:57 you think if you guys know the film and
77:58 just start writing comments because I
78:00 want to hear what you think anyway until
78:03 next time take care of yourself and
78:05 someone else and I'll see you in the
78:06 next deep thoughts over
78:08 [Music]
