00:14 so
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:37 we're gonna go for round two of these
00:41 these whiskey sticks from my father
00:44 sent me another one because i told him
00:46 the first one was so good
00:47 i swear this one was a little bit bigger
00:49 but i can't remember
00:51 the other size so the listener
00:55 that brought up in a comment on youtube
00:59 this amazing thing about
01:02 egypt that changes the entire game
01:07 it absolutely wipes out any doubt that
01:10 these individuals were
01:12 initially egyptian for sure in my
01:14 opinion
01:16 and that's not that's not important to
01:18 me that these people didn't build this
01:19 place it just happens to be the
01:21 unfortunate truth for their history now
01:23 i think that they did
01:24 eventually participate and build up some
01:28 of the last things that occurred there
01:29 but
01:30 in terms of most of the jaw-dropping
01:32 stuff
01:33 i'm not sure but i did instant earth
01:36 episode right
01:39 and i prefaced that episode
01:42 on the notion that incredible
01:45 pre-dynastic construction occurred
01:48 prior to any visible
01:53 writing which usually leads to someone
01:56 saying culture
01:58 now i'm sure whoever built this
02:00 pre-dynastic stuff had their own culture
02:04 but in terms of recording it in written
02:05 language
02:07 not the case
02:10 all the pre-dynastic stuff is without
02:12 writing
02:14 some of the facilities have had paint
02:16 put on the wall
02:17 and like it's like a it's like a stuccoe
02:20 kind of stuff on them well not really
02:21 stucco but like a plaster on the wall
02:23 and then they
02:24 they actually transcribed on the plaster
02:27 one because the mixture that they made
02:29 was very bright
02:30 thus giving a lot of contrast for
02:32 whatever they put on the wall it's
02:34 because you can't go to a
02:35 a stone wall and just start putting
02:37 black writing when you got 50
02:39 gray behind it you're not going to see
02:40 it that well so
02:42 just like we buy canvases that are white
02:44 and not canvases that are
02:45 gray that's why
02:50 this one little factoid
02:53 has utterly blown my mind and i've
02:55 brought it up to two or three people who
02:57 i know digest this kind of content
02:59 online
03:00 in my own private circle and man just
03:03 watching their eyes drift into nowhere
03:06 and you know in one case one person just
03:09 tries to change the subject in the
03:10 conversation not realizing
03:12 that that's what they're doing to deal
03:14 with it
03:15 it's so strange our cognitive dissonance
03:17 is such a
03:19 defense mechanism to deal with life
03:22 but here's the here's the mind blower
03:24 right
03:25 i will have said this in a previous
03:26 episode that probably will air before
03:28 this one
03:29 maybe i'll switch it up now in my home
03:33 as a result of being in egyptology
03:37 as a you know anyone of us searching on
03:40 things and buying things
03:43 i was living in the san francisco area
03:46 and i ended up
03:48 buying every single book i could find
03:51 on the subject and in my books
03:55 are hieroglyph after hieroglyph after
03:57 hieroglyph
03:58 that are translated into english
04:02 and you find all kinds of things in
04:04 those hieroglyphs that you didn't know
04:06 were written long enough ago
04:09 to be in a different part of the world
04:11 like the prodigal son story is
04:13 a hieroglyph not a lot of people know
04:16 that
04:17 i didn't know that but now
04:20 there is one thing that i have never
04:22 found
04:24 mentioned and you mean you may have
04:27 something i don't
04:29 i don't have any of it i studied
04:32 arabic so that i could attempt to
04:35 translate
04:35 hieroglyphs still i mean that's how many
04:38 hieroglyphs i've looked at to
04:41 to do this now i can't translate them
04:43 fluently or anything
04:46 but i get pretty good at you know
04:48 meticulously
04:49 translating the consonants and go
04:51 looking up things
04:53 but at no point in any of the
04:54 hieroglyphs is a mention
04:57 of a pyramid not its construction
05:01 not its existence there is
05:05 or are
05:08 these it's strange because people will
05:11 have documentaries and they will show
05:13 there's because there's only one image
05:14 that i know
05:17 that calls out to something like this
05:20 a pyramid is in this relief i'm not sure
05:25 if it's babylonian or egyptian a lot of
05:28 it has to do with anunnaki
05:30 stuff but there is
05:33 one hieroglyph that's actually pretty
05:35 hard to find
05:37 unless i guess you know its name but
05:39 there's a
05:40 seemingly a leader on a throne and they
05:43 are looking at the pyramid
05:46 a pyramid and there's a beam coming
05:48 through that cobra
05:49 the serpent into the third eye and
05:52 bouncing off the pyramid and going up
05:55 but i see this stuff in videos and then
05:57 go and look for it so i can put it in
06:00 videos for you guys and that is one
06:03 that has been extremely difficult to
06:04 find you can use
06:06 every word that you can think of to find
06:10 that hieroglyph
06:12 that's the one
06:15 what about all the other things all the
06:17 other writings
06:19 the amazing feat of creating this in the
06:21 first place
06:24 now even if we say okay like
06:27 instant earth this stuff is built by
06:31 a generation of humans
06:34 that perhaps have a different earth to
06:37 deal with
06:39 the interesting thing about earth and
06:41 expanding earth
06:43 although this is going to hurt your
06:44 brain because you've been told how old
06:46 man is on this planet
06:49 and you've been told how many billions
06:50 of years old the earth is
06:53 which seems to be getting older and
06:55 older and older because
06:56 one of my closest friends who's a
06:57 geologist
06:59 i have a book in my house that i think
07:01 is called 4 billion years and i think
07:03 now we're at 5.3 billion years and
07:06 just to keep making earth older and
07:08 older and older
07:10 you know why try to answer questions
07:12 that we have no hope of answering that's
07:14 my big
07:15 question back to them it would make
07:18 sense that the
07:20 basalt boxes those 110 boxes that i keep
07:24 mentioning to you guys in different
07:25 episodes
07:26 that you would know that those exist and
07:28 not necessarily embed them in any story
07:31 one they're hidden they're in tunnels
07:33 and what have you so maybe
07:35 they're secret in the first place and
07:36 you wouldn't want to call anything out
07:39 but a bunch of pyramids the other thing
07:42 that i
07:43 discovered was that in all of the
07:46 official
07:47 egyptology stuff i have and some of the
07:49 books i have are reprints from
07:51 the early 20th century in the late 19th
07:55 century so the 1800s and the 1990s or
07:57 1900s right
08:00 books from about 1920 going back to
08:02 about 1880
08:03 somewhere in there they're just reprints
08:05 you just look in the front of the book
08:06 and
08:07 they'll tell you exactly the first time
08:08 it's been printed
08:10 the the intro in some cases has been
08:13 inserted
08:14 a preface or i should say a forward
08:19 to explain where this book came from
08:21 that kind of thing
08:22 but the pyramids of giza is
08:27 your kind of grade school version of the
08:30 story that you learn about there's three
08:32 pyramids in egypt and that's it boys and
08:34 girls
08:36 it's like goldilocks man right there's
08:38 big daddy one and then the middle one
08:40 and then the little one
08:43 and then you get some books and you
08:44 realize that there are
08:47 bent pyramids and other gigantic
08:51 pseudo mountains that are actually
08:52 pyramids the individual rocks
08:55 and stones i should say that you can see
08:57 were were
08:59 quarried carved and put in place
09:02 you find out initially they tell you
09:05 that the bent pyramid
09:07 there's only a couple of them there are
09:08 mistakes before they figured out the
09:11 the true method of building the gray
09:12 pyramids
09:14 and then you find out there's about 125
09:17 bent pyramids
09:18 in various states of condition
09:22 pyramids that are so
09:26 eroded that we don't know what their
09:28 final form
09:29 actually was we can only assume there
09:33 are pyramids that appear to have
09:34 exploded
09:36 i just watched a documentary uh i
09:38 shouldn't say that
09:39 a video of a kid that went to the giza
09:43 plateau
09:43 and started filming the ground and
09:45 started noticing what he called
09:47 i'm not convinced just yet but he he
09:50 said molten
09:51 limestone and it was in the seams of the
09:54 limestone that ran away from the great
09:56 pyramids
09:57 it does look like the stone has been
09:59 liquefied
10:01 well the theory that i put forth
10:05 that brian forrester has a totally
10:07 different mechanism for making this
10:09 happen but we're actually speaking the
10:10 same language when it comes to the final
10:12 product of what happened
10:15 he read a book on a plasma charge that
10:17 comes from the center of the galaxy and
10:19 flies our direction and just hurts
10:20 statues in egypt right
10:23 that's a bunch of malarkey but the fact
10:26 that
10:26 if you study tesla and the warden cliff
10:28 tower and the siphoning of plasma energy
10:30 from the core of the earth out
10:32 you get if you build a thousand pyramids
10:36 all over africa
10:39 and you're siphoning this stuff out and
10:40 you put too many of them close together
10:43 or you just simply build too many of
10:44 them you could siphon out
10:47 a pretty bad light show
10:51 and you're going to have some pyramids
10:53 be the epicenter of the siphon
10:55 over charging it could be the method in
10:57 which the pyramid was built
11:00 and you're going to get a pyramid to
11:01 explode you're going to get
11:03 white plasma energy just
11:06 barfing out of the ground you're going
11:08 to have statues knocked over and fried
11:11 this could have also happened in south
11:13 america where they have a few
11:15 structures that are similar although i
11:18 i don't know about the uh the electrical
11:21 properties of the ones in south america
11:23 i just don't know
11:24 maybe they're exactly the same
11:27 but in one fell swoop these pyramids are
11:29 deemed
11:31 evil because they overbuilt them how do
11:34 you disable a pyramid
11:36 for being an electrical outlet to the
11:39 center of the earth
11:40 you take all the veneer stone off
11:43 until it's no longer non-conductive
11:46 protecting conductive right
11:49 non-conductive
11:50 outer limestone protecting conductive
11:52 internal limestone
11:53 which is also laced with red granite
11:56 which is a very
11:57 conductive what geologists apparently
11:59 call a liquid rock
12:02 the pyramids not being in ample supply
12:06 inside hiberglyphs
12:09 is a mind blower of
12:12 pretty much epic proportions men
12:16 it would almost suggest that the instant
12:18 earth theory
12:19 which to clarify for those of you who
12:21 haven't gone off and watched that show
12:24 that this is a container of some sort
12:26 that we are in
12:28 with the illusion of cosmology
12:31 and through different phases
12:34 societies are allowed to exist and then
12:37 they get wiped out
12:39 resetting it back to an instant earth
12:42 situation
12:44 it just dawned on me imagine you're the
12:46 president of the country a country any
12:48 country but a but a first world country
12:50 or a super overpopulated third world
12:52 country
12:54 and somehow you learn that this is about
12:56 to occur on your watch that they're
12:58 about to reset the world
13:01 and therefore all of the things that you
13:04 were refusing to do with your life
13:06 for all kinds of reasons
13:10 money reasons and moral reasons or
13:11 whatever you just throw the cuffs off
13:13 and you go hey man i'm doing everything
13:15 i want because this place is about to
13:16 end
13:17 because we met the dome owners and
13:19 they're like
13:21 maybe they don't believe in a god or
13:23 something right who knows
13:26 so do whatever you want how do we
13:28 chronologically set up
13:30 a world that has three
13:33 distinct areas of construction
13:37 subterranean tunnels that are utter
13:40 utterly mind-blowing the arch was
13:43 created
13:44 in egypt not in rome
13:48 in fact the arches that protect this
13:50 beautiful box
13:52 that uncharted x just uh did a video on
13:54 about
13:55 six months ago it is the most precise
13:59 box
14:00 ever created by human hands that we've
14:02 ever found it is
14:04 utterly stunning it's purposely slanted
14:07 four inches
14:10 for one side or the other so it's got a
14:11 slope to it
14:13 i'm going to show you pictures of it as
14:16 you walk into the chamber
14:18 to get to this box there's an arch
14:23 that's mind-blowing beautiful big-ass
14:25 stones and it's a
14:27 interesting offset stone methodology of
14:30 creating an arch which
14:31 my layman's understanding of arches
14:34 built in
14:35 rome i don't know that i've ever seen
14:37 this technique used
14:38 anywhere in
14:41 the the sort of ancient world i think
14:45 i've seen it in more modern construction
14:48 but it's so it's so tough to put
14:50 together an arch that there are fail
14:52 videos out there
14:53 where people are putting together an
14:55 arch for a bridge or a
14:58 sewer system or some underground thing
15:00 and they fall
15:02 it's outside difficult they already have
15:04 custom
15:05 machines that are there to prop up
15:07 arches and these egyptians just
15:09 knock it out of the park it the other
15:12 thing that's interesting is i started
15:13 studying the
15:14 just with my eyes as i watch any type of
15:18 archaeology video the average
15:21 head room between the people walking in
15:25 to get to these exotic locations inside
15:27 pyramids or chambers
15:29 and it does look as if either
15:33 the egyptians were very or i should say
15:35 whoever built this place was very
15:36 practical and built it just
15:38 to the average height of a man and
15:41 therefore it's very close
15:43 to their heads or they built them
15:48 at that height with actual clearance for
15:50 their heads because they were smaller
15:51 people and man making these people any
15:54 smaller than us
15:55 but looking at the construction
15:57 techniques it's
15:59 freaky this box
16:02 this amazing box doesn't appear to be
16:06 capable it's all one piece of stone
16:09 it doesn't appear that there's a method
16:11 of getting the box into the chamber that
16:12 they built for it
16:14 using the hallways that people have
16:17 discovered so it looks like they put
16:19 this box there
16:21 and then built the pyramid on top of it
16:23 which is massive
16:24 it looks like a little mountain until
16:26 you get up close to it you're like oh my
16:27 god those are stones
16:29 so regardless of how you think the
16:31 pyramids were built
16:34 the more that you liken that era towards
16:37 the dynastic era
16:40 where you've got all these pharaohs
16:41 documented
16:44 this should be the talk of the town this
16:46 is what we do
16:47 we build pyramids we build hundreds of
16:49 pyramids
16:52 it should be in all of their literature
16:55 why go to such lengths to build
16:56 something gigantic
16:58 that is a world wonder in 2021 and not
17:01 document why you're building the thing
17:03 in the first place
17:04 and my gosh if you were to build it to
17:05 create power
17:08 which is what we conclusively think it
17:10 is in my circles
17:12 due to its electrical properties and its
17:14 absolute
17:16 correlation with the wharton cliff
17:18 towers and the dude from
17:19 coral castle said when asked how did you
17:22 build this place by yourself
17:24 he said i figured out how they built the
17:26 pyramids so we've got
17:28 an era where tunnels arches
17:32 amazing locations are built into the
17:34 ground we know for a fact that
17:37 the catacombs below the giza plateau and
17:41 around that general area
17:43 go down it seems like about 1600 feet
17:48 which is approaching you know a quarter
17:50 mile in the ground
17:52 i mean is your mind not automatically
17:54 blown blown by that and
17:56 when you look at the catacombs in these
17:58 places the stones
18:00 work that actually cuts a hole in the
18:01 ground so you can go down in there
18:04 there are locations where it does you
18:06 can definitely see the the tool work
18:09 the way i'm looking at it now because
18:11 the majority of those stones are
18:13 actually so freaking precise it
18:16 it makes machu picchu lay down take a
18:18 nap
18:19 the i think some of these more man-made
18:21 looking tunnels were simply
18:24 the later generations trying to dig down
18:27 to
18:28 these chambers and like any means
18:31 possible get it done
18:34 but in all cases the stone is an eight
18:37 level stone of hardness from
18:40 one to ten i don't know what one is
18:43 maybe sandstone's a one
18:45 but a tin is required to cut an eight
18:48 you can't effectively cut an eight with
18:51 a nine
18:52 you can but it would your your material
18:55 and your tools that you're trying to cut
18:56 the eight with would
18:58 shatter very quickly as i'm told
19:01 well where does 10 start
19:04 tin starts at diamonds and then you have
19:08 to mount the diamonds in some precise
19:09 way to something
19:11 and then that has to be spun it has to
19:14 be a tremendous amount of pressure
19:16 put on those drill bits in order to
19:18 cause any effect a borehole
19:21 circular saw so i've spent a close to a
19:25 week trying to have this conversation
19:26 i've been having this conversation with
19:28 people
19:30 for hours i probably spent now about
19:32 five hours having conversations about
19:34 this
19:35 idea i went back through my books
19:38 and just thumbing through a hieroglyphs
19:40 thumbing through hieroglyphs
19:42 got online looked around i do have a
19:46 tiny concern
19:47 although it's very small the people are
19:50 forging hieroglyphs using photoshop
19:53 either cutting and pasting together
19:55 shapes from other hieroglyphs that are
19:57 legitimate to create something
19:59 for us to see the famous arch
20:02 in one of the temples or one of the
20:05 homes or whatever
20:06 which apparently looks like an apache
20:08 helicopter
20:09 the explanation for that i just need to
20:12 repeat makes complete sense which is
20:15 it looks to me like a leg bone or a leg
20:17 not like bone
20:18 but a leg from the knee down is a very
20:21 common
20:23 uh hieroglyph and i forgot what it means
20:26 it's a connection of sounds and someone
20:30 then carved on top of that giving it
20:33 sort of the body of the vehicle which is
20:35 another
20:36 pretty low hanging fruit thing so when
20:38 you see the picture where they show you
20:39 the overlapping hyperglyphs i just need
20:41 you to know i've been looking at
20:43 those shapes for 25 years
20:46 and it does make complete sense so the
20:48 idea that they would have apache
20:50 helicopters of all things
20:52 negates finding something legitimate
20:56 out there that's totally different than
20:58 any of this other stuff
21:00 so it's a logic problem this is a logic
21:04 problem
21:04 even with our instant earth or reset
21:07 earth or mud flooding earth theories
21:09 which are all
21:10 different ways of saying the same thing
21:13 how do you
21:14 stack up chronologically a dynastic
21:17 period
21:18 that's writing all this stuff out
21:22 but doesn't mention the pyramids and
21:25 the writing on the side of the basal
21:27 boxes which apparent
21:28 apparently is local graffiti by some
21:32 pharaoh or something trying to claim
21:35 these boxes
21:36 as their own creation because the
21:38 hieroglyphs on the box
21:40 are extremely remedial
21:44 can't draw a straight line on a box that
21:47 is mitered perfectly
21:50 it begs two different eras to be
21:52 considered
21:54 i think these objects have been found by
21:56 modern
21:58 egyptian egyptologist especially that
22:00 nutcase that's i think now gone
22:03 god rest assault i don't know if he's
22:05 even alive he's a guy that loved
22:08 tv but they find those boxes and they
22:11 mark them up
22:13 but i need to find out when those boxes
22:15 were initially discovered because i'm
22:18 pretty sure they'd be probably
22:19 discovered in the 1940s at the latest
22:22 where do we place it let's put three
22:25 things in our head
22:27 there's the i think obvious pre-dynastic
22:31 history
22:31 which is tons of amazing
22:35 structures no writing on the walls
22:37 nothing appears to be a tomb
22:40 big giant black boxes which are
22:42 extremely oversized to be a tomb
22:45 but then there's nothing on the boxes
22:48 that
22:49 says that it's the tomb of a person
22:52 which we know
22:53 having found other antiquities
22:56 inside apparently in a valley of the
22:58 kings and valley of the queens
23:01 they went all out when someone died
23:03 especially their pharaoh
23:05 then we have the dynastic era which is
23:07 everything that we've ever been taught
23:09 that's what you're allowed to know
23:11 although i think on anakin it was
23:13 inserted into the situation
23:16 and then you have these pyramids
23:20 now if you listen to the
23:23 official history of all this stuff it
23:25 was all built between about
23:27 you get your first master buzz about
23:29 3200 bc
23:32 and then about what is it 20
23:35 2800 to 2400 bc you get all these
23:38 pyramids
23:41 and then they get attacked by a bunch of
23:42 neighboring cultures and they disappear
23:45 and but they're still there
23:49 the initial busts that go back to this
23:52 pre-dynastic era
23:54 most definitely look like african
23:58 uh genetics they have the more the
24:00 flatter nose
24:02 they have the bigger lips they have very
24:06 lush african skulls
24:09 whereas when you get to nefertiti's bust
24:12 you have a very egyptian looking
24:15 sort of i don't know what you got i
24:18 don't i don't mean to say this
24:19 uh to offend anybody but sort of what
24:21 did the
24:22 the european caucasian build a narrower
24:24 nose
24:25 uh more narrow lips and they look like
24:28 modern egyptian people
24:31 now we have to also look at some of this
24:33 and say
24:35 that there are factions in the world
24:36 that definitely want to make sure
24:39 that we get it all wrong
24:42 because they want different winners and
24:44 different losers
24:46 we know that a tremendous amount of
24:50 history has been
24:52 erased in part giant
24:56 skeletons found here in north america
24:58 have been seized
24:59 taken to the smithsonian and
25:03 lost slash stolen to erase that part of
25:07 history from us
25:08 i just found out that there's a dwarf
25:11 pygmy race
25:12 that is has been noted all over this
25:15 planet
25:17 incredible stories about them fighting
25:19 wars with birds and all kinds of stuff
25:21 especially storks
25:23 and they were from 18 inches tall to
25:25 three feet tall
25:27 in the united states we have found at
25:29 least a quarter of a million of their
25:31 graves
25:31 and their bodies again harvested by some
25:36 agency sent to england and then
25:40 stolen to make sure that
25:43 that part of history can't get
25:45 understood
25:46 we are the only things that have been
25:48 here in some cases i think it would be a
25:50 religious institution
25:53 who ripped off the virgin birth story
25:56 from previous
25:57 generations and then made it a
26:00 impair an imperative to go around and
26:02 find
26:03 other virgin birth stories like isis and
26:05 horus
26:07 queen samara miss and nimrod having
26:10 tamos
26:12 who collin got brutalized and they want
26:15 to erase it or they want you to think
26:17 that that's folklore and theirs is true
26:20 that's what i think is so funny everyone
26:22 else's religious stories
26:24 no matter how detailed they are they're
26:26 all ridiculous cartoons and yours
26:29 is true have fun meeting god okay just
26:32 have fun with that one
26:34 it negates a tremendous amount of who we
26:36 are as
26:37 human beings on this planet it further
26:39 abstracts you away from ever finding out
26:41 where we actually came from because you
26:43 can't address the puzzle pieces
26:46 because you've got a paradigm locking
26:48 down your brain and saying no no no
26:50 keep giving your stipend to the pope
26:55 it's time to be free it's time to take
26:57 what is true from those stories and
27:00 they're divine they don't have to be
27:03 true to be divine
27:05 the irony is is that a character who
27:07 spoke in parables
27:08 is a parable himself there's nothing
27:11 wrong with that
27:12 you can be a superior human being to
27:14 others
27:15 if that's your game but you know we all
27:17 want to be superior i mean in terms of
27:19 our very best version of ourself
27:21 be superior to yourself you know so
27:25 it it was documented that when the
27:27 romans
27:29 took over egypt and thank god we had the
27:31 ptolemy family
27:32 which is cleopatra's family they were
27:35 roman as well and they said look
27:37 hey don't tear this place apart
27:40 you already have done way more damage
27:42 than you should have
27:45 trying to erase history
27:48 christians went down there and defaced
27:52 hieroglyphs defaced history and then
27:56 it was blamed on pharaoh on pharaoh
28:01 re-engineering of history meaning one
28:03 pharaoh tries to erase another pharaoh's
28:06 existence and i will tell you that's a
28:08 bold-faced lie
28:10 why is that a bullface lie for several
28:13 reasons but here's your easiest one
28:16 what is a hieroglyph well it's either
28:18 paint on a wall
28:20 it's it's various colors on white
28:22 plaster
28:23 which could easily be burned off wiped
28:26 off
28:27 you could make it water soluble make it
28:28 come off replaster
28:30 you could replaster on the old one and
28:33 then write a brand new story on it
28:34 and that's how you could erase it and
28:36 there would not be a massacred wall
28:39 where someone is just throwing black
28:40 paint on the wall because they're trying
28:41 to get rid of something that was written
28:43 so that that i've never seen i've never
28:45 seen anyone play with the plaster walls
28:47 if you have let me know but the stone
28:50 relief
28:52 either being a relief
28:55 into the rock or embossment out of the
28:57 rock
28:59 would be extremely simple for these
29:02 stone masters okay to
29:06 shave down that wall and re-relief it
29:09 re-emboss it and no one would know that
29:12 the previous dude existed
29:13 that's how easy that would be what makes
29:16 sense to me
29:17 is when you see these massacred
29:20 stone hiberglyphs that have just been
29:24 brutally chipped that's an ignorant
29:27 christian going down there a white man
29:29 who has no idea how any of this stuff
29:30 was put together
29:32 and just saying get rid of that that
29:34 looks like
29:35 they don't even know how to read it at
29:36 this point right but that looks like it
29:38 might be interfering with our
29:40 story so get rid of it
29:43 okay i'm done boss what do i do now get
29:45 that one over there
29:48 and these would be not the necessary the
29:49 citizens of christianity don't get me
29:52 wrong i'm not trying to point a finger
29:53 at any one of us it's just the agents of
29:56 the jesuits or the agents of the
29:59 of the catholic church this was a giant
30:02 trillion dollar business for them to
30:05 create this religion transfer the senate
30:09 into saints which is what happened
30:13 there's 44 popes in the first face of
30:15 the catholic church
30:16 as each one of them died they all became
30:18 saints with these fake stories behind
30:21 who they were
30:22 to make them holier than thou literally
30:25 of course ascending to stand before god
30:28 in a special
30:29 i mean wow unbelievable right apparently
30:32 you weren't made equal
30:34 doesn't mean they were all bad people or
30:36 anything but that's how it went down
30:39 so we have to keep in the back of our
30:40 head at all times there are
30:42 historical revisers
30:46 they've been here forever we see it
30:49 happening in real time today
30:53 case in point i had three friends on the
30:55 capitol
30:57 steps on the 6th of january all
31:00 three of them said look man it was very
31:02 very peaceful but when i went home and
31:03 watched on tv
31:05 it was insane it was like a war zone
31:10 it was very peaceful yeah a couple
31:12 people
31:13 climbed up for a little while they said
31:15 that was only during the approach and
31:16 after everyone got there everyone calmed
31:17 down
31:18 besides beating up antifa people trying
31:20 to put pipe bombs everywhere
31:22 so it's happening real time now this is
31:25 an old game man
31:28 let's go back to our question
31:30 pre-dynasty construction that is
31:33 mind-blowing some of what we can do
31:35 today and
31:36 some of it we can't do today but we have
31:40 always put in the last year on this show
31:43 we've always put the pyramids in the
31:44 pre-dynastic time frame
31:46 we put the sphinx in the pre-dynastic
31:49 era because of graham hancock's
31:51 incredible research
31:52 with a bunch of other people coming to
31:54 the same conclusion
31:55 he probably bit his conclusion off other
31:57 people's conclusion and there's nothing
31:59 wrong with that
32:01 that the last time the constellation
32:03 orion would have been
32:05 in direct sight of the sphinx would have
32:06 been 3500 bc
32:09 these pyramids are not
32:12 mortared rocks like the normal brick
32:15 wall that you see
32:16 that's a part of any structure in your
32:18 town right these things are laid in
32:20 place
32:21 on top of each other there's theories
32:24 about
32:25 the rocks being poured into place which
32:27 is absurd
32:29 and you know it's funny because i i see
32:33 channels that i really respect
32:35 and they will go after these theories
32:37 and and just to make them click bait
32:40 will start to tell you that there's
32:41 validity and theories that there's no
32:43 validity in
32:44 but what they do is they put their
32:46 fingers in their ears when they actually
32:47 talk to people who know what this
32:50 is all about and they go off and talk to
32:52 some official science
32:54 conspiracy theorists you would say
32:57 and just construct something to milk you
33:00 and that's why their videos are so short
33:02 because they can get in and out real
33:04 quick
33:05 short videos
33:08 is in short segments is the way that the
33:10 press has been gagging
33:12 us forever bringing people on new shows
33:15 and having six minute conversations
33:18 about something like 911 and
33:21 the host talks for four minutes the
33:23 guest who can prove that
33:24 there's some fishiness going on gets to
33:26 talk for two the second that the guest
33:28 gets to something that is
33:30 against the narrative the host jumps in
33:32 and attacks them
33:33 and then says hey i'm glad you're on the
33:34 show see you later boom and then i'm
33:36 sorry we're out of time sorry we're out
33:38 of time
33:41 it's a technique twitter started with
33:43 140 characters right
33:46 you don't think that was a scientific
33:48 technique of shortening your attention
33:49 span
33:51 think again would have went to 280 after
33:54 that or something like that
33:55 the feature was already in facebook the
33:58 feature was already and i think
34:00 uh myspace leaving a comment it's called
34:03 a
34:04 it's called a forum man except it's the
34:06 short attention span forum
34:09 how do we place this on a piece of paper
34:12 historically we got a timeline
34:16 where these incredible structures exist
34:19 here comes this big
34:20 articulated phonetic
34:25 symbology called hiberglyphs ancient
34:28 arabic writing
34:30 and it misses the boat well
34:34 the easy way to put this on paper but it
34:36 doesn't make any sense
34:38 is that those dynastic era people
34:42 went first the writing
34:46 went first and then
34:49 all this other stuff happened second and
34:52 when i say all this other stuff we're
34:54 talking about a ton of stuff
34:57 a ton of stuff would have had to go
35:00 after
35:02 but like the basal boxes having
35:05 sort of uh short bust writing on it
35:09 it begs the opposite thing
35:12 hey man if you had a phonetic language
35:14 and you had a method of writing and
35:15 you're able
35:16 to create a bath salt box that's
35:17 absolutely the most mind-blowingly
35:19 perfect structure and there's a bunch of
35:20 them
35:21 you're gonna get those hybrid gloves
35:22 down pat
35:25 statues of jekyll statues of lions with
35:27 rib cages
35:28 and correct proportions
35:31 uh some of the statues of humans sitting
35:34 like like me sitting here you know
35:36 it's amazing how they would get the face
35:40 absolutely perfect in the structure you
35:42 could flay it in photoshop you know take
35:43 the left side and merit on the right
35:45 side and it's exactly
35:46 what's there it doesn't just work of
35:49 course we know that would work
35:50 but typically if i took my face and made
35:53 the left side look like the right side
35:55 and showed you guys the photograph it
35:57 might take you 10 seconds but you'd
35:59 realize
35:59 oh i see he's got that little dot there
36:01 and it's over here too
36:03 this is why this looks so strange so in
36:06 some cases part of the statues are
36:07 amazing looking
36:09 and in other circumstances the
36:12 proportions are a little
36:13 wonky we can see the evolution within
36:17 hyperglyphs
36:18 as i said a long time ago if you go back
36:21 to the older
36:23 supposedly older writing the pharaohs
36:27 themselves are much darker
36:29 the ink or whatever paint they created
36:31 to create themselves was darker and
36:33 darker and darker
36:34 and as you go closer and closer to our
36:36 time apparently
36:38 we have lighter and lighter skin and
36:40 what's sort of fascinating is
36:43 the help is often still dark
36:47 so you'll see like you know the fanning
36:49 of pharaoh
36:50 holding a light bulb those folks
36:53 remained darker
36:57 who knows if that's even a
37:00 slave situation i mean some of that
37:02 stuff is if you're in the middle of
37:05 i don't know 10 000 bc and you got a job
37:08 working for the
37:09 for the pharaoh who's obviously feeding
37:11 you clothing you and sheltering you
37:14 it it's probably not what we call
37:15 slavery you're an assistant
37:18 to someone who's the most famous person
37:22 in your area the most powerful person in
37:24 your area
37:26 doesn't always have to go to kuntikente
37:29 man
37:30 so let's start talking about some
37:32 radical theories
37:34 here's one that blows me away uh just to
37:37 just to set you up in your brain
37:39 especially those og listeners
37:41 i'm only gonna say a couple sentences so
37:43 don't worry i set off to prove that
37:45 roswell crass was fake
37:47 and ended up becoming a forever believer
37:50 unless someone pulls me aside from the
37:53 military and explains it all to me and
37:54 shows me all this stuff and i
37:56 can ask a million questions and it all
37:57 makes sense when i was a kid
38:01 especially leonard nimoy i think had his
38:03 show history's mysteries or something
38:04 like that
38:06 it started in the 70s that the pyramids
38:10 were built by aliens
38:12 that the giza plateau was a runway for
38:15 spaceships which is
38:16 hilarious because yeah they're going to
38:18 come in on wheels
38:21 it could be a landing pad i guess but
38:22 that's if you have a spaceship you could
38:24 probably land a lot of different places
38:26 but they having a nice solid platform
38:28 makes sense to me
38:30 and then what's strange about it when
38:32 you hear this stuff and you're like five
38:34 to ten years old
38:36 unfortunately that goes in your brain is
38:38 truth
38:40 like i thought king arthur really
38:41 existed
38:44 until i grow up you know i thought that
38:46 when i was a kid that you could fly
38:47 like superman around the world backwards
38:49 and you'd reverse time
38:51 you know like comic books are real when
38:54 you're children
38:56 and so obviously as i got just a
38:58 slightly older
39:00 the idea that these were built by
39:01 pyramid or by aliens excuse me
39:04 started to dwindle off and then when i
39:06 bought books about it
39:08 which laid out the internal construction
39:10 of how the stones were
39:12 laid out it looked very man-made
39:16 looked brilliant but it looked man-made
39:19 now i'm just going to throw you a
39:23 screenwriter's fun
39:26 interpretation of this information
39:30 but sometimes you got to do that you got
39:32 to throw a dart in them at a wall with
39:34 some stuff on the wall as a target
39:36 in the middle of the blackness of the
39:39 room right you just got no light you're
39:40 just going to throw it like a having a
39:41 blindfold on
39:43 i'm convinced for scientific reasons
39:45 that these pyramids generated
39:47 power the pyramids were the catalysts
39:50 like the first tesla coil
39:51 using colorado springs by tesla
39:54 to start to siphon you know you've got
39:58 to
39:58 got to get some push going in i mean we
40:00 do pull out on it too but
40:02 if you want to do it the way he did it
40:04 you push a little bit of power in
40:07 but you also have a unit that's going to
40:09 pull out
40:10 it's your ground tesla someone's your
40:13 positive circuit and one's your negative
40:15 circuit going up
40:17 because it's built on knock ravine
40:19 because it has a catacomb of water in
40:20 the plateau
40:22 you are siphoning the earth's plasma
40:26 into this
40:28 water and then you can anywhere on the
40:31 plateau you can put a steel rod down
40:33 and they've got lead or excuse me they
40:35 have iron from meteorites in the desert
40:37 and they can build
40:38 staffs out of it and they can put that
40:40 down and boom you've pulled up enough
40:41 power to
40:42 get something to happen and it's all dc
40:45 current
40:46 so imagine you've got this dynastic era
40:49 that's been put in place
40:50 by our creators
40:54 this is a layer of folks between us
40:57 and what you might think is the ultimate
40:59 creator of like a god
41:02 it could be dome owners it could be
41:04 aliens
41:06 they probably look like us or some
41:08 derivative thereof
41:11 but they have put the egyptians there or
41:14 whoever these people were
41:16 use the african people to first do it
41:20 and then maybe over time
41:21 blending in with other cultures it
41:23 siphons out to
41:24 to be modern egyptology or sorry
41:27 egyptian dna
41:29 that we see today but that generation
41:34 dies off somehow for whatever reason
41:38 but our captors come back to either
41:43 pardon the pun recharge the area
41:47 it's died out they
41:51 build this weird stuff they
41:56 and the thing is like be fun little
41:58 sci-fi stories say
41:59 they built the pyramids to recharge
42:01 their equipment
42:02 to leave or they built the pyramids to
42:04 charge the equipment
42:05 to to cut stone or to do whatever they
42:08 needed to do
42:10 to build another culture or imagine just
42:12 you know
42:14 what happens when you buy a fish let's
42:16 go to that
42:17 you buy a tank first you buy the rocks
42:20 you buy a little scenery
42:22 you buy a pump you buy some oxygenated
42:24 thingy right
42:26 then you go get your fish and you put
42:28 them in the tank
42:30 once you've measured all the water all
42:32 the ph is perfect
42:34 then you put them inside we know that
42:38 man was first most densely
42:42 present in the tip of africa
42:45 and south europe just look at
42:49 rome being where rome is where greece
42:52 was
42:53 where egypt is
42:56 per capita of people on earth
42:59 and doing all things both sophisticated
43:01 not sophisticated they were in those
43:03 areas
43:04 the the sheer layers of civilizations
43:06 that we're still discovering
43:09 and we won't even be close to
43:11 discovering all these civilizations in
43:12 our lifetime
43:14 that's what's nuts we're going to die if
43:16 you live to be 100 years old
43:18 the majority of previous civilizations
43:20 will be underground
43:21 undiscovered i mean maybe if there's a
43:24 miraculous piece of equipment
43:26 that's created where it can scan the
43:28 bowels of earth
43:29 and give you back a full 3d picture from
43:32 sonogram data that comes up
43:34 derived from echoes and all that kind of
43:36 stuff
43:37 yeah maybe but i'm starting to think
43:41 you know we're almost at the point of
43:43 re-igniting the alien theory
43:46 now forget again all the implementations
43:48 that you've seen in movies
43:50 like what is it stargate and where the
43:52 spaceship lands on top of the
43:54 pyramids that is probably one of the
43:58 best
44:00 fun stories about what those things
44:02 could have been but you find
44:04 pictures online and pictures and videos
44:07 where they were spaceships themselves
44:09 and the only problem with that is
44:10 obviously these are stones that are
44:13 simply laid into place
44:14 if you try to vibrate it move it turn it
44:16 sideways the whole thing would fall off
44:18 like
44:19 someone with a plate of pasta rotating
44:21 too quickly
44:22 and it all ends up on the floor which
44:24 i've done
44:26 with a bunch of sauce on top on a white
44:28 carpet when i was about 12.
44:32 that stain stayed there forever
44:35 it just seems that these things may have
44:36 been built
44:38 fairly quickly as to account for
44:42 a lack of massive civilization that it
44:44 would take
44:45 to put them together because think about
44:47 it
44:48 they're you know the first theories when
44:50 i was a kid but again it's it's to
44:52 accentuate moses is to accentuate
44:57 african people bad everyone else and
44:59 europe is totally civilized which is
45:02 we built europe without slaves and the
45:05 people down south had to use slaves they
45:07 were cruel
45:08 primitives they're savages remember uh
45:11 the doctor who show kinder or
45:15 james cameron's full rip-off called
45:17 avatar
45:19 that's the game kenda was 1982
45:22 avatar is 2007 exact same story that's
45:26 where avatar came from
45:27 go watch it and your jaw be on the
45:29 ground if you think not
45:30 a hanging crystal tree forest i mean
45:34 you'll see it but they use all the same
45:35 scenes the same dialogue someone just
45:38 ripped off the doctor who episode
45:40 and converted it up without much
45:42 creativity
45:44 except the cg but if you have a
45:47 bunch of people because it's three three
45:49 three different theories
45:51 you have a slave race that works for
45:53 hundreds and hundreds if not
45:54 thousands of years building all these
45:56 pyramids which makes complete sense
45:58 doesn't it
45:59 125 bend pyramids a bunch of pyramids
46:02 that just look like mountains
46:04 and then you have the beautiful ones in
46:05 giza which has a bunch of little
46:08 cousins all over the ground then you
46:10 have someone saying well
46:12 about late 90s the theory started coming
46:15 out that maybe they weren't slaves maybe
46:17 they were just the people
46:18 and it was just what they did
46:23 that they weren't slaves and they
46:25 thought without knowing how the pyramids
46:27 were built
46:27 they reduced the number of years it took
46:29 to build the giza pyramids by quite a
46:31 bit
46:32 saying hey you could do this whole thing
46:33 in 20 years
46:35 when people do the math on how many
46:37 stones are in these
46:40 these projects they then multiply that
46:44 times how much time it would take to
46:45 quarry transport and position the stone
46:48 precisely of course and they multiply it
46:52 times 2.3 2.5 million just for the great
46:54 pyramid and then they start going oh
46:56 yeah it's probably gonna be way more
46:57 than
46:58 20 years and it's way more years than
47:00 any pharaoh that claims to have been the
47:02 um
47:04 the catalyst to the project so you've
47:06 got slaves taken forever
47:09 citizens that love it reducing the time
47:11 quite a bit
47:13 without any scientific explanation of
47:15 how to do that and then
47:16 you've got alien drop-off stuff
47:20 aliens putting this thing together hmm
47:25 and then you have and i i tried to look
47:27 up eric dubay's
47:29 former episode about
47:33 the fact that he thinks these pyramids
47:35 were built in the 1800s
47:38 because i thought oh maybe the person
47:40 who put the comment the comment section
47:42 maybe they that's a factoid that uh eric
47:45 put in his video because i
47:47 it's been a long time since i've seen it
47:49 so i went to his channel that's online
47:51 and i surfed through god
47:55 every video till it stopped and there
47:57 was nothing about egypt in there
48:00 and i mean i found the dinosaur one i
48:02 found
48:03 80 of the videos are all flat earth
48:05 stuff
48:06 and so maybe he had a change of heart
48:08 don't know maybe he wants to re-edit it
48:10 maybe that's the video that got him
48:11 kicked off maybe it was censored you
48:13 know
48:13 pulled off his playlist which was videos
48:16 up there that say that his playlists
48:17 have been
48:18 destroyed or censored and whatever
48:22 the idea that the 1800s would have been
48:24 a place where these pyramids were built
48:26 is negated by two major factors
48:30 there's probably thousands of factors
48:33 but at least two
48:35 one the area by that time was extremely
48:38 populated
48:40 there were dudes living there
48:42 documenting it
48:43 like crazy uncharted x cites this guy
48:47 whose name's petrie his last name is
48:51 petrie dr petry
48:52 if it weren't for him we wouldn't have a
48:54 tremendous amount of the knowledge we
48:56 have about these areas
48:57 and his writings are now being
49:00 legitimized
49:01 because what happened was he writes all
49:02 this logical stuff
49:05 studying things for years i think he
49:07 spent over 20 years down there
49:09 and then the royal academy of sciences
49:12 which is your revisionistic history
49:14 headquarters of the world probably was
49:17 in rome initially
49:18 now it's in england they pooh-pooh all
49:21 of petrie's stuff
49:22 for the most part and they'll pooh-pooh
49:25 stuff without ever going to look at the
49:27 original thing that he sat on top of
49:29 physically for perhaps a decade
49:32 unreal and then we have the rediscovery
49:35 of petrie
49:36 with a bunch of people with video
49:37 cameras plenty of resources
49:39 plenty of internet communication with
49:41 brilliant scientists
49:43 and who go back in and prove that petrie
49:45 was right
49:46 the fact that we have to go through this
49:48 is nauseating
49:51 i hope in the next 12 months if the
49:53 world does a reset in a good way
49:55 that all these people could be labeled
49:57 as heretics
49:59 and the worst traitors to the human race
50:03 because that's what they are either that
50:05 are just exceptionally
50:07 ignorant and we just need to put them in
50:08 a padded room
50:11 the secondary thing besides people
50:13 eyewitnessing
50:14 all of this creation you got ansel adams
50:18 running around
50:19 yosemite park taking the most
50:21 breathtaking pictures in the late 1800s
50:24 plus the world's busy there's wars being
50:27 fought
50:28 they're trying to conquer africa for all
50:31 of its minerals and materials and
50:33 orchestrating genocides and you know
50:35 it's a very busy place
50:37 but how is it that somehow okay
50:40 they were able to mine out of the ground
50:42 or quarry out of the ground
50:44 all of this rock with the most
50:47 sophisticated
50:48 stone cutting tools that we don't have
50:52 today
50:53 why would that be the case was it that
50:56 dean guy i believe
50:58 if i have his name right he's the guy
51:00 that's the united states expert on stone
51:02 cutting
51:03 not controlled by a queen he's the guy
51:06 that is a key instrument in
51:07 re-certifying petrie's findings
51:11 but they brought him over there and they
51:13 try to drill a hole in a rock
51:15 they showed him all these statues they
51:17 showed him the pyramids
51:19 there's the pyramid code documentary
51:20 which is phenomenal with a bunch of
51:22 other
51:22 independent scientists that are not
51:24 egyptologists looking at the pyramids
51:26 after a month of analysis they said man
51:28 i wouldn't want to be in this thing when
51:29 it's turned on
51:31 so i would have to see some artifact
51:35 that has been discovered that is ancient
51:39 and i mean ancient that
51:42 could do all this work in
51:45 any of the history that we have
51:47 discovered to this point let alone the
51:49 1800s
51:51 now imagine let's go back to the alien
51:54 theory
51:56 they show up and they have to do
51:58 something
52:00 i don't want to think too small because
52:02 if they
52:03 show up to planet earth then they most
52:06 likely have a methods of
52:07 of traveling interstellarly or again if
52:10 we're in a petri dish
52:12 with a dome over the top they're on the
52:14 other side
52:16 they don't want to bring a bunch of
52:17 things in
52:19 that could be lost
52:22 they also have to be careful of building
52:24 anything that defies the materials that
52:26 are available here on earth
52:28 so they would build something out of
52:31 everything that we have here
52:33 perhaps using tools that don't get lost
52:36 because they're too big
52:38 you know if you bought a big giant uh
52:40 was a 350 ton earth mover
52:44 you're not going to lose that thing hey
52:45 make sure and get that thing out here
52:46 yeah yeah
52:47 we're loading it up two hours we'll be
52:49 out here all right see you back at base
52:51 high five boom
52:52 but it would beg the question just like
52:55 all the star trek episodes where they
52:57 land on a planet they bring a bunch of
52:59 stuff down
53:00 it's a temporary stay in some cases they
53:03 thought they were going to be stranded
53:05 and they start setting up shop
53:08 still trying to hang on to the prime
53:09 directive wherever they possibly can
53:12 it's one of these things if you had
53:14 anti-gravity
53:16 capabilities and you have the ability to
53:19 quickly cut rock
53:21 then you could create a scenario where
53:24 these things could be put together
53:26 almost with an automated drone system
53:28 you know if you think about it
53:30 but the other thing is um
53:33 the sort of counter alien theory
53:37 would be that we should consider that
53:39 they would be operating on a global
53:40 basis
53:41 regardless of what shape you think this
53:43 place is
53:45 there's pyramids in south america china
53:48 turkey south africa they're all over the
53:51 place
53:52 i don't believe there's anything in
53:53 north america
53:56 correct me if you know different i don't
53:57 believe there's anything in russia
54:00 correct me if you know different that
54:02 doesn't mean there's not amazing
54:03 structures in these places that also
54:04 blow the mind of pieces
54:06 but in terms of pyramids it seems
54:11 like these are pretty well distributed
54:12 around the world however the schematic
54:14 of them
54:15 is drastically different
54:19 which automatically
54:22 accredits man for these things
54:26 of course it gets more elaborate when
54:27 you come to south america
54:29 so you build them in egypt initially
54:34 and for a while a bent pyramid is the
54:36 thing to do now what i don't know about
54:39 all these pyramids that are not in the
54:40 giza plateau
54:42 is whether or not any of them are on a
54:44 plateau
54:46 whether or not any of them are
54:47 generating electricity
54:49 whether or not the gentleman who was in
54:51 the pyramid code who was the
54:54 the um i guess i don't want to say he's
54:56 a he's an electrical engineer
54:58 he said okay everything's there to make
55:00 it a warden cliff tower to
55:02 create a big chunk of electricity
55:05 but what about all these other places i
55:07 don't believe he was going to the other
55:09 locations
55:10 i don't believe in my research i've seen
55:14 too many pyramids outside the giza
55:16 plateau that have any type of plateau
55:17 underneath them but it seems like that
55:19 would be necessary
55:20 such that if you build on like soil
55:24 sand you're going to get
55:27 settling that's why we pile dry before
55:30 we build skyscrapers
55:31 that's why china has big giant apartment
55:33 complexes just falling over
55:35 because they don't believe in
55:39 science i don't know architecture
55:41 they're getting it down
55:42 obviously because hong kong is
55:44 tremendous
55:46 built in sort of an aquatic aquatic
55:49 collection of islands
55:51 they got it down now but they had some
55:53 rough roads there initially
55:57 but you go to south america and the
55:59 pyramids are
56:01 are well the discovered pyramids okay
56:03 you have these steps on them
56:05 they're very elaborate compared to the
56:08 giza ones but when i was like i said one
56:11 of my producers from my video game
56:12 company
56:13 he flies down there all the time he was
56:16 on a big mountain looking
56:18 at the official pyramids
56:21 and his guide said you know there's a
56:22 ton of pyramids here they just haven't
56:26 told the public and they're bigger than
56:27 those down there
56:29 and my buddy goes well show me and the
56:32 guy said well you're standing on one of
56:34 them right now
56:36 and he takes a look around and he goes
56:37 yeah right this is extremely intelligent
56:40 dude okay
56:41 and he said well let me show you and he
56:42 takes him around the corner and starts
56:44 showing him stones that this place is
56:46 made out of
56:49 okay it is
56:53 beyond my capacity
56:56 to believe that the sheer amount of
57:00 catacombs tunnels
57:05 boxes
57:08 fluted pillars statues of people
57:14 the official giza pyramids all the other
57:17 pyramids
57:19 could have been created extremely
57:22 quickly
57:25 meaning beyond anyone's expectations
57:27 right
57:28 one year or something like that unless
57:31 someone
57:32 were to come up with some crash
57:34 spaceship
57:35 that was also discovered in the catacomb
57:37 you know
57:39 the other big question about sort of an
57:41 alien drop-off theory
57:43 which our dna suggests in several
57:45 different levels right
57:48 is the utter distribution of human
57:51 form all around the world
57:55 yes there's pygmies apparently in
57:58 pretty much every single continent maybe
58:00 maybe australia doesn't have them
58:03 but we have all this you know gnomes
58:07 we have leprechaun theories
58:11 but the amount of art i saw in this one
58:13 recent anthropology
58:14 anthropological video i saw
58:17 was tremendous i mean there's mosaics in
58:20 europe of these
58:22 of this dwarf race fighting these birds
58:24 it's written in
58:26 old tales from greek
58:29 to roman tales but
58:33 finding over a quarter of a million of
58:35 these graves in the united states of
58:36 america alone is mind-blowing
58:38 a friend of mine was telling me he
58:41 couldn't remember the location but
58:42 apparently in
58:43 south africa or she's south america
58:46 not too far over the border they found a
58:49 big
58:50 grave of a bunch of large
58:53 giant humans they excavated it took it
58:57 into
58:58 i guess america or some other official
59:00 location maybe mexico city or something
59:02 started you know looking at these
59:04 someone comes grabs them
59:07 and then the country locked down the
59:08 location said you can't go back and find
59:10 any more
59:13 when because they know they found a ton
59:14 and they only took a few they're still
59:16 there
59:17 probably being excavated and moved away
59:19 to make sure
59:20 whoever's running this place is trying
59:23 to temper
59:24 the cross-pollination between previous
59:26 generations of experimentation on this
59:28 planet
59:29 and us because what would be
59:32 what would be the harm i mean seriously
59:34 what would be the harm
59:36 in us finding a bunch of large 13-foot
59:39 to 25-foot human bones
59:43 what's going to be the big deal the
59:45 religious institutions will simply say
59:47 these are god's people from the past
59:49 they were taller bigger lived 800 years
59:51 they're not going to prom with it the
59:53 pygmies the tiny ones
59:55 18 inch tall fully formed human i should
59:58 say that
59:58 these graves that they found of all
60:00 these bodies between 18 and 30
60:03 36 inches their skulls were completely
60:06 sealed
60:06 so they weren't children apparently they
60:09 were all buried with this little tiny
60:11 black box that inside had a
60:16 shell and the shell was pretty much
60:20 transparent with two colors
60:22 so one the outside color was different
60:24 than the inside color
60:26 and they weren't sure where this shell
60:27 came from it didn't seem to match
60:31 any known shellfish that we have today
60:33 and they said that the shell was
60:35 absolutely one thousand percent
60:36 preserved
60:38 so you know doctors and scientists came
60:41 to
60:42 these locations one of them was a six
60:43 acre site in
60:45 in tennessee and this this guy
60:48 published in his video i'll probably do
60:52 a video on this whole thing but
60:53 you know probably a dozen new york times
60:56 articles about this stuff this isn't
60:58 fringy stuff
61:00 but it seems like there's a force out
61:02 there it's like when you see ufo black
61:05 suits show up and say no no no you
61:06 didn't see that
61:08 and they make you assign a um you know
61:11 non-disclosure while you're young
61:13 full of energy and your brain's working
61:15 really great
61:16 and then once you get to 50 60 70 oh now
61:19 you can talk about it and no one listens
61:20 to you because you're an old man
61:23 that's my gut feeling so why
61:26 would anything be left behind
61:30 that's the other big question if you
61:31 talk about this resetting the earth
61:33 thing
61:34 either by alien intervention especially
61:37 not god intervention it doesn't make any
61:38 sense
61:40 you might have a situation where someone
61:42 says look how beautiful this culture was
61:44 or maybe well
61:48 the thing is is if you read hiberglyphs
61:51 there's nothing that
61:52 says you know can't wait to get back
61:54 home to my home world or get out of this
61:56 dome
61:56 container and go see the misses and pat
61:59 the kids on the head or something
62:01 there's none of that talk it is the talk
62:03 of standard egyptology
62:05 pharaohs and successors and
62:09 murders and hunting and rituals
62:12 it's all pretty pretty above board i
62:14 mean that's a lot of work if it's all
62:16 fake
62:18 i don't think it's fake i think it's
62:20 real
62:22 but if all this amazing construction is
62:24 sitting around those people
62:26 my god i mean we got
62:30 millionaires in the united states of
62:31 america that retire to a community
62:33 called santa fe new mexico
62:36 and they buy a home with their money
62:39 they
62:39 balance all their retirement and their
62:41 payments and everything and then they go
62:43 out and paint
62:45 that's how we discovered chemtrails they
62:48 had been painting for
62:50 i don't know 100 years in that area if
62:52 you were rich you just set up shop there
62:54 in the late 90s the sky
62:57 turned into these dust clouds so they
63:00 wrote the
63:01 the air force and said hey could you let
63:03 us know when you're going to pollute the
63:05 sky with your plane so that we can not
63:07 come on those days because you're
63:08 screwing up all of our painting
63:10 and they said we're not doing nothing
63:12 107 says it's a
63:15 it's a defense shield against incoming
63:18 ballistic missiles
63:19 okay buddy whatever because we're just
63:22 on the brink of nuclear war
63:24 right i'm gonna do a new update on the
63:27 chemtrails thing coming up here
63:30 so rest assured we won't skip over
63:31 anything
63:33 the other title i thought was called
63:34 call it the egyptian paradox
63:36 maybe that's a better title this is
63:38 rocking my brain
63:41 if someone hired me to write a movie
63:42 that says okay this is
63:45 you know they we have this producer
63:47 meeting they go okay you know about this
63:48 right yeah you know about that
63:49 pre-dynastic boxes yep and you know
63:51 about the dynastic area yep and you've
63:53 read all
63:54 uh graham hancock's books listed all of
63:56 his interviews plus everyone else that's
63:57 in his camp brian forrester the
63:59 uncharted x guy
64:01 pyramid code people we got all their
64:03 phone numbers you can talk to them as
64:04 much as you want
64:06 but now you gotta explain why there are
64:08 giant pyramids everywhere
64:10 and it's not just a common thing and all
64:11 the hyperglyphs i mean it should be
64:14 a ton of hieroglyphs you have
64:16 hyperglyphs where they drag
64:17 stones and they're pouring water in
64:19 front of a sled but no destination of
64:21 where these things are going
64:24 you have quarries where we can see very
64:27 man
64:28 made you know scrape marks to build the
64:31 obelisks
64:32 and yes somehow they get these things
64:34 absolutely smoothed out once they're dug
64:35 out of the earth
64:37 but we also have circular saw mistakes
64:39 on boxes where they went a little too
64:41 acute
64:42 with their angle and they abandoned the
64:44 box and the lid still stuck to the box
64:48 they have a whole pyramid built around
64:49 this precise box that uncharted x just
64:51 covered
64:52 it's just an amazing thing
64:56 and i guess we should suggest for a
64:59 split second
65:01 that this is kind of an absurd theory
65:04 but
65:05 imagine all of this mishmash of history
65:07 and time
65:09 is a logic test for us or
65:13 in a consensus reality reality where
65:16 we're just agreeing on what is reality
65:19 and this is all fake i mean it's real
65:22 but it's fake
65:24 we've just imagined this place
65:27 that our power to imagine
65:31 objects into existence and a paradigm
65:34 that we call flesh and blood
65:36 we our souls are imagining this together
65:39 that
65:39 this is actually a dream sort of and we
65:42 forgot
65:44 to put the pyramids into the hieroglyphs
65:48 and now it's just stuck because that's
65:50 what everybody knows
65:52 but yeah someone that's that's how i'd
65:53 write the movie probably if someone said
65:55 you got to make all this make sense
65:58 be like how deep do you want to go bro
66:01 these structures had purpose these
66:02 structures are not tombs
66:05 they're just not they're not made by the
66:07 pharaohs that
66:08 pulled out the keystone and wrote their
66:11 name on it
66:13 and just remember like we talked about
66:14 revisionistic history for a second
66:18 when i first saw um
66:21 because they love to make everybody
66:22 savages but us you know
66:24 the modern people doesn't matter what
66:26 race you are if you're in a first world
66:28 country
66:28 then you're in us but they always want
66:31 to make everyone else look stupid
66:33 primitive evil so if they need to wipe
66:36 them out and genocide them well you've
66:37 got 100 years 200 years
66:39 thousand years of making these people as
66:41 savages
66:42 but south america and all the human
66:45 sacrifices
66:46 into these fiery pits that are at the
66:48 top of these step pyramids
66:51 when i finally looked up the
66:55 quote-unquote evidence of this being the
66:58 case it was a european man's
67:01 painting on a stone
67:04 where a guy you know looking like the
67:06 locals holding up a baby and they got
67:08 like little blood drops coming off of
67:10 the body
67:10 very european go look at art
67:13 appreciation videos would you
67:14 so you know when white men from europe
67:17 painted exactly like this so when you
67:19 see it you're like oh my god
67:21 there it is somebody got angry at me i
67:24 think in a comment
67:25 many years ago and said oh yeah well
67:28 i've seen all the
67:30 baby skulls in some pit
67:34 proof that that was a human sacrifice
67:37 pit of fire well
67:41 maybe you mean what was it
67:44 christopher columbus was being chased by
67:46 the queen queen's men for being a
67:48 pedophile before he died
67:50 okay well what if they're uh
67:54 you should know that uh what is it a um
67:58 a pyre i don't know what they call it
68:01 when you put a body on a bunch of uh
68:04 wood and you you do a viking
68:07 death you light it on fire of course
68:09 they usually put in a boat viking times
68:11 and send it out into the water which is
68:13 a gorgeous idea cremation right into the
68:16 lake naturally i think that's pretty
68:19 amazing
68:20 if those skulls were truly uh existing
68:23 all the way to the point where we can
68:25 take a photograph in the 21st century or
68:27 20th century
68:28 then i think you should probably check
68:30 sort of some logic there
68:32 but two as far as we know if that's real
68:36 when a baby dies let's just say because
68:39 it's a primitive
68:40 more time i mean everywhere in the world
68:42 this kind of thing happened
68:44 some some sickness comes through
68:47 bacterial
68:48 rat based uh pluggy kind of thing comes
68:50 through or they just
68:52 simply still birth or something what if
68:53 it's a ritual to honor the child and
68:55 it's a pyre
68:57 type experience at the top of the
68:58 pyramid it's like you lost your
69:01 you know the the priest comes to the
69:02 family and says i you know you lost your
69:04 baby you know it's really
69:06 tough right and she's just destroyed you
69:08 know
69:09 maybe you know we're much more emotional
69:11 today perhaps because we put a lot more
69:13 around it but
69:14 they're very spiritual people back in
69:15 the days very um
69:18 you in some case pluralistic believers
69:20 they believe there's many gods handling
69:22 all
69:22 the different issues but to honor this
69:25 child and take away a little bit of pain
69:27 the high priest you know takes it to the
69:29 top in front of everybody man it's it's
69:31 a
69:32 it's kind of a celebration of life but
69:34 it's also a
69:35 morn time to mourn and that baby gets
69:40 burned up right there because it's
69:41 already gone but they cremate it that
69:43 way and they live
69:44 they leave the the ashes there
69:47 thinking that perhaps god makes bones
69:50 stay behind
69:51 for some enchanted reason for all you
69:53 know they gave
69:54 the mother a particular bone to say
69:58 this is what you keep you put this in
70:00 your home and when you want to say hi to
70:02 your
70:02 child it passed this is where you that's
70:05 how you do it you know you put together
70:06 some little
70:07 thing like the japanese do where they
70:09 have little shrines to people who have
70:11 passed
70:11 i think it's absolutely gorgeous belief
70:13 man
70:15 i'm just saying it's pretty flimsy stuff
70:19 and considering that this storyline has
70:22 proliferated through time
70:24 of calling other people savages that's
70:26 what we call the native americans man
70:29 oh they're savages they're savages
70:32 they just didn't like us taking their
70:34 land and so they fought back and boy as
70:36 soon as they fought back their savages
70:39 they were so kind to the settlers as
70:42 documented by the settlers
70:44 indian giving that's that's a white
70:47 thing not a black not a
70:48 native american thing scalping was first
70:51 done by the white man
70:52 and so the the native americans just
70:55 returned the favor man they said oh this
70:57 is the way you do it huh
70:58 it's a non-fatal way to uh send a
71:01 message
71:02 poof they got better at it than than the
71:05 native
71:06 or sorry than the invaders right but
71:08 isn't it amazing that
71:12 the pyramid in china with all those
71:14 amazing soldier
71:16 sculptures in the basement where every
71:18 single face is different every single
71:19 person is unique
71:22 why did i learn about that in my 30s i
71:25 mean i know
71:26 they just you know was it gave
71:28 permission to go inside right
71:30 all right so we didn't know what was
71:32 inside
71:34 somebody knew what was inside over there
71:37 it's not a tourist attraction
71:39 but why didn't somebody say to the rest
71:42 of the world yeah there's pyramids
71:44 everywhere why is that you know
71:48 i just think it shows you that those in
71:50 authority to bring you this information
71:53 are not that intelligent
71:56 they just aren't they know what they
71:59 need to know
72:00 based on their perceived need to to
72:02 analyze something right
72:05 and so you know a true archaeologist if
72:08 we were to say
72:11 you were to be skilled in all things
72:13 that archaeology can
72:15 can dig out of the ground then a true
72:18 archaeologist would have to be a
72:20 paleontologist
72:22 put a little tongue in cheek there and
72:24 they would have to be
72:26 structural engineers they'd have to be
72:28 architects
72:29 as as the new discoveries in egypt
72:32 they'd have to be electrical engineers
72:34 they have to know everything about
72:36 anthropology
72:39 to truly contribute to what they're
72:41 actually doing
72:42 physically digging things out of the
72:44 ground carefully gritting out a dig
72:47 photographing it not destroying the
72:49 items as they dig them out of the ground
72:51 i mean it seems like an archaeologist is
72:55 just a ditch digger
72:56 for an anthropologist or all the other
72:59 disciplines that might
73:02 analyze what's actually coming out of
73:03 the ground but what happens
73:05 in this society and has happened your
73:07 entire life
73:08 the authorities that talk to you about
73:10 what they find
73:12 and all of the explanations of what they
73:14 find are the archaeologists themselves
73:17 and then you get into all the deception
73:21 all the deception of these guys to get
73:23 funds for what they do
73:25 they make up things to get funds that's
73:27 why the two first two guys that invented
73:28 paleontology to find
73:30 these non-existent things called
73:32 dinosaurs they lied
73:34 for 40 years came up with 136 species of
73:38 dinosaurs where today
73:39 only 32 of them are said to be actually
73:42 in existence
73:44 and these are still the founding fathers
73:46 of this science i mean give me a break
73:49 that's what i love about electronics
73:53 electrical engineering you can't
73:57 lie about a lot of that stuff because i
73:59 mean you can misconstrue what an atom is
74:01 and all this other stuff
74:02 the fabric of the universe because you
74:04 simply can't
74:05 sense it you can't get anything down to
74:07 that level
74:09 but if i said to you build this circuit
74:11 a particular way
74:14 and then turn it on and it's going to do
74:15 this and you tried it at your house
74:18 well then you should get the exact same
74:19 result i'm getting
74:22 it's just math but where you get to this
74:25 blurry stuff
74:26 you know religion is the most blurry
74:28 thing on planet earth
74:29 but you get to archaeology and you know
74:32 a lot of these guys are probably trying
74:33 their best to be honest
74:35 but if they need funding for something
74:38 you know there was a
74:38 dark five episode that was all about
74:42 islands that no longer exist
74:46 and in every single case that i remember
74:49 it was
74:50 an explorer that wanted to go to a
74:53 particular part of the world and explore
74:55 and they would make up fake places
75:00 come back to their financiers and say
75:03 oh my god we found all these islands we
75:05 found this whole continent you know that
75:07 we didn't know existed and we're going
75:08 to name it after you
75:09 but i need the money to go up there and
75:11 stamp the ground with your name on it
75:14 and so they transcribe it on a map
75:16 places that don't exist
75:18 which is kind of weird because i want to
75:22 just pick one that it does exist but a
75:23 lot of them already had names you know
75:26 there's a huge paradox in egypt
75:29 i find it to be the most riveting
75:32 frontier
75:33 which is why i talk about it so much i
75:36 hope you guys aren't tired of listening
75:39 the one thing i would obviously love to
75:40 do is get my trip back to egypt
75:44 uh planned and get it to execute
75:47 but i'd also like to go along with
75:48 someone like the uncharted x guy or
75:51 graham hancock or someone with a like
75:53 mind
75:54 who brian forrester or something so that
75:57 i could get
75:58 one someone knows the culture really
76:00 really well which i studied the culture
76:02 quite a bit
76:03 because uh old story coming back
76:06 i had a travel agent putting together a
76:10 trip to egypt
76:12 in august of 2001
76:16 just about to buy tickets man and 9 11
76:19 happens
76:20 and i get a call from the agent going
76:22 you can't go over there right now
76:24 and then those german tourists were
76:26 murdered
76:27 i think in front of the cairo museum but
76:29 wherever they were they got blown away
76:31 and it was just you know but i study
76:33 denial i
76:34 study places where you can get off the
76:36 boat and other places where you're not
76:37 allowed to get off the boat or you can
76:39 but you're going to get whacked
76:41 that's why i got to have someone with me
76:43 that is going to know the locals and say
76:45 this dude's with me and all that kind of
76:46 stuff
76:49 i would love to see them in my lifetime
76:51 spend some time there
76:53 and try to find out maybe some answers
76:56 to these mysteries man
76:58 i don't even know what it would cost
77:00 nowadays
77:02 and the bummer about these trips is you
77:03 always got to pay your bills at home
77:05 no matter if you're gone or not pay off
77:07 your car got to pay for your house
77:08 all that kind of stuff you know an echo
77:12 of what we're saying in the modern time
77:16 and what's interesting is i told you
77:19 guys i'm watching the taxi show i just
77:21 watched like six or seven episodes last
77:22 night
77:24 and at least in two episodes the world
77:26 trade centers were in
77:28 one of the episodes and some hollywood
77:30 schmuck did not
77:31 go in there and erase them
77:35 i mean that's gotta be erasing those
77:38 buildings out of movies
77:39 and television shows should be something
77:42 that just smacks
77:44 the families in the face that lost their
77:46 loved ones to that
77:47 and it really damages the entire
77:49 historical culture
77:51 of our society if they get to all of the
77:53 shows and erase those
77:56 towers and then
78:00 get some draconian control over the
78:02 world they simply will tell you that
78:04 those things never existed those those
78:06 are just rumors they don't exist
78:09 what i find amazing about this
78:10 particular issue
78:13 is that the most brilliant minds haven't
78:15 talked about this
78:17 a graham hancock i mean i haven't seen
78:19 every single interviews ever put
78:20 together
78:21 and i have not read all of his books but
78:23 i think i'm only missing one egypt book
78:26 that he's written
78:28 but this should be the question of all
78:30 questions
78:32 for that particular area of the world
78:36 why is the past so
78:39 categorically hidden from the present
78:44 my producer being told and proved
78:47 all in like 10 minutes that he was
78:49 standing on a giant pyramid in
78:51 south america why wouldn't that be
78:54 excavated
78:56 at least in part you don't need to
78:57 uncover the whole thing
78:59 but at least you know take a strip from
79:02 the top to the bottom
79:03 and make it a hundred feet wide or
79:04 something and just strip all the
79:07 dirt away build maybe some temporary
79:09 structures to keep it all back from
79:11 filling in and allow people to climb
79:15 this other amazing structure one it's
79:17 indigenous to the people you would think
79:20 that they would want credit for having
79:21 developed this technology at least some
79:23 point in their history
79:25 it just keeps begging the notion is this
79:27 going to uncover a greater conspiracy
79:31 of where we are and what we are
79:34 for the consensus reality application
79:36 towards this whole thing
79:38 what i find most mysterious about that
79:41 idea
79:42 and it kind of negates the idea would be
79:45 how could we ever discover anything if
79:49 we had to con concede
79:52 or be in a consensus that it existed
79:54 before it could exist
79:57 right we could uh it's almost like but
80:00 we also know that
80:01 creativity is probably the
80:05 bedrock of this soul-based universe
80:08 right
80:09 we are creators we have a creature
80:13 that made us and therefore we have his
80:16 or her gene pool
80:18 uh soul pool whatever you want to call
80:20 it
80:21 so maybe as we attempt to discover
80:23 things
80:25 is where the imagination of either
80:27 drawing from the database of the
80:28 universe to say
80:30 out there somewhere in some other
80:32 physical world
80:34 whatever shape you like these things
80:36 were created
80:38 by the beings on that previous
80:40 civilization
80:42 so here we are board let's just say
80:47 and we start digging in the ground and
80:50 we are drawing on a subconscious
80:51 database of
80:53 things that could be found and so
80:56 whoever is the most powerful mind in
80:58 that region
80:59 or either the explorer themselves the
81:01 archaeologists the anthropologists
81:03 whatever they are
81:04 they tend to have a very informed mind
81:07 about everything we've found so far
81:09 and so a little frog dna from the
81:11 universe and boom we got a new discovery
81:15 it's interesting when you have a dream
81:17 and you get into sort of a similar kind
81:19 of discovery within a dream
81:22 you know if you woke up and you went to
81:24 a really amazing place in your dream and
81:26 you saw
81:27 things that didn't exist in your room
81:29 like i've seen i've been to the future
81:32 a handful of times in my dreams it's all
81:36 in my mind of course
81:37 i think but i've seen
81:41 beautiful uh structures in the middle of
81:43 like a
81:44 pretty shallow woods but very dense and
81:46 it was like a clearing
81:48 and there was a like a beautiful big
81:50 long strip of a pagoda
81:51 with crazy cool furniture that i'd never
81:54 seen before
81:55 and then when i got next to the house
81:57 that the pagoda was a part of
81:59 the ground had this kind of purple
82:03 aluminum looking it kind of had the
82:06 petroleum thing but not
82:08 too swimmy not too rainbowy but it was
82:11 like a
82:12 purple to to
82:15 aluminum to like deep purple trim but
82:17 you know when you see those um
82:21 the pictures of how
82:24 protons explode in a
82:28 particle accelerator and you see the big
82:30 spins
82:32 the this back patio which was all made
82:35 of steel up
82:36 against a normal building had cuts in
82:39 the steel
82:40 that were kind of like the path of an
82:42 electron not quite perfect wasn't
82:44 completely down to a fractal
82:46 thing but here comes a ship and it lands
82:49 and
82:50 its base had little protruding
82:54 dowels that would plug into these
82:56 openings and then
82:58 the floors started swimming and the ship
82:59 would just turn around and park itself i
83:01 mean this is the most amazing thing
83:03 i saw that again in a setting in a city
83:06 which was a nightclub
83:07 that had the same landing mechanism it
83:10 was very cool
83:11 very interesting right but that was just
83:13 all in my dream so
83:15 it proves that we can conceptualize
83:18 things that we've never seen before
83:20 and so maybe there's a part of it that
83:24 can bleed into this world
83:26 or maybe this entire world is nothing
83:28 more than a bunch of
83:30 people hardening the cement
83:34 of other people's creativity oh
83:38 what are you seeing i mean it was again
83:39 it was the whole thing of the uh the
83:41 shaman seeing the ship coming in from
83:43 europe
83:43 the normal people couldn't see it the
83:45 shaman could because he had a more open
83:46 mind he starts teaching them how to see
83:48 it and all of a sudden everyone that
83:49 came over
83:50 they could see him for a few miles
83:51 before they arrived at the coast
83:54 that being a more real-world application
83:56 of this overall theory
83:59 the proximity of the pyramids to
84:02 so much of the other discovered
84:06 architecture over there is where it
84:08 becomes
84:09 very difficult to reconcile
84:13 if the giza plateau was in an area and
84:16 you had to travel 500 miles or so
84:18 or even 200 miles before you found the
84:20 next building
84:23 the next statue the next something or
84:24 other that that was not
84:26 typical of the same architecture that is
84:29 the pyramid
84:30 then you could simply say well they just
84:32 didn't travel that far
84:34 they didn't need to so they didn't they
84:36 couldn't conceive of anything being over
84:38 that hill or
84:39 whatever and you could you could write
84:41 it off that way but the problem is it's
84:43 all
84:43 extremely dense people don't build
84:46 things
84:47 without a purpose they simply don't
84:51 even if it's simply art it has a purpose
84:56 the amount of duplicated statues over
84:58 there
84:59 had a purpose building
85:03 giant pillars
85:07 there's a purpose to it it does
85:10 uh for me um you see the parthenon
85:16 you see giant pillars building a
85:18 structure and there's a
85:19 nice roof over the top when i look at
85:22 the egyptian
85:23 temples and what have you you know a lot
85:26 of the roof part is all gone so it makes
85:27 me wonder
85:28 if that was ever to have a roof ever you
85:31 know and you need to get up there and
85:32 take a look at the stones because if
85:34 there were giant stones on top well one
85:36 look at egypt they when stones fall they
85:38 just leave them where they fell
85:40 you know so just an open-air structure
85:44 is probably what they were doing because
85:46 they knew how to encapsulate a building
85:48 there's plenty of buildings over there
85:49 that do that
85:50 their dwellings their temp their temples
85:53 and many cases
85:54 are are there but big palaces built for
85:57 people supposedly
86:00 it's just infinitely fascinating isn't
86:01 it but give me your
86:05 information if any of you really
86:07 remember dube's video
86:09 and maybe some points that might
86:11 catalyze this conversation even further
86:13 please share those
86:14 if you know where there's a link to that
86:15 video if someone pulled it down and put
86:17 it on their channel
86:18 please let me know i know a lot of you
86:20 actually do rip videos down
86:22 because you know they're going to
86:22 disappear when you like them so if you
86:25 still have a copy of that let me know
86:26 you can use like some sort of file
86:29 sharing service
86:30 to get that to me so i can see it
86:33 i would be much obliged and again if any
86:36 of you are
86:36 our typical journalism viewers and
86:39 you're up there this is an unsecure
86:41 if any of you ever find the video abuzz
86:44 aldrin
86:44 saying on live television once we figure
86:47 out how to go to the moon it'll be a lot
86:49 easier to get to mars
86:50 a bunch of you've seen that video can't
86:53 find it anywhere it is embedded inside a
86:55 journalism video
86:56 based on nasa stuff
87:00 he has so many i'm just gonna have to
87:02 figure out a way to watch them all to
87:03 get that video scraped for our video
