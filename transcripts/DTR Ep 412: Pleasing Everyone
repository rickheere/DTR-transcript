00:28 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts
00:31 I thought today's episode might be
00:36 valuable because it's something that
00:39 comes up a lot I think in our own
00:41 personal thoughts but we don't really
00:42 bring it up to other people so today's
00:45 episode is also dedicated to one of our
00:48 listeners her name is Val Miller she
00:53 made a really interesting comment she
00:57 wants the evolution to episode and
01:00 commented some subject to the effect of
01:03 yet another disaster episode I literally
01:07 called my friends and told them I got
01:09 this comment it and everybody laughed on
01:11 the other side it was hilarious and that
01:14 just brings up something that is the
01:16 episode title which is satisfying
01:18 everyone or satisfying the world and
01:22 because it's it's a tall order that I
01:28 don't think we should try to do so right
01:32 off the bat should you try to satisfy
01:35 the world my answer is gonna be a little
01:37 bit more firm than most folks absolutely
01:40 not
01:41 absolutely not the second you care about
01:44 what other people think is the second
01:46 that you cease to become who you should
01:48 become and you run off and become some
01:51 crazy bizarre person that you don't even
01:54 know who the person is what we're gonna
01:57 go through it because I want to make
02:00 sure you understand what I believe about
02:04 the subject matter see if we're on the
02:05 same page you may have a separate angle
02:07 that causes you to try and please the
02:11 world I've seen obviously my own life
02:15 and caring about the world were to talk
02:18 about the dopamine switch and the the
02:22 chemical programming that comes with
02:24 satisfying another person and how
02:26 instantly addictive that is we'll talk
02:30 about you know random people your lovers
02:34 your children and perhaps your relatives
02:38 but then I've seen those individuals all
02:41 those roles just living life as you have
02:44 to watching them try to satisfy the
02:47 world in the peaks and valleys that come
02:51 with that the time wasted and being
02:54 alive and trying to do that and then we
02:59 have celebrities celebrities are
03:01 hilarious with this because some of them
03:03 oh my god there's one foul comment about
03:06 them they are literally crying for days
03:08 and trying to adjust and apologize and
03:11 virtue signals of the crap and then
03:13 there's the most popular celebrities in
03:15 the world who could give a [ __ ] what you
03:17 think and that's why you like them
03:20 because it doesn't smell and taste and
03:23 sound like everything else like oh my
03:25 god this person's pandering to me again
03:28 social media has absolutely amplified
03:31 the psychosis of trying to satisfy the
03:36 world and it's it's taken it from a
03:39 celebrity level where what they used to
03:42 say was that a Jack Nicholson said it
03:44 perfectly in the Vivian Kubrick's making
03:47 of The Shining he said that a an average
03:51 big-time celebrity will meet in one year
03:53 the amount of people that you will meet
03:55 your entire lifetime but with social
03:58 media most citizens of the world who
04:01 obsess on that stuff will catch up with
04:03 a celebrity fairly quickly think of
04:06 every Instagram account you've ever seen
04:08 where it's a beautiful girl who works
04:11 out at a gym and it's just can I get a
04:15 bunch of slobbering guys to look up my
04:18 feet and then I'm gonna get some
04:19 sponsorship and some of them have
04:21 training courses some have beautiful
04:23 before-and-afters and some of the
04:25 wonderful people I think the legit
04:28 people that work out and you can make
04:30 your choice of whether you like that
04:31 kind of content the other half of it is
04:35 you know your CD or folks that are out
04:41 there texting you that have you come to
04:43 their special channel you can buy time
04:45 with them and watch them do things I
04:47 mean it's a little bit different tints
04:48 the social media has turned
04:51 people into people that they would never
04:53 be otherwise so let's talk about it
04:58 obviously the first perspective it's
05:00 probably the most detailed is any one of
05:02 us talking about our own personal
05:03 experience with sight of satisfying
05:05 other people why are we addicted to it
05:07 what has just happen well when were
05:10 little kids
05:12 you know it's it's a primal instinct to
05:14 satisfy your parents because they
05:16 control everything in your life and I'm
05:19 not saying be a bad person or be a bad
05:21 kid by no means you can be yourself and
05:25 not be a jerk you can be yourself and
05:27 obey the rules you can get clever like
05:31 Captain Kirk and you can escape between
05:34 the rules you know one of the big things
05:36 I had raising my child is that a lot of
05:42 my friends would come in and tell me
05:44 stories about how their kid would get
05:45 clever and get around rules and some of
05:49 them would get very few but and they
05:51 were acidic enough that I was like to
05:53 him what's your issue man but I found a
05:55 way to get them to relax a little bit
05:57 but one of them was that you know some
05:59 parents get completely terrified or they
06:01 get terrified that the kid's gonna keep
06:03 going down this road and breaking rules
06:05 and becoming a become a huge problem end
06:07 up in prison more of that has to do with
06:10 the culture around your child you know
06:12 they surrounded by people that are
06:13 constantly try to put guns in their
06:14 hands or tell them they're not men if
06:16 they don't kill somebody and you got to
06:18 move that's what you got to do who cares
06:21 if you go from one bad place to another
06:23 bad place just keep going until you
06:24 don't have the influencer prepend your
06:26 children but the idea is I I thought
06:31 when I saw started seeing my kid get
06:32 clever does she always wiggle between
06:34 the rules most the time I thought oh my
06:38 god this kid's gonna do really well in
06:40 life because she's clever she's smart
06:43 she's witty she knows how not to break
06:45 the rules but she knows how to get what
06:47 she wants
06:48 you know desire will make your brain
06:51 think of all kinds of things right how
06:52 can I get that thing I did I can't
06:54 really have you know I could not buy
06:56 that thing I don't really have money for
06:57 and so I just started saying well that's
07:01 healthy growth
07:03 my kids showing healthy signs of a
07:05 healthy mind and it's being it's being
07:08 beyond trivial it is being clever clever
07:11 it's just a great thing a clever
07:15 Velociraptor is a very interesting thing
07:17 right I mean it clever animals and you
07:19 know it's like we have videos all the
07:21 time of cats and dogs and raccoons and
07:23 all these things like the possum that
07:25 walks on my fence over there getting
07:27 clever and we love it when were kids we
07:31 are susceptible to chemical reactions
07:32 and our brains that we don't really
07:34 understand what we don't understand it
07:35 at all this you have a prodigy child and
07:37 you're teaching them this this content
07:40 but dopamine is a huge powerful force in
07:43 the brain it's why everyone gets
07:44 addicted to anything you get addicted to
07:46 watching a TV show gambling you know
07:50 having sex whatever it's the dopamine
07:52 drop in your brain that will literally
07:55 control you and that's why quitting
07:59 addiction of any kind is so rough on the
08:03 system because you literally your body
08:06 pouts it feels it transmits in place of
08:10 that algorithm of dopamine dropping it
08:13 transmits pain trying to cause you to go
08:16 get more dopamine which is why you got
08:20 to be high in live folks now will say I
08:24 have one strategic benefit maybe I have
08:27 two strategic benefits of becoming who I
08:29 was in life and it only occurred to me
08:31 in the last few years which is when I
08:34 was an only child didn't mean I didn't
08:36 have relatives and tons of friends
08:37 around me but I went home to a house
08:40 with just me in there and my parents the
08:44 second benefit was that my parents were
08:45 swept away by the 70s and the the
08:49 reengineering of society to introduce a
08:52 level of narcissism to depopulate and
08:55 they bid it hook line and sinker I want
08:58 to ask my mom once why I didn't have any
09:00 brothers or sisters she said well we
09:02 couldn't afford them seriously
09:05 seriously oh and all those other
09:07 neighborhood kids are living in palaces
09:10 somewhere nah the whole algorithm for my
09:13 parents was me me me me me and
09:16 so that left they left me alone I was by
09:20 myself doing my own thing all the time
09:22 that turned out to be a huge benefit
09:25 because in place of emulating somebody
09:27 else I was just myself I had to listen
09:31 to my own thoughts I've got a good
09:34 friend of mine I mentioned and once
09:35 before
09:36 not by name but he lives here with me in
09:41 California here and he he loves hiking
09:43 and so one of the things he drives
09:46 really long distances to get to these
09:48 really cool places and he'll just all by
09:51 himself he just hikes around and he told
09:54 me or three or four years ago he said
09:56 you know it's really pissing me off as I
09:58 go out there to hike and I see people
10:00 wearing headsets listening to you know
10:03 really loud music which one interrupts
10:05 his experience but two he goes the they
10:07 can't
10:08 it's his impression and I think he's
10:12 probably correct at least and to some
10:14 double-digit percentage degree he said
10:18 they can't afford to listen to their own
10:20 brain here they are the most beautiful
10:23 landscapes of Southern California and
10:26 they can't just sit and listen to the
10:28 nature he goes you know how these people
10:30 get eaten by mountain lions he goes they
10:31 can't hear I'm coming so it's like kind
10:34 of going to a concert and then putting
10:36 headset in listening to a different band
10:38 while you're watching the one on stage
10:40 they take in where you are or don't go
10:43 why go anywhere if you're just gonna
10:44 blank it out with you know some other
10:48 soundtrack to your life right now of
10:51 course if you lived you know there's
10:52 exceptions if you live next to a canyon
10:54 and you've seen it a million times and
10:55 you have done that walk fifty times a
10:57 hundred times or more
10:59 it's a jogging path for you it's you
11:01 know it's not so brilliant to you right
11:05 but I think you had a point and because
11:10 we are now in this short attention span
11:12 theater where it's get on social media
11:15 do you know really social medias like 95
11:17 percent of everyone's life and the other
11:19 5% is trying to create [ __ ] pictures
11:21 to prove to the world how great your
11:23 life is so then again you satisfy other
11:25 people but the other thing about my life
11:29 and I
11:30 again I didn't realize this for a very
11:31 long time was it I always gravitated to
11:36 well I guess I'd be two species first I
11:39 think you know like as far as
11:41 entertainers in my life the band Kiss
11:43 when I was a kid I just loved the fact
11:45 that they were totally different put
11:47 makeup on and the music was amazing and
11:50 just the world loved them and they were
11:52 never jerks they never beat their wives
11:53 or killed anybody you know most of
11:55 rappers these days have got to have that
11:57 in their record otherwise they're not
11:59 cool but everyone was cool and then
12:02 believe it or not I that I've mentioned
12:07 this several times but you know I bumped
12:09 into Prince performing on Saturday Night
12:11 Live
12:12 it was the famous episode one of the
12:14 actors said the f-bomb on stage and got
12:16 fired the next day and then very short
12:19 after that I actually slightly before
12:21 that I guess I found Adam Ant and so I
12:24 ended up gravitating towards these
12:26 entertainers that were sort of
12:28 Singleton's Prince especially right that
12:31 a man had a whole band that helped him
12:32 do his thing but of course there's just
12:33 that centerpiece character you're coming
12:35 to see that dude and you know Prince was
12:39 a little more you know funky and deep
12:41 with his groups whereas Adam Ant was
12:43 creating you know pirate punk music
12:45 which no one in the world will ever
12:47 replicate but what that what that kind
12:50 of taught me was that you can build your
12:52 own persona it's not really important
12:54 with what they do i watch out a man in
12:56 the video goody two-shoes and I almost
12:58 want to turn inside out again that guy I
13:02 think regrets having to perform that
13:04 song as much as he does I watched him do
13:06 it in San Francisco alive and I just
13:07 watched him cringe onstage going do I
13:09 really have to do this song and he tried
13:12 to you know do a Trent Reznor version of
13:15 it but it's still goody two-shoes good
13:20 for him for making all the money from
13:22 that song at least but it was always
13:25 this study of the self you know how am I
13:28 going to entertain myself am I gonna do
13:30 this and in the 70s and 80s especially
13:33 in the 70s the whole game was to go to
13:35 your house figure out your stick figure
13:39 out how you look figure out how you do
13:41 your hair figure out what kind of
13:43 clothing you are
13:44 of course I couldn't really take
13:45 advantage of a lot of that but when I
13:47 was a kid I moved to new neighborhoods
13:49 constantly and so if whatever reason I
13:54 was just a really chill kid and so I
13:59 didn't you know really attract bad stuff
14:03 around me the bad kids wanted to be my
14:04 friends just as much as the good kids
14:06 and you know you kind of changed just a
14:09 little bit for each one of the groups
14:10 but I would typically very quickly
14:14 become the leader of the group and you
14:18 know we used to raise hell do all kinds
14:19 of stuff as a little kids but the funny
14:22 thing is is you know I was really I was
14:25 with the guy today at the smoke lounge
14:27 and he said something pretty profound
14:29 which we all kind of know and it sort of
14:31 dovetails into my playground wisdom
14:33 episode which I'm very proud of they
14:36 said you know school for kids is a
14:39 microcosm of how the world works youth
14:42 your authority figures over you and the
14:44 chaos down at your level and you got to
14:45 deal with all the emotions of so one guy
14:47 wants to beat you up over there some
14:49 chick wants to kiss you over there and
14:50 blah blah body it's just really the
14:52 ecosystem of the world on a micro level
14:54 and I thought about I said man you're
14:57 totally right
14:57 and so it's important when you think
15:01 about why if you're really into like
15:03 pleasing the planet or you're not and
15:06 you're super strong and you're kind of
15:07 inquisitive of like how the hell did I
15:08 get here to the point where I never gave
15:10 a crap about anyone what anyone thought
15:12 you have to look at your childhood you
15:14 have to figure out the circles of life
15:16 how many brothers and sisters you have
15:18 now I know friends that have eight
15:19 brothers and sisters and they are the
15:22 most individual kind of people on planet
15:23 Earth because they would let their
15:27 siblings go out and entertain the family
15:29 while they chilled out in the room and
15:31 they got all the same stuff I got but
15:36 what ended up happening for me is that
15:37 getting moved around a lot was actually
15:38 very healthy because boy you know you
15:41 got to get your your constitution down I
15:43 mean if someone's moving you from one
15:45 sweet little town to another sweet
15:46 little town you won't know anything
15:48 about what I'm talking about
15:50 but if you get moved around to some
15:55 they're pretty neighborhoods that are
15:56 rough and yet rough neighborhoods that
15:59 are rough I mean I meet I got a bunch of
16:01 buddies who have really grown up in some
16:03 tough tough neighborhoods and they're 50
16:05 times you know more individual
16:10 individual individualistic my god I'd
16:13 say about 10 times than I am
16:15 and so I look up to their sort of
16:19 carefree nature but the reason why we
16:20 all kind of gravitate to each other is
16:22 that we just kind of wear our own man as
16:24 they say and of course there's the
16:27 female version of that as well but by
16:29 the time I got to high school my god I
16:31 was my own dude I dressed my own way you
16:35 know anybody came with me to like the
16:38 runs that you do when you live in a
16:39 little tiny town a hundred miles from
16:41 any big city is that you drive for two
16:43 hours to the big city you go to your
16:45 whatever the place gave you shoes in
16:47 that place your pants on that place that
16:48 leather jacket from that your glasses
16:50 there you're looking at everything all
16:52 over the place you watch TV a little
16:54 differently because you're trying to
16:55 figure out what everyone's doing and the
16:57 coolest places on earth and then you try
16:59 to figure out how your hair goes on your
17:00 head and try to figure out how it's
17:02 gonna work for you and you experiment at
17:04 home you develop skills you don't just
17:07 develop skills that are aimed at a
17:10 career you develop social skills because
17:12 you have to you have to stick out by
17:14 being moved around a lot you want to
17:17 meet people quick to kind of like
17:18 rebuild your world as quickly as
17:20 possible so say you live in one town and
17:23 you're you're indigenous to that that's
17:24 where you're born or raised for the most
17:26 part a man you went to kindergarten
17:28 first grade second grade third grade but
17:30 if you get moved then you're back to
17:32 zero and how long is it gonna take for
17:34 you to replace all those friends from a
17:36 previous location well you're gonna need
17:39 to be interesting charismatic a good guy
17:44 and I'm gonna be getting making any
17:45 friends you know crapping on people and
17:47 taking advantage of people and so I
17:49 would work hard to ramp that up as quick
17:51 as possible and it worked you know when
17:56 you grow up it's not necessarily moving
17:58 from town to town it's going from job to
18:01 job and so you're trying to get ramped
18:03 up your allies and figure out you know
18:06 where the company is at a particular
18:07 point how you can
18:08 but whatever it is right but the whole
18:12 thing about satisfying people is sort of
18:16 an out-of-body experience that you start
18:18 having and I think it's extremely
18:21 unhealthy so how many times have you
18:24 heard the phrase you know be true to
18:25 yourself you know what does that mean
18:28 that's that could mean a lot of things
18:29 what is truth truth is this giant
18:31 concept it can have anything in it that
18:33 you could possibly put in it I think
18:37 being true to yourself as being one
18:40 inquisitive enough about who you are as
18:43 a person to figure out what makes you
18:44 tick
18:44 what turns you want what's the theme of
18:46 what turns you want to help people do
18:49 you help yourself what is it based on
18:52 whatever that theme is you got to live
18:54 for that theme until you have a
18:56 different idea about what your theme
18:57 might be you might start off one way and
18:59 end up another you know now what's
19:02 interesting I'm going to pause for one
19:04 second on this chronological crawl here
19:06 and go back to this show
19:08 so I've heard it you know before I made
19:12 my own radio show with Kyle and in this
19:14 show you know I watch people say watch
19:18 people respond who had channels to
19:20 negative comments and you know you kind
19:22 of cringe for them because you don't
19:24 want anyone to have any you know
19:26 griefers in their life and then you know
19:30 you're like I wonder how I would respond
19:31 to that whole thing and you know luckily
19:34 most the stuff I put out is pretty well
19:36 received and it's almost there's two
19:39 things to it you know yes it doesn't
19:42 hurt my feelings when someone says I
19:44 love the show or I love the injure or
19:46 whatever it is it doesn't feel bad feels
19:49 good then when something negative
19:51 negative comes through there's all kinds
19:55 of different levels of that if someone
19:59 really articulates why they think
20:00 something is bad you can have almost a
20:05 an enlightenment moment if you can see
20:08 what they're saying right when people
20:10 said you know could you I love your show
20:12 but I listen to it I have to listen to
20:14 it around my children could you please
20:16 not swear so much I was like yeah I need
20:19 to stop swearing so much you know so I
20:21 put an effort in
20:22 because I agreed with their perspective
20:24 and it would be a shame to to take the
20:27 show away from someone because I can't
20:29 control my mouth now I'll throw a couple
20:31 and you're in there I've already done it
20:32 in this episode but I try to keep that
20:33 down to a bare minimum now but the funny
20:37 comments that you know like there's
20:39 there's the one that Val made just today
20:44 and there's the ones that came in on the
20:46 my first moon mission episodes the moon
20:48 hoax episodes and the one that's easy to
20:52 kind of minimize is someone coming in
20:54 and just either being factually
20:57 completely wrong or you could see
21:00 they're super deep in that that denial
21:03 phase of the information right we've got
21:05 first-hand proof we've got you know I've
21:07 got people that told me things and
21:09 people say they don't exist you know
21:11 whatever you know I was there you
21:13 weren't and it happens to connect with
21:15 everything else the officials have said
21:17 who defected out of these groups so in
21:19 some cases you just wipe your hands boom
21:21 that's just never really affects you you
21:23 feel sorry for them up to a point right
21:27 then there's the comments like vows
21:29 which is like I'm gonna take a crap on
21:32 your on your show here but I don't have
21:34 the I guess wherewithal or you know I
21:41 I've seen a lot of great comments from
21:43 this person so it's weird for me that
21:45 she didn't describe why she thought it
21:47 was a disaster and the reason why my
21:51 friends and I laughed so hard on the
21:52 phone with this comment was that we
21:55 started making jokes about what would a
21:57 disaster episode really be you know it's
21:59 like going to a restaurant a couple
22:00 things go wrong or one thing goes wrong
22:02 and you go on Yelp and you give them one
22:04 star you know it's like really what's a
22:06 one-star experience at a restaurant you
22:08 know you know you puke your guts out
22:10 when you come home because you got food
22:11 poisoning there that's one star somebody
22:13 let you on fire that's one star you know
22:15 but a disaster episode it sounds like a
22:18 one star to me and I'm sitting there
22:20 going how could this be so bad that
22:23 disaster is the phrase right so you know
22:26 people can have bad days and they just
22:28 vent it on a comment but it's just it's
22:32 interesting when you get that
22:36 where you're being disapproved of where
22:39 you are normally not disapproved of and
22:41 I'm not talking about the show anymore
22:43 but it's just in life now sometimes you
22:49 know you're brick breaking the rules
22:50 you're bending the rules and like when
22:53 you're a kid and when you break the
22:55 rules and you get you don't get cut and
22:57 so you do it again and you don't get cut
22:58 and then the third time you get caught
23:00 and now you have already braced for
23:03 impact you might you might talk back to
23:07 your parents and you know have you deny
23:11 that you did it even though you know you
23:13 did you're just doing your in a feral
23:15 state of survival right and so when that
23:17 happens inside you're not trying to
23:21 satisfy the world you're just trying to
23:23 stay out of trouble you know the that
23:28 you know a few of you are friends with
23:29 me on on Facebook and the only feed that
23:34 I post at all is the deep mind episode
23:36 which you can join me from the locked
23:40 Facebook group I'll prove everybody
23:43 who's a real person no problem and you
23:46 will see the only feed that I have on
23:49 Facebook which are some of the really
23:52 rare Cuban cigars that I smoked with my
23:54 buddy Dave that's it that's the only if
23:58 you get I have two other accounts once
24:00 an old one one's a new one nothing on
24:02 them there's like my profile stuff got
24:04 some photos in there but that's it
24:06 there's nothing in there and so the
24:11 thing is is I used to post like crazy I
24:13 used to post a bunch of controversial
24:15 stuff and then I got the the in kilcher
24:18 radio show and I realized oh my god I
24:20 can take all my negativity and put it in
24:22 the MK ULTRA Facebook page which still
24:24 exists by the way and then I realized
24:27 okay I was getting so involved with the
24:29 negativity that was just running my life
24:33 you know it's just like not horribly but
24:36 it was just like I don't want those
24:36 epiphanies of or those moments where I'm
24:39 I'm feeling bad who the hell wants that
24:42 and so I just stopped I just stopped and
24:46 then I discovered Instagram
24:47 maybe because of my daughter
24:50 and other than a few females that
24:53 constantly post their latest Amway
24:56 products on their 24/7 which I
24:58 immediately unfriend the cool thing
25:00 about Instagram was that people were
25:02 posting about their lives I was a bit of
25:05 an improvement that stuff still happens
25:06 on Facebook but you don't get to run
25:09 your mouth a lot I mean you can but I
25:10 don't think anyone really reads it you
25:12 put a big giant paragraphs in there my
25:13 life was so much better than yours today
25:15 Facebook it's all about that I'm I've
25:18 traveled overseas I've done this and
25:22 there's an innocent part of sharing that
25:25 process which is you're having such an
25:27 exciting time you want to share it but
25:30 deep down inside I believe a thousand
25:33 percent
25:34 it's wow I can't wait to have everybody
25:37 envy me for doing this and I've been
25:41 guilty in the past as well of posting
25:44 something you know it's even me being
25:46 stupid and posting things where I'm in
25:48 really special places with special
25:49 people I usually try not to post that
25:52 stuff because I don't think those other
25:53 people want me to do that there's been
25:55 some scenarios where it's totally cool
25:58 man post that up it's great but then
26:01 when I thought about how it might make
26:02 people feel it's like yeah so I was
26:06 doing the opposite I was either trying
26:09 to post to satisfy someone that is going
26:13 to be amazed well that guy from high
26:15 school and you know where he went he did
26:16 this that and this and then the other
26:18 side was not posting it to make sure
26:21 they don't have a bad feeling
26:22 I'm pleasing the world I'm not doing
26:25 what I want to do in the end all I want
26:31 to do is have backups of my photos
26:33 that's really where it's at on my
26:34 Instagram it's all about just taking
26:38 great photographs that's all I want to
26:40 do I love photography
26:42 and I grew up with the professional
26:44 photographer as a father and so you know
26:47 I love film and I've always been an
26:49 artist you know sketch paint digital so
26:53 composition is a real big deal to me
26:55 color is a really big deal to me I never
26:57 I almost I think I have a single
27:00 photograph on my Instagram that I
27:01 haven't filtered down with one of my
27:03 special
27:03 filters where I jack the colors in a way
27:06 I love them
27:06 I want the photographs to feel out of
27:09 this world just to take you some other
27:12 place but first and foremost these items
27:17 satisfy me and if you happen to like it
27:20 then great if you don't like it I don't
27:23 care you know I'll tell you a funny one
27:27 in the last 10 years or so I've had my
27:29 hair long my god people I mean like I
27:33 don't look like crap right so I really
27:35 do check myself out from different
27:37 angles make sure I'm not losing my hair
27:38 or something to the point room you know
27:40 I'm a bald guy with the ponytail yeah
27:43 you know some people look great like
27:45 that I don't know I don't know I've been
27:48 very fortunate with my hair but people
27:51 will come up to me and say oh you would
27:53 look so good with short hair I'm like
27:56 well that's your opinion man this makes
27:58 me feel me you know I never had long
28:02 hair as a kid I don't know why I never
28:04 did it I did it I'd hit long hair one
28:07 time sort of a Patrick Swayze thing back
28:09 when he was doing his thing I didn't
28:12 like that guys I mean I I think he's a
28:14 great person before he died of course
28:16 but I didn't fall I got it I had a
28:18 girlfriend that loved dirty dancing I
28:20 didn't watch way more times than I ever
28:21 want to admit but I was an 80s rocker
28:24 kid you know I loved all those eighties
28:26 bands like but I never grew my hair how
28:28 it's weird so what I did it was like
28:31 this kind of spiritual experience where
28:33 I thought man you know this is me and
28:35 I'm sorry that so many friends that I
28:37 know probably 50% of the people I know
28:40 are like he looks so much better I love
28:43 your hair up and edited it out I'm just
28:45 kind of like well that's good
28:46 cuz I'm gonna keep my hair up when I'm
28:50 working when I'm inside you know when I
28:51 got to bend down work on something it's
28:53 like you know keep my hair back up but I
28:55 don't do it for anybody I do it for me
28:57 and I think it's interesting I mean it's
29:02 probably some people that might sway me
29:03 if they can convince me that I would
29:05 like it more than we're on we can go
29:08 change things right but today we have
29:11 this other virus which is virtue
29:13 signaling which I cannot
29:15 stand I want to use a dirty word so bad
29:18 right now whoever asked me not to swear
29:20 that was that moment was for you but
29:24 this whole thing of I'm going to show
29:25 the world how virtuous I am and I was
29:30 gonna make it episode fully dedicated
29:32 this but I think you guys would be
29:33 asleep in 15 minutes so I'm just gonna
29:34 embed it inside this episode which is
29:36 this this I think it's nauseating habit
29:43 of making everyone else's problems in
29:46 the world your problems and yet and it's
29:48 not to really give a crap about the
29:51 problems I mean they probably do it to
29:52 some extent but it's like my God if
29:55 there's anything bad going on in the
29:57 world they're on Facebook in two seconds
29:58 I really care about this and I'm gonna
30:01 show you how much I care about it more
30:03 than you do you know and if you try to
30:05 care about it more than me I'm gonna
30:06 double care about it you know it's just
30:08 it's just awful I don't even know what
30:13 words we have for it but it's you know
30:16 spare me you're saving the universe
30:18 theme of life because I don't buy it for
30:21 one and two you can't do anything for
30:23 the entire world work on your little
30:26 circle your little hemisphere you little
30:29 sphere of influence [ __ ] you know me a
30:31 good at shining example for society you
30:34 know do something in your local world
30:37 don't worry about a murder in Chicago a
30:39 shooting in El Paso don't worry about
30:42 any that stuff we're about you know I
30:46 have someone I admire and this person is
30:52 an animal activist in her personal
30:55 travels which I totally respect she has
30:58 tons of animals that she helps and I saw
31:01 a post it was like it was like a
31:04 secondhand post that she screen captured
31:07 that someone made about her then virtues
31:12 signaling inside the post about how much
31:14 they liked her because she was caring
31:17 about the animals that are going to get
31:19 threatened by this Dorian hurricane
31:23 that's happening it might hit the coast
31:25 of Florida it's night it's over the
31:27 Bahamas as of the
31:28 recording right now but I'm sitting
31:31 there they can my god you you screen
31:34 captured someone blow and smoke up your
31:36 whole about you being virtuous and you
31:39 scream captured it and you post it on
31:41 your Instagram to show the world how
31:43 great you are it's like wow what are you
31:46 president Trump someone so said I was
31:49 great today you know well if you guys
31:52 can hear that screaming possum in the
31:54 background so what are the advantages of
31:57 you throwing down the gauntlet and
31:59 saying look I have been a victim of this
32:02 because I think we all have I mean we
32:04 all have I just think you would have to
32:06 be a really special child not to care
32:07 about what other people think
32:08 from the very very beginning and I do
32:10 know some kids in my past that have been
32:12 that way but what do you get once you
32:15 throw that away I think you get an
32:18 unbelievable rebirth you get freedom
32:23 it's liberating beyond liberation for
32:27 you to go you know what in order for me
32:30 to stop caring about the rest of the
32:32 world
32:32 I gotta start caring about myself hmm I
32:36 once had a uh I once got tested on this
32:40 on this theory say hey I'm preaching hey
32:43 don't care about what anyone else thinks
32:44 but I violated this the same sanctuary
32:51 of personal expression once and I
32:54 corrected for it but I was dating a girl
32:59 who I would come to pick her up to go
33:03 hang out we did it for several years and
33:06 she would be dressed in the weirdest
33:09 stuff I'd ever seen anyone put on
33:12 expensive stuff granted but like bizarre
33:17 clothing and we and it would be like
33:21 heavier clothing than the weather was
33:24 outside so it was like why are you all
33:25 bundled up man it's like hot outside why
33:27 are you doing that for
33:28 that so it was just strange-looking part
33:31 of me I guess just had I had a
33:33 preference that was different than hers
33:34 and so part of me was like look we live
33:38 in California there's a lot of great you
33:40 know
33:41 options here there's a lot of beautiful
33:42 people here I don't really want to go
33:45 out what the chick is dressed in the
33:47 clown outfit you know some bizarre weird
33:50 thing I'm telling you I think you would
33:53 agree it was at least extremely
33:54 different it took several years and of
33:58 getting past that moment and you know I
34:01 it's like I hate even saying it but I
34:03 was kind of like coaching her on people
34:05 that she admired and saying look you
34:07 really like that those chicks right and
34:09 you're like yeah okay well then look at
34:11 what they dress in I mean do you buy her
34:12 that or you just admire who they are as
34:14 a person no I like the way they dress it
34:16 was like okay I think they look really
34:18 great on you and we complete your whole
34:20 desire to be more like them because you
34:23 admired them not for any stupid reason
34:26 but because you really dig how they put
34:28 themselves together and she eventually
34:30 found her own way in doing that but in
34:35 the end I probably put out the flame a
34:37 little bit for her her own
34:39 self-expression and I'm not proud of
34:42 that and I kind of carry that with me in
34:46 present day experiences to make sure
34:48 that if I see someone kind of you know
34:51 going to the beat of their own drum
34:52 I'm like yeah that's kind of cool a man
34:55 in Southern California what's awesome is
34:57 this gets tested 24/7 be driving in your
35:00 car down in Los Angeles and some other
35:02 big city or even you know Huntington
35:05 Beach or whatever and there'll be some
35:06 kid who's all tricked out in the most
35:10 bizarre clothing right and it sometimes
35:14 it's like the people put them to selfs
35:16 they put themselves together really
35:18 really well and the second you see them
35:19 you're like oh my god that's cool I'm
35:22 Way too old to dress like that but if I
35:24 was your age I'd be right there next to
35:26 you coming up with my own version of
35:28 that which was really what the 70s and
35:30 the 80s were like you know I've said it
35:33 a hundred times on different shows but
35:34 when you followed people in the 80s it
35:39 was I'm gonna copy you and that means I
35:44 got to do my own thing
35:46 Prince said it a couple times interviews
35:48 he goes if my fans follow me if they
35:50 worship me they don't burn their hair
35:53 and
35:54 and try to look like me they find their
36:00 own thing and when they come in we have
36:02 a style that jives but their hair is
36:05 totally different than mine their
36:06 clothing is totally different than mine
36:07 and they're learning about
36:09 self-expression
36:10 they're digging deep inside of who they
36:12 are what colors do you like what I know
36:14 what shapes do you like that's what kind
36:16 of clothes you're gonna buy how you comb
36:17 your hair is a shape that you like you
36:19 know and you're gonna have some winners
36:22 and you're gonna have some loser so
36:23 you're gonna try things I'll give you
36:27 some examples when I was in junior high
36:28 I used to go get my hair cut in a tiny
36:31 little town eventually when I got back
36:34 to my own town and the barber would
36:38 literally say you know I gotta call your
36:42 dad to make sure it's okay that I do
36:45 this to your hair and he made the call
36:46 one time he caught one time my dad was
36:49 on this side of when he goes he goes oh
36:51 you can do anything you want like this
36:54 this is my kid and he's really weird so
36:57 just do anything he wants you know so I
36:58 mean I would get like one side of my
37:00 head shaved and the other pulled out I
37:02 you know I did the stupid dumb what at
37:05 the time was totally cool but the whole
37:07 rat tail thing they hung out of the back
37:10 I mean I was doing all kinds of crazy
37:12 didn't color in my hair all this other
37:13 crazy stuff and you know just hey you
37:17 know if I wanted stripes inside the side
37:20 of my head that's what I did and it was
37:22 cool as my parents again they they were
37:25 very familiar with prioritizing
37:27 themselves so when I needed to
37:28 prioritize myself they were just like
37:30 I'm not taking you anywhere you're not
37:33 gonna embarrass me I don't go to the you
37:35 know the royal ball and each time soon
37:37 so yeah just go ahead and do it my mom
37:40 when I would go shopping for clothes you
37:42 know every mom tries to help their kid
37:43 find clothing because you need help when
37:45 you're young by the time I hit my teens
37:47 she just was like she'd just stand out
37:49 stayin in the front of the store and
37:51 she'd watched the help try to help me
37:54 and she'd just start laughing and
37:58 eventually they give up and they go over
38:00 to talk to her and she'd say you just
38:02 got to stand back he's just gonna find
38:04 what he wants and that's it and he's
38:05 really fast at doing the two so it's
38:07 only a
38:07 take about 10 15 minutes and he'll be
38:09 done and that's the truth so the benefit
38:13 you get by wiping away this stupid worry
38:16 about what other people think is you get
38:19 to be yourself and if you never have
38:21 been yourself and there's people out
38:23 there that will hear my voice that won't
38:25 admit it but that's what that's the case
38:26 okay so it's a little slow every once in
38:29 a while I had stupid haircuts I had
38:31 stupid clothing really stupid clothing
38:34 and you know I'm glad there's no
38:37 photographs they too to record those
38:40 moments on the Internet
38:41 I mean I oh my god I've got photographs
38:45 in my house that are sort of important
38:48 to keep but my god that way I was
38:50 dressed oh she's just the worst but then
38:54 I went through it and I was like yeah I
38:55 did that and that because it was the 90s
38:59 but now the other part of it is I'm
39:01 talking about sort of the lighter end of
39:05 being yourself your outer appearance
39:07 right the bigger most more impactful
39:12 example of this is who you are as a
39:15 person you know what do you care about
39:18 what do you not care about how do you
39:21 form your words you know how are you
39:23 form your sentences with your words how
39:25 do you build communication between two
39:27 people
39:27 how much do you sit around you know
39:30 moaning about other people's problems it
39:33 doesn't mean you don't care and doesn't
39:35 mean you don't say a prayer at night for
39:37 people's lives to be better doesn't
39:40 negate any of that it's just I'll tell
39:44 you something happens I'm gonna cut
39:46 myself short there one thing I noticed
39:49 is growing up in a really small town was
39:52 that the older guys were really crass
39:54 with what they said and a lot of times
39:57 pretty funny and you know I didn't grow
40:02 up any I mean I grew up in a pretty
40:03 colorblind town you know we had you know
40:06 like I've told you several times the
40:07 black families in my town were in some
40:10 cases royalty the Mexicans were royalty
40:13 I mean they owned the restaurants and
40:15 they were our school teachers and
40:17 their kids were fantastic I mean you
40:20 know like all I'm talking about every
40:22 race in our town like they're some of
40:23 the kids would be all-stars you know and
40:26 just the nicest kids on planet earth one
40:28 of my childhood idols in high school
40:32 it's getting Randy Martinez so it's just
40:34 an amazing guy and so we now or because
40:38 of this whole I'm accusing everyone of
40:40 being a racist thing this whole virtue
40:43 of signaling democrat horseshit that's
40:45 going on everybody is on extra let me
40:47 extra prove to you I'm not racist an
40:49 extra proof that kind of stuff but I
40:52 grew up on Richard Pryor man and Richard
40:54 Pryor was keeping us all in check by
40:58 making sure that he wrote jokes about
41:00 everyone's perspective of everyone else
41:03 and so in the end he said everything
41:06 that we were thinking and he made it not
41:09 hurt and that was amazing so that when
41:12 we got together with his energy in the
41:14 world you know you could tell when I was
41:19 a kid I mean it was like you could tell
41:20 a racial joke in a room with that race
41:23 and they would tell a joke back the
41:24 other way
41:25 so Dustin's your race sometimes it's
41:27 their race and vice versa and we were
41:29 all kind of like we were way more
41:30 together and bonded because in the end
41:35 I'm not saying bringing this this
41:37 necessarily this particular habit back
41:39 but I just want to give an example of
41:41 people living truthfully and not
41:45 worrying about what if someone else
41:46 thought because we're all grown-ups that
41:49 was the other thing right but imagine
41:52 you sat with a friend in well let's do
41:56 today 2019 I've got plenty of friends of
41:59 every race you could possibly imagine
42:01 and let's say i sat there with them and
42:02 I don't tell jokes much and I certainly
42:04 don't tell racial jokes but let's say I
42:07 was that kind of guy you couldn't even
42:10 conceive of oh well put this way it's
42:13 hard to conceive of having a
42:15 conversation about racial differences
42:17 today because you don't want to fit any
42:19 other person because they have been
42:20 taught by this Democratic Party
42:23 globalist [ __ ] group of people that
42:25 as soon as you offend someone oh my god
42:28 it's it's how much can I give you to say
42:31 sorry you know here's my house you know
42:33 deed and here's my car keys and here's
42:35 my wife I hope I hope that's enough you
42:38 know but back in the 70s it was awesome
42:42 you could sit in a room with everybody
42:45 from all these different walks of life
42:46 and you could tell a joke and I was
42:48 always a little kid watching this
42:49 happens on you know I'm not trying to
42:51 put myself in the middle of actually
42:53 being able to do this personally but if
42:57 I saw the jokes car and again they
42:59 didn't hurt nobody was trying to be mean
43:02 you know everything was kind of funny
43:03 and it was so stupid the stupid white
43:06 jokes the super black jokes super
43:08 Chinese jokes or whatever it was it
43:10 would go into the room everybody would
43:13 laugh and here's the thing because we
43:16 could all laugh at each other and
43:18 ourselves the amount of forever life
43:21 bonding that these people had and still
43:24 have to this day is infinite you know if
43:28 anybody in the room needed anything from
43:31 anyone else everybody was there you know
43:34 if your car didn't work well I got that
43:35 other car why don't you just drive that
43:37 until we all work on your car and get it
43:38 fixed boom we're all community we all
43:42 work together and there was a time to
43:46 tell jokes and there was a time not to
43:47 tell jokes and it was beautiful everyone
43:51 was being themselves we didn't have
43:54 social media if you wanted to be at the
43:57 party you had to go to the party and
44:00 how'd he get invited to the party
44:01 mm-hm you couldn't be a fake person
44:06 because who wants that person around you
44:09 couldn't talk about yourself all the
44:11 time so we learned social etiquette with
44:15 each other and there wasn't a credit
44:17 system you know penalizing us if we
44:19 didn't we would kind of foe Paul and
44:22 Hazel look at you kind of funny like
44:23 really you just said that yeah that was
44:25 dumb wasn't yeah that was that was
44:27 pretty bad it's okay you get a pass you
44:30 know we know what you meant
44:31 now relax be yourself if you really
44:36 thought you had a problem with us we'd
44:37 sit you down and talk it out of you but
44:39 you're just trying to be funny we've all
44:42 had that person room that is trying to
44:44 be the funniest person
44:45 room I've definitely been guilty of this
44:47 with my closest friends and what you
44:51 find out is that you talk too much and
44:53 you're trying to tell a joke every time
44:55 something occurs to you and in the end
44:58 you'll say a couple dudes these everyone
45:00 smile that no one will be able to erase
45:02 and especially you won't be able to
45:03 erase it and you'll find out that the
45:06 moment you do that you are being genuine
45:08 to who you are you should have just sat
45:10 there and just enjoyed the silence with
45:13 everyone else while you're watching a
45:14 movie or watching TV you're doing
45:16 whatever the hell's going on don't try
45:18 to fill up the blank space all the time
45:20 but the other one is this little
45:23 scenario that happens every once in a
45:24 while where it usually ends with the
45:27 phrase it's something like this I didn't
45:30 know that's what you really thought you
45:33 were doing this why did you say that if
45:35 this is what you really thought and the
45:37 other person says well I thought that's
45:38 what you wanted to hear that's not what
45:41 I wanted to hear I won't hear what you
45:43 think and when you raise kids this
45:45 happens to you and this coveted it
45:47 happens all the time when you raise your
45:49 kids your kids you're trying to please
45:50 you and they'll you know you sometimes
45:53 you can see right through it and your
45:54 you can warm up to them and say yeah you
45:56 know I know you don't want to do that
45:58 that's fine you know what to do that
45:59 it's cool but thanks for thinking about
46:02 me or thinking about the family or
46:04 whatever it is I appreciate that and
46:07 they're like oh my god I could be myself
46:09 yeah but sometimes well the key point
46:13 that happened to me with my kid was this
46:14 what he gonna be when you grow up sort
46:16 of thing High School's coming to an end
46:18 and you got to figure out what you want
46:20 to be in life and there you know some
46:23 kids are really good they can really
46:25 bond with their parents during those
46:26 experiences will help me out you know
46:28 I'm thinking about this and thinking
46:29 about that but I haven't met that kid so
46:33 if that's a if that's something I maybe
46:36 I was that kid because I was like dad I
46:38 need a computer he's like okay so I want
46:41 a computer from RadioShack
46:42 I'm gonna buy it off him for 50 bucks
46:44 I'm gonna give it to you and you do what
46:46 you do I don't really have any interest
46:48 in that see do your own thing and that
46:50 worked for me it was cool my kid really
46:52 stressed she really stressed about my
46:54 opinion of her job and she
46:58 in there it started innocently where she
47:00 was telling me about one of the
47:05 low-hanging fruit things you can do in
47:06 California has become a nurse nurses are
47:09 great nurses are wonderful I love them
47:11 especially when I need them and they're
47:12 amazing at what they do but we know what
47:14 happens to nurses in this world that you
47:16 vaccinated to death not only my kid
47:18 vaccinated for any reason whatsoever and
47:21 so I told her I said you know we'll just
47:23 be careful about that you know they have
47:25 to take like dozens of vaccinations a
47:27 year every year you're gonna have your
47:29 rotted brain by the time you get to my
47:30 age and I don't think you want to make a
47:32 forever decision like that before you
47:34 understand the implications of what
47:36 those things aren't now you don't
47:37 believe me you know my conspiracies
47:39 about that stuff having worked in pharma
47:40 I still have to earn that whole thing
47:43 and so she stressed is the next thing I
47:47 bring to my dad the thing that he's
47:49 gonna crap on in her brain it was that's
47:51 what I was doing I was saying you're
47:52 making a bad decision that's not what I
47:54 was saying at all I really wish they
47:56 leave these nurses alone let them pick
47:58 what they want to be vaccinated by not
48:00 to not make it an imperative to keep
48:01 their job I still think that's
48:03 ridiculous I had a friend of mine I have
48:06 a friend of mine who aced radiology
48:09 school and he became a radiologist and
48:12 when it came down that he just gonna
48:13 have to take some ungodly amount of
48:16 vaccinations he resigned out of active
48:20 duty as a ready radiologist and he went
48:23 into the IT department of radiology
48:24 which has no customer facing element
48:26 thus came off his requirement to take
48:29 vasc vaccinations and I mean what a
48:32 sacrifice he made to protect his health
48:35 I mean I gets an A+ for the life that he
48:40 lives you know so you can have these
48:43 tight relationships with your kids where
48:46 they really they want to do right by you
48:49 and they may even really respect your
48:52 opinion but they also have their own
48:54 interests and their own lusts for things
48:56 and so they get kind of worried you know
48:59 again I've said this several times on
49:01 different shows but there used to be
49:03 this thing in the eighties when kids
49:04 would tell their parents they want to
49:06 become actors or comedians or singers
49:10 the parents just immediately roll their
49:12 eyes because like those aren't real
49:13 careers you know you got to have a
49:14 fallback thing that you do and
49:16 ironically enough tons of the people
49:20 that are considered famous today from my
49:23 generation not from the current
49:24 generation I don't know anything about
49:25 the current generation but a lot of them
49:27 have degrees you know in full fallback
49:31 careers every one of the Pythons had
49:32 fallback careers and one of them was a
49:34 doctor but didn't David Bowie have like
49:37 a degree in accounting or something and
49:40 I mean like all these guys had something
49:42 they went through formally and then they
49:43 simply fell into their career so they
49:47 didn't have that rub they satisfied the
49:49 fallback plan that perhaps their parents
49:51 imposed on them and then they finally
49:53 fell into what they loved all right do
49:57 what you got to do man you can still be
50:00 yourself and create a fallback career no
50:02 problem with that whatsoever Graham
50:05 Chapman was the guy's name for Monty
50:06 Python you know with the Great Awakening
50:09 we have plenty of subjects that people
50:12 get ridiculed for and people still hold
50:16 their own you know if I'm not a flat
50:19 earther I have to say that because if I
50:21 don't I get a bunch of hate mail I
50:25 respect flat earthers for multiple
50:28 reasons that I've mentioned several
50:31 times on the show but one of the biggest
50:32 reasons is their being true to
50:33 themselves you think it's easy walking
50:36 around telling people you think a round
50:38 ball is flat it takes some balls man and
50:42 they're holding their own and you know
50:44 again NASA's no help in figuring out
50:47 what it is but I have to say reading
50:49 about the the N ROC foundations that are
50:55 using satellites to control the world if
50:57 you don't believe satellites exist you
50:59 may be being set up for a major sucker
51:02 play and you know like Skynet finally
51:04 launches you like well those things
51:06 don't exist
51:06 oh yeah [ __ ] boom you're dead
51:09 I'm glad you didn't believe in that up
51:11 to that moment I don't think people
51:14 launch rockets just to see them go up in
51:16 the air I honestly don't we do they
51:19 don't but the great waking tests
51:23 everybody for the
51:24 of your huge queue enthusiasts and you
51:26 think the plans gonna happen it's rough
51:28 right you have had your Constitution
51:31 tested and the only thing you can do is
51:33 really run back online and find people
51:35 exactly like you or filter out your
51:37 friends that don't believe what you
51:38 believe and only stick with those people
51:41 but it's a very real thing when it comes
51:43 to being who you are if you're extremely
51:46 religious it happens all the time right
51:48 you stick with your religious friends
51:51 now the caution for everybody not just
51:55 religious people is that you know we
51:58 talk about becoming a well-rounded
52:00 person
52:01 and part of that is always a comment
52:05 that accompanies education you really
52:09 want to learn as much as you possibly
52:10 can about how the world works from how
52:13 it works technically to how it works
52:15 sociologically you have your own
52:17 personal laboratory which is your own
52:18 mind and so that's your psychological
52:21 playground and so you do want to stay
52:25 well I'll put this way if you want to
52:27 truly become who you are then you know
52:32 part of it would be I give you I give
52:34 you weird analogy say you grew up in the
52:38 Midwest
52:38 and you're still there today or in some
52:40 rural area wherever you live in the
52:42 world and you're rural area does not
52:45 have exotic food of any kind you barely
52:48 have ever seen sushi and you've barely
52:50 ever eaten let's say Indian food but you
52:54 know you're like you know your friends
52:58 dragged you to that restaurant you go on
53:00 a vacation and everyone else is eating
53:02 it or it's the only thing that's being
53:04 served and you're kind of freaked out
53:06 not because you like man I don't know
53:07 what I like I don't like raw this and
53:09 raw that the the the reality is is if
53:12 you like fish at all so I told my kid
53:16 when she was sort of hesitant to eat
53:17 sushi because she'd always get like the
53:19 teriyaki chicken or whatever now she's
53:21 addicted to sushi and I warned her when
53:23 she was a kid I said I think it's great
53:25 you don't like sushi because I don't
53:28 want to pay for your meal eating sushi
53:30 because it's always super duper
53:32 expensive you know and I was joking out
53:33 of course and now she loves it and now
53:35 she's got to find places she can afford
53:37 as a
53:38 as a teacher you know to eat that kind
53:40 of stuff Indian food same thing we have
53:43 the two famous dishes in America that we
53:45 eat of Indian food and I think at least
53:47 one of them exclusively was a kind of a
53:49 British American creation meaning it was
53:51 created in Britain and we live we love
53:53 it which is tandoori chicken anybody who
53:56 doesn't like or doesn't know anything
53:58 about any of who could always eat
53:59 tandoori chicken because it's just
54:01 chicken is seasoned there's no sauce on
54:03 it and of the new Bazaar it's not super
54:05 hot or anything like that but the other
54:07 one is chicken tikka masala which has a
54:09 thick sauce it's chicken but that sauce
54:13 can be made you know
54:14 2 million Scoville hot I mean they can
54:17 make that stuff so hot it'll burn your
54:18 brains out so it's a little bit of a
54:20 riskier dish you have to tell them you
54:22 know don't make it too hot I don't like
54:23 hot food if you like hot food brace
54:25 yourself
54:26 you better be hot pepper fan right now
54:29 how cool would it be let's say you eat
54:31 some sushi and you dig it and you eat
54:33 some Indian food and you like it ok good
54:36 this is a metaphor for Education and how
54:39 the world works how cool would it be to
54:43 sit down with a master sushi chef or a
54:46 master Indian food cuisine chef and you
54:49 say I want to try your food I want to
54:52 find more than just these couple dishes
54:53 of these couple pieces of sushi that I
54:55 like but I don't want to eat something's
54:57 gonna make me throw up you know know I
54:59 have a texture thing or whatever your
55:01 deal is that only super salty things or
55:03 whatever it is and the chef sits with
55:05 you and goes ok well tell me all the
55:07 other food in the world that you like
55:09 hamburgers hot dogs steaks baked
55:12 potatoes do you like butter do you like
55:14 salty like sugar and they ask you the
55:17 interview with all these different
55:18 questions and they're like you know what
55:21 I know exactly what you would like on my
55:23 menu and they go fetch little samples of
55:27 it and they give you a spoon or whatever
55:29 it takes to eat it and you eat it you
55:31 know this should be like eating a steak
55:34 and you're like pow oh my god you're
55:35 right you're in a sushi world they're
55:38 like well do you like shrimp yeah you're
55:40 any shrimp sushi no oh my god no let me
55:42 go get it for you this shrimp is
55:44 actually cooked poof
55:47 there's one more dish that when you go
55:49 out to a sushi restaurant you don't have
55:50 to look like a neophyte you didn't
55:52 California rolls every time you sit down
55:54 right the reason why the body likes
55:57 sushi is that raw food is out we ate
55:59 food for a really long time before we
56:03 learned how to put it on a fire so
56:05 there's this natural ability to complete
56:07 diggit fish eggs and that kind of stuff
56:10 you know maybe it's not your game I
56:13 remember first time a dude I was 18
56:16 years old just new to California my boss
56:18 loves sushi I was terrified of it man
56:20 utterly terrified and he said he said
56:24 get me cucumber rolls you know it's
56:25 cucumbers wrapped in rice and seaweed
56:27 like that tastes good and gave me some
56:30 salmon oh yeah that's pretty good but he
56:33 said if you ever had a quail egg and I
56:35 said oh my god no oh my god you know a
56:37 plenty of like normal eggs and the idea
56:40 of you seeing Rocky Balboa drink a whole
56:42 glass of raw eggs just gag me so I
56:44 thought this is gonna be horrible and he
56:47 goes here
56:47 I forgot how they did it it was like a
56:50 shot of sake or something which I also
56:53 hadn't had but I wasn't afraid of sake
56:55 he goes I'm gonna put this they could
56:57 put the quail egg on top of this little
56:58 sake thing and you're gonna drink it
57:00 it's gonna go in your mouth he said just
57:02 do this he just pushed the coil like
57:03 which is teeny tiny man push it on the
57:05 roof of your mouth and pop it and the
57:07 whole thing is just gagging me just
57:09 thinking about it you know back when I
57:10 was 18 so I'm like okay I probably had a
57:14 little bit of sake to soften the blow
57:16 put it in there popped on the roof of my
57:18 mouth it was the most silky amazing
57:20 thing almost no taste whatsoever but was
57:23 the texture that was just out of this
57:25 world and so now I'm like oh my god I
57:28 can equal eggs and it gave me personal
57:31 power moving forward with sushi and I
57:36 will say that the thing that broke me
57:38 was I moved to the Bay Area because they
57:39 hadn't eaten sushi much in the Southern
57:41 California region I moved to the Bay
57:42 Area for 12 years my buddies said let's
57:44 go eat some sushi I'm like I don't like
57:45 sushi so come on come on they make you
57:47 like California wasn't my I guess
57:48 whatever and it was a master sushi chef
57:51 who actually lived half of his life in
57:54 America and Burlingame and half of it in
57:57 this place still exists it's called
58:00 skies
58:00 she is a ke sushi it's right off
58:05 Burlingame Avenue if you guys live up
58:07 there most amazing sushi ever but he
58:10 spends at least he did spend 20 years
58:13 ago six months of his life roughly in
58:16 Japan teaching the art of creating sushi
58:20 and he bring his star students over to
58:23 cook at his restaurant you know I cook
58:25 but you know it's a simple sushi no it's
58:27 just brilliant watch these guys do it
58:29 and so that guy knew I was hesitant and
58:35 started just upgrading one dish after
58:38 another afternoon I was like oh my god
58:40 now I'm totally addicted to this stuff
58:41 and it was expensive as hell right I
58:44 give you that little story so that you
58:46 do branch out a little bit as you're
58:48 trying to define who you are let me give
58:52 you the the what is it the devil's
58:57 advocate version of this - this isn't
59:02 necessarily bad because you own your own
59:04 life and screw everybody else but their
59:10 I'll just put this way social media got
59:13 on facebook I think 2009 cuz a friend of
59:16 my old boss of mine says hey man come
59:17 come get me on Facebook I was like okay
59:19 I hadn't seen him a long time so I did
59:21 it and there you go took me years to
59:25 delete all my posts after I decided to
59:27 get rid of him all I got on there and of
59:30 course it took my class of 87 forever to
59:33 figure out the internet 88 it was on the
59:35 internet in two seconds I don't know
59:37 what the hell the difference was between
59:38 the two years but between the one year
59:40 it just made all the difference in the
59:42 world but my class took forever to get
59:43 online so as people would come online
59:45 you know uploading the uploading a
59:48 profile pic was a pretty monumental
59:51 technical tasks for them when they first
59:53 got on there and some of the people
59:57 would upload a photograph and it looked
60:00 like they had uploaded a photograph from
60:02 high school and at first you thinking
60:04 well they probably don't have a lot of
60:05 photographs scanned in the computer
60:06 they're not you know they don't have
60:08 digital whatever they you know they
60:10 don't have selfies or whatever you know
60:11 they're living in Kansas so whatever
60:13 be back 10 20 years-plus and then I
60:17 discovered one of the most profound 80s
60:21 photographs that I had ever seen online
60:24 was a current day picture we're talking
60:28 about a haircut they went out of style
60:31 probably 1989 clothing like acid wash
60:35 clothing still being worn as if it was
60:38 right off the shelf now it's kind of
60:40 coming back right it's kind of funny you
60:41 stick to it and eventually in three
60:44 decades your look will come back but I
60:47 remember looking at this photograph
60:48 going oh my god this person has been
60:51 literally in a bubble for 30 years 20
60:54 years at least right like 20 years yeah
60:56 and so it kind of saddened me because I
61:01 was thinking oh my god this person
61:02 really never went anywhere in their
61:04 brain and forget about having to travel
61:07 everywhere you don't need to go anywhere
61:08 if you don't want to but because I'm
61:10 such a you know hey man you're full of
61:13 all kinds of potential kind of guy and
61:14 I've never been wrong about that once
61:16 you start working with people they go to
61:18 the once you believe in them and and if
61:21 you're lucky enough to observe them and
61:23 then prove to them that they have all
61:25 these major skills then they start to
61:29 feel it it just becomes a vibe and they
61:31 break out of their shell and they go do
61:32 amazing things so I had you know that
61:36 was a weird interesting social
61:38 experiment to see everybody come online
61:41 and then eventually that hair changed
61:44 and things changed so they started
61:45 seeing the rest of the world and maybe
61:49 it was a tiny bit of pleasing other
61:51 people to kind of branch out a little
61:53 bit one of the funny arcs that happens
61:56 and it happens to all of us in real life
61:57 but it happens in movies all the time
61:59 how many movies have you seen where they
62:01 take a really beautiful woman or girl to
62:05 Benny what kind of movie you're watching
62:06 and they dress her down they put the
62:10 stupidest haircut on her they just did
62:11 this on I was watching glow believe it
62:14 or not but they keep someone looking
62:16 horrid the whole show and eventually
62:19 third act comes around and they do a
62:22 makeover and then pop that person that
62:25 we studio knows is utterly gorgeous
62:27 that's
62:27 they were hired to do the part pops out
62:29 where's the prom dress whatever puts on
62:32 the the night gown or whatever and the
62:35 the scene just explodes and everyone's
62:38 like oh my god I knew she was pretty and
62:40 etter that's cool and so you get that
62:43 amazing gratification by reinventing
62:46 yourself so the the sort of catch-22
62:50 with this algorithm is is that if you
62:53 are pretty successful in reinventing
62:55 yourself and I got a whole episode on
62:57 that if you're interested go to deep
62:58 thoughts video com click the search
62:59 field just type the word reinvent you'll
63:02 get the episode is that you will most
63:05 likely get a lot of positive reaction at
63:08 least from some people another example
63:12 that as I'm riffing the cigar to death
63:16 in the 90s I really got into music and
63:19 started just creating instrumental
63:21 albums as I was figuring out how to
63:23 write music and I would you know pass
63:25 cassettes around up friends and
63:27 definitely send them out to my family
63:28 members and I was immature really
63:30 looking for praise from this this effort
63:33 and what ended up occurring was that you
63:40 know you know relatives and stuff
63:41 they'll say it's nice just because and
63:43 who knows if they really liked it or not
63:44 but the the interesting thing was with
63:48 friends they're a little bit more honest
63:50 and brutal which is great and I worked
63:52 really hard on the music so it's not
63:53 crap necessarily but I would make an
63:56 album of at least 10 songs and there's
64:00 10 songs and so they don't have to like
64:02 all of them but what ended up occurring
64:05 is that I found out that the reviews
64:08 would come back and someone would say
64:11 they loved a song and they would say
64:15 they played it a hundred times in their
64:16 car but they would never complimented
64:18 the other tunes and so I asked a couple
64:20 of my closest friends you know what do
64:22 you think about the other ones oh they
64:23 were okay and then the funny thing was I
64:26 talked to a different friend one of them
64:28 was one of the most profound experiences
64:31 I had was that I gave it to my first
64:33 boss in the Bay Area gave the latest
64:36 album I made and I give it to him and he
64:38 took it home
64:40 and then came back to work and this is
64:43 my boss so it's kind of like I want him
64:45 to like me he had just gotten the job
64:47 the same day I got the jobs here both
64:48 first-timers into the company so we
64:50 didn't have any kind of you know weird
64:52 on my more senior than you kind of thing
64:54 he was my boss and I respected him for
64:56 that but he said because he waited the
65:01 whole day didn't say anything at all
65:02 into the whole day and I wasn't gonna I
65:03 wasn't thinking about it but he stops me
65:07 right before he left for the day and he
65:09 goes you know I just want to tell you
65:10 about that album yes as I put that thing
65:12 on and he had a brand new wife and he
65:17 put it on and he said we made love to
65:20 that album all night long and he goes we
65:24 just kept kept it looping the whole time
65:26 who's the longer albums when I was
65:27 pretty busy but he says there's that one
65:29 tune you know that one too and Ike was
65:31 called like some stupid name like alien
65:34 arrival or some weird thing like that
65:36 but it was this you know synthy tune I
65:38 made and he goes that was the wani was
65:40 that just that's just sent us over the
65:43 whatever over the cliff of whatever the
65:46 hell it was right and I'm ever thinking
65:48 about that going geez what that told me
65:51 was that there's always an audience as
65:54 long as you put your heart in it right
65:55 I'm not making music in a studio
65:57 thinking about my boss that I'm not I'm
65:59 not gonna have for three or four years
66:00 having hot sex with his wife I'm not
66:02 thinking about that I'm making music
66:03 that I like to hear and I if I don't
66:06 like it it doesn't go on the album it
66:08 just becomes a trashy little track off
66:09 to the side but the ones I dug I
66:11 polished them up as much as I kill it as
66:13 a memory I had on my keyboard and get
66:15 him out the door so know that as you
66:17 reinvent yourself if you have been
66:20 victim to this whole please the world
66:22 thing you're gonna have fans that you
66:24 never had before and you're gonna have
66:26 people that have grown accustomed to
66:28 this weird persona that you have that
66:32 are gonna not like the new person
66:34 necessarily but then when you get used
66:35 to you after a while and while we're
66:38 talking about persona you let me mention
66:41 on the episode a lot the kind of
66:43 Freudian Russian doll theory of how the
66:46 brain works the outer most shell as your
66:50 persona is who you pretend to be in
66:52 front of people that you don't know
66:54 and then you have your character
66:55 underneath that and that is who you
66:57 really are and then you have your ego in
67:00 the dead center which is essentially
67:03 your subconscious child who's always
67:04 weird and fearful and bizarre and
67:06 chaotic right I don't think that's
67:09 what's really going on necessarily but I
67:11 do believe in a character in a persona
67:13 for sure we all feel it the easiest way
67:16 for me to define a persona activity as
67:18 if you are empathetic towards older
67:22 people let's say people over 70 or even
67:25 over 80 they're more you know relaxed in
67:28 their life the perhaps they're more
67:30 sweet and simple because they don't have
67:32 any battles to fight anymore and you
67:35 know you mean an old woman in her 80s or
67:36 90s you immediately go into that lovable
67:39 version of yourself because that's sort
67:42 of the sort of the persona of the room
67:45 you know they're that way naturally
67:46 you're not that way because you grew up
67:49 in this world with terrorism and all
67:50 this other crap and so you end up being
67:53 kind of softer and you definitely watch
67:56 your language and you don't talk about
67:58 the things that are interesting to you
67:59 talk about the things that are
68:00 interesting to them and if they ask you
68:02 about your life you go into it but it's
68:05 all very guarded and then there's your
68:08 character or when you go home then
68:11 there's no one else around you're in
68:12 your car and there's no one else in the
68:14 car with you you are who you are now
68:19 there's probably a mezzanine a middle
68:24 line between your persona and your
68:27 character that is who you probably
68:29 really want to be you want to be nicer
68:34 you want to swear less it's definitely
68:36 the case for me and so you kind of ebb
68:39 your whole life to this zone and
68:42 probably the only thing that happens is
68:45 in your later years is you might just go
68:47 okay okay wherever I am right now
68:49 between my character and my persona
68:51 that's who I am I got no more time to
68:53 architect Who I am as a human being I'm
68:55 just trying to stay breathing every day
68:57 try not to fall down and break my hip
68:58 right and age is also an extremely
69:01 humbling experience I'm in an episode by
69:05 getting older and it's
69:08 you are interested in that subject
69:09 matter you might go look up that episode
69:11 as well but as you choose this sort of
69:16 beacon in your mind about how far you
69:19 want to go in any one direction you
69:20 didn't if you try to be who you are you
69:23 find out who that is you know one of the
69:27 things I mentioned in several times on
69:29 shows is that you know guys will
69:32 typically be single for large stretches
69:35 of their life it's just the way it is
69:37 but women in America at least are
69:40 trained whether or not they do this or
69:42 not and I'm gonna give some compliments
69:44 out to the ladies so don't worry if I
69:45 sound like I'm criticizing women for a
69:47 second but they are taught in this world
69:49 in this country of America the second
69:52 you start dating as a child other
69:54 children hopefully you're never to be
69:58 single ever again you are to date all
70:02 the way up to marriage and get married
70:04 pretty much as quick as possible you
70:06 used to be at least and then you're too
70:08 if you get divorced boy you're supposed
70:09 to be dating immediately and then get
70:11 married as quickly because quick as you
70:13 can because if you don't get married if
70:15 you're not with someone else and this is
70:17 the psychosis that's behind most of the
70:20 posts on the internet with women that I
70:23 see and some men do it too but they know
70:25 they're kind of being a little fruity
70:27 when they get into this algorithm but
70:28 it's to say look at me look how loved I
70:31 am I am not broken and the sad thing
70:35 about that whole journey is that they
70:39 have no clue who they are and any man
70:41 that can they can't find six months to
70:46 two years of singlehood they also don't
70:48 know who they are most the time most the
70:50 time they have no clue they might think
70:52 they know I don't mean to be cynical
70:54 about people who do know because if you
70:56 know you know but usually it's all about
70:59 pleasing the other person that's how you
71:01 can stay in a relationship constantly
71:03 you know if less you're super lucky and
71:06 you find you're your soulmate as they
71:09 say which is a word we usually associate
71:11 with a man everything's working out I
71:13 get to be myself and they're themselves
71:15 and we just click amen
71:17 you're the luckiest person on planet
71:19 Earth and I salute you
71:21 percent but I know a number of the
71:24 females that watch this show they've
71:26 contacted me over the years here in
71:28 there and they're not looking for a
71:31 relationship and I looking to sweet-talk
71:33 me or anything like that
71:34 and what's interesting about almost
71:36 every woman that I talked to who has
71:39 been a part of this show as a listener
71:41 and participating in all the social
71:42 media and comments and guiding episodes
71:45 is that they they do have giant moments
71:49 where they prefer to be by themselves
71:53 the end of relationship like you know
71:56 what and what I need right now is some
71:57 me time and they are just the most
72:03 strong well-adjusted people and it's
72:07 it's funny because the catch-22 is they
72:10 become so attractive to people like me
72:12 who are just like man you know if I ask
72:16 you you know if my life would be
72:20 interesting to you whatever answer you
72:22 come up with to the degree I inform you
72:23 about my life honestly I can trust your
72:27 answer because you know who the hell you
72:29 are and guys we got to make sure we know
72:31 who we are
72:32 it doesn't mean you know we're who you
72:35 were yesterday
72:36 maybe you don't like it you were maybe
72:37 maybe it felt good but it didn't feel
72:39 genuine and I think that's a huge
72:43 guiding principle of what we're talking
72:45 about here you know the word genuine and
72:50 sometimes it's very difficult to put
72:52 into words what is genuine what makes
72:54 you feel genuine but you don't have to
72:57 put it into words you just know when
72:59 you're being genuine to yourself and it
73:02 feels good man it feels empowering
73:05 because you are taking care of number
73:09 one if you are a person who's
73:12 susceptible to helping people because
73:13 that's your theme in life then you sort
73:16 of have an enemy inside you as much as
73:19 it is a virtue as sort of an enemy as
73:21 well when I first moved to California I
73:24 I guess I should mention names just in
73:29 case this person doesn't want this
73:30 revealed about them although it's an
73:32 endearing quality my boss
73:35 at the time he was known for well I to
73:41 some of his associates you know I was 17
73:44 just barely 18 at the time when I
73:46 started working for him and they said
73:48 you know his biggest downfall is that he
73:51 can't say no to anyone and at first I
73:55 thought that was just a business thing
73:57 and eventually I learned that he was
73:58 just a super nice guy and they said he
74:01 gets overwhelmed he says yes to everyone
74:03 out there who wants to engage in his
74:05 business and he can't possibly fulfill
74:07 all those yeses and so it was tearing
74:10 the company apart and he's still in
74:13 business and he still does exactly what
74:15 he did when I moved here 32 years ago as
74:19 far as I know still named after him
74:21 anyway and so if you are a person that
74:25 is super empathetic and you do find
74:28 yourself learning over everyone else's
74:30 losses in the world if that's your
74:33 problem
74:34 in not being who you are and not taking
74:37 care of number one you know it's like I
74:41 almost want to say this is sort of a
74:42 weird narcissistic sounding thing to say
74:45 but it's not I give you permission to
74:48 just care about yourself sometimes
74:51 that's all the words you need to hear
74:52 you can just take care of yourself now
74:55 if you have kids and stuff I'm not
74:56 talking about ignoring your children but
74:57 it's also very important that mommy or
75:01 daddy is satisfied and who they are as a
75:03 person because it will bleed through to
75:05 everything you do with everyone else in
75:06 your life especially your lovers and to
75:11 the degree you can communicate these
75:12 things in words to your family it's it's
75:15 huge
75:16 you know I did an episode on Parenthood
75:19 back in season one and it again it's
75:22 funny it has very low views you can
75:24 watch the remastered one on the deep
75:26 thoughts radio com
75:28 but some of the comments I got in
75:30 personal communications I got from these
75:33 people from people who watched it
75:35 several fathers the King to me and said
75:37 you know what I had not been
75:39 communicating with my kids about where I
75:40 was in the world and what was bothering
75:42 me and I realized I could and one guy I
75:47 believe he had a couple daughters
75:49 and he said I set my daughter's down and
75:51 I just simply told them where I am in
75:53 life and then I'm gonna need a little
75:54 bit of dad time I'm gonna be in the
75:55 house you know he'd get me when you need
75:57 me you know your protector and all that
75:59 good stuff but if I'm in my room and I'm
76:02 in my office or whatever working on
76:03 something don't take it personal I'm
76:06 just in Lightning myself with some new
76:09 knowledge that's gonna help me get a
76:10 better job and we're gonna have more fun
76:12 if I have a better job because I'll be
76:13 happier I may have more money and that
76:15 kind of thing he said I did it and my
76:17 kids completely got it and all that
76:21 tension left the family all that
76:22 subliminal anger feeling like the kids
76:26 were like is it my fault and dad is not
76:28 happy and that it all went away
76:29 automatically right so if you are
76:34 finding yourself you know neck deep in
76:37 this algorithm McMahon yeah I got a I
76:39 got a do something about this you know
76:41 and there's nothing I can do to
76:42 necessarily help you personally but
76:44 you're gonna re engineer yourself you're
76:46 gonna make your decisions based on what
76:49 you love in this world and you know what
76:50 again you're gonna experiment sometimes
76:52 sometimes you don't know and you're
76:53 gonna try that yeah well I thought I
76:55 liked that I guess I don't
76:56 you may even come right back to where
76:58 you were and say you know what who I was
77:00 is exactly who I want to be but now I
77:01 know it now when I do this thing that I
77:05 thought was my persona I understand it's
77:06 actually more of my character it's more
77:09 genuine to me and that's super
77:11 empowering man I'll tell you one little
77:14 trick that some of you will be able to
77:16 take advantage of for and there's
77:20 several of you out there because you
77:21 talked to me on the side some of you are
77:24 writers Dennis this is for you your
77:29 writers and you are you know all of us
77:33 are stuck in some form of constraint in
77:36 life you know like I can't just pick up
77:38 and go anywhere in the whole planet that
77:39 I want to go I can't just do everything
77:41 I want to do so I you know I'm pining
77:43 for certain careers and certain things
77:45 but one thing you can do if you have
77:47 this deep yearning for something that is
77:50 certain is somewhat unaccessible or
77:52 maybe a hundred percent on excess
77:53 inaccessible is to write fiction write a
77:58 story about that other person and here's
78:01 the cool thing
78:02 one you get to archetype your whole or
78:06 architect I should say architect an
78:09 archetype I like that this fantasy world
78:13 that you think might be something you
78:14 would be interested in and then
78:15 eventually you'll find out that's what I
78:19 want to do and you can become that
78:22 character character being the key word
78:25 really become more like that fictional
78:28 person you created so Prince always said
78:30 he goes I acted the way I wanted my life
78:31 to be and it happened he projected he
78:34 attracted Law of Attraction but if you
78:38 find out that's not someone you'd ever
78:40 want to be you even finish the book or
78:42 the screenplay or whatever and you're
78:43 like man I'm so glad I'm not that person
78:45 you know I'd say I'll tell you a little
78:50 story that you know transformed me with
78:53 the screenplay I was working on I saw
78:56 the the movie the professional
78:58 it's called Leone and Europe amazing
79:02 story about the hit man I mentioned it
79:03 several times on the show most of you
79:04 have probably already seen it and I
79:06 loved the genuine sort of gritty nature
79:09 of that of that screenplay so I thought
79:11 you know but I also saw you know all
79:14 these mission Impossibles the Bourne
79:16 Identity all these other things and the
79:18 Tom Cruise and movies that are sort of
79:20 like that for their individual badasses
79:24 or whatever usually fighting for good
79:26 and so I had created this sort of hitman
79:30 superhero not not KP super hero like a
79:34 very real person and I had this scenario
79:38 for him and I was like oh my god I'm
79:40 gonna write all these really cool scenes
79:42 that were gonna be these you know bad at
79:45 you know good a conquering evil kind of
79:47 scenes but still you know it was younger
79:51 when I did this by 20 years ago I was
79:52 really pushing this together but
79:55 eventually after I went for the script
79:58 and I really tried to develop the
79:59 character what I figured out was that
80:01 world was so utterly dark no matter how
80:05 much I tried to spend it positive it it
80:09 disgusted me after a while and I dropped
80:13 it I was like I don't want to bring that
80:14 reality into this
80:16 even if I could make a billion dollars
80:17 off of it I don't want to be known for
80:19 creating that kind of influence on
80:22 people to worship anybody who would do
80:25 such a thing whether it be good or bad
80:27 it was interesting and it changed who I
80:32 was it made me appreciate the fact I
80:34 don't live in those world you know we
80:36 talk a lot about you know the people
80:38 that control the planet and usually at
80:41 some point in your research about that
80:44 upper tier of people that have all the
80:45 mansions and all the plains and they get
80:48 to do anything that they want and all
80:49 the horrible things that they do even
80:53 the ones that don't do horrible things
80:54 you might see them in Morocco or Monaco
80:59 and and you know wherever some Paris or
81:02 whatever famous place you think you
81:03 would love to be driving cars you think
81:05 you want to have and living in these and
81:07 then rent a whole floor of a hotel or
81:09 whatever and you think you want to be
81:10 those people but in the end when you
81:13 really study it you're like man I would
81:14 never want to put people into those
81:16 people you always got a target on your
81:17 back you're always just your narcissism
81:20 you're neurotic about your losing power
81:23 and money and it's just a horrible
81:24 horrible life to live I would take a
81:28 porch a block of wood and a knife and a
81:32 pair of overalls on a rocking chair any
81:34 day over their lives personally I would
81:37 love to in my life that we got my old
81:40 dirty fishin Pole my woman's making
81:44 lemonade so after she had a very long
81:50 satisfying day or so so in closing let
81:55 me just say you know the world would be
81:58 a much better place the more that we
82:00 figure out who we are as people and stop
82:02 trying to please everybody else if you
82:05 find yourself sort of I would almost say
82:09 a victim of this circumstance where you
82:12 do look at your Facebook feed you're
82:14 like my god you know 80 90 percent of my
82:17 posts are really me trying to pretend to
82:19 the world my life is this perfect thing
82:21 and that's sort of the gratification I'm
82:23 looking for with my posts you can always
82:27 delete your posts
82:28 and you can always refresher who you are
82:31 as a person what I love to see in
82:34 people's posts personally personally is
82:36 and I have a couple you buy a half a
82:40 dozen friends in this area that do it
82:42 beautifully is they share their life
82:44 they share their fun times with their
82:46 wives and their kids and you know
82:49 graduation or a birthday or Christmas or
82:52 something like that and that is for me
82:55 the essence of who we are as people
82:57 it's the and even someone this isn't man
83:01 just picture of a wrecked car and I like
83:03 Jesus someone just hit my car I branded
83:06 somebody or my tire blew this morning or
83:08 I woke up my engine wouldn't start you
83:10 know you're just you're looking for some
83:13 support from from the rest of us that's
83:15 life - that's real life and it doesn't
83:19 mean you're a sinner if you post about
83:21 going to a real exotic place and you're
83:23 like this has been my life dream to see
83:25 the pyramids you know post that crap you
83:29 know just add a little bit of context so
83:31 we know why you're doing it and we'll
83:33 all be right behind you cheering you on
83:34 and being happy about it these are my
83:38 personal opinions you know I don't mean
83:39 to offend anyone who believes completely
83:42 different about it but just make sure
83:45 you'd be in genuine with yourself that's
83:48 my advice
83:49 hope you fill me so if you haven't been
83:53 to deep thoughts radio.com as i keep
83:55 saying it's been spiffed up a little bit
83:57 works good on the phone works good on
83:59 your computer there's a search field
84:01 there's a category list I'll make it
84:03 fairly short today there's two feeds for
84:06 video two feats for audio bit shoots a
84:09 little bit behind just in case you
84:10 looking over there and going why am i
84:12 missing a bunch of episodes it's gonna
84:15 be a job getting the season four up
84:16 there we have two social medias one that
84:20 really has conversation and one that
84:21 just has the feed in case you're a big
84:23 Twitter person we have two ways to
84:26 donate to the show we have the all
84:29 remastered season one so if you go to
84:31 this channel and you're looking for
84:32 episode 100 even before they're not
84:36 there because I have unlisted them if
84:38 they're embedded anywhere else in the
84:39 world they will still work but if you
84:40 want to see the true see
84:42 one remastered way better audio levels a
84:44 lot of editing to make things better
84:47 there's a link up there to the other
84:49 YouTube channel so click that subscribe
84:51 to see you have it in your in your feed
84:53 there's a hundred episodes you have to
84:55 get through but it's good and I will
84:57 tell you this one cool thing about being
85:01 the author of the show is that people
85:05 will post those posts where they are in
85:09 a state of need and or they're just
85:12 being inquisitive about something well
85:14 what about this what do you guys think
85:15 about this and I will have done an
85:16 episode on it if they're a close friend
85:18 of mine I will either private chat them
85:20 or if I think it's a real benign episode
85:22 where a lot of people could ingest it
85:24 and it's going to be cool
85:25 I put the thing in the reply and I've
85:28 had some really good successes with that
85:29 people saying oh my god yes made my day
85:32 I just need to talk to someone about it
85:33 and you had an hour and a half about it
85:35 so just know that within the arsenal of
85:38 deep thoughts especially if you're new
85:40 to the channel type keywords into the
85:44 website that are interesting to you and
85:45 you'll find that I've already done
85:47 episodes on it and you may or may not
85:49 agree but remember this if you're new to
85:50 the channel one of the things I always
85:52 tell the listeners is even if you
85:53 disagree with absolutely everything I
85:55 said even in this episode the beautiful
85:58 benefit of disagreeing with me a hundred
86:00 percent is that you find out what you
86:01 really think a hundred percent or more
86:04 towards 100 percent than where you were
86:06 before you started the episode so
86:07 there's a benefit to both sides of the
86:09 equation in my opinion food for thought
86:13 anyway take care of yourself in someone
86:16 else and I will see you in the next deep
86:18 thoughts over now
