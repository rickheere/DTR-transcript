00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen probably get a chance to do
00:38 another one during the day but doing
00:39 those night ones because I my work
00:42 schedules pretty intense right now today
00:46 we're gonna talk about political hatred
00:48 because boy is it a disease we have
00:53 right now in some areas of the world I
00:56 think the good news is is that at least
01:00 in America things are calming down and I
01:06 think people feel comfortable with their
01:08 leader now if you don't you're gonna
01:12 have your political hatred in the middle
01:13 this episode and what a great place to
01:15 be having this emotion this episode is
01:20 gonna be about bad emotion where it
01:22 comes from and the biological and mental
01:26 challenges of maintaining it and where
01:30 you'll probably end up in the end at the
01:35 same time if you think that your site is
01:37 quote unquote winning we need to
01:41 recognize what that really means and I
01:43 think we need to be gracious about our
01:48 feelings in that region
01:50 I had a five-hour conversation in less
01:53 than a week ago with two people
01:56 who are great people who mean well we
02:00 want the world to be a wonderful place
02:02 peaceful happy prosperous but they were
02:09 deathly afraid that I had been one that
02:15 I was ignorant maybe even borderline
02:19 stupid and that somehow my choices in
02:22 life are based on flippin unresearched
02:29 propaganda based opinions of how to
02:33 follow the world and what's funny is
02:35 they've never seen this show and they're
02:38 actually aware that the show exists but
02:41 they don't really think things through
02:43 on their end which is why they're in the
02:45 predicament that they're in there's an
02:48 old saying the pot calling the kettle
02:49 black because the pot is black the irony
02:53 is is that you're calling somebody what
02:56 you are now let's just get one thing out
02:59 of the way real quickly so for those
03:02 that find themselves in hatred or those
03:04 that know people who are in absolute
03:06 hatred mode and this could be anywhere
03:08 in the world this is political hatred
03:11 but this goes for all forms of hatred
03:13 it's very simple the human mind cannot
03:17 hang on to anger and hatred for
03:19 prolonged periods of time because it's
03:27 job is to refuse that one emotion from
03:31 your psyche it's where you get lower
03:34 back pain TMS a lot of other health
03:38 issues your body will attempt to
03:40 distract you if you start to have
03:41 horrific thoughts in your mind a hatred
03:44 can slip past TMS TMS is often related
03:48 to very acute horrible situations rape
03:53 you know some event like maybe you
03:56 witnessed a murder or something really
03:57 horrendous but hatred takes a lot out of
04:02 you doesn't it
04:04 every day you wake up in some form of
04:06 hatred you are dying
04:09 your genetics are dying your body
04:13 doesn't understand the specifics of the
04:15 emotion it just simply understands that
04:18 we feel angsty and angsty is essentially
04:21 the opposite of love hatred is the
04:26 opposite of love now usually in America
04:31 this is gonna be mainly an American
04:32 based political episode because they
04:34 don't have intimate knowledge of other
04:36 countries as I usually say
04:39 typically we vacillate between democrat
04:42 for eight years republican for eight
04:44 years and it just goes back and forth or
04:46 back and forth and you'll have your sort
04:49 of your average citizen saying we'll see
04:52 that's healthy we go back and forth and
04:54 if it does go to the other side the
04:57 other candidates yeah they're not loved
05:00 necessarily by the opposite party but
05:04 they're seldom hated by the other party
05:08 and the press which tells you one way or
05:12 the other
05:14 typically doesn't focus on how horrible
05:18 the other candidate is if they are
05:20 supposedly biased in one direction on
05:22 the United States of America we have
05:27 like six sources of news major networks
05:31 and like we have ABC NBC CBS then we
05:34 have CNN MSNBC all lefty organizations
05:39 and then we have Fox which is the one
05:41 alternative for the right and they sort
05:44 of ride they sort of walk the razor
05:46 blade right down the center they don't
05:48 really take any truly Pro left or Pro
05:51 right things they sort of walk right
05:53 down the middle which means we don't
05:55 really have a group that is for the
05:57 right we really don't but in the past
06:00 again when someone gets into the
06:02 presidency the right you know doesn't
06:08 destroy the left the left doesn't
06:09 destroy the right in the press oh
06:10 they'll be hit pieces here and there but
06:13 it's not a constant barrage where
06:14 everything is spun against someone but
06:18 that's what happened in this last term
06:20 so the thing that's unique about the
06:23 election in 2016 is that you have the
06:32 left who expected to win they were set
06:35 up to win they got picked up by Andre
06:41 the Giant who then body slammed them on
06:44 his knee and broke their back
06:47 it was abrupt it was unplanned by them
06:52 and he'll I can tell you being in this
06:54 country and rooting for the other person
06:56 I didn't think he had a chance because I
06:58 thought the thing was so rigged that he
07:00 just couldn't make it and then a miracle
07:03 happened the first president in nearly
07:06 60 years that hasn't been a part of some
07:08 secret society became president and back
07:14 in the day it was sort of incidental
07:16 whether or not you were in a secret
07:17 society everyone was a Mason the big
07:20 deal I can assure you right now that if
07:23 I personally became famous for some I
07:26 don't know moral invention right I
07:29 created the zero-point energy system I
07:30 figured the antigravity or whatever I
07:32 would be told that I was a 33 degree
07:35 Mason I would be invited into that
07:38 organization I would be showing up at
07:40 some party perhaps they wouldn't even
07:41 tell me why they're inviting me if I
07:44 walk into the Masonic Lodge I go up to
07:47 some secret room they like just they
07:48 just keep telling me all the parties in
07:50 here the parties in here keep coming
07:51 keep coming this is the special backroom
07:53 that we use only every one small because
07:54 you're so special we're using it and
07:55 then before I know it some guy walks up
07:58 to me and puts an apron around the front
08:00 some dudes behind him ties it up they
08:02 snapped a shot and I'm forever I'm a 33
08:05 degree Mason but that was all ceremonial
08:08 for that organization it's not to say
08:09 they aren't powerful because they are
08:11 when they want to be right now secret
08:14 societies up until Donald Trump it is
08:19 the mechanism by which you are selected
08:24 to be in the group now again I think the
08:28 misnomer about a lot of us is that all
08:30 these folks are completely in agreeance
08:31 and they all get together and it's a
08:33 high
08:33 five there and past the hotdogs there I
08:35 think it's completely blown apart I
08:38 think that these deep state
08:40 organizations are absolutely all on edge
08:43 I think they're scared to call each
08:46 other well you call both we can't call
08:48 them first because if we call the first
08:49 that makes us seem weak and edited out
08:51 you know and I think well let's just
08:52 send a messenger around yeah why don't
08:53 you send someone over the country club
08:54 and have a really tiny conversation
08:56 there I think that's the way it is today
08:57 I think they're completely
08:58 discombobulated perhaps a couple of them
09:02 are meeting but overall I think they're
09:05 completely blown apart and I think that
09:12 because there's been a huge fracture in
09:14 the spying organization that spies on
09:16 the world instead of being under one
09:18 roof
09:20 they now know that there's one person in
09:23 there you know I don't mean to say a
09:26 person but you know there's one group
09:27 that is now spying back the other
09:31 direction against the spiders and
09:34 they're not just doing it they're
09:36 writing down charges and saying you know
09:39 as soon as we get the chance to pull you
09:40 guys into litigation we're gonna destroy
09:44 you and quite frankly there could be a
09:47 lot of military activity as well that
09:50 we're just unaware of and I could be
09:54 wrong but there's a lot of I think
09:57 fairly believable evidence that this
09:59 could be occurring we have a lot of
10:01 planes falling out of the sky and
10:02 training missions we have soldiers
10:04 getting killed in weird places that we
10:05 didn't know they were but this five our
10:08 conversation was extremely valuable and
10:11 that we covered a lot of subjects we
10:12 cover things from the moon missions to
10:14 how the earth is put together how it
10:17 expands and then all the way into the
10:21 political agendas that are going on who
10:24 q and on is you know the q and on thing
10:29 for me is just really peculiar because
10:31 you know give you an example
10:37 and for those of you don't know queuing
10:39 on is we can't cover it in this episode
10:41 as an initiative thing that you must
10:44 learn there's an episode back there
10:46 about 20 episodes that you can look up
10:47 he was queueing on I did suspend the
10:52 queue moment episode because I think
10:54 that that is perhaps based on a lie and
10:58 there's a piece of information that was
11:00 leaked and people molded it on the
11:02 outside of cue and I made an episode
11:06 about if this particular piece of truth
11:07 is true and I'm gonna wait for that to
11:10 become true before I rereleased that
11:12 episode but the cute guy will post
11:16 things that seem to be absolutely
11:17 ironclad meaning things that he couldn't
11:22 get unless he was a part of Trump's
11:24 organization
11:25 I do think q+ sounds exactly like Trump
11:28 talking and he only talks a little
11:30 breviary sort of positive senses but
11:35 then there's a lot of sort of [ __ ] cold
11:37 reading going on that could be that this
11:43 guy's completely innocent of a lot of
11:44 the assertions that are made on him and
11:46 one thing that pops up a lot of dates he
11:49 uses a ton of numbers and very cryptic
11:51 ways and we try to make sense of it and
11:54 in some cases we do believe that there
11:56 are incredible credibly specific dates
12:00 for things and then he will let that go
12:03 and of course the anons are going crazy
12:04 the people that respond to him are going
12:06 crazy all these critiquing YouTube
12:08 channels that are trying to get it right
12:10 okay they get it
12:12 misconstrued because it just takes one
12:14 idea that a little seed from an anon
12:16 saying oh I bet that means June you know
12:19 11th and then everyone goes nuts about
12:21 what's gonna happen on June 11th and of
12:23 course the date rolls around and things
12:24 happen but nothing that's kind of boom
12:26 ish and then queueing on will come out
12:31 and say well when the hell did I say
12:32 June 11th I didn't say it about June
12:34 11th it's like okay dude if you see the
12:37 whole world going down the wrong path
12:38 and you really want to correct this
12:40 planet you cannot in my opinion just let
12:42 it go you've got to come in and say guys
12:45 relax on the 11th okay it's not what you
12:47 think do your research look back you
12:48 know more than you know
12:50 right I don't think that the political
12:53 hatred can physically continue to exist
12:56 in anyone's body you know there's the
12:59 old saying if you can't beat them join
13:00 them
13:01 and a lot of times and you hear that as
13:03 a kid and you're a patriotic child you
13:06 think yeah man I'm never gonna be a
13:07 [ __ ] and you know join the bad guys I
13:10 don't have a price and that's good but
13:14 your brain can't sit around waking up
13:17 every day in hatred we are now getting a
13:20 tremendous amount of converts from the
13:23 liberal left which is it's you know and
13:27 I want to say it's okay to be liberal
13:29 it's okay to be a Democrat I just think
13:33 that if you want to be a part of that
13:35 party you can no longer carry with you
13:38 the icons of Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer
13:40 Bernie Sanders you need a whole new gang
13:44 of people a whole new group and you need
13:46 to really sit down and think about what
13:48 your message is because right now the
13:49 message has been destroyed by those
13:52 people Hillary Clinton Obama all these
13:55 people have destroyed your message into
13:57 an absolute obscurity right you need to
14:01 live for a purpose you need to have a
14:04 clear agenda
14:05 it can't be shrouded in a bunch of you
14:08 know back-handed globalism right where
14:11 global isms agenda in this world is
14:13 shadow agenda they won't tell you what
14:16 they're doing because a few are going to
14:18 rule a mini an amazing way but of course
14:22 there's a technique that's being used by
14:25 the deep state and that is that they are
14:28 taking everything that's acidic and true
14:31 about them that is negative and evil you
14:34 could say it's not a religious evil
14:35 thing it's just you know not good for
14:37 man and they are projecting it on the
14:40 right and saying well there's rich
14:43 people and that that group over there
14:44 it's like yeah there are rich people on
14:47 this group over here because we work
14:48 [ __ ] hard
14:49 we have great education and we don't try
14:52 to live off the state like Bernie
14:53 Sanders until you sweat 40 [ __ ] years
14:55 old he gets his first job wherever he
14:57 gets anything and that's becoming a
14:58 senator you know become a politician
15:01 no yeah we work really hard and we
15:04 believe in the Constitution we believe
15:06 that the Second Amendment protects first
15:07 we don't believe the second moment has
15:09 anything to do with hunting we have a
15:12 pretty good memory of history we know
15:15 that as all these Democrats walk in
15:19 public events with no less than 30 to
15:21 100 hidden guns and various devices for
15:27 self-defense they're trying to take all
15:30 those things away from us so that we
15:32 have absolutely no means of touching
15:34 them and then they're going to own the
15:36 world and when you have to live when you
15:42 choose to live off the dole your IQ goes
15:44 down right when you choose to manipulate
15:47 and not work hard your IQ goes through
15:50 the floor you become an ignorant human
15:53 being because someone else is providing
15:55 you your sustenance if I put you on a
16:00 desert island and I kept bringing you
16:02 all the food and everything that you
16:05 needed everything you wanted not even
16:06 just needed but what you would be an
16:08 ignorant fat body on that island
16:10 wouldn't you but if I said tough [ __ ]
16:13 [ __ ] you see that coconut tree that's
16:18 like 90% of your food supply right there
16:19 see that ocean it's all full of salt
16:22 you're gonna to figure out how to
16:23 desalinate that or you die see you later
16:28 the wisdom that you will create if you
16:31 are going to survive will be beyond
16:33 anything that you have ever achieved in
16:35 your life and if I brought you back
16:38 after ten years of doing that and put
16:40 you in the real world you would just
16:44 conquer this place like nothing flat
16:46 because I mean you have no idea how much
16:48 you have food and resources and denta to
16:50 do it's weird i sat with these two
16:53 people and they talked as if there's no
16:56 rich people on the left and when anyone
16:59 when any of the subjects was disputed
17:01 with alternate facts with again people
17:05 on the ground who saw these things you
17:10 know I would say something like well you
17:12 know you say that organization is good
17:14 but there have actually been
17:15 people caught at these locations
17:17 conducting the worst crimes human
17:19 trafficking that you've ever seen they
17:23 actually told me I mean this is
17:25 interesting it's a psychosis I mean it's
17:27 really really weird they said well those
17:30 charges could have been faked they had
17:33 an excuse for everything and they would
17:36 quote that New Yorker magazine or
17:38 something like just extreme left sources
17:42 so that they never had to come out of
17:44 their hatred bubble but meanwhile their
17:48 in their hatred bubble electively in
17:51 their hatred bubble trying to
17:53 cannibalize all the calorie energy that
17:55 they consume into essentially a an acid
18:00 within their body so that they don't
18:05 have to be wrong but now they're kind of
18:09 trying to go to the next level but they
18:11 aren't that smart it's interesting part
18:18 of them are saying let's burn the world
18:19 to the ground because if we burn the
18:22 world to the ground I never have to say
18:25 that I'm wrong because the evidence of
18:28 me being wrong burns down with it and
18:31 you know and there are little hearts
18:32 they'll be like okay now I don't have to
18:34 hate the world I just have to survive it
18:37 and they know they cheated deep down
18:41 inside after the world goes to some
18:43 horrible whatever they can just go if I
18:47 survive this then I don't have to ever
18:49 admit I was wrong but the problem is
18:50 they carry that corrupt DNA to the next
18:52 generation of the survivors in America
18:56 we have the two parties and you know of
19:00 course there's this constant dispute of
19:05 who's good and who's bad now social
19:10 media it's interesting and and you know
19:11 my personal conversations in large part
19:16 echo what I see in social media so I
19:19 think it's fairly accurate there are
19:21 people that hate Donald Trump and people
19:25 who hate Barack Obama
19:27 and what's interesting is is the
19:30 correlation that I see in my world is
19:34 that you typically like a politician
19:38 let's just stay with two males because
19:41 we haven't had a female president yet
19:42 the women look at the president and they
19:45 say would I date or marry that person
19:49 that's how they decide whether or not
19:51 they like the president of United States
19:52 for the men they say what I like to hang
19:56 out with that guy
19:57 as the besties right what I want to do
20:01 whatever we would do and that's how you
20:04 choose your president as to whether or
20:06 not you like them what I'm finding
20:09 categorically is that the alpha males
20:12 and Omega females who are confident in
20:16 themselves and intelligent and
20:17 accomplished really accomplished right
20:21 they went out on their own they didn't
20:22 just again suck the dole take a
20:25 retirement package work for the
20:26 government whatever I'm not to say
20:29 there's any limitations here but those
20:31 those folks love Trump they would marry
20:37 that women would marry him and they take
20:39 everything that comes with that right
20:41 maybe sleeps with some chick on the side
20:43 or whatever they take it like that's an
20:45 amazing man I just married if nothing
20:48 else he's going to be a leader he's
20:49 gonna keep me safe he's strong I don't
20:51 worry about [ __ ] in terms of the dudes
20:54 pop out our cigars we hang with a wise
20:58 man that was able to parlay a million
21:02 dollars into ten billion and for those
21:04 of you [ __ ] who keep saying he got
21:06 twenty two hundred million you know
21:08 despite his all of his family members
21:10 completely saying that wasn't true again
21:12 there's a ton of people in Newport Beach
21:14 about five miles from where I'm sitting
21:17 that have a billion in the bank and they
21:18 will never ever ever see 10 billion
21:20 because they don't have the wisdom to
21:22 get it so I don't give a [ __ ] if that
21:25 guy started with a billion making it 10
21:26 is massive but on the Obama side do you
21:33 have almost categorically every female
21:36 I've ever met and every male that I've
21:38 ever met who
21:40 fess almost an angelic way you know the
21:46 conversation I had was very surprising
21:49 to me because it was very angelic
21:53 this man was was Jesus Christ on earth
21:55 of fact I would say that at least one
21:57 person the conversation defended Obama
22:00 more than they have ever defended Jesus
22:02 Christ of whom they believe is a real
22:04 being all the females and you know a lot
22:07 of more celebrities that I know they
22:10 date safe they're scared they're scared
22:14 of the world they're scared of men and
22:16 you know quite frankly I think I know a
22:19 couple that have really suffered the me
22:21 - problem they've been harassed by men
22:23 and so they probably have legitimate
22:26 reasons to be afraid of a confident male
22:29 the men well they aren't alpha males
22:33 I'll tell you how much I sent a plane
22:35 yesterday four dudes around me three of
22:38 which were definitely Obama supporters
22:44 how do I know that well two of them were
22:46 talking about it the whole time and the
22:48 funny thing was I'm sitting on this
22:49 plane I listen to these guys in the
22:53 front row and they look fairly
22:58 successful right they you know one of
23:00 them probably got the preferred you know
23:01 hit pay the extra 25 bucks to get in the
23:04 front of the Southwest flight I was
23:05 flying so they're millionaires right
23:10 they're dressed well they look groomed I
23:13 think one of them was a doctor like a
23:16 physical doctor and they were having a
23:21 gay old time bashing the president and
23:24 bashing everyone who likes the president
23:26 and what was interesting was is that
23:29 they they sounded like complete [ __ ]
23:33 idiots their English was poor the jokes
23:39 that they were telling where the most
23:41 lowbrow just you know if you had to
23:45 guess the kind of jokes they were making
23:46 about the people who support Trump if I
23:49 gave you a piece of paper in an hour you
23:50 would probably guess in 90% of what they
23:52 said
23:53 you know one of them was one that really
23:55 got him all riled up and laughing was
23:57 that the number of teeth and the Trump
24:01 supporter is you know drastically below
24:05 average essentially insulting the entire
24:10 Midwest region region of this entire
24:12 country and they felt intelligent making
24:17 just no points at all never talking
24:20 about individual policies or ideas or
24:23 accomplishments you know there are there
24:26 are legitimate theories of why things
24:29 will fail under the Trump Organization
24:31 but you have to subscribe to the
24:33 paradigm of Finance that these theories
24:36 yield themselves to but in the end it's
24:38 at least a legitimate theory if you
24:41 follow that path at this you know the
24:43 tax cuts might turn into a recession
24:46 right at least that's intelligent at
24:50 least I can see where you're coming from
24:52 but the other guy next to me was just
24:54 sitting on his laptop
24:56 a really old guy and he was just reading
25:01 every hit piece on the North Korean
25:03 talks why it's not any good and why you
25:06 know we're stupid and busted it's like
25:09 okay these aren't strong males they just
25:13 aren't they're scared of a strong male
25:17 because they know that when they get in
25:18 the room with the strong male if there's
25:20 a female right there who doesn't want to
25:23 date safe he ain't getting her which
25:28 means he hates this other guy because
25:31 this other guys gonna get her
25:32 it's unequivocally he's going to get her
25:35 and I know that sounds petty but you
25:37 need you need to understand inside all
25:39 of us as a kid and we use that that gut
25:43 heart whatever instinctual feeling to
25:47 mitigate our insecurities when you
25:51 become confident in yourself you don't
25:54 have these problems you walk around the
25:57 world like your own little King your own
25:59 little queen and you know you're not
26:01 dominating anyone at all it's not a
26:03 monarchy but in your own brain you're
26:04 like I at least control
26:07 this you know my flesh my bones i I
26:10 control it I I know what I look like
26:11 when I walk down the street cause in my
26:13 brain I've seen myself walk enough and I
26:14 don't feel insecure about that yeah you
26:17 know maybe I'm a little overweight or
26:19 maybe I'm not the stunning version of
26:23 the male or female form but I'm okay
26:26 with that
26:27 I know I'm a good person and I know
26:29 people like talking to me and that's
26:31 where you gain your confidence from from
26:32 within I think confidence in general is
26:36 something that lacks in the Obama
26:39 worshiping camp that's why they prey on
26:42 the disenfranchised they are a franchise
26:44 of disenfranchised people so I'm I am I
26:48 just sitting here picking on the the
26:49 left and not picking on the right well
26:53 right now in this country we just got
26:57 done tolerating a president for eight
26:59 years that was given a Nobel Peace Prize
27:03 on the first day of his office and the
27:06 theory there just to defend the left a
27:07 little bit is that they the Nobel
27:10 organization was trying to sway Obama to
27:15 their side by giving him the award and
27:17 there may be some truth in that I never
27:18 really thought about that and some pick
27:20 him out of this five-hour conversation
27:26 but the guy who went off and kept seven
27:28 theatres of war going we destroyed Egypt
27:32 we destroyed Libya they're now selling
27:35 human beings for 800 bucks in Libya it's
27:39 just been a mess it's just been a
27:41 complete mess and now we're
27:47 denuclearizing North Korea potentially
27:50 right but the entire time that Obama is
27:53 in office
27:54 five out of six news organizations in
27:57 the United States of America praise this
27:59 guy no matter if he took a [ __ ] on
28:00 somebody's head he could do no wrong
28:04 there was no critique of this man I had
28:06 a five out of six arteries and you know
28:09 Fox pretends to be right I think there's
28:12 some people that are fairly decent I
28:15 think Hannity is pretty cool I think
28:16 that and Kennedy's been an [ __ ] at
28:19 times okay
28:20 give you an example of where Hannity
28:23 owes the entire world an apology that
28:26 I've never heard given at least Geraldo
28:28 Rivera did the same thing Hannity did
28:31 which I'm about to tell you he
28:32 apologized on the air so for me he has
28:36 paid his penance to the American
28:39 population but Hannity chastised those
28:44 who questioned 9/11 horribly especially
28:47 I think especially dr. Steven Jones from
28:49 Brigham Young University who proved
28:52 beyond a shadow of a doubt that
28:53 explosives were used in the building
28:55 called thermite slash thermate once it's
29:00 mixed with more sulfur to increase its
29:02 melting level eventually found these
29:07 little signatures on some steel that was
29:11 donated to a museum but he was just
29:15 barreled over by Hannity I think handed
29:17 he's doing good things now but I think
29:19 that we want to clear the whole slate
29:21 right prove to me you're on board and
29:23 you're not just doing what will make you
29:26 popular today I guess you won could have
29:28 both opinions but I think that
29:30 photographic proof and chemical proof is
29:34 something that's pretty difficult to
29:35 dispute tucker is the other one on Fox I
29:39 think I saw a private interview with him
29:41 I think he's really starting to think
29:43 about who he is as a human being he has
29:45 children he understands that regardless
29:48 of how much he gets paid at some point
29:50 the truth has got to come through let's
29:52 hope he sticks to that he's a very
29:54 clever fast wooded person Tucker Carlson
29:58 right and there are individuals on the
30:01 left and there are five organizations
30:02 that from time to time will surprise us
30:05 and say something very lucid so that's
30:10 good
30:11 but this episode is about political
30:13 hatred right so where does it come from
30:18 well imagine this imagine you don't have
30:22 anything to do with the health of the
30:25 oceans you don't know anything about how
30:28 many fish are in the ocean you don't
30:30 know anything about whaling or dolphin
30:33 killing or
30:35 nuclear-waste coming out of Fukushima
30:37 and putting all the isotopes on the
30:39 bottom of the ocean which is them eaten
30:40 by crustaceans which are then eaten by
30:42 midium medium-sized fish which are then
30:45 eaten by bluefin tuna which then
30:48 migrates over here gets caught and gets
30:49 put in all your sushi you don't know any
30:52 of that and you're never gonna ever get
30:54 involved in you're not you're never
30:55 gonna be shocked Cousteau this is never
30:59 gonna happen okay but you have a soft
31:04 spot or inside your heart you want the
31:06 oceans to be very very safe and
31:09 beautiful and natural maybe you like
31:12 scuba diving or deep-sea diving but
31:14 again you don't know anything empirical
31:16 about the oceans health and ecosystem so
31:19 what is your choice for forming an
31:21 opinion about that you're going to have
31:24 to rely on individuals that devote their
31:26 lives to this preservation of the oceans
31:30 health well who owns the ocean mmm well
31:36 a bunch of different countries that have
31:37 coastal regions on the ocean and then
31:39 there's neutral ocean where anyone could
31:40 do anything that they want there's some
31:42 international bodies trying to protect
31:44 that whole problem and you know even
31:47 though you know 2/3 of the countries in
31:50 the world agreed to not kill whales well
31:52 Japan just says [ __ ] you and kills wells
31:56 all right so you're gonna have to get
32:01 all of your opinions from someone else
32:02 and I mean all of your opinions you
32:06 might do some fact-checking online and
32:08 look up some treaties and look up some
32:10 photographs but even the treaties the
32:12 treaties are actually more black and
32:14 white in terms of what people agreed to
32:15 do but if you look at photographs well
32:17 who who is taking the photographs and
32:19 putting them online and then when you
32:21 look at a photograph what do you have to
32:22 do I mean seriously in the real world
32:24 what do you have to do with the
32:25 photograph you have to interpret the
32:27 photograph if someone writes a caption
32:31 below that photo then you have to
32:34 discern whether or not that captions
32:36 exit true about that photograph right
32:38 there are events in history which are
32:42 being retold reinvestigated and all the
32:47 captions and all the
32:48 you've ever heard about certain
32:49 photographs and certain movies of
32:50 certain events are being completely
32:52 redone from scratch with empirical
32:55 evidence as opposed to fictitious
32:58 revision of revisions of history right
33:02 so you know that if you were to try to
33:04 get involved with the ocean by listening
33:06 to other people but never actually
33:07 getting in the ocean yourself and
33:09 believing it's a big place right you're
33:13 gonna have to rely on other people all
33:14 right we got that established well
33:17 that's a moment of absolute
33:18 vulnerability for you you're deriving
33:22 all of your information from someone
33:23 else you don't have enough hours in the
33:27 day perhaps you need science I don't
33:30 know to figure out some of some of this
33:31 is true
33:32 and I will tell you in this world
33:35 categorically every single place there's
33:38 a black hole of knowledge there is a
33:42 group trying to exacerbate the fear in
33:45 that hole
33:46 such that they can extort out of you
33:49 money and eventually pass legislation to
33:52 control you we're gonna go over a few of
33:55 these okay climatology is a mystery to
33:58 people climatology gets into so many
34:03 different divisions of how one
34:05 determines what happened in the past
34:06 versus what's happening now that they
34:09 can lie lie lie if someone were to drill
34:14 ice at the North Pole or ice in the
34:17 South Pole and then pull it out and tell
34:19 you what's in this this cylinder of ice
34:23 by crushing it and trying to study the
34:25 air quality it does it you have no clue
34:29 whether or not they're bullshitting you
34:30 or not the science could be sound but
34:32 what they put on the ground or the
34:35 results that they record in some way off
34:37 and be of Egypt place could simply be
34:40 forged in fake temperatures of the ocean
34:44 floors which gets everybody all riled up
34:46 well who would pay for such a thing
34:49 right as they're set in previous
34:51 episodes who would pay for that the the
34:53 boobies that sit out there in the middle
34:55 and pay for all that equipment to be
34:56 turned on and kept electrocute you know
34:59 electrified and then to bring in the
35:01 results
35:02 people with agendas pay for that kind of
35:04 [ __ ] and the second that that happens
35:06 all you do is drop that thing in the
35:07 middle the ocean say it's there say
35:09 you're getting serial data import from
35:11 that object and you just report whatever
35:13 you want to keep the fear and the
35:16 agendas moving forward the manipulation
35:18 on society we've talked about on the
35:21 show several times there's two events
35:23 that NASA hangs on to when they need to
35:25 get money they tell you the story about
35:28 a big meteorite coming in and somehow
35:30 they're gonna be the ones to chase it
35:33 off just like the movie Armageddon we
35:36 don't have any of that in recorded
35:37 history
35:38 sure looks like meteorite impacts or
35:41 volcanic explosions instead of
35:44 meteorites what's the second one the
35:48 second one is actually kind of important
35:49 to mention because there's been this a
35:50 sin uation from queuing on that there's
35:53 a planned sky oven he's been saying this
35:55 for about six months a worldwide false
35:59 flag weather event now the only one that
36:02 I can possibly think about that's a
36:03 weather event it's not going to be a
36:05 hurricane it's not gonna be a tidal wave
36:07 it's not going to be tornadoes rain
36:12 storms probably not a volcano because
36:15 that's a ground event that creates the
36:16 sky event what is the big sky event that
36:20 could occur I can only think of two
36:24 somehow they put a bunch of crap in
36:26 space and throw it down to earth and
36:29 just you know satellites are falling out
36:32 of the sky but they're moving so fast
36:33 they call them meteorites or whatever
36:36 that big meteorite that went over or
36:39 whatever the hell it was that went over
36:40 Russia a few years back and exploded and
36:42 blew out all the windows Russia came out
36:44 and said that was a CIA weapon who knows
36:47 I don't know but what's the big event
36:51 that we keep getting threatened with a
36:53 coronal mass ejection a CME or what some
36:58 people call a solar flare
37:02 now again I've explained it on the show
37:04 several times but let's go ahead and go
37:06 with the panic attack the idea is that
37:08 this this big solar flare comes and
37:11 again right now as I'm sitting in this
37:13 backyard
37:14 no one knows there is no science to
37:18 predict coronal mass ejections only
37:22 sunspots have been correlated with CME's
37:25 but now let's let's talk about the math
37:28 of this real quickly I won't even use
37:30 math okay so you guys just sit tight if
37:32 the Sun was the size of a basketball
37:34 which is about a 10 inch diameter and
37:36 you put it on the ground you would have
37:39 to walk I believe about 36 feet away
37:42 earth would be the size of one third of
37:44 a period on a piece of paper so you
37:47 would struggle to create a tick on a
37:49 piece of paper that isn't bigger than
37:51 the earth I had this assignment and
37:53 astronomy class when I was in high
37:55 school I had to walk about 36 feet out
37:58 and then put it in the ground and a
37:59 little pin so you have this 10 inch ball
38:02 that is constantly ejecting its heat now
38:08 every CME is prokhor errors sorry
38:10 observed to come back to even if it
38:13 ejects a bunch of stuff 97% of
38:15 everything comes back to the surface of
38:17 the Sun and this is on the biggest ones
38:20 out there for the teeny ones it's a
38:21 hundred percent almost all the time
38:23 comes back to the Sun so of the three
38:26 percent that can escape and a gigantic
38:28 CME
38:29 okay it's got to be thrown directly at
38:33 the earth and it's got to take into
38:36 account the orbital pattern of the you
38:39 know earth around the Sun and then it's
38:43 got to keep this condensed heat together
38:49 for 93 or 9:00 was a 93 million miles
38:52 right all the way to earth and it's
38:55 never going to happen
38:56 study chemistry study diffusion it's the
38:59 same thing in space it's going to
39:02 diffuse before it hits earth so the
39:06 little tiny minuscule amount that can
39:08 hit earth is always easily deflected by
39:10 what oh the Van Allen belts the
39:14 electrical force field that we have
39:16 on the earth because the Earth's core is
39:17 a plasma energy core
39:19 remember nickel iron loses all of its
39:22 magnetism at a certain melting point
39:25 that is way way way below what they say
39:28 the center of the earth actually is in
39:31 terms of heat so it's all electricity in
39:34 the center so global warming is [ __ ]
39:38 meteorites hitting Earth well that's
39:41 probably the closest crazy story that
39:43 could possibly happen but again we've
39:45 never seen it in recorded history we
39:47 have the 1908 Russian thing that
39:49 happened but who knows what the hell
39:50 that was
39:50 didn't it definitely destroyed some
39:52 forests but hardly a problem that we
39:56 couldn't deal with and then CME's how
40:01 does a political party take advantage of
40:02 your absence of knowledge they always
40:05 have a theory that is pessimistic to
40:08 tell you about everything great that
40:10 ever happens I will tell you that the
40:12 easiest way to get yourself out of left
40:15 delusion is to simply acknowledge the
40:17 fact that the last eight years and the
40:21 last eight years before that by a
40:22 Republican it sucked
40:27 Clinton got to reign over this
40:30 serendipitous thing that happened called
40:31 the Internet so he got credit for the
40:33 Internet and the big economic boom of
40:35 the Internet he had nothing to do with
40:37 it okay he just happened to be president
40:39 at that time
40:40 lucky him okay by the way I bumped into
40:44 a guy a week ago and again take this
40:47 with a grain of salt I had a pretty good
40:50 30 minute conversation with the guy
40:52 seemed fairly legit he told me he was
40:54 friends with George Bush jr. on a
40:58 personal level I guess he went to school
40:59 with him or something and he said the
41:02 secret is is that George Bush jr. loves
41:04 Trump and he he's very happy that he's
41:08 in office I thought that was interesting
41:12 but the United States of America for
41:15 instance was going down the [ __ ] tubes
41:18 we were giving away all the rights to
41:20 everything we were losing all of our
41:22 [ __ ] money we're sending pallets of
41:24 cash to tyrannical terrorist
41:26 organizations our countries that support
41:28 such things
41:29 we were going more and welfare than ever
41:32 our jobs were disappearing overseas the
41:36 unemployment rates were up at
41:38 astronomical levels stock market was
41:41 okay but it was on the verge of
41:43 potential collapse and I will tell you
41:46 that just prior to the election and
41:49 hanging out in the circles that I was
41:50 hanging out with at the time I'm sitting
41:53 with some of the world's most wealthy
41:54 people in the United States and they
41:57 were really terrified of what the stock
42:00 market was going to do if it continued
42:02 on the current track that it's on and
42:04 now that it's up 40 percent or whatever
42:06 was seven trillion dollars in value
42:07 injected into the value of the stock
42:10 market plus our economy they're no
42:14 longer having the concerns that they've
42:15 had but now what are the other tools
42:18 that they use to keep you hating
42:20 everything they do the game of the haves
42:23 and the have-nots those rich people this
42:27 is a classic one I got several times in
42:29 my five-hour conversation well the
42:33 Republicans are all rich people and we
42:35 [ __ ] hate rich people and so I
42:38 stopped the guy and I say look so a
42:41 person who works really really hard to
42:44 create an empire to create a company
42:46 they're still alive they're still you
42:49 know the founder and CEO of the company
42:51 which a lot of companies have no
42:52 founders and CEOs anymore right I said
42:56 you really think that you deserve their
42:59 money when you're not working as hard as
43:01 they are you're not taking any risks and
43:05 he goes no no no I don't think that I
43:07 say okay so what's your alternative and
43:08 the guy just went like oh [ __ ] I'm
43:11 caught I'm caught in this [ __ ]
43:12 paradigm of hatred I'm using this kind
43:14 of lowbrow shitty mechanism to win an
43:17 argument and he just basically gave me
43:20 this kind of flubby symbolic answer of
43:25 well I just think that there's a
43:27 different way to redistribute the wealth
43:29 okay no plan hasn't thought it through
43:32 and he came to me with basically theft
43:37 as the mechanism to solve his problem
43:42 always work for someone else's entire
43:44 life always played it safe and there's
43:46 nothing wrong with that but don't go in
43:49 trying to tell people how the world
43:51 works cuz you have no [ __ ] clue dude
43:53 you have no [ __ ] clue if you have not
43:55 been an entrepreneur in your life and
43:57 built a company up from scratch and
43:59 earned at least a million dollars as of
44:02 2018
44:03 ok you have no clue you know if you
44:08 haven't filed a business license and and
44:11 had to get health insurance for your
44:12 employees and deal with everything
44:16 finding new clients fulfilling contracts
44:19 you know writing your own contracts you
44:21 don't screw yourself all these things
44:23 you have no [ __ ] clue so you're
44:26 trying to participate in a conversation
44:28 that is well beyond your expertise to
44:30 understand now to have well I should say
44:36 this much every group has an age range
44:39 what is surprising to me is that you
44:42 have extremely wealthy
44:44 I guess baby boomers in some room
44:47 probably mostly baby boomers super duper
44:52 angry worried
44:53 super duper angry was it Robert De Niro
44:57 unbelievable guy right goes out and he's
45:01 sucking his third iteration of dropping
45:03 f-bombs and threatening the President of
45:05 the United States physically which i
45:07 think is the brother needs a little
45:09 visit there's free speech and then
45:12 there's assault if I said on this show
45:16 I'm gonna hurt anyone out there in the
45:18 real world I've made a threat it's me
45:21 passively assaulting another person if
45:23 that person happens to watch the video
45:24 and those that I'm talking directly to
45:25 them then it's no different than me
45:28 leaving a voicemail on their phone are
45:30 sending them an email threatening them
45:32 but somehow celebrities have this pass
45:36 they can [ __ ] do anything and oh by
45:38 the way if you call yourself a comedian
45:40 holy [ __ ] you can do anything you can
45:42 possibly imagine and it's it's legal
45:45 it's free consequently I think it's very
45:48 interesting that and I'm you know I have
45:52 been a fan of De Niro I think I said in
45:54 season one
45:55 one of the movies that he did that
45:57 really blew me away was called awakening
45:59 where he played a as a true story about
46:02 a kid who was in a coma for something
46:05 like 20 years they gave him a chemical
46:09 for a different illness and I can't
46:11 remember what that was but it woke him
46:12 up and in real life this character had a
46:15 few months or maybe even a year of
46:18 consciousness and then the drug was
46:21 being fought by the body and he went
46:23 back down for the rest of his life his
46:24 last name was the same as mine in real
46:25 life but dinero played this character
46:27 with Robin Williams as the doctor and I
46:30 think he did an unbelievable job Oscar
46:33 award-winning performance if there ever
46:35 was one on film but look at you know the
46:38 majority of what mr. De Niro has done he
46:41 has done movies about being a Bambino he
46:44 has perpetuated this stereotype of
46:46 Italians sort of being stupid and evil
46:52 the Italians I know are anything like
46:55 that guy I dude do you have some Italian
46:58 friends that didn't grow up in those
47:00 circles and they have fun as actors
47:02 portraying the same thing because that's
47:04 what Hollywood wants okay but they're
47:06 also now walking around some hate bubble
47:08 right they know they're playing a
47:09 character sure a cartoon of their own
47:11 race right De Niro is also gravitated
47:17 towards movies that involve rape Cape
47:22 Fear is nothing more than a pedophile
47:25 [Music]
47:26 rapists right because he wants to rape
47:28 the mother and eventually rape the
47:30 daughter and terrorized the father and
47:32 that's what the movies about oh it's a
47:36 thriller all right there's movies where
47:39 he's in the film maybe five minutes and
47:41 he's sort of you know kind of he's
47:45 having sex with a girl in the kitchen
47:46 real fast she's not exactly fighting him
47:48 but again he has been at the center of
47:52 immorality in this country as the
47:55 fictional character and that guy he has
47:57 enough juice I would think to pick
48:00 whatever the hell he wants to be a part
48:02 of what if someone offered Harrison Ford
48:04 a twenty million dollars to rape a kid
48:06 in a movie or even rape a woman a grown
48:09 woman I don't think he would take the
48:12 job because he's gonna look at his own
48:14 heart and go I'm Harrison Ford
48:16 [ __ ] I don't have to do this
48:18 stupid [ __ ] I'd rather just live off my
48:20 Star Wars money my Indiana Jones money I
48:22 don't have to do this crap enough to
48:23 compromise Who I am
48:24 to make some sicko and Aldi what happy
48:27 but then dinero's right there he's
48:29 always right there yeah sure whatever
48:32 and this guy's running up and talking
48:35 about a guy who's a real man who speaks
48:38 his own words right he doesn't speak
48:40 some words other people wrote for them
48:42 again you are what you eat so if you
48:44 allow these people into your
48:45 consciousness and you know if he's if
48:50 he's calling Trump this and that and
48:51 using f-bombs and you don't like Trump
48:54 for your own reasons and have nothing to
48:55 do with what I just said or even
48:57 anything that maybe dinero saying you're
48:58 just going to feel like god someone
49:00 finally said it
49:00 I had an exhaust port from my hatred and
49:04 it was the Tonys or some private message
49:07 that's uploaded on YouTube all I got to
49:10 say is be very careful with that because
49:12 what could that possibly teach your
49:14 brain how to do be negative and hate
49:17 things we all deal with things we don't
49:21 like right when were kids we learn the
49:24 word hate and then we start using it and
49:28 if we have decent parents our parents
49:30 say well you know hates a really strong
49:32 word you shouldn't use that word you
49:33 should find different ways to say it and
49:35 a lot of us will say well we dislike it
49:38 right
49:39 kind of plays with your mind a little
49:41 bit because you're trying to gauge the
49:42 amount of discontent you have with
49:44 something and hate is that ultimate word
49:46 it's the ten on the scale of dislike but
49:50 would you really want to get good at
49:52 that emotion because what could that do
49:55 to your life if you freely use a number
49:57 ten word for your dislike level then it
50:01 becomes simple how many of you struggle
50:03 with cursing well you get around you
50:06 know you get yourself kind of cleanse
50:07 you hang out with a bunch of good people
50:08 that don't cuss don't swear but then you
50:11 hang out with someone who swears a lot
50:12 and my god you start swearing like crazy
50:14 and it's like then you go back to your
50:16 good people and you start swearing in
50:17 front of them and then you go to bed at
50:18 night you're like oh my god I said the
50:21 f-bomb in front of so-and-so I can't
50:23 believe I did that
50:23 I may have permanently injured their
50:25 their perspective of me and I'm really
50:27 not like that as a full-time person but
50:30 damn well if you get really good at a
50:35 trip what are you gonna be good at
50:37 alienating everyone around you if you
50:41 get to a point of absolute regret as to
50:44 who you are as a human being and what
50:46 you've said inside here and you need to
50:50 dig yourself out of that problem you may
50:54 not be able to be a big enough human to
50:58 do it right you might go well I'm so
51:02 committed to this stuff and I told
51:03 everyone how bad Trump is and so I can't
51:05 ever get my head out of my ass in front
51:07 of my friends now inside a I kind of
51:09 turning a new leaf but I can't go back
51:11 to that restaurant of those people or my
51:13 friends and my family and ever say I
51:15 didn't have my information correct and I
51:18 now changed my opinion when you'll
51:21 probably find out if you did you would
51:23 be celebrated as more intelligent and
51:25 more courageous than those that stay in
51:29 it for the sake of staying in it right
51:31 the hatred is being portrayed in the
51:33 press both sides right the one little
51:37 Fox organization and the other five
51:40 liberal organizations they're all
51:42 pitching hate hate the left ate the
51:44 right hate hate 80 if the organization
51:47 doesn't have enough balls to say what
51:49 they are trying to portray they'll
51:51 simply put a dinner
51:52 on TV every five minutes that you hear
51:55 well it's not us doing it it's De Niro
51:57 doing it right what I don't like is that
52:04 there seems to be a growing group of the
52:06 population that is now hoping and
52:08 praying that America fails that the
52:10 world fails they'll put us straight into
52:14 an Orwellian globalist world simply so
52:17 that they don't have to be grownups they
52:20 can remain cowards and sit inside their
52:23 hate bubble they want the economy to
52:26 crash globally they want all peace talks
52:30 to go to hell they want to send a
52:32 nuclear holocaust they want your kids
52:36 murdered killed and raped by
52:38 organizations that move into your
52:39 country they want to destroy your future
52:45 and if you have children or children on
52:47 the way or you haven't had your kids yet
52:49 and you want to have them there trying
52:51 to make sure that the world that you're
52:52 going to grow up in and that your loved
52:54 ones are gonna grow up in is of the most
52:56 acidic nature so that they can not be
52:58 wronged their way of winning is to make
53:03 sure someone else loses I can't think of
53:05 anything more unintelligent than that
53:09 there's probably a time of my own
53:11 personal youth where I thought that was
53:13 the case and I think that the pivotal
53:15 moment for my brain is gonna sound silly
53:19 when Steve Jobs walked out I believe in
53:21 1997 and announced that Microsoft was
53:24 making 150 million dollar investment in
53:26 Apple and they committed to keeping the
53:28 Microsoft Office product on the Apple
53:30 platform everyone booed in the audience
53:33 and you know Bill Gates was on a remote
53:37 feed from wherever the hell he was in
53:39 the world and Steve just looked through
53:41 the whole audience and said and Steve
53:42 has been classically recorded as having
53:46 hatred well wherever the hell he went
53:49 from 1993 to 1997 when he disappeared he
53:53 had learned something that he brought to
53:57 all of us and he said we don't have to
54:01 have someone else fail for us to succeed
54:05 and then what happened to Apple they
54:09 vetted the iPod they reduced their 42
54:11 computers down to four to consumer to
54:14 pro they got their software together the
54:16 operating system together then they did
54:18 the iPhone right everyone hated that
54:21 little ceramic cube but that actually
54:23 fed all the miniaturization for the
54:24 iPhone and most of the components that
54:26 you find today in your computers
54:28 it was pure success until his death
54:32 sadly that was the death of his company
54:35 but let's learn from that moment it's 21
54:40 years ago that we can learn from that
54:44 moment if you are liberal and you made
54:48 it this far first of all you're an
54:50 amazing person I doubt anyone ever made
54:52 it this far if you're still in that camp
54:55 I want to reiterate what I said at the
54:58 beginning of this episode which is if
55:00 well I will say this you are being
55:02 entirely suckered by the hatred out of
55:05 the 5 press organizations that are on TV
55:07 I don't know how many countless
55:09 magazines echo all this sentiment and
55:11 contribute their own DNA into this
55:12 hatred but if you stay distracted in
55:15 hatred you will never develop a plan
55:19 that can turn into a political platform
55:21 you will never engage society and their
55:24 suffering to know what to do to get
55:28 their opinion to sway toward your
55:29 candidates and house the Senate or in
55:32 the presidency you will lose every
55:35 single day that you're stuck in hatred
55:37 you will and you're losing right now
55:39 you're losing right now we have two ads
55:43 that are playing on YouTube in
55:44 California every time I watch YouTube
55:46 there's a guy named Scott Baugh that is
55:50 running for I guess governor governor
55:52 toriel race or something he's running on
55:54 like five or six issues but everybody
55:56 cares about then there's a kind of a
55:59 nebulous Democrat one that is just
56:01 nothing it doesn't say anything it talks
56:03 about emotion I'm running for emotion
56:05 I'm looking for this and that it's
56:06 there's no policies in the whole ad it's
56:08 all emotion because they know that the
56:11 Democrats are strung out on nothing of
56:13 any substance hatred is hatred of policy
56:17 in politics
56:18 could you ever solve a problem in your
56:20 personal life by introducing hatred I
56:23 don't think so I think you can introduce
56:26 cancer into your body I don't think you
56:29 can do anything else with it the
56:31 interesting irony is that you have
56:33 diplomacy in the in the liberal eye is a
56:37 tool of the Liberals and war is the tool
56:39 of the right-wingers okay we just came
56:42 out of a president that kept seven
56:44 theatres of war going constantly so war
56:46 war war war leadership change raising
56:49 regime change in the assassination of a
56:51 leader that was covertly smuggled in as
56:55 them killing their own leader right so
56:57 our Special Forces went to Libya found
56:59 where Muammar Qaddafi was which wasn't
57:01 hard they captured him gave him to this
57:04 little group of people that were then
57:05 videoed on television sodomizing the guy
57:07 killing him sodomizing with a gun
57:10 so that's your liberal solution since
57:16 we've been in this new year and a half
57:18 of the right guy and again he's not
57:20 really a Republican he's really more of
57:23 a constitutionalist or magna carta do no
57:26 harm kind of guy we've got negotiations
57:30 and handshakes with North Korea we're
57:33 trying to deal with trade deficits up to
57:36 eight hundred billion dollars in this
57:38 country eight hundred fifty per year
57:40 with all of our partners that you know
57:43 we're allowed to do such a thing
57:45 so diplomacy diplomacy diplomacy sure
57:48 there's some pretty hot headed twit you
57:51 know tweets that go out but words don't
57:57 hurt you right sticks and stones do but
57:59 we had eight years of sticks and stones
58:01 in the name of the United States of
58:03 America being used all over the place
58:07 how many of you before all this 9/11
58:11 crap thought that maybe visiting the
58:15 Middle East would be fun you know some
58:17 places Cairo see the pyramids you can
58:21 still do these things but it's a lot
58:22 more hostile now you need a lot more
58:23 protection to do it if you go to Europe
58:26 now you got to not say you're American
58:30 even going to Canada I got a friend in
58:33 Canada right now and they were told you
58:36 may not want to say you're American as
58:39 if that could be concealed that's not
58:41 out of the last year and a half man
58:43 that's out of the last 16 years I wonder
58:47 throw in here too because it's not
58:49 enough to do an entire episode on but
58:51 one of the [ __ ] ways that they
58:53 are trying to again fix their problem
58:56 before they have to admit that they're
58:58 wrong is to remove the electoral college
59:01 in the United States of America for
59:02 those of you who aren't aware of what
59:03 that is it's essentially saying that
59:07 because there's so few people in the
59:09 center of America guys compared to the
59:12 coastal regions the electoral college
59:14 was developed to make sure that we take
59:16 care of the inland population with equal
59:20 representation as we do the coastal
59:22 regions if the electoral college is
59:26 erased then anyone who runs for
59:28 president is only going to campaign in I
59:31 don't know five to five to eight states
59:33 maybe only two maybe only in New York
59:36 State and California State because
59:38 that's where all the votes are gonna
59:39 come from that's where the population is
59:42 really really dense so imagine a
59:47 candidate for president doesn't have to
59:49 stomp in North Dakota South Dakota
59:52 Nebraska Kansas Oklahoma Colorado
59:57 Missouri Ohio Maryland all these states
60:03 barely represent anyone at all yet they
60:06 are a core part of the GDP in this
60:11 country the gross domestic product that
60:13 we create it's where a lot of people
60:16 locate their factories because they
60:19 don't have to pay a tremendous amount of
60:20 money to the workers because they don't
60:21 have a huge cost of living if that's
60:26 ever erased well that's just that's
60:27 that's erasing our democracy entirely
60:31 and then there's reality to the left
60:36 thinks that Los Angeles for example is
60:38 all blue the whole place is blue
60:41 Ventura County they think is blue if
60:45 there's one blue area maybe it's San
60:47 Francisco but when you get on the ground
60:51 and you talk to people right now 2018
60:54 and sitting in smoke lounges oh my god
60:57 it's the best best way because we don't
60:59 put a sign on the front of smoke lodges
61:01 that says if you're Republican come in
61:03 here and smoke cigars nope now maybe it
61:07 takes an alpha male to get to that point
61:09 where they're smoking cigars I don't
61:11 know I don't think that's the case but
61:15 if you've ever seen the elevators open
61:17 in the movie The Shining by Stephen King
61:19 / Stanley Kubrick this blood this red
61:23 blood comes into the corridor and
61:25 splashes everywhere the amount of red in
61:28 this country right now is growing every
61:31 day every single day because people are
61:35 sick and tired of the way it's been
61:38 again during the first eight years of
61:40 Bush we had this fake bubble in the
61:45 real-estate market people made a
61:47 tremendous amount of money we're also
61:48 distracted with this retaliation for
61:50 9/11 the neocons were in charge handed
61:54 the baton over to the left intentionally
61:58 via the bilderbergs right and then we
62:02 went into a socialistic death spiral
62:07 everyone on welfare right it was gonna
62:11 be government government government
62:13 handling everything and again you have
62:16 seen how the government handles things
62:18 health care in this country is a [ __ ]
62:20 it's in shambles okay anybody has ever
62:26 had to go through the court system
62:27 anyone has ever had to go to the DMV to
62:30 get your car registered now some of them
62:32 are okay again the people are fine but
62:35 they're being regulated by the
62:37 government and hired and untrained by
62:40 the government they could be made
62:41 geniuses right if the government cared
62:44 the every child left behind educational
62:49 system in America is a [ __ ] joke it's
62:52 to make sure that the dumbest kid in
62:54 class drags
62:55 the smartest kid in class unless your
62:56 kid goes off and takes advanced
62:57 placement classes good luck man good
63:02 luck hope your kids an artist a singer a
63:05 writer something that is not going to be
63:07 tracked by the school system at all
63:09 gonna be trained I think we have to kill
63:13 this problem it's probably a bad choice
63:17 of words but we have to figure out a way
63:19 to help those in a hatred mode come out
63:26 of their hatred give them a warm place
63:29 to to be tell them look we're not going
63:33 to sit around and call you names for
63:35 having got it all wrong
63:37 we're just going to accept you forget
63:40 the past
63:41 we understood why everyone got upset now
63:44 we're going to move forward but now
63:46 let's go back before we close to the
63:50 ocean analogy let's say you let a bunch
63:55 of people tell you what's going on in
63:56 the ocean and what all the policies mean
63:59 and who's a good person who's a bad
64:01 person who's a good country in a bad
64:02 country how the ocean even works and you
64:07 said okay I have been bitten by the
64:11 interest of making the oceans clean
64:12 again wonderful again plentiful and so I
64:17 am gonna change careers I'm gonna change
64:19 from what I do for a living to studying
64:20 the ocean working in the ocean when I
64:22 get a job somewhere in that realm maybe
64:25 you're lucky enough to be wealthy enough
64:26 just to simply say I'm going to retire
64:28 into this and we'll see what happens the
64:31 first thing you need to do in order to
64:33 get your information resources probably
64:37 take everything you've ever learned in
64:40 the first period of your life to get bit
64:42 by this and move it into the maybe
64:44 category maybe that's true we'll find
64:47 out
64:48 you're gonna have to pick some
64:50 discipline in the ocean what do you care
64:53 about you care about coral reefs do you
64:55 care about pollution you care about
64:57 whale harvesting dolphin harvesting the
65:01 nuclear radiation problem of a lot of
65:02 fish that we still eat and so you start
65:06 conducting experiments you get out there
65:09 you dive you get your own temperature
65:12 gauge system that you built yourself and
65:14 you test out some of these theories in
65:17 some of the shallower water where
65:18 there's all this alarm that it's really
65:19 really hot and you put your own
65:20 temperature gauge down there and you see
65:22 doesn't match the one that the
65:23 globalists are telling us this alarmist
65:26 thing well and if it comes back red hot
65:29 okay well does that really matter let's
65:31 go research that theory and you get in
65:33 there and you research it for yourself
65:35 you stop taking in data from other
65:36 people it's the exact same thing for
65:40 political alignment don't worry about
65:43 the left and don't worry about the right
65:45 the RNC and the DNC [ __ ] those guys
65:49 you're a human being and I'm a human
65:51 being and we have to figure out how this
65:52 world works we have to figure out a
65:53 balance right you can't watch TV number
65:59 one you can't read rags newspapers or
66:03 magazines at all you can't the one thing
66:08 you can do is take any one of the more
66:12 mathematical theories of how the world
66:14 works whether it be economics or crime
66:17 or something and you're gonna have to
66:20 get into the details of how it works and
66:22 be objective about it someone's telling
66:25 you how something works when you gotta
66:26 have to prove it to yourself it's a
66:28 difficult difficult thing to do which is
66:30 why most of us find ourselves extremely
66:33 challenged to becoming what we might
66:35 think is mildly qualified to have an
66:37 opinion in the first place but there's
66:40 some very interesting things that you
66:41 can do without having a PhD in something
66:45 you can simply look at the result of a
66:49 particular Theory being enacted in this
66:51 world what do I mean there's a theory of
66:54 a black hole that again as I always
66:57 lament on the show because I've heard
66:58 this a million times if your subscribers
67:01 the theory was debunked in the early 90s
67:04 late 80s using physics okay then it just
67:08 disappeared for 20 years and showed up
67:09 again it was like oh my god they're at
67:11 the center of everything right center of
67:12 the galaxy they're all over the universe
67:14 we've never seen one ever even though
67:18 they show you pictures of things and
67:20 they go that's a black hole it doesn't
67:21 have anything to do with what was
67:23 theorized to exist seeing a black disc
67:27 in space someplace where the star simply
67:29 just disappeared in a elliptical manner
67:33 or even a circular man if you happen to
67:34 look dead on the thing but if we ever
67:38 did see it see a star being sucked into
67:41 some tiny little black dot which has an
67:45 absence of stars behind it right then we
67:48 would have some visual indicators that
67:49 perhaps this thing really exists the way
67:54 that we've theorized it to exist I can
67:57 tell you since I've been alive I
68:01 wouldn't be able to hold up five fingers
68:04 if I were to tell you every law that I
68:05 think has been passed in my lifetime
68:07 that benefits me before I was born they
68:12 managed to handle a lot of the
68:14 segregation issues so that was before I
68:16 was born since I've been alive they've
68:19 introduced I think seatbelts that's been
68:23 one of the only laws that have been
68:24 passed that's really helped me out
68:25 personally as far as the Savings and
68:28 Loan scandal of Ronald Reagan or the
68:31 subprime loan scandal those things were
68:33 deregulated in my lifetime and then Rhee
68:35 regulated it's a little game they play
68:37 okay just look at the world the way it
68:41 has been and tell me that you think
68:43 we're going in the right direction
68:45 Europeans tell me tell me if when you go
68:48 outside and look at your country if you
68:52 think that you're winning I think it's
68:56 very obvious you're not some areas
68:58 you're screamingly winning but in terms
69:01 of the long term existence of your
69:03 country of your population you might say
69:06 race you are losing you have a choice
69:11 qoe says you have a choice
69:14 as to what you want to do maybe you want
69:16 maybe you think you've lived too long
69:17 maybe think your race is all evil
69:19 because you bought all this propaganda
69:21 about your [ __ ] you know about it your
69:22 history and so you feel you know you
69:25 feel guilty about your history and so
69:28 you think well we should go away I think
69:32 if you're a rational human being and you
69:34 look at the world globally but
69:36 especially if you're just a United
69:37 States citizen and you look at our
69:38 country we've been losing there's a
69:44 reason why there is record unemployment
69:45 in this country that now I think goes
69:47 back 40 some years in certain sectors
69:53 there's a reason why that's a record
69:55 because we have been climbing and
69:57 climbing and unemployment sending all of
70:00 our jobs overseas that's hopefully
70:04 coming to a close and hopefully we don't
70:05 lose the progress that we make over the
70:07 next what is it
70:09 three and a half years two and a half
70:10 years hopefully we get another four
70:12 years of that we'll see and if we do
70:15 change leaders that they don't lose the
70:18 vision because Americans won't put up
70:20 with it and again the template over here
70:22 is infecting a lot of Canadians it's
70:25 affecting a lot of Europeans and they're
70:27 like yeah we need a guy like Trump he's
70:31 flawed sure but Christ at least he's
70:33 getting [ __ ] done and he's actually
70:34 listening to the people and the benefits
70:37 to those people over there are going up
70:40 not down so whether you understand
70:43 politics at all you can measure it going
70:47 down any measure going up I would say
70:51 that we are beyond a shadow of a doubt
70:54 going in a positive direction
70:58 so I want to give you as a bonus to this
71:00 episode something I found out from a
71:04 brilliant attorney yesterday at a smoke
71:06 shop what a derivative is because I've
71:11 explained it a couple times but I think
71:12 that I took too many words to explain it
71:15 so I want to throw it out there for
71:16 those of you who have ever heard that we
71:17 have a derivatives bubble out there no
71:20 one knows how many derivatives have been
71:21 created therefore we don't know how at
71:24 risk we are in the world let me explain
71:26 this to you SuperDuper fast a derivative
71:30 is nothing more than a piece of paper
71:32 that agrees to ensure a individual or an
71:36 entity against a particular outcome when
71:41 the subprime loan scandal occurred and
71:44 it was a scandal let me tell you it was
71:46 deregulated by Clinton just before he
71:51 left office to open up the spigot for
71:56 this whole thing of course AIG is a
71:59 gigantic insurer in this world the
72:01 largest insurance company on the planet
72:03 as far as I am aware they had written
72:06 and created a derivative which is an
72:10 insurance policy for Goldman Sachs for
72:12 instance against all of these subprime
72:15 loans that were being issued as well as
72:17 all the prime real estate loans that
72:18 were issued I'm gonna tell you how both
72:21 these became corrupt because I was
72:23 confused previously in an episode of
72:25 made in first season well straighten
72:27 this out but first and foremost when
72:29 that went all tits up goldman sachs
72:32 owned a tremendous amount of debt a
72:35 bunch of belly-up loans they went to AIG
72:40 and said you secured this with a
72:43 derivative we need 30 billion dollars
72:47 right now to cover our ass you under
72:50 wrote it we need the cash and the AIG
72:52 said we don't have the money I mean we
72:55 don't the liquid cash we've got six
72:56 hundred billion plus in assets but we
72:58 don't have thirty billion in cash we can
73:00 give you and so that's where the big
73:04 spark happened and it exploded AIG had
73:08 to go the United States government to
73:09 borrow the
73:10 which is by the way been all paid back
73:13 with interests but when this was
73:16 deregulated and I was actually to
73:18 Obama's credit it was reregulate a--
73:20 dunder his administration and i think
73:22 within the first twelve months of him
73:24 being in office so kudos to him they
73:26 knew they had to do this because you
73:28 know it was all deregulated on purpose
73:30 and for those of you when i get on your
73:33 high horse a Democratic president
73:35 deregulated it so that it blew up on the
73:38 Republicans ticket and then it was
73:40 reregulate it by the next Democrat so
73:43 you know it's like me renting a house I
73:47 don't have the ability to pay the rent
73:49 and so I leave but I leave a bunch of
73:50 roaches behind so the next person who
73:52 gets in there has to deal with roaches
73:54 and they can't fix it or it doesn't get
73:56 really bad until the last year that
73:59 they're there and then the next person
74:00 moves in and their exterminator and they
74:02 kill it right so I'm not a good thing
74:04 that happened there but Bush let it be
74:08 unregulated so they're all in the same
74:10 team okay until now derivatives can be
74:16 created now they have to be regulated
74:18 but before it was any concept in your
74:21 mind that could be insured it could be a
74:24 derivative and I mean I could write you
74:26 a derivative if you stubbed your toe and
74:29 you could get a ten thousand dollar
74:30 payout if you stubbed your toe the
74:33 problem is is that there's not enough
74:35 money in the world to ever pay for all
74:37 of this insurance it's out there it's
74:39 all fake but the idea with AIG which was
74:44 explained to me beautifully was they did
74:45 the math and said well come on the whole
74:47 markets not going to go tits-up at once
74:49 that would be like providing fire
74:52 insurance to homes all over the world in
74:54 every house burning down on the same day
74:56 it doesn't happen so they did the math
74:58 and it works out on paper and so that's
75:01 why they wrote the derivative to goldman
75:04 sachs now one of the things i had
75:07 confused about the subprime loan scandal
75:09 was that i have family that worked for
75:12 the federal reserve to my dismay but
75:15 whatever they're not bad people just
75:17 more official story folks and when this
75:20 whole thing went tits up what i was told
75:21 was that as the federal reserve
75:24 audited all the banks with their loans
75:26 out of 100% of the loans in this
75:29 eight-year period only 8% of them were
75:31 subprime subprime means you can't verify
75:33 your income you just have a bunch of
75:36 anomalies that would normally make you
75:37 not have a loan of the 8% of subprime
75:41 loans only 8% which gets confusing
75:44 rights 8% of 8% really went belly-up in
75:46 terms of people not being able to pay
75:48 their mortgage now the gentleman I
75:52 talked to is very intimately
75:56 knowledgeable about the AIG situation I
76:00 said well because he said the prime
76:02 loans went went tits-up too and for
76:04 those of you to understand what that
76:05 means it would mean someone who's got
76:07 great credit tons of money in the bank a
76:09 really great income they couldn't secure
76:12 all kinds of money so if one were to be
76:16 in a prime real estate status you got
76:18 850 credit you've got a million dollars
76:21 a year in income and you go and you try
76:24 to borrow five hundred thousand dollars
76:26 to buy a house for instance the person
76:28 loaning you that money he goes well geez
76:30 with your income I could loan you five
76:32 million why don't you take five million
76:33 instead and you have to fight them and
76:36 say no I only want five hundred thousand
76:38 I'm not interested in getting in a bunch
76:39 of debt to you at some interest rate the
76:42 way that the prime loans went tits-up
76:44 was the following most people heard that
76:47 pitch from the bank and said really they
76:50 said yeah I loan you five million
76:52 dollars at 3%
76:54 you only need five hundred for your
76:56 house right so you got four point five
76:57 million dollars now you could run risk
77:00 and go travel the world with four point
77:02 five million dollars and never have to
77:04 work until you get done or you could
77:06 play the stock market or you could
77:09 invest in a bunch of startups or
77:11 whatever and a ton of people took
77:13 advantage of this situation and they
77:16 borrowed way more than they needed and
77:18 [ __ ] around with the money and lost it
77:21 and obviously they went tits-up on their
77:23 loan I mean think about it there are
77:27 people out there that that ceremoniously
77:29 bankrupt as fast as possible right every
77:32 ten years
77:32 they literally plan their life I'm gonna
77:36 behave for six years and then
77:38 about the seventh year I'm gonna start
77:39 spending a lot of money eight nine ten
77:41 boom
77:42 they just walk away from the dead
77:44 leaving us all holding the purse all of
77:48 our interest rates go up because they're
77:49 trying to pay off this guy's loan the
77:50 even won't pay that's what happened so
77:55 the reason why they say we have 800
77:58 trillion or a few quadrillion of
78:00 derivatives out there is because they
78:01 don't know for those eight years it
78:04 didn't get regulated and it wasn't
78:06 tracked so today in order to have a
78:09 secure derivative meaning any derivative
78:13 you have to report it to the financial
78:16 institutions of whatever country you're
78:18 in to make sure that you have the money
78:20 to back up your derivative so we don't
78:24 know for eight years it's it's out there
78:27 who knows what the terms are on some of
78:30 these derivatives hopefully they've all
78:31 expired but the majority of them expired
78:33 hopefully a lot of them don't get
78:35 created hopefully countries don't
78:37 deregulate it so that there's some
78:38 country out there that says well we're
78:41 allowing derivatives to be created
78:43 without oversight all you have to do is
78:48 start your business in that foreign
78:49 country and then you can do all kinds of
78:51 crazy [ __ ] around the world
78:52 well I'm insured by B F Egypt
78:55 derivatives incorporated but I could be
78:59 in America I could be in Germany I could
79:01 be anywhere in the world
79:03 derivatives bring down those who that
79:06 buy them not those that make them those
79:09 that make them simply walk away and go
79:11 that was funny I made a [ __ ] ton of
79:13 money off the premiums for that
79:14 derivative so I wanted you guys to have
79:18 that information in some form I figure
79:19 we're on the subject of politics and
79:21 policies might be a good place to drop
79:23 it I don't see this episode getting a
79:28 lot of views I don't again I don't like
79:30 making these kind of videos at all I
79:32 mean I seriously it was vastly between a
79:34 dream one and this one and it was like I
79:36 think this one's important but I think
79:39 you feel me
79:40 well I'm where the other if you have
79:43 them into deep thoughts radio calm
79:45 please go there's audio video a locked
79:48 Facebook page patreon and
79:50 currently a teeny tiny store and I think
79:52 most the items in the store have
79:53 actually expired so we'll get them back
79:55 out there soon enough anyway take care
79:58 of yourself and someone else and I'll
79:59 see in the next deep thoughts over now
