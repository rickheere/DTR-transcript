00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts today we're going to talk
00:39 about everything EMF electromagnetic
00:42 fields and we're gonna go through a deep
00:46 dive on pretty much all wireless
00:50 technology but overall the latest push
00:54 for 5g networks and there's a lot of
00:58 people freaking out over about 5g for
01:00 very good reasons but if you've bought a
01:03 home router in America in the last two
01:07 years you probably already have a 5g
01:09 network in your house bombarding your
01:11 body before we get into the absolute
01:15 technology of it all and the differences
01:17 of say 4G versus 5g and what's probably
01:21 coming after that we need to rewind here
01:26 rewind to a perspective by which we can
01:31 analyze the evolution a hundred and say
01:36 eighty years ago just beyond the
01:43 Telegraph technology electricity going
01:47 through wires of any kind we have earth
01:50 in it's almost pristine condition and in
01:53 that era the only thing you have to
01:55 pollute things would be factories which
01:58 in themselves were really just starting
02:01 to become something that we were
02:03 building in mass right trains that
02:08 barked out coal clouds
02:11 something very endearing about that
02:13 smell for a kid from a train town so
02:20 electromagnetic waves are something that
02:22 exists in nature and so you will hear
02:27 arguments all the time when man takes
02:30 something that ours already existed in
02:31 nature and then multiplies at times
02:33 exponential factors such as fluoride
02:38 naturally exists in tiny infinitesimal
02:41 amounts and say black tea leaves but the
02:45 amount that we synthetically put in
02:48 water and food and what-have-you is
02:50 millions of times more dense there's
02:54 that old saying you know just keep
02:57 everything in moderation you know
03:00 there's no moderation when man gets
03:02 ahold of something and turns it into a
03:04 profitable model electromagnetic waves
03:08 have sadly proliferated the world with
03:11 almost no regulation the gentlemen
03:15 Nikola Tesla who really was the first
03:19 commercial engineer of this technology
03:21 never lived long enough to see it come
03:24 into fruition within his lifetime and
03:26 especially not in a way that he could
03:28 have laid down some research to say this
03:31 is the way you can use it to not hurt
03:32 yourself and this is the way you can use
03:34 it to immediately get cancer and I have
03:39 to say for those of you like myself or a
03:41 big giant Tesla fans he wasn't a god
03:44 right he didn't have everything
03:47 researched he would sit in a room with
03:49 amazing lightning around his body and
03:51 there's the famous Paris World World's
03:56 Fair where apparently he encapsulated
03:59 himself in plasma energy and you know
04:04 just because it doesn't kill you right
04:06 away doesn't mean he wasn't exposing
04:08 himself to some form of early lethal
04:10 dose of electromagnetic energy perhaps
04:13 he had thought it through and he could
04:15 explain it to us to keep it from being
04:17 lethal but it is conclusive now
04:22 conclusive without the shadow of a doubt
04:24 that today's EMF transmissions are bad
04:27 for the human body on so many levels
04:30 that it's gonna take an hour to get
04:32 through a lot of their side effects as
04:35 well as explaining sort of where we
04:37 started with this whole thing so when
04:40 you want to talk about the dangers of
04:42 something you know there's there are
04:46 dangers of things like hey don't go into
04:48 the Canadian Hills unless you know about
04:51 black bears and grizzly bears and how to
04:53 survive the elements up there have been
04:56 there for as long as we've been there
04:58 and so those that's just a bunch of
05:01 lessons you have to learn to keep
05:02 yourself safe when it comes to today's
05:05 technology we have a differential what
05:10 was it before for you know countless
05:14 millennia millions of years and what
05:17 have we done as human beings recently
05:21 the last hundred fifty years the average
05:25 human body has eight Hertz of
05:28 electricity eight okay that means less
05:32 than ten all right your average 5g
05:36 router in your house is operating at 10
05:40 billion Hertz okay we're gonna get into
05:45 all the medical sort of atomic
05:48 understanding of why this messes with
05:50 your body because I don't hear that a
05:53 lot and I don't know why because it's
05:55 not that difficult for people to
05:56 understand sort of like they either the
05:59 person talking doesn't understand it or
06:00 they think you're an idiot
06:01 and hopefully neither is true the earth
06:06 during in a lightning storm if you were
06:10 too married measure the average Hertz
06:12 that you're experiencing I have read it
06:14 to be around 32 Hertz it's about 4 X of
06:20 the human body and that's during a real
06:22 exacerbated moment the Hertz of the
06:26 earth on an average day below 8 Hertz if
06:30 you're just in a nice quiet area
06:32 especially with a lot of water
06:34 there's no storms going on there's no
06:36 volcanic eruptions go
06:37 on and on top of a aqua ravine like the
06:42 Egyptians used to build their pyramids
06:44 on top of you hear me say the word
06:47 ecosystem a lot on this show almost at
06:49 nausea right and that is because in my
06:54 brain I think it's becoming a more
06:56 popular word for me to discern what's
07:01 going on and what we are doing here
07:04 health is keeping an ecosystem healthy
07:08 right when you get up in the morning and
07:11 you shower and you eat and you go to
07:13 work and you do your day and you come
07:15 home and you take care of whatever
07:16 responsibilities you have and then you
07:19 get tired and you go to bed and it
07:20 repeats
07:21 that's your ecosystem of your life and
07:23 the more you base it on tried and true
07:25 techniques the less you have any strife
07:28 in your life and you get everything that
07:30 you want in the ecosystem of of the
07:33 earth we're talking about an ecosystem
07:34 of survivability you know we know that
07:39 killing every fish in the ocean would
07:41 disrupt the food chain from mankind and
07:44 probably kill us off we killed all the
07:46 bees off and then will die eventually
07:48 cuz nothing pollinates which means all
07:50 the vegetables that we want to eat in
07:51 the world never create themselves the
07:53 animals that eat the vegetables that we
07:55 like to eat their meat don't they die
07:57 off and so the whole thing is this
07:59 horrible chain reaction and so the EMF
08:03 problem penetrates absolutely every
08:08 element of life on earth and that's
08:11 something I need to inject into your
08:12 brain here the first EMF examples that
08:18 we have are radio transmitting waves of
08:23 sound and a second medium that is then
08:27 retranslated translated back to the
08:29 original medium and then we recreate the
08:33 the original voice right so I speak I
08:37 vibrate air it hits a bladder inside of
08:39 a microphone like this it goes up
08:42 through the wires as a vibration and
08:43 gets recorded as a vibration that gets
08:46 sent to the other side via another
08:48 carrier wave right gets translated back
08:50 and then
08:51 vibrates the bladder and his speaker and
08:54 it goes back and forth the first
08:56 telephone calls right but most of you
08:59 understand that right
09:01 the big thing that we have to get over
09:06 and to gain perspective how we're going
09:07 to have an opinion about this
09:08 conversation is if someone told you or
09:14 asked you the question do you like the
09:18 amenities of life that you have and you
09:20 say yeah totally and they say okay well
09:23 what if I told you that that amenity
09:25 that you like a lot is actually killing
09:27 you meaning whatever a lifespan you were
09:30 going to have it's gonna be shorter we
09:34 think about that and you have a choice
09:37 oh god really how much how many years am
09:40 I gonna lose um about 20 if it's random
09:43 you know you could lose 40 just depends
09:45 on how much you get how much you use it
09:48 how allergic you are to it how healthy
09:50 you eat to help your body repair the
09:52 damage you know it's a crapshoot and
09:56 you're like God okay
09:58 people who smoke cigarettes they're
10:01 inhaling paper then a bunch of bunch of
10:04 chemicals that act as preservatives they
10:06 use a filter on the end which is made of
10:11 various levels of you know glass and
10:14 insulation they're making a choice and
10:17 they know they are any time you put
10:20 chemistry in your body I put this
10:21 tobacco loosely in the saliva in my
10:24 mouth and it displaces other things that
10:25 should be there that's where you start
10:29 getting you start rolling the die with
10:31 your life right
10:33 EMF waves have created amazing luxuries
10:38 in this world especially in the form of
10:40 social communication all of our cell
10:44 phones use it our radios use it although
10:46 I think radios as dead as it could be
10:49 right I think newspapers in radio are
10:51 sort of in the same camp together think
10:55 about how many things in your house are
10:56 now wireless printers or Wireless
11:00 computers are wireless cell phones your
11:03 fire sticks from Amazon or wire
11:06 you can't you know you can actually plug
11:09 in a lot of things to have direct
11:13 etheric Ethernet connections to the
11:16 outside world you can turn off all of
11:18 your networking in your routers which
11:20 we're going to talk about but then you
11:23 have all these clunky wires all over
11:24 your house and certain devices like a
11:26 fire stick don't have choices a lot of
11:30 companies are saving money by not
11:31 putting ethernet cards inside their
11:35 devices one it allows them to
11:36 miniaturize the device into it just
11:38 reduces the expense by five bucks or so
11:42 okay you know when radio was first
11:47 invented you know you had a.m. waves and
11:51 they were operating at such power levels
11:55 that you could listen to New York radio
11:58 in London and vice versa and then the
12:01 FCC the Federal Communications
12:05 Commission I guess is Moscow they they
12:10 started in brokering frequency ranges
12:13 right and for those of you who don't
12:15 know what that means it just means that
12:18 when you were to tune your radio they
12:21 sell every single piece of real estate
12:23 within the frequency range that they
12:25 have so a.m. sells it in the low bands
12:27 FM sells it in the high bands now the
12:30 human body runs on electricity obviously
12:33 we always talk about the matrix
12:34 reference where someone figured that out
12:36 and create are burning a little piece of
12:38 science fiction around it we don't
12:41 create a lot we've created enough a
12:43 little bit to keep us going we talk
12:46 about the electric electric illegals in
12:48 our bodies keeps us going
12:51 just the minut level of electricity that
12:54 we harvest is the difference in keeping
12:57 us from being a purely mechanical device
13:00 but understanding how your body is is
13:04 held together and what makes a human
13:07 cell procreate because there's two
13:09 different types of cells you have your
13:10 neuron cells in your brain and you have
13:12 all your little suitcase cells that are
13:14 doing the mitosis dividing that you
13:16 always see on the microscope
13:18 understanding your chromosomes I
13:20 understand that it's 50% approx protein
13:24 patterns and 50% double helix nucleic
13:27 acid chains as long as you understand
13:30 those basic pieces and we're gonna go
13:32 through a full review so you understand
13:34 how this stuff is actually really
13:36 affecting you because it's one thing to
13:37 come into your buddies and your family
13:39 go you know the 5g thing is absolutely
13:42 insane they're like what are you talking
13:44 about what do you know about this kind
13:46 of stuff and if you listen to me it'll
13:48 allow you to laser focus your minimum
13:51 amount of time to research this stuff
13:52 and you'll your brain will just pop if
13:54 you haven't heard of this stuff now
13:56 though just a little bit of background
13:59 on myself outside of being a very
14:02 inquisitive guy in general my physics
14:04 teachers wife died of cancer and what
14:09 that did was that caused him to
14:12 cannibalize my physics class with him
14:16 and my radio or does it no sound waves
14:19 in astronomy class that took from him
14:23 and he always talked about how radiation
14:27 affects the human body and he would
14:31 dispel myths it was really funny we had
14:32 tanning booths in town and tanning
14:36 booths are always especially back in the
14:38 80s there's still people to hang on to
14:40 these sort of false rumors about the
14:43 machines and that they said you know hey
14:45 this causes cancer and of course
14:47 dermatology was popping out of the late
14:48 70s early 80s where they were
14:50 essentially inventing reasons why you
14:52 needed to use them and you know it's
14:55 still just a complete charade to this
14:56 day but we'll get into it in a different
14:58 episode but he would he would literally
15:02 put up all of the light spectrum he put
15:05 me draw a line on the board and put up
15:07 all the light spectrums of sunlight and
15:09 devices x-rays and where these tanning
15:11 beds would go and he proved to you on on
15:13 a board he's like look there's no major
15:16 problem he says you know just don't go
15:18 eight hours a day
15:21 but what that what he did was he and he
15:24 taught me how variation affects DNA he
15:30 taught us how nuclear fallout if you
15:32 have an isotope that is floating through
15:33 the air and you ingest it how it it
15:36 finds its way into some of your more
15:38 nooks and crannies where iodine can also
15:41 fill up those nooks and crannies and be
15:43 a benign substance you know when you
15:45 take iodine you block radioactive
15:48 isotopes from taking root in your body
15:51 right we bummer is you have to take it
15:55 every day there's an isotope gets in you
15:58 and it's pretty much in there for the
15:59 rest of your life but what's interesting
16:01 other than the Sun okay which has its
16:04 own properties which is 99.9% good for
16:08 you right I get out here you can see the
16:10 Sun on my head the Sun right now is
16:11 penetrating my skull and it's got my
16:14 pituitary gland creating vitamin D which
16:16 is going to keep me much more healthy
16:18 than if I sat inside all the day because
16:20 it's cold outside in Russia they in the
16:24 northern hemisphere of Russia they
16:26 actually take little kids and expose
16:28 them to tanning machines to simulate the
16:32 frequency of light that makes the
16:33 pituitary gland go go fire and so these
16:38 kids don't get jaundice you know get
16:40 yellow and get sick in general but you
16:45 have the Sun and then you have this
16:47 bizarre thing which is sort of nuclear
16:49 fallout and again we all debate whether
16:53 or not the nuclear bombs existed I do
16:54 want to say and I'm not sure I got this
16:57 out of my do nuclear bombs exist or
17:01 atomic bombs I have the guy that the kid
17:05 that actually brought me to California
17:07 at 17 years old because he lived right
17:09 here right in this area
17:10 his father witnessed you know nuclear
17:15 bombs being blown up in bikini island
17:17 and so you know have a like at least I
17:22 had he's passed away now a first degree
17:24 contact of a man who watched several and
17:27 go off you know whether it was a Tomic
17:29 or whether or not it was just some crazy
17:32 dynamite ship I don't know
17:34 but with EMF we have a completely of a
17:37 third category of radiation it's a
17:43 man-made product it's now broadcast into
17:48 the atmosphere and what's interesting
17:49 about it is you know if I smoke this
17:54 cigar in my backyard and you're not
17:56 within 20 feet of me this will even make
17:58 it 100 feet of me there's a radius here
18:00 and you're completely safe by the time
18:02 this particulate diffuses into the
18:05 atmosphere one the smoke tends to go up
18:08 and so it's over your head by the time
18:11 you would ever ingest it within a
18:12 hundred feet but it's sort of a
18:15 proprietary thing I'm hurting myself if
18:17 I'm hurting anyone at all okay however
18:22 if I were to take a toxic barrel of some
18:26 horrible substance and put it on this
18:27 back patio and pull the top off a 50
18:29 gallon burial barrel and this stuff is
18:31 heavier than air and it starts just
18:33 seeping out to the neighborhood and
18:35 everyone starts passing out and feeling
18:36 strange and hallucinating and ex-fix
18:39 eating let's just say it's a good
18:42 monsanto cyclone being here then I am
18:46 hurting everyone else and I go to jail
18:49 so there's legal precedents for someone
18:52 removing your sovereign ability to stay
18:55 healthy an EMF wave transmission no
18:58 matter how you slice it and dice it is
19:01 an invasion of your health and we know
19:06 that you know that they what they do is
19:08 they measure how lethal it is because at
19:11 all you know once something occurs from
19:14 a individual to individual whether it be
19:17 a corporation to an individual whereby
19:19 any part of your body is injured
19:22 it's interesting how typically there's a
19:26 law that protects it right battery
19:29 assault as you run your mouth with
19:31 intent to hurt battery is the engagement
19:34 of the actual physical conflict and both
19:36 are governed by laws that way you if you
19:41 put laws on assault then you start to to
19:45 reduce the the smoke that turns into the
19:48 that is the battery right but what
19:52 happens with new technology is one
19:55 initially were stupid you know I don't
19:59 know about the cigarette industry and
20:02 how they are when they first understood
20:04 that it was naturally not very good for
20:05 you and again I think maybe early
20:08 cigarettes were made out of pure tobacco
20:09 a little white wrapper on the outside
20:12 luckily cigars have survived in being
20:15 purely tobacco objects and we don't
20:17 inhale we taste but the FCC that has
20:23 been formed to govern transmissions both
20:27 the content in the transmission and the
20:29 methodology of the transmission as I've
20:33 been told they do not employ doctors of
20:35 any kind any of the physical standards
20:38 that they profess I've been given to
20:40 them by the corporation's that invented
20:42 the technology in the first place which
20:43 means they're never going to tell you
20:45 that there's any reason why they should
20:46 make trillions of dollars off the
20:49 technology so we're not protected by
20:52 these organizations the FDA maybe during
20:55 Trump's administration will get a little
20:57 bit better but the FDA is bought off by
20:58 the food and drug pharmacy companies you
21:01 know they are there to make the public
21:05 feel comfortable with whatever the big
21:07 corporations are selling the EPA they
21:12 don't protect us they don't protect us
21:14 the only thing that they want to do is
21:15 for a bit you know outrageous problems
21:19 in health issues right they used to be
21:22 good and now they got corrupted the best
21:26 way to understand EMF is to think of a
21:28 bullet splicing something in half and
21:31 this is how nuclear radiation hurts you
21:35 and this is how Sun radiation can hurt
21:38 you okay and again for those of you who
21:41 believe that being in the Sun is bad for
21:43 you you know there's some sub ridges we
21:48 can sell you there's some was a tough
21:52 sell we can sell you a nice but the
21:56 extreme of all things is bad for you the
22:00 way that this these
22:02 waves of energy travel it's through the
22:05 utter shock and oscillation of the ether
22:09 winds that exist in the world okay
22:13 there's a medium that carries all things
22:16 and again gotta be careful getting into
22:20 Einstein the the wife-beater plagiarist
22:24 who said there is no medium known as
22:27 ether
22:27 you gotta for that reason alone just
22:29 don't listen to the guy okay undo all
22:32 the stuff you've ever learned from that
22:33 dude it's all mathematical conception
22:36 stuff and not reality
22:38 okay the stuff that he has accurately
22:41 predicted is based on a reclassification
22:43 of ether roll particles just so you know
22:46 so it's not that he didn't plagiarize a
22:49 bunch of people in Europe these Arian
22:51 Germans and French people who invented
22:54 everything that he invented okay and
22:57 then he just denied their patents and
22:58 then stole it and republished it right
23:00 so what we're gonna we're gonna
23:03 absolutely skewer and barbecue Einstein
23:07 before this season's over but there is
23:09 so much corruption about that guy that
23:11 I'm gonna have to create a cheat sheet
23:13 and I've only used that twice in any of
23:15 the 250 episodes so I'm gonna have to
23:17 post it right here in front of me like a
23:19 teleprompter to keep track of the dozens
23:22 of things that are so screwed up with
23:25 this guy but back to our show when these
23:30 waves of energy are transmitted from
23:33 point A to point B there's a frequency
23:36 which means a sine cosine wave we
23:40 measure those frequencies and length
23:42 okay for instance those of you who are a
23:45 little bit older who used to listen to
23:46 AM versus fm and you have to travel
23:50 through a tunnel there's a EM wave can
23:53 go into a tunnel and bounce around a lot
23:56 better than an FM wave FM wave you
23:59 listening to k-rock here in LA you go
24:01 through a Pasadena tunnel and boom it's
24:03 gone come out the other side it's there
24:06 you listen to some of these Latin radio
24:09 stations you go right through the tunnel
24:11 and they'll get a little fuzzy directly
24:13 in the center but then you come out and
24:15 it's okay and you never
24:16 lose complete earshot of the song it's
24:19 interesting because of the length of the
24:21 wave all of these generations of
24:24 technologies are increasing the
24:27 frequency of the waves and this creates
24:31 more gigahertz that our bodies then have
24:35 to tolerate and repair from okay
24:38 the major low-hanging fruit hurdle of
24:43 any EMF wave to the human body goes as
24:48 follows there's more to it but your
24:51 double helixes those little ladders that
24:54 twist inside your chromosomes which
24:56 again are half of what is in there they
24:59 can be broken and they usually call it
25:03 they usually categorize it as a single
25:05 or double splitting toxicity which means
25:09 the following if you were to take a DNA
25:14 strand and you break it in half okay
25:18 because you shot it with the bullet sort
25:20 of a photon reaction from the Sun an
25:23 electromagnetic wave from a broadcast
25:25 station or your cell phone or you have a
25:29 radioactive isotope in your body and it
25:32 is emitting it's so heavy it's you know
25:35 it's over 230 atomic weight and you
25:39 can't hang on to its its electron cloud
25:41 because it's so complex it's just
25:43 banging into each other and say knock a
25:45 little Ektron out here and electron out
25:46 there it starts penetrating your cells
25:49 it goes through the wall it goes into
25:51 this nucleus and it hits the chromosomes
25:53 and it hits the DNA and hits the nucleic
25:56 acid chain most the time because nucleic
25:59 acid chains are brilliant right certain
26:02 letters cannot connect to other letters
26:03 all right and so it can reconnect most
26:07 the time and if it if it doesn't
26:12 reconnect what ends up happening is the
26:14 immune system comes and it goes
26:15 oh we'll get rid of that guy because
26:17 he's not a complete cell be some weird
26:20 broken thing and boom your cell collects
26:24 waste just like a human body and
26:26 excretes it and then it repairs because
26:29 it has the pro
26:29 patterns on the other side of the
26:31 chromosome telling it that when you need
26:33 to put the you know the chains back
26:36 together create a new one split and so
26:39 the DNA splits into two rnas and then
26:42 synthetically it completes the nucleic
26:45 acids on the other side of the RNA and
26:46 you have two letters instead of one
26:48 that's how you procreate okay
26:50 neurological cells are different that is
26:53 the basis for why this stuff starts
26:55 causing us problems the closer you are
26:58 to electromagnetic field and you need to
27:02 understand that cell phones are these
27:05 devices the big power lines that are
27:08 above your house are these sources radio
27:12 is a source cell phone towers much more
27:16 intense source your wireless routers in
27:19 your house or a source the wireless
27:21 cards and your computers are a source
27:23 the power supplies in your laptops that
27:25 sit on your lap are a source and so this
27:32 is where we get it we have the the smart
27:34 meters I have one right there about ten
27:36 feet from where I'm sitting twice a day
27:39 that device broadcasts back to the
27:42 network how much electricity I've used
27:44 today okay it's an amazing thing to
27:49 think about the difference between today
27:52 and what it was like again about 180
27:54 years ago I say 180 because that gets
27:56 rid of everything we were sitting in a
27:59 world with approximately anywhere from 8
28:02 Hertz to 35 Hertz no more than that
28:07 maybe if we got hit by a lightning bolt
28:09 it was much different but a save that
28:12 weird experience we lived in almost no
28:16 natural radiation of any kind save the
28:20 Sun right which is not operating in
28:22 billions of Hertz and now what we have
28:25 done is shamelessly polluted our
28:29 airwaves with amazing levels and you
28:32 know what I had just named off in terms
28:34 of devices is what you are aware of you
28:38 know there's this over use of the device
28:42 HAARP
28:43 which is this crazy antenna that the
28:45 military uses to do all kinds of wild
28:47 eye on ionosphere experiments and hey
28:51 they could be nailing Los Angeles with a
28:53 death ray they could and it's not like
28:57 everyone fries immediately it's just wow
28:59 those people are gonna die in ten years
29:02 but what's going to happen with 5g is
29:04 going to be
29:05 mind-blowing okay absolutely
29:08 mind-blowing but we're gonna have to
29:11 make a decision about the amenities of
29:14 life versus the value of life if someone
29:19 took away your cell phone and said these
29:22 things are deadly we don't want you to
29:23 have one and we're no longer going to
29:27 allow the sale of a wireless router for
29:30 your house and because we don't have any
29:32 cell phones we don't need cell towers
29:34 we're getting rid of those too how badly
29:38 is that gonna impact your life really I
29:41 grew up and the Golden Age of America at
29:45 least the last stage of it with none of
29:48 that stuff
29:48 none of that stuff at all there was no
29:51 wireless anything the only thing we had
29:53 was radio FM and AM that was about it
29:56 the military has radar but usually radar
29:59 is broadcast in a very specific
30:01 direction and so unless you're flying
30:04 and a war you're not going to give any
30:07 of that stuff when you get into a plane
30:09 you do go up into the atmosphere enough
30:12 35,000 feet plus and you lose a lot of
30:15 the natural protection of the atmosphere
30:16 and so you do get a radiated like I
30:18 always say and again I've been told it
30:20 flying from Los Angeles to Dallas are
30:24 starting at Nellis what guess Dallas -
30:25 well Denver Colorado was an example I
30:28 heard you get basically the same amount
30:30 of exposure that you would get in a
30:33 chest x-ray and there's a limited number
30:36 of checks wrist x-rays you're supposed
30:37 to ever get in your lifetime unless you
30:40 die of cancer your body can repair from
30:44 cancer so go see my episode on cancer if
30:46 you want to detoxify yourself go see the
30:49 episode on toxicity or toxins to get
30:51 yourself detoxed and you can see our
30:53 episode to get yourself repaired it
30:55 doesn't matter if you have cancer I mean
30:56 everyone has
30:57 cancerous cell okay so you do both those
31:00 your brains gonna get better your health
31:02 is gonna get better you will extend your
31:04 life all right but the Internet has
31:07 given us the sense that we have to have
31:08 these things well I have to be able to
31:11 post a picture myself to somehow prove
31:13 to the world that doesn't give a [ __ ]
31:15 whether I live or die that I have I'm
31:20 living a better life than they are even
31:22 though I'm not and the reason why I want
31:23 to post that is because I'm actually
31:24 really not enjoying my life in most
31:27 cases right you want 500 virtual friends
31:31 instead of five real friends and this is
31:34 what we're fighting for we're fighting
31:35 to keep this crap this swill that does
31:38 nothing more than degradation each other
31:41 when we actually meet a real human being
31:43 in real life if you're an expert poster
31:46 you're the most witty reply er on any of
31:50 the social media elements you're able to
31:52 take a photograph to make yourself look
31:54 like you live on a different planet of
31:56 pure bliss but it's all a facade and you
32:01 meet someone in real life and you're
32:02 like you can't talk to them because you
32:04 don't know how to because you never
32:05 developed any skills in reality this is
32:08 what we're fighting for the virtual
32:11 proliferation of BS I know there's a lot
32:16 of you interested in what what's going
32:18 to be happening with 5g I will say to
32:21 you that again most of us have a 5g
32:23 router in America in our house so you're
32:26 already being exposed to 5g but what's
32:28 going to take place is sort of a million
32:32 x exposure to 5g now there are varying
32:38 levels of services the LTE the LTA
32:42 4G stuff okay as I have researched it
32:47 most of the carriers cellphone carriers
32:49 that are creating this this craziness
32:52 are sort of lying about how much data
32:56 you actually have access to there's
32:58 these theoretical scientific experiments
33:01 that say oh this new technology goes
33:03 this fast doesn't really matter what the
33:07 real numbers are because you are being
33:09 exposed to it whether or not your device
33:11 smart enough to grab the data you're
33:13 still being broadcast at all day long
33:18 here are some of the illnesses that you
33:21 get off being exposed to EMF waves
33:26 leukemia as being one of the most major
33:29 sources of illness based on EMF exposure
33:33 there's a big giant antenna in San
33:35 Francisco it looks like a the largest
33:38 power tower you've ever seen in your
33:40 life and the rates as I've had it
33:43 communicated to me by a scientist who is
33:46 an EMF expert who's also biologist he
33:50 said that the the amount of leukemia of
33:53 the residents by this tower is 93 times
33:56 higher at the base than normal people
34:00 who live out in Montana and the
34:03 interesting thing is the radius away
34:05 from this tower it reduces exponentially
34:08 the further away you are from this tower
34:11 and yet to California the big you know
34:15 liberal state that's trying to make sure
34:17 no one's feelings are hurt look
34:19 completely the other way while these
34:21 people are dying 10 20 30 years before
34:24 they're supposed to and children and
34:26 elderly people are the two most
34:28 susceptible human age ranges to die from
34:32 this because a child's immune system
34:34 isn't as as intense as it could be it's
34:37 just the volume of you know cells in
34:40 your body your white cells your t-cells
34:41 that will fight and repair things so
34:43 when you're teeny tiny you have less
34:45 repair coming into a particular unified
34:48 force of energy right so the tower is
34:50 not giving the child less energy I mean
34:52 yes they are smaller target
34:54 so getting the same amount of exposure
34:56 per capita as an adult but they don't
34:59 have the strength to to fight it elderly
35:01 people it's the inverse they're dying
35:03 they're slowly getting to the end of
35:05 their life and so they're dying before
35:06 their time you have to understand the
35:09 globalist of this world
35:11 toast champagne to these statistics oh
35:14 my god we are stopping the fertility of
35:17 human beings and we are killing their
35:19 their their newborns as soon as possible
35:22 and we don't want smart
35:24 to exist so I love the fact this is like
35:27 David Rockefeller kind of talking they
35:29 love the fact that Silicon Valley's got
35:31 a record level of autism due to these
35:34 this pseudo intellectual devotion to I'm
35:38 gonna make sure my kid has no problems
35:39 vaccinations immunizations get the shots
35:44 right but they're the first early
35:46 adopters to all this EMF technology as
35:49 well the second thing is just pure
35:51 fertility problems a lot of young men
35:55 put the cellphones either on their hips
35:57 or in their pockets and when they do
35:59 that the their testes their testicles
36:03 are very close to this EMF wave the EMF
36:06 waves penetrate the complex DNA of a
36:09 testicle and kill the sperm and it's
36:14 been tested several times you get a
36:17 young man that has had no exposure to
36:20 EMF and his testicle range they take a
36:22 sperm sample high sperm count I put a
36:26 phone in his pocket for a day then take
36:28 the sperm count even an hour and it is
36:31 it has fatalities in the sperm count as
36:35 well as a lower sperm count because the
36:37 body's being attacked in that area and
36:39 so instead of creating sperm it's
36:41 repairing this these damaged cells it's
36:44 horrible been proven several times okay
36:48 women put in their pockets right over
36:50 their ovaries the pocket is over the
36:53 ovary okay so the eggs that you have
36:56 been born with like a men a man could
36:59 have corrupted testicles and if he gets
37:03 the cellphone out of his pocket you can
37:06 repair over time and you can probably
37:09 have pretty clean DNA a woman a woman
37:12 who has her eggs when she is born if
37:14 those get corrupted then your child is
37:18 gonna be corrupted Down syndrome
37:20 stillbirths deformities mental
37:24 impairment the list is really infinite
37:28 women love the idea of putting the cell
37:32 phone in their bra men don't have bras
37:34 and so we don't put them by our breasts
37:37 if a man does do that
37:38 they get so so their cancer the idea is
37:41 and it's sort of a play on words the
37:43 cell phone creates cellular cancer the
37:45 cellular service resell your cancer how
37:47 ironic
37:47 I have a friend of mine whose wife died
37:50 from keeping her cell phone in her chest
37:54 on our left breast and that's exactly
37:56 where she got the corrupted cells and
38:00 then the doctor blew it off on the
38:03 biopsy and one year later she had it
38:06 extremely malignant and it killed her he
38:09 lost his best friend of 38 years due to
38:13 cellphones Adam Young from MCA died of
38:17 the other cause which is the salivary
38:20 gland cancer that is in your jaw line so
38:23 if you put it up to your up to your head
38:25 what ends up happening is is that the
38:28 power supply trying to create the
38:30 electromagnetic wave around the phone
38:33 yes so the way this works is it's
38:34 creating a smooth wave around the phone
38:36 as the smooth wave bumps into the
38:38 cellular tower wave the smooth wave gets
38:42 disrupted in a frequency okay would be I
38:45 don't even know what the analogy would
38:47 be but it's it's just the wiggle is
38:49 acknowledged into a binary digital
38:53 stream and then it translates into a
38:55 phone call the further you are away from
38:58 cellular service your phone is told to
39:01 use more and more energy to create a
39:02 bigger Van Allen belt basically around
39:05 your phone and they can sense wiggle and
39:10 it's looking for the from the admission
39:12 of a wave to the absorption of the wave
39:14 when the absorption gets interrupted
39:17 that's where you get the digital binary
39:19 data right it's three bits on off
39:21 nothing it boils the mitochondria in
39:26 your cells so you know when you look at
39:28 a cell the little round little suitcase
39:29 with the nucleus in the center all the
39:31 stuff in the middle the kind of carrier
39:33 soup in the Middle's mitochondria when
39:36 that boils due to utter friction of
39:38 frequencies it starts to literally
39:41 agitate and rip apart the DNA that's
39:43 inside your cell you ever take a hot
39:47 coal and put it in water and you hear it
39:48 sizzle what you were hearing is the
39:52 blowing down of extremely fast-moving
39:54 atomic energy thermalization retards
39:57 back into ice you know it's become still
40:00 an inert salivary glands and all of the
40:04 glands in your body are complex human
40:07 tissue
40:08 they have very delicate apparatus that
40:11 that make the function of what they do
40:14 do what they do and so when you have you
40:18 know like you've had this before when
40:20 you've broken something in your house
40:22 the bigger and clunkier it is the more
40:25 you can just glue it back together a big
40:27 thick vase that breaks you could just
40:29 glue it back together as long as you
40:30 don't have too many what small tiny
40:32 pieces little shards but if you take a
40:35 Swiss watch open it up and hit it with
40:37 the hammer you know that your chance of
40:39 straightening out all the little
40:41 sprockets in there and springs and
40:43 dowels and stuff is going to be utterly
40:46 next to impossible well your glands are
40:49 the ultimate biological Swiss watch of
40:51 your body okay your pancreas being the
40:56 most complex one that I'm aware of which
40:57 is why when you get pancreatic cancer
40:59 you have a 96% of percent of dying 96%
41:03 chance of dying only 4% of people who
41:06 have pancreatic cancer can survive it's
41:08 usually due to catching it really really
41:10 early in the process there are you know
41:14 Central Intelligence and Intelligence
41:18 Agency weapons that they will feed you
41:21 an isotope somehow and your water supply
41:23 or they could radiate you with a device
41:26 it's from like the curb of your house
41:28 and you can hit your chest and it will
41:31 give you cancer in your various organs
41:34 and so very popular people like the
41:39 predator the president of Venezuela dies
41:42 of pancreatic cancer
41:43 Steve Jobs died of pancreatic cancer
41:45 around the time that he is saying he's
41:46 going to take down Google right well
41:49 Google is a very important entity not to
41:50 be taken down and so when the more he
41:53 ratcheted up the side is gonna use his
41:54 100 billion dollars at the time to sue
41:57 Google to get rid of the Android device
41:59 he all of a sudden dies of pancreatic
42:02 cancer but he's also was you know he had
42:05 it he
42:05 cured of it and then he died of it they
42:08 want you they're gonna get you okay
42:10 there's an epidemic in the United States
42:13 of America of vertigo vertigo started
42:18 about the time that we got these for G
42:21 and 5g routers in our houses I have a
42:24 very close friend of mine and a neighbor
42:26 who's suffering from vertigo out of thin
42:28 air
42:28 vertigo isn't something that you catch
42:30 all right it's not like it's like
42:33 catching whiplash you don't catch it but
42:37 it's oscillating the inner ear and
42:39 messing with the crystallization and the
42:42 alignment of the inner ear and some
42:43 people more susceptible to it than
42:45 others it's it's a horrible thing to
42:49 have because your your movement in this
42:52 world turns into nausea so if you're
42:55 suffering from some acute recently
42:57 acquired I would say over the last five
42:58 years vertigo you need to consider
43:01 turning off your wireless router
43:03 technology and then use your router as a
43:06 wire technology and wire up your house
43:08 and just see if that helps shut off your
43:10 cell phone at night put it in airplane
43:12 mode it still acts like an alarm clock
43:14 even though it's in the airplane mode
43:16 another thing that's popped up is that
43:19 we now have a millions tens of millions
43:22 of people strung out on sort of ritalin
43:26 drugs right
43:28 your prozac and xanax because they are
43:30 stressed out they have a hard time
43:32 maintaining thought and it's because
43:35 they are susceptible to electromagnetic
43:38 radiation the show better call Saul has
43:41 a fictional character the fact that
43:44 guy's name is Michael Keating he was in
43:47 spinal tap he was I was in Linney and
43:50 Squiggy he played Lenny back in the old
43:52 day he plays a fictional character who
43:54 is sort of paranoid about EMF waves and
43:57 he he he just cringes every time they
44:00 turned on anything electric and I you
44:05 know it's it's a very interesting
44:06 character he does a great job in it but
44:07 part of me thinks wow this is the
44:09 dumbing down or this is the demonization
44:11 of people who are actually suffering
44:13 from these diseases and you know this
44:17 goes way way back to the beginning of
44:18 the radio you
44:19 people reporting these kind of problems
44:21 a long time ago but they never they
44:23 didn't the scientists probably knew
44:25 exactly what it was that who designed
44:26 this stuff but they're paid off to
44:29 protect and not submit any paperwork on
44:31 this the amount of research that's gone
44:34 into what I'm telling you over the last
44:36 20 years is off the charts okay just
44:39 look it up
44:40 all right there's plenty of research in
44:42 Europe as globalist as they are they are
44:45 providing the empirical evidence of this
44:47 in Australia of all places has quite a
44:50 few scientists that are putting this
44:52 together
44:52 now before 5g got into the mix and
44:56 before even 4G got into the mix you know
45:00 those two technology is gonna make what
45:01 I'm about to say even more intense there
45:05 are scientists out there and again I did
45:06 not make this up in my backyard okay but
45:09 understanding a lot about neurology and
45:11 the basic physics of the mind and then
45:15 knowing enough about electronics to be
45:18 very useful in the industry the low
45:23 frequencies that we use to operate our
45:25 brains okay can be manipulated by cell
45:29 phone towers they can even be
45:31 manipulated technically speaking by
45:33 regular transmission towers but what is
45:36 the cell phone tower it's a more intense
45:38 more complex more isolated use of upper
45:42 band radio frequencies and you should
45:46 know that when UHF antennas were put on
45:49 homes in the 70s a lot of illnesses came
45:52 out of thin air a lot of people had
45:54 problems just just having television
45:56 broadcast to their house believe it or
45:57 not but there is a range of neurological
46:02 energy that the brain uses the towers
46:04 aren't allowed to operate at exactly
46:08 well I shouldn't say this they're not
46:10 pre-programmed to operate at the exact
46:13 range of the human mind but they have
46:14 the capability of being configured via
46:16 firmware and software to reach out to
46:20 the brain of a human being I've
46:23 mentioned this a couple times in
46:24 different shows many many years ago many
46:26 episodes ago feels like years so imagine
46:29 that they are going to create a 911 2.0
46:31 and they have
46:33 gathered twenty years of evidence of how
46:35 we discovered that it was an inside job
46:38 and now they're hedging all the bets and
46:40 all the risk assessment of us
46:42 discovering that the new ones gonna be
46:44 one and again look at all the massacres
46:46 that they've done that have just they've
46:48 just gotten worse at it in my opinion
46:49 but let's just say there's a separate
46:52 group putting a lot of money and time
46:53 into this and the little rogue groups
46:55 are doing the Vegas shootings and that
46:56 kind of stuff all right
46:57 the 9/11 is created to create terror
47:00 right well imagine that they could take
47:02 all the cellphone towers of various
47:05 highly dense populated regions and
47:07 create this terror frequency coming out
47:10 of cell phone towers what would be
47:13 interesting is that we lose a lot of
47:15 cell phone reception at the time because
47:16 these towers would be cannibalized for
47:18 this other frequency and then the phone
47:19 calls would start going down of which
47:21 they could blame on the notion that a
47:23 lot of people are making phone calls
47:24 that morning and so I couldn't get my
47:26 phone call to go through in Los Angeles
47:27 but I was terrified which is why I was
47:28 trying to make a phone call in the first
47:29 place let's say they want to Sasson ate
47:33 a very useful politician who is changing
47:36 the world from globalist to nationalists
47:39 protecting the citizens of his country
47:41 or her country and they want us to
47:44 accept it so they could broadcast an
47:46 obtuse emotion of sort of docile
47:49 happiness well guys she knew they were
47:52 gonna kill him or her you know was gonna
47:53 happen let's go to the movies yeah sure
47:56 so I think one of the biggest games that
47:59 they have played one of the biggest coos
48:00 they've done with cell phone towers is
48:02 to create a mind control technology and
48:05 again these aren't my words these are
48:06 the top scientists that create and
48:10 police EMF illnesses EMF technology they
48:16 have the degrees in Neurology they have
48:17 the degrees in electronics they are
48:19 cross pollinating their information
48:22 between the two groups and writing
48:23 papers on this okay just look up the
48:27 word study you know you look up anything
48:29 that you think EMF dangers Studies cell
48:32 phone tower mind control studies and you
48:35 will be shocked at the dozens of
48:37 research groups that have put together
48:39 dozens of papers this isn't hocus-pocus
48:43 this isn't in foil hat stuff
48:46 the one thing that I haven't researched
48:49 that I would love to have put in this
48:51 particular episode is the reason why
48:53 they move from analog cellphones to
48:56 digital cellphones when I got my first
48:59 cell phone I think it was 1994 the
49:03 digital phones were horrible and the
49:06 analog phones the flip phone Motorola
49:08 phone worked perfectly
49:09 I had a timing belt throw and my
49:14 Mitsubishi Eclipse in 1994 driving down
49:16 the 101 driving north on the 101 of the
49:18 Bay Area and of course it blew my engine
49:20 and I had to get towed luckily there's a
49:23 tow truck right there it pulled me over
49:24 the side of the road but I had to get
49:26 towed from there because this guy
49:27 couldn't stop and my digital phone
49:29 couldn't make the phone call my buddy
49:31 does this flip phone boom it works
49:32 perfectly so a lot of the the need to
49:36 upgrade the technology seems to be
49:39 ridiculous because Motorola had it down
49:42 pat the the analog first digital or
49:44 sorry first cell phones
49:46 made phone calls perfectly they never
49:48 dropped there's a lot of shenanigans
49:50 with charging you for roaming and also
49:52 their BS right when they tell you
49:54 something you know cost a lot and a
49:56 digital realm like oh we're gonna charge
49:58 you for the bandwidth of your cell phone
50:00 or for your excuse me your internet
50:02 service in your house it's all
50:03 hocus-pocus it's just making up this
50:05 perception they're actually spending
50:07 more money on their side to transmit
50:08 your data it's complete crap you know
50:12 your average power line if if not hit by
50:15 a plane or something or a car hit in the
50:17 pole or whatever it would probably last
50:20 you know two or three hundred years
50:22 without needing to be replaced because
50:24 there's super thick wires they have no
50:26 problem keeping their conductivity
50:28 active and so again it's a joke there's
50:33 no need to in this particular episode to
50:35 review three G because 3G is gone it
50:38 exists as a absolute throwback
50:40 technology so we are sitting in sort of
50:43 a wide range of 4G services and again
50:48 depending on where you live you could
50:49 get 3G 3G quality of data transmission
50:52 rates and you can get almost up to like
50:56 the rumor can get up to about 4.5 G
51:00 you know closer to the five keys but
51:04 what is happening between the 4G and the
51:06 5g is a 10 X to 100 X multiplication of
51:12 data transmitted rates and you know I'm
51:16 sure there's some some geekier guys like
51:18 me listening who want to get in all the
51:20 bit rates and all that kind of stuff
51:22 it's really unimportant in this episode
51:24 we're really gonna be talking about the
51:26 the pollution of your body with the
51:28 electromagnetic frequencies that are
51:30 coming at you now I will say in the 90s
51:35 for those of you who remember the old
51:37 monitors that we bought back in the day
51:39 if you wanted a 20-inch monitor which
51:42 was a 4 by 3 ratio it weighed 60 pounds
51:47 and the reason why it weighs 60 pounds
51:49 was twofold you had your old CRT screen
51:53 in there which is made of very thick
51:54 glass with a gigantic copper wire
51:57 capacitor on the back that it fueled and
52:00 capacitated the electrons necessary to
52:03 get a phosphate you know laser to fire
52:05 to create the screen that you're saying
52:07 and all the pixels glowed in this nice
52:09 furry kind of star format they weren't
52:11 square and then they had to put a SAR an
52:17 RF a radiofrequency shield around it
52:20 which was a big metal case inside the
52:23 plastic case that you saw so that
52:25 contributed to the overall weight
52:26 because we had fairly good standards for
52:28 hey you can't expose the human body to
52:31 this much frequency it's going to give
52:33 people cancer so we hung on to that for
52:35 a long time then you have luckily the
52:40 LED technology that's coming out and in
52:42 the next five or six years you're going
52:44 to see a major proliferation of direct
52:46 LED surfaces which reduce the amount of
52:49 electricity required to make a screen
52:51 make a picture and so the beautiful
52:53 upgrade that we've experienced are these
52:55 these new screens however the flicker
52:57 rate of these of the screen technology
53:01 became more suggestive than ever which
53:04 is what I've been talking about in
53:05 recent episodes where when you look into
53:07 your phone you almost feel like you're
53:08 being entranced
53:10 and there's a great movie released in
53:12 the late 70s that about you mind worked
53:14 on that it's called lookers just look it
53:17 up oh okay ers and it was about the fact
53:21 that televisions can transmit a certain
53:24 frequency that stuns the audience they
53:26 can't look away during commercials what
53:29 was also very interesting in that movie
53:31 is that they predicted in the late 70s
53:33 that commercials would be completely CG
53:35 completely computer-generated and you
53:39 see there's this there's a studio in the
53:41 movie where someone's playing a
53:42 volleyball game and they're trying to
53:43 pitch some lifestyle product and it's
53:46 obviously in the movie real photo real
53:48 photography of people playing volleyball
53:50 but the the way it was narrated in the
53:53 movie was that it was all CG and you'll
53:56 probably see that cannibalized here in
53:57 the next few years I'm sure but the
53:59 black mirror or something like that but
54:02 it got down to the point where a guy
54:03 figured out that this was a cabal this
54:05 was a conspiracy to zap people with this
54:08 this particular frequency that stuns you
54:11 before you walked away from the
54:13 commercial and they would Jam the
54:14 commercial in you today they used the
54:17 sort of shock and awe technique of
54:19 jacking up the volume to stun you so the
54:22 volume makes you go oh like I was gonna
54:24 go pee but I'm I'm being traumatized
54:26 right now by a volume Jack up and I'm
54:30 gonna be sitting there staring at least
54:31 the first five seconds of the commercial
54:33 trying to get there trying to get you
54:34 hooked to it it's a very real technique
54:37 that's why televisions with smart volume
54:40 don't work because they don't want it to
54:42 work and I just put it out there my
54:47 hearing is like Bionic and so for me
54:50 when I get into a room where people are
54:52 being loud or televisions surge in
54:55 volume it just it's painful for me to
54:58 hear that and I've got plenty of friends
55:00 and musicians from you know brass
55:03 musicians all the way to big you know
55:05 rock band musicians like real row
55:08 rockers and they stay blowing out their
55:10 ears from sitting next to Marshall
55:12 stacks or playing trumpets and have any
55:13 other people's trumpets in the areas
55:14 they're not wearing an ear protection
55:16 and so everyone's kind of slightly deaf
55:18 they also have a lot of tinnitus which
55:21 is the ringing of the ear and
55:24 they have to use in order to average out
55:27 the amount of electricity that's being
55:28 created inside the air through abuse
55:31 which is a whiny ring that keeps them
55:35 from going to sleep they use televisions
55:38 at night and play music such that it
55:41 cannibal it basically cannibalizes the
55:44 electricity is being used as this
55:45 ringing noise brings down that frequency
55:48 and has a distributed over white noise
55:49 which is why televisions help people
55:51 with tinnitus go to sleep right the
55:55 frequency length of a 4G average 4G
55:58 tower technology is two and a half feet
56:00 like I said the 5g network is half inch
56:05 to an inch so it's a very very high
56:08 frequency the immediate problem which is
56:13 going to create the immediate next
56:16 problem is that anytime you have a tight
56:18 frequency you have a much reduced range
56:23 of that particular two antenna
56:25 technology of that transmission
56:28 technology so if you were to take all
56:30 the 4G or forget it take all of the cell
56:34 phone towers in the world and switch
56:35 them over to 5g networks you would
56:39 probably we would probably experience
56:42 about a 95 percent loss in signal in the
56:46 world because it's not enough towers to
56:51 transmit to all the different locations
56:53 in the world because it's too tight and
56:56 it can't bounce around a corner if it
56:58 hit your neighbor's house it wouldn't
57:00 make it into your house because it's
57:02 such a tight frequency I can't bounce
57:04 off things that much because a tight
57:06 frequency also moves at a faster
57:08 velocity as I understand it right and so
57:10 you have these these this this reception
57:14 problem so how are they planning on
57:16 fixing the 5g reception problem they are
57:20 planning on putting a 5g tower which is
57:23 going to be much smaller it's about the
57:24 size of a small book I should say maybe
57:28 an average book they're going to put it
57:32 every two houses in the world now for
57:36 those of you who have
57:37 figured out where your cable comes from
57:39 you have an average telephone pole I'm
57:41 staring at one right now and it comes
57:43 through the back we don't have a lease
57:45 between this particular block of homes
57:47 and so we have this poles these poles
57:49 that go through our back yards between
57:50 our property lines the first two to
57:54 three lines on these poles are for data
57:57 and which is usually your cable service
57:59 which is usually the carrier service for
58:01 your internet and then way up top way up
58:03 high is where you have like guess I'm
58:06 looking at yeah it's like the first two
58:08 layers which is three cables carries
58:11 your electricity and they went down
58:12 below we actually have four other ones
58:13 that are carrying electricity so you
58:15 have to climb up a pole quite quite a
58:17 distance to touch power you could
58:19 actually swing off the first two so what
58:24 they're going to do is put these little
58:25 boxes on those first two two wires and
58:28 they have to be above ground which is
58:31 another really sad cosmetic reality
58:34 there was a really interesting moment
58:37 when I lived in the Bay Area and they
58:40 were throwing Internet into the Bay Area
58:42 at once they got to ISDN which was the
58:45 precursor to the the the two services of
58:49 the cable and the one that the the name
58:52 escapes me at the moment the acronym
58:53 escapes me at the moment the one that
58:55 the telephone companies brought through
58:57 but we had such a push in the Bay Area
59:00 to get the place wired that they were
59:02 bringing Midwestern folks to the east
59:05 cut our show the West Coast excuse me to
59:07 wire this and I had a guy come in my
59:08 house from Tennessee you know being from
59:11 Kansas we had a little town Midwest
59:13 camaraderie there and he said you know
59:16 it's nuts about this he goes we are
59:18 hanging stuff on your wires here in the
59:22 Bay Area that we have deemed obsolete 20
59:24 years ago in Tennessee I said we'll keep
59:28 talking what are you talking about he
59:29 says well one he goes in Tennessee we
59:31 don't hang anything in the in the air we
59:33 put it underneath in pipes so that we
59:35 keep our neighborhoods looking clean I
59:37 mean wow right I'm in the Silicon Valley
59:40 with the ugly stupid old technology and
59:43 you have Tennessee doing it right
59:46 according to this guy
59:48 and his whole thing is look it's way
59:50 easier to maintain because you reach
59:52 into the ground you don't need a big
59:53 truck to reach up and grab the line and
59:55 move it around if someone hits a
59:57 telephone pole it doesn't hurt anything
59:58 with your internet communication hurt
60:00 your power but nothing else very
60:04 eye-opening so now once you'd imagine
60:07 the level of EMF exposure if we have a
60:13 little broadcaster every two homes now
60:17 an average because it has a short
60:18 distance of broadcasting you're not
60:21 going to be bombarded by hundreds of
60:24 these things at once you're only going
60:25 to get broadcast at by a couple of these
60:27 things but what's interesting about my
60:29 4G router that I have in my house which
60:31 is about the same size of what these
60:33 boxes will be on the wires I can go
60:36 across the street to my neighbor across
60:37 the cul-de-sac I don't even know how far
60:40 that is probably 200 feet at least sit
60:44 on that patio over there and I can use
60:46 my internet in my house I can drive
60:50 almost completely down the street before
60:52 I leave signal it's amazing right so
60:58 what are the guarantees what is the big
60:59 sale all right as I tell you about why
61:06 this is great I want you to remember
61:09 this is us selling ourselves the
61:11 amenities that we think we need to have
61:13 again in 1985 what happened
61:15 we had no internet that we were having
61:17 access to go to a college and get the
61:19 Internet but it was always through some
61:21 wired technology when you called someone
61:24 up and they weren't there you got it
61:27 basically never did anything it just
61:29 kept ringing forever if you called and
61:32 someone was on the phone in their house
61:33 you got the busy signal eventually they
61:37 came up with electronic you know
61:38 voicemail so it could kick over after so
61:40 many rings but we survived and we
61:43 thrived and we were much more social
61:45 we're much more happy we had a lot more
61:47 trade skills and talents one of the
61:49 biggest talents we had was communicating
61:51 with other human beings
61:52 we didn't go necessarily on a device and
61:56 worry about news that you can't possibly
61:59 change or affect
62:01 we only worried about our small little
62:04 world and some people the globalists
62:06 will say well you were just conditioned
62:07 xenophobes that's what was wrong with
62:09 you no that's what was right with us
62:12 right there's a serial killer going
62:15 loose and upper upstate New York and I
62:17 live in California I didn't need to
62:19 worry about that I just need to worry
62:21 about the ones in my neighborhood which
62:23 travels through word-of-mouth
62:24 travels in the local newspaper right so
62:28 the first guarantee is bit rate it's
62:31 gonna be really really fast so your
62:33 speed on your internet is going to get
62:35 insane the other thing that happens is
62:39 that with 4G technology and below
62:40 there's only so many sockets in a tower
62:43 that they can offer two devices in the
62:46 neighborhood it meaning self cellular
62:49 devices before they run out of sockets
62:52 the sockets are limited based on the
62:54 frequency of this two-foot wave this two
62:56 and a half two foot wave right and so as
62:59 as they want to introduce self-driving
63:02 cars and make absolutely everything an
63:04 EMF broadcast Center I mean every little
63:08 device they want to make it my mouse is
63:10 Wireless right it does a Bluetooth
63:12 wireless thing works great but I'm
63:14 getting exposed a little bit to that the
63:17 higher frequency of 5g is going to allow
63:20 there's there's all kinds of word
63:22 estimates from ten to a hundred times
63:23 more devices that can be handled by a 5g
63:27 network and that way you don't have
63:30 connectivity problems in your car
63:33 driving down the street using wireless
63:35 technology cellular cellular technology
63:37 excuse me will not start driving into a
63:40 field and kill people because it didn't
63:42 lose cut you know contactor won't it
63:44 won't pull over to the side of the road
63:45 because it's lost its driving
63:47 information the other one is latency now
63:51 when the internet first came out latency
63:53 was a death sentence if you lost
63:56 connection you lost connection for those
63:58 of you who play massive multiplayer
63:59 online games you'll know that world of
64:01 warcraft type games when they lost
64:04 connection with the server there was no
64:05 recovery it just lost because the
64:07 programmers hadn't figured out a lazier
64:09 way to reconnect
64:11 you know they pause your game sorta
64:13 while you've lost connection will
64:14 Warcraft you can't walk anymore you
64:16 can't do anything you're just sitting
64:18 there with an animation and then once it
64:20 reestablishes the contact in the 21st
64:22 century and the but this last decade
64:24 here you start walking again the raid
64:26 continues and everything's fine tries to
64:28 catch up as much as possible you know
64:30 you can die in the time in the meantime
64:31 because you didn't defend yourself
64:32 you're very familiar with this
64:34 well that's happening on a micro level
64:36 and 4g networks with your cell phones
64:39 you'll be transmitting a photograph and
64:41 it works great in one area you go to
64:44 this restaurant and/or the airport and
64:45 you can't get anything to transmit
64:47 because there's so much EMF wave
64:50 disruptions going on and again in
64:52 airports there are devices that gag gear
64:55 phones from working in some areas that
64:57 are more old because they have this fake
65:01 fear that you using a bunch of
65:02 cellphones on a airplane makes it fall
65:04 out of the sky
65:06 please if there was any chance of that
65:11 happening even just the theoretical
65:13 chance of that happening you would have
65:15 to turn off your cell phone getting on a
65:16 plane because you know 200 plus people
65:19 could die because five people are not
65:22 turning off their laptops not turning
65:24 off their phones it's not a risk which
65:28 is why a lot of folks do not put their
65:31 phones on airplane mode they just put it
65:33 in their bag they put it in their purse
65:34 and it's still getting messages the
65:35 entire time we're taking off in the
65:36 entire time you're landing so latency
65:41 with a faster frequency allows quicker
65:44 recovery with having a transmitter every
65:47 two houses in America the amount of
65:51 redundancy support is off the charts and
65:54 so at any one point in time you probably
65:56 have access given again my 5g router in
65:59 my house you can get across the street
66:01 well if I'm in the middle of my street
66:03 and there's a transmitter behind my
66:04 house and transmitter behind my
66:06 neighbor's house plus my wireless router
66:08 plus two or three other boxes that are
66:10 kind of in loose range to me where's the
66:13 latency going to come from I can talk to
66:15 a million arteries to the internet the
66:18 other little sad fact about 5g is that
66:20 the amount of regulations on 5g
66:22 basically don't exist and so it's an
66:25 open protocol for them to do whatever
66:26 they want
66:27 fit okay I want you to refer back to
66:30 potentially talking to the human mind it
66:34 could and there's no regulations not to
66:36 do so despite all the warnings from the
66:38 scientists there are the experts in this
66:40 technology and the human mind now for
66:42 those of you super concerned we have
66:44 sort of a tug of war going on in the
66:46 United States government I have no idea
66:47 what's going on other countries as I've
66:50 been told France again is pulled because
66:53 of the ad D of children and the overall
66:56 health risks of children they have in
66:59 many of the schools in France and I
67:01 almost can't believe this because France
67:02 doesn't seem to care about their low
67:04 sperm counts and all this other stuff
67:05 they have supposedly started pulling all
67:08 cell phone towers out of any reach of a
67:11 school as well as all the Wi-Fi out of
67:13 schools and everything's going wired now
67:16 I don't know how you tell a bunch of
67:17 kids to turn their cell phones off when
67:19 they come on the campus cell phones
67:21 aren't I believe very endorsed in any
67:23 school around the world because kids can
67:25 sit there forever doing stuff right but
67:27 I know in America you know we don't take
67:30 cellphones away from children when they
67:31 go through the door of the school maybe
67:33 in some private school they're not in
67:35 average schools in America there was a
67:39 push their head there is a push right
67:41 now from the corporation's are going to
67:43 make trillions off this technology and
67:45 the military-industrial complex that
67:48 wants to use it to do all kinds of
67:49 probably surveillance but it probably
67:51 will support a lot of military drones
67:54 and all kinds of stuff and again cell
67:56 phone towers do not broadcast up that
67:59 broadcast level and down and this is one
68:03 of the reasons why during 9/11 you know
68:06 this idea that all these people are
68:07 making phone calls it technically should
68:10 be impossible because the cell phone
68:11 towers back then weren't even 3G and so
68:15 you have a problem being you know they
68:17 weren't at 35,000 feet in most cases but
68:20 you would be traveling so quickly that
68:22 as soon as you make contact with the
68:23 tower you would have lost contact with
68:25 the tower because you're moving so
68:26 quickly right so the idea that these
68:28 phone calls were made possible doesn't
68:31 make any sense and American Airlines
68:33 finally put repeaters inside their Jets
68:37 in 2004 offering a service
68:40 and so just keep that in your bag of
68:43 facts right but there's been a delay the
68:49 corporations in the military duster
68:51 complex as I have read it okay wanted 5g
68:54 to be the standard in 2020 and as I've
68:58 read it this has been put on hold for an
69:00 evaluation now the reality behind this
69:04 delay is not being communicated publicly
69:07 in any major way but it might be that
69:12 someone at the top especially with this
69:14 renewed government that is predominantly
69:18 prioritized around the people instead of
69:20 around this these super PACs that are
69:23 globalists they may be taking a closer
69:25 look at the biological implications I
69:28 read one report that said that
69:30 California states is concerned about the
69:35 health risks of these networks in
69:38 California it is illegal to drive your
69:41 car and put the cell phone up to your
69:44 ear and a lot of it has to do with the
69:46 fact that people are wrecking their
69:49 phone wrecking their cars because
69:50 they're paying attention to their calls
69:53 more than they are in their cars you
69:56 know your mind wanders and that kind of
69:57 stuff I'm not personally convinced that
70:00 that's the issue what I think is more
70:02 dangerous is the texting because when
70:06 your brain is trying to discern language
70:08 translating symbols into meaning you are
70:11 using a lot of process power without you
70:13 realize it or not and driving and
70:15 operating a vehicle at the same time it
70:18 becomes a lethal combination but in
70:21 terms of holding a cell phone to your
70:22 head and driving down the street looking
70:25 your heads looking straight ahead I
70:26 think that poses a lot less danger
70:28 however you're driving wise but your
70:31 health it's bad so by then passing a
70:34 little law for those that are willing to
70:36 follow that law which only a handful are
70:40 there's less exposure I had a really
70:44 funny experience for those of you who
70:46 may be debating whether or not cell
70:48 phones have any cancer risks at all
70:50 again it's not the phone call itself
70:51 necessarily it's the power supply
70:53 on your phone as I've said for years my
70:56 daughter who never really expressed much
70:58 of an opinion about it but you know
70:59 she's got a look at her old man every
71:01 once in a while I gotta go man you
71:02 believe a lot of weird crap right she
71:06 went off to college and did a report me
71:08 it was the tail in a high school I think
71:10 it was the first year college she did a
71:11 report on cell phone cancer and she was
71:14 able to uncover --is-- cuz she [ __ ] me
71:16 she sent to me the report she was able
71:18 to uncover more photographs of
71:21 conclusive proof breast cancer and brain
71:25 tumor cancer than I've ever seen ever
71:27 she what a great report on it so hooray
71:31 for our side right so what can we do
71:34 about all this information because it's
71:37 sort of it's sort of sad right it's
71:40 we've created some amazing inventions
71:42 but we have created sort of the slowly
71:45 thil technology that you know it's
71:51 there's a couple ways to look at this
71:53 right you know a lot of people could
71:57 blow stuff off until they're sick until
71:59 they're dying and until they realize
72:02 that they have perhaps become sick
72:04 earlier than they should have because of
72:06 Technology people who you know we've all
72:10 detoxified out of diet drinks and sugar
72:13 substitutes and all kinds of toxins
72:16 right well there's alternatives you
72:20 don't have to drink diet soda that's has
72:22 aspartame in it you don't have to brush
72:24 for fluoride you don't have to do a
72:25 bunch of things GMO food you can get
72:27 organic foods with this particular
72:29 option there's probably about depending
72:34 on your use of technology if you're an
72:37 older person you probably have 60 to 70%
72:39 alternatives to this toxicity of EMF
72:42 waves if you are younger you probably
72:47 only have twenty ten to twenty percent
72:49 alternatives because you're so hooked on
72:51 cellular devices right I am unaware of
72:55 any technology where we plug it into the
72:57 bottom of our phone and we can tether
72:59 off of an Ethernet connection right
73:01 there might be a way to route that to
73:04 your computer
73:06 I don't think that
73:07 what they want to do the whole idea is
73:08 they get a kickback from the cellular
73:11 programs that you sign up for in some
73:15 cases the other thing is that if society
73:19 goes along with all this technology
73:21 which we have as a group I'm not immune
73:23 from this then the exposure of the
73:28 technology in your home is not something
73:32 you can completely control now again the
73:36 the meters on the side of your house
73:38 again they're only broadcasting a couple
73:41 times a day so probably not the most
73:45 lethal thing even though it is
73:46 definitely broadcasting on that
73:48 particular frequency the people in San
73:49 Francisco who are at the bottom of that
73:51 tower are getting bombarded second to
73:54 second that's why there are 93 times
73:56 more likely to die of leukemia as well
73:59 as other things the types of cancer you
74:02 can get is again brain tumors is a big
74:05 byproduct of EMF waves proven thyroid
74:08 cancer proven salivary gland cancer
74:11 proven testicular cancer breast cancer
74:15 potentially skin cancer you know but
74:18 it's sort of once you get the insides of
74:20 your body messed up the outsides well
74:22 that's a more of a cosmetic thing and
74:24 even though we have alternatives to
74:26 fight cancer that that we've now
74:28 discovered over the last several years
74:29 of the internet releasing sort of the
74:32 information about this you know that
74:34 would be the only thing that they could
74:35 do is say the cell phone companies Lobby
74:37 the medical industry to get rid of their
74:39 dogma get rid of their chemotherapy and
74:41 start telling us how to live cancer-free
74:44 and then it's like okay EMFs cause
74:46 cancerous cells but take this magic pill
74:49 and it will help your immune system kill
74:52 all the invaders and then we can live
74:54 happily ever after we've counteracted
74:56 this this problem so some of us will
74:58 have to to do that to stay healthy but
75:03 your children I think is where it gets
75:06 really real for people for those of you
75:08 have amazing relationships with your
75:10 parents or older folks who are going to
75:12 be susceptible to this that'll also
75:14 bring it home but there's nothing that
75:15 brings it home more intensely than a
75:17 child
75:20 so from my household for instance I can
75:23 probably throw a 50 to 60 foot cable
75:26 into my office from my router and shut
75:29 off the wireless capability on my router
75:32 and simply use the wired and use a
75:34 router us but I started switch to give
75:36 me more ports that's what I do on the
75:38 back of my television is that I use a
75:41 wire technology to fuel my televisions
75:43 Netflix there's no wireless coming out
75:45 of my television but unless I can tell
75:48 my television stop looking for a
75:49 wireless service then it's still gonna
75:52 bombard me with its wire cart now
75:58 outside of cell phones and cell towers
76:01 the nice thing about even a cell phone
76:04 for instance there is a certain
76:06 proximity around the device where it
76:08 starts to become safe or safer for
76:12 instance a laptop with the power supply
76:14 if you put it on your lap okay the power
76:18 supply from the computer and the
76:20 wireless router but mostly the power
76:22 supply is going to be essentially not
76:25 good for you the cells in your thighs
76:27 what's the average distance from a
76:29 computer you can be it's really eight to
76:31 ten inches eight to ten inches and you
76:34 are pretty much in the safe mode and so
76:36 you'd have to sit on a desktop with your
76:38 laptop so it's away from you not on your
76:41 lap and you know your hands are then in
76:44 the proximity but your hands are pretty
76:45 tough there's not a lot of complex
76:47 granular organs right in your hands
76:48 there's none and so at that point you're
76:52 attacking your blood cells
76:54 you know leukemia is a blood disease and
76:57 so you have to take into account how
77:00 that works now again wires are super
77:02 pain in the butt holding the cell phone
77:05 to your head well as I've said several
77:07 times on the show I use an apple headset
77:10 on my Android phone because the quality
77:12 is higher on an android headset or
77:15 excuse me on an apple headset than any
77:16 other technology I've been able to find
77:18 there's people that use the Bluetooth
77:20 earpieces it's a lot less EMF waves than
77:24 putting the cell phone to your ear but
77:26 it does it's so close it's right on top
77:29 of your cellular tissue and you have all
77:30 kinds of very important things in your
77:33 head in your ears and so it might lead
77:37 to tinnitus might be an extra way to
77:40 injure your inner ear and all the
77:42 mechanisms that translate vibration into
77:44 electricity
77:46 so going wire based is probably the very
77:50 best thing you could do for your media
77:51 at home I recently was gifted a Amazon
77:57 fire stick and so the problem with the
78:00 fire stick is that as long as it's
78:01 powered up it needs a wireless
78:03 connection in order to work there is no
78:05 Ethernet card in the back of this thing
78:07 so if I want to use that particular
78:10 service I have to unplug it if I'm not
78:13 going to use it and turn the power off I
78:16 could leave it plugged in but I could
78:17 pull the power off or just unplug it
78:19 from the ground maybe I have a different
78:20 power strip down there to get rid of
78:22 that but then I'm gonna have to visit my
78:23 router firmware through the internet
78:25 browser and tell it to turn on the
78:28 wireless connection for that particular
78:30 viewing experience I'm willing to do
78:32 that I'm willing to do that after this
78:34 recent research I'm willing to do that
78:38 you know there's a lot of talk about
78:40 high tension towers carrying power by
78:43 your house well you know because there
78:47 is so much power going through those
78:49 wires you are getting bombarded in your
78:51 home with a light constant stream of
78:56 electrons and that is our electric
79:00 magnetic waves I should say technically
79:02 speaking I have known friends of mine
79:04 that lived next to them they got houses
79:06 for cheaper because they lived next to
79:08 them and they've had issues with birth
79:10 defects very severe ones that took the
79:13 life of their children within two years
79:14 you know it's hard to say whether or not
79:17 there's a connection there could have
79:19 been that the mom before we knew any of
79:21 this stuff had the phone in her pocket
79:23 and she messed up a particular egg it's
79:27 a little you know it's possible this
79:29 particular family went on I had another
79:30 child and had a perfectly normal child
79:32 but again we when you have a field of
79:39 energy that is messing with the brain's
79:41 ability to communicate with itself and
79:43 people are going into a didi they're
79:45 having memory loss
79:46 issues there having just basically
79:48 continuous thought problems how do you
79:51 how are you going to find the culprit
79:53 that's making that happen besides
79:54 changing the inside of your house to see
79:57 if everyone sleeps a little bit better
80:00 so what I'm committed to do is wire my
80:04 house completely and the only bummer
80:08 that's happening here is that the if I
80:11 want to watch media on my phone I don't
80:14 have infinite minutes because most
80:16 carriers don't have it and if they do
80:17 they throttle you anyway so I may need
80:19 to switch to a carrier that has infinite
80:22 minutes and then at night put my phone
80:24 into well but this way anytime I'm not
80:28 accessing heavy media or on my sleep
80:31 I'll put it into airplane mode to keep
80:33 the wireless router turned off in the
80:35 front of my house now I keep my wireless
80:36 router on the other side of my home
80:38 what's amazing is because I'm able to
80:41 get 25 Meg's per second in my office
80:43 that's 50 feet away and I'm able to get
80:48 again a weak signal but it's fairly
80:50 decent across the street so there's a
80:53 lot of different routers I could have a
80:54 neighbor that puts a router on the other
80:56 side of the adjoining wall but you know
80:59 it's a wall it's probably 15 feet away
81:01 from my wall and so I'm getting
81:02 bombarded by their router it just
81:04 depends so this is a very complex issue
81:08 to get rid of I will say that probably
81:11 getting the router in your house
81:13 disabled is going to greatly reduce and
81:17 I mean maybe in the you know just as a
81:21 hunched feeling maybe 60 to 80% of the
81:24 exposures that you have to wireless
81:25 technology in your home again your meter
81:28 I did the research on that two times a
81:31 day you're okay you know be like kind of
81:34 if you're standing right next to it
81:35 you're probably getting the same kind of
81:36 reiation you get at a body scanner in an
81:38 airport I personally have never gone to
81:41 a body scanner an airport that I can
81:42 remember and I don't do it necessarily
81:46 because I'm gonna die of it I just don't
81:48 do it out of a matter of principle and
81:50 it's sort of a warm feeling later on to
81:52 say you know I've never been through
81:53 that hopefully this episode helped you
81:56 get sort of your your mind together with
81:59 what's going on
82:01 you know having a repeater every two
82:03 houses or I should say a 5g tower every
82:07 two houses and it's not going to be a
82:08 tower it's gonna be a little box on the
82:10 back of the pole wires the lower two
82:13 wires on your house you are going to
82:17 have to lobby your Senators and
82:20 what-have-you but I can guarantee you
82:21 that's probably gonna have a 1% effect a
82:24 1% effect I've been told that you can in
82:28 California at least petition the power
82:30 company to take these electronic ones
82:32 off off the side of your house and get
82:34 the manual ones and then they will come
82:36 by and read it every once in a while
82:37 when I learned that only broadcast a
82:39 couple times a day I'm not terribly
82:41 concerned I would be terribly concerned
82:44 if I did it every hour but that's
82:46 unnecessary
82:47 right it's overuse of the technology so
82:50 hopefully you're you're on board with
82:52 all this all the options and all the
82:54 technology here if you have any
82:55 questions put them in the comment
82:57 section down below if you have good
82:58 videos on YouTube put them down there of
83:02 the ones I've watched on YouTube the guy
83:04 or girl will be really informative up to
83:06 a point and then they start by entering
83:07 in a loop and saying the same exact
83:10 thing over and over again and I think
83:11 that that's kind of injuring the
83:13 movement it almost makes you feel like
83:14 you know morons are the only people that
83:17 petition against this kind of thing it's
83:19 I don't want to really propagate views
83:21 if I find a really good video I'll put
83:23 it up there if you dig the show please
83:26 go to deep thoughts radio.com all the
83:27 feeds are there video audio it's on
83:30 iTunes Google Play you can support me on
83:32 patreon if you like for those of you are
83:34 thank you so much I think it's about all
83:36 I'm gonna say take care of yourself and
83:38 someone else and I'll see the next G
