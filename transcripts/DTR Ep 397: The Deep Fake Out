00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen of course I set this whole
00:38 thing up and literally the second I push
00:40 record on my camera my neighbor randomly
00:43 picks today to [ __ ] weed whack his
00:45 backyard he's never on the same day cuz
00:47 he does the job himself so gotta
00:50 celebrate dad for him so it's gonna be a
00:52 little environmental here hopefully
00:55 doesn't really come up much on the mic
00:56 but it is behind me so it's going up
00:59 over the fence and directly into the mic
01:03 today we're gonna talk about an
01:05 extremely complex dangerous simple
01:10 concept called the deep fake fraud now
01:14 this is fairly new in the lexicon of
01:16 conspiracy so there'll be a lot of
01:18 average people and I don't mean that in
01:21 any way shape or form to be a derogative
01:24 reference I would say normal as in
01:27 normal good people who won't have heard
01:29 of this so what is the deep fake the
01:34 deep fake is an interesting strategy to
01:38 pollute reality with fakery by those who
01:45 know they have some badge
01:47 that's been videotaped over the years so
01:51 there is a core strategy which is pretty
01:54 basic that says oh my god they got all
01:56 this video tape and potentially like
01:59 anthony Weiner's insurance folder and so
02:04 if that drops is going to destroy
02:06 humanity and blah blah blah which isn't
02:10 true that's what they want you to
02:12 believe so they can save their own
02:13 legacies potentially there's a think
02:17 tank out there that says we have to
02:19 preserve the integrity of America and if
02:22 we ever find out that America is so
02:24 goddamn stupid that they let people like
02:26 Hillary Clinton in office then we
02:30 wouldn't stand a chance of scraping off
02:32 the scum from our personal being right
02:37 all right
02:39 so what have we seen over the last
02:41 probably five years we've seen a ton of
02:43 CG computer-generated artwork that is
02:49 photo real and but there's a difference
02:53 it's sort of an amateur thing meaning
02:58 when you go to a moving you see a
02:59 Michael Bay movie you know that it's
03:02 fiction you've paid money to be
03:04 entertained by a story and all that kind
03:06 of stuff when you go on the internet and
03:10 you look at your home feed and Facebook
03:12 then you got a problem
03:14 and that's people are injecting stuff
03:16 that's fake they don't know it's fake
03:18 and they call it real and then a bunch
03:20 of other people get in and think it's
03:22 real and that's what they want what have
03:27 we seen in the last month we have seen a
03:30 video of Nancy Pelosi up at a podium and
03:34 they simply slowed down the video which
03:37 made her voice seem slow and she wasn't
03:41 thinking properly suggesting that she
03:44 was drunk at the podium no you don't
03:47 need to CG [ __ ] with Nancy Pelosi Nancy
03:50 Pelosi makes Nancy Pelosi look stupid
03:52 she is always you know she's like an
03:56 excited person so she's always excited
04:01 to take a [ __ ] on humanity and excited
04:03 to take a [ __ ] on another human being
04:04 and so she gets all tongue-tied when she
04:07 goes up to the podium because her goal
04:10 in life is evil [ __ ] division and
04:14 separation and she wants to always take
04:19 her Stockholm Syndrome
04:20 you know captor which is her controlling
04:25 banking cartel leaders and convince them
04:29 that she's doing her job so what is this
04:32 deep fake thing all about well we have
04:35 had for the last several years on social
04:37 media various computer-generated movies
04:42 and pictures slapped into the overall
04:47 feed of the mind of man claimed as a
04:50 reality only to find out late
04:53 that we've been duped and it's not real
04:56 but in the same three years since
04:59 Anthony Weiner has been apprehended and
05:01 they found it a a folder on his laptop
05:05 that said insurance we know there's
05:08 there's some pretty nasty [ __ ] on people
05:10 out there we don't know exactly what it
05:12 is there's a rumor that uma Abedini and
05:14 Hillary Clinton murdered a child and
05:16 Lolita Island and had a video taped and
05:18 it was on that computer don't know if
05:20 that's true hey that was actually
05:23 discussed with the CEO of Google the
05:25 second he entered the hearing in the
05:27 Senate the House committee or whatever
05:31 it was so they've got all these videos
05:35 out there of all kinds of people doing
05:37 rotten [ __ ] and what they are going to
05:40 try to do with this deep fake maneuver
05:42 is to educate the people that you can't
05:46 trust reality anymore especially not
05:48 video we've got the new one where Mona
05:51 Lisa is moving her face and talking it's
05:54 it's wild it's really cool technology
05:57 it's been around for a long time but the
06:00 guy that made the new Twilight so he's
06:05 he's the host of the new Twilight Zone
06:06 you make it but he went out and gotten
06:09 personated to impersonate Obama's voice
06:11 then they ran some really kind of junkie
06:14 version of the simulation of Obama
06:15 giving a speech that he didn't give and
06:18 of course it's your leftist hate Trump
06:20 [ __ ] but there's been much better
06:24 simulations of Obama giving a speech
06:26 with all kinds of different photographs
06:28 of him being the template for the face
06:30 right so we've seen some amazing work
06:33 and again I've told you guys numerous
06:35 times I was solicited in the video game
06:39 business to use technology to do these
06:41 face simulations and they were if you
06:44 wanted to really push the envelope and
06:45 spend the money then no one would know
06:47 that what you were staring out was a
06:49 completely fictional being based on a
06:51 real person's face of course but being
06:54 being animated by anyone at all so the
06:59 big maneuver the big initial maneuver
07:01 will be to absolutely injure the
07:03 credibility of reality when you see it
07:06 is going to get so powerful and so messy
07:11 and destructive to the human mind that
07:14 if you've ever seen a show where someone
07:16 starts traveling through time or like
07:20 like subtle time changes not necessarily
07:23 like you know going to the Future or
07:26 something but but you know five minutes
07:28 ahead our head lose a day whatever or
07:31 they are experiencing some light
07:33 paranormal magic in this fictitious
07:35 series you might be watching you know
07:38 how the characters break down and they
07:41 lose grip on reality and they can't
07:43 trust anything and you know there's been
07:47 shows that I have mentioned on this on
07:51 this show but I've analyzed where you
07:53 have getting to a point where an
07:55 individual kills a family member but he
07:59 kills the family member because he
08:01 doesn't trust his reality and he thinks
08:03 that he's looking in effect simile of
08:04 his family member when it's actually a
08:06 near and dear very close family member
08:09 to him also imagine trying to keep track
08:11 of the world where if you simply look at
08:13 anyone animated in any anything the news
08:17 a commercial a television show any
08:20 eyewitness to a bad situation you
08:23 literally can't trust it because the
08:25 entire thing to be CG imagine victims to
08:29 events that never occurred being created
08:31 in a computer and someone thinks that an
08:34 FF actually went real and all these
08:37 people are actually hurt and there's no
08:38 actors there's no props
08:41 there's no fake blood there's no nothing
08:42 it's all just CG not a good thing for us
08:48 to mess with the fabric of this but man
08:51 is completely unequipped to deal with
08:53 this problem menace man is ill-equipped
08:56 to have the conversation in any way
08:58 shape or form in my opinion obviously
09:01 there's a sliver of us that could teach
09:04 the class on this stuff right and it's
09:06 you and me but the overall public we
09:10 have to have absolute sympathy and
09:12 empathy for because our parents our
09:15 grandparents some people that are just
09:17 absolutely dialed out
09:19 but sort of carry in an opinion but
09:22 they're dialed out there dangerous
09:24 because they're going to be the ones
09:26 that react to fakeness now what's
09:30 interesting is for last 20 years we know
09:33 through the BBC's Admissions and other
09:35 intelligence agencies admissions that a
09:37 lot of things that we have seen that it
09:38 manipulated people's votes that have
09:41 manipulated people into fearing things
09:42 the sort of supporting agendas we know
09:48 that they have been manipulated by in
09:53 studio things and so they've got issues
09:56 you know again the the guy that was that
09:59 the the British DJ that supposedly did
10:02 the first beheading where he's all in
10:04 black and it's the first Isis beheading
10:05 and it has the guy in orange and he's in
10:07 the desert or whatever and then it was
10:10 later exposed by you know senator
10:12 no-names assistant that it was all shot
10:14 in a Pakistani film studio because one
10:17 year prior that exact scene was in a
10:21 television show and so all they did was
10:24 they bought the same set same director
10:26 and then of course the guy who's doing
10:29 all the cutting supposedly the
10:31 fictitious acting cutting he he's
10:34 fingered as this DJ from England and
10:37 it's like could you imagine somebody
10:39 fingering you and it's someone in a
10:42 burka someone in a ninja outfit and
10:46 there just goes on the news it was you
10:48 just because you happen to travel
10:50 overseas and they oh no it was that guy
10:53 so that's the problem that's one of the
10:56 problems don't trust the stuff that's
10:58 immediately gonna come out against
11:00 people that are screaming that therefore
11:02 you know the people but they've actually
11:04 always been for the deep state the
11:05 record shows they're from the deep state
11:07 they never did anything for their
11:08 country
11:09 in fact they sold their country out nine
11:12 ways to Sunday and so they're gonna try
11:15 to muddy those waters now the second
11:17 tier of this it's a little more
11:20 dangerous they're going to frame
11:23 innocent people not just the big popular
11:27 ones that you would name and you would
11:29 be correct but they're gonna start
11:30 framing everyone and everything
11:34 there well I'll tell you this as I
11:38 mentioned this a really long time ago
11:39 but this is sort of the subatomic fabric
11:41 of how badly this stuff can occur if
11:44 they want to frame you for something and
11:47 again if you don't have protection and
11:50 you don't have the IQ or I shouldn't say
11:52 thank you
11:53 IQ does help but if you don't have the
11:55 smarts to defend yourself against a
12:00 framing job then you got a huge problem
12:02 on your hands and it would go something
12:05 like this
12:05 like if somebody says you sent an email
12:08 from someone to someone else it depends
12:13 on how they're claiming this occurred
12:15 because an email is just a file on a
12:18 server God has some scrambled headers in
12:21 it but if you're sending emails on
12:22 someone else's behalf you could send a
12:25 fairly innocent email scrape that header
12:27 off with all of its unique identifiers
12:28 stuff then later save it upgrade it with
12:31 a different message on the server so
12:32 you've never read the one that's on your
12:34 server unless you go back in and start
12:37 digging around but they can Forge emails
12:40 in your name they can do it you know
12:44 most of you don't know that when you
12:46 watch television and anytime in a movie
12:49 or television show where you see an
12:51 actor watching a television a lot of
12:54 times that is inserted post-production
12:59 they're actually staring at maybe some
13:02 paused photograph but because of the
13:04 scanrate
13:05 certain monitors there's usually some
13:07 artifacting and flickering going on in
13:10 the camera unless they set it up
13:11 initially to film a television so when
13:14 you see shows that are like Mission
13:16 Impossible or West world where they're
13:18 filming a lot of command center things
13:20 they're not filming a television that's
13:23 why Star Trek all the series of Star
13:26 Trek from the 87 and up they they had
13:29 either superimposed you know the
13:33 forward-looking camera outside of the
13:34 outside of the ship or if they were
13:37 testing some of the controls it was all
13:39 backlit gels that were beautifully
13:41 designed by hand you know it's just
13:42 light coming up through these gels
13:46 there's no flickering in that so I was
13:48 worried free brilliant idea I mean
13:50 brilliant
13:52 so everything that would be added to a
13:58 court discovery process to suggest that
14:02 you have done something or haven't done
14:03 something can be easily forged there
14:07 were for instance the the Vegas guy and
14:13 I won't use the key word for what he's
14:14 normally called but the guy in Vegas who
14:17 was on the thirty was he thirty third
14:20 floor supposedly I should say doing
14:27 something out the window against some
14:28 people watching a country country in
14:30 Western concert they said it was him
14:33 they later showed you because the big
14:37 question was how did this guy get
14:39 somewhere around a thousand pounds worth
14:42 of equipment up to that floor all by
14:44 himself that's a lot of trips man
14:45 because you can't carry you know you can
14:48 carry certain stuff into an elevator and
14:50 then set it down and then you're gonna
14:52 be able to lift it but come on I just
14:54 helped my friend lift something
14:55 yesterday that was probably a hundred
14:56 and fifty hundred seventy five pounds
14:58 somewhere in there
15:01 probably wrong on that but it was so
15:03 heavy it was like whoa and you'd have to
15:07 make 10 trips as a human being if you
15:09 were Arnold Schwarzenegger and his prime
15:12 to be carrying a hundred pounds of stuff
15:14 out of a vehicle through a parking lot
15:17 into a lobby into a freight elevator up
15:20 and down the hallway and it just it
15:23 would take forever and there was no
15:24 footage of that initially then later on
15:28 magically and only distributed really in
15:32 within the conspiracy circles of the
15:34 world there was this footage who said it
15:37 was him now we know but the talking Mona
15:41 Lisa well that could be anybody with
15:44 that you know the CG face of that guy
15:47 and the reason why is that the coroner
15:49 came out said the guy died at 12:30 p.m.
15:52 that afternoon roughly and so he was
15:55 long dead before he was supposedly
15:57 paying attention to the window
15:59 interesting so there's a who who was the
16:05 guy I forgot the senator what are you
16:06 guys are gonna remember see it was
16:09 Schumer Schumer came out an interview
16:12 and he was bragging because the deep
16:15 state was still in full effect and his
16:18 candidate was gonna win and he I believe
16:22 it was prior to the actual vote of the
16:23 election of 2016 and he said you know
16:25 what he says I'm gonna paraphrase here
16:29 four key word reasons he said you know
16:31 the the black hats have nine ways to
16:34 Sunday to get to get back at you if you
16:38 get if you get them essentially what
16:42 Schumer was saying in my opinion and I
16:45 think most of you would agree if you're
16:46 awake Schumer is a deep stator he's a
16:50 weasel he's that Iago in any script of
16:53 any movie he's the guy that will stab
16:55 you in the back the second that he could
17:00 and he has big friends at his mind which
17:06 is the deep state
17:07 you know sliver of a single percent of
17:10 people that are willing to destroy their
17:11 country in the world for a short time
17:13 paycheck so he was essentially
17:17 threatening this candidate for
17:20 presidency with what his big brother can
17:23 do or what his dad can do or whatever
17:25 right it's it's essentially the agency
17:27 that keeps him in power and the funny
17:31 thing is is it's something that you say
17:32 if you're stupid if you're gonna play
17:36 poker with a great poker player do you
17:39 show your hand
17:41 do you give off indicators in your face
17:45 based on every card that you have popped
17:47 into your hand that is a deadly hand
17:50 because you realize poker is a skill
17:52 based game it's not a random game and
17:54 the second that someone smells you have
17:56 a hand from hell and you're gonna wipe
17:58 the whole [ __ ] table clean they just
18:00 fold they don't bet they don't lose any
18:02 money they bet and your hand just goes
18:03 right back into the deck and you wasted
18:06 your royal flush and that's what Schumer
18:09 did
18:10 that's a Pelosi did a
18:12 so Obama did that's what George Clooney
18:14 did that's what De Niro did
18:16 that's what Biden did they all ran their
18:18 mouth because they never thought she'd
18:20 lose now she lost they got the problem
18:25 they have called on every artery and
18:28 you're gonna see a lot more of this deep
18:30 fake movement you can't trust anything
18:33 because it can all be done inside of a
18:35 computer now in the end the truth of the
18:39 matter is is that we could actually have
18:41 our own truth movement Snopes built out
18:45 of special-effects people and I
18:47 guarantee you if there's anything that
18:49 comes out on the web that is going to be
18:51 heavily debated as being real or fake
18:53 there's gonna be plenty of people like
18:55 me and my friends who are going to be
18:58 able to what we call pixel [ __ ] those
19:01 images and find the plug-ins find the
19:05 smoothing find the lack of motion that's
19:09 proper we will see whether we'll be able
19:12 to calculate in our brains whether or
19:14 not it's an off-the-shelf tool a custom
19:16 tool or real we will now some things
19:22 we're not gonna waste our time on not
19:24 the guy from Vegas why waste our time on
19:26 that guy he was dead nearly eight hours
19:31 before they said he started doing what
19:33 he did you know I'm not gonna waste my
19:36 time on looking at the footage of him I
19:40 mean I may have more of a curiosity at
19:42 some point now it's interesting with the
19:45 moon missions because this kind of
19:47 fakery has begun around for a long time
19:49 isn't it I mean weren't there moon
19:51 missions one of the very first
19:53 aboveboard fey curries that we've ever
19:56 had I mean obviously the footage is real
19:58 it's not CG but it's really not on the
20:02 moon your footage of Mars real in some
20:09 cases I do believe there's some I mean I
20:11 put this way if the close-up shots of
20:13 the soil and the little experiments
20:16 where they're cutting little balls of
20:18 you know rock in half if that is truly
20:21 CG then they've done a brilliant job
20:25 with Terrigen well you can't you can't
20:30 tell me that any surface that looks like
20:33 Mars is real because Terrigen can do it
20:36 it's phenomenal and believe me with a
20:39 few plugin encoders you could add even
20:41 more granularity with the right
20:43 supercomputer you could take project
20:46 products like Terrigen and turn them up
20:49 so high that the average studio couldn't
20:52 afford to render what they'll show you
20:55 but what do you get you get still
20:57 photographs that's a lot different than
21:00 a moving photograph but they could do
21:02 moving as well but once you start moving
21:04 things
21:05 that's where cg stuff starts to fail
21:08 miserably it could be very difficult to
21:11 look up a single image that's been CG
21:14 this person you know sitting in a hotel
21:17 with a prostitute and or call-girl or
21:21 whatever doing something that other
21:23 people don't do okay now panning a
21:27 camera on a terrain without any anything
21:30 moving on the terrain that's not
21:33 difficult that's like a 360 type shot
21:36 even if they're saying that each frame
21:38 is new and being captured over time
21:40 that's not much that's going on there
21:43 however if there is wind on the surface
21:46 of Mars and the wind gusts are gonna
21:49 come in and bounce around all the rocks
21:52 and take the soil and move it well those
21:56 are the algorithms could be very simple
21:58 and it could be very difficult what if a
22:02 rover got inside of a or don't even
22:04 inside but got over to a gigantic
22:08 volcanic crater and so you might have a
22:11 crater that's humongous like Diamondhead
22:14 in Hawaii and then it would be okay well
22:20 how does all of the during a big storm
22:22 how does all this stuff cascade down
22:26 inside the crater AO does it blow out of
22:27 the crater whatever and isn't it
22:30 interesting that my entire life they've
22:32 told me that just theoretically speaking
22:36 Mars would have pretty pretty
22:39 violence windstorms at a minimum because
22:43 it supposedly has a little bit of a
22:45 atmosphere it's not oxygen but now why
22:51 hasn't any of these Rovers filmed one of
22:53 the most formidable experiences out
22:56 there the movie Martian with Matt Damon
22:59 that's what's called right the whole
23:01 movie is predicated on a storm that tore
23:04 the crap out of the place and that's why
23:06 they were in danger it's the first scene
23:08 why hasn't any of these Rovers why
23:12 haven't one of these Rovers film one of
23:14 those from far away coming out or during
23:17 a storm I mean you might as well take
23:20 pictures because I mean there's a couple
23:23 problems here but you might as well take
23:26 pictures because it'd be could be the
23:27 last time you ever see the robot - I
23:30 don't personally remember the way that
23:33 the first two big Rovers were designed
23:36 that landed in the 2003-2004 era because
23:42 2001-2004 somewhere in there but I
23:45 remember how it works but can you
23:46 imagine having any sort of glass lens or
23:49 even Plexiglas or something like that
23:52 between the camera's lens and the
23:53 outside world if that doesn't get
23:55 shielded during a storm it's gonna be
23:58 sandblasted into smoky filter and so
24:03 even if the thing is on and roving
24:05 around you're not gonna be able to see
24:07 but we never had that problem
24:09 those lenses are always perfect and you
24:13 don't get shots that clean on an f1 race
24:15 at least when it rains right there's
24:17 always some speckles in there or
24:18 something so I believe personally if the
24:23 17 movement is real and just in fact
24:27 that doesn't have to be the only
24:28 linchpin to make this effectively a
24:30 something we need to look forward look
24:32 look forward to and be cautionary
24:35 towards but I believe that they're
24:38 really really scared of a lot of things
24:41 coming out and you know what they could
24:43 be fairly basic things we have seen a
24:47 whole series of photographs of Obama in
24:50 Islamic Muslim gear
24:53 over seas you know and he's hanging out
24:57 and doing his thing
24:58 now again if the guy had just come out
25:00 and said look I'm a Muslim
25:04 I don't preach any radical Islamic
25:08 religion I just I'm different you know
25:11 we're in America we can prove [ __ ] we
25:13 could have a Jewish president and he
25:15 could say I don't believe in Jesus
25:17 Christ what if Bernie Sanders became
25:19 president no one's gonna give him crap
25:21 for not believing Christianity so Obama
25:23 didn't need to lie that he was a
25:25 Christian or he could say look I went
25:28 through that whole Muslim thing when I
25:29 was young like a lot of guys my age and
25:32 I simply decided it wasn't for me he
25:36 could have done that but he didn't do it
25:38 he kept up the lie the whole time but I
25:40 guess when he went to Virginia
25:41 University again I've seen photographs
25:42 of this I don't know if they're real it
25:45 looked pretty [ __ ] real to me but he
25:47 had the Secret Service cover-up statues
25:51 of Mary statues of Jesus the picture I
25:53 saw of him was at a podium in a church
25:58 and behind him was a Christ that was all
26:01 covered up so I don't if someone
26:04 synthesized that together the story came
26:08 out of individuals at the University
26:10 going Rao's was really weird couldn't
26:12 even believe this and the thing is is
26:15 like if even that's true the the weird
26:19 thing is is think about it couldn't you
26:22 go to a mosque if you were invited to
26:24 speak and be honored be sorry be
26:26 respectful of someone else's religion
26:28 and leave all their stuff up could you
26:30 go into a synagogue and just leave it
26:32 alone and speak even though you're not
26:34 Jewish wouldn't it be easy to do that if
26:37 you were a scientist and you didn't
26:40 believe in Christ couldn't you speak at
26:41 a church to share what you have without
26:43 covering up the cross doesn't make any
26:47 sense so no one no one really knows at
26:51 least that I know personally what's out
26:55 there what's coming what are they trying
26:56 to blur but I want to take it a little
27:00 bit further than that and I want to
27:05 liken it to azimoff's rule
27:06 for a robot isaac asimov wild dude man
27:13 brilliant he looked deep inside in the
27:16 40s deep inside the initiative of what
27:20 if we were to turn on robots to exist
27:26 with man we would need a code of ethics
27:30 a code of possibilities to restrict
27:34 those robots from taking over our world
27:37 and in the 1955-1956 excuse me movie
27:43 Forbidden Planet which is when I did my
27:44 movie review I forgot to actually say
27:46 the name unfortunately Robby the Robot
27:49 had these imperatives but they didn't
27:51 give any credit to Asimov for it but
27:53 there was a point where Morbius was
27:58 trying to teach Leslie Nielsen's
28:00 character was the captain of the ship
28:02 you have nothing to worry about when it
28:04 comes to Robby the Robot he could pull
28:05 you apart you know with his bare hands
28:09 but he has programming this says he
28:11 can't hurt humans and he said he says so
28:14 the example in the movie was can I see
28:16 your blaster and he looks around alright
28:20 guess blaster
28:22 Morbius gives it to Robbie the robot and
28:25 he goes aim this thing right between the
28:27 eyes of the captain and you know
28:31 everyone's kind of like you know Lizzy's
28:32 kinda like standard obviously oh [ __ ]
28:34 this is a weird planet in the middle of
28:37 [ __ ] the galaxy this little guy could
28:38 technically kill us all nobody would
28:41 know and then he goes fire and Robbie
28:46 goes into this complete self-destruction
28:48 mode he starts turning red they put a
28:51 red gel over him inside the exposure of
28:53 the film and all they drew all this
28:55 electricity and he's like engineer
28:58 and he's like cancel cancel command
29:02 Robbie or something like that
29:03 Neary goes back to normal and he grabs
29:06 the flasher gives it back to the captain
29:08 he goes if I had loud him to continue he
29:10 would have burned out every circuit in
29:12 his body because he's uh not allowed to
29:14 do this so keep that in your head
29:19 he has some off rules for a robot you're
29:22 not allowed to do anything that would
29:24 either directly or indirectly affect the
29:26 health of a human being that's really
29:27 what it boils down to well think about
29:29 guns guns weapons of any kind projectile
29:35 weapons they who knows what the very
29:40 first use of them were right probably
29:41 war and then we sort of calmed down as a
29:45 world that's what I got done with that
29:48 but then again the last several wars for
29:51 last two or three hundred years have all
29:52 been instigated by banks paid for by
29:54 banks and evil by banks but they were
29:56 also designed to conquer people to get
29:59 the Bunder Bank rule because these
30:02 people are vicious Psychopaths who will
30:05 stop at nothing it's bad news man so now
30:11 the bankers realized oh [ __ ] we didn't
30:16 want the people to have this stuff we
30:19 wanted to have our soldiers our
30:20 mercenaries who fight for us to have it
30:22 and so now they're trying to take them
30:25 away from America the last bastion they
30:29 don't worry about taking it away from
30:30 anyone else South America maybe Africa
30:34 they don't worry about that they they
30:36 want to form their big UN army and
30:37 they're just gonna roll over those
30:39 continents in two seconds if they can't
30:42 buy off the leaders to take the weapons
30:44 away from their people in the first
30:45 place which they can they'll just roll
30:47 over anybody's left but now guns are
30:49 part of like this heavily restricted
30:52 thing because it takes away power from
30:55 the bankers so now what is the next
30:59 weapon the next weapon is information
31:05 and information comes in several
31:07 different forms doesn't it the three
31:09 most popular forms of information we
31:11 today in 2019 the 21st century is text
31:15 audio and video the other kind of
31:20 low-end combination our images but text
31:25 gets to communicate a complete paradigm
31:27 of thinking a shift that could either go
31:29 for or against those that are trying to
31:32 control the world audio is very powerful
31:35 because audio is kind of like a human
31:37 fingerprint our voices are all unique as
31:42 much as they might be similar they are
31:43 unique video well jeez depending on how
31:48 the video is being represented it's very
31:51 telling sometimes of who did what where
31:54 when and how you get to see it the
31:58 images the reason why I kind of pushed
31:59 them into their own little annex off to
32:02 the side is that they can be easily
32:04 constructed and manipulated and it's a
32:06 lot more difficult but they are also
32:08 very powerful which is why when the
32:10 image and the text are coming together
32:12 to make something called a meme it is
32:14 one of the most powerful methods to
32:16 figure out or one of the most powerful
32:18 methods to pass around to help people
32:20 figure out those paradigm shifts who's
32:23 guilty who's not etc for the first
32:26 several years of the internet when
32:28 someone made an image of say Abraham
32:30 Lincoln and then they would put a quote
32:32 off to the side and say Abraham Lincoln
32:34 said this and they might give you a year
32:36 a time a place whatever we believed it
32:41 initially how are we to look up and find
32:47 out whether or not this was false it was
32:51 very difficult now it's a lot easier and
32:54 we know that virtually every brilliant
32:56 person who's been quoted in a meme has
32:58 had at least one quote about them that
33:00 is fake so now let's say that they take
33:04 this deep fake thing to level 10
33:09 we have people being accused of crimes
33:12 on purpose with fake on purpose created
33:16 videos and then they get into a court of
33:21 law and on purpose they discover the
33:23 fact that they're fake
33:25 and this happens two or three times in
33:27 super high-profile cases and they even
33:30 orchestrate on their end of the deal
33:31 that they believed it - I'll give an
33:35 example take one of the politicians in
33:38 the Democratic super PAC let's let you
33:40 pick I won't even say a name and that
33:43 person is CG in two like they take their
33:47 face and their voice take a bunch of
33:49 things they've said in the past or maybe
33:50 it's not even something where they need
33:51 to speak and they portray them doing
33:55 something that they never did
33:56 or maybe something they did do but in
33:59 this particular case it's a fake so this
34:03 goes through the courts and it is it is
34:07 dismissed in the eyes of the people and
34:09 then a second one and then a third one
34:10 maybe there's a politician that goes
34:12 first as a Hollywood producer goes
34:15 second and some other corporate shill
34:18 goes third maybe it's even a some royal
34:20 family member gets dragged into this and
34:23 they're gonna do it in America they'll
34:26 do it in Great Britain they'll do one in
34:28 probably Australia one in Europe so all
34:31 the sectors of the modern world get a
34:35 little taste of this this deception
34:37 mechanism and again if that's the case
34:40 you're gonna see deep fake everywhere
34:43 during this cycle so now think about it
34:48 they run through all these cases
34:50 intentionally [ __ ] up the quality of
34:52 information that we have out there such
34:54 that again when someone brings you a red
34:56 hot red handed photo our video of
34:59 someone doing something or an audio clip
35:01 of someone saying something you can't
35:04 trust it anymore and let's say that they
35:08 dramatize this up to a point where you
35:12 know people really were hurt they may
35:14 even take someone like an AOC or someone
35:17 and just not tell them because they're
35:19 abject morons to begin with and see you
35:21 drag them through court you ruin their
35:23 life or a couple years of course they've
35:25 got a big prize after the whole thing is
35:27 over maybe the person is in on it maybe
35:29 they're not be better if they weren't
35:31 because all the reactions would be
35:33 genuine and then they write a piece of
35:36 legislation
35:38 probably won't happen in America first
35:41 could could happen in America first and
35:44 what do they do they demonize
35:46 information and they put sanctions on
35:50 how information is distributed but more
35:54 threatening and more tyrannical they
35:59 start putting sanctions on software that
36:01 can accomplish these tasks and saying
36:03 well if you want to be a 3d artist
36:06 you're gonna have to get a government
36:07 certified pass because you could mess
36:11 with reality you could make people panic
36:14 you could do a UFO somewhere you could
36:17 do again a person talking and saying
36:21 something with an impersonator that even
36:24 if it's pretty obvious it's a fake it
36:26 could create a level of hysteria in the
36:28 real world that you're a threat to
36:32 national security or a threat to society
36:34 as a whole again let's review a couple
36:38 things is it legal to go into a theater
36:41 whether it be a play or a movie theater
36:45 and scream fire now nobody does this but
36:49 they used to do it every once in a while
36:50 I guess I don't know if they were idiots
36:52 or just pulling a gag but the stampede
36:55 of getting out of a theater got people
36:57 killed at one point and this became very
37:00 illegal
37:04 it's an ancient thing is it okay for you
37:09 to brandish your weapon you got a weapon
37:12 and has no rounds in it at all
37:15 but you drive down the highway and
37:17 everyone who pisses you off you wave it
37:21 at them and you scare them you know some
37:24 people I think most people would
37:26 probably swerve their car to get away
37:30 from that person in a way that would be
37:31 so sudden that they could kill
37:33 themselves kill their people and the
37:36 person brandishing the weapon gets to
37:40 drive home and and laugh it off if
37:42 there's such if there you know that
37:44 level of a sociopath right and so that's
37:48 why we have laws against doing those
37:50 things
37:52 framing people in general there's plenty
37:54 of laws against that sort of thing
37:56 already we don't need to pass new laws
37:58 but if we have a whole new breed of
38:02 fakery out there there could be a
38:05 gigantic problem now what I always find
38:07 interesting and most gun enthusiasts and
38:10 again all that means is you fired a gun
38:12 you learned how to use one you use it
38:15 sensibly you lock it up sensibly it
38:18 never becomes an option with disputes
38:21 you know you can have a spousal dispute
38:23 a neighbor dispute and you never ever
38:26 think about the fact you even own one
38:28 that's a responsible gun owner however
38:34 someone breaks into your house there's
38:35 an earthquake there's a hurricane you
38:37 can't keep your house shut there's
38:39 looting going on house to house and you
38:42 are there to protect your wares that's
38:45 where a second Amendment person like you
38:47 know hunker down okay but we do have
38:53 some crazies out there and they go out
38:55 and they use weapons in ways they're not
38:57 supposed to use it and this doesn't have
38:58 to be a big gigantic massacre this could
39:01 just be someone going into a liquor
39:04 store and using it for no reason it
39:08 happens all the time it's horrific
39:10 people who are willing to give them
39:12 everything get shot before they even
39:17 know that they have been asked to give
39:19 anything over I just watched a video
39:21 last night where a poor guy was in a
39:23 subway I don't know where he was what
39:26 country he was but some guy went up to
39:29 him I don't it wasn't even a subway but
39:31 he pointed a gun at him
39:32 guy had a backpack and he pointed the
39:36 gun and said give me your backpack and
39:38 the guy kind of okay and then as soon as
39:41 the guy grabbed the backpack the dude
39:42 instinctively reached down to grab it
39:45 back and the guy popped him in the head
39:47 and he was dead and the D ran off with
39:50 what maybe a couple thousand dollars
39:52 worth of hardware guarantee ain't
39:55 nothing in my backpack worth my life
39:56 there's nothing in my pockets worth my
39:59 life ever you want my [ __ ] there it is
40:02 buddy don't confuse me
40:04 standing here with being resistant
40:06 because I ain't resistant I don't even
40:09 know if there's any possessions in my
40:11 life besides human human friendships and
40:14 family that I would you know fight to
40:16 the death over okay
40:20 but they use those let's just say they
40:22 use that that simple thought process to
40:25 say look we don't allow you to brandish
40:29 weapons we don't allow you to call fire
40:31 we don't allow you to frame people they
40:36 drag a bunch of people through court you
40:38 see the pain and then and they could
40:40 just do a random stranger off the street
40:43 I mean it could be some horrific little
40:45 lawsuit that goes on for a long time and
40:48 so as they create these either
40:53 well it'll be it'll be a fake as they
40:55 create these fake pieces of evidence
40:58 with various types of software the
41:00 software will start to become a
41:02 registered weapon and so you'll have to
41:05 register your use and then every time
41:07 you launch the package you know I'm just
41:09 going to give you a fictitious
41:10 example of how this could be in 10 20
41:12 years but imagine in order to launch the
41:15 software your computer has to be locked
41:18 shut it has to shake hands over the
41:21 internet with some government server you
41:24 can't you can't do anything and if you
41:26 use the product they have complete right
41:29 to watch you use the product every time
41:31 you hit save they have to get a copy of
41:34 it if you create a picture they get to
41:36 have a copy of it it starts to lock down
41:39 Photoshop starts lock down Maya and 3d
41:42 studio max and blender 3d and any other
41:44 Terrigen product out there nuke
41:49 everything everything they can create
41:51 digital photography or movies or special
41:54 effects becomes a threat to society
41:58 well how many times a day out of every
42:02 convenience store and every human being
42:03 out of these eight billion roughly that
42:05 we have on this planet run out and
42:07 commit these crimes that I just noted
42:09 these ridiculous crimes or any
42:10 derivative thereof sure there's tens of
42:13 thousands in a day but that's a fraction
42:16 of a fraction of a percent
42:18 but who has to pay the price in the name
42:21 of our freedom because they did those
42:24 things again it's really trying to stop
42:31 anyone resisting the control apparatus
42:34 but because it's also capable of being
42:38 filtered down to humanity it also can be
42:42 perceived as we need to get rid of guns
42:44 because they can be used to do this
42:46 thing but there's that old saying guns
42:48 don't kill people people kill people
42:49 right and then you have some people that
42:51 never held the gun in their life try to
42:54 suggest otherwise well of the Turkish
42:57 people that come to Tiananmen Square and
43:00 stab a bunch of local residents with
43:03 knifes whether or not they have a good
43:06 reason I don't know I don't think they
43:08 do it's not the way to solve the problem
43:10 you could ban nice you really could you
43:14 could drum that situation up it's a
43:16 legit situation I don't think it's an FF
43:18 it's legit thing and so then you can't
43:21 have nice in China well I've seen
43:24 Chinese food cooked a million times in
43:26 China on YouTube and they love butcher
43:29 knives and they have to cut their pork
43:30 and you know so what do you do do you
43:33 register every butcher knife and a
43:35 restaurant you can't you have to get out
43:37 of a lockbox it's got a big chain on it
43:39 yeah it's like you can only get it a few
43:41 feet away from the box to do your work
43:43 they can take it two levels of absolute
43:46 absurdity if we don't wake up and start
43:50 taking control over the absurdity it's
43:54 important in my opinion that we catch
43:56 those that have done things for real if
43:59 there are videos out there that are
44:01 legit we need to be able to see them and
44:05 again it's it's just like because a lot
44:07 of people will need jerking they go man
44:08 this stuff is so rancid that it would
44:11 truly disturb society and so we cannot
44:15 allow society to see these well I'm not
44:17 talking about putting them on cnn.com or
44:22 Fox news.com or any of these public
44:24 sites it might be that just like in the
44:27 real world we have police officers and
44:30 homicide detect
44:31 and corners and they have to go clean up
44:35 messes in this world people have hurt
44:37 themselves people accidentally hurt
44:38 themselves whatever and if we don't have
44:41 them then every time there's a car
44:42 accident there'll be a bunch of stuff on
44:44 the street no one's got the guts to go
44:46 over to clean it up or they may not
44:48 legally be able to do it right so we
44:50 have people that do things very
44:51 specifically so it may not ever be seen
44:57 by us because we don't have those
45:00 positions in the world to deal with that
45:02 information and it's not that they don't
45:04 think that we could see it and survive
45:05 but they don't want to no one has the
45:07 time to figure out whether or not the
45:09 soccer moms going to have PTSD after
45:13 seeing what Hilary might have done and
45:14 at lalita Island or Bill Clinton at
45:17 Lolita Island they may not have it it
45:19 may ruin their life forever
45:20 and quite frankly may ruin our lives but
45:23 we think we're tough enough to see it
45:24 until we see it and it's like oh my god
45:26 I can't unsee that again I shared on
45:30 this show in an episode that I have
45:32 retired that was called essentially the
45:36 17 moment where Anthony Weiner's
45:39 computer went analyzed by the New York
45:43 Police Department
45:45 somebody said within the police
45:48 department that some people took
45:50 retirement after seeing what was in the
45:51 insurance folder one of the spouses of
45:55 one of the people that saw it said that
45:58 their spouse is now in therapy having
46:03 seen what was in weiners insurance
46:05 folder we don't know if that's true that
46:08 came out that's what was one of the
46:10 elements that was rumored to be in the
46:12 folder was again brought up in the house
46:14 it was the house hearing may been a
46:17 Senate hearing with the Google CEO guy
46:20 first questions guys mouth he even
46:23 described it I was so shocked part of me
46:27 thinks it was described because it
46:29 exists and they're trying to put it into
46:31 the world of fiction already as quickly
46:34 as possible you see that it's not real I
46:37 would hope that the law enforcement DOJ
46:39 whoever is going to process that
46:42 information has a lot more information
46:44 than just
46:45 which then triangulates any piece of
46:49 blatant evidence like that into being
46:51 true meaning if a little girl was harmed
46:57 and killed in a extremely sick ritual
47:02 that we know who the girl was
47:05 we know that she was shipped to the
47:06 island and that she never came out of
47:08 that place alive and by a certain age
47:12 she didn't exist on the island that's
47:15 what we need to know all that
47:16 information at least the people that
47:19 would enforce such a crime and forced
47:23 the punishment on such a crime now what
47:26 happens in news today and there are
47:29 legal reasons for this so I understand
47:31 some of this but one of the reasons why
47:34 I agreed to do MKULTRA radio before this
47:37 show was that I was sick and tired of
47:41 red-handed things being referenced in
47:44 news as allegedly or a read hey a red
47:50 handed guilty person being called a
47:53 suspect we know for a fact that these
47:56 things occurred based on the evidence
47:58 that we have discovered I mean it's
48:00 crazy you would see you know Joe Biden
48:04 doesn't allegedly touch girls on c-span
48:07 he did touch girls on c-span he touched
48:10 them in ways that in several areas of
48:12 the world Joe would be dead if the
48:16 fathers really figured out what occurred
48:18 and he wasn't it wouldn't even matter if
48:20 he was a politician or whatever it would
48:22 take the Secret Service everything
48:24 they've got to keep this guy alive but
48:26 it wasn't revealed because everyone's
48:28 looking the other way because we have
48:30 these too-big-to-fail sort of things too
48:33 big to be incarcerated things we've got
48:34 laws you know maybe maybe they're you
48:38 know there is this thing that Muller
48:39 tried to throw out when what a piece of
48:41 [ __ ] this guy's goddamn yeah it's really
48:44 weird it's really strange I just want to
48:46 say like we talked I talked about it
48:48 recently in a video where you know
48:50 people with Hitler's last name have a
48:52 hard time in some areas of the world of
48:54 course but I think people with the name
48:57 Comey
48:59 Muller all these names it's gonna be it
49:02 should be tough to have that name after
49:04 what these scumbags did and just the
49:06 weenie [ __ ] lies these guys told but
49:08 he was basically going up and saying I
49:11 couldn't he said he couldn't he couldn't
49:15 announce that he had found a crime
49:17 against Trump because there's a law that
49:21 says you can't charge an acting
49:25 president with the crime when that's a
49:28 complete lie yes you can't charge a
49:33 acting president with the crime outright
49:35 you know but what do you think
49:37 impeachment is do you find the crime you
49:42 announced it to the world and you say
49:44 hey world
49:46 I can't charge this guy with this crime
49:48 because he's currently the president so
49:50 I'm gonna hand it over to the house to
49:53 evaluate the crime and I'm gonna have
49:56 the house impeach him on the crime but
50:00 even this Nadler piece-of-shit guy he's
50:04 talking about impeachment but we're all
50:05 waiting for what crime do you have crime
50:10 crime like you can like anyone else in
50:13 the normal world will go to jail for it
50:15 nothing zero it's a big nothing
50:18 burger you know how many times in
50:21 history has man achieved a level of
50:24 freedom either through you know jumping
50:26 over an ocean and creating places like
50:27 America or again getting Magna Carta
50:31 signed or growing up in some Egyptian
50:34 utopia no one's lying to each other and
50:38 no one's you know believing that crime
50:40 is a way to live and Babylonia seems
50:43 like it was one of those places - way
50:45 back in the day but even they wrote in
50:48 their history books sort of fables of
50:53 their politicians and their controllers
50:56 getting corrupt and then every 300 so
50:59 years you know replacing those
51:01 individuals with good people and then it
51:03 was just a matter of a cycle before they
51:05 got corrupt and it was interesting that
51:07 we didn't learn from that but how many
51:08 times have you talked to an older person
51:12 and they'll say
51:12 you know back in my day we didn't have
51:14 this kind of stuff but now we do never
51:18 would have thought we wouldn't be able
51:19 to own gold I mean ask anybody and these
51:22 people are no longer with us probably in
51:24 any sentient way but anybody who was a
51:27 grown up in the 1920s who when Roosevelt
51:32 sold us out to the bankers and seized
51:37 the gold in America by 1934 and shipped
51:40 it off to you no Fort Knox supposedly
51:42 who would have thought that that was
51:44 even possible this is my sovereign
51:46 [ __ ] property man this ain't yours
51:48 don't give me your shitty [ __ ] fiat
51:50 pay paper currency
51:52 I got gold baby this stuff doesn't lose
51:54 value your paper loses value you give me
51:58 my paper worth of that gold and then you
52:00 can do whatever you want with your paper
52:01 that's what happened who would have ever
52:05 thought in the late 30s that they were
52:07 about to do a an FF to do Pearl Harbor
52:10 it's it's a matter of the history books
52:13 now who would have ever thought they
52:16 would have been able to do it for
52:17 Vietnam to start that war a fake event
52:20 to fake events that never happened but
52:23 that's the way we started a war
52:25 senseless
52:26 ridiculous war with no positivity for
52:30 our side and we're just pawns in the
52:34 game man it's like Black Sabbath songs
52:38 war pigs man we're just pawns in chess
52:41 until we perceive ourselves as true
52:45 sovereign beings that have equal power
52:47 if you work for a newspaper for instance
52:51 and you're a writer you have research
52:54 teams you have legal teams you've got
52:56 your editor over you making sure you
52:58 don't write about things that well
53:01 they're the true initial purpose was to
53:04 make sure that whatever was published in
53:06 the rag whether it be a magazine or
53:07 newspaper was actually interesting
53:09 enough the people would want to buy the
53:10 newspaper for that was the major goal of
53:12 it but if you're going to cite or Accu
53:16 someone of something you needed to have
53:18 a research team a legal team they have
53:19 to look over what you're saying because
53:22 they have to make sure you're not
53:24 falsely accusing some
53:26 of something and then they come back on
53:27 the newspaper for defamation and they
53:29 sue you for millions of bucks now we
53:32 know that tabloids do this all the time
53:35 but what they do is no mystery to anyone
53:38 but they will actually go to a law firm
53:40 and their legal team internally and
53:43 they'll say we're gonna do this fake
53:45 story on somebody Brad Pitt had a lot of
53:49 this on him we're gonna report this
53:51 thing about Brad Pitt and it's all fake
53:53 but you know what I think we're gonna be
53:56 able to sell you know 10 million issues
54:00 of this I don't know what that inquiry
54:03 costs I don't know but they make 50
54:06 million dollars off this story this
54:07 cover story
54:09 this fake accusation and they know the
54:13 law firm says what he's probably be able
54:14 see for sure if he's if he goes for it
54:17 it's gonna probably cost us a couple of
54:21 million dollars to fight it in court
54:22 we're definitely gonna dream his side
54:24 but he's probably gonna get us for his
54:25 his attorney fees as well and he's gonna
54:27 get a settlement from us we're gonna be
54:30 able to buy him off on the side and you
54:32 know it'll make us look bad for six days
54:34 and then no one gives us any more
54:36 because it's the Inquirer but they will
54:39 have made this is all fictitious of
54:41 course but they may have found a way to
54:43 make forty five million dollars off that
54:45 issue pay him two or three million
54:49 dollars to be quiet pay off the
54:51 attorneys fees which might be another
54:52 two or three million dollars maybe
54:55 they're out five to ten million bucks
54:56 maybe in a worst case scenario they have
54:58 to pay out like thirty five million
55:00 dollars but that cover story sold fifty
55:03 million dollars worth of paper and ink
55:06 all right
55:07 sounds like a business to me doesn't it
55:10 at no point does the newspaper ever get
55:13 shut all the way down at no point does
55:16 anyone get fired so there's all kinds of
55:20 methodologies to report fake stuff and
55:22 lie and get away with it to control
55:26 people the paparazzi are there to
55:30 control the apparatus of teenee Bob
55:34 control over Tina Bob minds so
55:38 I've said this before I keep repeating
55:41 it I never see it discussed in the
55:43 Facebook group because it's a high-end
55:46 concept the back in the Greek theater
55:48 days they had it opened up for
55:52 entertainment first then someone started
55:54 writing like typology plays about the
56:00 current leadership in Greece exposing
56:06 the fact that they had corrupt leaders
56:08 and plays have been at least written in
56:11 the history books as being responsible
56:13 at times for uprisings and the
56:15 replacements of the government's from
56:17 changing complete paradigms of how they
56:18 run their country and eventually the
56:21 politicians figured this out and started
56:24 killing the playwrights and started
56:27 killing anybody participated in acting
56:30 out place that would hurt them in the
56:33 paradigm perception of the people and
56:36 this kept all the way up through Rome if
56:39 you any of you watch the remake of Romeo
56:43 and Juliet with Glen if winneth Paltrow
56:47 there was the thing that this
56:49 Shakespeare guy was probably Francis
56:52 Bacon but he had to put all of his
56:55 scripts through the Royal you know
56:59 offices to make sure that they weren't
57:01 gonna hurt the queen or the king
57:04 probably King at that time can't
57:07 remember some of you might remember the
57:10 series on TV called the crown and it's
57:15 about Queen Elizabeth and the whole
57:18 family Charles Prince Philip Francis
57:22 died all those people and they have
57:26 talked about the fact that in Britain
57:28 those scripts are written they're sent
57:31 over to the Buckingham Palace or
57:34 wherever and they are mulled over by
57:38 quote-unquote historians in in PR people
57:41 that work for the Queen
57:42 to ensure that even though they're gonna
57:45 you know insinuate some things about the
57:48 Queen that weren't that flattering but
57:50 they have to
57:52 could kick it up with an uptick at the
57:54 end that says but she overcame that and
57:57 that's why she's your queen and one of
58:00 the things that they one of the arcs
58:01 that they put through which I thought
58:02 was amazing that I got made was that
58:04 they said that at one point she wasn't
58:08 that smart and the actress the Placer is
58:11 phenomenal but they said that she wasn't
58:14 that smart and that she took it into her
58:16 own hands to become intelligent member
58:19 they didn't want to go to Africa and
58:20 represent the dynasty and then she had a
58:24 sister who was a baller who had the same
58:28 kind of thing she was really good with
58:29 people but she was also very free spirit
58:31 and say they were always trying to
58:33 control things so it still happens to
58:36 this day I have been told as a writer in
58:40 Hollywood that you know if I'm to write
58:44 say the Eiffel Tower into my script or
58:48 some other Taj Mahal or something that
58:51 the governments of those countries have
58:54 exclusive rights on how those entities
58:57 are portrayed in my scripts then I'm not
59:01 allowed I know how you can demonize
59:03 those structures but they don't want
59:05 certain things to happen in their
59:06 structures like if I were to probably
59:09 write something was like okay you know
59:12 the Eiffel Tower is gigantic great and
59:14 if I said okay inside one of the mid
59:16 tiers of the Eiffel Tower is a speakeasy
59:19 where a bunch of nasty stuff happened
59:21 they probably wouldn't allow it because
59:24 they don't want anyone to perceive this
59:25 tower as being anything other than what
59:27 it is that makes sense you wouldn't want
59:30 anything to anyone to say something
59:33 about about whatever monument the United
59:34 States that you prize
59:36 I personally fear that the deep fake can
59:41 turn into a complete control apparatus
59:44 on top of how information is generated
59:47 in this world believe me they want you
59:50 to be sweating in your palms as a blog
59:53 writer with this perceived First
59:56 Amendment the reason why winched in the
59:59 newspapers and how they do their thing
60:01 is that they know that a blogger can say
60:04 whatever they want
60:05 you know there's defamation laws and all
60:08 the laws that we have on the books and
60:10 you they still apply to a blogger but
60:13 they know that there's a lot of exposure
60:17 that's been going on for the last twenty
60:20 years it really started blowing up but
60:22 things like loose change would never
60:26 have been allowed to be made if they had
60:28 total control over the insinuations of
60:31 that film if you haven't seen it shame
60:34 on you go see it you'll see the very
60:36 very first one released in 2005 don't
60:38 look at all the remakes and the because
60:40 they scrubbed it they scrubbed it down I
60:44 having paid attention to everything I
60:46 paid attention to and especially this
60:48 technology that's coming out that's
60:50 fueling the deep fake movement a lot of
60:54 things that they said in that first
60:55 version were real and they they back
60:57 down because they were kids and you know
60:59 you got a you gotta think things through
61:02 if you haven't lived your life and you
61:04 haven't had your kids and your family
61:06 and you got a bunch of black suits on
61:08 your doorstep saying if you don't change
61:11 this and we will help you change it make
61:13 you look like you're still independent
61:15 but you know you're gonna be under our
61:16 thumb for the rest of your life you're
61:17 gonna be surveyed for the rest of your
61:19 life you better be good you know unlit
61:23 early they probably sit down and just go
61:25 look you made your mark okay kids you
61:26 did your thing yeah yeah yeah so you
61:30 know when you're out there by your so
61:31 when you're out there by yourself
61:32 thinking about things in your backyard
61:34 just yeah you got us you know this on
61:37 the chin just be thankful we're not
61:39 being told to liquidate you so just go
61:43 about your life be quiet
61:45 and the kids do what they got to do
61:48 maybe we do the same thing you never
61:52 know man how many times have you guys
61:55 walked into a place where you just
61:57 didn't feel safe or even more subtle you
62:03 didn't feel invited you filled out a
62:06 place I went into a bar in Sydney
62:13 Australia it was interesting I was
62:15 trying to find a decent drink I don't
62:17 drink much but I had a bit
62:18 and I was just like you know let's just
62:20 see what it's like went into this bar
62:23 took me forever to find a bar that
62:25 served alcohol it was strange that it
62:28 wasn't full of like a ton of hipsters
62:29 and you know wasn't like again that was
62:32 their kind so it was like walking into
62:34 the [ __ ] Cantina and tanta Wien and I
62:38 was a robot what do you I found a place
62:40 and it looked like a bunch of people my
62:42 age and they were chewing up some sports
62:44 show or something like that and I went
62:47 in and probably got the worst old
62:50 fashioned I've ever been served in my
62:52 life or a ridiculously high price it was
62:55 seriously the worst drink of it's like
62:57 they didn't understand what the drink
62:59 was or whatever it was bad but they
63:00 poured so much ice in this drink that
63:03 four sips and I was done I was like oh
63:05 that's $15 I'm not in an airport man I'm
63:08 downtown Sydney you know I guess I was
63:11 supposed to drink beer that was the
63:13 thing going around most the time but
63:14 they want to be able to create that
63:18 atmosphere around you on your phone they
63:22 want to be able to make you feel like
63:23 that in your living room in your office
63:25 wherever you're doing your social media
63:28 because and this is no this is no
63:31 surprise to any of you the conformity
63:34 pressure is huge you know I get it all
63:39 the time as being the host of this show
63:40 I get you know flat earth conformity
63:42 conversations going people you know it's
63:47 you know basically telling me if I don't
63:49 believe what they believe
63:51 then they're gonna unsub or or whatever
63:56 you know mark all my videos down or
63:59 whatever and it's like knock yourself
64:00 out - you were hardly any pressure for
64:03 me trust me but then I've got other
64:05 people that are fantastic about it and
64:07 they approach me very intelligently and
64:10 they say you know if I'm able to conduct
64:13 this experiment and get the result that
64:15 would otherwise prove that it's not what
64:18 you think it is round versus flat or
64:20 whatever would you believe me and man
64:22 those are the best kind of conversations
64:25 you can get into and that's one reason
64:27 why I think that if you believe in
64:29 something that's completely different
64:30 and you're being called a conspiracy
64:32 a person you know I think one of the
64:37 things we would want to do is make sure
64:38 that we do all of our research that we
64:41 can and again I just did an episode on
64:45 gravity for deniers and I know it's kind
64:48 of a sort of a sketchy kind of episode
64:52 for my channel because there's a lot of
64:54 folks that have issues with it but I've
64:57 been getting responses and there's a
64:59 bunch of great responses one person
65:02 replied and said air pressure makes
65:06 sense gravity doesn't and right there I
65:12 can tell you that within the first I
65:14 don't know two or three months of high
65:16 school physics they'll teach you that if
65:17 you vacuum a chamber of any pressure and
65:22 you put a feather in there before you
65:23 start the experiment the feather still
65:26 Falls perfectly fine falls a little
65:28 faster because there's no air resistance
65:30 whatsoever but there's no pressure in
65:32 there and gravity exists inside the cube
65:35 gravity is not air pressure that is air
65:38 pressure contribute to gravity well sure
65:40 absolutely what do you think why do you
65:43 think you fall to the bottom of the
65:44 ocean when you go down below what is it
65:46 thirty five seventy feet somewhere in
65:47 that realm you'll go right to the bottom
65:49 the ocean air and water are basically
65:52 the same exact liquid behavior and so
65:56 yeah I've got miles of oxygen above me
65:59 now it's flowing all over the place but
66:02 it is contributing to me being pushed
66:03 down if the atmosphere suddenly
66:05 disappeared on earth I'm assuming we
66:09 would feel a little bit lighter but for
66:12 the most part we we wouldn't float into
66:14 space now that would have to be a slow
66:16 process right because if you vacuum it
66:18 off we're probably sucked up with the
66:20 vacuum but just in a pure sense if it
66:22 would all float away for some reason we
66:25 feel a little lighter but now what's the
66:27 world gonna be like after this stuff
66:29 turns on what's it gonna turn into well
66:35 you'll find out there's a lot of
66:38 methodology about how I've created my
66:41 episodes not so much in the in the past
66:44 although my past
66:45 says in season one or very benign
66:49 self-help self-improvement episodes
66:52 those aren't gonna be a victim of much
66:54 but if I were to express my opinion in a
66:59 for a lack of organized religion maybe
67:02 there's a little church thing that comes
67:05 in there and says well you're hurting
67:07 people's feelings and [ __ ] the whole
67:08 world start into a feeling joint and
67:14 you're gonna have you know we're banning
67:16 your video we're taking it offline you
67:19 could have written an article a long
67:20 time ago mentioning a particular
67:22 person's name and saying how much
67:24 they're horrible I do it all the time on
67:25 the show right and it'll be illegal they
67:30 could scrub all the videos off
67:31 everyone's cloud storage they could you
67:35 know your operating systems could one
67:37 day scrape it off your hard drives off
67:39 your DVRs so there's certain pieces of
67:42 empirical evidence we have like Joe
67:44 Biden touching girls what if they got
67:46 rid of all of his videos off your hard
67:48 drives off your RAM sticks there's some
67:51 E&P event or whatever and they know it
67:53 just doesn't exist anymore and so now if
67:55 you talk about those events they know
67:57 that there's no proof that you're
67:59 telling the truth anymore except for
68:01 people's memories in their minds I and
68:04 there you go they've completely
68:06 restructured the memory of society so
68:12 when you write an article
68:13 the second you try to publish it maybe
68:16 it goes through some AI bots that goes
68:18 nope you can't you can't publish this
68:21 article you said these words and maybe
68:24 on a fringy case they say okay we think
68:28 you've said something that's not allowed
68:29 so we're propagating your article to a
68:31 human being that you're gonna have to
68:33 pay for and if it falls through all
68:37 these processes then you can get your
68:41 article published completely controlled
68:45 remember rollerball 1975
68:48 Jonathan EE tries to find out how to
68:50 executive decisions decisions are made
68:52 tries to check out books from the
68:54 library about executive decisions he
68:57 gives to the librarian which is really
68:58 not alive
68:59 more receptionist as she says well all
69:02 of the books that you are asking for
69:04 have been paraphrased in the corporate
69:05 database which you have access to at
69:07 your house why don't you just look that
69:10 up and he's like I don't want that I
69:12 want the truth right I'm sorry and he
69:15 goes you're not a librarian no and there
69:18 really are no books no so he goes to
69:21 Geneva to try and find the truth from a
69:24 supercomputer it finds out that the
69:26 gentleman said we lost the 12th century
69:28 this morning what is one of the major
69:31 problems we have with being on earth
69:33 today we don't know where we came from
69:37 we don't oh you can have belief systems
69:40 about where you came from you could
69:42 believe we were dropped off by aliens
69:43 you could believe that Jesus Christ was
69:45 real and God made us just 4,500 years
69:47 ago you could believe in evolution in
69:51 the Big Bang but you have no proof of
69:53 any of that stuff being real oh you can
69:57 interpret data to give yourself a bump I
69:59 do it you do it they do it we're all
70:03 trying to figure that out but now we
70:06 look back and we say well it makes sense
70:08 that man doesn't have the really old
70:12 pass because there was no storage
70:14 devices there were only a few written
70:17 languages you know the sumerian mud
70:20 tablets are pretty fragile
70:22 they're also impossible to carbon-date
70:24 so someone could have written a bunch of
70:26 that stuff and submit it as truth they
70:30 could do one right next to one that's
70:32 real and you know that muds gonna edge
70:34 to mud you know you won't be able to
70:36 determine how old it is I want to do an
70:40 episode on carbon dating I've gone down
70:42 that rabbit hole a couple times I need
70:44 to do that again because I've completely
70:45 forgot what the dispute is about that
70:50 but is there any excuse for us losing
70:54 modern history you know since Roman
71:00 times they have been writing stuff down
71:02 feverishly you know we know that
71:04 previous civilizations have written you
71:07 know the Greeks did really good job you
71:09 know there's tons of Egyptian stuff and
71:11 Babylonian stuff and Chinese stuff
71:13 and so on and so forth but you know once
71:16 the printing press really came around
71:17 history was fairly well documented but
71:20 obviously when the printing press
71:22 reached like the 1700s 1800s things were
71:25 immaculately documented but then we had
71:27 yellow journalism coming in America and
71:29 really screw everything up
71:32 then we had propaganda newspapers
71:35 televisions magazines mocking the
71:38 Mockingbird project which was literally
71:40 designed to destroy the integrity of
71:42 information your perception of yourself
71:44 and your country and history and who's
71:47 your enemies was all controlled this
71:50 deep fake thing is threatening the very
71:55 next level of integrity it is being
71:58 pushed out there for the reason to make
72:01 sure that whatever comes down the pike
72:02 pike is perceived as unreliable when
72:07 perhaps it is absolutely a hundred
72:10 percent the proof that you need to put
72:12 people away in jail forever to keep the
72:14 evil away from your children to keep the
72:18 evil away from your economy and your
72:20 education now I want to take you down a
72:24 small path as we close this episode out
72:26 because it's something I think about
72:28 every once in a while I might have
72:30 mentioned it one episode out of 400 but
72:35 the big question is this is it possible
72:39 to simply join them give them everything
72:42 that they wanted give them your guns
72:45 give them your freedom of speech give
72:47 them their big giant world army let them
72:52 go through with their two hundred to ten
72:54 thousand year plan do everything that
72:56 Huxley talked about everything that 1984
73:00 warned us against and somehow we're
73:03 going to end up with a utopian world I
73:05 think that the number one reason why
73:07 most of us you know puke in our mouth a
73:10 little bit when we think about that is
73:13 that we know that there has never been a
73:15 sense of generosity empathy sympathy
73:19 towards man since we've been alive when
73:23 it comes to the individuals that are
73:25 truly considered
73:26 ruling-class the only time we experience
73:29 these things in a fluidity that is
73:32 palatable is that we have our parents
73:36 our grandparents our friends people who
73:39 run great mom-and-pop stores or
73:41 companies that's when you see things go
73:45 right and believe me they understand
73:48 that for the very first time in my
73:51 forest research by going to my lounge
73:54 we're starting to see some mainstream
73:57 articles about individuals that work for
73:59 Google becoming disgruntled and starting
74:03 to reveal some of this stuff that's been
74:05 hidden internally and Apple went through
74:07 this as well I think a lot of companies
74:08 go through this but they've reached a
74:10 critical mass where they're unable to
74:12 keep everyone happy and so you know
74:16 ubers going through it uber just reduced
74:18 their drivers pay by 25% I mean that's
74:22 so much money I've had a ton of my
74:25 friends that used to drive for uber stop
74:27 driving for uber because they sanction
74:29 the uber driver down to 12 hours with
74:31 the brake forced in the center which I
74:33 don't think it's necessarily a bad idea
74:35 because I don't I don't want to fall on
74:37 asleep or anything but now they're
74:39 reducing their pay and they're reducing
74:41 their pay because lyft went public and
74:43 now eibar wants to go public and your
74:45 public evaluation is based on how much
74:46 money you generate versus how much money
74:48 you save Google did the same thing when
74:50 they went public they did the I think it
74:53 was called the November updated October
74:55 update like it was November update and
74:56 they screwed with everyone's organic
74:58 search it no longer works anymore you
75:00 have to have a campaign that you pay for
75:03 before your company's anywhere near the
75:06 first 10 pages of search results meaning
75:09 you know you're gonna have to be buying
75:13 all of your customers from Google again
75:16 the way I always give you the analogy
75:17 because I had a bunch of people on
75:19 literally the number one slot on Yahoo
75:23 MSN search and Google search they were
75:26 at the tippy top in Orange County making
75:28 tons of cash we didn't pay a dime I just
75:32 built the site right indexed it right
75:34 but nowadays you could need a plumber
75:37 for your the [ __ ] that's all backed up
75:40 your house there's a plumber next door
75:42 to your house has his own business if
75:45 for whatever reason you don't know maybe
75:46 it's a block over so you don't see his
75:48 truck every day but you do a google
75:50 search now and they're gonna send you
75:52 off to some big giant plumbing company
75:54 that's gonna charge way more put you off
75:57 for two or three days do a shitty job at
76:00 it when the guy right across the street
76:03 could do it for you but he can't get his
76:06 website to show up you know one of the
76:10 biggest things going on
76:12 it's probably their last few years of
76:14 life but Yelp Yelp has a problem that
76:17 they one that you trust what random
76:22 people say about a place is sort of nuts
76:24 you shouldn't but when you open a new
76:27 restaurant or a new service you know
76:29 brick-and-mortar location you obviously
76:31 can get a yelp entry and someone can
76:33 create a yelp interview for you or you
76:35 can create one for yourself and then
76:37 everybody takes all their relatives and
76:39 friends and says go to a five-star thing
76:41 they give away desserts if you can prove
76:43 you did a five-star review or whatever
76:44 they're not supposed to do but they do
76:46 and so they got five stars for a little
76:48 while and the public starts going and
76:51 finding out it's not five stars but then
76:53 you get these one star ratings and one
76:55 star ratings are like what did they do
76:57 to you I mean they set you on fire I
76:58 mean again it's a little absurd the
77:01 people that you really want to check out
77:03 are your friends and family did your
77:04 friends and family go there did they
77:06 like it because they're like you you
77:08 guys go to restaurants together all the
77:10 time anyway so if your buddy likes it
77:12 you might like it they haven't figured
77:13 that out yet but they do a couple things
77:16 they they will actually call up a
77:17 merchant and say you know we want you to
77:20 buy some advertising from us and then
77:22 we'll help you get rid of some of these
77:23 bad reviews on your site like it if
77:26 anyone uses Rachael's racial slurs or
77:28 anything like that or they fail to
77:30 really make a case for anything that's
77:32 really going on at the location then
77:34 those can get purged automatically which
77:36 is nice it's a different it's a nice
77:38 upgrade but a lot of my friends around
77:40 these businesses and they're like look
77:42 it's not bothering me with your ads your
77:45 business your little apparatus there is
77:47 the reason why I don't have customers
77:49 because the competition we had two
77:52 Peruvian restaurants go out of here in
77:54 honey to beach it's kind of interesting
77:56 one of the chefs the way the story went
77:58 this is one of the owners telling me one
78:00 of the chefs didn't like where he worked
78:02 he was at the older Peruvian restaurant
78:04 so he loves cooking Peruvian food he's a
78:08 master at it so he came over to the one
78:10 that's closer to me and so the other one
78:13 found out there's no legal poaching laws
78:17 or anything
78:18 he has 100% right to change his employer
78:22 they started getting all their customers
78:24 to do one stars on the one that was
78:26 close by and I assure you there was
78:29 nothing you could order nor any
78:30 experience that you could get at that
78:32 location that would be one star it just
78:34 can't guarantee it the other word one is
78:37 I helped a buddy of mine it was just me
78:41 being a pedestrian he had it he has a
78:43 car repair place I used to use him all
78:45 the time for my old car and I created
78:48 him a Yelp entry because he didn't have
78:51 one because he's kind of he's tucked
78:52 away in a little industrial area nobody
78:54 knows exists the people come are not
78:56 really LP kind of people but I wanted
78:57 him to be on the list when someone looks
78:59 up cart repair or restoration I wanted
79:02 at least be a part of the game inside
79:04 created him zone Yelp thing these little
79:06 submission things long as you have an
79:07 account you're logged in you can create
79:09 a business entry for someone now it's
79:12 been almost ten years since I did that
79:14 and now I getting calls on my phone I'm
79:19 getting emails from Yelp begging me to
79:23 buy advertising for this business and I
79:27 keep replying and telling them look I
79:28 don't have anything to do with that guy
79:29 anymore
79:30 I didn't have anything to do with him
79:31 really at the beginning I certainly
79:32 wouldn't put my money to advertise for
79:34 his business he's not interested in
79:37 doing it and so we have these weird
79:41 things that come about and I just fear
79:45 that no matter what we do we cannot get
79:51 our marching orders from these
79:52 Psychopaths there is no if you can't
79:56 beat them join them
79:57 that doesn't work it's it's I don't
80:00 think it's ever worked ever quite
80:01 frankly so keep your eyes peeled for all
80:05 these posts in social media
80:08 that are part of these you know deep
80:11 fake things where you're seeing again
80:16 there's this compilation of Obama giving
80:17 a speech with like I don't know eight
80:19 different faces and it was a speech he
80:22 gave I think in the 90s or something so
80:24 he's a really young man or at least the
80:27 use of those photographs of him talking
80:29 this could be the next coup on our
80:32 freedom and so I want us to think about
80:35 this you know again the show's entire
80:37 objective is to say when we get control
80:39 of this world which we will because old
80:42 people die just like Charlie Chaplin
80:44 said in his great American speech was
80:46 Great Dictator speech excuse me they die
80:49 we get to take over we have to stop our
80:52 children from becoming them meaning we
80:55 have to treat each other better as human
80:57 beings because that's what creates a
80:58 sociopath in the first place
81:00 if someone's awkward and a nerd you got
81:04 two choices shun them and then you
81:08 create them you create these people that
81:10 want to see the world burn or lean in
81:13 take some time out of your super popular
81:15 person schedule and have a conversation
81:18 with the human being that probably needs
81:20 it a hell of a lot more than anyone else
81:21 you're gonna talk to and yeah you may be
81:25 bored to death immediately you may be
81:27 offended who knows but that little bit
81:32 of humanity will train them humanities
81:35 good and let's have more conversations
81:38 with humanity and that person doesn't
81:40 know how to talk well doesn't know how
81:42 to not talk about politics and religion
81:44 well maybe calm down their rhetoric and
81:47 enjoy having more constructive
81:50 conversations I guess they'll totally
81:51 disagree with you they shouldn't
81:52 compromise their belief systems perhaps
81:54 they'll do a little more research
81:55 perhaps we'll find softer ways of saying
81:58 things and maybe they won't have the
81:59 conversation at all they'll just talk
82:01 about the weather so I want to get this
82:03 out season four before it's over because
82:06 I think it's gonna be a big summer item
82:08 while I'm on break if you have them into
82:13 deep thoughts radio calm please go it's
82:15 going to have all the links for the
82:16 video the audio the social media methods
82:19 to donate
82:20 and the link to the new remastered
82:22 season 1 until next time take care of
82:26 yourself and someone else and I'll see
82:28 in the next deep thoughts over now
