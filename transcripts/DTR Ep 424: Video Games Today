00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts today I thought we talk
00:36 about something that I think a lot of
00:38 you have intimate knowledge about and
00:41 intimate opinions intimate research
00:43 about before I start let me put a little
00:47 disclaimer near it's just my opinion
00:50 these l'p Lumos are really good little
00:53 sticks okay so your humble narrator got
00:58 into the video game business
00:59 professionally in 1989 drawing old
01:04 tile-based the first 256 color games out
01:08 there which I must sound absurdly
01:11 ancient but I was very young and managed
01:15 to manifest a bunch of talents before I
01:17 got professionally involved in high
01:19 school I was known even as a kid for
01:23 creating games great in my I drew my
01:26 first video game in binary and some of
01:28 you have already heard sorry I just want
01:30 to preface this because people in the
01:31 chart a you know they just need to know
01:35 right about 11:00 my uncle was the
01:39 programmer I was the illustrator he
01:41 taught me how to do it and so I took my
01:44 drawings I covered into binary blocks
01:45 and he stack him up and color them and
01:47 he could multi stack him if you wanted
01:49 to do a bunch of different colors and
01:51 then it was hooked I saw the movie Tron
01:54 right shortly after that and then I
01:56 started programming on a bunch of
02:01 different computers the Commodore 64 for
02:03 a little while until I realized that
02:05 computer was screwed than a trs-80 Coco
02:10 computer I'm in my I'm like 12 13 14
02:13 years old finally got into high school
02:14 sort of going to the college start
02:16 getting access to Apple two's first
02:19 access I had to one of those was in
02:22 junior high but I had a whiz kid friend
02:27 of mine named Keith and he gave me he
02:31 was much older than me maybe maybe like
02:33 five or six years older than me he was
02:35 giving me editors so I could take my
02:36 artwork
02:37 into sprites and then I studied how to
02:40 create sound waves and I ended up
02:43 creating before I came out of high
02:45 school I mean I create a bunch of like
02:46 his work type games where you would type
02:48 in and get you'd have to escape a
02:51 haunted house that was one of my
02:52 favorite themes and then I did a
02:56 multiplayer drag race game Top Fuel Drag
02:59 Race
03:00 so one players on top one players on
03:02 bottom and I did this little spitting
03:05 sound wave that I sped up and so it
03:08 really sound like the popping sounds of
03:11 a top fuel dragster puts little random
03:13 algorithms in there which is kind of
03:15 funny because I didn't really have much
03:17 knowledge about it you know I just loved
03:19 what they look like and so that you know
03:21 two of you would have two sides of the
03:23 keyboard pounding on it and so the other
03:27 thing was is I had a I was just obsessed
03:30 with drawing digitally and I was always
03:32 black and white and so once you master
03:34 black and white color digitally anyway
03:38 is a much better second act than a first
03:41 act because you start to learn you know
03:43 the geometry of pixels and odd stuff so
03:47 and I was drawing fonts professionally
03:49 and just just always digital this
03:51 digital icons and you know clipart for
03:53 programs that needed you know clip art
03:55 for logos and things like that hundreds
03:57 of logos by the time I got laid off from
04:01 the TurboTax folks I got a little job
04:05 working for a a company that so what you
04:10 have to understand about Activision is
04:11 their only distributor so they
04:14 distribute what other companies do it's
04:16 a brilliant model our company was called
04:18 atomic entertainment then renamed after
04:21 shock entertainment I drew for at least
04:25 two video games for them and but just a
04:29 ton of things like the realm package
04:31 which is the world when you look down on
04:32 it I did the sprite packages I mean I
04:34 had to do like Greek gods so imagine
04:38 Medusa out of the old Clash of the
04:40 Titans from the 80s with like a swimming
04:42 snake here and you know it was eight
04:45 different directions and so it was the
04:46 walking routines and then shooting
04:48 things and it's all by hand
04:49 there's no 3d modeling
04:51 you have to be an artist you have to
04:52 know how to animate I got really lucky
04:55 when I was 11 years old I think it was I
05:01 got put into the the Brockton art
05:06 museums animation workshop course so it
05:10 was like a little college course for
05:12 anybody of any age and you drew it all
05:14 by hand sell art and stuff like that so
05:17 I did an animation of piece from the
05:21 movie Wizards by Ralph Bakshi riding on
05:24 the back of that animal he rode and then
05:28 I ended up doing as a side project site
05:30 project I did a UFO flying down and
05:32 sapping a radar on top of a building I
05:34 was 11 years old whatever by 93 I
05:38 started contracting in Electronic Arts
05:39 in all different ways on the side we
05:42 were trying to create our first MMO with
05:44 one of my other two my other genius
05:46 friends and we had it all figured out
05:47 and then internally EA had purchased
05:51 origin origin was creating Ultima Online
05:52 so by 1994 were playing the the
05:56 essentially like the Delta versions of
05:58 the game and we're like okay we don't
06:01 need to do this we just need to make
06:02 sure this game is great and so for four
06:05 years play tested the hell out of that
06:06 thing it releases in 98 meanwhile I'm
06:09 working on the physics of and ready
06:13 racing as a tester giving my feedback as
06:16 when I first came to California race
06:18 cars little carts you know with a k' and
06:22 [Applause]
06:24 eventually you know worked on knockout
06:28 Kings I did the music for some of the
06:30 music for knockout Kings but when you're
06:32 at EA you do everything you know there's
06:34 the technical roles you can have would
06:37 be I guess tech support which and ever
06:38 worked in QA which I started in and then
06:41 you have essentially Associate Producer
06:43 three to one then you have producer
06:46 three is trying to think I guess three
06:50 was the highest you know sometimes it's
06:52 the DEF CON they reversed the numbers
06:55 but meanwhile we're playing every video
06:58 game out there we're playing all the
07:00 Westwood games which we eventually
07:01 acquired Westwood after we realized we
07:03 couldn't beat them
07:05 funny so lots of command & Conquer Red
07:07 Alert the original versions of the game
07:09 tons of Duke Nukem tons of doom so I've
07:12 been around and we would also do a lot
07:14 of coin op games so we go out and play a
07:16 lot of coin op games at the Gulf and
07:18 stuff and pizza parlors and all that
07:19 stuff I even tried to get into coin op
07:23 at one point when Virtua Fighter came
07:24 out and the coin op we made a whole
07:27 division of coin up and tried to do it
07:28 and bailed out of it by 1999 I had
07:33 developed so much internet talent that I
07:37 took over the internet group of coders
07:40 and then ended up taking over the whole
07:41 department over six months or so and
07:45 really exited studio and most of my
07:48 friends who were in studio which is
07:49 where we what we call making game area
07:51 they migrated out and went to work for
07:54 Microsoft created their home video game
07:55 companies and so then by 2004 what I
08:00 ended up doing was starting to make
08:02 games online in flash which flash a
08:05 tremendous amount of bugs and si had to
08:07 be an extremely good coder eventually
08:10 because of my art background an artist
08:12 that had failed us I ended up having to
08:14 cover for art as well as the code then I
08:16 kind of got a chance to get out of the
08:18 code and I was always in the the design
08:22 part of it so creating story behind
08:25 whatever the hell was going on you know
08:27 I gave solitaire story okay which I'll
08:29 explain a little bit I have taught at
08:33 well I've lectured at you know Berkeley
08:37 University universe UC Irvine Chapman
08:42 University gnomon School of Art and
08:45 video and was at film and television
08:48 they have a gaming's division as well so
08:51 I've been around their industry for a
08:53 very very long time
08:54 I you know I'm just an inquisitive
08:57 person so for me you know someone would
09:00 go off and create a pipeline diagram
09:02 that was 40 feet long which is how we
09:04 make games at EA I'd studied the crap
09:08 out of it even though I didn't have to
09:09 at all times the DA if you know the
09:12 producers which I knew quite a few of
09:13 them you get invited into the design
09:16 meetings and so you sit there and help
09:17 this
09:18 James Bond game or some ritual Minh
09:21 Hillerman masterpiece of his own
09:24 creation so you get to participate you
09:27 know and not all your ideas are taken
09:30 but because I was always an engineer and
09:32 an artist and a designer and a writer
09:35 when I suggested an idea I saw the code
09:38 I saw the art I saw all the bits and
09:40 pieces that would need to be realized to
09:42 make the feature come true a study game
09:46 engines like it's crazy I mean you know
09:49 the game editors and and how difficult
09:51 it was to make a game and it's always
09:53 been fairly difficult up until recently
09:56 so this episode is not about my
09:59 background but I wanted to give you that
10:00 very quickly so that you kind of
10:02 understand the value of perhaps perhaps
10:06 the value of my opinion about what I'm
10:08 about to say because I think the gaming
10:10 industry is clearly financially provably
10:14 in really bad shape
10:17 and I don't think it's necessarily the
10:20 fault of any game company we have game
10:24 companies that have made mistakes with
10:26 their franchises unfortunately that's a
10:29 pretty organic process and it's
10:30 something that usually occurs and that's
10:33 why when you make a game company and the
10:36 game company is successful when you
10:39 realize you have a successful team you
10:43 have to spend as much money as possible
10:45 to keep that team happy and to make sure
10:47 they never leave to make sure they're
10:49 inspired find out what inspires them
10:52 it's not gonna be something you give
10:53 them necessarily most the time it's
10:55 something they do in their personal life
10:56 you have to fuel it if you had to give
10:59 them gobs of money that you would
11:01 normally give in any other business
11:03 that's what you have to do and I'll give
11:05 you a case in point if any of you have
11:08 seen the latest Marvel movies right I'm
11:11 just gonna mention Marvel what is it if
11:14 any wars in game we'll talk about the
11:17 movie no but realize how many people are
11:20 cast in that film it is everybody who's
11:23 ever been in that film when if Paltrow
11:25 came back to be in that film there are
11:27 people if you watch the credits at the
11:29 end who aren't even in the movie like
11:30 Natalie
11:31 Portman you get a full-face credit
11:33 they're paying millions and millions and
11:38 tens of millions of dollars to keep that
11:41 franchise in place to make sure that
11:44 Robert Downey jr. doesn't run off and
11:45 create some other movie and they'll try
11:47 to contractually force him to stay in
11:49 that and every time he gives up some
11:51 other opportunities gonna say that'll
11:53 cost you ten million the movies budget
11:56 supposedly around 350 million it made
11:58 over or 1.5 billion at this point it'll
12:01 surely at 2 billion at some point you
12:04 know I would assume that the casting
12:06 budget for that film is probably 150 to
12:10 200 million dollars I could be foolishly
12:12 thinking that but I think the special
12:13 effects are damn near a hundred million
12:16 dollars so you know we're talking a cast
12:19 and crew the hold the director everyone
12:21 involved right but those those actors
12:24 that cost a tremendous amount of money
12:26 but guess what they show up for work
12:27 they blast out a great film as long as
12:29 the scripts fantastic which that script
12:31 was very solid you got a great film on
12:34 your hands and you have something that's
12:35 worth 10 times as much as you spent you
12:39 know almost eight seven eight times more
12:40 than you spent who knows right it's not
12:43 over yet so let me give you some very
12:49 quick observations about what I think is
12:51 going on now and then let's reverse back
12:53 to the the genesis of how these kind of
12:56 things happen because I watched a bunch
12:57 of it happen in Electronic Arts when I
12:59 work for Electronic Arts they were the
13:01 number one publisher of video games in
13:03 the world we were the first people to
13:05 hit a billion dollars in one year of
13:08 gross sales we were the first to hit
13:09 three billion and then Activision
13:13 through financing World of Warcraft
13:16 you know Blizzard basically run out of
13:19 money and so we need more money I think
13:20 it was about a hundred and twenty three
13:21 million dollars to finish World of
13:24 Warcraft they had a beautiful franchise
13:26 called Warcraft it was ready to go they
13:28 had just an inspired team that just I
13:32 mean they not only hit it out of like
13:34 Fenway Park but the ball is still
13:36 traveling in the universe you know for
13:38 the first version of this game I mean it
13:40 it will probably never be outdone until
13:43 we have more
13:44 technology that we can blow people away
13:46 with you know but at inside you know
13:50 Electronic Arts what we had was a great
13:52 indie team of developers and designers a
13:57 lot of times you know the code is done
13:59 off-site by some really hot company that
14:02 is you know some some major experts that
14:05 know how to make things wasn't always
14:08 that way
14:09 but what they did was a small clicky
14:13 group of folks that had a financial line
14:15 item like a bucket in the budget they
14:19 get this much money and if they make
14:20 this much money over some expected
14:23 amount of revenue they start getting
14:25 profit sharing and so it was hugely
14:28 inspiring to the team to not only do
14:30 what they love to do for our living have
14:33 the corporate heads out of their face no
14:35 marketing team telling them how to
14:37 program a game which happens it's just
14:40 insane right right before Andretti
14:42 racing was created by EA which I think
14:45 it was 96 they you know it's the first
14:47 3d racing game on a console tremendous
14:51 right ps1 right marketing came to the
14:56 high-score group run by Michael Pole and
14:59 they said we've got the engine you're
15:01 gonna use to make this game and we
15:03 looked at it and it was pole position
15:04 from 1985 Bar None it was like a car
15:09 with a pin stuck through it and all you
15:11 could see was the front end kind of
15:12 turning and then the track would kind of
15:13 do this just like pole position in the
15:15 video game and of course there was like
15:18 what are you doing talking to us you're
15:20 marketing go figure out how to make an
15:21 ad go make some shots keys you know so
15:25 that idea got thrown out one of the best
15:27 video games of the time was created you
15:32 know fully accurate maps of real courses
15:34 we had advertising we thought this was a
15:37 good idea advertising in the game
15:38 exactly like it's in the course it was
15:42 very realistic it was amazing a lot of
15:45 hardships to I mean first 3d game in the
15:48 world
15:48 we were playing betas where the the
15:50 polygons of the track were ripping apart
15:52 so you could see underneath you know
15:54 parts of the game the physics came in
15:57 perfectly real
15:58 and that doesn't work with hand
16:01 controllers or keyboards because it's
16:03 it's way too much data from a hand
16:05 controller and so you'd wreck your car
16:06 in two seconds because unlike a Formula
16:09 One steering wheel which turns you know
16:11 just a little bit you could do a 360 on
16:13 the steering wheel no problem and that's
16:15 not what happens in the real world so
16:18 we're figuring all that stuff out but
16:22 that team was just blowing the doors off
16:25 of titles one after in another afternoon
16:28 there's a bunch of a bunch of games that
16:32 did extremely well they don't get any
16:34 fanfare at all
16:36 and of course EA bought a bunch of
16:39 studios and to get a bad rep because
16:41 they buy a studio just before they're
16:43 about to crash their team had been
16:44 obliterated something went wrong at that
16:47 company but their last title was great
16:49 ea buys them they create they released
16:52 the piece of crap that they know they've
16:53 got in the in the shoot and EA got
16:56 blamed for it which is what yeh got a
16:57 big bad reputation he has done some
16:59 other things experimenting with their
17:02 business models and pissed a lot of
17:03 people off in this last decade and it
17:05 doesn't have anything to do with what I
17:07 know about them right now Gaming is
17:09 hurting badly Activision Blizzard
17:14 they're in a really bad situation
17:16 super bad situation World of Warcraft is
17:19 dead the only one playing that game are
17:22 folks that just either recently
17:24 discovered and having fun with all the
17:26 previous expansion packs that they got
17:28 right are there simply diehard fans that
17:32 are probably you know tears running down
17:34 their face constantly as they wish the
17:37 game was good they've lost their mojo
17:39 the people that made those expansions
17:41 amazing and that that knew when an
17:44 expansion was finished and knew how to
17:47 design one on paper before they ever
17:49 started any production those people
17:51 don't exist anymore at that company or
17:53 if they do they're not being listened to
17:55 and that's the same problem you have
17:57 right I can tell you right now
17:59 I had my when I had my 40th birthday I
18:04 had a very good friend of Mines house a
18:07 bunch of Blizzard guys showed up because
18:10 they like my friend he's famous for some
18:12 others
18:12 and I got to meet a bunch of them and
18:14 then started hanging out with them
18:15 started becoming friends with them and
18:17 started learning about the internals of
18:20 Blizzard and at that time Blizzard was
18:23 still knocking it out of the park
18:25 great expansions and then that that
18:27 mystery mystery project got lit up
18:29 everybody went over to the mystery
18:31 project all of a sudden you know things
18:34 started dying off internally the
18:36 expansion started to have a few problems
18:39 and then eventually the big project gets
18:42 canceled all those people leave EA and
18:44 early start eat lead blizzard and now
18:46 blizzards just hollow of its original
18:49 DNA now of course there's some folks
18:52 that are still there but you'll also
18:54 find out a lot of folks lie about what
18:56 they do on video games I definitely met
18:58 one of their longest employees I'm at
19:01 the CEO four or five times at various
19:03 events and Huntington Beach and I
19:06 usually Oktoberfests really funny the
19:07 guy that just left super nice guy super
19:10 nice guy but you know he doesn't get in
19:13 everybody's way but there's some people
19:15 that will run around from Blizzard no
19:17 black I do this I do that and then you
19:19 find out internally they do [ __ ] in fact
19:21 they actually take other artists artwork
19:24 and put their name on it and release it
19:25 as their own stuff I mean got some of
19:28 those people in there too it's bad news
19:30 man
19:30 it's exactly how you kill your company
19:32 and usually what happens is once they
19:36 start getting called out they start
19:37 doubling down no we're not that way when
19:39 they really are and so they get this
19:40 this implosion of complete denial about
19:43 how the company works and then everybody
19:46 just wants to get a paycheck and go home
19:48 until the whole place closes down but
19:51 Starcraft what are you gonna do it's
19:53 locked into so many eSports at this
19:55 point to add one little troop or one
19:58 little modification you have you know
20:00 million people crying like ball babies
20:02 because it messes up the balance of the
20:03 game it probably does can't invent a
20:05 brand new race very easily because it's
20:07 so locked into eSports you can't just
20:09 play a game and have fun with it it's
20:12 got a payoff in this eSports thing so
20:16 eSports is one of the clamps on game
20:19 design obviously they have the same
20:23 thing inside of well the worker
20:25 or you can have these for cocktail
20:28 they're called that you know the the
20:29 sparring matches where you just
20:31 basically team against team for me that
20:32 shit's so damn boring
20:34 I want story I want to crawl out of the
20:36 world I'm in I don't want some
20:38 twelve-year-old kid living off to me
20:39 online you know give me a break
20:41 go create a separate game with those
20:43 assets get that code completely out of
20:45 my game so that I'll have to bump into
20:47 this whole thing right that's my
20:49 personal opinion
20:50 Diablo Diablo 3 fantastic game what's
20:55 blizzards problem just release an
20:57 expansion pack that gives us more
20:59 artwork new locations new storyline you
21:02 don't need to change anything you could
21:04 reuse some of the characters I don't
21:05 care just put me in a different place
21:06 advance the storyline criticize
21:08 storyline you know rogue one off off on
21:11 the side I'll give you money I'll play
21:14 it and I'm gonna go into the dungeon you
21:16 know I got some more some more chats
21:17 keys you get more dungeon art basically
21:19 right when it's all over no they sit
21:23 there pretending like that's impossible
21:24 wondering why the revenue is going down
21:26 now they're trying to put Diablo on a
21:27 telephone well they're doing it right
21:31 bad idea is bad ideas because someone
21:33 walks in a room and goes oh you know
21:34 Mobile's huge for a handful of people
21:38 when you the Blizzard move Blizzard did
21:42 the mistake that Apple did Steve Jobs
21:46 always said I make things that I love
21:47 and that my employees love and then you
21:49 end up loving it too and it's nothing
21:51 you would expect and it's absolutely
21:52 nothing a marketing department can
21:54 conceive of because marketing people are
21:55 not engineers or not inventors they
21:58 don't even know what's possible so don't
22:00 listen to them don't do focus groups to
22:02 figure out what you make next
22:03 lest you fail and bankrupt your company
22:06 what Blizzard has done too much of that
22:09 that's why you got mobile Diablo it's ok
22:14 if you do that but don't let go of the
22:15 main major product now they're talking
22:18 about canceling hearthstone and a bunch
22:20 of other stuff and you may never do
22:21 those those cancellations but they're
22:23 looking at cancelling two or three of
22:25 their other games because they're not
22:27 making money and it cost a lot of money
22:28 to make these things and keep them alive
22:29 and the battlenet fees and all that
22:31 stuff but that's just Blizzard breaks my
22:36 heart great company I've seen some of my
22:38 closest friends
22:39 used to work there you know recently
22:41 have to leave and it just blows my mind
22:44 because they have the DNA that that
22:46 company needs you know but the number
22:50 one thing that's killing gaming right
22:51 now this is too many platforms think
22:56 about it
22:57 everyone's got mobile and of course
22:59 that's the big that's the big thing now
23:01 mobile mobile Mobile well there's only
23:02 so much you can have in terms of an
23:04 experience on a mobile device even if
23:06 you get a big powerful tablet come on
23:08 it's a little tiny what 12 inch screen
23:10 if you've spent a ton of money you know
23:13 $1500 you can get yourself a beefed-up
23:15 ain't no iPad it still sucks compared to
23:18 a 60-inch television some of you folks
23:20 have 80 inch televisions they're not
23:22 that expensive anymore
23:23 talk about a fully immersive experience
23:26 think about an 80 inch television split
23:27 in half so you could play co-op you
23:30 still have 40 inches of piece you know
23:32 that Corey and Pythagoras is theorem and
23:34 all that but you have a giant piece of
23:35 real estate to play with well there's
23:38 still Ark you know the ps4 Xbox 360
23:43 you got your Nintendo but these
23:45 platforms initially just so that you
23:47 guys know they were designed to sit on
23:50 your entertainment center for 10 years
23:54 before they were versioned that was the
23:55 goal and then of course pcs the personal
23:59 computers at home are light-years beyond
24:03 those consoles by the time that that
24:05 even the 7-year mark is showing up pehle
24:07 even probably before the five-year mark
24:08 shows up so now people look at their
24:11 computers and they look at these
24:14 consoles and they're like this is a
24:18 horrible experience or it's not as good
24:20 now today the consoles are pretty badass
24:23 but still there's a limitations to these
24:27 things people can feel it now there's
24:30 too many consoles you gotta make this
24:32 religious choice well you know if the
24:35 Sony's got that exclusive game and
24:37 that's the Xbox 360 as a an exclusive
24:40 game and they're all like you know 600
24:42 bucks when they first come out am I
24:44 gonna wait two three four or five years
24:47 for the thing to get to 399 or $2.99 now
24:50 you know if you're a gamer you want it
24:51 right away you don't want some
24:52 half-assed thing and you want to spend
24:54 $300 on a console and then about four or
24:57 five thousand bucks on the games as you
24:59 get them and you're only like you know
25:01 six games in and here comes the new
25:03 console and you start to feel like how
25:06 am i can I just throw away all that
25:07 money mobile mobile Mobile had a huge
25:14 problem in when mobile games sucked it
25:17 had a huge problem before it got really
25:20 cool with smartphones and now we're back
25:22 to the shitty problem and it would go
25:24 something like this the carrier's used
25:27 to be were when you got a phone you had
25:29 a sprint phone or you know AT&T phone or
25:33 whatever
25:34 Verizon phone t-mobile and you had to go
25:37 to their store to buy a game and you
25:42 would have to pay them special amounts
25:44 of money to promo your game in the top
25:47 ten and then the odds that anyone would
25:50 see your game if you weren't in the top
25:51 ten or next to zero if you were 11 you
25:55 went down you know orders of magnitude
25:58 from ever being seen well here comes the
26:03 iPhone it's a little bit better it's one
26:05 vendor it's Apple they want to promote
26:09 games as much as possible and so their
26:11 store was redesigned to get rid of this
26:12 top 10 thing I mean they they all have
26:14 their top but you can scroll for miles
26:16 now and see a bunch of different games
26:18 you wouldn't see they have different
26:20 ways of filtering it these games have
26:21 made a lot of money these games are
26:23 they'll have a lot of downloads but it's
26:25 free you can drill down into categories
26:28 now a lot better than they used to be
26:31 but now it's back to that pretty much
26:35 there's about three ways to filter
26:37 things nobody usually hits the filter
26:39 and tries to go any deeper they do a lot
26:42 of cross promotion which is really cool
26:44 I found a lot of great games nowadays by
26:46 going to the one I like and then
26:48 specifically revisiting the game I've
26:51 already exhausted in the store just to
26:53 see what the recommendations are based
26:54 on other people who like this game also
26:58 like this game is a very common
27:00 algorithm that's out there today but
27:03 then there's the phone
27:05 okay there's there's a lot of
27:07 experiences on the phone that I
27:08 appreciate when I'm stuck on an airport
27:10 on a plane wanna just omit you know I'm
27:13 at night and I just want I'm in bed I
27:14 just want to unwind my mind sure that's
27:17 cool but I desperately miss something
27:22 big something like a deus ex coming out
27:25 with some badass you know sequel and
27:28 they're there are great franchises out
27:30 there and I'm I'm not saying any of the
27:32 great franchises that you love or bad
27:34 they're great and there's those are the
27:36 franchises that are literally the tent
27:38 poles holding up the circus at this
27:40 point but there used to be a lot more
27:43 choices folks one of the saddest things
27:46 that's happened pretty much to the
27:49 entire world and it's something that I
27:52 hope it gets reprise in a way and that
27:59 is the brick-and-mortar stores have been
28:00 all but destroyed
28:02 anybody who's still brick-and-mortar has
28:04 to be a big target a Walmart some big
28:07 giant thing but we all know that game
28:11 stops are all going being shut down
28:13 downsizing because everybody wants to
28:16 get it online you can watch the trailer
28:19 to figure if you like the gameplay and
28:22 talk to some of your friends and then
28:24 boom you just order it straight to your
28:26 house okay you know I think I might have
28:30 mentioned episode that hasn't aired yet
28:32 that our local electronic store is Fry's
28:36 which is now across the United States
28:38 looks like they're going out of business
28:41 Fry's you know their their problem is
28:45 they didn't focus on what they were good
28:47 at they expanded into a bunch of
28:50 different territories our local Fry's
28:53 literally started selling you know
28:56 vacuum cleaners and washers and dryers
28:58 and you know and I guess that's okay
29:01 they were always known for selling
29:02 everything when they opened up in the
29:04 Bay Area
29:05 I eat light live there right when they
29:07 opened up and remember going to the one
29:09 in Mountain View which i think is one of
29:10 their very first stores they ever opened
29:12 and you know it was like tampons next to
29:15 videogames right at the register it was
29:17 really funny and
29:18 was like everybody loved it because it
29:19 was also small so they didn't have a lot
29:22 of overhead with the rents they didn't
29:24 carry everything on planet Earth and
29:25 they tended they tend tended to at the
29:29 time to hire SuperDuper expert nerd kids
29:32 you know everything about everything now
29:36 they still have some great staff members
29:38 that man you'd go in a router section
29:40 and these dudes you tell them what
29:42 you're looking for and what you need
29:43 they've got all the questions for it's
29:44 fantastic you know other times I've
29:47 walked into the store once went over to
29:49 the camera section hint stood there this
29:53 was in the barrier and I'm trying to get
29:56 a camera real fast I had two guys
29:57 talking to each other right in front of
29:59 me badges on whole thing and so I'm
30:01 sitting there I'm being polite trying to
30:03 let them get their thing down but down
30:05 listening to them and they're talking
30:06 about nothing you know it's I go hey can
30:09 you guys help me with the camera section
30:12 real fast
30:13 they literally looked at me didn't
30:16 acknowledge I existed other than to look
30:18 at me didn't say anything went back and
30:21 start looking each other
30:23 unbelievable right now those little
30:25 things happen everywhere you go am I
30:26 saying that's indicative all the stores
30:27 but I remember that experience so the
30:31 one thing the reason why I mentioned
30:33 brick-and-mortar real quickly is because
30:35 there's an experience that used to exist
30:37 that was phenomenal and I will tell you
30:40 it's a two factor system that has killed
30:43 this and if we ever brought it back it
30:46 would be phenomenal and it's actually
30:48 killed a particular species of video
30:50 game that we no longer make and if you
30:52 know of anything that's being made
30:53 that's like this please say it in the
30:55 comments down below but we used to buy
30:58 games in boxes cardboard boxes and then
31:03 of course the video game companies learn
31:05 the compressor on a disc put in a little
31:07 plastic you know CD DVD blu-ray
31:10 container you get this little teeny tiny
31:12 manual in there which is so tiny it's
31:14 [ __ ] you throw the thing away or
31:16 whatever you keep it for the collection
31:18 or whatever right but when you've got a
31:20 box here's what was cool about this and
31:23 some of you will remember experiences
31:25 that are just fascinating but you get
31:28 this box and you know like LucasArts
31:32 released loom that released the Indiana
31:34 Jones series the Carmen Sandiego series
31:37 the Sierra online games with the was at
31:42 Leisure Suit Larry Space Quest King's
31:46 Quest all those games you'd open this
31:49 box and you'd start pulling out you know
31:52 like Indiana Jones books like the one he
31:55 had in the first Noah then the third one
31:57 where he he was reading through it on
31:58 how to find the Holy Grail right you
32:00 would get books like that in the box it
32:02 was a very atmospheric out of box
32:04 experience where just the materials that
32:07 you brought out of the box would set the
32:10 scene for you
32:11 some of them had posters that you put on
32:13 your wall that had information on it and
32:15 you know fallout Bethesda has some
32:18 special edition once and you know
32:20 Blizzard has like the big collector's
32:23 edition box so I've got them signed by
32:25 all the creators those are okay but then
32:29 you know a big hardback book is not what
32:31 we're talking about an extra CD of the
32:33 sounds of this of the soundtrack it's
32:35 not what I'm talking about a poster that
32:38 doesn't do anything it's not what I'm
32:39 talking about but when you got fallout
32:42 you got a little pit boy you could put
32:44 on your arm I mean you know do it thing
32:46 broke instantaneously Bethesda is the
32:49 worst back worst reputation for a
32:52 releasing [ __ ] it's crazy he had a
32:54 duffel bag on one of them and everybody
32:56 said the thing they got was plastic and
32:58 junk right yeah charging eighty dollars
33:00 for a box a piece of cardboard doesn't
33:04 give you any leeway to create quality
33:05 products does it Bethesda really funny
33:07 love you guys but damn come on now but
33:11 this experience disappeared in the 90s
33:13 when everything started going into these
33:15 CD cases super sad Ben it kills the
33:20 experience we have a definition of the
33:22 experience and the definition is do what
33:25 you can with the assets in the box to
33:27 set the scene to give someone you know
33:29 like imagine like back in the day before
33:31 we had cell phones at least it did
33:34 anything other than make a phone call
33:35 you can take that little book to bed at
33:37 night and have your little lamp pointing
33:39 and you're reading about how your troops
33:40 work and how everything works it's all
33:42 in the book not today there's so
33:46 frickin lazy they're like what if we
33:47 changed the paragraph what if we update
33:49 the video game and tune that character
33:50 this that and the other thing okay well
33:53 don't put don't put stats in there in
33:55 the frickin manual just tell me this
33:57 tower does this this guy does that this
33:59 sword does this on average okay now with
34:02 the world of warcraft there's
34:04 limitations because there's what 50,000
34:07 items you can pick up in that game not
34:10 talking about that but still think about
34:13 it
34:14 sit down the Lord people at Blizzard and
34:17 say we're gonna we're gonna rebirth this
34:19 whole thing we're gonna have a poster
34:21 we're gonna have a little book we're
34:23 gonna actually buy some little the cap
34:25 some little items made you know like
34:27 maybe a monocle or some little coin
34:29 that's special to something whatever
34:31 this is something to set the scene so
34:35 that whole experience dried up and the
34:37 only experience you ever get now is this
34:39 dry ass experience through the screen
34:42 but I'm still in my living room still in
34:45 my bed not that interesting what you
34:48 wanted to do was have some assets in the
34:50 outside world that would give you the
34:52 notion of how intense this game was
34:54 going to be and how much you're going to
34:55 be exploring the game so it used to be
34:59 when I was leaving the big console game
35:04 PC game division to go into Internet and
35:07 then bounce out to my own company I
35:09 created everyone was trying to make
35:13 video games more movie-like because they
35:15 realized this video power is here they
35:19 knew that we were going to be migrating
35:20 to internal hard drives the medium was
35:22 going to eventually start getting
35:23 downloaded so really the economy of a
35:26 video game meaning your disk space your
35:30 memory inside the unit your sound power
35:33 your 3d animation power all that stuff
35:37 was starting to peel off there weren't
35:38 any limitations you know we still have
35:41 limitations on memory inside these units
35:44 which is in my opinion unforgivable I
35:46 mean we should be able to play we should
35:49 be able to have games like World of
35:51 Warcraft on a console this [ __ ] of
35:54 not being able to have a keyboard
35:55 connected to it is stupid you had a
35:57 bunch of USB ports and all these units
35:59 but
35:59 you plug a keyboard in nothing happens I
36:01 mean really you can get a keyboard
36:03 driver for a freaking console no some of
36:06 you may know that's different now I
36:07 don't know I don't own any consoles
36:09 anymore I have a ps3 that's super sexy
36:13 and collecting dusts it's when it's the
36:15 first version of it which was all round
36:16 and super polished out and glossy but
36:19 they were trying to make a bunch of
36:23 story and they were studying
36:25 cinematography ei ended up hiring some
36:28 professional cinematographers and
36:30 directors to teach them how to do this
36:33 you know one of the last projects I was
36:36 involved in just as like a little sup
36:38 mean again you're just a dude you're
36:40 just a dude that knows some stuff and
36:41 you pitch in some ideas but someone
36:43 found out my love for film and it was
36:46 the the golf series we had a DA and they
36:48 were like well how would you move the
36:49 camera to make this more cinematic
36:52 because we know how it's filmed on
36:54 television we got all that in the game
36:56 is there something else that we can do
36:58 so we're all pitching and her ideas it
37:02 used to be that we would worry about
37:05 story not being that deep in a video
37:08 game as these games started to blow up
37:11 you know it starts to cost a lot of
37:12 money if you're like oh we're gonna have
37:13 the city and we're gonna have this place
37:14 you're gonna be able to go in all these
37:15 doors and stuff when everything was done
37:18 by hand that that equaled a tremendous
37:21 amount of money then coders got smart
37:25 you know like ah we're gonna
37:26 procedurally generate a bunch of this
37:28 stuff just like Diablo dungeons they're
37:29 all procedurally generated you never see
37:31 the same dungeon twice right
37:33 brilliant brought down the costs and
37:36 then they could randomly overlay on top
37:37 of a particular room a storyline they
37:41 just have to make sure the items that
37:42 the story is going to require to
37:44 complete this particular quest or in
37:46 that location okay that's interesting
37:51 now what games like World of Warcraft
37:53 you definitely have to have places that
37:55 exist because quests don't change and
37:57 you're gonna be able to tell your buddy
37:58 yeah go up there you know you're on the
38:00 headset you know you go upstairs you see
38:01 that thing okay that's right there under
38:02 the book okay oh yeah you totally got it
38:04 great right so what we don't have in
38:08 terms of limitation we drop any
38:11 limitation with creativity you know
38:13 the need to write amazing visual effects
38:17 on this title amazing storylines you can
38:20 always make things better but come on
38:22 they've got to get the game done and out
38:23 the door at some point I think fallout 3
38:26 was fantastic safe the engine that they
38:28 decided to to use could not handle
38:30 expansions on any platform without
38:32 crashing PC was the less crash e1
38:36 fallout 4 i think was utterly ten a ten
38:42 out of ten I think fallout 4 is
38:44 tremendous I've been playing that game
38:45 for three years
38:46 I haven't played it for several months
38:48 but I still find rooms I still find
38:51 brand new places it's crazy I get that
38:53 discovery thing across the top now what
38:56 I do think is a design flaw with games
38:59 like that fallout 4 has three different
39:01 endings you are responsible for saving
39:05 the game before you make the ultimate
39:06 decision about which of the three
39:08 endings you're going to go to the game
39:10 should rewind itself back to that
39:13 decision point and let you automatically
39:16 through the design of the engine go for
39:17 option two option three and relive the
39:20 world past that point in my opinion but
39:25 that's not what's wrong with the gaming
39:26 industry the other gigantic problem with
39:30 the gaming industry and this is gonna
39:32 sound anti-free market ok I don't think
39:36 any I don't let me just explain it a
39:39 bunch of [ __ ] games are made 24/7 a
39:42 bunch of shitty games games with amazing
39:46 art packages amazing sound packages I
39:48 mean they look phenomenal a bunch of
39:51 merchants copycat games out of China and
39:53 Russia did just take a game and they
39:56 copied themselves that's just
39:58 necessarily you but they copy themselves
40:00 like 25 times the other huge thing
40:05 that's going on is that they give you
40:06 false trailers of gameplay how many
40:10 times have you seen these big cinematic
40:12 amazing things and you download it even
40:15 see it on TV so I'm gonna promote the
40:17 game front of one of these channels on
40:19 YouTube and they'll literally show you a
40:21 video of gameplay that does not exist in
40:24 the game
40:26 a bunch of these manager City games
40:30 where they say oh there's a bunch of
40:31 zombie sieges on you and you have to do
40:33 all the sudden they make it look like
40:34 it's like will the war not broke off
40:36 like I could be in a conquered type game
40:38 and you get in there and you can't put
40:40 the tower wherever you want it's got
40:42 these little sockets that you have to
40:44 put them in you know it's stupid so
40:46 here's here's what I think could help
40:49 the game industry tremendously somebody
40:53 has to come up with a brand and you're
40:56 essentially like a consumer protection
40:58 group for gamers and you get in there
41:01 and you look at the game and you give it
41:04 a classification it is one of these type
41:06 of games pick out the genre it is like
41:08 these other games now is it original or
41:11 is it a copy if it's a copy you need to
41:14 put it in the copy column as well
41:15 it's another ripoff of this game it's
41:18 exactly that game but they've done this
41:20 in this in this maybe it's better and
41:22 certainly maybe it's crappy or in a
41:24 certain way yes there are puzzle game
41:28 categories there's hidden objects you
41:30 know for casual gaming there there are a
41:32 lot of great keywords in there but the
41:36 problem is is that they're setting the
41:37 expectation especially with a bunch of
41:41 these false reviews - the other big rub
41:43 is that these these companies in China
41:46 I've seen videos you've probably seen
41:47 videos of this where they have literally
41:49 tens of thousands of cellphones on what
41:53 looks like a magazine rack and they're
41:56 all plugged in and they are simply just
41:58 waking up going into a you know review
42:01 forum logging in and putting in some so
42:05 just cut and paste article or you know
42:07 review on something making a game look
42:11 like it's been five starred by 20,000
42:14 people you get into it and you play for
42:16 two seconds you're like oh my god
42:17 and a second you go back into the
42:19 reviews and hit the one-star index on
42:23 the reviews you start finding out that
42:24 nobody likes this game and it has a
42:26 bunch of problems and does it or not but
42:29 you might have paid for before that
42:30 that's over it used to be and I think
42:34 this is still the case with the with the
42:35 consoles you can't just put a game on
42:38 the Sony Playstation you can't just
42:40 put a game on the Xbox you can't they
42:44 have to look at your game and approve of
42:46 it it's got to be up to this the power
42:48 of this console because they're gonna
42:50 take the reputation hit if it's a piece
42:52 of junk that's brilliant
42:55 I would say that you need to turn that
42:57 standard up as high as you can get it
42:59 and make sure people understand maybe
43:01 there's an indie game channel where a
43:03 lot of lesser products can be reviewed I
43:06 mean you know why not make it a three
43:08 tier system at minimum super-high level
43:11 games that the company that makes the
43:12 console says this is what we're willing
43:14 to sponsor an indie area which is the
43:17 higher in indie area and then maybe the
43:21 complete sandbox area where you can just
43:23 play around with [ __ ] constantly right
43:26 it's free that way you don't have to
43:29 worry about refunding and have all had a
43:31 nightmare now one of the coolest things
43:33 that's happened but it's still
43:35 struggling is steam steam is a cool
43:39 platform you get on there and you have a
43:42 lot of the classic games for nothing I
43:44 mean like pennies on the dollar I went
43:46 up the other day and they were blowing
43:48 out games that I have absolutely drooled
43:50 over they're not as fun to play you know
43:53 later on in life but get it for three
43:56 bucks I was looking at the Space Quest
43:59 series well like they made way more than
44:01 I ever thought if they're up to six or
44:03 seven Space Quest or something like that
44:04 before they turned off the company see
44:06 her online I think it could buy the
44:09 whole thing for four bucks you know I
44:12 tried to play it one day but 10 15 years
44:15 ago and it was so slow I couldn't
44:17 couldn't stomach it but there's a lot of
44:20 classic games if they just resurrect it
44:22 and get it executable I'd pay money for
44:24 it you know the only thing that steam
44:26 runs into is that a lot of companies
44:28 won't sell their games through Steam
44:30 because they don't want to give steam
44:31 any money so you know they can't even do
44:36 like what's really sad is like a World
44:38 of Warcraft installer okay so you're not
44:41 gonna give you know blizzards not gonna
44:43 give you the normal commission that you
44:45 would you know get off a normal video
44:47 game but just do some just do some
44:49 special business deal where you say look
44:51 do you ever buy advertising Blizzard
44:53 yeah
44:54 how much do you pay of someone clicks
44:55 the ad and actually installs the video
44:57 game and starts a subscription with you
44:59 oh we get my five bucks all right well
45:02 why don't you give us five bucks if
45:03 we're able to hook that little link up
45:06 whatever you pay for advertising paid
45:08 for us we're gonna use it as an anchor
45:11 to get people to come to us for this
45:14 other thing what was it
45:16 fallout 76 brief I think refused I don't
45:20 know if it's there yet but they refuse
45:22 to go through steam they're like where
45:25 the where the bomb and then 76 tanks
45:27 hardcore okay I don't think there's a
45:32 problem with the amount of video game
45:34 companies I think that's always fun
45:38 always healthy I think that when the
45:42 video games were coming out you know the
45:44 very first video games we really had
45:45 were the stand-up coin-op games right
45:47 and then it was pushed the barrier
45:50 pushed the barrier push the barrier and
45:52 then you got the the Nintendo and then
45:56 you know we always have that target 2600
45:58 which was sort of kind of lame ripoffs
46:00 of the coin-op games but still you got
46:03 to do it in your house for free you get
46:04 to play as much as you want you had the
46:06 Intellivision ColecoVision Nintendo
46:09 Super Nintendo and so that was fun I
46:12 mean those Nintendo probably hit it out
46:15 of the park more than any other home
46:16 console in world history because people
46:20 still play zelda my smoke lounge has the
46:23 snez you know reboot box we must have
46:27 played Zelda I don't know 50 times
46:30 finish the game just on a Saturday
46:33 afternoon because we're bored just
46:34 finish the game this is this year so the
46:37 other thing if we go off back the story
46:40 and the game design itself we have great
46:44 game engines now there's no problem with
46:46 sickness there's no problem with being
46:48 able to create a game properly so you
46:50 have you don't have to fight the engine
46:52 anymore like you used to back in the 90s
46:53 when we're trying to push everything
46:54 into 3d we have enough memory and disk
46:57 space and computer processing speed and
47:00 i/o speed on the machines that we can do
47:02 infinite scrolling worlds hey that's
47:05 cool that means there's a
47:07 pretty much what you can imagine can be
47:09 made inside the game that's great but
47:13 now let's look at Nintendo for a split
47:16 second when you were in the coin op
47:19 world before Nintendo really got into
47:21 the home console thing the algorithms
47:24 were so tight for what was a video game
47:27 what was a game in general asteroids and
47:30 and was gorf Ike was sort one of the
47:34 games but you had pac-man miss pac-man
47:37 you know you star Castle I mean just a
47:40 billion games right but they were all
47:43 very limited in what they did so what
47:47 that allowed the game designers to do is
47:49 to figure out what's fun about this it's
47:52 very repetitive so whatever we're
47:54 repeating has got to be very addictive
47:56 to the mind it's got to be a dopamine
47:57 drop at a certain interval right you
48:01 can't stay in the like in pac-man you
48:05 don't have the ability to eat the ghost
48:07 the entire time they put those bigger
48:09 pellets in all four corners so it's
48:11 difficult to get to it's a by design it
48:13 creates a distance in time but you're
48:16 going to be able to turn them into
48:18 ghosts and you have a lot of other
48:19 little dots you gotta eat up before the
48:21 game levels over plus they give you a
48:24 little tchotchkes a little cherries
48:26 little slices of watermelon or whatever
48:28 which will make you go after that thing
48:30 baiting you away from these other four
48:34 corners that will allow you to be
48:35 invincible those smaller game designs
48:38 allowed their brains to hone the design
48:44 today it is very very tough because we
48:49 are now immolating reality most the time
48:51 in these video games right the war games
48:53 are phenomenal the science fiction games
48:55 are phenomenal now you were simulating
48:58 reality and reality is already so
49:01 complex that you know it's tough plus
49:05 when you tell the gamers this is going
49:07 to be photo real oh my god the amount of
49:11 money you just spent with those few
49:13 words if it's going to be photo real
49:15 right you quadrupled your budget
49:18 automatically and you're gonna let the
49:20 public
49:21 most likely because you're not gonna be
49:22 able to actually achieve it now they're
49:25 getting close right they're getting
49:26 SuperDuper close with these games and so
49:29 it starts to become a bit like a movie
49:31 like my movie episode where I said look
49:34 what is entertainment it's being
49:36 redefined it's no longer a good story
49:38 you're going for a bunch of special
49:40 effects maybe some sound effects and a
49:42 soundtrack that's it you don't even
49:44 remember what the movies about what
49:47 games are kind of slipping into that
49:49 because the stories are in some cases
49:54 very dry or very repetitive Nintendo I
49:58 promise I was gonna bring them back in
50:00 the conversation here's how they roll at
50:02 least how they used to roll I think they
50:04 still do it in Japan as I understand it
50:07 the game designers of Nintendo one as
50:11 I've been told they were lab coats and
50:13 they conduct numerous psychological
50:18 experiments on those little tiny game
50:21 elements to see what makes your brain
50:24 feel good and how fast they can make you
50:26 feel good before you start to lose your
50:28 addiction to that thing because you're
50:30 running out of chemicals in your body so
50:32 something I teach in college you have a
50:34 certain amount of dopamine you can
50:36 create and you could drain it every
50:39 second but then you know it's a little
50:41 packet a dopamine is less and so the
50:43 amount of stimulation you can get is
50:45 less less less less and it becomes a
50:46 diminishing return for your brain starts
50:49 canceling it out headshot if everything
50:51 you did was a headshot every three or
50:53 four seconds in a video game you would
50:56 stop playing forever very quickly that
50:58 particular video game it has to be a
51:01 rare thing before you're gonna feel the
51:03 reward of it
51:04 why does zelda hold up why does zelda 1
51:07 2 maybe 3 hold up perfectly 1 & 2 is
51:12 just magical absolutely magical well
51:17 it's a big giant world you can't do
51:20 everything you can't get these giant
51:21 pops all the time because you got to do
51:24 things well the Warcraft had that
51:25 perfectly you get a bunch of quests oh
51:27 I'll go grind a bunch of zebras over
51:29 there grab a bunch of these things over
51:31 here do a FedEx delivery thing here I'm
51:33 going
51:34 give you this go give it to that guy
51:35 over there he's gonna give you something
51:36 else and take it over there and
51:38 eventually you learn how to fly yeah I
51:41 need something like that
51:42 it's a beautiful chain of command that
51:44 will help structure something reliable
51:47 within the video game to give you the
51:49 rewards that you want what I think is
51:51 really funny there's a game out there
51:53 called rust I've never played it but I
51:56 have watched I don't know how many hours
51:58 of the rust raids I've just rust
52:01 gameplay and it fascinates me that this
52:04 game is being played by I love watching
52:08 it I love watching it's fun it's fun to
52:10 watch but if you hadn't played this game
52:12 it's not that expensive you start off
52:14 naked I mean I I think you're completely
52:17 naked
52:17 and you run around and I think the first
52:20 weapon you can have is you've got to
52:21 find a rock on the ground picked it up
52:23 and you got to go hit someone on the
52:24 head with it before you're gonna get any
52:25 points for anything the only way you can
52:27 acquire anything without doing the rock
52:30 routine is to find someone else's stash
52:33 find a dead body find an open house
52:36 which would probably never happen unless
52:39 someone make a huge mistake but these
52:43 kids grind forever to get anything of
52:46 any substance pretty much like it would
52:48 be in the real world if we went into
52:49 some apocalyptic state yes so if you see
52:52 someone in rust wearing a really cool
52:54 gear and having an ak-47 with a paint
52:56 job on it and having a missile launcher
52:58 having any rounds for the missile
53:00 launcher these people have have teamed
53:04 up and been brutalized the amount of the
53:09 amount of suffering they've gone through
53:11 to play this game is fascinating to me
53:14 what that tells me is that think about
53:17 it anyone who plays rust well they're
53:20 obviously extremely good at video games
53:21 period if they're good at process
53:23 they're really good at everything else
53:24 let me tell you but they have every
53:30 other video game in the world to choose
53:32 from so why aren't they playing those
53:34 other games they have huge cinematic
53:36 stories you know what was it Metal Gear
53:38 Solid 3 I think had over 20 hours of
53:42 cutscenes they could be playing that or
53:45 the next one of it and the next one in
53:46 the next one no they're playing
53:47 rust because these sort of just like I
53:51 don't want all that I just want to have
53:53 something that's challenging that's
53:56 really challenging I don't even know if
53:58 there's a game of that magnitude that
54:02 they put a tremendous amount of R&D in
54:04 this game I mean hats off to the entire
54:07 development team and the mods that
54:08 people have created but these games are
54:12 more appealing it's fascinating
54:15 right now speaking of mods mods have
54:18 become a gigantic thing and and let me
54:20 just share with you the first mod I ever
54:24 heard of I'm sure there's others but
54:27 this is the first model ever heard of
54:29 and it is one of the most epic mods ever
54:32 made in history and it's called Duke
54:35 Nukem somebody took the quake engine or
54:40 starting oh sorry the doom engine excuse
54:42 me the doom engine came up with this
54:45 amazing fictional character Duke Nukem
54:48 put him in a world where he was fighting
54:51 these hogs you know I mean it was it -
54:54 damn those aliens smashed up my ride
54:57 mm-hmm and so you had this ludicrous
55:01 world you could go into a strip joint
55:04 and tip a stripper by the time the third
55:07 version came out I think it was a third
55:09 a second whatever that was you could
55:12 take a piss in a urinal you can see your
55:14 piss stream hitting a you're in the air
55:16 Oh hilarious you go to the mirror and
55:17 push the spacebar to be like you
55:19 something like who's that sexy guy or
55:21 something that right also have one of
55:25 the most hilarious voice tracks of any
55:31 game on planet the most lewd and crude
55:34 stuff a Duke could say you kill a guy
55:37 and you know your ass your face what's
55:39 the difference right just unbelievable
55:41 I'm gonna rip off your head and [ __ ]
55:43 down your neck balls of steel go see
55:46 balls of steel that old that old video
55:48 on YouTube just look up balls of steel
55:50 some guy tortured this woman with a Duke
55:54 Nukem and sound board and nobody knew
55:58 who Duke Nukem was you know
55:59 don't even mention the guys name the old
56:01 time that he's terrorizing this woman
56:03 with this thing he breaks her in the end
56:05 but boy this this woman's got a mouth on
56:07 her holy cow
56:09 but mods mods are huge some people
56:14 rather play mods than any of the games
56:15 that originally release there are
56:17 companies that make nothing but mods and
56:19 they make a tremendous amount of money
56:20 off the mods I don't know how you
56:23 compete with the kids out there they
56:24 have a lot of time on their hands one of
56:27 the funniest things that would happen at
56:29 Electronic Arts would be we would go off
56:31 we'd be playing something that Duke
56:36 Nukem or you know command & Conquer type
56:38 game and then we would go to lunch and
56:40 we know we're all high on our food and
56:44 all these these kids that work for EA
56:46 that that don't realize that they really
56:49 don't know anything about engineering
56:50 they don't really know anything about
56:51 game design some of them some people
56:56 I'll tell you there's two types of game
56:58 designers in the world just so you know
57:00 they're your brilliant conceptualist s--
57:04 someone that says i got a blank piece of
57:06 paper and i'm gonna create an amazing
57:09 world an amazing set of characters the
57:12 conflict it's going to have an endless
57:15 like a bottomless pit of story that can
57:17 occur at some type of MMO those are your
57:20 super geniuses those are the people that
57:24 pay the bills but then you'll have this
57:28 other phenomenon that happens that even
57:30 though that conceptualizing person and
57:32 there's a few that could do it soup the
57:34 nuts I mean start to finish was it they
57:36 I forgot the gentleman's name makes
57:38 Metal Gear Solid but he's he's one of
57:40 those uber geniuses then you have folks
57:44 that can't conceive of anything worth
57:47 playing and I mean at all but they are
57:50 amazing polishers tuners they get in and
57:54 they realize what you were trying to do
57:56 they immediately understand what the
57:58 hell you were trying to do and they're
58:00 like well that's great but okay let me
58:02 do the battle tables you know let me
58:03 figure out who how we work out swords
58:06 and armor and your stats and your body
58:08 and they make the game come to life you
58:12 need both
58:13 forces in your company if it's going to
58:16 be successful ego ego can kill a lot of
58:20 companies I will say that Electronic
58:22 Arts
58:23 it was fantastic at not acquiring egos I
58:28 was very very happy working there and
58:31 again if some folks had rumors of being
58:32 egotistical I'll just tell you one that
58:34 was a rumor
58:35 wasn't the case but when American McGee
58:39 joined us he was like a he made his mark
58:42 on quake he did a least quake to in
58:45 quake three he's an amazing level
58:47 designer phenomena but he's also a great
58:49 franchise inventor as well B came to our
58:51 company to do Alice and his original
58:54 vision for Alice was amazing the game
58:58 engines weren't quite up to his
58:59 visionary capabilities so he took it on
59:03 the chin with the first Alice release
59:05 but there was no no problem for him but
59:09 that guy internally a little bit
59:12 definitely externally got this
59:13 reputation for being a cocky guy having
59:17 a big ego and I've sat down with this
59:21 guy several times and this is an
59:24 important life lesson just so that you
59:25 know he's one of the most humble guys on
59:28 planet earth he soft-spoken he's
59:30 confident what he does but he's not a
59:32 jerk about it he never did anything in
59:34 front of me there ever would indicate
59:36 that he had some anything other than
59:39 confidence in what he did and even that
59:40 was pretty soft spoken I mean we would
59:43 hurl more compliments that the guy than
59:44 he would ever claim about his past it
59:47 was interesting and he had earned it he
59:48 had earned it
59:49 but we we spent millions on the PR for
59:54 Alice and so this guy is being literally
59:57 forced to be in front of cameras and
59:59 forced to pose for things and forced to
60:02 use his name on everything in the end
60:05 that rubbed off on him he didn't rub off
60:08 on it right so he got this weird
60:11 reputation for having this big ego he's
60:13 not like that at all he's a great guy
60:15 and he surrounds himself with equally
60:17 humble brilliant people constantly I
60:20 think he's been in China now for quite
60:22 some time but you know so that if you do
60:26 get someone with
60:27 ego and the ego guy I ever met was like
60:29 a coder for the web and he was useless
60:32 he was in and out so fast it wasn't even
60:33 funny
60:34 now ego and ego can be mistaken for
60:39 something else which is people who are
60:42 eccentric the I want to say it's a
60:48 company that it's an England that made
60:50 black and white it's lying something I
60:52 can trigger their name right now often
60:55 but you have eccentric people that are
60:58 like they're not big socialites right
61:01 they like to be in their world plus
61:03 they've got a huge list of things that
61:04 they want to do to make the next video
61:06 game and so they don't go out and hobnob
61:09 with everybody when you have a genius
61:12 like that or a group of them like this
61:13 as a video game company you do the
61:16 Marvel thing you spend whatever money
61:18 it's gonna take to get them to the
61:21 finish line and if they need more money
61:23 and they're gonna delay it'll be worth
61:25 every penny because they're going to
61:28 bring in the revenue they're gonna
61:29 invent a franchise and again what you
61:31 really want
61:32 in terms of a video game to be
61:35 successful as a game that everyone who
61:38 plays that type of game has to own the
61:41 game they can't just play it out of
61:43 friends and go home they're gonna play
61:45 it out their friends drive straight to a
61:46 place like a game stops and have to wait
61:48 for the mail and they take it home
61:50 that's a great video game so how do we
61:53 fix this hmm that's tough it's a
61:58 systemic problem of multiple dimensions
62:01 right what can't we fix well we probably
62:06 can't fix the fact that there are
62:07 probably too many platforms out there
62:09 you have the PCs we have all the mobile
62:13 tablet devices we've got jeez at least
62:16 three super duper consoles VR is trying
62:21 to be a layer on top of that but VR
62:23 requires so much horsepower that
62:25 whatever you get out of a console is
62:27 kind of mean it's okay
62:28 when I taught with my buddy Richard
62:32 Taylor the first accredited VR class at
62:35 Chapman University a big film school
62:38 they had one computer when we got
62:41 that was capable of running a VR headset
62:44 my students said nomen have all been
62:46 given free headsets and they all gave
62:48 them away because they don't have a
62:49 system at home and anymore to play
62:50 because Tim Cook keeps saying it's a
62:52 post PC era get rid of your PCs then
62:55 they had to release the iMac Pro so you
62:57 could use a headset on it and they price
62:58 it at the base model of five thousand
63:00 dollars give me a break
63:02 if you know how to build a PC you know
63:04 you could build a very nice VR headset
63:08 PC for way under five grand and it's
63:11 gonna be built your way right VR isn't
63:15 the solution all the old farts that are
63:18 like 55 and older they're telling you AR
63:21 AR augmented reality is gonna be
63:23 everything seriously run it Ford
63:26 run it for it as an inventor of
63:28 technology you can have all the money
63:30 you want in the world what are you gonna
63:31 use VR maybe my car safely maybe project
63:36 it up on my windshield so that I can you
63:39 know what my Google Maps is lovely
63:41 telling me to you know turn right here
63:43 turn left there but it's also got a not
63:45 getting the way of a little kid walking
63:47 in front of my car it can't give me the
63:50 indication I can go when I'm actually at
63:52 a stoplight so the amount of the amount
63:55 of refinement of AR is Jesus 20 years
63:58 out if they haul ass maybe ten years on
64:00 it's not a solution for what we're
64:03 talking about we are going to remain
64:05 staring at screens letting the screen
64:09 psychologically adopt our visual cortex
64:12 to the point we don't see anything
64:13 around the screen you know that happens
64:14 when you play a video game even your
64:16 little tiny telephone your mind will
64:19 adopt the phone screen as your
64:20 full-blown vision it's interesting it's
64:23 a phenomenon your brain has to pick
64:26 reality it does and it picks the screen
64:29 when it can plus the screens are
64:30 flickering at 60 frames a second which
64:32 is hypnotic for the mind the other one
64:36 would be to probably deflate the number
64:40 of games in a particular studio now
64:44 there's a lot of studios that make one
64:45 game and all they do is they give it to
64:48 the distributor and it goes out the door
64:49 so you'll see Activision and then the
64:51 other game title but if you go to that
64:53 studio
64:54 all they make is that game and that's
64:57 why those games are typically the most
64:59 powerful games you can have in the
65:01 industry now EA believe it or not is
65:03 sort of like that you know I think
65:05 Tiburon Florida still makes Madden I
65:08 think EA Canada still makes a ton of all
65:11 the other games but they have Studios
65:13 everywhere sometimes franchises just run
65:17 their course so what they need to do
65:20 potentially is like the BBC the BBC has
65:25 an interesting thing that they do with
65:26 their television shows on what is a
65:28 channel for I think that's the channel
65:31 they will make a very famous series on
65:35 TV everybody loves it but when they get
65:38 to the next season and they go Kate will
65:40 show us what you have show us with the
65:41 storylines that kind of thinking about
65:43 this thinking about that BBC goes well
65:45 we're gonna mothball it until you really
65:48 have something substantial we're here
65:51 for you as soon as you want to make that
65:52 but you don't seem like you have your
65:53 ducks in a row
65:55 God's BT same thing with video games
65:59 some games Nintendo has been pretty
66:04 fantastic at holding back their titles
66:07 until they've got something super
66:08 special to show you
66:09 Zelda for instance held back until
66:12 they're gonna reinvent it in some 3d way
66:15 and then it's got to have the same super
66:17 adventurous feel to it
66:19 remember Squaresoft which is now Square
66:22 Enix created the Final Fantasy series
66:25 well if you were into those series
66:28 you'll know that some of them are
66:30 fantastic some homework crap they'd be
66:32 fantastic then they'd be crap and be
66:33 fantastic again sometimes the fantastic
66:36 part would only be the story and the
66:37 cutscenes and the gameplay is so boring
66:39 that you're like eh this is old I could
66:42 tell you that Electronic Arts mothballed
66:44 a lot of titles in the 90s that are
66:47 ready to be rebooted they had was at the
66:52 Jane series right isn't Jane's james's
66:54 the military journal that comes out that
66:56 documents all of the and I apologize if
67:00 they've done this and I'm just unaware
67:02 of it but it used to be the Jane series
67:04 and it was a bunch of war games
67:07 then they had some wargames that were
67:10 kind of spoofy and they kind of fun and
67:11 I forgot the name of this one that we we
67:14 only sold 750,000 copies so we didn't
67:16 hit platinum and so EA said well that
67:18 just cost us too much money one of them
67:20 only sold 350,000 copies and let me tell
67:23 you if you and I got together and made a
67:25 video game and this sold 350,000 copies
67:28 at $39 a piece back in the day we don't
67:33 only would be living well but we would
67:35 definitely have enough money to make the
67:36 sequel unfortunately when an executive
67:40 who doesn't play video games starts
67:42 running a video game company which
67:44 unfortunately is the case for almost
67:46 well every video game company that's
67:49 failing right now go to their top
67:50 executives and go how many video games
67:52 do you play oh well maybe that's the
67:54 problem you could tell it turd from a
67:57 bar of gold if your life depended up
67:59 your kid's life's depended on it you're
68:01 gonna fail that test so what do they get
68:03 told the word epic starts destroying
68:06 their life it's gonna be epic it's gonna
68:08 be badass that's another one it's gonna
68:10 be badass can be bad gonna be epic
68:12 badass epic epic badass it's not it's
68:15 not at all epic about us you know what
68:17 it is it's trivial it's cliche and it's
68:19 tired there's usually what epic
68:21 translates to ethic would be someone who
68:28 hasn't made a game maybe 10 years who's
68:31 been thinking about it and thinking
68:32 about it thinking about it and they're
68:33 like I've been watching all this cliches
68:35 circle each other and eat each other
68:37 alive I've seen these game companies go
68:40 down the tubes it used to be on top and
68:43 I'm thinking and then BOOM this new
68:47 thing comes out that just blows
68:48 everything away take like World of
68:49 Warcraft you know I did a whole episode
68:52 on why I think it was tanking recently
68:54 right I'm a huge fan of the franchise
68:56 trust me
68:57 I played the game for 13 years straight
68:59 non-stop I've got 9 top level characters
69:02 not including the last expansion which I
69:05 couldn't possibly play actually Reese
69:07 absque ribe to try and play it again it
69:09 was like just born me to death every
69:11 friend I know build out of the game it's
69:13 horrible
69:14 but what have they been doing with will
69:16 to quit will craft right they've been
69:18 telling the same boring [ __ ] lower
69:20 for
69:21 ever and ever and ever and then promised
69:23 you they're gonna make seven more of the
69:25 same lore today they'll just tell you oh
69:27 yeah we got all planned out we got the
69:29 next ten years of World of Warcraft
69:30 planned out it's like really if you can
69:33 even do that you probably just spelled
69:36 failure for your franchise but what is
69:40 what is all the work I've been for a
69:42 really long time well two things it's
69:46 been a comedy which may be the essence
69:48 you don't mess with but I don't know but
69:51 it's also looked like a game made at a
69:53 2004 it's got an antiquated engine
69:56 antiquated battle scenes cuz everything
69:59 stopped down third person right it just
70:02 feels like you're playing dad's
70:03 chessboard from 1965 right your
70:06 Grandpa's bored I tried to make a movie
70:09 of it yeah I tried to make the expansion
70:13 feed the movie yeah what haven't they
70:17 done let's reset the whole clock let's
70:21 say water warcraft gets canceled
70:23 forwards there but you know whatever
70:25 they're not gonna update it for ten
70:27 years they're not gonna release a new
70:30 one and they're gonna hunker down and
70:33 create a brand new engine and this
70:35 engine is going to be as amazingly
70:39 realistic as it can possibly be
70:43 you're in Orgrimmar in the first shot of
70:46 this new game you're not in a cutscene
70:48 but goddamn it you think you're in a
70:50 cutscene because it looks so good it's
70:53 not a very good day weather-wise there's
70:56 clouds there's a little bit of rain hell
70:59 maybe there's even a lot of rain you
71:02 walk up on your first quest giver this
71:07 dude is not exactly happy to see he
71:12 looks like he's been in a thousand Wars
71:14 you walk up on him and you can see the
71:17 subdermal tissue in his face and he
71:20 looks at you just like Thanos and
71:22 in-game right and he just looks up at
71:24 you and he's just like what do you want
71:25 you know one of those faces and arranged
71:28 just sprinkling down his face his armor
71:31 would shine if it was clean but it's not
71:34 the city is full of life it's got all
71:37 kinds of wagons going by and chickens
71:40 flapping it here and there someone's
71:42 cutting a head off something to bake it
71:45 for you some rat head or something
71:46 because that's what they sell over there
71:48 you take it to a level of dimension
71:51 which would be the next fantasy that's
71:53 not being satisfied in the engine how
71:56 many of you playing World of Warcraft
71:58 they could really apply this to any game
72:00 that you want but it looks like a video
72:02 game it looks ancient and you're
72:05 thinking jeez how fun would it be to
72:08 teleport into that world and actually be
72:11 there be there in all of its grit and
72:15 grime you step on to the to the
72:18 floorboards of the auction house and you
72:19 just you hear the muddy you know grain
72:23 underneath your feet crushing because
72:25 you happen to step in a puddle the other
72:27 guy didn't the the Goblin that's in
72:30 there sounded to you he's relatively dry
72:32 and clean so he's got a whole different
72:33 thing
72:34 maybe there's a VR element to it in ten
72:37 years it's worth putting headset on if
72:41 you have a VR the situation then you're
72:44 gonna shoot the movie shoot the game
72:45 excuse me like a movie whether it's a
72:47 few like little like 3d effect shots
72:49 keys it might make you a jump a little
72:51 bit some floors some ceiling assembly
72:54 that's gonna come swinging by your head
72:56 every once in a while because that's
72:57 what it does like oh my god what's that
73:00 you know get you get on your mount and
73:04 your mount feels like an animal it has
73:08 all those little sounds that animals
73:10 have and its feet crunch on the ground
73:12 in a particular way and it steps in a
73:13 puddle and it goes splat instead of
73:16 smoosh your you stop your animal in the
73:20 middle of a wheat grass or a sorry a Sun
73:23 grass field right and you can just stop
73:26 and listen and the Sun grass just bangs
73:29 into itself and makes that beautiful
73:30 harmony in your brain now start telling
73:34 stories you start going into that
73:37 dungeon it's a whole lot scarier the
73:42 potential in your mind for what could be
73:45 in that dungeon is firing off like crazy
73:48 but the game designers actually are
73:49 gonna blow you away with what you
73:51 thought you were gonna see and what you
73:53 end up seeing pulling back on some of
73:55 these franchises mothballing them for a
73:58 little while or maybe forever
74:01 reinventing ya spending a tremendous
74:04 amount of money but then what you do for
74:08 the franchise's that are the staple diet
74:10 of what you're doing maybe the first
74:13 thing you do is cancel all the crap just
74:16 put it on moth balls and then cancel but
74:18 you know it's like well like ask you
74:19 it's really a blizzard they held back
74:21 for 10 years 15 years on games and blew
74:24 our minds when the sequel's came out hey
74:26 that was a great formula wasn't it you
74:29 get your staple games dialed in
74:32 tightened up updated listen to your
74:36 players if anything they're not
74:38 marketing firms listen to the players
74:40 listen to your own heart start taking it
74:42 way beyond what you think you can do so
74:44 that even if you don't meet that goal
74:46 what she ended up achieving was the epic
74:50 thing that you thought you were talking
74:52 about and you created another boring
74:53 sequel of the game the other thing that
74:56 kills the video game company our
74:58 shareholders once your company gets so
75:02 big that you go public and you've got a
75:03 stock share you're no longer making
75:06 games anymore you're trying to make
75:08 money and you will [ __ ] yourself out to
75:12 anything that seems like it's an easy
75:14 sell Apple computer and there's trading
75:18 over 200 bucks right now so good for
75:20 them
75:20 but they have pulled out every single
75:23 trick in the book to make money and not
75:26 making new products right and get the
75:29 new Mac Pro that's supposed to come out
75:31 things gonna cost so much no one's gonna
75:33 buy it I'm really sorry it's just not
75:35 gonna happen
75:35 do I want hell ya want one well he ever
75:38 spend that kind of money on one not
75:41 unless you know rain turns into money
75:43 it's not even smart if you have the
75:46 money because you can get a better
75:48 machine on a PC you get laptops that are
75:50 gonna smoke that Mac Pro it's just true
75:54 they're loud they're big they're thick
75:55 and they cost about 4 grand but it's
75:57 going to be 6 grand less than that Mac
75:59 bro and Apple thinks that compete
76:02 should only last two years that's what a
76:04 Mac Genius told me at their store well
76:07 hell that's their philosophy are you
76:10 willing to pay five grand a year for our
76:11 computer before it starts to die
76:14 it may be three years if your Apple
76:16 coverage is still effective now for the
76:20 game companies that are getting it right
76:22 you know I think I would hope that they
76:25 would heed all of these concerns and
76:27 really really pay attention to the
76:29 companies that have gone under who were
76:31 on top because the one I think genetic
76:36 flaw of video game companies is that
76:38 they perceive the age of those creating
76:42 the games as a as a I don't know a
76:47 detriment to the company
76:48 the one thing that lect Roenick arts did
76:51 well was hire senior producers guys in
76:54 their 40s 50s and now they have some
76:56 folks in their 60s still cranking out
76:59 the best titles in these companies
77:02 because they've seen it all they can
77:04 smell crap they know what a great game
77:07 feels like they know how to see the
77:08 fundamentals of a games design it's
77:10 interesting with a bunch of kids here's
77:13 your problem what can you do with a
77:16 little kid you can steal their nose
77:18 can't you you can disconnect your thumb
77:20 off of your hand right and they're just
77:22 completely blown away
77:23 you can grab all those little card
77:25 tricks that don't work with the dholtze
77:26 and play them on kids and they
77:28 completely believe it well that's
77:30 exactly what happens with kids who get
77:32 into these video game companies because
77:35 they're not always the best players in
77:36 the world if the best players in the
77:38 world could work for video game
77:39 companies maybe they have a design
77:41 instinct maybe at best they're like
77:43 great testers to say that was totally
77:46 crap or that was fantastic why was it
77:48 fantastic why was it better than the
77:50 last version of the game and listen to
77:51 what they say and see if there's
77:52 anything the real distinction there
77:54 because it might be they're such a
77:55 fanboy you can't get a decent opinion at
77:58 if any one Apple surrounds itself and in
78:01 infects its company with fanboys as
78:04 employees and a problem with that is Tim
78:09 Cook could take a crap on a piece of
78:10 done on a piece of paper and push it out
78:12 on a table and go what do you guys think
78:13 it's my new thing and they're gonna be
78:15 all too
78:16 so great it's so great you know I love
78:21 all your political and personal agendas
78:22 too by the way gotta come to your house
78:25 and eat cookies and milk a good season
78:28 game designer gets better with age right
78:31 they do they simply do I know it's like
78:33 oh maybe I'm promoting my own age
78:35 bracket but it's the truth we've seen it
78:38 all we know color palettes that have
78:41 that have become cliche you know verbal
78:44 phrases that are cliche
78:46 you know if somehow you could turn off
78:48 all video games for 20 years and then
78:50 turn them all back on yeah sure you
78:52 could bring out all those old tricks and
78:54 play them over again but that's not
78:55 what's going on
78:56 everyone's getting completely exhausted
78:58 of everything that's out there same
79:01 thing with television and movies same
79:03 thing so people are gonna have to get
79:06 back to fundamentals quality over
79:09 quantity but it's hard to tell the
79:12 company with shareholders that you're
79:14 not going to release 130 games this year
79:16 a lot of game companies in order to fill
79:19 those orders of those slots in their
79:22 release pool they go out and license a
79:27 game or buy the company it's still crap
79:30 the other thing that companies don't
79:32 have is usually especially like a big
79:35 giant company they usually don't have
79:38 one person overseeing what it is to be
79:42 that company to say this is an EA game
79:46 this is not a EA game this is an
79:48 Activision game this is not an
79:50 Activision game we don't distribute this
79:52 crap
79:52 now obviously someone is saying
79:54 something like that but to make it an an
79:57 absolute objective to say like the old
79:59 film studios right again Universal
80:01 movies were Universal movies 20 Century
80:05 Fox MGM all these companies knew that
80:07 there were movies that they were relying
80:09 on to make and so that's what they were
80:13 really good at they they cracked those
80:15 formulas when a company is so diverse
80:18 with so many different games they just
80:21 have to trust people okay well what's
80:24 that like trusting people is your game
80:28 going to be good
80:29 oh yes sir it's gonna be so good okay
80:32 see you next week see you next month see
80:35 you next quarter whatever hope it does
80:37 well and then the game goes out in tanks
80:39 and then they go back and half the
80:40 conversation some post-mortem and it's
80:42 like well you know we thought that that
80:44 was you know you know what happened was
80:45 that other company came up with that
80:47 game first and so they kind of blew our
80:48 wad before I added that those things
80:51 really happen but sometimes it's a bunch
80:53 of BS what companies get real big and go
80:57 public they have to release titles on a
81:00 particular interval to keep this stock
81:03 stocks up to keep the shareholders happy
81:06 and that's when you get crap I know you
81:10 feel me on this let me know what you
81:12 think in the comments if you play video
81:14 games I'm sure a ton of you have played
81:15 here's a couple ways to think about your
81:17 comment one if you're a old coin-op
81:20 person and you hate video games and the
81:22 computers let me know that reason if you
81:24 used to play video games and you no
81:25 longer play them anymore on any platform
81:27 to speak of let me know why you think
81:30 you quit what was the fundamental reason
81:32 and if your reason was I just got busy
81:34 well we all have that answer is probably
81:35 not worth sharing but if there's some
81:38 specific thing about the games their
81:39 integrity their fun that's what I'd like
81:42 to hear and if you think there was a
81:45 game that was fantastic that they never
81:48 sequel a sequel badly let me know that
81:52 title because I think that would be
81:53 interesting data I'm not into I'm not
81:56 involved with any video game companies
81:57 right now I just think would be
81:59 interesting to sort of delve into other
82:02 people's ideas me I don't play any
82:06 console games anymore used to play the
82:09 ps3 like crazy never got the Xbox
82:12 because when I had the ps3 xbox had the
82:14 glowing you know crash problems I never
82:17 got into that heard the 360s fantastic I
82:19 definitely watch a lot of game reviews I
82:22 listen to a bunch of people's reviews I
82:24 think there's a reason why these game
82:26 companies are going out I mean the game
82:28 companies but the the retailers are
82:30 going out of business I think it does go
82:33 against the notion of just straight
82:36 internet beating brick and mortar I
82:38 think it's because the industry itself
82:40 is sagging when I go on to a mobile
82:43 or it's the most depressing experience
82:45 ever because these games suck I don't
82:49 know
82:49 99.9% at the time and I really want them
82:52 to succeed Apple will take a game and
82:55 say this is one of the best games ever
82:56 and you jump into it you're like oh it's
82:58 an artsy fartsy game which is why you
83:00 thought it was great it looks really
83:02 different but the gameplay is atrocious
83:03 especially on these laptops are these
83:06 laptops that probably okay but on the
83:09 the tablets and the phones the
83:10 interfaces are just [ __ ] you know
83:13 there's that great game called robot
83:16 warriors out there the team making this
83:20 game has done a great job of course it's
83:22 a microtransaction game right
83:24 microtransactions I think have killed
83:26 gaming as well right people are supposed
83:28 to spend $10,000 on a game that they
83:31 downloaded for free it's insane
83:32 it happens every day happens every day
83:34 people throw in you know $1000 of their
83:38 hard-earned money and they get way ahead
83:40 of everyone else and then it's just
83:41 boring for them it's boring because
83:44 they're winning all the time or their
83:45 bump and it gets another guy who put two
83:47 thousand dollars in and you know you're
83:49 losing not because of your skill but
83:50 because someone spent a ton of money
83:52 this was made very famous in Asia
83:54 so microtransactions probably should
83:57 have mentioned that I think that is
83:58 something that only happens on mobile
84:01 it's only tolerated on mobile you know
84:03 it's nice to have a little expansion
84:04 back that's why steam I think is
84:06 fantastic fallout for the whole Fallout
84:09 franchise like so many other games you
84:12 finish their core story you buy these
84:14 expansion packs boom it's fantastic a
84:17 whole nother wing on the on the house
84:19 gets built and all know the world you
84:20 can teleport to it's fantastic
84:22 some of them are gifts to keep on giving
84:25 and some of them you just burn them up
84:26 and it's over why Bethesda doesn't
84:28 continue to make expansion packs with a
84:30 special team like mods he'll even pay
84:33 some of the normal folks out there
84:34 playing the game when you play the game
84:37 you could download all the mods in the
84:39 game why not just purchase one of those
84:40 sell it through the Bethesda software
84:44 franchise and it's said it's a trusted
84:47 mod you know anyway I want to know as
84:50 much as you can share about your opinion
84:52 of this because it's just a fascinating
84:53 thing it's an amazing industry
84:56 promotes a lot of innovation you know
84:59 without the video game industry military
85:00 simulations would suck okay it has
85:04 literally come out of that and if
85:05 weren't for the video game industry your
85:07 computer would never get any faster you
85:10 don't need a faster computer to browse
85:11 the Internet write a letter maybe the
85:13 video editor do some special effects or
85:16 something like that but that's how the
85:17 other side of it is the film effects
85:19 industry pushes the processor teams to
85:23 get faster and faster and faster
85:24 but what if Intel just said this is it
85:27 this is as fast as we can go well their
85:29 sales would go down right what if your
85:32 toothpaste said that's as good as we can
85:33 make it maybe you'd still buy it it's
85:36 interesting right said anyway if you
85:40 have been to deep thoughts radio.com
85:41 please go there's two feeds for video
85:44 let me just put this way the feeds for
85:46 video their audio social media you have
85:49 a lakh Facebook group how they recommend
85:50 you get in there we have two ways to
85:53 donate to the page a remastered season

85:57 search field category list have some fun

86:01 improvements to that as the year
86:02 progresses but right now I'm stuck
86:03 inside the season five intro today's
86:07 date is August 6th it's about two
