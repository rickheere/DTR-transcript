00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts today I am
00:41 going to take a crack at a reality known
00:48 as biophotons for those of you wondering
00:52 what that is there are essentially two
00:56 schools of research and this happened
01:01 when I did multiverse too because when
01:04 you have a this is actually less
01:07 theoretical than multiverse when you
01:08 have some of these theoretical or
01:10 emerging Sciences you have schools of
01:12 thought that move in from different
01:14 universities from different whatever
01:17 institutions and they kind of go in
01:20 different directions based on their
01:22 Charter and so they will claim ownership
01:25 over a particular term and a particular
01:27 concept right so the multiverse I forgot
01:31 that there are several so many theories
01:34 about multi versing based on so many
01:36 different approaches that it got
01:38 confusing for some folks so the study of
01:41 biophotons by itself as a pure research
01:44 project is to merely look at the
01:46 photoelectric emissions from human cells
01:50 or organic cells in plants and insects
01:54 you know there's things on the bottom
01:56 the ocean that glow there's lightning
01:58 bugs they have butts that glow right but
02:02 those are and you know the ones the fish
02:04 at the bottom of the ocean and lightning
02:05 bugs you can see with your own two eyes
02:07 the bioelectric signatures that we get
02:10 out of all living tissue
02:13 and it's living tissue not your steel
02:16 desk right so it's very interesting
02:18 where we're going with this then there's
02:21 bio photonics which is the study of
02:26 whether or not sunlight plays a direct
02:31 role in healing the body and nourishing
02:34 the body now let me just throw a real
02:37 quick concept at you that isn't it
02:41 interesting how we typically are pretty
02:43 healthy in the summertime and as soon as
02:46 winter rolls around we get sick now
02:50 today there's a lot of factors in that
02:52 today we have planes that spray stuff in
02:55 the sky which always coincides with mass
02:59 illness in your area like I said in a
03:03 really old episode I have two ways of
03:06 measuring this it'll get cold it'll be
03:10 cold for a month you used to they used
03:13 to let it get cold for about a month
03:14 before they'd start spraying when I had
03:19 two offices and about 30 employees from
03:21 my game company they would spray my
03:23 entire company be healthy and they'd
03:26 spray really bad here in Orange County
03:28 in LA and I'd do a you know trek back
03:31 and forth once a week at least and I'd
03:33 tell the employees I'd say you know
03:36 hunker down on your vitamin C your zinc
03:38 gets good sleep because it's coming
03:41 you just got sprayed and they laugh and
03:43 then everyone would get sick as well as
03:48 that example and actually hearing it
03:51 from urgent care doctors that said yeah
03:55 it's a really bizarre spike and everyone
03:58 getting sick all of a sudden and then I
04:01 told the doctor to start looking at
04:02 planes that spray in this guy and he
04:04 could see this guy do 60,000 foot stare
04:06 because it's somehow he had been looking
04:08 at it and didn't know the correlation
04:09 really funny but I have some friends of
04:12 mine up in LA we're in the film business
04:15 they're very eclectic people they don't
04:17 get out much they don't shake hands and
04:19 they would get sick as well and everyone
04:23 had an upper respiratory problem in the
04:25 the less that people took vitamins like
04:28 powdered time-release vitamin C they it
04:33 will go from their nose to the throat to
04:35 the chest and then when it's sat in the
04:36 chest it would go one two three months
04:40 and when I found out the trick of C I
04:43 just stopped it in its tracks
04:45 unbelievable
04:46 think about it the days get shorter
04:49 don't they
04:50 daylight savings time there's no goddamn
04:53 reason in the world where that should
04:55 still be out there but it is putting us
04:59 in further darkness so we come home
05:03 there's nothing left the days get pretty
05:06 darn short up until the winter solstice
05:08 it was kind of hard to evade some of
05:11 that but I wanted to loop around this
05:15 theory okay because you've pretty much
05:17 heard the the basic theory which is hey
05:22 everything that's alive seems to emit
05:24 light on one frequency or another right
05:27 and you know what I always say on this
05:30 show is to remind you that in the ether
05:34 fabric of the universe light is nothing
05:36 more than a verbal reaction it is like
05:39 the ripple in the pond if I sent you out
05:41 there into the ponds and I skipped a
05:43 bunch of rocks and I said bring back the
05:45 ripples to me you would look at me like
05:47 I'm crazy that's the exact same thing if
05:50 I say bring back the photons to me but
05:54 you have one trick you can do in this
05:56 reality for us which is to bring me a
05:58 torch that has non verbal ether
06:04 particles stuck in these four Texel
06:06 loops that give them their designation
06:08 as atoms that are thermal izing and
06:11 becoming light now depending on how
06:15 nerdy you are with this show and I
06:18 commend you if you are you'll hear you
06:22 will have heard me mention probably half
06:25 a dozen times that the gentleman who
06:27 built Coral Castle in Florida for those
06:31 of you don't know the one sentence in
06:33 ops this is 110 pound man built probably
06:36 if you total up all the coral
06:39 rock that he used to build this castle
06:41 but he wrote a paper on magnetism that
06:45 you can download online and it says that
06:49 we have all been duped about the
06:51 construction of it Adam and that at the
06:54 center of an atom is a photon
06:57 here's wild about that for me the
07:01 volumes and volumes of books and classes
07:04 I've taken and research that I've done
07:06 in every derivation of physics no one's
07:13 ever said that in my travels I watched
07:17 all of Eric Dollard stuff one of the
07:19 most amazing men who has resurrected the
07:22 old documents from Faraday to Tesla the
07:25 Steinmetz and I didn't hear him say that
07:29 fascinating now why the Coral Castle guy
07:32 said that we are still speculating these
07:37 guys that seem to create these amazing
07:40 things for whatever reason covet they
07:43 hide their information he was brilliant
07:46 and left behind what we believed to be
07:48 an amazing road map as to how he built
07:52 the place with quadratic pine numbers
07:55 and all kinds of wild stuff that
07:58 contributed to his magnetic will in his
08:02 warehouse generating pretty much as much
08:04 electricity as he needed to move these
08:05 rocks as well as the rocks themselves
08:09 definitely being hooked at the pulleys
08:11 and stuff but these rocks were so
08:13 absolutely heavy that a lot of us are
08:15 convinced that the pictures that we see
08:17 of the pulley system based on three
08:21 probably 10 by 10 tree trunks were not
08:25 strong enough to lift some of the rocks
08:27 that he had because they were so massive
08:29 plus he always had an electrical box on
08:31 the top and wires coming down and I
08:34 believe in my sacred geometry episode I
08:39 explained why I think what I think he
08:42 was doing but he only worked at night
08:44 and he said that when asked why did you
08:48 work at night to build your castle he
08:49 said well one it's a natural cover from
08:53 and to it it's because the son fights my
08:58 technique of moving these rocks which is
09:02 very interesting
09:04 now I'm gonna go down just some
09:08 theoretical things I'm gonna talk in
09:11 some speculative conspiratorial speech
09:15 I'm not trying to create any panic in
09:18 anyone but I think that if you were to
09:20 listen to this and heed the ideas and
09:23 test them out for yourself you could
09:24 find out whether or not there's any
09:25 truth to this for yourself I think the
09:29 Sun is a healing beautiful thing I think
09:34 that when I get Sun on my face doing
09:37 these shows for you guys I'm also being
09:41 healed and I don't mean in some magical
09:44 way that I've got some tumor hanging off
09:46 the front of my face and disappears I
09:48 just think my pine oil gland fires my
09:50 vitamin D happens we're all deficient in
09:52 vitamin D and that's just this that's
09:55 just the beginning
09:56 but the more I spend time in the Sun the
09:59 more I feel one with the earth and I
10:03 feel much more patient with humanity and
10:06 some people could say it's because it's
10:07 heating you up it's heating up your
10:08 bloodstream you're getting calmed down
10:10 because you're you know you're
10:13 overheated you need to radiate hmm maybe
10:17 that's why it's so good but there's been
10:20 a string of videos published fairly
10:23 recently and in my research of just
10:25 bumping into things that they're
10:29 basically saying look at how many
10:31 attempts are made to block the Sun from
10:34 your body the chemtrails
10:38 well what's interesting about the
10:41 chemtrails as except for like fourth of
10:45 July in America do they spray because
10:48 everyone's outside barbecuing in the
10:50 summertime in America they really don't
10:52 spray that much in the wintertime they
10:54 go absolutely crazy but they're
10:56 obstructing the Sun with that stuff a
10:58 little bit right now for my money
11:01 I don't know how efficient that is I
11:03 actually think that it would be fairly
11:04 inefficient to block
11:06 the I don't know quadrillions of photons
11:09 that hit us every second I think putting
11:13 a particulate in the air is probably the
11:15 number one reason why it would make you
11:16 sick right again
11:18 there's there's evidence of you know
11:21 fibers and all kinds of stuff dropping
11:23 out of these things as well but honestly
11:27 if you're just ingesting a particulate
11:29 you are not healthy because your immune
11:30 system is taxed and you will catch
11:32 whatever's going around so but back to
11:37 photons when I was a kid in the 70s
11:41 sunscreen was wasn't around really you
11:44 put on cocoa butter and you put on
11:47 lotions that were oils to make you tan
11:50 better I guess changed the frequency
11:54 such that you tan browner it seems I
11:57 have a buddy of mine he's a rocker when
11:59 we go to Havasu
12:00 he puts the puts on the the oil he
12:05 doesn't put any block on and he fares
12:08 better every single time then I'll put
12:12 the block on and I'd look like some
12:14 bizarre spray-paint accident by the end
12:17 of the day there's all the studies that
12:20 say that once the Sun hits sunblock it
12:24 turns toxic and so you're basically
12:27 toxifying your entire epidermis
12:30 absorbing all these chemicals go figure
12:34 when I was a kid I never ever heard
12:37 about skin disease the dermatology
12:40 starts to explode in the late 80s early
12:43 it started late 70s early 80s
12:45 girlfriends started going to it family
12:47 members start going to it and what was
12:49 sick about it was they were so excited
12:51 that someone told them they had a
12:53 cancerous cell on their face it was
12:55 Munchausen disease right it was a
12:58 hypochondriac she's just loving the
13:00 procedures and the acid baths on their
13:03 face and taking a mole off here and this
13:04 over there now it's an epidemic right as
13:09 a footnote it seems like the late 70s
13:12 were where I say I would say was at the
13:17 era in which health me
13:22 marginalized through medical advice
13:25 through super bad medical advice for
13:27 instance by the early 80s they were
13:29 telling all the people the world to stop
13:31 eating the yolk in the egg about five
13:36 years later Alzheimer's comes on the
13:38 scene like an epidemic
13:41 well the cholesterol that's in the yolk
13:44 of an egg is exactly the cholesterol
13:46 human being is supposed to be ingesting
13:48 it also supports the cholesterol in
13:50 which the brain is made out of I've
13:52 heard numbers like seventy six percent
13:54 of the gray matter in your brain is made
13:56 from the exact same cholesterol you find
13:58 in an egg in the yolk of an egg and when
14:01 you don't ingest good cholesterol the
14:03 cholesterol that is your brain that's
14:07 holding the neurons apart keeping them
14:09 spaced out so the wires don't touch each
14:10 other and short out that the sponge
14:14 disappears and all the wires start
14:16 connecting and then the phone call
14:17 that's supposed to go you know from your
14:19 brain to your toe gets diverted to your
14:22 left hand and when you're trying to
14:24 create cognitive thought you're just
14:27 totally confused about where you are who
14:29 you are and when you are until
14:32 eventually the neural tangling is they
14:34 call it gets so severe that your organs
14:36 begin to fail because they no longer can
14:40 sort out what they're supposed to do
14:41 because I keep getting erroneous
14:42 messages from the brain now organs
14:45 function by themselves but when they are
14:48 bombarded with electricity from random
14:49 sources they don't function well but the
14:53 reason why I'm jumping on this episode
14:55 now is that this guy from Coral Castle I
15:00 forgot his name it's the name is hard to
15:02 pronounce
15:04 his little paper that said there's a
15:07 photon at the center of an atom from a
15:09 guy that built Coral Castle I have not
15:11 been able to shake that but if you take
15:15 my theory about a photon being a verb
15:17 and not a noun then that's very
15:20 interesting what's that mean how do you
15:23 hold a verb in the center of an atom
15:27 that would mean that there's an outer
15:29 shell and another casing
15:31 that is somehow causing the verbal
15:35 reaction in the center most likely and
15:37 that's the relationship somehow there's
15:40 a force pushing in from the AE throw
15:42 winds and then there's this little
15:44 turbulent little vortex going on in the
15:46 center now before I go too much further
15:50 down that line there is something called
15:53 the einstein-rosen bridge and they
15:55 mentioned it in thor ragnarok which was
15:57 absolutely hilarious this is the the
16:00 theory that there are two dimensions or
16:03 at least a fold in the dimension that
16:05 you're in take a plane and think of that
16:08 as one reality and take a plane
16:09 underneath like two cloths right or
16:11 whatever and then you cut this hole
16:13 between them so there's like this funnel
16:14 between them the the movie Pacific Rim
16:17 also use this sort of theory and there
16:20 the way that the monsters were coming
16:21 out the bottom the ocean
16:23 that is a theory on a piece of paper
16:26 okay but when we think about the
16:29 cyclical nature of energy in the
16:31 universe we have to think about it like
16:34 if everything is in motion then it has
16:38 to have this path right for those of you
16:41 who study the was at the fire Rim and
16:44 the Pacific right this lava realm that
16:46 goes around the the plates or whatever
16:51 at the plates with the continents of the
16:52 world in the Pacific Ocean you'll be
16:55 familiar with the fact that if you were
16:57 to take a piece of lava and be able to
16:58 stick a flag in it and it moved it would
17:00 go all the way around and come back to
17:03 you having traveled to Hawaii and Japan
17:06 and Alaska and back to you in California
17:08 let's just say so whether or not energy
17:11 can be trapped in its ultimate form I'm
17:13 not sure when I did my episode on
17:17 gravity I introduced an idea that I
17:20 think is I've used it several times
17:22 since I came up with it for the episode
17:23 which is you know when I point at a
17:27 current you know those little vortexes
17:29 in say a stream in a river or maybe it
17:33 hits the support beam of a bridge and I
17:36 say hey do you know what that is and you
17:38 say oh that's a vortex that's a that's a
17:41 current and I can say to you know
17:45 just water but because it behaved like
17:48 it did you gave it the designation of a
17:50 current or vortex and so it could be
17:54 that what we see in the universe is
17:56 merely the the latest Ripple
17:59 the latest design in its path of
18:03 constantly renewing energy okay any of
18:07 you have played pinball there are places
18:10 in the pinball game where the ball moves
18:13 really really slow this is just kind of
18:15 floating around the playing field and
18:17 then there's areas where there's a
18:19 little spiral staircase and it goes
18:21 really fast
18:22 right and could change those levels or
18:23 does whatever it does right without a
18:25 kicker
18:25 so imagine II throw particles being that
18:28 and the only thing that you can see is
18:30 the path so you see the pinball machine
18:33 more than you see the ball hope that
18:35 makes sense but now think about what we
18:39 said in the multiverse episode about the
18:42 information wave of the universe the
18:44 fact that we we have proof that we have
18:49 an information wave if you're if you've
18:53 ever had information fall into your lap
18:56 right and I gave several examples then
18:58 episode I won't repeat the fact that
19:00 things burn is very interesting right
19:03 can burn for all kinds of reasons
19:06 once it thermal ices and turns into a
19:09 flame a couple things happen right so
19:13 you take a bunch of newspaper and you
19:16 light it on fire and you have that brief
19:18 moment where it thermal eise's into fire
19:20 in flames and then what's left
19:24 you know this carbon kind of skeleton of
19:28 the newspaper and it gets blown by the
19:30 wind or you can put your hand through it
19:32 so it looks like carbon was left behind
19:36 and a bunch of the inner components of
19:40 what that carbon was initially the
19:43 newspaper vaporized into the galaxy
19:46 right well what if that chain reaction
19:49 is nothing more than the undoing of the
19:54 photonic energy that's inside of
19:57 and Adam and it's simply releasing now
20:02 you might think yeah dude that makes
20:04 complete sense alright but what if I say
20:09 you're made of the same stuff and so you
20:13 have a tremendous amount of photons in
20:17 you you are a collection of photons but
20:22 they are encased in non illuminating
20:26 suitcases until we use the bio photonic
20:32 camera technique so these really
20:35 sensitive cameras to film you and all
20:39 sudden you start glowing now some of you
20:42 have seen these photographs and what's
20:44 interesting about it is you the subjects
20:49 that are filmed and you know some of the
20:50 most beautiful ones I've seen are plants
20:53 I'll try to find some photographs for
20:55 the YouTube video but what's interesting
20:58 is is it becomes apparent that the body
21:00 of whatever you're filming for this
21:02 experiment is not translucent it's
21:05 opaque you can't see through it and so
21:09 the only thing you're seeing is a bit of
21:10 the emissions off of the surface of
21:12 whatever is organic and where there is a
21:15 fold and the tissue like for a human
21:18 being it might be your eyelid or your
21:20 armpit or something in your nose it
21:24 becomes brighter because it seems as if
21:27 when there's a fold that it exposes more
21:30 of some well explosives multiple layers
21:33 of the cellular tissue like if you take
21:36 a carpet and a piece of carpet and you
21:39 fold it in half you know the fibers at
21:41 the top you can start seeing the little
21:42 stitching down there that the fibers are
21:44 attached to well just imagine there's
21:46 more fibers down there instead of
21:47 stitching so you'd be seeing more
21:49 photons escaping the cloth that is us
21:54 but now let's go back to this notion
21:56 that a photon is a verb and then let's
22:04 let's study the the most fundamental
22:08 definition of what is life
22:09 I usually don't think of my coffee table
22:14 over here that have used to have inside
22:16 my house that's outside house now I'm
22:17 painted green
22:18 I don't think of that thing as being
22:20 alive even though it was made it's made
22:22 of wood in it that wood used to be alive
22:24 I don't think of it as being alive
22:27 anymore
22:28 it's been cut off from its water supply
22:29 for almost two decades who knows how
22:33 long the wood sap before they built this
22:35 thing but when you play 20 questions and
22:39 you want to find out if something is
22:41 organic or a fundamental mineral like
22:46 steel or gold or something we think of
22:49 it as one of them is alive and one of
22:52 them isn't but what is the definition of
22:56 life if not a verb it is mass that has
23:01 consciousness right life is what we call
23:05 the illusion of consciousness I'm pretty
23:08 sure you had a thought this morning that
23:10 you're no longer thinking depending on
23:12 when you're seeing this video you've had
23:13 thoughts all day long they come and they
23:15 go right you are sort of this conduit
23:20 for consciousness for thoughts
23:23 remember our pinball machine idea you're
23:28 the pinball machine on the pinball
23:29 machine and the ball that's going
23:31 through could just simply be the verb of
23:34 a thought the illusion that we call
23:36 consciousness the illusion that we call
23:39 life is a verb so isn't it ironic that
23:44 when we do this biophoton photograph
23:49 photography right life gives off light
23:53 but inanimate objects depending on know
23:56 when they're created you know if you
23:58 built a sofa out of a bunch of ferns
24:00 that you harvested that day it probably
24:02 glow like crazy but as long as the sofa
24:05 is 100 years old it's not going to give
24:06 off any of these photonic signatures
24:10 because it's no longer alive no matter
24:12 what it's made out of a lot of us sit
24:15 around in the universe and we trot we
24:17 struggle to figure out you know what the
24:20 hell are we you know just that basic
24:22 thing of when you cry
24:23 out of all your paradigms and your
24:25 religions and your politics and you just
24:27 come back to humanity
24:29 you're trying to figure out what you're
24:31 made out of lately for me I I almost
24:37 feel silly being a human being
24:40 it's it's funny I like being alive as a
24:42 human being don't get me wrong but I
24:44 feel like every time I make an episode
24:47 with you guys every time I read your
24:48 comments every time I have a time to
24:50 kind of summarize at all and aggregate
24:52 data I feel more and more like a soul
24:57 and I feel like what I what I what I am
25:03 doing is I'm in this ritual of veneering
25:06 my soul I have this body that was given
25:11 to me by my parents millions of
25:14 decisions were made to make this body
25:16 look exactly the way you see it today
25:17 yours the same right we're born in a
25:21 certain place in time we have certain
25:23 opportunities certain privileges and
25:25 certain disadvantages you could start
25:28 out in a privileged realm and end up in
25:29 a disadvantaged realm and vice versa you
25:32 build your character than your
25:35 personality your persona on top of that
25:38 is Freud would say and then we live this
25:40 life and we choose careers but in its
25:45 core form you live inside your head
25:47 that's what's really going on right the
25:50 reason I mentioned this is that if
25:53 you're like me you're sort of looking
25:55 for that Disneyland map that is the kind
26:00 of character of the park you know but
26:03 what you want it to be is the character
26:05 of all of the universe and what it is
26:09 including you inside that that map you
26:11 know you you're just like the big where
26:15 the castle isn't the Disneyland map it's
26:17 you and everything that's floating
26:19 around you is your family your friends
26:21 your consciousness your subconsciousness
26:24 the the layer that explains what you're
26:27 built out of this idea that photons are
26:31 a super component of reality
26:35 is very very interesting if we ever
26:40 stopped metabolizing they usually call
26:43 us dead right they feel for the pulse
26:46 and the pulse is gone that soul has left
26:50 this vessel and is off someplace else
26:53 okay so anything that churns mass
27:01 anything that contributes to the verb of
27:03 movement that is organic life
27:07 well that might just end up being the
27:10 carrier wave for a lot more than just a
27:13 mechanical gas tank to keep the body
27:15 going a lot of you like me you struggled
27:21 with the notion of God and not that God
27:23 exists or doesn't exist some of you have
27:25 that that issue that's fine means you're
27:28 alive and you're thinking if you're not
27:31 struggling anymore and you think he
27:33 doesn't exist
27:34 that's one religion and if you don't
27:37 struggle anymore and you think he does
27:38 exist that's another religion right
27:39 another belief system but man has
27:42 created all kinds of stories to explain
27:45 this sort of spiritual endowment from
27:49 your Creator and there seems to be this
27:52 difference of living a life not
27:56 acknowledging a creator and living a
27:58 life where you do acknowledge your
28:00 Creator and for those of you who are
28:03 atheists I would have a lot more
28:07 understanding if you had at least
28:10 experienced some sort of what you might
28:14 call spiritual enlightenment or an
28:15 epiphany before choosing to be an
28:19 atheist but if you've never done it you
28:23 might try it or you might be actually
28:27 experiencing it but you just simply have
28:28 a different name for it for any of you
28:32 that have had intuition and I mean huge
28:35 intuition something either said go go go
28:38 or something said get out of here as
28:42 fast as you possibly can this is bad and
28:46 more than more than then can be
28:49 explained by sort of environmental input
28:53 there was a famous event that happened
28:55 in Wichita Kansas when I was a kid I
28:58 think if you look up Wichita Kansas
29:01 Hell's Angel Park riot you you will find
29:05 a moment in time that was even filmed by
29:07 the local news stations and I was there
29:09 that day as a child my mom and I lived
29:13 in a little town called Derby south of
29:16 Wichita and for whatever reason that day
29:20 she just said let's get out of the house
29:22 let's go to the park we never did that I
29:24 did my thing she did her thing I wasn't
29:27 really a park kind of guy you know I was
29:29 like even my motorcycle kind of my
29:31 weight but that day we drove into the
29:33 city we went to this park it's this
29:36 peaceful thing that's going on and
29:37 people just shown out and I think there
29:39 was some event that later that evening
29:41 or something but all these Hells Angels
29:43 start to show up and there was a bunch
29:46 of parking problems because of some
29:48 event that was happening I don't think
29:49 we were trying to stay for the event I
29:51 don't think we even knew the event was
29:52 going to occur if I remember right but
29:55 my mom looked around and saw all this
29:57 kind of compression of people and said
30:00 let's get out of here and no sooner did
30:03 we get out of that place and a full-on
30:06 brutal brawl happened between the
30:10 citizens who were there fighting these
30:12 bikers and then the Kansas Highway
30:15 Patrol showed up showed up and if you've
30:18 never seen a Kansas Highway patrolman
30:19 which I I'm pretty sure it was the
30:21 Highway Patrol even though it was City
30:22 District they are next to Marines okay
30:26 if you get pulled over by a Kansas City
30:28 Highway Patrol guy you'll know what I'm
30:30 talking about these dudes are some of
30:32 the most tightest trip tightest dressed
30:34 police officers in this country and they
30:38 well at least it used to be that way
30:40 when I was a kid maybe they all weighed
30:41 400 pounds now but I haven't seen that I
30:43 give that example just to kind of set
30:45 that aside those things can kind of just
30:47 be logic problems of going yes doesn't
30:49 look right but I'm willing to bet if
30:51 you're 30 years old you've had at least
30:53 one moment where it almost felt like a
30:55 voice was talking to you
30:58 giving you good advice either way get
31:01 involved get out it suggests this
31:05 carrier wave of information in this new
31:09 awakening that's happening online I
31:12 would say due to being online okay a lot
31:16 of us can feel it we can feel the fact
31:18 that that subject matters are coming up
31:20 then two sides of the globe before the
31:23 two sides have a chance to observe each
31:25 other and then what we do is we end up
31:27 observing each other and finding out the
31:29 historical record that that two weeks
31:32 ago a month ago a year ago a bunch of us
31:35 got on the same track for whatever
31:37 reason and the interesting thing is we
31:39 get on these tracks without any real
31:41 help now we know that there's
31:43 disinformation campaigns out there that
31:45 get us off on crazy things
31:47 I won't demonize any one theory but you
31:49 know there's plenty of them out there
31:52 right but given how much is still
31:55 coveted and hidden how much the press
31:59 doesn't report on things that they
32:02 should be reporting on there's a lot of
32:05 hype mining going on way outside the
32:07 fabric of anything being input from
32:10 YouTube or fringy websites right but
32:15 let's look at the fundamental principles
32:17 of this little furnace and the inside of
32:20 perhaps all atoms and therefore inside
32:27 biomatter that can use it for something
32:30 other than just sheer existence because
32:32 what I've said is sort of a paradox
32:34 right I've told you that there's this
32:37 bio photon theory that we give off light
32:41 that's one set of experiments there's
32:43 another theory that talks about it
32:45 giving healing energy I just watched the
32:48 documentary on Netflix where a guy
32:50 didn't eat for like 55 days and just
32:52 drank water and he didn't it didn't die
32:54 he was fine you went through a lot of
32:56 pain and he said the world record was 50
33:00 some days and he tried to break the
33:02 world record in his little adventure you
33:07 know he didn't contact unis Book of
33:10 World Records or anything but
33:12 there are videos online of gurus in
33:14 India who claim to have not eaten for
33:17 over I think the guys up to three
33:20 decades now and he says he just eats
33:23 from the Sun no one's there to verify
33:27 this but the dude I saw you could almost
33:32 believe it but he isn't he isn't
33:34 completely emaciated or anything he's
33:36 not a walking skeleton he does have to
33:38 drink water of course but who wants to
33:41 try that theory out now me right so what
33:46 gives if if this guy from crow castles
33:49 correct right which i think if you were
33:52 to say photons are stored within
33:54 biomatter be very difficult to denied
33:57 that exact principle from matter that
34:00 isn't considered organic like the table
34:03 like this camera right let me give you
34:07 an analogy of how you might think about
34:09 this how many of you have been using a
34:14 remote control at your house for four or
34:17 five years and for whatever reason the
34:19 battery doesn't go dead
34:20 maybe a couple of years most Logitech
34:24 mice can go for two and a half three
34:26 years without having your place either
34:28 two doublea's or a single triple-a
34:31 depending on how it works right so you
34:33 go fishing around in one of your drawers
34:35 in the kitchen in your little pantry and
34:40 you find a battery that you bought god
34:42 knows when it's still in the package and
34:44 there's 20 other ones in the package
34:47 you're not sure if it works you pull out
34:51 the old batteries and toss them put
34:53 these two new batteries in quote unquote
34:55 new and I'll be damned it works small
35:00 footnote naive old batteries seem to run
35:02 themselves down without being used it's
35:04 really a bummer I don't know why it is
35:06 you can't even trust buying them from
35:09 the store but you have this power cell
35:12 that's sitting on a shelf doing nothing
35:14 it's a it's a chemical reaction that's
35:17 inside this thing but you put it in MO
35:19 control and all the sudden something
35:21 starts happening the energy is drawn out
35:23 of this battery and it is put to use
35:26 in a circuit and circuits creating an RF
35:28 wave to the television to control it in
35:32 a way you gave the battery life but the
35:38 battery already existed with its power
35:40 supply inside but something better is
35:42 going on when you were a little kid in
35:45 the 70s and 80s you know we had toys
35:47 that ran on D cell batteries big-ass
35:50 diesel batteries for those of you had
35:52 big boom boxes back in the day you know
35:55 that those D batteries real important
35:57 you gave life to a radio the Machine
36:02 that is the human body is the remote
36:05 control in my opinion the food that we
36:09 ingest gets metabolized and broken down
36:13 into what energy calorie energy that's
36:20 why processed food is horrible for you
36:21 it barely has any energy in it oh sure
36:24 it'll convince your stomach you're full
36:26 and you go to bed but you didn't get any
36:28 nutrients out of it if you were to
36:31 sustain yourself on fast food we all
36:34 know what happens right I think I told
36:36 you that the the story of the gentleman
36:39 at my work who tried to give blood he
36:43 goes into convulsions inside the bus out
36:46 in front of our company while I'm
36:47 standing there waiting to give blood my
36:49 girlfriend's in front of me she's
36:50 freaking out he is six foot three
36:53 gigantic guy just absolutely in a
36:57 seizure on the bed we went back into his
37:01 cube what was the ingesting as his
37:03 primary food a cup of noodle and
37:06 Mountain Dew drink the guy disappeared
37:10 for I think around a month came back all
37:14 that crap was gone out of his cube and
37:16 it was all vegetables meats and I forgot
37:21 what he was drinking probably water or
37:24 iced tea or something but he needed he
37:26 had drained his body of what he needed
37:29 to sustain life and when he gave blood
37:31 he went over the edge
37:33 he depleted his body of the bare minimum
37:36 he had managed to scrape off of whatever
37:39 was keeping
37:39 life right luckily the dude didn't die
37:43 human beings as you well know being one
37:47 yourself were an amazing creation we
37:52 heard an amazing design aren't we I was
37:56 thinking about it last night because you
37:58 know people misunderstand this you know
38:04 we give we give credit to a lot of
38:05 animals animals are not dumb beings
38:07 they're living beings and I believe they
38:09 have souls of their own although some
38:12 religions can't handle that idea but the
38:15 brain of a dolphin is bigger than the
38:17 brain of a human being in totality but
38:20 the part that's bigger is all their
38:22 cerebellum stuff where they're all their
38:25 muscle memory is because they have to
38:27 swim or die right because they have to
38:29 come up to the surface and take air you
38:31 have to swim constantly same thing with
38:34 what is it a shark has to constantly
38:36 swim otherwise sinks to the bottom now a
38:38 shark can continue breathing the gill
38:40 filtered water but the dolphin has to
38:43 get here so does the whale see even
38:46 though their brains are bigger the
38:47 frontal lobes and all the parts that
38:49 make man different are smaller than ours
38:53 now
38:56 let's think about the stuff that we
38:59 talked about on this particular show I
39:01 mean we talked about some crazy stuff
39:03 right and the comment sections even more
39:06 so think about any animal that you can
39:10 name and think about it contemplating
39:13 what we contemplate think about a squid
39:16 it's pretty damn ingenious right barely
39:18 has any tissue that it claims to be a
39:20 brain is it writing screenplays is it
39:25 writing the next episode of Orwell is it
39:29 coming up with some invention that
39:31 theoretically could take us to the stars
39:34 probably not right so the the grand
39:40 design of human which is not perfect it
39:44 is perfect and perhaps that it holds
39:48 consciousness and gives a soul sort of
39:52 an in
39:53 finit number of variations that we call
39:55 life right if you kept coming back as a
39:58 human being you could have unbelievable
40:02 lifes as long as the earth keeps
40:03 changing and society keeps changing
40:05 there's probably not a possibility that
40:08 you could ever repeat what you did
40:10 before you could never look the same
40:12 you just couldn't even if you keep
40:14 pushing kept pushing yourself into the
40:16 bloodline that you came from trying to
40:18 hope and pray that somehow you're
40:20 recreated all the genes stack up
40:23 correctly once again as you contemplate
40:25 who we are usually the first experience
40:29 you get is this amazing alienation this
40:32 amazing isolation oh my god I know that
40:36 I exist I think therefore I am let's
40:39 just say but what the hell is that
40:43 there's no answers when you first
40:45 contemplate that because you don't have
40:48 an over laying ecosystem to explain what
40:52 you are and science doesn't help
40:55 religion doesn't help right
40:58 think about why religions are spread
41:00 into countries there's only a few that
41:04 are fanatical and there's plenty of
41:06 flavors in the United States of America
41:07 let me tell you before you have to reach
41:09 out to any foreign country but you take
41:12 a country that is brand-new it's been
41:14 discovered they don't really have much
41:16 every religion but they're actually
41:17 happy and a foreign country wants to
41:20 control that country they know if you
41:23 can indoctrinate those people to believe
41:25 a particular religion especially fear
41:29 for their souls eternity and they have
41:31 to go through band to get you know
41:33 flawed pedophilia men to go to get your
41:37 salvation to God isn't that unbelievable
41:39 right but you can control them you can
41:45 guilt trip them you can mold them but if
41:50 you never inject those paradigms into
41:52 men the only other thing you got left is
41:55 science quote unquote science right a
41:59 separate religion that starts to break
42:03 you down and make you feel insignificant
42:06 as Douglas Adams wrote in his book The
42:08 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy when
42:10 one goes into the total perspective
42:11 vortex a machine that punishes you by
42:13 showing you how insignificant you are in
42:15 the universe you see that you're an
42:17 infinitely small dot on an infinitely
42:19 small dot infinitely small how ingenious
42:25 was that guy to say just knowing how
42:28 insignificant you are on the universe is
42:30 the greatest punishment you could ever
42:32 endure as a human being and only Zaphod
42:34 Beeblebrox was able to go through it
42:36 then again he was in a false universe
42:38 and Johnny woods office right this
42:41 biophoton theory if you mix the two
42:44 together the biophotonic photographs are
42:48 merely the physical proof that this is
42:52 what's occurring but the biophotonics
42:56 science that says perhaps that is the
42:59 ecosystem that keeps us healthy that's
43:02 the next stage up and I would suggest in
43:05 this episode as many have suggested
43:09 before me it represents the bloodline of
43:13 the universe one could think of it as
43:17 red blood cells that move around
43:19 although that's a rather slow medium or
43:22 one could think of it as the conceivably
43:26 infinitely quick electrical nervous
43:29 system of the universe what isn't clear
43:32 about the universe is whether or not
43:34 there are true delays in all mediums
43:39 that comprise the universe again this is
43:42 all theoretical in terms of what we
43:44 theorize the universe to be made out of
43:46 right but the one thing that man and and
43:50 again physics has polluted this horribly
43:52 Eric dollar has shined a lot of pardon
43:56 the pun a lot of light on this is that
43:59 the photon light is the fastest moving
44:02 thing that we have identified as man now
44:06 there's a lot of false claims that light
44:08 travels at a single speed all the
44:11 universities of the world that have
44:13 measured Lights have found varying
44:15 actually pretty pretty decent variations
44:18 in the speed of light and we think that
44:20 if there
44:20 any particle that goes faster history
44:22 light we simply can't track it save
44:26 ether which again Tesla and Faraday both
44:29 tracked it 50 times the speed of light
44:31 Eric dollar confirmed that at 11 years
44:33 old in the military lab of RC and the
44:36 Navy but Eric Dollard in his retro
44:41 research reading books from you know
44:45 hundred years ago some eyes at the end
44:48 of his journey and he's still on his
44:49 journey that the Starlight doesn't take
44:53 any time to get to us this notion that
44:57 things are really far away and that
44:58 we're seeing the past is all bs
45:00 according to his research and let me
45:04 tell you this guy understands books that
45:08 most of us would utterly struggle to
45:10 complete a page with full understanding
45:12 for those who engage in the art of
45:17 remote viewing the claim is that there
45:22 is no delay in time looking into the
45:25 universe anywhere you want to look again
45:28 I'm still way on the sidelines of remote
45:31 viewing I just haven't seen enough proof
45:34 that it works I haven't met anyone who's
45:36 actually claimed to have done it I
45:38 certainly haven't seen an experiment in
45:39 front of my face but when you think
45:42 about consciousness it is amazing how we
45:48 illustrate consciousness in our brain
45:51 now what's going to create a separate
45:53 episode on dreams but I'm gonna throw it
45:57 in here because I think it matters and I
45:59 don't think I can do a whole hour on
46:01 this idea but I want you to contemplate
46:03 this for a second here's your bonus
46:06 inside this episode okay it is
46:09 interesting how we are we are so sure of
46:11 things okay for you a theists hopefully
46:17 your ears perk up a little bit if you're
46:19 still there it dawned on me the other
46:22 day because I study dreams like a maniac
46:25 okay
46:26 it just daydreams just daydreams and
46:30 you're thinking about things in your
46:31 head if I said get a piece
46:34 paper album get your favorite writing
46:36 utensil whether that be a pencil or a
46:38 pin and I want you to get yourself in a
46:43 dark room with the spotlight on the
46:45 table so you can see what you're doing
46:46 but you have no other sensory input
46:47 going on and I want you to draw
46:51 something that you might dream about on
46:54 that piece of paper and I want you to
46:56 get everything right when I say right I
47:00 mean not only the architectural issues
47:04 going on I want to get you to draw all
47:07 the biological members of your dream
47:09 whether they be pets or insects or
47:11 humans get all their Anatomy correct and
47:15 then to top it off I want you to track
47:19 all the light sources in your dream if
47:22 it's a sunny day but that in your head
47:24 and account for that in your drawing
47:26 that there's a lamp any light coming
47:29 from anywhere I want you to raytrace
47:34 meaning you are to track every single
47:36 photon in your brain and transcribe that
47:40 onto the piece of paper a thousand
47:42 percent accurate and what's the
47:45 experiment here we're doing well when I
47:48 dream I don't know about you but I get
47:52 it right in my dream every single time
47:54 if I so much as daydream I can daydream
47:58 a living room and anything you want me
48:01 to put in there pink elephant 20 grey
48:06 aliens playing poker I can see it in my
48:09 head really quickly to the degree I need
48:13 to zoom in on something or let's say
48:15 we're role-playing and you say okay what
48:17 is what does the alien look like and I
48:19 say well which part of it do you want me
48:21 to describe give me the eye socket
48:23 what's that look like immediately my
48:26 brain is going to make decisions about
48:28 what that eyeball looks like it's an
48:30 almond black eye I have to decide how
48:32 much moisture test does that have an
48:34 eyelid if it doesn't have an eyelid as
48:37 they are getting dusty what's it made
48:39 out of does it reflect is the deepest
48:42 black in the world so looking into
48:44 another dimension but just the most
48:47 average thing
48:48 you dream about when you dream your
48:51 brain is getting godlike things perfect
48:56 but aren't you just a human being right
49:00 if you have all this empirical knowledge
49:02 about how light works and how
49:04 architecture works and people work how
49:07 are you able to imagine riding an
49:10 escalator down we're up and some of you
49:15 might try to poopoo this idea and say
49:17 yeah dude well we've seen all this stuff
49:19 in the real world I think some of you
49:22 know right away that you dream things
49:23 you've never seen before I've never seen
49:25 King Kong chase me down a neighborhood
49:27 but I had that dream at nine years old
49:29 was a neighborhood just like this it was
49:32 in Derby Kansas as a kid and I had this
49:34 probably 25 foot King Kong chasing me
49:38 because I just seen a movie on TV and
49:40 King Kong's way bigger than that in the
49:42 movie but he was destroying houses and
49:45 he he wasn't necessarily coming after me
49:47 but I was stuck you know with the
49:50 fencing around the houses and he was
49:52 just tearing up houses throwing
49:54 telephone poles just bashing in rooftops
49:57 I was 9 I had nine years of life at that
50:03 point if you just want to take a
50:04 clinical atheist scientific view of the
50:06 development of a brain and I was Envy I
50:09 was envisioning things I'd never seen
50:11 before I never seen a house get torn
50:12 apart I don't even think I've seen that
50:15 in a movie at that point I had no time
50:18 no problem dreaming it when I was four
50:19 years old I would dream of all the toys
50:22 in my room coming at me on the ground
50:25 Mike I was dark and they were all just
50:28 kind of marching towards me
50:30 I hadn't seen Close Encounters yet
50:32 either so how's that possible how is it
50:37 possible that we have access to create
50:39 at a seconds notice a fantasy a vision I
50:45 think it's because we are absolutely a
50:50 hundred percent homogeneous with the
50:52 universe itself not just its mass okay
50:57 we have carrier waves
51:00 travel this universe seemingly at
51:04 inexhaustible speeds now again we've
51:08 said on this show and the episode
51:10 especially does space exist that we
51:13 don't dream of being in space couple
51:18 people said they have but there is a
51:21 question can you dream about things
51:22 you've never seen before I haven't
51:24 personally dreamed of being in Asia even
51:28 though I was born in Europe mm-hmm I
51:30 can't say I've dreamed of you know a
51:33 Tudor neighborhood
51:34 I haven't dreamed of the Eiffel Tower or
51:37 Big Ben I've seen them in real life
51:41 but I I don't dream of them for some
51:44 reason it could be a localized frequency
51:47 right I dream the average beam frequency
51:51 that is going through the human bodies
51:53 that are in my area right for those that
51:56 you are politically minded most of you
51:59 have had a friend move from say a
52:02 conservative area to a quote unquote
52:05 more liberal area and it just takes
52:08 about a decade before that person starts
52:10 to become like the people that are up
52:11 there very liberal the reverse happens
52:16 big city people move to the Midwest all
52:18 the time they start to enjoy the simpler
52:22 life slower pace all their value systems
52:26 switch to the value systems of those of
52:29 which are there but there are some
52:31 people that move in these drastic
52:34 changes and they can't get out the
52:37 visions in their mind of where they're
52:39 from that they don't like where they are
52:41 now which is in one of the opposite
52:43 polarities of where they grew up and
52:46 it's their power to envision and
52:48 remember what it was like that keeps
52:51 them against wherever they are right so
52:55 what does this all come down to what is
52:57 the summation at the end of this episode
52:59 I want to throw this very simple idea at
53:02 you which a lot of you probably already
53:04 conceived of which is the following
53:07 what if photons our life
53:12 what if a photon is more than just some
53:16 light-emitting verb what if it is
53:21 actually staring at pure consciousness
53:23 like I said in episode not too long ago
53:26 we know that there's individuals that
53:28 call themselves the illuminated tons of
53:31 Sun worship when you start looking up
53:33 theories of light even in scientific
53:36 communities you will see the word
53:38 Luciferian now for those of you who are
53:41 religious you're starting to get
53:42 Beelzebub and and Satan views in your
53:46 mind I definitely have watched videos on
53:49 YouTube where someone is going on for an
53:52 hour plus trying to demonize the Sun as
53:56 the devil this bright thing that's
53:59 shining on me right now isn't that
54:01 interesting what's interesting about the
54:03 individuals that really get religious
54:05 about this kind of thing is that they'll
54:07 tell you you know not many people
54:10 demonize the Sun that I've ever seen but
54:12 they do call it Lucifer some groups call
54:15 it Lucifer okay its lumen ating it's
54:19 Luciferian I'm not quite sure where all
54:22 that comes together but they'll also
54:24 tell you that those that are evil will
54:26 invert symbolism what is good is bad and
54:30 what is bad is good why would they
54:33 suddenly straighten out their theory
54:35 with the Sun as they deem it to be some
54:38 demon istic thing and you believe it you
54:42 demonize the thing that you need the
54:44 most if you talk to the average soccer
54:47 mom there's plenty of soccer dads out
54:50 there too and you say well your kid
54:53 wants to play on the beach what should
54:54 your child bring man it's gonna be like
54:58 sunscreen 32 or 45 or whatever the
55:02 highest number you can get and they just
55:04 cream your kid and toxic chemicals and
55:08 then though the Sun hits it and
55:09 according to research at toxify boom if
55:12 you got some good old skin cancer on you
55:14 but if nothing else if nothing else
55:18 forget the toxification of the cream
55:20 don't totally forget it but put that
55:22 aside for just just a moment if you need
55:24 Sun
55:25 raise in order to stay healthy and you
55:28 constantly shower yourself in this stuff
55:30 at any time you get in the Sun you block
55:32 it you may not be the most healthy
55:36 individual now there are some cultures
55:38 that have shielded themselves for the
55:40 Sun from the Sun for thousands of years
55:43 but there's a difference between putting
55:46 a chemical barrier on your flesh and
55:48 literally blocking the sun's photons
55:51 from really doing what they do and
55:53 simply diverting it from direct skin
55:55 contact because you're your race
55:57 believes that being as white as a sheet
56:00 is is sexy you're still getting hit by
56:04 the photons right it's still Wiggles
56:06 through your fabrics and maybe it
56:08 doesn't give you a sunburn necessarily
56:10 because it doesn't have enough
56:11 concentration but you're still getting
56:12 the agitation that you need and perhaps
56:15 if we're right in this episode to any
56:17 degree about it being the carrier wave
56:19 of consciousness you get that to think
56:23 about the difference between working for
56:25 yourself and working in corporate
56:29 America incorporated anything corporate
56:32 Europe whatever what's the general
56:35 difference between working for our
56:37 company and working for yourself for
56:39 those of you work for yourself you might
56:41 know the answer right away for those of
56:42 you've always worked for corporation let
56:45 me get you hip to something here real
56:46 quick the average person who is
56:49 self-employed gets a lot more exposure
56:51 to the outdoors than folks that work for
56:54 corporations your construction worker
56:57 aren't they more burly people they stay
57:01 healthy and they can you know build a
57:04 house they can lift heavy objects they
57:07 just seem to stay healthy but when you
57:10 work for corporation you go inside a
57:12 building don't you completely shielded
57:15 from the Sun and he gets sick and you
57:19 might blame just the proximity of other
57:21 people that are sick and there's
57:22 probably a lot of truth to that but if
57:26 your immune system has to function to
57:27 keep you healthy then maybe getting a
57:30 little Sun as part of your diet that
57:32 you're missing there's all this talk
57:38 about you know and I've done episode on
57:41 the moon and the fact that there's a
57:44 very interesting anomaly that we have a
57:46 moon that went in the sky and in front
57:48 of the Sun it is the same size as the
57:52 Sun and if there's anything
57:55 astronomically against in this universe
57:57 that you could put your finger on this
57:59 as this is sort of so fantastic that you
58:04 can't believe it's true without absolute
58:07 intend by our designers it would be the
58:09 fact that our moon is too big to be
58:12 around our planet for one and that when
58:14 it blocks the Sun it creates an eclipse
58:16 because it is so absolutely the exact
58:19 freakin size of the Sun some people have
58:23 done the experiment where moonlight is
58:25 cooler it cools basically and the Sun
58:29 heats up and so there's a lot of
58:32 additional theories to the to the moon
58:34 now sometimes the moon's not out
58:36 sometimes the sun's out both at the same
58:38 time it's a black night the moon is
58:40 completely waned out of existence for a
58:43 particular night how many of you have
58:45 contemplated that the Sun could be God
58:49 and you look at the Stars and you're
58:52 like Aang come on man there's a bunch of
58:53 stars out there and I've seen in Star
58:54 Trek I mean Star Trek's real right and
58:56 all those other little specks out there
58:59 are Suns well right
59:03 we have a viewer Dave that films stars
59:06 with his camera it's super zoom 600 zoom
59:10 camera I think right and boy these
59:12 things sure look different out there
59:14 than our Sun they seem to rotate they
59:18 seem to have a center a nucleus for
59:22 those of you who study martial arts
59:24 either kung foo which is usually the I
59:28 think the pinnacle example of this this
59:30 was that the shall shall we shall young
59:34 monks singing that wrong but Shaolin
59:39 monks they have this these procedures
59:42 that they use before they do moves where
59:46 they swoop their arms through the air
59:49 and they
59:51 so their arms and they draw it towards
59:52 their chest in most cases and when I saw
59:56 this as a young kid I thought man what
59:57 is this is this some weird dance they're
59:59 doing is it some coordination primer or
60:01 something like that I'm sure it has all
60:03 the effects of that but when you ask
60:06 them they say no we are gathering Chi
60:09 within our body since we have this
60:12 temporary archive of energy storage like
60:16 a battery and so that when we fight we
60:18 actually move the cheat out through our
60:20 hands through our feet through our body
60:22 and when we strike it's more powerful
60:25 than if we hadn't done this you might
60:27 try this experiment if you're well
60:30 whether or not you're into meditation or
60:31 not I do this from time to time and
60:34 it'll give me shivers it's crazy if you
60:37 sit down and you again stop thinking of
60:41 yourself as the human body think of
60:43 yourself as the soul that sent his
60:44 vessel and from the top of your head
60:47 just envision almost like a Van Allen
60:50 belt you just envision the energy and an
60:54 information and consciousness of the
60:56 universe just siphoning and filtering
60:59 into your head and going all the way
61:01 through your glands right all the glands
61:03 down your spine right
61:04 go see shock rub Maps if you need to
61:07 know where these things are and then
61:09 it'll pretty much exit out the bottom of
61:11 your body you do that for I would say it
61:15 takes me less than five seconds to do it
61:17 before I will get this shiver and it's a
61:21 euphoric shiver or any of you've
61:23 climaxed in your life it's the little
61:25 tremble after the climax it's the same
61:27 exact feeling at will you can do this
61:31 you could be sitting at work with
61:33 headset on listening to this podcast and
61:36 you just do that and just just see to
61:38 the degree you should actually
61:39 physically feel it it'll start tingling
61:42 in your system a little bit and you'll
61:43 feel it go through your system and it's
61:46 very interesting that I don't have this
61:47 if I don't concentrate on it as if I you
61:51 know you have to draw it into your
61:54 system now for those who are religious
61:55 they might say it's the Holy Spirit or
61:57 something it might be the same thing
62:01 pure true
62:03 of consciousness to ingest the
62:05 mathematical algorithms and realities
62:07 out of this universe into your body you
62:09 are ingesting truth trust me you can't
62:14 ingest anything out of the universe but
62:15 truth because that's what it's made out
62:17 of now before I close so what those a
62:21 reminder out there when I did an episode
62:24 on electrical universe might be an
62:27 interesting episode to listen to after
62:28 this because I wasn't hip to this con
62:31 this concept when I made that episode
62:33 but when I talk about the fact that the
62:36 Sun has a plasma core so does the earth
62:39 so does the moon so does every celestial
62:41 body that we have discovered okay that's
62:45 an energy core
62:46 SuperDuper concentrated energy core the
62:49 plasma energy is again your stem cell
62:52 energy in the universe it hasn't decided
62:53 what it's going to be because it hasn't
62:55 slowed down enough to get a designation
62:57 by man to be a hydrogen atom helium atom
63:01 carbon atom light itself a photon if you
63:07 can see plasma energy it's because the
63:08 venire of the plasma has has transposed
63:12 into a thermalized photonic shell but a
63:17 lot of times when we see plasma energy
63:18 it looks like a mirror because it is
63:21 reflecting everything off of it because
63:23 it's like uh-uh you can't come in here
63:25 because you've decided what to be I
63:27 haven't you can't commingle plasma and
63:29 normal energy truly in the same place as
63:32 I understand it for any viewer that's
63:35 ever seen ball lightning it's said to be
63:39 nothing more than a little bit of plasma
63:41 energy either being created in an
63:43 electrical storm or freed from the
63:45 bowels of the earth through cracks and
63:46 the rocks which is why you see ball
63:48 lightning in deserts shoot up out of the
63:52 ground and go up into the sky
63:55 that's all right what's why I believe we
63:57 see a series of lights in the desert
64:00 sometimes so just keep all that in mind
64:03 start to think of the universe perhaps
64:07 as a beautiful homogeneous energy that
64:11 is simply flowing through absolutely
64:13 everything
64:14 we are something incredibly fortunate
64:17 that we somehow have consciousness
64:20 within all this inanimate mass and again
64:24 dreams are not these cutouts of things
64:27 that you've seen right if dreams are
64:30 merely a bunch of composited cutouts of
64:33 things that you'd seen in your life one
64:34 you'd never be able to dream of anything
64:35 you hadn't seen and two it wouldn't look
64:39 right right the light casting on the
64:40 dashboard of your Lamborghini in your
64:42 dream would be different than the light
64:44 casting on the street from the light
64:46 pole because that's got a different
64:48 light source that you saw a long time
64:49 ago and this one has a different one but
64:51 it's not that way is it it's perfect as
64:54 delusional as it might be as renewing as
64:57 it might be from ii ii ii ii that you
65:00 see are photo real in most cases if you
65:04 dream like i do which i think you do if
65:07 you haven't gone to deep thoughts
