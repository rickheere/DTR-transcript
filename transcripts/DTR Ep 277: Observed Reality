00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this beautiful breezy
00:41 spring summer afternoon here in Southern
00:43 California
00:45 officially the temperature is about 69
00:48 but in the Sun it's about 73 5 so it's
00:51 kind of nice this concludes your weather
00:54 update so today I'm going to talk about
00:58 something rather I guess I could say
01:01 esoteric a little out of the norm but
01:06 it's something that's happened to me
01:10 after I've detoxed out of probably at
01:14 least two substances lunding fluoride to
01:19 the best of my ability and because you
01:22 know I drink tea at restaurants and [ __ ]
01:24 so you still get a little bit of it but
01:25 I'll brush with it getting out of
01:29 aspartame eating more GMO free stuff
01:32 that's not horrible and I think doing
01:35 this show thinking more you know the way
01:38 that you make your brain bigger is to
01:40 think that's how synapse decide to
01:42 procreate it's all based on the
01:44 electrical use of the synapse that you
01:46 have and so if you think a lot think a
01:48 lot think a lot they get exacerbated to
01:51 the point with like I shouldn't be on
01:52 this much eject a little piece of the
01:56 nuclei out into the brain cavity the
01:58 neurons the neural connections attached
02:02 to it to protect it and you get a little
02:05 extra circuit
02:06 little extra transistor in your brain
02:10 and I said a couple times on the show
02:13 and remind you guys that the big deal is
02:16 that you start to think better and you
02:23 start to think better so much that it's
02:25 disturbing at first now at least for me
02:29 it was it was like I felt like I was
02:33 sort of at the peak of being able to
02:34 kind of consciously digest which
02:36 actually brings into question sort of
02:38 the difference between the image in your
02:41 brain of how much data you have
02:44 retrieved from long-term storage or
02:46 taken in from your five senses at any
02:48 one moment when you paint the picture in
02:50 front of you and then you're having to
02:52 almost as your sole deal with the
02:55 picture
02:58 it's a very interesting thing it's kind
03:00 of how I feel about it's like I'm like I
03:03 have two levels of what builds
03:05 consciousness for me information and the
03:07 ability to process it
03:09 I have never had until i detoxed more
03:13 processor power then I could
03:16 overwhelming amount of processor power
03:18 versus the amount of information I was
03:20 taking in when that became extremely
03:23 imbalanced and I would say again it hit
03:27 me one day driving somewhere here and I
03:29 left my house and I was hitting an
03:30 intersection on the other side of my
03:33 block and I remember just looking around
03:37 and my brain was on [ __ ] fire
03:42 absolutely it's just it had taken all of
03:46 reality and eaten it in like a
03:48 nanosecond and needed you know more and
03:53 I'll tell you that the substance I was
03:55 ingesting the most because I didn't
03:56 ingest a lot of fluoride right you brush
03:59 your teeth quite twice a day or whatever
04:01 and then we drink you know water
04:03 I don't drink tap water never really
04:06 have so that wasn't a real source for me
04:08 other than restaurants right that makes
04:11 it with sodas and mix it with tea and
04:13 that kinda stuff but the thing I
04:15 probably detox that of the most was
04:17 aspartame fake sugars all of them I got
04:23 rid of my microwave and luckily I had a
04:28 partner that understood she was like
04:31 yeah I've been trying to get you to go
04:33 healthy for a long time I didn't know
04:35 anything about this weird stuff you're
04:37 telling me but I'm willing to do it
04:38 because I wake we should go more natural
04:40 and I'm like yeah yeah yeah another one
04:42 of us are like crunchy hippies or
04:44 anything my hair was short at the time
04:46 but it's been 13 years since I did that
04:50 2005 now its 2018 and I could tell you
04:56 over the last year I've had some
05:01 advancement of my understanding of how
05:03 my own brain works and I want to share
05:05 it with you just in case you have this
05:07 because it might make you a lot more
05:08 powerful and I'm calling it observed
05:12 consciousness and I'm gonna try to get
05:14 the definition out as quickly as
05:16 possible so that we can start talking
05:17 about it I have no idea I'm gonna talk
05:20 about this for an hour we'll see with
05:23 this extra processor power what I've
05:24 been able to do in my own brain is is
05:28 sort of get a a physical separation of
05:34 my various processes in my brain but
05:38 what does that mean well you know I got
05:42 a computer in front of me it's recording
05:44 this conversation got the camera over
05:45 there and this is all creating a
05:49 consciousness for you so that when you
05:51 listen to it back all this marries
05:53 together got the microphone running down
05:55 here I'm a little mixing box right there
05:56 power supplies make sure I don't run out
05:58 power got the Sun lighting it up for
06:02 those of you watching and so we're
06:04 creating I'm gathering and creating a
06:06 reality here so that you can have it
06:09 then I take it in the back room and
06:10 edited so as a physical location thing
06:13 going on when you're in real life but I
06:17 think one of the biggest misconceptions
06:18 that I had for myself was that I always
06:21 thought I was one thing it's just me
06:24 right here I still have all my limbs but
06:28 we know that people lose limbs they lose
06:30 fingers and digits and more horrific
06:32 situations they lose an arm and a leg or
06:35 something if they don't pass out after
06:39 that process there has to be this moment
06:41 of Epiphany when you look at your finger
06:44 over there and you're over here and that
06:46 thing has been with you your entire life
06:49 and yes you know every cell in your body
06:51 dies and renews within seven years they
06:54 say so perhaps you've known that thumb
06:56 or that whatever for seven years but
06:59 it's nervous system it's touch it's
07:03 sense has always been with you and now
07:06 it's going to start to disappear your
07:08 might as your brain remaps that reason
07:10 to something else
07:13 well that's an easier one to wrap your
07:16 mind around because it's physical you
07:19 have other physical pieces of proof that
07:22 when you demo something you destroy a
07:25 table because you're gonna throw it away
07:27 or cut a box apart cuz it won't fit in
07:29 the trashcan you know you're cutting it
07:31 to pieces the tomato that you cut into
07:33 pieces and hey you cut it into six
07:35 pieces sixty-six different people in the
07:37 room can enjoy the taste of a single
07:39 thing interesting but now when I say how
07:43 many pieces and parts exist for a
07:45 thought in your brain we don't ask that
07:49 question do we it's all one thing it's
07:52 like a stream of consciousness it's me
07:54 it's it and I have discovered that at
07:58 least in my mind it's a bunch of
08:02 different pieces my soul is sort of my
08:08 the deepest part of my consciousness it
08:13 being represented as a camera and so I
08:16 am looking at this world from like the
08:18 back of my head and even beyond the back
08:20 of where my skull is because that's sort
08:23 of whatever at whatever I am it's coming
08:25 in and watching yes it's it's coalescing
08:29 all the five senses to create another
08:31 image but there I am talking about
08:35 setting aside the fact that I can feel a
08:37 slightly cool wind on my body right now
08:39 I can feel stripes of heat on my flesh
08:42 right now I can taste this babalu cigar
08:48 but within my brain within my
08:52 consciousness I should say I have very
08:54 segregated things that feel I'm starting
08:57 to feel their physical difference what
09:00 does any brain made out of in the most
09:02 laymen layman's terms you have long term
09:06 memory and short term memory it's
09:09 usually discussed in a way that your
09:12 short term memory is what's on your mind
09:14 right now what are you thinking about
09:16 what just happened to you you kind of
09:19 have this little dish salt it's kind of
09:21 rolling constantly right long-term
09:23 memory is where you go back and you
09:25 think about those Christmas cookies that
09:26 your grandma used to make before she
09:27 passed away and isn't it a shame that no
09:30 one has that recipe anymore right
09:33 I used to whelp it this way every time
09:37 every ever since I saw those data
09:41 centers were robot arms go all over the
09:45 place and grab various storage units and
09:47 move them and put them into a play
09:49 mechanism I've always thought of my
09:51 long-term memory as some sort of system
09:54 like that except it obviously moves at
09:56 some Lightspeed thing
09:58 so to recap because I'm going to give
10:01 you the fourth one which i think is
10:02 where observed reality comes into play
10:06 here so my soul feels like a camera
10:09 looking at whatever I'm able to harvest
10:11 out of reality and again I'm really
10:14 talking about consciousness not the
10:16 physicality of everything right I feel
10:19 sort of like the TARDIS Doctor Who
10:21 basement with all my long-term memory in
10:24 there and to the degree I keep the the
10:28 mechanism of grabbing that memory really
10:31 fluent it works really quickly but if I
10:36 don't go back and get stuff on a routine
10:39 basis the yeah it's like it gets a
10:41 little rusty
10:41 it takes a little longer the next time
10:43 and then you have your consciousness the
10:48 short-term 10 minute loop that's in
10:49 there and you sort of have in that you
10:51 know the priority one things that you're
10:54 thinking about and there's you know it's
10:56 you know when you send an email whether
10:59 you guys have ever used the future
11:00 before there's like a priority list you
11:02 can actually sit small medium high or
11:03 whatever you know when you set it too
11:07 high the person odesite gets a big bread
11:08 explanation point it's kind of nice so
11:12 something exciting is happening or even
11:13 more poignant Lee something dangerous is
11:16 happening to you
11:17 oh that level of consciousness wipes out
11:19 everything else until that situation is
11:21 resolved and you can go back to your
11:22 normal sort of full spectrum process
11:27 right of thinking but the reason why I'm
11:30 making this episode is that over the
11:32 last year I have started to master a new
11:38 method of looking at information that in
11:41 the past I thought were my thoughts and
11:47 there's probably someone who's figured
11:51 this out and has a completely different
11:52 name for it please let me know in the
11:54 suggestions but I've never had anyone
11:57 parse consciousness to any major degree
12:02 besides a bunch of you know
12:05 exhibitionistic wordsmithing
12:07 from philosophers just trying to sound
12:10 smart right there's some irony and
12:13 essence wasn't there for me when I would
12:18 look at my consciousness throughout the
12:20 day in the past and I you know talked
12:23 about maybe 47 years of doing this I
12:26 thought that if something came into my
12:29 head it was mine it was my thought that
12:34 I was having and you know like I said in
12:40 a recent episode it's not out yet but I
12:42 did it didn't account for the fact that
12:46 when I wrote screenplays
12:48 that the characters lived by themselves
12:51 and it seemed like they lived outside by
12:53 consciousness and the idea was well
12:56 everything that's inside me isn't it
12:58 mine aren't I the one creating all the
13:02 thoughts that I'm having is it possible
13:04 for me to have a thought inside my
13:07 consciousness quote unquote physical
13:09 location noted right
13:11 that isn't mine don't we have this idea
13:15 that it's all ours but in the physical
13:18 world so as you step outside the
13:20 paradigm of consciousness and your own
13:22 brain well [ __ ] happens all the time
13:24 it's not me the jet just flew over I'm
13:27 not flying that thing and I'm not in it
13:28 and the car just drove by cuz it's a
13:30 nice day Huntington Beach everyone's
13:31 getting out there hot rods I'm not them
13:35 I'm not controlling the
13:37 the noise that their car is making in
13:40 their motorcycles making so in the
13:42 physical world you have all kinds of
13:44 things that occur to you and around you
13:46 that aren't you and you accepted every
13:48 single day but for some reason we think
13:52 that everything that's inside of our
13:54 head is 100% our property our cause I am
13:59 discovering that we observe
14:01 consciousness in large percentages that
14:06 we have thoughts that come through our
14:07 head that do use the players of our play
14:13 that you observe but it's not your
14:18 thought it is simply something that is
14:21 occurring to you and you're what looking
14:24 at it you don't own it it's not in your
14:27 memory banks of having occurred because
14:29 it's a speculative situation a thought
14:33 it's sort of like the philip k dick
14:35 extreme of consciousness the river of
14:37 consciousness that he talked about the
14:41 reason why i want to mention this is
14:42 because over the last year and i think
14:45 large part due to this show and just
14:47 talking to you guys and expanding the
14:49 mind and trying to find new episodes in
14:51 my head and it has probably allowed me
14:54 to discern things talking about dreams
14:56 as allowed me to parse reality better
14:59 you gain a lot of sovereign identity by
15:05 understanding that you can have
15:07 conscious thoughts or at least
15:10 observable images of consciousness go
15:13 through your head and you don't have to
15:16 own them as your character i give you an
15:20 example i think anyone who drives a
15:24 vehicle has had a minor road rage thing
15:30 inside your head you know I think 99.9%
15:33 of us never flipped the bird but just
15:37 something happens where someone's being
15:39 oblivious to the universe for being rude
15:42 specifically and you will envision
15:44 something or see something in your head
15:46 that is way beyond the capacity of your
15:49 character to an
15:50 something dark wishing someone harm does
15:56 I'm using a car thing because I could
15:58 say a random moment in time when someone
16:00 offends you or pisses you off right it
16:05 also happens for all the positive realms
16:07 too you see a pretty person and you have
16:10 all these visions of doing things with
16:11 them some of that might cross over into
16:15 your own ownership your own instigating
16:17 of the thought but now well let me
16:21 finish up this particular first take on
16:24 this if you believed you owned every
16:28 thought that every star every piece of
16:30 consciousness that ever came through
16:32 your mind's eye you might feel very
16:35 guilty about the kind of thoughts that
16:37 you can have you think that you're
16:40 seeing deeper into your own soul what
16:44 I'm going to suggest is especially after
16:46 practicing it for a good year as once
16:50 you realize it's not you that you're
16:53 merely looking into some telescope or
16:56 microscope into eventualities that I
17:00 guess technically could happen in some
17:02 cases probably a bunch of them can't
17:04 happen at all and when you realize
17:08 they're external to you you no longer
17:13 shape and mold your own self image based
17:16 on these random occurrences in your
17:18 consciousness for instance have you ever
17:22 had this statement in your mind or heard
17:24 someone tell you man I had these
17:26 thoughts and I can't stop them and
17:27 they're just dark and I just can't know
17:29 or you know it could be lustful thinking
17:34 towards someone's wife or husband and
17:36 they're married you like both of them
17:37 you would never do anything to hurt them
17:39 and so you have that like the Jessie's
17:42 girl song sort of thing right or again
17:46 someone pisses you off and the the
17:48 retaliation in your brain is so insane
17:51 that you just go oh my god do I have
17:53 this darkness in me there's a lot of
17:57 people who get tattoos to express their
18:01 inner darkness that they
18:04 feel like they have this marriage with
18:06 this dark side on the inside because
18:08 they are capable of seeing these things
18:10 they think oh that must be me it's
18:12 inside me so I'm gonna get big Skull and
18:15 Bones on the arm what if they're just
18:19 simply seeing what they allow themselves
18:22 to see and by misunderstanding they meld
18:28 it with their personality or they feared
18:31 that that's who they really are and
18:33 every day that they wake up and they see
18:35 more they observe these other levels of
18:40 consciousness these other storylines
18:43 you shouldn't say levels but storylines
18:45 they think that it's some beacon of who
18:49 they really are
18:50 right you know I just kind of said that
18:54 twice but what if you could go up to
18:58 that person to say it's not you all
19:02 you're doing is opening up your mind to
19:07 be able to see over there a scenario but
19:13 in the same way that you might go to a
19:16 bar to get a drink and there's a bar
19:19 brawl and all kinds of people get hurt
19:21 and whatever
19:23 you were there you saw it but when you
19:25 go home you think your lucky stars
19:27 you're not a person who would start a
19:28 fight you're not a person who would
19:30 bring a gun to a bar or whatever and you
19:33 feel better the next day because you
19:35 know it's external to who you are but if
19:39 you're at the bar and no brawl breaks
19:41 out but you have some guy he's drunk and
19:44 annoying and he's he offended you your
19:47 girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever and
19:49 you have those Brawley shooty thoughts
19:51 towards that person the next morning you
19:54 might wake up and go God what kind of
19:55 monster am I thinking that you drew it
20:00 from the bowels of your own identity
20:02 what I had been doing for the majority
20:04 of my life without really knowing it is
20:08 I have been owning every single observed
20:12 consciousness every single thought
20:14 that's ever gone through my head I I
20:17 immediately think
20:18 thought I should say that I owned it I
20:21 made it happen
20:22 and this somehow I need to reconcile the
20:26 fact that I must be this person and over
20:31 the last year what happens to me and I
20:35 will tell you this too it starts to slow
20:40 down the more that you shun it it's
20:44 uncontrollable seeing of things that you
20:46 don't you would never want to see in
20:48 your head it's almost as if there's a
20:51 bit of a game being played on our
20:53 consciousness and I'm gonna gonna take a
20:55 little diversion after I get done here
20:58 into maybe some sort of metaphor of
21:02 Satan I don't necessarily believe Satan
21:05 exists or anything like that but it's
21:08 gonna be interesting some mechanism
21:09 right but the more that these things
21:13 occur it took a while it took and I
21:16 still have to play with it a little bit
21:17 but you know something will pop in my
21:19 head and you know it's usually something
21:22 that's what I should say this it's
21:25 really noticeable once your thought is
21:28 sort of really deviant from what your
21:31 normal thoughts are it doesn't have to
21:33 be super dark doesn't have to be super
21:35 light it just as many things of if
21:39 you're almost overhearing a visual
21:41 conversation you're not hearing any
21:43 voices in your head but I think about
21:45 homeless people who have gone feral due
21:47 to a lack of nutrition and food and
21:49 attention you know they're hearing
21:51 voices they're talking and they're just
21:52 trying to survive you I've seen plenty
21:56 of little videos from mental
21:57 institutions where people think that
21:59 aliens are talking to them and it's
22:00 always I've always wanted to have the
22:04 ability to go into some you know study
22:08 with these individuals and treat them as
22:10 if they're not crazy and go what are you
22:12 hearing you're well fed now you're
22:14 protected what are you hearing tell me
22:16 and some people have done this I've seen
22:18 in one video and they simply couldn't
22:20 make any sense out of what the person
22:21 was saying but then it's like are we
22:25 deciphering hieroglyphs we just need to
22:27 figure out what how they're using
22:28 language differently interesting right
22:31 one of the other things before I go into
22:33 this evil methodology with this is that
22:40 we are physically taught our perception
22:43 of ourselves is usually taught as your
22:46 just this bag of chemicals you're all by
22:47 yourself if you were sitting over here
22:50 listening to me instead of watching this
22:51 through a youtube video you have your
22:55 own bag of chemicals over there I got my
22:56 bad chemicals over here and there's
22:58 nothing nothing trends trends
23:00 transmitting between the two of us right
23:02 you have your own thing and I can
23:04 instill ideas in you by using you know
23:07 audio to talk to you my facial
23:10 expressions whatever and you have yours
23:12 to me but we are never taught to think
23:15 of ourselves as a stream of
23:17 consciousness which is what I promote on
23:19 this show and we've proven it again with
23:24 the ten monkey experiment we proven that
23:26 we communicate without speaking we do we
23:30 know that when you put four heads
23:31 together four I think it's like 15-20
23:34 minutes those two people are linked
23:36 once you pull them apart no matter how
23:38 physically far apart you put them no
23:40 matter if you put them in radio
23:41 frequency proof rooms they can see what
23:43 the other person is seeing and it goes
23:45 away very quickly but they're connected
23:48 that experiment has done several times
23:51 right so this is why it's very important
23:54 when you build a paradigm in your brain
23:56 of reality you know you try to figure
23:59 out the pieces and parts and the rules
24:01 by which those parts interact with each
24:03 other you better be very careful because
24:06 if you don't you will lock yourself out
24:08 of what you are now I use terms on the
24:12 show like soul and you usually think of
24:15 some Christian paradigm or whatever
24:17 other religion acknowledges a spirit or
24:19 a soul I don't have another word for
24:24 your organized life force that is you
24:28 this consciousness that you can feel
24:31 right now this very second
24:35 in my brain now I have sort of a back to
24:39 front layers of consciousness that I
24:41 acknowledged and each one of them plays
24:43 a different role in the basement is all
24:45 my long-term memory but in front there's
24:48 the layers that I actively manipulate
24:50 the ones that are closer to me and then
24:52 the one out there is the movie theater
24:54 it's the drive-in theater where I'm
24:57 sitting there in my car with all the
24:59 amenities of Who I am but I'm out I'm
25:02 allowed to look out the windshield and
25:03 see something on the big screen maybe
25:06 even hear it I don't know I've never
25:10 heard voices before really sometimes you
25:16 can you can hear the intent of someone's
25:19 thoughts that's probably the closest
25:20 I've ever had
25:21 but now what's interesting is is when I
25:25 started making the change and I'm not
25:29 sure how it occurred to me that this was
25:32 not me
25:33 actually don't I do actually now that
25:35 you think about it live here on this
25:37 recording what was happening to me was
25:40 that I was involved in a business
25:43 situation with some pretty shady people
25:45 that I had suspected were shady but I
25:49 couldn't prove it but I was also
25:52 connected to a partner my founding
25:54 partner who was naive lives in wishful
25:58 thinking and so if I was to be a part of
26:02 the venture that I helped found he had
26:04 to exhaust these other resources that
26:07 were not on the up-and-up and you know
26:11 they may have even been self
26:13 delusionally unaware of their own lack
26:16 of integrity may not be evil people they
26:19 just don't even realize that they're not
26:20 really helping much so it was very
26:24 frustrating from time to time throughout
26:26 the week I was having you know all this
26:28 sort of these guttural feelings you know
26:33 you know they say trust your gut my gut
26:36 was saying you're in a bad situation
26:38 these aren't good people they play every
26:42 once in a while like they'll they'll
26:43 push you to the limit and then they'll
26:45 be nice and they'll push you to limit
26:46 and be nice and there's this process the
26:48 people who
26:49 you do and they know the beat they're
26:51 masters at it it's really sick right and
26:54 so I would have these angry thoughts to
26:58 them towards them but what I was really
27:01 trying to do is get resolved and
27:02 essentially say it's from me I'm a
27:04 pragmatic guy on these levels and I'm
27:06 like okay either you've got to learn to
27:08 accept these individuals or the way that
27:13 they behave or you need to just simply
27:15 cut yourself loose and get out and go
27:18 find people that are more integral and
27:21 honest with reality so that least you
27:24 can accomplish something in this life
27:26 because you don't get these years back
27:27 dude and so for me the chatter of hatred
27:33 or the chatter of anger I would have
27:35 towards these individuals was a waste of
27:37 my time
27:38 it was the most definitive moment of
27:40 like wow now I'm sitting here just
27:42 boiling for no reason I don't you know I
27:44 don't have any value to that because
27:48 it's easy for me to say I'm extremely
27:50 talented I will always create something
27:52 new people who steal and people who copy
27:54 yeah whatever they get that one thing
27:56 and then they're screwed because they're
27:58 out because they don't make anything new
27:59 I'll go create new things I could change
28:02 industries if I want to so I started to
28:06 consciously say I don't want these
28:10 thoughts these thoughts are not
28:12 logically what I create as a person
28:15 because I don't have any vested interest
28:17 in this and there's no value to me and
28:19 so in that process I started I guess you
28:24 could say climbing back over the fence
28:26 of the paradigm in which I thought these
28:27 were my thoughts at first it sounds like
28:32 your mind [ __ ] yourself now you're
28:35 just bullshitting yourself and that's
28:36 how you created this little paradigm in
28:37 your brain it's the new one you're
28:39 talking about today
28:41 well I will say that my level of control
28:45 over this process is reaching 90% the
28:49 first thing that happened when I started
28:51 to reject this whole mechanism of
28:54 wasting my time with thoughts that are
28:56 not productive was that I physically
29:01 could see them over there and I'm over
29:03 when I look at my whole life you know I
29:06 have never consciously I'll tell you
29:08 this much I have never consciously
29:10 stepped on someone's head to get ahead
29:12 ever in my life ever plenty of people
29:16 have stepped on me not a ton but enough
29:19 and I just will not meet my maker with
29:24 that habit I just won't do it
29:26 but then something started to happen
29:29 slowly because well and I pulled out of
29:30 that situation
29:32 I found a new home where I could
29:35 continue that research and continue my
29:38 productivity and live in an absolutely
29:40 positive bright world with people who
29:42 are brilliant human beings who have 10
29:47 20 years experience in the stuff that
29:49 I'm dealing with now and so I have
29:51 mentors now I've just got really good
29:54 people around me and so but it was a
29:58 tough it was a tough transition it's
29:59 always tough to pull out of something
30:01 that you founded with this notion that
30:04 someone is going to perhaps try to take
30:08 your ideas and profit from them when
30:10 they had nothing to do with it in the
30:11 first place right
30:12 the losers trying to be winners
30:16 through theft as funny as these these
30:21 folks are interesting they they
30:23 rationalize what they do they
30:26 rationalize their theft it's really
30:28 strange now in this particular case
30:32 nothing is going to be stolen so it's
30:34 fine but I'm going to try to put this in
30:37 an analogy because it's I'm still
30:40 sorting out exactly how it felt and how
30:43 it feels but I want to kind of open up
30:45 your consciousness mm-hmm consciousness
30:48 to this other thought which is if you
30:53 don't know that there is a actual
30:56 difference between seeing consciousness
30:59 and actually manifesting consciousness
31:03 based on your own willpower and your own
31:06 character your your souls true identity
31:10 and true capability in its disposition
31:12 to do things if you don't make that
31:16 separation then again you will own
31:19 things that aren't yours your own
31:20 problems that aren't yours but now what
31:24 if because you know I will say this the
31:29 only reason why you would I'd say reject
31:33 something in your brain which is where
31:35 it becomes apparent to you that
31:36 something's happening is usually when
31:37 you're thinking I thought that you you
31:39 don't accept you don't
31:42 your morals don't agree with it you
31:46 don't really want to ever wake up being
31:47 the person that would have that thought
31:49 on daily basis
31:50 you would never consciously try to
31:52 manifest that thought that's the kind of
31:55 thoughts I'm talking about so probably
31:58 most of videos sort of dark stuff and it
32:00 doesn't have to be super duper dark and
32:02 just be a little bit of like impatience
32:04 or something versus something where
32:06 someone's really making you angry
32:08 hopefully your life is in a circle where
32:10 you don't really have those thoughts
32:11 right and I'm trying to sort out an
32:15 analogy that isn't completely absurd to
32:18 help you out but let me give you a silly
32:22 one but the way I'll describe this
32:24 analogy the one I'm trying to create in
32:26 my head is have you ever spotted
32:29 yourself without knowing you were
32:31 spotting yourself you made it you were
32:33 making a mistake and you didn't know
32:38 you're making the mistake and so you
32:39 were trying to accomplish something and
32:40 you're just screwing up what you're
32:43 trying to accomplish in fact there was a
32:46 there was this video
32:47 my buddy posted of a woman that is
32:50 tasting the broth that she is cooking at
32:52 a walk and she has a ladle up to her
32:55 mouth and she is sipping off of this
32:57 ladle in her left hand she has a spice
33:01 or something this bag of whatever that
33:03 she's trying to put in but she keeps
33:05 putting into the actual source broth in
33:08 the wok so she tastes the ladle she
33:13 pours more into the wok and she tastes
33:15 the ladle again without taking the ladle
33:17 back down to get a new proportion of the
33:20 salt that's inside or whatever it's
33:22 inside this wok so the idea was that she
33:25 wasn't doing this right she meant to
33:28 cook this thing better and make it taste
33:29 better that she wasn't doing it
33:31 correctly the analogy I was gonna give
33:34 you was imagine you're trying to warm up
33:36 your your home you turn the heater on
33:41 and it blows gets you really nice and
33:45 toasty but within seconds you're
33:46 freezing again like what the hell is
33:48 wrong with my house I was warm just a
33:50 second ago and you forget you left the
33:52 back window open to your bathroom the
33:54 back door open to your patio and
33:56 all the hot air is getting sucked out of
33:57 the house so you're making this mistake
34:01 you're doing what you think is right but
34:03 there's this thing you forgot okay keep
34:05 that analogy in your head
34:07 imagine you're opening yourself up to
34:09 all these thoughts you're trying to
34:12 control who you are as a human being
34:14 you're trying to develop and get to the
34:15 next level of consciousness but you got
34:18 the back door open which in this case is
34:20 the door right in front of your face you
34:21 keep looking at the drive-in theater
34:25 seeing things that are just passing by
34:27 and you're owning it when you should
34:30 just be understanding that you're just
34:32 observing it but because for me I have
34:36 47 years of doing it wrong I wouldn't
34:40 say this happens even every day but it
34:42 probably happens every other day where I
34:43 see something and you get you get
34:46 entranced by it because you're studying
34:48 it you know it's like it's you know when
34:51 you're watching a movie you're not
34:53 necessarily all of a sudden paying
34:55 attention to the theater as much right
34:56 and someone has to go like this in front
34:58 of your face say hey you got to get out
35:00 of here you know it's late oh yeah yeah
35:03 yeah and they break your consciousness
35:05 you're glue to the screen that kind of
35:08 happens when you start to observe
35:09 reality you start to observe
35:11 consciousness you start to see a thought
35:13 and if you're like me you've been
35:15 accepting that as your own construction
35:18 but how many times do we make mistakes
35:21 after we figure out what we did wrong
35:24 about too many times right go to the
35:27 air-conditioning thing or heater thing
35:30 right you're heating up your house but
35:31 it keeps getting cold
35:32 the second you remember that you could
35:35 possibly have left a window open or a
35:37 door open the second chair on your sofa
35:39 all wound up in some really cool deep
35:41 thoughts marathon no probably a Netflix
35:44 marathon you got the heater on it gets
35:47 cold you like a hot [ __ ] I got a window
35:49 open somewhere I got the back door open
35:51 someone gets up to get some more popcorn
35:53 I could you check that door because I
35:55 have no le cose right here those
35:58 mistakes stop happening your confusion
36:02 stops happening and what I have found is
36:05 the more that you understand that you're
36:07 observing consciousness that is simply
36:10 manifesting out of the universe you'll
36:13 stop doing it or it's very simple to get
36:17 yourself disengaged from the screen and
36:18 go oh wow that was wild and what I have
36:22 found is powerful is to say out loud
36:24 sometimes if it's more intense just
36:26 simply go
36:27 that's not my thought that's not me I'm
36:31 observing that or you don't really say
36:34 it so detailed but you're just gonna go
36:36 well that was interesting that was
36:37 interesting a little movie I saw ain't
36:39 me man
36:40 I've met a point now where I can just do
36:42 it inside my head on and again doesn't
36:44 happen that often because the frequency
36:46 of these things ceased to be so frequent
36:50 and what's beautiful is now my thoughts
36:53 are mine when I spend my time thinking
36:56 by myself I'm thinking about the script
36:59 I'm writing or the business strategy I'm
37:02 trying to hatch or something it's all my
37:04 time now so I promised I'd talk about
37:09 perhaps an evil source of this and you
37:13 know I sympathize with those of you
37:15 those of you that would roll your eyes
37:17 and go oh here we go and again you need
37:20 to understand I don't walk around
37:21 necessarily thinking about siting I
37:24 don't but then I struggle with the the
37:29 fact that we have to have a left to
37:33 understand the right top to understand a
37:35 bottom
37:36 a bad to understand it good now as I've
37:40 said in several episodes about evil it's
37:44 all relative right when you study acting
37:47 and you study writing especially you
37:50 learn about the Francis Bacon /
37:55 Shakespeare play a fellow if you haven't
38:00 read it you just get you hip to it real
38:02 quick a fellow has a beautiful wife it
38:05 is the wife of wife's she loves him he
38:08 loves her but the fellow has some drama
38:11 in his life and he has a guy that he
38:14 thinks is his best bud sort of an
38:17 adviser named Yago spelled with an i
38:22 Yago is a bastard he starts providing
38:28 this observed consciousness to the king
38:30 in that he says your wife is cheating on
38:33 you where is she right now you know
38:36 where she is right now she's cheating on
38:37 you and the King rejects Iago's
38:41 assertions until he infects the king
38:43 with his consciousness it goes from an
38:47 outside consciousness being manifested
38:50 for evil purposes to manipulate the King
38:53 to going inside the king and him owning
38:56 the consciousness and taking it to the
38:58 next level where eventually at the end
39:02 of the play he believes his wife is
39:06 cheating on you treats her like [ __ ]
39:09 when she has been absolutely anything
39:12 but loyal I mean she's been sorry she
39:15 has been totally loyal to him right when
39:18 you study Iago in writing what they tell
39:20 you is is that from Iago standpoint he's
39:22 not a villain he's doing what benefits
39:26 him to him it's a positive thing that he
39:29 is manipulating the King to hate his
39:31 wife perhaps even killer and when they
39:34 ask really good thespians really good
39:37 actors hey do you like playing evil
39:42 characters I mean is that what you love
39:44 to do a good does being will say I don't
39:47 play evil characters I play the
39:49 character
39:50 only from your perspective are they evil
39:53 but for my mind to play it correctly
39:56 I'm completely serving myself Lex Luthor
40:01 he doesn't think he's doing anything
40:03 wrong he's doing what he likes to do if
40:07 you were to play Lex Luthor you would
40:09 have to understand that perspective of
40:11 his character you can't come on stage
40:14 and say I am playing an evil person I am
40:17 playing an evil person you have to say
40:19 I'm just this guy dude you know I had a
40:24 buddy in my high school I've talked
40:25 about a couple times and shows but he
40:28 was a genius
40:28 absolute genius and you would look at
40:31 him and think he was like a STONER I
40:33 think he was a stoner too but he
40:36 eventually got into crimes because he
40:39 was so bored with everything that school
40:41 had to provide including all the most
40:42 complicated classes that were ever
40:44 taught
40:44 he just a sit and walk off and was like
40:47 he's son of a [ __ ] man do you even
40:49 study
40:49 neaten it's like no I just get it I'm
40:51 like [ __ ] you too he eventually got
40:54 himself murdered because he just in his
41:00 mind he had ascended to a level that
41:02 what was interesting to him was the
41:04 thrill of a crime did he sit around
41:06 thinking about I was hurting people no
41:08 way you don't commit crimes if you think
41:10 those thoughts usually you know the
41:13 people that commit suicide after they
41:15 commit crimes or people that actually do
41:17 empathetically feel the destruction of
41:18 what they did they lost their mind they
41:22 got excited and retaliated if you ever
41:26 watched the movie usual suspects it is
41:32 one of the best movies Kevin Spacey ever
41:34 made mr. pervy Kevin Spacey who again
41:40 from his perspective all of the Cummings
41:44 on he did two fourteen year old kids in
41:46 his brain he wasn't committing any crime
41:47 he was just doing what he wanted to do
41:49 never looked back right he's that kind
41:52 of guy
41:52 he might repent and change his mind but
41:55 like he spent the majority of his life
41:57 doing exactly what he wanted to do and
41:59 of course he's protected because people
42:02 that would put him in jail do the same
42:03 thing
42:04 but inside this film they came up with a
42:07 character called Keyser söze
42:10 and I won't spoil anything for you but
42:13 one of the things that Kevin's character
42:16 did cuz he's being interrogated at a
42:17 police station he's trying to give them
42:19 all the information they need to catch
42:20 the bad guy he said you know the
42:25 greatest trick that the devil ever did
42:26 was to convince you that he doesn't
42:28 exist I'm not so certain the devil's
42:32 exists and I'm not so sure that if he
42:35 did exist he has to work that hard to
42:37 hide his presence in this universe right
42:40 how many people worship celebrities
42:42 right as if they're as if there is any
42:45 benefit to doing that ever if you don't
42:47 understand how you were built and how
42:49 you were put together and how the
42:51 machine works inside the black box
42:52 that's under the hood of your car but it
42:56 if it's working good you don't know and
42:58 if it's working bad you don't know and
42:59 if it breaks you don't know why what I
43:02 have found in becoming aware of this
43:04 particular mechanism is that I'm in
43:07 control I'm in a lot more control of the
43:10 inside of my brain I am more peaceful
43:13 because I do not take responsibility for
43:16 random moments of consciousness that I
43:21 happen to observe I think that perhaps I
43:24 suffered this more because I write and
43:30 when you write you're constantly
43:31 reaching out to the universe for
43:32 scenario what's going on in this scene
43:36 why do I give a [ __ ] once you study
43:40 writing even further and realized there
43:41 has to be conflict it goes back and
43:44 forth between positive and negative
43:45 positive and negative see episode 7 if
43:47 you understand this intimately you sort
43:52 of forcibly open the door to external
43:54 consciousness but you then write down to
43:57 hopefully make money and entertain
43:58 people at some point to expand thought
44:01 through metaphor I think that the story
44:05 of Satan is actually fairly interesting
44:07 for anyone pardon the pun struggling
44:10 with their demons because what ends up
44:13 happening is is that you're able to
44:14 through that religious metaphor /
44:17 paradigm
44:17 keep evil things outside of yourself
44:21 because you feel like they're attacking
44:23 you and once you start to say I am NOT
44:27 this person who was having these evil
44:29 thoughts or something you know something
44:30 type of thing again I hope that very few
44:33 of you have truly evil thoughts but you
44:35 know you know those moments really like
44:36 oh my god I was so short in my brain
44:38 towards that person but I didn't say a
44:40 lot of movies have done this right well
44:41 though someone will be standing in line
44:43 for coffee and someone cuts in front of
44:45 them and also the movie continues where
44:47 they they you know Jason Bourne this guy
44:50 down to the ground and break their neck
44:52 and then they go up to get their coffee
44:53 and then boom we flash back to reality
44:55 and they're they haven't done anything
44:57 but the movie showed us what they were
44:59 thinking it's basically that mechanism
45:01 inside your brain I will tell you that
45:04 the power of speaking out loud
45:07 is really unprecedented for controlling
45:10 the inside of your mind
45:13 and I know I've met folks that say oh
45:16 boy if you ever talk to yourself first
45:17 foot second you're a [ __ ] nut bag and
45:20 that's because that's how their paradigm
45:21 works and then you look at their life
45:23 and they're kind of out of control I
45:26 have a close friend of mine who has a
45:30 driving phobia this person was fine when
45:37 they were younger and as they get older
45:39 they're more and more terrified of
45:40 driving a car on the highway and I will
45:43 say that you know if you've never driven
45:45 on California highways it is definitely
45:47 an intense experience we have up to
45:50 eight lanes at times going in one
45:52 direction and people are you know
45:55 screaming in from the carpool lane and
45:57 they're screaming to the car pull a
45:58 trying to get the fast lane they're
46:00 trying to they forgot their exit and so
46:02 instead of just paying their dues and
46:04 going to the next exit and turning
46:05 around they are driving over the medium
46:08 right in front of you kicking up all
46:09 kinds of debris on your car I mean it's
46:11 it can be really intense so I don't
46:13 blame these people for having this
46:15 phobia I met two women who had this
46:18 issue but my friend is tough and she's
46:24 strong and so she is saying I'm not
46:28 going to [ __ ] out to this problem I
46:32 can't change the fact that it you know
46:34 she says to me I can't change the fact
46:36 that I get anxiety in the morning when
46:39 I'm putting my makeup on I get the
46:40 shakes because I know I'm about to get
46:42 up to my car luckily she's able to
46:44 travel everywhere in Orange County
46:46 without having to hit the highway when
46:48 you have to hit the highway the husband
46:50 takes the wheel and he's a patient
46:52 wonderful man who doesn't make her feel
46:55 bad for having for having gone through
46:57 this or going through this right now but
47:00 I sat down with her the other day and we
47:03 talked about it for the first time and
47:05 really intense detail and I just did you
47:09 know the friendly psychotherapy of just
47:12 like okay tell me what that what the
47:14 stages are of going through this issue
47:17 I said tell me where you've had a lot of
47:19 control
47:20 have you ever beat it on a particular
47:22 day when it was on you and I said well
47:23 what does it feel like when this anxiety
47:25 hits when you're driving this is one
47:27 thing to have anxiety before you get
47:29 behind the wheel but when you get behind
47:30 the wheel and grab the steering wheel I
47:32 said you know I asked her questions like
47:34 do you feel like you don't know how big
47:36 your vehicle is because she drives a
47:38 fairly large SUV said nope
47:40 life like in parallel park just fine I
47:42 you know I don't have any problems
47:44 getting around in the vehicle I know
47:45 where my fenders are so well that's good
47:48 because that's the first thing that
47:49 really makes people a bad drivers if
47:50 they switch vehicles from the small into
47:52 a big one and they no longer know how
47:54 big it is they're bumping into stuff
47:55 right maybe that's where the fears nope
47:58 not for her she said to me something I'd
48:01 never heard before and what I love about
48:04 her is that she's super intelligent and
48:06 articulate so I was able to hear
48:08 something that you just don't get out of
48:11 these people very often right and the
48:14 other woman I knew it was over 25 years
48:16 ago and the woman wasn't articulate and
48:21 was scared of a lot of different things
48:22 so I thought yeah she's just a bag of
48:23 problems there's too much to sort out
48:26 can't help her but this most recent
48:29 friend of mine she said and if you think
48:33 about my dream episodes this this will
48:35 ring a bell with you guys
48:36 she said I'm holding onto the steering
48:38 wheel driving down the street and she
48:40 goes I suddenly feel like my arms aren't
48:43 really there she goes I lose the sense
48:47 of touch on the steering wheel because
48:49 my anxiety builds so much it overwhelms
48:51 my circuitry and I lose I lose a
48:55 connection with my instrumentalities my
48:57 hands my arms my feet so I got a foot on
48:59 the accelerator I know I can get it over
49:02 to the brake but it feels like almost
49:03 like when your foot falls asleep and it
49:05 feels like it's someone else's foot
49:06 attached to your body right
49:09 and you know in dreams we don't really
49:12 have our arms and our legs we imagine
49:14 them to be there
49:15 and I have a dream episode where I talk
49:17 about someone asking me to write my
49:18 phone number down and my mind had to
49:22 make my hands exist and the more I tried
49:26 to write my hands felt like a wet noodle
49:28 and I didn't really have the $0.05
49:30 system that I have in this reality and
49:32 so I just willed my number onto the
49:35 piece of paper which kept changing and
49:37 changing and changing she's having that
49:40 feeling in this consciousness in this
49:42 reality I said well you know when have
49:47 you ever beat this she said yeah she
49:49 goes she's not religious okay but this
49:54 will make you chuckle and it made her
49:56 laugh because she goes I almost feel
49:57 like I was crazy she goes I have a
49:59 relative that's very religious and when
50:02 I told her about me having this
50:04 experience she said you need to pray to
50:05 Jesus to get rid of this experience and
50:11 so it got to the point where shortly
50:15 after having that conversation and she's
50:17 an open-minded person which is another
50:19 beautiful attribute of her she's driving
50:21 down the street and it started happening
50:25 to her and she started kind of yelling
50:27 out loud she said by herself you know
50:31 Jesus get this away from me and she said
50:35 it I guess four or five times that she
50:37 goes within seconds it disappeared now
50:41 she says that when it happens is only
50:43 like 10 or 15 seconds but when you're
50:44 driving that could be the difference
50:45 between life and death right but now
50:48 here's the interesting thing sure she
50:50 says this and she said you know I felt
50:52 silly saying this because I don't have
50:54 any major devotion to any religion all
50:58 of us were raised Catholic around here
51:00 and then we broke out but she said it
51:04 went away and it went away and then it
51:07 didn't come back as quickly as it came
51:11 back before she said that and then she
51:15 now sort of says the same thing love she
51:17 mentions Jesus in the second iteration
51:19 but talking out loud
51:21 allowed her consciousness to ramp up
51:25 come to the forefront almost like
51:27 soldiers going to the border of the war
51:30 the frontlines and they're able to knock
51:33 it down
51:35 but just the thing is it was almost like
51:39 training wheels speaking out loud where
51:41 the training wheels to sort of
51:43 reorganize how her brain works
51:44 internally and she looked at me and she
51:48 goes don't think I'm crazy okay what I'm
51:50 about to say and I said it's not gonna
51:52 happen
51:53 go ahead she said you know after I said
51:57 that it took this this weird anxiety
52:00 that I've always had my entire life
52:01 which is now a driving anxiety problem
52:04 and it made me feel like I'm being
52:06 attacked by something it's not a part of
52:09 me and then as long as I reject it
52:11 consciously it gets pushed away it's
52:16 breaking the habit and it's building a
52:18 paradigm of control and that's what I
52:21 want for any of you that are struggling
52:22 with this sort of thing and again it it
52:24 doesn't have to be like you're
52:25 struggling you know you've got to see a
52:27 psychiatrist or you're struggling in
52:28 your life is misery nananana it's just
52:31 that annoying goddamn thing that happens
52:33 in your brain you're like god dammit I
52:35 just wasted 30 seconds of my life
52:37 thinking about how to punch this guy's
52:39 lights out and I don't want to have
52:43 those kind of thoughts and I certainly
52:45 don't want to have them have my time
52:47 stolen from me by something living in my
52:50 brain because I'm letting it in because
52:53 I don't before this I didn't believe
52:55 that there was an ownership model of the
52:58 different pieces and parts of my
52:59 consciousness right so I told her back
53:03 because she was worried about even
53:04 though I said I wouldn't think she's
53:06 crazy I wanted to prove to her that I
53:08 don't think she's crazy and I I don't
53:14 know how much I've shared I think I've
53:15 shared this in little bits and pieces
53:17 and other episodes about perhaps the
53:20 afterlife or something like that but
53:23 I have you know a belief in
53:25 reincarnation I have a belief in and
53:28 this is through just listening to my
53:31 soul and listening to my gut and
53:33 listening to and keeping track of a
53:34 chronological chronologically taking
53:39 care of the moments of inspiration and
53:41 epiphany that have given me invention
53:43 given me creativity it gave me strength
53:46 to do the right thing to perform better
53:48 if I'm gonna go on stage and talk to a
53:50 bunch of people I believe that there's
53:53 some mezzanine out there between life
53:56 and death and resurrection that you can
54:00 hang around for a little while you know
54:03 I don't think my great-great-great
54:04 great-great grandfather still hanging
54:05 around looking at me because he doesn't
54:07 know me he's like you know I'll leave
54:08 that to the generations that are closer
54:10 to you I'm gonna go off and do this but
54:12 a visit God for a little while chill out
54:14 and then I'm gonna go down and find
54:15 myself a nice errand time to be
54:17 reincarnated with a certain level of
54:19 difficulty that I've never done if I
54:21 take a break and become Steven Steven
54:23 Spielberg maybe I go in and become a
54:26 child in the the slumdog area of India
54:29 if you've ever been stuck in a loop
54:32 where your life isn't going the way you
54:33 want it to if you take the attack that
54:38 you are going to bring in your forces
54:41 you know a lot of men definitely have
54:44 had the emotion of you you think about
54:47 well if you're an American you know
54:50 we're the big superpower blah blah blah
54:51 and we have the best of the best of
54:54 everything right Navy SEALs and Delta
54:56 Force and all these guys right and so
54:58 you think about in your brain well I got
55:00 my own Delta Force you know I got my own
55:01 guys that can fight for me in girls
55:04 really genderless souls I would say and
55:07 if you asked for their help I think you
55:10 can get it and so I said you're just
55:12 asking for help but you're also
55:15 realizing it's not a part of you and
55:17 that's super important and I will tell
55:20 you that the most beautiful moment of
55:22 our conversation and we reviewed a lot
55:25 of techniques for removing the anxiety
55:28 and controlling her own temple tempo of
55:31 her own thoughts one of the things I
55:34 mentioned to her just in case it's
55:35 useful India
55:36 you anxiety usually is a feedback loop
55:39 of frequency right so you're getting
55:42 addicted at that and it's like you need
55:44 to be both and one of the things I've
55:49 done there was a physical thing I
55:52 learned first that became a mental way
55:54 to meditate was that I was a lifeguard
55:58 in high school and I always liked to
56:00 challenge my body and being underwater
56:04 for a really long period of time you'll
56:06 hold your breath and function it was
56:08 always a fascinating thing for me and my
56:09 city pool where I lived was so utterly
56:13 massive that even though I could hold my
56:14 breath and swim for at least a minute
56:16 straight our pool was so wide like a
56:21 cross not the lengthwise lengthwise you
56:25 could never do it take your 3 minutes to
56:26 swim this thing if you never stop
56:28 swimming to get the lengthwise but the
56:30 width of it was so massive it took one
56:33 minute to get across this thing
56:34 underwater and I was pretty buff and I
56:38 could swim my ass off at the very end
56:39 I'm exhaling and feeling pain you know
56:43 that's how wide this thing was so what I
56:44 would do is obviously take big deep
56:45 breaths and expand my lungs and hold
56:47 them and expand and hold them and expand
56:49 but inside my brain I created this
56:51 beacon it's sort of like those lights
56:54 you find on antennas that keep planes
56:56 from running into transmission towers
56:58 right but their big piece of glass you
57:00 know like like this big kind of like
57:02 radio tube they're red and they have
57:06 like this metal cage around them so
57:07 birds can't can't get on him easily and
57:12 I would see that thing and I would make
57:14 this pulse this nice slow pulse and I
57:17 could feel my heartbeat the more I held
57:19 my breath you know it's expanding my
57:21 lungs and I could feel my heart and I
57:24 would just see this this red light
57:27 throbbing because it never quite shuts
57:29 off you know it's like an arc welding
57:30 bulb in there or something I know what
57:32 the hell it is but it never quite goes
57:33 dim but I would always make that red
57:36 light slower than my heart and
57:39 eventually my heart through my
57:42 consciousness would match
57:44 the throbbing red kind of soothing red
57:48 lantern that is this cautionary beacon
57:52 need time I get my blood pressure taken
57:54 and I can feel my blood pressure in my
57:57 bicep I immediately in a second I can
58:02 feel my heartbeat as a second I can slow
58:04 it down it's interesting but it's
58:05 because of years of doing this but where
58:09 I might be getting in some heavier
58:11 frequency I don't think I ever really
58:14 have anxiety I don't think I've ever had
58:16 it as you can tell on the show but if
58:18 ever gets faster than I wanted to go I
58:19 use that technique to slow it down I
58:21 told I said when you're in the mirror in
58:23 the morning and you're putting your
58:24 makeup on you feel that lack of control
58:27 over your own frequency because the
58:29 shaking of hands is obviously the rhythm
58:31 between every shake is a sine wave of
58:35 how fast you're processing this
58:37 terrifying thought and I said just stare
58:41 into the mirror 60,000 feet right forget
58:44 your focus on your face and see the
58:46 beacon and slow it down but the beacon
58:49 be sort of the central processing unit
58:52 of your body of your mind of your
58:55 consciousness and let it soothe you and
59:00 so by the time you get in the car it's
59:02 sort of like you had a whole body
59:03 massage and you feel really good it's
59:07 hard to be really angsty and pissed off
59:10 after you've had a full-body massage
59:12 it's the truth right and let me remind
59:17 you guys because I say this every once
59:18 in a while and shows you could have a
59:21 wife a husband and a bunch of kids
59:24 buddies girlfriends whatever and you can
59:29 get into a era of your life where no one
59:31 ever touches you and you you get into
59:36 these eras in your life where you you
59:39 don't consciously realize your whole
59:41 epidermis is tight and you need to have
59:45 and your frequencies inside your
59:46 meridians your electrical circuits
59:48 inside your glands and your body are all
59:52 jumbled up
59:54 it's like a bunch of headset knots you
59:57 know it's like your shoe strings are all
59:59 tied in big blobby knots and you just
60:01 need someone to touch you
60:04 the Russians have these clinics that do
60:07 this and they they may or may not do any
60:10 type of real deep tissue rubbing that
60:12 helps because it digs down inside your
60:15 body inside your muscle tissue and gets
60:17 everything straightened out but I've
60:18 seen Russian clinics where they just put
60:22 their hands on you and they'll go all
60:24 over your head and they're always
60:25 pulling in top-to-bottom directions
60:27 always in the same direction same
60:29 direction because your feet are the
60:30 toxic in-circuit of your legs and your
60:34 palms are the in circuits for your arms
60:37 but you'll find out that the people that
60:39 are touching you in these institutions
60:41 are usually very calm themselves they're
60:44 naturally that way which is why they're
60:46 led to be caregivers and they just pull
60:48 down the body pull down the body and
60:50 these people will walk out we have these
60:52 places in California they call foot
60:54 massage places I've described it once
60:57 before but it's $15 for one hour so you
61:01 can tip them another 15 bucks and
61:02 they're happy as can be
61:05 but they're not licensed masseuses
61:07 because they're from China on their
61:09 green cards right on their work visas or
61:12 maybe not but you stay relatively close
61:18 during the process and you're in a room
61:20 with probably another 30 people who are
61:21 getting the same treatment so the hive
61:24 mind in the room is wonderful like
61:25 they're playing obviously music they got
61:27 a water tank out front it's all really
61:29 chill and they do your have you sit down
61:34 they do your neck and your back first
61:36 and then you lay face up and they do the
61:39 top part of you and they make you face
61:40 down they do finish the back part of you
61:41 you get up you put your shirt back on
61:44 you're out of there right but when
61:45 you're walking back to your car as I've
61:48 experienced several times you feel like
61:51 you have been liberated from your
61:54 intense nature and your epidermis is
61:57 finally relaxing and for unit 1 you'll
62:00 sleep like crazy manual at the deepest
62:03 amazing sleep good dreams
62:07 nothing will haunt you the next day
62:09 you're just all relaxed and cool and
62:12 when you're relaxed and you're cool you
62:14 start to notice that everything else is
62:15 going a lot faster than you and that
62:17 might sound like you've [ __ ] your
62:19 brain a little bit from processing
62:20 information in an efficient way but it
62:23 actually what you're doing is you're
62:24 taking that step back well the greatest
62:28 piece of advice that you can get from
62:30 anyone about having a conversation
62:32 especially a complicated conversation
62:34 with someone it could be business could
62:36 be a relationship conversation but it's
62:40 one of those conversations where you
62:41 could lose control of it and get excited
62:43 in perhaps a way that you're excited
62:46 they're agitated or whatever and a lot
62:49 of you know this technique but it's
62:51 called the pause someone is asking you a
62:55 question especially during interviews
62:56 this is very powerful well do you do
62:59 this what do you like better this are
63:00 done what do you about this really tough
63:02 scenario where you got an employee
63:03 that's doing this you're gonna be
63:04 managing some of our employees so
63:06 they've got this scenario pop up up
63:07 above let me put on a real complex thing
63:09 out in front of your face or it's
63:11 something that you usually need jerk the
63:13 answer to and if you just pause for a
63:17 second
63:19 just think about it and you're like you
63:22 know no I think that in my experience
63:25 this has been the best thing boom the
63:29 level of control that you exude from
63:32 your being to the other person is
63:35 extremely powerful and they're like wow
63:37 that pause feels like wisdom the young
63:41 kid would just go BLAP BLAP BLAP BLAP
63:43 all the answers but as you get a little
63:45 older you're like well you know I know
63:47 that sounds like a cut and dry answer
63:49 but we all know that there are
63:51 contingencies to the cut and dry first
63:54 impression maybe the first impression is
63:57 correct but you're gonna think about it
63:58 and confirm it against other techniques
64:00 right what is that old technique if you
64:03 get absolutely infuriated they say count
64:06 to 10 I know that sounds hokey and goofy
64:10 but jeez it works it freakin works you
64:14 know again hopefully you've got your
64:16 life in a situation where you don't have
64:18 to do these techniques because you've
64:20 picked your friends carefully you
64:22 actually make sure you're they're your
64:24 friends I've got an episode on friends
64:25 which sounds a little hokey but if you
64:28 listen to it the people who've listened
64:29 to it have really understood that I even
64:31 though I might give an episode a single
64:33 word and it looks a little goofy it has
64:37 a lot of value in it
64:39 observe consciousness you don't have to
64:42 own everything that goes through your
64:44 consciousness understand that things are
64:48 being presented to you because the
64:50 universe is a big giant place with a big
64:54 civilization where we do transmit
64:56 information to each other you could be
64:59 having a great day and you go home and
65:01 all of a sudden you're agitated for some
65:02 reason and there's no reason for you to
65:04 be agitated you're well-fed you've had a
65:06 good sleep
65:07 your family's behaving wonderfully your
65:09 friends are good to you may help maybe
65:11 someone called you up and said I just
65:12 want to tell you you're awesome and
65:13 you're just feeling angsty and weird for
65:17 all you know your neighbor is having the
65:19 worst day of their life and they're not
65:22 in there they're not in our circuit of
65:24 control and trying to expand your mind
65:26 and and really control your destiny so
65:29 they're over there panicking and getting
65:31 and what have you and you don't realize
65:33 it but your office in your house or your
65:35 living room is within hivemind reach of
65:38 their brain because they are so insanely
65:41 intense that broadcast frequency out of
65:43 their consciousness is really starting
65:45 to sweep up the entire neighborhood and
65:49 the whole neighborhood can just go south
65:51 for a night until that one person stops
65:54 making it but then you've got this viral
65:55 infection and if we don't all have
65:58 control of our consciousness that guy
66:00 comes down within ten minutes but the
66:02 neighbor across the street has anxiety
66:03 for two days the one thing I also want
66:06 to mention in terms of detoxification I
66:08 wish I had remembered this at the
66:09 beginning of the episode because I tend
66:10 to lose people before the end here and
66:13 there is that sugar which is very bad
66:18 for the human body on almost every level
66:20 I know we are we all are addicted to it
66:22 and you do need to eat it but just
66:24 realize everything you eat gets
66:25 converted to a sugar if it's not a fat
66:28 as I always say fat can't become a sugar
66:30 and sugar cannot be a become a fat that
66:32 sugar can hide inside fat so be careful
66:36 but sugar has turned into energy in the
66:38 body you know one of the things I told
66:40 my friend I said look you need to
66:43 monitor your sugar intake versus this
66:45 anxiety and her immediate reply was no
66:49 no no this is a mental problem not a
66:51 physical problem I said well how do you
66:54 think you manifest energy to run your
66:55 brain calorie energy from sugar and so
67:01 be careful with sugar in the morning
67:05 sugar in the afternoon sugar in the
67:07 evening and start to if you have anxiety
67:09 of any kind
67:11 or this process of observed
67:13 consciousness that is not the kind of
67:15 consciousness you want to have take a
67:17 moment and study when you last ate a
67:21 bunch of sugar at the same time people
67:24 are hypoglycemic you can have a point
67:28 where you're going into anxiety because
67:30 you don't have any sugar but the
67:32 hypoglycemia and the like a diabetic
67:36 when there need a little bit of sugar
67:38 they'll start to shut down and they
67:40 start to lose all of their senses
67:42 instead of getting anxiety they start to
67:44 go into a droney state one of the most
67:48 educated experiences I had because my
67:50 video game company I actually got a
67:53 company called diabetes games that we
67:55 made diabetic games which you play the
67:58 game just like a normal game but it was
67:59 teaching you about your diabetic habits
68:02 that you need to have you're testing
68:05 yourself and all that kind of stuff but
68:08 I was in line at a Mexican restaurant at
68:10 a at a mall they're like the food court
68:13 with my good friend from work and he
68:15 told me he was diabetic you know we
68:17 talked about it I ordered I was in front
68:20 of him second he's buffet things you
68:22 know and he becomes time for him to
68:25 order and he is starting to shut down he
68:28 had hit a level of I guess too much
68:31 insulin or something and he is trying to
68:34 say
68:35 slowly I need a little bit of diet coke
68:40 with real coke on top again we didn't
68:43 know how bad coke was back in those days
68:45 especially aspartame and the beautiful
68:49 thing was is that everyone in line spoke
68:50 very little English they knew how to
68:52 take orders but the owner was obviously
68:56 fluent in English and Spanish and he
69:00 just looked at my buddy and I'm trying
69:02 to understand him like this is all
69:03 happening like boom like that right and
69:05 this guy goes in Spanish man and it was
69:11 it was one of the most heroic simple
69:15 moments I've ever witnessed in my life
69:16 these this girl at the at the soda
69:20 machine man she did a cup boom she's bam
69:23 boom and
69:24 to him he takes a sip and within like 20
69:27 seconds boom he's back and I'll never
69:31 forget that but I've also seen friends
69:33 of mine of hypoglycaemic the opposite
69:35 and they have to keep little candy bars
69:37 around and they go into the opposite
69:42 loop or their stuttering and shaking
69:45 like crazy because their body is
69:48 starting to shut down and it's a it's a
69:51 really odd thing that it goes in the
69:52 opposite direction you would almost
69:55 think it'd be the opposite right but
69:58 I've seen someone start to have this in
70:02 a car and they always kept a candy bar
70:04 in their glove compartment and I watched
70:07 this woman start to just start to just
70:10 jitter and she couldn't talk and she was
70:12 she didn't worry about it but she was
70:14 having this attack she'd had it several
70:16 times so she wasn't in sight probably
70:19 panicky as much as outside looked like
70:20 she was but she just reached into the
70:22 thing and got the wrapper off and jammed
70:24 it in her mouth and she did well as well
70:27 strange right but be aware of your
70:30 energy consumption if you start to have
70:34 any sort of of these issues we made it
70:37 we made it through the hour that's cool
70:39 hopefully this was valuable to you guys
70:42 again really interested in your take on
70:45 this I have not met another human being
70:47 that has talked about this sort of thing
70:49 so if those of you listening have had
70:51 this sort of understanding for years
70:54 please share your experience about when
70:57 you became conscious of such a thing any
71:00 other related research would be great to
71:04 see it website URL or a video or
71:06 something that would be great if you
71:10 have made a deep thoughts radio.com
