00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen I have not done a night
00:36 episode in quite a while actually so
00:38 this is kind of fun even though I've got
00:40 about three inside the queue mm-hmm
00:44 tonight I'm gonna talk about something
00:46 that'll be more for your avid listener
00:49 than probably your passerby I have a
00:54 million titles for this thing so I'm not
00:56 quite exactly sure what I'm gonna call
00:58 this thing but it's it has to do with
01:05 that old saying of having some skin in
01:07 the game it has to do with what we call
01:11 in the modern-day lexicon Nutting up
01:14 because two days ago I was at my lounge
01:18 and there was a guy that I guess I'd
01:21 never seen him before but talking to the
01:23 owner he says he comes by about every
01:25 six months
01:27 all-american dude white guy probably in
01:32 his late 40s early 50s it's gonna give
01:34 you that profile so you can kind of toss
01:36 that around your head he's in Orange
01:39 County and we were watching some
01:42 fictional thing can remember I can't
01:45 remember exactly what we were watching
01:46 but just something on the TV and he was
01:49 sort of talking a lot and at a lounge
01:53 you know it depends on what's going on
01:57 inside the lounge but we usually
01:58 typically for a watching Game of Thrones
02:00 or West World or something any type of
02:04 show we don't talk all the way through
02:07 it now if you're sitting next to
02:09 somebody and you whisper over and they
02:11 seem to be receptive to your your quips
02:14 and your whims and your little jokes
02:17 your anecdotes then go for it so we
02:21 noticed you know it was starting to get
02:22 a little bit of annoying a little bit
02:24 annoying and I could tell like those of
02:30 us that come all the time we're all in
02:32 sync about how we handle these things
02:33 and so luckily the the show was over the
02:39 episode of whatever we're watching was
02:40 over
02:42 he stops it and he goes into some of the
02:45 conspiracy videos just to kind of see
02:46 what's going on and then here comes the
02:51 sort of political platitudes if you will
02:54 the overused sort of capitulating give
03:00 up mentality phrases all these
03:03 catchphrases I always tell you guys
03:05 about that are really dangerous because
03:08 it equips your mind to give up you know
03:12 clips like this are you know well
03:15 everything causes cancer you know all
03:18 politicians are corrupt that down the
03:21 line and so you just give up life's a
03:24 [ __ ] and then you die leaving the rest
03:28 of us who don't want to live that life
03:31 you know that all those catchphrases are
03:34 complete [ __ ] or at least it
03:37 shouldn't be that way and let's change
03:39 it so I thought this guy would run out
03:42 of steam but he was just I don't know
03:48 personally whether or not he was trying
03:51 to sound smart or what-have-you but he
03:55 just simply could not shut the [ __ ] up
03:58 and so I start looking over at the owner
04:03 I start looking at him and he well first
04:08 we just eventually just kind of started
04:10 trying correct a little bit of what he
04:12 was saying here in there cuz he just had
04:14 a bunch of [ __ ] wrong I mean just watch
04:17 the [ __ ] news man this guy would had
04:18 everything he was talking about you know
04:23 litigated in a different way than what
04:25 he was saying and he says he was a
04:27 registered independent which is cool I
04:30 don't care about that sounds good right
04:32 in the center of left and right but if
04:35 actually we started leaning into this
04:37 guy because he just kept giving up on
04:39 society and I'm sick and tired of that
04:43 [ __ ] sick and tired you don't have to be
04:46 involved in being part of the solution
04:48 right
04:49 you could hear about the Great Awakening
04:50 and the 17 movement and all this other
04:52 stuff and just simply say you're too
04:54 busy
04:54 you're suffering some other issue and
04:57 you can't get involved totally have
04:59 respect for that that's great
05:01 but to sit around and sorta you know get
05:04 coffee for the the Nazis during World
05:07 War two
05:08 you know I don't know but have a good
05:11 reason but if this guy was duplicated
05:14 350 million times to comprise the DNA of
05:19 this country of the indigenous
05:21 population not even counting the
05:23 immigrants that are doing what they're
05:25 doing
05:26 America would be done in a microsecond
05:30 because this guy is just a big pile of
05:33 [ __ ] man just ready to give up on
05:35 absolutely everything well it's just the
05:38 way it is and so finally I just looked
05:40 at them and I said well you should just
05:41 put that gun in your mouth pull the
05:42 [ __ ] trigger dude you're giving up on
05:45 absolutely everything that this country
05:47 stands for
05:48 the Constitution according to you
05:50 doesn't have any purpose it was a silly
05:53 idea you're ready to go right back into
05:55 a monarchy some sort of a tyrannical
05:58 world and once he was called out oh then
06:02 he tries to backpedal but the problem is
06:03 his brains a little sparse okay and so
06:07 he's trying to recover realizing he's
06:09 been sort of he's in a different group
06:12 and so eventually we just start taking
06:16 him down one thing at a time and what
06:18 was really funny is my buddy owns the
06:21 lounge he was actually smart enough to
06:22 say you're not ready for the truth
06:25 I can tell so we'll just try to give you
06:28 the basics and what he was really
06:31 talking about is the 17 movement you're
06:33 not ready dude not even for the
06:36 insinuation of what that thing is all
06:37 about and that's what I want to talk
06:40 about is this whole thing this decision
06:43 you have to make to get your ass into
06:45 the game to care what is not important
06:50 is that you activate for every single
06:54 thing that's going on in the world in
06:57 your country and your local community
07:00 but I guarantee you you know save any
07:04 major situation that's going on in your
07:06 life and again
07:08 I think everybody knows that if
07:09 something major happens in your life and
07:11 you're fully preoccupied with that we're
07:13 not talking to you you go take care of
07:14 your life
07:15 Godspeed you know sometimes it's good to
07:19 let people know you need some prayers or
07:21 some help
07:22 you know but there's a lot of lazy
07:25 people out there tons of time they know
07:29 everything about every sports score in
07:31 the world they know everything about
07:34 every TV show that's their favorite TV
07:37 show hey you can work that into you know
07:40 what to give up what you love but you
07:42 should probably drag in at least one
07:43 agenda that you can champion something
07:45 that you feel compassionate about do you
07:48 like being free hmm maybe there's a
07:51 million things attached to that that
07:52 that are being drowned out in this
07:55 country political correctness alone is a
07:57 jail cell for the mind it incubates
08:00 doublethink doublespeak
08:02 you can't use a word for what it really
08:04 means because it offends some goddamn
08:07 snowflakes somewhere that you may never
08:09 run into but people like to be right and
08:12 people like to extort your behavior
08:15 because they've got this little paradigm
08:17 on you that says you said a dirty word
08:19 it's dirty now and the cleaning board
08:22 that we're gonna give you to replace
08:23 this dirty word well that clean word
08:25 will be a dirty word in ten years and
08:27 we're just gonna continue this [ __ ]
08:28 game or this treadmill of controlling
08:31 you with political correctness and all
08:35 this other liberal crap that's out there
08:37 and again you know spare me all these
08:40 arguments well you know should we let
08:42 people call people in words it's like no
08:45 idiot no one is saying this extremist
08:50 thing right and this guy started using
08:51 that extremist crap to win his arguments
08:54 once he started losing and I [ __ ]
08:55 nailed that guy in two seconds I said
08:57 look don't do that [ __ ] I said a [ __ ]
09:00 uses extremist arguments to you know
09:02 positions to win an argument
09:04 meaning if you continue talking like
09:07 that I'm calling you a [ __ ] [ __ ] to
09:08 your face what are gonna do about it he
09:11 was trying to defend the new Green Deal
09:14 he was so completely uninformed about
09:17 what's actually in that bill it was
09:19 hilarious
09:20 and as we
09:21 to tell him what's in the bill because
09:23 we have seen over 300 videos reading it
09:26 to the monitor reading it to us sitting
09:28 in the room literally reading the text
09:30 as someone Scrolls up the new green deal
09:34 this guy's telling us that's not what
09:36 it's what's really in there you got that
09:38 wrong it's like dude where did you spend
09:43 your spare time I mean seriously
09:46 well he bought a bunch of booze - he
09:47 bought a bunch of beer cans with him
09:49 when he was there you know hey I drink
09:54 beer myself but this guy just couldn't
09:56 sit down and you know chill out we've
10:01 got nice things there our own private
10:05 collection of that kind of stuff but
10:07 it's just a lazy dude it was a lazy
10:09 citizen of this country not someone you
10:13 would be terribly proud to call an
10:15 American to be quite honest and I know
10:16 we're not supposed to see those kind of
10:18 things but that's the truth I wouldn't
10:20 hold this guy up if someone said show me
10:22 an American and guys go away towards the
10:25 end of the list but doesn't have to do
10:28 with America does it America is an idea
10:32 America is an idea of freedom hatched in
10:37 Europe Magna Carta Britain around a
10:41 thousand beasts a thousand ad excuse me
10:43 that's you know the robber barons as
10:47 they were called had incubated up
10:50 hundreds of years of monarch and Roman
10:52 repression and said we're not gonna do
10:55 this anymore you're gonna sign this king
10:56 or we're gonna throw you out and of
10:59 course the King signs it and then
11:00 immediately starts to mess with these
11:02 people trying to take away the power you
11:05 know within 490 years later it's all
11:09 back to the monarchy there is no
11:12 semblance of freedom in Europe until
11:14 what well a bunch of Masons and Templars
11:20 sailed ships over here and took this
11:23 land
11:24 unfortunately away from the Native
11:25 Americans and then away from England and
11:31 France and Spain in all of Europe
11:34 and we are built out of people from
11:36 France in Spain and all of Europe and
11:38 the Queen of England of course and now
11:44 they want it back and so they put the
11:46 16th amendment into this country and
11:47 they've taken away the control of our
11:49 monetary system and since then they have
11:53 controlled us and that's what's wrong
11:56 that's one of the first things that's
11:58 super duper wrong with what's going on
12:00 over here but as soon as we had this
12:02 experiment going by 1776 guess who heard
12:06 about it and guess who started doing the
12:07 same thing the rest of the world again
12:11 this isn't necessarily our superduper
12:13 complement and then the world is a bunch
12:16 of dodo birds we came from over there to
12:21 here you understand this is a world
12:24 thing every single human being wants
12:26 freedom but because some people are
12:30 afraid of the world they're afraid of
12:33 people like Donald Trump because he's
12:34 assertive they just want to have someone
12:38 take care of them some people dig jail
12:41 in prisons because they kind of get
12:43 taken care of you don't have to get a
12:45 job your meals are there every day as
12:46 crappy as they are they're there and you
12:49 know you like drama and adrenaline
12:52 flowing through your system dopamine or
12:53 all that kind of stuff where there's
12:56 your commissary over there for your
12:58 dopamine as far as your adrenaline is
13:00 concerned well just stick around long
13:02 enough and some will pick a fight with
13:04 you and you get all that drama
13:06 there's a point where you make the
13:09 decision whether or not you're going to
13:11 stand up for yourself and then there's a
13:16 decision you make of as to whether or
13:17 not you're going to stand up for someone
13:18 else and what I think is really
13:21 interesting is that we have a bunch of
13:23 people in this country right now that
13:26 are willing to stand up for something
13:28 but they're so ignorant some of them are
13:32 actually stupid that they're standing up
13:35 for the wrong thing they are fighting
13:38 for the globalists they won't do any
13:43 history on socialism any history on the
13:46 world itself
13:48 what types of governments have we have
13:50 we attempted and how did it turn out if
13:54 you run a country with morals how does
13:56 it turn out when you run a country with
13:58 no morals how does that turn out it's no
14:02 mystery than the United States of
14:04 America every single Democrat that's
14:07 ever been able to be a mayor a governor
14:09 those states in those cities go down the
14:12 tubes as quickly as possible because you
14:15 know why they're so utterly ill-informed
14:18 as a human being of what the human
14:20 condition requires to have a true
14:23 prosperous world but they just let
14:26 anything happen it turns into utter
14:29 chaos instead of having some structure
14:33 now what's really difficult for some of
14:35 us to understand and I'm definitely one
14:37 of them is this position of being
14:41 extremely weak I think that being
14:45 coddled makes you weak I don't think
14:48 that's a big profound statement right so
14:51 some people have been so caught up by
14:54 their parents their grandparents by
14:55 society in some way shape or form they
14:58 never had to nut up and own their own
15:01 business I mean I don't mean business
15:02 business but on their own life pay all
15:06 their bills they had no fallback it's
15:09 okay to have a fallback but it's like
15:10 use it when you're trying to do
15:12 something really innovative not just
15:13 because you're sitting there and you're
15:15 alive but now what do we consider
15:18 ourselves in the Great Awakening we
15:21 consider ourselves fairly I guess the
15:23 best way to say it is we are far more
15:25 enlightened we are a far more
15:28 enlightened version of ourselves than we
15:30 were before the awakening that's what
15:32 it's all about to be woke and now just
15:34 just to put a fine point on this I
15:37 noticed that the memes are going around
15:38 now trying to demonize and trivialize
15:42 being woke it's starting to become a
15:44 little bit of a dirty word like oh
15:46 you're one of those woke people who is
15:48 like oh what are you one of those
15:51 comatose people because yeah I'm locust
15:54 [ __ ] [ __ ] again they're channels
15:57 all over YouTube I see
15:59 dozens and dozens of them every single
16:00 day usually
16:02 that are trying to sugarcoat all this
16:04 stuff for the masses and I celebrate
16:06 them a thousand percent your pursuit of
16:08 truths your STG port reports your red
16:12 pill guy that 666 dude
16:16 he always has this chest exposed
16:18 although he's pretty he's pretty deep
16:20 thought II I think he keeps it pretty
16:22 raw but there's a lot of channels out
16:24 there trying to boil it all down those
16:25 swear words none of that stuff because
16:28 they really do want it to spread
16:29 downward and I think that that's
16:31 extremely important and vital I wouldn't
16:33 change a single hair on their head I
16:35 hope they keep doing it pursuit of truth
16:38 is probably one my favorites but the red
16:39 pill guys kind of grown on me as well
16:41 and the triple six guy he's just
16:44 straight-up brilliant he has earned
16:47 every single subscriber he has does the
16:50 late minute videos or just truth bombs
16:52 amazing I forget his whole name because
16:56 it's some bizarre handle just look for a
16:58 guy with long hair like me but it's
17:00 brown any worse round sunglasses and his
17:04 who's wearing a leather jacket with his
17:06 exposed chest between his jackets kind
17:09 of cool everyone's well aware shirt has
17:12 all kinds of weird symbolism in the
17:14 background but he's I think he's a good
17:15 dude and there's a ton more there's a
17:19 ton more I'm not mentioning so if I
17:20 didn't mention it doesn't mean I don't
17:21 love him what I consider this to be is
17:26 sort of one of those you know special
17:31 ops Navy SEAL Ranger Special Forces kind
17:39 of briefing rooms or even debriefing
17:42 room if you made it to this show and
17:44 you're still watching you've got scars
17:47 already you've been in these
17:48 conversations a thousand times with the
17:50 ton of people and you've won some and
17:54 you've lost some but you keep going
17:57 because it matters to you you either
18:01 have children and you're fighting for
18:02 their future perhaps you're young enough
18:04 to fight for your own future your
18:06 grandparent you had some grandkids
18:08 you're trying to fight for or you just
18:11 have a moral base and you want this
18:14 planet to have the best
18:15 - possibly can as a society one of those
18:19 painful things that happens to me on a
18:21 weekly basis I should say it's tuning
18:24 into old television and seeing how
18:28 wonderful the world was back in the day
18:30 especially that show What's My Line
18:32 amazing
18:34 this wasn't Leave It to Beaver where
18:35 people criticized it for being too
18:37 optimistic and too unrealistic it isn't
18:40 maybe a Twilight Zone it's so while
18:42 demented and twisted that people can't
18:44 take it seriously but a good what's my
18:47 line other shows but you have to
18:50 understand when you have these shows on
18:52 TV that have decent substance fantastic
18:56 actors fantastic scripts they really go
18:58 someplace sometimes and then the
19:00 audience has to watch it otherwise the
19:02 show goes off the air we were a better
19:05 place when I was a kid and that's just
19:07 the seventies man I've said it a hundred
19:10 times on this show you know fights when
19:13 I was a kid from even gang-on-gang just
19:16 watch the movie warriors released in
19:18 1979 I know I just went over this maybe
19:21 like 20 episodes ago but the idea is
19:23 that the gun in the movie was a big deal
19:26 the gang the Rogues had a gun and they
19:28 shot Cyrus at the beginning of the film
19:31 all the other gangs chasing the warriors
19:34 down from was at the Bronx to Coney
19:38 Island they just have fists baseball
19:42 bats I mean they're not there to murder
19:44 you they're there just to disable you
19:47 another world is kind of gone insane
19:50 murders in Chicago are just out of
19:52 control again it murders all through the
19:54 Midwest are just wild I mean la is a
19:57 tame beast compared to Chicago Brazil
20:01 and Venezuela oh my god they're just
20:03 murdering people because they they hit
20:05 20 I mean it's just unbelievable
20:07 and so we can see what a socialistic
20:11 country turns into we can see and you
20:16 know what you could even be saying well
20:17 hey look no socialism totally works on
20:19 paper yeah it does so does Marxism right
20:21 which is an advanced version of
20:22 communist acceleration allistic
20:23 governments
20:24 but the problem with socialism is that
20:28 it's immediately corruptible and
20:30 controllable that's why it sucks okay
20:33 and that's how Venezuela's upside down
20:35 with two liters and no one knows who the
20:37 hell is in charge because the second you
20:40 go to socialism is the second that the
20:41 banks can come down and buy one of these
20:43 guys off if not both of them or all
20:45 three of them or whatever Brazil was
20:49 ransacked by the IMF World Bank that
20:53 former president fifteen years ago
20:55 whatever he's gonna draw the oil off the
20:57 coast and turn it into an absolute
20:58 futuristic utopia that guy was kicked
21:01 out of office instantaneously well could
21:05 you imagine Donald Trump saying I'm
21:07 gonna drill a bunch of diamonds out of
21:09 the ground in order to sell them to the
21:10 world and and no one will have to pay
21:12 for college or health care we're gonna
21:14 have hovercrafts gonna tear up all the
21:16 highways cuz none will ever use them
21:17 anymore what a bullet trains everywhere
21:20 skyscrapers everywhere everything's
21:21 fantastic healthcare is amazing paid for
21:24 all the good stuff and then he's kicked
21:25 out of office and then within ten years
21:28 America is in the middle of basically
21:30 the walking dead because we're so upside
21:34 down that's what happened to Brazil no
21:37 one's paying attention no one's paying
21:40 attention and there's something very
21:43 bizarre about the bravado of South
21:45 America when it comes to killing
21:48 somebody a drug lords girl furniture
21:50 drug dealers hearing that man they just
21:53 murder you in two seconds and I mean
21:55 it's brutal the [ __ ] they do down there
21:58 well where is all that amazing muscle
22:01 and bravado when it comes to the country
22:04 the leadership of the country that leads
22:07 it into the Dark Ages and you really
22:09 want to know what the answer is
22:10 they have no [ __ ] clue how to run
22:12 their country no one in the country
22:14 knows how to run the country or at least
22:17 the professors that could maybe do a
22:19 fairly decent job don't have ms-13
22:21 working on their side to wipe out the
22:23 current government install them guess
22:26 once you put the once corruption
22:28 installs a new leader regardless if
22:31 they're corrupt or not it'll go corrupt
22:32 again it's a lack of education and
22:36 America is no different
22:38 the greatest appeal that America has to
22:41 Europe is sort of twofold one were
22:46 totally and completely addicted to
22:47 consumerism and so we move monetary
22:50 units around and what does that
22:52 facilitate well that allows those who
22:56 control it all the manufacturing of it
23:00 to be wealthy and in control
23:02 imagine we stopped using euros dollar
23:05 bills yen I forgot what the others are
23:09 called all the dinars and all these
23:12 other we just stopped using that we
23:13 start using something that they don't
23:15 control some digital currency they have
23:17 no control over whatsoever
23:19 well they'd be completely dissed
23:22 disbarred from from participating in the
23:27 overall direction of this planet but
23:32 like I said the you know towards the
23:33 beginning of this whole first season of
23:35 this show that's why it's imperative
23:38 that we figure out all of us how to run
23:41 a great country howdy had it not be
23:45 manipulated by issues so that we lose
23:49 our our way right now there was some I
23:54 forgot your name I really apologize one
23:56 of our listeners came onto the Facebook
23:58 group and she said could you please do
24:00 an episode about this whole abortion
24:02 thing I don't more oh my god you gotta
24:05 be kidding me win the abortion thing you
24:08 know I definitely have my opinion okay
24:10 it's been exaggerated up and synthesized
24:15 up and aggravated up to be a
24:17 presidential issue because they know
24:22 that Donald Trump is more of a pro-life
24:25 guy than a pro-abortion guy but he's
24:29 still he he just came out the other day
24:31 and had problems with this Alabama you
24:34 know zero abortion thing which actually
24:38 isn't true there's actually the one in
24:41 the Bala Bama you will not be charged if
24:43 you actually do it and I think that
24:45 there's a there are some loopholes that
24:48 you can get one so it's been greatly
24:51 exaggerated
24:52 but it's still there and then you have
24:53 13 liberal states saying kill a kid
24:55 who's nine months old Wow
24:59 unbelievable again if the Democrats were
25:03 in charge of the world there'd be no
25:05 more no more children would be born who
25:08 had a medical condition that was
25:12 diagnosed in the womb whether especially
25:14 not Down syndrome all the Down syndrome
25:16 kids could be completely wiped out could
25:18 be right I saw an article today by a
25:22 woman it's a very unique situation but
25:26 she said my mother was raped and that's
25:29 how I exist and she goes I'm really glad
25:32 that my mother went hadn't carried me
25:34 because I really enjoy my life when I
25:37 was in my church way back in the late
25:40 80s I was shocked at one of the very
25:43 first sessions I ever listened to in the
25:45 youth room the kids you know I'm like 19
25:49 no I'm 18 years old and this girl came
25:53 in and she said you know I have my son
25:56 who's out there in the daycare section
25:58 of the of the church it's like a
26:00 Wednesday night I think and she said I
26:03 was basically date raped that's how my
26:05 kid exists and you know I could see that
26:09 she was still traumatized thinking about
26:12 it and essentially was a former
26:13 boyfriend or maybe it was a boyfriend
26:16 excuse me that it was basically not
26:18 listening to her say I don't want to
26:19 have sex for the very first time in my
26:21 life right now in this car and he forced
26:24 himself on her I mean what kind of dude
26:26 can do that it's just nuts Ben you're
26:28 not looking at a guy that could perform
26:29 that but she kept her kid so I've seen
26:33 that happen too and again she knew who
26:37 this guy was I don't know about the
26:39 woman who did her own article about this
26:42 but there are definitely situations and
26:45 I'm really not trying to express my
26:47 opinion here but a complete stranger
26:49 pushing pushing himself on you has got
26:52 to be one of the most revolting things
26:55 possible and if you're now carrying the
26:57 child of a person who you would probably
27:00 stab through the head if you had a
27:01 chance
27:03 understand I do but today we have these
27:07 day-after pills right if you've had sex
27:10 and you know you didn't want to have sex
27:12 you can take this little pill and you
27:13 will not be pregnant and there most
27:16 likely will never be a heartbeat and
27:18 there most likely will never be a soul
27:20 attached to this piece of flesh on the
27:22 inner wall of your uterus it just won't
27:23 happen but I'm not you know completely
27:27 familiar with all the issues that people
27:29 are debating but you can't win with an
27:32 argument like that you can't if I took
27:33 any position whatsoever and I don't
27:37 really think a human being can
27:38 necessarily take a position you know I I
27:41 do not believe my only position is you
27:45 know kids passed it I have a friend of
27:48 mine okay I have a friend of mine who I
27:50 idolized he's one of the most
27:54 significant people in my life and I have
27:58 been idolizing this guy since I was 11
28:00 years old and actually was admiring his
28:03 things why I was nine years old didn't
28:05 even know it but he was born at six
28:08 months and so he is one of the most
28:11 amazing individuals I've ever met in my
28:13 entire life and he was born six months
28:17 old inst you know from his mother out
28:20 boom I don't believe his mother smoked
28:23 or drank or did anything it was a very
28:25 religious household it just happened and
28:29 he by all stretch of imagination and
28:33 measurement and quantifiable judgment
28:37 this man is an amazing man 100% what if
28:43 this whole thing were to be incubated up
28:47 not only legalized but encouraged we
28:51 would lose some amazing Souls I mean how
28:55 many how many times and I'll just end it
28:57 in this particular section on this
28:59 particular note how many times have we
29:01 had shows on TV both comedies and dramas
29:04 where you have a Down syndrome kid who's
29:08 mildly down so Germany's still there but
29:11 he is he or she is cute as a button
29:14 fully functional in society and you see
29:16 him all the time at depart
29:17 in stores you see them in fast-food
29:19 places from time to time they're fully
29:21 functional and they love their life
29:23 they've been given a purpose they're
29:24 damn good at it and just imagine all
29:27 these kids just disappearing because
29:29 there's this huge encouragement well you
29:31 know you got a you got the situation
29:33 might as well just you know get rid of
29:35 it and obviously some people would jump
29:39 at that and some people wouldn't I don't
29:42 think killing kids is a good way to be
29:46 promiscuous in life and what I find just
29:51 a complete contradiction in terms is
29:53 that you know this this whole idea that
29:57 you know life doesn't mean anything
30:00 anymore at all
30:02 right it you know it used to be the fat
30:04 child hit heir was starting to go
30:07 through the dilation of the canal that
30:12 kid at rights immediately now 13 states
30:15 now and they're trying to push it in all
30:16 the rest of the states right what the
30:20 hell 37 other states are trying to get
30:22 this whole thing to happen but now we
30:25 can have the situation where people
30:26 reach over the fence and they force your
30:28 child to be vaccinated whoa unreal
30:34 unreal now used to know the number on
30:39 this but I think we can have a fairly
30:42 decent discussion without the actual
30:43 statistics and some of you will know
30:45 this right off the bat but there was an
30:47 interesting metric I saw once probably
30:50 fifteen ten to fifteen years ago
30:52 that the number of people in any society
30:54 that actually participate in a war that
30:58 defends the people for being taken over
31:00 is actually very small it's not even
31:04 remotely the overwhelming majority of a
31:07 country and I believe one of the one of
31:12 the wars they were talking about was the
31:13 Revolutionary War and it was just so
31:15 small I couldn't wrap my riot mind
31:19 around I had to go look it up and the
31:21 numbers were really small and so we can
31:25 accomplish great things with just a few
31:27 warriors out there but now there is
31:31 a catch-22 with this formula the
31:36 depression did something very
31:37 interesting to the United States of
31:39 America when you compare it to a cause
31:41 like freedom this entire country was
31:48 other than you know a handful of
31:50 oligarchs and whatever rich people they
31:52 were talking about a fraction of a
31:54 single percent didn't feel problems from
31:58 1929 to basically 1945 some people
32:04 profit off war and all that stuff but
32:05 your average citizen you know we made
32:07 what was called depression where
32:09 depression where is all of the all of
32:12 the silverware at not civil were
32:14 necessarily but the the dishes and
32:15 pitchers and everything that used to
32:18 serve food was made of glass because we
32:20 could get a lot of glass and it was
32:21 fairly inexpensive and so to make it
32:23 more interesting
32:24 they made it ornate and beautiful I mean
32:27 my father has a collection that's
32:28 ridiculous I think he still has it so
32:32 one thing I want from him for sure but
32:35 I've told you countless stories about my
32:37 grandmother who was affected by it and
32:39 guys I was buying clothes from and all
32:41 that kind of stuff my point for bringing
32:43 that up right now is that when everyone
32:45 suffered everyone was excited in 1946
32:50 and 47 and 48 and that's why the baby
32:52 boomer generation occurred it was a
32:55 wonderful wonderful time after this war
32:57 world war was over and by the way a
33:00 friend of mine reminded me that America
33:02 didn't really go into battle in Europe
33:06 until 1944 it was very interesting we
33:09 were massing our troops over there
33:11 similar to what war won but we made it
33:15 for it after that of course but now when
33:20 you have a bunch of people fighting for
33:22 the majority what ends up happening you
33:25 have a bunch of lazy entitled
33:27 piece-of-shit people that just think
33:32 everything's supposed to be given to
33:33 them they deserve things elective things
33:39 kids that deserve thousand-dollar phones
33:43 I mean the PlayStation only costs what
33:45 399 right now probably $2.99 half the
33:48 half the places out there where the new
33:50 ones gonna come out it's gonna be $5.99
33:52 and your kid deserves it and the games
33:54 are 80 to 100 bucks and your kid
33:56 deserves it
33:57 now there are situations where children
34:00 can earn things they get great grades
34:02 they remain decent human beings and you
34:04 can say each time you give them
34:07 something you say this is because you
34:10 did that and you've maintained your
34:12 integrity and you're not off doing this
34:15 and I know that even though today you've
34:17 made it to this point you need to
34:18 understand the temptations are gonna
34:19 continue coming at you and quite frankly
34:22 it might even get stronger and stronger
34:25 and more and more difficult to resist
34:27 but the more you resist the more that
34:28 these kind of things the elective things
34:31 in your life can always be there so we
34:36 have that sort of foundation where these
34:41 kids are getting you know entitled to
34:44 make matters worse they're being taken
34:48 advantage of the being taken advantage
34:52 of from a political standpoint being
34:54 taught to believe in things that don't
34:57 work out don't study history believe in
35:00 socialism those have to go hand it in
35:03 you have to be a complete historical
35:05 [ __ ] to believe in socialism you just
35:08 have to be Bernie Sanders just you know
35:11 he just gave a speech and was talking
35:12 about Denmark Denmark Denmark and hell
35:14 what a great utopian socialism it is and
35:17 then this gentleman from Denmark did a
35:21 beautiful breakdown with these crazy
35:23 beautiful animations just slowly taking
35:26 apart Bernie Sanders entire argument
35:30 that Denmark is the socialistic country
35:33 that he says it is he says look we were
35:35 actually pulling out of this model
35:36 because it didn't work but we were smart
35:39 enough and had a small enough population
35:41 that we were able to adjust and pull out
35:43 of it because it wasn't working and
35:46 national health care was one of the
35:49 biggest things that didn't work and
35:51 everyone's going back to private
35:52 insurance now
35:54 one of the most interesting things that
35:56 we don't do in the United States which
35:59 I'm almost I'm almost in favor of it I
36:04 don't know exactly what I'm talking
36:06 about because we haven't done it but up
36:09 until the age of 18 I had dual
36:10 citizenship with Germany and America
36:14 because I was born in Germany which is
36:18 cool cuz three and a 3/4 of my bloodline
36:20 comes from over there so that works out
36:22 great and the one for that we don't know
36:23 we're not quite sure where the hell that
36:24 guy comes from he came over here from a
36:28 ship from England but he we can't find
36:32 any British people look like us so we're
36:34 still trying to figure that out but they
36:37 said that if I needed to keep if I
36:39 wanted to keep my German citizenship
36:41 that I would have to fly to Germany and
36:44 enter their military for at least I
36:48 think one year I'd have to go through
36:49 their basic training and then just do
36:52 whatever they told me to do for one year
36:54 and you know it was a fairly peaceful
36:57 time in 1987 so I wouldn't have been the
36:58 end of the world you know it would have
37:00 been falling into some war or something
37:02 but that's that's what was required of
37:05 me and I thought that sucks because I
37:08 really dug the dual citizenship idea now
37:13 maybe that's not true but that's what I
37:15 was told and I've heard it from other
37:16 people but now in America we don't do it
37:20 but a ton of countries do they force you
37:23 to go through one year of military
37:24 training now let me make a distinction
37:27 here I don't think the kids should be
37:31 indoctrinated to lust for war by any
37:34 stretch but I mean your average video
37:36 game does so I think a video game played
37:39 for five to ten to fifteen to twenty
37:41 years does a hell of a lot more to make
37:43 a kid lust for war than going to basic
37:45 training well basic training has done
37:49 for people that I know personally
37:50 because my own why you know I lived on
37:52 bases from time to time and if I didn't
37:56 live in it I lived next to one and we
37:58 always shopped at one and I had to clean
37:59 out barracks as a kid you know and my
38:01 father was in the military so I was very
38:03 very engrossed in military life until I
38:06 was probably about thirteen
38:07 years old but then even after that's my
38:11 father's a very proud soldier so but it
38:15 gives people structure it gives the
38:18 people a sense of orientation where are
38:21 you well you're in America well what
38:24 does that mean well for your average kid
38:27 in the city you'd say Los Angeles they
38:29 may never know they may never leave Los
38:32 Angeles they may never leave California
38:33 I mean that sounds nuts but it's
38:35 definitely the truth I know people in my
38:39 hometown hell I got a relative who's
38:41 traveled only out of the Central States
38:44 from say Kansas Oklahoma and Texas he's
38:50 only been out of those three states
38:51 maybe three or four times his entire
38:54 life and it's only for like a week or
38:56 day or something he's back knows nothing
38:59 about the world nothing unless he's
39:02 changed dramatically but there was
39:05 something about this guy that came into
39:08 the lounge that I think is very
39:09 interesting what he had done is build a
39:13 little comfort zone around himself such
39:16 that he when he looks through his
39:19 reality distortion field at the world he
39:21 always sees either some futile algorithm
39:26 of well there's no point in me trying to
39:28 do anything different or it's roses or
39:32 bowl of cherries out there it's not it's
39:38 so none I've had some conversations with
39:42 friends of mine recently and some new
39:45 acquaintances of mine who have spent
39:47 years and years living in other
39:49 countries traveling the world and one of
39:52 them said to me recently America's the
39:58 freest most amazing place in the entire
40:01 world but we are told exactly the
40:03 opposite and the countries outside this
40:05 world are told the exact opposite as
40:08 well they are told that we are living in
40:10 a cage of our you know whatever and they
40:13 live in the freest place on planet earth
40:17 now part of that might sound
40:19 nationalistic right I
40:21 would say that would be a very
40:22 nationalistic thing to say for a person
40:24 who would believe that having ever
40:26 traveled out and never having lived a
40:28 year here a year there working with the
40:31 people and these different locations and
40:33 finding out how much tyranny is still
40:36 alive
40:37 how much communism is still alive how
40:40 much socialistic tyranny is still out
40:43 there now I've told you guys in videos
40:48 that may or may not be out at this point
40:49 I probably have God like five or six in
40:52 the queue right now that I will force
40:56 myself up to a point to kind of keep
41:02 tabs on how Brazil is doing how
41:06 Argentina is doing how Venezuela is
41:10 doing how Mexico is doing they're my
41:14 neighbors to the south and everyone I
41:17 meet from that those countries that come
41:19 here are usually the nicest people on
41:22 planet earth and so when I see that the
41:26 utter chaos down there the violence and
41:29 the death it frustrates me it breaks my
41:32 heart that these people will have to
41:34 leave their indigenous country to come
41:35 here and boy very happy to be here they
41:41 don't have to look over their shoulders
41:42 because their local police department
41:44 will snatch them and hold them at ransom
41:46 until their family pays whatever those
41:49 people think they have in the bank
41:51 I have friends of mine that go south the
41:53 border all the time and they have a full
41:57 strategy about what roads to take what
41:59 roads not to take they keep things in
42:01 their cars they can bribe these guys
42:02 with they get pulled over I had a friend
42:06 of mine recently go down there she went
42:09 two hours below the border and I was
42:12 very interested in her opinion because I
42:14 don't think she'd ever been down there
42:15 besides flying way down there and never
42:18 really seeing you know the indigenous
42:20 life and she said you know it's nuts you
42:25 go into the stone Age's down there she
42:27 goes there's no paved roads where we
42:28 were and she said you know it's just
42:30 huts and sewage is every
42:34 we're and it's like these people don't
42:35 seem to know that that's what they live
42:36 in okay it's not like someone has lived
42:42 like we do but when I look at the pain
42:45 and suffering that comes from these
42:47 nations that that attack their own
42:48 people the people attack their own
42:50 people with the cops I attacked her own
42:51 people politicians are as corrupt as
42:54 they could possibly get get you know
42:55 most the politicians can't get elected
42:58 unless they have very close
43:00 relationships with drug lords to ensure
43:02 that the drug loads will be able to do
43:03 what they want to do and no one's ever
43:05 gonna stop them you know most people
43:09 just want to make a ton of money that's
43:11 all they want to do whether they sell
43:12 something illegal or legal they don't
43:14 really care but no one's ever brought
43:18 them something'll it's legit that makes
43:21 up for this super easy thing called
43:24 cocaine you know I'm always talking on
43:27 the show about how you know I'm very
43:29 careful about getting in anyone's face
43:33 cuz I usually don't in fact the last
43:36 couple times that I've ever gotten into
43:38 someone's face one of them was probably
43:40 ten years ago almost probably to the
43:44 year and the other one was this guy
43:46 which was pretty soft handed a couple
43:49 days ago but I was just sick and tired
43:52 of I was like look this guy's done with
43:53 his stick he's just sitting there and if
43:56 he Pitt gets up and leaves and never
43:57 comes back oh my god it couldn't come
43:59 too soon you know sort of the opinion I
44:01 was in within the moment but I was
44:06 letting this guy have it and I was being
44:07 funny at the same time so the room was
44:09 kind of laughing at the same time and
44:11 he's trying to backtrack out of it but
44:14 he ended up getting extremely defensive
44:16 he did actually leave sort of angry but
44:17 he was also sort of falling asleep in
44:19 his chair because I got really late like
44:22 we went to about 2:00 a.m. but the other
44:25 one is the story I told many many years
44:26 ago which I was sitting at a restaurant
44:29 and it was the news it was on it was
44:34 something about one of these great Nobel
44:39 Peace Prize Obama wars that were going
44:41 on in the Middle East and this old
44:43 Italian guy was at the end of this bar
44:47 and he was rattling off about how we
44:49 should go over there and just kick their
44:51 ass kick their ass kicked their ass and
44:52 it was some bizarre area of the world
44:54 that we shouldn't be in the first place
44:56 and I just looked at the guy I said I
44:58 said you know were you ever in the
45:01 military no well then how can you sit
45:04 there and just throw our young people
45:07 like bodies on a fire how can you just
45:09 sit there and do that and then do you
45:11 speak the language over there do you
45:12 even know what the issues are no no no
45:14 no no and I leaned into him for just
45:17 like ten seconds of talking and the room
45:21 kind of would quiet a little bit and
45:23 then about an hour later the guy came up
45:26 to me and he said you know I'm really
45:28 sorry because you're right
45:29 I was knee jerking my response and I
45:33 should have thought thought it through
45:34 because I'm not really thinking about
45:35 the human life that I am just throwing
45:37 around to solve this problem now I made
45:43 a commitment to myself not to do it like
45:44 that ever again but it worked in that
45:47 moment sometimes you just got to be in
45:49 the moment you know what's interesting
45:52 is is I've seen some pretty frivolous
45:54 class-action lawsuits in my lifetime
45:57 I've seen some stupid lawsuits where
46:00 people made millions and millions of
46:01 dollars for just having no common sense
46:03 whatsoever
46:04 and what I think is fascinating about
46:07 that is that you know first of all when
46:09 you hear a lawsuit go through and this
46:12 ridiculous circumstance you know someone
46:15 makes like what was it and I don't mean
46:18 to belittle this is one that comes to
46:20 mind wroth about what there was the
46:21 famous McDonald's hot coffee thing that
46:23 someone was given hot coffee no it was
46:26 obviously way too goddamn hot and it
46:28 spilled on them in their car I think and
46:31 burn them probably first degree
46:34 I don't think hot coffee could get
46:35 anything over first degree but obviously
46:38 cause some in bodily injury and the
46:39 person definitely deserves some
46:41 compensation but the compensation was
46:43 off the charts you know it was a
46:46 seven-digit compensation if not higher
46:49 and this is like in the 80s or something
46:52 right and you're thinking now wait a
46:54 minute my buddy had you know the tip of
46:57 his thumb cut off in a
47:00 in a cardboard compressor in a warehouse
47:04 in the attorneys told him well the
47:07 highest that anyone's ever made for this
47:08 kind of injury when another guy yanked
47:11 the thing down on his finger without
47:12 checking to see if people were clear of
47:14 it it was $15,000 he lost a quarter of
47:19 an inch off his thumb and he tried to
47:22 fight it for more and end up getting
47:24 less he end up getting less than $10,000
47:27 for losing a quarter of his thump and
47:29 this person has a temporary burn that's
47:31 gonna heal up just fine
47:32 and gets like a million dollars three
47:34 million dollars so goddamn crazy amount
47:36 of money and why am I talking about this
47:38 all of a sudden because as I look at all
47:43 these poor kids these Millennials that
47:45 have got these degrees that are
47:46 absolutely unemployable and a bunch of
47:48 them Gen Xers are John's ears going in
47:51 to get another round of this [ __ ] they
47:54 should get together and sue the living
47:56 crap out of these colleges and all they
48:00 need to sue for there's two things one
48:03 you're gonna absolve my debt completely
48:08 two you're gonna pay for my college
48:12 somewhere else not your shitty school
48:15 but somewhere else where I can get a
48:17 degree that actually has a job attached
48:19 to it a trade skill perhaps if someone
48:24 can make a million dollars off of hot
48:26 coffee
48:27 then by God every one of these kids
48:30 should go through McDonald's
48:30 drive-throughs and spilled coffee on
48:32 themselves pocket nine hundred grand and
48:35 go get a great college education take
48:37 five hundred go to Harvard but these
48:40 schools should be on the hook for
48:42 re-educating kids if nothing else at a
48:46 bare minimum they should have to
48:47 re-educate the kids into better degrees
48:49 for free with some subsidies so they can
48:52 pay their bills while they're going to
48:53 school what came up a couple days ago
48:57 with this conversation with his dude and
48:59 it was around him because he didn't have
49:01 any information about it he kind of
49:02 agreed with it and we moved on but the
49:05 whole thing about the VA hospital the
49:07 Veterans Association I guess that's what
49:09 that stands for
49:11 you know our soldiers go and fight war
49:13 so that bankers can make its [ __ ] ton of
49:15 money but the second the soldier gets
49:16 back they don't have anything to do with
49:18 their bodily injuries these poor
49:24 soldiers were having to drive before
49:25 Trump got into office soldiers were
49:28 having to drive eight hours to twelve
49:31 hours in one direction because their
49:33 referral wouldn't allow them to go
49:35 anywhere else anywhere near where they
49:38 actually live I mean you know Obama said
49:41 oh you can keep your doctor you can keep
49:42 your plann also their horse [ __ ] [ __ ]
49:44 lie lie lie lie lie the fact that anyone
49:47 can support that piece of [ __ ] human
49:49 being is beyond me
49:50 Trump comes in boom VA is taken care of
49:54 these guys can go now right in their
49:56 backyard that's progress but why do we
50:02 have to elect Trump to get something
50:04 like that to happen who are we what are
50:07 we a bunch of peons we can't make
50:10 demands this is our country
50:13 it ain't Pelosi's country it ain't
50:15 Schumer's country it ain't shifts
50:17 country Comey Brannon all these scumbags
50:20 it's not their country it's ours
50:23 but we're funding apparatus where they
50:27 can actually spy on us illegally to then
50:32 frame us for anything that they want to
50:35 to distract the people from and they're
50:38 good at it they're really good at it
50:40 aren't they if something were to happen
50:43 to the world let's just say the Day the
50:46 Earth Stood Still kind of thing well
50:47 let's just say human beings lost power
50:53 this is this is huge right everybody
50:55 knows why don't you do a little bit of
50:56 math on this it's it's sort of
50:59 disturbing how bad the outcome would be
51:02 but if the United States of America or
51:06 the whole world some coronal mass
51:08 ejection some F F that might happen and
51:13 they killed the power for one year hell
51:18 even a month it would be so massive the
51:23 loss
51:24 the death and the suffering if we lost
51:27 power that as soon as we got power back
51:30 we would understand how valuable
51:34 electricity is and we would take
51:37 measures to ensure that all power is
51:41 protected that all power is SuperDuper
51:44 redundant that nothing can threaten
51:47 power you know as long as there's a
51:50 waterfall out there there should always
51:52 be power you can't stop water from
51:55 falling unless you ice the whole place
51:57 down or you cut off the water supply but
52:00 a water turbine situation what we
52:02 haven't made any of those since 1973
52:04 America banned it because the oil
52:07 industry in the electrical electrical
52:09 industry said no no that stuff's really
52:12 cheap and we got to charge a ton of
52:14 money for power like I said in my energy
52:16 episode raise your hand if you chose
52:19 gasoline raise your hand if you chose
52:21 electricity made by whatever technique
52:24 nuclear power plants raise your hand if
52:26 you were the person that said oh I got
52:27 all these other opportunities to do
52:29 geothermal plants and zero-point energy
52:31 systems but I choose this you this
52:34 monetary unit system or they can sell me
52:38 a unit of power gallon of gas none of us
52:43 chose that [ __ ] people the [ __ ]
52:46 JPMorgan people the Rockefellers the
52:49 Rothschilds the Hapsburgs the Pacers the
52:52 Windsors all these people they chose
52:55 that stuff for us so that we would be
52:57 repressed by its very existence you know
53:01 I didn't know this but this has come up
53:02 twice in like three days
53:05 where I heard from something online and
53:07 then I heard it from a friend of mine
53:09 it's illegal to surcharge or to sorry
53:14 it's illegal to raise the price of milk
53:17 in the United States of America I don't
53:21 know if that's the case in other
53:22 countries I hope it is but because it's
53:25 a strategic resource of health in this
53:27 country again I don't know a ton of
53:29 people that drink a lot of milk but it
53:31 is so they protected anything it becomes
53:34 a strategic resource of mankind becomes
53:36 a regulated
53:38 commodity well wouldn't you say gasoline
53:41 is pretty regular pretty strategic to
53:44 the existence of all countries at least
53:46 all first world countries hell yeah it
53:48 is but it ain't regulated go buy a
53:52 gallon of gas in Santa Monica
53:54 it's nearly five bucks right now hmm you
53:59 know their excuses for raising the price
54:01 of gas it's all [ __ ] it's all
54:04 [ __ ] it's all supply and demand and
54:06 more people travel in summer time so the
54:08 gal just what we're all driving around
54:09 when it's cold and rainy they just bring
54:12 down the price because no one's
54:13 traveling anywhere why do it electricity
54:17 water trash food of a certain level
54:23 right so all strategic resources for
54:26 Humanity belk food you know but we're
54:32 all pretending to be morons so that we
54:35 never wake up in the morning and have to
54:37 do anything with our life now some
54:41 people worry about online and I think
54:44 it's a non-issue it's a non-issue at
54:47 it's very core but there was an era
54:50 there for a little while
54:52 where we had some people you know kind
54:54 of going nuts and and making videos
54:58 online threatening this safety the
55:00 literally physical safety of people hey
55:04 there's definitely a handful of people
55:05 that if they met their end in the near
55:09 future you're you know some champagne
55:11 would probably sell off the shelves but
55:14 you know people would worry about you
55:17 know expressing an opinion against the
55:19 particular individual because they don't
55:20 want someone to hear what they say and
55:22 then there to be some sort of violent
55:24 action towards another human being you
55:27 know what the best thing we can do is
55:29 just help ourselves and help each other
55:31 and these people that love control and
55:35 measure themselves by how much they
55:36 control us they will simply suffer sort
55:40 of a human jail wherever they are
55:43 because they've lost all their power all
55:45 their influence and their name will be
55:48 dragged through the mud
55:51 was that that documentary on Netflix
55:53 which is the was that the relatives of
55:57 the the Hitler family it was a
56:01 fascinating thing I guess it was you
56:04 know technically speaking you know until
56:06 you start researching Hitler escaping to
56:08 Argentina and living into the early 60s
56:10 with Ava you're dying in the late 60s
56:14 it's pretty much confirmed at this point
56:17 for some of you don't know that go to
56:19 your research before you start yelling
56:20 at the screen but anyway there's
56:23 relatives and you know it's hard it's
56:25 hard having that last name well there's
56:28 a bunch of last names that are gonna
56:29 have a really tough time if we can ever
56:31 well if we can just continue the Great
56:34 Awakening this is freedom Renaissance
56:36 2.0 but there's always somebody want to
56:40 mess with it right
56:41 always always always and that's why you
56:44 have to put things in place to catch
56:47 crimes crimes of control you know I had
56:53 probably I think I told the story at
56:55 least once before the guide the last
56:57 years ago was again coming up with all
57:00 these sort of you know capitulating
57:03 serfdom slavery platitudes of why
57:07 nothing will change it's all the same
57:09 way Dada da Dada knew nothing about any
57:13 of the movements in the world that are
57:15 poised to really change things he hadn't
57:18 heard of the yellow vests and the yellow
57:19 vests are now in their six month in
57:21 Paris trying to trying to change from
57:25 this horrible sort of globalist
57:28 socialist world where they they make
57:30 eleven hundred euros a month on average
57:32 but the average one-bedroom apartment in
57:34 France in Paris France is nine hundred
57:36 euros a month just and their money gets
57:40 taxed fifty percent so it's like I don't
57:43 even know how these people survive over
57:44 there I don't but just prior to Trump
57:47 getting elected there was a guy in there
57:50 I believe is an attorney by trade I
57:54 don't see him very often he comes about
57:56 once a year but for this particular
57:57 stretch he was coming in he was here for
58:00 about three weeks the keys from
58:02 upstate New York where he comes and
58:04 immediately comes to the lounge a very
58:07 nice man but he had all these sayings
58:10 about how Hillary was going to throw the
58:12 election and we all had that instinct we
58:14 all knew that she was part of the deef
58:15 state and the bilderbergs had chosen her
58:18 and she was that she was the one's gonna
58:21 make it when we watched everyone ball
58:22 their brains out on the news for God's
58:24 sakes even Fox was shocked that she
58:26 didn't win when they're supposed to be
58:28 supporting Trump because there's such a
58:30 right-wing organization right but I laid
58:34 into this guy a little bit and I said
58:35 look you're just giving up on everything
58:38 I said so I told the guy said are you
58:40 gonna come in here after Trump wins and
58:43 take all this crap back all this
58:46 capitulating give up you know post-fight
58:50 approach and this guy's probably in his
58:52 mid-50s and there's just that generation
58:56 I don't know if it's just a baby boomer
58:57 thing or what it is but they've been so
59:01 conditioned to give up it's nauseating
59:04 and I don't know about you but I'm I'm
59:09 done I'm done hearing that crap from
59:11 people you know a young person I'm not
59:13 talking about that a really really old
59:15 person I don't you know they have their
59:18 ways and you know they're not in the
59:20 game doesn't matter a child will
59:23 hopefully get in the game at some point
59:24 but hopefully a child will inherit a
59:25 great world but what if the Great
59:28 Awakening completely succeeds and and
59:30 all my objective is on this show
59:32 completely meet their fruition and all
59:35 of you guys and gals work together with
59:37 each other and whatever whatever
59:39 resources you have in this world turns
59:41 out to be a great place how do we keep
59:43 our kids understanding what we did it's
59:48 super difficult I think the the one
59:53 gigantic mistake that America made the
59:55 mess up the whole [ __ ] place is to
59:59 spoil their kids that's what I heard
60:01 when I was a kid well I wanted to give
60:03 my kids everything I didn't have don't
60:06 do that now if we're talking about your
60:10 parents beat you yeah
60:12 don't beat your kids you know that's
60:13 that's a pretty good
60:14 start but binding them a bunch of [ __ ]
60:16 because you report but Donald Trump put
60:19 all of his kids on a $500 per diem
60:21 credit card a month when they went to
60:24 college if they wanted any other money
60:26 they had to go work for it there's a lot
60:29 of people running for president in 2020
60:31 in America whose kids are gigantic
60:34 pieces of [ __ ]
60:36 criminals they have charges on them that
60:41 would shock you if they ever came on
60:43 your kids but these kids potentially if
60:45 we don't nut up and fix this place their
60:49 kids are gonna go scot-free because
60:51 they're related to somebody who was in
60:53 office well you've seen it our whole
60:56 life separately but one of the
60:59 candidates running for office who's a
61:00 pedophile his son was caught with a
61:06 crack pipe and some drugs and all those
61:09 other [ __ ] and the police had the police
61:12 just simply said they're not gonna press
61:14 charges found some loophole some reason
61:18 in the books because his father was in
61:22 the White House hmm wouldn't you love
61:25 that wouldn't you love your kids who
61:28 just totally get off scot-free you know
61:31 my family we had one guy that committed
61:35 he's a teenager he was a minor and with
61:38 one of his other teenage friends he was
61:41 this is back in the 60s and by the 60s
61:44 early 60s and he had done some petty
61:45 crimes and at one point they attempted
61:51 to steal a safe out of this I think it
61:54 was a gas station or something and they
61:56 put it in the back of their truck how
61:57 they even got in the back of this car
61:59 door no it's little the 50s car right if
62:01 even that's maybe he's a 40s car so it
62:03 was really rugged big car but this safe
62:06 is weighing like you know I don't know
62:07 500 600 pounds and so this cars they
62:10 can't close the trunk lid and the cars
62:12 like all sunk down to the ground and
62:14 they're just driving down the street
62:15 with this thing and the cops are like oh
62:17 that's weird two teenage boys and
62:19 there's a safe in the back of this car
62:21 we can see it and so they went and uh
62:24 they flipped on their lights they went
62:26 to high pursuit
62:27 chase and so when it came time to go to
62:32 jail to go to juvie all one kid did go
62:36 to juvie Oh for a very short period time
62:38 ended up being an excellent individual
62:40 he built a wonderful family what I'm
62:44 that guy end up being my karate teacher
62:46 at one point it was kind of funny good
62:48 guy soft beautiful soul
62:51 but my relative who was with this guy
62:55 his father went to the judge and simply
62:58 said what are you thinking because I'm
63:03 gonna kick my kids ass probably a lot
63:06 worse than you will if you just release
63:07 him to me and judges like what are you
63:11 thinking man because I'm just gonna send
63:13 him to juvie old he'll be out in like a
63:14 few months and uh and he said my
63:17 relatives said from what I understand he
63:20 said that's just gonna make him more of
63:22 a criminal I'm gonna straighten this kid
63:25 out and so he he released him to my
63:32 relative and my relative gave his son a
63:37 ticket a bus ticket and a little bit of
63:41 money and said you're gonna go to the
63:42 East Coast I think it was like a New
63:45 York or something like that but he got
63:46 on a boat and he said you're not to come
63:49 back until you go around the world and
63:51 I'll cover your bus ticket when you land
63:55 in San Diego wherever the hell was or
63:57 San Francisco and you're gonna be able
63:58 to take a bus back home and so he ended
64:03 up being a ship's mate on this boat that
64:08 went around the world and I don't know
64:10 how he pulled this off but he went all
64:11 around the world ended up stopping in
64:14 Europe he's got no money he gave was
64:17 given no additional money so he had to
64:19 do all this by himself well the kid was
64:22 a really smart guy and he was sort of
64:24 bored with life which is why he was
64:25 doing these crimes in the first place
64:28 but the kid turned out to be an uber
64:31 uber genius his kids are geniuses
64:37 he ended up speaking fluent German in
64:40 technical German I know speaking fluent
64:43 Japanese and technical Japanese which I
64:45 mean scientific Japanese so how to be a
64:48 chemist in both America Germany and
64:51 Japan and he's the one that ended up
64:54 running one of the largest
64:55 pharmaceutical companies for 20 years
64:57 but had he not had his ass kicked and
65:00 thrown around the world to get his [ __ ]
65:04 together to suffer and to see what the
65:08 world was all about and to see how
65:09 privileged he was and how much freedom
65:12 he was going to be given up if he were
65:13 to continue down the line of being a
65:15 juvenile criminal and then a real
65:16 criminal as he got older I don't know
65:19 what he would have turned out to be I
65:21 don't know he's a smart guy but maybe he
65:24 would have been like one of my best
65:25 friends in high school who was also
65:26 probably one of the smartest kids in the
65:28 entire school if not the smartest kid in
65:31 my class who ended up getting shot and
65:34 killed by a drug dealer because he was
65:37 so smart he turned to crime to keep
65:39 himself entertained and after school was
65:42 over I guess he got involved with
65:45 running drugs and eventually some would
65:46 caught up with them and killed him a
65:49 very close friend of mine very sad
65:52 situation everybody thought this kid
65:56 would just go off to be something
65:57 massive
65:58 you know nope died so here's my advice
66:05 and my hope for everybody who can hear
66:09 my voice at the end of this episode
66:10 because if you made it this far you're
66:12 exactly the candidate to listen to this
66:15 this notion there is something you can
66:22 get involved in I don't know what it is
66:25 if nothing else you might view some of
66:29 this more political stuff and boil it
66:31 down for people that you know you know
66:34 how to communicate with but you know
66:35 they would never watch the sources that
66:36 you watch to understand what's going on
66:39 in the world
66:40 I have friends of mine that campaign
66:42 against chemtrails exclusively and
66:45 they've done the kind of interviews I've
66:47 done with pilots and they found out this
66:49 stuff is extremely
66:51 you may be someone who's about
66:53 anti-cancer things you might be about
66:55 the cure to cancers you might be someone
66:58 who gets on the bandwagon of Education
67:03 whatever it is do you have something you
67:08 can champion and something that you're
67:10 really well-equipped to champion because
67:12 of who you are as a person I don't know
67:14 what that is and really no one should
67:16 tell you what to do you should find it
67:18 for yourself
67:19 and find out where your passions are and
67:21 go for it there's plenty of agendas out
67:25 there look at Candice Owens you know I
67:30 was talking to a another female friend
67:33 of mine I was talking about Candice
67:34 because it dawned on me a few weeks ago
67:37 that I don't think she's old enough to
67:40 run for president yet because I think
67:42 she's under 36 but if she ever gets to
67:45 that age and runs for president I don't
67:50 know what she's gonna do with her life
67:51 personally and I have no idea if she
67:53 would ever do such a thing but if she
67:54 ever did I would be more excited about a
67:58 presidential candidate than I have ever
68:00 been in my lifetime now what we haven't
68:06 seen and what always concerns me and I
68:08 do apologize ladies and I would be
68:11 interested in your opinion actually on
68:12 this one if there's female prime
68:16 ministers of fimo Chancellor's female
68:18 presidents all around the world but
68:21 being the president of the United States
68:22 of America is I think more daunting than
68:25 being the president of any other country
68:27 on this entire planet because of our
68:29 military strength because of everything
68:31 were involved in especially the probably
68:34 the crimes that were involved in at this
68:36 point that are being exposed but perhaps
68:37 by the time someone like Candice would
68:39 run for president maybe we we have
68:43 several wins in a row we have several
68:44 real presidents that don't go to
68:46 Bohemian Grove and the Bohemian are
68:48 though in the Bilderberg Group and
68:50 they're not member of the CFR the
68:51 trilateral commission or any that stuff
68:54 but I like her style I like the fact
68:56 that she can see more than most people
68:58 in this world she's more she sees more
69:01 than I see that's for damn sure
69:02 but we know that the world
69:04 fairly chauvinistic place right we know
69:07 that's the truth
69:08 and so when it comes to Foreign Affairs
69:11 this is my question for you ladies and
69:13 anyone else just has an opinion of
69:14 course when it comes to foreign affairs
69:17 and having to deal with and I don't mean
69:20 to cast any dispersions on this example
69:23 but let's say Vladimir Putin the dude
69:27 gets elected every single year he's been
69:29 in office since 2000 January 1st so he's
69:34 been in there 19 years I don't know how
69:36 much further he can go but he looks
69:38 pretty healthy to me doesn't he look
69:39 pretty healthy to you I think he likes
69:41 his job and I think he feels like if he
69:42 leaves his position his country might
69:45 suffer immediately he can go backwards I
69:47 don't know I don't know what this guy's
69:48 opinion is we have a dude in Venezuela
69:54 was it Maduro he's a big guy right so it
69:57 was six foot eight some big giant dude I
70:00 don't know I actually don't know how
70:01 tall he is but by god he looks like a
70:02 freakin gorked walking around with his
70:06 other people he's a big guy I don't know
70:10 if they would I mean they're be
70:12 obviously some people that would have an
70:15 amazing of an immediate excuse me
70:17 disrespect for a female some would
70:21 probably try to woo a female and try to
70:24 play all their man tricks on a woman but
70:28 I think that someone like Hanna's owns
70:29 would see obviously right through either
70:31 tactic and be strong be a super strong
70:34 she's super strong female I love her to
70:36 death now she could change her position
70:39 and we could disagree in two years but I
70:42 don't really think that's gonna take
70:43 place but she's an example in my opinion
70:48 she's like a perfect archetype of a
70:50 female for me she has her own causes and
70:54 she's intimately familiar with the
70:57 causes that she's involved in and when
71:00 she speaks you just stop and listen man
71:02 it's just beautiful she's the antithesis
71:05 of Cortes who you hope you never hear
71:09 talk ever again Cortes didn't know what
71:13 a garbage disposal was can you believe
71:16 that
71:17 she did a video where she videotaped a
71:19 garbage disposal and was trying to say
71:21 I'm a guide like I don't even know like
71:23 what this thing is and like I've never
71:25 had one where ever I've lived before in
71:27 your life you don't know what a garbage
71:29 disposal is your your how old are you
71:32 and you've never had a conversation
71:33 about one you never been to your
71:35 friend's house you never saw your
71:36 friend's mother grind something up in
71:37 one of them
71:38 really she's supposed only you know
71:41 again graduates top in her class
71:44 everywhere that scandal of people buying
71:46 degrees I think is aimed at her but when
71:50 I see like you know there's definitely a
71:52 big thing going on in the world right
71:54 now with the big girl power movement
71:56 that's going on right now it's been
71:57 going on for probably about ten years
71:58 right where you've got these you know
72:01 superheroes of all these movies or
72:02 females and to a point it's great you
72:06 know you got Wonder Woman no one wonders
72:08 if if that's real power but then you
72:11 have things like Game of Thrones with
72:13 these like 110 pound girls knocking out
72:16 you know six foot eight guys and it
72:18 concerns me as a father that I would
72:20 have you know four daughters and they
72:22 would watch these shows and this is
72:25 where you see all those videos online
72:26 where these girls are out in front of
72:28 nightclubs and they're at Denny's in the
72:30 middle of the night and they're talking
72:32 really you know disrespectful to another
72:34 maybe they've been disrespect I don't
72:36 know but they're picking fights with
72:37 grown men and then they're getting
72:38 knocked out and you know then Game of
72:41 Thrones all of a sudden is like what why
72:43 you know those girls were able to to you
72:46 know stab a hole you know like one girl
72:48 is able to kill a hundred guys in some
72:49 battle and it's like you don't have a
72:52 dragon to write on okay
72:54 you're just a mortal human being and you
72:56 need to respect what you're capable of
72:57 doing so take the brain power I mean
72:59 there's women that can knock a guy
73:00 completely out don't get me wrong but
73:03 confrontation is sort of a last resort
73:05 for any modern civilization right so
73:09 this is what I love about a Candace
73:10 Owens because if her brain was turned
73:13 into a robot that could fight I don't
73:17 know it was that giant robot man I mean
73:18 that thing would be Decepticon I mean
73:21 she is just phenomenal she has picked
73:26 the things that she knows a lot about
73:28 and she's champion them championed
73:31 to a point where she is now formidable
73:33 opponent for anyone trying to keep these
73:36 lying narratives alive about the urban
73:38 America and she and in great part has
73:42 freed the the blacks of America you know
73:49 and I've said it once I'm going to say
73:51 it again I use the term black because I
73:54 don't really buy into the
73:55 african-american thing one most of the
73:58 blacks in America are mixed with the
74:02 Caucasians okay so I don't really like
74:04 black as you know was really black but
74:06 you know these people are Americans
74:09 they're not from I mean they're from
74:10 Africa but I'm from Europe I'm not a
74:12 European American my family's been here
74:15 forever
74:15 they've been here forever and to see
74:18 them take charge and kick ass and take
74:21 names it's just the name of the game
74:22 baby I love it so anyway I think you
74:26 feel me
74:27 there's just gonna come a time when we
74:29 got to get in this game and I hope that
74:32 everyone finds that thing that you can
74:34 get involved with and you probably
74:36 should limit yourself because you're
74:38 only our one human being and you can
74:40 rotate through them yeah one year you go
74:42 for chemtrails and then when you go for
74:44 drinkable water without fluoride in it
74:47 next year next year next year something
74:49 different something different but you
74:51 can stick to one thing so anyway if you
74:56 have been to deep thoughts radio.com
74:57 please go there's audio video there's a
75:00 locked Facebook group there's a Twitter
75:01 account there are two ways to contribute
75:04 to the movement financially there's
75:06 patreon for a monthly sort of thing you
75:09 can put one buck in there what you get
75:11 from that is you get early release links
75:12 to all the videos the only time I don't
75:15 do a complete really preview is if I'm
75:20 releasing on a Friday night and I want
75:21 everyone to have something as they enter
75:23 the weekend I still put it up on the
75:26 patreon the second I start uploading but
75:28 I'll usually upload that video to
75:30 immediately go public there's a PayPal
75:33 account
75:33 no one's ever used it one person
75:35 desperately asked me for it because they
75:37 just want to do a one-time contribution
75:39 it all helps it's cool again I buy quite
75:43 a bit of software to get the show going
75:44 miss Dix and all the good stuff but it's
75:47 a lot of work to drag all this stuff out
75:48 constantly again each season has a
75:51 hundred episodes and I just want you to
75:53 sit down and think about making a
75:54 hundred episodes on subjects most of my
75:56 close friends who watch the show always
75:58 come up to me and go how do you think of
75:59 new things too to talk about and I'm
76:01 like it's rough man good probably 10%
76:05 come from you guys and the rest I'm just
76:08 trying to mind my own brain as it goes
76:10 throughout the day the season one
76:13 remastering is going beautiful I'm now
76:15 at I'm in the 50s at this point and now
76:19 the shows are actually well edited to
76:22 begin with and so I'm not having to do a
76:23 hell of a lot of editing so I can do I
76:25 can do a new show in a matter of about
76:28 15 minutes which is beautiful so I'm
76:30 going to start pounding those out [ __ ]
76:32 shoot is working fantastic and probably
76:36 by the time this show actually ever airs
76:37 [ __ ] shoot and the YouTube season 1
76:41 link that's on the website will be
76:43 synched up once [ __ ] shoot hits 100
76:46 episodes then I will be able to move 300
76:50 episodes up just by uploading and
76:52 cutting and pasting the text over that's
76:56 the that's the part that takes forever
76:57 is like looking up the old videos and
76:59 what's funny is when I have to look up
77:01 my old video to then cut and paste the
77:04 description into these other services or
77:07 the other channel you know I can go into
77:10 my channel and then do a search on the
77:13 the video links which I do sometimes I'm
77:15 actually using my blog site now to do it
77:17 but it's a lot of these videos don't
77:20 come up at all and so I just found one
77:23 today which I think it was episode 42 or
77:27 something like that it was the one on
77:28 talent I didn't realize it but YouTube
77:31 had crushed the audio they completely
77:34 silenced the audio on this video so
77:37 things been up there for a long time
77:38 with no no music no speech or anything
77:42 but when I tried to search on it it
77:44 didn't come up in the search no matter
77:46 what I did so a lot of season one has
77:50 that sort of banning thing on it for
77:53 whatever reason so again probably about
77:58 15 up
77:58 on season one there's gonna be a good
78:01 10% if you're outside the United States
78:03 that will have never been accessible to
78:06 you until this remastering process so
78:09 again what I'm doing is cleaning up all
78:11 the pauses and balancing the audio
78:14 levels that's the huge thing but pretty
78:16 much around episode 50 things started
78:19 cleaning up pretty good but there was a
78:21 point my Macintosh died but that wasn't
78:23 until later on I think in season two or
78:27 three so now I run on Windows 10 when I
78:29 actually do this show if any of you were
78:32 curious I edited on a Mac saw him by
78:35 platform anyway take care of yourself in
78:39 someone else and I will see you in the
78:40 next deep thoughts over now
