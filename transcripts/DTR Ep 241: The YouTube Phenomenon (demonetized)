00:31 [Music]
00:38 late Sunday night a bit debating sort of
00:42 a new subject matter to talk about and I
00:45 think that one of them has been right in
00:48 front of our face the entire time and
00:50 mentioned in several episodes in one way
00:53 or another but it's never really been
00:56 dissected on the on the show properly
00:59 which is YouTube the YouTube phenomenon
01:04 it's sort of interesting I'm in probably
01:08 the very essence of the age bracket to
01:14 have known the world before computers to
01:19 know the world before and I mean
01:21 personal computers in people's homes and
01:24 to definitely know it before the
01:26 internet and then to know it before the
01:31 incredible deceitful you know
01:36 psyops that are going on around the
01:39 world that are now the daily churn that
01:46 are trying to shape and mold our thought
01:47 processes away from humanity with some
01:52 you know pseudo intellectual spin on it
01:56 that we're being improved through some
01:58 almost AI transhumanism right there's a
02:02 listener out there that if you monitor
02:04 the comments you'll definitely see his
02:06 works he's sort of you know a small fry
02:11 in the bigger pond of
02:13 sort of pseudo authoritarianism
02:16 individuals who go around bullying
02:19 people for their opinions and he gets
02:23 all angry all [ __ ] butthurt about his
02:28 his opinions over your opinions right
02:31 and this is a this is a huge sort of you
02:35 know higher concept problem that YouTube
02:38 presents certain YouTube channels right
02:42 and this dude has no his own channel and
02:44 he cranks out a [ __ ] ton of videos all
02:47 of which are pretty cool but the problem
02:49 is is that he gets on in his [ __ ]
02:51 righteousness
02:52 you know amusement park car with his
02:56 little laser gun and he takes a tour
02:58 around everybody that he's subscribed to
03:00 and he tries to well he absolutely
03:04 positively becomes an [ __ ] when it
03:08 comes to thought police right the very
03:10 [ __ ] problem that we have in this
03:12 world he professes that he knows
03:15 everything he professes [ __ ] that he
03:18 can't possibly know and he'll stop by
03:22 your channel and take a big [ __ ] dump
03:23 in your comment section and try to
03:25 ridicule you and then he takes his one
03:28 subscription and says boy if you don't
03:31 change your ways I'm gonna unsubscribe
03:34 [ __ ] you buddy
03:36 [ __ ] you take your [ __ ] subscription
03:39 and shove it up your ass dude right but
03:43 this guy will come in on [ __ ] like Flat
03:45 Earth right and and he's like well we
03:47 know it's a globe and bub up a bud why
03:50 the [ __ ] you let anybody talk about Flat
03:52 Earth and editor why do I let people
03:55 have their own opinions right what an
04:00 [ __ ] what a [ __ ] up human beings
04:03 brain that is running around the
04:05 internet trying to oh god make us give a
04:09 [ __ ] that he exists and I treated this
04:12 guy really really well I did for a long
04:15 time I said look man I like your videos
04:17 your you have your own good opinions
04:19 they're different than mine but there's
04:23 a bunch of [ __ ] in your certainty
04:25 that you know you can be certain that
04:29 one thing is incorrect but you can't be
04:30 certain that what you think is correct
04:33 is correct you just simply have debunked
04:36 something in a particular way that suits
04:39 you then [ __ ] great right and you
04:43 know these are the kind of people that
04:44 in like school in high school they were
04:47 the pricks that created cliques whether
04:49 or not they were the geekiest ugliest
04:50 people were the most beautiful athletic
04:52 people they got off on elitism and even
04:57 though they're not invited to the
04:58 Rothschild dinner table they will try to
05:01 construct one in their own way such that
05:04 they are trying to create the us and
05:07 them
05:08 right the me and the you right the haves
05:11 and the have-nots and and they want to
05:13 redefine what I have is so they can
05:15 suddenly declare themselves the victor
05:19 and if you don't kiss their ass then
05:23 they are superior over you right these
05:28 are the exact [ __ ] we need a
05:30 pound in the [ __ ] face literally and
05:32 it [ __ ] put their DNA on a goddamn
05:35 spaceship and send it to somewhere where
05:37 matter ceases to exist so their DNA
05:40 doesn't replicate right whoever they
05:44 speak to you needs to be removed from
05:45 their presence such that they do not
05:47 deconstruct society and these are just
05:51 some of the high-impact problems that we
05:55 have with YouTube I thought I'd start
05:56 off with a nice act one
05:58 you know Leon professional scene where
06:01 there's some ass-kicking at the
06:02 beginning YouTube has been a blessing to
06:06 society as well as a curse but I'm
06:09 Garrett I guarantee you it's probably
06:12 done more good so far than bad but it's
06:17 starting to get to a point where you
06:18 know when something a new medium starts
06:21 in the world we get infected by it we
06:23 get affected by it and it takes us a
06:28 while a decade a decade and a half to
06:30 figure out sort of how to manhandle this
06:33 new thing and so it's taken us 15 years
06:37 I think
06:38 to see how it influences things the nice
06:44 thing is that the fake press you know
06:46 the mainstream media the MSM they kind
06:49 of come in without an e without any show
06:53 so they come in and they just present
06:56 their fake wears their fake stories
06:58 they're fake narratives and we know not
07:01 to believe them because there's no shock
07:04 and awe with what they do the second it
07:07 says CNN on it you just roll your eyes
07:09 and go okay this is Mel Brooks and
07:12 history of the world part one trying to
07:14 get unemployment for Maude Adams and she
07:16 goes you know did you [ __ ] today no
07:21 did you try to [ __ ] today yes that's
07:25 faked me to you now the alternative is
07:28 not completely correct is that is the
07:30 problem but the one well let me just
07:33 tell you my opinion of folks like say ah
07:36 do you want to name any names Christ if
07:39 I name a name you might roll your eyes
07:40 and cite things but let's just say some
07:43 of these alternative media sources all
07:45 right it's what I would call and I've
07:51 never heard anyone call at this but I
07:52 would call it open journalism what's old
07:56 school journalism my old school
07:58 journalism is all about someone going
08:01 off doing a bunch of due diligence
08:02 checking their sources getting their
08:04 facts straight and then coming in and
08:08 reporting their final product and
08:10 getting an editor to vet it and maybe
08:11 other folks do vet it in the internet
08:15 world we have open journalism a horrible
08:19 thing happens in the world and we all
08:21 jump in to try and figure out you know
08:24 what happened I don't get into this [ __ ]
08:26 you know people like man you're gonna
08:27 create a Vegas you know Massacre video
08:31 and it's like no I'm not going to do
08:33 that you're gonna hear me mention it
08:35 from time to time and episodes maybe but
08:38 the main reason why you won't hear me
08:39 talk about this stuff is there's too
08:41 many people who are doing an exhaustive
08:42 job at this job and I don't need to put
08:45 my crappy little one hour on it you know
08:50 if I find out something that no one else
08:51 is talking about
08:52 some angle on it though I think will
08:54 enlighten us sure I'll make an episode
08:56 about it but you know the other thing is
08:59 that it gets really dark and I just want
09:02 this to have a slightly more positive
09:04 tone albeit this episode probably not
09:07 being included in that but we make
09:10 videos now as we discover things you
09:13 know and there's a bunch of weird sort
09:16 of anonymous people and I don't mean the
09:19 group Anonymous people that come in and
09:21 use you know these you know artificial
09:25 voices from their computers you know
09:29 part of me can understand why they
09:30 wouldn't want to use their own voice
09:31 because perhaps they're new to the
09:33 internet and but I think that's those
09:37 are things you shouldn't be listening to
09:38 I mean I don't listen to them because
09:40 they could be you know SIOP be kind of
09:44 things you know I present my face and my
09:48 voice and we just talk it out right
09:50 right but I don't do anything current
09:52 current affairs when I have my others
09:54 show and kilter radio we did once a week
09:57 or once every two weeks
09:59 the current affairs and that gets really
10:01 boring really fast
10:02 we need deeper thinking in my opinion
10:05 which is why I've created this show but
10:08 you know again you're not gonna get two
10:10 people in a church let's just say you
10:12 get two old people who are in a church
10:14 together and they've been going to a
10:16 church for 50 years they're in their 70s
10:19 or they're in their 60s and be going
10:20 since they were a little kid together
10:21 you listen to all the same sermons they
10:25 will not interpret the Bible the same
10:27 and they'll be sections in the Bible
10:29 they will interpret completely opposite
10:31 they would argue and in fight and go to
10:34 blows if they really were forced to
10:38 ingest each other's opinion of the Bible
10:40 and so it's easy to go around and jump
10:45 into people's channels and be a dick and
10:48 just say you don't believe what I
10:50 believe [ __ ] you I'm gonna unsubscribe
10:52 psych hey save your comment buddy save
10:55 your [ __ ] energy right
10:57 I should note real quickly deep thoughts
11:01 is a place where everyone's invited who
11:03 is trying to help the world
11:05 right I will represent as much as I can
11:09 both sides of the fence right there's
11:12 not a lot of people pissing and moaning
11:14 that the cons that you know that they
11:16 believe the world is a globe so you know
11:20 there's been this criticism that I allow
11:22 a lot of you folks who believe in flat
11:24 errors to post your posts on the locked
11:26 Facebook page and I think it's really
11:28 funny so the guy comes in he goes man
11:30 you're letting them take over your page
11:31 man my [ __ ] is hurting because I read
11:34 too many of those things right and I'm
11:36 like yeah because that's the controversy
11:38 you [ __ ] realize that's the
11:40 controversy that the world might be a
11:43 different shape than round most the Flat
11:45 Earth folks well I should say a lot of
11:47 them are now coming around and going
11:48 well there's a bunch of basic things
11:51 about the way the Sun behaves and maybe
11:54 it's not round but it doesn't seem
11:56 globish either I mean I'm buddy round
11:58 but I mean disc flattish thing right but
12:02 if we if we let these people come in and
12:05 do this thought police game where does
12:08 that end where does it end you know Oh
12:11 Joey over here has a soft [ __ ] and so
12:14 everyone who offends you know his
12:17 harmonic frequency of anal comfort is
12:19 now gonna have to pull out of the game
12:22 because it'll hurt his little anal
12:24 feelings right ah
12:27 take your butt hurt someplace else I'm
12:30 sure there's an auntie 4 group with your
12:32 [ __ ] movement in it right maybe the
12:35 way to say it is you know this is a
12:36 group for grownups and it doesn't matter
12:38 how old you are you could be 14 years
12:41 old listen to this and if this grooves
12:43 with your brain then you're ahead of the
12:45 game
12:45 brother sister you're ahead of the game
12:48 but it's interesting how certain things
12:50 are beautiful cross sections of society
12:52 right for those of you who listen to
12:54 this in your car on the way to traffic
12:56 how amazing it is it is it that traffic
12:59 is a beautiful cross section of your
13:01 societies your governments ability to
13:03 teach people how to drive you know and I
13:07 found it's on a very district level
13:09 right but some countries have my amazing
13:12 tests for you to drive you don't get
13:15 keys to a [ __ ] car and a driver's
13:18 license unless you
13:19 past excruciating tests right I mean my
13:23 dad was one hell of a driving instructor
13:25 and I took all I'll earned everything he
13:29 brought me and then I went off to school
13:31 and took six months of driver's training
13:33 I didn't have to I already had my
13:36 driver's license the 14 I didn't need to
13:39 [ __ ] take any classes but I did and
13:41 why because I wanted to make sure I
13:42 didn't kill myself or other people when
13:45 I wanted to drive a motorcycle on the
13:47 street you know I grew up with dirt
13:49 bikes my whole life there you just hop
13:52 on and do what you got to do and I
13:53 probably had you know let's see a good
13:58 six years of experience on dirt bikes
14:01 before I ever gotten to a street bike
14:03 that I went and took classes from school
14:06 in the summertime I could have been you
14:09 know off doing some crazy [ __ ] but I was
14:13 taking these courses so I get my Class C
14:17 license ordeal is over the [ __ ] it was
14:19 what's interesting about the thought
14:21 police [ __ ] is that here we are on
14:24 this show right what's the theme of this
14:26 show to rebuild society from the bottom
14:28 up and I don't mean to do this to assert
14:31 that I have all the answers and that you
14:33 know come to me as the Oracle know I
14:35 will bake you some cookies though well
14:38 that kid bends the spoon in the front
14:39 room but aside from that this is a wee
14:43 situation so we work together I pitch
14:46 out all the all the ideas initially you
14:49 guys reply to them in the comment
14:51 section we have these great tiny little
14:53 conversations in the conversation
14:55 section and then a bunch of you will
14:56 chime in and say hey you should consider
14:58 this is an episode that is an episode
15:00 right so good 20% of the episodes are
15:03 all about you
15:04 you guys mentioning what should be done
15:06 I love it it's perfect I feel like we
15:10 keep it classy on this show I really do
15:12 despite my filthy mouth in this episode
15:15 but the name of the game is to keep the
15:17 conversation open right to scrutinize
15:22 what we believe to be either true or
15:24 false or maybe that's the name of the
15:26 game someone coming in bullying everyone
15:30 in the room has got to be escorted out
15:32 right okay enough about that subject now
15:39 a lot of you have heard me talk about
15:40 Marshall McLuhan
15:41 and for those of you who've never heard
15:42 of the guy depending on your level of
15:46 curiosity with how messages to the brain
15:51 affect the brain he is a wonderful stop
15:55 off I will just simply warn you that his
15:58 vocabulary is unreal unbelievable when I
16:05 read his writings my brain hurts I get
16:09 tired
16:09 Jean bozo art is another man that can
16:12 absolutely just exhaust you with
16:16 unbelievable insight and you will have
16:18 to what I say you'll have to read his
16:22 stuff several times like I always say
16:24 one page or Jean Baudrillard is like a
16:26 steak dinner
16:26 same with Marshall McLuhan but in order
16:30 to understand what YouTube means to us
16:34 we have to recognize that is you know
16:37 what he was what he was talking about is
16:39 a medium that engages the mind right now
16:43 most of you know this right but you know
16:45 in case you're brand-new to the show let
16:46 me just say one sentence to catch you
16:48 catch you up here to the degree a medium
16:50 meaning television film YouTube your
16:52 telephone your desktop and infects the
16:55 senses of your of your body in your mind
16:57 right if it could give you touch it
17:00 would mean something different than if
17:01 it can't give you touch it gives you
17:03 sight and sound it's pretty damn
17:05 powerful right how many times have you
17:08 watched some sort of YouTube video and
17:10 you cried some real story about a
17:13 soldier coming home a dog coming home
17:15 someone you know died I don't know but
17:19 we have to recognize is that this is
17:21 this is basically light and sound waves
17:23 coming out of electronic device having
17:25 been recorded and edited at a separate
17:27 location and uploaded a separate time
17:29 you could watch a video ten years later
17:31 and you're just completely mystified
17:33 about whatever it's presenting you could
17:35 be affected by it that's phenomenal what
17:39 is it it's just recorded visual
17:41 pixelation and sound waves that can be
17:45 recreated any point in time wow what a
17:48 powerful situation very similar to man
17:51 scribing things on the walls of caves
17:53 you know many many probably hundreds of
17:56 thousands years ago we can see what they
18:00 were thinking that's phenomenal so what
18:04 does YouTube do for us well the first
18:07 thing is sight and sound that's what it
18:08 provides right there's been a little
18:11 foray into virtual reality so you get
18:15 360 things you can put a headset on and
18:17 see things in 3d that's pretty cool
18:19 and in 2d pretty cool but the number one
18:23 thing that it becomes a bit of a problem
18:26 is the concept that man lies to man and
18:34 its really gigantic corporations and
18:36 governments and military that lead the
18:38 way of lying to the people to control
18:41 them to turn them into serfs right and
18:43 so we know how the game was played
18:45 before the internet it was all about
18:48 print magazines and newspapers and
18:51 television it's a little bit in the
18:54 movie area it actually took a while to
18:57 infiltrate television the way they've
18:58 done today
18:59 I mean film film film and television
19:02 both where now you have you know
19:05 television action was co-opted a long
19:07 time ago was it George and Gracie I
19:09 think back in the 30s and 40s or
19:12 whatever you know they would stop the
19:14 show and integrate in a Campbell Soup
19:17 advertisement directly inside of the
19:22 show I mean she would cook with it stuff
19:25 is actually quite frankly it was a lot
19:27 better in my opinion back then because
19:28 at least you knew what the hell was
19:29 going on you knew that the script
19:31 stopped and here comes an advertisement
19:32 and then the script starts again it's
19:35 kind of neat as opposed to a commercial
19:36 break right but now scripts are modified
19:40 right these companies come in and they
19:42 modify things these big giants you know
19:47 agendas sneak in through shills you talk
19:51 about shills baby you got people taking
19:53 strips that were great and stuffing in
19:54 global warming [ __ ] and a bunch of other
19:56 agendas which
19:58 I will name you know well yeah and it's
20:03 something you know it seems strange
20:04 right how many how many episodes of the
20:09 new Star Trek Discovery now are just
20:11 carrying agenda after agenda after
20:13 agenda right it's pretty gross the
20:20 YouTube is very fascinating because it's
20:24 just a melting pot depending on your
20:26 search history you can actually get you
20:29 know cross-reference with channels that
20:31 you subscribe to where you could watch
20:33 fake news in one video and then the very
20:36 next thing do two keywords is they they
20:38 comb inside the channels that you
20:39 subscribe to if you're not unsubscribed
20:41 right and it will refer you to something
20:45 that counter acts the fake news and
20:49 shows you're really where it's all at
20:50 it's very interesting now what's
20:54 interesting about the show is that I
20:56 think I'm a small fry eighteen hundred
20:59 and forty subscribers at this point
21:02 alright what you know so I'm touching if
21:05 every single human being is subscribed
21:07 watch the video one time every video
21:08 would have eight hundred and forty or
21:10 eighteen hundred and forty views well
21:12 that doesn't happen most of time right
21:14 I've only got half a dozen episodes that
21:16 surpassed my subscription count but they
21:21 are unsubscribing using an artificial
21:23 intelligence but a lot of you guys they
21:27 just and it happens all in one day
21:28 that's the interesting thing you know I
21:31 won't have released a video that's you
21:34 know like this one that's very saucy
21:37 with a bunch of insults or whatever and
21:41 it'll just I'll sit there and watch it
21:43 you know I'll just refresh my phone if
21:44 the phone app finally shows you how many
21:46 subscribers subscribers you have at the
21:48 top of the front interface and so you
21:50 know I'll see if you there's always
21:51 someone dropping off you know I
21:53 understand so you know you have to and
21:54 then it'll start dropping it'll be like
21:56 you know ten people drop off now these
22:00 could be fake accounts that get kind of
22:02 scraped up by an artificial intelligence
22:04 and they get rid of them but there are
22:06 subscribers that now have reported in
22:08 and said look I was unsubscribed from
22:10 your chat
22:11 I haven't seen the last four videos
22:13 because I didn't know they even came out
22:15 right so we have evidence that
22:21 shenanigans are going on at YouTube and
22:25 it could be sort of renegade bots that
22:27 are doing things but at no point should
22:29 anyone be unsubscribed you know if
22:32 YouTube would track like your age for
22:35 instance and your channel is a you know
22:38 you check the checkbox for 18 and over
22:41 content which I don't even know what the
22:42 hell that would be and then they say
22:45 look you shouldn't be subscribed to this
22:46 but they don't send you a notice that
22:48 they've unsubscribe so it's all
22:49 shenanigans right I have a hard time
22:52 believing that you know YouTube is
22:55 deploying builds that are that erroneous
22:57 and that screwed up you know a bug for a
22:59 day sure you know maybe that would be
23:01 dead probably national news if not
23:02 international news Oh YouTube had a bug
23:04 and you know 10 million subscribers were
23:08 unsubscribed or 100 million subscribers
23:10 unsubscribe from their favorite channels
23:11 or whatever and that would be news we
23:14 all get back in and fix it and they'll
23:16 be over fixed nope this [ __ ] happens all
23:19 [ __ ] day long right but isn't it
23:22 interesting today well it's a compare it
23:26 first in the past if you had any type of
23:29 horrific situation important situation
23:32 in world history national history local
23:35 history you would turn on the television
23:37 and you would try to get the information
23:38 and you had a couple options before
23:41 24-hour news which happened in the mid
23:44 80s with CNN's headline news you would
23:47 have to turn on the radio
23:48 most the time and they would give you
23:50 the sort of daily updates I mean start
23:53 of the hourly updates of everything that
23:54 was discovered your newspapers could do
23:57 a double issue in a particular day so
23:58 you can issue in the morning an issue in
24:00 the evening the evening edition normal
24:03 news on TV you know there's a morning
24:05 news sort of evening news and then sort
24:08 of the late night news I really you know
24:10 more news at 11:00 it was always trying
24:12 to bait you and I always thought it was
24:14 just reprehensible that they would have
24:16 information that could save lives and
24:19 they would say news at 11:00 right
24:21 hurricane you know Podesta's come
24:25 and Florida it's gonna rape all your
24:29 children and and you could all die and
24:31 it's gonna hit in five minutes they'll
24:33 be like eight o'clock at night and
24:34 they'll say news at 11:00 you know so
24:36 you're sitting there getting plastered
24:38 by this hurricane while they're baiting
24:42 you into advertising the news used to
24:45 also have this [ __ ] game he used to
24:47 play where they would have the one thing
24:49 you really want to know you know would
24:51 be I don't know something amazing that
24:54 was going on and they would hold it to
24:55 the last segment of the news because
24:57 they knew everything else that they were
24:58 saying to you was boring as hell
25:01 say hoes well you know I mean it's like
25:03 five minutes to the end of the hour and
25:04 they've got a litter like a two to three
25:06 minute segment of the thing you really
25:07 wanted to see that's all gone now
25:09 it's all cool on-demand fun on-demand
25:13 it's nice right they don't have our you
25:17 know our private parts held by the short
25:20 hairs anymore you want to know about
25:22 something go online you want to know
25:24 about it conspiracy go online go online
25:27 the second after it happened right but
25:31 then you have to break you have to break
25:34 down YouTube by age brackets because you
25:37 have a level of gullibility that is
25:41 different for every decade that a
25:43 generation has right so you're the one
25:46 through tens have a love of gullibility
25:47 ten through twenty twenty to thirty
25:50 cetera all the way up and what's really
25:53 fascinating is is you have like we just
25:56 had a you know some some shootings and
25:59 Dallas or is I don't even know [ __ ]
26:02 somewhere in Texas Church got shot up
26:04 and I sit and watch how people fall for
26:07 the propaganda around the event the gun
26:10 control propaganda right we have folks
26:14 that have used computer graphics right
26:18 CG by the way Hollywood doesn't say CGI
26:21 Hollywood says CG at most computer
26:24 graphics right but they will create you
26:28 know students art students will create
26:29 things certain artistic directors will
26:34 create things I forgot the guy's name
26:35 but this foreign director created this
26:39 amazing piece which is an amusement park
26:42 that has all these kind of impossible
26:44 rides and man it looks real I mean this
26:47 guy did an amazing job
26:49 he contacted my buddy said me to work
26:51 with him a little bit so I know the
26:53 backstory this guy but just phenomenal
26:56 just I mean it looks so unbelievably
26:59 real and it's integrated with
27:00 live-action shots of people out of the
27:01 museum park so someone must have filmed
27:03 an amusement park and then he kind of
27:04 green screened it out and then fit in
27:06 all this incredible 3d rendering but
27:08 they're crazy rides that could never
27:11 exist right they're so amazing but I
27:13 that thing is like five five years old
27:16 2017 today something like toute and I
27:20 see it reposted all the time by soccer
27:22 moms that think it's real and you know I
27:26 don't blame them the thing looks as real
27:28 as can be but they're like oh my god a
27:31 couple of my buddies a couple I think a
27:32 couple people listen to this show that
27:34 I'm friends with post it as if it's real
27:37 but it's not real there's a famous
27:40 advertisement that was shot where a
27:42 plane was a jet was coming in to land
27:45 supposedly in South America and it it's
27:47 weaving really bad and it and it starts
27:50 weaving between buildings you know comes
27:53 in off the coast and someone's faking
27:54 you know turning the camera it's an
27:56 advertisement it's an advertisement that
27:59 had the ad you know the bumper at the
28:03 end with the brand of what they were
28:05 trying to saw I don't know what they
28:06 were trying to sell I forgot I used to
28:08 know but you know if you look really
28:11 closely you'll see rotoscoping problems
28:13 and stuff if you're educated special
28:15 effects you'll see all kinds of issues
28:16 with it
28:16 so for me it looks brilliant but it
28:19 looks fake amusement park thing I only
28:21 know it's fake because I took physics
28:24 you know so there's a lot of deception
28:28 going on that are I would say pretty
28:32 much 50 and up there's an amazing little
28:35 level of gullibility it's 16 up it
28:38 doubles the 70 up it's almost absolute
28:40 if you want to lie to someone who's 70
28:42 years or more up it's just a hundred
28:44 percent just make it up and throw it on
28:47 line and they'll believe it especially
28:49 if it if it ties in with their
28:51 preconceived
28:52 notions of the world that they're trying
28:54 to get everyone to believe right and so
28:58 there's an information problem with what
29:02 is real and what is fake but what do we
29:06 do do we turn on some you know thought
29:08 police stuff do you have to actually
29:10 designate in your video this is fake
29:11 little youtube fake button and if you
29:14 don't push that button then you know
29:16 your account gets cancelled and you get
29:20 arrested or something did you imagine
29:22 like it's a whole prison of people who
29:23 posted fake [ __ ] what are you in for
29:25 I posted fake you know music apart [ __ ]
29:27 oh yeah no what'd you do oh I did a
29:29 bunch of UFO videos in Mexico City okay
29:32 that's brilliant dude the thing is is in
29:36 society we've had a lot of different
29:38 things that were free at the beginning
29:40 and I don't mean that you didn't have to
29:41 pay for them it's just there weren't
29:43 laws around the activity and then you
29:46 get a bunch of gullible people right you
29:49 know the the dumbest kid in the
29:50 classroom for whatever reason
29:52 generational reasons are just vocational
29:54 reasons and we have to impose laws to
29:58 protect the idiots of the world thus
30:00 gagging everyone who's got their [ __ ]
30:02 together and there's a problem with that
30:05 you know the whole net neutrality thing
30:07 that Obama put through and giving over
30:09 the control of the Internet to the ICANN
30:12 folks you know it's part of this TPP
30:15 thing where the corporation's were
30:17 lining themselves up to be able to sue
30:19 every single one of us that ever
30:20 mentions them luckily they got that got
30:24 sidestep for a little while right let's
30:26 hope that never ever happens
30:30 China supposedly is turning on the
30:34 person rating thing that was in black
30:36 mirror season 3 episode 1 is about an
30:41 app that you download on your phone
30:42 where you rate people it's also the an
30:45 episode of Orville but you essentially
30:49 are rated as to how you're behaved and
30:52 how you're received and it goes all the
30:54 way to your bills to your health so if
30:56 you're obese talk about fat shaming haha
31:00 this thing is gonna [ __ ] you up man but
31:04 China
31:05 - this a pretty detailed video on
31:08 YouTube that I saw from a fairly
31:09 reliable source it's the woman that does
31:12 the talking cat thing it's truth
31:14 something or there I really love her
31:16 videos but she says they're rolling out
31:20 this app and it's been an electoral app
31:22 that you don't have to play with but now
31:24 they're gonna make it law they're gonna
31:25 move it into a legal realm and if you
31:28 don't play well then you don't get to
31:29 build up points and if you don't build
31:30 up points you can't do [ __ ] in the
31:32 country I mean you can't leave the
31:34 country for one thing but they're gonna
31:36 lock you down if you don't have points
31:40 okay so let's let's bring that to
31:45 America for one second right it's gonna
31:47 be a long [ __ ] time if they bring it
31:49 here but I'm making sure like this I
31:52 tell you things like the Big Bang's fake
31:55 very simple I prove it to you
31:58 mathematically in all my episodes when I
32:00 break it down how it's impossible how it
32:02 would create a absolutely unified
32:04 universe on all sides and thus
32:07 extinguish the randomness that we see in
32:11 the universe that creates life making
32:13 job making God's job impossible right
32:16 okay but now let's say there's a bunch
32:18 of CERN people ten thousand people who
32:20 build CERN 20 billion euro [ __ ] waste
32:25 of money unless there's something else
32:26 they're doing underneath will they just
32:31 get 10,000 people to chime in to your
32:34 app by app my identity and they take a
32:37 big [ __ ] on my score and it's only
32:40 because they've been indoctrinated to
32:41 believe horseshit that they're gonna
32:43 dump me down Copernicus Galileo all
32:49 these people who were you know
32:51 trailblazers voted down by the idiots by
32:57 the mob and that's what that app will do
33:00 and then what you've done is you've
33:02 created a society of what Douglas Adams
33:05 called the bee arc and The Hitchhiker's
33:06 Guide to the galaxy all the most
33:08 ignorant and confident people of the
33:10 world hiding inside an application
33:13 instead of living life voting everyone
33:17 down or up
33:18 right the most unqualified folks to
33:21 express an opinion about another human
33:23 beings qualities will have absolute
33:25 control of those attributes as perceived
33:29 by the rest of the world I've been an
33:32 analogy several times on the show about
33:33 drinking Drano what I want you to
33:36 understand how bad toxins are for your
33:38 body aspartame fluoride all these
33:41 different things right
33:42 GMOs glyphosate you know bleached flour
33:47 the bleach they used to bleach flour is
33:50 actually a chemical that gives rats and
33:54 laboratories diabetes so they can do
33:56 experiments on them but we feel that
33:58 white wheat is cleaner than brown wheat
34:01 right and I say if I said you know drink
34:06 some Drano and let's just see what
34:08 happens you would go no way I said you
34:12 don't drink a bunch of it just eat a
34:13 little bit with all everything that you
34:15 eat what do you mean I'll put it on your
34:17 PB&J put it in your water put it in your
34:20 coke well no way well why well it'll
34:22 kill me eventually okay and then I
34:25 explained that there's no difference in
34:27 drinking Drano a little bit of Drano and
34:29 all of your food and eating half the
34:31 food that's available if not 80% of food
34:32 that's available in the United States of
34:34 America because of all of the
34:36 sanctioning by the Food and Drug
34:38 Administration who is nothing more than
34:41 a condom for the pharmaceutical and food
34:44 industry they pick the people who grant
34:49 authoritative you know they grant the
34:52 authority for that stuff to be sold they
34:53 certified to be sold to be healthy
34:56 appointed not voted all having formal
35:01 Lobby connections with the very
35:03 companies that create this stuff okay
35:06 why am I going on about that a YouTube
35:08 video about YouTube alright again
35:11 YouTube is a great thing right now it's
35:13 free and we are we are an honorably way
35:16 constructing what it becomes other than
35:21 you know some censorship here channels
35:23 getting knocked out which you know I
35:26 will tell you this much there's a lot
35:28 more claims about channels being can
35:32 sold and turned off then actually are
35:35 true right so someone will say a
35:38 channels been I was told that the black
35:40 pigeon guy was turned off
35:42 he has been turned off crow 777 dude
35:46 said he was turned off the second I get
35:48 the notice I go look up the channels
35:50 right there in my face
35:51 like what the [ __ ] you talking about was
35:53 it turn off for a split second like
35:54 Trump's Twitter account or what's the
35:56 deal I don't see this sanctioning going
35:58 on it's like people lying just to create
36:01 more drama now I do believe that people
36:03 are being unsubscribed from my channel
36:06 could be a little glitch I don't know
36:09 but we have to understand that this is
36:12 an open platform for us to mess around
36:14 with if we had to pay for all the
36:18 bandwidth charges for the videos
36:20 especially this show this show has over
36:22 two hundred and fifty five episodes do
36:24 you realize that if I had to pay out of
36:27 pocket every time you guys watch the
36:29 show I would be broke this show has only
36:34 been on the air quote-unquote for two
36:37 years in about four months okay it has
36:40 been listened to for 11 years now that's
36:44 how much all the minutes combined equal
36:47 I'm willing to bet at I think these are
36:50 about about a gig and a half once
36:55 YouTube compresses them I mean how many
36:58 gigs is that here's the thing the reason
37:02 why I went off on the toxin thing is
37:03 this we are currently in control of what
37:10 we watch on YouTube you know and I don't
37:13 mean that you're getting all of the
37:14 search results that you want to get
37:16 because we know that that's also policed
37:17 people inside YouTube have said you know
37:20 I there's a couple guys that actually
37:22 talk about how they control what goes to
37:25 the the main feed and you know that's
37:28 got to happen there's got to be people
37:29 that cherry-pick things and move them to
37:32 the front feeds it can't be all just
37:33 trending because someone could put up a
37:37 nude video an x-rated video and you know
37:41 it's like who there's you know full
37:45 contact sex
37:46 in there and it goes all the way to the
37:47 top and goes to the front page and gets
37:48 a hundred million views by freaking you
37:51 know miners that's why they have to
37:54 police what goes into the main threat
37:57 it's not a conspiracy necessarily are
38:00 they going to promote my video on the
38:02 moon hoax hell no because of the
38:06 political uproar that would happen and
38:08 it's not that they give a [ __ ] that
38:09 anyone thinks that we didn't go to the
38:11 moon it's just they don't need the extra
38:13 political hassle and the climate that we
38:15 have now where someone just has to bully
38:18 you right
38:19 it's funny how all the people that are
38:21 complaining about being bullied have
38:23 turned into the biggest bullies right
38:26 it's not just defending themselves
38:28 they've gone above and beyond
38:30 I think normal rapport with society to
38:34 bully people into certain belief systems
38:36 like the guy that comes to my channel
38:37 and tries to bully us all into his
38:39 belief systems you can't just leave us
38:40 alone
38:41 and before that we had a guy who was
38:44 very religious gonna be very upset and
38:47 it's very strange how they come in and
38:49 they'll kind of their first comments are
38:51 like hey you know we believe completely
38:53 different things and that's cool and I'm
38:54 like great that's awesome I dig you man
38:56 come on back show me where I can get
38:58 your opinion it's great but it just kind
39:01 of evolves in their system to the point
39:04 where they're just can't handle it
39:06 they cannot handle someone else having
39:08 an opinion different than their own and
39:10 they want to accuse you of being part of
39:12 the problem right as if were somehow
39:16 unraveling reality by letting people
39:19 have a voice by not bullying people back
39:22 and instead providing a comforting sofa
39:26 to sit down and maybe a cigar if you
39:28 smoke right you're let me give you an
39:32 example of the difference between being
39:35 educated through bullying and being
39:37 educated through understanding and you
39:40 know we're all flawed with the first
39:43 example here right and I've done it on
39:46 the show several times most likely where
39:48 I'm really asserting my belief system
39:50 and something I did it in the show
39:55 there's been several times when I was a
39:57 young man and I would say mmm probably
40:01 before the age of 20 where I definitely
40:07 had an opinion about something and I was
40:09 so certain that I had it figured out
40:11 right and what's beautiful about the
40:16 process that I've actually experienced
40:17 several times before I was 20 was this
40:21 typically like an older male who yeah my
40:26 dad's army buddy who had seen you know
40:28 three tours in Vietnam shot down five
40:31 times by the way his helicopter is
40:33 actually in the Smithsonian I just
40:34 learned that recently how [ __ ] cool
40:36 that's how badass that dude was one of
40:39 my huge mentors as a child for a very
40:41 short period of time but damn it just
40:43 his example in life was so powerful for
40:45 me is ridiculous but you know my dad
40:50 always had you know it's funny because I
40:52 could tell you how great my dad was but
40:53 the best place the best way for me to
40:55 tell you how great my father is was that
41:00 you know my entire lifetime his best
41:02 friends were amazing people and the only
41:05 ones that turned out to be weirdos were
41:07 folks that he indentified his weirdos
41:11 and we both got rid of them
41:13 you know but that was very very rare I
41:15 only remember one guy was [ __ ]
41:17 strange as hell dude and to give you an
41:19 example the weirdo I met this dude was
41:22 working with my father so was like my
41:24 father was forced to be with him due to
41:25 his job but when I announced that I was
41:28 going to California at the age of 17
41:31 you know people perk up their ears it's
41:34 really funny and this guy came in and
41:37 said I've just got them mowing the lawn
41:40 I can't really say what he said to me on
41:44 the show believe it or not that's but
41:46 I'm gonna give you I'm gonna get you
41:47 there somehow and it with Harvey
41:50 Weinstein thing going on this will make
41:52 a whole lot of sense this is 1987 must
41:54 be June I probably July of 87 I got them
41:58 only while my dad's working on a car
41:59 engine in the garage it's summertime
42:02 it's hot and this dude came up to me
42:05 cousin he was Frank
42:07 and he came up to me and he said I heard
42:09 you're going to California I said yeah
42:11 and this guy looks at me and and to
42:15 paraphrase his assertion okay he asked
42:19 me if I would be willing to let a grown
42:21 man perform a sexual act on me and if I
42:26 did he could hook me up such that I
42:28 could I guess do really well in LA yeah
42:33 so he was a weirdo he also I think was a
42:37 pathological liar in many ways you know
42:40 my brain I barely knew what you know
42:44 homosexuality was at that age and I'm
42:46 just kind of going know like what is
42:48 that kind of [ __ ] question right it's
42:52 probably one of the last times I ever
42:54 saw the guy I don't even know if he's
42:55 still alive to this day but all the
42:58 other dudes were amazing and my point
43:00 for mentioning the other guys was that I
43:02 would come barreling into a conversation
43:04 barreling into reality with some opinion
43:07 of mine and these totally seasoned grown
43:12 men who had seen it all I mean or they'd
43:14 seen enough to to be able to laugh
43:17 inside when they see this little guy
43:20 coming in you know they would kind of
43:23 you know take that attitude of like oh
43:24 really well well why don't you why don't
43:26 we sit down and have a beer and you tell
43:27 me about it right or whatever and I'd
43:29 sit down and we'd have this thing and
43:31 they'd get me to say everything right I
43:33 would say everything out loud that I
43:35 they just gave me full control over the
43:39 conversation and gave me a canvas to
43:41 paint what I was believing at that point
43:43 in time and then they would sort of
43:45 engage in a rhetorical conversation with
43:48 me because they knew that I knew better
43:50 in a lot of areas and they would just
43:52 say well do you think this is that way
43:54 why about that do you think that's that
43:55 way and eventually I would contradict
43:57 myself in the conversation and wake the
43:59 [ __ ] up and it made me a young man as
44:03 opposed to a young boy in my
44:06 professional life I at least had one
44:09 boss that was very similar to that where
44:11 I was behaving very poorly and probably
44:14 before I was 20 I told this story a long
44:18 time ago repeat it now so you can get
44:19 kind of a
44:20 a consensus on this and this is again
44:23 the reason why I'm telling you these
44:24 little anecdotes is that I want you to
44:26 think about how we behave when people
44:28 come at us online right but I worked in
44:32 this department that's it's it's such a
44:35 funny petty thing and I was such a
44:37 [ __ ] it wasn't that something
44:39 shouldn't be said but I was I just went
44:42 off the off the handle on this guy and
44:46 yes so what happened was I come to work
44:48 it's real early in the morning I work in
44:51 a tech support department and this guy
44:55 turns the corner and he goes he's got
44:59 you know how when you get Oreo cookies
45:00 there's three rows inside the Oreo
45:03 cookies this dude I think up my boss had
45:06 brought in some Oreo cookies and he
45:07 opened it up so they're working to have
45:09 some Oreo cookies with their coffee
45:10 right and in America ok I don't know
45:14 about other countries we would probably
45:16 only take me three or four with the
45:19 coffee that's probably enough even if
45:21 you're having eaten breakfast and you
45:24 would just leave the rest for everyone
45:26 else this guy takes his hand as big as
45:30 he can get his hand and takes probably
45:32 2/3 of a single row I don't even know
45:34 how many that is right 10 and he had
45:36 already shoved a ton in his mouth and he
45:39 comes around the corner and this guy is
45:40 in his mid-20s he's a teacher of sort of
45:45 as he would describe it disadvantaged
45:47 kids in downtown Los Angeles so just
45:49 kids that are oppressed in bad
45:50 neighborhoods so he's an educated guy
45:53 and he's got his face his mouth as so
45:56 full as cheeks are bulging and he's
45:58 trying to tell me hey did you did you
46:00 notice that someone brought Oreo cookies
46:02 in but he can't really pronounce
46:03 anything because he's he's got his face
46:06 stuff with cookies and this guy was from
46:08 Russia nicest freaking guy on planet
46:10 Earth he's the sweetest guy he just
46:12 culturally didn't figure out that maybe
46:14 you shouldn't [ __ ] Bogart all the
46:16 goddamn cookies right and I looked at
46:19 him and I was so [ __ ] pissed at how
46:22 non empathetic he was towards the
46:25 offering right we have probably I don't
46:29 know 10 people in this department and
46:30 this guy takes almost a third of the
46:33 whole bag for
46:33 self-right I know you guys are rolling
46:36 your eyes like dude this is so [ __ ]
46:37 petty what are you talking about so
46:39 anyway I stood there with my boss no
46:42 more than 15 feet away from me with the
46:44 door open to his office I'm standing in
46:47 this cube area and I don't even know
46:48 what I said that I was you know cussing
46:50 him out and I said you know I didn't
46:52 yell or anything but I just said you
46:55 know what the [ __ ] are you doing taking
46:57 all these goddamn cookies don't you have
46:58 any empathy for this you know I didn't
47:00 see him busy but I said you know she
47:01 under consideration for other people and
47:03 he was sort of mystified right and I I
47:06 you know I used dirty words on him and
47:08 stuff and he and I were the first two
47:10 people and said no one else was there
47:11 yet and he kind of was smiling the whole
47:13 time well he had this stuff in his head
47:16 he I don't think he put anything back
47:17 and I look at my boss and my boss just
47:20 give me this face like these big ol eyes
47:22 he's like oh my god did you just say
47:24 that to him what I didn't know was this
47:27 guy I'm talking to his employee friend
47:30 of mine this colleague of mine is like
47:32 one of the baddest martial arts guys at
47:38 the time I mean he really was just super
47:41 badass guy and he was actually in a
47:43 bunch of Hollywood movies he was in a
47:44 John Cusack movie have you ever seen the
47:47 movie where he John Cusack goes back to
47:49 his high school reunion and he goes out
47:50 of the main reunion he gets his ass
47:52 kicked in the hallway the guy kicking
47:55 his ass is this guy it's [ __ ]
47:57 hilarious right so he blew it off and my
48:02 boss sort of he's looking at me funny
48:05 and I'm kind of like I'm so stupid at
48:07 the time I'm going what you know what
48:09 what the [ __ ] look at this guy yeah
48:10 someone should say something I said it I
48:12 you know no one else gonna [ __ ] say
48:13 and I'm gonna say it right and then my
48:15 boss sort of let me know what danger I
48:19 might have been in he had I actually
48:21 pissed this guy off I very happy that
48:25 even the guy I'm talking to was a bigger
48:26 man than me right and he you know he
48:29 comes from a rough neighborhood where he
48:31 came from and he knows kids lipping off
48:34 to him and schools that are really you
48:35 know ghetto ii and so he's been theis
48:37 I'm nothing I'm just like this little
48:39 white boy running my [ __ ] mouth but I
48:42 try to be that to people on line they're
48:45 all upset because I don't know if I'm
48:47 talking
48:47 to a twelve-year-old or some [ __ ]
48:49 psychotic guy all right
48:53 the YouTube has brought all this
48:56 together and you know psychology is
48:59 obviously the study of the individual
49:01 sociology being the study of a society
49:03 and how it behaves YouTube is a
49:07 sociological phenomenon to see how this
49:10 medium is affecting us we have to be
49:13 careful what we ingest otherwise it will
49:15 turn into the Drano for our brain it'll
49:19 mess us up you know the thing and I'm
49:23 just gonna use this this individual as a
49:25 beautiful stepping stone but I've been
49:27 criticized several times about
49:28 mentioning Eric Dubay and not calling
49:31 him a bunch of names right after I
49:33 mention his name
49:35 I am criticized for in the past saying I
49:38 like the guy right I don't know where
49:42 every Dubey I've never met him I've
49:44 never exchanged anything with him but
49:47 you know I think he has a stick he's
49:51 doing and it really works and I think
49:53 that I can definitely tell you he's
49:55 opened my mind considerably to a lot of
49:58 different things whether or not he's
49:59 correct or not I could give a [ __ ] how
50:01 absolutely factual this guy stuff is
50:04 what he does to me is keep my mind open
50:09 right it's not just informative black
50:13 pigeon keeps me informed right that
50:18 woman that does the cat videos whatever
50:20 she keeps me informed
50:22 but Eric Dubay keeps my mind open and I
50:26 think that the rarest thing you can do
50:28 for a human being is to keep it open
50:30 because the clamping down from the media
50:32 and society and television and [ __ ]
50:34 everything out there is trying to close
50:36 your mind right I was talking to one of
50:40 our more brilliant listeners and he was
50:46 he's hoping in my mind to potentially a
50:48 sequel to the Santa Claus episode which
50:52 I won't divulge kind of what we talked
50:54 about so it'll be in an episode but the
50:56 one thing that kind of came out of our
50:57 quick conversation was you know the
51:00 power of destroying
51:01 magic because you know you teach your
51:04 child that there's this magical being in
51:06 the North Pole and then over the course
51:07 of one evening he delivers presents to
51:10 all the children of the world and that's
51:13 for a child that doesn't know there's
51:14 other religions that don't worship Him
51:16 right but at some point you have to
51:20 break it to your child that this is all
51:22 a fictional construct and try not to
51:24 scar your child in the middle the
51:26 process was saying yeah I'm your parent
51:28 I've been lying to you for whatever
51:29 seven to nine years that you've been
51:32 believing in this right now if you
51:34 haven't seen the Santa Claus episode
51:35 that's a passion passionate topic for
51:38 you I would say bump over to that
51:39 episode and enjoy yourself I think it's
51:42 in season three one of the things that I
51:46 think is very interesting is the there's
51:48 a velocity to everything that happens in
51:50 the world of speed at which everything
51:52 happens right velocity is speed and
51:55 vector combined right but which is why
51:59 use velocity because it's so much better
52:00 when you tell your child the Santa Claus
52:03 isn't real okay you are really playing
52:08 with a lot more of your child's psyche
52:11 than I think you realize unless you're
52:14 very astute and then if you're astute
52:17 you won't be surprised by anything I'm
52:19 saying but imagine your child on one
52:22 particular day here's this incredibly
52:24 disappointing news let's just say your
52:26 child never heard the rumor that he
52:28 doesn't exist there's no pre programming
52:30 for the letdown you know what is Santa
52:34 Claus Santa Claus is magic what is magic
52:37 magic is a belief that well you know
52:41 it's sort of a physical hope that that
52:45 magic something that can be conceived of
52:47 by man can occur and it usually results
52:50 in a positive uptick and whatever that
52:52 wherever the magic exists right a
52:54 miracle usually is not someone dying a
52:59 miracle is someone is saved or someone
53:01 is being born all right it's a beautiful
53:02 thing magic is usually always a big
53:04 giant plus sign right so the second you
53:08 tell your child is something doesn't
53:09 exist that's been perceived previously
53:11 as a magical construct you are
53:13 potentially crushing
53:15 the ability for your child to conceive
53:20 of positivity to believe in themselves
53:24 and being able to you know solve for
53:30 what is currently deemed impossible
53:32 because imagine a child that is very
53:34 disappointed about the information about
53:36 Santa Claus right I apologize if I
53:39 repeat this in an episode Santa Claus
53:41 part two but I don't think I'll get a
53:44 hell of a lot of listeners on that if I
53:45 do it but I'll enjoy it but have you
53:50 ever seen a kid throw a tantrum when
53:51 they can't get their way a physical
53:54 tangent they go in their bedroom and
53:56 they start just breaking [ __ ] they do
53:59 whatever they can to be destructive
54:01 because it is a culmination of an
54:04 unbelievable amount of disappointment
54:06 that they have recently been a part of
54:10 and now you tell them that Santa Claus
54:13 doesn't exist and you know I I did I got
54:19 really lucky with my kid that way it all
54:20 came out my kid kind of figured it out
54:22 obviously and that kind of thing but
54:24 imagine inside the mind of the child
54:26 that is hearing this information that
54:27 they want to reject they go inside their
54:31 mind with a sledgehammer and [ __ ]
54:33 destroy anything that is related to
54:35 magic to happiness to hopefulness
54:38 because they never want to get hurt
54:40 again and in doing so they destroy their
54:45 ability to enjoy the world to discover
54:48 things that are undiscovered because
54:51 until something is discovered it seems
54:53 like it's magic isn't it I talked about
54:56 souls a lot on this up on this show
54:58 right well we haven't proven
55:01 scientifically the existence of any
55:03 energy that is not elect electrons that
55:06 would account for a soul in a human body
55:08 the symbiotic relationship of the two
55:10 but of all the scientists when they were
55:14 children obviously super left brain not
55:16 very right brain so they automatically
55:18 almost genetically predisposition to
55:20 being incapable of thinking
55:21 existentially or any sort of
55:24 [Music]
55:26 paranormal way right but of the ones
55:30 that make it through that aperture if
55:32 they have slayed and destroyed all of
55:36 their mental abilities to believe and
55:38 conceive and even postulate look in the
55:41 freaking direction of the unexplained
55:45 guess what that does that drives us
55:48 right back into the control system that
55:49 is nothing more than the sort of myopic
55:52 left brain world it's all about you know
55:54 go get a job get some money do your [ __ ]
55:57 buy all this crap you don't [ __ ] need
55:59 and then die right nothing happens your
56:02 entire life was a trivial journey that
56:04 accomplished nothing
56:06 you better hope reincarnation exists
56:09 right we need to understand that a
56:12 parent telling a child that Santa Claus
56:15 doesn't exist also happens online all
56:18 the time it happens through fakes fake
56:20 news pop science when someone is telling
56:24 you that something is one way or the
56:26 other and we have these these thought
56:28 police people that come around and think
56:30 they're doing more good than harm by
56:33 telling you you if you think like this
56:36 I'm going to personally reject you right
56:39 you're antifa antiph are some [ __ ]
56:42 with the most fascist [ __ ]
56:44 organization on planet earth
56:46 unbelievably the most equivalent
56:48 physical definition and manifestation of
56:50 fascism to ever exist on this planet
56:52 actually has the audacity to call
56:55 themselves an tyfa
56:57 anti-fascism ha ha ha ha how interesting
57:01 is it that the most ignorant people in
57:03 the world will do those kind of things
57:05 but they have had their imagination
57:08 destroy with sledgehammers you know they
57:13 see any adult authoritarian he was
57:16 trying to help them who's already been
57:18 in their shoes who understands how $1.00
57:22 made right that's the funny thing you
57:24 want to have some fun with your your
57:27 friends who are so butthurt about the
57:29 president United States right here's
57:32 what you write in the comments section
57:33 of your YouTube are sorry your Facebook
57:35 feed right you say say you know what
57:40 once you describe to us how a dollars
57:43 made and how it has its value who makes
57:48 it who makes the dollar bill how does it
57:52 gain its value in the world and if you
57:54 can't explain that very simple thing and
57:57 I know economics professors with
57:59 master's degrees okay
58:02 they can't describe it consequently they
58:06 say magic happens at some point right
58:09 but these groups that are truly bullying
58:13 gang stalking groups they are the
58:17 epitome of what they say they fight
58:18 against right they pull if rate the
58:24 internet don't they you know podcast is
58:28 a little bit different a podcast you
58:29 have to put some effort into getting to
58:31 it you have to continue to subscribe to
58:33 it there's a pretty decent regimen of
58:35 playing it on your your listening device
58:38 playing it through your car so it's not
58:40 a real super duper oops I accidentally
58:43 subscribe to a podcast that I hate but
58:45 YouTube is a very can be a very
58:48 accidental thing because of their
58:51 brilliant interface to just search on a
58:53 keyword and find something you could be
58:54 you know landing on the moon is what you
58:57 want to look up but they give you a
58:58 bunch of hoax videos at the end of the
58:59 feat that's not what you want your
59:01 interests didn't the guy landed on the
59:03 moon I think it is interesting that the
59:05 feeds typically do bring up the two
59:07 sides of the coin which you know in a
59:11 debate situation is probably good you do
59:13 have the courage to look at someone else
59:15 telling you that you're wrong i watch
59:18 debunk videos for everything that i say
59:21 is the opposite way you know I watch
59:23 debunk hoax videos for the moon you know
59:26 they tell me how much they went and you
59:29 sit and you watch and then your aren't
59:31 either impressed or you're not impressed
59:33 right I watched a video there the day
59:35 that debunked Flat Earth
59:36 oh my god it was just a few little
59:39 things that completely dispelled it you
59:42 know not that I was hanging on to it at
59:43 all and the funny thing about what's
59:46 happened recently to our channel is that
59:48 I have all these videos where I tell
59:50 people I think it's round
59:51 right I do I think because of expanding
59:54 earth I think it's wrong
59:55 ok how many times I got to say I think
59:57 it's round but I still give a voice to
60:00 the Flat Earth people now I will tell
60:02 you right now for those of you who hang
60:04 on to the FE movement you won't see any
60:06 more fighters videos for me for a while
60:08 simply because the movement isn't going
60:10 anywhere if something changes something
60:12 some big piece of proof comes in and
60:14 Cheryl talk about it it's fine I have to
60:17 make it an hour long I need to make it
60:19 have an angle that is going to make you
60:22 think if I can't accomplish those two
60:25 things something that's interesting and
60:27 makes you think then I'm not going to
60:30 touch it with a ten-foot pole
60:31 if I have my choice right and for those
60:34 of you are wondering why I don't make
60:36 the show rated G or at least PG right
60:41 for me I think that you know broadcasts
60:46 peak as I've said in several episodes
60:48 previous is annoying the way Wolf
60:52 Blitzer talk talks on CNN should scream
60:57 MKULTRA mind control audio you know a
61:02 monotone tone of voice is a brainwashing
61:06 tone of voice and he has nothing more
61:09 than a monotone blowhard MKULTRA dude
61:13 well then he realizes it or not that's
61:15 what he's doing he is like an industrial
61:18 fan of noise spewing [ __ ] you know
61:23 and there's a lot of them there's a ton
61:26 of them then you go all the way to the
61:29 other side and you listen to someone
61:30 like George Noory on coast-to-coast much
61:33 better a lot more pleasant a very
61:36 g-rated show right very friendly sweet
61:39 show to listen to he lets you know
61:42 anyone say anything and he's kind of
61:44 like me I mean I model myself after him
61:46 let's let everyone talk and let's not
61:48 completely you know discount everything
61:52 simply because you know it shocks us
61:54 let's talk about it for me you know when
61:59 I hang out with my friends not all my
62:02 friends talk as poorly as I do in terms
62:04 of
62:05 language but we're real with each other
62:08 right and I think there's a lot of you
62:12 who are real with each other as well and
62:15 I just think that there's a hole there
62:18 there's a there's a hole in the
62:19 programming of information where you
62:22 kind of feel like well this guy talks
62:24 like I do and this you know I only read
62:26 books that are written the way that I
62:28 like to read words only watch shows that
62:30 appeal to me personally and I just think
62:32 that there's I'm living in the mezzanine
62:34 between wolf blitzer's mind control and
62:38 you know George Norris rated G
62:42 information right
62:43 that doesn't mean I'm half mind control
62:45 and by any means but so what's gonna
62:48 happen with YouTube well that's gonna
62:51 happen with YouTube that's the huge
62:53 question right supposedly there's a
62:56 gigantic exodus out of YouTube for a lot
62:59 of folks but I think that for those who
63:01 monetize YouTube and survive off that
63:04 income which man you gotta have I think
63:07 you have to have a million listeners and
63:10 I think that after all ads in front of
63:13 your videos before you can start paying
63:15 the rent on even the smallest apartment
63:17 and that's not us right we are just you
63:23 know I make maybe 10 bucks a month off
63:25 of off any one of the days out of the
63:29 year right there's two things that keep
63:32 our subscriptions I think limited and
63:35 growing in a very slow pace which again
63:39 for me I actually welcoming in one way
63:41 I'd like to see the show get a lot but
63:43 then I know the riffraff would come into
63:46 one is probably the language and two is
63:49 the length of the video and I envy the
63:52 people out there that have the time to
63:55 investigate in and pull out all the
63:58 statistics on a particular thing that
63:59 they're talking about they talk about
64:01 perhaps the drug movement in America and
64:03 man they've they've spent you know a
64:05 couple hours looking up all kinds of DOJ
64:08 drug use statistics and bring it out and
64:11 you know that's why I don't have to do
64:13 it you know my thing is to get down to
64:16 Oh every show that I'm doing here is
64:19 to make it feel like a conversation that
64:21 you and I would have together right so
64:26 back to where is YouTube gonna go I'm
64:27 sorry I digress there nobody knows but I
64:31 think that you're talking about gigantic
64:35 corporations that even if they were
64:39 founded by your cousin or your uncle or
64:44 your grandfather your grandmother or
64:46 whatever they are up for scrutiny
64:51 unlike other things right you and I
64:53 could have a completely crazy
64:55 conversation about reality and no one's
64:57 going to know so no one protests and we
65:00 don't have reporters on our front lawn
65:01 you know taking pictures of us or
65:03 wherever but when you're a giant
65:05 corporation and you do something it's
65:09 typically in the limelight and so you
65:11 got to be careful so content gets
65:13 censored we know that there I think we
65:18 know let me just put that way I think we
65:20 know now that there's definitely been
65:22 some movements to curb the the
65:27 resistance against official stories and
65:29 all arteries of everything right YouTube
65:33 is a private company I mean it's a
65:35 public company stock share wise but it
65:37 is a private company in terms of their
65:40 own policies of what they can do just
65:41 because you go public doesn't mean you
65:43 got to do what the public says right so
65:47 they're gonna do what they want to do
65:48 and we have to simply say well we can
65:51 use a platform up to a certain point now
65:53 here's the here's the sort of
65:55 interesting rub with for YouTube to
65:59 themselves which is this if YouTube were
66:03 to say the next day after this video
66:06 airs they shut down all conspiracy non
66:09 official story videos on their site so
66:11 now they got a magic piece of software
66:13 that pulls that off they just yank all
66:15 of our channels their viewership and
66:17 thus their revenue would plummet
66:20 drastically okay and the only thing that
66:23 they would be doing is creating a
66:25 massive profit opportunity for a
66:27 competitor like vid me right
66:31 they won't do that they can't explain to
66:34 their shareholders why they're yanking a
66:36 gigantic revenue stream and they
66:39 wouldn't want to give away that your
66:40 revenue stream to a competitor that
66:42 having their head out of their ass could
66:45 blow them away by being open minded and
66:48 saying look we do have a first amendment
66:51 of the Constitution which is freedom of
66:52 speech there should not be any
66:55 censorship we may categorize channels
67:00 that are inappropriate for younger
67:01 people because we don't want to screwed
67:03 up Society but in the end they'll take
67:05 all the money so their only game and
67:08 again I don't know that personally I
67:12 haven't had so many bad experiences like
67:16 other folks have had so maybe you know
67:18 from my perspective it's still sunny and
67:19 green and wonderful and tomorrow my
67:21 channel gets penalized for some crazy
67:23 reason and my opinion might change but I
67:30 think at this point the name of the game
67:31 is to essentially curb your as a YouTube
67:36 channel creator it's to curb your
67:39 willingness to take a risk on an episode
67:42 if you move out there and say oh 9/11 is
67:45 an inside job well they're gonna they
67:47 definitely knock out all of your revenue
67:49 I have a soda on cigars and it can't
67:52 make money because they have taken the
67:55 bias that cigars are like cigarettes and
67:57 they caused huge health problems so just
67:59 having cigars in the title of the video
68:02 violates their policies right okay and I
68:05 don't I don't have any Buttered about
68:06 that but the other side of the game
68:09 would be let's just say youtube's
68:12 executives come in and say look man we
68:14 don't want to personally have hate mail
68:18 on our doorstep and we don't want to
68:21 have some psycho who has a channel that
68:24 before we shut it down the guy was
68:25 making you know ten thousand dollars a
68:28 month and now we made him homeless and
68:30 so he bought a gun with his last ten
68:32 grand he stands out in the parking lot
68:34 and starts blowing away our employees we
68:36 don't want either one of those problems
68:37 so if you want to do all this globalist
68:40 censorship you're gonna have to
68:43 indemnify us
68:44 meaning make it not our fault and so
68:48 that's where the TPP was headed the
68:52 trans-pacific partnership which is the
68:54 completely globalized the world and make
68:57 it it's literally the first step into
68:58 the narrative of the fictional movie
69:00 rollerball from 1975 give the
69:05 corporation's all power on what can be
69:07 spoken in public surrendering the First
69:10 Amendment to attorneys basically that
69:13 can rough you up forever and so TPP got
69:17 turned off by Trump no one gives them
69:20 any credit for that except the Trump
69:22 supporters but if that if that had gone
69:25 through then again they could come and
69:27 get anyone who talks about a particular
69:30 corporation you want to talk about about
69:31 GMOs and Monsanto and glyphosate you
69:35 know it's not that you can't prove that
69:37 it does these things but they'll pay off
69:39 the the judges to make your evidence not
69:42 admissible in court and you'll just hang
69:45 by sure circumstantial evidence right
69:48 fake studies and things that you can't
69:50 afford to counteract right so they're
69:53 gonna try to create if they want to do
69:55 this policies that are global I can for
69:58 instance right would come in and from
70:01 some European authorities group and say
70:04 that they we don't allow this and then
70:06 YouTube will pull all the channels and
70:09 pull all the videos and literally send
70:11 you an apology and go look it's not our
70:12 fault it's it's this global policy
70:15 contact your congressmen right so be
70:20 aware of that algorithm for one what's
70:23 interesting is is that they have this
70:24 weird policy that if you supposedly have
70:28 certain type of content that certain
70:30 advertisers won't allow you to advertise
70:33 on YouTube you know you won't be able to
70:35 embed them in your in your videos what's
70:37 really pathetic about this whole
70:40 assertion is is that what we talk about
70:42 on this show so I've talked about cigars
70:44 you know I said I have an episode life
70:47 before 9/11 and they they knock that out
70:50 because I put 9/11 in there right I
70:53 could be talking about you know a police
70:56 service that's 9/11 I could be
70:57 about my birthday on 9/11 and make it
71:00 the most incredible story but because it
71:01 has that and in the title there D
71:04 monetizing the video but I have found
71:07 videos that have full pre-roll ads okay
71:11 those are the most lucrative ads they
71:12 pre well they're knowing his [ __ ] which
71:14 is why I don't put them on my videos
71:15 anymore
71:15 I tried them on a few of the real
71:17 popular videos but then I finally just
71:19 decided I don't like them and I don't
71:20 want to put those in front of the
71:22 listeners right but I have seen videos
71:25 on there of guys that go into bathrooms
71:31 and they they lock themselves in a stall
71:33 like three fairly buff kids right they
71:37 go into the store and they simulate
71:40 masturbating in the stalls and then
71:44 their spunk shooting on the feet of
71:49 people next to them they're using like
71:50 glue and they're using some you know
71:52 stuff that looks like it and therefore
71:54 running full ads in front of it as if
71:56 any advertiser wants to be associated
71:59 with that they also have fake turds that
72:02 they throw on people's feet you know
72:05 there's a set of women that did it and
72:07 they were throwing used what looks like
72:10 used tampons which they're using you
72:12 know sort of you know fake blood from
72:15 some prop store or ketchup or whatever
72:17 and they're throwing them on people's
72:19 feet and these people are vomiting
72:21 sometimes when they see these things
72:23 touch them and it hits their shoes and
72:25 destroys their property and they're
72:27 monetizing it and YouTube has no problem
72:30 giving them full role full full pre-roll
72:33 ads right so that's that's the
72:36 indication that at a minimum their
72:39 system is not efficient at all it could
72:43 also show could show that there's
72:45 extreme bias against anything that's
72:47 attempting to wake you up you could have
72:51 your own opinion about what that is but
72:55 I've seen that and it doesn't make any
72:57 sense
72:59 now I have personally I mean I'm not
73:01 trying to kiss up but I'm gonna tell you
73:02 guys when I contacted YouTube folks to
73:06 reverse some of the deep monetization
73:09 complaints about a video
73:10 it's like two hours and the videos
73:12 totally monetizable they really have
73:16 shown me a lot of love so I don't know
73:19 guys I haven't I haven't seen it yet you
73:21 know and you would think that if you
73:24 point out something like he you know
73:26 people are saying my videos are bad so
73:29 bad that it can't have any ads that
73:31 they'll look deeper into your channel
73:32 right I mean almost have petitioned some
73:35 [ __ ] went to all my videos and click
73:37 them all you know or don't you know this
73:38 guy's got bad [ __ ] in his videos and and
73:42 I clicked the whole thing please reverse
73:44 it and the automated system works great
73:45 just rolls a mountain but it's like drug
73:49 drug dealers are very famous for putting
73:52 the the Dare stickers the Dare bumper
73:54 stickers on their cars which is you know
73:56 dear something against drugs or
73:58 something like that to get kids off
74:01 drugs so they pretend to be law-abiding
74:04 citizens but they're moving you know
74:06 kilos or whatever the hell they're
74:07 selling right YouTube is a brilliant
74:10 experiment like I said and what it
74:13 should do is not only alarm you to
74:16 what's happening on YouTube personally
74:19 but everything else you've been
74:20 ingesting your whole life
74:23 television and film newspapers and
74:26 magazines and anything you watch on
74:28 normal television where people claim to
74:30 be scientists and they'll tell you
74:32 what's one way and there couldn't be any
74:33 other way
74:34 I mean what's what drew me into science
74:36 as a child was that you know to become a
74:40 scientist it's become a pioneer of
74:42 reality a pioneer physical reality a
74:45 pioneer of existential reality depending
74:47 on what Sciences you go into you can go
74:49 into a mall you know but now that
74:54 algorithm is trying to be undone don't
74:57 think anymore don't think anymore that's
74:59 how they say it this shows about the
75:01 antithesis of that right think think and
75:05 hey you know what if you know what's
75:08 really [ __ ] strange is that the guy
75:10 that came at me the two dudes that came
75:12 at me and really were just trying to
75:14 read me the riot act and trying to
75:16 against wrong army with their one sub to
75:19 capitulate to their belief systems they
75:22 said they listened to a ton of videos
75:24 and I always say in videos part about
75:26 every five videos I at least say at once
75:28 which is hey if I make you uncomfortable
75:31 with my beliefs the beautiful thing is
75:34 I'm strengthening your beliefs and that
75:38 may sound like a cop-out to some of you
75:41 but it's absolutely not a cop-out it's a
75:45 reality but now let's finish with one
75:49 other concept here if someone had asked
75:52 me in 1982 the best year in Hollywood
75:56 film to ever exist in history is anyone
76:01 ever gonna get tired to go into the
76:02 movies
76:05 what's 1982 it's 35 years ago okay
76:13 2017 is the worst grossing year of
76:18 Hollywood since 2006 and before I
76:21 believe it's the mid-90s had a bad year
76:23 like 96 or something like that they have
76:25 seen gross revenues in film drop 17%
76:31 we've talked about the list a little bit
76:33 on the on the show before movie theaters
76:36 have gotten much better I think some of
76:39 the experience has gotten better the
76:41 projectors have gotten better the sound
76:42 system certainly have just nailed it you
76:45 don't need any more innovation and sound
76:46 in a movie theater I mean that's
76:48 tongue-in-cheek but you know I was
76:51 working on a format that would change
76:53 movie theaters and make everyone go back
76:55 in for a while there I don't know how
76:58 long YouTube has let's just say they do
77:02 everything right YouTube could also
77:05 change like amazon.com for those of you
77:09 young whippersnappers who were babies
77:11 when that service came out in 1993 they
77:14 used to sell just books how was their
77:17 main thing just books and then they
77:19 started realizing Jesus we have this
77:21 amazing shipping infrastructure we're
77:25 gonna sell everything and then they blew
77:27 up it's amazing right so they came out a
77:31 bookstore online then they became
77:32 something amazing that's why the logo is
77:34 A to Z right
77:36 YouTube well let's put this go back one
77:39 more example before we stop here Yahoo
77:41 who really was the first name brand
77:44 search engine company you used to
77:47 specialize in search now you can still
77:49 go there and search on things but who
77:50 the hell has a browser dialed into Yahoo
77:53 almost nobody right so either Google or
77:56 Bing that's it Yahoo's been turned into
77:59 a Content company and that's what
78:03 they're gonna go out of business YouTube
78:06 could get rid of all user participant
78:11 random videos and go to user approved
78:14 channels where they you have to petition
78:16 your channel into YouTube and a staff of
78:19 people examine your charter examine
78:22 every video that comes out maybe even
78:25 have to pay for it maybe there's a rev
78:27 share going on and they turn into
78:29 another network cable channel but it's
78:32 online like Netflix they certainly have
78:35 the infrastructure to host any video
78:37 that they want right they can serve for
78:39 KVR or whatever the hell comes around
78:41 they could put the new Star Wars movie
78:42 on YouTube just only on YouTube right
78:46 have fun because you can run it on your
78:48 TV for Christ's sake hell they could
78:50 have projectors and movie theaters that
78:52 run it right now because of the DCI
78:54 certifications they won't do that but
78:56 but the pattern of YouTube is going to
78:59 wane I think it already has Wayne one of
79:03 the more interesting searches you can do
79:04 on the Internet as a little piece of
79:06 homework is look up death of social
79:09 media look that up and look at all these
79:12 name-brand rags that are trying to well
79:16 they're basically studying the demise of
79:19 social media the fact that the gen Z
79:21 kids don't want to have anything to do
79:23 with it you do a little bit of Instagram
79:26 because it's just a photograph of what
79:27 they're doing you put a little sentence
79:29 in there but they avoid all the politics
79:30 all the [ __ ] what's Instagram what I
79:34 have found Instagram to be is almost
79:37 unanimously a non political platform
79:39 it's just your life platform what you do
79:42 today
79:42 yeah you do get pictures of food in
79:45 people's faces and whatever right it's
79:47 just a fun little thing to say I was
79:49 I'm doing this today hope you enjoy
79:53 being on my journey with me it's kind of
79:55 cool right I think most of you hardcore
79:58 youtubers understand that we're moving
80:00 at light speed right now in terms of the
80:04 evolution of the Internet as being
80:06 manipulated by a lot of forces but
80:09 because it is an open flat platform and
80:11 we don't have internet 2.0 which was
80:13 really super duper rumored to be coming
80:15 about it in year 2000 which is really
80:19 funny there's a whole group that has
80:22 been developing this sort of internet
80:23 2.0 you know it was just released that
80:27 NASA has an internet that they use that
80:31 is 30,000 times faster than the fastest
80:34 internet that you can get in your house
80:36 I put 300 megabits in my house which
80:39 lets me download about 30 Meg per second
80:42 off of a cable 20 millisecond off of 5g
80:45 internet connection so take 300 megabits
80:49 and multiply it times 30,000 like nine
80:54 million Jesus yeah some we got it's it
81:00 would be as if you could transfer you
81:02 know a gigabit drive at it one terabyte
81:05 drive and nearly a second just boom
81:08 except the drive can't read its own
81:09 information that quickly but imagine
81:11 that it's fast so you're writing a bowl
81:18 if you're in this sort of cutting-edge I
81:22 wouldn't say it's bleeding-edge anymore
81:24 because the technology is very sound
81:25 nowadays but this cutting-edge platform
81:28 that is a YouTube platform a Facebook
81:32 platform Instagram platform whatever
81:36 unlike all my other subjects where you
81:39 may or may not be involved in a
81:40 particular subject matter this video is
81:43 something that addresses something
81:44 you're interested in unless you're
81:46 somehow capable of finding this show
81:48 purely through a podcast which I guess
81:50 is possible through iTunes or Google
81:51 Play if you're a youtuber and you're
81:55 watching this through YouTube however
81:56 you do it then you can comment down
81:59 below about sort of your belief systems
82:02 your concerns
82:03 have a discussion about like what your
82:05 worries are what you think are the
82:08 trends what you've seen personally try
82:11 to measure the rumors that you've heard
82:13 because again I hear rumors all the time
82:16 a channels getting canceled and
82:17 suspended and you know unless it's
82:20 concluded by the time I'm notified those
82:23 channels have not been turned off nor
82:25 have the author's made any videos about
82:27 being turned off what you would think
82:30 would be the case right we know people
82:32 get cancelled all the time but you're
82:35 usually [ __ ] starting some pretty
82:36 heavy-duty concepts right well help you
82:40 fill me on this one deep thoughts radio
82:43 comm for all the feeds there's video if
82:45 you're an audio there's audio if you're
82:47 on video your video options are YouTube
82:49 and Vimeo which I'm hearing a lot of
82:51 other folks talk about now which I'm
82:53 very happy I moved over a year ago your
82:56 audio is iTunes and Google Play Plus you
82:59 can just hit deep thoughts radio calm
83:00 with your mobile device and hit the RSS
83:02 feed and it will attach to your podcast
83:05 reader if you're on Android I use
83:08 podcast edit you know it's really funny
83:10 I just realized I've mentioned that up
83:11 several times on the show I have no
83:15 affiliation with them whatsoever it's
83:16 just they have as a developer myself I
83:19 can definitely tell you they update that
83:20 app all the time to improve the features
83:23 it's stunning it's like once a week so
83:26 52 updates a year almost I mean they are
83:29 really serious about that album so the
83:32 other one is that we have a lock to
83:34 Facebook group so that just has a great
83:37 flow of folks in there some really good
83:38 kind people who are chatting back and
83:41 forth and again we've had a couple folks
83:43 slip in and get really really angry you
83:45 know again people have tolerated me
83:49 being very angry so I'll tolerate those
83:51 two I'm not kicking anyone off the
83:53 channel just because they they hate on
83:56 me or whatever I think that the only
83:59 thing that actually has ever made me
84:01 remove someone from the channel man that
84:03 hasn't happened in a very long time I
84:05 think I've kicked anyone off the channel
84:07 for a year if not more is if they
84:10 habitually post negative comments that
84:15 have no
84:16 you know they're not disputing anything
84:19 in the video they're just you know
84:21 having you know the runs through their
84:23 mouths the other one is we've had people
84:29 that just don't know the etiquette of
84:31 commenting on videos and so I mention
84:35 this long time ago one guy came in on
84:37 the moon hoax video about a year and a
84:38 half ago and he must have posted I don't
84:42 know 30 40 comments on the video but
84:45 just as he's watching and he just keeps
84:46 posting and posting and posting and
84:49 unfortunately with YouTube comments
84:51 you're not able to easily insert assets
84:54 so be nice as an administrator of a
84:57 particular channel like me if I could
85:00 post an image as a reply that would be
85:02 awesome because these people this guy
85:04 was like there's no square when to turn
85:05 around windows on the Apollo 11 capsule
85:08 you know go look at the lock Facebook
85:10 group I posted the texture of the round
85:12 window it's in the blast hatch the
85:16 actual frame is around rectangle and but
85:20 in it is the window that's round right
85:22 so idiots they can't just do basic stuff
85:26 and come in you know they're really
85:27 silly you know I'll let that guy go for
85:31 a long time but Jesus every time I went
85:32 back to the feet it was like 10 more
85:34 comments and then ten more comments I
85:36 was like oh my god so those are just a
85:39 couple of the times that I've ever pull
85:41 anyone out of the channel so and you
85:42 can't you can't unsubscribe them you
85:44 just mute them and they tend to kind of
85:47 disappear so anyhow if you made it this
85:51 far thanks for listening take care of
85:54 yourself in someone else and I will see
85:55 you in the next YouTube video over
85:59 [Music]
