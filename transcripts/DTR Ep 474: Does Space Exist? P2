00:29 good morning good afternoon good evening
00:32 ladies and gentlemen man I never thought
00:35 I'd make 90% of the episodes at night
00:37 this year just this winter's been
00:40 ridiculously cold and the days have just
00:44 been it's been gross so this is when I
00:48 got the time when it's 52 degrees
00:51 outside as you can see this gonna be
00:54 about the existence of space after you
01:00 hardcore listeners you know there was an
01:02 episode already on this it was called
01:06 this the space exists I pretty sure it's
01:10 season one because there was a bit of an
01:13 overlap between him kilcher radio
01:16 recordings and this show because the
01:19 whole thing popped out of the thing that
01:23 I always say that I did I realized that
01:25 I dream of all kinds of stuff men had a
01:29 super lucid dream last night oh my god
01:32 but I realized that even having me just
01:37 butcher the human language here the
01:40 English language a human English
01:43 language despite being a sci-fi junkie
01:49 now I don't want you absolutely
01:50 everything like if the show sucks I
01:53 won't watch it but you know all the
01:55 classics meant all the Star Wars all the
01:57 Star Trek's you know Star Trek I would
02:01 say I've watched them all two to five
02:03 times it's every episode it's just
02:08 anything I'm not I'm sure there's quite
02:10 a few of you out there really like
02:11 science fiction stuff all the little one
02:14 off movies and all that kind of stuff
02:15 despite being very into that genre I
02:22 realized that I have never ever dreamed
02:26 of being in space I've never dreamed of
02:29 being on a spaceship being us x-wing
02:33 fighter a y-wing fighter
02:36 just I haven't even dreamed of being on
02:38 the Death Star
02:39 I haven't dreamed of being at any one of
02:43 the locations in Star Trek from the
02:47 Vulcan planets to thee would probably
02:51 not wanna dream about being on the
02:53 Klingon planets but the Romulans
02:57 Franky's Bajoran for join any one of
03:01 those none of the enterprise ships not
03:05 teach space tonight and you know so I
03:11 asked Kyle my buddy Kyle he's got two
03:13 Emmys for science fiction based
03:17 special-effects stuff he worked on Star
03:20 Trek way back in the 90s was a really
03:23 young lad but he got a job with the guy
03:25 that and was doing all the special
03:26 effects for Babylon 5 you know he's done
03:30 all of Battlestar Galactica which is
03:32 where he got one of the Emmys and the
03:35 other one was the Firefly movie and I
03:41 said you know dude you live inside
03:43 cameras in a virtual world setting up
03:46 all the shots for space stuff have you
03:49 ever had a dream and he stood there for
03:51 a second he goes no how's it possible oh
03:57 yeah so he went to work the next day
03:59 asked everyone he works with I mean some
04:03 of these dudes would do this for 40
04:05 years nope nope nope nope nope nope not
04:08 a single person in his office we asked
04:12 other people
04:12 no one how is it that I've dreamed about
04:17 being in a bunch of weird places but
04:21 never in space well that's something
04:23 that I would absolutely love to do if
04:25 it's something in my mind right I'm
04:27 supposed to dream it I could play a
04:28 World of Warcraft for three hours and
04:30 the definitely being this like questing
04:32 archetypal themed dream usually racks my
04:37 sleep so then I thought okay is it just
04:41 that I haven't been there so I can't
04:45 dream about it which would actually
04:47 reveal something very interesting about
04:48 dreaming
04:50 I'll give you an example as a kid when I
04:55 was a baby you know little blue boy my
04:58 parents took me all over Europe now I
05:01 don't think I have any memories of that
05:03 I definitely couldn't tell you about
05:05 being in Paris or being in munitia or
05:09 whatever but I was I was in always I was
05:12 in Berlin as a kid you know it was like
05:14 I've been around I've also been in
05:17 England three times hmm Minna Sydney
05:21 once so the idea is I don't dream about
05:24 those places either but I've been there
05:28 so is there something about proximity
05:31 the controls are dreaming but it's a
05:34 very famous phrase I get right now I get
05:38 it like almost a Tourette's comment you
05:42 know if I if I made a video about moving
05:46 furniture in my front room and I talked
05:49 about the space between my sofa and the
05:52 coffee table and the space between my
05:54 coffee table
05:55 and my TV some numbnuts gonna [ __ ]
05:58 reply space doesn't exist huh
06:02 depends full it's like relax man relax
06:07 make a bigger point than this goddamn
06:10 cliche responds it keeps going all over
06:13 the place again this is deep thoughts
06:16 not just thoughts okay
06:18 it's Tourette's it's like you've got
06:21 something that falls into the forefront
06:23 of your mind and you just will you just
06:24 say it and that's one of the things that
06:27 Americans do it's really embarrassing
06:29 sometimes and sometimes it can be
06:30 extremely funny but this idea that we
06:33 don't incubate a single molecule of our
06:37 thought process before we just blurt it
06:38 out now some countries like England God
06:43 bless all my British friends sometimes
06:46 some of the older generation could sit
06:48 there forever trying to think about what
06:50 the hell they're gonna say and you get
06:52 it all over the place where you get
06:53 someone who's really the thinking about
06:59 what they're gonna say you know it just
07:00 gets
07:01 my god dude just take a poop already and
07:05 relax and just start speaking from the
07:07 soul and you won't have to worry about
07:09 bullshitting someone or picking the
07:11 wrong words that's a little digression
07:15 on communication protocol Douglas Adams
07:19 in his last two books of the
07:22 Hitchhiker's got at the galaxy which was
07:23 then after the BBC series was turning
07:27 into two books he ended up writing those
07:29 two books because Adam and wrote another
07:31 two books they got any Dirk Maggs you
07:35 know I had the privilege of
07:36 communicating with and hiring his sound
07:38 guy one of his song guys paul weir for
07:42 my video game company he went and
07:45 reprised the other two when i repriced
07:47 he ended up doing the other two books so
07:49 three and four and there's a beautiful
07:52 you just listen to it man I don't
07:56 remember this cuz I don't think I
07:57 actually read the last two books I
07:59 thought I did but I didn't think my dad
08:02 read them and I thought he told me about
08:04 him order because my father and I read
08:05 the first couple books together like out
08:09 loud to each other which is cooler on
08:10 some trip together
08:11 to the floor room but anyway there was a
08:15 race in this story of his and again
08:20 Douglas Adams is probably I don't know
08:23 man the guy was sort of an alien he's
08:27 more than just a genius he just seemed
08:29 to man just grasp the entire universe I
08:35 mean not of metaphor he put together
08:37 that is sort of biblical you know that
08:40 the reusable metaphor you can use to
08:43 think about things and I'm gonna use it
08:45 right now it was just seemingly
08:48 inexhaustible and he thought it I think
08:51 a death like a heart attack or something
08:52 really young superset
08:55 he was always proud that his initials
08:57 for DNA cool I can't remember what his
09:00 middle name was anyway
09:02 he developed this race on this planet
09:06 that for whatever reason had never
09:08 looked up they didn't acknowledge up and
09:13 then
09:15 I think it was Ford and Arthur Dent for
09:17 prefect and Arthur Dent who land on the
09:19 planet I think and they didn't know
09:23 where they came from because they were
09:26 like well we came from up there and
09:27 they're like well what's up there and
09:30 this was a race that sang songs to each
09:32 other was really funny which was at the
09:35 aborigine do that they sing their
09:38 history to each other they sing when
09:40 they speak is the most beautiful thing
09:42 that I hadn't seen until my late 40s
09:45 because I think very few people have
09:47 recorded it but it got me thinking a
09:52 race that doesn't look up someone
09:55 someone so when someone says space
09:58 doesn't exist hmm it's not like we're
10:01 all sitting there gone that's heresy you
10:04 know but what gives us the impression
10:09 that it exists and then what is
10:12 everything else that's gonna be my theme
10:16 in this particular episode so you know
10:21 there's there's a couple schools of
10:24 thought here and this is we're gonna
10:27 parse this a little bit
10:28 there are flat earthers and their global
10:31 Globus now your Globus they
10:35 automatically typically believe in space
10:38 because they're NASA disciples again an
10:41 organization that has lied almost every
10:43 single day that it's been in existence
10:45 is feeding people their basis in reality
10:48 I happen to think it's the globe because
10:52 bubbles and water are round and ether is
10:56 like water and we are like the plasma
10:58 ball except it's water it's excuse me
11:01 it's oxygen inside of a bubbly substance
11:04 right it's a default shape I believe is
11:09 what was a Vivian Cooper till yeah
11:13 whoever said it I love that that idea
11:16 then you have the other school of
11:17 thought which is it if it's a flat earth
11:21 now I just read an article I've been
11:24 searching all over the place to see if
11:25 someone can kind of catalyze me into the
11:27 next
11:28 I'm still working on the Tesla death ray
11:31 information and I've suddenly realized
11:34 there's a little digression here that
11:35 the amount of true information about
11:37 that invention is very very sparse you
11:41 search on YouTube and it's a joke if you
11:45 have these numbskulls so creating this
11:47 really super bad or scanning reality
11:50 show or they're faking their surprise
11:52 and they're faking everything is really
11:54 interesting and monumental or you get
11:57 these one-minute videos one and a half
11:59 minute videos and the [ __ ] have the
12:01 audacity or roll credits for 20 seconds
12:03 you're like dude you talk for like one
12:05 minute and you have 24 seconds
12:07 afterwards it's like cameraman producer
12:09 and it's like [ __ ] off seriously yeah
12:12 you're not gonna know the part there mr.
12:14 [ __ ] Steven Spielberg probably get a
12:19 nice dose of profanity either way you
12:22 have a big picture 2020 cooking in my
12:24 office right now
12:25 rendering okay so you think it's flat
12:29 earth and you know the fire thing is
12:32 utterly died Oh died out it doesn't mean
12:35 that anyone's belief systems have
12:37 changed it's just that the there's no
12:39 new evidence there's no new stuff and I
12:42 understand it's very difficult to do
12:43 it's hard to start your own space agency
12:46 to figure this out they have gaghe
12:49 Antarctica travel so you can't go down
12:51 there and take a look and they gagged
12:54 airspace plus it cost hundreds of
12:57 millions of dollars to do anything you
12:59 know over a few miles up what we get we
13:06 get about what 22 miles up with just
13:08 regular devices where the balloons and
13:11 that kind of stuff but the battle
13:13 between a flat earther and a globe or
13:18 aside from the evidence you know
13:22 assessments right people think they see
13:24 certain things and they do where they
13:26 don't you know you're not seeing around
13:28 earth in a plane okay you don't see the
13:31 curvature of the earth in a plane the
13:35 guy that went up in the Red Bull thing
13:38 and jumped out everything he shot up
13:41 there
13:41 a total fish I like what's wrong which
13:44 is bringing a regular landscape camera
13:46 why do the fisheye or at least bring one
13:50 and then you can do all your you know
13:51 GoPros after that because they're always
13:54 trying to forge the notion this place is
13:56 round and Here I am a guy believes it's
14:00 rent it I may not believe it's the
14:06 traditional thing but anyway my belief
14:09 doesn't really matter in this episode
14:10 but the the flat earthers will typically
14:17 create a sort of a reservoir that says
14:21 NASA is trying to kill God I just read
14:25 some article that was talking about how
14:26 we're not on Mars and we're not but
14:30 their whole emphasis was that NASA is
14:33 trying to kill God and so I'm sitting
14:37 there going maybe I guess but I mean how
14:41 could that I don't know I mean I think
14:44 you I guess your nanyat down slowly over
14:46 time it's like you've got a hatchet and
14:48 you're trying to chop down the biggest
14:49 redwood tree in muir woods or something
14:53 I you know it's that's huge and plus
14:55 what you chopped down will grow back a
14:57 little bit so it's I don't really see
15:00 how that's a direct correlation what God
15:05 can't create space absurd is that do we
15:09 have such a narcissistic weak impression
15:15 of ourselves that God is not allowed to
15:17 create another puppy dog in the house
15:20 right it's like we're the puppy dog and
15:22 someone else brought another puppy dog
15:24 or we're the worth of grown up dog and
15:26 what God's not allowed to bring your
15:27 puppy in because then our attentions
15:30 ours right that noise I just made it
15:34 annoys you that's what I feel like when
15:36 someone's trying to say there's no
15:38 aliens and out there there's nothing out
15:41 there God can't do anything but pay
15:42 attention completely does I find that
15:45 logic just so incredibly incredibly
15:50 selfish immature
15:54 and flawed okay
15:57 now the solution may not have anything
15:59 to do with that black stuff we see up
16:02 there with this sparkling net up there
16:04 but it's like when someone says that
16:06 gravity doesn't exist okay dude all we
16:11 are calling the definition of gravity
16:14 before science is that if you drop [ __ ]
16:17 it falls down that's what we're calling
16:20 gravity so don't tell me that doesn't
16:22 [ __ ] exist man
16:23 okay the theory of its complete [ __ ]
16:26 because ethers been erased from the
16:27 universe but meaning our planet right
16:30 we're not allowed to believe it in so
16:34 many contextual ways of looking at it
16:37 right but when I look up I see a
16:41 blackness at night if I'm out in the
16:44 middle of nowhere like Havasu Lake I'm
16:46 seeing the most incredible beautiful I'm
16:51 about 1200 stars I'm seeing this Milky
16:56 Way just wrapped right down the middle
16:58 looks chaotic to me doesn't look like
17:01 the electric light parade at Disneyland
17:04 now California Park that's where they
17:08 run that parade now so something is up
17:14 there
17:16 because there seems to be some space
17:20 between the top of my head and those
17:24 hanging orbs up there I call it space
17:29 now whether or not it's a firmament dome
17:32 with spheres up there glowing plasma our
17:36 moderator Dave again Dave you guys start
17:40 taking more of those shots because
17:41 they're just phenomenal
17:42 but he has this amazing zoom lens and it
17:44 gets up there and he films I'm assuming
17:47 out of his backyard or something stars
17:49 with this camera
17:51 he'll Paul the way back and push all the
17:53 way in so you can see where you are and
17:55 it's like this glowing plasma like
17:58 Mohawks and all kinds of stuff on these
18:00 spheres and if you think it's anomaly of
18:03 the camera
18:05 well he's shaking the camera because he
18:07 can't hold something
18:08 completely still a 100 zoom right and
18:10 the Mohawks stay attached to the sphere
18:15 if you think it's an anomaly of the
18:17 atmosphere well it doesn't make any
18:19 sense because again these Mohawk things
18:21 that he has films stay attached to the
18:23 sphere so even as he's shaken the camera
18:25 they're right there just like someone
18:28 just put a plasma Mohawk right down the
18:30 center of their head well the atmosphere
18:31 would most likely be moving and shaking
18:34 if it's a firm room at Dome and you
18:36 think you're looking through water water
18:38 would be moving have you ever seen an
18:40 anomaly in a pool the reflections in a
18:42 pool just stay there now they're
18:45 constantly moving and shaking because
18:46 it's liquid all right
18:49 so with seeing that between us and what
18:51 Dave is filming it counts like a it
18:54 might be a true I don't know I don't
18:59 wanna say vacuum because we have an
19:01 atmosphere the whole thing about again
19:08 you know it's funny I have a buddy in
19:11 mind that will he's a flat earther and
19:17 he'll try to tell a friend why you know
19:20 little proofs but the one he says is
19:23 like well how could you hold the
19:24 atmosphere or two arounds ball wouldn't
19:27 it just dissipate if you had a vacuum
19:29 outside this sphere
19:31 how could you hold an atmosphere to a
19:34 ball well I've told him a thousand times
19:38 what ether is I've told him a thousand
19:41 times there is no true vacuum in space
19:45 it's this stuff called ether because the
19:51 sphere of plasma at the center of the
19:54 earth in the center of all celestial
19:56 bodies blocks either absolutes or blocks
20:01 the overwhelming majority of ether that
20:04 would be passing through the earth you
20:07 will then create even in a computer
20:09 simulation you will create a push down
20:13 to the surface of the earth from random
20:17 chaotic winds of space hitting the
20:19 sphere but because we have
20:22 Allen belt which is the orbital
20:25 electrons right you get dielectric way
20:28 bouncing off this plasma core and you've
20:31 got stuff that missed the earth as it
20:33 was you know coming towards it but
20:35 because it's blocking it's creating
20:37 negative pressure that's how the
20:39 atmosphere is held to a sphere okay it's
20:44 sort of like saying how could a bubble
20:45 exist in water because men water is a
20:50 pressure the pushes on this sphere of
20:53 air and it's pushing from all sides have
20:58 you ever had a beer here's a good test
21:00 for your brain
21:01 you got a beer my soda but beers better
21:04 cuz you can see through it right maybe a
21:06 7up huh you havin Cola right have you
21:10 ever looked inside one of those glasses
21:11 and seeing bubbles that aren't spheres I
21:15 mean you might have like an egg-shaped
21:16 one first one second have you ever seen
21:19 one that's shaped like stars like a five
21:22 pointed star how about one that shaped
21:24 like a toothpick one is shaped like a
21:26 doughnut with a hole in the middle
21:28 no because the base physics that hold
21:33 this whole place together starts at the
21:35 ether level the smallest particle in the
21:37 universe and constitutes itself up to
21:41 the bubble in the water I'm trying to
21:46 undo your knee-jerk reaction if you're
21:48 one of these newcomers that's never
21:49 heard these arguments before it's not a
21:54 proof maybe it's a proof you don't
21:57 understand you're talking about but yeah
22:00 but let's just say we got a couple of
22:03 ways we can go about this that are at
22:04 least giant ways of doing it if the
22:07 official story of the earth is not true
22:11 meaning NASA's impression of the whole
22:14 thing which by the way millions of
22:18 people thought it was the way NASA
22:19 thought it was before NASA ever existed
22:21 so just understand yes I understand that
22:24 the Flat Earth theory was the way we
22:27 thought of the earth prior around five
22:28 hundred and fifty years ago but if you
22:31 really research things again even the
22:33 Egyptians they're signed for you
22:36 is a circle with an empty space in the
22:41 middle which is the Sun meaning in orbit
22:43 around the Sun was one year and then
22:46 they are symbol for the moon or for the
22:48 month is a circle filled in which could
22:51 either be the moon or could be earth and
22:53 that's you know the circles these people
22:55 from outer space just tell you we're
22:56 probably from outer space and I don't
22:59 know if the inability to dream of this
23:01 region has anything to do with what I
23:04 was talking about in a previous episode
23:06 about the intelligence threshold
23:11 we're not simple we're not allowed to
23:13 have thoughts that think our way out of
23:17 this reality right meaning the
23:19 characters in the book are not allowed
23:21 to think about themselves existing
23:23 outside of the pages in the book we're
23:25 not allowed to know how this place is
23:28 put together and it's not like that's a
23:31 prison it's because it may end up
23:36 destroying everything for us
23:38 the beauty of this world that's been
23:41 created wouldn't be a bummer to find out
23:46 that that it really is just this
23:48 existence without having it explained to
23:51 you how the matrix works again if you
23:55 found the the the dome wall I think that
24:00 there would be almost a subliminal theme
24:02 in your heart that would say well my
24:06 belief in God is either gonna be there
24:07 with fear or it's gonna be there with a
24:10 flutter so it really doesn't you know
24:12 it's never gonna take away your belief
24:14 in a creator that's something you hold
24:16 within you if you have it and if you
24:17 don't you don't and I meet it you know a
24:20 comment about atheists and just the
24:23 experience I had when I was younger I
24:25 want to make a distinction if you're a
24:27 happy a theist then any comments I mean
24:30 in the past about some of the atheists
24:33 that I know that are just so just
24:36 unhappy with being atheist you know it
24:39 was like they're just angry you know if
24:41 that's not you know I'm not talking
24:43 about you
24:44 and I think there's more people that are
24:46 content with it than anything else
24:49 overwhelming majority but if you really
24:52 found out that we're in a petri dish in
24:54 you really could conceive of how tiny it
24:57 is because the world's gonna seem huge
24:59 until you find out there's borders
25:00 around it and a dome overhead now maybe
25:04 at that point you assume oh my god there
25:08 really is just us and God is completely
25:10 paying attention to us
25:13 is that really gonna make you super
25:15 happy I mean don't you think that's the
25:17 case regardless of what shape the earth
25:19 is I do but imagine now you want to have
25:24 a life that has choice now when you look
25:30 up you're really kind of seeing God's
25:31 eyeball looking right at you and now
25:35 it's like oh my god if you go obsessed
25:37 with it you might be in a realm where
25:40 you you self-destruct mentally because
25:43 you know you're sinning according to
25:46 whatever religion you're believing in at
25:47 the time and you know just being looked
25:53 at constantly nobody likes being stared
25:56 at by someone that they don't know and
26:00 you don't know God nobody knows God
26:05 right I mean maybe some crazy people do
26:07 but we can assume but what God might be
26:11 like a guy could be a computer doesn't
26:15 even care just exist
26:17 you're never gonna die so don't worry
26:20 about it just keep going in circles this
26:23 reality is all you got man so enjoy it
26:24 don't try to figure out too much because
26:27 then you'll lose the magic of the world
26:29 the mystery of the world but let's say
26:32 we reconcile that were good with both
26:36 groups we're good with the Flat Earth
26:37 group and we're good with the ball earth
26:39 people and in the next argument we're
26:42 going to make or the next observation
26:43 we're going to make and so we then have
26:49 to decide ok where are we and what is
26:52 this blacc map it's up there it's blue
26:54 during the day oh my god can you imagine
26:57 if it was red
26:58 how bizarre the world would look they
27:02 got it's not pure white but okay so we
27:08 get we get this extra interesting thing
27:10 that happens at night if you think about
27:13 information being input into a computer
27:16 or something well if we told a computer
27:19 and artificial intelligence look up this
27:21 camera is always gonna be on the roof
27:23 and despite all the other cameras you
27:25 might have mounted inside a Boston
27:28 Dynamics robot which you can inhibit and
27:29 run around the world the one up I want
27:32 you to pay attention to now and tell me
27:34 what you think and the artificial
27:36 intelligence you ask it about two
27:38 o'clock in the afternoon what do you see
27:39 I see blue skies and some clouds it
27:43 might rain today looks like you get a
27:45 tan today make sure and wear your
27:47 cancer-causing sunscreen
27:49 now it's nighttime it's winter it's
27:54 winter solstice December 21st
27:57 meaning the shortest day of the year so
28:00 now we ask it about 5:30 we put it a
28:04 nice you know remote community so you
28:06 can get a really good observation of the
28:08 sky we say what do you see you know he
28:11 goes he probably says the 2010 line oh
28:14 my god it's full of stars but it says
28:17 you know I see these white shiny
28:19 crystals in the sky and there's a weird
28:23 mosaic the stretch stretches across the
28:26 center of it what is that I say well
28:31 we'll come back tomorrow we'll talk
28:32 about that but you keep watching it then
28:34 you come back eight hours later and you
28:36 say well what else have you seen well
28:39 they all seem to rotate new ones are
28:41 coming up from the horizon on the west
28:45 and the ones on the east are going away
28:50 actually can't remember what what the
28:53 rotation on that is directionally
28:55 speaking and then it wants to know what
28:59 is that well what are you gonna say with
29:04 an optic that's simply identical to the
29:09 human eye
29:10 without giving the AI a telescope or
29:14 access to an array of telescopes or some
29:17 orbital telescope it's gonna be probably
29:22 just as mystified as us
29:24 something's up there if it's some
29:29 elaborate thing made by a god then
29:34 there's an interesting design quality to
29:36 it because what is space in terms of or
29:40 what words or adjectives could you use
29:42 to describe what we see on an average
29:44 day
29:46 well it's chaotic right they're just
29:50 everywhere their brightness differs hmm
29:56 but then there's this Milky Way thing I
29:59 mean that's what we call it anyway they
30:02 say it's the edge of our galaxy but like
30:06 I've said before what did they say our
30:09 galaxy is they say it's a spinning disk
30:12 just they've shown us all these
30:13 photographs I have never looked through
30:18 an optic and ever seen a galaxy galaxies
30:21 in terms of spiral galaxies they only
30:26 exist in print for me and about you
30:28 they're not webpages of course I've
30:32 never seen one let me know if you've
30:33 ever looked they're not deacon see I've
30:35 been to the Griffith Observatory and
30:36 supposes looked at Jupiter I've been on
30:39 my friend's backyard and looked at
30:41 Saturn I was definitely very real I
30:44 think we turned it to Jupiter 2 that
30:47 night but if you were to really put
30:50 trillions of stars in some disk and then
30:54 we are looking at its bisection right
30:56 we're looking at them all lined up on
30:58 each other we'd say by saeschie but
31:00 looking at it from the horizontal
31:01 compression well it was light not as
31:04 powerful as we think because all the
31:08 stars were supposed to be seeing or
31:10 actually in our galaxy but it would seem
31:12 but according to these cosmologists that
31:15 tell us were in a galaxy it would seem
31:19 that light is probably 99% missing for
31:24 galaxies because wouldn't it be the
31:27 brightest thing you've ever seen haven't
31:30 you seen these pictures of galaxies
31:31 right sure there's some nebulas out
31:33 there maybe blocking some stuff but
31:36 there must be a giant wall between us
31:39 and me and the center of the galaxy if
31:41 the Milky Way is truly what they're
31:43 saying it is but now again if it's God's
31:48 doing God's creation there's a weird
31:53 thing about space because the idea is
31:56 like why would you even make it it's
31:58 like that story and Douglas Adams book
32:01 it's the third or fourth hitchhikers
32:03 guide camera which one I always listen
32:07 to in radio form so I never know what
32:08 book I'm in it's been made hmm
32:13 well you're God and you believe in God
32:16 so when you believe in God you tend to
32:19 attach to things intent purpose if there
32:24 is no God or God is a very omnipotent
32:28 non-interfering creature then things
32:31 could just be it's true but it's there
32:36 and it's undeniable I can't see it
32:38 during the day I mean just a little bit
32:40 of atmosphere reflecting blue we can't
32:42 see it anymore hmm
32:44 I'm sweared so yours truly especially
32:50 with Dave's analysis there is camera and
32:53 these spheres that keep falling all over
32:57 Earth again it looks very machine made
33:01 but then again the OL idea is like what
33:04 if our in some weird you know Terry
33:07 Gilliam movie and it's son Brazil Flat
33:10 Earth movie and so those places
33:12 basically falling apart I reported once
33:15 a couple years ago the fact that nASA
33:20 has admitted that stars are disappearing
33:25 out of our visual spectrum for no reason
33:30 they're just disappeared
33:33 well one could get really creative and
33:36 say okay these are spheres that are
33:38 attached to the inside of a giant dome
33:41 which is one of the first theories of
33:43 what stars were which is why they call
33:45 them falling stars right comets always
33:48 go down they never go up ever they can
33:54 go across and depending on how you're
33:55 oriented looking at them you might think
33:57 they went over your head but the thing
33:59 I've never seen either recorded or in
34:02 real life and I have seen so many
34:06 falling stars shooting stars meteorites
34:11 is what they want you to think but
34:14 they've always come straight down but
34:17 for just a strand of ball in space and
34:19 there's a bunch of debris in space then
34:21 at some point you should be staring at
34:23 the horizon and a meteor goes up towards
34:27 you know towards over your head should
34:30 be the case but that's never the case I
34:32 said I've ever seen well the most
34:34 brilliant shooting stars I've ever seen
34:36 in my life I was working for Jim Hall
34:40 racing when I first came out here and we
34:43 were driving to through Los Angeles
34:44 really late at night but we're up on
34:46 this hill from Ventura County to LA
34:49 County called the grade that's a really
34:53 up high and this super super bright and
34:56 I mean just bizarre diamond rotating
34:59 brightness not a phosphorous glowing
35:02 burning meteor like you know I've seen
35:06 those two in Kansas but look like a
35:09 diamond was falling out of the sky and
35:10 it was super fast just straight down to
35:12 the earth from our vantage point it
35:16 looked like it was gonna impact you know
35:19 South Los Angeles and I remember I was
35:22 like just two guys my roommate myself
35:25 and with Lucas we're like whoa you know
35:27 and having just recently come out of
35:29 Kansas and where you can see all the
35:31 stars at night and I mean I've had I've
35:34 seen [ __ ] stars that are so furry and
35:38 huge it's like a firework going off at
35:40 Disneyland I've hit it you know I think
35:43 I mentioned this once before I was
35:44 having it
35:45 just a minor disagreement with the
35:47 girlfriend my high school sweetheart
35:48 we're just kind of outside just debating
35:52 something I can't remember but then she
35:54 couldn't see cuz she's staring at me but
35:56 I was looking at her and I could look
35:58 over the roof of this house and this big
36:01 giant shooting started Wynonna's I was
36:03 just Gauss MACT man and that immediately
36:07 stopped the argument we went and laid
36:08 down on the trampoline or then we saw
36:12 jet aircraft pull u-turns and nothing
36:16 flat it was the weirdest thing and seen
36:19 what Close Encounters of Third Kind
36:20 right so that you see them enter the
36:22 atmosphere with this phosphorous globe
36:25 and then we're literally watching you
36:28 know one of those triple light
36:30 situations red and green to give you
36:32 orientation with a white light somewhere
36:34 on there and it was just flying a flying
36:36 and then I kid you not it just turned
36:39 like a u-turn and came back the other
36:41 way it must have been no more than the
36:44 width of the craft to the other side as
36:46 I change directions
36:48 you know aircraft doesn't do that
36:50 satellites don't as far as I know
36:55 so really weird eating so let me throw
36:59 this theory at you this is what I'm
37:00 trying to get to there's a lot of us
37:05 that think that maybe the reality is
37:08 nothing more than a global consensus I
37:11 have an episode called consensus reality
37:12 that talks all about it which is that we
37:14 as the species are merely hive minding
37:17 our brains and we're imagining this
37:19 whole place all the senses that we
37:22 suffer but it's a communal thought right
37:27 I give you a super bad analogy but
37:30 imagine you're eating at one of those
37:32 restaurants that has the big lazy susan
37:34 in the middle of Asia and restaurants
37:36 have this right so a lot of food in the
37:38 center and the waiter he's bringing food
37:40 over once everything's on the table now
37:45 we're all taking turns eating the food
37:48 off the plates and we're rotating this
37:50 thing you get to the next dish and we're
37:52 eating and we're watching each other eat
37:54 something off of the plates right so as
37:57 we do this we're all conceding
37:59 that overall you know Jim took a wing a
38:05 chicken and Mike Turk took a turkey leg
38:08 and I took some mashed potatoes
38:10 now someone might be looking down at
38:12 their plate and they're not noticing
38:14 that these subtractions have been made
38:17 however because we're hive mining even
38:19 though they're looking down they're
38:21 getting the update through the network
38:23 that those items are missing it's in the
38:27 back channels of the brain not in the
38:29 frontal lobe so it's not like they're
38:31 seeing it but when they look up and look
38:33 at it it's missing and they may actually
38:35 as a human being be surprised oh my god
38:38 who ate all the mashed potatoes and I
38:40 say not me and I got mashed potatoes off
38:42 in my mouth but their reality machine is
38:45 on a different level in their brain so
38:49 if you had a dual channel system we're
38:52 all conceding that this stuff exists
38:54 perhaps you believe my backyard exists
38:57 because over thousands of years we have
39:01 conceded what shape the earth is
39:04 initially we all want with flat but 500
39:07 years ago the jesuits that's truly a
39:09 true story started funding the changing
39:12 of the shape of the earth maybe one
39:15 community believed a long time ago like
39:17 the Egyptians that it was browned but a
39:20 bunch of other folks kept thinking it
39:22 was flat the Egyptians are more advanced
39:25 they had pie and Pythagoras theorem and
39:27 everything before any of people existed
39:29 and us kind of dopey folks in Europe
39:34 kept thinking it was flat well now
39:37 through publicity through CG through
39:42 special effects and paintings and all
39:43 this other stuff an organization funding
39:49 hundreds of other organizations plus our
39:52 textbooks plus fiction on TV are
39:55 essentially changing our global
39:57 consensus what's the Mandela effect the
40:02 Mandela effect could simply be the
40:05 competition for which group of people
40:09 believe something the most
40:12 well the berenstain bears are believed
40:16 by Europe because it's a British name
40:18 it's used and as I understand it and
40:22 there's twice as many people in Europe
40:23 as there are in the United States the
40:25 United States had Berenstein well when
40:29 the internet happened
40:30 the consensus machine again it's the
40:33 conscious layer sinks into the
40:35 subconscious layer of consensus and then
40:39 all of a sudden we have all these
40:40 discrepancies if someone asked me who
40:44 Eli Whitney was I kind of answered now
40:48 like well when I was young it was a
40:49 black guy now it's a white guy an
40:53 inventor of the cotton gin weird but
40:57 some folks were raised with what is now
40:59 but even in the United States they were
41:02 raised with what is now the consensus
41:07 none of my close friends ever thought he
41:11 was a white guy every one of my lounge
41:14 thought he was black all my closest
41:17 friends and relatives thought he was
41:18 black and all of a sudden his way
41:22 interesting well if you're white
41:25 supremists trying to change history with
41:29 not being interesting a little
41:30 modification in history now will just
41:32 erase every single article every word
41:36 that the guy was ever black and just
41:38 make him white because that means their
41:41 race didn't ring so why would the earth
41:45 be here in any shape at all and then
41:49 there's this stuff up there that's black
41:51 with these little stars if it's a
41:53 consensus reality was it that someone
41:58 started some story a long time ago you
42:02 know the Native Americans have just one
42:04 of the most beautiful belief systems
42:07 with the Stars
42:08 they say the stars are made up of all
42:12 the souls that essentially ascended to
42:15 heaven they don't really believe in a
42:18 heaven they believe in stars well we
42:21 know the Egyptians through the gada Newt
42:23 believe that the stars were painted on
42:25 inside of her body that she her feet are
42:30 on one side and her whole bosom goes all
42:32 the way over to her hands she's just
42:34 painted with stars it's interesting so
42:38 did the stars come first or did man come
42:41 first
42:41 of course any normal scientists would
42:44 say stars obviously came first let me
42:48 throw you a wild card here but I think
42:51 is very interesting with this type of
42:53 argument what if everything exists right
42:57 now and the only problem that we are
43:00 running into not really a problem but
43:03 the only issue we're running into is
43:08 that it takes us a long time to see it
43:12 and as we see it it starts to exist for
43:17 all of us and before we can see it it's
43:21 whatever it is now again there's so many
43:26 interesting things about the Flat Earth
43:28 proof book but that is sort of
43:32 undeniable this notion that we're moving
43:35 really really fast but the equator is
43:37 moving at a thousand miles an hour but
43:40 someone really close to the North or
43:42 South Pole is barely moving at all and
43:44 somehow you can fly a plane from London
43:47 to Cairo and there's no correction for
43:51 the fact that you are caning I don't
43:53 know seven hundred miles an hour in
43:55 horizontal movement as you're making a
43:57 vertical dive straight down latitude
44:00 wise hmm it seems like you'd have to
44:05 haul ass to catch up with it and I'll
44:08 throw you some some support here my flat
44:11 earthers anytime someone and you guys
44:15 have probably already heard this but on
44:17 the idea of latitude acceleration you
44:23 know when someone says oh creating a
44:26 time machine is very difficult because
44:29 if you were to say I'm gonna go back to
44:32 1865 and watch a speech or something I
44:37 can't really when the Gettysburg Address
44:38 was made
44:39 the two-minute speech but physicists
44:44 well even cosmologists will tell you
44:46 okay well then the earth was in a
44:47 completely different place in the
44:49 universe so or / galaxies if that's even
44:53 true and so you're not only gonna have
44:56 to figure out a way to travel back in
44:57 time but you're gonna have to move in an
45:00 XYZ coordinate to go back to where earth
45:02 was at that point so you can step on the
45:05 surface again because if you just
45:07 transport right now you'll be out in the
45:11 middle of space right okay so they're
45:15 willing to acknowledge a correction in a
45:18 time machine such that you can be where
45:20 the earth is but when a plane takes off
45:23 from London and flies to Cairo and I'd
45:28 say like it and I don't know exactly
45:30 what it would be rotational e350
45:33 something like that in London maybe 400
45:35 tops but when you're in Cairo you're
45:37 moving a thousand miles an hour roughly
45:41 900 something really high
45:43 how are you accounting for the fact that
45:46 you've just gained all this lateral
45:48 movement so I understand helicopters
45:53 just taking off and hovering all right
45:57 just so you built a helicopter that
45:59 could fly for 12 hours it has enough
46:03 fuel just to sit there for 12 hours and
46:05 it just hovers off the ground like 50
46:07 feet and it's locked into some cool
46:11 computer control thing so you just sit
46:15 there and just say choo choo choo choo
46:17 choo choo choo for 12 hours he'll at 50
46:20 feet you could probably run the fuel
46:21 straight up to the vehicle now we've
46:25 seen that if we're on around earth no
46:26 matter how much you want to say the
46:28 atmosphere influences your speed
46:31 laterally you're going to be separating
46:34 from the earth which is moving
46:36 supposedly rotating at a particular
46:39 speed why isn't this thing eventually
46:43 see the earth kind of move away from it
46:45 and just say yeah I see kids that's why
46:48 we know we're on a ball boom so the inch
46:52 thing of saying that you know like in
46:56 because we know that ether exists
46:58 because we've proved it it calls out to
47:03 space having for all intents and
47:08 purposes a infinite amount of mass out
47:11 there call ether particles
47:13 it's what's holding this whole thing
47:15 together so if you're a flat earther you
47:18 have to explain ether existing the fact
47:22 that we do have Fibonacci patterns that
47:24 seem to exist at the micro level and the
47:27 macro level meaning the same book of
47:29 physics is controlling the whole thing
47:30 aka matrix programming controls the
47:33 whole thing but the interesting thing is
47:37 why do the stars exist if there was no
47:42 space it's a dome let's say it's another
47:47 sphere around the sphere let's say why
47:52 make an inquisitive bait for the human
47:57 consciousness you're baiting man to look
48:01 up unlike that other culture you're
48:05 baiting us to want to go there because
48:08 why well we're pattern creatures and
48:11 when we get tired of a pattern we want
48:13 to change the pattern why do people move
48:15 from city to city all the time and some
48:17 people stay in their hometown for their
48:19 whole life while some people more
48:21 susceptible to pattern fatigue and
48:23 others find comfort those that find
48:26 comfort stay in their hometown those
48:29 that want to move around move around I
48:31 will say that there is a just having
48:35 known some wealthy people or no know
48:37 some wealthy people right now there's a
48:39 sadness I have for folks that constantly
48:41 tell me how they have to travel the
48:44 world now I respect the fact they want
48:47 to see the world but there seems to be
48:49 some of my friends have a disease almost
48:52 of the mind where they can't they will
48:54 never be in any one place forever until
48:59 their bodies just expire and then you're
49:02 what are you and I mean then you're in a
49:04 basically a prison
49:06 because not only does your body not
49:08 allow you to travel well now what are
49:10 you in a hospice and some assisted
49:12 living and now you're just so stuck in
49:14 one place that's why as part of a mental
49:19 discipline I eat the same meal every day
49:21 because life doesn't change every day if
49:24 you want to fall in love with someone
49:25 they don't change every day so at some
49:28 point you have to develop the skill set
49:30 to love the same thing every day
49:33 so us answering the question of the
49:36 motive to create space to create well
49:39 sorry excuse me
49:40 the starmap very specifically with this
49:44 milky way because there's two sides of
49:46 the game plus there's planets out there
49:49 Jesus it's like could you possibly bait
49:53 man anymore I mean we've talked about
49:56 the Moon and Mars a hundred times on
49:58 this show
50:00 alright well once you saw the moon once
50:03 man saw the moon man wants to find out
50:05 what the hell that thing is we want to
50:07 go up there we want to step on it we
50:10 want to see if we can live there we want
50:11 to see if there's fun stuff up there has
50:13 anyone ever been there before I mean I
50:15 looked at a bunch of moon photos the
50:17 other day and you know there are
50:19 definitely big protruding rocks up there
50:21 that look dinah structural right they do
50:24 I believe there's a moon base on there
50:26 well I haven't seen any proof John layer
50:29 can pointed his pictures and just sort
50:33 of god I think it'd be funny to you'd be
50:38 take a picture of some stucco or
50:39 something really close blow it out wide
50:41 give it to John layer and you'll find
50:42 Space Station's on it but the Milky Way
50:45 is like a monkey wrench and the whole
50:47 thing it's like Jesus what is that you
50:52 know I gave an analogy that I can't
50:54 shake out of my head now it's been there
50:55 in my head since I came up with it but
50:59 part of my brain was I said this in an
51:01 episode that I thought what if we're
51:03 simply looking out looking at the edge
51:06 of a egg shell what must it look like if
51:10 you were to be a sentient chicken inside
51:12 of an egg but you're really small in the
51:14 center of the egg in you're looking out
51:17 and they say the egg is not white let's
51:19 say it's very opaque but it has some
51:21 porous thinner areas and those by having
51:26 light on the outside of the shell shine
51:28 through we're rotating in the center so
51:32 it's rotating around us interesting
51:35 what's the Milky Way well it's some
51:37 weird scene that is very weak in the
51:41 shell very interesting right one of the
51:47 things again I've said this several
51:50 times but while we're on the subject and
51:53 people have been generally very fairly
51:56 nice about their statements of you know
51:59 space doesn't exist and that's their
52:00 whole comment not looking at the fact
52:01 there's two or three other guys said the
52:03 same thing in the same comment stream
52:04 but the fact that you know if you want
52:10 to talk about like the evil Jesuits or
52:12 the evil group of people right pick your
52:14 race pick your prejudice or whatever the
52:17 interesting thing is is they can get us
52:19 to actually dislike other human beings
52:21 simply because we're debating a reality
52:25 well we're all trying to figure out
52:27 where we are I'm assuming that the Flat
52:30 Earth folks definitely think that the
52:33 globe airs are shallow gullible but you
52:43 have to understand that they think the
52:44 same with the flat earthers I don't know
52:48 how long it's going to be before we have
52:50 a an independent technology platform if
52:55 it is affordable such that you know Joe
52:58 Schmo millionaire can just hop in his
53:00 hovercraft and go straight up go 80
53:03 miles up and start taking pictures and
53:06 look down and say oh my god it's disc
53:10 with upturn edges it's a sphere the
53:15 other curiosity if we just pick it apart
53:17 just a little bit more is why if it was
53:20 fake okay let's say it's orbs they're
53:24 emitting some sort of plasma just like
53:28 it's like a light bulb right
53:30 then why would so many well why do all
53:33 the stars have a different luminosity
53:36 right why do they have different lumen
53:38 ratings why is that the case why
53:44 wouldn't it be uniform if it was uniform
53:48 does that spell out intent is this an
53:51 ingenious method of instilling on the
53:54 minds of man or any other sentient
53:56 creature that lives down here see look
54:00 up you see those random little jewels up
54:04 there in the sky because we have given
54:08 them varying brightness you are to
54:12 assume that this is a random thing and
54:15 that this is not intentional that your
54:17 container is not intentional
54:20 it is truly organic just like you but
54:25 let me throw you another scenario real
54:26 quick I don't know if you've ever
54:28 thought about this but what if instead
54:34 of stars there was nothing for the
54:40 entire history of our stay on this
54:43 planet as a species there's nothing up
54:46 there yeah we get a blue sky because
54:50 we've got a Sun but we look at the moon
54:55 it's like NASA shots right never any
54:58 stars they built a space station without
55:02 a window pointing in space mm-hmm
55:06 because it's so real up there right but
55:09 what would that do to our psyche okay
55:12 how do we even begin to parse that
55:14 question well let's just say we roll
55:19 back history to whenever man showed up
55:23 was dropped off or whatever created
55:26 right when we got the I think therefore
55:29 I am sort of level of sentient
55:31 consciousness and we just erased the
55:33 Stars so new in Egypt she would be most
55:40 likely an African woman who's just black
55:42 and she
55:44 is the darkness that's above us maybe
55:50 she wouldn't exist don't know Native
55:54 Americans would then lack their entire
55:57 history their entire philosophy of where
56:00 soul goes because there would be no
56:02 stars to claim ancestry probably
56:08 wouldn't be much in the way of science
56:11 fiction except land-based science
56:13 fiction so be more like Blade Runner not
56:16 like Star Wars maybe someone would get
56:20 super clever somehow claim in a science
56:23 fiction sense or a sci-fi sense they
56:26 could duplicate the Sun and take it
56:29 somewhere in the universe somewhere in
56:31 the blackness of space but who the hell
56:34 wants to do that what's interesting
56:37 about the notion of floating in space
56:39 forever is that even if you can
56:43 contemplate such a thing you get hurled
56:44 out into space you're in some I don't
56:48 know stasis pod or you're able to live
56:51 forever for whatever reason and there's
56:53 stars out there you know that the law of
56:56 averages would be two things you would
56:58 end up going into a Sun which is
57:00 probably the most likely thing because
57:02 the gravity on the Sun is way more than
57:04 a planet but there's a slim chance in
57:07 hell that you could lend up end up on a
57:10 asteroid a moon or a planet hopefully
57:13 with a surface and you could get out and
57:17 maybe move around or at least you could
57:19 see something you've never seen before
57:21 right but if you were out there in a
57:25 container and it's black and for so many
57:31 years you could look back at the Sun and
57:34 see this little speck of light but you
57:36 know eventually you're not gonna see
57:38 anything and then it's just a void for
57:41 the rest of your existence well that's
57:44 kind of terrifying being alive but being
57:49 utterly pointless in your existence you
57:53 would start creating a reality inside
57:54 your mind probably try to dream all day
57:59 does space give me in a context and is
58:03 that something that was intentionally
58:05 put there because let's face it if we're
58:11 not completely random in terms of our
58:14 existence in the universe and we have a
58:16 God or we are God the one we're just one
58:23 being we just happen to live it the same
58:26 time under different vessels but
58:28 whatever it's intentionally creed well
58:32 we did this we put all that stuff out
58:34 there
58:35 and so funny as I blow the smoke clouds
58:38 up you guys can't see it but it's
58:42 swirling just as a natural behavior is
58:48 there anything on earth it's like stars
58:51 is there any fabric of rock or moss that
58:56 glows that's a bit like the Stars I
59:01 don't know I don't think there really is
59:04 maybe when you get up at night to pee
59:07 and you close your eyes and you can
59:09 still see little you know impressions of
59:11 your cones and rods I swear to God when
59:13 I get up in the morning and I keep my
59:17 eyes closed I'm standing up I swear I
59:20 can see my rods and cones as they are
59:23 laid out in the back of my eyeball I see
59:26 the pattern I see what is it the the
59:30 rods are small and the cones are big I
59:32 think it's the truth about that my other
59:36 question for sort of flat earthers is if
59:40 you believe this is the firmament dome
59:42 and they just have well sparklies all
59:44 over the interior of this thing with no
59:47 explanation for the thing that we call
59:50 the Milky Way it would be why would that
59:55 exist in a firmament dome like why
59:58 that's a lot of work if they're truly
60:00 these plasma balls like Dave seems to be
60:03 recording that's energy that's someone
60:07 working really hard on these things if
60:09 the sphere is falling from space are
60:11 space debris then what are they I mean
60:18 if they really are these things seems to
60:20 be almost man-made and crudely made the
60:22 weird thing about those spheres that
60:24 keep falling from the sky and that was a
60:26 Vietnam we had like six of them a couple
60:28 years ago you know they like blown
60:31 fiberglass spheres some of them the
60:35 click there made a really heavy metal it
60:38 seems a little strange that they would
60:39 be made fiberglass makes sense because
60:41 it's a lightweight material but some of
60:43 these like metal ones
60:45 seems like you wouldn't make him out of
60:47 that necessarily and they're they're
60:49 really small so it seems odd it also
60:54 seems odd that the Space Agency's so you
60:58 know we know I'm gonna say this and
61:00 you're gonna roll your eyes because you
61:01 can imagine it but that's a very
61:03 dangerous regiment to have you know you
61:06 should launch a rocket or you learn some
61:08 into space and it's like well what are
61:09 we gonna do with all this
61:10 oh we just have we just dropped another
61:12 one jump by the window well you know
61:16 imagine okay so the landing in Vietnam
61:19 we haven't had one land in Paris New
61:21 York LA Bangladesh Shanghai but can you
61:26 imagine someone's just filming a
61:29 relative and Disneyland and here comes
61:31 one of these orbs and if God knows how
61:36 fast they move who knows no one's ever
61:38 seen one land they don't seem to this is
61:42 the other thing that's strange they
61:44 don't seem to be self-destructing when
61:46 they hit the ground they do seem to be
61:48 burned quite a bit but they also don't
61:51 seem to be embedding themselves into the
61:53 soil like they would if they were moving
61:54 the average speed of a rocket when it
61:57 hits orbit technically speaking these
62:00 things would hit some massive terminal
62:04 velocity but if they hit a human being
62:06 or human beings or a house or a car
62:10 we're talking about a massive impact
62:14 let's say can hit a 130 miles an hour
62:19 you're gonna have human pate everywhere
62:23 so far so good
62:24 hasn't had
62:25 and seems like it would be a possibility
62:29 if these things are you know falling off
62:32 some firmament dome then what's that say
62:33 about the don't once I say about the
62:36 dome engineers certainly seems mortal to
62:38 me doesn't seem like a God made product
62:39 to me but you hear this thing all the
62:42 time the old belief of the dome was that
62:46 it was actually a bubble of water yeah
62:50 we're in a bubble of air and it's a
62:52 water above okay so where are these star
62:58 things are they in the water
62:59 I mean Dave's footage would not exist in
63:03 my opinion if water was between us and
63:07 it and then the question is like okay so
63:11 it's a dome
63:12 all right great what's on the outside of
63:14 the thing and then the other question is
63:17 why would they rotate because regardless
63:20 if you believe it's a dome or not they
63:23 rotate in the sky bulb photography
63:26 proves it
63:28 why why does it need to rotate makes no
63:32 sense heliocentric makes sense why those
63:37 things are moving in a circle now
63:39 there's all these theories about how you
63:41 can use an optic to create the South
63:43 Pole stars versus the North Pole stars I
63:45 mean some really elaborate amazing
63:48 optics that people have conceived which
63:51 work it's crazy but why you know do you
63:58 do anything that you don't have to in
63:59 life I mean do you just walk out and you
64:03 know clean your car right after you
64:05 cleaned it do you build a wing on the
64:07 side of your house when you don't only
64:08 want one no you put 2 pairs of paints um
64:12 just because you came No
64:14 you tend not to do anything that you
64:16 don't need to do because it creates a
64:19 our energy exertion but the more since
64:22 heat you are as a being you've got other
64:25 things you'd rather be doing if nothing
64:28 else sitting around doing nothing
64:29 because it's fun to watch NASCAR yeah I
64:33 am more and more
64:37 convinced everyday although fractionally
64:40 so that the intelligence threshold might
64:43 be just what's going on here I think
64:47 that because I can conceive of it as a
64:49 human being that I wouldn't want to get
64:54 so educated excuse me it's so educated
64:57 that I couldn't enjoy magic right like I
65:03 you know it's funny you can technically
65:06 go online and find out how every magic
65:09 trick
65:09 could be done now great magicians find
65:13 slightly different ways of doing it but
65:15 you wouldn't really want to do that
65:17 would you
65:18 because if you did that you wouldn't be
65:20 able to enjoy anything you know I you
65:24 know it's really strange there's a few
65:27 people in my family to have this too I
65:30 don't even know what you call it someone
65:32 told me one day about this ability and I
65:36 was like whoa that's a real thing
65:37 because I think I've got it which is
65:39 music when I hear a song that I really
65:43 like if I hear something I don't like I
65:46 tend to ignore it and don't put it into
65:48 long-term memory but for some reason
65:50 especially classical music most
65:52 specifically Bach Mozart and Beethoven
65:57 but even Rachmaninoff if I heard any of
66:02 their beautiful works of music I so
66:07 ingest did that stuff as a kid that I
66:11 have all the movements memorized and I
66:15 you know what it'll be the thing is like
66:18 I have to have someone started typically
66:19 I can't remember exactly how everything
66:22 starts but once it gets rolling it's
66:24 like I go into this sort of it's kind of
66:30 two prong it's kind of bliss and it's
66:31 kind of angst one because my mind is a
66:39 my memory is you know it's strange when
66:44 I look at maps I can memorize them and
66:46 then just drive straight to those places
66:49 but yct like I've said it several times
66:51 I see everything in a time line but I
66:54 see it all at the same time and so I
66:57 have to kind of focus my brain and move
66:59 it along the time line as I speak and
67:02 when I listen to classical music
67:05 I am so aware of the next note of the
67:09 next instrument that's gonna play of
67:11 what you know Mozart was trying to do a
67:14 particular time or Bach or whatever that
67:16 I want to sing it I want to sing the
67:19 note so I want to just it how we all do
67:21 those things at the same time my mind is
67:25 angsting because I want it to be done
67:27 like I want to hear that next movement
67:29 and it's not here yet and so I'm like
67:32 I'm trapped in a linear time problem and
67:37 it's because I have knowledge of it that
67:40 I suffer from this weird thing and I
67:44 think that there you know there's a
67:46 flavor of that with knowing everything
67:49 about how everything works
67:51 they got those mysteries thank god
67:53 there's frontiers think about Freud you
67:57 know coming up with his theory about the
68:00 different regions of the mind
68:03 I'm sure while he was coming up with it
68:05 it was utterly fascinating I'm sure he
68:08 wanted to go to work every single day
68:11 but after he came up with his theories
68:13 whether he's right or wrong I'm sure he
68:15 got kind of bored because what was what
68:18 was the new thing that was going to
68:20 occur by the way the Oedipus complex I
68:24 was talking about this with a friend I'm
68:25 going to digress on you guys hardcore
68:27 from space for one second
68:29 Oedipus complex is that you want to make
68:31 love to your mother kill your father and
68:35 there's all kinds of examples of this in
68:38 history one we probably at some point
68:42 were a pack animal you know we were
68:48 harems just like I mean I'm not saying
68:51 we were monkeys or anything like that
68:52 but the cats do it lions do it and how
68:55 does it work in within a particular
68:59 species before there was an idea of
69:02 incest
69:03 before you know we had morals and you
69:06 know we had a basis in a code for
69:08 reality we hung out our father was
69:12 probably the big guy right and he killed
69:15 off anyone else that was messing with
69:17 him which is how he earned his keep then
69:19 he gets to sleep of every female in the
69:22 entire pack but as a son of your father
69:25 you're gonna have to if you want to get
69:28 laid you're gonna have to knock the old
69:29 man alphas rocker you have your brothers
69:32 to mess with my hair incestual brothers
69:34 and then as soon as you become the alpha
69:37 male which there's only really one
69:40 predominant alpha male in any pack
69:42 creature then you get to sleep with
69:44 technically your sisters and your mother
69:47 maybe but if that truly exists it's
69:51 merely the modern form of that recessed
69:54 instinct gene in us because that's the
69:56 way you might have lived for a really
69:57 really long time
69:59 I'm just gonna say thank God those days
70:01 are over
70:02 on the subject of intelligence threshold
70:06 as it relates to understanding what
70:08 space is and where we are in this place
70:12 that we are you know I will say that
70:19 similar to the the angst I might feel
70:22 mathematician might feel when you try to
70:24 say you know conceive of every number go
70:27 and your buddy goes you feel like your
70:30 chest implodes it's an infinite concept
70:33 trying to fit inside of a finite
70:34 container you can't do it no human I
70:39 would say outside of a divine being
70:43 that's not human could ever possibly
70:47 conceive that you know it would be
70:49 interesting to see of God himself could
70:51 conceive of all the numbers that could
70:53 possibly exist all at the same time
70:54 because it's an infinite growing
70:58 paradigm it infinitely goes up and
71:01 infinitely goes down so it's sort of a
71:04 paradox of consciousness when I push
71:10 into these thought processes of what is
71:12 space what are those stars
71:15 what is
71:16 the Milky Way does this crap really
71:17 exist have all those galaxy shots been
71:20 you know
71:21 airbrushed or you know computer
71:25 simulated or whatever to be interesting
71:29 to know in the very first picture of a
71:31 galaxy ever showed up although actually
71:33 make an effort to look that up and put
71:35 it on the screen but the angst I feel a
71:39 little bit inside is sort of like a push
71:41 back don't think about that it's sort of
71:45 how I feel like another outside force is
71:49 sort of pushing on my chest don't think
71:53 about that I'm gonna take your breath
71:54 away if you think about that oh god you
71:56 know I am a just figure out what my
71:58 backyards all about you know so I'd be
72:03 interested in your opinion of whether or
72:05 not you have any angst really going
72:09 after these potential paradigms of
72:12 infinity because let's face it space
72:18 will eventually achieve an infinite
72:21 paradigm in your brain if it's
72:24 heliocentric ball then you're definitely
72:26 in this realm of like okay how BIG's the
72:28 container how many stars are out there I
72:30 mean they'll tell you but give me a
72:32 break
72:32 we have no clue if we can't see the
72:36 center of our galaxy is a big bright Sun
72:38 a bunch of like you know millions
72:40 billions of stars all closely compact
72:43 together and that's not some gigantic
72:45 star in the sky lighting it us up during
72:47 the day and the night I mean there
72:49 should be any night there shouldn't be
72:51 any night if we're right next to our our
72:53 own galaxy center we were not
72:55 technically as they say next to the
72:59 center but I mean what's happening to
73:01 all the light if you believe it ether
73:04 then there's an explanation
73:06 the verbal wave of light is it's not a
73:09 particle it's a reaction of concussion
73:11 you would eventually die down because
73:15 it's getting slammed by counter ether
73:18 going the other way and eventually just
73:20 like a sound wave that dies off you
73:22 can't hear someone yelling at you two
73:24 miles away on an average day you can't
73:28 see the Sun at the center of the galaxy
73:30 or the the sunlight from all the
73:33 millions and billions of stars
73:35 theoretically at the center of our
73:36 galaxy right but here's the paradox
73:40 right we can't seem to see this giant
73:44 cluster of stars at the center of our
73:46 galaxy however NASA and all these
73:50 observatories have no problem seeing
73:53 other galaxies in the universe well
73:56 how's that possible right how is that
73:59 possible
73:59 either light travels that far or it
74:02 doesn't travel that far and if it does
74:04 travel that far then our own galaxy
74:05 should be again a blinding ribbon in the
74:08 sky blinding like star tape you know I
74:15 hope of nothing else this episode
74:18 reminds you of how much we're not really
74:21 taught to think because I have consumed
74:26 I don't know probably not technically a
74:29 hundred books on the subject but
74:31 probably easily fifty nice to get two
74:35 books a month for three years consuming
74:38 all of it not all of it was cosmology
74:41 related but I mean all the magazines
74:42 I've ever read all the college classes
74:44 I've ever taken on the subject you know
74:48 I took college astronomy
74:50 I got 103 in college as my final score
74:54 never took a note but the dudes we even
74:57 had the guy from NASA come for a whole
74:59 week and he was like unbelievable man
75:01 the guy was like had us on the edge of
75:03 our seats but none of this stuff's ever
75:07 explained another paradoxes are ever
75:09 explained because a lot of times you
75:12 know you'll learn something and a good
75:14 teacher will say now you might wonder
75:16 why it's like this well let me tell you
75:18 boom boo-boom boo-boom and all of a
75:19 sudden your your question it's deep
75:22 inside your mind is answered even if you
75:24 weren't able to fully construct it to
75:26 the teacher and raise your hand so you
75:29 know we've only had two listeners at a
75:32 513 shows I finally looked it up today
75:36 this is probably at least three there
75:38 unpublished but because they're just
75:40 like me messing around with the previous
75:42 episodes but of all the other ones we've
75:46 only had two folks report in that they
75:47 have ever dreamed of being on the
75:49 enterprise I acid mead the question you
75:53 know if you'd ever dreamed of space and
75:54 he had had a very kind of acid trippy
76:00 dream when I asked him to describe it to
76:03 me which what's interesting about Sid
76:05 describing something to you is it's it's
76:09 not some average well it was sort of
76:10 kinda like this but he was talking about
76:12 being kind of hurled through the
76:13 universe very very quickly and now I
76:18 would simply say that was just you
76:20 visiting your home like at your own
76:21 planet but think one of the kids said uh
76:24 he dreamed about being on the enterprise
76:26 and he said well I was on a bunch of
76:29 cough syrup and other medication for a
76:32 really bad cold so he was good enough to
76:36 let us know that that was part of the
76:38 part of the experiment that he was under
76:41 so let me know what you think I mean you
76:43 know I really really really do want
76:47 Glover's to not be pissed off at flat
76:51 earthers and flat earthers not to be
76:53 pissed off the globus just understand
76:56 that the way the information came to
76:58 each group of individuals you ended up
77:02 where you ended up I say this every time
77:05 I bring up the subject but you know
77:08 being a hylia century person not out of
77:11 any peer pressure but because of
77:12 expanding earth I can't say that I have
77:16 seen any proof other than expanding
77:20 earth that is like the biggest piece of
77:21 proof that all the continents fit
77:22 together on all sides just erase the
77:25 oceans and with very little reshaping of
77:29 anything I mean just minut scooting no
77:33 subduction I mean you know plates go
77:35 underneath other plates to make it work
77:39 I'm sure there's plates I'm sure they go
77:42 sliding around a little bit but
77:43 continents don't the continents don't
77:47 slide on
77:48 ball-bearing you know layer on but you
77:51 know beneath the oceans are new soil
77:55 it's new plates that are coming out of
77:58 the interior of the earth we've proven
78:01 it absolutely proving it by by labeling
78:05 the plate down the seam of the Pacific
78:07 and then watching it over 25 years pop
78:10 out and there's a new plate coming up
78:12 but if you're a proponent that has
78:15 commented several times in other
78:16 people's videos space doesn't exist
78:19 that's all you write you know try to go
78:21 deeper try to go deeper into that ok
78:24 you're saying it doesn't exist so I'm
78:26 asking you what are those stars you
78:29 can't tell me they're behind water it
78:31 doesn't work that way because Steve's
78:33 photo photography go to our Facebook and
78:35 join that group and look up Dave's posts
78:37 and you'll see just with a little camera
78:41 I think he's utterly proven that between
78:47 us and those stars there's no water
78:49 that's for sure our atmosphere doesn't
78:52 seem to be affecting it either much so
78:57 again try to dig deeper in your brain
78:59 you could have the answer you could have
79:02 an epiphany having the thought for the
79:05 very first time trying to answer an
79:06 enigma that we're all waiting for and
79:09 then you crack it but if you never try
79:12 if you hang on to your own cliches that
79:15 you type in responses you know type in
79:17 comments then you're not growing and
79:19 you're not being deep you're just having
79:21 a thought and you're regurgitating into
79:22 the text I'm assuming that anyone that
79:25 says space doesn't exist and they offer
79:27 nothing else about the subject they
79:30 could talk about other things in their
79:31 comment but they don't offer any more
79:32 explanation they've never thought about
79:36 it really anyway I think that's all I
79:40 got on that one if you have them into
79:42 deep thoughts radio.com please go if
79:44 anything just bookmark it forget it case
79:46 the show gets moved around YouTube gets
79:48 really draconian you'll always have a
79:51 [ __ ] shoot and we'll find some other
79:52 place if that has a problem again
79:55 what's I've said there's a couple times
79:58 I'm gonna say it again
79:59 for all these rumors that you know
80:01 YouTube is canceling channels because of
80:04 this content or that content I was
80:06 watching something the other day and
80:07 they were saying that um oh it was a a
80:12 guy said that his video on JFK being
80:15 alive was shut down shut off well I got
80:19 the same episode so mine still strange
80:24 very very strange maybe I could check it
80:26 but I just referred someone to it and it
80:29 was still fully functional with it gets
80:30 even monetized anyway we have two video
80:34 YouTube bits you get a bit shoot account

80:39 have all the podcast you could ever want
