00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen so uh yeah it's just one of
00:36 those days it's time to record an
00:37 episode here I haven't done like a head
00:41 on self-improvement episode in a while
00:43 and yet the amount of people that I run
00:46 into daily who needed wanted just
00:52 looking for someone to feedback loop
00:55 with them do a reflection session
00:57 someone who couldn't inspire them look
01:00 inside their soul and go I can see this
01:02 talent at least I can see the ambition
01:04 and the willingness to get the talent
01:07 there's not a lot of people out there
01:09 like that because a lot of people are
01:11 struggling and especially with this time
01:16 we have a bunch of you know Millennials
01:20 with education but the challenges is
01:24 that the skill sets are either too
01:28 plentiful so the jobs are not available
01:30 because they're all taken and we need
01:33 more creativity but there's no
01:35 mentorship you know school doesn't teach
01:37 you creativity unfortunately and it can
01:40 be taught it actually can't be taught
01:42 and it's really kind of getting into
01:44 exercises that move you from your left
01:47 brain exclusive execution of what you
01:49 proceeded to be as talent over to the
01:51 right brain so that you can start
01:54 becoming an artist with your life now
01:58 this isn't going to be exclusively
01:59 anything related to something artistic
02:04 and this is going to be the big idea our
02:07 thinking big excuse-me episode and
02:09 there's all kinds of preparations to
02:12 make sure that just having the concept
02:14 that you're going to think big that's
02:16 the first step but going and getting it
02:20 and making sure that you can you know
02:22 acquire the talent that you need the
02:25 drive that you need to get through all
02:27 of these different layers that you're
02:31 going to have to go through and stick
02:34 with it it's a big deal and it's not
02:37 trivial
02:38 if you've never done it before it
02:40 becomes trivial fairly quickly once
02:43 you've done it before it doesn't become
02:44 necessarily easy well let's say that you
02:47 learned how to play the guitar from
02:48 scratch okay
02:50 you went through hell and back to get
02:52 there all kinds if I bet pick out figure
02:55 out what style you're gonna do you can
02:56 do acoustic and electric you can do
02:58 metal your new country and then you
03:00 you're gonna blues you got to learn all
03:02 the different licks you'll learn that
03:03 learning a bunch of licks from one style
03:05 of music is going to feed another style
03:07 of music and then you want to go okay
03:09 now I want to learn how to play the
03:11 piano because I want to start with some
03:14 piano type music and sitting you gotta
03:16 start kind of all over but not quite now
03:19 you understand music theory now you know
03:22 generally I need to operate this new
03:24 thing with so many notes in an octave so
03:28 many octaves on a particular controller
03:31 full-blown grand piano and so now you're
03:35 accompanying your guitar technology that
03:37 you've learned but let's say that you
03:40 can only do repetition of someone else's
03:42 lesson and I knew that riff from that
03:44 song remember I could play stairway to
03:47 heaven or whatever it is but you want to
03:49 write your own stairway to heaven your
03:50 own song your own
03:53 symphony whatever then you need to have
03:57 your creative mind what are you trying
03:59 to do here let's say on one level you're
04:03 like well I don't even care what it is I
04:06 just want to feel like I'm being more
04:09 creative it could be painting it could
04:12 be writing movies it could be anything
04:17 maybe just need to do a big giant risk
04:21 in your life because you got one more
04:23 chance you're young enough to do it or
04:25 everything that you've tried isn't
04:27 working and you understand the
04:28 definition of insanity which is to
04:30 continually doing the same thing and
04:32 expecting a change part of it is where
04:35 do you start and the beautiful thing is
04:39 that that particular answer is actually
04:41 extremely basic what life do you want
04:47 you know do you wanna
04:50 yet you're by yourself most the time you
04:52 want a partner you want a wife you want
04:54 a husband you live in a particular size
04:56 house you want a bigger house you want
05:01 this or that but you design your goal I
05:04 know some of this sounds trivial we're
05:07 gonna get past the trivial and get into
05:09 the nuts and bolts as quickly as
05:10 possible hopefully before it rains now
05:14 the other thing to remember about
05:15 goal-setting in terms of what you think
05:17 you want depending on how many years
05:19 days months it takes to get your goal
05:21 who you are by the time you actually get
05:24 to your goal might actually change
05:25 drastically when we're young we're very
05:28 impressionable too tangible objects we
05:30 want fancy cars because we and we're
05:33 following some musician it's got one the
05:35 actors got one maybe you're just into
05:36 cars you want a gigantic house until you
05:39 realize property taxes and upkeep and
05:43 all that stuff and as you get older
05:45 you're like you know what I just really
05:46 need what I need I don't need all that
05:48 big stuff so you might end up changing
05:50 your mind if it takes a little while to
05:52 get it just understand that about your
05:55 goal and be excited if in a particular
05:57 day you reduce the complexity of your
06:00 goal by reducing your overall need
06:04 bucket right you're like what if you
06:08 wanted to Lamborghini boy after I drove
06:11 on and off and on for about six months I
06:13 wanted one so bad and I thought it would
06:16 be and I knew it was silly there you
06:18 know ridiculously expensive I would have
06:20 to be making you know ten times the
06:22 amount of money I make now in order to
06:24 just blow it off right and that's that's
06:27 the kind of money I would have to make
06:30 to buy something like that because I
06:32 have all kinds of other things that
06:33 would invest in first but you know if it
06:35 was pocket change okay you know whatever
06:39 it's an amazing vehicle but time went on
06:43 life continued and I basically kind of
06:47 renegotiated that in my mind yeah you
06:49 know if a miracle happens and great I'll
06:51 go out and get one but if it doesn't you
06:53 know I don't need to have a $12,000 a
06:57 year license plate bill actually I think
07:01 about what it's about 1/10 that but it's
07:02 you know in California be about
07:04 twenty-five hundred three thousand
07:05 dollars just to put a plate on it once a
07:07 year
07:08 nuts right so guess what happened what I
07:15 have to do to get my goal in life is
07:18 reduced
07:19 you know intangible objects are never
07:22 anything that's on my list anymore
07:24 you know it's all about people and
07:26 communication and what I create I want
07:29 to blow people's minds that's my goal in
07:31 life and I've had a very lucky
07:33 successful hard-working life that has
07:36 allowed me to do a lot of that alright
07:38 great but you know how do we usually
07:42 make goals in this world I mean what do
07:44 we do physically when we think about got
07:46 a goal I got a dream right you typically
07:49 just sit down somewhere and you dream it
07:52 out you're on a beach you're inside your
07:54 car maybe there's someplace you hate and
07:56 so you dream about the good place maybe
07:57 you're in someplace great that inspires
07:59 you to put down your goal on you know in
08:02 your brain but it's extremely important
08:05 and I know it sounds old-school and
08:07 analog but you really need to have your
08:09 goal print it out written down probably
08:12 better if you write it down because that
08:14 adds a little bit of a personal curve to
08:15 the whole thing but put it somewhere
08:18 where you're gonna see it every single
08:19 day maybe in the mirror in your bathroom
08:21 because we always look in the mirror in
08:23 the bathroom
08:23 we don't always go in our office we
08:25 don't always go in the kitchen you could
08:28 keep it in your car but then it's sort
08:29 of exposing your goal to the outside
08:31 world and what gets in your car can
08:32 start busting your chops on it and it's
08:35 a private affair
08:36 it's it's you write write it down well
08:41 case the changes you can change it you
08:42 can go up and revise it you can add more
08:44 or subtract be specific you know so many
08:49 times in life I've said to people well
08:52 tell me what you would love to have
08:52 happen and they give me a very
08:54 matter-of-fact answer when I'm doing
08:56 like you know a career management on
08:57 somebody our life management or whatever
09:00 and I said okay now that's that answer
09:02 sucks and look at me really funny and I
09:05 said well if you don't tell me let's say
09:08 I'm God I got the magic wand I can give
09:10 anything that you want you give me some
09:11 stupid little sentence
09:16 then that's all you're gonna get the
09:19 verbs and nouns and adjectives that you
09:21 use are extremely important when you're
09:24 writing down your goal how do you want
09:27 this to happen any specifics that are
09:29 missing will be missing from your final
09:31 product
09:33 imagine someone asking you you know who
09:35 would you like to marry okay boy girl
09:38 didn't matter and if you don't write it
09:41 down they don't have it if you don't
09:45 write down that physique is important to
09:47 you while they wait for hundred pounds
09:48 if you don't say that their height is
09:50 important to you or you'd like to have
09:52 them shorter than if you like them
09:54 shorter little the woman or the man will
09:56 be six feet eight you know and if you
09:59 like I'm a petite then they'll be huge
10:00 you know whatever write it down
10:03 get your goal defined now once you have
10:08 it written down at least in some form
10:10 and again maybe it's a very dynamic
10:13 thing you know maybe you keep it in two
10:16 computers if it's really super
10:17 complicated that way you don't have to
10:19 write it all by hand but I tell you what
10:21 if you did have to write it out all by
10:24 hand you would know it more and more and
10:26 more every single time you would forget
10:28 a line that you wrote because it's like
10:29 writing that I will not throw spitballs
10:33 at the teachers head sort of thing you
10:36 can write that a hundred times sort of
10:37 thing right but once you have it then
10:41 you can start examining what that really
10:44 means is there four or five things that
10:46 are gonna make up your goal or one thing
10:49 there is no writer than there's no wrong
10:51 you determine you determine everything
10:54 in that set that will make you happy no
10:58 you should if you are spending your life
11:00 with someone else you know you might
11:02 want to check it out if you got some
11:03 weird ones on the list honey do you mind
11:04 living on a boat the rest of your life
11:06 you know something like that but the the
11:10 infamous now Bill Cosby I mentioned this
11:13 two or three times in season one there
11:17 was an episode of The Cosby Show where
11:18 he went in to teach his son's class his
11:21 older sons class and they played it up
11:25 like his son was really you know you
11:28 know a shame
11:29 that his father was teaching in class
11:31 but bill just sat back on a chair and
11:34 what he said was he goes you know what
11:37 do you want to be in life and a bunch of
11:38 kids in the room didn't have any real
11:40 definite answers couple kids did but he
11:44 says okay if you want that thing in life
11:47 then what you need to do is figure out
11:48 how many steps it takes to get it and
11:51 then you start taking those steps and of
11:55 course you will find out eventually that
11:57 some of your steps are completed with
11:59 other steps and some of the steps
12:01 actually expand into more steps okay
12:04 nice thing is if you just picked up the
12:07 football one into the field and the goal
12:10 that you have to make is on the other
12:12 hand if you can just move a one
12:13 millimeter a day well eventually it will
12:15 cross the touchdown zone
12:17 some days you're gonna get a first down
12:19 some days maybe you get sacked and you
12:23 lose a few yards that's okay it's all
12:26 part of the process do you get better
12:28 when you do things twice oh yeah
12:31 that's what's cool and it's a lot easier
12:32 usually the second time but this episode
12:35 is about thinking big so we're not just
12:38 talking about goal-setting we're talking
12:41 about taking your current frame of mind
12:44 which is littered with paradigm limits
12:47 past history limits you believe you have
12:50 limitations because you've never been
12:52 able to cross a certain threshold of
12:55 something and we want to potentially
12:59 maybe not in every area of your life but
13:02 in these areas related to your goal we
13:04 want to push it up and the most basic
13:06 one is outside of being able to have a
13:09 talent that you don't have developed a
13:10 lot of it ends with I never made that
13:13 much money in my life and if those of
13:16 you for those of you who've read Rich
13:18 Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki he has a
13:22 beautiful example that his Rich Dad
13:24 which is his friend's father who owned a
13:26 bunch of pineapple plantations in Hawaii
13:30 when he caught the two kids melting down
13:33 nickels and making things with that I
13:36 can't remember what they were doing he
13:39 says are you guys can't destroy money
13:41 that's illegal so I'm gonna
13:42 you work in the little convenience store
13:44 I own off one of the highways on Oahu I
13:46 think alright all the kids did was
13:50 straighten straighten the aisle
13:52 straighten all you know pull the things
13:53 up make it all flush day in and day out
13:56 day in and day out and eventually Robert
13:58 hit his limit he was like I don't wanna
14:01 do this anymore and so when he's picked
14:04 up he refused to go back and the Rich
14:07 Dad said great you've learned your very
14:10 first lesson
14:11 what's that lesson he goes you want more
14:14 out of life don't you it was like yeah
14:16 this little kid it was like eight or
14:18 nine ten years old something like that
14:20 and so he goes okay well tomorrow we're
14:22 gonna start on this next journey where
14:24 we're gonna start to look at what you
14:25 really want to do and on the way home I
14:28 thinking up think I have this right he
14:31 says well I got a beef with you and one
14:34 way or another as a child he said this
14:35 guy's okay what's the beef he says that
14:39 lady she's an old woman and she's a
14:42 clerk at that place I can tell you don't
14:45 pay her very much
14:46 her clothing doesn't look nice you know
14:48 like she should have because he really
14:50 liked her and her car is a piece of crap
14:52 this job isn't you know really what a
14:55 child would even perceive as an adult
14:56 doing now if you live in Hawaii it's
14:59 probably just fine
15:00 but he took the opportunity to teach
15:02 Robert a lesson and he goes she makes
15:05 the amount of money that she believes
15:07 that she should make and that's her
15:10 issue not my issue ah first thing about
15:16 thinking big would be to say you believe
15:20 that you should be able to do more now
15:24 we have a little problem with society
15:26 today had that line been said to me in
15:28 1985 as a child I would have perceived
15:31 extremely hard work going through all
15:34 those steps that Bill Cosby talked about
15:36 and doing what we call paying your dues
15:40 but you say it in 2019 and you have a
15:44 millennial who's been taught socialism
15:47 as a parachute to life and they're like
15:50 well yeah you know what I should be a
15:51 director of Hollywood movies says my
15:53 first job I should be a millionaire
15:55 Morrow because there's this entitlement
15:58 thing going on I don't know how many
16:01 people watched this show that would
16:04 actually have that sort of opinion I
16:05 tend not to think that but if you are
16:07 running into folks like that or you know
16:08 you just have that little bit of a twang
16:11 in you the idea is well there are steps
16:14 you can take to jump ahead for sure and
16:17 I'm gonna give you one of my personal
16:19 experiences so you can see how it's done
16:22 one way to do it right but when I got
16:25 into screenwriting and film development
16:28 in general you get your ass kicked so
16:30 fast by people that are so much more
16:33 talented than you are you realize is
16:36 that the only way that you're gonna get
16:37 to masterful writing if you haven't been
16:41 writing a since absolute childhood and
16:43 you've got this epiphany mind they
16:45 always seems to drag just diamonds out
16:47 of the sky which you'll still have you
16:50 have a part of that in you anyway which
16:51 is why you're gravitating towards that
16:53 but you do have to pay your dues you
16:56 have to write film after film after film
16:58 your own stuff because that reveals a
17:02 whole lot more than say remaking someone
17:04 else's stuff okay it's not insane to do
17:08 either one but just realize if you want
17:10 to be at the tippy tippy top of Michael
17:11 Crichton world where you're writing a
17:13 Wes world sphere Jurassic Park you're
17:17 gonna have to pay your dues and learn
17:18 how to do it and learn how to do it well
17:20 because you can have a great premise but
17:22 you can't write story for crap and your
17:24 stuff will never get made so it's a huge
17:27 process and it's multi-layered which
17:28 we're not gonna get into in this one but
17:30 I was in the San Francisco Silicon
17:34 Valley area I should say Silicon Valley
17:36 I really didn't spend much time in the
17:37 city proper and I managed to amass a
17:41 tremendous amount of like success doing
17:44 database engineering as one of my
17:48 talents I knew had a program every
17:52 single database that was a modern
17:54 database out there plus the product I
17:56 worked in was super advanced and it
17:58 could talk to any back in blah blah blah
18:00 so by the age of say 23
18:06 is 1992-93 that's probably make it
18:10 $80,000 a year I'm a young kid pulling
18:16 down big cash now right now in Orange
18:18 County and neighboring counties you
18:22 would have to have a PhD and work for
18:24 ten years as a teacher to get $80,000
18:28 that's 30 plus years later right
18:31 I guess 25 plus years later so by my
18:34 mid-20s I was averaging about 85 k a
18:39 here without my psych consulting which
18:42 was in the video game business at a
18:43 burro my own product was selling at the
18:45 fortune 1000 companies so I had some
18:47 other additional income as well but I
18:49 knew that my eight-hour day job had to
18:52 make somewhere in the 80s here's the
18:55 problem here comes the internet I'm
18:57 actually writing Internet expansion
18:59 packages for the product that I'm in but
19:01 my core talent is in this database
19:04 industry and they keep telling us the
19:05 whole world is gonna go to the Internet
19:06 and we don't have the languages yet to
19:08 even do it you know that's why I'm
19:11 Amazon so amazing because they they were
19:14 living inside Perl they were living
19:17 inside C it was a rough planet back in
19:20 those days on the Internet
19:22 but I'm also an artist I'm making tons
19:25 of money on the side drawing things from
19:27 company logos to all kinds of stuff and
19:30 so I'm like well I got a trans transfer
19:33 my skillset into the Internet but I'm
19:37 here I'm over here really blessed to
19:39 have spent five years mastering this
19:41 database engineering stuff and I don't
19:44 want to slip a beat I don't want to
19:45 especially come home and not be able to
19:46 pay my bills
19:48 okay so every day I worked eight hours I
19:52 was a very senior employee at the
19:54 company I was managing to other people
19:56 designing products I mean I would do the
19:59 interface designer all that stuff I'll
20:01 write the documentation write the
20:03 tutorials program the product go present
20:06 it in front of like 600 people plus I
20:08 was running my own software on the side
20:09 and selling man so I'd work at least
20:12 eight hours at the company come home and
20:17 I spend no less than four hours a night
20:20 at least five days a week puzzles making
20:23 tons of music on the side so that's
20:25 where my weekends went but I must have
20:28 done this for two years from 1996 to
20:31 1998 roughly learning had a program Perl
20:36 learning how to draw in Photoshop before
20:39 any filters helped you with anything I'm
20:41 gonna mention this once before but dr.
20:43 ozone was a guy out there that just was
20:45 a god in Photoshop man now most of what
20:48 he has is a click away so when I first
20:51 switched jobs into this internet room I
20:54 had to take a hit of like down to 80
20:57 grand from 85 to 88 II but I had this
21:00 residual cash from other things I was
21:02 fine but I did it I identified the steps
21:06 that I needed to take identified what
21:08 was currently at the time called web
21:10 mastering which means you were an artist
21:13 you knew interface design and you were a
21:15 proficient programmer they could do
21:16 anything plus I had mastered how to
21:19 program chat rooms and so I immediately
21:22 joined a company that specialized in
21:24 that service for the entire Internet
21:26 cool so I need you if you want to think
21:31 big to understand entitlement get you
21:34 absolutely nowhere if I just sat on my
21:37 house to go well I'm gonna start
21:39 programming the web at the company which
21:42 means I'm a junior coder
21:43 I barely know Photoshop and I want them
21:46 to pay me this massive salary really
21:49 okay none of you would most likely think
21:52 that of course but because you don't
21:55 think that we have to identify the steps
21:57 that are going to get you there now the
22:00 other thing that is a big deal is the
22:04 amount of hard work you're gonna have to
22:06 put in to get there but of course if
22:08 it's your goal hopefully that hard work
22:11 translates into something we call love
22:14 and love makes work feel like play no
22:18 matter how difficult it gets
22:20 you're still loving it you know and I'm
22:23 trying to work on a script and I can't
22:24 crack it I'm still I'm frustrated but
22:28 I'm still smiling I'm still loving it
22:30 now some people say okay
22:34 um I get you I understand I know what I
22:38 want and I'm actually very familiar with
22:41 the steps I need to take however I don't
22:45 have the time to do it so I'm just going
22:48 to concede to what I have and live life
22:51 well I would say as long as you're not
22:53 living in pain and suffering you could
22:56 do that but today we know that age
22:59 discrimination starts about 50 about my
23:01 age if you don't have really exceptional
23:03 skills in something but they want you to
23:05 delay your Social Security intake until
23:08 you're 75 what a joke
23:11 what a joke that our government plays on
23:15 us for retirement think about it go get
23:19 a job at 65 and tell me what that that
23:21 experience is like you'll get a job at
23:24 70 go get a job at 73 the people who are
23:28 those ages today are still struggling
23:32 and they got the American Dream you know
23:34 they were living in the 80s in their 30s
23:37 and 40s when jobs were everywhere and
23:40 you were expected to get some sort of
23:42 retirement plans some sort of pension
23:44 pensions almost a word that's
23:46 disappearing like the name you know
23:48 Nikola Tesla so no matter how you know
23:53 content you might be with your life
23:55 right now Society in America is pushing
23:58 you to reinvent yourself you must almost
24:01 I mean you know you know whether or not
24:03 you have a job that's one of those jobs
24:04 maybe your Union person may be your
24:07 teacher teachers have it bad up front
24:10 but then they have it great in the end
24:12 because they can work for quite a while
24:14 right teachers can be pretty damn old
24:17 and appreciated and depending on what
24:19 Sciences and you know teaching that
24:22 they're in and that's a great thing but
24:26 we're in a world it's different
24:29 there are programs launching all over
24:31 the planet that are trying to get people
24:33 to understand this there are you know
24:36 for as much as you might see some you
24:39 know ridiculous climate change thing
24:41 that's completely fake go look up my
24:43 episode on global warming I'll give you
24:46 all the science on it
24:47 so you can stop worrying about it but
24:50 the one thing that's really really
24:52 important is this sort of life learning
24:54 thing you're going to have to be
24:57 learning constantly and the interesting
25:01 thing is is that it used to be that you
25:03 could you know what was the advice in
25:04 the 70s your grandparent or your parent
25:07 might tell you just learn how to do
25:09 something learn how to do it better than
25:12 anyone else and then you'll be just fine
25:14 in this world and they're still
25:16 thankfully a lot of careers that can
25:18 still do that I know a few but a lot of
25:23 the careers are going away like that
25:25 they simply don't exist where you can
25:28 learn how to do something well and dah
25:29 dah dah dah dah mmm not so much it just
25:34 appears a little bit more into that DNA
25:36 imagine you work on assembly line
25:38 building a car I don't care if it's a
25:41 Tesla or a Corvette or whatever
25:43 well it takes physical prowess to be
25:46 able to do these jobs stand up all day
25:48 bend over a little bit every day hook a
25:50 wire here do this there because we are
25:53 demanding for retirement purposes which
25:56 again your Social Security doesn't pay
25:58 any of your bills really
25:59 but because we're demanding that people
26:01 work until they're 75 well the body
26:03 gives out before you're 75 if you're in
26:05 a physical labor thing which is why a
26:07 lot of people gravitate to unions that
26:09 provide pensions in addition to Social
26:11 Security but you can tell why unions
26:14 appeal to people but a lot of folks have
26:18 those same requirements but they don't
26:21 have anything to protect them and so
26:23 they're sitting there waiting to break
26:26 as a human being and so depending on
26:30 your health depending on you know your
26:33 environment what you do for a living you
26:36 may need to beat a haste to some other
26:40 career where you can get your butt in a
26:41 chair you know and thankfully management
26:44 is a really great natural sector to go
26:48 into if your company respects management
26:51 that has seen your knowledge a lot of
26:54 companies nowadays they look at your
26:55 salary requirement and they're like okay
26:57 we can hire this dude right here or
27:00 continue this guy's
27:01 employment or girls employment in their
27:03 60s and 70s but you know what they drive
27:06 a Mercedes now they have grandkids
27:08 they've you know they've got whatever a
27:12 bunch of financial requirements and
27:14 their salaries are now already over a
27:15 hundred grand to two hundred grand all
27:19 right
27:19 or we could hire a 30 year old person
27:22 migrate someone up inside the company
27:25 that's already done a little bit of the
27:26 work shows good mental aptitude we could
27:29 spend 20 30 40 50 thousand dollars in
27:32 training for that person get them up to
27:35 the level we need them and maybe even
27:37 beyond some of the wisdom of these older
27:40 folks and replace those older people
27:44 we've also talked about you know the age
27:47 of robots coming in so physical labor is
27:50 gonna be most likely replaced by robots
27:52 but you know robots still have touch
27:55 points with human beings in them so you
27:57 may be able to learn a new skill but
28:00 look at the Amazon warehouses oh my god
28:02 there's almost no human beings these
28:04 robots go around pick stuff up bring it
28:06 to the front then they can push it into
28:07 a box label it get it out the door it's
28:10 tremendous scary for some folks the
28:15 reason why the arts are so powerful for
28:17 human beings in this world no matter
28:19 what you do meaning something creative
28:21 is that a artificial intelligence is not
28:25 going to be released in your lifetime
28:27 that we'll be able to do anything super
28:29 creative really really well unless
28:31 you're probably in your teens or 20s and
28:33 you live a long life if you live to be
28:35 80 to 100 years old you'll probably see
28:37 it but now you know and there's some
28:40 episodes that are very similar to this
28:42 one I think it's important to go and put
28:43 out new ones that repeat some of the
28:45 information one because I'll have a
28:46 different more focused take but - no
28:48 one's going back to look at the old ones
28:50 and it's good to throw like a little
28:52 memory bubble out to the front year so
28:55 for the hardcore listeners there's a lot
28:56 of repetition at least in theme in this
28:59 particular episode versus old old
29:01 episodes but now time management is a
29:05 concept that is usually not recognized
29:09 in the brain as a personal requirement
29:12 or personal
29:14 skill set it's usually time management
29:16 is all based on you go to a corporation
29:18 and then you have time management inside
29:20 a corporation trying to make sure people
29:22 work you know the most hours possible to
29:25 get something done that that doesn't
29:26 done where there's a whole wing of it
29:29 that's for you and your personal life
29:31 and because of cell phone technology and
29:35 and tablets it's easier to make the
29:39 example today than it was say 15 years
29:42 ago but how many of you without a
29:45 committed or not you go to the restroom
29:47 and now the restroom is actually kind of
29:50 fun you either grab your iPad or your
29:52 cell phone you take it in there and you
29:54 catch up on your news your emails the
29:56 all your social media whatever and it
29:58 makes the experience just go away you
30:00 know it's like it's not boring anymore
30:02 nice tinder staring at the wall you're
30:04 doing something well before all that
30:07 existed yours truly would slow TMI but I
30:12 would always use the bathroom experience
30:14 as as a time to do things especially to
30:19 learn I would read books I read
30:21 magazines that were educational I
30:23 reached to write songs when I got my
30:25 first keyboard it was fairly portable I
30:27 drew my yearbook cover the artwork in
30:30 there I mean it just it was a place
30:32 where a lot of great things happened it
30:35 was the only real downtime I had where I
30:37 was still conscious right because when
30:39 you go to sleep well you're off in la-la
30:40 land right but as I got into story
30:43 writing the cool thing was is no matter
30:45 where I was unless I was with other
30:47 people but if I was by myself on my car
30:50 by myself really anywhere I could always
30:53 incubate up something a value now
30:56 there's some places that you'll tell
30:57 yourself that you're gonna do things of
30:59 value you're stuck in an airport for
31:01 three hours so I got a you know three
31:03 hour layaway well I'll just get out my
31:04 laptop and do something some of you are
31:06 really good at that
31:07 a lot of us will dream a dream of doing
31:10 that and you know it's just not the
31:12 environment you're into people watching
31:14 or you're exhausted or whatever can't
31:16 find a power supply which is actually
31:18 getting a lot easier these days but
31:20 every single split second of your life
31:21 when you're trying to think big is huge
31:24 there's the again I mention this guy you
31:27 know if
31:27 episodes back but the the millionaire
31:30 man who's now calling himself the
31:31 billionaire man believe he's an American
31:35 that now lives in Scotland he made a
31:37 really good point during one of his
31:39 classes which you can see online I will
31:42 put his link down below and if I ever
31:45 say I'm gonna put a link down below and
31:46 you look down below and it's not there
31:49 leave a comment that I missed it I'll
31:53 put it in the comments and then I'll
31:54 delete your comment so that you don't
31:57 have something dangling out there that
31:58 makes you look dumb reggae like you
31:59 didn't put it in there and then I put it
32:00 in there and you look like you're lying
32:02 let's just create that little ritual but
32:05 this dude said look it goes in different
32:08 you know the difference between say you
32:10 one of his students and Bill Gates and
32:13 Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos he said that
32:19 these men were willing to work out of
32:22 their office for the first 10 years of
32:24 their life
32:25 huge sacrifice and when he says that he
32:29 means that their loop was so freakin
32:31 tight you're talking about getting up
32:33 doing a bathroom which will maybe
32:35 kissing your kids and your wife goodbye
32:37 going to work crunching a good 10-hour
32:40 day if you're getting out early 12 and
32:43 14 if it's a normal day come home try to
32:47 squeeze something out of your
32:49 relationship go back to bed and repeat
32:52 for 10 years now let's provided you have
32:57 a good idea in the first place right and
33:01 but that's a billionaires regiment I
33:04 doubt too many of you listening to me
33:07 need to be a billionaire so that
33:08 crunches your soul and you're like oh my
33:11 god you know you're right I'm definitely
33:12 not gonna go for anything big because I
33:13 don't want to be working him maybe or 45
33:16 55 65 and you're like definitely time
33:19 for that don't worry about that whatever
33:22 you're gonna put into it again think
33:25 about what I just told you about my
33:26 career I put four hours in a day after
33:28 work and I launched a whole new career
33:31 at the almost the same pan take a five
33:33 take five K hit you know I got some
33:36 stock said the deal - I I can definitely
33:40 vouch for
33:41 my own laziness losing probably no less
33:47 than half a dozen I know three off the
33:51 top of my head which I can't even
33:53 mention because they're still viable
33:54 ideas to this day but at least half a
33:57 dozen successes that if I had really
34:02 really really quarantined myself
34:04 got rid of all my pastimes I probably
34:08 would have succeeded with at least one
34:11 of them in a multi-million dollar
34:13 situation and it's really tough to look
34:16 back and go god man I should have done
34:18 that more you know I was heavy into
34:20 music in the 90s and really pioneering
34:23 some new sounds and then I let life get
34:26 a hold of me and I just went off on
34:29 something else you know and I did
34:32 something else very successful but still
34:34 I mean like I could have done both at
34:36 the same time oh my god
34:38 you know regrets a [ __ ] regret is that
34:40 feeling that you will always have the
34:43 rest of your life if you don't Rima Taba
34:45 lies it in Reaper spective you know
34:47 analyze it that's a bunch of weird words
34:50 together to remove your regret you live
34:53 with it for the rest of your life maybe
34:55 you just said something bad to someone
34:56 oh god you can never take that moment
34:59 back unless you can find them and
35:00 apologize but you still did it you know
35:03 so I do have a episodes all about time
35:08 management season one just go to the
35:10 website deep thoughts video com search
35:12 on management and you'll find it it's
35:15 back in season one it's actually you
35:18 know really pretty good I mean that was
35:20 my whole goal in season one was getting
35:21 all the basic side in life it's easy
35:25 making the first hundred episodes let me
35:27 tell you if you have kids you know wife
35:30 you got a husband whatever the situation
35:32 is you use every spare time of your life
35:35 but again you focus on the goal you
35:38 focus on where you want to be but now
35:41 what's the secret to getting anything in
35:43 life the first secret is conceiving of
35:46 it first
35:46 I want that oh yeah you know what as a
35:49 little kid every little kid wants a
35:51 Lamborghini my cousin had a poster of a
35:53 Countach on his wall
35:55 everybody wanted one okay but you know
35:58 you don't really want it in a sense that
36:01 you know anything about how to get it
36:02 you're a kid if you want one in your 40s
36:05 now you're starting to look at okay
36:07 what's the down payment again what's the
36:09 monthly on this what's the registration
36:11 cost what's the upkeep what's a break
36:13 change cost you're really looking at
36:14 what it takes to get it done and then
36:17 you look at your bills and you look at
36:18 taxes and you know you're oh my god I
36:19 gotta make a ton more money that I'm
36:21 making now well let's just take that for
36:23 an example the Huracan is like between
36:26 220 and 250 thousand dollars right now
36:30 it's faster than Aventador so just get
36:33 yourself Huracan okay let's say that
36:38 that's your goal and you're gonna give
36:40 yourself two years to get it now it's
36:42 twenty thousand down twenty five hundred
36:43 a month in Orange County and that's not
36:47 any of your registration bills again
36:48 it's about twenty five hundred to put
36:50 the license plate on it it's gonna go
36:52 down a little bit over the years then
36:54 maintenance Lana I don't have any clue
36:56 what the maintenance is right but let's
36:59 say after two years you're not there yet
37:02 now you can either cash in on your goal
37:04 or you can keep going and just say well
37:07 I thought it was gonna take me two years
37:08 maybe was gonna take me five years keep
37:11 going you keep going maybe you're just
37:12 saving up the whole thing and you're
37:14 gonna go it's mine but what if you go
37:17 you know what I really started looking
37:20 at the burden of owning this car as much
37:23 as I'd love it
37:23 it really just was I was starstruck I
37:26 was infatuated with it and now I've
37:29 grown up a little bit what I really
37:31 wants just a nice car and so you go out
37:34 and get yourself a $60,000 car maybe by
37:37 that time you can pay cash for it or
37:39 maybe by that time you pay cash for it
37:41 and you have 40 more left or you realize
37:44 these cars lose so much value you're
37:46 just going to lease it and you got all
37:48 the money left and you run off and do
37:50 something completely different with your
37:51 life but you know that you wouldn't have
37:54 gotten any options in your life had you
37:56 not stopped and thought bigger thinking
38:00 bigger is a lot of fun have you ever put
38:03 your head down at night and you know
38:06 your little your little wound up still
38:08 you're not really
38:08 drifting off into sleep yet and so you
38:11 sit there and fantasize about things
38:13 what if I did that what if I did this
38:14 you know if I was Superman whatever and
38:18 you started you know feel it for a
38:19 second you start to feel maybe having
38:21 the object it used to be when I used to
38:24 buy lottery tickets I sit in the gas
38:28 station every once in a while or at home
38:29 and I'd look at it look at the ticket
38:32 you know it hasn't been read off yet by
38:34 the lot of people and I think about oh
38:37 my god what if all these numbers all
38:39 seven numbers you want is a 650 million
38:42 to one comes through on my ticket it
38:44 happens right how would your life change
38:47 all of a sudden now for the rest of your
38:50 life even if you took the payments
38:52 instead of the lump sum or the lump sum
38:55 instead of the payments excuse me which
38:56 reduces it considerably and even after
38:59 taxes you would never worry about money
39:03 for the rest of your life all your kids
39:04 get to go to Harvard or Caltech or
39:06 wherever the hell you want to send them
39:07 now you're never gonna have to work
39:09 anymore so you can go after all of your
39:10 dreams you can do anything in this world
39:15 that's where you find out you really
39:16 don't need a hell of a lot of money to
39:17 make it happen
39:18 I mean you make 10 million you get to
39:21 keep five it's $100,000 a year minimum
39:25 for any one of you no matter where you
39:26 are in the world to survive some of you
39:29 live in a much cheaper area that's great
39:32 I'm envious of people that grew up in a
39:35 particular town you'll love it you're
39:37 gonna live there the rest of your life
39:38 and it's cheap it's easy I've seen a lot
39:42 of my friends and family who are very
39:45 skilled they make tremendous amounts of
39:47 money but they choose to live in their
39:49 hometown or little tiny towns they pick
39:51 up everything out of California and they
39:54 move somewhere that's really really
39:57 inexpensive but they're contracting back
39:59 to California or somewhere else big and
40:01 so they're able to make $150,000 a year
40:04 and live in an area that only requires
40:06 you to make 60 and they're just throwing
40:09 cash in the bank
40:10 by the time retirement comes around they
40:11 got half a million dollars in the bank
40:13 and they're like yeah Social Security's
40:15 gonna kick in 275 I'll go the whole
40:17 distance don't care stopped working at
40:19 60 kaboom
40:21 that's all
40:22 thinking big I'm gonna give you a a
40:25 metaphorical and literal example of
40:28 thinking big that I went into when I
40:33 started an art work as a kid my big
40:35 claim to fame again was I could paint
40:37 like a college kid before my teens like
40:41 9 10 11 sort of thing but I painted
40:44 paintings you know that were on walls of
40:46 bars and all this other stuff I'd
40:48 painted you know fairly large canvases
40:50 before and then I found out I could
40:52 paint with smoke bombs very specifically
40:55 black cat smoke bombs okay well I just
41:00 have little drawings on the ground
41:01 people liked it and when I came back for
41:03 fourth of July could you do another one
41:04 in front of my house oh yeah sure
41:06 but eventually I got this idea to think
41:08 literally bigger and these graffiti
41:11 artists that do side of buildings man
41:12 Wow
41:14 I mean that's that's thinking big and
41:16 what you do as an artist is that you're
41:18 you know that you can mess up you can
41:22 draw something out of proportion you can
41:24 get your colors wrong you can make a
41:26 mistake everything's kind of right but
41:29 it's still a mistake so the first big
41:32 mural I did was on this really nice
41:34 street in my hometown which was all
41:35 cement and a lot of streets in my home
41:38 town are either asphalt or bricks so you
41:41 can't do this there's a big slab of
41:42 cement and I did this it's 4th of July
41:45 so I did this gigantic like dollar bill
41:48 I put the Statute of Liberty where the
41:51 president was I put Mount Rushmore off
41:53 to one side I did the what is that the
41:57 the soldiers pushing the flag in the
41:59 ground which I think was in Korea or was
42:02 that Vietnam I can't remember but I just
42:05 decorated this thing like crazy took all
42:07 day to paint with these bumps and my
42:09 fingers are burned you know we got holes
42:12 in my skin and I actually had to spend
42:14 three hours at home with a massive
42:17 headache because I had SuperDuper a heat
42:20 exposure the liquid in my head was
42:23 SuperDuper hot I did take the right
42:26 precautions but I learned something but
42:28 I'm drawing this thing and it's freaky
42:30 when you're drawing it your heart's
42:32 palpitating because you're thinking geez
42:33 you know smoke
42:35 are unforgiving you don't get to like
42:36 wash it off in fact it can rain on that
42:40 thing for months and months and months
42:41 and still be there a year later it's
42:44 changed colors it's kind of interesting
42:46 so that was my first foray next year I
42:50 come back and I thinking okay now I'm
42:52 gonna do another big one but it's gonna
42:53 be a lot cleaner and more interesting so
42:56 I did Statue of Liberty's head with
42:58 their spikes the big American flag
43:00 behind it and I did it on a racquetball
43:02 court thing got in the newspaper moved
43:05 to do huge though this thing was 15 feet
43:08 wide 9 feet tall and the whole town was
43:11 gonna be able to see it when they drove
43:13 by cuz its props straight-up cool rain
43:17 supposedly the town was looking for
43:19 someone to charge for the damage to the
43:21 paint in the racquetball thing it was
43:23 like nobody plays racquetball no one
43:24 even tries to use that thing but they've
43:26 been there for decades and no one's ever
43:28 used him so I used it
43:30 people are Hawking and you know they
43:32 were so happy to see it that the next
43:34 year I came back and I did a bigger ball
43:36 I did one the same size but I just did
43:39 this big eagle and all this other wild
43:41 stuff okay
43:42 and I let people paint with me so had
43:44 some funny little additions to it but
43:47 everyone had a blast right but that was
43:49 me taking a risk not everything came up
43:53 perfect because I hadn't figured out the
43:56 science of getting really close to a
43:58 wall and then because there was no way
44:00 to really sketch it on there I mean I
44:02 did I did use like a construction pencil
44:04 when I was really flat long ones and I
44:06 you know I lay it in but my skills
44:08 aren't up to like mega scale but I had
44:13 to take the risk first I'd fly in a few
44:16 days early I'd sketch sketch sketch
44:18 instead of like sketching back in
44:20 California that was the dumb thing on my
44:21 part so just know that if you have this
44:25 idea and it's given you butterflies it's
44:28 it's usually giving you butterflies
44:30 because you know you're gonna get the
44:31 opportunity to try it what if someone
44:32 wants to do like an audition on some
44:34 American Idol kind of thing you're going
44:36 to go up and become a comedian or try it
44:38 on an open mic night somewhere in your
44:40 hometown you got your peers looking at
44:42 you
44:43 you've been practicing it at home but
44:45 nothing really works until you do it in
44:46 front of an audience even if you use
44:48 your friends and family maybe
44:49 they're laughing because they see more
44:51 in you than the audience is gonna see on
44:52 a dry run take some guts right but
44:57 nothing wrists nothing gained and
45:00 there's a big saying that is so true the
45:04 greater the risk the greater the reward
45:06 and that is it sounds like a little
45:10 saying that's like oh thanks thanks for
45:12 that big piece of wisdom but I'll tell
45:15 you what it's absolutely true and it's
45:17 almost true like a cause and effect that
45:20 the universe guarantees you how many
45:24 times you've ever looked at like David
45:28 Bowie dressed like a woman dressed like
45:31 Iggy Stardust and our Ziggy started
45:34 excuse me
45:34 and all these like kiss going out there
45:36 with makeup on all of these crazy
45:39 amazing and I mean crazy in a great way
45:42 folks that just blew their whole image
45:45 out and went onstage and then there that
45:47 person who does that one of the biggest
45:51 examples is Andy Kaufman if you ever see
45:55 the humor of Andy Kaufman the comedian
45:58 an actor his stand-up routine to this
46:03 day blows people's minds his very first
46:06 Mighty Mouse stuff that turns into the
46:08 Elvis impression he did a lot of crazy
46:11 stuff at the end of his life but still
46:12 he just could think bigger and bigger
46:14 and bigger at the total expense of if he
46:18 failed it could be the end of his career
46:20 on any one performance but this guy kept
46:24 saying you know what I'm gonna blow this
46:26 thing he's a very shy guy but when he
46:28 got on stage he lost all of a sinus and
46:30 then he could do these amazing
46:31 performances dare to think big dare to
46:35 try it do it and the universe is I think
46:39 it's almost if I were to write like I'm
46:42 out Being John Malkovich kind of movie
46:44 but instead of having people inside of
46:45 his brain like Woody Allen did a couple
46:47 times
46:47 it's the ambassadors of the universe
46:50 looking down on us right and you know
46:53 they're looking around trying to find
46:54 someone someone interesting right and
46:57 there's David Bowie putting a dress on
47:00 and you know I think he was
47:03 at least bisexual in his lifetime but
47:04 they may have had a little extra help
47:06 with his natural orientation being kind
47:09 of anywhere anywhere it landed but they
47:12 look at that guy and they're like look
47:14 at this dude oh wow oh wow look at he's
47:16 painting his face he's doing his hair
47:18 red now he's this other space guy well
47:20 he's he's this different dude with the
47:21 Chinatown album right data that are
47:24 trying to grow them excuse me and this
47:27 guy keeps getting rewarded and rewarded
47:29 because they're willing to do stuff that
47:30 no one else is going to do it almost
47:31 entertains the universe universes like
47:34 you know it's like those old those old
47:37 movies like Clash of the Titans the old
47:41 one back in the 80s and it's Zeus
47:43 looking down on the Colosseum and we're
47:45 all the little ponds down below right
47:47 like [ __ ] said we're only pawns in life
47:49 and they bless you kiss my lord I mean
47:54 they're dressed up gene Simmons is doing
47:56 a demon thing the other guys are just
47:58 being cool Ace Frehley is a space guy
48:00 Peter Criss is a cat guy Paul just has a
48:03 star on his eye
48:04 kaboom the music is like everything they
48:08 made that succeed is like an anthem of
48:11 this country for that particular era
48:13 right now I'm gonna draw right now let's
48:18 say your deep thoughts listener and
48:20 you're still here we know that we talk
48:23 about things that aren't commonly
48:26 believed by everyone in the world from
48:30 moon missions to the shape of the earth
48:33 whatever what's interesting is is when
48:38 you jump off on some of these things and
48:39 you're willing to start being public
48:41 about your opinion you're thinking big
48:43 it is you're risking everything your
48:46 credibility everything so you're the
48:48 kind of person that's willing to take
48:50 chances and that's an archetype of your
48:52 character as a human being you take
48:55 chances you know when you develop a
48:58 soldier in the world
48:59 the soldier is willing to fight any war
49:02 it doesn't matter and I know that's a
49:04 kind of a morbid example but they're
49:06 willing to defend their country against
49:08 whatever threats are perceived and
49:11 communicated to them will there be a
49:12 zombie apocalypse or they could get
49:14 bitten and turn into a zombie
49:16 I don't think any of our soldiers on an
49:18 in mass would run away from that war
49:20 they'd be like yeah all right we
49:22 understand just teach us how to kill
49:23 these things and give us equipment to
49:25 keep us safe and we'll go clean up risk
49:29 takers living bigger than life
49:33 imagine the perspective difference I
49:35 mean I mentioned this in the dimensional
49:38 realities one it still something is
49:39 starting to really ring true in my mind
49:42 as a profound thing that I think we're
49:44 all overlooking if we don't have this
49:47 happen directly to us I've got a lot of
49:51 friends that served in war from Army
49:53 Rangers to Navy SEALs to other folks
49:56 right they have seen and done things
49:59 that I will virtually never do my entire
50:03 lifetime they have succeeded at some of
50:07 the riskiest stuff jumped out of planes
50:09 parachuted down to air you know air
50:12 bases in Rock and had to deal with all
50:15 the soldiers that were there which are
50:16 elite guard so they're the most trained
50:18 guard being shot at at the ground with
50:21 anti-air guns that are supposed to take
50:24 planes out of the sky but then these you
50:25 know 20 Cal rounds are going by their
50:27 faces turn them inside out in a second
50:29 if they get hit they see their buddies
50:32 get hit and they keep going and then
50:35 that guy let's say the dudes like 28
50:38 years old or dudette they come home they
50:42 go to a coffee shop and they're being
50:45 you know they're being revered these
50:46 days instead of crap down like a Vietnam
50:48 thing but they come home and they go
50:52 into a coffee shop then they look around
50:54 the room and they see just kids their
50:58 age that have been in the town that
51:00 they're in their whole life they never
51:02 shipped out anywhere they've never had
51:04 their life threatened they've never
51:06 taken a life due to war what would be
51:09 the perspective difference of that
51:12 individual some of you are those
51:13 individuals there's this a massive gap
51:17 that you know about that they have no
51:20 clue and even that they might be able to
51:23 say I can only imagine they have no clue
51:26 even they're imagining
51:29 doesn't really drill at home I got a
51:31 pretty good mind I wouldn't claim to
51:34 have much more than a tiny double-digit
51:37 percentage and I would probably be
51:39 patting myself on the back a little too
51:41 hard to be able to go yeah I know what
51:43 it's like to be you know in the middle
51:44 of the night some marine with Rangers
51:48 and all other guys around them at
51:50 different divisions and they're all
51:51 coordinating and they're having to clean
51:53 up some airbase or something crazy right
51:56 and there's missions 50 times more
52:00 difficult to knows and our brothers and
52:03 sisters fathers and mothers best friends
52:05 they all go off and have done those
52:07 things you can get inspiration from
52:10 those people with your little goal here
52:13 in the country you're sitting there
52:16 going oh I don't think I can do this
52:17 through that you kinda you know you're
52:18 gonna have to fight your whiney nature
52:20 and that's just normal but they were
52:23 able to do damn near the impossible and
52:25 these people are around you constantly
52:28 okay
52:29 now let me throw some cautionary things
52:31 out there when you're setting your steps
52:34 your steps to go get this big thing of
52:36 yours there's a couple kisses of death
52:40 okay that you don't want to fall into
52:43 it's really easy I've made a couple
52:45 episodes about these sorts of things one
52:48 of the number one things you'll hear a
52:50 lot especially on the internet with
52:52 these get rich fast schemes as they lay
52:54 down this portfolio of people that have
52:56 made tremendous amounts of money with
52:58 this thing and you may even know someone
53:02 well this dude he just put some money in
53:05 Bitcoin and boom boom boom I got a very
53:07 close friend of mine he was done
53:09 extremely well the Bitcoin I was able to
53:10 tell me other day I said look even you
53:13 mean I said you know you know that if I
53:15 wanted to be in your shoes I can't be in
53:17 your shoes you were there when Bitcoin
53:19 dropped and you were so smart
53:22 that you invested in something that
53:24 looked like it might be a bunch of crap
53:28 but it it isn't right all right but
53:34 you'll also so that's one realm which I
53:37 called the lottery ticket life right
53:38 you're seeing someone do something
53:40 that's miraculous
53:42 and it's first-come first-serve and it's
53:46 usually out by the third person that
53:48 walks up the line right so don't fall
53:50 for that go for something that is
53:52 actually very realistic
53:55 hey if those opportunities come around
53:57 and you want to take a risk I'm gonna
53:59 have to hedge your bets right can't put
54:01 all of your money in Bitcoin if you need
54:04 money to operate on not everybody takes
54:07 it just yet and that's probably gonna
54:09 change okay good so hedge your bets with
54:12 that kind of thing the other thing that
54:15 the millionaire man didn't mention in
54:18 his class and there's been books written
54:19 about this which is the opportunity of a
54:24 lifetime happens to people sometimes and
54:26 they just happen to be in the right
54:30 place at the right time and it all falls
54:32 together
54:33 and they make a tremendous amount of
54:35 money doing that thing now every single
54:38 one of you can be one of those people
54:40 I'm not saying that you can but you need
54:43 to understand that you can't necessarily
54:44 set the goal to go get those miraculous
54:47 situations what you can do is build your
54:49 skill set so intensely and so broadly
54:52 and diversified that as things present
54:56 themselves you got skills in that you
54:58 got skills in this you got skills in
55:00 this other thing and when you drop on it
55:02 you can get in deeper than anyone else
55:04 very quickly an example would be I think
55:09 Steve Jobs is a better example and I
55:11 also think that Bezos is a better
55:13 example than rip everything off Bill
55:16 Gates but there's there's even a logic
55:18 to being a ripoff artist but Steve
55:21 Wozniak Steve Jobs they see the bubble
55:26 coming of amazing consumption of
55:30 personal computers this is gonna be a
55:31 wave they were going to these little
55:33 clubs in Cupertino and Los Altos and
55:36 watching people buy kits and set them up
55:38 and woz next line came in I can build
55:41 one of these things pre-made if you can
55:44 just sell Steve goes off and lands a
55:46 deal I think to sell 50 of these things
55:49 they're building them all in his house
55:51 and testing out all the chips to make
55:53 sure that works
55:53 they hocked a VW Bus
55:56 fan to pay for the actual cover and make
55:59 it look cool
56:00 eventually right place right time worked
56:04 their asses off didn't necessarily have
56:06 to do the ten years in the office thing
56:07 because within two years they had such a
56:10 hot item on their hands both of them
56:12 were multi millionaires original
56:15 engineering for the computer original
56:17 engineering for the software that's on
56:18 the computer okay go over to Bezos you
56:23 know he's the guy that everyone loves to
56:25 hate and I think most of its jealousy he
56:27 is a political like it seems he has a
56:30 political disposition that I I am very
56:32 much different from but the dude back in
56:35 1993 in 1893 saw the internet coming
56:39 said oh my god he had some hookup with
56:43 books
56:43 he could sell books I don't know if he
56:46 had a book store before whatever I
56:47 haven't looked up the guy and done a
56:48 deep dive yet but the guy said look if I
56:51 can just figure out how to take a credit
56:52 card online
56:53 I can sell books cuz I could ship them
56:56 directly to you well the banks weren't
56:58 even ready for merchant accounts like
57:00 you can just get a wordpress site the
57:02 WooCommerce plugins mmm all through your
57:06 bank or pay power whatever you can set
57:08 it all up online you don't have to call
57:10 anybody you have to have your bank
57:11 account of course and then you can hook
57:14 it up today no big deal
57:16 20 years later well for him it was a big
57:20 deal he fought tooth and nail and so
57:25 those books forever finally gets his
57:27 pipeline down and goes man I can sell
57:28 anything so he expands his offerings
57:32 first and then he realizes I can offer
57:34 this service to everyone in the world
57:35 look at eBay
57:37 everyone's selling stuff out of their
57:38 house but they're using this you know
57:40 Windows in T platform this guy wrote in
57:42 his basement in like Mountain View just
57:46 sell products all around the world he
57:47 gets a commission Wow thinking big right
57:53 okay Robert Kiyosaki guy wrote Rich Dad
57:56 Poor Dad I think I've only mentioned
57:59 this once out of 450 episodes he won
58:03 another book that is probably his most
58:07 it's his opus I mean it is
58:10 the best thing he's ever done and
58:12 everyone needs to read it just get it on
58:14 tape if you don't read you're busy it's
58:17 called cash quadrant and you look at the
58:21 cover and the cover has an e and s a B
58:25 and I you're in one of those four
58:29 categories that any one point in your
58:30 life and to the degree you understand
58:32 which category you're in you can build
58:34 your goals and think bigger in a much
58:37 better more efficient fashion what do
58:41 they stand for a means you're an
58:44 employee of someone else you're working
58:47 at a corporation a department store they
58:50 run your life they determine your hours
58:52 you are not after any of your own goals
58:55 you are after someone else's goals if I
58:59 went to Apple and worked as an engineer
59:00 my cousin is a chief engineer in an
59:03 apple right now I just learned that kid
59:07 works for Apple the Apple is kind of
59:10 cool internally they'll kind of inspire
59:12 them to think up their own things but in
59:14 the end it becomes a product of Apple
59:16 nothing wrong with that there's nothing
59:18 wrong with any one of these categories
59:20 if you're happy right now the other
59:24 quadrant is an S and this is a sole
59:28 proprietor business you work out of your
59:30 house you don't have any employees but
59:32 you're doing something for money and
59:33 it's paying the bills okay
59:36 that's like me being a writer yeah I'm
59:38 an S right now I've definitely been an e
59:42 I'm currently an S I've been asked
59:44 several times in my life next one over
59:47 is a B the B is a business owner now you
59:52 have probably an LLC S corp or C Corp
59:55 you have employees so now you are
59:58 becoming the thing that creates the ease
60:02 okay now just think about the career
60:04 path just with those three right away
60:06 you're an employee right now and you
60:08 want to up your game well you probably
60:10 want to become s before you become a B
60:12 because you need to get a product line
60:13 together find a service or product
60:15 you're going to give to someone else for
60:17 money you figure it all out you figure
60:19 out the pipeline you control the quality
60:21 experiences between you and the customer
60:23 let's say
60:24 to be a plumber or you're gonna be a
60:26 termite guy you're gonna do it by
60:29 yourself first because if you don't do
60:32 it by yourself you get an employee you
60:34 may not know how to train you may not
60:36 know what the process should be and the
60:39 whole thing will blow up in your face if
60:40 you go too quickly when you become a B
60:43 hopefully you've been the other two and
60:45 it's all old-school for you except that
60:48 now you're going to be a salesperson in
60:50 your whole life your job is to go find
60:53 the business I need to have people
60:55 underneath a that you trust and take
60:57 advice from Steve Jobs hire only a
61:00 players what's the different definition
61:03 of an a player they're potentially
61:06 better than you at everything and you
61:09 got to have the balls to hire someone
61:10 that's better than you because they tend
61:13 to go on autopilot a lot of people have
61:16 gigantic egos when they run their
61:17 businesses whether or not they even
61:19 recognize it or not I talked to a guy
61:20 earlier this year see if I could work
61:22 for him loved his company that's why I
61:26 agreed to interview at his place total
61:29 narcissist thinks small specifically
61:33 think smallest has made tens of millions
61:35 of dollars but he thinks like a little
61:36 ant it's funny I could just see the end
61:39 of his business just talking to him and
61:41 he had already reached his threshold
61:43 hilarious right don't be that guy and I
61:48 got a lot of episodes in season one in
61:50 the owner sort of business area that
61:53 will help you be a B and I can save you
61:55 a lot of time in I can save you you know
61:58 how allocates stock options what type of
62:00 corporation to create all that good
62:02 stuff now
62:05 I saved I for last because the AI is the
62:07 most misunderstood role that you can
62:11 have when they can big what's an AI well
62:16 the layman's sort of understanding of an
62:20 investor which is what I stands for is
62:24 that they kind of sit around waiting for
62:25 opportunities to be brought to them and
62:27 then they do that sort of Shark Tank
62:29 thing or they look around at it and
62:31 they're like how much do you need okay
62:35 fasty needed and you're gonna do one
62:37 round two round three rounds of seating
62:39 money into the company and you're
62:40 getting more and more shares and so
62:42 you're probably owned the company by the
62:43 time it's all over but you're really
62:45 waiting for other people to have dreams
62:47 before you can have any money back any
62:50 return of investment or ROI right but
62:53 that's not what an AI is that's the side
62:57 job of an AI to sit around and wait for
63:00 things to be brought to them a real AI
63:04 is a combination of pretty much all the
63:07 letters together with one little change
63:09 you go out and make those opportunities
63:13 possible from from nothing right give an
63:18 example when I founded with Richard
63:21 Taylor three space VR which was our
63:26 theatre technology that was again it's
63:28 going to replace your movie theatre with
63:31 a projector with the screen that is LED
63:33 high-definition direct LED technology
63:35 and well you know Richard had had this
63:41 idea for a while and some people that
63:42 had the idea but no one ever moved on it
63:44 that's the cool I mean that's the big
63:45 difference between sitting around
63:47 dreaming about it and getting it to
63:48 happen
63:49 we got a screen put together we got it
63:52 hosted inside of the basement floor of
63:54 the third floor company the previous
63:56 Hollywood company downtown LA just down
63:59 from the Academy just down from the
64:00 Petersons car museum and the yeah the
64:03 Academy of Arts Museum that's being
64:05 built down there and we toured a hundred
64:08 and thirty of the top Hollywood people
64:11 through it but now there was a
64:14 requirement with replacing any movie
64:16 theater screen which was
64:17 three-dimensional images because hey
64:20 everyone soir movie comes in it's 3d you
64:22 can have a technology that's not gonna
64:24 do 3d well no one had really done it
64:27 before so we pushed the manufacturer of
64:32 two or three different technologies to
64:35 work harder to give us the methodology
64:37 to flicker the screen with active
64:39 glasses realizing that active glasses
64:43 are about you know anywhere for $35 to
64:45 50 bucks a pair and the only theater
64:48 that's going to host such a
64:49 thing would be like a very closed system
64:51 where you go in you're given your
64:53 glasses they had to be charged up
64:54 they're very expensive you have to
64:56 figure out how many were gonna get
64:57 broken because they are very fragile so
65:01 we knew that that wasn't going to be the
65:04 end product but this would sell the
65:06 technology and the idea to Hollywood in
65:08 general so he brought through all these
65:10 special effects studios folks
65:11 I mean we're blowing mines every day for
65:15 at least six to eight hours a day okay
65:20 what did we need to really get it done
65:22 right we needed passive 3d those
65:25 cardboard glasses that you have but
65:28 direct LED can't do right now passive 3d
65:33 so start working with another gentleman
65:35 who understood it completely
65:38 unfortunately was connected to some
65:40 folks that did not understand it at all
65:42 and we developed some film that we could
65:48 put on top of an LED got all the way
65:51 down at one point nine millimeter LED
65:52 switch didn't feed away his
65:54 photorealistic man and gorgeous
65:57 unbelievable so anything bigger than
65:59 that no problem so we covered it with
66:02 the film such that every individual LED
66:05 light had left and right eye and a
66:08 spherical 3d filter we invented what we
66:12 needed to get done problem LEDs are
66:18 simply too expensive right now the
66:20 theaters would cost too much the other
66:25 problem the technology that broadcasts
66:27 it to the screen isn't secure so we had
66:31 to I completely laid out this entire
66:33 technological plan that would lock this
66:36 image down straight to the LED itself
66:39 totally encrypted to the LED but that
66:43 was going to cost a tremendous amount of
66:44 money and need some time to develop my
66:48 investor was the money man he was
66:53 looking at the pipeline of all the
66:56 different manufacturers and realized
66:57 that the one guy that could make the
66:59 screen the way we needed it that we
67:01 could have we eventually did get the
67:03 film on
67:03 at one point his company's completely
67:06 rely unreliable he was unreliable as a
67:08 person
67:09 and so there's no other manufacturer out
67:12 there that can make an LED printed
67:16 circuit board they could have the film
67:19 on it so we're all stuck behind the
67:21 eight-ball constantly and then Hollywood
67:24 needs to buy into it so they'll
67:26 authorize movies to be on it remember
67:28 when you put in that DVD to gives you
67:30 big FBI warning well there's an
67:32 organization behind that called DCI that
67:35 controls all this well they're they're
67:39 getting better but they've been some old
67:40 dogs for a really long time they're
67:43 looking at it it'll take five to ten
67:45 years for them just to get the security
67:46 protocols authorized for the FBI and the
67:51 idea of this screen was that we're gonna
67:52 bring it around you 220 degrees so you
67:54 had peripheral vision for the first time
67:56 in a movie in 3d so if an object came a
68:00 big tiger came up on your right side in
68:02 the jungle book you would freak out
68:04 because it's in your peripheral vision
68:05 you look backwards because it's 210
68:08 degrees back the screen never stops for
68:10 your eyeball you can walk right out of
68:12 the back of the theater it would have
68:15 been amazing and it will be amazing once
68:17 we get through all these hurdles maybe
68:19 I'll reintroduce myself to the
68:20 technology but I'll be 60 before it
68:23 happens that's an eye that's thinking
68:27 big
68:28 that's inventing something but there's
68:31 risks right now here's the good news the
68:36 good news is the more tangible your goal
68:39 is and the more personable it is to you
68:42 the less risk you're actually taking
68:44 what am i imma give an example you know
68:49 I had sat at home like I said four hours
68:51 a day for a couple years to get my
68:53 skills up on the internet to transition
68:54 without losing any money relatively
68:56 speaking okay well what if the internet
68:59 flopped okay no big deal put my all my
69:03 ducks in that or some of my ducks in
69:05 that you know row over there didn't work
69:08 out while I'm still an expert at this
69:10 other stuff I was already diversified
69:13 you can have that same sort of parachute
69:17 when you're taking your personal risks
69:20 now I recently posted on our Facebook
69:22 page this just random video I found
69:24 watching YouTube or late at night and
69:27 the video is about a guy who got an
69:32 electron microscope which I had to go
69:36 look this up because I've been told
69:37 electron microscopes of a very high
69:39 definition
69:41 like molecule level electron microscopes
69:44 you can't own personally there are too
69:46 expensive anyway but you have to
69:47 register with the government through a
69:49 university what the hell you're looking
69:50 for because they don't want you just
69:52 messing around
69:53 it's really interesting but this guy had
69:56 one that could look at a photographic
69:57 needle in the groove of a wax record and
70:00 he did it was utterly brilliant I mean
70:03 you should go look this up just go to
70:05 our Lux Facebook group the link is on
70:07 deep thoughts radio.com and check this
70:10 out because then he looked at the
70:11 grooves that are in a CD grooves that
70:17 are in a DVD player but he also pulled
70:20 out the first RCA home theater system I
70:25 remember these things just before
70:26 laserdisc came out and you know beta had
70:30 already succeeded three-quarter-inch
70:31 definitely succeed in broadcasting and
70:33 VHS was catching up as everybody was
70:36 going for this cheaper smaller more
70:39 compact cartridge and it could use like
70:41 we all did right but they had this like
70:44 this cartridge that was flat like a
70:46 record and inside they had developed
70:49 this amazing technology look like a
70:51 record sorta but if you pulled it out
70:54 what you're never supposed to do and you
70:56 shined in the light it was like a black
70:58 sort of rainbow mirror I mean it's
71:00 tremendous and what they did was in bed
71:03 inside the surface of this record as I
71:05 understand it a positive and negative
71:07 charge such that it could create digital
71:10 data that then I think it's digital
71:14 it's sort of an analog digital
71:15 combination to project a movie into your
71:18 TV it's super high definition and of
71:20 course laserdisc is what blu-ray is
71:23 today it's just a much bigger version of
71:25 it
71:25 but RCA I guess Spence from the late 60s
71:31 to the early 80s developing this
71:33 technology before it actually got into
71:35 the living rooms of people and so there
71:37 was this paradigm shift that was going
71:39 on both platforms failed laserdisc
71:41 failed and this RCA thing failed however
71:45 the RCA thing was as the guy said in the
71:47 video was dead on arrival because it was
71:51 cumbersome expensive expensive to just
71:54 duplicate the thing let alone for you to
71:57 buy it and it worked well but there were
72:00 alternatives that were just as good so
72:03 he lost everything had my investor given
72:07 my partner and I Richard 10 million
72:11 dollars to build this company he we
72:14 could have stretched it and probably put
72:15 something together would have been more
72:18 active than passive but we could have
72:19 some nice fine theaters where you would
72:21 go and pay 50 bucks a ticket to see a
72:23 movie in a way that you have never seen
72:25 it in your life
72:25 by the way 3d on an LED screen is the
72:29 most breathtaking thing you've ever seen
72:31 in your life when I've said this several
72:32 times and shows but wait for it you know
72:36 if you want to start eating healthy so
72:38 that you can see it in the future it's
72:40 probably a decent reason to do so but we
72:42 would have run into the manufacturer
72:44 having all kinds of ethical problems and
72:49 so we'd have to go to some other led
72:50 manufacturer and hope that we can get
72:52 something similarly made without running
72:54 into the other guys patents it's a
72:57 detailed process it's painstaking it
73:00 hurts it makes partners yell at each
73:02 other every once in a while and it's
73:04 really not personal it's just everyone
73:05 venting their frustration but that's
73:09 sometimes the prices you pay when you
73:11 think big but I'm giving you this
73:12 painful eye scenario of my own personal
73:16 life so that when you retreat back to a
73:19 B or an S it seems much easier you're
73:22 like Oh woof
73:23 least I'm not making that crap right and
73:25 so I'm hoping this sort of gets you to
73:31 think about things in your life and you
73:34 know the thing is is if you hear this
73:36 and you're like well I really don't have
73:37 anything I really want to do I'm totally
73:38 happy
73:39 you know and maybe it's not glamorous
73:41 what I'm doing but I'm happy man oh man
73:44 you need to know if your humble narrator
73:46 thinks that you are already there you're
73:50 just listening to the rest of us try to
73:52 figure it out you know you can hit the
73:55 lottery and be Steve Jobs - Steve
73:57 Wozniak and create the Apple Computer
73:58 but you can also hit the lottery and
74:00 your life is selling fishing poles man
74:03 and you're just happy as a clam
74:06 button matter if you're happy and you
74:08 know it stick to it right just be aware
74:12 the careers today will very often have
74:16 expiration dates that no one knows the
74:19 end of that the net they don't know when
74:21 it's going to take place ask anybody in
74:24 1985 if they thought Betamax was going
74:27 to disappear in five years my dad
74:32 wouldn't have believed it I probably
74:33 wouldn't believe it either and we had
74:35 beta primarily in my house we also have
74:37 VHS the beta was better it was smaller
74:40 as a nice smaller cassette it was all
74:43 done with Sony technology and Sony's
74:46 route you know Sony is like famous for
74:48 creating technology and then hoarding it
74:51 and then losing it's just wow it's
74:55 really sad but now there's this other
74:59 thing as I close up here I made the
75:03 episode about the fact that your mind
75:05 erases time if it's boring well if you
75:09 love what you do you're never gonna have
75:11 that feeling you're just living in one
75:12 nice great day
75:14 there's no such thing as mundane you
75:15 like what you do so don't worry about it
75:17 they're in that state but let's say
75:20 you're you know you are in a career that
75:21 you know in the five ten years probably
75:24 well I'll need to switch to something
75:25 else and so the cool thing is did you
75:27 kind of go around life looking around
75:28 what do you do for a living
75:30 how hard is it to get in that you got
75:33 any positions how hard is it to train
75:35 dadada and you just keep looking around
75:37 YouTube oh my lord that is the new
75:39 University I think one could get
75:43 depending on exactly what we're talking
75:46 about here not quite a PhD level
75:49 education in something but
75:52 for these careers that don't need phd's
75:54 likes a special effects you don't need a
75:57 PhD you don't even need a degree just
75:59 get really good at something at a
76:02 broadcast level quality meaning movie
76:06 quality television quality which is all
76:08 4k these tools it doesn't even matter
76:10 you can just dial in and what resolution
76:12 you want your stuff comes out at that
76:13 resolution right our intros in 4k it
76:19 spices up your life it gives you sort of
76:22 this well I don't know what I'm gonna be
76:24 this decade kind of thing and you know
76:27 you get through the end of your life
76:28 where you're gonna retire chill out and
76:31 you look back at your life do you like
76:33 man yeah I was a musician for that ten
76:36 years I did video games for that 25
76:39 years I did this I did that blah blah
76:41 blah that's at the end your life you're
76:42 kinda like yeah I got no regrets you
76:45 know yeah I missed a bunch of careers I
76:47 could have hunkered down in maybe I
76:49 would have made no money in it maybe
76:51 your opinion completely changes and
76:52 you're like man I'm glad I didn't go
76:53 into that so instead of perceiving
76:56 anything as fear perceiving anything as
76:58 an obstacle that's not fun obstacle just
77:03 the more you conquer things the easier
77:07 it gets
77:07 it sets the precedence in your mind that
77:10 you have this capability one of the
77:13 greatest examples I've ever heard about
77:14 a guy walking into a room and getting a
77:18 whole group of people twelve people to
77:22 do something they never thought they
77:23 could do with Steve Jobs walking in the
77:25 room pick an 81 or 82 you put a book on
77:30 the table and he goes that's it right
77:32 there
77:32 and they're like what are you talking
77:34 about and he goes you see the footprint
77:36 this thing has on the on the table they
77:39 said yeah and he goes that's how big I
77:42 want this computer to be you can build
77:44 it straight up but no higher than this
77:47 no wider no deeper and it became the
77:50 Macintosh the first 1984 Macintosh that
77:52 released they thought they couldn't do
77:55 it the PC the personal computer being
77:58 released by IBM and all the other
78:01 computers were like these keyboard
78:03 shapes you know of course he did allow
78:05 the keyboard to be
78:05 attached to it through a little coil
78:07 wire so that helped but they ended up
78:10 making the motherboard go up vertically
78:13 on the inside of the Macintosh there was
78:16 one at the base too so sort of like this
78:18 l-shaped thing but now what what is the
78:22 configuration of a Windows machine in
78:24 most cases no one has I'm lying down we
78:26 haven't had them lying down or for
78:28 twenty years they're all vertical no
78:32 it's kind of cool the Macintosh was one
78:34 of the first computers to make something
78:36 vertical not technically the Cray
78:37 computer was very vertical but it was
78:39 also sideways and upside down all kinds
78:41 of stuff but when challenged it's
78:44 amazing what the mind can do just
78:48 remember the universe has your back but
78:52 you got to be a good critic of your own
78:53 capabilities right there's plenty of
78:55 tone-deaf kids going into you know
78:57 American Idol auditions over and over
79:01 and over again some of them get better
79:04 over time even though they're not
79:05 qualified to get on the show you can at
79:07 least see the Delta and some of them are
79:09 just as tone-deaf the first day as they
79:11 are 5 years later so make sure that you
79:15 can sing in tune and that's just a
79:17 metaphor for everything you do a lot of
79:21 things either work or they don't work
79:22 and that's what's great you want to
79:24 build circuitry well it's either
79:25 couldn't work it's not gonna work later
79:27 you can refine it make it smaller better
79:29 whatever use less power your faster
79:32 chips miniaturize whatever it's a
79:36 process and it's fun if you're in
79:38 control and if it's part of that little
79:40 goal you've got in your mirror in the
79:42 bathroom so there you go hopefully that
79:46 was helpful but if you haven't been to
79:49 deep thoughts radio.com please go I'm
79:51 gonna make it a short bumper today
79:52 there's two video least two or three
79:55 audio there's three social media there's
80:00 two ways to donate directly and there's
80:02 a couple little products I want you to
80:03 have take a look at those and there's
80:05 the all-new Rhys Masters season one you
80:08 will not find season one on this channel
80:10 I just gotta keep saying that so no one
80:12 says anything now that I've been saying
80:13 it I haven't been getting any comments
80:16 about where these videos are so that's
80:17 good and I'm getting a lot of comments
80:19 the season 1 episodes and again they
80:22 still work if you've got them embedded
80:23 somewhere it's just I don't put them
80:26 live because they got all kinds of
80:28 copyright strikes on them so anyway take
80:31 care of yourself in someone else and I
80:32 will see you in the next deep thoughts
80:34 over now
