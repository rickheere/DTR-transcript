00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen season five here I'm recording
00:36 these ahead of time before I get the
00:37 intro all worked out got to keep going I
00:41 can't keep doing bonus bonus episodes I
00:45 put out the the new kind of serious set
00:51 of bonuses out for the first time this
00:53 2019 part of it's just a bunch of time
00:56 related NASA stuff which i think is
00:58 important now I tried an episode which
01:02 you'll see called Coral Castle which I
01:05 filmed myself straight ahead and for
01:07 whatever reason the camera went out of
01:10 focus pretty much the whole episode so
01:12 anyway today I thought we would discuss
01:17 this notion of talking to the universe
01:20 and some of us could easily say God one
01:26 of the same some of you that don't
01:30 believe in organized religion for you
01:33 it's very important to call your creator
01:36 the universe at best right amen if
01:39 you're an atheist who believes in the
01:40 Big Bang then the universe created you
01:43 that's what you believed there was
01:45 nothing and then BOOM
01:48 however there was a something very
01:50 interesting idea as we have discussed
01:54 several times but I just watched a
01:57 friend of mine do a video on Facebook
02:01 and she had mentioned something that I
02:05 think is she mentioned it very
02:07 nonchalantly which I thought was really
02:09 cool and she said you know I was at this
02:12 location and I didn't know why I was
02:15 there
02:15 and so I asked God you know why am I
02:18 here why did why did I even come here
02:21 you know and then she said she got an
02:26 answer she's got an answer to do
02:28 something very specific something that
02:31 will benefit the country of America if
02:34 she were to be successful
02:37 and I think that's cool because a lot of
02:40 people are like man if I said I talked
02:41 to God and I got an answer back then I'm
02:44 crazy and the idea is is that you'll
02:49 probably be called crazy for two
02:51 different two completely different
02:52 reasons even though it's the same
02:54 eventualities that somehow you're you're
02:57 nuts
02:58 and it would be one person can't
03:02 possibly conceive of doing that and so
03:06 they truly feel the guttural almost
03:09 instinct to laugh okay remember laughing
03:12 is two concept in your mind that come
03:14 together that make no sense and laughter
03:17 is the psychological burp that happens
03:21 right the more you understand that the
03:23 more you can write a gag in a movie or
03:25 write comedy you've got to bring two
03:27 things together and the more that you
03:30 can compound that and build it and and
03:32 bring it back later you'll have some
03:33 beautiful irony as well
03:36 but the other part of the the group
03:38 would be I think perhaps a group that
03:43 would call you crazy because there's
03:44 gonna be people that totally go with you
03:46 on the journey oh yeah really okay cool
03:48 totally right but some people will call
03:53 you crazy because they're jealous and
03:55 deep down inside they they want the same
03:59 ability and for whatever reason they're
04:01 not getting it as frequent as they would
04:03 like or ever and so they just spit on
04:07 you basically emotionally but now let's
04:11 look back in history as to what was
04:14 documented and what we see in children
04:18 today okay every time I go back on
04:22 subjects have talked about I always
04:23 think about geez do I repeat myself or
04:26 do I try to figure out where to refer
04:29 people and I always end up repeating
04:31 myself because I think it's the cleanest
04:32 way to do this Stanford University has
04:36 done several tests on children and their
04:40 psychic capabilities their abilities to
04:41 communicate with adults or anyone the
04:45 younger that they are versus the older
04:47 that they are and about five years old
04:49 it starts to get
04:50 very close to 21 percent of the tests
04:55 come up correct which means utter
05:00 randomness okay the younger you go below
05:04 4 I think it got up into the upper 40s
05:09 definitely the lower 40s where children
05:11 were able to predict the color predict a
05:15 toy predict whatever is on the flash
05:17 card and so we establish in this way of
05:22 living in the human body way of living
05:24 that we have to be psychic with our
05:27 parents because we can't communicate so
05:29 we are using our psychic abilities to
05:32 figure out if we're loved whether the
05:34 foods on its way whether you know
05:36 whatever weather we need to behave a
05:38 certain way this has been proven and I'm
05:44 only aware of the Stanford one because
05:45 the woman I worked with who was the
05:47 manager of our department had her kid in
05:51 this thing so now pull back look at man
05:56 versus our Father God or the universe
06:00 itself and I'm just using a male gender
06:02 for the sake of tradition or you know
06:05 arguing over things right God is a
06:07 creator women have wombs they're the
06:10 ones that birth us so there's quite a
06:12 bit argument either way but God seems to
06:17 have in history but documented and I'm
06:20 not I'm not a big believer in this but
06:22 documented his being around a lot
06:25 showing up Lily is he's like a drunk
06:28 he's just sitting out there and then bar
06:30 you know it's good yeah yeah hey you
06:32 what yeah kill your kid what kill your
06:36 kid why well because I want you to and
06:39 if you believe in me
06:40 hiccup and you know kill your kid and
06:43 then he's not total [ __ ] so the guy
06:46 goes up to kill his child and I'm just
06:48 getting don't kill your kid what are you
06:49 crazy dumb human he walks off you know
06:53 so that's the old version of God but
06:55 think about the logistical part of it
06:58 where you have a new creature Homo
07:00 sapiens sapiens we seem to pop out of
07:02 [ __ ]
07:03 we're right they keep saying oh it was a
07:06 female in upper New Africa and say well
07:10 maybe maybe it was so if you were to
07:17 create something well an AI if you
07:20 create an artificial intelligence look
07:21 at the the things that we've done the
07:23 real world look at the fictional story
07:25 Westworld philip k dick spoke you know
07:29 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
07:31 which was turned into Blade Runner sing
07:34 the body electric out of Twilight Zone
07:36 they realized that at some point they're
07:39 going to have to gift artificial life
07:41 with memories some sort of beginning to
07:45 give them orientation unless we walk
07:48 around in a damn near infinite pool of
07:52 the variable consciousness you know a
07:55 consciousness that grows like a crystal
07:57 it imperative Lee grows with no rhyme or
08:02 reason until at some serendipitous
08:05 moment rhyme and reason and love and
08:06 hate all form itself right that's for me
08:10 the sort of ludicrous emotion our sorry
08:13 evolutional side of emotion we have a
08:19 hard time conceiving of love being an
08:23 actual force in the universe and just
08:25 like a comedian said my can't my cat
08:28 can't conceive of the internet and I
08:32 think that's great I think it was Dane
08:33 Cook or someone like that but somebody
08:35 said you know I can't
08:36 my cat can't conceive of the Internet at
08:38 thus we typically struggle with the
08:42 concept that love is an actual force in
08:45 the universe that is actually a
08:46 substance and it has intelligence and it
08:49 is special because it is love you know
08:53 there's the mother several movies but
08:56 you know Prometheus has it abyss sorry I
09:00 had something like it but liquids with
09:02 intelligence liquids with IQs liquids
09:06 with memories liquids that have high of
09:07 minds with other liquids are all liquids
09:09 you know for me it's interesting the
09:13 idea that anyone can talk to
09:17 god you can decide to talk to God any
09:20 moment most of us who have some sort of
09:24 religious paradigm upbringing
09:26 thus God metaphor in our brain do speak
09:30 to God regardless if we ever hear
09:32 anything back or have a sign or life
09:34 changes for the positive or the negative
09:37 we still do it and then you have kids
09:40 that are raised in the secular families
09:42 where there was no religion and you have
09:45 no concept of God and usually the kids
09:49 believe that they are more intelligent
09:53 if they can tell you that they don't
09:55 believe in God and that what's
09:58 interesting is is you tell them look
10:01 that's cool
10:02 you know you could be right but tell me
10:05 where does energy go in the universe
10:07 once it ceases to become human and
10:10 they'll say you know it disperses it
10:14 diffuses into the universe it just
10:16 spreads out and turns into something
10:18 else it's a huge recycling bin of mass
10:20 and energy and what have you and then
10:24 you say well why do some people feel
10:26 like they have old souls why are some
10:28 people born and to children right kids
10:32 that are in their teens will have
10:34 children and their children seem like
10:36 they're Wisel men or women they didn't
10:40 get raised in a household with super
10:41 mature parents and yet these kids happen
10:45 I mean they typically have a bunch of
10:48 kids that are just like them but the one
10:50 I'm gonna pop out and you're like oh my
10:52 god there's Frank Sinatra right there
10:54 there's a Madame Curie right there and
10:56 King Tut over there make you just feel
10:57 it off of them that there's some sort of
10:59 chieftain gene how is it that these
11:02 people get born and they know villages
11:05 where they were and by the way something
11:07 occurred to me in that for those of you
11:09 who study people who have died and come
11:11 back from come back to life or actually
11:14 sorry it's not even that group apologize
11:16 kids that are born with memories of
11:19 living in different places
11:24 and so they wake up and they're like hey
11:26 well I'm glad I'm here but I'm actually
11:27 from that village over there and so they
11:29 take the kid to that village and the
11:31 kids like naming off names and they
11:33 won't have everything right but they get
11:35 a lot right and they do have the
11:36 relative picked out that died that
11:38 became them well that was me
11:40 and again there was a kid in England who
11:43 fingered a lighthouse estate and he said
11:49 that's where he was from but there'll be
11:51 these mistakes where they're trying to
11:53 get names we're trying to get
11:54 circumstances right and it just occurred
11:56 to me that if we are in a universe that
12:00 that has all eventualities stacked up on
12:04 each other in some you know infinite
12:06 quantum frequency catalog of everything
12:08 that could happen does happen even
12:12 though these people are reinserting
12:14 themselves generally where they were in
12:16 time and space on planet earth this
12:22 could be a situation where they actually
12:23 slip to a slightly different chapter
12:26 slightly different version of the same
12:28 chapter I should say and so now the
12:30 names have changed that people have
12:31 changed and the places have changed a
12:33 little bit like a Mandela effect sort of
12:35 thing you know the Mandela effect is
12:38 super interesting for me that we do have
12:42 global mistakes and data there's really
12:46 what at a minimum it has to be a big
12:50 group decides it was one way another big
12:53 group decides it was another way and
12:55 then we're all literally mystified but
12:59 again what's interesting with the
13:03 Mandela facts is they'll pick little
13:04 Bendele effects that seem to be
13:06 ridiculous a single word that changes in
13:09 the name of a book title like a a turns
13:12 into it the and you're kinda like well
13:14 you know I don't really pay attention to
13:16 every a and the okay but Berenstein and
13:20 Berenstain that's a little bit different
13:23 okay but the one is start Wars Star Wars
13:27 Empire Strikes Back no I'm your father
13:30 versus Luke I'm your father
13:34 you know technically speaking if you've
13:35 watched the dialogue it does seem to
13:37 this timeframe right now I don't know
13:40 how we even put a stamp on this reality
13:42 to say we're content frequency boom but
13:46 now I'm your father makes more sense the
13:47 way the dialogues written today but you
13:49 have James Earl Jones
13:50 Mark Hamill all saying Luke I'm your
13:52 father for 40 years right technically
13:57 about 39 38 years right to came out 1980
14:01 okay that's a long time to have a
14:03 mistake and and you know where are the
14:07 Nerds where are the nerds who memorized
14:09 every single line who've seen these
14:10 movies 500 to a thousand times looking
14:14 at it online going to these conferences
14:16 putting the mics up in the faces of
14:18 these two gentlemen and then they say
14:20 the line Luke no Luke I'm your father
14:22 and nobody corrects them I mean just go
14:27 watch was the bliz cons were the
14:31 creators of World of Warcraft are trying
14:33 to talk about the story to kids that are
14:36 sitting on the open mikes asking
14:38 questions and they're like no you're
14:40 wrong this happened this happened this
14:42 happened and the creators of the game
14:43 we're looking at you like oh Christ did
14:45 I get that wrong yeah it's our game when
14:47 I can't remember what the hell happened
14:48 because their lure is so ridiculously
14:51 complex right by the way I forgot to say
14:54 I've waited a long time to be out here
14:57 in the Sun when it's nice and hot and
14:59 today in late July summers finally
15:02 arrived in Southern California actually
15:04 takes forever but then it hangs around
15:06 for quite a bit it's been freezing this
15:09 year so now let's go to the second sort
15:15 of phase of this concept why did we talk
15:19 to God I think there's several reasons
15:22 why I think that isolation is probably
15:27 the biggest catalyst you could be
15:31 without ton of people in your family and
15:34 your circle of friends and still feel
15:36 extremely isolated with one struggle
15:38 that you're having that no one else
15:39 seems to understand so a lot of times
15:43 you'll be you could even be at a party
15:47 and you let's just create a fictional
15:50 scenario you're in love with somebody
15:53 who's not there you'd rather be with
15:55 that person but there's someone else
15:57 that's close by and they're pretty great
16:00 too and so you know this person's right
16:06 there
16:07 smiling big and and you're like oh my
16:10 god what am I gonna do and you're
16:11 surrounded by all your friends if you're
16:12 a girl you're spending all your
16:13 girlfriends if you're dude you're
16:15 surrounded by your guy friends and
16:16 they're kind of all going - what's your
16:18 problem why don't you go with him or her
16:20 or whatever they're perfect for you and
16:23 they're unaware you've got something in
16:24 the background in your brain so you're
16:27 starting to feel super isolated in that
16:28 situation you might go to the bathroom
16:30 stall go for a walk go on a balcony
16:34 someplace by yourself and just quickly
16:37 have a conversation with God and Jessica
16:40 what do I do
16:41 what do I do I want to make a mistake I
16:44 don't want to lead someone on could you
16:46 cancel one out so one sticks out the
16:48 best God you know may or may not help
16:52 you maybe it's a choice you have to make
16:56 this time around sometimes we're in
16:59 absolute duress and we need help and
17:04 there is no one there to help you you
17:07 could have parents and friends that
17:08 would help you if they could get next to
17:10 you but this point in time there's a
17:13 moment in time there's nobody there
17:14 you're driving a car late at night and
17:17 it starts wobbling on the bad road and
17:19 then sometimes everything's going right
17:22 it's going great and hopefully this is
17:24 the most common form of asking the
17:27 question which is or having a
17:29 conversation excuse me you simply say
17:31 thank you and god this is great
17:33 I love it I finally got it I got to come
17:37 through my goal my dream whatever or
17:39 just pure contentment is what you were
17:42 going for and you're like man I'm not
17:43 worried about anything my bills are paid
17:46 thank you now there's this big debate
17:51 when it comes to that sort of
17:53 communication with God because you'll
17:57 hear people say and I've said it a
17:59 hundred times which is
18:00 you know I talk to God all the time I
18:02 don't ask for much I just say thank you
18:05 for what I have and what's interesting
18:10 about that is that seems like the good
18:12 balance right say thanks
18:14 90% of the time a 90% the content that
18:17 you say to God and then 10% good put a
18:20 little request in for whatever the next
18:22 lottery tickets you want opportunity
18:25 understanding epiphany whatever it is
18:27 you're looking for but again what I do
18:30 to kind of decipher this stuff to the to
18:34 a new dimension in my own mind I'm not
18:36 saying I'm correct at all
18:38 but as I try to put myself into the
18:41 shoes of God and think about having aged
18:46 in eternity trying to think about what
18:51 what if any mysteries that God might
18:54 have that we might entertain you know if
18:57 there's infinite scenarios in the
19:00 universe well has God lived them all
19:02 simply because they exist and he exists
19:05 or does God limits himself where's God
19:08 force to be limited in his own paradigm
19:11 he can perhaps go and experience
19:15 everything that he wants to experience
19:16 but he can't he hasn't done it yet plus
19:19 we always give God this omnipotent power
19:21 right can't you can't say that God can't
19:25 do anything because if the God that
19:29 we're talking about has any limitations
19:31 whatsoever then then we tend to think
19:33 that's like a sub God a demigod and that
19:36 there's a god over that guy they can do
19:38 everything and you know the pure
19:40 definition of the lord is all-powerful
19:43 right but I started to occur to me that
19:46 I am treating God like he has a limited
19:51 wallet that he has limited resources and
19:55 that I'm only gonna ask for you know a
19:57 buck 20 in 2019 but then my brothers
20:01 over there asking for 20 bucks and my
20:04 sister's over there asking for a million
20:05 bucks and my dad's asking for a billion
20:08 and you sit there and you go
20:11 is there any logic to this game first I
20:16 think one of the funny things that we do
20:20 as human beings is that we think that
20:22 God is participating at some super
20:25 massively invasive level especially for
20:28 the Spoils that we enjoy as human beings
20:31 and the notion is well can't you easily
20:38 assess that the most evil people on
20:41 planet earth seem to have the most money
20:43 and there's some great people with money
20:45 as well but the most money is always
20:48 held by the biggest sociopathic
20:51 xenophobic scumbags on planet earth
20:54 putting money into a system to accuse
20:57 the rest of us who are actually getting
20:58 along with everyone of being those
21:00 things I mean do you think Lord
21:03 Rothschild wants to live in Jamaica any
21:05 time soon no does he want anyone of
21:09 color touching his food
21:10 no these people are the most incredibly
21:16 psychopathic you know racists on planet
21:19 earth but the spoils of the earth all of
21:23 the energy that God has put into the
21:26 earth whatever you believe in whatsoever
21:28 and evolution starts to become a very
21:32 tasty little cocktail when you start to
21:35 think about any intent on planet Earth
21:40 so you start to go well my God rewards
21:42 me if I follow what God does hmm I don't
21:46 know I know a lot of really good
21:48 god-fearing people who who have died
21:51 before they were fifty of like tough
21:54 diseases and things but they were almost
21:58 mother Teresa type characters male and
22:00 female didn't seem to help them I mean
22:03 is it is it a one-way ticket to heaven
22:06 is it like oh you're so good I'm gonna
22:08 have you up here why why would you want
22:10 them up there the real challenge is down
22:12 here to really find out who you are and
22:15 what you're made of it's down here why
22:18 make this place if it's so easy to go
22:20 well everybody who's good you just come
22:21 to him why was I birthed and
22:24 earth at all you knew I was gonna become
22:26 this because you're supposedly this big
22:28 omnipotent lee seol time at one second
22:32 creature I don't need to be born to go
22:34 through anything just take me straight
22:36 to the old pearly gates I think we know
22:41 that even though we don't know what's
22:42 going on completely that that ain't the
22:44 way it works right the survival of the
22:48 fittest serendipitous get a ruling class
22:54 that seems to gain all the money if
22:56 you're willing to literally step on the
22:58 head of someone in front of you kill off
23:01 a genocide a whole race because it
23:04 provides you with resources and gets rid
23:06 of one of your enemies that's how these
23:08 people work they've been doing it for
23:09 thousands of years it seems that that is
23:13 rewarded on earth more than anything
23:15 because that's exactly the precursor
23:18 that people have to the spoils the buddy
23:24 of mine again he had he's part of an
23:28 upper upper class family and he had me
23:31 do his family crest over which I'll
23:35 leave a mystery but in order to kind of
23:40 get my mind around the family history
23:43 they provided documentation back to I
23:46 think 1520 let me tell you this family
23:51 was they had earned their keep in one
23:54 way or another I mean they had to fight
23:56 gruesome Wars and the losses here and
23:59 there were phenomenal so I mean you know
24:02 they're not average joes at least back
24:05 in those days so there's this question
24:08 you know when you talk to God you're
24:11 usually asking for something as much as
24:14 you might smuggle in a bunch of
24:16 thank-yous and I appreciate this sort of
24:18 thing there's always something you
24:21 always say well you know thank you for
24:22 bringing us the preacher that we have
24:24 thank you for my wife you know please
24:27 keep the preacher awesome please leave
24:28 my wife or husband awesome please keep
24:30 protect my children or whatever it is
24:32 you're saying and then there's this
24:34 notion of I believe the episode I made
24:36 was called epoch of God
24:38 and that episode is about the notion
24:41 that God does show up in epoch turns the
24:45 sort of refresh humanity's faith in God
24:48 and to essentially not to not to
24:51 necessarily do that but that actually
24:53 occurs but you know the faith issue but
24:55 the idea is I'm here to set things
24:57 straight
24:57 you're still an evolving race yet
25:00 Rothchilds and you know clinton's and we
25:04 have to get rid of these people every
25:05 once in a while and I'll take these
25:06 Souls straight to [ __ ] hell you know
25:09 you have no idea how bad it is down
25:10 there but at all Oh get rid of these
25:12 folks recycle them the fire
25:19 rehabilitation center and then a more
25:22 subtle version that I put in the episode
25:24 was essentially the notion that what if
25:29 every I don't know 60 50 60 years maybe
25:34 100 years very special old souls are
25:38 sent to earth almost like an economy
25:40 like there's someone up there
25:41 distributing Souls and they're like okay
25:44 well we need to we need to get these new
25:46 Souls right out of the plastic bag and
25:49 you get them rolling you get them like
25:50 heating up the bun right and so they
25:52 sent them over to earth and we get you
25:54 know a o'seas kind of people right and
25:57 then we've got off you know here's
25:59 here's this whole stream of recently
26:02 lived Souls that did extremely well
26:05 their report cards are great and they
26:07 throw those in there and we get you know
26:08 amazing people your relatives maybe even
26:12 you been here a few times you're not
26:15 perfect but you get things at a higher
26:17 level what it fascinates me is you know
26:23 the elderly in my life when I was a
26:25 child in the 70s they just had a special
26:29 lucidity they lived through at least one
26:33 war you know my grandmother was born and
26:36 my grandfather were born at 1910 to 1912
26:40 so both of them lived through World War
26:43 one to the point they could remember it
26:44 definitely - they went through the
26:46 depression went through the Korean War
26:49 the Vietnam War
26:51 so they remember these things remember
26:53 how he started the remember what the
26:55 benefits were all the propaganda and
26:56 even if they didn't consciously remember
26:59 things because I never really got into
27:00 those kind of subject conversations with
27:03 them you still have this deep down deep
27:06 interior understanding of your life you
27:09 do and maybe you can't express it maybe
27:12 you can't react to it to improve your
27:14 life but it's there so part of this
27:18 notion of talking to God is that does
27:23 God hear you
27:24 does God respond to you some people are
27:29 extremely devout that when something
27:33 goes right after they say something to
27:37 God you think it's a sign from God and
27:42 it might be I'll give you an experience
27:44 I had last Monday I had just finished a
27:50 meeting with a potential client and this
27:54 client was one of those disappointing
27:55 clients where they just didn't get what
27:59 they needed and but they were so sure
28:01 what they needed and they were their
28:03 methodology was going to completely mess
28:06 up what they needed and so you know I
28:10 gracefully bowed out of the project just
28:12 going likes and then I thought I was
28:15 just sitting there going isn't that a
28:16 bummer God that you know people are like
28:17 this and what it would I said like where
28:21 where am i old Reese like my old buddies
28:25 and my old projects they used to have
28:26 where people had their [ __ ] together and
28:27 we could do something really monumental
28:29 and Lambert you know groundbreaking
28:31 excuse me and breaking I no sooner did I
28:36 say that then I got an email from a
28:38 friend of mine I haven't remotely talked
28:41 to for seven years haven't physically
28:43 seen in like 16 years he's a very very
28:47 special individual and so he's like it's
28:51 time and I'm like whoa
28:54 dude dude dude 10 minutes later we're
28:57 skyping and there's all kinds of
29:01 opportunity going back and forth
29:03 not only that but I've been wanting to
29:06 get back to Hawaii just for my sole sake
29:08 and he lives in a why and he's like
29:09 you're gonna have to get to get your ass
29:10 over here real soon I'm just like whoa
29:14 it seemed I had just had a conversation
29:16 with God and I'd really you know have
29:20 been bothering God that much so for me
29:22 it was like wow I stepped in had a
29:24 conversation boom email boom Skype boom
29:27 either today or tomorrow we're gonna go
29:30 to the next level with this thing but
29:33 there are circumstances where people
29:34 pray to God really profusely and it's
29:38 when someone is sick especially a young
29:42 person who's sick and you pray to God to
29:44 heal them and you get the whole church
29:48 and the whole community the whole
29:49 internet to pray for someone and
29:51 sometimes they live and sometimes they
29:54 pass when they live it's a boost for all
29:58 people's faith and God when they die you
30:03 know you almost have everyone just going
30:05 to cognitive dissonance look the other
30:06 way or a small slice will say well God
30:11 must have wanted this person up in
30:13 heaven and the truth of matter is I fear
30:17 is that it's a fear really but but I
30:19 think it's just he doesn't intervene
30:23 like that you know things happen you
30:27 know if you're eating toxic food and and
30:31 there's been an opportunity for you to
30:32 realize that the food's toxic and you
30:36 shouldn't feed it to your children I
30:38 mean any child gets cancer it's a
30:40 dietary problem that the family has in
30:42 the house for sure
30:44 it could be powerlines outside could be
30:47 the cell phone you give your kid
30:50 children should not be able to get the
30:53 super slow you know cancers that are out
30:57 there there once why I get a super
31:00 aggressive one but
31:04 vaccinations and horrible crap they
31:09 don't think about the way we were as
31:11 primitive man living off the land and
31:15 being so successful at it that we had
31:18 our population explode to the point
31:22 where now the ruling class are doing
31:25 everything to mess up your genders to
31:26 mess up your health to mess up your
31:29 productivity your reproductivity through
31:34 GMOs they want to vaccinate your kids
31:36 into mental [ __ ] retardation so that
31:39 they can't get a spouse it can't have a
31:41 kid it's it's a massive agenda the big
31:45 girl power movement in Hollywood is to
31:47 keep women for wear have women slash
31:50 girls prioritize their careers and
31:52 destiny over having children when I was
31:56 a kid women had both it was real simple
31:58 single income household so dad went off
32:00 and worked paid for all the bills mom
32:02 took care of the kids up to a point got
32:05 them into school you have latchkey kids
32:08 you know they got their kids nobody
32:09 there weren't perverts there absolutely
32:11 everywhere because porn wasn't
32:12 everywhere Krupp ting all the neighbors
32:14 mines so our kids didn't get snatched on
32:18 average right
32:19 you know once these politicians started
32:21 to get control after Kennedy was dead
32:25 the pedophilia went nuts and ten years
32:27 later in the 70s you know milk cartons
32:29 with kids started showing him where's
32:32 God you know maybe it's a god the whole
32:36 thing about death is well it's just a
32:38 face and so then you might say whoa Kate
32:41 God so let's say death is no big deal we
32:44 reincarnate forever so for you it's like
32:46 it's like the roller coaster crashed and
32:49 everybody died their limbs got cut off
32:52 now some people go on living after the
32:55 the roller coaster crash right they get
32:58 raped and abused as children by Jeffrey
33:00 Epstein and his friends and they
33:02 continue living so they're scarred for
33:04 life and perhaps they lived ninety to a
33:06 hundred years scarred and perhaps they
33:08 spread that scar everywhere because they
33:10 do it to other kids because I think
33:11 that's what's normal thus spreading a
33:15 virus of evil
33:16 onto this planet surface right so my big
33:23 question with that scenario is hey God
33:25 does does my soul remember torture you
33:29 know l ron Hubbard in the Scientology
33:31 group they think that they think that
33:33 you
33:34 they don't have original sin but their
33:36 replacement for original sin to keep you
33:38 going into consulting sessions forever
33:40 is look for your previous life sins look
33:43 for your previous life traumas and so
33:47 they take maybe sent off and put trauma
33:49 in there and then you're constantly
33:50 broken for-fucking-ever which is what
33:52 every church tries to get you to believe
33:55 every consulting group tries to get you
33:57 to believe that you know Tony Robbins
33:59 group is pretty cool but they'll tell
34:01 you that you're never gonna know all of
34:03 what you need to know so you have to
34:04 come back you have to come back you have
34:05 to come back there's a group in LA
34:07 called landmark they do some good work
34:09 but they also keep you broken keep you
34:12 broken I once met with a guy there and I
34:15 was told later he was a super bad person
34:18 to talk to to try and get a perspective
34:21 of what the group does but he was trying
34:25 to psychoanalyze me of all [ __ ]
34:27 people right I mean you'd need to be a
34:29 PhD level psychiatrist to get in that
34:33 realm with me you just absolutely have
34:34 to because I know their schooling as
34:36 well but this guy was doing some feeble
34:38 job to try and make me feel like I'm
34:42 broken yeah he's like well we're all
34:45 broken or not like what none I think
34:47 we're all trying to figure [ __ ] out dude
34:48 I'm not sure okay what's what perfection
34:52 is a man's supposed to be able to
34:53 achieve that we would then compare
34:55 ourselves to that check sum and say
34:56 we're broken so when you think about
34:59 talking to God in my opinion what you're
35:02 doing is you're calling out the
35:03 dimensionality and the definitions that
35:05 you have in your mind for who God is and
35:08 who you are in relation to God because
35:10 that is why you and I would have a
35:12 conversation in real life if I met you
35:15 in real life think about it I would meet
35:16 you at a coffee shop by accident we're
35:19 standing in line there's a couple
35:20 phrases go back and forth you laugh I
35:22 laugh and they're like what are you
35:24 doing you here by yourself
35:25 yeah you want to get a center better
35:26 than we have like this random you know
35:28 meeting
35:30 this chance meeting then there's a
35:33 friend that by introduce you to you know
35:36 minor just meet you or you to me and so
35:38 now we have a qualified acquaintance
35:41 maybe we're assigned in school to sit
35:44 next to each other and that proximity
35:46 gets us together like my buddy Kyle and
35:48 I started trading stories and started
35:50 finding out that we were all into the
35:51 same thing so my question to you is who
35:57 is God and who are you and what are you
35:59 what is your true relationship between
36:00 the two of you is God omnipotent and
36:06 all-knowing such that he or she would
36:09 never be surprised thus never angry and
36:13 all the stories of God that portray God
36:16 is being angry is merely a man-made
36:18 story to explain something in their own
36:21 life you know I think one thing that
36:24 happens with God and man as something
36:29 that man does with man and I'm gonna
36:30 retell that old story they told several
36:33 years ago I go and work up this I go and
36:36 join us start up and like 1997 and I'm
36:42 in this meeting and there's some
36:45 interface thing that they want to do to
36:48 the website it's a brand new company but
36:51 they had probably about 30 40 employees
36:52 at this point and I had met the CEO of
36:56 the company his name's Peter and so I'm
37:00 in this meeting and they are suggesting
37:05 a fairly bad interface and I was
37:07 teaching interface design for two years
37:10 before I went to this place and so I'm
37:14 in there and I'm thinking well you know
37:15 so I raise my hand I wait for everyone
37:16 to get their two cents out cuz I think
37:18 maybe someone will correct this gaping
37:20 problem we have in the design and so I
37:23 finally was like okay I've been down
37:25 this road several times here's the
37:26 problem with that interface
37:28 ding-ding-ding-ding I taught interface
37:31 design for two years and I've seen a
37:33 thousand database interfaces with the
37:34 same sort of entry point and this is
37:36 going to confuse people so I saw the CTO
37:41 super nice guy Lum to death
37:43 but he tried to use the CEOs name when
37:47 he did in the conversation he goes well
37:50 I've had a conversation with Peter that
37:53 Peter wants it like this now I'm looking
37:56 at a really super high-level interface
37:59 design issue and so I'm like inside I'm
38:04 going [ __ ] that's a lie and so I
38:08 said to the room I said I don't believe
38:10 that I don't think but I don't think
38:12 Peter deals with these sorts of issues I
38:14 think you're just using his name to get
38:16 your way I'm a brand-new employee I'm
38:20 talking to one of the founders and I'm
38:21 being sort of a dick I guess but he was
38:23 [ __ ] lying in a meeting and my whole
38:26 thing was if this is the first day I can
38:29 go other places right I don't have to
38:31 work with a bunch of liars now this guy
38:33 was a super nice guy and he was just
38:35 doing a little fibs to get his way right
38:38 so I walk out of the meeting and the
38:42 dude comes up to me he goes he says well
38:45 you know about what you said he goes
38:46 sometimes it's better that we move the
38:48 ball forward no matter what and he goes
38:51 even if you're trying to get it touched
38:52 in he goes even if you move in an inch
38:54 every time you touch the ball eventually
38:55 he'll make a touchdown I'm like decent
38:59 philosophy not related to what we're
39:02 talking about but okay so in order to
39:05 scare me into submission now even you
39:08 have to understand is I've been a
39:09 founding member of major companies by
39:12 that point I had made software that had
39:14 made you know hundreds of millions of
39:16 dollars by that point in my life so even
39:18 though I'm only 27 28 years old I was
39:22 very very senior for my age in terms of
39:24 what we're talking about here and I've
39:26 always worked for the CEOs and the
39:27 founders and so for me I was at the CTOs
39:31 level before I came to this company
39:33 perhaps maybe - the title but you know
39:36 the CTOs are my best friends and we
39:38 really respect each other and prior to
39:41 this company and so in order to scare me
39:44 into submission they scheduled the next
39:46 day me having a lunch with Peter across
39:49 the street thinking I would just cower
39:53 down or something right so I go in there
39:55 and I sit down
39:57 Peter's a nicest guy and rule everyone
39:59 was super friendly and I sit down just
40:02 he and I and he goes well I heard you
40:04 had this thing yesterday and I said yeah
40:05 I said you know so-and-so tried to use
40:08 your name to say you know to get his way
40:10 with something and instead of just
40:11 saying I want to do this I got veto
40:13 power this is the way it's gonna be him
40:15 you know damn all the warnings he is
40:20 your name and I just told him I said I
40:21 can't imagine that Peter would ever do
40:23 that you know that you would ever do
40:25 that and he laughed and he goes yeah
40:28 because I don't deal with that kind of
40:30 crap he's basically saying kid you're
40:32 right you called it right sure I like
40:36 that says I like that a lot and he goes
40:40 you know obviously you now know who's in
40:44 charge and what'll happen is now you can
40:49 just let him do what he wants to do
40:50 don't challenge him if the ship sinks
40:53 it's his fault
40:54 he knows that so let's get you off onto
40:59 something else and you know what was
41:00 really cool was I created I was a
41:03 full-stack developer plus the visual
41:08 side thing so I was doing all the
41:09 photoshop and the 3d rendering plus the
41:10 back-end code and all this other stuff
41:12 and so like the guy awarded me you know
41:15 2,500 shares just for a website I made
41:17 guy CEO pulled me in later and he's like
41:19 dude this was awesome he goes people
41:21 were raving over this thing is I'm
41:23 giving you shares right now keep going
41:25 keep going so that wasn't really she
41:27 ship I had later the CEO and I shared a
41:31 girlfriend really funny like I was with
41:35 the first he was with there was like
41:36 really strange so this is what people do
41:40 to God all the time they tried to usurp
41:44 God to get their way to get you to do
41:49 what they want you to do you know how
41:52 many pedophile priests have used God as
41:56 a reason why you so you should surrender
41:58 your kid to some summer camp their kid
42:02 should be here every weekend and spend
42:04 the night or what I don't even know how
42:05 these altar boys always get touched I
42:07 don't know how it works I was a Catholic
42:10 for
42:11 very short period of time then quit that
42:12 came back because of a girlfriend and
42:14 quit but I had this creepy ass just it
42:19 was like in my hometown we had a big
42:23 Catholic Church where supposedly my
42:24 mother's father's family helped get
42:27 constructed they got married in it you
42:30 know the father's come and they lived
42:32 there forever I mean they're in that
42:33 church for like 3040 years at a time
42:35 until they croak but whoever was in
42:38 charge there had moved on somehow I
42:41 don't know if they died or whatever it
42:42 was but by 1985 we had this new guy
42:45 named as old as hell I was a
42:49 good-looking lad so obviously he wanted
42:51 in my pants and so he would I think it
42:56 was a random chance he came to the door
42:58 and then you know it's just like he's
43:01 drooling at one point and he bring me
43:04 like pictures of Christ and it was
43:07 pretty cool I kept it in my room I
43:08 didn't know what happened to it I got
43:09 left when I left my house 16 just left
43:12 it in there but he tried to befriend me
43:16 to come and spend time at the church and
43:19 I was way out of that pocket now it was
43:20 never rude to the guy but when I didn't
43:24 want to come down for a little feely
43:26 touchy how's your father
43:28 session he started getting angry at the
43:32 door on his visits and tried to freak me
43:35 out that you know guy's gonna disown me
43:39 or whatever if I don't submit sort of
43:42 thing now he didn't say I'm gonna go
43:43 touch your hole or anything but now I
43:45 know how these boys work you know he
43:49 wanted private sessions private
43:52 counseling with me right never went down
43:54 never never went down double didn't go
43:57 down right and the guy just made weird
44:00 Browns around the around the town and I
44:02 never heard a story of him harassing a
44:06 girl
44:06 except for my girlfriend who went to the
44:08 church at the time he was just super
44:11 nasty to women to girls and women they
44:16 weren't his thing they were the
44:17 abomination of the world probably the
44:19 reason why everything sucks was so again
44:24 we all develop this perception of God
44:27 regardless if we go to church or not we
44:29 have our own private sector of thinking
44:32 about who God is and it's usually based
44:35 on a relationship with God in the
44:37 causality model of I prayed for
44:39 something and either I got it or I
44:41 didn't get it
44:42 if you hold God responsible for your
44:45 life then you might say I have been
44:49 dealt wonderful cards so God is a
44:51 gracious wonderful being and I've had
44:54 personally more good cards and bad cards
44:57 in my life I don't even think I've had
44:59 any SuperDuper bad cards in my entire
45:02 life I mean I've had some shitty things
45:04 happen to me trust me but part of its my
45:07 own decision-making process for sure so
45:10 I take responsibility for a lot of the
45:12 crap I was given a choice
45:14 and at times I took pleasure over logic
45:20 you know so I guess one of my questions
45:23 to you the listener is to say look what
45:25 do you you don't have to answer in any
45:28 comment or anything but think about it
45:29 how do you perceive God how much of that
45:33 perception of God was given to you
45:35 through an organized religion how much
45:36 of it was just serendipitous you thought
45:39 of it yourself through experiences and
45:41 the more that you've actually gone to a
45:43 religious institution I think you might
45:46 have a more fascinating experience
45:48 because if you're raised in an atheist
45:49 world well you don't think about it that
45:51 much and any time you do think of the
45:55 notion of creator it's it's laughable
46:01 because God doesn't exist and about okay
46:04 I have some close family members that
46:07 don't think God exists at all but then
46:09 they don't have any real philosophical
46:14 exploration that I'm aware of but if
46:18 you're in a Catholic Church a Baptist
46:19 Church Christian Church of any kind and
46:21 you have this very formal this is who
46:24 God is read the Bible he's an angry
46:27 piece of [ __ ] that kills people left and
46:29 right and you know he's mystified by the
46:32 Garden of Eden doubt of the
46:34 how dare you break a rule when you're an
46:36 imperfect being I gave you a perfect
46:37 rule all that stuff which I just talked
46:38 about an episode at some point you don't
46:41 live in those old times right you're not
46:44 building an ark to save yourself from
46:46 some impending flood you don't have
46:51 Moses you know dividing that what is it
46:56 the Red Sea to walk across there's none
46:58 of that I always thought that was kind
47:01 of funny like there's two miracles that
47:02 need to happen and they only talk about
47:04 one miracle one miracle is Moses parting
47:07 the sea but the second miracle is drying
47:10 the soil that you would walk on to get
47:13 across could you imagine the mud you
47:15 need to step out there about ten feet
47:16 and you'd be up to your neck sinking and
47:18 you'd be dead so he dried the soil as
47:20 well which is the second miracle they
47:22 never talked about and if you're like me
47:25 then you have this weird second half to
47:29 your life where you start to smell the
47:31 BS you start to study Roman history you
47:34 start to study titus flavius the
47:36 flavia's family that most likely wrote
47:39 the Christian Bible the New Testament
47:41 you know there's 44 typology alignments
47:45 between titus flavius his life and the
47:47 story of Christ
47:48 although titus flavius lived his life
47:51 you know several years before Jesus like
47:54 50 60 years before Jesus and to honor to
47:58 honor their great Caesar who invented
48:02 the Colosseum and a bunch of other
48:04 beautiful things they created a religion
48:07 based on all previous religions to honor
48:09 their Caesar in the name of taxing you
48:12 give unto Caesar what is his you have
48:16 your 10 percent talents as you're
48:17 supposed to give the church it's all run
48:21 into the Roman Catholic Church of
48:23 Vatican City which is its own
48:25 incorporated land right and so you have
48:28 this methodology by which Rome used to
48:32 rule for another thousand years when it
48:33 should have fallen around the time of
48:35 the proverbial Christ and so you have
48:39 this duality for me personally with God
48:42 that is like I I don't let man-made
48:44 religions and the
48:46 and maid usurp ssin of God to get his
48:47 way in that previous example to
48:50 interfere with my personal perception of
48:53 God
48:54 I do get personally frustrated with God
48:57 at times the more you learn about what
49:01 these creeps have done to kids the more
49:05 it gets jaw-droppingly frustrating of
49:08 like how could you and that's why a lot
49:10 of folks was Stephen Fry the famous
49:14 British actor he mentions I can't
49:17 believe in a God because I see children
49:21 suffering and there's a there's an
49:25 interesting you know line of logic to
49:28 that because you're like if I created
49:30 the universe yeah there'd be some rules
49:32 and you just simply couldn't do these
49:35 things I would I would write your host
49:38 program from West world to not desire
49:42 these things and you know there could
49:44 still be theft there could still be
49:45 murder there could still be accidents
49:48 from hurricanes and and volcanoes
49:50 earthquakes and tornadoes right people
49:53 could die people could not learn how to
49:55 drive and hit each other and potentially
49:58 kill someone who's young so you could
50:01 leave a lot of variables in there but at
50:03 least it's an accident perhaps at its
50:06 worst out and neglect somewhere not
50:09 learning how to drive but it's not going
50:12 to be some devious thing where a father
50:14 rapes his daughters it's crazy I once
50:19 had a girlfriend that it was this weird
50:23 two-step process
50:24 where she said something I thought was
50:26 wonderful and then when I heard why that
50:29 advice that ever come down from her
50:30 mother it was horrifying and it was a
50:34 girlfriend that said you know I will
50:37 always be there for you physically I
50:39 will never deny whatever you want
50:42 physically and so you know as a guy
50:43 you're like oh my god you know I'm not a
50:45 jerk so I'm not gonna be some slave
50:47 runner but what do you mean we're gonna
50:49 have sex at any time we want to any type
50:51 of sex we want any like partial sex bah
50:53 bah bah all right
50:55 and then she I said well you know and
50:59 she said well
51:00 taught me that it's like dr. Laura just
51:04 take care of your man sex is first then
51:07 food then sleep because of the three
51:08 things guys want more than anything else
51:10 in the whole world doesn't matter if
51:12 he's an RD bloke or a lumberjack those
51:15 are the three things we want okay then
51:19 she said well I think my mom developed
51:23 that opinion because her mother did not
51:25 provide sex for her father and her
51:29 father molested my mother so her father
51:32 molested her not my girlfriend but the
51:35 the mother of the girlfriend and I was
51:36 shocked I was like oh my god I've heard
51:40 that story a hundred times I've heard
51:42 that reason being the reason why fathers
51:44 do this to their kids and it's like geez
51:47 you know there's two ways to fix that is
51:51 God
51:52 there's to make a woman as submissive
51:55 creature who sacrifices her happiness in
51:59 her life if she doesn't want to be doing
52:01 these things to satisfy the guy which is
52:03 a horrible solution or there's tempering
52:07 the chemical triggers in the man to not
52:09 desire it so much that he's going to
52:11 have to get it somewhere
52:12 mind blowing mind blowing how the real
52:16 world ends up working now again if we
52:21 reincarnate and if the suffering is
52:24 erased you don't erase it all right
52:27 because if you're trying to learn
52:29 something let's say your soul comes back
52:31 infinitely well if it comes back infidel
52:34 even matters you're gonna go through
52:36 every single beautiful thing that ever
52:39 could be done in the universe and and
52:40 every single hardship the universe can
52:42 manufacture and technically speaking you
52:45 would go through every version of both
52:47 of those hemispheres infinite amount of
52:50 times it's freaky it could be that you
52:56 know like I've said in previous episodes
52:58 I think he even said it in the
52:59 reincarnation episode a long time ago
53:01 the idea is what if you you lived a
53:08 great life you were Steven Spielberg or
53:11 I don't know Oprah Winfrey or whatever
53:13 your male/female and you're just on top
53:15 of the world constantly everything you
53:17 ever desire it's always there tons of
53:20 money you get to see every square inch
53:21 of the earth you get to experience every
53:23 type of human being drive every car live
53:26 in every house drink every champagne
53:27 whatever but you keep going back up to
53:30 this the seven places a little green
53:33 room between reincarnations where you
53:35 get to rest for a little while and get
53:36 your bearings together decide what you
53:37 want and then maybe you start
53:41 experimenting going the other way maybe
53:44 you don't want to be you know a rape
53:47 victim in your very next reincarnation
53:48 but maybe you start living like the the
53:51 middle-class life you're struggling now
53:55 to get the food on the table you're
53:56 struggling and struggling and so you
53:57 have this amazing epiphany of a of a day
54:02 you know well earned a job well done
54:05 sort of feeling and that's good you
54:07 enjoy that but you keep going up to the
54:11 green room infinities a really long time
54:13 and so you start saying well let's go to
54:16 level six seven eight nine whatever it
54:19 is 10 being the highest let's just say
54:21 yeah I scream in diabetes men the obese
54:30 child let's write this little this
54:34 little truck goes by and every kid that
54:36 runs out of their house to buy stuff off
54:37 of them is probably 20 to 30 pounds
54:41 overweight and they're like 5-1 because
54:44 they haven't grown up yet Julie said HP
54:48 helicopter
54:50 so based on your model of the universe
54:54 reason why I'm going down these word
54:55 esoteric paths and obviously some of it
54:59 being fairly negative and thought is
55:02 that this is the you know your paradigm
55:05 of thought about God is you're
55:06 controlling rules to the Monopoly game
55:09 that is praying to God talking to God in
55:13 closing I'll just tell you my personal
55:16 take on this whole thing which evolves
55:18 every day so this is my 20 19 thoughts I
55:22 talk to God like a mortal man I don't
55:26 know if I chose this world I'm living in
55:29 it certainly feels like it's for me
55:32 personally it's an orchestrated
55:34 existence it feels like I was born I had
55:38 a great time in a great place and I was
55:41 technically born in Germany but my time
55:43 is about three I lived in America I got
55:49 to live in the 70s when everything was
55:51 awesome you know BMX bikes and
55:54 motorcycles and girls and bad news bears
55:57 on the cinemas star wars you know
56:02 Indiana Jones everything was great
56:04 cartoons were raid on TV little rascals
56:07 all the water Brothers cartoons got to
56:09 live in a safe place where I'd have to
56:11 worry about perverts chasing me around
56:14 then in the 80s it was amazing right at
56:17 the end of the 80s I get to move to
56:18 California I get to have all my dreams I
56:20 get to have all my careers that I ever
56:22 wanted - a couple that I'm still working
56:24 on but I'm a very see shaded person
56:28 despite maybe one year I have a problem
56:31 earning cash another year I'm rolling in
56:33 it right and I'm very good about saving
56:36 money so that I have you know I got
56:39 money when times you know in the it
56:40 rains basically right I've had and still
56:46 have amazing friends I've dated some
56:48 amazing people my lifetime of amazing
56:50 kid so it does seem that regardless of
56:53 the chaos around me you know if you
56:55 think about the NPC model not the one
56:57 that's the famous one on the internet
56:58 but the idea that there are people in
57:00 here that are just handing out
57:02 and that's why they're pretty dry and
57:05 pretty you know shallow when you talk to
57:09 them because their only goal is to hand
57:10 out the questions like Jumanji the the
57:12 the second Jumanji to an NPC who's
57:16 passing out the quest I'll tell you this
57:18 if you haven't seen the the latest
57:21 Jumanji with Jack Black and rock and the
57:26 girl from the beautiful redhead from
57:28 Doctor Who and Kevin Hart it is a
57:33 masterful made movie the second one I
57:35 don't know if the third one's gonna be
57:36 any good one of my friends is a fairly
57:40 famous dude in Hollywood he goes why is
57:42 why is everyone trying to resurrect
57:44 Danny DeVito and Danny Glover it's like
57:47 why do I do that I happen to agree so I
57:52 feel like any hardships that I'm putting
57:54 together that I'm sorry experiencing at
57:56 this point it's I feel like I really am
57:58 in a sort of a game to get it right and
58:04 some have a friend of mine that said
58:06 life's not a game don't think of it like
58:07 that and you have to understand I'm a
58:09 video game veteran like 25 years in the
58:13 industry off and on and so I take that
58:16 statement extremely serious I don't take
58:18 it like if someone thinks their life is
58:21 a game then I understand that that can
58:23 maybe insinuate don't care about
58:24 anything just do whatever the hell you
58:27 want it doesn't matter that that well
58:29 you know what if you if you reincarnate
58:31 forever yeah it could be that that easy
58:35 it could be that one life is just hey I
58:39 just went hung out you know I was a
58:42 shitty kid from my parents I lived in
58:44 their basement eventually took a lot of
58:47 heroin and decided to come out but it
58:49 was cool I had a good time but I mean it
58:51 could be something like that
58:52 I think about all the stars that we lost
58:56 Jimi Hendrix is probably assassinated
58:59 Janis Joplin Jim Morrison all died 27
59:02 years old all big influencers to society
59:07 of the hippie movement it seemed like to
59:09 me let's go on a digression why don't me
59:12 it seemed like to me that just liked
59:15 again the Greek
59:16 theater actors and writers and producers
59:18 that were wholesale slaughtered when
59:21 they started when the government started
59:23 to realize that the plays were changing
59:24 the people's minds against the
59:26 government and they had several
59:27 revolutions based on plays that were
59:29 going on which is why the paparazzi
59:31 still exist today rights to keep keep
59:33 actors in check by social pressuring
59:36 them and embarrassing them and always
59:38 having dirt on them that's the way the
59:40 way Epstein's island worked right even
59:43 when you didn't go to the island he
59:44 would send all these girls to their
59:46 cities of choice and they'd sleep with
59:49 these young girls and of course they
59:50 record them and blackmail them and it's
59:52 just the way it worked right but those
59:54 three people Hendrix Joplin and Morrison
59:57 they were hanging on to this you know
60:01 make love not war mentality and you have
60:05 agencies that are hell-bent on war it's
60:08 how they control the world so they kill
60:12 all three of these people and then the
60:16 Manson thing happens right now Manson by
60:19 no means is an angel he's he did a lot
60:21 of weird stuff but he never killed
60:23 anyone at the Tate house you know
60:24 personally but they blame him for all
60:26 this stuff and I guess they got him
60:28 doped out so fast when he was in jail
60:30 that he never made any sense he he was
60:33 an epic example of you know insanity and
60:37 sanity like right with the tails the
60:39 heads eating the tail sort of thing he
60:41 lived in that little mezzanine he was
60:43 probably pretty mentally messed up
60:44 before he even got into that if you look
60:46 study his life he didn't live even
60:48 remotely a normal life so he's probably
60:51 guilty of generally incubating that but
60:55 the exhibition Manson to kill the hippie
60:59 movement once he was in jail and the
61:01 Tate family was murdered they it was
61:05 done no one wanted to be a hippie
61:07 everyone moved into you know your Led
61:10 Zeppelin rock-and-roll or disco and we
61:14 forgot about that whole era it's
61:16 interesting so I hope this conversation
61:18 is valuable to you what I really want
61:20 you to take away is a couple pieces of
61:22 homework for your own brain think about
61:25 how you perceive God in your life
61:28 how stereotypical is your perception of
61:30 God how real organized religion is your
61:32 perception of God and how has that
61:35 changed over time and then think about
61:39 how you prayed to God perhaps if you're
61:41 a believer in God when you were 5 15 25
61:43 35 45 etc has that evolved at all have
61:50 you calmed down from asking for winning
61:52 lottery tickets to simply saying thank
61:56 you for what you have my advice would be
62:01 this this is where I've come to I tell
62:04 friends this every once awhile it's just
62:06 this is just a loose recommendation no
62:08 judgement if you don't believe this or
62:09 don't do this but my recommendation is
62:13 ask for everything be outrageous and the
62:18 reason why is that I think again like
62:20 I've said in several episodes I think
62:22 you're here potentially to make some
62:24 incredible things happen and my only
62:28 sort of sort of way out for the evil
62:35 people of the world doing horrible
62:37 things to people is that it was their
62:42 choice to go dark was their choice to
62:45 hurt people but prior to being that kind
62:48 of person we know some people that have
62:50 been evil their whole lives and they
62:51 seem to have you know done well like
62:54 Saddam Hussein's life was pretty harsh
62:57 there's that cocaine cowboy chick from
63:00 Florida who was a badass from Cuba and
63:03 she's like killing kids at 13 and you
63:06 know I mean she she was not good the
63:08 whole way she came from a really bad
63:10 neighborhood then she sold I don't know
63:11 ten billion dollars with the cocaine in
63:13 Florida ended up getting busted she
63:16 killed her ex-husband I mean this chick
63:17 was like don't mess with her man she was
63:20 an OG if there ever was one I don't know
63:24 how to explain that but think about an
63:28 evil person getting everything they ever
63:30 wanted you know is there a devil that
63:33 sits there and rewards all these people
63:36 mathematically on paper it sure seems
63:38 like there is
63:39 and of course we assume that if they do
63:42 get rewarded that way then they're going
63:44 to some horrible place afterwards and so
63:47 they get this they get this Faust deal
63:49 where they do sign the deal with the
63:51 devil just like all those parables go
63:53 you live an amazing life up to a point
63:56 and then you always nosedive you always
63:58 pay the price in the end well I think
64:02 there's at least one prize in United
64:03 States the one to Epstein's Island over
64:05 26 times was fingered as doing some
64:08 pretty horrible things to girls and if
64:12 he dies tomorrow if he dies right when I
64:14 get done all right when I push stop on
64:16 this computer from recording the audio
64:17 he will have lived his entire life
64:19 really to his specs and his evil was
64:23 rewarded at every step of the way and
64:26 the only thing we could possibly do is
64:28 link his life to these events post death
64:32 and make sure that he is is infamous for
64:36 horrible things and not good things but
64:40 then again there's this force that
64:42 protects the image of a country and so I
64:46 think the damage has already been done
64:47 if you're part of the 17 movement you
64:49 know that these people aren't going to
64:51 get away with anything I mean I read an
64:53 RT article this morning which was they
64:57 were saying that the hill that no the
64:59 Clinton body count is one of the top
65:01 trending phrases on social media right
65:04 now I mean wow that's that's crazy right
65:07 but between you and God think about how
65:11 you do what you do if you want change in
65:13 your life
65:14 well maybe you experiment with asking
65:16 for a hell of a lot more than you
65:17 previously felt comfortable with
65:20 realizing that God doesn't have a
65:21 limited amount of resources where he is
65:24 you don't have a limited amount of
65:26 allocation to you personally perhaps
65:28 right so give that some thought I hope
65:35 you feel me on this one if you have them
65:37 into deep thoughts radio.com please go
65:39 that's where all the audio video is
65:40 social media networks ways to donate
65:42 link to the remastered season 1 just
65:46 know the websites been improved it's not
65:48 sexy or anything but you know it's
65:50 really more of a functional thing for
65:52 you guys
65:53 it's got a search field now which it
65:54 didn't have for the first four seasons
65:56 it has a category list so if you like a
66:00 particular line of conversation just
66:01 click on the category and read through
66:03 it the biggest one that's tough which
66:05 I'm going to try to add some
66:06 subcategories to is a self-improvement
66:08 side of things because there's a lot in
66:11 there there's there's over 100 and
66:13 self-improvement as I understand it in
66:17 there and take a look but until the next
66:19 episode take care of yourself in someone
66:22 else and I'll see you in the next deep
66:23 thoughts over now
