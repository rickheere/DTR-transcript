00:24 I tell you one huge problem with this
00:32 camera is that when it doesn't have
00:34 power it doesn't warn you at all that
00:37 it's about to run out of power and it
00:38 just shuts off so I just lost about 40
00:41 minutes of a show so I'm running the mic
00:43 directly to the camera this time it's
00:47 like we're gonna be out here for a
00:48 little while so obviously this show is
00:51 gonna be about believable science but I
00:54 wanted to throw out a little tribute to
00:56 the passing of Sidney Jay Mead the
01:01 incredible visual futurist who brought
01:03 us amazing visions and movies like Star
01:06 Trek the motion picture Tron Blade
01:08 Runner aliens 2010 a Space Odyssey short
01:12 circuit
01:13 Tomorrowland Elysium and the new Blade
01:16 Runner 2049 he's done tons of other
01:19 things mission Impossibles and other
01:21 movies for tons of people but he just
01:24 passed the morning of December 30th he
01:29 was 86 years old so there's a great life
01:31 he just happened to die the same age of
01:32 his father which I thought was kind of
01:34 kind of neat and ironically he passed
01:36 away in 2019 which is the year that
01:38 Blade Runner was set so for some of us
01:41 who know him very well he always said
01:44 that Blade Runner was his favorite
01:46 project he ever worked on and primarily
01:49 because he was able to control so much
01:51 it would it looked like he was a little
01:53 bummed that it you know was a negative
01:54 dark world but at the same time
01:57 it just created amazing cinematic
01:59 experience for those of us who
02:01 understand what Blade Runner is you know
02:05 all about in terms of its firsts in the
02:09 industry but the passing of Syd Mead is
02:12 gigantic because he's a one in seven
02:16 billion kind of guy that got that kind
02:19 of guy comes around no sooner than a
02:22 hundred years probably more three to
02:25 five hundred years you get a guy like
02:26 this he was a living Leonardo he was a
02:29 living
02:32 Michelangelo I mean the guy painted
02:35 photo-real when no one else did
02:38 and he painted at a level that was truly
02:41 breathtaking and people look at his
02:43 artwork today and they're just blown
02:45 away they did it with this watercolor
02:47 technology called gouache which is a lot
02:50 different than the watercolors you and I
02:52 did but I have seen photo real
02:56 watercolors that he did back when he was
02:59 in college that are real watercolors the
03:02 kind that you and I did where it was
03:04 hard to keep the stuff from running all
03:05 over the paper and this guy oh my lord
03:08 what he was capable of doing was just
03:10 tremendous but Sid was also an amazing
03:15 human being in terms of just being this
03:18 naturally charming human being he was so
03:23 incredibly brilliant that one of my
03:25 analogies for Sid is that you would go
03:27 off and read a book that's like you know
03:28 three inches thick and then you maybe
03:30 read a couple other books and then you
03:31 go over the internet reading about this
03:33 technology that you're studying and then
03:36 you go eat dinner with them or have
03:37 lunch with them and you'd mention what
03:39 you're studying and he would just blurt
03:41 out like the top end super detailed
03:45 stuff about what you're doing which
03:47 would be something you could only really
03:49 repeat if you totally understood all the
03:51 fundamentals but not below it and you're
03:54 like Sid you know I know you work all
03:55 the time how the hell did you figure
03:57 this out I don't know I saw it somewhere
03:58 something like he just was a sponge but
04:02 Sid brought us the future and you know
04:07 to give you an example when they did a
04:09 he would go to like Comic Cons for
04:11 things like Blade Runner they went in
04:14 2013 in the comic-con down at San Diego
04:17 and Sid was signing his books and he had
04:20 you know very famous people in the room
04:22 actors and stuff and the line for SIDS
04:24 all the way around the building and the
04:27 line so everyone else can be fed and you
04:28 know kept inside the building that's the
04:31 difference but people that understand
04:33 who said was but I will say the way he
04:37 checked out was phenomenal he lives in
04:42 this gorgeous gorgeous place in Pasadena
04:46 and he has one of the most incredible
04:49 partners Roger
04:51 that he's just equally amazing is said
04:53 for all different reasons and some of
04:54 the same reasons but Sid was sitting in
04:58 his unbelievable living room his whole
05:01 house is just gorgeous but his front
05:03 room is like the place we all sat and
05:06 chilled out and talked and he was
05:10 sitting there in his bed on the I me
05:12 even been on the sofa I'm not quite sure
05:14 it's big enough to be a bed but he's got
05:17 a 12 foot by 8 foot mural of his Pebble
05:19 Beach painting which is only about 18
05:23 inches tall somewhere like that but when
05:25 zoomed up 8 feet you would die if you
05:27 had to paint what was on the wall left
05:29 because the detail was so insane but he
05:33 had the fire going
05:34 he had his Christmas decorations still
05:36 up and man they do it up right there I
05:38 mean it's like I was like an enchanting
05:41 lamb when they do all their Christmas
05:43 stuff but he passed away in his living
05:46 room surrounded by all this plus a like
05:49 hundreds of these beautiful collector's
05:51 edition little model cars that they
05:53 would buy the ones I believe the
05:56 Smithsonian puts them out every once in
05:58 a while but they're very expensive
06:00 they're very gorgeous he has like eight
06:02 eight shelfs of glass something like
06:04 that and they're just all backlit
06:06 gorgeous so he collected a bunch of
06:09 beautiful furniture over the years so he
06:12 sat with his partner and his last words
06:16 were I am done here they're coming to
06:20 take me back and even his partner was
06:23 like I'm not exactly sure what the hell
06:25 that means but said always believed in
06:26 aliens we kind of think he was an
06:28 Anunnaki of some sort well yeah so he'll
06:32 be he'll be deeply missed but at the
06:34 same time he infected all of our souls
06:37 and we have now seen the future because
06:43 of Sid and you know Sid did all these
06:46 incredible designs and he always did
06:48 designs that were to be realistic you
06:51 know a gene Winfield said he built the
06:52 cars from several projects but
06:54 definitely for Blade Runner he said you
06:56 know sit doesn't design things that are
06:57 silly he designs things you could
07:00 actually build and even though we might
07:02 be missing some of the propulsion system
07:04 here and there he's still all we have to
07:08 do is figure out what those propulsion
07:09 systems are we'll have a spinner out of
07:11 Blade Runner 82 right but he worked up
07:15 until probably about a year and a half
07:18 ago when he finally just kind of got old
07:21 enough where he was like you know I
07:23 can't really hold my brush like I used
07:24 to and and that was it a hell of an
07:26 adjustment for him but he was a trooper
07:29 he was a warrior through all of his
07:32 little things that you know eventually
07:34 grew to take his life in the end but I
07:37 had the privilege of working for this
07:39 guy for 20 years and I mean literally to
07:44 the I started working for him and I
07:47 believe October October 22nd it was
07:51 October November 22nd I flew to his
07:53 house for the first time from the Bay
07:55 Area at the time I actually met him
07:56 earlier that year and had correspondence
08:00 the year before that but yeah it's
08:03 really cool so we bid big respect to sit
08:08 on this show and if you haven't seen
08:10 this said tribute it's episode 400 this
08:12 year I also did the episode on Tron 1982
08:16 so that'll be a really good homage to
08:20 Sid in terms of I guess documenting some
08:22 of his genius in the movie and just
08:25 really showing you how he thinks you
08:27 learning how he thought about design
08:29 will help you think about everything in
08:30 your life so definitely get a get in
08:33 there partake ok back to the episode I
08:35 did about 30 minutes before the camera
08:38 died actually said so the Sony camera
08:41 when it dies it it tells you it's gonna
08:43 recover the data but I don't know what
08:45 its problem is it should just be writing
08:46 to the stick constantly but it doesn't
08:48 do it right
08:49 so anyway believable science there is
08:52 this growing movement online especially
08:55 in YouTube with people figuring out the
08:59 theoretical science is all [ __ ] and
09:01 I mean that with the capital B and there
09:06 are people out there that know nothing
09:07 about science of any kind and they are
09:09 trying to chastise all of us that have
09:11 deep backgrounds in all things and we're
09:15 not convinced because we've learned the
09:17 right
09:17 way things work we know about Nikola
09:19 Tesla we know about him writing several
09:22 articles about how science was basically
09:26 falling off the deep-end by the 1930s he
09:29 was trying to warn everyone he said look
09:30 these hacks haven't created anything and
09:32 so why should you believe them I'm
09:36 creating all kinds of technology to give
09:37 away energy for free wireless technology
09:39 death rays all kinds of stuff well I
09:42 should believe me and he stood on the
09:45 shoulders of giants right who all
09:48 believe the same thing he did so
09:51 theoretical science has really two
09:54 prongs
09:55 it has deception and it has hubris those
10:00 are the two reasons why theoretical
10:03 science is funded and grows the hubris
10:08 side is what your average layman really
10:11 gets into right the person with very
10:14 little education that goes I know how
10:15 the universe was created
10:17 oh really big explosion on the deceptive
10:22 side you probably have Nikola Tesla
10:24 being a catalyst for the whole thing
10:26 because he was starting to show everyone
10:28 how everything worked you know all of
10:30 these you know Faraday ohm volt all
10:34 these guys leading up to Tesla were
10:37 really pioneering the mechanisms by
10:39 which we would control the
10:42 electromagnetic wave which is
10:44 electricity but Tesla was like okay now
10:47 now that we have all this control all
10:49 these control mechanisms in place I'm
10:51 gonna start creating inventions with
10:53 this stuff and what are our problems
10:55 okay well energy is one of our biggest
10:57 problems you know war was one of our
11:00 biggest problems communication was just
11:03 something that was going to augment
11:05 humanity but we could actually
11:06 communicate across any border and across
11:09 any continent and uni ocean and that
11:12 allows us to learn about each other and
11:14 then figure out how we can get along
11:15 with each other right and it's gonna be
11:18 interesting you know I did this once
11:20 before so I figured out exactly how I'm
11:22 gonna do this but you know where to
11:25 start your theoretical physicists that
11:27 are the most damaging are probably
11:31 like Albert Einstein the complete and
11:35 utter hack go see episode actually no
11:39 SIDS episodes 309 stains episodes 400 I
11:42 apologize but Einstein was a complete
11:46 hack complete and utter Peter Sellers
11:49 and being there the theory that he's
11:53 most known for is equals mc-squared
11:55 which was finalized one year before
11:57 Einstein was born that should give you a
11:59 nice little update on what you think
12:01 about that guy
12:03 now some people hang on to him for
12:06 racial reasons you know he's a Jewish
12:08 guy and Jewish guys are always brilliant
12:10 someone just got in trouble recently
12:11 saying that but so some people hang on
12:14 it too for that reason they take no
12:16 personal well my genetics are great it's
12:19 like man you shouldn't have to do that
12:20 you just look in the mirror man that's
12:21 where your genetics are I'm related I'm
12:25 light but I mean do I take every you
12:27 know piece of accomplishment for every
12:30 other white guy that doesn't make any
12:31 sense right but a lot of people just
12:35 hang on to it because it fuels their
12:37 grants it fuels their education it fuels
12:39 their jobs because they're tenured
12:42 professors that won't let go science
12:45 used to be this evolving thing it was
12:47 one of the most enthusiastic
12:50 mind-blowing thrilling things to be
12:52 involved in and today it it's well oh
12:55 you want to be a scientist Oh we'll come
12:56 in this room and you know get naked and
12:59 get in the coffin and start masturbating
13:00 and all this other stuff and then tell
13:02 us how you're going to carry our
13:04 theories forward and and tell us you
13:07 know we're gonna give you test questions
13:08 we're we're gonna try to shake you from
13:10 the theory and we need to know how
13:13 you're gonna always defend what we're
13:15 doing and that's what science is today
13:19 other theoretical physicists well you
13:21 probably have Neil deGrasse Tyson you
13:25 probably had Carl Sagan now some people
13:30 were just believers right you know what
13:36 happens when you believe something and
13:38 you look around and you say it and
13:40 everyone else believes the two or
13:41 they're like wow you're that super smart
13:43 person who believes
13:44 or that thing or you know about that
13:45 stuff you studied it more than me
13:47 I'm gonna give you alkaloids and
13:49 alkaloids you get to be in movies and
13:51 television shows like Neil deGrasse
13:52 Tyson
13:53 they always pump these guys up make them
13:56 celebrities so that you'll trust them as
13:58 they shove [ __ ] down your throat we have
14:03 to get back to a point where we're
14:05 willing to research things again and
14:06 there is for any for any discipline of
14:09 science especially cosmology right now
14:12 everyone's waking up to the electrical
14:14 universe next step is to wake up to the
14:17 ether o universe which supplies the
14:18 electricity to the universe get rid of
14:21 phenomenon gravity and get to ether
14:23 gravity now some things are just frauds
14:27 okay so oil being a fossil fuel is a
14:31 complete fraud propagated by the
14:34 Rockefeller family I think the year was
14:37 1894 somewhere in there they took a
14:42 sample of crude oil to this Geneva
14:45 Convention or wherever the hell it was
14:47 in Geneva and said look there's a
14:49 microscopic amount of oxygen and this
14:51 stuff so therefore it used to be alive
14:54 it's all the dead ferns and dinosaurs
14:57 from way back when
14:58 now all life on Earth stops the 16,000
15:01 feet okay that's about three miles but
15:06 we find crude oil is far down as we can
15:08 dig and the Russians have done about a
15:09 little over eight miles on one dig I
15:11 don't think that's a very common thing
15:13 because it's very expensive to do and
15:15 unnecessary but as soon as they were
15:18 able to do that the Rockefeller family
15:20 which have been selling oil from 1830s
15:23 to the 1890s they couldn't raise the
15:25 price because one is floating on the
15:27 surface of the earth because it's a
15:28 natural byproduct of the earth and so
15:31 they created artificial scarcity which
15:33 in the 21st century in the latter part
15:35 of the 20th century we had these
15:37 theories of peak oil now we do drill the
15:40 crap out of it we might drill it faster
15:42 than the earth can make it in a lot of
15:43 cases so there should be a different
15:46 word for that over drilling now we're
15:49 doing shale which has all that fracking
15:51 which is really nasty for the planet I
15:53 don't believe we should be using oil for
15:56 hardly anything
15:58 we can treat metals with oil such that
16:00 their slick for the entire duration that
16:03 the metal exists that was determined in
16:05 the air the 1950s plastics do come from
16:09 oil so there's probably a lot of real
16:11 practical uses for plastic aspirin comes
16:14 from oil but if we can come up with any
16:17 other technique to accomplish those
16:18 things we should oil comes from
16:21 compressed methane gas one carbon for
16:25 hydrogen that's methane when you crush
16:28 it with more carbon you reverse the
16:30 polarity of the count such that there
16:33 are more carbon than hydrogen hydrogen
16:35 being the explosive component and when
16:38 we refine crude oil we are boiling off
16:40 the carbon atoms that's why when you
16:42 look at diesel fuel from the 70s it
16:45 burned a big black cloud of smoke you're
16:47 seeing the carbon come off of the diesel
16:49 fuel but when you look at an f1 car go
16:52 around the the lap you don't see any
16:54 fuel coming out the pipe there's no
16:57 catalytic converter delayed converter on
16:58 that thing it is just pure burning fuel
17:02 but it's so high in the octane level
17:04 that there's very few carbon atoms for
17:07 every hydrogen atom they love charging
17:10 us five bucks for our gallon of gas in
17:12 the summertime in America although with
17:14 your Trump it's only hit four bucks a
17:16 couple times but when Tesla built his
17:20 Tesla Tower from 1917 to 1927 showed it
17:23 to JP Morgan he goes what the hell is
17:26 this thing goes it's brilliant I'm gonna
17:27 be broadcasting electricity into
17:30 everyone's houses safely and then at the
17:32 device it's gonna turn back into this
17:35 electromagnetic wave which will run the
17:36 device at the time you didn't really
17:39 think about rechargeable batteries but
17:40 imagine that your phone is always
17:42 charged everywhere you are you're in
17:43 earthquake and you're stuck underneath
17:46 some rubble and you got your phone in
17:48 your hand it'll always work as long as
17:50 they can get some transmission towers
17:51 Rhys resupply with power you can make a
17:54 phone call every two seconds would that
17:57 be nice and because the cell phone
18:01 towers wouldn't need to be wired to
18:02 anything they would work too
18:04 I mean if Tesla hadn't been stifled
18:08 there would be any problem communicating
18:10 anywhere in the planet
18:12 probably by the 1970s as opposed to the
18:15 1990s but they had to shut him down and
18:19 then they had to hatch and supply
18:22 individuals that will mislead the public
18:24 with bad theories but they had to
18:27 explain things because things are
18:29 happening right in front of us and so
18:31 they had to explain things but put the
18:33 word phenomenon in like the definition
18:36 of gravity let's take a couple a couple
18:40 little examples before we move on here
18:43 that's believable science but I'm going
18:46 to create an analogy that is completely
18:49 unbelievable so that you can see how I
18:51 see the normal theory of gravity as
18:53 dictated in every book every Wikipedia
18:56 type website it has the word phenomenon
18:59 in it which means we don't know what the
19:00 [ __ ] were talking about was what that
19:02 word defines itself as okay now what if
19:07 I said and I've used this analogy in one
19:09 episode a bunch of Jesuits discover
19:14 gravity right and they say okay this is
19:17 what it really is it's angel power
19:20 because God controls all things so if
19:24 you were just to drop this cigar it
19:26 wouldn't go anywhere but angels push it
19:28 down and you're like what you know if
19:31 you're a Christian you're totally into
19:32 it man you know totally man I already
19:34 believe a bunch of [ __ ] so totally
19:36 everyone else is wrong and I'm right so
19:38 that's your little metaphor I mean
19:39 that's your little mechanism in your
19:40 brain to believe anything in the whole
19:41 [ __ ] world right this is why I'm so
19:43 cynical about believing everything
19:46 literally like believe it metaphorically
19:49 and you'll get everything out of
19:50 religion that they want you to believe
19:52 but let's just say the Jesuits do all
19:55 the math perfectly their math say back
19:59 in the day 1500s works perfectly in 3d
20:02 software in the 21st century let's just
20:05 say like some idiocracy episode we all
20:07 still believe it's angel power because
20:10 all the math works right and the Jesuits
20:11 go see I told you angel power is this
20:14 and the math works out fine so how can
20:16 you possibly defy me and then some of us
20:20 go yeah well your math is good and we
20:23 really appreciate that contribution to
20:24 science
20:25 but we don't think it's angels
20:27 blasphemous cut his head off you know
20:30 that's what gravity is to me now for
20:34 some of you think it's just buoyancy and
20:36 it's just air pressure and you're
20:38 unaware of the experiments in high
20:40 school where they took pucks of glass
20:42 boxes vacuumed out all of the air and
20:45 all the pressure and they take a feather
20:46 and they turn it and it falls just
20:50 perfectly fine it's because ether is
20:51 going through that thing easily and
20:53 grabbing those particles and slamming
20:55 them because the earth is blocking so
20:57 much ether in the universe the ether
20:59 that's slamming into its surface is what
21:01 we know is gravity it's very weak force
21:03 but it's very important but no atoms
21:06 communicate with each other about
21:08 gravity once things get close to each
21:11 other they can start getting entangled
21:12 that's a whole separate thing but if you
21:15 had an atom on one side of the universe
21:16 and atom on the other side the universe
21:17 these theoretical scientists have
21:19 created such a crappy definition of
21:21 gravity they're telling you that they
21:22 still exchange information between each
21:24 other and would pull towards each other
21:27 okay but that's thrown out there so the
21:32 you and I never ever create an
21:34 antigravity ship with a force field with
21:38 inertial dampers that we could fly
21:40 around the world and they could shoot
21:41 rockets at us and in hit us with nukes
21:44 and it won't hurt us because we have
21:47 100% control of our ship what do they
21:51 tell you about the center of the earth
21:52 it's got nickel-iron in it right that's
21:54 what they tell you because it's magnetic
21:56 nickel iron could be magnetic and that's
21:59 why your compass points north and south
22:00 only problem is they tell you the center
22:02 of the earth does millions of degrees
22:04 due to gravity and it loses its
22:08 magnetism about 6,500 degrees I think
22:10 it's Fahrenheit
22:11 it could be Celsius but think it's
22:13 Fahrenheit so it doesn't work
22:14 immediately doesn't work and isn't it
22:18 funny that we know that we have Van
22:19 Allen belts that protect us because the
22:23 sun's coronal mass ejection is never
22:24 fried a region of the world ever right
22:27 at some point they'll be the perfect
22:28 storm for you know a CME coming off the
22:32 Sun and slamming into the Earth's
22:34 surface and burning out one whole side
22:36 of the earth never happened because we
22:38 have this protective
22:39 electromagnetic wave that ejects out of
22:42 the North Pole
22:42 spreads out perfectly in spherical
22:44 fashion slowing down as a matter of fact
22:48 and then slamming back into the bottom
22:50 of the earth all right
22:53 so where's all this electricity come
22:54 from with this nickel-iron theory
22:56 doesn't make any sense but for the same
22:59 reason that the Sun exists and has by
23:03 the way black spots on it where you can
23:05 see into its bowels it's the same book
23:08 of physics that created the earth and
23:09 the same book of physics that created
23:11 the moon we have a plasma interior it is
23:16 probably hollow because the plasma is on
23:19 the outside what's plasma
23:21 well plasma is like a lightning bolt
23:23 plasma is when you see a transformer
23:25 eject that super white you know ribbon
23:28 of electricity
23:29 it's the Jacob's Ladder and those old
23:31 sci-fi movies or it just zaps up the two
23:34 wires it's probably extremely extremely
23:39 volatile extremely powerful extremely
23:41 hot because what happens when you touch
23:43 a lightning bolt it burns a [ __ ] out of
23:45 you it's because it's moving so fast it
23:48 has to chase you and your conductive as
23:51 well so it spreads all over your body
23:52 and burned out but God forbid that we
23:55 come up with a theory of the earth
23:57 that's electrical and its nature thus
23:59 immediately explaining the Van Allen
24:01 belts we've got to have some turd in the
24:05 center of the earth I mean it's really
24:06 hilarious
24:09 so when Tesla started doing what he was
24:12 doing they realized they had a problem
24:14 on their hands this dude is inventing
24:17 things now he was way over anyone else
24:19 he's still he died in the was at the 40s
24:23 45 or something like that
24:24 25:46 he was like 80 something years old
24:27 he was still way beyond any of us of the
24:30 21st century but given enough time we
24:34 would have figured out his stuff had it
24:36 not been confiscated but before he was
24:39 dead
24:39 he's the one that wrote all the papers
24:41 saying science has lost his mind his big
24:45 contingency was the ether was the basis
24:47 of all of his machines and all of them
24:50 worked perfectly the first time
24:51 remember Mark Twain was quoted as saying
24:54 I am unable to see any wires connected
24:58 to any of the devices in his laboratory
25:00 yet they're all powered no technically
25:03 maybe he's a really good you know
25:05 organizer of wires and he managed to
25:07 keep them all out of sight to keep
25:08 everything clean he was pretty OCD but
25:11 most people said he's just using his
25:13 technology in his own laboratory to
25:15 broadcast power to his own machines in
25:19 Springfield Colorado he proved that the
25:21 Earth's core is plasma that's the big
25:24 lightning bolt picture you see in his
25:26 big Tesla coil in Springfield this is
25:28 when he was wrapped in was it 3.5
25:31 million volts of electricity and his
25:33 assistant had to reach over and turn off
25:34 the circuit and he said that time
25:37 changed
25:38 he said all time compressed into one
25:40 singularity in his mind just using nice
25:43 theoretical analogy there and it's funny
25:49 that Tesla was probably so brilliant and
25:51 so ahead of everyone else in the world
25:53 that it probably took these bankers a
25:55 little while to figure out that well
25:59 just what are we dealing with here you
26:01 know but shut him down shut him down
26:05 shut him down keep him happy in his
26:07 little flattened in New York but just
26:10 does not let his stuff spread anywhere
26:12 in fact let's take him out of the
26:14 history books which is what's happened I
26:17 never learned about this guy until I was
26:20 probably in my 20s and then that was
26:22 pretty light knowledge and then in my
26:24 30s it was like oh my god what are we
26:27 doing not teaching this guy but we're
26:29 teaching Albert Einstein stuff the hack
26:33 who stole everything stole everything he
26:37 ever came up with ever the Nobel Prize
26:40 he was on for the photoelectric effect
26:42 was nothing more than a publicity stunt
26:44 by the other two guys to make sure that
26:46 they got consideration for the Nobel
26:48 Prize because they're gonna attach this
26:50 Peter Sellers character to it
26:52 this fake that was leading everyone down
26:55 the wrong path and why is he still
26:57 worshipped to this day so you'll read
26:58 bad science and believe it that's the
27:02 truth folks guarantee this video
27:04 survives 100 years
27:05 we'll be like like how he was on it and
27:08 a lot of people were on it but the
27:11 hubris side of it's very interesting
27:12 because again we want to know the
27:15 answers to all things we are man we are
27:18 the dominant species on this planet and
27:19 we don't like unknowns we some some
27:22 people don't and some one scientists
27:25 comes out and says you know I know how
27:28 the you know universe was created and
27:32 comes up with this complete story if
27:35 it's believable then people believe it
27:38 and if you don't have any fundamental
27:40 knowledge of the principles by which
27:42 this theory is being asserted upon you
27:44 then you can't fight it and that's the
27:48 problem and they know it they know that
27:51 most people just have trade skills and
27:54 normal jobs and they're never ever going
27:56 to get to this level why would you you
27:58 would have to have a personal curiosity
28:01 and then some serious tenacity to go get
28:06 the information to probably fail trying
28:08 to get the information then you try
28:09 again you try again you start talking to
28:10 people that could get that information
28:12 to you and then you can start doing the
28:14 physics of the Big Bang and realize they
28:16 I can't they can't account for how it
28:18 occurs because they major all little
28:21 nanoseconds down to the point of the
28:23 explosion in physics this just
28:25 absolutely disintegrates
28:26 it's a ridiculous stupid theory but it's
28:30 what people believe now even in the Big
28:33 Bang Theory like I talked about and I've
28:35 had some additional conversation since
28:36 the last time I mentioned on the show so
28:38 I'm gonna give you some other
28:39 interesting funny theories that people
28:41 do to defend this they didn't have
28:44 enough mass in the universe to really
28:46 account for their explosion meaning you
28:49 have to have more stuff in that
28:50 singularity to cause the gigantic
28:52 propulsion of all this stuff and again
28:55 that's all based on the idea that sine
28:58 Stein submitted which is if something's
29:01 moving away from you the light shift is
29:03 going to be red if it's got me towards
29:04 you the light shift will be blue
29:06 immediately they found out everything's
29:08 going away from the earth thus putting
29:10 earth at the center of the universe
29:13 oopsie
29:15 but initially they said oh my god we
29:18 don't have enough mass so this we need
29:20 to come up with a sort of a frog DNA if
29:25 you're familiar with Jurassic Park or a
29:26 glue to kind of keep this whole
29:29 Cambridge University recently you know
29:33 dug up out of the archives of the 1700s
29:35 and using some old anthropology stories
29:39 of the beginning of the universe that
29:41 Joseph Campbell discovered this
29:43 ridiculous theory of the Big Bang and so
29:46 they just tuned a telescope to a certain
29:49 range of light and said we're just gonna
29:52 peer out there and they get this cloudy
29:54 picture right and they go there it is
29:56 dark matter and now dark matter is
30:00 literally the glue for every stupid
30:02 theory out there if you want to question
30:04 black opal don't write or read look it's
30:07 like shut up dude I mean seriously now
30:11 again it used to be that you would say
30:13 quite accurately well we have to think
30:15 of bad theories and inaccurate theories
30:17 before we can find the good theories and
30:19 I would totally agree the only problem
30:21 is science is not allowed to move
30:23 anymore unless you're denying biological
30:27 gender and then you can make all kinds
30:28 of changes you need to it but science
30:32 used to evolve scientists used to know
30:34 that they would be coming on to another
30:37 whole domain of science that they could
30:39 get into it was actually tangible at
30:41 physical models and actually resulted in
30:43 inventions and thus improvements to
30:45 human life it's not that way anymore
30:48 it's being policed by the internet it's
30:50 being policed by all these colleges
30:52 which are all looking at each other
30:53 winking because we throw away tens of
30:57 billions of dollars every single year
30:59 and euros towards these theoretical
31:03 scientists who are wasting everyone's
31:06 money and everyone's time they are by
31:09 definition closed-minded individuals
31:12 once you're closed-minded and we can
31:14 actually psychologically evaluate you as
31:16 being closed-minded you are no longer
31:18 qualified to be a scientist you are
31:21 literally the antithesis of what a
31:23 scientists brain should be built out of
31:25 you should be extremely right brain not
31:27 extremely left brain
31:29 at best you should be both fully
31:32 realized right like the Egyptians
31:35 considered a fully enlightened human
31:37 being to have a fully operational right
31:39 brain and left brain the men were taught
31:41 the right by the women the women were
31:43 taught the left by the men because they
31:45 realized genetically that's how whoever
31:47 designed us beautifully created us and
31:51 what's kind of sad is that you know we
31:54 know that we've had inequality at least
31:57 in treatment of women in this world and
32:00 it's usually based on some left brain
32:02 capability well you don't have
32:04 upper-body strength - shut the [ __ ] up
32:06 right Oh what does that matter
32:09 you have a stupid brain you shut the
32:11 [ __ ] up right and so this has been how
32:13 we've been managing our relationships
32:15 between the two of us the females bring
32:19 us the emotional side of course we got
32:21 plenty of soy out there to switch it all
32:23 over but we've men you know typically
32:25 we're like we got to hunt and kill
32:26 things and there's no there's no rhyme
32:28 or reason to to question how to kill
32:32 something once we figured out how a
32:33 spear can kill something the only thing
32:35 we would do is create a better weapon to
32:37 kill it faster and put ourselves at less
32:38 risk all logic logic logic I think it's
32:42 interesting that men like dogs because
32:46 it's a very ripe brain thing unless
32:48 you're a hunter or something in fact a
32:51 hunting dog does get loved like a family
32:53 member but for most part of their life
32:55 they're a left brain utility get out
32:58 there and point at the coil or a point
33:00 at something so and then I want you to
33:02 come on to call it out you're gonna
33:03 scare them out of the brush and soon as
33:05 they fly pow and we're eating dinner but
33:09 it almost seems like a woman would be
33:11 the first thing maybe a child as well
33:13 either sex would be the first part of
33:17 our genealogy that would look at a puppy
33:19 and see its beauty and go oh my gosh
33:22 maybe we should just keep this thing
33:23 around the house you know it's very
33:25 interesting how many of you have seen
33:27 that simulation of how the moon was
33:29 created by a gigantic earth killing
33:31 asteroid that hit the earth and just
33:34 turned it into dust and then from that
33:36 dust ball spun out this thing that looks
33:39 nothing like planet Earth and they want
33:42 you to believe
33:43 the moon came from the same mass that
33:46 the earth is made out of seriously we
33:48 don't have any place on earth that looks
33:50 like the moon and there's not a single
33:51 speck of what we can see on that one
33:53 side of the moon that we can see looks
33:54 anything like Earth no comparison
33:57 whatsoever but once they created that
33:59 simulation and it's it's sort of
34:01 brilliant that these people can come up
34:03 with these ideas and that's sort of it's
34:06 sort of valuable to me to see that but
34:09 then in the end at the end of the video
34:11 you go that's really neat but that's
34:14 complete [ __ ] let's not teach that
34:16 to our kids shall we if you want to
34:18 teach that to our kids
34:19 let's figure out how it really happened
34:21 and then we'll show them our bad ideas
34:24 move the kid grows up and becomes a
34:26 scientist in cosmology then they can go
34:28 ahead and take the theory down the line
34:30 walks in the room this is what we got
34:32 it's not very good it's pretty it's not
34:35 very good how do you make people believe
34:37 in black holes in this last year they
34:41 created this you know goatse ring in
34:43 space and said that they took you know
34:46 petabytes and petabytes of data coming
34:49 in from these telescope arrays and then
34:51 they created this o-ring in space and
34:54 you're like okay alright yeah sure
34:57 totally just create a picture and that's
35:00 it you've seen a black hole black holes
35:04 don't exist people but what does NASA
35:07 tell you what cosmologists tell you that
35:09 are in this thing well black holes not
35:11 only exist but they're where you can't
35:14 see them and meaning the center of the
35:16 galaxy that's a nice fun new theory and
35:19 they're also going to swallow up the
35:21 whole universe and so that creates this
35:24 you know NASA selling doom which is one
35:27 of my episodes but it makes you fund
35:29 them because they'll maybe Nestle figure
35:30 out how to get rid of a black hole not a
35:33 chance if they did exist but some people
35:36 have like a problem with the notion that
35:38 the earth is hollow and full of plasma
35:41 energy at its outer crust right they'll
35:45 say well why is the Sun on fire if it
35:47 has a plasma core and why is earth not
35:49 on fire and what's up with these gas
35:51 giants down the street well the size of
35:55 your sphere in space
35:57 controls the displacement of ether which
36:00 controls its gravity meaning how much it
36:04 displaces and incurs undisturbed pushing
36:07 and the bigger you get the more friction
36:11 you entail but the more plasma you have
36:14 and the more that it can't create a
36:16 crust anymore because it's so massive
36:18 and with the proper amount of
36:21 displacement you could get enough
36:22 gravity to create potentially fusion on
36:25 the surface of the of the Sun now again
36:29 a lot of that's theoretical as well
36:31 people will say well we know the Earth's
36:34 got you know some molten core because we
36:36 have volcanoes no you don't yes there's
36:40 volcanoes yes it's B uses all kinds of
36:42 crazy stuff methane gas being one of
36:44 them
36:45 but the reason why is that you know
36:49 first of all man has only dug down what
36:50 eight miles like I said okay so let's
36:55 say the Earth's core of a eight thousand
36:57 generally diameter ball in space
37:00 sorry flat earthers this is gonna be
37:01 heliocentric conversation but let's say
37:04 it's 50 miles both sides you know 50 and
37:08 50 so you have a hundred miles of crust
37:10 between one side and the other side the
37:13 hollow center that's probably spinning
37:16 probably not gonna change its
37:18 orientation inside you know they keep
37:20 telling you this whole thing these these
37:21 horror stories about the North Pole is
37:24 gonna shift and move over to Greenland
37:26 or it's gonna potentially shift and go
37:28 to Cairo you know and then that part of
37:29 the earth is gonna freeze and it's gonna
37:31 tip and it's gonna be all weird it's
37:32 gonna do a full 180 whatever whatever
37:36 does it wobble a little bit probably who
37:39 cares wobbling is just an organic thing
37:42 again man's hubris says well the Earth's
37:45 gotta behave the way I understand it to
37:46 behave or I wanted to behave because
37:48 I've developed all these ridiculous
37:49 fears if it were to do anything else
37:52 right again it's that multiverse single
37:55 universe thing unified universe thing
37:57 that the Higgs boson [ __ ] particle
38:01 was trying to find we'll go into that
38:04 too but so if you have this electrical
38:08 core well what's what's
38:10 plasma plasma you know again you touch
38:11 the lightning bullet burned you
38:13 okay well imagine I don't know how to
38:17 volumetrically really talk about plasma
38:19 but it's a lot on the inside okay again
38:23 Tesla proved it and Springfield Colorado
38:26 and his famous shot he was encapsulated
38:28 in 3.5 million volts his assistant had
38:32 to break the circuit like I said and he
38:34 is seeing time compressed all kinds of
38:36 wild stuff when he's inside this thing
38:38 that's an interesting conversation we'll
38:40 have to have on a different time but
38:42 that's because he put a tiny bit of
38:44 electricity down into the bowels of the
38:45 earth and he was able to pull out of the
38:47 Earth's core infinite electricity and
38:50 that cool so you have all these
38:53 materials that are down there rubbing
38:55 against the plasma and you're gonna have
38:58 molten rivers potentially miles and
39:01 miles of thick molten core it could be
39:05 extremely thin like this like the like
39:07 the membrane of a human cell which i
39:10 think is like I know 700 microns or
39:12 something he's really super thin right
39:14 so eventually there's gonna be a break
39:19 in the soil and that stuff's gonna get
39:21 pushed out and you're gonna have a
39:23 volcano it doesn't mean the insides full
39:25 of candy man you know like the blue
39:28 gumballs in the center or something but
39:31 we have to have answers for everything
39:33 if you've ever talked to a scientist
39:36 before who is more of a memorizer and
39:39 repeater you get this huge a lot my
39:42 scientist and I'm [ __ ] know everything
39:44 indebted it or not and it's like wait
39:46 are you the guy on Jeopardy that's
39:48 memorized a bunch of answers are you the
39:51 guy in Mensa who scoring 188 on your
39:53 high Q test because you can think for
39:55 yourself you can deduce you know all the
39:58 cause and effect things that are
40:00 observable in the universe and you're
40:01 able to make connections to make things
40:03 make sense again Van Allen belts pure
40:08 electricity where is it coming from an
40:10 electrical core oh wow
40:13 super duper mega genius connection we
40:16 are just made right it would also
40:19 account for the fact that everything
40:20 looks different that the moon surface
40:22 looks different
40:23 as it formed organically based on its
40:25 smaller size although way too big for
40:28 earth it's all white well you go look at
40:32 the moons of Jupiter you got like IO out
40:34 there it's almost you know well it's got
40:36 a couple in there as big as the earth
40:39 it's gonna look more like Earth a little
40:42 bit it just depends on what it bumped
40:43 into depends on what stage of its
40:46 evolution it's in but if someone tries
40:48 to tell you things like how old the
40:52 universe is give me a break trying to
40:57 tell you how old the surface of the
40:59 earth in general give me a break like
41:03 I've said the earth expands whether you
41:05 know that or not or whether you like
41:06 that or not I don't give a [ __ ] it
41:08 expands 19 centimeters a year at its
41:10 current diameter 19 centimeters almost
41:13 18 inches man or air sorry 9 inches
41:15 right almost that's massive
41:19 it's a gigantic ball in space so for it
41:21 to go 4 inches in both directions
41:24 roughly that's a lot of extra stuff and
41:29 that's going to do what its gonna push
41:32 the continents away from each other and
41:33 that's why we have oceans because the
41:36 oceans are the brand-new soil down below
41:38 that's why you have plateaus because
41:41 that's the old surface of the earth
41:43 right at the top of the plateau I don't
41:44 think anyone could possibly argue with
41:46 that right
41:47 Native Americans didn't stack rock in
41:49 South Arizona it's there because that's
41:52 the way it was people look at Devil's
41:54 Tower and they see that volcanic you
41:58 know was it tempered volcanic or in
42:02 those hexagonal shapes right now those
42:03 things are all over the world right but
42:06 you're looking up there at the top of
42:08 Devil's Tower which was in Close
42:09 Encounters of the Third Kind well it's
42:11 the old surface of the earth up there
42:12 and considering there was probably a
42:15 mountain around it at one point time
42:17 which he wrote it away as the earth
42:19 expanded and the surface broke down and
42:22 went down to our level our sea level
42:24 there you go
42:27 theoretical science is fueled by one
42:29 thing outside of the incredible
42:32 imagination of deceivers mathematics
42:36 okay well you guys have seen those big
42:40 giant formulas on boards right the
42:41 famous equals MC squared
42:43 you know Theory weekend figured out a
42:45 year before Einstein was born is based
42:47 on a bunch of stuff above the equation
42:49 it simplifies down into this energy
42:52 equals mass times the speed of light
42:53 squared okay so if any of you remember
42:59 even just basic programming or basic
43:03 formulaic expression and this works a
43:08 lot in chemistry it works a lot in
43:09 electricity electrical engineering or
43:13 again the cause and effect is in place
43:16 just like our angel power gravity the
43:19 equations work out and so these
43:20 scientists are like you're an idiot for
43:22 not believing this why am I an idiot
43:23 because it works on paper like okay you
43:26 keep taking what works I'm just gonna
43:28 figure out a different reason why this
43:30 works because none of this stuff makes
43:31 any sense the way you've defined
43:33 phenomenon gravity right but a variable
43:38 and a mathematical expression or
43:40 formulate expression as a letter and
43:43 that letter represents something in the
43:45 universe if there's a quantity it might
43:48 be multiplied times that quantity right
43:50 cigar to be a C in an equation if I had
43:54 10 cigars might be C times 10 there you
43:57 go now we're dealing with mathematical
43:59 theories of cigar existence great but
44:03 when you have these scientists that are
44:05 creating dimensions of reality it's
44:09 phenomenal you have string theory out
44:11 there
44:12 string theory which is largely dead but
44:16 it's starting to kind of make it a
44:17 comeback a little bit because people are
44:19 starting to think about electricity and
44:21 frequencies and they they like string
44:23 theory because string theory holds the
44:25 universe together so instead of that
44:28 that anomaly we talked about a long time
44:30 ago which was you know you either have a
44:35 infinite container for the universe with
44:37 a finite amount of stuff in it or you
44:39 have an infinite container with infinite
44:41 amount of stuff in it or a finite
44:43 container with finite stuff in it you
44:45 really can't have infinite stuff in a
44:47 finite container right because it would
44:50 the container there's other theories
44:53 about time and that kind of stuff now
44:56 some of this stuff again the theoretical
44:59 theoretical anything but especially
45:00 theoretical physics you may have some
45:03 people that are actually onto something
45:04 in some area of science I assure you if
45:08 their conclusions start getting
45:10 published and those conclusions starts
45:12 you argue with oil industry with the
45:14 power structure of the world economy all
45:17 that kind of stuff they're gonna come
45:19 down on that person hard they're gonna
45:21 defund them they're gonna make fun of
45:22 them and they'll roll out people like
45:24 Neil deGrasse Tyson to have a TV
45:26 appearance to [ __ ] all over you or that
45:28 person right let's take some people
45:31 though some people there might be
45:33 responsible for some of this stuff you
45:35 know they have they have put actors out
45:39 there you know Bill Nye the douchebag
45:42 guy he's got a degree in civil
45:44 engineering he was an actor on the
45:47 television show believe in Washington
45:48 state I think and they said today you
45:51 need to be the science guy and he's like
45:53 wha I don't really know and he's like
45:55 we're writing all the scripts for you
45:56 don't worry just wear this funny little
45:59 outfit and teach kids basic science yeah
46:02 okay so it's just an acting job but he
46:05 did that for enough decades the people
46:07 are now going to him for all this
46:08 regurgitation of crap the guy came out
46:13 and said that you know we're not boys
46:14 and girls anymore you know our genetics
46:18 should be overlooked and it's like no no
46:20 sorry we are what we are we're born now
46:23 if your brain thinks a different way
46:24 well that's a whole different argument
46:26 on top of what your genetics are but if
46:28 if your genetics aren't what you're born
46:30 to you know what you're born as then
46:33 there's no reason for sexual assignment
46:34 researcher surgery at all you are
46:36 exactly what you think you are well that
46:38 doesn't make any sense does it that's
46:40 why the industry makes millions and
46:43 billions of dollars off cutting people's
46:45 junk off or adding stuff to people right
46:49 again we're lost in this world so he's
46:53 pure propaganda right Bill Nye is all
46:58 propaganda and he will take a paycheck
47:00 that will [ __ ]
47:03 your kids brain you'll take a paycheck
47:06 for it that's what kind of guy he is
47:10 then you have people like Carl Sagan
47:13 everybody loves Carl I tend to think
47:16 that Carl's thing was that he was simply
47:19 one of those guys that studied well
47:22 understood what he studied and he made
47:24 television shows like Nova telling us
47:28 what things you know what he figured out
47:30 what he was told and he did such a
47:34 dapper job at it that we all bought it
47:37 and you know again it may not be a
47:39 horrible thing to learn how it doesn't
47:40 work but a lot of times when someone
47:43 tells you something wrong it's very
47:45 difficult to untell yourself then you
47:49 know I just used religion as another
47:51 logic problem here because I recently
47:53 talked to a friend of mine she was like
47:55 oh god that's right is so stupid you
48:00 know we are made whoever made us whether
48:02 it be evolution aliens or like a god
48:06 swimming in some Michelangelo painting
48:09 we're made flawed we have the
48:12 opportunity for choice it's actually a
48:15 gift and not a curse so we're gonna make
48:18 mistakes we're gonna do what Jesuits
48:21 might say is a sin but then we need to
48:26 worship God in a very special way to be
48:29 forgiven for being exactly how we're
48:31 made flawed and that is a [ __ ] up
48:34 formula if you've ever heard one before
48:36 seriously there's no need for any of
48:40 that stuff be a good person that's
48:42 probably a good idea don't try to get
48:46 stuff for free don't try to step on
48:48 people's heads
48:49 I mean free as in you should have to
48:52 normally do something to get it and
48:54 you're gonna try to scam someone out of
48:56 it there's a free sandwich somewhere and
48:59 someone's offering it just but no
49:00 strings attached go and eat that thing
49:02 that doesn't happen very often now does
49:03 it so I need to remind you in the middle
49:08 of this episode that the controlling
49:12 bodies of the world are totally hip to
49:14 everything I'm telling you they've been
49:16 running the show for a very
49:17 very long time you know they want to
49:20 treat us like mushrooms right and so I
49:22 want to keep us in the dark and finish
49:24 it constantly that's their game they
49:27 want all the knowledge and it's very
49:31 strategic they just care about
49:33 archetypes of the brain how does the
49:35 brain function because the brain is a
49:36 machine and it tends to repeat functions
49:39 that it learns how to do how many of you
49:43 have well for instance let's just use
49:45 this show as an example I had this mic
49:48 right here and I could just use one
49:50 extra wire and plug it directly into the
49:52 camera such that I don't have to track
49:54 an extra separate audio track from the
49:55 video well let's hope this works out if
49:59 it does I just shaved a bunch of editing
50:02 issues off of my bed of editing issues
50:06 because the video was always out of sync
50:08 with the computer just a little bit so
50:10 after a hour and a half episodes
50:13 probably off two to three seconds and I
50:15 have to constantly adjust that whole
50:16 thing will just be plugging this in but
50:18 I had learned what I had learned
50:20 serendipitously a bad way to do it and
50:24 so I paid a price but now today
50:27 hopefully from this point forward I
50:29 won't need a computer to do anything
50:30 other than just power the box that's it
50:33 he's an old Mac right now too part of
50:34 the box is my pcs in my lab getting
50:37 repaired religion my god if somebody
50:42 tells you me just think about someone
50:45 teaching you how to drink water in a
50:46 weird way it's not a life crushing
50:48 situation you're probably more open to
50:51 learning better ways to drink soon as
50:52 you go in public and watch other people
50:54 drink different than you you're like oh
50:55 my god I've been doing this wrong my
50:56 whole life this is stupid but if someone
50:58 tells you that your soul is gonna go to
51:01 help if you don't do this particular
51:05 combination of events which is most
51:08 normally worshiping other men on earth
51:10 in order to get your salvation other
51:13 flawed creatures hold the key to God
51:15 just to make any sense it defies all
51:18 omnipotent brain thinking so it's time
51:22 to throw it away it's time to release
51:25 ourselves from that and build a real
51:27 relationship with your Creator if you
51:28 think there is one
51:30 we're also addicted to technology that I
51:33 believe is causing us serious problems
51:36 physically and this is where we get into
51:43 believable science as it relates to our
51:45 health you are to believe that cellular
51:49 technology has nothing to do with the
51:50 extension of bees which use
51:54 electromagnetic fields to figure out
51:56 where they are which is why they leave
51:59 the nest and they go harvest a bunch of
52:00 pollen that they're gonna turn into
52:02 honey and they can't find the hive
52:04 anymore and they die vertigo is a
52:08 contagion disease right now it is like
52:11 it's not contagious between people but
52:13 it's something that you're able to
52:14 manifest at a level that I've never seen
52:17 in my lifetime I've got neighbors with
52:20 it
52:20 husband and wife two genetic distinctly
52:22 genetically different pools one's from
52:25 Mexico one's from Ireland both coming
52:27 down with vertigo all of a sudden I've
52:30 got family members of mine that have
52:31 been struggling for years with vertigo
52:33 they literally have had to figure out
52:35 how to walk around the world dizzy and
52:38 nauseated and still find a way to eat
52:42 in fact one person had a almost eating
52:44 disorder because they were so nauseous
52:46 all day long that by the time it came
52:48 down to eating food they had to kind of
52:50 hold still for a little while and then
52:53 get their appetite back so they could
52:54 eat we know that cigarettes again not
52:59 cigars right cigarettes paper with gooey
53:02 coating on it with up to 1,500 chemicals
53:05 per cigarette with a horrible filter
53:08 which shards your lung sacs were sold to
53:11 people in the nineteen or the 20th
53:13 century excuse me as a health regimen
53:16 you know hey ladies you don't want to
53:18 have a big baby you know through your
53:20 vagina well smoke cigarettes Oh get that
53:22 that the body weight down on your child
53:25 that was actual piece of advice and so
53:28 we look at all those old ads from the
53:30 jeez I don't even know when they started
53:32 I know that Will and Grace not Will and
53:35 Grace
53:35 sorry George and Gracie used her own
53:38 commercials to promote cigarette smoking
53:40 all kinds of shows now we look at it
53:44 where
53:44 oh my God look how crazy we were I'm
53:47 hoping that before this century's over
53:49 we can look at cell phone technology and
53:50 realize look how stupid we were
53:52 broadcasting all these horrible
53:54 microwave beams at our bodies promoting
53:57 insulin shock slash diabetes and human
54:00 beings because it modulates the interior
54:04 of your body these are medical facts men
54:07 I think vertigo is people putting cell
54:10 phones to their heads if you want to
54:13 think about this and this happens to me
54:15 every single time we put my cell phone
54:16 in my back pocket as long as I'm not
54:19 doing something else that's distracting
54:20 me I will feel the burning sensation on
54:24 my butt cheek of my phone and it's not
54:27 doing anything I'm not playing a big
54:28 game and just put it on pause I'm just
54:31 putting an idle phone in my back pocket
54:33 the electromagnetic wave that goes
54:37 around your telephone when it's got very
54:40 few bars is potentially as I've had it
54:43 described to me four times the size of
54:45 your telephone and now you slam that
54:48 thing against your brain your inner ear
54:50 which gives you your equilibrium poof it
54:55 might be messing with the very genetic
54:57 flow of materials inside your mind I
54:59 know that cancer saw the very cancer of
55:02 the jaw little lumps behind your ear
55:06 it's all related to cellphones but it's
55:09 a trillion dollar industry and isn't it
55:11 so you think they're gonna tell you the
55:13 truth but it's believable when they say
55:17 ah you can't see it so it doesn't exist
55:19 right this these threats you keep
55:21 talking about we wouldn't sell you
55:24 anything that would hurt you have a
55:26 cigarette mm-hmm have a Big Mac oh but
55:31 guess what the corporations that run
55:35 McDonald's they're actually more
55:37 financially stable than a pharmaceutical
55:40 company a pharmaceutical company believe
55:43 it or not is usually hanging by a thread
55:45 when it comes to their financial
55:48 solvency because they're constantly
55:51 making the kid the place I worked for
55:54 for two years they're making three drugs
55:56 at once with all kind
55:58 drugs waiting to be greenlit internally
56:00 to then find the indication to then go
56:02 file a patent and then develop through
56:04 clinical studies and then get it out the
56:06 door they have more financial pressure
56:08 to lie to you the McDonald's and what I
56:14 find hilarious is your liberal that will
56:16 tell you to take all your vaccinations
56:18 and chastise you online when they know
56:20 nothing about the science of anything
56:22 right there isn't a doctor or a nurse
56:25 that knows the ingredients of anything
56:27 they've ever injected you with ever they
56:30 may know the theoretical believable
56:32 knowledge of it but that's got aluminum
56:34 and mercury in it most the time but
56:37 these same liberals that will tell you
56:39 that the 1% is horrible that
56:41 corporations are horrible and all this
56:42 other crap about you know those people
56:44 will take a drug and put it in their
56:47 body that will genetically modify them
56:49 for the rest of their lives from that
56:52 exact corporation in fact one of the
56:54 most acutely corrupt corporation species
56:57 in the world but they believe it cancer
57:03 cancer is a man-made thing man
57:05 everybody should figure out that if we
57:07 caught cancer as much as we do today the
57:09 human species wouldn't extinct many many
57:12 years ago it's a new thing created by
57:14 bad food electromagnetic waves around us
57:17 and a bunch of other stuff stress just
57:20 as simple as stress malnutrition is huge
57:23 your immune system requires nutrients to
57:25 be at its full gain we sit on our asses
57:28 all the time nowadays so we get all
57:30 kinds of bad circulation in our blood on
57:32 our body in different places remember
57:34 all the guys getting testicular cancer
57:37 they rode bicycles it's because they're
57:39 sitting on their ABC joint and all of
57:41 the blood supply that supplies the
57:43 immune system to their testicles is
57:44 coming down the ass crack of their
57:46 button and crossing over the EBC joint
57:48 fuelling all the immune system to take
57:50 care of things when you sit on that
57:51 joint poof you cut off the immune system
57:56 and anything that's in there will go
57:59 nuts and if you're taking steroids as a
58:00 matter of fact probably getting worse so
58:04 we have all of these oxymorons that are
58:06 absolutely everywhere in medical science
58:08 in science science
58:11 and it's it's draining resources that
58:14 could be much better place than other
58:17 areas again the idea that you know I sat
58:21 in rooms with these lead chemists these
58:25 head chemists laughing about the notion
58:27 of creating a cure you know probably
58:30 once every six months the joke came up
58:31 and everybody laughed the whole hearty
58:34 laugh and then we read all the death
58:36 reports from the clinical studies mmm no
58:39 big deal
58:40 we'll get it eventually no well that's
58:43 too bad
58:44 it was never any that talked ever ever
58:46 ever now I think if we go back a couple
58:49 hundred years a human being not studying
58:53 everything was very normal and fine
58:57 because you're not being attacked by
59:00 everything you're eating organic
59:02 constantly because there's no such thing
59:04 as GMO foods you're not being irradiated
59:06 by radio television cell phone
59:09 technology so you don't have that the
59:12 workday workday at best was eight hours
59:14 and then you went home unless you're a
59:16 farmer but then farmers a better than
59:19 anyone else right
59:20 and so today many of us are becoming a
59:26 jack of many trades right and masters of
59:30 many sciences and what I love to see on
59:35 YouTube are all these videos calling
59:37 these folks out and I do hope that the
59:39 individuals that are making videos are
59:40 capable of going the extra mile and
59:43 trying to disassemble some of these
59:45 theories so that we can get to the right
59:46 ones there's been this huge push
59:49 recently because of the I think again
59:52 false association with project Looking
59:54 Glass from Q being anything related to
59:57 time travel and remote viewing now I
60:01 don't know if remote viewing you know
60:02 works but again I did a whole episode on
60:04 project Looking Glass if you're
60:06 interested please go see that episode I
60:08 break it all the way down and stomp it
60:11 like a good cigarette but you know time
60:15 travel you know again you'll have these
60:18 geniuses say things because of
60:20 theoretical science well you know Tom
60:22 isn't linear main it's all
60:23 multi-dimensional so okay great
60:25 so go to that other time dimension and
60:27 stay there would you but if you go make
60:29 a modification in a parallel universe
60:31 and come back to your own universe what
60:33 have you done to your own universe
60:34 nothing you've done nothing so the idea
60:38 of using this multi-dimensional
60:40 space-time fabric to affect your own
60:43 universe is ridiculous by your own
60:45 definition the only way you could
60:48 possibly affect this world I'm in is to
60:50 have it be linear and go back and kill
60:52 Hitler or whatever the hell you think
60:54 you need to do but we also have
60:57 something called climate change formerly
60:59 known as global warming which requires a
61:03 lot of cognitive dissidence distant
61:07 dissonance dissonance not dissidence
61:09 dissonance keep saying that wrong you
61:11 guys keep correcting me and thank you
61:13 for correcting me would you have to
61:16 basically feed your mind full of crap
61:18 you have to literally be someone who's
61:21 unable to research your own science
61:24 people who believe in this stuff are
61:26 carrying someone else's propaganda Ford
61:28 they watch it Greta right a 15 year old
61:32 kid or whatever how old she is she is
61:35 such a bundle of irony it is
61:37 unbelievable
61:38 but you know people who actually are
61:40 experts in it written 140 published
61:43 papers on it they totally disagree say
61:45 it's all [ __ ] again the co-founder
61:47 of Greenpeace knows his [ __ ]
61:49 they had meteorologists MIT this is
61:52 [ __ ] the head patent holding
61:54 scientists at NASA for climatology says
61:57 this [ __ ] okay do you need any more
62:00 you need me more than those few folks
62:03 and I forget the woman's name that was
62:05 recently posted on deep thoughts radio
62:06 page on Facebook but the authorities say
62:10 this is or I should say the true
62:13 Authority z' of this technology of
62:14 climate science says this is all crap
62:17 yeah the climate does change any
62:19 man-made and is no no worry on our back
62:22 right people have been so used to
62:24 complaining about the weather in order
62:27 to start a trite conversation with
62:29 someone else
62:30 that now they've been given a sort of a
62:32 big you know bullying club in their hand
62:38 to hit everybody
62:39 for the head if they don't believe this
62:40 crap but we need to wake up just like we
62:44 woke up to snake oil in the in the
62:46 1800's just like we woke up to
62:47 cigarettes in the 1900s
62:50 we need to wake up with all of this
62:52 technology for the 21st century
62:55 talk about bullies Greta is nothing more
62:59 than an Asperger's child who is a bully
63:03 running around with just utter half-wit
63:06 man you know if you know it would be
63:09 interesting if you had some prodigy
63:11 child who graduated college at fifteen
63:14 who specialized in climate technology
63:18 who specialized in creating new physical
63:20 models of the greenhouse gas layer index
63:24 which is 99.9% water and you know they
63:28 Pierce some thing that we can recreate
63:30 in our living room or our kitchen to
63:32 prove that some of this is real
63:34 but no they they play the demographics
63:38 right they do this all the time they
63:41 give you a leader who has got something
63:44 about them you know they'll say well
63:45 it's about time we had a female
63:47 president okay
63:48 hey don't disagree necessarily but if if
63:52 there's a man that's more suited for the
63:54 job well do you want to take down the
63:56 leadership of your country just to put a
63:58 woman in place now there's plenty of
63:59 women that can do the job trust me I'm
64:01 just saying those aren't reasons to do
64:03 things you find a person right
64:05 especially with all this you know this
64:09 gender offense that's going on in the
64:10 world it's like well you shouldn't be
64:12 saying a female or someone who isn't
64:14 white you know those things are not
64:16 allowed right because you're supposedly
64:18 this liberal mind it's the best person
64:20 for the job let him run let him talk
64:22 poof but if they don't do good during a
64:25 debate people say well you know they
64:27 didn't do good during a debate but they
64:29 would have been a great president it's
64:31 like no they wouldn't have you think the
64:33 pressure of a televised debate is any
64:35 different than talking to other world
64:37 leaders where [ __ ] matters so if you're
64:40 gonna cave on TV you're gonna cave
64:42 hardcore and a real fisticuff
64:45 negotiation to denuclearize North Korea
64:48 to establish relations with Russia
64:52 but what fuels at all theoretical
64:56 science believable science now what's
65:01 nice is we're sort of in this it's sort
65:05 of dangerous and it's sort of great we
65:07 have a bunch of folks that are starting
65:11 to believe nothing and they really you
65:14 know everyone goes through this phase
65:16 when you start to wake up you go through
65:18 this phase of like god well what's real
65:19 what history is true what science is
65:22 real what politicians are fake you know
65:27 but we have to make sure and this is
65:30 very difficult for anyone to say
65:32 especially me is it because we don't
65:35 know the answers to all of our questions
65:38 like let's say you think the world's
65:40 flat and there are reasons why people
65:42 believe that that I think are very valid
65:44 reasons and they're unable to and
65:47 believe me the controlling forces know
65:49 this they're unable to prove it's flat
65:51 other than a few you know observations
65:54 and stuff but that what they really need
65:56 is a rocket to go at least 80 miles in
65:58 the air and take a bunch of photographs
66:00 without a fisheye lens to make
66:02 everything look round and look down at
66:05 the earth and see what it looks like if
66:06 you see curvature and it's curved if
66:08 it's a flat thing well guess what
66:10 they're right but you know like I said
66:15 I'm really concerned with this archetype
66:20 maybe not specifically this particular
66:22 thing but if this does grow and it is a
66:25 round ball then boy has everybody been
66:27 duped one of the classic things that
66:31 comes out of Flat Earth believers is
66:32 that because it's flat they don't really
66:35 have a theory for how satellites work
66:37 other than Satta loons which again Satta
66:39 loons were launched late 50s early 60s
66:42 it's been a technology that exists to
66:44 this day they test things by saying them
66:47 in low atmosphere really low atmosphere
66:49 and then if that works out and that's
66:52 the test and then they go ahead launch
66:53 it really high up in the atmosphere now
66:56 the thing is is if it's flat and the Sun
67:00 and the moon are these equal sized balls
67:03 which eclipse
67:04 very amazing right random 90
67:06 three million mile away sun is perfectly
67:08 eclipsed by a elliptical orbit of the
67:11 moon doesn't make any sense people but
67:14 let's just say those things are up there
67:15 well whatever is holding them up there
67:17 it would hold up other things is what
67:19 you have to accept if you are taught the
67:23 satellites don't exist then you're
67:25 setting yourself up for a police state
67:27 of supernatural capabilities because
67:31 what will be controlling your mind from
67:33 space and I do say mind control your
67:36 brain control what emotions you're
67:38 capable of even having all that starts
67:41 to proliferate the atmosphere with
67:43 technology that you don't believe in and
67:45 then now you're suddenly a serial killer
67:48 one day and the next day you're running
67:51 a day care right so you can't get to the
67:54 point where you lose yourself in this
67:57 sort of bizarre you know chaotic world
68:00 of what do I believe it's good to have
68:04 the exercise I think in any realm of any
68:08 thinking whatsoever but at some point
68:11 you know we do have to get the hard
68:13 evidence the idea is let's say you're
68:16 flat earther and you've got a lot of
68:17 proofs in your mind that do suggest that
68:20 that's the case fine if you're lacking
68:23 the proof that that you know coup de
68:26 Gras moment then you either have to go
68:29 get that coup de Gras moment or you have
68:32 to put everything on hold with you know
68:35 your instinct and wait for someone else
68:38 to do it so you have it maybe donate to
68:40 someone's GoFundMe project that will
68:42 actually get it done again pilots all
68:46 over the world now are saying the
68:48 gyroscopes don't turn inside the
68:50 dashboard of a plane and that they
68:52 should okay I'm not a pilot I don't know
68:55 but if that's the case then that seems
68:57 like a pretty easy experiment what I've
69:00 never seen from these folks that show up
69:02 on TV pushing this theory is they're the
69:04 pilots telling us that we've got a
69:07 cellphone dude take a [ __ ] picture
69:08 would you take a picture in London of
69:11 the gyroscope then go to Cairo and take
69:14 a picture of it fly from New York to
69:16 Mexico City take a picture take a
69:17 picture that's all you need to
69:19 pictures hey you want to get really
69:21 detailed with it get a camera that can
69:23 last the entire trip and just keep it on
69:25 plug it into the whatever power you got
69:27 inside the point bear it's a continuous
69:30 shot no one can say you edit anything
69:31 you could but you know and we even have
69:34 to believe you if you cut the whole
69:35 thing in one big shot run at 4x speed or
69:38 whatever the question I have for all of
69:41 us at the end of this episode is let's
69:44 say that they spend I think Alan I think
69:47 on average we could say at least a
69:50 hundred billion dollars a year globally
69:52 on theoretical sciences right we're
69:56 gonna do a certain thing here in a
69:57 second what if we pulled that money out
70:00 because no one's believing in it we just
70:02 as a group of human beings saying yeah
70:04 sorry sorry we got we have famine in the
70:07 world we have poverty in the world we
70:10 have all kinds of problems in the world
70:12 that that money could solve for
70:14 education better health care at least
70:18 you know again health care costs
70:20 trillions and trillions of dollars
70:21 because an aspirin will cost you 15
70:23 bucks at hospital
70:24 you know I stayed a week in a hospital
70:25 in 1985 or four BBT five can't remember
70:30 an aspirin at my hometown in the middle
70:33 of nowhere was eight dollars a pop for
70:36 our Tylenol
70:37 my dad could buy a whole bottle for
70:40 eight bucks at the time could have
70:41 brought it into me that's why health
70:43 care is ridiculous we have some problems
70:47 we could solve instead of trying to
70:48 chase a bunch of doom and gloom crap
70:49 from from NASA's latest hey please keep
70:52 funding us because we've just told you
70:54 that there's a meteorite coming that
70:55 might hit your hometown right so CERN I
70:59 got a whole episode on CERN it's very
71:01 well received and has quite a few views
71:04 as a matter of fact but I break the
71:07 whole thing down the whole thing okay
71:09 with all the details but they had two
71:13 physicists in America this thing is a
71:16 euro built CERN things CERN is the
71:19 company the Hadron Collider is the
71:20 object it's an 11 mile I think wide
71:23 collider it sits between I think
71:26 Switzerland and France the largest
71:28 machine man has ever made and the whole
71:32 idea was that they would have
71:33 - well they're trying to find a bunch of
71:35 theoretical science crap which is just
71:37 like the Big Bang you know oh my god
71:40 if anyone's working there and believes
71:42 that stuff f+ for you men but they had
71:46 this theory that the universe was either
71:48 very stable or it was very unstable
71:51 multiverse is the unstable side of
71:54 things I can't recall off the top of my
71:55 head what the hell the stable universe
71:57 theory was called but the stable
72:00 universe dude came up with a frequency
72:01 that the Higgs boson particle on
72:04 complete theoretical bunch of [ __ ]
72:06 was gonna vibrate at and the multiverse
72:09 - it had his other frequency which is
72:11 obviously a lot more higher frequency
72:14 and so to appease these two dudes and
72:20 their respective groups when they found
72:24 the Higgs boson particle they put it
72:28 directly between the two frequencies and
72:30 I mean mathematically directly between
72:33 the two frequencies giving a little bit
72:36 of first I think the Higgs guy was still
72:38 alive they wanted to give him the reward
72:40 and of course the press was screwing up
72:42 CERN's hadron collider because they were
72:44 like hurry up come up with something
72:45 hurry up we spent a ton of money hurry
72:46 hurry hurry hurry not like someone just
72:48 should have said shut up
72:50 right how many times did it take to
72:52 build a light bulb before it one worked
72:54 was the theory's 10,000 okay that's a
72:56 light bulb in you want to try to find
72:59 all the answers to the universe faster
73:00 than they created the light bulb just
73:03 put a big loser L on your forehead okay
73:06 but that should have signaled to you
73:09 complete and utter [ __ ] that they
73:13 just dialed it in to literally create a
73:16 propaganda sort of PR moment in science
73:21 and to be looking for a particle that's
73:24 theory goes back to the 60s
73:26 I mean seriously it was just an
73:28 imaginary thing but had all the elements
73:31 of all things in it I mean it was just
73:33 it's so bad it's ridiculous so it's time
73:37 for us to grow up as a society we know
73:40 people who don't watch the show probably
73:42 gonna take a little bit longer but think
73:45 about it again if we were to get
73:48 our way and you know something like this
73:51 show this particular episode this
73:53 particular theory by somebody else that
73:55 doesn't swear gets really really popular
73:58 and travels the planet and just anyone
74:00 sitting in a coffee shop anyone the
74:01 world gets it and goes yeah you know
74:04 what I haven't felt that good cellphones
74:06 moved into my area I haven't felt that
74:08 good since GMO foods replaced our
74:10 organic food certainly not making enough
74:11 money growing crops let's make some
74:15 change boy that's where you know you're
74:18 at the starting gate of a labyrinth of
74:21 trying to get out of the labyrinth right
74:23 it's gonna be very very difficult you
74:26 know probably the control experiment is
74:28 to create a place in the world that has
74:30 none of this stuff everyone eats organic
74:32 there are no radio waves allowed to be
74:33 broadcast into this area perhaps you can
74:35 erect some devices that eats up the
74:37 waves made of crystals or something I
74:39 don't know and just see how healthy
74:41 people are it's interesting when they go
74:44 off to these tribes that are very
74:46 quote/unquote primitive and they find
74:49 people really old and they're like geez
74:52 without a bunch of medicine and
74:54 technology and Rockefeller owned
74:56 hospitals and Rockefeller own food
74:58 product produce production saying these
75:00 people are eat you know live in amazing
75:02 lengths of time but then modern society
75:04 moves in and everybody starts dying fast
75:06 you know they get done all the drugs
75:09 that that they used to control various
75:11 regions of the world and it's this it's
75:15 this sort of snowball running downhill
75:18 oh wow we got some cheaper food oh this
75:21 is great I can eat all the time now now
75:23 my health starts deteriorating oh great
75:27 I have all this cell phone technology
75:30 but I got vertigo all of a sudden what
75:31 the hell and my bees aren't pollinating
75:33 anything so my crops aren't growing and
75:35 they get depressed because all these
75:37 things are happening to you and then
75:38 there's the drugs take those drugs men
75:41 escape destroy your body destroy your T
75:44 cells die of something that looks just
75:46 like aids has nothing to do with AIDS
75:49 it's just just taking too many drugs so
75:53 it's a tall order man super tall order
75:56 to figure out what to do that's kind of
75:58 why I created this show which was like
75:59 look
76:00 we've already covered all the basics
76:03 never gone to the sort of 300 classes
76:05 right but someone has to think about
76:08 this stuff otherwise we don't know how
76:11 to win the game but they tell us that
76:14 we've won because we buy their products
76:17 as my old co-host from M kale to radio
76:19 used to say we ain't buying what you're
76:21 selling is probably the motto we should
76:23 take at this point in life
76:26 simplification is how the universe has
76:29 been designed you know man doesn't need
76:33 anything synthesized to exist on this
76:37 planet sure we want to create better
76:40 shelters probably create more efficient
76:42 ways of creating food but other than
76:45 that it's just basic stuff we need a
76:47 regimen of food that supplies our body
76:49 with what it needs not with what
76:50 corporations want to sell surrender the
76:52 five food groups what a bunch of crap
76:54 that was five food groups was to sell
76:57 all the industries the country made and
77:00 then when you get older you find out
77:02 you're not eating certain things anymore
77:03 you know
77:04 french fries well they're a luxury that
77:06 you don't need you know cake it's the
77:09 luxury you don't need sugar there's a
77:12 luxury you don't need creates
77:14 inflammation it's all kinds of problems
77:16 in your system diabetes obesity and you
77:19 know there's so many oxymorons with the
77:22 folks that pitch things to you you know
77:25 don't fat shame somebody but the second
77:27 someone becomes a vegan and loses 200
77:29 pounds the same people that say don't
77:30 fat Shane will put that person on a
77:32 pedestal and says look how much food
77:33 they or how much weight they lost okay
77:38 I was researching Hawaii recently my
77:43 kind of friend who lives over there and
77:44 I when I visited it was an enchanting
77:47 place and so I just got really curious
77:48 about you know what it's like to live
77:50 there and of course I found out it was I
77:53 think it the second most liberal state
77:55 in the Union now what I didn't know this
77:59 will really back to our subject in a
78:00 second year but I didn't realize was
78:02 that the Polynesians who really founded
78:05 the islands they feel very much like the
78:08 Native Americans here on the mainland
78:09 and that they feel like they're the
78:11 islands were stolen from them and it
78:12 makes complete sense and it was
78:14 one of those things that I was never
78:15 taught before and what I heard it just
78:18 recently I was like oh yeah that makes
78:20 complete sense and how sad is that you
78:22 know but think about it all right what I
78:29 found out too was that almost all of the
78:31 growth there the the fruits that they
78:34 grow for everyone else to buy it's all
78:36 GMO how sad is that
78:40 nobody wants to go to the public schools
78:42 because they're really bad okay so think
78:48 about who's running your state and think
78:51 about maybe making a change to interrupt
78:56 this insanity loop of hey these folks
78:58 say they're for me because they say
79:00 things that make me feel good about
79:01 things but they're running my state into
79:04 the ground
79:04 or selling out the land to other people
79:06 they've got our food all geo mode I mean
79:10 can you think of anything more
79:11 blasphemous than taking the food in
79:13 Hawaii and destroying its genetic makeup
79:16 I can't apparently they have islands
79:21 over there that if you're not Polynesian
79:24 you're not allowed on the island very
79:26 interesting Republican would understand
79:30 that but a liberal should say hey that's
79:33 uh that's racist but Republican goes
79:36 yeah you know what we totally see this
79:38 thing being ripped off from you we can't
79:41 change what happened to United States do
79:43 you still have some hope like we can't
79:45 you know we have to work on getting
79:47 Native Americans to procreate
79:48 it's a massive level to get them back on
79:51 on top of the United States but
79:52 Polynesians can totally control and kick
79:55 out all these [ __ ] and retake their
79:57 islands maybe you don't need to secede
80:00 from the Republic but you definitely
80:02 change things and see if something
80:04 happens you know this is the era of what
80:07 we're in and I think that's just an
80:09 archetype of a mind change that starts
80:12 to potentially advance science the way
80:15 it used to be with a lower you know case
80:17 s to get it back into the evolutionary
80:20 process anyone walking in the room with
80:23 purely mathematical concepts well it's
80:26 not like we have to shut them down but
80:27 they're gonna go on the other wing of
80:28 the college it's like okay you go over
80:29 there there's not a lot of funding for
80:31 you guys so you better love what you do
80:33 there's not gonna be you know
80:34 multi-million dollar grants for you
80:36 unless you can come up with something
80:37 super concrete that relates to anything
80:41 but just math on paper and and just just
80:45 the very last statement I'll make is it
80:46 blows me away that I'm in the year 2020
80:49 now this is a January 2nd technically
80:54 and we still have phenomenon in the
80:56 definition of gravity and everyone's
80:58 okay with that Wow you don't need to
81:03 look any further than that absolute
81:04 insanity the emperor having clothes on
81:07 insanity to realize we got a lot of work
81:09 to do and just walk up to a scientist
81:12 who's famous walk up to Neil deGrasse
81:14 Tyson ago as gravity a pole or a push
81:17 and if he says oh it's definitely a pole
81:20 then just write the guy off because
81:23 anything else he says if he has the most
81:25 fundamental definition of physics itself
81:30 with the word phenomenon its definition
81:32 he's not your guy he's not your guy
81:37 Tesla all the way back didn't have
81:39 phenomenon in the definition of gravity
81:41 they just had the word ether boom
81:44 everything defines itself your body
81:47 defines itself the Fibonacci pattern
81:49 oxy-powder it's completely and utterly
81:52 explained orbital energy explains the
81:56 core of the earth explained well that's
81:59 a good starting point in my opinion
82:02 anyway I hope you dug the episode had to
82:06 redo 40 minutes of that at least but if
82:10 you have been to deep thoughts right
82:10 home please go it's all spruced up for
82:13 2020 it has on it two sources for videos
82:19 we are getting on to bright yawn it's
82:21 gonna take a little while it seems like
82:23 a long while to get every episode up
82:24 there unless someone just blesses our
82:26 channel to have all the content I have
82:29 asked for that privilege and they have
82:30 said some boiler sent some boilerplate
82:32 email back basically says f you so
82:35 whatever they're not as cool as a vid me
82:37 used to be but [ __ ] shoot and
82:41 YouTube we're still kicking it for us
82:42 but shoot is a great alternative you
82:44 should go over there make an account
82:45 just to support them
82:46 there's plenty links for your podcast
82:48 just get to your device takes a little
82:50 bit longer to make the podcast episodes
82:52 but I just shaved a bit of the logistics
82:55 off of this microphone trick just worked
82:58 there are three social media there's a
83:01 locked Facebook group a Twitter page and
83:03 a minds comm page mine's calm again it's
83:06 better than Facebook and it's First
83:08 Amendment protected so please go over
83:10 there make an account as well the links
83:12 straight to the deep thoughts pages
83:13 there you can't get in without an
83:15 account just exactly like Facebook
83:16 there's also a few ways to donate to the
83:18 page there's PayPal for direct donations
83:20 pays for all kinds of stuff again if my
83:23 laptop can't be repaired and I hadn't
83:25 figured out this trick the show would
83:26 have ended for a few months while I
83:27 would appropriate the money to buy a new
83:30 laptop because I buy the biggest one I
83:32 can find so that I don't have to buy it
83:33 again and I don't have that kind of cash
83:36 just laying around the patreon is a cool
83:38 way you could donate a dollar a month
83:40 all the way up what you do is you get
83:42 these episodes before everyone else
83:44 about 85% of the time and you get direct
83:48 access to me unlike all the other social
83:50 media things where I have to filter
83:52 through and try to get all the comments
83:53 and YouTube we get literally tons of
83:56 comments every day on videos but if you
83:58 just get the patreon it's like you have
84:00 a chat with me personally so it's cool
84:03 for all of you who have stuck on to
84:06 patreon thank you so much some of you
84:07 came back recently I super appreciate it
84:09 it does make a difference I have two
84:11 products that I want you to use if you
84:13 need their services one everybody needs
84:15 and that's the brave browser I have made
84:17 no money from brave browser so it's not
84:19 a monetary thing but it basically is a
84:22 new browser it's not controlled by the
84:24 deep state you get it you change your
84:26 search engine from Google the duck taco
84:27 you poke their eye completely out the
84:29 browser does though it cuts off all the
84:31 trackers no one can track you if you
84:34 want to run some VPN stuff underneath
84:36 knock yourself out again the deep state
84:38 knows where you are at all times with
84:39 your IP address so don't think you're
84:41 getting away with anything in that realm
84:43 if they aren't they have a come after
84:45 you for your crime your crimes not big
84:47 enough okay that's the only thing there
84:49 but if you want to keep away you know
84:51 corporations from knowing that does work
84:52 up to a point
84:54 unless you're on their VPN service and
84:56 you don't know but you won't but the
84:58 other one if you need a backup for your
85:00 hardware in terms of your laptop or your
85:04 desktop I don't know if they do mobile
85:05 but it's about seven bucks a month seven
85:08 or eight bucks $7.99 infinite storage
85:10 for each computer and that'll get you a
85:13 year's worth of backup it is so worth it
85:16 let me tell you and it saved my bacon on
85:18 many projects including this show
85:20 there's also a store with two new
85:22 t-shirts up there that will be creating
85:24 a few more before the years out so
85:26 they're all going to be turned off as
85:29 soon as the episode ends so regardless
85:31 if I make it Pasillas over the summer
85:33 time the shirts are gone so if you want
85:35 to get just a little relic from this
85:36 particular season that's the way to do
85:38 it you will not find any season 1
85:41 episodes on this particular YouTube
85:42 channel if that's where you're going but
85:45 that's a separate channel because I
85:46 remastered them all made them all better
85:48 so there's a link for that up on the
85:49 website as well I do get a question as
85:52 to why not why excuse me the season 1
85:55 episodes aren't on the podcast and that
85:57 is not actually the case the problem is
86:01 is that the podcast software usually
86:03 limits about to about 300 entries and I
86:08 think their concern is that the RSS feed
86:10 that feeds a podcast software gets a
86:13 little too large to download so all the
86:16 audio equivalents are on the website if
86:18 you want to do that as well
86:19 so you can also download them off the
86:22 website so you can just go to season one
86:24 stuff you dig and just click the
86:26 download button on your phone it'll go
86:27 to your phone you just play the mp3 file
86:29 so again they've all been remastered
86:31 much much better so definitely get up
86:33 there and get in there and enjoy it but
86:37 until next episode take care of yourself
86:38 and someone else and I will see you in
86:40 the next deep thoughts over now
