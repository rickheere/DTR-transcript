00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:35 alright I'll do this once before someone
00:39 do it again
00:41 because I'm going to start this episode
00:44 with no clue how I'm gonna talk about
00:48 sorry I've said I got subjects on my
00:51 brain but oh the lighter is empty so was
01:06 my brain I guess I'm fluid it's all
01:12 expanded in the the lighter though so we
01:15 gotta let it calm down here
01:16 be a goddamn blowtorch here so this
01:21 cigar by the way it got crunched in my
01:23 box it got between the dividers and so I
01:26 don't you can see this this might be
01:29 like burgess Meredith smoking a double
01:32 cigar Twilight Zone we'll see what
01:35 happens here what would be the best
01:37 cigars ever had in my life makes it
01:44 better no slamming cigar phase envelops
01:50 the world mm-hmm y'all that been tobacco
02:03 well it's a definite testimony to the
02:07 Herrera silly crash tests has it's had a
02:12 side impact and it's still smoking great
02:15 and there's no chimney effects coming
02:18 out of the side of the cigar so hey
02:21 maybe this episode's looking up already
02:23 so I'm thinking about things like quanta
02:28 things are starting to Welsh Jesus not
02:30 even starting the things has been
02:32 pissing me off is the obsolescence in
02:39 technical devices especially made by the
02:41 company known as Apple the shenanigans
02:44 that they play that are I guess
02:46 technically
02:47 to do it makes all your devices suck
02:50 right lying about how they only slow
02:54 down your phone's due to battery issues
02:57 but help my desktop slowed down too you
03:02 might have a teeny tiny battery to hang
03:03 on to the time when cycled off but other
03:07 net what they're doing is they're
03:11 recompiling the operating system so it's
03:13 incompatible with the the pins inside
03:16 your CPU so as long as the upgrade your
03:19 CPU they're [ __ ] you and the only
03:21 compiled for the native CPU that's the
03:23 latest one out the door and so your
03:26 computer has to do sort of a forwarding
03:28 address to say hey where's the pin and
03:32 they're like oh no no you're coming in
03:34 with a modern pin mapping we got the old
03:36 pin mapping here use this interpretive
03:39 layer of software to find the right
03:43 place and that delay of figuring out
03:46 that they're in the wrong place and then
03:47 redirecting them that's where we're
03:49 getting the slowdown it's legal but it's
03:55 sort of like what would what would
03:57 happen to Mercedes Benz if they release
04:00 cars and you know next year just started
04:05 going ten miles an hour slower and the
04:07 year after that it goes twenty miles an
04:09 hour slower from that from the point you
04:11 you purchased it I think you could sue
04:14 the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of them and it
04:15 doesn't matter if you sign a little
04:17 contract saying I totally understand all
04:19 these legal leaves because I have a
04:20 [ __ ] law degree from Harvard iTunes
04:24 right at some point we have to have laws
04:28 on the books that say you do not have
04:31 the vocational ability to protect
04:34 yourself in the legalese and so
04:35 therefore you can enter into these types
04:38 of agreements until you get counseling
04:40 to make sure you do understand but let's
04:43 put the burden on the corporation or the
04:45 douchebag writing the legalese you know
04:47 you're gonna have to lawfully and
04:50 legally describe to your potential
04:52 client or customer what the hell you're
04:55 talking about
04:56 you imagine that if part of the
05:00 part of the law was that you had to not
05:05 only write it in legalese but you had to
05:08 translate it in another language that's
05:12 like normal language by some disciplines
05:15 as well okay so we just dove into a
05:18 little bit of Legally stuff is it legal
05:21 to put obsolescence into products and
05:25 we're not talking about building it out
05:26 of cheap materials and the materials
05:28 fall apart you know you have batteries
05:33 and computers that swell up and explode
05:36 it's a little bit better these days but
05:39 my first was say I was gonna say my
05:41 second Apple laptop you know it's
05:45 working heavily with people at Apple at
05:48 the tippy-top and hey I finally it all
05:51 happen within like a week when one of my
05:53 batteries started to swell and so I took
05:57 it out I got another battery and then I
05:59 put it in the put in the closet and then
06:03 it like it must have swollen like 100
06:06 sorry one inch over its normal diameter
06:09 and part of its like you know half an
06:11 inch below and half an inch above and so
06:15 I took a picture of it and I sent it
06:16 directly into headquarters and I said
06:18 hey what is what's up with this and the
06:20 reply came back yeah they do that no
06:24 okay it's not exactly on the brochure is
06:26 it starting to come into focus here not
06:30 exactly sure what to call this but let's
06:33 be under around a little bit about sort
06:38 of the society looking the other way
06:41 when people get screwed right let's go
06:47 through some examples because you know
06:50 my assertion is going to be that this
06:54 shouldn't be possible all right what is
06:58 the fifth amendment fifth minute fifth
07:00 amendment is that you cannot be forced
07:04 and a court of law to incriminate
07:06 yourself that's kind of a paraphrase of
07:09 it right but now if your little Richard
07:14 you Chuck Berry and a ton of other folks
07:18 and you sign a record deal and you
07:23 produce some amazing music you set the
07:26 tone for what rock and roll is going to
07:28 be and the public then finds out you
07:32 signed such a bad record deal that they
07:34 got all the rights to your music and
07:37 you've got some money when they sign a
07:41 record deal that says you know you get X
07:44 amount of dollars for this and that but
07:46 we get to take out all of our expenses
07:47 first out of your money and you get
07:50 what's left that's a fuk deal Mike Tyson
07:53 got those deals from Don King right I
07:57 mean didn't he have like a purse that
08:00 was like 150 million dollars and I think
08:04 the guy got I don't know three so I'm
08:08 really horrible number maybe thirty or
08:09 something he's had so many bad moments
08:12 like that it's hard to keep track but
08:16 now here's society watching this occur
08:18 and what do we do we currently because
08:23 there's a lot of money to be made on all
08:25 sides of the fence here the attorneys
08:28 get to massage up all of the
08:30 disagreements on both sides I mean do
08:32 you realize that if you're in a divorce
08:36 you're trying to get to a divorce
08:38 settlement you have to divorce attorneys
08:39 your wife's got one you have one that
08:44 these attorneys in almost every single
08:46 case will contact each other behind the
08:50 scenes lay out a full strategy for
08:55 keeping both the husband and the wife
08:58 going for as long as their budget will
09:01 allow milking out every dime she doesn't
09:06 say anything he doesn't say anything
09:07 really
09:08 the attorneys get it all so society
09:11 knows like we all knew back in the 70s
09:15 and 80s that Chuck Berry and Little
09:17 Richard got completely screwed out of
09:19 their rights to own their own music and
09:21 I think Michael Jackson bought Little
09:23 Richard's music and gave it back to him
09:26 but now why did it take Michael Jackson
09:28 to come in and buy that and give it back
09:30 to it
09:31 why didn't secede he come in and say
09:32 wait wait wait let's see this contract
09:34 here yeah yeah mister you know [ __ ]
09:38 record contract [ __ ]
09:40 we know he signed it but this is this is
09:45 harm right you're supposed to live by
09:48 common law this is harm you are stealing
09:52 this man's property did you write the
09:55 lyrics
09:55 you know mr. squirmy wormy white guy no
09:58 hmm did you writing the melodies no did
10:01 you ever get on stage and perform with
10:02 him no okay okay we're not saying you
10:06 shouldn't make money off this we're just
10:07 saying that's all you should get is a
10:10 flat fee for what you contributed a
10:12 proportion of the profits but in the end
10:14 this gentleman owns his own [ __ ] so it
10:19 seems to be this sort of weird mezzanine
10:23 of being good and being bad where these
10:26 contracts get crafted and people get had
10:29 and then you can't believe it and then
10:33 what happens you go to court and they
10:36 just look at the contract and say did
10:38 you sign this yes did you understand
10:42 what you were signing not really I
10:44 thought I did
10:45 it was misrepresented to me or whatever
10:46 but in the end usually the judge just
10:49 says well there's nothing illegal about
10:51 it so you have to you know suck it up
10:54 Arthur riots going on right now for like
10:57 the fifth week in France they're
10:59 bullshitting Americans that it's about a
11:01 gas tax when a giant group of them are
11:07 wearing Q and on shirts they're wearing
11:09 pyramid shirts pyramid these vests scuse
11:12 me the yellow vests they're wearing
11:14 these yellow vests with Q on them with
11:16 these Illuminati pyramid caps with
11:19 scissors jammed in their eyes
11:21 I'd say France has had enough of this
11:23 [ __ ] if what I understand it's
11:25 spreading all over Europe and it seems
11:29 healthy because it's not a civil war
11:32 it's the people saying bring out the
11:36 guillotines
11:38 let's sharpen those babies up let's put
11:41 some oil on those things cuz we're gonna
11:43 line all you [ __ ] aristocratic
11:46 [ __ ] up we're gonna cut your head
11:48 off one way or the other
11:51 symbolically or physically it seems like
11:55 that's what they're saying
11:57 it's a much-needed step in my opinion
12:01 because again this I don't know I mean I
12:05 love the word [ __ ] I love it it's
12:07 like it's a conniving bunch of [ __ ]
12:10 that happens constantly right and
12:13 because we're all [ __ ] serves we're
12:15 all brushing our teeth with goddamn
12:17 fluoride we just can't wait to get
12:20 enough of it right your banks screw you
12:25 with fees right try to get a [ __ ] you
12:28 know I don't know sorry about swearing
12:30 just it's a seasonal thing banks charge
12:36 all kinds of money to take money out of
12:37 an ATM they charge you money pretending
12:41 like computer transfers actually cost
12:43 them anything
12:44 you know gasoline prices just to stop on
12:47 that for one second it's all
12:49 artificially inflated the stuffs not a
12:51 fossil fuel sorry to burst your bubble
12:53 and so all they do is they stop pumping
12:56 it to create scarcity but scarcity is
12:59 all [ __ ] because you know the funny
13:01 thing is Saudi Arabia barely supplies
13:07 oil to America if anything Mexico is
13:11 like twenty five thirty percent of our
13:12 oil from down south so you never hear
13:18 any complaints about what they're doing
13:20 down there they just pump it we buy it
13:22 and it's great we have a good
13:23 relationship right now we've opened up a
13:26 bunch of our own wells which we knew we
13:27 always had and now we've become ice Fred
13:31 to different locations for both
13:33 conservative and liberal locations most
13:36 fake paradigms that we're now selling
13:39 more oil than anyone we're exporting it
13:42 alright I just filled up my tank the
13:45 other day for the cheapest I've had gas
13:48 and I don't know
13:50 ten years it's crazy it's beautiful
13:54 right but what's the old mantra of this
13:57 show are you building society from the
14:01 bottom up and the the descriptor that
14:06 goes with that is to simply say again we
14:08 never thought that Q and I would ever be
14:09 around or Trump would ever be President
14:12 or France would ever be saying screw you
14:16 in French but the idea is if we ever got
14:19 control of the planet we have to figure
14:21 out a way before we get control of the
14:23 planet how are we gonna run this place
14:26 what are the standards you know France
14:30 has the upper hand the citizens of
14:31 France and the Yellowjackets had the
14:34 upper hand right now they've got macron
14:37 hiding he's [ __ ] AWOL right now right
14:39 he's letting the Foreign Minister a
14:41 prime minister or whatever it is foreign
14:43 minister take care of all this stuff Wow
14:47 a hero is defined by his actions under
14:52 pressure
14:53 McCarron just ran and hid
14:55 isn't that awesome right he showed his
14:58 true colors okay but what France has to
15:02 remember is the coup in Russia what's
15:07 that all about well I've covered it a
15:10 couple of times in different episodes
15:12 but the people were told by their
15:16 controllers that they had one right got
15:19 rid of that bad Gorbachev got rid of the
15:21 USSR right here's Yeltsin complete
15:25 [ __ ] drunk
15:26 unlike Putin Yeltsin you know was just a
15:32 hand shaker Putin was a badass Putin has
15:36 a [ __ ] huge IQ Putin is physically
15:38 very formidable
15:40 but he's also just mature as hell
15:42 perfect diplomat amazing guy now you may
15:45 want me to be dead [ __ ] I don't know
15:46 right I doubt it but Yeltsin was a drunk
15:51 too signed a bunch of loans with the IMF
15:53 within one year it all went tits up and
15:55 he owed three times as much the old game
15:58 that they played on South America to
15:59 take the place over but the reason why
16:02 he became president was
16:04 on the back of a car with a megaphone in
16:06 a crowd and started saying we won we won
16:08 we won
16:09 and of course everybody wanted to hear
16:10 that so we would have done it - they bid
16:15 it hook line and sinker and they said
16:18 you're the guy in charge he's the guy
16:20 that said we won and he's got diplomatic
16:22 connections and World Bank connections
16:24 he did not for their benefit of course
16:28 Putin has been repairing Yeltsin's
16:30 damage to the country for last 20 years
16:33 so again France is in the streets I
16:38 think they're making a really good point
16:40 I don't believe at all it's about
16:43 exclusively about the gas tax I'm sure
16:45 it's on the line a list of items that
16:48 they're pissed off about it's being spun
16:53 by the world press I was at a super
16:56 press has nothing but a gas tax but it's
17:00 not but how could we create a system by
17:04 which we could protect normal citizens
17:08 from predators it sounds like a slippery
17:10 slope doesn't it in the state of
17:13 California you have limitations by which
17:15 you can charge interest on a late
17:17 invoice as a corporation but the state
17:20 can can break that rule like a
17:26 hundredfold right you could have a five
17:30 dollar penalty that turns into a 100
17:32 dollar penalty but if you had a five
17:35 dollar invoice with your neighbor or a
17:37 customer and they miss one payment
17:39 they're 30 days late 45 days late 60
17:42 days late you cannot give them a bill
17:44 for $1,000 it's not allowed now a lot of
17:50 times you know I would say this much to
17:53 say to me as a corporation that I can't
17:55 come up with outrageous penalties I
17:57 think it's great now penalties are
18:00 designed to inspire the customer who
18:03 owes money to pay you because you you
18:07 have this you get the access to the the
18:10 satanist accessory right
18:13 this compound interesting where you get
18:15 to charge and charge and charge and the
18:17 penalties then exceed
18:18 the principle debt that you actually had
18:21 but to put mechanisms in place to make
18:25 sure that I don't go nuts with this
18:27 mechanism it's really labeled as a
18:29 regulation there's regulatory committees
18:32 that keep you from doing those kind of
18:34 things right they determine that sort of
18:37 thing
18:38 well regulations can get dangerous right
18:42 you can kill entire industries with one
18:45 regulation every kid in America drinks
18:48 before 21 they do if they want to right
18:52 every kid smokes before they're 21 if
18:55 they want to you make it illegal but you
19:00 know you know the police officers could
19:02 find kids smoking constantly and bust
19:04 them constantly if they really wanted to
19:06 but there's not enough money in it so we
19:08 make it symbolically illegal but we
19:10 don't enforce it in California there's a
19:14 ordinance in most cities that you can't
19:16 smoke within I think 20 feet of a door
19:19 or a window of a professional
19:22 brick-and-mortar retail well I had a
19:27 software company on the second floor of
19:29 this area and it was a picnic area tons
19:33 of doors down below us into these
19:35 outlets that you know people rented and
19:39 we had all these smokers that would come
19:41 and huddle straight below the window in
19:43 the summertime we didn't need to run our
19:47 air-conditioner as long as we keep the
19:49 windows open but if we kept the windows
19:51 open we had all the smokers downstairs
19:52 filling up our entire place with smoke
19:55 and even if we did close the doors or
19:57 close the windows and turn the
19:58 air-conditioning on it went over the
19:59 roof into the system right into our
20:01 office
20:02 I had a recovering cancer patient as a
20:06 employee she was a full remission of
20:09 course but it just wasn't good
20:12 eventually I had a pregnant employee so
20:15 I petitioned to the property manager and
20:20 they moved the ashtrays the physical a
20:22 straights further away because I told
20:25 him I said you can't put ashtrays where
20:26 they're illegal to use right so they
20:29 obliged very curiously
20:31 and then I called the cops and I said
20:36 what's the deal with this thing I said I
20:38 if you guys could just pay a little
20:39 visit down here just yeah I want people
20:42 arrested or anything but just remind
20:44 people that there is you know some
20:46 ordinance down here and they said you
20:49 know it does exist but we don't enforce
20:51 it and I understand you know if they're
20:54 chasing real crimes and doing real
20:57 things it was very interesting
21:01 California has passed props preventing
21:04 illegal immigrants from taking advantage
21:06 of certain public services this is
21:08 probably bad twenty years ago so we
21:11 passed it as the citizens of the state
21:13 but the state comes in and says we're
21:16 not going to allow this Prop to exist
21:20 what you know we voted on it but we
21:23 can't have what we vote for hmm and why
21:27 do soldiers die again I don't know
21:29 enough about case law and the examples
21:34 of case studies related to what I'm
21:35 talking about to really give you super
21:38 hardcore examples but I think without
21:40 and being an attorney each and every one
21:42 of us can recall at least a relative a
21:46 friend or maybe even our personal
21:48 experience about contracts that may have
21:51 been signed that were as close to
21:57 [ __ ] as we can possibly define how do
22:02 we get a handle on that how do we get a
22:05 handle on companies like Apple that
22:09 without your knowledge they're slowing
22:12 down all of your devices and why do they
22:14 do it because they want you to buy a new
22:16 device we give you a little quiz in the
22:19 computer around just so that you can
22:21 understand one you know you could run a
22:27 Microsoft Windows computer for a long
22:29 time and it's going to continue at the
22:31 speed at which you bought it when you
22:34 first got it now software requires more
22:37 and more processor power as time moves
22:40 on you know video games get more intense
22:42 you know just more calculations than any
22:44 one piece of editing soft or whatever
22:46 whatever but the reason why is that
22:50 Microsoft only makes the operating
22:52 system they don't make the computer now
22:53 they do make computers now but they're
22:55 not gonna play any games right because
22:59 they'd have to play games with all the
23:00 different processors screwing them all
23:02 up and they're not going to do that
23:04 they've got into a processor to take
23:07 care of AMD processors Nvidia processors
23:10 other processors but Apple controls
23:13 everything right they control the
23:15 complete ecosystem of their computers
23:17 and their devices they pick the hardware
23:21 they write the software and they put it
23:24 all together that gives them an
23:27 advantage to injure their own ecosystem
23:30 now what's interesting is Steve Jobs
23:32 used to always say you know we're the
23:34 Sony were the Mercedes and Microsoft is
23:38 the Toyota or something like that right
23:41 I will never agree that that's a good
23:45 idea I will agree that that was
23:47 definitely the case you know they were
23:49 like the Trinitron best TV in the planet
23:52 back in the day but the most expensive
23:56 as well so they sold very few units
23:58 compared to the rest of the units in the
24:00 world and so Sony is currently on
24:03 life-support right this very second they
24:06 get a pretty good tunnel going on this
24:08 cigar here do that.you cigar smokers you
24:12 go hole in there see where that goes but
24:17 then the corporation gets to lie the
24:20 people have known as the tech people
24:22 have known this for a very long time and
24:24 the real telltale sign is this if
24:28 someone told you that the processor is a
24:29 64-bit processor and it runs at 3
24:33 gigahertz all right that means 64 units
24:37 of information slash instructions can be
24:39 fed into the chip at any one point in
24:43 time data streams whatever you need and
24:46 then based on the amount of transistors
24:52 inside and the overall architecture of
24:54 the chip it's going to run to three
24:55 gigahertz
24:56 when you bring it home you were
24:58 completely satisfied with the speed of
24:59 the computer or the telephone or the
25:02 tablet or your watch or whatever but
25:07 then and in the last five years
25:09 especially we're only barely getting to
25:12 four gigahertz right now there was a big
25:14 article that someone had breached five
25:16 gigahertz but again it's not for sale
25:18 they're just saying in a laboratory and
25:20 we got to find gigahertz
25:21 okay well the three gigahertz five year
25:27 old model being slower than today's
25:29 three gigahertz modern-day model as
25:31 about as it makes about as much sense as
25:35 you buying a Corvette with 600
25:39 horsepower you wait five years and you
25:42 buy another car a Corvette same cylinder
25:44 count saying you know piston diameter or
25:49 whatever there's no extra fuel injection
25:52 on it there's no extra turbos on it
25:54 whatever you got on your five year model
25:56 it's in this this recent model but it's
25:59 600 mega or 600 excuse me horsepower but
26:02 now it can pass that car like it's a
26:06 like a red wagon like it's been pulled
26:09 by human being wouldn't that seem a
26:12 little strange right in the automotive
26:16 business if you have the same
26:20 engineering company recreating engine
26:22 after engine I mean you realize that f1
26:25 cars were faster in the past on they are
26:27 today because it's just reality of
26:32 horsepower of how big the combustion
26:37 chambers are the pipe designs the fuel
26:39 designs they weren't hybrids same thing
26:45 goes for a computer now for those of you
26:49 who are old enough this is this should
26:51 make you go hmm okay for those of you
26:54 aren't old enough
26:55 this should blow your mind and I think
27:00 I've mentioned this won't happen so a
27:01 long time ago so if you remember this
27:04 you've seen them all baby back in 1980
27:09 personal computers were brand-new okay
27:12 Apple had been making their Apple line 1
27:15 and 2 for about four years the PC I
27:18 believe the windows are starting Windows
27:20 the IBM PC was released in 81 I think I
27:24 don't think it was an 80 but there was
27:26 the Texas Instruments there was a TSR 80
27:28 line tons of computers everyone was
27:33 trying to figure out who was gonna win
27:34 this battle right and the battle raged
27:36 until pretty much the late 80s but I
27:40 watched receptionist's very specifically
27:44 who were amazing
27:46 who typed a hundred and twenty words per
27:49 minute just a fact the one I remember is
27:54 on an Apple 2 computer this woman was
27:56 typing 120 words per minute and they
28:00 were doing the old-fashioned thing she
28:02 was typing and then would stop and count
28:04 and subtract for you no mistakes which I
28:06 don't think there were any but this
28:08 computer I don't think had one mega hurt
28:10 if it did it had one mega hurt right but
28:16 it could handle it it could handle it if
28:19 she needed to correct her typing it
28:21 would just be instantaneous and yeah it
28:24 was a DOS type interface right so you're
28:26 looking at sort of a you know black
28:28 screen with or with the letters on it
28:30 but so what you mean to tell me that by
28:34 putting the words inside of a graphical
28:37 user interface with fonts and shadows
28:39 perhaps or whatever you mean to tell me
28:42 that I should be waiting for a character
28:45 wrapped to happen on a telephone that's
28:47 over a million times faster than her
28:49 computer if not four million times
28:51 faster than her computer hmm I don't buy
28:55 it they tell you that they Apple tells
28:59 you that they slow down your phone
29:00 because the battery might do it my
29:02 battery did which is explode you know
29:03 just get bigger and bigger okay but now
29:08 what did Apple slash Steve Jobs prove to
29:11 the world on stage several times when
29:17 battery-operated devices first came out
29:19 like laptops and
29:21 the first cellphones they used to when
29:27 you put the power in it would power the
29:29 battery but they still wired the circuit
29:31 directly to the battery supply so no
29:33 matter what you were doing on your
29:34 device that used the battery and then
29:38 they got the smart idea if it's plugged
29:40 in let's go ahead and route a direct
29:44 wiring directly to the circuit go ahead
29:47 and charge the battery but once it's
29:48 full we'll just leave it alone but for
29:51 the entire time your device is plugged
29:52 in the battery is being bypassed so
29:56 there's a notion that you have had your
29:59 your digital device slow down because
30:01 there's a battery in it should not be
30:03 true if the device is plugged in now I
30:08 run android right on my telephone I will
30:11 tell you any one of you Apple people
30:12 that are still running an iPhone one
30:15 you're dealing with a glass screen which
30:19 obviously breaks almost every single
30:21 time I do have one friend with an
30:23 Android with a broken screen but I've
30:26 heard that androids use plastic for
30:29 their at least the Samsung's which is
30:30 what he has I run the note 8 which I
30:35 love man let me tell you this phone is
30:39 like is so much more advanced than the
30:43 latest iPhones that come that has come
30:45 out recently which is the new was it the
30:48 XL XR all these different you know $1500
30:51 phones my friend my phone runs laps
30:54 around that my camera is so much better
30:56 than their camera I'm not noticing the
31:00 total slowdown I'm probably only plugged
31:04 in at night in the morning when I'm in
31:07 bed you know just checking out the news
31:09 or whatever but what if there was just a
31:11 simple regulation for the United States
31:14 of America retro actively effective that
31:19 said you cannot hurt your customers
31:22 intentionally and if you are going to do
31:27 any type of corporate strategy by which
31:30 you are going to make the decision
31:32 advance your technology you're gonna
31:35 have to support the old phone and its
31:38 native processor integrity meaning when
31:41 you compile the operating system and you
31:43 compile the applications you're going to
31:46 have to make sure that they are
31:48 compatible with the operating with the
31:50 chip that's in there so they don't have
31:51 to read
31:52 Ord you know pin counts and very
31:56 specific access points in the in the
31:58 microchip now in the automotive business
32:01 what happens you know that when you buy
32:04 a car the automotive business is
32:08 obligated for a certain number of years
32:10 I cannot remember the amount of years it
32:12 might vary but they have to keep parts
32:16 available for your car quarter panels
32:20 hoods steering wheels brake pads
32:22 everything they have to be able to prove
32:25 to the United States of America that
32:27 they are capable of servicing your car
32:31 well that sounds pretty cool right I
32:34 have never heard of my life a car being
32:37 taken in for a repair and then all of a
32:40 sudden it goes 40 miles an hour slower
32:42 but that's happening with all digital
32:45 devices isn't it I know you guys feel me
32:49 but I want to kind of drive that home
32:50 give you some examples now we know that
32:54 there are Ponzi schemes out there where
32:57 people are lured into investments with
32:59 false pretenses meaning the business is
33:02 not operating like the person who's
33:04 taking their money is pitching it in
33:06 some cases the businesses don't exist
33:08 they're fake corporations they're
33:10 showing them photographs of some other
33:11 location in the world which has nothing
33:13 to do with their proverbial location
33:16 that they're selling you know stock
33:18 bonds for whatever and they go to jail
33:24 for a very short period of time in most
33:26 cases right and to put it in perspective
33:29 you have to change the players if a
33:33 billionaire Ponzi scheme like a Milken
33:35 who sold junk bonds takes the world for
33:38 1.5 billion he just does a few years in
33:43 prison
33:44 it's pretty amazing but now if you were
33:48 to do business with say the United
33:50 States government and you took the
33:53 United States government for 1.5 billion
33:55 I'm thinking you're not gonna see the
33:58 light of day for a really long time why
34:01 is it different well why is it when your
34:05 grandparents get had there's there's no
34:11 real penalties I just learned that a
34:14 really good friend of mine put I think
34:17 about four hundred thousand dollars in
34:19 gold about ten years ago I'm assuming
34:26 based on the data from the deal they got
34:28 him in when gold was about seventeen
34:30 hundred dollars an ounce which happened
34:31 for a really short period of time his
34:34 broker sat on this thing and they
34:38 weren't real gold you didn't get coins
34:41 out of it or bullion that he could put
34:44 in a safety deposit box he got gold
34:47 certificates right commodity
34:49 certificates right which if you're gonna
34:51 invest in gold get the [ __ ] gold
34:53 would you at least you got something to
34:55 fall back on so he puts us money in and
35:02 the guy loses nearly all of it this is a
35:09 chunk of my friend's life savings thank
35:12 God he's got plenty more but the guy
35:15 didn't tell him for $400,000 that he was
35:21 losing it every single day at the end of
35:26 the entire run about a year and a half
35:27 later he came to my friend and said
35:29 sorry but we've lost it all now the firm
35:32 that did it made Commission fees off of
35:35 every maneuver they made with my friends
35:37 money so they never lost a dime in fact
35:41 who knows who he bought those stock
35:46 certificates from those gold
35:47 certificates from could have bought it
35:48 from one of his more preferred clients
35:50 he said done where I got this sucker
35:52 over here if we need to liquidate for
35:55 mr. Johnson over there who's
35:56 you know 100 billion dollars in our
36:00 organization will bail him out with this
36:02 guy's money and [ __ ] this guy who's
36:04 nobody right but there was no recourse
36:08 for my friend to suggest that wait a
36:12 minute you know he's not an expert in
36:14 this stuff he was trusting this
36:17 individual and of course that's where
36:19 America at least I don't know about
36:20 Europe but America will say well that's
36:23 your responsibility you trusted the
36:26 wrong person but this is a major major
36:28 investment house right he had no
36:33 recourse even though the person once
36:35 they lost a hundred thousand dollars you
36:36 think that they would liquidate and move
36:39 it into something else or at least
36:41 notify the client and say hey look gold
36:43 is dropping you know our strategy with
36:47 gold is to say you stay in for 20 years
36:49 so we think it'll rebound or at least
36:52 you won't lose it all but they didn't
36:55 they would it was all gone hmm I tell
37:00 you a really funny story in my own
37:01 personal life I was I think I was 19
37:04 years old and so that would have been
37:08 about 1988 and I had a gentleman because
37:15 I was a big tech guy and my reputation
37:18 in certain circles penetrated deep into
37:22 various interesting places right and so
37:27 I had a dude come to me when I was 18 19
37:29 years old it was 19 and I was a lead
37:32 engineer at the turbo tax place for one
37:35 of the platforms and the guy pitched me
37:39 this new thing that was coming he said
37:44 there's this thing coming where all
37:45 these computers are going to be
37:46 networked together and the whole world's
37:49 gonna get to trade information they're
37:51 gonna get to sell things so you have
37:53 anything you want to sell you can sell
37:54 it online this this new thing I hope
37:58 you're sensing what I'm talking about
38:00 here he's talking about the goddamn
38:01 internet coming online in 1988 the hcg
38:06 HTTP protocol I don't think had been
38:09 completely invented and that was a
38:11 scrape out of sgml which was a sort of a
38:16 it's sort of an HTML version of
38:18 postscript if you will for those guys
38:20 that are techie now at the time I was
38:22 renting some space our garage a really
38:26 nice garage or a really wealthy family
38:29 so the son and I were always up to
38:32 something he was a little bit younger
38:33 than me but he was very very smart
38:35 still is and he and I got the the kit
38:40 this guy sent me this kit I think it was
38:43 like 500 bucks I think something like
38:46 that and it now looking back was
38:49 essentially the budding infrastructure
38:52 for the Internet and what he was
38:55 offering was a methodology for me to buy
38:58 a series of pcs put modem racks on him
39:02 and essentially be an Internet hub I
39:05 could offer services on my computers
39:08 that other computers didn't have it was
39:10 the beginning of the internet but I went
39:13 to the family and sat down and did a
39:15 whole presentation to them and of course
39:17 they couldn't conceive of what the hell
39:19 I was talking about and what they told
39:22 me was this sounds great this really
39:24 does sound great we know your techie
39:26 enough to be able to take advantage of
39:28 what this guy's offering we trust this
39:31 is a fairly decent opportunity but we
39:35 have recently seen last five years been
39:39 taken by a guy that Ponzi scheme dust
39:42 with a bunch of steel I don't know the
39:44 details of the venture they went into
39:47 but they said they were lured into
39:48 buying a bunch of steel commodities and
39:51 it fell through and they lost a bunch of
39:53 money I have no idea how much money they
39:55 lost it was enough to scar them badly so
40:00 what ended up happening was that I
40:04 missed out on an opportunity to get on
40:05 the internet about the time Beezus was
40:08 probably getting in on the internet
40:09 right I forgot how much money I needed
40:12 to really make this thing happen but
40:14 computers were not cheap back in those
40:15 days but because of a predatorial group
40:21 of people
40:22 the investors that I talk to we're not
40:25 going to invest in anything besides
40:27 their own business now who knows if I
40:31 would have been a would have been able
40:32 to make this a profitable deal but in
40:35 the end it was because of some [ __ ]
40:38 that I could get the money and that's
40:41 the way a lot of investments go right
40:44 and it's let's go into some of these
40:49 sort of predatorial folks for one second
40:51 here you have people that have dreams of
40:55 which they aren't capable of actually
40:58 fulfilling you they don't have the
41:00 devotion to keep the business going or
41:02 they don't have the knowledge base to
41:04 really move it to the next step in the
41:05 next step in the next step ok so
41:08 sometimes you'll invest in in folks that
41:10 are simply making mistakes and it's up
41:16 to you to figure out whether or not they
41:18 have the tenacity to pull it off so it's
41:22 kind of a kind of a homegrown adventure
41:24 but it's a legit adventure right you
41:27 don't know that someone doesn't have the
41:29 capability of doing something until they
41:30 fail right that's why the interview
41:32 process is really really important what
41:34 have you done before that's like this
41:36 where have you succeeded like this where
41:38 have you hung on to a project for five
41:40 years like this before do you understand
41:42 how difficult this is you know you have
41:44 to ask questions about you know what's
41:47 your family life liked you have newborns
41:49 you have to take care of you know how
41:51 many times do you think you should be on
41:52 vacation etc etc do you have a drinking
41:55 problem you have marital problems all
41:56 these things you have to ask those
41:57 questions I've got an entrepreneurial
42:00 video back in season one I believe
42:02 that's real important if you're in this
42:04 state you're gonna put some money in
42:06 something go watch those episodes first
42:08 before you cream yourself but then you
42:11 have folks that are blowing smoke they
42:15 don't really have a product now maybe
42:18 they would mind if the product showed up
42:20 you know they wouldn't mind if their
42:21 employees were actually able to pull off
42:23 the inventions that they're talking
42:24 about but you have these pitch guys that
42:27 run around and grab cash right and they
42:32 will
42:34 use all kinds of tactics on you to get
42:37 your juices flowing that are completely
42:40 deceptive one of the most common tactics
42:44 I see we're just gonna freestyle
42:46 deception here is that they will say
42:51 let's say they're getting into robotics
42:54 now right now in the world robotics is a
42:57 hot [ __ ] commodity man I mean it's so
42:59 hot but there's a limited amount of
43:03 people in the world that have the
43:04 scientific capability of really
43:06 innovating something that hasn't been
43:07 innovated so you're either gonna have to
43:08 be a super skilled knockoff artist or
43:10 you're gonna have to be someone as
43:11 ingenious that understands perhaps some
43:14 of the needs that aren't being met by
43:15 the current commitments and promises
43:17 from the industry maybe like true
43:19 artificial intelligence I don't know I
43:22 don't I'm not really concerned with the
43:24 details but what they will do and
43:26 they're their deck right their
43:28 presentation that they'll put together
43:30 in PowerPoint or keynote they're
43:32 bringing it to you to get you all juiced
43:33 up and it is a psychological attack on
43:37 your system right and these guys are
43:39 amazingly good at this I mean hats off
43:42 to their ability to tell story and get
43:44 you excited yeah that's their that's why
43:46 they get to drive around the Bentley and
43:48 meanwhile you're furnishing all the cash
43:50 and you're driving around in like a
43:52 Corolla right nothing against Corollas
43:54 but you know what I'm talking about
43:56 there's a difference in the quality of
43:58 life between the two of you what they
44:01 will do is they will quote the entire
44:04 industry and all the money that's going
44:07 to be put into this industry I'll give
44:09 you an example virtual reality for
44:12 instance has fallen on its face once
44:14 again oculus five years from now will be
44:17 an utter memory magic leap will never
44:19 get off the ground HTC vive will also be
44:22 a memory all this stuff will be a memory
44:24 even the augmented reality stuff
44:27 well it'll remain inside your telephone
44:29 so it'll use your camera and your
44:30 telephone or do funny things on your
44:32 desktop but none of it will make any
44:33 significant amount of money now there'll
44:37 be other things that pop out of maybe
44:38 hybrids for virtual reality surgeries
44:41 and that kind of stuff so there will be
44:43 some uses but it'd be very limited very
44:46 limited purse from what they said
44:48 but I was involved in a virtual reality
44:52 project through a start-up I created a
44:55 couple years ago and there's episodes
44:57 that I made while I was doing this
44:59 venture but I would go to give lectures
45:03 and stuff on it and colleges and and VR
45:06 groups and that kind of thing and I
45:07 would hear the other lectures trying to
45:09 stimulate everyone into getting involved
45:11 and one of the things that we would
45:13 constantly hear was that wall street
45:15 planned on investing the numbers varied
45:19 but it was between a hundred and two
45:20 hundred billion dollars we're gonna be
45:22 invested in VR and AR so this was gonna
45:27 be hot and you can't even fail right now
45:30 the reality was this I was involved with
45:35 folks that knew the biggest investors in
45:39 the world and that's really not an
45:41 exaggeration but we were offering was an
45:45 experience that the world is yet to have
45:49 but everybody who came to my little
45:51 laboratory and got to see it just a
45:56 tidbit of this experience talking again
46:00 heads of Studios heads of
46:02 special-effects outfits people that were
46:05 the top of the top of Hollywood maybe
46:08 they are the illusionists that make it
46:10 all happen they become in and see our
46:13 fairly small demo and they're they're
46:19 jaws were on the ground they were
46:20 utterly blown away
46:21 some people leapt away from the screen
46:23 when certain things would happen it was
46:27 all based on some 3d technology but
46:31 again we did it in a way that no one
46:32 else had done it I'm still working on
46:35 this venture but I'm working on a
46:36 different capacity but we couldn't find
46:39 these investors that seemed to be giving
46:42 infinite cash to projects like magic
46:45 leap oculus and HTC vive right but our
46:52 offering was a hundred times better than
46:55 any of those our other offerings it
46:58 didn't require that your war headset
47:00 so we designed a platform that allowed
47:03 an audience to have a mutual experience
47:04 that was you know again no one on planet
47:09 earth has ever had this experience
47:11 except the people that came to see our
47:13 demo and even our demo wasn't able to
47:15 take advantage of all of the ingenuity
47:17 that we had put into the system so how
47:20 did the other guys make the money hmm
47:23 well there's nothing more luring than
47:25 having a sort of finished prototype that
47:27 you can put on some buttons head and say
47:29 this just needs to be polished and you
47:31 can be sold it's definitely an advantage
47:32 there but what I see is that someone
47:35 walk in and again claim the full metric
47:37 of a particular sector and say well like
47:43 your buddy will come in and say hey I'm
47:44 going to get into the the citrus termite
47:48 business right and what they do is they
47:50 run off and grab the metrics of
47:51 pesticide pest control maybe it's a say
47:55 a billion dollar industry per year but
47:58 they'll go to the neighbor and say look
47:59 this is a billion dollar industry and if
48:00 we can just capture 1% of a billion
48:02 dollars boom we're rolling in cash right
48:05 so I just need to borrow half a million
48:07 dollars out of your life savings so that
48:09 we can capture this 10 million dollar
48:12 industry for ourselves right so people
48:15 coughing up but there's no real
48:20 connection between the person pitching
48:21 you this thing and the big money that's
48:23 out there the big money that's out there
48:26 is held by usually you know 60 to 80%
48:31 it's held by one player and the business
48:33 right like I always try to remind people
48:35 I work for Electronic Arts we were the
48:37 first company I think in 1999 we had a
48:40 billion dollars the next year I think we
48:42 hit three billion dollars in gross sales
48:44 for the first video game company never
48:46 pull that off okay
48:49 today EA is number two Activision
48:53 Blizzard is number one but what's the
48:55 difference between number one and number
48:56 two with a market cap and again this is
48:59 old data by a couple years old when I
49:02 last looked it up but the market cap for
49:04 Activision Blizzard I think was around
49:05 twenty four point nine billion dollars
49:08 okay now that that doesn't mean they're
49:11 making that per year but EA's market
49:14 last time I looked it up was about seven
49:16 billion so Activision and their business
49:21 model were way more successful being a
49:23 publisher that being technically the
49:26 game developer they just found studios
49:28 making hot products signed them up and
49:30 they had the distribution around the
49:32 world now which is now largely just
49:35 digital distribution online but they
49:38 create these famous stores and people
49:40 pay money to get in those stores because
49:41 they get preferential promotion out of
49:44 thin air right so number two is a lot
49:47 different than number one well if you're
49:51 vesting in a new business you're usually
49:53 not anywhere close to that
49:55 so to muscle out companies that have
49:58 been Ian's of dollars per year it's
50:00 pretty hard to do okay
50:02 now could there have been a way that
50:05 Little Richard sells his entire catalog
50:08 knowing what he's doing would that would
50:11 have been less criminal again what
50:16 happened to him back in the day was
50:17 technically not a crime because the laws
50:20 supported the record companies that did
50:22 that to him I believe it was motley crue
50:25 and maybe even van Halen I can't
50:28 remember but one of those two bands sold
50:31 their entire catalogue prints sold his
50:34 catalogue for sure now the rumor was
50:37 that prints made anywhere from 150
50:40 million to like a hundred million he
50:43 disputed that in interviews afterwards
50:44 but I think that the catalogues of other
50:47 bands have gone up to 800 million
50:49 dollars and of course to make an
50:51 investment such that they you know they
50:54 do the math they say how many records do
50:55 you sell every single month this many
50:57 okay are you one to anymore not really
51:00 we're just doing kind of reunion stuff
51:01 we're not writing new music so this is
51:03 it so I think that the way that could
51:07 have been more ethical
51:09 maybe that's the word we should be using
51:12 on this episode title somehow would be
51:16 that Little Richard's done he's in the
51:18 80s he's made a ton of money off of his
51:22 catalog because he's owned the entire
51:24 time and he makes a strategic decision
51:27 he's like look
51:28 it's not that I'm not gonna go out and
51:29 play my own music and make money off of
51:32 touring and that kind of thing but the
51:34 royalties I get off these records is not
51:37 that intense anymore so let's say he
51:39 made again I got a buddy of mine that I
51:43 may interview next year and I can't
51:47 reveal numbers but he's very very
51:49 successful musician but when I heard the
51:52 numbers coming in off of the royalties
51:56 off of record sales for bands that have
51:59 tons of platinum albums you know it's
52:02 not what you think it's not what you
52:04 think you got to generate money from
52:05 something else if you want to keep up
52:07 your lifestyle otherwise you had you
52:09 would have had to have invested your
52:10 your money very wisely right you know
52:15 you have to live off of your your
52:16 dividends of other things so a little
52:20 richer might say look he's making let's
52:23 say $50,000 a year off of his catalogue
52:27 and he's like look I'm only gonna live X
52:30 number of years he puts that on paper
52:32 more I said we decides to sells catalog
52:36 for 50 million dollars because for him
52:39 he's like I'll never make that much
52:40 money from the royalties and if I decide
52:42 to stop touring at least I have the
52:44 money in the bank and I got some
52:45 investment ideas and bah-bah-bah and he
52:49 can do that and it's a very ethical
52:50 upfront negotiation when you write film
52:54 for instance yeah well if you're unknown
52:58 you're gonna get obviously a much
53:00 smaller purchase price for your script
53:02 then you would be if you were known to
53:05 to knock it out now they may look at
53:07 your script and go oh my god this thing
53:08 is gonna be worth a billion - right but
53:11 let's see if we can't get the script for
53:12 like a hundred fifty thousand dollars a
53:14 famous script writer yeah they might be
53:17 able to make seven hundred fifty
53:18 thousand to a million dollars same exact
53:21 product it's gonna gross the same amount
53:23 of money but because you're new you're
53:25 like Jesus I gotta get into this
53:26 industry and yes there are unions that
53:30 try to help you out and there's agencies
53:32 that try to help you out but then the
53:34 agencies
53:36 we'll do business with the studios and
53:39 they'll make money off the film they you
53:42 know they negotiate the sale the script
53:44 so you get your money and depending on
53:46 how tenacious you are and how
53:48 knowledgeable you are about the business
53:50 they will if they get the movie greenlit
53:53 which is a miracle they'll work out
53:57 points with the studio movie makes
54:01 billion dollars they get a point there's
54:03 a 10 10 million dollar straight into the
54:05 agency so then you start to become a hot
54:08 commodity
54:08 within the agency like keep that guy
54:10 happy because he just made his 10
54:12 million dollars plus a little scratch
54:14 off of his script whatever he needs
54:18 let's just keep him well fed they'll be
54:21 willing to put a hundred grand into you
54:22 write it come to you and say what you're
54:25 working on now I got these four scripts
54:27 ideas which one do you think is you know
54:29 more apt to sell in the next couple
54:31 years and they're all definitely that
54:32 one right there okay do you need
54:33 anything like yeah well you know I would
54:35 like to get out of LA to write this one
54:37 you know it's got that tropical for you
54:38 mind if I go to Hawaii to write this one
54:41 you're like yeah we'll put you up
54:43 ourselves we'll take it right out of our
54:44 own purse because if you hit it again
54:46 like you did in the previous script
54:49 maybe it's worth a point in half maybe
54:52 it's worth two points
54:53 whatever I'm just making all this up in
54:55 terms of the points but you're worth
54:58 money to them right we know that society
55:01 is very docile to manipulation and being
55:04 taken advantage of it's almost like the
55:06 society society itself can't defend
55:08 itself and so this is how this stuff
55:12 continues to get more acidic and more
55:14 predatorial and then when someone gets
55:18 screwed there's a weird little
55:19 phenomenon that happens in society if
55:24 it's you getting screwed you're pissed
55:26 off if it's your grandmother uncle your
55:29 father your mother your wife your
55:31 husband your kids you're pissed off and
55:34 you want justice but in America we have
55:38 this thing that's really weird I know it
55:41 exists in other places but I can only
55:42 speak for place I come from you know one
55:46 of the reasons why tabloid news is so
55:49 lucrative is that people people want to
55:54 see people who have things lose things
55:57 they love it well at least somebody got
56:01 it right they might feel like they're
56:04 getting screwed because they perhaps
56:05 mismanaged your life or perhaps they're
56:07 just the victim of circumstances they've
56:09 done everything right according to the
56:10 books but they're eating it it's so they
56:14 want some sort of posthumous retaliation
56:17 and so everyone Huddle's around to see
56:21 people get eaten by lions right what
56:25 didn't the Coliseum was all about back
56:27 in the day the more that Rome and the
56:30 current Caesar repressed the people they
56:33 took it they got their relief by seeing
56:35 innocent people torn to pieces right I
56:39 mean you may have a thief down there but
56:41 he's not you know he's not committed a
56:43 crime that you know is punishable by
56:47 lion eating right so I think society as
56:52 a whole has to take their own suffering
56:55 and say instead of reveling in someone
56:59 else's suffering to act as a therapeutic
57:01 aid they're gonna have to say wait a
57:05 minute this should be happening at all
57:07 to anyone because I wouldn't want to
57:09 happen to me to go back to France for a
57:12 second was very interesting that we
57:17 believe that we have pretty decent
57:18 history when the French Revolution took
57:21 place in the late or the early 1790s
57:24 right was 1793 I think that people
57:28 started getting their heads cut off
57:29 right but someone said in my smoke
57:32 lounge well you know back in those days
57:34 when this started happening they just
57:36 got absolutely crazy but cut people's
57:38 heads off the crowd would just point at
57:40 someone and say that guy they grab them
57:45 there's no trial there's no evidence
57:47 that's presented raining doesn't know
57:49 representation you got pushed down in
57:52 front of that guillotine they chopped
57:53 your head off maybe you were completely
57:56 innocent but no matter what you know a
57:59 crime is not always punishable by
58:02 capital punishment
58:03 death it was said in China when mal sank
58:09 tongue became the I guess the president
58:13 and you call him that
58:13 Emperor whatever I don't know what they
58:15 call them over there but he had two
58:18 phases of mass murders where they
58:21 estimate up to 40 million people were
58:23 murdered and again there's no there's no
58:26 Holocaust Museum to that [ __ ] but they
58:31 as I had to describe to me by a person
58:33 who studies Chinese history a lot
58:36 the first beheadings that they used to
58:40 do with swords was that they had a lot
58:43 of slumlord landlords for real people
58:46 that were just you know forcing people
58:50 live in squalor never fixing anything
58:51 people getting say from malnutrition
58:53 bah-bah-bah and so they had this point
58:56 we're just like Francis you know
58:58 starting to push back they grabbed all
59:01 the landlords and cut their heads off
59:03 and everyone's watching you know
59:05 everyone's their little kids are
59:06 watching and then the second phase went
59:13 on to the the resistors of the
59:16 government because the government said
59:18 to the people you see we got something
59:22 and done the bad guys got it
59:25 so we're good we let you kill your
59:28 landlords now do us a favor kill
59:32 everyone who resists us and they did
59:36 whole another set of killings just
59:40 anyone who accused anyone wrong place
59:42 wrong time no trial no nothing you got
59:46 killed we got to be careful we don't do
59:49 this again and that's why it's dangerous
59:53 when history isn't really taught Russia
59:58 had his dark day as well I think that
60:01 the the genetics that exist in Russia
60:06 are probably not bound to repeat their
60:08 history as they did around World War two
60:11 and because of World War two they had a
60:14 big
60:16 big group of people that were murdered
60:17 because they didn't want to fight the
60:20 the Nazis because the Nazis had it
60:24 dialed in you know they had a massive
60:26 technology strategy on the battlefield I
60:29 mean they were blitzkrieg the [ __ ] out
60:30 of Russia for a little while until just
60:33 like Napoleon
60:34 they lost their army due to the seasons
60:36 the winter season which is brutal and
60:39 Russia Russia is almost perfectly
60:42 protected by their winters it's amazing
60:45 but now we have seen a bit of a turn
60:48 recently I think it was Monsanto
60:50 recently lost a case to a gentleman here
60:52 in California who was told that dealing
60:56 with glyphosate which is roundup to
60:58 treat his crops after you bought the GMO
61:01 seeds was a safe thing to handle he
61:04 ended up getting terminal cancer he's
61:07 still alive but he won in court I
61:09 believe that the winnings were nearly
61:12 half a billion dollars 480 something
61:15 million I think and I believe they
61:17 awarded him more money than he asked for
61:19 which is a it happens right when you get
61:22 a good jury but we have people that kill
61:25 people that get off scot-free and it's
61:29 not always a act of self-defense
61:33 sometimes it's straight-up premeditated
61:36 first-degree murder but there'll be
61:38 politics to let someone off scot-free
61:41 the the illegal immigrant in San
61:45 Francisco that got off killing this
61:46 woman Kate I think he committed a crime
61:51 within six months of being let off right
61:54 the judicial system the judicial system
61:57 I should say in America you know you try
62:02 things in front of a judge to the point
62:05 the case gets appealed up to a jury
62:08 trial and then we as the people have to
62:14 make the difference and my fear is that
62:17 as long as the laws are always sort of
62:22 capable of being interpreted that a lot
62:26 of times they'll tell you that something
62:27 was legal even
62:29 though great harm was done to someone
62:31 and so you might be told by a judge you
62:34 have to follow the letter of the law and
62:37 so corporations get away scot-free with
62:39 this stuff if Chuck Berry had taken his
62:42 case to court which I don't know if he
62:44 ever did he would lose most likely
62:50 although everyone walking out of the
62:52 court would know he got screwed all
62:55 right well how do you counteract that
62:57 right well the best way would be to
63:00 change the laws and that's something we
63:02 need to do but maybe the the fix and the
63:06 short term is to simply be good human
63:08 beings to each other there should be a
63:11 class-action lawsuit of my opinion
63:13 against Apple Computer our apples they
63:15 call themselves today for slowing down
63:17 devices intentionally oh maybe it's
63:20 legal but in the end if I came in C I
63:25 sold you your house and then I come back
63:28 by and ring the doorbell and I say look
63:30 you know I know I sold you your house
63:31 but you know this driveway that was all
63:33 cracked
63:34 you know the cement was all split up
63:37 this patio is pretty split up right here
63:39 but they come back and offer me a new
63:42 driveway a new patio I say okay and they
63:46 replace it with something that's
63:47 absolutely horrible it's so horrible
63:50 that now I can't use it anymore can't
63:52 park my car in the driveway can't come
63:53 out on the patio
63:54 something's wrong with it it's toxic it
63:57 cracks even worse well it look good for
64:00 a few days but then it was bad well you
64:04 agreed to let me put this inferior
64:06 product on top of a product that even
64:08 though it was injured was still
64:09 performing better than the one I
64:10 replaced it with oh you signed all the
64:14 documents to let me do it
64:15 maybe you signed a little indemnity
64:18 clause that said I'm not responsible for
64:20 whatever happens to this thing me the
64:21 guy who's them I should say that
64:23 replaced this this previous product you
64:29 should be able to take me to court and
64:31 say look I had a completely functional
64:32 driveway yeah it was correct so
64:34 cosmetically it wasn't the most
64:36 beautiful thing in the world but I could
64:37 at least use it these people told me
64:40 they're gonna replace it with something
64:41 better
64:41 turned out to be a couple
64:43 bunk experience they pawned off some
64:45 cheap crap on me
64:46 charged me full price if you're gonna
64:49 upgrade your phone let's just say with a
64:52 new operating system away from the
64:53 original and they're not telling you
64:56 that this is gonna slow down your phone
64:58 slow down your computer and what
65:01 percentage of which that's going to
65:02 occur based on the model of your
65:04 computer and the version of the
65:06 operating system
65:06 I'd say that's a crime that's just my
65:11 opinion now some of you might be
65:14 thinking this just go into Apple devices
65:16 you might be thinking well all I have to
65:20 do is get out my original discs that
65:21 came with the computer and reinstall the
65:24 operating system that was compatible
65:25 with my processor but they got you
65:29 there's something called the ROM update
65:32 it's this weird little update that
65:35 happens inside your hardware the
65:37 software in your Hardware gets upgraded
65:40 and no matter if you roll back the
65:42 operating system that ROM is still
65:44 making everything slow and so you're
65:46 screwed I've had hardware tech guys
65:49 refute this with me and so I asked him I
65:53 say ones last time you wrote some code
65:54 on a write code I replace screens on
65:58 telephones and then I'm sitting there
65:59 going well then shut the [ __ ] up you
66:01 have no technical know-how as to how a
66:03 processor interprets instructions from a
66:06 software set right but they're the guys
66:10 that will set up their their fanboys or
66:13 whatever their job is related to this or
66:16 whatever and they perpetuate the
66:19 deception because they don't want to
66:20 have to deal with the repercussions so
66:24 you'll have those people to what baffles
66:27 me is that and I've said this in
66:28 previous episodes but why do people by
66:31 Honda and Toyota because it has the best
66:35 resale value of any automotive company
66:37 on planet Earth it's got easy
66:40 maintenance the cars barely need any
66:43 maintenance then go for two to three
66:44 hundred thousand miles before they
66:46 really start crapping the bed
66:47 that's value well I got friends of mine
66:51 that won't buy anything but Honda
66:54 friends of mine that won't buy anything
66:56 but tell you
66:57 because they get that value out of the
66:59 system and can you blame them so what
67:03 does any company want from its customers
67:05 they want loyalty
67:07 what would a record company want from
67:09 musician's loyalty right you got a band
67:13 it's just coming up in your neighborhood
67:15 they are a badass man they play whatever
67:17 music you love and they play it
67:19 perfectly well now they have a commodity
67:22 that they get to market to record
67:24 companies and again record companies
67:26 have changed quite a bit while most I'm
67:28 out of business but most of them are
67:30 that have been forced to come up with
67:32 better contracts you do own your masters
67:34 and all this other stuff but it took you
67:37 know 50 years of [ __ ] to get people
67:41 to go in with their commodity and saying
67:44 look you're not the only record company
67:47 in town so unless you give me a decent
67:48 contract you're not getting my business
67:52 okay I'll give you good contract but
67:56 they're still trying to screw you as
67:57 much as they possibly can right that's
67:59 the name of the game you just need a few
68:01 landmark cases before things change
68:04 what if Apple got nailed for this
68:08 deception game they're playing where
68:10 they slow down your devices on purpose
68:13 people don't take it anymore they put
68:15 down their fluoridate a toothbrush they
68:18 refuse the vaccinations whatever it
68:20 takes
68:21 they eat meat they realize they do have
68:25 a resistance gene inside of them it's
68:28 not resistance against being treated
68:30 nicely its resistance to get against
68:32 getting screwed we stand up and we shove
68:35 a class-action lawsuit brought up the
68:36 pooper of some of these corporations and
68:40 they lose because the jury is like yeah
68:43 you were going to end by the way it's
68:46 pretty simple fix on Apple's part
68:48 especially but the courts say here's
68:52 what you're gonna pay everybody out of
68:53 your whatever it is two hundred billion
68:56 dollars in cash you got in the bank this
68:57 is what you're gonna pay every former
68:59 customer of yours for damages because
69:02 again if you have to buy a new phone in
69:04 two years
69:05 that's damages because you can't use
69:08 your previous phone
69:09 because it's too damn slow to type one
69:12 again something that a sub mega her
69:15 computer could do at 120 words per
69:17 minute with no problem back in 1980
69:21 so again if they're gonna brag about
69:23 Moore's law where everything gets twice
69:25 as fast and a certain interval then you
69:28 can't have things slowing down because
69:31 they haven't been able to double the
69:34 megahertz of a computer for more than 15
69:36 years right
69:38 we should have six eager hurt machines
69:39 today not be so impressed that we can
69:42 have five right but all they need to do
69:45 to fix your computer fix your phone your
69:47 tablet whatever you have that's been
69:49 slowed down does they take the operating
69:51 system and they compile it for the
69:55 processor that's inside your device they
69:57 redo the ROM so it's built for your
70:00 device your full schematics of your
70:02 hardware you would install that update
70:05 which would just simply sense what model
70:07 you're running on and your device would
70:10 instantaneously go back to the way it
70:12 was the day you bought it hell if they
70:14 ever wrote tighter code it would be even
70:16 faster right if you have a hundred lines
70:20 of code and you can reduce it to ten
70:22 well when you're onboarding all the
70:26 instructions into the processor it's
70:29 done 10 times faster so I think you feel
70:31 me we just freestyle this one today let
70:34 me freestyle all of them but I didn't I
70:36 didn't sit down with anything on my mind
70:38 but this is sort of getting at this
70:40 thing I wanted to go after Apple because
70:42 it used to be a fantastic company Steve
70:45 Jobs is definitely responsible for
70:47 creating this intentional obsolescence
70:50 he wrote tons of emails about this kind
70:53 of thing so it's definitely where he and
70:55 I differ when I had the privilege of
70:57 working with his team he sent his was as
71:02 Acting CFO and really his real title was
71:07 head of worldwide development slash
71:09 strategies and that kind of thing but
71:11 Apple was less global at the time than
71:13 they are today we sat and had a couple
71:15 beers and you know he was really
71:18 interested in my opinion about you know
71:21 how to strategize the company moving
71:23 which I thought was pretty phenomenal
71:27 but the thing I said to him was you know
71:29 the iMac was out at the time and just
71:31 cleaning up house man it was like a
71:33 $1,300 computer $12.99 and you know we
71:36 all know the story absolutely blew up
71:38 and put them back on the map but they
71:40 were about to come out with their
71:41 GeForce which were you know the graphite
71:45 g-force which were amazing I still have
71:48 one that he gave me and I told him I
71:53 said look you got a you know if you want
71:54 to put yourself back on the map you're
71:56 really gonna have to create a blazingly
71:58 fast computer for a really inexpensive
71:59 price there's just no other way around
72:01 it because people are now at the time
72:03 walking away from your products this was
72:06 1999 and you know they said you know
72:11 they're definitely we're thinking about
72:12 that kind of strategy and I think when
72:13 the g4 came out I can't remember what it
72:15 cost but it was super affordable for the
72:17 amount of horsepower that you got I mean
72:18 it smoked any PC that I had so my my
72:23 personal issue with Apple was that I
72:26 thought okay you do this curse it wasn't
72:29 as bad as it is today - so the thing was
72:32 is that we can all kind of sense things
72:33 were slowing down after software updates
72:35 but at the time we went from sort of
72:38 casual GUI interfaces to seriously
72:42 layered interfaces but being in the game
72:45 industry I had a very privileged view as
72:49 to what these processors could do and so
72:53 let me give you just a little litmus
72:55 test that you can use when you are
73:00 thinking about this okay a couple Atmos
73:03 tests are one these computers haven't
73:05 gotten much faster but they continually
73:07 get slower the older that they get and
73:09 the only get slower after your software
73:10 update period right but you want you
73:14 know I mean the last probably four or
73:15 five updates of the Mac OS offered you
73:18 nothing I mean there it was just more
73:20 social media crap stuck in your
73:21 operating system that you don't want
73:22 right all these [ __ ] notifications the
73:25 last one Mojave is actually pretty cool
73:28 got dark mode which I love dearly but my
73:33 hope was that they would cease doing
73:35 this right
73:37 now they're giving it to you for free
73:39 that's the other thing too so I think
73:40 there might be some some legalese and
73:43 identification because hey you don't
73:45 have to download this and we're giving
73:46 it to you for free so we don't owe you
73:48 any money but they're still damages when
73:51 you know like I had a computer that was
73:55 well within the three gigahertz rate
73:57 eight processors and I got this
73:59 graphical job for a buddy in mind to do
74:02 promotions for a very famous movie chain
74:05 here in Los Angeles only and I had to
74:08 deal with you know really gigantic files
74:10 by probably files that are anywhere from
74:13 150 Meg to 350 make super high res
74:16 thinks I'm generalist composite work
74:18 okay my computer couldn't handle it
74:22 eventually it just got to the point
74:24 we're watching a filter go I could go
74:26 get you know a cup of coffee and the
74:28 time it took to complete and so I went
74:30 to my garage and I found one of my
74:32 computers from a game company that was
74:34 much newer than the one I had and so I
74:36 pulled it in swapped it out started
74:38 running the plugins and it was really
74:40 fast
74:41 I was thinking wait a minute these two
74:43 computers are identical and megahertz
74:45 both 64-bit just a couple years apart
74:48 from each other one was a 2008 one was
74:50 2010 I was doing this work in like 13 so
74:54 that's how recent these computers were
74:56 so I was able to get back on my feet and
74:58 to move all my software and files over
75:01 and then of course with a couple updates
75:04 that computer became unusable
75:06 I mean unusable at least in a
75:09 professional capacity but even boot
75:11 times took a really long time I now have
75:14 a computer that is going on let's see
75:18 two years old I bought the
75:21 top-of-the-line top-of-the-line
75:22 everything you could put in there boost
75:24 the processor boost the memory all that
75:26 good stuff and now I'm starting to see
75:29 the fatigue starting to wait for things
75:31 I didn't used to wait for well it's
75:34 obviously Mojave which updated my rom
75:38 I've got an Android note 3 that is still
75:42 pretty damn fast it's got a battery
75:43 issue I need to replace I don't use it
75:46 anymore but cuz I upgraded my phone but
75:49 I was able to wait
75:51 I guess five years before updated it
75:54 super cool there used to be a time you
75:58 only got a trophy if you won the game
76:00 now they don't want to hurt anyone's
76:01 feelings so they hand out trophies to
76:03 all the kids I personally don't know how
76:06 a child looks at a trophy for losing and
76:08 feels any alkylate in their heart but
76:11 maybe they do the laws have started to
76:14 become the loser trophy you screw
76:18 someone over you don't win but somehow
76:23 we feel better or something I don't get
76:25 it I think some people say oh don't sue
76:28 that poor corporation I love them I have
76:32 their logo all over my [ __ ] it's bad
76:36 enough that probably 2/3 of the products
76:38 sold in America if not higher are made
76:41 exclusively by what we would classify a
76:43 slave labor you know and the poverty
76:46 index again I've lamented on the show
76:48 that you know some countries you can
76:50 make 2 dollars and 50 cents a day and
76:52 you're living just as good as someone
76:54 making 120 thousand dollars a year here
76:56 several hundred dollars a day here right
76:59 so I'm not as concerned about that as I
77:02 am them working 16-hour days six days a
77:05 week to facilitate a want and a Western
77:10 country but as soon as like what was it
77:16 the woman that used to have used to be
77:17 the sidekick of Regis the Regis show for
77:20 Kathie Lee I think is her name she got
77:22 busted for getting clothing made by
77:24 sweatshops in South America or something
77:27 in China I forgot where it was right she
77:31 gets crucified for a slave labor but a
77:36 corporation that does it that has a
77:37 polished really nice box that tries to
77:40 you know block everyone from walking in
77:42 their store to create a line out front
77:44 they're good they're good right I'm just
77:48 calling out an area I think we need to
77:49 talk about a little bit anyway if you
77:52 have them into deep thoughts radio.com
77:53 please go there's audio video a lock
77:55 facebook group and a patreon page I do a
77:58 short bumper today take care of yourself
78:00 in someone else when I'm seeing the next
78:01 deep thoughts over now
78:03 [Music]
78:12 you
