00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts today as you can see we're
00:39 gonna talk about Karma
00:41 it was a user or listener suggestion and
00:46 I think it's an awesome one the Karma
00:50 I'm gonna warn you right off the bat
00:52 about the way I'm gonna approach this it
00:57 is a deep part of many religions
01:01 especially the Hindu religions they have
01:05 devoted millennia times millennia to
01:09 this notion we are going to borrow
01:14 probably some sentiments from those
01:16 passages but like all things I don't
01:20 step inside religion to figure out how
01:22 that my life I listened to it and gained
01:25 the concepts because there are generally
01:27 concepts of man if they were concepts of
01:30 God there would be no mystery in them
01:33 and we would not have any inquiry it
01:37 would seem that if there is a creator
01:38 and this is a side note before we get
01:40 into Karma then all the Creator does is
01:44 really help us to live this life a
01:46 little bit better
01:47 there isn't a deterministic manual that
01:50 tells us how to live our life and
01:53 ironically karma would only be a
01:57 byproduct if we didn't have a
01:59 deterministic life now I will most
02:01 likely do I can't remember I don't think
02:03 I've done anything on determinism it is
02:06 something worth discussing as well
02:07 perhaps I'll do it next karma karma in
02:14 its simplest form is the definition of
02:18 action reaction
02:20 there's causality for the things that
02:22 you do the butterfly and Peru changing
02:28 the price of tea in China
02:29 right the butterfly effect in the case
02:33 of the butterfly effect effect it's
02:35 usually the definition of serendipity
02:38 now everything is integrated and
02:40 therefore your actions do affect the
02:43 entire planet and I think it's true
02:47 may take a long time for a kid dropping
02:49 a ball and you know Russia to affect
02:53 some banker in Chicago but eventually as
02:56 long as they live long enough the
03:00 carrier wave is gonna come and touch the
03:03 other person as well as the infinite
03:05 carrier waves that move all over the
03:07 world surface right but usually when you
03:11 talk about Karma in a smoke lounge or
03:14 with your friends it's very very simple
03:17 the question is do you believe in karma
03:20 and it will usually come after we have
03:23 discussed some deep state heretic who we
03:28 know commits outrageous crimes appears
03:31 to be paying no price for anything that
03:33 they do and we want them to pay a price
03:36 we want the world to have some as we
03:39 would perceive it
03:40 naively to find fairness now for those
03:46 of you who are deep thoughts aficionados
03:49 you'll know that my definition of
03:50 fairness almost contradicts the
03:54 definition of fairness handed down down
03:56 by an SJ WR snowflake the snowflake
04:01 defines fairness as essentially an
04:04 unfair game what is fair fair is that
04:08 you win all the time fair is that you
04:09 get everything that you want that's
04:10 what's fair when you don't get what you
04:13 want you hear little children say but
04:15 that's not fair
04:16 now we do know obviously and our own
04:20 personal experiences sometimes we work
04:21 really really hard and you think that
04:25 you put enough effort in to get
04:27 something to work and it didn't work
04:29 something that wasn't related to your
04:31 effort failed and so you lost the
04:36 fairness is that anything can happen and
04:38 that that beautiful symmetry of chaos
04:42 never ends anything could happen that's
04:45 what's fair you can get hit by a tree
04:47 soak in your neighbor right I teach that
04:53 I've told the story a couple times one
04:55 of my epiphanies in life for figuring
04:59 out what fairness may or may not be
05:01 my parents put me in Cub Scouts to you
05:04 undergoing Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts you
05:07 have to carve this car out of a block of
05:09 wood right and the box was printed and
05:12 designed in the 50s and so they have
05:14 this this little illustration on the
05:17 outside of the box is too how how the
05:19 car could look now as a child eight
05:21 years old I thought that's the way it
05:23 was supposed to look my dad was working
05:25 24/7 wasn't it on they put me in Cub
05:28 Scouts to remind me my father was
05:29 working a lot this really just dumb as
05:32 [ __ ] but whatever so I'm in the garage
05:35 with a hacksaw and I am cutting this
05:40 thing you know I'm motorized tools and
05:43 I'm figuring just say I cut it exactly
05:44 like the Box said I remember my mom
05:46 coming in once getting dinner fixed you
05:49 know and she's just watching me I'm
05:51 eight years old I'm just using power
05:53 tools and [ __ ] no concern we cut my
05:55 fingers off which is honestly what I
05:58 love about my childhood my relationship
05:59 with my parents but at one point you got
06:03 a pound in four nails for the wheels and
06:06 you take it to this
06:08 yes competition it's I didn't even know
06:11 was a competition I thought it was just
06:12 yet we're all making these things we're
06:13 gonna have fun with them no is the
06:15 competition there was this ramp right
06:17 and I get to this room with all these
06:20 guys and their dads and their dads have
06:24 [ __ ] tricked these things out man
06:26 they have caught off every single piece
06:28 of wood that you could possibly cut off
06:30 painted crew room with like [ __ ] you
06:33 know flames down the side I mean just
06:36 super cool right and I'm looking at this
06:38 piece of [ __ ] I made and I'm liking well
06:41 damn you guys are eight - like how did
06:43 you get these things - oh the father's
06:45 made them Oh mine's not there okay and
06:48 so they put them in the slots they let
06:51 go this little you know little ramp door
06:53 and everyone else is just beautifully
06:56 went down and mine goes down and it's
06:58 literally on the incline it might just
07:00 go it stops because my front left tire I
07:02 didn't get the nail right again I had no
07:06 idea what these things are gonna be used
07:07 for no one stepped in on the adult side
07:10 now I could have said that's
07:13 fare their dads built their cars and I
07:17 did say that when I was a little kid in
07:19 the end the lesson I learned was
07:22 profound that you know life is gonna be
07:28 like that you're gonna have
07:30 opportunities that other people don't
07:34 have and you're not gonna have
07:35 opportunities that they have right my
07:38 dad came home pretty much within that
07:40 time slot and gave me a motorcycle I'm
07:44 eight years old he teaches me how to use
07:46 it for two seconds he's like there go
07:48 have fun okay and I'm sort of driving
07:51 around the woods so I had this freedom
07:53 that the other kids didn't it was crazy
07:56 I ran my own world it was cool so even
08:00 though my little car didn't go down well
08:02 I had other things that they didn't have
08:03 it was fair because anything could
08:07 happen but karma karma is this bizarre
08:13 notion believe me I talk about this all
08:18 the time and I'll tell you my personal
08:21 philosophies of this but you know this
08:23 isn't gonna be as romantic in and
08:25 beautiful as the Hindu was it the feta
08:29 and all these different takes on this
08:31 when you read all the definitions of
08:33 karma over thousands of years which you
08:36 end up doing is finding out that they
08:38 obviously we're just trying to make
08:41 people feel better trying to account for
08:43 things that maybe they observed but
08:46 trying to reassure everyone don't worry
08:47 even though you got sucker punched in
08:49 the face or whatever that person's gonna
08:52 pay the price and it makes you feel
08:53 better and you go home but that isn't
08:57 the case is it [ __ ] die all the time
08:59 having been pedophiles their entire
09:02 lives right I said Bill Clinton and
09:05 Hillary Clinton have lived pretty good
09:07 life alright if karma was real at least
09:12 in this from life to life your life that
09:16 the one that you're in right now and if
09:18 it somehow paid off in the end
09:20 there's nothing we can do to those two
09:22 people that would ever
09:24 ever hold them accountable for all the
09:27 suffering that they have inflicted on
09:29 this planet and they're just two of the
09:32 smallest perpetrators on this planet
09:36 smallest right as horrific as they might
09:41 have been on this planet there's not
09:45 enough years left in their life to give
09:47 them back the Karma of what they've done
09:49 destroying other people's lives killing
09:51 people torturing people selling kids
09:57 potentially jeopardizing the future of
09:59 this planet with a bunch of deals that
10:01 were just made through the Hilary
10:03 foundation then we're gonna haunt us for
10:05 10 20 years perhaps things were gonna
10:08 have to undo and of course they didn't
10:11 do them alone mmm any one of you that
10:14 follows common law you know it's not
10:18 easy sometimes you find it difficult to
10:23 whisper because you want to shout it's
10:27 hard to walk away cuz I mean you want to
10:29 punch someone's teeth out right men and
10:33 women we have those feelings we do I
10:36 think the majority of us walk away and
10:40 just think it through and we try to
10:41 learn the lesson sometimes you have to
10:43 catch a predator catch a killer put
10:48 someone in jail for the crimes they've
10:49 committed against others we want there
10:52 to be Karma as long as the definition of
10:56 a crime is well within the wheelhouse of
10:59 our daily operations when we are trying
11:01 our very best to be a good person but if
11:06 if I told you I'll give you two
11:09 definitions of Karma and one you'll be
11:13 probably okay with and one you're gonna
11:16 be a little leery about you're gonna
11:17 want to think about this one a little
11:18 bit karma of the actions that you
11:21 actually do you act out in this world
11:25 you speak poorly you hurt someone you
11:30 steal from someone what if I said that
11:33 that externalization
11:36 of your internal intent out there in the
11:39 real world that is the only thing you're
11:40 gonna be judged by I think most
11:43 law-abiding citizens could deal with
11:45 that especially if there was a moment in
11:50 time where I said okay everything you've
11:51 done up to this point is forgotten we're
11:53 gonna turn the clock on now and the
11:55 system this monitoring system and when
11:58 you die we're gonna do something about
12:01 it most people would agree the physical
12:04 ones okay but now if I said okay the
12:07 definition of Karma is everything that
12:10 you think mmm [ __ ] well do you even
12:16 control your thoughts I mean you know
12:18 there's that alien consciousness out
12:19 there that sits there and toys with you
12:21 all day long you think this suspicious
12:23 thought about your lover about your wife
12:26 or your husband or your employer or
12:28 where your kid is right now the guy that
12:31 cut you off well you don't understand
12:35 that person's life
12:36 so you jump to conclusions right hmm I
12:41 think when it comes to comma of the mind
12:43 we would be very leery of turning that
12:46 system on until we figure out a way to
12:48 completely control our mind and then we
12:51 want to know korto sort of what is the
12:53 threshold of a sin a little tiny one a
12:56 big one is it all proportional meaning
12:59 do I always get back what I do hmm and
13:03 when does that happen by the way because
13:05 again George Soros is still alive
13:08 he's not dying of ass cancer you know
13:12 he's not on fire 24/7 so when does this
13:15 stuff show up mm-hmm some people think
13:19 he's dead some people and some religions
13:22 and through phases again we're going to
13:24 talk about this in just a second here
13:26 they believe that the Karma come back
13:27 comes back to you in this lifetime
13:30 others think that you personally in your
13:33 next incarnations you're going to start
13:36 paying the bill you know it's like a
13:38 credit card with compound interest
13:39 you're gonna pay the bill in your next
13:41 life okay some versions of karma it
13:47 infects your family
13:48 very interesting we can't even conceive
13:51 of that in the Western world today
13:53 because our families are so blown apart
13:56 by pop culture that we don't have we
13:59 expect to lose control of our family
14:01 your son and daughters all run away you
14:05 ditch your parents and they die in some
14:08 [ __ ] ditch somewhere right that's
14:10 just the American Way there's no sense
14:12 of community except for maybe in the
14:14 Midwest where we still hang on to some
14:16 of the traditions of this of this world
14:19 so can you imagine some you know
14:22 biological father of yours running off
14:24 you know early on your mom yeah it maybe
14:27 even raises you to you're a certain age
14:29 but then disappears and he's off
14:31 you know he's becoming a serial killer
14:33 he's a theft he's a thief scuse me
14:36 commits theft EFT right and then all of
14:40 a sudden it's imposed on you I think
14:43 right away as human beings again we may
14:47 not know what our Creator
14:48 if a creator deed exists would do but
14:51 that seems extremely unlikely because
14:55 it's not fair in a sense of cause and
14:58 effect right couldn't you see a society
15:01 though that actually had close
15:03 connections with all their kids and it
15:06 is simply a motivator to say your kid
15:09 better not start causing problems for
15:10 the village because you know that means
15:15 that you have a bad family line you have
15:17 a bad surname which means if we start to
15:21 think that you have a bad surname then
15:22 your amenities within this village are
15:24 gonna diminish considerably there was a
15:27 funny line in the movie under the cherry
15:29 moon spoke by Jerome he says don't have
15:32 kids with stupid people because then you
15:35 have stupid kids he goes don't believe
15:36 me he goes find a stupid kid follow him
15:38 home knock on the door and see if a
15:40 stupid person doesn't answer that is
15:44 most likely what's going on in this
15:45 planet I had been known to say for the
15:48 last 20 years of my life and this
15:51 there's a philosophy for this as well
15:53 and again probably I should stop for one
15:55 second just say the variations on karma
16:00 have tried to explain all of the
16:03 observable reality in man so someone
16:06 laid down this definition of karma and
16:08 then that wasn't happening in a village
16:11 and so someone said oh oh well there's
16:12 this other way it works and they created
16:15 a spin-off and then there's a spin-off
16:17 and a spin-off there's probably five or
16:19 six core spin-offs of karma different
16:23 gurus develop those spin-offs and
16:26 maintain those spin-offs and taught them
16:28 for any of you who studied ancient
16:30 astronomy when they were trying to
16:32 explain the Stars they said they're
16:34 painted on the inside of a glass you
16:37 know globe a sphere that goes around the
16:41 turtle of which we were on the back of
16:44 but they had wandering stars didn't they
16:46 they had moons and they had excuse me a
16:49 planets out there and moons around the
16:50 planets and it became complicated and so
16:53 the engineers back in the day the
16:56 cosmologists have thousands of years of
16:59 go said oh no no no okay what's
17:01 happening is there's another sphere
17:02 another glass sphere it's attached to
17:04 the big sphere and it's turning in its
17:05 own little rotation and then a click
17:08 attach to that sphere it's another
17:10 little sphere that accounts for the
17:12 moons everything was another sphere the
17:16 Comets that go by Halley's Comet right
17:19 okay that's what's happened to karma it
17:24 has fractured and fractured facture
17:26 because in observable reality there
17:29 seems to be a shortage of you know
17:33 trauma coming back to get its paycheck
17:37 now the interesting thing is you'll go
17:39 online YouTube and you can look up karma
17:42 videos in traffic and there'll be some
17:44 guy you know trying to cut somebody off
17:48 and then in doing so they immediately
17:49 wrecked their car and it's a karma event
17:51 or someone being very rude and then they
17:53 walk into a telephone pole and order
17:58 some traffic light pole or they walk
17:59 through a glass door I should say into
18:03 the glass door and then through it karma
18:05 sort of comes into effect when we have
18:10 you know extremes that occur in the
18:13 universe
18:15 some of you will remember my analogy of
18:19 turning it to 11 right when you are I
18:25 see it buy a new instrument you buy a
18:27 synthesizer this works for guitars and a
18:30 bunch of different stuff but there's
18:32 knobs on instruments right and you will
18:36 invariably plug everything in get the
18:39 sound going through your aunt and it
18:42 with the synthesizer you're designing a
18:44 wave you attack the decay what sort of
18:46 wave is going through is it a sawtooth
18:48 wave is it a smooth sine cosine wave
18:51 right but the way that you become
18:53 educated about each one of the knobs on
18:56 your keyboard or even just the pick up
18:58 volume on your on your Les Paul is that
19:03 you take it from zero and you smash it
19:05 all the way to ten and then to five and
19:08 then to zero and a five and ten you just
19:10 keep and you keep playing it or whatever
19:11 you got to do just edit it to date and
19:14 you start to understand how the thing
19:15 works right okay well now let me ask you
19:20 we acknowledge all the time the laws of
19:24 the universe don't we you know on this
19:28 show gravity for me is he throw a wind
19:30 negative pressure that's all it is
19:32 exactly like water holding a bubble
19:35 together is exactly it's holding all of
19:37 us down to this the surface of this
19:40 place we are right and at no point does
19:43 that wobble right we don't have a Mary
19:46 Poppins morning where we all sudden
19:48 start floating around our living room
19:50 because that yeah yeah yeah I just got
19:52 kind of bored of holding it all together
19:54 or the laws of physics that would hold
19:58 down well would make ether all winds act
20:02 just like water around a bubble they
20:05 just didn't want to work that thing nope
20:07 everything works all the time it's an
20:08 absolute thing okay keep that in mind
20:14 karma as defined is always rooted back
20:18 to the fabric of the universe on an
20:20 emotional spiritual level something's
20:24 keeping track
20:25 it has a book of the do's and the don'ts
20:28 and when you cross those lines it
20:31 immediately has a Big Brother eye on you
20:33 and dings your little you know driver's
20:37 license with a point you know infraction
20:41 point but we don't see it happening you
20:43 know and then eventually you know it
20:44 swells up to a point where a big you
20:47 know plasma lightning bolt hits you and
20:50 you you get something really negative in
20:53 your life right we all know of people
20:56 whether they be fixture well not
20:58 fictional but I mean we know folks that
21:00 are outside of our circle that are on TV
21:02 a Ted Bundy or something like that that
21:04 gets away with goddamn murder forever no
21:07 he got put to death in 89 thank God but
21:11 man he got to live a swell life didn't
21:13 he him getting the electric chair do you
21:15 really think that is an even swap for
21:20 all of the stuff that he did he killed
21:21 over 30 people
21:22 he claimed over 100 to one of the cops
21:25 but at the end he did confess to I think
21:28 30 six people or something like that
21:30 like six different states all right
21:36 one guy fries in a chair he was an
21:40 escapee of prison so who knows if they
21:42 put him in prison he might have become
21:43 some playboy or something right but he
21:47 did kill a twelve-year-old so just tell
21:50 all the guys on the on the playground
21:52 that Ted Bundy here and he gets about
21:55 this time of day
21:56 you know Dahmer got his in the back of a
22:01 prison and the fact that Dahmer was
22:03 killed by a kid it was clinically
22:07 mentally [ __ ] it was just amazing
22:10 and I say that in a very revering way
22:13 that even a kid with limited faculties
22:16 just knew this guy was bad right and
22:20 maybe that's not the true story about
22:21 how he passed away but I saw this
22:23 interview I was expecting to see some
22:25 big giant badass guy rips heads off with
22:28 his forearms no it's like an average guy
22:32 you said I heard that he did this and
22:35 those people have what's coming so if
22:38 karma exists
22:39 on this planet I would say that it is
22:41 man governing man making those choices
22:47 now I used to say that's why I cut
22:49 myself off further I used to say that
22:51 karma always comes around but never when
22:55 you expect it not when you want it to
22:58 happen right someone immediately does
23:00 something bad to you you want something
23:02 immediately bad to happen back to them
23:05 and again this thing that's happening to
23:08 you might be the best thing that's ever
23:09 happened to you
23:10 right when I given it I give you another
23:13 example which again hardcore folks will
23:17 be repeat real quick but I know that I
23:20 say what I'm saying to be a little bit
23:23 okay with the fact that I just got
23:26 screwed somehow right I helped a company
23:28 when I came down here to Huntington
23:31 Beach it was a about a three-man team
23:33 one woman and two guys run by one dude
23:36 and he was a shyster if there ever was
23:40 one I mean goddamn I mean he's the
23:42 sleazeball of [ __ ] sleaze balls at
23:44 the time you may be a wonderful man
23:46 today but back in the day he was a
23:48 pathological [ __ ] liar unbelievable
23:51 narcissist to [ __ ] the highest degree
23:53 of any human being on planet earth and I
23:56 didn't completely pick it up and when
23:58 you work in the game industry you do
23:59 bump into a bunch of kind of awkward
24:01 people and so you think all right well
24:03 he's just Kyle's weird [ __ ] things
24:05 about him but when it came to business
24:07 is when he knew what he was doing you
24:09 know how to steal money he knew how to
24:12 lie to clients and I mean big lies right
24:15 well I had gotten him the biggest
24:17 project his company had ever had it's
24:21 what I do
24:22 no sooner does the facts come in with
24:25 the signed contract he is supposed to
24:27 produce a big giant lump of code that he
24:32 kept saying I have it's right here on
24:33 this drive I have it I have it and I
24:35 said okay well you know ship it over or
24:36 make it available to me whatever he goes
24:38 there's no code there's no nothing and
24:41 I'm sitting there going I bid on the
24:43 [ __ ] project you said that part of
24:44 the platform was done we're doing this
24:46 very quickly so I should have demanded
24:49 to see it again I trusted boom got bit
24:53 long story short our relationship fell
24:55 apart fairly quickly we exposed him to
25:01 our friends who were the clients I don't
25:05 think he ever recovered in that industry
25:06 bumped into him 10 years later he's
25:08 doing something completely unrelated to
25:10 games but here's what happened
25:13 I bumped out of his company with again
25:16 one of my colleagues from Electronic
25:18 Arts actually two of them but I created
25:21 a video game company with one of them
25:23 and here we are sitting in the living
25:25 room of the house that I'm at right now
25:27 wondering how we're gonna pay all of our
25:30 bills we had a couple gigs that were
25:32 paying the bills but it was slam baby
25:34 and within a year and a half we were
25:37 depositing you know half a million
25:40 dollars a month so okay hmm should I
25:46 worry about the karma that that guy gets
25:49 not really because the benefit of him
25:53 screwing up the company in making me
25:56 want to move out of his company formed
25:58 my company and of course I run
26:01 everything right I treat people
26:03 correctly I never lie
26:05 and so everyone finds a home and it
26:07 works right if it weren't for 2008
26:11 subprime loan scandal slice inside
26:14 inside job by our bilderberg banker
26:18 friends I'd be sitting on a powder keg
26:21 right now probably a karma I think what
26:27 karma runs into is people simply say I
26:29 need a model of karma that works for me
26:31 right now
26:31 I want someone to suffer right now why
26:34 because I'm suffering right now how many
26:38 times have you gotten yourself extremely
26:40 upset about something and then you
26:42 inadvertently or intentionally count to
26:44 10
26:44 either 10 seconds passes by which is not
26:47 literal but a day or a week or a month
26:50 passes by there's nothing you can do
26:52 about it you kind of look back on it and
26:54 you're like okay it wasn't as bad as I
26:59 thought it was I mean I was really upset
27:01 and I was very terrified after something
27:03 happened you know usually when we lose
27:05 our
27:05 that that's a point of massive anxiety
27:08 sometimes but the reason why I believe
27:12 there are so many spin-offs of karma is
27:14 because that's what we need right
27:18 there's a great Twilight Zone episode
27:20 called what you need and it's about an
27:25 old man who has one of these suitcases
27:27 with all the kind of knickknacks you'd
27:28 ever want a pair of socks a button some
27:31 stain remover pair of shoes pair of
27:35 scissors an ink pen this is 1960-61
27:42 somewhere in there and he just sells
27:46 knickknacks and but every once in a
27:48 while someone will turn him down and he
27:51 looks at them and he's got this gift and
27:53 there's something that that person's
27:55 gonna need in the next 10 to 15 minutes
27:57 of their life and so he finds it and he
28:00 gives it to them at no cost and he says
28:04 here I want you to have this and they
28:07 say oh why would I ever need that and
28:10 he's he just says this is what you need
28:12 and sure enough within 10 minutes he
28:16 gave one guy a bus ticket and the guy
28:18 was a washed-up baseball player with a
28:20 bad elbow and all of a sudden he gets a
28:23 phone call at the at the booth at the
28:26 phone booth and he goes in there and
28:28 finds that he's got a new coaching job
28:30 in some other state and the ticket he
28:34 was given is to that state and the guy's
28:37 like oh my god what are the odds that I
28:38 just got this ticket given to me and I
28:40 need to go there
28:41 and I don't have any money but he also
28:43 gave another young lady some stain
28:45 remover she's like why don't I need
28:48 stain remover before I don't he stains
28:49 um he goes I don't know it's what you
28:50 need well she's got the hots for the
28:53 baseball guy and the baseball guy is
28:55 like oh my god I have a job interview
28:56 and you know my suits not it's not fresh
28:59 enough and I got this big spot on my
29:01 suit so she gets up and says well I
29:05 might have something that will help with
29:07 that and of course there google GOOG I
29:09 donno a sudden she was she sought the
29:12 spot another off to the races
29:15 karma is trying to provide what you need
29:18 in that situation I need revenge
29:22 I need justice I need to know that
29:24 someone who has done something bad to me
29:26 is not going to be able to do something
29:28 bad to someone else hmm
29:30 I would wager that the Internet itself
29:33 has changed karma and accountability and
29:36 the ability for predators to continue
29:39 being predators like nothing we've ever
29:41 seen in history I think I mentioned in
29:44 one episode before but imagine someone
29:45 is a serial I don't want to say date
29:51 rapist because that's illegal to the
29:53 nines and that will be something that
29:55 you know the person should be put in
29:57 prison for but something lighter than
29:59 that something almost that bad there's
30:01 just a womanizer
30:03 there a maneater whatever some guy who's
30:07 selling used cars down the street and
30:10 he's lying everyone someone who abuses
30:12 the car as soon as it goes in for
30:14 repairs you have to be back soon to get
30:16 to pay for changes today that
30:19 information gets put online doesn't it
30:22 reputations go all around the world in a
30:25 couple seconds sometimes it gets film
30:28 sometimes it's just you posted on
30:30 Facebook I am getting divorced because
30:34 my ex-husband or ex-wife cheated on me
30:37 with five people this person this person
30:40 this person this buddy gave me tagged
30:41 those people right they could put
30:43 photographs online of you know
30:46 photographs of them doing this as long
30:48 as it's a public place right it changes
30:51 everything
30:52 so there's the revenge karma which is
30:55 you're trying to get back at someone
30:57 else which is the most common practice
31:00 of me being sort of engaged in the
31:04 conversation in public then there's the
31:08 self Karma system and this is where we
31:10 want a lot of lenience because it's us
31:12 hmm
31:14 well now think about this there's a lot
31:19 of ideas about why we have been created
31:22 a lot of times the question comes from
31:24 well God was lonely and he wanted people
31:26 to be around all right
31:28 well that's the case where is he right
31:31 when he
31:31 to come down as a what's going on in now
31:34 I'm not gonna tell you what's gonna the
31:35 lotto numbers tomorrow and I'm not gonna
31:37 tell you whether or not you're being
31:39 good or bad I just wanted to say hi cuz
31:41 i'm pretty lonely and the prince would
31:42 have song
31:43 would have got is one of us which makes
31:45 us all think about it right but then we
31:47 have this idea that we are thinking 24/7
31:52 at least we are on the show and we don't
31:56 want to be you know making mistakes but
32:00 we are created compared to an infinitely
32:03 perfect being we consider ourselves to
32:05 be flawed many of you know that my
32:08 belief system is is that the greatest
32:10 gift that God ever gave us was being
32:12 flawed the greatest gift we have given
32:15 ourselves or God has given us is that
32:17 when we are born we largely forget who
32:19 we were before at least for the time
32:21 being while in this meat popsicle that
32:24 we are right why would you want to be
32:26 hunted by a previous life and why would
32:29 you want to open that artery up so that
32:30 you can't live the one that you're stuck
32:32 in what you do with his life well I
32:34 spent the whole life live in the other
32:35 life we're trying to figure out what it
32:37 was really why I mean you're gonna do
32:40 this over and over and over and over
32:41 you're gonna really waste all of your
32:43 lives looking backwards at other lives
32:45 hmm I mean it's it's anecdotally very
32:50 interesting if you believe that your
32:52 behaviors today are plagued by your past
32:54 then perhaps you believe in karma you
32:58 believe you've sown a thread you're
33:01 reaping it now
33:03 well if you're supposed to accomplish
33:05 something in this world if that is
33:07 indeed any part of the charter of our
33:09 condition and you would think that that
33:11 has something to do with it because
33:13 otherwise God just wants a bunch of bean
33:15 stocks to grow up and call themselves
33:17 human what do you do will you just stand
33:20 here and we're beans oh that's great
33:23 I'm sure glad I worked on your brain so
33:27 you could never use it
33:28 it'd be like sitting in a car a race car
33:31 on a track what are you doing I'm in my
33:33 car well are you gonna race I'm in my
33:38 car okay take care now bye bye then I'm
33:41 in my car right that's not life life is
33:45 about
33:45 getting out there hauling some ass
33:48 trying things that you've never tried
33:50 try not to hurt anyone trying to hurt
33:52 yourself but take it to the limit baby
33:54 and just because you have taken it to
33:56 the limit in the past doesn't mean
33:57 you're done all right now of course I'm
34:00 not talking to necessarily a 75 year old
34:03 person or above perhaps they have earned
34:06 a nice level of relaxation after 75
34:09 years of you know balls-to-the-wall life
34:12 living right but I think the numbers
34:15 pretty high these days health is pretty
34:17 good long as you don't eat shitty GMOs
34:20 take vaccinations and brush with
34:22 fluoride you'll have a chance what do
34:25 you tell a kid when they are trying to
34:29 do something perhaps they're trying to
34:30 run a 440 lap and they fall down and
34:36 you're their parent and you look at them
34:39 and they're healthy but you see them
34:41 lose their constitution their will to
34:43 race and they're having a problem maybe
34:46 they're jumping hurdles maybe it's not
34:47 just running and if your kid were to
34:51 stop and walk off the course before they
34:53 finish without any sort of like major
34:56 ankle breakage or something like that
34:58 wouldn't you be disappointed as a parent
35:01 white give enough kid get back out there
35:03 this is exactly how life works it kicks
35:06 you in the balls it makes you double
35:08 over and make sure you lose all the the
35:10 air you have in your chest but as long
35:13 as you just chill out relax you'll get
35:14 it all back right it's the way it works
35:20 hmm but we need a guidance system right
35:23 we need something that keeps the human
35:25 condition from eating itself up we need
35:27 something out there that prevents this
35:31 world for turning into law of the jungle
35:33 right religion I think is one of the
35:36 most masterful things we've ever created
35:38 because it was the first time that
35:40 anyone wrote down morality and without
35:44 morality you have no right or wrong up
35:45 without right or wrong you have no karma
35:48 karma may have been one of the very
35:50 first action reaction models that the
35:54 world used before highly developed you
35:57 know Christianity
35:59 and all the other religions of its kind
36:01 right I make mistakes I say things I
36:06 shouldn't say sometimes I'm trying to be
36:08 funny and I say something crude and
36:11 everyone doesn't laugh right they just
36:14 sit there and I oh my god did you just
36:16 say that I'm think sorry the other time
36:18 I'll say something just as crude if not
36:20 more crude everyone laughs and so I go
36:24 [ __ ] I guess a comedian which I am NOT
36:27 but you know I try to do my own little
36:30 riffing jokes but a comedian must do
36:32 this all the time throw out a joke it
36:35 doesn't work tell another one it works
36:38 okay that's the process right well we
36:40 try things in life and we fail we try
36:42 things in life and we succeed karma is
36:47 when those attempts are either conniving
36:52 ly based on what we would you know
36:57 categorize as a moral infraction I
37:00 wanted money so I sold your TV I wanted
37:04 money so I stole [ __ ] out of your wallet
37:06 I stole a car I wanted a partner for
37:10 life so I stole your girlfriend
37:12 right little tiny crimes we don't even
37:15 really think about them within the Karma
37:17 bubble we think about them as the
37:18 egregious crimes the ones that are
37:20 unforgivable and you're sitting there
37:23 staring up at night when you're young
37:24 God you know how can you let this person
37:27 get away with this if there is karma of
37:30 any kind I would say it is it is only
37:34 something that is accessible if the
37:36 human being engaging in the crime truly
37:40 feels guilty for what they're doing
37:42 there are politicians and bankers who
37:46 make an art to raise their children
37:48 without empathy there are certain races
37:53 on this planet that culturally do not
37:56 raise themselves with any empathy they
38:01 just execute like a machine all right
38:04 that's the way they do it I don't know
38:07 if they believe in karma
38:08 they don't have empathy so how would
38:11 they ever have Karma
38:12 right was a gorilla po po wrote about
38:16 the heartbeat a man kills a woman and
38:19 hides her body underneath the
38:21 floorboards and in his paranoid mind of
38:25 morality he hears the scratching hears
38:30 the heartbeat and he thinks he's buried
38:32 this person alive and he and people come
38:34 over and he's like can't you hear that
38:36 you know can't you hear that suffering
38:39 and no one can hear anything because
38:40 that person's dead but in his mind his
38:43 subconscious ate him alive he developed
38:46 his own Karma his own checks and
38:48 balances within himself
38:50 there are several rituals throughout the
38:53 world where people of various religions
38:55 punish themselves routinely because they
38:58 know they're sinners see this portrayed
39:00 in a lot of different Clips the funniest
39:03 one is the the one in a quest for the
39:05 Holy Grail by Monty Python where the
39:07 preachers are chanting this Latin and
39:09 then they pound themselves in the face
39:10 with the board as a real activity then
39:14 you have the cultures that whip
39:16 themselves with whips with barbed steel
39:19 on them and they bleed all over they
39:22 walk down the street thousands of them
39:23 do this and they're smacking themselves
39:25 this was in HBO's carnival I believe it
39:29 was in Norwalk Empire do dudes that
39:35 would routinely whip themselves brother
39:37 Justin used to whip himself from
39:39 carnival and the tax guy who was the bad
39:41 dude and one of the Marvel movies did it
39:43 too so they inflicted upon themselves
39:46 their own localized punishment system to
39:49 probably avoid any Karma down the line I
39:52 will punish myself for my violations of
39:55 humanity so you don't have to so I don't
39:58 have to worry about what's going to
40:00 happen to me afterwards hmm so man has
40:05 been trying to deal with this for a very
40:06 long time and it's very interesting to
40:08 me that morality is something that
40:10 probably is impossible to orchestrate
40:14 within a chemical bag that we call the
40:17 brain it is something existential it is
40:20 something outside of us that is
40:22 something abstract like love morality of
40:25 something is very
40:27 well if you have any it motivates you to
40:31 the absolute extremes of your being and
40:35 as is non empathetic as a culture might
40:38 be there's always a threshold well they
40:41 will do street justice and sometimes
40:45 Street justice goes insane because the
40:47 culture or sorry that local region that
40:50 they're living in is so horrible there's
40:52 so much pain in all the people four
40:54 completely different proprietary reasons
40:56 that when someone gets caught being a
40:58 thief it's like that scene in Holy Grail
41:00 where they try to hang the beautiful
41:02 woman for being a witch it's because
41:05 they hated themselves but they want to
41:07 kill the witch there's at least
41:09 someone's getting some pain but let's
41:12 talk about determinism as a result of
41:15 karma because when we cancel out the
41:18 other or one would at least the negate
41:20 the existence of the other determinism
41:24 is entertained on a I would say
41:30 subatomic quantum physics level and is
41:36 entertained on the well I would say
41:39 inside the religious paradigms that are
41:41 out there in the world has God written
41:42 everything down for you those of you who
41:46 study time and one of the commenters
41:48 just made this comment and I do not
41:49 believe that person had seen my episode
41:51 on time where I was in total agreeance
41:54 with this commoner some of us see time
41:57 as an illusion we are in the infinite
42:00 now constantly and as I envisioned it as
42:04 a young kid it's a cube of well it's a
42:08 shape of points infinite points you know
42:13 you can count up as far as you want you
42:14 can count down as far as you want
42:15 negatively and you can go divisible
42:17 divisible right as much as you want
42:20 alright so time should have that
42:23 principle kind of freak you for the
42:27 brain to think about right the Infinity
42:29 project right all right so what if you
42:34 were just a consciousness falling
42:35 through this apparatus of ether winds
42:38 that is this particular
42:40 and you manifest into a human being you
42:44 live this proprietary life in this ball
42:46 or flatter disk or wherever the hell you
42:49 are simulation your running program e 20
42:52 nine right and you're this particular
42:55 person at that particular place at this
42:57 particular time and you're just falling
42:59 through time it's the next moment it's
43:03 the next moment it's the next moment
43:04 well if you were in such a container of
43:09 these eventualities and every
43:12 eventualities it can physically occur is
43:15 occurring now something can occur it's
43:17 on in the system any system that exists
43:21 would have to have rules of some sort
43:23 you just do and so we're we're
43:26 determinism fall into that well you
43:28 could calculate your trajectory through
43:31 wherever you are ah but wait a minute
43:35 maybe maybe there's an added extra layer
43:38 of steering-wheel in the system there's
43:42 an accelerator and there's a brake
43:44 there's even emergency brake case you
43:46 want to do all those cool turnarounds
43:48 right and go to Bao face I'm losing his
43:49 [ __ ] weight all right even though
43:53 theoretically speaking and this was in
43:55 the book chaos a long time ago in the
43:58 80s was like I think I was the guy's
44:02 name you know he made a point that a lot
44:06 of people knew at the time which is if
44:07 you could calculate all the particles in
44:10 this container called
44:13 Earth and if you had no outside
44:15 participation from space then you could
44:18 determine the weather perfectly in every
44:21 single region of the world how many
44:22 drops fall out of the sky could be in a
44:25 computer hmm but we automatically hear
44:30 that and we think oh it's never gonna
44:32 happen well if one of us can hack the
44:35 bean matrix maybe we could figure that
44:37 out not that anyone would want to know
44:40 once you hand over the the results right
44:42 we got an app for that
44:44 but determinism is really sort of a
44:47 proprietary thought of well all right
44:50 well yeah sure on some scientific level
44:53 yeah you could predict everything if you
44:55 knew everything but the nice thing is
44:57 mankind can't figure out everything
44:59 because we have a limited capacity to
45:01 hold any one concept in our mind
45:04 remember you and I try to teach people
45:08 about computers like older folks or
45:10 really young kids and they're trying to
45:12 figure out what is the hard drive what
45:14 is memory and all that kind of stuff
45:15 what's a processor and I just say it's
45:17 just like the human body I said you know
45:21 how you can remember like I'm talking to
45:22 someone over 60 it's really fun because
45:24 you just remember when you were 8 and
45:25 you ate your first I was sorry maybe you
45:28 remember when the first time you ever
45:30 ate ice cream or something like that and
45:31 your best ice cream and you see them
45:33 think for a second right and they're
45:35 pulling back their robotic arms are
45:37 going back into the data tapes and
45:38 pulling an ice cream first their arm and
45:40 then they can remember it I said well
45:42 that long-term storage is your hard
45:44 drive what you've done is you've loaded
45:46 it into your short-term memory that way
45:48 we're having a conversation about it but
45:50 you're only able to process the thought
45:52 because you have a processor there you
45:55 go for each one of your senses in your
45:58 body you've got a processor you get a
45:59 sound processor you got a video card for
46:02 your eyeballs you have your brain which
46:04 is just taking in all everything and
46:06 pushing it it together into an image
46:08 that is you if everything is determined
46:10 then all of your sins all of your
46:12 immorality would be determined as well
46:15 well again the paradox becomes it's hard
46:19 to hang on to karma when you can see
46:22 that mathematically on paper you could
46:24 prove theoretically speaking that you
46:27 could determine everything that was
46:28 going to occur but God threw in this
46:32 little wild card called consciousness
46:34 right sometimes you see karma come back
46:37 right right away somebody does something
46:40 and they immediately pay the price okay
46:44 here's what's interesting about this
46:46 conversation let's a vision a tabletop
46:50 and we're all around it
46:51 the deep thought is right and we put
46:56 karma on the table and then we put
46:58 determinism on the table and then we put
47:01 consciousness and then maybe we put
47:04 reality as we perceive it
47:07 through a full matter energy electrons
47:11 every single distinguishing Sigma 5
47:15 orbital categorization of ether
47:19 everything now the consciousness is over
47:23 here it's the one that's your soul your
47:26 spirit and you got to figure out a model
47:28 to push all these things together karma
47:32 is sticking out like a sore thumb
47:34 because it is simply the will of man to
47:38 have a circle of punishment for the
47:42 individual sins that an individual might
47:45 conduct by themselves or against others
47:48 the sins you can conduct by yourself
47:50 will be that of the mind I'm thinking
47:53 about thought towards someone else but I
47:54 haven't actually done anything so the
47:56 next day jeez you could you could be
48:01 really nice to that person and they
48:02 would never know they are sitting out
48:03 there telling everybody this person is
48:06 my best friend but in your brain hell
48:08 you could be thinking bad thoughts I
48:09 don't even know if I can trust that
48:11 person or whatever you know my concern
48:14 about karma and living by it is that it
48:18 is a distraction it's a distraction for
48:22 you to live for the judgment of others
48:28 if you were in some weird prison you
48:31 went down to South America and you got
48:33 captured and you know you're in some
48:35 prison it's average degrees 110 in this
48:38 sweatbox or whatever the first thing you
48:42 need to do is survive and escape right
48:45 you need to get the hell out of this
48:47 place whether or not the guards we're
48:49 simply doing their job maybe they're
48:51 participating directly in your suffering
48:53 maybe that the reason why you got caught
48:56 whether they get punished or not well
48:58 that's something gonna think about after
49:00 you get to a better place right now you
49:03 need to survive and you need to escape
49:04 right I think it was Will Smith who I
49:10 believe is a Scientologist and you know
49:12 they they have a lot of mechanisms
49:13 within that system of belief to help you
49:17 live your life there's a bunch of them
49:19 right Christian
49:20 he's one of them Judaism's one of them
49:21 there's other schools of thought Tony
49:23 Robbins he made a point that I I'm going
49:27 to butcher with a paraphrase but it was
49:29 essentially something like it was based
49:31 on karma it was based on revenge and it
49:33 was something to the effect of [ __ ]
49:37 happens men and you can't worry about
49:40 going backwards to pass out the
49:42 punishment slip you got to pick yourself
49:46 up because no one's going to live your
49:49 life but you and that's it and that's
49:52 the god-honest truth man the other thing
49:56 that I've noticed is that for folks that
49:57 really really preach karma and for
50:01 telling you that means they think about
50:02 it probably 10 times as much as they are
50:04 willing to discuss it with you in their
50:05 personal time I have not known someone
50:08 who talks about Karma that seems to be a
50:11 kind of person I want to spend a lot of
50:12 time with they seem acidic in their
50:15 alkaline nature they're always sort of
50:18 that I don't know it's sort of like a
50:21 dagger with some poison on it and even
50:24 though they're not trying to stick you
50:27 with it necessarily and they're living
50:28 for a good cause or like man I just want
50:30 bad people to get what they deserve well
50:34 what time does that leave for them to
50:35 live their life and then the idea is
50:39 there they've heightened their awareness
50:41 for what they define as being a victim
50:45 right one of the saddest things about
50:48 the 21st century is there's your
50:50 Democratic Party in the United States of
50:52 America which means all the press all
50:56 the institutions of education most most
51:01 of the time they have taught the world
51:04 to be such a victim but I think the rise
51:08 of karma even though it might be going
51:10 by a different name is off the charts
51:12 and the problem with this over
51:14 victimization of society meaning the
51:18 slightest [ __ ] thing happens to you
51:19 and you're just trying to you know paint
51:23 as sizing in another protest going the
51:26 problem is is that we actually have real
51:28 victims in this world that need help and
51:31 for people to
51:33 use victimization as a method of
51:35 controlling politics either controlling
51:39 the laws that are passed by drumming up
51:41 a bunch of crazy dissent against
51:44 something you know like a rare thing
51:46 that happens portraying as if it happens
51:49 every day it cuts down on the people
51:54 that are actually having it happen as a
51:55 rare occasion they're using the the
52:01 accusation of either a date rape or some
52:06 sort of sexual advancement that wasn't
52:08 permitted by word they're lying about
52:12 these events and creating them right our
52:15 president has been accused of so many
52:17 things that the second he says let's go
52:19 into court bring your evidence put it in
52:21 discovery let's find out who you are all
52:24 of them cave because there is a false
52:26 accusation it's just to get in the press
52:28 to make a person look bad and as soon as
52:30 they go into court they become a
52:32 perjured witness against themselves
52:35 because they don't have the evidence
52:37 right what about the girl that did get
52:41 date raped she is then trying to get her
52:45 case to go in there because the Society
52:47 has seen so many lies and fakes now she
52:52 looks like the kid who called wolf right
52:54 but she needs support the beautiful
52:58 thing about the little hometown I grew
53:00 up in and it was a it's still a great
53:01 town but I mean when I was a kid you
53:05 would learn about things that happen
53:07 between people and again I don't know of
53:08 anything major horrific things that
53:10 happened in my hometown by any major I
53:13 don't think those things occurred at
53:15 least that anyone found out right but
53:19 you would just hear that things happen
53:21 and people got hurt their feelings got
53:23 hurt
53:24 very seldom to anyone physically get
53:26 hurt but they sucked it up they used
53:29 that moment as a moment to become
53:32 stronger and they did and they became
53:36 wise to how the world works and such
53:39 they could pass it down to their
53:40 relatives or their friends to say we'll
53:42 watch out if this happens this other
53:44 thing might be happening instead of what
53:45 you think
53:46 so be careful honey right the thing is
53:50 this this is what I sort of find out is
53:52 find to be the truth more often than not
53:55 in my own personal life a person who is
53:59 committing some sort of moral infraction
54:03 to get ahead they step on people to get
54:06 ahead that's usually the easiest
54:08 definition they're not very smart right
54:14 their hubris tends to grow each and
54:17 every time that they successfully step
54:19 on someone's head to get ahead and the
54:21 beautiful balance of nature is not some
54:23 invisible force called karma is it is
54:27 that a stupid person which is what this
54:29 person is will always sabotage their
54:33 life in the end now the one thing we can
54:38 hand down to politicians that have sold
54:43 out their country betrayed their people
54:47 as even just the whole world not just
54:49 their state or district or their in
54:53 their nation that they came from is to
54:56 remember them in the history books for
54:58 exactly who they were and to dig out
55:00 everything that they ever did and it's
55:02 important that if we don't want to
55:03 commit a moral infraction we've got to
55:06 really check what we think is true but
55:08 once you find it to be true let's make
55:11 sure that that crime of their behavior
55:14 is used as an example within their name
55:17 now the boy who call wolf tail now I'm
55:22 willing to bet at some point in real
55:25 history something like that occurred and
55:27 so they created the parable to teach us
55:30 for the rest of life don't do this
55:32 okay because you know when a wolf is out
55:34 there eating up all of our sheep or
55:38 whatever we need to know and if you lie
55:39 about it all the time then you're not
55:41 going to be the guy we're ever gonna
55:42 listen to which means you got to go find
55:43 out the job and if you cause a problem
55:47 with the fact that you're a liar to get
55:49 attention then we may kick you out of
55:51 the tribe and you can just go Finn for
55:53 yourself out there in the woods with all
55:55 the wolf's right but we see it all the
55:58 time right we see ignorant people
56:00 ignorant politicians who think they're
56:02 smarter than you and what usually what
56:04 it is is like 20 years ago they hit
56:06 their peak and all their methods of
56:08 deception were throwing us off for loop
56:13 we're all falling for it and eventually
56:15 we got to see what could not be unseen
56:17 and then we started to see the crime
56:20 started to understand it maybe we even
56:23 became a victim of it which was
56:25 unthinkable until life kept going right
56:30 we have services like Yelp we have
56:34 reviews on things we didn't have reviews
56:36 before right someone creates a crappy
56:39 movie but they've played a really good
56:41 trailer like soullow and everyone goes
56:44 and sees the movie because the trailer
56:45 convinced them that the movie was gonna
56:48 be worthwhile and then you see and you
56:50 realize it's a big lump of crap and you
56:52 start tapping away writing a review on
56:55 it all right
56:57 then no one goes and sees it the movie
56:59 bombs and Disney goes who made this
57:02 again oh yeah all right well you're not
57:04 making any more movies I'm not gonna
57:06 work here anymore by the way who else is
57:09 working on something here because we got
57:10 to make sure this never happens again
57:12 if a restaurant serves food that gives
57:15 you food poisoning you can go right up
57:16 on Yelp and say I just puked my guts out
57:18 for eight hours I'm in the hospital and
57:23 it's because of that restaurant we have
57:27 checks and balances now like we've never
57:28 had in the past individuals well we got
57:33 that stupid app that's becoming a
57:36 reality in China we got to be really
57:38 careful with that old rating thing right
57:40 everyone's swiping up and down whether
57:42 or not left or right that you're a good
57:44 person or a bad person based on the
57:45 current temperature of lunacy but now
57:49 what if we we all got into karma we just
57:53 made karma calm and it's just a bunch of
57:55 names of people that should just get
57:56 screwed over then people start lying
57:59 about you things you never did the
58:01 mistaken identity John Smith and San
58:04 Francisco is a pedophile oh [ __ ] well
58:09 then there's a bunch of John Smith's are
58:10 gonna get that label for no reason some
58:13 guy even thinks he's looked at up
58:14 guy where he lives and he's got the
58:15 wrong dude hmm or that a scum zout the
58:19 app that is wired to the rights of your
58:21 country like in China they are planning
58:26 by 2020 to enforce the results of a
58:30 opinion app about human beings to human
58:33 beings just like black mirror okay
58:35 there's also Orville episode that ripped
58:38 out black mirror but they're gonna start
58:41 removing your rights to do things in the
58:44 country maybe even leave the country if
58:47 you get really really bad
58:48 don't be able to buy food who knows it's
58:51 all up for grabs but that would be
58:54 because we don't want to live our lives
58:56 we want to live other people's lives we
58:58 want to be the the Wraith of that haunts
59:03 someone right now I want to make a
59:05 distinction I probably should have made
59:07 it early but I haven't gone deep into
59:09 this sort sort of category until just
59:11 now but I am not talking about people
59:14 that commit crimes that are in the books
59:18 that we have today right someone who's
59:20 murdered a child or something oh yeah we
59:23 need to take those people out sorry
59:26 sorry no rehabilitation for you there
59:29 are things that need to be punished
59:31 there are things that we do as citizens
59:34 that require we be pulled out of society
59:36 for a while we've got it measured we've
59:40 got you know a number of years you spent
59:43 in prison for a particular crime now I
59:47 do think it is utterly [ __ ] crazy
59:49 that a lot of our crimes are on state
59:52 levels right marijuana being legal in
59:55 one state and not legal and the other
59:57 abortion having various rules in one
59:59 state versus another come on people we
60:03 are now at least aware due to the
60:07 Internet of what's going on and I don't
60:11 think that in one state you can have sex
60:14 with a thirteen-year-old when you're 45
60:15 and it's legal and the other state if
60:18 she's one day before 18 you go to jail
60:20 forever and you're a predator and you
60:23 have to you know we need to figure out
60:24 what we agree on and lock it into place
60:27 with
60:28 these things that have been at the state
60:29 level not probably not even a bunch but
60:32 just a few
60:34 do I believe karma really exists hmm
60:38 no not as a supernatural force that God
60:42 has put in place I don't I think that
60:47 individuals who feel guilt will
60:49 typically self-sabotage and cause a car
60:51 Matic moment to occur but I think that
60:55 if you're Yago from Othello there's no
60:57 penalty you will ever have your Clinton
60:59 and you operate every single day with a
61:02 rationale for everything that you've
61:04 done right these celebrities and rich
61:10 people that consume adrenal chromes from
61:14 children to stay young if you can do
61:18 that you don't have any empathy you
61:20 don't have any morals and you don't
61:23 belong on this [ __ ] plane of
61:25 existence with the rest of us
61:27 and there goes for all the people that
61:29 facilitate such a thing the peasants who
61:33 couldn't afford a drop of this stuff
61:34 right now it's just a exiting footnote
61:40 to this episode I will say this because
61:44 I think we need a a big-picture
61:45 perspective of what's about to come on
61:48 this planet we know that there are
61:53 forces out there that are exposing
61:56 crimes that man can barely physically or
62:00 mentally conceive of things that you
62:03 thought were impossible to occur and
62:05 especially by the people that have been
62:06 accused and again we need to be careful
62:09 about who we believe about everyone I
62:11 don't like certain people a lot but I'm
62:14 going to hold out for more evidence
62:17 before I fully convict my own chest that
62:20 they are guilty of something right got
62:22 to be real careful with that but there
62:26 is going to be if we succeed in getting
62:29 rid of the deep state which looks like
62:30 an inevitable step believe me without a
62:35 massive human clearing on this planet
62:38 they are going to simply reform
62:41 rhe congregate and come back even
62:45 stronger so the cleanup has to be
62:48 extremely efficient but we don't want
62:49 some crazy-ass Inquisition cleanup we
62:51 don't want some crazy-ass you know I
62:55 guess Inquisition is good enough but we
62:57 don't want this thing where we're
62:58 running around with mob mentality
63:01 hurting people without due process and
63:05 evidence and you know proof that these
63:10 people have done what they were accused
63:12 of rape if you were to be an absolutist
63:16 with karma then you might just you know
63:21 brush off your hands and say well I
63:23 don't need to do anything because the
63:25 universe is gonna take care of them and
63:28 I would agree with you on one level that
63:31 when you pass everything that you've
63:32 done the hell that you've created on
63:34 earth will follow you because you will
63:36 realize what you've done and the most
63:38 three-dimensional amazing format that
63:40 you've ever seen in your life it'll be
63:42 the most HD video you've ever seen okay
63:45 your crimes on humanity there's that
63:47 funny ass movie where that guy goes to
63:49 he dies he gets hit by a bus he goes to
63:52 heaven he sort of goes to purgatory and
63:53 he's being evaluated it's whole ice
63:55 being evaluated and it just turns out
63:56 he's kind of an [ __ ] who's got to
63:58 come back down to earth and help people
64:00 it's an old old tale it's been told
64:03 several times but he falls in love with
64:05 a girl up there who has a glorious life
64:09 and he wants to go with her he wants to
64:11 follow her but his record sucks his
64:13 report cards a bunch of F's she's got
64:16 three days so he has an extra motive to
64:20 get this thing right so he can follow
64:21 this girl such a brilliant little spin
64:23 on the script there is a definition of
64:28 Karma that I like and I think it's one
64:30 that we can hang on to which is the
64:33 externalized karma of what you do to
64:34 other people how you help others right
64:39 one of the reasons why I like doing this
64:41 show and teaching and helping anyone do
64:44 anything Network the right person to get
64:47 them from you know second guessing their
64:49 capabilities to believing in their
64:51 capabilities so I think better than that
64:53 such an amazing reward
64:55 and and there's no need for any credit
64:59 for it
65:00 right you just do it because it's what
65:02 we should do as human beings right I
65:04 like creating this show and I like
65:06 touching any one of you with any passage
65:09 I might say any one sentence that I say
65:11 that you guys remember even if I just
65:12 make you chuckle or laugh I've done my
65:15 job right but I'm a flawed human being
65:18 oh my god
65:20 I'm completely flawed I commit crimes in
65:24 my brain you know nothing horrendous but
65:26 I [ __ ] maybe they are [ __ ] I don't know
65:30 right but I try to live a life that I'm
65:33 proud of in the end you know I think any
65:37 of us that envision meeting our Creator
65:39 well you walk in that room and then you
65:42 know there's no question as to whether
65:44 or not your Creator would know your
65:45 whole life story they would and there's
65:48 that sort of I don't think there's any
65:51 Hell or damnation or anything like that
65:53 necessarily but you sit there in front
65:54 of your creator and you're like I'm
65:57 sorry man so I did that yeah but I did
65:59 this and that's pretty good right and
66:01 there's no report card at the end he's
66:03 not gonna go okay well you good door
66:04 number two instead of door number one
66:06 but why do I believe that is it my
66:09 [ __ ] way of getting getting sort
66:12 of to the ultimate destiny wherever we
66:14 go after this life you know I think I
66:16 come back as another being another human
66:21 maybe something else right I'm not gonna
66:25 worry about that until I'm there I
66:27 believe that if you were to take a a
66:31 dictator who has committed horrific
66:34 crimes
66:35 you know authorized the wholesale
66:38 slaughter of tens of millions of people
66:41 well obviously there's something
66:44 defective in their character that
66:46 they're doing this on earth I think
66:49 they're in Iago I don't think they're
66:51 doing anything wrong right because how
66:53 could you care right
66:55 how could you care I don't know mention
66:59 anyone dictator because there's too many
67:01 they can't pick on one because then it
67:02 would be almost a racist comment right
67:04 there's a bunch in every race some of
67:08 the nits
67:08 so egregiously we have videotapes of
67:10 this stuff happening and and pictures of
67:14 it happening other times it has been all
67:16 under the radar but you find out later
67:19 well and imagine that person has to go
67:22 to the other side and eventually face
67:24 down each person they have hurt again if
67:28 there's one soul boy that's just gonna
67:30 be some serious [ __ ] irony wouldn't
67:32 it
67:33 I believe we create our own hell on
67:35 earth we either create a world that is
67:39 highly rewarding and positive or we
67:43 create a world where we're living in
67:44 this negative I hate every person who's
67:47 ever hurt me and I can't think straight
67:48 so it's all about revenge revenge
67:51 revenge right that's not a very good
67:53 life I have found this one my closing
67:57 statements here but I have found the
67:58 sweetest people I have ever met have had
68:00 some of the toughest life's that any
68:02 human being could ever have right and
68:06 some of them are immigrants from other
68:08 countries countries that just have lost
68:11 complete control and this person was
68:13 like I would have loved to have stand up
68:16 and fought for my country but everyone
68:18 else is complicit to this craziness so I
68:21 had no choice but to get the hell out
68:23 cuz I'm the only person who's awake and
68:25 if I express that I'm awake I disappear
68:27 in the night
68:27 now it's when that country starts
68:29 providing tens of thousands if not
68:30 millions and millions of people that
68:33 start leaving the country then you're
68:34 kind of like yeah your story doesn't
68:35 really add up dude you got millions of
68:37 people who know their place is screwed
68:38 up and you don't need even a single
68:40 million to fight off an army to rate a
68:45 you know political white house of some
68:48 sort in your country or whatever right
68:50 one of the toughest things that we have
68:53 to accept in my opinion once you become
68:56 even marginally enlightened in this
68:58 world is to live for the now it's an
69:02 ass-kicker man that means you can't put
69:06 off anything you have to do it right now
69:08 and you do it until you literally get so
69:12 exhausted you have to go to bed why my
69:15 house is a complete [ __ ] so I
69:16 cleaned it and cleaned it and cleaned it
69:18 and it's like a five-day cleaning job
69:19 because I've been postponing this for
69:22 too
69:22 years I got dirt in every single corner
69:25 every single piece of clothing and
69:27 furnitures filthy cobwebs everywhere
69:29 it's gonna take you a long time to clean
69:31 up
69:31 but it's my analogy of the hatchet
69:34 against the big redwood tree even if you
69:37 take a little chunk out of it every day
69:38 eventually the things coming down
69:41 it's a horrible analogy because I love
69:43 trees but you'd understand what I'm
69:45 saying when I write scripts sometimes
69:49 life gets busy and I found that if I
69:54 just write one scene a day there aren't
69:58 that many scenes in a script you're done
70:00 in a couple weeks maybe a month and
70:02 you'll find out that you sort of build
70:04 up that rich of wool and you'll write
70:07 four scenes in one day maybe you skip a
70:09 day come back and write three I've got
70:13 to move the ball forward no matter what
70:15 so I in closing I'll just simply say
70:18 live for the now live for the external
70:21 good things that you can do for yourself
70:23 and for others if you're somehow waking
70:27 up and you don't have any moral code or
70:28 you think you or up to this point in
70:31 your life moral codes have been sort of
70:32 that thing that you know suckas do but
70:36 you realize oh [ __ ] man I really have
70:38 been hurting people maybe you would did
70:40 a lot of substance abuse up in to the
70:42 point you woke up which is usually what
70:44 happens right you stop drinking alcohol
70:46 you stop using lots of drugs and then
70:49 all of a sudden you start seeing reality
70:50 for what it is and you're like oh my god
70:52 I've been a complete piece of [ __ ]
70:54 alright don't worry about it don't worry
70:57 about it what you're gonna do right away
70:58 is you're gonna start fixing yourself
71:00 right away treat your body well you know
71:02 if you've taken a lot of drugs or
71:04 consumed a lot alcohol guarantee your
71:06 body needs to be healed might take a
71:08 decade or two to get it back to shape
71:10 but every single day you do something to
71:12 make your body more healthy you'll feel
71:15 it and you'll feel good
71:16 you'll start loving life and once you
71:18 start loving life you start loving
71:20 everything else if you're a devout
71:23 believer in karma you're probably
71:25 already trying to do this which is why
71:27 you become infuriated when others don't
71:29 well don't worry about them
71:33 you can let someone rent space in your
71:35 brain right now we do need to take
71:40 action sometimes when crazy things
71:42 become legal in your country right but I
71:46 will tell you this I've said this a long
71:48 time ago and I need to repeat it because
71:50 I haven't said it I'll probably make a
71:52 better episode to put it towards the
71:53 front of the episode but if you want to
71:56 be a sucker now the people that destroy
71:58 the world let me tell you the game that
72:00 they love that we play we focus on the
72:04 past that's what they love right there's
72:10 an event that happened in 2001 in
72:13 September and if all the people focus on
72:17 that past event they wake up every day
72:20 rewatch all the videos they spread the
72:23 news about that day now it's not like
72:27 you're not doing a little bit of justice
72:28 to the people that passed I'm not saying
72:30 that but if you focus on the past you
72:32 don't focus on the present and guess
72:34 what they own the present and you own
72:37 the past and which one can be changed
72:41 you feel me
72:44 so be careful with karma there for you
72:50 you're gonna get knocked down that's
72:52 what happens in this world and it sucks
72:53 but you know what it's also the greatest
72:56 gift you've ever been given pain I don't
73:01 know I think it's it's saddening to me
73:08 when I hear people talk about the pain
73:09 of their past constantly and you're like
73:12 well what's happening to the now
73:17 anything anything good when you look in
73:22 the mirror you're looking at the past no
73:25 you're looking at the now how many times
73:28 have you heard this little thing well
73:32 you've seen this dramatized in sitcoms
73:34 movies and you've seen it happen in real
73:36 life maybe you've even had the
73:38 opportunity to do it in your lifetime
73:40 there's a relationship you think is
73:44 going great and then you get dumped
73:47 and you you could you know and you get
73:50 dumped for like a really negative reason
73:52 something that shouldn't be occurring
73:54 you know they slept with somebody else
73:55 or whatever so they're a cheater or
73:57 whatever okay and you want to tell the
73:59 whole world that that's what they are
74:01 all right and you know I'm not gonna
74:04 tell you not to do that but the idea is
74:05 you go and become the most amazing human
74:09 being on planet earth right you get your
74:11 game together on the appearance scale
74:14 you'll get a you know you either you go
74:16 get a great job or you keep the one you
74:18 have you go and accomplish something and
74:20 you make yourself one of the most
74:22 sought-after people on planet earth and
74:25 then you bump into this other person
74:27 that dumped you and Paul if they're
74:29 interested in you know why because they
74:32 made the wrong decision they meet you
74:35 and you look great and your life is
74:37 great and they made the wrong decision
74:40 hmm maybe that is your way of passing
74:43 out a little bit of karma but the
74:45 beautiful thing is you know better than
74:47 to go back and your life is fantastic
74:50 and you know if you go back you'll go
74:51 back into that whole cycle of hitting
74:54 yourself again because you were silly to
74:56 give someone who screwed you over a
74:57 second chance now there are
75:01 circumstances where second chances are
75:04 extremely important and that's where you
75:06 get to be the authority in your own life
75:08 right any I think that's all I've got
75:10 about karma for now hope that was
75:14 entertaining or useful to your life if
75:17 you haven't into deep thoughts radio
75:19 please go it's where you can change your
75:20 feeds from audio to video so if you're
75:22 listening to this on YouTube and you
75:24 want it in your car that's a great way
75:26 to switch over vice versa the nice thing
75:29 about YouTube is you get to write
75:31 comments about what you're feeling about
75:33 a particular episode and I will tell you
75:35 I was just reminiscing with a friend of
75:37 mine the the number of times again I
75:42 can't stress this enough and you might
75:43 hear folks say this and I'm I'm gonna
75:46 tell you they probably mean it a hundred
75:47 percent it's not just to blow smoke up
75:50 the listeners butts and make them feel
75:51 good about themselves I'm telling you
75:53 you guys touch me mentally
75:58 every other day at least that's a bad
76:01 day that's a bad week usually it's every
76:02 single day someone says something it
76:04 makes my mind go oh my god a lot of
76:07 times it won't be some profound epiphany
76:11 of realization necessarily but you point
76:13 me to someone who inspired you and if I
76:16 have time in that particular pocket of
76:17 the day I'll go out and link to a video
76:19 you might give me or look up a book or
76:22 look up something on Wikipedia or
76:23 something I'll research something and
76:25 I'm like oh my god that's amazing this
76:27 particular episode I had to go refresh
76:29 my mind my knowledge excuse me about the
76:33 various definitions and schools of karma
76:35 and they're so ornate and beautiful I
76:37 try not to try not to even get into the
76:40 origins of it all because it's so
76:42 complex and and again manicured I
76:47 couldn't do it any justice if I tried
76:48 him we also have a locked Facebook group
76:51 it's on the website as well just click
76:54 Facebook it'll take you right to it
76:55 again if you're a facebook person go for
76:58 it
76:58 there's also a patreon page for a buck
77:01 you can get most these episodes a day to
77:04 three days ahead of everyone else plus
77:06 some announcements about things that are
77:08 coming that I think it's gonna blow your
77:10 mind to pieces be really good stuff
77:15 anyway take care of yourself and someone
77:17 else that I'll see in the next deep
77:19 thoughts over now
77:20 [Music]
77:29 you
