00:29 welcome back leaves and gentleman so
00:32 today I thought I would cover a subject
00:33 that we mention every once in a while on
00:35 episodes like the Bob Lazar episode when
00:37 we're talking about the propulsion
00:40 system of a UFO what we're about to talk
00:44 about is antimatter and just as theories
00:50 like the Big Bang are very appealing
00:51 because without having a science degree
00:53 one can claim they know how the universe
00:56 began I want all of this stuff to be
01:00 that easy for you to understand repeat
01:04 to someone else we may not achieve that
01:06 that you know I did my episode on
01:08 quantum computing I think once quantum
01:11 computing connects in your head you will
01:14 be able to explain how quantum computing
01:17 works in a way that you know won't take
01:20 you much effort but up until the point
01:22 you understand that you have this you
01:26 know atom twirling from 0 to 1 from the
01:32 North Pole to the South Pole constantly
01:35 and therefore when you put it into a
01:37 mathematical equation it is calculating
01:39 every possibility at the exact same time
01:40 roughly that's pretty cool right but
01:44 with antimatter it has been one of these
01:46 things where I I've read so much like
01:51 sci-fi about it you know which what I
01:53 mean by that is stuff that claims to be
01:55 science but when you really read the
01:57 fine print everything is based on a
01:59 paper that was Telly's theoretical that
02:01 was based on another paper that was
02:03 totally theoretical the amount of papers
02:05 written around antimatter what it could
02:08 be how it could be created you know we
02:11 can make it we can make it today on
02:13 earth it's an extremely expensive stuff
02:17 to make because it barely ever occurs
02:19 the idea is what is it you know that Bob
02:22 Lazar talked about being part of a
02:24 propulsion system at the bottom of a UFO
02:25 what the hell does that mean how would
02:27 that even work
02:28 how does antimatter propulsion work so I
02:31 want to get into it a little bit and
02:33 then kind of dive around the subject
02:35 because I
02:37 for my research the people that
02:40 postulated it to exist before they got
02:43 really a mechanical confirmation of it
02:45 we're all ether abased scientists and
02:48 then of course you can't know about it
02:50 because you know to understand ethers to
02:53 understand all the energy in the
02:54 universe it will teach you why
02:56 electricity crawls along wood and looks
02:59 like the veins and your lungs which also
03:01 looks like you know the branches on a
03:04 tree you know you start to understand
03:07 the whole thing it's really funny and
03:09 they just suddenly you realize there's
03:10 one law of physics for everything the
03:13 laws of the universe are universal and
03:15 so it really sums everything up but
03:20 there is a perspective and there's a
03:21 relativity to your body your mind
03:24 perceiving things that will make things
03:27 like water curving into a ball in space
03:30 not make any sense to you if you are
03:33 relative to the ground and seeing
03:34 everything flattened I just want to
03:38 throw that out there but while you're
03:39 looking at the flatter it's going see
03:41 water can't curve I'm gonna pour a big
03:44 beer right next to you that I'm gonna
03:45 hold it up your face you'll see those
03:46 bubbles in there what are those doing
03:48 you can be like shut up so you guys have
03:52 heard of an electron right electron
03:55 proton proton Neutron right neutrons
03:59 neutral proton is positive Pro and
04:03 electron is negative now I'll try to
04:09 spare a little bit of this stuff but you
04:11 have to you know for the hardcore
04:13 listeners you have to understand people
04:14 will find this episode and never watch
04:16 the other episodes so there'll be a
04:18 little bit of repetition if you aren't
04:21 able to repeat the other episodes
04:23 repetition is good for you not that it's
04:25 what I'm trying to bring wish you to
04:27 believe but at least if you're gonna you
04:30 know study this as a potential theory in
04:31 your own mind being able to repeat it
04:34 will give you the power to either
04:35 destroy the theory in your mind or to
04:38 get on board again this isn't me telling
04:42 you everything that's right I definitely
04:44 have my beliefs I definitely communicate
04:46 them as if I do believe them and I don't
04:49 always say alleged
04:51 or maybe when I maybe should for me I've
04:56 seen so much evidence of this stuff
04:58 working it just I'm done trying to
05:02 pepper everything with maybes anymore
05:06 now you're listening to someone who
05:10 believes that ether exists I believe it
05:13 because Faraday found it I believe it
05:15 because Tesla found it and I believe it
05:17 because Eric Dollard rediscovered it
05:20 using their experiments from the 1800s
05:23 using a wire and RC a naval laboratory
05:27 in the late 70s I would love to be
05:31 present during one of these experiments
05:33 but the way they say it works as a seven
05:35 foot wire can do it
05:36 you wave it in the air and there's a
05:38 disturbance on the wire in a particular
05:40 frequency where you can deduce the fact
05:42 that ether is moving 50 times the speed
05:45 of light now for some of you let's take
05:48 the speed of light as an example because
05:49 I think it'll become useful here they
05:52 tell you that the speed of light is
05:54 constant but if you go and study it
05:58 you'll realize that a lot of
06:00 universities have almost unanimously
06:02 reported different speeds not terribly
06:06 different but different now what I think
06:10 is going on in that particular situation
06:13 I do believe personally that light has a
06:16 fixed speed whatever that is so at
06:20 186,000 miles per second why would these
06:24 universities be reporting slightly
06:27 different responses from the measurement
06:30 of time or a razor bit of light excuse
06:31 me and I pretty sure we're all on the
06:35 same page that it's the medium by which
06:37 the light was traveling that would
06:41 affect its ability to get from to in a
06:45 straight line unimpeded by perhaps
06:47 gravity waves which would be the ether
06:50 or fabric of the universe being
06:52 disturbed by anything you don't see
06:55 these these waves and if they don't
06:57 factor that into your speed tests of
07:00 energy because again light is just a
07:02 wave of energy it
07:04 a transverse wave of energy it's like
07:06 flipping the sheets on your bed or
07:08 taking a rope and flipping it like the
07:11 ripples in the pond you know again I
07:13 always have this analogy it really it
07:15 really strikes people immediately they
07:17 get it when I say if I sent you out into
07:19 a pond that's up to your waist and I say
07:22 ok I'm gonna throw a rock it's gonna be
07:23 right next to you when you see the
07:25 ripples I want you to pick them up and
07:27 bring them to me and then you look at me
07:29 like what are you crazy
07:31 and the idea is you understand you can't
07:34 pick up a temporary verb of water
07:37 movement and bring it to me it isn't a
07:39 thing it is a movement it's a verb ok
07:43 well let's say that Faraday and Tesla
07:46 the two gentlemen has discovered
07:49 electricity because it already existed
07:53 right they discovered it and then
07:55 invented all of the base components that
07:58 fueled volm Volta our own Volta mixing
08:02 up other names but Almond Volta and all
08:04 the other brilliant geniuses that put
08:06 together the base components of which
08:09 then Tesla jumped off on a bunch of
08:11 other folks of course ether has a
08:14 constant pace it never slows down and it
08:19 never speeds up now what you think about
08:22 that first split second it never slows
08:24 down and it never speeds up there's no
08:27 entropy there's no inertia it merely can
08:31 be given a longer path before it's
08:36 either recognized or before it is
08:38 recognized as perhaps mass right because
08:42 if something is moving 50 times the
08:44 speed of light you're not gonna
08:45 recognize that as mess it won't even be
08:48 plasma at that speed because it's going
08:50 too quickly it's flowing through us if
08:53 it makes us everything you can see right
08:57 now in your world everything is made
09:00 from ether this one thing it is a
09:04 particle in our model it has no positive
09:08 charge it has no negative charge that is
09:10 an illusion by its behavior of how it
09:13 might get stuck in a little spinning
09:15 vortex or in a spinning sphere
09:18 why a sphere because the ether is
09:21 everywhere just like the bubble in water
09:23 right you can look at a bubble of water
09:25 and you're like dude it's round yeah
09:28 okay where is the water well it's
09:30 everywhere where is the bubble right
09:32 there why is it round well because the
09:34 water is equally pushing on the air
09:35 that's in the water that's how the earth
09:38 exists it's how all things exist it's a
09:41 natural formation now someone might say
09:44 well how does a particle exist if this
09:48 stuff keeps moving aha
09:50 there are entry points into the sphere
09:53 and their exit points to the sphere no
09:55 one need created another dimension in
09:57 time a fourth dimension to understand
10:02 this for instance when you see again the
10:06 vortex of water in your bathtub when you
10:08 pull the drain or in your sink in your
10:11 kitchen and I say well how does that
10:14 thing exist right there and you say well
10:16 because the water is going through this
10:18 behavior making that thing I'm like okay
10:21 well how does it sustain its existence
10:22 well it keeps you know there's tons of
10:24 water here and it's just all you see how
10:26 like the tornado gets a little shorter
10:27 as the that water level goes down but
10:29 it's still there it's a Fibonacci
10:32 pattern is what it is it's just not
10:36 making a leaf or cactus or a rosebud
10:40 right there's my omage to the comment
10:43 about Citizen Kane so antimatter and
10:47 matter
10:48 they're just classifications that's all
10:51 they are it's the same exact stuff made
10:55 of the same exact stuff it's just that
10:58 there is a behavior that is rare so far
11:02 it is rare in the universe that this
11:05 occurs for instance let's just say the
11:10 world's round a heliocentric ball and
11:12 it's going around another ball which is
11:14 a plasma ball at the center it's covered
11:18 in all this you know burning material on
11:21 the outside incites cold as ice it's
11:24 empty same as the earth same as the moon
11:26 so he was everything in space but we
11:29 have this or
11:30 but that is the natural orbit of the
11:34 earth well I forgot what it is but it's
11:37 there's an orbit that is the natural
11:39 orbit of all objects going around the
11:43 earth and it really is the way that we
11:46 launch everything so when we go from
11:48 Cape Canaveral in Florida and we launch
11:52 everything over the Atlantic sea that is
11:53 the natural spin of all things that are
11:56 in orbit around Earth when something
11:59 goes the opposite direction like when
12:01 SpaceX launches something over the
12:02 Pacific
12:03 it can't rendezvous with things go in
12:06 the opposite direction despite all the
12:07 BS they tell you so that's usually a spy
12:09 satellite they're putting over there to
12:11 watch our neighbors across the ocean
12:14 there's a famous satellite in space
12:18 called the Black Knight satellite which
12:20 has got you off ologists on edge because
12:23 they theorize it's been up there for
12:25 thirteen thousand years at 35,000 years
12:29 NASA claims it's a blanket that was lost
12:33 during some evie a mission the only
12:37 thing is the photographs consistently
12:39 show it in the same exact orientation
12:42 plus it hasn't fallen out of orbit which
12:46 is a natural thing that would occur but
12:48 that object in some weird way which
12:51 counteracts the NASA theory is going in
12:53 the opposite direction now maybe there's
12:56 something about a launch I don't know
12:57 from NASA but it's going the opposite
12:59 direction the reason I mentioned that
13:01 little orbit digression is that we have
13:06 ether that is going to be spinning in
13:09 one direction and it's considered a
13:11 negative and that we have a particle
13:14 that spins in the opposite direction is
13:16 considered a positive you know that
13:19 positive and positive repulse each other
13:23 but positive and negative attract to
13:25 each other the simplest way to think
13:27 about this is to car tires bumping into
13:30 each other like a Formula One car with
13:32 an open tire situation no fenders
13:34 protecting the tires if two of those
13:36 guys bump each other bump their tires
13:38 most likely the guy in the back is going
13:40 to be sent in the air because the tires
13:43 are going the
13:44 same direction so when they collide the
13:46 front ones gonna kick up the back one
13:49 however if in some strange universe the
13:53 person coming up behind him had a tire
13:55 go in the opposite direction as the back
13:57 tire he's about to bump they're gonna
13:59 marry each other perfectly because
14:01 they're gonna be going together it's a
14:04 beautiful thing if you're building a
14:06 Swiss watch you know you would never
14:07 make a gear go in the same direction as
14:10 another year and try to butt them up
14:11 against each other because they're gonna
14:12 fight for strength same thing that's
14:16 going on in the universe with ether
14:18 matter is nothing but ether getting
14:20 caught in various configurations of
14:23 swirling just like water gets cut in all
14:27 kinds of configurations of swirling as
14:29 it bumps into rocks as it bumps into the
14:32 ocean floor a beachfront a bridge pylon
14:35 it's doing all kinds of crazy things
14:37 when you look at it I think Bruce Lee
14:40 was a ether abase he always said be like
14:42 water so we know we have ether moving in
14:47 a bunch of different directions and
14:48 what's beautiful about ether as it
14:49 explains electricity absolutely
14:52 perfectly and the more you study eric
14:53 Dollard the more you're going to
14:56 completely understand
14:57 ether at just the most basic level it
15:00 completely explains gravity you know
15:03 when you hear things like you know
15:06 gravity doesn't exist or gravity's
15:08 [ __ ] what that really means is that
15:10 the definitions that have been given to
15:12 the public to describe ether are so
15:15 incorrect that that when you figure out
15:17 that it's BS it doesn't make any sense
15:19 it's like someone who was Catholic at
15:22 one point was touched by a preacher or
15:25 beat up by a nun they throw the whole
15:27 you know religion out with that
15:30 particular version of Christianity not
15:35 giving themselves a chance to find a
15:36 different version of Christianity which
15:38 doesn't have all the pedophilia and you
15:41 know ruler beating right gravity by
15:45 their you know phenomenon definition of
15:47 mass exchanging some force between mass
15:50 is all bs
15:52 it doesn't mean that I'm not sitting in
15:55 this chair effortlessly
15:56 I'm not floating in space
15:58 I'm not floating around the backyard and
16:00 so what I call ether is the process of
16:04 being pushed down to this patio now for
16:08 those of you guys who want to say oh
16:10 it's density density and buoyancy if you
16:13 go back to my original Flat Earth series
16:15 of episodes you'll hear me suggest the
16:18 same thing until I remembered in physics
16:20 class we took a we took a chamber
16:24 vacuumed out all the air with the
16:26 feather in it and my teacher just turned
16:29 it like crazy and the feather was still
16:30 falling up and you know following
16:32 according to the forces of gravity that
16:34 the earth creates very simply gravity is
16:38 the negative pressure between two bodies
16:40 that are blocking ether all winds
16:42 because they're so big Suns gigantic it
16:45 creates you know it really doesn't
16:47 create like a vacuum cleaner situation
16:50 gravity is one of the weakest forces in
16:52 the universe but it still is big enough
16:55 to keep us in this orbit we're big
16:57 enough to keep that picture of a moon up
16:59 there and I would say if we're in a
17:01 simulator of some sort then that's what
17:03 the simulator is trying to simulate for
17:05 us you know but nothing would stop a
17:08 simulator from modeling mass and energy
17:12 in this particular manner but now okay
17:15 we know that if you spin ether one way
17:20 it's considered a negative you spin it
17:22 the other way it's considered a positive
17:24 but it still is not considered
17:26 antimatter it's straight-up matter it
17:29 just has two different general behaviors
17:31 the CERN Hadron Collider smashes two
17:34 protons together two positively charged
17:38 particles after accelerating them inside
17:40 these amazing tubes using electricity to
17:44 keep the waves from banging into each
17:46 other going the same direction they want
17:48 to accelerate them up at this extreme
17:50 speed and then they modulate these two
17:53 waves until they bang into each other
17:55 they want them to bang at each other at
17:57 precisely the points inside the
18:00 collision disks okay these big giant
18:03 disks that you see what those things are
18:05 is a bunch of sense sensors that have
18:07 been mashed together such that when the
18:10 center
18:10 she blows up when these two things hit
18:13 each other which are obviously
18:14 teeny-tiny it's hurling off all of the
18:17 ether all mass that makes up this proton
18:22 because the disks are stacked
18:25 horizontally and these rounds Pizza
18:29 shapes right those disks will sense the
18:32 collision as it cuts through all of the
18:34 different slivers they use this I
18:37 believe is called Sigma 5 algorithm that
18:40 filters out white noise to say this is
18:42 probably just ancillary explosion energy
18:45 but anything that starts twirling they
18:48 start to classify that as a subatomic
18:51 particle a quark of some sort okay
18:55 or they'll declare something new if it
18:57 has you know more advanced behaviors how
19:00 many of you heard of a positron even on
19:03 Star Trek you might have antiproton
19:07 antineutron but a positron is a really
19:11 easy way to say it because it is the
19:13 opposite of an electron and there are
19:17 various techniques that when they do
19:19 collide two protons together they get
19:22 essentially anti protons the antiproton
19:26 matter coming off this thing what this
19:29 is generally classified as is when it
19:34 intersects and comes in contact with its
19:36 cousin on the other side right it's
19:40 maybe it's the evil cousin and usable
19:42 evil brother and the other ones the good
19:44 brother whatever they cancel each other
19:46 out but now what I want you to do and
19:49 they let off a tremendous amount of
19:51 energy when the two touch and this is
19:53 where we get antimatter engine theory
19:55 this is where we get antimatter fuel
19:58 theory this is where we get antimatter
20:01 triggers for nuclear bombs and this is
20:04 where we can actually theorize an
20:07 antimatter atomic bomb I think the
20:11 lowest yield atomic bomb that an
20:13 antimatter particle could create would
20:16 be a 43 Megaton bomb which outdoes the
20:21 gigantic bomb that the
20:24 Russians detonated which is the biggest
20:26 one ever which they're not quite sure
20:27 what the magnitude of that was which I
20:30 believe is called the Czar bomb okay so
20:34 if you have someone explain it to you
20:37 without a thorough knowledge the funny
20:41 thing is is that it doesn't make a hell
20:43 of a lot of sense at a physical model I
20:45 mean you can read about their theories
20:47 and go okay we're loose weight when it
20:48 unravels that lets off a bunch of energy
20:51 mm-hmm I'm going to attempt an analogy
20:54 here if we have ether orbiting in a
21:00 particle form right it's made of sphere
21:03 and then you found you you have another
21:09 particle orbiting in such a way that if
21:13 these two collide those orbital
21:15 strengths cancel each other out because
21:18 essentially whatever is creating the
21:19 crowd control for all the ether
21:22 particles to stay in this shape the
21:24 other one is perfectly created to undo
21:28 that shape and undo itself so why would
21:32 there be a gigantic release of energy I
21:36 will give you an example how many of you
21:39 have played with water in such a way
21:41 that you in fact you might have been
21:44 washing the dishes for the first time I
21:46 actually give you a great example this
21:48 isn't exactly technically the physical
21:50 model but we'll go back to the physical
21:52 model once you understand this how many
21:54 of you have washed utensils and a sink
21:56 and it's going great you clean your
21:59 knife off because that peanut butter you
22:00 didn't clean off the first day it takes
22:03 a little while get the water really hot
22:05 clean off the fork what a pain in the
22:07 ass it cuts into your sponge then you're
22:10 cleaning a spoon and it's going great
22:12 you got the spoon upside down so it's
22:14 hitting the the convex shape seconds you
22:18 roll it over and you just hit it just
22:21 right with your hot water
22:23 you got water all over the place right
22:26 it all of a sudden splatters off that
22:28 concave shape
22:29 hichy in the face goes all over the
22:31 counter damn it and you got to clean up
22:34 a big mess
22:35 so imagine a particle that's moving
22:38 fifty times the speed of light now it
22:41 will always be not slowed down by its
22:44 neighboring particles but it will be
22:46 redirected to synchronize with its
22:50 neighbors meaning don't create a ripple
22:52 just go with the flow
22:54 here's a 405 traffic stop driving
22:57 zigzags banging into everybody just go
23:00 straight north or south you pick it so
23:02 you have in order to have even an
23:04 electron you have an enormous amount of
23:08 ether or particles that have to
23:10 participate in that orbit to create
23:12 something that you can recognize as an
23:13 electron which is a very small atomic
23:16 element but now you bang it against a
23:20 positron it's opposite cousin that can
23:24 undo it as well as be undone by it by
23:27 its by its friend okay that that undoing
23:33 process is just as crazy and is messy as
23:39 accidentally putting the water down on
23:41 that spoon when you're cleaning it
23:43 except it's worse it does the spoon
23:48 trick instead of just popping up out of
23:50 the concave shape of a spoon it is doing
23:53 that in every single direction and it is
23:57 obviously surrounded just like the
24:00 bubble and the glass it's surrounded by
24:02 water which if I said where's the water
24:05 around the bubble you say well it's
24:06 everywhere around the bowl okay I mean
24:09 there's a lot of particles pushing on
24:11 the bubble yeah and and they're all
24:13 they're moving around constantly yeah
24:15 but that thing still remains around
24:16 perfect sphere yeah okay just once you
24:20 keep reminding you guys that so imagine
24:23 that whole thing disintegrating because
24:26 of literally opposite polarities that
24:29 undo each other and it's messy it's
24:32 flying around like crazy that starts to
24:38 create a cascade of realized matter in a
24:42 chaotic form it can thermalize it can
24:46 turn into plasma
24:49 gets messy which is why if you made an
24:52 atomic bomb out of such a thing say a
24:55 gram of this stuff which I think would
24:57 cost a couple billion dollars to make a
25:00 gram be hell of an expensive bomb but it
25:05 is going to be the most disruptive thing
25:07 if we ever created that bomb whatever
25:11 would be in its path would be so utterly
25:13 obliterated I don't think we've ever
25:17 seen anything like that in in world
25:20 history and believe me we never do now
25:24 these crazy scientists are creating this
25:27 stuff how they maintain it I'm not
25:30 exactly sure because how would you
25:31 maintain antimatter inside of a matter
25:35 container how do you keep it from
25:37 touching the edge now once it's created
25:40 and we're going to go back to its
25:41 creation but once it's created and if
25:45 you could control it then again the
25:50 possibilities are actually very
25:52 interesting Bob lazarre's ship which
26:00 again I kind of got to the end of my
26:01 episode and because of his claim to
26:03 degrees in two different places at the
26:05 same time at the same time necessarily
26:08 but he has no photographs from going to
26:10 college and at MIT I mean come on the
26:14 fastest degree thus to get even with his
26:17 advanced brain would be at least a
26:19 couple years you would have some
26:20 Polaroids in the early eighties you know
26:23 very specifically of being there for a
26:26 long time you would have been at a dorm
26:29 you would have driven a car I mean you
26:31 would have registration papers you'd
26:33 have a million proofs about that Plus
26:37 anyone who was his cousin uncle and
26:39 father mother brothers sister whatever
26:41 buddy would be like I got this buddy
26:44 named Bob Lazar the dude just finished
26:46 his degree at at Caltech and now he's
26:49 over to MIT he's getting his physics
26:50 degree you know be back in seven years
26:54 you know Ruby five at the earliest right
26:57 the dude would have been displaced for a
26:59 really long time so I think his story's
27:01 bunk
27:02 simply because of those claims I mean
27:05 the only way that he could still be on
27:06 target and and have those claims as if
27:08 those claims were brainwashed into his
27:10 mind I don't know but I'm done trying to
27:14 build people out of their own [ __ ]
27:15 right but here's the interesting thing
27:18 about an antimatter engine participating
27:20 in moving some sort of object or vehicle
27:23 through space and having complete
27:25 command over gravity when you're dealing
27:28 with antimatter you are dealing with the
27:31 very orbital instincts of ether what it
27:36 typically does you know it typically
27:37 creates the atomic elements that we are
27:39 aware of perhaps it creates quarks as
27:41 well but it's also creating anti
27:44 everything else if this is true so what
27:47 would be a great methodology for saying
27:50 you know all gravity is is ether all
27:53 winds pushing down on us relative to our
27:56 perspective of being on this ball in
27:57 space that's why I'm sitting here you
28:01 know it's also making all the oxygen
28:03 above me and there is a pressure on top
28:06 of me as well for slightly other reasons
28:09 right but if you wanted to move around
28:13 space effortlessly then you're gonna
28:14 want to move ether out of the way to
28:17 create a negative pocket in front of
28:19 your ship so that your ship will just
28:21 naturally flow in that pocket
28:22 why because ether is everywhere pushing
28:25 on every side of you and if you can
28:26 create a device that creates a frequency
28:29 it starts to move stuff out of the way
28:31 you'll just fall under that space how
28:33 many of you have had a cheerio floating
28:35 on the zero-gravity plane of milk and
28:37 you put your spoon in there and you
28:39 break the tension of the milk and the
28:41 chair goes BAM up against it material is
28:43 actually glom together
28:45 partially because of the tension of the
28:47 surface of milk but a lot of it's just
28:49 straight-up gravity they're they're
28:52 creating little negative pockets between
28:53 each other they go BAM it's cool but the
28:56 Cheerios are not exchanging information
28:58 coming hey come over here I'm grounding
29:00 the phenomenon gravity what oh yeah sure
29:02 nah they're just being pushed together
29:05 by ether now in order to command ether
29:11 to construct these anti-matter particles
29:16 which science in it's serendipity have
29:20 created and figured out how there's a
29:21 bunch of different ways they're created
29:25 it's very rare and so the first thing
29:29 the scientists have discovered this
29:31 antimatter behavior in antimatter I
29:35 don't want to say mass anti mass was
29:38 that they were like well wait a minute
29:39 there's this old theory for every
29:42 reaction there's an equal and opposite
29:43 reaction hmm what a mathematical level
29:48 that would mean that for every particle
29:50 of matter there should be a particle of
29:54 antimatter but they cannot figure that
29:57 out they can't find that anywhere in the
30:01 universe it is still an extremely rare
30:03 thing that happens you know it could it
30:07 could just be a simply a really really
30:09 rare configuration that ends up
30:11 happening for those of you have ever
30:13 really paid attention to moving your arm
30:16 through the surface of the water and a
30:19 pool and you watch all those little
30:21 vortexes because it distorts light right
30:23 it refracts light and so you can
30:24 actually watch the bottom of a pool I
30:26 know that every single one of you have
30:28 done this you move your hand over and
30:30 you see those little little tornadoes
30:32 you don't actually see them in the water
30:34 half the time but you see the refraction
30:36 of the currents that you've created with
30:38 your hand spiraling out of existence at
30:41 the surface of water
30:42 you're absolutely looking at de facto
30:45 the same exact algorithms of ether at
30:48 the sub sub sub atomic level I promise
30:53 you well what's the majority of the
30:56 water doing the majority of the water is
30:58 moving with your hand as you move it but
31:00 these little tiny vortexes are like
31:01 these little barnacle fish that are
31:03 chasing after the big fish you know as
31:05 an analogy so it could be that as mass
31:09 forms in the universe again if you look
31:12 out there in space if it's truly out
31:13 there and it's a it's not a vacuum but
31:15 it's actually a big pool of ether out
31:19 there well we think we can see the moon
31:22 because there's nothing between it there
31:24 is a bunch of stuff but
31:25 there's these particles moving 50 times
31:28 the speed of light between us and the
31:30 moon I can be right underneath the moon
31:32 and I don't float out in space because
31:34 they're still either pushing down on top
31:35 of me okay the same orbital lock that
31:40 the moon might be in is the same orbital
31:43 locked and electron will have towards
31:45 its core of a proton Neutron same thing
31:50 but now if you could unravel all of the
31:55 let's just take the moon and say we have
31:57 an anti-mutant so we're gonna we're
31:59 gonna essentially go into that inner
32:00 space thing where we've zoomed down
32:02 we've shrunken ourselves way way down
32:04 and now the earth is the proton and the
32:06 moon is an electron but here comes an
32:11 anti moon a positron if we're out there
32:14 watching it you know it's probably some
32:16 black void in space right and it's
32:18 coming at the moon who east you know you
32:19 suddenly can't see the stars because
32:21 it's blocking it and they start touching
32:23 if all of that ether all matter which is
32:28 just simply behaving in an opposite
32:30 behavior completely opposite behavior
32:32 not just an opposite spin and it hits
32:37 that moon which is going in the normal
32:40 orientation of all mass in the universe
32:43 you're gonna have a supernova at a level
32:46 that maybe the universe hasn't seen I
32:49 mean it's gonna make like the Horsehead
32:50 Nebula in one second the way this
32:53 thing's gonna unravel and go nuts
32:56 probably the amount of I mean I don't
32:58 know I don't know if it would actually
32:59 create any photons that we could see cuz
33:02 maybe everything's being canceled out so
33:03 much that we wouldn't see it but I would
33:06 hate to think that they're happy this
33:07 giant pocket that's just a void of
33:09 everything because the stuff cancelled
33:11 out so well that the black space that we
33:15 see which is not a vacuum it's full of
33:19 incredibly dense not infinitely dense
33:21 but incredibly dense ether it just turns
33:24 back into that stuff and it just starts
33:26 participating someplace else as it moves
33:28 around the universe now Bob lazarre's
33:31 spaceship the theory goes as follows if
33:35 you didn't see my episode 401
33:38 there's an element 115 that back in the
33:41 early 90s when Bob Lazar came clean
33:44 which is technically I think 89 we
33:48 couldn't make 115 we theorized it we'd
33:50 never made it I think in 2003 we put
33:55 together we slammed two elements
33:58 together to get to the 115 count but
34:02 according to him this 115 which is
34:05 extremely difficult to create not quite
34:07 as bad as antimatter but you create it
34:09 and these little coin shaped cylinder
34:13 slices and they would stack them up but
34:16 they'd also rotate them as they're
34:18 stacking them up because they have a
34:20 natural magnetic pole around them like
34:23 all mass does so when they rotate them a
34:27 little bit as they stack them up they
34:28 start to do what a coil does a coil and
34:32 a wire can take the amperage of a
34:36 current and double it every single time
34:39 it reconnects with the previous coil
34:41 because it's compounding the force again
34:47 I trying to think of how that would be
34:49 easily described using you know
34:52 wrestlers do haymakers right so you can
34:55 punch someone with your fist and it has
34:57 so much power but if you were to clasp
35:00 both your hands and then jump up in the
35:01 air and hit them with both hands you're
35:03 compounding the pressure that's going to
35:05 transfer from you into the other person
35:08 and you start breaking bones and
35:09 probably consequently hurting your hand
35:12 so that's kind of what a coil does it
35:15 compounds the frequencies because they
35:17 team up it's the bridge like I always
35:20 say that gains the frequency it's built
35:22 at the frequency of the wind that goes
35:23 by on a windy day let's go any day and
35:26 eventually the bridge starts you know
35:28 oscillating and then breaks which is why
35:32 we build bridges better today
35:34 so they to finish this thing off they
35:37 take these little disks and they rotate
35:38 them to create this significantly more
35:42 powerful natural frequency out of the
35:43 115 and then he said they laid it down
35:47 to a cone I guess you could just think
35:51 of a little piece of incent you know
35:52 looks like the cone that make that about
35:55 I think it's about three inches tall
35:57 something like that and then he said
35:59 once they get it to the cone format they
36:02 then slice off one side go equally over
36:05 about it looked to me like he was about
36:08 a quarter-inch and they sliced the other
36:09 side so everything else is just thrown
36:11 away which is the majority of this 115
36:15 is really cut away then you have this
36:19 slice of this cone that is made up of a
36:23 bunch of rotating cylinders of this
36:27 stuff and that particular shape
36:29 supposedly is the ultimate shape to
36:32 continually exponentially increase the
36:36 natural frequency /e throw wind off of
36:40 this 115 then they put it aside this
36:44 half dome container with a rod that went
36:49 up to the ceiling which then goes out
36:51 into an arc which goes into the top of
36:54 each one of the antimatter engines being
36:56 three I hope that doesn't get totally
37:00 nuts for you now from that point he's a
37:02 little bit hazy on at least in all the
37:06 lectures I've ever seen I want exactly
37:08 how the thing is stimulated from that
37:10 point it would seem like you wouldn't
37:12 necessarily want it to be a constant
37:16 maybe it is a constant and there's
37:18 something else they can do to juice it
37:20 up maybe just hit that little bell down
37:22 there and it goes little nuts but at
37:25 that point it's then metabolized in
37:27 these big cylinders and he gave us the
37:30 impression there about 10 inches to a
37:33 foot in diameter these cylinders that
37:35 hang on these spindles I guess through
37:38 the center of the spindle is coming this
37:39 frequency from the 115 and then by
37:45 rotating these cylinders you can start
37:50 to create directional movement from your
37:53 ship now the cool thing that he
37:55 clarified in the documentary which I
37:57 never heard him say in his lectures in
37:59 the 90s and the early 2000s was that the
38:02 ship actually flies upside down so the
38:04 one in the intro to this
38:06 show is sort of a joke it's the normal
38:08 1950s impression of how those things
38:11 could work he does say that that's
38:14 possible by taking all the antimatter
38:16 engines appointing them at one side and
38:17 you can suck the ship directly to its
38:19 side but he says when it makes long
38:21 journeys it actually turns belly up and
38:24 points the belly of the ship exactly at
38:28 its target and then it just hauls but
38:29 straight towards the target I think
38:31 that's kind of cool what isn't clear to
38:33 me is why they would call it an
38:35 antimatter engine apparently I've never
38:40 heard you know 115 being accused of
38:43 creating antimatter but perhaps it
38:45 creates so much energy that whatever is
38:47 in these cylinders which is again
38:49 supposedly on these ancient diagrams
38:51 from previous cultures that have lived
38:53 here on earth it is able to metabolize
38:56 the frequency to start creating this
39:00 anomaly in the universe that is
39:02 antimatter now what's interesting about
39:04 it for me is that with just basic theory
39:07 of ether there's no need for antimatter
39:09 whatsoever
39:10 it's just romantic to say antimatter if
39:13 you just create a normal frequency of
39:16 ether all wind same stuff you get out of
39:19 a magnet for instance right the magnets
39:21 moving the shavings on the piece of
39:22 paper if you do that little experiment
39:24 well as long as that stuff is you know
39:27 it's all ether in general but as long as
39:28 you can command a pole of ether that is
39:31 so fast and so dense it will start
39:34 pushing back it starts becoming like the
39:37 wall of the Sun which is a big plasma
39:40 interior wall the bottom of the ship
39:43 should glow because it will end up
39:45 slowing down enough in its path not
39:48 slowing down necessarily speed but its
39:50 path increases through its configuration
39:53 that it starts to glow because it starts
39:55 to create this ripple of energy that are
39:58 our eyes recognizes light I hope this is
40:02 not getting lost anywhere so the they've
40:05 come up with this term I believe it's
40:08 pronounced Baro Genesis or Baro Genesis
40:12 it is the moment in which this anomaly
40:16 occurs between matter and antimatter
40:18 when it starts to do the unraveling
40:20 process they've got a name for it so
40:24 when they figured this out they were
40:26 able to go out and start to look for it
40:30 antimatter really a positron and what
40:34 they discovered was that beta radiation
40:38 from isotopes actually creates this and
40:42 that that makes sense because an isotope
40:45 would be something that would be on an
40:47 ether level fairly violent you ever
40:50 wonder why uranium is so radioactive
40:52 it's because it is an unstable thing in
40:57 the universe an atom has become so heavy
40:59 and so complex from 230 so to 33 to 37
41:05 somewhere in there that's the range of
41:06 uranium that you get anomalies you get
41:10 weirdness it's a fascinating thing that
41:13 uranium can exist the anything
41:15 radioactive naturally radioactive can
41:17 exist because it's sort of suggesting
41:19 that the universe got to its limit and
41:22 that's it anything over that it can't
41:25 come together you know I'm not saying
41:27 that that's the case but I'm sure that
41:29 an atomic a particular say periodic
41:36 table elements getting up to 450 or 550
41:39 or a thousand is probably impossible
41:42 because it would simply take too much
41:44 energy to hold it together that there's
41:46 not enough natural movement of ether to
41:50 make that happen
41:51 now what's interesting about that is if
41:53 you start to look at the theory of ether
41:56 and we want to see if we wanted a
41:57 theorized how big a particle of ether
41:59 was it might be interesting to reverse
42:02 engineer the most stable atom of the
42:05 universe which might be hydrogen all the
42:07 way up to 238 and see mathematically
42:12 inside of a computer when if we just
42:16 created basically inert particles that
42:19 were teeny tiny and we create a super
42:21 dense computer model that's able to hold
42:24 quadrillions of this stuff and say a
42:26 sugar cube or the eye of the needle
42:30 quite frankly
42:32 when would we start having things
42:34 naturally fall apart where those ether
42:38 particles just get to the point where
42:40 they're so dense they just bang into
42:43 each other constantly and they cannot
42:45 settle down and I'll give you an example
42:48 of how that might go for any of you that
42:51 have seen say a subway system in India
42:57 China or even Japan they are amazing at
43:03 getting on these Subway's because they
43:05 have way too many people and not enough
43:07 mass transit so it becomes this this
43:10 free-for-all in one way it's almost like
43:14 a cordial violence getting on this thing
43:17 in India it's so bad that they have
43:21 female trains in some places in India
43:25 and male trains because they don't trust
43:27 the boys to be squished so closely to
43:29 the girls because everyone's grabbing
43:30 everybody's butt and other things but
43:33 now imagine you know you they have
43:35 accepted and figured out how many people
43:37 they can push but they've got people
43:39 that work for the transit companies the
43:41 train companies and they actually go to
43:43 every door before the thing can take off
43:45 and they're pushing everyone inside and
43:47 it's just it's amazing and then the door
43:49 shuts that some guy's face is mashed up
43:51 against the glass that's a real life
43:52 thing that happens well that might be
43:55 your uranium-238 and not another person
43:58 can fit inside that train given the
44:02 constraints that no one's gonna be like
44:03 surfing on everybody's head lying down
44:06 so you try to push in too much the train
44:09 would explode technically speaking right
44:11 you know we're not stronger than the
44:13 Train but if we're made of steel we're
44:15 robots the train would explode it just
44:17 start bulging that might be what happens
44:20 when you try to stuff too much ether
44:21 ether into a particular orbital
44:23 configuration have you ever seen a bug
44:27 that looks like a leaf and it seems like
44:31 oh my god I mean I'm pretty sure God's
44:33 having a great time up there messing
44:35 around but there's a praying mantis
44:38 species that looks like a leaf some of
44:42 them are brown some of them are green
44:44 and I mean you look at
44:46 little wings it looks like a leaf I mean
44:49 identical there's you know butterflies
44:52 that have the same anomaly and you
44:54 wonder how could a living insect who's
44:57 not a plant create a plant facsimile
45:01 that's absolutely perfect the reason
45:05 being is it the laws of how mass moves
45:08 in the universe is unified again a lot
45:12 of you've seen this recently we've had a
45:14 couple posts on our Facebook page of the
45:18 vascular system of a lung and the
45:22 branches of a tree and it's identical
45:25 and you know that there's plenty more
45:28 examples of that again there's a lot of
45:30 videos on YouTube where they burn wood
45:33 with electricity and the way it crawls
45:35 across the electricity or crawls across
45:37 the wood surface is exactly the shape of
45:40 a lung vascular system or the branches
45:43 on a tree it's exact same thing now
45:48 could you imagine you want to be a
45:49 doctor you're a kid and you're like I
45:51 want to study the vascular system of the
45:54 human body at a level that no one else
45:57 has figured it out and so you take that
46:00 kid or you go if you're the kid and you
46:02 go to a forest that has trees with a
46:05 massive number of branches because some
46:08 trees don't rain they go way way up and
46:10 they do have them way up there but
46:11 they're you know 200 feet up and you
46:13 can't see them but a nice little tree
46:15 like the one I have that's in the
46:16 shadows back there or the spaceship
46:18 lands it's essentially a big vein that's
46:24 what it is same way it spawns a little
46:26 branch it is the way the vein works but
46:30 now at the end of a branch you get this
46:32 a new anomaly called a leaf well the
46:36 same thing that makes a leaf on a plant
46:38 is the same thing makes leaf on a tree
46:40 same thing that makes that wing on a
46:44 mantis look exactly the same
46:47 everything's made it ether everything
46:50 has to obey the laws of ether and you'll
46:54 notice that that that veiny thing comes
46:57 out of the center
46:58 of the initial spine of a leaf the leaf
47:02 starts out really teeny-tiny right and
47:04 then it creates little ribs that go out
47:06 to the edge and then it just kind of
47:08 webs it together between the ribs
47:11 the thicker ribs spine of a leaf is
47:15 obviously the the main thoroughfare for
47:18 the water that would come up from a root
47:21 or the blood that comes up through a
47:24 mantis
47:25 it's obeying the same loss color well
47:29 it's just fortunate that they have
47:31 different colors it's amazing now we're
47:34 talking about antimatter but I want you
47:36 to get a really good grasp of ether all
47:38 winds and how it affects everything so
47:41 that you see the universe it's just one
47:43 whole thing so one of the uses that
47:47 they're starting to put together is in
47:51 the medical industry most of you are
47:54 familiar with like a cat scan or other
47:56 scanning scanning hardware software
47:58 where they're hitting you with a bunch
48:00 of particles of a particular kind
48:03 sometimes they will shoot two things at
48:06 once and find out how it splashes off of
48:08 each other and then based on that they
48:09 can designate whether or not it's a bone
48:11 a vessel a piece of tissue and they can
48:14 start creating these images of your body
48:16 I have my body scanned in my early 40s
48:19 just for the hell of it as I wanted to
48:21 know if I had any genetic heart problems
48:24 or you know if I had any M cholesterol
48:28 plating in my and my arteries and my
48:31 heart and I was in the top 3% basically
48:34 with nothing but he created a
48:37 three-dimensional image of my body
48:38 actually surfed through my body is
48:40 amazing now what they're doing is by
48:44 finding antimatter behaviors in Mass and
48:48 finding out when it occurs they're able
48:51 to recognize that you know if you don't
48:54 build a sensor for something you never
48:55 know it's there once you build a sensor
48:57 for it and you understand how it behaves
48:59 then you can introduce a bunch of new
49:02 inventions based on that but they found
49:06 these natural circumstances where
49:08 positrons are emitted
49:10 during various scanning procedures and
49:13 now they can start recognizing them and
49:15 then of course studying how they how
49:19 they behave through human flesh so that
49:21 they can recognize it and perhaps show
49:24 us more detail on our body the beautiful
49:27 thing about sensing a really small
49:29 atomic element is that the imaging
49:32 resolution becomes insane which is great
49:36 there's a in most 3d software they're
49:39 now starting to play with what's called
49:42 voxels vo XEL and it's a binary concept
49:48 of either a cubic space literally a
49:53 six-sided cube is either on or off based
49:56 on what is creating the sense of whether
49:58 or not that's on or off and what color
50:00 it might be meaning it might be bone
50:02 color might be blood color might be
50:04 tissue color of all kinds of different
50:06 densities they created this back in the
50:09 80s at least by the 80s where they were
50:12 using it for imaging systems of tissue
50:15 there was a company I believe called
50:18 novalogic back in the late 80s early 90s
50:22 they had this game called Apache which
50:24 used a voxel terrain system to create
50:28 these beautiful terrains like just
50:30 canyons but then they put polygons
50:32 helicopters in there and the beautiful
50:34 thing was the terrain in voxel
50:36 mathematics is extremely fast because
50:38 you can do what's called voxel clipping
50:41 which is if you can't see a voxel you
50:44 just stop processing so you only process
50:47 the layer of these little tiny cubes
50:50 which can look very smooth when you when
50:52 you crank up the resolution but it's
50:55 very quick for old computers the old 386
50:58 46 computers to give you real-time
51:01 software rendering and then you can give
51:03 all your processing power to the
51:05 textures and polygons of your helicopter
51:07 guy made a ton of money it's amazing but
51:11 the resolution is so high today that now
51:13 software like blender 3d which you can
51:16 download for free at blender org
51:18 definitely get into that if you have any
51:21 interest in becoming a 3d artist because
51:23 the community is
51:23 massive the product super-powerful it's
51:26 what I created that UFO with free
51:28 software people you got to know how to
51:32 do a bunch of wild stuff to get that
51:33 kind of thing to happen but believe me
51:35 just YouTube it until you figured out
51:37 but that is sort of the medical use
51:41 that's going on plus they're trying to
51:44 figure out a way to treat cancer by
51:47 manipulating antimatter now again
51:50 they're never going to have tremendous
51:52 amounts of antimatter in a hospital
51:55 unless we have some revolutionary way to
51:56 create it for under a few hundred
51:59 million dollars I mean it's it's just
52:02 just an infinitesimal amount of
52:03 antimatter will run a quarter of a
52:06 billion dollars so that you know these
52:09 techniques are in their infantile stages
52:11 but it's actually very interesting but I
52:13 want to tell you between episodes
52:15 you know I am constantly looking at the
52:18 universe and II throw away I read papers
52:22 where it is like I read the papers about
52:24 antimatter to do this episode you see
52:28 these scientists and you almost wonder
52:30 if they're all fudging it or if they're
52:33 all just I wouldn't say blissfully
52:37 ignorant but totally ignorant about
52:38 ether because once you start
52:41 conceptualizing ether and seeing the
52:44 examples I keep giving you over and over
52:45 again I keep giving you very simple ones
52:47 so you don't get confused hopefully you
52:50 read these papers and you're like guys
52:51 if you would just reintroduce ether into
52:54 your world and then reread all your
52:56 research papers especially the theory
52:58 papers where no one knows whether or not
53:00 it's true or not or how it works or why
53:03 antimatter would give off a tremendous
53:05 amount of energy when it hits mass it
53:08 all clicks and it all explains itself
53:11 and you want to be there you want to be
53:14 on the literally on the event horizon of
53:17 research because you are acknowledging
53:19 the universe for exactly what it is and
53:22 whether or not you're looking at a plant
53:24 in my backyard a tree a scan of your
53:28 lung anything it all
53:32 homogenizes together you don't need to
53:36 know
53:37 exactly to the you know ether a particle
53:41 exactly how everything works but I bet
53:43 you could
53:43 by studying the bigger things right as
53:46 it is above so - is it below so you just
53:50 use that theory which is a very
53:51 beautiful line I mean if God wrote any
53:54 sentence for a man - here it is that
53:57 sentence but you want to reverse it
53:58 every once in a while - as it is below
54:01 so - it is a blah above so you know when
54:06 you study science and especially any
54:10 level of atomic physics particle physics
54:14 you really have three realms that this
54:16 science is applied to the realm urine
54:19 which is the seeable observable universe
54:22 then you have your subatomic universe
54:24 which is everything that's teeny tiny
54:27 that you can't discern with your eyeball
54:28 and then you have the macro universe
54:30 which is what is essentially the
54:32 cosmology universe how many of you
54:36 learned about the golden mean or
54:39 otherwise known as the Fibonacci pattern
54:41 and you immediately realize that you're
54:44 onto something and you know that
54:48 chronologically speaking you didn't
54:50 invent it you know you weren't the
54:52 discoverer of it it's been in the
54:54 universe for for its existence but it's
54:56 also been in artwork and you know from
55:00 tiles and cathedrals - da Vinci or
55:04 should say Leonardo's work again we got
55:08 to stop saying da Vinci for Leonardo's
55:11 name da Vinci means from Venice it's not
55:14 his name his name was Leonardo sorry for
55:17 making a bunch of lighter noise I had to
55:20 refill it here but you start seeing the
55:23 Fibonacci pattern in your backyard you
55:25 see it in a rose again you see in a
55:27 cactus you see it all over the place you
55:30 look at the thorns coming out of a rose
55:32 stem if you look right down the barrel
55:35 of it they're coming out in a perfect
55:37 spiral
55:38 they actually hit they actually come out
55:40 of it right on a rhythm it's amazing so
55:43 you see that you're like oh my god I'm
55:45 starting to see the universe I'm
55:46 starting to see how this thing's put
55:48 together but then you can't go any
55:49 further than that
55:50 sometimes that's why that was my
55:52 experience about four years ago when
55:54 that really hit me hard but what I want
55:57 you to do is to realize you're starting
56:00 to look right at either you're starting
56:03 to see it work you want to see some
56:05 ether working I don't care how old you
56:08 are and how silly you might feel go to
56:11 your kitchen get something to stop up
56:14 the drain fill that thing right to the
56:17 brim right to the point your wife your
56:19 husband's going what are you doing here
56:20 like Shh given the Christopher Walken
56:23 Shh you know not the Illuminati one but
56:26 the Christopher Walken one way more way
56:28 more impressive and then reaching slowly
56:31 and pull the plug out and then watch
56:32 that vortex watch it pay attention to it
56:36 you are looking at the algorithm of the
56:40 universe I mean looking at it and you're
56:42 looking at it in a I wouldn't say
56:45 two-dimensional method you are seeing it
56:47 in three dimensions but you're not
56:48 seeing the spherical methodology but you
56:50 are definitely seeing it the vector of
56:53 force and the natural spiral every time
56:56 I take a shower because I have long hair
56:58 every other day or so I got a kick the
57:01 hair off the drain before it's going to
57:02 drain right I hate that process as soon
57:06 as you kick it off the water that's been
57:08 still I just immediately see it
57:10 spiralling like a galaxy right down the
57:12 hole and it's funny because the suds
57:14 from like hair [ __ ]
57:16 it starts look like stars he said then
57:19 you're going my god I'm just looking at
57:20 the looking at a galaxy spinning in the
57:22 universe yeah yes I have not seen a
57:25 galaxy through a telescope personally
57:28 just the images that they give to me
57:31 which is really sad because obviously
57:33 when you look at the news and you see
57:35 anyone tell you that there's a black
57:36 hole here and there or some planet they
57:39 found they literally give you like a
57:42 Star Trek rendering and you know your
57:45 layman's going man that's a photograph
57:46 of the faraway planets like no it's not
57:49 if it was that close we'd fly to it okay
57:52 now they're telling us okay that they
57:56 can through a spectrogram through some
57:58 shift of light they can see antimatter
58:00 because they they actually sorry they
58:04 said
58:04 the emissions the wave emissions off of
58:08 space stuff right the center of the
58:11 galaxy I love the way they can they can
58:14 supposedly look at the center of the
58:15 galaxy and just see all this light
58:18 coming off of it well yeah I have seen
58:21 the Milky Way and the most stunning
58:24 since a lot of you have you can go out
58:27 and the remoteness I've been on havasu
58:29 light lake when it's as still as glass I
58:32 was in Copper Canyon you know that the
58:35 Copper Cove excuse me and it's just
58:37 still I've been on the boat I do the
58:41 Titanic thing we're staying right on the
58:42 edge of the boat and so I've got a
58:45 landscape that's just this Pierce little
58:47 landscape which kind of get turns into
58:48 bigger you know mountainscapes on the
58:50 side you know a little mountains but
58:52 like little cool hilly formations and I
58:55 got the Milky Way coming up in front of
58:58 me and it's also mirroring down on the
58:59 lake so it feels like you're standing in
59:01 space it's the most disorienting thing
59:04 you've ever seen if you've had a few
59:06 Jager bombs that gets more distorting
59:09 when I grew up in Kansas where you'd
59:11 have to just drive maybe two or three
59:13 miles out of town for my little teeny
59:15 town and I'm sitting in an observatory
59:17 basically instead of seeing 1,200 stars
59:20 I'm seeing 2,500 stars once my light
59:23 what's my eyeballs acclimate I don't
59:25 know about you but I have never seen
59:27 anything that looks like the center of
59:29 our galaxy when looking at the Milky Way
59:31 ever and if they're supposed to be this
59:34 big bright spot in the center of a
59:36 galaxy because you see all those spiral
59:38 galaxy pictures that they show us
59:40 wouldn't it be really bright for us to
59:43 see the center of our galaxy in fact
59:45 could that be muted during the day by
59:47 blue atmosphere I tend to think not and
59:51 I know it's a far away thing but lights
59:55 pretty powerful and if I can see a star
59:57 that's supposed to be way way out there
60:00 I should be able to see definitely the
60:02 center of our galaxy which is supposedly
60:03 this today
60:06 it's a BS theory of a black hole in the
60:08 center of the galaxy I don't know why
60:11 they so want the black hole thing to be
60:13 there judging from all of the doomsday
60:16 predictions of
60:17 coal's by NASA especially in other
60:20 science institutions it's a cash cow
60:23 that little fear-mongering bs theory is
60:26 a huge cash cow and again say it again I
60:29 was a black hole addict in the all the
60:34 way through the 80s and definitely half
60:36 a decade into the 90s before Hawking and
60:40 a bunch of other folks said yeah if
60:41 these things exist they immediately
60:43 dissipate so they don't exist and then
60:45 one book later he's talking about how
60:47 they exist to get like someone smacked
60:48 his hand or wrote his book for him right
60:51 here's the good news because there is so
60:55 much doomsday stuff at the black hole
60:57 level but I'm in my backyard you might
61:01 be in your car your living room you
61:03 might be in your backyard what they want
61:06 you to believe is that the universe is
61:08 so utterly unstable which is just it's a
61:12 funny sum total by ignorant scientists
61:15 that are I guess trying to be smart I
61:17 don't know maybe they really are trying
61:18 to be smart maybe they're dumb and
61:20 because they know a few concepts that
61:22 blow people's minds forever their
61:24 neighbor goes by a smart whatever but
61:27 they want you to believe that we could
61:29 just be sitting here in the backyard all
61:30 of a sudden right next to my head
61:32 antimatter happens an event horizon
61:35 starts and kapu here comes a black hole
61:37 and it's gonna suck me into it and I'm
61:39 gonna die even the theory of a black
61:41 hole requires four of our sons at the
61:45 minimum amount of mass this is all bs up
61:50 to about twelve times the size of our
61:52 Sun anything lowered smaller net three
61:54 or less turns into brown dwarfs and
61:57 other things white dwarfs anything
61:59 higher than twelve times the mass of our
62:03 Sun would supernova and never turn into
62:06 an event horizon thus a black hole they
62:09 don't exist
62:10 they don't exist they don't exist okay
62:12 if they exist the very creation of them
62:17 behavior of them an existence is
62:19 completely an entirely different than
62:22 anything man is ever theorized it would
62:24 only be probably true based on a tiny
62:29 little anomaly that light is an
62:32 a pattern of movement by which it is
62:35 stuck in this pattern but it will not
62:38 gain okay because gravity is not mass
62:42 pulling against mass its displacement
62:44 okay so for instance if you had a bunch
62:49 of mass really really dense
62:51 somewhere in the universe and let's say
62:53 it crushes down to the size of our moon
62:56 take 12 sons and you crush it down to
62:59 the size of the moon let's just give
63:01 that as a theory what they want you to
63:04 believe is that's gonna have more
63:05 gravity that if our moon was right next
63:08 to it why because they see if there's
63:11 more atomic particles inside this ball
63:16 because in their theory particles talk
63:18 to each other an exchange mass which is
63:21 totally incorrect that you're gonna get
63:23 this giant sucked towards the one it's
63:24 the black hole and the moon is just the
63:27 moon is cool
63:28 the truth of matter is because gravity
63:31 is displacement of ether especially
63:34 through a winds flying all over the
63:36 universe there shouldn't be there might
63:38 be a little bit more of a violent speed
63:42 around the the one that is the black
63:45 hole but it's generally going to
63:47 displace the same amount because it
63:48 takes up the same space in space and
63:51 gravity is simply gonna be hey I can't
63:54 get through this thing okay what plasma
63:56 ball has the same exact property it
63:58 can't get through this thing now again
64:00 there might be a little bit of a
64:01 difference but it wouldn't be this big
64:04 sucking thing where everything gets
64:06 sucked into it that's my current deep
64:10 held belief it's why the Big Bang can't
64:13 happen because there's not enough ether
64:17 on the outside okay which is mass
64:19 pushing on this ball to make it super
64:22 duper tiny to the point has no gravity
64:24 at all I mean they're pushing Big Bang
64:26 in so many television products and movie
64:31 products it is insane let alone all the
64:34 crap you are on the internet and college
64:36 courses bill they'll actually reenact
64:38 college courses and I just saw that
64:41 Russian movie attraction on I think it's
64:45 Amazon Prime
64:46 it's a cool little weird reenactment of
64:49 the day the earth stood still sorta
64:51 without the earth standing still that
64:53 part doesn't happen but they filmed a
64:57 professor in some school and he was
64:59 talking about it you know and he was
65:01 talking about the singularity and no
65:02 mass and all this other stuff just
65:04 pumping it through now chances are the
65:07 writer believes what they're writing
65:09 into their script you just want to put a
65:12 scene in their script where they sound
65:15 like they're covering the bases of a
65:17 school and they want to have something
65:19 that sounds smart we're never gonna get
65:22 anywhere until we throw that crap out
65:23 move on so hopefully that was
65:25 entertaining and educational on some
65:27 level I hope that when you get to the
65:30 end of these episodes you feel driven to
65:33 reanalyze your universe to maybe do some
65:36 research and what's fun about it is I
65:39 will tell you even though science with
65:41 the capital S and flying quotes is
65:43 almost categorically the opposite of the
65:46 truth once you gain an understanding of
65:49 ether there all the simple techniques
65:51 I've given you in all these episodes
65:52 what's beautiful about it is you can
65:55 read all those incorrect papers and your
65:58 brain will automatically start
65:59 translating it to the truth or help a
66:02 lot closer to the truth than their stuff
66:05 theoretical papers why people are
66:07 confused about things they can get it up
66:09 to the point of having to acknowledge
66:10 ether and then they because they can't
66:13 acknowledge either they immediately the
66:17 paper you'll read a history I'll go and
66:18 they bailed out because they couldn't
66:19 get it any further had they endorsed
66:21 ether boom they would have gotten to the
66:23 next level if you haven't been to deep
66:26 thoughts radio Calm please go and
66:28 remember to subscribe hit the bell all
66:30 that kind of stuff because a lot of
66:31 people being unsubscribe
66:33 I kinda remember to say that now but we
66:35 have two options now for video and [ __ ]
66:38 shoe is just literally probably 24 hours
66:40 from being completely up to date with
66:42 the YouTube feed so if you want to see
66:46 episodes that have been turned off
66:49 I might it's funny I'll tell you gun
66:51 control again was banned worldwide on
66:53 YouTube for really no reason at all
66:55 and [ __ ] shoot it's my number one
66:58 episode
66:59 how do you like that how do you like
67:01 that there you go shadow banning is anti
67:04 shadow blending ha but we have a couple
67:07 different options but you know there's
67:08 all the the audio feeds are up there
67:10 just easy little links if you want go to
67:12 the device that you're going to listen
67:14 to the podcast on go to the website and
67:16 just click the link and it automatically
67:18 happens on your phone it's cool
67:19 no no technicality required we have two
67:25 social media outlets
67:27 we have Twitter which is just again the
67:29 feet of the videos it's getting passed
67:32 around quite a bit on Twitter which is
67:33 cool I mean for I would expect it to be
67:35 zero so it's not zero that's cool but on
67:39 the Facebook I want to reacquaint cuz I
67:41 it's been a while since I went through
67:42 it it's a locked Facebook group so you
67:44 can live in privacy unless your boss or
67:47 your family members join the group which
67:49 they won't no one will see what you're
67:52 talking about you have freedom to to be
67:54 cool now everyone's super cool on this
67:56 page I mean again we have evany and
67:59 ivory all over that page people believe
68:01 completely opposite things but they
68:02 treat each other with great respect and
68:04 it is a great feed all day long the
68:08 moderators Dave and Cass they work to
68:10 get you guys approved get your post
68:13 approved I participate as well when you
68:16 do join the group there's a question
68:18 basically so say something human and so
68:22 we want to make sure that you just say
68:24 anything just gobbledygook just you just
68:27 smash your keyboard that's fine but we
68:30 got to see that you're real now if you
68:31 forget and you look like you're real
68:33 we'll go to your profile page for a
68:35 split second take a look around make
68:37 sure you're not selling products anyone
68:39 who posts a product that's totally
68:42 unrelated that we're talking about
68:43 watches or purses you're out forever
68:46 you're blocked if I go to your page and
68:50 all you're doing is moving product and I
68:51 don't mean your own product or something
68:53 logical but something looks like it's
68:55 from some Chinese website you're not
68:58 gonna get in if you see people behaving
69:01 weirdly the moderators will take care of
69:03 this too but we we will clean it out we
69:06 really don't want any eyes on us that we
69:08 don't want so you know let us know the
69:12 other one is the little don't
69:13 link we've got PayPal for direct linking
69:16 I'm actually getting a lot more PayPal's
69:18 from [ __ ] shoot now which is pretty
69:19 cool so for all of those that donate I
69:22 can't find out your name so you're as
69:24 far as I know you're completely
69:25 anonymous
69:26 so I I want to like reply to someone and
69:29 say thank you but there's nothing so if
69:31 you want have complete anonymity when
69:33 you donate that's the case I've been
69:36 putting people in the credits who have
69:38 been donating so if I could ever find
69:39 anyone's name I'll put you put you in
69:41 there so I apologize if you're not in
69:43 the credits but you've been donating
69:45 your hard-earned money but anyone gets
69:46 on patreon patreon is cool because you
69:49 get the links sometimes days ahead of
69:53 time if I'm doing a double feature on a
69:55 particular day you may not get the
69:57 double the second one before it's ready
70:00 because I'm kind of rushing and I just
70:02 want to get throw everything out the
70:03 door but at least 80% of the time you're
70:06 going to get it before everyone else so
70:07 there's a little benefit for you plus
70:08 you're getting the credits which is cool
70:10 there is a piece of software called
70:16 Backblaze I use it it's 5 bucks a month
70:19 infinite backup on two systems with 5
70:21 bucks it is again saved my bacon you're
70:24 gonna hear this a couple times one it
70:26 just wants you on it because it is the
70:28 cheapest cloud service I've ever found I
70:30 don't know if it's deep staining on him
70:32 who knows anything that transmits over
70:33 the Internet's they got a copy of it
70:35 probably anything on our computers they
70:37 got a copy of it and we'd have to have
70:38 some awesome new security os if we want
70:41 to live in total blackout phase and
70:44 there's the brave internet browser which
70:48 is based on chromium which is another
70:51 sort of open source browser which I
70:53 don't believe has any association with
70:54 Google but they block all your traffic
70:57 they block all of the the ads trying to
71:00 play on your browser they block all the
71:02 movies that try to autoplay but the
71:05 coolest thing to do is they block the
71:06 trackers and the trackers are where they
71:09 stitch together your profile online so
71:11 if you don't want to have a virtual
71:14 profile of yourself constantly updated
71:16 about what products you buy what
71:18 websites you view whether you're
71:19 conservative or liberal or whatever
71:22 brave browser is awesome and even keeps
71:25 track of your
71:26 it's saved by using their browser
71:28 because they they know how long things
71:30 we're going to take the load and they
71:32 just keep adding that in there and so
71:33 you can see it so after six months of
71:35 use you will have saved tens of
71:38 thousands of minutes of you know loading
71:41 time so that's super duper cool and of
71:44 course if you're on the YouTube channel
71:46 if you're a bit shoot this isn't the
71:49 case but shoot has all season one on it
71:51 but if you're on YouTube on this
71:53 particular channel you'll look for
71:55 YouTube or you look for my videos in
71:56 season one which is basically one
71:58 hundred to number one they're not on
72:01 here they're still active in an unlisted
72:03 fashion so if you've ever embedded them
72:05 on your webpage you don't need to worry
72:06 about changing the link it still works
72:08 perfectly but I've created a remastered
72:11 season one took off all the custom
72:15 soundtracks which were causing me all
72:16 kinds of viewing problems as well as
72:19 monetary problems but the new channel
72:22 has no monetization whatsoever it
72:24 probably never will achieve that type of
72:26 viewership to ever be monetized so you
72:30 can get in and out really quick plus
72:31 I've probably removed I don't even know
72:34 probably a day's worth of pauses and the
72:36 videos so it's it's nice and clean
72:38 so it's cool I want to get you over to
72:39 see the best copy of everything as well
72:43 you're always welcome to give me ideas
72:45 for episodes there's a few ways you can
72:48 do that obviously patreon is the fastest
72:51 way to get it to me YouTube comments is
72:53 a little slower because there's
72:54 thousands of YouTube comments coming in
72:56 constantly the Facebook page is also a
72:59 decent one your best bet for me to see
73:01 your particular comment is if you were
73:04 to post an original comment in the
73:06 Facebook page that's going to get driven
73:08 down very quickly so if I miss the page
73:10 for four hours I may never see your
73:11 comment especially if one of the other
73:14 moderators approves it so the best thing
73:16 you can do is when you see an episode
73:18 that I've posted reply to the episode in
73:21 fact if you I think if you reply to any
73:23 of them it tells me it very specifically
73:25 someone so replied to your post and of
73:27 course I'm going to read it and I keep a
73:29 list on my computer of every potential
73:31 episode I could do I probably have 50
73:34 potential ones the problem is 48 out of
73:37 50 need a lot of research and
73:39 simply too busy to do all that research
73:41 so if you want me to cover something
73:45 very complex you may need to help me
73:47 produce that video so find me resources
73:49 if you have a four-hour video you want
73:52 me to watch do me a favor and maybe find
73:55 the minute marks that I'm supposed to
73:56 view to really get the scoop if I am
73:59 totally intoxicated by your suggestion I
74:01 will sit down and watch for hours to do
74:04 an episode for an hour and a half so
74:06 it's sort of hit-and-miss we'll see but
74:10 anyway I want to thank every single one
74:12 of you for joining the channel watching
74:14 the videos for those Alzheimer's who
74:16 have seen every single video and some of
74:17 them five or six times you're the boss
74:20 let me tell you so anyway until the next
74:23 episode take care of yourself and
74:25 someone else and I will see you in the
74:26 next deep thoughts over now
74:29 [Music]
74:30 [Applause]
74:32 [Music]
74:37 [Applause]
74:41 you
