00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today I want to talk about the
00:38 fundamentals of reality how do you know
00:42 this is a reality how do you know where
00:48 a five-cent system at a minimum and I
00:52 think that that's what we use SERP to
00:55 determine that oh no this one's real the
00:58 more you can see hear touch smell have
01:01 emotions the more that you believe that
01:03 you're alive right I teach my students
01:07 when I have them a little experiment in
01:11 looking at a photograph and it's sort of
01:13 a homework piece where I say okay here's
01:16 what you guys have to do if you can do
01:19 this with a friend or a family member
01:20 it's even better but someone prints out
01:23 a super duper high res 8 by 10 or bigger
01:28 or better picture or image of a relative
01:32 that has passed or a friend that has
01:33 passed a good picture picture you would
01:37 you would like to have you know just
01:40 continue the camera moment on you know
01:42 it's like oh my god it's a great moment
01:44 let's just live at Havasu or whatever it
01:45 is but it's got to be a very close up
01:47 face picture typically a portrait and
01:52 someone brings you up to the portrait or
01:54 holds it up to you got your eyes shut
01:56 you're behaving because you want the
01:57 experiment to go well and you open your
01:59 eyes and you feel yourself for the few
02:02 microseconds that it's going to occur
02:04 that you believe that person has entered
02:07 the room and that they're really there
02:08 and then you feel the Cascade of oh my
02:12 god they're not actually here now
02:14 sometimes we just do that with normal
02:16 photographs for people that are alive
02:17 they're simply in a different part of
02:19 the universe right you know they're
02:21 there in Boston and you're in LA but
02:26 when they're gone from their mortal coil
02:28 never to return it has a slightly more
02:32 profound effect and when you have
02:34 slightly more profound effects you get a
02:36 much bigger blip on the radar of your
02:39 consciousness then when that occurs you
02:41 can start to do some pioneering some
02:45 engineering inside your mind
02:47 right what was that oh my god I don't
02:50 know I felt something you did
02:52 where'd you feel it all right here what
02:53 a feel like well it kind of started off
02:56 like this and it did this and then it
02:57 did that and then it's over right eat a
03:00 really hot pepper you know you get
03:02 really excited about eating like a
03:04 habanero raw and then you smell it okay
03:08 doesn't really smell like much then you
03:11 start chewing it up and depending on how
03:13 sensitive you are you're not really
03:14 tasting anything it's kind of a floral
03:16 pepper like a green pepper and then all
03:19 of a sudden that he comes by boom it's
03:21 that sting II habanero heat you feel
03:24 like you're gonna die hey and then like
03:27 5-10 minutes later you're just swimming
03:30 in endorphins right if we don't have
03:34 large spikes in the system sometimes we
03:36 don't realize that it's happening how do
03:38 pickpockets work pickpockets work with
03:41 abruptly touching parts of your body
03:45 this is the really good ones and they
03:48 know that your brain is getting
03:49 overwhelmed with the power and
03:51 interpolation of being grabbed in your
03:53 se you see your watches over here on
03:56 your left wrist they're gonna grab your
03:57 right wrist really hard and then they're
04:00 gonna grab your left wrist a little
04:01 softer where you're really focused on
04:04 the section where they're grabbing you
04:05 really hard meanwhile they've got the
04:08 sleight of hand to pull a watch off a
04:10 belt off take your wallet out of your
04:12 pocket and they're always portraying
04:15 themselves says something safe well let
04:17 me just help you out here serve me just
04:18 step well you know you know gosh you
04:20 know you really look great today puh puh
04:21 puh puh them I got everything on you see
04:23 you later right
04:24 so when we want to figure out reality we
04:28 have to slow down our brains and start
04:29 paying attention to it a lot more than
04:31 we ever used to on a daily basis on a
04:33 second to second basis right virtual
04:36 reality it's come and gone once again it
04:41 won't
04:41 I don't think unless there's some
04:43 invention we haven't seen yet we won't
04:46 see any proliferation of VR and movies
04:50 like ready player one are going to look
04:51 like absolute relics once again art you
04:55 know augmented reality that will
04:57 continue a little bit longer than VR but
05:00 I think it's seriously
05:01 just going to be a nosedive into the
05:03 ground once again
05:04 you can't obstruct reality from people's
05:05 minds when they're crossing streets or
05:07 driving cars and therefore it is unsafe
05:10 to wear outside of a safe zone and that
05:13 just kills the utility so it's going to
05:18 be interesting the software is 20 years
05:21 behind the hardware and the hardware is
05:24 way behind in itself like every single
05:26 object in the universe is going to have
05:28 to be inside the computer so I have this
05:32 episode right why do it we're just gonna
05:34 meander around again about what is
05:36 reality I'm gonna try not to what I want
05:41 to get out in this episode is that it's
05:45 extremely sensitive as to what is
05:48 reality and what is in reality you know
05:51 the most of us have had a friend that
05:53 tries to hide out in how do we say this
05:59 in their bedrooms and they try to sleep
06:02 off their entire lives right young kids
06:04 do this all the time when they're sort
06:05 of in that rite of passage but then I
06:07 they don't have any ideas about how to
06:08 pull it off and so they just kind of sit
06:10 at home and sleep forever it's just
06:12 bizarre thing I did it really really
06:16 strange when I was a little little kid
06:17 I'd get up early watch cartoons mess
06:20 around it was not a problem about the
06:23 time I hit I don't know 13 14 years old
06:27 I would stay up really late programming
06:29 and drawing and painting and all that
06:30 kind of stuff but it would be dying
06:32 swear it didn't stay up that late and I
06:34 still just pull a 12-hour shift in my
06:36 bed my dad was military so he's like
06:38 what the hell are you doing you know get
06:40 your ass up one of the things that
06:42 fascinates me with people is that when I
06:44 talk to individuals that have dropped
06:46 acid for instance and they didn't have a
06:49 bad trip all right they weren't tiny
06:52 kids or something trying to do it with
06:54 some some jerk-off adult he's messing
06:57 with like an older brother or something
06:58 like that right when you're the more
07:01 mature you are when you take LSD and
07:04 again trulicity be very careful kids
07:06 people pawn off all kinds of weird [ __ ]
07:08 as LSD which it's not they have this
07:11 experience and they have this one with
07:14 the universe
07:14 first moment where everything connects
07:17 everything connects in the universe
07:20 right and they start to see the beauty
07:23 of how everything works they see love
07:26 they see God they they see God in the
07:29 form of like fingerprints
07:31 maybe footprints and it extends your
07:37 life and calms you down and then you do
07:39 not fear death I think I have just one
07:43 friend who's who's done a fair amount of
07:47 acid who still fears death it's very
07:49 interesting and he's not very religious
07:51 if I he's not religious at all isn't
07:53 that interesting I don't fear death you
07:57 know because I believe I'm just gonna
07:59 hop out of this universe and end up in
08:01 God's palm or something it's just an
08:04 inevitable thing that I've accepted at
08:06 this stage of my life maybe I get all
08:07 freaked out when I get older hopefully
08:08 not but what LSD does is it helps you
08:14 and I'm sure other drugs do too I don't
08:15 have a lot of experience with other
08:16 drugs but it definitely starts to open
08:21 you up to the fabric of where you are
08:25 the thing like about LSD is even though
08:28 it lasts a really long time it's
08:30 probably good for hours where you are
08:32 just we're doing whatever it's going to
08:34 happen to you and the rest of its all
08:35 just coasting down slowly it would be as
08:39 if you're skydiving and you know for
08:43 four hours the plane is going up and
08:45 you're looking out and it's just the
08:46 most amazing thing and then right around
08:48 four hours which is now hour into taking
08:50 it because it takes a little while to
08:51 start you know you get maybe like six or
08:53 seven hours even eight I'm just totally
08:56 coasting down in the parachute right and
08:59 you're completely in control you're not
09:02 ready to put your feet on the ground yet
09:03 but you're then you're coasting down
09:10 those moments are priceless when trying
09:13 to say well I'm so sure that reality is
09:17 this and then you're like whoa what was
09:19 that you know and acid doesn't hurt your
09:21 body that's the other thing too like so
09:23 we can make you stupid
09:24 and cocaine and heroin Jesus what can't
09:27 it do alcohol blows out your liver blows
09:31 out most your organs makes you fat give
09:36 you a DUI doesn't expand your
09:39 consciousness that's for goddamn sure
09:41 but LSD is like hay and people the folks
09:45 that want me to take DMT
09:47 hey I probably would I just don't have
09:50 anything so again anything that's it's
09:53 called the dream molecule DMT and it is
09:56 something that grows in all things they
09:58 typically extract it out of tree bark
10:01 and there's legal ways you can take it
10:04 in California but you have to be part of
10:06 a Native American tribe ceremony and a
10:10 friend of mine is taking it several
10:12 several times that it's very distracting
10:14 to have them running around doing
10:15 rituals and singing while you're trying
10:17 to have a very solitary moment with your
10:20 alien counterpart with DMT it's very
10:26 interesting I know a lot about it and
10:28 never taken it I've taken salvia which I
10:32 thought was a DMT based product but
10:33 someone recently told me that wasn't
10:35 true but boy that was a I was a
10:38 weird-ass experience as well but it's
10:42 interesting how loose the fabric of
10:45 reality can be once you start to change
10:48 your mind about it and I think that the
10:53 the misnomer that I have had on this
10:55 show
10:56 and my entire life might be this we
11:00 assume that if we change our reality and
11:03 our position in reality and our
11:05 definition of reality I start
11:06 experiencing more freedom that somehow
11:08 we're going to disturb this reality that
11:11 we sort of agree on right you're
11:12 watching the show we've seen to be in
11:14 the same reality like we're stopping off
11:16 at this island floating in space okay
11:20 but I think that if you were capable of
11:23 changing your opinion of reality and so
11:25 was i you're gonna change it in a
11:28 different way than I'm changing it
11:29 unless we're having a conversation and
11:30 we're deciding okay let's make green red
11:33 red green and they're gonna hit each
11:35 other at the next traffic stop but the
11:39 idea is if we went together maybe we
11:40 could go into a separate Alice in
11:43 Wonderland experience go through the
11:45 same mirror
11:46 hold hands but I think that what the one
11:51 thing that we are afraid to do is hurt
11:53 this reality we're afraid we got loved
11:56 ones in this reality and it's sort of
11:57 like it's sorta like the safe zone hey I
12:02 want to have a psychotropic experience
12:03 taking LSD okay well I don't want to
12:08 mess up my reality when I get back I
12:11 don't want to find out I'm half Fallout
12:12 4 and half you know Mario Brothers all
12:16 of a sudden right I want to keep this
12:18 reality intact as much as I possibly can
12:21 it's my safe zone the gurus of India say
12:25 you have a silver cord that holds you
12:27 down to your body as your spirit goes
12:29 out and experiences the universe hmm I
12:32 dig that but if that's so evident to
12:36 them why can't they give me a little
12:37 herb that goes oh my god I'm leaving my
12:39 body
12:40 salvia was pretty good salvia both times
12:44 brought in an alternate reality that was
12:46 phenomenal
12:47 I bought salvia which you can get you
12:50 know it's just like it's like smoking
12:51 sage it's really sour and gross but you
12:56 buy it in a level of potency 25% of 50
12:59 is 75 100 Creek gets increasingly more
13:02 expensive but you can buy a gigantic bag
13:04 of this stuff I heard it's still legal
13:06 but then I heard it was illegal and then
13:08 I heard it was legal whatever so how
13:10 about 25% because I was still yet to
13:13 drop acid and still yet to just be able
13:15 to know I can control an experience
13:17 right because you see these experiences
13:19 online with people smoke salvia and then
13:21 they just lose their mind they are off
13:24 to another location with DMT it's very
13:28 similar but DMT can only give you a trip
13:30 for maybe 15 minutes and you're back and
13:33 you're your body and you're doing well
13:35 but your body seems to get abandoned
13:37 so your soul leaves your body while
13:40 you're on DMT and your body sits there
13:42 in a feral animal state so what was
13:46 giving this gorilla whatever the hell we
13:50 are
13:51 it's intellectual power has left the
13:54 vessel and so the vessel just sits there
13:56 like it's on bath salts and it can be
14:00 violent and strange and it gets scared
14:01 almost right away so we may be a bunch
14:04 of different things mixed together right
14:06 but I smoke salvia the first time and I
14:09 felt this pipe going up through out of
14:12 my chest up through my chin through my
14:14 head and at the top of my forehead and
14:17 it felt like silver metal I mean that's
14:19 just I can't describe it any other way
14:22 then the second time I did it I smoked a
14:25 lot more you know talking short bursts I
14:28 smoked a lot more and I became the union
14:30 of two very elliptical spheres that were
14:33 grid like rotating in on each other and
14:37 again I was the union of the two and it
14:40 was I was like I was floating in some
14:42 old house room they had nothing in it I
14:45 was like maybe a 12 by 12 room just kind
14:48 of maybe it was white at one point but
14:50 now it's sort of patina'd out beige and
14:52 I'm sitting there just being the thing
14:56 that's between these two doodads right I
14:57 mean it's two ellipticals fears so very
15:00 strange right we talked about dreams a
15:04 lot on this show you are pioneering the
15:07 most amazing photo real stuff in your
15:09 brain on a on a whimsical basis just
15:12 today I'm gonna go to sleep boom Wow
15:14 alternate reality that that's a wake up
15:17 back in this reality hey you know and
15:20 that that bill is still sitting there
15:23 waiting for you even though you
15:24 completely went off to another universe
15:27 everything stayed the same the problems
15:30 that you have in life could be the same
15:33 you know I did make an episode back in
15:36 season one that you guys like dreams
15:38 there's a whole dream playlist that's
15:40 about dream scaping which is the notion
15:43 that you can go to sleep and wake up in
15:44 a slightly different reality it's not a
15:46 very altered reality it looks like this
15:49 feels like this but some of your stuff
15:51 some of your opportunities are there
15:53 that you've been waiting for and maybe
15:55 some of your problems aren't so hard
15:56 there's some solutions waiting for you
15:58 because you're tuning yourself when you
16:01 sleep how many times have you had
16:03 something touch your skin and it felt
16:06 like a bug and you went oh my god and
16:09 you flick it off and you realize it's
16:13 some piece of furniture it's touching
16:15 you your piece of clothing you have a
16:17 hoody and it's the tie they managed to
16:19 get over here and touch you your hair is
16:21 super long and it touches you it was
16:23 nothing but for that brief moment my god
16:26 there was a bug on you if you've had a
16:28 previous experience with a bug that was
16:30 bad
16:30 oh man you bring up that as those
16:32 emotions you relive that experience the
16:35 pain or the frustration one thing that's
16:40 interesting about cellphones and I'm
16:41 gonna harp on this just a little bit
16:43 more which is your eyes seem to dictate
16:45 so much of what you consider to be
16:49 reality right mine too
16:53 you put a headset on it's a virtual
16:55 reality even though it's crappy low-res
16:59 headsets within microseconds your brain
17:03 is going this is reality watch out for
17:05 that sofa first time I put on a HTC vive
17:08 headset the menuing system is you
17:12 floating in space on a glass platform
17:15 man it was scary I was thinking oh my
17:19 god if the guy drops this platform my
17:21 brain is going to buy into this reality
17:24 and I'm gonna be standing in a room
17:26 people watching me screaming like you
17:28 know Chris Hemsworth and Ragnarok as he
17:32 was strapped to the chair
17:35 so I think there's two parts of this of
17:38 this exercise one is the hardest part
17:41 which is to make yourself oversensitive
17:47 oversensitive to everything that you use
17:51 to believe that you are in reality why
17:54 are you in reality what's what's what's
17:56 making you think you're here is that the
17:59 fabric of the clothes on your skin is it
18:01 an injury in your body is it whatever a
18:04 smell some touch something something you
18:08 can see obviously all right now once
18:13 you've locked into this reality and some
18:15 folks are like I do this - its if you
18:19 want to study other realities your idea
18:21 may be a don't accept this reality don't
18:23 accept this reality therefore you can
18:24 see the other reality hmm it might be
18:27 the other direction totally get into
18:30 this reality and I mean understand it
18:33 why is that Rose over there the way that
18:36 it is it has the you know the Fibonacci
18:38 pattern because of the ether winds
18:40 swimming through some column
18:41 distributing all the atoms which then
18:43 eventually turn into their own
18:44 individual swirls which are biological
18:48 patterns which are petals get into it
18:51 understand this one immensely understand
18:55 why you basically buy into this reality
18:58 and then when you're hardcore into this
19:02 reality and you experience looking at a
19:05 movie on your cell phone you watch a
19:09 movie in a movie theater you close your
19:13 eyes in some place where music is
19:16 playing and you just listen and it's
19:19 taking you back to your past it's taking
19:21 to a whole new world I used to sit as a
19:23 kid and listen to John char the French
19:29 New Age guy and draw and I would just
19:33 less like Oxygene album and I'd sit
19:36 there and just let it become me same
19:39 thing with Tomita just let it become me
19:42 and I would I would literally see a
19:46 completely different universe
19:48 and it was beautiful now the other thing
19:53 is is that that let me give an example I
19:55 don't think any of you watch this show
19:57 even in 4k and feel like you're in the
20:00 backyard with me maybe you do but I
20:03 don't think because I put it in black
20:05 and white
20:05 it's very distinctly not your reality
20:07 right now when I watched old Twilight
20:10 zones sometimes I feel like I'm in that
20:13 reality if I watch like four or five in
20:15 a row I feel like God that black and
20:17 white world is just so enchanting the
20:19 way they shoot all these episodes it's
20:21 very cool but the heightened sensitivity
20:26 that you want to get to in my opinion is
20:29 no this reality really well and then
20:31 when stuff is different it's gonna stick
20:35 out like a sore thumb you go to sleep
20:38 and you have a dream and all of a sudden
20:39 you've got possessions you don't have
20:43 you can do something that you've never
20:45 done before and it's blissful and it's
20:48 like oh my god you know like I'm hoping
20:51 that people that have lost limbs or you
20:53 know our pair are paralyzed in some case
20:56 dream that they can walk I really hope
20:59 and run and just have a great time stand
21:02 up on their own two feet hugged someone
21:04 whatever it is that they don't want or
21:06 they show that they don't have anymore
21:07 that they they have a chance to do it
21:09 but that will be for them a profound
21:12 experience when they wake up oh my god I
21:14 was running I was walking I was swimming
21:16 whatever it's that level of sensitivity
21:19 that we need every day without suffering
21:23 any injuries then we get to the second
21:27 phase of the exercise which is let's say
21:29 that you guys are capable of doing this
21:31 you're starting to discover a bunch of
21:34 little nuances you know you can't really
21:35 write your PhD thesis on it just yet
21:37 because you're just getting started but
21:39 you're definitely starting to notice
21:40 things between dream between reality
21:42 when you watch TV and then you start to
21:46 realize oh it's interesting how I get
21:52 content that is giving me a sense of
21:56 alternate reality
21:57 what are those venues
22:00 our McLuhan okay well we got TV got
22:05 radio got your cell phone you got
22:10 amusement parks whole bunch of different
22:12 locations mini mall's big malls they're
22:17 all trying to get you to see a different
22:19 reality now when you put on virtual
22:20 reality augmented reality of course you
22:23 have a very in-your-face mechanism that
22:25 says just like Total Recall you know
22:28 don't you want to escape this reality
22:29 and wouldn't you rather be someone else
22:31 than the person that you are it's
22:34 interesting so why go through this
22:36 exercise right who gives a crap what
22:39 reality we're in right some people might
22:40 ask well what's death what is death you
22:46 know when you ask a scientist what is
22:48 death all you're gonna get is some
22:50 clinical answer based on really the most
22:55 remedial amount of information about the
22:58 human body that you could possibly put
23:00 in a box well it's when the heart stops
23:02 when the brain stops when the body
23:03 ceases to function what happens what's
23:07 really going on there mr. scientist and
23:09 what happens to me personally
23:11 will you die what's the definition of
23:13 die well you just cease to exist well
23:16 how can you prove that what am i exactly
23:19 oh you're just a bag of chemicals oh so
23:24 that means that you've got us completely
23:25 figured out right if we're bag of
23:26 chemicals the hell that should be easy
23:27 it's a finite amount of mass and energy
23:29 within a particular being all you gotta
23:32 do is run a bunch of experiments and
23:33 you're gonna completely forgot the brain
23:34 right mr. Kurtz well oh you've done that
23:38 and you still don't know dick about the
23:40 human brain
23:41 interesting interesting but we're so
23:44 sure
23:45 especially as laymen who've never had a
23:46 conversation or read a treta kurtzweil
23:48 book we're so sure we know what death is
23:51 hmm we're so sure we don't have souls
23:55 atheists oh my oh my you know II theists
24:01 attempt to defy those that they despise
24:04 thinking while the religious person is
24:07 absolutely hysterically built their
24:11 whole life on a foundation of
24:12 superstition and prophecy
24:14 and manipulation and I have gone to the
24:17 minimalistic no furniture in my house no
24:22 relationship with the universe
24:24 whatsoever besides the fact that I go
24:26 ashes to ashes dust to dust if I reverse
24:31 the polarity of them I immediately
24:32 become a genius mm maybe not Tonto maybe
24:37 not we're probably in the middle we have
24:41 a vessel it's our body then we have a
24:43 spirit that imbues it perhaps again
24:46 there's two different things DMT is a
24:48 very interesting experiment because it
24:50 seems to leave behind a carcass of your
24:52 very being while you are most definitely
24:54 in a different location from the
24:56 geniuses that I know that take it again
25:00 I told you my my friend is taking it the
25:02 most with a massive IQ and he's
25:04 extremely famous in the video game
25:06 industry he told me he won't take it
25:08 again because the alien being that
25:11 always becomes his host grabbed him on
25:15 the last visit put his forehead against
25:19 his forehead just kept his eyes right
25:21 inside his eyes and said don't come back
25:24 here like you're meddling in my world
25:28 when you take that drug and isn't that
25:31 interesting I don't think his body went
25:34 anywhere in the universe I think his
25:36 body was still in some attic and
25:38 Berkeley University but his spirit
25:43 hauled balls to wherever this creature
25:46 was and he said look I've taken in you
25:48 know a dozen times and I've always had
25:50 the same alien host this seems to
25:54 operate completely autonomous from
25:56 anything I could have assumed he was
25:57 going to do or would have you so I
25:59 really feel like he is in control of
26:01 himself he has his own unique being a
26:04 lot of people have reported the same
26:06 thing so without actually penetrating
26:11 this other any other reality in your
26:13 life once you find out that you are
26:16 truly a camera the way that you see
26:20 reality is
26:21 camera then it's whatever your it'll
26:24 staring at at any one point in time and
26:26 it's wherever you are or you awake or
26:28 you asleep are you on LSD or you're not
26:30 on LSD are you in an environment where
26:33 there's a tremendous amount of $0.05
26:34 input are you in an area where there's
26:37 only a couple inputs if you go get a
26:40 body massage from someplace you
26:41 typically have your eyes closed so
26:43 you're getting your whole life has
26:45 turned into sound which hopefully has a
26:47 nice soundtrack calming you down in
26:50 touch and someone touches you kaboom
26:54 you're having that feeling hopefully
27:00 every time I get a you know a massage I
27:04 sit there and I think you know it
27:07 doesn't matter how rich in this world I
27:10 could be if I have a good masseuse but
27:14 I'm sitting there thinking this is what
27:16 I would do if I was a trillionaire let's
27:19 have someone work on me and do a really
27:22 good job for about an hour maybe 90
27:24 minutes I leave the place and I'm just
27:26 like this jello zombie that's all I
27:30 would do as a to it you know to nurse my
27:34 health on a daily basis or what our
27:36 weekly basis has a very very rich person
27:39 to live like a king or a queen it's very
27:42 interesting so what I have found is this
27:46 once you start paying attention to the
27:49 nuances and differences of reality one
27:52 your grip on this reality starts to
27:55 loosen up now what happens to people
27:57 when they're about to die now seconds
28:02 before they die but you know a few years
28:04 before their mortality comes in place
28:05 some of them release themselves right
28:09 they're just like it's my time I don't
28:12 necessarily want to punch out right away
28:14 but you know my friends are gone my
28:17 spouse is gone all my relatives that are
28:22 older than me are gone so it's time for
28:25 me to go to I'm going to join them
28:27 wherever they went hey if there's
28:29 nothing there's pure blackness then you
28:31 won't be around to care about it so
28:32 don't worry about it right
28:34 but the interesting evolution I think in
28:37 the mind that hopefully we achieve as
28:38 men especially if we get some empirical
28:40 data about where we might be going is
28:42 the following Christians have told
28:46 themselves a story about a place called
28:47 heaven it has a wall around it that has
28:51 a gate and you got to do a bunch of
28:53 stuff to get inside oh and if you don't
28:56 go into that place within you go in this
28:57 other place deep down in some dungeon
28:59 and you're gonna burn alive that is a
29:02 super-duper massively ignorant but
29:05 well-meaning slice of this human
29:08 population trying to manipulate man into
29:10 doing the right thing for a little while
29:12 and then probably a bunch of other stuff
29:15 later but what if we could simply say
29:17 well it's a lot more abstract than any
29:20 one pearly gates and cloud9 and all that
29:23 stuff but there's a lot of stuff out
29:27 there some people get all worried about
29:30 things like well if we have Souls then
29:34 where do they come from
29:34 and I say what do you mean and they say
29:37 well there's always more people on the
29:39 planet every single day where do the
29:40 souls come from it seems like someone's
29:42 making more my answer is but there's
29:46 only one soul and it's us and that might
29:50 sound crazy but it's not when you hurt
29:53 someone else
29:54 you're hurting yourself in a different
29:58 instance of existence which is why it
30:01 never feels good to hurt someone else or
30:04 to lie to someone else because in the
30:05 end you're hurting yourself you kill
30:08 somebody well you're just killing
30:10 yourself that's why it feels bad most
30:12 the time right now maybe you get it
30:14 wrong maybe you're an [ __ ] hurting
30:17 people and you get yourself killed and
30:18 and then maybe even in your dying breath
30:20 of being Jack the Ripper you're like oh
30:22 thank you for saving me from being this
30:24 monster that I have turned into and then
30:27 those of you that did kill yourself as
30:30 Jack the Ripper you're like man I just
30:32 saved the world from from evil so it's a
30:34 beautiful balance there but we have time
30:37 in our brain right time says whether it
30:40 can all be one thing at one time it
30:41 can't be two things at the same thing it
30:42 won't let go
30:46 I go I want everyone to live in peace
30:52 complete peace of mind right obviously
30:56 there's the let's get rid of people that
30:58 are attacking people sort of thing but
31:00 that's different if you were to sit in
31:03 this patio by yourself and enjoy the
31:07 breeze and the beautiful flowers and all
31:09 this crazy vegetation I have around me
31:13 occasion by a harley-davidson screaming
31:17 by I want you to feel at peace with
31:21 yourself because there's all kinds of
31:24 things you can enjoy once you feel at
31:26 peace with yourself you could become a
31:28 better spouse a better parent a better
31:31 family member but a friend and if
31:34 nothing else you simply can live inside
31:36 your skin a whole hell of a lot easier
31:41 it's almost as if you're you and I both
31:45 are a I guess clay is a better way to
31:49 give an example of it but you know you
31:52 you form clay into something then you
31:54 fire it up and it becomes hard and
31:55 becomes who you are I think we're
31:58 through epigenetics we are actually a
32:01 big lump of clay our entire existence as
32:04 a metaphor but we allow ourselves to be
32:08 fired like in the kiln by political
32:12 parties right you're a Democrat you're
32:14 Republican and what was pliable clay
32:17 gets fired in the comb and we become
32:19 hard and brittle and sensitive and
32:23 scared but if we just pull out of that
32:26 whole game right pull out of that whole
32:30 game and relax a little bit
32:32 maybe we just stay us you know you can
32:38 recognize yourself as a human being you
32:40 don't have to you could just be a spirit
32:44 and a body
32:45 visiting you are a temporary human at
32:48 best in my opinion and once you start
32:52 waking up every single day and realizing
32:54 you are a temporary human so are your
32:57 kids so is your spouse so is your family
32:59 so
32:59 everyone you're walking around listening
33:02 to them piss and moan about one thing or
33:05 the other are being excited about
33:07 something very very relative to this
33:09 world it starts to become funny and
33:15 you're like wow look at us look how
33:18 we've built this reality we did and
33:24 somebody's really excited about getting
33:26 a an iPhone a new t-shirt a boat they
33:32 went to Athens and they had their mind
33:34 blown by the Parthenon okay that's great
33:38 that's cute
33:39 those are not unimportant things but
33:41 isn't it interesting to have a slightly
33:43 more global perspective on those things
33:47 if I told you again I made this example
33:51 one of my final episodes of season 3 if
33:55 I told you you know before we became
33:59 human it's just like the guys on the
34:00 train going to West world for the first
34:02 time and he's telling them how it's
34:04 gonna be
34:04 he says okay we're gonna get in these
34:06 avatars and we're gonna live a life
34:08 you're gonna be this little kid it's
34:10 gonna be crazy you're gonna have a hard
34:11 time walking and talking but you get to
34:13 have some boobies and pop up up a ba
34:15 then you're gonna grow up and you're
34:18 gonna know about this conversation
34:19 you're a whole existence on that planet
34:21 in the back of your mind you're like
34:23 this isn't real this is an avatar I am
34:26 inside some computer then what you see
34:29 feel touch touch and taste and the
34:32 context of all the events that happened
34:33 to you a bully on the on the playground
34:36 somebody honking at you driving down the
34:38 street how much does that stuff actually
34:40 piss you off you're in a video game
34:44 hmm I mean you want to win you want to
34:47 get as much stuff as you possibly can
34:49 you'll figure out your objective you'll
34:50 like him you'll like her
34:51 you get this career you don't like it
34:53 you like that one you blow through a
34:55 bunch of stuff and you're tired of it
34:56 you go on to the next thing but you do
35:00 have a better perspective right that's
35:04 what I want for you let's start off this
35:07 year the season the summer
35:11 with the notion that we're not so bound
35:15 ritualistically to our bodies that we
35:19 are really and I know that gurus have
35:21 much better ways of saying this kind of
35:23 stuff I haven't seen a group we're
35:24 talking probably 10 years but like a
35:28 good one but I see people so devoted to
35:31 this life and it seems as if the more
35:34 that they are what's actually
35:37 interesting
35:38 I see atheists who believe this is their
35:40 only run in life like if you're an
35:42 atheist the most interesting thing about
35:45 that is wow there's a lot of incredibly
35:48 unproductive unfulfilled atheists in
35:52 this world and if you thought this was
35:54 your only run in life I think it's
35:58 shameful
35:59 to live a life that you don't go
36:01 balls-out if you think this is it you
36:03 only you were just lucky to exist this
36:05 one time God Dan you should be I don't
36:09 know Einstein or Elvis like take your
36:11 pick or the female equivalent thereof
36:14 right but if you believe that there's
36:19 some sort of cyclical thing going on
36:20 here if you really just you think it's
36:24 one shot because they had to control
36:26 humanity but at least you live forever
36:28 in heaven based on your deeds here on
36:31 earth seems like the most asinine design
36:34 of a Supreme Being ever right yeah I'd
36:38 like to have a little pit stop area when
36:40 I get off the race I get to relax and
36:43 chill out a little bit meet some people
36:45 I've never met before see some old
36:47 friends that are passed sure but
36:49 eventually I want to get back in the
36:50 track and race if you're a race car
36:52 driver you race cars right the idea that
36:55 Christians say well you're just done
36:57 racing also I got really good at racing
36:59 yeah you know you just race one time you
37:02 get one chance to make all the mistakes
37:03 and fix them let you live forever but
37:07 what sort of structure do we put in
37:08 place when we realize that perhaps this
37:11 is a cyclical thing like every other
37:13 piece of energy in the universe
37:15 everything is cyclical
37:16 you know I water my yard that goes down
37:21 into the water mantle gets picked up by
37:23 a pump so back to me
37:25 and I water it again right everything in
37:29 the world recycles except for our
37:30 spirits and our souls and what we are in
37:33 the universe hmm as it is above so - it
37:36 is a below as it is in mass and energy
37:40 and ether so - it is in soul and spirit
37:46 and mind right how many of you guys have
37:51 tried to meditate and you can't you sit
37:54 in the room and you are like I am not
37:57 supposed to let anything interrupt me
37:59 not a sound not a touch anything and you
38:03 get into whatever lotus position you can
38:05 get into and it doesn't work because
38:07 you're just thinking about something
38:10 very specific in the room whatever now
38:14 I'm gonna say use that failure of
38:19 meditation as a success in the exercise
38:23 of this episode go somewhere sit
38:28 somewhere I don't give a crap if you're
38:30 in a chair or what-have-you and when you
38:33 try to hold still close your eyes and
38:37 feel and think you don't really have to
38:39 close your eyes and argue exercise but
38:40 no start off that way maybe as each
38:44 thing interrupts your ability to
38:47 meditate I want you to recognize what is
38:51 that sense because that is an input of
38:55 your current state of being in your
38:57 reality it is the thing we want to
39:00 become extremely sensitive to such that
39:05 when we start to use our minds to
39:08 penetrate other realities we can sense
39:11 those changes - like the picture thing
39:15 if you're used to using your eyeballs to
39:18 take in reality and then say I am here
39:20 I'm in a patio versus in a desert
39:22 sitting on a rock looking at nothing but
39:25 more desert when my brain is somehow
39:27 crafting this reality because it needs
39:31 to because the deserts really lonely
39:34 there's no one actually there and
39:36 everyone I've talked to it's just
39:38 it's just apparitions I used to have
39:42 this East have this vision of someone in
39:45 the desert and when you look at their
39:49 world it's just a bunch of footsteps
39:51 everywhere it's a bunch of paths they're
39:54 completely safe whatever reason they
39:56 don't need to eat and so they're
39:58 imagining all of this constantly and you
40:01 see someone who's 80 years old and they
40:03 have a thousand pass they've taken if
40:05 they thought they got into a plane and
40:07 went somewhere their mind is seeing the
40:12 desert with rocks and things and so on
40:14 they need to sit in the chair
40:15 their brain pauses everything and makes
40:18 the cab this way and that long so that
40:20 when they sit down in the chair they're
40:21 sitting on a rock
40:22 you know how many times have you this is
40:27 just more metaphorical physical examples
40:30 here but how many times have you thought
40:31 you had one page from a book in your
40:34 hand or one page of paper in your hand
40:36 and then you suddenly started looking at
40:40 it and thinking oh my gosh maybe it is a
40:43 little thicker than normal away and you
40:46 start picking on it picking on it
40:48 picking on all sudden oh [ __ ] it's two
40:50 pieces of paper stuck together wow I
40:53 never knew thought it was one that
40:57 parsing exercise is what we're trying to
41:02 do to our perception of every single
41:04 sense we have in our body
41:07 be aware again that your thoughts aren't
41:10 necessarily all from your invention you
41:13 do not have to accept them simply
41:14 because you have seen them or heard them
41:16 you could be hearing echoes from friends
41:18 in the neighborhood hey if we exist as a
41:22 symbiotic relationship with this being
41:25 that when we take DMT we seem to leave
41:27 this being behind scared and stranded
41:29 before we return what would stop there
41:35 being a race of beings that is purely
41:40 spirit spiritual that maybe feeds on us
41:43 like a barnacle feeds off of a whale or
41:48 a ship you know puts itself on there and
41:51 it uses the car
41:52 of the water to get whatever it needs
41:54 well couldn't there be barnacles on us
41:57 from the outside in the spiritual realm
41:59 that's simply saying make make more
42:03 anger because that tastes delicious and
42:06 because I am sort of a babel fish into
42:09 your brain this thing it could you know
42:12 oh yeah you should worry about that you
42:15 should worry about this see what I'm
42:18 saying once you start to parse out your
42:24 feelings and figure out well when you
42:26 speak there's something magical that
42:28 goes on especially if you're in a calm
42:31 state of mind when you speak it is
42:34 really who you have built yourself up to
42:37 be as almost the summit of your
42:40 expression and your thought now you can
42:42 be very angry inside your heart let's
42:44 just say and control the way that you
42:47 bring out and funnel everything together
42:50 to create the reality perception of who
42:53 you are but if you want to somehow
42:58 mediate these the whirlwind inside your
43:01 chest inside your mind of all the
43:03 different emotions because I have them
43:05 constantly right I'm sure you do too
43:07 you're in your work environment you have
43:09 a whole different batch of feelings and
43:12 thoughts that you don't have when you're
43:14 in your home environment when you're
43:16 with your loved one versus just cleaning
43:19 out an old garage right well it might be
43:22 the case and something I want to leave
43:24 you guys with is that perhaps because
43:28 actually rewind one second the idea is
43:31 how come we're so bound to this reality
43:34 I mean it does seem like this is the one
43:36 and everything else is just a figment of
43:39 your imagination right you're
43:41 daydreaming your dreams but this one's
43:43 hardcore where my finger gets cut off it
43:46 hurts like a son-of-a-bitch you know my
43:49 current thinking on this is the
43:50 following because our energy that is us
43:54 which I would say we can call a soul or
43:57 spirit it is adhering to this body
44:05 and so by adhering to this body it
44:07 adopts this reality it is using these
44:11 eyes and these ears to see and hear
44:16 reality it's using this body for touch
44:18 and taste and smell there are chemicals
44:22 in your brain that will affect how you
44:27 filter the sensory input which is always
44:31 coming in in various forms of concussive
44:36 shockwaves to your senses and your
44:38 sensors and your body and turn into
44:40 electricity to be metabolized right but
44:43 if we simply understand that we are a
44:45 probably a genderless being inside this
44:48 vessel adopting all the paradigms of
44:51 reality in this particular world but
44:54 that when we sleep when this thing goes
44:56 to bed right you know you can't stay at
44:59 Disneyland 24 hours a day it shuts down
45:02 and then it restarts and it's about an
45:04 eight-hour stretch okay that's when
45:07 you're supposed to be in bed you release
45:09 yourself you got to go relax why I have
45:15 no idea when we do release we dream
45:17 because now no longer are we attached to
45:20 this body the body is sitting there
45:21 breathing the deepest breaths it could
45:24 possibly breathe the fact that the
45:26 breathing patterns largely dictate how
45:30 the consciousness works it's a very
45:31 interesting reality that a lot of
45:33 scientists have figured out a lot of
45:36 hypnosis has to do with breathing
45:38 exercises and it's weird you can just
45:40 breathe in a certain rhythm as long as
45:41 you can hold that rhythm a lot of people
45:43 could put themselves to sleep
45:45 they're completely conscious and not
45:47 tired at all when they start this
45:49 exercise but they'll just go take a deep
45:51 breath and just push it all out
45:53 deep breath push it all out push it all
45:56 and they just start getting tired
45:57 because the body is trained pavlo nyan
45:59 lee to interpret things like that why is
46:03 it that we can daydream when we are in
46:05 this body
46:06 that's daytime what happens when you
46:10 daydream what you physically do in the
46:13 world when you daydream you will sit
46:17 there
46:18 and you will look at the wall or look
46:20 out a window or look at your desk and
46:22 you will take the focal point of your
46:24 focus which is has been up to that point
46:28 focused on this reality your eyeballs
46:31 have been focusing on objects in the
46:32 room and then all of a sudden you have
46:35 the 60-foot 60,000 foot stair in one
46:38 direction you're no longer focused on
46:40 anything in this room Oh interesting so
46:46 we change the focal point of the
46:49 eyeballs and then we have the ability to
46:51 imagine mm-hmm
46:55 interesting right I don't know if we can
46:58 do that to our ears
46:59 maybe the Bionic Woman could so most of
47:03 us serendipitously have a moment of
47:06 imagination unless you're a writer or an
47:09 artist but let's face it
47:12 writers and artists are fairly rare I
47:16 mean it's not hard to find them but if
47:19 they're definitely not the over 10% of
47:22 the population slice of reality so most
47:25 of most of us allow those things to
47:28 happen serendipitously oh I just had a
47:30 daydream
47:32 well why don't you turn that into a tool
47:34 to to exercise your ability to change
47:39 reality how many of you when you put
47:41 your bet head down it at night on your
47:44 bed you have these just swimming super
47:49 intense super fluidic daydreams of
47:52 things that if either occurred haven't
47:54 occurred but it's going a million miles
47:56 a minute within within a second and a
47:58 half you're able to perceive a complete
48:00 reality living it for a little sight a
48:02 minute or two and be out of it again
48:05 imagining history is in making it
48:07 validating in your brain as if it really
48:09 happened to you and then finding out
48:11 four seconds later that all that's just
48:13 imaginary never happened all right
48:19 well there's a I use that as like almost
48:23 an oasis I'm laying down I'm committed
48:25 to sleeping if my brain is swimming
48:28 around like crazy
48:31 I've got a place that I've gone for
48:33 vacation that I can mess with it's my
48:37 oasis away from a reality or it's my
48:41 backdoor like the movie Tron from 1982
48:43 they broke the wall of the game grid and
48:46 three light cycles escaped a game grid
48:49 it's like characters from a book
48:51 escaping the bounding paperwork of the
48:55 book itself becoming self-realized now I
49:02 don't think that we have to escape this
49:03 at all but maybe one of the next
49:06 evolutionary steps of mankind is to
49:09 start realizing that we're symbiotic
49:12 that we merely possess this vessel as it
49:15 grows we take good care of it we should
49:18 always take good care but we should help
49:19 others take care of theirs help them
49:23 heal themselves etc but in the end we
49:27 shouldn't be grown shouldn't grow so
49:28 utterly attached to this that we want to
49:34 stay here and not go anywhere else but
49:37 does that mean we lose our burial
49:38 rituals hell no because we respect
49:41 individuals that we had access to now
49:44 currently if your grandfather passes
49:46 away unless you see ghosts you can only
49:50 assume that maybe your grandfather is
49:52 there for you you know maybe you feel
49:54 some intuition maybe there's some signs
49:56 but you won't be able to grab them and
50:00 put them back in a body and the only
50:02 time you're going to see them in any
50:03 full form that they're in after they die
50:05 is when you die out of your body and you
50:08 basically transition and transcend into
50:10 whatever form he or she went into when
50:15 you can commune again I guess the gist
50:17 of this episode is loosen up loosen up
50:21 your grasp on reality
50:22 I'm not saying become irresponsible or
50:25 anything like that but loosen up the
50:27 tightness that is trying to hang on to
50:31 this really intensely and there might be
50:34 a fraction of people who are sort of out
50:36 of their mind and they could actually
50:37 use a few hands on the guardrails I'm
50:39 probably not talking to them some people
50:43 might be living literally
50:44 on the razor's edge between this reality
50:47 and some other reality and they just
50:48 seem crazy I want to put this episode
50:51 out before the year the next 12 months
50:53 occurs because I think there's a been a
50:56 lot of research in this area I think
50:58 there's going to be some epiphanies
50:59 coming out of the scientific community
51:02 as we do play with reality one more time
51:05 I think it's going to be it's gonna be a
51:11 good subject to talk about you know the
51:13 Great Awakening is a small smidgen of
51:18 this sort of thing is to question
51:20 reality a little bit and so I feel like
51:24 we're gonna keep a little heartbeat on
51:26 this throughout the show this won't be
51:28 that obviously a heavily discussed topic
51:31 but hopefully there's a few things in
51:32 here that when you live your life you're
51:34 gonna go oh yeah yeah I should probably
51:36 try that thing you know let's let's
51:37 meditate and then get all frustrated
51:39 that things are messing with me but
51:40 study get frustrated I'm going to
51:42 measure that input of distraction and
51:46 recognize it in the five sense category
51:49 of reality and if you can come up with 6
51:51 7 8 9 10 12 whatever do that to
51:56 hopefully you feel me if you haven't
51:59 been too deep thoughts radio.com please
52:01 go it has the audio of the video a
52:04 patreon account a locked Facebook group
52:06 and probably an expired store link which
52:10 will get re fitted I didn't have a lot
52:13 of time to work on it this summer I took
52:15 my month break at one point you know you
52:17 just think about the shell you think
52:18 about the show and then you've got to
52:21 execute and so I just made the decision
52:23 two days ago it's like okay it's time to
52:25 roll get the camera or shoot this thing
52:26 and get rolling so we are rolling all
52:31 right take care of yourself and someone
52:32 else that I'll see you in the next deep
52:34 thoughts over now
