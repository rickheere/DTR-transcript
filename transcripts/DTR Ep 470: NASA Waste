00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:32 this special episode at the Bulldog
00:35 cigar lounge
00:37 it's a threatening rain here and there
00:39 we just had a little bit of rain so I
00:42 felt like doing a show it's not too late
00:45 this room's perfect if it rains we'll
00:48 hear it be good last time I did a show
00:51 up here I think it was the one on the
00:54 vacuum which sadly was uploaded at 4k
00:57 but our friends at YouTube accidentally
01:02 wouldn't encode it anything above like
01:04 the most basic 480p so hopefully this
01:07 one will encode a lot better so I'm
01:10 thinking about sort of you know what to
01:12 discuss been really feeling like you
01:15 know sort of addressing the NASA issue
01:18 but I'll be really straight with you I
01:20 mean it's after so many episodes on NASA
01:24 and you know we pick it apart baby I
01:26 mean from the space station to the past
01:29 launches you know I've come at it from
01:33 so many angles psychological languages
01:35 are Inc puh psychological angles
01:39 psychological languages that's kind of
01:42 interesting here yeah we you know coming
01:45 from so many angles that I know we just
01:50 love shooting the breeze about it so you
01:53 know at this point I'm just gonna kind
01:55 of do at NASA odds-and-ends
01:57 update from what I'm seeing because for
02:02 my money they've been very quiet lately
02:03 they really have been quiet lately they
02:06 I think they know that Trump is on their
02:09 ass with space force and so space force
02:12 you know we know very little about it if
02:14 we probably will always know very little
02:17 about it until we see them do something
02:20 cuz it's all military which is great and
02:24 now we know hey when space force does
02:27 something and it's all covert it's cuz
02:29 the space force now what are you gonna
02:31 do NASA that's what I am dying to see so
02:35 you know I know that a lot of you think
02:38 you
02:38 trumpets on the inside I would say he is
02:42 so on the inside that he has failed to
02:45 ever be a part of their parties or their
02:48 functions on any any level than other
02:51 than someone wanting to shake his hand
02:52 at one of his own events but he's the
02:57 one pushing NASA to go back to the moon
02:59 he's pushing him to go to Mars all
03:02 because I think he's trying to sucker
03:06 them into exposing themselves now you
03:11 might think oh well the president United
03:12 States as soon as you become president
03:14 they tell you everything and therefore
03:17 they know about all the lies and I would
03:19 say that is probably categorically the
03:21 opposite of what exactly happens they
03:25 try to muscle you to do what you're told
03:29 if you are a normal citizen like Obama
03:33 you're gonna just nod your head and feel
03:35 privileged that you've ever gone from a
03:37 nobody to a somebody and now you're in
03:39 charge of technically perception-wise in
03:42 charge of the most powerful country in
03:43 the world with our successors being
03:47 close behind I don't mean to poopoo
03:50 anyone elses power structure abilities
03:53 well but Trump I think it's a completely
03:55 different game which is why they never
03:57 wanted him in there because they know he
03:59 would never cow down right but NASA what
04:06 is there we're gonna put my history what
04:11 does NASA claim to be the experts at
04:15 right well they have had a free pass
04:18 since the moon missions and it's not
04:20 they've been sitting on their ass okay
04:22 the Space Shuttle was invented it did go
04:25 up in the air is illogical as that
04:26 device was to launch payloads into space
04:29 I guess the only thing was that to get
04:34 payloads unloaded properly pointed in
04:37 the right direction we needed to
04:38 actually have a vehicle get it to the
04:40 orbit altitude orbital altitude and then
04:44 it gets put in a space now by design
04:47 it's just an orbit it's where ever it's
04:49 going to be flat around doesn't
04:50 or whatever's holding up everything else
04:52 is holding up this object and then human
04:55 being is kind of you know twisting and
04:56 turning making sure a telescope lands go
04:59 straight down on us a weapon whatever
05:02 right the only thing I have seen NASA
05:06 involved with in terms of the press
05:08 recently have been those you know doom
05:12 and gloom articles they buy to keep
05:15 their budget going right to manipulate
05:17 the population into completely
05:19 supporting them now what's interesting
05:20 about NASA is that the citizens of the
05:24 United States never ever vote for NASA's
05:27 budget it isn't that interesting it's
05:32 not like a weird line item somewhere
05:35 where you know we're paying for
05:37 duplicitous bureaucracy like Trump
05:42 getting rid of the agency that was
05:43 trying to block poachers bringing back
05:47 ivory from Africa because now Africa has
05:51 those layers of protection and now we
05:54 have moved that responsibility from that
05:57 dedicated agency into customs so Customs
06:00 has been given you know billions and
06:03 billions of dollars to upgrade their
06:04 games so it's duplicitous you don't need
06:06 both functions and so of course the left
06:09 took that and ran with it Oh Trump wants
06:11 to kill a bunch of big-game animals and
06:13 Psyche [ __ ] hope you rot in hell for
06:16 making all these goddamn you know false
06:18 assertions but with NASA a 60 million
06:23 dollar a day budget should be something
06:26 that the American people vote on we
06:30 should we should vote on all budget
06:33 measures over a particular threshold of
06:37 cash and I would think quite frankly
06:40 anything that's grabbing a billion
06:43 dollars a year or more should have to be
06:46 voted on and those organizations should
06:48 have to make presentations with
06:50 accountability to gain our support now
06:56 what would that do well would the
06:58 difference be if we were able to vote on
07:00 these things well the big one would be
07:04 those organizations couldn't remain
07:06 clandestine secret GPL wouldn't be able
07:11 to say we'll [ __ ] you I don't have to
07:13 tell you anything about what I'm doing I
07:14 don't have to prove anything that I'm
07:16 claiming you just you're just gonna pay
07:18 for my [ __ ] and you know go back to your
07:22 bridge game or whatever it is right what
07:25 a 70s reference that was and what's
07:28 interesting about it if you think that's
07:29 absurd the funny kind of non absurdity
07:32 of it is that how do you run a
07:35 corporation how do you want a
07:38 corporation
07:39 how would you run any institution
07:41 whatsoever I was talking to my friend
07:43 who's running for the Senate I was
07:46 telling her you know analogies are
07:49 extremely powerful because it gets
07:50 everyone to kind of go oh yeah you know
07:53 that's [ __ ] and the knowledge I gave
07:57 her cuz she's gonna be you know having a
08:00 position on border control because
08:02 everybody has to have a position but I
08:04 said you know what organization in the
08:08 world is run like the United States
08:10 southern border what organization runs
08:14 like that full [ __ ] chaos man you
08:17 know you got human trafficking you got
08:19 people saying you know good Mexican
08:21 citizens just want to come over here and
08:23 work and start a new life and these
08:24 coyotes give them big old kilos of
08:27 cocaine or whatever and they're running
08:29 across and what a patrol can kill them
08:32 after they're given their warning these
08:34 people don't know they don't even know
08:35 that that's a consequence half the time
08:37 right because they come from deep deep
08:38 in the south where you realize there's
08:41 some people in Mexico they've never seen
08:42 a car it there are locations like that
08:47 right when my buddies like I said
08:49 watched a woman get hit by one and they
08:51 just could tell her out of the bat she'd
08:53 never seen one she'd know to get out of
08:54 the way of it right she sat there
08:56 watching him go by and was like it
08:58 startled anyway but yeah this situation
09:03 where after person comes across the
09:05 border you have just this random number
09:08 of people to come across the border
09:09 random number of services that are given
09:12 to them health care Social Security just
09:15 it just you have a random balance sheet
09:17 well what is
09:18 pl your your profit and loss sheet well
09:20 [ __ ] I don't know why well because my
09:22 loss sheets complete chaos
09:24 well the profit yeah it's all the other
09:26 indigenous citizens that fought and died
09:29 for this country unlike those that are
09:31 coming over won't fight for their own
09:33 country it's just a [ __ ] random
09:37 crapshoot so nothing in the world runs
09:40 like the southern border of America no
09:43 organization you know I gave her the
09:46 analogy I said I want you just compare
09:47 it to a college well if a college any
09:50 college and the University in the world
09:51 was run like the southern border of
09:52 America it would be random students
09:55 coming they randomly show up to class
09:57 they randomly not study or study or
10:00 whatever they get all the free housing
10:02 and dorm rooms and free lunches and all
10:05 this other stuff they don't necessarily
10:06 have to just to graduate they're
10:10 disrupting all the other citizens that
10:12 are trying to actually you know get a
10:14 degree in focus oh and you can kill one
10:18 of the students by the way you can reap
10:19 one of the students by the way and you
10:20 know democratise let you go do it again
10:22 just nuts so take that little analogy
10:26 and we're back to NASA okay sixty
10:31 million a day what are you doing for
10:35 that kind of money because sixty million
10:37 a day that's six hundred college degrees
10:43 a day if the kid got a hundred thousand
10:48 dollar degree which is a fairly
10:51 expensive degree you can get them for
10:53 less than that
10:54 but a hundred thousand dollar degree
10:57 times six hundred is what NASA's
10:59 consuming on a daily basis you know
11:03 there's all this white privilege
11:05 horseshit going on and privilege this
11:06 and privilege that NASA's made of all
11:08 races by the way well what are we doing
11:12 we're just paying for a bunch of
11:14 privileged people to [ __ ] around with no
11:16 commitment to the American people or the
11:18 world as to what the hell they're doing
11:20 hey don't give me this [ __ ] now
11:23 you're launching a bunch of secret
11:24 satellites for these you know these
11:26 black hats you're not doing anymore you
11:30 know why SpaceX is going to take care of
11:32 that
11:32 and maybe our space force in the SpaceX
11:35 will do the launches okay what are you
11:38 doing now you don't have a shuttle
11:40 anymore because you let that thing
11:42 atrophy so bad that we had two of them
11:46 blow up hmm so their cover story to get
11:53 them a little you know it's always some
11:54 [ __ ] life
11:55 person who's a liar just keeps lying
11:57 till they get to the next stage of the
11:59 scam then when they get caught they pack
12:00 up their [ __ ] and they take it to an
12:02 area of the world that no one knows the
12:03 scam and they run it again I just
12:06 watched a video on YouTube about stolen
12:09 valor and this dude was busted by ABC
12:13 Australia and what he was doing he
12:16 actually came clean on Anderson Cooper
12:18 show which I at least celebrate him for
12:22 that his excuse was kind of strange said
12:26 he was mentally ill false you know
12:28 undiagnosed mentally ill and maybe is I
12:30 don't know but what he was doing is he
12:34 would set up he would go to gathering
12:37 steam keep looking in the paper and he'd
12:38 set up a tent with a bunch of
12:40 collections for various military
12:42 branches movements collect a bunch of
12:45 money you know tell people he's gonna be
12:49 in another location pack up the stuff
12:50 and change his whole store and go to the
12:52 next organization like make up another
12:54 thing okay so what's what's NASA doing
12:58 lying about going back to the moon first
13:01 they never been there that's the problem
13:03 they don't know how to get there they
13:05 have no platform to get to the moon zero
13:08 man and then they're gonna supposedly do
13:11 one it's a thousand times more difficult
13:13 than a million times more difficult
13:15 which is go to Mars so the the we've got
13:21 a bunch of new listeners and so I'm
13:24 getting some questions that I've
13:25 answered in episodes so let's just say
13:28 you haven't gone back to watch those
13:31 episodes my position is very clear on
13:36 Mars because of bidding Mars questions I
13:37 think people understand very quickly I
13:39 don't believe we went to the moon for a
13:42 million reasons I've documented I
13:46 we've never been to Mars necessarily I
13:49 think that we have taken amazing perhaps
13:53 telescope shots of Mars that we haven't
13:55 seen which gives them the ability to
13:58 sort of create a facsimile of it that
14:01 will sort of maybe be more accurate than
14:04 anything that we've seen with telescopes
14:06 of Mars officially without you know
14:09 orbital reconnaissance satellites but I
14:12 think the whole thing is a picture game
14:15 they launch a rocket into into out of
14:18 well but out of your sight right goes
14:20 over the Atlantic Ocean you don't see it
14:23 anymore the [ __ ] thing could be
14:24 splashed on the ocean ten minutes later
14:26 but they're telling you this fantasy
14:28 that this thing can suddenly escape the
14:31 Earth's gravitational force which is an
14:33 absolute joke and you know slingshot
14:36 which the slingshot theory of just for
14:38 my for my own personal intellectual
14:41 capacity to understand it it makes no
14:44 sense
14:45 physically because you must introduce a
14:47 constant power source behind a vehicle
14:50 to achieve every split second of the
14:55 slingshot theory you cannot stop the
14:58 booster as you always see on a SpaceX
15:00 launch and they're not saying well
15:02 actually they do say they're sending
15:03 stuff out into space don't you have to
15:06 introduce more power because you have to
15:08 increase the elliptical orbit of a
15:10 vehicle to then take advantage of the
15:13 last second which is your last orbit to
15:15 the in slingshot you still have to hit a
15:17 motor to break out of the slingshot or
15:19 otherwise you just have a really big
15:21 orbiter on earth and you know slam into
15:23 Earth eventually none of that stuff has
15:25 ever been prophesized let alone
15:27 documented for us so it's all [ __ ]
15:30 so they never go there and they send you
15:35 pictures pictures from Greenland Picchu
15:38 pitch I mean I've seen some pictures
15:39 from the dude who travels it all around
15:43 the world he traveled in Iran in Iraq
15:44 and he was filming these mountainsides
15:47 and I'm sitting there going Jesus those
15:49 things look exactly like the marsh shots
15:51 just snap it put it in Photoshop knock
15:53 it down to a rust color you know
15:56 Photoshop and he you know electrical
15:58 poles or whatever
15:59 modern things out of there you know some
16:01 road or something and you got Mars but I
16:04 also talked to the two guys who worked
16:06 on Tron they work for JPL for 13 years
16:09 and they made what terrain simulation
16:12 software for Jet Propulsion laboratories
16:15 when asked him what for they didn't
16:17 really have an answer it will discuss
16:19 man I said well how good is it he goes
16:21 it the more memory you have we can do
16:24 every grain of sand I was like done
16:27 like I've said recently one of the coup
16:31 de Grasse to NASA's whole narrative of
16:34 having all these accomplishments post
16:36 the moon mission but even the moon
16:38 missions with 2001 a Space Odyssey
16:40 pretty much pioneering every technique
16:43 they needed to use to fake the moon
16:45 missions although they did a butcher job
16:47 you know the one reason why you know
16:49 Stanley Kubrick wasn't a part of the
16:51 moon mission landings is that the shots
16:53 are so shitty Stanley would have
16:55 probably cut his own throat of hitting
16:56 had he ever been responsible for those
16:58 shots but it's every advancement in
17:02 special effects in Hollywood coincides
17:05 with NASA's capabilities in some cases
17:07 NASA goes after special effects groups
17:11 are reveal but nowadays NASA goes first
17:15 and then it is given to this
17:16 special-effects community or at least
17:19 they're allowed to make a movie out of
17:21 it once they kind of use it up or they
17:23 got better technology at NASA
17:25 headquarters but I'm also getting a lot
17:28 of pushback on my research with Vivian
17:33 Kubrick Stanley's daughter she was
17:37 gracious enough to let me become her
17:39 friend and we we'd have you know easily
17:42 for our conversations I mean these
17:44 aren't like he did your dad faked the
17:46 movie should absolutely not okay that's
17:48 all I need to know click it's not like
17:49 that it's going deep and deep and deep
17:52 into it but here's the thing and she's
17:58 allowed me to tell you this she had a
18:01 congenital issue that disappeared when
18:04 she was 9 but they kept monitoring it
18:07 for 12 and a half years I got the
18:09 numbers right she was essentially at her
18:12 father's side
18:14 virtually every single day of her life
18:16 for twelve and a half years on occasion
18:18 you know the schooling was always
18:20 brought to her she did go to school
18:22 every once awhile
18:23 way before any moon stuff was even
18:25 coming close to fruition but then they
18:28 finally just you know her father was
18:29 like you are special you have this you
18:31 know she did the soundtrack for Full
18:34 Metal Jacket if you know it's like she
18:38 just did that I mean she wasn't she's a
18:40 musician but it's like she didn't make a
18:42 huge career out of it but if you go
18:43 listen to that soundtrack you know we've
18:46 got the Fallout franchise copying it
18:48 every single day there's some other
18:50 video games that copy that
18:51 every day it's a landmark soundtrack so
18:54 this kids at the time she was a kid but
18:56 she was extremely talented but if he had
19:01 gone anywhere in the world to shoot
19:03 anything secret she would have been
19:07 there because she was at her dad's side
19:09 so for all of you don't want to believe
19:11 what I've told you about her breaking it
19:14 down for us even the shining explaining
19:17 every single piece of it you know it's
19:20 coincidence this kind of stuff happens
19:21 every once in a while she would have
19:24 been there she would tell you but again
19:28 you know she is extremely ethical person
19:30 and she's on our side guys she's
19:34 completely on our side with all this
19:37 stuff she's an activist every day she's
19:39 trying to get Julian Assange in a safe
19:42 place
19:42 you know before it's too late you know
19:46 but she thinks for herself and she's
19:48 very skeptical and she helps me be
19:49 skeptical this as sure as I am about
19:52 certain things she'll she'll put her
19:54 little intellectual wedge in there and
19:57 get me to kind of pull back a little bit
19:58 on some things you know but yeah this
20:02 organization that is milking us dry so I
20:08 was at a function a few weeks ago and I
20:12 met a gentleman who works for SpaceX
20:14 what's his job
20:16 special effects okay yeah most of us on
20:21 the show just went hahahaha isn't that
20:24 hilarious right
20:27 now what's funny about is very
20:31 intelligent guy
20:33 he started I even wanna say anything you
20:36 know he started down the track of people
20:38 he was laughing at us without knowing it
20:41 when I'm standing next to him that
20:43 people don't think they sent the rover
20:46 into space the shot of the laboratory
20:51 with the green screens behind the launch
20:54 the Falcon 9 tip where they put the car
20:58 he was told that that was photoshopped
21:01 in but he didn't work for them back in
21:04 those days so he's like chastising these
21:07 people to me all those people that
21:08 thought that you know the green screens
21:11 weren't there mm-hmm
21:14 kid are you just toting some [ __ ] or
21:17 what you know he then mentions the space
21:20 station for a split second which I
21:23 thought was hilarious
21:24 so I'm some sinner kind of listen you
21:26 know it's not gonna be an event where
21:28 I'm gonna be and you know getting into
21:30 some deep conversation but I looked at
21:34 him after he said that and of course
21:35 Mike you know making some friends with
21:37 me that know all about all this stuff
21:39 and they're looking at me like you're
21:41 gonna do this I'm like that so he's
21:43 Mitch's the space station oh no he's
21:45 mentioning the fact that we had
21:47 correctly observed that there were no
21:50 stars and the rover shots as well again
21:53 yes if you adjust an aperture for bright
21:56 light you will probably lose most the
21:58 stars not serious but you'd lose most
22:00 the stars which you wouldn't probably
22:02 use lose the Milky Way but you'd lose
22:04 most that stars he hasn't thought this
22:06 thing through he's defending his
22:08 paradigm of existence and he he just he
22:12 was talking to like somebody else and he
22:14 didn't think that I was going to be
22:15 anything against what he was saying and
22:18 so he goes well you know do you even
22:19 understand how cameras work he's talking
22:22 like third-party to someone else and I
22:26 said well isn't it interesting that the
22:28 space station was built with no window
22:30 pointing towards space he was like oh
22:34 that's true you can crack these people
22:38 in half I mean you just got to be gentle
22:40 with them
22:41 because then they'll they feel like
22:42 you're combating them they they double
22:45 down into [ __ ] and as we get into
22:47 these conversations which match so many
22:49 topics don't they now unless you guys
22:52 can tell me different you know at this
22:55 particular location right here we watch
22:59 YouTube like crazy
23:02 we watched tons of conspiracy stuff
23:05 especially watch other normal ridiculous
23:07 things to lots of japonais to like the
23:10 good stuff but if there was some
23:13 significant new evidence against NASA we
23:17 would be watching it and everyone's
23:20 review of it what's interesting is is
23:23 that NASA has seemingly pulled back on a
23:28 lot of these live broadcasts from the
23:30 space station a lot of this footage they
23:33 keep screwing up with people you know
23:34 flying by on harnesses in the background
23:37 a bunch of obvious you know blue screen
23:41 stuff where people aren't really either
23:43 in the same room together or they're
23:45 grabbing on wires on each other as the
23:47 guy tries to do a Ford flip you know
23:49 faking that he's in zero gravity so
23:52 there has been a change and what was
23:56 interesting is probably I think the last
24:00 time I saw a major surge in videos that
24:03 were tearing this up you know jaren ISM
24:05 and a bunch of other folks it was about
24:08 a year ago and you know Vivian and I
24:13 look at this stuff too and you know
24:15 should look out in her location schmack
24:16 man this really seems real doesn't it
24:18 and I'm like yeah man like some of the
24:20 fly throughs of the tubes are incredible
24:24 it's it's a solid you know it's a shot
24:26 that doesn't turn off and the vomit
24:30 rocket theory is that you get a 60
24:31 second fall from a vomit rocket at
24:33 pretty much the maximum now let's say
24:35 that they could maybe give you another
24:38 30 seconds they go up extra extra high
24:40 in the dump it this some of these shots
24:43 go forever and these the woman with the
24:45 the crazy hairdo right the hairdo that
24:48 would fly off of her head and
24:50 short-circuit a bunch of electronics in
24:52 the right you could not possibly
24:54 well you can't convince me let's just
24:56 put that way that one anyone can wear
24:59 anything they bring up in a duffel bag I
25:01 think that is complete horseshit you
25:02 wouldn't you need a uniform you need a
25:05 uniform that is static proof you know
25:11 like the little wristbands when you
25:13 modify electronics right you need a
25:15 static proof
25:16 static Guard suit on because you could
25:18 easily easily you're in spaceman if
25:22 they're truly 200 miles up roughly right
25:25 you're talking about your 20% towards
25:28 the Van Allen belts which are made of
25:30 pure electrons okay plus you get massive
25:34 radiation up there you do flying from
25:37 Los Angeles to Denver Colorado is a
25:40 chest x-ray okay so this is radiology
25:45 people telling me this stuff okay all
25:48 right what do you think spending a year
25:50 up there or six months up there
25:52 you're completely outside of all the
25:54 protective layers besides the Van Allen
25:56 belts themselves but now you Stran get
25:58 chewed up by the Van Allen belts well if
26:01 you could wear a suit that's got a
26:03 Faraday cage built into the fabric then
26:06 at least you can keep a lot of the you
26:09 know electrons on the outside of your
26:10 body might even be sound to get some
26:16 headgear the whole thing is a Faraday
26:18 thing you doesn't it to be that thick it
26:19 just has to be a Faraday cage and
26:21 remember Faraday Faraday's effect is
26:24 that when you have a wave of electrons
26:30 slash plasma slash electricity slash
26:33 ether coming at a surface texture if you
26:38 have a grid of wire the effect is if the
26:44 frequency of the electricity coming at
26:46 you is unified meaning it's not changing
26:50 its frequency drastically meaning it
26:53 would be like you know your radio going
26:55 from 88 to 106 to 88 to 106 as long as
26:58 that's not occurring as long as it's 106
27:00 which has a vibration it will maintain
27:04 its external path on a fair
27:08 a cage which is like chicken wire you
27:10 know again I saw a dude when I was a kid
27:13 I first moved to Boston I went to the
27:15 Boston Science Museum and there was a
27:17 demonstration of a guy with a I think it
27:20 was a million volts wasn't that it was
27:24 higher but he put his arm on the inside
27:26 of that cage and man that big Tesla coil
27:28 goes way him and just literally hits
27:30 right where his arm is and he didn't die
27:33 I'm pretty sure it was his bare forearms
27:36 too so that's how powerful that is but
27:38 anyway this chick it was a big loan here
27:40 do biologists can do whatever the [ __ ]
27:41 they want up there in this space station
27:43 it's like yours truly is vacuuming them
27:47 up vacuuming up hair it's everywhere in
27:50 my house man and I'm no I don't shed
27:53 that much but come on what you realize
27:56 if you lose one hair and you have short
27:58 hair you don't even see it it's this
28:00 little tiny fiber it's you know size
28:02 your carpet fiber whatever when you lose
28:05 a hair that's two feet long just one
28:07 your little drain at the end of the
28:09 shower could could look like it's got a
28:11 big clump it's like four hairs because
28:13 they're so long for four times two is
28:15 you know eight feet of hair right so you
28:20 can't just have someone running around
28:22 it I don't I don't buy that crap at all
28:26 at all and you can't just bring you know
28:29 a big sweater well have any of you
28:32 messed around in wintertime when you
28:34 walk across the carpet and you touch the
28:36 doorknob and literally you feel pain in
28:38 the fingertips because it just blew up
28:40 about four capillaries as you got
28:42 shocked
28:43 how could you wear clothing that is
28:46 completely staticky you know how many of
28:50 you have a blanket at night this made of
28:53 some similar type of material synthetic
28:56 or organic doesn't matter and you it's
28:59 real dark at night and you move the
29:02 blankets and you see the little tiny
29:03 shocks sparks of light in your blanket
29:07 okay so you're up in space two hundred
29:11 miles let's see how important is it not
29:15 to create anomalies of very avoidable
29:19 stuff by simply wearing a uniform
29:21 what's funny is the shows on Netflix
29:24 that have expansion for instance and all
29:27 those space shows Mia - maybe alien
29:30 money guys most people kind of weren't
29:33 overall an alien the movie everyone's
29:35 were in uniforms it's like Hollywood
29:37 gets it a writer gets it anyone does any
29:39 research goes really oh they're
29:41 obviously wearing uniforms the
29:44 astronauts you know whether they I did
29:48 what you think they did or did what I
29:49 think they did they were those little
29:51 skull caps right so it's just just the
29:53 face was exposed that makes sense even
29:57 those dudes had really short hair
29:58 especially if you had a huge do like
30:01 mine you're not gonna want to fly around
30:03 because the other thing too is hair
30:05 loose in a zero-gravity situation nice
30:07 mentioned this a long time ago made a
30:09 bunch of you laugh imagine you're a guy
30:11 was shorter and you're talking to your
30:15 buddy in zero-gravity and all of a
30:16 sudden you take a deep breath now you're
30:19 sucking that brunettes hair down your
30:21 throat because it's just floating in
30:23 space because she won't put her do up
30:26 cafeterias restaurants you can't cook
30:29 food with long hair you got to put it in
30:32 a bun because it falls into food that
30:34 can create some pretty bad circumstances
30:37 right again me a break so how it could
30:43 be completely fake and some of these
30:44 shots are created I will say I kept
30:48 thinking about how the harnesses could
30:51 work for this woman's incredible tour
30:55 through the Space Station and she's
30:57 changing tubes she's changing complete
30:59 directions and you know again the place
31:02 is a [ __ ] inside that's the other
31:03 thing that you just can't wrap your mind
31:05 around my buddy's in effect special
31:08 effects especially space effects they
31:09 just look at that they just cringe
31:11 you're like how could it be so messy
31:13 constantly this again is a multi
31:17 multi-billion dollar circumstance and
31:20 again during some sort of major event
31:26 you can't have like she went to this one
31:29 escape hatch and it was covered in bags
31:32 crap I mean not physical feces but
31:35 just stuff you know all stacked up
31:38 against the door really so if you need
31:43 to get the hell out of this place in a
31:44 hurry
31:44 help me guys he's got it we got 20
31:47 minutes to get this thing we have four
31:48 seconds we're gonna die poof everybody's
31:50 dead so the thing is not remotely
31:53 architected like a real space station
31:56 would be architected you know again us
32:01 reverse engineering their concepts from
32:05 a layman's standpoint when our most
32:07 basic implementation of these structures
32:10 differs by almost 95% of what you see up
32:15 there you got to start asking some
32:17 questions right but the other big one
32:20 too is you know why did this space well
32:23 we have no footage of the space station
32:24 ever being built that might have you
32:27 know been a real interesting thing you
32:29 know if we built the pyramids today
32:31 don't you think we take a picture you
32:34 know I will say that the sheer lack of
32:39 photographs of satellites besides some
32:43 of the studio work that was the Hubble
32:46 telescope Fiasco it really does start to
32:49 make you think you know this [ __ ] real
32:52 is it real yeah not that it's not
32:54 possible but what I sort of think
32:59 because I've seen military satellite
33:01 designs my own two eyes I started I'm
33:06 starting to think the military ones are
33:07 real and the pedestrian ones that lot
33:10 that steal the money from us to pay for
33:12 those clandestine ones is maybe the scam
33:16 and so you can't take a picture
33:18 something it doesn't exist
33:19 but you're not allowed to take a picture
33:20 of the military ones so what the hell's
33:22 going on you know I don't know but I
33:25 would like to have and it's what's
33:29 what's nuts is what I'm about to ask is
33:31 sort of like a grade school student
33:35 request and yet what I'm asking is
33:39 obviously out of the question because
33:43 it's not happening which is hey NASA
33:46 we need a website that clearly outlines
33:51 the day-to-day objectives of all of your
33:55 departments you can throw it in agile
33:58 you could throw it in a Camden format
34:00 doesn't matter I need to know what's
34:04 that building - what's that building do
34:05 what's that guide you what's that girl
34:07 do what was that launch all about I mean
34:09 I need to know we paid for it we paid
34:12 for it so you could play around have
34:14 some fun where's it going what's it
34:16 doing why are your cameras ever turn off
34:19 if it's not covert you know I've said it
34:23 several times and I want to remind you
34:26 for anyone who especially believes we're
34:28 actually going to Mars I mean the next
34:32 two things I'm going to tell you should
34:34 be painfully obvious in the 21st century
34:40 we should have 4k footage from Earth the
34:49 launch looking down at the pad Cape
34:51 Canaveral Florida launch orbit slingshot
34:57 and then the whole trip to the moon and
35:00 the whole trip to Mars it never shuts
35:03 off it points back at earth to the best
35:06 the best of its ability you can have
35:10 four or five of these cameras look at a
35:11 GoPro right that's a consumer camera
35:14 that can shoot 4k then you might be
35:16 thinking oh but you know they don't have
35:17 enough memory and screw that what it is
35:23 because again they're telling you they
35:25 can get you know 4k if they're not 16k
35:29 composite shots from the surface of Mars
35:31 so our transmission protocol is flawless
35:34 man they've not only got the pixel data
35:37 they've got the color table they have
35:40 everything of compositing capabilities
35:42 so you don't have to actually store all
35:45 the images on the vehicle you simply
35:48 have a buffer that saves it with another
35:51 device transmitting it to earth and as
35:54 we tell the device and a return
35:56 transmission got it got it got it it
35:59 just dumps it out of memory
36:00 and then we go on to the next thing and
36:04 that device could be easily reused once
36:07 it lands to be the storage device for
36:10 other photography from a rover or
36:11 something right now why don't they do
36:14 that why is it that ever occurred one on
36:19 our trips to the moon don't happen very
36:20 often do they you can't go to the moon
36:24 probably for a million reasons but you
36:26 can't go even if you could because none
36:28 of our crops up there from 1969 to 1972
36:32 the Chinese Rovers don't exist up there
36:35 they don't exist
36:37 all that [ __ ] was filmed in their
36:38 backyard the Israeli probe which crashed
36:42 and then they showed photographs and
36:44 then it went offline hilarious right no
36:47 one wants to commit they can't get there
36:49 and now was India is gonna go there
36:51 again or go there at some point it's for
36:54 sale the whole platforms for sale now as
36:57 I did in my NASA for sale episode but
37:01 the reason they can't do this is that
37:03 even though special effects are great
37:07 they still can't simulate believably the
37:12 entire journey from start to finish
37:14 special effects people have all kinds of
37:18 methods to reverse-engineer images and
37:21 look at them and go oh you did this in
37:24 Maya oh you do this at night we've oh
37:26 you're doing this at some proprietary
37:27 thing but I can see the way you've done
37:30 your ray tracing I can see anomalies and
37:33 the way that light's trying to imitate a
37:35 star and when i zoom up on the pixel and
37:38 I see its wiggle that's an algorithmic
37:41 problem that we're trying to solve such
37:42 that that algorithmic you know anomaly
37:45 goes away so they can't do it and they
37:47 won't try oh I'm sure they're trying
37:50 behind the scenes but you know it just
37:55 baffles my mind of well I'll tell you
37:59 this much if paying for this kind of
38:02 stuff where you had literally a hidden
38:05 agenda an agenda that can be forged
38:10 extremely easy
38:12 apparently to the money being spent
38:14 right billions of dollars Hollywood
38:18 could knock it out for way less but now
38:21 think about how well if you don't know I
38:24 don't know how many people have dealt
38:26 with making films or starting businesses
38:29 to borrow money to to go on these
38:33 ventures it's very difficult to find
38:37 that kind of cash but since we were
38:40 actually building a military
38:42 organization to perfect missile
38:44 technology and not go to the moon that's
38:46 what we were doing we wanted
38:48 intercontinental ballistic missiles
38:50 we want them faster better cheaper
38:51 smaller we wanted multiple warheads
38:54 which we got by the late 70s that's what
38:58 we were going for and that's what we got
39:00 for our money so the government was just
39:03 willing to underwrite it in two seconds
39:04 because it was a matter of national
39:06 security
39:06 especially after the Cuban Missile
39:08 Crisis again Russia probably just
39:11 delivered a bunch of like sewer pipes
39:13 painted white and said that there were
39:15 missiles but no one's gonna complain in
39:18 the State Department in America because
39:20 that catalyzed the next form of our
39:23 racketeering now Russia they know
39:27 rockets really really well they're
39:28 extremely good at building the engines
39:30 building the fuselages is great what is
39:35 it
39:35 Britain I don't believe has any Space
39:37 Agency whatsoever they just contribute
39:39 to other people's space agencies France
39:42 has had a few private companies for gosh
39:44 almost 40 years now not more or they've
39:48 kind of created what is now SpaceX and
39:52 what I mean by that is that you know if
39:53 you look at all the French rockets that
39:55 have been going since the late 80s and
39:57 look at SpaceX is entire platform lineup
40:00 it's essentially the same stuff you just
40:03 the same shape of the rocket man so
40:06 obviously there have been advancements
40:08 here and there there's probably been
40:09 four SpaceX I'm assuming and this is
40:13 just a pure assumption no facts
40:14 whatsoever but since they have a fairly
40:19 spotless record after their you know
40:23 initial crashes and stuff initial looks
40:25 oceans maybe they got a little bit of
40:28 covert help from the US government you
40:30 know someone saying oh go there tell
40:32 amount of [ __ ] mega rocket yes sir
40:35 SpaceX as a whole I have nothing against
40:37 whatsoever in fact I think it's a great
40:39 company concept the rover thing give me
40:44 a break
40:44 I mean again if you're late to the game
40:47 on that one man you've got all kinds of
40:50 problems with that concept one the tires
40:52 that are inflated would immediately
40:53 explode and because of NASA's own claims
40:57 about the moon missions just to refresh
41:00 your memory things and shadows were the
41:03 highest I've ever heard of the lowest
41:05 I've ever heard is negative 280 in this
41:07 shadow positive 280 Fahrenheit and the
41:11 light this was a big deal about the
41:13 spacesuits which your total [ __ ] right
41:16 but ok so you got a dashboard in your
41:18 car at your at your house right let's
41:21 say you live in a climate where it gets
41:23 really hot and you've seen the dashboard
41:24 split over the first 10 years you own a
41:26 car why well because it got to maybe 130
41:30 inside the car when you weren't there
41:31 maybe if you're in Vegas well that Rover
41:35 has a dashboard where it has direct
41:39 sunlight and then direct shadow all in
41:42 one piece of plastic well go ask
41:46 somebody in plastics because I've got a
41:48 family member that's an expert of
41:49 plastics manufacturing I've sat down for
41:51 hours having conversations about why he
41:54 makes so much money and why does he make
41:55 so much money because he is a
41:58 mathematician for the way that plastic
42:01 when it cools torques and turns based on
42:04 its width and diameter and the type of
42:06 plastic he's using such that it it the
42:09 mold is actually super distorted and
42:11 then when it dries it falls to the
42:14 perfect position so you cannot have that
42:17 Rover were half the crap in the
42:20 dashboard and what anyone the rotating
42:22 second is 280 degrees right you don't
42:25 light a match with 320 and then all of a
42:28 sudden it's an ice cube it's gonna crack
42:31 it's gonna pop it's gonna explode that
42:33 thing's gonna it would have been a cool
42:34 thing with what if he just said look
42:37 this is cars gonna explode as soon as we
42:39 send into space it's gonna be awesome
42:41 and then they do it for real instead of
42:44 faking it in some you know studio and
42:48 until I see those boosters land retro
42:52 land back down with my own two eyes I
42:54 will never believe those things are real
42:57 first two or three shots look like
42:59 Hollywood Crean shots because the tip of
43:03 the rockets were never in the shot right
43:05 so if you're looking on YouTube it's
43:07 like you know my hands out a shot well
43:09 that's where the cranes attached and in
43:11 the kick stains down below when they
43:13 landed bounced really heavily and they
43:17 bounced in a just in a non logical
43:20 manner as to a landing you know at least
43:23 for my my eyes I have only seen one
43:27 video clip supposedly of a SpaceX
43:30 employee filming this from a fairly far
43:33 away distance but that makes special
43:36 effects even easier alright if you need
43:39 to CG a human being walking in the
43:41 desert but you're gonna keep them you
43:43 know about 1/100 of the size of the
43:46 screen well I need you're really only
43:48 moving a few pixels it's no big deal
43:50 but if you got a film it really close
43:52 see the you know bloodshot eyes then you
43:56 better have the best CG team in the
43:57 world to pull that off right so NASA
44:01 still remains permanently suspect in my
44:05 eyes and what I need to research I guess
44:10 you could say is this sort of
44:12 relationship because the Jack Parsons
44:14 lavage I mean JPL laboratories the look
44:16 of Jack Parsons the reason why I always
44:18 make that joke this Jack Parsons was
44:20 into some really weird [ __ ] he was a
44:22 really strange guy and he founded what
44:25 has now been renamed as Jet Propulsion
44:27 Laboratory so you have
44:29 I don't know I think he's hanging out
44:32 with Aleister Crowley and and what is it
44:35 the Scientology dude l ron Hubbard with
44:39 Oppenheimer I mean these guys were all
44:41 in this weird little clique together
44:43 in Pasadena it's just strange you know
44:47 maybe there's nothing to it
44:48 but that existed prior my memory to
44:51 NASA's formal you know creation okay now
44:58 here's the other thing because we are
45:00 getting a few web pages on this but
45:04 again what I always like to do to
45:06 validate something I'm seeing that's
45:08 being claimed with well that's making
45:10 outrageous claims which NASA is nothing
45:12 but pure unadulterated outrageous claims
45:16 and we have picked apart their stuff I
45:19 mean we have astronauts ain't ain't in
45:21 OTS on the space station that are in
45:25 blue-screen we know it for an absolute
45:28 fact we've got a guy several people
45:30 flipping in this this front rotation to
45:32 prove they're in zero gravity
45:33 the guy grabbing a wire and his clothing
45:36 does well he's pull things it's a
45:37 standard Hollywood prop man we've got
45:40 another scene where two guys were
45:41 sitting there talking in a tea tube in
45:43 the background a guy goes by on a
45:44 harness on a black harness we have a
45:50 woman that was rotating a stuffed animal
45:52 she keeps rotating and rotating it and
45:54 then all of a sudden it hits the tension
45:56 of the wire and first to flip backwards
45:58 and she grabs it then looks off screen
46:00 it makes her face like oh oh she wasn't
46:02 talking the guy next to her was talking
46:04 so she kind of figured nobody noticed
46:05 but everybody noticed we got a guy
46:07 pulling himself down a pipe and then
46:10 because he's in zero-g he grabs the door
46:14 jamb of another adjacent pipe goes
46:16 through the pipe and the guy turns
46:18 transparent as he goes through the pipe
46:20 because it's a CG composite right think
46:25 about it
46:26 we as citizens let's just say one of two
46:31 scenarios has occurred NASA's outed as
46:33 being a completely fake organization and
46:35 a ton of people go to jail all their
46:39 pensions are canceled
46:42 ansel we're not gonna put you in jail
46:44 you were just stupid working for this
46:47 place as on an intellectual discerning
46:48 with discernment level but you don't get
46:50 pension for a fake job so see you later
46:52 enjoy life you're smart go become a
46:55 professor somewhere we know take care of
46:57 yourself okay but here's a Scarlet
46:59 Letter we're going to tattoo on your
47:01 forehead hoaxster right see that happens
47:06 or we read we go back to who has a
47:09 project Looking Glass and we undo the
47:11 formation of NASA no claim of going to
47:13 the moon no claim of a space station and
47:15 it's gonna happen on our watch
47:17 and we've also reset times such that all
47:21 the bad people went away or never
47:23 existed okay so now we clean the slate
47:26 now we have to create NASA we're not
47:30 gonna call it that we'll call it space
47:32 force no but now we are going to go to
47:37 the moon if we can we got to start doing
47:40 all the experiments that they were doing
47:42 we have to create different agencies to
47:46 handle different areas right we want the
47:48 rocketeers to be ingenious with
47:51 racketeering just figure out how to do
47:52 basic racketeering racketeering and then
47:55 we'll tell you what sort of payload
47:56 we're gonna have to push up at a later
47:58 time once we figure out how much all the
48:00 payload stuff is gonna actually weigh
48:02 what we're gonna need okay so we start
48:07 building facilities to figure out
48:10 environmental control systems again for
48:13 instance the spacesuits that went to the
48:15 moon or a complete hogwash because of
48:18 the temperature issue you can't have a
48:20 backpack that will supply you with the
48:24 amount of oxygen that those astronauts
48:26 had again a diver tube the biggest diver
48:30 tube you can you can buy as a scuba
48:32 diver or deep-sea diver will last an
48:35 amateur one hour and a professional two
48:38 hours because of the discipline
48:41 breathing changes the duration and you
48:43 can put two on your back so you can get
48:44 two hours or four hours depending on how
48:46 you're you're up there well they're up
48:48 on the moon for a day at one point okay
48:51 I mean on the moon which means the
48:54 capsules got to have a bunch of oxygen
48:55 and all this
48:56 have to have a bunch of oxygen well they
48:58 never resolved that issue the other
49:00 issue is the temperature thing when they
49:02 put those crappy spacesuits in the the
49:05 desert of California here there's 160
49:09 degrees inside the suit the NASA
49:12 astronauts passed out and that was the
49:14 last test ever conducted in a real
49:16 environment
49:17 okay so we proved they didn't work and
49:19 then we just never visited it again it
49:21 sounds like the the clinical testing for
49:23 aspartame so we would have to actually
49:27 do it actually to figure this whole
49:30 thing out how do we deliver just the
49:34 sheer supplies to be in space that long
49:37 you know it's a few days there and then
49:40 you have to do some sort of orbital you
49:42 know rendezvous with this moon object
49:46 you're gonna have to figure out how to
49:47 slow your descent down again one of the
49:51 first video games ever created in 1969
49:54 or 68 was this lunar lander game and it
49:57 was actually text when it first came out
49:59 and you simply typed in the amount of
50:01 fuel you wanted to spend per second and
50:03 it would kept you know reducing the
50:05 landing speed what they didn't really
50:08 tell you until they made the actual
50:09 video game with them with a picture of
50:12 the lunar lander is that you actually
50:13 need to turn the lander in the direction
50:15 you're traveling as you're going in
50:17 orbit still cuz they're haulin ass right
50:20 you're hauling ass you're going you know
50:23 maybe seventeen to thirty thousand miles
50:27 an hour depending on what kind of engine
50:28 and configuration you're using let's
50:30 just go to fifteen thousand miles an
50:31 hour fifteen thousand miles an hour
50:34 people think about it the bullet comes
50:37 out of a gun around what twelve hundred
50:39 okay so you gonna slow that vehicle down
50:43 and being in a slingshot orbit around
50:46 the moon doesn't slow you down
50:47 necessarily effect it might even speed
50:49 you up I don't know but you're gonna
50:50 have to slow down that horizontal
50:53 movement otherwise when you hit the
50:54 surface of the moon you're gonna be paté
50:57 we're gonna need a lot of fuel to do
50:59 that and what's your engine gonna be
51:01 pushing off of that's the other thing
51:03 we're not sure that these Conal engines
51:06 actually work in space because what are
51:08 you pushing off of
51:10 you pushing off yourself it's like
51:11 pulling yourself up by your bootstraps
51:13 right it's a joke you can't do it you
51:15 can't lift yourself off the ground by
51:17 yanking on your shoelaces same sort of
51:19 theory in space if you're nothing to
51:21 push off of what a go anywhere case in
51:24 point we put rocket engines pointed at
51:28 the ground those are hitting those
51:31 engines are hitting the ground and then
51:33 gives it lift and then it's also hitting
51:35 atmosphere really thick atmosphere all
51:38 right so we're gonna have to solve every
51:44 single one of these issues it's gonna
51:46 take a long long time and just because
51:49 JFK said let's do it 10 years that means
51:52 nothing nothing it's gonna take however
51:56 long it takes to get it done which is
51:59 why we know we didn't go to the moon and
52:01 yeah you know Buzz Aldrin probably
52:03 punched you in the face if you told him
52:04 again that we went there dingo scuse me
52:08 imagine being like a buzz and I've been
52:13 kind of harping on this a little bit
52:14 lately in a lot of my episodes but I
52:17 want to really slow it down for one
52:18 second here to really get to the
52:20 psychosis that makes him punch bart
52:23 sibrel in the face this dude is you know
52:26 going to the moon in his story in 1969
52:30 July well they've just killed a bunch of
52:34 people that that decade right JFK
52:37 Malcolm X Martin Luther King and JFK's
52:41 brother
52:42 Robert Kennedy just boom and a whole
52:44 bunch of other people that got shot in
52:46 the gut and you know it was the name of
52:48 the game you [ __ ] with us we're gonna
52:50 kill you so when they pull these three
52:53 astronauts aside and tell them look I
52:55 don't think we need to tell you 33
52:59 degree Masons what we're willing to do
53:02 we do to you
53:02 if you [ __ ] around with the truth here
53:04 you're gone now the stupid thing is had
53:07 they just done a press conference
53:09 together and said we were forced to say
53:11 we went we didn't go
53:13 no one could kill him it really because
53:16 they'd say and they're gonna kill us you
53:17 know that's what they say so we've got
53:19 we need your help keep us safe CIA's
53:22 gonna kill us
53:23 whoever whoever stood it it probably
53:26 have been okay but I think they got
53:28 addicted to one little one little caveat
53:31 not just the fame people will be like
53:33 all they're famous hmm I'm sure that
53:36 doesn't hurt but taking Fame for a
53:38 fraudulent act is probably has the
53:41 opposite feeling on anyone that's got
53:43 any decent morals and just because they
53:45 help commit this crime doesn't mean they
53:47 were all bastards before they decided to
53:49 do that nor bastards after they conceded
53:52 what I'm about to say so they definitely
53:55 know beyond the shadow of a doubt they
53:59 could be murdered and you better believe
54:02 the surveillance on them must have been
54:03 insane for the first several years right
54:07 but they see the ticker tape parades and
54:09 they see the inspiration which is why
54:11 buzz when he told that little girl and
54:14 they trying to say that you know I read
54:15 and Snopes [ __ ] on Internet snow
54:17 it's like the biggest lying organization
54:21 on planet earth funded by George Soros
54:23 guy who's pretty unsavory items in his
54:27 own right but you know this little girl
54:30 eight-year-old girl asks him why didn't
54:32 why we ever gone back at 50 years and
54:34 which will happen in two years would be
54:37 the 50-year anniversary of not going
54:39 back and then he says we didn't and then
54:45 he proceeds to tell him but you needed
54:46 to know that everywhere I went in the
54:48 world where they congratulated us for
54:51 going to the moon even in countries that
54:53 didn't participate they were still
54:55 saying we went to the moon and that was
54:57 mankind celebrating this event and so it
55:00 was like invention of the new Jesus if
55:03 it's improving everyone's life and
55:06 inspiring people do you really want to
55:08 turn it off you know in my opinion it
55:12 depends on what your charter is if your
55:14 charter is you know truth regardless of
55:18 how much it hurts well then you need to
55:20 just you don't have to be angry or sad
55:22 or anything but you need to have the
55:27 courage to dump it all out get rid of
55:29 everything so he's got a threat and he
55:32 has this perceivable reward that society
55:36 got from his
55:37 and act I just mentioned buzz because
55:41 Michael has barely ever been on camera
55:43 since he did it and Neal's gone Neil
55:46 tried to tell us in his last speech
55:47 about hidden truths he definitely wanted
55:50 to say something but whatever I think
55:54 when you get old you get passively cam
55:56 whatever like all that I'm just gonna
55:58 die and hope God understands the buzz
56:02 for me was the most revealing in his
56:06 outburst for Bart's of Braille
56:11 interviewing him and showing him proof
56:13 we didn't go which if you haven't seen
56:15 it go see a funny thing happened on the
56:18 way to the moon I believe you can see it
56:19 on YouTube please go to
56:20 subbable.com/scishow and get the video
56:25 just to support the dude but and I have
56:29 an interview in season 3 should you
56:31 should watch with Bart you said it was
56:34 one of his best interviews ever by the
56:36 way but now you built up the psychosis
56:40 you've got these two challenging
56:43 concepts in your brain they're gonna
56:45 kill me and look how many people I
56:47 inspired which the people who were gonna
56:49 kill me they're will kill me I've
56:51 reminded me look how wonderful this
56:54 effect has been on society you've
56:56 inspired kids to get into science like
56:58 me buy this lie and so this is how the
57:01 earth works you know Jesus probably
57:05 never ever existed but I would even tell
57:08 you to study the word of Christ study
57:11 the Bible study because it's a you know
57:12 at times man it's like the most inspired
57:15 algorithms of how to treat each other so
57:18 I don't really want us to lose the
57:22 message just because there's a little
57:23 factual history swap here and there
57:26 right by the way had some do tell me the
57:29 existence of Christ is the most
57:31 historically documented thing ever and
57:33 say documented without a single single
57:37 moment of proof so those two things
57:40 don't work together just you know but so
57:43 buzz is in his brain and someone is
57:44 coming up to him going I'm gonna I'm
57:46 gonna force you to reveal this hoax
57:51 buzzes like 90 now so he would have been
57:53 70 or so when Martin got him in that
57:56 interview and now he's like sort of like
58:02 hey I've done more thinking about this
58:05 than you mr. Saburo I have had to live
58:11 in this sort of paradox of evil and good
58:14 existing in the same consciousness which
58:17 is his consciousness right and he says I
58:21 think his opinion probably in his brain
58:23 is that a point where he's like you
58:25 don't get the right to make me deal with
58:27 this because I'm dealing with this every
58:30 single day Bart is a guy that's like
58:33 truth regardless if you like it or not
58:36 and that's sort of my attitude as well
58:38 now me imposing that on another human
58:41 being and I think it would be I might
58:44 treat the I don't know the president of
58:48 NASA is long gone now like that you know
58:51 like you know better you're the one or
58:53 maybe someone in the intelligence
58:55 agencies that are trying to you know
58:57 threaten these people you know that's
58:59 where you might take an attitude if you
59:01 had the balls to do it right there's
59:04 that old saying you know pick your
59:05 battles right the biggest wisdom about
59:08 pick your own battles and I'm gonna make
59:10 an episode on it who knows is the
59:13 cost-benefit analysis of every battle
59:16 that you could fight on a particular day
59:17 on a particular moment of your life you
59:20 know I do tons of episodes and I hear
59:23 myself say the wrong word and like I get
59:26 season and episode intertwine I've done
59:29 it recently a lot it makes me cringe but
59:33 I'll say the one person's name but I'll
59:35 say the wrong year by you know like I'll
59:38 say 2014 when I meant to say in 1984 I
59:41 don't know why you know I got other
59:42 things in my brain I'm preparing to say
59:44 to you guys and I start allowing the
59:46 words to swap but I hear friends do the
59:49 same thing especially when people
59:52 downstairs explain conspiracies to
59:54 someone who's a newcomer and it's
59:56 starting to flood things and so I kind
59:58 of wait and wait and wait I'm like I
59:59 think that person heard what the first
60:03 person explaining it was what
60:05 to say you know if you say like I mean
60:08 it's sort of like Pelosi you keep
60:09 calling Trump Bush but that was funny
60:11 she's utterly losing her mind
60:13 unfortunately for her but so there's a
60:16 moment so you can be this nitpicker
60:18 that kind of thing and then there's the
60:20 big ones is this affecting society
60:22 agenda 21
60:23 it's totally above-ground in Europe they
60:28 talk about all the time that meetings
60:29 about it but over here it's a conspiracy
60:31 theory so I think that the average
60:36 citizen who doesn't allow themselves or
60:38 isn't forced to by design of their
60:41 career to get involved in a situation
60:43 these astronauts found themselves in we
60:47 kind of have to take a step back and say
60:49 you know what if you really concentrate
60:52 on their issues and and like we just did
60:57 we might have a definite clue of what
61:01 it's like to be Buzz Aldrin Michael
61:03 Collins and Neil Armstrong all the other
61:05 folks but if you're just an average
61:07 citizen joining the conversation and
61:09 like yeah [ __ ] those guys I would say
61:12 that those individuals haven't spent any
61:14 time thinking about what it's like to be
61:16 in this horrible situation so we might
61:18 be able to say they don't have a clue
61:20 and so until we have a clue we got a
61:25 temper our responses to this whole thing
61:30 we gotta be little careful about being
61:33 you know high and mighty or getting on
61:35 the soap boxes they might say we might
61:38 have done the same exact thing
61:40 especially if we came from that era you
61:43 know born long before and then I mean
61:48 those guys were in there what their late
61:50 20s early 30s most of them and you know
61:54 yeah that's older you know I'm talking
61:57 to like a 15 year old kid they might
61:59 think oh but that's an old guy he should
62:01 totally know and it's like naked that's
62:03 not actually that old you know it's
62:05 probably more mature than today for sure
62:09 but you know the other thing too is to
62:12 say look if you've never ever dealt with
62:15 that situation in your life
62:18 okay we got a pullback now you know what
62:20 if one of you was the president United
62:22 States instantaneously the president of
62:24 your particular country overnight and
62:26 you've got all these ideas of how to fix
62:28 your country and then maybe the world or
62:30 something but if you never had that
62:32 responsibility before well you don't
62:35 know what the job really means you know
62:38 imagine you're sitting in some throne or
62:40 some chair or some round table and then
62:42 you go okay bring me all the problems
62:44 that are happening right now and I'll
62:46 just knock them all out of the park and
62:48 one by one you realize they're all
62:49 interconnected and it's like a domino
62:52 effect well if I help this person that
62:54 screws that person I help this person
62:55 screws this other party am I gonna do I
62:59 need to I need to just do this really
63:02 simple thing but we don't have money to
63:03 pay people to do it or not we have
63:05 enough money to have enough resources
63:09 it's a rough job let's get back to our
63:13 original thread here which is the idea
63:18 that we building this organization from
63:21 scratch you know I don't know if someone
63:24 said to you like this always happens in
63:26 business you might have this big idea
63:29 this is a funny thing that happens with
63:31 kind of newcomers to businesses you have
63:34 like a rookie with a really great idea
63:36 and then a business person who's done it
63:38 before done something you know building
63:41 something from scratch and they say you
63:45 know they get together at some party
63:47 meeting something riding an elevator
63:50 playing a game of golf whatever it is
63:51 and you know the older guy is like oh
63:54 what's going on man I got this great
63:57 idea yeah I heard about this so tell me
63:59 tell me what it is kid does a great job
64:01 explaining the business idea then the
64:05 professional says well how much would
64:07 something like that cost
64:08 and how long would it take to make it
64:10 how many people do you think we're
64:12 talking about hiring here then the kids
64:15 like oh I don't know probably million
64:19 dollars you know why no if I had a
64:21 billion I could do it that's where it
64:26 starts to make a man out of you
64:28 right so someone were to ask us
64:31 really early in the game okay we've
64:35 appropriated NASA they're gone
64:37 we've appropriated GPL we've poached
64:40 resources for space force so that's
64:43 going to be fairly above ground and
64:44 legit and where its covert you
64:46 understand why it's covert I still think
64:50 my episode about replacing NASA which
64:53 aired 45 days at least before Trump and
64:56 now space force was to my obviously
65:01 space force with something being planned
65:03 but I must have drawn from that DNA
65:05 because that's exactly what Trump did
65:07 but if you want to hear a really good
65:09 breakdown of replacing NASA and forming
65:11 this exact organization on a military
65:13 level because what I'm talking about the
65:14 citizen level go watch that episode
65:17 because I still lean on that fairly
65:20 heavily in my own mind is the way to do
65:22 it but we as a society would have to say
65:25 okay we don't know how long is it gonna
65:28 take however if we could have our
65:33 scientists say okay we're gonna build a
65:38 stair-stepped stack of technology which
65:41 in the end will become our platform and
65:44 if you've ever dealt with programming
65:45 and those of you haven't I'll tell you
65:47 they always draw a diagram of sort of
65:50 the stages of technology that rely on
65:55 each other for instance the CPU and your
65:57 computer talks binary above that's
65:59 machine language above that is your non
66:03 interpreted code the stuff that you
66:05 write but you could have in that realm
66:07 you could be programming in Microsoft C
66:10 but then someone gave you a library that
66:12 handles data communications with the
66:14 modem you know with this and that so you
66:16 stack all these things up and eventually
66:18 you have this huge architecture that
66:20 will give you what you need we have the
66:23 same thing we have the rocket inside the
66:27 rocket we have the environmental systems
66:30 we have all the science and data
66:33 technology we've got technology that
66:34 allows an astronaut to go outside
66:36 they've got the lunar lander that's
66:38 probably going to have to get down on
66:41 the surface of the moon if that isn't
66:45 capable of getting all the way back to
66:47 either the space station around Earth
66:49 which is probably how we would do it or
66:51 all the way back to earth and we have to
66:52 have a separate capsule like they used
66:54 the service module that then it
66:57 rendezvous with if we would recreated
66:59 the old format we wouldn't want to do
67:00 that unless it was the right thing but
67:03 if we can sell and find out all put this
67:06 way we do a huge analysis on this whole
67:08 thing maybe give ourselves five years
67:10 just to do the analysis and we say okay
67:13 if we can get rocket technology
67:16 perfected with a certain payload but we
67:19 don't know what's gonna go in there we
67:21 can at least start shoving things into
67:23 space if we need to get better satellite
67:26 technology better pictures of Earth
67:28 whatever it is so we start upselling
67:30 each stage of the system well the
67:32 environmental system which could take a
67:36 person to the moon and keep them all
67:37 okay might be really handy and
67:40 Antarctica or in some huge desert
67:42 community maybe some spin-off technology
67:44 start solving world hunger
67:46 start creating water out of nothing
67:48 start taking deserts and turning them
67:50 into lush you know farms on and on and
67:55 on so as we build each piece or
67:58 immediately up selling it to the public
67:59 and making it available to the public
68:02 now as I said in my replacing NASA
68:05 episode in regards to military
68:09 technology you know it's really funny so
68:12 Sid Sydney passed and people went out
68:16 and looked at a bunch of his lectures
68:17 and one of his lectures and he was very
68:20 forthcoming about this he said you know
68:25 he's talked about anti-gravity and he
68:26 looks at the audience and he goes we
68:27 have anti-gravity you've had it for a
68:29 very long time
68:30 but that's a different conversation he
68:32 goes back into his presentation so one
68:33 of the fans went to the Sydney page and
68:36 said does posted that you know YouTube
68:40 video and then asked a question whether
68:42 he said justice it really know about
68:43 antigravity like let me know well this
68:48 conversation was said several times and
68:50 he had military people visit him and
68:55 in order to impress it they revealed
68:57 covert technology to him all the time
68:59 now they don't tell him how it works
69:01 necessarily I mean they'll give him some
69:03 thumbnails and stuff but you know you
69:06 could put all the thumbnails that was
69:07 ever told and you still have nothing
69:09 okay you've got basically a Marvel movie
69:11 but for instance the was the first Iron
69:15 Man had the I was at the mercury in the
69:20 tube going in a circle which has you
69:23 know been done way before the Iron Man
69:25 movie but the guy actually told CID once
69:29 considers talking about having a you
69:31 know if you Electrify spinning mercury
69:34 that it creates an electromagnetic field
69:36 around the object that makes it zero
69:38 gravity and the guy who last came to sit
69:40 which I don't even know when this was he
69:42 just tells me that people come to him he
69:46 said oh yeah he said that's that was
69:47 ditched a long time ago in the 90s
69:49 ceases we've got totally totally easier
69:52 anti-gravity right now it's it's all
69:54 done and so Syd was actually telling the
69:57 truth that in terms of what he's been
69:59 told by authorities
70:00 this kind of stuff exists well what I
70:02 said in my replacing NASA episode on a
70:05 military level is we have what's called
70:08 black box technology which is they might
70:11 create a black box technology piece and
70:15 there's all kinds of cool methodologies
70:18 of engineering black boxes where if you
70:23 were to try to take it apart it
70:25 self-destructs everything you thought
70:28 you needed to know will just be gone by
70:30 the time you open it up and the funny
70:32 thing was when I was a kid when they
70:35 first came out with cable scrambling
70:36 boxes where they had the cable to your
70:38 house but they transmitted up a show
70:40 with the Scramble you have this all the
70:42 time with fight stuff right at your
70:43 house the box on your TV is D scrambling
70:47 under your TV whatever that funny
70:49 everything was on your TV and now it's
70:51 under your TV but it obviously knows the
70:54 algorithm and it's deciphering it well
70:58 they would pass around schematics in the
71:00 early 80s that you could buy all the
71:02 parts and solder it all together and you
71:05 could make your own descrambler box
71:07 well one of them was this and I don't
71:16 know why they did this but I saw it with
71:18 my own two eyes there was a service in
71:22 Massachusetts that was like HBO it was
71:24 called preview it just came and went but
71:27 the preview box that you got at your
71:30 house had a hammer in it that if you
71:33 were to take the screws off and open up
71:35 the box this hammer would slam the PC
71:40 board which is a little goofy because
71:43 you're not really destroying the
71:45 evidence of what's there I mean you
71:47 could voltage meter every single
71:48 resistor and capacitor and diode and all
71:53 that stuff and figure out exactly what
71:55 was there you can look at every single
71:56 one of the chips and eventually deduce
71:58 where it's from no you didn't have the
71:59 internet to do all the work for you but
72:01 someone in the know would know and so my
72:05 dad tried to reverse engineer this box
72:07 once eventually the parts got to be
72:09 insanely costly to do it by hand but
72:12 anyway today it's not an issue and so
72:17 the military could maybe under major
72:22 observation for launches and things they
72:24 could make a black box that's
72:27 anti-gravity up to a certain magnitude
72:29 you need a certain power supply which is
72:31 another black box of zero-point energy
72:32 it feeds into the antimatter engine of a
72:36 certain capability and boom you don't
72:40 have Rockets anymore you got ships that
72:42 simply take off like everything you've
72:44 ever seen in a sci-fi movie like the
72:45 Millennium Falcon well if we're gonna
72:49 build a private organization we could
72:52 build various black box technology maybe
72:54 not quite up to you know zero-point
72:57 energy systems or anti-gravity systems
72:59 but maybe the thing you don't want to do
73:03 is obviously let it get into terrorists
73:05 hands and then there they're carrying
73:07 continent over New York and dropping it
73:09 right so I think there's ways of doing
73:13 it just with the layman's approach just
73:16 saying look you don't have to be a
73:18 scientist to logistically plan out what
73:20 you would
73:21 need to get there you just may not have
73:23 the the total of what something might
73:27 weigh its capacity it's its volumetric
73:31 space right so you might have something
73:33 that's like hey the way we have to build
73:35 this thing it only weighs 10,000 pounds
73:36 but it's the size of a house and there's
73:38 just no other way we can cram the
73:40 circuitry any tighter than that you get
73:43 into those kind of arguments as well I
73:45 think those exercises are really fun for
73:49 the brain because you'll find out how
73:53 smart you really are without having all
73:55 these massive degrees and according to
73:58 NASA and I have to say with computer
74:00 technology today if you can give a
74:03 computer accurate gravid gravity
74:07 information right and I know a lot
74:09 people sell gravity doesn't exist it
74:11 doesn't exist the way that they tell you
74:13 as a pole but it exists as a push and
74:17 for the major listeners they're rolling
74:19 their eyes because they've heard that a
74:19 thousand times but if you just say look
74:22 earth generally pulls this much on mass
74:24 we think the moon is that much pole Sun
74:29 whatever what all the variables are then
74:31 a computer could I think very easily
74:34 find all the algorithms especially a
74:37 quantum computer when those things start
74:39 functioning oh my god it's almost like
74:41 the deep thoughts is like a two-second
74:43 little thing being oh here's the answer
74:45 to you know life the universe and
74:46 everything so I think that we have a lot
74:49 of assistance now that they didn't have
74:51 in the 60s and so if we can start
74:53 building these components for real and
74:56 the other thing is is that we don't know
74:58 how much stuff we've actually already
75:00 invented you know there may be a lot of
75:03 scientists out there that are looking at
75:05 solutions going geez isn't this great
75:07 would it be nice if we could use this
75:09 technology and someone new kid in the
75:11 room is like whoa I can't wait like well
75:13 because the world doesn't know this
75:14 exists and if we debut this technology
75:17 as a solution just like the Orion
75:19 project then there note they will know
75:22 that we never had it in the first place
75:23 and therefore we didn't do the things
75:27 that we said we did in the past the only
75:29 thing we could do is release this new
75:31 technology as an improvement over the
75:33 previous technology
75:35 and but then we can't explain how it
75:37 works because the second we explain how
75:39 our thing works they'll find out that's
75:41 the only way this could possibly have
75:43 ever worked and then we're back to where
75:45 we started or a bunch of liars and it's
75:47 really unfortunate for brilliant people
75:49 that are working for these organizations
75:51 because they've been sold a bill of
75:53 goods they have to believe it because it
75:55 gives them all the tchotchkes in life
75:57 right I work for knows I work for SpaceX
75:59 I'm this on that not realizing they're
76:03 really forging themselves as aiding and
76:07 abetting of it's really really sad now
76:11 there's definitely active personnel both
76:13 organizations that know they're engaging
76:14 in fraud totally but just like all
76:18 infections and agencies where they
76:20 become very black and very dark it's
76:24 usually usually a tiny sliver at the top
76:26 tiny sliver of covert employees that
76:29 fake it out for all the other employees
76:31 and then they can stay ignorant and
76:33 blissful and think that they're finding
76:35 the Higgs boson particle when they're
76:38 actually doing nothing but looking at a
76:39 computer screen giving them feedback
76:42 data is someone just programmed the
76:43 night before you know and that's that's
76:46 actually a point I want you guys to go
76:49 away with from this conversation which
76:51 is any scientific why should say any
76:57 outrageous scientific discovery meaning
77:00 they're claiming something outrageous
77:02 but they can't prove it to you
77:04 they just just trust me right where they
77:07 deduced that they had the indication of
77:10 the scientific result by looking at a
77:13 computer monitor giving them numbers
77:16 giving them a graph that is the great a
77:21 species of a scam that's being played on
77:23 those that are looking at the monitor
77:25 and so again the results from any Hadron
77:29 Collider that result could be completely
77:32 fake could be real could be fake could
77:36 be one of the experiments can be real
77:37 and the other experiment needs to be
77:38 fake it's so easy easy technically
77:45 to create these frauds and the people
77:48 that work for these organizations in
77:49 such a powerful way that they would pass
77:52 a lie-detector test you know when I
77:56 first had that epiphany many many years
77:58 ago making this show but yeah you could
78:01 take everyone from like command central
78:04 or ground control as David Bowie would
78:06 call it and say did we go to the moon
78:09 here's a lie-detector test it's all
78:11 gonna be green for all these employees
78:13 but now if we started to say do you have
78:16 personal proof that man stepped on the
78:19 moon I mean you were there you saw it
78:21 happen well then they'd have to answer
78:22 no and they'd still be green but then we
78:25 start to get to the crux to the problem
78:27 which is proof is largely mythical you
78:31 know and it just to kind of dial back to
78:33 previous conversations as we're wrapping
78:36 up this one it's often asked to me does
78:40 it matter
78:41 does this really matter the moon thing
78:44 hey it's a long time ago blah blah I
78:48 think it does because people need to
78:50 know it's we've never done it so any kid
78:52 that would be inspired to do it for the
78:54 very first time we get that amazing
78:56 child to grow up to want to do it more
78:59 importantly than that we have to make
79:01 sure that we don't allow the archetype
79:02 of lying to steal money be okay I do
79:08 swisher Sweets era as well they're so
79:10 delicious what's interesting about this
79:13 conversation about NASA in general is
79:15 that you know I'm 50 at 2020 okay I
79:22 don't know if I don't know if we're ever
79:26 gonna see well I don't know if I'm ever
79:30 gonna see us actually go to the moon I
79:32 don't know well I see a hoax of us going
79:35 to the moon
79:36 yeah probably well I see a hoax of us
79:40 going to Mars yeah probably
79:43 what I rather see NASA get shut down and
79:46 reorganized yeah I would again a lot of
79:51 brilliant people there they're ready to
79:52 do the right thing probably ninety eight
79:55 point nine percent of the people just
79:57 right
79:58 you go oh that's horrible I would have
80:01 never joined this organization had I
80:02 known but I'm a smart person and let's
80:06 get to it and then if we start to do it
80:09 for real that I definitely most likely
80:11 will never see it occur because it's
80:13 gonna take a really long time to pull it
80:14 off unless again some covert stuff
80:17 happens
80:18 now somebody afforded me an article
80:21 which was I want to think I can't
80:23 remember exactly who did it but it was
80:27 an article written quite a long time ago
80:29 saying that we'll never go to the moon
80:30 because the moon is pure plasma which I
80:35 find that the entire statement so
80:39 intriguing now what I think that really
80:43 meant I read through the article I did I
80:46 didn't hear anything about how he was
80:49 explaining that it was plasma now I
80:51 think at the interior of all celestial
80:53 bodies is a ball of plasma and I think
80:55 most well I think every single thing
80:58 other than a meteor which is very small
81:01 has a hollow sphere made of plasma and
81:06 that's how the whole universe is
81:07 connected together so because we can see
81:11 the moon has a shadow on it it can't be
81:15 made of plasma on the outside because it
81:17 would be the most blinding light you've
81:20 ever seen it would look similar to the
81:23 Sun so the only thing I could think of
81:27 that this gentleman was trying to allude
81:29 to is that it's merely a plasma ball
81:31 covered with a light
81:33 well thick enough that the plasma
81:35 doesn't beam through but light enough
81:38 that if we landed on it we might just
81:40 squish into it like you know like
81:42 quicksand now how he would have ever
81:44 deuced this accurately that's even a
81:48 more outrageous claim but the one thing
81:52 that I mentioned on this show and I
81:55 still I'm yet to see one other youtube
81:58 channel ever assert this and if you've
82:00 seen it someplace else I'd love to check
82:01 the date on it versus my assertion do
82:04 craters exist where I suggest that
82:07 everything on earth you've ever seen
82:09 that's been claimed to be a crater is
82:10 actually a volcanic
82:11 loschen it was super funny about it is
82:15 you see people that have been raised
82:19 with this theory
82:20 I was raised with that theory that it
82:21 was a meteorite again those of you
82:26 haven't been into America in Arizona we
82:29 have this massive what looks like a
82:31 crater it's like three miles around well
82:35 mile across half mile down and but when
82:39 I went to so I've been there like six
82:43 times I used to travel between here and
82:45 Kansas I always stopped by personally my
82:47 family took me there a couple times but
82:50 the second you go to Diamond Head in
82:52 Hawaii I know on Oahu Island
82:55 it looks exactly the same it just has
82:57 foliage around it looks exactly the same
83:00 I've showed you this but the
83:02 side-by-side comparison is a million
83:03 times and when I started looking at the
83:05 craters on the moon they're all
83:06 perfectly circular there's no [ __ ]
83:09 way in hell those things are all
83:10 circular if it's random rocks from space
83:12 banging into the moon maybe a lot of
83:16 them might you know go and then lose a
83:19 base does he make any sense orbital
83:21 things losing their orbit and falling
83:22 into the moon's gravitational force
83:25 would still create a Superman scoop out
83:27 of the ground right on the subject of
83:30 the moon has a plasma terior I think I
83:32 personally have cracked it which are
83:34 those pictures that we get from
83:36 telescopes from normal citizens who have
83:40 filmed craters that are bubbling in the
83:42 direct center of the crater a pure white
83:46 plasma looking stuff and it's splashing
83:49 into the bubble crater that's created by
83:53 a volcanic eruption from the bottom it
83:57 looks like the moon was boiling not too
83:59 long ago which is why I absolutely love
84:03 the theory that the moon is an old Sun
84:05 but once it burned out someone just
84:07 threw the light bulb in which is why
84:09 Plato knows about a time before the moon
84:11 one of the other listeners just reminded
84:14 me that even though in one day time
84:19 period you can see the moon on one side
84:22 of the sky and you can see the Sun on
84:24 the other system so
84:25 this guy you don't see them in the same
84:27 photograph until you have a solar
84:30 eclipse and that the fact that these two
84:34 things are random distances from Earth
84:37 but when an eclipse occurs the moon
84:39 perfectly eclipses the Sun now somebody
84:41 wrote to me that it only 70 percent it
84:43 closes the Sun and that is complete
84:45 [ __ ] it's complete [ __ ] just do
84:47 a little bit of research on that and you
84:49 know finally that's not true but what do
84:51 they tell us about the moon's orbit the
84:54 moon's orbit has an elliptical orbit any
84:57 not circular meaning its distance from
84:59 the earth varies average distance to the
85:02 moon it's changed a little bit since I
85:04 was a kid but 236 to 237 somewhere in
85:07 there okay so the Sun is a fixed
85:12 distance from us because we have a
85:14 circular orbit actually someone said
85:17 recently it has elliptical orbit too so
85:19 it even it gets even more messy if the
85:21 earth had an elliptical orbit and the
85:23 moon is elliptical orbit then the solar
85:25 eclipse working every single time is
85:27 complete [ __ ] because you have this
85:30 ball in space call the Sun it's 93
85:33 million miles away and the moon is this
85:36 random you know [ __ ] distance this
85:38 much closer which is a much more
85:39 profound effect right something's really
85:42 really far away it barely parallax is
85:45 when you drive by it that's why the
85:47 stars always stay in the same place even
85:49 though we're hurtling through space
85:50 because if if the story is true of space
85:53 okay I know that a lot of us I mean an
85:56 episode called a space exists before
85:57 anybody else so don't lecture me about
86:00 space not existing I'm an OG believer in
86:04 that possibility but if it does exist
86:06 the way that they fable it to exist and
86:10 the stars are so far away
86:11 they're not gonna parallax just because
86:13 we're haulin ass through space they
86:15 won't come back and maybe a hundred
86:18 thousand years maybe if you moved a
86:20 little bit but you can't be you know
86:23 light-years away from something and have
86:25 a parallax it just doesn't do it but the
86:28 fact that this moon is the same size as
86:30 the Sun with these two random distances
86:34 I mean come on any of you've taken
86:38 statistics and probability you know I
86:41 think that the probability that that
86:44 would be the case would be
86:46 astronomically against and to add
86:49 another little variable to the whole
86:51 thing that we always see the same moon
86:53 surface because it's in some perfect
86:57 spin ratio such that we only ever see
87:00 that side of the moon you know if it was
87:04 off by just a tiny tiny bit since man
87:08 has been documenting what the moon looks
87:10 like we would have started to see a
87:13 little bit more of one side and a little
87:16 bit less than the other side nope it's
87:18 always the same always the same I think
87:21 within a hundred years we would start
87:23 seeing a new pixel on one side of the
87:26 moon if it was truly this random thing
87:29 in space right so when someone asked me
87:33 if it matters if we go to the moon I
87:37 would say for the flat earthers it
87:41 matters just getting into space and
87:43 seeing the shape of the earth because
87:46 for everybody's so sure it's a ball
87:48 again you just ask anyone we'll have you
87:50 seen it from space because that lying
87:53 organisation NASA sure as hell ain't
87:55 your your foothold in this whole thing
87:59 there fish islands crap during their
88:01 space walks are so sadly fish-eyed you
88:06 know the Mars rover excuse me the excuse
88:09 me the SpaceX Rover the Tesla Rover in
88:12 space that thing wasn't remotely far
88:15 enough away from Earth to have these
88:16 huge round ball Earth's in the
88:19 background no the big faux pas in their
88:22 part right you know I wouldn't send a
88:25 man any time soon but I would love to
88:29 see a launch where again we got that
88:32 little camera on the rocket so it never
88:34 ever goes out of sight remember this
88:36 whole Dead's dead point in the launch
88:39 where they say they can't communicate
88:41 with the rocket because of some anomaly
88:43 in the atmosphere that was invented so
88:46 they can switch the feeds on the video
88:50 during the hoax
88:52 so that's all [ __ ] we can keep it on
88:54 the whole time get it defeated hey even
88:57 if there's a blackout phase the camera
88:59 on the Rockets still going so the only
89:00 things gonna happen is we'll have a
89:01 buffer moment where we can't get the
89:03 data off the rocket down to ground
89:05 control which is why the buffer might be
89:07 I don't know I mean this stick put this
89:10 way the stick inside this camera is 64
89:13 gigs it can record two and a half
89:15 probably three hours and then it's dead
89:17 right it's full the blackout phase
89:20 doesn't last two hours so we can get all
89:24 the footage of the whole journey we'll
89:25 see the whole slingshot thing occur I
89:27 like to have a picture of the booster
89:29 and a picture of Earth to picture the
89:30 whole [ __ ] rocket from all different
89:32 sides so we can monitor it and then we
89:36 put that thing on the moon and we figure
89:39 out how they're doing it we will you
89:40 just you never lose sight of the thing
89:42 any retrorocket they're doing to slow
89:44 down the lander from this orbital
89:46 massive speed to do a nice little but I
89:49 want to see it I want to see every frame
89:51 of it and then I want to give it to
89:52 first I want a camera on the moon too as
89:55 soon as it launches because the moon is
89:56 always in the shot man and that list
89:58 goes on the back side earth but as soon
90:00 as we start going towards the moon
90:02 because of this magic something slot
90:04 slingshot theory I just want to see it
90:07 just gain more resolution more
90:09 resolution more resolution some guys
90:12 having a conversation with somebody his
90:14 in his car phone inside the car it's
90:17 super loud Nick in here little
90:19 conversation it's pretty funny soaked in
90:21 the whole neighborhood so you know I
90:23 want to see it I want to see some rover
90:25 plop out automated drive around and I
90:29 want them to land very very close to the
90:31 sea ekran tranquility landing of the
90:33 first moon mission the goal of the first
90:37 probe on Mars by the United States of
90:39 America with all of this continuously I
90:41 keep explaining and we must demand this
90:44 this technology be added to the rocket
90:47 it must be built with it right is that
90:50 we want to drive straight to the lunar
90:52 kickstand the lunar module kickstand I
90:55 want to see the American flag I want to
90:57 see every single footstep everything and
91:00 then we're gonna go to the other five
91:03 landings I want to see it all I'm
91:05 see how to terrains look exactly the
91:07 same between two different I want to see
91:11 you know what is it 15 16 17 had the
91:14 moon rover I want to see three separate
91:16 moon Rovers three separate states
91:19 that's why queuing on when he said that
91:21 we got to the moon the guy's a big
91:24 [ __ ] liar or stupid or gullible pick
91:29 one of those is right for sure
91:31 so the savior of the free world can't be
91:34 a liar right otherwise we're just
91:37 exchanging you know bad lies for good
91:41 lies and that's that's a big no-no and
91:45 the pure charter of the awakening so let
91:50 me know what you think about all this
91:52 your observations just you know for
91:57 those of you who want me to talk more
91:58 about this kind of stuff I am paying
92:00 attention but again the the data stream
92:03 from NASA has gone pretty dry the only
92:06 thing you do is wake up every day go to
92:08 their website look at all the crap it's
92:10 all the same propaganda and there's
92:12 really not a bunch of stuff to talk
92:13 about when they Forge more footage it
92:17 gives us a little bit of tech tech to
92:19 talk about when they give you a new
92:21 mission briefing about how they're gonna
92:23 put together new platform we can look at
92:26 that it buzz aldrin say something new
92:29 that's crazy we could talk about that
92:31 remember there is a video of him out
92:33 there and it's in a journalism video
92:35 it's embedded somewhere one of his
92:36 videos I have I can't get the guy to
92:38 respond to me where buzz said live on
92:41 television once we figure out how to go
92:43 to the moon it'll be a lot easier to get
92:46 to Mars and the people on the other side
92:49 of that news broadcast said what and
92:55 they got him off the air fairly quick
92:58 and supposedly although I'd never seen
93:00 this his people said he was tired I
93:03 never saw anyone say that he just
93:06 screwed up on TV and told the truth
93:08 because he's getting old God blessing so
93:12 pending something like that it's it is I
93:15 mean if you have a new angle you want me
93:16 to cover please share it because
93:19 I love talking about this stuff I just
93:21 don't want to bore the listeners you've
93:22 already heard it and I guess you know
93:27 I've been wanting to ask you guys do you
93:31 want me to repeat myself
93:32 I mean to go through it again maybe you
93:35 know if I did explain something twice
93:37 you know technically speaking I mean in
93:40 Episode five years ago number 26 and
93:43 then 165 about a year after that I have
93:48 definitely told the story
93:49 I don't know God a hundred times since
93:53 then to friends and people at this
93:55 lounge so I have perfected the way I
93:57 describe things a lot better in my
94:00 opinion so if if that's acceptable to
94:03 you too and you want that just let me
94:05 know I'll give you what you want if you
94:07 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
94:08 please go it's just a little website
94:11 that brings this whole thing together
94:13 and offers you the every means to get to
94:17 every episode plus a search engine plus
94:20 a category list I don't mention that
94:22 every single time but that's where you
94:25 know if the show would ever get shut off
94:27 for any reason which I you know
94:29 literally deep thoughts radio not being
94:31 turned off the only thing I could
94:32 imagine would be I don't have enough
94:34 subscribers to make it worth their while
94:36 they have a controversy on their hands
94:38 it is on [ __ ] shoot so the two videos
94:41 we channels we have is YouTube a [ __ ]
94:43 shoot that shoots right up to date I
94:45 haven't checked bright T on to see if I
94:46 got the 350 views that I needed I doubt
94:49 it but we'll see once we get that if you
94:53 count up I could put another 50 videos
94:55 up and I think that'll start making it
94:57 fairly organic to get the next whatever
94:59 thousand videos those of you dig
95:02 podcasting I do apologize I uh my my
95:07 pipeline looks like this so I recorded
95:09 on this camera now I got the mic
95:11 directly to the camera I have to pull
95:13 the soundtrack off and run it through
95:15 audition to get rid of some noise to
95:17 balance balance the vocals I tend to
95:20 lose my volume as the episode goes on so
95:22 if you look at the initial problem is
95:25 really high and it trails off especially
95:27 if I'm outside I think I get conscious
95:30 about you know we can up my neighbors at
95:31 3 a.m.
95:32 but I export that then I clean it all up
95:35 then I put it back into final cut and
95:36 mix the whole thing down into final cut
95:39 as a video episode getting rid of all
95:41 the long pauses cigar drags clearing my
95:44 throat or whatever and then I publish up
95:48 to you guys at 4k on YouTube then I have
95:53 to wait for that to fully encode to
95:54 1080p then I drag that down from YouTube
95:58 letting them do all the hard work for me
96:00 so it's a record on my home and then I
96:01 put that on [ __ ] to you because [ __ ]
96:02 you could only handle 1080p then I bring
96:06 it all back into [ __ ] there to audition
96:07 and balance just make it mono and I
96:12 export that on as a wave but the wave is
96:15 gigantic if I have audition credit an
96:18 mp3 the mp3 is too big and so then I
96:21 bring it into Amadeus Pro and then I
96:23 balanced the levels one more time for
96:25 podcast less and blow your eardrums out
96:28 and then I let Amadeus pro make the mp3
96:31 which is a very compact mp3 which is
96:35 what I use for you guys so that's why
96:37 the podcast traditionally is much later
96:41 broadcasts than the YouTube I'm not
96:43 trying to get people to forced into
96:46 watching things on YouTube but if you
96:50 are interested in seeing these things
96:51 right when they released you're gonna
96:53 have to subscribe and click the bell it
96:56 works really really well so I don't push
96:58 that stuff like a lot of other channels
97:00 and you know I'm gonna die saying well
97:03 god if I just push that the very
97:05 beginning I would have been able to
97:07 create probably a sustainable income off
97:09 this thing the show again it's down to
97:11 like 35 bucks a month on YouTube because
97:16 they're just literally ganking the whole
97:18 show down you know I've been pulled out
97:19 of all the algorithms and [ __ ] who
97:21 generates no money whatsoever the
97:25 patreon I haven't checked it but it's
97:27 about the same amount of money so if you
97:31 think I'm rolling in it because of the
97:32 show you're sadly mistaken again my
97:36 commitment to you would be if we can get
97:37 the show to blow up if you can pass it
97:39 all around with your recommendations and
97:41 again strategically you know I would say
97:44 recommend an episode that you think
97:45 someone
97:46 specific type would want to see but
97:48 definitely warned them hey it's a
97:50 variety show so not every episode be
97:52 your cup of tea but there's hundreds of
97:55 episodes so you know get onto the
97:57 website find the category that you dig
97:59 and everything's already in there in the
98:00 category list so that that should help
98:02 out quite a bit the search field is
98:04 awesome I just said someone asked me
98:05 tonight if I would do an episode on
98:07 JFK's plane crash which I may do that as
98:10 an exclusive thing but if you go to the
98:14 website and just typed in JFK in the
98:17 search engine you would have found the
98:18 episode that's called
98:19 as JFK still alive which will cover part
98:21 of the plane accident but not an
98:23 exhaustive detail like has been done
98:25 several times on YouTube I will say
98:28 there's a tremendous amount of
98:29 disinformation associated with that
98:33 plane crash so you know like I've been
98:37 told that he had the cast on his foot
98:38 the day he went on that flight and then
98:41 someone else came back and said no no he
98:43 had the cast pulled off his foot so it's
98:45 like okay how do you get that
98:47 information reliably there's not a lot
98:49 of articles saying what did you hear
98:51 today JFK lost his cast on his foot that
98:53 article doesn't exist so trying to find
98:55 the facts is real important for us
98:58 because we're trying to put the best
99:00 foot forward anyway we're on social
99:02 media as well so we have a locked
99:04 Facebook group we've got Twitter
99:05 Twitter's taken off like crazy the the
99:09 other one is mine's calm which I
99:11 personally think is absolutely gorgeous
99:13 it's a facebook copy oops it's a
99:15 Facebook copy but it is first time ever
99:18 protected like [ __ ] shoot so it's cool
99:20 I have heard a bunch of stuff about how
99:23 [ __ ] shoot is not first and protected
99:25 there's been some articles and
99:26 suggestions that's the case they've
99:29 never touched me in my videos and
99:31 YouTube has definitely touched my videos
99:33 right again on YouTube they D monetize
99:36 every video I post and what it is is
99:39 they're essentially robbing me of the
99:41 revenue so you know if I'm not doing a
99:45 NASA episode where it's gonna get into a
99:46 real organic search then I might get 650
99:50 in the first week but they will keep it
99:53 d monetize for 450 to 550 views and then
99:58 they Millau to monetize
100:00 by that time all of you have come
100:01 through no ads have ever played and so
100:03 all the revenues gone
100:05 the goal of revenue is to generate
100:07 enough that I can do nothing but the
100:10 show so just truly research a crap lot
100:13 of stuff really put a lot of photographs
100:15 in now if I had the time I would do
100:17 episodes where I would hire somebody
100:19 else just like you see in most shows
100:21 like Joe Rogan or whatever where
100:23 someone's pulling up images for
100:25 everything that I've discussed and so I
100:26 can just tell them hey you know just
100:29 listen to the episode and I mentioned
100:31 something go find the picture of the
100:32 Georgia Guidestones put it on there
100:34 I mentioned JFK put a nice picture of
100:36 him there but Papa and we can make much
100:39 better episodes but we are we are
100:42 several thousand orders away from that
100:44 occurring so it probably will never
100:46 occur before I end the show and maybe
100:47 create a different show the other thing
100:51 is supporting the page so financially
100:53 supporting the page there's one time
100:54 PayPal link up there there is patreon
100:58 which is monthly subscription again with
100:59 patreon you get in the credits you have
101:02 a 20% discount on the store and you get
101:04 these episodes given to you the
101:06 literally the second I upload them from
101:08 my computer I post it up there with a
101:10 three day delay for the public to see it
101:12 so you get to see it literally the
101:14 second encodes sometimes you'll be able
101:16 to hang on to an episode and see it
101:18 three days before everybody else or you
101:21 will get to see at least a few hours
101:24 before everybody else you get the
101:26 preview for there if I waited a really
101:28 long time to post an episode it's really
101:30 quick so so design codes I pushed it out
101:32 there because I'm trying to get the you
101:34 know the general audience out there
101:35 there's no way that I know of to give
101:37 anyone a secret podcast link so it's
101:40 only gonna be video unfortunately
101:42 because there's just no methodology to
101:43 create a secret podcast and only give it
101:47 to a couple people that'll be very
101:49 surgical and a lot of work for me
101:52 because I have to create two different
101:53 podcast feeds but there is a store with
101:56 a cold to to like UFO t-shirts they're
101:59 gonna be season five two t-shirts only
102:01 so as soon as the season's over they'll
102:03 disappear forever and we'll make
102:05 something new for season six if you're
102:09 trying to find episode one Ferriss
102:12 season one scuse me I
102:13 season thing season one stuff has been
102:16 pushed off on its own channel because
102:17 it's all been remastered shorter better
102:20 volumes balanced all that good stuff
102:23 how's the big bumper yeah so anyway take
102:26 care of yourself and someone else and
102:28 I'll see you in the next deep thoughts
102:29 over now
