00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen i just got done editing the uh
00:41 evp episode i'm also redoing the intros
00:46 quality a little bit some of the uh
00:51 well i was bashful about running uh
00:53 what's called a denoise filter on it to
00:55 smooth out the frames
00:57 and uh freaking hoods are all mixed up
01:01 so i uh re-ran them through
01:04 blender to give them de-noise i'll
01:06 smooth everything out a little bit
01:08 maybe do some color correction whatever
01:10 just bothers me when i see it on a
01:13 tv and i see all those pixels
01:16 sorry so you know my last episode
01:20 my little fireside chat
01:24 i talked about the way that history gets
01:27 assassinated as soon as it's created
01:30 and i thought we would run with that
01:31 theme because it is obviously something
01:33 that happens
01:36 it's 46 degrees out i don't know what my
01:38 deal is i
01:39 just have a fascination with freezing to
01:40 death so let me ask you a question
01:43 this will really work well with
01:45 americans not so much
01:47 with europeans i don't think but if you
01:49 ever travel to another country
01:52 and you find out that that everything
01:54 that they know
01:55 everything that they're being told about
01:56 a particular subject is almost entirely
01:59 different
02:00 than the one you're told and then you
02:02 come back home you're like
02:03 my god we live in two worlds they're
02:05 getting told something completely
02:06 different
02:08 and it just changes your views i have a
02:09 lot of friends who are soldiers
02:12 have been in the theater of war
02:15 especially with the 2003 to the
02:19 election of donald trump when those wars
02:22 were concluded soldiers friends of mine
02:26 would say they'd come home and they'd
02:28 see stuff on the news
02:29 cnn especially and they would hear about
02:32 this huge firefight that just happened
02:35 and that they
02:36 are they're embedded with the troops and
02:38 here's the footage
02:41 and my buddies are like yeah that
02:43 happened last year
02:45 and that was a training exercise and now
02:48 someone's
02:49 just lying to the public fake news
02:53 i went to england let's see in uh
02:57 i think it was junish
03:01 of 2000. and the oj simpson thing was
03:05 still a fascination with the world
03:07 not heavy duty but it was still in the
03:09 news you know because he kept
03:10 getting sued by ron goldman's group or
03:13 family you know
03:14 rightfully so and
03:17 i sat in a hotel and i was in jet lag
03:21 and so i was up i had slept during the
03:23 evening and i woke up at like three in
03:24 the morning
03:25 and so i turn on this television and i
03:27 just love british television
03:29 over there especially because their
03:30 commercials are so much better than ours
03:32 man
03:35 believe it or not their marketing is
03:37 more genuine at least it was 20 years
03:39 ago
03:39 to the point i would buy something just
03:41 based on a commercial
03:42 but i got caught up in this documentary
03:45 of which
03:46 i watched all the way through
03:49 and it said that and i've never heard
03:52 this story anywhere in the freaking
03:54 world over here i mean you could talk to
03:56 norah mcdonnelly would know this story
03:58 and he's the guy
03:59 got fired for making fun of o.j on snl
04:01 news right
04:03 this story said that ron goldman
04:07 was a waiter at his restaurant
04:11 nicole had come and visited him
04:14 of course they kind of chit-chatted a
04:15 little closer than normal because
04:16 they're dating
04:18 she leaves something behind he takes it
04:20 to her place
04:21 and obviously she gets her throat
04:23 slashed and he gets his chest
04:25 stabbed horribly
04:28 did you ever ask yourself how
04:32 would they know how would oj know that
04:34 those two people are there
04:36 i mean you could want to kill your wife
04:37 all you want but how do you know exactly
04:39 where she's gonna be
04:40 you can't just be o.j simpson and i
04:43 don't care if you're in a frog outfit
04:45 you can't
04:46 just sit there and wait you're o.j
04:49 simpson
04:50 and you're a black guy so you know like
04:52 la will just jump on you and it's a nice
04:54 neighborhood
04:55 and so what would you do you know oh
04:57 yeah i'm just
04:58 dressed in a cat burglars outfit and i'm
05:00 o.j simpson you just can't sit around
05:02 you got to be there right when it
05:03 happens
05:04 well this documentary solved that
05:06 problem so oj has two sets of kids
05:09 i believe a son and a daughter from the
05:11 first wife and a son or daughter from
05:12 nicole
05:13 two little kids if you've heard of this
05:16 tell me because i mentioned this to
05:18 friends around here and they're just
05:19 like
05:21 you were on crack or something right
05:23 they said that o.j simpson's older son
05:26 was a chef
05:28 at that restaurant that the goldman kid
05:31 was working at
05:33 and that he was the one that called his
05:37 father and
05:38 said oh my god they're all over each
05:39 other you know we need to take these
05:41 guys out and what have you
05:44 as well they said now if this is
05:47 completely untrue and i
05:49 apologize true or false trust me
05:52 but they said that his son already had a
05:55 previous
05:56 conviction charge something at least a
05:58 charge
05:59 for stabbing someone in the chest
06:01 several times not fatally
06:03 but he has an anger issue and knife
06:05 seemed to be his way of killing
06:08 so here's ryan goldman he's coming back
06:09 to nicole's place
06:12 and of course uh so what they said what
06:15 they insinuated was
06:16 oj took out nicole and his son took out
06:19 ron i believe that's the name right
06:23 but it was massively detailed and it was
06:26 like everything you never saw in
06:28 any of the information over here
06:30 especially the court
06:33 and i'm sitting looking at this going
06:35 how is it this
06:36 is on tv over here and it's not over in
06:38 america i mean we eat that stuff
06:40 up more so than the british i'm sure
06:44 history you know it's almost like
06:47 history is not history
06:52 it is simply a weapon to utterly and
06:56 completely
06:57 program you the way they want you to
06:59 believe
07:00 you exist in this world and that may not
07:03 sound profound to you
07:04 some of you some of you might be like
07:07 what
07:08 but history just history in this world
07:12 because it is taught to you history can
07:16 only be yours if you lived it but let's
07:18 say a little kid
07:20 you're born and people start telling you
07:22 things
07:24 you ever have that relative that always
07:25 lied to you when you're a little kid to
07:27 tell you little things like
07:28 my grandfather said um well if you eat
07:31 your crust
07:33 or if you don't eat your crust on your
07:35 bread you will never know how to whistle
07:38 prom for him is already know how to do
07:39 it but don't cross your eyes it'll stay
07:42 that way this is like
07:45 there's a hairy palm in there somewhere
07:48 all these things who is the bad guys
07:51 who's the good guys
07:53 hmm you never hear a war story i mean
07:56 like i don't know any war story where
08:00 after someone beat someone the winner
08:04 says well to the children you know like
08:06 60 years later goes
08:07 well it was a very unfortunate war that
08:09 we simply had to fight because we had a
08:11 disagreeance
08:12 right that's how you have an argument
08:14 described to you between your parents
08:16 after it's over but no one would ever
08:20 say
08:21 well you know those germans
08:24 got a leader and that leader had an
08:26 objective and
08:28 we can play you hours and hours of his
08:30 speeches
08:32 we can show you videos and testimony
08:36 eyewitness even from germans the bad
08:39 things happen
08:41 but you know we just had a philosophical
08:43 difference and we just had to fight it
08:44 out
08:45 never ever is it like that they tell you
08:51 in many cases in history especially
08:53 associated with war and especi
08:55 especially associated with dictators
08:58 lies about what the dictators are trying
09:01 to do
09:03 now sometimes the dictators truly are
09:05 nut cases that kind of need to be
09:07 corrected
09:08 meaning removed from planet earth
09:11 but we know from like muammar gaddafi
09:17 he was going to create a gold-backed
09:18 dinar allying
09:21 allying all the countries in africa and
09:23 the continent of africa
09:25 to pool their infinite supply it seems
09:28 of diamonds and gold and all the
09:30 emeralds and all those
09:32 uranium and all the resources to back
09:36 this new dinar he had amassed a
09:38 tremendous amount of gold
09:40 and during the obama administration led
09:43 by hillary clinton
09:45 currently they send in our special
09:47 forces illegally
09:49 they find out where he is they capture
09:50 him with our forces hand them over to
09:52 the local forces
09:53 and then start rolling the video camera
09:56 where they destroy this guy
09:57 on camera and you're to believe
10:00 everything you've ever heard about this
10:01 ben
10:02 now you may uh have this weird
10:06 line in your mind that you may not even
10:09 know you have when it comes to history
10:12 let's say you're red pill today and you
10:15 know about a lot of things for the last
10:16 20 years especially
10:18 starting one year into this century
10:21 a particular day and fall
10:25 and so you probably have a much better
10:28 grasp of
10:29 recent history because you're living it
10:31 you have alternate
10:32 sources to find out what's actually
10:34 going on you got boots on the ground
10:36 somewhere
10:37 if not a bunch of different places
10:38 meaning people you know
10:40 who are in new york or in l.a who are in
10:42 these places
10:43 the little thing that's going on here in
10:45 2020. how many times of the news said
10:47 that a particular hospital was
10:49 packed and then people just walked down
10:51 to their hospital and walked inside
10:53 the video camera and said there's nobody
10:55 here
10:56 okay so you feel pretty good those last
10:58 20 years of red pilling
11:01 it depending how old you are depending
11:03 how much you've been chasing this whole
11:05 try to figure out the world thing it
11:08 only bleeds slightly back
11:11 to the previous century you get little
11:14 drops of lucidity within the last
11:17 century
11:18 you find out the titanic didn't sink it
11:20 was the olympic
11:21 you find out what the 16th amendment was
11:23 about you find out who flanders knox was
11:25 who helped draft the thing he was the
11:27 attorney for the rothschilds
11:28 rockefellers
11:29 carnegies vanderbilts but those are just
11:33 little tiny tidbits along the way
11:36 you don't have what you have today and
11:39 so if i say hey you know they
11:41 they really crossed the line when they
11:44 killed muammar qaddafi
11:46 now if you're old enough if you're old
11:48 let's say 40 and over you may remember
11:51 the lockerbie downing
11:54 of the jet there was this huge you know
11:56 they captured one of his guys and then
11:58 eventually got him brought back home to
12:00 libya
12:01 because they keep mass murderers alive
12:03 that's always and they always give them
12:05 back to their
12:06 to their leaders under some code of
12:08 diplomatic blah blah blah
12:10 i remember now seeing the video seeing
12:12 the pictures excuse me of the bodies
12:13 that fell out of that plane
12:15 and now because of the events that
12:17 happened in this century
12:19 and doing a lot of studying and talking
12:21 to a lot of pilots
12:23 and watching documentaries and really
12:26 it's just the people i talk to
12:28 i know that the pictures that i saw
12:30 which could be
12:32 not real pictures could be you know just
12:35 to soften the blow to my
12:36 little heart every every human body i
12:40 saw was completely intact
12:42 wearing their clothes drop
12:45 drooped over you know wire fences and
12:47 stuff
12:48 you don't get that capability if a plane
12:51 is
12:52 blown up if it hits even you know
12:56 250 miles an hour which i think a
12:57 jetliner has to hit about 230 to take
13:00 off
13:01 safely your clothes are going to get
13:03 ripped off your body if you get
13:05 outside the fuselage it just will happen
13:08 i didn't see any burned bodies i didn't
13:09 see
13:10 guts i didn't see anything strange like
13:13 well anything that matches the other
13:14 photos i've seen of
13:16 horrific plane accidents that plane
13:19 happened and they went and attacked him
13:20 didn't they
13:21 way back in the 80s and then he started
13:24 went whoa
13:25 okay i get you i get you and then when
13:28 that event happened this
13:30 first year of the century the dude was
13:32 smart he's like
13:33 hey whatever help you need i'll give you
13:35 money i'll give you resources
13:37 you can stage out of my country whatever
13:39 you need
13:40 but this quote unquote bad guy
13:43 was going to be competing with the most
13:46 powerful
13:46 control apparatus it's almost like what
13:49 uh val kilmer's batman
13:51 where they had that i think it was like
13:53 a broadcast wave it's been in several
13:55 movies
13:55 where you have like a an antenna that's
13:58 broadcasting on everybody controlling
13:59 all their minds
14:02 they killed this dude and stole his gold
14:06 billions and billions of dollars worth
14:08 of his gold
14:10 and we kind of go yeah i mean like most
14:13 most grown men that i know are alpha
14:14 male
14:15 cowboys they saw that video of him being
14:18 tortured by his people
14:21 and it was interesting they just uh they
14:24 didn't jump on board they were like man
14:25 it's awful
14:26 they must be sending a message to the
14:28 rest of the world don't mess with us
14:31 otherwise we'll do what we did to him to
14:34 you
14:34 or we'll do worse i wonder
14:37 to myself how many societies are sitting
14:41 in their homes this is sort of a
14:45 ridiculous joke or question rhetorical
14:48 question
14:50 how many people are sitting in their
14:51 living rooms thinking we're the bad guys
14:53 oh man it's so fun being a bad guy
14:57 we're gonna do bad guy things when we do
14:59 a war it's unwarranted we just
15:02 do it you screw all those people
15:06 hey i don't think anybody thinks that
15:11 think the only times i've ever heard two
15:14 countries in
15:15 in the last century
15:18 go through this was apparently japan
15:21 according to
15:22 according to the artist murakami who's
15:25 i think just a genius he's a genius as a
15:29 philosopher
15:30 in addition to being just a beautiful
15:32 artist
15:34 and sculptor and all this other stuff he
15:35 has a lot of people help him do stuff
15:36 today because he just has more concepts
15:38 than he can execute and he's like
15:39 what do you want me to do just crank out
15:41 what i can crank out
15:42 i want to build a statue that's um two
15:46 stories high made a platinum
15:48 i need help i don't know how to move
15:49 platinum that much but i know what i
15:50 wanted to look like
15:53 but he told a story in his book that i
15:56 bought
15:56 at mocha here in l.a after seeing his
16:00 exhibit i didn't see him unfortunately
16:03 he said the japan was so ashamed
16:06 the people of what their government did
16:08 during world war
16:09 ii especially pearl harbor and you know
16:11 whatever
16:13 that they went cute right after the war
16:18 and that place is just a living cartoon
16:22 i if there's one asian country i go to
16:24 in my lifetime i want it to be japan
16:27 i so want to go there they're just
16:30 technologists they're artists i mean so
16:32 many of the movies we have in our world
16:34 we ripped off from their
16:36 story lines i mean cowboy bebop give me
16:38 a break
16:40 just amazing gundam was it uh
16:43 yamamoto all these amazing [ __ ] anime
16:46 things they're just
16:47 incredible culture so they did it
16:51 i just watched a video last night
16:55 which was i think japan 1919
16:59 someone restored some old footage
17:02 and i don't know what city was in it did
17:04 say but it was like a kind of a silent
17:06 movie sort of thing where it would break
17:07 and show you slides like a silent movie
17:09 used to do
17:11 and they were very primitive
17:16 for compared to where they are today
17:17 it's astonishing
17:19 the leap the japanese culture went from
17:22 1919 to 2019
17:25 it is tint amount to being visited by
17:28 ufos and given technology but they
17:30 earned every bit of it themselves
17:32 and you have to remember they had a city
17:33 flattened
17:35 amazing the other country was germany
17:40 germany was extremely shamed by
17:44 world war ii
17:47 now apparently you have and i know
17:49 there's again there's tremendous
17:50 disputes about the
17:52 holocaust and the exact number of people
17:53 who died and
17:55 there's a there is a jewish kid that was
17:59 on donahue several times we had to go
18:00 into hiding which i believe he's out of
18:02 hiding now
18:04 but he visited all the concentration
18:06 camps and he just said this is not true
18:10 he's not saying hundreds of thousands of
18:11 people didn't die
18:13 but not millions that's his assertion
18:16 and
18:17 man he he flattened donahue and the
18:21 i guess done who had a rabbi or
18:23 historian or something with him and
18:26 it was amazing what they were talking
18:28 about in the 80s and just never went
18:29 anywhere
18:31 but regardless it was a horrible
18:33 situation
18:34 but the citizens i think had no idea
18:37 whether or not it was true or not
18:40 and so german men were castrating
18:44 themselves
18:44 chemically if not physically
18:48 for decades after that war all the way
18:51 up into the 70s
18:52 from the last report i heard from this
18:54 is like first degree
18:56 reporting to me where a friend of mine
19:00 was dating
19:00 people in the 70s and
19:04 i would assume even into the early early
19:06 80s and she would
19:07 fall in love with the guy and find out
19:09 he had done this to himself and he said
19:10 yeah a bunch of my friends did it
19:12 because we don't think our genes should
19:13 continue it's like hey man
19:17 if you feel that passionate about
19:20 neutralizing your nuts then i think you
19:22 probably aren't the guy we're worried
19:23 about
19:24 your genes can move forward it's if you
19:26 thought it was awesome
19:28 and that we should do it again we should
19:30 take care of your nads right
19:33 but what if any part of that story isn't
19:36 true
19:37 and the guys went and got rid of their
19:38 ability to procreate
19:41 i'm just giving you some low-hanging
19:43 fruit here that i know of
19:46 how do you think the kim family has so
19:48 survived in north korea
19:51 i mean they're just three dudes man and
19:54 only one of them is really active at any
19:55 one point in time
19:58 now we know that the black hats are in
20:00 there
20:01 doing all their stuff but way before
20:05 that infiltration ever occurred
20:08 they tell you that their leader
20:11 uh has done so many miracles that jesus
20:13 needs to lay down and take a nap
20:16 history it is the matrix
20:20 it is the matrix
20:24 think about another factor
20:28 the speed at which history was
20:30 transcribed
20:31 versus the speed of which history is now
20:33 transcribed
20:35 modified revised romanticized
20:39 corrupted well it used to take a little
20:43 while for a book to be written about
20:44 something
20:45 you know world war ii is over in 1945
20:48 it wouldn't necessarily be 1946 when you
20:51 have the first book released about
20:53 the incredible events that occurred
20:56 today well the book writes itself
20:59 pretty much in the wake of any event
21:02 occurring
21:04 as soon as you walk down the street well
21:06 right behind you is the guy
21:07 transcribing you like the dude and was
21:10 it uh
21:12 tombstone the duck of death oh sorry
21:16 it's the duke
21:17 i said duck so now they're kind of
21:20 buttoning up
21:21 the matrix as you experience it
21:26 they're pouring everything in concrete
21:29 cutting everything out of giant
21:31 limestone so that it won't move man
21:34 and then of course they indoctrinate our
21:36 children from the second they are
21:38 born remember the movie the village
21:42 i was it shame a ding dang that guy's
21:44 name that's my joke because i can never
21:46 remember his name
21:48 well that's basically how you'd have to
21:50 raise your kids these days if you want
21:51 to keep them
21:52 from being absolutely corrupted i mean i
21:55 think the amish have it
21:57 have something down pat man i think they
21:59 should
22:00 probably adopt a little bit more
22:02 technology for their
22:05 convenience but maybe not the
22:08 not the devices that bring in
22:10 information
22:11 and media and that way they can have uh
22:15 i don't know a little blender make a
22:17 shake a little faster you know what i'm
22:18 saying
22:20 they use terms to
22:24 hide their nefarious act right
22:27 the patriot act um
22:32 affordable care act hilarious man right
22:37 if they're saying the word affordable
22:39 then you have to invert it
22:40 because they're satanists if they say
22:43 patriotic
22:44 it's anything but it's treasonistic
22:48 how is it they always have these things
22:50 always ready every time something occurs
22:53 that event happened in 2001
22:57 man the patriot acts all ready to go
22:59 it's over 11 000 pages according to ron
23:02 paul
23:02 who was the only dude plus kucinich who
23:04 read the thing but you had to go get all
23:06 the outside reference documentation
23:09 agenda 21 slash agenda 2030. what's the
23:12 theme of that whole thing
23:14 it's a sustainable living
23:17 you read the website it's oh we are so
23:20 good
23:22 it makes you wonder when you look at you
23:23 know modern religion
23:25 today and i'm gonna
23:28 i'm gonna say this but i want you to
23:30 separate in your mind right from the
23:31 very beginning
23:33 if you believe christ existed on this
23:35 planet and was the son of god
23:37 take before i say this take a fork in
23:40 the road
23:41 and jesus goes right on his own true
23:44 history journey
23:45 of what he truly meant and what he truly
23:47 said then take the catholic church and
23:49 go left
23:51 imagine that whatever
23:54 they're telling you to do is the
23:55 opposite of what you should do
23:58 or it's 90 percent
24:01 of what he said but they put that little
24:03 10 percent in there
24:06 and they know that 10 percent will
24:08 compromise your soul
24:11 let's just rewind to us being little
24:13 kids
24:16 isn't it interesting that if you have a
24:18 fairly good historic memory
24:20 you're not challenged in any way shape
24:22 or form as soon as you learn history you
24:24 just put it in your
24:26 photographic memory of slides in your
24:29 brain
24:30 that's the civil war that's a
24:31 revolutionary war war of 1812 blah blah
24:33 blah
24:35 sorry i only have american references
24:38 the germanians attacking the romans
24:41 and you build in your mind almost just a
24:44 comfort
24:46 of where you are
24:50 and maybe where you might be going in
24:52 the end
24:53 i believe the first twilight zone to air
24:55 and there's two that have this theme in
24:57 it
24:58 the first twilight zone to air is that
25:00 dude who was the uh
25:02 the cook and forbidden planet great
25:04 actor
25:05 he wakes up in a city well little town
25:07 little twilight zone town
25:09 a little country town he goes into a
25:12 diner real quick and
25:14 he's got a little jumpsuit on and the
25:17 jukebox is blaring
25:18 he's like hey god you may want to turn
25:20 this down a little bit you know and he's
25:21 got paying customer here a paint
25:22 customer
25:24 and he goes back and nobody's there but
25:27 he goes back in the kitchen
25:28 there's a hot pot of coffee he pours
25:29 himself coffee and he's like hey you
25:31 know
25:32 where are you or you know i'm taking
25:33 some coffee here and he's got i got two
25:35 dollars and
25:36 47 cents you know paying customers let's
25:39 get some ham and eggs in here man and he
25:42 just keeps
25:42 wandering around he finally thinks he
25:44 sees a lady in the truck and turns out
25:46 she's a mannequin
25:48 he sits down talks to her it's really
25:50 cute but in the end he just goes
25:52 nuts because he has no reference to who
25:53 he is he thinks he's in the air force
25:56 doesn't know his name and you find out
25:58 that he's in a deprivation tank
26:02 experimenting for the trip to the moon
26:04 and beyond
26:06 it's very brilliant for the early 60s
26:08 man
26:09 the other one is that there's a cylinder
26:12 this dude wakes up this one actually won
26:15 emmys
26:16 stu wakes up and i think he's in sort of
26:18 some military uniform
26:20 but he looks he looks around he wakes up
26:22 and he doesn't know where the hell he is
26:24 and nor do i think he knows who he is
26:27 and there's a clown in there there's a
26:29 ballerina
26:31 there's just some weird folks in there
26:33 and he's he's like okay where am i who
26:35 are you guys and
26:38 he looks up in the cylinder and there's
26:40 like a
26:41 a ledge up there but it's really really
26:42 high and so he's like we got to get out
26:44 of here
26:45 and they're like no you can't get out of
26:46 here you just can't
26:48 and so the the thing is that they're all
26:50 toys
26:52 inside a container but if you really
26:55 read the subtext
26:56 of the message it's
27:00 essentially rod sterling or whoever
27:02 wrote that particular episode
27:03 saying to you disorientation
27:06 of who you are through some amnesia
27:08 moment
27:10 is more devastating than you actually
27:12 realize
27:15 because we have solitude that we know
27:17 who we are
27:18 we know our name we know our parents
27:21 some of you have parents you absolutely
27:22 adore some of you are glad
27:25 they're different people now we build
27:28 this up
27:29 to give ourselves a sense of who we are
27:32 but what if it's all fake
27:35 what if it's like i said it's massacred
27:37 the second it's created
27:38 now let's dial back 150 years and look
27:41 at the press before the
27:43 hearst corporation came around to
27:44 destroy it
27:47 before the rothschilds founded the
27:49 reuters i think in
27:50 the mid 1850s you would have something
27:54 happen
27:54 let's say in the united states because
27:56 we had been dragging
27:58 telegraph lines around quite a bit at
28:00 least by
28:01 say the 1870s it was a pretty good
28:03 artery to get information
28:06 none of the uh you know telegraphers
28:09 really knew each other much they'd
28:10 probably chat right between maybe
28:12 we're there and the next one down but
28:14 they wouldn't know the next one next one
28:15 you know
28:16 but something happens there's a fire in
28:18 chicago
28:20 there's perhaps an earthquake in san
28:21 francisco and this information is being
28:23 tapped out as quick as it happened
28:26 and it's not going through an editor
28:28 it's not going through a newspaper it's
28:29 it's
28:30 telegrams being sent like emails except
28:33 you don't have big tech on top of you
28:34 deleting them
28:36 you don't have big tech censoring your
28:38 communication with each other because it
28:40 happens to
28:42 conflict with their agenda 2030 kill the
28:45 entire world agenda
28:48 by the way you know that's their plan
28:50 but
28:51 i don't know why they're going through
28:52 all the trouble to create chaos for
28:54 themselves
28:55 10 years before everybody's supposed to
28:57 be dead doesn't make any sense to me
28:58 why reset the economy right now i mean
29:00 why do it
29:02 just whatever day you're going to nail
29:04 everybody you do it that day and then
29:06 you just clean up the mess afterwards
29:08 and then do whatever you want with the
29:10 economy
29:11 so the amount of effort they're putting
29:13 in right now sort of negates
29:16 the sensibility that they're going to
29:18 get their way or that they really want
29:20 that super extreme
29:21 position which is good because that
29:24 means that we'll still be around
29:27 and we can make more change if we don't
29:29 turn into a bunch of [ __ ]
29:32 but let's just do the experiment in the
29:35 inverse
29:36 we know that we wake up as little kids
29:39 and you know first circle of influence
29:41 we're told about is our family well
29:43 that's what grandpa did and this is what
29:44 grandma does and
29:46 this is where we live and this is who
29:47 helped found the city blah blah
29:51 and then you learn about your local city
29:53 then the state than the country than the
29:55 world
29:55 typically in that order but now let's
29:57 say that we do
29:58 a little bit of that twilight zone
30:00 episode
30:02 except there's one profound difference
30:04 you know who you are
30:06 you know your first name your last name
30:08 you know what you do for a living
30:10 you kind of remember your life although
30:13 i'm gonna mess with you i let you
30:16 remember
30:16 just the very specifics of where you
30:19 have been in your life
30:20 but i don't let you remember anything
30:22 you've ever read about something you
30:23 haven't experienced
30:25 so if you read something in a newspaper
30:27 that you didn't experience
30:29 it's gone from your mind scientific
30:31 method and
30:33 trade skills you can keep those but
30:37 the fact that there's a country called
30:38 germany you don't know
30:42 imagine you wake up whatever age you are
30:45 right now the older this is more
30:46 significant and interesting to me
30:48 and you don't know anything i want you
30:51 to think about how
30:53 your sensibility would be disembodied by
30:56 that experience
30:58 what would be your next thing and let's
31:02 say i keep you away from electronic
31:03 equipment
31:05 and you have to go talk to people about
31:07 things
31:09 slow you down just a tad now you're
31:10 running in water like a nice dream
31:14 i think that would be extremely
31:15 disorienting
31:17 like psychotic fit perhaps for some
31:20 people
31:21 who won't see it as a you know oh my god
31:23 this is wild
31:25 so take that anxiety if you have any
31:30 take that sort of epiphany of its
31:34 destruction to your sensibilities
31:36 and your sense of security as to where
31:39 are you
31:40 who's who who's good who's bad
31:44 are these your people are they not your
31:45 people gosh i don't know
31:47 where'd you come from are you indian are
31:48 you german are you asian where you come
31:50 from
31:52 and and if they say oh you know you're
31:54 from germany and they or you're from
31:56 you're aboriginal you know you're from
31:58 australia
31:59 and be like okay who are they
32:03 i take it all it's all gone
32:06 so now the question is that tells you
32:10 how value
32:11 valuable the history is to you
32:15 that you have and then
32:18 if we put the sticker on top of it that
32:21 says complete
32:22 bs right on top of that security bubble
32:26 that is giving you a sense of who you
32:28 are
32:29 because you know you've been lied to a
32:31 lot
32:33 then you'll get my drift
32:38 of how much this is the matrix but let's
32:41 not forget
32:42 another tactic that's going on there's a
32:45 certain political party that's trying to
32:47 erase
32:48 races they're trying to race races off
32:52 of
32:52 logos commercial products under the
32:56 pretense that they're doing an
32:57 anti-racism move when what they're
33:01 really doing is the most racist thing
33:02 you've ever heard in your life
33:04 erasing heroes erasing the
33:08 very acknowledgement and the existence
33:11 of various races themselves
33:14 miss greene otherwise known as anja mimo
33:18 uncle ben was a fake character but is
33:21 named after the guy who was supplying
33:22 all the
33:23 rice so angie mama has to get pulled off
33:26 her thing i think they won that battle
33:28 though
33:28 i think the family was like what are you
33:30 talking about
33:33 but paul newman's brands well they never
33:35 got
33:36 questioned at all did they over
33:38 redenbacher
33:40 he doesn't get any problems and you
33:43 might say oh but that's because it's not
33:44 a racial slur
33:46 well i'll give you that with ange mima
33:49 that was definitely sort of a
33:51 racial slur in the 1800s but what was
33:54 what i tell you guys was like 59 years
33:56 old or something like that
33:57 she went and won the prize for her
34:00 pancake
34:01 mix and syrup mix she was amazing
34:07 they don't want to rename her to her
34:09 name
34:11 this green sauce or something like that
34:15 nope they want to get rid of her
34:16 completely native americans are going to
34:18 be erased from everything
34:20 simply because they can and they're
34:23 going to leverage this whole thing
34:26 the redskins up in washington are going
34:28 to turn into a potato
34:30 that's from my friend carla it's a great
34:32 joke but they go backwards nowadays
34:35 don't they
34:37 they go backwards and they will write a
34:39 book that says something like
34:41 um well you know this is why
34:44 this person was more angelic
34:48 than we previously thought or this
34:51 person was more evil than we previously
34:53 thought
34:55 now we do have some wins every once in a
34:57 while hitler escaping to argentina
35:00 the documentaries that have been made in
35:01 the last five years about that
35:04 subject are in my mind utterly
35:06 conclusive
35:08 and a bunch of celebrities have been
35:09 joking about like i said mel brooks
35:11 joked about it on
35:12 the dick cavett show and it was i
35:16 think i'm correct in saying this and i
35:18 apologize if i'm not because i hate to
35:19 create little
35:21 uh tidbits that aren't true but i
35:23 believe when you watch
35:24 mel brooks's face when he says it
35:27 he says well of course he you know he
35:29 escaped argentina and that crowd laughs
35:31 because it's mel brooks and he's just
35:33 funny when he reads a period
35:35 i think if he watches his eyes he kind
35:36 of turns to the crowd and he kind of
35:38 like
35:38 slips his eyes like well it's true he
35:41 kind of has that look on his face you
35:42 know
35:44 that's the way i read it anyway can't
35:46 release that information for some reason
35:48 because i guess that little trick
35:50 doesn't want to get exposed
35:52 well we don't even know saddam hussein
35:54 got on a chinook right in front of the
35:56 reuters press and then they staged the
35:59 event where he's in the hole and then
36:01 they staged the event where they hung
36:02 him
36:02 they staged the event when they show you
36:04 this ridiculous prosthetic on his
36:07 neck while this photographer gets a
36:10 chance to walk into a hospital i believe
36:11 in jordan or something
36:14 and without any guards protecting
36:16 saddam's body on a
36:18 on a it wasn't really a gurney but like
36:20 one of those tables
36:22 he's allowed to walk up and lift the
36:24 sheet off and show you the neck and
36:26 close it up
36:27 yeah because you know you know we don't
36:29 protect bodies or anything by military
36:31 force
36:32 there's no hay you can't be playing with
36:34 bodies and oh guess what
36:36 a dead body is stored in room
36:37 temperature with sun on it
36:40 because that's just you know hey we
36:42 don't know anything about how morgues
36:43 work
36:45 history i mentioned it several times
36:48 i think already this year but i just saw
36:51 another
36:52 it was really sad too because graham
36:54 hancock
36:55 was he's a great guy i mean he's an
36:57 amazing dude who's who's
37:00 responsible for sort of revising history
37:03 closer at least to probably what was
37:05 true
37:07 in the uh all of the the archaeological
37:10 dig areas from egypt to machu picchu and
37:13 everything
37:15 the one in turkey the one south africa
37:18 but he has a recent presentation video
37:21 that just came out and this is december
37:22 of 2020
37:25 and he's talking about things and he's
37:26 doing a great job but he mentions
37:30 stonehenge and he starts talking about
37:31 he just completely glazes over the fact
37:33 that it was moved and reconstructed in
37:35 1954.
37:37 okay so we have 110 photographs we now
37:39 have movies
37:40 watching them do this at least mention
37:44 it you know you don't have to re
37:45 you know rake anyone over the coals or
37:47 anything but come on at least say well
37:50 when it was restored in 1954
37:51 which is a good thing they did move it
37:54 you know
37:55 maybe a couple miles from where it was
37:57 or maybe even just a mile or maybe even
37:58 tenth of a mile but they moved it onto
38:00 another circle and they repaired all
38:01 those stones that's why they have cement
38:05 underneath the stones i mean people go
38:06 and visit apparently you can't go up to
38:08 it anymore
38:10 without some appointment or something
38:12 like anyone's going to hurt the stones
38:14 now or something really funny
38:17 and you see all the cement in the bottom
38:19 of these stones and you're like
38:21 you're just like oh yeah i guess that
38:22 just happened some guy got a wheelbarrow
38:25 make some shimmer in there
38:28 mind blowing mind blowing we're now at a
38:31 point in science of course
38:32 which isn't exactly history but it's
38:34 what it is
38:36 where we can't get anything discovered
38:38 anymore
38:39 science has been utterly and completely
38:42 kicked in the balls
38:44 and pushed in a grave and there's a
38:47 you know a stonehenge stones dropped on
38:50 top of it
38:51 it ain't going anywhere people like neil
38:53 degrasse tyson
38:54 are heretics of human evolution
38:59 they're trying to make sure you don't
39:00 evolve anymore dragging around their 40
39:03 year old phds
39:05 having again never invented anything
39:07 interesting
39:08 because we would know at least arthur c
39:11 clarke
39:12 created the geocentric orbit theory
39:16 at least that's something that's
39:17 creative that's interesting
39:20 as an american what's very interesting
39:22 about this
39:25 and i'm trying to think about sort of
39:26 how a european would look at it
39:29 the story is clear about how america was
39:33 discovered right not necessarily
39:36 christopher columbus which is another
39:37 big
39:39 uh you know piece of propaganda there
39:43 because people were here before he was
39:44 here i mean we're pretty sure the
39:46 vikings got here first but whatever it
39:47 doesn't matter
39:49 this place was inhabited by millions of
39:51 native americans
39:53 true population may have been sparse
39:56 compared to what we're doing to it today
39:59 but of course all the massacres that the
40:01 native americans have been utterly
40:03 covered up by this ridiculous theory
40:05 that the conquistadors and us
40:08 mixed together gave them influenza
40:10 through pigs and blankets
40:12 it's just like okay we called them
40:14 indian givers when we were really the
40:16 indian givers
40:18 they loaned us things because we didn't
40:20 come over with anything that we needed
40:22 and eventually they said okay well we'd
40:24 like our stuff back especially if you're
40:25 going to go back
40:26 over to england and so it's very vivid
40:30 for everyone
40:31 in the entire planet that americans
40:33 slash europeans right
40:34 came over and wiped this place out over
40:37 the course of several
40:38 hundred years we also get blamed as
40:41 citizens
40:42 for slavery when again i'm willing to
40:46 bet over 50
40:47 of the americans that are here today
40:51 are from families that migrated after
40:53 1870
40:55 meaning no chance of ever owning a slave
40:59 and plus it's a very expensive thing to
41:00 do
41:02 very expensive thing dubai a slave the
41:05 prices were
41:06 50 bucks to 500 bucks to a thousand
41:09 bucks
41:10 in the late 1700s i mean like who's got
41:12 that kind of money besides a banker
41:15 who ended up building plantations in the
41:17 south and shipping all the goods back to
41:19 europe
41:20 but europe let's go back to native
41:22 americans to finish up
41:25 it's one of the coolest races on planet
41:27 earth in my opinion just
41:28 just so it's like an onion man they just
41:30 have so much to their culture and
41:32 and they started protecting themselves
41:35 and stopped telling the white man
41:37 the truth about their culture just
41:39 siphoning money at him is
41:40 really kind of funny as hell but we did
41:44 that
41:44 and it was in a modern age where it got
41:46 recorded that we did them
41:48 there are photographs of tribe leaders
41:50 and there's quotes from them and they
41:51 were interviewed and
41:54 so it's a very vivid thing and we're
41:56 guilty
41:58 feel beneath the white skin there is a
42:00 red skin suffering
42:01 you know what adamant said i feel
42:03 beneath the white there is a red skin
42:05 suffering something like that
42:06 but in europe this happened too
42:10 it's just predominantly white people
42:13 kill white people
42:15 over there totally decimated societies
42:19 and they would rebuild back
42:20 up and they'd do it again and again and
42:22 again
42:24 but apparently if you do it to someone
42:27 with pigment
42:29 that is very similar to your own
42:32 we don't even have a sense in our in our
42:34 mind and soul that that
42:36 is just like everything else that's ever
42:38 happened
42:39 there are historians that always say
42:40 well every race on earth has been a
42:42 slave race
42:43 every single race it's just what we say
42:46 is that
42:46 at some point we have evolved to a point
42:48 where we should know better
42:50 and that's the truth and so now we put
42:53 on
42:54 the noose the necktie and go out and do
42:56 it formally
42:58 my reason for mentioning those last two
43:00 is that sometimes we want to fix things
43:04 but they're really sort of things that
43:07 are
43:07 committed by people that aren't alive
43:10 anymore
43:11 you're you know it doesn't matter if
43:14 you're a descendant
43:15 of either the suffering side or the
43:18 prosecution side as long as you're not
43:20 doing anything today
43:21 to continue repressing a culture or
43:23 society
43:24 now of course being quiet about it is
43:27 sometimes construed as just as bad
43:29 and i don't disagree with that either
43:31 but i don't hear about
43:34 people in europe going well you did this
43:36 to me i mean the arabs in
43:39 the palestinian region of the world
43:42 they're sort of in that problem
43:46 believe me there's not going to be any
43:47 reparations for them
43:50 but we all think we're good guys we all
43:52 think we're the good guys
43:54 you think you're the good guys we think
43:56 we're the good guys
43:59 sometimes we can ally and then we're the
44:00 good guys together
44:02 and we look at those other people and
44:04 those are the bad guys
44:06 it has been utterly
44:10 i don't know what you call it despicable
44:14 that in america one political party was
44:18 accusing the other one
44:19 of of uh interfering
44:22 with how the president made it into
44:24 office
44:25 because russia supposedly bought less
44:28 than ten thousand dollars worth of ads
44:30 from facebook
44:32 that's what the evidence finally turned
44:33 out to be
44:35 and that was worth wasting 150 million
44:38 dollars
44:40 and every million dollars pays for 10
44:43 college educations
44:44 so the political party that's telling
44:46 all of these gullible
44:49 oh we're going to totally pay for
44:51 everything everything's going to be free
44:52 everything will be great
44:53 they just threw away 1500 college
44:57 degrees
44:58 chasing bs the nothing burger right
45:02 now we've had the most epic epic
45:06 crime in plain sight
45:10 for the next presidential situation
45:15 and they're saying oh i don't was you
45:17 know i don't see nothing
45:18 do you see anything no i don't see
45:19 nothing really
45:21 really every day pray there's no god
45:25 that's all i got to say man and don't
45:28 ever talk to anyone who's crossed the
45:29 other side and come back
45:33 nuts and this is the live editing that's
45:36 going on
45:38 there have been several shootings in the
45:41 world
45:42 always resulting in gun control you know
45:45 what is it
45:46 uh australia lost all of its gun doing a
45:49 shooting i think
45:50 canada lost it's due to a shooting
45:52 they've been trying to do in america
45:53 forever
45:55 all those events are in my episode i
45:58 think it's like
45:59 four i don't know let's say it's elite
46:01 400s
46:04 which i expose google i do
46:07 i show you their internal files all
46:09 those massacres
46:11 are all in their prohibited lists to
46:13 search on
46:14 they went to the extent of spelling the
46:16 accused name in every way
46:18 possible she couldn't look up their
46:20 background who they were every single
46:22 one of them
46:22 and all those actors that show up all
46:24 their names are in there too
46:26 hmm yeah because it's all real
46:30 if you're starting to get my drift that
46:32 history is the matrix
46:36 and if you start to realize how much it
46:38 influences your very
46:39 perception of yourself then this should
46:44 sink in pretty deep and might change
46:46 your life a little bit on how you
46:49 how important it is to cut off all of
46:51 those arteries from your life and i mean
46:54 cut it off since november 3rd
46:58 i haven't gone but just a handful of
47:01 times to any major
47:03 news source i just information from
47:07 sources i trust
47:10 sources that consistently mimic reality
47:13 when they talk about what's going on
47:16 meaning they'll say something is
47:18 happening and that this next thing
47:19 should happen because this thing i'm
47:21 saying you know they're saying is
47:22 happening
47:22 and then it happens like one step one
47:24 step two step three and you're like okay
47:26 that person's so far is on track
47:28 of course we all know that the disinfo
47:32 will never stop until these people are
47:36 annihilated off the planet surface
47:40 those who finance it and those who
47:41 engage in it
47:43 i try to guess why man is so
47:47 quick to take bad history into
47:50 himself and it sort of
47:56 kind of divides naturally in my mind
47:58 into two piles that are probably the two
48:00 biggest piles of why information is so
48:03 willfully ingested
48:05 that is so hopefully inaccurate
48:08 or holy and accurate hopefully
48:12 always a new word first i think it
48:15 starts with a utopian society that is
48:18 simply having
48:19 questions about existence unknowns
48:24 and it typically is it has some
48:27 attributes
48:29 and the attributes are it's really going
48:32 to be hard to ever find the answer
48:35 ever and
48:38 that answer i mean that particular
48:40 attribute might link
48:42 to the other one which is well i'm
48:45 pretty sure man will eventually figure
48:46 this out
48:49 remember we're not in a war society just
48:51 yet but i'm going to be dead before it
48:53 happens
48:54 so while i'm alive and you know maybe
48:57 you envision it being
48:58 figured out one two three thousand years
49:01 from now
49:03 i mean how long will it take before man
49:05 can go up
49:07 as a consumer you buy a vehicle and it's
49:09 like go ahead
49:10 see if the world's flat see if it's
49:12 around go ahead but if you want to stop
49:13 by mars and eat dinner at the
49:15 big burger shack you can do it how many
49:18 how many centuries is it gonna take to
49:20 do that
49:22 i'm hoping just a few but it might be a
49:24 thousand
49:25 so in the meantime what are you and i
49:27 gonna do in order to define it
49:30 we're going to make [ __ ] up that's what
49:31 we're going to do
49:33 and whoever can make up the best story
49:35 is going to be the one that gets adopted
49:37 the most
49:39 but you're going to have two groups of
49:41 minds that are going to ingest
49:43 probably two species of the solution to
49:45 that one wing
49:47 you're going to have the scientists
49:50 could be faux scientists like neil
49:51 degrasse tyson
49:52 or it could be one of you who's just a
49:54 great researcher and you pay attention
49:56 to observable reality
49:58 and so you're going to go with a very
49:59 clinical definition you're definitely
50:01 going to be heliocentric earth
50:04 and you're going to try to watch science
50:06 fiction shows on tv
50:07 and then take star trek and put it in
50:09 your equation you just will
50:10 it's natural i'm not saying it's bad
50:13 it's just natural
50:14 but then you'll have a very spiritual
50:16 person who's a god-fearing person
50:18 and probably read the bible once or
50:20 twice or whatever book you worship
50:24 and it's all going to go back to the
50:25 credit of your god
50:28 and it's going to be very allegorical
50:31 very magical it's adam and eve it's
50:36 noah and moses and all these folks
50:40 and you won't let in the signs they
50:42 won't let your stuff in you won't let
50:43 their stuff in
50:45 all right second big avenue
50:49 in my opinion well that's going to be
50:52 one about uh
50:54 fear fear
50:57 drives bad history doesn't it
51:01 now let's just say that that day in 2001
51:06 wasn't the united states government
51:08 attacking itself
51:10 through the neocon agenda to then
51:13 rationalize starting wars across the
51:15 ocean
51:16 to secure all the gold to secure the
51:18 fiat currency that we have
51:20 which was pulled out of the opec deal as
51:23 a mandatory currency to buy oil
51:25 we were protecting ourselves the
51:27 government wasn't honest with us they
51:29 treated us like morons
51:31 and because they thought we were morons
51:34 they killed thousands of people so now
51:37 let's reset that day
51:40 and let's just suggest for one second
51:41 that it wasn't
51:44 what it really was let's say it was what
51:47 they said it was
51:50 a bunch of passports linked to saudi
51:53 people
51:54 and we never even talked to the saudis
51:56 after this happens we go immediately to
51:58 afghanistan we immediately go to iraq
52:00 we immediately settle the debt with the
52:01 bush family against saddam hussein
52:05 okay but now that event is occurring
52:08 then we are utterly traumatized
52:11 to a level that only the people 1941
52:15 understand so now you need to make sense
52:18 of this
52:20 chaos why
52:24 because you need life to go on unless
52:27 there's going to be a phone call to your
52:28 bank all your bills are still due
52:32 if you're a good parent and your school
52:35 didn't terrorize your child with the
52:36 event
52:37 then you managed to kind of you know
52:38 they're just little kids they don't
52:41 maybe they're sitting in the front room
52:43 you turn the tv off once you know what's
52:44 going on
52:46 and you just pretend like hey let's just
52:48 make bake cakes today an easy bake oven
52:51 and they're just cleansed from that they
52:52 don't have to go through that trauma
52:54 but you do and you have to find a way to
52:57 be happy and your spouse is coming home
52:59 later
53:01 two of you are going to be whispering in
53:02 the room okay what's going on well you
53:05 know we live in a major city as well
53:06 what's going to happen we live next to
53:07 the sears tower we live next to big
53:09 buildings in l.a
53:10 what's going to happen well someone's
53:13 going to make up something that makes
53:15 general sense and you're going to
53:16 swallow it because you're in a crisis
53:19 and you calm your brain down there's no
53:22 way that you're just going to go
53:23 oh life was okay and then now this is
53:25 where it turns into total chaotic crap
53:27 for the rest of my existence
53:29 you will never settle for that so as the
53:33 information starts pouring in we split
53:36 this one
53:37 in half you have people that will
53:39 believe
53:40 anything to calm them down anything
53:45 and then you have red pillars that just
53:48 go
53:49 what really planes
53:52 sea level flying at 450 or 500 miles an
53:56 hour
53:57 i heard the wings rip off when that
53:59 occurs
54:01 what there's no part parts of the plane
54:04 tail on the side of the one that hit the
54:05 second tower
54:07 hm what what did they pull out of the
54:10 pentagon they carried an
54:11 engine on their on a on a gurney
54:14 with a blue cloth over it with some guys
54:16 like their pallbearers at a funeral
54:19 but one engine weighs 28 000
54:22 pounds i don't care what shape you make
54:25 it
54:26 and ain't gonna be picked up by a bunch
54:27 of dudes who was trying to carry the fat
54:29 uncle
54:29 to the hole in the ground you know what
54:32 if you just took physics in high school
54:34 you completed the first nine months of
54:37 physics in high school
54:38 and you just do a little physics on this
54:40 thing you're like man that doesn't make
54:41 any sense
54:43 you get my point so because of your
54:46 intelligence
54:49 on this particular wing you may not
54:51 accept
54:52 any story that comes by on the other
54:55 side it would be
54:56 merely you you're devoid
54:59 of religion
55:03 you have never found any value in it and
55:06 so
55:06 you go off into the scientific realm
55:08 trying to kill god
55:10 and then you're gonna run into a bunch
55:11 of voids quite literally
55:15 so what do we do moving forward
55:18 what do we do well
55:22 i think that the easy easy
55:25 easy solution which will calm your soul
55:28 tremendously
55:30 is the d-platform bad
55:34 sources of history meaning don't ever go
55:37 to their sites
55:38 never let the domains be viewed
55:42 by you you know if you're really clever
55:45 you can go into your router and block a
55:46 bunch of domains be kind of funny
55:49 cnn.com fox news but you just detox
55:53 yourself
55:54 out of this i have been taught how to
55:57 ingest
55:57 bad history without even thinking about
56:00 it
56:02 and then what happens is you either
56:06 take a break for one but two
56:11 you'll find out you don't need to know
56:12 everything about the world you just
56:14 don't
56:15 if paris is having riots whatever
56:18 no you're it's not your thing what are
56:20 you gonna do i mean if you're parisian
56:22 sure if you go over there and get
56:25 involved but your family will tell you
56:27 that your friends will tell you that not
56:28 the news
56:30 when you're saying well i heard you know
56:32 a bunch of bunch of violence happened
56:33 today and your buddies are all like
56:35 no i walk the whole route that we do in
56:38 fact i was last in line i walked the
56:40 whole route that we walked that
56:41 particular day just like a marathon
56:44 no cops no nothing all right
56:49 third off third step is to find yourself
56:51 some sources that you trust
56:53 and it'll take you a little while you
56:54 gotta test them out
56:58 of the easiest ways to test out a source
57:01 is to ask that source about history that
57:03 you believe you totally understand
57:05 either through again family members that
57:07 may have lived during eras
57:10 where they know the truth and you trust
57:13 them
57:13 they're awake people in general
57:17 and so you uh you switch over when you
57:20 want to ingest some stuff
57:22 make sure it's pure cut news
57:26 but if you do that second step first
57:28 where you realize
57:30 other people's problems are other
57:31 people's problems when it's
57:33 8 000 miles away now of course if
57:35 something
57:36 horrific is occurring like some other
57:39 holocaust or some other genocide
57:42 maybe maybe you can do something
57:46 if a genocide happens again in africa
57:48 because one mining company
57:50 gives one warlord a ton of money and
57:53 guns and
57:53 and stuff to go nail the ones that are
57:55 still carrying around wooden shields
57:57 and wearing masks there's nothing you
58:00 can do
58:02 i mean there really isn't anything you
58:04 can do but you do out finance the mining
58:06 company you're gonna write your
58:08 congressman a letter
58:09 are you kidding me if you can ever clear
58:11 the swamp out
58:12 i will reintroduce that last suggestion
58:15 then again you probably won't have to do
58:17 that because
58:18 they will have an intel briefing every
58:20 morning and they'll take action
58:22 themselves can't have bullies in the
58:24 world you know
58:26 history has become very interesting now
58:28 that the mormons have really put
58:30 together the gene
58:31 genealogy database right ancestry.com
58:36 it's amazing like i've said a few times
58:39 they
58:39 email me photographs of my relatives
58:42 about once a year that i have never seen
58:47 and that's crazy because we have a lot
58:48 of photographs already
58:50 i got some goofy looking relatives let
58:52 me tell you now in terms of d
58:54 platforming big tech think about it
59:00 you've got uh well you want to start a
59:03 business
59:05 i'm sure this is true overseas but in
59:07 america you want to start a business
59:09 you got to be on at least instagram
59:14 and some some companies really need
59:17 facebook as well
59:19 i don't think anyone needs twitter
59:20 unless you're a personality
59:22 that's pushing your wares which is fine
59:24 like joe rogan has to have twitter he
59:26 just does
59:27 so they've got us dependent on their
59:29 platforms
59:31 you ever notice uh i just
59:34 had to create a instagram for a new
59:36 company i'm putting together
59:39 and so i was like oh you know i do
59:40 instagram on my desktop computer
59:42 for a very strategic reason they can't
59:44 raid my computer
59:46 for all of their privacy policy crap or
59:48 all their terms and services where
59:50 they're like we're gonna sell everything
59:51 you've ever done
59:52 on your phone to the rest of the world
59:54 once you run through your computer
59:57 you cut them off so if you're on a
59:59 macintosh what you do is you run
60:01 bluestacks
60:02 bluestacks is android on your macintosh
60:06 and then you just run instagram within
60:08 bluestacks which is its own quarantined
60:10 area
60:13 you never install any tech software you
60:16 can get air droid for that if you have
60:18 an android
60:20 macintosh they're selling your soul to
60:22 the devil
60:23 you're really screwed you just are
60:27 just as an operating system itself you
60:29 know
60:31 but you go up and try to uh
60:34 i was trying to post from my desktop i
60:37 was trying to
60:38 put tags in an image on my desktop
60:42 i can't do it they don't let their
60:44 website do it
60:45 but why wouldn't you do that because
60:48 they want your phone
60:50 your phone is your rfid chip your phone
60:53 has your whole life on it
60:54 and now they're trying to raid your
60:56 phone
60:58 so you have to go tonight tonight to
60:59 nine to nine tonight you can't touch any
61:00 of my contacts you can't touch any of my
61:03 cameras or my microphones deny don't ask
61:05 again and deny don't ask again and i
61:07 just keep doing that until you cut them
61:08 completely off
61:10 if you're curious what your settings are
61:12 now just go into your settings and
61:14 cut them all off this still probably get
61:17 around it
61:19 now if someone's after you like some
61:21 intelligence agency there's nothing you
61:22 can do it's all in their system
61:24 but they're trying to sell your stuff
61:26 because mark zuckerberg hasn't learned
61:27 his lesson yet
61:29 our twitter account got turned back on
61:31 by the way funny how it just magically
61:33 turned on after the
61:35 november 3rd i mean it was off for a
61:38 couple months
61:38 but uh you know they turned off all
61:41 their verification i was able to update
61:42 the phone number which was the big
61:44 problem
61:46 so i might start posting it on twitter
61:48 who knows
61:50 but detoxing yourself and re-engineering
61:52 your entire
61:54 matrix and taking control of your matrix
61:57 is my
61:57 my big piece of advice to you and you
62:00 know christmas day there was an rv that
62:02 had a
62:04 disturbing mechanical problem
62:07 and of course they knew exactly who the
62:09 guy was right away
62:12 and it might have been him who knows a
62:14 bunch of suspect crap going on there of
62:16 course
62:18 again they couldn't find out who you
62:19 know it's just so funny when you're
62:21 around cars and you're in garages
62:24 uh they've been looping
62:27 ropes for i don't know how many hundreds
62:30 of years
62:31 even garages in blacksmith
62:34 uh liveries have had these ropes tied
62:37 like that because you know what it's
62:39 kind of hard to pull on a straight rope
62:41 they like to have the
62:42 the leverage of a loop but then nascar
62:45 douchebag walked in and said oh it's all
62:47 racist someone put a noose on my garage
62:50 that dude knew what he was doing it was
62:51 a complete stunt that guy has seen those
62:53 nooses on garage doors his whole life
62:58 but he pulled a jessie smoothie
63:01 the fbi couldn't figure out whether or
63:02 not that was a
63:04 a racist thing for what almost 30 days
63:06 but this
63:07 christmas thing in nashville
63:10 instantaneously knew
63:11 within like what 48 hours or something
63:13 they knew exactly who did it
63:15 and they don't know motive yet now the
63:17 only credible thing about it
63:19 was that his neighbor this woman said
63:21 that he had
63:23 told her and i saw an interview with her
63:26 she didn't seem like a conniving person
63:29 seemed like a sweet
63:30 lady but she said that he had walked up
63:32 to her and said something about
63:34 you know nashville is going to remember
63:36 me or something like that
63:38 if you go back and watch the video of
63:39 the explosion
63:41 something's very suspect because the
63:42 rv's across the street from the att
63:44 building
63:45 and when the rv completes blowing up
63:48 which it did
63:49 there's a big epicenter of the explosion
63:52 across the street with sparks and fire
63:54 and a cloud over there
63:56 so just being in a family that
64:01 had explosive experts people who built
64:04 bombs
64:05 because they were chemistry experts and
64:08 just doing little stupid things in the
64:09 midwest
64:10 i've never seen the uh you know someone
64:13 have a bomb
64:14 and then you blow it up in the center of
64:16 the
64:18 playground cement and then when it's
64:21 done
64:22 the epicenter's you know somewhere else
64:25 i've just never seen that happen
64:27 but maybe there's some acoustical
64:29 problem where the
64:31 some of the propellant flew across the
64:32 street and ended up blowing up last
64:34 across the street could be
64:36 could be we never built uh fertilizer
64:39 stuff but i think you feel me man i
64:42 think
64:44 it's what i want to get you to kind of
64:45 think about after this episode is
64:47 history is not just this thing
64:50 it is your programming it is your
64:52 programming
64:53 layer one programming almost your binary
64:56 code
64:58 of who you think you are of where you
65:00 think you are
65:03 what time you think you are i sort of
65:05 had a romantic thought during the
65:06 episode which is
65:08 some sort of sci-fi script where
65:12 there is time travel
65:15 it is a business from the future
65:19 and they treat history in the film
65:23 as if it is the matrix
65:27 because it is but if you knew this and
65:29 you had the power to travel in time
65:31 which i don't think is possible unless
65:34 we're in a matrix
65:36 then think about the havoc
65:39 that you could wreak on the world
65:43 and how you could get entire societies
65:45 to do whatever the hell you wanted
65:47 and then we're just in the video game
65:49 and i want to give you a random
65:50 statement at the end maybe this is my
65:52 steve jobs thing
65:54 this is totally random nothing to do
65:55 with this episode but it has to do with
65:57 the npc
65:59 theory because when i said we are in the
66:01 matrix as
66:02 like almost tourists perhaps just to
66:04 have a little fun like total recall
66:07 this might apply i watch these videos of
66:10 uh
66:11 car crash compilations just to kind of
66:14 unwind my mind and
66:16 and definitely calm down a lot when i'm
66:17 driving well if you think you have if
66:19 you have road rage problems
66:20 just watch these videos seriously if you
66:23 just would have a secret
66:25 road rage you've never done anything you
66:27 never hurt anybody but
66:28 you feel like ah it's just getting worse
66:30 every day and you feel like one day
66:31 you're going to jump out of the car and
66:32 you're going to really regret it
66:34 watch those videos but anyway what blows
66:37 my mind
66:38 with these videos and if you have never
66:39 watched one
66:41 this will be a great little chotsky to
66:43 have in your mind when you do
66:46 people have these dash cams right and
66:48 they're awesome but they're expensive
66:50 and
66:50 cumbersome to install into your car
66:53 especially my car
66:54 i looked it up and they will see
66:57 and these these crash videos don't
66:58 typically have any fatalities or
67:00 anything in fact
67:01 99 of them are are no injuries at all
67:05 but they'll witness out the windshield
67:08 pretty like until you know it looks like
67:11 people died sometimes but they're
67:12 totally fine
67:15 and you can hear the car you can hear
67:16 the radio you can hear you know
67:18 all the little jingles of keys and you
67:20 know when those steering wheel turns you
67:21 hear that little crackle in the leather
67:23 and stuff so it's a really good
67:24 microphone
67:25 good video and people would just be
67:27 looking at the car
67:28 one was the car that no one got injured
67:30 in well yeah i don't think anyone got
67:32 seriously injured but it was um
67:35 they did do a medevac but it was no
67:36 life-threatening injuries but a car
67:40 was just crossing into green light and a
67:42 diesel
67:43 with an 80 000 pound load was going
67:47 probably 60 plus and the car got
67:51 just went right underneath the last
67:52 tires
67:54 of the trailer and you just see this car
67:56 disappear
67:57 and you just thought for sure everyone's
67:59 dead and they weren't so that's good
68:02 but the dude watched this and i believe
68:06 i didn't hear the driver say anything
68:08 but there's hundreds and hundreds of
68:10 videos russians
68:11 they say stuff it's pretty funny sukkah
68:15 but there'll be all these accidents and
68:16 all these people are just like what are
68:18 they
68:18 brain dead they're looking at one in a
68:21 million moments in people's lives not
68:23 everyone gets in a major accident ever
68:25 in their lifetime
68:26 but they see one and like i
68:29 probably 8 out of 10 they don't say
68:33 anything
68:34 when they're witnessing someone else get
68:35 hurt and
68:37 the other one is uh you'll see videos
68:40 every once in a while of like a head-on
68:41 collision again non-fatal
68:45 and it's like in residential or
68:47 something right
68:48 and the whole impact occurs and
68:51 they're getting out of their car but
68:53 they're in the car for you know
68:55 five ten seconds kind of going wow that
68:57 was interesting and then they get out of
68:58 the car and
68:59 not even say in a word it just seems
69:02 strange
69:03 the loudest talkers are the ones that
69:04 are not getting hit at all they're just
69:06 pissed off someone's cutting them off or
69:07 there's a little fender bender in there
69:09 they're the ones yelling and screaming
69:11 it's just it just
69:13 makes me think like are there only a few
69:16 of us who are real players in this mmo
69:18 and everybody else's npcs
69:21 it really starts to feel like that just
69:24 this deer in the eye mouth open
69:26 thing i guess i don't know man it's
69:28 really strange
