00:34 all right ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:36 back to deep thoughts today we are going
00:40 to discuss violence and culture because
00:46 it's a subject that's been brought up a
00:48 lot if you're in your 40s you've heard
00:51 the whole gamut of this whole thing and
00:55 people so I got a request to do an
00:59 episode on violence and video games and
01:01 I thought well that's a great idea
01:03 but it's not just in videogames nowadays
01:06 it's in music it's in television it's in
01:10 film and it's also all over the internet
01:14 in the form of you know videos of
01:16 horrific things that happen in the world
01:18 I mean there's just an unceasing amount
01:21 of violence that's being portrayed on us
01:26 but I want to slow down time go into it
01:30 and now and analyze excuse me what we
01:34 think about such a thing
01:36 because depending on how old you are and
01:40 depending on your experience in life you
01:43 could end up defending it you could be a
01:47 person that defended it at one point in
01:48 time and now that you've grown up a
01:50 little bit you realize how much it's
01:52 really screwed up society and you know
01:55 being in video games myself since geez
01:57 the earth well like you know I played
01:59 video games in the arcades in the late
02:01 70s went through the 80s and learned how
02:07 to make them draw them and program them
02:09 and design them and in the 90s got a
02:13 chance to work
02:14 for you know video game companies like
02:16 Activision and Electronic Arts and in my
02:19 own company
02:21 and of course when you work for a one
02:23 company you're you're analyzing every
02:26 other company right you're looking at
02:28 what the competition's doing where is it
02:29 going if you're a good game designer
02:31 you're looking for cliches you looking
02:33 for cliches in every single conceivable
02:36 metric of human behavior you're looking
02:40 at it from what are the mechanics in a
02:42 video game over first person or third
02:44 person is it a side view scholars that
02:45 top-down isometric you know it's all
02:48 these different things but then it gets
02:51 into color palettes then in the 90s when
02:54 we got more horsepower and more disk
02:56 space to ship a game on we really
02:59 started getting into a deep story and it
03:04 doesn't actually take a deep story at
03:06 all to get to this huge transformation
03:08 in society and of course the 21st
03:12 century it's just it's just on steroids
03:17 music music as we always say you know
03:20 there was no violence in music in the
03:23 60s and 70s and most of the 80s of
03:25 course towards the 80s you start getting
03:27 into some of the gangster rap stuff and
03:29 we'll talk about that the 90s that went
03:33 off the chain you know we have utter
03:35 gangster rap making you know suburban
03:38 kids look like gangsters while video
03:41 games like you know Grand Theft Auto
03:43 were coming out and basically teaching
03:46 kids how to conceive of killing
03:49 murdering maiming every single class
03:52 structure there you know from you know a
03:56 homeless guy that needs a hand out to
03:58 you know someone walking down a woman
04:00 walking down the street in a business
04:02 suit television shows have polarize good
04:06 and bad in the opposite realms such as
04:09 shows like Breaking Bad which was a
04:11 brilliantly made show brilliantly
04:13 written however if you pay attention
04:15 you're rooting for the bad guys anytime
04:19 they kill and murder someone it's
04:22 usually another bad guy but you know
04:24 that at the end of that show there's a
04:27 officer that ends up cracking the case
04:29 and he's a bad guy you know to us you
04:32 know because you want the the the good
04:35 guys to lose the bad guys to win because
04:36 that's how the story is formatted we
04:40 have accepted this sort of Odyssey of
04:44 you know the Coliseum where people used
04:48 to go inside of a building and watch
04:51 supposedly you know Christians and other
04:54 people be torn to shreds by animals
04:57 lions and that kind of stuff or two
04:59 humans going at it we're a gladiators
05:01 gonna fight a peasant where there's you
05:04 know it's the whole cards are stacked
05:06 all against this guy and because it
05:09 wasn't us being hurt we as a people back
05:13 in the Roman days would sit there and
05:14 watch that stuff and go woof
05:16 Lisa it's not me boy am i I feel better
05:18 about my life when I go home on
05:21 television we have not only fictional
05:23 gore but we have reality show gore you
05:26 know we have light reality gore which is
05:29 be like a show like cops all the way to
05:32 [Music]
05:33 shows like lockup where you're watching
05:36 a bunch of people in prison and again
05:39 you're thinking your lucky stars you're
05:40 not the person in prison but boy you
05:44 want to watch their suffering on
05:45 television right and we're all guilty
05:47 this I'm not saying that I didn't you
05:51 know watch this with total fascination
05:53 because again one thing to remember is
05:56 that the mind is sort of a pattern
05:58 buffer
05:59 it's a pattern machine and we get tired
06:02 of old patterns once we learn the cycle
06:06 of being introduced to new patterns and
06:08 it's alien at first it's interesting
06:10 there's a lot of curiosity involved so
06:13 we go and explore it we exhaust the
06:15 entire trend of say a decade's worth of
06:18 new video games new music new television
06:21 new film all that stuff and then we want
06:23 to change we want it to go to another
06:25 level and the simple game is to keep
06:29 ratcheting up the same formula you know
06:31 what was a Dirty Harry movie in late 70s
06:34 early 80s type thing turns into more
06:38 gangster films until Tarantino gets on
06:40 their rights
06:41 brilliant films that were just god-awful
06:43 horrific scenes brilliantly written
06:46 brilliantly shot brilliantly acted but
06:49 still it keeps rashing it up and
06:51 ratcheting it up and you know the
06:54 technicality of the people who make this
06:56 stuff is that they are becoming wealthy
06:58 as a result of creating this content so
07:00 they never have to live in these
07:01 situations typically they're never held
07:03 at gunpoint they don't worry about
07:05 necessarily the safety of their homes
07:07 when they go home now of course there
07:09 are stalkers that can mess it up for
07:10 everybody but overall the effect of what
07:14 they're doing doesn't bother them
07:15 because they're not in that realm
07:19 it's like there's a class structure you
07:21 have the upper upper class folks that
07:23 pay for this kind of stuff and I don't
07:24 mean that quite literally as in whoever
07:26 has a lot of money does this I'm just
07:28 saying when you make a ton of money off
07:30 making a video game that's really
07:31 violent you get to move to the the gated
07:34 communities and just enjoy the best part
07:39 about life you know according to culture
07:42 right but with the turn of 9/11 we have
07:48 in the formation of Isis the formation
07:51 of al Qaeda before them all these you
07:53 know Wars that freak us out and make us
07:56 push a lot of money into military
07:58 industrial complexes so we can be
08:00 protected you know the fact that
08:03 beheading videos are ever filmed whether
08:05 they be real or not it doesn't really
08:07 matter because the effect on society is
08:09 exactly the same and now we know there's
08:13 a constant stream of videos out of every
08:15 area of the world that is engaging in
08:17 you know sort of guerilla warfare
08:19 whether it be a drug cartel or a real
08:22 war that is between you know
08:24 nation-states and religious ideologies
08:26 and all that stuff and so you know it's
08:32 good to talk about it because I want to
08:34 make sure that any of you who are
08:35 slightly younger can understand someone
08:38 in my position and what I've seen so you
08:40 can understand there actually was a
08:41 transformation into this realm if you
08:44 were in your 20s right now you've known
08:46 nothing else but absolute horror you
08:48 would you're born in the late 90s and
08:51 you know before you were really
08:54 having and retrieving memories 9/11 had
08:56 already occurred by the time you're out
08:58 of grade school where we've already
08:59 completed a couple huge wars in the
09:02 Middle East about time you got into
09:05 junior high in high school
09:06 beheading videos everywhere I want you
09:10 to understand that this wasn't the way
09:11 it was and without a television without
09:15 an internet without video games music
09:18 and all forms of media you wouldn't have
09:22 known a lot of these things occurred
09:24 because they never happened in your
09:25 neighborhood they never happened in your
09:26 circle right how many of you seen
09:29 something absolutely horrific on a media
09:33 device your telephone and a computer
09:36 whatever movie theater a video game
09:38 console but in your real life you've
09:41 never seen anything like that remotely
09:42 in fact you don't even know anyone who's
09:44 ever seen anything like that unless
09:46 maybe you talk to a soldier or a police
09:47 officer I think that's the majority of
09:51 the world I think that's 99.9 percent of
09:54 the world and the problem with it is
09:59 that we incorporate fictional situations
10:03 and even real situations into our room
10:06 so let's go back to what I can offer you
10:11 which is my upbringing and and I've
10:16 loosely talked about this kind of stuff
10:18 throughout a lot of different episodes
10:19 telling you what was a big deal when I
10:21 was a kid and what wasn't a big deal
10:22 when I was a kid
10:23 and I think it's very healthy for you
10:26 guys to hear it if you're older like me
10:28 or older than me you're gonna nod your
10:30 head and you're gonna be able to
10:32 contribute other decade insights such as
10:34 the 60s and the 50s and perhaps the 40s
10:36 and you're gonna know that none of this
10:38 stuff occurred even though we had
10:40 horrific Wars and soldiers went off to
10:42 you know world war one world war two
10:44 Korea Vietnam and countless other wars
10:47 in the world depending on where you're
10:49 from you know our soldiers saw this kind
10:51 of stuff there's actually some very
10:54 interesting statistics that have been
10:55 released about war that the amount of
11:00 casualties inflicted were not as much as
11:03 it could have been because of the moral
11:05 ethics in both sides of the war
11:08 so take a world war one you had a lot of
11:10 Nazis that weren't willing to just
11:12 willy-nilly kill everyone and a bunch of
11:14 British and well basically the Allied
11:16 forces as we call ourselves right we
11:19 didn't always shoot to kill we shot to
11:21 warn and we shot to kind of persuade
11:23 them to retreat to hopefully think it
11:26 through and cease this entire war now in
11:28 the end we obviously had to get really
11:30 brutal with everything but a lot ease
11:32 was never really in with the conclusion
11:34 they just sort of pull out and that's it
11:36 so when I grew up in the 70s all right I
11:40 mean I was born at 69
11:41 all the way up till 1980 you know the
11:45 the sentiment of what was the the
11:51 average violence that you saw on
11:53 television was minimal you know there's
11:56 a lot of you including myself that have
11:57 watched old movies from the 30s 40s and
11:59 50s and when someone got shot there was
12:02 barely any blood someone just grabbed
12:04 their chest and fell down and that was
12:06 enough for society and by the way back
12:09 in those days unless you were a soldier
12:11 you were totally and utterly satisfied
12:13 Society was satisfied with that
12:15 fictional reenactment of death and
12:18 what's funny is there's some Bollywood
12:20 movies out there that we have these you
12:22 know the famous death scenes where a guy
12:24 gets shot like 15 times in a room and he
12:27 just keeps they keep editing this death
12:29 scene for like gosh
12:30 seems like three minutes you know and
12:32 yes there was a little bit of blood
12:33 added to that later on but we were a
12:36 very innocent society and we were still
12:39 able to fight for what was right
12:40 we still dropped bombs on people and
12:43 hurt people not that that's a good thing
12:45 but it shows an interesting duality
12:47 between what society was exposed to and
12:50 what our soldiers were exposed to and
12:52 it's probably still there's still
12:55 obviously a drastic difference between
12:56 what an actual soldier sees and what
12:58 society sees but honestly when a soldier
13:00 came home from say Vietnam and someone
13:03 talked about a horrific torture that
13:05 happened to one of their fellow fellow
13:07 soldiers people were horrified and
13:10 soldiers again like I've said many times
13:12 on the show they didn't come home and
13:13 share it with their wives and their kids
13:15 because it was too horrific to talk
13:16 about they know that the words they had
13:19 to speak at the kitchen table or out
13:21 back on the porch
13:22 during a fishing expedition were so
13:25 horrific that they didn't want to
13:26 traumatize everyone in earshot but today
13:30 I I would wager that there's very little
13:33 that a soldier could bring home in terms
13:35 of a real life experience that would
13:37 mildly interest a teenager because they
13:40 they see it all the time on the Internet
13:42 if you want to see it and it's one of
13:46 these things that as I as I move forward
13:48 here let's remember that once you see
13:50 something that is horrific you can't
13:53 unsee it in a way even if you tend to
13:56 forget the visuals the the overall arc
14:00 and horror that goes into your chest and
14:02 circles inside your brain and then adds
14:04 to other formulas of how to resolve
14:07 conflicts doesn't go away and so you
14:12 know I think that in the 60s and 70s
14:15 that I was more familiar with by either
14:18 growing up and listening to people who
14:19 had grown up through those other decades
14:21 or the one that I was experiencing if
14:23 you had a conflict you didn't always
14:25 have someone going and getting a gun or
14:27 even envisioning a capital punishment
14:30 situation I'm gonna shoot that guy I'm
14:32 gonna kill that guy those kind of things
14:33 weren't spoken very often but let me
14:36 give you two examples one's kind of
14:38 silly and one is more on point there was
14:42 a show on TV called good times back in
14:45 the day and it's a family that lives in
14:48 sort of the projects in New York and one
14:51 of the famous characters in that show is
14:53 JJ and he's just a fun-loving guy the
14:56 whole family is actually very fun-loving
14:57 but he's just off the charts positive
15:01 kind of guy always looks towards you
15:03 know the good in people and there was a
15:06 zone where he was being cornered by a
15:08 gang in in his neighborhood in New York
15:10 and they wanted him to join the gang and
15:14 he was kind of kind of looking for a
15:16 rite of passage so he kind of agrees to
15:18 it because he figures you know what are
15:19 we gonna do we're gonna wear our colors
15:21 we're gonna walk around protect our
15:23 street what's the deal maybe we're
15:25 getting a little skirmish here in there
15:26 but no big deal
15:27 well the leader wanted him to prove
15:30 himself to the gang using a gun
15:34 and some little you know revolver
15:36 peashooter gun some little 38 or
15:39 something and the episode is was
15:43 shocking to all of us in the 70s and of
15:45 course I was a little kid but the idea
15:47 that a gun was being introduced into the
15:49 show was a huge deal and the whole moral
15:51 the story was that you don't want to do
15:53 that this is not the way to solve
15:54 problems and it was kind of a shocker
15:58 for late-night sitcom realism now Ron I
16:04 think 1979 another movie a movie came
16:07 out called warriors a lot of you've seen
16:10 us they made a video game after it at
16:12 rockstar I happen to see this film when
16:15 I was really young when it was in the
16:17 theaters and what's interesting about
16:20 this movie is the movie is about a gang
16:23 from Coney Island that is called to a
16:26 central meeting in the Bronx and there's
16:29 a big gang called the in the riffs and
16:34 the riffs want to bring all the gangs
16:36 together and all the kind of affiliates
16:38 of the gangs and take over New York
16:40 completely fight all the cops off I
16:42 guess kill them or whatever at least
16:43 fight them off take over the city and
16:45 they'll rule the whole place and then I
16:47 guess it's like expansion from that
16:49 point for it right and this guy so that
16:52 so the Coney Island gang goes to this
16:54 central meeting in Bronx and the way
16:57 that that goes down is they said they
16:59 want nine delegates from every single
17:00 gang to go they don't want the whole
17:02 gang and they don't want anyone packing
17:03 me no weapons right and so they go to
17:08 this meeting and this guy Cyrus comes up
17:11 and gives one of the most legendary
17:12 speeches ever filmed about how to bring
17:15 this together and this punk ass gang
17:18 whose name always escapes me even though
17:20 I've seen this movie probably 200 times
17:22 brings a gun again like some 357 or
17:26 something and he manages to shoot Cyrus
17:28 right after he finishes his speech he's
17:30 up on this kind of wood structure and
17:34 kills him and the whole place freaks out
17:37 I mean you know I don't even know is
17:40 like probably 10,000 people at this
17:41 rally or something like that and
17:44 everyone's freaking out the cops show up
17:46 turned their lights on which
17:48 probably why most people running around
17:49 but this gang who shot Cyrus then points
17:53 at randomly the leader of the Warriors
17:56 and says there he is he did it the
17:58 Warriors did it and so the the rumor
18:01 goes around that the Warriors killed
18:03 Cyrus and so the the gang one of the guy
18:06 get basically gets beat up the gang
18:09 starts their trek back home on foot and
18:12 now every single gang in New York has
18:14 commanded by the riffs using a deejay is
18:17 instructed to to capture the Warriors to
18:22 pay for what they did and of course at
18:24 the same time this other game that
18:26 really did it's kind of meandering
18:27 around causing trouble but it was a huge
18:31 deal that this gun was brought there and
18:33 that he was shot it's not that people
18:35 didn't die in New York come on it
18:37 happens and you know New York used to be
18:39 very violent in the 70s and the early
18:41 eighties but here's the thing you might
18:43 think well no one had guns at that
18:45 meeting because and this is a fictional
18:46 story but this is written based on sort
18:48 of what society would accept as a
18:51 legendary gangster movie you know like a
18:53 real not not mobster gangster but just
18:56 sort of gangs in New York right but when
19:00 they are told to capture the Warriors
19:04 now you have every single gang could do
19:06 whatever they want they can get all
19:07 strapped again they can do whatever they
19:08 want bring their weapons and every
19:10 single gang that they brought bumped
19:12 into did not have a gun you know the
19:15 baseball Furies with bats you had was a
19:18 turbo Lacy's they had bats and chains
19:20 and stuff it's not that you couldn't get
19:22 killed by getting hit in the head with a
19:23 bat or something but it was much more
19:26 subdued and of course at the end of the
19:29 into the movie they they managed to
19:32 clear their name and that sort of thing
19:33 and there's a pretty interesting finale
19:35 that goes on there but up to 1980 that
19:37 was sort of the full arc of what was
19:41 going on in America in terms of people's
19:45 commercial perception of violence within
19:47 this country with the 80s you had you
19:51 know a huge explosion of all kinds of
19:54 things you know the music culture sort
19:56 of the glam rock blew up you had the
19:58 British pop thing that was going on punk
20:01 was kind of dying
20:02 this go was kind of dying off but it
20:04 sort of made its way in a lot of music
20:05 to be honest films films were like every
20:09 which way but loose you know with Clint
20:11 Eastwood doing fights behind you know
20:14 stores to make money and that kind of
20:16 stuff towards the mid eighties we
20:20 started seeing a little bit of violence
20:22 start coming in that was sort of off the
20:24 chain which was like the movies like
20:26 terminator you know we said we had
20:28 movies like well just basically all the
20:31 movies like die hard and and all the big
20:34 superhero films that were going on right
20:36 I don't owe me super arrow but you know
20:37 basically Schwarzenegger Bruce Willis
20:40 Sylvester Stallone that gang or making a
20:42 lot of films you know a Total Recall
20:46 came out I went to the movie theater I
20:47 think I've told this story and I was in
20:49 Thousand Oaks California at the mall
20:52 watching the movie and the crowd was
20:54 actually very energized very excited and
20:56 every time I was fortunate well sorry
20:58 any time anyone got killed in the movie
20:59 most of which were Arnold they started
21:02 counting and counting by the time the
21:04 movie was only like maybe 10 minutes in
21:06 and we were up to the 40's and we
21:08 stopped counting because you just
21:09 couldn't pronounce it right and everyone
21:10 started laughing and we ended up
21:11 watching the film the director of that
21:14 film was very famous for saying more
21:16 blood more blood right in the music
21:20 industry we also had rap and rap had a
21:22 very interesting transformation that if
21:24 you were there it was sort of wild how
21:28 it would spawn the early rap of the
21:31 world was just all about dancing
21:33 partying and just the overall fun
21:36 culture that America was in a lot of the
21:40 lyrics were about you know don't do
21:42 cocaine you know white lines with
21:43 Grandmaster Flash and you had you know
21:48 Run DMC and LL Cool J and kool Moe Dee
21:50 and Kurtis Blow and all these guys
21:52 trying to clean up society and saying
21:54 look we do you stop this we need to get
21:56 the ghetto out of the ghetto and it was
21:59 great then the first first three groups
22:04 I ever saw that really got kind of hard
22:06 one it was actually a fairly innocent
22:08 guy that just happened to have a tougher
22:11 delivery you had Eric be in Rocky and
22:15 Keem was famous for this really tough
22:18 monotone style delivering lyrics still a
22:21 peaceful guy still really sort of a
22:24 philosopher and he still makes records
22:26 to this day of highly recommend you look
22:27 up his catalogue
22:28 you also had ice-t coming on the set and
22:32 ice-t had seen a lot of stuff and New
22:34 York and Los Angeles obviously made some
22:36 money rapping for the movie breakin in
22:38 breakin - then he comes out with Bryan
22:43 pays and he starts kind of laying it out
22:47 about what it's like to be in Los
22:48 Angeles with 6:00 in the morning that
22:50 kind of stuff then of course we had the
22:52 debut of NWA where you have guys
22:56 straight inside the center consciousness
23:00 of Los Angeles which is Compton and they
23:03 started revealing the the police
23:05 brutality in the world that they live in
23:07 and it started rejecting this automatic
23:11 obeying of police officers what was
23:14 interesting about it was that I think in
23:16 most communities in the United States
23:17 police officers were good guys 100% you
23:21 know you're talking about again a
23:22 fraction of a single percent of cops and
23:25 the ghettos were disillusioned with
23:27 trying to figure out how to control the
23:29 chaos in these areas right and of course
23:32 drugs were dropped in so you had cocaine
23:35 from the club 54 was too expensive for
23:38 the ghettos to buy so someone
23:39 brilliantly creates crack cocaine and
23:41 uses both the Crips and the Bloods to
23:44 distribute it all over the ghettos which
23:46 obviously oppressed the ghettos and so
23:50 there was a lot of violence and
23:52 trafficking these these drugs because
23:54 it's worth a lot of money and if you're
23:55 standing on a particular Street selling
23:57 a drug and someone else wants your
23:58 position there's gonna be a fight and
24:00 guns started becoming the solution very
24:03 quickly and so it went out went crazy
24:06 well by the 90s all right we start
24:10 having this really interesting twist on
24:13 society we have a lot of this
24:16 interesting well first of all to the
24:18 music when music is fantastic but the
24:21 lyrics are really intense you know these
24:24 gentlemen are doing a fabulous job of
24:27 telling the story of their Cole
24:29 and the violence that they're running
24:30 into however you got kids in safe
24:34 neighborhoods like the ones I grew up in
24:36 the Midwest hearing this loving the
24:39 music and then emulating the lyrics in
24:43 some way shape or form it's not like you
24:46 know a lot of gang violence happened and
24:47 you know middle America necessarily but
24:49 you start having kids talk about the
24:52 whole concept of using a gun and killing
24:54 someone as sort of a first resort
24:56 solution to any conflict that they're
24:59 experiencing in life something that
25:01 before was unthinkable is now being
25:03 indoctrinated into them through this
25:05 huge endorphin rush that they get when
25:08 they listen to great music now in the
25:12 sort of more affluent white
25:14 neighborhoods you might have a bunch of
25:17 kids that that listen to it and
25:19 understand
25:20 hey that's their world I love their
25:22 music but I'm not gonna change my style
25:23 because I live in suburban urban America
25:26 and it's all peaches and cream around
25:29 here we may not be rich but we're not
25:31 dealing with these you know these drug
25:32 cartel problems right so you know and
25:37 I've talked about sort of the demise of
25:38 the stuff in previous episodes but I'm
25:40 just gonna be kind of focusing on how it
25:42 may have turned a little bit dark and a
25:44 little bit violent you know and grunge
25:48 music sorta came out with obviously
25:49 Nirvana leading the way I can I always
25:52 give them the credit for creating that
25:53 genre but they they weren't violent by
25:57 any stretch of the imagination no grunge
25:59 music was really violent but what it did
26:01 was it took the happiness arc that were
26:03 supposed to be enjoying by listening to
26:05 music and it really was just it was
26:07 called grunge for a reason right and
26:10 there was some social messages in some
26:12 of the songs which I think were very
26:14 powerful but overall it was very it was
26:16 sort of you know you've got Green Day
26:18 kind of bringing back sort of a power
26:21 chord punk thing that was really cool
26:24 but the overall tone as I watched in the
26:27 Bay Area in San Francisco area and I
26:29 never lived in San Francisco proper but
26:31 I lived about 30 minutes south but I
26:33 would go to buy tickets for concerts or
26:35 wait in line for albums to debut and
26:37 these other kids are waiting for their
26:40 the latest grunge things or grunge
26:41 tickets and it started you started to
26:43 see society start to dress like hobos it
26:46 was interesting it was this whole
26:47 fashion trend again today we don't you
26:50 know for men it men go into clothing
26:53 stores in 2017 we're still stuck in the
26:55 grunge era right it's how much [ __ ]
26:57 flannel can you buy right it's
26:59 absolutely ridiculous in my opinion we
27:01 have stopped innovating almost entirely
27:03 in a fashion sense you know and but the
27:07 other big appeal to this stuff was that
27:11 when we had sort of you know your your
27:13 70s music and your 80s glam as much as
27:16 that seems a little fruity today it felt
27:19 hard you know you still had your pretty
27:21 heavy bands out there but guitar solos
27:23 felt hard it felt manly and so I can't
27:27 speak for the ladies but for the men we
27:29 sort of need things in our lives that
27:32 make us feel like who we are inside and
27:34 so a lot of that music kind of satiated
27:36 that need for you know listening you
27:38 something rough when you're driving your
27:39 vehicle when you're on a boat on a lake
27:41 when you're doing something in the
27:43 backyard it just kind of brought out
27:45 that sort of alpha male programming that
27:48 most of us have until it gets repressed
27:50 through culture right well in the 90s
27:54 you've got sort of grunge which is sort
27:57 of bitching moan you've got tons of
27:58 money you grew up with the silver spoon
28:00 in your mouth but you're gonna convince
28:01 yourself you're suffering and that
28:03 builds a huge arc of depression in
28:05 society and when you have a huge arc of
28:09 depression it starts to erode all of the
28:12 virtue of man you know the
28:16 disenfranchised today is essentially a
28:18 movement split into all kinds of
28:21 different names that we're now having to
28:24 spend our time wasting our time instead
28:28 of rebuilding our country's rebuilding
28:29 the financial systems in the world
28:32 you know ceasing all these Wars getting
28:34 rid of the bad guys so we have our we
28:36 have these groups that are essentially
28:38 forcing society to waste energy right
28:42 but in video games okay let's rewind
28:45 because we're gonna have to we're gonna
28:47 have to analyze each layer of what we
28:49 think might be happening here
28:51 you had you know cop shows have always
28:55 existed pretty much since television
28:57 came on especially I would say the 70s
29:01 with Columbo and all that kind of stuff
29:02 moving up there's always been some cop
29:05 show out there and what's really
29:06 fascinating about watching old episodes
29:08 of shows that are you know back in these
29:12 eras is that the crime scenes and the
29:15 evidence that's analyzed in these shows
29:17 has grown and grown and grown more
29:18 grotesque and more vivid even beyond
29:21 reality where a body that shot might
29:25 just have a hole in it and a little bit
29:27 of blood no now it's like huge gigantic
29:29 wounds exit wounds gigantic pools of
29:31 blood you know that don't come out of
29:33 human beings all cherry-red all the time
29:35 as if blood doesn't change color once
29:37 it's oxidized and dries up and today
29:41 there's really no limit to what you
29:44 could see a person could be filleted
29:46 they could be burned alive and they'll
29:48 show some prop on television that
29:51 actually looks exactly like that or
29:53 again beyond the way it would look
29:55 similar to movies like seven that came
29:58 out and started showing this kind of
29:59 stuff and so on television we can prove
30:04 just by looking at cop shows look in
30:07 looking at the crime scenes underneath
30:09 the blanket and looking at the forensics
30:11 and analysis at a morgue or something
30:14 that it's gotten really dark with video
30:19 games we've always had usually some sort
30:22 of gun that shoots something even in the
30:25 most primitive game like space invaders
30:27 you've got a little ship down below that
30:28 shooting a missile up and it's hitting
30:30 aliens but the aliens were made cute the
30:32 music was kind of groovy and it wasn't
30:34 really blood and guts right well we know
30:38 that before the 80s were over the
30:39 coin-op games had you know Mortal Kombat
30:42 and Street Fighter and just all kinds of
30:46 titles where you had blood everywhere
30:48 it just happened but it started
30:50 happening more and more as the formulas
30:52 aka patterns of what we considered to be
30:55 entertainment started boiling off and so
30:58 it was ratcheted up ratcheted up and
31:00 they kept fighting you know census
31:03 organizations too
31:04 to keep it out there and eventually when
31:07 I joined Electronic Arts it wasn't there
31:11 was no you know maturity setting or
31:15 maturity labeling on the outside of
31:17 boxes but by 1999 we had this new group
31:20 that which was saying this is mature
31:22 content g-rated what-have-you and today
31:25 we don't really use it to sanction what
31:27 kids see we just use it as a method to
31:29 figure out what games would be like you
31:31 know you might like mature content so
31:32 you're looking for the M I want
31:34 something hardcore so it's really a
31:36 mechanism to buy games and not much in a
31:38 way to keep little kids away from it
31:42 because you know how it works right you
31:43 tell little kids something's forbidden
31:45 and that's the first thing they want to
31:46 smuggle into their world people who are
31:48 big fans of the book Catcher in the Rye
31:50 that book was banned almost the second
31:53 it came out and then it was the most
31:55 sought-after book by kids and so that
31:58 happens when the computers got faster
32:03 the game engines got better and the the
32:06 the medium that Marshall McLuhan talks
32:09 about where he says medium is the
32:10 message he says look the way that you
32:12 get the information is actually slightly
32:14 if not grossly more important than the
32:16 information that you get is is usually
32:19 lost in translation what that really
32:22 means is it's how many senses can you
32:24 engage in the player to convince them
32:26 that what's happening that's actually
32:28 fictional seems real and so as
32:32 technology continues to evolve now we
32:34 have virtual reality we're gonna have
32:36 augmented reality where fiction is gonna
32:37 be blended in with reality again it
32:40 starts off you know all cartoons and
32:42 it's cute and it could get really
32:43 intense right there's a great episode on
32:47 Black Mirror in the third season where
32:49 soldiers are programmed to see other
32:53 human beings as monsters so they kill
32:55 them but they're actually normal but the
32:58 the military industrial complex to the
33:01 Future figured out how to jack into the
33:02 visual cortex of the mind and all the
33:05 emotions all the sight sound hearing all
33:08 that touch and they see something that's
33:10 not there so could you imagine labeling
33:13 a certain race of people with McCain
33:17 to say oh you're not seeing a guy you're
33:20 seeing you know some beast some zombie
33:23 or something right and then you kill it
33:26 but you think you're doing the good good
33:28 for this you know society you're ridding
33:30 society of this huge infestation the 90s
33:34 was a huge turning point because when I
33:37 was in activation drawing games they
33:39 were very fun games sure you killed an
33:42 alien or whatever but the death
33:44 sequences were always goofy and funny
33:46 you know I drew this game that I
33:48 designed called mutant warriors back in
33:50 the day and we had a little guys a
33:51 little isometric game and when you shot
33:53 the guy he fell on his back and he kind
33:55 of dissolved into the ground you could
33:56 see his bones come through the suit and
33:58 that kind of stuff it was kind of funny
33:59 I didn't have big giant pools of blood
34:01 it was unnecessary what pac-man dies
34:04 what does he do he falls on his back and
34:05 he kind of unravels well you still feel
34:08 the same sort of loss that you've that
34:10 you've lost that you have been able to
34:12 continue playing the game indefinitely
34:13 and get the super high score and then we
34:17 had the horse power to start portraying
34:20 human human figures more and more inside
34:22 games for those of you remember the
34:24 tardy 2600 it barely had enough
34:27 horsepower to do anything and so that's
34:29 why every background of every Atari 2600
34:32 game is a mere except for star castle
34:35 which was a very special title but then
34:37 the Intellivision came out and the big
34:38 thing that in television had believe or
34:40 not was a stick figure that could
34:42 actually actuate its legs and arms as it
34:44 ran Tron Mesa Tron was the very best
34:47 version of that in my opinion but then
34:50 of course it gets more and more real the
34:51 coin off games had a lot more horsepower
34:53 she started playing boxing games and
34:55 again Mortal Kombat comes out Virtua
34:57 Fighter comes out things are going 3d
34:58 now so we had the ability to model 3d
35:01 and animate it live well that just got
35:04 the folks more you know power to create
35:10 believable realities and even though you
35:13 guys might look backwards on some of
35:14 these games and just laugh your head off
35:16 how pathetic they look what's really
35:19 fascinating and what's very rarely
35:20 discussed ever effect I'm gonna say I
35:23 probably have never heard it formally
35:25 discussed anywhere in schools but our
35:28 brains took those little tiny
35:30 enhancements
35:30 of reality and we made it reality in our
35:32 mind we were these little stick figures
35:35 you know the SSI boxes that had Dungeons
35:38 & Dragons we were those weird stick
35:40 figure characters which had a little bit
35:41 more color to them
35:43 so each step of the way we're willing to
35:46 allow these sort of bad impressions of
35:48 reality to usurp what we accept as
35:51 reality and when that happens you start
35:53 getting programmed and that's why
35:54 Marshall McLuhan said be very very
35:56 careful how you ingest information
35:58 because the more realistic it is the
36:01 Mord engages your senses the more it's
36:03 going to corrupt the way you think
36:04 you're no longer going to be in control
36:06 of your mind
36:08 well when the internet comes online and
36:10 we finally start getting enough
36:11 bandwidth and server space that doesn't
36:14 cause the gazillions of dollars well
36:16 then we started getting all kinds of
36:17 stuff the first things that happen were
36:19 you know pictures of horrific you know
36:21 crime scenes and then it was movies of
36:24 crimes occurring and now it's just
36:26 completely off the chain right it is my
36:31 hope that that pattern in itself starts
36:33 to wear out where people kind of go yeah
36:35 you know that's old stick I don't need
36:37 to see another you know robbery at a
36:40 convenience store that ends in some
36:42 fatality again once you see 20 of them
36:45 you've seen them all right hoping that
36:47 that's the case but we know now that
36:51 well it makes me finish my other story
36:53 in the 90s Electronic Arts was always
36:56 about sports with a couple side titles
36:58 that were really interesting but I
37:00 watched for the very first time you know
37:04 there are policy towards violence change
37:07 and it happened in the most innocent way
37:10 you could ever imagine
37:11 one of the titles I worked on was called
37:13 knockout Kings which released in 1998
37:16 and I did some of the soundtrack work
37:18 for that and there was a big uproar
37:23 inside the company that we weren't going
37:24 to create quote/unquote a fighting game
37:26 because in their minds they were looking
37:29 at Mortal Kombat and all these kind of
37:30 side-scrolling you know fighter games
37:32 for people falling skelet you know
37:34 skeletal remains out of a person and you
37:37 know a spinal cord out you know with a
37:39 brain and that kind of stuff blood
37:41 gushing everywhere but we're like no
37:42 it's going to be traditional boxing
37:44 was on the front of the box and we did
37:46 all these different fighters in the
37:48 title right well we sold it as a normal
37:54 fighting game and of course it did
37:56 fairly well and it's the franchise I
37:57 believe it still continues
37:58 but that morphed about three years later
38:01 into violent like street fighting type
38:05 gangster battling games it wasn't the
38:08 same engine or the same company anything
38:09 like that but we had kind of oiled down
38:11 this whole thing that that Electronic
38:14 Arts couldn't do that and part of it had
38:17 to do with the bottom line other
38:19 companies were creating horrific games
38:22 when you really they feel like if you
38:24 put yourself inside of Grand Theft Auto
38:27 for instance hey you know if again if
38:30 you're intelligent and you see it from
38:32 some 60,000 points view it's a game and
38:36 you know it's not reality but in the end
38:39 if you play that game from start to
38:41 finish
38:41 you've killed a ton of people you've
38:44 killed it as part of the narration of
38:46 the game and you've killed it just to
38:47 get from point A to point B so in
38:49 yourself your brain has said I kill
38:51 people and if anyone gets in my way
38:54 even just driving down the street I
38:56 don't have any problem with killing
38:58 anyone who's crossing this street I
39:00 don't any problem driving on a sidewalk
39:02 and killing people right consequently
39:06 the first drive-in theater movie I ever
39:08 saw was was Cannonball Run and death
39:12 race 2000 this is probably in 77 78
39:16 somewhere in there you guys can look up
39:18 the movie and death race 2000 was really
39:22 unprecedented film now we had a lot of
39:24 scary films you know we had Exorcist
39:26 which to this day Exorcist one is pretty
39:30 amazing right but inside death race 2000
39:33 the whole thing is to go from point A to
39:34 point B and kill as many human beings as
39:36 possible and the more rare the human
39:38 being the higher score you got so they
39:41 were making movies like that but it was
39:42 very very nice sheet and rare and
39:45 there's always some uproar and protest
39:47 about them ever showing those films in
39:49 movie theaters you know Exorcist got
39:51 kicked out of a lot of theaters just
39:53 tons of movies back in those days the
39:54 society was still pushing back on
39:56 conditioning of mankind first most of
40:00 you know that when Elvis Presley danced
40:02 on television they thought his pelvis
40:04 gyrations were too much and it did
40:06 affect the way that the sixties evolves
40:09 he kind of unlocked the door and then
40:11 about ten years later you have just this
40:14 incredible revolution in sexual
40:17 promiscuity we have you know for neural
40:20 diseases that exploded all over the
40:22 world because of that you know it was it
40:23 was we didn't win we didn't win that
40:26 race we kind of spread our wings and got
40:31 a lot of experimentation out but we kind
40:33 of lost at the end of the game right but
40:36 today we live in a much different world
40:38 right we have sort of no limitation to
40:44 any violence that you can conceive of
40:47 there's there's forgot the title but
40:49 there's a brand new game coming out
40:50 which looks like a charg Eagers
40:52 amusement park where you know you're
40:57 you're in the bowels of hell basically
40:58 you're inside sort of that HR Giger
41:01 alien world running around with demons
41:04 coming at you and just it's all pain and
41:06 suffering the very fabric of the game
41:08 itself is pain and suffering the walls
41:10 look like they're suffering right so
41:12 we've had a lot of groups that have been
41:15 sort of hidden away operating behind
41:18 closed doors little secret societies and
41:19 that kind of thing that can now fund
41:21 games to indoctrinate children into
41:24 these horrific thought processes right
41:27 where again the major thing is is the
41:29 value of life I probably should have
41:32 started off with that analogy the value
41:35 of life say in 1970 was very high and
41:39 today I think the value of life I don't
41:42 know what it is but it's not I wouldn't
41:44 call it high because we see it all the
41:47 time when you turn on the television
41:49 let's just say you had an experiment you
41:52 had 15 minutes with a remote control and
41:54 you want a prize and you have to see
41:57 someone die on television fictional or
41:59 real probably more fictional than real
42:01 right
42:02 but you dial around I don't think you're
42:04 gonna be worried about winning that
42:05 jackpot in 15 minutes because you know
42:07 you can find a show where someone's
42:08 being shot
42:09 something's happening even if it's funny
42:12 right now with the Internet we did get a
42:15 huge reprisal of classic video games
42:17 that don't have a lot of death in them
42:19 so that's kind of nice there's you know
42:21 some of the most popular games on mobile
42:23 devices have no death in them that is
42:25 the least bit realistic you don't think
42:27 about it in any way that you map it to
42:30 yourself there's what is it the
42:32 beautiful game flower that came out with
42:34 the PlayStation 3 remarkably beautiful
42:37 game they just sequels it just recently
42:38 and so there's a lot of really fun
42:40 things tetris didn't have any death to
42:42 it you know Rubik's cubes didn't have
42:43 death associated with it but again those
42:45 patterns are over we're not engaging in
42:48 that form of entertainment anymore
42:49 because it's just not that exciting
42:52 right it's not new to the mind I will
42:58 say this there are video games out video
43:00 game companies out there that are
43:01 actually founded by former drug cartel
43:03 heads and they made a lot of money in
43:06 drugs and they took it and they
43:08 laundered it into video games and I
43:11 won't identify them but I'll simply say
43:13 that their games are the most violent
43:15 games in the world bar none all right so
43:19 they took their real-life experience and
43:21 they boiled it in now a lot of these
43:23 game companies that are like that
43:24 there's only a few but they've managed
43:26 to kind of go past a little bit of that
43:28 some of them have franchises the people
43:30 demand gets equaled and so they keep
43:32 upping the carnage you know how could
43:34 you sequel a game that's all about blood
43:36 and guts you know you can't reduce the
43:39 amount of blood and guts right because
43:40 then we're going backwards in the
43:41 pattern and there was a brilliant
43:45 expansion pack to World of Warcraft that
43:51 Chris Metz and I believe I have his
43:54 symbolism and metaphor and thought
43:56 process correctly paraphrase for you but
44:00 he created the one called mists of
44:02 pandaria and it was sort of this panda
44:06 world that really restarts kind of based
44:10 on Japanese lore or a lot of the kind of
44:13 Asian sense of honor right and he was
44:18 interviewed at the Blizzcon before it
44:20 came out because a lot of us saw it and
44:21 we thought it we're looking at you know
44:24 the movie with Jack Black in the Panda
44:25 was a I forgot the name of it sorry keep
44:31 thinking Panda Express which is the
44:32 restaurant but they came to him and said
44:35 look it doesn't look that violent
44:36 doesn't look that amazing and he said
44:39 well why don't we take a break from
44:42 violence why don't we just learn to dig
44:45 each other and let's have some honor
44:47 among men and this little tiny interview
44:50 and you could see a minute first I was
44:52 going into this expansion thinking it
44:54 was going to suckers on my favorite ones
44:55 they ever did and I watched him sit at
44:57 the table at his own you know Blizzcon
45:01 and after he said whatever the hell he
45:04 said which I believe like just
45:06 paraphrased it properly I all of a
45:08 sudden felt great and I was like oh my
45:09 god you know I there are people in power
45:12 that actually are seeing the same thing
45:14 I'm seeing and they're trying to kind of
45:15 undo the darkness of it all and you know
45:17 World of Warcraft really doesn't have
45:19 any vivid realistic deaths
45:23 it does make you kill things constantly
45:25 so again in your brain you're killing
45:27 constantly no matter what it is and you
45:31 know part of it has to do with one of
45:33 these things that says as long as you're
45:37 killing a bad guy you're okay the
45:40 problem with that formula is if someone
45:42 can convince you that a good person is a
45:43 bad person then you're screwed and
45:45 that's what essentially a lot of the
45:48 wars that are going on do you know
45:51 imagine a person of a certain race if
45:54 badger than in your brain I'm not gonna
45:55 say any cuz there's no need to and they
45:58 do something really bad or maybe there's
45:59 a collection of them maybe even a
46:01 thousand of them to do something really
46:02 really bad and in your brain you're
46:05 trying to create pattern recognition for
46:07 evil and darkness and try to keep
46:08 yourself safe and your family safe but
46:12 in your brain you start spreading it out
46:15 over all these different races our
46:18 series everyone in everyone of that
46:20 color excuse me and you're trying to
46:22 discern who's good and who's bad you
46:26 don't have the means to do that so you
46:28 just cut your losses and save that whole
46:31 race is like that that's not the truth
46:34 it's not that truth about any race on
46:36 Play
46:36 right how many Sikhs were attacked after
46:41 9/11 because they happened to wear a
46:43 headdress they're not remotely related
46:47 with even the propaganda of who did 9/11
46:50 right but they're being attacked when I
46:53 was in the Bay Area there was all kinds
46:55 of horrible stories about people walking
46:56 down a sidewalk getting out of cars
46:58 getting chased by people and beaten up
47:02 they had nothing to do with anything so
47:06 the other thing you need to know all
47:08 right is that this is an all willy-nilly
47:10 randomness and I'll remind you of a
47:13 story I told probably in season one I'm
47:15 at a game developers conference in San
47:17 Francisco I'm in the Moscone Center and
47:19 I'm getting my food in the morning and
47:21 I'm gonna sit down a little table and
47:22 eat and I bump into this woman she's got
47:26 a British accent she looks a little
47:28 geeky but she doesn't look like she
47:29 plays video games looks like she's a
47:31 little out of the pocket little older
47:32 and I'm looking at I'm saying what are
47:35 you doing here you know she says that
47:38 she works for the British government in
47:40 the military but more at a sort of area
47:42 51 over there she said that the base
47:44 that she worked on the Prime Minister of
47:46 England has to get permission to visit
47:48 that's how secret that place is the only
47:50 place we have like that for my to my
47:53 knowledge is like really area 51 and I'm
47:57 sure there's plenty of other think tanks
47:58 that have the same restrictions but she
48:02 said I am here because I I and my group
48:07 are trying to figure out what makes kids
48:09 want to play video games and so we
48:12 started talking and you know I'm the way
48:15 I am she had no idea so she said you
48:18 know we started talking she got really
48:19 interested in my perception of this
48:21 stuff because I've always been a big
48:22 into the neurology of why people like to
48:25 play games similar to been a Nintendo
48:27 team in Japan and she said you mind if I
48:30 send you a little question here after
48:32 get back to the UK and I said oh that'd
48:34 be great
48:34 gave her my email I got home she sent me
48:38 this Word document that was huge
48:40 put tons and tons of questions and I was
48:43 extremely busy running my game company
48:45 and I had to essentially bow out of it
48:47 and the funny thing was I started kind
48:50 of
48:50 asking her if she knew about the
48:52 Bilderberg Group and I referred a couple
48:54 books to her and then boom it just shut
48:57 off it was amazing how because she
48:59 replied back once and she says no I
49:01 never heard of that
49:01 oh yeah sure send me over the content
49:03 and she basically disappeared out of my
49:08 communication but someone was trying to
49:11 figure out why kids play video games and
49:15 it's from a military analysis standpoint
49:18 right now I can't imagine this person is
49:22 the only person trying to do this or
49:23 what have you because they don't need to
49:25 visit game conferences to actually get
49:27 the real data they can just sit around
49:29 and think about it and they probably
49:30 figure all the stuff out they need to
49:32 figure out and I think they figured it
49:33 out there was also a huge effusion of
49:38 cash from the army into one of these
49:41 first-person shooter companies in sort
49:45 of the early 2000s where they were
49:46 financing were genre games now why they
49:50 were doing that I don't know because the
49:52 regular game companies were taking full
49:54 advantage of the opportunity and they
49:56 were doing a brilliant job at it much
49:57 better than these games that this army
49:59 subsidy relationship was creating but
50:04 why would they do that well we know that
50:07 there's there's according to Nick
50:08 Rockefeller you know they're trying to
50:09 create a hundred year war we can't find
50:11 the enemy because it's always some
50:13 agency with a name and of course the
50:16 propaganda has always points back
50:18 directly to the group that they want you
50:20 to hate so that when they want to
50:22 finance a war or you're right there
50:24 because you know you're trying to
50:25 protect yourself it's hard to be
50:27 informed about all the evil things in
50:29 the world when you're trying to provide
50:30 for your family and work a job and
50:32 sustain right so let's talk about sort
50:38 of what to do today what do we do today
50:39 about this because if you're a parent of
50:42 a child you know for a fact that if
50:44 something is really really popular and
50:46 you take it away from your child or try
50:48 to demonize it or expose it to your
50:50 child you are stuck inside of a
50:52 consumerism bubble where your child is
50:55 essentially measuring measuring their
50:57 love for you based on what you give them
50:59 because now every holiday is a gigantic
51:00 spending extravaganza right
51:03 so you know that there's a huge problem
51:05 there I have bumped into plenty of
51:08 parents who have done amazing jobs I
51:10 mean jobs that I I almost wonder how
51:14 they're able to pull it off because kids
51:16 always go to school you know there are
51:18 some home school kids and there's a lot
51:20 of benefits to that as well as long as
51:22 the parents are educated enough to
51:23 actually pull it off right but if you
51:26 wanted to sanction you know violence to
51:29 your family well there's gonna be very
51:32 few shows you can ever play on
51:34 television there are I mean I did a
51:39 whole show on Westworld
51:40 tons of death and sex and Westworld
51:43 right I like Deadwood I like Rome but
51:46 I'm an adult I know what I'm looking at
51:48 but I'm not immune from the conditioning
51:51 or the D sensitivity of horrific things
51:54 but it's a job to watch a show have it
51:58 affect your mind and then at the end of
52:00 the day sort of take all the junk out
52:02 and throw it away it's a very tough
52:04 endeavor and so I wouldn't say it's for
52:08 the the weak of heart to go in and
52:11 commit to ingesting bad content and then
52:13 getting yourself out of it's damage
52:15 right but the simple simple answer is
52:19 essentially the doctor that seems to
52:21 have very little bedside manner but
52:23 they're telling you the actual truth of
52:24 your condition they're telling you you
52:28 can't eat certain foods and you can't do
52:30 certain things or you're gonna die now
52:35 if you're a parent I'm just gonna tell
52:38 you or I'll ask you why did you have
52:40 children in the first place why did you
52:42 have kids so you can have some company
52:44 sometimes that's the answer a lot of you
52:46 have children because you want to see
52:48 the lineage of your family move forward
52:50 you don't want to just die and that's it
52:52 your gene stops and so you have children
52:54 okay well you're usually a good parent
52:58 and you're trying to help your kids see
53:00 as much as they can see you enlighten
53:02 them you give them as much knowledge as
53:04 they can as you can give them in the
53:06 time that you have them at your disposal
53:07 before they enter the world or rebel
53:10 against you or what have you and so you
53:13 know in my experience and going back
53:15 over my own lifestyle
53:17 those first 10 years are massively
53:19 important and being extremely honest
53:21 with your kid really allows them to
53:24 trust you and to know even if the
53:26 information is not what they wanted to
53:28 hear and they might pout and yell and
53:29 call you names and whatever they're
53:31 hearing you they're hearing you and they
53:34 don't want that information to be true
53:38 when you have to break it to your kid if
53:40 you raise your kid on Santa Claus
53:41 eventually you have to break it too and
53:42 then he's not a real dude all right well
53:45 you know that it's not a happy day for
53:47 them and they might get angry at you but
53:50 eventually they wake up and they find
53:52 out you're telling the truth and that
53:53 you had societal pressures to raise them
53:55 in that whole thing and they cut you a
53:58 blank check but you're going to have to
54:00 do two steps one you're going to have to
54:02 increase your sensitivity to all this
54:06 death and violence you might choose to
54:08 let them see a little bit because you
54:10 think well they're gonna go out from
54:12 under my wing at some point and if
54:13 society doesn't stop but I want my kid
54:15 to be naive to the world and so you
54:18 might let a little bit in you might
54:20 choose to describe it verbally and not
54:22 let them see it visually so they're a
54:25 little bit prepared but they don't have
54:26 these scars where they're trying to grow
54:27 up and figure out how to you know find a
54:31 partner or find a job or steady heart
54:33 right these are all basic things that
54:35 know a lot of you know but how many of
54:37 us really want to do that
54:38 right the other one is to simply
54:41 supplant entertainment at your house
54:43 very intense enjoyable things that have
54:46 none of this stuff in it such that your
54:49 kid really doesn't have any preference
54:50 for the darkness right when I raise my
54:53 kid I thought that repetitive repetition
54:58 of films was going to build her memory
55:01 beautifully and it worked like a charm
55:03 so I picked out a bunch of movies that I
55:06 thought have absolutely no chance of
55:10 hurting her mind like Wizard of Oz the
55:13 original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate
55:14 Factory
55:15 the movie explorers and that kind of
55:17 stuff really fun-loving films there's a
55:19 bunch more in there three amigos and
55:21 that kind of stuff and you know three
55:22 amigos has a few gun battles and extra
55:25 stuff but it's it's almost like there's
55:27 no pain in any of the deaths it's where
55:29 the old
55:29 comedy right but I kept her away from
55:32 anything that was going to go
55:33 you know racist anything that was going
55:35 to go blood guts and so my kid she loved
55:41 these things she loved the franchises
55:43 and so her guttural preference is to
55:46 steer away from the darkness because she
55:48 was never addicted to it in the first
55:50 place and even though it is a new
55:51 pattern to her the horrific nature of
55:53 those patterns is now understood by her
55:56 because she's like hey when I grew up I
55:58 didn't have the stuff in my life to the
56:00 best of my ability I gave my kid a 1970s
56:03 upbringing you know in the late 90s
56:06 early 2000s and so she got to probably
56:09 2005 and never knew anything about what
56:12 was going on she didn't need to she
56:15 couldn't affect any change in it anyway
56:16 right so we protected her brain but the
56:21 other one that you don't really think
56:22 about a lot is your own in gestation of
56:26 the stuff your own consumption of this
56:28 stuff even though you're a grown adult
56:31 maybe you've been to war maybe you
56:33 suffer from the tiny bit of PTSD you can
56:36 get PTSD without going to war by the way
56:38 any traumatic situation where you may
56:41 have lost consciousness for a split
56:43 second you can't really find an origin
56:45 to what happened to you and this emotion
56:47 swims around inside your mind it makes
56:48 you feel angsty it could be someone
56:50 shouting at your face and nothing to do
56:53 with getting hurt now let me just
56:56 utterly close on this concept because
56:57 I'm losing my light here we all walk
57:01 around with a sort of state of being a
57:03 frequency that is either happy or sad or
57:07 somewhere in between
57:09 you could feel angry and you won't even
57:10 know why it's like a weird subtle PTSD
57:15 some of you will be aware of this and
57:17 you will say to yourself or a close
57:18 friend I don't know I just feel angsty I
57:21 feel strange I feel sad for some reason
57:23 I don't know why you know and we know
57:25 that females struggle with certain
57:27 cycles sometimes some females do some
57:28 females don't but outside of any of that
57:31 stuff right just a normal should be a
57:33 wonderful day there's nothing
57:35 biologically going on in terms of a
57:37 cycle you get to the point where like
57:39 you know I need to stop this because
57:41 it's really eating me alive today and
57:42 you sit there and you search you search
57:44 in your brain for what's going on at
57:47 that point you need to be utterly and
57:48 completely honest with yourself about
57:50 everything review I do it out loud so I
57:52 can hear my own voice it really speeds
57:55 up the process but you I review things
57:57 if why I might feel a certain way and
57:59 it's usually within no more than five
58:01 minutes I mean probably a two minutes I
58:03 figured out what it is and sometimes I
58:06 need to make a phone call and talk to
58:07 somebody and say you know this thing
58:09 that happened between us you don't want
58:10 to make sure we're all good with that
58:11 right sometimes you could just be sheer
58:14 lack of social interaction you got I
58:16 gotta go I gotta go talk to a friend I
58:17 got to go hang out with somebody you
58:18 know I've been cooped up working too
58:20 much today and I got to get out and see
58:22 things so when it comes to violence in
58:25 your life there's no part of the human
58:29 psyche that enjoys it to be honest even
58:31 if we got up and hunted for our food
58:33 every single day there's a part of you
58:35 that might feel the adrenaline rush of
58:37 the whole thing especially when you're
58:38 victorious in a hunting exercise but in
58:41 the end you really wish that you didn't
58:43 have to do that because there's always a
58:45 chance you could get hurt and when you
58:48 have these fictitious things in your
58:49 brain for instance if you were to watch
58:51 I don't know a bunch of home invasion
58:54 videos or something like that you might
58:56 start being paranoid that your home can
58:58 be invaded really easily so you buy a
58:59 bunch of guns and you can never relax in
59:02 your own home you never feel safe right
59:04 well that's just justice to you because
59:07 the odds are stacked way against that
59:09 ever happening to you I don't mean don't
59:12 be don't protect yourself and that kind
59:14 of stuff but if we can just start to say
59:18 look I know that that show exists on
59:21 television I don't watch it because it's
59:23 really violent it's a cop worship show
59:25 that just gets gross or you know here's
59:29 a video game out there that is just all
59:31 blood and guts and there's no fictional
59:33 spin on it that makes it sort of
59:35 acceptable all right because there's
59:38 again world of warcraft kills a lot of
59:40 people there's a lot of video games that
59:41 kill a lot of things you need to study
59:43 every single minut detail of that
59:46 because it is very real for you believe
59:48 it or not nobody wants to be controlled
59:53 and that's the other resistance factor
59:56 don't control me I want to live a
59:57 completely free life to do everything
59:58 that I want and I'm not saying you
60:00 shouldn't try to pursue that sort of
60:02 lifestyle but if you did have a choice
60:05 to eat food that's good for you and food
60:07 is bad for you you know if you eat the
60:09 food that's bad for you it's only called
60:11 bad for you because it's either gonna
60:12 shorten your lifespan or make you feel
60:14 like crap or both so you obviously you
60:18 probably do it like most of us do it and
60:20 you do it in moderation
60:21 I hate something that's ridiculous that
60:23 I that makes me feel good but in the end
60:26 you know you see the extra pound on your
60:27 body your heart doesn't function
60:29 properly you don't sleep well and so
60:31 over time you start to pull this out of
60:33 your cycle and I think that's what we
60:36 have to do with violence in the world as
60:39 it is portrayed to us in a way that
60:40 doesn't need to exist it's bad enough
60:43 that the news brings you every horrific
60:44 tale on planet earth right things that
60:47 happened that you couldn't possibly
60:48 affect change you know right now as of
60:51 October what is it 15 2017 the news has
60:55 got probably four or five abduction
60:58 murder stories that are constantly being
61:02 updated on the front page of every news
61:04 outlet in the world because they're
61:05 making money off that death they dig
61:08 that right and there's nothing you can
61:10 do if someone's passed away that's it
61:12 the local law enforcement will catch
61:14 them if they're still out and about you
61:16 don't need to hear a horrific story to
61:18 make you go into some trauma traumatic
61:19 phase of your life or to ruin your day
61:21 or make you feel tense you might read
61:24 something maybe you have a brand-new
61:25 newborn you read oh newborn was snatched
61:28 and murdered and you're like oh my god I
61:30 got a newborn I got to protect my
61:31 newborn I got a really extra protect my
61:33 newborn because I read this article
61:34 about something happening in Tunisia you
61:38 don't need to read it you don't need to
61:40 make your life horrible and if you want
61:42 to study the world when that wasn't the
61:45 case you studied the various areas of
61:47 the world in say the mid 50s when the
61:50 newspapers weren't on the internet when
61:52 television shows didn't report things
61:54 that were horrific because they knew
61:56 there was nothing you could do about it
61:57 they sanctioned the news a little bit to
61:59 make sure it was a more positive
62:00 constructive thing about what does
62:02 matter in your life if there's a new
62:04 president running you've got
62:05 no the issues if there's new policies in
62:07 your local area you got to know the
62:08 issues if there's a recall on a drug you
62:11 should know the issues right because it
62:13 might affect you
62:14 so that's a quick one our on I think
62:18 violence and culture I just skimmed the
62:20 surface but I don't think you want to
