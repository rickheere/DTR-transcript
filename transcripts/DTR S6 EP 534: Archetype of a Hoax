00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen
00:39 okay i thought today we just talked
00:42 about the archetype
00:45 of hoaxes because it just occurred to me
00:48 recently
00:49 and what i'm about to say is is
00:51 something that you will kind of go oh
00:53 yeah of course whatever you know and
00:54 then uh when you really think about how
00:56 to
00:58 really pull the archetypal
01:01 attributes sequence sequences
01:05 really just a sequence of how hoax have
01:09 been portrayed over time
01:11 especially the ones where we know they
01:15 did it on purpose then i think it helps
01:18 us understand how
01:20 future events are going to
01:24 be used to manipulate mankind
01:27 because if you think about it if you go
01:29 back to a point in in
01:30 world history where we were sort of in
01:34 that
01:34 richter vase you know the invention of a
01:36 lie movie where no one lied in the
01:39 whole planet just a few
01:43 you know people crossed that line and
01:45 probably even did it accidentally at
01:46 first and then
01:47 i was like oh that was kind of cool it's
01:49 i got some benefits out of that one
01:53 i told her i was an astronaut at the bar
01:55 we have all kinds of names for
01:58 deceptive lying moments
02:01 hoax being one of them yeah the other
02:04 ones have to do with the way that uh
02:06 information comes to you could be
02:08 propaganda
02:10 then there are you know false flags
02:13 there are
02:15 a bunch of those negative ones but at
02:17 the same time
02:19 we have magic tricks don't we
02:23 we have all kinds of venues were in in
02:26 moments where we actually pay people to
02:29 pull hoaxes
02:30 hoaxes gotta hate that word on us
02:34 for entertainment reasons because we
02:36 like to be surprised we like to see the
02:38 impossible
02:39 become possible now if any of you are
02:41 like magicians or something
02:43 um i'm gonna make you probably laugh
02:46 because you're gonna be way more
02:47 skilled at this than myself
02:51 i suppose you could be magicians in
02:53 several
02:54 of these categories you know we
02:57 typically think because we're humans our
03:00 perception
03:01 of humanity is pretty dialed in
03:05 and i don't know exactly what if 100 was
03:08 totally dialed in
03:09 i'm not sure exactly what percentage
03:11 makes us start hitting expert levels
03:13 don't know
03:15 but there are some things that
03:18 are positive that we don't think about
03:22 which are keys to the mind of man
03:26 i think you're gonna dig this if i made
03:29 you laugh constantly when you
03:33 hung around me i could just infect your
03:36 very existence
03:37 no matter what we're doing i can make it
03:40 funny
03:40 and i can do it dry i can do it slap
03:43 sticky i can do whatever let's just say
03:46 and you're just laughing constantly now
03:48 before you go
03:49 attend a writing class or you know
03:51 figure you know talk to someone super
03:53 wise about these things
03:54 you ever wonder why you laugh in the
03:56 first place like what's causing this
03:58 little
03:59 burp phonic out of your body
04:03 you know without knowing that the more
04:05 you laugh you feel wonderful you feel
04:07 potentially relieved
04:09 when you know you just all pent up and
04:11 you really have something you're
04:12 focusing on
04:13 and it's making you angry and someone
04:15 walks in and either makes that thing
04:17 that's making you angry
04:19 funny somehow or better yet they totally
04:23 hit you from a right angle
04:27 turn something totally different and you
04:30 laugh they take your mind off of it then
04:33 you feel better because you're not
04:34 processing
04:34 the negativity right that'll happen all
04:37 day long and you won't know why
04:40 or what it is how it's psychologically
04:43 happening
04:44 and then after the psychological trigger
04:46 how the body
04:47 treats it that's getting a little bit
04:50 better because the internet's around and
04:51 you have little doctors articles well i
04:53 heard this i heard that
04:55 so that is helping you ever think
04:58 why beings orgasm
05:03 now i'm going to give you two two
05:05 scenarios so you can think it through
05:07 but honestly either one is pretty
05:09 phenomenal
05:10 pretty amazing design pretty strange
05:13 thing now
05:14 most of us who believe we were designed
05:18 and you could be an evolutionist and
05:19 still accept design
05:21 through sheer survival of fitness sort
05:24 of thing
05:25 we needed to feel really good
05:27 procreating
05:29 so the orgasm was just like this little
05:31 piece of candy
05:32 after you did well at the dentist which
05:34 was always really funny
05:36 here rot your teeth see you later use
05:39 that toothpaste billy
05:41 but there's a conceptual thing going on
05:43 inside
05:45 your consciousness which could be
05:48 located partly in the soul
05:49 partly in the mind it also triggers a
05:52 body effect
05:53 of course now when you're with somebody
05:55 else
05:56 and you're having this experience it's
05:59 i think a little easier to understand
06:01 even though we don't
06:02 or it's easy to feel like you understand
06:04 it but we really don't understand it
06:06 i mean obviously you know how to make it
06:08 happen
06:10 but why is your body erupting
06:13 with all kinds of just wild stuff going
06:15 on now there's people that have a very
06:17 mental one
06:17 and there's people that have purely
06:19 physical ones
06:21 people with problems actually doing it
06:24 uh are typically people with just a
06:26 physical
06:27 imprintation imprint on imprintation
06:31 imprint on the moment right they are uh
06:34 they're just waiting for the mechanics
06:35 of their body to give them sensory input
06:37 to have that
06:38 that climactic moment when you can
06:41 be with the right person and it's
06:43 conceptually amazing
06:45 then the event becomes 97 percent mental
06:48 three percent physical
06:49 and that kind of person has them when
06:51 the wind blows too hard
06:53 but now the most amazing thing about
06:56 uh you're you're like i clicked on a
06:58 video about or uh the hoaxes and i got
07:00 this orgasm talk
07:02 love this channel now you're by yourself
07:06 and you are getting a climax at some
07:10 in moment obviously there's some
07:13 physical involved but a lot of people
07:17 realize that you know you are putting
07:19 something into your head
07:21 that is getting your body to the
07:22 emotional state
07:25 of climaxing but you're doing that all
07:28 by yourself you were constructing
07:30 a fictional thing in your head whether
07:32 you'd be watching something or watching
07:33 something inside your mind
07:36 i don't know people can do it without
07:38 any input
07:39 sure that's possible i think you're
07:41 always thinking of something you
07:42 remember
07:43 thinking of something or not i think you
07:44 are why am i going on about this
07:48 because i think you have to understand
07:51 that there is a tremendous frontier of
07:54 unknown associations within the human
07:57 mind
07:58 that are going to control how a hoax can
08:00 be pulled off on you
08:02 anything that can manipulate you you
08:04 have to find out whether you're naive
08:06 about something
08:07 whether you feel like you're really
08:08 weathered about something
08:10 it really has to do with just you know
08:12 fool me one shame on you
08:13 fool me twice shame on me meaning
08:17 hey anyone can trick someone one time
08:20 but you should learn
08:22 the archetype of the trick and therefore
08:24 not be tricked again so if you're
08:26 foolish enough to be tricked again
08:29 well you gotta stop and meditate a
08:31 little bit
08:33 now i've never really known anyone that
08:36 has ever had that truly happen
08:38 if you feel like you have been tricked a
08:40 second time
08:42 the odds are that variables changed
08:46 enough
08:46 that it wasn't like the first one you
08:49 didn't get the indicators of the first
08:50 one
08:51 but there's the old one there's the old
08:54 little trick
08:55 where someone walks up and depending on
08:57 the frequency
08:58 they'll say oh you got something on your
09:00 shirt and you look down and they flick
09:02 your nose
09:03 or you know and so they'll you'll be
09:05 like oh my god that was good that was
09:06 good crazy
09:07 weird the next time they don't say the
09:10 same phrase
09:11 they they'll say something like oh god
09:13 what's that you know or
09:16 is this your is this your badge you know
09:17 or whatever and they'll flick you in the
09:19 face
09:19 they're going for the same physical
09:21 archetype of i'm going to do something
09:23 and distract them
09:24 to look down and then i'm going to pop
09:26 them in the nose
09:27 so the trick is looking down is the
09:30 variable
09:31 the trigger to make you look down is the
09:33 variable now i realize that might have
09:35 been a little
09:36 cerebral we're supposed to be talking
09:38 about the archetypes of hoaxes
09:40 so what kind of hoaxes are out there
09:43 well there's so many aren't there
09:45 the one that came to mind
09:49 the archetype that came to mind when i
09:51 first thought about doing this episode
09:52 about uh 10 minutes ago
09:55 was the the classic ufo sighting
09:59 i watched the deep fi our dark five
10:00 episode today which was
10:02 so far back he wasn't narrating yet
10:05 but it was a picture of a guy or sorry
10:07 it was a picture a guy took
10:10 outside of his farm of a creature
10:14 that just looked like some maybe
10:17 a person suffering from dwarfism
10:20 and may have journeyed out may have been
10:26 could have been homeless person who just
10:27 happened to have dwarfism
10:29 so they're not dressed the way that a
10:30 human is normally dressed don't know
10:33 it could be that he has a friend that
10:35 looks a little strange and he got him to
10:36 pose could be a
10:37 could be a mistaken or an accidental
10:40 moment where
10:41 again you catch somebody out in the
10:43 wilderness and they're maybe having to
10:45 relieve themselves because they're just
10:46 uh in between bathrooms at that point in
10:49 their life
10:50 and so you snap a shot and it looks
10:53 funky in the camera and then you start
10:54 telling a story
10:56 think about all these photographs that
10:57 have been taken over the years
10:59 especially the the little girl in the
11:02 spacesuit one i covered
11:03 i can't remember what episode that was
11:06 turns out it's the mom standing behind
11:08 the kid
11:09 but it was just the way that the light
11:11 hit the their mom's back it looked like
11:14 a spaceship and it was gleaning off of
11:16 things that weren't the things that you
11:17 thought they were
11:18 but because pattern recognition in the
11:20 mind
11:22 you know it's not trying to mess with
11:24 you it's trying to resolve things
11:26 again when you start to learn the lookup
11:29 table between
11:31 the i guess we'll call it english
11:34 alphabet
11:36 and the original hieroglyphs and you see
11:39 that a bird
11:40 sitting on a perch is a lowercase a you
11:42 know like i went off
11:43 you know a u is a bowl an o is a noose
11:47 w m and n are all waves in the ocean
11:51 once you start seeing those you you're
11:53 oh yeah
11:54 you know i get it okay cool you know
11:56 many of the photographs back in the day
11:58 in the 50s at least the united states of
12:00 these ufo sightings were
12:03 farmers throwing things from hubcaps
12:07 to big giant gears
12:10 and just tossing it and getting a kid to
12:14 take a shot
12:16 and then you you go get them developed
12:18 maybe your buddy even develops them
12:20 then you guys just purposely sift out
12:24 the one that looks real and of course
12:26 they give it to a photo expert
12:28 who i don't know what the hell you could
12:29 have done in the 50s other than maybe
12:32 try to determine whether the negative
12:34 had been spliced
12:36 and it checks out more elaborate folks
12:39 well
12:39 geez they could build in a machine shop
12:43 a truly fictional ufo
12:47 like a prop in a movie they could put it
12:50 on a crane
12:51 lift it up really high and then at some
12:54 point they can pull a lever and it
12:56 detaches and it's going to fall it'll be
12:58 destroyed the minute hits the ground
13:01 but you have four or five cameras and
13:03 you're taking pictures
13:05 and oh my god it's real then you get
13:08 into the archetype
13:10 in any case where a ufo is truly
13:14 detailed in view usually only one person
13:18 in the entire world's
13:19 got a picture of it or ever seen it when
13:22 it's lights in the sky
13:24 then everybody sees it because it's just
13:27 balls of light
13:28 which could be military exercise
13:30 dropping flares
13:31 it could be i mean could be even to do
13:33 it to create the illusion
13:36 but the other one is uh plasma
13:40 energy leaking from the crust of the
13:41 earth in a desert
13:43 phoenix lights you know in the lights
13:46 over um
13:47 washington dc i think over the capitol
13:50 building
13:51 we're utterly wild to look at there's
13:54 the foo fighters i guess
13:56 was it los angeles or something one
13:59 thing i want to remind you about
14:02 things like that that might be a factor
14:05 i've heard it every once in a while but
14:07 it's not
14:08 mentioned that often your enemy wants to
14:12 remind you how close they can get to you
14:15 they may have no intention
14:17 of warring with you and they know that
14:20 you're sophisticated enough that they're
14:22 not
14:23 you're not going to react in war with
14:24 them even if they show you how close
14:26 they can get to you
14:28 but now imagine some of these exercises
14:30 are russia
14:33 putting some aircraft over washington dc
14:35 dropping flares
14:36 on parachutes or maybe even synthesizing
14:40 a little bit of plasma energy
14:42 just knowing when you burp these things
14:43 into the atmosphere they tend to
14:46 rest i don't think those are what those
14:48 were
14:50 when barack obama became president in
14:53 2009
14:54 very very early after he took presidency
14:57 if i have the year right
14:58 we had a missile shot out of a submarine
15:00 off the coast of
15:01 california i think it was
15:04 port weinemy but i've seen the picture
15:09 and they kept denying to the public that
15:11 they knew what this thing was
15:13 well it could have been but the
15:16 assertion
15:16 uh i guess in the communities that tried
15:18 to follow these kind of things
15:20 was that the submarine was from that it
15:23 was a submarine and that it was from
15:24 china
15:25 and all they were doing is sending a
15:26 message saying this is how close we can
15:28 get to you
15:29 yeah maybe it's romantic that way but
15:32 maybe not who knows
15:34 could have been a local inventor but say
15:37 that these things happen and the
15:39 government finds out very quickly
15:40 and that's yeah that was a good one
15:43 russians dropped a bunch of
15:44 ufo looking dots over the capitol
15:46 building a bunch of people took pictures
15:49 of it
15:49 now we obviously can't tell the people
15:51 that russia can get that close to us
15:52 because
15:54 in our own hubris we want to believe
15:56 that everyone else is stupider than we
15:58 are
15:58 so we'll tell ourselves and our comrades
16:03 that we can't conrad our fellow
16:06 americans that we can't tell them this
16:09 because they'll freak out it's another
16:12 way of coveting information
16:15 isn't it interesting that you know no
16:17 matter what you want to believe
16:20 you know that the sightings of ufos and
16:22 the sightings of
16:24 bigfoot feel and match each other almost
16:28 identically no matter how choice your
16:31 footage is
16:32 of a ufo or a bigfoot and i get
16:35 you know bigfoot's funny because there's
16:36 a lot of people dressed up in costumes
16:39 it's always a remote sighting no one can
16:42 ever find it again
16:44 uh you know it and the other thing is
16:46 that within those
16:48 two genres of sightings that excite us
16:53 we have people admitting and getting
16:55 caught that they were faking things
16:58 if it seems outrageous then we're gonna
17:00 have to
17:01 maybe pull back now at the same time i'm
17:03 saying this
17:05 i'm not trying to be a buzz kill for fun
17:08 entertainment
17:09 i love at least ufo sightings
17:13 i really don't like bigfoot sightings
17:15 because they're so badly done
17:18 and when you hear about folks well i'll
17:20 put it this way
17:21 when you usually hear someone talk about
17:24 a ufo sighting
17:26 they're a little worried about the story
17:28 that they're going to have to tell
17:29 around the photograph or on the video or
17:31 whatever
17:32 the sighting now sometimes it's a it's a
17:35 rocket launch
17:36 like spacex putting rockets in space and
17:39 we get to see them here in los angeles
17:41 and they create these amazing plumes
17:42 and there's all there's the side
17:44 boosters and all that kind of stuff
17:46 and so it when that was first occurring
17:49 there was a lot of videos coming out of
17:50 la proper where people were legitimately
17:53 worried about
17:54 what they were seeing in some cases a
17:56 lot of them are just blown away
17:57 a lot of them are super excited the
17:59 alien invasion's coming right
18:01 but people remain fairly skeptical aside
18:04 from the
18:05 handful of ufo abductees right that's a
18:08 little bit different but that's still a
18:09 hoax
18:10 for some you also have your copycat
18:14 groups that come out and try to usurp
18:17 the power of
18:18 perhaps a legitimate sighting to get
18:21 benefit from society to get a story
18:24 now i don't even know how we morally
18:26 would judge anyone
18:28 for creating a great hoax really
18:30 entertaining
18:31 millions if not billions of people with
18:34 their hoax
18:35 they never get caught but that you know
18:37 what
18:39 because they provided entertainment that
18:44 aside from charging perhaps admission to
18:46 hear the story
18:47 whether it be a movie an appearance
18:51 whether you're doing harm like we always
18:53 like to say
18:54 i'm not so sure i'm not so sure if
18:57 hillbilly tells you that
18:59 bigfoot existed what's the the
19:01 hillbillies i can't remember which state
19:02 they were in but they
19:04 said they had bigfoot in a freezer they
19:06 had caught one and they put it in a
19:07 freezer
19:08 and they were taking all these cryptic
19:09 pictures of it because ice had grown on
19:11 top of this thing
19:13 we all it went on for months and months
19:15 i probably found it maybe a couple of
19:17 months into its report
19:20 thanks to the internet and the funny
19:22 thing was
19:24 you looked at the photographs and you
19:26 think you know depending on how astute
19:28 you are with hollywood props or
19:30 or you look back in time for costume
19:34 designs you're pretty certain you're
19:38 seeing a costume
19:40 so but they can get away with it because
19:42 they're hiding it
19:44 they don't want anyone to take it from
19:46 them i mean all these excuses why
19:47 perhaps a
19:49 shady tree anthropologist would be
19:51 protecting what they have right
19:55 but the hilarious thing was that the
19:56 cops finally said
19:59 wait a minute what if this is a human
20:01 body
20:02 that's decayed and someone's got their
20:06 wife in a freezer because uh
20:10 is the only way they can do it now
20:12 they've covered up the story by making
20:14 it sound like
20:15 he or she whatever this thing could have
20:17 been
20:18 was a person in a freezer and so the
20:20 cops demanded to see it and of course
20:22 these guys coughed it up that it was
20:24 indeed a halloween costume
20:25 that they had just simply thrown in a
20:27 freezer you know so
20:29 didn't hurt anybody they entertained a
20:31 lot of folks
20:32 for those who are probably you know
20:35 really trying to prove that bigfoot
20:37 exists i'm sure
20:38 in their mind there's harm being done to
20:40 the credibility of their movement
20:42 i think never being able to find one
20:43 when you want one
20:45 is pretty bad on your credibility you
20:47 got billionaires
20:48 literally dozens of billionaires who
20:50 over time have either
20:54 cashed out of their company and said i'm
20:56 gonna go find ufos or the cash other
20:58 company and said i'm gonna go find
20:59 bigfoot
21:01 and they'll rent planes with infrared
21:03 and they fly over all the regions of
21:05 america where these things are supposed
21:06 to be and they never find anything
21:10 so i can see them being upset what other
21:13 type of hoax archetypes are out there
21:16 and hopefully while you're hearing this
21:18 you're reevaluating
21:20 perhaps things that you have been told
21:22 and again if you determine that
21:23 something is a hoax that you previously
21:25 thought was true but it brought you
21:27 joy brought you happiness yeah
21:30 just chalk it up that you're growing up
21:33 and now you can see
21:34 the magic trick and how it's done but
21:37 you know if if you had a buddy
21:40 like like i've had magician friends
21:43 and they um they do a trick and for
21:47 many performances you are in the
21:49 audience and even though you've seen it
21:51 several times and you keep looking
21:53 and you get little indicators of things
21:54 but you don't even you don't understand
21:55 what those little indicators are like
21:57 they do would
21:58 reach in his back pocket but he's got
21:59 you're looking at his left hand
22:01 but you see it on the fourth try fourth
22:03 attempt or fourth performance i guess
22:05 you could say
22:06 yeah something's going on without a hand
22:08 i don't know what it is so you kind of
22:09 get it but now let's see your buddy
22:11 finally tells you how it works because
22:14 perhaps you're going to assist on stage
22:17 and so you think man i want to know how
22:18 this works because
22:20 then the magic and the feeling of that
22:22 reward will go away
22:24 but every single night he performs that
22:27 or she performs that
22:29 you notice the audiences where you were
22:33 the whole audience and they're having a
22:35 blast
22:37 and now you shift your positive
22:40 endorphin feedback your dopamine
22:44 feedback
22:45 now is triggered off the audience's
22:46 performance
22:48 and the the magic and discipline and
22:51 talent of your friend
22:52 is even higher for one particular reason
22:55 in general
22:56 they are able to recreate this event
23:00 without mistake every single time
23:05 my buddy jeffrey bornstein
23:10 he used to be known as jeffrey steele he
23:11 does a trick in a nightclub where he has
23:14 a woman come up and give him
23:16 their wedding ring and he has a trick
23:18 where
23:20 he manages to hold the ring in his hand
23:23 and then he ends up snapping his fingers
23:27 as part of his thing i think that's the
23:28 way it works and he
23:31 shoots the ring like a wedding ring with
23:33 diamonds on it and stuff
23:35 clear into the like into the floor and
23:37 underneath everybody
23:39 who's uh watching the show and
23:43 they kind of oh oh man sorry well don't
23:46 worry about that
23:46 we'll get it back you know and of course
23:49 intelligent people
23:50 laugh and they're like oh my god that
23:52 can't be in my ring that just can't be
23:53 right he would have never done that and
23:54 blown it off
23:55 so let's keep going with this trick
23:57 right and he eventually
23:59 pulls out a wallet that is completely
24:01 sealed
24:02 two or three different compartments and
24:04 on a key chain inside the wallet
24:06 is this woman's ring but you've been
24:08 looking at the guy the whole time
24:11 and i've seen this trick done so many
24:12 times it's crazy now theoretically i
24:14 know how he does it
24:16 but obviously at some point really early
24:19 in the trick while everyone's watching
24:22 as soon as the woman gives them a ring
24:24 he has
24:25 switched that thing in his hand to a
24:26 dummy
24:28 now two things are occurring he has to
24:30 react to dropping someone's ring
24:32 as if it is a total mistake and he pulls
24:36 it off
24:36 every single time his voice inflection
24:39 his
24:40 expression on his face he's also kind of
24:42 got this dopey
24:43 character he plays on top of it to make
24:45 it even more believable this guy is just
24:47 bad at magic
24:48 right no one's ever chased the ring
24:50 underneath
24:51 the chairs ever you know sometimes you
24:55 might flip it and it might
24:56 you know land in somebody's lap and
24:58 someone goes oh here you go and it's a
24:59 different ring and it would have blown
25:00 the trick
25:01 that has never happened to my knowledge
25:03 it's so convincing that under two
25:05 different occasions
25:07 women attacked him punched him in the
25:09 face once
25:10 but he's a stunt man so before he was a
25:13 magician so no big deal for him man
25:16 sylvester stallone cracked him in
25:19 in the head once on a bus and literally
25:22 broke his nose
25:24 but he's also a marine so no problem
25:26 with that he just goes on and on
25:28 but do you ever get the idea or the
25:31 feeling
25:32 that we don't really want to figure any
25:34 of this stuff out
25:36 that we want to keep a little bit of
25:37 magic in our heart as much as
25:39 the internet's trying to tear it apart
25:43 i think most of you understand that you
25:46 there's a
25:46 couple channels if not probably ten
25:48 dozen channels on youtube
25:50 where magicians are telling you how
25:52 tricks work
25:53 there used to be that show on tv where
25:55 the guy wear the mask and tell you how
25:56 tricks work
25:57 everyone's trying to figure out who that
25:58 guy was in los angeles that was a legit
26:01 show
26:02 i mean people wanted to take him out man
26:04 because he was ruining
26:06 one magic trick sorry one magic show
26:09 after another in vegas and around the
26:11 world
26:12 now fortunately people who like magic
26:15 will always go back to the show and they
26:17 won't watch those shows because they
26:19 don't want to be told that it doesn't
26:20 exist
26:21 or that these things are not real magic
26:23 sorry
26:24 and i think that's the way that people
26:26 metabolize ufos
26:28 bigfoots religion
26:32 they just go you know you know i'm okay
26:34 i there's no law that says i have to
26:36 yet believe what you believe
26:40 so i you know i find this entertaining
26:41 i'm not gonna mess with people who read
26:43 tarot cards
26:44 because i like that i like people
26:46 reading my palm
26:48 i like it i like astrology i like
26:50 numerology for whatever reason it clicks
26:53 with your soul
26:54 it is a bright moment in your day it's a
26:56 little bit entertainment right
26:58 one of the funny things i used to do is
26:59 uh
27:01 when you get a newspaper with horoscopes
27:03 in it
27:04 based on the uh zodiac signs
27:08 i'd read the wrong one to somebody what
27:10 are you oh you're a pisces and i'd read
27:12 them taurus
27:13 and they'd be like oh my god that's so
27:14 me it was like oh
27:17 yeah it's crazy right crazy how accurate
27:19 that is
27:20 because they wanted to believe it and
27:24 you know out of a paragraph of
27:25 attributes that supposedly describes
27:27 your astral
27:28 personality very accurate
27:33 to some people now i'm a virgo
27:37 and virgos are always said to be very
27:40 meticulous
27:42 creative people and just it usually
27:45 sounds just like me
27:47 incredible incredible how that works
27:51 but i know plenty of people that are
27:52 born the same day i was born
27:55 who have not a single lick of that
27:59 of those attributes and they have other
28:02 very positive attributes that probably
28:03 match
28:04 other signs but okay
28:07 yeah it's my reality right it's my
28:09 consensus
28:10 for my sphere of influence it's
28:12 interesting
28:13 what else do we know about the
28:15 archetypes of hoaxes and and
28:17 what other attributes affect the
28:18 composition of a hoax
28:22 some of you might have read in history
28:24 that there were
28:26 i guess you could say junior astronomers
28:29 if if not
28:30 for the time expert astronomers who had
28:33 figured out
28:34 the calculation and gps location on
28:37 earth
28:39 of where the next solar eclipse was
28:41 going to occur
28:43 and they would track the sun i mean this
28:46 must have been
28:48 thousands of years of a particular
28:50 family
28:51 tracking this such that the algorithm
28:53 popped out or some undocumented someone
28:54 kept
28:55 grabbing the documentation moving it
28:57 forward in time
28:59 but the second that they realized that a
29:02 solar eclipse was going to occur by a
29:04 kingdom
29:04 with a king or a queen they would
29:09 nut up huge grab their gear
29:13 and go to the castle
29:16 or whatever and they would usually
29:20 compose some sort of threat
29:23 it varied over time
29:26 they might say that your crops won't
29:27 grow if you don't you know i'm going to
29:30 shut off the sun if you don't give me
29:31 money
29:32 and if without the sun during the day
29:35 then none of your crops are going to
29:36 grow yeah because in eclipse during the
29:38 day a full one
29:40 and you don't know anything about any
29:42 theory of anything
29:44 it's gonna be dramatic for your
29:46 consciousness
29:48 still happens to this day
29:51 so here comes the eclipse it starts
29:53 occurring the king has
29:55 told this guy to go screw himself
29:59 and it starts eclipsing and the king
30:01 panics
30:03 and says give him whatever he wants just
30:05 bring back the sun
30:06 sure enough it's going to be a natural
30:08 process anyway
30:10 and you imagine you imagine what that
30:11 event really looked like it would be a
30:13 funny mel brooks movie
30:15 history of the world part two or
30:16 something where the guy is like yeah you
30:19 know because he knows it's gonna take a
30:20 few minutes for that thing to
30:22 crest and get out of the way of course
30:24 with just a minor amount of the sun
30:25 fully exposed
30:27 it does light up the day pretty good but
30:30 he's got to fiddle with time
30:32 because you know it's going to take a
30:34 little while well you know okay well you
30:35 know
30:36 your guy just tell your king you better
30:37 not ever do that again you know whatever
30:39 it is right
30:40 okay yeah sure sure whatever just bring
30:42 back the sun
30:43 well you know come to think about it now
30:45 maybe i don't want to do that it just
30:46 keeps delaying it out
30:49 and the guy's trying to broker
30:50 everything in the last second
30:52 give me that horse give me that give me
30:54 your daughter or whatever and he's just
30:55 putting a bunch of stuff on the barbie
30:58 then a ufo shows up and blocks the sun
31:00 and the guy gets his head cut off then
31:02 the ufo goes home
31:03 the printing press and the ability to
31:05 record facts in and around
31:06 an event has greatly impacted
31:10 the archetype of a hoax hasn't it
31:13 like i said religions were able to form
31:16 in mass prior to the printing press
31:20 if sub it has has anything to do with it
31:23 from our previous episode
31:25 then the printing press was a mechanism
31:27 to project into the
31:28 consciousness of man once you manifest
31:31 into this
31:32 reality what is and what isn't
31:35 thus taking control back literally
31:38 from the gods themselves because before
31:41 that
31:42 you were able to contact your gods
31:44 because you weren't sanctioned
31:46 by other people's writings so
31:48 photography comes around
31:51 and it kills the folk tale in a large
31:55 part
31:56 you uh especially when cameras hit i
32:00 guess like pocket camera level stuff
32:01 really small
32:02 cameras you had easy facilities to go
32:05 get them developed
32:06 it was a little more expensive back in
32:08 the night you had to buy a roll of film
32:11 and it took time to load the camera and
32:13 to
32:14 snap it and then [ __ ] it again and roll
32:16 it up and do it again
32:18 so if a ufo was doing a lot of crazy
32:19 stuff super fast you wouldn't
32:21 necessarily have the ability to record
32:23 that as a layman
32:26 but then the 20th century comes around
32:28 and we have
32:29 eight millimeter cameras but still
32:32 you have to have the camera loaded ready
32:34 to go
32:35 and you have to be all in the right
32:37 place so you be in your backyard
32:39 in 1955 even though you own an eight
32:41 millimeter camera internally
32:43 with plenty of film in the refrigerator
32:45 or whatever
32:46 you're stuck between a rock and a hard
32:48 place if you're staring at a ufo
32:50 or more than one or an alien right in
32:52 front of your face a being at no point
32:56 can you
32:57 say probably in your rational mind
33:00 okay just wait there i'll be right back
33:03 meet me
33:04 how does this work again you know
33:07 you'd have to be a serendipitous thing
33:09 where you have this camera rolling
33:10 you're filming your backyard with your
33:11 kids
33:12 and then all of a sudden it flies over
33:14 your kid's head and you grab a shot
33:16 the camera's advanced tremendously in
33:18 the 80s
33:21 now it runs on tape
33:24 much longer play time much longer record
33:26 time
33:27 quality is a little higher it's color
33:29 now
33:31 it still suffers greatly you look at
33:32 those old
33:34 video camera shots and even though it
33:36 was remarkable to have
33:38 consumer video today it's awful
33:41 but now your cell phone has 4k cameras
33:44 in it
33:44 front and back no excuse you see
33:47 something
33:48 everybody's got their phone on them
33:49 don't they
33:51 if you don't the guy your girl standing
33:53 next to you does
33:55 it changes the game your credibility
34:00 has to enhance tremendously the
34:03 chubacabra right
34:05 this phantom animal from the south that
34:07 lives in south america
34:10 well i've got friends of mine who are
34:14 even younger than me that believe that
34:15 those are real
34:17 they'll have stories about animals on
34:19 the rooftops and they
34:21 told me romantically that they thought
34:22 it was the chubacabra
34:24 and you know this house right here has
34:26 raccoons
34:27 the size of your dog running around
34:29 we've got possums up there
34:31 they crawl across the tree go across
34:33 this this awning thing i've got and then
34:35 jump on the roof
34:37 and it sounds crazy it sounds like you
34:39 got a human being up there on all fours
34:41 sometimes like uh
34:43 the precious guy right gollum
34:48 the evil one so if you're passing
34:52 a word of mouth around your
34:55 requirements for the story are
34:58 less if you are a very credible person
35:01 in your village
35:02 then whatever you say is typically
35:04 believed but now
35:06 here's a macabre truth about hoaxes
35:11 let me let me i mean this will surprise
35:14 some of you
35:15 you'll be like oh my god i never really
35:17 thought about this and others
35:19 you're gonna be like yeah yeah it's
35:20 george carlin's old joke
35:22 which we're gonna say here
35:25 george carlin once said you know he
35:28 thought that nascar
35:29 and racing in general was the dumbest
35:31 thing in the world driving a car in a
35:32 circle
35:34 he says i only watch those shows for the
35:36 crashes i want to see
35:39 fireballs and death and he goes that's
35:41 why i watch him
35:42 and he's joking now if you're in the
35:46 racing business is probably not as funny
35:49 if you ever study formula one racing
35:52 and study how many people died there's
35:53 compilation videos of all the people who
35:55 died racing
35:58 there was a point when a wreck equaled a
36:00 death
36:01 and then there was a point where a wreck
36:03 was just an inconvenience which is
36:05 hopefully where we are now there's a
36:07 couple exceptions to the rule
36:10 but no one wants to admit it but the
36:13 truth of the matter is
36:16 you get dopamine drops when you see
36:18 those things
36:20 we all know about the day in september
36:22 11th right
36:24 horrific amazing groundbreaking day
36:28 of destruction
36:32 and i remember watching those towers
36:36 explode and fall to the ground
36:40 now a big chunk of my brain is going oh
36:42 my god
36:44 like i'm processing all of i all that i
36:47 can
36:48 with my mind at the time which was
36:49 completely shut down and asleep
36:52 i'm thinking about life's being lost i'm
36:54 thinking about america being attacked
36:56 and thinking about
36:57 just the mess that it just created
36:59 downtown and how fast that's going to
37:01 ever
37:02 get cleaned up but doesn't that go for
37:05 every single moment like those
37:07 you are watching a car race and there is
37:09 a big giant pile up and
37:12 you get dopamine
37:16 drops during these moments and dopamine
37:18 will never make you feel bad in your
37:20 body
37:20 except for when you go into withdrawal
37:23 of it not being there
37:25 so here we are in the middle of
37:26 realizing something really negative and
37:28 we're getting turned on
37:31 that's in a worst case scenario the only
37:33 reason why i mention that so that you
37:34 can recognize hey
37:36 when hor horrific things happen you turn
37:38 on the tv or whatever back in the day
37:42 there's a hostage situation there's this
37:45 there's that
37:46 you are freaked out a little bit and
37:48 you're also getting the
37:50 you know this stroke in your mind of um
37:54 some sort of positive thing chemical
37:57 chemically
37:57 speaking right now part of it's probably
38:01 your mind trying to pad
38:05 the experience because they realize
38:06 you're in a you know fight-or-flight
38:08 situation
38:09 a little bit so now dial that back to
38:12 all the hoaxes we've been talking about
38:14 plus any other you can think of in your
38:15 mind
38:16 that are typically construed as a
38:17 positive one ufos bigfoot
38:21 theories of lizard people and
38:23 interdimensional lists or that
38:25 you know time travelers it's funny
38:28 the thing about time travelers is that
38:30 you'll there's this big trend once we
38:32 got a lot of photographs online to find
38:34 doppelgangers between people here today
38:36 and photographs of people in the past
38:38 which might even be their relatives
38:41 i haven't really heard anyone suggest a
38:44 time traveling
38:46 thing that has a negative spin to it
38:50 it's always kind of positive and the
38:52 more elaborate they get the more
38:53 positive they get
38:55 where's the the one where the guy said
38:57 he he met himself
38:59 like a park or something like that he
39:00 was much older
39:02 i mean imagine you're a long-lost uncle
39:04 when you realize that your
39:06 your nephew that you never got to meet
39:08 is a spitting image of you
39:10 i mean some crazy younger version of you
39:13 and then you just walk up on him
39:15 and tell him that you're him and unless
39:18 there's a scar
39:20 or something that that person has that
39:22 you don't have
39:23 you'd have to have every mole you'd have
39:25 to have every anomaly
39:27 but some people aren't that smart so you
39:28 can pull a nice scam on them
39:31 so why mention the the endorphin
39:34 dopamine connection because
39:38 it provides a skeletal backbone a
39:41 support mechanism
39:42 for you to continue believing whatever
39:44 is being asserted
39:46 let me give you a fictitious example
39:48 between the two of us
39:50 now i'm pretty sure that if you're over
39:52 like 10 years old
39:54 there's a point where if you were ever
39:56 raised on the story of santa claus
40:00 in western culture especially in america
40:04 he's a big deal over here let's just get
40:06 that clear
40:09 father christmas in other areas right
40:12 what's the theory
40:13 dad the dude's got a crib up in the
40:15 north pole
40:17 supposedly he has a hot wife we've never
40:19 really seen her that much but he's got a
40:21 bunch of these little elf characters
40:23 which just indigenously love creating
40:25 things that's just what they love to do
40:26 like the keebler elves man
40:29 this dude has a periscope
40:32 into your life a magical
40:35 thing like in wizard of oz this ball he
40:37 looks into and he can kind of tell
40:39 whether you've been good or bad this
40:40 last 12 months
40:42 in america i will tell you as whether
40:44 it's a sick
40:46 practice that we're doing or not boy you
40:48 can get your kids to behave towards the
40:50 end of the year
40:51 every single year boy girl doesn't
40:54 matter
40:55 but at some point it gets revealed that
40:58 your parents
41:00 what i told my kid was i said now you're
41:01 santa claus santa claus does exist but
41:04 he's you
41:05 i have a whole episode on santa claus if
41:06 you're interested and the dynamic of
41:09 whether or not it's a good idea to keep
41:11 that alive or not
41:13 but now i find a way
41:16 to either use internet photographs my
41:18 own capabilities or maybe i figure out a
41:21 way to to do this
41:22 thing i'm going to suggest here without
41:24 actually producing any real raw evidence
41:26 of any kind anything could even be
41:27 asserted as real evidence
41:29 maybe i create a backstory but i start
41:33 to suggest
41:34 i mean wouldn't this be funny eric dube
41:35 scam on april 1st or something
41:38 but i start to suggest that this being
41:40 really does exist
41:42 but that there's some sort of belief
41:44 association
41:45 that is required to bring him to you
41:49 at that time of the year it really
41:51 doesn't have anything to do with
41:52 christianity
41:54 hence the south park episode where it's
41:56 jesus against santa
41:58 but i'll tell you this you know
41:59 depending on how cynical you are
42:02 in america and if you're raised here
42:05 especially in the area where we pledge
42:07 the legions to the american flag every
42:08 morning as
42:09 children in school which was just cool
42:13 man i have to say
42:14 these kids have no idea what they the
42:16 benefits they miss from being
42:18 patriotic to their country but if
42:21 someone could
42:22 make it real i mean there's all kinds of
42:24 movies that do this right where
42:26 uh even there's a twilight zone that did
42:28 it
42:30 what is it um ernest saves christmas
42:34 where someone inherits the role of santa
42:36 claus that they
42:38 they absolutely do not believe in santa
42:40 claus it's either for the entire
42:42 story or for half the story
42:45 and then the main character gets put
42:48 into the role of santa claus
42:50 so they go from a non-believer
42:53 to a believer and they're the ones
42:55 passing out the gifts it's like this
42:57 irony it's beautiful
42:59 but if i found a little tiny nugget
43:01 inside your mind
43:02 of something that you would really
43:04 rather believe and not believe
43:07 and i construct just the most minor
43:08 indicators
43:10 that we're actually on to something i
43:13 might get you
43:14 now the santa claus idea might seem
43:17 ridiculous and remedial
43:20 but let me ask you this how many people
43:22 believe in ufo sightings that previously
43:25 did not want to believe that ufos exist
43:29 i'm going to suggest almost no one you
43:32 know one of the greatest
43:33 in this story might be out there if you
43:35 know of one please let me know and of
43:36 course we have to take their word for it
43:38 but it'd be interesting to have a person
43:41 in town and especially a small town
43:43 let's say 10
43:44 000 or less and they're always running
43:46 around
43:47 like saul from the bible persecuting
43:51 people who say that ufos are real
43:54 and they've got decades of this behavior
43:57 and they're just acidic they're bad
43:59 they've done harm
44:01 and then they get abducted and not only
44:03 do they get abducted they get abducted
44:05 in a way that
44:06 they're completely lucid they they get
44:09 one of everything that's ever been
44:11 claimed in an abduction they get anally
44:13 probed they have
44:14 children with aliens they go to foreign
44:16 planets
44:17 whatever they get the whole they get
44:20 levitated up into the bottom of the ship
44:23 and now they come back to their little
44:24 community
44:26 and they don't really know what to do
44:28 right away because they're like oh my
44:30 god
44:30 these people were all right i was an ass
44:33 now i got to figure out a way to find
44:35 the leaders of that organization within
44:37 my community
44:38 apologize profusely tell them my story
44:41 and then try to get acceptance you don't
44:45 usually hear that story you usually hear
44:47 someone who has already had a pretty
44:50 set opinion about them being real
44:53 then they get abducted that's why it was
44:56 interesting when joe brogan was
44:58 interviewing dan aykroyd
45:00 and dad said dan said he was at a
45:02 convention where there's hundreds of
45:03 abductees in this
45:06 this trade center whatever
45:09 and he said of all of you that have been
45:12 abducted
45:13 how many of you would welcome it
45:14 happening again to you
45:17 and he said that only fifty percent of
45:18 the people raise their hands
45:21 i think that's amazing some people
45:23 absolutely hated the experience that
45:25 they had
45:26 now of course the the thing i mentioned
45:28 a really really long time ago and i
45:30 don't remember exactly
45:32 what episode it was but i want to repeat
45:34 it here because i meant to repeat it
45:35 more recently and i forgot there are
45:40 a host of people that said that they had
45:43 their children
45:45 even from their womb stolen from them
45:48 as a result of these abductions
45:52 at the same time we know that the people
45:54 that are rumored today
45:56 to be toying with the very survivability
45:59 of children for their entertainment
46:01 or physical benefit
46:04 see adrenal crumbs that if they wanted
46:07 to go
46:08 and grab kids and they could work with
46:11 your mk ultra people the mk ultra people
46:15 figure out some weird anomaly but you
46:16 know what we do the xyz pdq and these
46:18 people actually
46:19 will believe anything that we tell them
46:21 they will believe that they saw whatever
46:23 we told them to say
46:24 that said they saw you know somewhere in
46:27 there you probably understand me
46:29 and so they construct this scenario the
46:31 subduction scenario
46:34 making them believe it's aliens but it's
46:36 actually somebody
46:37 on these weird groups
46:40 now the thing with bigfoot and
46:43 i i don't know where the very first
46:46 bigfoot story
46:47 came in you it goes back a really long
46:51 time
46:53 almost every boy has had this little
46:56 story happen in their life
46:58 a boy is out hanging out with his
47:00 buddies hanging out maybe with
47:01 even his elders his bigger brothers
47:04 father uncle whatever
47:07 i'm trying to figure out if i've done i
47:08 know i've done this but i can't remember
47:10 exactly
47:11 one scenario off the top of my head
47:14 but what happens is you get freaked out
47:16 by something let's say you're in the
47:18 wilderness
47:19 and a deer a buck
47:22 comes around the corner and scares you
47:26 you scream like a little girl
47:30 and your relatives are like oh my god
47:32 you know this must be a bear
47:34 coming after the kid so let's you know
47:36 they rush in and you're okay
47:39 and then you don't want to say
47:42 that a peaceful deer freaked you out
47:46 and so imagine there's a scenario where
47:49 a kid might say
47:50 or even a grown man it's even probably
47:52 more prevalent as an oak grown man
47:55 yelling and screaming like a little girl
47:57 who's portrayed himself as super tough
47:59 and maybe in most scenarios he is but
48:01 something surprised the crap out of him
48:03 literally and so he constructs the story
48:05 oh
48:06 it was a big yeti and oh my god you
48:08 wouldn't believe how huge this thing is
48:10 oh yeah
48:10 where to go i just ran that way man
48:13 believe me man you don't want to you
48:14 don't want to catch up with it
48:15 well we got a bunch of guns let's go do
48:17 it okay and then you know every broken
48:21 branch
48:22 you know by a bear you know bucks that
48:25 um
48:25 carve their horns on a or they polish
48:27 their horns
48:28 on little trees so they're all damaged
48:31 it's all organic it's all stuff that
48:33 really happens
48:33 now that's a yeti that did it it's a
48:36 bigfoot that did it
48:38 and so but but the story atrophies a bit
48:41 you go back to the
48:42 camp and someone goes yeah you probably
48:44 just got scared by some
48:46 duck or something right no i did not it
48:48 was still a big thing so then that dude
48:50 has got to defend his credibility and he
48:52 starts thinking about it okay what can i
48:54 do here well we track animals right and
48:55 how do we track animals you see hoof
48:57 marks and
48:58 little frog footprints and that's where
49:00 you know those animals are so
49:01 yeah yeah i know the ticket i'll get a
49:04 some
49:05 wood or something and i'll carve myself
49:06 a bigfoot
49:08 foot not knowing the anatomical
49:12 correctness of the whole thing they
49:13 create kind of a funky foot they go
49:16 squashing it around the forest
49:20 give it some time then they bring their
49:22 buddies out
49:23 look at that oh my god look at that as
49:25 time passes
49:27 that starts to get analyzed by experts
49:29 and starts being deemed
49:31 a fake and so the next person pulling
49:33 the hoax understands
49:35 the parameters they got the previous guy
49:37 caught
49:38 and they do more and more research they
49:40 start building
49:41 fake feet out of uh
49:44 like rubber prosthetic rubbers or
49:47 whatever and they put them over their
49:48 own feet
49:50 and now they hop to create a big you
49:53 know
49:54 foot distance
49:57 and it's squishing in like a normal foot
49:59 and so now the the chronology of the
50:01 footprint works
50:02 but much better maybe even had little
50:04 hairs on it and stuff
50:07 by the way i watched the an episode on
50:09 the 1967 one recently on dark five
50:14 and he mentioned a statistic about that
50:17 60
50:18 67 sighting where you see the you know
50:21 the female
50:21 with the breasts you know walking across
50:24 the uh
50:24 don't get excited if you haven't seen it
50:26 it's all hairy hairy suit thing
50:29 but recently people have looked at that
50:31 and said that
50:32 the palms of animals are typically
50:35 always bright
50:36 and this thing had a rubber suit palm
50:40 just the coloring of the body is counter
50:43 to all evolution that exists on planet
50:46 earth and of course you'll get your
50:47 devotees that are like yeah man well
50:50 that's the thing is they didn't evolve
50:52 you know that's why they still exist and
50:53 you're like oh okay
50:55 that mean that way back when you thought
50:57 they stopped evolving
50:59 that this anomaly of skin pigment
51:01 distribution
51:02 was still not the case as it is today
51:05 you know
51:06 but what do we have after all this fun
51:09 talk about a couple different subjects
51:10 that lead into these hoaxes and i'm
51:14 gonna
51:14 steer past the psychotic
51:17 the truly crazy that are reporting all
51:20 kinds of things because
51:22 it's sort of like picking on a drunk guy
51:23 you know these people are
51:25 struggling with their minds we don't
51:28 need to vet them because the problem
51:29 stops at their consciousness
51:32 having routine problems and seeing you
51:34 know if you had someone that was crazy
51:36 that
51:37 you didn't know they were crazy but they
51:39 start reporting to you
51:41 ufo sightings or whatever and then
51:45 you go to their house to sit down and
51:47 talk with them to plan try to get
51:48 more shots of these things because
51:50 perhaps they say they're seeing them all
51:51 the time
51:52 and then you find out that they think
51:53 their toaster's talking to you
51:55 but why aren't you you know you're not
51:58 answering the question they're like what
51:59 a quick question
52:00 well my toaster's asking you a question
52:02 i don't know why you don't hear that you
52:03 know
52:05 i saw a tweet this morning which was
52:07 very interesting
52:08 and the tweet was something to the
52:11 effect it was a total projection of her
52:14 internal mind and it was something to
52:17 the effect of
52:18 big tech is making everyone go insane
52:21 because they can't communicate with each
52:22 other
52:23 no i wouldn't use big tech i would have
52:25 used the crisis
52:26 that causes you to wear a mask that's
52:29 the one that's keeping people away from
52:30 each other making them go crazy
52:33 but this person posts on social media
52:38 i think without without a doubt every 5
52:41 to 15 minutes of her existence from the
52:44 moment she is conscious to the moment
52:46 she goes to sleep
52:48 and so big the threat of that
52:51 almost mental dysfunction that that
52:54 addiction
52:54 to something that is absolutely
52:56 fruitless in her life
52:59 she is feeling suicidal because that is
53:02 being taken away from her
53:03 it's freaking her out and because she
53:07 needs
53:08 and it's funny before this tweet i would
53:09 have thought she was a very mentally
53:11 stable person
53:13 but she is angry of course that all of
53:16 her followers
53:16 are being taken away and we deal with
53:19 that on the show
53:21 for us we're you know we can't get to 5
53:23 000. i got videos that have been watched
53:25 hundreds of thousands of times
53:27 and it still says 33 000 you know but
53:29 the monthly tick on that video is a
53:31 thousand
53:32 our weekly tick on that video is a
53:33 thousand like my moon ones
53:35 i'll get news that they've been watched
53:37 a thousand times the last 28 days
53:39 way back in the day videos still the
53:42 same
53:42 overall number they're lying to you
53:44 they're cheating on you
53:45 but now i don't lose my whole life over
53:47 it i definitely would never commit
53:49 suicide based on my social media
53:51 watching
53:52 you think i just take a break as you're
53:54 all gone but the mind is a gigantic
53:57 punching bag
53:59 in this 21st century it is and you know
54:02 it
54:03 every time you open up sensory input in
54:06 your body
54:08 and allow these scumbags to talk to that
54:11 sensor
54:13 it's tend to amount to
54:17 you know sadist behavior
54:20 i mean you're you're a masochist man you
54:24 love being tortured you love being beat
54:26 up
54:27 and why is that because those
54:32 the dopamine drops in your brain are
54:34 still coming even though you're being
54:36 angered but the other one that's sort of
54:39 sort of an unspoken attribute of these
54:42 situations
54:44 i think it has to do with validation
54:47 we we know that folks need to be
54:53 validated we almost all of us need to be
54:56 validated
54:58 but i'm not sure we completely
54:59 understand the
55:01 minutia of validation i could probably
55:03 do a whole episode on it
55:05 i won't unless i really run dry on
55:07 things
55:09 you personally want confirmation within
55:12 your own mind to
55:13 yourself from yourself that what you are
55:15 thinking and what you have put in the
55:17 true false maybe piles
55:20 at least the true and false ones
55:22 especially that that is a correct
55:23 assessment of that information that
55:25 methodology in your
55:26 brain in your life you need that
55:30 for your own sense of security that
55:33 you're not crazy
55:34 that you're making the right decisions
55:36 because the more right decisions you
55:37 make
55:37 the more right things happen in your
55:39 life so
55:41 there is a level of information or
55:44 i should say a category of information
55:46 by which you can
55:48 self-validate it's an algorithm and a
55:50 math
55:51 problem that you invented that always
55:54 seems to produce
55:55 a productive result that one's easy
55:59 but whether or not ufos exist hard
56:02 to validate without there's an afterlife
56:05 hard to evaluate
56:06 unless you have a spiritual experience
56:09 but even if you have a spiritual
56:10 experience of some sort some paranormal
56:12 experience but you're all by yourself
56:14 there's a bit of a bummer quality too
56:18 the result the the euphoria the eureka
56:21 moment when it occurs to you simply
56:23 because
56:25 there's no one there to validate and to
56:26 prove that you're not crazy
56:28 saying something outrageous i was able
56:31 to um
56:32 on new year's i was with my girlfriend
56:36 that
56:37 was with me at disneyland with the walt
56:39 disney thing right i'm
56:40 sorry for mentioning this a billion
56:41 times i feel like a douche saying this
56:43 over and over
56:45 but we had a mutual friend there for new
56:47 year's
56:49 and we were bouncing around topics and
56:51 and this friend brought up something
56:53 that was very
56:53 really close to that sort of event
56:56 because she was kind of like well you
56:57 know i don't know if i believe in the
56:58 afterlife and stuff so i look over at my
57:00 friend i'm like hey
57:03 let's tell her the story i said i ever
57:05 tell you the story no no
57:06 so i told her the story and i said she
57:08 was there
57:09 and sure enough the whole thing came
57:11 together in a much more profound way for
57:13 our the third
57:14 person in the room because they were
57:15 like oh my god i got two people
57:18 validating this to me both of which i
57:19 trust but it's easy for him to say
57:22 he saw something in his head but to be
57:25 tracked
57:26 through the park to bob gur you know
57:28 with no other diversions because that's
57:30 what i told
57:31 you because i'll tell you look we walk
57:33 directly to the guy
57:35 we only do two rides on the right side
57:37 in tomorrowland which is star tours and
57:38 space mountain
57:40 i didn't even stop at those and i went
57:41 to the kitty area where we never go
57:43 so i'm telling you that story but if the
57:45 person that was with me was right here
57:47 on camera
57:48 saying yeah that's true man that's
57:49 totally true
57:51 then it's going to hit you a little
57:52 harder isn't it
57:55 so that little validation thing if you
57:58 can have a third party
57:59 validate to person the second party
58:02 you're talking to
58:03 it's an amazing thing but there's all
58:07 kinds of subtle validation
58:08 that we can get addicted to i like it
58:12 when the view counts go up on a video
58:14 for at least two reasons
58:17 one if it's information like the moon
58:19 hoax i like people to know that
58:21 information
58:22 i like it i'd like for them to hear it
58:24 for me because i think i've put together
58:25 a pretty good
58:27 repertoire of the things that just don't
58:29 compute
58:30 i've never had a problem even with nasa
58:33 employees
58:33 who are still trying to [ __ ] me to
58:35 my face about the fact that we went
58:37 i'll hit him with my list of things i
58:39 got him on the ground
58:41 in a gracie triangle about to break
58:43 their arm in half
58:44 and they're tapping out in five minutes
58:46 i mean it's never not been the case
58:48 ever ever ever only douchebags online
58:51 hold the line and won't talk to you
58:52 anymore after you break their heart
58:55 i'm not trying to break people's hearts
58:56 just trying to wake people up
58:58 but the second reason that i like to see
59:01 the
59:02 numbers go up and it has nothing to do
59:04 with the first archetype because this
59:05 will be a different species of video
59:07 is that we're having a mutual experience
59:10 one i like to know that some of the
59:12 weird thoughts that i have
59:13 you have so when i get these messages
59:16 which are very common i can't believe
59:18 you just posted this message
59:20 two days ago i was having a conversation
59:22 with friends about this exact esoteric
59:24 topic and sometimes they'll go on and
59:26 they'll say look i was having a problem
59:29 getting anyone to understand what i was
59:31 saying and then i just tuned into your
59:32 video
59:33 two days later and you are you and i are
59:35 on the same
59:36 freaking wavelength every thought that
59:38 you've had i've had
59:40 and you've probably even had some more
59:41 thoughts that i haven't had so
59:43 that's also very gratifying and
59:45 validating that
59:47 well you know i'm not nuts that these
59:49 are actually
59:50 thoughts that human beings have and
59:53 that's why i find most the videos online
59:55 even though they might be entertaining
59:57 and informative
59:58 boring because no one's going into
60:01 anything unless they have a
60:03 source that told them that this is the
60:05 way
60:06 a particular concept works long time ago
60:10 season one i did i think it's like in
60:12 the 80s or so
60:14 just look this up on deep
60:15 thoughtsradio.com if you have any
60:17 interest
60:19 but it's called the unknown that's
60:21 literally the name of the episode just
60:22 look up the word unknown on the website
60:25 what that episode's all about is the
60:27 fact that we
60:29 don't well rewind human beings
60:33 who elevate
60:36 people up to academic status
60:40 academic rock starness like again
60:43 neil degrasse tyson or carl sagan they
60:46 are allowed to
60:49 go into various processes could be a
60:52 math thing could be their stepping on
60:53 shoulders of other skeptics who are
60:55 trying to figure
60:56 something out they're skeptical but
60:57 they're trying to figure out what it is
60:59 and as long as it's abstract away enough
61:01 when carl sagan talks
61:03 everything carl sagan is saying is true
61:05 to some people
61:08 same thing with neil degrasse tyson
61:09 who's whose college education is
61:11 probably going on 40 years now
61:15 okay so what that archetype is teaching
61:19 you
61:20 is that you have to go through these
61:23 individuals just like a church
61:25 you can't get to god by yourself god has
61:27 rigged the whole system so the
61:28 pedophiles are between you
61:30 and him and they have the key jesus gave
61:33 it to the pope right
61:35 and you got to go through these you got
61:37 to sacrifice your children into the
61:39 system
61:39 to save mommy and daddy will you want my
61:41 kid okay i'll just make more
61:43 go ahead you just have that one in the
61:44 basement and help
61:46 they're so abdicated to these people
61:51 that whatever those people tell them is
61:52 the way
61:55 it's the way he said that we have to
61:57 give him our first born okay
61:59 i guess that's the way everybody's doing
62:01 it not thinking for yourself
62:04 so there's a big validation element to
62:07 hoaxes isn't i mean aren't there are
62:10 there situations where people
62:12 will create a story and what they really
62:14 want and you know this is the case today
62:16 more than ever
62:18 the resistance towards human development
62:22 slash do no harm policies of developing
62:25 humanity into societies
62:27 is being interrupted by the
62:29 disenfranchised
62:30 who were made disenfranchised by the
62:33 people that they worship
62:36 but every day that goes by
62:40 as many times as they try to pass you
62:42 know
62:43 [ __ ] gender fluidity crap on us
62:48 it doesn't ever really work so you're
62:51 like oh you're dis-franchised though
62:53 okay so um you know what we're gonna do
62:56 for you
62:57 what we're gonna we're gonna take your
62:59 mental illness that you've got that you
63:01 think you're a
63:02 teenage ninja turtle we're going to make
63:04 it law that everyone has to call you a
63:06 teenage ninja turtle is that going to
63:07 make you
63:07 does that sound good yes thank you so
63:10 much my stockholm syndrome controller
63:13 and so then that crazy thing gets passed
63:17 let's say that they're successful in
63:19 convincing the world to go along with
63:20 that insanity
63:23 but it doesn't really benefit the person
63:24 at all does it
63:26 it's not good enough well yeah in case
63:28 they call me ninja turtle
63:30 i'm still a loser i still have an
63:31 education don't even trade skills
63:34 i'm weird i think my toaster's talking
63:36 to you
63:38 i need something else i need something
63:39 else need something else need something
63:40 else because all this is all fluff all
63:43 this is crap
63:45 and so then you get people to say look
63:47 at me look at me look at me i need this
63:49 i need this i need this
63:51 now some people are just charlatans
63:54 who charge money for everything that's
63:56 supernatural that they have this natural
63:58 ability they have they charge money for
63:59 it
64:01 yeah you could you could conceive the
64:02 scenarios where
64:05 let's say john edwards was real and he
64:07 could really talk to the dead
64:10 now after looking at james randy's
64:11 analysis of that situation i no longer
64:13 think that guy's even real
64:16 but people want to hear things as prince
64:18 said and under the cherry boon
64:20 i just think if you tell people what
64:22 they want to hear they make it happen
64:24 when he was holding a box of tarot cards
64:28 he's right i'm sure he's plagiarizing
64:31 someone else with that statement
64:34 he's right so you want to believe in
64:36 ufos
64:38 and you got a person you found online
64:40 who maybe you live in a metropolitan
64:42 area and they're in chicago they're in
64:44 la they're in new york
64:45 you can go see them go see them speak
64:47 you want someone to convince you that
64:49 this is real
64:52 and so it's entertainment on one level
64:55 but if you take it beyond entertainment
64:58 it could end up being a very destructive
65:01 thing
65:02 now i think again one should explore all
65:05 things
65:05 and again it's very difficult to prove a
65:09 negative
65:09 i've been told you can't do it if
65:12 someone claims to have seen a ufo
65:16 and taken a picture or whatever but
65:19 let's say at least they said they claim
65:20 to see one but they have no evidence
65:22 besides their elaborate story
65:25 you can't prove they didn't see it
65:27 unless they said this photo
65:29 is exactly what i saw this is the exact
65:31 moment recorded
65:33 and eventually you see the strings you
65:34 find the halloween
65:36 costume or the toy that matches exactly
65:38 what they took a picture of
65:40 i forgot the gentleman's name someone
65:42 mentions this one to me and i love it
65:45 i don't think i could do a whole episode
65:47 on it but i'll see if i can't figure out
65:48 a way to get into some of this stuff
65:50 but this is sort of on topic which is um
65:53 and again one of you commented i
65:55 apologize for not having on hand right
65:57 at the waterway
65:58 but there was a gentleman who said he
65:59 went into a time machine
66:01 and went back to the dinosaur days and
66:04 he brought back a picture of a
66:05 pterodactyl
66:07 which even a paleontologist would say
66:11 okay well that one's probably not
66:13 probably doesn't really look like that
66:14 even if they did exist which i don't
66:16 think dinosaurs
66:18 ever existed unless you want to call a
66:20 saber tooth a dinosaur
66:22 or a woolly mammoth a dinosaur then
66:25 dinosaurs exist but tyrannosaurus rex
66:29 brontosauruses pterodactyls it's all
66:31 crap
66:32 but he brings back what he says is a
66:33 photograph and it's a fairly
66:35 it's a fairly good representation of a
66:38 pterodactyl and a photograph
66:40 now of course he's got two things going
66:43 against him this dude who came up with
66:44 this hoax but then there was a third
66:46 reveal which is beautiful i'll find this
66:48 and put it in the um
66:50 in the video as a picture i'll put the
66:52 guy's name up there too
66:54 well one he said he somehow got access
66:58 to a time machine
67:01 all right well there's your first hoaxer
67:03 rooney
67:05 but someone was looking at this
67:06 pterodactyl and was like you know that
67:07 looks familiar to me that looks really
67:09 oh my god
67:11 and i think it's a children's book where
67:14 in the i think at the upper right-hand
67:16 corner
67:17 this pterodactyl was drawn in this
67:19 children's book about dinosaurs
67:21 and the guy merely took a really
67:25 crappy photograph of the book a little
67:27 bit a little bit out of focus
67:29 and submit it as the real thing and when
67:31 they overlaid it in modern times
67:33 boom the guys busted it's all a lie
67:36 but how long did it take for people to
67:39 figure that out
67:40 and how many people sat next to this
67:42 person thinking
67:44 oh my god you went back in time and you
67:47 validated dinosaurs for me
67:50 there's two support mechanisms to the
67:53 story
67:54 for the people that want to believe
67:57 people who want to believe that time
67:58 travel is possible they're on board
68:02 i mean imagine like you know you just
68:04 play out scenarios between husband and
68:05 wife
68:06 talking and one of them's like time
68:09 machine time travel is not possible
68:10 time doesn't really exist just an
68:12 illusion because you can remember
68:13 history pop up on the other person's
68:15 like
68:15 no man it exists it totally exists man
68:19 i just knew it then dinosaurs
68:22 other support mechanism people want to
68:24 believe in dinosaurs
68:26 i mean they get pissed dinosaurs not
68:29 being real and the moon hoax
68:31 the moon missions being a hoax it's
68:33 almost the same sort of
68:34 weird visceral
68:38 almost attack mode personality you get
68:40 out of someone if wants to believe
68:42 either one of those things are true man
68:43 we got the bones what are you talking
68:45 about
68:45 bones hey do you know all the bones are
68:47 fake they'll even tell you at museums
68:49 that you're not staring at the real
68:50 bones yeah well screw you
68:53 you know paleontologists that have been
68:54 in the business for 35 years who were
68:56 told eventually
68:57 they're going to hit a senior level
69:00 within paleontology
69:01 and they're going to be allowed to go
69:02 into the vaults that are all over the
69:04 world supposedly with all these
69:06 bones now do you find an old big femur
69:09 bone from a mammoth
69:10 sure can you put it together to make it
69:12 look like a
69:13 chickasaurus absolutely can you even
69:17 grind down
69:18 bone matter boil it turn it into a goo
69:20 and pour it into a mold
69:22 yes you can and that mold could then be
69:25 used to put sedimentary rock in there
69:29 can't carbonate rock boom you got a
69:31 foundation for a hoax
69:34 we will more often tell
69:38 our family members and our friends that
69:41 the world is run through conspiracy
69:44 then we will say the world is run
69:46 through hoax
69:48 but that's true the conspiracies today
69:52 are to create false truths which
69:56 are what hoaxes are
70:00 but they put inside the hoax
70:04 a scaffolding of support mechanisms like
70:07 i-beams
70:08 of things that you want to believe
70:11 they want to believe that a world leader
70:14 who's never done anything racist
70:16 in his life is a racist the guy is
70:19 already way richer than you'll ever be
70:21 so you hate him or you love him if
70:23 you're an entrepreneur
70:24 you find the good parts of the person
70:26 and you take those and put them in your
70:28 own practices to try and get
70:29 well more wealthy and more successful
70:31 and again you could take a mechanism
70:33 that made someone rich
70:34 and you don't use it to create monetary
70:37 value you use it to create
70:39 happiness to achieve your goals
70:42 a simple lesson in perseverance will
70:45 furnish either one of those
70:47 outcomes but some people
70:50 can't let others have what they want
70:55 and it just to push the point a little
70:57 bit further
71:00 i'm gonna retell the story i told a few
71:02 episodes back
71:03 just to show you how early this little
71:06 mental defection and the mind
71:10 i should say defect but uh his cells are
71:13 defecting also inside of his brain
71:16 but my cousin he was around my age
71:21 when he was four years old he got to
71:24 come over to my house maybe he was five
71:26 technically
71:27 and he came into my bedroom because the
71:30 parents were like we're gonna watch tv
71:31 you go in the bedroom and play
71:33 and he stood on my bed grabbed every
71:36 single one of my toys
71:37 and was slamming them into the ground on
71:39 a hardwood floor
71:41 at no later no older than five years old
71:44 attempting to break them
71:46 because in his mind i had toys that he
71:49 didn't have
71:50 or even if he did have it he didn't want
71:52 anyone else to have any fun
71:54 and this was a defect at the age of five
71:57 in his mind
72:00 he's no different today he is no
72:02 different today
72:03 if you befriended this guy he would try
72:06 when you least expected to hide in the
72:09 shadows
72:10 and destroy what you have whether it be
72:13 your marriage
72:14 whether it be your property and
72:17 he will play stupid as soon as you
72:20 report that something happened
72:22 he will literally go out of his way
72:26 to destroy you he's just a piece of [ __ ]
72:28 human being but he somehow
72:30 was born with some inbred gene
72:34 or something which resulted in uh
72:40 this bad child
72:43 so it can it can form itself extremely
72:46 early in the process of man
72:48 and we have to assume that it can form
72:50 very slowly over the process of a man
72:54 look at all of the age brackets of
72:55 people showing up to the stuff that's
72:57 happening in the united states
73:00 the age bracket is usually pretty damn
73:03 young
73:05 older people are busy they're successful
73:08 they got to pay bills they don't want to
73:10 have any of their personal opinions
73:11 spill over into their other professional
73:13 opinion professional
73:14 associates potentially get them
73:17 earmarked as being crazy or
73:19 you know a weird human being now what's
73:22 fun about
73:23 today is that they've the extremists
73:25 have been fed that they're the majority
73:28 and so they're the cockroaches that keep
73:30 coming into the light all the time
73:32 thinking that it's safe to come out and
73:34 now they're being exposed
73:36 the last thing you want in your life and
73:39 of course they have the opinion about
73:40 you too
73:41 if you're opposite than them they try to
73:43 tell stories to themselves that you're
73:45 mentally defect
73:46 defective because you're saying the
73:48 emperor has no clothes on
73:51 they need that to be true but the
73:53 interesting thing is is
73:55 you know if you run a business for
73:56 instance and you're
73:58 encouraging well i shouldn't say you are
74:03 trying to evaluate a potential employee
74:05 that once they get employed at your
74:07 company they get a bunch of rights
74:10 to not be fired depending on how your
74:12 your employment contract works which is
74:14 why you always want to create an
74:15 employment contract
74:16 that is a fire at will situation if your
74:19 state or country provides that freedom
74:21 to you
74:23 because as soon as they go bad you need
74:26 to be able to get rid of them
74:28 but there's still stipulations that they
74:30 can pull on you
74:32 to extort money out of you
74:35 again when i was in the silicon valle
74:38 valley area during the entire 90s
74:42 and a couple years into this century i
74:44 watched sexual harassment cases that
74:46 were completely
74:47 [ __ ] some woman wanting to get
74:52 a little bit of free money she never
74:53 worked very hard she saw on a sports
74:56 illustrated calendar and in someone's
74:57 cube
74:58 and tried to literally get a hundred
75:00 thousand dollars out of supposedly being
75:02 damaged by this calendar
75:04 it's something you could buy at the
75:05 local grocery store it was advertised on
75:07 tv
75:08 all the images that are in this calendar
75:10 were shown on television
75:12 but she didn't try to go sue the local
75:14 television she didn't try to sue sports
75:16 illustrated
75:18 you can't do that for playboy or hustler
75:20 and just show the inside center folds
75:22 and go this is what you're gonna get if
75:23 you send us 9.99
75:24 you can't do that can you because that's
75:28 explicit material
75:30 but a calendar was not deemed explicit
75:33 she simply saw a younger body probably
75:36 someone who's either genetically
75:37 predispositioned have a beautiful shape
75:39 but also probably goes to the gym
75:41 probably doesn't eat crappy food
75:43 and there was a jealous envelope
75:45 jealousy envelope there how dare you
75:46 show me someone that reminds me of what
75:48 i'd really rather be
75:51 you know it's it's almost and when you
75:53 think about like
75:54 let's say you go to a gym and you use
75:58 the showers
75:59 because you don't want to go to work all
76:00 sweaty so you show up in your gym
76:02 clothes you bring your clean clothes you
76:04 show up in your gym outfit you go get
76:06 all sweaty get everyone else's goo all
76:07 over you
76:08 and you go take a shower well dudes are
76:10 walking around naked with their towels
76:12 on no one's going oh my god i saw
76:14 someone else's body that was better than
76:16 mine
76:16 i'm suing you because i saw that but
76:18 that was the basis of her case
76:21 the other super common one in the bay
76:24 area was if you weren't
76:25 white and you got fired it was always a
76:29 racial racial thing
76:31 now does that kind of thing happen sure
76:33 does sexual harassment happen oh yeah
76:35 way worse than some stupid calendar on a
76:37 wall
76:38 of my close friends that work with whole
76:42 foods
76:44 she told me the ceo and a bunch of
76:46 people during during her watch which i
76:47 have no idea if those are the same
76:49 people that are in there today
76:51 would just talk about she would recreate
76:53 the conversations in the break room
76:55 or even during meetings
76:58 and apart from i think she even said one
77:01 person exposed themselves that may not
77:02 have been the same location
77:04 but definitely the subject matter being
77:08 discussed in these rooms were like
77:09 beyond
77:11 inappropriate i mean if this was someone
77:15 saying this stuff in front of you your
77:16 wife
77:18 you'd knock their teeth down their
77:20 throat i mean you know weird stuff like
77:22 that so that stuff does happen i don't
77:23 mean to invalidate that but i know
77:25 of a couple cases where people got the
77:29 job came in and worked a couple weeks to
77:31 figure out the play and they actually
77:32 had senior positions well over folks
77:34 that weren't
77:36 um of the same racial group
77:40 so they were in charge they were in
77:41 charge of all the other people and they
77:44 would cease coming to work and see
77:46 completing work when they came to work
77:48 and eventually they got to work for like
77:50 a year at like 120
77:51 000 in 1991 this is one specific case
77:55 that my girlfriend was
77:58 involved in because it was her boss
78:01 and they personally never had any issues
78:04 but when they tried to fire her for a
78:05 lack of productivity
78:07 she went after the
78:10 the racial discrimination thing and they
78:12 finally found out that this woman who'd
78:13 worked at microsoft before
78:16 had not only done the same thing at
78:18 microsoft
78:19 but when someone got the idea to say she
78:21 says she has a comp sci degree from
78:24 washington state or something some some
78:26 college up there
78:27 i don't know which college they went and
78:29 called to college trying to
78:30 validate the degree and they said yeah
78:32 no this person dropped out of school and
78:33 left a year and a half and never got the
78:35 degree
78:36 la la la la la so the hoax
78:40 archetype comes in so many different
78:42 ways
78:44 from the person looking for a little bit
78:45 of attention
78:47 you know one archetype i think is very
78:48 interesting with ufo situations
78:50 has to do with the amount of old
78:56 farmers old dudes and sometimes they
78:59 drag their wives in it
79:01 it's always kind of awkward and the wife
79:02 is dragged in because there's you could
79:03 just tell they're having weird
79:05 conversations
79:07 after they expose the hoax where you can
79:10 see
79:10 the wife's usually not the not ever the
79:14 instigator
79:15 if it's not true and during the
79:18 interviews the guy's like yeah
79:19 this happened then that happened and
79:21 they go to the wife and she's like
79:23 oh my god this is getting worse because
79:26 every lie he tells about our
79:27 mutual experience i have to remember
79:29 what he said
79:32 he may not have any problem remembering
79:33 his life because he does it all the time
79:35 but she may not be
79:36 a liar so she's kind of going inside her
79:38 mind she's like shut up
79:40 like you're up to like 50 things i got
79:42 to remember about our abduction
79:45 now some folks have some pretty good
79:47 radiation burns and a bunch of other
79:49 stuff so something did happen to them i
79:50 don't mean to invalidate the ones that
79:52 are
79:52 real but the amount of like old guys
79:55 that
79:55 again like i said channel aliens like
79:57 dark like this
79:59 yeah yeah volktar from planet there's a
80:01 guy that does that
80:02 for real man he had seen too many sci-fi
80:05 movies but what he was doing is he's in
80:08 his 60s or something
80:10 he's only got you know 10 20 years worth
80:12 of life left who knows for all we know
80:14 he's been diagnosed with stage four
80:16 cancer he's just having a blast on the
80:17 way out go and watch this
80:19 you know and so you're you know
80:22 so there seems to be like a weird age
80:24 bracket where this stuff starts popping
80:26 out of people
80:28 at least in the 20 20th century
80:31 and this episode is not about judging
80:33 people or
80:35 you know saying one person's a bad
80:37 person one person is a good person what
80:39 this is all about is
80:40 hopefully exposing a little bit of the
80:43 metaphysics behind hoax architecture
80:47 and replication and repetition such that
80:50 you can
80:51 hopefully after this episode borrow from
80:55 those old ufo sightings where you think
80:56 maybe
80:57 or they were totally exposed or you
80:59 think it might have been a hoax
81:00 and look at the stuff that's coming out
81:02 of the media today or
81:04 out of a politician's mouth or a
81:06 banker's mouth or
81:08 something that's going to really result
81:10 in you suffering the other
81:14 catch 22 to the whole thing is that you
81:16 can get to a point where
81:19 and i said this i think in my
81:20 conspiracies episode but
81:22 you don't want to get to a point where
81:24 everything in your life is a conspiracy
81:25 right
81:27 and it typically i will just simply tell
81:29 you if you were brand new to anything
81:32 relating to a red pill of any kind
81:36 i would say to you that unless you are
81:39 massively enlightened already
81:42 and doesn't matter what age you are you
81:44 know random stuff wakes you up
81:46 and that's just the law of the land
81:50 but you will most likely go through
81:53 months
81:54 maybe even up to years of your life
81:57 where you're obsessing on everything
81:59 being a conspiracy
82:02 the catch-22 to the catch-22 is
82:05 you may find a really good source
82:09 of red pill information that's already
82:10 been vetted by millions
82:13 it's 10 15 year old data maybe even 50
82:15 to 100 year old data depending on what
82:18 path you're going down the financial
82:20 system
82:21 goes back hundreds and hundreds if not
82:23 thousands of years right jesus turned
82:25 over the money changers in the temple
82:28 it doesn't matter if jesus was real or
82:30 not someone wrote that in the book
82:31 and money changers are who runs their
82:33 world today
82:35 so whoever put that story together knew
82:36 they wanted to create
82:39 a bonafide enemy of the people
82:42 and their savior is turning over their
82:45 tables telling them
82:46 you better change your ways you're not
82:48 going to see the promised land
82:50 then that person becomes further a hero
82:53 never paying attention to the
82:55 fact that during their entire existence
82:58 well during the entire existence of that
83:00 story of that mythos
83:01 those many changes have never lost power
83:04 quite frankly they have
83:06 almost gotten to a point of total
83:08 eclipsing
83:09 of anything that would be construed as
83:10 not in their control
83:12 you want to see as much as you can see
83:17 the minute you will start backing out of
83:19 the
83:20 overload and potentially cease
83:24 seeming crazy to those who are still
83:26 blue pilled
83:28 is the first moment in your life where
83:30 you find something that was pitched to
83:32 you fairly convincingly
83:34 and you yourself without anyone else
83:36 bumping you in the shoulder
83:38 you figure out it it's actually not true
83:41 you're like oh you know i thought that
83:42 was a hoax i thought this but it
83:44 actually isn't one
83:45 it's this this and this and i understand
83:47 how the hoax came about in your brain
83:49 but
83:49 i did my research myself personally and
83:52 and i figured it out
83:53 once you do that then you have to do
83:55 that purge i talk about push everything
83:57 out in the front lawn that you think you
83:59 believe or don't believe
84:00 and re-evaluate it all back into your
84:02 system truth
84:04 false maybe so i hope this is valuable
84:10 it's uh i'll tell you you know there's
84:12 one thing about this show
84:14 show that i'm noticing which is uh
84:17 it's sort of an unfortunate uh
84:20 critical mass problem that that i notice
84:24 in this situation
84:25 let's say this episode is good for you
84:27 to open your mind a little bit
84:29 and you're doing your own associations
84:31 and connections and assessments
84:34 but let's say i have uh out of 570 plus
84:38 videos let's say i've got
84:39 uh 200 that are pretty good at doing
84:41 this to you they're they're open mind
84:43 opening
84:44 again hopefully it's more your dna by
84:47 the time the episode ends than my dna
84:49 and i'm just triggering you to go in
84:51 these directions
84:53 the bummer is is that one
84:57 i think few people go back to old
84:58 episodes but two
85:01 i don't personally have a method too
85:03 easily with the time that i have
85:04 available to do the show and edit the
85:06 show to really
85:07 keep a almost a college-level
85:11 curriculum of these epiphanies
85:14 let's just say they associate with each
85:16 other that's why i try to mention
85:17 episodes that are related to the one
85:19 that i'm on so that you can go
85:22 further down this path if this is
85:24 something that turns you on
85:25 and then it might be that in that
85:26 episode because it's two through three
85:28 years old i'm mentioning
85:30 other episodes that go back even longer
85:32 and that you're able to keep hopping
85:34 back and forth
85:35 the one thing i never have time to do is
85:37 to go into my videos and re-watch them
85:40 in edit mode on youtube and then drop
85:42 the link that
85:43 when i say that video a link comes up
85:46 because i don't find that that's a lot
85:48 that that has much value because you're
85:50 not going to stop watching them when
85:51 you're watching to go watch another
85:52 video that's why that mechanism to me is
85:53 insane
85:54 that's why deepthoughtsradio.com is so
85:56 important
85:58 because the search field is worth
86:00 everything if you're
86:01 interested in a particular subject
86:03 matter and i try to categorize the
86:04 videos but even the categorization
86:08 self-improvement which is where a lot of
86:09 these end up
86:12 or social social is another gigantic
86:14 area that has a lot of these little
86:16 nuggets in there
86:17 it's hard to further qualify it so it's
86:20 easy for you to find a thing because
86:21 we're
86:22 talking about the esoteric being
86:24 analyzed aren't we
86:26 it shouldn't be that way but it is but
86:29 anyway
86:29 on that note if you haven't
86:31 deepthoughtsradio.com please go
86:32 everything on there that you could
86:34 possibly want that i can offer you is
86:36 on there so we have the only thing i
86:39 want to say because there's video audio
86:41 social media the social media
86:42 because of recent events parlor has
86:46 been added back to us i don't think i
86:48 ever took it off but i also
86:50 put back on their gab because
86:53 even though their site is struggling
86:54 horribly right now because of a surge in
86:56 traffic
86:57 if that's where people are going to be
86:58 then that's where we need to be
87:00 uh twitter turned the account on but we
87:02 know everyone's leaving that platform so
87:04 whatever they unlocked our account so i
87:06 put it back up there
87:09 but anyway uh the only other thing
87:11 important is the
87:12 ability to contribute to the show so
87:15 many of you been so generous during
87:17 these really tough times to part with
87:18 the buck
87:19 hopefully i am giving you your value but
87:22 yeah if you haven't
87:24 joined patreon and you want to get the
87:26 episodes potentially 12
87:28 to 24 hours before everyone else that's
87:30 the way you do it
87:32 you get the drop the second that i'm
87:34 uploading it for my computer which
87:35 usually takes about
87:36 i don't know 20 minutes to process so
87:39 you can watch it but
87:40 you can wake up you can be asleep when i
87:43 drop this thing and when you wake up you
87:44 get to watch it 12 hours before everyone
87:46 else get your comments in
87:48 which means i definitely get a a laser
87:50 focused
87:51 response to your comments because you're
87:54 coming in hours early and i still am
87:55 looking at the views of the patreon
87:58 folks before i launch it but hopefully
88:01 you guys are enjoying the uh
88:03 the simultaneous release on all
88:04 platforms too which i'm going to
88:06 continue doing
88:07 to the best of my ability anyway take
88:10 care of yourself and someone else and
88:11 i'll see you on the next deep thoughts
88:13 over now
88:28 [Music]
