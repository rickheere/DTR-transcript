00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts
00:38 on this sort of cold and damp day you
00:43 know it's all about layers now there's
00:46 gonna be a little bit of construction
00:47 sound of background because they're
00:49 adding Arizona they're repaving our main
00:53 road out here and it's the the unit that
00:56 scrapes a little bit off so they can put
00:57 a little more down I even think that the
00:59 steamroller
01:01 towards the end of its cycle I'm not
01:04 sure it might be rolling in there and
01:06 making a weird noise but I don't think
01:08 much will come into the microphone but
01:11 if anything let it be an eerie
01:13 soundtrack to this sort of unfortunate
01:17 subject we have to cover which is the
01:20 border slash the wall alright this will
01:24 be a special report and it's going to be
01:31 what are these subjects I'd rather not
01:33 cover
01:35 it's about this building of the southern
01:37 border wall to the United States of
01:40 America I don't think it's what you
01:43 think it's about
01:45 unless you're fairly woke as they say
01:50 now the main reason why I don't like
01:52 really getting into this is well one
01:54 it's kind of a throwaway episode because
01:56 it's a crisis that we're dealing with
01:58 right now but you know again if I can
02:01 add a perspective to calm people down a
02:03 little bit that I think it's worth it I
02:06 think it's one of those subjects where
02:08 we find a bunch of completely uneducated
02:11 human beings who have done zero research
02:13 know nothing about how the world is
02:16 working currently what the crises really
02:18 are who the villains are they worship
02:20 the villains as a matter of fact almost
02:22 as an imperative again because they
02:24 don't do any research into who they
02:26 worship you know you're Robert De Niro's
02:29 they hang out with the spirit cooking
02:30 ladies you know just just a touch off a
02:34 little bit on that the border in my
02:38 opinion has nothing to do with anything
02:42 that is being communicated to the public
02:45 at all
02:47 I think there are two factors one is way
02:51 more important than the other and then
02:55 there's the propaganda right what's
02:59 going on in America right now what we
03:02 are seeing in America according to my
03:07 belief systems and my knowledge of
03:11 revised history having spent the last
03:14 easily 15 years researching this and I
03:19 mean researching it not only from
03:22 watching stuff on the internet but
03:24 talking to very significant people on
03:27 the ground and almost having dozens and
03:32 dozens of people come into my circle but
03:37 I didn't ask for that started talking
03:40 and some of us just I mean gosh I try to
03:45 I want to try to give you a perspective
03:47 of how random some of this [ __ ] is in
03:51 case some of you're like yeah they
03:52 planted people in your life and you
03:54 bumped into them and maybe I don't know
03:56 I seriously doubt anyone knows I exist
03:58 but but NASA does oh I flatter myself I
04:03 was involved with a short film and as a
04:09 part of this short film they were able
04:11 to get a 1970s / 80s sitcom actor a very
04:17 famous person very famous back in that
04:20 day anyone my age if you say this
04:22 character's name everybody knows exactly
04:25 what show he came from and all this
04:27 other stuff but we're filming in one
04:30 room and walk it to the other room which
04:34 is like a boardroom where they had to
04:40 film at a place where a politician was
04:43 up it was a political based government
04:46 building I believe was the mayor who was
04:49 there but anyway there were using like
04:52 conference rooms as green rooms and that
04:54 kind of stuff and wandering to do the
04:56 casting you know the ad called say you
04:59 know you're
05:00 you're up and look down and they are
05:04 reviewing daniel estulin x' book on the
05:06 bilderbergs a mayor a top actor all
05:12 looking at this book and discussing it
05:14 and of course they assume that we don't
05:17 know what that is because we're just
05:19 some doof balls filming some comedy i
05:22 said oh would you you know what are you
05:26 what are you looking at there oh it's
05:28 just a book about the bilderbergs you
05:31 wouldn't know anything about that and of
05:35 course the smile comes across your face
05:36 you like well we don't need to have that
05:39 conversation right now because you need
05:40 to get in front of the camera but
05:42 interesting how you find out who knows a
05:46 lot about how the government works about
05:49 how the world works these head heading
05:51 agencies called the bilderbergs that
05:52 find your leaders since 1954 the
05:56 bilderbergs have have developed an
05:59 agency that will find the leaders of any
06:04 significance if there is a if there was
06:06 a mayor which you know they don't really
06:08 do much besides cut ribbons in a lot of
06:09 cases and on big cities they do a lot
06:11 more let's just say they need to turn
06:17 chicago into some hellhole well though
06:20 grab some silly dude insert him he makes
06:26 a bunch of local ordinances that violate
06:29 the constitution in the united states
06:30 president united states does [ __ ] all
06:33 about it because he's also hired by them
06:36 no one's protesting overseas because all
06:39 their leaders are also found by this
06:40 agency it creates a congruent plan for
06:44 the world
06:46 my problem is crazy owns the plan
06:50 psychopathic you know killers own the
06:54 plan and so it's never in our best
06:57 interests to allow these things to occur
07:00 regardless of what your souls right so
07:03 america for several decades now I'm
07:06 always like to say it's like since the
07:09 death of JFK all the presidents
07:13 have been selected and they have cooed
07:17 against this country for either personal
07:19 gain meaning money or you know I think
07:25 Jimmy Carter was a very straight shooter
07:28 I think he was literally placed there to
07:30 ensure that the Republican Party got the
07:33 nomination after him that it would it
07:36 would pan out in the history books right
07:37 we talked about him getting screwed all
07:39 the time fake oil embargo not fake
07:43 hostage situation but definitely hostage
07:45 situation which was very orchestrated by
07:49 the forces of the world and maybe maybe
07:51 it was an organic arrest at the very
07:53 beginning I think it was like 215 folks
07:56 that were detained for a little over a
07:59 year but the length of the detainment
08:03 and the blaming of the president United
08:06 States was largely orchestrated okay but
08:12 you have the bush dynasty runs this
08:15 country for let's see one two three four
08:18 five five five terms you thinking no no
08:23 it's only three terms the father got one
08:25 and the son got two well the father
08:28 definitely was running the country while
08:30 Reagan was in office as much as he tried
08:33 to run the country they either shot him
08:36 or staged something that was definitely
08:40 going to teach him that an assassination
08:42 attempt is always possible and he gets
08:46 away right he survives but it's all no
08:50 no no mr. Reagan you're an actor that's
08:53 why you were hired to do this job so act
08:56 act presidential as they say Clinton oh
09:01 my god you serious that guy is up to his
09:05 balls in rape charges are consigning the
09:10 [ __ ] out of people I mean what's really
09:14 strange about their crime to capital
09:18 punishment assassination ratio is that
09:22 it seems like
09:24 if they like they could have gotten
09:27 themselves out of a lot of the scandals
09:29 that they seem to have been in but
09:31 instead they default to death like kill
09:35 that guy why cuz he knows I stole a
09:37 packet of gum okay blow his head off
09:40 with a shotgun right that's the typical
09:42 way that people died in Arkansas before
09:44 he moved into the presidential slots
09:48 right
09:49 then comes Bush jr. who uh sirs in the
09:52 neocon 9/11 stuff and you know for the
09:57 most part he was pretty much just a head
10:00 ornament on this country he really
10:02 didn't address the people that much you
10:04 know I don't think he really wanted to
10:07 be President I mean I don't think he
10:09 hated it you know being in the history
10:10 books for the rest of his life but I
10:12 honestly think that he's just like leave
10:14 me alone again I talked to a guy in
10:18 Australia who claims to have been
10:20 college roommates with Bush jr. and he
10:24 told me secretly that again this is
10:27 hearsay but he was very adamant about it
10:29 and seemed to be very intelligent but he
10:31 said you know Bush jr. loves Trump loves
10:35 again so I don't know if that means he
10:38 likes the entertainment factor of Trump
10:40 or he himself was like man you know I
10:46 was sitting in a kindergarten room not
10:49 knowing what the hell was going on and
10:51 then some wish to present my ear that
10:52 this big events occurring and then of
10:55 course he knows the people involved it's
10:58 almost as if they wouldn't trust the guy
11:00 with the information you know Donald
11:02 Rumsfeld Dick Cheney those dudes are
11:05 ballers I mean they can handle and
11:08 orchestrate and design and execute
11:11 anything that's possible right their IQs
11:14 are off the chain that'd mean they're
11:17 good people
11:18 just means if you mess with them you
11:23 better expect a backlash of absolute
11:28 power okay and revenge I'll say that
11:32 much but they knew they couldn't sell
11:34 the right wing agenda any further than
11:37 two
11:38 terms and so here comes Obama absolute
11:41 left-field candidate very much like a
11:44 Clinton candidate although Clinton was a
11:47 you know at least accomplished to some
11:49 degree evil as hell but accomplished but
11:53 he's very much like a Jimmy Carter he
11:54 never heard of this guy before in your
11:55 life and boom the dudes president right
11:58 covers his past up better than Adolf
12:01 Hitler and that's a goddamn fact
12:05 eventually gets his birth rights
12:08 questioned by Trump and then he submits
12:11 to the public a layered PDF file
12:13 absolutely proving beyond a shadow of a
12:15 doubt that his birth certificate is a
12:17 complete forgery it was eventually
12:19 submitted to the forensics forensics
12:22 headquarters of the country of Italy
12:24 they had found the original birth
12:26 certificate that that was forged from
12:29 improved with a scanner the 76% of all
12:32 the pixels in the one that submitted to
12:34 the public belonged to a different
12:35 gentleman and the other 24% were all the
12:43 digits that they changed in his birth
12:45 certificate to make it original okay
12:49 again I used to be an optical character
12:51 recognition scan experts for four very
12:57 laborious years and I can tell you
12:59 looking at the PDF I could go into a
13:03 court of law and prove it that it's a
13:04 fake okay why go through all that
13:08 because in the last eight years for sure
13:12 prior to President Trump getting elected
13:15 there was a massive [ __ ] tube going
13:18 on in the United States of America to
13:20 absolutely hobble us to undermine the
13:26 budgets of all military and police and
13:29 to demonize the police and the public
13:30 eye to create this discourse and the
13:32 foundation of a civil war they
13:36 propagated division between blacks and
13:39 whites between people who recognized the
13:43 fact that we have two genders in this
13:45 [ __ ] planet and you can be gay all
13:47 you want you still acknowledge your
13:49 gender but then they push all this other
13:51 weird
13:51 mental illness [ __ ] on us right you
13:55 don't get to [ __ ] with the biology of
13:57 human being simply because you get
13:58 offended and you have a mental illness
13:59 I'm really [ __ ] sorry you know really
14:02 sorry we wish you the best no one wishes
14:04 you any harm
14:05 hope you pull through it hey you could
14:08 do whatever the [ __ ] you want with your
14:09 life
14:09 just don't hurt anybody else and no
14:11 one's gonna mess with you but you know
14:14 we're not gonna create a drop-down
14:15 [ __ ] option for you when it says
14:16 what's your gender we're not putting
14:19 anybody in jail because they hurt your
14:20 goddamn feelings right toughen up
14:22 snowflake but they sold our military
14:25 secrets they sold how to build what we
14:29 make some of the most covert
14:30 technologies on planet Earth they gave
14:33 away codes that allow foreign countries
14:37 to penetrate our communications to
14:43 control some of our military devices
14:45 such as satellites and perhaps even Jets
14:50 everything can be remote-controlled I
14:52 mean that's that's not hopefully a
14:54 surprise for you once we flew drones
14:56 they take off fly attack and land well
15:01 you don't think they have that [ __ ] in
15:02 every single plane out there now this
15:03 old hardware out there that most likely
15:06 doesn't have this kind of stuff in it
15:07 just like your old car it doesn't have
15:08 an airbag but everything is formidable
15:12 everything it's amazing definitely can
15:14 be controlled right you know if a b-2
15:19 bomber costs a couple billion dollars to
15:22 make and the pilot for whatever reason
15:26 has a goddamn heart attack up there
15:28 traveling it whatever it is eighty to a
15:31 hundred thousand feet I don't know
15:32 anything about the altitude of that
15:34 particular plane but say it's way the
15:36 hell up there you're gonna let a two
15:37 billion dollar plane just fall out of
15:39 the sky when it's absolutely packed with
15:42 technology that we don't want anyone
15:43 else to see hell no they're gonna
15:46 automatically take over for the controls
15:50 probably something on board and then
15:52 NORAD's gonna land that thing
15:54 wright-patterson Air Force Base or
15:56 whatever they're gonna probably pull it
15:59 down and some you know bases close by
16:01 what's this have to do with the border
16:04 but Hillary Clinton was definitely
16:06 supposed to be the President of the
16:07 United States in 2016 according to the
16:10 deep state and the five eyes but all
16:12 those that we need to purge from this
16:15 world
16:17 why did she
16:19 why was she supposed to be the president
16:21 because she has a pay-for-play platform
16:25 you know if any of you deal in internet
16:27 technologies you know she had her own
16:29 little WordPress for hey give me some
16:31 money and I'll get that deal done for
16:33 you I'm the secretary of state
16:35 [ __ ] you want a bunch of uranium
16:37 out of America no problem you want all
16:40 of our nukes no problem you you know you
16:42 want anything out of here you want a big
16:44 weapons deal that no one would ever
16:45 really give you or allow well I'll get
16:48 it done have you ever wondered how the
16:53 deep state funds what they do I mean as
16:58 screwed up as you think the the
16:59 government budgets are and they are
17:00 definitely screwed up being cleaned up
17:03 in a big way recently like I mean all
17:06 year long in 2017 and 2018 you hear
17:09 these reports that the Pentagon got
17:12 caught buying ballpoint pens for 500
17:14 bucks a piece or you know a bunch of
17:16 other crazy spending and you know the
17:20 only thing that's changed is the common
17:22 denominator which is the President of
17:23 the United States they've changed this
17:26 and so that's a big deal for some of us
17:31 I hope it's no big surprise to most of
17:34 you that the primary method by which the
17:37 deep state funds what they do is through
17:41 the sale of drugs it is one of the most
17:45 amazing things for them think about it
17:47 you put a seed in the ground you water
17:50 it you nurture it you pay some guy ten
17:53 cents on the dollar for this thing or
17:55 even a penny on the dollar you wrap it
17:59 all up you refine it you store it and
18:02 then you distribute it and you give it
18:05 to the ghettos and they sell it screws
18:08 up everyone's life along the way right
18:11 second that drug leaves a country that
18:13 it's not
18:14 legal to possess like say you grow a
18:18 bunch of poppy seeds in Afghanistan to
18:23 do heroin ii it's moved out of
18:27 Afghanistan and taken to a country where
18:29 heroin is illegal everyone starts paying
18:31 a price automatically they get caught
18:34 with it they get put in jail forever
18:35 they'll fight over it and kill each
18:37 other for it
18:40 and that goes all the way down to the
18:42 street corner where it's handed off to
18:43 somebody and then of course the person
18:45 who takes it [ __ ] up their life all
18:48 right yeah yes there's fringe cases
18:50 where people use their doctors to take
18:52 care of one Keith Richards has always
18:54 been under prescription for that drug
18:55 and that's why he's still alive I would
19:01 wager that 99.9% of everyone else is
19:04 taking this on their own and they decide
19:07 how much they take based on what kind of
19:09 day they've had right the other big drug
19:12 is cocaine cocaine is largely grown in
19:15 South America and it has been
19:21 responsible for disasters of all levels
19:26 all magnitudes people losing their lives
19:29 from just taking crack cocaine the
19:32 mixdown version of it too taking the
19:34 real stuff back in the day no mystery to
19:36 anyone right but when you can grow
19:39 something for damn near free and turn it
19:42 because there's a demand it's worth
19:45 trillions of dollars every single year
19:48 globally again I just mentioned this but
19:53 Berkeley University did did a test by
19:56 calling up the government and saying how
19:59 much how much opium is taken every day
20:01 how much cocaine is taken every day and
20:04 it did the math on how to bring that in
20:06 how to supply that like a FedEx like how
20:08 would you supply the public with as much
20:11 as the government says that they consume
20:13 and you can only assume that the
20:14 government is not telling or doesn't
20:16 know excuse me the true consumption of a
20:19 day I don't know if they round up I
20:22 would imagine they round down if they're
20:23 trying to give anyone the impression
20:26 that the drug
20:27 the war on drugs is working right
20:31 there's like 40 c-130s the biggest cargo
20:34 jets that the military has actually I
20:38 shouldn't say that there's probably one
20:39 new one that's out there and someone's
20:40 gonna tippy-tap and complain but it's a
20:43 big plane okay so this is gonna tie
20:47 together some stuff I've said in you
20:49 know digressions and other episodes so
20:52 hopefully this will make a lot more
20:52 sense to you in 2017 if you especially
20:56 if you go look on lively comm they have
20:59 videos of opium farms being Tomahawk
21:05 missile in Afghanistan quite a few as a
21:08 matter of fact there's one compilation I
21:11 believe that like 20 different attacks
21:14 hmm well it's no mystery who owns and
21:19 operates those those storage facilities
21:23 it's essentially the place where it's
21:25 all refined and stored and bundled up
21:27 right but these are being destroyed
21:30 almost immediately after Trump becomes
21:32 president of the United States you know
21:34 what he takes office well now isn't that
21:39 a military operation well this whole you
21:42 know I'm not gonna lean on it too much
21:44 because I'm very skeptical at this point
21:46 but the whole q and on phenomenon and
21:49 the claim of the q and on source is from
21:54 the NSA right a national security
21:56 association right the way they operate
21:59 is they spy on everyone they gather a
22:01 copy of everything phone calls text
22:03 messages and I mean everything right and
22:07 that's before they suspect you of
22:09 anything if they suspect you of
22:10 something then though they will be up
22:13 your ass like you know bugs on gas as
22:15 they say right I don't know why that's
22:17 the same but anyway so but they don't
22:21 look at your stuff until there's a FISA
22:23 warrant to look at you they need to have
22:26 probable cause to examine your data and
22:29 again there's not enough human beings in
22:30 the NSA or our artificial intelligence
22:34 to be able to examine all that data so
22:39 rest assured
22:40 you're not gonna be you know looked at
22:45 until there's something huge then
22:48 there's this other alphabet agency
22:50 starts with the C and they have been the
22:54 renegade rogue top dog of the world
22:59 since the 50s
23:01 okay they also have a lot of spying
23:07 technology but they are the ones that
23:12 control all the drug trade in the world
23:14 at least as it as it relates to the
23:17 United States of America supply which
23:20 you know we roll hard you know if we get
23:24 into heroin goddamn it we take more than
23:26 anybody if we get into cocaine we take
23:28 more than anybody it may not be legal
23:30 but we consume more than everyone
23:32 because we're so malleable right but
23:35 their stuff started getting destroyed
23:36 mmm interesting now according to this
23:41 cue and on guy they're supercomputers
23:45 Snow White and seven dwarfs have all
23:47 been either seized or destroyed or both
23:52 they're big satellite in space called
23:55 Big Bird has also been commandeered or
23:57 destroyed you know you would think you'd
24:00 want to come and do these things and
24:02 grab them and try to find out what
24:03 they've been doing
24:04 perhaps there are no logs on such
24:06 devices if that's the case you simply
24:08 destroy it to ensure that no one else
24:10 can gain control over it it is now
24:13 asserted that all of the the codes that
24:16 have been sold off to other countries
24:19 through the Clinton Foundation and folks
24:21 which is the assertion of course the
24:23 alleged assertion that those have all
24:29 been scrambled technology has been
24:30 renewed and one of the reasons why the
24:33 military is being SuperDuper funded
24:35 right now is twofold one to build it
24:38 back up to what it was to to re-engineer
24:41 a bunch of things that have been
24:42 compromised so what does the border
24:45 slash wall have to do with all this
24:46 we're at 30 minutes roughly the border
24:52 represents a gigantic opening / aperture
24:58 for drugs to continue funneling into
25:01 this country now for those of you who
25:03 study the Mena Arkansas scandal of the
25:06 70s and 80s you have a true situation
25:10 where in the Ozarks of Arkansas there's
25:14 a bunch of runways at least a couple
25:18 runways up there that took in the c-130s
25:21 with the refined cocaine and heroin from
25:26 various regions of the world and then
25:30 their helicopter down taken into smaller
25:32 planes and distributed until the ghettos
25:35 get it and like again eazy-e said I
25:37 don't know a drug dealer with the
25:39 passport or I'm sorry I ghetto pusher
25:42 with the passport it's basically saying
25:44 none of us ever leave our neighborhood /
25:46 the country and yet we're selling all
25:49 these drugs that are from outside the
25:51 country so how the hell do you think we
25:52 get it I was trying to tell you the
25:55 government brings it to us right these
25:56 agencies these alphabet agencies bring
25:59 it to us
26:00 easiiy made a million dollars before
26:03 1987 selling drugs so the dude was a
26:08 very informed informant and he's no
26:11 longer with us
26:13 he was probably perceived as a massive
26:16 liability of making statements like that
26:17 just put the target on him more and more
26:21 right and easy most likely did not die
26:25 of this I get into a conspiracy here but
26:31 this whole thing with AIDS is has been
26:37 largely debunked it is a sickness that
26:40 happens but it happens because of drug
26:42 use cocaine and heroin being the top two
26:45 drugs that you can consume that will
26:47 destroy your t-cells if you go in and
26:50 get a ZT as a result of being diagnosed
26:52 with a t-cell problem a Z T kills a
26:54 hundred percent of its patients right
26:56 usually within a year two years if
27:00 you're real strong
27:02 and so you know he was a huge drug user
27:06 and say most likely creamed his t-cell
27:09 production by taking so many drugs and
27:12 as his band was falling apart he was
27:14 taking more and more drugs you know he's
27:17 trying to do a reunion at the end there
27:18 and so he probably just popped it he
27:20 wasn't a really big guy physically so he
27:23 probably rolled harder than Charlie
27:25 Sheen with that stuff and just blew out
27:27 his immune system and eventually died of
27:29 it and of course they blame it on AIDS
27:32 because that's the the catch-all for
27:34 that particular problem and just for any
27:36 of you that you know want to look that
27:41 up definitely look up you know the AIDS
27:44 hoax and it is it is not a bunch of
27:47 people sitting in their living rooms
27:49 you're talking about the world experts I
27:51 think they're called virologists the
27:53 guys that study viruses they demanded
27:56 the World Health Organization and that
27:58 the in the United States Health
28:00 Organization run out of the White House
28:03 whatever that's really called prove that
28:05 HIV was connected to AIDS and there was
28:09 no paperwork scientific paperwork that
28:11 brings the two together and so they said
28:15 look once you're diagnosed with HIV
28:16 relax because you didn't die of it
28:19 because it will kill you in three weeks
28:20 if it's gonna kill you and you just have
28:22 antibody that identifies itself as HIV
28:25 and it will never become some immune
28:26 system problem for you stop taking drugs
28:29 I guess gay men use something called
28:32 poppers and those things were identified
28:35 in this documentary as the top
28:40 destruction mechanism for the human
28:43 t-cells in Africa it's all about
28:45 malnutrition and that kind of stuff but
28:49 anyway back onto the border what Donald
28:52 Trump is trying to do with the border is
28:54 to block physically the import of drugs
28:59 over the southern border now there's
29:03 more to it than just that but imagine
29:06 you block the physical transportation of
29:08 drugs across the border
29:10 didn't I just tell you that it's a bunch
29:12 of c-130s and all that stuff yes
29:14 but think about this the military can
29:18 control the sky that may already be
29:19 controlled right now we know the
29:22 military tomahawk the [ __ ] out of
29:23 everything in Afghanistan that produces
29:25 drugs will they try to start back up
29:28 again sure they will the warlords of
29:31 Afghanistan were known as the Northern
29:33 Alliance during the invasion of
29:34 Afghanistan but they were just poppy
29:36 seed farmers until 1979 or so when Zig
29:41 knew Brzezinski went over there and got
29:44 them all jihadist indoctrinated they
29:48 didn't give a crap about all that stuff
29:49 they just grew sold lived that was it
29:53 right now for any of you are skeptical
29:56 about the drugs coming across the border
29:59 I would say you've been living under a
30:01 rock for the past year because there's
30:04 been countless news articles reports
30:10 eyewitness testimony from people that
30:13 live on the American side of the border
30:14 saying drugs are coming across and
30:17 bundles they're throwing giant bundles
30:19 across or over fences into people's
30:21 backyards and then they traverse the
30:23 thing by themselves and of course
30:25 they're armed and dangerous and it's a
30:28 it's a shitty thing that's going on down
30:29 there but I met a gentleman at my smoke
30:33 lounge who was a best friend of the guy
30:37 owns a place and not a drifter he's I
30:42 think he was like he was half Middle
30:45 Eastern and half Mexican which is a very
30:46 interesting thing grip in America of
30:49 course I think he did grow up a little
30:52 bit in Mexico so he speaks fluent
30:54 Spanish but he works for the government
30:56 in or he did work for the government in
31:00 DC for quite a while and as part of his
31:02 leg was homeland security was where he
31:05 was working part of his tour working for
31:07 homeland security was to tour through
31:09 Border Patrol and so he was sent to the
31:12 southern border told the story once back
31:14 in season one right when he told me but
31:19 he was on guard duty with a guy who was
31:22 working there full-time and his job that
31:26 day
31:28 was to hold a rifle in his hand and
31:31 shoot anybody who came across the border
31:34 in this one really volatile area so the
31:37 way he told the stories he worked there
31:38 for a few weeks and not every single day
31:42 had any issues like they do tell people
31:44 to you know go back and don't don't
31:47 cross and some of them kind of least
31:48 huddle and go back and rethink things
31:50 but he said that he witnessed this guy
31:53 with this sharpshooter rifle fire on
31:57 some people killing them then he passed
32:01 the gun to the other guy either I don't
32:03 lay tur that day or the next day but he
32:06 said he gave me this weapon he goes you
32:08 know I've never killed anybody in my
32:09 life and now they're giving me this this
32:11 scoped rifle to shoot people and here
32:15 comes what appears to be a husband and
32:17 wife and the wife was holding a baby and
32:20 they do go shoot him their way past all
32:24 the warnings shoot him we we bullhorn
32:26 them they're not stopping
32:28 and the guys like what are you talking
32:30 about that's a mother holding a baby and
32:32 the dude goes it's not a [ __ ] baby
32:35 dude it's a big bundle of something
32:37 shoot him and so he won't do it gives
32:44 the gun the other guy warning shot
32:46 nothing pow pow they're dead he goes get
32:50 in the Jeep so they go down there and
32:52 the chick was holding a big bundle of
32:54 drugs can't remember exactly what drug I
32:57 doubt it's weed but he says see see I
33:02 was right I'm gonna doing this job you
33:04 know for ten years like what's the deal
33:06 here
33:06 you've been told that these are just
33:09 innocent people cross on this border and
33:10 they're bringing in drugs for a coyote
33:13 and they don't stop I don't follow the
33:17 law what do you think is gonna happen to
33:19 our country if this keeps coming in here
33:21 the dude was just mortified and he left
33:25 this is I gotta get out of here cuz I
33:28 can't kill people
33:30 but what's Trump accused of right with
33:33 this border wall thing that he's a
33:35 racist because the first thing that he
33:38 started campaigning on was a wall it's
33:44 part of a master agenda to get rid of
33:47 everything that would fund the shadow
33:50 government agencies now they'll always
33:53 make money one way or the other they
33:55 will right because they control the
33:59 manufacturing of money currently right
34:01 Trump has also talked about getting us
34:03 back on a gold standard getting off via
34:05 currency thus cutting them off from our
34:09 GDP now at the same time we do have a
34:12 gigantic budgetary problem and if you
34:14 live in any state other than a southern
34:17 state right California Arizona Nevada
34:20 Texas and even you don't live in Florida
34:25 so you don't have any of this southern
34:28 border invasion into your state and your
34:30 state doesn't have to absorb all these
34:32 individuals that are legally here right
34:34 I need you to understand that if you
34:36 were here in Southern California Orange
34:39 County and your father your mother your
34:43 wife your husband your kid is suffering
34:45 from an acute illness all of a sudden
34:48 and you have to take your kid to the
34:50 hospital you will have to have insurance
34:53 which is going to give you a lot of
34:54 anxiety and you go to the emergency room
34:59 it's absolutely packed with freeloaders
35:03 people who aren't citizens of the United
35:05 States do not speak English for the most
35:07 part and are clogging up the system and
35:11 they're there for a sniffle a little
35:13 thing but you can't get in there for a
35:16 potentially a life-threatening situation
35:17 I've had this happen to me personally
35:20 it's frustrating it costs us billions
35:23 and billions of dollars right lowest
35:26 estimates I believe 130 billion a year
35:27 the highest system it's 230 billion a
35:29 year [ __ ] man if it was 1 billion a year
35:33 we've got a goddamn problem on our hands
35:35 right we got kids running around with
35:37 $100,000 student loans that they can't
35:40 pay off which makes some snowflakes
35:42 because they're so pissed off they want
35:43 socialism
35:44 because they need someone to pay all
35:45 their bills right but if we could just
35:48 pay that [ __ ] off and then get them some
35:52 decent education because we can spend
35:53 those billions of dollars on ourselves
35:57 we start repairing the very fabric of
35:59 your kids of your family of the people
36:03 you have to deal with every single day
36:05 so the border wall does have an
36:07 immigration improvement again if I
36:13 wanted to go be a citizen of any
36:15 European country I have to prove that I
36:18 have skills that are unique to their
36:20 citizens right they're gonna go well if
36:23 a French person can do it why will we
36:25 bring you in here to displace a French
36:27 job all the countries over there same
36:31 thing and we do the same thing with them
36:35 but when there's this border that says
36:38 hey just walk across even if you're
36:41 captured you're released and then it's
36:43 just a bunch of [ __ ] about coming
36:45 back to report seven years later right
36:48 immigration from Mexico to the United
36:50 States I believe intimately will be
36:53 widely increased legally the cap of
36:56 everybody you can come in this country
36:58 on a yearly basis could be tripled if
37:01 not quadrupled because we will then be
37:05 bringing them in on merit but now what
37:08 about the humanitarian thing of this
37:10 whole deal right well some of you have
37:12 seen that presentation the guy did I
37:15 don't know where the hell he did it but
37:16 he had a bunch of glass jars of marbles
37:19 or bubblegum things or whatever and he
37:23 was trying to show you how much of the
37:25 world is third-world and how much of the
37:27 world's first world and even if you grab
37:31 a hundred million people out of the
37:33 third world group and drop them into the
37:36 first world you haven't made a dent in
37:39 all these people that you supposedly
37:40 want to rescue they have to rescue
37:44 themselves right now the odd thing is is
37:47 that the cognitive dissidence meter can
37:51 be absolutely quickly assessed by asking
37:55 your population what they think about
37:56 illegal immigration
37:58 your country because it makes no goddamn
38:01 sense at all right why do you have a
38:04 country how did that happen well some
38:08 point someone fought to keep your
38:11 country or to give your country its
38:13 identity its nationalism you fought to
38:17 own the land on a daily basis and you
38:20 know there's that time lapse on the
38:22 internet of all the wars that happened
38:24 in Europe and how the borders moved all
38:25 around Germany was massive at one point
38:27 and it's it's amazing to see what we've
38:31 done but now largely the last several
38:34 hundred years the borders in Europe
38:35 don't move that much right you know
38:38 around Turkey it moves a little bit but
38:40 even in the North America South America
38:41 the borders haven't moved much so we're
38:44 kind of content with who we are as
38:45 individuals only recently as George
38:48 Soros the villain of the entire [ __ ]
38:52 planet has invested billions of dollars
38:56 to mess everything up right he's got
39:00 some agenda to [ __ ] start a bunch of
39:02 craziness well four countries held up by
39:06 its citizens that are willing to die for
39:08 the land to keep everything the way you
39:12 know in an average mean of the
39:14 nationalism identity and cultural ISM
39:16 that we have then why would you want to
39:19 move a bunch of people into the country
39:21 that have no backbone to defend their
39:24 own land it's really just as simple as
39:27 that so it's the meek it's the low IQ
39:32 that typically brings a lot of disease
39:35 and burden on society because you know
39:38 maybe they know how to push a lot more
39:40 maybe right maybe they know how to do
39:43 something with our hands maybe but we
39:46 don't know why because they're illegal
39:48 and whatever talks to them no one ever
39:50 sees if they have any skills before they
39:52 let them in to take all of our social
39:53 programs you have to pay every single
39:58 day for these programs in the United
40:00 States of America through your taxes
40:02 through your your district taxes your
40:04 local taxes etc etc state federal
40:08 there's all these props that sneak in
40:10 right every
40:11 up in the United States which is this
40:13 little side thing that you vote on in
40:16 our district level that all taxes it's
40:19 all taxes in almost every case every
40:22 once in a while there's like a moral
40:23 agenda prop 8 that says gay people can't
40:26 be married to each other can on camera
40:28 which way it went that's that's kind of
40:31 a one-off situation imagine you were in
40:34 South America and you heard that America
40:37 was the promised land it was a big
40:39 goddamn border between you and then
40:41 there's two of them there's a Irongate
40:42 border and there's a big cement border
40:46 well you put borders around things and
40:51 walls around things that have value
40:53 right the Vatican's got a gigantic wall
40:55 all palatial neighborhoods in the United
40:58 States have gates around them houses
41:00 have individual gates around them why
41:03 because there's a lot of valuable things
41:05 in the middle think about an average
41:07 castle in the Middle Ages of some sort
41:09 right you've got land everywhere and
41:11 some nomadic little tribes did of
41:14 scavenged you know wood and water and
41:16 all these different things but then the
41:18 castles got gold in it it's got armor in
41:20 it it has history and in books it has
41:23 all kinds of stuff right you protect
41:26 that because it was hard to get it was
41:28 hard to make and if it gets pillaged by
41:30 a bunch of people that have no
41:32 appreciation for what those things are
41:34 the man goes backwards in time there's a
41:37 philosopher by the name of Kenneth Burke
41:39 long gone but not forgotten and he was
41:43 one that put a lot of effort into
41:45 pioneering the understanding of
41:48 scapegoating scapegoating on an
41:51 individual level but scapegoating more
41:53 importantly on a socialistic level
41:55 entire countries blaming another country
41:59 for their problems and then trying to do
42:02 whatever they can to hurt them now South
42:05 America is largely a mix of European
42:08 blood and South American blood right
42:12 you're Mexican nation is a combination
42:14 of all the indigenous native of Native
42:17 Americans Native Southern America South
42:18 American folks with the Spanish when
42:22 there's course there's French cultures
42:23 in there and all kinds of stuff but
42:25 mostly
42:25 right so it's a cool mix we got a really
42:28 cool new nation out of that moment but
42:34 they have been indoctrinated for I'm
42:38 gonna say over a hundred years into
42:40 utterly hating and blaming the United
42:43 States of America for all their problems
42:45 and they have been told that they're
42:49 going to take over North America for
42:51 over a hundred years a good friend of
42:55 mine he's asked Tec his family was
42:59 always north of the border when they
43:01 sealed it off back in the day so he
43:03 never had to cross the border to be
43:06 legal so he's never been an illegal
43:07 immigrant but his mother back in the 50s
43:10 won a beauty pageant and as part of the
43:15 reward for the beauty pageants as I
43:17 believe I have this correctly remembered
43:20 she went down to Mexico City to do some
43:25 University work and some speeches and
43:28 that kind of thing and the story is is
43:31 that she was told very quickly when she
43:37 went into these institutions that they
43:38 don't like her they don't want her there
43:40 and they said brace yourself because
43:44 we're gonna be taking your country over
43:46 and this was in 1956 hmm a lot of us
43:53 thought that was a recent la raza
43:54 movement nope that indoctrination has
43:58 been going on forever but now think
44:00 about it why would you want to take over
44:02 North America when you have the entire
44:04 South American continent to yourself
44:07 they've got beautiful land beautiful
44:11 [ __ ] land why do people go to Costa
44:13 Rica because it's gorgeous
44:16 there inland areas are just as gorgeous
44:18 as any place on earth great weather
44:21 there they have a great culture a great
44:24 peaceful you know circle that they do
44:28 every single day and all these different
44:29 areas they've got beautiful artists so
44:33 there's no there's no limit of
44:34 entertainment and
44:36 and they've got great food and culture
44:37 everything rain why on earth would they
44:40 want to come up here hmm well let's
44:45 think about it if you were to take it
44:48 that those time-lapse maps on YouTube
44:51 and you create one for South America and
44:53 you have a color that is dictator and a
44:56 color that is a democratically elected
44:58 official which is probably you know in
45:00 large cases Bilderberg people from time
45:02 to time let's say red is dictator in
45:06 blue is democratically elected official
45:09 you've got that place red for almost its
45:12 entire history every single country in
45:15 South America is sitting in the red zone
45:17 with a dictator if they have a
45:21 democratically elected person like for
45:23 instance Mexico you have almost every
45:26 single President of Mexico having to get
45:29 approval by the drug cartel and 39
45:33 families that run that joint before you
45:35 can become president and then you have
45:37 to serve them and don't touch them your
45:39 entire administration your entire reign
45:45 I should say excuse me ministration is
45:46 an entity at a time sequence right so
45:49 you got a free country the freest
45:51 country on planet earth which is America
45:53 and believe me we know we're duped about
45:55 a lot of our freedoms of course since
45:57 9/11 we've had a Fourth Amendment
46:00 compromised big time but now you're
46:05 gonna let a bunch of people in who love
46:06 dictators hmm how do you let a dictator
46:12 run your country well it means you don't
46:15 know what a non dictator represents
46:19 right dictator you know there there are
46:22 dictators that I guess have done fairly
46:25 good things for their countries but they
46:27 always seem to come in with this this
46:30 you know dossier of utter darkness
46:35 before they get there right I mean
46:38 Chavez run ran in Venezuela and under
46:41 his reign reign the country did seem to
46:43 prosper quite a bit but the rumors about
46:46 that guy is he's an ex drug cartel guy
46:50 he was a brute he was a badass right now
46:55 again you want to be a president in an
46:58 era in an area of the world where it's
47:00 really rough right if you want to be the
47:01 president of Colombia
47:02 you better be one rough dude and you're
47:06 gonna have to be one to know one to be
47:09 able to fight amongst them right or
47:11 among them I don't know which way to do
47:13 that so maybe those are the requirements
47:16 right Putin Putin does Russia a solid
47:20 for the most part but he used to work
47:23 for the KGB a job he was told to take
47:26 not offered to take right gotta get that
47:29 straight in your head you didn't choose
47:31 evil it's just you're pushed into it
47:33 when you live in a communist ik Russian
47:35 government right which is largely
47:38 changed no right he only was able to
47:41 take office because he guarantee Yeltsin
47:44 he wouldn't charge him with anything
47:46 full on corruption but what are you
47:49 gonna do you live in a paradigm that's
47:51 not America you only have limited
47:53 choices
47:54 well now let's look at South American
47:57 give him some credit are the majority of
48:00 people in South America coming to North
48:04 America and breaking through our wall or
48:06 walking across our border no 99.9% of
48:10 the people in South America are fully
48:12 content with South America for those
48:16 that are discontent with their
48:18 government a lot of them are trying to
48:19 change it now they're getting duped
48:22 right Brazil is in a horrible situation
48:26 if Ennis whales in a hard coral
48:28 situation Argentina's selling their
48:30 rainforest for God's sake are there
48:33 space programs out of the South South
48:35 America not really
48:39 are there huge technological advances
48:42 coming out of South America not really
48:44 so you have a a more homey continent
48:49 right there they're more content with
48:51 just living life procreating having
48:54 their families enjoying themselves and
48:56 join their amazing cultures and they're
48:57 all different up and down the continent
48:59 so it's kind of a peaceful little play
49:02 it's a big-ass place but that's a lot of
49:05 it's not inhabited just like our little
49:08 slice of life up here and they're not
49:11 trying to push through the border so who
49:13 who are trying to push through the
49:15 border who is this right the folks that
49:18 are suffering quite a bit from
49:21 everything they're suffering sort of an
49:25 identity crisis they're not willing to
49:27 again identify with their nation in a
49:29 way that brings up so much pride that
49:32 they're willing to fight back and that's
49:34 a big deal so what keeps a human being
49:36 upright physically our bone structure
49:40 our spinal cord holds a nervous system
49:45 it's real important structure in the
49:46 human body when we talk about someone's
49:49 integrity they will often talk about
49:50 someone who's got a good backbone or
49:54 what they're spineless all right
49:58 nine states of America's spine is is
50:02 made out of unattainable
50:04 it is extremely strong it's defended by
50:08 our second amendment we're all allowed
50:11 to take training and get guns you try to
50:15 take away our freedoms and you'll have a
50:18 bloodbath and it will be most likely
50:21 most of the military and police will be
50:22 the first line of defense not offense
50:25 right I mean they will defend what they
50:28 have been dying for their whole life
50:29 right but the globalists don't believe
50:34 that but you know don't believe the hype
50:35 is all I can say so a lot of people in
50:39 America recognize you can have the
50:41 spineless move into your solid backbone
50:45 structure and you're without losing your
50:49 country in the process right for me
50:52 that's the greatest threat of the
50:54 immigration process if we lock down the
50:58 border we cut out a lot of the drug
51:01 trafficking the military can take out
51:03 anything flying in the air so that's
51:06 secure if you tomahawk their central
51:10 production facilities then that's a
51:13 that's a done deal but now that's Afghan
51:16 stin pretty easy to blow the [ __ ] out of
51:19 that place it's sort of a nomadic place
51:21 anyway you know it's it's unfortunate
51:24 that any of them grow that [ __ ] you know
51:26 it's a famine stricken country that
51:27 doesn't grow food for [ __ ] sake I mean
51:29 give me a break but you can't do that to
51:31 Colombia can you you can't do that to
51:34 all these places in South America you
51:36 can't just go around tomahawking
51:37 everything so cocaine is something that
51:41 is still largely out of control and a
51:44 production on a production level so the
51:49 only line of defense is the physical
51:51 defense to say you can't bring this
51:53 stuff across the border in a bundle
51:55 pretending to be a baby you get it but
52:01 of course the deep state has got a big
52:03 problem because they're they're largely
52:05 democratic now in America and it could
52:07 have been the other way it could have
52:08 been the Republicans that were largely
52:10 co-opted but it is the Democrats this
52:13 time around Pelosi Schumer Schiff deep
52:18 Staters deep Staters deep Staters I mean
52:22 they better be [ __ ] glad there's a
52:24 lot of laws about you know how we handle
52:28 traitors like this right they carried
52:32 the deep state agenda blatantly in your
52:34 face one of the things you need to
52:36 understand is you know there's a lot of
52:38 frustration with the queue movement or
52:40 queuing on in general because he keeps
52:42 saying that Gitmo is going to be filled
52:44 with these people and the people who'd
52:46 never thought they'd be exposed and
52:47 arrested and properly put to death or at
52:49 least detained for life are gonna be
52:51 detained and it's not happening yet
52:54 right and a big thing again is about
52:57 getting the indictments and getting the
52:59 the testimonies and all the information
53:02 they could possibly get before they take
53:03 them into court because they're going to
53:05 have their day in court whether it be a
53:06 tribunal or not if they're gonna have to
53:08 prove to some official some judge that
53:12 this is you know that the punishment
53:15 they're going to be asking for is legit
53:17 right okay but what he does is he
53:23 he pushes he's pushed Schumer like as of
53:26 this day it's it's Indus it's in January
53:29 of 2019 he's pushed Pelosi and Schumer
53:31 straight out there in the public to show
53:35 the people what kind of [ __ ] these
53:37 people are right there taking endless
53:40 vacations while everyone else is not
53:42 getting paid unbelievable
53:45 [ __ ] balls on these people right and
53:47 Trump is probably the first president
53:50 that stayed in the White House the
53:51 entire time he's been the White House
53:52 almost the entire time little flights
53:54 out for this and that he goes back to
53:56 the White House and he tweets because
53:57 I'm here I'm here when you guys want to
53:59 work this thing out because I'm not
54:01 backing down on my commitment to build a
54:03 wall I'll get it done if I have to use
54:05 the military to build it which is going
54:07 to occur most likely but they're not
54:11 gonna have it and he's just building up
54:14 the lucidity and everyone's mind about
54:17 the issue about their stance on the
54:19 issue about the fact that they all have
54:21 borders around their homes right they
54:24 all travel with these hugely armed
54:26 Secret Service groups to protect them
54:29 but they want to take away guns of
54:31 Americans they're just a [ __ ] paradox
54:34 of catch-22s and denial what you need to
54:40 understand is when they're exposed like
54:42 this it does expose the deep state
54:47 within them because anyone with the
54:49 right goddamn mind would protect their
54:52 country they just would when you're not
54:55 willing to protect your country and
54:56 you're willing to call illegal actions
55:00 we have [ __ ] laws that say you can't
55:02 do things the Democrats never want to
55:06 ever follow the law ever think about how
55:11 they handled the election of 2016 one
55:13 they took all their liberal press which
55:15 is all of it and they said Trump has
55:17 only got a 1% chance of winning then
55:20 when that turned out to be a bunch of
55:22 [ __ ] they still go back to those
55:24 profit news organizations to get their
55:27 perception of the world
55:28 right and they still believe it and
55:31 what's crazy is that the news announcers
55:34 on these liberal media organizations
55:37 this is the magazines the newspapers all
55:39 of it they just got more and more
55:40 [ __ ] insane with their claims about
55:43 impeachment and crimes and tax returns
55:46 and all this other [ __ ] right
55:48 you know I say this every once in a
55:51 while but you know I used to be a
55:52 Democrat when I used to not know [ __ ]
55:55 about anything right when I was
55:56 completely asleep and again the
55:58 Republican Party was not a trump
56:00 Republican party so it's a little bit
56:01 different right but if I was a Democrat
56:04 and I was still asleep and I was looking
56:06 at a Maxine Waters and the this [ __ ]
56:09 walking insane person Cortes and the
56:14 Schumer's and the Pelosi's and they were
56:16 representing my party I would change I
56:19 would completely walk away hashtag walk
56:23 away from those [ __ ] because they
56:25 become a complete embarrassment
56:27 Americans are suffering and they're
56:29 chasing [ __ ] right now again they
56:32 did chase a [ __ ] in the 90s on on
56:36 Clinton you know who knows what ken
56:40 starr's entire objective was just a mess
56:42 with this guy obviously he came in with
56:44 a lot of rape charges that they knew
56:46 about but they couldn't tell anybody
56:48 because he was our president so they're
56:50 trying to kind of expose him I think
56:52 through this Monica Lewinsky thing it in
56:56 itself was nothing you know what's also
57:00 interesting is that the main group of
57:02 people that get in front of cameras and
57:04 say that you know Trump's a racist
57:07 because he wants to build a border to
57:09 protect the country and our sovereignty
57:10 and our laws that already [ __ ] exist
57:13 right our celebrities who have basically
57:17 fallen uphill their entire life right
57:21 they're pretty they're able to say
57:24 someone else's words their entire life
57:27 and get alkyl aids for being these
57:29 amazing characters that they play I mean
57:32 how amazing is that but if you were the
57:34 only actor to ever do Romeo or Juliet it
57:40 was just written Francis Bacon is
57:42 reincarnated boom there it is and then
57:46 everyone loves you because you did these
57:49 two
57:50 characters that were enduring children
57:52 who fell in love and yes they were like
57:54 14 and 15 years old and yep killing each
57:57 other at the end of the of the movie out
57:59 of their love for each other
58:01 accidentally of course they have a
58:04 choice they have a choice to believe
58:06 that they are these fictional characters
58:08 that they wrote this amazing beautiful
58:11 story about - you know lovers stuck in
58:14 families that hate each other you know
58:18 love conquered all sort of thing or they
58:21 can be intelligent human beings to say
58:22 well I'm just an actor
58:24 the story was so well written and so
58:26 compelling it was easy for me to portray
58:28 this fictional character thus gets your
58:30 approval the sales of the tickets and a
58:35 bunch of money was made and you know I'm
58:36 off to my next movie the people that
58:39 want to give all of the tax money to
58:42 these illegals are people that have
58:46 enough money in the bank they never have
58:47 to work again for the rest of their
58:49 lives it's phenomenal right or they may
58:54 not have that much money but they're so
58:56 famous they can just make a phone call
58:58 and say hey I'll do some stand-up comedy
58:59 here or I'll do another movie over there
59:01 and they're right back in the pool of
59:04 cash they don't have any insecurities
59:07 about losing the fabric of the jobs in
59:12 this country and all of the other
59:15 problems that these illegals bring into
59:19 the country now having said all this I
59:21 need you to understand I know a few
59:24 people in Huntington Beach that went
59:27 across the border illegally 20 years ago
59:30 30 years in fact I meant a guy who did
59:32 in 1988 so be 31 years ago he walked up
59:37 the 405
59:37 during the guard change of the border
59:40 control and it was all designed so
59:45 someone picked him up in a car off the
59:46 highway he's literally walking in the
59:48 fast lane shoulder and he said once he
59:52 got to Los Angeles his brothers who were
59:55 already here illegally
59:56 were busting his balls I mean they said
59:58 that you could have that mattress but
59:59 you got to pay 800 bucks a month for it
60:01 which means you need to get a job and
60:04 you can't pay for that bed you're out of
60:06 here so they didn't they didn't get you
60:09 no he didn't get a cakewalk and I don't
60:11 think anyone does get a cakewalk I think
60:12 it's a very very tough thing to move
60:15 your family north right but I also have
60:18 a friend who date's a girl in Mexico
60:22 just across the border and he has
60:25 offered her everything he's offered her
60:28 a home finishing her education he wants
60:32 to have children with her and she would
60:34 not move in and it ended up ending their
60:39 relationship but there's a ton of people
60:41 that don't want to be here even dated a
60:47 girl that has who's actually a citizen
60:49 of the United States of America her
60:51 mother is not and so she moved down with
60:53 her mom I think to take care of her mom
60:56 health-wise he's met her and he's like
61:00 hey well you know you're already a
61:02 citizen why don't you you know move on
61:05 up and we'll start a family she won't do
61:09 it okay so there's this misconception
61:12 that everybody in South America wants to
61:14 be up here now I don't know how far
61:17 spread and infectious the sort of La
61:21 Raza you know we used to own that land
61:23 and we're gonna get it back thing well
61:27 if you're Mexican only part of your
61:28 bloodline ever had any possession of
61:30 this area and it was not that much
61:32 because the Native Americans which is a
61:34 totally separate bloodline pretty much
61:36 owned this entire upper area and again
61:40 every American lives with the
61:42 frustration that if they were wiped out
61:46 you know and very few American families
61:49 I think have anything to do with that
61:53 issue but we still carry the guilt right
61:55 a lot of Americans only came over in the
61:58 1800s / 1900s from from Europe during
62:02 potato famines and that kind of stuff so
62:04 a lot of the clearing was already done
62:06 when they got here now is it is it
62:10 immoral to take advantage of the
62:12 situation I don't know
62:15 you know again we need to do something
62:18 about you know helping the Native
62:20 Americans in this country get the
62:23 education that they need get the land
62:25 that they used to control to some level
62:29 and there wasn't there weren't like 350
62:31 million Native Americans here and nobody
62:33 really knows what the population was so
62:36 they wouldn't need to have the whole
62:37 country to themselves but the
62:40 reservations are hardly doing them any
62:42 benefits right these casinos are
62:44 destroying the families that are being
62:47 used to start them you know probably not
62:51 all of them but the stories I've heard
62:52 are pretty bad but now what's
62:55 interesting is that before the formation
62:58 of America monarchs ran the world they
63:03 did and for a large chunk of America's
63:06 entire history there's you know the
63:09 Constitution United States the
63:10 Declaration of Independence well [ __ ]
63:12 man it's only a couple hundred years old
63:13 right so for at least a couple hundred
63:16 years before that happened monarchs were
63:18 still ruling and they thought you know
63:20 America's ours we paid for it and it's
63:22 gonna remain ours and it didn't work out
63:25 the Revolutionary War occurs we took it
63:27 back or took it from them they're still
63:31 pissed about it that's why they want to
63:32 destroy America one of the biggest
63:34 reasons it is like something that isn't
63:38 discussed but once America got the
63:41 constitution United States enforced and
63:43 we won a few wars against these
63:45 individuals what happened the template
63:48 of freedom was once again resurrected
63:51 again about a thousand ad you had the
63:55 you know Magna Carta helped the people
63:57 for a little while but it was
63:58 immediately compromised just like the
64:00 Constitution is being compromised today
64:02 but if you're in South America and you
64:04 want to know how to build your country
64:05 to be a democratically elected free
64:08 country well there's no there's no
64:11 mystery about how to do it anymore
64:13 you need a constitution of your country
64:15 definitely would suggest plagiarizing
64:18 the first ten Bill of Rights in the
64:20 United States you probably add again the
64:23 ability for women to vote and the you
64:27 know equality among races and that's
64:29 two thing maybe throw in some LGBT stuff
64:32 in there to make sure everyone doesn't
64:34 get you know lynched for just having a
64:36 difference of opinion but it's out there
64:39 the templates out there to fix your
64:41 country now what happens in these
64:43 countries South America how many
64:45 countries can you actually legally own a
64:47 weapon not that many they have them but
64:53 they have to worry about getting caught
64:55 with them if they get caught with one
64:57 the miles will just have the shootout
64:58 because they're gonna go to jail for a
64:59 long time what's really fascinating to
65:04 me is that you every time I meet someone
65:09 from South America I am meeting someone
65:12 who is unequivocally one of the sweetest
65:17 human beings I've ever met in a big way
65:21 it's sort of like America maybe 60 70
65:24 years ago maybe even longer where
65:28 everyone's willing to help help each
65:29 other out so the quality of some of
65:33 these human beings I would say probable
65:35 I just haven't been down there so I
65:36 don't really know but of the people I've
65:38 met from all different walks of life
65:39 down there in different countries
65:41 they're usually not scammers they're
65:45 usually folks that want to to just
65:50 contribute to something beautiful they
65:53 feel overwhelmed by obviously their
65:55 country being out of out of whack but
65:58 what stimulated the big pop in America
66:01 right I'm going to say education
66:05 education education through experience
66:10 through wisdom you don't have to have a
66:14 major PhD I shouldn't say the way you
66:19 don't need a PhD in history world
66:21 history which is probably largely full
66:23 of [ __ ] but anyway there's a bunch
66:25 of it that's true about Europe to know
66:29 that for thousands of years in that
66:32 region of the world
66:33 there was a dictatorship either through
66:36 a seizure of Rome or the the five kings
66:41 there was at the six kings right the
66:43 Vikings VI the six kings that dominated
66:47 Europe and established the place
66:50 there's tons of you know fictional and
66:54 documentary films made on all the
66:57 monarchs over there
66:58 but they seldom tell you about the
67:00 repression of those individuals because
67:03 that's not popular among the controlling
67:05 deep States bankers which are now
67:08 largely populated by the monarchs right
67:13 they don't want you to know about the
67:15 stamp tax you know the Inquisition's you
67:20 didn't go against the state before the
67:21 United States of America declared its
67:24 independence because you would disappear
67:27 hell you didn't even go against the
67:29 church because you could disappear well
67:35 what happens in South America you
67:37 disappear it's still the old-school
67:41 technique of running a country
67:44 well how did we pop one we escaped
67:48 across an ocean which was a physical
67:51 barrier from them being able to easily
67:52 bring over an army and cause problems
67:55 for us no they did several times we won
67:59 the Revolutionary War but we lost the
68:00 war of 1812 super-sad we were down on
68:03 our knees because we had been so
68:06 exhausted from expansion from this 27
68:09 year war which was the Revolutionary War
68:12 they got us and they put their bank back
68:15 in our possession well now what about
68:17 all these programs in the Middle East
68:19 where they want to punish a Middle
68:21 Eastern country for not using World Bank
68:23 currency they need to control their oil
68:26 because that allows them to amass
68:27 tremendous wealth fessed power of US
68:29 conspiracy we go over there and we say
68:32 we're rebuilding but we just destroy
68:33 their worlds and leave but now what if
68:36 once in a million claims we actually
68:41 were to help another country we'd really
68:43 help them not just give them money and
68:45 walk away but to say this money must be
68:47 spent in this particular manner
68:48 otherwise you don't get it and it's
68:50 going to be governed the distribution of
68:54 the money will be governed
68:54 by officials from our country because we
68:58 did one thing we secured our country we
69:01 got rid of all the deep state we got rid
69:03 of the fake money politicians actually
69:06 serve the people there's no more fast
69:09 and furious
69:10 you know holder drug money what we might
69:15 sell them m16s for cocaine or something
69:20 and then we bring it back over here so
69:22 we saw a product that probably cost us
69:23 800 bucks to make we get fifty thousand
69:26 dollars worth of retail cocaine out of
69:29 that deal Wow and then we demand if they
69:32 use those guns to keep the drug cartels
69:35 protected right but the point I was
69:38 trying to make before was we do see a
69:42 lot of violence coming out of the
69:49 individuals that do come across the
69:50 border well what about all those
69:52 Hollywood movies were all of our violent
69:54 criminals retreat to Mexico and hide you
69:59 know it's it's all fictional stuff in a
70:01 lot of cases but there's been a lot of
70:02 truth to it too supposedly the kid the
70:04 guy that touched and molested corey
70:07 feldman now lives in mexico because he
70:10 knows he's gonna be outed and now he's
70:11 been outed right but he lived down there
70:15 before he got outed because I think he
70:17 sensed it was time to get out of this
70:19 country
70:21 believe me Mexicans don't tolerate that
70:24 [ __ ] right you can't go into a Mexican
70:26 village and start touching kids they
70:28 will kill your ass and a [ __ ] New
70:30 York minute right I guess I should say
70:34 Mexico City minute a Tijuana minute
70:37 though they'll mess you up
70:38 they don't play those games what blows
70:41 my mind is the gangs that exist and
70:44 again some of them don't come from
70:45 Mexico unfortunately I mean I mean
70:48 fortunately they don't come from Mexico
70:50 but there are some horrendous you know
70:55 murders that happened south of the
70:56 border to enforce drug cartel ownership
71:00 over various parts of the of the
71:02 countries down there and it does blow my
71:05 mind that the sweet people these people
71:07 that I meet any
71:08 their walk of life have the capability
71:11 of being duped into being so violent
71:13 against each other so we do have surplus
71:18 right but now here's the deal
71:22 obviously this country is finding
71:24 somewhere in the neighborhood of 200
71:26 billion dollars a year to pay for the
71:28 services of illegal immigrants that come
71:31 across the border and you know I'm sure
71:33 that number is is including folks that
71:38 are coming from Mexico they're coming in
71:39 from other avenues illegally maybe maybe
71:42 Asia maybe Canada [ __ ] I don't know but
71:44 it's it's everything in one big pot
71:45 right so imagine we secure our border
71:50 cut off the drug trade I put a huge
71:54 dinning right make it a lot easier to
71:55 find these folks getting drugs across
71:58 the border but now we have a surplus of
72:02 200 billion dollars that we didn't have
72:05 before
72:06 one this country needs a lot of money to
72:09 be spent well I would like to see a huge
72:12 chunk of it put back in the arts get you
72:15 know ten billion dollars into the into
72:18 the grade schools for arts all you kids
72:21 are gonna learn how to play an
72:22 instrument
72:23 you're all gonna learn how to paint
72:25 y'all gonna know how to draw you're
72:27 gonna learn how to be artistic you're
72:28 gonna learn how to write story we need
72:31 to bring art back into the hearts of
72:32 kids but imagine we take out of the 200
72:35 billion we get in surplus and again we
72:37 flush out a bunch of student loans right
72:40 budget toxic gas loans fifty billion
72:42 dollars a year boom just pays off these
72:44 loans freeing up these kids to go back
72:47 and get a decent education because
72:49 they're debt-free again right and now
72:52 they'll go get a degree they'll have two
72:53 degrees or I'll have a degree in
72:54 [ __ ] which is okay and it shows that
72:57 they know how to go to school and finish
72:58 a degree then they go back get a decent
73:00 degree but now what if we took 20
73:05 billion fifty billion of that surplus
73:08 and we strategically look at all the
73:11 countries in South America and we go
73:12 okay which country is closest to
73:17 succeeding
73:19 in the way that we portray freedom in
73:22 this world closest country to maybe
73:23 reconstitute to a constitution that has
73:26 protections against freedom of speech
73:28 right to bear arms right to not bees
73:30 dropped on that it uh you know where you
73:32 need to clean up our country first but
73:34 let's just say the basics that they
73:36 don't have all right got a bunch of
73:40 different ways you can spend that money
73:42 we could say this is we'll give you five
73:46 billion dollars let's just say El
73:48 Salvador you get five billion dollars a
73:51 year but it must be spent on education
73:54 education at a grade school level and
73:56 perhaps middle school level our agents
73:59 that are going to cut these checks are
74:02 going to cut the checks to the
74:05 educational institutions in the form of
74:08 buying the books that are going to go to
74:09 your students then we want to see the
74:13 classes taught with these books we have
74:15 to audit the classes they have to be
74:17 getting taught we want to see the test
74:19 results we want to monitor the classes
74:21 physically and we'll pay Americans to go
74:23 down there and do it or will pay your
74:25 folks you know check it just to have
74:27 checks and balances right so it's not
74:29 being stolen someone's saying the
74:32 classes being taught but it's not being
74:33 taught and you infect a brand new
74:35 generation of kids to desire freedom
74:41 sovereignty they look at all the laws in
74:45 their countries and say well there's
74:48 this thing called common law do no harm
74:51 well in Mexico you know there's
74:55 federales and they are sometimes the
74:59 most incredible cops that stop you know
75:01 the standard crime and other times
75:03 they're looking for five hundred to five
75:06 thousand dollars and they'll just pull
75:07 over a tourist and say you did something
75:11 wrong the choice is like what are you
75:12 talking about doesn't matter there's no
75:15 one there to confirm your story so you
75:18 go to a jail you're given as many phone
75:20 calls as you need to call your family
75:21 back in America to satisfy whatever
75:23 money they think you can get out of your
75:25 family if they thought you could get 50
75:27 grand that's what your bail is going to
75:29 be
75:30 your release bail okay
75:33 get I've had employees that five
75:35 employees went to Mexico told him not to
75:38 this was in 2000 they went down there
75:41 and got stuck five of them a couple of
75:44 them girls some home guys and they were
75:47 just roughed up by federales and put in
75:49 jail it's like I think up my employees
75:53 and they're not the kind of people that
75:54 would do well in jail so we had our law
75:56 firm Electronic Arts getting these guys
75:59 out imagine having to make a call to the
76:01 State Department to go look I mean we
76:03 need your help here right you got to put
76:06 some pressure we'll give them some money
76:08 those kids aren't going back I'll tell
76:10 you that much right but there are a lot
76:13 of ways to help these countries prosper
76:17 if that's what you morally think it
76:19 needs to happen you don't have to give
76:21 them your backyard and all the food and
76:23 your refrigerator and all the money in
76:25 your bank right again I want to repeat a
76:28 story that happened to me personally
76:31 back in the 80s I was working the
76:35 software company and you know I said you
76:39 know we're talking about Peace Corps and
76:44 you know somebody was going into Peace
76:47 Corps in our company and I was helping
76:49 him do that just write up all of his
76:53 interviews and referral information all
76:55 that stuff and he got in he did it and I
76:59 remember when he left I told one of our
77:00 make accountant dudes he's a brilliant
77:03 dude I said look you know I've always
77:06 kind of wanted to do that you know I
77:07 won't because I'm in this business but
77:09 you know when I was a kid it seemed like
77:11 a really fun thing to do and they do
77:13 looked at me and he said you know what
77:14 would you believe me if I told you you
77:16 could do them much better getting a good
77:18 job here in America making a bunch of
77:20 money and if you really feel the need to
77:21 help them send the money it's it's way
77:24 better than you going over and doing a
77:26 physical job that someone else and their
77:28 country could do right so it was very
77:31 impactful for me whenever took me 20
77:34 years to even remotely forget that
77:35 phrase that little example so let's go
77:39 at the before we close off here let's go
77:41 at the old rationale which is
77:43 well we're all immigrants that America
77:48 is built out of nothing but immigrants
77:51 okay I hear you well North America was
77:56 obviously populated by Native Americans
77:59 and there's nothing's gonna change the
78:02 wholesale slaughter of that race that
78:05 nation again it's blamed on smallpox and
78:08 the flu and let me tell you folks I
78:11 definitely didn't help anything but I
78:13 think most of them were murdered so
78:16 that's something that you know can't be
78:18 overlooked but it can't be helped
78:19 at this point cuz we're any time
78:21 machines right we're talking about 1500s
78:24 people right but we came over here with
78:28 amazing technology right boats horses
78:32 you know construction methodologies to
78:35 build water aqueducts and arches and
78:39 wheels you know the wheel didn't exist
78:41 on this continent so we brought a bunch
78:44 of know-how upgrading this continent by
78:48 several thousand years of innovation and
78:52 then we built a world and everyone that
78:56 came over was immediately hungry for
78:59 work and yes the world was a lot simpler
79:03 I think some of the jobs that are
79:06 illegals come and take are the kind of
79:09 jobs that the folks from Europe that was
79:12 like the top job back in the day right
79:15 repairing shoes for instance is almost
79:17 exclusively a migrant job here in
79:20 California well that would have been a
79:22 top billing job and say you know sixteen
79:25 hundred slightly different metric there
79:29 took a couple hundred years for some men
79:32 to be born that were interested in
79:36 freedom again they brought their Masonic
79:39 stuff with them so there was always a
79:40 little bit of [ __ ] there America is
79:43 far from a perfect country in terms of
79:45 its laws but what we have built has been
79:48 the best yet
79:52 Europe has had some great interations of
79:55 this freedom as well and there's some
79:56 countries over there they're doing it
79:57 all correctly okay
79:59 they have teeny-tiny populations so
80:02 unfortunately they don't affect the
80:03 world are less than a percent of the
80:05 population of this planet so you know if
80:08 they could spread their brilliance all
80:10 over the planet then we'd be doing great
80:12 but they they're still a teeny tiny
80:14 fraction America is only five percent of
80:16 the world's population right roughly we
80:21 have people like Tesla come over and
80:22 what 1876 he meetly steps off a boat
80:25 fixes a motor on his way walking to
80:28 Edison's plant and makes something like
80:31 some ungodly amount of money for the day
80:35 gets the Edison and says dude I got AC
80:37 alternating current you want in no no I
80:40 got DC working my ass off on this thing
80:43 so massive Minds came over here and used
80:47 the freedom to see that their destinies
80:51 that's the kind of folks we want from
80:53 any country on this planet geniuses
80:56 right that's the kind of folks we want
80:58 from South America geniuses people have
81:02 academic reasons to be here with a wall
81:07 again with a wall we control the
81:11 billions and billions of dollars that
81:12 we're spending on illegal immigration
81:14 right because we will take the citizens
81:16 from South America or from anywhere
81:18 really but definitely from South America
81:20 and we'll say you're gonna get your
81:22 citizenship maybe it's even faster than
81:26 the seven to ten years that you would
81:27 wait for your citizenship but in the
81:31 meantime you're going to be a registered
81:33 participant of this country you're gonna
81:34 pay taxes you're gonna pay for your
81:36 health care which means you're not going
81:39 to fill up the ER rooms and the waiting
81:41 rooms for just a sniffle because
81:44 Americans don't get that privilege right
81:46 we go down and we get Therma flu and
81:48 vitamin C and we do all of our crap
81:50 right we Koff and that's it I think it's
81:55 apples and oranges when you talk about
81:56 Ellis Island and what's going on at the
81:59 South border of the United States of
82:00 America the border has turned into a new
82:06 polarizing galvanizing question like
82:11 abortion you start talking about the
82:15 border you're gonna have a 50/50 chance
82:17 that anyone's going to be with you no
82:19 matter what position you take the
82:23 narrative has been largely controlled by
82:25 the profit news organizations or the
82:27 deep state politicians in my opinion it
82:31 is a no brainer but it's not just a
82:34 border it's not the only solution that
82:36 needs to be had here and I don't think
82:39 that the administration of the United
82:41 States at this time has that as the only
82:43 solution it's just the beginning of a
82:46 greater solution right but no matter how
82:49 much money we would donate to South
82:51 America they are in charge of their
82:52 world they're in charge of their
82:53 continent their individual countries and
82:56 their nationalism obviously something is
82:59 not balanced down there because too many
83:00 people do want to cross the border now
83:02 if you take everyone who crosses the
83:04 border and you subtract out all of the
83:05 drug dealers and all the criminals
83:07 escaping you know across the border to
83:10 escape their local law enforcement then
83:13 you're left with the people that are
83:15 looking for that better life right those
83:19 are the kind of people that could go
83:20 through a legal system I think that's
83:23 where we need to go I would like to see
83:26 a border built I'd like to see concrete
83:29 and not some steel cage that could be
83:30 cut by a cutter right is that it's not
83:33 gonna do [ __ ] but then I'd like to see
83:36 legal immigration increase considerably
83:39 I'd like to see the formalities of
83:42 onboarding and immigrant improved to say
83:46 okay what job you're gonna get what
83:48 family do you already have in the
83:50 country if you're completely barren of
83:53 anybody here you know you're the father
83:55 that wants to come into the country and
83:57 establish yourself so you can go back
83:58 and get your family you've got one plan
84:02 and if you have family art exists here
84:04 you have a separate plan if you're super
84:07 academic and you're just going to come
84:08 in and take a great job because you have
84:10 something special then you have even a
84:13 different plan but these are the things
84:16 that I'm sure these programs exist I've
84:17 never
84:18 grated so I don't know I've had a lot of
84:22 employees come from different countries
84:23 a lot of Asian countries and Russia and
84:27 you know they had to prove themselves
84:29 mathematicians had a mathematician to
84:31 work for me he was on a j-1 visa because
84:33 he was also in school but he had to
84:36 prove that he was a brilliant
84:38 mathematician his mother was a legal
84:40 citizen working for Oracle which was the
84:42 campus next door so she was an awesome
84:45 software engineer who I also worked with
84:48 so I just want to put this episode out
84:50 there get the get the mind kind of
84:52 stirring on what the overall project is
84:55 I do believe it is a hundred percent at
84:57 this stage about controlling drug drug
85:00 importation into the country you know
85:03 you might ask yourself why doesn't the
85:05 president just say that because there is
85:09 a problem with telling the citizens of a
85:11 country that they have an Intelligence
85:13 Agency that a small percentage of I mean
85:17 the number that keeps getting thrown
85:18 around is 3 percent 3 percent of this
85:20 alphabet agency I don't know if that's
85:22 true or not is part of these clandestine
85:24 projects that serve the deep state
85:26 exclusively that little reservoir of
85:31 corruption is being extricated destroyed
85:35 hobbled hopefully as individuals are
85:38 getting arrested and we don't even know
85:39 it
85:39 but hopefully they're part of any band
85:41 of folks that do get arrested once we
85:43 get to that stage right you wonder why
85:48 it's taking a long time to pull these
85:50 people down you know hopefully that
85:51 occurs maybe it doesn't occur but it's
85:54 because the information bubble that
85:56 needs to surround all these individuals
85:58 to incriminate them in the eyes of the
86:00 law it's a big order
86:03 and imagine you're like I want to take
86:05 out these 10 people they're really
86:06 corrupt and I've got them almost dead to
86:09 rights but I'm going to interview a few
86:10 more people and then all of a sudden you
86:12 interview a few more people and the
86:14 amount of people you want to rest is now
86:15 a hundred and so you have more
86:17 indictments and then 100 turns into a
86:19 thousand then 10,000 you know you see
86:21 how that works it turns into this atom
86:24 bomb explosion of indictments and
86:27 individuals that get on a list
86:30 the climate in California in Southern
86:32 California when it comes to meeting
86:35 individuals who are potentially illegal
86:38 immigrants is actually very calm and
86:41 peaceful and respectful you I have never
86:45 seen you see it on you see it on
86:48 Internet videos where someone's on a bus
86:50 and they're yelling at somebody but man
86:52 I've never seen that in my lifetime
86:54 everyone's treated with respect
86:59 you know I know individuals that have to
87:01 get things manufactured and Los Angeles
87:03 is a great place to get things
87:05 manufactured from furniture to clothing
87:07 to all kinds of different things and
87:10 they they know that's being created by
87:13 illegal immigrants and they developed
87:16 these wonderful relationships of these
87:18 people they become part of the family
87:19 and eventually a lot of them get
87:21 citizenship eventually and they're just
87:24 the kind of people that you want in the
87:25 country as they contribute and I think
87:28 that that is the overwhelming majority
87:31 of people who do get into this country
87:33 they really have the hunger to succeed
87:36 and I have a dozen stories of people
87:39 that came into this country that had
87:40 nothing and just the father came over
87:43 and he worked the fields and then the
87:46 dude started owning the fields you know
87:48 and he brought his family up and had a
87:51 bunch of kids and lived a wonderful life
87:54 he didn't do a job that American didn't
87:56 want to do he just was willing to work
87:58 as hard as an American to get it done
88:00 right in any country that's worth its
88:04 salt has to take care of its citizens
88:08 first and once that's done which I don't
88:11 think is that difficult to do I mean
88:14 when you have a lot of corruption it's
88:15 difficult but once you get rid of the
88:16 corruption it's pretty easy to fix it's
88:18 always easy to do to the right thing
88:20 that's what's crazy I watch companies go
88:22 down the tubes constantly and the
88:24 leadership is just incapable of doing
88:27 the right thing because someone doesn't
88:29 have the knowledge on how to do it or
88:30 they have an ego that prevents them from
88:32 doing the right thing right like they
88:36 won't admit they've done anything wrong
88:37 so they can never do anything right so
88:40 that happens too it's a
88:43 it's a multi-stage problem and I think
88:46 you guys realize that if you are for the
88:49 border it's just a semantics of the
88:52 first step the world really does get
88:55 along it does for the most part yes big
88:59 sink big areas of the world are either
89:03 education sanctioned and therefore they
89:06 are in some state of violence is the
89:10 solution for them because they feel like
89:12 there's no other way they have no
89:13 knowledge of another way to solve the
89:15 problem that's not the southern border
89:17 problem right that's in different
89:21 regions of the world as a European
89:22 immigration problem Europe is starting
89:26 to understand the detriment of this
89:29 socialist a global istic program to just
89:32 redistribute everyone around the world
89:34 right it's not the way that we solve
89:36 problems education education education
89:40 right so anyway I know you get me if you
89:46 have them into deep thoughts radio calm
89:47 please go it's where you can change your
89:49 feed from video to audio and audio to
89:51 video there's a lakh Facebook group a
89:52 patreon page and that's it folks take
89:56 care of yourself and someone else and
89:57 I'll see you in the next deep thoughts
89:59 over time
90:00 [Music]
90:11 you
