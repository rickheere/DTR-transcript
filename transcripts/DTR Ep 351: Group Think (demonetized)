00:00 [Music]
00:34 alright ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:36 back to deep thoughts your weather
00:39 update is that we have generally clear
00:42 blue skies no chemtrails natural clouds
00:45 20% chance of raining in the next half
00:48 hour but there's nothing here to rain on
00:51 us so I checked the the Doppler radar
00:54 and the nearish clouds up in Santa
00:57 Barbara which would take at least an
00:59 hour and a half to get down here so I
01:00 think we've got some time to chitchat
01:03 and the show must go on right you have
01:06 so many shows on the queue I don't know
01:08 how they all I'm gonna get them all out
01:09 before the summer arrives plus I'm
01:14 working on the new season one getting it
01:16 all REE mastered I thought today we
01:19 would take a deep dive in what people
01:24 are now referring to as groupthink as
01:29 James deal termed it in Black Sabbath
01:33 mob rules mentality because it's really
01:36 strange I've seen it my whole life
01:38 became super aware of it in the 90s when
01:41 we had product biases it's gonna sound
01:45 silly but the the first place I ever saw
01:48 groupthink become absolutely asinine and
01:51 ridiculous was between the Apple
01:54 operating system in the Windows
01:55 operating system
01:56 having been a kid that grew up into
01:59 operating systems from the late 70s
02:02 early 80s as a really young child when I
02:06 watched these arguments in the in the
02:09 90s and here I was a very young coder I
02:13 dealt with all the direct flaws of both
02:16 platforms but with Apple system 7 which
02:22 was pretty much polished by 1991 we
02:26 could do everything networked computers
02:28 plug-and-play printers I mean it was
02:32 joyous it was a wonderful wonderful
02:34 platform and you get on Windows and it
02:38 was just a [ __ ] nightmare it was like
02:40 everything they said that product could
02:41 do we couldn't do it now Windows it's
02:43 pretty awesome today so I take back that
02:46 judgment as of
02:48 probably seven but I watched in the
02:52 nineties where people were fighting to
02:55 keep an inferior product on top and
02:58 happened in the 80s in a different realm
03:01 between beta and VHS beta was locked
03:05 down by Sony VHS was sort of an American
03:08 open standard VHS was inferior to beta
03:13 for a while and then they kind of caught
03:16 up but I was fixing VCRs as a kid and so
03:19 I would see the picture quality I would
03:22 see the mechanics inside the boxes my
03:25 father was meticulous about audio/video
03:28 quality on the sound side on the video
03:31 side I mean he was studying as much as
03:33 he could and then passing it down to me
03:35 but now it it's a little bit bigger
03:38 right it's not just a product loyalty
03:41 thing it's a political loyalty thing
03:45 it's a how to run a country thing it's
03:50 sort of totally [ __ ] out of control
03:52 isn't it it used to be when I was a kid
03:55 that you had to have some experience in
03:57 what you would outwardly discuss with
03:59 others lest you be deemed an ignorant
04:05 human being that no one would listen to
04:08 you ran your mouth about something you
04:10 had no idea the word got around quick
04:13 this person has no experience in this
04:15 and therefore if they open their mouth
04:19 and talk about this then you need to one
04:22 not listen to him but to realize how
04:24 ignorant this human being is to weigh
04:27 into something that they have no
04:28 experience in period but today because
04:32 we have agendas being towed by deep
04:36 state organizations known as the
04:38 Democratic Party did have all their
04:41 little spinoff subsets all their little
04:45 political movements every single
04:47 political movement underneath that
04:49 sellout organization it just gets worse
04:53 and worse and worse
04:55 you know Maxine Waters running around
04:57 telling every black person in America
05:01 that they're gonna get their 40 acres
05:03 and a mule you know I don't know what's
05:06 worse I mean we know what lying usually
05:09 means to us and that how we treat people
05:11 that lie but to promise people something
05:14 that you know they're never gonna get
05:15 Wow
05:17 that's huge that's a big lie that's a
05:21 big fat lie
05:21 and to extort out of them loyalty to
05:25 your your deep state group by promising
05:28 them something that will never occur it
05:31 just gets worse and worse and worse and
05:33 she's not even the craziest one anymore
05:36 Cortez makes the dumbest [ __ ] on
05:40 planet look like Tesla or Fineman you
05:45 know well what is really behind
05:47 groupthink I've mentioned it several
05:49 times without using the phrase
05:51 groupthink it's really about being on
05:54 the winning team and not knowing really
05:57 anything about life in general when I
06:01 was dealing with technology in the 90s
06:03 it was very easy to understand
06:05 groupthink because you had people like
06:08 you know housewife's and old you know
06:11 accountants that were like two years
06:13 from retiring they knew jack all about
06:15 computers but you get on the phone with
06:17 them and they would tell you why there
06:19 are windows follower it's the best
06:20 operating system and those crashing
06:23 Tosh's and blah blah blah and you're
06:25 just looking at him like you know I live
06:27 in this [ __ ] all day long I programmed
06:29 the [ __ ] product you're using so I
06:31 know how many dragons I had to slay to
06:33 get this [ __ ] thing to work on
06:35 Windows the Mac II just worked it's
06:38 faster it's more efficient you want to
06:40 network your office together so that you
06:42 can kind of get into some communal
06:44 methodology it's easy I was in a company
06:48 that was about 150 people at one point
06:50 in 1991 and 75 of them were across the
06:54 pond in England and Sussex and 75 were
06:57 here in Foster City California which is
07:00 Northern California and we had I don't
07:03 know I think we had like almost a
07:05 hundred computers because some people
07:07 have more than one
07:09 we had no IT group I was IT I ran a
07:13 email server that would phone England
07:17 because it's before the internet was
07:18 made into like a standard thing and you
07:21 know we'd exchange messages this product
07:23 called quick mail install the software
07:25 it's all the operating system no problem
07:27 it was just easy peasy and then this VP
07:31 of Sales guy came in he was a Windows
07:34 diehard
07:35 he wanted his sales staff to have
07:37 windows because he had a contact program
07:40 but he was unwilling to switch over to a
07:43 Macintosh equivalent so all of a sudden
07:46 these laptops come in at like you know
07:49 fifty five hundred bucks a piece
07:52 immediately we had to hire an IT guy and
07:56 then we had to hire another IT guy these
07:59 dudes are making right about $80,000 a
08:02 year if not more hits so it costs the
08:05 company two hundred thousand dollars a
08:09 year in payroll
08:09 that's health care and payroll tax and
08:12 all that stuff to you guys who don't
08:13 have companies understand but it became
08:16 insanely expensive just to maintain like
08:18 five laptops and the computer in the
08:20 business but I get on the phone with
08:22 engineers and they tell me one way or
08:24 the other
08:24 that was funny was the just obsessed on
08:28 this warmer second the super-secret
08:31 government projects that I was double
08:34 blinded in supporting meaning I had no
08:37 idea what the hell they were doing the
08:38 PD told me like fairytale stories about
08:40 what they're doing and I'd have to help
08:41 them program it's kind of funny they all
08:44 use Mac's I said well why is the
08:47 government using Macintosh computers and
08:49 they said because you can't be hacked
08:51 and windows they walk right into those
08:55 are okay cool
08:56 but now there's really two different
08:58 categories to groupthink
09:00 I apologize if you can hear this wind
09:02 it's very windy today it's about 55
09:06 degrees out you might have a situation
09:09 where groupthink is absolutely
09:11 imperative deceiving your society and
09:13 this is something they understand in a
09:15 big big way this fake you know alien
09:18 invasion thing that has been rumored all
09:20 over the internet something I think they
09:21 couldn't pull off
09:22 at least in this day and age maybe in 50
09:26 years they could do it but the idea is
09:28 that the government is it's launched by
09:30 the secretary of verner von braun a lady
09:34 that looks like she would make money
09:35 reading your palm if she didn't have a
09:37 job otherwise supposedly I think she's
09:40 got a PhD or something but she's a
09:43 runner she runs around the internet
09:44 telling everyone that von Braun told her
09:46 but there were plans already in place by
09:48 1978 for the government to stage an
09:52 alien invasion to create a one-world
09:54 government and then Reagan gets up one
09:58 of his first speeches ever on television
10:00 and he says it too what if there was an
10:03 alien invasion we all got into one roof
10:04 hmm well now think about that for a
10:08 second alien invasion zombie apocalypse
10:12 some mega virus that's killing everybody
10:15 in the world - those who probably don't
10:18 cook with microwaves in [ __ ] eat
10:20 fluoride all day maybe we'll survive but
10:24 you would need to groupthink probably
10:27 just to survive but of course if the
10:30 whole thing is compromised if the whole
10:33 thing is a staged event then what I'm
10:36 saying actually comes with a grain of
10:38 salt doesn't it then there's your
10:40 totally in your face manipulated
10:43 groupthink your black lives matter
10:45 movements your overzealous LGBT group
10:50 where everyone's being told that they're
10:52 being repressed there's your feminist
10:54 movements for our females that haven't
10:57 seen what's my line the 17-year run of a
11:02 great show on TV from 1950 to 1967 where
11:07 women were literally documented on TV as
11:10 being treated equal from from Lockheed
11:15 Martin rocket scientists to
11:18 grandmother's in their 60s being
11:20 bouncers at bars to every single career
11:24 eco possum as a woman that ran the
11:25 Israeli Air Force for the female Israeli
11:28 pilots I mean women have been kicking
11:32 ass for a very long time yes we had to
11:35 get voting
11:36 in the suffrage to end but we've been
11:39 doing well for quite a long time but now
11:42 we have something called hashtag walk
11:44 away something that Candace Owens I
11:47 believe refers to as black black sit
11:49 which is get off the plantation get off
11:54 the Democratic created KKK plantation
11:58 all right and let's remind everyone who
12:01 has their delusions the Democrats voted
12:04 against abolishing slavery the Democrats
12:06 voted against blacks having the right to
12:08 vote Democrats voted against black
12:11 people being considered human 1957
12:17 Eisenhower's trying to pass
12:19 desegregation laws Democrats voted
12:22 against that just for most of you who
12:25 don't know Martin Luther King was a
12:28 Republican Democrats started the
12:32 eugenics business that's now known as
12:35 Planned Parenthood to make sure that
12:37 ghettos have plenty of contraceptives
12:40 plenty of free abortion services to make
12:42 sure that anybody in those areas doesn't
12:45 procreate doesn't create babies they
12:49 vote for welfare and a bunch of other
12:50 [ __ ] to make sure that you have no
12:52 self-respect no dignity no integrity you
12:57 just suck in air very funny I was
13:00 posting just a little reply on Instagram
13:04 I recommended that someone take a look
13:07 at Candace Owens she's probably one of
13:10 the greatest gifts to the United States
13:13 of America and probably the world at
13:14 this point but definitely within our
13:16 country and this female black woman
13:22 called her and Uncle Tom because she was
13:26 completely [ __ ] delusional and her
13:28 democratic groupthink worship it was
13:31 interesting this woman was able to
13:32 reverse in her brain what Candice Owens
13:35 is if you ever see Candice Owens speak
13:39 she puts most human beings to shame when
13:43 it comes to being articulate focused and
13:46 just clear minded just unbeli
13:49 she sees the world she sees it and it's
13:52 at its entirety I envy her clarity if I
13:57 could talk as clear as her I'd have a
13:59 million subscribers in a week so they
14:02 know there's two forms of groupthink
14:04 they know there's this highly
14:06 manipulated very costly George Soros you
14:10 know Democratic super PAC groupthink
14:13 which takes literally you have to put
14:16 stacks of cash inside of the
14:17 manipulative kind of black lives matter
14:20 movements this immigration movement
14:23 you've got to put money into it when you
14:24 got to pay for the caravans to come up
14:26 then you got to pay for all the press
14:28 because no one would ever turn the
14:30 channel on and watch that [ __ ]
14:32 electively they have to push cash in to
14:37 make you want to watch it to buy the ads
14:38 so that you'll slip into these things
14:41 pay people off to run down to a Kavanagh
14:45 hearing and pass out money under a tree
14:48 so that you'll have protests inside the
14:51 Cavanaugh court because no one gives a
14:53 [ __ ] about who becomes Supreme Court
14:55 justice in this country I mean it's not
14:57 entirely true of course but the majority
14:59 people have no [ __ ] clue where that
15:01 even sits in the whole judicial branch
15:04 system and the way that they fuel the
15:08 manipulated side of groupthink is to
15:10 also sabotage people's quality of life
15:14 as long as they sabotage your life you
15:18 hate life thus yourself and you're
15:21 willing to scapegoat out and hate other
15:23 people what's interesting is when you're
15:25 not inside the Democratic hate yourself
15:28 hate the world watch everything [ __ ]
15:30 burn [ __ ] mentality when you're
15:34 outside of that I don't mean by it be
15:36 bias or anything but you can see these
15:41 people hate themselves you can see their
15:44 psychosis their schizophrenia you can
15:46 see it but when they're in it you see
15:50 you can't see it you know they believe
15:52 that everything's just you know the
15:55 douchebag that punched the kid in the
15:56 face of Berkeley University Wow
16:00 Wow Chris he wouldn't dare punch someone
16:05 that could knock his ass out he wouldn't
16:07 try that he's got a punch on a guy who
16:10 probably never been a fistfight in his
16:12 life someone who's gonna take a punch
16:15 bend down and not throw a punch back god
16:19 bless that guy for taking that hit but
16:21 Jesus Christ some of us have scrapped
16:25 that [ __ ] into the ground let me
16:27 tell you the guys all proud of himself
16:28 that guy who punched that dude in in
16:32 Berkeley if there's any normal
16:35 development to society he's gonna be one
16:37 of these guys on a History Channel thank
16:40 20 years from now just like the white
16:42 people that yelled at black people when
16:43 they were trying to come into white
16:44 schools back in the 60s there's that
16:47 famous woman who yelled at the black
16:48 girl she was in her teens yelling at a
16:51 girl on her teens don't her to go back
16:53 to Africa or whatever she said was
16:55 something horrible and then she weeped
16:57 on a History Channel special later
17:01 because she realized how ridiculous and
17:02 indoctrinated she was I will tell you
17:05 unequivocally if the guy doesn't change
17:08 his mind like that he will be a complete
17:10 and utter [ __ ] failure in his life
17:12 just keep tabs on the guy ten years from
17:15 now if he hasn't changed his opinion and
17:16 figured out that he was on the wrong
17:17 side whatever he's doing is something
17:20 pathetic
17:22 20 years agos by I'd be surprised the
17:25 dudes alive now what's interesting about
17:26 these two groups right again we have
17:29 this sort of apocalyptic groupthink that
17:34 can be turned on and a second of panic
17:36 and this happened after 9/11 right this
17:41 crazy [ __ ] happens in New York and
17:44 Washington I mean every single flight in
17:47 America was shut off first time in the
17:51 history of America where all the planes
17:53 were grounded they knew exactly who the
17:56 [ __ ] did it they did it it was for some
17:59 neocon agenda we're all I was in it I
18:02 mean I was in groupthink like I said in
18:05 a episode a long time ago there was a
18:07 guy driving around the neighborhood
18:08 right after that and he had a sign on
18:11 the front of his truck said Newcombe
18:13 and I was right there complete [ __ ]
18:16 idiot just buying it hadn't remotely
18:19 become woke as they say later on I was
18:24 ashamed how gullible I was what's nice
18:29 about the manipulative groupthink is
18:32 that we actually have a defense
18:33 mechanism we can put in place which is
18:35 the cue and on movement our own little
18:38 videos talking to each other someone
18:40 comes in saying you know misquoting
18:42 statistics of police officers attacking
18:45 minorities and then the minorities come
18:47 in like Candace Owens and go that's not
18:49 true and some folks just go by cut like
18:52 Chris Rock sold thing on on HBO he said
18:55 you know you want to you want to end
18:57 police brutality goes stop breaking the
18:59 [ __ ] law now there's a lot of
19:01 elements to why people do that now I
19:03 understand that but it's just kind of
19:04 funny but the statistics are always
19:07 reported incorrectly to create these
19:09 false narratives that things are
19:10 happening that are not happening
19:12 but then become this you know was it
19:16 Kirkpatrick out of the [ __ ] his name is
19:17 together wears socks that have pigs on
19:21 them dressed like police officers there
19:25 and so it's obviously [ __ ] the police
19:27 kind of thing this reminds me of that
19:30 comedian back in the 80s baseball or
19:32 football is my life yeah for me anyone
19:35 kneeling at these games I mean you just
19:39 got to put a Scarlet Letter on them in
19:41 your head just like stupid stupid stupid
19:44 they're not even ignorant anymore they
19:46 have been presented many opportunities
19:49 to get educated on the situation and
19:51 they're kneeling and again the last
19:53 Democrat I talked to at a party it was
19:55 all for this kneeling horse showed us so
19:57 well why are they [ __ ] kneeling no
20:00 black lives matter it's like dude you're
20:04 white or you virtually signalling to me
20:06 at a [ __ ] party the guy was a
20:09 complete [ __ ] alcoholic to go [ __ ]
20:12 figure right but again we can install
20:15 governor's inside of this other
20:19 methodology of groupthink people want to
20:22 be on the winning team and so as long as
20:26 there's a narrative
20:27 that's the winning team then they jump
20:29 on board why because there are [ __ ]
20:31 cowards some of them are good people but
20:35 you know you wonder how all of these
20:37 celebrities have been able to molest
20:39 children because the parents when a star
20:42 [ __ ] the people that are [ __ ] their
20:44 kids you know people forget Corey Haims
20:47 Corey Haims was the buddy of Corey
20:49 Feldman
20:51 he was so mistreated as a young man that
20:56 he couldn't deal with it
20:57 he had to use drugs and alcohol so he
21:00 could deal with the memories that were
21:01 still very sharp in his mind he had been
21:04 taken advantage of and as a man you
21:07 don't want that to be your your past at
21:10 least as a child you can't frame that in
21:12 your head and so he commits suicide but
21:15 most of these kids have these wacky ass
21:17 parents don't they all these childhood
21:20 stars when they started looking at the
21:22 parents the parents are literally
21:23 running off in two different directions
21:25 almost all of them get divorced
21:26 immediately soon as their kid makes it
21:29 dad's like [ __ ] this I'm gonna screw a
21:30 bunch of young girls and the moms like
21:32 what the hell I guess I'll do the same
21:34 whatever the zombunny Ramses oh my god
21:38 dad's a pedophile probably a child
21:41 trafficker running all over the world
21:43 most likely kills his daughter can't
21:46 find her can't find until the police
21:47 come over oh I found her in the basement
21:50 up you know she's all tied up and all
21:52 this other crap he's paying girls and
21:54 Amsterdam to dress like his daughter so
21:58 gonna have sex with him guys go Scott
22:02 [ __ ] free the moms obviously involved
22:05 in some sex cult thing as well because
22:07 she covered for him does that woman who
22:10 does body language reads on YouTube
22:12 she's phenomenal
22:14 I mean phenomenal when she well I would
22:18 love to see her do a body language on
22:20 the the Ramseys way back in the 80s when
22:22 this kid died but I mean look at the the
22:26 weird obsession with these parents that
22:28 put their kids in these beauty pageants
22:29 dressing up little tiny girls to look
22:32 like sexy adults that's what they're
22:35 trying to do they want to be on a
22:37 winning team mommy didn't get a chance
22:40 to be
22:41 pretty in front of other people so or
22:43 maybe she did but she didn't get enough
22:45 so she pushes her kid into it
22:47 here come the vultures it's just like a
22:50 shopping mall catalog the kids I like
22:53 thank you you know what you put a bit on
22:55 that I hear parents don't understand
22:57 putting your kids all over social media
22:59 you're insane you're [ __ ] insane I
23:03 mean maybe they have some protection now
23:06 the Trump's president and he's been
23:07 going after pedophiles on a level that
23:08 is absolutely historical but seriously
23:12 they just go through Facebook can pick
23:14 your kid you have no idea they exist
23:17 maybe they're in Monaco maybe they're in
23:19 there across the United States or in
23:21 Europe or whatever and they just come
23:23 get your kid some people come get your
23:25 kid and they just pay a few million
23:27 bucks or whatever whatever it would take
23:29 there you go sir
23:31 you kid disappears ends up on a milk
23:33 carton i rethink that mom and dad for
23:36 computers it was interesting and I know
23:38 it sounds like a trivial way to approach
23:40 this but think about the fear and
23:43 anxiety that went into people's hearts
23:45 who were probably in their 30s or older
23:48 in the nineties when here comes a
23:50 computer and they've been doing
23:51 everything by hand on a piece of paper
23:54 they're terrified of the keyboard they
23:57 think they're gonna push a little key
23:58 combination hit in here and the [ __ ]
24:00 missiles gonna launch somewhere in bomb
24:02 another country because they saw the
24:03 movie wargames back in the 80s and so
24:06 their anxiety was quashed by the very
24:10 first person they talked to when they
24:13 asked the question what computer should
24:14 I buy which one's better uh you get some
24:17 nerd who can't figure out well he can't
24:20 be important taking care of a Macintosh
24:21 because no one needs his [ __ ] help
24:23 and so Windows was so goddamn convoluted
24:26 the nerd was in charge but you need me
24:27 for everything you can't [ __ ] connect
24:29 this to a printer you want to network
24:31 this stuff together it's absolutely
24:32 possible so I'll get it done and you'll
24:36 feel I'll feel smart and in control and
24:38 you feel like you got the right guy at
24:40 the helm so there goes the loyalty and
24:44 it was nonsensical irrational and that's
24:48 usually how political parties are chosen
24:49 right I watched a great video that was
24:52 linked by Q for the walk away movement
24:55 the first gentleman that spoke I think
24:58 it's safe to say he's part of the LGBT
25:00 community beautiful speech man totally
25:03 articulate talked about the intolerance
25:06 within his former party the Democratic
25:08 Party and then he concludes and it goes
25:11 into a collage like a montage of
25:14 probably I don't know about ten black
25:19 Americans male and female evenly
25:21 distributed and they went through all of
25:23 their reasons and their research as to
25:27 why they decided to pull out but they
25:30 were indoctrinated into the system
25:33 because just like that phone call that
25:34 someone might have made in the 90s to
25:36 figure out what operating system was the
25:37 right operating system a lot of these
25:39 people were raised from birth we're
25:42 black you got to be Democrat they're the
25:44 ones that fight for us I mean imagine if
25:46 they had taught a class that says the
25:49 KKK it's all uh Jim Crow Democrat
25:55 created things Hillary Clinton who was
25:59 the she worshipped senator Byrd I guess
26:05 his name he's one of the head Ku Klux
26:08 Klan guys LBJ was a white knight
26:12 Democrat white was the color of their
26:16 sheet okay total white supremacist
26:18 organization so a lot of this is
26:21 breaking down for them this pay-to-play
26:24 racism and intolerance and hatred is
26:28 starting to fade away so either they're
26:31 gonna have to double down their
26:32 investment on this stuff and a lot of
26:35 their assets are being seized I mean
26:37 when's the last time you heard George
26:38 Soros putting ten billion dollars into a
26:41 movement supposedly he gave away all of
26:44 his money it could be that it got seized
26:47 it's gonna be that dudes dead he was at
26:50 the he was at a particular time in place
26:51 October last year where a helicopter
26:53 crash happened and I haven't seen any
26:56 live video of the guy since then they do
26:58 say he's showing up and doing things but
27:00 well it's the time when you explore the
27:02 pictures are pretty [ __ ] old pictures
27:03 before October 2018 they can't really
27:07 pull the alien invasion thing
27:09 because no one's involved no one's gonna
27:11 take that risk
27:13 you know Trump's not gonna go along with
27:15 the alien invasion thing spreading a
27:17 virus hmm I suppose they could
27:20 potentially do that I'm sure that there
27:24 are certain labs that have copies of
27:26 horrible things but isn't interesting
27:29 that those things haven't occurred I
27:31 would think that the second that Hillary
27:33 lost and that when the five eyes are
27:37 getting their pupils poked out they
27:39 would just go nuts and drop this kind of
27:42 thing then again the world has checks
27:44 and balances right as much as countries
27:46 might work together for sharing Intel
27:48 illegally on each other or legally but
27:51 obviously illegal in the eyes of the
27:53 people if they really knew what was
27:54 going on they're still not willing to
27:56 say oh yeah drop that virus and kill my
27:58 family kill me because the thing is is
28:01 less you get inoculated from some of
28:03 these viruses which you know let me
28:05 remind any politician watching you could
28:08 get a placebo and you're dead you don't
28:13 know you don't know if you're immune you
28:16 really want to test that out live plenty
28:19 of you who study binary weapons a binary
28:23 weapon is a weapon where you give an
28:27 animal or a human being and a component
28:31 of chemistry an aerosol spray that comes
28:35 out of the sky something in the water
28:36 supply something in the food supply you
28:39 merely get it into the body and it
28:40 manifests like a virus but you're okay
28:42 no problem you don't catch the flu you
28:44 don't feel any negative symptoms but you
28:48 have this a in you for the rest of your
28:49 life because your body will help it
28:51 procreate and then they drop a B and
28:55 you're dead you bleed out of every
28:59 orifice in your body until you're dead
29:03 well that's why I think that when planes
29:07 leave trails in the sky they turn into
29:10 these you know super shiny non moisture
29:15 base clouds right a cloud is always a
29:18 hue of gray I got a bunch over there in
29:21 my left
29:22 they're always no matter how shiny a
29:24 popcorn Thunder cap is there's a bunch
29:28 of gray in it because it's absorbing
29:29 light because it is a cloud made of
29:31 moisture what do they tell you Kym
29:33 contrails are or chemtrails they see
29:35 their contrails well contrails always
29:38 disappear within 10 to 15 seconds behind
29:41 a point chemtrails turn into these
29:43 [ __ ] gigantic filet-o-fish things in
29:46 the sky and they never have a hue of
29:48 gray because they are reflecting all the
29:50 light because they aluminum oxide and
29:52 barium oxide among other things if
29:55 you're desensitized to an aerosol
29:58 program all over your country then they
30:03 have a mechanism to drop an A&B on you
30:05 and you're just gonna think it's where
30:07 clouds come from which is why that has
30:09 to stop if you have a strong mind and
30:12 you can say I do not suffer from peer
30:14 pressure groupthink is not going to be a
30:17 problem you've probably ever felt in
30:18 your life if you get educated on things
30:22 and I mean you go to alternate history
30:25 because the history that we have been
30:26 told in most cases is completely
30:28 completely fraudulent you know why we
30:31 fought the civil war what Lincoln was
30:33 all about how why how and why Lincoln
30:35 was murdered same with JFK saying the
30:38 reasons why we started all the world
30:39 wars since the revolution that's a good
30:43 start how money is created how
30:45 fractional reserve banking works who is
30:47 the Federal Reserve what's a lobbyist
30:50 what's a banker what are these you know
30:54 backstabbing [ __ ] communists ik said
30:58 you know treasonous people like Nancy
31:01 Pelosi and Adam shift and Maxine Waters
31:04 and Cortez and Schumer's Muellers and
31:08 commis and all these people once you get
31:12 educated and you can see the devil for
31:14 who they are
31:15 life is good but now there's an
31:19 interesting thing going on a group think
31:20 because the queue and on movement has
31:24 groupthink they have control mechanisms
31:28 within the ei-chan boards used to be
31:30 4chan boards so you'll hear me reference
31:32 the the wrong board nowadays because
31:34 they've switched over
31:36 what do they say they say trust the plan
31:39 theologically some of that [ __ ] is they
31:41 say trust the plan one of our listeners
31:43 Cavs posted a great list of things that
31:46 are still going on that are seemingly
31:49 unchecked does it seem to be any plans
31:52 to fix some of these things now some of
31:53 these things are on Q's list and they're
31:55 in the movies and you know it's things
31:57 that can't be fixed overnight so we'll
32:00 see what happens but he made a great
32:01 list that we should use as a sort of a
32:04 checksum against a fraudulent movement
32:07 but if you come in and you express any
32:11 doubt as to Q's authenticity the actual
32:15 accomplishments of what he is saying is
32:17 going to happen then they they actually
32:20 and pardon the expression they have a
32:25 saying on this board which should no no
32:28 should concern you a little bit they
32:31 call you a new [ __ ] because you're new to
32:34 the board you're new to the movement and
32:35 you're being you're being doubtful and
32:39 you're not to be doubtful you're to
32:40 trust the plan you're to be a complete
32:42 [ __ ] idiot you're to be a lemming
32:44 that just you know there's a bunch of
32:46 [ __ ] that lemmings jump off cliffs
32:49 the Disney organization forged that
32:52 reality that lemmings follow each other
32:55 off a cliff it's [ __ ] but that video
32:56 game was a lot of fun back in the what
32:58 is it 90s but if you descent they'll say
33:00 you know they just call you a bunch of
33:02 names right away you're a doubter it's
33:05 like look man right now Q is just
33:08 basically reading me the [ __ ] news
33:10 and linking me to people's Twitter posts
33:12 that are kind of rah rah
33:14 all I want is results I don't give a
33:16 [ __ ] about anything else if you ran a
33:18 big giant corporation like the Trump
33:20 Organization all you care about is
33:23 results you imagine Trump building some
33:26 property in New York and some Foreman
33:29 comes in or some person who's
33:30 responsible for working the status of a
33:32 particular build and all they do is blow
33:35 smoke up his ass but the building isn't
33:37 going up what would he do I don't give a
33:42 [ __ ] about your [ __ ] grand kids today
33:44 I mean I care about them but Christ I'm
33:46 talking about a building don't try to
33:49 and don't give me a bunch of [ __ ]
33:50 because all I want to do is hear how my
33:53 buildings doing how my money's being
33:54 spent when I can get this [ __ ] place
33:57 open so I can generate some cash for my
33:59 company I'm in a business here but if
34:03 Trump Towers was trying to build
34:05 something and it was a cube movement
34:07 group showing up to give him the status
34:10 on his building and he's remotely upset
34:14 about the fact he can't get a status on
34:15 anything that they keep telling him how
34:17 great the building is gonna be but
34:18 they're not building it they call him a
34:21 new [ __ ]
34:23 trust the plan mr. Trump yeah really the
34:26 plan is to build the [ __ ] building
34:28 not to talk about building the building
34:30 not to guarantee me how great it's gonna
34:32 be once it's built build it or shut the
34:34 [ __ ] up so that's part of the Q movement
34:37 that's actually very fairly regrettable
34:38 q hasn't taken any time out to talk to
34:41 doubters in a way that's respectful at
34:43 least in my memory or someone says you
34:47 know hey dude you said that this stuff
34:49 was gonna happen all Q ever does is say
34:51 I didn't say I didn't say that like yeah
34:54 you did dude you completely insinuated
34:56 it I mean if if this was a date that you
34:59 were going on that would be the partner
35:01 that you're taking back home has given
35:03 you every indication whispered in your
35:05 ear done absolutely everything to
35:06 indicate that you're gonna have a
35:08 romantic engagement a physical exchange
35:10 when you get home and Q will just I
35:14 don't know walk out two minutes after
35:16 walking in and then when you're like hey
35:19 I thought we were gonna do something I
35:20 didn't sue though well yeah we didn't
35:23 sit at the nightclub talking about
35:25 exactly what maneuvers were gonna do at
35:26 home but you certainly sent the signals
35:28 that's cute
35:30 he may be legit and again he's helping
35:33 everyone wake up so there's a big
35:35 benefit regardless that the guy's fake
35:36 or not we keep hearing about everyone
35:38 going to jail and all these indictments
35:40 and how you know history books are gonna
35:42 be written about these first two years
35:44 all right
35:46 well currently there's nothing to write
35:48 about in these first two years besides a
35:50 movement that's fairly interesting it
35:53 would be the next three and four years
35:55 of Trump's presidency that has a chance
35:57 of impressing any of us and even if they
36:01 do every single thing that they say
36:02 they're gonna do
36:03 I think this criticism of the movement
36:06 is legit no matter what but I'm sure
36:09 it's a very tough thing to do regardless
36:11 so where are some of the groupthink
36:14 groups that we need to be concerned
36:17 about in my opinion climate change go
36:22 see my episode on global warming it's a
36:25 very important thing to pull your head
36:28 out of it's a bunch of lies it's based
36:31 on a bunch of lies
36:33 by a bunch of scientists that quite
36:35 frankly should be forbidden from
36:38 teaching should be forbidden from ever
36:41 getting a grant from any any
36:43 organization at all it'd be like being
36:45 disbarred because you've manipulated
36:47 society into a draconian climate
36:52 taxation thing when there's no science
36:55 to back up any of their [ __ ] instead
36:57 of having an intelligent conversation
36:59 about overpopulation and making sure
37:01 that we don't do that because we haven't
37:03 done it yet they're off lying to us on
37:06 the side treating us like idiots and
37:08 trying to profit from it at the same
37:10 time vaccinations boy are they pushing
37:13 vaccinations like [ __ ] crazy right
37:16 now these stories where one guy ends up
37:20 dying of measles are almost dying of
37:22 measles and so he's he's out there you
37:26 know
37:26 champing championing vaccines by the way
37:30 there's a German doctor out there that
37:32 says that he's been to court several
37:34 times and he says the measles doesn't
37:36 exist that it was a bunch of other
37:38 incidental things that are going wrong
37:40 in your life to give you these symptoms
37:43 that are measles and it's curable not a
37:47 problem
37:47 they said I read an article this morning
37:49 that said that a kid racked up somehow
37:52 like an eight hundred and fifty thousand
37:54 dollar bill because he didn't because he
37:57 didn't respond to he didn't get
37:59 vaccinated against tetanus what does it
38:01 have to do with vaccinations I mean
38:03 seriously you step on a nail you go to
38:06 the hospital you get a tetanus shot to
38:08 prevent lockjaw and a bunch of other
38:10 horrible [ __ ] happening to you it's just
38:12 what happens I've been on several
38:14 construction sites of people
38:16 building their homes they step on a nail
38:18 they're not quite sure one of my good
38:20 friends was messing around and put a
38:22 nail through the bottom of his foot took
38:25 him in to get a tetanus shot and he was
38:26 fine it's not something the whole
38:28 [ __ ] world needs to do
38:29 hey you step on a nail you cut yourself
38:32 with something rusty go get your ass a
38:34 tetanus shot trust me it's way better
38:37 than getting lockjaw they're giving
38:39 people to all these live viruses i mean
38:42 ii in Southern California where I live
38:45 in Orange County
38:46 the second that all these vaccinations
38:47 went out for flu every single human
38:50 being that got the flu shot got the flu
38:52 really bad and then they started
38:53 spreading it to their family members one
38:56 of my good friends went to a meeting the
38:58 dude was totally sick across the room
39:00 just have been vaccinated walks out of
39:03 the place pukes in a goddamn trashcan
39:05 and then she got the flu for like a week
39:09 and a half and it was horrible they're
39:12 spreading the virus and then they're
39:14 causing the panic to go in and buy the
39:17 vaccination and what's really asinine
39:20 about these arguments for vaccination
39:22 cysts we didn't have this [ __ ] a long
39:23 time ago and everything was fine
39:25 yeah polio went through and was a
39:29 problem of of not being sanitized begin
39:33 running water in every single home and
39:37 in filtration and sanitation of water in
39:40 in towns and cities in the United States
39:43 of America was not complete in its first
39:45 phase until 1943 so of course Roosevelt
39:49 caught this [ __ ] and became
39:51 wheelchair-bound a bunch of other kids
39:53 but remember what is it the 850 kids
39:55 that got a polio shot or polio
39:57 vaccination shot all died of polio
39:59 unreal when I was a kid you just caught
40:03 chickenpox big [ __ ] deal parents took
40:06 their kids to chicken pock parties so
40:08 they would get it I got one on my ankle
40:10 then I got chicken pox and then I was
40:12 done was over people get the vaccination
40:15 for chicken pox end up getting shingles
40:17 really bad or chicken pox later because
40:20 the strand they get is a really weak
40:22 strand and it doesn't do anything and
40:24 you shouldn't do it one of my old bosses
40:26 again he was in his 30s and he got
40:28 massive
40:29 chicken pox and he was Latin so his skin
40:31 had that James Olmos you know memory and
40:34 a poor guy he went to I went to lunch
40:36 with him and he looking at his face um
40:38 he's recovered but he has just had these
40:40 craters all over his face I mean all
40:42 over and he said well you could probably
40:45 see that I'm look different and he goes
40:47 I caught the chickenpox and it was
40:48 horrible and it's taken me six months to
40:51 get to where you see me today hmm I
40:55 didn't have the word with Annette was
40:57 working in pharmaceuticals at the time I
40:59 didn't have this vaccination thing
41:01 hadn't really caught on to the degree it
41:03 is today so I didn't ask him if he was
41:06 recently vaccinated socialism against
41:11 socialism is just an extension a softer
41:13 word for communism even Russia left
41:18 communism behind China is probably the
41:21 only country that is trying to in some
41:23 way hang on to an element of communism
41:26 but even China is breaking out into a
41:28 free market they're just doing it very
41:30 slowly so they don't lose control and
41:33 have chaos in their country with
41:36 communism and socialism you have
41:38 something called payoffs if you want
41:41 anything done you got to grease a palm
41:42 and that's how they run their society
41:45 and they're not bashful about it so you
41:47 want to build a big company in China you
41:49 better find some government officials
41:50 they're gonna take care of your permits
41:52 and you got to give them millions of
41:54 dollars if not more
41:56 at least they're upfront about it but in
42:02 America and Europe best be careful to an
42:06 extent there's group think about
42:07 monarchies still existing on this planet
42:09 again one of my good friends I'll just
42:12 say he's from Europe to conceal his
42:15 identity in this observation he said
42:17 only the stupid people in our country
42:20 believe in monarchs anyone with a brain
42:24 can't stand them I mean it's not like
42:27 they feel like these people should be
42:28 you know put in jail or anything but
42:32 they're just like we just they just need
42:33 to be a family off to the side just like
42:35 any family that's rich they just need to
42:36 be off to the side and have nothing to
42:38 do with the way that our world is
42:41 controlled now the idea
42:43 we need to pull back from this whole
42:45 thing and say well is there ever going
42:46 to be an L of an a time in the history
42:49 of a man of mankind in general where
42:51 groupthink is going to be okay well if
42:56 you look up the definition and I did
42:58 before I did this episode because I
42:59 thought I think I totally understand
43:01 what the concepts about but there was a
43:04 little second sentence to the definition
43:06 I was not aware of which is that it I
43:09 should have known but the definition has
43:13 sort of the clinical a bunch of people
43:15 thinking the same and then the second
43:17 half of the definition is it is a way of
43:20 thinking that prohibits the individual
43:23 from thinking individually away from the
43:26 group of course or group shame on me for
43:31 not just immediately seeing that but now
43:34 what if we got to Gene Roddenberry's
43:37 version of the world and I did an
43:39 episode on Star Trek which I'm very
43:40 proud of that really talks about the
43:43 Gene Roddenberry world and the fact that
43:45 I think he came up with a beautiful
43:47 definition of how the world should work
43:53 but what if we got it right is it okay
43:57 to to be groupthink about freedom
44:01 common-law treating people right being
44:06 tolerant of everyone and I mean really
44:08 tolerant not the Democratic fake [ __ ]
44:10 tolerance where they [ __ ] hate
44:11 everybody and themselves I think it's
44:14 absolutely fabulous when I hear these
44:16 videos like the one that Q posted about
44:18 the lock away movement and all of these
44:21 black Americans go to Republican
44:24 conventions they're megawhatts and they
44:27 walk in expecting racism because that's
44:30 what they've been told it was going to
44:31 happen and all they get is big giant
44:34 hugs and smiles and people you know
44:37 please sit next to me right in the front
44:40 row and they're like oh my god this
44:44 world isn't what they said it was it's a
44:47 good place now it's that second half of
44:50 the definition that concerns me even in
44:52 a giant gene roddenberry world now if
44:56 you remember
44:57 watching and I'm gonna go for the Star
44:59 Trek fictional thing to illustrate a
45:01 point potentially in our future but if
45:03 you watch the series Voyager the way
45:09 that this series starts out is that
45:12 there's the the Maquis the Maquis is
45:16 this rebellion group that doesn't like
45:18 the Federation it's even full of
45:21 Federation people former Federation top
45:25 guns are in there because they have been
45:29 disenfranchised from the main group and
45:32 so when the ship and the Maquis get
45:35 caught in this I don't know what the
45:39 hell you call it but they got moves
45:41 what 75 light-years away from Earth and
45:44 now they got a haul ass back to earth
45:46 and it's gonna take 75 years to get home
45:48 at maximum warp which means it's gonna
45:50 take a hell of a lot longer than 75
45:51 years they had to kind of make peace
45:54 with each other and then in a beautiful
45:57 turn from the writers Chakotay who was
46:01 in charge of the Maquis at the time
46:02 becomes Janeway's number one so the
46:06 captain takes one of them and makes him
46:08 her number one second-in-command and
46:12 he's able to see that he was delusional
46:16 in his Maquis ways that the Federation
46:18 wasn't what he thought it was but he
46:21 still has renegade Maquis that are
46:24 beautifully written throughout the
46:25 entire show I mean it that that's just a
46:28 great series when I first watched
46:29 Voyager as I mentioned in the Star Trek
46:31 series I the first episode made me puke
46:34 in my mouth and then I just stopped
46:37 watching it and then I got into Netflix
46:38 and were you watched all of next
46:40 generation well first I watched the
46:42 original two or three times and they
46:43 remastered it then I got into the next
46:45 generation then Deep Space nine then
46:47 Voyager and then Enterprise each one of
46:50 them is a gym for the mind it's
46:52 beautiful but what makes a group go
46:55 south let's say we get the gene
46:58 roddenberry thing going there's no more
47:00 money we simply work because this is
47:02 what we think we need to do for society
47:06 people make food because we need to eat
47:09 food people dig ditches because we
47:11 [ __ ] they build spaceships they do
47:13 whatever this depends on the individual
47:16 and kind of how much they want to burden
47:17 themselves with their work versus maybe
47:19 start a restaurant Louisiana which is
47:24 one of the professions of Cisco's father
47:27 in Deep Space nine still had totally
47:31 normal human beings that weren't space
47:33 cadets I think that I'll probably always
47:37 be the case we got guys and gals walking
47:39 around this world in the 21st century
47:41 that probably should be in the 18th or
47:45 the 19th century I mean there are
47:46 Cowboys they're cowgirls they want a
47:49 simple life they just want to have kids
47:50 maybe plow a crop raise some livestock
47:55 whatever carve some wood so how does it
47:58 go bat well it goes bad because we have
48:01 one weird unchecked person in power
48:05 there at the tippy top instead of having
48:08 a round table with the King Arthur he
48:12 was clearly [ __ ] in charge it'd be a
48:14 round table with nobody and clearly in
48:16 charge everyone is a communal group of
48:20 folks and we've had this happen what do
48:22 you think China is what do you think the
48:24 USSR was what do you think the super
48:28 PACs are here in the United States and
48:30 the neocons and all these signal
48:32 Burzynski you know after births they're
48:37 colluding together they're colluding
48:40 together in a negative way because they
48:43 don't believe in God for sure for sure
48:45 there's no [ __ ] belief in the
48:47 afterlife they bought into the secular
48:49 [ __ ]
48:50 had to close their minds literally take
48:52 their intelligence and just stomp it out
48:54 like a flame and then they think there's
48:58 no repercussions for screwing mankind or
49:01 perhaps someone you know like analysis
49:03 or Crowley has written a little Bible
49:05 that no one has read and it says you
49:07 know here's why you can do this this is
49:09 what God wants you to do because
49:10 obviously God created the devil if God
49:12 exists he needs negative and positive so
49:14 you can have choice and a someone's got
49:16 to take up the reigns of chaos so that
49:19 these other folks can feel comfortable
49:20 with having gained order their house of
49:23 red that's how it goes
49:25 and the founders of the United States of
49:27 America which were all very masonic
49:29 individuals a lot of more slave owners
49:31 unfortunately and you know I don't know
49:34 what to think about the statement that
49:36 when some people say well some people
49:38 own slaves but they treated them
49:40 wonderfully they fed them let them get
49:43 educated dressed them well gave them
49:45 anything that they needed I can't
49:48 confirm any of that it certainly looks
49:50 like in some of the photographs that
49:52 there are some very well treated folks
49:55 that were property of other people it's
49:58 hard for me to go oh well then that's ok
50:00 no once you tell someone they're owned
50:03 by another person you disembody their
50:06 ability to think that they are an
50:08 individual now if you give them a choice
50:11 and just say this is just a job man this
50:13 is just a job and you seem to do it very
50:15 very well I've got a great benefits
50:17 package you can live on my property I've
50:19 got a great house for you we're gonna
50:21 address you in beautiful suits and
50:23 dresses every single day and you partake
50:25 of the food we partake of and that's
50:28 that type of environment I would totally
50:30 approve of that and that's cool that's a
50:31 normal kind of world especially if
50:34 education was a part of the benefits
50:35 package you can educate yourself and
50:37 become the president United States you
50:40 can educate yourself and become an
50:41 amazing inventor but there seems to be
50:44 sort of this it's it's hard to reconcile
50:47 for someone like myself because I don't
50:48 have the true history of the events but
50:51 they seem to have founded America on
50:53 this notion that government should stay
50:55 extremely small its main you know
50:59 purpose is to handle International
51:01 Affairs and the basic infrastructure of
51:03 laws that we all agree on through voting
51:07 you know I think voting for a law that
51:10 the whole country is going to follow
51:13 should be not 2/3 but probably 3/4 of
51:17 the population needs to vote on a
51:19 particular law and decide whether or not
51:21 that's something we all want to do
51:24 probably through the electoral college
51:26 because the Midwest doesn't have enough
51:29 people to fight against the coast that
51:31 overpopulate I firmly believe as
51:33 probably most of you believe this sort
51:37 of
51:38 you know all that all the methods of
51:41 governing people that has been presented
51:44 by political scientists philosophers and
51:48 anyone who's ever dealt with that
51:49 chieftain responsibility everything
51:52 needs to be put back on the table so we
51:55 can look at it again so that we can
51:58 build a system that is that has
52:00 fail-safes that has full transparency
52:02 and this might sound completely asinine
52:06 because it's so obvious but where do we
52:11 have this lack of transparency in the
52:14 world and I've mentioned it several
52:15 times on many shows and I think it's
52:18 with national security well why does
52:22 national security even exist why is that
52:26 subject matter on the table because the
52:29 bankers who contribute to most of the
52:33 destruction of this planet
52:35 they are almost unanimously behind every
52:40 movement to say Christians should hate
52:42 Arabs Arabs and Christians etc such or
52:47 every other combination on planet earth
52:48 it's all being funded and educated into
52:51 the minds of human beings and so when
52:54 you perceive a threat you then
52:56 immediately validate national security
52:59 methodologies of hiding the truth so
53:02 instead of trying to fix the problem
53:03 from the problem back to the symptom
53:06 you've got to educate the world disable
53:10 these organizations and individuals like
53:13 George Soros that would finance dissent
53:16 in the world and we have to fix each
53:19 individual country and it doesn't mean
53:21 that a group of people won't lose their
53:22 minds and groupthink themselves into
53:25 some racial superiority and try to take
53:28 over regions of the world if not the
53:30 entire world but at least they would
53:32 stick out like a sore thumb but this
53:35 sort of order through discipline meaning
53:40 everyone builds a big giant army and
53:42 says well I got nukes well I got news
53:44 too and you
53:45 you know I got stealth planes well I got
53:47 stealth planes and and just continuing
53:49 that algorithm until the point we burn
53:51 the whole place down blow the whole
53:52 planet up obviously that's a ridiculous
53:55 way of living and if you need a an
53:57 analogy to compare that to imagine
54:00 running your family the way that we run
54:02 the world you're threatening your
54:06 children they're threatening your spouse
54:07 and everyone's living in is just a
54:10 horrible bubble of fear constantly and
54:12 the children would be hiding their
54:14 intent and so with the parents because
54:17 that's a matter of national security
54:18 within their own halos I can't tell my
54:21 dad what I want to can't tell my mom
54:22 what I want I can't tell my wife what I
54:24 want can't tell my husband what I want
54:27 because that would reveal my hand and
54:30 it's a matter of matter of home security
54:32 you know it's a hell of a thing to have
54:34 something like groupthink in your mind
54:36 and to know it exists because it's very
54:38 difficult to control such a thing isn't
54:40 it because it's not you if you just
54:44 waved a magic wand the world would be a
54:46 better place most likely but it doesn't
54:48 work like that does it I've had plenty
54:50 of conversations with grown adults where
54:54 they shut the conversation down some
54:58 actually respect because they shut the
55:00 conversation down with those specific
55:01 words I can't hear any more of this I
55:04 don't want to hear that I don't want to
55:06 see that again well at least I know
55:09 where they stand
55:11 then there's the folks that stopped
55:15 listening to you and they do it secretly
55:17 and again I'm not I'm not of the belief
55:20 that anyone has to listen everything I
55:21 have to say and that's why I don't
55:22 really put that out there except for my
55:25 closest friends that seem to have sort
55:27 of a morbid interest in what's going
55:29 wrong in the world which is just
55:31 something you have to do sometimes if
55:33 you want to have your skin in the game
55:34 and fix the world again like I say
55:36 several times then everybody has to be
55:38 involved with the fix but then what's
55:40 that turn them into a serf of whatever
55:43 organization that they feel affiliated
55:47 with and again I've seen in just this
55:49 last year probably last eight months a
55:52 friend of mine who is by any means a
55:58 Democrat is not an extreme progressive
56:02 person you know he's not like the crazy
56:04 which is just a very small group of
56:07 people but the problem is they're in
56:08 charge they have the money they create
56:12 these groups with with which incubate
56:14 the disenfranchised you know but when I
56:18 met him and I've probably known him for
56:19 about three years now
56:21 missed a good two and a half he would
56:24 only watch left-wing stuff and he would
56:27 just ingest it on a level that was scary
56:29 when I heard him talk I could hear his
56:32 kind beautiful soul inside of his body
56:35 but he would just just regurgitate
56:38 rhetoric everything was a soundbite and
56:43 over time he got to know me
56:45 and I don't actually know what he thinks
56:48 about me personally but it seems that
56:50 there's been this sort of respect bubble
56:53 between the two of us because I treat
56:55 him like a perfectly normal human being
56:56 and he treats me the same way and he
57:00 would bring up issues and he would go
57:01 but did you hear what Trump did did you
57:02 hear this did you hear that and I'd look
57:05 at him and I'd say well that's really
57:08 not true you know that right what yeah
57:11 you know go look up this go look up that
57:13 and he had the the chutzpah the guts to
57:19 look it up and he found out that he was
57:22 being manipulated now still you don't
57:26 want to find out you been nippy been
57:27 manipulated so a lot of there's just a
57:29 natural resistance to that sort of thing
57:32 so took him a little while but now when
57:35 I go to his house I look at what he's
57:39 watching on TV was I'm there to visit a
57:41 different person and I'll look at his TV
57:43 and he's watching
57:47 right-wing stuff you know maybe like
57:49 FoxNews but I mean FoxNews on his
57:51 television would have been heresy a year
57:54 ago two years ago for sure and so he's
57:57 trying to get the other side now we you
58:00 know like I say on this show
58:01 everything's fake news everything's fake
58:04 news there might be an individual that
58:06 speaks the truth for a little while one
58:07 of those organizations but in the end
58:09 their organization promotes dissent in a
58:13 way that's not healthy okay and it is
58:18 super windy today so how do we battle
58:21 groupthink and how do we succeed in
58:23 spite of it's almost natural existence
58:25 in the universe begin you get everything
58:28 right wouldn't you want to group the
58:30 group think something that's benefiting
58:33 society I don't know if that means an
58:38 individual is forbidden to think like
58:40 the the Twilight Zone episode I believe
58:43 it's called obsolete with burgess
58:45 meredith boy what a great episode it
58:50 turned into sort of a thx 1-1 3-8 before
58:53 that it was you know George Orwell's
58:57 1984 after that it was Huxley's brave
59:02 new world
59:02 I mean Huxley's brave new world is so
59:05 what this world is becoming a medicated
59:08 Society children being medicated as soon
59:11 as they're born which creates a bunch of
59:13 ADHD [ __ ] and bipolarism and
59:15 manic-depressive nough sand then they
59:17 have to go on more drugs to fix that but
59:19 the first vaccinations they took cause
59:21 that autism which is nothing more than
59:24 brain damage from vaccinations blamed on
59:27 your genetics if you got something in
59:30 your genes
59:31 it's not gonna be recessive for hundreds
59:34 and thousands of years and then all of a
59:36 sudden boom your kids are all messed up
59:38 that's a hundred percent the
59:41 introduction of chemicals that causes
59:43 the stomach dispel then the brain to
59:46 swell an infant right after they get
59:49 these vaccinations they go into the
59:51 hospital for convulsions some of the
59:53 kids come out and they're generally okay
59:55 but they have a lot of attention span
59:56 problems and so people people is so
60:00 funny man I got
60:00 plenty of friends with kids they're all
60:02 [ __ ] up and they'll go well my kid
60:05 took the vaccinations and they're just
60:06 fine my father even says well you got
60:08 them all when you were a kid you're just
60:09 fine I'm like dad I got like a handful
60:12 of [ __ ] vaccinations before it became
60:14 this methodology to save pharmaceutical
60:16 companies from going out of business but
60:20 who knows who knows maybe some
60:22 behavioral istic things I have were
60:25 caused by the vaccinations I got my
60:28 instinct says the following the idea and
60:30 concept of groupthink such as mob rules
60:33 think has to be something that we
60:36 discuss constantly well Mount Saint Tong
60:40 slaughtered upwards of 30 million people
60:43 in his own country the number goes
60:46 higher for some historians they they did
60:51 a two-step program there were a lot of
60:53 slum Lords I guess in China the country
60:58 at the time was just coming out of the
61:01 stone Age's I mean it really was they
61:03 were getting into the agricultural round
61:07 they'd been in for maybe a hundred years
61:08 again the country goes back thousands of
61:11 years and they were much better off few
61:15 hundred years back to be honest they
61:17 still fought like everybody did no
61:20 different than anyone else but he
61:22 created this movement where you were
61:24 allowed to murder landlords and there's
61:29 pictures of this I don't know if there's
61:31 movies of this but there's pictures of
61:32 it and I've seen it where people were
61:34 pulled up to like a guillotine there
61:37 sorry a gallo like a place to you would
61:39 normally hang people and they were just
61:40 chopping heads off and everyone would
61:43 come and watch it and they'd bring their
61:44 kids they'd see see that evil person
61:46 that's the reason why we have disease
61:49 and famine and that's why you're cold at
61:52 night sweetheart because these people
61:54 won't fix the buildings that we live in
61:55 so they cut all their [ __ ] heads off
61:57 like wow and some of you might be able
62:01 to hear that history and go well [ __ ]
62:02 them they they deserve to die all right
62:05 so that first phase goes the second
62:08 phase was anyone who dissented against
62:11 Mount Saint
62:13 and then it became the Spanish
62:15 Inquisition with essentially samurai
62:20 swords cutting everyone's head off
62:22 everyone was reporting everybody else to
62:24 make sure that they were perceived by
62:25 the government to be a good person bad
62:30 groupthink horrible groupthink Europe
62:34 did it first I have a book on the
62:37 Inquisition and when I bought this book
62:39 it was in sort of the bargain bin at
62:41 Barnes and Noble
62:41 I brought it home and started reading it
62:43 my job was on the ground I was only ever
62:46 taught about the Spanish Inquisition
62:48 according to this book it started in
62:50 England first it was about a 900 year
62:52 period where you still had you know they
62:55 were trying to drive Christianity into
62:57 the minds of people saying that Jesus
62:58 Christ really existed he's your Lord and
63:00 Savior and if you didn't follow the
63:01 church they just killed you off now they
63:07 also mentioned in this book that the
63:08 church never personally killed anyone or
63:11 torture didn't want to hurt anyone they
63:12 just interrogated you and freaked you
63:14 out but the book continued and said well
63:17 the Pope was one of the first
63:20 individuals to hire what we now know as
63:24 mercenaries people who are abstracted
63:27 away from the church that would do the
63:29 bidding of the church such that there
63:30 was no legal liability sort of like
63:32 Blackwater Blackwater murdered I don't
63:35 know thousands of people in the Middle
63:36 East and they were an outside agency so
63:39 when the United States government would
63:41 be were to be blamed for these murders
63:44 they would say well none of our soldiers
63:45 did this I don't know what you're
63:48 talking about and that's why they hung a
63:50 bunch of people on a bridge and burn
63:52 them alive in the Middle East because
63:54 they were like this is a Blackwater
63:55 retaliation moment so I think almost
63:57 every single culture has gone through
63:59 this Stalin killed a shit-ton of his own
64:01 people I mean the numbers I've heard or
64:04 starred in the 40 million reign don't
64:07 know that's what they say
64:09 genocide still going on in Africa one
64:12 tribes told another tribe should go and
64:15 you know the Warlord's are rewarded with
64:17 you know funds from the World Bank all
64:23 right
64:23 just gotta kill those people over there
64:25 yeah
64:26 and you'll live like a king we'll
64:28 protect you and if anyone ever tries to
64:29 cool you out office we'll drop in the
64:32 helicopters and pull you out and you can
64:34 go living built billionaire island or
64:37 just come live in Europe somewhere and
64:38 someone else will take over what do you
64:39 care I mean you got all your money your
64:40 family's totally taken care of okay
64:43 South America seems to struggle with the
64:47 concept of dictatorship they tend to dig
64:53 a dictator still now we've all been
64:56 through these phases every single race
64:57 on earth has been through these phases
64:59 where a dictator was okay when you look
65:02 at the the miniscule amount of history
65:06 that we can archive out of Egypt well
65:11 the pharaohs were dictators but it
65:13 pretty much seems like they had some
65:16 balanced history the official history of
65:19 Egypt is it was all a slave colony I
65:21 mean it was like slaves slaves slaves
65:23 slaves and so that creates martyrdom
65:27 right people that are heroes to the
65:31 movement when they break out of this
65:32 kind of thing the pyramids were rumored
65:34 to have been built by slaves when you
65:36 literally look at the lifestyles of the
65:38 individuals that built these pyramids
65:40 looks like they had little cities all
65:41 around every construction site these
65:44 individuals died in their 70s on average
65:46 full of full mouth full of teeth so
65:51 we're now revising that history if we
65:53 continually bring up groupthink I think
65:55 we have a defense mechanism against it
65:57 we have a checks-and-balances innovation
66:01 is the byproduct of individualism it
66:05 really is if Apple Computer had not been
66:09 created by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs
66:11 there would be no personal computers in
66:14 your house there would be probably no
66:17 cell phones in your house they got tired
66:20 of this notion that mainframes were the
66:24 only way that you got a hold of
66:25 computers and again it wasn't just these
66:27 two individuals I understand there was a
66:29 whole movement for independent computer
66:31 making back in the day they just
66:34 happened to take the lead on creating
66:35 one that was turnkey you bought it took
66:37 another box turned it on and there
66:39 your destiny right there in funny--i the
66:40 blinking cursor was worth tens of
66:43 billions of dollars back in the day
66:44 science doesn't progress unless you have
66:48 some Isaac Newton dude sitting around
66:51 going you know what I need to be able to
66:53 calculate the area of a curve so I'm
66:55 going to create calculus there's a lot
66:58 of debate about all Sciences but again
67:00 if if someone believes that the universe
67:05 is put together away because there's no
67:07 other game in town there's no other
67:08 explanation and if we happen to believe
67:12 a false paradigm of existence for 500
67:16 years a thousand years but then we
67:17 evolve out of that the only way we're
67:20 ever gonna evolve out of that as an
67:22 individual is probably going to look up
67:23 probably some little like I said
67:25 five-year-old little girl's gonna go I
67:26 don't think so I think it's like this
67:29 isn't it like that and their father or
67:30 mother is gonna go oh my gosh yeah you
67:35 know you should keep thinking about that
67:36 kid and when you get older because we're
67:39 not in some draconian you know police
67:42 state like thx 1-1 3-8
67:43 we're going to celebrate your epiphany
67:46 and your intelligence we're going to
67:48 give you the education that you need to
67:50 further your thinking hopefully limiting
67:53 you from being limited by paradigms and
67:56 then we have a new star a human star
68:00 that shines bright and takes us to the
68:03 next level so if groupthink kills that
68:05 but we have a big problem on our hands
68:08 so when you see cue and eye movements
68:11 and various movements that are here to
68:13 rescue everyone obviously we need to
68:15 come together as a group to do that kind
68:17 of thing but at the same time it's
68:19 important we don't create the next
68:21 draconian Overlord interpretation of
68:24 reality in the process but let me throw
68:26 there's one little thing at you here
68:28 before I close off what if you wanted to
68:30 live a simple life you wanted to get
68:32 married have kids have a nice job maybe
68:35 you just want to work at the convenience
68:36 store it pays the bills you don't need a
68:39 fancy house or a fancy car you recognize
68:42 human interaction is the most rewarding
68:44 thing your perhaps your relationship
68:46 with God on top of that and so you don't
68:49 for have any interest in politics or
68:52 science
68:52 there are all these other upper echelon
68:54 things that really give us a perception
68:56 of where we are and so someone's going
68:58 to have to take the reins on that and
69:00 that individual that wants to live a
69:02 simple life is going to have to trust
69:03 other individuals to take on those upper
69:07 constructs of existence that is where
69:11 you get czars dictators because people
69:15 are concerned well you know I got to
69:17 pick somebody to live underneath as my
69:21 leader that person seems handsome
69:24 beautiful articulate charismatic they
69:28 seem to have an answer for everything
69:30 whether they're right or wrong I don't
69:32 know because they're I don't live up in
69:34 those those realms of existence these
69:37 individuals in one of those simpler
69:39 lives may not have any interest in
69:40 history there's only so much time in the
69:43 day they'd rather raise really good kids
69:45 and perhaps their children grow up to be
69:48 those those leaders so it would seem to
69:52 me that there's this kernel of knowledge
69:53 that we sort of have to install in every
69:55 human being to brighella somehow simple
69:57 their lifes are so they understand well
70:00 I've heard that dictators are bad
70:02 because this can happen I don't need to
70:06 know the whole world history about
70:07 dictators but this little analogy this
70:10 little parable that is told to me about
70:12 dictators well that makes sense to me if
70:16 we were to build a set of rules to make
70:19 sure that dictators don't exist that
70:21 monarchs don't exist
70:23 the czars don't exist maybe that would
70:26 help which means where you have a lot of
70:30 homework to do I think it's not a cut
70:32 and dry thing is the point I'm trying to
70:34 make in this episode if everything was
70:37 evil in the world well groupthink makes
70:39 a lot of sense to people why it
70:40 shouldn't exist but again it gets all
70:43 good what do we do
70:48 I think you feel me I think it's about
70:51 as far as I can take that concept if you
70:53 haven't been to deep thoughts radio Calm
70:55 please go there's audio and video
70:57 there's a lakh Facebook group with the
70:59 coolest group of people on planet Earth
71:00 there's a Twitter account now if you
71:02 want to get your feed that way and
71:05 there's a patreon page in case you want
71:07 to donate I am creating a brand new deep
71:12 thoughts radio season 1 channel you can
71:15 just look that up on youtube and find it
71:17 it's going to be the remastered version
71:19 of the first 100 episodes because they
71:22 vary in quality in terms of production
71:24 so sometimes the mic is really low
71:26 sometimes the mic is completely
71:28 distorted I'm taking every one of the
71:30 soundtracks balancing and hopefully with
71:32 the intro and exit music so for those of
71:34 you like to go to sleep to my voice I
71:36 consider that a great compliment but I'm
71:38 trying to make sure you don't get this
71:39 gigantic pounding of the ear now it is
71:41 music so it's gonna you know be a lot
71:44 different than this soothing voice but
71:46 I'm trying to remove the distortion I'm
71:49 doing editing for the first episodes
71:51 that had a lot of pauses and all kinds
71:53 of stuff so I'm getting rid of that but
71:58 anyway take care of yourself and someone
72:00 else and I will see you in the next deep
72:02 thoughts over now
