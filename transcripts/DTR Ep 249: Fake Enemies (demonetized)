00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts in this on
00:37 location situation you see it's really
00:40 cold outside and so I've decided to go
00:43 ahead and try to record inside my smoke
00:46 lounge here Bulldog whoo good cigars
00:51 today as you can see we're going to talk
00:53 about something that I'm gonna call fake
00:55 enemies and it's probably something been
00:58 growing on me for about a year I think a
01:01 lot of you will be in on this as well
01:03 because you're sick and tired of the
01:04 [ __ ] that's going around we're in a
01:06 situation where we have a unique
01:07 opportunity because there's been some
01:10 major changes in leadership around the
01:14 world not just in America but we've had
01:19 I'll just keep it generic for a little
01:22 while here but you know I guess in
01:24 America it's almost an unfathomable I
01:31 should say unfathomable that the
01:35 Americans are being taught once again
01:37 out of thin air
01:39 to fear Russians sort of you know on the
01:47 side fear China the fears of China are
01:52 all economically based in terms of
01:55 Europe well up until the EU they were
01:58 our brothers in arms we all had our
02:00 separate countries our separate
02:01 currencies or separate cultures and they
02:04 were something called tourism to Europe
02:07 the amount of Americans that talk about
02:09 going to Europe in my circles is zero of
02:13 the few people that had their vacations
02:16 planned who don't follow politics and
02:18 follow this utter destruction of Europe
02:22 the goal in their vacations they come
02:25 back and they are in utter shock some of
02:29 my friends are actually from foreign
02:31 countries who have settled in America
02:33 and have to go over for business and
02:35 they can pass for their native country
02:38 let's say someone comes from China comes
02:40 to America and even if they've been here
02:43 for 20-30 years they still have a thick
02:44 accent let's just say and they go to
02:46 Europe and they carry their you know
02:50 their heavy Chinese accent or they just
02:52 speak in Chinese and it translated into
02:53 whatever language you're talking about
02:55 they're mortified about what they see
02:57 too because their whole life they have
02:59 grown up with this notion that Europe is
03:04 one way and they get there and they're
03:08 just utterly in shock and what's
03:11 interesting is you know we got North
03:12 Korea in this whole bunch of [ __ ]
03:14 he's got nuclear weapons Iran the Middle
03:18 East is just for most Europeans it's
03:21 considered like a cluster but we have
03:24 two things going on the young people of
03:28 the world look on the internet they look
03:31 on YouTube YouTube's probably the best
03:34 place to go to find out what other
03:36 people are like right there are dark
03:39 spots to every single country there's
03:41 poverty in every country there are
03:42 people that are racist and angry because
03:45 their life sucks they don't have a great
03:47 economy every country has a booming
03:49 region in a bust region right
03:53 and so yeah you could probably find a
03:56 video of Russians doing things bad you
03:59 can obviously find that of Americans and
04:01 Chinese and everybody right we know that
04:06 going back as far as documented
04:10 dictatorship history leaders have always
04:15 used war and enemies to distract the
04:18 people we know this
04:20 we've heard this a million times right I
04:23 told you a million times don't
04:26 exaggerate
04:27 and yet it's right in front of our face
04:30 right now there's a group of you who are
04:33 on board you're like yeah yeah totally
04:34 and we don't I don't personally being
04:37 you dislike any other country as a
04:39 country that's racism then we have these
04:42 parties here in America that are all
04:44 about you know social justice warrior
04:47 [ __ ] and black lives matters and all
04:49 that good stuff but you're supposed to
04:51 hate the Russians and if our president
04:54 happens to reach out to Russia and say
04:56 hey you don't worry about what Obama's
04:57 doing to you with all these sanctions
04:58 we're gonna lift them but don't don't go
05:00 crazy before I get a chance to come in
05:03 then he's gonna be supposedly impeach
05:06 for reaching out to our number-one
05:09 superpower in the world Russia there
05:14 should have been a delegation the second
05:16 the Kremlin fell the second that you
05:20 know again it was all [ __ ] or a
05:22 Gorbachev getting kicked out drunk
05:23 [ __ ] Yeltsin comes in who's basically
05:25 a [ __ ] for the the big banks at least
05:29 you know was a Christmas of 1999 when or
05:33 2001 Yeltsin said I'm quitting and
05:35 Putin's taking over just at that point
05:39 we should have reached out in made
05:41 amends we should have reached out and
05:42 been friends but brusher was pretty
05:45 messed up by the time
05:46 Boris got out when of course Boris made
05:49 everyone in Russia sign an agreement
05:52 that said you can't prosecute me he
05:55 actually gave himself immunity that's
05:58 unreal right but it's 2017 for [ __ ]
06:02 sake it's 17 to 18 years after Putin
06:05 took over people want to say Putin's a
06:08 bad guy
06:09 all right well it's a hell of a thing to
06:12 be the president of a big ass country
06:14 the dude is cleaned up Russia quite a
06:19 bit to be honest right
06:22 but regardless we should be friends with
06:25 everybody in this world why because it's
06:27 a smaller world now than it has ever
06:29 been ever but to go back to my two
06:32 groups you have the young people doesn't
06:35 matter how old you are if you're looking
06:36 and you're looking at just even fun
06:38 videos a really fun way to learn about
06:40 Russians is to look at all these prank
06:42 videos if they pull on their own people
06:43 they have you know candid camera shows
06:46 where they put a robotic spider that
06:48 comes out and scares people and you know
06:51 you see them react you see the young
06:52 people react and react just exactly like
06:54 us they were the same forking close
06:56 generally drive the same cars there's a
06:58 couple guys on the internet on in Russia
07:00 who are completely famous channel owners
07:03 and they take you all around Russia and
07:05 they say you know we didn't know that
07:06 you guys thought we lived in the Stone
07:08 Age is still things like let me take you
07:10 to a department store you know you've
07:12 heard all these stories about five mile
07:14 lines to get toilet paper here's let me
07:15 show you what it's like and he takes you
07:16 into place that's freaking brand-new
07:18 tens of thousands of state-of-the-art
07:21 items yeah who knows what their
07:23 qualities like or that [ __ ] but it
07:25 dismisses the myths about this place
07:28 right yes a long time ago in fact well
07:31 maybe not even that long ago 40 50 years
07:33 ago yeah it was sort of asked backwards
07:35 in a couple places he took them a lot
07:37 longer to to move ahead but guess what
07:41 folks go to the south in America you can
07:44 walk into little country towns that
07:45 haven't changed since the 1930s 1950s
07:49 are they bad people no there's a little
07:52 bit behind but whose is like who is the
07:55 second group I've talked about the first
07:56 group a couple times the second group
07:58 are these old [ __ ] baby boomers who
08:03 are predominantly in one political party
08:06 but I'd say they're in the other one as
08:08 well
08:09 there's a good amount there's a [ __ ] ton
08:11 of impact in the donkey world and
08:13 there's a few of impact in the elephant
08:15 world for those in Europe that's our
08:17 Democrat and Republican parties
08:18 respectively
08:19 they are trying to resurrect their
08:22 childhood I guess thinking it's hip and
08:26 cool to hate Russians now nobody knows
08:29 what the [ __ ] going on the Middle East
08:30 no one in America even has the option in
08:33 high school or college unless you're
08:35 going to vary
08:36 specialized colleges to even learn
08:37 Arabic so what is your what is your
08:41 ability to learn when an Arab thinks and
08:44 they're not all the same men so we are
08:48 intellectually cut off from that part of
08:51 the world and having any instinct about
08:53 who they are what kind of people they
08:54 are right but they don't want you to
08:56 look at their scandals they don't want
08:59 you to look at lalita island clinton
09:01 visits where they're having sex with
09:03 minors right they don't want you to
09:07 understand Eric Schmidt has resigned
09:09 from Google the day after President
09:12 Trump passes a executive order to chase
09:15 child trafficking people around and
09:17 seize all their assets they're coming
09:20 after that guy and dozens and dozens and
09:23 dozens more are gonna fall but no matter
09:25 Trump is alive or not
09:26 they're gonna fall enemies are
09:30 distractions in a lot of cases the very
09:34 interesting thing about this world which
09:36 I did you know it bothers me that people
09:38 haven't caught on to it which is we have
09:41 these catch phrases I've talked about
09:43 since the very first season of this show
09:44 which is you know if someone says well
09:49 everybody dies of cancer eventually die
09:51 cancer everything causes cancer and so
09:53 you write a blank check to GMO Monsanto
09:57 companies pharmaceutical companies
09:59 processed food companies you write a
10:03 blank check when you say all politicians
10:05 are corrupt right you hear this [ __ ]
10:09 it's actually not being said as much as
10:11 it used to be said when the baby boomers
10:14 weren't quite as old as they are now and
10:15 they're more like my age they felt in
10:19 the lecture wall that they were able to
10:21 come up with these stupid catchphrases
10:23 again I always say on this show I'm
10:25 always saying the same thing blank check
10:27 blank check blank check I seriously
10:28 recommend you try to incorporate that in
10:30 your in your daily lexicon so if you
10:35 really believed that most politicians
10:37 are corrupt and I think some of that's
10:38 going to be changing in the next 12
10:40 months here
10:42 then why would you listen to them you
10:44 know obviously there's one political
10:47 party that thinks that despite all the
10:50 sexual scandals financial scandals
10:53 uranium one scandals fusion GPS dossier
10:56 scandals and the list goes on and on
11:00 it's top secret email scandals all the
11:03 [ __ ]
11:04 supposedly those people are still
11:05 telling the truth I think that's amazing
11:08 it's called Stockholm Syndrome I've done
11:10 an episode on it if anyone's having a
11:13 problem go see us on my finer episodes I
11:16 believe we need to collectively and
11:20 perhaps we already are are doing this
11:22 it's I'm gonna mix two analogies and the
11:28 matrix it was about you know Morpheus
11:31 pulling neo out of the matrix getting
11:35 him out of that little pod and getting
11:36 all the tubes pulled out of his body and
11:38 sealing up all the problems giving in
11:41 the protein paste to eat right another
11:44 way of saying the red pill is to pull
11:46 your head out of your ass right and I
11:48 think most of us have done that to
11:50 ourselves at some point in the last 20
11:53 years but anybody who's pulled it out
11:56 before 9/11 on a really intense scale
11:59 you know you're you're Bill Hicks kind
12:01 of folks you're George Carlin kind of
12:03 folks hats off
12:07 hats off that you were able to just
12:09 figure it out you know Hunter s Thompson
12:11 all those guys there's a lot of citizens
12:13 like you that have been awake forever if
12:16 Alex Jones was watching he would be like
12:18 me too
12:19 yes Alex got out just as soon as he came
12:22 out of his mother's womb I swear to God
12:24 he was awake so it's one thing for us to
12:28 personally say that hating the Russians
12:31 is stupid I'm gonna focus on that one
12:33 because it is a giant pivotal moment of
12:36 stupidity going on in the world right
12:38 now right here's what I've been doing I
12:42 don't post on social media much as I
12:44 think it's just it's a horrible place to
12:47 try and get justice in the world because
12:49 you're dealing with almost a
12:50 concentrated pool of extremely ignorant
12:53 humans
12:55 but on my personal life I don't hang out
12:57 with morons but we don't all agree right
13:00 but what will happen is this this
13:03 innocent little thing sometimes you get
13:07 indoctrinated really young and you mean
13:09 well and you will repeat things we've
13:12 all done this dozens and dozens of times
13:15 you will repeat something that's kind of
13:17 stupid I should say maybe ignorant right
13:20 no one's ever informed you otherwise so
13:21 it's really more ignorance than anything
13:22 else and then someone enlightened you or
13:29 you might trip over a branch and your
13:31 face goes headfirst into real
13:34 information and you're like oh my gosh I
13:37 cannot believe I was towing this crap
13:41 embarrassing myself right but you shake
13:45 it off and you switch you know it's just
13:48 like the fictional character Paul in the
13:50 Bible who was Saul he was like a serial
13:53 murderer of Christians who supposedly
13:56 meets God in the desert and in boom he
13:57 is like the number one Christian on
13:59 planet Earth
14:00 telling us how to do do in my travels
14:03 more recently people been ringing up
14:05 this Russian dossier this Russian
14:07 collusion thing now I think as Lionel
14:11 Nations said he's a old prosecuting
14:15 attorney he said there's no law about
14:19 collusion it's a complete made-up bunch
14:21 of [ __ ] you can't go into you know
14:24 any law proceedings and there's
14:26 collusion the judge is gonna go that's
14:28 not in the law books I'm really sorry
14:30 did he commit a crime or you just want
14:31 to [ __ ] and moan that he won and you
14:33 lost right but I'll have people bring up
14:36 this hate Russia thing and I'll stop
14:40 them and I said are you really hanging
14:42 on to Cold War Dogma and they're going
14:45 what but I say so let me get this
14:48 straight you are acting like it's 1960
14:52 and Brezhnev or Stalin or Lenin is still
14:56 in power and
14:57 [Music]
14:59 we hate Russians again we hate Russians
15:03 freely we've gone all this way and
15:06 you're trying to tow that you need to
15:09 let go
15:10 right have you watched anything recently
15:13 about Russia all right one of my closest
15:17 friends staunch Bernie Sanders supporter
15:20 when Hillary stole the election from
15:22 Bernie he said that the proof doesn't
15:24 matter now you got to go for Hillary
15:25 because we gotta stop Trump really funny
15:27 and Russia Russia Russia Russia he's an
15:30 old guy over seven years old when I
15:34 asked him the first thing about world
15:35 history he knew nothing so I kind of
15:38 told him I said you should shut the [ __ ]
15:40 up I mean you should because you are
15:41 spreading this [ __ ] and you're not
15:43 willing to take the time out to learn
15:44 anything about where you are in the
15:48 universe you don't have any history you
15:50 don't know what you're talking about and
15:52 you're telling me that the evidence that
15:53 your guys election got ripped off
15:55 doesn't matter so you're gonna have the
15:57 criminal be a candidate for presidency
15:59 Wow that's the fabric of a Democrat but
16:05 the the reason why they think this will
16:08 work is that we know that both political
16:11 parties are completely out of touch with
16:13 a [ __ ] nation I'm going to keep f
16:15 bomb and this one I apologize the reason
16:20 why they are out of touch is we have no
16:21 term limits for senators and congressmen
16:24 what's that do well that allows a bunch
16:27 of [ __ ] fossils to get in there
16:28 actually they might get in there in
16:30 their 20s or 30s or whatever and then
16:33 they can live in that institution for as
16:35 long as they're willing to do what the
16:37 globalists want them to do right the
16:39 secondly vote against globalist agendas
16:41 then they don't get their funding and
16:43 they get kicked up
16:44 that's why they're completely out of
16:47 touch and that is why they are the
16:48 single group of individuals in the world
16:50 that cannot communicate nor
16:53 empathetically understand the needs of
16:55 their constituents and that is why we
16:59 need turn limits and that's why we have
17:01 to drain the swamp now I think most of
17:05 you been picking up on this and you know
17:06 I don't talk about current affairs that
17:08 much because this sort of makes this
17:10 episode a little bit timely and then
17:12 it'll kind of expire and it's use but I
17:15 feel like this does have a generic theme
17:18 to it which is we must be very careful
17:22 about who we deem our enemy we have to
17:29 because it's a manipulation of our own
17:33 minds right the swap is getting drained
17:36 in 2018 as long as things move the way
17:39 that they're supposed to be moving or I
17:41 should say the way they're moving now by
17:45 exposing the sexual scandals the
17:47 financial scandals and the child traffic
17:51 / child trafficking / pedophilia
17:54 scandals and it will shock the world the
17:59 world is there's a guy named Q Anan Q
18:03 anonymous it was all over Reddit and
18:05 Fortran maybe he's more in Fortran but
18:08 people are talking about it everywhere
18:10 and he has been predicting the future
18:12 like crazy and he's trying to tell you
18:15 that the episode I made on Alette elite
18:18 pedophilia and the episode I made on
18:21 evil everything that's in there those
18:24 two episodes is real and the people are
18:27 getting caught there's been some
18:30 interesting things according to my
18:31 closest associates George Soros isn't
18:35 hiding right now
18:36 he was just in Los Angeles helping
18:38 Hillary Clinton most evil [ __ ] on
18:41 planet Earth right what do you know
18:43 I guess the Rothschilds have had some
18:45 problems on their state it's all
18:48 hush-hush the Saudis have arrested you
18:51 what you know
18:53 several princes and their their
18:56 right-hand men up to 30 plus guys are
18:58 now in prison because they've been
19:00 caught funding Isis our president went
19:04 over there and said you know we're gonna
19:06 get along just fine business-wise but
19:08 you got a gag off all these guys that
19:10 are funneling money to all these
19:11 terrorist organizations because we need
19:13 the world to be safe don't you want the
19:14 world to be safe boom before he even got
19:18 back John stays these guys were arrested
19:19 and that he did something unprecedented
19:22 he flew from Saudi Arabia to Israel
19:25 we've never had those two trips in one
19:28 trip because it's sort of this you know
19:31 their arch enemies then we have this
19:33 recent thing where the the capital of
19:37 Israel has been moved to Jerusalem in
19:40 the world's up in arms all of these
19:43 would be allies of Israel who would you
19:49 know who's been funding Israel you know
19:50 billions and billions of dollars a year
19:53 come out and say you're not allowed to
19:55 determine the intellectual location in
19:59 your mind as to where your capital is
20:00 what does it physically do it physically
20:02 moves a few chairs and computers from
20:05 one city to the other right was a Tel
20:08 Aviv right who's of Tel Aviv to
20:09 Jerusalem
20:10 there's dissent in the EU and there's
20:12 this movement from the UN to block this
20:17 decision and anyone who supports it's
20:19 going to get penalized the UN helped
20:23 form Israel then I mean when you ask the
20:26 question why are you so pissed off that
20:28 they're simply moving the intellectual
20:30 capital from one city to another well
20:33 because it's gonna offend the
20:35 Palestinians okay
20:37 does that mean you care about
20:38 Palestinians all the sudden EU you win
20:41 do you care every country that seems to
20:43 be against this movement well where the
20:45 hell were you when their land was
20:47 captured in nineteen was it 48 as a
20:50 result of what the Russians excuse me
20:52 sorry as a result of what the Germans
20:55 did to the Jews in Europe
20:57 Terry Jones for Monty Python did a great
20:59 series on the Crusades back in 1996 was
21:04 a to to VHS tape things don't even know
21:07 what it would be like today but Terry
21:09 Jones is a brilliant guy is all the men
21:11 from mighty Python er exceptionally
21:14 brilliant humans but the one thing that
21:16 he noted was that when the land just
21:20 before Israel was created the land was
21:24 actually 50/50 Jew Palestinian Jew and
21:27 Arab and everyone was integrated and got
21:30 along just fine and then when this this
21:34 you know was a League of Nations comes
21:36 by and says boom it's not Israel then
21:38 all these Arabs were moved off of land
21:40 that they had owned for a thousand years
21:42 I had it told to me that the average
21:45 farmland was in possession in a single
21:48 family for anywhere from 900 or more
21:51 years can you imagine tracking your
21:54 family back that far Jesus so hella
21:57 easier when your family does it leave
21:59 all right so it's like you have little
22:01 tombstones out there somewhere but now
22:05 Israel does all of its things to push
22:08 the Palestinians into this little tiny
22:09 spot on their land
22:11 there's animations all over the internet
22:13 of the Palestine is getting crushed into
22:15 this little tiny singularity no one says
22:18 anything now there's I believe about 360
22:23 plus or Israeli soldiers who are now
22:25 forming have formed a group saying that
22:28 a lot of the rocket launches claimed to
22:30 have originated from the Palestinian
22:31 land into Israel was actually
22:33 orchestrated by them and I've seen like
22:36 Navy SEAL incredible badass Israeli
22:39 soldiers sobbing in courts saying that
22:43 was us we forged these events so that we
22:45 there's be a pretext for us destroying
22:47 the slain and pushing the ball with a
22:49 wall back
22:50 America is a bunch of [ __ ] for
22:52 building a wall on the South border of
22:55 the United States north border of Mexico
22:58 well Mexico's got a gigantic border at
23:00 the end of their country right but
23:02 they're not [ __ ] for having a border
23:04 at the end of theirs and we're Israel's
23:05 not a bunch of [ __ ] for taking our
23:07 money and building a wall around
23:08 Palestine right slightly different
23:12 problem right we don't have you know
23:14 Mexicans coming up in bombing cafes it
23:16 is a different world but then again
23:18 we're not crushing Mexico South we're
23:21 not taking we're not building a wall and
23:22 then moving it back a hundred miles
23:24 every year just sequestering land from
23:27 folks that we don't have any right to
23:29 take the land from right we're not doing
23:31 that so I think if we were to do that we
23:33 might have a few skirmishes here in
23:35 there and bombings or whatever we'd have
23:37 some bad stuff there's no shortage of
23:39 tough hombres down there right I
23:42 mentioned these sort of double standards
23:44 and around the world because Israel is
23:49 usually and again I know that a lot of
23:52 you guys I shouldn't say a lot but
23:54 there's a few of you out there that
23:55 believe there's a big Jewish cabal with
23:58 Zionist bankers and that kind of stuff
24:00 well I would say that if you want to say
24:02 a Zionist is a banker bankers are
24:07 aristocrats bankers are you know the
24:11 oligarchy of the world they're
24:12 everywhere in every country you know
24:16 there's more billionaires in China right
24:18 now than anywhere else in the world I
24:20 mean they had this gigantic growth right
24:23 are they bad because were jealous of
24:25 their money right so Israel was you know
24:32 sort of a public sweetheart to the
24:36 United Nations created by the League of
24:38 Nations which turned into the United
24:40 Nations most leaders talked favorably
24:44 about Israel until they want to move
24:47 their capital city right again it's an
24:51 office that's empty in Jerusalem and
24:54 they're just gonna move it from Tel Aviv
24:55 that's it that's the only thing that's
24:57 really occurring here everyone needs to
24:59 [ __ ] take a poop and relax
25:00 right but they need enemies
25:04 everybody needs an enemy right Israel
25:08 has this dinky tiny little patch and
25:11 obviously there's a lot of religious
25:12 history and I understand that for people
25:14 who are still hanging on to that
25:16 outdated dogma and you know yeah sure
25:19 you can be in a war for the rest of your
25:20 existence as long as you hang on to
25:21 yesterday's fiction right but we have
25:25 areas of the world were in that
25:27 particular area submit some really
25:29 screwed up stuff going on and they hate
25:31 each other probably for some legitimate
25:35 reasons and probably for some not so
25:36 legitimate reasons right America and
25:39 Russia should become friends America and
25:44 China are already friends yeah there was
25:48 a little tanker it was caught dropping
25:51 off some oil in North Korea all right
25:54 you have to understand guys if that
25:56 country doesn't get at least a little
25:58 bit of strategic resources from outside
26:01 countries the whole place crumbles
26:03 people die so you know it's it's one
26:07 thing to say get tough on sanctions and
26:09 all this other crap but
26:11 if someone said yeah well if that tanker
26:14 doesn't show up you know 100,000 people
26:17 freeze to death and it's Kim Jong Un's
26:20 fault that these people die so who are
26:24 we who are we in this world that we
26:25 wouldn't want that suffering to happen
26:27 simply because a dictator in that
26:28 country that's got full control full
26:30 physical and mental control over these
26:32 people is trying to give them alive now
26:38 we are told that North Korea has nukes
26:39 and I've said it several times on the
26:41 show they do not have news okay we get
26:45 all these rocket launches from North
26:50 Korea all these photographs and there's
26:52 movies and stuff well there a lot of
26:55 their footage has been faked I can tell
26:57 you from being a special-effects person
26:59 myself at least having colleagues is
27:01 very you know good friends of mine with
27:04 their Emmys all over their houses and my
27:07 own dabbling in that industry you can
27:10 see the particle effects generators what
27:12 we call skating assets in the
27:14 composition shot it just looks like [ __ ]
27:17 now it looks like perhaps they bought
27:20 some old-ass rockets from China but
27:25 honestly you could go to China and film
27:27 a rocket launch and then broadcast it on
27:30 TV and say it came from Korea now we've
27:34 got rockets that are now dumping into
27:36 oceans supposedly so looks like they
27:39 might have some old toys then we see
27:41 Rockets fake rockets and parades where
27:45 the nose cones are all wonky because
27:48 they're their props you saw this in
27:50 Russia a long time ago as well and that
27:52 may just be a strategic thing where you
27:54 don't want to have a bunch of missiles
27:55 at a parade and then that draws in
27:58 potentially a military strike from your
28:00 competitor you know who knows but I'll
28:04 tell you one thing that they would have
28:05 that they would have done because
28:08 they're not following any [ __ ] rules
28:09 in North Korea according to what we were
28:12 told about them right
28:14 we would see a mushroom cloud above soil
28:17 which is actually an international
28:18 felony I guess as a results of the
28:20 treaty signed in 1973 but if Korea
28:23 doesn't sign the treaty I'm not sure
28:25 they're bound by it but above-ground
28:27 testing was said to be deemed fully
28:29 illegal by all countries of the
28:32 capability in 1973 again North Korea
28:35 wasn't capable even in rumor in 1973
28:40 they wish but then that leaves you with
28:44 ground testing ground testing is pretty
28:47 easy to film India filmed it then
28:49 Pakistan filmed it doesn't mean it's a
28:51 nuke it just means you got ton of [ __ ]
28:52 in the ground like tea and tea and you
28:54 blow the crap out of it and as long as
28:56 the earth surges and then pancakes down
28:59 you striking those craters everywhere
29:01 all right at least we have to suspect it
29:05 might be real right none of that a lot
29:09 of you guys are familiar with the
29:12 Roswell crash and the cover story is
29:16 that it's a weather balloon and that it
29:19 was a high-altitude weather balloon that
29:21 was supposed to sense the the echoes of
29:25 nuclear testing from Russia and those
29:28 type of balloons definitely existed well
29:31 they're at launching them over New
29:32 Mexico for God's sakes trying to listen
29:35 to very faint signals from Russia as it
29:39 shook the the atmosphere right well I
29:44 guarantee you that we have plenty of
29:47 geocentric satellites over our enemies
29:50 quote-unquote and they're hanging over
29:54 North Korea like crazy right now we just
29:57 had a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket supposedly
30:00 launched over LA we could get week ago
30:03 actually went out and watched it after
30:05 one of my friends takes me goes cold
30:06 outside go outside
30:08 and the word thing is is they launched
30:10 it in the opposite orbit of all other
30:14 satellites that are ever launched when
30:16 you launch out of California and you go
30:18 towards the Pacific Ocean that is in the
30:21 opposite orbit I forgot the name of that
30:22 orbit for those of you familiar with the
30:25 Black Knight satellite the mysterious
30:27 things been up there for a while sort of
30:30 like that it's bizarre I mean the Black
30:33 Knight thing is it's it's asinine that
30:36 we haven't flown up to it to figure out
30:38 what the hell it is I'm sure we actually
30:40 have but they don't report back and some
30:42 alien thing up there but the thing about
30:44 that satellite is that it goes in the
30:46 opposite orbital direction as everything
30:49 else when they launch from Cape
30:52 Canaveral they launch over the Atlantic
30:55 and that's the direction everything else
30:56 goes but I found it interesting that
30:59 this thing went over the Pacific well
31:02 the the contract from SpaceX includes a
31:06 lot of resupplying missions with the
31:09 space station and you cannot rendezvous
31:11 with the space station if you're going
31:12 the wrong direction but that direction
31:15 is sort of over by Asia isn't it so it
31:18 might be some geocentric satellite
31:21 that's up there hovering over North
31:25 Korea or something right very
31:27 interestingly bizarre orientation to the
31:29 launch maybe one of you can explain it
31:31 to me but remember after 9/11 we had
31:35 George Bush jr. label North Korea as an
31:40 axis of evil and some of us are sitting
31:44 here in America going what we're worried
31:47 about
31:47 Saudi Arabia and hijackers 19 of them
31:51 bombing the World Trade Center
31:53 supposedly let's go with the official
31:54 story right hitting it with Jets and all
31:58 of a sudden he's talking about in North
32:00 Korea Kim jong-il was still alive at the
32:04 time I'm pretty sure so what the hell
32:07 was he talking about in his State of the
32:09 Union speech [ __ ] was getting planned to
32:12 turn that bizarre unknown little world
32:15 over there into an enemy
32:17 well what's the common denominator of
32:20 all countries that are accused of being
32:24 accesses of evil from America
32:29 specifically well it's whatever our
32:32 nation is most ignorant about we cap we
32:36 it's very easy for us to have them
32:38 labeled as enemies because we don't know
32:41 anything about them we don't speak
32:42 Arabic well the CIA has been in the
32:47 Middle East forever right
32:49 Osama bin Laden as a CIA asset before he
32:51 died that's Declassified al CI de was
32:55 the database that tracked all the
32:57 warlords and everything that we're
32:58 serving us when they were fighting the
33:00 Russians in Afghanistan and when the
33:04 iran-iraq war was going on right there's
33:07 videos of zyg new Brzezinski getting off
33:09 a helicopter and trying to indoctrinate
33:11 warlords it didn't give a [ __ ] about
33:13 these infidel passages in the Quran we
33:17 were like man we grow poppy seeds dude
33:19 who the [ __ ] are you right
33:21 but North Korea is this isolated world
33:26 all indications are that the people do
33:28 not live charm' lives
33:30 I don't know personally there I've seen
33:33 the Vice specials and some other
33:34 independent specials where people go
33:36 over and film and obviously it's a
33:37 really bizarre world with hospitals that
33:39 are empty colleges that are empty people
33:42 who slip and say they'd actually rather
33:45 be you know not a soldier they'd rather
33:47 be a scientist or do something that they
33:49 want to do so it's easy to victimize
33:53 these people have you ever realized that
33:57 that we don't really well I don't speak
34:00 North Korean okay and that's sort of a
34:04 joke and we don't really have access to
34:08 their television channels over there to
34:11 get it live and hear what they are
34:14 saying about their world about us we get
34:19 it from Reuters or AP that's been
34:21 filtered through your favorite
34:23 mainstream media your fake news
34:26 and we're told what they're saying
34:28 they're calling our president a name
34:30 they're threatening this and not and the
34:32 other thing do you know if that's even
34:35 true do you all I got to say is you
34:40 better know you better know if it's true
34:43 because they're gonna potentially use
34:46 these enemies to distract us now I think
34:51 that things in America are a lot
34:52 different now and I think that frivolous
34:54 Wars may or may not be something that's
34:57 going to happen but I think what's gonna
34:59 be happening in America is the following
35:01 if there are strong men like Kim Jong
35:04 hoon for instance where you know god no
35:08 who knows if he's doing what he's doing
35:10 who knows if he had his brother kill
35:11 there was a sister killed or whatever
35:13 maybe is maybe he's having his generals
35:16 murder cuz he's turning into that
35:17 paranoid Castro it's like Colombo who
35:20 played Castro on Twilight Zone it goes
35:24 completely nuts looking into mirrors
35:25 because he thinks everyone's after him
35:27 he says everybody killed then he finds
35:30 himself completely low until he goes
35:32 completely nuts right there has to be
35:34 reason why David Rockefeller I believe
35:36 in his autobiography written in the late
35:38 70s said that he thought and this is
35:41 when China was far from being as
35:44 industrialized and as amazing it is
35:45 today he said that China was the model
35:47 country for the entire world and this
35:51 was when it was deep into the communist
35:54 rule you know they hadn't really
35:57 translated their their work force into a
36:01 you know being able to use computers
36:03 because they still used a lot of their
36:05 ancient symbols and typing those a huge
36:07 pain in the ass
36:08 they couldn't translate what was it
36:11 15,000 16,000 symbols or something into
36:14 a computer so they were really catching
36:16 up so he was claiming that that country
36:18 was a model country I would wager that
36:21 he also believes that North Korea's won
36:23 because it has got the globalists which
36:26 in that particular case is their
36:28 government completely controlling them
36:31 we don't need the tension on the DMZ
36:33 between North Korea and South Korea that
36:36 needs to be dismantled
36:39 I have friends of mine who are Chinese
36:42 that believe that the China will
36:44 infiltrate that place and take out kim
36:46 jeong-hoon however they need to and that
36:50 place will be modernized over the next
36:52 20-30 years like you know East Germany
36:54 has been rehabilitated right hopefully
36:58 can avoid a [ __ ] like Merkel running
37:01 their world but the last couple things
37:04 we've got to do to get rid of these
37:05 false enemies is we have to make it
37:07 impossible for any country to be deemed
37:12 an enemy by integrating them with the
37:16 rest of the world through the internet
37:20 right through
37:22 maybe distributing there the ability to
37:24 learn their language making it a lot
37:27 easier so we can communicate you know
37:30 there's all these cool like babel fish
37:32 electronics now there's one that's
37:33 bouncing around YouTube versus arrium a
37:36 Facebook right now where you put these
37:37 little earbuds in and look like Apple
37:40 earbuds and they instantaneously
37:42 translate what the other person is
37:43 saying into your native language and it
37:47 may be vaporware right now but it's
37:49 coming for sure these people are walking
37:51 around at bleep Paris and I think it's
37:55 an American who's participating in its
37:56 invention and walked around with a girl
37:58 from Paris who spoke French she's
38:01 hearing French he's hearing English and
38:03 it allowed them to freely communicate
38:06 that's huge you know there's all kinds
38:09 of devices where you can talk into it
38:10 people use it all the time the second we
38:13 can start saying hey
38:15 I have nothing against you and they go I
38:17 don't have a thing against you either do
38:20 you like sunshine totally do would you
38:22 like to control your destiny
38:23 absolutely China knows that they are
38:27 going to lose communistic control over
38:32 their country and so they're slowly
38:33 ebbing it to a full capitalistic country
38:37 they know they have no choice because
38:40 there's too many people and not enough
38:42 soldiers to enforce it and but I don't
38:45 mind being rich and powerful I don't
38:49 mind so hanging on to the old methods
38:52 which don't really yield any benefits
38:55 what's the point even Russia has turned
38:58 into a capitalistic country right
39:01 I'd say China is in a massive
39:03 capitalistic country now and capitalism
39:06 and its most fundamental definition okay
39:09 because I hear you know Michael Moore
39:13 followers and whatever people hating
39:17 capitalism there is corruption a second
39:21 to capitalism exists but that doesn't
39:23 have to be because we don't have to be
39:25 ignorant about how capitalism works we
39:27 are ignorant about how capitalism works
39:29 because we don't typically get into the
39:30 scenario I'm about to outline for you
39:33 when someone's taking a big [ __ ] on
39:35 capitalism you stop them and you say
39:39 well do you know what capitalism is and
39:42 they usually give you a really stupid
39:45 kind of but you know it's like it's with
39:48 big corporations and remem'er mm-hmm
39:51 capitalism is when you have an idea and
39:54 you cannot fund your idea and you must
40:00 ask someone else to give you money to
40:04 realize your idea your vision they
40:07 capitalized your idea with money now
40:13 you're talking to a guy who's got a lot
40:15 of experience with this there are
40:19 absolutely just like just like
40:22 pedophilia and politicians right you
40:27 know I should say this when when
40:29 Vice President Biden became vice
40:31 president they whispered it in Zaire and
40:33 said really you know what dude you can
40:36 do anything you want and you'll never go
40:38 to jail okay
40:39 because you're the vice president and we
40:41 don't allow vice presidents or
40:43 presidents or any of their immediate
40:44 family to go to jail because that'll
40:49 make America look bad and it's more
40:51 important than America look good than
40:53 you going to jail and so what did the
40:55 perv Biden do
40:56 he started sexually harassing every
41:00 single female they could get his hands
41:04 on and especially little girls go watch
41:07 the videos look up Biden touching girls
41:09 Biden pedophile and you will see him
41:13 grabbing the breasts of very very young
41:16 girls under ten years old and the girls
41:19 will swat his hand away there's a little
41:20 asian girl that had her breasts grabbed
41:22 her right breast was grabbed by him
41:25 you'll see I believe sessions SWAT his
41:28 hand away from a girl because he cannot
41:30 stop touching this girl even when the
41:32 mothers were like trying to get their
41:34 girls out of the room after they figured
41:35 out what if [ __ ] perv this guy was
41:38 and let me just get you hip on something
41:41 because a friend of mine had this happen
41:43 with the pasture very close friend of
41:46 mine at this beautiful little girl he's
41:48 not full-grown girl but there pasture
41:53 was a perv go figure
41:57 and I guess one of the trends with pervs
42:02 is to stand behind a young girl I guess
42:06 boy in some cases but whatever is is a
42:08 big one for the straight ones and they
42:10 rub their junk on the back of the child
42:14 through their pants I didn't know this
42:17 but where's Biden every single time this
42:20 kind of stuff's going on he's fondling
42:22 their hair and he's whispering into
42:24 their ears and he makes those jokes like
42:25 that Canadian game show host look up
42:28 Canadian game show host pedophile I
42:31 don't know this guy cuz I didn't grow up
42:32 in Canada but the videos are just so
42:35 evident this guy was trying to get a
42:37 kiss from every little girl talking
42:39 about dating them talking about marrying
42:41 them talking about basically having
42:43 sex with them right in front of their
42:44 parents their mother's Biden's doing the
42:47 same thing taught red-handed on video
42:51 you can show Democrat that and have fun
42:54 we'll go oh my god I never knew and the
42:56 other ones go well I'm sure that's
42:57 nothing so capitalists the guys that
43:02 capitalized you there's a small group of
43:05 them who are so legit you almost can't
43:08 even believe your ears when you hear
43:09 about how they've capitalized something
43:11 I met a guy who's a an in-law of a good
43:15 friend of mine and I said well what do
43:17 you do for a living and he was telling
43:20 me that he started this landscaping
43:23 company I said oh yeah you know I'm an
43:27 entrepreneur tell me how it started and
43:28 he said well it was really weird I was
43:30 doing landscaping right around here in
43:31 bel-air and he goes I didn't realize but
43:34 my client has this beautiful home and of
43:36 course on handling mowing lawn and
43:38 cleaning his pool out also that kind of
43:39 stuff and he said we were just talking
43:43 after I finished up and he asked me what
43:45 I'd really like to do with my life and
43:47 he said I got this I got this idea that
43:49 isn't tapped and a Los Angeles I forgot
43:51 what the actual hook was but something
43:53 very special and the dude said well how
43:55 much money would it take to get you set
43:57 up and this is in the late 70s or the
44:00 80s you said well the problem is gonna
44:03 take me about a hundred thousand dollars
44:04 to pull this off he said ok the guy goes
44:09 in his den gets out his checkbook and I
44:11 believe wrote him a check for like 150
44:13 so there
44:14 consider me your first partner and they
44:18 ran that company I guess for almost 30
44:20 years that's capitalism in its finest
44:24 form right no contract just trust a
44:28 handshake like the old days when I
44:31 thought of you've watched this episode
44:32 on Netflix about the Kenner toy company
44:36 that got the contract from 20th Century
44:39 Fox and Lucas Films to do the toys for
44:42 Star Wars
44:43 it was a handshake for I think three to
44:46 four years actually by two years I think
44:49 it was two years right no no it was
44:53 actually three years cuz it took him a
44:54 year to make the toys and then it was
44:55 two years into the toys before they
44:57 actually finalized the contract but what
44:59 were the percentages lucasfilm's got
45:01 five percent twentieth century-fox got
45:03 five percent and Kenner got ninety
45:05 percent on a handshake and they honored
45:09 that that any writing today that would
45:11 never ever happen the way it happens
45:13 today you know I mean to put down any
45:15 particular company but I'll tell you a
45:17 good friend of mine this company no
45:21 longer exists I can reveal is a very
45:24 good friend of mine left EA and created
45:26 his own company and he eventually got
45:30 the idea to resurrect Tetris he goes off
45:34 to the company THQ which I know what the
45:35 Kings this anymore he signs a contract
45:37 with them where he gets 95 cents on the
45:41 dollar and they get 5 cents for
45:42 distribution yeah my buddy financed the
45:45 entire thing got the whole thing going
45:47 when they started getting the royalty
45:51 check they were getting 5 cents and THQ
45:54 was taking 95 cents now they had a
45:57 signed contract ok
46:00 my buddy then you know obviously he's
46:05 like what the [ __ ] and they said yeah we
46:07 don't like this deal we're not gonna
46:08 honor it
46:08 he says well I got it in writing this is
46:11 oh well you can sue us if you want now I
46:13 guarantee you that contract would have
46:15 held up in court a hundred percent no
46:17 problems at all he goes to his father
46:20 and his father tells him to cower down
46:21 and I told him to go stick it to him
46:23 because I said THQ isn't doing very well
46:24 you need to get your money before these
46:26 guys go out of business he settle for 22
46:29 cents on the dollar and then he went out
46:33 of business had he gone for the 95 cents
46:36 he would have had enough capital in his
46:38 own bank to continue going when he had a
46:41 particular dry season that wiped him out
46:43 he also had a bad partner that took him
46:46 for a bunch of well a bad partner that
46:49 caused such a disruption that my buddy
46:51 couldn't find work he had to basically
46:53 fix projects instead of going out
46:54 looking for projects
46:56 and he lost his company so what do you
46:59 do if you get rid of capitalism how do
47:02 you get rid of it you need money to
47:04 realize an idea well you're gonna have
47:07 to do what gene Simmons says which I
47:09 mentioned the consumerism episode you're
47:11 gonna have to save up your own money
47:12 until you can do it start really small
47:13 and work your way up and hope to god
47:17 okay that your competition doesn't
47:19 realize what you're doing who can wipe
47:21 you out because they do have the capital
47:23 and the other one is is that there are
47:25 fake investors out there I've recently
47:28 had this experience in a really painful
47:30 way people will say that they're rich
47:32 and then you find out they have no money
47:36 oh they got a little bit
47:37 they can kind of be dangerous with their
47:40 money but they really don't have any
47:41 money or they're there to steal your
47:43 idea the second that they can they play
47:45 divide-and-conquer games it could be bad
47:48 it can be bad but there used to be a
47:51 time when you could walk into a bank in
47:53 America and get a loan as long as you
47:56 presented a decent business plan you
47:58 showed a growth pattern you showed your
47:59 clientele you showed out you're gonna
48:01 make money you showed the gap in the
48:03 market where what you're offering is
48:05 viable
48:06 I believe my own father borrowed money
48:10 to start as a photography studio back in
48:12 the day well it looked at it and said
48:15 well makes sense there's plenty of room
48:17 out there for more photographers go for
48:20 it you're already a photographer you're
48:21 already doing this business so we're
48:23 simply going to give you enough money to
48:24 have a teeny tiny brick-and-mortar place
48:26 where you could show your photography at
48:27 the front window and you can develop all
48:29 the photography in the back but
48:32 capitalists are also enemies right the
48:36 1% movement that came and went right no
48:40 doubt we need major major reform in
48:42 those areas but we need to actively
48:46 dispel these rumors about hating other
48:50 countries now you know I'm very critical
48:53 and have been very critical on episodes
48:55 in season 1 and 2 about these migration
49:00 movements that are going on and if
49:02 you've ever seen that that you know that
49:04 little episode where the guy was at some
49:06 sort of TED talk and he did the marble
49:08 thing where he had all these our gumball
49:09 these gumballs in these giant
49:11 cylindrical containers we could see
49:15 inside and every gumball was a certain
49:18 number of people in the world and he
49:20 filled up all these things with all the
49:21 people in the world he had three
49:22 gigantic towers and he goes this is
49:24 everyone who's not living in a first
49:26 world country and they too teeny tiny
49:29 jars which is basically Europe in the
49:30 United States in a few other countries
49:32 you know he said let's say we accept ten
49:37 million he pulls out like I think ten
49:38 little gumballs and he puts them in
49:40 Europe and he goes look how much is left
49:43 he goes these little containers are no
49:46 bigger than they are which means it was
49:47 the landmass this was the container
49:49 representing he says look you can't
49:51 absorb all the third-world countries you
49:53 can't the only thing you can do is go
49:57 help them where they live right there's
50:02 this huge double standard that just
50:05 infuriates me with Mexico our brothers
50:09 to the south very good people
50:11 super super wonderful people and they
50:17 you know the whole movement is to allow
50:19 them to come to America every single one
50:22 of them wants to come to America we're
50:23 supposed to absorb them but the weird
50:25 thing is is they live on some of the
50:27 most beautiful land on planet earth
50:29 right tropical zone really good weather
50:33 all the time
50:34 gorgeous beaches beautiful inland
50:37 mountain escapes and all kinds of stuff
50:39 now we know when you visit there ok the
50:42 streets are mostly dirt the homes are
50:45 dilapidated the income is horrible the
50:47 average human being makes about five
50:48 hundred bucks a month no matter what
50:50 your profession is and our solution is
50:55 to open the border and just say come on
50:57 in come in because the Democrats want
50:59 votes we know that they just immediately
51:01 give them driver's license and we give
51:04 them voting ballots even though they're
51:06 not you know citizens of the United
51:07 States complete voter fraud the one
51:09 thing that a soldier gives their life
51:12 for in this particular country is to
51:14 protect the First Amendment freedom of
51:15 speech the Second Amendment to protect
51:17 the First Amendment but in order to keep
51:19 all this intact the substrate of our
51:22 country in any first world
51:23 progressive country that's fought for
51:25 its rights is voting and voter fraud now
51:29 is the absolute standard for getting
51:32 anything done in America up until last
51:35 year there's a huge change going on in
51:39 the United States of America to catch
51:41 these guys and the funny thing is is
51:43 that the folks that do it constantly and
51:45 one particular party in general is still
51:49 living in the past and they still think
51:51 they can't get caught because they
51:52 haven't been caught to this date and
51:53 they'll just have another baby boomer
51:55 talk to a baby boomer and say they can
51:57 never catch us oh really okay let's do
51:59 it all right about paying attention to
52:02 the price of milk which is an analogy
52:05 for the rest of us that know how they do
52:06 it now all right we've had defectors
52:09 from these voting machine companies
52:11 saying exactly how it works and
52:13 confessing in town hall meetings at
52:16 least in Florida that Jeb Bush and some
52:18 other senator down there only got
52:20 reelected because he reprogrammed the
52:22 voting machines to throw the votes
52:24 you know this whole Roy Moore thing I
52:27 don't know anything about the guy I
52:28 don't endorse the guy don't know maybe
52:30 he did what he did but is the aerbook
52:32 was forged against him already is a
52:34 complete criminal allowed to practice
52:36 law she brings more false confession or
52:40 false accusation folks that have to
52:42 confess that was a person paid off or
52:44 they forged things when they go down and
52:47 look at the Roy Moore votes they found
52:49 cases of ballots prefilled out for his
52:53 competitor with no names at the top
52:55 voter fraud right now Mexico is is an
53:03 interesting double standard because why
53:04 why does America tell you that the
53:07 Middle East needs to be taken over they
53:10 always say the same thing to spread
53:12 democracy well if you have any family
53:15 member who's been a soldier over the
53:17 head let's say the last thing that's
53:18 going on is democracy last thing that
53:20 going on is any level of progress they
53:22 bombed the living crap out of that whole
53:24 place and he left it the way it is
53:26 in Libya right now people are being sold
53:29 like slaves you can buy a guy for 400
53:33 bucks a black male you can buy them for
53:35 $400 in Libya why is that because Libya
53:39 was destroyed when Qaddafi was murdered
53:42 by the Obama administration right so if
53:46 we have in America this standard of
53:48 going over and spreading democracy then
53:51 why don't we help Mexico why doesn't
53:54 that happen why don't we go down and say
53:57 okay is the government corrupt all right
54:00 then we should change that do the people
54:03 have the freedom to walk around in the
54:05 middle of the night just like Americans
54:08 without being stopped by a federally
54:10 nope you can't go down there without
54:13 getting sites that like are friends of
54:15 mine that go down to Tijuana and deep
54:17 inside Mexico all the time to go on
54:18 vacations and to visit friends and to
54:21 get services down there and they bring a
54:25 whole stash of things to pay off the
54:26 federales cigars and and gifts and money
54:32 and they just know if they show up with
54:33 500 bucks in their pocket it's going
54:35 away
54:36 they don't take cash with them unless
54:38 they know that cash is gonna go to
54:39 someone who's gonna pull them over
54:41 yep and community any crimes we know
54:44 that the cartels are fighting for space
54:45 down there they're fighting Colombia
54:47 cartels are fighting each other right
54:49 good people that are being converted
54:52 into this militant group if you watch
54:56 all those person shows on Netflix
54:58 you know the lockup series and you find
55:01 all these guys that have hit their late
55:04 30s early 40s they're starting to defect
55:06 out of these groups they go into a
55:07 protective custody they're the special
55:10 needs
55:11 you know divisions because they're gonna
55:13 get killed if they get caught again
55:15 because they pulled out of the of the
55:17 cartels right
55:18 it's a tough world down there well the
55:22 idea is that's why the people want to
55:23 live up here they actually don't want to
55:26 leave their country that they have to
55:28 right they're terrifying
55:31 I've said it a couple of times in the
55:33 show that I you know I used to have a
55:35 buddy owned a restaurant used to talk to
55:36 the the cooks
55:38 and they from time to time would have to
55:42 go down and rescue a relative or send
55:44 500 to 5,000 dollars down to a prison to
55:46 get the parents out because they simply
55:48 went and got milk at the wrong time at
55:50 night and it's just extortion
55:54 so we spending the Democratic way but
55:58 we're not helping our closest neighbor
55:59 to the south it's not Canada's neighbor
56:03 it's our neighbor right you know and
56:07 let's break down the analogy in a
56:08 different way so that people can
56:10 understand it just in case someone
56:11 argues with you about that analogy which
56:12 I don't see how they possibly could
56:14 right if you were let's just say you
56:23 have a family of or a bunch of buddies
56:26 or renting a home and you're all
56:27 upstanding citizens but you're all Navy
56:29 SEAL Delta Force guys active duty so for
56:34 some reason you you you do get a chance
56:36 to sit in your home quite a bit you got
56:39 plenty of firearms in the house but you
56:41 don't because you can snap a guy's neck
56:44 with your thoughts basically because
56:45 you're so [ __ ] badass right and to
56:48 your left you got a neighbor that is
56:50 just an average American neighborhood
56:51 our neighbor and they're living a great
56:53 life and you know you don't bother
56:55 anybody you're not perfect but whatever
56:57 but to your right you've got a domestic
56:59 violence situation going on someone's
57:02 beaten up somebody the kids are getting
57:04 beat up the kids are beating each other
57:06 up there's a lot of suffering going on
57:08 you can hear the wailing and the crying
57:10 and you see people with broken arms and
57:13 black eyes and stab wounds and the
57:15 ambulances are always there
57:17 but you have a power you've got an
57:21 ability to quiet that situation and you
57:24 got a ability to do it with non-lethal
57:27 force because you're that good you're
57:32 gonna let that situation continue next
57:33 door it's your neighbor man you could
57:36 spill out
57:36 they could have a gunfight over there
57:38 and it just was this through your head
57:40 because you're standing outside watering
57:41 your lawn because you ignored what's
57:44 going on next door I don't think you
57:47 would you wouldn't have to take arms you
57:52 could you're trained to disarm people
57:53 your trade to train to educate you know
57:56 these guys are super smart autonomous
57:58 robots man they're amazing soldiers well
58:02 America has every resource and the world
58:05 to clean that joint out and give these
58:08 people modern amenities right to pave
58:11 their roads to fix their government you
58:16 know just what you do is you go and ask
58:17 the people who are good how would you
58:19 like your country to work you seem to
58:22 like America would you like it to run
58:23 like America you don't have to tell us a
58:25 different story about how you liked it
58:26 to work right we're not gonna help you
58:28 do a communist dictatorship we won't
58:30 help you do any level of dictatorship
58:31 we're kind of you know you vote for your
58:34 leaders and that's the way it works
58:36 would you like any of our rules any of
58:39 our constitution any of our regulations
58:41 like the security Exchange Commission or
58:43 something would you like any part of
58:45 what's good about us right the thing is
58:51 most people who are bullies when they
58:56 look at a formidable opponent that is
58:59 sort of a foregone conclusion about how
59:01 the fights gonna go right if I was ever
59:05 standing in the room with a Navy SEAL
59:07 and he is needing me to do something
59:12 specific and I don't think he's you know
59:15 criminal or something even if he was but
59:18 I wouldn't have much of a choice right
59:20 I'm gonna have to do what he says and
59:21 figure out when I was good or bad after
59:23 the fact right but I know I'm not going
59:26 to challenge him on a physical level for
59:28 goddamn shirt right
59:30 well that's sort of how this thing would
59:32 happen there wouldn't be necessarily a
59:34 gigantic bloodbath you promised the
59:37 people a new day you know you can
59:39 deliver and then you have a series of
59:42 meetings you work the press in that
59:45 country and in our country but um no
59:47 look we're gonna help you out but we
59:50 don't do we we don't and now there's
59:54 this weird thing where their enemy and
59:56 they're our enemy and we're gonna build
59:57 a wall and all this other kind of stuff
59:59 what's the most this is a rhetorical
60:02 question I'm going to answer for you
60:05 what's the most divide and conquer
60:07 question that's ever asked to a
60:09 politician by those who want to make
60:11 them look bad there is one question in
60:14 one question alone that's worse than all
60:18 the other questions and is what is your
60:21 opinion about abortion as soon as that
60:24 questions asked you know that the person
60:26 asking the question is trying to a hit
60:29 piece on whoever they're asking it to
60:31 because it is the most personal question
60:34 to ever be asked right on one side you
60:38 have folks that are religious and think
60:41 that regardless of what happens you have
60:44 to have that child then you have another
60:47 group that thinks that it should be
60:49 possibility if you're raped and then you
60:53 have the final group which is it should
60:56 be a viable means for birth control okay
61:00 I'm not even weighing in on where my
61:01 opinion is on this at all right it'd be
61:06 nice if it didn't have to exist there
61:07 you know any of those reasons would not
61:09 have to to be an issue that people would
61:11 always have consensual sex and they
61:13 would make babies because they want to
61:14 have babies that's what I would wish for
61:16 the entire world right but what is the
61:18 theme of that question what is the
61:20 tactic behind that question is to make
61:24 an enemy out of whoever is answering the
61:26 question because regardless of how you
61:28 answer the question there is a huge
61:32 segment of the population that will
61:34 disagree with you
61:36 if it's the religious community well you
61:38 better believe there's a giant movement
61:40 to pull your funding that's gonna be
61:42 passed around in every Church if you say
61:44 you're for it
61:46 service here against it then you're
61:48 gonna have a whole group of folks that
61:49 say you know you don't understand what
61:51 you're talking about
61:52 or you're horrible human being because
61:54 you're telling me what I can and can't
61:56 do with my own body you're screwed
61:59 you're screwed either way right isn't it
62:02 interesting that once you learn the
62:05 formula of deceit it you can never unsee
62:10 it
62:11 right the boy who call wolf the ESOP
62:15 fable about the boy who called wolf
62:17 right why do they tell us that when
62:20 we're little kids well so we don't
62:24 become that little [ __ ] who does it
62:26 right and what's really really
62:29 interesting about it is that you don't
62:33 see that in society very much where the
62:35 where the tale is taught I don't
62:38 remember anyone when I was a kid or as
62:40 an adult who faked an event to get
62:43 attention on that level right you know
62:46 you let people who you know you know
62:49 they faked being sick to get attention
62:50 from their family members or whatever
62:51 but nothing like that you saw a fable
62:54 because we teach it all right just
62:58 remember all the tales you've ever heard
63:00 about the rulers of Europe the monarchy
63:03 and I'm sure it happened in every other
63:06 region of the world but they use a war
63:09 to get the eyes off of them and to unify
63:13 their country right I'm gonna pass a lot
63:15 of tyrannical stuff you want to get rid
63:17 of a constitution you want to get rid of
63:19 the Magna Carta you start a war and you
63:24 know there's a lot of folks that are
63:25 study martial law right martial law is
63:31 always you know frowned upon unless
63:34 there's a need for it Catrina the big
63:38 was a 2007 hurricane martial law it's
63:43 the unthinkable thing that happens and
63:45 the seized weapons they went
63:46 door-to-door and broke the second
63:47 Amendment of the Constitution
63:49 the one time you need your gun to
63:52 protect yourself they were going
63:53 door-to-door to lift guns off of
63:55 law-abiding Americans with no violent
63:59 crime history of any kind stealing their
64:03 weapons those of you who are old enough
64:06 to remember Andrew Hurricane Andrew that
64:08 nailed Florida in the 80s
64:11 I remember Time Life magazine pictures
64:15 of little kids with automatic shotguns
64:18 sitting in folding chairs while their
64:20 parents are trying to drag you know some
64:22 debris around the house protecting
64:24 anybody who comes close to the home no
64:27 one was taking that kid's gun because we
64:30 wouldn't stand for it
64:31 back then but now we've been whittled
64:33 down by all these fake and real
64:36 massacres where you know guns like the
64:38 ar-15 or falsely accused of even being
64:40 involved gun controls now pivotal issue
64:44 you can find a lot of people who want
64:46 gun control that wasn't the case 4050
64:50 years ago right so let me add a little
64:54 bit of metadata before I close out this
64:55 episode the enemies that the state will
64:59 want you to hate in a lot of cases not
65:03 every single case and I think again if
65:05 America becomes more legit if we get if
65:08 we drain the swamp of all these
65:09 criminals who are basically closeted
65:11 globalists like Pelosi and those kind of
65:14 folks in McCain
65:16 the globalists will always demonize
65:19 their enemies and use fake media to make
65:24 you go along with it because you're
65:26 clearing out their obstacles so they can
65:28 take you over most of you know this
65:30 already right but it's good to remember
65:32 it that's simply right now person who
65:36 wants your well-being and the
65:38 constitutional republic that this
65:40 country was founded on in America
65:42 Republic again being your inalienable
65:43 rights that are yours because you exist
65:47 okay they will be hesitant to bring on
65:53 another enemy hesitant right now it
65:59 could be in all fairness and I do not
66:02 believe what I'm about to say I don't
66:04 have any indication of what I'm about to
66:05 hypothesize being true it's conceivable
66:11 okay that Russia could be deluded okay
66:16 after 17 18 years of Putin's rule where
66:20 he's not started any major Wars with big
66:23 countries like us right they had you
66:24 know countries that succeed seceded from
66:26 them and they definitely fought some
66:28 [ __ ] a horrible wars with them and we
66:32 I've seen some gruesome [ __ ] man
66:35 throats cut and all kinds of stuff from
66:38 these soldiers that you know were
66:41 indoctrinated into believing that this
66:43 was their enemy but it's it's potential
66:46 there's a potential for a crazy leader
66:49 to get in charge of a country and and
66:51 make bad things happen if you think that
66:55 Putin is horrible you need to go watch
66:57 his interviews he does with his press
67:00 world press
67:02 I shouldn't say his press but world
67:03 press everyone's invited orders just
67:06 their EP is there he's very calm cool
67:08 and collected I don't know the guy I
67:10 don't know if he's horrible good or bad
67:12 but I haven't seen anything that's
67:14 chaotic I haven't seen anything that's
67:18 you know reactionary with that guy he
67:22 seems to be extremely collected there's
67:26 another guy Assad the ruler of Syria
67:30 right the Assad family has been running
67:32 that country for several generations
67:34 guys I think speaks about six languages
67:37 he's educated in Europe and he takes a
67:41 press conference with a whole group of
67:43 people from around Europe and he not
67:46 only answers their questions calm cool
67:48 and collected and very intelligently he
67:51 speaks in the native language if he can
67:52 to the reporter who asks the question he
67:55 even encourages them to ask him in
67:57 French in German in English and he
68:00 answers back as best he can in their
68:03 language that's pretty cool right so
68:07 it's not that we can't have a ruler go
68:09 crazy maybe King Jung is actually doing
68:12 the things that they're saying he's
68:14 doing perhaps he's actually saying the
68:16 things that he's saying if he is then we
68:19 obviously know he's been in bubble so
68:21 much in his lifetime he's utterly
68:22 delusional we would be too if we had
68:25 such power and the ability to
68:28 encapsulate ourselves in our own dogma
68:30 but we have allies all over that place
68:33 to his north he's got Russia and China
68:36 he ain't gonna start anything with
68:38 Russia or China and he needs Russia and
68:40 China to keep his people life remember
68:42 as I've had it communicated to me North
68:45 Korea has to import 65% of their
68:48 strategic resources just to remain
68:50 functional meaning if those resources
68:52 don't come in people starve to death
68:54 people freeze to death it's a big deal
68:58 it's a lot different right so China slip
69:00 in them a little bit of oil in my
69:02 opinion I get it I get it it's not it's
69:06 not good public relations for China but
69:09 I understand if they're looking at
69:11 thinking you know if looking at saying
69:12 look
69:13 it's like that neighbor that bad
69:15 neighbor example I gave you if if the
69:17 father is starving his children or being
69:21 such an [ __ ] that he has to borrow
69:23 ingredients from the neighbors to keep
69:25 his kids alive well the neighbor might
69:26 take him a turkey and say you know I
69:30 know you guys hate this guy your
69:32 neighbor I understand I completely
69:33 support you and I think he's a horrible
69:35 person but if I don't give him this
69:36 Turkey
69:37 those kids those innocent children who
69:39 live under his rule of to death and so
69:43 until we come up with the solution I'm
69:46 gonna give them what they need to
69:47 survive right obviously oil could be
69:50 used for military reasons etc but it's
69:54 one of those moral dilemmas right but we
69:57 got a we got to pull our heads out and
69:58 join their movement and set an example
70:01 for what they should do which is we have
70:03 to be extremely apprehensive about
70:07 pulling in who we think is a new enemy
70:10 for our country to to engage now it
70:16 might be that North Korea has crossed
70:18 some serious lines and we have to step
70:21 in and once and for all working with our
70:24 allies China and Russia I have to move
70:26 in you know South Korea being involved -
70:29 we really want to just defend Seoul at
70:31 this point right we wipe out the
70:33 aggressive regions that could hurt Seoul
70:35 right away we wipe out the DMZ we take
70:39 out the government how will we do it we
70:41 ask them politely to leave and if they
70:42 don't we get more aggressive China I
70:46 think I've had it communicated to me
70:48 hasn't declared war on anyone in like
70:50 400 years but there's all this rhetoric
70:53 about how they're gonna start a war with
70:55 the United States they're gonna get all
70:56 uppity you know they're not gonna steal
70:58 they're not gonna do that they're
70:59 they're using all of our manufacturing
71:01 to stay alive right what happens if we
71:05 go to war with China well I don't know
71:07 how many of their exports come from
71:08 United States companies but but it's a
71:10 hell of a lot but it's enough to crash
71:13 their stock market not gonna play games
71:15 like that China's not stupid you know
71:18 this Trump has said many times they're
71:20 not stupid then believe it Russia isn't
71:23 stupid either
71:25 apparently the Middle East is a lot
71:27 smarter than we
71:27 - per the propaganda that we hear about
71:30 them right about a good change is going
71:33 on so tremendous amount of rebuilding so
71:36 lastly what we have to think about is
71:40 there's that old thing that happened on
71:43 television back in the day doesn't
71:44 happen that often anymore but there's
71:46 that old saying that used to say if a
71:48 football game went too far out of its
71:51 programming socket but it's the World
71:52 Series and they just gotta keep going
71:54 it's a 15 inning World Series and it's
71:57 eating into the next sitcom or the next
71:59 show they'll say you're joining a
72:03 progress film a show already in progress
72:05 right and you've missed the first 20
72:07 minutes of the show because they just
72:08 couldn't make up the timeslot right we
72:11 are joining those of us who are awake we
72:15 are joining a program already in session
72:19 if we were able to drain the swamp and
72:22 replace them with superhumans you know
72:24 the most ethical amazing brilliant human
72:27 beings they still would be challenged
72:30 with the clean up
72:31 there are plenty soldiers around the
72:33 world in all countries who have fought
72:35 other countries successfully and even
72:36 one who come home and live in a world of
72:39 regret for decades and decades until
72:41 they pass away that they have created
72:43 enemies in a foreign country they've
72:45 killed innocent people because they were
72:47 fed propaganda we have to repair
72:50 relationships in these areas where we
72:53 have created this horrible sentiment
72:56 what do you do if you were to buy into
72:58 this propaganda about Russia and you you
73:02 even get on board with this whole thing
73:04 about impeach a president because you
73:05 want to accuse him of something that's
73:07 never been proven this collusion which
73:09 again is even if that were true it's not
73:10 a crime and then you meet a bus full of
73:16 Russian kids young kids you know they've
73:19 done anything they have enjoined the
73:21 military they haven't killed anybody
73:22 there's still teenagers and you look
73:24 them in the face after going along with
73:26 this our presidents so bad because they
73:28 talked to your leader they talked to
73:30 your country and I've been told you're a
73:32 bad country I've got nothing to base it
73:34 on but fake media mainstream media fake
73:39 news right
73:40 what do you say to those kids what do
73:44 you say to him
73:44 you're bad these kids are like what are
73:46 you talking about we don't Playstations
73:48 we were the latest clothing we dried a
73:51 dress like you guys we did your fashion
73:53 by the way we've got a couple trends of
73:54 our own you got a couple dance styles we
73:56 have break dance contest - we shred
73:59 guitars because we like metal music we
74:00 like Raph we like it all what are you
74:02 talking about
74:03 we're as modern as you are or at least
74:06 we're trying to be it would level any
74:10 ones attempt to demonize these people
74:13 and that's what the internet is doing
74:15 but again the old [ __ ] that run this
74:19 world are ignoring what's going on our
74:22 level because they don't have the
74:23 pastimes that we have they're not
74:26 looking at how much we know about these
74:28 fabled enemies I have a very close
74:31 family friend of mine that lives in
74:33 China he's lived there for seven years
74:34 now shinjin he has opened up his own
74:39 little art gallery he teaches classes
74:42 sometimes formally but most of time
74:44 informally they like him to go around
74:46 the village he speaks no Chinese they
74:48 speak most of them speak a little bit
74:50 English but they love him because he's
74:53 bringing sort of the Western culture
74:54 over there he's bringing them art
74:58 expression now they're already doing it
75:00 on their own okay but they like his
75:03 different take on things they like how
75:05 he teaches perfectionism and refinement
75:07 something that they don't get other
75:08 native culture unless they look over at
75:11 the West and see things coming and
75:12 really polished and really nice and like
75:14 you know and I'm gonna work an extra day
75:16 an extra week an extra month an extra
75:18 year on this thing to make it just as
75:19 good as my Western buddies and they have
75:22 realized very quickly that the more they
75:24 take things too that finer perfection
75:26 moment that step becomes shorter and
75:29 quicker and faster for them so what used
75:32 to take a year six months six months
75:33 because three etc all the way down so
75:36 they're getting good at it it's their
75:37 younger generation over there
75:39 that's reengineering China it's
75:42 beautiful it's happening in Russia right
75:45 so depending on your age bracket you may
75:48 already be hip to this whole thing I
75:50 shut this thing off a long time ago if
75:51 you're my generation your 40s and up
75:54 there's probably a lot of re-engineering
75:56 that needs to go on in the mind but I
75:57 thought it would be good to have an
75:59 episode right break it down and
76:01 hopefully give you some some talking
76:04 points right where you use your brain
76:06 your opinions about these things and
76:09 simply realize that we're living in this
76:11 kind of dying phase of the rocket engine
76:15 of yesteryear this cold war dogma that
76:18 we still have these arch enemies all
76:20 over the world well what would happen
76:22 okay if we didn't have an enemies what
76:26 would happen well why do we have big
76:29 governments and big armies why does the
76:32 UN I feel like they need to build up
76:35 their UN army a world army it's their
76:38 [ __ ] dream dude trust me because they
76:42 think as long as you can believe you've
76:44 got an enemy you need their services to
76:46 protect you that's the game and as long
76:51 if we can get together and become
76:53 friends okay and there's some factions
76:56 in the world that we have been warned
76:58 about by people that are in those
77:00 factions that we still need to be very
77:03 alert over because they're also carrying
77:06 their own form of dogma so the world is
77:08 not going to become a bowl of cherries
77:09 overnight but what if we just throw this
77:13 little scenario at you what if America
77:15 the big world superpower becomes really
77:19 really indigenous good friends with
77:22 Russia and China right then there's such
77:29 a stabilizing force in the world that if
77:31 the EU wants to exacerbate the UN to say
77:35 we need this world army world army now
77:37 again their whole thing is like full
77:38 integration don't need to be hate
77:40 anybody
77:40 they shouldn't be pushing for this well
77:43 for all friends somehow someway then we
77:48 don't need these armies to protect us
77:49 like we like we have today there might
77:52 be decades away from this euphoric
77:55 option I'm giving here at the end but if
77:58 we don't start today we don't know how
78:00 long it's going to take to get to this
78:02 better world we don't
78:04 and we need to know we need to know so
78:09 we've got a little personal goal I think
78:11 a citizen's to you know be cautious but
78:15 to be smart about it
78:17 the some of these are so ridiculous
78:20 some of these are so off the chart
78:22 yesteryear that I think that a giant
78:25 portion of the the Allied forces that we
78:29 can intellectually come to in the next
78:31 five to ten years probably even two
78:34 years with Russia we're already pretty
78:36 good friends with China right it will be
78:40 such a sour centrifuge to our moral
78:44 dilemma in the world that it will start
78:46 making these armies look really stupid
78:48 right sure a protect your homeland right
78:51 you need to have just in case someone
78:53 surprises you and tries to throw a
78:55 terrorist attack at you or tries to
78:56 surprise invade you hey
78:58 just build up your Navy build up your
79:00 local forces make sure they know how to
79:02 protect your native land learn the land
79:04 learn where the resources are make your
79:07 plans on how to do something but in the
79:09 end maybe it becomes a big bore fest
79:12 maybe it stimulates the economy for five
79:15 to ten years as we ramp up a bunch of
79:17 military stuff but in the end we find
79:18 out man this is pretty cool but here's
79:22 the thing leadership changes in
79:25 democratically elected countries coos
79:29 happen those bankers are never going to
79:32 stop until they are utterly eliminated
79:34 off the face of this planet and their
79:35 mechanism of valuing money through
79:37 petrol dollar goes away until education
79:40 is improved in all countries such the
79:44 people want to go for their own personal
79:45 destiny and not some government handout
79:48 job right where welfare is sort of a
79:52 concept of yesteryear welfare would be
79:55 reserved for people maybe are mentally
79:57 handicapped and they simply cannot hold
79:59 down a job and so we have social
80:01 programs to help those are literally
80:04 genetically challenged from living a
80:06 normal life but everyone else who's of
80:08 working age
80:10 you don't have to sell drugs they don't
80:12 have to stick up anybody doesn't matter
80:15 what race they are they can get a bank
80:17 loan just like anybody they can have a
80:19 life they can live in whatever
80:20 neighborhood they want you know it's
80:24 it's really funny that people who have
80:27 struggled to come out of racism they
80:31 typically tell the story in that they'll
80:34 say well my neighborhood there's a
80:36 so-and-so race a person from that race
80:38 and that the only person on our street
80:39 of that race but you know what was nice
80:41 about him they were so educated so
80:43 polite they just integrated beautifully
80:45 with our neighborhood there was never
80:46 any problems all right education was the
80:49 reason why it was a total seamless
80:51 integration but it's the one that moves
80:54 in that's of a particular race that's
80:56 not yours doesn't have to be any one
80:57 specific that they were they were
81:00 regressed they didn't they came from
81:03 maybe a poverty-stricken country and
81:06 they didn't know how to engage modern
81:09 amenities and they took the house that
81:11 was beautiful and it just was destroyed
81:14 the house behind my house was being
81:17 rented by a family of that that
81:20 unfortunate nature and they demolished
81:23 the home they did all kinds of weird
81:26 things that they would do in their
81:27 native country and if there's an episode
81:29 we can hear a saw going off that was the
81:33 owner of that house rebuilding that
81:34 house because the renter's had destroyed
81:36 it it happens right but education
81:39 probably would have made that not happen
81:42 and we have to think about this right in
81:48 America we have you know this No Child
81:50 Left Behind which is what I like to call
81:52 the every child left behind'
81:53 educational system well 60 years ago
81:57 America had it down pat we were
82:00 educating kids that turned out to make
82:02 all those amazing movies in America that
82:04 happened from 1975 to 1985 all this
82:07 crazy amazing music that still plays in
82:09 restaurants today nobody plays modern
82:12 music and restaurants and your elevators
82:14 right they always play the classics and
82:16 the kids are now starting to rediscover
82:17 the classics because they're like today
82:20 we don't have any music we really don't
82:22 have any music we're going back
82:23 we like to be able to sing a song when
82:27 the song is over we're singing it in the
82:28 car we're singing it in the shower they
82:30 just get stuck in our head the song
82:33 still happened today but that used to
82:34 happen in droves you know movies are
82:39 horrible you know they're horrible you
82:41 know but horrible because education
82:43 sucks that's why people don't know how
82:45 to write a movie they want to make a
82:47 movie directors are getting famous
82:49 making horrible movie after a horrible
82:51 movie and their name brand mu a name
82:54 brand directors that they're horrible at
82:57 making movies right and the only reason
82:59 why they get at alkylate is because the
83:01 special effects were good the
83:03 soundtracks were good why the special
83:05 effects and soundtracks good because
83:07 those people are educated that's why
83:09 they have no choice you can't get in
83:11 those industries without being educated
83:13 and knowing how to move the soul with
83:15 music move the soul with you know super
83:19 complicated special effects I think you
83:23 feel me I could probably talk forever
83:25 this is a pretty cool location yeah it's
83:28 about 55 degrees outside so this is much
83:32 better than being wrapped up in four
83:34 coats my backyard so I might resort to
83:37 this during the rest of this winter and
83:40 of course because global warming is real
83:41 we're experiencing the coldest winter in
83:44 many regions of America right more
83:48 propaganda so anyway if you dig the show
83:52 please visit deep thoughts radio com
83:55 that really has all the feeds that are
83:56 out there your video choices are now
83:58 down to YouTube that dummy went out of
84:00 business really crappy I start
84:02 increasing my vid me you know accolades
84:05 and bumpers at the end and then they go
84:07 out of business
84:10 iTunes and Google Play also have the
84:13 podcast it's really tough to find it in
84:15 Google Play but it is on there if you
84:17 can get to the podcast feed on that I
84:19 think it's a little easier to find on
84:20 the website but screw all that stuff
84:22 regardless of what device you have just
84:24 go to it with your cell phone that's
84:26 probably we're gonna dispatch this if
84:28 your audio listener in the car whatever
84:30 and just click on the RSS feed I think
84:33 it's the bottom right icon when the
84:34 icons show up on the page and it will
84:36 load up and can
84:37 to your phone beautifully there's a
84:40 patreon account for those of you who are
84:42 into donating I do apologize for being a
84:45 little slow during the winter I've been
84:47 doing a tremendous amount of business on
84:49 my end so it's completely eat up eating
84:52 up my time but I'm gonna be getting back
84:53 my normal slots here so I can finish up
84:57 this season you know the 50 episodes do
84:59 you look I got a lot of great ideas for
85:03 episodes some of them require a lot of
85:05 research on my end and I've done a lot
85:08 of like I've done about 2/3 of research
85:10 on at least half a dozen topics I need
85:13 to finish off the last third make my
85:15 notes I probably have to actually paste
85:18 up a few bullet items in front of me
85:20 just to be able to make sure I don't go
85:21 off the rails like I did probably in
85:23 this episode I also added a PayPal link
85:26 up there no one's used PayPal yet but I
85:29 guess patreon takes a lot of taxes for
85:32 people in Europe and so if you want to
85:34 switch over I'm told there's less
85:37 v.a.t.s right so anyway if you made it
85:41 this far thanks for listening I will see
85:43 you in the next deep thoughts take care
85:44 of yourself and someone else I got that
85:46 all backwards but we're gonna leave it
85:47 right there see you soon
