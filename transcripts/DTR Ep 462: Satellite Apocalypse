00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen get myself a little short
00:35 stick here it is a super cheapy stick
00:40 that was called oh yeah
00:44 it's called blenders gold I have never
00:47 seen this before actually sorry I have
00:49 seen this but it's been my local
00:50 Walgreens which is a little drug store
00:52 we have here
00:53 British people called the chemist and
00:59 it's easily used - it's probably
01:02 god-awful stick but it's also fairly
01:05 short so we'll keep this episode
01:07 hopefully around an hour we'll see I
01:09 don't have a timer anymore because my
01:11 computer is not being used to record the
01:14 audio anymore it's probably horrible
01:16 we'll give it a try
01:18 but today I as promised in a previous
01:21 sentence in a previous episode I want to
01:25 discuss with you guys the the subject of
01:29 satellites
01:30 well definitely tell it's short filler
01:33 as soon as I cracked it open it was
01:37 parsing pieces into my mouth okay
01:41 satellites obviously there's two groups
01:44 of people out there different sizes
01:46 there's a group that absolutely
01:48 positively believes in satellites and
01:50 there's a group that tends to not think
01:53 they're real because of all the other
01:54 lies and stuff that we hear from NASA
01:58 and there's some people that but I would
02:02 say that you know to the most popular
02:04 groups are your heliocentric globe
02:07 earthers which believed in the classic
02:09 ball earth that is myself I'm not doing
02:13 that to get with the crowd I'm an
02:15 expanding earth person please see my
02:16 episode on expanding earth but then we
02:20 have a group of individuals who have
02:22 dared to think for themselves
02:23 called the flat earthers and I root them
02:27 on constantly and you know there are
02:34 varying levels within the Flat Earth
02:36 group and I get for those of you really
02:38 just off at this this episodes for both
02:40 of you so don't think this is one way or
02:42 the other but I do think that there's
02:44 potentially a PSYOP out there regardless
02:50 of what you believe and it's a very
02:55 dangerous I up and that would be if you
02:58 don't believe in satellites now to my
03:03 flat earthers you still believe that
03:06 there's an object called the moon and an
03:08 object called the Sun that hovers over a
03:10 disc 3,200 miles up approximately as the
03:13 Sexton dictated for hundreds of years
03:16 maybe even thousands of years and
03:20 because nASA has faked going to the moon
03:23 I believe they faked nearly all space
03:26 travel including the Mars rovers and all
03:29 of the reconnaissance Voyager satellites
03:31 and anything else the Titan moon
03:34 reconnaissance lander and me just
03:36 everything because in my privileged
03:40 realm and my coherent realm I had
03:44 noticed that the evolution of Hollywood
03:47 technology happened to coincide with
03:50 NASA's discoveries 2001 a Space Odyssey
03:54 comes out just prior to the moon
03:56 missions being real now again I've
04:00 worked with Vivian Kubrick now for at
04:01 least a year her and I spent four
04:04 exhausted months and she was 100% you
04:09 know forthcoming about all the
04:12 information and we were able to deduce
04:15 that Stanley couldn't have really
04:19 participated in anything and I had up an
04:21 episode in 26 and 165 where I said that
04:24 that was the case I am wrong and so
04:28 there's a million reasons why probably
04:30 the biggest reason why other than him
04:32 not traveling to these locations and
04:35 being extremely busy and projects right
04:38 up until the moon mission and the fact
04:39 that he was in his living room when this
04:41 went down and can you imagine the guy
04:44 that's orchestrating the hoax is in his
04:46 living room that's pretty good
04:49 he was also very excited that that this
04:52 went on the air and one could say oh
04:53 he's excited because he he'll fake it
04:55 now the the shining has a very revealing
05:00 scene where Danny is you know walking up
05:03 to this room 236 there sorry 237 excuse
05:06 me it was 2 1 7 I believe in the book
05:10 little kid is playing on a hexagonal
05:13 carpet he stands up with Apollo 11 on
05:16 his chest and walks 237 Oh technically
05:22 units you might say it's not really the
05:24 case but he walks to 237 some people
05:26 scramble the letters on the lock to say
05:29 moon room insinuating that Stanley
05:33 saying I participated in this now in my
05:36 opinion I think 2001 a Space Odyssey was
05:39 Greenland 65 fueled by arthur c clarke
05:42 who came out of NASA after being a
05:44 science fiction writer for so long he
05:47 was a genius I mean our thirsty Clark
05:49 admitted the geocentric orbit the theory
05:52 of it that became my guest true Stanley
05:56 could have been making a statement but
05:57 again the Vivian Kubrick worked in the
06:00 art department of The Shining and she
06:02 was tasked with finding the carpet she
06:04 brought a bunch of samples back from
06:06 London and her father just immediately
06:09 just came over and just thumb through
06:10 them really quickly and was like man I
06:11 don't like any of these he specifically
06:13 said find me a very loud carpet when
06:16 that exercise failed and he loved his
06:18 daughter more than anything that one of
06:20 the reasons why we know he didn't travel
06:21 to United States as rumored was that he
06:25 always took Vivian with him and he
06:26 didn't fly on planes because he had a
06:28 fear of dying on a plane and so her
06:32 passport looks just like his passport he
06:35 was only here in the spring of 68 to to
06:38 promote his movie and back on a boat
06:39 back to England so people like to think
06:43 that the United States government used a
06:45 British film studio so that Kubrick
06:49 could shoot the shots over in England
06:51 that's got to be one of the most absurd
06:54 assertions you're putting literally one
06:57 of the most clandestine lies in history
07:00 in England
07:01 you would never do that as the United
07:03 States government it's all filmed in
07:05 various locations I think they used to
07:07 some studios near area 51 and some sets
07:12 in area 51 because they did build groom
07:14 Lake replicas at area 51 before the moon
07:17 landing so it's a perfect place to shoot
07:19 the shoot the scene and because there's
07:21 no flyovers allowed by 1969 it's a
07:26 perfect place to shoot everything and no
07:28 one's allowed to be there
07:29 how convenient they did then before 51
07:33 was there it was a bomb test site for
07:35 nuclear bombs and so it also has a bunch
07:37 of craters created by nuclear bombs so
07:40 that's also convenient but the the
07:44 carpet was essentially a guy standing
07:47 next to Vivian and her father and he
07:49 goes well you know because he was upset
07:52 he didn't see what he wanted and so the
07:53 guy goes look I'll just come up with
07:55 something really quick okay so Vivian
07:57 and this guy go back to the art room she
07:59 watches and put together a sexagon old
08:00 pattern shows it to her father boom it's
08:02 good so it wasn't a lot of premeditation
08:05 make it look like that this is Apollo 11
08:07 launch pads as far as the sweater goes
08:10 it was a friend of the family this
08:12 Italian fashion designer who had worked
08:14 with him for several movies before that
08:17 she was sitting in the room with Vivian
08:20 she goes I I've been tested create and
08:23 knit this sweater for the Danny
08:25 character and I don't know I'm not from
08:26 America what a little boys like in
08:28 America and her boyfriends in the room
08:30 it says well they just landed on the
08:32 moon just do something you know Rakesh
08:34 so she created that sweater while
08:36 talking to everybody for a couple days
08:37 and boom she was done
08:39 why knit a sweater from scratch because
08:41 you avoid all the copyright problems the
08:43 fashion designers can come and rip you
08:45 off later on that's why the carpet was
08:48 also originally created no copyright
08:52 problems they built that whole Overlook
08:54 Hotel interior in England as far as two
08:58 three seven being changed at 2:37 the
09:02 hotel called and said do not make it
09:05 room two one seven please we've got that
09:07 room we don't want to be anyone afraid
09:09 to stay there the fallacy that they
09:11 created was that they forgot to tell
09:14 Stanley what other room
09:15 wanted him to use so he's just annoyed
09:17 he's filming he's you know he's a
09:18 perfectionist he's doing you know
09:21 anywhere from 20 takes on a particular
09:24 shot to you know potentially 100 takes
09:26 on a shot he doesn't have time for this
09:27 stupid stuff and so he just said well
09:30 fine make it through 237 it was that
09:33 easy
09:33 that's how Stanley rolled with a lot of
09:35 the ancillary stuff now does Stanley
09:38 embed image systems that are super deep
09:41 in his movies of course he does
09:42 he's a genius but Vivian told me look
09:46 you have to understand that my father's
09:48 genius was fluid he just flowed like
09:51 that butts Putin it goes up in the late
09:55 50s this thing they call a satellite it
09:59 is hurling across the sky so quickly
10:02 that no plane could do it and no balloon
10:05 could do it in fact it's hurtling across
10:08 the sky faster than any moon or Sun
10:11 model and a Flat Earth model can can
10:14 account for a ton of people listen to
10:17 Sputnik not just government officials
10:19 any with a ham radio could pick up its
10:22 did too did that you know whatever the
10:24 hell was doing down to earth so a very
10:28 real event occurs that proves the
10:30 satellites are capable of being shoved
10:32 up there in the atmosphere and beaming
10:35 information down now that was just a
10:38 proof of concept
10:39 there was no surveillance in that thing
10:42 we didn't have the camera systems we
10:43 have today or a lot of the other
10:45 technology that we have today and even
10:47 if we did have it on earth we hadn't put
10:48 it in a satellite yet now some people
10:51 say oh it's balloons man it's balloons
10:53 well balloons do exist
10:55 they're called Satta loons officially by
10:58 the early 60s they had launched a saddle
11:00 um okay but this episode is about the
11:04 belief of satellites or the non-belief
11:06 of satellites now we watch movies like
11:11 The Matrix and other movies where there
11:14 are essentially surveillance situations
11:17 even believe it or not The Truman Show
11:20 sort of had a satellite control system
11:23 which was this moon that was hovering in
11:25 the sky where Ed Harris's character is
11:28 in the moon and it's the editing Bay for
11:31 the entire live broadcast of this Truman
11:33 character of which was in a dome and
11:36 everyone's outside the dome watching the
11:39 movie watching this live reality show
11:42 what a brilliant movie that is but in
11:45 the Truman Show you have a character
11:47 played by Jim Carrey who is being
11:49 essentially controlled by this this TV
11:52 show okay but he didn't know the moon
11:58 was a command center now there are
12:02 theories about the moon that make it a
12:06 Space Station either a surface Space
12:08 Station or if you study David Icke he
12:10 thinks it's completely full of a
12:12 gigantic Space Station inside people do
12:17 cite the fact that Plato talks about a
12:19 time before the moon as if earth didn't
12:21 have it and then suddenly it had it okay
12:24 I think it's very strange I think it's a
12:28 very strange satellite around the earth
12:29 it is just you know that if one it's an
12:33 elliptical orbit it's farthest distance
12:35 from Earth is 237 a belief but it's
12:40 elliptical so it's kind of an egg shape
12:42 orbit right it's it's not perfectly
12:44 circular but even in this elliptical
12:47 orbit it manages to keep the same face
12:49 facing earth and if it had any variation
12:53 in its spin versus its orbit over time
12:56 over a thousand years a hundred years we
12:58 would start to see a new section of the
13:01 moon on one side and the old section
13:03 would start to rotate away not the case
13:06 as far as I know and like anyone's claim
13:08 that they're seeing more of a particular
13:11 volcanic eruption they call craters on
13:14 the surface of the Moon in my lifetime
13:16 or in recorded history yet it is capable
13:21 of perfectly eclipsing the Sun which is
13:23 supposedly some random 93 million miles
13:25 away the odds of that are probably the
13:30 odds of us again you know throwing a
13:34 grain of sand from one touchdown zone on
13:38 one side of the football field to
13:40 another touchdown zone there's two
13:42 people throwing a
13:43 - and having them hit each other at the
13:45 50-yard line I think that those odds are
13:48 astronomically against impossible truly
13:51 impossible yet this is the reality that
13:54 we accept so I say all those things one
13:57 to clear out Kubrick so we don't get
13:59 lost in this whole thing and the other
14:02 one is to say well there are some funky
14:03 things about our immediate planet moon
14:06 Sun that you get everyone who's so sure
14:10 about everything yeah sort of towards
14:13 the fence because a lot of people like
14:16 to feel superior to saying you're so
14:18 stupid you believe something different
14:19 again genius is holding two opposing
14:21 concepts in your mind without shooting
14:23 yourself I'm gonna repeat that a lot for
14:25 the last half of the season all right
14:29 but now let's come back down to earth
14:31 and let's look at some inventions that
14:33 we have on the surface of earth we have
14:36 laser technology which is capable of
14:39 doing well thermal izing anything we
14:43 have directed energy weapons that can do
14:46 things like make you feel like you're on
14:47 fire if you're in a crowd but if you do
14:51 turn it up you could tune it to titanium
14:54 aluminum steel lead whatever you can
14:58 resonate effectively would probably not
15:00 so much because it is not molecularly
15:03 dense enough to shake but mmm you know I
15:07 wouldn't put it past and having figured
15:09 out a way to do it but we know we can
15:10 melt any steel with a beam of energy
15:13 we definitely have missiles of all kinds
15:16 all kinds of conventional missiles with
15:19 all kinds of SuperDuper you know you
15:23 know c4 type thing c4 is ancient stuff
15:25 man they've got stuff that's ten times
15:27 hundred times thousand times more
15:28 powerful there was a big Moab that we
15:31 drop it's got some pretty
15:33 state-of-the-art stuff in it and if you
15:36 believe all the specs that are published
15:38 you might be being you might have been
15:41 had I feel like oh man I know all the
15:43 specs for the Moab it's think maybe you
15:45 do maybe you don't
15:47 yield is the only thing that they need
15:49 to really communicate with their enemies
15:50 right this thing can liquefy human
15:54 beings three miles away so just be care
15:56 and everyone else will be so mentally
15:59 shaken that they'll be useless for the
16:00 rest of their lives but we have had
16:03 science fiction show after science
16:05 fiction TV show showing you various
16:08 mechanisms by which human beings
16:10 completely operate ignorant of a control
16:13 apparatus on top of them the matrix is
16:16 one of the best these people are
16:19 technically in a computer and they don't
16:22 know it again I just talked about this
16:26 in my intelligence threshold episode we
16:29 have had sci-fi movies like Terminator 2
16:32 which reveal the details of the Skynet
16:35 system which is the futuristic take over
16:38 the world by machines and there's plenty
16:43 of video games that do this and so once
16:46 it's in the sort of the lexicon or the
16:49 vocabulary or the paradigm can
16:51 conception of man that official realm
16:54 you better believe there's people in the
16:56 government that either fed that story to
16:59 individuals that snuck out retired and
17:02 wrote science fiction and of course the
17:04 beautiful value to the Defense
17:06 Department of any simulation of this
17:09 sort of category is that they get to see
17:12 the simulation portrayed to the world a
17:15 lot of thinkers you know from creative
17:16 3d artists to writers coming up with
17:19 potential scenarios and then they air it
17:22 on television or in a silver screen and
17:24 they watch the public react to it you
17:27 might be in a review session with
17:29 someone and they're you know trying to
17:32 get to trying to get your opinion of a
17:33 movie of a story and the only thing that
17:35 they're really trying to do is figure
17:36 out how you're reacting to this real
17:38 story because they've got the real
17:40 technology I just re-watched the
17:43 interview with the von braun's
17:46 secretary Verna von Braun was the
17:51 brainchild of the v1 of v2 rockets he
17:54 was the brainchild of all the rocketry
17:57 that NASA created to get to the Saturn 5
18:01 which fueled the hoax to the moon by the
18:04 way that rocket I mean I just watched
18:06 another reel of it launching and you
18:08 know it never blew up the Saturn 5 never
18:10 blew
18:11 and that's a tremendous accomplishment
18:14 considering they launched did you know
18:16 what ten times phenomenal seven trips to
18:21 the moon where men were supposed to get
18:23 off 13 doesn't do it but eight nine and
18:25 ten also did it s ten amazing it's
18:31 pretty much a bulletproof rocket at a
18:34 time when two years earlier Rockets was
18:36 blowing up on the tarmac and Russia's
18:39 last moon mission rocket blew up it blew
18:44 up so bad they canceled the whole
18:45 program because they realized the Delta
18:48 between not getting it to blow up and
18:50 then going into orbit and trying to
18:52 escape orbits go to the moon they said
18:54 look we have more thrust power than the
18:58 Saturn five because our Rockets smaller
18:59 than Saturn five we can't escape Earth's
19:01 orbit and in 1995 NASA starts buying
19:05 their old motors that they built in 1973
19:07 off the Russians but we hate the
19:09 Russians of course because they're so
19:10 bad okay so we also have things like the
19:16 Hubble telescope I don't believe the
19:20 Hubble telescope exists at all I believe
19:24 it is the Sofia 747 with the same exact
19:28 optics in it and they'll tell you the
19:29 Sofia 747 has the same telescope in it
19:33 that Hubble has we had a mistake a
19:36 couple years ago where a picture of I
19:39 believe it was Jupiter was released from
19:42 the Hubble from the Sofia and from an
19:44 observatory in germany all claiming to
19:47 have taken the same photograph and
19:51 obviously it couldn't have been that way
19:53 one of them did and two of them didn't
19:57 the gentleman that called NASA up from
20:00 from Caltech and said you know he was a
20:02 machine-learning kid he's a grown man
20:06 sound like to me on the phone but he
20:07 published his phone call and he talked
20:09 to this dude-ness and said you know this
20:11 this international database of all
20:13 launches such that we don't launch on
20:16 the same day get in each other's way so
20:18 that we can track debris and just know
20:20 what's in space versus what's fallen and
20:23 that sort of thing he's
20:24 I can't find the Hubble telescope
20:25 launched the launch doesn't exist which
20:29 I believe was 93 I think he says what I
20:32 do see the database is are the space
20:34 shuttle launches that claim to be
20:36 repairing the Hubble telescope hmm why
20:41 would that have launched and had a
20:43 problem immediately and then be repaired
20:45 later we'll remember NASA's in the
20:47 picture game if they can't 3d render or
20:50 have an artist create the photographs
20:53 that are going to convince the
20:54 population that a vehicles in space then
20:57 they have to come up with an excuse why
20:59 they're gonna have to have a multi month
21:01 delay a multi year delay until they get
21:04 it right then it'll be incredible right
21:08 they'll have this ILM engine inside NASA
21:11 to create faintness that's why I think
21:15 the 98 Rover to Mars crashed because I
21:19 think that they knew that they were
21:20 going to be biting off a lot more data a
21:23 lot more images it was supposed to last
21:25 a lot longer and they simply didn't have
21:27 the fake imagery to sell to the public
21:29 so they waited three years to relaunch
21:32 and get it back out here and of course
21:35 they have a couple years to wait until
21:37 it lands and then does its thing I was
21:39 in the house here when one of them
21:41 landed but now they've run you know 18
21:45 years and they're only supposed to run
21:47 11 months it's a profit machine we sell
21:50 pictures they buy it we get sixty
21:53 million dollars a day and our subsidiary
21:55 Jet Propulsion Laboratory or I should
21:56 say Jack Parsons laboratory makes
22:00 another chunk of cash the reason why
22:03 flat earther should believe in
22:04 satellites is because you believe that
22:06 the moon and the Sun are up there you
22:08 can't explain it there's this buoyancy
22:11 thing which may or may not have anything
22:13 to do with anything but if you want to
22:18 redraw everything from a sphere to a
22:21 disk then let's acknowledge the fact
22:25 that there's two giant objects up there
22:26 regardless of how small you think they
22:29 are on how close you think they are to
22:30 the surface they're up there so we
22:31 should be able to usurp the science of
22:33 that if there are little pieces of
22:35 machine up there
22:38 saying that their satellites up there
22:41 which is what I'm gonna suggest on this
22:42 show does not mean that everything else
22:44 they've said that's up there is up there
22:45 so I'm not saying one validates the
22:48 other but here's my concern that I
22:51 alluded to in a previous episode if you
22:55 are convinced that these things can
22:56 exist and all this incredible technology
23:00 both the technology are fully aware of
23:02 and technology that you're not aware of
23:03 goes into space then you might be in for
23:10 a big ride and not a good one you might
23:14 even have a leader that's elected that
23:16 you think is capable of man handling all
23:20 of this globalism and control apparatus
23:24 down at least over your country and it's
23:28 not true who knows now I had a very good
23:33 friend of mine who worked on some pretty
23:35 covert satellite technology I learned
23:39 all about it I learned about all of its
23:41 stages and it's really sort of boring
23:44 today if I would review what I learned I
23:46 won't reveal it there's no reason to but
23:51 I did hold in my hand as I've alluded to
23:53 or Danny admitted to several episodes
23:54 several hundred episodes ago a schematic
23:57 of this thing and it was very real it
24:03 was very well thought out it wasn't a
24:06 gen one I don't even know what
24:07 generation it was but had definitely
24:09 been the result of some some tests that
24:12 had failed but they got it right and
24:16 this thing was supposedly deployed in
24:17 space by 1988 and if you remember the
24:20 space shuttle launches it's very
24:22 important we were always sold a bill of
24:26 goods if the space shuttle is coming up
24:27 with all these experiments where you're
24:29 gonna find different metals that can
24:32 form zero-gravity and form better plant
24:35 life and space blah blah blah man in
24:38 space but very shortly after the space
24:42 shuttle program started I'm gonna guess
24:46 just for my recollection as a kid
24:48 probably two-thirds of these launches
24:50 were covert so you see the space shuttle
24:54 launch and then it was you know gets
24:57 safely into orbit and then nothing it
25:00 says this is a covert intelligence
25:02 satellite military satellite and the
25:04 feed goes dead and they deploy this
25:06 thing we don't see anything we don't see
25:08 the shuttle doors open we don't see that
25:10 Canadian arm grab it and put it out
25:11 there and then turn it on now I was told
25:14 again 30 years ago that there is no need
25:19 to have man escort a satellite into
25:22 space that is a fallacy you can launch
25:26 it into space on a rocket
25:28 especially in 2020 but now let's go back
25:34 to earth let's go to 1958 and for those
25:38 of you are heart fans har RP this is a
25:43 antenna technology that we use on earth
25:46 to beam powerful waves of electricity
25:50 towards the ionosphere bounce it off the
25:54 atmosphere and he comes back down
25:56 crashing on earth this particular
25:59 antenna this is not a conspiracy okay
26:03 this particular antenna was patented by
26:06 I believe his name is Bernard Easton if
26:09 it's not Easton's Eastman and he
26:14 patented it for earthquakes weather
26:18 manipulation and mind-control in
26:22 addition to a bunch of other benign crap
26:24 that we don't care about do you need any
26:27 more than those three things and it's
26:30 all based off Tesla's patents as well so
26:32 they stood on Tesla's shoulders and this
26:33 is literally being patented within 15
26:36 years of Tesla's death how ironic so how
26:41 do those three technologies work well
26:44 weather manipulation is actually
26:45 probably fairly interesting I think
26:48 creating a high-pressure system would be
26:49 the easiest thing which would erase
26:51 storms over a particular area which is
26:53 usually the giant threat high pressure
26:56 systems do what every time the
26:57 weatherman pointed at the H or the
27:00 on a weather pattern when you were a kid
27:03 high pressure means pushing down pushes
27:07 all the clouds out of the way and you
27:08 have arid desert conditions underneath
27:10 you have summer and Southern California
27:13 where it doesn't rain a lot that's why
27:15 they built Disneyland in Anaheim had
27:17 very low rain quota but of course now
27:21 it's climate change you know the the
27:22 [ __ ] we've known forever it's climate
27:24 change now a sudden great as far as
27:26 creating a low-pressure system not quite
27:29 sure how that would be the case maybe
27:30 how does or does not participate in low
27:32 pressure systems but that would
27:34 obviously be trying to create a system
27:36 where you're perhaps diverting low
27:39 pressure systems around by punching down
27:41 around it you know you create some high
27:42 pressure systems and it's just like you
27:44 know pushing something across the table
27:46 by pushing next to it you know
27:48 earthquakes well what's funny about it
27:53 is I will tell someone that factoid and
27:56 they will all gosh you know how could
27:58 that happened internet it's like hey the
28:00 patent was awarded for all three things
28:03 I don't know if you've ever filed a
28:05 patent in your life I've been involved
28:07 with patents since I was 18 years old
28:09 and you have to prove what you're
28:12 claiming otherwise you do not get the
28:14 patent patents are often abandoned so
28:18 you'll actually have someone say
28:20 so-and-so filed a patent for time travel
28:23 and they'll send you this hyperlink
28:25 straight into the Patent Office and it's
28:27 got all this crazy coast-to-coast stuff
28:29 on it but if you read the top part it
28:31 says patent abandoned which means you
28:34 can you can apply for any patent in the
28:37 planet if you can conceive of it and
28:38 write it down on paper you can send it
28:40 and spend your twenty four hundred bucks
28:41 and but you can't get it passed and so
28:44 it just sits there and dies I've been
28:47 involved with patents that died too so
28:50 when I tell you that there's a patent in
28:52 the Patent Office award 1996 applied for
28:54 1994 for the cure to AIDS and people
28:59 laugh it's like well he got it the dude
29:02 got the patent he they take your blood
29:04 out of your body through a transfusion
29:05 treat it with the silver cleanse the
29:08 silver out of your blood and reinjected
29:09 in your body and you don't have any more
29:11 mutations
29:12 they can just keep going until you don't
29:14 have any all right you can't get the
29:16 medical patent unless you can prove it
29:18 medically works
29:20 it's knock yourself out but the way that
29:23 it works for an earthquake is that you
29:25 create this extremely intense wave of
29:28 energy that is going to resonate a
29:30 tectonic plate obviously you're gonna go
29:34 where it's really volatile anyway so if
29:36 we had a plate that was really stressed
29:40 they just add more stress it's already
29:44 stressed and you might think well you
29:47 know you know an antenna from Alaska is
29:50 gonna make an earthquake underneath the
29:53 nuclear facility in Iran the day after
29:55 they kill Sumalee sulemani
29:57 yeah they just it's just like the wind
30:03 that made the bridges in the 1930s flop
30:06 around until they exploded
30:08 what if somebody said I'm gonna put so
30:09 much wind on that bridge it's gonna fall
30:11 apart most laymen like myself before you
30:15 see it we go no way man
30:17 you know it's a bridge do dat weighs
30:19 thousands of tons no weight and then you
30:22 watch it you're like oh my god and this
30:23 you know the architects go yeah it's at
30:26 the exact frequency of the bridges
30:30 tension and so just nudges it and nudges
30:33 it nudges it until the point it starts
30:34 to swing swing swing and it becomes this
30:36 a perpetual motor of death since the
30:42 actual schematics of HAARP have never
30:44 really been published for anyone to
30:45 analyze we're not sure how intense that
30:49 beam can be but if you look at the array
30:51 and read the basic physics of what they
30:53 say they do they roll this antenna in a
30:56 big circle circle circle until they
30:58 create a vortex and that vortex is an
31:00 exponential creation of power it's an
31:04 exponential routing of power so you're
31:06 at 1x when you first turn it on and then
31:09 who knows maybe it's 100 X thousand X a
31:11 million X by the time it shoots that
31:13 thing in the sky this is technology on
31:15 planet Earth
31:18 now let's go for mind-control unlike an
31:23 earthquake situation mind control is
31:27 probably phenomenally easier why because
31:32 the human mind operates on a fraction of
31:36 a fraction of a fraction of a volt of
31:39 electricity its amperage is nothing
31:43 and so it's wattage is nothing it needs
31:46 nothing to start to manipulate the
31:50 ability of the mind in a very obtuse way
31:53 to have a particular spectrum of motion
31:56 vailable to it it's probably obvious to
32:01 you that when you're calm your frequency
32:04 in your mind is very very long way if
32:07 it's very relaxed you know and then when
32:11 you are excited and terrified and in a
32:13 fit of our state of fight-or-flight it
32:16 is as tight of a wave as it could
32:19 possibly be and your synapse are working
32:21 overtime just like some you know
32:23 fictional sci-fi UFO engine that's just
32:26 about to explode and so that antenna
32:30 merely has to figure out a way to gently
32:34 put down a very minut amount of
32:36 electricity that will penetrate the
32:37 skull and create these obtuse feelings
32:41 now is that a huge threat making you
32:45 feel bad or making you feel good
32:46 obviously it is if someone could take it
32:51 to the next level and say look we have
32:53 figured out the state of mind that is
32:55 depression the state of mind that is
32:58 depression to a suicidal level and so if
33:01 we want to depopulate without getting
33:03 caught we merely beam onto a major city
33:05 like Tokyo New York LA this suicidal
33:09 wave and then we just watched the news
33:12 the next day yeah we won't learn about
33:15 young people and nobody's that you know
33:18 aren't famous like you and me but we
33:20 might find out that Robin Williams takes
33:22 himself out someone who's already on the
33:24 edge anyway and then and you know the
33:26 military profiling people they go hey
33:28 what's beautiful about it is most people
33:31 are
33:31 began to take their life have already
33:33 been on the very edge of doing it anyway
33:34 and so when they do take their life the
33:37 there's no conspiracy that pops up
33:39 because every family member can say yeah
33:42 you know they had attempted it before or
33:45 they were very depressed like Robin
33:46 Williams was suffering from dementia and
33:49 Alzheimer's one of the two he was
33:53 frustrated with his career so if he
33:55 finally gets pushed over the edge why
33:57 everyone's got a back story it just
34:00 flows like butter but this whole thing
34:03 with harp think about what it's really
34:06 doing it's pioneering electrical
34:09 technology that can be shot from the
34:12 earth off the ionosphere and back down
34:15 to earth but what if that's just a
34:18 prototyping mechanism before the
34:21 technology is then wrapped up inside of
34:23 satellite technology that is used in to
34:27 beam down to earth now do they have jets
34:31 that have all this technology in them I
34:33 think some where you need an infinite
34:35 power supply you need space you need the
34:39 Van Allen belts with infinite electron
34:42 clouds you can't handle the amount of
34:46 electrons that are out there man could
34:49 not build one machine that could take
34:50 any full blown cross-section of the Van
34:54 Allen belts and use all that power it
34:57 would vaporize whatever we would try to
34:59 metabolize is at least the current
35:00 technology that I am aware of what is
35:04 one of the greatest concerns of the
35:05 modern era well in America because we
35:11 don't have agenda 21 is something that
35:13 is anything other than a conspiracy but
35:15 the EU meets on it every 10 years and
35:17 has plenty of council meetings every day
35:19 on it
35:19 we just think surveillance surveillance
35:25 cameras everywhere our government has
35:28 broken our Fourth Amendment and the ease
35:30 drop and steal everything you know if
35:34 the NSA structure is correct then at
35:37 least they put it behind a closed door
35:38 no one can look at it unless you have a
35:40 FISA warrant to go and look at a
35:42 particular individual and you have to
35:43 prove your case but we just watch the
35:45 FBI the CIA the DOJ in the current you
35:50 know Obama administration with Secretary
35:52 Clinton fake purchase and fake a dossier
35:57 that could make anyone susceptible to a
36:00 fake investigation well it's a real
36:02 investigation using fake credentials so
36:05 the FISA Court has told the people we
36:07 are completely inept
36:08 and we can be duped easily in fact we
36:13 are so inept we don't even ask the most
36:15 basic questions is this source reliable
36:18 prove it had either one of those
36:21 questions been asked the president Trump
36:24 would have been spied on before he
36:25 became president okay now in the EU
36:31 countries where agenda 21 which was
36:34 launched in 1992 signed by a hundred and
36:37 fifty-nine countries and has been
36:40 aboveboard the entire time they are
36:43 getting rid of rural Europe pushing
36:46 everyone to major cities that are
36:48 concentration camps of surveillance and
36:52 again I tell you this 100 times
36:54 go watch thx 138 and pay attention to
36:58 the level of surveillance in that movie
37:00 George Lucas's first movie it was a
37:03 student film in college and he got
37:05 enough money to pop out and do it in
37:07 real life with Robert Duvall it's a
37:14 great movie
37:14 it's a great fascist crazy agenda21
37:18 world that's what thx 1-1 3-8
37:22 is it is the fully implemented agenda 21
37:26 the world is depopulated 99% and
37:29 whoever's left is inside of a horrible
37:32 tyrannical world you're you're governed
37:37 by a bunch of robots that look like bike
37:39 cops from chips from the late 70s you're
37:42 gonna new if you look at a California
37:44 bike cop but you turn the face into a
37:47 mannequin of chrome that's what the
37:51 robots look like well what's going on
37:53 with robots today Boston Dynamics anyone
37:57 who's a Toyota
37:59 and Sony and all these big players they
38:01 are not gonna miss out on the robot
38:03 Empire that's going to govern the people
38:06 sadly there's going to be probably a
38:09 margin in history where these robots are
38:11 gonna be used for war against people
38:12 that don't have them and that'll be a
38:14 wholesale slaughter of human beings but
38:16 we don't have the power supply's yet we
38:19 don't have the actual robot designs yet
38:21 to endure desert conditions and tropical
38:24 conditions but they're gonna get there
38:26 in 20 years time I'm willing to bet we
38:29 could have a special robot that's a sand
38:32 robot that just no matter how much it
38:34 rolls around in the sand
38:36 nothing gets jammed up the power
38:38 supplies will be mysterious to us but
38:40 they will be zero-point energy systems
38:42 that will function forever
38:44 it'll be like iron man's little chess
38:46 piece and once you have infinite energy
38:49 you just think about it the Iron Man
38:51 suit becomes plausible all of a sudden
38:54 what sort of energy comes out of his
38:56 palm what looks like to me the fictional
38:59 reality of that sorry there the real
39:02 reality of that fictional suit would be
39:03 a plasma beam Wow what could possibly
39:07 endure a plasma strike not a whole hell
39:11 of a lot you could have depleted uranium
39:14 tanks and this stuff will go right
39:15 through it like butter
39:17 okay so Americans have a bit of a hubris
39:23 about our constitution about our
39:26 willingness to defend ourselves mm-hmm
39:30 yeah we are definitely that breed that
39:34 we'll fight and I think there's plenty
39:35 of countries that will do that and
39:36 there's plenty of people in all
39:37 countries that will do that we're a
39:39 whole country of that feeling we don't
39:42 cower down usually to our rulers and in
39:46 great numbers which is why we probably
39:48 have nearly a billion guns and
39:50 households all across our country but
39:54 now think of I I'm gonna give you a
39:57 scenario you're gonna have someone like
40:00 me who completely believes the
40:01 satellite's exists with whatever
40:03 technology and whatever reality is out
40:05 there they're able to six stick
40:07 something in space and keep it there for
40:09 long enough to cause me some huge
40:11 problem
40:11 but then we'll have a whole nother group
40:13 of folks that have indoctrinated
40:15 themselves away from satellites
40:18 unnecessarily so to prove a point about
40:21 the shape of the earth again one does
40:23 not negate the other on in any
40:25 circumstance the moon and the Sun are
40:28 satellites so it's probably not so smart
40:31 to say satellites don't exist as some
40:33 ala carte epiphany as a result of
40:37 believing the earth is a flat disc
40:40 ironically this little patio table I
40:43 used to hold my new mite unit is a round
40:45 disc with a nice black edge on it but
40:49 let's just say the EU doesn't die the
40:52 people of Europe continue to cower down
40:55 to this Hitler's daughter Merkel and it
40:59 just gets more and more powerful thank
41:02 God
41:02 Rex it's about to happen we need know
41:07 what you call Deutsch get annoyed exit
41:09 no we need France exit we need Italy
41:12 exit we need a mall to get out of this
41:13 thing you know we need to have those
41:15 people in a Nuremberg trial let me just
41:19 tell you you've really got to start
41:22 moving man rosa quarry will tell you all
41:25 about it in 221 just look her up her
41:27 last name starts with the K if you just
41:30 look up agenda 21 Rosa ro sa you're
41:32 gonna find all her stuff don't just
41:34 watch one watch like ten yes you're
41:37 gonna have to have about twelve hours to
41:39 do it but you will become so immediately
41:41 informed with that you're at home
41:43 probably for the first time in your
41:45 awakened Asst go back into a state of
41:47 fear for at least a few days as you
41:49 started to mulch this stuff but I'm
41:52 gonna give you a Red Dawn scenario with
41:55 the end of America why do Americans feel
41:59 safe well we have a second amendment to
42:03 protect all the other amendments okay
42:07 and let's say that whatever reason all
42:12 the good presidents are gone they throw
42:15 the votes nobody fights back nobody
42:19 hangs anybody for you know submitting
42:22 fake votes their voting machine allowing
42:23 illegal immigrants
42:24 vote and so we lose technically our
42:30 Second Amendment but a bunch of people
42:34 then buy guns off the black market
42:37 and they keep them hidden now this works
42:40 both ways even if we don't lose our
42:42 Second Amendment the scenario I'm about
42:43 to give you is bad there are ways to get
42:48 around it but I don't think too many
42:50 people think about this and there are
42:53 things that they can do to make it 100%
42:59 effective for their plan so they tried
43:02 to seize this country hey Obama was just
43:06 about to sell the whole place out if we
43:09 were to have like for Obama's in a row
43:11 then you wouldn't have America anymore
43:13 at all everything would be illegal that
43:15 was the Constitution freedom of speech
43:17 gone second amendment gone you think 4th
43:21 amendments been violated to this point
43:23 it would be beyond gone your due process
43:27 and your speedy trial gone this crazy
43:30 impeachment they put on Trump for no
43:31 crimes that'll become you and while you
43:34 looked and said I hate Trump I hate
43:36 Trump he's a dick okay then that's the
43:39 trial you get you get no attorney no
43:41 representation there's no discovery
43:43 meaning your side gets the same
43:44 information they have and they put you
43:46 in jail for no crimes because that's
43:48 what you allowed to happen to Trump
43:49 this is why I can't happen again it's a
43:53 bad thing it's an IQ test if you for the
43:55 impeachment you're failing the test
43:59 because if it ever happened to you you
44:01 would cry foul in a second all right
44:05 you're in your house there's going to be
44:08 two scenarios there's going to be the
44:09 urban scenario and there'll be the rural
44:12 American scenario now a takeover is not
44:16 going to occur in Kansas at least in the
44:19 country it won't happen in Montana
44:22 it won't happen in most of Texas where
44:24 no one lives next to a city okay so the
44:29 cities go first there'll be these robot
44:34 troops
44:35 but have little blue helmet paint jobs
44:38 little chappies it's all you stuff you
44:42 win stuff maybe they come up with a
44:44 third brand it's just like the new
44:46 America me and their margin down the
44:48 street all these robots do well
44:51 everyone's afraid of all this SuperDuper
44:53 AI lowbrow AI is taking care of the game
44:56 they've been outfitted with thermal
44:59 sensors that can read through walls
45:01 they've had that for 40 years they have
45:04 infinite rounds on them I mean if it's
45:06 plasma based rounds it's like a laser
45:09 rifle which which has no ammo but let's
45:12 just say it did have some ammo
45:13 it's got the five five six to go really
45:15 deep maybe even has a twenty cow can and
45:19 on it depending on what's there and
45:20 maybe they're all in a big formation so
45:22 if there's someone behind a bunch of
45:24 barriers but they can sense it's there
45:25 they bring out the huge 20 Cal tanks
45:27 that just blow right through the walls
45:28 everyone else it's a little nine
45:30 millimeter here and 40 Cal there may be
45:34 some 308 and they're just cleaning out
45:37 an area there there's a there's a ford
45:40 group that just announces its you have
45:43 to leave you have to leave and they wait
45:45 in for anyone who holds out and like
45:47 Anne Frank in a in a attic or a basement
45:50 or behind some fortified safe room their
45:54 second wave is gonna take care of them
45:55 and so there's physical extraction of
45:59 areas so that they can be completely
46:01 dominated and turn into an agenda 21
46:03 concentration camp where surveillance is
46:05 everywhere and no one is ever free again
46:08 ever
46:10 alright their game would be to probably
46:14 in certain areas level the whole place
46:17 flat because they don't want to keep the
46:18 ghettos they don't want to keep those
46:20 buildings they're not good for
46:21 surveillance they're not good for
46:22 reconstruction I mean they can't go in
46:24 and just install cameras and it's all
46:25 gonna be okay
46:26 some buildings are gonna be fine I can
46:28 be be a projects building it's just fine
46:30 this is as long as it's structurally
46:32 good they can always go in and put all
46:33 the cameras in there you know you toy
46:35 with the camera it's probably death
46:37 sentence after that point so this fleet
46:40 of robots can go in and clean everything
46:42 out according to some Geneva thing it's
46:46 for the greater good is what they're
46:47 gonna tell everybody
46:48 and of course all the meek will tell on
46:50 their neighbors so that's gonna help out
46:52 as well all right now once you get
46:56 captured because you're gonna be pulled
46:59 out of your house
47:00 we have over 1200 FEMA camps in the
47:03 United States of America as they
47:04 currently exist today and that fact that
47:06 that statistic is 10 years old
47:07 I want to hear that our president's
47:10 shutting those things down bulldozing
47:11 them down they no longer get to be
47:14 called that now something my camps are
47:16 really beautiful you know almost used
47:18 exclusively for filtering immigration
47:20 with violators but a lot of them are
47:23 like Korean death camps I mean it's
47:25 crazy they're not even as nice as
47:29 Auschwitz okay and so you'll be
47:31 evaluated as an individual who are you
47:34 we've got a big AI database on who you
47:37 are every single thing you've ever said
47:39 on a telephone call email social media
47:41 etc in earshot of any camera or whatever
47:45 where your face was identified saying a
47:48 certain thing we're going to major level
47:50 of dissidents dissonance and descent
47:53 Minh against the government and you're
47:55 going to be probably executed
47:57 immediately if you are a really volatile
47:59 person there might be as rumored a
48:02 b-line the a line is immediate death be
48:06 line is see if you can see if you really
48:09 meant what you said or something some
48:11 rehabilitation last-minute thing do you
48:13 have probably a 70% chance of being
48:15 assassinated and then C&D just keep
48:17 diminishing to the point where the D is
48:19 for docile and you just sit and starve
48:23 in this place until they tell you where
48:25 you can go and you want to feel so lucky
48:27 if you're in the D I didn't get killed I
48:30 must have done something right yeah you
48:32 sold out everybody that's why you're in
48:35 D you're the dunce you're the degenerate
48:38 who sold out your entire species so be
48:42 in the a is my recommendation if you
48:47 don't stand for anything then you stand
48:49 for nothing so let's say that there's
48:52 areas where these robots are very very
48:54 effective according to their current
48:55 design
48:57 but now let's go out to the rural areas
49:00 because that represents at least 50% of
49:03 the United States population hmm are
49:06 they really gonna make robots go all
49:08 over the countryside seems sort of
49:11 inefficient doesn't it ah that's where
49:16 satellites become phenomenal it also
49:18 lends itself to cargo jets with the same
49:22 equipment on them another very
49:24 specialized aircraft that have the same
49:26 systems on them again those same
49:29 directed-energy weapon planes that are
49:30 used to start fires all over the planet
49:33 you know they don't have a lot of cargo
49:35 space in and before they get the job
49:36 done don't think so what are some common
49:39 denominators of weaponry
49:42 well there's the gun itself which
49:45 usually today it's a bit of ceramic and
49:47 it's a bit of steel usually the pin is
49:51 always steel so even if you create a
49:54 fully ceramic gun you 3d print a gun
49:57 even the hammer inside the pin mechanism
50:01 there's all ceramic and it works well
50:05 what are you firing you're firing
50:07 bullets
50:09 well bullets can be made of all kinds of
50:11 different stuff but it's all metal
50:14 typically now you could potentially I
50:16 don't know how you do a bullet that's
50:18 completely ceramic maybe you can I have
50:21 not studied whether or not the ceramic
50:23 guns do bullets that aren't made of
50:26 steel okay what did we talk about
50:29 earlier directed-energy weapons they
50:33 exist for sure they've been admitted to
50:35 exist I've got one friend of mine that
50:38 created a tiny one in his factory floor
50:41 and he was vaporizing paperclips
50:45 which is like pot steel not so hard but
50:50 now with a satellite different than a
50:54 plane the amount of energy you have
50:57 available is phenomenal
51:00 so you take little country towns in
51:02 rural areas
51:03 and you zap them you zap them for copper
51:09 lead
51:10 steel aluminum maybe titanium everything
51:15 in the spectrum that could be used to
51:17 construct a gun and to construct
51:19 ammunition now your Second Amendment
51:24 doesn't exist anymore
51:26 maybe even your house starts to fall
51:28 apart because all the nails start to get
51:30 blown up they don't give a [ __ ] this is
51:32 the takeover baby and so your car falls
51:36 apart out front but maybe the system has
51:39 a little bit of artificial intelligence
51:40 and sees warm bodies and maybe it tries
51:44 not to hit a body won't hurt you there's
51:46 from what we understand unless you're
51:48 holding on to something and it turns
51:49 into like a 2500 degree piece of steel
51:53 or hotter Celsius probably so very
51:58 quickly everything that you would use to
52:01 fight back is gone in fact your
52:02 technology to communicate with the
52:03 outside world disappears because your
52:06 cell phone's gonna basically be e impede
52:08 by this technology your radios will be e
52:11 impede your television will be impede
52:13 everything that creates communication
52:15 with the outside world is gone and so
52:17 your world goes dark if you don't get
52:19 killed in the process it's probably
52:22 gonna create fires as well if your house
52:24 isn't collapse on top of your head it
52:27 was a good time to build everything out
52:28 of bricks again and concrete but I'm
52:32 getting ahead of the plan because I
52:33 think the plan would involve a lot more
52:35 strategic okay remember we talked about
52:39 mind control hmm I don't think they want
52:43 to create too many earthquakes because
52:44 that disturbs the soil and their ability
52:47 to develop these urban concentration
52:50 camps they don't want the world all
52:53 messed up on the ground that'd be a
52:55 last-ditch thing and I don't think they
52:57 would do it but so you have a fairly
53:01 maybe have 800 people in a little town
53:03 called Fair Kansas hate to pick on therr
53:08 but there you go
53:09 great steaks in there let me tell you
53:10 it's on the 169 south of chanute just to
53:15 ask where they serve steaks and just say
53:16 okay point me there but remember the
53:19 mind control thing what is the very
53:22 first thing they do is put
53:24 to sleep or make you feel very afraid or
53:29 maybe make you feel really docile you're
53:31 just sitting there going hey mrs. cool
53:33 do
53:33 hey the TV went out oh man that's groovy
53:36 dude
53:37 so whatever algorithm they think is
53:39 going to be most fortuitous to their
53:42 next phase which is to zap everything
53:44 that could possibly be a weapon in your
53:46 house including the house itself maybe
53:49 just turns into a bunch of fire just
53:51 like paradise maybe they even have the
53:54 wherewithal to say we're gonna being
53:56 down a message it says you better leave
53:58 your house because it's about to be on
54:01 fire you're only getting it one morning
54:04 maybe everything takes effort and energy
54:07 so don't be surprised if there's no
54:09 warning alright so we should assume that
54:15 an overwhelming majority a 95 to 99% of
54:20 people in the world hiding in their
54:22 homes or being in their homes would be
54:24 effectively destroyed by this these two
54:26 pieces of technology and believe me it's
54:30 not going to be Search and Destroy they
54:32 will have already searched for you found
54:33 where you are and cest everything for
54:35 probably a decade before this kind of
54:37 thing would ever occur there's no place
54:39 to hide man but let's just say for
54:43 whatever reason there's an area that's
54:44 causing them problems
54:46 maybe there's a derelict facility made
54:50 of cement and a lot of people are hiding
54:52 in that facility
54:54 maybe you're smart enough and rich
54:56 enough to dig a huge bunker maybe or you
55:00 can pawn it off as a tornado shelter or
55:02 whatever it's it's like 3040 feet
55:06 underground it's really reinforced with
55:08 two or three to ten feet of cement
55:10 cement it's pretty cheap you just do it
55:12 now they can't really see you anymore
55:14 but they know you're there because they
55:15 can see this lump in the ground that
55:17 reports back a structure hmm satellite
55:22 technology well maybe not I use
55:24 satellite technology for that sort of
55:26 thing we have bunker busters falling out
55:28 of our asses so it goes over the radio
55:33 got one drones come by with
55:37 these heavy bunker busters they don't
55:39 need to be delivered by human beings but
55:41 I'm sure they could find a bunch of
55:42 folks that are completely loyal to a
55:44 fake story to create this third face
55:48 mind-control guns being melted house set
55:51 on fire is really all one shot and then
55:54 the third phase would be anyone that has
55:56 a problem being told what to do
56:00 could be bunker buster out of existence
56:03 doesn't matter four guys running down
56:05 the street with his you knows m1 rifle
56:08 that just gonna vaporize in his hands
56:10 knock yourself out - we don't need to
56:12 worry about that dude if they cut off
56:15 all the food supply and electricity from
56:17 the area this is shut off this
56:19 electricity to the area that's already a
56:20 bad news situation but some guys like
56:23 Ted Nugent know how to hunt and clean
56:25 and eat but you're reduced to the stone
56:29 Age's overnight because all modern
56:32 technology has been fried
56:33 man you got a car who cares you got a
56:36 bicycle it's gone
56:38 unless you're made out of wood you got
56:40 damn near nothing you probably don't
56:42 even have the wheel maybe get it old
56:46 what the Amish should do pretty good
56:48 right Amish just like oh the phone
56:50 doesn't work okay that one phone call we
56:51 make a month with the approval from the
56:54 High Council doesn't happen okay you see
56:57 how easy it is you know you may say well
57:00 that's not easy well you're right but
57:04 you don't know how many decades they've
57:05 been planning for something like this
57:07 this is why I don't want you to pan and
57:10 pawn off the existence of satellites
57:14 it's already bad enough that we allow
57:18 our government for the sake of national
57:20 security to have a bunch of technology
57:22 that we are unaware of and there's two
57:25 sides to the technology that we're
57:27 unaware of there is technology that we
57:30 aren't aware of that we could prophesize
57:31 to say look we know that they have say
57:34 rail guns rail guns that can shoot
57:38 ceramic projectiles so damn quick to
57:41 turn a building inside out a second
57:43 there's this mezzanine where you and I
57:46 can conceive of it but the average
57:48 population can't conceive it and that's
57:49 mind control
57:51 one of the greatest little rabbit holes
57:54 you can go down is to go into YouTube
57:56 and search on CIA mind control and
57:59 listen to every single episode that you
58:01 can find and one of them is gonna be a
58:03 guy in the mid 90s who said well I guess
58:06 it's in the mid nineties if nothing else
58:08 he's referring to the mid 90s and he
58:09 said by the mid 90s we had it completely
58:11 under control we can control anyone's
58:15 mind now luckily the brain is a
58:18 three-dimensional object inside of our
58:21 heads and the neural patterns that need
58:24 to exist within the brain to create any
58:25 one emotion are a three-dimensional
58:28 pattern of electricity being configured
58:32 in our mind and so an obtuse way from
58:35 the outside most likely can't organize
58:40 all the electrons inside your mind in a
58:41 three-dimensional way from space and it
58:44 probably never will be that amazing so
58:48 in order to make you think about you
58:50 know a quote out of a movie it's
58:53 probably really tough but again overall
58:56 fear overall docile nature probably not
58:59 so hard now there are also very simple
59:04 ways when I teach my students neurology
59:06 as it relates to the experiencing of
59:09 fictional things like screenplays and
59:12 video games I always give them a little
59:16 experiment where I'll clap my hand
59:18 together clap my hands together and one
59:21 little clamp you know so I smack him
59:23 again I say look you know I tell them
59:24 what's gonna happen so I don't know
59:25 those Dickie teachers but I just say I
59:27 want you to feel your heart when this
59:29 happens feel the way your brain feels
59:32 feel how your blood stream just you know
59:34 got a little bit higher in pressure
59:36 those of you who like the sound of my
59:39 voice and you see you go to sleep to
59:40 this because I'm a very relaxed guy and
59:42 my voice reflects that so transferring
59:45 through this microphone onto the the
59:48 flash card into my computer edit it all
59:50 up made nice and sexy by the 58 mic it
59:55 puts you to sleep oh that's just an
59:59 obtuse technique am i controlling
60:02 exactly what you think about only
60:04 because I'm making
60:06 but I guarantee if I hum did the ohm if
60:10 you do the same thing that relax you but
60:13 if I started playing you know bring the
60:16 noise by anthrax and you know Public
60:18 Enemy all the sudden in the middle of
60:20 this video
60:23 your blood rate would go up you'd wake
60:24 up and you'd be like what are you doing
60:26 you're hurt you're hurting my feelings
60:27 they're hurting my brain the sycophant
60:32 systemic quality of a military like
60:37 military industrial complex and agencies
60:41 above those agencies is that they go in
60:47 all directions possible ii they discover
60:50 a paradigm of thought a paradigm of
60:52 science they will go in the dark and
60:55 they will go in the light think about
60:58 all these viral centers where they
61:01 create these horrible you know protein
61:04 viruses and normal viruses that kill
61:06 human beings all these biological
61:08 weapons we're constantly developing
61:10 biological weapons one we create you
61:15 know the the big CDC hoorah CDC worship
61:19 stories like walkie dead is the boa the
61:21 CDC is always on your side
61:23 it's an appointed body by a bunch of
61:25 shills full of a bunch of shales and you
61:28 know there's good people there's bad
61:29 people but if we're gonna outlaw nuclear
61:33 weapons or limit the amount of nuclear
61:35 weapons in the world we should have
61:37 outlawed research into these areas but
61:39 the government knows that humans are
61:41 humans we outlawed in the United States
61:44 and we cease creating these viruses and
61:47 their antidotes and then China will do
61:50 it or Russia will do it or someone else
61:52 will do it I don't mean to blame anyone
61:54 in particular but it's like they'll
61:55 continue doing it and then they have the
61:57 upper hand on us the second they drop
61:59 something in our water supply and you
62:02 know you can genetically modify
62:04 something to to say Asians don't get
62:07 killed by this Russians don't get killed
62:08 by this because there's one little thing
62:10 in our in their protein patterns or
62:12 whatever that we don't have is everyone
62:13 else in the world and everyone else dies
62:15 they just take the world
62:18 America's doing it probably more
62:20 intensely than everyone else so I don't
62:21 mean to put anything on anyone's back
62:23 but then there is that realm that's hard
62:28 to talk about because there are most
62:30 likely technologies that we can't
62:31 conceive of probably not that many and
62:35 maybe not for the deep thoughts crowd
62:38 you know time travel has been
62:40 romanticized because of this
62:41 misinterpretation of a cue post this
62:45 project Looking Glass thing but boy
62:48 isn't it amazing how many people jump on
62:49 the project Looking Glass project
62:51 without knowing the first thing about
62:52 time travel these geniuses they'll say
62:56 man brothers look grass first thing you
62:58 know about time travel is not linear
63:00 okay genius if it's not linear then you
63:03 have nothing to [ __ ] worry about and
63:05 you know why because all the realities
63:06 that you're modifying are not ours so
63:09 [ __ ] knock yourself out there buddy
63:11 Walter Bishop
63:13 you're not gonna affect our world and I
63:17 think it's funny that a lot of the
63:19 fictional shows out there will because
63:22 again I totally support this in terms of
63:26 a fictional television show or movie
63:28 because you just got to do what you got
63:29 to do to make something have a little
63:31 bit of cohesion but oftentimes these
63:36 time multi-dimensional time episodes or
63:40 whatever shows they usually get up to
63:43 two universes and that's it is our
63:45 universe in a parallel universe and the
63:47 parallel universe is hysterically funny
63:49 from a scientific standpoint because the
63:52 second that you can conceive of a
63:54 parallel universe you must conceive of
63:56 infinite parallel universes you have to
63:58 and the idea that you would have a beef
64:00 with just one parallel universe if you
64:03 create some ripple and time some anomaly
64:06 in the fabric of the universes or
64:08 whatever you'd have a problem across the
64:09 board not just in this other one right
64:14 but again if someone tells you that they
64:17 the time ain't linear and that they
64:20 transferred to you know Gettysburg
64:23 Address and they got their photograph
64:25 taken I mean like where are these people
64:27 committing genius man in terms of
64:29 entertainment and the
64:31 sort of Ripley's Believe It or Not it's
64:34 it's a great story it's a great story
64:36 but if it's not linear then you left our
64:40 universe went and visited this
64:42 Gettysburg Address had your photograph
64:44 taken in that universe and then you came
64:45 back to this universe and the photo
64:47 doesn't exist because you didn't do it
64:49 here
64:50 the only sexy time-travel paradigm that
64:56 is sexy and has threats to our existence
64:59 and predicting the future and all this
65:01 other crap would be linear time there's
65:04 one time one dimension of existence and
65:07 all you're doing is going back and forth
65:08 which means right now me sitting back
65:10 here on my patio someone should show up
65:13 you know let's say my episodes go
65:16 thousand years in the future which they
65:18 won't but let's just say they did and
65:20 someone's like oh my god we found your
65:21 show and you write about a bunch of
65:23 stuff and you're wrong about a bunch of
65:24 stuff so we wanted to meet you in fact
65:26 we just wanted to watch you do the show
65:28 they come back here pull up a seat do it
65:31 to it right not happening for all this
65:34 time try when I digressed a little bit
65:36 here but it's kind of fun extra thinking
65:38 to dismiss things so that we can focus
65:41 okay is it again if they had time travel
65:45 in a linear way they'd be or even an
65:47 even in a multi-dimensional way they'd
65:49 be able to look ahead and go okay we're
65:50 gonna blow up these two buildings in New
65:51 York and knock this other one down and
65:53 there weren't also their stuff on
65:55 September 11th 2001 let's see all the
66:00 problems that we've had and then they
66:02 just Groundhog Day the [ __ ] out of this
66:04 thing until we get it completely right
66:05 just like Bill Murray and Groundhog Day
66:08 eventually got the day or you look at
66:10 Tom Cruise and edge of tomorrow where he
66:12 constantly has to get to this battle
66:14 over and over and over and over again it
66:16 finally just gets it so right it's a
66:18 clockwork turn left turn right and even
66:20 if something spirals out of his script
66:23 he's so good as a soldier he just kicks
66:24 their ass right not happening our
66:27 universe is it man we catch them the
66:29 second they pull one of these ffs right
66:32 so part of this this sort of and this
66:37 will you know I don't think yet this is
66:38 gonna what I'm about to suggest isn't
66:40 gonna happen anytime soon but
66:43 it is good to remember the coo of Russia
66:46 I don't think a cool of Russia is gonna
66:49 happen in the near future at the level
66:52 that they were able to get and I
66:53 remember watching videos back in the
66:55 early 90s when this thing was going down
66:57 they showed the citizens of Russia
66:58 raiding KGB facilities and because they
67:04 didn't have computerized databases for
67:06 everything there were these the one
67:09 video I saw I still can't scrub it out
67:10 of my mind were these sort of it's one
67:14 of those walls with the little tiny
67:16 cards inside the pullout drawers you see
67:18 him in old movies really applaud this
67:20 drawer it's like three feet out it's got
67:21 little tiny cards in it like index cards
67:23 and they had alphabetized on this one
67:27 wall at least this is what the narration
67:30 said in the video that these individuals
67:32 have lost their relatives a long time
67:34 ago the UK got captured by the
67:35 government they simply disappeared they
67:37 want to know where the hell their
67:38 relatives went in this wall for this
67:42 particular region of Russia had all that
67:44 information say looking at the relatives
67:46 and finding out beyond this gate was
67:47 murder this guy was sent away does a
67:49 soldier and then murdered I mean it was
67:51 like it was a horrific but but
67:56 satisfying situation so these
67:57 individuals who could get closure for
67:59 the very first time
68:00 it's sad that that had to be that way
68:05 right that these individuals had to rush
68:07 a building and do all that stuff because
68:09 obviously it was a very unique moment in
68:12 time where no one was getting paid in
68:15 them in the military or the government
68:16 so they were like yeah go and raid this
68:18 joint I don't care I haven't seen a
68:20 paycheck in six months I don't see that
68:23 happening in the current time especially
68:25 with a booming economy for the United
68:29 States of America and again I you know
68:31 it's it's strange you know I obviously
68:33 am a very patriotic person and I do
68:35 trust that 99.999% of people in this
68:40 country want nothing bad to happen to
68:42 anyone else not only here but in every
68:45 other country right we're indoctrinated
68:48 here and there but I don't like the idea
68:50 that there's a world where death
68:56 is coveted meaning the mechanism by
69:00 which to take a life with weaponry
69:02 because they always sell it to you is no
69:05 no this is not for United States
69:06 citizens this is for anyone who tries to
69:08 go up against us which I guess in most
69:10 cases is always the case but the problem
69:14 is is if we don't fortify our voting
69:16 system our citizenship especially our
69:20 citizenship as it relates to voting and
69:22 if we don't lock down voting as an
69:24 open-source program in every single
69:26 voting machine and lock down the ability
69:28 for voter fraud if we don't literally
69:30 hang by a rope in public everyone that
69:36 violates a voting that's what needs to
69:38 happen it needs to be a public
69:39 exhibition break their [ __ ] necks in
69:42 public so that anyone else considering
69:45 throwing the vote no you don't get a
69:47 lethal injection
69:49 you get stripped down to your skivvies
69:51 and you get hung in some public place it
69:54 needs to be horrific
69:55 because your name will go down the tubes
69:57 as well your whole family will go to
69:59 your mom's the one that stole all the
70:00 votes yeah your dad's the one yeah no I
70:03 don't have anything to do with you
70:04 you got scumbag genes [ __ ] off man
70:07 that's what needs to happen to people
70:09 who steal votes and the reason why I'm
70:11 making such an emphasis on this is that
70:13 that's how the government gets taken
70:14 over how in 2000 America is the most
70:19 amazing place on planet earth and by in
70:22 September 12th it sucks it just got
70:28 worse and worse and worse right we get
70:30 [ __ ] groped at airports you know
70:33 there's all kinds of like DUI
70:34 checkpoints now which is the most
70:36 Gestapo [ __ ] thing you've ever seen
70:38 your life right spare me you know the
70:42 [ __ ] uptick of that [ __ ] go in
70:45 front of [ __ ] bars if you want to
70:46 catch people being drunk you know
70:49 because of a few bad apples we're all
70:52 showing our papers and if we don't want
70:54 to show papers then you get this good
70:56 person who turns into a [ __ ] Nazi get
70:59 out of your car above us I know I'm a
71:01 free [ __ ] citizen man I'm not
71:03 drinking I don't even [ __ ] drink that
71:05 [ __ ] on my breath is called a cigar man
71:08 you know and luckily in Huntington Beach
71:10 that [ __ ] calmed down because we used to
71:12 have them every [ __ ] day every
71:14 weekend every Friday and Saturday on
71:15 Beach Boulevard our main drag here
71:17 they'd line up in front of a an Internet
71:22 burger I would hate to be the business
71:23 I'd sue the guy sue the [ __ ] City and
71:25 go look no one's coming into my
71:27 restaurant because you've lined up this
71:29 DUI checkpoint they don't want to go
71:32 through it they don't want anything else
71:35 discovered in their car that might be
71:37 today's most popular reason to throw you
71:39 in jail thing but if we don't protect
71:41 their vote and protect our country
71:43 which is what everyone swears to do when
71:45 they become a police officer a military
71:46 person and all those people 99.99% of
71:50 them would die for that cause protecting
71:55 our vote then we can get a shill for the
71:58 Bilderberg Group from the EU and all of
72:03 a sudden this impossible scenario I
72:05 outlined in this video
72:07 suddenly becomes a win not an if now
72:13 what blows me away okay is the situation
72:18 where and again you know your listeners
72:21 who live in Europe you're my heroes
72:23 because you guys are awake and you're
72:25 fighting for it and again Britain I
72:26 couldn't I couldn't had everybody on the
72:29 back who who wants to get out of the EU
72:31 I mean you'll find in history this was
72:34 the most amazing decision that Britain
72:38 made I want them to let go of Ireland if
72:41 they want to be like i'ma let go of
72:43 Scotland if they want to let go you know
72:44 the vote needs to be protected right
72:46 because most people in Scotland believe
72:49 that they actually voted themselves out
72:50 of you're out of England control British
72:54 control and it didn't happen like nope
72:57 we just gave you the vote because we
72:58 didn't think you'd win but you won so
72:59 now we have different thoughts so you
73:01 can't get out but whatever but the
73:04 European Union is essentially the the
73:09 paint job on the car that is the agenda
73:11 21
73:13 this satellite thing will be a mechanism
73:16 if it hasn't already occurred to put a
73:20 bunch of stuff into space to control
73:23 everyone down below what's one of the
73:25 most popular industries right now SpaceX
73:28 stuff all right now you can't blame
73:32 SpaceX employees necessarily except for
73:35 maybe some of the fake [ __ ] they're
73:36 doing but you know in the end it's like
73:38 well we're putting up a payload if they
73:42 have told us where that needs to be
73:43 their payload has to do whatever it
73:45 needs to do we're not on the hook for
73:47 that and we can't simply go well what is
73:50 it what are you putting in this payload
73:51 you know what does it do you know and
73:53 they get it all into the private
73:54 business so that old thing maybe that's
73:56 a new standard we put up there obviously
73:58 SpaceX would not be able to put up an
74:01 enemy satellite that would be something
74:03 they have to regulate I'm sure our
74:04 covert people checking all that stuff
74:06 out constantly but this is something
74:09 that the people are not paying attention
74:12 to because most people can't conceive of
74:14 it just satellite technology in general
74:16 and there's plenty of people I know the
74:19 bunch of you know the quotes from a
74:20 bunch of famous people and von Braun
74:23 talked about this supposedly with his
74:25 assistant who believe she has her own
74:28 PhD dominating space is gonna be a huge
74:31 thing woody von Braun also talked about
74:34 I didn't know this I didn't remember
74:38 this and maybe I think the interview
74:40 that I saw a long time ago may have been
74:41 abbreviated inside of maybe a journalism
74:44 video or something but he really talked
74:46 about too cataclysmic false flags that
74:51 they were going to engineer in his
74:53 opinion and he seemed to I mean if this
74:57 woman's telling the truth by god she
74:59 better be telling the truth because
75:01 she's creating a stereo she's not but
75:03 you know the one that we all know about
75:05 is the fake alien invasion which is a
75:07 huge endeavor and go see my episode on
75:10 that exact subject different interest to
75:12 just go to deep thoughts read accom look
75:14 or in this channel on youtube and search
75:16 the word invasion and you'll see it
75:18 that's a big one that's that's ships
75:21 that's having to create some sort of
75:23 alien being that is capable of
75:25 communicating and thinking
75:26 has an agenda I mean it would be really
75:29 just level 15 [ __ ] right on a scale of
75:31 one to ten but the other one was a
75:34 meteor shower cataclysmic event now some
75:41 of you remember the meteor that flew
75:44 over Russia and exploded and blew up all
75:46 the windows I think it's interesting
75:49 that the Russian military czar guy came
75:52 out and said yeah this was a weapon from
75:54 the CIA just to show us what they could
75:56 do this is during Obama's administration
75:57 now we know there's Baghdad Bob's all
76:01 over the place that will lie about all
76:03 kinds of stuff so who knows if that dude
76:05 knew what he was talking about
76:06 intentionally lied to create propaganda
76:08 or whatever but it certainly coincides
76:11 with an interview that happened decades
76:13 before that if n occurred which is von
76:16 Braun's secretaries saying there was
76:17 going to be technology that would create
76:19 the illusion in space or not you know
76:22 our skies that would look like asteroids
76:25 falling out of space and some oopsy it's
76:30 a real big meteor shower I just watched
76:34 the it's a it's one of the Marvel
76:37 Avengers movies that I had never seen
76:38 and it's the one where they invent the
76:42 character vision and it's the one where
76:45 the other robot oh my god Ultron or
76:52 something like that
76:52 this robot lifted a city out of the
76:55 ground and his whole plan was to slam it
76:59 back to the earth so fast that it would
77:02 create sort of an earth killing
77:04 situation now I have tried to think
77:08 about in my mind how that technology
77:12 would work forgetting the Marvel movie
77:14 for a second but you know how do you you
77:17 don't launch something into space and
77:19 then hurl it into the atmosphere in a
77:24 way that it behaves like a meteorite and
77:26 then would have any level of impact when
77:28 it hit because let's face it we have a
77:31 finite amount of equipment we can
77:32 actually put up with one shot and even
77:35 if you attach it to itself you know like
77:38 you'll see you put four or five things
77:40 together
77:40 one big thing and then you put a rocket
77:43 on the back and or you do something to
77:46 deteriorate its orbit and here it comes
77:47 back to the earth you know the
77:52 atmosphere is very powerful which we saw
77:54 when the the discovery satellite
77:59 discovery excuse me Space Shuttle came
78:02 back at reentry and burned up didn't
78:04 hurt the earth at all it's a pretty big
78:07 ship when you hear about the fictitious
78:09 story that of the volcanic explosion in
78:13 Arizona which they try to say is a
78:15 meteorite which it wasn't they tell you
78:18 that it was a meteorite about the size
78:20 of a bus that hit the earth again fully
78:23 perpendicular to the Earth's surface as
78:25 all fabled meteorites work never a
78:28 Superman crater where it slides across
78:30 the earth and creates an elliptical
78:31 shape on the ground net or even a you
78:35 know a chasm as it hit the ground and
78:37 created none of that all the moon's
78:39 craters are perfectly circular which
78:42 should tell you something about what
78:43 it's not they're not meteorites they're
78:49 not craters for meteorites the craters
78:51 from volcanic eruptions of a used to be
78:55 really active interior and again I love
78:58 I just would tell you you know if you if
79:00 you take this whole thing with the sort
79:04 of Plato's time before the moon and then
79:09 you take the conspiracy theory that has
79:11 very little movement in it but it's the
79:13 conspiracy theory that the moon is
79:15 simply the old Sun that burned out and
79:18 the only thing that happened was the new
79:19 Sun was put in place but the old ones
79:23 still up there and that's why it's white
79:26 as ash which is what happens to things
79:28 that burn and all those little pock
79:33 marks are simply the old surface cooling
79:37 off and those little bubbles are just
79:39 boom in all different sizes right the
79:44 big you know chasms I think Neil Adam
79:47 has certainly proven to me that there's
79:50 a lot of science that you know when he
79:52 takes the sea of
79:54 and shrinks it out of existence there
79:56 immediately there are craters from
79:58 volcanic explosions they're cut in half
80:01 and once he shrinks the Sea of
80:03 Tranquility the two halves come together
80:04 perfectly well that's pretty much proof
80:09 those two sides used to be together
80:10 right what are the [ __ ] odds right
80:12 there's you know hundreds of them to
80:14 come back together
80:16 interesting so anyway I want you guys to
80:19 think about that again if you're a flat
80:21 earther there's no need for you to throw
80:22 out the capability of putting a
80:25 satellite into our upper atmosphere
80:28 traveling at approximately seventeen or
80:31 thirty thousand miles an hour depending
80:33 on how much they push it and it having a
80:35 lot of Vol to crap in it so in the
80:38 coming decade from 2020 to 2030 I will
80:41 assure you that the daily churn of
80:45 things being thrown into space is going
80:47 to exponentially grow beyond anything
80:49 that you have ever witnessed in world
80:51 history
80:52 what does Elon Musk saying about SpaceX
80:55 they're going to be putting hundreds of
80:57 launches into space now he's talking
81:00 about you know pay attention to this
81:02 starship going to to Mars and of course
81:05 the starship prototype just fell apart
81:07 and fell down because the wind hit it
81:10 you know that guy sells vaporware it's
81:14 the crazy thing about Elon Musk and you
81:16 know I don't think against him
81:17 personally I think he and I probably get
81:18 along great and have a really funny
81:20 conversation but he he doesn't present
81:24 well I mean he presents atrociously he
81:27 stutters and really has a hard time and
81:31 the weird thing about it is usually that
81:35 coincides with selling [ __ ] you know
81:37 if someone says well tell me about your
81:39 life you might be okay sit down all
81:43 right got a beard good now da da da da
81:45 da da da it's your life it's just you're
81:47 confident it happened but when someone
81:50 says okay tell me about you know a
81:52 theory you've barely thought up or tell
81:54 me a lie just tell me a good lie and
81:56 then you'd be all over the map because
81:58 you'd be constantly making it up as you
81:59 go along like most the guests on coast
82:02 to coast am
82:03 or was it the alien squad channel oh my
82:07 god so you know beware of false prophets
82:13 men you know it's funny I get every once
82:16 in a while I haven't about three months
82:18 ago some guy came in the comments and he
82:20 was like oh man your shield shield
82:22 shield shield shield was like oh boy
82:24 every time you say she'll you take down
82:25 your IQ like ten points especially if
82:28 you sit against me it's just hilarious
82:29 like okay dude you have watch any videos
82:31 for sure right but you know for the
82:34 hardcore listeners you know that I come
82:35 at things from every dimension of
82:37 reality I can I can conceive literally I
82:40 have gone to the very outskirts of my
82:42 brain and picked up a rock a shiny yeah
82:45 let's make an episode about this you
82:47 know and I'm sure that some of you get
82:50 tired of some of these little little
82:52 topics that are just you know are so
82:54 esoteric you can't wrap your mind around
82:56 them and I'm sitting here talking about
82:57 it for two hours so you know I don't
83:01 want to create hysteria among the
83:03 audience I just want you two to be
83:08 heightened to what's going on and
83:10 imagine there is a crack in the armor of
83:14 how your government is set up and the
83:17 opportunity were to arise where we were
83:19 to vote on clandestine projects and
83:22 clandestine agencies that hide
83:24 technology you know area 51 being being
83:28 completely inaccessible by the people
83:31 sort of pisses me off it's like hey you
83:35 know we understand you got some covert
83:37 [ __ ] going on and you're making planes
83:39 you don't want the enemies to know all
83:41 about but there's two ways to get rid of
83:43 that problem fly the [ __ ] things out
83:45 of the out of the out of the base for a
83:48 day taking the wright-patterson Air
83:50 Force Base taking us some other place we
83:52 don't know about put them in a warehouse
83:53 or just put them in the warehouse close
83:55 the door and say there's a bunch of
83:57 guards out there if you walk past this
83:58 red line they've got the they've got the
84:01 right to blow your brains out and if you
84:02 think they're joking and you're gonna
84:04 play it like the guards for the
84:05 Buckingham Palace that's why that paddy
84:09 wagons over there and there's no
84:10 ambulances because it's shoot to kill
84:12 and they're not gonna miss and then just
84:14 let people walk around to place say okay
84:17 great this is
84:17 freaking air force base and there's
84:20 buildings we have access to in buildings
84:21 we don't have access to but again like I
84:24 said in my episode about a month and a
84:26 half before Trump announced a space
84:27 force I suggested exactly that entity
84:31 it's really from my mind it blows me
84:33 away that obviously it was in their camp
84:37 for a while before it happened but my
84:39 whole thing was you know you could have
84:42 a spacecraft what if you saw the sr-71
84:45 and in no other country had it in fact
84:49 no other country does have it okay
84:51 well they've seen it why don't they have
84:53 it we've got a stealth fighter stealth
84:55 bomber well everyone's seen it
84:57 now China ripped off the f-35 and they
85:00 ripped off the one that was actually
85:02 cancelled which Emily was Lockheed
85:04 Martin's woman which I thought was a
85:05 little sexier looking but just because
85:08 you see the exterior doesn't mean you
85:09 automatically know how it works you know
85:11 the fabric on the outside the sr-71 was
85:14 so special for absorbing radar
85:18 technology that a bunch of people got
85:19 sick making this stuff and using it
85:22 that's how complex the skin is on that
85:24 stuff so just having something painted
85:26 black doesn't reveal the chemistry of
85:29 the of the vehicle itself so I think
85:32 we've overblown unless Bob Lazar correct
85:35 of course he's talking about s4 which is
85:36 built into a mountain with mountain
85:38 looking doors that when the doors open
85:39 up in the and let things in and out then
85:42 it closes and it still looks like a
85:43 mountain that even exists right so
85:46 there's still that but I just unless we
85:50 literally have a UFO from an outside
85:51 world which everyone should be aware of
85:53 right I mean the government just has to
85:56 take a picture of it from an angle that
85:57 doesn't reveal anything I mean think
85:59 about it this way
86:00 think about it this way if okay Bob
86:04 Lazar is telling the truth which I don't
86:05 think he is because of his two degrees
86:07 in two different places and it would
86:09 take up so much time in his life it
86:11 would register in his history he would
86:12 have alumni shirts from Boston he mm
86:15 nice shirts from Caltech one does not
86:17 get a PhD at a college without at least
86:18 grabbing some chatzky some schwag right
86:21 he has nothing he has no photographs
86:23 being on that camp either one of the
86:24 campuses think the guy's a bold-faced
86:26 liar but I think he's were creative and
86:28 very entertaining
86:29 but let's just say he calls his UFO the
86:32 space sports model that's what I have
86:34 landing in the backyard all right okay
86:38 so let's say they have that thing all
86:41 right let's say they have it and they
86:42 take a picture of it and put it on the
86:44 web and they announce that they've got a
86:45 UFO and they've had it forever they
86:48 found it in a dig they not sure if it's
86:50 from Earth or if it's from outer space
86:52 or whatever what does that do for anyone
86:56 what makes a bunch of you apologist
86:58 extremely happy and me included and
87:00 probably a lot of you but it doesn't
87:02 tell us how it works right Bob Lazar
87:04 supposedly talked about the element 115
87:06 and the antimatter engines okay
87:08 Russia's heard that China's heard that
87:11 everyone's heard it does anyone have
87:13 UFOs working like that no so a picture
87:17 of is not gonna hurt anything which
87:19 lends itself to it being a work of
87:21 fiction I make the point about the UFO
87:24 because the project Aurora the triangle
87:27 thing which has been photographed how
87:29 many times now right so you got a
87:32 triangle you take a picture of it you
87:34 take a picture of a flying all right we
87:37 think we actually have real pictures of
87:38 this thing all right it doesn't tell the
87:40 Russians how we made it
87:41 you know now if Obama was still
87:44 president and he had access to it you
87:46 would have given it to China that's what
87:48 he did with all of our launch codes and
87:50 everything else he sold us out man and
87:53 it will be written at some point in
87:54 history but this doesn't you know this
87:57 is why these covert programs make no
87:59 sense if we had anti-gravity how am i
88:03 how impressed would you be I mean how
88:05 mind blown would you be in minutes an
88:08 earth time if the government said yeah
88:11 here it is boom pretty cool right it's a
88:14 little video we did in area 51 or some
88:16 other weird place all right does it tell
88:19 anybody how it works
88:20 no and what if Russia was like oh we've
88:23 had it too for you know 55 years and so
88:26 they do their thing and now we all know
88:27 this technology exists well does anyone
88:34 have the balls to go now you give it to
88:36 me man I want a Blade Runner car I want
88:38 a Fifth Element car No
88:41 they're perfectly fine with their
88:43 government having that technology at
88:45 least we know now that it exists if
88:49 they've got a little alien in warehouse
88:50 playing poker nice to see that wouldn't
88:52 it so that's why I bring these subjects
88:56 up so we kind of pierced through the
88:57 veil but I think unequivocally in
89:02 history where technology is hidden it is
89:05 aimed at you and that's what you're not
89:08 allowed to know so if there's a break in
89:12 the [ __ ] of armor or we can wreath row
89:16 the policies of the world one country at
89:18 a time but then let's do it let's get in
89:22 there and let's bring it up to our
89:25 friends and spouses I mean hail an idea
89:26 is something you can't kill right but if
89:29 there's a big movement to declassify the
89:31 entire planet let's all pretend like
89:34 we're made equal instead of allowing
89:36 certain people to covet stuff and become
89:41 more than our equals because they could
89:45 dominate us you know I would think that
89:47 there should be some global moratorium
89:49 on mind-control because no one has the
89:52 right to do that
89:53 we're all sovereign beings no one has
89:56 the right to do that anybody who
89:57 believes they can and should mmm you
90:02 know again here's how I can sell you
90:04 mind control ready
90:05 should you be mind controlled ever in
90:08 your whole life
90:10 mmm no maybe for going under surgery and
90:14 you're all anxiety about your heart
90:15 surgery but it's a thing it's the
90:16 difference between you dying and you
90:18 being alive maybe I can mind-control you
90:20 to feel good with it maybe you'd buy off
90:22 on that but overall no no don't make me
90:25 want to vote for Hillary Clinton don't
90:27 ever do that to me okay so you don't
90:30 want that to happen to you maybe they
90:31 make you Manchurian Candidate and kills
90:33 kill your wife so you go to jail
90:35 because they want to frame you and you
90:37 wake up out of this thing you got blood
90:38 dripping all over and you're like what
90:39 did I do and they're like hehehe the
90:41 white van dries away from your house you
90:44 don't want that to happen right
90:47 okay now pick your favorite boogeyman on
90:50 planet earth any race any country
90:54 whatever you're afraid of now the
90:57 military guys sits down in front of you
90:59 he's got it he's dressed to the nines
91:02 man he starched out he's awesome got the
91:04 crew cut it's all good he's on your side
91:07 boy you feel good he's on your side cuz
91:09 he looks like a badass mofos or her and
91:13 they say we're gonna go over there to
91:15 your enemy and we're gonna make them all
91:18 kill each other or we're gonna make them
91:20 love america or whatever we can't put a
91:23 specific thought about love america so
91:24 we're just gonna go with this suicide
91:26 depression algorithm and they'll just be
91:28 wiped off the planet it'll be a self
91:30 genocide
91:32 now most st. people we go well [ __ ] no
91:35 man I I gotta meet God at some point I
91:37 mean you're gonna tell me this and then
91:39 you're gonna make me go to my creator
91:41 thinking this is happening you know this
91:43 is horrible
91:44 but you know a ton of people would be
91:46 totally for it Ben it's not them it's
91:49 not them like it takes you back that old
91:52 saying you know first they came for the
91:54 so-and-so's and took him away and I
91:56 didn't say anything and then they came
91:57 for the next group and they took him
91:59 away and I didn't say anything and then
92:00 they came from me and there's no one
92:02 left to protest so they took me away too
92:06 that's why we gotta be careful but what
92:10 if there's no means to take anybody away
92:12 there is no means to do this kind of
92:14 stuff to anyone yeah maybe we have to
92:17 get along a little bit better at least
92:19 someone can't Death Reyes out of
92:21 existence
92:23 beware of the skies how many of you know
92:27 about chemtrails and want them to end
92:29 geez if there was any metaphor for
92:34 satellite technology screwing with your
92:36 mind screwing with the world a chem
92:39 trail is the most perfect example of
92:42 [ __ ] being sprayed over your house that
92:44 you can't do anything with and boy they
92:46 are still firing off like crazy under
92:48 Donald Trump's administration so someone
92:52 is sold someone a bill of goods
92:54 all the way to the tippy top maybe that
92:56 one's you know I mean this cute [ __ ]
92:58 that he's oldest yeah he's been taking
93:00 over and all their [ __ ]
93:00 supercomputers have been destroyed
93:02 and the Big Bird satellites been
93:04 destroyed and all this other [ __ ]
93:05 horseshit
93:06 oh yeah well then why the [ __ ] do I have
93:08 you know chemical spray in the sky and
93:10 then everyone my neighbor gets a ripping
93:12 throat and if they don't take vitamin C
93:14 falls into their lungs and they got two
93:16 months of respiratory problems why do
93:18 all the urgent cares in my neighborhood
93:23 have Kim sure along as the secret
93:26 condition that everybody's suffering
93:27 from when these things spray in the sky
93:30 because it's extremely real what is
93:32 every pilot I talk to you say yeah I
93:34 totally exist and it's not me and you
93:36 can't talk about them because this is
93:37 worse than talking about a UFO sighting
93:39 shit's real men don't know why they
93:44 think they're doing it bunch of theories
93:45 I know it makes us sick you know no
93:50 doctor nurse knows what's in a
93:51 vaccination but they think it's you know
93:54 GMO your body it's the best thing don't
93:57 eat GMO foods though be a totally
93:59 crunchy vegetarian that doesn't need
94:00 GMOs
94:01 we go get all your shots because that's
94:03 good man I tell you having a high IQ
94:07 will save your life
94:09 thinking will save your life this is
94:13 actually if you think about it in 1800s
94:16 your lineage moving down the only thing
94:19 that would threaten your lineage would
94:20 be a war or a plague and today it's just
94:26 simply picking the wrong food you know
94:29 eating too much sugar eating too much
94:31 sugar substitutes you know brush your
94:33 teeth with fluoride all these things I
94:36 could wave in your food all these things
94:39 add up exactly like the plot to the 1989
94:43 Batman movie the Tim Burton put out it
94:46 was the combination of products in your
94:49 house that would make you die boy you
94:53 put it right on the point showed
94:54 everybody in the world and nobody got it
94:56 well that's a fictional story mm-hmm
94:59 yeah that's why record number of people
95:01 are dying of cancers by children at a
95:03 record level are getting cancer
95:06 I was just at the lounge yesterday no
95:11 two days ago guy came in with his wife
95:13 he's a great Duty he comes to lunch all
95:15 the time and I just happened to rattle
95:18 off a little too quick the optimism I
95:22 have about curing a particular instance
95:24 of cancer in a particular individual
95:26 they can catch it again you can always
95:27 catch it again change your habits right
95:29 in any instance you have go watch my
95:31 cancer episode there's a million ways to
95:33 cure it that particular instance you
95:35 have and then he said something like my
95:39 brother died two days ago of cancer no
95:41 no [ __ ] and of course they don't want to
95:44 hear about cures at that point cuz
95:46 they're like I don't wanna hear that he
95:47 could have lived and so I have the
95:52 courage to to get the cures when we can
95:56 you walked out of there completely
95:58 unequipped to save his own life from
96:00 cancer because it's too much of a slap
96:02 in the face that he lost a relative to
96:04 it I just lost one to it too so anyway
96:07 hope you feel me I am going to do a
96:11 short bumper today and by the way I'm
96:13 conceptualizing a common bumper to this
96:18 but I really hate those totally you know
