00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies
00:32 John so I cut this poor Domo lot 23 the
00:39 claim was that this tobacco is twelve
00:41 years old
00:43 it was only eight bucks so that's pretty
00:45 amazing pull this massive label off
00:52 I don't smoke as much anymore I do one
00:57 for the show but then again I don't do a
00:59 show every single day anymore as you can
01:01 see this title of this episode is no
01:04 your enemies
01:06 and I think that it's a fascinating
01:08 concept which is I mean an episode
01:13 called fake enemies which was
01:15 immediately demonetized because I
01:17 suggested for a split second during the
01:20 episode that maybe Russia is in our arch
01:23 enemy and what's interesting is is that
01:27 throughout any day of the week there's
01:31 some pundits some op-ed piece in
01:34 newspaper online rag or television show
01:39 that it's trying to convince us that
01:41 we're going to war with someone you know
01:44 always America and Russia it's like if
01:47 you really just dial back the rhetoric
01:48 and look at what's actually happening in
01:51 the world nothing is happening between
01:53 the two of us right if nothing else
01:56 Russia is gone you know virtually
01:59 capitalistic they are doing their own
02:02 thing still a rough rough and tough kind
02:05 of Wild West over there but it's their
02:08 world they're taking care of it they're
02:09 used to it now the big thing is
02:12 obviously China and the thing is is that
02:19 the average human being simply wants to
02:21 live their lives get their destiny have
02:23 their kids if they're gonna have any
02:25 kids be left alone 24/7 and that's
02:30 typically what every human being with an
02:33 IQ wants everywhere around the world I
02:37 think that when that becomes interrupted
02:40 the process by which you find your
02:42 destinies your education and experience
02:44 then you can find yourself a lost soul
02:47 and that's when you're up for harvesting
02:50 there was a just a great moment for
02:54 everyone to see when you try to
02:56 understand that archetype and the movie
02:59 frighteners which is the movie about a
03:01 kid who is living with a single mom and
03:05 a vampire moves in next door which is
03:09 the the IO King powder King from
03:13 Princess Bride just is this amazing
03:16 actor man
03:18 and then slowly he's looking through the
03:20 window and he's seen the other guy on
03:22 the other side become a vampire -
03:24 vampire things and so he then tells his
03:28 buddies say man this guy's vampire and
03:30 it gets it's all the way I think the end
03:32 of Act two were one of the nerdiest kids
03:34 in the bunch who is constantly made fun
03:37 of remember that's how you make
03:39 sociopaths that destroy the world so
03:41 it'd be nice to everybody they well the
03:47 vampire at one point pulls open his cape
03:50 and he says aren't you tired of being
03:51 made fun of aren't you tired of having
03:53 no power aren't you tired of you know
03:55 being the outcast come with me I'll bite
03:58 you I'll turn you into one of us and
04:00 you'll fly like a bat and you'll have
04:02 all this amazing power and the kid was
04:05 crying and sobbing he knows it's wrong
04:07 but he also knows that that that's the
04:11 best thing he hat's right so he converts
04:14 and he becomes a nemesis to the rest of
04:17 his friends so that's what we're gonna
04:21 talk about is essentially you know no
04:27 one should have any enemies whatsoever
04:29 but when the press constantly tells you
04:32 to have an enemy think about it think
04:35 about there's a meme that went around
04:38 was I don't let my friends tell me what
04:40 friends I can have and I think that's
04:42 interesting because it's a little bit
04:44 more of a twist on the algorithm of
04:46 finding you know determining who your
04:48 enemies are which is that would you even
04:53 let your closest friend tell you who
04:56 your enemies are and if they're going to
04:59 do that they better have a good case for
05:00 it you know so the fact that the press
05:04 has nothing to do with your life at all
05:06 and politicians have nothing to do with
05:07 your life at all I mean seriously they
05:10 don't represent you they don't protect
05:11 you they don't improve your life they
05:13 raise your taxes they regulate your
05:16 businesses they bring in European
05:19 agendas to destroy your kids education
05:21 to destroy your food supplies and to
05:25 destroy your communities in general so
05:29 it's all these things that we should
05:30 probably come up with some require
05:32 you know to figure out who how would we
05:35 even begin to evaluate an enemy what
05:39 would it have to be what and know what
05:43 was going on I started in episode and
05:46 there's just got to be [ __ ]
05:47 construction this word of Christ I think
05:50 the goal is to acknowledge the
05:54 difference between you know an enemy and
05:57 perhaps someone you disagree with I
06:01 think an enemy has got to require some
06:06 some qualifications right so someone who
06:11 believes something that you don't
06:12 believe but they're not doing any harm
06:14 to you or to your family or to your
06:16 friends that's just a disagreement where
06:19 someone is actively destroying and doing
06:22 harm that's where I think we can start
06:24 to keep a tally on someone right and so
06:29 again what's interesting about it is
06:31 that take religion for instance we all
06:34 disagree about something within religion
06:37 whether or not we think we're on the
06:38 same page or not but think about a
06:39 congregation goes to a building they do
06:42 their thing they come out and they go
06:43 back to work if that's all they do they
06:46 don't bother you whatsoever now if they
06:49 get in there and start trying to
06:50 manipulate politics and policy and you
06:53 have to take a look at that influence on
06:55 your life if they go door to door it
06:59 just depends how pushy they are most of
07:03 them aren't
07:03 I mean 99.9 percent or not that pushy
07:06 they say can I talk to you so you know
07:08 not right now
07:09 rather not okay thank you very much have
07:11 a good day and they walk off hey can't
07:14 blame someone for trying so with the
07:19 current agendas in 2020 if we just take
07:24 the basics and say okay they have to be
07:26 doing harm to us again to you personally
07:29 or the whole nation or the whole world
07:32 then it's pretty easy to find some
07:36 organizations that we have to
07:38 acknowledge and then we have to get our
07:41 ducks in a row meaning you have to know
07:43 exactly what it is they're doing
07:47 so that you can communicate it to
07:49 somebody else the other one is that
07:54 there being a lot of times these enemies
07:56 will be affecting people meaning
08:00 changing their lives for the for the
08:01 worse and they don't know it it's like
08:04 an invisible force that they don't
08:06 understand and so they have an issue
08:08 trying to realize like why can't I get
08:11 my business started what the hell is
08:12 going on I'm trying to build a house on
08:14 my own land in the city and the ER the
08:16 council or the county won't zone me for
08:19 my own land you know again we might be
08:22 able to tell where we're going with some
08:24 of these enemies you also have you have
08:29 agendas that have names that are your
08:32 enemies and then you have individuals
08:34 that fuel the agendas and that's where
08:37 it gets a little tricky because someone
08:39 could be duped into forcing an agenda on
08:44 you and then you could have someone work
08:49 long long term 20 years 30 years to push
08:52 the agenda I did an episode earlier this
08:55 year called the big picture I think it
08:59 was like 20 20 or something like that
09:01 there's a bit of information in that as
09:03 well but what's fascinating is is that
09:08 awareness is everything right once you
09:12 put the spotlight on an enemy you then
09:15 can and you really light it up and the
09:18 metaphor there is you're passed around
09:19 information you're passing around proof
09:21 that these organizations exist and then
09:25 to the degree you can walk up to an
09:26 individual and say hey have you ever had
09:28 this happen to you and they say oh yeah
09:29 totally
09:30 is that what it was what's up with that
09:32 it's really weird you say okay I'm
09:34 bringing it up because I figured out at
09:37 least part of what you know might be
09:39 causing this problem for you just wanted
09:41 to highlight it so you have it in your
09:43 backpack of stuff right now what's
09:46 interesting is as I recently had a
09:48 conversation yesterday with the
09:52 gentleman he's gonna be running for
09:53 office and he's an old school baby
09:57 boomer so his
10:00 inclination is to stay away from
10:03 conspiracy theories right and of course
10:07 we know how that goes that means that in
10:09 terms of who's really running the world
10:11 what's actually happening in his life he
10:15 will fail to get elected because he
10:18 doesn't know how the game works and he
10:19 won't acknowledge it because of whatever
10:21 reason it's always a lack of information
10:24 that gets people to continue on without
10:28 acknowledging the truth the other one is
10:31 obviously the algorithm we talk about
10:33 all the time which is some enemies are
10:36 so vicious and all-encompassing and and
10:40 they do things that are so atrocious
10:42 that a bunch of human beings can't
10:45 imagine that someone else is more evil
10:47 than they are which is something I
10:49 always have to remind friends and I say
10:51 look I know this all sounds crazy but
10:53 just remember you're a good person
10:55 everyone likes to be complimented right
10:57 so you're a good person I know you could
10:59 not imagine this ever doing this
11:03 personally and so I understand why are
11:07 we telling you this exceeds any you know
11:10 capability you have so let's talk about
11:14 some enemies part of it has to do with
11:17 we have to make a list of things in our
11:19 own mind that we think we have the right
11:21 to and you can't well I should say this
11:26 much the list you should make should be
11:28 inalienable rights that you have because
11:30 you simply exist in this universe as a
11:33 human being
11:34 perhaps if we're a different being
11:36 there's different rights that we need
11:39 because we have different needs but as
11:41 long as you're human being you have
11:44 things that you need and freedom is the
11:47 number one thing that anyone needs on
11:49 this planet because without freedom
11:52 you're just a cog in a wheel you don't
11:55 determine anything so your existence is
11:57 then immediately trivialized and if you
12:00 die and a freedom less world well it
12:03 doesn't matter that you ever lived in
12:04 the first place because another human
12:07 being is going to take your place on the
12:09 wheel
12:12 and I think most of us want some
12:14 relevance to our life right especially
12:16 the more that you understand life and if
12:18 you're young one of the things that
12:21 doesn't occur to you right away is let's
12:23 say you're young and you're struggling
12:25 especially with this crazy economy we
12:28 have now in the crazy world that we have
12:29 now it always seems to it always seems
12:33 like whatever
12:34 trial and tribulation you're facing
12:36 right now is going to be infinite it's
12:39 gonna last forever and the truth of the
12:42 matter is is that as long as we don't
12:43 give up on the experiment of freedom
12:46 hardships always pass I mean go study
12:50 the economy of England in the 70s it was
12:52 atrocious
12:53 but then they had a boom era after that
12:55 even America you know even though we had
12:59 a fairly decent economy in the 70s we
13:01 had a nine-year war in Vietnam and even
13:06 a little bit longer than that but we had
13:08 this big war and you know kids are
13:10 getting killed also stuff you think it's
13:12 never gonna stop whoever thought the
13:14 Middle Eastern Wars would be stopped by
13:16 Trump nobody
13:19 Tony Rockefeller told Aaron Rizzo this
13:21 is a 99-year war and it's gonna be
13:24 ushering in the 22nd century and no
13:29 one's gonna be able to find the enemy
13:30 because it's gonna be this nebulous
13:32 terrorist group that no one could put a
13:34 finger on you know it's not Russia it's
13:36 not Afghanistan or Iran or anything it's
13:39 just this group of people that have this
13:41 name they burned out al-qaeda then they
13:46 let it go and then john mccain brought
13:48 us isis and so they rebranded the whole
13:52 thing so that right now it's still a
13:57 concern of ours we have repairs to do
13:59 with relationships we have with other
14:02 parts of the world if you're European or
14:04 American it's going to take take a while
14:10 prosperity is the best way to fix
14:12 anything right bring everyone prosperity
14:15 I'm [ __ ] real there wasn't any noise
14:18 out here at all before I start my
14:19 episode the second I hit record on my
14:22 camera
14:23 there's a [ __ ] shovel on goddamn
14:25 cement it's [ __ ] up all the audio
14:29 takes a while to set this thing up so
14:31 it's a [ __ ] bummer when it gets
14:34 sabotage [ __ ] with my brain trying to
14:38 think straight well you get this goddamn
14:39 grinding sound in the back of your
14:40 [ __ ] head so you know that I have done
14:45 hundreds and hundreds of episodes try to
14:47 identify literally what is against us
14:50 and what is for us again it's it's my
14:53 best approximation of the situation
14:56 right so definitely you know don't take
15:00 my word for it go research it what's
15:02 nice is is that because there's so many
15:04 red pill people out there with
15:07 backgrounds in the area of our concern
15:13 who have discovered this identified this
15:16 they've taken losses because of it we
15:19 have much better sources now than we
15:20 ever have had in the past and we've had
15:23 some heroes obviously in the past the
15:27 trouble with some of the sources in the
15:30 past is they all sold a book they sold a
15:32 movie they sold something and so every
15:35 time that occurs you kind of know damn
15:37 you know it's not that that's not
15:39 completely true and they're trying to to
15:41 spread information through movies and
15:44 books but I think that when their income
15:48 depends on those mechanisms there's just
15:52 a survival mechanism that attaches to
15:54 things and then what ends up happening
15:57 is sometimes the fear-mongering around
16:00 the issue is the main topic that the
16:04 main method they use to get us to buy
16:07 the product so we can find the solution
16:09 right you hear this all the time this
16:11 whole baiting you into buying something
16:13 is such an old scam you know there's a
16:16 guy with the just the digress for one
16:18 second the guy that does the video you
16:20 probably run into on Facebook I think at
16:24 least Facebook but the guy starts out
16:26 he's totally ripped he's lifting way
16:27 she's totally ripping he goes you know
16:29 there's certain foods you can eat that
16:30 will you know burn fat blah blah blah
16:33 needles his big pitch and then it's like
16:35 course you got to click the button to
16:36 find out and you got to pay 19 bucks for
16:38 his information you could just put her
16:40 in a search engine and find in two
16:41 seconds
16:42 people went all the way through and then
16:43 came back and posted the what they found
16:46 on the other side being just some
16:47 trivial information so hopefully at some
16:50 point that methodology of spreading
16:52 information is is relatively demonized
16:56 if you invent something then obviously
16:59 behind a pay barrier might make some
17:01 more sense but just extorting human
17:04 health to people is not not the greatest
17:09 thing in the loan so enemies I think the
17:12 number one thing as I keep saying and I
17:15 think I've been validated this year and
17:17 I'm just one of many people I'm a late
17:19 comer to the details on this but agenda
17:22 21 which again is a organization that
17:27 says well it's now an organization but
17:29 it was a movement that came out of the
17:31 early 90s it must have been planned for
17:34 decades before this thing came out which
17:37 is a global depopulation final in game
17:42 of where we're going everything we're
17:46 seeing today is poetically and amazingly
17:49 congruent with agenda 21 the pandemic is
17:53 all part of their control apparatus
17:55 trying to change the world with a bunch
17:58 more control app control mechanisms so
18:00 you can't go to a grocery store without
18:02 standing in some line to get in because
18:05 of some ridiculous capacity issues that
18:07 you know six foot distancing masking and
18:10 all this kind of stuff because there are
18:13 attorneys that we have allowed to bring
18:16 frivolous case after frivolous case in
18:18 to courts now these organizations even
18:21 if they were good are terrified of
18:23 getting sued by someone who gets ills
18:26 and so they adhere to all this pandemic
18:29 crap because they know that the World
18:32 Health Organization which is one of the
18:33 enemies that enables the Jena 21 has set
18:38 a precedence for the court case no
18:39 matter where you are in the world that
18:41 you can sue someone if you could prove
18:43 that you know shopping cart handle
18:45 wasn't cleaned someone was allowed to
18:48 get too close to you know christ
18:49 almighty if you're wearing gloves and a
18:51 mask
18:53 what can you catch right and
18:55 and how could you possibly expose
18:57 another human being now of course gloves
18:59 are a bad idea no matter what the whole
19:01 thing is a bad idea now the reason why I
19:04 obsess on 21 Jena 21 which is now also
19:07 gender 2030 which should scare you to
19:09 death that we're seeing too much this
19:11 movement in 2020 and their plans for
19:14 2030 it's nothing short of cataclysmic I
19:20 think because even if you're a red
19:23 pillar and I tell you that they're gonna
19:25 remove 99 percent of the world's
19:27 population your brain can't conceive of
19:30 them your brain can't conceive that you
19:34 will have a 99 percent chance of dying
19:37 yourself any legacy you ever put
19:41 together will be erased whether or not
19:43 you're Steven Spielberg and you made a
19:45 bunch of movies everybody remembers it's
19:47 all erased your kids erased
19:50 everything's erased and so that is
19:53 something that I think we have to kind
19:55 of meditate on to the point you can
19:58 realize that look at what they've just
20:00 done they've destroyed the world economy
20:03 it's going to take some pretty strong
20:05 minded individuals to resurrect their
20:07 economy to go back outside and just
20:09 literally ignore the World Health
20:12 Organization just ignore them
20:14 those of us that are red pills like you
20:17 and myself we know that they will try to
20:21 drop a second virus now today they've
20:25 dropped this thing this common cold this
20:28 extreme common cold on everybody they
20:31 faked a bunch of numbers for who died of
20:33 it knew you know got sick of it and
20:34 tested for it there's now evidence
20:37 coming out in April 30th that it was in
20:41 America before it ever got out of China
20:43 it was in Europe before it ever got out
20:45 of China so this looks like someone
20:47 intentionally put this stuff here and it
20:51 looks to me like somebody linked to
20:54 another person and said well it's just a
20:55 common cold it's just been given an S
20:58 protein from SARS to help it spread
21:00 faster to humans we're not really
21:02 interested in killing off a bunch of
21:04 people what we're interested in is the
21:05 controlled mechanisms that are the
21:06 result of the fear that we
21:09 that this thing is killed a bunch of
21:11 people again part of it is you know one
21:19 of these situations where we have a deep
21:24 state that hasn't told you what they're
21:26 doing they haven't come up to your face
21:28 and said we're the deep state you will
21:31 behave because we have enough [ __ ]
21:35 you know 90 IQ cops out there which you
21:38 are few and far between there enough
21:40 there in every precinct there's always a
21:42 few [ __ ] numbskull Hightower's which
21:45 will run out there and arrest somebody
21:46 you know beat up a fourteen-year-old kid
21:48 because he smoked two Swisher sweet you
21:50 know there's always someone out there
21:52 and so we will always have what we have
21:54 until the chief of police and the
21:57 sheriff's and they're the older guys in
21:59 their 30s
22:00 remember the IQ who never ceases it
22:03 keeps going up and up and up and so once
22:05 these older guys and gals see the
22:08 overall agenda if they especially
22:10 threatened us but what happened is the
22:13 sheriff's will get that the Chief of
22:14 Police would get that the generals will
22:16 get it the commanders would get it that
22:18 were under attack and then we would
22:21 fight back categorically again you can't
22:24 throw a frog into a hot boiling pot of
22:26 water he will jump out you warm him up
22:29 slowly over time and he dies this is
22:31 what they've done is they are hiding
22:33 underneath officials of course they also
22:37 have their shelley governors like the
22:39 one in michigan and was a south carolina
22:44 and you know you've got folks that are
22:47 against the Second Amendment they're
22:49 just absolute idiots thinking that the
22:55 promises that they've been told that
22:56 they're on some list but they're gonna
22:58 be part of the chosen few at the end of
23:00 hell what if they even were what kind of
23:03 world would they live in everything that
23:05 you do for a pastime would be shut down
23:08 so you know let's run run through a few
23:10 scenarios let's say a guy likes to go to
23:14 a lake and ski or he likes to go to
23:17 Disneyland or something right
23:19 well all of those locations even if you
23:22 get to the lake
23:23 of your choice and you're hanging out
23:26 with just a couple other you know folks
23:28 like you that's not what a while aches
23:30 are fun Lakes are fun because you're
23:33 with a community of people you don't
23:35 necessarily want them sitting on your
23:36 beach towel but you don't want to be out
23:38 there by yourself you want to be able to
23:39 pull over to a to a bar on the side of
23:42 the beach that you've never been to
23:43 before and have a conversation with a
23:45 stranger and have some fun any of you
23:48 guys out there that have met someone met
23:50 another dude in public and it resulted
23:53 in you getting work whether you end up
23:55 working for that personally end up
23:56 working for you or you have services
23:58 that you exchange all that would
24:00 disappear so the fun of being alive
24:03 starts to disappear okay so the whole
24:06 world is yours how many movies have been
24:08 made where it's like the last man
24:10 standing
24:10 even without zombies you know it's like
24:13 you're on earth by yourself once yeah
24:15 cast away was that a movie about how
24:18 happy Tom Hanks was to be on an island a
24:20 tropical beautiful island by himself no
24:22 it was him going through stages of
24:24 insanity until finally he gets rescued
24:27 and then comes back to the world
24:28 permanently damaged for being on that
24:31 island maybe if he lives to be 80 he he
24:35 gets through it so agenda21
24:39 remember it is every it is in every
24:43 corner of the world that they can
24:45 physically push it into it's sort of
24:48 like the way that what it Bruce Lee
24:50 defined being like water you put it in a
24:53 glass and water shapes itself like a
24:55 glass put it in the teapot and it shapes
24:57 itself like the teapot he always told us
25:00 to be like water because it's an it's
25:02 the beautiful one of the most powerful
25:05 metaphors for adaptation and when you're
25:08 fighting you have to adapt because
25:09 people bring skills in that you don't
25:11 know they gotta have a move that you
25:12 don't know they're fast they're jab
25:13 whatever they got a good kick or
25:15 whatever and so we're trying to be Bruce
25:19 Lee in this world against globalism and
25:25 there's a lot more people waking up but
25:29 now censorship has become a huge
25:31 mechanism right in our face in a country
25:34 like America where you know freedom of
25:36 speech
25:37 is gigantic if you get caught in most
25:40 capacities inhibiting free speech
25:44 there's there's loss you get prosecuted
25:46 you get a get to you know spend some
25:50 time in the old pokey but right now
25:53 Facebook is censoring Twitter is
25:56 censoring YouTube is censoring and
25:58 they're censoring on behalf of the World
26:00 Health Organization that has been deemed
26:02 absolutely incompetent no matter how you
26:04 cut the information they missed it so
26:11 what's interesting about the algorithm
26:14 is you can leverage those failures and
26:17 the support of those failures against
26:18 those that would prop up this tyranny I
26:23 don't know about you but I got all the
26:25 way through high school never knowing
26:29 what tyranny meant never knowing the
26:31 word serf and really never being told
26:34 much about history that was accurate and
26:41 I think that should be a little
26:42 frightening you know but now agenda 21
26:47 is so massive and so proliferated into
26:50 every nook and cranny of our surely
26:52 politicians remember it goes from the
26:55 mayor all the way up to usually the
26:58 president this particular time around we
27:00 don't have a agenda 20 Pro agenda 21
27:02 president United States but I don't know
27:04 of any leaders in other countries may be
27:06 Pullen isn't on board
27:09 seems like Italy's finding back the
27:11 Ukraine is definitely fighting back but
27:14 you don't know but wherever you are you
27:16 have to take inventory if your neural
27:18 it's really really tough because
27:20 everyone's pro-eu at the pulpit the Pope
27:23 political level I've never heard of any
27:26 massive dissent besides that one German
27:28 a woman who was actually hauled out of
27:31 the EU and put in jail right and then
27:33 she later got elected for office so you
27:36 do have a few folks fighting back but
27:38 they shouldn't be doing this all by
27:40 themselves that's the bummer they should
27:43 have a posse behind them saying yeah
27:47 we're not for this you know the look at
27:49 what's happening
27:50 United States and then compared to the
27:52 Paris rights you have cops arresting
27:56 housewife's with no masks the cops have
27:59 no masks she has no mass they're better
28:01 than her they're higher than her God
28:03 apparently has bestowed these cops with
28:06 you know the ability to just make up
28:09 rules out of thin air
28:11 that are unconstitutional I hope she
28:14 sues their balls off right but parents
28:17 they just walked down the streets and
28:18 that's cool but you know the I watched a
28:23 I watch the video we're in New Guinea
28:26 there's an area of New Guinea where a
28:29 bunch of people rose up against
28:31 corruption and then marched on the
28:33 capital building and the dude gave up
28:36 his position within about an hour to
28:39 intercept for the greater good of my
28:41 country obviously we have an issue here
28:43 I'm gone he's like I don't get killed no
28:46 way home tonight that mechanism has been
28:49 used to do good and that mechanism has
28:51 been used to do bat you know marching on
28:55 capitals South America was utterly taken
28:57 over by co-opted groups from
29:00 intelligence agencies such that the
29:02 world bank then loans them a bunch of
29:04 stuff and cleans them out forever so
29:08 maybe don't know I'm sure these French
29:11 people are very smart I don't know if
29:13 it'd be more effective to say okay don't
29:16 necessarily go down Paris streets go to
29:19 the go to macrons house you know go to
29:22 someplace where the people that are
29:24 responsible for what you don't like are
29:26 inside the building and just peacefully
29:29 let them know but the French have been
29:32 very amazing with world history and
29:37 chopping heads off of people that they
29:38 don't like running their country it
29:40 seems interesting that we have no point
29:42 of reference for wasn't the 1770s right
29:46 where all those beheadings occurred were
29:48 supposedly the pace who were family
29:49 smuggle one of their kids into America
29:51 you know was it easier back then I don't
29:54 know I don't know I mean if you have an
29:56 army that protects the king and the
29:59 Queen it's all relative right so you
30:02 have backhoes and Mei
30:04 be a sword or maybe I guess a flint gun
30:08 or something like that and they've got
30:10 the same thing and so maybe they have
30:13 the best of the best because they're all
30:14 financed it just seems like that's a
30:15 very tough thing to do now I think today
30:20 our punishment for some of this stuff
30:23 gets you know it's a lot more humane you
30:25 just go to jail if you happen to be
30:27 caught violating or cooing your country
30:29 and then you're out of commission but
30:33 the problem is that we're always we're
30:34 always catching and prosecuting they're
30:38 the elites employees never the elite
30:41 themselves because they have figured out
30:44 the abstraction of mercenaries and that
30:47 for those of you that doesn't click in
30:49 your brain what that means is I hire
30:51 someone else to do the job for me and we
30:54 have a pact that if they get caught they
30:56 take the hit they don't squeal and I do
30:59 whatever I can through other proxy
31:01 chains to finance their attorneys to get
31:04 them out of jail to reward them for
31:06 taking a hit for me they're supposed to
31:09 be good enough not to get caught which
31:11 is what the theory is of why you know
31:13 hey it's it's up to you men you need to
31:15 get the job done don't take the job if
31:17 you can't get it done so if you get
31:18 caught it's your own fault
31:19 I'll give you anything that you want to
31:21 get the job done and that's what they've
31:23 done for centuries it's the easiest
31:26 place on earth that's this first world
31:29 to solve this problem in my estimation
31:32 is America because one we have a
31:36 foundational belief that we are free
31:39 human beings and that no one's going to
31:42 tell us what to do we are not to hurt
31:43 any other citizens and we shouldn't be
31:46 engaging in wars that are propaganda
31:48 based wars which is another mechanism of
31:51 allowing someone you don't even know to
31:54 tell you who the enemy is you're
31:57 supposed to be able to trust the
31:58 president United States but remember
32:00 after 9/11 you had George George Bush
32:03 jr. walk out and say that North Korea
32:07 was an axis of evil I mean no one was
32:09 even talking about North Korea in
32:11 America just so you know if you're in
32:12 Europe we didn't sit around worried
32:14 about Kim jong-il I hadn't even
32:17 you know I was I guess in my early 30s
32:20 when that's the State of the Union
32:22 speech happened and I can't say I was
32:26 trying to file follow like world
32:27 politics in any tremendous way but it
32:31 came out of thin air from my brain I was
32:33 like what North Korea what's up with
32:35 North Korea oh you know it's a it's a
32:37 weird sequestered country is like oh
32:39 really yeah what's the deal all his
32:41 family and the Kim family and blah it's
32:43 that's sort of why I learned about Korea
32:47 in the first place
32:48 North Korea but when you compare North
32:52 Korea to like the kpop movement in South
32:54 Korea you just can't push those two
32:56 worlds together in your brain you're
32:57 like god that's just two totally
32:59 opposite worlds right so within agenda21
33:07 again Rosa Cory I can't reference her
33:12 enough you if you're interested in
33:15 becoming part of the solution to get rid
33:17 of agenda 21 which again if you get rid
33:20 of agenda 21 you don't need to worry
33:22 about any other sub conspiracy because
33:24 they're all underneath agenda 21 you
33:26 will so rid the world of evil that
33:30 whatever is left is crumbs on the ground
33:32 easy to sweep up no problem my
33:37 recommendation to you there's a 2012
33:40 presentation by Rosa Cory that I saw
33:43 that she was at the New Hampshire on her
33:47 no Senate or something and she was in
33:49 this room was in a Senate room or
33:52 anything it was like an office room she
33:53 had just traveled there she'd caught a
33:55 cold so the first third of it she's
33:57 fighting through coughing unfortunately
33:59 she's apologized but she doesn't slip
34:01 during the entire presentation but what
34:04 she does is she lets you know through
34:06 evidence she's an attorney right if you
34:09 haven't heard of this one before she was
34:11 an eminent domain attorney for the state
34:13 of California trying to appraise the
34:15 value of land before the state stole it
34:17 from human beings right and so she
34:19 realized there's no way you can truly
34:21 evaluate land unless you do massive
34:23 surveying there could be a gold mine
34:25 underneath the copper mine underneath
34:27 could be great for growing particular
34:29 crops itself for a lot of money
34:31 and so she then started seeing all these
34:35 zoning problems that made no sense she
34:37 started seeing them DS owning the
34:40 streets and roads in Sonoma County where
34:43 she's from in Northern California just
34:46 insanity like taking 30s was it no 1,300
34:49 miles of roads and they d zone 1,200
34:52 miles of the roads I mean they're just
34:54 gonna let them right turn into like you
34:57 know gravel meaning all the businesses
35:00 on those roads are gonna go out of
35:01 business all the home values of anybody
35:04 on those roads gonna go down and because
35:07 it's gonna be rough to get there your
35:08 cars gonna need to be washed every
35:09 single day just go in and out of county
35:11 and you have to wash your car that's why
35:13 when you go to my hometown there are
35:15 cars that are just utterly filthy all
35:18 year round because the farmers are like
35:20 I'm gonna do spray it down with a hose
35:22 then drive home and then it's all dirty
35:24 spray it down at the at the ranch and
35:26 then it drives into town it's all dirty
35:28 so she in this presentation shows the
35:34 politicians in the room the construction
35:37 companies have been lobbied to include
35:41 agenda 21 structural engineering issues
35:44 meaning no zoned no one's allowed to
35:47 build out in the country
35:48 everything's only allowed to be built in
35:49 the city again Huntington Beach has been
35:53 slowly converting to agenda 21 and I
35:56 didn't realize it did make any sense
35:57 until I saw this presentation strip
36:01 malls are being replaced by these
36:03 buildings with some merchants down below
36:07 and then the apartment complex is up
36:09 above it's happening all over Orange
36:11 County so Orange County has got agenda21
36:15 all over even though during this
36:18 pandemic were one of the most rebellious
36:20 groups of people in the United States of
36:21 America second - especially Michigan so
36:28 the enemies would be the shills that
36:31 would let this happen the corporations
36:33 that take on agenda 21 documentation she
36:35 grabbed the construction brochure during
36:39 this 2012 presentation and opened it up
36:41 and inside were the diagrams that you
36:43 can find in the edge
36:44 21 website I mean they're not you know
36:47 its economy ecology and commerce
36:53 ecommerce or Commerce or something like
36:54 that but it was the three hemispheres of
36:57 their preaching so infiltration
37:01 there are mayors that have been
37:03 infiltrated there are senators and
37:05 governors and state representatives that
37:08 are all been commandeered and they're
37:12 all over your country they're all over
37:14 my country and so by literally going to
37:18 each one of these organizations and
37:20 downloading their spiel to us the
37:23 citizens and then looking at it and
37:25 saying wow does this match anything that
37:27 Rosa Cory has said in her presentations
37:30 when you see their symbology from Jena
37:33 21 inside the documentation game over
37:36 there's no more debate it's right there
37:39 so then if you get some Bulleit items in
37:44 place with agenda 21 whatever you think
37:47 your regions willing to listen to and
37:48 I'll tell you the one that's most
37:50 terrifying is the one you can't repeat
37:51 to normal citizens which is the
37:54 population reduction now you have a
37:57 sweet spot at this point for anyone
37:59 who's either recently red pill or
38:01 considers themselves deeply red pill
38:03 because what's strange is I look at you
38:08 know one of my trains is to look at
38:10 comments everywhere I go look at the
38:12 comments from TMZ leftist rags to news
38:15 organizations all around the world and
38:17 just see what people are saying from
38:18 Japan to Russia to Britain the United
38:21 States and no one ever mentions agenda21
38:27 I mean it is one in 10,000 comments
38:30 might suggest agenda21 but this needs to
38:33 be something that becomes in my opinion
38:35 a mantra that we talk all the time
38:39 because it is it so we have this low
38:45 level employee thing that we can do from
38:48 the bottom up getting rid of all of
38:51 their employees but at the same exact
38:53 time we need to start identifying those
38:56 at the top
38:58 now for those of you in Europe you have
39:00 actually an advantage over us us and
39:03 you're in America because as far as I
39:06 know I'm sure this does happen obviously
39:08 to have tens of thousands of folks on
39:11 board agenda 21 in America someone's
39:13 getting emails someone's having a
39:15 meeting someone's probably flying Europe
39:17 to get it briefed but in Europe its
39:19 above-ground supposedly there's a big
39:22 summit every 10 years and routine
39:24 meetings throughout the year as a part
39:26 of the EU so you know it's tough as an
39:31 American to know say a particular
39:33 politicians entire history right in
39:36 America we grew up with our politicians
39:38 we saw them go left and right then left
39:40 and whatever and so we know like when
39:43 someone says Pelosi we know her record
39:45 just admit automatically because we grew
39:47 up with her we heard the complaints
39:48 about her or something she did good or
39:51 something like that so you have that
39:52 base knowledge in your area and so you
39:56 can take your region we'll take our
39:58 region but the conversation is in my
40:01 opinion emphatic ly 21 now as you know
40:06 this is a bit of a repeat but this is
40:08 again getting us all on the same track
40:09 in my opinion in America in the state of
40:13 Georgia which for those of you not
40:15 familiar it's the southeast corner of
40:17 our country they've erected these what
40:20 they call Georgia Guidestones when I
40:23 show this to folks I get mixed responses
40:25 either get usually someone on board or
40:28 someone's like just I doesn't look like
40:30 anything to me their host and West world
40:32 they've been programmed not to see
40:33 anything it's a strangest thing but
40:35 again that first commandment says to
40:37 reduce world population under 500
40:39 million in perpetual balance of nature
40:41 someone has done an estimation of the
40:44 circumference of the earth and all the
40:46 land that we have and that's the number
40:47 they've come up with again I think
40:50 they're gonna be way underneath that if
40:51 they ever try to pull off that
40:53 depopulation it's important to realize
40:56 that number is not ninety six and a half
40:58 it's more like ninety nine someone built
41:03 this it's maintained people have
41:05 spray-painted supposedly people to try
41:08 to blow it up I try to pull it down and
41:10 destroy their trucks
41:11 so someone owns that someone has donated
41:15 money it's built in the early 80s so
41:17 it's almost 40 years old and someone has
41:20 deposited money or will keep upping the
41:23 ante there's a human being attached to
41:25 that you know my dream would be someone
41:28 who's inside the banking system of
41:30 Georgia someone in the politics of
41:33 Georgia in that particular County which
41:34 i think is uber ten or something to get
41:37 in there and find the records and figure
41:38 out who owns this place we need the name
41:41 I think again it'd be funny if someone
41:44 blew it to smithereens
41:45 and then stood there and got arrested
41:48 and said okay who's gonna charge me for
41:51 destroying this it can't be the county
41:53 the county doesn't own this whoever owns
41:56 these stones is gonna have to show their
41:58 face to prosecute me you know so that's
42:03 just a weird one it's just a really
42:05 really strange thing now could anybody
42:07 erect some weird thing like that and
42:10 then walk away and keep it going some
42:13 old farmer yes I guess that's true again
42:16 you know I'll give you an example of
42:19 something very interesting there was a
42:20 in Redondo Beach California apparently
42:25 an old guy who was a multi
42:27 multimillionaire died and he has his
42:30 wife and in his who got his money and he
42:33 put a kind of tongue-in-cheek
42:35 requirement for her to get the money
42:36 this is how the story was told to me so
42:38 it's a little bit embellished I'm just
42:41 passing it on but it it's funny he said
42:44 to have my money you have to shoot a
42:46 firework show in the Redondo Beach Coast
42:50 on a floating barge once a year on 4th
42:55 of July
42:55 take my money and pay for that and every
42:58 single year the wife has not let down
43:00 her husband and again I think it's just
43:03 tongue-in-cheek and I saw it I saw once
43:06 it was was amazing though Redondo has
43:08 their own show and then she has her show
43:10 and it was just a great experience so at
43:14 some point though you do run out of cash
43:16 to keep paying the land fees I mean
43:19 think you have to pay property tax right
43:21 because people have messed with it
43:25 it has to be repaired and cleaned up
43:26 they've also inserted a stone which was
43:28 removed then started a little stone
43:30 inside the top that I believe was 2015
43:32 as if something happened to 2015 this is
43:36 strange so the other organizations that
43:40 are obviously really bad underneath Jena
43:44 21 I won't even go into the World Health
43:46 Organization you guys all know about who
43:49 at this point but they're like Trump
43:52 said they're in bed with China because
43:54 China's money was destined the plane is
43:57 done now China's in massive trouble
43:59 right now but their investment was
44:01 supposed to save the EU who has
44:03 completely bankrupt all these legendary
44:05 countries I think it is a crime on
44:09 humanity these beautiful countries over
44:12 there
44:12 have lost their borders they've been
44:15 made insolvent and I mean if we lose
44:19 French culture German culture Spanish
44:21 culture Italian culture all the other
44:23 countries over there it's just it's a
44:27 war crime I mean it's just tend to mount
44:29 our tantamount I should say to going
44:33 over there and carpet bombing the whole
44:35 place what's the difference one is an
44:38 overnight experience it's all gone
44:40 everybody dead everybody you know
44:42 depopulated and then just doing it
44:44 slowly cooking the cook in the build
44:48 frog slowly and I can understand why
44:51 people at the beginning of the EU heard
44:54 about unification probably had their
44:58 list of things that they didn't like
44:59 about the fact that they were different
45:01 countries and different races and
45:02 blending together was you know had some
45:05 appeal but now were twenty years into it
45:08 and it's pretty apparent how bad the
45:13 employees are at actually making this
45:15 come true as it was sold right remember
45:19 most the scams in the world are sold
45:20 like a Robin Hood thing steal from the
45:22 rich give to the poor and that's just a
45:24 metaphor sometimes that's on point but
45:26 you know metaphorically speaking we're
45:28 going to fix everything as if it is
45:31 broken that was the that was the thing
45:33 that I think everybody in Europe needed
45:34 to realize was Europe broken in 1999
45:38 no every American wanted to visit Europe
45:44 now it's nobody does all right we're
45:47 looking for any other place to go
45:48 besides Europe and that's sad
45:51 and part of it is is that they have
45:53 memories of ever having been there in
45:55 the past and they don't want to have
45:56 their memories destroyed by governing
45:58 going over and finding out that the
46:00 cultures being diluted etc but they want
46:04 to escape they want to truly have a
46:06 non-confrontational world to be in and I
46:09 think that because they know that the
46:12 population has been duped like a good
46:15 percentage of them have been duped into
46:17 this they don't agree from here that's a
46:20 good idea
46:21 Brian getting rid of constitutional
46:22 rights and that kind of stuff and then
46:24 the second half is to see the population
46:30 itself you know incurring a lot of was a
46:35 Sharia law that kind of stuff almost a
46:37 Korea law that's pretty funny now until
46:41 my friend turned me on to Codex
46:42 Alimentarius we know that we knew that
46:49 in the 80s I say if you're 50 or above
46:54 we've known that food got really really
46:57 bad and I will just tell you from my own
46:59 experience what I thought was going on
47:01 was strictly a fast-food fetish
47:04 right fast-food mirrors the idea that
47:08 now we have to work 24/7 to bring home
47:11 the bacon just to live a medium life
47:14 right not even a good one
47:15 and so obviously fast food was the way
47:19 that we just drive through and make it
47:20 happen most of my friends who are obese
47:24 from fast food they have jobs where
47:27 they're like traveling nurses traveling
47:29 salesmen and you just can't afford to
47:31 sit down at a nice restaurant below 30
47:33 bucks on one meal and then you don't
47:36 know the area that's the other thing so
47:37 to sit there and look through Yelp and
47:39 try to find a restaurant that matches
47:42 your cuisine it has it has healthy
47:44 ingredients it just takes too long maybe
47:46 if you kept going through a town for ten
47:48 years you might find something maybe
47:50 third or fourth year if you're
47:51 aggressive
47:52 you talk to people in the local area you
47:55 find one that's got a $15.00 plate
47:57 that's made of fresh food fast food over
48:01 here gets its ingredients in America by
48:06 a company called Cisco starting with an
48:08 S that gets sys CEO that's the name of
48:12 it but that is your world trade trade
48:14 organization deep state vitamins and
48:17 minerals or toxins pesticides are good
48:19 for you at lethal levels that's the
48:22 organization now in my life just to give
48:25 you some case studies here I remember
48:29 when Taco Bell was its own private
48:30 company there was a Mexican restaurant
48:33 in the Bay Area called Chevy's Mexican
48:37 place right
48:38 it was also privately owned by a family
48:41 when I first moved to California I was
48:44 broke as a joke and so eating in fast
48:47 food places was the only way I could
48:50 survive go figure right I mean you could
48:54 technically say I could cook everything
48:55 but again when you cook it's tough to
48:58 cook for one all the time you know
48:59 cooking for two that's where you start
49:01 to get you know the amount of
49:02 ingredients that you bought from the
49:03 store the amount of meat you buy is
49:05 really suited for two people and that
49:08 kind of thing not everybody has a grill
49:09 to grill everything when you're living
49:11 in a one-bedroom apartment and some pole
49:14 somewhere or you're renting a room from
49:15 someone's house you just don't have
49:17 those amenities available to you you're
49:19 not supposed to use the kitchen that
49:20 much sort of thing right but I remember
49:23 when Taco Bell was its own thing before
49:25 it was bought by Pepsi and then I
49:27 remember getting bought by Pepsi I think
49:28 about an 88 or so it was amazing food
49:32 but then it turned into weird food and
49:36 today it is like not food in my opinion
49:38 that stuff tastes like fake food you eat
49:41 it and you get this gaggy weird ionized
49:44 flavor that doesn't taste right the the
49:47 big scandal that came out one of the
49:49 employees internally at the executive
49:50 level and one of their headquarters is
49:52 in Orange County came out and literally
49:54 said goes look were at best if you eat
49:57 one of our tacos you're eating 13% meat
50:00 and the other eighty seven percent is
50:03 filler like
50:05 liège and weird things have been ground
50:07 up and then seasoned it tastes like meat
50:10 no nutritional value whatsoever you know
50:13 it doesn't technically kill you but if
50:15 you're not eating nutrients your body
50:17 starts to deteriorate and then of course
50:19 if you a lot of fatty stuff it stores in
50:21 your body and that's what you get messed
50:23 up and then again someone gets addicted
50:24 to fast food we all have and you'll go
50:27 to that restaurant that you like seven
50:30 days a week I have a girlfriend of mine
50:34 that got addicted to the other Mexican
50:37 chain we have I hear which again in my
50:40 memory 2003 it was a privately owned
50:42 companies called del Taco it's a
50:44 Southern California thing and it was
50:47 amazing and then they got bought out and
50:49 then it was like the only thing that's
50:51 amazing about him today is that the
50:52 cheese is actually real cheese that's
50:54 the only thing that's different doesn't
50:56 have cheese with the Z which he was
50:59 eating there and like six times a week
51:01 at least and then she was getting lumps
51:03 in her breasts and then I finally
51:08 connected the dot for so but you do eat
51:10 that crappy food I know I know as what's
51:13 up D man I mean what do you think it's
51:14 like going to bed not knowing if it's a
51:17 cyst not knowing if it's cancer she
51:19 finally stopped eating it and lo and
51:21 behold those things dissolved away
51:23 amazing that's not medical proof there's
51:26 a cause and effect there but that was
51:28 the only thing she changed in her life
51:29 besides following my regimen of taking C
51:31 and b-17 Chevy's got taken over utterly
51:35 destroyed same thing so when a
51:40 restaurant becomes popular the United
51:42 States they get bought up by a major
51:43 corporation everybody wants their money
51:45 to run money and run right and then
51:47 Cisco takes over the ingredients
51:49 delivery because the franchise is so big
51:51 it's a tough job it's a tough job to
51:54 deliver meat to everyone Sonic
51:57 which was a it's a drivin hamburger
52:00 place like you know American Graffiti
52:04 like the old 50s root beer places right
52:07 when the best restaurants fast food
52:10 restaurants in the Midwest always fresh
52:13 ingredients always great a beef
52:15 awesome awesome awesome well they just
52:17 got to California and I was
52:18 he's thinking Jesus sucks that are not
52:20 out here as soon as I went to go buy
52:22 their food take one bite and you're like
52:24 oh my god this is not this is not food
52:27 anymore
52:28 whatever supply chain that they endorsed
52:31 to spread to California I'm assuming the
52:34 Midwest got co-opted as well it's crap
52:36 so the World Trade Organization is there
52:39 too
52:40 literally by charter kill every single
52:45 human being prior to when they would
52:47 normally be killed by fitting you
52:48 pesticides by demonizing vitamins and
52:51 minerals I mean how does that even
52:53 happen because I was a kid you were a
52:55 kid most of us when they were forming
52:58 this group and so how does that get you
53:04 know certified by a country without at
53:07 least adults paying attention to what's
53:09 going on and the reason why is that no
53:12 one has ever dared sabotage the food
53:16 supply of a particular country or region
53:18 of the world or multiple regions of the
53:20 world or the entire world no one's ever
53:21 tried to do that before no one's had the
53:23 ability to do it before Hitler would
53:26 have done it but he couldn't it was a
53:27 smaller world back in the day
53:29 who knows what world leaders would have
53:31 done that to the entire world have they
53:32 controlled the entire world the bummer
53:35 about most of our true enemies is this
53:40 they have one of two scenarios if
53:44 something serendipitously happens
53:46 meaning totally by chance where they are
53:48 allowed to then flex their influence and
53:51 destroy the quality of life they take
53:54 advantage of it instantaneously where
53:59 they don't have control but really
54:02 really really one control they do the
54:05 investor thing right which is a true
54:07 investor develops their opportunities
54:09 they don't wait for them to become
54:10 available and so they manufacture the
54:15 solution paying anyone whatever amount
54:19 of money they need to to get it done and
54:21 they get it done which is why our
54:23 enemies
54:29 I'll put it to you this way the cue
54:31 movement thing helps us with this little
54:35 definition because I think it's
54:37 misleading one of the things that the QA
54:40 guy says is these people are so stupid
54:44 making people think that these ruling
54:48 class people are so stupid the
54:51 distinction is this the employees at
54:54 best are the stupid people the people
54:57 that employ them are anything but stupid
55:01 anything but stupid by you accepting
55:05 this notion that your enemies are stupid
55:09 the problem with that algorithm is is
55:11 that you then start to underestimate
55:13 them you start to think that you can you
55:16 can relax a little bit because they're
55:18 so stupid well truth no matter is
55:21 someone should probably sit you down and
55:23 tell you just like the finale of the
55:26 movie Network where that the chubby guy
55:31 does this speech about how the world
55:33 really works and manages nails talks
55:35 about the petrodollar if someone set you
55:39 down looked you right in the face you
55:41 know and they were someone you could
55:42 totally respect they said look these
55:46 folks are utterly badass just like
55:49 Kennedy said in his speech he told you
55:52 that they're extremely organized that
55:54 they've infiltrated the entire world you
55:58 need to be told that these people are
55:59 beyond capable and I think it's really
56:04 interesting that someone would endorse
56:06 the notion that they will say that the
56:08 military for instance is because you're
56:12 playing out back that the military is
56:14 like fifty to a hundred years ahead of
56:16 everybody else you can't have that and
56:20 think that your enemies are stupid right
56:23 we think that you know there's all kinds
56:25 of tall tales about what the military
56:27 has anti-gravity all kinds of cures for
56:30 every disease they've got weapons that
56:32 will blow your mind and supposedly the
56:35 ruling class don't have access to the
56:37 same thing not only do they have access
56:39 to the same thing in my
56:42 deductions but they also control foreign
56:45 governments to use them on you
56:48 cops using drones to fly around and spy
56:51 on people in a town we think about that
56:54 that wasn't even the movie Blade Runner
56:56 which was you know Los Angeles 2019 it
57:00 came 20 years later in sci-fi shows
57:03 where why she 1985 with terminator right
57:08 they were flying all around the future
57:10 was a bunch of robots taking over the
57:11 world right now staking on the
57:16 overwhelming umbrella of agenda 21 and
57:19 their employees we now I think can
57:25 deduce quite successfully that they have
57:29 been doing this successfully for decades
57:31 which is why we have silly politicians
57:34 who are preaching mathematical
57:39 impossibilities as care packages for the
57:43 world right these ideas of these green
57:46 new deals were you know planes are gonna
57:49 be outlawed boats will be outlawed cars
57:51 will be outlawed all this stuff will be
57:52 outlawed and then you're still gonna
57:54 have you know healthcare program because
57:56 of the world trade organization
57:58 especially poisoning everyone everyone's
58:01 gonna end up in a hospital everyone will
58:03 end up in hospice all right some
58:05 Oncology Center getting your cure
58:07 sorry getting their cancer treatments
58:11 bleeding their finances dry that's what
58:14 it's all about you're an ATM right
58:17 everyone with a potential covet
58:19 diagnosis to a hospital they can't do
58:21 anything else but treat go vid people
58:23 well they're an ATM 1,300 bucks if I can
58:27 give you a test and say that you've got
58:28 it
58:29 I don't know sure boom everybody's got
58:31 it if you die of anything in the
58:34 hospital another thirty nine hundred
58:36 bucks that's almost five grant what's
58:40 over five grand just for false diagnosis
58:43 right now before we were aware of any of
58:48 this you know we know that corporatism
58:53 is a horrendous mechanism for Americans
58:58 we call it the Federal Reserve which is
59:00 now dot-gov I did verify that which is a
59:02 little bit mind-blowing but a private
59:05 for-profit bank is has been for you know
59:09 nearly well actually over a century now
59:12 107 years have controlled every dollar
59:15 printed in the United States coins are
59:17 still sovereign but dollar bills are
59:20 completely fiat fake based on nothing
59:24 which means they've got control over our
59:26 money that mechanism brought into
59:31 fruition the total control over how
59:35 investments are made in big corporations
59:37 and it also completely co-opted and
59:42 marginalized and destroyed the idea that
59:44 stocks are really something that we as
59:47 basic citizens can ever use to get
59:49 wealthy it happens every day people do
59:52 these quick things but think about how
59:55 because I've known a lot of day traders
59:57 in my life they sit at home with like
59:59 five monitors if not more in their home
60:02 watching trends mine and selling you
60:04 know little things here and there it's
60:06 that complicated to make a little bit of
60:09 money in the stock market instead of
60:11 just saying hey so-and-so's got a good
60:14 company I'm gonna put money into it
60:16 they're always making great products
60:18 there are a strategic resource for
60:19 everyone like car companies should even
60:22 though we we have so many now that it's
60:24 diluted should be able to make some type
60:28 of profit year over year we know that
60:31 like companies like GE big big companies
60:34 have been caught doing all kinds of
60:37 toxic dumps and all kinds of things and
60:40 now most of that has been outsourced to
60:43 other countries where the government's
60:44 are easily paid off citizens are getting
60:47 utterly poisoned and I don't quite know
60:50 the conversation that goes on to say but
60:58 this is an okay thing now one caution I
61:01 want to throw out there is that
61:05 during these times when we think we're
61:07 seeing an amazing scam going on in the
61:09 world some of our friends who are good
61:13 people who are incapable of imagining
61:15 conspiracies or negativity they get on
61:20 Facebook Twitter whatever and they just
61:22 support these agendas wear your mask
61:26 give up all your rights isn't it's gonna
61:28 be great that the world's gonna change
61:29 I've got some money in the bank so I
61:32 don't care about other people's
61:33 suffering until their money runs out you
61:37 know that statistic I saw today was the
61:39 estimate now that 30 million Americans
61:42 are unemployed now that's about 8% of
61:45 our population so we're way below the
61:48 depression which was 36% I believe was
61:51 the top level of unemployment but if
61:55 this occurs you know what the elite
61:58 understand about the world is that if
62:00 you're broke there's nothing you can do
62:03 roughly right you got basically the vote
62:06 voting power that you have but as if as
62:08 a part of the change that happens due to
62:12 this scam Demick is to do mail-in voting
62:15 where they're going to hijack the
62:18 ballots change them and then you don't
62:22 count them then your vote is worth
62:25 nothing you are completely a hundred
62:27 percent a victim of the system for the
62:29 rest of your life
62:30 the and I'm not sure this probably is
62:33 something where we should compare notes
62:34 in terms of voting
62:35 I do have an episode a long time ago
62:37 called voting fraud in the bilderbergs
62:39 if you just didn't a deep deep dive in
62:42 that definitely go see that old episode
62:44 just go to deep thoughts video com
62:45 search I'm voting but in America they
62:49 say that they are giving you a receipt
62:51 of your vote as proof and that's a
62:54 complete fraud so even the best
62:56 electronic machines what happens is you
62:59 got this absolutely atrocious interface
63:02 you know there's a wheel that you turn
63:03 it's just is this bad and then over to
63:06 the left there's a toilet paper roll
63:07 inside the system that is constantly
63:11 doing a you know dot matrix sort of heat
63:14 paper printout of what everyone's vote
63:17 was
63:18 giving supposedly this sense of security
63:20 that your votes being counted and that
63:23 you can verify it at a future time there
63:27 is no mechanism in the United States of
63:29 America that I am aware of with
63:30 electronic voting whereby you can take
63:33 the receipt with you that you could ever
63:36 go up to some accounting agency and say
63:40 I want to make sure that my vote was
63:41 counted properly and then you just say
63:43 I'm gonna give you my name my so sure
63:46 whatever and I want you to tell me what
63:48 I did I'm not gonna tell you what I
63:49 voted so you can repeat it back to me
63:51 there's no way to check your vote that
63:56 is where they've been throwing votes
63:57 like crazy forever where there is
64:02 massive population in the United States
64:04 there's massive voter fraud now there's
64:07 voter fraud everywhere because everybody
64:09 wants to get reelected because what a
64:10 cushy job that it's you know so the
64:13 state of New York and the state of
64:15 California are the most corrupt states
64:17 in the United States of America for
64:19 voter fraud what they do to keep people
64:24 believing that there isn't voter fraud
64:27 is twofold one they have been rolling
64:31 this scam out for years that every
64:33 presidential election we have is for the
64:35 last 20 years there's been a 50/50 split
64:38 oh my gosh you're your candidate just
64:41 lost by just a little tiny margin and so
64:43 you kind of go at least we put up a good
64:44 fight it's all fake the the odds of
64:49 having four presidential elections from
64:51 Bush to the end of Obama's era be damn
64:54 near 50/50 split is astronomically
64:56 impossible in the 80s you saw what
64:59 really happens when Ronald Reagan blew
65:02 Mondale out you know Ronald Reagan run
65:06 by won by landslides twice in a row red
65:09 is the Overlook Hotel man so the second
65:14 half of preparing your mind for the
65:16 50/50 split is you're listening to fake
65:18 news tell you what's going to occur you
65:21 listen to the polls which are all bought
65:23 and paid for to tell you what's going to
65:24 occur they're telling you right now in
65:26 America the President Trump is actually
65:28 tweeting about this but you don't need
65:30 President Trump to tell you
65:32 this is ridiculous it wouldn't matter
65:33 where you were in the world this is
65:36 still true we have a guy dying of
65:38 Alzheimer's running for president
65:41 Joe Biden they're trying to tell you
65:44 that Joe Biden is leading Trump at all
65:47 the swing states you know I have not
65:52 found more than a handful of people that
65:54 support this guy they don't necessarily
65:56 want their side to lose right they think
65:58 there's going to be a replacement
66:00 candidate which apparently there is
66:02 there's talk about Hillary trying to
66:04 push herself in again which would be
66:05 utterly laughable if Hillary was
66:09 unpopular at say if we took her
66:12 unpopularity when when Trump ran as a
66:15 zero point right this is how unpopular
66:17 you are she's in the negatives now like
66:19 crazy because of the red peeling that's
66:20 gone on for this last three and a half
66:22 years by the time you Lyceum comes no
66:25 way in hell unless they get this mail-in
66:28 voting ballot but again those that
66:32 control the world never ever ever stop
66:34 what they're doing as long as they're
66:37 allowed to have their money their
66:40 hiding-places they're going to continue
66:43 pushing and pushing and you and I will
66:45 continue having to fight that war now if
66:49 you what I like to do at times is to
66:51 take the world which is now smaller and
66:53 smaller do the internet and
66:55 communication and reduce it to a village
66:59 if you had a saboteur inside your
67:02 village and it's being defined strictly
67:04 as why is the grainery constantly being
67:08 set on fire why why the Bulls would find
67:12 them killed in the middle of the night
67:13 you know the next morning we find they
67:15 were killed in an overnight something
67:17 negative is happening constantly we
67:20 would start looking for the saboteur we
67:23 would put guards out to watch we'd find
67:26 out everybody's alibi where were you
67:28 when this happened hey everybody let's
67:31 you know for the next six months let's
67:33 keep track of everybody you just keep
67:34 track of your family members we're not
67:36 gonna survey you necessarily but
67:37 everybody needs to know what's what's
67:39 going on we would find The Saboteur and
67:43 do whatever justice we thought was
67:46 but they be taken out of the population
67:49 in order to stop the carnage if you do a
67:54 little bit of advance thinking you know
67:57 that other than a poor person that could
68:00 run out and maybe set a fire kill a bull
68:03 something like that what we're dealing
68:05 with today requires tremendous amounts
68:08 of money and investment so George Soros
68:11 for instance is a provocateur
68:15 he's a saboteur he's a treasonous to
68:18 human being against all of humanity the
68:22 only thing that would get you to be
68:23 friends with George Soros or for him to
68:25 think of you as a friend is if you
68:26 advance one of his agendas and hurt
68:28 people that's all he cares about
68:31 we now have Bill Gates running around
68:33 vaccination vaccinations microchipping
68:36 everyone tattooing everyone he is again
68:40 I was reviewing some statistics and I
68:43 was looking at the one or 47 thousand
68:45 people in India can polio from his polio
68:48 vaccination and another friend of mine
68:50 sent me an article that was ten times
68:53 that amount in Africa based on Gates
68:56 Foundation paid for and subsidized
68:58 vaccinations other people are involved
69:00 in it but he's got the worst track
69:02 record on planet Earth if you were to
69:04 ever read the results of his vaccination
69:06 programs overseas you would never let
69:09 him touch you or your kids just like
69:12 letting vlad the impaler babysit your
69:14 children why would you ever do that you
69:16 know his record why would you ever do
69:18 that why are we having such a hard time
69:20 connecting dots when in history you
69:24 might hear rumors of up lad the Impaler
69:26 but unless you were a soldier that
69:27 walked up to his palace and saw the
69:29 heads on spikes you wouldn't have any
69:31 proof that it was real and today we've
69:34 got statistics we've got documentaries
69:36 we've got people testifying so we have
69:38 proof these folks don't wish us any good
69:42 and the fact that they're free I think
69:46 starts to shine on the quick hue
69:48 movement in a very negative way the
69:51 catalyst to this information in my
69:54 opinion is that we have a chance right
69:55 now like I said my other episode herding
69:58 the herd mentality
69:59 we have a chance to make things better
70:02 if we sit on our hands then we have
70:06 their chance now today our main weapon
70:11 is communication the best level of
70:14 communication you can do is in your
70:15 local area because you know people you
70:18 know about them right you know how to
70:21 talk to them you know what they're
70:22 capable of believing and not believing
70:24 and it doesn't mean you should probably
70:26 talk to people that are never going to
70:27 believe you you know maybe they're never
70:30 going to be a part of the solution this
70:32 will be your gift to them if you can
70:34 convince the rest of the population that
70:36 will take the information and advance
70:38 change you know popularity is pretty
70:42 much how everything works in this world
70:44 never forget that so when they make
70:46 vaccinations popular then you have to
70:49 take them you don't make them unpopular
70:52 then most people go no way man I mean I
70:54 don't mind if you take them that's your
70:56 thing take an extra helping if you can
70:58 but I don't want it for myself now
71:02 because corporations are part of that
71:07 money-making organization right so you
71:10 could be a particular airline so I won't
71:13 mention anyone because this is all
71:14 hypothetical and let's say that this
71:19 isn't true they're all controlled by
71:20 these big investment banking houses
71:22 right remember money is created and then
71:26 through a process it makes it into the
71:30 hands of those who control the money
71:31 which is usually an investment banking
71:33 house then they disseminate it to their
71:35 allies of whatever agenda is going on
71:39 which in this case is 21 well we were
71:43 told 20 years ago that their goal was to
71:46 check us all at the state line right you
71:49 know you can't show me your papers just
71:50 what they want they want that Nazi
71:52 Germany thing to happen all over the
71:53 world so they want you to inherently
71:57 demonize traveling because you fear
71:59 catching something okay and then what
72:04 they can do is take all airlines and say
72:08 okay you have just incurred up to a 65%
72:12 or more loss and you're
72:14 if you want to bail out you're gonna
72:17 have to agree to a vaccination related
72:22 regiment in order to let someone on one
72:25 of your planes imagine that if they
72:28 travel by car
72:29 everywhere you go because of bus a train
72:32 any form of mass communications that
72:35 excuse me we'll have this draconian
72:38 check your temperature give you a test
72:42 you have to have the tattoo on your arm
72:44 just say that you were vaccinated
72:46 against whatever the latest scare is the
72:50 thing that they know is that if you
72:53 concede one time the likelihood that you
72:56 will concede for the rest of your life
72:57 is almost a certainty because you're
73:00 weak-minded now there's a lot of folks
73:03 that used to take vaccinations like flu
73:07 vaccinations I have a couple of friends
73:11 of mine that took it got sick as a dog
73:14 lost a week worth of work literally
73:16 thought they were gonna die because of
73:18 the vaccination because the flu they got
73:20 was so aggressive it was terrifying way
73:23 beyond anything they've ever had in
73:24 their life and so they use that moment
73:27 to swear off any vaccinations in the
73:29 future so that happens but unfortunately
73:32 it doesn't happen enough and it's
73:33 unfortunate that anyone has to get
73:35 harmed physically one because of
73:38 aluminum and Mercury they get harmed
73:40 forever but two that they ever had to go
73:42 through this thus abomination to wake up
73:46 but imagine that imagine they all within
73:49 12 months of right now late April 2020
73:54 all the corporations do this thing gotta
73:59 check yourself out gotta be back to the
74:00 LSO and you choose not to do it well you
74:04 might say okay well I'll never go to
74:06 Hawaii again unfortunately I'll never go
74:08 to Europe ever because the boats will
74:11 also be commandeered this way and you
74:15 know even if the boats said we're not
74:16 gonna do this if the airports or the
74:19 docks say you have to then it's just the
74:21 same thing you might go okay most I'll
74:24 go home and I'll Drive home to the
74:25 Midwest takes two days to get there
74:27 it's a process puts a bunch of miles on
74:29 my car but at least I can get there you
74:32 know semi-annually or whatever alright
74:37 now your bank says we can't let you have
74:42 your money we can't let you take out
74:44 your money unless you've got this
74:46 vaccination restaurant chains you can't
74:51 serve your food unless you've got it
74:52 grocery stores we can't even sell you
74:55 food unless you've got it it shouldn't
74:59 sound crazy to you at this point that
75:01 that could become immediately a reality
75:04 in our world and so obviously the only
75:09 thing that keeps them from trying to
75:11 push that agenda forward is the
75:12 resistance of the people and their
75:14 knowledge that we would resist if you
75:18 know try to cut off food from people
75:19 there'd be a raid on every grocery store
75:23 on planet earth they'd knock in all the
75:24 windows and going and just steal the
75:26 food they don't even pay for it not
75:28 enough police to go and get all the food
75:30 that's why rice always get away with
75:32 everything right yeah if you ever watch
75:35 that Netflix special on the hip-hop
75:38 industry of the late seventies early
75:41 eighties apparently we have a lot of
75:45 DJ's now that are famous that thankfully
75:49 have brought us a lot of great music
75:50 because of the blackouts in New York we
75:53 have they had a huge black out the in
75:58 New York they raided the place a bunch
76:00 of people wouldn't sold speakers and
76:01 turntables and mixers and then they got
76:03 the career started it's very interesting
76:06 but how do they take our temperature for
76:10 how they figure out what we're willing
76:11 to do I'll tell you most of you know
76:15 this answer accurately in a knee-jerk
76:16 response social media social media
76:20 social media even an article with links
76:23 or with comments down below is still
76:25 social social media so they watch your
76:28 posts they harvest your posts with fake
76:32 accounts right you get an account and
76:34 someone from India you know with like
76:37 four pictures on their page
76:40 you but you've got your page fairly
76:42 private whatever service you're using as
76:45 soon as they're in on your thing they
76:47 can see what you're doing but the other
76:49 thing is the corporations themselves are
76:51 doing it without any infiltration so
76:53 they keep a temperature well it looks
76:56 like everyone believes the hillary can
76:58 win okay well then we will totally throw
77:00 the vote and everyone the majority will
77:02 believe it oh sure people will be upset
77:04 but then we'll just throw it in their
77:05 face that we were upset when Trump made
77:07 it boom the Antichrist becomes president
77:13 sometimes they will gamble they'll
77:16 simply say you have no choice sorry you
77:19 don't need to really fly anywhere do you
77:21 you know at some point if they ever did
77:24 the flight restrictions based on
77:25 vaccinations someone's going to be
77:27 trapped in a country that they're not
77:28 from it's going to turn on they don't
77:31 want the shot and there's no way to get
77:33 home this is the most informed example
77:43 that we have ever had in world history
77:44 that this is going on it really
77:48 disappoints me when grown adults cop
77:52 that attitude that oh I don't be a
77:54 conspiracy theory person really so I
77:59 just let it go
78:00 you know hell in a handbasket one of the
78:03 biggest things that tells me someone's
78:05 totally asleep as if they say and you
78:08 know I have to preface this with Rosa
78:14 Corey does say this up to a point but
78:18 she's got a much more aggressive agenda
78:19 someone who says write your senator
78:22 because they want to be re-elected what
78:27 is it the woman for kotas I Codex
78:31 Alimentarius says the same thing there's
78:34 an older generation that really believes
78:36 that works now the truth of matter is is
78:40 that
78:42 if it were to be in total mass then
78:47 maybe but I guarantee you the only word
78:51 that's going to be used at the elite
78:52 level is the word postponed again our
78:57 goal as humans on this planet if you
79:01 believe that humans are made equal and
79:02 that you've got rights simply because
79:04 you exist which all of you should
79:07 believe that were equal in different
79:10 ways of course we have to target those
79:15 at the tippy tippy top
79:19 Saros has 179 corporations that we know
79:22 of probably has a lot more we don't know
79:25 of funding at all to destroy the world
79:28 finding it all to take away your vote
79:30 the guy owns a bunch of voting machines
79:33 in America that should be illegal right
79:37 this idea that your guilt tripped into
79:40 being a melting pot to the extent you
79:42 sell your land to a foreign citizen is
79:45 insane hey come over here be a citizen
79:48 if I go over to Germany and I become a
79:50 citizen of Germany I'll learn how to
79:52 speak the language and get along with
79:53 the culture endorsing their coats are
79:55 not making them endorsed mine then shirt
79:58 me buying German land - then plot myself
80:01 there for the rest of my life makes
80:02 complete sense someone from China coming
80:04 here and becoming in a citizen and being
80:06 a good upstanding taxpayer whatever
80:08 through their corporation after their
80:11 personal taxes fine you're an American
80:15 now welcome but we're allowing China to
80:19 buy up the entire world and they're
80:22 still in China pure insanity you can't
80:25 do it in China
80:26 but they can do it to you and they're
80:27 just playing us there's like you're so
80:29 stupid that you allow foreign company or
80:32 foreign countries excuse me to buy your
80:33 land [ __ ] we're just gonna take you over
80:35 I hope you like everything that we like
80:38 because eventually you'll be squeezed
80:40 out of your own population we're not
80:43 talking about racism here we're talking
80:44 about an even fair playing field if you
80:50 were I mean I used to give this analogy
80:53 a lot I'm gonna give it to you one more
80:55 time
80:55 it's been several dozens of episodes
80:58 since I gave you this analogy maybe even
81:00 a 100 episodes ago in my 20s I finally
81:05 figured out why you're supported my 30s
81:08 to be honest the analogy was you're at
81:11 like some corridor of like a hospital
81:13 it's a long corridor and on both sides
81:16 left and right you've got doors that are
81:19 opposite each other it's like doors
81:21 doors doors and the india of the ER room
81:23 with the Baine doors right what you were
81:26 taught as you walk down the hall of
81:29 blame and causality is that there's if
81:33 you're a right winger you blame the left
81:35 door if you're a left winger you blame
81:38 the right door
81:38 now before Trump this analogy was very
81:41 powerful because we know that both these
81:43 parties were in it together still very
81:46 much the same today but there is a
81:48 little bit of resistance in America this
81:50 is good the next roll up is corporatism
81:57 you blame corporations for everything
81:59 that's bad now you can insert whatever
82:03 you want into the doors but what you're
82:06 doing is you're blaming their employees
82:07 and if you stop and you got rid of both
82:10 the left and the right that's possible
82:13 you mean one party they're still gonna
82:15 be employees of the folks that are
82:17 straight down the hallway what you have
82:20 to do in your brain is ignore all of
82:23 those doors they're gonna be yelling at
82:25 you saying things that infuriates you
82:28 doing things that infuriate you you
82:30 gotta ignore it all you get down to that
82:31 door punched at the door
82:34 and The Wizard of Oz is behind that last
82:36 door he is the metaphor the people who
82:39 control you so imagine you know someone
82:43 hates Pelosi or whatever Merkel or
82:48 Makran or whatever these are just
82:50 employees and the doors to the last door
82:52 that you need you have to go for their
82:55 owners just like George Carlin said you
82:58 were owned there owned because we allow
83:01 that metaphor in our brain to become
83:05 true obviously nobody endorses slavery
83:10 so being owned is a form of slavery when
83:14 Prince changed his name to an
83:16 unspeakable symbol and Road slave on the
83:17 side of his face he was trying to tell
83:20 you that in the music industry he was
83:22 owned by Warner Brothers couldn't
83:24 determine what track would be the number
83:26 one track on the radio I think they did
83:29 a fairly decent job with his catalog but
83:30 a bunch of his stuff never released and
83:33 now that he's passed away his sister's
83:34 putting him out every week we have our
83:39 people in this world that are kind of
83:42 semi owners right our Rockefellers are
83:44 still owned they're owned by the
83:45 Rothschilds but there are plenty people
83:48 at the Rothschild level at the royalty
83:50 level that own you and the big indicator
83:54 of the true big owners is that in your
83:57 country if there's any citizens of your
83:59 country that are prohibited by law to
84:03 never be charged with the crime
84:04 ever now we don't allow for instance the
84:08 president United States to be charged
84:10 while he's in office because that's
84:11 disruptive to the country but the second
84:13 president Trump exits presidency if he
84:16 truly committed a crime you could go
84:18 after the guy no they usually don't
84:19 allow that because again it's the part
84:21 of the legacy and the embarrassment of
84:23 country or whatever but there are people
84:25 around the world that can't be charged
84:29 now that's one group of people that own
84:31 us the second I mean I don't mean to say
84:34 that is if it's true that's what they
84:36 think about us right the other group of
84:40 people have done it even more
84:41 brilliantly than those that can't be
84:44 charged I'll let you do swen I'm talking
84:47 about here for those of you saw the
84:50 movie on your usual suspects I will said
84:53 unusual suspects it could be a sequel
84:55 right there was the character Keyser so
84:58 say that Kevin Spacey's character
85:00 invented in the precinct a phantom
85:05 character that doesn't exist so the
85:08 police would be trying to chase
85:09 something that doesn't exist you have
85:12 this happening all around the world
85:14 they're pointing the fingers at people
85:16 that are above ground so to speak but
85:20 there are plenty of gigantic estates in
85:23 the world
85:23 and you wonder how they can pay the
85:25 bills it's because every single time a
85:30 barrel of oil comes out of the ground
85:31 they make money they have done such a
85:35 good job hiding themselves in the world
85:37 that if you try to search on them on the
85:39 internet you'll find nothing but maybe
85:41 conspiracy I remember back in the
85:46 between 2005 and 2010 when I first
85:49 started lying about the Rothschilds you
85:51 would go to Google and search on them or
85:53 Yahoo or MSN or whatever and you barely
85:57 got any photographs these people it was
86:00 as if someone said you're not allowed to
86:02 see them or pictures not even allowed to
86:03 be posted on the Internet of them and
86:05 pictures aren't even taken of them who
86:07 would who would have access to them to
86:08 take pictures and finally I found a few
86:10 folks but it's just a few folks now the
86:15 Rothschilds again because of the hubris
86:16 and 1800's talked a lot about their
86:19 power and all this other stuff so they
86:21 expose themselves but they weren't the
86:24 only ones
86:26 can you imagine I'm just going to give
86:28 you a hypothetical did you imagine that
86:30 there are no such things as Rothschilds
86:33 did anybody with that last name is just
86:35 incidentally has that last name and we
86:38 know that's not true but imagine you
86:42 just unable to identify and the only
86:44 thing you could possibly do is look
86:46 around your local neighborhood and
86:47 especially like in America we don't have
86:50 that many super mansions we've got you
86:53 know some places in Hollywood and
86:54 Brentwood we've got some places
86:56 Louisiana from the old plantation owners
86:58 yeah maybe they own one of those places
87:01 but it's not where they would live and
87:03 Rhode Island we have some pretty big
87:05 estates up there right so in Europe
87:09 though you've got Batman level mansions
87:15 I mean Downton Abbey type mansions that
87:18 are still active they're not public
87:19 exhibits for the world to see that may
87:23 be a way but what if they just live in
87:26 modest places nice places way beyond our
87:29 capability of paying for but not beyond
87:32 maybe Tim Cook buying the same kind of
87:34 place or Larry Ellison or some
87:37 he's really rich Bill Gates or somebody
87:39 right it's debatable as to what the plan
87:43 might be to scoop these people out of
87:46 the planet typically because we don't
87:49 want to turn into a mob we want to
87:51 prosecute them with crimes and that
87:54 requires evidence remember how long they
87:56 chased out Al Capone finally got him on
88:00 tax evasion hmm maybe it's a formula
88:03 like that find out who these people are
88:05 fund if they've ever paid taxes to their
88:07 country I assume they don't definitely
88:11 there's a mandatory vaccination they're
88:12 definitely not taking it or if they did
88:15 they would take a completely clean one I
88:18 think it's a sobering statement to a red
88:21 pillar to say do you really know your
88:24 enemies I mean do you really know your
88:27 enemies I know you know their employees
88:28 I know you know that we lost most of all
88:31 of us know their employees do we really
88:33 know the top dogs because without them
88:36 being apprehended and disabled you know
88:41 it's a problem now one of the benefits
88:43 we might have it's a two tiered system
88:46 here but you could probably shut down
88:49 their power structure by simply
88:51 reprinting the money to be gold backed
88:53 and out of their grasp the other thing
88:56 is because their wealth is typically
88:58 very digital maybe you go and digitally
89:01 erase them then they have no money but
89:04 maybe they have a stockpile of gold
89:06 we definitely have mansions and assets
89:08 they could liquidate to do whatever they
89:10 need to do but if you were to say okay
89:12 there's a particular person who's one of
89:15 the bad guys and they've got ten billion
89:18 dollars in assets between land and
89:20 property and investments or whatever but
89:24 with the way that they control the
89:25 planet is with trillions of dollars that
89:27 are gotten through opium sells opioid
89:31 sells various drugs of certain kind and
89:35 knocking that out is a way to disable
89:37 the-- but as long as they gank the
89:40 economy people resort to drugs to get
89:42 along there's all these reports in
89:45 America alcoholism has gone to the roof
89:46 during this pandemic
89:50 scam that we're living in so let me know
89:54 what you think about this entire subject
89:57 matter and if I missed any arteries of
90:01 control that you're aware of please
90:03 share it
90:04 Lincoln's videos articles whatever
