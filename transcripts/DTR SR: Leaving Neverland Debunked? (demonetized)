00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts hmm you didn't think I was
00:40 gonna let Michael go undefended did you
00:45 tonight is our follow up special report
00:48 to go through some of the massive
00:51 inconsistencies with leaving Neverland
00:55 now when I first watched this episode
00:57 this two-part four-hour HBO special I
01:05 [Music]
01:06 had never heard of these accusations
01:08 like I heard in this show I didn't know
01:12 who Wade was I didn't know Wade Robson
01:14 and James safe Chuck I'd know anything
01:17 about these two dudes didn't know they
01:19 existed I got two hoods on gonna have to
01:23 straighten this out I'm gonna look like
01:24 the Hunchback of Notre Dom now this
01:28 thing had just come out well not
01:29 recorded this and then of course I had
01:30 to sit on it for like two weeks before I
01:32 pushed it out the door
01:33 and so I'm definitely getting some some
01:37 very angry listeners only a couple
01:46 couple seemed like they listened to like
01:49 five minutes of it and he chimed out and
01:52 they bled all over my page and of course
01:59 they didn't listen to it so they sound
02:00 like morons just a couple of them but a
02:04 lot of really nice people coming in
02:07 disagreeing but that really did it in a
02:09 beautiful way and they offered videos
02:11 and they offered sources they just wrote
02:13 paragraphs with beautiful facts and so
02:17 to every single one of you who did that
02:22 thank you
02:24 you're a deep thoughts radio listener
02:28 you'd be absolutely the top-quality
02:30 human being that we seek to join this
02:34 movement for all the subjects not just
02:36 Michael Jackson so please feel welcome
02:39 I appreciate it I look forward to your
02:41 mind looking into all the episodes that
02:44 have nothing to do with Michael Jackson
02:45 and nothing to do with these acidic
02:48 subjects there's a few out there but for
02:52 the most part you should feel nice and
02:55 comfortable hopefully
02:57 pardon my read it in mouth every once in
03:00 a while I try to tone that back just a
03:02 little bit I tried telling that back for
03:05 two reasons one for the listeners who
03:08 have kindly asked me do you really got
03:10 accustomed much it probably will be a
03:12 couple in every episode but man I listen
03:15 to an episode the other day there's
03:16 there's going to be a new well there is
03:18 a new episode on the patreon only page I
03:21 tried to do a matrix part two and I did
03:25 it and it has some pretty cool turns in
03:27 it but the first half of the video I
03:30 don't know what it was I was feeling
03:31 really just bouncy with my mouth and so
03:35 it's up there as a patreon only episode
03:37 it will never see the light of day
03:40 Michael Jackson Neverland leaving
03:45 Neverland now in case you're just under
03:49 a rock living in a barn don't care but
03:54 you bump into this episode you're like
03:55 hey man I'm it's 4:00 in the morning I
03:57 can't get to sleep I'm just gonna watch
03:58 this video because I randomly found it
04:00 this is about the HBO two-part series
04:06 part 1 part 2 each two hours long were
04:09 two gentlemen accuse Michael Jackson 20
04:13 years after the fact 25 years after the
04:15 fact of being a child molester
04:19 they claim that man Michael was busy and
04:25 I guess I can say safely now
04:29 unfortunately for them
04:32 the anons of the world that Q would call
04:35 a nun's they now have dug into this the
04:38 attorneys have shown back up a bunch of
04:41 people that were in the court cases have
04:43 shown up and said there's a bunch of in
04:45 consistencies here and the documentary
04:47 was made to favor obviously these two
04:52 individuals to create a buzz
04:53 to create more subscriptions to HBO and
04:58 they created a very compelling thing but
05:02 it might just be fiction again inlaid
05:06 with truth if you knew somebody and you
05:10 hung out with them 30 years ago I guess
05:14 you could say anything after they're
05:16 dead especially they're not alive to
05:18 defend themselves but it's just your
05:21 word against a dead guy's word and then
05:24 if you can get one other guy to go with
05:25 you because you're both having super
05:28 financial problems they man you have a
05:32 something that's sort of unique we don't
05:35 get that all the time we get people
05:37 talking about dead people all the time
05:38 but we don't always get uh none
05:44 cooperated evidence free accusation
05:48 against an individual Michael Louis said
05:52 you know you're innocent until you're
05:57 proven guilty and he never realized how
06:01 important that methodology that we have
06:04 created in the United States of America
06:06 is until he was accused he was sued all
06:11 the time for all kinds of different
06:12 things because in accusations free
06:14 attorneys who think they're gonna extort
06:16 money out of somebody's rich the
06:21 partners of a law firm will simply get
06:22 together I just do the math and go well
06:25 he's got tons of money let's go after
06:27 him all right
06:29 hey we got like a 40% chance of winning
06:31 but Jesus if we win 40% the law firm
06:34 makes a million two million three
06:35 million whatever it is 50 percent maybe
06:37 even ten million
06:38 those are pretty decent odds unless you
06:42 fail when I went out and did the the
06:46 debunking research there was so much so
06:54 much evidence against it but I want to
06:56 share with you first something that
06:57 happened in my personal circles and it
07:02 was actually kind of funny
07:04 I will tell you if you ever wanna get in
07:07 competition with me and I'm aware of
07:09 this probably one of the areas you don't
07:12 want to get in a competition with me and
07:14 unless you're autistic unless you make
07:16 this part of your exhibition profession
07:20 it's to casually get in a memory war
07:22 with me telling me that something was
07:25 one way that you perceived it as one way
07:31 when I perceived it as a different
07:33 methodology what am I talking about
07:36 when I watch this documentary I was
07:38 paying such specific attention to what I
07:44 was watching it was utterly painful both
07:47 these guys talk so goddamn slow they
07:51 make [ __ ] William Shatner look like a
07:54 speed talker from those FedEx
07:56 commercials back in the day so carefully
07:59 preparing every single word never a
08:03 continuous shot for any length of time
08:04 cut cut cut cut cut it so if they're
08:07 stitching it together it's just like say
08:08 every word in the dictionary and the
08:10 producers will simply figure out how to
08:12 stitch it together to make you say
08:14 whatever we think you should say but I
08:18 had a close friend of mine who's
08:19 brilliant I respect greatly but this
08:22 person tried to well she just basically
08:28 remembered things very different than me
08:31 and it was two things that I was
08:37 criticizing the documentary for one was
08:41 the maid that came out and said Michael
08:44 Jackson had been showering with the boy
08:47 and when I first heard it in the 90s she
08:49 said that she saw Michael performing
08:52 more a section on a boy in a shower
08:54 did she change his story then she got
08:57 busted for lying and then they looked up
08:59 her background and she's got a whole
09:00 [ __ ] lifestyle of telling lies and
09:04 manipulating facts to extort money out
09:06 of situations she's one of those people
09:10 all right and the other thing was that I
09:14 watched the whole thing through because
09:16 I wanted to know if these two guys
09:17 each other now today they really really
09:20 really know each other and how I have
09:22 reason to believe they really know each
09:25 other and they've really planned this
09:27 thing out we're gonna get to both sides
09:30 of the argument a little bit but in the
09:34 documentary the only evidence that these
09:37 people even knew of each other was that
09:40 when James saw Wade's 2013 interview I
09:44 believe the guy's been thrown out of
09:47 television he said that he took the
09:50 video or recorded the video in some way
09:53 and showed his wife and said this is
09:55 what happened to me that is the only
09:57 time they ever mentioned crossbreeding
10:00 with each other in fact I don't remember
10:01 Wade ever mentioning James at all but my
10:06 friend remembered my god they're bosom
10:09 buddies and they knew each other and it
10:10 was completely disclosed in the
10:11 documentary so I was like god damn it I
10:16 know I'm [ __ ] right I know I'm right
10:19 apparently this episode is gonna have
10:20 dirty words so I rewatched the last hour
10:25 and a half of the second episode to
10:28 rewind when the accusation started
10:30 coming out when they started flipping
10:32 their testimonies to say he was touching
10:34 them the maid was represented in the
10:38 documentary by cutting in a news clip
10:41 that went on TV at no point and the
10:47 second half at least did they stop that
10:49 news clip and say oh but this chick had
10:51 to admit she was perjuring herself on a
10:54 court of law
10:55 they never went through her background
10:59 and then again washed all the way to the
11:01 end to see if they ever mentioned each
11:03 other only genes mentioned seeing Wade's
11:05 testimony on TV and he used that as a
11:08 sort of a backhanded way of saying I'm
11:11 not gonna tell you what he did to me but
11:13 if you watch what Wade said that's what
11:14 he did to me okay so I was right but
11:21 isn't interesting how when someone has
11:24 someone believes that this is true they
11:28 remember it the way they want to
11:30 remember it
11:31 I just wanted the truth I mean for me it
11:35 was like okay I'm gonna start off with
11:38 the thing that looks suspect to me the
11:42 really the only thing that could be
11:45 visual evidence to indicate that
11:47 something was a little strange between
11:49 Michael and these kids but I wasn't
11:54 there I don't know what tints that these
11:57 moments were done but it's the holding
12:00 hand thing
12:00 it seems innocent enough but then it
12:03 seems a little kooky if someone is
12:06 merely trying to relive their childhood
12:10 then I think Michael Jackson's smart
12:12 enough to look around at other children
12:14 especially all the kids he hangs out
12:15 with I mean he was surrounded by I would
12:19 say if you said how many little kids
12:20 were within 50 feet a 50 foot radius
12:24 around Michael individually individual
12:27 souls that had been around him his
12:29 entire life how many do you think 10
12:33 million kids had walked in a 50 50 foot
12:37 circle of him
12:38 not counting not not counting the
12:40 concerts at all none of those kids are
12:43 sitting around holding hands little boys
12:46 don't sit around holding hands I never
12:47 held hands as my little friends only
12:50 when they you know maybe you're praying
12:52 it's some dinner or you're playing some
12:55 game where you're trying to block people
12:57 Red Rover
12:59 which I hated that game that's the only
13:04 thing that's a little weird I mean
13:06 seriously
13:06 sleeping over falling asleep in the same
13:09 bed I can find a hundred rationales in
13:11 my head for that I really can't that's
13:13 what we did do when I was a kid
13:16 guys were spending out of my house I
13:18 didn't like drag out a new bed for my
13:20 friend he was like yeah you sleep when I
13:21 was like I bet I'll sleep on this side
13:22 of bed that was it so I watched a few
13:29 videos that you guys suggested very
13:33 interesting videos took some notes I'm
13:37 gonna go through them here now we have
13:41 to say as
13:44 defending the situation potentially the
13:48 people who simply don't want to believe
13:50 and they can well they can beautifully
13:53 articulate how they don't believe and
13:55 why they wouldn't believe such a thing
13:57 that's good that they feel that way but
14:00 that's not evidence
14:01 that's just your feeling so as much as
14:05 you might feel that he's innocent
14:09 because these guys are making
14:11 accusations and again if Michaels
14:12 innocent it's it's bad it's gonna be bad
14:20 for those people there's a few moments
14:24 in time where I look at people's
14:26 behavior like Joe Biden being a
14:28 pedophile and I say this is a man who
14:34 doesn't believe in God
14:36 and if he's ever gonna pray to anything
14:40 he needs to pray that there is no God
14:43 he needs to bank on the fact that as
14:46 soon as he dies that all his little girl
14:50 breasts touching all of his rubbing his
14:53 junk against little girls or even
14:55 teenage girls while there he's swearing
14:58 in their parents all those little tricks
15:01 that he thinks he got away with on
15:03 camera on HD cameras
15:05 he needs to pray everyday that there's
15:08 no God anyone defending him needs to
15:10 pray there's no God I Got News for you
15:15 there's an afterlife then there are
15:18 consequences I've been there I've been
15:21 on the edge and man it is so beyond your
15:26 comprehension the afterlife and how
15:30 quickly you will lose everything you
15:33 will lose all the privilege of being in
15:35 a unique individual
15:36 you will lose I mean a prison cell would
15:39 seem like you're the richest man on
15:41 earth when you cross the other side and
15:44 you've done some nasty [ __ ] in this
15:45 world I don't think it's forever and
15:49 like a finite crime yields of in
15:51 eternity and some sort of hell I don't
15:54 believe in fire and brimstone in that
15:55 crap
15:56 but you don't need that you just put you
15:59 alone in the universe with nothing with
16:02 no one and you just enjoyed maybe you're
16:08 cold but you will have no interaction
16:12 with anything your senses that used to
16:16 be your body will be void you'll be
16:19 floating into nothingness and enjoy your
16:21 time until such time as your creator or
16:25 those who own the universe think you've
16:27 learned your lesson
16:29 so to wade in James you better be
16:33 telling the truth because that shit's
16:35 waiting for you you don't want to meet
16:38 the g.od having dragged a guy through
16:41 the coals like this what we're gonna get
16:44 into it I was shocked to find out did
16:51 Wade Robson dated what a Michael
16:54 Jackson's nieces her name is a brandy
16:59 Jackson beautiful girl doesn't make a
17:03 sweet girl they met when he was very
17:08 very young I think it's around seven
17:11 that he did this photoshoot with Michael
17:12 could be plus or minus II it'd be less
17:15 to be either six or seven somewhere in
17:17 there he does his photo shoot and he
17:20 meets brandy and then over time he
17:23 begged Michael to set up a little
17:26 connection there and of course his uncle
17:29 being a good dude sets him up and they
17:32 maintain a friendship which then turns
17:34 into a relationship for ten years so
17:38 let's say he's seven so he's 17 when
17:40 it's over I couldn't quite get the fix
17:43 on how old she was she looked like she
17:46 might be just a little older in him but
17:47 then when I look at her today she looks
17:49 well younger than him not sure I suppose
17:53 I could look everybody up but I'm just
17:54 not gonna do that
17:56 so the documentary completely negates
17:58 the fact that he had this close
18:00 relationship with Michael Jackson's
18:02 niece
18:03 it seems like they achieved a romantic
18:06 relationship because the conclusion of
18:08 their relationship
18:09 was Wayde cheating on brandy with
18:14 allegedly Britney Spears according to
18:18 her and she seems like an extremely
18:21 level-headed person she didn't have that
18:26 entitlement she didn't have that like oh
18:30 my god voice you know me she was really
18:32 seemed extremely intelligent extremely
18:33 genuine and she said that other people
18:38 had brought her you know pulled her
18:40 aside and said it's not just her it's a
18:42 bunch of other people and they're
18:44 strategically people that would you know
18:47 give him an up in his career because
18:50 he's this very talented choreographer
18:53 and supposedly this relationship has
18:57 been alleged between Wade and Britney
18:59 Spears and that that supposedly broke
19:02 off the relationship she had with Justin
19:04 Timberlake one of my circles Justin said
19:08 that she was one of the stupidest human
19:10 beings that he had ever met and that's
19:12 why he decided to go sleep with other
19:16 people we'll never know and we shouldn't
19:20 care but isn't it interesting supposedly
19:25 there's a situation where Michael
19:27 Jackson is molesting Wade Robson every
19:31 single time they got together every
19:35 single time one of the listeners
19:38 reported in that wage said and it was
19:40 alleged in the documentary as backed up
19:44 by his mother and his sister that when
19:49 when they first came over when he was
19:51 seven years old I believe he stayed
19:53 there for a while
19:55 slept in the bed with his sister and
19:56 Michael Jackson supposedly pinky pinky's
19:59 going on with the sister into bed and
20:01 according to the graphic explanations of
20:04 what occurred how could the sister not
20:06 see something happening come on would
20:08 you even take a risk seriously but then
20:13 the second part of the story is that the
20:14 family had a trip planned to go to the
20:17 Grand Canyon they're from Australia so
20:18 it's even more intense than just seeing
20:21 the Grand Canyon if your United States
20:23 says
20:25 apparently when the attorneys for
20:27 Michael Jackson investigated this
20:28 allegation of him staying there he did
20:32 go with his parents to the Grand Canyon
20:34 he didn't stay back with Michael Jackson
20:38 that wasn't mentioned in the documentary
20:40 he just gets to say whatever he wants to
20:42 say and then everyone has to deal with
20:45 it James well he made a reference to
20:51 riding on the train at Neverland and the
20:55 year that he said that he wrote on the
20:57 train the train hadn't been installed
20:59 yet oopsie
21:01 that seems to be a problem but let's not
21:06 get it I should stop digressing into
21:08 these other fun facts but now imagine
21:11 you have this relationship with a
21:14 Brandie Jackson I mean any person in
21:17 there sane mind as long as she is
21:20 intelligent which she seemed extremely
21:22 intelligent in this interview and sweet
21:24 if you have this super fascination with
21:27 the Jackson family no one wants to admit
21:29 it but you know I've got friends who are
21:33 famous who said they've had problems
21:35 dating because people they can't figure
21:37 out whether the person wants to date
21:38 them to get the fortune within the
21:41 family or whether or not they want to
21:43 simply spread their seed with the family
21:45 okay I have a kid from a famous family
21:48 I'm set for life and by the way that
21:53 doesn't work because everybody has
21:54 attorneys doesn't work they can cut your
21:58 ass out in two seconds
22:00 you'd think you've got a case you won't
22:03 have a case so you better love the
22:05 person but now how is it that he's got
22:09 this romantic relationship eventually
22:11 with this girl but her uncle's
22:13 constantly molest in the kid and why
22:17 would an uncle who wants to have the kid
22:19 as his boyfriend ever participate in
22:23 setting him up with his niece why would
22:28 that ever occur its competition and how
22:32 does he have this relationship with this
22:33 girl for 10 years and never mentioned in
22:35 a documentary
22:37 oh because it probably would make you
22:40 doubt the [ __ ] story in the first
22:42 place wouldn't it now let's let's just
22:47 push pause for one second if you're
22:52 watching a documentary there is a reason
22:55 why we call them documentaries because
22:58 they are supposed to be an an analog of
23:02 truth they are supposed to be the most
23:05 unbiased well represented double-sided
23:09 analyses of a particular situation but
23:12 now we're not stupid right we know that
23:14 tons of documentaries are done on
23:16 history the victors write the history
23:19 books in this particular case dead men
23:22 tell no tales and so you can say
23:25 whatever you want so the thing is is
23:29 like if Wade's telling the truth
23:32 why wouldn't Wade say well I had this
23:36 relationship with his niece and what
23:39 made it weird was his her uncle was
23:41 molesting me why not say that why not
23:44 fully disclose things it's incredibly
23:49 important now the other thing that's
23:53 very interesting and again those who
23:55 want to believe we're going to throw
23:58 this next statement out the door but
23:59 it's very interesting that that they
24:02 might do that I watch a different video
24:06 this guy analyzed the video angles he he
24:11 was able to reconstruct how many
24:14 different times the camera seemed to be
24:16 moved turned off and on the daylight to
24:19 nighttime you know durations were going
24:23 on furniture would disappear furniture
24:25 would reappear like entire sofas were
24:29 installed and of course it could take
24:32 multiple weeks perhaps months to do some
24:35 of this stuff but it means seriously I'm
24:36 gonna tell you right now I having
24:38 created over 370 shows 380 shows if I
24:42 had a story to tell like this I'm gonna
24:45 get myself a big fat Cuban I'm gonna
24:47 turn on this camera and I'm gonna tell
24:50 you my story
24:51 and it's never gonna change I mean the
24:54 camera angles isn't gonna change maybe
24:56 I'll lose my light maybe it's nighttime
24:58 and I talks too damn long it goes into
25:00 daytime but you're gonna be able to get
25:03 the full story from start to finish from
25:05 me and hey I wasn't Michael Jackson's
25:11 protege right both these guys were told
25:13 they were gonna be directors like
25:15 Spielberg okay so you're got that level
25:18 of qualification and you can't stand her
25:20 sit in front of a camera and take a
25:21 continuous shot for more than maybe a
25:23 minute or two you can't speak fluently
25:26 that's the other thing that really
25:27 bothered me right when I first started a
25:29 documentary was the talking like this
25:35 and you know it's not normal
25:39 there's something wrong speak your mind
25:42 did something happen we'll just talk but
25:45 if you're trying to craft fiction you
25:50 know you're following a script you're
25:53 trying to punch words it's a drama it's
25:57 not real
25:58 this shows real love me or hate me so
26:04 one of the things that both of them said
26:06 was that Michael essentially molested
26:08 them all over the Neverland Ranch every
26:09 single room every single corner on the
26:12 train in the theater I mean if there was
26:15 a I mean just everywhere and there's a
26:21 gentleman that worked for Michael for 18
26:23 years his last name Sundberg he worked
26:27 with Michael and studios helping to
26:29 record setting up the studio's all the
26:31 a/v stuff the audio/video stuff helped
26:34 design the experiences within the
26:37 Neverland Ranch this guy knew the place
26:41 from the back of his hand he's a very
26:43 religious man as well within his
26:46 lifetime he has actually found a guy in
26:48 his church community in his church that
26:51 was molesting children he put the guy
26:52 away he flipped on the dude and put him
26:55 away and so they asked the guy you know
26:59 they said look one of the allegations
27:01 was that
27:03 I can't remember which guys said it this
27:06 is not something that's in the
27:07 documentary that I remember but it was
27:10 that these studios had green rooms you
27:13 know nice plush rooms that you can sit
27:15 and chill out and you are probably
27:17 fairly protected from the music it's
27:19 just so you can take a phone call
27:21 relax sleep whatever you got to do
27:23 practice on your part that's about to
27:25 come up and you know there's a lot of
27:27 people that record songs in segments
27:29 like Buckethead will sit in a green room
27:31 and practice and practice and practice
27:33 and then he goes out and does his miking
27:35 and it's all over right so the esses guy
27:38 is like is there enough time in his
27:41 recording schedule to have these
27:43 intimate events in a green room and the
27:45 guys like well he's like technically
27:48 speaking no one can say for sure whether
27:51 or not a onesie twosie thing might have
27:53 occurred but he's like these studios are
27:55 extremely protected no one's allowed in
27:58 unless you have an actual excuse to be
28:00 there so you can't just be guests
28:02 sitting around because it's about
28:05 business you know get in get out Michael
28:08 like being on the stage I'm not sure how
28:10 much Michael liked being in the
28:11 recording studio I'm just not sure but
28:15 it would seem that Michael being in the
28:16 studio completely by himself is unheard
28:18 of you have to have a sound engineer
28:20 with you running the board's recording
28:23 if you have any musicians that are
28:25 participating in the creation of the
28:26 music well they're sitting around
28:27 waiting if it's their day so somehow
28:30 this engineer would be outside and on
28:33 the main recording booth and then this
28:34 this sexcapade is happening in the green
28:37 room it starts to cut down the
28:40 likelihood that this is true
28:42 Debra claims that rooms had beds that
28:46 didn't have beds would have been easy
28:49 enough for jeans or weight or whatever I
28:51 think James was the one that really went
28:52 off about all the different rooms in
28:55 Neverland but he could have said well we
28:57 were on the floor just had to have it
28:59 just had to do this if you're gonna
29:02 remember and you're gonna recall it I'm
29:05 assuming you remember it the way it
29:07 occurred but this dude said 'no sunberg
29:11 I said look if Michael ever touched a
29:14 kid or if I ever saw a child looking
29:17 distressed or depressed or you know just
29:21 really changed they came in one way and
29:23 then Michael spent some time with them
29:25 and they walked out of the room and he
29:27 said I never saw a kid ever just change
29:29 and say you know we just you know look
29:32 distressed I say goes well if it's
29:36 happening then somehow the kids are fine
29:39 not to mean it's okay you know I kind of
29:41 stuff but he's like usually be some
29:45 traumatic situation there right there
29:48 was another thing with James and James
29:50 had said that Michael had called him
29:53 repeatedly and off the documentary he
29:57 said that I'm not sure if this is in
29:59 there exactly the way I'm gonna state
30:01 this but that Michael's assistants we're
30:05 calling him saying you gotta testify you
30:07 gotta testify you got to testify just
30:09 harassing and harassing harassing and
30:10 eventually he said no I'm not going to
30:11 testify on your behalf and then Michael
30:14 got very angry with him and threatened
30:16 him said he had big attorneys and all
30:18 this other stuff the problem for mr.
30:22 safe Chuck in this claim has he already
30:25 been dismissed by the judge in the case
30:29 stating that safety check will never be
30:32 allowed by the judge to testify so
30:35 there's two or three videos on this in
30:37 fact some of the people in the
30:38 prosecution starting the defense and
30:42 said look he was never gonna be allowed
30:44 to testify so this excuse and he goes
30:46 Michael knew this and Michael's defense
30:48 knew this and if Michael's asking
30:50 someone to testify on his behalf is
30:52 because his attorney said go get that
30:53 kid you gotta have that kid in the case
30:55 because he's gonna save our ass he was
31:00 dismissed there would be no reason for
31:03 Michael to ever solicit this kid now
31:05 maybe if the kid said look Michael said
31:08 you know I know you can't testify in
31:10 court but you could really do some TV
31:11 appearances for me that would have
31:13 changed the story a little bit but he
31:15 didn't make that statement he said that
31:17 Michael said you got to be in the case
31:20 so that isn't that up sorry
31:26 one of these guys Steve Ross from the
31:28 defense said that Wade was
31:31 cross-examined by three of the best
31:33 attorneys in the world in that area of
31:35 the world excuse me that they had
31:37 notorious backgrounds of being able to
31:40 break a witness and that when Wade was
31:43 on the side of Michael that they were
31:46 unable to get him to break any of his
31:49 story lines
31:50 he was always consistent everything he
31:52 said no matter how many times they asked
31:53 him he got all of his facts right which
31:56 is why Michael was acquitted on 14
31:58 different charges which is really
31:59 strange because I see 14 and one error I
32:01 see 10 and another the video where
32:04 outside thinks had 10 but when they
32:07 tallied all up I guess there were four
32:09 other charges somehow maybe they're
32:12 counting the 93 stuff I don't know
32:14 here's what's interesting
32:16 so Wade is able to tell this Michael
32:19 didn't touch me story as many times and
32:23 for many as many different perspectives
32:24 as he possibly can with these three
32:28 cross-examining attorneys and he never
32:30 breaks his story I mean they never find
32:33 any inconsistencies in the guy and
32:35 anyone who has inconsistencies and can't
32:37 remember things they're not the lead
32:39 witness for the defense because since
32:41 the Scott this yeah Scott Ross guy said
32:43 he said look by the time the defense
32:47 gets a chance to talk the prosecution is
32:49 already finished with their presentation
32:52 besides closing arguments you know and
32:54 so he goes they've already convinced the
32:56 jury potentially of the guilt of the of
33:01 the defendant and so the defense is
33:03 going to bring on their key witness
33:05 their top dog the one that can survive
33:08 all the cross-examination get the story
33:11 straight now isn't it weird the Wade
33:14 Robson can get all that right Michael
33:19 didn't touch me every single fact of
33:21 where he was when Hal what where he gets
33:24 that correct but the second he starts
33:25 saying that Michael touched him now his
33:27 story starts to change constantly both
33:31 guys have changed their stories they
33:34 have to for a lot of reasons because
33:35 again James saying he wrote on a train
33:37 that didn't exist
33:39 oopsie you know your credibility starts
33:43 to go down the tubes then michael
33:46 jackson's nephew is interviewed i don't
33:48 want to say his name wrong i think its
33:50 tie or Tate's like tha jackson looks
33:56 like a nice kid he grew up with michael
34:00 on his life and a lot of the behavior
34:02 that michael exhibited with these kids
34:04 that has hard evidence fax machine notes
34:08 and that kind of thing
34:09 michael did with them as well and so
34:13 then the nephew made a really good point
34:15 he said look taken out of context
34:17 looking at those faxes and just seeing
34:22 just Wade's faxes just James's faxes
34:27 makes it look strange but when you see
34:31 our faxes he's saying the same thing to
34:33 us and we're his relatives and we know
34:36 nothing happened to us Michael like to
34:40 use the word doodoo he was uncle doodoo
34:43 whatever that is my father had thousand
34:48 pet names for himself and me and I
34:50 couldn't repeat any him on this show
34:52 without potentially angering you guys
34:54 we're the thought police on language so
34:58 it's his innocent way of giving himself
35:00 a little nickname now he would call at
35:03 least one of the two guys you know
35:06 doodoo it's just like a nice way to say
35:09 you know something that I mean a case
35:16 I'll share one on with you so when my
35:18 father saw the movie the jerk by Steve
35:20 Martin there was a funny scene in the
35:23 movie where a dog it's a sister's
35:28 reenactment Steve Martin is staying in
35:29 this hotel or motel excuse me and the
35:32 dog comes up and starts barking and he's
35:33 seeing like Old Yeller or something so
35:36 what is the dog there's a fire the place
35:40 is on fire and he starts going everybody
35:41 get out it's a fire and so he creates
35:43 this huge chaotic situation there
35:45 weren't there wasn't a fire and so he
35:48 ends up adopting the dog and this guy
35:50 walks up to him and says this is your
35:51 dog and he says yeah
35:53 I'm calling him like I forgot what he
35:55 was calling him I think I'm gonna call
35:57 him like lifesaver
35:58 or something like that and that guy
35:59 looks at him he says you should call him
36:00 [ __ ] because he made this event
36:02 occur and we're all outside when we
36:04 didn't you know you just pulled the fire
36:06 alarm for no reason and say it's okay
36:08 come here [ __ ] you know and he
36:10 starts calling the dog [ __ ] so my father
36:12 thought it was he would call a [ __ ]
36:14 every once in a while because of that
36:16 funny line so we're all thinking about
36:18 the jerk we're not actually feeling like
36:19 our parent is calling us you know a
36:22 dirty word so when I see Michael Jackson
36:27 using doo-doo I see a guy using the same
36:30 sort of thought process but he's a good
36:32 dude so it doesn't use dirty words with
36:34 a child that's all I get out of that but
36:37 the nephew made a good point
36:39 he showed countless letters and stuff
36:42 for all this language that was in the
36:43 faxes to these kids were being used with
36:45 him but he also showed the human element
36:48 of Michael to say everyone overlooks the
36:51 fact that these faxes also had
36:53 inspirational messages rehearse rehearse
36:56 rehearse the world is yours you just got
36:59 to work hard for it I mean even one of
37:01 the letters he said please rehearse to
37:03 one of his nephews that's cool right
37:06 don't I do my own version of that on the
37:08 show so what I didn't know about these
37:12 two gentlemen was the financial problems
37:16 that both these families are having the
37:18 Robson family and the safe Chuck family
37:25 now Wade I can't say it was an easy come
37:29 easy go sort of thing because Wade I
37:32 think factually can be proven to have
37:34 worked extremely hard to become a
37:36 choreographer and he was a dancer from
37:39 these are like - by the time he was five
37:41 he was amazing about time he was seven
37:44 he was dancing on stage with Michael
37:46 Jackson he was he had that whole Michael
37:50 Jackson thing down and then he invented
37:51 his own style of dancing which you don't
37:54 get to be the choreographer for
37:56 choreographer for Britney Spears and
37:58 Justin Timberlake's in sync man without
38:01 having some serious skills yeah the guy
38:04 could dance man
38:05 he's unlovely dude so
38:07 it all comes together he's doing well
38:10 but he's burning the candle from both
38:12 sides this was what I'm about to mention
38:17 wasn't mentioned in the documentary and
38:20 that there was this opportunity in 2011
38:23 for Wade Robson to audition for the
38:29 Michael Jared the Michael Jackson a
38:31 circus Olay event that was going to
38:33 critic it's a Vegas show he had written
38:36 a letter to circus Olay saying look this
38:39 is a dream of mine I've wanted to do
38:41 this forever
38:41 I know Michael Jackson so we we have
38:43 some resources here and he basically put
38:47 together a really good letter just
38:48 stating why he wanted to do this show I
38:50 mean hats off to the dude you got to do
38:52 what you got to do but he took
38:56 interviews and said he got the gig when
39:00 he didn't have the gig according to
39:01 these later documents it was later given
39:06 to another guy
39:08 so another dude got the gig he didn't
39:11 get well the whole thing is portrayed in
39:15 the documentaries if he did get it
39:17 strange he said he had Michael come and
39:19 talk to the circus silly people so I'm a
39:22 little confused it's a fact in Wikipedia
39:25 he did not produce this show but it was
39:29 never portrayed in the documentary that
39:31 way people have dug into Wade's life
39:36 recently I saw a whole documentary I
39:38 think produced I don't know if it's
39:40 produced out of England but it's got a
39:41 British woman's voice on it and they
39:45 analyzed his whole financial situation
39:48 including the fact that he had just
39:50 recently sold a house for like eight
39:51 hundred thirty thousand dollars
39:54 supposedly he's unable to get you know
39:57 the kind of work he used to get again
40:01 you get into those industries you're
40:04 gonna be hot for a while and if you
40:05 don't reinvent yourself you know and you
40:09 know it doesn't even matter if you
40:10 reinvent yourself I don't know how many
40:11 shows have a bunch of dancers on stage
40:13 anymore you know J Lo's got her gig and
40:17 Britney to get has her gig but Britney's
40:19 on-and-off here
40:21 there and you know as Britney I mean
40:22 would you really keep a guy the same
40:24 choreographer for 10 20 years know you'd
40:28 get new choreographers because you need
40:29 a new method of dancing that breathes
40:32 life into your routine even that er way
40:35 would have to prove that he is
40:36 completely reinvented himself and if he
40:39 creates a second third fourth fifth show
40:41 it's gonna look completely different
40:42 than the first couple tours that he
40:44 worked on I just don't think the boy
40:47 band thing is out there anymore like it
40:48 used to be so his his skill set is
40:52 unfortunately perhaps maybe not in as
40:55 much demand and so he's dealing with the
41:00 life that we talk about on the show a
41:01 lot you can be on top and then you can
41:05 be on bottom now they did mention the
41:09 fact that a lawsuit had been brought up
41:11 against the Jackson estate and that it
41:16 was lost due to the fact that
41:17 California's state I think I loosely
41:20 mention this but California State has a
41:22 four-year pedophile statute of
41:25 limitations which is insane so there's
41:29 one amount of money that the Wade Robson
41:32 legal team is going for with the Jackson
41:36 family estate and then they notified
41:40 according to these videos online that
41:43 you know flash up the core cases and
41:46 that Wade joined it they're sorry that
41:49 James joined Wade's lawsuit against the
41:53 family the whole thing was thrown out of
41:54 court because of the statute of
41:56 limitations you know if they're telling
41:59 the truth it's an injustice for them but
42:04 again there's certainly a lot of holes
42:07 in the story now your nephew talks about
42:11 the the sister of Wade who when you
42:17 watch the documentary her tears are
42:20 extremely believable and again when I
42:25 say you have to act
42:30 to a certain degree to get someone like
42:33 me to believe you you know there was
42:35 there was a guy that the guy that
42:37 actually picked apart the camera angles
42:39 it was very flippant about the fact that
42:42 people can be coached to act and I think
42:44 that Wade could be coached to act and I
42:47 think that maybe James could be coached
42:48 to act because he was an actor but their
42:50 mothers and their sisters and their
42:52 brothers it's a different game the
42:56 methodology that you typically do is if
42:59 your technical actor then you have an
43:00 amazing command of your of the human
43:03 body there are certain tricks
43:07 hyperventilating can make you make your
43:10 eyes water a little bit then you're kind
43:12 of weird cuz you're all you know riled
43:15 up method acting is to think of
43:17 something else that makes you cry Wade's
43:21 father hung himself I'm willing to bet
43:24 that if you needed to go somewhere you
43:27 could go there it's a horrible thing
43:29 that happened and you know I think we
43:32 all wish if we could send him some
43:34 correctional love that would be where we
43:37 would change his life story and keep his
43:38 dad alive you know it's not a joke it's
43:43 not something we should flip early
43:44 disrespect in my opinion regardless of
43:47 what these guys are saying and whether
43:48 they're telling the truth or not they
43:51 have now gone into the safe Chuck family
43:53 and I guess the safe Chuck family this
43:54 is something that's not in the
43:55 documentary I can kind of understand why
43:58 it's not in the documentary but I guess
44:00 the family was in the waste business
44:02 they were in the trash business and
44:03 somehow they had some royalty that they
44:06 got they were with a it's called Sisu
44:11 something or other waste and there was
44:15 some payments that were coming to them
44:18 and by 2000 I think even like a 10 or 11
44:22 or somewhere in there they were notified
44:23 they weren't gonna make any more money
44:25 and so the family who had their house
44:27 purchased and and loaned to them that
44:31 the the bank loan came to them by
44:33 Michael Jackson in the documentary they
44:37 say that the loan was simply forgiven
44:40 out of thin air after they testified and
44:43 on the
44:44 half of Michael Jackson and I believe
44:46 the 2005 trial sort of as a reward they
44:52 got bought off the other documentation
44:58 on the outside claims okay I haven't
45:01 seen this personally and they weren't
45:03 able to provide the actual legal
45:05 back-and-forth so this may or may not be
45:07 true but the claim was that Michaels
45:09 estate was continuing to ask for
45:11 payments and the family simply revealed
45:15 this this trash business going south and
45:19 the fact they weren't going to make
45:20 anymore
45:21 royalty payments are gonna we're not
45:22 going to receive any more income from
45:24 this business as supposedly they helped
45:25 build and so Michael just simply after
45:30 asking for the money several times just
45:33 gave up the loan and said well whatever
45:34 you can just keep it so that side of the
45:38 story is true that Michael is a really
45:39 good guy giving away a house now I have
45:45 been to let's see how I say this like I
45:52 said the previous episode I got friends
45:53 that have worked with him a couple times
45:54 I also went to Thomas Dolby's private
46:00 concerts he gave or he gave it inside
46:02 the the grammy facilities in l.a love
46:06 our guy he's a brilliant dude but he has
46:08 some pretty interesting anecdotes as
46:09 well about just the financial
46:16 shortcomings of the michael jackson
46:18 estate in that Michael would want to buy
46:21 things and get things from people and
46:23 that it wasn't uncommon for those
46:27 payments to never be made and it could
46:31 be just as the problem could just simply
46:34 as simple as michael says to meets you
46:36 in public and goes hey yeah I'll give
46:38 you $10,000 and he walks off and he
46:40 never gives it to you then you seek the
46:41 money from the estate and they're like
46:46 we don't know you we don't know that
46:48 you're telling the truth and we're not
46:49 going to stop Michael from touring to
46:51 ask them if they met a complete stranger
46:53 to say you know do you
46:57 do you really call for someone $10,000
47:00 and was this their name did they look
47:02 like this was it in Minnesota or
47:04 whatever it happened I can tell you by
47:07 hanging out with various that's not even
47:10 like massive celebrities but just
47:12 average celebrities and I you know you
47:15 can say that but like they're not
47:16 household names people pay for things
47:19 like I said I forgot to mention you know
47:22 as I hung out with rockers in my
47:25 lifetime I've been with you know very
47:27 famous lead singers and we're hanging
47:28 out in like a nightclub in Vegas and
47:31 they're right there and I'm here and
47:33 there's no one else here and we're
47:34 having this conversation and dudes will
47:36 just walk in and you know kneel down and
47:39 hey mister so-and-so
47:40 I really you know you're a big
47:42 inspiration well I love your work and
47:43 they'll plot this row of like
47:45 hundred-dollar bills like the
47:46 old-fashioned 50s game that they used to
47:49 play when I was a kid and I didn't live
47:51 in the 50s but that that kind of game
47:53 went on for you know a long time and I
47:57 watched this happening can I get you a
47:59 drink and they want to be able to say I
48:01 bought so-and-so a drink that's all they
48:03 want to do so I've seen this personally
48:05 several times and so you get this you
48:07 get acclimated the fact that I want to
48:09 pay for anything so you don't go never
48:11 go to the ATM you never ask your system
48:13 for any cash you don't even worry about
48:14 it because wherever you go someone's to
48:16 buy you dinner Michael Jackson was here
48:18 on this patio I'd say dude I'll buy you
48:20 dinner it won't be that good by judging
48:26 for everything we've heard he'd be
48:27 satisfied so Wade and James seem to be
48:31 in financial troubles Wade kind of
48:36 banked his career on becoming a movie
48:38 director because Michael told both of
48:41 them you know you're gonna be a big
48:43 director Steven Spielberg level which I
48:45 just think is so funny it's like oh
48:47 really you're you know god bless you man
48:51 with James that statement is ridiculous
48:55 Steven Spielberg is you know there's a
48:58 bunch accusations against him right now
49:00 which we will go into and I hope they're
49:01 not true but seriously that dude was a
49:04 prodigy of prodigies if you were Steven
49:07 Spielberg you wouldn't need Michael
49:09 Jackson
49:09 for anything you would be a little
49:12 Kubrick and you go off and make a great
49:14 and you know host above she would find
49:17 great scripts great books and you just
49:19 be turning them into movies left and
49:21 right you would not need any help
49:22 whatsoever if you potentially had the
49:25 gene pool to be considered in that camp
49:28 of you know Steven Spielberg George
49:31 Lucas you know Ridley Scott those huge
49:35 directors that owned the 80s James
49:38 Cameron Mike I mean the James Cameron II
49:41 Michael Jackson no did these people get
49:44 help yeah sure but they brought the
49:46 goods too so I'm sure he made money from
49:51 all their performances they don't air
49:53 those Pepsi commercials anymore so he's
49:55 not making any money from that but they
49:57 just got paid for this documentary
49:58 supposedly right so the motive to make
50:02 money to save a family is huge someone
50:06 you know insinuated that when the safe
50:08 Chuck's found out that they weren't
50:09 going to make money off of their trash
50:15 company that they might have come to
50:17 their son for a loan but now that's
50:19 quite a long time ago they're talking
50:20 about nine years ago this stuff fell
50:22 through so who knows now the other thing
50:26 was is that the integrity of the cases
50:28 that went up against Michael and
50:30 actually got money out of him are rather
50:33 important and it was this Geordi
50:38 Chandler the father of Geordi Chandler
50:40 this was the dude who left the
50:41 voicemails all over his attorneys
50:44 voicemail systems back in the 90s these
50:47 are the kind name if you have a machine
50:48 in your house and someone called your
50:50 house and lets a voicemail the whole
50:51 house could hear the message how crazy
50:53 son the idea was that you could hear the
50:56 call and then run over to the phone you
50:59 could screen your calls basically this
51:00 is someone I want to talk to you that
51:02 kind of thing but that guy left a
51:05 voicemail that said I'm gonna take down
51:08 Michael Jackson he specifically said
51:12 that he hired the nastiest attorney in
51:13 the world and this guy was going to so
51:16 destroy Michael Jackson if he didn't pay
51:18 that he wouldn't be able to sell another
51:20 record
51:22 well this was the guy that when I was
51:26 driving home in the Bay Area San
51:29 Francisco area 1993 I remember I had
51:31 30-minute commute home which I hated I
51:35 just remember that I just remember I
51:37 remember exactly where I was on the 280
51:41 and I heard this guy say I know he
51:46 didn't touch my kid but don't you think
51:47 it's worth 20 million dollars the guy in
51:53 my categorization is a scumbag these
51:57 voicemails perfectly document someone
52:01 who was out to get money to extort out
52:04 of a fictional story then they said well
52:09 Michael settled the case and so he's
52:10 guilty he decided to pay the kid off
52:13 instead of going through court well
52:17 there's a technicality there that I
52:19 personally experienced in my lifetime
52:20 when I was 18 years old I was extremely
52:23 successful I bought a brand-new car with
52:25 my own money
52:26 my parents would not cosign because they
52:27 showed so much trust in me that they
52:30 wouldn't cosign my loan here they are
52:32 they don't have to pay for my college
52:33 they don't have to help me out in
52:35 California and they wouldn't co-sign it
52:36 loan cuz they said are you just gonna go
52:37 tits-up on this loan Thanks things mom
52:40 and dad so I bought this thing myself
52:43 got screwed on my interest rates trust
52:45 me 18 year old kid buying a brand new
52:47 car all right drive it home
52:50 another 18 year old kid behind me test
52:53 driving a car why was he test driving a
52:55 car because he had hit someone six
52:57 months earlier and totaled his car and
53:01 so he was poking around was an old 76
53:04 Challenger he's poking around a 118 I'm
53:08 going home he's barely going the speed
53:10 limit and so I'm like man I gotta get
53:11 around this guy's it's driving me nuts
53:13 so I just dropped that thing into fifth
53:15 gear turbo went on got around him but
53:18 then he starts racing me on the pass and
53:22 I'm looking over I can't believe it he's
53:23 in my blind spot I looked over and so I
53:25 just punched a little bit got around the
53:27 guy no problem but now we're going
53:28 faster and we should not even sure how
53:30 fast I was going but I look up and
53:32 there's this idiot on the highway
53:35 in the middle of the night one of the
53:35 most dangerous highways is the 118 in
53:38 California 23 to paying is worse but
53:40 this is the next worst thing it's like
53:42 up and down up and down up in this year
53:43 your view ability is really bad this guy
53:46 is stopped on the highway letting some
53:50 field workers who had worked some really
53:53 late shift get in their car and they
53:55 were driving onto the highways the guy
53:56 stops so I'm looking up and I'm looking
53:59 at a car halted inside like oh my god so
54:04 I managed to hit the brakes perfectly
54:05 did my own little ABS impersonation
54:07 didn't hit the guy in front of me I was
54:09 fine but look in the rearview mirror
54:11 here comes a douchebag in his car 18 I
54:14 just see headlights going left right
54:15 left right guys lost complete control of
54:17 this car he doesn't even own the car he
54:20 manages to swerve away from me instead
54:22 of hitting me thank God he probably
54:24 killed me hits my left rear quarter
54:27 panel goes across the street it's a
54:29 little dirt and bang when it flips the
54:30 car upside down so I'm driving next this
54:32 guy his car is upside down just like a
54:34 Hollywood movie
54:35 dirts flying everywhere lands on the
54:37 hood and he lands on the top of the car
54:39 gasoline is just gushing out of this
54:41 dudes car it's like a movie for some
54:44 reason the guy in the backseat they got
54:46 the pastor she had managed to get out
54:47 instantaneously and the dude in the
54:49 driver's seat his decides a little more
54:51 collapsed and so he's hauling ass he's
54:52 trying to get out the car I'm thinking
54:53 this thing's gonna explode gasoline just
54:56 gushing out of this freaking locked gas
54:59 cap that just wasn't doing its job you
55:02 know so clearly these dudes fall by me
55:05 of course the cops show up and they
55:08 split us apart and I'm starting to this
55:11 kid out immediately we're both 18 I'm
55:13 just like what the f were you doing
55:15 passing me on the turn Jesus and passed
55:17 me on that you know racing me on the
55:18 pass scuse me and he's like oh my god my
55:22 dad's gonna kill me my dad's gonna kill
55:23 me as all I can say because he just
55:25 totaled two cars in six months he is a
55:29 shitty driver so that night he
55:33 apologized claimed responsibility for
55:36 the accident we go home next day I call
55:39 him up ah he's playing stupid I don't
55:42 know what you're talking about man oh my
55:44 god here we go
55:46 my insurance company paid that [ __ ]
55:50 $10,000 because whatever his attorney
55:55 was his father hired an attorney I mean
55:58 they must have it must have just barely
55:59 paid off this attorney the guy
56:01 questioned me for fifty minutes in front
56:02 of my attorney from the other from my
56:04 insurance company and I thought we
56:08 wanted my attorney came out and he's
56:09 like dude you held that guy off like no
56:11 one I've ever seen you're only 18 years
56:13 old this guy he's usually done with guys
56:15 in 10 minutes you took you took you an
56:17 hour I said what did I say anything
56:18 wrong so not that I know of was a great
56:21 so we're clean right yeah mm-hmm boom
56:23 paid the kid off got a brand-new car for
56:26 being a douchebag wasn't my fault but
56:31 now that went on my record same thing
56:35 with Michael Jackson
56:36 he had an insurance company that the
56:39 policy qualified for coverage of this
56:41 exact type an accusation of this exact
56:43 type so they didn't want to fight it
56:45 Michael was told personally that the
56:48 case was going to take seven years in
56:49 court and up to two or three different
56:52 law firms to handle this that serve a
56:55 million dollars a month okay maybe it
57:01 was a year but they chose to pay the kid
57:03 off now I've heard just all over the
57:08 camp of what this is what the Chandler
57:10 family made I don't know if we can trust
57:14 any of the numbers that are out there
57:15 I've heard as low as 10 I've heard as
57:17 high as 23 Michael said it wasn't
57:19 anything that was printed in the
57:21 tabloids maybe one of you know how much
57:23 they actually got paid but I don't know
57:25 how that would be the case because it's
57:26 supposed to be private and Ray one of
57:29 the families that accused him remember
57:31 exactly the last name my price shouldn't
57:34 even say one of them the family had a
57:36 huge history of a mother that coerced
57:38 her son's into extorting money out of
57:41 people getting money out of people
57:43 including them coming home from school
57:45 and she had a bunch of post-its all over
57:48 the table of things that you say to get
57:50 closer to people so you pulling their
57:52 heartstrings so you get a little bit of
57:53 money here and there
57:57 faking affection to people so they would
57:59 eventually give you a 5 here 10 there 20
58:01 there so the family had a massive
58:05 history of deception of course they
58:10 extorted Michael it's the game
58:12 it's the game they play now there's a
58:16 lot of videos out there that simply pick
58:18 apart every single thing that Wade and
58:21 James have said after they turned
58:24 against Michael and again what is
58:28 fascinating is is that their stories
58:31 change and change and change sometimes
58:34 drastically sometimes just a little bit
58:36 but again when they were telling the
58:40 truth about all of their encounters with
58:41 Michael they knew exactly where they
58:43 were how long they were there and their
58:45 stories never interfered with the
58:49 evidence that was in Discovery the other
58:53 thing we have to remember is that
58:54 Michael was I mean maybe Michael was
58:56 tipped off potentially but Michael was
59:02 grabbed in the middle of the night
59:04 Neverland Ranch was absolutely scoured
59:07 every building every closet everything
59:11 was examined all of his magazines all of
59:17 his videos all this stuff and you know
59:21 his interview with his wife at the time
59:23 Presley the daughter of Elvis and you
59:29 know you can see that she's backing him
59:31 up because you know she's not gonna back
59:34 the dude up if if it's gonna make her
59:35 look like crap eventually but she just
59:39 kept you know they both have said look
59:41 there's nothing that's come out of any
59:43 of this investigation
59:44 Michael's body was completely
59:46 photographed supposedly VORs moles on
59:49 his body in this particular place that
59:50 the kids had said was you know in his
59:53 genital region and none of that locked
59:55 in if any of that had locked in I think
59:58 he would have lost those cases with the
60:00 jury in his 2005 trial now let's back up
60:07 back to the documentary
60:10 what are the most convincing elements of
60:12 the documentary and what are the molar
60:14 suspects elements of the documentary hmm
60:18 well the people that have analyzed this
60:21 documentary over and over and over their
60:24 big thing is to say look when they're
60:28 just recalling their time with Michael
60:30 before any allegations of wrongdoing
60:33 it's pretty much just a movie here's a
60:36 bunch of pictures of them together much
60:38 of you know faxes that are shown or
60:42 whatever pieces of physical evidence
60:43 that they have but the second they
60:46 traverse this this moment of starting to
60:49 accuse Michael of all these different
60:50 things there's no evidence it's just two
60:54 guys talking hmm when you go back again
60:57 to the claims of where they were when
60:59 they were there's a girlfriend missing
61:02 for ten years out of the documentary
61:04 would that be important there's also a
61:07 book and I can't pronounce the last
61:11 guy's name but there's a fictional book
61:14 written about the Jordan Chandler Sun
61:17 written by this guy Victor something or
61:20 other starts with the G and he wrote
61:23 this weird book claiming to know what
61:26 happened with this kid is Jordan kid and
61:29 what's interesting about it is that
61:32 James safe Chuck the second kid his
61:38 court filing against Michael Jackson
61:40 which led to this billion dollar case
61:43 but he went in on Wade with over and
61:48 over and over there's all these
61:49 consistencies these weird consistencies
61:51 between what's in this book and what's
61:54 in James's case the Chandler family who
61:59 sued and got money from the insurance
62:02 company on Michael Jackson's side
62:04 disowned the book and disowned the
62:06 events that were portrayed in the book
62:08 between the child Jordan and Michael
62:11 Jackson now I don't know why they would
62:14 do that they won in court why not say oh
62:16 well yeah you know we even reviewed my
62:18 son or he took the court filing that we
62:21 filed and he just wrote a book about
62:23 but it seems that maybe maybe James's
62:27 legal team so man this is great it's the
62:30 50 shades of grey of a fictional story
62:33 of Michael Jackson molesting kids and
62:36 we're just gonna poach it very specific
62:38 things about jealousy and serving
62:41 alcohol to kids and what's interesting
62:43 about it is that Wade said in the
62:45 documentary in the second half of the
62:47 second show that he had never seen
62:50 Michael drink alcohol and when Michael
62:53 came over in his later years after being
62:56 married and what-have-you and having the
62:57 you know the three children that he had
62:59 that he was saying you know bring some
63:02 wine bring some wine and he said man I
63:04 got excited because I thought maybe I'd
63:06 get a chance to sit down with Michael
63:07 and have a man on man conversation just
63:09 about life and things we'd sit and chill
63:11 and drink red wine and of course he said
63:14 that Michael was just pouring you know
63:16 gigantic red cups of red wine he just
63:18 you know downing it which is you know we
63:23 don't chug wine it's way too powerful
63:26 it's so great unless you're sasha Cohen
63:29 playing a fictional character and it's
63:32 funny but according to all these
63:35 accusations you know Michael Jackson's
63:37 feeding kids wine
63:38 why didn't Waze say well the wine came
63:41 back right the wine came back into the
63:43 situation hmm so again all the
63:49 accusations lack any super hard facts
63:51 we got a maid who's perjured herself in
63:54 court someone later heard that that she
63:58 said that Michael Jackson threatened her
63:59 life i sat and rewatched the whole
64:02 second half of the documentary where
64:04 they all the accusations came out I
64:06 hadn't seen you that I just saw a news
64:08 reel that was put in there and saying
64:12 you've been threatened he's ridiculous I
64:16 mean what does Michael having people
64:17 bumped off like the Clintons no so you
64:20 go in and you say what you got to say
64:22 and you don't perjure yourself and you
64:24 never change your story we're they gonna
64:25 kill you we're they gonna sue you when
64:28 you're telling the truth I mean
64:29 seriously there's no repercussions for
64:33 telling the truth and this particular
64:35 because he's not a gangster no the fact
64:39 that Wade and James are still alive is
64:41 proof that nothing happens to you after
64:42 you say these things even if you're a
64:44 lion now the other two characters I
64:47 mentioned and I mentioned this in the
64:49 first version of the show and this is
64:51 where you get into you know probably not
64:55 the it's it's hard to say so
64:59 Macaulay Culkin has just kept his story
65:02 straight dude never touch me spend tons
65:05 of time together that's it done with
65:10 Corey Feldman he said look Michael never
65:13 touched me
65:13 Michael always insisted on the cut it
65:16 frustrated him because he said he wanted
65:18 Michael to sleep next to him
65:19 Michael's his hero Michael could do no
65:22 wrong but Michael always insisted on a
65:24 cut well that doesn't sound like a guy
65:27 he was serial molesting two other kids
65:30 in the world plus the other two that you
65:33 know got dragged through this whole
65:34 thing as well but Feldman said that
65:39 Michael showed him like nudie magazines
65:42 at one point and he said you know I
65:44 didn't think anything of it it's like
65:46 two guys seeing something and then you
65:49 know he got up he got older had a kid of
65:51 his own he's like then I started
65:52 realizing how screwed up that was
65:54 because the guy was so much older you
65:56 can't really disagree but I've grown up
66:01 in the Midwest having you know like I
66:04 said you know times were different and
66:06 we all lived from some of the non
66:10 molestation things you know it was like
66:12 if you saw a nudie mag when I was a kid
66:15 it belonged to an adult what that was
66:17 how the hell do you think these things
66:18 could you know get into our hands so
66:20 we're gonna walk into a porn shop yeah
66:22 nine years old I just thought I'd like
66:23 to see what a girl looks like below the
66:25 waist you know without any clothes on
66:27 you get him from adults like I mean I
66:31 don't know if I mentioned this in that
66:32 particular episode but when I was a kid
66:33 I was like probably 12 12 13 years old
66:39 and I was going to junior high in
66:41 Massachusetts I got some program where I
66:44 could sweep the sweep instead of going
66:47 to class I got to sweep the place and be
66:48 a little janitors
66:49 there's a bunch of us it's probably six
66:51 of us and we go down to the boiler room
66:53 to meet the old dude who was a the
66:58 janitor him he was sort of just kind of
66:59 out of it the whole time and I remember
67:01 showing up and these kids had been doing
67:04 this for a long time and there was just
67:06 this ritual Dixie Cups those little tiny
67:10 cups you're supposed to drink throw away
67:11 he line them all up and he pour saw
67:14 little shot a jack and we'd [ __ ]
67:16 pound this stuff and get little tipsy
67:19 and then you're you're sweeping the
67:21 school and you're just chilling you're a
67:23 little high you're like oh man this
67:24 makes it so much better
67:25 anything else you want me to do I got
67:28 those cups
67:29 I never told on the dude none of the
67:32 other kids told him the guy he didn't
67:34 get fired I knew that dude because I
67:35 kept coming in really early to set this
67:39 thing up for class because they we had
67:41 some fluoride you know thing that they
67:44 were getting us to brush our teeth right
67:46 when we got to school with something
67:47 Colgate was putting on but I'd always
67:49 had the janitor let me in because it was
67:50 really he never touched me he never paid
67:52 any attention to me the guy was like 10
67:54 sheets to his dementia I don't know he
67:56 just kind of was a zombie guy all right
67:59 I live all right and we dumpster dived
68:02 in my apartment complex as a kid found
68:04 x-rated you know magazines
68:07 we lived okay we figured out how the
68:10 body works a little bit if someone has
68:13 experienced this for real they can keep
68:18 their story straight they have emotional
68:21 scars due to these situations occurring
68:23 I can completely understand why they
68:26 might watch the documentary and remember
68:28 things completely different insert
68:30 things that didn't exist in the in the
68:32 documentary to further suffer their own
68:36 past I get that I respect that
68:40 but the problem is is that we have a guy
68:42 who died in 2009 being utterly crucified
68:46 ten years later by people that can't
68:50 seem to keep their stories straight by
68:52 two individuals who have severe
68:56 financial problems by two people that
68:58 were probably and probably to this day
69:02 mourning the law
69:03 of their friend and having animosity
69:07 because they weren't kept as the
69:10 ultimate favorite until the very end you
69:15 know it could be and you know it
69:16 probably is true that Michael hung out
69:20 with these kids they had VIP treatment I
69:23 mean my god these kids toured with him
69:26 individually in different camps that
69:29 that part is factually proven by
69:32 photographs and movies of them dancing
69:34 on stage and hanging out with him all
69:36 right and then at the end you know ten
69:40 years goes by all the promises of easy
69:43 fast success for one of the guys didn't
69:45 occur thinking that somehow you were
69:48 going to just know kung fu I'm gonna say
69:50 but you're gonna be the next Steven
69:52 Spielberg and without trying very hard
69:55 it isn't doesn't happen okay
69:59 well whose fault is it that is is it
70:01 that that happened is it Michaels fault
70:04 no what did Michael do Michael found his
70:07 talent rehearsed
70:10 Busta's ass and became famous his father
70:14 and his brothers being the shoulders
70:16 that he stood on you know other amazing
70:19 musicians etc etc I can see where they
70:24 could be ending their life with
70:27 animosity towards Michael I mean I can
70:30 see that be possibility one of the guys
70:34 made a good point about the Rings one of
70:36 the most emotional parts about the
70:38 documentary is that James safe Chuck
70:43 said that there was a mock wedding when
70:46 he was nine years old and that was a
70:48 wedding ring given to him by Michael and
70:51 he brings this little box out and this
70:54 is when the his whole apartment or house
70:56 or whatever changes complete decor the
70:58 chairs he had behind him turned into a
71:00 big sofa the painting was still on the
71:02 wall but it was definitely a different
71:04 setup the chair he was sitting in
71:05 changed and that's not a sin you know it
71:08 could be that he remembered this or
71:09 decided to reveal this or what have you
71:12 maybe the documentary film Baker's if
71:13 this is all true simply said we need
71:15 something else you told us about the
71:17 are you willing to talk about the rings
71:19 and these these ponies rings out his
71:21 hands are shaking intensely well they
71:23 could be shaking for two different
71:24 reasons one he's telling the truth -
71:28 he's telling a lie and it's an
71:31 outrageous lie if it's a lie right but
71:35 the dudes were looking at the Rings
71:37 going those don't look like baby rings
71:39 his kids supposedly a minor and he's got
71:43 these rings and but these rings look
71:45 like they could fit on a average-sized
71:47 adult now I don't have any opinion there
71:52 because I don't remember they did I mean
71:54 in my memory it kind of looks a little
71:55 bit big I can see the Rings in my head I
71:57 can't remember the ring gauge I don't
71:59 know he kind of slipped one over one of
72:01 his fingers I don't think it was able to
72:03 go past his knuckle so I don't know just
72:06 one of those things the woman who does
72:10 body language she took one of Michael's
72:12 I guess you might call it a deposition
72:15 and interview something like that he had
72:17 his attorney in the room and he's being
72:19 interviewed by one of the I guess
72:23 potential prosecution attorneys or
72:25 something and she read his body language
72:29 and was picking him apart something that
72:32 he was sort of hiding something that you
72:35 know does that any other thing but one
72:38 of the documentaries I watched tonight
72:40 one of the debunking documentaries had
72:42 the extended version of the actual
72:44 interview when he started speaking
72:47 fluently about you know potential
72:51 interview questions and a bunch of other
72:52 stuff and when you watch the second half
72:54 of the interview with him he loses a lot
72:59 of his insecurities here's what I think
73:04 that we I think the fans of Michael
73:09 maybe see this instantaneously and I
73:12 think those that want to throw them
73:14 under the bus don't see potentially is
73:19 that we don't insert ourselves into his
73:24 shoes and say okay what is empathy
73:28 empathy is feeling when another person
73:30 feel
73:31 it's an extremely important process when
73:34 you're trying to read what's going on in
73:36 the world where do you put your
73:38 sympathies where do you put your
73:40 resources where do you put your
73:41 dedication in such etc well imagine you
73:46 know you're a little strange as his
73:48 nephew said if they had a birthday party
73:51 Michael would interview them about the
73:53 birthday party and say well what was it
73:55 like interesting who would ask that
73:58 question
73:59 besides someone who missed their
74:01 childhood and completely doesn't know
74:03 what that situation is like I think one
74:07 of his younger brothers was at his
74:09 funeral and said you know when they came
74:15 home from school they would try to get
74:19 something to eat
74:19 run to the TV and they liked to watch
74:23 The Three Stooges and the game was they
74:25 try to watch as much TV as possible
74:28 before they got the phone call that they
74:30 had to go to the studio to rehearse to
74:34 record to get back on track with the
74:36 career how can you imagine that I'm
74:39 never coming home I was a you know a kid
74:44 that came home to an empty house I would
74:46 let myself into the house so this is
74:48 like eight seven eight years old both
74:50 those years and I would let myself in I
74:52 get myself some food and I'd sit down in
74:54 front of Tom and Jerry and the whole
74:56 gang and watch cartoons until my parents
74:58 came home a couple hours later no
75:02 babysitter no nothing I got my world I
75:04 could I could own the house I could play
75:06 music loud if I wanted to I could play
75:08 the Atari 2600 if I wanted to I could go
75:10 draw if I wanted to I could walk over to
75:12 my grandmother's if I wanted to hang out
75:14 my friends I could drag my motorcycle
75:15 I'll pop the garage door kick start that
75:18 baby and go ride for two hours nobody
75:21 was supervising me all right well
75:25 Michael didn't have that lifestyle and I
75:29 can't imagine having all my childhood
75:30 filled with business as much as it might
75:34 have been Fame and all that kind of
75:36 stuff you still don't have your
75:38 childhood so you're a little whacked in
75:39 the head
75:41 no again my only
75:44 critique that you know keeps a little
75:48 bit of my you know thread in the sweater
75:50 pulled open is this holding hands with
75:53 the bullies and you know there was a
75:56 claim by one of the mothers that said
75:58 that he tried to make sure that the
76:00 mother made sure that the son would hold
76:03 his hand I remember my daughter
76:06 we had a strict policy when you cross
76:09 the street he had to hold my hand and it
76:12 wasn't necessarily this bonding thing
76:14 between you know father and daughter it
76:17 was if there's a car coming something
76:19 crazy happens I got the ability to yank
76:22 you out of the way to take the hit and
76:24 so did you get in the head right and my
76:26 kid always respected that but she wanted
76:28 her independence it was amazing she
76:31 didn't want to hold my hand after a
76:32 certain point and it wasn't a you know
76:34 any offense that I needed to take it was
76:36 just she was gaining her independence
76:38 she want to build across the street
76:40 without being supervised okay I don't
76:47 know why he holds kids hands
76:48 you know like incessantly you know all
76:50 this there's tons of video of him and
76:52 Neverland being filmed holding these
76:55 kids hands all these shots of things now
76:58 maybe if he's getting out of a car and
77:00 there's a crazy mob outside I understand
77:02 he's trying to make sure just like me
77:03 with my daughter hey I'm gonna grab your
77:06 hand because we're not gonna lose you in
77:08 this crowd they'll eat you alive you
77:09 could die
77:10 I could see him having that opinion but
77:13 Neverland they're completely safe you
77:16 own the place
77:16 ain't no one touching kids in that place
77:20 it's a controlled environment now one
77:24 thing I tried to do and I think I can
77:27 say for all the footage that I've seen
77:30 and there's thousands of hours out there
77:32 so I haven't seen it all my concern
77:35 which is why I paid attention the first
77:37 time i watch the show which is why when
77:39 a friend disagree with me that this was
77:41 the case I got frustrated and watched it
77:44 again and confirmed I wasn't crazy was
77:48 that if Wade and James got together with
77:52 the same attorney
77:53 which is what occurred and they simply
77:56 sink their still
77:58 Cacique 'we can go first right
78:01 'we can go first make up anything he
78:03 wants he could duplicate someone else's
78:05 court filing to make it seem legit one
78:09 of the kids was not the either one of
78:11 these kids i forgot this kid's name i
78:13 don't think it was the jordan chandler
78:14 good like a second kid did interview and
78:18 on the cameras they put the documentary
78:19 where the kid was talking about the
78:21 things they did between the two of them
78:24 michael and this kid you know again i
78:29 don't want to make sure i don't want to
78:31 say that you know i know for a fact that
78:35 any of this didn't or did did or didn't
78:37 happen i wasn't there i don't know but
78:40 you could easily harvest everything that
78:42 had ever been said if everything if
78:44 everything's been filed into discovery
78:46 it's a matter of public record or
78:48 what-have-you you sink your story to add
78:50 legitimacy to it but if these two guys
78:52 got together and sync their stories then
78:57 this evidence lacking a 45 well sorry
79:03 about an hour and a half of the second
79:05 show leaving Neverland the part to it
79:09 would seem like because the two of them
79:11 are saying the same exact thing in very
79:13 graphic things that this has to be true
79:16 I fell for that too without thinking it
79:19 through without thinking it like maybe
79:20 these kids sink their stories I don't
79:23 know if they did or didn't last thing I
79:25 want to do is personally punch out of
79:27 this life having given someone a free
79:31 pass that did do all these things it was
79:35 really interesting to is there's a
79:36 channel on YouTube called I I am NOT
79:40 norm or something like that it's a
79:42 channel dedicated to Norm Macdonald the
79:44 comedian who was on Saturday Night Live
79:46 who ended up getting the news gig and he
79:51 incessantly accused Michael Jackson of
79:54 being a pedophile over and over there's
79:56 a whole compilation reel of him doing
79:58 this in the 90s I mean it was savage and
80:02 in fact it went into the 2000s I believe
80:04 because when he started having his
80:06 children norm was making jokes about
80:08 Michael having sex with his own kids
80:11 so that could reveal two things one
80:17 Norm's got some massive data drop that
80:19 no one else has
80:20 including the sheriff's that you know
80:23 detain Michael and searches a state or
80:27 it's sort of a deep state takedown and
80:32 it's not that it's it's not organic from
80:35 nor McDonald like you saw daddy's
80:36 getting a paycheck for him some deep
80:38 state organization it's just it's
80:40 allowed to go on national television
80:41 because there's this there's this goal
80:43 of knocking him out of the picture
80:46 I remember when Michael Jackson got the
80:51 the rights to Beatles the whole Beatles
80:53 are half the Beatles collection or
80:55 something like a big chunk of the
80:56 Beatles collection I remember people
80:58 being racially upset about that just in
81:02 passing none of my close friends but
81:04 just people that I heard talk about it
81:05 and it was like oh that's interesting
81:08 why guys can own all the black music but
81:10 once a black guy owns some of the white
81:12 music ooh big problem hey don't put it
81:15 up for sale if you don't want someone to
81:17 buy it that's my advice
81:20 but now let's dive back in just to be
81:23 sort of fair with this whole thing
81:28 rewatching the documentary my big
81:32 question that remains again is the
81:35 reaction that you see from at least some
81:37 of the relatives again unfortunately for
81:42 the safe Chuck's because they have such
81:44 a financial problem potentially I mean
81:49 this woman was in the house she looked
81:51 very well-dressed the house looked great
81:52 from the couple angles that they shot it
81:54 from you didn't you didn't get the sense
81:56 that they had any financial issues but
81:59 it would seem that people diving into
82:01 Wade's personal life and I wouldn't wish
82:03 that on anybody necessarily that they do
82:06 have some serious financial problems
82:09 I don't know personally just repeating
82:11 accusations from other people supposedly
82:14 evidence of the people have uncovered so
82:17 let's subtract out of the equation
82:20 at least save Chuck's mom she may be
82:25 telling the truth but there's a story
82:28 about Wade coming out to his brother
82:31 because his brother said that his wife
82:34 their there outside to set the scene
82:37 they're outside it's Wade his wife and
82:39 his brother and they're at a eating area
82:45 where there's a bunch of like food
82:48 trucks and I guess they've ordered their
82:51 food but the brother came up to Wade and
82:52 said you know my wife had a dream last
82:54 night that you confessed that Michael
82:56 Jackson actually touched you and this is
82:59 supposedly the golden moment where Wade
83:01 finally just said it's true and his
83:06 brother tells the story and because his
83:11 brother was sort of you know I wouldn't
83:14 say he was estranged from the family but
83:16 he was more on the father's side until
83:18 the father passed away and it was
83:19 literally when the the brother left
83:23 Australia to join his family in LA that
83:28 his father went into his house and hung
83:32 himself I mean it's just brutal
83:36 it's the brutal fact about what happened
83:39 and you know of course his brother's
83:42 devastated because kind of you know how
83:44 could you not feel that you're sort of
83:45 responsible for that action regardless
83:48 if your father had mental issues or not
83:49 it's a it's a huge deal I have all the
83:52 empathy and the sympathy in the world
83:54 for the family experiencing that because
83:56 it did occur but it's his reaction and
84:01 it's his wife's reaction Wade's wife
84:06 that seems like the most legitimate
84:10 filming of people that have heard
84:12 something that is just horrific because
84:15 as it's portrayed in the documentary the
84:18 Wade had told them up to that point that
84:20 he never got touched and then all
84:23 Sonny's flipping his story and of course
84:25 they're confiding in Wade to tell them
84:28 the truth because their loved ones are
84:30 the closest people in his life including
84:32 his mom right
84:35 so if this is a hoax and Wade and James
84:41 are simply trying to to gain financial
84:49 security in the later in life and of
84:51 course there was this part of one of
84:53 these documentaries there is a an email
84:57 or a message or something that Wade has
84:59 that has been validated as Wade left
85:01 this message and he wrote these words
85:03 down that he said that he was going to
85:07 get his prior to this whole thing coming
85:11 out this was something presented to
85:15 brilliant
85:16 yeah brandy Jackson right the the niece
85:19 who dated wait for 10 years and so she
85:23 said this looked really suspect yeah it
85:26 doesn't seem like it's someone saying
85:29 well I was molested and I am going to
85:33 get mine I'm gonna get payback for this
85:35 I'm no longer gonna go through the PTSD
85:38 that was created by this event that
85:40 would have been a more legit statement
85:42 to make so the question is did these two
85:47 gentlemen collude through their attorney
85:50 for this billion-dollar case and again
85:53 the number I saw was one point six two
85:55 it kept ratcheting up as they added
85:57 their own you know added the two of them
85:59 together but I've heard like three
86:01 different numbers tonight but it's
86:03 always over a billion again the case was
86:05 thrown out but did Wade lie to his
86:08 brother did weigh lied to his wife and
86:12 thus to his mother creating what looked
86:17 like extremely legitimate trauma because
86:21 his brother thought this whole Michael
86:23 Jackson obsession was already overboard
86:26 that it had damaged their family it
86:28 resulted in a divorce and potentially
86:30 really technically at least technically
86:33 in his father feeling so isolated with
86:38 his other bipolar conditions that he
86:40 hung himself I don't know about you
86:45 if someone is lying to their family
86:47 members like that and their family
86:49 members aren't in on this thing I can
86:52 only tell you I wouldn't stand in front
86:53 of waste brother and accuse him of that
86:55 he probably kicked my ass
86:56 ten ways to Sunday then that's pretty
87:01 damn devious wouldn't you say if you're
87:04 someone who's a profiler and you build
87:08 profiles on people's behaviors okay what
87:12 you would have to do in order to tell
87:16 such a gigantic lie to your family to
87:19 get them to go along with this and to
87:21 seemed very genuine in a documentary my
87:23 god yeah I don't know how the family's
87:26 process all of these other debunking
87:29 facts do they simply say well they're
87:31 just seeing what they want to see this
87:33 really did occur or are I mean everyone
87:37 could benefit from it financially that's
87:39 the tough thing so there's a motive
87:41 you could you could establish a motive
87:43 to say well I don't know about way
87:45 giving his brother money I suppose if
87:47 you had hundreds of millions of dollars
87:49 because this one billion dollar-plus
87:51 lawsuit maybe settles down to like an
87:54 eight hundred million dollar settlement
87:55 couldn't you give your brother ten
87:57 million and so potentially we're saying
88:01 that if they're in on it they're being
88:03 bought off they've all agreed to do this
88:08 they both seem to claim the same exact
88:11 epiphany
88:12 they said they when they had their
88:14 children this is when it really hit them
88:16 of what happened to them when they were
88:18 older and when his wife Wade's wife
88:20 names I can't remember she was saying
88:24 you know I needed to find out my husband
88:28 had tendencies both both wife's actually
88:31 said this do you have tendencies towards
88:33 our child both um had sons do you have a
88:36 tendency towards our child to touch them
88:39 because you were touched and of course
88:41 they're like absolutely not no way now
88:43 if they weren't touched be very easy to
88:46 say no absolutely not because there's
88:48 nothing that ever happened to you in the
88:49 first place now here's where we're gonna
88:53 close this thing off
88:57 this leaving Neverland special this
89:01 two-part for ours thing that HBO put out
89:05 there is resulting in michael jackson's
89:09 catalog being turned off in certain
89:11 radio stations the damage isn't
89:14 conclusive yet because they're still
89:16 deciding what to do more stations could
89:18 tend to potentially pull him off the
89:20 airwaves and it could continue to
89:22 cascade into damages that would be worth
89:26 billions of dollars
89:28 what if iTunes and Google Play and every
89:31 place that sold Michael Jackson music
89:33 simply said we can't sell his music
89:35 anymore regardless if albums were made
89:38 before any of this ever was even accused
89:40 of existing like I said you know we're
89:43 talking about at least getting to
89:44 thriller before any of those accusations
89:46 or even rumored to have occurred so you
89:49 could keep all the Jackson 5 stuff off
89:51 the wall and thriller but around you
89:54 know I don't remember if the song if the
89:56 album is called bad or I'm bad but it's
89:58 the bad series Disney hired Michael
90:02 Jackson to do the Captain EO thing
90:04 directed by George Lucas
90:05 what they gonna pull that it goes I
90:09 think it's guardians a galaxy right now
90:10 and where that show used to exist in
90:11 Disneyland but maybe it's still playing
90:13 somewhere in the world so it's a
90:14 brilliant piece they brought it back and
90:17 I was so happy because they got rid of
90:19 Captain EO they brought it back it's
90:21 just it's just fantastic it's it's great
90:24 George Lucas work it's phenomenal
90:27 Michael Jackson II get to see Michael
90:29 Jackson 3d and he's he was a fabulous
90:31 actor you know but now if this is all
90:36 easily penetrated by all these debunking
90:39 videos well imagine the power of a
90:42 family with billions coming in every
90:46 year you hire the best law firm in the
90:50 world maybe two or three but at least
90:53 one and you take all these
90:56 inconsistencies from the documentary and
91:00 you countersue you countersue so hard
91:05 that HBO is owned by the Jackson family
91:08 now
91:10 you countersue the Robson family the
91:15 [Music]
91:17 safe Chuck family the attorneys that
91:21 supported them
91:23 anyone who's remotely responsible for
91:28 diminishing the character and the
91:30 franchise value of Michael Jackson would
91:33 that be a logical next step now I've
91:35 read articles that said before this
91:37 thing released that they did threaten
91:39 how the HBO excuse me who said Hollywood
91:42 HBO with lawsuits if they release this
91:45 thing okay
91:47 I've been around those scenarios before
91:49 on my end of the game and I know that
91:52 they do incredible due diligence with
91:56 their law firms to say well how could
91:58 they come after us and if we're lying we
92:02 know what lies we told so is there some
92:07 indemnity clause where they go well it's
92:11 really gonna fall back on the Robson
92:13 family and the safe Chuck family because
92:15 they're the ones on the video making the
92:16 accusations we're just filming it or
92:19 framing the evidence against Michael
92:22 Jackson are they guilty for omitting all
92:26 the things that I mentioned and the
92:28 countless things I didn't mention that
92:30 the the other videos seem to talk about
92:36 it's gonna be an interesting 2019 in
92:38 regards to this case so I'm making this
92:42 special report with an overwhelming bias
92:46 for Michael Jackson's potential
92:48 innocence because the other one is
92:51 overwhelmingly more in favor the
92:53 documentary but I did you know use the
92:58 allegation allegedly in the first
93:01 special because I realize well these are
93:05 allegations they haven't gone to a court
93:08 of law and a court of law you can't
93:11 change your story
93:12 over and over and over again you can't
93:15 make claims about riding on a train that
93:18 doesn't exist you can't make claims
93:20 about staying with Michael Jackson while
93:21 your family goes to the
93:23 Grand Canyon when you actually did go to
93:25 the Grand Canyon if if Brandi Jackson
93:29 was brought into this new trial let's
93:31 just say they have a new trial and
93:32 they're like gonna sue the crap out of
93:33 all these people well imagine a jury
93:36 listening to that story all you dated
93:39 his niece for ten years I mean obviously
93:41 he didn't romantically did her when she
93:43 was a minor and you were a minor but
93:44 eventually when you guys crossed that
93:46 threshold where I guess you can be
93:47 intimate with each other and no one's
93:48 gonna say anything I mean if if they met
93:51 when he was 9 or 7 I guess you could say
93:55 I'm not sure when it that relationship
93:58 took place but you know where it started
94:00 she said 10 years so it could have been
94:01 she was 17 she was 19 when it ended I
94:05 think he said it was 19 when it ended
94:08 but I could have that wrong wouldn't
94:10 that change people's opinions about this
94:12 whole molestation thing again if a guy's
94:16 a predator and a pedophile and he wants
94:19 you all to himself
94:20 why would he hook you up why would
94:22 Michael just say I you know I I couldn't
94:26 set up the things she's got to go to
94:27 school she's got other things she's got
94:29 a boyfriend or whatever you just make up
94:31 whatever excuse you can to a little kid
94:33 and he has his heart broken for maybe a
94:35 week or two and then he realizes I'm in
94:37 Neverland and I don't care Michael
94:41 definitely thought for the last several
94:43 years of his life they were gonna try to
94:47 kill him he refused to go to a hospital
94:50 because he thought the hospital would
94:51 try to kill him
94:52 Dick Gregory was a family friend Dick
94:56 Gregory is an extremely interesting dude
95:00 he has been used to disseminate things
95:04 like the footage of Kennedy being shot
95:07 in his car back in 63 he's one of the
95:12 first black comedians to be on
95:13 television on the Playboy channel
95:14 because Hugh Hefner wanted to show that
95:19 the world has multiple colors and when
95:21 the network said we won't put that guy
95:22 on TV said well screw you can't have my
95:24 show so they're going okay I let him on
95:27 TV I've seen dick talk about a lot of
95:31 amazing things the artist known as
95:33 Prince
95:35 sought out lots of evidence from Dick
95:38 Gregory and I will say that dick is very
95:40 live and lucid and seems to have a lot
95:43 of interesting resources there was a
95:45 point when the trial concluded literally
95:49 the last day when he was acquitted dick
95:52 came over to visit Michael at the court
95:54 followed him home realized he looked
95:56 very unhealthy
95:58 he said that Michael told him he goes
96:01 they're trying to kill me he says well
96:03 dude when's the last time you eaten he
96:05 says they're gonna poison me as well the
96:07 ones I send me drink water cuz they're
96:10 gonna poison me this is well look I was
96:13 getting a car and go to the hospital he
96:15 said no they're gonna kill me he said
96:17 we'll keep fine we're gonna drive to San
96:19 Francisco and we're gonna pull into a
96:20 hospital randomly they won't know you're
96:23 coming and so we agreed to that and they
96:27 took him to San Francisco and I guess
96:28 before they got that quite into the city
96:30 limits or whatever he said that they
96:32 finally found a hospital pulled him in
96:34 there
96:34 got him on an IV and he was an IV for
96:39 you know like 12 hours or something like
96:41 that and the doctors came to dick and
96:43 said look if you hadn't brought him in
96:45 here he would have died in a couple days
96:47 he was so dehydrated he was at literally
96:50 a life-threatening level so when we see
96:54 Michael really emaciated at the court
96:56 especially he was leaving he's walking
96:57 real slow and Jose there and all the
96:59 bodyguards are there lifting amount
97:01 according to dick that was a very very
97:03 real thing well like I said before just
97:09 in closing here again I think there's
97:12 substantial evidence that there was some
97:16 profiteering with his death I don't
97:20 believe for an instant that Michael
97:21 would grab you know wasn't it pro
97:26 Fennell like that's the name of the drug
97:27 whatever it was he was using to sleep
97:30 that he would just randomly inject
97:33 himself with some of that stuff oh the
97:35 doctor said I only need you know 20 cc's
97:38 and I'm just gonna get myself 50 cuz you
97:40 know I just feel like really getting to
97:42 bed tonight I just don't buy that and
97:44 maybe some of you who might see this and
97:47 you get to the end of this
97:49 again when I was watching live news the
97:52 day that Michael Jackson died and for
97:54 the next couple days they did say that
97:56 the surveillance footage of his house
97:58 the external cameras to the house he was
98:00 renting had at least two individuals
98:03 running away from the window - Michael
98:05 Jackson's room that they had that own
98:07 video and the LAPD lost the video maybe
98:13 you guys remember that maybe it's a
98:14 Mandela effect
98:15 icers hell sure as hell would not have
98:17 made that up give me a break
98:19 who the hell would make something like
98:20 that up not me
98:24 so they take him down tried to take him
98:28 down in two cases he wins in the end
98:31 they kill him and ten years later
98:33 there's this hit piece on him that is
98:36 unbelievable for me the only two people
98:39 that could really be lying on camera
98:41 from a likelihood standpoint would be
98:44 Wade and James if they if they are lying
98:47 at all all right I hate to accuse two
98:49 people that are telling the truth that
98:50 their line that would be a big faux pas
98:53 my part but then again I need their
98:54 stories to not change and not contradict
98:57 well-known facts about reality I do
99:02 believe that for now without further
99:06 evidence that the family members are
99:08 simply being told this and it's gonna be
99:12 another secret that's kept for the rest
99:14 of the lives now I do I think that these
99:15 guys could lie like this and keep the
99:17 secret from their from their loved ones
99:19 forever no I don't think they can go to
99:22 their grave lying about Michael Jackson
99:24 in this room
99:25 so either the unthinkable is that you
99:31 know we always talk about the moon
99:32 missions on this show you're talking
99:34 about
99:34 two mothers a sister a brother and two
99:40 wives all faking this on camera and all
99:45 being able to withdraw or sorry yeah
99:48 with the draw from their insides this
99:50 amazing emotional reaction now these
99:55 guys are being accused of things that
99:57 they never said then they need to defend
99:58 the other side of the game
100:00 like you know did you go to the Grand
100:03 Canyon not did you ride on a train when
100:05 it didn't exist did you get these things
100:07 wrong why are you getting these things
100:08 wrong I guess they can defend themselves
100:12 they should if you never hear from these
100:15 guys again and that stuff is true then
100:18 we probably can conclude this whole
100:20 thing as a fabrication I know we all
100:24 love Michael Jackson I love his music I
100:28 don't know the guy never knew the guy it
100:30 was never close to the guy and so I
100:33 can't claim anything else other than
100:35 just liking the byproduct of his life
100:37 and that could be deceiving you know you
100:41 know there's plenty of people that have
100:44 created amazing things that you admire
100:45 but they turn out to be real jerks in
100:47 life it happens it does I have seen
100:52 enough questionable behavior from these
100:55 gentlemen and financial peril and eat
101:00 both families that in lawsuits for
101:04 billions of dollars which I mean their
101:07 attorney should have said what what law
101:09 firm is gonna take on this multi-billion
101:11 dollar lawsuit presented to a court and
101:13 not know that there's a statute of
101:15 limitations for that I've seen an
101:18 attorney once because I got injured
101:21 because of something that you know
101:23 someone shipped something to my house
101:25 and they didn't have the proper
101:26 equipment to get it off the truck and I
101:28 helped lift this thing off the crush
101:30 truck and it crushed one of my vertebrae
101:33 in my back I'm better now but it took
101:36 you know a couple years to get over that
101:37 one so an attorney and the guy says well
101:39 you've got you know I think he told me
101:42 like I had four years to two to four
101:44 years he said you know after two it's
101:45 gonna look bad you know you're not
101:47 saying anything he sent me off to some
101:49 you know physical therapy place and it
101:52 really worked and so I just went on with
101:55 my life you know but my attorney knew
101:58 what was capable of being charged in a
102:01 court of law and you mean to tell me
102:03 these guys with billion-dollar appetites
102:05 don't know the law what the hell are
102:08 they doing putting this case against the
102:10 Jackson family do they think the family
102:12 was just gonna
102:13 overlook the law and just pay him off
102:16 the idea was to say in my opinion the
102:19 only strategy that could possibly be
102:21 asserted would be well we know there's a
102:24 statute of limitations against this case
102:26 but we're threatening you we're gonna
102:29 collude together whether we're telling
102:32 the truth or not we're gonna combine our
102:34 efforts and we're gonna accuse your
102:37 number one asset Michael of doing this
102:41 to us
102:41 and it's gonna impact you and it's gonna
102:44 be our word against your word and
102:46 because I can't even take it into court
102:48 meaning these two guys you're gonna have
102:51 to fight off my accusations if I were
102:55 the Jackson family and these other
102:56 active these other inconsistencies are
102:58 true but they are actually lying I would
103:01 sue them I would sue them to the point
103:04 where their current and financial
103:06 problems will pale in comparison to
103:09 what's going to happen there's damages
103:13 there's damages going on right now
103:18 anyway
103:19 starting to loop on myself so for those
103:22 of you
103:23 we felt like I misrepresented the
103:26 counter facts well it's a process this
103:28 thing is brand-new this thing is fresh
103:30 now some of you been following this case
103:32 since the first TV appearance by Wade
103:36 back in nineteen twenty thirteen and you
103:37 think this is all old news well that's
103:40 great I didn't see that stuff I don't
103:43 obsess on people I could I could think
103:46 that someone was like a you know I could
103:49 think Rod Serling is the best TV writer
103:51 to ever live but it would be a freak of
103:53 nature that I would go well let me look
103:55 up when he was born and who his parents
103:57 are and who his kids are I don't do that
104:00 I just have no interest in that I just
104:02 am interested in the byproduct now
104:04 sometimes I want to know how how and why
104:06 someone tics I might dig a little bit
104:07 what's that gonna do for me I'm not them
104:10 I didn't have their experiences in life
104:12 so it's not of any real value to me
104:15 method is different how did you learn
104:17 how to write or do you how to did you
104:19 write that's a little bit different but
104:21 I never wanted to be Michael Jackson as
104:23 an artist I just wanted to listen to his
104:26 stuff
104:27 praying he would always come out with a
104:28 new tune and he did until the end anyway
104:34 I know you feel me for those of you who
104:37 have not been to deep thoughts radio.com
104:39 please go there's audio and video a
104:42 locked facebook group a twitter account
104:43 and a patreon page those of you are not
104:47 you know used to the show it doesn't
104:50 cover anything like this
104:51 usually this is factoid stuff about real
104:54 people in the real world and I seldom
104:56 really get this deep into that kind of
104:58 thing so you may or may not have any
105:01 interest in the rest of the show but
105:03 thanks for stopping by if you can hear
105:05 the sound of my voice and you're never
105:06 seen before
