00:29 welcome back to dpi ladies and gentlemen
00:33 on this brisk April 14th morning now you
00:40 guys know I record these and then I
00:42 release them sometimes many weeks later
00:45 sometimes some months later so maybe
00:48 I'll just start saying the date in the
00:50 beginning and that walnut whoa I won't
00:51 have to score the front credit with it
00:54 how many of you remember the old movie
00:58 called the secret how many of you
01:02 remember the movie before that called
01:05 what the bleep do we know for those of
01:10 you who didn't saw see either the secret
01:14 was the last one to be released and it
01:20 starts off by telling you that what if
01:24 the elite of the world understood that
01:29 projecting what you want to have happen
01:31 in this universe is the way to get it
01:33 done but a positive rum you simply will
01:38 it and through Law of Attraction it
01:40 happens okay now the secret was really
01:45 about the universe sort of obeying your
01:50 law of attraction and I very much
01:53 believe in this not because the wishful
01:55 thinking or crystal hugging or that kind
01:57 of stuff but we're gonna get we're gonna
01:59 get into this what the bleep do we know
02:04 was at a much more detailed scientific
02:09 level talking about things like
02:11 neuropeptides
02:12 but what the bleep do we know was more
02:15 focused on you and yourself crafting a
02:20 vision of your world and then becoming
02:23 that more on a personal level than
02:25 controlling the outside world but both
02:29 were sort of pushing towards the same
02:31 end we control many aspects of the
02:36 universe now was either my
02:41 existentialism episode or it was on my
02:45 Law of Attraction video where I opened
02:50 with the phrase what if the greatest
02:51 secret in the universe is that you
02:53 control it if you watch my other episode
02:58 on consensus reality and that's a that's
03:02 a more homogeneous socialistic model our
03:06 social model I should say excuse me of
03:07 the theory which is this world and
03:11 everything in it there's an amalgamation
03:14 of all of our consciousness put together
03:17 and it's the average mean of where we
03:19 are in the universe there's a lot of
03:23 things that suggest that as well we're
03:24 gonna get into this but here's what's
03:27 interesting about my own experience with
03:29 what the bleep did we know and the
03:31 secret it never occurred to me until
03:35 just recently and this is probably
03:38 foolish on my part what can be used for
03:44 good can be used for evil but now some
03:50 of you might think well now wait a
03:52 minute what are you saying here that the
03:54 world goes bad because there's more bad
03:56 people than good people mm-hmm but what
04:02 if I have no exact proof of this but
04:07 there are certain things that I've
04:08 mentioned in previous episodes and those
04:10 of you are hardcore listeners this is
04:11 going to be a beautiful like episode
04:14 that surmises tons of previous episodes
04:17 along these lines now some people think
04:22 I mean quite literally that they're
04:24 witches and that they can hold a little
04:25 seance in a basement sacrifice some poor
04:28 kid ripped off by the Clinton Foundation
04:31 out of Haiti and their little ritual
04:34 with all the you know worms wort and you
04:37 know frogs tails can change the world to
04:40 be however they want not convinced
04:44 myself but I don't think you need need
04:48 that kind of stuff if what we think is
04:53 going to happen is all it takes to make
04:57 it happen
04:58 whether it be we feel like something
05:01 Bad's gonna happen and then something
05:02 bad manifests out of our collective
05:04 consciousness but we don't know what it
05:07 is then it's still very effective isn't
05:11 it Marshall McLuhan as I've mentioned
05:15 several times because I want you to be
05:17 able to mention it one of my secrets of
05:21 making episodes is to strategically
05:22 repeat things that I'm not hearing from
05:24 the public so that you can start to have
05:27 that as muscle memory not trying to
05:29 brainwash it because I don't think
05:30 you're gonna repeat anything you don't
05:32 believe and I think that all of you who
05:35 are hardcore listeners you do on
05:36 research and you make up your own mind
05:38 I'm merely a presentation of
05:42 possibilities the Marshall McLuhan
05:47 invented the word as used today called
05:50 media as the Rastafarian C media I love
05:57 that he said that it's more important to
06:02 recognize how you're getting information
06:07 versus the information that you actually
06:09 get
06:12 and I think what he was trying to say
06:14 because in his lifetime this dude lived
06:15 like 99 years or something 100 years or
06:18 something man that you live forever
06:20 he was an American philosopher his
06:24 counterpart was the Canadian Frenchman
06:26 Jean Baudrillard
06:27 both amazing men both amazing thinkers
06:31 but Marshall McLuhan saw and he was born
06:35 in the I believe in the era he may have
06:37 actually been born prior to the radio
06:40 one of the greatest interviews you can
06:42 read from Marshall and buckle up baby if
06:44 you think you've got a intellectual mind
06:46 the stuff I always talk about Jumbo's
06:49 real arts little teeny tiny books I mean
06:52 they're teeny tiny one page is like a
06:54 seven-course meal and they're big dishes
06:56 okay Marshall McLuhan same exact thing
06:59 but his 1968 Playboy interview which you
07:02 can see online is just mind-blowing
07:06 you have to read it if you care about
07:09 anything I'm saying today but he sees
07:13 the news go from a newspaper right at
07:17 the cusp of like massive yellow
07:19 journalism conversion then he sees the
07:22 radio and he's watching he's a thinker
07:26 talk about a deep thinker if he made a
07:28 show would be the deepest thoughts radio
07:35 and then he sees television and he sees
07:38 movies overlaid on top of all that he
07:42 watched war propaganda movies do their
07:44 thing he watched commercials manipulate
07:46 people and so he understood that the
07:49 more realistic the media becomes the
07:53 more dangerous it is to indoctrinate men
07:56 we all know this now look a deep fake I
08:01 just reached the what was it
08:05 Bill Hader I guess his name right
08:09 he's the impersonator it used to be on
08:11 SNL but he was on the Conan O'Brien show
08:13 and he impersonates Arnold
08:15 Schwarzenegger and they did a deep fake
08:17 switch on him that every time he started
08:19 the impersonation I've honest what
08:21 singer they did the most a meticulous
08:23 deep fake of his face turning into
08:25 Schwarzenegger I mean it looked like he
08:26 was just stretching his face it's crazy
08:28 but it was the deep fake it was so well
08:32 done that even with my background I
08:34 didn't someone clicked on the video
08:35 before I got to see the title and you
08:37 can't see the title after it starts
08:38 playing on the TV I thought he was
08:40 torquing his face like like Jim Carrey
08:42 cuz Hader is that that talented I just
08:45 thought oh my God look he looks like him
08:47 plus it makes him look older and more
08:49 regal and so I was thinking hey maybe
08:52 his face is getting different you know
08:54 no it was deep fake so let's go back to
08:58 the beginning of this episode if we
09:02 control the universe within our own
09:04 sphere of influence right then all we
09:08 need to do is quarantine ourselves from
09:10 outer contributions and then think how
09:14 we want our universe to go most of us
09:16 can't do it because it's a lot to think
09:18 about I mean right now I'm sitting
09:21 outside if I wanted it to snow well how
09:24 do I even have that thought you know
09:26 it's like the dude in American Gods I
09:29 mean do I just conceive of snowflakes
09:32 popping out of nowhere probably don't
09:34 know but most of us don't live like
09:38 Hermits most of us have circles of
09:41 influence
09:43 and so because that's the case when
09:46 we're mixing with everybody else you
09:49 know right now
09:51 I have a memory of every place I've ever
09:54 been probably past the age of seven
09:57 meticulous like I know where the
10:00 bedrooms were you know what the houses
10:02 look like my hometown looks like with
10:04 the little couple towns in Massachusetts
10:06 I lived in an Albuquerque where I've
10:08 been before all these other places
10:10 I still remember them and so in my mind
10:12 I'm inserting them into my reality as
10:15 the way they were with last I saw them
10:19 but there's also people living there
10:21 changing it making decisions to improve
10:24 things or leave things alone and so my
10:27 consciousness would be mixing with air
10:29 consciousness to the degree they changed
10:32 something maybe I'm being influenced
10:34 without even thinking about it and we
10:37 make another kind of esoteric analogy
10:40 here for those of you are familiar with
10:42 remote viewing and I did an episode on
10:43 if you'd care to dive into it
10:47 the idea is that an individual could be
10:48 put into a room being give their given
10:50 longitude and latitude coordinates and
10:53 without ever being there they can
10:55 meditate and see it which would be sort
10:58 of a god-like I from a videogame looking
11:00 down on a map and then drawing what they
11:03 see all the way to the point where they
11:05 were said to be able to look at writing
11:07 on a piece of paper inside of an
11:08 envelope
11:08 clearing around the world or even the
11:10 more coast-to-coast versions they can
11:13 see planets from you know way out there
11:15 and they in the universe okay what if
11:23 that's all we're doing when we think
11:25 about past places we're looking down on
11:28 them and so whatever they decide to make
11:33 it as the way we see it
11:36 they're architecting it where they are
11:38 because they're closer to it in
11:39 proximity and all I'm doing is staring
11:41 down into their consciousness and seeing
11:43 my hometown however it is okay
11:48 so let's create a fake little study and
11:51 our deep thoughts college we want to
11:54 explore this and so we get some
11:57 volunteers to spend perhaps maybe an
12:00 extended period of time perhaps six
12:01 months we're gonna make a chill you know
12:04 reality show pad for them everything
12:07 they need everyone's pre-qualified to
12:09 get along cuz we're all deep thoughts
12:12 radio people and they agree to be
12:18 influenced and so what we're gonna do is
12:23 say you can have the news feed just to
12:27 kind of keep yourself to entertain while
12:29 you're in this quarantine but what we
12:30 don't tell them is that the news is
12:32 completely fake we are making it in
12:35 another studio and so we create either
12:41 positive Russian news or a bunch of
12:44 negative news we manipulate like the old
12:48 video game from EA we made called
12:49 majestic where you signed up to have
12:52 your email your fax at the time your
12:55 cell phone will get called your home
12:57 phone will get called and we terrorized
12:59 you with a
13:01 sort of x-files scenario scheme really
13:05 existed
13:06 and then it was turned off was absolute
13:08 propaganda machine that we made it was
13:10 brilliant
13:11 utterly brilliant but we start messing
13:14 with everyone who signs up for six
13:15 months and to make sure we don't really
13:19 get anyone damaged maybe we go for the
13:21 positive side of things just to see what
13:24 happens
13:26 when they come out in six months we see
13:30 what kind of people they are we see what
13:32 they've done with a bunch of resources
13:33 that we put in in their space maybe they
13:36 all become so extremely happy that they
13:38 all be become exactly who they want to
13:40 be
13:42 we put art and music in there and just
13:47 everything every single hobby you could
13:49 possibly have is in there to keep them
13:51 beautifully entertained and because we
13:56 inject you know positive positivity in
13:58 the room it's all good but let's say we
14:01 have two other chambers that are doing
14:02 the exact same thing in one case it's
14:05 the control group we do nothing to them
14:07 we feed them real news real information
14:12 maybe we asked asked them to limit their
14:16 communications with actual individuals
14:18 and loved ones on the outside just to
14:19 keep it controlled but in the other one
14:22 we do like that old Twilight Zone
14:25 episode with a guy lured everyone and
14:26 the bomb shelter where he had rigged a
14:29 fake nuclear bomb going off outside
14:31 because he wanted to torture three
14:33 people that tortured him when he was
14:34 young however we do it we create some
14:39 sort of catastrophe maybe a pandemic
14:43 would be nice because then you know no
14:46 it's not nice but it's like it's not
14:47 like there's a nuclear holocaust outside
14:49 but they're like a you know I'm so glad
14:51 I'm in this chamber here because I'm
14:54 extra safe I just happen to be in here
14:56 when this thing spread but we just keep
15:00 feeding negativity and negativity in
15:02 there I'm willing to bet that after six
15:07 months
15:09 if they could even last that long
15:10 without trying to hurt each other you
15:13 might have the dark room where
15:14 everyone's in fetal positions stress to
15:18 the nines which would be unethical to
15:21 actually conduct that experiment the
15:25 positive folks we would probably have a
15:28 few albums we might have a bunch of
15:30 works of art maybe some inventions and
15:34 maybe a few marriages with some pregnant
15:37 people you know and the neutral group
15:39 well probably be just what we have today
15:43 I'm starting to suspect this is a much
15:47 deeper than an involuntary system
15:49 whereby humans just sit around and
15:51 create the universe now I'm always
15:55 mentioning you know no country for old
15:57 men as the theory that I understand
15:59 standards change music changes and so a
16:03 person from the past can feel very
16:05 alienated in the future and this used to
16:08 be the case from you know people who
16:11 grew up in really tumultuous times in
16:13 the United States entering an era that
16:16 is wonderful and they still feel like
16:19 the world is not theirs anymore and they
16:22 dislike it and they don't like the music
16:24 and they don't like the entertainment
16:26 all I have their kind of stuff when de
16:27 facto we've got you know cars instead of
16:31 horse and carriage we've got electric
16:33 appliances instead of having to wash
16:35 your clothes on a on a board we've got
16:37 radio we could transmit you know
16:39 entertainment but they still feel
16:43 alienated and upset with the way that
16:45 things changed well having sort of this
16:51 ritual that I have with older people
16:53 especially when I was young I have been
16:55 asking older people about their the
16:59 times when they grew up you know what
17:00 was it like when you were a kid and then
17:02 I file that away into the 40s 30s to 50s
17:05 the 60s et cetera now in every decade
17:10 that's around there's usually something
17:12 negative that occurs within that decade
17:15 in my
17:18 research the only decades that we have
17:21 of the 20th century we need the last
17:24 century where things were really
17:27 exploding probably was the 1920s because
17:31 the world war 1 had concluded no we did
17:33 have a Spanish flu that ended right
17:35 around the 1920 realm but the 20s were
17:39 pretty much okay until 29 when the stock
17:41 market crashed right so almost the whole
17:43 decade was was good the 47 World War one
17:47 the fifties had the Korean War plus the
17:49 nuke scare the sixties had Vietnam 70s
17:53 had half the Vietnam but the 80s were
17:55 clean the eighties were totally clean
17:58 and you know Britain had the Falkland
17:59 Islands thing we had iran-contra there's
18:02 always a scandal but it's nothing like a
18:04 world war the 90s
18:07 well almost clean we had Saddam Hussein
18:11 for the Americans but things got kind of
18:13 weird in the nineties right
18:15 the culture went super dark right after
18:17 that Iraq thing totally unrelated I
18:22 think but it seemed to have hatched an
18:25 agenda whereby things were being guided
18:32 towards a darker room the gang violence
18:36 in Los Angeles alone was was terrifying
18:42 I mean it was really an epidemic of
18:44 everyone freaky freaked out about
18:46 drive-by shootings and all kinds of
18:48 other stuff music really got dark the
18:52 white kids who had silver spoons in
18:54 their mouths from the point moment
18:56 they're born are trying to pretend like
18:57 they're poor and the kids in the ghettos
18:59 are trying to having just sort of
19:02 exposed a lot of the drug trade and the
19:04 ghettos from the 80s we're then suddenly
19:08 endorsing it as a method on how to live
19:11 those guns violence you know calling
19:14 each other's names and all this other
19:15 stuff not good
19:18 first decade of the 21st century we have
19:21 9/11 we have a war war on terror unknown
19:25 enemy a recession that was horrible and
19:30 then in the second decade of this
19:34 century we did really really well big
19:38 economic boost real estate boost and
19:41 then 2008 they basically blew a hole in
19:46 the bottom of the boat which we are
19:49 still reeling from today before this
19:51 latest catastrophe that's going on the
19:55 reason why I mention this is I think if
19:58 you pay attention to media all the way
20:01 back to say the 1910s you know Charlie
20:05 Chaplin's getting out there and making
20:06 movies
20:07 we have those in control because every
20:12 war we have to attribute to those in
20:14 control it passed the sixteenth
20:17 Amendment United States the clinic
20:18 killed Franz Ferdinand trying to get us
20:20 dragged into a world war the Roaring
20:23 Twenties we were again pretty good until
20:25 the crash of the stock market the 30s
20:27 they took all of our gold away got a
20:29 massive depression the 40s has half the
20:31 decades been worried about a World War
20:33 find the Pacific Rim of Japan Atlantic
20:36 rims with the Germans things look good
20:41 baby boomer happened after the war by
20:44 1954 poof were in the middle of this
20:47 Korean War now it's very easy for us to
20:50 simply say that there is no sort of law
20:57 of attraction in the universe because
20:58 everything I just mentioned to you was
21:00 heavily orchestrated and that would be
21:03 true that burns for Franz Ferdinand is
21:06 murdered Hitler is built up Theodore
21:10 Roosevelt's a shill Korean War was
21:14 started by the French they boogied out
21:17 of town and we're stuck with it
21:20 the indominus created by the french
21:22 boogie town we have to deal with it and
21:25 then other things happen right so Dan
21:30 was saying ask for permission to invade
21:31 Kuwait we say yes he doesn't the Saudis
21:33 get pissed then we have to go get him
21:35 out of there but we don't kill him
21:36 because we realized we did give him
21:38 permission to do it
21:39 and I think just in retrospect is a
21:43 small footnote you know it was said
21:46 several times that he was the CIA asset
21:48 and I think that if that's the case they
21:51 wanted to keep him in their back pocket
21:52 in case the Saudis got out of control
21:54 and they would simply have Saddam roll
21:56 over Saudi Arabia that's a cynical
21:59 thought but I don't put it past these
22:01 evil people to keep a bunch of people in
22:04 check by you know having everyone in
22:06 their back pocket 9/11 well give me a
22:10 break
22:10 it's an inside job beyond your wildest
22:12 dreams all the financial collapses we
22:16 have ever had ever
22:17 totally and a thousand percent
22:19 orchestrated since the 16th amendment
22:22 was falsely ratified in 1913
22:26 but now here's the thing we have a
22:32 couple things happening which is very
22:34 interesting
22:36 now during almost every single crisis
22:39 say past the introduction of acid into
22:43 the mainstream about 63 the world was
22:50 behind or I should say sorry excuse me I
22:53 have to apologize for being an American
22:56 America was a hundred percent behind the
23:00 Korean War for dumb reasons okay you
23:04 know threat of communism blah blah blah
23:06 I mean yeah whatever I am glad that
23:10 least we saved South Korea but World War
23:14 two well whole planet was behind that
23:17 except for the Nazis and a few neutral
23:19 countries Japan had you know allied with
23:21 the Germans after the Nanking Massacre
23:24 and you know Germany was helping Japan
23:27 and certain certain methodologies of
23:31 endorsement but the most the world was
23:32 behind that you know defeating this
23:36 regime of the Third Reich and so there
23:41 are these major circumstances that occur
23:44 that create a polarization within the
23:47 society you note again up until the 60s
23:49 where people did soon researches said
23:52 what are we doing a Vietnam again you
23:54 know they didn't know the Gulf of Tonkin
23:56 incidents the two of them never occurred
23:58 they believed that that actually
23:59 occurred I'm pretty sure there was no
24:01 one within without sorry no one outside
24:04 the military that knew that that was
24:06 fake until much much later they knew
24:09 better than to send people over to die
24:11 for some bizarre little region of the
24:14 world that should have been left alone
24:15 to fight it out by themselves and I
24:19 don't think anyone can say that South
24:20 Korea wouldn't have survived without the
24:21 United States help at all I think they
24:23 could have easily have divided the two
24:25 do you never know today it wouldn't have
24:28 worked that way right
24:29 without South Korea having an ally North
24:32 Korea would roll over them in two
24:33 seconds I think all that kpop we
24:37 wouldn't be missing you know
24:40 we wouldn't have done themselves you
24:42 know I'd be bummer
24:43 but what I'm really talking about
24:46 because I want to acknowledge that in
24:47 case you guys make a valid point about
24:49 those you know induced situations which
24:52 do cause very very clear
24:55 cause-and-effect reaction equal and
24:59 opposite reaction effects to our lives
25:01 that are very negative anyone who loses
25:04 a family member in war could lecture us
25:07 about the realities of banker systems
25:10 creating Wars to create money borrowing
25:13 which is their leverage over us right
25:15 you know the more I hear about this
25:17 national debt thing it doesn't mean
25:20 anything to me anymore just you know
25:22 someone says well you know the national
25:24 debt they're trying to take advantage
25:25 they're trying to take control the
25:26 conversation through sort of this well
25:30 you know there's the boogeyman you know
25:32 you got to behave because of the
25:33 boogeyman is like that's in your brain
25:35 okay
25:36 now between individuals debt is very
25:38 real I don't know any other human being
25:41 money besides some employees that we all
25:44 got screwed when this dude screwed me a
25:46 bunch of money but other than that if I
25:49 borrow money from somebody I've always
25:51 paid it back always but there is a much
25:56 deeper sort of consciousness that we
26:00 carry within our minds in our heart and
26:03 I want to get this episode out during
26:05 our current ridiculous lockdown because
26:10 regardless of how much you're trying to
26:12 search for the truth or not search for
26:13 the truth there are sort of core
26:18 feelings we have in our chest about
26:21 whether or not we're living in a world
26:22 that is going to benefit us at some
26:24 point if we work hard or no matter how
26:27 hard we work nothing's ever going to
26:29 work out it's sort of your hope and
26:33 despair meter how much did you have
26:36 Veatch
26:38 now I think we have the choice to throw
26:41 away those paradigms in those metrics
26:43 and simply say we conquer our destinies
26:48 not other people but we conquer our
26:51 destinies that's all we do yeah yeah
26:53 yeah there's a war there's a pandemic
26:56 there's this latest scare thing going on
26:58 me not my problem if I can help I'll
27:01 help but I got to take care of number
27:04 one first and foremost and I can benefit
27:06 anyone in need better if I'm more
27:09 successful so what this gets down to if
27:14 this were true let's just go in that
27:16 route right away and my opinion we get
27:21 back to Marshall McLuhan's caution to
27:23 the world be careful what medium you use
27:27 to get information for any of you that
27:30 have been burned by a photoshopped photo
27:34 where they're trying to say you know
27:38 this person was at this particular
27:40 meeting when they weren't you went out
27:43 and told your friends you passed the
27:44 photograph around or whatever
27:47 and then you get burned and you're like
27:49 oh my god you know that wasn't true you
27:55 know what it's like the medium looks so
27:57 real to you that you passed it around
28:00 how many of you have seen a friend link
28:03 something in facebook where they're like
28:06 oh my god look at this this is amazing
28:08 and it's either UFO landing somewhere
28:11 not really landing but flying around or
28:13 it's the what was a camera this guy was
28:16 Norwegian or something the dude that
28:18 made the animation of the the theme park
28:21 with all the fake rides he did this
28:23 amazing CG where he just created these
28:27 amazing rides that were they didn't
28:29 exist in real life but it he moved it
28:32 just fast enough and it just slow enough
28:36 and just fast at the right speed that it
28:38 looked absolutely photo real I mean as
28:40 far as lighting is concerned and the
28:42 models they were perfect and I guess
28:46 that guy contacted Sid and they said
28:51 that he ended up working for Neil
28:52 Blomkamp's so that makes sense but you
28:55 see things and you pass it around like
28:56 it's real so what are our options if we
29:00 wanted to take measures
29:03 to better weed out information I just
29:07 had a chance to go through a ton of
29:09 comments on the Facebook I started in
29:10 the YouTube channel I apologize for not
29:13 getting back to you guys there's a bunch
29:14 of you that deserve responses
29:17 but here's what's most valuable to me
29:19 and there could be Shelly people in
29:21 there but no one's really claimed
29:24 anything outrageous so it seems very
29:26 believable but as you folks report in
29:30 from your area of the world it's very
29:35 enlightening to essentially have like a
29:39 slice of truth from a particular country
29:41 right you know in England we're doing
29:43 this and I live in this particular town
29:45 well I live in London and I live in you
29:47 know wherever Madrid Han over Rome Paris
29:51 whatever that's very valuable so I have
29:56 friends that are very stern very strong
30:00 they're like pillars and you could you
30:04 know it's like running up to them and
30:05 shouting in their face and they just
30:06 they just don't even move they don't you
30:08 don't even know if they have an emotion
30:10 and then I have friends where you could
30:15 just smile funny and they think the sky
30:17 is falling
30:18 Panik 24/7 man can't get out of it okay
30:23 so given our theory of creating the
30:28 universe for yourself the part of it has
30:30 to do with your perception of the
30:32 universe right you could see someone and
30:35 say oh my god it's the worst person on
30:37 planet earth what happens with Trump all
30:38 the time people have done no research in
30:42 the Bilderberg Group double EMU Grove
30:44 Club 300 the Council on Foreign
30:46 Relations etc etc Trump is where I am
30:50 man say okay dude well produce one photo
30:53 where he's ever been at these functions
30:55 where they determine how the world is
30:56 gonna go who's gonna be President
30:57 Chancellor prime minister and maybe I'll
31:00 entertain your thinking but again
31:04 they're having a Babylonian response
31:05 something in their past is causing them
31:07 to just earmark a person one way or
31:10 another happens with everyone you know
31:12 with everyone else you know that guy
31:15 seemed slimy to me I got a real negative
31:17 vibe off him or it or this action this
31:20 thing I don't know if we should be doing
31:22 this or I should be doing this
31:24 if the media let's just say the world
31:28 gets another 80s decade fantastic music
31:32 relative to this time not relative to
31:35 the 80s bunch of great musicians great
31:37 movies great art all uplifting remember
31:41 all the 80s rap was all about getting
31:43 out of the ghetto and building your life
31:45 up being nice to people and it's just
31:48 what it was all about it was not bunch
31:49 of social lessons remember Run DMC you
31:52 talk too much it was about the social
31:55 training of like etiquette he dude talk
31:58 for a little second and then shut up let
32:00 someone else talk and then you talk you
32:02 know it's a process we go through it's
32:04 not something that some parents teach
32:05 kids that's what Run DMC was making a
32:07 joke up that's cool
32:10 what is it white lines Grandmaster Flash
32:12 and the other dude saying get off
32:13 cocaine you'll screw young don't do it
32:16 right let's say we get another decade
32:18 like that
32:20 everything's going great back to the
32:22 future happens again something like that
32:24 and then the globalists who are all
32:28 about misery and control because misery
32:32 is what they live in and control is what
32:35 they don't have which they really want
32:37 it's because for them again control for
32:40 them only is satisfied if they have
32:42 absolute control
32:43 it's beyond narcissism narcissism it is
32:47 I don't know I don't even know if these
32:51 people are human you know but they
32:55 control nowadays all the press right
32:58 they control all the shows they get
33:01 created for Netflix HBO and movie
33:05 theaters they control it all they modify
33:09 your scripts to put in weird stuff
33:11 sometimes okay they make a plan and they
33:16 take awhile to make plans you know that
33:18 look were 20 years on something they
33:19 don't care and then they make a
33:22 strategic decision now in the past what
33:26 I have seen is a slow erosion of
33:32 societal standards to make sure that
33:36 it sort of infects us over time and I'll
33:42 tell you you know one of the mechanisms
33:44 we need to get rid of and it's sort of
33:48 organically happening yeah this may
33:51 sound like a technicality but keep this
33:52 in your mind this is something I see
33:54 every single day in my life right when
33:58 it comes to making movies or television
34:03 the costs are so outrageous that it
34:09 allows them with money to control it but
34:15 is it really necessary I mean there are
34:18 laptops out there I think you know quite
34:22 frankly I think almost every single
34:24 laptop that exists today it's
34:25 manufactured even a thousand-dollar
34:27 laptop and take a while but we actually
34:30 have the muscle and the power to make
34:33 and shoot and color correct and edit any
34:36 story that we can come up with the
34:38 citizens need to find decent actors and
34:40 decent writers but terms of making
34:42 something have a special effect or be on
34:46 the moon or whatever
34:47 well green screen and blue screen what
34:49 is it it's like wall painted green and
34:51 blue just light it evenly you can do a
34:53 cloth you can do a true green screen you
34:56 can make anything happen people do it
35:00 all the time but if you want to get
35:03 distribution oh my god you got to go
35:05 kiss somebody's asked to get your movie
35:06 just distributed among all these
35:08 streaming services well there becomes
35:11 the control the monopoly on what you see
35:17 well what was the new frontier the new
35:19 frontier was YouTube you know Google
35:22 video tried to exist for a little while
35:24 but man talk about not understanding
35:25 video streaming services YouTube knocked
35:29 it out of the park for a good 10 years
35:33 it was unbelievably a new frontier of
35:37 information two or three years ago the
35:41 deep state moved in and started
35:43 censoring because they were being
35:44 exposed at an alarming rate and they
35:47 still are being exposed at alarming rate
35:48 and I mean amazingly alarming
35:51 so there's all these apparatus in place
35:55 to make sure that what you see is
35:57 governed which is why we like things
35:59 like bits you but now if you're able to
36:03 be influenced then it goes inside your
36:06 brain I talk about this every once while
36:10 on episodes but there's this fetish with
36:14 perverts they play a game called I made
36:20 you look let's say that you know you're
36:26 aware of negative things that happen in
36:28 this world if a child disappears and
36:31 then you find out later in the news that
36:34 their body was found somewhere and it
36:37 was violated you know as an adult I
36:39 could only imagine what happened to that
36:41 kid this is the most awful thing and we
36:44 have to change society right now the
36:46 perv actually derives from this content
36:49 in large numbers nowadays right used to
36:52 be way back before all this happened it
36:53 would be a bizarre parental situation
36:56 somebody drops their kids into foster
36:59 care there happens to be a bad foster
37:00 care pairing all hell can break loose
37:02 for them right but let's just say you
37:05 have a normal family none of that's
37:06 happening in your circle you don't know
37:08 anyone who's ever lost a child to these
37:10 pedesta kind of people but then you're
37:15 gonna watch a television show something
37:18 on Netflix maybe it's a cop worship show
37:21 some murder mystery thing I mean say in
37:25 say us show CIOs show
37:27 and three tough to write those episodes
37:29 over and over and over again rat meets
37:32 think about it you're pumping out shows
37:34 once a week for years and years and
37:37 years and they put them in all different
37:39 regions of the world Walking Dead had
37:41 this problem or they or and they make a
37:46 movie that is got a franchise that you
37:49 love some superhero that you love but in
37:54 order to create a nemesis protect
37:56 antagonist because they've all been done
37:58 a million times now they go for some
38:01 super dark stuff because we don't have a
38:06 clear methodology to establish kind of a
38:10 rite of passage or you know a man boy
38:14 can prove that he's a man by being tough
38:15 right it used to be okay well you're
38:18 gonna hunt the lion now you're gonna run
38:21 off to some war or something and and get
38:24 a chance to show that you are both
38:26 honorable Patriot but you're also
38:28 capable of staring a lion in the face
38:29 and killing it right which is really
38:32 strange like eating a lion seems like
38:33 the strangest thing on earth but because
38:37 that doesn't exist music became a huge
38:39 outlet you got rock and roll back a my
38:43 time frame it was about becoming a man
38:45 through learning an instrument or at
38:47 least you know you just pick things you
38:50 gave away your toys and you gave away
38:52 your BMX bicycles and you got yourself a
38:54 hot rod
38:55 and then you fixed it up you learn how
38:57 to work the engine and the suspension
38:58 and you wouldn't worked at whatever
39:00 store you worked at and you bought the
39:02 new back tires that are bigger and all
39:03 this other stuff
39:05 and then it became gangsterism kids
39:10 feeling the genetic push to become
39:14 adults just a genetic thing to take over
39:17 the decision-making process for their
39:19 life which is the right of passage
39:20 moment but instead of having an outlet
39:24 to do that they get in trouble and
39:27 trouble is what it's all about and again
39:30 almost every single one of these guys in
39:33 LA that have been head of like the Crips
39:36 or the Bloods or whatever with their
39:37 massive pimps or whatever they all relax
39:40 typically in the end it's interesting I
39:42 just watched a new documentary about the
39:46 Yakuza gang members and other gang
39:48 members this Spectre game and Japan no
39:52 he's like 15 16 year olds running
39:54 motorcycles around old
39:56 ATL like 80s and 70s motorcycles from
39:59 America and from over there
40:02 and yeah I was you know they have bats
40:06 and things cuz they can't have guns over
40:08 there it's just very interesting the
40:10 this phenomenon happens everywhere
40:12 except in the jungle where rite of
40:15 passage still exists either in South
40:18 America or Africa maybe even Australia
40:22 that burgeoning although they're fairly
40:24 modernized now
40:26 and so we are lured genetically towards
40:30 some difficulty to prove ourselves and I
40:35 think that there's a lot of folks that
40:38 are completely aware of this that don't
40:40 mean us well and so they know there's a
40:43 susceptibility of vulnerability when a
40:46 boy is becoming a man if you don't have
40:50 a strong father in your life and you're
40:52 a man your boy scuse me
40:54 you become man your father doesn't at
40:55 least say okay we're gonna go fishing
40:57 we're gonna go hunting we're gonna fix
40:59 the old car you're gonna help paint the
41:02 house I'm gonna teach you how to do all
41:03 these things keep you preoccupied hey my
41:06 dad did all that and taught me
41:08 electronics and a bunch of other stuff
41:09 and uncle's teaching me physics and
41:11 drawing and also theirs so I was totally
41:14 preoccupied I didn't have to do anything
41:15 crazy but I went through my little
41:17 gangster era which this is a laughable
41:19 tongue-in-cheek thing when the movie
41:21 warriors came out you know as a little
41:24 nine-year-old you know we didn't get any
41:26 fights or anything like that but we
41:28 started stealing and vandalizing we were
41:30 like little droogies without the
41:32 physical harm part of it or cars
41:36 or milk plus so it's not enough just to
41:41 say okay we have to police our minds
41:44 carefully to make sure that we don't get
41:46 infected with nasty algorithms remember
41:50 the movie seven with Brad Pitt and Kevin
41:53 Spacey for those of you didn't see it
41:57 yeah I believe there's seven murders but
41:59 boy whatever you know was a Clive Barker
42:05 so his name
42:07 we do that did the Hellraiser series and
42:12 all that stuff just some crazy demonic
42:16 [ __ ] you know the way these people are
42:18 murdered in the movie se7en it set a new
42:21 bar and gore in a movie now we had Texas
42:26 Chainsaw Massacre and stuff like that
42:28 were a little little cult movies on the
42:29 side but man terms of mainstream
42:31 everybody saw it they made you look and
42:37 as you see this you become desensitized
42:39 to it but at the same time you don't see
42:44 it and not fear it at a subconscious
42:47 level because as I said my last episode
42:50 you know the it'd as you're as four he
42:54 talks about it it's this chaotic kind of
42:57 uncontrollable part of your center core
42:59 and what if it is literate literally you
43:02 know it's it's not a real thing
43:04 necessarily right he's just trying to
43:06 wrap a metaphor around that internal
43:09 part of our chaos that we don't
43:10 completely understand and we're trying
43:12 to control our vessel right but if you
43:15 insert deep down inside a moment of
43:18 Terror which is what PTSD is all about
43:22 PTSD is not just for soldiers is for
43:24 anyone who experiences trauma what's
43:28 really interesting about PTSD today's
43:30 they've we have matured given a name
43:32 figured out what it is it's a lost
43:34 moment of chaos which is you were
43:38 getting into a nasty situation you have
43:40 an eye Edie blow up underneath your
43:41 Humvee and you didn't die but your
43:43 friends are in pieces and the fact that
43:46 you live gives you guilt you have this
43:49 moment you can't remember because your
43:51 short-term memory for ten minutes is a
43:52 race during traumatic situations but you
43:55 really did remember it and so it just
43:58 haunts you in the middle of the night
43:59 people are beat up other parents or
44:02 parental bodies
44:04 they compartmentalize while they're
44:06 being beat but that darkness goes inside
44:09 of us and then when we compartmentalize
44:11 out which is MKULTRA the entire platform
44:14 we're broken until we can go in and get
44:17 that thing and then pull out that gooey
44:20 thing and throw it away
44:23 so the I'm just calling the deep state
44:26 they want a hatch an agenda to erode our
44:31 ability to get along you know what's
44:36 really strange is and I've mentioned
44:40 this in several different ways but to
44:43 see a race riot in the United States of
44:45 America in the 21st century is sort of
44:51 baffling to me not that you know law
44:54 enforcement has an issue with an area
44:58 that's different that's law enforcement
45:00 but just natural citizens not getting
45:02 along because in my mind what I don't
45:06 understand is it in the 70s in the 80s
45:09 we were getting along just fine
45:11 and then all of a sudden the 90s it was
45:13 like when especially being in Los
45:16 Angeles I don't know about other regions
45:17 but there was a drug wars and drugs was
45:20 the you know was the exclusive reason
45:23 why these wars were occurring in most
45:26 cases you know even a territorial Wars
45:28 about who's gonna sell drugs at
45:29 particular area well because our
45:34 intelligence agencies were targeting the
45:36 ghettos when people in Los Angeles who
45:39 didn't live in the ghettos were seeing
45:41 the news and being terrified that they
45:43 were going to be a victim of a drive-by
45:45 because they were dry they were driving
45:47 by cars on the 405 and just shooting him
45:49 up as initiation thing didn't happen as
45:53 much as it felt like it was happening
45:55 but it did happen
45:58 and so we had a little bit of like oh
46:00 gosh everybody else of all colors is
46:02 fearing these kids of these you know
46:04 more specific colors and it was building
46:07 up you know tension all orchestrated by
46:12 drug sales being brought in from South
46:14 America in Afghanistan right but we were
46:20 getting along great
46:21 before that outside these ghetto areas
46:26 that were victimized so imagine let's
46:30 put ourselves in their boardroom and
46:32 they're gonna hatch some evil into the
46:36 world to infect our minds and get us to
46:40 believe that we have problems that we
46:43 don't actually have they're gonna get us
46:46 to be let's say one of the rub they say
46:49 one of their goals was to create a more
46:53 racial tension let's say that they
46:57 wanted us to feel hopeless let's say
47:01 they wanted husband and wife to hate
47:03 each other let's say they wanted kids to
47:07 hate their parents as quickly as
47:09 possible we'll just think about it every
47:13 objective that they have only has to
47:16 become a plot and a story on television
47:18 a plot and a movie and then they're
47:23 going to try to create case studies
47:25 whereby they tell their news agencies
47:29 okay you know you guys pick any story
47:32 you want to cover that you think is
47:34 important yes okay here's what you're
47:36 gonna do here's a list of themes that we
47:39 want you to promote to the tippy tippy
47:41 top you do what you keep your job you
47:44 don't do it your let go and the editors
47:46 and chiefs of every news organization
47:49 whether it be broadcast internet or
47:51 paper magazines whatever there's always
47:55 a head of state making all the decisions
47:57 about what they cover as a reporter
48:01 you're trying to cut your teeth you're
48:02 trying to make a name for yourself you
48:05 want to write a cover article you know
48:07 that's where you get the big alkylating
48:08 magazines just to say yeah work for Time
48:11 magazine
48:12 and I did to cover articles so the cover
48:15 the magazine is your article they will
48:17 do anything to get that some people
48:20 believe strongly and like Grammys and
48:22 Oscars and so they do anything to cater
48:25 to get this the the statute when art
48:27 itself denies that entire intent let's
48:32 not forget those are control apparatus
48:34 that's right well if you want that's
48:36 Danji you better knock all that cut
48:38 cursing out on your song so they hatch
48:44 brilliant writers into these themes and
48:47 I mean brilliant writers let's say you
48:50 wanted kids to hate their parents well
48:53 you can't just make a show necessarily
48:55 where kids just wake up one day and then
48:58 all of a sudden look at their parents
48:59 and they look like ghouls and so they
49:01 hate them or kill them or whatever
49:03 that'd be that'd be too on point as they
49:07 say in writing they would create some
49:11 perhaps narcissistic parents some
49:14 parents that are not hip
49:16 you know they stuck back in their youth
49:17 and didn't engage the the world that
49:20 their children are actually engaging in
49:22 be really subtle and they probably spend
49:26 the first 30 minutes of a two-hour movie
49:28 building up to this big arc where the
49:31 kid finally rebels at the first act and
49:34 then they're off to do something nuts
49:36 they hatched the plan the man didn't
49:39 Menendez brothers or something right
49:42 abusive parents and so they're gonna
49:45 kill them
49:46 mom's blamed for letting dad do crazy
49:49 things to his son supposedly all of
49:53 which may or may not be true in that
49:55 particular case I mentioned this to you
49:58 in the past but I want to put it on
50:00 point now because we're sort of talking
50:02 about this predictive programming theme
50:05 based engineering of humanity the
50:08 predictive programming is obviously the
50:10 weird game that they play where they
50:12 inject something into a Simpsons episode
50:15 that then becomes real and it's very
50:18 scary when you see that happen because
50:19 you're thinking oh my god am I is my
50:21 whole life a movie you know
50:24 you don't want that to be the case trust
50:26 me less maybe our directors like Wes
50:29 Anderson or something so I grew up with
50:33 grandparents that died together all of
50:36 them whether or not my grandmother got
50:38 remarried after my grandfather died
50:40 which happened she stayed with him until
50:42 the very end he was 60 years old and she
50:45 was 58 when he died mother grandparents
50:49 I think one was 76 it was 79 because he
50:51 died earlier than her okay they died
50:54 together now my generation the next one
50:57 down the baby boomers are almost all
51:00 categorically divorced when my parents
51:03 got divorced it was sort of like this is
51:06 weird man I don't care if they do but
51:09 all my parents friends for the most part
51:12 up until the 80s were married so I were
51:15 in the 70s when my parents got divorced
51:17 most people were married three years
51:19 later it was like I couldn't find a
51:21 friend with two parents in the household
51:24 how did they orchestrate a massive
51:27 social engineering whereby they had to
51:30 convince the parents to get divorced to
51:35 not give it another try whatever
51:38 happened it was over okay let's look at
51:42 it well there's all kinds of agendas
51:45 that were going on the 70s one was to
51:47 say a woman shouldn't feel like a true
51:50 woman unless she has a job working for
51:51 the man right being a mother has no
51:54 value you've heard me say this several
51:56 times I marathoned mash with a buddy of
52:01 mine to study its writing and just to be
52:03 entertained today it's kind of goofy but
52:06 once you start the episode you start
52:07 getting addicted but I got all the way
52:09 through it and didn't even realize until
52:11 he finished Cheers right after that and
52:13 in Frasier after that what I was seeing
52:15 was a subtle engineering of something
52:18 I'd never seen before because in my
52:21 household my father it was just sort of
52:24 what was on TV on the few channels that
52:25 we had they did reruns of the Brady
52:28 Bunch and Leave It to Beaver and my
52:30 three sons and a hundred other shows
52:34 the honeymooners George and Gracie
52:39 everybody's married everyone's working
52:42 through their issues that's part of the
52:43 plot and it was it was never a situation
52:47 where you got divorced simply because
52:49 something bad happened it gave you
52:51 moments to build up your character to be
52:54 a better husband to be a better wife to
52:56 be a better person to get through trials
52:58 together well in mesh like I've said
53:03 before for the hardcore listeners
53:05 infidelity was a huge probably 40
53:09 percent theme of the entire show Hawkeye
53:13 he wasn't married was getting everyone
53:15 else who was married to sleep with him
53:16 plus some single people there his
53:20 partner swapped out but then you have
53:24 sorry can't remember the names but the
53:26 the nurse who's unwed she is in a
53:31 perpetual affair with this other guy
53:34 who's got a wife at home back in America
53:36 they're a North Korean war by the way or
53:39 the Korean War excuse me now Hawkeye his
53:43 first buddy wasn't buried so it was sort
53:45 of like two bachelors and they were both
53:47 doing the same thing getting all the
53:48 nurses to cheat on their husbands or
53:50 boyfriends or whatever not in every case
53:52 but a lot of sleeping around
53:55 when Hawkeye his buddy quit the show
53:58 because he thought he was gonna be more
53:59 successful doing movies sadly he wasn't
54:02 his buddy who replaced him they they
54:05 wrote him as a married very loyal
54:07 husband and he was always turning down
54:10 opportunities to sleep with people until
54:12 one episode he did cross the line and he
54:15 cheated on his wife and he felt horrible
54:19 but he did it so we're watching this
54:23 most popular sitcom at the time on TV I
54:26 mean it was literally the most popular
54:28 sitcom on TV remember The Jeffersons
54:30 stayed married good times stayed married
54:35 but this little algorithm got inserted
54:38 and it was super popular and you're
54:39 getting endorphins as you're watching it
54:41 is every time you laugh you're getting a
54:42 splash the chemicals
54:44 so as the two are cheating on somebody
54:47 boom I mean you know when you
54:49 participate in someone committing
54:52 infidelity you're kind of doing the same
54:54 thing I mean you're enabling the whole
54:55 situation unless they've lied to you and
54:57 said they're single okay well if I said
55:01 to you today that was mashed back in the
55:04 70s and early 80s if I said to you today
55:07 you know I'm one of my friends on
55:10 Facebook is cheating on with this woman
55:13 you know he's married she's married and
55:15 they're hooking up you know in some
55:17 hotel or whatever or even they don't
55:18 even hook that up but boy they're
55:20 letting you know they're totally looking
55:22 the other way in their relationship and
55:23 sexting or something would you be
55:26 terribly surprised not at all it happens
55:29 all the time now right it's normal
55:32 we're desensitized to it and we expect
55:34 it if any one of your friends says
55:36 they're getting a divorce
55:37 does that sound surprising to you that
55:40 you know 90% of the time nowadays I knew
55:43 it would never last mm-hmm that's why
55:48 it's problem there's the old saying if
55:52 you feed it it grows okay
55:56 now let's think of every theme that life
55:59 has in it being a seed I think it's it
56:04 would be tough 20 years ago to get what
56:08 I'm about to say to go down is easy
56:11 maybe 25 years ago to be honest but if I
56:16 said okay you watch you know you you
56:19 know you're gonna watch a massive amount
56:21 of pornographic material videos on the
56:24 YouTube or VHS tapes back in the day or
56:26 whatever and you just watch everything
56:29 that's out there we know right away at
56:34 least 25 years ago especially that
56:37 person's mind is going to get perverse
56:39 it is going to get misaligned with the
56:41 rest of society and their ability to
56:44 engage in a happy physical relationship
56:48 with someone is going to be next to
56:49 impossible unless for whatever reason
56:53 the person they married is into the same
56:55 thing but even that has its issues
56:57 whose loyalty becomes really problematic
57:01 you know is it the same people in every
57:03 single movie you watch no it's different
57:05 people every single time you watch a
57:06 movie okay well that means you're
57:08 supposed to have multiple partners even
57:10 if you're married war used to be
57:13 something that society understood you
57:17 know one of my grandfather's was in
57:19 World War two
57:22 I don't think either one of them well
57:24 sorry I don't think any one of my family
57:26 was in World War one but they were alive
57:29 at the time all my grandparents were
57:33 alive during Korean War during the
57:35 Vietnam War and when you started to see
57:37 the body bags come back and you know my
57:39 I think I might have mentioned this
57:42 before but one of my grandmother's was
57:44 engaged to a guy they went to World War
57:47 two and died in a plane accident it was
57:51 actually a friendly they'd just done a
57:53 bombing run over Germany had turned
57:54 around and the tips of the wings banged
57:57 into each other and that caused one of
57:59 the planes to split open like an egg is
58:01 what his buddy said and even though he
58:04 was told to wear his parachute he didn't
58:05 want to work because they were huge
58:06 bulky and heavy but his buddy did wear
58:09 his parachute and he survived became a
58:10 POWs for six months
58:13 and then I guess when the war was over
58:15 he came home and told my grandmother
58:19 what happened
58:20 and she lost her fiancee and then
58:21 married my grandfather so when it comes
58:25 to that generation knee jerking into war
58:29 which is so strange because they did get
58:31 into it
58:32 they did it for the sake of honor and
58:35 you know our allies blah blah blah no
58:37 one understood via nominal I mean nobody
58:40 did even the people that went over there
58:41 especially came back on what was all
58:44 that for they might have developed
58:45 hatred towards a group of Vietnamese
58:48 people than any other scenario they
58:51 would have sat down and broke bread
58:52 together because of the apparatus of war
58:55 they had their minds change they had you
58:59 know this despair that if we don't stop
59:01 communism in Vietnam or Korea this is
59:05 gonna suddenly pandemic around the world
59:07 me a break but every seed of everything
59:12 that could happen in your life every
59:14 valley that you could go down to become
59:17 a certain thing you have to be very
59:20 careful not to feed it and I think
59:23 that's there's a voluntary and an
59:26 involuntary caution that Marshall
59:29 McLuhan was getting to which was you
59:34 better be careful what you pick what you
59:36 select to you know feed inside you
59:39 because it will grow and in the other
59:43 side is you better be careful what
59:45 medium you use to ingest any version of
59:47 reality because that's what it is
59:50 because that will plant the seed inside
59:53 you and then it will grow something you
59:56 didn't put in yourself personally but it
59:59 showed up and it grew I'm gonna tell you
60:03 from being an American you can tell me
60:05 if you're outside America my
60:08 understanding of the Middle East before
60:11 1991 was next to nothing I didn't know I
60:16 mean you know if someone said Iraq I'd
60:18 be like yeah not a country over there
60:19 Afghanistan yeah I know that's a country
60:21 Saudi Arabia is that a country or is
60:23 that just a group of people like I
60:24 didn't know well
60:26 once the war blows up over there then
60:28 all of a sudden I know personally
60:32 now obviously stuff bad stuff has been
60:34 going on over there signal Brzezinski
60:36 Brzezinski went over there and
60:38 weaponized the culture over there and
60:40 got them on a radical version of Islam
60:44 with infidel passages and Sharia law
60:46 because he wanted them to be his minions
60:51 I've talked in the past about having
60:54 like a magic machine and tell me if
60:57 you've ever had this thought I mean
60:59 seriously
61:00 let me know if you've ever had this
61:02 thought a machine that we have like say
61:07 there's a little card that you can push
61:11 in the front that's got paper it's made
61:13 of paper there's a pin on the side of
61:15 the machine and then there's one button
61:17 on the top big blue button on the top
61:20 it's a friendly button and the way the
61:24 machine works is this machine will
61:27 operate one time that you will probably
61:32 have this exact example but the effect
61:35 of the machine is probably what you
61:36 might have conceived of the way it works
61:41 is that you write down a thought a
61:44 passage on the cart with the pin make it
61:50 as specific as you possibly can but the
61:52 card is not too big you got to get to
61:54 the point you got to think about it for
61:56 a year before you write it all that way
61:58 down practice it practice it way it
62:01 works is you put the card in the Machine
62:03 and you push the button and the Machine
62:07 makes every human being on earth have
62:10 this particular thought for 24 hours
62:15 that's all I'm gonna work once what
62:19 would you write down the card that you
62:22 would want everyone to think the goal
62:25 being of the normal sovereign citizens
62:27 would be a good passage most likely to
62:30 get everyone to see that we are all in
62:33 this together that we are sovereign
62:36 beings the no-man's over another man
62:39 despite what some people
62:40 might want you to believe and the goal
62:44 would be that your passage would be so
62:46 clean and so pure and so perfect that
62:49 would inject an idea that cannot be
62:51 erased from any human being thus
62:56 improving the world bringing us into a
63:01 level of peace and serenity that will
63:05 last throughout the ages something that
63:08 we would then teach our children but
63:10 even children would have this thought -
63:13 everyone understands what would you
63:17 write on the card but what is that
63:20 machine doing technically speaking it's
63:24 injecting a little bit of reality
63:29 into the minds of every human being
63:33 that sounds like a magical machine
63:34 doesn't it matcha machine doesn't exist
63:36 wouldn't be cool if you can make that
63:37 machine why you can't make that machine
63:39 but you know it's funny it already
63:42 exists it's called a television a cell
63:45 phone computer maybe a movie theater
63:49 nowadays maybe your radio definitely
63:53 printed magazines printed newspapers for
63:55 some folks that are old but now while I
64:01 was describing the machine let me ask
64:02 you this before I told you well let's
64:07 see after I told you what it does did
64:10 you have a quick millisecond thought
64:12 wouldn't be horrible if they controlled
64:15 the Machine and they put something super
64:18 bad summer bran Abramovich [ __ ]
64:21 passage in there would not have been bad
64:25 some spirit cooking things some devil
64:27 worshipping thing some human sacrifice
64:31 thought how good it is eating and
64:35 drinking Bloods great sort of thing well
64:40 they own the machine and it baffles me
64:44 that we allow these organizations to
64:47 still exist now the readings are going
64:50 down everywhere for all that stuff we
64:53 prefer to hear from each other instead
64:54 of pundits the talk to you like this
64:57 right the broadcast speak it's the most
65:01 unbelievable ritual used to harp on this
65:03 a lot in season 1 & 2 they talk to you
65:06 like this it's like a hypnotizing weird
65:12 rhythm of speaking it's fake and it's
65:16 right in your face and that's what
65:18 broadcast school teaches people and
65:20 what's really funny is when I see some
65:23 of these channels there's a woman out
65:26 there who actually has some pretty good
65:27 content
65:28 she's a believe in Texas I think but she
65:32 tries to mock that broadcast speak to
65:35 sound more professional and it's a naive
65:39 sort of the Luciferian way of talking
65:44 and I wish you wouldn't I wish he would
65:47 just speak in her normal voice cuz
65:48 there's no way in hell her husband's
65:50 listen to her dog like that if she talks
65:51 about a lot in her videos but again
65:54 she's a good-hearted person you can tell
65:56 she's got her heart in the right place
65:59 so let's bring it to the modern-day time
66:02 where we are right now and sort of take
66:06 some inventory of where some of these
66:08 things go now the easy thing to say is
66:10 that all of its bad and that's probably
66:12 damn near the truth I have a concern
66:16 that it's only recently sort of bubbled
66:21 up for me personally because I don't
66:23 think I was aware of this possibility
66:25 and I'm not saying what I'm about to
66:26 suggest is affecting us
66:29 the way I'm fearing that it might be
66:31 affecting us but I want to highlight
66:34 this in your mind so that you can
66:37 take inventory of it in your own soul
66:39 and see if you want to make decision or
66:41 they'll have to continue ingesting this
66:43 kind of material I'm gonna mention the
66:48 queue and on group for the listener on
66:51 YouTube that tried to scold me about
66:53 queue is not a man he's a group of
66:55 people so I dude you don't know so I see
66:59 a few you know but anyway he
67:04 communicates that he's multiple people
67:05 actually he doesn't actually communicate
67:07 that he says he's only known by nine
67:09 other people he doesn't quite say that
67:11 he doesn't have a single voice for a
67:14 single person but what have we learned
67:17 if you have ever just investigated queue
67:19 and on you don't have to be a believer
67:21 and I'm totally on the fence with this
67:23 whole thing he's starting to freak me
67:25 out a little bit that this is all
67:29 a huge deep state thing but I told you
67:34 about that trick that Hollywood does
67:36 which is I made you look I made you see
67:38 season 7 episode 1 of Walking Dead you
67:43 know if you watching that show and you
67:45 were totally into it then that show
67:49 would have blown your mind they showed
67:51 the most gruesome realistic special
67:53 effects of bashing people's heads in
67:57 with a baseball bat with a bunch of
68:00 spikes on it killing off two of the
68:03 characters we really liked in the most
68:06 brutal savage way possible it was
68:10 atrocious I stopped watching and have
68:12 never seen another episode just out of
68:15 protest but we have heard these
68:20 incredible stories about all this dark
68:25 dark stuff that the people who control
68:29 the world are being accused of doing now
68:31 it wouldn't surprise me at all that if
68:34 that that is true it would not surprise
68:37 me but have you ever seen anything that
68:42 you can't unsee that you maybe wish you
68:48 hadn't seen all the details now if
68:52 you're like me you have this sort of I
68:54 don't know maybe it could be described
68:59 in absolute terms is sort of a cowboy
69:02 mentality of okay
69:05 we got a bunch of dark people on the
69:06 planet that run the place and as dark as
69:10 their world is we have to have the
69:12 ability to deal with their darkness and
69:15 let's just say as an example the stories
69:19 I mentioned in a previous episode where
69:21 kids were being abducted and abused and
69:25 a bunch of other horrible things that
69:27 led to their demise we have to have the
69:30 Constitution as men to go and rescue
69:34 them and we can't be so weak but as we
69:38 go into their world where you might have
69:40 you know a celebrity in there laughs and
69:43 their head off because they've seen it
69:44 and engaged in it so much they're
69:46 covered in a bunch of flaky body matter
69:49 and they're just got it was the greatest
69:51 day ever and we go in and we throw up so
69:54 we're not very useful so part of me is
69:57 like yeah some of us have to take the
69:59 mental hit so that if we ever have the
70:01 ability to help communicate about it
70:04 whatever we're not overwhelmed I just
70:08 don't know that the entire public needs
70:10 to hear all that stuff because it starts
70:13 to really erode our vision of the
70:18 universe to the point where if I inject
70:21 inside your mind with good intentions
70:25 I've done it on the show telling you
70:28 about their rituals they're bad stuff
70:33 goodbye view only situations where I've
70:35 dialed in and and I've planted the seed
70:39 given to me by cue given to me by other
70:41 folks and I'm planting it you know what
70:44 is it David Icke exposed jimmy savile my
70:47 god
70:48 15 20 years before he died and all of
70:50 his history was revealed same with Alex
70:53 Jones and a bunch of other folks have
70:55 been trying to wake people up and so
71:00 don't know
71:02 there are Catholic priests and bishops
71:06 all around the world accused of hundreds
71:09 per person
71:12 child molestation cases and stuff what
71:15 part of it's kind of like you could say
71:19 I want to know this because I want to
71:20 know that organization engages in this
71:22 protects those guys ships them all
71:24 around the world provides tens of
71:26 millions of dollars with the legal
71:27 services pays off judges so they get
71:29 smacked on the handle orders with a guy
71:31 in Australia just got off have you got a
71:35 bunch of horrible stuff some of us feel
71:39 like we need to know now if a guy gets
71:42 incarcerated he's found guilty gets
71:45 incarcerated and he's gonna live the
71:47 rest of his life in some you know pedo
71:51 prison or whatever maybe I need to know
71:54 that maybe I don't the guy who's been
71:56 dealt with maybe I don't need to know
71:58 because he was dealt with now if
72:01 something happens in your local chapter
72:02 your local area and it's the first time
72:06 you've ever heard of it but it's been
72:07 going on all around the world
72:08 you know Dewey does it does it help us
72:11 find the guy in our local chapter
72:13 because we now are aware the people who
72:18 have access to kids sometimes inherit
72:22 predators like the Boy Scouts has had
72:24 tons of predators in there so you can
72:28 see how complicated it gets the fine
72:31 line between the reality the darkness of
72:36 reality and the life we want to live
72:39 personally it should be relatively
72:44 infuriating the haiti's that work as it
72:48 might make you feel that way but to find
72:50 out that this stuff has been going on
72:53 I'm gonna share something that I just
72:56 recently discovered I think I mentioned
73:01 it about ten episodes ago but we're in
73:04 the middle of situation I think I
73:06 mentioned and you know again this last
73:08 couple months
73:11 the actress who played the little girl
73:13 in poltergeist her name is Heather nice
73:17 on the movie when I was 12 or something
73:20 like that yeah 12 1982 my dad picked me
73:24 up from school and said you gotta see
73:25 this movie grab my buddy and we took him
73:26 into Braintree Massachusetts and gave us
73:29 the minds that go in and watch this
73:30 movie it's really cool but I never seen
73:34 that movie and you know watch it loved
73:35 it to death
73:36 we bought it as soon as it came out on
73:37 tape watch another million times it's
73:39 great but then I saw it again as an
73:41 adult and for some weird reason I had
73:48 this weird concern for her and I just
73:51 remember looking at her going oh my god
73:53 you know it's like look how vulnerable
73:54 she is and as I had learned what I had
73:56 learned was that kids get you know
74:00 abused in Hollywood now by the time I
74:05 had had this thought she had already
74:07 passed in the late eighties she was
74:10 seven years old when she was in
74:12 poltergeist I think she was about 12
74:14 years old or so by the time she had
74:17 finished principal footage for
74:18 poltergeist three so I'm watching this
74:22 then late 90s or early 2000s and I just
74:26 had this overwhelming McCobb feeling
74:29 that oh my god you know someone could do
74:34 something to her and I didn't even know
74:35 I don't even realize at the time that
74:38 she had passed I don't think but I came
74:42 into the lounge about three months ago
74:44 my buddy's like you know did you know
74:45 did you hear about the poltergeist girl
74:47 it was just like 20 20 I'm like what
74:50 about her isn't she dead
74:53 and she and he said yeah well they're
74:56 starting to ask questions now that she
74:58 may have been sexually abused which led
75:01 to her death
75:03 and so because of the times I don't have
75:06 such a problem contemplating that that
75:08 was potentially true
75:11 the details of her death goes something
75:13 like this she was shooting poltergeist
75:16 three and which happened in a building I
75:21 think it was a gig two and three
75:24 confused I actually didn't think she was
75:26 in three but she all of a sudden had a
75:31 real bad stomach pain and she went home
75:35 and she had a fever and she went to the
75:40 hospital in San Diego with just
75:42 immediately you took her right to the
75:43 hospital and she died two hours into a
75:47 surgery to fix her colon when they wrote
75:52 her death certificate they said she died
75:57 of a congenital bowel problem lower
76:01 intestinal problem her pediatrician /
76:05 doctor because he had grown up with her
76:08 said publicly look I don't know because
76:12 I've dealt with kids with that
76:14 particular condition that they wrote
76:15 down on the death certificate and I've
76:19 never ever heard of a kid having a
76:21 congenital problem that led to death
76:22 that didn't lead to previous encounters
76:25 with the problems and then they went off
76:29 and got Frank Sinatra's doctor to write
76:32 a counter article against him saying oh
76:34 no I've totally heard this before okay
76:38 the mobster singers doctor covered for
76:43 this whole situation I don't think I
76:45 need to connect the dots for you her
76:50 problem resembles greatly what could
76:56 happen to a minor if a grown man or to
77:01 abuse her
77:03 so you know recently I had look I got
77:09 exposed to potentially potentially a
77:12 real situation that was really really
77:15 negative as far as that feeling I had I
77:20 think it was I think it was really the
77:22 result of having my own daughter and
77:25 then seeing a very vulnerable you know
77:28 that kids are just you know the most
77:32 priceless vulnerable things on planet
77:35 earth to conceive that someone would
77:38 ever hurt them is a very dark chapter in
77:43 your life too to hear news of anyone's
77:47 children being abused and having to
77:51 contemplate why anyone would ever do
77:53 such a thing it's mind-blowing
77:56 it's dark very dark I can tell you my
78:02 own life having born exactly the year I
78:05 was born which is 1969
78:08 and then going through the decades that
78:11 I went through I could tell that the
78:14 adults were extremely euphoric by the
78:17 mid 70s because the Vietnam War had
78:20 concluded no one was worried about
78:22 getting dragged into it my father
78:25 managed to go in and get out without
78:26 getting being sent to combat which I
78:30 don't think my father ever would have
78:31 survived combat ever as badass as he was
78:37 the 80s even though they were riddled
78:40 with some financial issues of my family
78:42 still it was like you could come home
78:45 and watch some pretty wholesome
78:46 entertainment you turn on the stereo and
78:48 it was like the best music and the
78:50 planet was coming out it was great I
78:53 moved to California
78:57 it was euphoric absolutely for it moved
79:01 to the Bay Area just a coincidental
79:02 thing and everything started getting
79:05 dark wasn't the Bay Area necessarily it
79:06 was just music was getting dark it's
79:08 really strange when I would go talk to
79:10 kids because I was a kid in my 20s and
79:13 I'm looking at kids again like I'll
79:16 repeat like a mantra kids of my own
79:19 family extremely wealthy of all the
79:21 money in the world going to thrift
79:23 stores and dressing like bums and and
79:25 literally stealing the best clothing out
79:27 of those places so that anybody who
79:28 really needs it goes in and they don't
79:30 have anything then of course 9/11
79:32 happens and the rest is just history we
79:37 lost some rights some very important
79:38 constitutional rights on that and as a
79:40 result of that event which is what they
79:42 love to do they're gonna try to take the
79:44 current crisis of 2020 and they're gonna
79:46 try to squeeze as much out of us they
79:48 possibly can including injecting us with
79:50 bunch of poison I have never before
79:54 heard not even back at during 9/11 I've
80:01 never heard before more despair and
80:07 worry about us going to a police state
80:12 as I have heard in the last month and
80:15 2020 and when I say those that statement
80:19 it's actually a giant statement from
80:22 me which is to say you know I woke up
80:25 around 2005 learned about a bunch of
80:29 dark stuff and again you know old old
80:33 horses that I don't remotely completely
80:37 agree with like David Icke who's got the
80:39 reptilian thing which I think is
80:41 completely ridiculous but maybe I'm
80:43 wrong and Alex Jones who is now slightly
80:47 different kind of person I respect them
80:49 greatly for what they did for me when
80:52 they did it you know it's just like a
80:54 best friend you know they change right
80:56 you know it's like well 10 years ago I
80:57 got with this guy all the time and it's
80:59 not that I dislike him I still hang out
81:00 with him anymore I was waking up when no
81:03 one was awake roughly speaking great and
81:06 I'm sure some of you had the same exact
81:08 experience some of you were awake a long
81:10 time ago way before any of us and so
81:14 we're sitting in a world going oh my god
81:16 guys we have to wake up look what's
81:17 going on and then you look at the
81:19 presidents at the time they were all
81:20 deep state shells pre-selected by the
81:23 Bilderberg Group I mean it was like a
81:25 foregone conclusion every year of your
81:26 life it wasn't going in a positive
81:28 direction today I still believe that
81:36 more positive things are happening the
81:39 negative things and I think the number
81:40 one positive theme of what's going on in
81:42 the world is that I have never ever hurt
81:45 and seen so many people aware of our
81:50 well I should say this oh aware of the
81:53 way the world should be which is a do no
81:56 harm common law mechanism of living now
82:00 sadly there are police in every country
82:03 this seemed to be deep state operatives
82:05 whether or not they realize it or not
82:07 you know for instance there's a bunch of
82:11 churches that tried to celebrate Easter
82:13 and if you watch the Carano series you
82:16 know I've mentioned this before do I
82:19 think the state troopers is showed up
82:20 without masks rioting everybody tickets
82:23 for not self quarantine are literally
82:25 working for George Soros no I just think
82:29 they're all fee guys they love the
82:30 authority I have a bunch of like
82:32 Hightower
82:32 guys and they're just
82:35 stupidly violating things because in
82:38 their brain it's like it's all about the
82:40 rules man and so people are being duped
82:45 into being operatives for the deep state
82:48 and some people are very devious Lee
82:50 obviously part of the deep state which
82:52 is where you get all your fake news
82:53 reporters and and politicians and
82:57 what-have-you right so what I'm trying
83:00 to do indirectly is to say this even
83:05 though we've had a brush with globalism
83:07 in 2020 like we have never seen in world
83:11 history we've never seen anything like
83:13 this ever we've had world wars there
83:16 weren't as tumultuous as this shelter
83:19 and thing that happened in 2020 ever
83:21 never had this before where all of our
83:24 rights seem like they're an option your
83:28 rights aren't an option right common law
83:30 is not an option is the way this world
83:33 works it's the way the whole universe
83:35 has been created which is why we all
83:37 feel it in our hearts like if I say to
83:40 you I can give you a subtle common law
83:42 thing and you'll need jerk a response
83:45 that's correct that I can give you let's
83:49 say I'll give you a blatant one and I'll
83:51 give you a subtle one the subtle one is
83:52 you might debate it in your mind no we
83:56 should give up all of our freedoms so we
83:59 can get more safety right if I said is
84:04 it ever cool for your for some random
84:08 person with that we come into your house
84:10 where you're not home
84:11 yes especially when you're home but when
84:14 you're not home and steal something out
84:15 of your house of immense value whether
84:18 it be just a trinket that has no
84:19 empirical value to sell anywhere but
84:21 it's the trinket your relative gave you
84:24 and it means something to you to
84:25 something like a TV that you just paid
84:27 $5,000 for so on your credit card you
84:30 would instantaneously most likely say
84:33 hell no [ __ ] not so it's a horrible idea
84:35 well let's say you're listening to all
84:37 the corona stuff and you're like well
84:39 we're gonna have a vaccine soon and you
84:40 know you're not gonna be allowed to go
84:41 back to work your kids won't be allowed
84:43 to go to school because the World Health
84:44 Organization which is in Europe
84:47 is going to say so there's gonna be some
84:54 people who believe in vaccinations
84:56 because they've never done any research
84:57 in it they've never worked in pharma
84:58 well yeah I mean of course of course the
85:01 vaccinations oh my god I mean what are
85:02 you talking about that's like the best
85:04 thing on planet Earth
85:05 and some of your like until death do us
85:08 part will that thing ever be in my
85:10 system I'm making this episode so that
85:14 we can kind of stop the freight train of
85:18 life first what second you're stopping
85:21 at a station it looks like a Disneyland
85:23 station with Walt Disney greeting you so
85:27 you know you're safe nothing Bad's
85:29 happen we have been taken over his
85:31 organization and done a bunch of crazy
85:32 things with it he's legit man married
85:36 two kids it's all good and he's gonna
85:40 just you know talk to you and
85:43 re-establish what you believe about how
85:46 the world should work he's gonna play a
85:48 reflection session to you to say if you
85:50 say something that seems a little odd
85:52 you might make you listen to your own
85:54 words as a small digression I think it's
85:59 hilarious what Donald Trump did has of
86:03 the 13th of April which was technically
86:07 yesterday the fake news for instance
86:11 came out and said in every single
86:13 journal everywhere as the virus was
86:18 moving out of China and spreading all
86:20 over the world they all called it the
86:22 China virus the Wuhan virus one of the
86:25 two or both they said it first then is
86:30 there's something called a reflection
86:32 session which is you go talk to a
86:34 psychologist and they sit with you and
86:38 what they do is you say something to
86:40 them and there's two there's two factors
86:44 of a reflection session they repeat it
86:47 to you for two reasons one to clarify
86:50 that they understand what you just said
86:51 but two so you can hear your own voice
86:54 back and a lot of people I had this
86:58 happen to me when I was 18 years old
87:00 one of the guys at my church was a
87:02 doctor at Pepperdine University in
87:05 psychology he did a reflection
87:07 assessment to me and found out that I
87:09 had pent-up anger towards my parents for
87:15 essentially helping me zero when I came
87:18 to California having you know all my
87:21 other relatives being taken care of
87:22 including my parents by their parents
87:24 you know taking care of means co-signing
87:27 a loan for a car you know I didn't take
87:29 any money for college but they all had
87:31 their colleges paid for and so there was
87:33 this pent-up thing even though I loved
87:35 my life I totally dug my life I was
87:37 pissed and I never driving home that day
87:40 just driving fast all by myself just
87:44 exhausting all of that out of myself and
87:47 what was strange is by the time I
87:48 reached home was just a couple miles
87:51 away it had been it just evaporated out
87:55 of my system I finally understood a
87:57 little PTSD I had kinda of my own anger
88:02 towards my parents and then all of a
88:03 sudden I did I wasn't angry anymore it
88:06 was like I was reborn you know so what
88:09 Trump has been doing in these sessions
88:11 at the White House and his stomps and a
88:13 bunch of other stuff as he plays
88:14 reflection sessions with the press and
88:16 the funny thing is if he decided to
88:20 track it he could burn down every single
88:23 fake news organization from newspapers
88:25 to websites the broadcast television and
88:29 simply chronologically diagram this is
88:33 what you said I set it back to you
88:35 another bad guy this is what you said I
88:37 said it back to you I'm a bad guy it's a
88:40 very interesting process we haven't lost
88:44 any battles by any means in this world
88:47 we are fighting several battles and so
88:50 four fronts Europe and the EU has their
88:53 own battle they've got to get rid of the
88:55 EU dissolve all these globalist
88:57 organizations like the World Health
88:58 Organization like the World Trade
89:00 Organization like the World Bank it's
89:02 all got to go away everyone needs to
89:05 bring back their sovereign money backed
89:07 by whatever resources they have if
89:09 they've got a single bar of gold again
89:11 Bitcoin proves you
89:13 more than 1 bar of gold to back all your
89:15 money by golden but every country has a
89:18 ton of gold so they could be just fine
89:20 we have to own our bodies a hundred
89:23 percent I think it's phenomenal
89:26 you know these contradictions that you
89:29 get from individuals again they want to
89:31 eat a cow with eyeballs but they'll kill
89:33 a human being inside their room with
89:35 eyeballs they won't let anyone tell them
89:37 what they can do with their bought
89:39 including the human being that lives
89:41 inside them but they don't have any
89:43 problem telling you you have to take a
89:44 vaccination these are contradictory
89:47 things cognitive dissonance at a maximum
89:51 level we need to repeat these things to
89:55 people so that they have a leg to stand
89:57 on again one of the interesting things
90:03 you can do in the United States which I
90:05 find amazing that it's still there and
90:07 it still works is that religious
90:09 freedoms can actually make you immune
90:11 from a ton of things you can actually
90:14 get out of going to war by citing that
90:17 your religion doesn't allow you to do it
90:19 they might put you in jail like what is
90:22 a Cassius Clay but you can get out of
90:26 like the Amish can get rid of you can
90:29 get out of any vaccinations because they
90:31 say we don't believe in medicine but you
90:34 have to be a part of those organizations
90:35 before you can win in court right and so
90:39 it's phenomenal that there are loopholes
90:40 that work still and yet you got bill
90:44 gates walking around saying that you
90:45 know he's gonna microchip everybody and
90:48 destroy your genetics with the
90:50 vaccination and I want to make a this is
90:55 not exactly the most appropriate place
90:57 to put this point in here but we're kind
90:59 of hovering around the crisis of 2020
91:01 used I am in this conversation I want to
91:05 remind you all this is a little tidbit
91:06 you can repeat to people anything that
91:10 naturally occurs in this world
91:13 technically can't be patented
91:15 now biotech has the little exception
91:18 which is ludicrous that they're trying
91:20 to patent sequences of your DNA which is
91:23 absurd
91:25 one your protein patterns are really
91:27 what dictate your DNA anyway so the
91:29 whole theory is ridiculous button
91:31 they can't patent vitamin C they can't
91:34 patent the herb that gets rid of
91:36 erectile dysfunction so what they do is
91:39 they demonize through the World Trade
91:42 Organization all vitamins and minerals
91:44 that keep you healthy those are now
91:45 deemed toxins while pesticides up to one
91:47 hundred seventy six of them are legal to
91:49 put in your food most of the toxic
91:51 gloves meaning toxicology Department's
91:54 determine how much you can have of a
91:56 poison before it's going to affect you
91:58 medically and the World Trade
91:59 Organization has got them all jacked up
92:01 over the lethal levels some by little
92:03 some by a lot we have heard and it's
92:08 quite true that there are patents out
92:10 there for the corona virus well the
92:14 corona virus in its natural state could
92:16 not be patented because it is just an
92:19 organic thing that occurs in society
92:21 like all the the 360 plus versions of
92:26 influenza it just happens it just it's
92:28 in birds and humans and everything so in
92:32 order for something to have been
92:34 patented it has to have been synthesized
92:36 which is another convenient way of using
92:39 the word weaponized so the fact that
92:43 some of these things if they ever become
92:45 patented you're guaranteed that they
92:47 have been manipulated most likely in a
92:49 bsl-4 lab biosafety level 4 lab which is
92:55 the currently as far as disclosed
92:57 laboratories it's the highest volatility
93:01 laboratory on planet earth they make the
93:04 deadliest stuff known to man now there
93:06 may be a level 5 somewhere we don't know
93:08 about but let me just tell you don't
93:11 need to get any worse than bsl-4 to wipe
93:14 out the entire planet the nice thing is
93:17 and the good news is if you're feeling
93:19 any anxiety about what's going on one
93:22 check yourself check all the things that
93:24 you don't need to know like Prince said
93:27 turn the TV off turn the news off these
93:29 problems aren't for you and stop feeding
93:33 those seeds inside your soul especially
93:34 if they're giving you anxiety I'm gonna
93:38 suggest you shut it
93:39 you leave the battlefront for a little
93:41 while you no longer gonna be on the
93:42 frontline and that's just fine you can
93:44 participate in the back and you know
93:45 when way you can participate in the back
93:47 this seems perhaps illogical for some
93:50 people let's just make the world a happy
93:53 place so many of you if not every single
93:57 one of you I'm only about every single
93:59 one of you you have something charming
94:02 about you something that's funny get a
94:04 good sense of humor and a sense of
94:07 humors vary between people yeah you just
94:10 throw a bunch of stuff up in your social
94:12 media that just makes people laugh
94:13 maybe you just cut social media
94:15 completely off because it has too much
94:16 acidic stuff in it and so you interact
94:19 with society you put on a big smile you
94:21 go through the drive-through and the
94:23 poor kid that's fearing perhaps catching
94:26 something you know the other day I was
94:29 buying a burrito at one of my favorite
94:31 places here in California it's uh it's
94:34 one step above fast-food because it's
94:36 owned by a family and they really use
94:38 some amazing ingredients it's great but
94:40 I decided to tell the kid because he
94:43 could take my money and he was waiting
94:44 for my food to get finished before he's
94:46 gonna give it to me but as soon as he
94:47 flipped the door open the little window
94:49 I committed to telling the kid you know
94:52 thanks for working thanks for you know
94:55 staying open is like is what I said the
94:58 funny thing was is that he had already
95:00 grabbed a coupon for a free burrito
95:02 which is like you know nine bucks what
95:05 this place is so I'm saying this and I
95:08 surprised him I could see it on his face
95:09 he was like no one had said it to him
95:11 all day long
95:11 it's kind of what it look like great he
95:13 goes he smiles and he goes when you want
95:16 a free burrito he already had in his
95:18 hand but he was just like thank you with
95:21 the coupon both of us had this positive
95:24 moment I hope I brightened his day he
95:27 certainly brightened my day plus you
95:29 know I have to say I mentioned this this
95:32 is a random little factoid I had almost
95:34 like to hear your experience in this
95:38 particular area just as a wild
95:40 information transfer between especially
95:42 if you're in a different country but
95:43 even if you're all around the United
95:45 States I grew up in the Midwest where
95:48 kids are raised to be extremely
95:50 respectful because it's a little tiny
95:52 town right you know and if you act like
95:54 a dick everyone knows okay but when I
95:57 came to the city the fast-food helpers
96:01 for at least a couple decades they were
96:04 like these entitled cantankerous kids
96:06 you know I was like your fame and your
96:09 money I was like your orders all wrong
96:10 in the food compositions really bad over
96:13 the last I have to say even happen in
96:16 Huntington Beach and I moved here 17
96:18 years ago lately for probably I don't
96:22 even know in this transformed but
96:23 especially over I'd say at least the
96:25 last three years wherever I go in Orange
96:28 County the kids are so freakin nice
96:30 within the fast food industry and
96:34 they're all shapes sizes colors and
96:35 everything I mean it's just like it's
96:37 there's no one thing and so I mentioned
96:41 it to a friend of mine he lives here
96:42 local asset you know you notice the kids
96:44 have been really nice and she was like
96:46 yeah totally
96:47 yeah it's comparing notes on Allen but
96:50 again I just want to leave you with the
96:52 notion that hope is probably a fake
96:55 thing we're actually taking action we're
96:58 communicating with each other keep doing
97:00 it brighten the world you don't always
97:03 have to be on the frontline protect your
97:05 brain protect what goes in there protect
97:08 what you feed because it grows and this
97:10 is going from acidic news down to maybe
97:14 a fetish you got off on the side there's
97:16 a knee but ain't good for you you know
97:19 there's you know I'll give any example
97:21 to because we're locked in there's been
97:23 this this news article that keeps going
97:27 around but I mean I've got friends in
97:29 all kinds of different places I don't
97:31 know if people are hiding this from me
97:33 but they're talking about alcoholism
97:37 getting out of control during the
97:39 lockdown and I have to say you know I
97:41 know some friends that have definitely
97:44 had a few saucy nights but it's because
97:47 they have chat sessions with all their
97:50 friends like I know a girl that has
97:52 routine every week all the girls get
97:56 together and they have this like
97:57 drinking party through the through the
97:59 computer but this girl is getting
98:02 totally wasted and so then she's out the
98:05 next day and
98:06 I talked herds I she's like I tired went
98:08 on last night you know and it's like
98:09 mm-hmm
98:10 if that's not your normal behavior I
98:12 would be careful with some of that stuff
98:14 we all have our own demons so no one's
98:17 better than anybody else okay but you
98:21 know I take inventory every once in a
98:24 while but I'm making this episode
