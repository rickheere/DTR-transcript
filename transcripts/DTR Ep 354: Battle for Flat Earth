00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts all righty I can't believe
00:41 it's taken me this long to have the
00:42 Epiphany to record this episode this is
00:48 about the Flat Earth battlegrounds this
00:50 episode is if you were to put it into
00:54 visual metaphor it would be I got it's
00:58 like gangs in New York the movie gangs
01:01 in New York on one side I got all the
01:04 flat earthers we got meat cleavers and
01:07 baseball bats and loud you know bull
01:10 horns and on the other side I got all
01:12 the globus and they have all the same
01:15 [ __ ] both sides look very fit and
01:17 formidable and they feel super
01:20 passionate about their perception of the
01:23 earth or their uncertainty and maybe
01:28 there's like a mutt group sort of in the
01:30 center and they're sort of like well I'd
01:33 love to know which one of you guys are
01:34 gonna win this battle because then I'm
01:36 just gonna join what's left they're not
01:38 even gonna fight the battle we're just
01:39 kind of sitting in the center so we have
01:43 a listener that came in and made a
01:46 comment and on YouTube then we've had
01:51 some followers on Facebook and I want
01:53 you to know that before we start I love
01:56 and respect all of you you have to know
01:57 that and it's not some [ __ ]
01:59 statement I love you in that bro I don't
02:03 know what you call a girl bra no I don't
02:06 think so
02:07 but we have folks that are very
02:08 passionate about Flat Earth and I get a
02:14 kick out of there personally I think
02:15 that the memes are funny but some people
02:18 are getting a little disenfranchised
02:20 that there's more representation on the
02:24 Flat Earth side than there is on the
02:25 globe earth side part of me is kind of
02:28 like well everyone thinks it's a globe
02:32 so the debate is is it different now
02:37 again globe earth is only been around
02:38 500 years Flat Earth was around four
02:40 flat round discs you know held in by
02:43 Isis around for millennia before that
02:47 doesn't mean it's right doesn't mean
02:50 Globes right I mean maybe if there's a
02:53 center group that's willing to get into
02:55 the bras on 3-way brought some old New
02:57 York Bronx brawl some you know Warriors
03:01 2.0 it's all about [ __ ] flattered
03:03 wouldn't be funny
03:04 bring them all back Swan Cyrus the
03:10 Rogues baseball Furies Turbo Lacey's the
03:15 riffs the source and setting right next
03:18 to the Jones Street boys and nobody is
03:21 wasted nobody that's is a miracle and
03:24 miracles are the way things ought to be
03:27 absolutely first r-rated movie that I
03:30 absolutely fell in love with the
03:32 Warriors but what is surprising to me is
03:38 this passion that people have for the
03:43 shape that they think that the world is
03:45 a passion for flatter is a passion for
03:49 round earth passion for you know it's
03:52 funny because the matrix people it's
03:55 almost like they're the beatniks that
03:57 are kind of sitting outside man and they
03:59 got their [ __ ] jazz going you know
04:01 heroines playing a really cool [ __ ]
04:03 dynamic riff the matrix people are like
04:05 it doesn't matter you're both [ __ ]
04:07 wrong it's all goddamn matrix and
04:10 because you manifest your own reality
04:11 for you it is rounder for you it is flat
04:14 they're hip cats up there in that matrix
04:17 world
04:18 I believe it's round because I believe
04:21 in expanding earth I have never been
04:23 able to reconcile expanding earth with
04:25 the flat disc model at the same time I
04:30 love it when someone can pay me with a
04:34 meme with some visual example some movie
04:38 that makes me go yeah there's that thing
04:40 it really does seem flat doesn't it and
04:42 that weird you know and so I try to
04:44 reconcile it in my mind with the ether
04:45 model the universe and you know I think
04:49 that the jury is out in its absolute
04:52 form the jury's out on everything again
04:54 if you believe it's a globe well Jesus
04:57 Christ well why don't you get your NASA
04:58 agency to give you a picture of the
05:00 earth
05:00 from [ __ ] space that we can believe
05:04 that's the problem
05:05 I believe it's round but I believe it
05:07 because I can see all these continents
05:09 that have torn apart from each other and
05:11 when you shrink and get rid of all the
05:12 oceans if you were to if you were
05:14 literally to to take a globe your
05:17 average globe on earth hopefully Peter
05:19 projection map glowed but any globe and
05:21 you wrap it in leather completely and
05:25 then you cut away right where the
05:28 continents are everything that's ocean
05:31 you throw that part of the leather away
05:32 you should be able to come up with a
05:34 fairly decent it'll be a little wobbly
05:36 because things have stretched and turns
05:37 just a little bit as they scoot it
05:39 around as the new surface created itself
05:42 from the bowels of the earth you'd be
05:45 able make a little soccer ball no
05:48 subduction no shrinkage you know maybe
05:51 there's erosion due to the ocean
05:52 existing for the first time but it's
05:54 gonna be minimal if you need to cut it
05:58 by a quarter-inch of leather that where
06:00 the oceans are that we give yourself a
06:02 little bit the erosion back when I see
06:05 the deserts of South Arizona which is
06:09 featured in West world and you see those
06:12 plateaus that go way up you're looking
06:13 at ancient earth that's the old surface
06:15 of the earth up there when you see all
06:19 the tilted you know formations on the
06:21 earth looking at old earth that has sunk
06:25 into the ground because it ripped and
06:28 when it ripped corrosion from rain and
06:30 everything got in there and eventually
06:31 it fell in word it would just happen
06:36 does happen but that's not what the
06:40 episodes about I'm not trying to go one
06:42 way or the other what I'm gonna try to
06:45 address is this I hate to even say it
06:50 because it's such a used up phrase
06:52 nowadays and it's being used for things
06:54 that are absurd I think in a lot of
06:56 instances but this this intolerance of
06:59 each other's opinions now again someone
07:02 who comes in and says look man I'm
07:04 tolerant but Jesus Christ when I go to
07:06 your Facebook page there's like you know
07:08 eighty percent flat earth posts and
07:11 almost no globe representation
07:13 whatsoever
07:14 and so it's bias and this and for people
07:19 that think that it's a PSYOP from some
07:23 Intelligence Agency well you might be
07:25 right I don't know she I don't belong to
07:27 those organizations I sure as [ __ ]
07:28 and paid to do this show so you have a
07:32 point
07:33 you know I it's like my moderators are
07:36 watching this you know and if I said to
07:40 them look okay well maybe we should pull
07:42 back a little bit on you know just
07:43 pounding the feed with one species of
07:45 post which is all flatters I'm sure
07:47 they're getting the point by themselves
07:49 then I'm kind of like riding that fine
07:52 line of censorship within the within the
07:54 channel I think perhaps we could do
07:57 something about equal representation but
07:59 wouldn't it suck to have to go I got a
08:01 really group like let's say on a
08:03 particular day someone has been
08:06 gathering really funny memes about Flat
08:09 Earth and they post it up on some
08:10 alternative web site our moderator sees
08:12 it drags them all down they literally
08:14 are gut-busting lee funny memes and now
08:16 that guy's like well okay I gotta wait
08:19 for Monday is this post and Tuesday is
08:21 that post and if no one posting thing
08:23 between my post and the next post it's
08:25 gonna look like I'm still being biased
08:27 and it's all flat earth I really don't
08:29 want to play that game
08:30 I want my moderators to feel comfortable
08:34 now do I find someone who's a globe or
08:36 make them moderator what moderators are
08:38 hard to find people that are that have
08:40 that empathy of an audience and they're
08:43 into the show a lot you know I picked
08:46 two and gentlemen who have a history of
08:48 watching every single episode that's
08:50 ever been made maybe even a couple of
08:53 them two or three times and that way
08:54 when they look at content they know I've
08:57 done an episode and they can kind of
08:58 link it up so if you're a globe or let's
09:01 put that way and you have a good
09:03 temperament you're not going to get all
09:05 pissed off and have some goddamn posting
09:08 war with the other moderators you know
09:11 maybe you submit your information in
09:12 your case to me through the deepmind
09:13 account that is my personal account
09:16 that's right there on the page but
09:19 before we go there just think about this
09:23 because I'm trying to figure out why in
09:25 my heart I have no problem with the
09:28 even though I don't believe it i-it's a
09:33 very similar situation to my friends
09:34 that believe in Jesus Christ and find
09:36 all of their salvation and daily motive
09:39 operation through their belief in Jesus
09:41 and the Bible and they're the most
09:43 wonderful people I would trust them with
09:45 anything in my life in fact I'm more
09:48 than just trust them I might call on
09:50 them because there's such wonderful
09:53 human beings and they derive their
09:54 morality from a story but I think is the
09:57 story inspired by God oh yeah absolutely
10:00 but aren't all stories that are good
10:02 with truth and parables in them but now
10:06 what would be let's say that I am gonna
10:08 play a fictional character and I'm this
10:09 new madhuri that comes in that wants to
10:11 do globe stuff what am i post if i
10:17 wanted to post one legitimate picture of
10:19 Earth from space
10:22 I can't there are none there are none
10:25 the blue marble shot from Apollo 17 is a
10:30 composite shot of a bunch of
10:31 high-altitude planes potentially somehow
10:34 altitude satellites but they still
10:36 screwed up the red sea on the first
10:39 iteration that they fixed it the last
10:42 shot that NASA submitted was then a
10:46 composite and the artist that did it did
10:49 an interview with another girl and he
10:50 said the famous phrase what's a
10:52 composite it has to be it's a composite
10:54 it has to be
10:55 why the hell would anyone working for
10:56 NASA say that the only way to get a shot
10:59 of Earth is a composite we got
11:02 geocentric orbit satellites geocentric
11:04 orbit starts around what thirty two
11:07 thousand miles up well that's plenty of
11:10 distance the ball is only seventy nine
11:12 hundred miles across so let's just turn
11:15 that into feet it's divided by a
11:18 thousand all right so 7.9 feet ball and
11:22 you're 32 32 to 36 miles out their feet
11:27 excuse me
11:28 so you have a 8 foot ball and you're
11:31 let's just say 34 feet away do you think
11:33 you could fit that in your iphone shot I
11:35 could why we don't have millions of
11:39 shots per second
11:41 of the earth from space is just
11:45 inexcusable so if I was that person and
11:49 Orrin let's just say I'd take it on
11:50 because I created the show and all this
11:51 other crap what am I gonna post ISS
11:55 shots mm-hmm it's a tall order to fill
12:00 do I just walk around chastising people
12:03 because it's what I learned in school
12:04 well god if I did that I'd be chastising
12:06 everyone who thinks that Lee Harvey
12:08 Oswald didn't kill JFK that official
12:12 history is real history mm-hmm why do I
12:15 personally have no problem and other
12:17 people do I even see examples of things
12:21 and I won't mention them so I do not
12:22 offend any of the listeners people would
12:25 submit it will submit examples to me
12:27 even examples they've worked very hard
12:29 on putting together and I think it's
12:32 silly I think that it doesn't prove
12:34 their point whatsoever
12:35 sometimes I think two people lack some
12:37 basic knowledge of space and and just
12:41 the physics of trajectory reason that
12:45 sort of thing but I so celebrate the
12:47 fact that they're awake they're trying
12:50 the care one of the anxieties that I
12:54 dealt with which was almost a PTSD kind
12:57 of hidden anxiety and myself I had this
12:59 anxiety without a source when it came to
13:02 the moon mission stuff when I first
13:04 started talking to it to people way
13:05 before there was this massive movement
13:08 online to to expose it was people would
13:12 treat me as if I want things to be bad
13:15 like I wanted things to be all upside
13:19 down and then I'm the special Savior I'm
13:21 the Paul Revere who comes in on his
13:23 horse and I'm saving everyone you know
13:26 Alex Jones has said it several times
13:28 he'd rather be doing something else than
13:31 his show now I'm not convinced that's
13:32 the case I'm not convinced his ego can
13:35 handle not being famous
13:38 I'm sure he's used to making millions of
13:40 dollars now too but I think everyone has
13:43 that inside them who's sort of in the
13:45 conspiracy world where you devote a lot
13:47 of time to it now again this show should
13:49 be able to exist without any
13:50 conspiracies at all because there's all
13:52 kinds of social issues and existential
13:55 issue
13:55 that we can focus on it's a weird thing
13:58 to be standing next to two groups that
14:00 disagree so vehement Lee and I you know
14:04 I want to say some people and and I want
14:06 to make sure that the for the
14:08 individuals that know that they express
14:09 themselves and that you were frustrated
14:12 I want to make sure that you don't feel
14:14 alienated by this episode this is just
14:17 us coming together at the Thanksgiving
14:19 dinner or maybe just a good old meal we
14:21 all love each other we're sitting at the
14:23 dinner table and I'm just talking I'm
14:25 the the uncle sitting on the corner on
14:29 the end over there so don't feel weird
14:31 if you think this is directed at you if
14:34 you find yourself in this I know there's
14:36 plenty of folks that are kind of on the
14:38 fence and some folks that are globes but
14:41 they do enjoy it like me they enjoy the
14:42 other debate like I said in a previous
14:45 episode the people that I hang out with
14:49 are unbelievably frank about them
14:56 believing that it's flat earth they
14:58 never talk about it
14:59 they never talk about it but when I
15:01 bring it up they'll go well I think it's
15:03 flat and these are brilliant people with
15:06 like amazing careers in sciences and so
15:10 I'm like that's cool you know it's kind
15:13 of wild you know the other thing is when
15:15 they say that they're not the people to
15:18 go home in marathon 20 YouTube shows to
15:21 confirm it they just seen enough the
15:24 reason why I want to bring this up
15:27 outside of just the little bit of
15:29 discussion that's gone on the Facebook
15:31 channel and again some of these comments
15:33 that are coming in a brand new guy
15:37 joined I don't know if he joined the
15:38 channel but he made a comment tonight
15:41 we're episode 352 at the time I'm
15:43 recording this he said that he came to
15:47 the Facebook and the channel and it's
15:50 his belief that I am towing a lot of
15:53 baby bloomer targeted memes and so it
15:57 sort of for him is lacking the
16:00 intellectual discussion that he wanted
16:03 the channel at least the Facebook page
16:05 to have and some of that's my fault
16:07 because I don't have enough
16:08 to do everything I'm doing right now in
16:10 my life and really engage in deep
16:12 conversations now most of you know that
16:14 I reply to almost every single human
16:16 being on the YouTube channel try try to
16:19 give intelligent responses I'm
16:21 definitely getting more time at this
16:23 point exactly to get into the Facebook
16:25 post which is cool I typically try to
16:30 steer away from some of the dark stuff
16:31 so you know I'm as amazed as you with
16:35 weird you know crises that happen in the
16:38 world where it seems like there's some
16:40 [ __ ] going on and you know I've lost
16:43 a lot of my life to a lot of the
16:46 darkness out there and I'm sort of done
16:47 with that phase so again the motto of
16:49 this show is to help the world rebuild
16:52 from the bottom up because I think that
16:55 we were ready and were able to do it but
16:59 I'm not sure we have when I say ready
17:01 were psychologically ready but perhaps
17:05 we don't have all of the answers that
17:07 would kind of get us to the next level
17:09 so I don't know what the percentages are
17:11 there's a lot of brilliant wise people
17:13 out there unfortunately they don't all
17:14 have channels on YouTube some of them do
17:17 and they're just not exactly the best
17:18 communicators so I think I have a gift
17:20 of communication so I'm going to do my
17:22 best to harvest maybe some of the more
17:28 less articulate or less polished
17:31 individuals and I'll move it into this
17:33 format restructure it's such that it's
17:36 it's digested properly by people that
17:40 really want to to get the core wisdom
17:43 out of it right
17:43 but this archetype of being frustrated
17:48 with flatterers versus globe earth is an
17:51 archetype that is going to occur it has
17:53 been occurring for a really really long
17:54 time in any debate that's out there is
17:59 there a God
18:00 well you're gonna have people do the
18:01 same thing it was Jesus real or fake
18:03 same thing are there where it was
18:06 Roswell real and then alien was
18:08 recovered same thing so in order to make
18:12 sure that we don't stall such that you
18:16 know the tires spinning and we're not
18:18 going anywhere I think we have to figure
18:22 out a way
18:22 to deal with that frustration and what
18:27 you know part of me is sort of happy
18:30 that someone's frustrated because it
18:31 shows their internal core their devotion
18:34 to the truth that's important to me
18:38 that's a good person now if that person
18:41 were to come in and post a bunch of
18:43 weird chili crap which we don't have any
18:45 of those kind of people then I might
18:46 change my opinion but we don't have
18:48 those kind of people quite the opposite
18:51 so I you know I debated to getting on
18:54 the Facebook page and posting a giant
18:56 article covering this but I thought hey
18:58 man why don't we just make an episode
18:59 because I think it has value over the
19:01 long term you know one of the key
19:04 examples that I give to my normal sort
19:08 of moderate Democrat friends which are
19:12 the normal Democrats normal human beings
19:14 that just think that that parties for
19:15 them they haven't done a bunch of
19:16 research on and figured out its links to
19:19 very heinous stuff in this world but
19:23 they mean well they mean well they want
19:27 the same world that we want they just
19:30 differ on how to get it
19:31 some folks wait you know I actually
19:33 don't think moderate or Democrats
19:35 believe in socialism or communism I
19:37 don't think that's the case I really
19:38 don't think that as soon as you believe
19:40 in socialism you're a communist and
19:42 you're a progressive and you're dumb as
19:45 [ __ ] that's what I think we can not a we
19:48 never have that on planet earth until we
19:50 can achieve it in the way that Gene
19:51 Roddenberry figured it out
19:53 but if money exists the way it exists
19:57 today you absolutely can't have a
19:59 dictator a monarch a communist Tea Party
20:02 or socialistic government you can't pull
20:05 it off you can try it and you can do it
20:07 but you'll fail it will end in tears I
20:11 know it you know so I don't want to lose
20:14 the camaraderie that we have that is
20:17 more productive and more valuable than
20:19 our disagreements but disagreements are
20:22 how we get things figured out it's how
20:24 we decipher things I think when the
20:26 disagreement reaches a level of you you
20:30 need to blow off steam that is also
20:34 actually not too bad but when that
20:36 steam ceases to produce itself and you
20:39 you you get more and more frustrated
20:41 over time such that you sort of lose
20:44 yourself then that's where I think we
20:48 need to stop talking for a little while
20:50 look at each other and kind of start
20:53 grinning because that's the next thing
20:54 we're going to do and then we go back
20:58 into when you start over we start trying
21:00 to repurpose the way that we communicate
21:02 what's frustrating us so I think that we
21:07 all mean well we really want the truth
21:09 and I think that the the breaking point
21:12 as far as I understand it for folks that
21:14 get angry at the flatterer thing is when
21:16 they believe for a collection of reasons
21:19 that it's a PSYOP once you believe it's
21:22 a PSYOP you want the sigh off to stop
21:25 and so you want people to be quiet
21:27 because they're carrying the agenda in
21:29 your mind of an alphabet agency trying
21:33 to mess with us and it may be it may be
21:36 a sign up there's the paper and I forgot
21:39 what the name of it was because it's
21:41 been a while since I read the title of
21:42 it but it was something like some
21:45 cognitive dissidence projects and you
21:48 know someone submitted this document on
21:50 the internet with the one of the
21:52 alphabet agencies as the author of the
21:53 document which believe me I can make one
21:56 of those any day they went to day that
21:58 weekend you'd believe every goddamn word
21:59 of it you put it on a [ __ ] reddit
22:02 account and it gets digested like it was
22:04 real but it said that they were going to
22:07 create this sort of program such that
22:11 you couldn't focus on what was real
22:15 which is going to completely disorients
22:17 aasaiya t make society get off on the
22:20 wrong track and therefore suffer more
22:23 slings and arrows while you're being
22:24 disrupted while you're being sort of
22:28 misdirected towards this Flat Earth
22:30 thing
22:31 now when Flat Earth was super duper hot
22:33 a year ago plus people got sidetracked
22:37 they went often made well will be
22:39 Rockets they made you know weather
22:42 balloons and tried to fly things up
22:43 trying to find the curvature of the
22:45 earth without doing the math for
22:46 and I can see where someone would say
22:51 look there it is
22:52 now the other tact on this would be that
22:54 it's creating a divide again when
22:57 someone gets angry either one way or the
22:59 other there are flat earther getting
23:00 angry but their globe are getting earth
23:02 angry and they lose a friend they lose a
23:04 relationship they become more isolated
23:07 well if there really are crazy people
23:11 walking in public places shooting people
23:13 isolation is definitely the portfolio of
23:18 that person's mind so you don't want
23:22 that either you want your Sims social
23:26 bar to be green in full constantly
23:28 what's interesting is is that the
23:31 conspiracies they always get a backstory
23:36 don't think because I think a conspiracy
23:38 always has a backstory in the end you
23:41 know why did they kill somebody it has a
23:44 backstory he's got a reason Sathish is
23:46 supposedly murdered because he gave away
23:49 DNC emails to WikiLeaks
23:52 you know JFK is murdered for a million
23:54 reasons etc down the line so with the
23:57 Flat Earth thing the conspiracy behind
23:59 it in a pro way is that God is sitting
24:04 over the firmament and we are being
24:06 abstracted away from God
24:08 through this heliocentric model which
24:11 sort of perpetuates the total
24:13 perspective vortex from The Hitchhiker's
24:14 Guide of the galaxy or infinitely small
24:16 and insignificant in the universe which
24:19 is a ludicrous interpretation of
24:22 heliocentric model because so God has to
24:25 be small before God can be powerful got
24:29 us to be literally like breathing on the
24:31 back here neck before he really exists
24:33 and carries it but your your well being
24:35 that doesn't make any sense
24:36 if God is infinitely omnipotent
24:38 knowledgable okay well then it doesn't
24:41 matter how big your number is in the
24:43 infinite number system he's aware of
24:45 your existence and he does what he does
24:47 and for the ladies I say he only as a
24:51 typical reference something that gives
24:54 birth is a she so
24:55 I understand the debate there women stop
25:00 me everyone small oh you said he oh my
25:02 god you [ __ ] offended down again
25:04 here's a background so you know in a
25:06 friend and you extorted something out of
25:07 me because you got offended cool chicks
25:11 don't do that now the flip negative side
25:14 to Flat Earth is the SIOP thing you're
25:17 being led astray kept ignorant to the
25:20 world to make you look like a fool in
25:23 public and making you look gullible so
25:25 all this social media once won
25:27 Zuckerberg debuts this bug which opens
25:30 up everyone's private chat that you've
25:32 ever had with someone's wife or or
25:33 something you've said an inward some
25:36 where you've done something
25:37 inappropriate
25:38 you're joking you're not really maybe
25:40 weren't joking or someone wasn't joking
25:41 to you everyone can see everyone's
25:43 background I'll be this black Monday
25:46 that's gonna happen with Facebook and
25:47 one day just to screw up the entire
25:50 world as he just says [ __ ] it but then
25:53 all this descent and craziness will be
25:57 exposed and everyone will be struggling
25:59 to get a job if they didn't do the the
26:02 China China's social rating system
26:05 properly mu where you coward it down you
26:08 went away from things that you believed
26:10 because someone else was bullying you
26:11 and calling your names in some other
26:13 post so on the flip side of the globe
26:16 side you have this observable science
26:20 that we believe astronomy leads to
26:21 cosmology physics is still completely
26:24 [ __ ] on the official side because
26:26 gravity is a phenomenon if you come over
26:28 to electrical universe it all makes
26:30 sense but we think we're seeing this we
26:34 don't usually and I shouldn't say we too
26:37 heavily but in the science side of
26:39 things the quote unquote official
26:40 science thing no one's trying to say
26:43 we're insignificant in the universe
26:44 simply because there's a lot of universe
26:46 out there it just simply is the way that
26:49 man's hubris gets injured from feeling
26:51 important so the defense mechanism is to
26:53 retreat to a methodology of belief that
26:56 keeps us at the center of the universe
26:57 and right next to God I'm gonna say this
27:02 if you believe in a god you should
27:06 always feel very close to God all the
27:08 time
27:09 all day long you don't need another man
27:11 to get the God you don't need a church
27:14 to get to God you don't need a savior to
27:17 be forgiven by God if there is even such
27:20 a thing as sin that is so horrible that
27:23 God wouldn't be able to forgive you
27:25 instantaneously he made you he gave you
27:27 all the experiences you've had and if
27:30 God exists like then if you beat your
27:33 kid up and then your kid starts hurting
27:35 animals and then beating his girlfriend
27:37 up well you did that you you're the one
27:39 that's created that situation so you're
27:41 you surprised
27:42 no you created that situation well if
27:45 God puts you in the slum Dogz of India
27:47 and you don't exactly become the most
27:49 happy kid although those kids look
27:50 pretty happy in that weird world which
27:53 is good I guess there's no other choice
27:55 well you would know what he put you up
27:59 against if you'd become a stone cold Ted
28:03 Bundy he knows that you have a mental
28:06 problem you got a tumor inside your
28:08 brain pushing on the happy button
28:10 turning it off let me push it on the
28:12 angry button so what's the flip side of
28:14 the globe side who would create the
28:17 globe theory in order to gain power and
28:20 control over mankind well as far as I've
28:24 been able to deduce it's all blamed on
28:26 the Jesuits it's interesting I can go my
28:30 entire life rarely ever hearing that
28:32 phrase and then all of a sudden they're
28:34 responsible for genuinely generally
28:36 everything that's horrible in the
28:37 universe including this birthing of
28:39 agloe birth when you really study globe
28:43 earth you find out that a lot of
28:46 societies had a globe earth model the
28:49 Babylonians have history of globe earth
28:51 the Egyptians definitely had it figured
28:54 out again the symbol for a year is a
28:59 filled up circle with a circle around it
29:03 meaning the earth went around the Sun
29:05 the symbol for a month was an empty
29:08 circle surrounded by a circle indicating
29:10 either earth or perhaps a completely
29:13 waned out moon okay seems like they had
29:18 to figure it out too well they certainly
29:20 had the starters figured out didn't they
29:22 did they feel insignificant I don't
29:26 think so
29:26 I bet they felt pretty good when they
29:28 built three massive pyramids that were
29:30 shining like nothing we've ever seen you
29:33 know one white one black and one red
29:35 with perhaps like a gold-plated para
29:38 Meridian stone at the top I mean wow
29:40 awesome do you remember when George
29:43 Carlin did his bit about Earth and he
29:47 said that maybe Earth made man because
29:49 earth wanted plastic and that eventually
29:53 the earth will just shrugged shoulders
29:55 and man will disappear and depending on
29:58 what earth wants next I'll create
29:59 another species to create that object
30:01 for Earth it's a hilarious routine but
30:06 now what would we be doing let's just
30:09 say from the religious side which is
30:12 more of the firmament dome side to be
30:14 angry at someone that we think is being
30:16 co-opted by a Jesuit program to make
30:18 everyone believe that the world is a
30:20 tiny ball in space insignificant which
30:23 is a subjective analysis by man we're
30:27 sort of taking the tact that we are
30:29 coming to the rescue of God God needs
30:32 man to rescue God because without man
30:35 doing so faith in God will disappear and
30:38 when faith and God disappears then God
30:41 Himself disappears as if God is that
30:44 frail that dependent on the belief
30:46 systems and the frequencies in the mind
30:48 of man hmm
30:50 I don't know know if I buy that it seems
30:54 that if you believe in God that God lets
30:56 the world go to a certain level of
30:58 infection diseased thinking and then God
31:05 well he brings a little finale down for
31:08 mankind right back in Noah's days he
31:10 flooded the whole joint and just saved a
31:12 boat with some animals on it Moses his
31:15 time he killed everyone by the calf
31:18 Sodom and Gomorrah that whole story
31:21 burns down a city seems like he resets
31:24 things if things get really bad okay
31:29 it's God gonna let it go to a point
31:31 where man I don't know it gets more
31:33 powerful than God seems ridiculous
31:35 so maybe we don't need to save God hmm
31:39 but perhaps the thinking goes a little
31:42 deeper and this is what's kind of
31:45 strange
31:46 it would seem beyond the shadow of a
31:50 doubt that the the evil people that run
31:53 this planet believe in Satan Lucifer
31:58 they are the illuminated ones and their
32:02 mind they know what is right and we
32:04 don't to believe in Satan you believe in
32:07 God if you believe in God and Satan then
32:09 you most likely believe in Jesus Christ
32:11 which is sort of hard for me to believe
32:13 that they would believe in Jesus maybe
32:17 they think it is just good and evil and
32:19 one is called God and one is called the
32:20 devil hmm and so you may see it as a
32:25 holy war well if the devil slash the
32:30 Jesuits are trying to make man lose
32:34 faith in what is positive and good and
32:36 true which would be a flat disc somehow
32:39 suspended in this planet suspended in
32:42 space completely contradicting
32:46 everything else that we can see in space
32:48 and you can say the moon is a flat disc
32:51 it does have again perspective on the
32:54 volcanic craters that are all over the
32:56 surface the Sun rotates we can watch
32:59 that so we know that's a ball for some
33:03 reason we're different
33:04 seems weird I'm deciding right now that
33:07 I'm going to put out planets in this
33:09 episode where planets is the secondary
33:11 and this is the primary that should give
33:15 you something to look at for a night or
33:17 two
33:18 what's it you're seeing to me that if
33:20 you went that tact and I'm not saying
33:22 any of you've gone any of these paths
33:24 but this is sort of the sort of
33:28 freestyle Association I find with these
33:29 subjects I would suggest that one might
33:35 spend more time trying to petition away
33:40 Churches of Satan opening up in various
33:43 major cities statues of Satan being
33:46 erected where they use like a
33:50 non-american to make the statue like
33:52 they used this Japanese artist
33:54 the last one I saw he probably has no
33:56 affiliation with Christianity or
33:59 Satanism at all
34:00 he's just been hired so they abstract
34:02 away any personal consciousness or I
34:06 should say moral imperative to do right
34:08 he doesn't care he doesn't believe in
34:10 either's [ __ ] things white people
34:11 are crazy so he takes our money and
34:14 builds the statue of scene well the
34:16 mantra of Satanism is human sacrifice it
34:19 really is the light of your face about
34:21 it but it's true you kids start
34:24 disappearing if one of those churches
34:25 shows up in your neighborhood I cover
34:27 that my Satanism episode okay you're
34:32 gonna really worry about whether the
34:33 [ __ ] place is flat or round you want
34:36 a battle for God I'm gonna say that is
34:39 probably the most acutely accurate thing
34:43 you could petition heighten the
34:44 awareness of those things start studying
34:46 the crime records before the church was
34:49 created and after the church was created
34:51 study how many kids disappear how many
34:53 wife's disappear see if there's any data
34:56 that correlates there if you want to
34:58 fight a holy war there are very specific
35:00 places that are very specific and in
35:05 your face all day long now let's go back
35:08 onto the globe side looking at the Flat
35:11 Earth side what are you worried about
35:15 hmm well you're probably let's say this
35:21 much if you come from the camp or you
35:22 think it's a PSYOP then you probably are
35:25 sick and tired of psyops you're sick and
35:27 tired of these people getting their way
35:29 messing with the minds of people and so
35:32 if you think you're looking at a PSYOP
35:34 you're pissed you're like guys stop
35:37 feeding into this you're going right
35:38 back into the the belly of the beast
35:41 you're doing their bidding by promoting
35:44 this ludicrous disc surrounded by ice
35:47 thing so many of your theories are
35:50 supposed to be ironclad but you can't
35:52 produce any of the evidence like for
35:55 instance the gyroscope inside of a plane
35:57 that flies from England to Cairo from
36:02 Minneapolis Minnesota to Mexico City any
36:06 of those northbound things Japan to
36:08 Sydney you should be able to prove
36:11 beyond the shadow of a doubt but the
36:12 gyroscope in your lap that it didn't
36:15 rotate and therefore you're on a flat
36:18 earth I'm waiting I'm waiting
36:21 somebody's got ten grand to pull that
36:23 off you're gonna buy the ticket you're
36:25 gonna have some scientists at a local
36:27 university help you build a gyroscope
36:29 that matches exactly the kind of
36:31 gyroscopes are in the dashboard of the
36:32 plane there's got to be a pilot out
36:35 there who flies this every single day
36:36 who believes that this world is flat and
36:40 how many times have you seen the
36:41 interview I mentioned this before
36:42 several times how many times do you see
36:44 in the interview there's a UK one it's
36:47 really seems reputable the guy's a
36:48 British accent seems like he's telling
36:50 the truth but he says oh man the
36:51 gyroscopes don't rotate when we fly
36:54 around okay fine take a goddamn picture
36:59 would you because that is the part of
37:01 the game I've never seen but if you
37:04 really want to do it right you time the
37:07 flight let's I don't know what it takes
37:09 to get to to Cairo from England or
37:13 whatever these flights might be these
37:14 North and South flights but you bring a
37:17 camera with you a camcorder or your
37:19 telephone Vic has enough power and
37:22 enough memory to hold the video this
37:25 camera would probably not be good
37:28 because I can only do about two hours
37:30 get your little 1080p camera out or
37:33 something and record it
37:34 don't stop the camera maybe build it
37:36 into the contraption look yourself in
37:39 the face film a watch film the news on
37:41 your phone or whatever reload the
37:43 website cnn.com/fareed is proved it's
37:46 that time of day stick the camera in
37:48 there without turning it off film film
37:50 film you land you pull it out you film
37:53 outside there's Cairo you film your face
37:54 you film the website again and you turn
37:57 it off boom proof proof no more debate
38:00 anymore wouldn't you love to win that
38:02 argument once and for all
38:04 but now let's let's take it one step
38:09 further because I don't think we've ever
38:11 talked about this one okay
38:14 yeah now this last section I'm gonna
38:20 just randomly pick one of the sides
38:21 because I'm picking one of the sides
38:23 first you know I think I have a
38:24 predisposition towards that side don't
38:28 think I'm picking on your side I'm gonna
38:31 pick the flat earth side first somehow
38:34 some way there's a new set of
38:37 experiments it's not in any agency that
38:42 you don't trust it's independent people
38:44 perhaps even people that were on your
38:46 side and they conduct an experiment I'm
38:51 not personally I don't even know what
38:53 this experiment could be but they prove
38:56 the place is round prove it they used to
39:00 be like you
39:01 they spent maybe five years like you and
39:05 then they said oh my god it's this look
39:09 maybe they maybe they do the gyroscope
39:13 thing and it rotates
39:14 maybe they somehow convinced the
39:18 governments that have the treaty that
39:19 says you can't go to the South Pole
39:20 without permission which should just
39:23 make you think a little bit and they fly
39:26 over it continuous camera everyone's
39:29 invited mark sergeant's on the goddamn
39:30 thing and he's like holy [ __ ] we just
39:32 flew over the South Pole it really is
39:34 only 11,000 a thousand miles around on
39:36 average okay time to pack it up it's a
39:39 round ball mmm
39:43 would we be ready in the Flat Earth side
39:46 of the game to accept that what would it
39:50 take what would it take to prove to you
39:52 flat earthers that the place is round
39:55 would you have a counter excuse every
39:57 single time because well this was in you
39:59 know he burped and he sneezed and that
40:01 means that this is still potentially a
40:03 flat disc or that was all CG mark
40:07 Sargent got bought out he's a shill and
40:09 so of course he flipped to the other
40:11 side and it's the last step of any great
40:14 conspiracy is that they they lead a
40:16 bunch of people in and then boom they
40:18 got you you know it's like hey come on
40:20 inside this Fema camp it's really cool
40:22 it's really fun we play cards and just a
40:26 bunch of rock and roll insects inside
40:28 shut the door and they started gassing
40:29 everybody but would you be ready
40:32 wouldn't you be ready for that reality
40:34 and what would it take now let's go the
40:37 other side ball earth gyroscope comes in
40:41 and ain't rotating no matter what anyone
40:44 tries to do they cannot fly over the
40:46 South Pole
40:46 it just won't allow it maybe somebody
40:51 does a rogue project and it's funny
40:54 because people are starting to talk
40:55 about this now you get a bunch of money
40:57 you get a ship you get a crane you hit
41:01 the coast of the South Pole or
41:03 Antarctica where it's least inhabited
41:06 they clean up a bunch of snowmobiles and
41:11 everyone just starts hauling ass and he
41:14 run right into a [ __ ] wall there it
41:16 is baby dink dink dink it's a it's a
41:20 wall the place is we are in a cage we
41:24 don't have all the explanations for the
41:26 planets the moon and the stars and the
41:28 Milky Way and the Sun but there's a
41:30 barrier here previously undiscovered
41:34 that old story of the woman that left
41:36 her snowmobile and said I found the edge
41:39 I'm out of here see you later and the
41:42 course they set all of her footage from
41:43 her 35-millimeter camera that she took
41:45 on the other side of this barrier was
41:48 all exposed and you know they lost it or
41:50 whatever would you be ready to hear that
41:53 it's a flat disk the debates been going
41:56 on for years in a different realm a
41:59 bunch of different rooms same goes for
42:01 the moon hoax but one of the biggest
42:06 debates of the same magnitude I think is
42:09 in the notion of extraterrestrial life
42:13 now it's one thing to say well of course
42:15 I think there's some there's life out
42:17 there just has to be life out there I
42:19 love that one there just has to be life
42:21 out there I'm like yeah okay well have
42:24 you studied Roswell because you should
42:26 you should really get into all the
42:29 eyewitness testimonies the people that
42:32 live with these people that saw that
42:33 stuff the fact that they were utterly
42:34 scarred for their entire life as they
42:36 were trying to make sense of what the
42:38 hell they saw was that guy on his
42:40 deathbed with his daughter and his son
42:42 he
42:42 said look there they were creatures man
42:44 and they didn't look he was terrified of
42:47 it he just had no frame of mine to deal
42:50 with it 1947 I mean the day there stood
42:52 still hadn't even come out yet I think
42:55 that was 51
42:56 that was their Buck Rogers and comic
42:59 books sure a little bit different to see
43:01 it in the flesh I'm sure her suppose she
43:04 was walking around you know
43:05 telepathically talking to you it sucks
43:08 when you know that there's this binary
43:11 choice this left or right choice and one
43:14 of you has to be wrong if it's not a
43:17 matrix this is where the matrix guys are
43:20 up there you know Miles Davis is up
43:21 there playing and he's like you guys
43:24 will figure it out eventually you know
43:26 you're both right it's whatever you want
43:29 the universe to be is what God allows it
43:31 to be and that's the greatest gift he's
43:33 given you is that you manifest your own
43:34 reality the Mandela facts well is simply
43:38 man reconciling all their differences
43:40 well I remembered it this way well I
43:42 remembered it that way well how should
43:44 we remember it today then because it's
43:46 only gonna be one way well I guess I
43:48 guess I'll give it to you your dude is
43:50 the one that invented that and my
43:52 childhood was different than I thought
43:53 it was was Berenstein berenstain bears
43:56 well with Berenstain seems to be where
43:58 it's at today there was slightly more of
44:00 you baron staying people in the
44:02 universal and the internet launched and
44:04 created a consensus reality it just
44:07 simply flopped to the one with more
44:09 memories and that spelling your memories
44:13 were erased but isn't it funny you still
44:16 have access to it for me I'm just a
44:18 digress and I have said this I don't
44:20 know half a dozen times I apologize but
44:23 I have to tell you that the I was in
44:28 second grade I think was going to
44:31 Fairfield grade school in shinnou Kansas
44:36 and it was the day they told me that Li
44:38 Whitney was a black guy who invented the
44:40 cotton gin and I remember just thinking
44:44 about that just and what irony was a
44:46 member the word irony was an intriguing
44:48 word to me that was sort of such an
44:50 adult world word that I couldn't really
44:52 grab
44:53 but irony was and that was the very
44:56 first time I already made sense to me it
44:58 was such an epiphany moment a Eureka
45:01 moment in language in and sort of
45:03 abstract thought that there was this
45:06 black man my world in my history solves
45:12 a cotton-picking problem but today it's
45:15 a white guy for me Oh fascinating
45:19 for me it's extremely real now could all
45:22 my teachers have it wrong I don't know I
45:24 asked two guys here like I said
45:25 California same exact date was like a
45:28 Hollywood [ __ ] moment my friend in
45:32 front of me seventy years old I think he
45:34 might have been 71 guy behind him I
45:36 think was about 56 it's just the two of
45:40 us we're in this special studio up in El
45:45 Segundo I'm surrounded by just a crazy
45:48 amazing electronics and so I've got this
45:51 wall of LEDs showing all this wild stuff
45:54 behind this huge editing lab in front of
45:56 me it was just literally out of a movie
45:57 it's it's like a soundstage for LED
46:00 design and I said you know if you guys
46:03 heard about the Menil effect no I'm okay
46:06 well what is it and I said well let me
46:07 give you a little test and I said what
46:09 do you guys remember about the guy that
46:11 created the cotton gin well it's Eli
46:15 Whitney they both knew it right away I
46:17 said what do you remember about that guy
46:19 what's one attribute about that guy
46:20 ain't my buddy my business partner and
46:22 one of my best friends the entire world
46:25 who's extremely brain extremely famous
46:27 and extremely accomplished he just looks
46:29 at me he goes fact both of them said at
46:32 the exact same time as a matter of fact
46:33 it was almost in unison that was the
46:34 crazy part they both said well I
46:36 remember what I remember he was a black
46:38 guy I was like I was validated I was
46:44 like damn and I'm not crazy
46:46 this isn't a bunch of bumpkin teachers
46:49 in the Midwest who simply didn't know
46:50 the history this was a giant part of the
46:54 game in California my buddy was raised
46:58 as a matter of fact he was raised in
47:00 Japan just a few miles out from
47:02 Hiroshima after the bomb dropped and
47:05 then he was raised also in Salt Lake
47:07 a bunch of other places his father was a
47:10 test pilot when he was young the other
47:13 gentleman I don't know his background
47:14 but he's he was the one that owned the
47:17 place
47:17 so he's extremely capable and smart you
47:21 know if this was a black mirror if this
47:23 episode turned into a black mirror where
47:25 we built up over the course of one hour
47:27 the factions in and through the course
47:30 of the black mirror the pros and cons
47:33 the foreign against models of each
47:35 conspiracy of both a flat earth disk and
47:37 the globe earth people they they would
47:43 come together and of course this is jazz
47:44 band playing the whole time this sort of
47:46 other group that's undefined we don't
47:49 know exactly what they believe but they
47:50 seem to have that sort of like really
47:53 cool you know we know what's going on
47:55 and eventually you'll know what we like
47:57 you don't know our opinion but
47:58 eventually in the in the final act of
48:00 this show you're gonna find out what we
48:03 believe and it turns out it's a matrix
48:06 and as soon as the fight starts as soon
48:10 as the first fist is is thrown or some
48:12 weapon fires all of a sudden all that
48:16 just reality starts ripping and maybe
48:19 what we do is we build up the jazz music
48:21 it starts getting really intense it's
48:22 audible right where the fights about to
48:24 occur in some you know 1970s Bronx
48:27 bombed out [ __ ] you know I don't know
48:32 some building demolition site which was
48:34 the Bronx back in the day and the jazz
48:37 just gets more and more powerful and
48:38 powerful and powerful until reality
48:40 itself just rips apart and they all find
48:44 out we all find out that we've been
48:47 suckers the whole time that the bias
48:50 that we expressed about what our reality
48:53 was really made of was all proprietary
48:56 to our own desires our weaknesses our
48:59 hubris a scientist feels extremely
49:03 hubris because of their ability to
49:06 accept this standing on shoulders on
49:10 shoulders of previous scientists thus
49:12 coming up with great theories like
49:13 gravity that are phenomenons with the
49:15 traditional science before the ether
49:17 electrical universe comes out
49:19 the flat earth side you're like we just
49:21 simply observed the fact that we don't
49:24 feel like we're moving the planes don't
49:27 have guidance problems when they're
49:29 going north to south you know again in
49:32 if you were in Ontario Canada flying to
49:35 say Mexico City the horizontal velocity
49:40 of which you were traveling goes from
49:42 what 250 miles an hour
49:44 let's just say up by Ontario I'm making
49:46 this up and I think it's the proportion
49:48 down to one thousand miles an hour
49:50 equator Cairo is great cuz it's sitting
49:53 on the equator so you go from Glasgow
49:57 Scotland down to Cairo
50:00 you have just you've just sped up your
50:03 your flesh hundreds and hundreds of
50:07 miles an hour just to get to Cairo
50:09 somehow though the airship that you're
50:13 on doesn't get ripped to shreds the
50:15 plane doesn't tip over because it it
50:18 doesn't have this momentum it doesn't
50:20 fly in a diagonal line somehow the air
50:23 flying over Cairo is going a thousand
50:25 miles an hour and the air over glass
50:27 goes going 250 and there's no problem
50:30 eating through that environment I want
50:33 to know how that works how is that
50:35 speed-up occurring even with my ether a
50:39 model of gravity it as long as the world
50:44 rotates it doesn't make any sense
50:45 because the atmosphere is its own thing
50:48 yes it would seem like Cairo would be
50:51 really windy you know because that
50:53 nothing else you're spinning and you
50:57 know you're gonna get this atmosphere to
50:59 go the same speed as the ground if
51:00 you're gonna have a calm relaxed cool or
51:04 even sunny day there's no wind on you in
51:08 Cairo for that particular day or a week
51:10 or a month that means that the
51:12 atmosphere is moving perfectly a
51:14 thousand miles an hour roughly with the
51:16 surface of the earth and if you just
51:19 start walking let's just say there's an
51:21 ice road going straight to Scotland know
51:25 as you're walking it's all slowing down
51:27 it's all slowing down interesting right
51:33 are we prepared to be wrong because
51:37 somebody's wrong unless it's a matrix
51:41 when I think about the religious wars
51:44 that have occurred on earth it dawned on
51:48 me several years ago several decades ago
51:50 I should say that if there's any truth
51:53 after death there's a whole bunch of
51:55 people they're gonna feel really silly
51:58 that they dedicated their life to a
52:01 crusade that they ever took another
52:05 person's life due to indoctrination of a
52:09 religion you know it's easy for us
52:13 citizens of the world that have never
52:15 been soldiers to flip idli talk about
52:19 killing another human being and the
52:21 justifiable causes that might feed into
52:24 such an opinion we all have these
52:27 opinions sometimes we think that you
52:30 know individuals should be removed from
52:33 this planet because they're too evil
52:34 sometimes we think that some people are
52:37 so mentally disturbed that there's
52:40 really little we can do to to control
52:44 them they can't be sent anywhere in the
52:46 world where they're gonna be at peace
52:48 because they're they're violent they
52:50 don't like what's going on in their
52:52 brain there's nothing we can do and
52:54 there are those out there that believe
52:56 that people are too primitive to be on
52:57 this planet perhaps or too aggressive
53:00 and they're too mean they have been
53:04 abused perhaps in the past and so they
53:06 carry this weird baggage these grudges
53:08 and so they can never be nice to another
53:09 group of people and maybe at one point
53:12 in time that was justifiable but when
53:15 you die if there is an afterlife I'm
53:18 sure there is a sense of what is what
53:21 was right and what was wrong what was
53:22 justified what wasn't justified
53:24 I strive with my personal life to make
53:29 that as painless as possible to cross
53:31 over into the other side
53:33 with you know hopefully a high 90
53:36 percentile rating or percentage I should
53:39 say another reading percentage of I know
53:42 what I did wrong I may not remember
53:45 every specific thing I've done wrong to
53:46 some
53:47 I'm whipping off to somebody I love or
53:49 whatever but in the end I know well when
53:52 I was in my teens I was wrong about this
53:54 when I was in my 20s is wrong about that
53:56 you know there's like a maybe a handful
53:58 of very specific events where I
53:59 absolutely embarrassed myself with my
54:01 own immaturity but I'm aware of it
54:04 that's what I want to have happen when I
54:05 pass and overall my intent was good I
54:10 may have been misguided and misled or
54:12 too impressionable or stupid or even
54:15 developed my own really stupid idea
54:18 about how to communicate you know don't
54:21 think I don't think about some of the
54:23 shows I've made where I've been very
54:24 flip it and and I said things are a
54:28 little harsh part of me is kind of like
54:31 well it's almost like if I was a
54:32 musician instead of making podcasts and
54:35 I made a bunch of albums that were
54:37 really intense you know Trent Reznor's
54:39 first down was all about a breakup he
54:41 had with the girl and he put a lot of
54:43 passion into that and maybe he doesn't
54:46 feel the same way anymore and so he
54:49 listens to his lyrics and he's like oh
54:50 my god
54:51 you know I'm surprised I can get a
54:52 girlfriend today with all the crap I
54:54 said about my ex-girlfriend but as an
54:56 artist you know that you just have to be
54:58 true to yourself as much as you possibly
54:59 can you know that all of your art is a
55:02 stamp of who you were at a particular
55:04 time Prince the artist Prince really
55:07 struggled with this whole thing he did a
55:08 lot of super sexed-up lyrics when he was
55:11 younger and then he became a Jehovah's
55:12 Witness and realized he was embarrassed
55:16 even changed lyrics of his songs when he
55:20 sang him later in life the song sexy
55:23 [ __ ] turned into sexy mama
55:25 father Ridley Scott changed the
55:29 unbelievably powerful line for Rutger
55:33 Hauer character Roy batty in Blade
55:36 Runner from saying I want more life
55:38 [ __ ] - I want more life father it's
55:42 not like he couldn't have said that but
55:44 he wouldn't been able to say it in the
55:45 way he said it he just sounded funky it
55:48 makes sense I mean you know Tyrell
55:50 created him so he was trying to say I
55:51 want more life father and it just didn't
55:55 it just for those of us with a die-hard
55:57 Blade Runner
55:58 it was taking one of the biggest lines
56:02 of the film and sort of pissing it away
56:05 but maybe Ridley Scott had some sort of
56:09 remorse for allowing such a such a
56:12 visceral line to go through his script I
56:15 made all this for a purpose as we
56:18 disagree with each other and as we
56:21 believe that we have identified
56:23 something to fight for
56:24 it has to have some serious perspective
56:28 and that perspective is going to be
56:29 obviously prorated to our own
56:31 intelligence and our own maturity at any
56:33 one point of time how many of you have
56:35 discovered that GMO foods are bad for
56:37 you and then you want to tell the entire
56:39 world you want to get every human being
56:41 off that [ __ ] you find out how fluoride
56:44 gives you osteoporosis rots your teeth
56:46 and clusters in the pineal gland thus
56:49 shutting off your conduit to the
56:53 universe you know I thought of an
56:55 interesting way of describing the left
56:57 brain right brain because I teach it a
56:58 lot from time to time your left brain is
57:01 sort of your tool box that allows you to
57:03 survive on the surface of this planet
57:06 your right brain is designed to give you
57:09 your identity in the universe it is
57:11 literally your coax internet signal to
57:14 God Himself to all knowledge and all
57:17 previous existence probably that is of
57:20 which is to come and that is of which is
57:22 past dictated only by the memory
57:25 mechanisms of life itself we're
57:29 developing a new science and it's called
57:31 awakening think about this in the
57:34 history of mankind have we ever had to
57:37 awake like this in the past I'm sure
57:40 there are moments but I'm not sure there
57:43 has ever been a reverse indoctrination
57:46 moment like the great awakening it's
57:49 unknown territory it would be as if as a
57:53 silly stupid analogy it would be as if
57:56 all the cars of the world disappeared
57:58 and the only cars that are available are
58:01 Formula one cars and so now you've only
58:05 driven a Prius in your lifetime and now
58:08 you're driving a car that can hit 200
58:10 miles an hour if you
58:11 we hold the pedal down long enough in a
58:14 few seconds you're going 200 miles an
58:17 hour lethal speed and so now you are
58:20 trying not to kill yourself just going
58:23 down the street well the danger implied
58:25 in that ridiculous analogy is similar to
58:27 us trying to awaken and become accurate
58:30 all at the same time maybe you think
58:33 it's flat it's a disk as you're trying
58:34 to a week as quickly as possible and
58:37 probably one of the things that you
58:40 never want to do and I should have said
58:41 this a long time ago in this episode but
58:44 if you respect my advice at all let me
58:48 give you a piece of advice and I'm not
58:50 sure a lot of folks do this but
58:52 sometimes it's embedded inside memes and
58:54 this was one of the points of the
58:55 individual that posted on both Facebook
58:59 and I think it's two different
59:00 individuals maybe it's the same person
59:01 but he said very very accurately he goes
59:04 look I don't mind someone necessarily
59:06 having a different opinion than mine but
59:07 I don't want someone to be calling me a
59:10 globe [ __ ] all day long you're insulting
59:14 the fact that I simply have a different
59:16 belief than you now there's there's
59:19 plenty of you know I know what you call
59:23 them insults on both sides of the fence
59:25 little catch words as little phrases
59:27 that they say against each other on both
59:28 sides of the fence
59:30 perhaps that what that's what we'll do
59:32 yeah
59:33 moderators this is what we'll do we will
59:36 make a policy that you can't post
59:39 anything that's calling people's names
59:41 because that's the policy on the YouTube
59:42 channel right you can't come in and just
59:45 simply call everyone
59:47 idiots called me an idiot whatever and
59:49 not contribute something back into the
59:51 system I have no problem with someone
59:54 sitting me down and go alright I got a
59:57 you know like imagine someone from NASA
59:59 showing up in my house and they go you
60:02 better come announced let me just tell
60:04 you that much but you go to my house and
60:06 you've got like a van pulled in with
60:10 filled with a bunch of little boxes and
60:11 you're like okay here's what we're gonna
60:13 do I'm showing up here on Saturday
60:16 morning
60:16 I need your Saturday and I need your
60:18 Sunday I have carefully prepared a bunch
60:22 of little devices some of our really
60:24 elaborate
60:25 but a fuel in them we're gonna take
60:26 about in your back patio where you film
60:28 your show and I'm gonna show you how
60:30 each element of the space mission works
60:32 back in 1969
60:34 I brought the old computers I'm gonna
60:37 let you play with them and I'm gonna
60:38 show you how this was possible and then
60:42 we could talk about your your smoking
60:44 guns whatever you think is a smoking gun
60:45 and I will use one of these little
60:46 machines to show you how this works I
60:49 even brought a spacesuit with the
60:50 backpack and I've got some very hot
60:54 lights that we're gonna shine on you got
60:56 some generators we're gonna fuel up and
60:59 we're just gonna make you on the outside
61:00 you're gonna hold a thermometer in your
61:01 hand it's gonna be 280 degrees
61:03 Fahrenheit and I'm gonna have one
61:05 attached to your back that's gonna ice
61:06 you down and it's gonna be 280 below and
61:08 you're gonna feel fine in this suit but
61:10 you're gonna have proof this is what the
61:11 suits enduring and you're gonna be okay
61:13 and we're gonna do it with the battery
61:15 pack that's inside that little thing on
61:17 your back all with 1969 technology I
61:22 would invite such a thing to occur be a
61:25 hell of a lot of work I think but that
61:27 would be a productive constructive way
61:29 of communicating an opposite theory to
61:31 me so that I might change my mind now
61:33 we're gonna get really anal about people
61:35 slipping and saying these words from
61:37 time to time you know again maybe
61:40 three-strikes-you're-out kind of hears
61:42 up my dad but I hate to do that crap I
61:43 think that sometimes you need to just
61:46 blow steam off and get angry sometimes
61:49 and that's where you get to your healing
61:51 that's where you start to deprioritize
61:53 the way of talking like I've said to you
61:56 guys several times in the
61:57 self-improvement episodes one of the
61:59 best things you can do if you're angry
62:02 at another human being is one you know
62:05 go take a poop and relax a little bit
62:06 give yourself some time if you're still
62:09 passionate about it after maybe half an
62:10 hour's gone by and I again I know that
62:12 there are critical moments in time where
62:14 decisions need to be made very quickly
62:16 and you won't be your best you know
62:18 those are just gonna be moments we're
62:20 gonna you know I would say loosen up
62:22 your mind let the universe flow through
62:24 you and sometimes you'll say things that
62:25 will astound you you will get your point
62:28 across without destroying relationships
62:30 and causing more chaos that you're
62:32 trying to resolve but one of the things
62:34 you can do if you still feel very
62:35 passionate and angry at someone Beach
62:39 ray'll you disagree with him again you
62:42 think they're living for the dark side
62:44 but you're on the right side the light
62:45 side if you live by yourself you can do
62:48 this in your own apartment or if you
62:50 have time to yourself and your own
62:51 dwelling your Dumas I'll talk it out
62:55 yell at that person however you think
62:57 you need to do it try to prove your
63:00 point you know it's just like the little
63:03 exercise show you got the guy's on low
63:04 medium and high and high guy just looked
63:07 crazy you just you know dancing up a
63:09 storm there keep going keep testing your
63:13 theory talk until you can't be mean
63:17 anymore and what'll end up happening if
63:20 you're like me is that you will use ten
63:22 thousand words to be super mean and
63:25 angry and you're you're voicing your
63:27 true inner passion you're not lying
63:29 about it but you're just not being
63:30 polished about it and then what will
63:32 happen typically is you'll find a tenth
63:36 of those words if you said a thousand
63:39 words you'll say 100 words and then
63:41 you'll find 50 words 50 words that you
63:46 can say without getting emotional it's
63:49 like that perfect scene in a dramatic
63:51 movie where someone just says I thought
63:55 you were like this or I I thought you
63:57 understood that we had this commitment
63:59 or whatever your issue is and you will
64:02 get the person to see into your soul
64:04 more accurately more accurately because
64:07 when you're not attacking them so
64:08 they're not on the defense
64:09 you're obviously hurt if you're angry
64:12 and so this is your chance to
64:15 communicate what whatever that other
64:18 person did to you meant now sometimes
64:21 people are ignorant and they simply
64:22 don't have a method of understanding
64:24 what you're saying hey if that's the
64:26 case you probably what the wrong person
64:27 even if they're just your friend
64:29 so thank your lucky stars you identified
64:31 they had an issue and you're able to
64:34 move on now it's disappointing that they
64:36 weren't the fantasy in your head but
64:38 then that's probably your problem and
64:40 not their problem we've all done that
64:42 how many times you've been a
64:44 relationship with someone and within two
64:46 seconds you have thought up some
64:48 incredible life story you're like oh my
64:51 god we're gonna get mayor
64:52 at this place and and we're gonna live
64:55 this life we're gonna have X number of
64:56 kids and pole band I'm a life life is
64:59 gonna be amazing as long as I stay with
65:01 this human being but it's all a fantasy
65:03 in your head the compatibility that you
65:06 think you have you really haven't proven
65:08 it to yourself yet maybe you're
65:10 compatible in category a but you're not
65:13 compatible and category B so you get
65:16 angry at them because they don't live up
65:17 to your fantasy here's the thing that is
65:22 probably the reason why and it took me
65:25 this episode to probably distill this
65:27 out of my mind the flat earth vs. globe
65:30 earth is an amazing sociological
65:34 experiment to see how we react I think
65:39 in the end even if it were a PSYOP that
65:42 the flatterer thing was the situation or
65:45 a PSYOP this globe who are the
65:47 benefactors well those who are on the
65:51 right side of science or right side of
65:53 reality let's just say you're obviously
65:56 gonna be a winner in the category of
65:58 what is right and what is wrong what is
65:59 accurate and what is inaccurate that's
66:01 fine but in the end if you're
66:03 open-minded enough to see the benefits
66:06 you got to see into yourself if you're
66:09 on the losing side how did you get
66:11 deceived why did you get deceived what
66:13 information did you need to have prior
66:16 to being introduced to this concept that
66:18 took you for a ride for however many
66:19 years would have prevented you from
66:21 latching onto it so hardcore if you were
66:24 a sideline person sideline people are
66:28 very interesting they're sitting on the
66:30 fence right they don't take any position
66:32 whatsoever
66:33 I would wager that an overwhelming
66:38 majority I would say I mean I'm just
66:40 pulling this out of my ass but over 70%
66:43 of the people who say they're on offense
66:45 they're worried about being wrong but
66:49 they do have a preference they may see a
66:51 bunch of lighter stuff in a minute you
66:52 know I kind of think this place might be
66:54 flat I mean I don't feel this movement
66:55 of you and they said he can't see
66:57 curvature in any plane on earth you
67:00 can't but people will tell you I saw a
67:02 curvature earlier like no you [ __ ]
67:04 didn't you have to be a team
67:06 to see curvature of the earth you do
67:08 you're wrong
67:09 no deGrasse Tyson did a presentation
67:11 with the blow-up globe and he said that
67:13 and it's probably the only things he
67:15 said that was accurate about the whole
67:16 movement could be the shape of the
67:18 windows in these planes that the bends
67:20 light and makes you think you're seeing
67:21 a curve maybe that's a scam that's being
67:23 pulled on the aviation staff and the
67:25 passengers of the planes who knows but
67:27 you don't see it we want to know how we
67:30 tick for those of you watch all my
67:32 episodes because you love the show and
67:34 you love these existential conversations
67:36 not that you agree with me at all but it
67:38 stimulates your own beliefs in whatever
67:40 the hell I'm talking about don't you
67:43 benefit from listening to me disagree
67:45 with you sometimes Oh guys you know I
67:48 love the guy but I mean he's totally
67:49 wrong with this thing but like watch
67:51 these other episodes they're not about
67:52 that subject you know it's a variety
67:54 show well in the end you went to bed at
67:56 night going ah I'm totally right about
67:59 this and maybe you are man I'm just a
68:03 guy trying to trying to do my best to
68:05 analyze information who would have ever
68:07 thought that the internet would be
68:10 responsible for bringing out such
68:13 incredible experiences such that we
68:16 could observe ourselves from afar but
68:20 also being the petri dish at the same
68:21 time I'm in the petri dish but I feel
68:24 like at times I can see the petri dish
68:26 from you know the what do they call it
68:28 the 30,000 foot view that's awesome for
68:32 me that's incredible I think that when
68:35 this all settles down the youth of the
68:38 world will not have that epiphany they
68:41 won't have the ability to see what we
68:43 saw so we're gonna be learning in this
68:45 generation everyone is paying attention
68:46 from 15 years old to 80 years old if
68:49 you're paying attention this slice of
68:52 the population is gonna learn a bunch
68:54 and then the next generation that comes
68:57 up it's not going to get it and then
68:59 we'll all have our own deep thoughts
69:00 radio trying to pass this information
69:03 back down you know we all have these
69:05 little fantasies in our brains of how
69:07 the world could be re-engineered I give
69:09 a glimpse into one of the fantasies I've
69:11 had for forever but definitely during
69:14 the course of this show which is that I
69:18 mentioned every once in a while but
69:20 the institution fantasy of having a
69:22 school of higher learning a school of
69:25 higher learning where we can all be
69:28 together and you know I mean if this
69:30 issue we had like a wing on the collar
69:33 you know wings of colleges have like the
69:34 drama wing the engineering wing the
69:36 mathematical wing all these other wings
69:38 we would have wings that it's like that
69:40 is the the shape of the planet wing and
69:45 there's a division in there for the flat
69:47 earth and there's a division in there of
69:48 the globe earth and these people don't
69:50 sit in their own worlds you know
69:53 quarantined from each other they do have
69:56 their researchers that go off and
69:59 research new ways of proving their
70:02 theory but when they come back into the
70:04 room it's just like the multiverse and
70:06 the single verse folks that wanted to
70:09 dispute how atoms and atomic matter is
70:12 held together in this you know was it
70:15 bigs
70:16 yeah the boson particle the god particle
70:19 I think a fantasy of mine would be able
70:22 to walk into a gigantic research room
70:24 that's just a war room it's all around
70:27 there and you know one side of the war
70:28 room is all flat and one side of the
70:30 world room is round and then we have
70:33 little annexes little corners where
70:35 someone thinks it's an inverted Saphir
70:37 or you know I forgot what the name of
70:39 that one model is where the earth is on
70:41 the inside of a sphere and but there's
70:44 all those other models and then we have
70:45 the matrix group that makes you excuse
70:47 like well we think we figured out
70:49 literally the fabric of the universe is
70:50 a binary memory system and so they have
70:53 tests and we bring it together and we
70:55 all dig each other and the only goal
70:58 that we have between all of us is to
71:00 figure out what the hell is going on
71:03 here and we're completely content with
71:06 being wrong because in the end as soon
71:10 as you find out you're wrong guess what
71:12 happens next you get to be right all
71:15 right you just go okay oh [ __ ] man I
71:18 thought I was a high five dude you
71:19 waiting poom I'll get the drinks tonight
71:22 you know now let's go down the path of
71:25 what we think is right since you proved
71:26 it was flat or you proved it was around
71:28 well let's investigate that more because
71:31 there's mysteries no matter what which
71:33 everyone wins obviously if globe wins
71:36 it's less of a mystery if the matrix
71:39 wins oh boy and get ready for the Jazz -
71:42 pour it on that world anyway I think you
71:45 feel me hopefully this was entertaining
71:48 for you it was very therapeutic for me
71:50 let me just tell you for those of you on
71:53 the Facebook page worried nuts it's an
71:56 organic thing you know and so we're
71:59 gonna make mistakes I guarantee you the
72:02 moderators on there are fantastic human
72:04 beings they care deeply about other
72:07 human beings at no point are they trying
72:10 to create a bias it just so happens they
72:12 have their own passionate beliefs so I
72:16 appreciate you guys for coming in and
72:18 voicing your opinions that are different
72:22 than everyone else's it's part of the
72:24 game it's part of the game we're playing
72:26 here but you know what we're all on the
72:28 same team we are all on the same team
72:31 just as a you know an exercise on a
72:34 daily basis maybe you have spent five
72:36 minutes thinking about the other team
72:37 being right now that would affect you
72:40 maybe maybe you start from a fresh slate
72:43 and go alright I've spent five years in
72:46 what I believe which is different than
72:47 those other folks let's go from scratch
72:49 and let's try to try to see if we can
72:51 believe the other side again maybe
72:52 something's in the middle by going
72:54 through that exercise and if you haven't
72:57 been already go to deep thoughts radio
72:58 Calm it's got all the feeds video audio
73:01 locked Facebook group patreon page a
73:04 Twitter page as a matter of fact so
73:07 until we meet again take care of
73:09 yourself and someone else over now
