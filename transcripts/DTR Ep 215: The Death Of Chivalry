00:33 gentlemen two deep thoughts on this
00:37 beautiful Saturday morning
00:39 it's about 78 degrees out today we're
00:44 going to talk about the death of
00:46 chivalry and I have to preface this and
00:51 it's gonna be very confusing to anyone
00:53 who doesn't get the beginning of this
00:55 especially females I'm willing to
01:00 believe and I'm willing to bet but the
01:04 females you are going to instantly watch
01:06 this are the kind that are going to
01:09 agree with this and the females that
01:14 would never watch this other females
01:15 that cause this in my opinion because in
01:19 very few cases do I take a bias male /
01:23 female female / male right I believe
01:28 that I have seen enough of this now that
01:30 I believe I've seen 35 years of this now
01:32 and I've sort of made up my mind as of
01:37 this moment as to what's happened with
01:40 shivery where it's gone and you know at
01:43 first I just felt it and I didn't know
01:46 how to put into words and then I kind of
01:48 got to the first stage of realizing what
01:49 was going on but I felt like I didn't
01:53 have all the information like I was
01:55 feeling something else it was a part of
01:57 the story and now I think just recently
02:00 in the last few months I think I have
02:02 completely I felt at least the full
02:04 circle of this so if you're a female
02:06 that's angry at me saying this stuff
02:08 then you're the one that's
02:11 at no point at fault for what I'm saying
02:16 if you're angry at this you're the ones
02:18 that need to teach the others I'd
02:21 appreciate it probably going ok what the
02:25 hell are you talking about get out with
02:26 the brother I come from the Midwest
02:30 where chivalry was not only taught but
02:37 really really demanded to be honest with
02:40 you that's just the way it was if you
02:43 didn't hold the door for someone you not
02:45 only got bitched out at the moment that
02:47 you didn't do it your family was
02:49 informed that you didn't do it right and
02:53 so we did it and when we were young it
02:56 was a part of like the invisible rite of
02:57 passage that exists in all modern
02:59 cultures right again if you new to the
03:02 show I always say that the modern world
03:04 has gotten rid of the rite of passage
03:06 whereas the more you know quote-unquote
03:10 primitive tribes have very specific
03:12 brighter passages now there are modern
03:15 writer passages like bar mitzvahs and
03:16 that sort of thing but shivery is big
03:23 and I think that the reason why I've
03:26 hesitated to say anything about it is
03:29 that there was this missing piece in my
03:31 brain so what is chivalry though what is
03:36 it really
03:38 it's just holding a door you know is it
03:43 pulling out a seat and pushing it behind
03:45 your your date is it everything about
03:47 courtship or does it something you would
03:51 do for your grandmother
03:52 and your mom and everyone else's wife
03:56 you know and their children chivalry to
04:01 me as I was taught taught is a code of
04:04 ethics and a code of conduct that a male
04:07 and uses to engage females of all walks
04:11 of life of all ages as a matter of fact
04:14 as a female becomes impaired due to age
04:20 the chivalry that the town would show
04:25 that woman rose because she no longer
04:28 has the fluent ability to move around
04:32 perhaps she loses the ability to drive
04:35 perhaps she walks a little slower
04:37 perhaps she's got weak body joints and
04:40 any point in time she could hit the
04:41 floor break a hip
04:44 perhaps she's hard of hearing what
04:48 perhaps her husband has passed as she's
04:51 alone all the time even though she puts
04:55 on a big smile when no one's I guess
05:00 what everyone's looking it's not their
05:03 most the time you know chivalry is a
05:08 beautiful communication protocol between
05:13 males and females it is extremely
05:15 important well you're really really
05:18 young you get taught to do things
05:20 because it's the way you should do them
05:23 and maybe as a little obedient boy you
05:26 love just doing what grown-ups do and so
05:28 you run to open the door first that sort
05:30 of thing
05:32 but as one gets older it is a calling
05:37 card to how you were raised
05:39 it's a calling card to your entire
05:41 family line your father your mother
05:44 the second that a gentleman shows up and
05:47 starts engaging in chivalry is to the
05:51 immediate degree that that whole family
05:53 line gets a big double thumbs up from
05:55 society because they know they raised
05:58 you properly
06:01 now obviously Hollywood is procure a
06:04 chivalry in all kinds of different
06:05 levels it's it's as simple as holding a
06:09 door to a salutation to the first and
06:15 final steps of courtship its defending
06:20 someone's honor but here's where I am
06:23 with this particular thing because I've
06:26 read that you know the t-shirt or
06:28 whatever it is it says chivalry is dead
06:32 and you know I heard that before I
06:34 really realized what was being said and
06:36 then finally I was like oh yeah this is
06:39 very interesting we've lost the code
06:41 that I grew up with and what's
06:44 interesting is if you're a female and
06:47 you weren't raised to expect chivalry
06:50 then you don't care that it's missing on
06:54 one level on your consciousness and your
06:58 consciousness level you don't miss it
07:02 but on the subconscious level you do
07:04 miss it even if you weren't taught
07:06 chivalry and that's what I believe and
07:08 that's the missing piece to the end of
07:10 the equation to discuss this which is I
07:13 believe the way that the chemical
07:15 structures are built inside of a female
07:19 everything that chivalry serves is
07:22 everything that is inside of the females
07:24 normal expectation and hopes and wishes
07:27 for her lover spouse co-parent of her
07:35 children to exert on her and you know
07:41 I'm not talking about high-maintenance
07:42 women who could never ever be satisfied
07:45 not talking about them I'm talking about
07:49 women who treat their men with their own
07:52 version of chivalry it's really
07:58 interesting I was raised in the Midwest
07:59 and there was two things that happened
08:01 to me before I left and one was that I
08:05 didn't realize that I was being raised
08:07 with people who had chivalry the
08:10 gentlemen that were you know my father's
08:13 age or at least my grandfather's age and
08:15 up definitely had chivalry V and the
08:22 second part that I've discovered was
08:24 that at some point I had met a woman
08:27 probably even a girl from high school I
08:30 think who had been trained by her mother
08:34 for what we call the southern belle
08:36 etiquette and if you don't know this
08:41 there is
08:43 a whole code of conduct that comes with
08:47 being a southern belle things you say
08:51 things you don't say how you hold your
08:53 hands how you stand up how you sit down
08:55 how you get up and the southern belle
08:58 was described to me in so many words and
09:00 I'm paraphrasing of course because they
09:02 never mentioned chivalry whatsoever but
09:06 it would seem like the southern belle
09:11 was being groomed to be prepared to
09:14 handle a gentleman who has been groomed
09:18 with chivalry she knew every point the
09:22 male should exert himself to engage in
09:27 chivalry she knew how to say thank you
09:30 she knew how to wait you know for things
09:32 to occur like don't walk through the
09:34 door don't grab the knob chill wait one
09:38 of us gentlemen will get it but to loop
09:41 back here on this final point I think
09:44 females almost genetically need to have
09:48 the connection with males that is
09:50 provided by chivalry I don't think it's
09:53 just this little thing where we can say
09:54 hey you know we used to do this we don't
09:57 do this anymore let's have a
09:59 conversation I think it's extremely
10:02 important that we try to bring some of
10:06 this back so what happened to chivalry
10:10 what happened to it well
10:17 beautiful practice was demonized it was
10:22 demonized that if a woman were to
10:23 receive any form of help that she was
10:27 there for a week and all I can say is
10:32 Wow
10:33 what a week stupid minded thing for us
10:36 to ever believe because I think both
10:39 sides of the fence believed it the
10:41 male's believed it what you can't open
10:43 your own door
10:45 you can't pull up the seat at the
10:47 restaurant you can't get your hair out
10:50 of your jacket you can't put your own
10:52 jacket on effortlessly I feel all these
10:55 things
10:56 oh you can't take a little insult at the
10:58 bar you're weak again I can't talk for
11:04 you know coastal ladies you know the
11:07 young man I did grow up in the in Boston
11:10 area for about almost just shy of three
11:12 years but the women I grew up with you
11:16 know were tough cookies and lived in you
11:19 know brutal environments brutal summers
11:21 brutal winters raised the children that
11:24 got jobs they didn't just sit at home
11:26 and to suggest that chivalry is keeping
11:31 the female down is the biggest crock of
11:35 [ __ ] I've ever heard of my life if
11:37 you've ever subscribed to that even
11:38 subliminally and I will say that I
11:41 probably had gone through that as a
11:43 young man too and saying why can't you
11:45 get your own door definitely not for an
11:49 older lady but maybe for someone my age
11:50 right there's a saying checks and
11:54 balances right one thing balances out
11:57 the other and checks and balances are
12:00 awesome when you get them in place
12:01 because then the world becomes an
12:03 automated world in that particular
12:05 category of what you're talking about
12:07 right because it just balances itself
12:09 out and it's hopefully something that is
12:11 by design you know some checks and
12:13 balances that are just synonymous with
12:17 existence chivalry was the difference
12:21 between your son growing up to be a man
12:23 I growing up to be a piece of [ __ ]
12:26 that's really what it's all about
12:32 figuring figuring out a way to
12:34 appreciate a female and again it's a
12:40 two-way street and this is what this
12:43 episode is about in my opinion I believe
12:46 there is more chivalry among men than
12:50 between men and women and just as a very
12:54 basic thing you know the men hold the
12:58 doors for each other and then we say the
13:00 special [ __ ] word which is thank you
13:04 we have salutations back and forth but I
13:10 can hold the door for a lady and I will
13:13 tell you right now maybe a third of the
13:15 time she'll say something that
13:18 acknowledges it even happened now we'll
13:21 say I live them on the coast in Southern
13:23 California so you have tons of
13:25 immigrants there are some races where
13:29 the females love it and you hold that
13:32 door and whether not they can speak
13:34 English very well they will give you the
13:36 jewels in their eyes and they will say
13:40 thank you and then you just feel like a
13:42 million bucks and there's other races
13:44 that come to this culture and the
13:45 females are just [ __ ] brutal robots
13:49 they have no emotion and it just seems
13:52 to be a dividing line between them it's
13:54 very interesting we all know that the
13:57 feminist movement really exploded in the
13:59 70s movies like 9 to 5 came out
14:04 Dolly Parton Lily Tomlin Annette - the
14:10 biggest problem with that in my opinion
14:12 just looking back is that women were
14:15 super heroes I mean they still are to
14:18 this day but back in those days they
14:19 were superheroes because they stayed at
14:22 home they got their education typically
14:24 stayed at home raise the children up to
14:25 the point where they're all in school
14:27 but it can be buttoned up in the morning
14:29 and hop on the bus and they're taken
14:32 care of until the parents come home at 5
14:33 o'clock sharp and then the women would
14:37 come home and take care of all the you
14:40 know domestic
14:42 domesticated chores of you know fixing
14:45 dinner and doing all this other stuff
14:48 they weren't expected to make the living
14:51 wage in the home they were only expected
14:54 to work if that was something they
14:55 wanted to do a lot of the ladies were
14:59 rewarded with staying home as a you got
15:04 the kids out of that first five years
15:06 another in school maybe go pick them up
15:08 at three o'clock and all that was
15:12 demonized the single income household
15:16 was demonized raising your children was
15:20 demonized right keeping your child out
15:25 of pop culture you know being there the
15:28 secretary kid scrapes their knee and mom
15:31 is the first one there not a [ __ ]
15:33 teacher not a nurse
15:34 the parent the flesh-and-blood the
15:38 moment of bonding was used up for
15:40 bonding and not for some alienation
15:43 reinforcing to your child that you're
15:45 really not there for them this is some
15:48 brutal [ __ ] thx 1-1 3-8 world you're
15:52 sold to the institution like an
15:54 experiment what was extra money that the
15:58 female went to work it now became
16:00 required money and you still can't make
16:03 ends meet because it's supposed to be a
16:05 two-income household right and what was
16:08 interesting was that I never saw any
16:10 direct attack on chivalry and any the
16:12 pop culture Hollywood themes that are
16:14 out there it just sort of got pushed out
16:18 of the way but I definitely saw
16:21 individual experiences where women would
16:23 look at men and say what you say and I
16:26 can't hold the door for myself I can't
16:28 open the door for myself I need your
16:29 help
16:30 I believe the chivalry is is Daei
16:34 and perhaps can be easily resurrected
16:38 because of a large margin of females
16:41 that have been influenced by feminists
16:44 to see any assistance whatsoever as a
16:48 declassification of humanism you're
16:54 subhuman if you need any help from
16:55 anyone
16:58 there's some of us men out here that
17:01 really miss women we miss you guys what
17:08 we have is a bunch of little girls
17:09 running around and some materialistic
17:11 cloud trying to convince everyone how
17:13 lady Gaga is actually really talented
17:15 man little girls who dress up in [ __ ]
17:21 outfits when they go on stage because
17:23 they can't grow up at least kids develop
17:27 some characters that they held on to for
17:29 50 years now again from judging from
17:35 responses and all the light
17:37 communication I have with the female
17:39 side of the viewers on the show I'm
17:41 preaching to the choir and I realized
17:43 that if you have children if you have a
17:48 young man young lady and your family
17:50 offspring directly of your own or your
17:53 brother's your sisters kids you know
17:57 maybe you you don't preach anyone else's
17:59 kids but you demonstrate it in front of
18:01 them but it's a two-way situation right
18:06 it's a setup
18:07 volleyball set up and it's a spike by
18:09 the woman right the man holds the door
18:11 the woman says thank you and a genuine
18:14 way that says I don't need your help
18:18 opening the door that's not the point
18:19 but the fact that you actually honored
18:23 me by leaping ahead and holding the door
18:25 and I do degree some doors are a
18:28 shit-ton harder to hold than others
18:31 there's something positive about it so
18:36 that's that again the fabric inside of a
18:38 female says I want to be loved and
18:40 appreciated by my family and especially
18:42 by my spouse especially by someone who
18:45 you know starts the process with me to
18:49 hold a child for nine months and then
18:51 you know as a female you have to hold it
18:54 for nine months ago through all their
18:55 aches and pains and birthing process
18:57 it's the least he can do
18:59 right and not just during pregnancy but
19:01 during your whole life to be honored
19:04 within your own home within your own
19:06 temple
19:08 if we don't have some structure of
19:11 give-and-take and chivalry in this world
19:15 then we become robots I mentioned the
19:19 two races that are very very different
19:21 at least in Southern California and I'm
19:25 just going to say one of the races has
19:27 religion built into their world they
19:31 have very intense Family Values built
19:34 into their world and even though the men
19:38 are sort of brutal sometimes because
19:40 they're very matriarchy there is
19:43 chivalry still and it's expected in
19:46 courtship goes a certain way and the
19:49 other race
19:51 I'm sure there's family values in there
19:54 but it is a brutal [ __ ] world that
19:56 they live in and it is just there's no
20:00 chivalry whatsoever I mean it I don't
20:02 think it has ever been a part of this
20:04 particular culture in the thousands of
20:06 years that they've existed and so the
20:10 females are dry the females are just I
20:14 think unhappy every time I see them if
20:16 they're fresh off the boat consequently
20:19 the other females in the other race it's
20:23 almost like they're always happy it's
20:26 bizarre but I guess I like guarantee you
20:30 chivalry turns one of them on and
20:32 chivalry doesn't do [ __ ] to the other
20:33 one and in America which is a huge
20:37 melting pot it's sort of a in my opinion
20:43 it's a lose twice succeed once formula
20:47 two out of three don't know you're there
20:50 they don't know you exist but again I
20:54 believe that the female architecture the
20:57 female body and mind and soul it's more
21:02 than just a one I think it's a need I
21:04 think women need chivalry around them I
21:07 think they need to understand that they
21:08 are protected you know there's a
21:11 vulnerability that everyone is born with
21:14 I think that you have to overcome
21:16 somehow and I think that when you're a
21:21 male you
21:22 go lift your weights eat well get all
21:24 buffed up and learn how to shoot a gun
21:25 or whatever this fight and you can kind
21:28 of get some some plateau that is good
21:31 enough to live every day with because
21:33 [ __ ] doesn't happen that's the nice
21:35 thing about it we don't get in gunfights
21:37 anymore and that kind of stuff
21:39 but you just have a little bit in your
21:41 quiver just in case [ __ ] goes down but
21:44 for a female it depends on what kind of
21:47 female you are again there's a lot of
21:49 very tough tough females out there for
21:52 sure but you don't want to go down that
21:54 path you don't want to go to the gym and
21:55 get tough so at some point you have to
21:58 say look my job is being soft and being
22:01 cerebral and being emotional my job is
22:04 to take care of the children your job is
22:08 to put a shelter over our head and
22:09 protect the shelter and that's a you
22:12 know very primitive way of saying it but
22:16 that's sort of where the emphasis is
22:18 right I'll get Mel make money - don't
22:19 worry about it but you're supposed to
22:21 make the most money you just are I'm
22:23 saddled with making sure that our
22:24 offspring come out the way that we both
22:26 agreed they should I want our sons to
22:30 turn out like you and when our daughters
22:31 have turned out like me and you should
22:33 be doing the same on your end right and
22:35 think about it before we talk about
22:39 having sons think about having daughters
22:41 a lot of parents start freaking out once
22:44 their daughters start dating because at
22:45 least in America the game is you're
22:48 never to be single again once you have
22:50 your first date it's the most pathetic
22:53 [ __ ] reality that America has ever
22:55 created and no one seems to [ __ ]
22:57 notice right your kid dates at 13 or
22:59 whatever some little high school when
23:02 you go out with anything and [ __ ] man
23:04 they are never by themselves until the
23:07 day they say I do and then they've
23:09 totally missed out on who they could
23:10 have been in reality because they never
23:12 listened to themselves once right men
23:14 only wish they had this capability trust
23:16 me but you know that moment when you
23:20 worry about your daughter picking the
23:22 wrong kid a bad influence
23:26 either he's a bad influence because the
23:28 kids are [ __ ] and you know your
23:30 daughter will never be protected or he's
23:32 totally a drunk maniac and you're just
23:34 waiting for our
23:36 - violent situation to determine whether
23:38 or not your daughter's dead or whether
23:40 or not she'll have to live through a
23:42 beatings I will tell you the secret to
23:47 make sure your family doesn't have that
23:48 problem you teach your children about
23:51 chivalry mom and dad have to engage in
23:54 chivalry right before the children there
23:56 is a process it is not on point and that
24:00 it's like son you CLI held the daughter
24:02 you know door for your mother
24:03 no it's just done it's done around and
24:06 there's an appreciation moment and
24:08 there's a sacrifice to get it done and
24:11 the funny thing is is that the the
24:15 husband feels wonderful making the
24:17 sacrifice and the wife feels great that
24:20 it was actually made when your daughter
24:23 wakes up every single day and sees that
24:25 kind of stuff or start to finish and
24:28 especially beyond the basic
24:32 interpretation of holding the door I'm
24:34 going to use that one a lot because this
24:35 is the most basic thing you could
24:36 possibly do and this is going to be
24:39 easier said than done and I've certainly
24:41 failed I succeeded and failed during
24:44 this next example but the big one I
24:46 think is huge is when the mommy and
24:50 daddy aren't agreeing on something and
24:52 they're not agreeing on something really
24:54 big and you manage to cordially work it
25:00 out or find a way to work it out in a
25:03 different place in a different time and
25:05 in between that resolution moment and
25:10 the moment that it occurred there's a
25:13 love that could still exist I mean I
25:16 don't have a child living in my house
25:18 anymore but you know I would love to
25:20 have a situation in my lifetime where
25:22 there's a kid in the house this happens
25:24 and as mommy and daddy situation were
25:28 we're agreeing that we're going to
25:31 resolve that we're going to bring this
25:32 issue back up we're going to take it
25:33 down now bring it back up at a later
25:35 point yeah three or four hours later
25:38 tomorrow but immediately we pretend as
25:42 if it didn't exist and we go back to
25:44 loving each other you know visually sit
25:46 on my lap watch TV kids over here on the
25:48 sofa
25:49 he gets to see it and goes wow they just
25:51 totally disagreed but they were able to
25:52 put that aside schedule a resolution
25:55 future in the future and then just love
25:58 each other in the meantime because you
25:59 know what would happen you'd never bring
26:02 it up again you just go [ __ ] we just had
26:06 a little tiff my chemicals went this way
26:09 yours went that way and boom we had a
26:10 disagreement
26:11 how is a Sharia law able to move into
26:16 Europe where you know eighty year old
26:20 men are bringing their thirteen-year-old
26:22 daughters where you know it takes two
26:26 females to make the opinion of one male
26:28 if you're lucky
26:30 female circumcision is still practiced
26:33 assassinating your wife is actually
26:35 completely copacetic as long as you
26:37 decided it was something that needed to
26:39 happen how is all that possible to blend
26:44 in with a first world country this is in
26:46 third world Sharia law is [ __ ] you
26:49 know tenth world it's 2,000 to 3,000
26:52 year old belief systems that are being
26:53 indoctrinated into first world people so
26:57 they can feel better about themselves
26:58 right it's able to exist next to
27:02 civilize people because we have let go I
27:05 think of chivalry at a minimum what's
27:10 interesting for me is when you go back
27:11 and you watch a movie made the 1940s or
27:14 the 1930s and you watch the etiquette
27:16 that is in every single scene of every
27:18 film and it could be a super-duper
27:21 nightclub where you would expect
27:23 everyone to be dapper and grabbing hands
27:25 and kissing the top and knuckles and all
27:27 that kind of stuff but it goes all the
27:28 way down to a gangster there's still
27:32 shivery chivalry right in front of your
27:34 face and all these different scenarios I
27:37 talked about a lot we we have to make
27:40 evil stick out like a sore thumb I say
27:43 it all the time right
27:44 what does that mean well we have to have
27:47 a standard in this world such that any
27:49 behavior that's against that standard
27:51 sticks out like a sore thumb
27:53 well we've allowed our morality to be
27:56 absolutely corrupted
28:01 starts off as a little seed and then it
28:03 grows in a particular direction it's
28:05 never checked we pat ourselves on the
28:07 back of look look at what we'd done we
28:10 planted the Beanstalk of pornography the
28:15 Beanstalk of you know gangster-rap where
28:18 it turns into every woman's a [ __ ] and
28:21 the sad thing about that little gangster
28:23 rap thing if you really be wanting to
28:25 like 1989 when that was starting to come
28:28 out NWA was making songs about women
28:30 women be in [ __ ] it stemmed from a
28:33 very real thing where chivalry had died
28:36 in the ghetto and the females you know
28:39 the mills were being yanked one way and
28:41 the females were being yanked the other
28:42 way but the females of the ghetto were
28:43 being yanked completely away from any
28:45 chivalry any self-respect and everything
28:48 became a game of I'm gonna get what I
28:52 want
28:53 which is completely pop cultured in my
28:56 mind it's all horse [ __ ] that I don't
28:57 need and so men were getting treated
29:00 poorly in the ghetto you know a guy
29:03 would be used up for all this money in
29:04 the chick would drop it and that's where
29:06 they got this whole designation that the
29:08 women were [ __ ] in their area right
29:11 in America we treat our children with
29:15 the utmost delicacy and respect and
29:20 there should be that you know that part
29:23 of chivalry that goes up into adulthood
29:27 again the southern belle part of the
29:29 training which I didn't quite finish up
29:31 on was to teach a female everything that
29:34 she is going to do and again a southern
29:36 belle stuff is very antiquated of course
29:37 when you have to sit a particular way my
29:41 friend's first statement was when she
29:42 was going through her Southern Belle
29:44 training was you know you know women sit
29:47 on their vaginas not on their asses
29:49 which means you sit really straight up
29:51 you know
29:53 I'm not sure we're trying to go to that
29:55 level but we have to have an apparatus
29:58 where the women know which evilly is and
30:01 either could teach their sons or they
30:04 can teach their you know bumbling
30:06 boyfriends husbands this is sort of what
30:08 I'd like to start doing and I'll be very
30:11 appreciative of it the entire time
30:13 right and the men have to get trained as
30:17 to what the hell to do if Europe still
30:21 had any chivalry whatsoever then a group
30:25 of people moving in with their
30:27 quote/unquote religious culture to
30:30 essentially objectify women and female
30:33 children little girls it would be
30:37 unacceptable and when Merkel the
30:41 Communist exciting on earth when she
30:45 tells you to look the other way and
30:46 you're a police officer in Germany
30:48 instead of letting your Prussian
30:51 education you know obey the state no
30:53 matter [ __ ] what happens you would
30:56 tell her to go [ __ ] herself and any CEO
30:59 that tells you do such a thing you would
31:01 tell him to go [ __ ] himself too and all
31:05 you'd have to do is point the guy go
31:06 this guy just told me to look the other
31:07 way as a 13 year old girls being raped
31:09 by an 80 year old guy under the guise of
31:12 religious freedom this is not about
31:15 Sharia law but I thought I'd throw that
31:17 example in there you want to know how
31:19 the world's getting corroded slowly
31:21 there's is one area where chivalry could
31:24 snap that [ __ ] out of existence what I
31:28 think is amazing is that we by this line
31:31 of horseshit it is just a complete line
31:33 of horseshit that somehow if we're in a
31:35 war somewhere in the Middle East we're
31:37 bringing them democracy most adults
31:40 understand that that's a complete
31:42 horseshit but then again we don't fight
31:43 against the wars when that line of
31:44 horseshit is the rationale for war we're
31:46 going over there but define democracy
31:50 democracy is you know a way of freedom
31:52 to bring the ten Bill of Rights from the
31:54 Constitution United States over to all
31:56 these Middle Eastern countries well
31:58 great but we don't give a [ __ ] about
32:01 basic human rights when that [ __ ] moves
32:04 into Europe supposedly and
32:05 I was trying to move into the United
32:08 States I'd love to see a Renaissance 2.0
32:11 of chivalry sure we can adjust it a
32:17 little bit that just depends but I think
32:19 some of the basics that have been around
32:20 for ages and ages are just fantastic the
32:25 chivalry is not your husband giving you
32:28 you know a 10 carat diamond it's not
32:31 it's not him giving you a Mercedes it's
32:34 not that at all
32:36 it's a fabric that exists all day long
32:39 that'll let you know that he appreciates
32:41 your existence that if he can he'll take
32:45 a little bit of burden off your back you
32:48 know I'm sure a lot of you like me your
32:50 kids are raised in school and in their
32:53 own lives and so there may be this idea
32:56 well you know the kids are all done
32:59 chivalry can be turned off a little bit
33:01 now because hey we're not puppies
33:04 anymore in this kennel I'm going to tell
33:08 you that's bad idea what happens in
33:11 America when a couple gets married how
33:16 many times have you experienced this you
33:20 get married and you take a bunch of
33:21 photographs and then you have all your
33:23 kids and 20 30 years later you're
33:27 looking at your facebook profiles both
33:28 you and your husband or your husband you
33:30 and your wife and you're so obese in
33:34 your current photos that you keep
33:36 posting the photos of your wedding or
33:38 when you were young 15 20 years ago
33:40 because it's the last time you could see
33:43 your feet it didn't used to be this way
33:47 when I grew up in the 70s in the Midwest
33:50 where we ate like [ __ ] pigs every
33:54 single day the town was not obese the
33:58 couple people that were obese were known
34:00 by name and they were sort of this
34:02 oddity you know but now what's the game
34:06 the game is as soon as you get married
34:07 you get to give up on yourself
34:10 yippity-do da right you don't have to
34:12 eat well anymore in this country getting
34:16 pregnant means you have a reason to be
34:19 OB
34:19 for the rest of your life and you can
34:20 always blame it on bear and children
34:22 right you know I have four aunts that
34:26 crank out probably ten kids 15 kids
34:29 amongst the four of them none of them
34:35 none of them have ever been obese in
34:37 will ever be obese in fact three of them
34:39 taught aerobics while pregnant and all
34:43 of them married men who maintain
34:46 chivalry day to day it's the coolest
34:48 thing about my uncles that I'm not you
34:50 know blood related to I watched women
34:53 that raised me as a kid that I love
34:54 dearly they're all sort of like pseudo
34:56 moms to me and they're all taken care of
34:59 by great men who provide and they're
35:05 appreciative if you give up on yourself
35:08 due to any rationale you will interrupt
35:12 the fabric of chivalry you just will
35:15 there's an old saying no country for old
35:18 men is a movie with that name and a book
35:21 before that you know and for those of
35:25 you are not familiar with the phrase it
35:26 just means as you get older the
35:27 standards of the world change and you
35:29 find yourself extremely alienated with
35:31 where culture is today and it happens to
35:33 every single generation on a certain
35:35 level of metric right when rock-and-roll
35:38 music came out in the 50s and really
35:40 boomed you know you had a previous
35:43 generation horrified that we were going
35:45 to lose control of society and we did we
35:47 did lose control of society now some
35:49 great things happen as a result of that
35:51 music getting out there and we learned
35:53 more about ourselves because again in
35:56 the 50s from everything I can gather
35:58 doing interviews with you know my own
36:01 family members we had tightened down the
36:03 hatches of how to behave without really
36:06 communicating the rationale for why
36:08 we're behaving that way which I've
36:09 talked about other episodes where and
36:12 that leads to the thing that I hated as
36:14 a child which was someone would say do
36:15 this behave this way and I would simply
36:17 ask the question why because it was
36:20 confusing to me I wanted to do something
36:22 different they wanted me not to do it
36:24 and then you know I had a parent that
36:27 would say because I'm your parent I'm
36:30 telling you to do it this way
36:31 and that was a super [ __ ] lazy that
36:34 what they need to do and it was just
36:35 based on the naivety of my parent he was
36:38 saying that he didn't I guess have the
36:40 ability articulate very well and it just
36:42 made me double down on not doing it and
36:45 then when I became a parent it was
36:47 extremely easy to describe why I wanted
36:52 my childhood is something slightly
36:53 different that she wanted to do and I
36:56 think most of the nine out of ten she'd
37:00 follow the rules probably even more nut
37:04 but if you're a male and you'd like to
37:08 reintroduce chivalry to your female I
37:11 would suggest you know you can try it
37:14 two different ways right you can just
37:15 turn it on and see what she does you
37:19 might be really surprised you know when
37:22 you hold the door for a woman you know
37:23 you're walking out to the car to either
37:25 put her in the car to picking her up
37:28 from some location where she lives to
37:30 taking Eric to dinner and then getting
37:31 the door you know either you'll use
37:34 sometimes valleys will do it for you
37:35 obviously but no one does anyone feel
37:37 shitty when a valet opens both doors no
37:40 it's awesome right it's kind of weird
37:43 because you know you don't want to
37:44 create out you know groveling class
37:46 structure you know or you're the
37:47 chauffeur on the driver but if you can
37:51 if you can start doing it and just pay
37:54 attention you might see it organically
37:55 grow within your relationship and you'll
37:57 immediately see other things happen in
38:00 your relationship that you've never seen
38:02 before because she is remembering that
38:05 respect and so you never know you go
38:09 inside the house and she does something
38:12 simple it blows your mind or you go into
38:15 the bedroom and something amazing
38:16 happens because she's like I'm with the
38:18 right guy who treats me well you know
38:22 females really and again pardon me
38:25 females for having to listen to this guy
38:27 talk on the other side of the fence here
38:29 but correct me if I'm wrong you want a
38:32 gentleman that can provide for you
38:34 financially you understand it's a dual
38:37 income household nowadays and so you do
38:39 know it's it's a crapshoot to ever find
38:41 anyone that can pay all the bills but
38:44 just depends on where you live right but
38:47 you want the guy to protect you at night
38:48 when noises happen if something crazy
38:51 happens in society you just kind of take
38:53 a deep breath and you go I'm pretty sure
38:55 I can hold my own - but it's nice to
38:57 have a big strong man in the house you
38:59 didn't have to be tall it has to be 300
39:02 pounds of muscle he just has to have the
39:04 heart and the soul to do it but the last
39:08 thing that I always think the females
39:09 that I have met I've really obsessed on
39:12 is finding a father for their children
39:18 there's few things more coveted than
39:20 that females will be interestingly sort
39:24 of irrational sometimes and they'll go
39:27 and have sex with a guy that seems like
39:29 he'll be the best gene pool and go off
39:31 to another guy to do the raising of the
39:33 child that's how unbelievably dedicated
39:37 female can be to creating the best child
39:39 on planet earth which is her gene pool
39:41 right shivery is the mechanism of the
39:45 past to allow a female to see what's
39:48 inside you how selfless are you how much
39:52 do you respect me you really love me you
39:57 know guys if you if you want to you know
40:00 say we'll see those little over see
40:01 those little I'll do that [ __ ] anymore
40:03 man I'm [ __ ] so tired at the end of
40:05 the day mmm all right well how many
40:10 decades you think that shit's going to
40:11 go on before she's just going to go and
40:12 use I'm [ __ ] tired too dude and
40:16 obviously there are exceptions to this
40:18 example there are people that abuse the
40:21 system and there's nothing you can do to
40:22 really turn them around before you die
40:25 so you're going to have to apply this
40:27 you know pro-rated Lee apply this to
40:31 your life but in 2017 I don't see any
40:37 any lack of men that are willing to hold
40:39 the door but I definitely see a huge
40:42 lack of females that are willing to
40:44 [ __ ] acknowledge that ever happened I
40:46 don't know some of your listeners you're
40:48 like [ __ ] you man I always do it and it
40:50 never happens to me I always have to
40:52 hold the door for myself guys slam doors
40:53 in my face on behalf of all males I
40:56 apologize for those
40:58 manchild that man children that you keep
41:01 upping into I dated a woman a few years
41:04 back and something very interesting
41:06 happened I'm huge in the show very I
41:10 love it and something happened where I
41:15 think I had held the door you know I
41:16 popped the doors open and you know her
41:18 daughter went in there and she went in
41:20 the front and closed everything I popped
41:22 around got in the car and as soon as I
41:24 got in the car she said she turned
41:26 around to her daughter and she said you
41:28 know did you see what just happened
41:30 there
41:31 the way that he held the doors for us
41:33 well girl says yes and she says when you
41:37 find a man that you want to marry she
41:41 said make sure he does that for you and
41:44 she would stress this over and over and
41:46 she would it was crazy about it she
41:48 caught me off guard every single time
41:50 and it was interesting I would say you
41:52 know I wouldn't be able to predict what
41:54 behavior I came up with which would make
41:56 her tell her daughter this and the funny
42:00 thing was is that I felt like a million
42:02 bucks a billion bucks every single time
42:04 that happened because I thought wow you
42:06 know this is a this is an heirloom of
42:09 behavior from the Midwest that barely
42:11 exists in California but I found a woman
42:14 who appreciates it so much that she's
42:18 going to tell her daughter that this is
42:19 a standard that she needs to apply to
42:21 herself you know I think one of the
42:24 things we can do to sort of kind of
42:27 bring it back it's just to bring up the
42:30 conversation you know if you're a female
42:33 bring it up with all your female friends
42:34 and say you know I was thinking about
42:36 this young to worry about son about this
42:38 she'll just say you know thinking about
42:40 this and do you like it when a guy hold
42:43 the door or when a guy does this or that
42:45 or this or you know bites his lip when
42:48 he wants to go crazy and if you can get
42:51 them to agree yeah maybe we can put it
42:54 together and say let's let's try to
42:57 bring that back
42:59 you know if you have influence over a
43:02 male that is not exactly your husband so
43:04 he doesn't feel attacked
43:06 maybe it's your son maybe it's just a
43:08 male acquaintance just bring up the
43:10 conversation about how you do realize
43:14 that in my opinion again it's the female
43:17 emotions that are utterly prepared and
43:21 nurtured by chivalry right you have
43:25 sensors inside your soul that are
43:28 waiting for these moments of chivalry to
43:30 occur and then you have that dopamine
43:33 the dumps in your mind that says oh my
43:35 god this is fantastic I love this and
43:39 the thing is if chivalry never happens
43:42 you have sort of a wasted sensor in your
43:45 heart and I just want to say this is
43:49 what makes this show cool for me
43:50 personally is that I'll walk around life
43:52 and I'll see these things like chivalry
43:55 missing from society and I'll I'll just
43:57 you know go a few minutes where I'm a
44:00 little frustrated and this is where I
44:04 get to kind of spew it to the universe
44:06 and hopefully get some feedback going
44:08 here you know the doozy as a male is if
44:13 you and ever if you ever have a moment
44:15 and it happens like once Automator every
44:17 hundred times where you had the chance
44:20 to hold the door and you didn't and then
44:23 you notice that the female looks at you
44:25 like you could have held the door
44:28 [ __ ] you know and you're like oh god
44:31 you know totally was going to do that
44:33 and I'm so used to females not saying
44:35 thank you and not expecting it that I
44:38 gave up on you but you were the one
44:41 female that was waiting for it that
44:43 would have made my day had I got out of
44:44 my got off my lazy ass and held the door
44:49 and I'll just put a footnote in one of
44:52 the reasons why in the coastal regions
44:54 so we run into this basic thing a lot as
44:57 one we you know we obviously have a
44:59 pretty dense population here out here
45:00 but we're always eating out we're always
45:03 you know having to go into department
45:05 stores for everything that we have in
45:06 this world and so there's all these
45:08 opportunities all the time
45:10 meeting new people again holding doors
45:13 is just something I say all the time in
45:15 this episode because it's just so easy
45:17 and what a beautiful little litmus test
45:19 it is to take a kind of a temperature on
45:21 where chivalry is within romantic
45:25 relationships there's just you know
45:28 dozens and dozens of opportunities to to
45:32 show your respect right and yes
45:36 gentlemen there's those awkward times
45:37 when the the woman's like 30 40 feet out
45:40 there and you're you you want to do it
45:42 you have it in your blood today and you
45:44 know if you hold that door you're going
45:46 to seem like a creeper because you're
45:47 hold you hard for like you know 30
45:48 seconds going down waiting for you and
45:50 she's like that's a little weird it's
45:54 strange how that works right so let's go
45:59 into a couple of the other things and
46:00 then shut this episode down one of the
46:04 things my father did was he allowed all
46:06 of us boys at the house to say whatever
46:08 we wanted to we could cut up a storm we
46:11 could say the most inappropriate things
46:13 you could possibly imagine but if there
46:16 was a female and earshot you were not
46:19 allowed to do that and every once in
46:22 while I'd slip because the funny thing
46:24 was is that I had bought into this idea
46:27 that when I was alone with my girlfriend
46:29 I could say those things and you know
46:30 she'd say some form of her version of it
46:33 which was obviously more respectful than
46:35 the way I would do it but so I go home
46:37 with my dad my girlfriend would be there
46:39 and I'd slip and say something that I
46:41 would say to her by herself and he jump
46:44 up my ass maybe like you know he goes
46:47 say here you know he'd say you know
46:49 we're not talking like that around
46:50 females and it was one of the
46:53 disciplinary things my father did that
46:55 even though a little shocking every time
46:58 it happened I was like he's right he's
47:01 right and in the funny thing was as a
47:03 son of my father
47:04 it made me honor him but I'm sitting
47:08 there going wow when we're alone
47:09 there's sailor talk and then as soon as
47:13 my father's around a female he has a
47:16 behavior and it doesn't mean this way it
47:18 does it did not matter if he respected
47:21 that female or didn't respect that
47:22 female
47:23 liked her or didn't like her there was a
47:25 code of behavior that simply went along
47:27 with being in front of females you know
47:30 regardless if we want to admit it we
47:31 judge people's characters very quickly
47:33 right and we try to use every piece of
47:37 interaction with a person to determine
47:40 what kind of person they are so you know
47:43 when you go up to a female and her and
47:46 swearing in the show yeah I understand
47:47 I'm not trying to date anyone on the
47:49 audience right and you're using a bunch
47:52 of foul language and the more you can
47:54 textually use the foul language it just
47:56 starts to make you look like a loose
48:00 hinge you know most people have them
48:04 been in the fistfight in their lifetime
48:06 and if you do and it's it's there's two
48:09 types of confrontations you could get
48:11 into you're the jerk and they're
48:12 defending someone's honor of their own
48:14 or someone else's or you're you're the
48:18 one that's honorable and someone's just
48:19 looking for a fight and so when you're
48:23 in the second half of that you're you're
48:26 trying to if you're in a public place
48:27 you start talking to random strangers
48:29 that may be a little intoxicated here
48:31 and there at some concert or you're at
48:33 some bar or restaurant or whatever
48:35 public picnic and a second that someone
48:39 starts using certain words and exudes a
48:42 certain you know insecurity of machoism
48:44 you realize well I'm going to finish
48:47 this conversation and I'm going to go
48:49 talk to people a little more in control
48:51 of themselves right
48:52 typically it's usually either someone
48:55 who's unhappily married or someone who's
48:58 single who's pulling off the latter
49:00 formula there and you'll find that going
49:03 and hanging out with the dudes that have
49:04 been married for 10 years it's just a
49:06 safe zone you're with rational human
49:08 beings and no one's run in their mouth
49:10 and you don't worry about anything right
49:11 so I'll let you choose which world you
49:15 want to live in do you want to live in a
49:17 world with chivalry or not you want to
49:20 have a nice beautiful fabric that gives
49:23 you the opportunity to meet people of
49:25 the opposite sex because you have this
49:27 honor among civilization I'm willing to
49:34 bet that the answer is unequivocally yes
49:36 for all of you
49:37 don't let anyone tell you that someone
49:39 being nice to you makes you weak ladies
49:44 it's the worst thing about feminism in
49:47 my opinion notice that as feminism
49:52 begins to grow and continues to grow in
49:55 this world you start getting more butchy
49:58 women the orientations sway because if
50:05 your goal inside your brain is to be a
50:07 dude what could you possibly do sexually
50:10 for your orientation you're going to be
50:13 a dude eventually you know when I was in
50:16 the Bay Area there was there's just an
50:18 amazing disproportional amount of
50:20 homosexuality up there and you know even
50:23 though I got no problem with you know
50:26 where you end up in life it was
50:28 fascinating to me and again I've talked
50:30 about my buddy who was got his PhD in
50:32 microbiology and he went searching for
50:34 the gene that he believed was
50:38 responsible for homosexuality because he
50:40 in his later life he he thought he was
50:44 you know gay and I asked him I said well
50:48 did you find it and he just shrugged his
50:50 head he's no because I think it's social
50:52 because believe me I've been done every
50:55 single theory out there you know
50:57 whatever happens happens pretty early
50:58 for some folks so you know again I don't
51:00 know if you can rehabilitate people you
51:02 know I kind of suffer if you should even
51:04 try
51:04 I'm not weighing in on that at all but I
51:07 would interview friends about their
51:10 upbringing and it was a I've said this
51:16 on one other show and I'm mentioning
51:18 this because I think it does incorporate
51:20 itself into the fabric of society when
51:22 it comes to chivalry and when it comes
51:24 to this perception of weakness when
51:26 being assisted honorably by another
51:28 human being the other real interesting
51:32 one that I discovered was that the kids
51:36 that I had met that were really lost
51:38 sexually and I mean lost because you
51:41 know when you when you really start
51:42 engaging folks that are dealing with
51:43 this realization that their body and
51:46 their mind are kind of in contrast with
51:48 each other sexually
51:50 you know I've had friends of mine who
51:52 were realizing that they were gay sit
51:54 down with me and talk about the struggle
51:56 talk about the pain and you know many of
51:58 my friends have said I wouldn't wish
51:59 this on anyone which I thought you know
52:02 they're obviously they adapt and they
52:03 lose that sense of alienation I think
52:07 they tend to give me the feeling that
52:10 they don't completely lose that way that
52:12 layer of alienation but how could you
52:13 you know you're in a world that's it's
52:15 different it's more biologically driven
52:19 but one thing that I've noticed is that
52:22 the people even my straight friends they
52:26 they had parents that didn't talk to
52:29 them they had parents that never said I
52:32 love you parents that never hugged them
52:34 and obviously there's plenty people who
52:37 survived the biological orientation with
52:40 parents like this but I had parents that
52:43 were very engaging if it weren't my if
52:46 it wasn't my parents be engaging with my
52:48 grandparents being great examples of how
52:51 to live life and chivalry was all over
52:53 the place
52:54 when I was a kid but there's a reason
52:57 why we raise our children the reason why
53:00 we raise our children is because they
53:02 don't know what to do with life you know
53:06 animals do it animals show their young
53:09 how to do things how to hunt how to
53:12 build a nest how to do all kinds of
53:15 stuff yes there's a lot of genetic
53:17 programming that passes down for brain
53:18 to brain but most offspring hang out
53:23 with their parents not all little
53:25 turtles do not have their parents they
53:28 just crawl into the ocean and it's free
53:30 game but that's why I lot of them get
53:31 eaten up chivalry is an amazing
53:34 balancing checks and balance I think
53:39 whatever you end up being just be a good
53:42 person then all all things the knife
53:45 will be good you know if you're
53:48 surrounded by people that don't
53:49 appreciate you and what you do for
53:51 society can move I don't give a [ __ ] if
53:54 it is your hometown find people that are
53:59 like you and you will have a wonderful
54:00 life you know
54:02 find people that have had the same
54:04 struggle you've had and you'll have a
54:05 wonderful life why do you think mining
54:07 communities you know stick together
54:09 because they are suffering the slings
54:11 and arrows of life that no when he
54:14 crawls into a mind would a known who
54:16 hasn't called into a mind would
54:19 understand right so I know you feel me
54:23 again apologies in the females feel like
54:26 you don't you know have any problem
54:29 appreciating chivalry if anything you're
54:30 the cheerleaders you are the ones I
54:32 don't think that's weak
54:33 you're the evangelists it's never too
54:38 late to turn it back on
54:39 the fact it could be the most endearing
54:41 thing you can do so you've been married
54:44 for forty years thirty years whatever
54:46 and you sort of let it fade away and
54:48 you're you always looking for something
54:49 new to spice up the relationship there
54:52 you go turning that stuff back on and
54:54 enjoy yourself you've made this far
54:57 thanks for listening as always deep
