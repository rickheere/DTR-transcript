00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies
00:34 gentlemen today is gonna be a rather
00:38 esoteric biological episode that is
00:41 going to be me freestyling where I
00:46 should probably write it all down and
00:47 then tell you afterwards but this came
00:53 to me sort of as a for me it was sort of
00:58 a super epiphany and it has to do with
01:03 the symmetry of life and the fact that
01:11 now there's a potential it's going to
01:13 rain sooner than the weather report says
01:16 so let's keep our kidneys crossed here
01:18 and get through an episode so you know
01:23 that all of my episodes pretty much from
01:27 the very beginning four years ago talked
01:31 about this stuff called ether and again
01:36 we're talking about the masterminds of
01:37 the universe teaching us about this
01:41 stuff having tracked it the thing is
01:45 after you've been studying as long as I
01:46 have you know the unified theories that
01:51 have been suggested by the theoretical
01:53 universe you develop these sort of
01:58 instincts for how mass and energy behave
02:02 how they translate between each other
02:03 from a solid state to a more energy
02:08 dynamic fluid state you start to hear
02:11 that you know that little wing of
02:14 physics where they talk to you about
02:20 light light behaving like a particle
02:23 light behaving like a wave and you
02:26 suddenly realize that when everything is
02:28 made out of the same thing we're talking
02:30 about verbs and nouns that
02:34 transformation from one state to another
02:36 as perceived by the optics that you have
02:38 to proceed
02:40 now we don't necessarily see light but
02:43 you could I mean sorry we don't
02:44 necessarily hear light but you could
02:46 hear light if you were built differently
02:48 if the way that the brain interprets the
02:50 visual cortex were to be routed to an
02:52 auditory Allah imagine that you know be
02:54 like those movies where they play that
02:57 desert scene i subdued wakes up in the
03:00 desert and hear that sizzling you know
03:02 violin thing we could have that but we
03:05 don't what has always fascinated me is
03:09 the symmetry of life and there's quite a
03:10 few takes on this but I'm unaware of
03:15 anyone doing an ether old particle take
03:17 on it because if you really study the
03:24 assertions of ether Tesla says ether and
03:28 water behave exactly the same and what's
03:31 kind of funny as I read that after I had
03:33 suggested it in my article but it's sort
03:37 of a our my episode but it's sort of you
03:40 know so obvious but that dude was
03:43 tracking it at a much more meticulous
03:46 level with machines whereas were just
03:48 using observable reality right why is
03:52 the body in some cases especially let's
03:55 just use human bodies why are we
03:57 incredibly symmetrical we're not
04:01 perfectly symmetrical down to the atom
04:03 but we are fairly symmetrical beings and
04:06 then when you go inside the gut can a
04:08 hell of a human being you start to get
04:12 asymmetry and it's a very interesting
04:16 thing but even in something that is
04:19 asymmetrical in the human body you could
04:22 take it out of the body and turn it in a
04:25 particular way like this cigar and it's
04:28 going to be a mirror image and a lot of
04:31 cases the pancreas the liver there's
04:35 been an adjustment for gravity so let's
04:39 go through this that which forms first I
04:45 believe suffers from the most
04:47 symmetrical design that which forms
04:51 later
04:52 tends to get a less symmetrical design
04:55 what do I mean by that well now imagine
04:59 we're teeny-tiny cells forming obviously
05:02 the heartbeat comes on really quickly
05:04 which is where the soul attaches to the
05:07 mass I think it perhaps attaches when
05:11 the brainstem and the heart are very
05:13 very close to each other and as they
05:15 grow apart
05:17 within the construct of the body and you
05:21 know I mean my god the amino acids that
05:23 become your your DNA change the protein
05:26 patterns that tell your amino acids what
05:28 to do these are all crystalline sort of
05:32 logic gate rules that are created by
05:34 ether winds locking up in a particular
05:36 way and so now do I believe in evolution
05:42 vs. God that's not really important in
05:45 this conversation we're talking about
05:49 what we are now we'll start from that
05:51 point but now imagine you know your
05:54 brain is going to different ways to
05:56 different completely isolated sets of
05:59 tubes that then you know connect in the
06:03 center at the but at the base we have
06:06 two eyes because it allows us to see
06:08 depth we have two ears so that we can
06:10 sense depth was sound that's why we only
06:15 have one mouth because there was no
06:17 dimensionality required by the mouth but
06:20 then inside the mouth we have teeth why
06:22 because if you were only chew with one
06:24 side of your mouth you'd be a really
06:25 weird creature symmetry we have our
06:30 lungs our ribcage pretty symmetrical our
06:34 kidneys very symmetrical only one
06:37 stomach one spleen one pancreas one
06:40 gallbladder we have a giant tube that is
06:43 our intestines our test dying spinal
06:47 cord is very symmetrical our arms and
06:50 our legs and our vascular system nervous
06:53 system it's all very symmetrical but now
06:56 isn't interesting when you see those
06:57 pictures when they show you a tree up
06:59 against the sky and then they show you
07:02 the vessels in the lungs
07:04 and you start to realize oh my god this
07:07 fit the physics that make us our
07:09 absolutes in the universe period now I
07:14 think it's easier if I said okay see
07:17 that tree this is the ether of particle
07:19 winds of life especially going up
07:21 through this tree and it simply does a
07:24 fractal dispersion and it's energy and
07:26 therefore you get smaller smaller
07:28 smaller until it's infinitely small now
07:30 eventually for us the fractal breaks
07:33 down and the branch doesn't go any
07:35 further as far as we know now the life
07:37 force imposed on top of it if we could
07:39 see it it might be this glowing Bell who
07:42 knows you know it's like the filament
07:44 and a bulb is very small but the light
07:47 that it gives off can light an entire
07:48 room so it could be something to that
07:50 effect and we could be I could be
07:52 sitting here bathing in the
07:53 consciousness of all these plants
07:56 because the forest field that goes
07:58 around their branches is way larger like
08:02 a magnetic pole around a cell phone but
08:06 now it may imagine all of these organs
08:08 that are not symmetrically placed in the
08:09 body
08:10 you know the liver it has a kind of a
08:14 weird shape but now what if one it was
08:17 creating itself a couple things are
08:21 happening it is in a very centered
08:24 spinal cord position and I'm sure I
08:27 could look all this up and find out but
08:28 I hate to even think how they figure
08:31 this stuff out but then it gets crunched
08:35 up by all the other stuff forming in the
08:37 gut and so it takes a particular node
08:40 over to the right side of your lower
08:43 ribcage and hides up in there right next
08:46 to the pancreas the pancreas is
08:49 symmetrical until know until gravity
08:51 starts taking over and other things are
08:54 bumping into it your intestinal tube
08:56 even though it is very asymmetrical in
08:58 placement I mean it's pretty balanced
09:01 and weight of course right but you have
09:03 your upper intestine then your middle
09:04 intestines your lower intestines
09:06 it comes down the right side of your
09:08 body goes down to your appendix then
09:10 rushes back up then Wiggles all the way
09:12 down that goes down the back side and
09:14 gets keep you know the two keeps getting
09:15 bigger and bigger and bigger and it's
09:16 diameter
09:17 it has slightly different purpose but
09:22 you take the tube and you look right
09:23 down the center and although the
09:25 diameter is changing and its absorption
09:29 capabilities are changing meaning like
09:31 the wallpaper at the top of your
09:33 intestines really grabbing all your
09:34 nutrients and then towards the end it
09:36 doesn't genetically that's because as
09:41 food exists in your body your body's
09:45 trying to assimilate the earliest
09:46 introduction of the food and as it goes
09:49 down into your lower intestine the food
09:51 is starting to diminish in its quality
09:53 it's starting to die and it doesn't want
09:56 to absorb that you know acidic food so
09:59 it's merely a holding point until you
10:01 pass your food but how many times have
10:05 we seen organs in the human body and
10:07 then some other inanimate object created
10:09 by just the universe that happens to
10:12 look very similar a bubble of water you
10:19 know looks sort of that sort of Halfmoon
10:20 contact lens of water
10:22 well it looks just like the butt in
10:26 front of the eyeball we look at you know
10:29 right down the barrel of a flower like a
10:32 daisy and then you look right down the
10:34 barrel of an eyeball and where one has
10:37 rose petals or petals and general excuse
10:39 me not rose petals completely different
10:41 design more of a Fibonacci pattern there
10:43 and then you look into an eye on it from
10:46 a daisy to an eye the petals have merely
10:48 turned into these stringy or the forms
10:52 of sort of holding up the the lens
10:55 that's just inside your eye the lens and
10:59 your eyes pretty damn amazing what's
11:02 interesting is is I'm trying to get to
11:04 the point where I can share a
11:05 conversation with someone who sees ether
11:07 the way I see it which is everywhere I
11:10 look around for me now I am seeing
11:15 everything renew itself constantly you
11:19 know I've got a bunch of maniman objects
11:20 that table right there I don't know how
11:22 long it's gonna sit out here I've got
11:24 this little coffee table over here I've
11:26 got that table that you see without a
11:28 top and the four chairs
11:30 that has been in my family since the mid
11:33 80s alright that was in that little
11:36 house in Kansas I appointed you guys
11:37 that even though it looks like it's just
11:41 sitting there and the rust patterns
11:43 don't change except to get larger and I
11:47 know it's not gonna deteriorate without
11:48 something catastrophic happening to it
11:50 it is still renewing its very beam the
11:54 particles that have decided to be the
11:57 iron that that thing is made out of have
11:59 been pushed into that shape in some
12:01 factory somewhere and sort of spot
12:05 welded together but because we know how
12:08 to manipulate by shear inheritance the
12:12 the tightly wound currents of ether
12:16 winds we are able to have things that we
12:23 create beyond just chopping down a tree
12:26 and building a log cabin out of it but
12:29 if you think about it that's how we
12:30 first started we found a cave and we hid
12:35 in it then we realized that we could dig
12:37 a cave we could do get right into a bed
12:40 bedrock you know just we learned that
12:43 rocks granite rock can hurt granite rock
12:46 if you can find granite rock and you
12:49 could hit it against sandstone which is
12:53 a beautiful rock in the Midwest of
12:55 Kansas I'm sure Europe has it all the
12:57 whole world probably has it around this
12:59 particular longitudinal ring it is super
13:02 soft and yet it's strong it's like a
13:03 lava rock almost but you can take a
13:06 heavy rock and pounded a weaker rock and
13:09 that is because that the atomic bonds
13:12 the the tight little loops of ether in
13:15 the granite rock are simply better
13:18 denser and the ones in the sandstone
13:21 aren't but the sandstone looks so sexy
13:25 doesn't it now there's all kinds of
13:28 beautiful things about the human body
13:29 that are related to survival of the
13:31 fittest you know that means there's a
13:36 bunch of funny ones you know at some
13:39 point man figured out
13:42 that the waste product that man produces
13:45 as a result of eating smells bad and
13:47 tastes bad I'm assuming okay and so we
13:52 didn't consume our waste product if we
13:56 had we would probably all have died off
13:59 really quickly and maybe a one
14:01 particular group somewhere in the
14:03 universe did that and they died out very
14:05 quickly so it we have it's a silly
14:09 example but the example is is that we
14:11 experimented in those that did dumb
14:14 things died through poison through not
14:18 realizing hey that's a cliff and you
14:20 don't have two eyes and so you have no
14:22 idea that that means down because you
14:25 look down and you're one little
14:27 cycloptic I made the ground come right
14:29 up to you just like the ground that's
14:31 under your feet and even though it was a
14:33 five hundred foot cliff and so they fell
14:36 off the edge and all the Cyclops died
14:39 now I'm gonna repeat some stuff from the
14:41 evolution episode because the
14:42 conversation for me and the vocabulary
14:45 and the way I talk about ether has so
14:48 significantly exploded in my mind I
14:50 think I can do a slightly better job but
14:54 one of the things I want you guys to
14:55 think about is the fact that all things
14:58 that are born are in some sort of
15:00 gravity bubble begin gravity is the push
15:03 not a pole you throw particles go
15:05 through damn near everything in the
15:07 entire universe however if you do use
15:10 like remember I just said granite can
15:12 hurt granite ether can block ether
15:15 nothing else in the universe as far as I
15:17 know could block ether but ether because
15:21 that's what everything's made out of so
15:24 if you create a regional bubble of fluid
15:26 original bubble that's called an egg at
15:29 a microscopic level especially at an
15:33 ether ol level at the very very
15:34 beginning we are able to create circular
15:37 objects that are called cells and within
15:41 that protection bubble we're able to
15:44 create other things but prior to the
15:46 cell even creating again I was involved
15:50 mostly at an academic level with folding
15:54 at home at Stanford I did their logo
15:56 point but I really really research the
15:59 hell out of it had a couple of great
16:00 conversation with pinja the guy that
16:03 runs the place dr. Pangaea I think I'm
16:06 saying his name right absolutely
16:08 wonderful man brilliant dude but if you
16:11 look at the average protein pattern in
16:14 the human body it is a really strange
16:16 looking thing it's like a stringy sort
16:18 of thing first conversation ever had
16:21 with him I have been using the SETI at
16:24 home project all over um you know
16:28 all the computers however touch I just
16:30 put SETI on and put my account in there
16:31 and walk away from it and you know if
16:33 someone found it and turned it off well
16:34 so so be it but I saw I got into I got
16:39 into the folding and home project
16:41 completely on my own and I get like I
16:42 said I kept going to Stanford all the
16:44 time once I discovered their library and
16:46 I started reading those you know buying
16:49 and reading the academic books and the
16:51 more hardcore postgraduate areas and I
16:55 saw Pangaea sitting eating lunch one day
17:00 real the day I think I was even with my
17:02 girlfriend you know let me talk to this
17:03 guy first split second I said aren't you
17:05 that guy and you know it was all these
17:07 things where he's academically brilliant
17:10 he's doing state-of-the-art computer
17:12 simulations of protein patterns folding
17:14 so they could find the way that they
17:16 fold that allows them to do protein
17:18 inhibitors and he looked at me at very
17:22 beginning of that conversation he within
17:25 five minutes he said he says protein
17:28 patterns are phenomenal it's okay we'll
17:31 keep going I'm listening I know very
17:33 little about them at the time and he
17:35 said well you know they folded like
17:37 faster than the speed of light whoa you
17:42 know he doesn't he didn't know me he
17:43 didn't know what I knew I think he
17:45 assumed I was a student on campus thank
17:48 God but now imagine that everything is
17:51 made out of this ether of stuff and it's
17:54 average speed is the 50 times the speed
17:56 of light speed now the verb of light
18:00 seems to be one fiftieth of that speed
18:04 even though it varies and it changes and
18:06 I just put an article that said that the
18:08 speed of light is slowing down
18:09 so that's really interesting and makes
18:12 complete sense that you know the
18:13 universe is an organic substrate of
18:16 particles and if you know if there's
18:20 just a change in the density of the
18:22 universe where we are with ether
18:23 particles due to something else going on
18:25 you know the butterfly and Peru thing
18:27 then yeah we could probably experience
18:29 even our own existence slow down for a
18:31 split second but perhaps we don't really
18:33 notice it who knows but when you look at
18:38 these protein patterns and you think
18:40 about them folding very quickly
18:42 they're simply inheriting the wave of
18:46 energy that goes through them now how
18:49 many of you have ever seen you've done
18:51 this yourself as a child or you've seen
18:53 internet videos of it were a child or a
18:56 dog or even just a garden hose out by
18:59 itself with water going through it on
19:01 these thinner ones it's going crazy and
19:04 there's little toys that do it you know
19:06 the kids can play in water toys you put
19:08 put it through and it's going nuts right
19:10 there's the big fan things that car
19:12 dealerships used to get you to look at
19:14 them or the people who file your taxes
19:16 they push win through the sock and it's
19:18 you know a person thing okay
19:21 luckily we're not flipping around and
19:23 flapping around like one of these
19:24 objects because we have a very
19:26 structured high order what I always call
19:31 a high order construct which is the
19:33 human body we have a bunch of ether
19:35 particles that have settled on their
19:37 spend relationships they have formed
19:39 bonds with each other meaning sharing
19:41 the orbital pattern of this renewing
19:44 ether it's constantly going through us
19:46 you know so we have structure so we're
19:50 not a noodle but perhaps our protein
19:54 patterns because they are so small I
19:56 mean a gigantic compared to an average
19:59 ether a particle right and it would be I
20:00 don't even know what the ratio would be
20:02 but who would they're they're huge so
20:08 because the protein pattern is bigger
20:10 than an ether particle you're not going
20:13 to get a one well a fifty a one to one
20:15 correlation over its speed going through
20:18 the object right a 50 to 50 speed
20:21 increase so the reason why the protein
20:22 powders
20:23 likely do not fold it 50 times the speed
20:25 of light is there a bigger thing and so
20:28 it takes more and so maybe an average
20:32 protein pattern is 5 million times
20:36 bigger than the single ether a particle
20:37 may be 5 billion trillion I don't know
20:39 but it starts to slow down because it
20:43 takes a lot of kinetic energy to make it
20:46 occur but this whole thing and I mean I
20:49 have never heard a single evolutionary
20:53 article ever suggest maybe they have
20:59 that hey look at you look at the gravity
21:02 bubble of which everything creates
21:04 itself it's as if life can't be created
21:08 without a bubble and I don't mean the
21:11 cells I mean the overall structure of
21:13 the womb in which things create
21:16 themselves for turtles and chickens and
21:18 alligators that lay eggs they have left
21:21 behind a little gravity bubble that
21:26 although extremely weak is very useful
21:29 when the protein patterns are folding
21:34 dictating nucleic acid chains and how
21:37 they form themselves inside the
21:39 chromosome of a cell so the cells get
21:41 sort of this quarantined Genesis within
21:46 the 3d bubble the 3d gravity bubble that
21:51 is an egg or a womb now of course eggs
21:54 and wombs also provide nutrients and
21:57 safety and all kinds of great things and
21:58 that needs to be there as well and I
22:02 think that's where the conversation
22:03 typically stops it doesn't go to the
22:05 genetic level and the mechanical
22:08 composition level of our existence but
22:11 down if you think about it why do we say
22:14 that a human being dies I just forget
22:17 all the horrific methods so that we'd
22:19 pass just think about someone dying of
22:22 old age there be there's just big smile
22:24 on their face they're in bed they just
22:27 close their eyes and they go to bed and
22:29 that's it there there now pronounced
22:31 dead and why is that well because the
22:36 machine that is their autonomic system
22:38 their nervous system their heartbeat to
22:40 all of the neurological messages that
22:42 were traveling their entire life
22:43 communicating with their body turns off
22:49 it's empty you're looking at the bio
22:53 matter that was animated by the
22:56 relationship that it had most likely
22:58 with its soul they kept this whole thing
23:01 going and so once the state change
23:04 starts to cease to be anything other
23:07 than the decay which is the universe
23:09 acting upon that body before that it's
23:13 called life after that it's called death
23:16 now you just yanking out of your
23:18 brainstem and you're off back in the
23:21 universe to do whatever you want to do
23:24 with things right when it comes to and I
23:28 and I haven't really mentioned this but
23:30 we're gonna we're gonna do a clinical
23:32 analysis of say a ghost or an apparition
23:35 that you can see what would be and I'm
23:38 not talking about the mind's eye kind
23:40 that's that's different that's a
23:41 neurological probably soul bumping into
23:43 soul thing I'm talking about the ones
23:45 because they just mentioned it enough so
23:46 that's coming out here shortly it will
23:49 have released before this episode but
23:50 you know a light apparition there's all
23:54 these claims that these cameras have
23:56 taken photographs of them including just
23:59 people who have passed in photographs I
24:01 mean it's inputs wild the little orbs of
24:03 light is another one the amount of
24:06 people that believe that orbs are
24:08 spirits is astonishingly high it's very
24:11 interesting I have really no opinion I
24:13 know that if you are shooting with a
24:15 digital camera in a moist outside
24:17 environment this is a phenomenon we have
24:21 tracked a million times in
24:23 cinematographers and photographers have
24:27 methods of compete of combating these
24:29 particles of water that then get hit by
24:32 a light and then it goes into the what
24:34 is it the CCD analog to digital
24:36 converter and so they they fight that so
24:40 if you believe in orders just know that
24:41 it's something very formal that
24:42 photographers steer around and they know
24:45 exactly the environmental conditions
24:47 where this occurs in its moisture
24:50 could be fog could be a little light
24:51 drizzle something like that it doesn't
24:53 have to be anything you could feel but
24:56 now let's talk about for one second this
25:00 is just a kind of a nice little
25:01 digression we're gonna use ether to
25:03 describe this or the soul if you want or
25:07 both if you're going to see an
25:09 apparition how would that occur well
25:14 it's not that I haven't heard someone
25:17 prophecies or sorry shits but it's the
25:19 wrong word someone claimed that there
25:22 was darkness that was you know blocking
25:26 light being an apparition but that's
25:28 like maybe a fraction of a single
25:30 percent of people that say they see
25:31 ghosts most the time when they see a
25:33 ghost they're seeing a light induced
25:36 apparition photons are being created in
25:39 the universe and they're going into your
25:41 eyeball and you are sensing the shape of
25:43 somebody in front of you okay if we
25:48 break that down from a scientific
25:50 standpoint that would mean that the soul
25:52 energy that's still floating around the
25:53 universe has found a way or maybe
25:57 naturally makes this happen but they are
26:03 exciting the fabric of the universe
26:05 which is ether oh particles into sort of
26:09 it would be as if a ghost walked into
26:11 your pool broad daylight you're looking
26:14 at a still pool there is not a single
26:17 gust of wind and all sudden there's
26:21 ripples in that water as if someone is
26:23 walking through the water you can see
26:24 their waistline which is kind of this
26:26 null area right but around them they're
26:28 creating ripples those ripples would be
26:31 the waves of light and the water would
26:34 be ether now you take that up to a
26:36 three-dimensional level instead of a 2d
26:37 point in your pool and you might have
26:40 some interference with the fabric of the
26:44 universe that might produce an
26:45 apparition
26:46 now we're gonna Pierce this and parse
26:49 this a little bit more when I was a kid
26:51 one of the things they put on TV once
26:53 and I mean we're talking the 70s was
26:55 they were they were somewhere I believe
26:57 in Europe I know they were in Europe but
26:59 they had filmed well I guess I guess I
27:02 think they were in Europe
27:03 but they were filming this colonial
27:05 house that was very notorious for having
27:08 apparitions and they had filmed this
27:11 room and over a long period of time you
27:14 see just like a transporter from Star
27:17 Trek beaming in a body this sort of
27:22 clothing of some type of soldier it's
27:26 very much like the pants that Prince
27:28 wore where he had the diagonal buttons
27:30 in the front and at a man I think wore
27:31 the same sort of thing because they're
27:32 the colonial pants right there like
27:35 Minuteman pants that's what I saw when I
27:38 looked at it and so we're looking at an
27:42 apparition that according to this film
27:44 and this could be all crap who knows but
27:47 if it's true it'd be interesting to
27:48 examine it but what was going on is we
27:51 were only getting sort of the waist high
27:53 a little bit maybe six inches over the
27:55 belt line six and it's just below the
27:57 belt line apparition of this body and
27:59 and whatever was creating this light was
28:03 only taking the form of the beam well if
28:07 someone is splashing ether particles
28:10 into the the verbal reaction that we
28:13 know is light then they would merely
28:15 most likely be creating a halo around
28:18 themselves as they walk through and
28:20 maybe they do or don't modify it within
28:25 their their structure whatever shape you
28:30 might be as a soul the weird thing about
28:33 ghosts having clothing okay is there
28:37 would be absolutely no logic in that
28:38 whatsoever even if we completely prove
28:42 that there was a soul the very next
28:45 thing we probably would not say would be
28:47 that you keep your dress you keep your
28:51 suit you keep your hair if nothing else
28:55 you know maybe you keep some imprint of
28:58 what your body used to look like because
29:00 your soul was living in the pattern of
29:01 your body and so you do have two arms
29:03 and two legs but you might be buck naked
29:06 how would you have the ability to take
29:09 on clothing I mean this on this
29:12 alternate you know universe that's on
29:16 top of this one
29:17 I shouldn't really say
29:19 alternate-universe but you know the
29:20 other layer that is not as visible as my
29:27 possum is over there he likes to show he
29:31 likes to get it live but now let's look
29:34 at the let's go back to the womb let's
29:37 go back to the inception of life itself
29:40 what's very interesting is is that the
29:42 sperm and the egg have their own life
29:44 force the egg is already prepared for
29:47 the gravity bubble that will be
29:50 necessary to incubate up the life that
29:53 is going to exist and this is where you
29:54 get into a huge chicken and egg
29:56 conversation of which one came first
29:59 don't know but we know eggs exist for
30:02 all beings so the egg has a single hole
30:06 in it a single hole and there's one
30:09 sperm that puts his little head in there
30:10 and his tail is made really long for one
30:13 purpose to block the back block that
30:15 hole I guess on the occasion of twins
30:20 either the egg has two holes in it or
30:23 somehow the first sperm goes in there
30:26 and crawls all the way in and another
30:29 one calls in as well who knows it could
30:33 be the way that it subdivides I haven't
30:35 really studied that actually I just know
30:37 when you go on fertility drugs
30:39 holy jesus you get eight kids in one
30:41 shot but now think about the infant essa
30:44 Multi knee tiny level of an ether a
30:46 particle and how violent and amazing it
30:50 must be to see them pounding on each
30:52 other at their level and then take that
30:57 up a few orders of magnitude because we
30:59 need to get to the particles that were
31:01 made out of the what we call an atom and
31:05 then we start watching them behave and
31:08 they're you know they're so chaotic you
31:10 can either no word direction and vector
31:12 they're going in or speed they're going
31:14 in but or you can know where they are
31:16 you can't know both right the Heisenberg
31:17 uncertainty principle which you know
31:20 whatever that III levels I I think you
31:25 can only look at perhaps the current in
31:27 the river is going a particular
31:29 direction or
31:30 you know the current in the oceans going
31:32 a particular direction that's pretty
31:33 much all you can do is give it up to
31:35 some observation onto these things a
31:39 sphere is you know in its purest form
31:43 the most perfect symmetrical object you
31:46 can have in the universe because
31:49 regardless if the sphere if the sphere
31:51 is made out of things that are shaped
31:52 like rice or things that are shaped like
31:54 tetrahedrons as long as they move in a
31:57 particular manner and bang into each
31:59 other and create an orbital bubble in
32:01 space that can be construed as some
32:04 atomic fundamental particle which then
32:07 can combine with other particles and
32:10 they could they could bump their edges
32:11 together and then start creating imagine
32:14 you have two spheres that are being held
32:15 in place by banging particles and then
32:20 they they get to each other and they
32:23 touch their edges together now all the
32:24 sudden they start sharing their orbital
32:27 cloud and now you have a figure eight
32:30 going on between them they're going back
32:32 and forth sustaining both but now
32:35 they're combined their union when I see
32:39 the human mind and it's submit is
32:42 symmetry the lungs the pelvis the human
32:47 body I'm starting to see a chronology in
32:50 how these things are created such that
32:53 the more symmetrical you're more
32:55 symmetrical organs and parts that were
32:57 built out of most likely went first at a
32:59 more infantile stage and the more unique
33:05 and asymmetrical objects in organs we
33:09 have in our bodies they went second and
33:12 perhaps they're getting there obviously
33:14 getting there there an inkling DNA early
33:19 because everything is starting to grow
33:21 but you know if you are getting your
33:23 digestive nutrition from your mother
33:28 then there are organs of which we use
33:31 when we get out of our mothers the most
33:34 functions such that we can grab our own
33:36 nutrients we have to have our teeth in
33:39 our mouth and our saliva hole I justice
33:42 system has to turn on
33:44 because we have the umbilical cord right
33:46 away we don't need our eyes and our ears
33:49 that much I mean I'm making an
33:52 assumption of course but your ears start
33:54 on your cheeks and they move back
33:57 towards your ears where they are you
34:01 know again I had a friend of mine in
34:02 school who I've just recently made
34:04 contact with but I went to school with
34:07 him in 4th and 5th grade I should guess
34:11 half a 3rd 4th and 5th and he had one of
34:15 his ears hadn't completely gone all the
34:18 way back so he had sort of the it just
34:21 it was a his earlobes a little strange
34:22 and the one on his left side had never
34:24 moved all the way back and so it was on
34:27 the side of his head and it had no hole
34:29 I guess Paul Stanley has one of those
34:31 ears so what happens something happens
34:36 where the movement doesn't occur for
34:38 whatever reason but think about your
34:42 eyes they go last with your ears you
34:45 don't need them you're listening to your
34:47 universe perhaps before you even you
34:49 definitely don't see much right inside
34:52 your mom I guess I'm kind of glad I
34:55 don't know what the inside of my mom
34:57 looks like those are memories I will
34:59 gladly wholesale out there but as we try
35:05 to simulate life in computers and they
35:09 used to be that a life program they made
35:10 I believe its first incarnation was in
35:13 the early 70s where it's just these
35:15 little rules where these pixels crawl
35:17 across the screen and the pixels are
35:19 being refreshed by an algorithm that
35:20 goes from the top left to the bottom
35:21 right and scanning and scanning and
35:23 scanning and it has rules if you're by a
35:25 particular pixel you may based on where
35:29 you were before and what movement you're
35:31 going in you may be able to combine with
35:34 that and become a bigger object it was a
35:37 beautiful algorithm but it was all based
35:39 on the more you could sit and watch life
35:41 programs run for hours it's just crazy
35:43 if you thought looking at a progress bar
35:46 was entrancing at some point believe me
35:48 if you're a coder you have to fall in
35:49 love with those things we we have to I
35:54 think understand the chronology of
35:57 how we create based on not just x-raying
36:01 a bunch of baby fetuses unfortunately
36:05 but the relationship we have with this
36:08 single particle in the universe the
36:10 controls absolutely everything again it
36:12 doesn't negate God at all this is God's
36:14 little it is it's his creation I mean if
36:18 if God exists then the ether a particle
36:20 is one of the most masterful things ever
36:23 created because it gives you this
36:25 illusion of energy that's electrical and
36:28 it gives you the illusion of inanimate
36:31 matter like a dirt clod it gives us love
36:37 beings these souls that we have a medium
36:40 to live in a temporary form and then -
36:45 if you think about it we have this this
36:50 again historical histogram of our
36:53 history that we get to enjoy it's
36:57 amazing so we are plugged into this
36:58 ultimate database that is the universe
37:00 with all solutions and all knowledge of
37:02 all things because it most likely just
37:04 is it's just there everything that could
37:07 possibly be thought up by mankind is
37:09 just sitting there finished the only
37:12 thing we're doing is sneaking into the
37:13 Indiana Jones warehouse and saying whoo
37:16 this is a box of sci-fi movies and no
37:18 one's ever seen I'm gonna go take them
37:19 back to my world and write them down so
37:21 people can come see them so the human
37:25 body is usually something to marvel at
37:29 it no matter what your IQ is you simply
37:31 go oh my god this is amazing but it all
37:34 works that life can be produced by us
37:37 life being hey you're able to do to your
37:42 creators design to create another vessel
37:46 a shoe box by which shoes can fit inside
37:50 the shoe box and you know if you build
37:52 it they will come sort of thing I know
37:54 the line has changed because of the
37:56 mandel effect but screw that but there's
37:59 this interesting relationship and what's
38:01 really fascinating about this is the
38:03 following
38:04 if we copulate and impregnate each other
38:10 here's what's interesting now there are
38:15 situations and we won't get into the
38:16 details but there are rare occasions
38:18 when life never shows up in the womb
38:23 regardless of the I would say no
38:28 conscious life seems to show up in a
38:31 very rare circumstance it's it's a very
38:36 tumultuous thing to experience but it is
38:41 very rare but even if something goes
38:44 wrong in the child inside the mother for
38:47 whatever reason the life force is still
38:50 there the consciousness is still there
38:52 it is I mean you can you can want to use
38:57 you know birth control or sorry abortion
38:59 as a birth control mechanism but
39:02 nothing's ever going to stop the fact
39:03 that that life has a soul attached to it
39:06 now at the same time that might sound
39:09 like I'm judging I firmly believe that
39:13 once we pass away for any reason
39:16 whatsoever the soul does return to the
39:19 universe and really goes in a circle so
39:23 I am very disappointed with the 13
39:28 states of the United States that are now
39:30 allowing nine-month abortions so because
39:35 someone's a narcissist you know if you
39:38 go nine months have it and let someone
39:40 adopt it would you
39:42 hell you can eight months you can do the
39:44 same thing but anyway we make a vessel
39:49 and life shows up to possess the vessel
39:52 I mean is that not amazing right if you
39:56 believe in a soul it becomes orders of
40:00 magnitude more amazing than just the bag
40:03 of chemicals thing now just published
40:06 this morning the previous lives episode
40:08 and so this is sort of the an ether all
40:14 extension on two
40:17 the next stage you know going back to
40:20 the drawing board of life as it exists
40:24 now what's interesting is is you have
40:28 especially in Asia a number of fighting
40:32 styles which talk about the Chi and
40:35 there's Asian cultures that live within
40:38 the Chi and you know I know that there
40:42 are many cultures that have various
40:46 implementations of interacting with this
40:48 stuff the Hindus have their own chakra
40:51 mechanisms so I am talking about the
40:53 same thing what I like about the way
40:55 that China talks about it is it is very
40:58 simple for the mind to completely grasp
41:01 as I've had it described to me multiple
41:04 times by women who are you know I guess
41:08 you could call them Chi experts they're
41:12 essentially a masseuse but unlike the
41:15 the masseuse is here in America the the
41:18 the older like 50s and you know aged 50
41:22 or above Asian women that engage in real
41:26 massage there they consider themselves
41:28 to be doctors not just masseuses your
41:32 acupuncturist is dealing with the energy
41:35 meridians of the body and making sure
41:37 that it's it's completely unrestricted
41:40 it flows through well through your body
41:42 etc etc what I love about that is that
41:47 they are on a level where they have
41:49 combined the physical with the
41:50 metaphysical sort of my infinity project
41:52 but they keep it beautiful and simple
41:56 they believe they can stimulate your
41:58 foot and make each one of your organs
42:00 feel better to detoxify combined with
42:05 acupuncture you get the the benefit of
42:08 both worlds right I've got an
42:10 acupuncture place right next to my smoke
42:13 lounge I need to go in there and have
42:15 the experience and what's interesting is
42:18 the integrity that I have heard from
42:20 close friends of mine you've got
42:22 acupuncture it's very interesting in
42:23 America they'll take your money for
42:26 anything and I got you know the world's
42:29 that way and
42:29 but what I find interesting is is that
42:32 some of my friends have gone into
42:33 acupuncture places very excited to get
42:37 treatments and they said you know it was
42:40 sort of it was sort of interesting
42:42 because the doctor who did it and I know
42:46 they're the doctor in their realm but
42:49 they said that this person would set
42:51 them down and interview them about why
42:53 they want any acupuncture at all why do
42:55 you need my services I don't know I've
42:59 never done this before
43:00 well tell me how you feel and if you
43:03 said you felt stressful or you had any
43:05 ailment whatsoever they're just writing
43:06 all that down because that starts to
43:08 give them the map of a human body that
43:10 they are going to stimulate to bring
43:12 more Chi through the body now what do we
43:16 say about death and the clinical death
43:19 in this world is that when the body
43:21 ceases to animate and it's autonomic
43:24 system is no longer functioning the
43:26 voltage systems off now you're simply
43:28 decaying we call that death of the human
43:32 body not of the body I mean out of the
43:34 the soul the mind goes away because the
43:38 mind is the amalgamation of the soul and
43:40 the body together it is that virtual
43:43 states of the CPU but if you pull the
43:46 power out of a computer you'll have a
43:48 hard drive a lot of data on it but the
43:50 CPU starts to clear out and that's
43:52 basically death and human body the power
43:55 is the soul it pulls out computer turns
43:58 off and maybe you know if there's a
44:02 little bit of digital storage in the
44:05 tubes of the brain which I'm not
44:06 convinced there's a single single lick
44:09 of fat going on maybe your hard drive
44:12 still has the archive of what you used
44:14 to know but you're no longer there to
44:17 use it you're off in the universe
44:20 massage I've told you guys several times
44:23 that I think massage is extremely
44:25 important for the human body I think
44:27 it's important because it unlocks your
44:29 meridians the lines of which your body
44:31 operates on to keep everything
44:33 communicating with itself but the Chi
44:36 and the religion of the Chi is to ensure
44:39 that that doesn't diminish
44:42 and what's interesting is what is the
44:44 stereotype about Asian people and aging
44:46 they aged beautifully unbelievable
44:49 you can't tell for a long time whether
44:53 or not an asian woman is maybe thirty or
44:56 sixty it's like there's this thirty
44:59 years span in the area like she could be
45:02 sixty or thirty one you just don't know
45:06 white people sometimes that happens
45:09 sometimes it doesn't
45:11 most of times there's indicators very
45:13 quickly in a white person that we're
45:15 aging our necks get wrinkly or whatever
45:19 of course white people get obese so you
45:21 can just count off the pounds but
45:23 nowadays younger kids are all into this
45:28 fat shaming horseshit and it's like okay
45:31 we're not trying to make fun of people
45:33 who are fat we're trying to keep you
45:36 alive and healthy and happy so you can
45:40 do things like run you know go the
45:43 restroom without taking a shower right
45:45 after right so I love this idea that
45:49 there are you know all these cultures
45:52 around the world that have simply done
45:54 that experiment I talked about in
45:57 detecting God where they have sat down
45:59 and there there are no indoctrination
46:01 schools you have to sit and listen to
46:03 your mind listen to the universe it's
46:05 the only game in town and so that's how
46:08 you figure out everything and so the
46:11 Hindus went one way with chakras your
46:14 Asian cultures have you know not all of
46:16 them but a lot of them have the Chi and
46:18 you know I was always told that my Chi
46:19 entry point is at the base of my spine
46:24 you know I think that we have to keep
46:27 the universe going through us and be
46:30 healthy enough to let that happen
46:31 why is inflammation bad inflammation is
46:34 bad because it blocks the flow of your
46:36 blood going through your body well the
46:39 blood carries all the nutrients and all
46:41 of the oxygen all of the immune system
46:44 if you take vitamins it distributes the
46:46 vitamins around your body so you must
46:48 stay in shape to an extent you know to
46:52 be a washboard abs guy I don't know if
46:54 that's even good for you
46:55 but you must stay in a particular state
46:57 to be healthy we also have a limited
47:00 supply of what we create in the human
47:03 body this little little bit of a
47:08 diversion here but it's kind of the next
47:09 progressive topic to discuss if we put a
47:14 lot of chemicals in our body and mess
47:16 with the natural production of things we
47:19 eat too much sugar we take too many
47:22 drugs that stimulate the dopamine
47:24 production in the brain anything that
47:27 makes you high
47:28 is stimulating the dopamine in your body
47:30 and so you will run out of it the next
47:34 day
47:34 and you might be very depressed you
47:36 might have no energy and be fine but
47:39 you're still not who you are and who
47:41 you're supposed to be and so this this
47:45 knee-jerk reaction that is I'm gonna
47:48 take a drug because life sucks you're
47:51 going to make life suck even more and
47:55 that's not what someone wants to hear
47:57 when they think about this but that's
47:58 the god-honest truth and here's another
48:01 way to bring back to ether this
48:03 conversation we are built a particular
48:08 way to interact with the universe in a
48:10 particular way our uniqueness is merely
48:13 our conscious choice to participate in
48:15 the universe in an active way one way or
48:18 the other am I going to hug someone am I
48:20 going to build a shelter am I gonna go
48:23 hunt food you're interacting with a
48:26 universe and you're not disturbing your
48:28 body except to bring hopefully yourself
48:30 so nutrients and water get some rest
48:33 procreate take care of the mind body and
48:36 soul of your offspring or someone else's
48:39 offspring your village that is the true
48:42 cycle of life consuming narcotics just
48:47 consuming hallucinogenics not exercising
48:50 all those other things that are atypical
48:53 and contradictory the way that we have
48:56 been designed to interact with the
48:57 universe are all going to have side
49:00 effects that you don't like now that's
49:04 why we always say moderation you give
49:05 your body ability to heal itself
49:09 I have friends of mine that won't and
49:13 I'm kind of in the middle on this it all
49:15 this doesn't gross you out but so I have
49:16 some friends that will wash their hands
49:18 constantly use that Perel [ __ ] on their
49:22 hands constantly right they're always
49:24 sick why because their immune system is
49:27 at zero because they're constantly using
49:29 chemicals on their body on their
49:31 epidermis which they absorb to get rid
49:34 of germs and all this other stuff at the
49:36 college I used to work out down the
49:37 street there's these hand sanitizer
49:40 dispensers everywhere around the college
49:42 I think about only thirty percent of the
49:45 entire population of the college has the
49:48 orientation solid enough to even
49:50 procreate human beings it's just crazy
49:54 but I have other friends in mind that
49:56 are more rustic and they never wash
49:58 their hands ever if they drop their food
50:01 on the ground I'll just pick her back up
50:03 brush the sprinkles off eat it and
50:07 there's an amazing philosophy between
50:10 the two when you talk to the parrell
50:11 hand sanitizer folks which Douglas Adams
50:15 used to make a lot of fun of those like
50:17 make fun of those folks they're
50:20 hypochondriacs the grasp of reality and
50:24 their biological do's and dont's the
50:28 immune system they know nothing about
50:30 any of that stuff on average on average
50:33 some people might know too much and they
50:35 become mr. Pratt from Creepshow you know
50:41 but my friends who are rustic here's
50:43 what's interesting about them they
50:46 barely ever get sick it's amazing
50:49 their whole philosophy is I need to eat
50:51 all the germs that I am surrounded by
50:52 constantly so my immune system you
50:54 become familiarized with them and so I
50:58 never get sick and then I don't have to
51:00 take the antibiotics that you take and
51:02 that's the case in the Midwest when I
51:06 used to live there you know you have
51:11 your city dweller then you have your
51:13 Urban's country dweller and then you
51:15 have your true rustic cowboy that lives
51:20 on a farm their rancher
51:22 the maybe they sell Bulls cattle
51:25 livestock maybe they just break horses
51:27 for a living they're as healthy as an ox
51:32 man they live for a very long time and
51:35 they live very high quality lives but
51:37 all these city slickers who think
51:38 they've got it all made dying in their
51:40 60s cancer heart attacks now the quest
51:46 to live forever is sort of a ridiculous
51:48 quest but I mean in human form I think
51:50 it's just nuts but you know again it
51:53 just depends you know what I always tell
51:54 my friends and who I think are in cycles
51:58 of like incredible self-destruction and
52:00 abuse as I say look man you really want
52:03 to think about this I said you know
52:05 would you go next door and get a tattoo
52:07 on your face of course not all right why
52:10 is that well because it's forever and
52:12 you can't get it you can't take it off
52:14 and it's a decision I'm making today
52:16 that I even if I could rationalize such
52:18 a thing I wouldn't want it when I'm 65
52:21 years old and have grandkids and I look
52:22 like a monster
52:23 am i great then you completely
52:25 understand the next thing I'm about to
52:26 say well I make a bunch of forever
52:28 decisions about your body when you're
52:31 too young to appreciate what forever
52:32 means and eating shitty food is one of
52:36 those things the reason for this episode
52:39 is to see the ecosystem of our existence
52:42 as matter based beings but also to see
52:45 the tethering symbiotic relationship we
52:49 have with our souls now when I talked
52:53 about the human body is probably the
52:56 most complex form of life that we know
52:59 of in the universe like I said in a
53:01 previous episode recently the human body
53:04 is more complex than a galaxy it is the
53:07 galaxies just some you know a rain drain
53:12 of ether particles swirling into some
53:15 center core doing to the due to the
53:19 obstruction of ether which creates a
53:21 push a negative pressure in the universe
53:23 which draws things together there's no
53:26 exchange of mass information until they
53:30 get within proximity to do so there's no
53:33 Big Bang there's no black hole okay
53:35 how many of you have seen cactus and
53:38 various plants that are just infested
53:40 with the Fibonacci pattern you look down
53:43 on them and you can see the spiral of
53:44 all the little cactus petals coming up
53:49 why does it just look just like a
53:52 Fibonacci pattern why does the rose
53:55 petals come out like a Fibonacci pattern
53:57 because it's it is more of a slave to
54:02 the ether of particles than we are for
54:05 whatever reason whatever decides
54:07 whatever makes us what we are is far
54:10 more complex and glorious and amazing
54:13 right but now let me let me throw this
54:17 little extra bonus at you that we know
54:21 that because of well but this way anyone
54:23 over 50 who grew up without the internet
54:27 for sure has the benefit of
54:30 understanding what society used to be
54:32 like when we used to interact with each
54:33 other and the beautiful nature of that
54:37 existence if you wanted to have any air
54:39 and interaction with human beings you go
54:41 down to the pool hall you go down
54:42 through the barbecue joint you sit out
54:44 in front of the gas station you sit out
54:46 in from your backyard you drag your
54:48 folding chair over to your buddy's house
54:50 instead of his front yard we had to see
54:52 each other
54:54 but now how many people live these
54:56 beautiful lifes and they're botanists
54:58 they have amazing front yards and back
55:00 yard it's full of all these plants palm
55:03 trees and flowers and all kinds of stuff
55:06 and they're just in this little special
55:08 place well what if the life force that
55:16 inhabits an inanimate object is we call
55:18 it made of ether is an antenna of life
55:23 so take the previous theory I gave you
55:26 that if we could really look at the life
55:28 force coming out of a tree or a bush or
55:31 a flower or whatever is much larger than
55:36 the actual object itself take that
55:37 little cactus right yeah some of these
55:40 cactus get you know like a foot in
55:41 diameter and you look down on them and
55:42 there's this beautiful Fibonacci spiral
55:44 well imagine that
55:47 spitting off the tips of those petals is
55:51 its life force which is obviously
55:54 probably related to my life force
55:56 because the thing is is all these were
55:59 particles work together in the universe
56:01 to create all these different shapes
56:02 that we are okay well now wouldn't life
56:07 be an e throw particle in some form hmm
56:11 it gets us down to being one being and
56:14 we are merely I am a thumb talking and
56:17 you're a finger you're an index finger
56:18 talking why are you talking but perhaps
56:22 the more life that you surround yourself
56:23 with the more that you enjoy life the
56:29 more that you have perhaps epiphanies
56:32 perhaps you have less stress because you
56:36 know if you built a bridge out of a
56:38 single pile on and you had big long
56:42 beams that wouldn't break and you put
56:45 that one pile on in the middle probably
56:47 not a really long bridge but even if it
56:49 was that single pylon is taking all the
56:51 stress of the entire bridge now
56:53 structural engineers typically don't
56:55 build bridges like that because of
56:56 redundancy you want a pylon to be able
57:00 to say let's say I could hold a hundred
57:01 tons and so if that one pylon breaks the
57:06 whole bridge goes down and all the life
57:07 on the bridge dies or severely injured
57:10 so no one designs anything like that you
57:12 build them out of multiple pylons and
57:14 pillars to distribute say a hundred tons
57:18 over ten pylons that can handle a
57:21 hundred tons and that way if one breaks
57:23 the bridge is fine
57:25 engineers don't even worry yeah and they
57:27 they want to get it fixed quickly but
57:29 it's okay so if you're one human being
57:33 all by yourself and during the entire
57:37 world's pressures on you as you perceive
57:39 them to exist then you got a lot of
57:42 pressure on you but if you were to hang
57:45 out with other people even if they're
57:47 not participating directly in your cause
57:50 and effect of stress you're sort of
57:53 getting rejuvenated by your friends
57:55 sitting around you and again social
57:58 media no matter how amazing it gets will
58:00 never replace some
58:01 sitting in the room with you it's
58:04 starting to rain here let me do a
58:06 sign-off if you have mid to deep
58:08 thoughts radio.com please go there's
58:11 audio video lock Facebook group a
58:13 Twitter page a patreon account and a
58:15 PayPal page take care of yourself and
58:19 someone else and I'll see in the next
