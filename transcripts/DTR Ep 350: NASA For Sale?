00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this episode we are going
00:39 to discuss the New Deal used rocket
00:44 program that seems to be something that
00:47 people can buy now a third-world country
00:50 with self-esteem issues someone trying
00:54 to look good at the top of their country
00:58 faking these [ __ ] Rovers to the moon
01:02 sorry for the f-bombs people thing is if
01:06 you're gonna be a person's gonna deal
01:08 with this information I don't think
01:09 you're necessarily leading the PTA you
01:14 know I'm saying we've had to fake Rovers
01:17 on the moon by China they are seemingly
01:23 handling this by themselves because they
01:25 can't seem to synchronize what we faked
01:30 back in the 60s and again what's really
01:33 hilarious is that NASA sent Bob Shipman
01:38 they've sent one two three four
01:40 functional Rovers to Mars supposedly but
01:44 not one goddamn Rover to the moon and
01:47 why is that well Jesus nowadays since we
01:50 had a Rovers two Rovers that are only
01:52 supposed to have last like 11 months go
01:55 for [ __ ] 18 years I mean it's not
01:59 quite that long but you know over 15
02:01 years what's really really funny I'll
02:05 get back to that point the people I
02:07 talked to they don't give a [ __ ] about
02:10 any of this stuff especially females
02:13 I'll start in with like the moon hoax
02:16 thing and they'll be like oh wait wait
02:17 what is this [ __ ] with this these Rovers
02:19 is still work on Mars like you got me
02:22 they said I can't keep anything in my
02:25 house that runs on batteries going for
02:28 any length of time especially a laptop
02:30 how on earth were these Rovers able to
02:33 last so long of course there's supposed
02:35 to be solar panel charged but then again
02:39 there's horrific storms supposedly on
02:42 the surface of Mars it's all out of a
02:45 ray bradbury book let me just tell you
02:47 right
02:48 way but the little Rovers are supposed
02:50 to flap their wings shake it all off
02:53 right well why don't we just make our
02:56 cars shake the [ __ ] dirt off because
02:58 that works right would you don't
03:01 understand there's no there's no
03:02 moisture in the surface of Mars so all
03:04 this just easily falls off well I guess
03:07 when you live in a fairytale land you're
03:09 never without solutions right
03:12 theoretically everyone's up my ass about
03:15 saying that astronauts would still float
03:17 on the [ __ ] moon
03:18 because the algorithms obviously the
03:21 rate of a descent they calculate
03:24 terminal velocity terminal velocity
03:27 terminal velocity how the [ __ ] do you
03:29 have any equation terminate when it is
03:32 just a log resident logarithmic equation
03:34 of gravity believe me I know there's an
03:38 explanation but it's [ __ ] horseshit
03:40 if the moon is blocking your ether o
03:43 winds that would normally be going up
03:44 your hole and lifting you up then you're
03:48 gonna be pushed down you throw winds or
03:50 ether winds now let's just say the ocean
03:55 is really huge you'd be a little
03:57 knowledge of here
03:57 you know big giant ocean it's ten miles
04:00 deep and you're standing on the bottom
04:03 of the ocean and we want to know how
04:04 much you're gonna get crushed to pieces
04:07 just by the faulty metric water above
04:09 your head would it matter what's
04:13 underneath you as long as you got ten
04:16 miles of water over your head well the
04:20 only thing is well it's gonna push you
04:21 into the ground like a nail gravity's
04:24 gravity's gravity its ether abased
04:27 if they push not a pull so the mass of
04:30 the [ __ ] moon it does affect the
04:34 negative ether all pressures between
04:37 objects but I assure you you don't float
04:40 and even if you want to buy that bunch
04:42 of horseshit we run the footage 2x on
04:45 the moon of the astronauts from 69 to 72
04:49 and it's real time got a [ __ ] flag
04:52 flopping in the wind I didn't even put
04:54 that in the show that's a smoking gun
04:57 it is a smoking gun but you have too
05:00 many people that
05:01 they just don't grasp but oh they they
05:03 by the debunking crap but that's not
05:06 what this episodes about this episode is
05:09 about the fact that I think that they
05:13 have turned the entire moon hoax as it
05:16 relates to Rovers because it's like got
05:18 less risk factors into a turnkey
05:20 solution for countries that are budding
05:23 and trying to well it's it's essentially
05:26 something you offer and again it's not
05:28 all horrible if you make your people
05:31 feel comfortable and feel pride for
05:33 themselves there's benefit to that and I
05:35 understand that I'm kind of being little
05:39 flip 'add today 6 o'clock in the morning
05:42 can you expect I got up yesterday doing
05:46 a little sleep reset but these leaders
05:49 look good when [ __ ] happens on their
05:51 watch right well we got to the moon on
05:52 under so-and-so's watch they're better
05:56 now Nixon had a lot of image problems
06:00 when he came in one he had to take care
06:03 of the Vietnam War two he differed
06:07 greatly and he was also very I mean it
06:10 was really crazy LBJ is notorious for
06:16 being a bastard to his whole staff and
06:19 everything and you know if he was doing
06:21 the right thing and he was just like a
06:23 gun-toting cowboy you know I could
06:26 probably look back and go okay that's
06:27 cool he's like a Clint Eastwood or or
06:31 John Wayne kind of character but he's
06:34 getting [ __ ] done he's being moral and
06:35 he's not starting wars with fake gulf of
06:37 tonkin [ __ ] he's not murdering his
06:40 [ __ ] president so he can get a fake
06:42 swearing-in on a plane and feel special
06:44 now this guy took dumps in front of his
06:47 staff he had his mistress's maids
06:52 murdered he his estate killed his son
06:54 when his son came after his inheritance
06:57 his bastard son there's out-of-wedlock
07:00 son I hate using bastard cuz this it's
07:02 just a dumb thing I don't know whiting
07:04 one gave a [ __ ] whether or not that
07:07 whole family configuration occurred if
07:09 you exist you win screw all this [ __ ]
07:12 above your head
07:13 you're a mistake you're intended to just
07:15 forget all that [ __ ] whether you're
07:16 adopted or not adopted you exist you won
07:19 except for that one guy trying to sue
07:21 his parents for his existence Wow
07:25 it's just an awesome little sociological
07:27 experiment right no I didn't choose to
07:29 be created so I'm suing you okay so what
07:34 can I possibly give you your whole life
07:36 and all of your upkeep until you get to
07:37 18 I guess I already gave you that case
07:40 closed bunk but what I think is going on
07:44 is that like Nixon who wanted to make
07:48 sure that the moon thing happened on his
07:50 watch to repair his image and again the
07:53 conscious of his drawing was that he was
07:55 also like a pain in the ass you know
07:58 very complex man you kind of wanna think
08:01 he's a good guy and then you look up his
08:03 running mate
08:04 I believe in 72 and he had him shot in
08:06 the gut after a speech what was those it
08:10 was like [ __ ] Wild West like Dodge
08:12 City in the 60s and early 70s you're
08:15 gonna run against me I'm gonna have you
08:16 shot screw you pal okay so these um
08:23 these Rovers what blows me away
08:28 wanted they get any press at all these
08:31 Rovers I mean they accomplish nothing
08:35 right they drive around and they take
08:38 pictures oh they might grab a rock and
08:42 start sawing it in half and also the
08:44 crowd it's all fake people so I'm not
08:46 referencing anything that's really
08:47 occurring but even if you buy the
08:50 [ __ ] how do you know the ones on
08:53 Mars are fake well the fact that they
08:56 last as long as they did that's the
08:57 number one thing too
08:59 JPL has commissioned Hollywood's
09:02 greatest minds to create 3d terrain
09:05 software from 1982 to 1993 actually
09:09 started in 1995 excuse me
09:12 products like Terrigen exists you can
09:14 absolutely create these worlds they've
09:16 been taking photographs of Iceland and
09:18 Greenland and then passing them off as
09:20 Mars pictures people in those regions
09:24 are like that's my backyard what the
09:26 [ __ ] is this Oh
09:27 they go out there and NASA's there
09:29 they're there with big weird you know
09:32 new Rovers simulating all this crap but
09:36 I think most of it now to make sure that
09:38 there's no problem is all inside the
09:40 computer I would do that [ __ ] I wouldn't
09:42 take a picture anything out there they
09:44 give us a picture of Pluto and it's a
09:46 big [ __ ] joke Pluto's face from the
09:48 Disney franchise is on the surface of
09:50 Pluto one of the Mars photographs came
09:53 back and it looked like Bigfoot was
09:56 walking on Mars and I just have to
10:00 believe it's somebody in NASA laughs and
10:02 their ass off it's not the spitting
10:05 image but it's pretty damn close of the
10:06 one that walked across the riverbed way
10:09 back in the 60s like 67 or something
10:11 like that they're playing us they're
10:15 playing us and they know we're already
10:17 stupid enough that the masses want to
10:19 believe it [ __ ] so they do believe it
10:21 ship and get these doof balls coming
10:22 into conversations we got like three of
10:26 them lately it's it's a total SIOP of I
10:29 don't know it's like tight buttholes or
10:33 whatever it is but they they come in
10:36 they tell tell me how stupid I am or
10:38 whatever and I go look I'm not gonna say
10:41 you're in tolerate your [ __ ] just
10:42 coming here and saying and then
10:43 everyone's [ __ ] stupid who believes
10:45 this here's your forum posts don't cost
10:48 anything and my god you can post [ __ ]
10:51 chapters and information get your lazy
10:54 ass out there and prove us wrong take on
10:56 the issues in the video link us to the
10:58 time codes of which you're addressing
11:00 and then in absolutely unified fashion
11:06 they have never failed ever ever ever to
11:09 do this they go we'll telling you how it
11:16 works would just be a waste of my time
11:18 all right see you later buddy see you
11:21 later report spam block user see you
11:25 later you have no value to society by
11:29 chill but the Rovers on Mars never went
11:32 anywhere interesting a big crater that's
11:36 about it a volcanic eruption if anything
11:39 but they don't drive them towards the
11:42 pyramids they don't drive them towards a
11:44 gigantic you know severed belly in the
11:47 center they don't try things are there
11:51 about 15 plus years and you don't drive
11:53 anywhere [ __ ] interesting and you
11:56 don't land anywhere interesting
11:58 supposedly there's a face on the moon
12:00 you know IRA face on Mars and of course
12:02 that you've lit it differently now so it
12:03 doesn't look like one but get your ass
12:04 over there because there's a bunch of
12:05 pyramid [ __ ] there's a there's a
12:07 mountain over there supposedly 15 miles
12:09 high where's the good [ __ ] what are we
12:13 paying for you guys are boring your
12:16 imaginations are zero and they don't
12:20 dare fake it
12:20 it'd be like faking Devil's Tower
12:24 if you see it on a blip on a telescope
12:28 picture well faking it in 3d straight
12:31 ahead you can open yourself up for
12:33 massive liability so they're always
12:34 trying to reduce the risk of future
12:37 exposure just in case God comes down our
12:41 [ __ ] monolith comes down and teaches
12:42 NASA how to actually do their job 60
12:45 million dollars a day people sixty
12:49 million dollars a day hmm that's a
12:53 pretty good money wouldn't you say why
12:55 doesn't a support a rover on the moon we
12:59 know why we know why public doesn't know
13:01 why because we'd want them to put it
13:04 next to one of our previous missions
13:07 drive your ass over there show us how
13:10 the flags doing flapping in the wind
13:12 show us the lunar lander show us all the
13:15 footsteps show us the buggies that are
13:17 there show us how the landscape matches
13:21 all your time life photographs that you
13:23 took so perfectly won't do that will
13:26 they because they can't NASA has
13:28 absolutely blown it by taking pictures
13:30 of these suppose it and they haven't
13:33 they faked pictures of the limbs feet at
13:37 4x the scale of what they were whoops I
13:42 mean it is it is unbelievable how easy
13:46 it is to prove that these people are
13:48 lying to us on a daily basis China's
13:51 first Rover operated for two days
13:53 I think it was actually a little less
13:56 than two days the pictures looked like
14:01 brown soil from the earth with ice on it
14:04 now China's of gigantic country they
14:07 obviously found some area and there's a
14:09 lot of Google map videos out there where
14:11 China is doing massive landscaping to do
14:14 something I mean they're building huge
14:16 HAARP antennas big things but they're
14:19 not in areas where they're gonna build
14:21 cities these well they're one of their
14:23 what thirty five gigantic ghost cities
14:28 so maybe they were terraforming
14:30 something to be a pretend moon I don't
14:32 know but then they go back it's a little
14:35 bit better for a little while and you
14:38 know honestly I'm actually under
14:39 estimating and I have to apologize here
14:41 I'm under estimating how simple it is to
14:44 do this they don't need any help from
14:46 NASA JPL Rover my camera and some some
14:52 dirt out back and you just got to be
14:54 able to put a rocket in the sky and make
14:57 sure it disappears out of sight out of
14:58 mind and then you can roll footage with
15:00 that wherever you want consequently it's
15:02 interesting I didn't really see a
15:04 tremendous amount of animations from
15:07 from the Chinese space program as to how
15:10 exactly their system works is probably
15:12 out there but you know when NASA does it
15:14 or JPL when they hit Mars inside their
15:20 imaginations they have all this footage
15:23 of how it works and everybody thinks
15:25 that they're seeing live footage of this
15:27 [ __ ] [ __ ] it's hilarious baby boomers
15:32 on average and we've got some really
15:33 cool ones show up recently and man hats
15:35 off to these folks but the average one
15:38 and I don't blame baby boomers for this
15:41 they have no [ __ ] concept of how 3d
15:43 software works how rendering engines
15:45 work what's the difference between ray
15:47 casting and ray tracing they have no
15:51 idea that works
15:52 I don't know particle system is a
15:54 plug-in they don't know the difference
15:56 between my light wave and blender 3d
16:00 Houdini and ZBrush so they think they're
16:04 seeing reality
16:06 evanka
16:07 Trump I mean the new latest hoax of JPL
16:11 and I think that chick is great by the
16:14 way I think she'll be President one day
16:16 she put on a Twitter account that
16:18 animation that big-ass rover that went
16:20 down there last last time here just last
16:22 year well when she does it people trust
16:25 her and they see it and they think it's
16:26 real now the young people don't think
16:28 it's real they know it's CG and I don't
16:31 really know you know think about how
16:33 long it takes to investigate anything
16:36 that's a crime in this country
16:38 Trump's getting chased every day for
16:42 everything he's ever done every dumpees
16:44 ever taking every piss he's ever taken
16:46 Adam shifts in there yeah got my yellow
16:50 towel but you got Hillary Clinton a
16:53 complete [ __ ] traitor
16:56 we have people who have committed
16:59 pedophile murders that are involved with
17:02 her campaign there are still free people
17:06 and it's like yeah well you know they're
17:09 just at that level where they can't go
17:10 down unreal unreal so what if everybody
17:15 did just jump up one day and say enough
17:19 is enough you can't prove you're there
17:23 we can't go into your facility and raid
17:25 your computers and figure out what's
17:27 going on I mean it'd be cool to know
17:30 like a what is it project Veritas and go
17:34 inside JPL and NASA get really deep but
17:39 you know it's not easy they can't do
17:41 their little techniques to get in those
17:43 organizations because those
17:44 organizations are as deep as it goes I
17:47 mean you know you ever wonder how far
17:49 you could go in the universe before you
17:51 hit a black wall a little door knob on
17:53 it getting into JPL or NASA and getting
17:57 into these the fake compartments they
18:01 create this fake content whether it be
18:04 the live action shots they take and feed
18:06 to us or the CG shots they feed to take
18:08 those so the engineering and software
18:09 that's generated to keep this hoax going
18:12 once you're in that compartment you're
18:14 at the edge of top secret secret [ __ ] in
18:18 this country
18:20 I mean I imagine the the matinee showing
18:22 at lunchtime is probably yeah this is
18:25 how we did 9/11 it's how we wired the
18:27 building since I would kill Kennedy
18:29 this is agenda21 episode Oh season 2
18:33 episode 24 israel's got a problem
18:37 because netanyahu is being investigated
18:39 the president of that country is in big
18:41 trouble i don't follow it that much but
18:44 it seems pretty serious for that guy so
18:46 now foof look over here look over here
18:49 were sending [ __ ] into space headed for
18:53 the moon takes this little fortune
18:56 cookie shot back of Earth I'm not going
18:59 to do it but someone needs to find the
19:00 shot the day it was taking the time what
19:03 was taken grab all the satellite footage
19:06 of the weather systems of the area of
19:09 the world that they are taking a picture
19:10 of compare them make sure they're
19:13 correct
19:14 nothing accounts for the fact that the
19:16 Milky Way isn't in the shot some stars
19:20 in the shot but what if everyone said
19:23 this has got to stop how long would it
19:25 take someone has to champion the in this
19:30 country should be a class-action lawsuit
19:34 maybe a hundred million people adults
19:37 with minds that work say we need to see
19:42 proof that you're there you need to
19:45 provide proof which means you're gonna
19:46 have to redo your entire protocol of
19:48 launching a rocket and taking it to
19:50 where you're going like I've said
19:51 several times in several episodes the
19:53 camera can never turn off we want to see
19:56 the whole journey and there's got to be
19:58 10 ways to Sunday or we can confirm this
20:01 maybe send additional Crockett's and the
20:03 all film each other the whole mission
20:06 the whole missions designed the boosters
20:07 the software everything gets inspected
20:09 like an open-source project the proof
20:13 that this isn't a big lie stealing
20:15 billions and billions annually out of
20:19 this country because we got things we
20:22 need to do with that money
20:23 and space travel is probably one of the
20:25 things we need to do but not with a
20:28 preexisting organization founded by
20:29 Nazis it just happened
20:33 you helped us out with ICBMs I do want
20:37 to add some data to something that I had
20:40 said earlier in different episodes about
20:42 ICBMs and the fact that I think that
20:43 NASA contributed to the overall
20:46 development of that technology
20:48 there were intercontinental ballistic
20:50 missiles I believe in the mid-50s likes
20:52 fifty six or something like that was
20:54 with a technically the first giant
20:57 missile successfully took a warhead
21:00 intercontinental but by the mid 70s
21:04 these things were inside submarines
21:07 which makes them insanely dangerous do I
21:11 think there will ever ever ever be a
21:13 nuclear war know if there ever was a
21:18 nuclear war is being started by
21:19 literally someone like dr. evil and we
21:23 need to calm down if it occurs and just
21:27 clean up and survive and then go get
21:30 these people but I don't think it's
21:32 gonna occur I think if it were a plan
21:36 you know you could get you could get
21:38 probably some crazy Elite em efforts to
21:42 you know I'm 85 years old well yeah well
21:46 as a Prince Phillip right he said he
21:47 killed the whole [ __ ] world such a
21:49 nice guy
21:50 Tomek as a virus and exterminate mankind
21:53 Prince Phillip of Windsor said that man
21:57 unreal so you get a bunch of guys like
22:00 that and he's self-loathing dudes yeah
22:04 maybe some guys gonna want to push the
22:05 button but there's plenty of them plenty
22:07 of people underneath those people that I
22:09 think would get wind of such a thing and
22:11 they would sabotage it and then of
22:14 course there's those of you who still
22:16 believe that they don't exist and I
22:19 don't know doing more research on bikini
22:23 island I think that there is some pretty
22:27 big evidence that some serious crap does
22:29 exist whether or not they can transport
22:34 that much TNT into the ocean and have
22:38 this gigantic conversion of lithium you
22:42 know take it from what was supposed to
22:43 be about 10 to 15 megatons up to about a
22:46 forty Megaton bomb
22:47 and nearly kill everybody in the work
22:48 station that doesn't sound like a
22:50 problem that TNT is gonna have TNT is
22:52 never gonna have a problem it's just
22:54 gonna simply convert and then it's gonna
22:56 have a big explosion I don't know you
22:59 know what the volumetric requirements
23:01 are to simulate bikini island explosions
23:04 where you have that gigantic explosion
23:07 and and Russia's done the biggest one
23:09 ever right and again as long as you're
23:12 doing it on land you have no problem but
23:14 dropping this from the sky and having an
23:15 air burst if you fill the biggest jet in
23:19 the world the whole fuselage with TNT
23:22 and - you could get it off the ground
23:23 and you start to plummet it down and
23:26 then you do a detonation one you can see
23:29 a plane falling out of the sky you can't
23:31 because they're gigantic buildings with
23:34 [ __ ] wings right a friend of mine
23:37 told me a interesting fact the other day
23:39 he pulled up a picture of the new 787
23:41 with the big beautiful swept-back wings
23:44 look amazing he pointed at the engine he
23:47 said you see that engine right there he
23:49 goes that engine has a diameter the same
23:53 as a 737 s fuselage that's how big that
23:57 engine is that blows the mine so for me
24:01 I think that for now nukes are real
24:05 completely real and everyone gets all
24:07 upset if I give any frangie theory equal
24:11 representation in the show and I think
24:15 that's crazy it's like being prejudiced
24:17 against people because of their color
24:18 hey they have a belief they're not
24:21 hurting me if you believe in nuclear
24:23 weapons don't exist i hurtin me no if
24:25 you believe the world is flat is that
24:27 hurting me no you're not you're not Pol
24:29 Pot coming around killing people with
24:31 glasses because you fear they're
24:33 intelligent so what I want to do in this
24:35 episode is take it a little bit further
24:37 than the basic notion that either
24:40 there's a copycat program going on or
24:43 our folks are selling it to control the
24:45 people look we'll give this to you and
24:47 will help you orchestrate the whole
24:48 thing but you know it's our stuff so
24:53 don't mess around we've been doing this
24:54 a lot longer than you have and if you do
24:56 it by yourself you're gonna make some
24:57 mistakes now China's second Rover
25:00 to the moon came back with more [ __ ]
25:03 brown soil photographs I mean it's it's
25:05 like I'm waiting for a tumbleweed and a
25:07 rapid to go by on these [ __ ] shots
25:09 it's unbelievable but then within 24
25:11 hours or shots were color corrected to
25:14 match the moon being all grey like some
25:18 made a phone call the [ __ ] you guys
25:20 doing get your [ __ ] together just bad
25:24 planning bad planning right now all of
25:28 you on this show are hip the not the
25:30 normal listeners you're all hip to the
25:32 fact that they are definitely between
25:34 twenty nineteen and twenty thirty nine
25:36 twenty years from now unless again we're
25:39 victorious with the Great Awakening and
25:41 these people have really painful tight
25:44 handcuffs put on them they're going to
25:47 attempt a hoax landing on Mars they are
25:52 not going to try to go to the moon
25:53 between now and then although again you
25:58 know what they do and you guys got to be
26:00 vigilant about this and then when it in
26:03 that when it happens you need to note it
26:05 and pass it around to your friends it's
26:08 like this new Green Deal [ __ ] from
26:10 Cortes senator crazy or you know enough
26:14 senator but the house representative
26:15 nutbag that's the greatest thing that
26:18 could have ever happened to America at
26:20 least the Republican party is to have
26:21 Cortes out there pushing [ __ ] lunacy
26:25 a hundred trillion dollar program
26:27 getting rid of cars and planes and cows
26:31 and all those other stuff I mean it's
26:32 beautiful so you get that stuff and you
26:36 pass it around to make sure everyone
26:37 understands these super duper late term
26:40 abortions I'm telling you man if there's
26:43 a hell if there's any massive punishment
26:45 after this life every single [ __ ] on
26:48 planet Earth that wants to kill a kid at
26:50 nine months there's your line over there
26:54 I thought the Holocaust was bad that's
26:57 gonna make it seem like Disneyland on
27:00 the best day with Walt walking around
27:02 with you cuz what's over there is going
27:06 to be horrid for you but what happens is
27:09 this the the newspapers and the
27:12 magazines and all the television
27:14 and the internet stuff are pumping these
27:15 articles that say that man is gonna
27:18 return back to the moon soon how many of
27:22 you remember Elon Musk saying in 2016
27:26 he's gonna put a dude on Mars in 2018 I
27:29 remember that and we sit there and laugh
27:34 but here's what's happening to the psych
27:36 psychology of people who still believe
27:39 all this [ __ ] they hear that and
27:44 they go oh everything's great
27:47 pat themselves on the back aren't we
27:49 great now when it never happens and I
27:52 mean ever happens it's never attempted
27:54 there's no program greenlit there's no
27:56 technology developed to do any of this
27:58 stuff the platforms aren't renewed
28:00 there's no astronauts trained for it it
28:02 just is a bunch of [ __ ] like a bad
28:05 [ __ ] fake news website with some
28:07 bloggers out there making [ __ ] up they
28:10 feel great then they don't audit
28:12 anything and then they come to our
28:14 channel and try to lecture us by the way
28:16 I wanted to tell you guys it's gonna be
28:18 a little bit of a variety show at the
28:19 same time here you know that when I post
28:22 an episode that says the word moon and
28:24 the word hoax they put the the
28:30 cyclopædia Britannica link below my
28:32 video to propagandize your brain so that
28:37 you believe the fake [ __ ] at the
28:40 Encyclopedia Britannica the funny thing
28:44 was I was going through some old videos
28:46 that I don't know why I was doing it but
28:50 I saw my reptilian episode do reptilian
28:55 aliens exist or something like that
28:56 reptilian aliens or whatever it was and
28:59 I noticed they put the Britannica link
29:01 underneath my reptilian episode and I
29:05 had this wild feeling I was like damn
29:08 maybe David Icke is right
29:10 why would they put some clarification
29:13 below a reptilian alien episode as if
29:17 they need to clarify that these things
29:19 don't exist because they don't exist
29:23 right it would be almost as Luke
29:27 have I said pedophile episode I have one
29:31 called elite pedophilia early pedophiles
29:35 or whatever it is and they of course D
29:37 monetize that and I understand that I I
29:39 concur with them no one wants to
29:41 advertise next to that [ __ ] but it would
29:44 be as if they post a link down below and
29:47 say well pedophiles don't exist
29:48 the elite doesn't exist then we know
29:52 they're lying well then another line
29:53 about the moon thing so what's up with
29:56 this reptilian thing I don't give it a
29:58 second thought I don't go throughout my
30:01 day thinking about routines but I just
30:04 thought that was really strange
30:06 in fact the episodes that they've
30:08 demonetized are so suspect my NPC
30:11 episode has been
30:12 demonetized my censorship one has been
30:15 demonetized my episode about fake
30:20 enemies fake enemies is that an upbeat
30:23 title there are no enemies
30:26 demonetized why because I said Russia
30:29 wasn't a bad country no worse than any
30:33 other place no worse than us
30:35 in relation to other people's
30:36 perspective of the United States of
30:38 America so one of the big patterns is
30:41 write an article completely full of
30:43 kraut sell tickets to the moon like I
30:45 said it's happened several times people
30:47 won tickets to the moon now I will say
30:49 one cool thing was that Omni magazine
30:53 had a contest for designing the best
30:56 Rover to be on the moon and then one
31:00 that ended up in there I think 93 it was
31:02 pretty much almost the exact same thing
31:04 except that had the energy package on it
31:07 that had the solar panels it's still
31:12 fake but at least it they took the idea
31:14 and said that's really smart
31:16 what's also interesting is that they
31:18 typically like in case of the rover 93
31:22 was super duper tiny and the one that
31:24 ended up there in 2003 for were much
31:29 larger and of course the recent ones
31:31 massive the interesting thing is is that
31:34 the terrain in which these machines
31:36 encounter are always directly
31:38 proportional to the capabilities of
31:40 these
31:41 if they're parking right on the perfect
31:43 spot was the one in oh three oh four the
31:46 first one that landed it was like the
31:48 Odyssey or whatever the hell it was it
31:52 landed inside of a crater which gave
31:54 them this nice sort of buffer of time
31:57 where it kind of was in the crater they
31:59 weren't sure it was gonna be able to get
32:00 up and it wasn't a gigantic crater it
32:03 was a small crater and so sure enough
32:05 you know it took some samples and then
32:07 it drove right out and no problem had
32:09 that thing been a real crater or you
32:12 know created by a volcanic eruption or
32:14 some electrical discharge of plasma from
32:15 the interior then you may be dealing
32:19 with one that's the size of New York
32:21 City that's you know a hundred times
32:25 bigger than the one in Arizona or
32:26 Diamond Head and you simply can't get
32:28 out because right there at the edge to
32:31 get out it's just simply too high and
32:32 then the rover's just stuck in purgatory
32:34 the whole time right I think we can
32:37 expect and we've already seen it because
32:39 other space stations exist with the same
32:42 exact problems again that one from China
32:44 the Chinese space station had all the
32:45 water bubbles that were super evident
32:48 all these particles going exactly in the
32:51 same direction the big bubble that went
32:54 up the dudes helmet and then flubbed
32:56 over his helmet and went up they're
32:58 copying they're making mistakes that's
33:00 good for us we get to see what's going
33:02 on
33:02 I saw another tour of another Space
33:05 Station I guess this is a SpaceX version
33:07 of the modules that were put up there no
33:11 one takes a camera points it at the moon
33:13 points it at the earth all one shot
33:17 smoking gun smoking gun smoking guns
33:20 what I'm interested to see and this next
33:24 half decade to decade is are the Space
33:27 Agency's synchronizing their efforts to
33:29 further validate through sheer pressure
33:32 of repetition of lies all their actions
33:37 well we're all going to go together
33:39 joint action China feels good Israel
33:41 feels good America feels good
33:43 Europe feels good maybe the Russians get
33:46 involved again I think it would be an
33:48 absolute kicker if Russia could get
33:51 their space program up again which I
33:54 don't think they have the money
33:55 do it just yet but get it going again
33:59 conquer those Van Allen belts conquer
34:02 radiation build a brand new you know Mir
34:06 2.0 or whatever a real beautiful space
34:09 station up there where you could walk
34:11 unleash a little bit of hidden
34:13 technology get to grab anti gravity
34:15 gravity plates all figured out and then
34:19 do what von Braun said you had to do
34:22 which is ferry fuel up to that point
34:24 build a ship that doesn't have anything
34:26 to do with being launched on earth up
34:28 there and then just cruise with a nice
34:31 radioactive protection layer around the
34:34 astronauts get them right to the moon
34:36 set that thing down right and the Sea of
34:39 Tranquility get out and go we don't see
34:44 anything here in fact this place doesn't
34:47 look anything like your place but you
34:50 took pictures of now I usually don't go
34:54 down this path I have a whole episode on
34:57 the moon a lot of folks came in on the
35:02 the moon hoax smoking guns episode and
35:05 they're towing the other theory which
35:06 has some points to it which is that
35:10 we've seen stars shine through the moon
35:14 and these aren't eruptions on the
35:16 surface of the plasma energy coming
35:18 through a little crater spot because it
35:20 moves with the cycle and again someone
35:23 could have SIOP these photographs I
35:26 haven't seen a continuous video shot
35:29 from some amateur oh it would actually
35:33 be a group of amateur astronomers kid
35:37 with us like we're sorry
35:38 astute or sorry a teacher with a bunch
35:40 of kids right they'll get theirs out
35:42 they all of their cameras hooked to it
35:43 but it's a shot where the star is first
35:47 in space it could be Venus I don't know
35:50 what this body is but then as the
35:52 crescent moon all the parts with the the
35:56 waning shadow as you know the stars
35:59 rotate in the background this star goes
36:01 right inside the belly of the Moon seems
36:07 a little strange four or five shots
36:08 it goes inside the belly of the Moon now
36:10 that's been presented on the internet
36:12 but I don't have proof that that's real
36:13 but there are a lot of people that think
36:15 well the moon is not what you think it
36:17 is it's just a projection there's all
36:20 those videos claiming you know to have
36:22 the moon flickering on and off a lot of
36:26 those are horrible home projects where
36:29 someone's figured out enough of After
36:31 Effects to be dangerous or other tools
36:34 similar to it we do have the weird you
36:40 know the pulsing waves these guys are
36:43 taken I forgot the damn name of it but
36:45 does seem to be something strange about
36:47 the light coming from the moon the
36:49 moonlight makes the thermometer
36:51 supposedly colder I haven't tested a
36:53 person but I've seen several videos of
36:55 people doubting that this is the case
36:57 and they take it out there and like oh
36:58 my god it is making you a colder put it
37:01 in the sunlight against warmer or I'm
37:04 sorry they put in shadows and it gets
37:06 warmer and they pull out in the
37:07 moonlight and it gets colder I don't
37:10 know what that is
37:10 maybe it's pushing I don't know space
37:13 atmosphere down but now what are we
37:16 trying to do with the earth right now
37:17 when it comes to tyranny globalism
37:21 socialism all these agenda21 or Jenna
37:25 2030 programs we see it coming all the
37:30 indicators are that these things are
37:32 very very will agencies exist I mean
37:35 there's no politicians that are elected
37:37 that are trying to push this crap
37:39 complete bold-faced lies and so we're
37:43 trying to stop them we're trying to wake
37:44 everybody up hey everybody ever wake up
37:46 wake up wake up see these Georgia
37:48 Guidestones big problem by the way I got
37:51 one of my numbers off by four percent in
37:54 a previous episode the Georgia
37:56 Guidestones say that we're supposed to
37:58 maintain world population under five
38:00 hundred million in perpetual balance
38:01 with nature I calculated that again
38:04 seventy seven point five billion people
38:06 and it's a ninety four percent reduction
38:09 in real population not ninety eight and
38:11 then if you do my theory which is
38:14 they're gonna start about 150 year at
38:16 ninety eight percent reduction with two
38:18 percent left over so I don't know how
38:21 someone feels super
38:22 well the guy was coming in mind it's you
38:24 know it's not 98-94 does that make you
38:27 feel better man like we'll find a 4% of
38:30 the [ __ ] world disappears is that
38:31 like whoo oh boy we're okay now just
38:36 reinforces this unbelievable it's like
38:38 the guy is more [ __ ] happy about
38:40 being right about a 4% swing and you
38:44 know shame on me for not doing my math
38:46 better on that but like focus focus nerd
38:49 focus 94% of the [ __ ] world
38:53 disappearing means you and your mommy
38:55 ain't gonna be around anymore you're not
38:57 in their [ __ ] Club
38:58 I guarantee it and I guarantee they're
39:01 not starting at the [ __ ] maximum
39:03 capacity of the restaurant they're gonna
39:05 start at a much reduced amount and
39:07 you're not in the last two percent
39:09 either doesn't matter how many times
39:11 you've installed windows you're of no
39:13 value to them so I think that if these
39:17 agencies were to collude with each other
39:19 and it's all a matter of
39:20 self-preservation I mean you get all
39:22 these heads of state together in some
39:23 boardroom with politicians with military
39:28 people potentially even the presidents
39:30 of respective countries and they're
39:33 sitting around looking at us like Jesus
39:36 men we are moments from getting our ass
39:39 handed to us the people you know the
39:42 snowball that's rolling downhill of of
39:44 every single person waking up in every
39:47 single conceivable area of deceit is
39:50 getting a lot bigger and a lot faster
39:53 the banking has been completely exposed
39:55 from their politicians military
39:59 corporations shills at the personal
40:02 level your ante for people they know
40:04 it's coming and the space program is
40:06 this thing off to the side it's like I'm
40:09 sure if they're sitting around talking
40:10 to each other they're saying something
40:12 to the effect of oh my god in that
40:14 [ __ ] thing over there you guys no
40:17 one's alive that did this right and how
40:19 do we dig our ass out of this problem
40:21 you can imagine like I always say let's
40:23 put ourselves in charge of cleaning up
40:25 the NASA lies I've addressed this once
40:27 before I think of my episode replacing
40:29 NASA but imagine you've got to stop the
40:32 hemorrhaging if every single point in
40:34 the elites program
40:36 the ruling class program that's being
40:40 exposed as a wound that's just starting
40:42 to us like an artery spitting out blood
40:44 every time the heart pumps they have to
40:47 try and convince everyone that none of
40:49 this is occurring and it's like that old
40:52 story the Dutch boys put his fingers in
40:54 the dams and everytime puts his finger
40:55 in two other holes pop up and so he puts
40:58 you know its foot in one and it's
41:00 fingering it and then for a pop up and
41:02 it's just getting worse and worse for
41:03 them it's a landslide of a problem now I
41:07 will say in the back of my brain and
41:09 this is a little bit off-topic but in
41:10 the back of my brain the I think they're
41:12 really at some point if we don't get
41:15 some real human beings that really care
41:19 about society in charge someone is gonna
41:23 pull that 99% virus I watched some I
41:29 watched an interesting video about this
41:31 has been going on for you know a lot
41:32 longer than recently but this fungus
41:34 that gets on top of insects especially
41:36 ants and the fungus digs down inside
41:39 their body and then start spawning from
41:42 inside their body it's a plant
41:43 you know these ants are just sort of
41:45 frozen on a plant now this unicorn pops
41:48 out of their head because it's like
41:49 digging into their protein and and using
41:52 their body as this you know sort of
41:55 compost of Health I thought Jesus man
41:58 could you imagine that in the last six
42:01 months from right now I probably know of
42:06 at least half a dozen people within a
42:09 degree of me obviously within two
42:11 degrees of me excuse me who have been
42:14 notified that they had cancer and died
42:18 within two weeks within one to two weeks
42:20 they just absolutely died one dude died
42:22 in three days he just came home
42:25 we've got wife kids he's got a little
42:28 bit of a headache he's dead in two days
42:30 another person just happened just this
42:33 last week she goes in she's totally fine
42:37 she goes in the hospital boom she's dead
42:39 within a two-week period cancer I don't
42:43 remember this should happen and two
42:44 years ago and I remember this stuff
42:46 happening when I was a kid now does that
42:48 happen all the time around the world
42:49 yeah sure but a lot of times in one
42:52 place that's just a little bit weird
42:54 maybe it's just a frequency when you
42:55 know you learn a word you hear the word
42:56 maybe I'm just hearing it a lot now but
43:00 usually your friends will tell you
43:01 another friend friend of mine just had
43:04 this happened to her friend wasn't that
43:06 old so could you imagine we have been
43:08 sold this this bill of goods and and
43:11 what I'm reason why mentioning this is
43:13 the whole idea of them digging
43:14 themselves out of their lies and of
43:16 course the space program is just one of
43:17 the smaller ones that they've got going
43:19 but imagine we're sold this zombie
43:22 apocalypse that in one day
43:24 you know people turn up with bath salts
43:27 syndrome and then they start biting each
43:29 other and it's something some virus the
43:31 CDC can't stop it won't stop and not
43:33 supposed to stop it and it should start
43:35 spreading and we all go crazy and bunch
43:38 of people are immune from whatever it is
43:40 you don't get bit whatever all the
43:43 Walking Dead stuff but we're sold this
43:45 very flash in the pants issue where it
43:49 happens really quickly and but the way
43:51 it's really going to occur is that a ton
43:54 of people who are on the fringe of their
43:58 health because they eat fast food they
44:00 lots of GMO their brush with [ __ ]
44:02 flora they use aluminum under you know
44:05 antiperspirant they have all these
44:08 issues and they're their first ones out
44:11 and a big giant wave of people just died
44:14 but because you do these computer
44:17 simulations of when the mind starts to
44:19 communicate about a epidemic a possible
44:23 epidemic we have the press black it out
44:26 you have the hospital's black it out and
44:27 the only thing that's happening is as
44:29 long as it doesn't spread too quickly a
44:33 bunch of people are dead before anyone
44:36 says anything and they're like really
44:37 someone here found what's where didn't
44:39 you have on your family and my friend
44:40 just died
44:41 and you start piecing it together and
44:43 going maybe there's a [ __ ] epidemic
44:44 could you imagine there's an epidemic of
44:46 death and because everyone's sucking the
44:49 tit of fake news which is all news all
44:53 [ __ ] news is fake news we are the news
44:57 as QED said we're the best we have and
44:59 because we could be infiltrated easily
45:01 by shells
45:03 what the hell can we trust right yet you
45:06 know what's funny
45:07 Q's been saying this for a little while
45:09 we are the news or you are the news
45:11 right the one thing that's awesome about
45:14 cigar lounges there's a lot of places
45:17 like this but cigar lounges bring
45:19 together some pretty great independent
45:21 minds especially if you smoke about two
45:22 o'clock in the afternoon well if
45:24 someone's getting off at two o'clock
45:25 they're usually they're entrepreneurs
45:27 the smartest people in the world that
45:30 have been able to avoid being slaves
45:32 they run their own businesses and they
45:35 come in and they sit down and we share
45:36 what we experience in life and it's like
45:39 a little journalistic outlet for us to
45:43 stay on track but we all know how the
45:47 world works I will eventually make an
45:49 episode before the season's over on
45:51 groupthink there are thousands of you
45:57 that are member of this channel and I
46:00 know that of the devout people that are
46:03 attracted to the truth you would never
46:07 suffer from the Inquisition's I mean you
46:11 might admit you like something just to
46:13 get people not to kill you and so FEMA
46:15 camps on right which isn't gonna happen
46:16 in this country anytime soon but way
46:19 before there's a Fema camp with ovens
46:22 and weird turnstiles and prison bars and
46:27 ABCD lines and that kind of [ __ ] way
46:29 before that we have a group think mob
46:32 rules mentality with a lot of these
46:35 things and what's really funny and
46:37 actually I think it's really good news
46:38 is that we know that BOTS
46:41 drop off information into our channels
46:45 we know that paid shills come in and
46:49 drop off stuff in the channels and we
46:51 know poor souls that still believe these
46:54 lies stop by and drop off stuff in our
46:57 channel but we also know that these PR
47:01 firms work inside the press they work in
47:05 producing all these articles I mean
47:07 what's really interesting is there's all
47:10 these disgusting [ __ ] websites out
47:12 there and if you want to know whether
47:14 you have fake news or real news
47:16 here's how you do it you go to your
47:18 favorite quote unquote news site and you
47:22 scroll all the way to the bottom of an
47:23 article maybe even the front page of the
47:25 website and if you see a bunch of little
47:28 icons at the bottom linking out to these
47:30 websites that have these galleries that
47:33 say you wouldn't believe what honey
47:40 booboo child's mother looks like now you
47:43 wouldn't believe the little Russian kid
47:45 that was a big bodybuilder at seven what
47:47 he looks like now you would you wouldn't
47:51 you wouldn't and it's all these you know
47:53 ten things you didn't know about the
47:55 series mash on TV and you link out to
47:58 these ridiculous [ __ ] websites they
48:00 take you through these absolutely
48:03 propaganda infested ad infested websites
48:06 where you just hit next next next
48:09 you know everybody's looked at these
48:11 galleries I've looked at them that is
48:13 where you know that they are taking
48:16 money from these crazy-ass places has no
48:20 [ __ ] place on earth where it should
48:24 be right next to what is called reality
48:26 which should be called the news news
48:29 should not be this speculative thing or
48:31 this sensationalized thing news should
48:34 be unbiased should be objective it
48:37 shouldn't have opinion pieces everywhere
48:39 you want to go to opinion piece website
48:41 go make out an opinion piece website and
48:43 it's like these are the opinions of the
48:45 people who are here but a newspaper
48:48 running an opinion column is starting to
48:51 cross that Rubicon of yellow journalism
48:54 because as long as someone is either
48:56 influential through their own
48:58 personality or through articulation
49:01 people are gonna believe it people are
49:04 gonna be swayed one way or the other
49:06 that's not the job of news is it news is
49:09 hey some shits happen in the Middle East
49:12 this is exactly what we know at this
49:14 point this is the person who was at XYZ
49:17 coordinates on the world and there's
49:20 what time they were this is what they
49:23 saw here's a video of what they took off
49:25 their cell phone unedited it's a big-ass
49:27 boring broth footage but now you can
49:29 make up your own mind
49:30 note they take a Trump speech they cut
49:33 it all out of context and say the guy's
49:34 saying [ __ ] he doesn't say and then dip
49:36 shits believe it and pass it all over
49:38 their [ __ ] Facebook page sorry
49:40 that ain't the news that is a subjective
49:43 manipulative brainwashing technique of
49:46 swaying opinion for an agenda to serve
49:49 the ruling class so they stay in power
49:52 so tyranny [ __ ] takes over the world
49:55 and they can get whatever they want and
49:57 on that platform of knowledge comes the
50:01 consensus of us 4 or 5 space programs
50:04 that need to keep their paychecks and to
50:06 keep their budgets ever bigger ever
50:08 bigger every single year so I don't
50:11 usually stress the thing I'm about to
50:16 stress here and I'm probably not the
50:18 best source to point people at for this
50:20 kind of thing in fact I know I'm not the
50:23 best source for this sort of thing I'm
50:26 probably really good at maybe helping
50:28 someone get a job figuring out how to
50:30 express themselves becoming an artist or
50:32 whatever that's probably what I'm best
50:34 suited for for any one of your random
50:36 family and family members be careful
50:39 with my opinions about religion because
50:40 that's going to rub people wrong for
50:42 sure and might want to tell him he
50:44 swears a little bit but you know just go
50:46 with it
50:47 there don't sit on that video but here's
50:49 what I think is extremely important
50:51 about where we are right now and
50:52 especially with things like fake space
50:54 programs we need to get people on board
50:57 to the lies and I know this is the truth
51:01 movement I'm kind of saying something
51:03 fairly you know unoriginal but I don't
51:08 know if we and and all of us have tried
51:10 to wake up a family member a friend and
51:12 we had resistance and then again they'll
51:15 say well you think everything is a
51:16 conspiracy
51:17 bla bla bla bla so maybe pics from
51:20 smoking guns out there in the world
51:22 where it's something that that person's
51:24 concerned with because everyone's got
51:26 threads sticking out of their sweaters
51:28 everybody does they got the GMO thread
51:31 sticking out so they don't they think we
51:32 went to the moon but they know that
51:33 glyphosate it's really bad to ingest
51:35 they figured out that fluoride is bad
51:38 for them so they get that little one
51:39 they don't want acidic water I
51:44 found out that smart water is very
51:45 acidic so now I've gone to lava water
51:48 made out of made from Iceland made in
51:51 Iceland from their glaciers 8.88 pH 0
51:57 fluoride since it right on the bottle
52:00 it's beautiful Thank You Iceland
52:03 seriously thank you thank you thank you
52:05 we need to protect that company by their
52:09 products Fiji water pretty good pH
52:13 balance has some of the highest
52:16 fluoridation rates in the world
52:18 point three on average it swings but the
52:22 you know it's they don't play any games
52:25 with that crap but we have got to get
52:28 people awake before they make their
52:30 moves we need to move faster than they
52:32 move luckily there are other websites
52:38 you know I did get accepted into
52:42 Brighton which is cool or bright to yon
52:45 however they're calling it I'm on a
52:49 [ __ ] shoot they've had a limit of an
52:52 hour
52:53 I just watched some content for mark
52:56 dice on their two-hour video so I put up
52:59 the new season 1 content up there to see
53:02 if it will encode properly but again I'm
53:05 not the best for probably waking up your
53:08 family unless you got like well I mean
53:10 what's interesting is I think all in all
53:12 reality you will have sort of the really
53:15 clean folks that won't they won't even
53:17 say hell on a video I [ __ ] hate it
53:19 when someone goes AG double hockey
53:21 sticks as I really
53:23 you don't say hell on a [ __ ] video
53:25 are you kidding me oh my god ok but
53:29 that's good for your grandmother good
53:30 for your mom someone's trying to [ __ ]
53:32 virtue single signal to the world about
53:34 how awesome they are fine push that crap
53:36 on them great if it works turn them on
53:39 zeitgeist is a great movie sort of
53:43 accessible to everyone
53:44 a little hardcore but just because the
53:47 subject matters hardcore I'm good for
53:49 your uncle your dad your brother people
53:52 who are a little bit more alpha maybe
53:56 we had a listener come in I think she
53:58 does ones before summer one of my
54:00 episodes I was mentioning alpha males
54:02 alpha males and he goes well you know
54:04 people who say their alpha male a lot or
54:07 not alpha males I'm just like okay okay
54:12 dude whatever it's an issue today
54:16 because works going extinct in this
54:19 planet you know so it's not actually
54:21 happening in America anymore Europe oh
54:23 my god
54:24 what guy isn't dressed like a girl over
54:27 there and if you're not breed would you
54:31 you know raise your kids outside of this
54:33 this gender confusion zone that's over
54:38 there in Europe man wolf kills me guys
54:42 have some of the best genes in the world
54:44 over there and I just hate to see it all
54:45 flip-floppy around everyone gets all
54:47 upset and doesn't make kids because they
54:49 don't know how to put a ninny in an Audi
54:51 or an Audi in any earth gosh I went back
54:54 and I'm I I guess I'll just announce it
54:59 here this is kind of a silly place to do
55:01 it but it kind of folds into what we're
55:02 talking about here season one is sort of
55:05 like all over the place because I was
55:07 trying to figure it out by about is
55:08 about episode 25 or so which I believe
55:12 is the moon hoax one that's where I it's
55:16 26 I think 26 on 165 get those mixed up
55:19 but that's where I kind of forgot my
55:21 editing down I figured out what's going
55:23 on but I was using all this music out of
55:24 my computer and then of course music
55:27 companies you know wanna claim that if
55:31 you use 15 seconds of their music they
55:33 own your whole [ __ ] thing it's like
55:34 seriously anyway I'm reading all of
55:38 season 1 episodes so that there's no I
55:41 mean is the first I think 20 episodes
55:43 weren't edited well so there's lot of
55:46 gaps and me smoking and clothes
55:49 throat-clearing and and so and they're
55:52 demonetized they're also forbidden to be
55:55 seen in Europe because the music
55:57 companies can't get along with Germany
55:59 so all that's gonna be cleaned up
56:01 there's a there's a brand new channel
56:02 out there called deep thoughts radio
56:04 season 1 you'll find links all over the
56:07 place once I get it completely finished
56:09 I'm going to swap
56:10 all the videos you see on the website
56:12 feed over to this new channel and I'll
56:15 put a link at the top but I've cleaned
56:17 the whole thing up I would put them on
56:19 the normal channel but the problem is is
56:22 that's going to confuse the chronology
56:23 of everything so the numbers are going
56:25 up I don't want you to see you know 350
56:28 and then you're gonna see a hundred
56:29 videos that you've already seen
56:31 just with the cleaned up intro and some
56:34 editing in the in the center of it but
56:37 what I noticed and looking back of
56:39 course I didn't know quite how to frame
56:41 the episode and know what rules I wanted
56:44 to abide by I definitely kept my mouth
56:46 shut when it came to cussing and cursing
56:49 and just being myself so I was being
56:51 really really careful with this show and
56:54 I sort of had this I want everyone in
56:56 the world to see the show
56:57 and I started realized you know that
56:59 that I'm just not that guy I don't want
57:03 to lie about Who I am and pretend to be
57:05 you know the professor at the college
57:07 he's not gonna use an f-bomb but the
57:08 students which I don't this stuff that
57:11 we talk about it's frustrating isn't it
57:14 and so the idea is if I sit here and
57:17 hide all my frustration then you get
57:19 more frustrated I've seen it happen it
57:22 happens to me all the time when I see
57:24 all the key went on analysis when Donald
57:28 Trump he was just did a speech somewhere
57:30 and he talked about wanting to use a
57:32 dirty word he ended up using the word
57:36 [ __ ] so far I haven't seen the whole
57:38 thing another 50 minutes to go in this
57:39 speech but he fine abusing [ __ ]
57:42 because he was like this Russian
57:43 collusion thing is [ __ ] they're
57:45 feeding you [ __ ] to make you think
57:47 that I'm a criminal which means if he's
57:50 not a criminal then the people who are
57:53 chasing him and this McCarthyism this
57:55 little Adam Schiff dude is a treasonous
57:58 stick sedition based criminal probably
58:01 involved with so much dirty [ __ ] that
58:04 there's only way of keeping you away
58:05 from him
58:06 is to run after and point the finger to
58:08 other people a good friend of mine just
58:11 taught me this beautiful reality and I
58:15 she has a name for it she didn't invent
58:18 this but she she definitely is aware of
58:20 this methodology and it's one of these
58:22 things where
58:23 if someone sees you if they think you've
58:30 seen them excuse me commit a crime or
58:32 that you could find out that they've
58:33 committed a crime they go through
58:36 different stages with how they try to
58:39 you know kill the credibility of the
58:43 witness before ever being caught and
58:45 they can become extremely obsessed with
58:47 this process and so they think well if
58:50 you know if my wife or no I wouldn't be
58:54 that close it probably like if my buddy
58:57 saw me potentially steal something out
59:00 of some food thing at work then if I
59:05 think they're gonna talk about me and
59:06 it's gonna actually hurt my job then
59:09 what I'm gonna do is at work this is the
59:12 Iago talking I'll hurt the credibility
59:15 of this individual slowly and carefully
59:19 over time such that they ever talk about
59:20 me immediately everyone else thinks well
59:25 that's a liar I've heard that that
59:26 person doesn't tell the truth and so no
59:29 one believes them it's what they do you
59:33 know witness assassinations in court
59:34 it's what they try to do to us when we
59:37 try to go after space programs after
59:40 9/11 stuff they try to make conspiracy
59:44 sound horrible well we know for a fact
59:49 that they run the world on Shady
59:52 conspiracies behind our back they simply
59:55 do and we're not crazy right we're not
59:58 these people that need this stuff or
60:01 want this stuff that's the other thing
60:02 you know some people might say well your
60:05 life just isn't going the way that you
60:06 want it to go so what you're doing is
60:08 you're projecting out and converting
60:11 normal things in life into conspiracies
60:13 such that you don't have to take
60:14 responsibility for your actions and what
60:17 you need to do to clean up your life
60:19 it's a scapegoat Theory out towards the
60:23 people that have run the world into the
60:25 [ __ ] ground is 60 million dollars a
60:27 day a big amount of money for the
60:29 country of the United States of America
60:31 you have any idea how much money that is
60:34 it's approximately 22 bill
60:37 million dollars a year twenty two
60:40 billion dollars a year they get stolen
60:43 out of the Treasury collected from
60:48 taxation that goes into an organization
60:50 which albeit employs a lot of Americans
60:53 there's a lot of other people in
60:55 different countries I mean not our money
60:56 but your money and so there's you know
60:59 it's going into pockets it's turning
61:00 back into taxes and all that kind of
61:02 stuff but we have to look at what would
61:05 we do with that money if we formed a
61:08 Space Agency which had integrity but had
61:12 transparency now how do we run the world
61:14 I mean human beings how do we do this as
61:17 far as one country run the world
61:18 well what if we started from scratch and
61:23 we had this idealistic space program
61:25 whereby everything that we discovered
61:27 went on some internet website it's a
61:31 truth appear and we published it to the
61:36 world we figured out new booster rockets
61:38 we figured out anti you know radiation
61:41 systems that could insulate an astronaut
61:45 against anything that's gonna happen in
61:46 space I mean we create some like a
61:49 thousand X radiation thing we can put an
61:52 atom bomb right next to you and as long
61:53 as the concussion doesn't destroy the
61:54 capsule that you're in
61:56 nothing's gonna touch it's just perfect
61:58 and then we get to zero-point energy
62:02 systems which allow us to do
62:04 anti-gravity systems which allow us to
62:05 do in Urschel systems we don't even need
62:08 a booster we just lift ourselves into
62:10 the sky and poof we're off we want to
62:13 build space stations on the moon on Mars
62:16 whatever we can fly through the belly of
62:19 the Sun or at least skim the surface we
62:22 can fly right through coronal mass
62:23 ejections like that dude on Star Trek
62:26 did I forgot which which series that
62:30 episode was has been I think a few that
62:31 were had that narrative well then our
62:36 competitors might do it China might do
62:39 it but they didn't invent it but they'll
62:40 do it because they know how to copy an
62:41 engineer but in anyone else on planet
62:43 earth hats off to that because that's
62:46 not easy
62:46 Russia would do it but maybe our arch
62:50 enemy
62:51 people we have destroyed their countries
62:54 with bombing campaigns by presidents
62:56 prior to their good presidents they
62:58 still have all that those bad feelings
63:00 in those bad memories and they believe
63:01 in absolute extermination of anyone with
63:04 blue eyes light skinned Christian cross
63:08 on your chest they want to kill your ass
63:10 because of all that old [ __ ]
63:12 so transparency is hard so we hide our
63:16 stuff so it's a bit of an idealistic
63:20 problem with a full transparency space
63:22 program okay so we compartmentalize it
63:26 well the who do we tell who do we tell
63:29 you can't just tell anybody because
63:31 someone could infiltrate the program
63:33 from one of those other countries some
63:35 Arab Brotherhood gather wants to blow up
63:37 the [ __ ] in a world you see where
63:40 that naturally creates these
63:42 compartments where anything can occur
63:44 and we can't stop it and so once you
63:49 create these incredible Q clearance
63:54 organizations within the United States
63:56 government
63:56 you can siphon money and you know what
64:01 does it President Carter tried to land
64:02 area 51 he was told no I think it was
64:06 Truman wanted to go to area 51 and they
64:09 said no that's a rumor but I know that
64:12 Carter tried it okay so if the president
64:16 the United States can't go to area 51
64:19 then area 51 can do whatever the [ __ ]
64:22 area 51 wants to do they could do
64:25 nothing they could do everything but no
64:29 one's gonna know whether or not all the
64:30 black op projects those you know $500
64:32 toilet seats $12,000 coffee mugs are
64:36 going for a big party or going for
64:40 covert aircraft that protects the
64:43 country or alien technology that Bob
64:47 Lazar is sitting on top of like was that
64:51 Slim Pickens riding the nuclear bomb and
64:53 dr. Strangelove I think that's why the
64:57 space programs work together well as
65:01 long as everything is fake because no
65:04 one fears fake
65:05 oh you know yeah you trying to do in
65:08 their uh their moon rover thing this
65:10 weekend yeah well well how much did we
65:13 give them not much you know they dug out
65:15 this area that looks pretty much like I
65:17 said well did someone talk to them to
65:18 make sure that the [ __ ] isn't brown so
65:20 anymore well we tried you know we we
65:22 asked him to make sure it's gray we gave
65:24 a bunch of like Pantone colors from our
65:27 our fake missions from 69 to 72 we gave
65:30 them exactly the software and how to do
65:32 it we offered to send representatives
65:35 over but they're a proud country so they
65:37 think they can do it then a week later
65:40 when the photos are produced they're all
65:42 brown soil someone's like god dammit get
65:44 the [ __ ] president she on the phone
65:46 you know you have Trump call him and say
65:49 you cannot be publishing these
65:51 photographs that look completely
65:52 different than our photographs pretty
65:55 sure the moon ain't brown then poof it
65:58 gets edited because the dude makes a
65:59 phone call do we keep these fake space
66:02 programs going because it inspires man
66:04 well when I was a kid and you were asked
66:08 that question all the time what are you
66:09 gonna be when you grow up it was always
66:12 the boys were gonna be firemen or
66:14 doctors and the girls were gonna be
66:15 either nurses or I guess stay-at-home
66:19 moms something like that but one that
66:22 would come up every once in a while for
66:23 both boys and girls at least by the 80s
66:25 especially when NASA came up their
66:27 little training camp which I think was
66:28 brilliant people wanted to be astronauts
66:32 the name of the game was the Space
66:34 Shuttle everybody wanted to go up in
66:36 that thing even when I was a big Space
66:38 Shuttle fan as a kid I you know I going
66:40 up would be cool but I want to go to the
66:42 moon baby I wanted to go out there and
66:44 find that that galaxy long long ago with
66:48 [ __ ] lightsabers the star destroyers
66:50 and Corvettes and Tie Fighters and
66:52 x-wing fighters now when I'm waiting for
66:55 and this whole thing is that China is
66:57 sending something to Mars because that's
67:00 the one that NASA can hit every single
67:02 time NASA tries except for in 1998 we
67:06 hit it every single time because our
67:08 Hollywood machine works fantastic now
67:11 obviously simulating the surface of Mars
67:14 is exceptionally more difficult than
67:17 simulating this
67:19 service of the moon - who do you think's
67:21 in on this thing on the space program
67:24 well what do we think they're really
67:25 doing every time they put up you know
67:29 satellite into space
67:30 I did see a whole movie of them
67:34 launching satellites on the backs of
67:36 weather balloons but they're very very
67:38 small it is sort of hilarious how that
67:42 works but you know just because you can
67:44 do it doesn't mean all of them are doing
67:46 that but again as they've said several
67:50 times on the internet we have sure have
67:53 a lot of pictures of satellites right
67:55 that are taken by what other satellites
67:58 little you know drones up there I've
68:00 been taking them you smile you know look
68:03 sexy for the camera make love to the
68:04 camera people think they've really seen
68:07 photographs of these satellites now when
68:09 the Space Shuttle supposedly is doing
68:11 maintenance of a particular satellite or
68:14 deploying one then supposedly you know
68:17 that's easy to explain because it's
68:19 right there they got cameras and they're
68:20 gonna go fix the double up double the
68:23 Hubble telescope call it the double for
68:26 short that it would seem that the spy
68:30 agencies that have been trading
68:32 information the five eye agencies and
68:34 their satellite technology it's very
68:37 very real again I've been privy to some
68:40 stuff that's very very real in the
68:42 satellite realm that just looked very
68:46 very real and extremely detailed
68:51 so if satellites aren't real they're
68:54 certainly building a [ __ ] ton of them my
68:57 old co-host he was taken through NASA
69:00 Ames and was shown several satellites
69:03 inside of a warehouse it was all
69:05 hermetically sealed everybody had their
69:06 suit on so they're spending a tremendous
69:09 amount of money they're actually
69:10 building these things and it would seem
69:12 that well the one point they made with
69:15 these weather balloons that were pulling
69:17 up satellites is that the one I saw
69:19 launched the person who made the videos
69:22 so that that satellite weighed eight
69:24 thousand pounds so four ton satellites
69:27 just lifted into the sky no problem at
69:30 all the ones that I've seen that
69:33 on the ground in foreign countries
69:36 they're sitting there beeping and
69:37 everyone's filming it with their cell
69:38 phones
69:38 those are measurably smaller than these
69:41 eight thousand-pound ones but anything
69:43 that goes up comes down but again the
69:45 theory of gravity as dictated by ether
69:49 all wins / equal you throw water it
69:52 makes complete sense to be able to throw
69:54 something into orbit there's no problem
69:55 with that but you do have to throw it
69:57 into space and you throw it so fast that
70:00 when it tries to fall back to earth it
70:02 falls around Earth and all the outside
70:05 pressure pushing in keeps it there but
70:08 again it has its own forward momentum
70:10 that when you're in the weak weak field
70:13 of gravity it takes a long time to lose
70:15 its orbit and fall down if it had some
70:17 mechanism to use the whatever atmosphere
70:22 is there about 200 miles up which isn't
70:25 a vacuum obviously it should be able to
70:28 use normal rocket fuel and get itself
70:31 pushed back up and sustain the orbit for
70:33 a really long time I'm unaware of any
70:36 mechanism that they've developed for
70:39 satellites whereby they don't need
70:42 actual fuel so once the tank is empty
70:45 and that thing is coming down whatever
70:48 graduated or but it has but when you
70:52 talk about these organizations and you
70:55 know I get it's funny because I get
70:56 people coming onto the comments and God
70:58 bless you guys usually newcomers and
71:01 they'll say boy they know you they know
71:04 your number alright you know my views
71:08 are not that great my subscription
71:11 counts and not that great and there's
71:12 dudes out there really really parsing
71:16 this stuff and they have a million
71:18 subscribers and they're saying the same
71:20 thing I'm saying they're saying it
71:21 better than I'm saying it they got five
71:23 minute videos with you know half a
71:27 million views if not 12 million views
71:29 those are the people that if there are
71:31 people to worry about those people
71:32 they're the ones on that radar I am so
71:34 far down the list the pagination would
71:38 have to go for miles before you see my
71:40 name now the only risk that we run in
71:42 this truth game is that maybe like an
71:45 episode like this
71:46 I'm saying it's a business they're
71:48 selling this space program to other
71:51 countries you know I don't know if
71:53 that's true I don't really think it
71:55 takes that much to fake this kind of
71:57 stuff but say that was true and no one
71:59 else on the whole Internet's revealing
72:01 that and I put that up there and boom it
72:03 it becomes really popular it's my
72:06 breakthrough video my subscriptions hit
72:10 100,000 and it's just growing like crazy
72:13 then maybe they're alarmed but when I
72:17 think of this stuff I think about who
72:20 would protect the lie and that's really
72:23 the magnitude of the threat and then how
72:26 intense is the exposure how what's the
72:31 rate of growth of the community that is
72:33 believing this stuff you know we know of
72:36 a lot of people bill Cooper being one of
72:38 them that were murdered because they
72:41 were on to things early but the thing
72:45 about them is that they were the
72:46 singular voice at a time when the truth
72:51 movement was you know just a tiny little
72:54 fungus about to grow they tried to nip
72:57 it in the bud they tried to get rid of
72:58 this viral growth and thank God
73:01 people clamped on bill Cooper also came
73:05 with military credentials hi Clarence
73:08 credentials he was inside the UFO
73:11 program for at least 20 years before he
73:13 came out he was doing CNN interviews he
73:16 had a pretty good following
73:17 so again he wasn't just dropping bombs
73:21 over the target he was waking up
73:25 everyone and teaching them how to drop
73:26 bombs on the target so they had to
73:28 eliminate that guy I don't know how many
73:30 of you dig the fact that our president
73:32 got rid of the cell phone spying program
73:35 of course there's speculation there's a
73:37 replacement but whatever I actually
73:40 believe he did it
73:41 do they have replacements for that well
73:44 sure but do they have to spy on our
73:46 phones all the time to get it I think
73:47 not I think they got a different
73:49 technique it's far less invasive
73:50 probably creates a lot less data a lot
73:54 less burden on the intelligence agents
73:56 that are actually 100% freedom lovers
73:59 who would protect us if there was any
74:02 hit put out on us or some [ __ ] like
74:04 that and what's interesting is when we
74:08 were when I was doing in kala radio with
74:11 Kyle there was definitely a point when
74:14 we were in the middle of the show and we
74:18 just thought okay let's do a this
74:21 mention inside of an episode that we
74:22 would never commit suicide such that if
74:25 it happens and that's the way it's
74:26 blamed and we get cremated before our
74:28 families even give consent I don't want
74:30 to be cremated by the way I want to get
74:32 buried in the same cemetery my family's
74:35 buried in in my hometown which is just
74:38 west of the town so if I ever get
74:41 cremated it's against my will a thousand
74:43 [ __ ] percent I don't care if I'm
74:45 [ __ ] ground up in some horrible ass
74:48 accident somewhere you put all those
74:50 little body parts I'm not worried about
74:52 [ __ ] going off and getting taken over
74:54 there river styxx and hunting I just
74:57 don't want it to be done putting a
74:59 little uh little Costco meat bag and
75:01 just put inside some sort of coffin put
75:05 me on the ground and now that I know
75:07 that's the way they hide their method of
75:10 death
75:12 it even appeals to me more nowadays than
75:14 it did in the past what's interesting
75:17 about this time this is what I'll close
75:19 with what's interesting about this time
75:21 in history is that we're watching we're
75:24 watching folks maneuver in the world to
75:27 preserve their conspiracies to preserve
75:31 their way of life which is complete
75:33 domination of other people at the
75:35 expense of other people's happiness and
75:37 prosperity and freedom we're seeing them
75:40 maneuver like crazy you realize that
75:43 thirty years ago I'm just gonna throw
75:46 that out there in the mid or the
75:48 beginning of the 90s I should say we
75:51 didn't know who these people were
75:52 on average I mean there were people who
75:54 knew but those were just you could count
75:58 them on probably two hands and now we
76:02 know we know their names we know where
76:06 their trusts are hidden
76:08 we know what corporations they owned we
76:12 know what
76:13 families blowing - what banking
76:14 institutions but investment banking
76:17 houses they belong to we know what
76:19 politicians are bought off by certain
76:21 lobbyists we know because they tow their
76:25 line right in front of our face Neil's
76:28 Cortes chick she's very interesting
76:30 because she is as dumb as a human being
76:34 gets super sad super sad but she is a
76:40 bag of hammers if there ever was one so
76:44 she's obviously not writing any of the
76:46 content that she's submitting this new
76:49 Green Deal she didn't write it someone
76:52 else wrote it someone else gave it to
76:54 her and his asinine as the project is
76:56 and is poorly written as the deal is on
76:58 piece of paper that's not her brain
77:01 that's someone else's brain the [ __ ]
77:02 chick was a bartender and now she's
77:05 she's a house representative that
77:08 academic track does not lead to being a
77:12 representative of the United States of
77:14 America in any capacity what so ever
77:16 unless you're in the catering booth at a
77:19 bartender at a bar pouring drinks for
77:22 people who are actually educated enough
77:25 to represent our country we have again
77:29 certification to be a doctor to do
77:31 surgery to fix an eyeball
77:33 we have certification for engineers and
77:37 architects to make sure that they know
77:39 what the hell they're talking about
77:40 before they build a big giant hundred
77:41 and ten story skyscraper because we
77:44 don't the damn thing falling down but we
77:47 have absolutely no requirements of
77:49 people that run this country or the rest
77:51 of the world all of your countries
77:53 anyone could be President Trudeau the
77:58 drama teacher the drama teacher full
78:01 [ __ ] blown shill if you were a
78:03 Canadian oh my god for all the [ __ ] they
78:06 might say about Donald Trump the guys
78:07 were ten billion dollars in built an
78:09 empire from very little money
78:11 graduated top of his class has proven
78:15 his intellect and his ability to do
78:17 business to run massive organizations
78:20 with all kinds of races in it by the way
78:23 he's got credentials but we don't have
78:26 any credential requirement
78:27 to influence the laws of a country well
78:31 who do you think put that [ __ ] together
78:33 back in the day it was just a given you
78:36 needed to be an established person to be
78:38 a politician you had to have some
78:41 academic or business accomplishment to
78:45 get those roles today nothing and why is
78:50 that the case because they can put their
78:52 shills in to push buttons I vote yes I
78:55 vote yes so I can owe their paycheck
78:57 yeah you do okay I push yes I well the
79:00 facts came in this morning
79:01 back in the 90s then I was an email
79:03 comes in tells you how to vote if
79:05 someone's missing they run over and push
79:07 their button for them that happens at
79:08 the state level all the time in this
79:10 country I saw a video where it revealed
79:13 the fact that state legislations all
79:15 over the country people run down and
79:17 push other people's buttons because
79:21 they're not there they couldn't spare
79:22 their time they couldn't get up early
79:24 enough to come down and vote so someone
79:26 else pushes their button for them I
79:28 think anyone who's caught pushing
79:30 someone else's button you are pulled out
79:34 of office you have handcuffs put on you
79:36 and you're put in jail not forever but
79:41 long enough that you will think about
79:44 what you did you'll be forbidden from
79:46 ever holding office and just like a
79:48 soldier that commits a crime it gets
79:51 dishonorably discharged you get a
79:53 dishonorably discharged credential
79:55 you're put into a database like a
79:57 predator and anybody who would hire you
80:00 they just look up that database if they
80:02 don't already know you're a total piece
80:04 of [ __ ] you go you're a [ __ ]
80:06 that cast votes for somebody else you
80:10 influence the laws of my state illegally
80:14 you've manipulated them I don't want you
80:17 working for my country or company excuse
80:19 me I don't want you teaching my kit I
80:22 don't want you watching my kid I got a
80:26 job over at that factory you can you can
80:28 push a broom but those other people push
80:32 on brooms with you they have higher
80:33 integrity than you do we're doing you a
80:35 [ __ ] favor again if we win that the
80:39 truth move it wins if the great
80:41 wakening wins if this country gets
80:43 re-engineered if JFK jr. pops out of
80:45 nowhere and runs with Trump or becomes a
80:48 president some point or just whatever if
80:50 we win and the truth comes out these are
80:55 the things we need to correct
80:57 immediately in the space programs being
81:00 for sale being a mechanism to manipulate
81:03 people that's got to come to an end we
81:06 need a space program we do we need to
81:09 find out where we are
81:11 it should be real simple to prove
81:13 whether or not the earth is a spinning
81:15 disk or a spinning ball with photos
81:18 should be very very simple there should
81:20 be some offer to the average human being
81:22 to say okay mark Sargent do you think
81:26 this place is a disc I got a lot of
81:28 friends to think that guy is a complete
81:29 psyops shill I have no opinion but they
81:33 should be able to give that you know
81:35 what do you want man what do you want to
81:37 be able to prove this place is a ball
81:39 that spins all right we'll get your
81:42 video cameras get your backpack we're
81:44 gonna put a spacesuit on you you can do
81:46 whatever it is we'll even re-engineer
81:49 the rocket to meet your requirements
81:51 that should be pretty easy to do
81:53 wouldn't that be the most incredibly
81:56 entertaining Falcon 9 launch from SpaceX
82:00 to say dude we're gonna do this and
82:02 we're gonna fight the average public of
82:06 all the conspiracy people that think the
82:07 satellites don't exist you know I've had
82:10 a lot of speculation I know they view CG
82:12 to do the retrorockets landing back down
82:14 earth these things could work today but
82:17 there's been some fake-ass [ __ ] out
82:19 there analyzed by the best minds in the
82:21 world to create all your movies and
82:22 they're like that [ __ ] is fake doesn't
82:25 mean they haven't done at one point in
82:26 time but we need to have all the
82:30 conspiracy people invited to these
82:31 events and just clear the table make it
82:34 okay
82:35 for those of people like myself we're
82:41 gonna have to develop a protocol to
82:43 validate the stuff on Mars to validate
82:46 what's been claimed about the moon
82:47 missions techniques that are absolutely
82:50 bulletproof put it out there an
82:51 open-source bunch of brilliant minds
82:53 again
82:54 because a trash truck but brilliant
82:58 minds that can put check sums in to make
83:00 sure that everything is proven I think
83:04 that'd be great I mean the fact that
83:07 these things are not being done for me
83:09 validates the lie more than anything
83:11 because you're talking about super easy
83:14 things to prove let me think about it
83:16 if Trump walked in the office and said
83:18 look you got a problem
83:20 NASA GPL nobody thinks your [ __ ] is real
83:23 I mean nobody say it gets to that point
83:27 but way before it gets that point we got
83:29 60 million people they don't think it's
83:31 real all right I'm gonna give you a
83:34 billion dollars I want you to start a
83:37 brand new public program we're gonna
83:39 give you all the resources you need
83:41 create a website social media everything
83:44 we're gonna harvest for 24 months every
83:49 single conspiracy about what you've done
83:51 and you're gonna build rockets and
83:54 you're gonna sub it out - maybe SpaceX
83:55 because they're also suspect maybe it's
83:59 half your [ __ ] half their stuff and
84:01 we're gonna have you guys launch you're
84:04 gonna invite all these people out there
84:06 you're gonna take a few guys up so they
84:08 can look down again the stuff that I've
84:12 been able to calculate with the eyeball
84:15 and the spherical earth 80 miles up
84:18 you're gonna start seeing the curve
84:20 undeniably if it's there again observing
84:24 a disk at certain angles will also look
84:26 around so you're gonna have to make sure
84:27 the earth turns a complete 360
84:29 underneath the camera it's never turned
84:32 off I'd love to see the space capsule
84:35 from the moon landings come in backwards
84:37 on its blast shield and survive all this
84:40 turbulence without rolling and killing
84:42 everybody inside you does look like
84:45 project Orion is still going by the way
84:47 they do keep their data classified but
84:49 they did officially cancel that project
84:51 at one point again who makes this no one
84:54 would make that [ __ ] up right I wouldn't
84:56 let go
84:56 out of thin air uh it's been canceled I
84:59 just make it up anyway I think you guys
85:02 feel me this episode is kind of bouncing
85:05 around a little bit but it touches on a
85:06 bunch of subjects
85:07 think we're all thinking about when we
85:09 think about these you know the subject
85:11 matter you know when I talk to folks
85:14 downstairs this is the average sort of
85:16 card of sort of sway that happens on
85:20 these conversations so I thought it put
85:22 it all in an episode so we can kind of
85:23 break it open and what better place to
85:25 do it than the smoke lounge if you
85:28 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
85:29 please go
85:30 it lets you switch from audio to video
85:33 and video to audio there's the locked
85:35 facebook group the coolest place in the
85:37 world to go we have a Twitter account
85:39 now in case some of you like to get your
85:42 notifications through Twitter I doubt
85:44 there's a hell of a lot of you we don't
85:46 have that many followers but we'll see
85:48 we'll see what happens there again I am
85:52 testing Brighton comm which is Bri
85:56 ght eo-n comm again I'm also testing
86:01 [ __ ] shoot last time I tried to upload
86:03 the [ __ ] shoot it rejected my video
86:04 because it said that it was over an hour
86:08 the same thing was the case with vid me
86:10 but then I worked with those founders
86:13 and they immediately blessed the channel
86:15 and so I put the whole show up there
86:16 which was great until the dummy went out
86:18 of business which is unfortunate
86:20 so there's also patreon count for those
86:23 of you who want to tip me for what I'm
86:26 doing here pays for cigars space for new
86:29 hardware again I bought this 4k camera I
86:32 have not collected enough money to pay
86:34 for the entire camera but we're doing
86:37 better these days I am taking just full
86:39 disclosure here because I know in the
86:41 past in season one definitely I said you
86:45 know I don't need any money for this
86:46 whole thing I don't necessarily need
86:48 money but it definitely helps out and it
86:51 sort of inspires the program cigars
86:53 aren't cheap they're about ten bucks a
86:55 pop if I'm smoking an average stick if I
86:57 get a nice deal on a box they can get
86:59 down to about 550 so that's awesome
87:01 always looking for new deals so anyway
87:04 until next time and take care of
87:07 yourself and someone else and I will see
87:09 in the next deep thoughts over now
