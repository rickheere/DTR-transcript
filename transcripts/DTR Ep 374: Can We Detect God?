00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen on this early Saturday morning
00:38 about three o'clock in the morning as
00:43 per request of one of listeners I'm
00:45 smoking the Herrera ass telly Toro
00:47 shaped cigar it's just a box i got from
00:51 halts calm once a year they offer this
00:53 box for nothing
00:54 a little over 100 bucks for 25 sticks
00:57 it's probably around 200 bucks so the
01:01 box just came in tonight's episode is a
01:07 listener request which I thought was
01:09 quite brilliant and I think that I've
01:11 sort of remotely touched on it the
01:15 listeners name is actually fairly
01:17 interesting I'll a for complex reasons
01:21 I'm gonna try to get better with your
01:23 requests versus me announcing it a bunch
01:26 of you have made requests that have
01:28 turned into episodes feel free to take
01:30 credit for it because you are the ones
01:32 that gave me the idea tonight's topic as
01:38 you can tell from the title is can we
01:41 detect god I just released the new
01:46 version of episode 44 I think entitled
01:50 God in the new season one remastering
01:53 which you can access by going to deep
01:55 thoughts radio comm and clicking season
01:57 one link at the top which will send you
02:00 directly to the channel on youtube again
02:01 for any of you who dig the show
02:03 especially in Europe you want to get
02:06 over there and subscribe to that channel
02:07 because there's going to be a ton of
02:09 episodes probably from fifty to a
02:12 hundred that you haven't seen because I
02:14 started using a bunch of music that bans
02:16 the episodes on mobile devices globally
02:19 and just in Europe in general but I was
02:23 listening to the goddess ode and I have
02:26 to say it is one of my finest episodes
02:28 I've ever done and then remastered
02:30 version sounds so good so definitely if
02:34 you dig this episode it's a good prequel
02:37 to this episode
02:41 and I think I've got the angle for this
02:43 episode because it occurred to me like
02:45 that was such a great idea of saying can
02:48 we detect God's existence
02:50 that's a heavy concept right let's just
02:55 assume that a bunch of you just heard me
02:57 say that and and you're like of course
02:58 not dude of course not
03:00 no matter what you say of course not and
03:03 you can be one of my staunch supporters
03:05 and love the show but your your
03:06 instincts are just course nuttin this is
03:11 gonna be interesting for an hour
03:12 listening to you talk about something
03:14 that's impossible okay so let me share
03:21 the hook with you right off the bat if I
03:25 said to you how do we detect radiation
03:29 how do we detect electricity how do we
03:32 detect everything in this universe that
03:34 we feel is real versus not real the
03:38 simple answer is well we've built a
03:41 machine and the machine detects changes
03:44 in the state of the universe and reports
03:47 it back either through audio or visual
03:49 form typically and we look at it the
03:54 Hadron Collider a Geiger counter an old
03:59 tube television that's checking out the
04:01 the gun that's shooting at the
04:04 phosphorus layer inside the television
04:05 tube when you saw a pixel on the screen
04:08 well you knew that that was occurring
04:12 all right so machines are the way that
04:16 we detect everything and if a machine
04:18 doesn't exist to detect something that
04:20 it doesn't exist in our primitive
04:22 primitive arrogant human minds there's a
04:28 couple caches to that couple caches are
04:31 off the way cuz we're talking about
04:32 detecting the intangible aren't we one
04:36 we have to agree on what it is that we
04:39 consider to be feedback that is tangible
04:42 to then quantify it into a
04:46 classification of exists versus doesn't
04:48 exist right well you know if we can
04:53 you know since the dielectric wave or
04:56 the magnetism wave or the
04:57 electromagnetism wave as they collide
04:59 with each other then we consider those
05:00 things to be real there certain hadron
05:03 collider has all these plates that sense
05:06 electrical disturbances and because the
05:10 plates are all beside each other as the
05:12 selectable disturbance flies through the
05:14 plates they've got a three-dimensional
05:16 image of its flight path after the two
05:18 protons slam into each other and that's
05:20 the story that's been going on for
05:21 particle accelerators since they were
05:23 invented now they believe they can sense
05:27 gravity waves which is basically ether
05:29 away --vs because ether is like water
05:32 and of course there's waves because
05:35 water and waves go together it's
05:37 basically not infinitely dense out there
05:42 in space there is space between ether
05:44 particles and when you have space
05:46 between particles that are super packed
05:48 together and they all have to get along
05:50 they're gonna bump into each other and
05:52 those bumps are gonna ripple and they're
05:55 gonna create verbs we call waves the
05:58 wave is in an object the wave is a
06:00 verbal reaction of something okay a
06:03 machine is well it's built out of a
06:06 bunch of sensors isn't it and typically
06:08 what we use is the same exact thing to
06:11 sense the thing that we're sensing hmm
06:15 so how does a cell phone pick up a
06:18 telephone call well it uses a power
06:21 supply that turns into an
06:23 electromagnetic field around the phone
06:25 depending on how far you are away from
06:27 your base station the magnetic field
06:30 around the phone can be four times as
06:33 big as the phone which is why they're
06:35 super cancerous to keep next to your
06:37 body use the headset folks with the wire
06:39 I know it's cumbersome but so is cancer
06:43 but once we see a disturbance and the
06:46 fact that we have this wave that's very
06:48 you know without any signal coming
06:50 around the phone it's beautiful it's
06:52 just perfect we send out a certain
06:53 amount of electromagnetic waves and
06:57 we're expected to get back an X amount
06:59 as the as the pulse goes around the
07:01 phone just like a magnetic waves when
07:03 you put shavings on a piece of paper and
07:05 a magnet underneath you see the poles
07:06 are
07:07 the magnet exact same path that goes
07:09 around your telephone except it's
07:10 invisible as that wave gets disturbed by
07:15 other waves from a cell phone tower
07:17 they're able to synthesize a binary
07:20 packet system zeros and ones perhaps a
07:24 null 2 nothing nothing's coming through
07:27 you lost your signal you lost your
07:29 packet transmission it's - gargling -
07:32 weird we can't figure out what it is
07:33 we're gonna read transmit that packet ok
07:35 thank God for tcp/ip or maybe you think
07:39 Tesla I don't know what's the difference
07:43 so let's see official science is
07:49 machines using the same exact element to
07:54 sense other elements of the same kind
07:56 and then it becomes real ok I'm
08:00 subscribed to that that works I know
08:03 that that works that's how I'm able to
08:05 pick up things digitally through
08:06 wireless technology that Tesla invented
08:10 what is the human body what is the human
08:15 body for those of you saw West world you
08:18 have an extremely elaborate answer we
08:23 are machines aren't we aren't we
08:25 machines don't we have sensors don't we
08:31 acknowledge in scientific books that we
08:34 have five senses most of us believe we
08:38 have six seven eight nine and perhaps
08:39 even infinite senses but we know we have
08:41 five how would you define God and what
08:48 God is made out of so that you can use
08:49 the same exact substance that you
08:52 believe God is made out of just like
08:53 these machines such that you could
08:56 acknowledge detecting him hmm
09:01 interesting well hmm I think in the most
09:06 conservative form God is considered to
09:08 be pretty omnipotent and in control of
09:11 everything if you believe in God you
09:12 believe that God is in control of
09:15 everything now whether or not God
09:16 reaches down and touches every single
09:18 ether a particle we're
09:20 yet to find out did he set it in motion
09:22 I think so if he exists
09:25 not so God definitely would have a
09:29 relationship with all things tangible
09:31 that we're discussing in the previous
09:33 section here is that what God is is got
09:37 just a pachinko game it's just dropping
09:39 balls through pins is God just a speaker
09:42 on a stereo
09:43 does he logic through a silicon chip
09:46 that all God is was he a supernova
09:50 who's he a galaxy as he universe hmm
09:55 pardon the example but there's one point
09:59 in man's history of existence each
10:04 individual man woman human we're calling
10:09 out God's name it's pretty unanimous in
10:13 any language in any culture this thing
10:16 happens and you call out God's name we
10:20 make love and we climax and when we
10:24 climax man says oh my god oh god god god
10:29 ooh the big O face comes with the g.od
10:31 word typically even if it's synthesized
10:36 into a swear phrase that's what we say
10:41 okay so what is the big giant apex that
10:47 occurs that makes us say that I don't
10:52 know about you but I I've actually had
10:56 that experience hopefully you guys have
10:57 too if you're of age honestly if you
11:01 can't have this emotion don't do it but
11:06 you're in a state of incredible emotion
11:08 and usually the emotion is love for at
11:12 least if if you've completely missed the
11:16 target at least you're loving the
11:17 physical feeling that you've had and you
11:19 have perhaps no affection for the person
11:21 you're with but if you're on target for
11:23 the way it's supposed to be done you're
11:26 in love with the person that you're
11:27 doing it with at least at that moment in
11:29 time hopefully not to toxicated right
11:33 but you're experiencing this
11:36 unbelievable three-dimensional
11:38 experience which gurus say from India
11:41 they say that when you climax you
11:43 actually exchange part of your souls I
11:47 saw that Ana Netflix special where guy
11:50 want to and traveled around the world in
11:52 a series talking to gurus of all kinds
11:54 and I thought that was beautiful he
11:55 actually was studying religion he was
11:58 fairly atheist I believe are sort of
12:00 agnostic he wasn't quite sure but I
12:03 think that's true which is why every
12:05 time you make love to someone regardless
12:07 of how frivolous the moment is or how
12:09 deep and special it is you're bonded for
12:10 life you see that person again you have
12:15 that feeling that weird
12:17 indistinguishable unique feeling of oh
12:19 yeah I have experienced really the
12:22 ultimate physical in exchange with that
12:25 other human being which is why the
12:28 Guru's they don't sleep around because
12:31 if you exchange a bunch of different
12:33 souls with a bunch of different people
12:34 your preferences are so messed up you'll
12:37 never be happy with anyone in your whole
12:38 life because the person you finally try
12:40 to settle on will be missing some of the
12:43 things that these other people you've
12:44 slept with will have and you will
12:47 convince yourself there's someone better
12:49 there's someone I don't have the right
12:50 person it's simply because you've
12:52 deluded yourself you have to commit to
12:55 one candy bar you know if you've never
12:57 eaten sugar before you could probably
12:59 commit to the first thing you ever eat
13:01 but if you've eaten every candy bar how
13:03 could you possibly settle for Snickers
13:04 how could you possibly settle for eath
13:06 bar this isn't have that thing have
13:10 another thing the other thing has
13:11 another thing indebted to death why am i
13:14 bringing this up I think God in one
13:19 quantifiable definition is love it's
13:23 love I have this friend who posts her
13:27 dog all the time on Instagram
13:30 and her Facebook and she's a wonderful
13:34 person but this dog is the cutest thing
13:36 you've ever seen your life I mean I
13:38 don't even know what kind of dog it is
13:39 little little tiny dog like tight curls
13:43 kind of like a poodle but not a pool
13:45 it's
13:46 justing I don't really have a Finity for
13:48 poodles but this is a different dog but
13:52 I've seen all these specials there was a
13:53 great little animation online talking
13:55 about the life of a person who's an
13:59 empath person who feels other people's
14:00 feelings it's this animation of someone
14:04 carrying around a little bit of Darkness
14:06 and they're all this sort of like these
14:07 white characters with these black
14:09 outlines and and as they're experiencing
14:11 something negative they have like black
14:13 filled up in their hands and they end up
14:15 crying on the shoulder of this empath
14:17 and then the black comes out of their
14:19 hands and goes into the empath and this
14:22 sequence keeps going where they keep
14:24 meeting people going through all these
14:25 problems until they fill up completely
14:28 black the empath has to carry all of the
14:31 angst of all these people that they've
14:33 helped by being empathetic and help
14:35 helping them heal and seeing in a
14:37 different perspective perhaps and so
14:40 they go home and they're just all
14:42 depressed they're filled with black and
14:45 they have a dog and they put their head
14:48 against their dog's head who's obviously
14:50 there for you because that's what dogs
14:52 do cats aren't that way in my opinion
14:55 cats like what have you done for me
14:57 lately
14:57 you know cat people will disagree with
14:59 me but it shows all the black draining
15:04 out of this empath and it goes away it
15:06 doesn't go into the dog it disappears
15:08 the dog is pure love and that is why the
15:11 empath heals when they go back home to
15:13 their pet ok love love is amazing love
15:22 is very very very real
15:24 why does anyone kill themselves because
15:27 there's love missing love for life love
15:31 for family love for friends love for a
15:33 purpose that's why I used to say in
15:37 season one all the time in season two
15:39 love is purpose and purposes love isn't
15:43 that interesting when you find your
15:45 purpose you're feeling loved in your
15:47 life for whatever that is your child
15:50 your career creativity yourself don't
15:54 worry about loving yourself I got an
15:56 episode called loving yourself in a
15:57 season one I believe doesn't get watched
15:59 because there
16:00 thinks it's all fruity it's extremely
16:02 important you don't let any religion or
16:04 doctrine ever guilt you away from
16:07 looking in the mirror and going that
16:09 dude or that chick is amazing right oh
16:12 yeah
16:13 you know you must I deal in electronics
16:18 a little bit and the two pieces of
16:21 equipment I have to use all the time and
16:22 dealing with electronics is my voltage
16:23 meter and if you get deep into it now
16:27 oscilloscope which helps you look at the
16:30 frequency of electricity in a waveform
16:32 so you can see how healthy the wave is
16:34 to figure out how healthy a particular
16:35 component is and digital electronics
16:37 we're looking for square waves that
16:41 transmit digital signals high and a low
16:43 is a positive and a negative a binary
16:46 signal that's the way all electronics
16:47 work for more analog equipment we're
16:50 looking for more sine wave transmissions
16:53 alright so I got two machines that help
16:55 me track the things that they are made
16:58 out of good now we are the voltage meter
17:04 of love we are the oscilloscope of love
17:08 we are we feel it what happens when you
17:12 find someone that you haven't seen in a
17:15 long time and you realize oh my god I
17:17 can't believe I haven't seen you in a
17:19 really long time there's a big smile on
17:21 your face your heart blows up inside
17:23 with all that love all those memories of
17:26 all the things you've ever done together
17:27 and you guys give yourself either a bro
17:29 hug or a nice hug of any kind and you
17:35 can feel it in your chest right you can
17:37 feel the love literally transmitting
17:38 between your chest all that frequency of
17:42 human condition that we're missing
17:43 because social media has filled up our
17:45 lives with these people we've never met
17:47 no I love everybody I haven't met who's
17:50 on the channel but we all know it would
17:53 be much more rich and amazing if we
17:54 would see more human beings I have this
17:57 episode called losing our humanity and
18:00 the social media thing and there's
18:02 there's a bunch of you know episodes
18:05 I've done about the fact we don't
18:06 interact with each other that much and
18:08 it's not my Epiphany hell even the
18:10 comedian George Carlin gave this
18:11 beautiful monologue about it
18:13 in written form talking about how we're
18:17 well you know honestly Charlie Chaplin
18:22 in the Great Dictator way back in 1941
18:25 in March of 41 before Pearl Harbor ever
18:28 happened he was talking about how we've
18:32 got all this great communication but
18:33 where we're going inside more than
18:36 outside staying in to listen to the
18:38 radio staying in to watch television
18:40 staying in staying in staying in instead
18:42 of getting out there and meeting people
18:44 the Millennials are I should say even
18:47 the Gen Z's excuse me are the ones that
18:50 are not so hot on it they really like
18:52 seeing each other they're not on social
18:55 media as much it's a beautiful thing I'm
18:59 gonna get back our humanity hopefully in
19:00 the process what the question is can we
19:04 detect god I think the problem is is
19:09 it's sort of like The Hitchhiker's Guide
19:11 the galaxy and the deep thoughts
19:12 computer he thought of the answer to
19:14 life the universe and everything and
19:16 when he gave it to them which is the
19:19 number 42 they were like what the hell
19:21 is this he says well I think the problem
19:23 is you haven't really figured out the
19:24 question I says well fine tell us what
19:27 the question is he goes I can't I'm
19:29 gonna have to design a computer bigger
19:31 than me to determine the question and
19:34 that was planet Earth with all of its
19:36 bio life on he goes the whole thing will
19:38 be a biomatter computer life itself will
19:42 be the circuitry to think up the
19:44 question to life the universe and
19:46 everything and about one minute before
19:49 it was about to give its answer it was
19:52 destroyed by a Vogon fleet to make room
19:54 for a hyperspace bypass
19:56 I think the funny thing is is that the
19:59 answer is yes and the answer is yes yeah
20:04 God's detectable and God has been
20:07 detected that's the answer the problem
20:10 is is that we don't have a paradigm of
20:12 thought that allows that to be the
20:14 answer to even be known as the question
20:17 in the answer because for us we are so
20:21 stuck in the mass-energy model of the
20:26 universe that we negate
20:27 the most amazing thing ever which is
20:30 love
20:32 some people might roll their eyes and go
20:35 oh my god you know there you go and your
20:37 hippie crap you know you got some
20:38 crystals you're hanging on to as well
20:40 while you're doing this episode well no
20:45 but let's just take this paradigm a
20:52 little further than just the assertion
20:56 so you go to college you go to college
20:59 in 2019 someone put ten million dollars
21:01 in a bank account not the one that
21:04 bought Obama's goal degree in Harvard
21:07 the the Prince of Saudi Arabia that
21:09 bought his degree which is why I never
21:11 showed up but you put one in there and
21:14 you're really gonna go to school you
21:17 really gonna learn about things and one
21:21 of the courses that they're gonna offer
21:22 you is this course and so in a
21:28 traditional 2019 college you know that
21:31 if you go into an engineering department
21:33 or you gonna theoretical physics
21:35 department or physics department or
21:36 chemistry department or any Science
21:38 Division of any kind aerospace whatever
21:41 it's all set up for you they've already
21:44 thought up all the paradigms of your
21:46 belief systems including ridiculous
21:48 theories like black holes and big bangs
21:50 and dark matter and all this other crap
21:53 that doesn't exist but they'll convince
21:57 you it's real because they they have
22:00 built a test that is ludicrous and then
22:05 they say that they have satisfied the
22:06 test results so that you can find the
22:09 Higgs boson god particle a completely
22:13 made-up bunch of crap I mean people were
22:16 really trying to come up with something
22:17 to explain the ultimate particle in the
22:19 universe but it's all crap it's all crap
22:23 imagine me coming up with the the deep
22:26 thoughts particle but my only paradigm
22:29 for proving that it is real as I say
22:31 okay
22:32 if you walk outside and you feel a
22:34 little bit of wind on your skin that's
22:36 the deep thoughts particle so if you go
22:38 out and feel that wind on your face then
22:40 you've
22:41 scuf for the deep thoughts particle
22:42 really yeah go try it you wanna try it
22:45 one be the first one yeah sure so you
22:47 walk out on this patio and you're like I
22:49 feel like do you feel that I feel it - I
22:51 feel important can we get a bunch of
22:53 money from Grants and stuff to say this
22:55 is real and does the defaults particle
22:57 negate the existence of God well I guess
22:59 it could okay well great let's get a
23:01 bunch of money from these deep Staters
23:04 who want you to not believe in God but
23:06 to believe in them because then they get
23:08 to become God I see how it works
23:12 oh and if you can get rid of any free
23:15 energy or you know world poverty
23:19 solutions with this deep thoughts
23:20 particle we could probably raise ten to
23:22 a million times more money because then
23:25 we'll have to go to them for all the
23:26 solutions what if you came to the deep
23:29 thoughts college whenever that starts
23:31 and in our college we have all those
23:34 engineering schools - all the crappy
23:36 religion of science the capitalist
23:39 religion of science Neil deGrasse Tyson
23:42 is a freshman in our College with no
23:47 hope of getting a PhD at our school
23:49 unless he undoes all this crappy
23:52 theories he's been carrying his whole
23:53 life he'll Stephen W Hawking all his
23:58 scholarly work is zero nothing have no
24:01 value to us whatsoever because he was
24:04 worshipping false paradigms of science
24:06 gravity is a pull natural phenomenon
24:10 instead of the push that it really is
24:12 right but the coolest part we have is
24:16 this big giant wing of our College and
24:20 it's the spirituality wing it's the God
24:22 wing where we endorse the paradigm of
24:26 love being what God is at least
24:29 partially comprised of if not ultimately
24:32 comprised of well okay so what does the
24:35 laboratory look like in the engineering
24:37 department and what does the laboratory
24:38 look like in our spirituality department
24:41 I'm gonna go electronic department first
24:44 it's more familiar to you and there's
24:47 more machines that go Bing in there and
24:49 you walk in and there's all the voltage
24:51 meters and oscilloscopes all kinds of
24:53 huge ones
24:54 big supercomputers quantum computers
24:57 there's an accelerator out back there's
25:01 laser Bay's and all kinds of wild stuff
25:03 look at photon waves okay and you go to
25:08 the spirituality room and there's a
25:11 bunch of sofas and beanbags and there's
25:16 notebooks everywhere really cool ones
25:18 with all kinds of fancy designs on the
25:20 outside and you rush over to one of the
25:22 notebooks and you open it up and it's
25:23 blank but there's a pin waiting for you
25:26 right there right in the center the
25:28 spine of the book and you're like okay
25:33 what what gives man what gives and I
25:37 said well you're the machine in this
25:40 department you tell me sit down relax if
25:45 you want some hallucinogenics we have
25:46 some safe ones over here you can take
25:48 and won't rot your mind won't still
25:50 won't you didn't eat relapses we got
25:53 rooms to trip in cuz we'll have
25:55 everything really positive well he'll
25:57 give a guide that's gonna be sober the
25:59 whole time and make sure you'll have a
26:00 bad trip if that's what you want to do
26:02 you can just sit there totally sober if
26:04 you want grab the notebook in the pin
26:07 because you are the Machine now there's
26:12 a catch though there's a couple ways you
26:14 can do it you're gonna come in with a
26:17 photo album now if your family and your
26:19 friends all those people you love or if
26:21 you're capable of doing it you invite
26:25 them into the department and you sit
26:28 with them a friend a spouse a partner a
26:32 relative someone that makes you feel
26:35 good so that you can have the thing that
26:39 you're sensing in the room if you can't
26:42 manifest it out of a photo or out of the
26:44 out of theater out of your mind honey
26:47 remember what was like you have your
26:49 first Christmas so your first Hanukkah
26:51 your first Kwanzaa whatever it is and
26:56 you opened up your first present you're
26:57 like oh my god Santa brought this to me
27:00 oh my god
27:01 magic is real write it down what are you
27:05 feeling
27:07 when something went right in your life
27:09 what did you feel and then when
27:10 something went wrong what was missing
27:12 what were you deprived of when something
27:15 went wrong such that you could actually
27:16 autumn eyes in your life that something
27:18 did go wrong probably love for something
27:23 you loved succeeding and now you're not
27:25 succeeding
27:26 he was succeeding in a relationship it
27:28 didn't go your way or someone betrayed
27:30 someone just a little bit doesn't it to
27:32 be a huge catastrophic moment you're
27:34 gonna continue with this relationship
27:36 and rebuild your trust and whatever it
27:37 is for a moment there was a disturbance
27:40 in the force
27:41 and you felt it and now you're writing
27:45 that down what does that feel like
27:48 in an inner college we have amazing
27:51 creative writing classes and we also
27:52 have amazing amazing literary classes
27:54 and amazing vocabulary classes so that
27:57 you can build up the vernacular and the
27:58 tools verbally to write down what you're
28:01 feeling because a lot of people are
28:03 gonna find it very difficult to write
28:04 down what that feels like they're not
28:07 gonna have words to give it any any
28:10 justice you might get frustrated trying
28:13 to write something down on a book you'll
28:16 find if you ever take a creative writing
28:17 class depending on if you're just
28:19 bursting at the seams to write something
28:21 down or if you've never done this before
28:24 never been created before in fact you
28:26 don't even believe you can be creative
28:27 and this isn't necessarily trying to be
28:30 creative for the sake of being creative
28:32 and we give this little exercise you
28:33 will write junk for a long time it's
28:37 different for everybody you'll just kind
28:40 of yeah happens to me when I do designs
28:43 for people in Photoshop I do their logo
28:45 or I'm designing something for them
28:47 packaging for a product or something
28:49 like that
28:51 first few things you come up with
28:53 sometimes they're just junk and you just
28:54 sit there for hours drawing and drawing
28:57 and drawing and throwing everything away
28:59 and then eventually just about the time
29:01 you feel like giving up poof the
29:04 universe goes okay we just wanted to
29:05 make sure you were actually dedicated to
29:07 this because the person who's asking you
29:08 for the service really needs your
29:10 service and then poof if you're writing
29:17 words the words start flowing and it
29:19 feels good
29:20 you start getting equipped your guns
29:25 full of its ammo which is your mind and
29:30 then you start laying down the principle
29:31 concepts of what you're feeling very
29:33 very coarse emotions that everyone in
29:37 the room is writing down on that first
29:39 moment when they start to be able to
29:40 transcribe what love really feels like
29:42 what is love in the first place right
29:45 it's an intangible thing but yet it's
29:48 the most tangible thing isn't that
29:51 bizarre oh you must don't like that
29:52 stuff
29:53 we like an electron to be right there
29:55 it's there it's not there it's there
29:57 it's not there we like that you like and
30:00 you know uncertainty to be non-existent
30:03 fact factor in the way that we analyze
30:06 the universe so what ends up happening
30:09 is that you start building the
30:10 foundation of your thought process just
30:13 like a house you start building a
30:16 paradigm of thought rules barriers the
30:21 extents of your consciousness the
30:23 constraints might show up maybe not
30:26 maybe you remove all the constraints of
30:29 what love might have been indoctrinated
30:30 in your mind to be it always shocks me
30:35 when I hear people's tell me that they
30:36 lived in a household that never said I
30:38 love you
30:39 because it happens a lot more than I
30:41 ever thought I grew up in a household
30:45 that was extremely like that now the
30:47 dudes were definitely not running around
30:50 I love you man I love you I love you
30:52 that that happened but it was sort of
30:55 that bro
30:56 sort of methodology but the opposite sex
30:58 always told the opposite sex they loved
31:00 them you told your mother you love them
31:02 you told your grandmothers you love them
31:04 aunts and uncles but till the nephews
31:07 and nieces respectively so there might
31:13 be a student that comes in it's like man
31:14 I really wish I knew a lot more about
31:16 love but what I find is that the people
31:18 who are deprived of love go one of two
31:20 ways they go completely empathetic and
31:24 live for love because they didn't get
31:26 any or they grow hard and there's their
31:31 cup never has a single drop in it
31:33 they're not half-empty they're not
31:35 half-full they're empty empty empty zero
31:41 but now imagine we had a language and we
31:44 had a school that adopted this entire
31:48 detection mechanism and you could come
31:52 into that school as early as you want
31:54 cuz we're nominee age limits why would
31:56 there be an angel limit
31:57 can you write in the book can you autumn
32:00 eyes the feelings doesn't matter if
32:02 you're seeing it as a four year old five
32:03 year old you're spelling all the words
32:05 weird maybe it's just a dictation
32:07 recorder a dictaphone
32:09 because you can't write yet I got you
32:12 another school other classrooms to get
32:14 you up to date on how to spell and speak
32:17 but you can tell us when you feel good
32:20 and when you feel bad and what makes you
32:21 feel good and what makes you feel bad
32:24 unfortunately I hurt my first two rare
32:27 silly Apple on the box there's a massive
32:29 tunnel right down the middle so let's
32:32 take it one step further the school runs
32:36 for 20 years is building up steam the
32:40 world is finally acknowledging God as a
32:42 true living being in a fabric of the
32:45 universe now what God is we'll still be
32:51 probably extremely frustrating at 20
32:53 years of research even though we've now
32:55 gathered millions and millions of notes
32:57 and and transcribed all those little
32:59 books into some sort of database where
33:02 we can put machine learning on it and
33:04 figure out what the hell we're all
33:05 talking about to correlate like-minded
33:07 comments to sift up to the top the
33:12 biggest epiphanies that man is having
33:13 regardless of age perhaps the four to
33:16 ten year olds are coming up with the
33:18 most profound definitions of God whereas
33:20 the indoctrinated and closed-minded
33:22 ult's are struggling to come up with a
33:24 thimbles worth of useful comments but
33:29 we're making progress the older people
33:31 are perhaps learning from the younger
33:32 and vice versa
33:33 perhaps a little tiny phrase out of
33:36 someone who's 50 gets the six-year-old
33:38 to go to the next level and really
33:41 spread this or expand this paradigm in a
33:45 way that we're all like oh my god
33:47 it's amazing see I just said it I always
33:51 preach creativity on this show for
33:54 multiple reasons but one of the biggest
33:56 reasons is it will bring you closer to
33:58 the universe / God it will it's hard to
34:03 tell a scientist who's never written
34:05 anything creative down
34:06 besides you know perhaps the real
34:09 clinical novel I was I can there was a
34:11 oak table when I grew up my grandfather
34:14 always smoked that cherry tobacco pipe
34:16 and it smelled good in the room and
34:18 those kind of clinical books that don't
34:20 really have any depth to them to talk
34:24 about your own life is not that hard
34:27 making it interesting is infinitely
34:29 difficult - paying on who you are as a
34:31 human but the reason why I push
34:34 creativity on you guys and try to get
34:36 you guys into creative endeavors which
34:38 is why have a screenplay series in this
34:39 shell if you just look at the playlist
34:42 but I have one on being an artist and
34:44 you know the theoretical definition of
34:46 being an artist and the the avenues
34:49 which you might go down but it's only
34:52 from my perspective but the main reason
34:53 why is that as you become creative you
34:56 start to draw from this river of
34:58 knowledge that philic a dick talked
35:00 about and you start to realize that the
35:03 universe is on you constantly it is
35:05 excited about your dedication to
35:08 creating something because what does the
35:09 universe do it creates constantly now
35:14 you might say it destroys at the same
35:16 time it creates but that's still
35:17 creation the caterpillar is destroyed in
35:21 order to make the butterfly what I write
35:26 and I've said this recently this season
35:28 but I'm going to say it again because
35:29 it's huge it's absolutely huge and it's
35:32 right on target for this river of
35:34 knowledge which for me is sort of seeing
35:36 the blood stream of God the blood stream
35:39 of the universe I've said it several
35:41 times everything is in the universe that
35:43 you need to know you merely need to
35:44 write the query to the universe to get
35:46 the answer which is why if you do not
35:48 think for yourself and you use the
35:50 queries written for you by the deep
35:52 state you will never ask an intelligent
35:54 question for as long as you live these
35:57 high school science teachers who teach
36:00 you know
36:01 global warming big bangs black holes oh
36:03 they feel smart but they're just
36:06 regurgitating crap and you could take
36:09 him down in a body slam of intellectual
36:11 town-hall meeting in front of the world
36:12 on national television on international
36:14 television in two seconds you would take
36:17 them from hero to zero for the rest of
36:19 their lives until they started what
36:21 thinking for themselves asking the right
36:25 questions writing a better query when I
36:27 write a film it is the most profound
36:30 thing you will ever do I guess if I
36:33 wrote novels it would be the same thing
36:34 I'm sure Stephen King has the exact same
36:36 thing every writer on earth probably has
36:38 the exact same thing there's a Twilight
36:40 Zone I believe in season 1 I think it's
36:42 the finale of season 1 but it's the
36:45 episode where the gentleman talks into a
36:48 dictator dictation unit which is what
36:50 Rod Serling used when he wrote the one
36:52 the little tiny reel-to-reel a little
36:54 case because it's 1959-60 technology and
36:59 he said you know these characters create
37:02 themselves sometimes and he starts
37:04 whatever he says comes real which was
37:06 the twilight zone which is cool when you
37:10 write a great story a real story and my
37:14 distinction is if I'm trying to write a
37:15 story and I'm not letting the universe
37:17 in and I'm not getting the vision from
37:19 the universe then it's crap and it
37:21 doesn't really exist I'm trying to do
37:23 something maybe to showboat to myself or
37:25 to some other person which I haven't
37:27 done in ages but when you really find a
37:30 true story it writes itself it exists in
37:32 your mind and it comes through and
37:36 you're writing typically if you're good
37:38 now you're big catches that you will see
37:41 it so complete in your mind you will
37:42 forget to write down enough descriptors
37:44 and enough words to actually communicate
37:46 what you're seeing there's a limit to
37:48 the amount of words you can use in the
37:49 script before you start boring a reader
37:51 so you have to play that game and on a
37:53 book you can go nuts so you can talk
37:55 forever and ever and ever and ever who's
37:56 talking and King have proven now I I've
38:01 said this I'm not trying to pump myself
38:03 pump any crap on you when I wrote Ron 3
38:07 after reading the canceled script at
38:09 Disney which is complete crap just you
38:12 know I mean it is like
38:14 utter crap these characters fell on my
38:17 hand when I take Sam back into the
38:20 computer the posse he runs into wrote
38:23 itself it just simply existed in a room
38:26 and I went wow who are these people
38:28 and I said oh wow that's super creative
38:30 oh wow yeah of course that guy would
38:32 exist Eliana of course these two dudes
38:34 would be friends cuz he's really strong
38:35 and he's a totally geeky nerd guy he's
38:38 got all the tech knowledge and he's got
38:40 all the defence knowledge of course they
38:41 make a perfect pair but there's a scene
38:44 in my act three
38:46 I write for act play a format where one
38:50 of the characters dies I've said this
38:53 before if you read the script it's on
38:55 the Facebook locked Facebook group he
38:57 needs to download and read it that first
39:00 time I told the person my girlfriend
39:02 actually at the time that this was
39:04 occurring she nearly cried at the table
39:06 she literally had to hold back her tears
39:08 I watched her eyes go glass and it was
39:11 like wow and I just realized that this
39:15 was the case this is what needed to
39:17 occur but guess who told me that this
39:21 person needed to die the person this
39:25 fictional character who lives in another
39:27 universe came up to me while I was
39:31 writing and he sort of was like can I
39:35 have a word with you when you're done
39:36 writing out you don't finish what you're
39:37 writing but it'll come to me you guys
39:39 talk to me before you leave this screen
39:41 writing software you're in and it was
39:45 like in my mind I said yeah what's up
39:46 and he said I got to tell you something
39:51 and you're not gonna like it
39:53 I said were you talking about and he
39:56 goes I have to die that's my purpose in
39:59 this script I must die that's the big
40:01 value I bring to give everyone a
40:04 dimension at that moment that he dies
40:06 you find out who cares about him and how
40:08 much they care about him everyone cares
40:10 about him who's on the good side one guy
40:13 carries a lot more than the others when
40:16 it kicks off a whole nother event which
40:19 should have everybody crying and getting
40:22 goosebumps at the same time at my
40:24 opinion he told me he had to die
40:28 not me I fought him for two weeks for
40:31 two weeks is like nine and then a u2
40:33 who'll man your one everybody loves and
40:35 he's like exactly that's why I have to
40:39 die I was like son of a [ __ ] sure
40:43 enough when I figured out where he's
40:46 wanted to die and how he had to die and
40:48 what that was gonna do to the script he
40:52 was right and I have to say when I wrote
40:56 it I was not I was crying inside man I
41:01 was like oh my god you know he's not the
41:04 only one that dies you know it was
41:08 interesting when I got to there's
41:09 another character that passes away in
41:10 the script at the end and I played some
41:14 music from the Tron soundtrack Tron
41:17 Legacy soundtrack and it's called the
41:19 overture and right towards the beginning
41:21 it is like the most if you put it in a
41:24 death scene it is like the most tear
41:26 jerking music you've ever heard in your
41:28 life if you're seeing what I'm seeing
41:30 what I wrote in this script at the end
41:32 and I cried I cried it for an hour
41:37 writing this scene I mean like not out
41:40 loud but I mean I turns running down my
41:42 face and I was like oh my god and I'm
41:44 seeing this death and I'm seeing that
41:46 the impact impact is having on this
41:48 other character and I'm sitting there
41:51 and I'm just going oh my god and I just
41:54 thought at that point I was seeing the
41:55 life of the script really you know
41:57 happen I was saying this thing could
41:58 really be made because this is really
42:00 this is it this is like the original the
42:03 first two movies never got to this level
42:06 of heartbreak and this one does so do I
42:12 give that examples it says somehow pat
42:14 myself on the back not at all
42:16 i when I am engaged in a creative
42:21 situation especially in screenwriting
42:23 because this is a story of human
42:25 condition my skill set is to deliver the
42:30 human condition in so many iterations in
42:32 so many different spectrums at the right
42:34 time at the right pace that I'm trying
42:37 to make you have these feelings but I
42:38 have to get you to this point I have to
42:40 build you up to the
42:41 of the turn so that you feel what I want
42:44 you to feel and that's why writers are
42:47 writers I am sitting in the sofa in the
42:51 university detecting love detecting God
42:57 in my opinion and so a writer who can
43:05 sense that for me or not they
43:07 acknowledge it or not or have the the
43:09 open-mindedness to get out of the
43:11 engineering side of the world and into
43:12 the spiritual side of the world there's
43:14 actually living right on top of God's
43:15 pulse on his on his wrist you know so
43:19 what would happen if society were to
43:21 operate from this perspective as being
43:24 endorsed to by a university this this
43:30 cliche of authority all right as soon as
43:35 the university says something's real all
43:36 the Housewives and whatever guys in the
43:39 world they they just go man is real now
43:41 why is it real well I read it in an
43:44 article that big fancy University says
43:47 it's real so the Big Bang is real hmm no
43:51 need for evidence right
43:52 oh they got evidence oh do they really
43:54 well I know they do why because if they
43:57 didn't they wouldn't write it in their
43:59 journals they wouldn't write a ton of
44:00 books to sell it Barnes and Nobles they
44:02 wouldn't make movies that are based on
44:03 it oh yeah really there's a whole bunch
44:08 of life you haven't lived there brother
44:11 how many of you have ever thought of
44:13 world peace as it relates to war and
44:16 disagreements between cultures and
44:17 societies and you have that sudden
44:20 epiphany well geez if I get everyone on
44:22 the same page either through the Day the
44:25 Earth Stood Still or the brainstorm
44:27 machine we could all just go oh my god I
44:29 thought you hated me
44:31 I thought you didn't allow me to have my
44:33 religion there's some religions that
44:36 don't want to allow anyone else to have
44:37 a religion more than we'd like to count
44:40 on a single hand but if people realize
44:44 that perhaps they're all going for the
44:46 same goal
44:46 maybe they relax a little bit maybe they
44:49 don't do their jihad [ __ ] their
44:53 Sharia law kill everyone is not only
44:55 Guus primitive caveman [ __ ] minds
44:57 right I think one of the greatest
45:00 paradoxes for man is to finally
45:04 acknowledge and discover your method for
45:07 detecting God and you put a little extra
45:10 thought in it and you say okay I believe
45:12 there's a God which means potentially
45:15 there is a set of rules for this
45:17 universe common law is beautiful
45:21 do no harm we have to assume that God
45:24 would have created that law for himself
45:27 and perhaps for us but then hmm we have
45:32 to eat things to survive the wild kills
45:37 and we're wild to weed meat because as
45:41 we're made out of keeps us full the
45:44 eight proteins and amino acids that were
45:48 constructed of and so we stay young
45:51 looking and smart so people try to evade
45:56 that through different eating habits to
45:58 become very ill but they also don't
45:59 acknowledge the plants are alive and so
46:03 they end up creating another form of
46:05 death for one of the oldest life-forms
46:07 on this planet called plant life if the
46:11 Apple falls from the tree and it's not
46:13 going to go anywhere why not pick it up
46:15 and eat it
46:15 well some people do that that's a pretty
46:18 good idea but you can't live off apples
46:20 really sorry I want to go to deep down
46:23 that path but it's true we live in a
46:25 paradox of needing to kill to survive
46:29 hmm well then maybe through other
46:34 paradigm shifts and expansions of the
46:36 mind we realize the death doesn't really
46:38 exist what does that mean we go around
46:42 killing everybody no and why is that
46:44 because we are interfering with other
46:45 people's love cycles love loops all
46:50 these videos coming out with cows
46:51 playing with balls out there in the
46:54 field yeah man they're pretty damn
46:56 sentient they're having fun with the
46:57 ball they're playing catch with their
46:59 farmer buddy
47:01 well for the cows that yield milk I live
47:04 in a pretty good life for the ones that
47:06 come up with our livestock for meat not
47:08 so much try to make it as painless as
47:11 possible
47:11 so once you detect god you're running
47:14 into a paradox love existence until you
47:18 realize one thing if you finally
47:22 discover God for yourself whatever that
47:24 definition might be typically again it
47:27 is one of an omnipotent knowledge and
47:29 one of complete participation in the
47:32 creation process of this universe
47:34 including its design and its substrate
47:36 being ether particles for me might be
47:39 something else for you it is fed by a
47:42 different force though that gives it
47:45 context and life in sentient being which
47:48 is love and consciousness consciousness
47:51 and love might just be very well the
47:52 same thing how do you know your life
47:55 because you can love that's why you know
47:58 your life again we see love and all
48:02 things even plants they love you make a
48:06 good thought towards a plant lives a
48:08 great life water it but don't give a
48:11 [ __ ] about it and it's gonna go you know
48:12 what I'm gonna reincarnate someplace
48:15 else see you later man yeah those 10
48:18 cactus plants you bought cuz they look
48:19 pretty in your apartment all shrivel
48:21 away and die but now let's let's take it
48:28 one step further and start integrating
48:30 the two paradigms does the body have
48:36 electronics in it hmm I think the answer
48:41 is yes
48:41 is it binary yeah yep it produces energy
48:50 power if all atoms are simply photons of
48:56 various ether winds moving at various
48:59 velocities and orbital patterns it's all
49:01 the same thing hmm
49:06 then we're built out of everything that
49:08 everything else is built out of we're
49:11 just a different Lego final product your
49:14 Millennium Falcon and
49:15 Death Star but we're still made of Legos
49:19 okay and if we can sense love can this
49:26 microphone sense love can this cement
49:29 that's under my feet right now since
49:30 love hmm
49:32 how would we know it doesn't have any
49:36 speech capabilities I can't walk
49:39 we can't move it has to do what I told
49:41 to do because it's been squished into a
49:44 form that isn't humanoid it's not a
49:48 living being it's not an insect or a
49:50 fish or plant does love negate matter
49:58 simply because it doesn't have a form
50:01 that has all these instrumentalities
50:04 don't know
50:05 one of my buddies told me back in the
50:07 90s he goes I believe this coffee tables
50:09 just as alive as I am it took me
50:12 completely off-guard I never heard that
50:14 before it was a paradigm introduction to
50:17 me 20 years later eyes told him that he
50:19 said then he as I did and I don't even
50:20 know if I believe that now it's really
50:22 funny how that happens right what if we
50:26 were both obviously we're both really
50:30 when you think about it what does that
50:33 mean do we have responsibilities because
50:36 we're both hmm interesting
50:39 not sure what are our responsibilities
50:44 in the first place it's not exactly part
50:47 of the charter of this conversation but
50:50 it's one that you get to when you go to
50:51 the next level well what do we call it
50:58 when we do something wrong in this world
51:00 through the paradigm of religion little
51:03 three little word called sin supposedly
51:07 it's based off of an Egyptian god rate
51:08 set or whatever is sin is something of
51:15 ill intent where you create a state
51:18 change in the universe of spite or hate
51:21 jealousy self-absorption and you hurt
51:26 somebody else
51:28 hmm there was uh there was enough for
51:32 everyone to eat something but you took
51:35 two and so later down the line someone
51:37 only gets one but you palm the other one
51:39 and you lied hey who took two and you
51:43 don't fess up because you already -
51:45 first one and you're saying I only got
51:46 this one
51:47 so I'm kid down there's bawling his
51:49 brains out because he didn't get any
51:51 there are people like that
51:54 private Pyle who snuck the donut into
51:57 the to the barracks during his bootcamp
52:03 prioritized himself over all the other
52:05 soldiers because he was a disgusting fat
52:08 body as the sergeant would say the drill
52:10 sergeant if we become completely
52:14 self-aware and we become aware of a God
52:19 because we acknowledge that we are the
52:21 machines that detect his or her
52:23 existence
52:24 I think obligation becomes something
52:27 that manifests itself art in front of
52:30 you you become obligated to behave does
52:34 man want that obligation well I think
52:40 when life is good man is willing to be
52:42 obligated with all kinds of good things
52:43 but when life is bad man rejects all
52:46 responsibilities because man is
52:47 overwhelmed with the chaos or the
52:50 chaotic nature of what it is to be alive
52:55 and at that point when you find yourself
52:57 losing grip with your morality because
52:59 you finding it difficult to maintain
53:01 your morality due to the noise around
53:04 you then you want to lose your religion
53:08 as fast as possible because you do not
53:10 want to guilt to be a part of your life
53:13 I think some people take their own lives
53:16 because they feel so guilty about
53:18 something instead of realizing okay
53:20 you're in a bad pocket it's going to get
53:23 better the fact that you know you're
53:24 doing something wrong well that's the
53:26 first sign that you can fix something
53:29 now I just watched a horrific interview
53:32 with this some serial killer in 1991 and
53:35 some interviews Whedon pushed all over a
53:36 YouTube of course you can see that crap
53:38 but you can't see a conspiracy video
53:41 well this guy talked about all of his
53:43 family issues and how if he hated his
53:45 mother he'd go off and kill someone and
53:47 basically he realized later in his life
53:50 he's taking it out on innocent girls
53:53 well that's a guy that was actually very
53:57 very brilliant and very very smart but
53:59 he wasn't in control I don't know what
54:03 would have helped him don't know I'm not
54:06 that person he had all this empathy for
54:10 his mother he understood why she was
54:12 behaving the way she behaved towards him
54:14 I mean at meticulous level of detail
54:16 very cognizant very wise but still on
54:21 that genius State of Mind which I think
54:24 the guy really was sort of the tail
54:25 leading itself right insanity and genius
54:27 eating itself he became a murderer he
54:33 parsed the entire emotional spectrum of
54:35 what he did and the post-mortems of
54:37 everything that he did and how after he
54:40 did it he was good for a couple weeks
54:41 and then it would crawl back on it it
54:43 was just gut wrenching to watch
54:45 sickening to watch the this chaos can
54:49 create such a broken mind but he was a
54:53 sociopath because he looked like a geek
54:54 he was a big guy and so this comes back
54:59 to the idea that you should treat every
55:00 human being as you would want to be
55:02 treated or at least love them like you
55:05 know Fred Rogers said love your neighbor
55:08 and yourself if the huge epiphany at the
55:13 end of the game is to find out that
55:15 Jesus were all made of the same thing we
55:19 all are struggling and the only thing
55:21 that we do is we pretend to have our act
55:23 together hmm
55:26 maybe that's a sickness that we all have
55:30 not sure had a remedy yet besides just
55:33 opening up the book Fred Rogers mr.
55:38 Rogers right he said that you know the
55:42 big reason why he started his show was
55:45 that all the psychological evaluations
55:48 of children that began in the 50s to
55:50 finally realize that children are really
55:52 super sentient
55:53 beings and not these things that just
55:56 make a bunch of noise and eat your food
55:58 and breathe your air and once they
56:00 realize that these these were fragile
56:01 beings that had such a an incredibly
56:04 lucid experience as a youth I mean they
56:07 take everything in ten times as hard as
56:08 we do as adults right because we're all
56:10 hardened or cynical we expect life to
56:13 suck because that's what the deep state
56:14 told us and they create that world for
56:16 us but a child is trying to believe in
56:19 magic and trying to believe in goodness
56:21 until they have that destroyed could be
56:23 on the first day of their sentient life
56:25 could be ten years in when dad loses his
56:28 job starts drinking leaves the family
56:32 whatever when I was a kid it was I don't
56:39 know there just wasn't a big barrier
56:40 between me and a jock me and a nerd me
56:44 and the mutts who moved in from out of
56:46 town he's lived in five towns already
56:48 and the kids only 14 years old and he's
56:49 like man you know it's like my parents
56:51 don't even care what happens to me I
56:54 went up I talk to these kids there was
56:56 always something we could find in common
56:58 and they got a little bit of relief I
57:01 was one of them eventually I was the
57:05 geek I was also the cool kid
57:07 it never was really much of a jock like
57:10 to play sports but his thought was
57:12 really boring I like to have my mind
57:15 stimulated but I can never stop feeling
57:19 the love and humanity and another human
57:23 being and so when I meet someone is like
57:26 well they're just as real as the next
57:27 person I really like you know like I
57:29 have best friends I really like I know
57:31 why I like them so if I meet someone
57:34 brand new it's like they're no different
57:35 than my friend who needs love to feel
57:37 like he's cool or she's cool let's see
57:40 you treat people equally
57:42 I'm always touting our Facebook group
57:44 and their bunch of guising girls who I
57:50 think they're pretty well evenly
57:52 distributed I wouldn't say it's 5050
57:54 between the sexes but it's a lot better
57:55 than the statistics on these videos I
57:57 have like 4 percent females watching
57:59 these videos and that's the whole kit
58:02 and caboodle since 2014 but I think
58:06 they're all in pathetic
58:07 empaths on the Facebook group I guess
58:11 the kind of people that reach out to
58:12 join it besides all the fake profiles
58:15 from foreign countries the spy profiles
58:19 I think one of the logical questions we
58:23 run into when we start to sense God's
58:25 existence through the acknowledgement of
58:28 love and its infinite complexities to
58:31 motivate us to do things in life as we
58:34 start to wonder are we ever going to
58:35 meet this person this being is there
58:39 gonna be a relief is there a green room
58:40 after we come off the stage of life
58:42 duplicate to relax a little bit can I
58:46 not be reincarnated right away
58:48 can I just relax it's gonna be heaven
58:50 you know this pearly gates with a big
58:52 wall around it or Peter's like you don't
58:55 get in do you get in you get in you know
58:57 hmm what would the difference of meeting
59:01 God be from what you're doing right now
59:05 what's it gonna be I myself do not feel
59:11 really smart enough or enlightened
59:15 enough to have a conversation with God I
59:17 would find that to be infinitely
59:20 intimidating and no matter how much I
59:23 might have a beautiful deep thoughts
59:25 moment with God I realized that he or
59:28 she would be probably utterly bored to
59:31 death unless God lives in his own
59:33 constraint bubble forbidding himself at
59:37 least in in the conversation with me to
59:39 know everything you know he reduces
59:42 himself to some human-like creature some
59:47 some George Burns from the movie Oh God
59:52 maybe he's just a user that's coming
59:54 down inside the computer and when I say
59:56 well if you're a user everything's been
59:58 according to a plan and he looks at me
60:00 and goes you wish that's what I like
60:04 about the movie Tron from 1982 it was
60:08 one of the most brilliant things that
60:11 Stephen Lewis Berger did in the script
60:12 you could see how the programs would
60:20 thank to the users who
60:21 them were infinitely intelligent you
60:25 could see it happen and when Jeff
60:28 Bridges character goes down Kevin Flint
60:30 goes into the computer and eventually
60:31 has to reveal to Tron in the third act
60:33 of a three act play that he was a user
60:38 and you know the program's first comment
60:42 was well if you were user then this has
60:43 all been according to a plan
60:44 determinism all right makes sense to me
60:49 doesn't it does it make sense to you why
60:51 program would think that about a user
60:54 was isn't out what we think about God
60:58 hmm so there's chicken and egg question
61:01 that comes with that epiphany which is
61:03 did God come first and then the universe
61:07 or was the universe always here and God
61:09 is merely the culmination byproduct of
61:12 its existence that he perhaps has to
61:16 heathrow particles to exist as well plus
61:18 the undetectable love perhaps God
61:23 doesn't burden himself with a physical
61:25 form and lives purely in the spiritual
61:26 form in that love that we sense as the
61:30 machines built in his image but we all
61:34 know that that built in his image uh
61:36 sure of Mormon is potentially just a
61:40 spiritual image and not a physical image
61:42 the Mormons can handle it they can't
61:44 handle the fact that God could be purely
61:46 spiritual they have to have God be you
61:50 know Michelangelo's God reaching out and
61:53 touching Adam's finger all right it
61:56 won't matter as soon as they pass away
61:58 and they find out they're three
61:59 celestial realms of existence and Jesus
62:01 and the devil don't exist they'll come
62:03 around pretty quickly
62:04 we all will whenever we find out what
62:07 Evers have to this world we'll all come
62:09 around pretty pretty quick what I find
62:12 very fascinating it and some of you are
62:14 deep divers into philosophy and you
62:15 found philosophers that have attempted
62:18 to split this atom and perhaps have done
62:20 a great job please send your references
62:22 if you can is that we don't have these
62:27 conversations that often do we I mean
62:29 really I try to have these conversations
62:32 from time to time in the smoke lounge
62:34 and I
62:35 we'll tell you that I've no matter how
62:37 intellectually deep I find my friends to
62:39 be some of them are going to go for it
62:43 it's probably 1 in 20
62:45 well actually sit down and even remotely
62:48 attempt to have this conversation but to
62:51 the degree they haven't parsed it
62:53 already they feel ignorant in the
62:54 conversation and thus don't believe in
62:56 their responses as being intelligent
63:02 enough for their own liking and so they
63:05 simply shut down the conversation
63:06 through a drifting digression into
63:09 something else oh look what's on TV oh
63:11 did I tell you I went to the gas station
63:14 today diverting away from the pain of
63:17 potentially failing in a conversation
63:20 that has no scorecard in it its episodes
63:23 like these that make me realize for my
63:27 own sake too we're babies in this
63:31 universe when it comes to paradigms when
63:34 it comes to belief systems we are living
63:37 in a little scared child's world aren't
63:41 we and the more we get old some people
63:44 get more and more afraid you know for my
63:46 friends that that are so looking forward
63:49 to death you know I told you that
63:50 episode I'd haven't aired it yet
63:54 actually [ __ ]
63:55 hey want to do that because then I'm
63:56 obligated to get the other one out first
63:59 but they get more and more terrified of
64:01 death as they get closer to it when
64:04 you're a kid you don't worry about death
64:05 that much I mean you don't you don't sit
64:07 around standing in front of moving cars
64:10 so you have a matter you have you know
64:13 of an amount of instinctual
64:14 self-preservation but you're not
64:15 thinking about the huge spiritual
64:17 implications of death and potentially
64:19 not existing so you don't really have
64:21 the concept to fear it but as you get
64:24 older and your paradigms open a little
64:25 bit it's interesting how the mind opens
64:29 and the heart races you become more
64:32 feral as you contemplate your impending
64:36 doom no one gets out alive as they say
64:39 rain I beg to differ I beg to differ
64:44 I love the caterpillar and the butterfly
64:49 I think that's it's an amazing thing
64:53 caterpillars depending on what kind of
64:55 person you are can be perceived as
64:57 fairly cute bugs life did a pretty good
64:59 job with it but everyone thinks a
65:03 butterfly is beautiful don't they
65:05 because they are like little flying
65:08 snowflakes unbelievable the Meadowlark
65:10 is just one of those beautiful
65:12 butterflies and they're harmless they
65:15 don't bite you so they could land right
65:17 on your hand and all you want to do is
65:19 just like get your face as close to them
65:20 as you possibly can to see how they're
65:22 cleaning up themselves you'd like to see
65:25 them eat and fly around and mate do all
65:27 this fun stuff right and so it's a
65:30 luring it draws us to its very being and
65:33 then mankind discovered the genesis of
65:36 the butterfly
65:38 the caterpillar crawls up cocoons
65:41 himself and metamorphosizes into this
65:44 other thing and according to man there
65:50 could be no metamorphosis for the man
65:52 being alright the homo sapien sapient
65:56 into anything else when we cocoon we go
66:00 into a casket and we go into the ground
66:01 or we go into a furnace and we burn
66:03 ourselves to ashes and then we spread
66:05 ourselves everywhere why can't we become
66:08 a spiritual butterfly burdened by no
66:13 flesh living in a pure spiritual form
66:18 now as much as we want to believe in
66:20 ghosts and seeing spirits I haven't seen
66:23 a ghost ghost in my life where I'm
66:27 looking up and I see an apparition of
66:29 light photons being changed in this
66:32 world so I could see an apparition
66:34 there have been videos that are pretty
66:36 convincing but they're just videos who
66:39 knows there's all kinds of people
66:40 messing around with special effects so
66:43 I'm gonna you know some student gridding
66:45 a hoax but in my mind's eye I've seen it
66:50 I've totally seen it I think what I'm
66:54 seeing is a spiritual being someone is
66:58 able to pierce my consciousness in a way
67:01 that they can take on in
67:03 a form that I knew them as at least in
67:05 historical books to see them as they
67:07 were as they choose to be seen and so
67:11 that for me is extremely real having a
67:15 grandmother visited me and tell me she's
67:16 gone too you know
67:17 two hours later found out she passed
67:19 didn't know she was on the edge of her
67:20 death by the way I did ask my mother
67:23 about my grandmother's life last couple
67:25 years of her life and I will tell you
67:27 that I unequivocally did not know
67:30 anything about my grandmother's passing
67:33 in terms of the last two years of her
67:36 life when she was struggling at a
67:40 profound level to keep track of reality
67:42 because she was suffering from dementia
67:45 this particular grandmother never
67:47 challenged herself beyond raising kids
67:49 and so by the time she was in her
67:51 fifties she was done raising all of her
67:53 children and lived this weird loop I
67:57 mean she could have been a host in
67:58 Westworld and no one would have visited
68:00 her much because all she did was cook
68:03 clean do the laundry maybe have coffee
68:07 with the friend maybe play bridge it was
68:11 a loop a very very tight loop and so she
68:14 never used her mind she never solved a
68:17 problem and so her mind went very
68:19 quickly in her late 70s as opposed to
68:21 the ones that I know in Hollywood that
68:23 are in their 80s you know still
68:26 functioning as designers if you use your
68:30 mind just like a muscle if you don't use
68:33 it you lose it but if you do use it who
68:36 tell who knows man you be that 97 year
68:38 old guy lifting you know 100 pounds
68:40 steel things into a back of a truck and
68:42 driving off so I'd be interested in your
68:46 Epiphany Zinn this particular area I
68:50 think we're the machines were the
68:53 detectors we've been built ironically to
68:56 sense God's existence but we have been
68:59 so dumbed down that we went from a
69:02 atomistic life of believing that God was
69:06 with us constantly to a pluralism
69:09 version of you know God being in another
69:12 realm were here and then Christianity
69:15 came by and
69:16 monetized it and said you want to get
69:18 there you better do what we say give to
69:20 the church confess prayer all these sins
69:22 when we say go on a crusade go and kill
69:24 everybody and by the way for about a
69:26 thousand years we're going to kill
69:28 anybody who says they don't believe our
69:29 paradigm mmm it's a one of the world's
69:33 the way it is I want to take a second
69:37 here because I've touched on this a few
69:39 times I've had a little bit more time to
69:40 think about it because I want to be very
69:42 explicit and what I'm trying to do on
69:44 this particular show again I've been
69:47 criticized
69:48 I think constructively by some of our
69:50 listeners and comments that say you know
69:52 look you're always picking on
69:52 Christianity especially any belief and
69:57 Jesus and that sort of thing and you're
69:58 right and you know when I watched this
70:04 episode 44 and season 1 the new
70:06 remastered version I mentioned something
70:09 that I haven't mentioned and I said it
70:10 very clearly in that episode which I
70:12 need to repeat here one goes through the
70:14 episode after this one you'll enjoy it I
70:16 think but God has been made into a
70:19 completely man-made God and that's the
70:22 only way we're ever going to accept God
70:24 until we grow up together this infantile
70:26 level of false intellectual 'ti and so
70:31 the reason why I'm pushing you guys to
70:33 at least consider for a second and try
70:35 to envision for a moment your entire
70:38 life without paradigms of religion the
70:42 only one I really know with any level of
70:44 intimacy is Christianity I didn't grow
70:46 up a Jew I didn't grow up an Arab I
70:48 didn't grow up but anything else so it's
70:50 what I have but when I ask you what year
70:53 it is and you say 2019 that is a
70:55 Christian answer about a fake guy named
70:58 Jesus so you're really really if I ask a
71:02 Jew what ear is it the Jews gonna say
71:04 2018 ask an era what night way year is
71:06 it now there's a few places in the world
71:07 that supposedly used other calendars but
71:10 good luck opening a bank account you
71:12 know good luck withdrawing money that's
71:14 transferred
71:15 good luck signing a contract with
71:16 writing without writing the Christian
71:19 folklore dude 2019 down which is you
71:25 know 2019 years after his death
71:29 and someone quoted technical
71:30 technicalities to me about the exact
71:32 year whatever it's a Christian paradigm
71:35 so it's super duper embedded into every
71:38 human being that grows in this world we
71:42 have to take from things the things that
71:45 are good and leave everything else
71:46 behind because if we don't we're gonna
71:50 have a bunch of anchors on our brains
71:52 dragging us to the bottom of the ocean
71:54 drowning in these paradigms of closed
71:58 mind cynical thinking of of paradigms
72:02 that basically tell you who's good and
72:04 who's bad who deserves to die and who
72:06 deserves to live again as long as a
72:10 religion promotes do no harm then we can
72:12 allow it into the paradigm system of
72:15 human belief right but Sharia law is
72:20 nothing but do harm it's all do harm
72:23 every [ __ ] last millisecond of its
72:25 existence is do harm zero tolerance for
72:29 other religions women are complete
72:30 objects and there's a million ways to
72:33 get your head cut off that's a man to a
72:36 man that's not my world man I don't
72:41 think that's the world that we're
72:43 talking about that we detect when we
72:44 stop and listen and write down what we
72:47 think we feel about love and God I'm not
72:51 trying to be right and make you wrong
72:54 believe it or not I get no joy from it
72:58 okay I grew up a Christian I got
73:02 baptized that 19 years old a very
73:04 sentient smart kid
73:06 and I still went down that path I
73:09 studied Christianity as much as I've
73:12 studied software engineering men and I
73:17 still managed to escape it but if I'm
73:21 ever good to another human being I
73:23 learned it from Christianity so am I
73:27 saying throw the whole thing out
73:28 absolutely none but take it for the
73:31 metaphorical truth that it is if you try
73:34 to say well does that mean God didn't
73:35 write the Bible well God wrote
73:37 everything if I ever write a film and
73:40 you read it and you're like well this
73:41 part sucks
73:43 what you were seeing is my writing when
73:46 it sucks when it's great you're seeing
73:48 the universe writing it's my opinion you
73:53 don't need to go through man to get to
73:55 God trust me if you came to our
73:57 University and you sat down on one of
73:59 those plush beanbags and I gave you a
74:01 book to write into and you're good at it
74:04 you're one of the top scholars you're
74:07 going through books every half an hour
74:08 because you're writing so much however
74:10 you do it and I come to you I say look
74:14 do you think you need a confessional to
74:17 get the gun give me like what are you
74:20 talking about I'm sitting in the bosom
74:23 of God right now I am an expert at
74:26 transcribing on paper the love that is
74:29 God and you're asking me if I need to go
74:32 through man to get to God
74:33 hell no hell no do I need to go through
74:37 any man to get to God I've never been
74:40 away from him and that's what I just
74:41 realized by writing down all this God
74:43 sensing stuff this love sensing stuff
74:47 you can go home to a puppy dog or a cat
74:50 and you get your love cup filled by them
74:55 you know your dark empathy from other
74:57 people's experiences drains out and
74:59 you've just like oh man every set gonna
75:02 snap with my little pet here and I come
75:06 up to you go
75:07 are you with God well no I'm just with
75:10 my cat and my dog you won't say that if
75:14 you really understand what you're
75:15 talking about
75:16 of course you're with God the whole time
75:19 I think one of the worst definitions are
75:22 the worst belief systems that you can
75:24 have and this is going to sound
75:25 counterintuitive but hear me out when
75:29 someone starts defining heaven which is
75:31 really a Christian thing I mean you know
75:34 herbs have the bunch of screwing and he
75:36 Arabs and the Arab world you just have a
75:39 bunch of sex with virgins out there
75:41 which i think is pretty funny hey it
75:44 could be good be taking virginity is
75:48 what God wants you to do alright
75:49 whatever but if you start thinking about
75:52 heaven I think there's no faster way
75:56 and no faster way to hate the present
75:58 and to hate this world tend to grow
76:01 fondly and love what the definition of
76:03 heaven and it becomes this this is what
76:07 Christianity does to people in my
76:08 opinion and religion in general but
76:10 mostly Christianity because heaven is
76:12 such a place you need to go and so your
76:14 whole life here is this tumultuous
76:16 existence to commit the the maximum
76:21 amount of sins you can commit without
76:22 losing your privilege to heaven if you
76:26 have a you know a priest over you
76:28 reading your your last rites in the
76:29 hospital where you're totally cleared of
76:31 all that serial killing you did and
76:33 whatever you did that was horrible
76:35 and so you're clear but your whole life
76:38 sucked up to that point because you
76:40 never acknowledge the fact that you were
76:42 in the bosom of God your whole life you
76:46 see how dangerous that is you think
76:50 these things are positive but just like
76:52 we always talked about the satanic
76:53 rituals they reverse things they sell
76:57 you the bill of goods they make you
76:58 worship your demise if you worship
77:01 Christianity in its purest form I think
77:05 you're potentially worshiping your
77:06 demise because you're separate from God
77:10 needing a priest who touches kids to get
77:13 back to God or get to God in the first
77:15 place really you might say oh there's
77:17 just a few priests in their world to do
77:19 then and you're probably right but they
77:23 protect their own don't they and where's
77:25 God striking him down hmm
77:28 for those that I think the Second Coming
77:31 is going to happen in their lifetime
77:32 which is so many Christian friends of
77:33 mine everybody dies disappointed it
77:36 didn't happen or they start going to the
77:38 through the kubler-ross
77:39 you know anger denial negotiation
77:42 acceptance on their deathbed well you
77:44 know it was gonna happen and our you
77:45 know it'll happen right after I die you
77:47 know some weird thing my advice is let
77:51 go let go let go hold back ascend over
77:57 this this infantile definition of your
78:01 creator and allow your Creator to truly
78:04 breathe in this omnipotent infinite
78:06 universe that you exist in
78:10 because if you never do it once before
78:12 you die you've never done it once you've
78:16 never lived in his world once I want you
78:20 to live in it once at least before you
78:24 go I want you to live in it honestly
78:27 from the moment you realize that this is
78:29 an epiphany for you for the rest of your
78:32 life and I hope you had live a long
78:34 beautiful life outside of this man-made
78:37 thing called religion
78:40 we all have religions we have religions
78:43 about how we take baths and showers and
78:45 how we treat people let that be the
78:48 religion that you constantly
78:50 meticulously alter until it's perfect
78:53 anyway I think you feel me it's 4:30 in
78:57 the morning roughly my neighbor just got
79:02 up and left so I think I better go
79:04 inside let me know what you think in the
79:08 comments thank you for the suggestion
79:11 this is how it works you suggest this
79:15 was an easy one when I read it I was
79:16 like oh my god well I haven't had done
79:18 this episode before touched on a little
79:21 bit but this is brought on point right
79:25 anyway if you haven't been to deep
79:27 thoughts radio.com please go there's all
79:29 kinds of links up there that should keep
79:30 you entertained first and foremost you
79:33 can change your feed so if you're coming
79:34 in through video you can change the
79:35 audio if you come into audio you can
79:37 change the video just depends on where
79:38 you are and what's float your boat
79:39 there's a locked Facebook group we keep
79:42 it locked to keep out all the robots I'm
79:44 constantly pruning fake accounts please
79:47 answer the question when you join which
79:50 asks you you know we'll say something
79:53 human you could say anything anything
79:55 remotely intelligent three or four words
79:58 some people just write I'm human
79:59 boom you're in people don't write
80:02 anything there's some of you I let in
80:03 but it's because I can track your
80:05 account soon as you as soon as you ask
80:09 to join you have if you don't say
80:10 something human if you live in a foreign
80:12 country I'll just kick you out because
80:14 all these foreign countries are part of
80:16 the five eyes and they're trying to spy
80:17 on our group I'm sure there's plenty in
80:19 our group
80:21 but if your have an active profile page
80:25 and you forgot to say something I'll go
80:26 over to your profile page because we
80:27 don't have a lot of requests I'll look
80:29 around make sure you're posting
80:31 something real I just see a bunch of
80:34 pictures you're out forever
80:36 you get blocked you never get a chance
80:38 to come back in so don't screw up we
80:41 also have a Twitter account in case
80:43 people want to get their feed there it's
80:45 starting to pick up a little bit I
80:46 forget about people retweeting things so
80:48 that actually helps quite a bit we have
80:51 two ways to donate to the show
80:53 monetarily to support the show some of
80:56 you might be asking you know why is he
80:59 asking for money now if you read if you
81:01 listen to my first episodes I'm like you
81:03 know I don't need to do this on a
81:04 monetary thing the main reason is this
81:08 one it's kind of cool for me to zero out
81:11 sticks and zero out the hardware I
81:13 bought to upgrade the show but the other
81:16 cool potential is that if the show ever
81:18 got a big boost someone famous refers
81:24 the show and we get like million
81:25 subscribers really quickly I mean I'm
81:27 being facetious but or if somehow
81:29 freedom of speech is actually [ __ ]
81:31 reintroduced United States of America
81:33 and shadow banning becomes a felony and
81:35 all this other algorithm killing stuff
81:38 that happens on the show which happens
81:40 to this channel like crazy you can just
81:42 see the algorithms when you're an
81:44 engineer like me I'm sitting there going
81:45 oh I see what you do at 400 you yank it
81:48 out of the feet and so it goes up to 400
81:50 pretty quickly and it dies it's amazing
81:52 the only thing that really stimulates it
81:55 as if it's in sort of like that Michael
81:56 Jackson Neverland keyword that's where
82:00 you get a lot of views and maybe the
82:01 maybe it's organic I don't know but it
82:03 feels very manipulated it'll set it a
82:06 particular number it'll be like at 423
82:09 and it just sits there for almost a day
82:11 but I'm getting tons of comments on the
82:13 video so I know people watching it so I
82:15 know that the stats are aligned to us
82:17 about the viewership that could be their
82:19 technique to is just to keep it down
82:21 but if the show ever took off how cool
82:24 would it be where I could pull down a
82:27 living salary off the show and do this
82:30 like crazy blow up the production value
82:32 hire a few folks maybe
82:34 you guys out there and gals to help me
82:36 edit the shows it's been a dream of mine
82:39 to have one person in Southern
82:41 California that I can actually sit
82:42 across the table and go I'll get you the
82:45 episodes you know in some dropbox
82:48 because they're about like they're about
82:51 40 gig off this off the stick here when
82:54 they're in 4k on average get to the
82:57 thing we go over the rules of how to
82:59 edit the show and I could just pound
83:01 these babies out and they could be three
83:03 or four it could be every day I mean you
83:04 know it's but it'd be three or four a
83:05 week you know I think that'd be really
83:07 cool so the reason why I turn on banner
83:10 at only almost the episodes is that it's
83:14 for that potential now for the shows
83:16 that are really old that are super
83:18 popular like the moon ones I have turned
83:20 on pre-roll ads because I'm watching
83:22 pre-roll ads on absolute crap episodes
83:24 on YouTube and we watch them and we get
83:27 through them I always go with this
83:28 skippable ad not the pre-roll non
83:31 skippable ad so you guys can at least
83:32 get through it in four or five seconds
83:34 so that's why I'm turning it on so we
83:37 have PayPal and for just donations
83:40 straight out donations and we've got
83:41 patreon which is a monthly subscription
83:43 thing you can put a buck in if you get
83:45 into patreon what's cool is you get the
83:48 episode links the second eye down are
83:50 upload them to YouTube so they're not
83:52 even fully uploaded yet and you get the
83:54 URL so at about 4 hours or so you get
83:57 the whole thing
83:58 season 1 there's a link up there for
84:00 season 1 again X I said you're gonna be
84:04 able to see a lot of videos you haven't
84:05 seen if you're in Europe the cool thing
84:07 about season 1 is I've cleaned up the
84:09 intro the outro and balanced all the
84:11 audio and so you can set your volume go
84:14 to bed with this chirping in your ear
84:16 and you hopefully will get your mind
84:17 blown when the music comes on at the
84:19 very end so I picked some pretty cool
84:22 music for it so hopefully that works for
84:24 you guys as well but anyway that's all
84:27 take care of yourself and someone else
84:29 and I'll see you in the next deep
84:30 thoughts over now
84:32 [Music]
