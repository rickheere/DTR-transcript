00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today as you can tell we're
00:35 going to talk about dreams and we're
00:41 going to talk about the sort of the
00:44 beginning of dreams and the end of
00:45 dreams and for me again if you've just
00:52 came to the show come to the show in the
00:54 last I don't know 20 episodes you
00:56 haven't seen any dream episodes you
00:57 haven't gotten back to the backlog then
00:59 this will be new for you if you're into
01:02 dreams so I have a whole dream sweet
01:05 dream playlist you can find it on the
01:10 YouTube channel or you can just go to
01:11 the website deep thoughts radio comm and
01:13 click the dreams category and they'll
01:15 take you to everything the funny thing
01:21 about me not doing more dream episodes
01:24 is that I feel like I'm sort of living a
01:27 double life and I'm not telling you guys
01:29 about it because when I go to dream when
01:32 I go to bed and I dream these worlds are
01:35 getting as they get older more and more
01:37 realistic and more and more amazing and
01:40 I feel as if I am leaving this area of
01:45 the world
01:46 I never go offworld I really I mean I've
01:48 only had a couple dreams and I won't
01:49 recall them so you don't to hear it
01:51 again where I've been off of Earth never
01:54 in space I've been to the future of the
01:59 world of this world pretty damn sure it
02:01 was the future of this world but every
02:04 night I'm going off to these amazing
02:06 adventures and I'm they're incredible I
02:08 mean I bore my friends to death with
02:10 them if they'll listen and then I come
02:14 back and they get up and it's one of the
02:17 most it's probably the toughest thing
02:23 about me getting up I don't have a
02:24 problem getting up because I'm tired
02:26 most the time I have a problem getting
02:28 up because I'm trying to discern which
02:30 reality I'm in I'm like oh oh yeah it's
02:32 this one the bills and pain you know and
02:36 this other one is like very
02:38 interesting but now I said a long time
02:42 ago that I only have one moment in 2015
02:46 in the summer of 2015 with my girlfriend
02:49 that I slowed up behind her we you know
02:53 I had a full day of work I drove in
02:54 North Hollywood we're chilling out we
02:56 went to a concert we came home and I
02:59 called up behind her and then all of a
03:00 sudden just like in the movie Tron
03:02 Legacy of all things when Sam jumped
03:05 into the grid there was a really quick
03:06 effect which was sort of sad because if
03:09 you saw the first film you know tell a
03:11 special effects team they get to
03:13 simulate what it's like to be beamed
03:15 into a computer and it shouldn't be a
03:18 half second thing it should be some wild
03:20 journey like the first film but
03:22 completely updated with these genius
03:24 kids you know but I had that quick flash
03:28 just like it was in Legacy just BAM and
03:30 I'm in a dream it was the only time in
03:32 my entire life ever never happened since
03:35 where I just was awake all the way
03:39 through the transference of me going in
03:42 and it was very digital which was
03:44 interesting but the dreams have been
03:47 having recently and I say recently
03:50 probably the last six months or so have
03:53 been so incredibly vivid they're sort of
03:56 you know powerhouses of ideas and and
04:01 it's just a comforting place it's just
04:03 there's nothing you know heavy duty with
04:06 it there's no big agenda you know every
04:08 once in a while I'll get dragged into
04:12 setting up things like one of the one of
04:15 the most it's not that common okay but
04:19 I'd say over the last 5-10 years I've
04:21 had a reoccurring archetype of a
04:25 musician that I am a fan of and usually
04:29 it's Prince to be honest and he's about
04:32 to do a little concert and it's like
04:34 he's a rookie again but he's not he
04:37 looks like he was when he was a little
04:39 bit older and I'm helping him set up the
04:42 equipment you know I mean that's like
04:43 you know that's the most like it usually
04:45 tasked with anything but I'll tell you
04:47 what the this the
04:51 episode's gonna be about the birthing
04:52 process and the exit process because I
04:54 learned something about it for me aside
04:57 from that one moment but in the past as
05:02 a younger person if I ever had to go and
05:06 do a task if I'm in place a and someone
05:10 said okey you've got to get in the car
05:11 and you got to go to the go back to the
05:13 house that you were just add and go get
05:16 something and bring it back here and
05:18 then you gotta help us set it up then I
05:20 might have to have you go to some other
05:21 place
05:22 I now can do it without losing the
05:27 continuity for the most part of the
05:30 point A to point B to Point C the
05:32 waypoints to get these things picked up
05:34 now the people rotate every once in a
05:39 while while I'm doing that so I'll be
05:41 with one person and what's there's just
05:44 some very interesting emotional
05:46 commonalities with the scene to scene
05:50 breakdown of the script that is my dream
05:53 and you know for me it is thousand
05:57 percent comforting I don't deal with
06:01 major trauma really you know if it's
06:05 trauma I'm usually very excited but I
06:09 just have a really really super strange
06:12 dream the other day last week into last
06:16 week that I have never had in my life
06:18 and it was it was unique which I'll tell
06:21 you about in a second here so you know
06:24 the other thing about talking about
06:26 dreams is I I sometimes just wonder does
06:29 anyone have any interest in it because I
06:31 think when I was a kid I you know we
06:34 would share dreams from time to time and
06:36 you know when you're a little kid even
06:38 though you're little kid maybe
06:39 especially because you're a little kid
06:40 you can tell when your friends are
06:42 starting to lie and so because when your
06:45 little kid you know depending on how
06:47 lucid you are you'll remember a dream up
06:50 to a point and then you stop remembering
06:51 it because you woke up and you didn't
06:53 write anything down I gotta do writing
06:55 it down about 16 if it wasn't like a
06:59 nightmare which I could totally remember
07:00 but
07:02 so I thought that you know maybe you
07:05 guys think I'm filling things in the
07:07 beautiful thing is I can tell you that
07:09 my dreams are almost like vacations that
07:13 I can recall they do seem you know and
07:17 sometimes they seem like they happened
07:19 just a few minutes ago but a lot of them
07:21 seem like they happened years and years
07:23 ago even though they just have a few
07:24 days ago and there's that weird distance
07:28 you must travel with in your mind to
07:31 capture the memories of what actually
07:34 occurred in your dream if I have to
07:37 reach too far I typically don't talk
07:40 about the streams because they for me it
07:42 gets difficult to recall so I don't want
07:44 to come up with some very non sequitur
07:46 bizarre dream that's kind of like an you
07:48 know I don't want to say LSD trip
07:50 because you remember an LSD trip just
07:52 like you just like no more reality
07:55 there's nothing weird about it
07:56 but this dream I had the other day it
07:59 was towards the end of my dream cycle
08:02 because it was getting close to needing
08:04 to wake up and I have to say I don't
08:07 really recall what happened up to this
08:09 last scene this last scene was wild and
08:14 bizarre it was I had been playing World
08:18 of Warcraft because I was getting my
08:19 flight and if any of you don't know
08:21 anything about what I'm talking about
08:22 it's playing a video game at a
08:24 meticulous level for days and days and
08:27 days to get a bunch of accomplishments
08:30 in the game so that they'll release the
08:31 ability to get on site get on top of
08:33 your your animals that can fly so you
08:36 can really have freedom in the game
08:37 right it's all about freedom man but in
08:41 that game they have a lot of it's all
08:42 islands and ocean and you know coasts
08:44 and it's just like Hawaii the whole
08:46 place is like Hawaii at least the
08:48 expansion and so maybe that's what drove
08:51 the terrain but while I'm there in my
08:54 dream I was on a coastal beautiful
08:57 Hawaiian sort of bahamas looking coast
09:00 it's daytime of day it's I'd say it's
09:04 about 3 or 4 o'clock in the summertime
09:07 p.m. so it's got a good Golden Hour sort
09:11 of coming around and I'm out there
09:13 swimming just very shallowly in the
09:16 and it's not real ocean with waves in
09:19 salt water it's like a still lake type
09:21 again ocean which I guess is more like
09:24 the Bahamas were they don't have giant
09:27 crashing waves in certain areas
09:28 I haven't never been to Bahamas I don't
09:30 know but my friends to sail the water so
09:32 still and you can see the ground I was
09:35 helping a friend I was like having to
09:36 swim out and grab something they were
09:38 like you know go get that thing and
09:39 bring it over here so I'm just kind of
09:41 swimming on the surface and at some
09:43 point there was like some pirate ship or
09:47 something maybe even two and my friend
09:50 was like oh my gosh they're coming you
09:53 know help me get this stuff together
09:54 because we're gonna use this to get rid
09:56 of them which is a bunch of different
09:57 bosses and World of Warcraft not think
09:59 about it but I got myself pinned between
10:02 two pirate ships ahead swim out to them
10:06 and it was fairly fast swimming because
10:08 it's not real swimming of course and I'm
10:11 out there and then they kind of squeezed
10:13 these two ships together and then I'm
10:15 like oh god I got to get out of here
10:16 before these holes you know crust me in
10:18 between right and so I had this sort of
10:23 Superman power of flying in the water
10:26 where I could just simply will a
10:28 direction and then I would go right and
10:30 I was submerged under water I would say
10:34 five to ten feet so had plenty of water
10:37 over my head it was very bright inside
10:40 the water because it's pretty close to
10:41 the edge but you know waters always got
10:43 a bit of a sort of refraction in it so
10:45 it's kind of it's kind of you know semi
10:49 muddy looking not quite but you know
10:51 it's definitely not clear water but I
10:53 could see the you know the Sun coming
10:55 down through the water and I start
10:58 willing myself to go as fast as possible
11:00 in this water then so far it's a dream
11:04 that sounds pretty normal right but I
11:07 start going so fast in the water and I
11:11 can feel it on me which is a real
11:13 strange thing because you're feeling
11:16 your sense of touch and dreams is very
11:19 easy for me at least it's very kind of
11:22 stop and go it's kind of like you most
11:24 of time I don't have it I think I have
11:27 it but I don't
11:28 but I really felt like I had it in my
11:30 hands as I said in several dream
11:32 episodes before I don't usually really
11:35 have hands you you will your hands to do
11:38 things and you sort of think you have a
11:39 body but you really do you really don't
11:41 you know at least I don't excuse me I'll
11:45 even have dreams where I realize the
11:46 entire time I'm in the dream I've
11:48 actually been laying down in the dream
11:49 but since my body doesn't exist even
11:52 though my legs would have been in front
11:54 of me I dream my legs standing straight
11:57 up but I have the definite sense of
11:58 relaxation as if I'm laying down but I
12:02 got going so fast in this water then I
12:05 realized I had completely escaped those
12:07 ships and I'd probably overshot where I
12:09 had started in the ocean in the first
12:11 place and now I'm trying to stop and I
12:14 can't stop in this water
12:17 I don't know technically how many knots
12:19 I would have been going but it was
12:20 mm-hmm
12:21 Brian about 40 knots or so very fast for
12:24 a human body to be going and I can't
12:26 stop so I keep reaching out pushing the
12:28 water kind of like you know wait a
12:30 minute I'm Superman here sorta I'm not
12:32 Superman with s on my chest but I've
12:34 definitely got this aquatic I guess I'm
12:35 Aquaman more than anything and I can't
12:37 slow it down and I remember just sitting
12:40 there for 10-15 seconds which is an
12:43 eternity when you're in a panic
12:45 situation and it wasn't like panic to
12:48 the point my heart rates going up and
12:50 I'm in an unhealthy situation it was
12:53 just I got to stop I have stopped this
12:56 [ __ ] so I'm pushing and pushing and
12:58 pushing and pushing and finally got to
12:59 stop but then I woke up and you know it
13:06 wasn't a situation where I had to go the
13:07 restroom my brain is going wake up wake
13:09 up wake up because you get to go pee or
13:11 something
13:11 no that's fine it was a good hour to
13:14 wake up but it was just me having
13:18 instigated a situation that I couldn't
13:20 stop which is the unique archetype of
13:22 that situation a lot of times in dreams
13:25 things occur that you don't have control
13:27 over and then you're just subjugated to
13:30 it until it quits right but the thing I
13:34 think that we all experience with dreams
13:36 I mean you tell me if you have anything
13:37 different that is really odd is that we
13:41 don't have a birthing
13:42 in dreams they just start and they tend
13:47 to start mid program and I think that's
13:52 very very interesting because it it it
13:58 sort of indicates how the brain or the
14:00 soul is incurring this alternate reality
14:05 and once you start refining your
14:08 definition of reality such that you know
14:12 reality is simply your most popular
14:13 illusion then I think we do have to say
14:18 the dreams are absolutely another
14:20 reality and we're not getting as much
14:24 out of dreams I think as human beings
14:25 because we have been taught to poopoo
14:28 dreams right just ignore that energy you
14:31 just had a dream whatever in to the
14:34 point where I think a lot of folks
14:35 ignore dreams so much they don't have
14:37 them anymore and when I look at the just
14:42 the most basic fundamental thing that I
14:44 get out of dreams I think that's sad
14:48 that what I'm getting out of dreams no
14:50 one else is getting out of dreams I've
14:51 got friends of mine that don't dream but
14:53 they're brilliant people I don't know if
14:55 it's fluoride I don't know what the deal
14:57 is now the exit out of a dream you will
15:01 remember the exit of a dream because
15:04 typically the reason why I remember the
15:06 exit of a dream is that something is
15:09 going wonderful something is great I
15:12 like of my most lucid dreams I've ever
15:15 had in my life
15:16 it is the lucidity that I'm experiencing
15:19 that I recognize I'm in a dream I think
15:22 it's super cool but now I'm in complete
15:25 control of the dream and the thing is my
15:28 my goal when I become lucid is not to
15:33 control anyone else necessarily at all I
15:35 don't think I've ever tried to do that
15:36 my goal in a dream is to explore that
15:40 world in a lucid mind to say oh my god
15:44 I'm gonna I'm in a dream world my brain
15:47 either created this or this is a reality
15:50 and it's very fluid and look at that
15:54 house right over there listen
15:56 go in the front door look at that big
15:58 building let's just go in there I wonder
16:00 if this is there so as you start
16:02 wondering your brain will start creating
16:03 stuff it's pretty funny a lot of times
16:06 the romantic encounters that I have will
16:09 force me to get up it's interesting
16:11 because I'm enjoying that romantic
16:13 encounter but more recently I've had a
16:16 few of those and I didn't wake up I kept
16:19 going and when I woke up and remembered
16:21 that I was able to completely start and
16:25 end a romantic engagement someone you
16:28 can just fill in the blanks that that
16:33 was a progression in my ability to stay
16:36 in a dream state I didn't panic I didn't
16:41 hit lucidity sometimes that well I can't
16:46 really say that that makes me lucid or
16:47 anything but definitely has been the
16:51 byproduct of being lucid and what's
16:54 interesting about dreams is that once
16:57 you realize you're having one you
17:02 suddenly realize that you can do
17:04 anything and you really won't
17:06 necessarily be hurting anyone I've never
17:08 attempted to hurt anyone a dream that
17:11 was just a normal dream person the only
17:13 time I ever get into a pain situation is
17:17 if I'm having a fun die hard dream you
17:20 saw the die-hard archetype all the time
17:21 I'm in a building with friends and
17:24 whatever and someone's invading the
17:29 building you know they have broke
17:32 through the they're trying to get to the
17:33 through the doors downstairs and all of
17:36 a sudden I have a weapon and then it's
17:38 sneaking down and killing them you know
17:41 we're trying to I've had alien invasion
17:43 dreams which you know a few of the alien
17:48 invasion dreams I've had an alien dreams
17:50 where we're in some dispute with aliens
17:51 are so vivid that I could describe them
17:54 right now as if they just happened a few
17:57 minutes ago but they're years and years
18:00 old
18:01 it's amazing how sometimes these things
18:03 stick in our minds it's it's more than
18:07 seeing a movie because you're in it
18:09 I've been on a military base lunch which
18:11 was a coastal military base it's totally
18:13 fictional and these aliens were landing
18:16 on the coast and they looked really
18:19 weird man and they were formidable as
18:22 [ __ ] man I don't know maybe like 8 to 10
18:24 feet tall very strange bodies I I think
18:27 I had this dream closer to the release
18:29 of that battle for Los Angeles movie
18:32 where those aliens look fairly strange
18:34 right but hiding from them you know
18:39 shooting at them I mean just the whole
18:41 thing is just no fear at all it's just
18:44 fun it's just like oh my god this is
18:47 cool and I never fear for my life
18:49 which is interesting so what are dreams
18:53 in the first place is revisit the most
18:54 fundamental question which I always
18:56 visit most these episodes because I'm
18:58 talking about this moment where I go to
19:03 sleep and it's some random point in time
19:06 I will first of all I'd lay down right
19:10 and I'm getting my body adjusted my
19:11 breeding adjusted and I slip into sleep
19:14 and here's the thing other than that one
19:16 time I have never remembered in my
19:18 entire life ever actually falling asleep
19:21 he's in that bizarre why is that we do
19:26 it 365 days out of the year you - maybe
19:31 a couple days if you pull us pull an
19:33 all-nighter but overall you sleep all
19:37 the time
19:38 99% of the time every single year so why
19:42 on earth are we having such a problem by
19:45 design not remembering this step off
19:48 moment and please let me know if you do
19:51 remember on a more frequent level that
19:54 threshold moment what's going on you
20:00 know there's all these theories about
20:01 what's going on and you know I respect
20:06 people's attempts these dream scientists
20:09 or whatever
20:10 but now think about it you go to college
20:13 and let's say I don't know what degree
20:16 would make you a dream specialist
20:18 neurology you know neural chemistry
20:22 it's really not suited I mean its suited
20:25 in it's not suited right if you are was
20:29 trying to think of the best way to the
20:33 best way to sort of describe this I just
20:36 don't think that there's a science that
20:39 makes someone an expert of dreams you
20:43 know at best you can write papers into
20:45 your research at a particular University
20:47 using as much equipment as possible but
20:49 the second that you start using
20:50 equipment and engaging in a hypothesis
20:52 god bless you
20:53 you're still you're restricting most
20:57 likely unless you have a discipline to
20:59 study your bias a bias that's going to
21:02 potentially cut off a whole data set
21:04 that will reveal what dreams really are
21:09 if you believe in a soul again not
21:13 necessarily the religion soul but an
21:17 organized pattern of energy that's on a
21:19 different plane of existence that merely
21:22 interacts with this plane it isn't
21:25 anything to do with electrons or ether
21:29 winds of any kind maybe it is but
21:31 probably not something that were simply
21:35 not sensing because we have no machine
21:37 that can sense it and therefore the
21:41 scientists of the world are entirely
21:42 blind to what it could be your soul and
21:47 thus I think potentially the kickoff to
21:52 the dream world now I've said several
21:56 times the different episodes and I still
21:59 think about this all the time and I mean
22:01 it's weird for me to say it a couple
22:03 times in a couple episodes and then
22:05 think about it every single day of my
22:06 life and I don't make an episode about
22:08 it but I really do toy with the idea
22:11 that we are getting our program updates
22:14 while we are asleep maybe it's something
22:19 in our brain which is our physical
22:22 tangible instrument that creates a
22:25 consciousness which we then refer to as
22:27 our mind could be our soul itself
22:30 reconfiguring itself to go
22:33 you know I mean like a little cynical
22:36 lately maybe I should change my attitude
22:38 and attract via the law of attraction
22:41 something more profitable for my
22:44 happiness in life and so you reconfigure
22:46 yourself or you could be going down the
22:50 valley or hey you could be going down
22:52 into the valley and making yourself more
22:54 cynical who knows try to be the other
22:55 way and then you reconfigure yourself I
22:58 made a whole episode about this called
22:59 dream scaping and this is that episode
23:02 is about being able to re-engineer who
23:05 you are as a result of sleep simply go
23:10 to sleep if you're interested in that go
23:11 watch that episode I think you'll really
23:13 enjoy it but it has to do with when you
23:15 go to sleep vision yourself being taken
23:18 away from this plane of existence this
23:21 as a lot of the time travelers talk
23:22 about this realm of time to then be
23:27 escorted to another realm of time that
23:30 is the direct results of your law of
23:32 attraction such as your soul can
23:34 reattach into a version of yourself
23:36 that's going to have a much better time
23:38 it's a much better reality where things
23:41 aren't going bad or maybe you're more
23:44 patient to more understanding maybe even
23:46 just the chemistry of your body is what
23:48 you're changing by attaching to a new
23:49 version of yourself if there's infinite
23:52 versions of you don't worry about taking
23:55 it away from somebody else
23:56 there's a bunch plenty for everybody I
23:59 also can't shake the fact the dreams are
24:04 so detailed so unbelievably detailed you
24:10 know for those of you have ever worked
24:12 in Photoshop or those have you ever done
24:14 scrapbooks and you know the whole JibJab
24:17 thing where they cut you can upload it
24:19 your face and then it creates a dancing
24:21 party of your whole family for Christmas
24:23 and you pass it around all your
24:24 relatives and it's singing the song it's
24:26 just a cutout version of your face
24:27 there's a little Nutcracker thing for
24:30 your mouth and simulates I blink sand
24:32 all this other stuff you know you can
24:34 just cut that stuff out put it together
24:36 that's not how our dreams are created I
24:40 have rarely in my life gone to places
24:44 where I actually there are places that
24:46 are
24:47 real in the real world the most common
24:50 place I've ever gone is my hometown and
24:53 I have two distinct experiences within
24:56 my hometown and what's really strange
24:58 about it is this the house I lived in I
25:00 don't think I've ever had a dream there
25:02 my grandmother's houses of which I spent
25:05 countless thousands of hours at never
25:08 dreamed about those two places but my
25:10 uncle who lived two houses down from he
25:12 had a three-story house or the third
25:15 storey was this really strange kind of
25:17 just attic area but it was so tall you
25:19 could stand up I dreamed that he had a
25:22 study up there that didn't exist I was
25:24 like a really quaint really sort of like
25:27 Sherlock Holmes beautiful sort of
25:31 British I don't know if you would quite
25:34 go Victorian but it would just be
25:36 literally in 1800s 7th late 1700s sort
25:41 of quaint would you know area just very
25:44 ornate lots of fun stuff up there and
25:46 it's it's not even remotely addictive of
25:49 who my uncle was as a human being or is
25:51 scuse me but back in those days but it
25:54 was like a secret place you went up
25:56 there and no one was up there but the
25:57 place was [ __ ] and span he had all kinds
25:59 of cool stuff I mean you would find a
26:01 stop watcher and watch on a fob or one
26:04 of those roll-top desk but it's always a
26:06 really small version of everything
26:07 because it was in this small space the
26:10 other one was seeing my hometown which
26:12 is a very standard Midwest home town
26:16 which looks like Disneyland's hometown
26:18 but real and so you have the storefronts
26:22 and they all go back like 100 feet or
26:25 whatever and that's where they build
26:26 their stories supposed to live above it
26:28 and work down below although no one does
26:29 that anymore on the thing but I would
26:32 dream that that place had been
26:35 retrofitted with what looks like a
26:37 billion dollars with a construction like
26:39 behind those buildings really futuristic
26:41 buildings and like these crosswalks and
26:43 stuff so you could you could just
26:45 socialize and he's really cool I don't
26:48 know art galleries and restaurants and
26:50 it's all real kind of upscale and cool
26:52 just I don't know how that would ever
26:54 happen in my hometown so that's the only
26:56 really - they're my old hometown
26:59 that's the two that I remember and
27:01 that's it and it doesn't hasn't happened
27:03 for years watch me have a bunch of
27:05 Dreams there now
27:06 so most of the places are all brand new
27:09 and for whatever reason in my dreams I
27:13 travel every single dream I travel in a
27:16 car I don't travel that far but I've
27:19 been in a car once and that recently
27:21 I've been in this town and cuz so here's
27:24 what also happens to me which I think I
27:26 mentioned in the last stream of a sudden
27:28 made but I will sort of dream for a week
27:32 or two in this particular town and then
27:36 it's it switches and in the town I say
27:39 goodbye to that town and then the new
27:40 one shows up and I'm in that town for a
27:42 long time and I've got people that I'm
27:44 with and it has a certain vibe just like
27:47 anywhere in the world you like it or you
27:49 don't
27:50 and so before I go to bed
27:53 one thing I've had extreme success with
27:56 and I even forget it works so well is
27:58 that I'll you know I talk to God all the
28:01 time and I'll just if I've sort of worn
28:06 worn out my fascination with the
28:10 particular destination and the people
28:12 that seemed to be there and again I
28:13 don't I don't really remember anyone
28:16 dreamed a dream so I don't have like Oh
28:18 Rebecca is right there and Steve's right
28:19 there and then and that stuff all people
28:21 are new never learning ones names that
28:25 be profound if someone goes hey I'm Bob
28:27 you know I'm Linda you know I that would
28:30 be amazing to have that level of a
28:32 conversation with someone but these
28:34 places are full of real aren't they I
28:37 keep going on and on about this and for
28:40 those of you have heard all the other
28:41 episodes this is a bit of a repeat but I
28:43 want you to really think about that this
28:46 isn't a scrapbook situation anyone who
28:49 wants to insinuate there's all your just
28:51 piecing together a bunch of stuff that
28:52 you've seen it's like that's lame
28:55 that's a lame-ass excuse for what I'm
28:57 seeing I'm seeing buildings from
28:59 whatever perspective that I happened to
29:01 see them at because I travel in like a
29:05 little circle I guess I let me let me
29:07 explain the traveling thing
29:10 virtually every place I am and under
29:14 it's about like the size of a village
29:17 even if it's skyscrapers it's still like
29:20 I'm traveling sort of like if you stayed
29:22 in Manhattan the whole day sort of thing
29:26 I don't venture out into another
29:27 boroughs usually if I do I consider that
29:30 usually in my mind another dream a whole
29:33 different place but that's very rare one
29:35 night I'll have two different locations
29:37 because they easily stick with my
29:38 friends
29:40 stick with the people but I'm seeing a
29:43 building like I'll be in a building I'll
29:45 be up on like the 20th floor and someone
29:49 says well you got to go get that thing
29:50 okay
29:50 oh good that thing down the elevator I
29:54 get in my car that I parked earlier
29:56 still there it's not stolen usually some
30:00 people hop in the car with me and we're
30:02 driving where do I go your turn your
30:04 left oh yeah okay great
30:05 go in there get the thing come back here
30:07 get in the car drive back go up back up
30:09 to Levine I'm back at that floor but the
30:11 whole time we're driving away from the
30:12 building looking at the building coming
30:13 back so it's a bunch of proof that this
30:16 isn't some cut and paste thing and these
30:17 buildings aren't familiar to me
30:19 whatsoever I can still remember a ton of
30:21 them right now let's look at the let's
30:27 look at what happens in a dream for a
30:28 second and then let's look at we'll get
30:32 back to you like this birthing process
30:34 in just a minute but think about the
30:37 fact that you know tell me if you like
30:40 if you know a relative you know that
30:42 that's your friend and that's your
30:43 daughter or that's your dad or whatever
30:45 so those people you do know who they are
30:47 and if you needed to think about their
30:48 name you would have their name on the
30:50 top of your tip of your tongue right
30:52 okay but all the people you don't know
30:56 what's interesting about it is that
30:59 there's no necessity to know who they
31:01 are I mean really get into the details
31:03 where do you live you know it's the
31:04 first thing you do when you're in a
31:05 conversation with a random stranger are
31:08 you here on vacation are you like what's
31:10 going on haven't seen you before no no I
31:12 live down the street you know are you
31:14 from Huntington Beach it was like those
31:15 conversations never happen in my dreams
31:17 personally and there's an interesting
31:20 thing that having had obviously tens of
31:23 thousands of Dreams like you have
31:25 we never asked and it's not important to
31:28 tell isn't that interesting we don't
31:32 need to know if you really thought about
31:35 the real world and you're just getting
31:38 along with everyone around you maybe you
31:41 don't need to know I mean how many times
31:42 have you been in public and had a very
31:44 interesting useful exchange with someone
31:46 and you never got their name that's
31:49 still a great night still great
31:51 interaction perhaps don't ever even
31:52 forget that person because they got you
31:54 a tank of gas or you know whatever or a
31:57 gallon of gas to save your butter they
31:58 helped me change a flat tire and you
32:01 forgot to ask it's in movies all the
32:03 time right
32:04 here's what I would love to know about
32:06 the birthing process are those dreams
32:10 happening even if we're not there I mean
32:13 is that reality on in a particular way
32:17 even if we're not there and so all we're
32:21 doing is coming back to the party your
32:25 soul drifts attached by the silver cord
32:29 when you go out to that reality and the
32:33 reason why it's so fluid I said it's not
32:38 this reality perhaps we're bringing our
32:41 bias to the dream which is that it has
32:43 to have a reality it has Damir the
32:46 reality that you're familiar with
32:47 because you and I can't be in a reality
32:49 of just sound waves or just color you
32:53 know a Pantone chip dream you can't
32:57 understand what the hell that is we wrap
33:00 other consciousness inside of something
33:05 tangible that we can make that we can
33:09 make out my other question is is this
33:14 whole thing maybe all of us am I your
33:21 dream friend are you mine I will say
33:28 having just remembered just now that I
33:32 have definitely had dreams where I've
33:34 met women that I thought were phenomenal
33:37 human beings
33:39 strong super intelligent beautiful and
33:43 will be hanging out in fact when I
33:45 remember hanging out near a sort of a
33:48 beach was just part of a fairly
33:51 developed town maybe was more like a
33:54 river or something but it had just sort
33:57 of a beach scene it was I don't know
33:59 exactly where this place was but I met
34:02 this girl and a group of people and
34:05 we're all kind of marching down the
34:06 street think we're singing songs or
34:09 something or they were and I was just
34:10 chilling up the guy I do singing dreams
34:12 and boy music is amazing and dreams like
34:15 music and dreams is utterly perfect by
34:18 design I've never heard a bad song come
34:21 out of myself or someone else in a dream
34:23 it's like this pure you for place to
34:27 write music but I met this girl and I
34:30 remember sensing the dream was gonna end
34:34 which is weird in itself and you know
34:38 maybe you know maybe wasn't really
34:40 sensing the dream was gonna end but I
34:42 did want to lose this girl she's a
34:44 nobody I mean she doesn't exist
34:45 necessarily and I'm telling her my phone
34:47 number over and over and over again and
34:49 I'm asking her to repeat it back to me
34:52 and I said as soon as you get up soon as
34:55 you go wherever you go call me let's see
34:59 this works Nev funny we're really cool
35:04 start of a some sort of television show
35:06 find out a movie but be cool right you
35:09 wake up in your phone rings and it's you
35:13 know some weird number
35:14 you answer it slowly and there's a girl
35:18 on the other side is this you is it you
35:21 you're like yes Kapow and then she
35:25 doesn't look anything like you think she
35:26 looks
35:28 but now let's take a little exercise
35:31 here just postulating okay that we have
35:36 a home for our souls now we like to
35:42 think about the home of the souls as
35:44 being like a heaven hey call what you
35:47 like it's probably pretty cool it's
35:49 probably pretty great now the context of
35:53 sin yeah I don't even think it exists a
35:56 lot of that stuff is made up so we
35:58 behaved on earth so it'll kill each
35:59 other on earth or violate each other's
36:03 privacy or sovereignty or what-have-you
36:06 okay in a dream world can you really do
36:09 that can you really do that I don't know
36:13 if these are real people perhaps if
36:18 they're you perhaps imagine we create a
36:23 social media website or social site
36:25 shouldn't say media a social site where
36:30 people have a database of keywords when
36:35 they wake up they document their dreams
36:38 they document more so the people in
36:41 their dreams than anything else they do
36:43 talk about you know like in that dream I
36:46 just put forth would be beach community
36:48 side street festival daytime crowd of
36:56 people my thing there we walked all the
36:58 way down to this where the street had
37:00 actually sort of I guess it existed at
37:03 one point but the water had been
37:05 diverted or a river was put through here
37:08 so kind of just went down into the the
37:11 rushing river that goes by and some
37:14 people just go down there and hang out
37:16 you know it's it's like almost like the
37:18 the coastal regions of India where they
37:20 do all their bathing and crapping all
37:22 the same time but you know it was under
37:26 those we were under this overpass and it
37:28 was kind of we went down there and hung
37:30 out for a little while and then we went
37:31 back underneath the underpass and that's
37:33 what I'm looking at her and we'd spend
37:35 some time together we walked over we
37:36 down there together a bunch of people we
37:37 hung out we had a good time and now sort
37:40 of like that summer love
37:41 or you're like oh man am I gonna know
37:43 you after this summer but imagine a
37:46 website where you have you obviously are
37:48 marking the day did you have you know
37:51 problem is cuz [ __ ] lie this thing
37:53 wouldn't work but if we could somehow
37:55 police that then you could have a
37:57 situation where you would find out if
38:01 one of your dream peoples perhaps
38:03 someone else in the world because all
38:07 the keywords come up you know and then
38:09 you contact them through chat or
38:11 whatever and you're like okay tell me
38:12 some more details maybe you have to do
38:14 like an escrow situation where you
38:16 describe your entire dream in escrow and
38:18 it locks I can't change it anymore the
38:22 same other person does the same thing
38:23 and now both of you get a copy of the
38:26 dream
38:27 I think you'd you imagine if two of them
38:29 came up bingo and they're just almost
38:33 identical one of you remembers a little
38:35 bit of something else and you know cuz
38:37 you do look different directions you'll
38:39 see different things maybe the person I
38:43 was with she stayed in there for another
38:44 two hours and experienced a whole nother
38:46 situation some other do I woke up right
38:50 away but now let's say that for a second
38:54 because well let's review because the
38:56 scientists of the world like to say that
38:58 one
38:58 you only have dreams during REM sleep
39:00 all of your dreams happen in a split
39:03 second now we've blown that out of the
39:05 water that is not the truth for most of
39:07 us okay
39:08 that have commented on the show one of
39:11 the other psychologists said well dreams
39:13 are human beings filing away all of
39:16 their short-term memory experiences that
39:19 they gathered throughout the day into
39:22 long-term memory which it's like what I
39:26 hear that and I know about all their
39:27 different theories of where our memories
39:29 are in the body all I think you're doing
39:32 is you're tapping on it's like you open
39:34 the phone box on the side of your house
39:35 and you're starting to mess with all the
39:38 conversation points that you have when
39:41 you have a phone call outside or you
39:42 open up the hard drive you're messing
39:44 with it but it's really a proxy it goes
39:46 out to some other ether all cloud out
39:48 there shouldn't say that word but some
39:52 soul based universe
39:54 it's very nebulous very forgiving and
39:59 not to digress but I want to draw a
40:02 contrast between this reality and a
40:04 dream reality at least as I see it when
40:07 again I had nightmares from probably mmm
40:11 for to like seven badly and then I had
40:16 it relapse at twelve one dream and that
40:20 was it
40:20 so I understand nightmares happen hope
40:23 none of you have them conquer that enemy
40:27 whatever's up in your face I don't care
40:30 if you're the weakest person on planet
40:31 Earth you go and you dominate that thing
40:34 next time you see it you just charge
40:36 right at it and rip it to shreds and
40:38 then your dream your nightmares will be
40:39 over if it ever shows up again just
40:42 crack your knuckles and say you haven't
40:44 had enough Evie just tear it apart
40:46 really you're in control envision how
40:49 you want to tear it apart because it'll
40:51 just happen
40:51 I'm gonna pull its head off crap down
40:54 its neck do it because I'll just in that
40:57 dream be like dr. Detroit if you get
41:02 that reference you get the A+ for the
41:03 day but down this reality man it's it's
41:08 not nebulous at all is it
41:10 it's object-oriented I mean people walk
41:12 up to you things happen it rains it
41:14 doesn't rain whatever stuff happens but
41:17 were if dreams were a reality and you
41:22 were to measure and come up with a
41:23 metric system to say you get these
41:26 things from dreams then this reality is
41:31 sort of like hardcore gritty and it's
41:37 it's extremely restrictive I almost want
41:40 to say the word like it's a prison
41:44 because when you're in this one Boyken
41:47 you can feel pain can't you you can feel
41:49 physical pain emotional pain it's a
41:52 different game on this side now it's not
41:54 that you can have your heart broken in a
41:56 dream but I think it's a little bit
41:59 harder I am pretty lucid in this world
42:03 can't fly can't change anything or maybe
42:06 I can and it's my percent
42:07 I can't they that limits me but I always
42:10 think if if that were the case if man's
42:14 indoctrination into believing that one
42:16 can't fly is the only reason why you
42:18 can't fly then it doesn't explain all of
42:21 the malnutrition homeless people that
42:23 are talking to people and believe
42:25 anything so I'm gonna have been a mental
42:27 institution that truly believes they can
42:29 fly or be invisible
42:31 or whatever so I do believe that there
42:34 are individuals that have accomplished
42:36 one hundred-percent belief system and
42:39 maybe it's the overall groupthink
42:42 world that they live in that they can't
42:45 accomplish it and maybe I don't know but
42:47 whatever when you're here you're here
42:49 man I mean when you're in a dream if you
42:52 wanted to change it I think you could if
42:54 you just lucidly thought I'm done with
42:58 this let's go there boom and you're
43:01 there somehow when I used to stay up
43:05 really really late and again I mentioned
43:08 this book all the time I'm just gonna
43:10 mention it real quick but the book I
43:12 read that talked about the fact that
43:14 when you get tired your right brain goes
43:16 to sleep and your left brain takes over
43:18 and a lot of scientists we're living 32
43:20 to 36 hour days so that they could
43:23 access that amazing creativity of which
43:26 they weren't necessarily brought up with
43:28 because they're scientists and I take my
43:30 hat off to them because good good go go
43:33 find the creativity that you need right
43:35 don't just grab a guitar and mimic stuff
43:38 write your own music you know but my
43:41 question is is this let's just say that
43:46 we had them for the sake of paradigm
43:49 thinking and talking about this we have
43:52 two layers on top of each other and it's
43:57 like bed sheets or cloud cover versus
44:00 being on the ground so we're on the
44:03 ground because of this gravity thing we
44:05 can't just fly up in the air so we're
44:07 here and I have conversations with you
44:09 and we can invent some devices to go out
44:11 there but you know it's not the same
44:14 but this cloud cover area is where the
44:17 dream layer exists and when you fall
44:18 asleep your soul falls out of your body
44:22 and goes to this place on one of my
44:27 exercises I believe is 2015 but I was
44:31 consulting and so I was working at home
44:33 really really late and just I wasn't
44:36 allowed to go into work every day
44:37 because there's a policy I was working
44:39 for the state creating a database for
44:41 this Cal State Long Beach College for a
44:43 friend of mine and so I used to sit on
44:46 my bed it'd be like 4 o'clock in the
44:48 morning or sometimes it'd be like 6
44:50 o'clock at night and I just sat on the
44:53 bed and I'm exhausted man I'm totally
44:55 wasted but instead of just embracing
44:59 sleep I thought okay I'm going to
45:01 attempt to be conscious during this
45:07 sleep birth moment this dream birth
45:11 moment it never worked there was a very
45:15 interesting thing that was occurring
45:18 because the other thing I was I've
45:19 always been curious about is this notion
45:21 of sleep cycles you have a cycle and you
45:27 know it seems like we do
45:28 it's strange like I will try to reset my
45:30 sleep sometimes and you know I'll get to
45:35 bed early and then I'll get up and it's
45:37 that time of day that I would normally
45:39 be asleep I'm still dead tired because
45:42 my body is in some cycle that goes you
45:44 know we should be asleep should we be
45:45 asleep
45:46 we should be asleep right it's like I
45:48 feel like I need a house in Hawaii just
45:49 to go endorse my later you know five
45:53 hour or was it three hours later sleep
45:55 pattern and as I slide out of Hawaiian
45:59 time then I'll come back to America or
46:01 come back to California America geez
46:04 well what I was feeling and I've
46:06 described this one other time but what I
46:08 was feeling quite quite lucidly because
46:11 I was trying to again hang on literally
46:16 inside my mind as I felt my
46:18 consciousness on my pillow right and it
46:22 was distinctly outside of my head it was
46:26 back further into the pillow
46:28 as if it was some symbiotic thing that I
46:32 became aware of for the very first time
46:34 I became aware of my soul is actually
46:38 not completely inside my body but
46:42 because it's intangible to this ether
46:45 based universe which is our Mass on our
46:47 energy
46:48 all in one let's say you actually are
46:52 the same as me and you actually have
46:54 some I don't know like a backpack from
46:58 your from your head down to your chakras
47:00 right just boom boom boom all the way
47:02 down and I can come up to you and I
47:04 could touch that part of your body and
47:06 actually put my hand technically through
47:08 your soul but since it's not disturbed
47:10 by me in any way shape or form you don't
47:13 necessarily feel it but maybe you do
47:16 maybe that's why head massage is so
47:17 amazing and a back massage is so amazing
47:19 it's because it's freeing up more
47:21 control your meridian lines that are all
47:23 clogged up from stress or sleeping wrong
47:26 or whatever get freed up and so it
47:30 starts communicating with the universe
47:31 better there's this amazing feeling when
47:34 you do get a massage that you're sort of
47:37 floating on cloud 9 you know if you
47:39 really get a 90 minute massage front and
47:42 back and you walk out of that place
47:46 especially with somebody else
47:48 it's sort of like you're you're kind of
47:51 a robot you know you're kind of like oh
47:52 my god it's like you're having to
47:55 regress with the reality that you're in
47:57 like this one it's almost like a semi
47:59 dream state during your great massage
48:02 and you feel healthy it's bizarre right
48:08 but I had this epiphany on the day I was
48:12 doing this and I would fall I would
48:15 literally I'm on my pillow so there's no
48:17 further back I can go right but I would
48:20 feel like my head was falling backwards
48:22 even though it wasn't my head was
48:24 actually doing the little jerk kinda
48:27 like when you go to sleep and you kick
48:29 your leg you know that's why sleep
48:31 paralysis is so important man if you
48:33 don't have a chemical secreting to your
48:36 body that puts you in paralysis imagine
48:38 that you walk in your dream you're
48:40 walking in your
48:42 [Music]
48:43 but when I got for the sleep cycle was a
48:46 vision of a like a universe well I so
48:52 sorry sorry solar system
48:53 excuse me and it was sort of like the
48:56 orbit of a sleep if you will almost like
49:03 a sleep planet I am floating and I'm in
49:10 orbit around something my soul I don't
49:14 know it's just it's just a figurative
49:18 example or it's a metaphorical example
49:20 but it was like the planet of sleep
49:22 would come around and I had to get on it
49:25 just like a train coming by that's
49:28 probably better analogy right the train
49:29 comes by and you got to get on it and if
49:31 you miss it you are screwed it goes it
49:35 just it's on a cycle if you miss it then
49:39 you're tired and you're roaming around
49:41 the tracks so you're trying to find the
49:43 next station where it's gonna show up or
49:45 you're just sitting there and it was a
49:48 very interesting thing but I definitely
49:50 got this super 3-dimensional image of
49:52 the fact that my soul my consciousness
49:55 was it was way bigger than my head and
49:58 further back and it's a very interesting
50:01 thing when someone says do you really
50:04 feel your body I mean when you're awake
50:06 do you really feel all the dimensions of
50:08 your body now if you have some pain or
50:11 something like that yeah yeah sure you
50:12 feel your feet ache after going to
50:14 Disneyland or or you've been on a boat
50:17 and it's really windy and so just just
50:20 lying down with no wind on you the boats
50:22 still doing this even though you're in a
50:24 hotel bed now I hear people say often
50:28 that they not many people but I hear
50:32 especially because we have thousands of
50:34 followers I hear these you know folks
50:36 report in man I have lucid dreams every
50:38 night and all I can say is your IQ
50:42 should be so freakin high you know and a
50:44 lot of great game programmers in the
50:46 world have taught themselves how to do
50:48 it and I've talked to you guys about the
50:50 methods I've heard to do it which is the
50:53 most simple
50:54 to do it takes a discipline to do it but
50:58 you carry around like fortune cookie
51:00 type messages not tiny but you know so
51:04 you can read them easily and you have a
51:09 couple of them you put a one at work
51:11 several at home wanted your car and
51:16 they're different but you become
51:17 ultimately familiar with them like
51:19 lyrics in a song and so the way you do
51:22 it is that you train yourself while
51:24 you're awake it'll seem silly which is
51:26 why I never kept going on with it I
51:28 should try it again
51:29 but I'll look over and read the passage
51:33 look away and look back and read the
51:37 passage because in a dream word scramble
51:41 as soon as you look back and it's
51:44 different boom you're in a dream now
51:48 what I have found is that reading
51:49 anything in general you feel dyslexic in
51:52 your dream it's just things almost
51:54 scramble while you're reading them and
51:56 it's like you know but I'm at a level
51:59 now where I have started to develop
52:02 tools of thought that when I wake up
52:07 it's I have to almost verbally say that
52:13 was a dream that was cool I really
52:15 enjoyed that part of it da da da da and
52:18 really cast that experience into the
52:21 dream realm so that I can begin my day
52:23 in this room it's almost debilitating at
52:27 a micro level but it's super exciting at
52:30 a micro level to write that this is so
52:32 vivid so I've been trying to do more
52:34 research with it now the other thing
52:39 that I have noticed in my dreams just to
52:42 add a little bit more research to this
52:43 particular episode is that in the real
52:48 world this world or this reality I
52:51 should say if I met you I would look at
52:54 your face and look at your clothing and
52:56 look at the world in a very distinct way
52:59 I would itemize everything I'm seeing in
53:02 my dream world
53:04 I rarely truly remember
53:08 what anyone looks like even when I'm in
53:10 the dream I usually get the best
53:17 summation of their look from 20 feet
53:20 away now if it's Prince or someone like
53:23 that then I completely remember that but
53:27 most of my dream characters are
53:29 peripheral vision feelings of a person
53:32 it still feels great it's still very
53:35 vivid I might glance at someone's face
53:39 one time but I had a romantic encounter
53:42 like three days ago
53:44 and was weird because it was an old
53:46 friend of mine and so and then she
53:48 texted me the second I woke up how weird
53:50 is that right but I remember in that
53:53 particular dream I glanced at her face
53:56 for a split second the whole time I knew
53:59 it was her but I glanced at her face
54:01 first what second then we spent some
54:04 time together and it was over just as
54:06 fast it started my opinion but I kept
54:09 going and when I woke up I was like I
54:11 didn't wake up as a result of doing this
54:14 very strange it's good it progressed in
54:21 terms of exiting a dream it's
54:25 interesting so the most vivid archetype
54:28 I personally have with exiting a dream
54:30 is if I have to go the restroom and my
54:33 body is trying to get me awake and I've
54:37 mentioned this once before this hasn't
54:39 happened recently which I'm really happy
54:40 about but I guess it's because my father
54:46 was my Disciplinary parent when I was a
54:48 kid my mom wasn't uh I was gonna push
54:52 over anything my father could actually
54:54 do me physical harm right you know my
54:57 dad was cool man ain't he still life but
54:59 he believed in spanking and he you know
55:02 you know like I said he caught me I
55:05 think a couple times where he was
55:07 overdoing it for something that didn't
55:09 actually occur but in the end for the
55:11 times he caught me when I was being a
55:13 little bastard
55:13 I'll take those other two any day and my
55:18 father and I I mean we've gotten along
55:19 forever now I mean you know I we had a
55:22 little
55:22 but when I was in my teens like uni
55:24 meaning parent-child situation comes
55:29 about my dad you know he created a
55:31 really cool household I mean he really
55:33 let me be myself and so I got to do a
55:37 lot more things that other kids didn't
55:38 get to do but anyway what my dream was
55:42 doing for the last probably decade was
55:45 victimizing my father in the dream it
55:48 would bring him in and then all of a
55:49 sudden he and I were in an argument and
55:51 it would even get to the point where it
55:54 almost went physically violent which
55:55 neither my father and I we don't ever
56:00 point any violence at people you know we
56:03 get angry you know he's both of us who
56:04 went through that common phases some you
56:07 know immature guys go through where we
56:09 break items if we get angry usually not
56:11 in front of other people but you know
56:14 that's ancient ancient news but you know
56:18 I would get to these points in the dream
56:19 rocking back and forth and it's
56:21 nonsensical crap meaning it's stuff that
56:23 doesn't really exist it's not pulling
56:25 any skeletons out of the closet that
56:26 really exists between the two of us
56:28 right but it would just get me to the
56:30 point where I'd go POW and I wake up I
56:32 gotta pee like crazy son of a [ __ ] it
56:36 was like I hope her getting up but it
56:38 took me probably half a dozen times for
56:41 this to occur before I started realizing
56:43 look I got to start speaking out loud
56:47 when I wake up from these dreams such
56:49 that I shake off the black Apple there's
56:52 some dream victimizing my dad so I get
56:55 up so that I never attach any of that
56:57 fiction to him and of course moment I
57:01 talked to him today we just have the
57:03 greatest conversation so it doesn't
57:04 doesn't really work that way but I don't
57:06 want even a subconscious thing to build
57:09 up inside me so today it's no big deal
57:11 and it to date doesn't occur I just wake
57:14 up it doesn't have a big violent thing
57:17 happen or you know and just you know the
57:20 dream world is so pure and so blissful
57:23 that even an argument and words seems
57:25 like knock-down drag-out so that's what
57:27 I'm talking about but even when I have
57:30 scary things happen to me in dreams
57:33 but then other than the water thing I
57:35 just talked about that was more
57:36 frustration of like to him and I it was
57:38 kind like what if I Unleashed I can't
57:41 stop moving in this water it was weird
57:42 but I've had some bees breathe on my
57:46 neck because there was cold air in the
57:48 room I'd turned on my heater really
57:51 really low thinking it wouldn't go that
57:53 low and the room I however I rolled
57:58 around I got my neck exposed which with
58:01 long hair is not that easy to do and I
58:03 transferred that cold wind on my neck
58:07 into a zombie breathing on me and it was
58:09 sort of like I'm in the dream and I
58:11 don't have any fear for my safety and I
58:14 thought this guy I might just bite my
58:16 neck because it's right there and I
58:19 can't remember if that's what I thought
58:20 happened I don't think that's so I
58:22 thought I thought had like I kind of
58:23 woke up as a result of it and you're a
58:25 little spooked by something like a
58:28 zombie really existing that's a little
58:30 strange right but you're still kind of
58:32 excited at the same time you're
58:33 terrified it's almost like going on a
58:35 roller coaster that's gonna scare the
58:36 crap letter you know but as of late as
58:40 of the last year my dreams when I wake
58:43 up are very peaceful in most cases it's
58:47 just something that you know and a lot
58:50 of times it's me in the dream sitting
58:52 down on a sofa laying back and relaxing
58:55 and then just foof or wake up but isn't
58:59 it interesting that if you have the same
59:01 sort of beginning and ending where the
59:03 beginning is just a program that's
59:05 already in motion and your exits just
59:09 sort of this benign feathery feeling or
59:13 just who we just woke up you know then
59:17 it seems as though we're floating sort
59:20 of right go back to your soul analogy
59:22 and let's just say there's this
59:23 mezzanine in reality there's souther
59:25 dimension where Souls go to relax and
59:29 just be a soul and it can't help but
59:35 bring the imprint of your reality with
59:37 it because that's what you're engaging
59:40 in and you're still attached to your
59:41 body however that works
59:44 now I have reservations of the notion
59:50 that we actually physically go anywhere
59:52 simply because we envision places that's
59:56 definitely not your bedroom because most
60:00 of us can recall a few hundred times
60:03 where the configuration of the pillow of
60:06 your sheets of the room is affecting
60:13 your dream like in the last year I had a
60:16 dream where I was actually sort of in my
60:20 you know your mummy shape and I was
60:23 floating through the dream seeing things
60:26 occur and I'm talking to people I'm
60:28 saying let's do this let's do that but I
60:29 actually felt my body was laying down
60:32 inside the dream not just not just the
60:37 feeling with the upright body but I was
60:38 actually horizontal in the dream and
60:41 then that when I woke up I felt kind of
60:43 funny but it was sort of an extension of
60:45 my understanding of my dreams because I
60:46 was like wow my mom always told me she
60:49 said that when she dreamed I was
60:51 probably about 9 or 10 I was asking her
60:53 about her dreams and she said well you
60:55 know I don't necessarily control my
60:57 dreams I just sort of float from room to
60:59 room and I I look at things and I
61:01 experience things I have to say I've
61:04 definitely had that dream too
61:06 I think all of us could probably if you
61:09 can take your dreams and put them in a
61:12 sort of category list on this one
61:14 particular metric which is how
61:17 human-like are your dreams one of my
61:22 most vivid dreams I ever had well the
61:26 honestly it's the Prince dreams this is
61:31 after he passed
61:33 especially because obviously is on my
61:35 mind I never got to meet that guy really
61:38 sad but um one of the dreams I was at
61:42 his house I told talked about this one
61:44 time before about am at his house and
61:46 his house is like this really cool sort
61:49 of normal Minneapolis sort of home but
61:52 he had this yeah my family was there my
61:54 girlfriend and my kid
61:56 there and his wife was there I think you
61:59 know maybe maybe his kids were there I'm
62:01 not quite sure but he had some
62:02 bodyguards just chilling out everyone's
62:04 eating food it's not like any you know
62:06 it's a very private personal situation
62:08 and of course he knows I'm a fan so he's
62:13 playing into that well okay let's see
62:15 what you made out of right and he opened
62:18 this um this album sort of look next to
62:25 his sofa and his so his whole house was
62:28 kind of multi-leveled like a little
62:30 stair stepping down but it was all meant
62:31 to be one level like walking wise but
62:34 anyway it's all wood - is really cool
62:36 he opens this thing up and he goes
62:38 there's a bunch of my cuz I talking
62:39 about the vault songs you know I said
62:41 well you know what about all these songs
62:42 you made me oh yeah they're all over the
62:44 policeman and he goes well here's some
62:46 right here and he goes a bunch of
62:48 unfinished songs and he goes why don't
62:50 you just pick one and we'll go finish it
62:53 so can you imagine I mean like I don't
62:55 know pick your favorite band I don't
62:58 know if you know Prince but he had like
62:59 like a thousand unfinished songs and
63:02 they're starting to release him now
63:03 which is kind of cool in sort of the raw
63:06 form you know and unfinished for him
63:09 means finished but not polished and you
63:11 know when you listen to him if you know
63:13 his normal catalogue it's very true
63:15 they're not polished they wouldn't sell
63:17 in the in in normal circumstance if he
63:20 was alive and he said here's my new
63:21 album they're gonna be like it's a
63:22 little raw don't you think but anyway
63:26 I'm in this thing I pick out one of the
63:29 tracks I can't hear anything and they're
63:31 just they're just tracks and I can't
63:32 remember if it was an album or a tape or
63:34 something I tend to think I was thumbing
63:36 through albums but then when I gave it
63:38 to him he played one it was this really
63:41 cool beat and then all the sudden when I
63:45 turned around to the kitchen kitchen it
63:47 kind of transformed into like a mini
63:48 studio but still like kind of a kitchen
63:51 sticking it was really weird but he
63:53 starts and the proximity of he and I
63:55 kind of spread out a little bit like I'm
63:57 on one side of Duty's and the other side
63:58 he's like what would you do and I just
64:01 started singing to this crazy rhythm he
64:05 came up with was very old-school it was
64:08 sort of a kind of an 80s peaceful
64:10 sort of thing and I just started singing
64:14 to it and it sounded perfect of course
64:15 to my brain because you know whatever I
64:17 don't know why that's the case man I've
64:19 sung at least three or four times and
64:23 dreams that I really vividly remember
64:27 and I think the very first time I ever
64:29 sung in a dream
64:30 the dream was that I was in one of those
64:32 sort of Harry Potter libraries with a
64:34 really round room library thing it was
64:37 part of a bigger library but there's
64:39 like this weird little nook in the room
64:40 or the ceiling went up like thirty feet
64:43 and I started doing the Mary Poppins
64:46 thing where I was floating I had drunk
64:48 the fizzy lifting drinks by the way I
64:50 keep quoting the date that Willy Wonka's
64:53 chocolate factory was made and I get it
64:55 wrong every single time it's 1971 that
64:58 movie was made not 73 so apologize for
65:02 filling your mind with wrong factoids
65:04 about that movie it blows me away more
65:07 it's even two years earlier than it was
65:09 anyway I'm floating and I've just
65:13 started to sing and it was harmonizing
65:15 in this room like the echo chamber in
65:17 this room was automatically harmonizing
65:20 and the music was going and I was just
65:22 floating and singing and it was just
65:23 like absolutely euphoric there's all
65:28 these stories about angels seeing from
65:30 heaven and being the most you know
65:32 gorgeous siren song you've ever heard
65:35 maybe that's why maybe it's why you
65:39 can't even create anything but
65:40 mathematical perfection when you're in
65:42 this realm now I want to give you this
65:47 little evolution in my own realization
65:50 of studying dreams and how its improved
65:53 the actual dreams themselves now my
65:58 theory if you haven't heard it yet it's
66:01 about the brontosaurus no it is about
66:04 the idea that why why did we dream you
66:06 know that we were naked in a room every
66:10 human being within reason has had that
66:13 dream it's such a popular dream that
66:19 it's in tons of sitcoms
66:22 it was even in Star Trek once and it's
66:27 because in my opinion that we arrived in
66:29 our dreams as a pure soul then we
66:32 manifest a body second then we manifest
66:35 our clothing third if we think we need
66:38 it and what happens when you're young
66:40 and you're still not comfortable with
66:42 your body which is usually when these
66:44 dreams occur and you could be
66:46 uncomfortable with your body as an adult
66:47 I guess and you should you should test
66:50 whether or not if you're uncomfortable
66:51 being naked around other people you
66:54 might still have these weird dreams or
66:56 you're naked in front of other people
66:57 and you're embarrassed or whatever right
66:59 I only had that when I was a kid and for
67:02 me this is Atiya my information but once
67:06 I got nude in front of my high school
67:08 sweetheart when we decided to go there
67:12 for the first time for both of us um
67:14 that was it I had never had that fear
67:16 again which is so strange this is a
67:18 weird thing to be naked remember the
67:20 people in my opinion but shouldn't be I
67:23 was just think it's a violation of their
67:25 privacy I don't know like if I make it
67:27 in their presence it's a violation of
67:28 their privacy I don't want to see you
67:31 naked put your stuff back on it anyway
67:33 um a little Kent I can't it's not my cat
67:39 but it's the neighborhood cat she's been
67:41 heat poor thing
67:43 I think there's any other cats although
67:45 I've heard her fight with her the kids
67:47 she's chillin it usually she's terrified
67:50 of me for some reason anyway I used to
67:55 dream about my car being stolen a lot
67:57 because everyone you know has that
68:00 little thought every once in a while
68:01 especially if you've ever heard of
68:03 anyone else recently having their car
68:04 stolen there might be in your mind or if
68:07 you really value your vehicle and it
68:09 gets stolen you know in the end it
68:11 really comes down to you'll get your car
68:13 back you whether or not your insurance
68:14 pays for it or whatever it's do you have
68:17 anything in there that's that's valuable
68:18 to you let me think about it you have a
68:20 scratch on your car when you get a
68:21 brand-new one what's so wrong about that
68:23 don't worry about it right but since
68:26 I've started talking to you guys about
68:28 my dreams I've lost that one and that
68:31 used to be a big interrupter was it very
68:34 common but it was at least
68:36 once a year I come out and my card begun
68:38 and now I don't even know if I care
68:41 it used to be that if I had a really
68:43 fancy car in a dream like some
68:45 Lamborghini or something it would be a
68:47 Lamborghini when I got into it or parked
68:49 it and I came back out and it's like you
68:51 know some beat-up Toyota Celica that
68:53 doesn't happen anymore
68:54 I Drive usually in my dreams the car I
68:57 own in real life drive around now does
69:02 it have all the feeling of being in my
69:04 real car of course not it's it's just
69:07 almost like everything's a symbol in my
69:10 dreams you know and I think that the
69:13 most profound element of my dreams that
69:15 I remember when I wake up are the dreams
69:17 or the location of the dreams you know
69:21 these offices and homes and exteriors
69:25 and I definitely will say that world of
69:28 warcraft' definitely bleeds into my
69:30 dreams if I play it a lot if I play a
69:32 match three game on my phone which I'll
69:35 do from time to time that match three
69:40 thing will infect my dream algorithm a
69:43 little bit where I'm instead of just
69:45 fetching something I'm fetching three of
69:47 everything you know it's really kind of
69:48 funny but I'm hoping that by continuing
69:52 to analyze my dreams for our mutual
69:55 benefit and then hearing your dream
69:57 stories that at some point maybe in a
70:02 euphoric sense we will Group evolve our
70:06 dreams to a point where you know we
70:10 start to have more consciousness in our
70:13 dreams thus more rewards more epiphanies
70:16 more value in our dreams right I've been
70:21 thinking a lot and this could be a
70:23 slight digression but it's sort of on
70:25 the same notion of birthing a dream you
70:30 know when you are born into this world
70:32 again they've proven that babies are
70:35 very psychic they've tested them by the
70:38 age of five they've almost lost all of
70:40 it but if you've ever had a kid or
70:44 you've ever helped to raise a child in
70:46 any way shape or form you'll know that
70:48 there are these unconscious
70:49 bounce of crime in a child and you know
70:53 they could be in the most amazing family
70:55 in the most amazing location but they're
70:58 still they're not hungry they're not
71:01 tired and they still will just you just
71:06 kind of see them look around the room
71:07 and they just kind of start crying and
71:10 they're just like what they're saying is
71:11 I'm so [ __ ] bored of this place
71:14 moving around man like you got legs you
71:17 walk around you got me in this car seat
71:19 sitting on the tables like give me up
71:21 moving around and this is where I
71:22 figured out with my little niece they
71:26 said that she was just impossible to get
71:30 calm calm when she would go to her
71:32 crying phase now she's a smart little
71:35 whippersnapper today like crazy smart
71:38 not necessarily academically but
71:41 socially really really brilliant my kid
71:44 was the same way I mean like my kid was
71:45 like like vicious with her brain on a
71:50 social level it's really young age I
71:52 mean she was like lecturing couples and
71:54 stuff like seven or eight year old about
71:57 whether or not they loved each other
71:59 looks like whoa and of course my friends
72:01 were like what are you telling her when
72:03 we're not around I'm like nothing man
72:05 it's like I I've just told her that you
72:09 existed today when I dropped you off to
72:10 watch her for a couple hours write
72:12 really strange but anyway I used to pick
72:15 up my niece I pick her up so she was
72:19 facing straight ahead I mentioned this
72:21 once before but I pick her up and then I
72:23 just kind of you know Bopper because
72:25 that feels good I'm warm so I'm heating
72:28 her up and I got her all bundled up nice
72:30 and man we just start adventuring around
72:32 the house you know and she still every
72:35 once we all start to kind of you know is
72:37 like yeah I don't want to be in the
72:38 living room Jesus do you think that's
72:39 where I want to go and of course she
72:41 wants to go to Disneyland of course but
72:43 that was a few thousand miles away but
72:45 I'd you know walk outside if we could
72:48 walk upstairs we'd pick up things and
72:49 let her look at him and and that seemed
72:52 to just completely preoccupy her brain I
72:56 am pretty much convinced at this point
72:59 of my life through my own delusional
73:00 thinking
73:02 that our previous life is fully in our
73:08 consciousness when we when we were born
73:10 probably while we're in our mothers and
73:12 then we'll were born well who we were is
73:17 completely remembered and I think that
73:20 that probably drives a little bit of the
73:23 oh man I'm in this new body
73:25 I'm with new parents these folks cool or
73:29 are they crazy do they ignore me or do
73:32 they love me and I think that that
73:36 process shakes off over the years of the
73:39 months maybe it shakes out really really
73:41 fast maybe it takes a couple years but I
73:45 think that we potentially have that and
73:48 it's sort of a scary notion to actually
73:51 have that be real if that were indeed
73:52 the case part of me doesn't want that to
73:56 be the case because I don't think it
73:57 would be fair to a new birth to have
74:00 that experience because you're sort of
74:02 deserve the new reality to be completely
74:05 refreshed and of course the beauty of
74:07 birth death and resurrection in terms of
74:10 reincarnation for human beings or the
74:12 soul itself is that all that you have
74:15 accomplished is forgotten at a literal
74:19 conscious sense but the talents that you
74:26 may have manifested in your previous
74:29 life do they I would say store it's sort
74:36 of muscle memory in your soul such that
74:39 when you come back if you are a musician
74:41 in your previous life that music is much
74:44 easier for you in this life and then
74:47 just substitute that for every other
74:48 career or talent you might have it could
74:51 be that you were a chieftain
74:52 I have friends of mine that I thank your
74:55 chieftains I think I'm a chieftain where
74:57 if we were born in a previous era where
75:00 this was a little village and needed
75:01 leadership I would be a good fair-minded
75:05 guide to to contribute my personal
75:08 leadership skills to the elders that are
75:10 already there and then as they die off I
75:13 would take take my position
75:15 others to help lead but it what if it's
75:17 a teeny tiny little clan and you just
75:20 have no one it can think straight while
75:21 you're the one I have a friend of mine
75:24 really close friend of mine that that
75:26 has a little bit of car anxiety but they
75:29 also drive motorcycles and I said well
75:32 how do you feel in a motorcycle I feel
75:34 great
75:34 I don't have any anxiety on a motorcycle
75:36 so that's because you're all about
75:39 freedom your soul wants freedom in that
75:42 car is not freedom it's a cage when
75:46 you're on the motorcycle you're good you
75:49 can get off anytime you want and I think
75:52 that those little tiny subtle tics to
75:55 our absolute core programming / perhaps
75:59 previous experiences dictate who we are
76:03 in this world and what we're naturally
76:05 good at and what we have to learn now
76:08 I'm gonna throw a little humdinger in
76:09 here at the end I've I've thought about
76:13 doing this episode sort of don't want it
76:16 episodes because it's a little dark and
76:17 I don't want anyone to get caught up in
76:19 a feedback loop of this belief system if
76:21 it especially isn't true so I'll just
76:23 throw it in as a little chatzky at the
76:25 end of this episode which is raise your
76:29 hand if you've ever thought that this
76:32 world is a prison I mean I think I may
76:36 have mentioned it once before but I
76:38 mentioned it just in a fleeting passing
76:40 comment and the reason why I say that is
76:43 related to dreams think about a really
76:47 good beautiful dream where nothing goes
76:50 wrong which is most of my dreams so I
76:53 live in a world where I don't worry
76:55 about anything there are no bills
76:57 there's no taxes there's no yeah you
77:01 know you can just be who you are to the
77:03 very core of your being thousand percent
77:07 and then you wake up and you have to be
77:09 something that everyone else wants you
77:10 to be and I don't mean like I do the
77:13 show and you want me to be this person
77:15 and not that but just you have to you
77:19 know we'll put it this way we're in the
77:21 cancel culture world and so even if
77:24 you're like [ __ ] all those people you
77:26 know you do police your words a little
77:28 bit more
77:29 of one thing I don't hear your [ __ ]
77:32 alright I don't want to use this word
77:33 and then you have a [ __ ] [ __ ] fit and
77:35 blow a gasket and it's like man is this
77:38 all your life is made out of is having
77:40 these you know arguments of futility I
77:42 just want to live man leave me alone but
77:46 everyone's up in your game now because
77:48 they're so woke right when you have
77:52 those little pings of how could this be
77:54 a prison you know then usually the
77:58 manmade penal system starts to overlay
78:01 on top of it and you start to think
78:02 about maybe karma you know the the Hindu
78:05 belief of karma which is like man maybe
78:07 I was a dick in the previous life and
78:09 the hardships that I might have in this
78:11 life are related to what I made other
78:14 people experience in the other world you
78:16 know I give you one it's it's my
78:19 personal curiosity now I'm gonna I'm
78:23 gonna sort of put out there a little bit
78:26 of a negative things happened to be but
78:27 I don't want to give you the wrong
78:29 impression I have definitely experienced
78:32 a wonderful life I mean beyond any
78:36 dreams I set out as a child I haven't
78:39 gotten every single one of them but damn
78:40 it it's almost man you know once you go
78:43 to see a movie and my name flub flies up
78:45 on the screen we're done we got it we
78:48 got them all but I really didn't have
78:50 that dream when I was a kid but I've had
78:53 you know like I've said several times
78:55 because of the banker you know cycle of
78:58 boom and bust those boom and bust said
79:01 been right on top of companies where I
79:02 should have been well one the company
79:05 should have succeeded and I should be
79:07 working at those companies right now in
79:09 some cases they're my companies but most
79:11 cases it's someone else's company and I
79:13 just love working with them so you know
79:18 I I video games you know like I work for
79:22 the TurboTax people I was like the sixth
79:23 coder to work on the product that got
79:27 they lost a bunch of money I got bought
79:29 out by another company and eventually
79:30 ended up in Intuit the video game thing
79:33 we had given we had three games but
79:36 because the industry died and tanked all
79:38 three of them got cancelled I made a
79:40 game sold it didn't really make any
79:42 money going
79:43 where I got into pretty much the
79:48 internet boom a lot of database stuff at
79:50 the same time company I was working for
79:52 should have dominated the world poof
79:55 it's out because another company Alps
79:57 spent them with the shittier product
79:59 that was gone so I have these over and
80:04 over and over moments you know working
80:05 for Electronic Arts I had a tremendous
80:07 amount of stock and we're making
80:08 something amazing
80:09 AOL lies boom its Khan right I started
80:13 my own game company it roared for five
80:15 years amazing the economy crashes in the
80:17 third year and it kills the company
80:20 about four years later I had a partner
80:22 that went nuts and screwed up his entire
80:24 life and that took the steam out of it
80:28 none of my guys would ever do what they
80:30 said they would do and so we lost a lot
80:32 on the mobile conversion I had startup
80:36 after startup where everything was in
80:37 place one guy starts the line is ass off
80:39 poof the company disappears and all the
80:43 funding lined up you know it's it's
80:45 usually one person in there this
80:47 advertises the whole thing and so it
80:50 would be easy especially even a movie
80:52 would be really kind of a neat movie to
80:54 say maybe this is what I did to other
80:56 people you know maybe I was the one that
80:58 kept ganking people's success they got
81:01 really close and then BOOM pull it back
81:02 now again between all those other
81:04 stories I've got success after success
81:06 and really cool things I got to do all
81:08 those things so I'm very happy with the
81:10 outcome but what would it have been
81:12 maybe I would have turned into a piece
81:13 of [ __ ] human being if I'd made it rich
81:15 by twenty years old what if I was a
81:17 millionaire by 20 maybe I'd be a
81:18 jerk-off maybe I would have atrophied
81:21 never created all the other things that
81:23 I created because the strife was there
81:25 to take away those successes and forced
81:28 me to do something different and so it's
81:32 a weird almost romantic sort of
81:35 scapegoat for reality if you endure any
81:38 hardship and the more you become a week
81:40 and let's study the dimensionality of
81:42 why things fail because every time I
81:44 ever experienced failure I would take a
81:46 deep breath step back and go what went
81:49 wrong because I never want this to
81:51 happen again and so I get a little bit
81:54 better at evaluating people and
81:56 evaluating the
81:57 acts and but still it would always sneak
82:01 in there and part of the reason why the
82:05 first season of this show is so valuable
82:07 to me is that I'm passing to you within
82:11 the first hundred episodes everything
82:14 that ever made me have a success and
82:16 everything that ever took away an
82:18 opportunity from me because I didn't see
82:21 it coming
82:22 well I didn't know how to form a
82:23 business properly do not have distribute
82:25 stock sorry I didn't understand how to
82:27 have a business partner right business
82:30 partners are very tricky things if you
82:32 cannot have one don't have one fight
82:34 never to have one because they usually
82:36 just lead to you working your butt off
82:40 them getting lazy and then things go
82:43 weird so the reason why I mentioned that
82:45 in this episode is that the check sum
82:48 the comparison that you can do with this
82:50 reality is the dream realm and you do
82:54 get if you're like me you get an
82:57 instance and an example in an education
83:00 of what it could be like if we all got
83:03 along and so you look at this row and
83:06 you're like man of course America I can
83:09 only speak about America there was
83:10 probably more decades where we got along
83:13 than the ones that were we didn't get
83:14 along and we just happen to be sitting
83:16 around top of the powder keg that George
83:18 Soros's destroyed the world Satan is
83:21 here thing
83:22 and so we're experience kind of a weird
83:25 bump right now which is weird which is
83:27 why every celebrity from Richter vase to
83:29 Dave Chappelle to Bill burr are all
83:31 fighting back to say enough is enough
83:33 guys we're not listening to your crap
83:36 anymore we don't even care anymore
83:37 I saw an article today online it was
83:40 through Facebook someone posted actually
83:42 one of my close buddies posted it and it
83:44 was a an article that was talking about
83:48 Blazing Saddles the movie and it said
83:50 Blazing Saddles the movie that could not
83:52 be made today now as an American Blazing
83:58 Saddles
83:58 by Mel Brooks is the one of the funniest
84:01 movies ever made on planet earth right
84:04 if you so show it justice warrior that
84:07 they're gonna say oh my God look how
84:09 race
84:10 that is and I say well why is it racist
84:13 well the white people are calling the
84:15 black guy the n-word the black guy is so
84:18 courteous and nice it's all the white
84:20 people and eventually of course the
84:22 black character wins over all the white
84:24 people in the movie but then you know
84:26 you let him get it all out of their
84:27 system while they hate this movie why
84:29 it's so inappropriate and then I say
84:30 okay well you know a black guy wrote all
84:32 the white people lines and a bunch of
84:35 white people wrote the black guys lines
84:36 and that's how they configured it to
84:38 make it as funny as possible and okay
84:41 with all the cultures that might
84:42 criticize it and was the reason why it
84:44 released and became one of the biggest
84:46 cult classic comedies of the twenty 20th
84:49 century no what would they do when their
84:52 heads just explode you know so I think
84:56 that dreams have a value to us that goes
85:00 way beyond have a little bit of fun what
85:03 do we say we talk about getting your
85:05 dreams
85:05 well we euphoric Lee dream up
85:08 eventualities ourselves and we try to go
85:10 get it
85:11 we set a deadline so it has a goal and
85:13 then becomes a goal then we go after so
85:20 as you think about your day and you try
85:23 to harmonize a law of attraction feeling
85:26 for yourself you know hopefully you
85:29 dream if you just dream a little tiny
85:32 bit then I want you to take that little
85:35 tiny bit that you dream and write it
85:37 down when you wake up write it down
85:39 don't put it in your [ __ ] phone
85:41 write it down the pen paper at old
85:43 analog technology and I'm willing to bet
85:47 that little seedling of a dream will get
85:49 bigger and bigger and bigger longer and
85:52 more detailed until you're basically
85:54 just stretching a hole in that dream
85:56 world where you can go and nurture who
86:00 you think you are and just remember when
86:03 you wake up it's all about symbology of
86:07 the dream what is the purpose of the
86:11 dream what did you get out of it you
86:15 know one thing I've told my closest
86:17 friends which I don't know if I think I
86:18 may be mentioned it once here but I'm
86:20 kind of off you skated it a little bit
86:22 so it would be so see
86:24 but I would say this in the in the
86:29 sexual realm of the human mind okay
86:32 everything that turns you on is a symbol
86:35 you either want to be the controller or
86:38 you want to be controlled you like
86:41 straight up normal meat potato things or
86:44 you're looking for something that to you
86:47 is taboo you know whatever it is
86:49 everything that turns you on the
86:51 constitutes your climax it's a certain
86:54 group of symbols that make you go when
86:56 you're 15 25 35 45 it changes over time
87:00 well take that take that little piece of
87:03 information and bring them back to your
87:05 entire life because the sexual content
87:08 the subject matter is very vivid in your
87:10 mind depending on what kind of person
87:11 you are
87:12 so bring that back to your normal life
87:14 cleanest Lea and just say everything
87:17 that turns me on in life this is simple
87:19 I like to help people I like to be
87:22 helped
87:24 it's all symbology do you like to tell
87:27 the truth and you're honorable it's an
87:29 honorable symbol I like to screw people
87:32 in business deals let's just say well
87:34 then you're that kind of guy or that
87:36 kind of girl
87:37 get it once you boil down the symbols
87:40 then you can kind of look for partners a
87:42 little bit better partners and life
87:44 partners in business you know I forgot
87:48 the name of that the movie that Nic Cage
87:52 is Sam Rockwell made where they're con
87:54 mitten if you look at that movie what
87:57 makes sense is that Sam Rockwell and Nic
88:01 Cage are the same person they're con
88:03 artists they play games with people and
88:06 steal their money there you go they
88:10 found each other they liver the same
88:11 symbology poof perfect perfect set of
88:15 fictional characters in a movie as a
88:17 writer you got to pay attention to those
88:19 things as well so anyway hope you feel
88:23 me on that one let me know what you
88:25 experienced let me know if you've ever
88:26 consciously felt yourself go to sleep
88:29 and into the dream world you know study
88:34 the dreams that you remember for
88:37 sort of what they mean to you and and
88:40 when you dream moving forward after this
88:42 episode really pay attention to what you
88:46 really see in what you don't see do you
88:47 have personal conversations with people
88:49 they're really detailed do you look at
88:51 their face and really pay attention and
88:53 what they look like or is this sort of
88:56 this nebulous I'm with these people and
88:57 I really notice the environment more
88:59 than the people you may have very
89:02 specific things like I again I I had a
89:04 dream with last six months that like
89:06 three women i sat on the sofa and these
89:09 three women kind of laid on me and on
89:11 themselves it was real late at night
89:13 they're always dressed but one woman had
89:15 a sort of a denim jean like a real dark
89:20 denim jean she was kind of a more full
89:23 body gal but she laid on top of me and
89:25 it just felt good and I was kind of
89:27 rubbing her leg and it was all smooth
89:28 because it was like very stretched dunno
89:30 okay but it was like wow this is these
89:33 are people really good people and we all
89:34 just loved each other and it wasn't even
89:36 a sexual thing it was just it was just
89:39 like he almost monkeys like yeah let's
89:41 just get together and keep warm and it
89:43 was beautiful weird so tell me what you
89:46 what you've been dreaming about lately
89:47 I'm gonna be really cool anything that
89:50 reoccurs tell me about that as you wake
89:54 up what makes you wake up do you have
89:55 smooth awakenings do you have violent
89:58 awakenings like I had a girlfriend once
90:00 that anytime I woke her up she would
90:02 flip out I mean she's shaken scream or
90:04 not screen isn't silly would she cook
90:05 you know like that every single time so
90:07 I never woke her up because it was like
90:09 terrifying you know it's like like I
90:11 feel like I was inserting in her world a
90:13 negative to wake her up
90:15 and I'm really a gentle person right so
90:18 it was really strange let me know how
90:20 you how you roll right now in 2020 if

90:45 the first 50 on there again every 50 is
90:48 better than the next 50 so the view

90:58 be anything so you can get over there

92:21 also recommend two products the brave
92:24 browser it's a non deep state browser
92:27 chromium is I think a Google invention
92:29 which I just looked that up I said this
92:31 incorrectly in a previous bumper I'll
92:34 try to cut it out if I can but it's
92:37 still they're not tracking anything it
92:39 changed your search engine from Google
92:41 to DuckDuckGo and then all of your
92:44 blockers are blocked out it just it
92:46 saves you so much time it's very very
92:48 quick the other product is back plays
92:50 which is just a great backup tool eight
92:52 bucks a month one computer infinite
92:55 storage
92:55 I make no money from those last two
92:57 things at all but I just put them under
92:58 donation because it's supposed to
93:00 whatever if I got a million viewers or
93:02 whatever then yeah
93:04 might make fifty bucks a month maybe
93:05 anyway the other one is a store there
93:08 are two shirts up there for season five
93:10 I will make more but I will shut off all
93:14 seasonal shirts as soon as the season's
93:16 over regardless if I continue making
93:17 episodes like I make episodes through
93:21 the summer while we're waiting for the
93:22 next season to come around it's gonna be
93:25 hard to beat that intro but I'm gonna do
93:28 it as I mentioned there's a store so get
93:32 up there and get that you will not find
93:35 any season 1 episodes on this channel
93:36 because they're all from their own
93:37 channel because I had to turn them all
93:39 off because music broke them all so if
93:42 you want to see the first hundred
93:43 episodes get up there and subscribe to
93:45 that just leave the background there's
93:46 no ads so you can just flow through them
93:48 if you're on a podcast know that your
93:50 podcast reader we usually limit the
93:51 amount of episodes that will read so if
93:54 you have that problem go to the website
93:57 search on the episode you want download
93:59 the mp3 and listen to it to your heart's
94:00 content or stop using iTunes use a
94:03 different product to listen to you the
94:06 podcast and you can usually get all it
94:10 should be near 500 episodes at this
94:11 point anyway take care of yourself in
94:15 someone else and I will see you in the
94:16 next deep thoughts over now
