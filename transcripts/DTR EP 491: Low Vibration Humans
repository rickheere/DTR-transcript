00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today I thought I would talk
00:33 about a subject that has been one of
00:36 those weird situations where you know
00:41 when you learn new word and then all the
00:44 sudden you hear it everywhere over the
00:47 last year I have I have one friend who
00:51 uses this term all the time and so I
00:56 she's the one that really brought it to
00:57 my attention but she was the only person
00:59 in my life for probably at least a year
01:02 who was routinely mentioning this
01:05 metaphor for sort of the quality of a
01:08 human being and part of it has to do
01:11 with their ability to process
01:14 information and thus be enlightened and
01:18 in a lot of cases being less gullible
01:24 thus more sort of indirectly through
01:29 common law good and has to do with
01:33 vibrational frequencies what my friend
01:37 says and this is being said by a lot of
01:40 people around me now lately and you know
01:42 maybe lots like three more people I
01:45 think I've even heard it in some YouTube
01:47 videos that have never said it before
01:49 that I have ever heard them say it but
01:52 the notion is this high vibration people
01:56 are typically more intelligent more
01:58 Lucent lucid and therefore if they don't
02:02 have a psychopathic mind or something
02:08 they which usually the higher frequency
02:11 will allow one to manifest a better
02:14 reality but we do know we have
02:16 Psychopaths the sociopaths that have
02:20 very clean minds in terms of the
02:25 frequency but for whatever reason they
02:27 choose demise because perhaps they were
02:30 again abused as young people
02:35 and then the other notion is that a low
02:37 vibration person is someone who is sort
02:41 of slow they're incapable of gathering
02:45 the amount of information that a high
02:48 frequency person gathers and so they
02:51 typically find themselves upside down
02:54 constantly they would be the individuals
02:57 that allow tyranny to take over the
03:00 world take over their country right so
03:02 someone says do this do that and they're
03:04 like okay sure yeah hey you gotta do
03:07 what they say
03:08 doesn't mean they're physically weak
03:10 they could be monsters physically but
03:13 they're just low vibration people now
03:16 before we continue too much further I
03:20 definitely want to make a distinction
03:21 here before we get into this this isn't
03:24 necessarily trying to say that high
03:28 vibration people are better than low
03:30 vibration people but what this means is
03:33 in a world of manipulators and
03:35 corruption and greed and people that are
03:38 trying to deceive other people the low
03:42 vibration people become prey and so
03:45 whereas we might identify someone that
03:48 we mutually agree is a low vibration
03:50 person but they're good-hearted person
03:52 they live a simple life they live it in
03:55 perpetual congruence with nature right
03:58 where they don't try to ask more of the
04:00 world in the world can provide they
04:01 don't work you know ridiculous hours and
04:05 try to just be this excuse that we call
04:08 sophisticated right which in large part
04:11 is usually alive the humans tell
04:14 themselves to get themselves completely
04:16 overwhelmed but to also charge
04:17 themselves to do things that they never
04:20 thought they could do before so there's
04:22 always that kind of well well you know
04:24 well you know what you can accomplish
04:27 now we are always talking about sort of
04:32 remaining as healthy as possible don't
04:35 pollute your body with bunch of toxins
04:37 they don't need a bunch of process
04:39 ionized food trying to get eat your
04:41 stuff as fresh as possible etc etc eat
04:44 what you're made out of
04:46 I understand what you're made out of
04:48 understand how your body really works
04:49 and not the propaganda of which they
04:51 tell you your body works bruce lipton is
04:53 a great source most of you are aware of
05:00 the pineal gland it's not the penny
05:03 alone it's the pineal gland most of you
05:07 understand that if a pioneer gland is
05:08 working properly then your ability to
05:14 gather tremendous amounts of information
05:16 is much much easier
05:19 therefore discerning your reality and
05:22 forming an image of yourself it's
05:25 extremely important little practice if
05:28 you are incapable of forming from your
05:32 soul which is your true self right
05:34 you're borrowing this vessel which is
05:36 gonna disappear at one point we can't
05:38 get all crazy about it right this is
05:41 just a more lucid dream what's going on
05:43 right but if you can't create a very
05:48 vivid image of your instance of being
05:51 then you will most likely not need in
05:55 your mind facilities for this vessel to
06:00 go and do things in your life and what
06:02 do I mean by that freedom when the
06:06 pineal gland is destroyed not completely
06:09 but very injured through fluoride
06:12 mercury aluminum other isotopes and
06:16 horrible things nutrients missing can
06:18 also make you very docile right stop
06:20 eating what you're made out of and I'm
06:23 not a plant just so you know
06:25 the thing doesn't get nourished gets
06:28 rotted out
06:29 you know fluoride is an aluminum dust
06:31 and so it goes into your areas of your
06:34 body and your bones and your teeth and
06:35 it starts moving it all out of it out of
06:38 the way thus your teeth fall out your
06:40 bones get osteoporosis and you get this
06:42 crystal form of formation inside your
06:46 Ponyo clay that impairs your ability to
06:49 punch your soul into this universe and
06:54 ask the body vessel what's going on what
06:59 are we seeing what are we feeling
07:00 what are we physically feeling what are
07:01 we emotionally feeling can you hear that
07:03 can you see that all the senses that you
07:06 have are routed through your pineal
07:08 gland at a cognitive recognition level
07:13 now the other parts you know you know
07:15 there's parts they have that map of how
07:17 your body is distributed over your brain
07:20 that is simply the input mechanism like
07:25 when you plug in a wire into the
07:26 backyard computer to get your computer
07:28 printer working or your mouse working or
07:30 hard drive working you know that the
07:32 port itself isn't the CPU the central
07:36 processing unit it's not the brain of
07:38 the computer it's just a port so those
07:40 maps of how your brain is distributed
07:42 you know the big sections that are your
07:44 hand and that kind of stuff those are
07:46 just ports those aren't your central
07:48 processing units in terms of your
07:50 self-identity remember that now if you
07:56 want to understand a deeper easier
07:59 understanding of high-frequency humans
08:01 versus low-frequency humans you need not
08:05 look further than a computer
08:07 when you go by a computer what are some
08:10 of the statistics that you make sure
08:13 your computer has well first it would be
08:17 you know actually I'm gonna skiffle
08:19 would normally be first but at a minimum
08:21 how much harddrive space does it have
08:23 long-term storage that your memory
08:25 that's stored in the universe how much
08:27 short-term memory do you have meaning
08:29 your RAM that your consciousness now you
08:33 know it's gonna come with a keyboard and
08:35 a mouse and a case and you're going to
08:38 pick out a monitor
08:39 your eyeballs but you at some point will
08:44 start asking question without you know
08:46 how this works or not well how fast this
08:49 is CPU and what's the answer they give
08:54 you an answer in frequency it's a 4
08:58 gigahertz
08:59 it's a dual-core it's a quad-core it's
09:01 got 16 cores etc etc frequencies sine
09:07 cosine waves of essentially electricity
09:11 that can pulse through that CPU thus
09:14 allowing it at every peak in valley to
09:17 complete a logic gate situation with
09:22 dual course they can wrap make and map
09:25 excuse me multiple frequencies of
09:28 electricity and have multiple brains
09:30 going at the same time the key is the
09:34 higher the frequency the faster the
09:37 computer what makes how do you define a
09:40 computer's being fast well I can get the
09:43 computer to do a lot of things much
09:45 quicker than it used to even if it was
09:47 single thread one brain hey 10 gigahertz
09:51 CPU single thread good sometimes beat
09:54 dual core three gigahertz cuz it's just
09:57 so much faster but now every single
10:00 computer is multiple cores and human
10:03 beings really only have one core to be
10:06 honest at least with that we've been
10:09 able to test and I can definitely say I
10:11 had a partner that od'd on this and my
10:13 game company and I have to say he's
10:16 right I mean you can do things you can
10:19 knock things into your autonomic system
10:21 like again like I said in the episode
10:23 you know playing the drums and then you
10:25 can talk to someone at the same time so
10:27 some of that stuff goes into a different
10:28 area of your mind
10:29 but in terms of true having a
10:32 conversation with two people at once
10:34 it's that starts to become immediately
10:35 difficult the reason why you know prior
10:40 to cell phones we were able to put
10:41 makeup on in the car eat a hamburger in
10:44 the car have a conversation with the
10:45 passenger and not wreck the car and then
10:48 all the sudden when you look at a key
10:49 screen and start trying to drive well
10:52 the screen is putting you into a alpha
10:55 state of suggestibility so it's already
10:57 putting you into trance to when you need
11:00 to read you are engaging pattern
11:04 recognition phonics and then you know
11:09 reading comprehension that then is
11:11 turning into a picture inside your mind
11:13 the amount of processor power takes to
11:16 read is really intense because it's kind
11:19 of an unnatural thing that man has
11:21 developed we're at a point now in 2020
11:28 where they are trying to utterly toy
11:30 with and they do successfully toy with
11:33 our frequencies through toxic
11:36 toxification of the human body never
11:40 forget the World Trade Organization
11:41 brought us Codex Alimentarius I have an
11:44 episode on it there's a theme going on
11:46 here that deemed vitamins and minerals
11:51 toxins and then cleared the way for a
11:56 hundred and seventy six pesticides and
11:58 toxins to be legally put into your food
12:01 at toxic levels meaning lethal levels
12:04 meaning and technically it's a
12:06 carcinogenic you know it will get to the
12:08 point where it destroys your DNA
12:10 chemically and therefore your immune
12:13 system is overburdened and depending on
12:15 your genetics and your health regiment
12:18 your sleep all that stuff you could
12:21 catch a disease a cancer or something
12:25 else so it's very important that you
12:28 watched my episode on toxins watch
12:30 anything in health and the playlist on
12:32 deep thoughts radio com or on youtube so
12:36 there's a few goals here but this
12:37 episode
12:39 the first and first goal is for you to
12:42 understand the concept as deeply as
12:44 possible you have a frequency like a
12:48 computer
12:49 the faster the computer is the more
12:51 instructions that it can process per
12:54 second now if for whatever reason we
12:57 could figure out that we have certain
12:59 kind of sub processors like you know a
13:01 computer's will have like a sound
13:02 processor you know video card processor
13:07 than the main CPU
13:10 we definitely have those different types
13:12 of processors inside our mind but the
13:16 faster you can think the faster you can
13:19 process information
13:20 the faster you can process information
13:22 when you walk around ok you will see
13:26 more flowers to stop and smell you will
13:29 take in more dimensions of existence
13:33 thus be more lucid human being the
13:37 slower your brain works you don't see
13:42 much you wake up in a feral State a
13:45 person like this does wakes up in a
13:47 feral state of just eat sleep eat sleep
13:52 right up from there it's eat work eat
13:57 sleep and you just keep stair-stepping
14:00 it up we all know people like this
14:05 what's interesting is is that there
14:10 probably are situations where genetics
14:12 have gone wrong and there is a
14:15 propensity to be slow minded simply
14:19 because of inbreeding not necessarily
14:21 brother and sister but just gene pool
14:24 didn't didn't go much further which is
14:30 why some you know mixing of our genes is
14:32 just phenomenal we get these amazing
14:34 combinations right but the other huge
14:37 one is your your sociological experiment
14:42 within the household if you have low
14:46 frequency human beings having children
14:48 how are they to get anything other than
14:51 a low frequency regiment slash demand on
14:55 their life thus but like I've always
14:59 told you guys your brain makes new
15:02 neurons based on how much you use your
15:04 brain it's a frequency issue once a
15:07 neuron is overused that kicks off a
15:10 reproductive process for the neuron it
15:13 spits out part of its nucleus into the
15:16 brain chamber and all the other neurons
15:19 work together to build a protective coat
15:21 backs over that Nicholas material inside
15:26 the coax is a communication to all the
15:29 other neurons and so the more you think
15:31 the more you challenge yourself and
15:33 solve problems right some people confuse
15:35 this some people will think well I read
15:38 a bunch of books that keeps me young
15:40 keeps my brain sharp not really solving
15:44 problems keeps your brain sharp
15:47 challenging yourself was something that
15:50 is not instantly understood it's healthy
15:53 for you that's why most of your truthers
15:57 have exceptionally high IQs in various
16:01 regions that they are most turned on by
16:05 I mean what's funny about it is then
16:07 again we haven't talked about this in
16:10 quite a while but for those that have
16:12 recently in the last five years been
16:15 introduced to like this new resurgence
16:18 of the Flat Earth theory now if you're a
16:21 person who was raised that it's a globe
16:23 technically speaking you could be a very
16:25 low-frequency globe person because all
16:28 you've ever done is taken the word for
16:30 it you've never seen any proof that the
16:32 world's round I mean you've never been
16:34 into space personally NASA's definitely
16:36 not the authority on real photographs of
16:39 space they're just not they've lied too
16:41 much
16:41 they could be showing us plenty of real
16:43 stuff you got a space station with no
16:47 window that faces space you know all
16:50 this fake footage and stuff so you could
16:52 have a person who's a flat earther who
16:54 you think is a complete [ __ ] but the
16:57 truth is they know more about how the
17:01 work earth works what experiments are
17:04 involved with proving it's round or flat
17:07 than you do and so we have to be careful
17:11 making assumptions about how smart we
17:13 are right now once you leave the
17:16 paradigm of the family which all of you
17:18 have met kids and they have unfortunate
17:21 parents and the kids are just carbon
17:23 copies man and you just pray to God they
17:26 can get out of that house and move far
17:27 far away to perhaps
17:29 advance themselves beyond the
17:32 limitations that have been sort of
17:33 taught to them
17:35 the next one is societal cultural
17:40 requirements of a human being
17:43 now again I'm the first person at this
17:47 point of my life to say that I know of a
17:50 lot of areas of the world that are
17:54 perceived as technically primitive
17:59 backwards someone might say low
18:02 frequency but I wouldn't make any
18:04 assumptions but people who live in
18:06 jungles the people who live in deserts
18:10 they still put face paint on they still
18:13 carry spears they still hunt animals
18:15 every single day there's way too many
18:17 assumptions about those individuals
18:21 being ignorant to the core sure you show
18:25 them an iPhone and say how do you think
18:27 this works they're not gonna have a clue
18:28 but then look at you and go I I gotta go
18:33 hunt and what I've been taught hunting
18:36 is physically belong beyond anything
18:39 you've ever done in your life even if
18:41 you're a Navy SEAL or a Delta Force guy
18:43 they're gonna be like well your guns
18:46 really nice I really like your gun now I
18:49 got to go kill you know an elk I gotta
18:52 kill a lion I gotta kill something we
18:54 can eat and then this dude's a well geez
18:57 how the hell is that work I mean you
18:59 know without a gun so I'm not talking
19:03 about those areas of the world but there
19:06 are areas where integrity is low as a
19:11 cultural thing sometimes they're unaware
19:14 that that's the case they belong to a
19:18 form of government that crafts their
19:20 mind some of them get lucid within those
19:24 realms through sneaking information in
19:26 but isn't it funny that if you find in
19:29 say a communist country a person who is
19:33 really lucid very you know westernized
19:36 in a good way not the bad way they
19:40 typically have a history of sneaking on
19:42 the VPNs and getting over to Western
19:45 society through the internet and seeing
19:47 something that they're not supposed to
19:49 see that increases their frequency
19:52 because they're seeing a wealth of
19:54 information that needs to be processed
19:56 and just like lelou and Fifth Element
19:59 who started watching TV she wanted to
20:03 know everything she could about humanity
20:05 before saving it and what does she do
20:08 the story was that her DNA was I think
20:11 five times as dense as our DNA and so
20:13 her whole frequency was at least five
20:16 times faster than ours so she could
20:18 watch the news extremely fast
20:20 remember the Johnny Five robot from a
20:21 short circuit which Sid me design he was
20:24 able to ingest the same way
20:26 he's a robot he's a computer he has a
20:28 faster frequency than us Marie had read
20:30 the books really fast at his finger
20:32 okay so what I find interesting is we're
20:38 in a world now where prior to all this
20:42 absolute chaos we know that you know
20:48 especially with the internet because it
20:50 shrinks the size of the world and all of
20:52 its obstacles such that we just feel
20:58 closer don't we I mean you know you
21:00 could if you were like I want to go to
21:02 Germany and and see the new Siobhan
21:05 Stein castle whatever you could watch
21:08 200 hours of people's travel videos
21:11 there and then you were gonna figure out
21:12 whether or not that's something you
21:13 still want to see and if you do go there
21:15 you're like oh man I really want to see
21:16 that with my own two eyes and so you can
21:18 get really well informed very quickly as
21:22 an American on this end I am confused
21:29 and I think I think I have any a reason
21:32 why this may not be confusing but let me
21:36 just ask you folks that are in Europe at
21:40 least those in the EU the experiment of
21:44 freedom originated probably in Egypt
21:48 first but it wasn't until Magna Carta
21:50 right 1000 AD that the robber barons of
21:53 the time said look you know we're not
21:55 going to let you rule over us monarchy
21:59 it was a King John or something like
22:00 that but they wrote this thing that
22:03 became the Constitution for us but then
22:06 they soon lost control of that over
22:08 there within a hundred years they'd
22:09 almost abolish the whole thing through
22:11 manipulation like the king was
22:12 manipulating the people again the robber
22:14 barons died so that the defenders of
22:16 that document and its purpose died and
22:19 so when belly up you know massive
22:22 Inquisition to reforge Rome from being
22:27 legions to being Jesus Christ entity 900
22:30 years and then in three different phases
22:34 and then we sort of end up in the modern
22:37 moral mother late 1500s the monarchies
22:42 had gotten so out of control in Europe
22:44 with stamp taxes and all that kind of
22:47 stuff sort of the stuff we're seeing
22:48 today that you know a couple hundred
22:53 years later we you know we had folks
22:55 that came over here and started founding
22:57 a new country by the mid 1700s
23:00 we had a gaggle of guys that were the
23:03 forefathers of America and they created
23:05 this place albeit Masonic as hell and
23:10 managed to get the the experiment of
23:13 freedom freedom of speech gun rights
23:17 know he's dropping right to you know a
23:19 speedy trial no double jeopardy all
23:22 these things in place and it was working
23:27 now it wasn't more than let's see if you
23:33 think 1812 is the end of the revolution
23:35 by the 1830s you have the infiltrators
23:38 already over here I mean they wasted no
23:40 time got Skull and Bones and 1830s we
23:43 got the Democrats and 1830s again the
23:46 ones that didn't want to get rid of
23:47 slaves but still the idea of freedom was
23:51 right there in your face we had
23:53 sovereign money we have freedom real
23:58 honest-to-goodness freedom no income tax
24:00 until 1913 no it's pretty amazing we did
24:03 eventually free the slaves but then the
24:05 Democrat Jim Crow came around and wrote
24:08 a bunch of black code laws to get them
24:10 trapped back into servitude a lot of
24:13 white people stuck in that to just you
24:14 know but we're in the 21st century and I
24:19 am seeing tyrannical stuff everywhere
24:23 and a high-frequency mind would not
24:27 allow that to occur and there's plenty
24:31 of you I think every single person on
24:32 this show is high frequency which is why
24:34 when you guys report in your reporting
24:36 in almost like field reporters that are
24:38 like yeah we don't like this and there's
24:40 plenty of people like me over here
24:42 now I think the so might my confusion
24:46 just to sum up the the point I'm trying
24:47 to make is I don't understand how this
24:51 globalist New World Order thing because
24:54 if the World Trade Organization hadn't
24:56 deemed vitamins and minerals a toxins
24:59 and 176 pesticides is okay at lethal
25:01 levels I would think that globalism was
25:04 working really well if the World Health
25:07 Organization wouldn't drum up a common
25:10 cold as the pandemic when a pandemics
25:12 definition as a million people have to
25:14 pass away before historians will call
25:16 this a pandemic think about it in 20
25:20 years how do they report on our
25:21 timeframe they can't technically say it
25:25 was a pandemic all they can do is say
25:27 the news call data pandemic the World
25:29 Health Organization called a pandemic
25:31 but it wasn't one unless we have some
25:34 something new happen right so we
25:39 obviously think that voter fraud is a
25:42 big mechanism of how all of this has
25:45 come to pass the presidents of the
25:49 United States up until
25:52 20:16 all had their own ballots after at
25:58 least after Kennedy but even Kennedy has
26:00 the story where his father used various
26:02 shadow factions to get his son into
26:04 office okay but we've had a lot of
26:09 manipulation of the world but which
26:12 person is going to see a conspiracy
26:14 against them
26:16 a low frequency person which has limited
26:19 amount of cycles per second to gather
26:22 information to thus create a picture of
26:25 what they're experiencing or someone
26:29 with a very quick processor that sees it
26:32 so fast that in a millisecond in a
26:35 nanosecond they could write a joke about
26:37 it they can strategize their reply when
26:41 you see comedians really really good
26:44 comedians that get harassed from the
26:46 audience and within microseconds they've
26:50 got a very circumstantial quip that
26:55 either defuses the situation or boils
26:59 that person alive in the audience you
27:01 were looking at super high frequency
27:04 people then is what I believe most
27:06 comedians to to be and I think that for
27:09 them life is a joke because for them
27:13 they're just looking around going damn
27:14 you know like George Karl I mean give me
27:16 a break the dude was so utterly awake at
27:20 the end of his life it'll take a while
27:23 to get another one of those dudes right
27:24 I think a lot of writers for television
27:28 in Hollywood super high frequency and
27:32 the other aid with keeping yourself
27:38 detoxified is that RAM and generally a
27:45 great running operating system what does
27:49 that mean
27:51 I was talking to a friend of mine
27:52 tonight for probably an hour and it was
27:54 all about talking to people online now
27:58 that are struggling to wake up you kind
28:01 of feel they're the little motor
28:03 sputtering they're trying like one post
28:06 it seems like they're awake nine post
28:08 seems like they're asleep
28:09 so you feel it you feel them trying to
28:11 wake up so you're trying to like give
28:13 them little droplets of glucose you know
28:15 so they can gain consciousness or
28:17 something but they'll fight the
28:20 kubler-ross is in full effect
28:22 you can tell they don't research
28:23 anything but they know everything it's
28:25 just a defense mechanism right but you
28:31 know I use an example with my friend I
28:33 said it's amazing how people don't
28:37 understand how money is created at this
28:39 world and how it's valued against a
28:41 barrel of oil how investment house is
28:43 like you know goldman sachs are given
28:45 the money the second is created to then
28:47 distribute it to all of the globalist
28:49 partners that help move all these
28:51 agendas forward you know there's more
28:53 than one reason why you can't create a
28:55 Facebook competition our competitive
28:58 website like gap calm Minds calm and a
29:00 few others they've got the technology
29:02 all in place and it's not just an ad
29:04 based thing if they were to succeed they
29:08 have to borrow money to scale their
29:11 computers to a billion dollar
29:12 infrastructure like Facebook or not
29:14 multibillion-dollar we're gonna get that
29:17 money you're gonna walk straight into
29:20 the Lions Den and they're gonna turn you
29:22 down or they're gonna fold you up with
29:24 somebody else but when I see because I
29:29 have friends in Europe that are I think
29:31 100 percent of sleep you are my friends
29:36 that are awake what's interesting about
29:40 America is that we stand on the graves
29:45 of Native Americans and so no matter how
29:49 much we say you know this is America
29:51 it's ours it's like Adam a said and like
29:56 was the kings of the wild frontier
29:59 what is the the line was something like
30:01 feel beneath the white there is a
30:02 [ __ ] suffering but still Americans
30:06 managed to find a very patriotic
30:13 ownership of the land is it as if okay
30:16 so we have it now let's treat it right
30:20 but what's interesting about America
30:22 having been here roughly for about four
30:24 hundred years is that we you know you
30:27 come over here and you won't find too
30:30 many cowtowns you know there there is
30:34 architecture in New England that is back
30:36 here as far as the 1600s and gravestones
30:39 and that kind of stuff but other than
30:41 just New England which is a teeny tiny
30:43 place over there the rest of America is
30:46 pretty brand new I mean some of my
30:47 friends come over from Europe and I like
30:49 man it's just so weird every time I come
30:51 over it's like I said whiney as well
30:53 because it's it's always brand new like
30:55 your malls get destroyed and rebuilt and
30:59 then like New York City or some
31:02 classical location nothing's more about
31:05 150 years old and they're right in
31:09 Europe it's crazy old in places right
31:13 still some obviously major modern stuff
31:17 but there's castles man that go back but
31:21 a thousand years there I mean again I
31:25 when I was in the UK I remember asking
31:29 someone the strip of apartments which
31:32 had just been repainted and I said well
31:35 how old were those apartments and
31:37 someone said I don't know like 400 years
31:39 old just was like nothing so here's what
31:44 I don't get how is it this is just a
31:50 demonstration of my confusion of how
31:52 this works
31:54 how is it that as the European one could
31:58 give up Italy Germany France Spain
32:03 England Norway all these places to
32:07 random foreigners now visiting is fine
32:11 and immigrating over is fine as long as
32:13 you adapt to the current culture but the
32:15 idea that we're going to lose all that
32:18 history because believe me your old
32:21 buildings are coming down you know if
32:23 you mean come on you bring a bunch of
32:26 people over and they don't value your
32:28 form of religion well your churches are
32:30 gone
32:30 in fact they're blasphemous those
32:33 buildings well that's not how we like to
32:35 think about things we don't like that
32:36 color we don't like that architecture
32:38 that architecture reminds us of people
32:40 that are press this it's all coming down
32:41 and you lose the whole thing there's
32:45 something cultural going on in Europe
32:48 which I don't get and it's just sheer
32:51 ignorance of myself I could definitely
32:54 hear because I've been privy to business
32:58 partners in mind they've traveled over
33:02 in last 10 years during the Muslim
33:05 invasion over there yeah they said they
33:08 would be a party's and you know they
33:10 would hear a bunch of disparaging
33:11 remarks about our president and then
33:14 when my friend there's a couple
33:17 different guys you go over and they tell
33:19 me he's really hilarious stories because
33:20 they're at these kind of posh business
33:22 parties you know my friends look nothing
33:25 like me which is the funny part but in
33:28 one session
33:29 they were like listening to this bashing
33:33 of America in many different metrics and
33:37 then it was like well my friend asked
33:39 well what are you guys doing over here
33:41 by letting all these folks in burdening
33:44 your systems your welfare systems I mean
33:46 if there's ever a pandemic you guys are
33:48 going to need that money for your own
33:49 citizens and you're giving it all the
33:51 way to people that have no respect for
33:53 your way of life they're never going to
33:56 learn your native language they've told
33:57 you to your face they're bringing their
33:59 Sharia law over there seem strange
34:03 it's things like the 17 movement which
34:06 seems to have herded together for for
34:09 bad or worse for good or been
34:14 high-frequency autists that can conceive
34:20 of the big game because this was the
34:24 point I made to my friend you have to be
34:26 an artist to be able to understand how
34:29 the world works and for whatever reason
34:32 there are few individuals they can't now
34:37 again 17 movement brought together a
34:40 bunch of these folks from all different
34:42 walks of life all different cultures and
34:46 this is why I think we're seeing
34:48 protests way before all this lock-in
34:50 crap right it's very very encouraging
34:54 that someone's standing up now those
34:56 organizations can always be infiltrated
34:59 and changed we saw with the tea party
35:01 over here what is interesting about like
35:04 say the Paris situation and I think I
35:08 understand the broad stroke reasons why
35:11 they're protesting but I think there's
35:12 probably dozens and dozens of reasons
35:16 why they're doing it that I wouldn't
35:17 understand less I lived over there of
35:19 course but the first one is that they've
35:21 been put on to the social socialism dole
35:26 right living off these you know stipends
35:31 from the government they don't pay the
35:33 bills enough they're all living in these
35:35 little tiny apartments again I've
35:37 watched him a series of videos where it
35:40 was my apartment in Paris and I have a
35:43 cousin that lived over there in a
35:45 normal-sized apartment well you know
35:48 some of these rooms are so utterly teeny
35:51 that you would think that it's like a
35:54 bizarre hostel almost like someone
35:56 renting a large closet and these are
36:00 people's professional lives they've cut
36:03 weird you know they're very well built
36:06 little tiny showers and little tiny beds
36:09 and there is no other place there's a
36:11 little place to stand and then there's
36:13 the door to leave
36:15 as if this is a standard of living we
36:17 all want to have I told you guys that
36:21 when i detoxed
36:23 probably starting around 2010 it was
36:28 different things at different times
36:29 right you know my big detox was no
36:32 aluminum deodorant anymore
36:35 I don't wear antiperspirants excuse me I
36:37 wear deodorants made of a gel
36:40 no more aspartame intentionally anyway
36:43 no more fluoridated toothpaste try to
36:46 avoid Florida wherever I go
36:47 no more microwaves even though the way I
36:50 used it it was probably the lowest risk
36:53 method by just got rid of it and then
36:55 just eating less GMO more natural foods
37:00 and just trying to balance it because I
37:02 do have to eat out every once in a while
37:04 I'm gonna don't but getting pretty good
37:05 at eating in by the way and what I
37:09 experienced was a frequency upgrade that
37:12 was difficult to deal with those
37:14 hardcore listeners out there you've
37:16 heard this before but now we're right on
37:17 the subject here I was probably about a
37:21 year into it I never wrote down when I
37:25 did these things and so this was
37:27 something I regretted later cuz I would
37:29 have loved to have known so I could tell
37:31 you guys a certain you know expect this
37:35 maybe in the year or a year and a half
37:37 or whatever but I was in my car and I
37:41 was wandering through the neighborhood
37:43 roads to get to one of the main made
37:45 roads and I remember it's a sunny day in
37:49 the summertime nice and warm I got to
37:52 the intersection and I'm looking both
37:54 ways and all of a sudden when I panned
37:56 my brain back and forth paying my mind
37:59 and my eye sockets I felt like I was
38:03 digesting exponentially more data per
38:07 second like I had gone to sleep and
38:09 whatever little button need to needed to
38:11 click over in my brain it clicked over
38:13 hardcore and from that point forward for
38:18 probably it's hard to say didn't write
38:22 it down
38:22 was kind of dealing with it organically
38:25 and and it was kind of disturbing at
38:27 first because
38:29 man I was just crunching data it took
38:33 probably literally two months at least
38:36 to start getting not only comfortable
38:39 with it but excited about it and here's
38:44 the work thing I was obviously really
38:48 accomplished before any of this happened
38:50 I mean some of the greatest things in my
38:53 life had already happened so it wasn't
38:55 like without this stuff being pushed out
38:57 of my body I wasn't accomplishing great
38:59 things and so it's not like one equals
39:02 the other or one negates the other but
39:06 all of a sudden you know trying to
39:10 recall information was fluid
39:15 instantaneous and then the memory banks
39:19 that I used to hold you know an image of
39:24 something in my mind it seemed like I
39:29 had infinite RAM I could pull in in my
39:32 mind an infinite amount of data and then
39:35 just use it to have a conversation it
39:37 was almost like when you got you know
39:39 when you were a kid if you had like
39:41 Legos or a bunch of toys that belong
39:43 together you get them all out and you
39:47 put them all over the floor and you
39:49 start playing with them and you got all
39:50 your toy soldiers or dollies or whatever
39:52 they are and you could have a
39:54 full-fledged experience as opposed to
39:56 having just one of the toys out I hope
40:01 that you experience the same thing or
40:03 have already experienced that but it
40:08 started - once I started gaining control
40:11 I started coming back to sort of looking
40:15 at my life before and throughout my life
40:18 what I recognized was that throughout my
40:20 life I definitely ran into people of all
40:24 shapes and sizes that just were ahead of
40:30 me in the game in terms of being able to
40:33 look at reality and it really just split
40:36 split second you know vision and then
40:41 say something really intelligent about
40:43 what's going on and then I would go ooh
40:46 thank you you know like they built
40:49 something together so that I could take
40:51 it and use it myself and it was you know
40:56 there's only a few people I think I can
40:59 remember about three of these in my life
41:02 that were just so far advanced and being
41:06 able just to recognize what was going on
41:09 that I I sort of made it as a goal of
41:12 mine I want to get to be at their level
41:15 I want to increase my thinking and my
41:17 recce
41:18 ition at their level but I had no
41:22 metaphor for how to describe it I had no
41:24 scientific means to do it I didn't know
41:27 what it would take to do it and it
41:30 wasn't until I detox that it seemed to
41:32 happen automatically I experimented at
41:36 one point in my mind and this is totally
41:37 incorrect what I'm about to say but
41:39 there was a point where I thought you
41:44 know I couldn't see them myself because
41:45 I was an only child so I didn't have any
41:47 brothers or sisters to connect it to so
41:49 I started looking at brothers and
41:51 sisters and it's a fascinating thing
41:53 when a family you have four or five
41:55 families that had three kids and you
41:57 have that those age-old questions that
41:59 they always ask well which one are you
42:01 on the first child Allah so you had the
42:03 hard road yeah yeah I was last time oh
42:05 you got it easy right oh yeah my parents
42:07 were totally you know busted apart by my
42:10 first brother or sister whatever and
42:14 then there's the middle kid or middle
42:16 children like there could be eight or
42:17 whatever and they're typically like
42:20 vying for attention because they're the
42:23 second kid first kids usually the star
42:26 so I can get me I noticed it's totally
42:28 different which is why it's not true so
42:31 I thought for a short period of time
42:33 that I was seeing a pattern in siblings
42:36 that I could use to explain things and
42:40 then you find totally different mixes
42:44 and you realize there's there's
42:46 definitely those stereotypical
42:49 behavioral patterns and people there
42:52 will be the kid that's super lazy
42:53 because the parents are worn down
42:55 there's the kids striving for a tension
42:57 it comes becomes a celebrity a lot of
43:00 times the first kid if they behave
43:01 become the scientist the doctor or
43:03 whatever because they're out to please
43:05 mom and dad just in their world it is
43:08 just them and mom and dad and these
43:09 other two characters were just a pain in
43:11 the ass you know when I have seen
43:16 friends move from little tiny towns to
43:20 big cities there is always an adaptation
43:24 phase now psychologically they're
43:27 typically going through numerous levels
43:30 of culture shock
43:31 there's way too much traffic there's way
43:33 too many people for them initially but
43:37 there's something that some friends of
43:38 mine and I from the Midwest that are out
43:40 here now we call it the tempo and what
43:44 is tempo it's a frequency and I had a
43:48 you know extremely close friend of mine
43:50 go through this and I was in her life
43:52 when this was happening and so we can
43:56 talk about it all the time and so what
43:58 we do is when we see other people move
44:01 drastically from an urban well maybe
44:04 more Midwest area to a metropolitan area
44:08 we talk about it well house their tempo
44:11 doing mmm it's still kind of slow okay
44:14 yeah but you do speed up as a result of
44:17 acclamation with your area the reason
44:22 why I mention this is that I am
44:23 interested at this point and figuring
44:26 out if there's a way to just de-facto
44:30 speed things up now there's obviously at
44:35 the same time a limit that we should
44:38 establish for ourselves in terms of the
44:42 speed because we don't want to become
44:43 crazy and psychotic because yeah I don't
44:46 know we're seeing things that no one
44:47 else is seeing and perhaps we're
44:49 injecting things that aren't there like
44:52 sort of that movie with the movie with
44:56 Jim Carrey where you kept seeing a
44:58 number you know you don't want to become
45:00 one of those kind of folks again
45:03 probably one of the analogies I
45:07 personally think of in my mind is the
45:08 snake eating its tail and when someone
45:11 told me that you know does that genius
45:14 and insanity are neck and neck I've said
45:18 this before when the head is eating the
45:22 tail I always think of the head as the
45:24 genius and the tail is insanity and and
45:27 when you go around the clock of the
45:29 snake's body which is a loop
45:32 you have sort of a medium level person
45:35 down at six o'clock and then maybe if
45:38 the head is eating from at counter
45:40 clockwise then you know about one
45:45 o'clock you're in a really comfortable
45:47 Genius stage of your DNA of your
45:49 experience
45:50 you're the best you've ever been now as
45:53 each decade goes by in your life in my
45:55 opinion your snake upgrades so your full
45:58 potential of what you could be also
46:00 upgrades you know what you're capable of
46:02 doing 10 through 19 is one set of things
46:06 20 to 29 you know etc if you've ever
46:10 been really aggressive about waking up
46:12 and you went down some rabbit hole or
46:16 several you know you know that you
46:20 probably on your scale that I just gave
46:24 you felt like you might have been
46:27 getting so close to the tip of that
46:29 analogy that you're getting close to
46:31 insanity because you're like nobody
46:34 thinks I'm telling them the truth you
46:37 know and I'm looking at this stuff and
46:39 the more I bump into people like me all
46:41 of a sudden you feel like here's six
46:43 o'clock you know what if you were trying
46:47 to wake up in the 90s and you spend
46:50 entire 90s trying to get awakened you're
46:52 successfully retrieving a bunch of
46:54 information but in 2000 you meet Bill
46:56 Cooper now sudden you sit down with him
46:59 and you go from figuring that you're
47:03 insane you're talking to someone who not
47:06 only knows what you know but knows a lot
47:07 more and that dials you back on your
47:10 little scale the frequency thing for me
47:14 is huge because it does call out our
47:19 potential nugget some folks are not a
47:24 part of the problem because they're not
47:26 greedy they haven't been raised with
47:28 that and so that we don't need to worry
47:31 about them
47:34 but what was the deal with well I'm
47:38 gonna give you a biblical reference but
47:42 it's sort of like the serpent talking to
47:44 Eve and luring her to eating the Apple
47:48 of course but that's a little esoteric
47:50 for this conversation you know that you
47:54 have seen in your lifetime either
47:56 personally you've seen it or you've seen
47:58 it through circumstantial evidence in
48:02 history where there might be two tribes
48:07 let's just say keep it pretty simple
48:09 like Ace Ventura - right two tribes
48:12 they're peaceful until someone else
48:18 shows up a third party shows up and you
48:20 know they like they're like okay there's
48:23 minerals under the land over there these
48:25 two tribes are pretty much dead even
48:27 because they've been fighting for 10,000
48:30 years so once someone innovates a spear
48:32 or a rock or something else the bow and
48:34 arrow both of them get it eventually
48:36 pretty quickly they're kind of dead even
48:39 but they're like we the third party
48:42 can't be caught killing that other group
48:45 of folks because we have guns missiles
48:47 and tanks that's not going to seem fair
48:50 it's going to be a genocide and
48:51 everyone's going to in trouble but the
48:53 corporation wants to grab the uranium
48:54 under their feet so they go to the other
48:58 tribe and just gift them things and give
49:04 them this vision of grandeur to say well
49:08 you know what if you take that land over
49:10 there
49:11 we will provide so much stuff that you
49:14 want radios and other trinkets sneakers
49:17 and bubblicious gum or whatever and you
49:20 will be one of the most sophisticated
49:21 tribes in this area whatever it is you
49:25 won we don't depict you Pig but you got
49:28 to first go over there and get rid of
49:30 that tribe
49:32 and maybe we'll loan you some weapons
49:34 and you can use them how about a machete
49:36 how about something else but you gotta
49:38 give them back as soon as you're done
49:39 with your workers they can't be
49:40 discovered in your cache well
49:44 potentially living in nature allows us
49:48 to be more begin in tune with nature in
49:51 tune with the world but we don't need a
49:53 super high frequency so if he ever
49:55 wondered how tribes in Africa were
49:59 convinced to help slit you know what is
50:03 it the the Arabs that that harvested the
50:07 slaves to get them ready shackled up and
50:09 ready for the Dutch the Spanish and
50:11 British and there's no was that all the
50:14 British I mean all the European
50:16 countries that put them on boats and
50:17 brought them to America before their
50:20 revolution especially they couldn't see
50:24 the scam they were told some little
50:28 trinket II thing you know hey if you let
50:31 us take you to America you'll get the
50:33 special thing whatever it is they want a
50:35 city of gold and twenty-two virgins or
50:38 whatever it is that they promised them
50:41 because they haven't needed a higher
50:43 frequency because known has been
50:46 exceptionally devious over their current
50:48 frequencies and there's always deception
50:51 somewhere right someone's always telling
50:52 a fib here and there you don't see it
50:56 when I see someone you know and there
51:03 are my family so I'm not pointing a
51:05 finger too far and who you know will
51:08 brag about the Clinton Foundation and
51:10 Hillary Clinton and they're unable to
51:13 see anything related to the Arkansas
51:15 stuff that's been going on they think
51:18 Benghazi happened just exactly the way
51:20 the movie portrayed it which is complete
51:23 revisionist history etc down the line of
51:28 all the rabbit holes they belong to a
51:32 party that has been evil since the very
51:36 beginning though because someone told
51:39 them there was a change in the 70s may
51:42 all sudden think they're on the good
51:43 party because that's where they want to
51:44 be they want to be on the winning
51:46 low frequency but still winning and so
51:51 I've said it several times but this is a
51:53 much better platform to have the
51:55 conversation you can always be duped by
51:58 someone who's smarter than you because
52:01 for every peak in Valley in the little
52:03 sine cosine frequency that you have
52:06 they've got more they are assessing you
52:10 faster it's sort of like their data on
52:13 the enterprise and you're just a normal
52:16 human and this dudes like trillions of
52:18 times faster than you
52:20 just like West world where they can
52:22 predict what you're gonna say before you
52:24 say it and exactly the inflection of
52:26 what you're gonna say it that's because
52:29 the hosts are faster than you and so we
52:33 are in the middle of a crazy situation
52:35 in 2020 here right and there are people
52:39 that are duped and I have some friends
52:41 of mine who in academic realms are
52:45 ridiculously talented and mathematically
52:50 brilliant they know things I may never
52:55 know my entire life even if I won the
52:58 lottery tomorrow I never had to work
52:59 again in my life right but just like
53:04 everything you have that that little
53:08 wheel that's in Trivial Pursuit
53:13 they're like six categories right if you
53:16 have six categories of which I'd say
53:19 that means six or eight I can't remember
53:22 maybe it's eight little categories and
53:25 you could be you know when I play that
53:26 game when it comes to sports I'm I got
53:30 zero I got nothing I just automatically
53:32 take the zero but other ones I do really
53:35 well so your frequency could be super
53:40 duper high in some areas of your life
53:42 and SuperDuper low in other areas of
53:44 your life or it could be that you have
53:47 the central processing unit that's
53:48 really thinking quickly but you can't
53:52 hook your machine that you hooked to the
53:54 motor the program that you run I should
53:56 say in your CPU
53:58 is version 1.0 when it comes to politics
54:03 trying to find out who's good and who's
54:04 bad
54:05 and what I finding is is that logic is
54:10 something that is greatly enabled by a
54:12 higher frequency for those of you who
54:15 seen my episode on quantum computing
54:17 there's a perfect real world analogy for
54:21 what I'm talking about with the human
54:22 mind and soul in this frequency game and
54:25 quantum computing versus sort of linear
54:28 computing if you've ever seen the
54:32 experiment that the demonstration I
54:35 should say that really sells how quantum
54:38 computing is able to work a lot quicker
54:42 than normal computing in in these bigger
54:45 cases they have a maze and unlike a
54:49 normal maze this is more like the forest
54:52 maze like in the shining
54:54 there are several entry points several
54:57 and you have to find either a specific
55:00 exit or more easily thought of like the
55:04 one in the shining there's a center
55:05 courtyard so you have to find the center
55:07 courtyard all the paths are trying to
55:09 obvious get you getting to the center
55:10 center of the maze right on a linear
55:14 system it will have to search and search
55:20 you know that in turn around go around
55:21 search open it in search around it in in
55:23 a quantum computer each qubit gets to
55:28 enter the door and what it does because
55:30 if by nature it's a spinning electron
55:33 that they're actually harvesting numbers
55:36 from they have an infinite number set
55:39 happening almost simultaneously for
55:42 every qubit and so it's able to find
55:45 that Center almost instantaneously every
55:49 single time if you apply machine
55:53 learning to that it may learn how mazes
55:57 are typically constructed to deceive and
55:59 so it will just look down a little
56:01 hallway and go I think it's right here
56:04 boom and it finds it because it's had a
56:07 lot of errors well what is real life
56:11 real life is logic applied to what
56:14 you're experiencing when you drive for
56:18 instance for those of you have driven
56:22 for a little while you'll totally get
56:24 this you're at an intersection and you
56:28 are waiting to turn right now in America
56:32 in most places without a sign you can
56:34 turn right on red any day of the week
56:36 but you gotta look left to make sure no
56:39 one's gonna hit you well there's a funny
56:43 thing for either bad drivers or new
56:45 drivers which is that if you're looking
56:48 at the perpendicular traffic and there's
56:53 someone in front of you to the right
56:54 that's trying to turn left they're gonna
56:56 go by your left a good driver knows that
57:00 as soon as that car finds unless they're
57:02 about to have an accident of course one
57:05 you should just be able look left make
57:06 it happen but there's a way to cheat
57:07 when that car turns left you know that
57:10 they have looked down the street there
57:12 and they've realized no one's coming
57:14 which frees them up to take the left
57:15 turn which means now you can
57:17 simultaneously go right unless they're
57:19 doing a u-turn a curse but you can go
57:21 right and their car if nothing else even
57:23 if they're about to get in a major
57:24 accident as long as it's not a semi and
57:26 it's gonna punch through both of you
57:28 you're gonna be okay and you can go it's
57:32 logic you see the mathematical pattern
57:35 usually from up above you start to see
57:37 the construction when you play video
57:38 games this becomes very natural to you
57:40 when you drive but here's the thing when
57:44 you're driving you could have just a
57:46 brain with one processor it's just a
57:49 gift to look and wait and look in wait
57:53 and look away once you have multiple you
57:56 know processes going through your
57:58 superfast processor even if they only
58:00 have one you can do what's called a
58:02 round-robin and you process every little
58:03 instruction just a little bit every
58:05 second and so more maybe thousands of
58:07 times per second but there's multiple
58:10 things going on got your phone ring and
58:12 you're trying to turn the heater down
58:14 and you're making a right turn you're
58:16 paying attention to the light you're
58:17 paying to the car in front of you you
58:19 are making peeks over here to the left
58:21 you do a bunch of stuff seemingly at the
58:23 same time even though you mmm really
58:26 can't without a lot of muscle memory
58:30 anyway so I think I've seen the people
58:35 with higher frequencies can deceive
58:37 those below us if you do not like being
58:40 on the plane being driven by a bunch of
58:43 low frequency people again it doesn't
58:45 mean they're bad people but you don't
58:48 want to die because they won't let go of
58:51 the controls the pilots dead right they
58:55 won't let go of the controls even though
58:59 you don't know how to fly you at least
59:02 can use everything you've ever seen
59:06 either incidentally on a movie a flight
59:09 simulator that you've played you could
59:11 at least look at the gauges and find out
59:13 okay that Tippi rolly-thing is probably
59:15 our role indicator it's got to be an
59:18 altitude in here somewhere there's
59:19 usually exponential indicators of how
59:21 you know 1,000 times what's in the
59:24 little gauge
59:26 try to find radio to make a call within
59:29 you gotta use all your past radio
59:31 knowledge you know you're gonna move
59:33 really really quick to this process and
59:35 potentially at least increase the odds
59:37 the planes not gonna crash you know if
59:41 you can call down and go I need you to
59:43 land us I need you to put us on
59:44 autopilot everybody's dead here knows
59:46 how to fly a plane I can keep her in the
59:48 air as long as there's fuel tell me
59:51 where not to be tell everybody else that
59:53 we're not following a flight pattern
59:55 anymore there's an assumption although I
59:59 think may be incorrect the evil people
60:03 of the world are low frequency I think
60:07 that's a big mistake I think that simply
60:12 because their taste is so poor with
60:18 their lives that they have reached that
60:22 head point and maybe out of arrogance
60:27 maybe out of just pure ignorance they
60:30 literally lock their consciousness at
60:33 the insanity level and they're just
60:36 sitting there they don't even know
60:37 they're on top of that maybe they don't
60:38 know the metaphor so they can't govern
60:40 it in their brains right some people
60:43 gain weight and they don't realize
60:45 they've gained weight like me when I
60:47 would 2009 when I looked in the mirror
60:49 was like oh my god who the hell is that
60:51 whatever reason I got busy it was just
60:56 about the time I was you know increasing
60:59 here's the beautiful catch-22
61:03 whereas catch-22s are typically very
61:07 synonymous with sort of a cake and eat
61:11 it too but you can only have one we are
61:14 trying to one better the world but when
61:17 you're not doing that it's you're trying
61:18 to better yourself I can tell you that
61:22 when you go from being an average body
61:25 to being the most pumped up version of
61:28 your body that you can make within
61:31 reason
61:34 you feel better about life no matter how
61:38 crappy the world gets you're looking at
61:40 me and you're like at least I look like
61:42 that you know and when you're brighter
61:44 you tend to attract brighter things to
61:47 you
61:48 you definitely track more people to you
61:49 even a business partner and so there's
61:53 this big upgrade going on in your life
61:57 well the same is true for doing that to
62:01 your brain however you have to be aware
62:06 of what you are examining I'll give an
62:10 example that's a little strange but
62:12 you'll understand it right away to make
62:15 sure that we get to the point very
62:17 quickly what if you were hearing this
62:19 conversation and you were a homicide
62:22 police officer law enforcement person
62:26 and so you know you see some pretty
62:29 nasty stuff and it's sort of a game of
62:33 like I pay attention enough to help
62:36 those in need I pay attention enough to
62:39 help lock down the crime case against
62:41 the guilty to get them prosecuted and
62:43 put away out of societies you know
62:46 harm's way sort of thing but then you do
62:50 this detox thing and a year later the
62:55 full psychotic brain of the killer
62:59 becomes extremely easy to understand and
63:02 it starts to get dark and because you're
63:07 seeing things you don't want to see you
63:09 just don't want to know that much about
63:11 these folks and it's a shock to your
63:14 system never seen it before but a year
63:18 goes by you stay in the game you push
63:22 through it now the sudden you're
63:25 developing logic around these
63:28 individuals that commit these kind of
63:30 crimes then you're able to second-guess
63:33 a few things one of the things I learned
63:37 from the Ted Bundy thing was that
63:40 I believe it's Ted revealed that they
63:45 are smart enough because they're
63:46 high-frequency that they leave behind
63:49 false clues to throw off the cops and
63:53 some of these false clues are utterly
63:55 ingenious and so like they make the
63:59 struggle look a different way they take
64:01 a card and deliberately park it and make
64:04 it look like it was abandoned here that
64:06 they went that direction when they're
64:07 doubling back the opposite direction Ted
64:09 Bundy was a genius at this stuff you
64:12 know he could never find this guy until
64:14 after he killed more people and they put
64:16 him in jail and he'd break out or he let
64:18 go and he'd kill more people but he was
64:20 in a totally different place he was an
64:23 artist and the- let me give you another
64:27 one there are several examples of this
64:30 but i'm turning out to go the super dark
64:33 root if you wonder why people do utterly
64:38 bizarre stuff to other people
64:41 and you know nobody knows how frequent
64:45 this stuff is I just saw an interview
64:48 with the sort of former bass player I
64:52 think of scorpions the German guy I
64:55 don't know if he was part of the
64:57 founding members or not I'm not too
64:58 familiar with the band members names
65:00 besides the lead singer actually was
65:05 friends with the the second drummer for
65:07 a while but this bass player guy goes
65:11 I've been to some parties and I assumes
65:13 the team's the interview he goes I'm
65:14 innocent parties and saw some really
65:17 crazy [ __ ] and they said well what did
65:19 you see and he goes you know I think I
65:23 think I saw I'm pretty sure they killed
65:25 people at this party
65:27 it was super sick and I think you said
65:31 something about people paying $100,000
65:34 to see this sort of thing you sit there
65:37 and you wonder people who touch kids and
65:40 people just do all those uh turley crazy
65:43 Eyes Wide Shut stuff right I mean the
65:46 super bad stuff that wasn't in the movie
65:49 and part of it could be a combination of
65:53 a few very simple simple things it seems
65:57 to be the higher we go in the ruling
65:59 class meaning money and resources they
66:04 love these Maria Abramovich kind of
66:07 people and she's there to serve them and
66:09 she figured out where her bread was
66:12 buttered and as she's done a Microsoft
66:14 commercial it was taken down but they've
66:17 done let's just say you were born into
66:20 one of these aristocratic families and
66:22 everything that they could imagine that
66:24 they would want to do I'm gonna say by
66:28 the age of 30 they've done it I have a
66:33 friend of mine that told me a story
66:35 this person was deep in Hollywood and I
66:38 mean deep here in Los Angeles and they
66:43 told me that they went to this person's
66:46 house and it was one of the Rockefeller
66:47 or sorry one of the Rothschild kids
66:49 excuse me and he was obviously in a bad
66:55 situation but he didn't need to work he
66:58 had a mansion he had the cars he had
67:01 people coming in and out girls guys
67:03 whatever I guess he was a huge coke
67:05 addict at the time this was many years
67:08 ago but the dude's life was clearly
67:13 exhausted you want more cocaine mr. Roth
67:16 ja how much do you want there's no limit
67:19 for you anything that you want you want
67:22 a new car you want a custom Bugatti that
67:25 cost twelve million dollars yeah we'll
67:27 get we'll get you two in fact he'll
67:29 never drive a car that's not custom-made
67:30 for you you'll never have to wear the
67:33 same clothes twice you can go to any
67:35 party any restaurant in the world we
67:38 will get you a custom-made you know what
67:41 is it
67:43 g 5 g 6 g 7 g 22 whatever and we can fly
67:48 there at Mach you want to eat lunch in
67:52 Paris and then go to sleep in New York
67:55 again next day you're in Le no problem
67:58 well what would you do if you got
68:00 completely bored of all options in life
68:03 that are the options that you and I
68:05 consider to be super duper privileged
68:07 things to experience which is sadly
68:10 materialistic of course and someone says
68:13 would you like to see something really
68:15 crazy and the dudes you know coming down
68:18 off some coke I about to go up on
68:20 another coke I may be an ecstasy high or
68:22 whatever cuz oh yeah sure man maybe at
68:27 this point through drugs he's brought
68:28 his frequency down that's where they get
68:31 into all these crazy things it's the
68:34 only game in town that is new and the
68:36 more sick and crazy and insane
68:39 it gets instead of loving love you love
68:43 pain perhaps you love hate you love
68:47 suffering and because drugs are drugs
68:51 well you can drink somebody's blood and
68:54 get that total adrenaline high because
68:56 they were just murdered two seconds ago
68:58 there's tons of celebrities that have
69:01 been in very compromising situations
69:05 just say that right a lot of really
69:09 famous straight guys will be known for
69:14 having at least an era in their life
69:16 where they went to the other side well
69:20 maybe they were just able to sleep with
69:22 every brilliantly gorgeous woman they
69:25 could possibly get their hands on and
69:26 now the only thing they haven't done is
69:28 sleep with their own sex just as simple
69:31 but here's the sad thing coming from the
69:35 little town that I came from by being at
69:38 a particular level let's stick with
69:41 aristocratic level because it's much
69:43 easier it's like the volume knob on ten
69:45 right they got everything they want all
69:47 the money everything you know I've met
69:50 some people that are really really high
69:53 I mean I've met one family that is
69:55 categorically a
69:56 upper upper class old money and lots of
69:59 it seem to be very very centered
70:03 individuals you know but let's say that
70:08 you're born at that level and then
70:09 there's expectations imposed on you
70:12 imagine being one of the two sons of you
70:15 know Prince Charles and and princes die
70:20 you're not allowed at those levels
70:24 whether it be a banker family or wealthy
70:26 family to engage in lower things on the
70:31 class structure what do I mean by that
70:33 you see this dramatized in movies every
70:36 one small I said a long long time ago
70:38 one of the things one of the sights I
70:40 used to see in my home town especially
70:41 when I visited cuz it meant more to me
70:43 when I was visiting I'd left a
70:44 comfortable small slow cycle city or
70:49 it's like 30 to 40 miles an hour is the
70:51 top speed and I came out to the city and
70:53 it was like God you cops are passing you
70:55 at 80 and they're not pulling you over I
70:57 went back and I saw one I remembered the
71:01 life I grew up with and so that was like
71:03 well that's that was these guys are
71:05 winning right the old men sitting on
71:08 porches Social Security pays for the
71:11 house no big deal and they're just
71:14 carving wood got a fishing pole they use
71:17 you know three or four times a week and
71:20 they just go in in the wintertime they
71:22 shovel the snow they live just a
71:25 beautiful simple life they live with
71:28 their spouse until one of them dies and
71:31 then a lot of times they go together you
71:34 know within a week or two of each other
71:38 those people are winning with the
71:40 lessons more formula to life I mentioned
71:45 that at the end here because for me
71:49 maybe just like I criticize from time to
71:54 time the notion that man thinks that
71:56 they're so sophisticated but we're not
72:00 because man has figured out how to use
72:03 computers and like-minded instruments to
72:07 accelerate invention we feel like we
72:12 should be at the highest apex that we
72:15 have discovered now and there's a lot of
72:18 shadow inventions we're not allowed to
72:19 have because it competes with
72:21 corporations but save that exception if
72:26 a TV can be bigger it's supposed to be
72:28 bigger if horsepower and an average car
72:31 gets higher because it's possible at an
72:35 affordable level then your car is
72:37 supposed to have 400 horsepower it's not
72:40 allowed to have 150 horsepower and I got
72:42 friends of mine that are like grown-up
72:45 children who will think that every car
72:50 you buy is supposed to have a lap time a
72:53 quarter-mile time 0-60 time and you just
72:58 kinda look at them and you're like it's
73:00 a luxury car why the hell should I worry
73:02 about racing what are you [ __ ] 14
73:05 years old right so you know maturity
73:11 overlaid on this game prevents you in my
73:14 opinion from finding the true happy
73:18 frequency in life and the one thing that
73:20 I would love to know like one of the God
73:22 facts I'd love to know are the history
73:25 of these individuals these male-female
73:27 couples in the modern age that are
73:31 sitting on a porch realizing that
73:33 they've struck paydirt they just love
73:37 their lives and they realized this is it
73:40 man at the Bundy ranch sort of thing
73:41 right so my question to myself is do I
73:46 need and the individuals need to go from
73:50 bottom to top to medium is that the way
73:55 we appreciate what we have and you sit
73:58 there on the porch and you know let's
74:01 just say I you know we're to move back
74:04 to my hometown at 60
74:07 and I've done all these things I've done
74:09 and now I'm like 80 20 years later
74:12 haven't done anything significant in the
74:14 pop culture world for 20 years but I've
74:17 loved every second of it nah maybe I
74:19 live another 20 years get to 100 right
74:21 but some kid might drive by and look at
74:25 me on the porch not get it and go man I
74:27 hope I'm never like that guy and it's
74:30 exactly what I said to myself maybe when
74:33 I was younger I very quickly understood
74:36 that was a pretty cool game but you go
74:38 out to get your bone you go out to prove
74:40 to the world who you are you prove to
74:42 yourself who you are you got to have
74:44 those experiences to check them off your
74:46 list and in that kid and so ironic loop
74:50 of life is back on that bench the same
74:54 one same house same porch at 80 years
74:58 old I'm long dead and the dudes like
75:02 talking to me as a spirit you know and
75:04 he's like I'm gonna keep the seat warm
75:05 for both of us have a seat man and I'm
75:08 sitting there and spiritually just doing
75:10 I'm like a beetle just do it I'm doing
75:11 the same thing right next to him right
75:13 just as a digression for those of you
75:17 haven't moved a lot in life like a
75:20 thousand plus miles away from where you
75:22 grew up one that's probably a cool idea
75:24 to be honest you're not losing man trust
75:27 me but the one thing that gets well the
75:32 only thing I noticed that when I was in
75:33 the Midwest we had you know pollen
75:36 season we're in on big pollen season
75:38 right now I woke up my eyes were all
75:39 watery today and my buddy came in he
75:41 goes oh we got the pollen blast today I
75:43 was like oh that's why my body's
75:47 acclimating right now but I definitely
75:51 you know the winters and summers are
75:53 really different in certain areas of the
75:55 world and I'm in a place now that's just
75:57 pretty steady you know the winners are
76:00 getting way colder I will say that in
76:02 the summers aren't warming up like they
76:03 used to so again we've had the shortest
76:06 summer last year that I have ever had in
76:08 California in my life
76:10 and this the winners are pretty brutal
76:13 as well just so I was out here recording
76:15 at 38 degrees for you guys today is nice
76:19 today it must be like 65 out here it's
76:22 beautiful so when I think about moving
76:24 around the world again it's always
76:26 battling the elements again and don't
76:28 you okay I got used to my car icing up
76:34 black ice on the roads SuperDuper hot
76:38 summers where you got to get inside you
76:40 gotta get air-conditioned so as you live
76:44 your life play with this theory you know
76:46 I think there's obviously in my own
76:50 biology I've seen this become
76:52 categorically true my fear for the young
76:58 people this world is that they're being
77:00 raised with such WTO food that yeah and
77:06 they're indoctrinated to get
77:07 vaccinations and that kind of stuff
77:09 which will just it's going to be the
77:12 catastrophic sterilization event of the
77:14 century
77:16 you know the fact that Bill Gates has
77:18 participated in funding vaccinations in
77:22 Africa that sterilized women and he
77:25 doesn't seem to have any you know moral
77:29 remorse for that means that that was his
77:32 goal he's kinda below of course you know
77:35 and private he would most likely say
77:37 something like that which is why denies
77:39 it in public
77:40 but again the nurses that took care of
77:42 these women know a hundred percent it's
77:44 true
77:45 it really did happen so I fear that you
77:49 know the the deep state always attacks
77:51 the youth of this world so if you have
77:53 children it's up to you to protect them
77:56 but they're trying to indoctrinate us
77:59 down you need synthetics to be normal in
78:04 this world well go watch the old videos
78:08 from you know the I forgot the name of
78:12 the series is but it's the videos of the
78:14 people from the 1800s in their 90's and
78:17 hundreds being interviewed and a video
78:20 made like 1910 or 1905 was sound
78:24 man and they brought all these people
78:25 together to film them because they
78:27 realize we're going to talk to our
78:28 elders we're gonna get them on tape and
78:31 they're all completely sentient this one
78:34 woman was was celebrating there are a
78:37 hundred hundred birthday or a hundred
78:39 and third birthday and she was in like a
78:41 wooden wheel chair thing you know the
78:44 kind of they can push around like a
78:45 wheel chair it looks like a rocking
78:46 chair kind of thing and she demanded to
78:49 get up and dance with an old man for her
78:53 birthday what do you see that nowadays
78:56 right you don't we give so few people
79:00 they're older and they're older today
79:01 because they skipped all the bad food I
79:04 just recently saw well I think it was a
79:06 British woman it was a hundred and six
79:08 who they said survive this karana thing
79:11 and my god they interviewed her and she
79:14 was just like her heads moving her
79:15 eyeballs look completely young I mean in
79:17 terms of like you know usually when he
79:19 hit a hundred your eyeballs kind of
79:20 turned into like Watto eyeballs so it
79:23 was completely lucid she was born in I
79:29 think it was 1913 because she's going to
79:34 turn 107 this year crazy so the thing is
79:39 is if you do experiment with
79:40 detoxification and you may have already
79:42 done it and you're perfectly fine now
79:44 or you do anything to speed up your mind
79:46 which again is solving complex problems
79:49 problems they don't have easy solutions
79:51 you have to think you know if you're
79:53 writing story trust me you're gonna
79:55 think like you've never thought in your
79:57 life you want to write a poem or write a
79:59 book or and if you care about the words
80:01 that you choose anything that you do you
80:04 do anything you make would you write
80:07 code if you care about its beauty and
80:09 its simplicity and its and its balance
80:12 you're gonna be stimulating every
80:14 chamber of your mind if you used to play
80:17 an instrument and you still own one but
80:19 you haven't picked it up in 20 years you
80:21 know your body does change so if you
80:23 play a trumpet it might be a little
80:24 tough but if you played the violin or
80:25 something I mean there's old guys
80:27 playing fiddles all around the world you
80:28 know so maybe we get it back out do
80:30 whatever you got to do but you may find
80:34 that you don't like it
80:36 you're perfectly comfortable with who
80:37 you are don't need anything else
80:39 so go that route too but be comfortable
80:42 in your own skin realize yeah yeah I'm
80:47 already where I want to be and hey
80:49 that's a victory statement that is a
80:52 victory statement that's the statement a
80:53 lot of us younger folks are trying to
80:55 get to where is it what is the frequency
80:57 I want you know when you tune the radio
80:59 and you tune the radio and you're like
81:01 well that sounds alright but I don't
81:03 really want to listen to that kind of
81:04 music and you keep going and finally
81:05 when you find this sweet spot it's your
81:07 favorite song then you got a little bit
81:09 of micro tuning to get it in as rich as
81:12 it could be I mean oh kids don't
81:15 experience out this day these days but I
81:17 think that's it interested in your
81:20 thoughts let me know what you think and
81:23 on that note if you haven't been to deep
