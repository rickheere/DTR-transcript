00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts it's slightly windy
00:41 outside shooting chemtrails a little bit
00:44 today it's been a while since I've been
00:47 able to do an episode because I was out
00:49 of the country for about 10 days we want
00:52 bidness definitely good to be home
00:56 so I got all these ideas all these
00:58 amazing suggestions from you guys and
01:00 I'm gonna try to make season four as
01:03 much your suggestions as humanly
01:07 possible and the only time I will not be
01:10 able to get to your suggestion would be
01:12 if I already done it or I can't figure
01:15 out a way to do a whole hour around it
01:17 but today we're gonna talk about
01:19 something called something I'm gonna
01:21 call faux justice which means fake now
01:27 this has been going on for a very long
01:28 time way beyond any of our lifespans but
01:33 now as we are bringing justice to many
01:36 corrupt factions in this world it is
01:39 extremely important that you're aware of
01:40 what I'm about to tell you because
01:42 people I think justice is about to fall
01:46 like a hammer I think we've already seen
01:48 some amazing things q and on predicting
01:52 not only the day but the exact minute
01:57 that John McCain was pronounced dead
02:01 supposedly it's like 428 in the
02:05 afternoon
02:06 30 days after a post that said he's
02:10 gonna meet his end in 30 days he's gonna
02:12 be in the kill box in 30 days and the
02:15 post was posted exactly at the same time
02:17 that he died 30 days later I mean it's
02:19 just unbelievable how real this is
02:20 getting now again they could be fiddling
02:23 with boards and changing timetables on
02:26 previous posts but everything is
02:28 archived heavily and screenshotted so
02:33 there's any finagling with numbers the
02:35 whole thing would come down quick right
02:38 what's that to do with faux justice
02:42 faux justice happens in so many
02:46 different ways
02:48 but it's the exact same formula at all
02:50 times what happens when someone is
02:53 caught stealing or killing someone or
02:56 reaping someone or doing something
02:58 horrible I mean really at that horrible
03:00 level Society wants them to be taken out
03:04 because they are going to probably
03:06 repeat their behavior and we don't want
03:10 them to do that because eventually it'll
03:11 come back to us and empathetically we
03:13 understand the value of do no harm
03:17 because we understand what we don't want
03:19 to have happen to us right and so we
03:21 want to have proof that the person or
03:26 persons involved in a particular crime
03:29 of a particular type receive punishment
03:32 that we believe is congruent with what
03:35 they the damage they did right yeah some
03:39 of those just to digress for one second
03:41 some of these punishments you know it's
03:42 it's hard to get the layman to
03:45 understand some things you know if
03:47 someone sticks a knife and your neighbor
03:48 and your wife and she dies then you you
03:52 know the ultimate capital punishment in
03:54 return for that which is you took a life
03:56 and you lose your life what I think is
04:00 hard is people pedaling like really
04:03 hardcore drugs not marijuana but like
04:06 bags of heroine bags of cocaine you know
04:10 a one bag of cocaine one bag of heroin
04:12 specially heroin can utterly destroy
04:16 lifes you know coke is now usually in
04:19 crack form destroys life so one little
04:22 cellophane bag is destroying potentially
04:24 with the little rocks in there dozens
04:28 and dozens of lifes and so when you hear
04:30 people getting arrested for drug
04:32 possession or drug not possession as
04:34 chilly but drug with possession with the
04:35 intent to deal Society doesn't
04:39 understand these ten year sentences 20
04:41 year sentences against that now weed
04:43 give me a break
04:46 if if putting someone to jail for owning
04:50 weed makes any sense to you then you
04:53 should prosecute everyone who owns a
04:55 beer you know but there is a way for
04:58 people to get completely off completely
05:02 out of any criminal prosecution through
05:07 this faux Justice techniques that I'm
05:08 going to share with you and you've seen
05:11 them your entire life but what's really
05:13 fascinating is I will sit in rooms with
05:15 guys you know from their 70s down and
05:19 they've never put it together
05:22 it's amazing they've never added you
05:25 know one plus one and said holy crap
05:28 you're right there this is fake justice
05:31 there's your setup now here's your punch
05:34 now we're going to discuss each and in
05:36 each individual enactment of this whole
05:40 thing when you see a Senate hearing
05:44 where they're chewing out somebody like
05:46 Lois Lerner who ran the IRS under
05:49 Obama's camp and chased all the
05:51 conservative groups you know just
05:55 splitting hairs and making sure everyone
05:57 was being punished
05:58 that's fake justice when struck the
06:05 douchebag with all the text messages
06:06 gets pulled into the Senate and oh my
06:10 god did he ever ask act like some prancy
06:12 little princess
06:15 that's fake justice you might be hip to
06:20 that one let's keep going
06:23 when you see a show like The Daily Show
06:28 on Comedy Central
06:30 where everything's pretty much an
06:32 opinion piece straight to the camera
06:35 this dialogue has have been crafted to
06:37 turn everything into jokes but everyone
06:38 small they'll break and they really rake
06:41 someone over the coals and really expose
06:43 what they did on TV and everyone laughs
06:47 that's part of the fake justice system
06:49 when you hear a talk show talk radio on
06:53 your on your in your car radio and
06:56 you're hearing someone
06:59 bring it up and they're so angry in
07:01 there I mean they're literally just on
07:02 the verge of cursing on the air and they
07:07 got you all riled up and they have all
07:10 these guests on who are other
07:12 politicians maybe even law enforcement
07:15 in some cases and they're all in
07:17 agreeance fake justice if you go to
07:23 Barnes & Noble or your local bookstore
07:26 digital or analog or whatever and you
07:30 see a book that is taking them to the
07:32 cleaners
07:33 you know Roger stones books on the
07:35 Clintons take it him to the cleaners
07:37 write books on Obama or whatever books
07:42 on Trump and you have to have a crime
07:44 all of that including op-ed pieces on
07:50 the news or maybe Lou Dobbs goes nuts or
07:55 Rachel Maddow goes nuts maybe even
07:59 attacks their own party let's vote
08:02 justice but why is this faux justice the
08:07 formula has been carefully designed and
08:09 carefully orchestrated and the Senate is
08:11 your absolute pivotal moment where this
08:13 is actually done I got a [ __ ] car
08:16 alarm a helicopter and a goddamn
08:18 icecream shot going off all at the same
08:19 time
08:20 holy [ __ ] let's see if we can get a
08:22 fourth in here the Senate hearing is
08:25 where you really see it which is to say
08:31 look at how much we're going to rake
08:33 these [ __ ] over the coal you
08:36 don't need to worry about these
08:39 criminals anymore people because the
08:41 Senate is on it right look at what we're
08:45 doing work we have them on camera on
08:48 c-span tree Gowdy has given them a
08:51 colonoscopy up to his elbow and they're
08:55 just duking it out man that son of a
08:57 [ __ ] that you know whatever diet that
08:59 uh call him whatever names you want
09:02 they're getting that you know the third
09:04 degree the reality is they're walking
09:09 out of that [ __ ] room and not a
09:10 goddamn thing is happening to
09:12 the Lois Lerner who sat there and
09:15 pleaded v like 55 [ __ ] times or
09:18 something unbelievable still is free
09:22 committed absolutely egregious [ __ ]
09:26 crimes using the Internal Revenue
09:28 Service which is a [ __ ] organization
09:32 invented by the sixteenth Amendment of
09:33 the Constitution by the [ __ ]
09:36 who wrote the sixteenth Amendment so
09:40 they could take all of our money
09:43 corporations used to pay all the taxes
09:45 in this country now they pay none and we
09:47 pay everything else it's a way that they
09:50 get themselves expunged removed from all
09:54 the the eyes of the people and they walk
09:58 scot-free and because we buy this
10:01 paradigm as true justice in our brain we
10:06 feel like we've been satiated in our
10:08 chest oh my god I saw that Strock guy he
10:11 got it he got what he needed
10:13 of course the libs are sitting there on
10:14 the other side going look at how he
10:16 defended himself mm-hmm doesn't matter
10:21 though at some point someone you dislike
10:23 will be in that seat getting you know
10:26 heavily questioned man ask anybody in
10:29 jail for with a life sentence if they
10:32 trave a life sentence for being heavily
10:35 questioned on TV how does talk radio
10:39 help well I used to live in the Bay Area
10:41 which is San Francisco California for
10:44 those of you don't know that reference
10:45 and you know they'll tell you how
10:48 virtuous they are and how tolerant they
10:50 are but they are the most vocal haters
10:54 of all things on planet Earth
10:56 you know you got people who hate gays up
10:59 there which just blows your mind again
11:01 I've never seen more homophobia and hate
11:04 crime [ __ ] going on then and when I was
11:07 in San Francisco but they're extremely
11:10 political all of their radio stations
11:12 are just like pure [ __ ] battery acid
11:16 and it's not like every town every big
11:18 city doesn't have one of those but Jesus
11:20 up there it was really palpable and you
11:22 just could close your eyes and hit seek
11:25 on your
11:25 in the 90s and man you could just bump
11:28 into something going crazy but let's
11:32 just say that the president of United
11:34 States or some person who shouldn't be
11:36 committing crimes is committing crimes
11:39 getting caught for things like Clinton
11:40 you know pulling his dick out in front
11:42 everybody among other things and you
11:47 feel like oh my god you know or as our
11:49 leadership really losing it
11:51 and of course if the community that
11:55 you're in is a general supporter of the
11:57 president the United States or whatever
11:59 it's easy to pick on these individuals
12:02 because they're so high up in the
12:03 country and this is where the layer of
12:06 [ __ ] happens then if you turn on the
12:10 radio and everyone's yelling at that
12:11 person then you feel seated that
12:15 something is occurring well I can go to
12:16 bed because people are taking care of it
12:22 sometimes that happens and sometimes
12:24 these rallies and these radio stations
12:27 actually get you know like a governor to
12:30 lose we had a governor in California
12:34 named Gray Davis who was blamed for a
12:37 ton of [ __ ] he had no control over one
12:40 of the big things was the brownouts the
12:43 power brownouts that were happening in
12:45 california and we were being sanctioned
12:47 in california about where we bought our
12:48 power we were trying to buy clean
12:50 hydroelectric power from Canada and
12:52 there was some some injunction from the
12:54 White House to say we had to buy US
12:56 Enron power and they charged us 40 to 50
13:00 times as much for the power we caught
13:03 them with you know audio recordings with
13:06 conference calls talk about how they
13:08 were jacking up the power and how they
13:09 were making power plants go down for
13:11 maintenance I mean it was a cabal of
13:13 cabal's that has come and gone and no
13:16 one [ __ ] remembers it and it's
13:20 because of this faux justice this the
13:23 reason why Enron not only disappeared
13:26 from you know people's stock portfolios
13:29 and their 401ks and screwed every went
13:30 over but the actual crimes that should
13:33 probably put several employees into
13:34 prison for the rest of their lives
13:37 they're all free today
13:40 because talk-radio made it feel like
13:43 somebody was gonna do some well surely
13:45 somebody's gonna get [ __ ] persecuted
13:47 for this look how angry here listen to
13:49 how angry people are on the radio look
13:51 at c-span look at oh man look at trey
13:52 Gowdy he's going crazy all I got to say
13:56 is if you're a senator and you're
13:57 participating in these faux [ __ ]
14:00 kangaroo court things and you're not
14:02 really pressing charges in the end then
14:05 you're aiding and abetting and colluding
14:07 with those that you're yelling at you
14:12 are now granted sometimes individuals
14:16 don't have the power to even bring up
14:18 the notion of pressing charges like a
14:20 talk radio person can't go to a
14:22 citizen's arrest on an Enron executive
14:26 necessarily so we do have to have people
14:28 of the given authority to be informed
14:33 that there perhaps is a criminal charge
14:35 that could be filed but that's where we
14:37 work together as a society to correlate
14:40 our information to say is this a crime
14:44 or is this not a crime hey if it's not
14:45 and we just simply don't have a law to
14:48 protect this particular little loophole
14:49 okay well shame on us second time shame
14:53 on them but does get that law passed
14:55 right there's always loopholes you know
14:59 mafias find used to find them back in
15:01 the 40s and 50s now government agencies
15:04 find them help their buddies out their
15:06 cronies insider trading stuff you know
15:09 sometimes these books will come out you
15:11 know I think I haven't read any of
15:13 Oliver Stone's books all the way through
15:15 but definitely taken some some pages out
15:18 and read through and he's very vicious
15:22 in his book he's pretty thorough I've
15:24 got tons of books in my house about the
15:27 Croatian drug traffic in the KLA I've
15:30 got books about the coup of Russia
15:32 Michael Rupert's book crossing the
15:35 Rubicon
15:36 these books are exhaustively documenting
15:39 global crime international crime savings
15:45 and loan scanner which John McCain was a
15:47 big part of
15:50 you didn't go to jail because he was a
15:53 senator they said he didn't you know
15:56 intentionally colluded with the biggest
15:57 Ponzi scheme guy out of Arizona but he
16:01 didn't four other guys were involved
16:05 with literally one of the largest
16:06 Savings and Loan scandals now there was
16:09 there were tons of those scandals going
16:11 on at the time but he was part of one of
16:13 the biggest ones never served any time
16:16 but had they caught him and someone said
16:19 we're gonna have to press charges on you
16:21 or we're gonna have to at least get the
16:23 public to think that we've done
16:24 something he would have ended up in a
16:26 Senate hearing said he doesn't recall 50
16:31 times maybe we plead the fifth two times
16:32 and leave what are the other elements of
16:36 these Senate hearings because city
16:37 hearings are where it becomes complete
16:39 [ __ ] and what I need you to do from
16:41 this point on in your life in your
16:42 country or in this country the United
16:44 States of America is when you see these
16:46 things you need to call [ __ ] in the
16:49 room to anyone who's an adult who can
16:53 hear obviously children know but you can
16:54 you can even tell kids you know a kid
16:56 see what they're doing here it's all
16:58 fake it's all fake no charges pressed
17:00 these people gonna walk away free but we
17:03 know they're guilty and we're sitting
17:04 there talking about the individual
17:06 points of their guilt but the other
17:09 thing they do is they bring these people
17:11 into a Senate hearing if they don't put
17:14 them under oath for those of you who are
17:17 unfamiliar with exactly what that means
17:19 that means that if you tell a lie under
17:21 oath then you are now perjuring yourself
17:25 meaning you're officially deeming
17:29 yourself a liar and criminal prosecution
17:33 can be put against you if they believe
17:37 the lie is obstructing justice now you
17:41 would never want to go in under oath
17:42 without an attorney without some general
17:45 idea of what kind of questions are going
17:47 to be answering so you can prepare your
17:48 answers like I said in a previous
17:50 episode the sistership episode you'll be
17:53 very careful never talking to any
17:57 government agency under oath because if
17:59 you so much as get a single fact
18:00 incorrect they can use that to say
18:04 you're a liar and they can start
18:06 pressing charges on you and it could be
18:09 as petty as what day did you take your
18:11 clothes to the dry cleaners what day did
18:13 you pick them up if you do not know the
18:17 answer
18:18 unequivocally perfectly you just say I
18:21 don't know the exact answer I think it
18:24 was this but it could have been that a
18:26 lot of times these these questions
18:30 sessions are soft-handed you've heard
18:37 the old phrase a softball question it
18:40 means that the question really doesn't
18:42 get at the meat of anything a lot of
18:44 times Senate hearings are
18:46 meet-and-greets
18:47 a lot of times it's people coming in and
18:51 saying well thank you for serving your
18:53 your country okay no right that's what I
18:57 do I try to serve okay great see you
18:59 later all right bye-bye
19:00 nothing ever happens no meat is ever
19:03 found on the bone when they do closed
19:07 sessions oftentimes there's no
19:11 transcript of what is asked and what the
19:13 answers are they'll cite national
19:16 security or some other horseshit
19:18 after 9/11 there were a lot of hearings
19:21 and I think you'll remember that I think
19:25 Dick Cheney and President Bush George
19:30 Bush jr. went in and and talked to the
19:34 Senate and these other intelligence
19:36 committees and what-have-you but they
19:38 said I will only go in if it's not
19:41 televised not transcribed to the public
19:43 and if I'm not under oath well Jesus
19:48 okay what the [ __ ] is the point of the
19:50 meeting you can lie you can [ __ ] and
19:55 nothing has to happen in the meeting
19:57 right but the public especially the more
20:01 official story these sort of baby
20:03 boomers are they'll tell you oh well
20:05 they had hearings about that you know
20:07 nothing came out of it so there must not
20:08 be any crimes because that's my hero up
20:10 there you know some of you will be old
20:15 enough to remember the Iran
20:17 entre affair you had a it's it feels to
20:21 me like it was a pre-existing program
20:23 that it was well in effect by 1980 when
20:27 Ronald Reagan took took the office of
20:29 presidency maybe he took that in 81 but
20:33 he got involved he took over the the job
20:36 of supreme commander of United States
20:38 right and there was this guns for money
20:42 thing going on drugs from anything going
20:45 on was the guns for drugs and drugs get
20:47 sold you know and a lot of reagan went
20:50 in there after Ollie north went up there
20:53 I mean Holly North is so [ __ ] involved
20:56 with this it's crazy
20:58 he's like the kingpin of the entire
21:00 [ __ ] project and he never served a day
21:03 in jail you got talk show after talk
21:06 show cuz they just reward these guys for
21:09 keeping this [ __ ] going book deal after
21:11 book deal poor Ronald Reagan's walking
21:13 in there you're going you know Jesus
21:16 it's bad enough I'm not even president
21:18 even though I am president it'll run
21:19 anything they shot me the second I
21:22 investigated the Federal Reserve or at
21:25 least fake that and then told me this
21:28 shit's gonna go down for real if you
21:29 don't ease off dude but he has to sit
21:34 there and say I don't recall I don't
21:36 recall I don't recall cuz that's the
21:37 defense it's a soft way of saying I'm
21:41 not gonna tell you what you want to know
21:43 and everyone can forget right it's a
21:46 biological thing I don't wanna Reagan
21:49 became president I believe it's 70 years
21:51 old so he's now he's in his 70s and he
21:54 can just lean on dementia which
21:56 supposedly he died of did not have to
22:00 serve any crime right I believe it was
22:03 2003 here in the United States in Santa
22:07 Monica California we have a pier where
22:11 we have a Sarah we have a promenade
22:12 where cars are supposed to go people you
22:14 know it's all blocked off by these big
22:16 cement pillars but somehow this old man
22:19 80 something years old starts plowing
22:23 through [ __ ] people I think he killed
22:25 eight people and injured dozens and
22:28 dozens of people
22:30 when he got out of his car someone
22:32 yelled at him and said what the [ __ ] are
22:34 you doing and he said well you should
22:37 have got out of my way this dude never
22:41 served a day in jail because he's simply
22:43 his family okay so that he was crazy
22:47 said that he was getting so old you know
22:49 he could drive a [ __ ] car that's okay
22:52 I'm sure he has licence pulled after
22:53 that one but they just said oh he's an
22:56 old man who just you know I had a bad
22:59 day driving it's like mmm the guy gets
23:04 out of the car and says we should have
23:05 got out of my way he's an [ __ ] that
23:08 should die behind bars period and any
23:14 family members got people that are
23:15 driving past their age of you know
23:19 cognitive awareness should think about
23:22 it well you know the guy from that if he
23:24 goes grandma goes crazy and she's gonna
23:26 end up in jail and she's gonna die in
23:28 there so let's take away our license
23:29 before that happens right again faux
23:32 justice right so what happens with
23:36 comedy shows why are there so many
23:39 goddamn comedy shows out there that are
23:41 politically oriented well your first
23:44 assumption is probably correct as well
23:46 which is it's to curve narrative rights
23:49 to create narrative and to you know say
23:53 hey we're cool over here you're laughing
23:55 and we're sarcastic and we seem so
23:57 brilliant over here and so you should
24:01 come our way because they there's
24:02 nothing to worry about or worry about
24:03 pedophilia in Hollywood hey let's make a
24:06 bunch of let's have Sarah Silverman on
24:08 to make a bunch of really racy jokes
24:11 about raping children and then it'll be
24:15 okay but there are rants on these shows
24:18 aren't they aren't there right it's
24:21 another one of these things of we have
24:24 to synthesize the idea that we're mad as
24:27 hell we're not going to take it anymore
24:29 from all these different eras I mean all
24:31 these different arenas right if they're
24:34 doing it in the Senate there's books
24:35 being written about it in Barnes & Noble
24:37 I turned on my radio and they're yelling
24:39 about the same exact thing and The Daily
24:41 Show or shows like that
24:43 are yelling and screaming about it well
24:47 I think we've got it right
24:49 in fact I'm even tired of hearing about
24:50 this that's another good algorithm I
24:53 don't want to hear about Barack Obama
24:56 being born in Kenya anymore I don't how
24:58 many times you heard that one I don't
25:00 care if he was completely a [ __ ]
25:02 illegal President of the United States
25:04 right sit to Harvard by one of the most
25:07 evil [ __ ] Prince's in Saudi Arabia so
25:11 what do we do about this photo justice
25:15 because it's continuing and it's going
25:17 to continue until we call it out
25:21 well the narrative that we have to start
25:24 creating between us and I hate to even
25:26 use that word because it seems fictional
25:28 but the dialogue that needs to start
25:30 surfacing is the dialogue about this
25:33 particular subject you can probably do a
25:38 much better job articulating it than I
25:39 can in terms of saying Senate hearings
25:42 are complete [ __ ] if it does not
25:45 lead to [ __ ] charges that they
25:47 discuss in the hearing then don't have
25:50 it because you're all getting paid to do
25:51 something that is complete [ __ ]
25:54 right
25:55 you're wasting Americans money or
25:58 whatever country you live in
25:59 again the British Parliament under David
26:04 Cameron who I will mistakenly call James
26:07 Cameron from time to time on the show I
26:09 do apologize nothing against mr. James
26:12 Cameron quite the opposite
26:14 but David Cameron sat in front of the
26:16 British Parliament when asked about the
26:20 sexual charges of pedophilia by one of
26:23 their head cabinet members there had
26:26 Parliament members I should say he
26:29 refused to answer the question and he
26:34 just sat down with his little notepad
26:35 and they humped right just like Blazing
26:39 Saddles Blazing Saddles they humped and
26:41 her rump and he just sat there and was
26:43 like isn't it nice that you can't do a
26:47 goddamn thing about it I told you how
26:49 it's gonna be and that's the way it's
26:50 gonna be because I visited the Queen
26:52 earlier today and she told me what to
26:53 say and then you think in the back of a
26:56 well maybe that guy got
26:57 justise anyway that you know david
26:59 cameron didn't want to go out there and
27:00 embarrass the country that they have
27:02 allowed unfortunately someone from
27:05 Parliament's who get this far into boy
27:08 touching but then the case like I said
27:13 in previous episode they assigned it to
27:14 his sister the the judge or whatever it
27:17 was the guy who had the charges against
27:19 him they appointed his sister to head up
27:21 the investigation and she dropped all
27:23 charges dropped the case altogether guy
27:26 got away scot [ __ ] free right jimmy
27:29 savile died having done everything that
27:32 he wanted to do never paid for anything
27:35 and that's typically how they
27:37 orchestrated well though they're on to
27:40 Prince Andrew and his visits to Lolita
27:43 Island and no one knew what a Lolita
27:45 Island was until Q went on came around
27:47 and then now we all know that's a person
27:50 and juries starting to look really bad
27:52 we got photographs with him with young
27:54 girls his wife in the background that
27:56 young girl ends up showing up with Bill
27:59 Clinton the rapper Eminem a bunch of
28:02 folks she seems to be this little doll
28:04 that gets passed around between these
28:06 guys right but they look at his life
28:09 span they say yeah well he's like he's
28:11 60 alright well it's uh this we can keep
28:14 it going for 20 years right with the
28:16 attorneys from the royal family yeah
28:18 sure and they can't press any charges
28:19 cuz he's royalty so there you go they
28:22 can talk about it and they get to die
28:26 having never worried about any of this
28:29 stuff when you start a private sector
28:32 business you will find that it operates
28:37 entirely different almost a complete
28:39 antithesis principle of a government
28:41 business which is why government health
28:43 care doesn't work and government
28:45 regulations and government bureaucracy
28:49 never works because in government you
28:51 simply get paid for existing and doing a
28:55 bare minimum job and in that kit in some
28:56 cases not even showing up to work and
28:58 this goes for state funded colleges
29:00 state funded everything now can you get
29:04 fired in these institutions yes but it's
29:06 really tough our President of the United
29:09 States Donald
29:10 Trump had to pass an executive order
29:13 allowing government agencies to fire
29:16 people because of incompetency because
29:18 incompetency was not the grounds for
29:20 firing people
29:23 un-fuckin'-believable men but he's
29:26 happened to clean up this mess and take
29:27 a bunch of [ __ ] at the same time but in
29:30 the private sector what happens when you
29:32 don't perform you get fired maybe you
29:34 get warned if their employer is pretty
29:37 cool and they're like well you know I
29:39 can see it in you we could just little
29:41 misdirected misguided and unfocused let
29:43 me get you focused right is that better
29:44 it's just better said butters this
29:46 better right boom get a second chance
29:48 the ever in that situation take
29:51 advantage of the second chance please
29:52 nobody wants to fire anybody you don't
29:55 want to ever tell anybody that they're
29:56 fired and two you don't have to right in
29:58 the middle of crossing a river find
30:00 another horse to jump on to right but if
30:03 a Senate hearing was transformed into a
30:06 conference room meeting at a private
30:09 sector company so this became a
30:12 conference meeting in a company and we
30:16 started bringing out all the issues that
30:17 are broken within our company and
30:21 someone has really committed egregious
30:24 acts against the company embezzled money
30:27 stole property failed to do their job
30:32 you know that in the private sector that
30:35 person gets reprimanded or fired and
30:39 potentially if they broke the law
30:41 there's criminal proceedings there's
30:44 action because in a private sector world
30:47 where reality [ __ ] matters a company
30:51 has to survive it has to defend itself
30:56 when you see a nation looking the other
30:59 way constantly for all these egregious
31:02 crimes some of which you know I mean a
31:05 guy being a pedophile on the side in
31:07 England you know that is a personal
31:10 issue that needs to be dealt with
31:11 because it's a it's the worst crime in
31:13 the world and then on the you know the
31:16 government side when people are doing a
31:19 pay-for-play situation where every
31:20 single senator has a foundation if any
31:23 center
31:24 in America congressman House
31:27 representative anyone has a foundation
31:29 that is the bribery mechanism for them
31:35 to take money on the side but the
31:38 biggest thing is that people don't
31:42 understand government and they love it
31:45 that way
31:46 committee structures you know law in
31:49 general is pretty pretty mysterious to
31:54 people right but this law have to be so
31:58 mysterious
31:59 does it really now how many times in
32:02 America have you seen the shows where
32:04 you have like Judge Judy or the People's
32:09 Court used to be called up initially
32:11 it's small claims court the way the show
32:15 really works is that you go in and you
32:17 sign over all of your rights to a
32:18 Hollywood stage and you're willing to
32:21 accept the verdict of the judge who's a
32:24 real judge but you'll find out really
32:26 quick that people think that there are
32:28 laws that don't exist I am going in for
32:32 money and rewards for damages on
32:34 something that is not prosecutable
32:36 because we haven't developed laws around
32:37 certain things that do hurt people but
32:41 small claims is very interesting because
32:42 it's sort of an interpretation of the
32:45 law at that moment when someone says why
32:47 loan this person $500 they said they pay
32:49 me back I barely had the 500 to loan
32:53 them that my cousin there my brother
32:55 there my girlfriend my boyfriend and
32:57 they ran off with the cash so I'm just
32:59 trying to get a payment plan worked out
33:00 or something I need a judgment and the
33:04 judge can say well you know you really
33:06 didn't follow any protocol you have a
33:07 contract no it's kind of a handshake yep
33:11 mm-hmm all right well you really don't
33:14 have what you need legally but I'm gonna
33:17 go ahead inside with you and you owe
33:19 this person 500 bucks the law obviously
33:23 exists for very specific reason
33:25 attorneys because if we all went into
33:28 court and just said I don't like this
33:31 person I think this is a crime and you
33:33 constantly have to say that's not a
33:35 crime you know colluding with the
33:37 Russians
33:38 colluding in general isn't a crime until
33:40 you actually break the law I don't even
33:43 know you know is it illegal to sit in
33:45 some back poker room and plot to rob a
33:49 bank but you never actually buy a gun
33:53 you never you never take any action on
33:55 your plan it's just a bunch of pieces of
33:57 paper on the table is that a crime I
34:00 don't know seems like it would be but
34:04 maybe it's not right but now we have the
34:07 internet right we have the Internet
34:10 where we have knowledge databases where
34:11 you put in what you're looking for I own
34:13 a Windows 10 machine and I can't get
34:15 audio to work go I had a bunch of things
34:18 pop up and none of them actually help
34:20 you probably but at least there's some
34:23 sort of system but the amount of times
34:27 I've talked to my attorney buddies and
34:29 said oh I got a friend of mine and this
34:31 is the circumstance that that and they
34:32 just go oh yeah it's totally illegal and
34:34 there's a bunch of cases like that or
34:36 that's nothing that's [ __ ] suck it
34:38 up go away it seems like because they
34:42 can answer these questions swiftly and
34:46 we've got medical databases online where
34:48 people go hey I got a rash my heart's
34:50 palpitating my hair is turning red in
34:51 Woonsocket they they'll come back to you
34:55 and say okay well it could be many
34:56 things and don't take this as you know a
34:58 medical recommendation of any kind but
35:00 at least when you go and see your
35:01 physician you have a little bit more
35:03 idea of what could be wrong with you
35:06 good there's talk shows right where
35:12 lawyers have shows and you call and you
35:16 pitch things and they tell you what you
35:17 can and can't do and I'll tell you what
35:19 KFI radio it's kind of a conservative
35:21 radio station here in Orange County
35:22 California area probably Los Angeles but
35:26 it
35:27 I forgot the guy's name but I will I
35:31 tell you I want to say nine times out of
35:33 ten it's not a crime what these people
35:35 are calling up for they're just angry
35:37 and they want revenge we've all been
35:40 there right
35:41 why go down that little rabbit hole
35:45 because if we're to actually demand
35:47 something of our of our representatives
35:49 and they're to listen to their
35:51 constituents
35:52 there's a barrier of knowledge between
35:54 us obviously someone who's been on the
35:57 hill for five years probably even two
35:59 years is well-acquainted with the
36:01 labyrinth that is the hill in at least
36:03 the United States of America I'm sure
36:04 your respective countries are as complex
36:08 they know that when they talk to their
36:10 constituents at some rally and listen
36:12 talking to an attorney or a former
36:14 senator or a former politician the idea
36:17 that they are going to be able to have a
36:19 productive conversation between the two
36:20 of them is very tough they don't speak
36:24 the same language your humble narrator
36:27 right here has no clue
36:30 all those committee structures in this
36:34 in the capitol building I have no clue
36:36 how that works I mean I maybe I have a
36:38 clue of generally how crazy and complex
36:41 it is but I am at less than a percent
36:45 probably of a hundred percent of
36:46 knowledge of how all that works how even
36:48 a Senate hearing occurs what happens
36:51 afterwards but I can tell you just from
36:54 my layman's view of this these people
36:57 walk away scot-free constantly James
36:59 Comey is a free man is unbelievable the
37:03 guy and well the other thing to these
37:05 you need to know that I've heard
37:06 recently and you guys can correct me if
37:08 I'm wrong but I was in Australia
37:11 recently and I read an article from
37:14 their perspective of our situation with
37:16 all of this corruption the FBI and they
37:19 said that these people are taking plea
37:21 deals to get out of the crimes that they
37:24 committed and most foreign countries of
37:29 the first world nature do not have plea
37:30 deals because it allows you to walk away
37:33 from your crime and there's no and I
37:35 guess foreign countries European maybe
37:37 even Australia that the article was
37:39 definitely claiming Australia does this
37:41 they they said we don't do that you got
37:47 to pay the crime pay the price for the
37:48 crime
37:49 what a novel idea there's a famous
37:53 goddamn case and you need to look this
37:55 up the Podesta brothers who did the same
37:59 crime that Bannon did but they did it 10
38:01 years longer and made probably ten times
38:03 the amount of money
38:06 they got their record expunged and
38:10 immuno fide because they were allowed to
38:14 finger one of their own employees in
38:16 their corrupt company and take a plea
38:20 deal of immunity for their own crimes of
38:22 their own company's very foundation and
38:25 if that doesn't make any sense to you
38:26 let me give you another analogy you're a
38:29 big drug cartel dealer in Colombia you
38:32 sell metric tons of cocaine now I don't
38:35 know if it's illegal down there to do
38:36 that but seems like they have a war on
38:39 drugs haha but it would be tantamount to
38:43 them turning in a little petty dealer
38:46 perhaps in America that guy goes to jail
38:50 they take a plea deal and they're no
38:53 longer ever because the double jeopardy
38:55 in America we're not allowed to be
38:57 charged for the same crime twice you can
38:59 never be brought up on charges for your
39:01 original crime wow that's like raping a
39:04 bunch of kids and you turn in some
39:06 little petty guy in your neighborhood
39:09 for looking at maybe pictures of it
39:11 that's still horrible that guy goes to
39:14 jail and you're completely immune affine
39:16 from all of the actual child rape that
39:18 you did that's why plea deals are a
39:20 bunch of [ __ ] plea deals were there
39:25 portrayed on television as this sort of
39:28 noble thing that a crime a criminal will
39:30 do when they flip but in the end and in
39:33 fact if you watch the the lockup shows
39:35 on Netflix plea deals are like 50% of
39:39 the settlements right they plead guilty
39:43 and they get a reduced sentence but in
39:48 the when you get up high enough inside
39:50 of our government you get you kid away
39:52 scot-free you get full immunity right
39:55 you don't get any charges of any kind or
39:58 maybe you do but there's no time maybe
40:00 there's a bunch of probation when you're
40:03 a millionaire and you get probation that
40:05 basically means nothing analogy you
40:10 could think of would be a brick wall the
40:14 bricks would be
40:17 justice and the way of your country and
40:21 we I'd say the American Way in my
40:23 country but the mortar would be the
40:27 action that needs to take place the
40:30 fabric that sews it all together to make
40:33 it have a strength to it
40:35 right they go take a brick house and
40:38 remove all the mortar and a flash some
40:40 you know Harry Potter spell and what's
40:43 gonna happen to the house it's gonna
40:44 fall down well the walls of justice when
40:48 you move up high enough and you get into
40:50 these faux categories of Justice as
40:53 mentioned in the beginning of this
40:55 episode you don't have justice you've
40:58 got an apparition of Justice Society for
41:03 so many decades has been allowed to sit
41:04 on in their hands right and honestly
41:08 that should be possible if you put
41:09 something together it should just work a
41:15 system unfortunately the criminals are
41:19 always awake always being devious and
41:22 always conniving and there's probably
41:27 two different intents one is to be super
41:29 lazy you know after you get the criminal
41:31 machine going you take advantage of all
41:33 the loopholes it becomes a machine for
41:37 them to make money which gives them
41:38 power the other one is you have devious
41:42 people that simply want to watch the
41:44 world burn they need adrenaline one of
41:48 the situations you have to be made aware
41:49 of is once a rich man finds out he can't
41:54 buy heaven he brings hell to earth he
41:59 brings hell to earth I'll say it again
42:03 twice once a rich man can't buy heaven
42:05 he brings hell to earth that's the
42:09 mantra of a sociopath they let's just
42:15 say you got completely wealthy beyond
42:17 your wildest dreams you have an
42:19 inexhaustible bank account but you're
42:22 not married yet maybe you're kind of a
42:25 weird person maybe you're an [ __ ]
42:26 you look strange whatever
42:31 and that angers you you're like man I
42:33 was told if I had a ton of money
42:35 happiness was around the corner wouldn't
42:39 have to work anymore I could travel the
42:40 world I could pay people to sleep with
42:43 me or whatever
42:44 you drive all the fancy cars but in the
42:48 end that all wore off really really fast
42:50 it's that Twilight Zone where the bank
42:52 robber goes to what he thinks is heaven
42:54 and he gets everything he ever wanted
42:56 women money gets to go to casinos who
43:00 lives in a mansion and eventually he
43:02 realizes he's in Hell right so the key
43:06 problem with socialism as most of you
43:08 know is that there's always that layer
43:11 of rich man who is trying to make the
43:14 world burn and they have power and they
43:19 have money and they can influence people
43:20 right the problem that we have in our
43:24 world is that we believe that there's
43:26 special people that run countries
43:28 special people that run your
43:29 neighborhood and they are there are
43:31 special people that have that chieftain
43:33 gene I think it's recessed in every
43:36 single human being I don't think the
43:40 government jobs look appealing to anyone
43:43 because of the the bureaucracy and the
43:45 [ __ ] and the crime that goes on no
43:47 one wants to come out of a life where
43:49 they're living sort of a very rewarding
43:52 I chose this for myself life to go into
43:55 government service and deal with all the
43:58 10-year senators that owned the place
44:02 right in America we call them the super
44:05 PACs right
44:05 you have Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer
44:08 and all the [ __ ] heads they own the
44:11 place they've been there for 30 years
44:13 you try to walk in and get anything done
44:16 they're like oh you're not going to get
44:17 anything cuz you need a committee to get
44:19 that to happen and we have to approve
44:20 your committee into existence and
44:22 therefore it's never going to happen or
44:24 you can have your little committee but
44:25 nothing's ever going to happen because
44:26 we're never going to allow you to draft
44:28 your law or you draft your law we're
44:30 never going to vote on it or we're gonna
44:32 vote it down because it messes with the
44:34 global agenda of what we're trying to do
44:35 or mine goes first then yours goes
44:38 second and mine's gonna take 20 years to
44:39 get through so you know if
44:41 still alive when yours is ready to go
44:43 good luck it's like tax code it's too
44:47 complex for the average human being to
44:49 understand it's like law it's too
44:51 complex for the average person to
44:52 understand but you were supposed to
44:54 follow all the rules for your taxes and
44:55 you're supposed to follow every letter
44:57 of the law of which you don't know
44:59 exists now thank God most of us don't
45:03 travel in circles were the laws that we
45:05 would accidentally break or available to
45:08 us much right the world is a wonderful
45:12 place outside of all these paradigms I
45:16 want you to remember it's a wonderful
45:19 place I mentioned this a long time ago I
45:23 think in season two but maybe once in
45:25 season three there's a there's a video
45:28 game called fallout it's a
45:30 post-apocalyptic world it's it in its
45:33 literal form as a hideous place to be as
45:36 post-apocalyptic they had a nuclear war
45:39 in the 50s or at least it's kind of
45:42 frozen in that sort of nuclear era the
45:46 world was decimated a bunch of citizens
45:50 went and lived in vaults at a bunch of
45:52 citizens were outside because they
45:53 didn't buy the policy to live inside
45:54 vaults so the people outside mutated
45:57 into ghouls which looked like zombies
45:58 but they can still talk if they sit too
46:00 long in that farm they turn into zombie
46:02 zombies but there's humans that survived
46:05 there's big mutant humans but there's an
46:09 appeal to the game the players of the
46:11 game if at least if you're a male I
46:13 don't know about females I've never met
46:14 a female that's played the game that
46:17 you're a nomadic person you will have
46:19 lost everything right you won't have a
46:21 wife you want to have a child most in
46:23 most cases so there there are those
46:24 characters in the game but it's not you
46:27 fallout 4 you lose your wife and you're
46:29 chasing your unborn are you sure your
46:31 newborn child that was abducted but
46:34 there's an allure to the world because
46:36 all of the taxes are gone all the
46:38 government's gone I think that's why
46:40 there's an appeal to shows like Walking
46:42 Dead as much as you are dealing with
46:44 herds of zombies that will eventually
46:46 get you you don't have the pressures of
46:51 society on you you can go wherever the
46:54 hell you can go
46:55 and fallout it's very much like that you
46:57 can go and live in a little weird town
47:00 and just sort of hunker down build up
47:03 your defenses and hope that you don't
47:04 get killed and as much as that's
47:07 horrific there's an allure to the world
47:10 because at least it's fair you know the
47:15 circumstances you know the variables of
47:18 your life I can get killed by this this
47:21 this Ennis every human being that I'm
47:23 with can unless you're in Diamond City
47:29 can rob me
47:30 I guess the institution is the best
47:32 place to live in that game we've allowed
47:35 our world to get out of control and
47:38 we've allowed it to get out of control
47:40 to the point where there is a layer of
47:43 people that we have ordained as more
47:47 powerful than us at almost a celestial
47:50 level the fact that there are royal
47:54 families on this planet that actually
47:55 have laws that people obey that say that
47:59 you can commit a crime but no one can
48:01 press a charge against you because
48:02 you're of the Royal descent is one of
48:06 the most astronomically insane things
48:08 that we've ever done on this planet well
48:10 they're just immune from everything okay
48:14 well they're the rich man that wants to
48:16 see the world burn because they've had
48:20 it all they've had it all forever
48:25 nothing entertains them I mean ask the
48:28 Queen you know you go up to her and I
48:31 say you make real good friends with her
48:33 some weird you know side relationship
48:36 you end up forming somehow and you're
48:38 like you want to go to Japan you want to
48:40 go to Rome you want to go to America and
48:44 she's gonna look at you and go no why
48:47 why don't you want to go well I've
48:49 already been there I've already been to
48:51 all those countries 10 20 30 times and
48:54 I'm very content with where I live I
48:56 like my palace I like to keep things
48:58 comfortable I've seen all that the
49:02 allure of all that's gone you know to
49:03 the wayside
49:06 hmm what do you want to go buy a really
49:09 fancy car and race it real fast
49:11 somewhere in the countryside
49:12 maybe we can commandeer an airport erase
49:15 Lamborghinis up-and-down
49:16 nope nothing matters you want to eat the
49:20 fanciest meal in the world nope
49:22 want to go buy some fancy clothes nope
49:25 what is left to entertain these people
49:27 besides control I want to run the world
49:30 I want to look at my Stratego table top
49:35 with all little pieces which are all the
49:38 people in the world and I want to
49:40 control that where is it Prince Philip
49:42 wrote the book in the 90s his memoirs I
49:45 believe is like 91 or something like
49:47 that in his book he said if I ever came
49:49 back was reincarnated I come back as the
49:52 virus to kill all of humanity that's a
49:56 little weird don't you think how do you
49:57 think he got there kill all of humanity
50:01 really you don't didn't say kill all
50:04 everyone but white people
50:06 he said everybody his own kind he killed
50:09 his wife
50:09 he kills kids not amazing we don't think
50:15 like they think which is why they can
50:18 rationalize things like we're gonna let
50:22 everyone off through some faux hearing
50:26 I'm beating this up from a lot of
50:28 different angles not to just fill up
50:30 time but to get you to think to get you
50:36 to see doors that don't that you hadn't
50:39 previously seen they've been they've
50:41 been there the whole time
50:42 doors to alternatives but the first
50:45 thing we have to do is spread the word
50:47 spread the word that this is something
50:49 that is unjust it is there to say sheet
50:53 us technically speaking the only law
50:56 that's being broken by doing these faux
50:58 hearings and all this faux hatred
51:01 towards people breaking the law is that
51:03 they don't press charges you know that
51:07 you don't talk about you know is it
51:10 against the law to know that someone is
51:12 a criminal
51:12 you've seen them red handedly do
51:14 something and you don't press charges on
51:17 them well
51:19 us peasants sheep and cattle
51:24 it's aiding and abetting perhaps after
51:28 the fact your spouse comes home and says
51:31 honey I just robbed a bank I've got a
51:33 million dollars let's go live high on
51:35 the hog or I'm gonna put it away for a
51:37 rainy day or I'll save it for all of our
51:38 kids and Trust Funds or whatever I'm
51:40 donating it but there was a crime there
51:43 and you don't say anything you know that
51:45 if they ever find out that he did that
51:46 crime they're coming right at you to say
51:49 did you know did you know he robbed that
51:51 Bank well I did but you know he was my
51:55 husband he was my best bud so I didn't
51:58 say anything okay we'll turn around put
52:00 your hands on your head put your hands
52:03 behind your back you're going to jail -
52:05 you may not serve the full extent of
52:07 their sentence but you're gonna get it
52:08 probably a 2/3 sentence they get 20
52:11 years you're getting 10 I had a friend
52:14 of mine who dated a girl she was in the
52:18 back of a car in Las Vegas I think when
52:20 they robbed a bank her friends went in
52:22 the guys went in and robbed a bank and
52:25 she sit in the back seat according to
52:26 her and she got nine years they got 31
52:30 guy got 20 she served nine and a half
52:34 years in prison but just sit in the back
52:36 of a car well I would say that all the
52:40 people who know that these individuals
52:41 have broken the law who bring them into
52:43 a Senate hearing and don't put them
52:45 under oath
52:46 I had these ridiculous conversations
52:47 with them when they're well aware
52:49 because they're part of intelligence
52:51 committees that have been that have been
52:53 shown the actual red-handed proof of the
52:56 crime they're aiding and abetting
53:00 perhaps the first thing that we do is we
53:02 pass some some new laws and statutes
53:04 that say if you know of a crime in
53:07 government and you look the other way
53:10 you're gonna get double triple the
53:14 sentence of those who committed it
53:16 underneath you or beside you or above
53:18 you wouldn't that change the day one of
53:22 the things I always tell my employees
53:23 when I have them is please do not cover
53:27 up for a bad employee and that does not
53:30 mean that someone's had a really bad
53:33 event in life and they're unable to do
53:34 their job and we don't all pitch in to
53:36 help out right that's not what I'm
53:38 saying
53:38 someone who's been paid to do a
53:40 particular job and for whatever reason
53:42 they're just lazy and it'll happen where
53:46 employees will complain about an
53:48 employee but they continually do their
53:50 work the problem that that creates for
53:53 upper management is it as a CEO I can't
53:57 figure out who the hell is doing their
53:59 job and I can't figure out how bad the
54:02 person who needs to be fired is failing
54:05 so when I try to contemplate a
54:06 termination or a warning I don't really
54:09 have all the data obviously one can sit
54:13 down and have extensive conversations
54:14 but here I am now having to do an
54:16 investigative procedure within my own
54:18 company to figure out ok what were they
54:21 assigned I you know like there are two
54:23 layers below me so I got to figure out
54:25 what the manager and sign them how well
54:27 do they attempt to execute their job did
54:29 they get any percentage of it done
54:31 did we not train them properly like you
54:33 go through all those logistics but if no
54:37 one covers for someone else I mean
54:40 obviously within reason okay there's
54:42 teamwork of course but if someone is
54:45 just blatantly not doing their job then
54:48 we can blatantly see they're not doing
54:50 their job and it comes up short and we
54:52 go what's up you were assigned this why
54:55 didn't you get this done and maybe they
54:57 have a good reason maybe they don't they
54:59 were like hey man my wife just divorced
55:01 me last night and she's going to take
55:04 all the kids or whatever my husband
55:05 cheated on me or whatever and it's
55:07 really wracking my whole soul and I
55:09 can't I can't concentrate and then we
55:11 all kind of give them a hug and say okay
55:13 we're all gonna chip in for you at least
55:16 we know now right and you know people
55:19 won't always come forth with that
55:20 information they'll try to function
55:22 underneath or above certain things that
55:24 are eating their soul it's very
55:28 important process in government we have
55:32 people colluding breaking the law or
55:37 colluding to break the most valuable
55:40 laws that we have in our respective
55:42 countries right the big transformation
55:44 that's going on is too
55:46 in the world right now the Great
55:48 Awakening is two things first phase is
55:51 becoming aware of all the crimes that
55:53 are being committed and by who and what
55:55 the huge spider web of people committing
55:59 these crimes are like where all the
56:02 nodes you know every time a spider web
56:03 let's just use that as an analogy
56:06 crosses over another wire that's a
56:09 little node where if you spray it with
56:11 waters a little bead of water right
56:12 there right but the cross hatches that's
56:14 just the connection between two people
56:16 that are committing the crime so we have
56:18 to understand all the participants and
56:20 how they're involved we probably have
56:23 some good people in government that have
56:25 been forced by a deep state to
56:26 participate in crimes at the threat of
56:28 their own safety there may be some
56:31 immunity there but the second thing
56:34 that's happening the Great Awakening and
56:35 it's the slowest part of the
56:37 transformation it's figuring out where
56:40 we can take action to fix things that is
56:45 a two layer process first layer is what
56:48 I'm doing in this episode which is
56:49 making you aware of a shitty process
56:52 that gets criminals off right and that's
56:55 a double entendre if there ever was one
56:57 they don't pay any price for their
57:00 crimes and they are elated that [ __ ]
57:03 smirk on stalks face that smirk on James
57:06 commis face that's because they're
57:09 sitting there going you [ __ ] can't
57:11 touch me the previous administration
57:14 just a unified me from all my crimes you
57:18 can't touch me unless you find a new
57:19 crime and boy I've made sure you can't
57:22 find those crimes one of the things
57:25 before I shut up here that saddens my
57:29 soul is every time I hear someone say
57:31 write your senator write your senator
57:34 and tell them that you want justice
57:37 really you think they give a [ __ ] what
57:42 you think
57:42 you think they even read that letter the
57:46 only times I've ever seen that work is
57:47 when people stand outside police
57:50 precincts protesting someone innocent
57:52 that's been captured and put in jail
57:54 because they happen to go against the
57:56 state they'll do it they send a message
58:00 to the person
58:00 in the prison cell we can get to you man
58:03 you better shut up even if we let you go
58:05 because all these protesters out front
58:07 you know you're watched you know that
58:10 we're in control and like they said in
58:12 Blade Runner your little people Q has
58:15 said something over and over that we the
58:19 people run this country we run this
58:21 world actually he means the world we're
58:25 all Patriots nobody wants to wake up
58:29 with a threat next door whether it be
58:31 your neighbor or the country next-door
58:33 or someone around the other side of the
58:34 world with the nuke on the back of a
58:36 missile we're not going to get that
58:38 peace until we take action we have to
58:41 know how to take action we don't want
58:44 our world run by small claims courts
58:46 right where you walk in you don't know
58:48 what the hell you're doing you plead
58:49 with the judge to find the crime and to
58:53 you know be victorious in judgment we
58:57 have to know the process for those of
58:59 you who know attorneys I'm now starting
59:01 to reach out to all my attorney friends
59:02 and then the information coming back is
59:06 profound to my life we're all say well
59:09 is this a crime and they'll go nope
59:11 that's [ __ ] it's not a crime well
59:13 then why is it on the mass media because
59:15 it's all [ __ ] am i gay okay well
59:18 where can we get these people well this
59:20 this this and this and this and so I'm
59:21 like [ __ ] okay
59:23 so now I know kind of what the
59:24 procedures are I've got one of my
59:26 buddies that's high enough up there he
59:29 knows all forms of law he is explained
59:33 to me the layers within government that
59:35 these people hide under and how it works
59:39 Hugh's been very helpful in helping us
59:41 understand how the immunity has been
59:43 given away by candy we have the power we
59:48 really do we need to educate those who
59:53 are ordained in this world with the with
59:57 handcuffs that's a problem probably
60:00 easiest way to say it
60:02 those in military those in police those
60:05 in government who are new and fresh and
60:07 idealistic those in local law those in
60:10 state law those in federal law if you
60:13 know these people
60:14 if you lay in bed with these people at
60:16 night and somehow you get this message
60:21 then you are great influencer to those
60:25 people
60:25 why were they really worried about
60:27 Monica Lewinsky in the White House
60:29 passing out [ __ ] right why were they
60:32 worried about that because I was
60:34 definitely a Clinton supporter in the
60:36 90s I was totally asleep than the only
60:38 thing about all of us are conceding [ __ ]
60:40 and but someone told me they said you
60:43 have to give a [ __ ] about this and I
60:46 said why he goes because those [ __ ]
60:49 are more powerful than you could
60:50 possibly imagine if she were to be she
60:54 wasn't but if she were to be a double
60:56 agent for instance and you know maybe
60:59 she's just a country girl who's swooned
61:04 by his charm then no big deal she's just
61:08 a person with amazingly low self-esteem
61:10 right but if she were to be approached
61:14 by a foreign nation some lobbyist and
61:17 say look here you have a relationship
61:20 with Clinton you don't have to answer
61:22 that question but we hear that that's
61:24 what's going on well we will put a
61:28 million dollars every quarter into a
61:30 bank account in Switzerland in your name
61:33 if you will simply nudge him in
61:37 conversation nudge him before a blow job
61:40 that you sure would like it if this
61:43 would happen you sure would like it if
61:47 that would happen and he has to agree to
61:50 it before he gets the next BJ and then
61:54 results have to happen before you
61:56 continue to give him BJ's and he gets
61:59 off on the idea that he has power and he
62:02 can actually do it he doesn't even care
62:03 about the agenda it just becomes a
62:05 little game to get a [ __ ] and that
62:08 changed my whole perspective on the
62:10 whole thing when you serve government
62:12 everything should be transparent as
62:15 possible how do you handle matters of
62:17 national security I don't know I think
62:20 that in this last year and a half we've
62:22 had a lot of those agendas of our
62:24 country exposed in
62:26 and tweets by Donald Trump he's flat-out
62:30 saying you do that you're gonna suffer
62:33 but if you do this we're gonna be
62:35 friends let's be friends and he's
62:39 putting it out there now exactly what
62:42 would take place to make a threat real
62:44 like bombing you know a country or
62:46 something no we're not gonna know what
62:48 the military's planning right they're
62:50 not gonna tell us okay we've got this
62:51 site that site this site we're gonna go
62:53 in this stage first pincer that up a ba
62:55 have a phalanx right they won't tell us
62:59 I don't think we need to know exactly
63:02 how that would go down but at least we
63:03 would have a transparent relationship
63:05 with all the other countries of the
63:07 world so we know all right I thought we
63:10 were in a huge battle with Mexico
63:11 recently that this wall was gonna
63:14 frustrate the [ __ ] out of everybody sent
63:17 a wrong message to Mexico and the trade
63:20 agreement explode we might have like
63:21 this little war on the border something
63:23 like that well he made a phone call
63:24 yesterday in front of the press and he's
63:26 cranked out a new trade deal the
63:28 President of Mexico seems to be pretty
63:30 satisfied did you get everything he won
63:31 probably not did we get everything we
63:33 wanted probably not but it was
63:35 transparent to a degree of course
63:36 they're rehearsed speeches on both sides
63:38 of the phone call but when's the last
63:41 time you ever solved that in the public
63:44 eye right someone just came out and
63:47 showed us what's gonna happen all right
63:50 I slept a little better last night
63:51 knowing that we've kind of subdued that
63:53 and after being destroyed right as Ross
63:56 Perot said back in the 90s if nasty
63:58 getting after gets past you're gonna
63:59 hear a big sucking sound of the United
64:01 States and it's exactly what took place
64:05 no sucking sound is going the opposite
64:09 direction it's pulling everything back
64:11 into the United States and we're
64:13 eventually going to get over all these
64:14 trade deals they're calling it trade
64:16 wars that really aren't they're
64:18 negotiations and they're negotiations
64:20 over tens of hundreds of billions of
64:22 dollars of course there's gonna be
64:24 tension really if you got you know if
64:27 you retired it's a thirty years old with
64:30 a million dollars coming in a year from
64:32 some weird agency and I come by later on
64:36 and say you know what that's not fair to
64:38 everyone else
64:39 who's paying that billion dollars they
64:41 don't really want to give you that money
64:42 and you don't really need it you're
64:44 gonna fight to keep it and eventually
64:47 gonna go through the full kubler-ross
64:48 effect and you're gonna you're gonna
64:51 accept it at the end I know you feel me
64:54 now let's spread the word let's add more
64:58 DNA to this I just put up a skeleton
65:00 please please please the comments have
65:03 been a little light on the subject
65:04 matter that I'm talking about one of you
65:07 made a comment that some of the episodes
65:09 in season four has really been for I've
65:11 been a little scatterbrained a little
65:13 little abstract I do apologize sometimes
65:16 I go into subjects that are tough to to
65:20 wrangle down into a charter right I'd
65:22 have to spend an enormous amount of time
65:23 probably creating an agenda scripting
65:26 all my words blah blah blah the whole
65:29 beauty of the show in my opinion is it's
65:31 a free-form conversation right solutions
65:35 that's what we need
65:36 methodology that's what we need if
65:39 you're an attorney please weigh in
65:42 either how crazy I am idealistic I am or
65:46 if you see some legitimacy to this this
65:50 entire theme of this episode please
65:52 comment if you're not an attorney but
65:54 you're married to one you know one pass
65:57 the link to them and say look this guy's
65:59 kind of weird he's in black and white
66:00 but listen to this episode and let me
66:02 know what the hell we can do or you know
66:06 they never watch the show because
66:08 they're not youtubers or whatever
66:10 podcasters and you simply explain it to
66:14 them then bring the information to us so
66:16 the we can here you know some we can
66:19 engage in a group discussion about this
66:21 it's SuperDuper important we have to end
66:25 these plea deals that get everyone
66:27 scot-free for horrible crimes
66:30 I can't watch shows like The Daily Show
66:33 anymore when I was asleep I was totally
66:37 addicted to those shows I can't listen
66:40 to talk radio anymore because all I do
66:43 is sit and complain and nothing ever
66:45 happens hit peace books yeah
66:51 sometimes you have interesting facts
66:53 usually the cliffnotes the most and most
66:55 I want to get involved with it they say
66:59 that you know well I can definitely tell
67:00 you I recently engaged in a trade show
67:05 in Australia and I had to participate in
67:09 the construction of the booth because
67:12 you just do you know you're all of us
67:13 are there we're just helping out and
67:16 taking you down after it was done and it
67:20 was one of these things one of my
67:22 buddies said you know this is I like
67:25 this kind of labor because it really
67:27 gives me a sense of a job well done at
67:29 the end of the day he's a Salesman and
67:32 so his whole thing is he has to nurture
67:33 sales for months and months and months
67:35 and he doesn't get a closure you know
67:36 sometimes that don't sales don't go
67:38 through and other times they do but it
67:39 takes months when I used to make video
67:41 games Jesus I mean it would take up to
67:43 two years to make a game the last game I
67:45 made from my own company took five years
67:48 and just begging and borrowing money to
67:52 get it all funded right and then it did
67:55 well for about a year and then it kind
67:57 of fell off because everybody got tired
67:59 the changes we need to make to make the
68:01 game super addictive at the end
68:02 everybody was like I don't have any more
68:04 time I don't any more money I can't do
68:06 this anymore
68:06 getting justice to go all the way
68:09 through is a job well done
68:11 it's correcting our society and
68:13 preventing these these these crimes for
68:16 continuing this idea that you're too big
68:20 to go down has got to go down too big to
68:23 fail' corporations that are subsidized
68:26 by our country yeah there is some logic
68:28 to that in some cases right
68:30 if the [ __ ] if the company hasn't
68:33 engaged in crimes or neglect of their
68:37 own product and they're trying as hard
68:40 as they possibly can to be successful
68:42 and it's important to our country as a
68:45 strategic product that we want to sell
68:46 to and reinforce our gross national
68:49 product or gross domestic product then
68:51 we should consider okay my taxes are
68:54 going to go through some subsidizing
68:57 program to help Ford Motor Company or
68:59 something like that right but there's
69:03 stipulations on the money
69:04 make a goddamn good car would you stop
69:07 building everything to fall apart would
69:09 you right we have an opportunity coming
69:12 up to restructure at least the United
69:15 States of America in the short term but
69:17 every other country in the planet in the
69:19 long term and the the needs to change
69:23 are becoming very apparent in the EU
69:28 countries in the UK and Australia
69:33 I'd say Asia is pretty much succeeding
69:36 in everything that they're trying to do
69:37 all their strategies are working ok it's
69:43 there's no crime in that they're their
69:46 own sovereign being as long as we allow
69:48 them to do what they do they're not
69:49 breaking the law but if we can get
69:52 justice served and get rid of the swamp
69:54 through criminal prosecution there's
69:58 nothing else forbidding them from taking
70:00 office again forgetting that forbidding
70:02 them to act as a lobbyist again
70:06 forbidding them from being involved with
70:08 a particular industry you know if you
70:11 ran in Ron at the top you should never
70:14 be able to participate in any sort of
70:15 corporation of like mind because you're
70:18 a criminal if you don't go to jail to
70:20 begin with if you're a person that does
70:24 what you're told and you're you don't
70:26 have any moral base to evaluate what
70:28 you're told
70:29 then you'll do anything you'll help the
70:32 world burn
70:33 you'll pass out the torches right anyway
70:36 that's that subject if you have been to
70:40 deep thoughts radio Calm please go the
70:42 episodes are gonna start to flood out
70:44 again I want to thank you guys for
70:47 hanging on during these sort of big
70:49 pauses here lots of subjects to talk
70:53 about I've actually got to go through

71:00 together some really great episodes for
71:02 me
71:02 SuperDuper appreciate that keep those
71:04 suggestions coming if I don't do a total
71:08 episode dedicated to your idea will most
71:10 likely occur is that I will embed your
71:12 idea in a digression or some related
71:15 tough subject matter so keep listening
71:17 keep watching up
71:18 it's because your idea will most likely
71:20 surface and I'll try to give credit
71:21 where I can I do apologize for not
71:24 naming your names because I'll see it
