00:33 gentleman dDOT's
00:36 today's episode as you can see is going
00:39 to be about microchipping human beings
00:41 or chipping human beings now if you
00:44 hadn't seen my episode on transhumanism
00:46 and you're interested in the subject I
00:49 would recommend that episode as well
00:51 when I think about the subject I can't
00:55 help but recall the interview that Alex
00:59 Jones did with Aaron Russo at a hospital
01:02 where he was suffering from intestinal
01:05 cancer stomach cancer some sign some
01:08 sort he was on his way out
01:13 you can only assume he was murdered
01:16 because that's how they roll that air
01:19 Rizzo was recalling a conversation yet
01:21 had 20-plus years before if not 30 with
01:26 Nick Rockefeller who was telling him
01:30 that the end goal of the Rothschilds
01:33 and the world elite was to put a
01:38 microchip in every human being and be
01:41 able to ultimately control them track
01:44 them you name it and the funny thing is
01:48 is once we took that information because
01:50 era Brazil was obviously very very
01:52 trustworthy he had made the movie
01:55 freedom to fascism mainly focusing on
01:59 the 16th amendment passed in 1913 that
02:03 turned on illegal taxes meaning
02:06 constitutionally allele taxes and he
02:10 proved right on his documentary
02:13 stuff was illegal good even the head of
02:15 the IRS knew it's illegal it's voluntary
02:18 but once you volunteer into it you're
02:21 subject to laws that could put you into
02:22 prison if you don't do it right but he
02:25 said that there was going to be a time
02:27 when every human being was going to get
02:29 microchipped and that if he joined them
02:33 at the political level that he was being
02:34 solicited by Nick Rockefeller to run for
02:36 the Senate that his chip would have a
02:40 little km a reading in it which means
02:42 kiss my ass I want you to think of
02:45 everything you could ever be bribed with
02:48 money women sex whatever possessions and
02:54 I want you to think about someone
02:57 telling you that you could be a god on
02:59 earth through a chip preference imagine
03:03 what you know some can understand normal
03:07 thinking Pelosi would do for that chip
03:12 but we start spreading that information
03:15 and what happens people tell us we're
03:17 crazy not only are you conspiracy
03:20 theorists but now you're paranoid right
03:23 there's just that extra little
03:24 exponential kick on the end times too
03:28 but now we carry around something better
03:32 than chips we carry around cellphones
03:35 which have all kinds of chips in them
03:38 not only a chip that says who you are
03:41 it's fully trackable to every other
03:43 piece of information they have on you
03:45 and every other database on planet Earth
03:47 but it tells them where you are no
03:51 matter how you put the device down it's
03:53 filming the room it's got a speaker and
03:57 a microphone that can always be turned
04:01 on now you will hear a lot of claims
04:04 about the fact that up the phone if the
04:06 phone is off all kinds of stuff can be
04:08 invoked on the phone wall it's off I
04:11 will tell you that the phone would have
04:14 to fully power up internally to be able
04:18 to get what it's capturing out the door
04:22 to get it to a transmission a receiving
04:24 station to then broadcast it further
04:28 now if every appliance in our house is
04:31 forced to turn into an electric
04:32 appliance your water meter the electric
04:35 meter your gas meter then the amount of
04:40 power needed to jump it to the next
04:42 broadcast station might be minimal it
04:45 just depends phones are made very flimsy
04:48 why is that well one they love charging
04:54 you for the break the broken screen but
04:57 it also requires you to cage it inside a
05:02 case so that if you drop it it doesn't
05:05 break instead of just building the thing
05:08 in a case like a [ __ ] toy alright we
05:10 buy toys for children all the time that
05:12 are meant to be slobber down and beat up
05:14 and stepped on and thrown out windows
05:15 they seem to do fine we can't seem to
05:19 create an adult version of that all the
05:20 military takes everything and turns it
05:22 into one of those but the case keeps it
05:26 secure and keeps it closed which means
05:28 your likelihood of popping it out of the
05:30 case to take out a power supply somehow
05:33 get yourself up off the grid is not
05:35 likely at all so the other thing that
05:39 the chip thing actually brings out in
05:41 humanity is that there are all these
05:44 things that those of us who are awake
05:47 will find and you know we're finding it
05:49 through some other person who's actually
05:50 blowing the whistle somewhere and we
05:54 report it and of course we take all the
05:57 slings and arrows of being the messenger
06:00 on this you have to have a pretty good
06:03 Constitution to not give a [ __ ] what
06:06 anyone else thinks but then your people
06:10 around you that aren't awake who don't
06:12 want to wake up will say all the things
06:14 that they say that you're nuts and then
06:19 one of two things occurs the thing that
06:23 you're talking about vanishes because
06:25 it's so outrageous that everyone shut it
06:28 shut it down in the local level the
06:30 state level the federal level and it's
06:33 only because people woke up that this
06:37 happened
06:38 and so we succeed we get rid of it and
06:41 the people that are calling us names
06:44 benefit from the fact that we chopped it
06:46 down and then there's the second side of
06:49 it which is what we did say is going to
06:52 happen and what they said was never
06:54 going to happen and that we're crazy for
06:56 saying what happened happens and then
06:59 all of a sudden the person that was so
07:02 sure this wasn't going to occur starts
07:05 pretending like they knew it all the
07:07 time or big deal they go from calling
07:12 you a name and calling you paranoid to
07:15 saying that they were on board the
07:16 entire time and it's this latter thing
07:20 that's actually very interesting right
07:22 in the former example there was a
07:25 situation where in the United States
07:27 they were calling for essentially a
07:30 national ID and is going to cost states
07:34 millions of dollars hundreds of millions
07:36 of dollars to buy these machines create
07:39 a reactor so you create a slate place we
07:40 could go get these things and it was in
07:43 addition to your driver's license to
07:45 your Social Security card to every other
07:47 piece of information you have about your
07:48 so if you had to carry this national ID
07:50 because they were trying to turn America
07:51 into Nazi Germany where you're going to
07:54 have to actually show your papers across
07:56 state lines what was shot down because
08:00 of its expense more than anything but
08:02 now let's come back in a different form
08:04 we'll see but I shared the whole thing
08:07 with my family in the Midwest
08:10 I said well have you heard about this
08:11 thing oh no I've never heard anything I
08:12 can't imagine that I can't imagine that
08:14 and sure enough comes as the press gets
08:17 knocked down and if anything is this
08:20 most the folks that go into the
08:22 name-calling thing they obviously don't
08:24 have enough courage to come back and say
08:26 I'm sorry that was you're totally right
08:28 about that
08:29 which isn't important at all but what's
08:31 important is that they say I found the
08:35 information I totally found it it's out
08:37 there but the funny thing about
08:39 microchips is that we actually have a
08:41 very special one here it's unlike
08:44 entrails where if anyone pulls ahead of
08:46 their ass they can look up in the sky
08:48 study all the normal flights and see
08:50 these word flights and
08:51 a deduction using intelligence with chip
08:55 chipping human beings you have for the
08:57 last Jesus 15 years one experiment after
09:01 another in laboratories by institutions
09:05 by government funded institutions
09:06 privately funded institutions people
09:09 getting chips put in their body right
09:11 after 9/11 they tried to push this chip
09:14 agenda a silly family and Florida bunch
09:19 of crisis actors chipped all their pets
09:22 because they don't want to lose their
09:23 pets at 9/11 happened in Florida the
09:27 Buddy mind did a documentary episode in
09:30 the UK and around 2005 there was a
09:35 gentleman who had put a chip in his body
09:37 for the very first time in their region
09:39 it was all filmed capsule the computer
09:43 inside in Europe they've been using
09:46 chips in a way that they get the youth
09:50 into it but it's totally flopped as far
09:52 as I know it's completely flopped and
09:54 there's some physical reasons why it's
09:56 floppy but they told the kids hey you
09:59 can you like going to nightclubs yeah oh
10:01 yeah on your French welfare track oh
10:03 sure I said well if you put a chip in
10:06 your in the web of your hand right
10:08 between your thumb and your index finger
10:12 you go right to the front of the line
10:14 these clubs will agree to let you write
10:17 in so once you introduce this type of
10:21 technology you are entering the realm of
10:24 transhumanism just so you know so that's
10:29 why that other episodes actually fairly
10:30 useful there why make this episode
10:35 aren't I done I told you they're doing
10:39 it people deny it it's actually existing
10:41 they put them in there I'm going to tell
10:43 you some health risks here in a second
10:44 we're going to start studying what can
10:46 actually be done in the body the number
10:49 one reason why I want to make this
10:51 particular episode is that I need you to
10:54 understand that certain technical trends
10:58 of tyranny are going to come with the
11:02 most amazing sales pitch you've ever
11:04 heard and
11:05 you know they're going to mix probably
11:07 false flag with the cultural sales pitch
11:10 of this but they really don't need the
11:12 defaults like they can just make it the
11:13 coolest thing ever in multiple places on
11:17 the world right now there are bodies of
11:19 folks that are trying to crack this what
11:22 I remember what do I mean by crack I
11:24 mean they are trying to figure out the
11:26 cultural uptake sort of sure thing
11:29 formula for getting the next generation
11:34 to see chips as the coolest thing they
11:37 could ever have you know there's that
11:39 all those stupid toys they have
11:40 Christmastime this is going to be at
11:43 some point the toy it's going to be
11:47 cheap it's going to be subsidized by
11:48 governments you know holding a cell
11:51 phone might be demonized we're all
11:53 afraid at our level of having a single
11:56 chip inside our body the truth might be
12:00 that the time that that makes it come
12:02 out is the time when there's multiple
12:04 chips like piercings you know there's a
12:07 little chip back by your ear to play the
12:09 audio back into your drum it might be a
12:11 chip by your by your mouth to pick up
12:13 what you're saying maybe it's on the
12:14 side of your nose they're chips in your
12:17 vital signs of your body to give you
12:19 other feedback information chips inside
12:22 your eyeballs on your visual cortex to
12:24 project a augmented reality HUD right in
12:28 front of your eyesight maybe your entire
12:30 eyeball becomes synthetic I'm going to
12:33 make a prediction that if this ever
12:36 takes off and we'll have to fight a war
12:39 of some sort to ensure that it doesn't
12:43 would there be an information war or a
12:45 physical war it's going to come on like
12:50 [ __ ] day and night so let's let's
12:54 talk about some of the health risks
12:55 because some of them are already well
12:58 categorized and well collected as far as
13:01 I know every single human being has had
13:03 a microchip inserted in their body with
13:07 this newer technology again pacemakers
13:09 seem to be okay I don't know how they do
13:11 it very low voltage it's a very there's
13:16 a very confined
13:18 how should I say this charter of a
13:23 pacemaker uses virtually no voltage and
13:26 it is just sitting very little
13:28 information the second they have a chip
13:30 that's like your cell phone the amount
13:33 of information is going to be
13:34 significant and not a power it's going
13:38 to take to move that information in a
13:40 circle so going to can skate the unit is
13:42 going to be high all the research that I
13:45 bumped into says that the folks that
13:48 kept this sort of chip in their body you
13:50 know the new ones are fairly primitive
13:52 or sorry these are the very first ones
13:54 are fairly primitive some look like big
13:57 horse pills little chips inside them so
13:59 one my buddy videotaped in the UK the
14:04 ones in the palm are much much smaller
14:05 about like a tic-tac but everyone's
14:08 getting cancerous cells and infections
14:10 around these chips and it's the same
14:14 exact reason why your cell phone gives
14:17 you cancer power now again if you've
14:22 watched every single episode you're
14:23 going to go oh yeah of course we
14:24 understand because we discussed this all
14:26 the time if you have that it's very
14:27 simple electromagnetism which is the
14:33 electron cloud that goes around an atom
14:35 that gives things a conductive charge is
14:39 very dangerous and disruptive to human
14:42 DNA it acts like a sort of a circular
14:47 saw literally spherical saw that goes
14:50 through your DNA tissue your proteins
14:54 and really just can mix up everything
14:57 that's there it's the same exact reason
14:58 why you don't stay in the Sun even hours
15:01 and hours and hours every day so they
15:04 have a challenge on their hands right
15:05 now to embed these systems in your body
15:09 in a way that the additional power
15:11 supply that is not being derived from
15:13 your metabolized you know sugar calorie
15:16 conversion if that extra power supply
15:20 doesn't cause a cancerous trail in your
15:22 body well that's a big one and that's a
15:26 beautiful one for now though where did
15:28 they put the power supply itself
15:30 well with these little pill joints these
15:32 little pill jabbers they actually have a
15:34 tiny power supply inside the pill it
15:36 only goes for a certain amount of months
15:39 before it expires but there are all
15:42 kinds of other ways to power these
15:44 things which is going back to Nikola
15:48 Tesla's life where he was transmitting
15:51 power in a frequency imagine i
15:54 transmitted something at you in a big
15:56 wave of energy and it hits your little
15:59 teeny tiny chip that doesn't need much
16:01 energy in the first place and your chips
16:04 starts to activate wherever it is
16:06 because I've created sort of a a
16:11 photoelectric current inside the chip
16:15 now again that would require that the
16:18 chip is fairly close to the surface of
16:20 your skin if not right on top of the
16:22 skin I'm gonna I am actually predicting
16:24 in my mind that this is going to be like
16:27 tattoos it's going to be a badge of
16:29 honor to see how [ __ ] tyrannical and
16:31 fascist you can turn your body into you
16:35 will probably see a marriage of tattoos
16:37 piercings and chips honestly speaking if
16:41 you could put it on the end of a cursing
16:43 you could crease the proximity of the
16:46 chip away from your flesh and you might
16:48 actually survive the process long term
16:53 but again we're going to get into the
16:55 social impact of putting chips in your
16:58 body and what they might do to you if
16:59 you do so in just a sec here so let's
17:06 talk about what they gained by putting a
17:07 chip inside you that's the real question
17:11 right that's where you can start getting
17:12 into the motive who stands to benefit
17:15 that you might use to have a
17:16 conversation with someone who's yet to
17:18 know you know how this information
17:21 divulged to them what do we say on this
17:24 show in terms of them they always want
17:29 control now they want money too until
17:32 they have enough money to do anything
17:34 that they want which is a very quick
17:35 game that they play and so you know they
17:38 don't really sit around having
17:39 conversations about getting more money
17:41 they'll talk about people asking for
17:43 money too
17:44 to serve them but that's about it they
17:48 want control we have a paranoia that
17:51 what they have gained will be taken away
17:52 from them they fear that if they let
17:57 allow us to be too intelligent and learn
18:00 that we're going to find out the scan
18:01 that they are because what they do is
18:03 [ __ ] evil on this planet which is
18:04 called Ussery
18:05 and control and all that stuff but they
18:08 also fear that if they make is too dumb
18:11 that we get stupid and violent like a
18:16 lot of the police forces around the
18:17 country around the world excuse me have
18:20 lowered the IQ of the individual that
18:23 they're hiring such that we have a bunch
18:24 of droogies becoming cops now so the
18:27 good cops looking around going Jesus
18:28 Christ I'm surrounded by a bunch of you
18:31 know 90 IQ high towers that are just
18:33 looking for a reason to shoot [ __ ]
18:35 anybody which is why we have you know
18:37 handicapped people in wheelchairs
18:39 swallowing you know 16 shots to the dome
18:44 because the guy had to get a kill count
18:46 just playing call of duty able to
18:49 [ __ ] satiating the system anymore but
18:53 now what can a chip do well we talked
18:55 about the basics right it can provide
18:58 GPS information it can obviously
19:01 wherever it's put in the body it can do
19:04 a couple things one it can use Serpa
19:06 function in your body which might be a
19:08 medical application this is where
19:10 transhuman and tries to sneak into a
19:12 medical application while this person is
19:13 blind we're going to put a chip right on
19:15 the visual cortex and simulate using
19:18 this photo sensor or sight that one's
19:21 like hell yeah given the blind sight
19:23 Jesus Christ who's going to turn that
19:24 down with hearing all these different
19:28 things have been paired it can give you
19:30 an erection who knows right not a lot of
19:34 guys will get chips you can shock the
19:36 old
19:36 hooha guys let's hope they don't make
19:39 one that gives us women orgasms because
19:42 what the world would change in a day
19:45 well let's just take identifying you
19:47 you've got a chip somewhere on your
19:49 hands because your hands are usually
19:50 exposed to the world right and so it has
19:55 an identity
19:57 once you can be identified by a chip
20:00 then there's an amazing amount of
20:02 control because all the external
20:04 surfaces to your body can be dictated
20:07 and allowed using your identification
20:12 such as your money supply so what do we
20:17 do in this world we work we translate
20:20 the calories of energy that we expel
20:22 into monetary units monetary ends which
20:26 are again are connected to all kinds of
20:27 fiat methods of creating value but you
20:33 have to prove your connection with your
20:35 money supply in order to have a
20:36 transaction to live life right debit
20:40 cards credit cards pure cold cash coins
20:43 etc how much identity theft would exist
20:47 if you had to actually physically be
20:49 there with your chip you never carried
20:52 your card on you ever because you didn't
20:54 need to and so your identity theft
20:56 people are going to have to work
20:57 extremely hard to figure out a way to
20:59 steal whatever unit we have for remote
21:02 recognition but what if even buying a
21:05 product at home required your chip to be
21:07 present on your cell phone to then shake
21:10 hands with an e-commerce system on the
21:12 back end and stand by something it'd be
21:16 pretty badass because if a culture
21:18 switched to this then they can say oh my
21:21 god there's no more identity fraud for
21:23 the United States of America because if
21:26 we switched to a chip and this is one of
21:29 the reasons why your cards all have
21:30 chips in them now we all hate the
21:34 [ __ ] chip reader in the United States
21:36 now you're going to put your goddamn
21:37 card in the bottom of this credit card
21:39 reader takes four goddamn ever to
21:42 complete the transaction now you hate
21:45 your card let me go let's let that sit
21:48 there for a long time because they're
21:49 trying to bring on Apple pay to every
21:51 single thing on planet Earth Android pay
21:54 it's one more layer of middleman by the
21:57 way for the retailer so the retailer's
21:59 and I got to give a little chunk of it
22:00 to Apple give a little chunk to Android
22:03 whoever you know take care of the
22:07 transaction it's not very quick
22:12 putting your phone over the little
22:14 doodad at least right now it's no faster
22:17 than that chip thing so let's say that
22:19 they convinced a generation to move over
22:22 to this sort of cashless society which I
22:24 have a whole episode about and then just
22:27 like YouTube yanking advertising because
22:31 you're saying something that doesn't
22:33 match the fake news narrative and in the
22:35 military-industrial complex
22:37 fake narrative you're waking people up
22:40 you're identifying crisis actors in the
22:43 middle of false flag events someone
22:47 whispers to some whispers to someone and
22:49 then all of a sudden you lose all your
22:50 ad revenue making it strangling you
22:53 basically right making it impossible for
22:55 you to be a part of any movement where
22:56 you're waking up Society can you imagine
23:00 out of the show like this and I'm really
23:02 not that kind of show but let's just say
23:04 Infowars they figure out the top 100
23:08 sentences that you can read to another
23:09 human being in a particular order to
23:12 match a particular type of person and
23:13 you wake up completely
23:16 oh you're born in 1957 okay let me look
23:19 oh yeah okay so okay you ready statement
23:22 one statement two statement three and
23:23 then the by the time it's over these
23:25 people are completely awake but in order
23:28 to reach everyone it takes millions of
23:30 dollars to develop the questions develop
23:33 the statements it takes millions of
23:34 dollars but it's gagged its gagged so
23:40 you become a dissidents you become a
23:41 resisting force and all of a sudden your
23:47 little chip has problems how many of you
23:51 ever had electronic device that's
23:53 connected like this to your life fail
23:56 imagine you have one in the web of your
23:59 hand and somehow you injure your hand
24:03 somehow you shock yourself you touch
24:06 something and it shocks you maybe it's
24:08 wintertime you just have a big static
24:10 electricity charge in it discharges
24:12 right into your thumb or your index
24:14 finger and somehow it's a little bit of
24:17 a charge that then [ __ ] up your hand
24:19 the little chip inside your body it
24:21 fries it
24:22 you bang your hand someone you know does
24:27 something physically and now you have to
24:29 go back to surgery and because every
24:33 single state monitored surgery system is
24:36 going to take for fuck-all ever to
24:38 schedule you in and make it happen one
24:42 its mutilating your body creating scar
24:44 tissue which always runs the risk of
24:46 cancer but now it is a cancer creating
24:50 little machine in your hand so you're
24:53 basically just creating a cesspool in
24:56 your body an open sore a lesion so that
25:01 they can control you it can't be too
25:04 deep in your skin because the units have
25:05 to be interacted with the deeper goes in
25:08 your skin the more of an electromagnetic
25:10 field is going to require to talk to the
25:12 chip which means you're going to get
25:13 exposed to more and more TSA cancer rays
25:17 for your greater good well think about
25:22 it every single time you buy something
25:23 you're going to get exposed to more
25:26 lethal energy than a TSA body scan
25:29 potentially it's bad enough that the
25:32 cell phones schematics are cellphone
25:35 instructions inside your phone tell you
25:36 to keep it a quarter inch from your 3/4
25:39 of an inch away from your head otherwise
25:41 you'll catch cancer that's a phone now
25:46 obviously it has a massive power supply
25:47 and turning operating systems and doing
25:49 all kinds of wild [ __ ] make your hand
25:52 well it's embedded if it's part of some
25:56 piercing some dangling trinket on your
25:59 body you're gonna have that dangling
26:02 trinket on your body all day long you'll
26:05 never be able to get rid of it if it
26:07 gets snagged on a piece of clothing how
26:09 do you put your sweater on even if it's
26:12 real smooth it's there if it's a ring
26:16 someone can steal it
26:17 it's a piercing someone can steal it and
26:19 once they steal your chip christ
26:21 almighty they can go run all over the
26:24 place and charge up a bunch of stuff how
26:29 much do you think they would control you
26:31 if there was no limit to how much they
26:33 could control you
26:35 some of you will understand right away
26:37 they'd probably just in your life if
26:39 they could let's just say that one
26:42 cardinal rule was not easy for them to
26:44 pull off a mass murder the thing that
26:48 people don't realize when you talk about
26:49 the elite thinking about us we talk
26:52 about every once awhile there's two
26:53 terms when we're not at war they call a
26:56 sheep when we are at war they call us
26:59 cattle the Sheep what does she provide
27:02 right as she provides wool you keep it
27:05 alive it follows the dog it's easy to
27:07 hurt in two spots and that's the way it
27:10 works with cattle you're talking about
27:15 something that has been harvested and
27:18 raised to be slaughtered and eaten and
27:21 that's what our soldiers are to them
27:24 that is why the VA hospitals had never
27:27 been funded well for hundreds and
27:30 hundreds of years that's your proof so
27:34 now you put a chip in the human body and
27:36 you have unbelievable control over their
27:38 commerce by way of having access to
27:41 their money and having access or sorry
27:44 having the control over what they have
27:46 access to purchase based on a bunch of
27:47 policies now there was a great video
27:51 made in the late 90s where someone was
27:53 really thinking this thing through and
27:55 they created an interface where they had
27:59 a guy calling to buy a pizza and had
28:02 this fake conversation between a guy
28:04 calling for pizza and the operator who
28:06 answers the phone call at the pizza
28:07 place it's actually extremely well done
28:09 even though the interface is ancient now
28:12 what they did was they dramatized up
28:15 this notion and again some of us could
28:16 get behind this but then some of you
28:19 will understand where it could go
28:21 but the fictional character buying the
28:24 pizza was a diabetic was overweight and
28:27 was essentially costing the system a
28:29 tremendous amount of money and insulin
28:31 shots and medical care because of their
28:33 obesity and so as the as the odor
28:37 progressed the the the pizza operator
28:40 started getting sort of the HIPAA
28:42 information about this person their
28:43 medical information and saying oh you're
28:45 not allowed to buy this unless you pay
28:46 the surcharge
28:48 the surcharge being this is you pre
28:50 paying your medical treatment because
28:52 you're so unhealthy because you're obese
28:54 because you're diabetic it's a very
28:57 sobering video it goes on for like 10 15
29:01 minutes and it just keeps ratcheting up
29:04 and ratcheting up and it just shows you
29:06 the level of control that could be
29:08 exerted on humanity
29:10 it was very thx 138 a little bit of
29:16 idiocracy in there now let's look at the
29:19 trends of the youth of the world now I
29:24 know about you when I was young there
29:26 were a tremendous amount of trends that
29:29 were just came out of nowhere we dressed
29:32 like MC Hammer
29:33 you know after was a Spandau Ballet came
29:36 over unbeknownst to most of us and
29:38 showed you know we can wear a bunch of
29:39 floppy clothing Michael Jackson got up
29:43 and had his zipper jacket parachute
29:45 pants everyone started wearing that
29:47 stuff right it's an arbitrary thing that
29:50 we added to our body to give us style
29:52 and then of course the arbitrary pick up
29:54 music for whatever decade you're from
29:57 becomes the trend and it's sort of a a
29:59 phase and it's sort of harmless and some
30:02 people continue to wear their their
30:04 allure styles and that kind of thing it
30:08 not hurting anybody that's just the way
30:10 to do it great well that's a reality
30:12 every single decade that we've been on
30:15 this planet now imagine that this chip
30:19 thing gets stuck inside that envelope
30:21 they get stuck inside that mechanism to
30:24 make it popular except this time around
30:27 it has a transhuman quality to it a list
30:30 of benefits look at how all the social
30:33 justice warriors of the world have grown
30:36 addicted to the idea being a martyr or
30:40 being the savior of humanity because
30:43 they go to college they create a hundred
30:44 thousand dollars worth of educational
30:46 debt they come out and they can't get
30:48 hired pouring coffee and talk about
30:53 feeling useless talking about feeling
30:54 had and so they struggle to find any
30:57 arbitrary purpose in life and that's
31:00 where the devil swoops in every
31:01 I'm right okay and I don't necessarily
31:05 believe in a devil but you know what I'm
31:06 talking about I think the movie is
31:08 called Fright Night
31:10 it's about Dracula moving in next door
31:12 to this kid with a single mom it's the
31:15 guy that played the King in a princess
31:17 bride plays Dracula but there's a great
31:20 scene in that movie where there's a
31:22 little nerd kid who's always being
31:26 marginalized by his buddies he's called
31:30 the geek the nerd and eventually gets to
31:33 the point where he is so tired of being
31:35 called names that the Dracula character
31:37 says wouldn't you like to be immortal he
31:41 pulls out his big cape but he wraps it
31:43 around the kid and the kid becomes a
31:45 vampire
31:46 he's somebody now right it's no
31:50 coincidence and most the fans of Marilyn
31:52 Manson have become social justice
31:53 warriors they're the outcasts you can't
31:57 control their eating so the yellow
31:58 beasts so they get extra diet you know
32:00 they get too extradited to get you know
32:04 ostracized from humanity they're really
32:08 smart in some cases in certain areas of
32:11 life that make them geeks and so they're
32:13 pushed out of society well this is going
32:16 to be the target of this transhumanism
32:18 group imagine a human being that's never
32:23 able to keep track of their physicality
32:25 right they're always overweight but
32:26 always out of shape maybe they're old
32:28 maybe they're young doesn't matter
32:31 perhaps are even born with such bad
32:34 habits that their genetic pool just gets
32:36 so corrupted so quickly that they're
32:38 always sick and a transhuman scientist
32:41 comes in and says you know what I can
32:43 put you in a [ __ ] robot give you a
32:44 cyborg we'll just lift your brain out of
32:47 your head
32:47 got all these little connections we'll
32:49 make to it and you can be a Robocop it's
32:52 exactly like the vampire coming up to
32:54 the kid and saying I'll make you a
32:55 vampire but now here's the thing
32:59 episodes like this and other
33:02 conversations which are much more
33:03 in-depth and much more scientific than
33:05 mine that are online already if we can
33:09 pre expose the kids to the scam then we
33:12 get to prevent the next generation from
33:14 jumping in
33:16 there'll always be those rebels it'll do
33:19 it must be those communities that never
33:21 got the information they will jump in
33:24 and they will suffer the slings and
33:26 arrows of tyranny but it's better that
33:29 we actually have some weird European
33:31 community that was duped to get into a
33:34 nightclub one the nightclubs not doing
33:35 any favors right shitty partner
33:40 selections you know venereal disease
33:43 cesspools you're drunk all the time
33:46 you're on drugs all the time and by the
33:49 way you're at the front of the lines you
33:50 go first you're the most [ __ ] up of
33:52 the whole bunch because you have a chip
33:53 in you're in if there's ever a chip that
33:57 controls your e-commerce or your
34:00 commerce in general and one of them
34:02 breaks and your friends like oh my god I
34:04 was on vacation and someplace in the
34:08 world my chip broke I couldn't feed my
34:12 family couldn't feed myself it was
34:14 horrible
34:16 it's better we have those little one-off
34:19 situations then you have the whole world
34:22 go at once but believe me they are
34:25 dreaming up a way to make this a trend
34:27 on a cultural level and I want to make
34:30 another point about this and that is
34:32 that right now our two silliest pop
34:36 science blowhards are neil degrasse
34:39 tyson and bill nye this those two guys
34:41 tend to get the most exposure here in
34:43 the United States well there are
34:47 probably two or more upcoming
34:51 individuals that are going to be
34:52 incubated to have this credibility like
34:55 an Elon Musk character right this total
34:58 phantom character out of South Africa
35:02 it's crazy about that guy is that he
35:05 just goes around the world you know
35:09 seemingly pretty unhealthy physically so
35:12 he doesn't have the drop on how to
35:14 [ __ ] be you know balanced and this
35:17 guy just makes [ __ ] up and the press
35:18 just [ __ ] puts it in the papers I
35:20 mean you know SpaceX which is nothing
35:24 more than a computer graphics company
35:28 building props has claimed to do all
35:31 these things that NASA couldn't do for
35:32 50 goddamn years
35:34 you know how long nASA has been trying
35:36 to launch a rocket up in the sky move it
35:38 over and land it back down and its back
35:39 that is a program that is older than the
35:42 moon missions they've been trying to
35:44 that [ __ ] since the 60s and they crash
35:47 virtually every single time I think only
35:50 the last 10 years have we had one
35:52 successful attempt by NASA it was the
35:54 most clumsy [ __ ] thing you ever see
35:56 in your life it was like luck of the
35:57 draw man and SpaceX Jesus Christ they
36:03 can seemingly just have a giant throw
36:04 their rocket into the sky and they've
36:06 got retro rockets to land it on a moving
36:08 barge in the [ __ ] foreign right it's
36:12 crazy but this guy just announces one
36:16 outrageous [ __ ] thing after the other
36:19 that no professional institutions been
36:21 able to do doesn't mean that someone
36:23 can't do it that easily right as Steve
36:25 Jobs had been involved getting us to the
36:27 moon I guarantee if something would be
36:29 on the moon for real maybe he's that guy
36:31 but the level of ridiculousness
36:35 coming out of this dude really begs the
36:38 question of whether or not he's real at
36:39 all there's people trying to find out
36:43 his background because no one heard
36:45 about the guy at all till he was
36:46 involved in making the Tesla company a
36:48 buddy of mine was involved in filming to
36:51 test the company at the Roadster level
36:54 before the Roadster even been drivable
36:57 but you know we've got we're just
37:00 waiting for Elon Musk to say you can
37:02 travel through time and take us to the
37:07 Wizard of Oz you know I mean this dude
37:09 is absolutely out of control with his
37:11 claims now it's nice to have an
37:15 inspirational person in society to make
37:17 us think he'll kay we've we've gone long
37:19 enough without anti-gravity one of the
37:23 mid-60s every professor in every major
37:25 College in the United States of America
37:27 had a philosophy of how to do it but
37:30 like I said in a previous episode if we
37:31 could operate willy-nilly in the world
37:33 then they would lose complete control of
37:36 humanity you know the idea of creating
37:39 an Isis
37:40 to take over all of the middle-eastern
37:43 foes of the banking your bankers in
37:44 Europe well [ __ ] if they can fly around
37:46 on hoverboards or flying intertubes they
37:52 come right to America because in their
37:55 brain they're never told enough to
37:56 really know what they're doing their
37:57 total skills and tools of the
38:01 intelligence agencies they got nothing
38:03 else better to do most of them can't
38:06 afford a gallery to get married so it's
38:08 like you're never going to get laid
38:10 legally in the under the eyes of Sharia
38:12 law what else you got to do let's fight
38:16 to the death and once you take away a
38:19 man's reason to live he becomes the most
38:21 dangerous living being on this planet
38:24 and that's why they're failing right now
38:29 they being the bankers have so impacted
38:33 humanity that a lot of people waking up
38:36 with no reason to live that's why you
38:37 have these protests all over the world
38:39 Berkeley in Paris they can't see a
38:43 future
38:44 all right digression off cell phones are
38:48 the practice run for what can be done
38:52 with chipping they want to usurp the
38:57 five senses of man and perhaps add a few
39:00 to control us even further but all of
39:03 our instrumentalities our eyes our ears
39:06 our tastes are touch they want it all
39:10 then imagine them we'll just put this
39:15 out there for you imagine that these
39:18 microchips can do a couple things
39:19 control your economy meaning your access
39:22 to your money
39:23 therefore you can't buy anything that
39:25 they haven't pre-approved and they'll
39:27 come up with some excuse some policy
39:29 when you're not allowed to buy that how
39:31 could you buy anything that is say a
39:34 cure to cancer if they deem it's not a
39:36 cure for cancer
39:37 the FDA today is coming out against a
39:40 bunch of companies that are making
39:41 claims and I'm sure that there's a bunch
39:43 of companies out there selling snake oil
39:45 saying it's curing cancer but we know
39:46 that there's a cocktail of vitamins that
39:49 you can take be 17
39:51 and see a bunch of other things to get
39:54 yourself straightened out and they say
39:57 it's illegal for you to buy these things
39:59 if we think that you're going to be
40:02 interrupting the trillion dollar
40:03 industry that is cancer treatment with
40:06 the the scam that is the depopulation
40:08 mechanism of the world member cancer
40:10 provides a depopulation mechanism to
40:12 make sure no one gets that old and it
40:14 also provides a means for them to bleed
40:16 your family drive any money that you
40:18 have by charging you for your cancer
40:20 treatments really to get you through the
40:23 insurance policy and deduct deductibles
40:25 oh they'll just get you for what's not
40:27 covered by the insurance of the
40:28 deductibles so they can kill you at will
40:32 really they can force you to buy food
40:34 it's GMO buggies chips they can force
40:38 you to take treatments otherwise you die
40:41 really fast after you get sick and if
40:44 you so much as intellectually challenged
40:46 them they could just turn off your
40:47 entire money supply and imagine that
40:51 imagine you have someone on your family
40:53 that's helping the world to wake up and
40:56 so they immediately get sanctioned
40:58 monetarily speaking your chips turned
41:00 off and then what they do is you say
41:03 what you say what's okay my family will
41:05 buy extra food with their units and
41:09 they'll feed me well what if they
41:13 penalize everyone you know because they
41:16 know via your chip GPS who you're by
41:20 they know that you have four members
41:22 that live inside the same houses you
41:23 only put everyone on restricted rations
41:25 to ensure they only have enough money to
41:28 buy the food to keep themselves alive
41:31 making sure they can't give you any food
41:34 the algorithms of control are absolute
41:39 when they get us microchipped
41:42 and again they're probably going to
41:45 create some really nice systems that are
41:47 going to be able to make us better right
41:50 second thing we have another type of
41:54 chip that is being talked about a lot
41:58 and it's been experimented with a lot
42:00 and that's the Nano systems that are
42:03 injected into your blood supply little
42:06 tiny microscopic robots that have the
42:08 ability to procreate using the atomic
42:10 matter inside your body they also have
42:13 them the ability to dismantle themselves
42:15 and be passed out as waste in your body
42:17 they're talking about creating you know
42:19 swarm technology that will go after a
42:21 tumor again the first pitch is always a
42:25 Robinhood pitch we're going to save you
42:28 somehow save save say good good good
42:31 right behind that is pure evil it's only
42:37 because we allow these people to gain
42:39 power and control over us through all
42:42 the traditional mechanisms of money
42:45 manipulation that's really it the second
42:49 that we stop allowing them to make our
42:50 fiat currency they lose all power they
42:54 can't buy our politicians anymore
42:56 they can't manipulate military
42:59 industrial complexes to send our
43:00 children off to be killed in these
43:02 ridiculous Wars they don't have the
43:04 money to create fake news I mean they'll
43:07 have money for a while but the second we
43:10 expose fake news for what it is and say
43:12 you're talking to me like a journalist
43:14 which is some condescending voice tone
43:17 no more everything you've been trained
43:20 to do you're obsolete now
43:23 instantaneously this is why I'm in my
43:28 opinion is so important that we wake up
43:29 and we wake up as fast as possible and
43:32 I'll tell you a little digression about
43:34 waking up with this information
43:36 information like this is that you'll
43:38 wake up and like I've said several times
43:40 they'll be super excited about the
43:42 information that you've learned but
43:43 you'll know deep down inside you don't
43:45 really have all the motives all the
43:47 science all of their thinking because
43:49 they're the second that let's say you
43:50 wake up to this microchipping thing you
43:54 have to understand that right now the
43:55 microchip
43:56 being conversation among the elite of
43:58 the world is 40 years old if not more
44:01 according to Erin Rizzo Nick Rockefeller
44:03 was talking to him about this in the
44:05 early 80s and I mean like 81 well if
44:08 they're willing to talk to him about it
44:09 in the early 80s how far back does it go
44:11 before that it was a pipe dream in the
44:15 70s to say we're going to miniaturize
44:17 chips and put them in the human body
44:18 because everything was massive big
44:22 silicon wafers were just big chunky
44:25 things that they're buoyant in fact they
44:26 weren't as large as they are today but
44:29 as things miniaturized it became very
44:33 viable so let's say you wake up to this
44:36 and you go five ten years and you put
44:38 some effort into it you try to think of
44:40 way they think you don't need any
44:42 conspiracy videos of any kind or any
44:43 other dialogue to really pretend that
44:46 you're them and pretend you've got their
44:48 paranoia of someone waking up and taking
44:50 away everything that they have but
44:53 that's their thought every single second
44:55 of the day eventually you'll start
44:58 boiling things down so beautifully that
45:01 you can communicate to other folks
45:03 that's why I try to make these videos
45:05 after I've had a chance to boil this for
45:07 10 years
45:07 the microchipping thing in my history is
45:11 at least 10 years old and thinking about
45:13 it there's a great movie out there which
45:15 is Natalie woods last movie Christopher
45:18 Walken's one of his legendary films
45:20 called brainstorm the people I've talked
45:24 to they're you know my age they love it
45:26 or they hate it I don't know why you
45:27 would hate it but they created a
45:29 technology which was basically virtual
45:31 reality you recorded a person's five
45:33 senses into a tape and then you could
45:35 play it back and whoever's playing it
45:38 back has every single physical reaction
45:42 that you had and you were in it so your
45:44 heartbeat matches theirs if they have an
45:46 orgasm you have an orgasm on and on and
45:49 on and it was a laboratory being funded
45:53 by the government and it was Christopher
45:56 Walken and the woman he plays nurse
45:58 ratchet in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
46:00 Nest they have this research and they're
46:04 trying to create beautiful things with
46:05 it of course there were some renegade
46:07 guys that had sex with the tapes and
46:09 sold
46:09 those around the laboratory or gave him
46:13 away or whatever but very quickly in
46:16 this film the military swoops in with
46:18 this guy in a white suit the sort of
46:20 albino guy in a white suit which just
46:22 happens to match one of the guys that
46:24 I've met in the world who worked for JPL
46:26 creating terrain rendering software
46:29 which is where we get all of our
46:30 pictures of Mars from and it became
46:33 really evil really fast and they
46:35 immediately took the technology and
46:36 create all these military training
46:38 things a very MKULTRA sort of mind
46:40 control tapes and one of the Christopher
46:45 Walken's Sun which is Natalie woods son
46:47 in the film puts his headset on and
46:51 plays one of the most incredibly toxic
46:53 tapes ever and he nearly dies until his
46:56 father played by Christopher Walken it
46:58 runs in the room and knocks the headset
46:59 off his head and then very quickly in
47:02 the film they get locked out his partner
47:05 played by a nurse ratchet character she
47:07 dies and he's trying to access a tape
47:10 because she put the damn headset on when
47:13 she died she recorded the afterlife in
47:15 one of these headset recordings and he
47:17 just wants to listen to it
47:19 there's probably few slopes that are
47:22 more slippery than than transhumanism
47:25 because you have the allure to walk to
47:29 the edge of this cliff for medical
47:31 improvements on your body
47:33 perhaps just technical improvements in
47:34 your body but the the slope becomes a
47:39 cliff and becomes very slippery and
47:42 curved and it's where you can fall off
47:45 into the precipice of tyranny so you
47:49 know there's there's great arguments to
47:51 fix eyesight and hearing and to
47:54 rehabilitate a heart to perhaps create
47:57 nano systems that will go inside the
47:59 mind and rid us of mercury and aluminum
48:01 and cancerous cells restoring the you
48:05 know the health of the brain in them in
48:06 the body
48:07 we're probably 10 20 years away from
48:10 really any major implementation of those
48:12 high-end transhumanism features I just
48:16 need you to know that the evil that will
48:18 grow at the same exact rate if you have
48:20 two columns
48:21 of pros and cons to tune in to systems
48:25 and chips in the human body for everyone
48:29 that's good there's at least one that's
48:31 bad and really bad the elite of the
48:33 world have bragged supposedly over and
48:35 over and over to multiple people around
48:37 the world if they want to really reset
48:39 this planet back to very very small
48:41 population is dictated by the Georgia
48:43 Guidestones and it's going to be the
48:47 people that are selected to be there the
48:50 thinkers not people think like us the
48:53 people who think like them and the irony
48:55 of it is if you had a bunch of them in
48:58 one room but no one would do any laundry
49:01 and they would be plotting to kill each
49:04 other because their genetic paranoia is
49:06 absolute they're unhealthy human beings
49:09 so think you feel me I want to do a
49:13 specific episode on chipping human
49:15 beings because I think it's it's one of
49:19 the things that so far has gone
49:20 underneath the radar and you see the
49:23 article here and there and you blow it
49:25 off and believe me they're only
49:27 releasing the information that they
49:28 think will lure people to it they're not
49:31 releasing anything else so I think we
49:33 need to stimulate the conversation so if
49:36 you have there's plenty of videos out
49:37 there if you have a great video that you
49:39 know that really gets into this in-depth
49:40 and talks about some of the stuff and
49:42 maybe some stuff I didn't talk about
49:43 please post it in the comments below
49:45 because it's something that we need to
49:47 kind of incubate up you know I don't
49:51 know that we can create policies to keep
49:53 it from spreading into the bad column
49:56 there's always a secret laboratory
49:57 well-funded by someone that will be bad
50:01 but until we replace our leaders with
50:03 good folks who fight for us personally
50:05 you consider themselves nothing but a
50:07 servant to man we're running a huge risk
50:10 of losing all control of our lives so as
50:14 of this recording and this is part of
50:16 season 3 which I haven't even done the
50:18 season 3 intro yet everything has been
50:21 moved over to deep thoughts radio calm
50:22 for everything so if you're
50:27 traditionally used to the audio feed you
50:32 need to get everything reset over to
50:33 deep thoughts radio so
50:35 move the MK ULTRA video site directly
50:37 deep thoughts radio so you don't get
50:38 confused hopefully but it's on video if
50:41 you're on audio it's on audio if you're
50:42 on video until I need to know
50:44 always appreciate you guys listening to
50:46 the very very end thank you so much take
50:50 care of yourself and someone else I'll
50:51 see in the next deep thoughts over now
