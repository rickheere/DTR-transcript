00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to D thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this episode we're going to
00:39 ask the critical question that even
00:43 though I've made several dream episodes
00:44 I haven't really asked the most
00:46 fundamental question which is someone
00:48 like me isn't it what are dreams what
00:54 are they I will have you know we beat
00:57 our other record it's 38 degrees out now
01:00 let me give you a little bit of
01:02 background for those of you who've
01:03 watched the show for a very long time
01:04 this background is not new to you
01:08 I dream exquisite dreams super
01:15 unbelievable intense dreams which in
01:19 most cases bears a direct similarity to
01:23 reality and so when I wake up in the
01:26 morning I have to be birthed into this
01:28 universe there's an extremely
01:31 interesting process it is judging from
01:35 my friends I talked to and I have some
01:38 friends that have dreams that I think
01:39 surpass mine by quite a bit but mine are
01:43 it's it's just like when I go to bed if
01:46 any of you've seen the episode and I
01:48 forgot what it is it's it's in the next
01:51 generation Star Trek series where this
01:53 probe floats up to the enterprise and
01:58 jean-luc Picard gets yanked into this
02:03 alternate reality where he lives the
02:06 remainder of his life all the way to old
02:08 age lives with this colony this is not
02:12 going to hurt anything for you if you
02:13 haven't seen it this is pretty much the
02:15 setup and then he does manage to come
02:19 back of course everybody assumes that
02:20 the show is gonna go on he's going to
02:22 die in this alternate world but he lives
02:24 a full life inside this probe and we
02:28 know this the whole time the story
02:29 that's in the probe is what's
02:31 interesting with which I will not tell
02:33 you but it's the it's actually one of
02:35 the very first episodes where they did
02:37 not plays the closing credit music as
02:40 the show exited he played something else
02:43 which I'll let be in mystery for you who
02:46 haven't seen it who haven't
02:47 just seeing such a thing it's he's plays
02:51 it out of a piccolo sort of instrument
02:54 every time I see that episode or think
02:56 about that episode or have a dream it
03:00 reminds me of every day I wake up
03:02 usually and I think most people have
03:06 that sort of experience which is why I'm
03:08 gonna make this episode and in lichen
03:11 all of our experiences to this alternate
03:17 universe so what is the dream well if
03:21 you talk to scientists what can they
03:22 possibly tell you well you have the the
03:27 psychiatric side of it the Freud side of
03:29 it who really came first because we
03:32 didn't have a bunch of equipment to hook
03:34 up to the mind to see the electrical
03:37 activity of the brain during a dream I
03:39 don't believe so
03:40 during his time so he came at it saying
03:44 ok well he came up with a bunch of sort
03:49 of updated modern interpretations of
03:51 what dreams mean I think some people do
03:56 take what's going on in their real life
03:58 and somehow manifest it into their dream
04:02 I'm not completely devoid of that like I
04:04 said the time that happens with me is
04:08 mainly if I played a particular type of
04:10 video game with a particular type of
04:11 mechanic over and over and over again
04:13 what really happens in that scenario is
04:16 that I don't have a dream like normal I
04:20 don't go to my alternate universe and
04:22 live with my alternate dream people I go
04:25 into this sort of repeated level I'm
04:30 staring down at the game and it just
04:32 goes in a circle goes in a circle goes
04:34 in a circle so I don't really have a
04:36 dream there's nobody really in the dream
04:38 as this siren goes nuts in the
04:41 background
04:41 I forgot out later it is a little after
04:45 three o'clock in the morning you know
04:48 you just got a record when you got a
04:49 record right so there seems to be this
04:52 situation that Freud is correct in that
04:57 we do have a direct participation in our
05:01 dreams whilst what I have a dream about
05:03 a mechanic but now what if I completely
05:07 relaxed and I've had a good day and I go
05:09 into my dream and I have no
05:11 preconceptions about what's going on
05:14 when I get inside my dream it's always a
05:15 mystery of like oh where am i oh yeah oh
05:17 yeah okay
05:18 we're in this building were on this
05:20 vacation we're in this ranch we're in
05:22 this beach house or at a lake house you
05:25 know when I have a normal dream
05:28 personally for me
05:29 meaning not a frustration dream I don't
05:34 really have nightmares anymore there's
05:35 definitely some moments when scary
05:38 things will happen in my dream but I
05:39 just get so [ __ ] into it now it's
05:41 crazy if there's a monster in my dream
05:43 I'm like Roy batty going after the
05:47 [ __ ] you know and guess what it
05:49 never wins it never wins ever now
05:53 sometimes I like to do cat and mouse
05:55 games with dreams where I'm having like
05:59 an alien invasion dream I've had that
06:01 several times especially after I saw
06:02 battle Los Angeles which I just
06:04 mentioned in a previous episode I
06:05 created my own sort of version of those
06:09 aliens and it was fun I was in some sort
06:12 of military base and it was totally on
06:17 provoked and no one knew this invasion
06:19 was coming we I was outside at first on
06:22 this beach and I guess this bases
06:25 against a beach which makes almost no
06:27 sense but those exist but this was
06:30 interesting so I'm out there and there's
06:32 sort of like some things that I guess
06:34 were buildings and they got blown up a
06:37 little bit and so I'm in sort of the
06:38 foundation of this building that's
06:40 missing a roof it's only like a
06:41 single-story it's kind of storage
06:43 facility or whatever it was broad
06:44 daylight that was the best part the
06:47 broad daylight and and I'm looking out
06:50 over the beach which is what the movie
06:52 does
06:52 there's a big innovation from the water
06:54 and you know they're there and [ __ ] man
06:57 we've got these weapons and they got
06:58 weapons and finally I was realizing well
07:01 bunch more coming and we're not prepared
07:03 so I'm gonna go inside and so everyone
07:06 inside is going nuts they're running
07:08 down the hallway he's trying to figure
07:09 out where to go and I looked just inside
07:12 this one firewall door you know it's
07:15 like a good firewall made of cement you
07:16 know and you can tell there's like a big
07:18 door big sealed door almost like a ship
07:20 door and they hadn't closed it anything
07:23 but I went inside there and turned left
07:24 and I look inside and there's sort of
07:26 like this infirmary like a little tiny
07:29 medical room probably I don't know eight
07:32 to ten feet wide and probably about 20
07:34 feet long and it had a window way up on
07:37 the top that was kind of old and dirty
07:41 you said think it was but the whole
07:43 thing looked like it was meant to be
07:44 sealed like it was meant to keep people
07:47 in there and keep them safe and my brain
07:49 was probably inventing it right because
07:50 if we needed it to happen but everything
07:52 was round steel inside the room as if
07:54 when this building was built that was
07:55 some module that was pushed in and then
07:57 cemented in right and so I go in and I I
08:03 noticed it's a safe place I mean you
08:05 know relatively speaking of what else is
08:07 going on out there and so I'm in the
08:09 hallway and I'm trying to you know get
08:10 people to come inside we managed to get
08:12 about half a dozen people inside in the
08:14 hallway when empty and so I'm like help
08:16 me guys bond we close this door and it
08:18 was so exciting so exciting that these
08:22 aliens were out there and we'll just see
08:24 if they find us right the dream ended
08:27 fairly shortly after we got in there but
08:31 I do remember you know them I could hear
08:33 them outside and I was just wondering
08:35 did they are they gonna clear I mean I
08:37 would you would think they'd clear out
08:38 all the rooms that were open before
08:40 they'd go for a room that was sealed so
08:41 it kind of bought us some time
08:43 we got no weapons of any kind anymore
08:44 whatever I had on the beach was gone but
08:47 my part of my hope was that by slowing
08:49 down the capture process they could have
08:51 time to relax themselves and realize
08:53 that no one's armed in this room and so
08:56 you opened the door and we can maybe
08:57 talk about hurt or whatever how naive I
09:00 was during the invasion and then but
09:04 again my normal dreams
09:05 have no one I know and it usually except
09:10 maybe a celebrity I think I've said that
09:12 in the past you know and then but it's
09:17 always super positive right it's never
09:20 sad usually if it's sad it's sad and
09:23 maybe in a daring way like the guys told
09:26 you the one time I met my grandmother
09:27 had been passed for 25 years and I was
09:30 like a little kid and I didn't realize I
09:32 was a little kid until I spoke and I
09:33 hurt my voice really small and I was
09:35 like I was giving her a hug and she's
09:37 giving me a hug and I'm like grandma
09:39 you're not you're not in my world
09:41 anymore you're gone you know I just held
09:44 onto her until the dream ended which was
09:47 probably all of maybe 30 seconds still
09:51 feel pretty amazing so what could the
09:54 scientists who study the brain be seeing
09:57 well I think that they are seeing merely
10:00 the frequency echoes of how our
10:04 potentially our soul and our brain
10:07 metabolized this stuff out of the
10:10 universe itself
10:11 right I know that might just be a big
10:14 jump for anyone who's brand-new to the
10:15 show like oh my god here he guy was
10:17 gonna be bad Jesus Christ that's a this
10:19 is not a religious conversation
10:21 whatsoever at all this is a biological
10:25 symbiotic man and his organized energy
10:30 that is his identity which is why the
10:33 brain can never be really figured out by
10:35 man because it's not really there who we
10:39 are in our consciousness is not there no
10:41 here's a very interesting thing there
10:44 have been a few articles going around
10:46 where countries have given the right to
10:49 attempt to resuscitate people who are
10:52 dead and you know there's some if
10:57 there's been someone who's been dead
10:59 let's just say for I don't know an hour
11:02 and someone resuscitates that person
11:05 with an electrical Frankenstein shock
11:07 and they don't have any oh they still
11:10 have their identity I might rethink how
11:14 we are put together okay but as of
11:17 current state
11:19 you know 2019 information we have people
11:22 that pass away for a very limited amount
11:25 of time and they seem to go up and have
11:27 conversations with someone they do feel
11:30 like they lift away from their bodies
11:33 and they see their bodies that's what
11:34 almost everyone says and they return
11:37 after someone says this isn't your time
11:40 or something happens right now within
11:43 that's some chemical reaction in the
11:44 brain or whatever I don't know but again
11:46 you have to understand that the people
11:48 that it's almost like the same people
11:51 who talk about the Big Bang being real
11:53 they'll tell you over and over and over
11:55 the Big Bang's the way the universe
11:57 started okay [ __ ] yeah yeah and
11:59 what's gonna rain tomorrow oh I don't
12:00 know with it so obviously you've got the
12:03 how the universe you know was invented
12:04 figured out right the idea is physics
12:09 breaks down the closer you get to the
12:11 actual bang itself right they never tell
12:14 you that they're mathematical science
12:17 which is truth okay math doesn't lie it
12:20 all breaks down the theory falls apart
12:23 right towards the beginning of the
12:25 universe and so but they don't tell you
12:26 that their whole system's foxx right
12:28 okay when it comes down to the brain the
12:31 only thing that they seem to know how to
12:33 do is had to damage and sometimes on
12:37 occasion repair the brain or medicate
12:41 you to change the way it functions right
12:45 well if you had a soul and attaches to
12:48 the top of your brainstem okay right
12:51 where your third eye exists okay
12:53 your pineal gland of all things then
12:57 there's going to be a moment with just
12:59 like a video camera that's taking analog
13:01 outside data and turning into digital
13:03 data and then when it like this this
13:06 microphone here is analog but it goes
13:08 down into a unit that transfers the
13:11 analog into digital such as you can hear
13:13 me later that's why it sounds so rich
13:15 and beautiful in this microphone if I
13:17 use the microphone in that camera it
13:19 would sound just you know empty and weak
13:23 and have no character okay so at some
13:26 point you're symbiotic other half the
13:30 one that stores all the universe
13:33 all the universes memories and data
13:34 which is why you have an infinite
13:35 harddrive it's gonna have to transfer
13:38 that into your biological system into
13:40 your nervous system and then when that
13:43 is starts occurring you start seeing the
13:45 effects of it right how many of you have
13:48 seen those blowup things that are
13:50 outside car dealerships with a The
13:52 Dude's a big gun of like weenie guy and
13:54 he just shakes in the wind well down
13:56 below as a fan and the fan is blowing
13:58 him against the winds of the day and as
14:01 the you know the wind escapes he changes
14:03 shapes right nobody questions how that
14:06 works well now if you want to know how
14:09 the wind is working you look at the
14:11 shape of the little tube thing and
14:12 you're like I see looks like he's got so
14:14 much psi and da-da-da-da-da well that's
14:17 all they're doing in a dream laboratory
14:18 is looking at the effect of your body
14:22 communicating with your soul in my
14:24 opinion and manifesting out of the
14:26 universe's databank something that you
14:29 might I don't know be obsessed on seeing
14:31 right one of my thoughts with having
14:34 these reoccurring dreams after playing a
14:36 video game and it's usually like some
14:39 little some little tablet game or cell
14:41 phone game and it's usually when you
14:44 first find the game you OD on the game
14:46 and then you dream it then unfortunately
14:48 I would love to have a fallout 4 dream
14:50 never had one played the game for three
14:52 and a half years play the preceding game
14:54 two years right never had one dream of
14:57 it
14:57 would love to run around the wastelands
14:59 trust me but now what would it take for
15:01 me to play this video game over and over
15:03 what's going on inside my mind if you
15:05 think of it sort of as a combination
15:07 lock or something that's kind of a bunch
15:10 of rotating you know congruence circles
15:14 of gears and wires and stuff inside my
15:16 brain metabolizing the electricity such
15:19 that my mind can understand how to play
15:21 the game and play it quickly if that's
15:23 what I need to do or whatever I have
15:25 sent my mind into this pattern of
15:27 electricity over and over and over again
15:30 for hours and hours sometimes right
15:32 again when you first get into the game
15:33 usually want to have a dream using the
15:36 game mechanic and after a while I don't
15:37 have that anymore I'm not frustrated
15:40 with anymore like I am at level 100 30
15:42 whatever and I don't care I kill
15:45 everything with one shot
15:46 okay but up until that point I'm
15:48 obsessing and so then when I try to rest
15:51 my mind at night that churning doesn't
15:55 slow down right it's like if you were to
15:56 whip something really fast like water
15:58 and you pull the spoon out or whatever
16:00 it still spins even though you're not
16:01 spinning it that's similar to your brain
16:03 so I think I'm taking that pattern into
16:06 my dream cycle which is why it recycles
16:09 the theme of my game sometimes the art
16:12 works right there most the time it is
16:13 most the time its art work usually it's
16:15 like top down you know tower defense
16:17 games it get it get me really bad but
16:19 when I'm relaxed I have real dreams what
16:23 I call real dreams where I just let it
16:27 happen
16:27 I let the universe bring me something
16:29 bring me a world
16:31 the dreams that I have don't
16:34 overcompensate either they don't try to
16:36 be something that I don't know I mean
16:39 obviously life has you know it's aches
16:42 and pains emotionally physically
16:44 spiritually whatever and you know my
16:46 dream I'm not having those so it's nice
16:49 that I can't carry the paradigm of
16:51 suffering from this world into a dream
16:53 world when I was a kid and I had
16:56 nightmares I had two types of nightmares
16:58 I had nightmares where my toys were
17:00 coming after me and that's probably more
17:02 because my father was scaring the [ __ ]
17:03 out of me as a kid because he was a kid
17:05 too and then later it became a kind of a
17:09 disciplinary I'm being held in to an
17:13 area needed to do something couldn't do
17:14 it and so it was probably in my opinion
17:17 looking back and thinking about
17:19 reincarnation I am going from being a
17:22 free sentient adult popping through a
17:25 womb and then having to concede that I
17:29 don't get my way all the time and so the
17:32 theme of the dream was okay you're gonna
17:34 have to do what you need to do and the
17:37 idea that I couldn't do it in the
17:38 nightmare was maybe simply because I
17:40 didn't know how to satisfy people yet as
17:43 a young person in the real world and so
17:46 I took that combination system know
17:48 something maybe it was frustrating me
17:50 throughout the day and I brought it into
17:52 my dreams but now here's the interesting
17:54 thing
17:55 I pretty much sentient sentient lee
17:57 remember my [ __ ] life
17:59 from age three up I had this one I mean
18:03 I don't know my daycare I know exactly
18:05 how old what how old I was because
18:07 people ask me all the time how old it
18:08 was
18:08 and I was like a real chill kit man I
18:11 was just like I'm three three and a half
18:12 before next week whatever you know I
18:15 wasn't you know wasn't a ball baby I
18:18 [ __ ] hated all the things kids did as
18:20 a kid I was like I you know London
18:23 bridges for me it's like a devil song
18:25 carnival music sound like you know some
18:27 satanic room below the Vatican wasn't a
18:30 fear of it it was just oh god is this
18:33 how you entertain your young people of
18:36 your lifeforce because this is really
18:38 bad why don't we start thinking right
18:40 away let's do some science right away
18:42 and so when my uncle started teaching me
18:46 stuff when I got into art when I got
18:48 into art I was my own controller right I
18:51 got a pin in a I've started you know
18:54 sketching and then no one could stop me
18:56 if I wanted to make it photo real I did
18:58 it and I did it like eight or nine years
18:59 old right and then when I got into
19:02 painting that was even better I got
19:04 color and I did all painting first so
19:07 like my canvas would stay wet between
19:09 classes you know so I'm not quite sure
19:12 why those dreams lasted till I was
19:15 probably a seven years old really
19:17 strange but what kind of answers do we
19:20 want from the question of what is a
19:23 dream hmm well there if we take one step
19:29 back before that question why do we have
19:32 to go to sleep you know I asked that
19:34 question every time I do this episode
19:36 and I will probably not cease asking
19:37 that question until we come up with an
19:39 answer now scientists simply say because
19:42 you're exhausted sweetheart right
19:44 okay what if I slept all day can I stay
19:47 up two days nope
19:49 I'm on a biological clock as what they
19:51 say all right sure seems like that's the
19:54 case isn't it like you'll stay up and
19:57 then there's just this when you try to
19:58 break through the barrier of having your
20:01 sleep upside down I have to do it all
20:02 the time I need to do it right now I
20:04 need to go a whole 36 hours or whatever
20:06 to get back to my normal sleep habits
20:08 right I actually love getting up early I
20:10 love getting up or like anywhere between
20:13 five
20:13 seven I love it get a whole day's worth
20:15 of work in before it's even lunchtime
20:16 that's a beautiful thing and the whole
20:19 world's kind of ticking on that level
20:21 right now if you're creative in your
20:23 night L then the thing is obviously
20:26 about like right now I'm sitting in my
20:28 backyard right I guarantee you 90% of
20:31 this neighborhood is completely asleep
20:32 if I haven't woken them up and now I can
20:36 hear my own thoughts a hundred percent
20:37 but now they're all dreaming right now
20:39 aren't they maybe I also dream solutions
20:44 sometimes so this is another factor to
20:46 it I think I've told you guys in a
20:49 previous dream episode and many many
20:51 years ago that when I was oh it's by 15
20:57 years old
20:58 I had a dream in my little town and in
21:01 Kansas and I was an engineer I was above
21:04 I was a software engineer and I knew
21:05 Hardware fairly well but I had a dream
21:10 where I was playing a video game
21:11 just stand up coin off video game and
21:15 this is it's not technically before any
21:18 of this technology existed but it was
21:19 they didn't exist at this location
21:21 especially the way it happened to me but
21:22 my parents came up to me and the dream
21:24 it said come on we got to go and I said
21:27 okay let me save my game and I pushed a
21:31 button on the coin up game and it
21:34 downloaded that it froze the game and
21:36 downloaded onto a ram stick that I
21:38 pulled out and ran off with this is 1985
21:40 and so when I woke up I thought man
21:43 that's a great [ __ ] idea and so I
21:46 think obviously it was stuck in the
21:47 middle of nowhere no resources I
21:50 couldn't do anything about it
21:52 but what I started to think about was
21:54 that you know everyone was trying to
21:56 make car stereos as great as possible
21:57 first there's eight tracks then there's
21:59 cassettes and then eventually they put
22:02 DVDs or CDs excuse me into cars but
22:05 still if you hit something hard the
22:06 goddamn thing would would skip on on the
22:10 CD or it would go quiet right until it
22:13 caught back up with where it was which
22:14 was totally annoying and so I'm sitting
22:18 there it's about 85 86 and I'm thinking
22:21 Jesus we need to put everything on a RAM
22:22 stick then nothing's gonna break
22:24 nothing's gonna and I didn't even know
22:27 like how much a ram stick could hold you
22:30 know and I didn't know that Ram was
22:31 sticks were already inside of you know
22:34 your Atari 2600 your colecovision you're
22:36 in television you could you could keep
22:39 your you could keep the standard about a
22:41 memory you could use the same amount of
22:43 memory in the machine but if you need a
22:44 more space for those of you play the
22:47 blade at latest black mayor episode
22:48 you'll know this you can put extra
22:50 memory on the cart but that increased
22:52 the price of the product right you
22:54 didn't really want to do that if you
22:55 didn't have to but almost everyone I put
22:56 something in there by the way I'll give
22:59 you guys a little nerdy fact you can
23:01 share with your friends about that
23:02 latest black mirror the one where it's a
23:04 choose-your-own-adventure one the kid is
23:07 programming I can't remember I don't
23:10 really don't know what computer he's
23:11 using it looks almost like a Timex
23:13 Sinclair which has almost no memory and
23:14 no functionality but whatever I don't
23:18 know what unit that is and the kids code
23:22 is on screen and anytime you see the
23:25 code on the screen in that show once you
23:27 look for something because it's a bunch
23:29 of [ __ ] okay all the code looks
23:32 pretty standard code except you see a
23:34 rim statement in the code now if you
23:37 watch the the episode and you play it
23:39 there's a point every time you play it
23:41 that these coders are complaining about
23:43 running out of RAM for their game and
23:46 they're gonna have to in fact there's
23:48 even the conversation about installing
23:49 the ROM or starting selling more ram
23:51 into the cart from the indian guy that
23:53 runs the place right but look at the
23:56 code carefully when you play it look for
23:58 REM after a line of code that stood for
24:01 remark and that was the way you made a
24:04 comment in your code let me tell you
24:07 from being an old veteran back in the
24:09 day as a teenager you never wrote REM
24:12 statements and why because every
24:15 character takes up RAM and the last
24:16 goddamn thing you're going to do is eat
24:18 up your 32k of RAM with a rim statement
24:21 you're never gonna do it just all these
24:23 guys are bitching and moaning about
24:24 memory running out and they got REM
24:27 statements in their code so there you go
24:28 we'll little gift from me to you with
24:31 your friends and family but we're forced
24:33 to sleep every animals forced to sleep
24:36 so what is the dream
24:38 hmm what doesn't seem like we're getting
24:41 you know I mean I had some inventions
24:44 and dreams I know some of you guys have
24:46 had that as well but you know animals go
24:51 to sleep insects go to sleep yeah
24:53 there's probably a couple species
24:55 somewhere on this planet that don't
24:56 sleep I should look that up but almost
25:00 everything goes to sleep if not
25:02 everything I know what a tree does
25:04 because he just chills that all day but
25:07 if we were all getting these sort of
25:09 epiphanies while we sleep and I think
25:13 this world would be a [ __ ] ton better at
25:15 being nice to each other and the amount
25:18 of inventions would just be pouring out
25:19 of all the human beings in the world
25:21 yeah I guess there could be a conspiracy
25:23 on the backside that as we do ingest
25:25 fluoride and a bunch of other toxins
25:27 especially breathing that [ __ ] from the
25:29 sky that perhaps we are being limited
25:32 and ganked chemically from having decent
25:35 dreams maybe everybody had epiphanies
25:37 maybe Isaac Newton dreamed up most of
25:41 calculus you know who knows
25:43 there's a rumor from the band Kansas
25:50 coincidentally the the number one song
25:54 that Kansas ever wrote that made the
25:56 most money there's two really but the
25:59 second one is dust in the wind and the
26:01 third where the first one excuse me was
26:04 wayward son carry on wayward son is the
26:08 first lyric in that song the story goes
26:11 is the album was in the can all done
26:15 when the lead singer went to bed
26:17 exhausted and had a dream and he dreamed
26:21 wayward son and he came back to the
26:24 studio and said turn it all back on I
26:26 got this song and boom their best song
26:30 they've ever written was born
26:33 interesting so what is a dream I will
26:38 tell you this I'd started detoxing my
26:42 body dramatically at 2005 I cut off
26:46 aluminum deodorant I cut off aspartame
26:50 because I had a whole 12 pack on open
26:52 died dr. pepper in my refrigerator when
26:55 I made that decision I stopped brushing
26:58 with fluoride of course we're getting
27:00 fluoride in water so it's really hard to
27:02 avoid it and in its entirety but you
27:04 know stuffing it in your mouth is
27:06 probably the worst way to avoid it right
27:08 I spit it all out no you don't honey I
27:11 literally gave away my microwave not
27:15 that I cooked much in in any way
27:17 it's a beautiful microwave to look like
27:19 an HD TV was gorgeous no more that
27:23 anywhere I go if I'm at a coffee shop
27:25 and they say won't you eat that up for
27:27 you we're going how do you heat it up if
27:30 they say microwave I said no thank you
27:32 if they have one of those little
27:32 rotisserie things were goes in and falls
27:35 out the bottom no problem I'll take it
27:37 give me real heat I don't use any
27:40 fluorescent lights in my house it was
27:44 funny when I'm rewatching right now I've
27:47 moved on to Arrested Development of
27:49 which I've seen every episode but my
27:51 buddy and I are going through it one
27:53 more time and I forgot so much of it
27:55 it's fantastic I wasn't really analyzing
27:57 it before but there's a episode in there
27:59 where the sister gets in and takes over
28:02 his office manager for the Bluth
28:04 enterprises place and she turns off all
28:07 the fluorescent lights and puts in all
28:08 natural lights in the place and she goes
28:10 isn't is much better
28:11 it's brilliant video game companies do
28:14 not use fluorescent lights we don't use
28:17 them for one reason and that they
28:18 interfere with the color registry on
28:20 your monitor so your brain can't see
28:22 colors properly if you're lighting it
28:24 with fresh florescent lights so when i
28:29 detoxed my dreams became the dreams I'm
28:33 talking about so I want you to remember
28:36 that right now a listener just asked me
28:39 and this is sort of on the theme we'll
28:40 get back to dreams here in a second
28:42 because we have no time limits a
28:44 listener asked me if I had ever done an
28:46 episode on the food that I consume oh
28:49 that's interesting right I usually don't
28:52 get that personal or thinking that
28:55 whatever I'm taking is that interesting
28:56 you know you know a guy those of you
28:58 listen to the whole thing you know I
29:00 talk about every once in a while I did
29:02 do an episode on GMOs guessing if you're
29:05 interested just
29:06 go in the channel search on GMO it'll be
29:08 in there but you know if you are trying
29:12 to detox you're getting anxiety about it
29:14 because you like Jesus everything's
29:16 horrible you're right
29:17 here's what I do I definitely consume
29:21 crappy food it's just too difficult to
29:24 get around it right
29:25 I drink iced tea a lot so everywhere I
29:29 go instead of drinking sugar I will
29:30 drink like half a soda so if I get like
29:32 a drink I'll fill a pathway kind of
29:34 punch it down with the meal get that
29:36 sugar thing out of the way and then I
29:37 fill it to the brim with tea I usually
29:40 when I go to my breakfast joint I will
29:42 literally drink three gigantic glasses
29:44 of tea and then take one home with me
29:46 but I take vitamin C powdered
29:49 time-release vitamin C by Solera
29:52 it's a thousand milligram pill that
29:54 gives me five hundred right away and
29:56 five hundred over eight hundred eight
29:57 hours excuse me and then I take a b-17
30:00 pill which is a 250 milligrams pill
30:05 usually every day and that's how I back
30:09 up my body with extra support so that my
30:13 immune system can kick the living [ __ ]
30:15 out of anything that's going on inside
30:17 my body but what I do is I try to find
30:20 restaurants that are owned by families
30:21 and again they have to buy stuff from we
30:25 have a place called restaurant Depot
30:26 it's you have to have a membership to
30:28 get in there you have to prove you own
30:29 your own a restaurant cuz everything's
30:31 cheap as hell in there right buy a whole
30:33 pie for like fifteen bucks and when it
30:35 sells out the door it's sold for 50
30:37 bucks and when you cut up all the slices
30:38 right but I do look at the profile of
30:41 these restaurants I look at their
30:43 commitment to health and I will
30:45 typically go if I go to a personally
30:48 owned restaurant where I know the owners
30:49 they eat their own food the one thing
30:52 too you can do is look at the patrons
30:54 who eat at restaurants that they're
30:56 completely overweight and disgusting
30:57 well you just you just with moderation
31:01 go to those places you know I can hear
31:03 you eat here every day or I'm gonna gain
31:04 400 pounds you look at the people who
31:07 own the restaurant and see how fit they
31:08 are right I have one Mexican place I go
31:11 to where people aren't exactly the most
31:14 fit but then I get the I get fish with a
31:17 little bit of beans and rice and so
31:18 there's almost nothing
31:19 there it's fish it's beautiful it
31:22 doesn't have I don't get cheese on
31:23 anything
31:24 I find that my body really really
31:29 settled down once I got what a cheese
31:31 it's cool so you know that's sort of my
31:35 regimen I drink tons of smart water
31:37 which has been it's got a I think it's
31:40 reverse osmosis is what they say so
31:42 fluoride is not added to the water and
31:45 fluoride cannot survive the journey of
31:48 this filtration process that they use to
31:51 energize their water I think smart water
31:55 is probably a calling card to do people
32:00 who understand it to say if you're smart
32:02 you'll drink smart water because it
32:03 isn't any fluoride in it but there's a
32:04 new water called lava out of Iceland I
32:08 think it is and it actually says on the
32:10 bottle no fluoride it's awesome right so
32:13 by that [ __ ] by the case if you can get
32:16 if you live in Europe I think you guys
32:17 did it right you don't have a hell of a
32:20 lot of fluoride don't want them fluoride
32:21 your water fluoridate your water because
32:24 it's a medicine it's a medicine of
32:26 absolute toxin and you weigh a different
32:30 amount of weight than their for someone
32:32 else and no medication is going to be
32:34 unanimous across human bodies right
32:36 that's why they they give you different
32:39 dosages based on how big you are that's
32:41 why they weigh you when you go into a
32:43 medical office so that when they need to
32:44 write prescriptions is based on your
32:46 your weight but back to dreams here's I
32:52 think the fundamental argument that we
32:54 all have our dreams just throw away
32:57 events that have really nothing to do
33:01 with life you participate them
33:04 participate in them randomly based on
33:06 your day's events and are they all
33:09 explainable right if you have a white
33:11 unicorn in your dream you're gonna buy a
33:13 lottery ticket and win well I would say
33:17 to the degree you believe that manifests
33:19 that win the answer is probably yes as
33:22 simple as that sounds whatever you
33:24 believe in is usually what will start
33:25 happening to you right that's why you
33:28 want to get your mind straight right now
33:30 as much as my dreams are really why
33:32 and I have to make sure I put a
33:34 disclaimer near I hate the overtone that
33:38 may be what I am trying to say is my
33:40 dreams are great yours aren't please
33:43 understand that has nothing to do with
33:44 what I'm trying to say here okay I'm
33:46 just telling you that I
33:47 I actually struggle sometimes when I
33:52 wake up with going oh god back in this
33:54 reality [ __ ] okay
33:57 I mean I love this reality trust me but
33:59 the other ones it's full it's awesome
34:02 and are they throw aways our dreams
34:04 throw aways hmm well I would say that to
34:11 the degree that human beings need to be
34:15 in a wonderful place that is essentially
34:19 the same theme as one gets when one goes
34:22 on vacation whatever your vacation spot
34:25 is some beach in Europe because you
34:28 already live there a lake you like to
34:31 sit in Havasu set on a noodle with a
34:34 beer talking to your friends and just
34:36 chilling out catching up you like to go
34:39 to Hawaii maybe you just want to stay at
34:41 home I haven't been in my house I
34:43 traveled too much okay maybe to that
34:46 degree mankind needs dreams we need that
34:51 resting point I may have said it in my
34:54 previous stream episode I apologize for
34:56 not remembering it's been a while for
35:01 those of you who remember West world the
35:03 series on HBO there was a point
35:08 eventually in the movie in the show
35:12 excuse me the series on TV that the code
35:16 that was inside and this actually
35:18 happened in Star Trek as well it
35:20 happened for the ship's doctor that was
35:24 in voyager fact let's use him instead
35:26 that's a little bit easier i'm gonna
35:28 have to mess up west world at all what's
35:31 world had a flavor of this okay but the
35:33 big deal about the holographic doctor
35:35 was that he was only supposed to be on
35:36 for a short period of time to do triage
35:38 to assist that already-existing doctor
35:41 and then he was supposed to go away and
35:44 file away
35:45 and he was supposed to purse he was
35:47 supposed to reset generally most of his
35:50 knowledge about what is going on so he
35:51 comes in fresh every single time okay
35:54 this little saying is what's the nature
35:56 of your emergency he was what he would
35:57 always say as soon as he arrived and
36:00 then people would forget to turn him off
36:02 well eventually and his desire to be
36:04 human he kept his code running for a
36:08 very long time and in fact there was an
36:10 episode sorry where he wasn't allowed to
36:11 ever push back into the computer because
36:14 he had to stay awake for something I
36:15 can't remember what it was but that
36:17 ended up racking him emotionally because
36:21 his code wasn't perfect it hadn't been
36:24 really made bug-free for constant
36:26 existence perhaps as infinitely amazing
36:31 as we are our creators or maybe you know
36:36 I don't even know how to explain it with
36:37 [ __ ] evolution I don't our alien
36:40 creators or a god creator or both
36:43 realize that if we stayed up all day
36:45 long we turn into a mental patient and
36:48 that the solution was to simply rest
36:51 relax rest make about the universe in
36:56 general and again I'm gonna I'm gonna
36:58 lean on those of you who believe in God
37:00 and I'm gonna lean on those of you who
37:02 believe in Flat Earth at the same exact
37:04 time it could be God globe could be God
37:06 Flat Earth either way why not make a
37:09 world where it's lit all the time the
37:12 Sun never goes down it's always 73
37:15 degrees there's no winter it's beautiful
37:18 there's no hurricanes there's no
37:20 tornados it's beautiful that's not the
37:24 world we live in is it and because we do
37:26 have hurricanes and tornadoes and there
37:28 doesn't seem to be any logic in those
37:29 things existing it looks like we do live
37:32 in a fairly freeform entity it's being
37:36 allowed to exist as it exists warts and
37:39 all but we sleep everything sleeps hmm I
37:45 certainly feel like I have had a
37:47 vacation if I've had a great sleep and I
37:50 it's not just the rest it's not just
37:52 waking up going god I'm [ __ ] ready to
37:55 destroy this universe meaning get all my
37:58 dreams and make this thing
37:59 happen to own this baby right they also
38:02 say and I've mentioned this once before
38:04 but it's applicable here I have a book
38:06 on this when the book is all about the
38:09 fact that if one stays up 36 hours for
38:12 sure about 32 hours and they say it
38:15 happens at different times for different
38:16 people it depends on how much rest you
38:19 got the day before is really what it is
38:20 and how much you're used to sleeping so
38:22 if you're a 4-hour sleeper then it might
38:24 be a little sooner it depends on how
38:27 hardcore you crash at night when you do
38:29 crash right some people I envy you let
38:31 me tell you when you crash you're just
38:32 like and you just fall asleep in a chair
38:36 you're at the type of people they can
38:38 fall asleep in a car on a plane and I
38:41 think that's fantastic but they say that
38:44 the left brain the logical brain goes to
38:47 sleep ceases to function the electricity
38:49 from that portion of the brain just
38:52 really goes down to minimal services the
38:55 autonomic system and the scientists
38:57 scientists to figure this out started
38:59 subjecting themselves to these
39:00 experiments staying up really late and
39:03 then because they're scientists and not
39:05 really artists or creative people they
39:08 notice that the Inklings they did have
39:11 to be creative started to explode
39:14 doing whatever they do they didn't
39:16 really give a whole lot of examples as a
39:18 guy painted a bunch of paintings or
39:20 something like that but a bunch of these
39:22 I forgot what University was it's
39:25 written by one of the guys who was on
39:26 the team and he realized holy [ __ ] we're
39:31 getting creative at night just
39:33 coincidentally that's when you roll over
39:34 to the extra hours right so it makes me
39:37 wonder if you don't do what they're
39:41 saying think about it what they're
39:44 saying is is that when you go to sleep
39:46 in general you actually lose
39:48 consciousness your left brain also goes
39:51 I don't have to do anything we're just
39:54 laying here there's no survival tactic a
39:57 you know there's a big noise outside or
39:59 something like that I'll turn back on
40:01 and you know do an emergency response
40:04 circuit in the brain because we always
40:07 talk about what is the right brain to
40:10 it deals with reality as it exists well
40:15 my recent episode about left brain
40:17 activity the whole idea is we had a much
40:22 larger right brain we probably survived
40:24 off of our right brain more than we
40:26 survived off the left it but almost be
40:28 as if the left right brain would
40:31 delegate to the left brain what needed
40:33 to be addressed at any one point in time
40:37 because again the world is abstract the
40:41 world is chaotic the world is anything
40:44 can happen and it does happen so you're
40:46 if you are let's say living in some
40:50 jungle and you know there is a ritual in
40:52 the morning to go out and catch a bunch
40:54 of food with all the other males and the
40:56 tribe and you got your Spears and you
40:58 got your whatever rock slings whatever
41:00 it is you do then you're prepared for
41:02 that and you're orchestrating that event
41:04 but at some point in that indigenous
41:06 environment where they're predators a
41:09 lion could come up on your tribe it's
41:12 looking around for food it's hungry it's
41:14 trying to eat your kids at that point
41:18 the abstract brain is seeing this threat
41:20 come in and it's turning on the left and
41:23 it's saying you know all men to your
41:25 battle stations right when we dream at
41:29 least when I dream Boyet sir sir seems
41:32 like it is nothing more than my right
41:35 side of my brain living in a beautiful
41:37 abstract world now the one thing that
41:41 let's review some of the anatomy of
41:42 dreams because for those of you have
41:44 missed all my dream episodes and you
41:46 haven't watched them yet we have sort of
41:48 a list of things that we've sort of
41:51 assess both in the comments and then of
41:54 course from the episodes themselves one
41:57 we really don't have any
41:58 instrumentalities in our dreams
42:00 meaning we don't really have legs and
42:01 arms we synthesized the vision of them
42:05 when we need them we and again if you
42:08 ever try to use your hands in a dream
42:10 pay attention pay attention to how how
42:12 useless they are usually if it's a big
42:15 obtuse event that needs to occur
42:17 grabbing someone grabbing something
42:19 maybe you can do that one a little bit
42:21 faster but if you have to scratch
42:23 writing that's when you'll find out you
42:26 have you know overcooked spaghetti four
42:28 fingers the other one is is that reality
42:31 seems to only exist where you look
42:33 you're fussed hram I think it's not
42:37 frustum is fust room
42:38 it's the rectangle of which your eyes
42:40 can see which is actually pretty damn
42:42 wide right you have your peripheral
42:44 vision that has massive frame rates you
42:46 get 3d in the center and in your dream
42:48 you've got not quite the full spectrum
42:50 in my opinion I don't think I ever see
42:52 anything in my peripheral vision in a
42:54 dream but just like a video game like an
42:57 MMO when you enter that world and you
43:00 look around the engine is loading where
43:01 you're looking and it's trying to throw
43:03 away the assets behind you because it
43:04 wants to free up memory right it seems
43:07 that that's the way it works have you
43:09 ever gone through a door in your dream
43:10 and it was a double door and the doors
43:13 didn't seem to exist so they were pinned
43:16 open and then you went down and talked
43:17 to someone for two seconds you like oh I
43:19 forgot that thing we go back and get it
43:20 and you turn around and the doors
43:22 different it's still there but it might
43:24 be thinner might not have a central beam
43:26 maybe you got actually pushed the doors
43:28 open maybe they're French doors you get
43:31 it
43:32 what would an abstract and absolute
43:34 abstract part of your brain be doing
43:36 with reality especially if it had the
43:39 burden of creating it well one of the
43:42 reasons why I attached soul to the
43:44 conversation is that when I tell you
43:47 look and again I think it was Aristotle
43:49 that did this experiment let me give the
43:51 experiment first and we'll go into the
43:52 the advanced portion of the conversation
43:55 Aristotle played a game to create what's
43:58 called pluralism there was the atomistic
44:01 phase of our relationship with God which
44:05 is that when we started believing in a
44:07 higher being it was that God was here on
44:10 earth we are here and you just need to
44:12 be able to see God in everything right
44:14 Native Americans I think managed to live
44:17 their entire existence with this belief
44:19 system where as mother earth is God okay
44:23 but Aristotle would say close your eyes
44:26 and think of a perfect circle give it
44:29 give the stroke you know a little bit of
44:31 you know width
44:34 okay did you got it yeah is it perfect
44:36 oh yeah totally can you think of a
44:38 square and a triangle oh yeah totally
44:40 awesome now open your eyes here's a
44:43 piece of papyrus here's a writing
44:45 utensil now dip it in that ink over
44:47 there and draw a perfect circle and the
44:51 humans would go you know and you can get
44:53 kind of a circle but it is not looking
44:55 like the one in your brain that's
44:56 absolutely perfect and Sarah städel was
44:58 remembered to have said that proves
45:00 there's another realm of existence that
45:04 we don't have access to and that perfect
45:07 that perfection that perfectness that
45:09 you have instant access to as soon as
45:11 you close your eyes is proof that that's
45:14 where God lives and you live here and
45:17 then of course they exploded the whole
45:19 god worshipping thing into idols and you
45:21 know there's a God for absolutely
45:23 everything people would make you make
45:25 you an idol you could go down to an idol
45:26 shop and say you know I got a prostate
45:29 that makes me piss all night okay I'll
45:30 give you a prostate you know when they
45:32 give it to you right one of the greatest
45:34 movies out there by Dudley Moore it's
45:37 called holy Moses it's about him being
45:40 it's like life O'Brien he's being
45:41 confused with Moses he's not Moses but I
45:45 believe his father his father deals in
45:48 idols and so there's a scene where they
45:52 go into his dad's shop and his father
45:55 selling idols and it's just the funniest
45:57 thing where he's got an idol for
45:58 everything if he doesn't he'll make you
45:59 one it's really funny but I've said it
46:02 in a previous previous episode but now
46:04 that we're just analyzing the base
46:06 foundation of what a dream is think
46:08 about dreams for any of you've ever had
46:11 a dream in your life ever your brain is
46:15 able to portray reality beautifully and
46:18 even if you're having nightmares you're
46:20 still in the game whatever it is you're
46:22 scared of well I dream of this room and
46:24 it's this and that and his monster comes
46:26 out he's got horns and whatever all
46:28 right take a piece take a piece of paper
46:30 and a pen and draw that perfectly like
46:32 you see it in your dream you are
46:34 creating these things perfectly in your
46:36 mind well in computer software it took
46:40 from 1962 I think when Ivan Sutherland
46:43 put a pixel on the screen that's the
46:45 year all the way till
46:47 I don't know the mid-70s before we
46:49 started getting things that look
46:50 remotely photographic it wasn't until
46:53 probably Jurassic Park in 1993 that we
46:57 actually saw a dinosaur that was like
46:59 Jesus that looks real well the software
47:02 to create that and it was all invented
47:05 during the 80s it was that vintage
47:06 Ernie's but it was certainly perfected
47:08 in the eighties it's a bunch of
47:10 mathematics they are tracking if you use
47:12 ray tracing technology for those of you
47:14 don't know they have this camera and
47:16 they know the camera can see a rectangle
47:18 and they have a whole room of light
47:19 sources in it and they literally track
47:23 fictional pixels of light photons coming
47:26 out of this light at a particular rate
47:27 and they're minute letting the bounce
47:29 off the surface based on how much they
47:31 want it to look realistic they let the
47:33 photon bounce X number of times so let's
47:36 say eight bounces looks okay but 80
47:38 bounces looks absolutely perfect and it
47:41 all bounces they keep track of the ones
47:42 that bounce inside the camera they throw
47:44 away all the other pixels that will veer
47:47 off in a way that'll never come back
47:48 into the camera in video game engines we
47:51 had something called ray casting which
47:53 is that they would shoot photons out of
47:56 the camera frustum from top left to
47:58 bottom right and it was doing this 60 to
48:00 120 times per second and it was
48:02 basically finding out what that pixel
48:04 bounces into and eventually informs the
48:07 computer monitor that pixel is going to
48:09 be this color there's a hell of a lot
48:12 faster than ray tracing well your brains
48:15 doing that when you're asleep well where
48:18 is it getting all this horse power you
48:19 want to tell me that the brain is
48:21 responsible what is it it's a giant tube
48:24 when you look inside there's nothing
48:26 there hmm where's the database how do
48:31 you remember a bunch of stuff oh sure
48:33 they can open up the brain and they can
48:35 push back here on the back of the brain
48:37 and they can mess up your memories make
48:39 you get memories back supposedly they
48:41 have a pill now that'll cure Alzheimer's
48:44 probably just absorbs aluminum and pulls
48:46 it out of your brain it's probably to
48:49 memory crate by the way there's a rumor
48:52 and it was in one of the videos that was
48:53 posted on our Facebook page another
48:56 reason to get into it because there's a
48:57 lot of great information as much as
48:58 there's some funny ass memes to get up
49:00 the
49:00 and this doctor said that vitamin C is
49:04 such a cure for cancer that they're
49:06 gonna try to make it a prescription only
49:07 drug so if that should ever starts
49:11 hitting the deck you need to get out and
49:12 protest your ass off and you need to buy
49:15 that [ __ ] out of vitamin C okay a few
49:19 episodes back I stumbled onto something
49:21 that has really resonated with me since
49:25 I said it and it just all those
49:27 serendipitous things right the brain of
49:31 a giant squid or a giant octopus is
49:34 about the size of my pinky it's a tube
49:37 that's all it is right now in order to
49:40 explain the fact that these creatures
49:42 are brilliant and they can escape from
49:44 fish tanks they know how to they watch a
49:47 human being turn the door on a knob and
49:49 they will actually lift the top off of
49:51 the fish tank crawl down off the fish
49:53 tank run up to the knob and turn it and
49:56 walk the [ __ ] out of the place right
49:58 amazing
49:59 okay all with a little sausage for a
50:02 brain again a giant squid has that one
50:06 size of my pinky what do you think the
50:07 one is that's the size of like a little
50:10 bowling ball
50:12 nothing teeny tiny like a little artery
50:15 it's supposedly things so the rumor is
50:18 they're you know they're speculating at
50:20 this point that there's neurons that are
50:22 inside their arms and so they're just
50:23 trying to displace the idea that they
50:25 don't have it's really kind of a super
50:27 revealing thing about them but think
50:29 about ants ants are absolutely brilliant
50:33 aren't they man when there's like the
50:36 the floods in the the jungle and the
50:39 rainforest they build these little
50:41 bridges out of their bodies and they
50:42 know how to trap air by using the
50:45 tension of the water and so they create
50:47 these little islands and they float
50:48 clear across until they find a better
50:49 place to on higher ground to build their
50:51 nest come on folks bust a little high of
50:55 mine dudes they lay down a little trail
50:58 of of chemicals as they're looking for
51:00 food and once they find food they switch
51:02 the recipe of the chemical and they lay
51:03 that chemical all the way back following
51:05 the other trail to get back to the back
51:08 to the brood and then everyone else goes
51:10 Oh someone found food I'm smelling it
51:12 and they follow that
51:13 secondary trail right to the food and
51:16 then they lay down a secondary trail and
51:17 eventually there's this beautiful
51:18 highway of chemicals but all these
51:20 little guys use to get to the food until
51:23 the food arrives and then they continue
51:25 go out to that spot until that chemical
51:28 erodes because no one's laying down the
51:30 chemical cuz it keep going out to the
51:31 site and it's gone right I assure you
51:34 I'm just telling you my instinct is we
51:39 are a symbiotic Bing and we need to
51:41 start talking about it and everything
51:43 that we do at least in your own mind
51:47 because it is absolutely not taught in
51:50 high school it's not it's not taught in
51:53 college I mean you might get in some
51:55 really cool paranormal class that's
51:57 really into it and they're willing to go
51:59 there are some spiritual class or
52:00 something maybe you have a cool college
52:03 and they've got some Hindus it's talking
52:04 about it but we are two different things
52:07 and we make up one thing the body dies
52:10 and the soul continues for ever me a
52:15 thing is is like I remember I mean this
52:17 is gonna be undream related but kind of
52:19 related to the soul attachment thing for
52:21 a second I remember being 4 years old at
52:26 my daycare cuz I was wearing some really
52:28 cool red pants corduroy red pants let me
52:31 tell you man I was so stylin at a red
52:32 shirt red shoes I was bawling and I
52:39 remember they wanted to play games and
52:42 they wanted to stand in a circle and
52:44 seeing you know some nursery rhyme or
52:47 something and I remember having to do it
52:50 I remember the other thing too which is
52:51 Red Rover you created two lines and
52:53 you'd send someone over I don't know how
52:55 the game was played but I remember just
52:57 every single time this would happen at
52:59 4:00 I'm sitting there going this is the
53:02 this is the worst I mean this is like
53:04 corny I feel stupid doing this and what
53:07 it was is I was still an adult from my
53:11 previous life I'm sitting there going
53:13 this is great for them I mean I'm glad
53:15 they're having a good time I don't want
53:16 to crap on anyone's parade and I never
53:18 said anything I went ahead and went
53:19 through it but I just never think just
53:22 remember you know it's like when you
53:23 have that feeling that you're doing
53:25 something disgusting
53:27 that you shouldn't be doing that's the
53:29 feeling I had without really being you
53:31 know any type of like morality buster or
53:34 anything it was just the [ __ ] am i doing
53:36 here come on and that's why that song by
53:39 sparks called beat the clock when I
53:41 finally heard that 1980 I was like oh my
53:44 god
53:45 pikes 1979 actually I heard that album
53:47 and I heard that song and I read that I
53:49 heard the lyrics I was like that's me
53:50 that's me I grew up really fast I didn't
53:53 want to be a kid I want to get
53:55 everything going really really quickly
53:56 and of course I missed out on probably
53:59 some wonderful times I guess being a kid
54:01 but for me it was again being creative
54:03 right so dreams hmm what do we do with
54:08 this information well let me ask you
54:13 this question do you think it's
54:15 important that you have dreams I know
54:19 people that don't have dreams and it
54:21 really saddens me and when I find people
54:23 that don't have dreams I find them to be
54:25 extremely left-brain which breaks my
54:28 heart because some people really want to
54:30 be SuperDuper creative and they're I
54:34 will do an episode on how to be creative
54:35 I think I've done it once before in
54:38 season one I'm gonna go back and relist
54:40 into what I covered and you know
54:42 unfortunately and I'm gonna let you guys
54:45 in on something here
54:47 unfortunately I used a bunch of music
54:49 out of my catalogue for those episodes
54:52 and I don't know how the hell guys do it
54:54 where they put all this copyrighted [ __ ]
54:56 in their episodes and they don't get
54:58 copyright strikes I don't get it and
55:00 they still want pre-roll ads I used
55:03 maybe 15-20 seconds of a song and these
55:06 record companies are like I get all the
55:09 money from your episode but what happens
55:11 is you can't play it in Europe half the
55:12 damn time right so what's really sad is
55:16 there's a place I'm trying to move the
55:18 channel to create a creative mirror I
55:20 have to I've applied to be on their
55:23 channel we'll see if they let me have it
55:25 or play on their service but I'm
55:27 thinking about taking down all the
55:28 episode ones I'm gonna leave them there
55:30 but get you know I have copies there
55:33 everything backed up ten times over but
55:35 getting them all and then just finding a
55:37 piece of music that's decent and then
55:40 doing all the intro music and then
55:44 getting out there so everybody can see
55:45 everything because it's real ashame I
55:47 got great videos out there people can't
55:49 even see and people ask me about him all
55:53 the time I find it very fascinating when
55:55 I sit across from someone I know and
55:57 they I I'll say I had a great dream last
56:00 night and then they'll go oh my god me
56:02 too let me go first and I was like yeah
56:04 go go go tell me what your dream was and
56:06 we just go through it and you know
56:09 usually it doesn't take that long to go
56:10 through a dream because they're there
56:12 you know one when you wake up you
56:15 obviously forget quite a bit of the
56:16 dream unfortunately if you want to
56:19 remember your dreams the trick is simply
56:21 to grab a notebook keep one in your bed
56:23 with a pin and keep the cap on while
56:26 you're asleep and transcribe your dream
56:29 draw little diagrams if there was some
56:31 sort of invention or something write it
56:33 down and then winds up happening is that
56:35 becomes very easy again I've said in a
56:37 previous stream episode I did this at
56:39 the age of 17 and I still remember those
56:43 dreams like they happen yesterday
56:44 because I wrote them down bizarre I
56:47 think it's important that your dream
56:49 that's my personal opinion I would like
56:52 to know if anyone is suffering from not
56:54 having any dreams how detoxified are you
56:57 because some of you will be complete
57:00 homeopathic gmo-free individuals and
57:04 you're still not dreaming so let me know
57:07 if that's happening to you as well this
57:10 is a research project that we're all in
57:12 we tend to ignore things that happen
57:15 infrequently well you know that happens
57:17 every once in a while but when things
57:19 happen to us all the time
57:21 we tend to wake up and become aware of
57:23 it and then we if it's if it's harmful
57:27 to us we typically make changes to our
57:29 lives to make sure that that we cease to
57:32 become harmed by it if it's something
57:35 that's great that happens to us we tend
57:37 to reinforce it protect it feed it take
57:41 whatever measures we can to make it
57:43 happen over and over and over again and
57:45 so that's one strategy as well I have
57:48 had some really wonderful comments from
57:50 people about
57:52 my statement that I dream in real time
57:55 and people back me up on this they like
57:58 me too I have real time dreams and again
58:01 if you're brand-new to the show then I
58:02 just put the little footnote in there
58:04 it's like they tell us from dream you
58:07 know facilities at Stanford University
58:09 and many other universities that we
58:11 dream in a split second and the whole
58:12 you know you gonna have a Picard 75 year
58:15 dream and you're not you're having it in
58:18 like seven seconds or even two seconds I
58:21 don't dream like that I dream in real
58:23 time maybe that's what happens if you
58:25 detoxify maybe that's just what happens
58:27 if you're me I don't know it's it's sort
58:31 of interesting it's sort of nice I
58:33 actually honestly I might swap out for
58:36 the really quick ones as well you know
58:38 you got like it's when really when you
58:41 snooze in the morning right for those of
58:43 you are snoozers you wake up to an alarm
58:44 you hit the ten-minute nine minute delay
58:46 and you go back to bed and you end up
58:49 having a pretty elaborate dream in nine
58:51 minutes I can't say that doesn't happen
58:54 to me it does every once in a while and
58:56 that's kind of fun they're never really
58:58 that long but they do feel longer than
59:00 nine minutes right the other weird thing
59:02 about dreams just to put it in there is
59:05 that we don't typically remember that
59:08 that transition point from being
59:10 conscious to unconscious we just it
59:14 happens right we remember that we got to
59:16 sleep last night
59:17 but if I say to you well what was it
59:19 like the minute you went to sleep a
59:20 minute your your body went whoa you're
59:23 in a dream right only had it happened to
59:25 me one time in my lifetime and oddly it
59:28 looked like the the income laser from
59:32 Tron Legacy we just like this Foom of
59:36 light and then I was in the dream it was
59:38 absolutely bizarre I think that dreams
59:41 are a super exciting frontier for
59:44 mankind I don't think that we're going
59:48 to find out a lot about our dreams in
59:50 their true meaning and form by studying
59:54 the electrical patterns inside the brain
59:57 now what might be really cool and I'm
59:59 not sure this ever happens is they're
60:01 they definitely have experimented for
60:03 years trying to map the visual cortex
60:05 on the back of the brain to a monitor
60:08 all right you see this in Star Trek
60:10 episodes in the 90s and even the one in
60:12 the 21st century
60:13 enterprise well they study your dreams
60:16 and they well they study what you're
60:17 thinking when you're sitting in a chair
60:19 excuse me and it is not I don't have the
60:23 knowledge as to whether or not that
60:24 actually is supposed to be occurring
60:26 when you're dreaming wouldn't that be
60:27 wild right so you dream and you're
60:30 actually projecting it on your visual
60:31 cortex so you actually have a vision of
60:34 something I tend to think that that
60:37 doesn't occur because when you sit in
60:39 your you know the old illed example of a
60:42 kid daydreaming in school it's not like
60:45 this classroom goes away and all of a
60:46 sudden you're seeing this other world
60:48 you have a separate little projector in
60:50 your mind that is your imagination when
60:52 I talk to a few my friends recently last
60:54 month about seeing things sort of
61:00 ghostly apparitions or or things like
61:04 that nature we both agreed that when
61:06 when I saw Walt Disney at Disneyland he
61:10 was in a separate layer on top of
61:12 reality and no one else could see it
61:13 right and so that for me parses the
61:17 brain a little bit to go okay I've got
61:19 my own little mezzanine of imagination
61:21 and I've got this this other portion
61:25 that is what I'm really seeing with my
61:27 eyeballs but let's close with this one
61:29 thoughts keep this in mind I'm telling
61:34 you that my categorical belief at this
61:37 point in my life I might change my mind
61:39 but right now it's pretty solid
61:41 probably more than solid that we have a
61:45 soul and that it participates in our
61:48 every being that that's what we really
61:49 are which is why when you feel your
61:52 consciousness it's bigger than your
61:53 skull what if dreams are simply moments
62:00 when we visit our true origin our true
62:04 place and it's not some sort of heavenly
62:09 joint where you got you know peer and a
62:12 big book and angels and big walls it is
62:17 simply a place where we fell absolutely
62:19 welcomed once you get past any
62:22 nightmares you might be having again
62:24 turn into a beast that kills the Beast
62:27 you know let's say you get where your
62:28 nightmares speaking from experience boy
62:32 it'll just transform your whole life and
62:34 it's like nothing I'll hurt you
62:35 you know guys jump out of planes guys
62:37 and girls both jump out of planes and
62:39 they land safely man they feel like they
62:41 can conquer the world because Jesus they
62:42 just jumped out of a plane and they
62:44 survived right
62:45 same thing with conquering your
62:46 nightmares but once you get past that
62:49 stage and hopefully none of you are
62:50 trapped in that stage the souls that
62:53 you're bumping into I mean what is
62:55 reality I'm projecting buildings and
62:58 rooms and concerts and all kinds of
63:01 weird stuff that appeals to me because
63:02 that's what comforts me I don't need
63:05 much I don't need much at all what I
63:07 really enjoy in my dreams is hanging out
63:09 with the people and having just little
63:12 tiny conversations and everyone is
63:14 usually my dreams are a bunch of people
63:16 trying to be creative it's a strange
63:19 thing but we're not really necessarily
63:21 creating anything but we're all trying
63:23 to work together on some goal what's
63:24 really interesting I like it right but
63:28 what if it's us returning back to our
63:30 origin an abstract place that's very
63:33 comforting you build it however you want
63:36 why do I not dream of being in space
63:39 it could be just as simple as why the
63:41 hell would I want to do that floatin in
63:43 the middle of nowhere I think that'd be
63:45 really unnerving right but I do wish I
63:49 would have a spaceship dream at least
63:51 once in my lifetime I've definitely a
63:55 imagine eard you know my own brain my my
63:59 daydreaming brain those events you know
64:01 how cool would be to to be in that type
64:06 of world I think the only thing that
64:07 ever got close to the dream and you guys
64:09 are going to laugh your ass off is that
64:11 Spaceballs the movie which at first when
64:14 I saw it I wasn't really paying into the
64:17 movie and I didn't get any of its
64:18 brilliance there's the the main
64:22 Millennium Falcon I believe is an RV
64:24 that the guy drives around and I forgot
64:26 that actor's name but he flies around in
64:29 an RV with you know John Candy's
64:31 character dressed like some weird
64:33 dog character and I think I had a dream
64:37 of being in that RV I think that was the
64:39 closest thing I had to being in space
64:40 but I often wonder why there's
64:42 toxification of the human mind right on
64:47 a political level in the world level
64:49 well it's just to be docile to have no
64:52 resources to fight back
64:54 wise vegetarianism pushed to make you
64:57 docile to give you no energy now maybe
65:00 some people are already too agro anyway
65:02 and they should probably go vegetarian
65:04 just to relax a little bit but for a lot
65:06 of people you know they tend to be they
65:08 sent that tend to be fairly complicit
65:10 right now again there's always
65:13 exceptions to the rule we have a few
65:14 listeners who have let me know that
65:16 they're vegetarians some of let me know
65:18 I don't think I'm not healthy I think I
65:19 might start eating meat just experiment
65:21 with it again if you're comfortable with
65:25 your life [ __ ] everything I'm saying or
65:27 hey I mean seriously nor everything that
65:29 I say if you're comfortable with your
65:31 life right hopefully that doesn't mean
65:34 truth falls out of your camp but if
65:36 you're watching me this late in the
65:37 video I tend to think that you're a part
65:40 of that game the Great Awakening right I
65:42 feel very balanced every day of my life
65:45 and I don't get everything I want in
65:47 life right but I feel fairly balanced in
65:50 life because I dream well when I'm awake
65:54 I feel like well I just had a little
65:55 vacation I definitely would rather be on
65:57 you know Waikiki Beach for about 10 to
66:01 15 days but if I got to work and I got
66:05 to do what I got to do to survive I feel
66:08 comfortable I want that for everyone I
66:10 want you to be in your skin and I want
66:12 you to feel awesome right I want you to
66:16 have so many options that it's like
66:18 standing in front of your favorite
66:20 vending machine in life and you're like
66:21 oh my god I love every single candy bar
66:24 but it only got money for one so I gotta
66:26 fix something to roll with it right but
66:29 next week I'm gonna have enough money by
66:30 differently right now there is a curse I
66:34 will definitely tell you this is off
66:35 subject but it's definitely tell you in
66:37 closing you're the greatest curse and
66:39 the world that I have found is being
66:41 interested in everything I've said this
66:42 a couple times so I want to say it again
66:44 I think that we do have to make choices
66:47 in life because we have a finite amount
66:49 of years that we can live you got to
66:51 plan things right maybe for this
66:53 five-year or ten-year period you're
66:55 gonna jump into one thing and then if
66:56 that doesn't work out you got the plan B
66:58 right you've listed everything in your
67:00 life that you want to experience one to
67:02 ten in accordance of importance one
67:04 being the top and 10 being the least
67:06 important and then just go down your
67:08 list maybe you can do a few of them at
67:10 the same time but I think that when you
67:13 stop and think just silence everything
67:15 else in your life if dreams are
67:17 interesting you're listening to this
67:18 episode and you're into it for over an
67:20 hour right so something that's
67:21 interesting to you so think about it
67:25 again one of you is going to have the
67:29 Epiphany that we're all looking for I'm
67:32 looking for what's in your brain you're
67:34 gonna make a decision and you're gonna
67:36 have this logical connection between
67:38 things hopefully the information I'm
67:40 giving you gives you a foundation if you
67:42 don't have one for you to get to that
67:44 answer and then please do your god share
67:46 it with all of us right I'll make it
67:49 episode about whatever your epiphany is
67:51 about dreams I think that it is I don't
67:56 know I mean when I think about these
67:57 answers I think well as the answer are
67:59 going to be complicated or is it going
68:01 to be simple is it going to be matter of
68:03 fact I tend to really gravitate away
68:05 from matter matter of fact observations
68:07 of the universe well it's just this you
68:11 know I hate those answers maybe it's
68:13 true should I don't know maybe I'm just
68:15 being difficult right I think that when
68:18 we do hear the right combination of
68:22 cause and effect as to why dreams occur
68:25 we're all gonna have that aha oh yeah
68:30 why the hell didn't I think about that
68:32 it was right in front of my face the
68:34 entire time right sort of my personal
68:38 belief about ether solving for all mass
68:40 and energy in this existence it is the
68:43 most perfect thing and it shows up
68:45 everywhere now right we want an answer
68:49 something like that right anyway I
68:52 appreciate you guys making it this far
68:54 hope you feel me on this one
68:56 if you have been to deep thoughts
68:58 radio.com that's where all the episodes
69:00 exists obviously if you just join
69:02 YouTube it's all in there too but if you
69:05 guys like podcasting in your car or when
69:07 you're just trying to go to bed at night
69:09 that's a great place to go to for those
69:11 of you who have bandwidth issues too I
69:12 want to make sure you guys understand
69:14 that a video depending on the resolution
69:16 it's coming down and whether or not you
69:17 connect your device to your local router
69:19 in your house which hopefully everyone's
69:21 doing that because it removes you using
69:24 your bandwidth on your phone I find
69:26 people all the time sucking movies down
69:29 to their phones through their backbone
69:31 on their cellular network and even if
69:33 you might have an unlimited plan they
69:35 start ganking your bandwidth it's nuts
69:37 so get on your router and then get it
69:38 all for free and get it I res right but
69:41 for those of you who have to pull it
69:42 into your car
69:44 download get a podcast or download it
69:46 into your device while you're at home
69:48 and then take it with you in your car so
69:50 you're not streaming anything down an
69:52 episode and a and they just so you know
69:54 the numbers okay I upload about a 16 gig
69:58 4k file it's about twelve to sixteen
70:02 depending it was an hour and hour and a
70:03 half but when I download it back it's
70:07 usually about four gig to one gig
70:09 depending on what kind of bandwidth it
70:11 has some of the episodes are not getting
70:13 encoded to 4k even though I uploaded
70:15 it's still at 360 there's one like that
70:17 it's just it's the vacuum one pisses me
70:20 off because I got like a lot of great
70:21 comments I don't want to blow away so
70:23 I'm leaving that 360p piece of crap up
70:26 there when it's really in 4k so if I can
70:30 get on a different service what I'll end
70:32 up doing is probably taking the website
70:34 and converting it to all those URLs when
70:35 vid me existed
70:37 I had converted all of the first
70:39 episodes with those soundtracks to feed
70:42 me URLs which you could hear the music
70:44 and everybody could hear it but you had
70:46 to go the website deep thoughts radio
70:49 calm to get the access to it or you had
70:51 to subscribe to me on vid me we've had
70:53 dub me of course went out of business
70:54 because it was offering a great place to
70:58 be but there's also a locked Facebook
71:02 group again I'm just gonna do long
71:04 bumper this particular time the lock
71:06 Facebook group is a great place to go
71:08 for fun
71:10 see talk again everyone is so cordial I
71:13 you know I personally want to thank
71:15 everyone on the Facebook group every
71:17 single one of you because I see
71:20 disagreements and I see everybody being
71:22 so friendly about those disagreements
71:23 and just please keep that energy at the
71:26 Facebook group and again we really only
71:29 have one rule with all the social media
71:31 there's a Twitter page up there too and
71:33 there's a patreon page up there if
71:37 someone just starts getting like
71:38 Tourette's of the mouth right you know
71:40 just diarrhea of the mouth and you're in
71:43 the persons commenting and just being
71:45 like erudition Duke that's fine but if
71:49 they continue to post and become a
71:52 nuisance with nothing more than
71:53 name-calling well what do what are the
71:55 shells do what is the flack when you get
71:58 over the target it's all this
71:59 name-calling trying to make everyone
72:01 else on the channel feel alienated by
72:03 paying attention to things that make you
72:05 think those people get wiped off the map
72:07 okay so again if you want to get deeper
72:13 into this get a little few more
72:14 notifications but again the Facebook
72:16 group you have to understand it doesn't
72:18 revolve around the show you know I'll
72:20 post hey here's the latest episode guys
72:22 I don't do all of them if I do a
72:24 doubleheader and I don't think anyone
72:26 cares about one of them I won't post it
72:27 out there but if you if you get into the
72:32 Facebook group it's about everything
72:33 else that's going on in society right
72:35 sometimes there's a couple political
72:37 post we usually don't get that political
72:38 but it's just a really cool place you
72:41 know again and we all know that the deep
72:43 State and the five eyes look at us when
72:44 we get into social media
72:45 good luck interacting with the universe
72:47 if you want to get rid of that in your
72:48 life again hopefully q and on is very
72:51 real by the way is posting again and all
72:53 this will be reset for us but we're
72:56 gonna have to be vigilant okay we have
72:58 to start putting these fake news
73:00 organizations out of business by never
73:02 ever watching them and make sure that in
73:06 our personal lives we pass on how crappy
73:08 the information is right people have
73:10 been misled into hating people and their
73:12 families and friends circles right
73:14 anyway take care of yourself and someone
73:17 else and hopefully I'll see you on a
73:18 much warmer brighter day over now
73:21 [Music]
73:37 in a recent listener asked me D have you
73:42 ever done a dream but look goddamn
73:45 blooper for you buddy
