00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:32 defense on this cold rainy night you
00:36 stopped raining for now I've got
00:40 everything insulated in case it does
00:42 start raining on me I can't least handle
00:44 quite a bit of rain at this point those
00:49 of you are devout listeners you'll know
00:51 that we've weathered a few storms
00:53 together so today I had a request that I
00:59 thought was pretty damn good which is a
01:01 request to discuss directed-energy
01:02 weapons specifically as opposed to
01:04 embedding them in other episodes and
01:10 it's a really weird like journey for me
01:13 personally and my camera looks like et
01:17 with a little blanket over its head
01:21 which I just watched this Xfinity reboot
01:26 of et with the Harry Henry Thomas
01:29 character who played Elliot it's kind of
01:35 a an IKE as amazing as the movie but
01:39 they built a like a muppet of this thing
01:43 and or a puppet or where I want to call
01:46 it and it was pretty endearing for those
01:48 of you've seen the first film
01:51 alright so directed energy weapons
01:55 immediately this is demonetised course
01:57 because I support weapons in it it's
01:59 really where they get you if I just say
02:03 DW then no one will find the episode in
02:07 general so I'm surfing the web I don't
02:12 know 10 years ago and this woman dr.
02:16 Judy woods is giving this lecture I look
02:20 at the timestamp on this thing it's like
02:22 I don't know it was like 3 hours and 40
02:25 minutes or something like that which
02:27 made me like automatically cringe but it
02:29 says you know something to the effect of
02:33 director to energy weapons exist this
02:35 presentation by Judy woods gonna prove
02:37 it to you
02:38 and I'm like oh God you know we know
02:43 that these weapons well I should say
02:46 this my journey of it like is like this
02:49 when the game from Westwood Studios came
02:51 out called command & Conquer there was
02:55 something called the ion cannon it's a
02:56 fictional game of course and you wanted
02:59 to build this thing fairly quickly
03:00 because it would zap the crap out of the
03:02 ground it was like a nuke without any
03:04 nuclear radiation it just destroyed the
03:07 building that you were in of course if
03:09 you were in it it would I guess
03:11 theoretically following your head or
03:13 something like that so that was it and
03:16 you know explained that it was using the
03:19 electrons from generally the Van Allen
03:22 belts but didn't say Van Allen belts
03:25 which again are made of electrons
03:28 look there's electrons everywhere it's
03:30 just II throw matter spending in a
03:31 particular way they can charge a wire
03:35 that's conductive any surfaces
03:37 conductive and you can gather and coil
03:39 and store depending on what mechanism
03:41 you're using the power and because we
03:46 know how to direct energy in a laser we
03:50 can create all forms of laser all forms
03:53 of projected energy cyclones and columns
03:57 and beam a bunch of energy at you many
04:02 of you know about this stuff with the
04:03 microwave sort of crowd control weapons
04:06 that they've discussed using I don't
04:08 know if they've ever used them in public
04:09 probably in China where the value of
04:13 life inland is marginal but the day
04:18 after or that I should say the week
04:19 after 9/11 we can say because we're
04:22 gonna Deamonte eyes this one time at
04:25 Roosevelt was asked by I believe a a
04:27 British female whether or not they
04:31 thought the Pentagon thought the
04:35 directed-energy weapons were being used
04:37 against the World Trade Centers to bring
04:39 them down because despite with the you
04:43 know six media companies that control
04:46 the world again it would strange about
04:47 that as I tracked it to four because one
04:50 bought one and
04:51 at 5:00 and then one bought the other
04:53 and then it was consolidated - for
04:55 whatever four to six companies they're
04:57 not telling you about these options
05:02 they're not telling you that physics was
05:05 absolutely negated the day of 9/11 in
05:07 terms of the what you saw and what you
05:11 were told happened now of course there's
05:14 a billion things about 9/11 that are
05:16 crazy you know the guy on scene with the
05:18 brown hair who was like the head anchor
05:21 at the time stopped when the second
05:23 plane hit the World Trade Center and he
05:26 said oh my god it looks like the nose
05:28 cone came out the other side and so you
05:31 have a plane that supposedly penetrates
05:32 this building made of aluminum going
05:36 through a concrete barrier that's 50% of
05:38 the interior of the building reinforced
05:40 with 49 box girder beams which trust me
05:44 you could fly in a plane directly out of
05:46 box girder beam you might get it to
05:48 vibrate it's so huge and so strong but
05:52 the nosecone because the special effects
05:54 team that was creating these shots for
05:55 you blew it it came it comes out the
05:59 other side of the building and then
06:00 sucks back in typically that's a
06:03 waypoint in 3d software which gained a
06:08 Bezier curve when they wanted to be a
06:10 straight point-to-point movement and so
06:13 it's going from point A to point B but
06:16 it has a bit of an elliptical orbit to
06:18 get to the final destination so it goes
06:21 out way further than it should for those
06:24 of you have driven drawn in Illustrator
06:26 you know all about this so we have a
06:28 hospital about a block away and so
06:32 sometimes it's the ambulance but when it
06:33 hauls ass it's a cop car but anyway when
06:36 you draw an illustrator you'll know when
06:37 you're connecting two points with the
06:39 curve to a line tool you get these wild
06:42 Bezier curves that's most likely what
06:45 happened in whatever software they were
06:46 using now the reason why they had to do
06:49 it live I think has to do with the fact
06:51 that the shots were coming in that day
06:53 and they didn't know where exactly the
06:54 cameras were gonna be down to the pixels
06:55 so they had to pull things off shoot
06:58 some some plates and then bring them in
07:01 and then
07:03 when they played them back to you you
07:06 believe that the airplane was or the
07:08 plane taking the shot especially the
07:10 airplane coming in was at that moment at
07:12 live in time but you don't really know
07:14 but anyway I think most people on the in
07:17 who know about building demolition even
07:20 Donald Trump came out the day of and
07:22 said it looked like you know someone had
07:25 demolished the buildings physically with
07:26 explosives the firefighter said you know
07:30 there are all kinds of secondary
07:31 explosions and when it fell it was both
07:35 of them they you know her pop pop pop
07:37 pop pop pop all the way down the
07:39 building sevens astray of demolition
07:40 anyone who's ever seen a building
07:41 demolished with demolition
07:44 you know the controlled demolition
07:47 family or many of the families out there
07:49 just open your eyes come one they blow
07:51 the center column the the windows
07:54 actually explode from the bottom up then
07:56 the center column pops and then poof
07:59 into a beautiful pile whoever blew these
08:02 buildings up seriously a for the day
08:04 unfortunately it's attached to a
08:06 conspiracy so where does directed-energy
08:09 weapons come in well when you presents a
08:15 story to the masses the defies physics
08:18 that defies engineering that defines
08:20 metallurgy the problem is is that the
08:24 masses don't know anything about it it's
08:25 just like unexplained science they get
08:27 to lie to you about every you know where
08:29 they mitigated things going to the moon
08:30 but when you show it to the entire world
08:32 and you say this is the pretext for us
08:34 going to war this is the pretense of why
08:36 everyone in the room feels horrible and
08:39 feels terrifying as well as dr. Steven
08:42 Jones another PhD in Brigham Young
08:45 University and tons and tons of other
08:47 engineers and architects for 9/11 truth
08:50 which I their numbers are staggering I
08:53 mean they have over I believe 3,600 PhDs
08:56 and almost 10,000 master's degrees all
09:00 going in and saying look this is
09:02 physically impossible what you said
09:04 occurred is physically impossible I
09:07 don't think I'm gonna get into like why
09:10 all this happened today
09:13 yeah you saw what happened afterwards
09:15 right go reads ignorance in Chuukese
09:16 book the grand chessboard it'll explain
09:18 everything to you 1987 go read the
09:22 neocon paper with Cheney calling for a
09:25 Newport Harbor
09:25 I believe in 92 or something with Donald
09:29 Rumsfeld inside the document and
09:30 Kissinger is in the document I mean
09:32 seriously they had this plan for ages
09:35 but Judy made this video and I love her
09:40 to death I would give her a massive hug
09:42 I probably give her a mouth kiss if she
09:44 wanted one but she's a genius when I
09:49 watched this video I started off going
09:51 at you know like oh my god come on
09:53 really you know like I believe things
09:55 happened but I was sure it was all
09:58 thermate explosives the sulfur ice
10:03 military version of thermite I'm sure
10:06 you know dr. Steven Jones he proved it
10:13 we'll get into him if I can remember
10:15 after we go down this huge long path now
10:22 Judy she's a little dry right she's not
10:27 there to entertain she's there to
10:28 educate so if you're looking for you
10:32 know a Steve Jobs presentation or
10:34 something elaborate it's not going to be
10:37 there but it's sourced it's sourced in
10:40 science now judy has committed herself
10:44 to a ton of things because the day of
10:47 9/11 woke her up so hardcore that all
10:51 these conspiracy theories that were
10:52 bouncing around and people criticizing
10:54 people who believed in them gained her
10:56 attention and she's like okay let's talk
10:59 about this she got into chemtrails
11:02 hardcore just got into HAARP she was the
11:06 one that taught me about something
11:07 called infrasonic undulation which has
11:09 to do with the HAARP antenna or similar
11:11 devices somewhere else in the world
11:14 modulating clouds modulating and
11:16 potentially spreading out Kim trills you
11:20 know we always wonder why barium oxide
11:22 is inside chemtrails nano-sized barium
11:24 oxide nano sized aluminum box
11:26 most potentially the case is that when
11:29 they're spraying this stuff barium can't
11:31 electrically we could take the
11:35 atmosphere and make it conductive and so
11:38 if you want to spray something and have
11:40 it spread out you spray a line but you
11:43 hit it with the HAARP object you know
11:45 some type of HAARP antenna which could
11:46 be mounted on a plane that's further up
11:49 and it essentially vibrates and spreads
11:53 with this infrasonic undulation the the
11:56 chemtrail out like a fillet of fish
11:58 you're just literally looking at the
12:00 scale of a fish you know like the spine
12:01 and then the fillet of it right that's a
12:05 different story so what is the theory
12:08 behind directed-energy weapons it's
12:11 actually remarkably simple theory I can
12:16 only assume that the engineering to
12:17 create such a weapon is seriously a
12:22 brilliant weapon with probably
12:26 tremendous amounts of engineering and
12:28 testing and what-have-you so whoever put
12:30 these things together is most likely you
12:32 know certifiably genius level human
12:36 beings this is one of those reasons why
12:38 I don't want folks to completely blow
12:42 off some form of satellite a lot of
12:45 people like satellites don't exist man
12:46 okay if you believe that the problem is
12:50 is you make yourself susceptible to them
12:52 if they exist imagine people telling you
12:54 that the world is flat such that they
12:57 don't have to and then you erase space
12:59 you raise gravity and you raise
13:00 satellites and so you think you're safe
13:03 when you're not and so what ends up
13:05 happening is they infect your brain to
13:07 ignore the Keiser so say the devil
13:10 that's above you doing all kinds of
13:12 crazy [ __ ] - well I don't know why we
13:13 all turned into zombies gee I don't know
13:15 because there can't be anything up there
13:17 because you've adopted a theory of the
13:18 world that won't anything be up there
13:20 but there's a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] up there
13:21 [ __ ] everything up so it's important
13:25 not to go too deep and lose your mind
13:29 your theory is this obviously even in my
13:34 ether model the universe there are
13:36 forces that hold various materials
13:37 together at various strengths
13:39 steel has a certain density and strength
13:41 meaning more you know more dense
13:44 something is in my world there are more
13:46 finite currents per capita of space and
13:50 so gold is a lot heavier than say
13:54 aluminum okay well those are currents of
13:57 energy of ether oil particles you can go
14:02 up to whatever model of the universe and
14:04 physics you want and it's still the same
14:05 thing now if you could get in there and
14:10 mess with the currents will hold this
14:12 thing together
14:14 looks like I'm smoking but it's 46
14:16 degrees out here so I see my breath
14:19 trippy show must go on baby so this geo
14:29 centric satellite is straight above you
14:33 straight above whatever they're trying
14:34 to kneel could be planes but the
14:38 evidence that Judy presented makes it
14:40 look like it was straight overhead but
14:43 she gets into all this evidence and
14:45 relating to 911 especially towers that
14:50 disintegrated upon falling so would you
14:53 see when you saw to 110 story gigantic
14:57 skyscrapers fall was pretty amazing for
15:01 the first three seconds of the six and a
15:04 half seconds they took to fall roughly
15:06 again we're talking about stuff falling
15:08 the freefall never ever gonna happen in
15:11 a structural fire all these buildings
15:14 that are burned in England burned in
15:16 Dubai burned over there all over the
15:19 world right towering inferno was a movie
15:21 when I saw when I was a kid it was a
15:23 building that was legitimately on fire
15:25 based on some other fires we had in the
15:26 70s and they didn't just fall down okay
15:30 well these were hit by planes mm-hmm to
15:35 recap the World Trade Center designs
15:36 they were designed to be hit by five
15:38 fully loaded fully fueled 737s you might
15:42 say but do you know I think there were
15:43 757 that hit the World Trade Centers
15:45 okay there's a 70 pound difference
15:47 between the two however the 757s were
15:49 not remotely fully loaded so they were
15:51 probably
15:52 ashlee several hundred pounds lighter
15:54 than if what it was designed to be hit
15:58 by but this is five 737s would have to
16:03 collide into the same hole at the same
16:05 area of the building before there was
16:06 any structural damage that would cause
16:09 it to collapse like a tree you know boom
16:12 fall over and that top part is always
16:14 gonna hit the ground let me have to
16:16 remember now if you look at pictures of
16:18 the World Trade Centers as a little bit
16:22 of rain comes on me I make sure Mike
16:24 appear completely covered here the two
16:28 World Trade Centers have these lighter
16:29 bands in them about third up and
16:32 two-thirds of them the reason why those
16:34 bands exist is their impact floors
16:36 they're specifically designed to take
16:41 the take the blunt-force of the previous
16:43 floors that might fall so the first
16:47 third can only fall to that first band
16:49 the two-thirds up this two-thirds can
16:52 fall to that second the first band a
16:54 third up and things not going to
16:56 completely collapse to the ground now
16:58 they use those is also maintenance
16:59 floors because you there's so much
17:01 reinforcement on those floors you can't
17:05 put apartments in there you can't put
17:06 buildings in there so they stored all of
17:08 their laundry equipment and whatever
17:12 okay so sometimes it gets deprecated oh
17:15 no those aren't those those Armenians
17:16 force their maintenance floors because
17:17 they can't put anything else because
17:19 it's so reinforced a couple things you
17:22 need to understand when fema released
17:25 the blueprints of the World Trade
17:26 Centers the inner box girder beams were
17:30 erased for the blueprint
17:33 oh and without that you don't have a
17:36 building that would stand up in the
17:37 first place
17:38 suppose that had reinforced concrete
17:41 interior in 50% of the floor plan is
17:43 this interior that's how they were able
17:46 to build the building with the outer
17:47 structure being a big part of what held
17:50 it up and it you know barely got injured
17:53 from these plane sitting I mean
17:54 seriously you've got easily on four
17:58 sides you might have on any one
18:01 particular structural connection you've
18:03 probably got 80 70 80 percent of the
18:06 outer
18:06 a structure completely intact which is
18:08 way more than it needs to stay together
18:11 now I am a no planner I don't believe
18:15 any planes at the World Trade Center for
18:17 those of you who've never heard that
18:18 theory before the problem is and all the
18:22 footage of the planes if you really
18:24 really SuperDuper pay attention they've
18:26 made a bunch of special effects errors
18:28 you should go look them up this is using
18:30 footage from all the news stations so
18:33 it's not someone else creating this and
18:37 you know like someone see giing it
18:40 together this is like Fox News ABC NBC
18:42 everyone who covered it right
18:44 we took their footage and rolled it back
18:46 and went whoa one of the planes flew
18:50 behind a in front of a building that was
18:52 in the background one flew behind a
18:54 building that was in the foreground
18:58 oopsy you see the dimensions of the
19:01 planes actually changed prior to
19:02 impacting the towers you see in one
19:07 footage it looks like almost the the
19:10 turbine disappears because this the hole
19:14 they made in the side of the world
19:16 trainer wasn't a World Trade Center
19:18 number one which was hit second wasn't
19:22 big enough for the plane so they just
19:23 it's amazing what they did I mean you
19:26 know was it was a hell of a scam right
19:29 unfortunately people died that's the
19:33 problem people jumped people were blown
19:35 out of windows because their explosives
19:37 going off inside were literally throwing
19:39 people out of any resistance hole or a
19:42 lack of resistance hole firefighters
19:44 died when these things hit I mean it's a
19:46 horrific situation people this is not
19:48 one of these situations where were
19:49 claiming that everybody survived nothing
19:51 happened Hey oh no I can only hope that
19:55 some of the faces they put up downstairs
19:58 were fake but I don't think they were so
20:01 please don't think I'm saying that so
20:04 when you saw the very first building
20:06 fall which was a real Trade Center too
20:10 no one that was hit second right what
20:14 did you see
20:14 you saw this collapse start to happen
20:18 now the fireball which everyone saw for
20:22 the second impact was much bigger in
20:23 everyone's psychological mind so what
20:25 did you actually see if there were no
20:26 planes but you see a bunch of
20:28 detonations and you see on TV the plane
20:33 hitting around the same exact time so
20:35 I've actually had friends of mine that
20:36 said I saw the planes hit the World
20:38 Trade Center I said okay where did you
20:39 see it where were you standing and they
20:41 all said one form or another on TV I was
20:45 downstairs at a restaurant but the World
20:47 Trade Center was right outside I heard a
20:49 plane scream across and I looked up and
20:53 then there was the explosion but not the
20:54 actual impact everyone who called in
20:57 that day
20:57 we're like producers and cameraman can
21:02 they get all these people in on the
21:03 conspiracy yeah they can because it
21:07 wasn't that many but let's say there
21:10 were planes it doesn't really matter but
21:11 when that first chunk which is about
21:15 what 40% of the second tower that was it
21:18 starts to tip over you see it it's
21:21 tipping there's a giant portion he's 110
21:25 stories take 40% of that it's at least
21:26 42 stories it's starting to tip over but
21:30 it's also starting to go down
21:32 and it's you know crushing supposedly
21:34 this Discovery Channel Purdue University
21:37 pancake theory which would have left
21:39 about 3035 floors compacted at the
21:42 bottom that was some what you saw you
21:45 saw to the out erectus skeleton you know
21:48 in the ground it was a bunch of debris
21:52 but it ain't 30 stories but the problem
21:56 is is that at no point in me dropping
22:00 this cigar right now to hit the ground
22:02 is it gonna vaporize before it it's the
22:05 ground and that's what happened to that
22:07 top section that top section should hit
22:10 the ground undisturbed because that's
22:12 what happens right you knock the milk
22:14 off the table on accident
22:16 what is the does the milk glass and the
22:19 milk vaporized every once in a while
22:21 no it hits the ground
22:24 but that never happened what do you
22:26 think would happen if 42 stories are
22:28 dropped on your neighborhood just out of
22:31 thin air and it starts up like 60
22:33 stories up there could be a big hole in
22:37 the ground a gigantic hole in the ground
22:39 I think the amount of casualties on the
22:41 ground would have been tension
22:44 potentially 10 times as much right the
22:47 day was heavily orchestrated and we know
22:50 this because there were some Jewish kids
22:51 filming it across the Hudson River
22:53 dancing on top of a van they have
22:56 admitted this on their little version of
22:58 MTV over there in Israel when asked what
23:00 were you doing there they said we we
23:02 didn't have anything to do with it
23:04 we were simply told to document it live
23:07 television go looking up look up Israeli
23:10 dancers 911 they detained the kids and
23:15 the State Department's a phone call and
23:17 says you let these kids go there's a
23:19 empty van it tests positive for all
23:22 kinds of explosives but it's empty when
23:25 they went back to the company that owned
23:27 the van
23:27 the owner of the company was already
23:30 trying to get out of New York and get to
23:33 Israel I mean you know I'm not trying to
23:35 blame one group maybe they were just
23:36 watching who the hell knows right
23:37 everyone's responsible especially United
23:40 States government but there's Judy woods
23:42 directed-energy weapons I'm setting this
23:45 up so you understand if I just tell you
23:48 directed-energy weapons
23:49 you might just roll your eyes so I'm
23:53 giving you the things that were
23:54 impossible that day the building's
23:57 atomized into pyroclastic clouds which
24:01 is why there were so many giant you know
24:03 so many gigantic clouds going down all
24:05 the streets while everyone died a black
24:07 lung we tried to clean the place up plus
24:09 the buildings were full of asbestos
24:10 think about atomizing all this precious
24:14 metal and wild plastics and stuff and
24:16 you're believing it I mean you're
24:18 breathing excuse me you're believing the
24:21 Red Cross who told you it was safe a
24:24 bunch of gold was being stolen out of
24:26 the basement of the World Trade Centers
24:28 it was eventually recovered and that's
24:32 when the cleanup stopped but they hadn't
24:35 finished cleaning up everything
24:37 especially the body parts of survivors
24:41 it's a bad day man
24:43 bad day United States military at some
24:48 corrupt level was definitely involved
24:50 because NORAD stood down
24:51 Dick Cheney made sure that whatever was
24:54 coming at the Pentagon hit the Pentagon
24:55 a missile with wings is first reported
24:57 and most likely as either percent true
25:00 building 7 was the headquarters of the
25:02 entire operation with Giuliani's sort of
25:06 terror response floor being I think the
25:09 top floor but it was just recently
25:11 reinforced with the millions of dollars
25:13 to make sure it was safe for him but he
25:15 knew that he knew the place was going to
25:17 be blown up because the operation is
25:19 being it's a perfect place to sit
25:21 because you can see the two towers from
25:23 it so you can orchestrate everything get
25:26 all your stuff together and then you
25:27 blow up your your headquarters I went to
25:31 New York in December of 2007 for New
25:35 Year's and building 7 had been
25:37 completely rebuilt and had never hit the
25:39 airwaves that had been rebuilt then what
25:42 should focus on that building supposedly
25:45 plane crashed in a field in a farmer's
25:49 field in Shanksville now something went
25:53 down supposedly eight miles away and it
25:54 left a gigantic field of debris we'd
25:58 never seen that ever on film that I know
26:00 of but the farmer recently just came out
26:02 and said you know that slit in the
26:03 ground where they told you the plane
26:04 windy because I dug that two years
26:06 before the event occurred you never saw
26:09 any bodies you never saw any plane parts
26:12 the biggest lie in history okay great
26:16 but the principle of a directed-energy
26:18 weapon is that you can hit the metal of
26:20 a certain type which is all have being
26:23 held together by chemistry by nuclear
26:27 bonds that hold things together the
26:30 plastic is different than the metal if
26:33 they're different grades of metal
26:35 different grades of density well and
26:36 that's going to potentially force you to
26:39 use different frequencies to hold these
26:41 things together a gold bar is going to
26:43 hold together different than aluminum so
26:47 what you do is you create a very
26:49 powerful and
26:51 invisible beam of electricity can't see
26:56 a laser in broad daylight you got to
26:58 blow some smoke that's when you see it
26:59 right but you have this beam come down
27:03 from this device from space using
27:06 infinite power from space and you start
27:12 doing cookie cutters from space how big
27:16 and how these things operate I don't
27:18 know but there are cookie cutters on the
27:21 ground that Judy pointed out in her
27:22 presentation what do I mean by that well
27:25 9/11 is over and NASA had done some
27:28 pictures to complete the shock and awe
27:30 package for the American people in the
27:32 rest of the world showing the whole area
27:34 from space it was a shot that 20 years
27:38 ago was very easy to find her you know
27:40 whatever 18 years ago very easy to find
27:42 it because you were meant to find it
27:43 you're meant to be traumatized by it but
27:46 when Judy was looked at the photograph
27:49 and said oh wow look how these cookie
27:51 cutters all over the ground that are
27:54 perfect circles all over the ground
27:57 those are residual little pings from
28:00 whatever did this in space and the one
28:02 that most likely hit the World Trade
28:03 Centers was a lot bigger so I get in
28:07 this thing and watching this
28:08 presentation and I bring up the photo
28:12 I'm not using her because she doctored
28:14 hers right these are from like nasa.gov
28:18 reckon the day and she's absolutely
28:21 right there's all these cookie cutters
28:24 from above so you might go okay what do
28:29 you mean by cookie cutter cuz I kind of
28:31 understand kind of don't understand well
28:33 imagine my house here from something
28:37 happens to it a bunch of it gets
28:39 destroyed but there's no fire
28:40 necessarily just a bunch of it vanishes
28:43 and in its place it's a pyroclastic
28:45 cloud or at least a pile of ash of what
28:48 was in this cylinder it's missing from
28:54 my house a cylinder like a cookie color
28:56 just comes straight down from space and
28:59 atomizes anything it hits of a
29:02 particular material
29:04 like the fires in Paradise California
29:06 like I mentioned in my California fires
29:07 episode you have engine blocks melting
29:09 out but plastic pieces not melted out
29:14 this happened first at 9/11 in 9/11
29:17 there's all kinds of cars parked all
29:19 around this event and because that
29:24 frequency was so massive at times parts
29:27 of cars or melted away coinciding with
29:31 the parts that needed to melt away
29:32 inside the Trade Center now the Trade
29:36 Center is also made of concrete which is
29:38 very difficult I would imagine to melt
29:40 away because concrete is a natural
29:42 insulator against all radiation of any
29:45 kind so what would you use to get rid of
29:48 the concrete thermite / thermate
29:52 thermite thermate is the form I've seen
29:55 it in is it's like a little um looks
29:58 like cocoa puffs we round and it feels
30:01 like it feels just like you know like a
30:04 cocoa puff some inert material it just
30:08 dries and it's like a little thing but
30:11 when you make sulfur with it the
30:14 temperature at which thermite burns goes
30:17 up considerably me and you light this
30:20 stuff with the few so you could light it
30:21 with the match and all of a sudden you
30:24 have 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit - like
30:27 4,200 degrees Fahrenheit instantaneously
30:29 it will melt steel and it will melt
30:31 concrete well you should probably also
30:34 trigger the trust's the little
30:37 connection points around every floor to
30:40 make the floor attached to the outer
30:42 skeleton and the inner center column
30:45 yeah well there's a bunch of [ __ ]
30:48 going on right there was construction on
30:51 both towers there's a Martin Bush was
30:54 running security for six months
30:56 companies were forced to move floors in
30:58 the middle of like no no notification at
31:00 all
31:01 you got to go the second floor with the
31:02 floor up from you're the one we just did
31:04 what I'm running a whole company here
31:06 right who's gonna pay for this right so
31:11 we probably have thermate the
31:13 military-grade of thermite we have
31:15 explosives at all the Trust's
31:17 and we have directed-energy weapons to
31:20 finish it off from space to make sure
31:22 that whatever doesn't melt from space is
31:24 blown the [ __ ] up you have AI beams that
31:28 are massive that flew across the street
31:30 and embedded inside buildings all right
31:33 ones last time you drop something
31:36 straight and it flew it doesn't fly
31:40 unless there's force basic physics right
31:44 every reaction has an equal and opposite
31:47 reaction what do those towers look like
31:49 when they fell they call a flower down
31:52 right they blew out all four walls blew
31:55 out it just looked like a look like a
31:57 building being turned inside out force
32:02 explosions okay plus now you have things
32:08 cut down to size by explosives by
32:12 thermite thermate and now you may not
32:15 have to assist in the process of
32:19 atomizing it from space this beam is
32:23 constructed to do one thing wiggle apart
32:26 all of the atoms in a particular
32:29 material now they could have done it for
32:32 steel aluminum I don't know if they can
32:35 do plastics I don't know if they could
32:36 do woods I don't know it seemed like
32:38 wood would be almost impossible it
32:39 wouldn't react but you know who knows
32:42 but everything's getting turned into
32:43 clouds by the time it hits the ground
32:45 that tipping piece never hit the ground
32:47 in a full constructed piece when the
32:51 second tower fell there's a beautiful
32:53 shot of the communications tower on top
32:56 it falls for a few feet and then you see
33:00 it atomize and just blow away
33:03 unbelievable right in your face man now
33:07 of course people can insinuate that it
33:10 fell so quickly that only thing that you
33:12 saw was like the dust blowing off of it
33:14 but come on
33:15 really you got a big antenna it's been
33:18 up there and no one's been up there to
33:19 necessarily dust it off what's going to
33:21 cause it to create a ghostly imprint of
33:23 it just literally blowing to the side
33:25 and it's on an HD camera so you're
33:29 talking about some crappy cell phone
33:30 camera or
33:31 jittering helicopter footage someone is
33:33 somewhere in New York with a really nice
33:34 camera filming this and it falls and you
33:37 see it and then it doesn't exist anymore
33:40 hmm
33:42 so do directed-energy weapons exist well
33:48 Donald Rumsfeld was asked by that woman
33:50 he says his response to her say do you
33:55 think that the enemy Hughes directed
33:57 energy weapons like [ __ ] Osama bin
34:00 Laden's got goddamn directed energy
34:02 weapons to space I mean really really
34:05 yeah oh [ __ ] yeah man he just about the
34:08 heath kid online the act being a
34:10 directed-energy weapon kit with the
34:12 launch platform and no problem it was a
34:15 ludicrous question but it did get a
34:17 great answer out of Roseville because
34:19 Russell's standing next to some general
34:21 who I'm sure Rumsfeld controlled but it
34:24 looks over to dude he's like what you
34:25 know what do you think now once Ville is
34:31 [Music]
34:32 he's his own man those foot that way he
34:35 was a naval guy I believe he was a boxer
34:39 so he is he sucking LBJ man he's used to
34:42 being able like it's like a gene Hackman
34:44 you know I don't mean to insult gene but
34:47 you know gene could kick your ass right
34:49 it doesn't matter how big you are he
34:51 just would beat you until he died right
34:53 or you win or he wins so Rumsfeld's got
34:58 some juice in his own brain he's got
35:00 juice all over [ __ ] the Pentagon and
35:02 everything right he helped run Searle
35:05 pharmaceutical to get aspartame into our
35:08 food supply the guy stole chemical
35:10 weapons to [ __ ] Saddam Hussein he was
35:12 a CIA agent I mean where there's [ __ ]
35:16 there's Donald Rumsfeld but he says on
35:19 the mic remember a few days earlier he
35:22 was talking about how the Pentagon had
35:24 lost two point two trillion dollars
35:25 after cooking the books from four point
35:26 four trillion dollars down to two point
35:28 two trillion dollars and then had all
35:30 that investigation material stored on
35:32 the side of the Pentagon that was hit by
35:33 the missile up investigation for
35:37 trillions of dollars you and I do not
35:41 have the mental capacity to conceive of
35:43 a trillion dollars
35:45 4.4 but he says yeah you know we got
35:48 those weapons but you know we're we're
35:52 not gonna use them until we really need
35:54 them right it's like Jesus Christ from
35:56 died 11 happens and you're gonna debate
35:58 what are you waiting for Independence
36:00 Day to use them you know seriously but
36:03 now here's my thought for many years I
36:05 thought that's a dead giveaway that we
36:07 actually have directed-energy weapons
36:08 and look at Donald Rumsfeld a bit it on
36:10 camera maybe there's still 51% of my
36:13 thought process on that opinion poll but
36:16 Donald is smart enough and clever enough
36:19 and just one of these guys to lie just
36:23 look at these folks and go oh yeah sure
36:26 we got that but I could use it and talk
36:29 and he gets back there with Jennings I
36:30 just like that answer
36:31 I can totally [ __ ] these people but
36:33 because we do think that these things
36:34 were actually used for 9/11 whether or
36:36 not he knows about it which I'm sure he
36:38 would they most likely exists okay and
36:42 the theory isn't the theory isn't that
36:46 intense it's building the machine that
36:49 is phenomenal
36:50 right the command & Conquer was pretty
36:55 much on everyone's desktop by 1994 I
36:57 can't remember the year it was released
36:59 but think about a 1994 video game
37:01 theorizes this well I mean these guys
37:03 are genius game designers they read all
37:05 the science fiction stuff they'd be
37:07 popular science magazines and whatever
37:09 and so they they put it in the videogame
37:12 so it's it's a viable theory but when
37:16 you look at these cookie cutter shots
37:17 they become remarkable because I'll try
37:21 to find some they're very difficult to
37:23 find out but you will see perfect ground
37:26 imprints in building roofs sometimes
37:30 they completely penetrate the building
37:32 sometimes look like they scored the top
37:34 of the building it was almost as if
37:36 there was some residual plan to say make
37:40 sure all this is wiped out make sure
37:42 it's so screwed up that we don't have to
37:45 keep any of these buildings because we
37:46 have a reconstruction effort that's
37:47 going to take you know roughly 20 years
37:51 to memorialize this thing we are going
37:53 to build a big building in its place you
37:55 know they would have all that planned
37:56 out
37:56 but there is a distinction you need to
37:59 make when you're looking at this
38:00 photographs because you will see on the
38:03 edge of the cleanup and this these shots
38:05 were shot like within a week within a
38:08 few days of the event by some satellite
38:10 up there right and distributed to us for
38:12 its trauma programming when you do put a
38:16 an earthmover to grab debris and then
38:20 hand it off to trucks you know you're
38:21 picking up trash and handing it off to a
38:23 truck
38:24 well you plot these things down they
38:26 have tracks they're locked down and then
38:29 this thing swivels in a perfect circle
38:31 like a compass and so there are circles
38:37 on the edges that are nice and clean but
38:39 you will see a crane directly in the
38:41 center of the circle so you might
38:43 suspect oh wait a minute maybe some of
38:45 these things are related to cranes well
38:47 once you pay attention you're like oh my
38:49 god but these things are in the center
38:51 of the pile there are no recovery
38:53 vehicles at all and it will be months
38:55 and months and months before anything
38:57 gets to that part of the debris because
38:59 there are mountains of debris you know
39:01 all over the place between the entry
39:04 points and these inner areas so that's
39:06 what kind of makes it very conclusive
39:09 now I can't quite remember the three
39:13 degrees that Judy woods has maybe I'll
39:15 put it on the screen here but I believe
39:18 one of her degrees is metallurgy which
39:21 then when she talks about the foundries
39:24 of metal that were videotaped which the
39:27 construction workers were utterly
39:31 shocked to see I mean how many buildings
39:33 have we destroyed intentionally using
39:35 explosives with controlled demolition
39:37 the family which by the way was the
39:39 first group of people as reported were
39:43 allowed on the pile
39:44 CIA was not allowed on the pile
39:46 controlled demolition was allowed on the
39:47 pile and why would that be well they
39:50 know what blasting caps look like they
39:52 know what blasting material looks like
39:53 they're gonna clean all that up anything
39:56 grossly you know and then you know the
39:59 mines I started in that like the presses
40:01 I someone walk up by seeing a blasting
40:03 cap going holy [ __ ] like this it takes a
40:04 little snap of it puts it on the
40:05 Internet lucky for them 2001 was
40:09 early enough that we didn't have 4k
40:11 phones you know being able to shoot
40:13 everything on planet Earth right
40:15 but the foundries underneath they were
40:18 ridiculous the firefighters were like
40:22 we're digging this stuff out and then
40:24 all of a sudden this you know 2,000
40:27 degrees smoke comes up which will fry a
40:28 human being in two seconds and you know
40:30 you know if you're in the radius of it
40:32 it can fry your lungs in two seconds you
40:34 never breathe again
40:35 meaning you're gonna die of suffocating
40:38 very quickly but nothing explains that
40:42 we blow buildings in Vegas all the time
40:44 there's not a foundry of metal
40:46 underneath why is there a foundry well
40:51 thermate is going to liquefy anything
40:55 that it gets in contact with do
40:58 exclusively to heat so so fahrenheit
41:01 issue then you have directed energy
41:05 weapons which may have contributed to
41:09 boiling this stuff away now I think that
41:12 the boundaries are thermite thermate
41:15 based problems and I think that the
41:17 stuff that was atomized doesn't
41:19 necessarily thermalize at all it turns
41:22 into a cloud now what's interesting
41:25 about building seven just to take a spin
41:27 off one second it's the British reporter
41:30 the woman that said it had fallen about
41:32 25 minutes before it did so she knew it
41:36 was gonna fall she got the script and
41:37 read it too quickly and they literally
41:38 cut her signal off as she's talking back
41:40 to the BBC HQ I'm sure we lost her
41:43 signal oh yeah we've never seen a movie
41:46 before so just keep lying to us the
41:49 other thing is that I don't know if they
41:51 ever really meant for anything to touch
41:52 the building they said you know
41:53 everyone's buying [ __ ] so why not
41:55 sell them some more oh I asked the
41:57 furniture caught on fire and the whole
41:58 building fell down what the penthouse
42:00 was going first right because the
42:01 central column was blown people who were
42:04 that were on the actual site said that
42:06 there was a countdown on a bullhorn I
42:08 think there's some footage of that
42:10 somewhere but they cleaned that crap off
42:11 really quickly - guys were left inside
42:15 to die and one guy grabbed the other
42:19 dude and I should about said that dudes
42:21 came from up above
42:23 stepped on them on the way up well if
42:26 you think there's just fires up up in
42:28 like four four five six seven and you're
42:30 down to floor one you'd stop to help
42:33 somebody you wouldn't just run out but
42:35 you'd run out if you knew this place is
42:37 about to blow get your ass out of there
42:40 the whole day is secondary explosions
42:43 going off constantly that's because
42:46 they're blowing columns strategically
42:48 one at a time making sure that I don't
42:50 have to make it fall yet but enough to
42:52 weaken it so that when it does start its
42:53 collapse the sequence of events and the
42:57 bombs and the techniques are good enough
42:59 to bring it down many of you've seen
43:01 demolition today that's been going on
43:05 for decades but you'll see you know
43:07 you'll put up a video on YouTube to
43:08 watch the demolition because they're
43:09 kind of fun to watch right and you hear
43:11 this Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam but the
43:14 building still hasn't fallen you keep
43:16 watching I just watched one the other
43:17 day it was all that I did today and you
43:20 see the flashes inside still hasn't
43:21 fallen and then at one moment then it's
43:25 like boom boom boom boom boom the whole
43:26 thing comes down and one beautiful thing
43:28 I mean these people who do this maybe
43:31 it's a lot easier than it looks but I'm
43:33 gonna allow it to be mind-blowing still
43:35 that these guys can bring things down
43:37 beautifully and they don't always go as
43:39 planned that's usually in foreign
43:41 third-world countries directed energy
43:44 weapons are the reason why we can have
43:46 these massive clandestine projects
43:49 meaning secret projects within
43:51 intelligence agencies within military
43:53 agencies that we have no [ __ ] clue
43:55 about and what do I mean by that
44:00 okay you watch this episode great and
44:03 you got the theory now go up to talk to
44:04 someone that's just a random human being
44:06 or maybe someone you know that doesn't
44:07 believe in conspiracies in your family
44:10 they say if you ever heard of
44:11 directed-energy weapons no what's that
44:13 well it's the weapon from space that can
44:15 or from a plane or whatever they can hit
44:17 something and atomized the molecule like
44:21 steel aluminum whatever and just watch
44:24 them you know get D rise that is a
44:28 weapon that has been so utterly hid that
44:31 the very concept of the weapon is
44:33 misunderstood
44:35 harp talk to people about harp we have
44:38 no clue that harp exists well they said
44:41 they tore down the one in Alaska I don't
44:43 how the hell did you get there to even
44:45 verify you got to take a plane to even
44:46 get there cuz they built it in a super
44:49 remote area because it's nice to secret
44:51 everyone's pissed off about Hillary
44:52 Clinton's emails which you should be
44:54 secret server
44:55 oh yeah well what's secret server why
44:58 would you have a secret server because
44:59 it's secret if you're in the up-and-up
45:01 why not just use the government server
45:02 it's free and you want to pay for it
45:04 because she was doing a pay-for play
45:06 through her foundation simple top secret
45:09 emails going back and forth alright you
45:11 don't like that great you shouldn't now
45:15 what about these programs where humanity
45:19 can't conceive that they exist it's even
45:22 more mind-fucking than time travel right
45:25 if someone says hey did you hear that
45:27 governments got a time travel well you
45:29 know if half the people go now I doubt
45:31 it
45:31 the other half we go yeah you know what
45:34 I heard and so they understand it's a
45:38 paradigm that exists in their mind but
45:39 directed-energy weapons mmm they can't
45:43 even conceive of it you know when the
45:44 sr-71 was revealed something else is up
45:48 there project Aurora Mach 13 or more
45:51 we've seen the b1 b2 the B to a or
45:55 whatever it's called okay well we know
45:58 about planes we know about
46:00 reconnaissance spy planes we know about
46:02 bomber planes and so we know about
46:04 fighter jets and someone's got a stealth
46:07 one or a wild bunting yeah you know it's
46:09 like if something goes over your head
46:10 looks like a football and then a bomb
46:13 goes off in your neighborhood well it's
46:15 probably that thing that was moving so
46:17 fast it looked like a tiny object but
46:19 it's actually a gigantic bomber plane or
46:21 something's really miniaturized whatever
46:23 right you can conceive of it in your
46:25 head you feel me right and here's the
46:28 other thing so how did I learn about
46:30 this and how did I get convinced about
46:32 this well I watched this gigantic
46:33 documentary from this extremely educated
46:36 female professor but I had to watch the
46:40 videos like 3 hours and 45 minutes or
46:42 something like this who's gonna do that
46:44 if they don't want to believe in the
46:45 first place
46:48 nobody but I've been in my lounge you
46:52 know several times where the subject
46:53 comes up and what's fun is that guys
46:55 where I live at least they're really
46:58 interested in everything they may not
46:59 believe everything but I showed them the
47:02 cookie cutter cuts and I'm pulling it up
47:04 live I don't have anything stored on my
47:05 computer and like okay let's just look
47:07 this up it takes a while to find the
47:09 photo find the photo I assume into it I
47:12 start pointing at this stuff and I said
47:14 how would that happen notice they're
47:16 perfect circles man you get these people
47:18 going oh man look at that the [ __ ] is
47:22 that I'm like mmm dirty deeds man so
47:27 we're in this era of the Great Awakening
47:28 and the Great Awakening is at least a
47:32 couple fold rights it's two or three
47:34 different steps of the red peeling
47:36 process one is to read peel yourself as
47:40 much as you possibly can but then keep
47:42 your brain on in discern reality such as
47:45 you can figure out what disinfo is being
47:47 inserted into your red pill the next
47:50 stage would be refining everything that
47:51 you learned so well and I'm probably not
47:55 this guy but refine it so well that
47:58 anyone who sees it can't unsee it and
48:00 they become a believer of what is at
48:03 least undeniably the truth now again
48:07 architects and engineers for 9/11 truth
48:09 which is a tour guide believe they can
48:14 prove to you that the day's physics
48:16 don't work from the plane crashes to the
48:20 structural collapses they can prove it
48:22 to you all right but you kind of have to
48:26 be an academic to understand what they
48:28 come up with the next stage is to filter
48:31 that down to some telltale things and
48:34 then convert the other blue people or
48:38 the majority of the Blues over to the
48:40 red side having already pre prepped and
48:43 pre-filter disinfo so when you get a red
48:46 blue person coming over the red side
48:47 they're like oh but I heard this I heard
48:49 are those aliens on the moon oh yeah
48:52 that's just so you'll believe that the
48:54 moon missions occurred you know don't
48:55 worry about that oh really huh [ __ ] yeah
48:57 that makes sense okay and I've told
48:59 several people that's you know a little
49:01 and they're like oh yeah you're right oh
49:02 yeah God thought that was true all right
49:05 the third tier up is sort of what's
49:09 insinuated by the cue movement okay so
49:13 this guy says he's in the NSA
49:15 he says he's one of nine people and
49:18 they're working together to bring down
49:20 the deep state well bringing down the
49:22 deep state is quite a few steps right so
49:26 they're having to literally physically
49:29 attack the oligarchy that's been
49:31 controlling this planet the ones that
49:33 are not in office where you take someone
49:37 out you either kill them or detain them
49:39 in the world notices right you can't get
49:41 rid of Queen Elizabeth right she's she
49:43 might be playing ball right now but you
49:45 couldn't take someone like that out
49:46 because you'd notice right or they
49:48 create a cover story whatever but you
49:50 couldn't take out the whole world family
49:51 right I'm not attacking them personally
49:54 I'm just saying that's an example what
49:56 you can't do but you could take out a
49:58 Rothschild ador Soros people are gonna
50:01 notice kinda but at the level they are
50:05 if anyone gets the word you know they're
50:09 dead right yeah I heard is your [ __ ] all
50:12 coming down I think so is it that Trump
50:15 guy yeah and the whole US military holy
50:18 [ __ ] yep and there's a bunch of talk
50:21 underneath us about all of our people
50:23 coming after us you see the parrot right
50:26 Paris right so you see the Hong Kong
50:27 [ __ ] there's a bunch of riots with this
50:29 cute guy all over the place we got here
50:31 that cute guy okay we'll finger him for
50:32 an hour manifesto on each end but let's
50:36 say Q's successful the United States
50:39 military slash Donald Trump is
50:41 successful getting rid of all these deep
50:42 state organizations Federal Reserve is
50:44 completely liquidated maybe they start a
50:48 new bank with a different name maybe
50:49 they keep that name they got the place
50:51 trying to you know maybe reduce the
50:54 impact on us as human beings on citizens
50:56 right but then transparency transparency
51:02 transparency has to be the policy and we
51:06 already know that there are anti
51:09 transparency movements all over the
51:12 place and we have sook
51:14 they're their excuses as to why this
51:18 should remain hidden from the populace
51:22 what are some examples well we got a
51:27 place in groom lake called area 51 all
51:31 right nobody knows what the [ __ ] going
51:32 on they they won't even tell you what
51:34 exists all right well that's a little
51:35 too far now we have satellite
51:38 photographs we know it exists all right
51:41 now we can't tell you what we're doing
51:42 but you got to tell us what you're doing
51:43 you don't need to tell us okay
51:46 the schematics of the Aurora plane
51:49 project you may not need to really
51:50 disclose that to us but the Russians
51:53 know the Chinese no I mean shed half of
51:55 our previous administration sold them
51:57 everything gave them everything so they
51:59 know everything so why hide it from the
52:01 people yeah okay here's what we're doing
52:04 this is how I'd handle it it's some
52:08 joint press conference with all the
52:11 heads of state that could answer
52:12 questions I'd say the pipeline to create
52:17 covert aircraft is something like this
52:20 various organizations in the United
52:23 States are hired to create through a
52:25 skunkworks program meaning hidden
52:27 program you're not to know new
52:30 technologies like the sr-71 b1 b2
52:34 wright-patterson Air Force Base has been
52:36 fingered as one of these research
52:38 centers and then they farm it out to
52:39 Lockheed Martin or some other
52:41 organization to build it once it's built
52:44 it is transported on the ground or flown
52:47 to this groom like area 51 at night and
52:51 then it's tested to the nines it's flown
52:55 out of that or at that base right so no
52:58 one can see it go up all right I have no
53:02 idea what the space jurisdiction is over
53:05 the United States I mean does Russia
53:07 have the you know permission from the
53:10 United States to run a geocentric orbit
53:12 or satellite array over the United
53:13 States taking pictures of us
53:15 do they have some torrid sort of Aurora
53:18 jet that flies over us and takes
53:20 pictures at night and during the day
53:23 don't know no idea
53:26 but if they told us about that pipeline
53:28 they go look okay there's a bunch of
53:30 secret stuff it's related to
53:32 aeronautical engineering space travel
53:34 that's it if they have a time travel
53:37 program they say it if they've got
53:40 aliens stuck on some you know Club Med
53:43 and groom Lake and they should tell us
53:45 now
53:47 if you have a feeling inside yourself
53:50 when I say that that makes you think
53:52 that I'm naive even insinuating such a
53:56 thing I would remind you that a bunch of
53:58 people thought Hillary we got it was
53:59 gonna win the election
54:01 wow she's definitely a win why well
54:03 she's old school she you know is gonna
54:04 throw the votes or whatever no way an
54:07 independent guy can come in even if he's
54:08 running on the appropriate party it
54:12 happened the impossible happened
54:15 according to cue it happened because the
54:17 vote was protected for the very first
54:19 time I could count on one hand the
54:22 people that have told me to my face they
54:24 voted for Hillary maybe there's a lot
54:28 more that just regret they did but we
54:31 can make change we really really can and
54:34 boy what do you want to wait for right
54:36 like what are you waiting for it may
54:38 change everyone waking up that's what's
54:42 happening right now everyone's waking up
54:44 so jump on board now one of the other
54:48 sort of waking up principals goes like
54:51 this some of you have what Q calls the
54:57 autistic does it mean you're autistic it
54:59 just means that you can research things
55:02 at a level that most people can't and
55:04 you can discern information like most
55:07 people can't and canceling out things
55:09 that look ridiculous but then there's
55:14 also equality and some folks that you
55:17 can learn everything and remember it and
55:21 so you have this other extra thing you
55:23 can do but some of folks I know can't
55:27 remember things very well doesn't matter
55:28 what age they are not sure why but they
55:32 can remember a couple things extremely
55:35 well and so I think it would be
55:38 phenomenal for
55:39 everyone to pick something regardless of
55:42 their capacity and capability of
55:43 recalling simply fill up the cup as full
55:47 as you can fill it up without suffering
55:50 any slings or errors of your own
55:51 insanity and then that becomes your
55:56 topic
55:56 Judy was has done her business in the
56:00 directed-energy weapon area she probably
56:02 will come out of whatever else she's
56:05 doing to talk about the Paris fires the
56:07 other fires in California here
56:09 chime in and say yes that's possible no
56:11 that's not last time I saw her she was
56:14 heavily into chemtrails she was studying
56:17 the the nano systems that are being
56:20 dropped the crystalline stuff go see my
56:22 episodes on Morgellons disease you'll
56:25 see all the photographs and how the
56:26 piezo effect can actually cause were me
56:29 looking things to grow out of crystals
56:31 and to construct damn near organically
56:37 patented nano systems that conjunction
56:40 things together it's terrifying man when
56:43 you see that
56:44 Morgellons research it's all under
56:48 agenda21
56:49 / I did - 2030 now you know I made a
56:55 couple clarifications there obviously
56:57 Jen 21 stands for a 21st century for it
57:00 to get a subsequent name 2030 that's
57:03 where it becomes scary that's
57:05 approximately 10 years from today scary
57:11 what's going to be the game in 2030
57:13 right that's a that's like tomorrow for
57:17 most of us right you got a kid that just
57:20 born today 10 years kids 10 years old
57:23 it's nothing man and so it is imperative
57:28 right now the the crazies who believe in
57:31 climate change are the bots offcials
57:33 that believe in climate change are
57:34 running around disturbing Black Friday's
57:36 there that's just kind of funny I think
57:38 Black Friday is a bunch of [ __ ] I
57:40 mean I think Black Friday online if you
57:41 can do it's great but storming a
57:44 storming a department store in the
57:47 middle of the night for me is just crazy
57:50 you're living outside your means if
57:51 that's how you have to get your products
57:53 the stuff is exhausting as well right so
57:58 you can bring climate change stuff to
58:00 people and what's funny is like you know
58:04 when I give people that quick lesson
58:06 about how much co2 is in the greenhouse
58:09 gas layer index which is every chemical
58:11 and gas that is responsible for making
58:14 us have an atmosphere with warmth and
58:18 it's you know point zero five four
58:20 percent of a single percent we're only
58:22 willing to have percent of that percent
58:23 it's nothing it's absolutely negligible
58:26 but you can tell some people this and
58:28 they are so ignorant to the facts and
58:31 how science works that their brain is
58:34 like well it wouldn't be on the news if
58:35 it wasn't real
58:36 I had a waitress stopped me a
58:39 chick-fil-a and she is just I finally
58:43 told her to her face I said look I don't
58:44 want to hear you talk to me if what
58:47 you're gonna say is negative because
58:48 that's all you ever say it's negativity
58:51 she says weird chick but she said then
58:54 you know and about global warming and
58:56 yeah it's kind of irony because it was
58:58 like a really warm day in November so of
59:00 course global warming course it's
59:02 climate change for her because they
59:03 branded it to hide the fact that
59:05 everything's getting colder but I tried
59:08 to lay something down for but she's not
59:10 really kind of one of us so it's tough
59:12 but I said there watched her eyes glaze
59:14 over it was like I just told her we
59:15 didn't go on the moon and she's kind of
59:16 like well you know I talked to the
59:21 manager because she cross pollinated his
59:25 concerns and I just told my said it's
59:29 not it's not real man you got to relax
59:31 get rid of that of your head if you need
59:32 another science let me know well it's
59:35 you know it's not bad for us but seems
59:36 really bad for our kids last thing he
59:38 said which means I didn't hear what you
59:40 said and I still think this is going to
59:41 destroy the world for our children it's
59:43 like come on people the air in Los
59:46 Angeles is never been cleaner since I
59:48 got here should be cleaner sure again to
59:51 be against the scam of climate change
59:55 does not mean you are for everything
59:57 that's making the world suck just means
59:59 we don't fix things through lies right
60:02 so anyway I hope you feel me on this one
60:05 that's a great idea just need to do a
60:07 quick pass on this if you have mid to
60:10 deep thoughts radio calm please go it's
