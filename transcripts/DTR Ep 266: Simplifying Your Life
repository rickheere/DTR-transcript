00:00 [Music]
00:35 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
00:38 welcome back to deep thoughts it's been
00:40 a long time because I've been traveling
00:42 and holy Jesus Jesus is holy how about
00:47 that babalu cigars telling you these
00:56 things are fantastic forgot to mention
00:58 to you buy a box it's 40% off say but
01:03 you smoked an $8 stick you buy a box you
01:05 get 24 about a hundred 10 bucks it's
01:07 freaking amazing today we're going to
01:09 talk about simplifying our lives because
01:12 you'll hear this a lot from people that
01:14 are of the particular age I haven't
01:18 heard it from anyone really under 40 but
01:20 I'm sure it happens it's a very
01:23 important process and it kind of ties
01:26 back to this theme that I talk about a
01:28 lot which is life just seems to happen
01:30 to you doesn't it
01:33 life just seems to happen to you and
01:38 what happens is is you get caught up in
01:40 the way that you've currently you know
01:42 turning your life and you realize holy
01:44 crap I got way too much stuff going on
01:46 right I can't do all this in a
01:49 particular day but you try you think
01:51 well keep what here's what I'll do it
01:52 I'm really overwhelmed I don't want
01:53 anyone to know that I'm so silly that I
01:56 got myself overwhelmed so I'm going to
01:58 pick off the big things or work on the
02:00 small things or whatever you're gonna
02:01 get your load down and you're just gonna
02:02 make a commitment to yourself you're not
02:04 gonna get overwhelmed again sometimes
02:08 that works a lot of times it's not such
02:11 a conscious effort to get overwhelmed
02:13 and so it's all sort of the little tiny
02:15 things that you commit to to get you
02:17 over the barrel
02:18 there's several elements to this thing
02:22 called simplification in it I'm gonna
02:25 talk about getting in trouble first like
02:28 how you get yourself overwhelmed and
02:29 then we'll talk about some means of
02:30 getting out and we're just going to kind
02:33 of go in and out around this sine rhythm
02:38 topic matter subject matter whatever the
02:42 first thing I want to say is go right at
02:44 the guttural spinal cord of this problem
02:46 which is every single one of us are
02:48 different every single one of us have
02:50 different genetics every single one of
02:52 us has a different diet a different
02:54 level of intoxication or toxification
02:57 meaning you put good things in your body
02:59 you put bad things in your body to the
03:02 degree you keep out the toxins go see in
03:04 my episode on toxins you can clarify
03:07 your mind and you will double up the
03:09 speed of your processors that you have
03:11 in your brain some people have a single
03:14 processor that's weak some people have
03:16 medium some of them have you know very
03:19 fast single processor some folks
03:22 although we're gonna get into this
03:24 because some of you're gonna need your
03:25 the the latest trend in this thought
03:26 process some of us have multiple
03:29 processors there's been a lot of talk
03:33 recently over the last I say recently
03:35 probably about 10 15 years that human
03:39 kind does not have the capability of
03:41 multitasking I've talked about on the
03:42 show to the degree that you may not you
03:47 know
03:47 may or may not be able to process one
03:49 equation at the exact same times another
03:51 equation you might be able to convince
03:55 yourself that's the case because you
04:00 might try to push two active processes
04:03 in your consciousness at the same time
04:06 now you know you have an autonomic
04:08 system that runs your body your heart's
04:09 beating the Bloods pumping everything in
04:12 your body is doing something at the
04:13 exact same time so you have this
04:15 profound computer platform which is the
04:18 human body that does all these things at
04:20 the same exact time we would say those
04:24 are not conscious thoughts those are
04:25 subconscious automated thoughts right so
04:28 here's how you have a multi processing
04:30 capability you have a sub conscious
04:33 right it is not in the layer of auto
04:37 Tomic function although there might be a
04:40 little gray overlap there but you can
04:43 process thoughts in the back of your
04:46 mind churning them right someone may
04:50 have told you something outrageous and
04:51 you're simply trying to determine
04:52 whether or not is real so you have to
04:55 process it in your subconscious because
04:57 there's only so much you can do in your
04:58 consciousness before you got to get up
05:00 take a shower go to work all that stuff
05:01 right so the reason why I bring this up
05:08 is that you need to understand and it's
05:11 gonna take you a little while unless you
05:12 spend some time trying to dissect this
05:14 in your own life give yourself some time
05:17 and feel how you process information
05:19 feel how much command you have over your
05:23 brain in terms of processing data now it
05:28 is true a lot of people will say they're
05:29 good multitaskers and you can look right
05:30 out them and go I don't know what you
05:33 think most multitasking means but it
05:34 doesn't mean what you're doing okay but
05:37 some of you will think about it and you
05:38 need to know how much you can process at
05:40 one point in time because it's going to
05:41 be the cornerstone of how much
05:43 commitment you can take all right then
05:47 there's a day everyone has a different
05:50 type of day some of you are up 18 hours
05:53 because that's just the way you like to
05:55 roll some of you are up merely 16 hours
06:00 and you get down for 12 or at least
06:02 you're not processing things
06:03 productively for 12 there's no right or
06:06 wrong way so you do not feel that you
06:08 have to hold up to someone else's
06:09 standards you have a biology you have a
06:11 diet and you have a lifestyle you live
06:13 in a certain hemisphere of the world or
06:15 whatever region of the world that will
06:18 either make you tired or very energetic
06:22 right if you live in the equator for
06:24 instance and you're really really warm
06:25 all the time there's nothing you can do
06:27 about trying to fight the fatigue that
06:28 comes with being overheated and warm I
06:33 know you're like dude like just move on
06:37 but these are important things these are
06:39 the things that are always skipped we're
06:41 talking about the importance of what
06:43 we're capable of doing as human beings
06:45 all right if you're the exception to all
06:48 these notions not necessarily rules then
06:51 man just get ready cuz you know what
06:55 you'll be able to get our life is a hell
06:56 of a lot more than some of us right
06:58 there's usually two reasons why we get
07:00 overwhelmed with our commitments you
07:04 have obligatory commitments that you
07:06 believe exists which are things that
07:07 you're obligated to do I must go to work
07:10 I must do this I must pay attention to
07:12 my boyfriend girlfriend my child my
07:15 parents my friends I must show up with
07:18 these functions that I've signed up for
07:19 because I go to church and I go to this
07:21 cult business class in LA who knows then
07:26 you have the commitments that you bring
07:28 into your life because you are trying to
07:29 be a good person you try to help people
07:32 and there's probably not it's probably
07:37 very few things in life that have more
07:39 reward and more beauty in them than you
07:41 wanting to help another human being
07:42 however that's done like problem is is
07:47 there are limits to resources there are
07:49 limits to the resource of time as well
07:53 as money you probably have some
07:56 obligations in your life that are
07:57 obligatory and so you must go home at
08:00 some point in time right when you get
08:03 overwhelmed there's a incredible level
08:06 of frustration stress and disorientation
08:08 that happens to you when you wake up in
08:10 the morning and realize what you've
08:11 committed to
08:13 it goes from being a wonderful giving
08:15 thing to being an absolutely
08:16 overwhelming and sort of gut-wrenching
08:18 soul-destroying event when you get truly
08:21 overwhelmed you've gone past you know
08:23 the red line in your rpm gauge in your
08:26 body I've done this several times so I'm
08:30 coming from a lot of experience in this
08:33 I know people that can do a million
08:36 things at once I'm pretty good at it I
08:38 used to yeah I used to program and sing
08:44 at the same time you know it was really
08:46 crazy
08:46 I could still do it but I haven't done
08:49 that in a while but you know there's
08:51 things that we can do over and over and
08:53 over and at the same time and then I
08:56 know friends that only have a single
08:57 processor and it's sort of a medium to
08:59 low strength processor what they do with
09:02 that processor is fantastic it doesn't
09:06 mean if they're not amazing people
09:08 it's just they need to really pace
09:09 themselves and there's there's something
09:12 really amazing about this process of
09:14 simplification or simplifying life right
09:18 not sure exactly what I'm gonna call
09:19 this episode just as well call it saying
09:22 no because this is going to be part of
09:25 what you're gonna have to do depending
09:28 on how overwhelmed you are when you see
09:31 a person who is focused and they are
09:34 truly pursuing only one thing in their
09:36 life that they love I'm not sure that
09:41 beauty within the harmony of life is
09:43 more some simplistically gorgeous than
09:46 that event like you find a guy that
09:48 makes surfboards and all he does is make
09:49 surfboards all freaking day of course he
09:52 has a family and friends and that kind
09:54 of stuff but man when he gets into his
09:56 art or she gets into her art they're in
09:57 there and they are just making love to
09:59 this fiberglass right you could name a
10:04 million things I used to watch my
10:05 grandmother make quilts in her later
10:08 years after the kids moved out and my
10:10 god she was just a master at this and
10:13 we'd sit and we talk and she'd just work
10:16 on these things making these patterns
10:17 she look up patterns all throughout
10:19 history and find these windmill patterns
10:21 and just do amazing things and then hand
10:25 them off to the kids
10:26 like thanks mom there are people in
10:30 careers that have been extremely focused
10:33 like I haven't I guess I just talked
10:35 about two careers potentially but I
10:37 could Steve Jobs if the more you know
10:40 about that guy his utter and sheer focus
10:43 is unbelievable he didn't go off and
10:46 host the television show he didn't go
10:48 off and play tennis
10:50 semi-pro he stuck with computers because
10:53 he felt that they were one of the most
10:54 important tools that the average human
10:57 being needed to be able to understanding
10:59 in control it was beautiful
11:03 that's why he's special they cut
11:06 everything out of their lives that
11:08 doesn't have to do with their core goals
11:11 in life and then they focus now the
11:14 beautiful thing about being overwhelmed
11:16 by a bunch of tasks is that tasks
11:20 usually have a beginning middle and end
11:23 some of them don't even have middles you
11:26 just got to go do that thing some tasks
11:29 are reoccurring right I have committed
11:32 to taking out the trash well you know
11:34 what that's just if you're that person
11:35 then you're gonna be taking out trash
11:37 for the rest of your life and that's
11:38 just it
11:38 you could trade you could trade scrub
11:41 and toilet bowls for trash but some of
11:44 you will join a club join a cult you
11:47 won't even know it you'll commit to a
11:51 church more than the single Sunday maybe
11:55 you're doing a Wednesday night thing and
11:56 a couple of their Bible studies and of
11:58 course it's in the name of God so
11:59 there's a lot of immediate guilt if you
12:01 don't work this out so I want you to
12:05 look at your task list of your life if
12:07 you're overwhelmed and simply itemize
12:09 things that have a finite ending to them
12:11 write them difficulty why it's low
12:14 medium high then put a little star by
12:16 them or an R if you want to say
12:19 reoccuring then put the priority on them
12:24 high medium low right do you have to do
12:29 this when you really have to do this or
12:32 is there another way that you could
12:33 distribute this because taking command
12:37 of your life and letting people know
12:38 that you need help is probably one of
12:40 the most amazing things to witness
12:44 someone else saying but a lot of times
12:48 when we get overwhelmed we believe that
12:50 if we go in and say you know and I I
12:52 know I committed to this but I simply
12:54 can't do it that often
12:55 I just can't we feel like the you know
12:58 we're letting down everyone in the end
13:00 they're looking at you like we were
13:02 wondering we were wondering when you
13:04 were going to suddenly be mortal because
13:05 the amount of stuff that you've taken is
13:07 ridiculous once you get your map done
13:13 let's look at this the low-hanging fruit
13:18 is they always say is what we want to go
13:20 after first but stuff that we can get
13:22 off your list right if you can make a
13:25 phone call and get out of an obligation
13:28 especially a reoccurring one and get a
13:30 chunk of your life back those are the
13:32 easiest ones you can do simply apologize
13:35 say man I thought I was going to be able
13:36 to do this but I just can't now
13:39 sometimes there's a monetary investment
13:40 in these things you have paid to join a
13:43 class at that point we want to evaluate
13:47 whether or not the class or whether or
13:49 not whatever you're investing in is
13:50 really truly going to be a
13:52 black-and-white benefit to your life or
13:54 if it's a big crapshoot or if it's just
13:56 something you did to fill up your time
13:58 yeah I was bored back in February and I
14:01 signed up for this thing but now it's
14:02 September and I'm overwhelmed and I'm
14:07 not enjoying the class anymore cuz it's
14:08 just the stressful thing that happens
14:10 right you know I think about the classic
14:12 at this like tight chest feeling and I
14:14 don't want that feeling it's better that
14:15 your health is is more subdued right you
14:19 want that beautiful theme in your life
14:22 that cool kind of groovy silky honey
14:26 feeling inside yourself right when you
14:28 think about your life it's all about you
14:32 know maneuvering through the obstacles
14:34 of life beautifully and you know till
14:37 you're totally bored of all the
14:39 obstacles that you're constantly going
14:40 around and this beautiful racetrack of
14:42 life and then maybe go off-road a little
14:45 bit
14:46 but the difference is is when you go
14:49 off-road I want you to know you're going
14:51 off-road right you're going well okay I
14:53 can handle about three to four things a
14:56 week outside of getting up fitting
14:57 myself my kids whatever going to work
14:59 coming home I can put about two or three
15:01 things in there after work before my
15:04 husband or wife gets angry at me and so
15:07 you got these slots you you have a
15:09 finite amount of things that you can do
15:11 now if you're self-employed then you
15:14 could have hundreds of things throughout
15:16 the week I understand that all right we
15:19 want to know for you what are the things
15:24 that have to take place and what are the
15:27 things that are electorial right you've
15:28 elected to pull them into your life
15:30 there are some things in your life that
15:32 you will say man this is just what keeps
15:36 me going right for those of us to go to
15:39 smoke lounges there is an amazing
15:42 community and a smoke lounge that is
15:44 very difficult to replace any other
15:46 place in life because you will typically
15:48 find a smoke lounge that matches your
15:51 personality the owners typically someone
15:53 you have an Akins a kinship with as well
15:56 as the people who come in because he or
15:58 she attracts that kind of person I say
16:02 she because I recently met a woman who
16:05 works at Bablu knew everything about
16:09 cigars was amazing so you ladies you're
16:13 into this too once we know which your
16:16 normal everyday sort of oblem you know
16:19 like I always say obligatory the things
16:21 you have to do are and you've got it
16:24 really smooth that you know when to get
16:25 up in the morning and no one you have to
16:26 be in bed you know if you stay up an
16:28 extra hour past your bedtime you're
16:30 gonna pay the price the next morning and
16:31 the rest of the day feeling a little bit
16:33 tired you figured out your diet you cut
16:36 out the monster drinks and a little
16:38 energy drinks and you just eat better
16:40 you no longer eat the cheeseburger you
16:42 pack your lunch or you find a better
16:44 place some Whole Foods or something I
16:47 hate to promote be Zoe's [ __ ] but we
16:50 have mothers market here in Southern
16:51 California find someplace that's good
16:53 right then if you add something which we
16:59 would
17:00 we're classifying metaphorically as an
17:02 off-road thing where you're just gonna
17:03 go I'm going here
17:05 I've never been to Gold's Gym before but
17:07 I'm gonna do it because I'm want my body
17:09 to look better or I'm going to join this
17:12 I don't know something something is just
17:16 a typical to your normal journey I want
17:18 you to consciously know that you've
17:19 pulled that into your life now when
17:22 you've pulled something completely
17:23 random in your life it's completely
17:25 random maybe it's good for you maybe
17:26 it's not maybe you can do it maybe you
17:28 can't
17:29 now when you join Gold's Gym and you
17:32 haven't been lifting weights for a long
17:33 time believe me you'll want to commit
17:34 suicide in the first week but don't you
17:36 get that second week you're gonna turn
17:37 into like mr. and mrs. Hulk no I mean
17:40 inside right you're gonna feel really
17:42 really good it's tough to build up those
17:45 cycles it's like you have to punch
17:47 through a membrane that's fighting you
17:49 even if you used to go to the gym all
17:51 the time man going back is like oh my
17:53 god if I eclipse the years of which I'm
17:55 supposed to be in shape the answer's no
17:57 you just got to fight for the pattern
17:59 again but the little things that you do
18:01 for yourself are much better much easier
18:03 to quantify much easier to control in
18:05 your life a tough one
18:08 is when you've actually partnered up
18:09 with another human being to help them or
18:13 maybe they're helping you take your
18:15 taking guitar lessons you're taking drum
18:16 lessons you're learning out of paint so
18:19 they're helping you or you're trying to
18:21 do it the opposite direction if it's for
18:25 you it's a little bit easier because you
18:27 get to control the progress you get to
18:30 control the dedication to the process if
18:32 you're doing it for them well then it's
18:35 like you better pick your clients really
18:36 carefully your customers because if
18:40 they're not fully dedicated to what
18:41 you're trying to do there's a chance
18:44 you're wasting your entire time with
18:46 them and all you might find out a year
18:48 later that all the efforts you put into
18:50 helping them giving them advice
18:52 contributing your resources or whatever
18:55 was just for nothing and it happens
18:58 right what you want to do in those
19:01 particular scenarios in my opinion is to
19:05 completely and utterly pull out you know
19:07 I would say give one phase of like some
19:10 advice to say look you know
19:13 I'm the expert that's why you hired me
19:15 here's my credentials again in case you
19:17 forgot them if they're not acknowledged
19:20 and they're not revered or they're
19:23 getting advice from some other location
19:25 be it good or bad that's fine that's
19:28 fine it's their life you got your life
19:30 the one thing you want to have on your
19:31 deathbed is your life be good not their
19:34 life be good I mean you don't care you
19:36 care you don't care you know it's like I
19:37 hope you have a good life but in the end
19:39 I got to worry about myself if you're
19:42 not happy then everyone else around you
19:44 is gonna notice and you won't be in a
19:46 good place as they say right so there
19:49 are obligations you can make for
19:51 yourself that have a catch-22 to them
19:54 the sort of paradoxical loop of time
19:57 right it's like well I'm trying to get
19:59 you to play the guitar better I'm the
20:02 teacher this time and doesn't appear
20:05 between practices that you're practicing
20:07 outside of us being together it's like
20:10 you seem to be as bad as you were the
20:12 day that you left my studio and then you
20:15 come back and it seems like you learn
20:16 while we're together but then you leave
20:18 and you come back just the infinitesimal
20:20 amount better and you know if you're
20:23 getting paid to do it then it's a
20:25 business take their money whatever right
20:29 sometimes you know even money won't pay
20:31 for that level of boredom but a lot of
20:35 times you know we'll give it away for
20:36 free
20:36 it's family it's friends it's whatever
20:39 and it's a tough one
20:43 that's your really tough one it doesn't
20:46 really matter what age they are you can
20:49 have a 14 year old not understand your
20:51 investment as just as bad as a 54 year
20:54 old you know I will tell you the more
20:57 that you make it look easy to the other
20:59 party it's to the degree you almost
21:01 robbed them of the ability to appreciate
21:04 your efforts and so you have to play
21:08 this game of like well when you report
21:11 what you've done or whatever you have to
21:13 say well I took 8 hours to make this
21:15 happen but I've had that happen to me
21:18 where I've told the client look ice I
21:22 was up till 2:00 in the morning editing
21:23 this video
21:25 I was doing his artwork for two days I
21:27 didn't go to work I you know I didn't do
21:30 anything I could have gone I could have
21:32 had a vacation and I instead I dedicated
21:34 it to you and they still have no
21:37 computational ability to go oh thank you
21:40 you know it just happens the good thing
21:43 is is that you get the experience you
21:44 get the actual boost in your abilities
21:47 right but let's not totally drag out
21:52 this process that you can feel happening
21:54 right now I'm taking you through a phase
21:55 of recognition of these various
21:58 obligations and dividing them up into
22:00 species and that kind of thing let's
22:02 let's take a little break and let's do
22:05 the Tony Robbins let's go forward for
22:07 each one of your lives and spend about
22:09 five or ten minutes just talking about
22:11 what its gonna be like to totally
22:14 simplify your life when you find harmony
22:17 and balance in your life and again let
22:20 me remind you you're the boss you're
22:26 completely the boss you might not think
22:29 you're the boss but you are the boss and
22:31 we're gonna talk about being the boss
22:32 and delegating before the zone when we
22:35 get back in after the break but let's
22:39 just say the alarm clock goes off or
22:42 however you wake up in the morning and
22:45 for the first time in a long time you
22:48 realize you're not pissed off that the
22:50 alarm went off in fact you would have
22:56 accepted it going off maybe half an hour
22:58 to an hour earlier because you're kind
23:01 of ready you got a good night's sleep
23:04 whatever that is for you help before you
23:07 got yourself simplified maybe you needed
23:09 eight to ten hours of sleep because
23:11 you're so unbelievably mentally and
23:14 physically exhausted you needed that
23:17 extra sleep and now that you're
23:18 simplified Oh something magical happens
23:22 you only need four to six hours of sleep
23:26 for those of you who know someone in
23:28 their elderly years was to say 70 or
23:31 above one of the most amazing things
23:33 that happens in old age is that people
23:35 don't need that much sleep and it always
23:38 fascinated
23:38 until I really thought it through they
23:42 live a simplified life because after
23:45 that age being employed at all is pretty
23:47 simple right
23:49 very few 70 plus year old guys have got
23:51 commitments all over the place and
23:53 they're running around trying to prove
23:55 to someone who doesn't exist they can
23:56 drink so much and they could do so much
23:58 and also their stuff they have a house
24:01 they live in apartment they live in they
24:05 get up they eat so many meals they've
24:07 totally figured out the harmony of their
24:08 body over 70 years they figured out
24:11 what's gonna give him indigestion which
24:12 gives them energy what takes it out of
24:14 them
24:14 and they just simply get to 10 o'clock
24:17 at night and they're like I'm pooped
24:19 I'm going to bed but I'll be up at 3:30
24:21 I'll be up at 4 o'clock in the morning
24:23 when everyone else is asleep and then
24:25 there's this peaceful calm beautiful
24:26 little chamber that they're in that
24:28 allows them to plan their day let's say
24:32 you're not that old doesn't matter if
24:34 you are still applies to you but you get
24:37 up and harmony means that your home is
24:40 clean it's clean to your specification
24:43 of the definition of clean your wardrobe
24:46 is clean there's nothing better than
24:48 that feeling right well one your bed
24:50 sheets are clean your house your floor
24:53 is clean and today your favorite clothes
24:57 are ready to where you could go grungy
24:59 if you want or you're kind of paint
25:01 pants or you can totally get really
25:03 tricked out in whatever you're wearing
25:05 your favorite dress your favorite
25:07 whatever and the entire day goes like
25:13 clockwork
25:14 and one of the misconceptions about
25:18 simplification is boredom has nothing to
25:22 do with simplification simplification is
25:25 quite the opposite it's the guy with the
25:26 surfboard company it's my grandmother
25:30 quilty they have picked the most
25:32 rewarding things in their life sort of
25:34 their dream careers and because they're
25:37 simplified they can focus a hundred
25:39 percent and they become above average
25:43 maybe above above average we could call
25:46 it expert level they're revered for
25:49 their contributions their revered for
25:51 their capabilities right
25:52 everything has a texture in life your
25:55 emotions have a texture if you are very
25:58 agitated you have sort of a sawtooth
26:00 texture everything's sort of rough and
26:02 splintery and you're sort of afraid to
26:05 walk through your life because you are
26:08 afraid of getting cut and bruised and
26:11 you know whatever making a mistake in
26:13 front of others but when you have
26:15 simplification and beauty and balance
26:17 and harmony everything sort of is
26:20 polished the Polish marble it's a
26:22 lacquer finish it is polished Chrome
26:27 it's just beautiful it's a soft cashmere
26:30 everything is nice and wonderful
26:32 whatever turns you on is what's going on
26:34 in your life the things that you engage
26:37 in feel better how many times have you
26:40 had a conversation that went really
26:42 wonky you said all the wrong things and
26:44 you didn't mean to you didn't you could
26:47 feel that you wanted to say the right
26:49 things but you just couldn't get the
26:50 words to come together and when you
26:51 walked out of the venue or the place
26:52 location you have this angsty feeling in
26:56 your chest this tightness that you blew
26:57 it okay what's it feel like when you get
27:01 it all right holy hell your Babe Ruth
27:04 you just pointed at the sky and knock
27:07 one completely out of the park no one
27:09 knew where the ball went right and then
27:13 you lay down at night damn second you
27:17 closed those eyelids you are in your
27:19 Fantasyland having the best most
27:21 positive reinforcing flying dreams
27:23 you've ever had in your life it happens
27:26 so this episode is about getting you to
27:29 that harmony okay now some of you might
27:36 say you know I just need a little bit of
27:40 tuning to get to that for you I applaud
27:46 you that's awesome that's the best news
27:48 you could possibly say but some of you
27:50 might be saying my god dude you're right
27:55 but you have no idea how bad it is for
28:02 me
28:03 I'm overwhelmed and you know finding
28:06 your purpose as an episode that might
28:07 juice some of the directives and the
28:10 directions and the vectors that you need
28:12 to use to simplify right cuz you have to
28:14 find something you dig so you use up all
28:18 the episodes slick up the self-help
28:20 playlist on this channel and just cruise
28:23 through the titles until you see one
28:24 that's attached touches to you if one's
28:27 a little ambiguous play it for 15
28:29 minutes 10 minutes whatever my hooks are
28:31 at the front you'll know whether or not
28:33 it's for you stop immediately when it
28:35 doesn't apply to you move to the next
28:36 one right I'm trying to build this
28:40 channel like an encyclopedia you go get
28:43 the information you want at a particular
28:44 chunk you want alien crap jump in the
28:46 alien playlist right Russ bro said
28:49 something really important in the early
28:51 90s and he's a billionaire from the 60s
28:54 his business was converting printed
28:57 documents back into digital form so he
29:00 had a digital scanner scans it and then
29:01 he had human beings clean up all the
29:03 errors in the 60s and 70s so he made
29:05 billions but he said look one of the
29:08 most entertaining things you can do in
29:10 life is to save up for what you want and
29:12 we talked about this in the consumers in
29:15 episode okay the same is true for fixing
29:19 your life and simplifying because like I
29:22 said there's a lot of things you can do
29:23 immediately on day one make phone calls
29:25 you can simply finish tasks that are
29:28 just immediate you finish them and
29:30 they're done and don't obligate yourself
29:32 anything new that's the other thing but
29:35 the brakes on new stuff anyone asks you
29:38 for a favor
29:39 that you could give them you know if
29:43 it's life or death
29:43 you can go ahead and you know commit and
29:46 you know that you're going to feel a way
29:48 about it probably feel pretty good if
29:49 you actually save a life with what
29:51 you're doing but just simply say I would
29:54 love to help you man I would love to
29:56 help you but I just can't I'm so
29:58 completely overwhelmed
30:00 I'm stressed out to the nines anything
30:02 more it's gonna break the camel's back
30:03 so let me get you know I'm working on it
30:06 let me get this worked out maybe I can
30:08 help you in six months
30:10 don't say two weeks
30:13 you know unless you're utterly certain
30:15 you can do it in two weeks
30:16 don't don't set an expectation because
30:18 that'll give you instant ire time and
30:20 that every little bit of angst and worry
30:22 robs you from being able to do what you
30:24 want to do with your life it's part it's
30:25 taking processes up in your processors a
30:28 little background process on your cell
30:29 phone it keeps checking what happened on
30:32 Facebook today it makes all the other
30:34 apps slow and eat your battery you don't
30:36 need that so if that's what's happening
30:38 to you it's eating your energy it's
30:39 eating your subconscious which affects
30:43 your consciousness just know that when
30:46 you start this process and you have any
30:49 minuscule amount of improvement you will
30:53 immediately feel amazing you will
30:57 utterly amazing I have this same and
31:01 I've said it a couple times on the show
31:02 and you're more than happy to borrow it
31:04 because I think it works really really
31:05 well I just said it the other day it's
31:09 called chopping down the redwood with a
31:11 hatchet to review redwoods are so huge
31:15 you can dig gigantic holes to him and
31:16 drive semis through them and they still
31:18 stand up a thousand feet into the sky
31:20 that's how huge they are so chopping it
31:22 down with the smallest blade that you
31:24 could possibly find it's going to take
31:27 months if not a couple years but
31:30 eventually that big tall gigantic
31:32 foreboding forbidding formidable tree is
31:36 going to fall and it's gonna make a big
31:38 boom be careful but every day you show
31:42 up to chop down that tree we love trees
31:46 on this episode so please don't take
31:47 that too literal you know it's you're
31:52 getting closer it will feel good and for
31:55 the first time you gain control over the
31:57 process that's robbing you of the
31:59 simplification of this beauty this
32:02 homogenous existence with everything in
32:04 your circle of life right I guess it
32:07 goes without saying that if you had
32:10 children and a spouse and good friends
32:12 and they haven't been able to see you
32:13 very much which happens to me all the
32:14 time once you get that simplicity then
32:19 you have all the time return back to you
32:23 and that's beautiful now let's say
32:27 you're an employer this is gonna apply
32:30 to family as well as well as roommates
32:33 and that kind of stuff but let's go from
32:35 it from an employer standpoint one of
32:39 the best piece of advice I ever got was
32:41 at Electronic Arts my boss Josh I'll
32:44 just call him Josh I had started in a
32:49 department and I was starting to inherit
32:52 other departments because the department
32:53 heads that were my peers to females they
32:56 they quit and so I got all the producers
33:00 and I got all the art artists I've been
33:02 all those things and so I was very
33:04 accustomed I was already managing the
33:06 coders at the time and my boss had me
33:10 come over to his cubicle he wanted me
33:11 come over which was fairly rare to see
33:16 he just had this not an unassuming
33:17 cubicle and I went over and he said
33:19 speed and he's okay because I want you
33:22 to learn how to delegate because I
33:26 didn't delegate when I first got here
33:28 and I got super overwhelmed I couldn't
33:30 get anything done the problem with the
33:34 two women that had resigned I found out
33:37 what that they hadn't delegated either
33:39 and so they were putting themselves at
33:41 the focal point saying well I don't
33:43 trust the employee so I'm gonna put
33:44 myself as the ultimate approval of all
33:47 things going on in the department and
33:49 they got overwhelmed too so everyone was
33:50 waiting for approval to get anything
33:51 done now I was already a pretty good
33:55 delegator but having this guy tell me to
34:01 do it reinforced it in such a way that I
34:04 went at it in a very conscious way as
34:06 opposed to it kind of a subconscious way
34:09 you may have to do that if you can
34:14 delegate you have to delegate there's a
34:17 couple ways to do it though let me give
34:19 you some tricks I was recently at a
34:22 smoke lounge talking to a gentleman I
34:23 gave him this trick and you should have
34:25 seen his eyes double in size and a big
34:29 grin came across his face was like oh my
34:31 god that's brilliant I'm gonna use that
34:35 and I just pulled this out of the ether
34:37 let me tell you I inherited five
34:40 producers Electronic Arts one of them
34:45 had just been chewed out and told that
34:47 he was on his way out they're gonna fire
34:50 I did one-on-ones with all these
34:53 producers I figured out they were all
34:56 extremely intelligent extremely
34:57 dedicated and extremely knowledgeable
34:58 and I'm sitting there kind of looking at
35:01 this situation going well why is this
35:03 guy get threatened to be fired when he
35:06 seems to be probably the most
35:07 experienced the most capable so I
35:10 brought them all into a room after doing
35:12 the one-on-ones I said guys tell me the
35:16 very best project you have ever worked
35:19 on here in this discipline what went
35:23 right from step one to the last step I
35:26 went down the line with each one of them
35:28 and they got to hear each other stories
35:30 and there's a lot of crossover a lot of
35:32 guys but oh yeah yeah that that was that
35:34 was great that was really cool yeah we
35:36 we need to do that and so I was just
35:38 documenting everything that they said
35:41 now I need buy-in when you take over a
35:43 department of people they got a new boss
35:45 and they're only gonna Christ a new boss
35:47 this guy could be a jerk whatever I last
35:49 bus was a jerk and no one fired them
35:51 they just quit so I just looked out and
35:54 I said okay guys I read it back to them
35:56 I cook I cross pollinated that all the
35:59 discussions found it from two beginning
36:01 to end
36:02 situation that says this it yes it's
36:05 five people we got six really quick
36:08 after that but I said fine
36:10 this is the new policy you just wrote it
36:13 yourself
36:14 and according to you this is the best it
36:16 can be they all looked at each other
36:18 went awesome I had complete buy-in from
36:21 the very first day and guess what I
36:23 wrote a 32 page document writing it in
36:26 stone passed it out the new guy who came
36:29 in very shortly after that got that
36:30 document said fantastic I'll just do
36:33 this the guy that was about to get laid
36:37 off fired whatever ended up taking five
36:41 projects at once nailed all five of them
36:44 at once as soon as he got done with one
36:45 and took another one he
36:46 forgot overwhelmed he loved it he was
36:49 being trusted instead of being you know
36:53 distrusted and undermine by someone's
36:56 summons some hearsay here's what's cool
36:59 about my boss he also resigned too but
37:01 and I got his job as well he went back
37:06 to that employee that he chewed out and
37:07 he apologized and he said you know I
37:11 just was I was believing some stuff that
37:13 I was told from the person who quit and
37:16 you're amazing I'm sorry and the guy
37:20 said no problem man no problem I don't
37:22 even blame you I understand they made up
37:26 and it was fantastic
37:28 right so if you have to take over a
37:30 department that's a little trick you can
37:33 do to get complete buy-in and save
37:35 yourself a lot of hassle and delegate
37:38 okay I never had to babysit these guys I
37:41 checked in with them once a week we had
37:44 one-on-ones once a week and they were
37:47 being heard they loved it we really
37:50 honestly didn't have a bunch of problems
37:52 now I tell you a second thing I think I
37:54 mentioned this earlier but now you got
37:55 the whole paw Paul Harvey to the story
37:57 this might mean a little bit more to you
38:00 the department is running so badly
38:02 unbeknownst to me even though I just
38:04 started in like April I start on April
38:09 Fool's Day can you believe it or not in
38:11 this particular department I found out
38:14 later that the entire department was
38:16 given a death sentence and everyone was
38:18 going to be fired including me because
38:20 we had functioned prior to my existence
38:22 so badly that the number two in the
38:25 entire company a woman was sick and
38:27 tired of it and rightfully so within a
38:31 couple months I went up there and I laid
38:33 out the new plan I'd actually created
38:35 forms to say this is how we're
38:38 organizing the work so everyone can
38:39 understand how much money they're
38:40 spending in their department and how
38:41 much they get for their money and I'll
38:45 never never forget it
38:47 her name's Nancy Smith she's now retired
38:49 I believe she looked at me and said she
38:51 goes this is what I've been waiting for
38:53 for two years this is fantastic
38:56 and what I didn't know was she pulled
38:58 the plug on the
38:59 the caning of the department boom now
39:05 that's a business thing you can do yeah
39:07 again if you're the boss and you can
39:08 delegate to anyone there shouldn't be
39:10 any resistance whatsoever but you want
39:12 to make sure that the person who is
39:13 being delegated to buys into the process
39:15 if you have a crappy employee you're
39:18 just gonna have to say goodbye
39:20 it happens right it must be clear real
39:23 quick that's a footnote there's two
39:25 types of bad employees people who do
39:27 great work but can't work with others
39:29 and people that do crappy work and get
39:31 along with everyone either way it's
39:33 grounds for removal you can give them as
39:36 many warnings as you think don't give
39:37 him any more than three get him out and
39:39 never hire them back again ever ever
39:42 ever I had to lay off a girl who had
39:47 quits because of the previous bosses
39:49 that have made her angry and so I
39:50 thought man you're just angry because
39:52 these people didn't treat your right I
39:53 get it
39:54 I fought for her got her back in within
39:57 a day she tried to find a job in a
39:59 different department to follow a
40:00 boyfriend her whole department mutiny
40:03 Don her and told me to fire her it's
40:04 amazing it's never happened again but
40:08 let's say this is a more of a family
40:11 thing a relationship thing you're going
40:15 to have to work with your relationship
40:19 work with your family to delegate tasks
40:22 right mom can't do everything dad can't
40:25 do everything right if the kids are so
40:27 young they're unable to perform any
40:29 tasks then it's between mom and dad all
40:32 right if you're just in a relationship
40:34 of any kind you don't have kids well you
40:36 just got to divvy things up better if
40:39 you have a task that both of you hates
40:41 like cleaning toilets well maybe you
40:43 have to trade off andand at least you
40:44 get a week or two of relief from that
40:47 one thing that you're really just like
40:48 right I know this stuff is partially
40:52 completely obvious but sometimes we just
40:54 need someone to remind us of the
40:55 completely obvious crap sometimes right
40:57 I know I do
40:59 the thing I want to drive home before we
41:01 in this episode is that life just
41:03 happens to most of us and then we wake
41:06 up to that element of life I had the
41:10 episode of philosophical growth
41:13 the theme of that episode is we
41:15 philosophically absorb reality absorb
41:19 other people's opinions and then we have
41:21 our philosophy but it's not something
41:23 that we totally started from scratch
41:25 right same thing goes with your
41:27 obligations you will inherit obligations
41:31 you'll do something that your father did
41:33 because you're a man you'll do something
41:35 that your mother did because you're a
41:36 woman and you just think that that's
41:39 your responsibility maybe that's
41:41 something that you enjoy you like the
41:43 definition the man changes the oil in
41:45 the car the woman I don't know does
41:48 something else I'm not a woman so I'm
41:50 not come to anything out there
41:51 just make sure did you take inventory of
41:54 all of your obligations and let me tell
41:56 you I hope it's painfully obvious a pen
41:59 and paper is really valuable in this
42:01 exercise pen and paper is probably one
42:04 of the most valuable things you can use
42:06 every day of the week there's that old
42:08 saying that if you wrote down everything
42:10 that sucks in your life on a piece of
42:12 paper and numbered it from one to ten
42:14 you know the worst stuff is at the top
42:17 least worse is at the bottom you know
42:19 first you just write it down and then
42:21 you prioritize it into the slots it
42:24 starts to look really manageable after
42:28 you write it down and you probably don't
42:31 have ten you probably don't have five or
42:35 if you have five you can't get to six
42:36 it's interesting but once you write it
42:38 down and look at it the mystery of its
42:41 intent and its grasp on your life goes
42:45 to almost zero you're like oh I guess I
42:47 just need to deal with that it looks a
42:49 lot easier on paper and so you do it
42:52 this is definitely a weapon in
42:55 simplifying your life right now let me
42:59 say this
43:01 whatever you got left on your list of
43:04 things that you know you have to do
43:05 especially a reoccurring ones I want you
43:09 to rethink how you've accomplished the
43:12 things that you're currently committed
43:14 to the things you have to do what do I
43:19 mean by that well I have an episode way
43:21 back in season one called time
43:22 management it goes into great detail
43:26 about this and I share my own life of
43:28 how how meticulous I am with this
43:30 process might be a good episode of watch
43:31 after this I'm sure it's in a self-help
43:33 section self-improvement playlist right
43:38 you get up and you start cleaning
43:43 yourself most likely at some point in
43:45 the day maybe maybe you're not doing
43:51 that very efficiently what do I mean all
43:56 right well maybe way you've organized
43:58 your bathroom sucks right maybe where
44:02 you keep your towels as bad maybe though
44:05 maybe the frequency by which you clean
44:06 your towels is not good so you don't
44:08 have clean towels you don't you know
44:11 keep track of your razor blades you
44:13 don't use Dollar Shave Club to make sure
44:15 you got what you need maybe you only own
44:18 a hair dryer and what you really need is
44:19 a hair dryer and a hair straightener
44:22 whatever you're spending too much time
44:26 doing a particular task which is eating
44:29 into everything else because you need
44:32 more time to do the more complex stuff
44:33 right if you said look I got my list of
44:36 things I have to do and I did what you
44:38 said I marked them high medium low in
44:40 terms of difficulty now I've got
44:42 something that's low but when I wrote
44:45 the duration of time it takes and
44:47 there's something you might want to do
44:48 for some of these reoccurring ones it
44:51 takes 45 minutes to get ready in the
44:53 morning
44:53 I know there's a massive difference
44:55 between the way guys get ready and girls
44:57 get ready we do but whatever your time
44:59 slot is maybe you can say five minutes
45:02 if you're a guy maybe you can shave 15
45:05 minutes if you're a girl well 15 minutes
45:08 that can add to fixing yourself a cup of
45:10 coffee to kind of give yourself a little
45:12 bump in the morning or just sit down and
45:15 relax
45:15 before you go to work or you add 15
45:17 minutes to your commute you get a little
45:18 earlier to your car and you get there a
45:21 little earlier and now you're looking
45:22 good to the boss right or whatever even
45:25 if you're you're self-employed you own
45:26 your own business maybe get a little 15
45:29 minutes of quiet time for all the
45:31 employees start showing up there's
45:33 something else I want to throw out there
45:35 because it's become this amazing trend I
45:38 mentioned it briefly on the show but not
45:40 quite in this specific reference which
45:42 which is called life hacks most of you
45:46 know exactly what these are they're
45:47 YouTube videos on YouTube you have
45:50 something that you do ritually and it is
45:54 a pain in the butt you don't like to do
45:56 it could let's just give this poll an
45:59 example out of thin air cleaning a
46:00 toilet
46:01 who likes cleaning a toilet really you
46:04 know so you look up life hack fastest
46:09 way to clean a toy most efficient way to
46:11 clean you into a life at cleaning a
46:13 toilet and you find out what the pros
46:15 are doing these guys that clean up
46:17 industrial toilets like 50 toilets at
46:19 night and on five different levels of or
46:22 ten different levels of a skyscraper and
46:25 they don't have all day to sit there and
46:27 scrub and scrub the toothbrush make sure
46:29 everything's perfect but every time you
46:30 go in there in the morning the damn
46:31 thing is completely clean now granted
46:34 they get cleaned every night and you're
46:35 probably not doing that to your own but
46:37 maybe that's what you gotta do take the
46:39 things in your life especially if
46:42 they're ranked low and difficulty but
46:44 high and time consumption and see if you
46:46 can't find a better way I'll tell you
46:49 this much it makes great conversation
46:52 you'll be sitting around some party
46:54 smoke lounge whatever you're doing
46:56 you're chilling out with your friend
46:57 you're taking a taxicab ride
46:58 uber ride and the subject will come up
47:01 about oh you know I'm really busy and I
47:03 don't have this and you're hearing
47:04 someone else who hasn't simplified but
47:06 you have like you know I was in the same
47:09 thing and you know what I did I looked
47:11 up on YouTube this video and there's
47:13 this super simple way to do that thing
47:15 this is what it is boom boom boom and
47:17 then you've improved someone else's life
47:19 and you know you if you can give it to
47:21 an uber driver believe me that Oberer
47:23 drivers like do you know I figured out
47:25 how to wash the toilet faster really hi
47:27 you do this they won't even mention you
47:28 right they kind of pretend like it's
47:30 their idea whatever the more this world
47:33 simplifies the better everyone's gonna
47:35 treat everyone else it's kind of cool
47:38 right for those of you with kids young
47:41 enough to still learn from you well if
47:44 you start doing it efficiently they're
47:45 gonna watch you you're gonna make it a
47:47 chore right mom and dad all right hey
47:50 kids it's time for you to clean the
47:51 bathrooms this is your week to clean
47:53 them you got a dust whatever it is look
47:57 it up see if there's a better way talk
47:59 to your friends see if there's a better
48:00 way my grandmother for instance used to
48:03 clean every article of clothing every
48:08 morning maybe she went two days super
48:12 stretch three days but I mean all the
48:14 towels all of the clothing was all run
48:17 through the washer and dryer that
48:19 morning I could wear my favorite outfit
48:21 every two days probably because I spent
48:23 the last year of my life in the Midwest
48:25 living with my grandparents
48:26 well if you're a single guy what do you
48:28 do you're single dude you wait until all
48:32 of its dirty you take all of it to the
48:35 laundromat all of it to your washer and
48:37 dryer and then you're processing your
48:38 work your colors your whites and your
48:40 your fancy stuff that has to be
48:42 delicately washed right but here's the
48:46 problem with that that yours truly runs
48:48 into all the time that day that you plan
48:51 to do the laundry something else amazing
48:53 became available and you went to that
48:55 party you you did something and you
48:58 missed your time you could just forget
49:00 you could completely forget that every
49:02 article of clothing is completely filthy
49:03 and so the next day you're like smelling
49:06 your clothes to go that's just good
49:08 maybe I can wear that crappy outfit
49:10 today and then that day is the day you
49:12 meet someone you wish you look like you
49:14 know a million bucks
49:15 it's an employer it's a customer it's a
49:17 person whatever I think the best thing
49:20 about simplification is your destiny
49:23 there's a lot of debate of whether or
49:25 not there's a destiny in anyone's life I
49:28 think the best way to say it from my
49:31 experience is you do have things you can
49:34 make your destiny you do you just don't
49:38 because you don't the time maybe you
49:40 touch it maybe you think about it maybe
49:42 you smell it but you can't engage it
49:44 because all this minutia in your life is
49:47 eating you alive you know the theme of
49:50 this show is to think right think about
49:53 all the things you don't think about and
49:56 then hopefully after you've thought
50:00 about things a particular number of
50:03 times it starts to fade into your
50:05 subconscious you get muscle memory for
50:07 the things that you've made decisions
50:08 about and it starts to fade and you just
50:09 start doing it it's a bit like when you
50:11 learn to drive a car right when you
50:13 first start driving a car it's a little
50:14 terrifying
50:16 you're having that steering wheel man
50:18 you're thinking about everything
50:19 nothing's automatic man you know your
50:20 view just the steering wheel a little
50:22 bit you thought about it you know and
50:23 then when you get five years into it you
50:26 drive all the way to work and you can't
50:28 remember what happened did I get a bunch
50:30 of green lights I don't remember tonight
50:32 just the string will a lot finally
50:34 remember did I go fast or slow I don't
50:36 have any idea it's all automatic I'm
50:39 pretty sure I didn't break the spilling
50:40 but what if I did geez I could I had a
50:42 ticket this morning right all those
50:44 weird thoughts but they all vanish don't
50:45 they so for this particular exercise we
50:50 want to have sort of the heart beat of
50:53 evaluating things which you what I want
50:56 to really stress with you guys pardon
50:58 the pun is the stress you feel in your
51:01 chest the angst you feel in your chest
51:02 when things are kind of wobbly okay
51:06 you want to in my opinion I could
51:11 probably make an episode on this but
51:13 you're probably couldn't last an hour
51:14 and this has to do a simplification if
51:17 nothing else you are going about your
51:21 day and when you go about your day
51:24 depending on how much you interact with
51:25 people especially people that mean
51:28 something to you you will invariably get
51:31 to a point where something went wrong
51:34 you're not sure what it is you got home
51:37 from work and you just have this weird
51:40 electrical feeling on your skin and it's
51:43 not pleasant
51:44 it's called angst
51:47 it's it's honestly it is a minor PTSD
51:51 which is happening to you remember PTSD
51:54 is an event that has occurred that has
51:58 been either low medium high or intensely
52:02 intensely high stressful for the human
52:05 body but you've lost the origin of that
52:09 moment for a solider that experiences an
52:11 ie D because the ie D is erasing ten
52:14 minutes of their memory from the
52:16 concussion to their brain they wake up
52:19 with injures injuries they wake up with
52:22 people lost you passed away due to the
52:25 bomb and they're living in this horrific
52:27 pattern but they have no origin for so
52:30 the therapy for PTSD is to get the
52:32 soldier to go back to the moment and
52:33 relive it so they can grasp it and they
52:35 can say oh my god it was the it was the
52:37 ie D that is the reason why I'm having
52:40 all this eggs now I can take all that
52:42 it's inside me push it out in front of
52:44 me and deal with it and once they figure
52:48 out that that's how you heal people with
52:52 PTSD the success rates have been amazing
52:55 and I mean above eighty five percent
52:57 okay they're using virtual reality today
53:00 to recreate the scenes and with with
53:02 these head mounted displays we have
53:05 these little micro ptsds you will have a
53:09 conversation with maybe your mom your
53:12 dad your spouse an interaction with your
53:14 kid on the way to school where your kids
53:16 and that's you know sort of ultra
53:18 disrespect mode just happens and you
53:23 were thinking about driving it was weird
53:26 you were at work you're trying to deal
53:27 with a task and you're just having this
53:29 conversation they're sensing your
53:31 alienation to them and they're getting
53:33 frustrated you're not a hundred percent
53:34 dedicated to them perhaps and whatever
53:36 you ain't you hang up the phone you
53:37 leave the situation and you have this
53:39 subconscious knowledge that something
53:41 went wrong that you're not comfortable
53:43 with you need to make it right you
53:45 either need to make it right within
53:46 yourself and gain a perspective that you
53:48 can live with or you need to go back to
53:50 that person say sorry I you know we were
53:53 on the phone there and I was checking
53:54 out at the grocery store and I totally
53:56 was not engaged in our conversation
53:58 let's have that conversation again I
54:00 want you
54:00 I heard you dented it up and what's
54:03 amazing is like a butterfly that just
54:07 flies to you grabs the angst out of your
54:09 chest and flies offices I'll take care
54:11 of this I'll recycle this it's the
54:13 universe I'll make it positive again but
54:16 you're free you're free of that angst I
54:19 want you to be aware that that is sort
54:22 of a subconscious blocker to performing
54:25 well in a particular day and just what I
54:29 do is I I'll come home I haven't had
54:33 this happen in a while but it happens
54:34 and I'll walk inside and I'll have that
54:36 angst I'll be like what was it what the
54:39 hell am I having angst over and I'll
54:41 start reviewing my entire day I can't
54:44 get up I had conversations that person
54:45 oh right
54:47 it was that it doesn't immediately heal
54:51 it all the time just to know what it is
54:53 sometimes you have to talk out sometimes
54:55 you have to contact someone cinema text
54:57 whatever a lot of times you can just
54:59 think about it with yourself and go okay
55:00 alright I I wasn't my best they were
55:03 pretty good but I was being a little
55:05 flip it or I got pissed off and I
55:07 shouldn't have so I probably should say
55:09 you know apologize for that but if
55:12 nothing else sometimes it doesn't
55:13 involve another human being it's just
55:14 your own management of time you're
55:18 supposed to come home and do that report
55:19 for work or for school and you didn't
55:21 and you party didn't I you're like damn
55:23 it
55:23 I am so tired it's 10:30 at night I'm
55:26 exhausted if I try to write that report
55:27 now I'm gonna do a shitty job so you
55:30 look at your watching like well crap if
55:32 I go to bed right now can I get up
55:34 earlier and get it done in the morning
55:36 please put a dent in it make myself feel
55:37 a little better so we want to think
55:40 about these things we want to identify
55:42 them want to correct them we want to
55:44 build them into our characters so they
55:45 function every day at an autonomic level
55:47 subconscious level simplify your life
55:51 there's almost no one on earth that can
55:53 hear what I'm saying they can't simplify
55:54 a little bit
55:55 yours truly could simplify a lot and I
55:57 am taking great measures to simplify my
56:00 life and one of my things I'm
56:01 simplifying is reducing my social media
56:05 interaction I'm reducing some clients on
56:11 client lists just just
56:13 absolutely cutting them off and just
56:15 saying I'm done the other thing I've
56:17 done with the client thing is I'm
56:20 starting to think about how I take on a
56:22 new client that's more junior and
56:24 whatever they're trying to do doesn't
56:26 matter what age they are okay but I'm
56:28 now gonna put down some pretty stringent
56:30 rules and say look if you want me in
56:32 your life you're gonna take this
56:34 seriously
56:35 the second I feel you're not taking this
56:36 seriously I'm going to shoot a warning
56:37 bow warning shot across your bow we'll
56:39 see how you react and then amount
56:41 because there's other people that could
56:43 use my help and they'll feel respected
56:45 and you may be just too overwhelmed and
56:48 you need to simplify before you can pay
56:49 attention to me whatever it's my time I
56:52 get to manage it however I like you're
56:53 the same way you're the same way
56:56 clients could be your friends your
56:58 family whatever thank you feel me be
57:02 cranking out a lot of episodes here and
57:04 doing a lot of research and reading to
57:06 spawn some pretty cool episodes we're
57:09 gonna get a little bit of a break from
57:11 some of the cerebral stuff I think I
57:13 think I have three in the queue that are
57:14 fairly cerebral so I think you'll enjoy
57:18 them but I am gonna dabble in some just
57:22 fun conspiracy stuff I think in the near
57:24 future here so keep your eyes and ears
57:26 open for all the new people that have
57:29 joined welcome we've definitely taken on
