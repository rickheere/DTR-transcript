00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts
00:33 on this sort of cool monday evening
00:38 so um you know i've been making these
00:41 episodes based on
00:43 ancient lost technology building
00:46 technology
00:49 and what's funny is i just scratched the
00:50 surface i thought i had
00:52 done a fairly deep dive and i have found
00:54 so many other
00:55 channels that are just breathtaking i
00:59 mean one our episodes there's a place
01:00 called uncharted x.com or
01:02 uncharted x probably.com too
01:07 guy does the most thorough episodes on
01:10 whatever he's talking about
01:14 but i've been just bouncing around
01:15 looking at different
01:17 videos but today i was driving my car
01:22 and you know how those of us
01:25 like you and i we try to make sense of
01:27 things
01:29 what really is the linchpin of our
01:32 existence
01:33 is when we find something that doesn't
01:34 make sense
01:37 you just get that feeling you don't have
01:39 the answer necessarily
01:42 but you're kind of like you're putting
01:43 yourself in the shoes of others
01:46 and you're kind of like you try to be
01:49 shakespeare writing iago
01:51 and othello you know it's like he's the
01:53 notorious
01:54 bad guy of shakespeare's entire catalog
01:59 and what you learn when you study
02:01 shakespeare especially through acting
02:03 is that if you had to play iago
02:07 the biggest mistake you could make is
02:09 playing him
02:10 as a bad guy in your mind i'm bad guy on
02:13 the back i'm doing bad things you would
02:15 get it wrong
02:17 i forgot which actor was asked this i
02:18 learned this in acting class but the
02:22 estus actor who i guess
02:23 routinely played bad guys in broadway
02:27 and maybe some motion pictures
02:30 they said what's it like to play bad
02:32 guys all the time
02:34 and he said i don't play bad guys
02:38 i play guys you just precede them as bad
02:44 what he was teaching the person who's
02:45 asking the question was that
02:48 a bad person seldom ever sees themselves
02:51 as a bad person
02:55 now we know there's exceptions to the
02:57 rule there are weirdos that just
02:59 you know they set out to do bad things
03:01 but even in their
03:04 most heinous act i think that that even
03:06 though they might set out to do
03:07 something bad
03:09 before they commit the act it goes right
03:11 in their brain
03:12 they're doing something that they maybe
03:14 don't even have a moral
03:16 compass on they're just going i like
03:18 this i like this i like this i want this
03:20 i want this and
03:21 something bad happens and then maybe
03:23 afterwards immediately regret it
03:27 but when you look at the world
03:31 in any sort of
03:34 i'm gonna say superficial context that
03:36 man generates around things to
03:38 understand things
03:40 spiritual contexts contexts that have
03:43 some sort of upper meaning beyond just
03:47 being here you know just a total atheist
03:50 view of the universe
03:53 and it starts to not make sense on some
03:55 levels
03:57 well lots of levels of course
04:00 i'm not sure how an atheist mine works
04:04 i have an envy for anyone that is not
04:07 full of hate but is also an atheist
04:09 because there's been several incredible
04:12 atheists in the world that
04:14 seem to used to go to one conference at
04:16 another
04:17 and just hate filled speeches about
04:20 everyone else who wasn't like them
04:22 i think that's sad because how much
04:26 could one
04:28 really contribute to their own mind
04:30 slash society in written form or spoken
04:32 form
04:33 if they are sitting in a realm of
04:37 of sort of a a blockade of hatred
04:39 because if you get past that
04:41 to see this enlightened world that's out
04:43 there
04:46 now some of you a lot of us
04:49 more describing ourselves as spiritual
04:53 which leaves a little bit of ambiguity
04:54 and abstraction to
04:57 the fact that we don't know
05:01 why we believe in something why we think
05:03 something is a particular way
05:06 so we don't know but we feel it we feel
05:07 some sort of
05:09 spiritual connection to the universe
05:15 you know we also have very romantic
05:17 concepts like god
05:20 there's even a romantic concept
05:23 in the devil as it applies to god
05:26 how does god become a hero to us well if
05:29 there were no devil
05:32 or demons then god would sort of be a
05:35 benign being and we wouldn't have much
05:37 of a choice
05:38 or challenge to be any other way but i
05:40 guess perfect
05:42 because without the ability to choose
05:44 something that would be perceived as a
05:45 sin slash
05:46 negative slash wrong what would we be
05:50 the perfect i was driving home
05:54 and i was thinking how come the world is
05:57 so screwed up
05:59 i mean we know people who are doing
06:02 these things we know them by name
06:03 they wear crowns they own gigantic
06:06 mansions in europe and america
06:08 and around the world people selling out
06:11 people for a little bit of short-term
06:13 gain
06:14 maybe in a lot of cases for the older
06:17 families
06:18 a lifetime of perceived gain
06:21 although they have to live in the
06:22 neurosis and the narcissism
06:25 and the fear that we're going to come
06:27 take it away
06:28 so they want to get rid of us so there's
06:31 just
06:32 a little bit more peace when they grow
06:33 up
06:36 but imagine just for a split second to
06:38 digress
06:39 into that thought you're a roth child
06:42 you're a windsor you're a habsburg
06:44 you're something big
06:46 something gigantically powerful and
06:47 you've been in power for thousands of
06:49 years
06:49 and you think to yourself gosh if we
06:52 could just get rid of
06:53 most of humanity this agenda 21 thing
06:57 99 of the universe or the sorry universe
06:59 our universe
07:00 earth is gone but we're gonna keep
07:02 around some people because we don't want
07:04 to do any work
07:05 because that's the lazy kind of people
07:07 that we are
07:09 so we need some people to take care of
07:11 our lawns wash our clothing
07:13 fix our food
07:16 you would have to almost strategically
07:19 pick
07:20 the most meek human beings on earth
07:23 and probably starve them down to the
07:25 point where they would almost die
07:27 if you didn't allow them to have a
07:29 little food pellet
07:32 because if you kept around strong
07:35 people to build new buildings to build
07:38 new things
07:39 someone was seriously just basic upper
07:41 body strength
07:44 at any point in time without a shock
07:47 collar
07:47 without some super technical barrier
07:50 between you and them of which the power
07:52 supply is absolutely inaccessible to
07:54 them
07:55 and then you would have to maintain all
07:56 the expertise to maintain the machine to
07:59 keep them
08:00 at bay just like a pet
08:03 they could easily rise up and take a
08:06 hammer
08:08 or a big stick and come into your house
08:11 and clobber you over the head
08:13 until you're dead and then the meek
08:16 would
08:17 quite literally inherit the earth
08:21 or would they be make it all the
08:23 equation never works out
08:26 is my point then we look at the world
08:30 and it's screwed up and for a lot of us
08:33 we want to believe that there's a higher
08:34 being
08:35 a god to make it easy on our minds that
08:39 have a big big problem with infinity
08:43 we go with one god boy is that
08:46 convenient it feels good right it does i
08:49 will tell you that it makes me feel
08:51 more comfortable there's one being in
08:54 charge
08:54 way up there and you might have to go
08:57 through layers to get to that god maybe
08:59 other alien races and that kind of thing
09:02 but eventually there's one god in total
09:04 control of all things and
09:06 god has a threshold of what god will
09:08 allow to happen
09:09 in any corner of the universe
09:13 and then you hear about human
09:14 trafficking you hear about epstein's
09:16 island and you realize well
09:18 that's not true it's simply not true
09:22 children the most innocent beings on
09:24 this earth
09:26 are being liquidated to feed
09:29 a whole culture of celebrities of
09:31 royalty
09:33 of bankers so they can be a little
09:35 younger
09:36 and so they can get high quite literally
09:40 using the lifeblood of a child
09:44 it doesn't sound like god is uh
09:46 intervening much
09:48 based on any moral code that might have
09:49 been handed down on two tablets
09:51 off of a mountain it was almost as if
09:55 that was invented for suckers
09:58 you are these evil greedy mentally ill
10:02 elite
10:04 at least what we call the elite for the
10:05 ruined class
10:07 and they're like how could we get them
10:09 [Music]
10:10 to dumb themselves down such that we
10:14 are untouchable in their minds they
10:16 behave
10:17 we don't in fact they behave so much and
10:20 we understand the human consciousness so
10:22 much that if we can get them
10:24 to be as good spirited as possible
10:26 towards each other
10:27 they can't even conceive of the evil
10:29 that we do
10:31 because the evil things that we do do
10:33 not fit in the consciousness of a good
10:35 person
10:38 most of us feel like we have some sort
10:40 of spiritual interior
10:42 we feel it we do so how do we sort this
10:45 thing
10:46 out we've got visions of people who are
10:49 dead
10:50 walking on earth telling us things that
10:52 only they would know
10:54 so we've had supernatural experiences
10:55 that there's proof
10:57 that we have spirits that were alive at
10:59 one point
11:00 in the flesh at least in a flesh suit
11:03 their being of light has escaped
11:05 due to their mortal coil passing away
11:10 and now they can go wherever they want
11:12 perhaps
11:14 we know some people remain on earth some
11:16 people probably remain on earth
11:18 out of pure choice we have all kinds of
11:21 tales
11:22 from different cultures that say that if
11:24 you're a bad person you can't escape
11:26 earth until you find a way to get reborn
11:29 and redeem your soul to the universe
11:32 such that you almost
11:33 gain the upper maturity to be with
11:37 more pure good-hearted souls
11:42 but what if it's uh
11:46 pretty much the same way it is down here
11:49 at the next level and maybe there's
11:51 several levels
11:53 hard to think you would need infinite
11:54 levels even if we want to
11:57 come to the defense of our own mortality
12:01 and conceiving things
12:05 but what if god is one being who's very
12:08 very powerful
12:09 and perhaps indeed responsible for
12:11 creating our
12:12 little corner of the universe perhaps
12:15 our entire universe
12:17 but the problem is just like we
12:19 experienced down here on earth
12:21 because we are made in his own image
12:23 right
12:25 god is fighting a battle of his own
12:28 maybe
12:30 talk about the devil most of us can feel
12:33 the devil
12:34 and it's not necessarily a christian
12:36 devil by any means it's just a
12:38 convenient word to call something that
12:39 is living for the opposite
12:41 objectives that we live for not quite
12:45 the
12:45 absolute cthulhu he was trying to by way
12:48 of which h.b lovecraft or whatever it
12:50 was
12:51 who romanticized the character where
12:54 that character is essentially undoing
12:56 all existence
12:56 meaning one it's done nothing exists
12:59 which negates its own existence
13:01 therefore probably a silly little
13:04 circular logic problem to make an
13:06 interesting bad guy
13:09 but what if god is fighting a war of his
13:11 own
13:13 what if we are the results of a few lost
13:15 rounds
13:18 and god can only do so much perhaps god
13:21 does have limits now a lot of us
13:24 romanticize our own suffering
13:26 into the realm of this is what we are
13:28 supposed to be doing
13:30 for some reason my grandparents one
13:32 generation my grandparents
13:34 were able to skip the depression
13:38 even though technically they grew up
13:39 during the depression
13:41 they weren't old enough to feel the
13:44 utter ptsd that my
13:48 older grandparents felt
13:52 but they got the roaring 40s after the
13:55 war
13:57 they got the beautiful 50s yes there was
13:59 korean war and nuclear
14:01 they lived through vietnam but they were
14:03 too old to go into the war
14:05 both my grandparents one of my
14:07 grandfathers was in world war
14:08 ii then the 70s
14:12 which cleaned up really nicely the
14:14 unbelievable 80s
14:16 and then for them even though 90s had a
14:18 lot of negativity
14:20 they never listened to gangster rap they
14:22 never listened to grunge
14:23 so they never got into the destruction
14:26 of the american culture
14:28 perhaps the world culture but i don't
14:29 live anywhere else so i can't vouch for
14:31 any of you who live in different
14:32 countries
14:34 by the 2000s they were in their sunset
14:36 years
14:37 passing away before 2010
14:42 so they got for
14:46 the pound-for-pound payback of investing
14:48 in life and following rules
14:50 they got the american dream retirement
14:54 one of my grandmothers never had to work
14:56 well she kind of did but she didn't have
14:58 to
14:59 and all the other three grandparents i
15:01 had worked
15:04 but we want to say that god is around us
15:07 and
15:07 depending on what generation you're born
15:09 into is how you perceive
15:11 religion in the first place for instance
15:14 my grandparents
15:15 all four of them never spoke of any end
15:18 times
15:19 the world was not going to end
15:21 revelations was just a book
15:24 but today my friends who are in their
15:25 60s
15:27 because they got to experience the 60s
15:30 70s and 80s
15:31 and for the last three decades after
15:32 that they're having
15:35 you know their heart pulled out because
15:37 their country is being destroyed
15:38 and yet most of them
15:42 well at least some of them sadly worship
15:43 their own demise
15:45 thinking that what is negative is
15:46 positive and what is positive is
15:48 negative
15:50 they are constantly mentioning
15:53 end times end times
15:57 represents something very comforting for
15:59 someone that can't change the negative
16:02 features of their own perception because
16:05 god will be coming down
16:07 all the angels jesus and he's going to
16:09 clean up the whole planet
16:12 it's an effortless way to deal with
16:14 negativity
16:15 because they don't have to do anything
16:16 to fix anything they just merely need to
16:19 exist day to day
16:21 if god takes them before the second
16:23 coming well then that's that's a clean
16:25 exit
16:26 but if god comes down it cuts their life
16:28 short potentially
16:30 the way it was going and then they
16:32 believe that they have given their soul
16:34 to jesus and they will go to heaven
16:36 so it's clean it's a perfect way to
16:38 believe
16:39 if you are suffering from
16:42 today's slings and arrows
16:47 but let's take our world and reduce it
16:50 perhaps down to a few corporations
16:52 so we can understand it a little bit
16:54 better instead of countries
16:56 it's corporations and let's just say
16:59 you're in washington state
17:01 of america upper left most state in this
17:05 country
17:06 there's a bunch of big corporations up
17:07 there there's microsoft up there
17:10 there's google up there there's some
17:11 apple up there all putting their data
17:13 centers up there
17:14 oregon has some as well but they start
17:17 going
17:18 at each other and they start disrupting
17:20 each other maybe they send people over
17:22 to physically sabotage power supplies
17:24 and air conditioning systems
17:26 maybe they poach each other's employees
17:28 maybe they steal technology from each
17:30 other
17:32 and let's just say some of those
17:34 companies are good and some of them are
17:35 bad
17:37 so you know or you perceive one to be
17:40 good
17:40 and one of you bad hey this company
17:42 started first they invented this
17:43 technology
17:45 and this company stole that technology
17:47 from them and the world didn't seem to
17:49 care
17:50 oh my gosh if that was a lawnmower and
17:53 in your shed or your garage you'd be
17:56 very upset that someone came and stole
17:58 your stuff
17:58 didn't pay for it and then told the
18:00 neighbors that you gave it to them or
18:02 that they didn't steal it in the first
18:03 place and that that's their lawnmower
18:07 well we are on this planet we don't know
18:10 if there's anything outside this planet
18:12 we assume so
18:14 depending on your beliefs
18:17 i have friends that don't believe in
18:18 aliens at all they're christian
18:20 they believe the second coming is right
18:22 around the corner
18:24 and almost every generation that's ever
18:26 dealt with
18:27 an apocalyptic time in humanity and
18:29 we're not there yet
18:31 we're certainly headed there in a hand
18:32 basket if we don't start making changes
18:39 we see a battle on earth
18:42 right now now if giving up all of your
18:45 rights as a human being as defined by
18:47 common law
18:49 is a negative thing you should have the
18:52 right to free speech you should have the
18:53 right to
18:54 your own sovereignty meaning your life
18:55 should not be capable of being taken
18:58 arbitrarily when you follow laws that
19:01 are based on common law
19:02 do no harm to others pretty simple thing
19:06 what you do in your privacy your own
19:07 home is your thing
19:09 can't bring everything from inside your
19:10 home outside and expect everyone to
19:13 perceive it as do no harm because we
19:15 have
19:16 do no harm in the physical form and we
19:18 have do no harm
19:20 in the psychological form which will
19:22 then result
19:23 in a deep spiritual issue most likely
19:27 like a ptsd situation
19:30 we have the perception and the overall
19:34 claim that we are all made equal
19:37 but we certainly don't seem to practice
19:39 that in any level
19:41 and that has nothing to do with your iq
19:43 your race or anything
19:45 we allow people to tell us to go to war
19:48 and we shovel our children
19:50 into these wars and they often don't
19:52 come back
19:53 mothers fathers brothers sisters sons
19:55 and daughters
19:56 they disappear into senseless wars
19:59 hmm doesn't seem very godly does it
20:04 so it seems like there's a battle going
20:05 on
20:08 it seems like if you want to make
20:13 sense of it and i know that there's a
20:16 lot of perceptions that we cannot hold
20:18 within our mind a single thought of god
20:19 and i would agree
20:21 but that doesn't negate the overall
20:22 basic truths of the universe did jesus
20:25 teach us anything
20:26 that was hard to understand no
20:29 but wasn't that supposed to be the
20:30 divine word of god
20:33 even if jesus didn't exist those words
20:35 exist on paper and he seemed pretty
20:36 clear
20:37 pretty easy to believe and follow
20:45 what if god is in a war of his own
20:48 with his devil character
20:52 well there could be two methodologies
20:54 that one could
20:56 frame this easily there's probably more
20:59 but god is over the devil and he's
21:02 simply allowing this to happen because
21:04 of some grand plan
21:06 we must suffer as beings and bizarrely
21:08 we must suffer within generational
21:10 pockets
21:11 my grandparents didn't suffer exactly
21:14 like i did
21:15 one of my grandparents my father's side
21:17 the older side
21:18 suffered through the depression which
21:21 must have been
21:22 horrendous to experience the other
21:25 generation
21:27 did have psychological things going on
21:29 but they never went to
21:31 the korean war vietnam war they enjoyed
21:34 the 70s and they enjoyed the 80s
21:36 were unbothered by the 90s in the 21st
21:38 century so overall
21:40 they lived a pretty darn good life
21:43 but their grandkids and their children
21:47 were victims of economic change
21:51 to enslave the woman into the man's
21:54 realm
21:55 and replacing in her mind the idea that
21:57 being a mother
21:58 was the worst job you could possibly
22:01 ever have
22:01 and being a mother was demeaning and
22:04 today as we know
22:05 even black lives matter groups are now
22:07 preaching that the nuclear family should
22:09 be destroyed
22:11 a chapter right out of huxley's brave
22:14 new world
22:15 which when released i believe in 1938
22:18 was kind of considered a horror book
22:21 a reality children would be strong out
22:24 on drugs
22:24 sex would just be everywhere
22:28 so god creates the devil and allows him
22:32 to go
22:32 absolutely crazy and disproportionately
22:35 so
22:36 for some odd reason but now let's
22:40 uh let's break the molds
22:43 because this second example the second
22:47 paradigm of that war
22:49 is never communicated in my circles ever
22:54 i've never read it
22:57 it goes something like this the devil
23:00 and god are brothers
23:03 they're equal one is not more powerful
23:06 than the other but one could cancel the
23:08 other
23:10 and they're at war which is why we lose
23:13 rounds
23:14 and we win rounds equally brilliant
23:18 in their positive and negative alignment
23:21 the devil can always outsmart god and
23:23 the guy can always outsmart the devil
23:27 their tic tac tic-tac-toe games are just
23:30 draws their chess games or
23:32 draws one never wins but we're down here
23:36 like characters and clash of titans
23:39 where the greek gods are above us just
23:42 moving us around
23:43 having fun at our expense celebrating in
23:46 the times when they win their sign
23:50 think about it in the last say 30 years
23:53 of american history
23:55 the bad guy has been winning every
23:57 single round
24:00 right our cultures being turned upside
24:04 down
24:07 mental illness on this planet has never
24:10 been
24:11 more prevalent in any recorded moment
24:13 that i've ever read in history
24:16 we have mentally ill people probably one
24:19 out of three
24:21 and not just basically mentally ill but
24:23 absolutely
24:24 amazingly ill in the mind
24:28 and able to look in the mirror and
24:29 perceive who they are
24:31 because they've been watching too much
24:32 tv
24:35 they've been trying to get on the
24:36 winning team
24:38 even if that team says they were to
24:41 sacrifice
24:42 all the beautiful things that they would
24:44 have experienced have they not join the
24:45 team
24:47 but they're so terrified and programmed
24:48 that they're the disenfranchised
24:51 that they join anyway a bad decision
24:55 ask most of the kids that got out of the
24:57 big gangs in the world
24:59 and he said man that was uh that's not a
25:01 good idea i mean some things i would
25:02 keep because it built me up as a man or
25:04 as a woman or whatever
25:08 but overall they've done things they
25:12 regret but there's a
25:15 non-religious version of this story
25:18 which
25:18 erases god and erases the devil
25:22 at least in any meaningful form because
25:25 a god that would allow the suffering
25:26 that we see on earth is
25:28 sort of an obsolete god right well so
25:31 what you exist
25:33 if if we this is what's interesting
25:36 this is what's really fascinating and
25:38 something we don't talk about much
25:41 if you were to turn earth into a
25:43 metaphor of your family
25:45 and for some reason you live a long time
25:47 you live three times
25:48 normal you're guaranteed to make it to
25:50 the year 300 if you don't get hit by a
25:52 bus
25:53 and instead of having one or two
25:55 children you're going to have
25:56 hundreds of thousands of children and
25:58 grandchildren etc
26:01 if you were to treat and this is a
26:04 christian based or even a religious
26:06 based realm
26:06 definitely a christian based story
26:10 if you were to let your children suffer
26:12 the slings and arrows
26:14 that you suffer at the hands of god
26:17 you would worry that your soul would
26:20 never make it through the eye of the
26:21 needle
26:22 you would not be in the book of peter
26:25 you would not make it into the gates of
26:26 heaven
26:28 because you would have allowed the
26:30 suffering
26:31 knowingly allowed the suffering of your
26:33 own kids
26:35 you would allow them to be consumed in
26:36 rituals
26:38 to suffer at the infancy of total pure
26:42 innocence
26:43 you would allow one of your other kids
26:45 to grab that kid
26:47 on an altar and murder them
26:50 for some pleasure murder them for a
26:52 little bit of
26:54 biological matter that might reduce
26:56 their aging you would have allowed that
26:58 to occur
27:00 what kind of person would you be at the
27:02 end of that life
27:04 you could have stopped it but you didn't
27:07 you may lean on the philosophy that oh i
27:11 couldn't interrupt
27:12 my child's life i must let them live
27:14 their own life
27:15 but you allowed common law to be broken
27:18 when you could have easily stopped it
27:21 you're not going to stop everything
27:23 someone's going to stub their toe you're
27:24 going to allow that to happen they're
27:25 going to drive their car too fast
27:26 you're not going to stop them
27:30 but straight out vicious evil acts
27:33 are very apparent on this planet and
27:35 there's a person or being
27:37 in a religious realm that's responsible
27:39 for
27:40 100 percent
27:43 interesting right god starts to look a
27:46 little bit different in your eyes
27:48 doesn't he
27:50 but there's a whole group of people who
27:53 are doing research
27:55 who believe that up from us is not a god
28:00 necessarily
28:02 they're god's plural and they
28:06 are what we call in common culture today
28:09 aliens aliens perhaps that we were
28:13 spliced from
28:14 aliens perhaps we are direct descendants
28:16 of
28:18 and therefore the game above us is very
28:21 similar to the game that we're living
28:23 it's a competition to see who can win
28:29 no one seems to be stopping the evil
28:31 although
28:32 some people are talking about attempting
28:34 to do so
28:35 and perhaps we're on the brink of a
28:37 wonderful era
28:38 where the humanity wakes up and there's
28:41 more signs of people waking up now
28:43 than ever before just got another call
28:46 today
28:47 and a friend of mine's wife is so bloody
28:50 awake it's
28:51 absolutely amazing i listened to her on
28:53 the phone i talked her on the phone
28:55 speaker phone
28:56 and by god she sounds like the most
28:58 vicious anon right now
29:00 of any of the nouns i've ever heard and
29:02 she's really a brilliant woman to begin
29:04 with
29:05 so she's using her powers for good
29:08 and she's researching like 10 hour days
29:10 like all of us do when we
29:12 wake up because it's mind-blowing but
29:14 all the evidence of
29:15 all the wrongdoings slash defined by
29:18 common law violations
29:20 is so easy to find but it's never being
29:23 reported in the
29:24 fake news it's never being
29:27 ingested or observed by those that are
29:30 constantly on the other side of the
29:31 coin those who have sold their souls
29:36 to pure and unadulterated destruction
29:40 of humanity of the spirit and aka
29:44 of the world
29:47 the one thing that is interesting about
29:49 these ideas
29:50 of saying okay man is suffering
29:54 crazy if you live in a first world
29:56 country
29:57 then you would have to do research to
29:59 find
30:01 not only the pain and suffering within
30:02 your own region region which you
30:04 probably have your own examples of
30:06 but if you were to set a bar and say
30:08 this bar
30:09 is the maximum suffering that i am aware
30:11 of and it could be some pretty vicious
30:12 things
30:15 again i'm not even sure that death is
30:18 the most vicious thing that can occur i
30:20 think an entire lifetime of suffering
30:23 dwarfs someone who's allowed to escape
30:25 back into their light form and hopefully
30:27 where we go
30:28 is where all the people who have had
30:30 near-death experiences say we go
30:32 which is a beautiful place with no pain
30:35 the place they wanted to stay
30:37 even though they were told to come back
30:38 down and again we're
30:40 we're thousands of people who've talked
30:42 about this
30:44 but you look at the people in south
30:46 america who are suffering due to the
30:48 banking systems of europe
30:49 destroying them and of course there's
30:51 plenty of evil people down there to sell
30:53 out their own people
30:54 what's really strange and i was in a
30:56 conversation with a friend of mine
30:57 yesterday
30:59 we're talking about the mexican federal
31:01 rallies if you're not familiar with
31:03 these this is the police force that
31:06 basically polices mexico when i first
31:08 moved to california in 1987 i
31:10 immediately started hearing about the
31:12 corrupt
31:12 federal rallies the corruption is
31:16 not the worst in the world that i've
31:18 heard there's other drug cartel elements
31:20 down there that do
31:22 the beheadings and those sorts of things
31:26 but i have a friend of mine that goes
31:27 down to mexico routinely
31:30 and every time he goes down there
31:32 virtually he gets stopped by the federal
31:33 rallies and he's got to bribe them
31:35 with money typically or other items to
31:38 get them
31:39 to let him go and he's not doing
31:40 anything never has he's not a criminal
31:42 by any means
31:44 i don't think he's ever done anything
31:45 illegitimate in his life uh
31:48 that what they would be upset with
31:52 but it's supposed to be a christian
31:53 based country right
31:56 catholicism for one is one of the
31:58 predominant churches in south america
32:01 and they're very strict about it they
32:03 all have children that when they hit a
32:05 certain age they have certain ceremonies
32:07 to have a rite of passage for the girl
32:08 write a passage for the boy
32:10 they go to churches where they go to
32:13 confession they give money
32:15 they wear crosses are on their chests
32:17 they have crosses on their walls at home
32:20 but there's not a single federal rally
32:22 that by the standards of god
32:23 would ever be allowed in heaven unless
32:26 he's that one guy or girl
32:28 who never crossed the line and i've
32:30 never heard of one
32:31 it's interesting ms-13 who comes out of
32:34 san salvador
32:35 and all the drug cartel folks well
32:38 do they not have religion when they
32:41 paint their bodies with all of their
32:43 tattoos
32:44 they have crosses typically on their
32:46 bodies
32:48 but they will commit the worst crimes
32:50 their people do
32:53 how does that work hmm
32:56 at some point being evil looks
32:59 like something else like the actor said
33:03 they don't believe that what they're
33:04 doing is evil i guess
33:06 or out of perhaps a cowardice to make
33:09 people
33:11 fear them to counteract their own fear
33:13 inside themselves
33:15 they engage in these activities to feel
33:17 like they have control no one can hurt
33:19 me because i can hurt other people and i
33:21 prove it every day
33:22 by doing what i do venezuela
33:26 which over the years has been known as a
33:28 romantic country
33:30 with amazing culture amazing amazing
33:32 architect
33:33 texture teenage girls are getting
33:37 destroyed by six-packs every single day
33:40 it's horrific how is that occurring
33:43 in africa well they're very aware
33:47 that europe china and all these all of
33:50 our countries are going in there
33:52 to rape the land they buy the land they
33:54 steal the minerals they steal the
33:56 the gold you know when they mine gold in
33:59 south africa
34:01 nobody even knows where the gold goes as
34:04 soon as it leaves the factory
34:06 there's no paperwork to say where it
34:07 goes it's all being taken somewhere
34:11 being raped diamonds just
34:15 float like sand particles on some of the
34:17 beaches in africa
34:20 they protect those beaches to make sure
34:21 the diamond market
34:23 for the modern cultures don't lose their
34:25 value so
34:26 the power structure behind buying
34:27 precious stones doesn't get interrupted
34:31 the countries seem to be led by folks
34:34 that
34:34 some for a moment will care about their
34:36 people and try to protect their people
34:38 and others are sort of
34:42 promoted warlords now presidents because
34:44 they
34:45 took their militia knocked out the
34:47 original government
34:48 that was for the people now they're
34:50 taking bribes
34:51 from countries in europe maybe even
34:54 america
34:55 to treat their people bad to create
34:56 moments of genocide
35:00 who is running the planet hmm
35:04 is it strictly a situation where we
35:08 evolutionarily get stupider as time goes
35:11 on
35:12 well that doesn't seem to make any sense
35:15 that doesn't make any sense at all
35:18 unless the aperture of knowledge is
35:20 absolutely cut off by those who have
35:22 the means to do so it's not me and it's
35:25 not you
35:27 it's all built out of potentially for
35:29 human beings
35:30 fear fear that a particular group if
35:33 allowed to
35:34 become intelligent would get angry at
35:36 how they've been treated
35:38 and they want retribution and they have
35:40 the physical capabilities as long as
35:41 they got the weapons that matched our
35:43 weapons
35:45 to come get that retribution
35:49 and so because a very tiny my new group
35:53 of world population that we continue to
35:55 allow
35:56 to tell us to go to war to tell us that
35:58 we hate each other
36:02 they have created a bad name for you and
36:04 me with other cultures
36:07 it doesn't even matter what race you are
36:08 on planet earth
36:10 you could be watching this video in
36:11 uganda and you know that somewhere in
36:13 your region
36:15 there's a country next door that thinks
36:17 that you're a bad person because
36:18 something that happened that was before
36:20 you were even born
36:24 hmm it doesn't seem very godlike does it
36:28 doesn't even seem remotely in the theme
36:30 of godlikeness right
36:33 we like to believe that the world has a
36:35 purpose that we're here to refine our
36:37 souls come in and out forever
36:39 and maybe that's simply the game there
36:41 is no god we are all god
36:43 we're all the same life force
36:46 coming down like tentacles and every
36:48 time we touch this dimension
36:50 there spawns our soul but we really have
36:53 a link back
36:54 like a root back to the central
36:57 trunk of the tree the tree of life
37:00 we have our souls and other dimensions
37:02 go out the other side of the tree
37:04 who knows so maybe it doesn't even
37:06 matter
37:07 what we do when we're here but it seems
37:10 like
37:12 it's beautiful when man creates things
37:14 isn't it
37:16 when someone creates an amazing song a
37:19 piece of art
37:21 or can spiritually enlighten someone
37:23 else
37:24 pass some knowledge on so a little kid
37:26 can create
37:28 robots a rocket
37:31 something cool
37:34 now the alien theory is interesting
37:36 because all of a sudden
37:38 when you go to an alien level of
37:40 overlords
37:41 over us still it erases the need for god
37:45 because a god is supposed to impose
37:47 some standards by which we are supposed
37:50 to follow
37:51 and so is god we're not supposed to sin
37:54 we're not supposed to hurt each other
37:55 so a god shouldn't make a world where
37:57 this can all happen and there's a lot of
37:58 folks
37:59 that use that as their mechanism to not
38:02 believe in a god and i completely
38:03 understand
38:04 it especially the older that i get
38:09 at least the traditional definition
38:13 but we've heard you know romantic story
38:16 after romantic story about alien races
38:18 from reptilian to mantis to
38:21 um i guess the greys are also called
38:23 sort of reptilian
38:25 mindset right but we also have the david
38:27 eye super duper look like
38:29 sleeve stack dudes they fought captain
38:32 kirk
38:35 we hear about the archons the anunnakis
38:38 the
38:38 aliens there's a huge list any guy who
38:41 ever made up a story about an alien well
38:44 unless you can prove that guy to be
38:45 lying unless he confesses to lie
38:48 which all he has to do is not confess to
38:50 lying and then you have to keep that in
38:52 the
38:53 in the glossary of alien possibility
38:59 again the the guy that was in the
39:01 original project disclosure was stephen
39:03 grier
39:04 where he came during the press
39:05 conference when asked what do these
39:07 aliens look like
39:08 i believe the number he came up was like
39:10 27.
39:12 okay let's just go with that 27
39:15 different alien races
39:17 oh my gosh a completely different alien
39:20 race we're talking about
39:22 not like us where we're worried about
39:23 whether you have melatonin in your blood
39:26 to be fully developed as nick cannon
39:28 said
39:29 we are completely different
39:33 in species from these other beings
39:36 unless perhaps in a dominant gene
39:38 sequence situation
39:40 they do drop a little bit of their blood
39:42 inside humanity and they say no matter
39:44 where this blood goes there's always
39:46 going to be a first born
39:47 if the firstborn happens let's just say
39:50 and because they're going to want to do
39:51 the firstborn because it's all
39:52 programmed and they're going to have
39:53 more intelligence more sensibility to
39:55 stay alive
39:56 and so we're always going to keep
39:57 masters of the universe on earth or
40:00 direct copies of ourselves perhaps a
40:01 little shorter whatever because maybe
40:03 they were like
40:04 30 feet tall maybe they live tens of
40:06 thousands of years
40:08 we still have a a normal adjustment our
40:11 visual cortex is cut down so we can't
40:13 see anything beyond what we see
40:18 but when you were to have and we've seen
40:20 star trek right
40:21 gene rod berry star trek especially
40:24 in the 90s from 87 to 2005
40:29 they incubated so many scenarios through
40:32 all those different shows
40:33 next generation deep space nine voyager
40:36 and start and enterprise excuse me
40:39 they have shown us a million different
40:42 ways that an episode
40:44 of encountering
40:47 races or such species would interact
40:52 now of course on that show having to
40:55 deal with human actors to realize the
40:56 show
40:58 it wasn't really until enterprise where
40:59 they had some cg at their hands so they
41:01 could actually create
41:03 completely different beings before that
41:05 they did do it but it was pretty rare
41:07 because it required a
41:09 a very bizarre prop a slash costume
41:12 around a being
41:13 that would um interfere with being able
41:16 to communicate start sounding like
41:17 someone talking in a mask they did it a
41:18 few times
41:20 but they had reptilians kardashians
41:24 pretty strange looking guys
41:29 but we can see how the priorities of
41:32 different races
41:34 would struggle
41:38 just by sheer imperfectness
41:42 with each other and their goals
41:45 but what would their goals be
41:48 there were a lot of writings in the past
41:50 from
41:51 greek philosophers to um
41:55 babylonian writers talking about
41:58 races coming down like the anunnaki and
42:01 and enslaving mankind to dig gold that's
42:04 actually in their stories
42:05 big gold to dig gold when if you had any
42:08 interstellar travel like i always say on
42:11 this show
42:12 you could make gold with fusion
42:15 be no problem if you had an antimatter
42:18 engine
42:19 or any type of infinite energy supply
42:20 which obviously they would have to get
42:22 here
42:23 even if they're interdimensional they
42:26 could just make gold what the hell you
42:27 can do with it all
42:28 right
42:31 some of those stories are very man-made
42:35 but the other interesting thing is that
42:38 we don't
42:39 see god we don't see
42:42 the devil and i mean like in angel form
42:45 in demon form we don't
42:47 we we definitely know people we think
42:48 have been possessed that's for sure and
42:50 we definitely know people we think have
42:51 been angels in our lives right
42:54 whether they know it or not
42:57 but we don't see aliens we think we see
43:00 ufos
43:01 some of us think we've had experience
43:03 with aliens
43:05 but they're not here on a daily basis
43:07 they're not saying dude what's up you
43:08 want to join our team
43:10 what's your team about well we're all
43:11 about knowledge and wisdom and expansion
43:13 and ascension and creativity we come to
43:16 our planet none of this crap exists
43:18 there's none of these jerks
43:19 running the planet we don't hurt
43:21 children
43:23 so if you want to pick up your stuff and
43:24 go let's do it and then we'd all get on
43:26 the ship and get out of here
43:28 then they'd probably eat us on the other
43:30 side but you know what i'm saying
43:32 we don't have any options this is all
43:34 sort of a
43:35 fictional construct in our minds based
43:38 on things we do see in order to create a
43:40 paradigm for us to co-exist
43:43 in pure insanity
43:47 the trouble with insanity is that we as
43:49 human beings looking at other insane
43:51 human beings
43:53 some of them have mutilated their bodies
43:54 to the point where
43:56 they're never going to get it back to
43:57 normal ever
43:59 some of them are just mentally insane we
44:02 hope
44:03 this is a very sophisticated hope
44:06 statement
44:07 that they're only on a particular drug
44:09 that if we could get them off the drug
44:10 and get them rehabilitated
44:12 that they would return back to whoever
44:14 they were
44:15 and we would have the option of offering
44:17 them the ability to be educated
44:19 however they wish such that they become
44:21 a productive member of society
44:24 but i don't think anyone's holding their
44:26 breath right
44:28 and that's a bummer
44:31 we have crazy old people like george
44:33 soros
44:35 who is literally crazy man he is
44:39 and he is the snake eating its tail he's
44:41 at the precipice
44:42 of genius and crazy man
44:46 he's got 180 corporations he's just put
44:48 in
44:49 220 million dollars into this
44:52 program to alter the election of the
44:56 united states of america which is an
44:57 international felony anywhere in the
44:59 world
45:00 you're not allowed to meddle with other
45:01 people's elections but he's overtly said
45:04 it
45:05 at various conferences and no one seems
45:07 to stop him
45:09 so who's running this planet why
45:11 wouldn't someone stop him
45:13 i mean it's like saying i'm going to
45:14 kill all the children in the world
45:16 in the middle of a statement to the eu
45:19 or some g20 or something
45:22 really i tend to think that that
45:25 should make people one know what kind of
45:28 person he is but two
45:29 want to stop them at all costs
45:33 but not even a retired navy seal or
45:35 retired delta force
45:36 squad is going after these people it's
45:40 as if we're all
45:40 sitting here going well i was told to
45:41 follow orders and if i don't get orders
45:43 to
45:44 protect my own universe in a common law
45:46 manner
45:49 but i guess i'll just let it do whatever
45:51 it's going to do
45:53 maybe if we recycle if we are
45:56 truly reincarnated it doesn't matter
46:00 maybe you can just do whatever the hell
46:01 you want
46:03 society seems to disagree with that even
46:06 if you did recycle
46:08 you leave people alone in this world you
46:10 don't
46:11 tell people to do things at all except
46:14 don't harm you
46:16 but even defining what harm is today is
46:19 a
46:20 gray area science is ignored
46:24 while pseudoscience and pop science is
46:26 becoming
46:29 official methodology in the universe
46:35 i was telling my friend the other day
46:39 because you know richard vase made uh
46:43 the movie about lying he was in a world
46:46 where no one understood a lie and he was
46:48 the first person to invent a lie
46:50 and he was having a blast running around
46:52 lying to people
46:54 and he was getting money out of banks he
46:56 was potentially sleeping with women
46:58 just because he said that he had a
47:00 medical condition and this woman had to
47:02 sleep with him to help him out it was
47:03 brilliant movie
47:06 the invention of a lie and it's
47:09 interesting
47:10 that we as human beings allow a lot of
47:12 evil to spread all over the world
47:14 because we
47:15 aren't willing to consider for a second
47:18 the information that we were given was a
47:19 lie to begin with because it was so
47:21 romanticized when it was given to us
47:24 and then those lies get embedded into
47:29 flying quote science
47:33 when i looked at the first sumerian
47:34 tablets and mud
47:36 defining their day-to-day lives and you
47:39 know some of these tablets have
47:41 transactions of a merchant to a citizen
47:45 it talks about how to rotate crops and a
47:48 bunch of other
47:49 empirical information about how to live
47:51 in a society
47:52 talks about all kinds of wild stories
47:54 and tales
47:57 you start to think well how do
48:00 how would we know these tablets weren't
48:03 made recently it's just
48:08 mud oh sure if you made him yesterday
48:11 you would know
48:13 but if you made him 50 years ago and you
48:14 dug him up 50 years later
48:17 and you've simulated the wear and tear
48:20 in an exponential manner to make them
48:22 look like the other ones
48:24 that maybe you did find which just
48:25 basically said
48:28 today was my birthday
48:32 the dead sea scrolls are so conveniently
48:34 dug up to
48:36 stabilize a religion
48:39 never questioned for authenticity
48:42 written by man way after the fact
48:47 the people lean on those scrolls as
48:50 absolute proof
48:51 of the story proof
48:56 they're dug up in 1947.
48:59 okay so you write them about 1900 you
49:01 leave them in some jars
49:03 that you found somewhere else you age
49:05 them
49:06 do you realize that right now in in the
49:08 world today
49:10 there are experts who evaluate
49:14 fake artifacts all day long
49:18 fake busts of augusta and caesar
49:22 all kinds of just pieces of art and the
49:25 experts sometimes can see it really
49:28 really quickly oh that's definitely a
49:29 fake the hair doesn't do that in the in
49:31 the old days you can't do this without
49:33 modern tools
49:34 and then sometimes a forgery is so good
49:37 but it might take one of these experts
49:40 who's been at it for 20 years
49:44 five years to a decade to finally
49:47 uncover
49:48 with an equipment that wasn't around
49:51 five and ten years ago
49:52 to to x-ray it from the inside and find
49:55 out oh my gosh it just says
49:58 made in china on the inside we now know
50:02 beyond the shadow of a doubt that there
50:03 was a culture before the one that we
50:06 are today
50:11 with very sophisticated tools
50:16 they've hatched this idea that there was
50:17 a cataclysmic event
50:20 and i finally cracked that i cracked it
50:22 yesterday night
50:24 there was no cataclysmic event that
50:26 ended those individuals lives for sure
50:29 unless there's been tremendous global
50:32 meddling
50:33 which is inconceivable given how many
50:37 artifacts of monolithic or megalithic
50:40 construction using superior technology
50:43 to anything we have on earth today
50:46 and here's the way you crack it let's
50:49 say that you and i
50:50 are building something pretty pretty
50:52 cool with the best technology that we
50:54 have
50:55 and there's a cataclysm upon pay um
51:01 well our stuff would be we we would be
51:04 eliminated let's say this
51:06 super you know solar wave thing
51:10 comes out as the galactic super wave
51:13 which is rubbish trust me but we are
51:17 just literally evaporating boom just
51:18 like a
51:19 the x-ray gun from uh attack right
51:23 we cease to exist working out what would
51:25 the world look like
51:26 in our little circle of life let's say
51:29 there's a dozen of us working on
51:31 something
51:33 not only would whatever we're working on
51:35 be frozen in time like an obelisk lying
51:37 on the ground
51:41 but all the tools that we use would be
51:43 also there
51:45 all of them and they would probably be
51:47 in a modern society
51:49 we wouldn't have invented the tools 100
51:52 to such that the rest of
51:53 our fellow citizens didn't have them as
51:55 well imagine a screwdriver
51:57 wasn't something that a post cataclysm
52:00 society could even conceive of
52:04 are you telling me that in a flash of a
52:06 moment a cataclysmic moment when
52:08 all the mega fauna are frozen in time
52:10 with their bellies full of their last
52:12 meal
52:14 that they that we could that the
52:17 establishment
52:18 trying to erase our existence
52:21 would keep whatever we were building but
52:23 they could find every screwdriver
52:25 on earth before anyone else found it
52:28 forever we're talking about think about
52:31 current culture
52:32 where do you keep screwdrivers oh my god
52:35 even if you said well they're generally
52:36 in all the homes but there's some
52:38 hardware stores and some of them are
52:40 stuck in old plymouths out in the middle
52:42 of fields and
52:43 you'd never be able to find them all
52:45 like the photograph
52:46 that kicked off the first episode of
52:49 westworld
52:50 you can't find everything that reveals
52:53 something
52:54 and we haven't found anything it talks
52:56 about the mathematics
52:58 talks about the origins of these people
53:01 i mean if you're willing to take
53:03 at face value say like the book of
53:06 ezekiel
53:07 no you could infer that we definitely
53:09 had some interstellar visitors
53:12 and that's great you've only further
53:14 proven that they existed
53:16 and somehow even they said okay make
53:18 sure you pick up all the stuff we don't
53:19 leave anything behind you know it's the
53:21 first contact prime directive thing
53:25 if you had star trek and if the
53:27 construction sites were small
53:29 and very focused only the giza plateau
53:32 only those three pyramids
53:34 i would say you could probably clean up
53:35 your mess
53:39 but they're everywhere they're
53:41 everywhere we're still finding things
53:44 buried in the ground chambers you know
53:46 if you were to take egypt
53:48 and say everything that was discovered
53:50 pre-dynastic
53:52 had a percentage against everything that
53:53 we think is still buried in the ground
53:56 i think you would have the tip of the
53:58 iceberg i don't know what the percentage
53:59 would be
54:00 but i would say be barely in the double
54:02 digits with the rest of it being buried
54:04 in the
54:05 desert that's what the indications are
54:09 they allow you to go three levels deep
54:11 or you know four levels deep under the
54:12 use of plateau but then they tell you
54:14 there's
54:15 ten other levels well that's fourteen
54:19 so divide four by fourteen that's your
54:21 percentage with the decimal over for the
54:22 actual percentage readout
54:24 okay the overwhelming majority is still
54:28 underground
54:31 for me what i'm seeing in this world
54:35 and when contrasting that with the
54:38 fanciful stories
54:40 why do i get that word from sydney you
54:41 always like to use that word
54:43 the fanciful stories of a god
54:47 of a place like heaven
54:50 what starts to happen is that heaven
54:52 doesn't cease to exist by any means
54:56 because of all the people who have died
54:57 and they literally lift up over the body
54:59 when their body turns to pure light
55:01 they move up not pure light to the human
55:03 being official cortex
55:04 but sort of an energy being probably
55:07 made up of energy that is untrackable by
55:10 monitoring electron patterns or ethereal
55:13 matter
55:15 but we go somewhere and it's because we
55:17 are divorced from our
55:19 our mortal coil we lose all of the aches
55:21 and pains that we might have in our body
55:24 maybe a five-year-old who passes away
55:26 doesn't if they're not tortured
55:28 they simply go to sleep and if they pass
55:31 away in their sleep they never really
55:32 had any pain because their body was
55:33 brand new
55:34 and it's just sort of a very comforting
55:37 transition into dreamland
55:39 but for anyone over 40 we would notice
55:42 right
55:43 get our eyesight back
55:47 but now what if god is in a battle
55:51 and i you know i'm not trying to suggest
55:52 this is something you adopt necessarily
55:56 but he is fighting for you it's romantic
56:00 it's very much like a movie he's the
56:01 hero the devil's the anterior the
56:03 antagonist
56:07 then every day there might be
56:11 something that we can do to empower
56:15 our god what is one of the most
56:17 traditional archetypes
56:18 between man and god inside stories and
56:21 this is sort of a
56:22 way obscure question you if you got the
56:24 answer right it would be amazing
56:27 when i wrote the film koo collin
56:31 for chris hemsworth my story was that
56:37 northern and eastern ireland
56:40 kanak and ulster were going at it
56:43 the annexed exiled
56:47 former queen coming back to wreak havoc
56:50 on her ex-husband the king and lug
56:54 was a god looking down on this world
56:56 saying oh my gosh this is a bad one
56:59 and his wife is like why is this a bad
57:02 one
57:02 can't you just gift them with reason
57:05 and he said i can't do that because then
57:07 they just become puppets
57:09 that's not what they're there for it's
57:10 not how we do it
57:13 and she says well just let them work it
57:14 out we fight on our realm
57:17 they fight on their realm it's just the
57:18 way it is and he says well this one's
57:20 bad
57:21 because she's coming with a gigantic
57:23 army and he's not ready
57:26 so i'm gonna have to do something
57:29 and she says you're too old to go down
57:32 plus you have to run our kingdom
57:34 and she's holding their brand new baby
57:37 and he looks at his wife and he says
57:39 sometimes the gods have to make
57:40 sacrifices too
57:43 and she screams into the night which is
57:45 then overlaid with the virgin birth
57:47 of kukulen the parable is
57:51 that we have to believe in the gods
57:53 otherwise they don't exist
57:58 it could be in some crude fashion that
58:00 we are all made of the same soul energy
58:02 and if we privilege loyalty
58:04 to a particular being that has our best
58:06 interest
58:07 slash just straight up common law make
58:09 it easy on your mind
58:13 that we empower god we devote ourselves
58:17 almost like in the movie tron where you
58:20 send your power cycles
58:21 to a program that makes them more
58:23 powerful they can do more things the
58:25 higher vibrations therefore
58:28 their army to fight the darkness
58:32 bruce campbell comes to mind
58:35 they have the ability to win
58:39 and what if it's just that simple
58:42 what if it's just that simple if you
58:45 cease believing in a god
58:47 and you can call them jesus if you like
58:49 i support you either way
58:52 there's no one on earth would probably
58:54 love to meet that guy than me
58:56 and have him be real be great i know his
58:59 whole life story
59:04 if you cease to believe then that god
59:06 gets deprecated you
59:07 pull the blood supply out of that god
59:09 and therefore
59:11 he she it cannot fight on your behalf
59:16 and because we know that the devil has a
59:18 foothold
59:19 in this world and that's just a metaphor
59:21 for some and it could be a very literal
59:22 thing for others
59:25 but he just gets more powerful
59:29 is it easier to build a house of cards
59:31 or knock a house of cards down
59:34 well it's obviously to destroy things
59:36 it's a feeble mind that finds
59:38 satisfaction and destruction
59:41 we watch nascar for the accidents we
59:43 watch formula one for the accidents
59:47 because there's something in us that has
59:50 a fascination with destruction
59:52 how many you've ever watched a war
59:55 movie where it is actually the videos on
59:58 the vehicles that are killing people on
60:01 the ground
60:02 the a-10 warthogs the apache helicopters
60:05 the flying fortresses
60:07 and we see what we believe to be the bad
60:09 guys the people actually
60:10 live there we've come from 8 000 miles
60:13 away and we
60:14 are just liquefying these human beings
60:17 we see their bodies flying a bunch of
60:19 pieces in these
60:20 hot little pockets everywhere and we're
60:22 like yes this is awesome our side's
60:25 winning the bad guys are losing
60:29 why do we believe that because somebody
60:33 told us
60:34 they're bad and we're good now they're
60:37 bad people well sure
60:39 the more you piss people off they're
60:41 going to want to hurt you
60:42 to defend themselves and then
60:46 we will be right in doing so
60:51 at one point in my life i was very close
60:53 to artificial intelligence programmers
60:55 who were dealing with
60:57 military
61:00 in space
61:03 and they are putting things in space
61:05 that can attack the ground
61:07 similar to war games okay
61:11 so there's ai in space that has the
61:14 ability to potentially launch
61:17 missile from space down to earth to
61:21 avoid a war
61:23 and the artificial intelligence has been
61:25 imbued in some cases with complete
61:27 autonomy
61:29 it sits and thinks about war and its
61:31 objective
61:32 all day long and you know what the
61:35 biggest struggle for those programmers
61:37 were
61:38 if they wrote a line of code wrong
61:42 then that satellite could get to a point
61:44 where it is thinking about this so much
61:46 and it says well
61:48 if i am supposed to stop a war and kill
61:51 that particular
61:52 enemy and this is my home i protect this
61:55 i
61:56 kill those people then maybe if i launch
61:59 my missiles first i can annihilate the
62:01 enemy before they ever kill the planet
62:04 or our sorry our country and therefore
62:07 we win launch
62:11 and that was the biggest problem of
62:14 creating
62:16 star wars not the movie but the array of
62:19 satellites in space that was deployed in
62:20 late 80s
62:22 and then they told the world it wasn't
62:23 deployed at all and it was cancelled
62:25 okay it's the chicken and egg problem
62:29 right
62:30 and we know this exists all around the
62:32 world i
62:35 utterly cannot explain the last four
62:37 weeks of my life
62:39 in terms of the awakening
62:45 again females i mean i don't know
62:48 how i could ever say it on this show
62:50 without you
62:51 laughing at me that i'm going to say
62:53 okay god ladies and gentlemen because i
62:55 did not have this epiphany
62:57 this is just me simulating what i've
62:59 experienced but imagine me four weeks
63:01 ago telling you folks
63:03 okay here's what's gonna happen guys all
63:05 the women in america
63:06 who are massive liberal democrats you
63:10 hate your guts if you're center to right
63:13 if you believe in common law they hate
63:15 you
63:16 they're all going to see something and
63:18 they're going to wake up
63:20 now they're not all waking up but you
63:23 know
63:23 i mean i don't talk to that many
63:26 external females
63:27 right it's all coming through like a few
63:29 resources someone's wife
63:31 uh a girl's best friends you know that
63:33 kind of thing
63:36 but they're waking up in droves i love
63:39 it i can't even believe it q's barely
63:41 doing anything and these people are
63:42 still waking up
63:43 the information's out there and they're
63:46 brilliant people
63:47 who are going after real resources and
63:50 the women seem to be more
63:52 prone to do their research than men
63:55 so that's beautiful i don't know if you
63:58 know this but when they were creating
64:00 the
64:01 the helmets for the apache helicopter
64:03 the story i heard and
64:05 was that they were trying to simulate
64:07 you know use voices
64:08 computer control voices to tell the
64:10 pilots you know you're flying too low
64:12 pull up you know this missile is being
64:15 launched this missile is armed all those
64:16 different messages they were getting
64:17 from the computer
64:19 and apparently they attempted to do a
64:22 male voice thinking a male
64:23 pilot would respond better to a male
64:25 voice
64:26 and what they found and i do not know
64:28 how this worked
64:30 but they realized that a female voice
64:31 had more power over the male
64:33 maybe a maternal mother him sort of
64:37 thing
64:38 and now everything that you ever see is
64:39 a woman telling you
64:41 to pull up now i definitely have played
64:43 some uh plane simulation games where
64:45 it's still a guy
64:46 but in war i've always heard a female
64:49 voice
64:51 it's more powerful it's interesting
64:56 i think in these bizarre times i mean
65:00 what's what's a real bummer
65:04 is that we've had a lot of tough years
65:05 right and it's bizarre how our mind will
65:08 look at a number
65:10 and kind of feel a certain way about a
65:12 number right 2019
65:15 the only people that had a warm fuzzy
65:16 about 2019 were those of us who liked
65:18 the movie blade runner
65:21 i lost one of my best friends in the
65:22 whole world in 2019
65:24 but he wasn't a young man he lived a
65:26 good life
65:28 but 2020 when it came around the corner
65:32 i think nearly all my friends who are of
65:34 that level to
65:36 register a number making them feel
65:38 better we all sat around me literally
65:40 we sat around at home in january and
65:43 everybody said i think this is going to
65:44 be a really good year yeah me too man it
65:46 just feels right right yeah 2020 so it's
65:48 a clean number
65:51 and then a group of people in the world
65:52 decided to make it
65:54 horrible it's not the worst it could be
65:58 but they have robbed millions
66:01 of business owners from their business
66:04 utterly and completely gutted these
66:06 businesses that will never ever return
66:10 children around the world aren't getting
66:12 educated properly
66:14 they've now done studies to where to
66:16 figure out whether or not the kids even
66:18 retained enough information
66:19 to pass the previous grade and now they
66:23 truly believe that in fall of this year
66:25 2020
66:26 we're going to have tens of millions if
66:29 not hundreds of millions of children
66:31 absolutely ill-prepared
66:34 for the next year they didn't take the
66:37 test they were supposed to take they
66:38 didn't retain the information
66:41 some of their parents are trying to
66:42 scare them to death if they're going to
66:43 die if they walk outside
66:46 we've now seen celebrities show their
66:49 true colors
66:51 celebrities that know all about child
66:52 trafficking and aren't celebrating any
66:54 of these people getting caught
66:56 which means they're involved one way or
66:58 the other by proxy or direct
67:02 we see celebrities that don't have two
67:04 brain cells to rub together when it
67:05 comes to analyzing science
67:08 but they're out there telling you how to
67:09 live your life as if you need their
67:11 opinion as if you care about their pain
67:14 as if they're going to come to your
67:15 house and dinner with you if you do
67:16 exactly what they say
67:19 it's interesting if there's any truth
67:24 to the fact that truth itself comes to
67:28 man in many methodologies
67:33 then there seems to be this overwhelming
67:37 desire for man to believe in a higher
67:40 being
67:42 and not out of a servitude necessarily
67:45 although
67:45 there's tens of millions if not billions
67:47 of people that take it to that level
67:49 again would you ever want your child to
67:52 come back to your house every sunday
67:54 and worship you and just you know clean
67:57 your feet
67:57 suck on your toes no you wouldn't
68:00 go live your own life please come over
68:02 to eat dinner i'd love to ask you how
68:03 your life is doing
68:05 but i'm here to support you but you have
68:06 to make your own decisions you're your
68:08 own person
68:10 time to get hard there's the sofa right
68:11 there's your old bedroom okay
68:14 the worship is the need of a
68:18 absolute childish narcissist and i
68:20 really doubt that's the way god would
68:22 roll if god exists
68:25 but maybe the only thing god needs is to
68:27 be believed in
68:28 to have power to align
68:33 now will evil ever cease to exist
68:36 probably not
68:38 but can't we cling to the notion that
68:40 there was truly a god that is
68:43 perfect and incapable of being in sin
68:46 and he maintains the universe he being
68:48 metaphorical of course
68:52 then he couldn't have a backpack that he
68:55 carries which is our universe that's
68:56 full of
68:57 absolute horrors beyond the wildest
69:00 dreams of
69:02 most modern mortal men and women
69:07 but the second you were to imagine that
69:08 god's fighting a war just like you fight
69:10 a war
69:11 you're fighting for your income you're
69:13 fighting for your life
69:15 the mob rules is destroying the planet
69:18 and because we looked the other way
69:20 while television and the internet was
69:22 making everybody stupid
69:24 while colleges ceased to create degrees
69:26 that are employable with any trade
69:28 skills
69:29 we kept looking the other way looking
69:30 the other way the whole time
69:33 and it's all come to fruition
69:37 2020 has taken
69:40 everyone and beautifully exposed them
69:42 like cockroaches
69:44 in some cases exposed them as absolutely
69:47 mentally ill human beings
69:50 and really revealed a lot of the
69:52 weaknesses within people
69:55 someone walking around trying to tell
69:56 someone how to be in public
69:59 during this situation that we're in
70:02 screaming and yelling at someone when
70:04 they have taken opportunities to protect
70:06 themselves their own philosophy
70:11 they revealed themselves to be
70:12 petty-minded low-iq
70:14 low vibration human beings that if they
70:18 contribute to society at all it would be
70:20 only for their own
70:21 gain which is most likely based on greed
70:25 based on insecurities
70:29 to feed the reflection of their face in
70:31 the water
70:33 but i'm willing to bet most these people
70:36 hate
70:36 reflective surfaces i just truly believe
70:40 that
70:42 so when it comes to faith from
70:45 man to a god like entity any
70:49 version of that you're a christian
70:52 you're a hardcore christian are you just
70:53 a human being who believes in a
70:55 spiritual higher being
70:59 there's a sort of this in-game comfort
71:02 that we get out of it well at least
71:04 after this
71:06 this uh poop show that we're in is over
71:09 hopefully gets better before we all pass
71:12 but if it does truly go into the hands
71:13 of these absolute psychopaths
71:16 at the end of it at least we ascend to a
71:18 place was no pain
71:20 knowledge is abundant creativity is our
71:22 very
71:23 nature love is the only fabric of our
71:27 universe once we go outside these
71:30 confined ethereal walls
71:33 maybe it is that way but as prince said
71:37 let's go crazy the opening of his lyrics
71:39 he goes but in this life
71:41 you're on your own so we have to get in
71:44 the purple elevator that's what we have
71:45 to do right
71:48 punch a higher floor
71:52 now just prior to this year
71:56 which gave abject morons the excuse to
71:59 get in your face
72:01 and try to interfere with your life
72:03 which is absolutely a pure violation of
72:05 common law
72:07 they want to do you harm they want to do
72:09 you harm out of
72:10 complete stupidity and they want to do
72:12 you harm if you don't follow their
72:13 complete stupidity
72:15 okay but before that we had what
72:19 philosophy
72:20 to get free of the craziness
72:24 you turn off your tv you turn off
72:27 the internet as it relates to television
72:30 the indoctrination
72:31 tube that uh what is it frank zappa
72:35 he's got that beautiful photographer
72:36 he's a toilet linked to a tv
72:39 beautiful shot i'll try to find it it's
72:40 been posted a couple times on the d
72:42 thoughts radio facebook page
72:43 brilliant it said he was way ahead of
72:47 its time
72:48 right but last year we could just
72:50 disengage
72:52 and then create a microcosm of
72:53 intelligence
72:55 surrounding ourselves with other deep
72:56 thoughts listeners and other brilliant
72:58 people
73:00 and we could kind of create a beautiful
73:02 sort of um
73:04 perhaps reality distortion field pure
73:06 positivity creativity enlightenment
73:09 but now in 2020 the folks
73:13 from the agenda 21
73:16 who've had this plan the entire time
73:18 right all of this stuff has been planned
73:20 forever
73:21 and a friend of mine um who just woke up
73:25 she collects trading cards of all kinds
73:28 and she is trying to track down the
73:30 trading cards that were made in 1994
73:33 that are basically it's called the
73:35 illuminati cards and they predicted
73:37 911 then the world trade centers were on
73:40 fire
73:42 i forgot she listed a whole litany of
73:43 things including the virus and a bunch
73:45 of other stuff
73:47 so this is all planned people not
73:49 exactly how it happens when it happens
73:52 those are details that are sorted out
73:53 the closer they get to the event
73:55 right so we are
73:58 sort of at a battle right now
74:02 there's a lot of folks intelligently
74:04 saying and this
74:05 i want you to understand this has been
74:07 said before
74:09 back when the united states of america
74:11 lost control of its money in 1913 with
74:14 a with a falsely ratified slashed
74:17 approved 16th amendment
74:22 there were senators screaming
74:25 and an economist screaming at the united
74:28 states citizens to say
74:30 do not pass that which is why they
74:33 didn't
74:33 which is why at least three or four
74:35 states were held at gunpoint on
74:37 christmas eve
74:38 to pass it and of course then the hearst
74:39 corporation started printing the press
74:41 that we did approve it
74:42 woodrow wilson which was a complete
74:44 [ __ ] sold us out and taft the first
74:46 golem bones president
74:48 knew exactly what was happening his
74:50 buddy philander knox
74:52 which is what fort knox is named after
74:55 despite any stories you're told
74:57 went around on a caboose and told the
74:58 world that something great had happened
75:02 the people thought they were sticking it
75:03 to the corporations and
75:05 they got stabbed in the back so we have
75:08 been here before
75:09 several times with all kinds of things
75:11 where the demise of our country
75:13 was being echoed right in your face
75:16 for those of you remember the election
75:18 of 1992 where bill clinton snuck into
75:20 the
75:21 white house with a minority vote meaning
75:24 you've got the least amount of votes
75:26 ross perot gave it to bill clinton
75:31 but he was telling you that nafta was
75:33 the worst thing
75:34 that ever happened of course ross
75:37 screwed up by
75:39 running and then pulling out and running
75:41 again what an idiot
75:43 but he was telling you nafta was going
75:45 to kill america then he said the sucking
75:48 sound he's going to suck all the jobs
75:49 out of america and what happened
75:51 three decades later our current
75:54 president's going yeah
75:55 that's why i canceled it that's why tpp
75:58 got cancelled
76:00 look what happened to all of your jobs
76:03 ross perot told you
76:04 but everyone ignored him because they're
76:07 abject morons
76:09 and this is about to happen in 2020 if
76:11 we don't get control
76:13 over virtually every aspect
76:16 of our respective countries
76:21 kanye west said something on tmz
76:26 because he recently did his presidential
76:28 um announcement
76:29 which was a train wreck of all train
76:31 wrecks
76:32 but he said something that is very
76:35 offensive if you take it a particular
76:37 way but if you try to get behind what he
76:38 was saying
76:40 it echoes to what's going on now let's
76:42 give an example
76:44 they we're talking about slavery again
76:47 he's in a privileged state of being a
76:49 multi-multi-millionaire according to him
76:51 he's a billionaire but no one seems to
76:52 know it in the financial districts
76:55 but we'll let him live in the world that
76:56 he's in
76:59 but he said you know slavery went on for
77:00 400 years in america he goes 400 years
77:04 because the sir sure sounds like a
77:06 choice to me
77:08 what is he saying because people like
77:10 what are you talking about
77:13 what he's saying is why didn't you all
77:16 rise up
77:17 grab your picks and your shovels
77:20 and you'll kill the plantation owners
77:23 one at a time
77:24 just kill them all just
77:27 what are they going to do you got a
77:29 hundred guys on a field
77:31 you kill anybody who's watching you then
77:33 you kill everybody who's in the house
77:34 then you just move the next house then
77:36 you get another 100 guys now you have
77:37 200.
77:38 then 300 if you just never stop you're
77:40 just going to waste them all
77:41 that's what he was saying but of course
77:45 he said it on tmz which is uh
77:49 probably the epicenter of mental illness
77:51 on planet earth
77:55 but now i watch videos
77:58 this is happening in america but it's a
78:00 little more
78:01 difficult to put together in america
78:04 except for the
78:05 family in missouri i believe it was the
78:07 defender their home with guns and they
78:08 had their guns confiscated now they're
78:10 being charged
78:11 for their constitutional rights and our
78:13 president just sits on the sidelines
78:14 going well whatever
78:17 but in england for the last geez
78:20 at least 10 years of youtube we are
78:23 seeing police officers come to residence
78:26 and harass residents against their
78:28 rights
78:29 of free speech
78:32 and somehow i've got friends of mine who
78:34 are brilliant british people
78:36 and they're sitting there telling me i
78:38 can't understand it
78:40 and most these people do resist at the
78:42 door
78:43 but their government which has a group
78:46 of people
78:47 that cannot be charged with anything
78:49 right prince andrew technically cannot
78:51 be charged in his country for
78:52 any crime that's just the law and every
78:55 single country that has
78:57 the queen's face on their money come on
79:00 does that seem a little strange canada
79:02 and australia maybe new zealand i don't
79:04 know
79:04 new zealand's money but i'm sure it does
79:06 i think hong kong still has some
79:08 or her face on the money maybe not
79:10 anymore but it did
79:14 prince andrew was sleeping with underage
79:16 girls over and over and over again he's
79:18 never getting
79:18 charged it can't be charged unless the
79:20 thing changes
79:22 all right well what if he did some other
79:25 super duper horrible stuff
79:26 you still can't charge him he could do
79:28 it on tv just like the first episode of
79:30 black mirror
79:31 instead of a pig could have been a kid
79:33 you can't do anything
79:34 because you've allowed your country to
79:36 have that situation
79:39 now in america we do forbid charges to
79:41 be pushed against the acting president
79:43 but we can arrest that dude the second
79:44 he gets out of office
79:47 okay i technically speaking in america
79:51 um we'd probably lynch anybody who did
79:53 anything horrific in front of us right
79:58 but so the police of scotland yard i
79:59 guess that's what it is
80:02 they are out of control in england you
80:04 have no more rights
80:06 you're living in the first stages of a
80:09 totalitarian return
80:11 because england as far as i know had the
80:14 most sophisticated society on planet
80:16 earth
80:18 say 500 years ago but also had the most
80:21 intense
80:21 multi-layered tyranny of anywhere on
80:24 earth
80:25 ever meaning yes there was more
80:28 draconian things happening in different
80:29 places on earth than previous time sets
80:31 but imagine this you're super
80:33 intelligent as a race
80:34 as a people right all different cultures
80:37 but
80:38 you're super sophisticated and you still
80:40 couldn't
80:41 say a stamp tax was a bad thing
80:44 so a bunch of people fled over here to
80:46 america set to join up
80:47 put a bunch of stuff in place and we're
80:50 jerks for having
80:51 those rights
80:56 everywhere on planet earth the guns have
80:58 been taken away tyranny returns
81:01 england to being one of them okay and
81:04 they want to come over and take the guns
81:05 from america
81:06 last place on earth with a super
81:08 sophisticated society
81:10 high vibration people want to take it
81:12 away
81:13 so boom it's gone
81:16 now returning back to the celestial
81:20 realm of consciousness
81:25 i think we are on our own a hundred
81:27 percent
81:30 but just like the story of zeus with the
81:32 story of lug
81:34 from kukulen
81:38 isn't it interesting when you pray to a
81:39 god i mean genuinely so
81:43 results typically happen it's a wild
81:46 thing
81:48 maybe it's a direct relationship that we
81:50 have with our god he's actually
81:52 listening he's like i got a red phone
81:53 for you
81:54 but if you don't call it i don't do
81:55 anything just my policy
81:58 because you calling means that you
81:59 acknowledge me thus you have faith in me
82:01 thus you
82:02 empower me with your loyalty
82:05 it's not that i'm trying to control you
82:06 or manipulate you it's just
82:08 the way the universe is hooked up maybe
82:10 god even inherited the fabric of his
82:12 world
82:14 just the way it is i didn't decide to
82:17 make it that way
82:20 but it could be simply law of attraction
82:22 or manifest destiny
82:24 another built-in power of human
82:26 consciousness the more elevated you are
82:28 as a human being
82:29 the more your tendricals of thought and
82:32 decisive
82:34 decision-making towards a particular
82:36 goal gives you
82:37 that goal i told you guys a long time
82:40 ago a friend of mine needed
82:42 ten thousand dollars
82:46 maybe he was a thousand bucks can't
82:47 remember but i said to her i said look
82:49 just the fact is she was sweating over
82:50 it and i said look just the fact that
82:52 you can conceive that you need the money
82:54 cuts the difficulty in half because if
82:55 you didn't know you needed it but you
82:57 needed it
82:57 you'd never get it and whatever slings
82:59 and arrows as a result of not having
83:00 that money
83:01 it's going to hit you in the face so now
83:03 you know now you can hustle
83:05 so maybe you don't get all the money but
83:06 whatever money you're able to get in a
83:08 short period of time is enough to
83:09 satiate your debtor
83:11 maybe they'll leave you alone i think
83:14 that might be the way the universe works
83:16 for us
83:19 there's the old adage that what you put
83:21 out is what you get back
83:24 well part of that's just a benign
83:26 statement to say i put positivity out to
83:28 get positivity back but what if it's
83:30 a well-crafted goal
83:33 becomes manifest
83:37 i know that most of you if not every
83:39 single one of you do this anyway
83:42 all i'm doing is sort of adding a little
83:43 context at best
83:46 to the arguments within our mind that
83:48 might
83:50 inhibit our ability to believe that
83:52 these
83:53 commitments and these acts actually work
84:00 i want you to believe in yourself and
84:02 your ability to do something and that's
84:03 sort of like that
84:05 little pep talk thing that might last a
84:06 split second and i leave the room and
84:08 then
84:09 you go back to your doubting
84:13 enlightenment is very difficult to
84:15 reverse
84:17 a friend of mine said an absolutely
84:19 brilliant thing the other day and this
84:20 is something i encourage all of you
84:22 to say to yourself and to other people
84:26 she said i don't know a single person
84:29 that has been
84:30 red pilled we turned back to the blue
84:32 pill
84:36 like the dude matrix wanted to go back
84:38 never seen it before
84:40 because typically the red pill involves
84:42 you seeing things that cannot be unseen
84:45 and that is the purest definition
84:48 of enlightenment and you
84:51 are enlightened you are or you wouldn't
84:54 last this long
84:55 on this show and you certainly wouldn't
84:58 be a regular
84:59 listener understand that you can design
85:02 your life
85:05 i had a friend of mine i talked to today
85:08 and he sort of has an interesting
85:12 sort of i guess uh
85:16 self-deprecating personality he's very
85:18 much aware of it he was communicating to
85:20 me
85:21 but as he gets older he thinks he he
85:24 essentially goes back
85:26 to his past and he compounds the impact
85:28 of the negative things that he
85:30 experienced so to put that in an easier
85:33 term
85:34 if he thought that a mistake he made in
85:36 1990 was a
85:37 was a four today in 2020 he'll upgrade
85:41 the four to a six
85:42 and then perhaps 2021 i'll make the six
85:44 at eight
85:45 so it just seems like it's an
85:46 overwhelming oh my gosh what have i done
85:49 with my life sort of
85:50 perspective
85:53 and of course we talk and i do what i do
85:57 and i played a reflection session to
85:59 them and then i started putting my own
86:00 dna in there a little bit
86:03 because we're we're within about five
86:05 years of each other's age
86:07 he's a little bit older than me
86:10 but i just kept telling him i said well
86:12 that thing i've experienced too and you
86:14 know what it wasn't my fault and it's
86:15 not your fault just happened
86:18 he tried to lean back on the fact that
86:19 it was something that he did that made
86:21 something occur and i kept arguing with
86:23 him
86:24 without arguing necessarily but i said
86:25 well i don't think that's the case man
86:27 i mean what about this what about that
86:29 did you have control then well there's
86:31 other things i could have done
86:33 so i said well so what you're trying to
86:35 do is live an absolutely perfect life
86:38 where you have no regrets
86:42 well you'd be the rarest human being on
86:43 planet earth that was the case
86:48 and finally he stood up
86:52 because he had to go get something and
86:54 he's like you know
86:56 because i'm sorry i'm in this mood and
86:58 he goes yeah he goes you know i just
86:59 he needed a vent he needed to say those
87:03 words so he could hear them and make
87:04 sure that he agreed with them and i
87:06 think in the end
87:08 i don't think he agreed with much of
87:09 what he was saying but he needed to vent
87:11 that
87:11 because that was a little loopy negative
87:14 frequency inside of his chest
87:17 the one thing that i have found about
87:19 the belief in a god
87:22 is that i do have the sense almost like
87:25 a sixth sense that there is a god
87:26 and i think most of us have gone through
87:29 that even if you return back to atheism
87:31 you've considered it at least right
87:33 those of you are very devout to that
87:35 belief system and you know again it
87:38 could be
87:38 purely scientific for those of you who
87:40 are atheists it could just simply be the
87:43 central
87:44 computing force of of the universe
87:47 itself the mathematics that holds the
87:49 universe together
87:52 but what i have found is when i
87:54 concentrate on that force
87:57 regardless if i'm asking for something
87:59 in return
88:00 for my time spent speaking to that being
88:04 or just saying thanks
88:07 there's like a coolness that comes over
88:10 my being
88:13 doesn't mean all of a sudden everything
88:15 gets fixed
88:16 but it's like my friend if she didn't
88:18 conceive of needing the money she was
88:19 never going to get it
88:22 and maybe if we don't conceive of what
88:24 we need to change
88:26 or what should change in this universe
88:29 it's never gonna happen how could it
88:33 be just like some weird miracle where
88:34 everything just went click and everyone
88:36 woke up the next day and was different
88:39 wouldn't that be a cool movie one person
88:43 one person didn't click one cynical
88:45 person
88:46 was left over looking at the universe
88:48 and going how are you guys all happy i'm
88:50 not happy
88:51 sort of like that uh twilight zone about
88:54 mind over matter
88:57 the thread came out of the sweater and i
88:58 had to pull it before the final episode
89:01 just gonna keep doing these things man
89:04 anyway let me know what you think
89:06 in the comments below and please visit
89:10 deepthoughtsradio.com we have two major
89:12 arteries for video
89:13 youtube and bid shoot but shoots working
89:15 pretty great
89:16 sometimes it takes like three days to
89:18 encode a video
89:21 we have all the audio you could possibly
89:22 want from google to apple to whatever
89:25 generic device you have get right off
89:27 the website
89:29 we have five social media now
89:32 i would say the most important two
89:36 would be our locked facebook group and
89:38 it is locked
89:39 so that when you post your private
89:41 thoughts it's locked away from anyone
89:43 else that
89:44 could critique you within your circle so
89:46 you know people can look up your
89:47 activity on facebook and that
89:49 your activity on this show's page won't
89:53 show up
89:53 so you have your own private projected
89:55 thing and this is the greatest
89:56 group of people ever i mean
90:00 we had a giant group of people january
90:02 1st 2020
90:04 but i also had a giant group of friends
90:06 in los angeles
90:07 in january 1st 2020 and what's the
90:09 difference
90:10 in july of 2020 a lot of my friends in
90:13 real life have turned into complete
90:16 blankety blanks and the people on
90:18 facebook have kept it
90:20 so cool and it's just like a great oasis
90:23 to be in so if you're not a part of that
90:24 facebook group and you do have a
90:25 facebook account
90:27 you definitely want to get up there and
90:29 click the link the other one
90:32 i do twitter i'm tweeting more so if you
90:35 guys are into that
90:36 which i kind of loathe the platform but
90:38 i kind of get in there just because you
90:39 have to put your skin in the game
90:41 the other one is mines.com which is a
90:43 brand new facebook competitor
90:46 there's gab.com it's a facebook
90:48 competitor but it's really behind the
90:49 times
90:50 and then there's parlor which is just a
90:53 really bizarre
90:55 thing it's very inconsistent in its
90:58 behavior
90:58 i paste usually a video url and it gives
91:01 you a preview down below
91:02 this last two videos it's just the url
91:05 nothing i can do to make it sexy
91:07 very sad so mines.com has got its act
91:10 together and i think it's gorgeous
91:12 this can't you can't customize it a
91:13 whole bunch but it's really cool
91:16 there are two ways to donate to the page
91:19 and
91:20 in these intense times i can't even
91:23 believe it but you guys have pushed the
91:24 patreon over 100 bucks
91:26 so super appreciate that it does help
91:28 man
91:29 it does help sorry i just super
91:31 appreciate that
91:33 and there's also paypal which i think
91:35 you have the
91:36 choice of making it anonymous so
91:39 if you want to just completely hide but
91:41 contribute to the show that's another
91:42 way
91:43 we also have a store with shirts and
91:45 again i'm working on some new ones
91:47 i just got a really good idea yesterday
91:49 for sure finally got this
91:51 thing put together i wanted to create a
91:52 funny shirt that would be cool for the
91:54 show brand
91:55 so that'll be coming out in the next
91:56 month or so
91:58 we also have a remastered season one
92:01 because of music issues and copyright
92:03 issues a bunch of videos were not
92:05 visible on this particular channel so
92:07 instead of
92:08 uploading 100 new remastered episodes
92:11 and weird
92:12 sequences screwing up all the numbers i
92:14 pushed it off to its own channel
92:15 both are demonetized one was never
92:17 monetized this was demonetized and i
92:19 want to say
92:20 the episode that got us demonetized the
92:22 moment it passed around
92:23 with the adage that it was demonetized
92:26 this video was so hot
92:28 that it demonetized the entire channel
92:30 was episode 498
92:32 if that ever gets pulled off and i can't
92:34 believe they didn't kill it
92:36 it's going to be on bed shoot obviously
92:37 so anything that gets killed that we
92:39 want to keep
92:41 i'll change the website to reflect that
92:43 the website has every episode on there
92:45 that we haven't retired which is very
92:47 few but i did get rid of all the corona
92:50 stuff because it's just all
92:51 late inaccurate information speculation
92:54 so anywho thanks for joining the show
92:59 take care of yourself and someone else
93:00 and i will see you on the next
93:02 deep thoughts over now
93:13 [Applause]
93:20 [Applause]
93:26 [Applause]
93:43 you
