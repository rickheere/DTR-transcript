00:35 so I have all these ideas for episodes
00:38 on my mind I thought about brewing up
00:42 another moon hoax episode which I think
00:44 I will not quite ready for all the
00:48 angles and factoids I want to share and
00:52 I think that one that's starting to dawn
00:56 on me that I think I need to go through
00:58 which will be sort of an extension of
01:01 the gravity episode this is not going to
01:05 catch people's minds right away but
01:08 those of you who've searched on YouTube
01:10 and you found this episode where you
01:12 searched on Google or whatever I think
01:15 you'll be pleased with whoever going
01:19 here I'm calling this ether winds in my
01:24 brain maybe I changed the name before it
01:27 comes out but it dawned on me the other
01:31 day when I was thinking about time
01:33 travel and it has to do with the the
01:39 Twilight Zone episode with burgess
01:41 meredith where he is at a actually i
01:46 have to say take that back he's in a
01:48 different episode there's another
01:50 gentleman where he is sort of a a bit of
01:53 a loudmouth he talks a lot it's sort of
01:55 annoying nerd guy brilliantly played by
01:57 the secretary finds out what episode
01:59 Damon is and he ends up kind of losing
02:04 his job losing his friends and he ends
02:07 up at a bar talking to a foreign guy and
02:10 with this pretty much his last money he
02:13 buys this guy a beer
02:14 and the guy's touched and he says okay I
02:17 want to give you a gift for buying me
02:20 this beer and he gives him a stopwatch
02:24 and he's like ooh why do you have a
02:26 stopwatch
02:27 what are you timing because you know
02:28 back in those days they only did one
02:30 thing they just started and stopped and
02:33 you could take a look someone have to
02:34 have a special job obviously he says
02:37 well you know you'll see it's a special
02:38 stopwatch okay great guy leaves he's
02:42 kind of drunk the guy that gave him the
02:45 stopwatch the dude who gets the
02:47 stopwatch she starts messing around and
02:49 hits it as soon as he hit stop I guess
02:54 it's the stop with a star not sure but
02:56 the guy owns a place freezes and time
02:59 stops and then he can do things around
03:03 the room and then hit it again and it
03:06 starts again and anyone anyone else but
03:09 him they don't see it they're actually
03:10 paused in time but he can accomplish a
03:12 bunch of things in that time frame and
03:15 that got me thinking now if you've
03:18 watched every single episode which only
03:21 a few of you have you know I'm a big
03:23 proponent of ether winds because once I
03:25 had it explained to me gravity was
03:27 immediately explained which is something
03:29 I've struggled with my entire lifetime I
03:32 mean I've spent 15 years trying to find
03:34 a unified theory to the universe
03:36 bouncing it off of amazing minds but it
03:40 never made sense I came up with an idea
03:42 and it you know it kind of it kind of
03:43 works in a frequency based universe but
03:45 it's just wasn't missing this underlying
03:48 thing physics always welcomes you to the
03:50 club of completely [ __ ] confused and
03:52 don't know anything right and the reason
03:55 why is that that's their job the
03:58 founding members of physics were
04:00 chartered to mess up your mind and close
04:03 it and keep you lost by the bankers that
04:08 funded the physicists I mean think about
04:10 it they sit around just do nothing right
04:12 I wrote an equation on a board million
04:15 dollars in the name of academia of
04:18 accomplishing nothing that's not love
04:20 about it a little bit CERN is a this
04:24 proof that all this was worthwhile okay
04:27 once you learn about ether it's mind
04:30 blowing yes there are [ __ ]
04:34 experiments that Michelson experiment to
04:36 supposedly prove that ether doesn't
04:38 exist go research that one okay just
04:42 look up the fraud of the Michelson
04:44 experiment and you will see there's a
04:47 couple beautiful YouTube videos out
04:48 there if a guy that really broke down
04:53 the setup of the experiment and then the
04:55 fudged results and it's an experiment
05:00 that completely misunderstands every
05:02 single thing about ether and then
05:04 creates an experiment around it you know
05:07 it'd be like someone trying to become a
05:09 plumber you know controlling water right
05:12 that's the plumbers do they have a
05:13 source they have a way to route it they
05:15 have all kinds of utilities that could
05:16 be attached to a pipe a faucet shower or
05:19 whatever a tank accept this particular
05:22 group of plumbers who created the
05:24 Michelson experiment we're trying to
05:26 trying to use sand instead of pipes and
05:30 if that sounds insane then you now you
05:33 know what the Michelson experiments all
05:35 about they thought they could control
05:37 the the flow of ether particles they
05:41 thought that they had the they built
05:45 these tubes that were supposed to absorb
05:47 ether particles and it's just insane
05:51 they didn't understand that you throw
05:53 particles and ether winds go through all
05:55 things that we've been able to find the
05:57 only thing that can repel in a
05:59 dielectric magnet manner ether winds as
06:02 ether right that's where dielectric
06:05 energy comes from
06:06 it's where dialectic was a dielectric
06:10 repulsion and from magnets you know like
06:13 a living object if you put a magnet
06:15 against it it will the waves coming off
06:19 the magnet will bounce off of organic
06:20 flesh because it is a chaotic wind of a
06:25 cat a collection of winds that make up
06:27 all the atoms that make up organic life
06:29 the reason why you can take you know a
06:32 magnet up to something that's magnetic
06:34 and it automatically goes BAM and slams
06:36 together is because it's a unified
06:39 crystalline structure
06:40 which makes it a metal okay we're gonna
06:43 just go all over the place with this
06:45 theory so you can kind of see hopefully
06:48 through many examples what the hell I'm
06:51 talking about I used to fix VCRs when I
06:53 was a kid my father taught me
06:56 he was always building electronic heath
06:58 kits
06:59 you know televisions and amplifiers and
07:01 all kinds of wild stuff so I got to
07:02 learn electronics that are very early
07:04 age by the age of 17 I had enrolled in a
07:09 robotics course through the mail which
07:11 taught me the rest of electronics I just
07:14 bought a robot kit today
07:15 was on sale but there's an analogy
07:19 inside a VCR that will make sense to
07:21 what I'm going to talk about today which
07:23 is pausing time isn't that haven't you
07:26 guys once ever thought about what it
07:28 would be like to pause time you watch
07:30 that that Twilight Zone episode you're
07:32 like man that'd be cool I could pause
07:33 time and smooch a girl's steal some
07:37 money to have a car real fast but how
07:41 would you do that how would you take
07:42 everything and hold it in position well
07:47 when you used to run old VCR with tapes
07:49 VHS beta tapes doesn't matter there's
07:51 this drum in there that spins and
07:54 electronics companies love moving parts
07:57 because moving parts break right when
07:59 the digital you know RAM sticks came out
08:03 they hated them because they didn't
08:05 break right so they messed with the
08:08 batteries right the batteries are always
08:10 the things they [ __ ] up on you okay
08:12 that's the renewal mechanism that's the
08:14 obsolete mechanism but when you pause
08:16 the tape I don't know what it about
08:19 thing was the tape stops advancing
08:23 through the cassette from one reel to
08:25 the other reel and now it's sitting
08:26 against the head the head is rotating
08:29 and they had to have these little tiny
08:30 dashes in it which is where the actual
08:33 data readers come in and used to always
08:36 hear this stuff for those of you are my
08:37 age or older you're gonna laugh your
08:38 head off but it got to the point where
08:41 we started out with a single head then a
08:44 double head then it caught a triple head
08:46 and this kept getting to the point where
08:49 we went all the way up to a seven head
08:51 VCR meaning on this little drum
08:53 the polished chrome drum about three
08:56 inches and about two and half inches in
08:57 diameter the more heads you put on this
09:01 this drum when you hit pause the picture
09:04 was super clear because it was able to
09:07 read a bunch of data in a really short
09:09 period of time but as holding that tape
09:10 in place but the head of reality kept
09:12 going because the head is what's
09:14 creating the picture on the screen it
09:16 also ate the [ __ ] out of your tape so if
09:18 you pause too long it's knocking the
09:20 emulsion off your tape and so it starts
09:22 eating up your ear movie right there so
09:25 don't do that if you still have a VCR
09:26 but the interesting thing is is that
09:29 even though it was paused sort of an
09:32 advancement of time right time is on
09:34 this linear piece of tape know someone
09:36 real to the other the head still has to
09:38 move in order for you to see something
09:41 the reason why I mention this analogy is
09:44 that in order to pause time you must
09:49 pause II throw wins the very blood line
09:53 that keeps everything going right now
09:57 imagine you have a see-through pipe some
10:01 of you may have experienced this in your
10:02 lifetime and there is water going by
10:05 boom inside this pipe you can see it
10:06 sometimes industrial pipes like so you
10:08 have a perforated glass or plexiglass
10:12 opening so that you can see what's in
10:15 there well now what happens if you want
10:17 to pause the water I mean you're gonna
10:19 block this off here and block that off
10:21 there you're not gonna supply any more
10:22 water you got to cut off the supply the
10:25 water is still doing this jocelyn thing
10:27 inside the pipe right there's any play
10:29 at all you don't see it just freeze you
10:31 know the particles just there that's
10:35 your problem with you throw winds and
10:37 time travel in general and I'm just
10:40 starting with the time travel idea just
10:41 to kind of get you guys warmed up here
10:44 what you have to understand is that all
10:46 of everything not just life quote
10:51 unquote organic life but everything in
10:54 the entire universe is comprised of in
10:57 this reality if you're watching me on
10:59 youtube this $0.05 3-dimensional reality
11:03 of which we also create a [ __ ] tea
11:06 which is time because we have memory
11:09 everything is being constantly generated
11:11 out of this stuff everything every
11:15 single atom in the universe is nothing
11:17 more than a current a certain rotational
11:23 current of its behavior at a certain
11:26 speed of velocity and diameter Y
11:30 diameter well let me ask you this
11:33 if I showed you a rain drain in your
11:38 sink in your kitchen I mean starting to
11:41 rain during a drain in your kitchen we
11:43 fill up the sink and we pull out the
11:45 plug and it stretch the spiral you got
11:47 to get a probably on a four inch
11:48 diameter and it's going to get smaller
11:50 and smaller as what as the water volumes
11:53 reduces the diameter of that spiral that
11:58 current is going to shrink the very last
12:01 second it gets paper thin and there's a
12:03 way how many of you seen industrial
12:08 drains that are part of dams and so
12:11 you've got the still water it's part of
12:13 a lake and all the sudden they open that
12:15 chamber up and the lake goes roof got
12:17 inside this hole and things start
12:19 spinning in a vortex right you see the
12:23 rotation just begins it's just like a
12:25 natural thing as it is above so - it is
12:28 below so - it is it really below okay
12:32 the way that water behaves is right in
12:35 front of your face how ether behaves all
12:39 right and the interview was bart sibrel
12:42 keep saying his name wrong he made a
12:45 great point about how gravity works and
12:47 he says look we see bubbles in water
12:49 right now he mentioned black dark matter
12:51 which i don't think exists or you can
12:53 classify anything unseen as dark matter
12:55 but whatever he's correct water pushes
12:57 on air in a unified manner you see it
13:00 all the time right for you flat earthers
13:02 need to get up-to-date on this it caps
13:05 lates water in a bubble as it is below
13:09 so - it is above we reverse the analogy
13:13 every once in a while okay well isn't it
13:16 awesome that water is really the way you
13:19 understand
13:19 electricity when you go to electronic
13:21 school and they're trying to teach you
13:22 how to all the components work a
13:24 resistor a coil a diode a transistor you
13:31 have to just learn in your brain how
13:32 water flows and pipes and you need to
13:34 understand that all of these mechanisms
13:36 are merely mechanisms of water control a
13:40 silicon chip
13:43 well the electrons don't move inside
13:47 pipes okay but they move on conductive
13:51 surfaces surfaces that are able to
13:54 rotate their outer valence of electrons
13:58 so again when you want to send
14:00 electricity for those who haven't gotten
14:03 into it from one side of the room to the
14:04 other side of the room okay one of the
14:08 ways to think about it is the chainsaw
14:10 blade I've talked about this recently if
14:12 you put a little bit of fingernail
14:15 polish on a little tooth right here in
14:17 front of your chest right and your
14:19 buddies on the other side and you okay
14:21 turn Ellen and the cheating goes all the
14:23 way down to your buddy and that red dot
14:24 gets down to your friend that's when the
14:27 electron right in front of you actually
14:28 made it to the other side but you don't
14:31 actually need to wait for that little
14:32 red one to get all the way down to the
14:34 other side of the room before it's gonna
14:35 start cutting wood on the other side
14:37 right as the blade turns it's creating
14:40 this reaction which is we call a
14:43 conductive reaction right the only thing
14:46 electronic components are are components
14:50 that use the valence of electricity the
14:53 conductive nature of electricity this
14:55 this chain saw a reaction and it creates
15:00 sort of two-dimensional pipes on how to
15:03 control the electricity a diode only
15:06 allows electricity to move one way why
15:09 was that necessary because Tesla came in
15:11 with alternating current if you let
15:15 current on a alternating circuit run
15:18 what happens with the chainsaw blade is
15:20 that that nail polish will go halfway
15:23 down the chainsaw and then come back to
15:24 you and go halfway and go back to you it
15:27 just oscillates back and forth so you
15:29 put a diode in there that chainsaw blade
15:31 goes half way while the current is
15:33 sucking backwards nothing's happening
15:35 but as it pushes forward again it pushes
15:39 that thing to the other side of the room
15:41 in the next positive sine wave right
15:44 yeah for those of you like Jesus man I
15:47 don't really like your episode a little
15:49 too nerdy here's why it's important in
15:53 my opinion let's say you're a hippie
15:57 when you like it you got crystals in
16:00 your house you feel spirit energy you
16:06 can see auras you're gonna hug a person
16:09 and you are sensitive enough to feel it
16:11 the massive emotional spiritual
16:15 difference of a hug all of that is being
16:20 created or I should say mediated by
16:26 ether now there's a lot of us that
16:29 believe that there's a spiritual energy
16:30 that runs on top of this that the you
16:37 know it's like that game in the 70s I
16:41 don't even know probably that's probably
16:43 way back 100 years ago but it's the one
16:45 that was really famous when I was a kid
16:47 you have a some of you guys still have
16:50 these in your house they're out it's a
16:51 square box it has a bunch of holes on it
16:54 and there is a like a ball bearing court
16:59 like a half inch ball burn the box has
17:01 these adjustable little knobs on it and
17:03 it tilts the world that the ball
17:06 bearings on up back left right and then
17:08 goal of the game is to trick the ball to
17:11 go from one side of the maze that's in
17:14 this thing to the other side but if you
17:16 get in the wrong way it's gonna drop to
17:19 a hole and you got to restart the game
17:20 again right and the analogy of the
17:23 spirit related to e throw wins your
17:26 spirit is the ball it's this uniquely
17:30 identifying energy that is you it is
17:33 your consciousness it's what you are
17:34 listening to me right now the world that
17:38 is shaking turning and twisting well
17:39 that's the ether 'el realization you
17:44 know if you just had the ball floating
17:45 in space what are you you're just
17:47 sitting in space too
17:47 nothing the second you put it into an
17:50 environment you have a paradigm ah well
17:52 now a ball makes more sense to me it's a
17:54 thing that rolls around in a pinball
17:55 machine but without the pinball machine
17:57 this clump of metal that's polished it's
17:59 neat looking but has no purpose it has
18:02 no purpose unless it's given a paradigm
18:06 of existence right
18:08 what's a let's say ball burning when
18:11 it's inside a packed wheel assembly it's
18:17 a ball bearing that keeps the tire
18:18 spinning beautifully right
18:20 was it your CV boot or whatever it is
18:22 ball bearings are useful for all kinds
18:24 of things imagine that the pinball ball
18:28 that we've seen in pinball machines
18:30 their whole life was actually ripped off
18:31 from some other piece of industrial
18:32 equipment and for 80 years prior to the
18:35 invention of a pinball machine
18:37 pin balls are balls that bag were used
18:40 in [ __ ] I don't know some some crazy
18:42 motor the Edison invented or something
18:45 and so everyone knew them as ball
18:48 bearings that were in gigantic engines
18:51 and someone goes what you're doing with
18:53 that ball all right I made this thing
18:55 you know it's got flippers in it bumpers
18:56 and boo-boo
18:57 you get me but it's it's interesting to
18:59 to think about the shifts in the brain
19:02 any time man has an epiphany in history
19:07 it is important for us to crawl into
19:09 their minds prior to the Epiphany and
19:12 try to relive the epiphany because it
19:16 will yield our own epiphanies which
19:19 might be taking it to the next level
19:20 I'll give you another example of
19:21 epiphanies that are actually very useful
19:25 to recreate I'm a screenwriter okay all
19:30 right I bumped it to a new friend named
19:33 Steve brilliant guy and we're talking
19:36 about our scripts together and he shared
19:40 some brilliant stuff that he was working
19:42 on and I shared my best stuff and each
19:46 one of us in the at the end you know we
19:50 let ourselves you know finish but at the
19:53 end each one of us said you know what I
19:56 thought you were gonna do I thought you
19:57 were gonna go this way instead of that
19:58 way
20:01 there's nothing more valuable in the
20:03 world as a writer than having that
20:06 moment with someone else and there
20:07 you're like oh my god you know it's
20:09 either gonna go one way or the other it
20:11 usually is you know I thought about that
20:12 but then this breaks and that breaks oh
20:14 yeah yeah yeah that's cool I like your
20:16 choice even more now or sometimes the
20:21 guy or girl whoever you're talking to
20:23 gives you this other idea and then
20:26 you're like wow that's ingenious
20:30 I might just change my script I've done
20:35 it to people and people have done it to
20:36 me Kyle my old host did that to me a
20:40 bunch of times he's a brilliant writer
20:42 by the way he never mentions it but he's
20:44 like the Dukan Smith the sentence that
20:46 you read and you know it's the first
20:49 time Francis Bacon laid down and take it
20:52 and took a nap you know but now what are
20:55 we taught when were little kids about
20:56 the universe if you study biology or
20:59 physics or any type of constructional
21:04 sciences right what we're all made out
21:06 of well they tell you the center of the
21:09 world's got nickel iron Saturn's full of
21:12 fart clouds and tootsie rolls made out
21:15 of sugar right your your body has blood
21:18 and it's got red blood cells and white
21:20 blood cells everything is all divided up
21:22 into different pieces and parts and I'm
21:24 not saying that there's any problem
21:26 understanding the higher constructs of
21:29 what everything is called of course we
21:31 need to know these things so we know how
21:32 to live our lives but the one blind spot
21:38 that we are all bred into is the lack of
21:41 etheral particles if you were told as a
21:46 child and you know there is a bit of
21:48 this in physics which is a [ __ ] joke
21:51 because of course of course we're all
21:54 built out of a unified particle you know
21:57 the latest incarnation is the Higgs
21:59 boson particle which you know all I can
22:04 say is [ __ ] okay that particle is
22:09 the is is like a it's like an atomic
22:12 particle created by a committee of
22:14 people
22:14 with butthurt snowflake Minds well my
22:19 theory gets in there too okay we'll put
22:21 your theory on them oh it's getting to
22:23 be a big particle now Joey you know oh
22:26 just [ __ ] painful man painful [ __ ]
22:30 mate maybe even exists but damn these
22:33 people have tried to create reality on a
22:35 piece of paper and just it's like CERN
22:39 Hadron Collider I mean you're talking
22:41 about if the outside charter I would say
22:45 95% of a charter of that object that
22:48 machine the biggest machine man has ever
22:50 made that we're aware of if that thing
22:53 is real the whole thing is full of a
22:57 bunch of old stale science and you're
23:02 only invited into the program if you
23:04 have old stale science man you could be
23:07 19 years old
23:08 super genius but you're gonna have to
23:11 refrain from mentioning anything that
23:13 has to do with electrical universe with
23:15 ether winds where the rediscovering of
23:17 what this world is made out of so just
23:21 pumps and doctrine ation into their
23:23 veins I'm not convinced they really
23:26 believe any of the outward crap but they
23:28 did give it was with a Higgs guy or
23:31 whatever some awards saying they found
23:34 the god particle and go see my certain
23:36 episode for that been pissin and moanin
23:37 about that for last month or so when you
23:42 peel it all back to a single particle
23:44 that has a single behavior of moving in
23:48 3d space doesn't matter if it's a
23:51 Cartesian coordinate system a flat 2d
23:53 plane and some memory somewhere in a
23:56 computer's that's being used as our
23:58 simulation our three-dimensional memory
24:00 and some super quantum systems somewhere
24:02 in some other dimension and we're just
24:04 the byproduct of it fine I don't really
24:06 care how this is actually occurring
24:08 personally because it's occurring the
24:11 Egyptians said they healed people
24:13 through frequency they laid you down in
24:15 an altar at a conversation with you you
24:18 know how about you feel again they
24:20 didn't have cell phone cancer and you
24:23 know aspartame rotting minds and
24:25 vaccinations causing autistic brain
24:27 damage children
24:28 crap because they weren't stupid they
24:31 lived off the land a perfect harmony
24:33 with the earth but they laid you on an
24:37 altar and using a big electrical plant
24:39 called the pyramids and the huge
24:41 catacomb of water underneath and a big
24:44 conductive rod that went down into that
24:46 water that's on top of aqua ravine
24:49 providing moral and natural electricity
24:51 up same thing as Tesla constructed in
24:54 Colorado Springs some several thousand
24:56 years later they resonated your body
25:00 they resonated your body with a
25:02 frequency that cannot atomically hurt
25:05 your native biology but all of the weak
25:10 invaders the bacteria the viruses they
25:13 get shattered all you got to do is take
25:17 a crap and it's all going we have seen
25:20 how zero-point energy systems are
25:22 created all the time on the internet
25:23 we've seen it I saw a funny little
25:27 observe point energy system where
25:29 someone took a coral coiled copper wire
25:31 the same diameter of his double-a
25:33 battery and this girl puts it in one in
25:37 with a certain polarity and it starts to
25:39 fly around the inside of this coil all
25:41 by itself and she connected them
25:42 together and it just kept going there
25:45 you go right oh yeah it'll probably
25:47 diminish over time as the battery loses
25:49 its charged but Jesus I'll take that
25:51 over paying my electric bill any day
25:54 that months right they assassinate
25:57 people who build zero-point energy
25:58 systems like Stan Myers again I sat for
26:02 most of the year of 2003 in Laguna
26:08 here in California Southern California
26:10 across the table from a guy who sold his
26:13 company for nearly half a billion
26:14 dollars a VC company and I mentioned
26:17 about what is this deal about people
26:20 creating zero-point energy systems he
26:23 says oh yeah yeah what we do is we kill
26:24 him listen what he goes yeah you know
26:28 usually there in the Midwest some guy
26:30 who's figured it out there's he goes
26:32 there's only a few machines that can do
26:34 it we know them all and then of course
26:36 they need money to get their idea
26:38 manufactured we invite them in and on
26:41 the trip either to and from and we
26:44 encourage them to use their energy
26:46 system to get here they can create a car
26:48 or something else we just accidental I
26:50 think he gave me a number of at least
26:52 seven people in his lifetime than he
26:54 knew did that and the funny thing is
26:55 that the VC company gets a little silent
26:57 kickback a little loan or something to
27:00 keep these guys from ever getting money
27:04 to see their idea through you know
27:07 Tesla's big tower got knocked down 1927
27:11 he spent 10 years building this thing
27:14 and they made him knock it down because
27:16 it was going to give free power to
27:17 everyone transmit it directly into your
27:19 house without hurting anything in
27:21 between I'm not completely convinced
27:25 that Tesla really understood the damage
27:28 to mitochondria and the and the
27:30 subatomic biological particles of our
27:32 body and electricity he didn't have any
27:34 expertise now I know of in those areas
27:37 so you keeps hearing things that Tesla's
27:40 whole thing was safe he might have been
27:41 full of [ __ ] but the guy did live to be
27:43 quite old and he exposed himself to a
27:47 tremendous amount of electricity so
27:49 hopefully he was right but they made him
27:51 tear it down because it was going to get
27:52 in the way of selling energy anything
27:57 that competes with oil it's marginalized
28:00 people are killed and hopefully
28:03 according to the oil companies hopefully
28:06 before you ever discover it ever existed
28:08 that way they don't have to explain
28:09 themselves there's no mess you don't
28:11 even know about the mess it was cleaned
28:12 up a long time ago but that's a higher
28:15 idea right that's fracturing tap water
28:18 to be hydrogen you know pop the hydrogen
28:21 attack
28:21 Stan Meyers engine murdered in 1998
28:24 drinking drinking a small glass of
28:25 cranberry juice in front of his family
28:27 after being off at one point 1 billion
28:29 dollars for invention and he turned it
28:31 down
28:31 because he thought angels were
28:32 protecting him he feared nothing the
28:36 total deletion of ether winds and ether
28:41 particles out of our scientific books of
28:45 some atop subatomic physics has made us
28:48 stupid every single day and because it
28:52 contributes to all things biological and
28:55 material mineral you know it retards our
29:00 brains away from understanding the
29:02 beautiful nature that we have there our
29:04 relationship that we have with things
29:07 like the Sun what if I told you that the
29:10 Rays of the Sun will exacerbate the
29:13 thoughts you have in your mind because
29:15 your mind is an electrical object it
29:19 uses bioelectric matter neurons nervous
29:23 system construction throughout your
29:25 system all of your you know your heart
29:28 runs on electricity right people who
29:31 have congenital heart problems often
29:32 have a problem if they don't have a
29:34 deformity in their art but usually the
29:36 even deformities in a congenital heart
29:38 problem are related to the the nature of
29:41 conductivity in the muscle tissue so
29:44 when your little fetus inside your
29:45 mother the electrical stimulation and
29:48 one of your valves isn't correct the DNA
29:50 didn't form properly perhaps there's a
29:52 Down syndrome gene in there and so it's
29:54 constructing the wrong circuits and so
29:56 things aren't performing correctly my
29:59 grandfather had a congenital heart issue
30:00 which I do not have but his was an
30:03 electrical one he had a weak valve it
30:08 lived to be 60 years old that's not bad
30:10 supposed to die at 12 I don't know where
30:12 the hell they come up these numbers so
30:15 here's the heart here's the Sun scuse me
30:16 pounding you when I'm out here see these
30:19 little rays to go across my face I
30:21 guarantee you those rays are penetrating
30:24 my skull my pituitary gland is creating
30:27 vitamin D vitamin D is paramount to
30:32 health
30:33 people who are outside running on the
30:35 beach running jogging they think it's
30:37 because they're jogging and they're
30:39 partially correct the cardiovascular
30:42 system once you use your body you don't
30:44 lose your body but the same exact time
30:47 they're being imbued with the power to
30:48 be whatever they want to be on a mental
30:50 level obviously you need to challenge
30:53 yourself otherwise you will have very
30:55 low neural counts in your brain the more
30:59 you think the more you over stimulate
31:01 the electricity in your brain and the
31:03 more it spawns new brain cells so I just
31:04 said in a recent episode which I don't
31:06 know if I will have aired before this
31:08 one now my gravity episode I went
31:11 through all this about how Heathrow
31:14 winds actually turn into electricity for
31:15 instance things that ricochet off of
31:21 themselves is the dielectric wave so if
31:25 you if you had a steel ball and you
31:27 shoot a bullet at it well if you hit it
31:29 directly on and that and the bullet
31:32 doesn't lose its form and the ball
31:35 doesn't lose its form you know it's
31:36 coming right back at your face exactly
31:38 go right back in the barrel of the gun
31:39 that's perfect what's the time it reflex
31:42 off in a different trajectory okay but
31:47 we also know orbiting happens we see it
31:49 in water all the time right
31:52 now there are some drains that I was
31:54 talking about the water and the dam
31:56 sometimes you'll see the drain when it
31:58 first gets popped and it first gets
31:59 opened the water's flowing directly down
32:02 the hole that's a dielectric path
32:04 straight into the hole versus not
32:06 reflecting out so it's not really
32:08 dielectric but it's in that straight
32:09 perpendicular path to the opening of the
32:11 hole but let to go for a few seconds so
32:16 it will start doing the rotation thing
32:17 because there's outside forces and the
32:20 pool of water that are trying to go in
32:21 random directions now water isn't a pure
32:25 perfect example of ether because it will
32:28 have a lot of currents that are going in
32:31 a bunch of different directions but I
32:32 think that's the way that ether winds
32:34 have organized themselves which is what
32:36 we call gravity waves
32:40 but we see orbiting happen all the time
32:42 the moon orbits the earth it does
32:45 there's planets orbiting our moons that
32:48 will bring planets again the weird thing
32:50 about flowers for me is that you can
32:53 take a Dell a telescope pointing to
32:55 Jupiter point in Mars much closer and
33:00 you can see celestial bodies going
33:02 around those bodies you can see them
33:06 yeah you can't see them in super detail
33:08 but you can see how they go around these
33:09 other objects so the idea that that's
33:12 happening out there but it's not
33:13 happening to us and we have a bone
33:14 mm-hmm I'm not saying the moon is what
33:17 we think it is okay I don't believe in
33:19 craters at all I don't think I believe
33:22 in meteorites worth a damn
33:25 meteorites I've always seen you know
33:28 photographed as supposedly hitting human
33:30 beings and cars they're not creating
33:32 perfectly round craters anywhere doesn't
33:37 make any sense right when the particle
33:41 is bouncing back from Center which is
33:43 the dielectric wave bounces into the
33:45 orbital wave you get electromagnetism
33:47 okay
33:48 a very specific behavior that we can
33:50 utilize for energy so all we have to do
33:54 is start to teach ether winds to college
34:00 students to grade schoolers and see what
34:03 they come up with because we're not
34:04 teaching it when my daughter was young
34:08 she was nine years old we invented this
34:11 ritual when I got her this whiteboard in
34:12 her bedroom one of the ways I got her to
34:14 sleep was to say it was class time and
34:17 she'd run in that room and jump down
34:18 there was just two things that happens I
34:20 would explain something I wanted to
34:22 explain to her and then I would love her
34:24 to ask me any question about anything in
34:25 the whole world and I'd write it on the
34:27 board and explain it to her thank God
34:29 she was good with her questions but I
34:33 regret that the first time that I taught
34:35 her the first thing I ever taught her
34:38 was gravity and I was using the old
34:39 crappy model of mass pulling against
34:42 mass which made no goddamn sense how do
34:45 I taught my daughter ether wins she
34:48 would have school to [ __ ] out of her
34:49 teachers and she got a degree in
34:51 chemistry so she's not an idiot
34:54 thank God she loves science go figure
35:01 but back to the stopping time analogy
35:03 just to visit that and finish it up real
35:05 quick
35:05 the idea is you can't stop time because
35:07 then you would have to stop all the
35:08 ether and ethers never going to stop
35:10 so this illusion of change that creates
35:14 this illusion of time and memory that
35:17 makes us remember the previous state
35:19 what a beautiful amazing thing that is
35:21 right memory what a crazy idea that we
35:26 have memory all there is is the now
35:28 that's it man now there's this rumor
35:33 that Tesla wrote in a paper that he
35:36 created a time machine as part of the
35:38 really funny Donald Trump is a serial
35:42 Amin time traveler right what Tesla
35:46 described if you read it very carefully
35:48 was that he had surrounded himself in a
35:50 cloud of electricity and that gazing
35:53 outside and his five points in sense
35:56 system gazing outside of the room he
35:58 said that time looked very distorted hmm
36:02 okay
36:03 what I didn't hear him say was that his
36:06 assistant was moving at you know a rapid
36:10 pace or a slow pace I didn't hear him
36:13 say a dinosaur walked by all of a sudden
36:15 I didn't hear him say that he saw
36:17 spaceships all of a sudden I didn't hear
36:20 him say anything that indicated time
36:21 would change but I think we could
36:23 probably theorize why he might be able
36:26 to see his assistant move slow or
36:27 assistant move fast because ether a
36:32 particles are a part of all metabolism
36:34 of all things right I'm looking at a
36:38 pottery bowl then I turn it upside down
36:40 so that my previous gardener wouldn't
36:43 weed back a little plant I've been
36:45 trying to grow the new guys awesome by
36:49 the way but if the particles are the
36:53 currents that make up of ether that make
36:55 up that bowl or to just decide to
36:57 disperse that ball would cease to exist
37:00 immediately they'd be recycled into
37:03 something else go free
37:05 when you burn something up you're doing
37:08 exactly that your thermal izing it
37:10 you're exciting it with the reaction of
37:12 fire the verbal reaction of fire which
37:14 is why you see photons and fire and what
37:17 to do it takes everything that can be
37:18 combusted and releases it into the
37:20 universe as fast-moving ether which is
37:23 what we call heat okay and it escapes it
37:27 goes up what's left well the carbon it
37:32 won't burn okay
37:36 carbon is a fundamental you throw a wind
37:39 current of the universe it takes a hell
37:42 of a lot more energy to destroy carbon
37:45 than we have ever found okay might be
37:49 interesting to do the math on what would
37:50 happen if you could shatter a carbon
37:52 atom the carbon bomb but now if we can
37:57 acknowledge for a second that there's
37:58 this wind that's everywhere it is the
38:01 fundamental thing that keeps everything
38:02 together it is the tiniest little Lego
38:06 you could possibly build anything out of
38:08 and the way it moves in the universe is
38:13 the way it creates things now please
38:16 don't think I'm going after the
38:18 evolutional model or creation model
38:21 adapt your belief in the in the first
38:25 theory of what controls all this and
38:27 apply it if you're an evolutionist then
38:29 this is all random something from
38:30 nothing if you're a creationist then you
38:33 believe that there's a consciousness
38:34 that is perhaps even made out of this
38:37 here him or herself and they hold this
38:41 all together it's really irrelevant at
38:43 this stage of the conversation but this
38:45 stuff goes through everything which is
38:47 why the Michael's an experiment of
38:48 saying we're controlling ether all
38:51 sensing okay by building pipes right if
38:55 pipes were capable of controlling ether
38:59 then the zero gravity system of the
39:02 world would be put a bunch of pipes over
39:03 you and then ether couldn't go through
39:05 pipes and then all of a sudden you'd be
39:06 weightless underneath the ether
39:08 underneath the pipes right it just makes
39:10 no sense at all but back on subject of
39:14 like spirituality why don't we have
39:17 intuition
39:18 why do we seem to be able to read
39:20 certain people's minds you know you get
39:23 with the boyfriend and girlfriend he
39:24 gets so close to each other you can't
39:25 finish you finish each other's sentences
39:28 my daughter I sort of got she would be
39:31 in the backseat of my car this has
39:34 happened at least gosh
39:35 three or four super profound times and
39:38 she's in the backseat reading my mind
39:40 and I'm thinking about something so
39:43 esoteric my child is so young she hasn't
39:45 had these experiences yet and she will
39:48 say what I was thinking now why would I
39:51 be having a stronger connection to my
39:53 kid and say someone right next to me
39:56 who's new you get in my car I don't know
39:58 you get my car why is it that the more
40:02 you talk to a human being if you're
40:04 going to be compatible with them you get
40:07 more compatible with them but next time
40:10 you see them you have this weird feeling
40:12 like you know a really good friend is
40:14 one of those people you met yesterday
40:15 but man it feels like you've known him
40:16 your whole life what's creating that
40:19 feeling it's absolutely irrational and I
40:24 can tell you that I've had that feeling
40:25 with people who have a past that's very
40:28 compatible with mine you know I meet
40:30 someone in California like I was raised
40:31 in Kansas - where are you raised we find
40:34 out we raise five miles from each other
40:35 no [ __ ]
40:36 yeah you ever go to that place oh yeah
40:37 it's great Tastee Freez was so good
40:39 there and talked about the ice place in
40:40 here I've known someone like that and
40:43 didn't feel the huge connection it was
40:44 it was nostalgic and cool I definitely
40:47 liked talking to them but then there's
40:49 someone who's braised in California
40:51 Southern California never really left
40:53 the county and there's just this
40:56 connection with them they think like I
40:59 think you know or at least they
41:01 spiritually evaluate things similar
41:03 right
41:04 there's experiments where you put two
41:06 people's foreheads together for 25
41:08 minutes and then for the next five
41:09 minutes they're sharing thoughts when
41:11 you pull them apart just like the
41:14 pinball machine carrying the pinball the
41:17 universe is the machine and you are the
41:19 pinball information is being carried on
41:22 top of this other wave now what'll
41:25 happen to you is that this is a brand
41:27 new concept for you but I mean utterly
41:30 brand-new it'll take you a while it'll
41:32 thank you well unless you're just
41:33 totally falling into this like a natural
41:35 talent which could happen too but it'll
41:37 take you a while to look everywhere that
41:39 you exist in your bedroom and when
41:41 you're by yourself in the shower and
41:43 when you're driving down the street when
41:45 you hear about things you'll see
41:46 scientific experiments if you pay
41:48 attention and it'll suddenly explain
41:52 everything and I'll give you an example
41:54 that I sort of already mentioned but
41:56 there was a video online well there's
41:58 this this is phenomenon going on in
42:01 April of 2018 where people are taking
42:03 gigantic balls of tin foil pounding them
42:06 with hammers and sledge hammers and
42:08 stuff and they eventually get it pounded
42:10 down to a beautiful shiny ball they sand
42:13 it with high-grade you know 1000 grit
42:15 sandpaper and it just turns into like a
42:18 sphere like a big rollerball ball but
42:23 this guy I watched the next video and
42:25 what he had done is he bought a thousand
42:26 pound magnet it was a brick about five
42:30 inches by three inches by three inches
42:32 and what it meant was if he were to
42:35 attach that to like a lead or a metal or
42:40 steel excuse me I don't even know if
42:41 LEDs
42:42 gonna be attracted to this but you
42:43 attach it to a steel beam or something
42:47 it would take a thousand pounds of
42:49 pressure to remove the magnet from the
42:50 steel you'll never pull it off right so
42:53 he had to be very careful with this
42:55 magnet because if he accidentally
42:56 dropped it against his motorcycle or his
42:58 car he's not gonna have enough power to
43:01 get this thing off his car ever you'll
43:05 have to use some mechanical device to
43:07 get it off this vehicle but he rigged up
43:10 this he has pet mice and he rigged up a
43:13 pole on a spindle this was like a wake
43:17 up rod and he put one mouse in one clear
43:21 cup like the like the kind of red cups
43:23 you get at parties but it was clear and
43:25 so the little mouse is cute and he's
43:27 cleaning himself off and there's none on
43:29 the other side anyway the same so it was
43:30 weighing like a swingset or like a sorry
43:32 I guess like a seesaw and he takes his
43:35 thousand-pound magnet it was just
43:37 beautiful polished steel and he puts it
43:39 against the mouse and the mouse starts
43:43 going backwards
43:44 and he explains to you the dielectric
43:47 force that is creating that push against
43:50 that Mouse goes against the backside of
43:52 the mouse it goes the other way now had
43:54 he had an organized piece of steel in
43:56 that Cup it would have sucked against
44:00 that magnet and if he'd had a finger in
44:02 there it would have been snipped off
44:04 instantaneously
44:06 that's ether all wins it is everything
44:10 that Faraday and Tesla told us about
44:13 ether all winds the same thing that
44:17 happens in an electrical circuit an
44:21 electromagnetic relationship between
44:23 dielectric waves and magnet magnetic
44:26 waves is happening on that creature why
44:29 isn't the creature sucking against the
44:31 magnet because the poles that are coming
44:36 out of the magnet are unified like a Van
44:38 Allen belt when they slam into the mouse
44:43 again this is a thousand-pound magnet so
44:45 it's a seriously high velocity belt
44:49 that's going around this magnet okay it
44:53 can't grab on to the variable body cells
44:58 of this Mouse the mouse is chaotically
45:02 organized into an organic object and so
45:06 all it can do is go in there and bounce
45:09 off creating the force against the mouse
45:13 which is pushing him back but if he put
45:17 an organized crystallized steel in there
45:20 all bets are off it's going to go into
45:24 that organized steel and find a perfect
45:27 pathway through that steel and it's
45:30 going to suck it like a vacuum directly
45:32 at the magnet why does the magnet have a
45:35 pole because of II throw winds why does
45:40 the earth have a vanillin boat because
45:42 of ether winds how does the magnet exist
45:47 in the first place well it's got some
45:50 magnetized materials that it's built out
45:52 of I forgot what this particular one was
45:53 made out of it was gorgeous but has been
45:57 loaded up
45:58 crystalline structure inside very
46:01 unified in the way that it's little tiny
46:03 poles okay are all combined to augment
46:07 themselves it starts to amplify imagine
46:10 I come up behind you like a big [ __ ]
46:14 and I push you into the pool I can push
46:17 you maybe six feet into the pool then
46:20 you get out and kicked my ass but what
46:23 if I pushed your left side and someone
46:27 exactly my size pushed you on the right
46:29 side and we pushed you at the same time
46:32 with two hands on your left and two
46:34 hands on your right so you have four
46:36 times or two times the power pushing you
46:39 you may not go exactly 12 feet but
46:43 you're probably gonna go 91 and a half
46:46 because you have more force on you this
46:50 amplification is what's the basis of the
46:52 Tesla coil it's the basis of coils if
46:56 you had a half an amp going into a coil
46:58 and it goes one rotation around it's now
47:02 one amp one more rotation around it's
47:05 two amps and the Keefe's keeps going up
47:06 and up and up that's why they test the
47:08 coil is so powerful Tesla invented the
47:11 Tesla coil for one reason that has been
47:16 completely lost at least in all of the
47:18 examples that I see online which is to
47:23 go from the bottom of the Tesla coil
47:25 it's at the top and then zap electricity
47:27 off the top using a big chrome kind of
47:32 elliptical sphere up there and you
47:35 create some target
47:36 it's either negative or positively
47:39 charged depending how you run the Tesla
47:41 coil and then WHAM there goes a piece of
47:43 electricity a lightning bolt when I was
47:45 at the Boston Science Museum as a young
47:48 man probably 11 years old and wouldn't
47:50 saw million volts the guys inside of a
47:52 Faraday cage okay he puts his arms on
47:55 the inside of the cage here comes a
47:57 million volts from the Tesla coil over
47:59 to the cage and based on a Faraday cage
48:02 which is a very specific thing I need
48:05 you guys to understand Faraday cages
48:06 okay if electricity is alternating and
48:11 varying in
48:12 it's a voltage or it's amperage it will
48:18 it won't work it'll go through the cage
48:20 and shock the [ __ ] out of you if you
48:23 make it a fixed frequency I could direct
48:26 current it's at this frequency oh man
48:30 it's the cage and because the of the
48:33 Faraday cage and it's sort of it's a
48:37 it's a water tension model using a grid
48:41 which is the cage it'll only be able to
48:44 spread out around the outside but if
48:47 it's a variable circuit it can crawl
48:50 inside the cage when you hit by a
48:52 lightning bolt if you had a Faraday cage
48:53 which is your car you'll stay on the
48:56 outside because the lightning bolts made
48:57 of one gigantic charge boom and if that
49:00 thing stayed on and started changing its
49:04 frequency like a Borg does right are the
49:08 lasers that shoot Borg's you go right
49:10 inside your car and fire you to death so
49:13 for those of you who are Preppers and
49:15 survivalists and you're trying to build
49:17 Faraday cages inside your house you need
49:20 to look at what source of signal you're
49:22 trying to reflect off of that cage it's
49:26 got to be a unified frequency at least
49:31 that's how that explained to me you
49:32 won't catch me put my arms on the inside
49:34 of a cage and it's shocking it but
49:36 Tesla's whole invention was too full he
49:43 did two experiments all the time but he
49:46 was in Colorado Springs what he did was
49:49 he built one Tesla coil to bring an
49:51 infinitesimal amount of electricity out
49:52 of the ether using that elliptical
49:54 sphere at the top to grab etheral
49:57 particles which once it collides with
49:58 that sphere that metal conductive sphere
50:01 up there creates a little bit of ambient
50:04 electricity a bit like a solar panel
50:05 then he brings it down the coil system
50:07 and amps it up then he shoved a big
50:11 spike into the ground
50:14 as he described it he lured out of the
50:17 earth I assumed he did this on an aqua
50:20 ravine because he built his antenna on
50:22 aqua Veen starting in 1917 he takes a
50:25 little bit and then he said he siphoned
50:26 out of the bowels of the earth which is
50:28 a plasma sphere meaning the most
50:32 fundamental powerful ether loud you
50:35 could possibly construct is a plasma
50:38 particle it can be anything when it
50:41 slows down which is cool he ran it over
50:43 to another Tesla coil that then took
50:47 that high amp source and even made it
50:50 higher and so his big Colorado Springs
50:53 experiment was he was sitting there and
50:54 it's a famous photograph of him sitting
50:56 in that barrel shaped building with this
50:58 cage in the center and he's reading a
51:00 book and he's completely surrounded by
51:02 electricity and the way that that has
51:04 been documented by him and his assistant
51:06 was that the lightning bolt stood for
51:09 one minute 60 seconds this thing was
51:13 just blasting and breaking the sound
51:15 barrier I don't know how that guy didn't
51:17 go deaf honestly during that experiment
51:19 but the assistant has to break the
51:21 circuit thus breaking the siphon it's
51:25 over he packs his bags and leaves
51:28 Colorado Springs and he starts building
51:31 the 1917 Tesla Tower what was that thing
51:36 was a big Tower it's a big gigantic
51:38 Tesla coil the size of like a water
51:41 tower at the top is the big conductive
51:45 sphere he's gonna grab a much bigger
51:48 supply of electricity out of the ether
51:51 and drive it down to a system that would
51:54 amplify the [ __ ] out of it and then once
51:57 he mastered that he was going to start
51:58 broadcasting it to households which
52:02 would then grab this lower frequency
52:04 agitated back up to a higher frequency
52:05 and we'd all have electricity and you
52:07 never have a wire anywhere in the world
52:09 you'd never have to have a battery in
52:10 anything you just have to be in the line
52:13 of shot of this electricity now
52:16 obviously nothing's that simple as we
52:18 know that you know unless you can pipe
52:20 it in every direction all the time as
52:24 soon as you flew on your plane your
52:26 phone when shut off
52:27 power so might we might add batteries
52:29 just to do up in terms of charging and
52:32 equipment could be that a city is
52:34 constantly peppered with this stuff and
52:37 so as long as you got your electric car
52:38 inside New York City it would just run
52:40 you park it it's constantly charging or
52:42 doesn't have to charge doesn't matter
52:44 but maybe you have to go in the country
52:45 where they don't have full proliferation
52:47 as technology and your battery starts
52:49 taking over for a little while get to
52:50 your destination he's beaming it over
52:52 there boom you start charging back up
52:54 again here okay no one ever accused
52:57 Tesla of building things that didn't
52:59 work it's probably the thing he's most
53:01 famous for he built things in his brain
53:04 for years until they worked perfectly
53:07 then he built them in real life hmm okay
53:12 well he believed in ether in fact he was
53:16 the master of ether he just called an
53:19 electricity pretty cool but let me hit
53:23 you up with one little caveat before we
53:25 in the episode we're always talking
53:28 about dreams right on this show and
53:31 getting really close to doing another
53:32 dream episode but what happens when we
53:36 go to bed fall asleep okay there's a
53:41 bunch of people don't have dreams not
53:42 sure why that's the case I don't know
53:46 what happens when you fall asleep now
53:50 some people don't dream at least they
53:52 don't remember them when they wake up
53:53 and I for the life of me can not figure
53:56 that out I dream like I've said several
53:59 times and my dreams are getting more
54:01 intense and more intense it's almost as
54:03 if by doing dream research and I don't
54:07 write anything down when I wake up in
54:09 the morning I probably should but I tell
54:12 my friends about my dreams a lot so that
54:15 helps me remember them forever but they
54:18 are saugus they go on forever and I'll
54:20 recycle a dream I had one the other day
54:22 I recycled that I was in the dream and I
54:24 was like oh my god I haven't had this
54:26 dream in a really long time but I knew
54:29 the dream I knew where I was I knew what
54:31 I needed to do and I did an adult
54:32 version of the dream runs like I'm not
54:34 playing this [ __ ] anymore I was
54:36 being chased it's like a girlfriend and
54:38 I were in
54:40 like a mansion on a hill and we were
54:44 being kind of held captive like it was
54:48 kind of a modern like a like a modern
54:52 home but it was built like a castle like
54:54 some guy had some fetish and so we
54:57 escaped and we found out we're on a hill
54:58 and so now we're down inside this kind
55:00 of Streamy weird woods they're being
55:02 chased they don't know where we are we
55:04 don't know where they are but we're kind
55:05 of sure that this is away from the place
55:08 it was just an old dream but like I said
55:12 in one of my recent episodes I said look
55:14 how is it that you're able to imagine
55:17 physics perfect in a dream because you
55:21 are right you cast light in your brain
55:24 better than any video game engine that's
55:26 ever been written
55:27 well housewife or some young kid I could
55:33 see it like they were a master
55:35 physicists like they were a master game
55:37 programmer how's that possible right
55:42 both ether exists and it penetrates all
55:47 things because it makes all things right
55:50 and we're saying that gravity exists
55:52 because ether one is bounced off of
55:55 objects that are so dense that ether
55:57 fights ether and it creates this push
56:01 push on you and for those of you think
56:03 it's air pressure it's not air pressure
56:05 when you vacuum a chamber with a feather
56:07 in it if air pressure was gravity then
56:10 the feather would float directly in the
56:11 center of the box that is a very old
56:14 hypothesis that they proved false way
56:18 before they had any theory of the being
56:20 anything else but if we go up to the
56:23 carrier wave of consciousness that rides
56:25 on top of this stuff right the life
56:26 force it's out there well just because
56:30 you're asleep doesn't mean reality stops
56:32 it just means you're really not
56:33 participating in this five-cent system
56:35 when you're in your dreams you do not
56:36 have five senses you don't now why we
56:39 have to dream it's never been explained
56:43 dark City is probably the biggest clue
56:48 to why we have to sleep
56:50 here we are built out of receptive
56:52 antenna
56:53 you know nucleic acid chains called DNA
56:57 they're shaped exactly like antennas so
57:01 it would seem as if when we go to sleep
57:03 we're being programmed it's time for a
57:06 software upgrade it's time for a memory
57:08 backup
57:09 great for any of you back up your
57:10 computers to cloud software or external
57:14 hard drives well you know it takes a
57:15 little while to do that right it's best
57:17 if you don't use your computer you ever
57:19 want to diagnose this on your hard drive
57:21 while using your computer the morning
57:23 comes up and goes okay we're gonna start
57:25 using the [ __ ] out of your hard drive so
57:26 things are in a really slow if you do
57:28 anything on your computer that requires
57:29 hard drive reading and writing because
57:32 we're using it it's beautiful our
57:35 computers have upgraded our thinking
57:38 about ourselves if you really pay
57:40 attention the time that I woke up to a
57:44 great alien tell me what's in my
57:45 Christmas present and he was right I was
57:48 sleeping in a twin bed with my
57:50 girlfriend we hadn't bought our
57:51 queen-size bed yet we just moved in
57:52 together but my back was to her back and
57:55 our brains were probably no more than
57:58 two feet away from each other all night
58:01 if I spooned her as she spooned me than
58:03 man her brains 6 inches 2 inches maybe
58:06 even touching and that's that other
58:09 experiment where you're sharing your
58:10 consciousness so I'm having a dream
58:12 about aliens because I'm reading the
58:13 book communion written by Whitley
58:15 Strieber and she is excited about the
58:17 fact she bought me origami paper she's
58:21 saying to herself at night he'll never
58:22 think of this so goes into a fictional
58:25 scenario of a of an alien I dream the
58:29 whole thing I've already got the clue
58:31 from her because of this carrier wave
58:33 and I wake up and I've got this scenario
58:36 thinking I met an alien doesn't explain
58:39 Walt Disney but it definitely splaine's
58:40 that alien we seem to create the
58:43 realities that we have right law of
58:45 attraction people who are pessimistic
58:48 lives shitty lives they do everything
58:51 that they fear especially happens those
58:56 of us who live very positive lives and
58:58 say you know what I'm not saying the
59:00 universe is my [ __ ] but
59:02 there's a relationship there you project
59:06 out which you want you're willing to put
59:08 whatever into it that you need to get it
59:11 done and it seems to happen it's pretty
59:13 amazing
59:14 try it might take you some practice for
59:16 a little while right and I want to leave
59:19 this with you and I might create an
59:21 entire episode about this but there's a
59:22 little precursor to my thinking this is
59:25 not exactly at all related to this
59:27 episode so there's a little bonus at the
59:29 end here now for those of you who've
59:31 never played World of Warcraft or a game
59:34 with downloadable content this will go
59:37 over your head a little bit but I'll try
59:38 to make it easy to understand it's not
59:41 gonna go over your head because you're
59:42 not smart it's just gonna go over your
59:43 head because you maybe haven't
59:44 experienced this before but I would say
59:47 even movie sequels are another way of
59:49 thinking about this which nearly all of
59:51 you have experienced right Blizzard
59:53 Entertainment is a huge game company
59:55 down the street in Irvine California
59:57 they create a game called world of
59:59 warcraft it has a continent when it was
60:02 first launched at two continents tons of
60:04 cities tons of dungeons and experiences
60:06 and quests and all kinds of stuff I mean
60:08 it took them about a hundred and forty
60:11 million dollars to make the first
60:12 version of the game that released in
60:14 2004 within a year the hardcore players
60:20 had experienced everything they were
60:21 level 60 the highest level you could go
60:23 they had played every dungeon a dozen
60:25 times if not a hundred times every piece
60:27 of gear you could possibly add and so
60:30 they just sat in limbo every time they
60:32 logged in they just did the same thing
60:33 over and over again grind and grind and
60:35 grind and they got bored of life in that
60:41 game until burning Crusades came out the
60:43 next expansion which created I think
60:46 it's called
60:46 badlands right and then they had a new
60:50 world to experience and they ate that
60:51 thing alive some people hit maximum
60:54 level within 24 hours some guy they did
60:57 eight hours because he was so buffed up
60:59 from the previous game yet everything so
61:01 he's just mowing through everything
61:02 really fast maybe he had to wait for his
61:05 friends to join him so he could do with
61:07 the dungeons and stuff but there might
61:11 be something to the universe
61:13 one of the reasons why we don't
61:15 understand everything and the reason why
61:18 you know characters in a book will never
61:20 be able to conceive of the writer that
61:22 wrote them simply because we might
61:27 exhaust all that has been created for us
61:29 to experience and you don't want to be
61:33 waiting around in this world for the
61:34 expansion pack for those of you that
61:37 writes when I was having the
61:38 conversation of my new friend Steve we
61:42 got to the point in conversation we're
61:44 talking about how characters write
61:45 themselves sometimes if you've ever
61:48 written a story for for a long period of
61:49 time say a month to six months to two
61:53 years or whatever the come a point when
61:56 the characters start to live on their
61:57 own inside your mind or somewhere else
62:00 just like dream characters in a dream if
62:05 you try to explain this to yourself in a
62:06 rational way you won't be able to do it
62:09 easily
62:09 you'll start to feel maybe your little
62:11 nuts to think that these characters live
62:13 on their own it was a great Twilight
62:15 Zone I think the last one season one
62:18 that has a guy that talks into a
62:20 dictaphone whatever he says becomes real
62:22 in the real world it's beautiful
62:24 beautiful idea some of the best endings
62:26 ever it's the only one I know that Rod
62:30 Serling is at the beginning of the
62:32 episode and at the end of the episode
62:33 and he's a character in a Twilight Zone
62:36 he's the only one but remember that
62:38 pinball thing we know that in a pinball
62:42 game it's governed by gravity the ball
62:44 is pushed down to the table and then it
62:47 is further pushed down but bumpers and
62:49 flippers and kickers and all kinds of
62:50 stuff if you tilt the Machine you can
62:52 mess with it we have no question as to
62:56 whether or not the pinball exists some
63:01 pinball games eventually introduced
63:02 additional balls you know two balls
63:04 sometimes you have like four or five of
63:06 them going at the same time by the way
63:08 the trick to beating that is to stare in
63:10 the center of the pinball machines field
63:13 don't stare at the flippers don't stare
63:14 at any of the balls it's there in the
63:16 center of the field and your peripheral
63:19 vision which has faster frame rates than
63:21 your your forward looking vision will
63:24 inform you where all these balls are and
63:26 you
63:26 be able to do all kinds of crazy [ __ ]
63:28 with four balls at once a little trick
63:31 for you from a pinball dude but what if
63:34 a pinball having its own consciousness
63:37 was not governed by gravity because it's
63:39 not really in this world but it can come
63:44 down and it can influence the ball
63:46 that's that your are playing with the
63:48 one that you do acknowledge that exists
63:50 and your ball starts doing weird stuff
63:52 it's bouncing off something that's not
63:54 on the field what's going on if you
63:58 write a story you open your mind up to
64:00 see things that you haven't seen before
64:02 you're seeing things in your mind it's a
64:04 daydream it's a day dream what if these
64:09 characters that you're writing are
64:11 merely being solicited out of the
64:13 universe to play a character in a story
64:15 they actually have their own
64:17 consciousness now as an actor if you've
64:20 ever been one before you will go onstage
64:22 and say you do Shakespeare well you
64:24 don't walk up to the director unless
64:26 you're doing a real modern
64:27 interpretation and question whether or
64:29 not Romeo and Juliet died at the end if
64:31 you negate that storyline you have
64:34 injured the entire power of the script
64:36 okay let's say you're making Star Wars
64:39 55 and you're Mark Hamill at the age of
64:43 190,000 and you know he reads the script
64:47 he's been doing this a long time and
64:49 he's done all kinds of other cartoon
64:51 voiceovers he's seen stories he's like I
64:53 know what a good story is and someone
64:56 wrote a crappy scene for him a crappy
64:58 line for him and he's like you know what
65:00 held are you
65:01 oh you're 24 how the hell did you get
65:03 this job oh your uncle owns the studio
65:05 got it all right let me get you hip to
65:08 something here
65:09 this line where I say no that's very
65:14 cliche ting stupid he may say this a lot
65:17 better than I'm saying right now a lot
65:19 more friendly he goes here's we're gonna
65:21 do Han Solo is not gonna get stabbed on
65:24 some stupid walkway and die by his son
65:26 it sounds so low man he's a badass he's
65:30 our ultimate hero his death has to be
65:34 unbelievable now his son can kill him
65:36 that's a great little turn there right
65:37 very predictable but whatever
65:40 but we're not going to just do this
65:42 stupid skewer with a lightsaber through
65:45 his chest we're going to make this epic
65:48 and here's how we're gonna do it boom
65:51 boom boom boom boom he describes it why
65:52 cuz he's got wisdom
65:53 he's been around he can mess with the
65:56 script and the writer if they're
65:59 intelligent we'll go damn and I get the
66:02 writing credit for your idea
66:03 sure do man I will I'm already an actor
66:06 with my own credit it's cool I just want
66:08 to act a good line I want to see this
66:09 perhaps I try to stop the Sun and Han
66:12 still gets it okay
66:14 made it better what I'm starting to
66:17 think is that the players in the scripts
66:19 in our mind they're willing to go along
66:23 with the script up to a point and then
66:25 sometimes they educate you considerably
66:28 so perhaps the act of writing is way
66:30 more powerful than anyone understands
66:32 because they don't understand the
66:33 universe they don't understand the
66:35 possibilities they come into play when
66:38 you take the whole universe and you make
66:40 it out of a throw winds but you raise
66:42 consciousness up to the pinball level of
66:46 its own unique life energy its own
66:48 identity its own memory banks wherever
66:50 that is stored you know when we have
66:54 memory in a computer it's a chip in your
66:57 computer right that's called memory and
66:59 don't get confused with hard disk but
67:01 it's the same sort of principle that's
67:03 storage but what's memory memory is this
67:08 thing that gets created in some dark
67:10 factory by robots all over the world and
67:13 gets shipped to us and we put it in our
67:14 machines and then it holds our memories
67:16 the stuff that we create our paintings
67:18 our drawings our files ok let's do this
67:23 the chip is ether winds the electrical
67:28 charges the positives and negatives
67:30 which make up the zeros and ones that
67:31 make up digital data that's the
67:34 consciousness that rides on top of the
67:36 ether a wind which is the chip think
67:39 about it
67:41 a non-player character in a videogame
67:43 meaning one that's been programmed to
67:45 talk to you it's not really a human
67:46 being somewhere in a laboratory talking
67:48 back to you it lives right now as I'm
67:52 sitting here talking to you there are
67:54 probably over 20,000 I don't even know
67:57 the number non player characters in
67:59 memory in over I don't know 50 75 100
68:04 servers that world of warcraft made by
68:07 Blizzard Entertainment has paid for on
68:11 some computer it's living it lives a
68:15 very tiny life it gives out perhaps food
68:18 so you can go prepare yourself you sends
68:23 you on a quest that makes you the real
68:24 living being go out and do something for
68:26 real inside memory it's a life maybe in
68:32 our world there are no automated
68:34 characters that are God's got some guy
68:37 working at a convenience store he's not
68:38 real but we go in there and we buy stuff
68:41 from we're like how could a guy work
68:42 work at this place oh he's a nun
68:44 player-character nope he's a real human
68:46 being he's got a passion and that's his
68:47 store
68:48 it's his sovereign world and you
68:50 interact with it every once in a while
68:52 so for those of you feel me hopefully
68:54 you've had a little bit of your frustum
68:58 of view and consciousness expanded just
69:00 a little bit if you want it if you're
69:03 interested in science and you want to
69:04 get into this my recommendation is this
69:06 if you're questioning this then go look
69:09 up all the skeptics about the Michelson
69:10 experiment and you'll recapture ether in
69:13 a very deep-rooted way if you just want
69:16 to move straight in go study ether study
69:20 the ones that believed in it study the
69:22 ones that found it measured its speed in
69:25 the universe and start from there why
69:28 get into the cynicism of its existence
69:29 when the people that were the smartest
69:31 they created the patents that we use to
69:33 have this show exist right now right
69:36 Einstein had nothing to do with what
69:39 you're experiencing on a daily basis and
69:41 I mean nothing okay so for being the
69:44 smartest guy that ever lived
69:46 okay he contributed nothing Tesla had
69:52 hundreds and hundreds of patents that
69:54 use every single day based on the
69:58 shoulders of the Giants that live before
69:59 him all the scientists Volta all the way
70:03 back to Faraday and all the people he
70:06 stood on the shoulders of we're
70:09 uncovering the truth slowly but if we
70:11 don't pay attention to those who
70:12 actually contributed to our reality and
70:14 those that have been theorizing [ __ ]
70:16 around our reality to confuse us
70:18 then we're losing let's be the let's be
70:23 the ones that focus on reality right if
70:27 you haven't been to deep thoughts
70:28 radio.com please go this video and audio
70:31 there's a lakh Facebook group there's a
70:33 patreon page for those who want to
70:35 contribute if you haven't liked and
70:37 subscribed do that again there's the
70:39 little bell I keep forgetting to tell
70:41 people the bells get shut off which is
70:44 really strange so you will click the
70:46 Bell and it will unclick itself it's
70:48 something that just happens to happen
70:50 you know in social media from time to
70:51 time to keep you from useful information
70:54 I if the bell unclicking is actually
70:57 occurring I don't use the bill that much
71:01 because I visit my feed my subscription
71:02 feed quite a bit then I think we can be
71:06 flattered right that we have good
71:07 information that is being unbelled and
71:09 if any of our stuff is being censored
71:11 than good that means that we're on the
71:12 right track that's a success again when
71:16 you only get the flack if you're over
71:18 the target right anyway take care of
71:21 yourself in someone else and I'll see
71:22 you in the next deep thoughts over
