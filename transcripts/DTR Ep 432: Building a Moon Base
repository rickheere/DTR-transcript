00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts I thought today we might
00:35 revisit the notion of what if I really
00:38 did want to go to the moon what would
00:40 that sort of program look like because
00:43 we would be talking about creating a
00:45 tremendous amount of undiscovered
00:46 technology right no matter how much
00:50 technology we have in the sub-systems
00:52 region we're missing a lion share of
00:59 basic proof basic systems right so I
01:03 think the initial question we should ask
01:07 is exactly what do we mean by go to the
01:11 moon because we've never been there
01:13 human beings have never ever ever been
01:16 there so you have to immediately unlike
01:20 any other form of science you have to
01:22 divorce yourself from all the lies that
01:25 have been told about going there because
01:27 there's a lot of fake technology and
01:29 fake lack of obstacles that we will then
01:33 have to overcome because we're actually
01:34 going to go there and of course if we
01:37 were smart we would do unmanned missions
01:41 first probably just reconnaissance then
01:45 we would do potentially robotic you know
01:51 Rovers get that completely worked out
01:54 then use the Rovers to pioneer all of
01:58 the knowledge about the moon's surface
01:59 its potential light atmosphere because
02:03 you know it does grab stuff towards it
02:05 what its soil is made out of may be just
02:09 sit and listen for a couple weeks and
02:11 see if there's any seismic seismograph
02:14 information who knows maybe even install
02:17 some seismograph sort of like what is it
02:22 the dune thumper
02:24 you know mechanisms to make sure we can
02:27 guarantee ourselves that the surface is
02:30 in volatile but before we could even get
02:33 a rover there we are talking about
02:38 overcoming a tremendous amount of
02:41 obstacles that is it is so tremendous
02:44 that the word tremendous honestly barely
02:48 touches the surface of what we're
02:51 talking about here now for those of you
02:54 you're flat earthers I respect you
02:56 rolling your eyes but if you're a flat
02:59 earther then maybe your version of this
03:02 mission is to get to the the sphere
03:05 that's above your floating disc 3200
03:09 miles up and when I said in one of my
03:11 episodes if you look at the moon or the
03:14 Stars or some moon and the Sun through a
03:16 sextant the world becomes flat that is
03:19 because both of the measure as I'm told
03:22 I haven't had a Sexton in years but that
03:26 they're 3,200 miles up according to the
03:28 Sexton if that's the case we're not on a
03:31 heliocentric ball we're on a flat disk
03:33 and so that was a sort of you know
03:36 roundabout way of acknowledging that
03:38 anomaly so for you maybe it's just
03:41 getting up to this really teeny thing in
03:43 this guy but for the sake of everyone
03:47 else heliocentric ball for the sake of
03:50 me expanding earth but it means nothing
03:52 except for the center of the course
03:54 electric and so is the center of the
03:57 Moon which may end up being a savior of
04:02 getting to the moon imagine we have
04:06 electrical core it has an electrical
04:08 core the same Tesla coil that Tesla
04:16 built in Colorado Springs but we just
04:19 build a Tesla tower on the moon sucking
04:22 out its plasma core which quite frankly
04:25 might be a lot more readily available
04:26 than the one that we have here because
04:28 perhaps it's crust is a lot thinner
04:31 again we have photographs of energy
04:33 spewing out of these volcanic craters on
04:37 the moon
04:37 remember all those craters aren't out
04:41 you know bodies from outer space the are
04:43 eruptions on the surface that's why
04:45 they're all spherical and none of them
04:46 are elliptical do rocks tumbled down
04:52 you know surfaces sure but that doesn't
04:54 mean they're meteorites
04:56 I'm not convinced there are meteorites
04:58 at all what we're seeing in the sky in
05:01 terms of a falling star will show me the
05:04 star going up it's a meteorite and I
05:07 will then acknowledge that their
05:09 meteorites but for now they're always
05:12 falling which negates an heliocentric
05:16 ball it negates a concept of something
05:22 constantly coming at earth and hitting
05:25 the surface of the earth you know
05:27 because eventually on a ball I would
05:30 look out at the coast and a meteorite
05:31 would go up because it's hitting lower
05:34 than my line-of-sight and it's coming up
05:36 and over never seen that I've talked to
05:38 a million people never heard that be the
05:41 case but let's see we want to go to the
05:44 moon the hell do we do we have to
05:48 develop a series of technologies that if
05:52 we are responsible to the program what
05:58 has to occur is that we create the most
06:02 efficient use of energy meaning perhaps
06:06 a Saturn five is the worst form of
06:09 getting to space but perhaps it is the
06:12 most energy efficient when you talk
06:14 about very low altitude mechanisms you
06:21 know what if we had anti-gravity but the
06:24 only place it really becomes plausible
06:28 in terms of the use of energy and
06:30 onboard systems and I'm making this up
06:33 of course that it becomes efficient at
06:37 100 miles up when you've really gotten
06:39 out of most of the thick goop that is
06:41 the you know sort of light liquid
06:44 atmosphere that we have here because
06:48 it's thick I mean our atmosphere is
06:49 thick when I can move my hand and feel
06:50 it on my top of my hand that's a pretty
06:53 thick atmosphere but we have to figure
06:57 out methods to get I think a significant
07:01 amount of core materials into orbit
07:05 I recently just watched a video that's
07:07 saying that you know 235 is typically
07:09 the the average orbital height of a NASA
07:15 mission you know that's that's the
07:17 orbital missions with human being space
07:19 stations and other shuttle missions back
07:22 in the day alright well then we have to
07:28 start constructing a real Space Station
07:31 not this ridiculous thing called the ISS
07:35 this space station which doesn't have a
07:38 portal window toward space right there's
07:42 something up there I guess but you know
07:47 the only thing that really is like the
07:49 proof that it's up there is when we you
07:52 know junior astronomers are you know
07:55 people with cameras watch it fly by the
07:56 moon maybe there's another way of doing
07:59 that that is believable that isn't
08:02 actually it's I don't know there's so
08:05 many anomalies with that thing people on
08:07 strings a bunch of the augmented reality
08:09 stuff up there it is just straight up
08:12 green screening there's something funky
08:16 with that whole program but if we're
08:18 ever to leave the earth or to attempt to
08:21 pierce the reality because why do we
08:23 have to leave earth in the first place
08:25 especially if there's no real earth
08:27 killing meteorites out there we'll be
08:31 just simply our inquisitive nature to
08:32 find out what's what's beyond here what
08:36 is that blanket of stars out there is
08:38 there really a Milky Way is this all a
08:41 big facade did we go up and bump into
08:43 water you know in terms of sending
08:47 things into low orbits with rockets
08:51 we've seen them take off several times
08:54 right I've seen this space shuttle
08:56 Challenger take off a Sally Ride on her
08:59 maiden voyage I have seen a space
09:01 shuttle land in the California desert I
09:04 did not hear you know jet sounds from it
09:09 I heard the sonic booms two or three
09:12 times boom boom boom boom and I look up
09:16 and this thing is upside down
09:18 hauling ass you could see it with your
09:21 naked eye and then it went from upside
09:23 down and it did this barrel roll boom
09:26 and landed up on its wheels so just
09:32 phenomenal because it wasn't a barrel
09:35 rolls like some loop-d-loop thing but
09:38 now we have to make a space station that
09:42 can I think have everything that we've
09:48 ever prophesized in a space station from
09:50 science fiction books to movies this
09:54 needs to be a colossal structure huge
10:00 potentially eventually because there's
10:03 no real estate issues in space it should
10:06 be about the size of a major city in my
10:09 opinion we need branches of science all
10:12 over this thing and we should probably
10:13 try to conquer artificial gravity as
10:16 well as rooms that are that have no
10:20 gravity but we need to attempt this
10:22 right we need to attempt it without
10:25 harming the human body there are
10:29 theories of you know the spaceship in
10:33 2010 a Space Odyssey from 1984 the one
10:37 that said me design where it rotates
10:38 right rotates the center of it the whole
10:41 thing doesn't have to be a wheel but for
10:44 the sake of gravity on the human body
10:46 digestive systems muscular development
10:49 bone development bone density we should
10:52 have the primary living quarters have
10:54 some form of gravity now that works
10:58 because collision between two mass
11:05 energy objects is going to work right if
11:07 there's nothing that stops it from you
11:10 know if a spaceship was coming at you or
11:12 a rock was coming at you in space the
11:14 size of a house at a hundred thousand
11:17 miles an hour and you were not going a
11:19 hundred thousand miles an hour you
11:21 aren't going to be able to stay in one
11:25 piece once it hits you you're going to
11:27 splatter on the side of it it's just
11:29 going to take place
11:31 so as this thing turns we've got gravity
11:35 we could take a shower we could send out
11:39 an e to meet at a table and as long as
11:41 it's gigantic we're okay
11:43 the entire space station should be
11:45 electrical by design because the Van
11:48 Allen belts provide infinite power the
11:52 method by which you gain the power from
11:54 the Van Allen belts would be to release
11:57 a wire on one end way out inside the way
12:01 outside the ship and it will collide
12:03 with electron clouds that you can
12:06 conductive ly bring back into the ship
12:08 and they probably don't even need to be
12:11 to be that long so you could have
12:13 infinite power up there without bringing
12:15 any batteries whatsoever well what's the
12:19 point of the space station well the
12:22 first point would be to actually set up
12:24 a laboratory and an observational Center
12:28 that is pointed at space unlike the ISS
12:31 so most of the windows or at least an
12:34 equal portion of windows are going to be
12:35 pointed at the galaxies at the moon at
12:39 the Sun at everything right and of
12:42 course we'll take into account sun
12:43 exposure and all that kind of stuff
12:46 we know how to block a tremendous amount
12:50 of the harmful rays from the Sun just
12:53 getting into a car with UV protection in
12:55 the windows you know if you've ever
12:57 driven across the country and you had
12:59 your left arm mount on them in America
13:01 it gets burned up but it only should
13:04 roll the window up put your arm inside
13:06 the window it might get really hot but
13:08 it won't get sunburned that's because we
13:11 have UV protection and all we need to do
13:13 if it gets more powerful is put more of
13:15 UV protection in there so we'll have to
13:18 figure out what we can do is we go
13:20 around the earth around the backside of
13:23 the earth where it's dark we can release
13:26 some of the shielding and get a better
13:27 deeper view into the deep space take
13:30 some photographs come back around where
13:32 the Sun is we lock it all back up and
13:35 maybe open up the windows towards the
13:36 earth you know it's very doable but as
13:40 part of the space station and I mean
13:41 this is absolutely serious ok
13:44 instead of all these really bizarre
13:48 apertures you know are they're trying to
13:50 do these cylinders that go out and talk
13:52 to some door that's compatible on a
13:55 space shuttle or in some other pod I
13:59 think that we should potentially be able
14:03 to put maybe raw materials inside more
14:06 bulky ships that come up they don't have
14:08 any sexiness to them and then when you
14:11 come up in some sort of space shuttle or
14:13 the starship from SpaceX you dock like a
14:17 normal spaceship into a space station we
14:22 can do this this is definitely a
14:24 possibility in low orbit in my opinion
14:27 but now building a big Space Station I
14:31 know that people are like well geez man
14:33 you're talking about lifting into the
14:35 sky metric tons of metal and all kinds
14:39 of other things and I'm not gonna argue
14:41 with that but there was a rail rail
14:45 system that was being tested
14:50 I believe in Australia or something
14:53 because of its proximity to space and
14:56 it's ocean surroundings that they were
14:59 going to try and use electromagnetic
15:03 rails to shove 500 pound parcels into
15:07 space in such a way that it could
15:09 rendezvous with your project in space so
15:14 it didn't take any propulsion whatsoever
15:15 it's literally just throwing it like if
15:17 you're seeing an earthquake it's
15:20 occurred and people are you know tossing
15:22 buckets back and forth you know they're
15:24 handing buckets in a big assembly line
15:26 it's the same sort of thing you're just
15:28 throwing them up they're throwing them
15:30 up they're throwing them up there and
15:31 then you just scoop them up it's
15:35 obviously a lot more complicated than
15:37 that but that would be something that we
15:38 might think about just to get raw
15:39 materials into space but if we had to
15:42 use traditional rocket systems and so be
15:44 it it's a gigantic thick heavy falcon
15:47 heavy 9 or whatever container full of a
15:52 maximum payload and then again here
15:54 comes this big round container
15:56 run into the bowels of your initial
15:58 architecture of your space station which
16:00 would probably start off like one of
16:02 those space stations it is the hangar
16:06 that goes around the enterprise back in
16:08 1979 right and you start getting your
16:13 materials together but think about if
16:16 you had infinite power up there because
16:19 of the Van Allen belts part of the
16:23 theories around fusion which is being
16:27 able to dismantle mass of one kind it's
16:30 all the same stuff right but then
16:31 reconstituted whatever you wanted so
16:33 taking straw and making it gold they'll
16:37 tell you you know they might be able to
16:41 theorize this but they say that the
16:43 amount of energy it would take to do
16:45 that is so high that it makes no sense
16:49 if the bar gold was worth $20,000 by the
16:53 time you're done but you had to spend
16:54 two million dollars worth of power to
16:56 get it to work what's the point well for
17:01 us being up in space and putting out
17:04 four or five wires and having this
17:06 fusion engine they can dismantle
17:09 molecules and then reconstitute them
17:13 imagine us in a chemical table realm
17:16 finding one of the most pliable forms of
17:20 mass on Earth's surface that can be
17:23 disassembled and it can be turned into
17:25 this other material I mean for you know
17:29 let me give you a bad example a ham
17:31 sandwich say ham sandwich is really easy
17:32 to dismantle you could turn it into iron
17:35 and platinum whatever led and so we
17:43 bring up there the stuff that's easiest
17:46 to destroy and the easiest to recreate
17:50 into something else
17:51 using the Advanta belts there's no
17:53 problem with power and so now we can
17:57 start constructing shielding floor
17:59 plates plumbing every single element
18:02 that we need now in terms of cables and
18:06 computers and all that kind of stuff
18:08 well maybe we start using digital print
18:10 Digital 3d printing for microchips and
18:14 things
18:15 well we shield them wrap them up in a
18:18 nice container that's all nice shielded
18:20 and shipped them up there such that by
18:23 the time they're unwrapped they're in a
18:24 safe zone such that we can use them
18:28 without them frying due to radiation
18:29 hitting the silicon chip no EMP right
18:34 die aya I honestly believe that the
18:37 trick for living in space safely is to
18:41 fabricate an external shell to your
18:44 space station that adheres to the
18:47 Faraday cage principle the way the
18:50 Faraday cage algorithm works and you can
18:52 go see it at natural wealth Science
18:54 Museum's I saw it first in Boston where
18:56 a guy put his arms on the inside of a
18:58 cage while a million seven million volts
19:01 hit him from a Tesla coil and it didn't
19:04 shock him but it looks like it's hitting
19:06 his arm is that you have to generate an
19:10 electrical discharge that is of a
19:14 unified frequency so it can't be varying
19:17 in frequency much because then it will
19:19 crawl through the cage and zap your arms
19:21 and burn you kill you well I'm assuming
19:24 that the vanilla belts have a fairly
19:27 constant frequency I'm hoping that's the
19:31 case and so we build a multi-layered a
19:37 new particle system fabric vetted every
19:42 layer and perhaps we just keep
19:44 increasing the the you know the diameter
19:47 of the box as it goes further and
19:48 further out multiple layers such that
19:50 even in different frequencies it can
19:52 only go through so many layers before it
19:54 dissipates at the same time we need to
19:58 take the external fabric of our space
20:00 station and metabolize the electrons
20:03 that hit it
20:04 therefore we no longer have to put out
20:06 there wires and stuff to grab the
20:08 electron clouds from the Van Allen belts
20:10 so we have probably 99.9% of the power
20:14 being dissipated somehow at 1% of the
20:17 power which is way more than we would
20:19 ever need there for all of our
20:22 subsystems and all of our
20:24 abrogation systems but we would need a
20:26 gigantic warehouse eventually closed off
20:31 where astronauts could fabricate things
20:34 in 3d printers full-blown fusion systems
20:39 so the fusion systems are breaking down
20:41 raw materials that feed the 3d printing
20:44 systems to build more complex I beams
20:46 and all kinds of other things now the
20:49 nice thing about having some form of
20:52 fusion system is that you could very
20:56 theoretically generate all the pure
20:58 oxygen you would ever need to breathe up
21:00 there we would also want to start doing
21:04 something that I don't think we've ever
21:05 really done which is create some sort of
21:07 Agra dome a place that floats with our
21:10 space station such that we have a garden
21:17 and you know you're the NASA published
21:19 G's 20 years ago but the amount of grass
21:23 healthy grass necessary to feed a one
21:27 human being is a 10 foot by 10 foot
21:30 square as long as it can get co2 to
21:33 breathe it can produce oxygen out and
21:36 human beings okay so imagine having
21:39 imagine having most of your oxygen
21:41 provided by perhaps an Agra dome at
21:45 every so so many intervals of feet or
21:51 meters along the space station so you
21:54 have one on one side one on the other
21:55 side it feeds the center you want to get
21:58 even bigger you put one on top of the
21:59 center and everyone's breathing the most
22:02 pure beautiful oxygen ever what else
22:07 would a space station want to have it's
22:11 gonna want to have an observatory to
22:13 beat all observatories ever developed by
22:16 man
22:16 of course the Hubble telescope of which
22:19 we believe is the Sofia project in
22:21 hiding sofia projects the public project
22:25 my cousin has pretty good proximity to
22:28 that project
22:28 it's a 747 with a beautiful camera in it
22:31 that flies way way up there and then
22:34 tilt sideways and take these amazing
22:35 shots of space
22:37 so we need something of equal caliber or
22:40 greater caliber I think we have to push
22:42 the envelope pretend like Steve Jobs is
22:45 in charge of the space station right
22:47 Elon Musk seems to be a pretty good
22:50 dreamer but we need the biggest and
22:52 baddest observatory so we can start
22:54 looking at the moon looking at the
22:56 planets looking at deep deep space stuff
22:59 and really start to understand this
23:01 place where we live right the other
23:04 thing is the space station needs to be
23:05 clean no more you know wires everywhere
23:10 our laptops everywhere and all this
23:13 crazy stuff it needs to feel like a
23:15 normal living breathing place we need to
23:18 have designers come in that actually
23:20 take care of the human condition while
23:23 you're up there so this base station if
23:26 I just you know if you're keeping track
23:28 of the bits and pieces and I say it's as
23:31 big as perhaps New York City's Manhattan
23:34 borough you don't talking about a big
23:38 place and we're probably talking about
23:41 similar to the way it takes 300 years to
23:44 build a cathedral or even 500 to a
23:47 thousand years to build a cathedral yeah
23:49 it might take two or three hundred years
23:51 to build this thing properly up there
23:54 and to go through all the trials and
23:55 tribulations now apparently my camera I
23:59 forgot to plug it in and even though it
24:02 should have plenty of power to record 25
24:04 minutes for whatever reason it didn't so
24:07 I think I'm just going to continue
24:09 releasing this with a tremendous amount
24:11 of pictures in place of my face so you
24:15 see this video it's a little bit weird
24:16 that's what's going on there but we have
24:19 to get this thing built get it just
24:24 figured out before we try something
24:27 crazy like deep space travel which
24:32 honestly getting to the moon would be
24:34 sort of the entry level of deep space in
24:37 my opinion you don't have to leave the
24:39 solar system you don't have to go to
24:40 Jupiter because if we're really going to
24:42 do this we're really going to do this
24:43 right once we finish a space station we
24:49 have apply
24:50 form that can conduct just about every
24:53 single experiment than we can imagine to
24:58 keep man alive in the hostile conditions
25:00 of which we are not meant to be and this
25:04 is something that we don't really talk
25:05 about much you know we're not supposed
25:07 to be but ten you know honestly speaking
25:12 we're not supposed to live at the South
25:13 Pole we're not supposed to live at the
25:14 North Pole
25:15 we're not supposed to live in outer
25:17 space because if we were we would have
25:19 naturally formed out there or if you
25:21 believe in creation we would have
25:23 naturally been created out there right
25:26 but just imagine all of the experiments
25:29 that potentially we've already done I
25:32 you know I have my doubts because you
25:35 know what would be the point of creating
25:37 experiments in space would be to create
25:40 new materials here on earth to justify
25:43 spending billions of dollars every
25:45 single year on this thing called NASA
25:47 right what is it 20 billion a year okay
25:51 how is my life down here on earth the
25:55 slightest bit improved due to these
25:58 people playing house up there in space I
26:00 don't know I mean you tell me because it
26:03 it's it used to be they'd create
26:05 polymers or something else up there then
26:08 it just kind of went away it was kind of
26:09 like they realize no one gave a [ __ ] and
26:11 so they'll stop doing this stupid stuff
26:14 okay you know you'll see ISS you know
26:18 episodes where they're flying around the
26:23 the space station and then there'll be
26:25 some hokey ass experiment at the end of
26:28 one of the tubes and there's some guy in
26:30 there with his laptop you know he's
26:33 already in the room and then the guy
26:35 giving the - or the girl giving the tour
26:36 oh sorry oh hey how you doing yeah what
26:40 are you doing here well I've got this
26:41 Folgers coffee can and a parachute and
26:44 I'm studying how water you know behaves
26:49 in outer space when you throw a penny in
26:51 it you know but a real bona fide space
26:54 station is going to get at the heart of
26:58 everything that we've ever wanted to do
27:00 in space but then you know the other
27:03 thing is we have to
27:04 assume that there's a lot of anomalies
27:06 in space that we've never bumped into so
27:09 we have to be extra careful and make as
27:13 many plans as possible contingency plans
27:16 on how to deal with well we're gonna try
27:19 this if it doesn't work then maybe this
27:21 happens and if that happens we need to
27:23 try something else I just keep going
27:26 down the line until we sort of cover all
27:29 the bases right and if the ISS is indeed
27:34 real and for some reason all this green
27:36 screen stuff that we keep seeing
27:39 astronauts on wires that have been wiped
27:41 out it with with special effects
27:43 software which is the conclusive fact
27:46 about the ISS footage then let's get to
27:50 it let's fix this stuff for real we may
27:55 find out that we can't grow a crop in
27:58 space for some weird reason we have to
28:04 have a contingency plan for that I think
28:07 it's safe to say that we can generate as
28:09 much power in space as we need so in
28:11 terms of the devices that man has sort
28:16 of given up on because man doesn't have
28:20 infinite power here on earth we can then
28:23 resurrect those inventions and say look
28:25 power is free up in space its priors for
28:27 young the surface of the earth - but
28:29 we're not allowed to know that mr. JP
28:30 Morgan Rothschild once what's the next
28:35 thing we have to conquer though for real
28:37 not NASA's fake return to the moon in
28:40 2024 or 2028 or whenever they say but to
28:44 really do it again why do they have
28:46 these ridiculous deadlines you know
28:50 typically a deadline in the construction
28:52 project is aimed at controlling costs
28:54 but you know what if we again we just
28:57 simply say cathedrals take you know up
29:01 to a thousand years to create but we
29:03 have no problem working on what is it
29:06 gaudi's Spanish Cathedral and I think
29:10 it's Madrid or you forgot what other
29:12 place it might be but we have no problem
29:15 working on that
29:17 Sistine Chapel no Troodon so we should
29:22 be able to endure a certain amount of
29:26 money every single year to build this
29:28 thing to just advance but understand at
29:34 all times we're bringing everything with
29:36 us to exist in space because we're not
29:38 supposed to be there and of course man
29:42 doesn't like to have any limitations and
29:44 I respect that if we had said we are not
29:47 supposed to live at the bottom of the
29:48 ocean then and we just you know throw up
29:51 our hands then we would never know
29:53 what's down there but we built machines
29:55 to get us down there it's part of the
29:57 adventure in my opinion to explore so
30:02 the Van Allen belts would be the next
30:03 thing - completely and utterly explore
30:08 now imagine you did build a space
30:10 station that took into account the Van
30:12 Allen belt radiation even though you're
30:15 not high enough to really be in its
30:17 bosom you're still getting the effects
30:20 of it you're still getting radiation
30:21 effects and what if we develop a
30:23 material that I haven't even conceived
30:26 of that allows us to control 100% the
30:30 electrical missions from natural space
30:33 as well as everything else thermal
30:35 emissions and we're able to create
30:40 things for instance like a force field
30:45 you know like it's Star Trek you have
30:48 shields well what are shields shields
30:51 would be an electromagnetic Van Allen
30:54 belt around the contour of your vehicle
30:58 emanating from some incredible power
31:00 source which in the fictional series
31:03 Star Wars is all based on dilithium
31:05 crystals which i think is phenomenal
31:08 because if you listen to Bob lazarre's
31:11 element 115 theory he's talking about an
31:17 element that when it goes through some
31:19 piezo effect creates an amazing
31:21 whirlwind of electron radiation / cloud
31:28 that's then fed into antimatter engines
31:30 which then make the vehicle move all
31:33 right so it's a theory but if we're able
31:36 to keep and stabilize a space station we
31:42 could build a sub vehicle
31:44 I mean seriously a vehicle the size of
31:47 perhaps you know some of those
31:50 hydroplaning vehicles that you see it's
31:53 big it's like a big boat and it we just
31:56 unmanned just move it up there into the
32:00 Van Allen belts and just put a bunch of
32:02 sensors on it and communication
32:04 equipment on it such that it beamed
32:05 straight back to the space station
32:07 doesn't have to go to earth we can relay
32:09 it to earth if we need to and then BOOM
32:13 we watch what happens and by putting
32:17 sensors in the center of our of our boat
32:19 we simply look at the radiation that was
32:22 able to be blocked by this Van Allen
32:24 belt and stick it you know again it
32:26 starts at 1,000 miles
32:27 we're told 25,000 miles thick fine so
32:32 put it about 16,000 miles up in the
32:35 belly of the Van Allen belts and you
32:38 need to understand that the Van Allen
32:40 belts density and lethal nature is most
32:44 likely lightest at the equator and most
32:48 volatile at the poles because this is
32:50 the poles is where it ejects and where
32:52 it comes back in and so if you've
32:55 watched a drain of water it's the same
32:58 kind of principle you've got water
33:00 floating in a bathtub way towards the
33:03 back it's moving very slowly but by the
33:04 time it gets to the vortex which is the
33:06 drain it starts to go really quickly
33:07 same thing plus the inner motor of the
33:12 earth is going to blast this stuff
33:14 through very very quickly now it's
33:16 probably moving very quickly regardless
33:17 so we need to pay attention to where we
33:20 are in the Van Allen belts in all three
33:22 dimensions to figure out its most lethal
33:24 nature once we have figured out how to
33:28 keep the vehicle from vaporizing itself
33:31 from harming any of the biological
33:34 matter inside I mean what if we just
33:37 fill it full of a bunch of single-celled
33:39 creatures put it up there 16 thousand
33:43 miles and then bring it back
33:44 down in the Space Station bringing
33:46 inside the docking bay open it up we can
33:49 examine the outside of the vehicle in an
33:51 oxygen oxygen aided environment people
33:55 just walking around it you know it'd be
33:56 nice right you could say Oh kacica this
33:58 this seem to boil off oh this wire is
34:00 all gone right here this fabric seemed
34:02 to melt you know we got to go to the
34:05 next level or it's perfectly fine and
34:07 they open it up and they take the little
34:09 petri dishes out and they look at the
34:11 cells and the cells are happy as a clam
34:14 or dead or maybe mutated into something
34:16 special who knows right that's why the
34:20 space station exists
34:21 it's to conquer the basics of being in
34:25 space it's also to get through the Van
34:28 Allen belts and then we have another
34:30 realm on the other side of the Van Allen
34:32 belts which we've never really been to
34:34 which is essentially technically non
34:39 occupied space but it is obviously very
34:42 radioactive because of the Sun because
34:44 of emissions from the earth
34:45 I suspect event Allen belts are much
34:50 thicker than they say it's just 25,000
34:53 miles would be a nice estimate as to the
34:55 most lethal band of the Van Allen belts
34:59 but then we have hundreds of thousands
35:02 of miles before you get to the get to
35:04 the moon out there which is a to 36
35:06 through 37 somewhere in there depending
35:08 on when you access the moon and it's
35:10 supposedly elliptical orbit I think it's
35:14 interesting that when I was a kid they
35:15 didn't really talk about the moon have
35:17 an elliptical orbit I didn't talk about
35:19 the earth have any elliptical orbit but
35:21 now supposedly it's just common
35:23 knowledge I think that's interesting so
35:26 the next phase would be to then study
35:31 and make sure and I'm pretty sure if you
35:34 can get through the lethal bands of the
35:35 Van Allen belts we're gonna be just fine
35:37 when we get on the other side but
35:39 perhaps something that it is protecting
35:42 us from would not be inside the vanilla
35:45 belts let's just say some other wave of
35:48 energy that isn't visible that isn't
35:52 part of the Van Allen belts but once you
35:54 get on the other side it starts to
35:55 penetrate the hole
35:57 and injure the human flesh inside
36:02 biological mess so we just need to make
36:04 sure by continuing to put our boat up
36:07 and down up and down in an altitude and
36:10 testing and then bringing it back and
36:12 then testing it and bringing it back
36:15 what's going on now you might ask - what
36:18 would be the propulsion system of our
36:20 ship the little guy that would go up
36:22 there well I would suggest that we start
36:28 to play with electromagnetic engines
36:31 which is to say we generate a vehicle
36:34 design of which doesn't exist on public
36:37 publicly accessible paper at this point
36:39 although I will say and I routinely
36:43 forget to mention this when I first
36:46 started waking up in probably 2005 a
36:49 bunch of videos were put online that are
36:51 now gone once the deep state bought
36:55 YouTube right there were professors in
36:58 the 60s giving these lectures and
37:03 drawing on the white board
37:06 electromagnetic engines that would warp
37:09 space and allow us to create essentially
37:14 voids and what I believe to be voids of
37:18 ether thus allowing the vehicle to pop
37:21 into that position and fill up the void
37:23 because once you could avoid in space
37:25 everything else is pushing on the
37:27 vehicle in all directions which is ether
37:29 which again is water on bubble if you
37:32 could have a bubble in your soda and you
37:35 could just suspend an ice like a you
37:38 know centimeter diameter bubble and then
37:41 all of a sudden if you could just with
37:43 your mind power right as my enforces
37:47 Tenacious D would say create a pocket
37:49 where there's no water around the bubble
37:52 you know the bubble would just be forced
37:54 to go into that hole because it's not
37:56 being pushed
37:57 wherever the hole is so it's the same
38:00 exact principle except using I believe
38:04 very powerful fields of electromagnetic
38:07 currency or currents I should say we
38:10 will be able to create our own little
38:12 pocket around the vehicle it's it's very
38:14 similar to bob lazar theory of his
38:17 sports model UFO so that would be the
38:22 propulsion system that i would love to
38:24 see tested at this gigantic space
38:26 station now whether or not on earth we
38:29 could have a power system that could
38:31 lift the whole thing into space from
38:34 Earth's surface again fighting the the
38:37 liquid nature of our atmosphere and its
38:40 thickness may not be possible we should
38:43 try but we'll see if we could get a
38:47 vehicle like that created then we no
38:49 longer have to do all of this crazy
38:51 trajectory
38:53 you know astrophysics to get a vehicle
38:58 to the moon to then do some Michael
38:59 Collins orbit to do a rendezvous with
39:02 you know lunar module service module all
39:05 that stuff because all you would have to
39:07 do is drive to the moon
39:11 straight straight line don't need to
39:14 worry about orbit now of course once you
39:18 do land on the moon with this potential
39:21 new invention you have to figure out a
39:24 way to get off the moon because now
39:26 you're in the moon's a gravitational
39:27 force and so there's we don't know we
39:32 don't know exactly what it would take to
39:33 pull that off again the dynamite that
39:37 blew up underneath the the lunar module
39:41 top part that pushed it into space I
39:43 mean come on how would they know how
39:45 much dynamite would be necessary to pull
39:47 that off even if you thought that the
39:49 moon had 1/6 gravity if the moon turned
39:52 out to have even an infinitesimal amount
39:54 of atmosphere of which doesn't distort
39:57 light you know see because we click up
39:59 the moon it's pretty crystal clear once
40:02 we get to our own atmosphere maybe it
40:05 has a tiny little atmosphere because it
40:06 is what it is maybe it's just dust and
40:09 so you detonate this dynamite and you
40:12 start hitting all this dust and this
40:13 other thickness which will create
40:17 inertia and you no longer hit that orbit
40:20 that they faked in 1969
40:23 but now imagine instead of having to
40:28 launch it from a Saturn five out of Cape
40:30 Canaveral with a bunch of preexisting
40:33 constraints if we started from a space
40:35 station like von Braun initially
40:37 suggested a Disney animated 1956 of
40:41 which then Stanley Kubrick blew out in
40:44 you know 2001 a Space Odyssey gorgeously
40:49 we could technically speaking maybe
40:52 build a craft that is one extremely
40:54 large compared to the lunar module and
40:57 put in its belly a capacitated reservoir
41:02 of electricity gained from the Van Allen
41:04 belts gained from its trip such that
41:07 when it needs to create the void
41:08 directly over the ship to suck it back
41:10 into space it has all that electricity
41:14 capacitated already in its belly which
41:18 is why when we first go there we do not
41:20 want to send a man on it the first trip
41:24 right we want to send just a vehicle but
41:28 I think that we would want to conduct a
41:31 tremendous number of experiments flying
41:34 through space with this vehicle getting
41:37 close to the moon and coming back
41:39 getting closer to the moon and coming
41:41 back and just simply watch to see is
41:44 there something up there that's going to
41:45 be in the way is there something up that
41:47 we need to compensate for and they will
41:50 be able to actually have the science
41:52 that they didn't have in 69 to do these
41:54 miraculous outrageous maneuvers for the
41:57 very first time picture-perfect six
42:00 times almost in a row - Apollo 13 which
42:04 obviously had some drama attached to its
42:07 fictional storyline right which is an
42:09 explosion that happens outside the
42:11 service module of which only had a
42:12 paragraph of nonsensical theory about
42:16 what actually would do such a thing
42:18 the idea is if you if you have a car in
42:23 in Formula One or the poor woman that
42:26 just passed away going 500 miles an hour
42:28 in the was at the salt flats of Utah
42:33 they know what happens right she
42:37 because her front wheel ruptured while
42:40 she was going 500 miles an hour thank
42:43 God she probably felt nothing when a
42:45 Formula One car goes bad or a stock car
42:48 goes bad we can always figure out what
42:50 went wrong because there's only so many
42:52 things in the car that would cause
42:54 certain types of behaviors so when the
42:57 lunar module and the in the service
43:00 module were going towards the moon in
43:02 Apollo 13 there's supposedly this
43:03 explosion fairly early on in the mission
43:05 and while they just couldn't figure out
43:08 what went wrong they'll offer you
43:10 theories but there shouldn't be any
43:13 problem making that a very conclusive
43:15 forensics experiment okay now what would
43:18 be our overall objective with getting to
43:20 the moon in general well you know part
43:25 of it is just the curiosity of man which
43:27 we definitely poopoo I think a little
43:29 too much it's a very real thing we're
43:32 tired of the pattern in our mind of
43:34 Earth and what it has to offer on one
43:36 level I mean technically 99% of us
43:40 haven't seen even a fraction of the
43:43 Earth's surface but for those who have
43:46 and just for the mere principle of man
43:48 we want to get to this mysterious ball
43:51 on the sky we want to know what it is
43:54 why is it seen to be made out of
43:56 something that's completely different
43:57 than what the Earth's surface is made
43:59 out of because it's pure white dust it
44:03 seems bizarre doesn't it why would a
44:07 moon be totally atypical to the earth
44:12 it's right here because if you believe
44:16 especially in some evolutionary model of
44:18 how the universe creates itself well
44:20 then why would the raw materials of
44:22 Earth's surface be absolutely devoid
44:24 from the raw materials of the surface of
44:26 the Moon and I mean in in just
44:29 observable sense I mean what is it 99.9
44:33 percent completely different I mean
44:35 maybe if we theorize there's some ice
44:37 which would take water of some sort or
44:40 co2 on the caps which we don't seem to
44:43 see this is make any sense and this idea
44:48 that simply because it's a bigger ball
44:49 it starts to then
44:50 associate itself with a certain spectrum
44:53 of materials meaning the closer you get
44:57 to the size of Mars then you get iron
44:59 dust and you get the size of Earth you
45:01 get dirt soil and oceans you know it's
45:06 it's easy just to blow past that but I
45:08 think that the moon is a very very
45:11 mysterious place and arthur c clarke i
45:15 think did a brilliant job with his
45:17 notion that there was a monolith and i'm
45:19 not seeing this from a I bet this is
45:21 true standpoint but I'm saying this is a
45:23 very interesting beacon from our Creator
45:25 to us to simply say getting to the moon
45:28 is most definitely a milestone for men
45:31 and what if there were things up there
45:34 that's you know a plaque that simply
45:36 says good job mankind your next task is
45:39 to get to Mars you know so the other
45:43 idea is we might be able to create
45:45 something on the moon that makes it much
45:47 easier for us to get off the moon so
45:50 imagine us putting some sort of base but
45:55 it's uninhabited but it has the
45:57 mechanism that can eject us the space
45:59 without having to have a fairly detailed
46:03 propulsion system so you know that the
46:06 was in three thousand one a Space
46:08 Odyssey with arthur c-- clark the notion
46:11 that you can create a tower an antenna
46:13 all the way from the Earth's surface
46:15 straight up into the Van Allen belts for
46:19 instance they're talking about trying to
46:21 create you know these elevators that's
46:26 what they're called they're like the
46:27 space elevators they can go up there and
46:28 again you're hitting electromagnetic
46:31 poles of the earth and then you could
46:33 beam power down to the earth and have
46:35 infinite power it's a completely
46:37 unnecessary because we do have infinite
46:39 power here on a bot on the surface of
46:41 Earth imagine us constructing through
46:44 robotics okay these modules that we
46:49 construct them in space using our fusion
46:52 systems our 3d printing systems using
46:55 raw materials from the surface of the
46:56 earth and then we get them to the moon
46:59 and robots simply assemble them together
47:02 you know there's going to be some winds
47:04 and some and some losses in doing that
47:07 but we eventually put this together such
47:10 that when we want to get to the moon
47:11 maybe all we need to do is get our
47:13 little boat ship to rendezvous with the
47:16 elevator that then takes us down to the
47:19 surface of the Moon and then when we
47:21 need to leave we come back up the
47:22 elevator get in our little ship and come
47:24 back home because our motor our ether
47:28 all void motor gets us back to the space
47:31 station you've seen you know bridges
47:35 built right several times how do they
47:38 build a bridge they're redoing all the
47:39 bridges in Orange County and all the way
47:41 up Los Angeles because they are
47:42 expanding the highway of the 405 which
47:45 is you know already like nine lanes on
47:47 both sides okay
47:49 well how do they do it they build a
47:53 scaffolding made out of wood and then
47:57 some eye beams and then more wood and
48:00 then they cast the bridge on top of
48:04 those temporary structures with rebar
48:07 and a bunch of other stuff to make it
48:09 super strong sometimes they'll
48:11 incorporate obviously the eye beams into
48:13 the bridge but even if they suspend it
48:15 with eye beams they're putting by beams
48:17 on top of those eye beams to make the
48:19 bridge out of it
48:20 so it's SuperDuper strong it's a
48:23 phenomenal science so I think it's safe
48:26 to say that if we're going to build some
48:27 sort of initial Space Station docking
48:30 system that we might build a bunch of
48:32 throwaway structures that are simply
48:35 there to get us to the next level where
48:37 we don't need those structures anymore
48:39 and then we can cannibalize them for
48:41 more sophisticated structures afterwards
48:45 right by the way as a digression you
48:48 know what I was a kid and I looked at
48:50 the pyramids of giza and the fact that
48:53 the outer layer of non-conductive
48:55 limestone was removed they always said
48:59 that was stolen by people that wanted to
49:02 build something else with those stones
49:04 the truth and matter is probably more
49:08 that they took off the outer layer of
49:10 the non-conductive limestone to simply
49:13 deactivate the the unit
49:17 and this could have been done in the
49:20 1800's when they dug the thing out this
49:22 could have been done you know did five
49:25 thousand ten thousand years ago who
49:27 knows because we don't see structures in
49:31 the local area built out of those lime
49:33 stones so there's no evidence that
49:35 anyone took off the lime stones to build
49:37 some other structure just something I
49:39 thought I'd throw in there but now the
49:41 other thing that we've never done on the
49:44 moon is excavate the moon to see sort of
49:47 what's down there
49:49 we need to probably do some drilling and
49:53 I mean real drilling like we do here on
49:55 earth for oil wells to see just
49:57 generally what's the crust of the moon
49:59 made out of so that we can theorize
50:02 about what we can do in terms of
50:04 building subsurface bases because that
50:10 would be a fairly intelligent thing to
50:11 do if it's indeed safe now if the
50:14 surface of the Moon is constantly
50:17 erupting volcano volcanic energy then
50:22 its it might be that what we discover
50:24 about the moon but we discover it you
50:27 know unanimously and definitively is
50:30 that the moon may be too hostile for us
50:32 to live on it may just be that way and
50:35 we have to be willing to accept that so
50:40 there could be issues where we have to
50:43 then change our plan in order to live
50:44 down there just like we put bases on
50:47 these skis in the South Pole because
50:50 it's too hostile to stay in one place we
50:53 may have to build more mobile bases that
50:56 can be moved around and taken to areas
50:58 that are less volatile we may find again
51:00 the Sea of Tranquility is a lot more
51:02 stable than other areas but what we want
51:05 to do is explore as much as we possibly
51:07 can because obviously the moon has a lot
51:11 of whatever the moon is made out of and
51:13 we need to figure out exactly what that
51:15 is to see if we can metabolize that and
51:18 other more constructive materials that
51:21 we can use to build a base but now let's
51:25 say let's just say we get our wishes the
51:28 base is finished we have now conquered
51:31 most of what is volatile about the moon
51:35 then what what's the point if we have a
51:41 gigantic Space Station in essentially
51:45 low orbit and we know how to get through
51:48 the Van Allen belts safely and we build
51:50 bigger ones and multiple ones and maybe
51:53 we even attach them together I mean we
51:55 could build a ring around the the earth
51:57 potentially okay then
52:02 I mean imagine this is going to be super
52:04 fantasy for our current technologies but
52:08 imagine that we could through
52:09 electromagnetic manipulation with
52:11 essentially infinite power metabolised
52:14 II throw particles straight out of the
52:16 universe to forge whatever materials
52:18 that we want so it's essentially mass
52:19 out of energy free then we don't have to
52:24 borrow from the Earth's surface anymore
52:26 there's the was that the Dyson Sphere
52:29 theory which is you build a big sphere
52:32 around the largest orbital body you have
52:36 in your solar system around the Sun and
52:38 then you encapsulate all the energy of
52:40 the Sun and theoretically speaking you
52:42 would have infinite power and infinite
52:44 resources to do whatever you need to do
52:46 a Dyson Sphere a Dyson Sphere could only
52:49 be created metabolizing the utter ether
52:54 of space maybe it takes a hell of a lot
52:56 of ether to make anything and so it may
53:00 take a long time to build such a thing
53:03 but a space station on the moon could be
53:06 as in most things on earth sort of a a
53:10 base that is our intermediary base to
53:13 explore space because then we would be
53:15 outside the Van Allen belts in general
53:17 if every resource we have in our space
53:20 station and every resource we have on
53:22 earth is then duplicated on the moon in
53:25 a in a sustainable manner then it's our
53:30 it's our jump off point for everything
53:32 it's our staging Launchpad for
53:35 everything else that could be done in
53:36 space then we have a platform and we
53:41 could go to potentially every other
53:43 planet
53:44 with superior technology having spent
53:47 maybe one to five hundred years
53:50 pioneering this technology getting it
53:52 absolutely 100% safe and then the sky's
53:57 the limit
53:58 now let's say that all of that sounds
54:02 fairly plausible and that would be a bit
54:06 of a stretch of course because I just
54:09 introduced a tremendous amount of
54:10 theoretical discovery and theoretical
54:13 invention which because at least because
54:17 we we allow our government and rich you
54:22 know class structure individuals to hide
54:26 you know thousands and thousands of
54:29 patents and technology and we allow them
54:34 to hoard it away from us were what I
54:38 just said sounds probably more science
54:41 fiction or even science fantasy than it
54:45 does science fiction I've been trying to
54:48 think for the last you know several
54:50 weeks is there an area of is there area
54:58 of technology in the world where we
55:00 really believe that we have seen the
55:04 byproduct of advanced technologies that
55:07 are not known to ban but we get to see
55:10 it I give an example the b-1 stealth
55:15 bomber or the b-2 stealth bomber excuse
55:17 me and then there's the new b-2 stealth
55:18 bomber the new one it could be theorized
55:22 that the fabric of that vehicle is made
55:28 out of a bunch of you know low you know
55:31 radar absorbent materials that are you
55:36 know in our realm they don't exist but
55:38 in the Lockheed Martin you know
55:41 wright-patterson Air Force Base designs
55:44 it's completely possible to exist it
55:48 does exist right the interesting thing
55:51 about a real Space Station project is
55:53 that we would need to get
55:56 you know very unexcited government
55:59 employees and government commanders and
56:02 folks that hold the purse strings to be
56:07 so excited that they're willing to sort
56:09 of loosen the purse strings if you will
56:12 on our patent black out on our
56:16 technology blackout because what is it
56:19 that they don't want to do let's just
56:20 say the United States of America and
56:23 perhaps maybe Russia has have devised
56:27 methods to create infinite power we know
56:30 that that's possible in many different
56:32 manners some are possible on earth by
56:35 metabolizing you know hydrogen out of
56:37 water and you have stayin Meyers clean
56:39 water burning engine that God ever
56:42 killed 1998 go see my episode on Stan
56:44 Meyers but then we have you know
56:48 potentially directed energy weapons from
56:49 space like your standard command &
56:52 Conquer ion cannon design that can only
56:56 exist if you're in space because you can
57:00 tap into that infinite stream of
57:01 electrons to then capacitate up and then
57:04 direct down an energy beam to liquify
57:07 say 110 storey building okay
57:12 the nice thing about the space station
57:15 theory according to me is that you would
57:17 then have almost this beautifully
57:20 quarantine zone where unless you and I
57:23 are invited up there and we're super
57:25 scientists we will never see this
57:28 technology that they have had discovered
57:30 for potentially thousands and thousands
57:32 of years but we don't have access to it
57:35 because it would give us too much power
57:36 to wipe them off the face of the planet
57:39 and so it goes up there in a black box
57:42 and it gets used it's developed up there
57:45 and very key individuals that are I
57:47 don't know Z clearance people can get up
57:50 there and put that stuff together what
57:53 do we care about US citizens down here
57:56 well there's definitely your your nerds
57:59 that want to know how everything works
58:01 and you could still let them know
58:03 generally how it works from a blackbox
58:06 perspective there is a technology it
58:09 allows
58:09 to accomplish this boom now they would
58:13 abuse kidiot most likely if they don't
58:14 want us to know and so they could keep
58:18 us in the dark but all we really really
58:20 want as a normal citizen is the
58:22 objective to be complete do we have a
58:24 space station as big as a city where
58:28 hundreds of employees work and they're
58:30 safe and they have gravity when they
58:32 want gravity and they have zero gravity
58:33 when they have when they want to do zero
58:35 gravity experiments they have Agra domes
58:38 where they can cook or they can grow
58:40 vegetables and all kinds of stuff they
58:44 breathe oxygen that they manufacture
58:46 using plants be nice right
58:51 and then we report it or they report in
58:54 hey we can get through the Van Allen
58:55 belts finally after 80 years of research
58:59 let's just say we have finally put a
59:02 vehicle all the way through the Van
59:03 Allen belts on the other side it waited
59:05 a day on the other side took other
59:06 sensory input came back all the way
59:09 through the Van Allen belts back down to
59:10 our space station and it looks like all
59:14 the biological matter inside the center
59:16 of the capsule the vehicle the boat is
59:18 fine great that's what we want to know
59:22 can you get that far great now let me
59:26 give you an analogy so that your brain
59:28 can sync up with this if you're not
59:30 already on board there in the movie
59:34 Blade Runner there was a constant
59:36 subplot sort of storyline that most of
59:41 the population of the earth went off
59:44 world and there was the blimp that kept
59:47 flying around advertising about getting
59:49 offworld right and they you know when
59:52 pris met Sebastian in the movie she said
59:55 well you know what's wrong with you
59:58 because he was aging really quickly and
60:00 he named off the condition that he had
60:03 where he had essentially an accelerated
60:05 age process and she called it
60:07 accelerated decrepitude and he said you
60:11 know I you know he had to he had to
60:14 accept his limitations and live with it
60:16 peacefully and so his entire take on it
60:20 was why I like it here I
60:21 I have friends I make my own friends and
60:23 of course he had the Bradbury hotel all
60:25 to himself pretty much in the movie and
60:29 so if you were in the Blade Runner world
60:33 and you were healthy and you wanted to
60:34 go offworld whatever that means it
60:38 seemed like they had gone way beyond our
60:40 solar system because of Roy's final
60:43 dialogue in the movie would you really
60:47 care how you got there I mean would you
60:49 not go to Mars because you didn't
60:50 understand all the technology behind the
60:52 vehicle that take you there I don't
60:55 think so you wouldn't care you just go
60:57 part of it just for the adventure so I
61:00 think that's how society will eventually
61:03 come to understand and trust the
61:05 technology in terms of you know being on
61:09 the moon and being blown away by that I
61:11 think that it would be more our
61:13 generation that will be enamored with
61:16 being on the moon at that something
61:17 we've start out our entire lives and the
61:19 older that you are on the surface of the
61:21 earth and the 21st century the idea of
61:23 being able to stand on the moon in a
61:25 spacesuit safely or be in some space
61:28 station that's protecting you
61:30 but being able to look out a window and
61:32 just look at the vista of the moon and
61:34 look at the Earth from the moon that
61:37 will most appeal to our generation and
61:40 probably not appeal at all to a
61:42 generation in the future imagine you're
61:46 a kid in the 24th century when we figure
61:48 all this out and you're looking at the
61:50 moon and you're like everybody goes to
61:52 the moon it's just this vacation spot
61:54 whatever it's a little scary because
61:56 it's way up there in space but it's also
61:58 massively expensive so only rich kids
62:00 can do it for now and then maybe though
62:02 by the 28th century
62:03 it just becomes some trip to Hawaii
62:07 but honestly think about it you go to
62:10 the formidable cold desolate surface of
62:13 the Moon or you can go to Hawaii and sit
62:16 on a tropical island with ukuleles
62:20 playing rum drinks being served to you
62:22 and you're getting a tan what's going to
62:26 appeal to you more in the 20th century
62:27 something that you can engage at a
62:30 hundred percent or something you can
62:31 engage at ten percent
62:33 what does mankind really need to be
62:36 mankind what we need strategic resources
62:39 which we have on earth
62:42 don't ask Greta of course it's it can be
62:47 really likened to airplanes we fly on
62:52 airplanes all the time I have flown over
62:54 the Atlantic Ocean I have flown over the
62:56 Pacific Ocean and you know it was
63:01 definitely interesting and amazing to do
63:04 it for the very first time but after I
63:07 had flown to London once to fly back two
63:09 more times was kind of like oh god
63:11 another one of these really long flights
63:13 now when you get to the other
63:15 destination that's what's really
63:17 interesting being in England was very
63:19 interesting for me because everyone
63:21 spoke the same language that I spoke but
63:24 everything's a little bit different and
63:25 that was just fascinating to me like I
63:27 said in the past one of the most
63:31 rewarding interesting experiments that
63:34 happened for me was just going to their
63:36 local department store to buy a comb for
63:37 my hair which was short at the time
63:41 which they called rubbers nobody knew
63:44 what I was talking about which one of my
63:45 friends from England was like I don't
63:46 get it man we would talk up we make we
63:48 call him combs I said well this is
63:50 rubber on it so you know I don't know
63:52 what the deal was my chauffeur didn't
63:53 know what it was called and the guy at
63:55 the store didn't know what I was talking
63:56 about no it was like I felt like an
63:59 alien in another world I had to sense I
64:01 had to say well you know it's the thing
64:02 you put through your hair to make it
64:04 straight and it's not a brush oh you
64:07 mean rubber and there was a hole
64:09 obviously aisle full of them
64:11 it was interesting but once that all
64:15 wears off you know once that you once
64:17 you get very familiar with everything
64:20 that's there honey our expectations are
64:22 set they're just human beings on the
64:25 other side and it's wonderful to meet
64:27 them but unless we have occupants of the
64:30 moon you notice that's John layer
64:32 there's a whole space station over there
64:34 made by aliens
64:35 then what's the frontier but what if it
64:40 was like that you can
64:41 what if we get over there we find out
64:44 that what we think are you know just
64:46 like John Lear he points at every single
64:47 bump on the surface of the Moon see
64:49 right there there's Space Station there
64:51 and there's a you know big silos full of
64:55 stuff and he just dreams up all this
64:57 kind of stuff it's funny but what if
64:59 there were you know the aliens that
65:01 participated in creating the earth and
65:03 maintaining it and protecting us they're
65:05 up there gone hey welcome you finally
65:07 passed the first test just like in Star
65:09 Trek you have to hit the speed of light
65:11 to break warp 1 and then the Vulcans
65:14 come and visit you and introduce you to
65:16 the rest of the galaxy
65:17 hey for all we know that's the test get
65:20 to the moon figured out maybe it's on
65:23 Mars you know whatever but I'll close
65:27 with this sort of analogy I've been
65:28 giving this a lot in season five here I
65:31 don't know about you but when I see
65:35 those tribes that are out there
65:37 undiscovered in the rain forests the
65:42 other one north of northeast of
65:45 Australia and then Peru and then
65:49 Argentina and Brazil and you see these
65:53 tribes that just have it all worked out
65:56 you know maybe their cannibal lists
65:57 maybe they're not doesn't really matter
65:59 to them it is normal and you see them
66:02 get introduced to our world and start to
66:06 worry about our problems there's a part
66:08 of me that that feels like they died a
66:11 little bit their world was undone a
66:14 little bit and so part of it is you know
66:21 getting to the moon it depends if
66:24 there's nothing there if it's truly just
66:26 a desolate ball well you know okay so
66:29 you build a big Space Station you drive
66:31 around a lot you find out that there are
66:34 materials on the moon that are
66:35 marginally useful for us on the Earth's
66:38 surface of course for anyone who's
66:40 trying to make it a profit Center
66:42 they're going to exaggerate the
66:45 usefulness of all those materials to
66:47 continue getting money it's just like
66:49 the settlers who came to America
66:50 you know the Americas
66:54 you have gold as the primary resource
67:00 that they were to capture for the king a
67:02 queen of Spain and in doing so they
67:06 really destroyed the habitat of South
67:09 America North America again there's the
67:11 you know nearly completely genocided
67:13 Native Americans you know for all kinds
67:17 of reasons and I think it is interesting
67:20 that man drums up these accomplishments
67:23 as the level of accomplishment that they
67:29 are you know man's first major discovery
67:32 would have been fire the command of fire
67:35 being able to create fire whenever they
67:37 want to and protect it to keep
67:39 themselves warm to generate lights and
67:42 to cook food and then in terms of
67:45 transportation to explore the world
67:47 surface that was the wheel which again
67:51 some civilizations never ever discovered
67:54 the wheel and they lived just fine so we
67:57 build up these arbitrary accomplishments
68:00 as intellectual milestones for mankind
68:04 and the moon is most definitely
68:06 currently one of those accomplishments
68:09 and of course they've deferred to the
68:11 way out of sight out of mind Mars rovers
68:13 which most likely don't exist to you
68:18 know filter a lot of cash out of out of
68:20 our tax dollars science in itself has
68:24 become this ridiculous sort of alarmist
68:28 discipline where you know you've got
68:31 your global warming folks that are
68:34 trying to extort tons of money and
68:35 scientists that will sell out their
68:37 there otherwise contrary science to
68:41 support such a things such they get
68:43 funding so they can have their summer
68:44 house and you know do whatever they got
68:47 to do on the side that's sad NASA and
68:52 I've got an episode called NASA selling
68:54 doom what do they do they constantly try
68:58 to scare the population with these
69:00 meteorites that keep keep skimming by
69:03 the earth and right now we're in a
69:05 pocket in the fall of 2019
69:07 they're they're cyclical articles of
69:10 such a thing are now in full bloom you
69:13 know meteor a 1,200 miles wine comes
69:16 really close to Earth okay well we've
69:22 been alive for a really long time on the
69:24 surface of the planet we've recorded
69:26 history for a very long time whether it
69:28 be symbolically recorded or very
69:31 scientifically recorded and there's no
69:33 history of one of these things hitting
69:35 Earth at all and again you might say oh
69:39 but we have look at the look at the
69:41 crater in Arizona volcano look at the
69:45 the big extinction event thing that's on
69:47 the surface of the earth north of South
69:50 America that is most likely a volcanic
69:54 eruption of mammoth proportions that
69:57 happened a very very long time ago and
70:01 just left the gigantic scar on the
70:04 surface of the earth so it's interesting
70:07 and valuable I think to take a an
70:09 exercise like this and monitor your lust
70:13 for the event and then metabolize it for
70:17 a few decades / centuries after the
70:20 event occurs to see hey what are your
70:23 kids care about anything like I've
70:26 always told you because they lied about
70:27 going to the moon now no child cares
70:30 about going to the moon again the only
70:32 people that see that as an interesting
70:34 revelation or boomers and maybe Gen Xers
70:38 who have awakened to this problem that
70:41 they lied about it and then we're like
70:43 geez you know would it be great to go
70:44 there but then again if you take it
70:46 forward a few centuries alright we get
70:50 there we build a base whoop-dee-doo and
70:52 now what what kid wants to go what adult
70:55 wants to go yeah there's definitely be a
70:58 margin but is it the overwhelming 51% of
71:01 the population of Earth nay it's too
71:04 hostile way too hostile perhaps if one
71:10 could terraform the surface of Venus or
71:12 of Mars and you could generally get a
71:15 tropical world to exist an in-class
71:18 planet
71:19 like earth maybe maybe that's what it's
71:23 all about but that's gonna be centuries
71:26 if not millennia times millennia to
71:30 accomplish such a task so do we want to
71:33 invest in that right now I don't know
71:36 you let me know what you think in the
71:38 comments if you haven't been to deep
71:41 thoughts radio Calm please go it's where
71:43 all the feeds are I'm gonna make a quick

71:49 the page as well as the season 1
71:51 episodes which are now been moved to a
71:53 different channel you may actually find
71:56 embedded season 1 episodes on other
71:59 people's websites those still work I
72:00 didn't block them I just unlisted them
72:02 but if you want to see the remastered
72:04 ones either go to [ __ ] shoot or the
72:05 other channel on YouTube and you'll find
72:07 them there anyway until the next episode
