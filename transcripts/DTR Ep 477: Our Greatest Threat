00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts today we're gonna do a
00:35 listener request from [ __ ] shoot its
00:38 names Clayton Bigsby I'm also gonna mix
00:42 in another idea I had for an episode
00:44 which I don't think is a full episode so
00:47 the two cop two topics we're gonna go
00:49 for here one's gonna be new which is the
00:54 one that I've planned but don't think it
00:57 can go the whole distance without
00:58 repeating myself quite a bit beyond the
01:00 point where you get it you know it's one
01:02 of the worst things about videos is that
01:04 someone will explain something very well
01:06 and then they just keep going and going
01:07 and going and I know I do it
01:09 due to the format link so that's why I
01:11 did aggressed so much into other
01:13 subjects but the user request was or
01:17 listener request was so used to software
01:20 I apologize what do I consider to be the
01:24 greatest threat to us today as humanity
01:27 so that's one subject and the other
01:30 subject is I guess for the sake of a
01:33 better for the best title I can come up
01:36 with is I have no idea what the hell to
01:38 call this thing because of the two
01:40 mixing together but one of the factors
01:43 that sort of buttons up the first
01:46 request is something I refer to as like
01:49 hero pacification and that is the theory
01:53 that if you look at Hollywood because
01:57 it's sort of a cross-section of humanity
01:59 right what are do we accept as imitating
02:05 life etc is that we are fed a bunch of
02:10 fictional heroes which is has occurred
02:13 over the whole span of history but today
02:16 it's become sort of an epidemic of
02:19 psychological medicine because we hate
02:22 our lives you know too many people out
02:24 there they hate their lives and so they
02:26 can go to a movie and watch a heroes
02:27 succeed and fight evil and all this
02:30 other stuff and then come back to the
02:33 crappy life's and then the next thing
02:35 they can do is wait for the next movie
02:36 and then you go back out that's why they
02:37 can make horrible
02:38 movies or as long as a hero wins in the
02:41 end a lot of people will give it like a
02:44 decent review but it's a crappy movie
02:47 some movies are tragedies and the kids
02:49 don't even realize it right
02:52 Tron Legacy is the tragedy right a
02:56 tragedy is a hero that never overcomes
02:58 their obstacle well Sam the fictional
03:03 character in Legacy was supposed to go
03:05 and get his father out of the system he
03:07 didn't he failed he brought his chick
03:10 out which causes even more problems
03:11 especially for the writers of Tron 3 but
03:14 it's a very interesting question to have
03:16 someone just simply ask it so clearly
03:20 you talk about a bunch of stuff okay
03:23 what's the biggest threat what like what
03:25 should we be concerned about in your
03:27 opinion now obviously you have to always
03:29 take into account this is one dudes
03:31 opinion you should never take one
03:33 person's opinion as your complete
03:36 opinion of the subject to yourself you
03:38 should add your own DNA
03:39 you should scrutinize whether or not you
03:41 think certain things are a problem for
03:43 you
03:43 even though there might be a problem for
03:45 everyone else in the world maybe it's
03:46 not a problem for you so you don't need
03:48 to panic or anything last thing I want
03:50 to do is create any mindset of hysteria
03:55 or panic or essentially ill feeling when
04:01 you wake up in the morning if I ever
04:03 tell you anything that alarmed you I
04:06 want you to feel better the next day
04:09 because you're like well at least I know
04:10 the truth you know this was the big
04:12 thing when we all started waking up
04:13 about 2005 you know you get many of you
04:18 had this question or someone says well
04:20 how do you sleep at night
04:21 how do you sleep at night knowing all
04:22 this stuff and what they're really doing
04:24 is sometimes they're being genuine to
04:26 you they believe you they respect your
04:28 research what have you other times it's
04:30 sort of a patronizing statement kind of
04:33 built into that you know well you know I
04:36 know this is true of course and I'm
04:37 smarter than you which is why my life is
04:39 bliss and which it's not and I just want
04:43 to know how you can sleep at night let
04:44 me use this technique of getting you to
04:46 relax off of all the conspiracy research
04:48 because I'm gonna make it apparent to
04:50 you you're injuring yourself
04:51 by learning the truth okay you do lose
04:55 sleep when you first wake up boy do you
04:57 ever lose sleep depending on what
04:58 subject matter wakes you up most of us
05:01 woke up with that day in September we
05:04 didn't wake up that day but we woke up
05:07 as a result of loose change and movies
05:11 like zeitgeist and just other research
05:14 you know as much as I don't ever watch
05:17 Alex Jones anymore because he's off all
05:19 social media and he's been really
05:22 strange for last three or four years he
05:26 did he is responsible for bringing us a
05:28 ton of information he's the first guy
05:31 that videotaped Bohemian Grove just
05:33 knowing that that if action exists
05:35 allowed a lot of us to go off into
05:37 research way outside of his research and
05:40 then we realize it's a real thing hmm I
05:45 sleep better knowing that I understand
05:48 where I am better right none of us
05:53 really know what this whole place is but
05:55 none of us know for intentionally
05:56 created or if we're just the most
05:58 beautiful mistake the universe's ever
06:00 made but the universe exists someone
06:03 made that it exists somehow but how do
06:06 you answer that question you know I
06:07 thought about it was like wow that's a
06:09 great appealing subject matter and so
06:14 the question is how do you address that
06:17 and I think that my brain automatically
06:19 goes to the two most logical ways of
06:22 sorting out our greatest threats and to
06:26 sort of the here and now literally right
06:29 now then maybe short term and long term
06:33 what's interesting about the question is
06:36 is that if anyone had asked me that
06:37 question let's say I was the same age
06:39 but it's 1985 I don't know I don't even
06:43 know where I would go
06:44 don't listen to too much heavy metal I
06:47 don't know you know but today there's a
06:50 war going on for the complete ideology
06:55 of how humans are supposed to exist on
06:57 this planet and beautifully because of a
07:00 lot of movements even this qa9 thing you
07:04 know even though
07:05 you know even on its pretty no he's made
07:11 so many predictions about people being
07:13 arrested that you know well if anyone's
07:16 arrested the next week he claims that
07:17 that's the big boom and it's like really
07:19 you know it's thought it was a bad bone
07:21 but it's like we're looking for you his
07:23 definition of the biblical boom and then
07:28 the dude Jo M who seems to be in cahoots
07:29 with him it makes all of his videos who
07:32 sounds like JFK jr. he's up there just
07:35 shoveling [ __ ] into everyone's head I
07:37 mean I do not support thick I mean I
07:39 like every once in a while one of his
07:40 tweets here and there where he goes
07:41 generic and I feel like what he's saying
07:43 applies to all of us but a lot of times
07:45 he's trying to promote [ __ ]
07:47 time-travel and also their horse [ __ ]
07:50 and so you got to be careful you got to
07:52 be careful who you get your information
07:53 from right that's why I'm you know
07:57 routinely cynical about even things that
07:59 are popular in the awakening side
08:01 because it's like guys we could all get
08:03 had there be had by these folks you know
08:06 now for the longtime listeners this will
08:10 be a lot of repeat but maybe it's a nice
08:14 episode for us to all kind of review
08:17 everything that I've said and everything
08:19 you've commented on because a lot of it
08:20 is based on your comments that's where I
08:24 get some some peer occult data about
08:27 things especially from Facebook folks
08:29 that are a little bit more verbose and
08:31 they come and they come and they post
08:33 all the time you know the I think the
08:37 number one thing that we can all kind of
08:39 agree on is our health if we're not
08:42 alive then what can happen yeah even if
08:48 reincarnation exists but you know if I
08:53 were to go a little existential right
08:54 from the very beginning I would say
08:56 let's say that we do reincarnate and
08:58 let's say that there are multiple life
09:01 mmm entities that we could inhabit
09:04 outside of this planet then that would
09:08 make earth its own experiment its own
09:11 captive audience of folks and so what we
09:16 would be doing is continually coming
09:17 back fighting
09:19 this perpetual evil there's always
09:22 existed on planet earth you know it's
09:24 get good it gets good for a little while
09:25 in one particular region and a bunch of
09:27 [ __ ] or numskulls come down and beat
09:30 up on utopian societies and destroy them
09:33 and then we all go back to the [ __ ]
09:34 stone Age's and then we all kind of
09:37 realize oh let's try to rediscover what
09:38 we our ancestors destroyed you know
09:40 that's happened to quite a few times in
09:42 history and so on a perpetual sort of
09:47 conveyor belt of life I don't know I
09:53 don't know I think maybe I think a lot
09:55 of us talk about you know the potential
09:58 of car Matic loops of trying to be a
10:01 better person each time you come back so
10:03 that you leave a little your soul leaves
10:05 a little bit more pure but the problem
10:08 with that theory in my mind which I just
10:10 negated in an episode that either just
10:12 aired or it's coming is that you don't
10:17 choose your parents necessarily before
10:19 you get born and even if you do then why
10:21 would you choose a an alcoholic parent
10:23 that beats you right it might turn you
10:25 into an animal killer and then a person
10:28 killer right so blaming you for
10:31 everything that's going on is sort of
10:35 and sort of maybe not fair recently I've
10:39 been binge watching these documentaries
10:43 the main company is Deutsch I want to
10:48 say it right Vella
10:49 wel le you'll see DW and one of the
10:52 corners of the episodes on YouTube and
10:56 you know they have a little global
10:57 warming here and there but it Manas
10:59 about 1% it's not too bad but I watched
11:04 one yesterday yesterday night it was
11:08 about equality which is a word that
11:12 we're all sick and tired of hearing
11:14 because the Equality that is is in the
11:18 forefront of like the Democratic Party
11:20 is largely faux it's fake
11:24 right there's a gentleman he's still
11:27 alive his name's dr. Saul well and he's
11:31 an African American
11:32 gentleman or a black guy some of us say
11:34 he's a genius in the late 70s early 80s
11:38 he did I believe his doctor's thesis on
11:41 equality as it turns out between men and
11:44 women and everyone likes to be a victim
11:47 because you get [ __ ] for free right
11:49 you get free [ __ ] pay raises whether
11:51 or not you have the quality of the
11:52 qualifications or not now I have friends
11:55 that are female
11:57 they're absolutely oppressed from the
12:02 salaries that they deserve I watch them
12:05 look for jobs and there'll be ten years
12:08 deeper and experience and they'll lose
12:11 out to a male that is ten years younger
12:13 but obviously just you know they're
12:16 fresh out of college they'll be 25 years
12:18 old whether they might have three years
12:19 of college and my friends are you know
12:22 they have say 13 years of experience or
12:26 more and they can't get the same job for
12:29 the same pay so I'm aware that this
12:31 occurs and those are [ __ ] who run
12:33 companies that need to have their balls
12:35 [ __ ] cut off right it's [ __ ] now
12:38 some people aren't as good as they think
12:40 they are and then they get in that
12:41 situation but sometimes you know people
12:44 have great pedigrees and they're being
12:46 overlooked but saw will proved a couple
12:53 things with real statistics ok real
12:56 people he talked to real people building
12:59 his opinions and the early eighties he
13:02 went on TV quite a bit you can find all
13:03 those interviews it's it's really
13:05 enlightening and he said you've heard me
13:07 say this a couple times because I'm
13:09 gonna draw a big difference between the
13:11 Equality I watched last night and the
13:16 quality that is the one I'm talking
13:17 about right now which is equal pay he
13:21 figured out that if a woman never had
13:23 children and never got married and
13:25 simply went into school like a normal
13:28 male which was very unique in the late
13:30 70s early 80s they earned 20% more than
13:34 a male as long as the establishment
13:37 itself is incorrupt right so that's good
13:43 you had the soccer team the female
13:45 soccer team lady
13:46 I was at the Olympic team or something a
13:50 woman came out and said that women
13:51 weren't getting paid as much and we
13:53 means continuously find out they're
13:54 getting paid millions of dollars more
13:56 than the male team so these liars and
14:01 these fake victims mess it up for
14:04 everyone who's got really quality issues
14:08 but I want to start off with this
14:10 interesting interesting thing I saw this
14:12 documentary was it's fairly popular in
14:15 the thumbnail recommendations on YouTube
14:17 so you're probably whenever problem
14:18 finding it they covered a guy in New
14:22 York who very intelligent guy I mean
14:28 every time this guy spoke it was just
14:30 like you put your chin on your hand
14:32 listen to him speak the wisdom coming
14:34 out his guy was great be it he had a
14:36 normal life and a normal job but then
14:38 lost it I don't know how old the guy was
14:40 see what he's about mid 40s or whatever
14:43 but he recycles now as a way of you know
14:47 creating a living he makes about 70
14:49 bucks a day 70 75 dollars a day on
14:53 average and then he covered a another
14:57 gentleman in Kenya who picks the trash
15:00 in Kenya we're talking gruelling [ __ ]
15:03 man the guy in Kenya was on a junk pile
15:05 like a real junk just food and all kinds
15:09 of stuff and he's all these people in
15:11 Kenya they're picking through trash the
15:13 first thing that they do when they get
15:14 to work the male's pick through the
15:16 trash to find food especially meat it
15:20 has been recently thrown away I mean it
15:22 was disgusting you know Flies and stuff
15:26 and then just brush it off and poof eat
15:28 it and you see all these guys eating it
15:29 first and then they go do their thing
15:31 and that guy was making about $30 a week
15:36 but the big sort of crescendo of this
15:40 episode was that it seems as if because
15:45 any other thing to is the precursor to
15:47 me watching this particular documentary
15:49 was probably about ten documentaries
15:51 before that talking about how third
15:53 world countries are being exploited by
15:56 corporations in Europe and America
15:59 and China that in some in India guess to
16:03 but they're all serving usually the
16:05 Masters of the first world countries are
16:06 consuming ridiculous amounts of crap
16:08 right but they're they're taking all the
16:12 things that they know are illegal and
16:14 first of all countries because they kill
16:16 people they poison people and they're
16:17 pushing them off and from Indonesia to
16:19 all the countries in Africa Uganda Ghana
16:24 Kenya China I don't think I've seen one
16:31 in South America yet but then it came to
16:34 this this other episode the episode said
16:37 when there's a huge discrepancy between
16:39 the wealthy and the poor what that does
16:44 is that loses societial societal
16:47 cohesion right easy for me to say such
16:51 that the rich don't give a [ __ ] about
16:52 the planet and the poor can't give a
16:54 [ __ ] about the planet because the poor
16:57 are so broke they can't eat and they and
17:01 if they want to have one or two kids
17:03 it's already insurmountable a guy in
17:04 Kenya only have one little daughter the
17:08 guy in New York had I don't believe any
17:09 family at all besides his family had
17:12 passed already I think his mother had
17:15 passed he talked about his mother sort
17:16 of in the third-person realm and just
17:22 prior to that documentary okay I watched
17:24 another one that without the Indian sand
17:26 mafia now I didn't know this was going
17:30 on but India's president and I don't
17:33 know exactly when this documentary was
17:34 made it couldn't it may not be the
17:37 president it's the president right now
17:38 the Trump just visited but they said
17:40 that they want to build a Chicago type
17:43 city which is not just for those of you
17:44 haven't been there it's not a gigantic
17:47 physical footprint on the ground but is
17:48 you know it's a very bustling town and
17:51 forever it had the tallest building in
17:53 America which was the year against the
17:55 world right the Chicago series building
17:57 what they want to build that level of
17:59 building was like 30 between now and
18:04 2030 like the next ten years would build
18:07 like one and a half or so all Jesus that
18:09 would be you know three a year yes right
18:12 being
18:13 ridiculous and in order to build like
18:16 that you have to have a lot of concrete
18:18 and concrete requires sand so in India
18:21 they have a problem where they have
18:24 outlawed independents and people like
18:29 you and I going out and digging up sand
18:31 and selling it to somebody you have to
18:33 do it in certain areas of course there's
18:34 owning things and when you take a lot of
18:36 sand out of an area you change the
18:39 landscape so rivers that used to flow in
18:41 one way all sudden just flow all over
18:43 the place and they'll flood crops and
18:45 I'm talking flooding entire regions you
18:48 know thousands of acres and killing a
18:50 bunch of food which is necessary because
18:52 India has got over a billion people in
18:57 Huntington Beach here we have to manage
19:00 our sand very carefully because we have
19:03 to pump a bunch of water against the
19:05 ocean because the industry will
19:07 eventually capture the beach I think we
19:10 pump three million gallons of water back
19:13 to the ocean every day so it's a big
19:16 deal but because these people are so
19:21 broke because there's this huge
19:22 difference in India between the rich and
19:24 the poor and the poor you know it's a
19:27 huge majority of the country when they
19:31 caught these guys just out in the field
19:34 digging up saying and putting in the
19:35 back of these trucks they found our
19:37 street with 30 dump trucks I mean a
19:40 certain say dumper their big-ass trucks
19:43 okay
19:45 waiting to pick up their sand and it was
19:47 all illegal and they went to the police
19:49 and the police said oh there's nothing
19:50 there nothing that's happening and they
19:51 go we just recorded it oh well maybe
19:53 there is a couple you know they're all
19:55 paid off
19:56 right so even the politicians are taking
19:58 money to look the other way because I'm
20:01 sure from the politicians down from the
20:03 Presidents on yeah get it done Harry
20:04 King who cares if some farmer loses this
20:07 that's just the attrition because we've
20:10 made this outrageous goal to build all
20:11 these big cities right you know
20:14 meanwhile in India you'll have a a city
20:18 with ten million people with less than a
20:20 hundred bathrooms in the whole city
20:21 people are defecating and pissing
20:24 everywhere and you know which
20:26 gets the place nice and polluted ecoli
20:30 you know type infections and that kind
20:32 of stuff so it's bad it's not sort of a
20:36 macro view of something I hadn't really
20:38 realized but once I had it explained to
20:39 me in this video I was like yeah that
20:42 makes sense
20:43 you know and so you will have that's why
20:45 you can't have in my opinion folks
20:47 coming in and just trying to address
20:50 just the poverty side of things or just
20:52 trying to steal the money from the rich
20:54 and give it to the poor because the next
20:57 thing that happens is you get sort of a
20:59 middle class that is sort of like the
21:02 third act of wall-e where one's you know
21:04 floating in chairs they have barely any
21:05 bone density and everyone's a loser the
21:09 reason why I mentioned at the beginning
21:11 is it they talk to a teacher at one
21:16 point that was trying to I can't
21:18 remember exactly which one it was
21:19 because I watch one about tobacco one
21:21 about gold and they're always trying to
21:24 teach these people like look you're
21:25 endangering yourself with all the toxins
21:28 you're using and the stuff you're
21:29 touching and your kids are you know
21:32 gonna be mentally impaired by the time
21:36 you get done taking them to gold mines
21:38 and things using mercury and boiling off
21:40 mercury right into the nose of your
21:41 child which is a neural toxin right
21:45 destroys your brain
21:48 but this teacher looks at the camera and
21:51 he's obviously a very educated person
21:53 and this was one of the one of the
21:55 African ones I saw and he just said
21:57 really intelligently he just said look
21:59 man I've been trying to help these
22:00 people my whole life and he goes maybe
22:03 you should help them because nothing
22:05 works they won't listen to me
22:08 the poverty is so insane there's nothing
22:10 I can say to them to convince them to
22:11 let their kids go to school one of them
22:15 was in India they have kids working in
22:18 coal mines the conditions of these coal
22:23 mines are beyond anything you could
22:26 [ __ ] imagine unless you have a coal
22:28 mining family but even if you had a coal
22:30 mining family and you do formal coal
22:33 mining and say America you would be
22:35 shocked to see what these little kids
22:37 have to do and they crawl in these
22:39 little holes
22:40 they're maybe three feet tall like these
22:41 slits with these you know big pancake
22:44 rocks over their heads that if they
22:46 fathered just squash straight but they
22:48 have to crawl like you know 500 feet
22:53 down into these well maybe it was even
22:56 meters I don't know they kept going back
22:58 and forth between standard metric or
23:00 imperial metric they said that the
23:03 temperature for some of these areas
23:04 especially where they're digging courts
23:06 in Africa they just go down these holes
23:09 that they're deep but it's like 50
23:12 degrees Celsius down there like what I
23:15 know 40s low 40s like unbearably hot see
23:21 kids pass out they lose their energy and
23:23 then they can just die it's crazy right
23:27 so keep that in the back your mind of
23:29 what is the greatest threat there are
23:32 greatest threats that are much bigger
23:34 than we are and then there's the ones
23:36 that we have to do to keep ourselves
23:38 healthy rate as I say on so many
23:41 episodes let's go back to the noun your
23:46 health detoxification of your body is in
23:50 America it is in a pure sense it would
23:54 be damn near impossible to pull off you
23:57 would never leave your house for food
23:58 other than to get raw products from a
24:01 vendor that is buying you know non GMOs
24:04 and you have to kind of check that out
24:05 as well trying to get meats that don't
24:07 have a bunch of steroids and the more
24:10 antibiotics in them in their places like
24:12 in my town I would go to mothers to get
24:15 all my vegetables and eggs and milk and
24:17 whatever cereals any the products use my
24:21 bathroom there also all real clean I
24:24 mean mothers you can just close your
24:24 eyes and pick it up and it's good and
24:26 then Trader Joe's which is a big chain
24:28 here in America carries really great
24:32 beef whatever you want chicken turkey
24:35 beef and it's all range fed there's no
24:37 hormones in it so mixing those two
24:40 together you could get your supplies to
24:42 eat now water is really rough there's
24:46 this lava water we're getting from
24:48 Iceland that actually says on the bottle
24:49 no fluoride but you can also just drink
24:52 distilled water
24:53 which they say is so bad for you because
24:55 it does give you minerals and it's just
24:57 kind of like you just kinda like I'm you
24:58 go you know stop already
25:01 great everything's good for you is
25:04 negative and everything negatives for
25:05 you is good for you rate detoxification
25:08 is a very intense process right part of
25:12 it has to do with things that you're not
25:14 getting that you need to get like
25:16 sunlight on your face for half an hour
25:19 to an hour a day you really need about
25:20 an hour a day and that's a hard regimen
25:23 you gotta eat lunch outside in the
25:25 winter time Helmand it's it's barely
25:28 bright enough outside you catch anything
25:30 plus it's overcast and stuff even
25:32 overcast it's still the same light the
25:34 light that you need on your face such
25:36 that your pituitary gland creates
25:38 vitamin D is necessary and I've
25:40 mentioned several times that in Alaska
25:42 and Russia they actually take their kids
25:45 and put them in front of tanning
25:46 machines for I don't know how long but
25:49 they get them exposed to the equivalency
25:51 of the frequency of the Sun to make sure
25:54 they have vitamin D cos taking vitamin D
25:56 is a joke if you're doing it you know
25:59 there's all kinds of theories about
26:02 taking it with other things to make it
26:03 absorb better nothing replaces that fate
26:09 of the photonic wave hitting your skull
26:11 and bouncing off that organ thus
26:13 stimulating the creation of vitamin D
26:15 nothing sunscreen well most of it turns
26:19 carcinogenic as soon as it hits the Sun
26:22 but I'll just tell you what I've done in
26:24 my own life once again it's been quite a
26:27 few episodes since I covered this then
26:29 one I always forget to tell you which
26:31 I'm gonna lead off with so I don't
26:32 forget it is your underarm deodorant
26:35 antiperspirant SAR full of aluminum in
26:38 most cases now there's a lot of options
26:40 since I started the show that people
26:41 make non-toxic antiperspirants
26:46 essentially what it is is you have a
26:48 bunch of glands in your armpits that are
26:50 did their to sweats it's there to remove
26:52 toxins from your body so no matter what
26:54 you're putting in those glands whether
26:56 it be the aluminum which is hard for
26:58 your body or other natural crystals or
27:02 what-have-you
27:03 you probably shouldn't
27:06 but some people do struggle with body
27:07 odor more than others so I understand I
27:10 have been off of antiperspirants for so
27:12 long I don't remember when I made the
27:14 change but I just switched to deodorant
27:16 now I'm very lucky I don't perspire much
27:19 and if I do it's never usually in my
27:21 armpits I went two days or something or
27:24 if I get on the patio I do a full
27:25 workout session and it's been a day
27:28 since I showered yeah I can smell myself
27:29 but it's mainly from other parts of my
27:32 body so that's the first one and you
27:37 know I can't claim that there has been
27:39 any noticeable effect I don't know I
27:41 don't know now fluoride toothpaste
27:45 you know fluoride is super bad for you
27:47 it rots your teeth and dentists love it
27:50 did this recommend it because it crushes
27:52 your teeth it blows up your enamel it
27:54 gives women osteoporosis it settles in
27:59 the pineal gland and your in your brain
28:01 crystallizes thus making your flesh move
28:04 out of the way same as your enamel and
28:05 your teeth moves out of the way of these
28:07 these aluminum particles that's what it
28:09 actually is industrial fluoride is
28:12 actually called fluorine before it's put
28:14 in your toothpaste and if you read the
28:17 site of a fluoridated toothpaste tube
28:19 and it talks about how you're supposed
28:21 to go the poison center if you swallow
28:22 more than a pea-sized amount of it well
28:25 come on brush your teeth ten times
28:26 you're definitely swallowing a pea-sized
28:28 amount of it it's toxic to the human
28:30 body the Army Corps of Engineers again
28:34 buried a bunch of barrels underneath the
28:35 Golden Gate Bridge in the late 40s of
28:39 fluorine which was a result of making
28:41 all this aluminum based products for
28:43 World War two theory was that the
28:46 barrels were gonna age break and the
28:48 diffuse into the ocean there you go I
28:50 think I've had a significant brain
28:53 augmentation since I got off the
28:55 fluoride but the other one that I was
28:59 drinking so much of I really can't
29:03 believe it there was just a small point
29:07 in time where I got on this and then I
29:08 got off of it but I was never a big fan
29:11 of diet sodas ever because I thought
29:12 Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi taste like [ __ ]
29:15 couldn't do that but diet dr. pepper was
29:18 pretty decent
29:19 and so the day I found out this
29:21 information like I said I had a 12 pack
29:24 unopened of Dr Pepper in my fridge and I
29:29 let it sit there for months until I just
29:31 opened all the cans and poured them down
29:32 the drain
29:34 but aspartame is horrible for your body
29:38 it turns into a formaldehyde derivative
29:42 in your body it also has unbound methyl
29:45 ester which is rubbing alcohol it is
29:48 known to give certain people grand mal
29:50 seizures randomly and the thing is is
29:54 that you know I think I think Donald
29:57 Trump said you know why is it that folks
29:59 that drink diet coke are usually obese
30:01 it's because you have a huge problem
30:03 with sugar intake and calorie intake and
30:06 his diet cokes a joke right diet coke
30:10 sponsoring a woman's cancer run is the
30:13 best biggest ironic joke for the cancer
30:18 industry right this stuff was pushed to
30:23 the FDA through one of the most corrupt
30:25 moments in history it's where the FDA
30:27 actually became completely corrupt and
30:30 Donald Rumsfeld ran the company Cyril
30:32 they gets SC AR L aspartame was a heart
30:37 medication that was known to be about 25
30:40 times sweeter than sugar but it killed
30:42 everything all the rats all the monkeys
30:44 and so they bought off everyone in the
30:47 FDA they could and they had Reagan fire
30:49 everyone unknowingly and appoint a bunch
30:52 of farmers shills to get it through and
30:55 then cancer rates went up at the 88 % in
30:57 the next 10 years it's bad news man the
31:02 other one I got rid of and said the
31:04 story several times is that the
31:06 microwave I had one of the coolest
31:09 looking microwaves on planet Earth with
31:12 like a widescreen television was so cool
31:14 was very proud of my purchase I didn't
31:17 cook much in it but you know you boil
31:20 water or whatever but what it's doing is
31:23 it's shattering food compounds that
31:25 nature put together into food elements
31:27 some of those are okay and some of those
31:29 are hard for your body methyl ester
31:32 which is
31:33 found inside of aspartame is bound to
31:36 pectin on the skin of an apple now maybe
31:40 you think well I don't microwave an
31:41 apple what the hell's issue this is just
31:43 an example but let's say you had some
31:45 pie some apple pie and there's remnants
31:49 of the the fiber from the skin on the
31:53 apple itself and then you microwave
31:55 because you want to put some ice cream
31:57 on top or whatever well when you
31:59 oscillate a water molecule up and down 1
32:01 billion times in one second you rip
32:05 apart the methyl ester from the pectin
32:07 and when it's bound it's fine goes right
32:10 to your system it's fiber it's good just
32:12 to eat an apple you're fine but when you
32:14 microwave it you pull those apart and
32:17 then you have unbound methyl ester which
32:19 is the toxin to the human body
32:21 hmm so I got rid of it plus drinking
32:25 water that is rotating still in the
32:28 glass in your coffee and whatever the
32:30 hell you think you need to eat up just
32:31 get a gas oven and it's about the same
32:33 amount of time like 50% longer so it's
32:36 50% fast you know 50% more of fast or
32:40 you but you're an electrical system
32:44 right your whole nervous system is
32:46 electrical last thing you want to do is
32:49 put something in your body that's going
32:50 to disturb the actual normal flow of
32:53 electrons to your nervous system Russia
32:57 ban microwaves when they first came out
32:59 not to keep their citizens from enjoying
33:02 microwaves but because they did the due
33:03 diligence on the technology and what it
33:05 does to food and said were or a
33:07 socialistic communistic country with
33:10 universal health care we don't want
33:11 everyone coming down with problems
33:12 because of this machine so they banned
33:15 it now I shouldn't have to tell you that
33:18 Jim met genetically modified food is
33:20 very dangerous for you number one thing
33:23 it does is sterilize you some people are
33:26 very susceptible to it you can make a
33:28 woman allergic to a man's sperm
33:29 fertility clinics exploded the exact
33:32 same time the GMO was introduced into
33:35 American society the second thing it
33:38 does is it electrically rots your upper
33:41 intestine you have tentacles that hang
33:43 and go up and your intestine to grab all
33:46 the nutrients
33:47 because that's what that's where the
33:48 that event occurs and your upper
33:50 intestine will it electrically shocks
33:52 and literally stuns and burns away these
33:56 these little follicles that grab that
33:58 stuff and it takes two weeks to grow
34:00 them back so if you eat more GMO they
34:03 never go back and so you become
34:04 extremely unhealthy well I don't have to
34:07 tell you what happens to your body if
34:08 you don't eat what you are made out of
34:11 right because you can't ingest it
34:13 because you're damaging your gut
34:15 probiotics have blown up in the 21st
34:17 century as sort of this repair mechanism
34:22 stop eating it as much as you possibly
34:24 can
34:26 processed foods processed foods are bad
34:30 men you know we're a lot of us are
34:35 learning about the wet markets in Wuhan
34:37 where they have live animals until you
34:39 buy them and they slaughter them right
34:41 there on the spot you take a moment you
34:42 eat it well technically speaking there's
34:45 no reason why China can't have wet
34:47 markets but the problem is is that that
34:50 society is still evolving and so they
34:54 don't have hygiene where it needs to be
34:57 and so they they have horrible markets
35:01 with all this blood everywhere and they
35:03 store the animals horribly and you
35:04 couldn't you can cringe that they eat
35:06 every single animal on planet earth
35:08 including all dogs and cats but that's
35:11 just a cultural difference if they kept
35:13 these place is clean and followed some
35:15 refrigeration and it hose down the blood
35:18 as soon as it's created and all this
35:20 other stuff and check the animals for
35:22 disease before they you know you could
35:24 have that because eating fresh meat is
35:27 obviously the way man has been on this
35:30 planet for more years than the most
35:32 recent you know a few hundred years
35:35 where we've been able to refrigerate
35:36 things and the reason why is that when
35:42 something is dead it on eyes --is
35:43 meaning it's it's a negative electron
35:47 clouds around all the atoms in the food
35:49 become the predominant material as it
35:52 decays decomposes it slows down when it
35:56 slows down it's called death right so
35:59 you can store a
36:00 piece of meat in a refrigerator for a
36:02 long time in their thought out and it
36:04 tastes normal it doesn't taste foul but
36:07 as long as it's been dead for a really
36:09 long time you'll be able to slow down a
36:11 little bit of that decay you'll be able
36:12 to slow down a little bit of that
36:13 ionization but if you can get it fresh
36:17 always get it fresh you know when you
36:19 eat lobster you have to eat it fresh
36:21 because lobster decays so quickly it
36:24 becomes a toxin most fish is that way
36:26 right people don't save fish people try
36:28 to take calamari home from a restaurant
36:30 in there if it's a good restaurant the
36:32 waiters will go no no you can't take oh
36:34 no you have to eat it right here or
36:36 that's it you don't take squid home and
36:38 try to eat it later right it's kind of
36:40 gross anyway later on needs to be warm
36:42 okay so those are some physical
36:45 properties that we need to be aware of
36:48 to rid ourselves of cancers okay well
36:53 then you have your overall stress
36:55 pattern some people are wired very tight
37:00 and they do get stressed for the
37:02 littlest thing in life and I'm not
37:06 exactly sure what causes that because
37:09 well actually sorry I will say there is
37:12 just there is a theory that I came up
37:14 with when I dated a girl who was 5 foot
37:16 tall she was a bodybuilder in a really
37:20 beautiful way and she liked to you know
37:24 she worked really really hard in the gym
37:26 burning you know hundreds and hundreds
37:28 of calories in the gym looked unreal
37:30 head to toe however she would come home
37:35 and eat a bunch of like GD food because
37:38 she earned it and she was never gonna
37:40 gain a pound cuz she'd go back into the
37:41 gym but when she would eat all this
37:43 sugar
37:45 she was prone to panic attacks
37:47 especially when she went to bed now the
37:50 other thing that will lead into that is
37:52 that you're you're a caregiver you're a
37:54 mother you're a father but for her she
37:57 was so tiny and she was eating so much
37:59 sugar which you're not supposed to eat
38:01 you know as a human being you never
38:03 supposed to eat pure sugars she had like
38:05 you know potentially 2,000 calories in
38:08 her five hundred to a thousand calories
38:09 and now she lays her head down and now
38:11 the the chaotic day's event
38:14 sakr what could happen you know we
38:17 talked about getting out of control with
38:18 your mind in other episodes where you
38:20 worry too much because you manifest up
38:22 things you eat too many black apples of
38:24 what could happen right and I would wake
38:29 up and she'd be you know she wake up she
38:33 slept like a you know just beautiful
38:34 like an angel but boy she wake up
38:36 sometimes and she's like having a panic
38:38 attack and I put my hand on her chest
38:40 and her little heart was just pounding
38:43 and so I would use this voice of mine
38:47 and just softly talk to her and ask her
38:50 what she's thinking about and we go
38:52 through all the black apples and I'd
38:54 tell her you know hey it's gonna be okay
38:56 it's alright well you know you're just
38:58 worried about that because this Annette
38:59 but you know things are okay what could
39:01 happen what's the worst thing to happen
39:02 Aaron so it's okay if I get her heart
39:04 rate right back down and we go back to
39:06 bed she ended up having a few of these
39:10 in a row actually the day that she broke
39:12 up with me was the result of like three
39:15 or four days of these and she wasn't
39:17 telling me what she was thinking she was
39:18 kind of hiding these panic attacks and
39:20 then like six months later she called me
39:21 up she goes I think we should be back
39:24 together because I cannot remember why
39:25 on earth I broke up with you in the
39:27 first place on the way down you did your
39:29 family really unfortunate it's a really
39:31 good connection there but the other one
39:36 is in the now in terms of detoxification
39:40 is the most frustrating of them all
39:42 which I've talked about different
39:43 episodes which is you're being exposed
39:47 to things that you don't have any say
39:49 over try to drink the tap water out of
39:52 your house well in America is about a
39:53 95% chance your tap water's got fluoride
39:56 in it go buy an ice tea somewhere or
39:59 some soda anything drink just get water
40:01 at the restaurant you drink in Floyd
40:03 that's why it becomes exceptionally
40:05 difficult you bring your water with you
40:08 every day as well as you could right
40:10 paradigm shift we have more
40:13 electromagnetic waves on our body than
40:17 ever before when I did my 5g episode I
40:21 think in season 3 I cover all the
40:23 frequencies but we're talking about you
40:25 know the average frequency of the earth
40:28 incas is something around 20 Hertz but
40:32 the amount of stuff you get off a 4G
40:34 tower let alone a 5g tower let alone
40:36 from a radio broadcast of any kind for
40:40 television or radio we're talking about
40:43 billions of Hertz write 5g is billions
40:47 potentially a hundred billion Hertz well
40:52 I can guarantee you I'm gonna make a
40:54 little prediction here and you could
40:56 archive this video and pull it out in
40:58 100 years would be like that guy was
40:59 Nostradamus man here we go
41:01 we all look back at the 20th century in
41:04 America where cigarettes were
41:08 recommended by doctors doctors would
41:12 smoke in surgical rooms they'd smoke in
41:15 your recovery room you know parents
41:18 smoked around their kids cigarettes are
41:20 completely different objects than cigars
41:22 for those of you don't know a cigarette
41:25 barely has any tobacco in it the stuff
41:27 you're seeing that's brown inside the
41:28 stick at least in America is paper it's
41:32 a cardboard derivative and the brown is
41:34 just a color that they put on the paper
41:36 to make you think it's tobacco but the
41:38 stuff that makes you high by smoking the
41:40 cigarette is this sludge which is a
41:42 tobacco derivative but just like they
41:44 mix crack cocaine down from cocaine into
41:48 a bunch of other derivatives to make it
41:50 cheap then to make the high real
41:51 powerful same thing with cigarettes some
41:54 cigarette brands have up to 1500
41:56 chemicals they add to the tobacco to
41:59 dilute it so they can make a lot more
42:01 cigarettes out of it in recent years
42:04 they found out that the filter itself
42:06 the fibers from the filter being inhaled
42:08 into the lungs and a microscopic level
42:10 it's shredding your sacs in your lungs
42:14 and once you lose your sacs you don't
42:16 get them back you die that's what lung
42:19 cancer does to you the cancer grows on
42:21 your sacs who kills you it's always
42:24 furia it's always inferior 18 when we
42:26 get taxed and have to listen to the same
42:29 [ __ ] we smoke cigar cigars are 100 less
42:32 you do acid cigars or tasty cigars the
42:34 ones that have the additives to it don't
42:36 ever smoke those if you do that you know
42:38 you're smoking at your own risk but this
42:40 thing right here I'm holding in my hand
42:42 is 100% tobacco 300 people have touched
42:46 this thing before I get to smoking no
42:48 matter how cheap the stick is this's
42:49 machine-made but even if it's machine
42:51 made to get down to 250 it does displace
42:55 your sugar levels and you know but the
42:57 even the was that the FDA their
43:01 calculator online when I first started
43:03 smoking these in 2009 I went up there
43:04 cuz I wanna get cancer or something they
43:07 said if you made any sushi for migratory
43:09 fish you had a mercury poisoning
43:12 percentage if you smoked any cigarettes
43:15 you're definitely the cancer index but
43:17 in order to use the cigar calculator
43:19 which they've removed you had to smoke
43:21 six cigars a day and inhale them you
43:25 cannot inhale a cigar we don't inhale
43:27 these things they're just the puffing
43:29 thing right so a little bit of the
43:31 tobacco goes into your saliva and
43:32 displaces your sugar levels which makes
43:34 you calm and cool and even Tesla said
43:37 that he smoked tobacco I believe in a
43:39 pipe a pipe tobacco and cigars Abeka are
43:42 almost identical except even pipe
43:44 tobacco as flavoring in it so this is
43:46 more raw and more healthy in comparison
43:50 but these emissions are messing with our
43:53 bodies in the last year because of 5g a
43:57 bunch of doctors have gone to City
43:59 Hall's who are all paid off chills to
44:03 tell them how dangerous 4G is the G
44:06 stands for generation by the way it's
44:08 different than your home router the G
44:09 there is gigahertz typically the 4G and
44:14 5 G's the next generation up rate but it
44:18 creates diabetes in humans now I ran a
44:21 game company for 10 years and during
44:25 those 10 years what we discovered was
44:27 well we had a client that called
44:28 diabetes games which is gone now but we
44:32 learned a lot about diabetes making
44:34 these video games because the game was
44:36 that you played it played one of many
44:38 games and it would teach you all about
44:40 your diabetes while you're playing the
44:41 game make sure you did your little blood
44:43 test for the day whenever you're
44:44 supposed to do that
44:46 but insulin which you have to take a
44:49 shot if you're if you're diabetic is you
44:51 don't make enough insulin to process
44:54 your sugar
44:55 but you hear that for years and you
44:56 don't know what that means and the way
44:59 it works is that sugar cannot enter the
45:01 human cell by itself the cell membrane
45:04 the actual brain of the cell itself
45:07 refuses to let sugar in but it lets
45:10 insulin in so the way it works is that
45:13 insulin drops into your system the
45:15 second you're eating sugar and surrounds
45:17 the sugar with insulin and then it goes
45:19 into your cell and it is combusted as
45:21 energy okay when you're next to a bunch
45:27 of high transmission tower stuff what
45:30 ends up happening is is that as the
45:32 insulin is flowing to your bloodstream
45:33 it is susceptible to the wave of energy
45:36 that's penetrating your skin especially
45:38 at these high frequencies of four and
45:40 five G and it starts to vibrate and
45:43 shake the insulin and it's like well
45:46 someone you ever typed on your telephone
45:48 so because of buying you just bumps your
45:50 elbow to mess you up same thing you get
45:53 the wrong k-y-t's right well the insulin
45:55 misses the sugar and then you go into
45:58 insulin shock and you have a bunch of
46:00 unprocessed sugar in your body which
46:02 makes you diabetic it's a fact it comes
46:04 out of the Journal of American medicine
46:06 JAMA these doctors made a point you know
46:09 look I'm reading you certified medical
46:12 documentation I'm not making this up
46:13 that's not conspiracy a sign up a
46:15 YouTube video well what are you gonna do
46:18 it's a trillion dollar business and
46:20 they're gonna pay everyone off just like
46:22 all these third-world countries that
46:23 have horrible toxins in their backyards
46:27 eventually what's going to happen here's
46:30 my prediction the way that we viewed
46:32 cigarettes will the way we view
46:34 cigarettes today is how we're gonna view
46:36 all this wireless technology at the end
46:39 of the century if there's any of us left
46:42 we're gonna go back and go oh my god
46:44 isn't it crazy we put those towers in
46:46 parking lots at schools there's a
46:49 fountain vallye high school down office
46:52 later and bouchard in Fountain Valley
46:54 California they're taking less than what
46:57 two thousand dollars a month to have a
46:58 4G tower and they're right inside their
47:02 property it's up against a football
47:05 field stadium balcony but then again
47:08 it's less than
47:09 probably a hundred 150 feet from the
47:11 school so these kids are trying to study
47:14 and now they're gonna get all this
47:15 eighty D ADHD stuff they're not going to
47:19 score well because the brains aren't
47:20 working properly
47:21 remember the brain works on it just an
47:23 infinitesimal amount of electricity and
47:25 so you get these crackpot shills working
47:31 for the companies that say look it's all
47:34 it's totally different frequency in the
47:36 human mind it's like okay I guess my
47:39 home speaker is also a different
47:42 frequency than my brain but if I stare
47:43 at a speaker and it's jamming white
47:46 noise at my face my brain is not going
47:48 to work that well have you ever noticed
47:50 that when you're in your bathroom and
47:51 you have the fan on you can't think very
47:52 clearly
47:53 turn the fan off and all of a sudden
47:55 boom your brain shows up oh yeah yeah
47:57 there's all the solutions to the
47:58 universe as well if you get next to
48:02 really high power stations there's a big
48:04 tower in San Francisco that has about a
48:07 93 percent leukemia rate at the base for
48:11 every hundred yards that go away from
48:13 this thing the leukemia rates go down
48:17 high tension towers with wires that pump
48:20 you know millions and millions of volts
48:23 of electricity from one place to the
48:24 other and these homes are really cheap
48:26 they're buy them right well there's a
48:29 residual poll coming off of every wire
48:31 it's just ether all chatter coming off
48:33 these wires man again if it was audible
48:36 nobody would buy these homes because if
48:38 you like what huh I can't hear you but
48:40 since it's invisible to the eye and
48:44 invisible to the ear people buy these
48:47 homes like and they're killing it and
48:49 they have problems the the one thing
48:54 that corporations love and I mean love
48:58 especially their attorneys as the second
49:01 you catch cancer there's rarely a cause
49:07 and effect model has been some people
49:09 suing the crap out of Monsanto which
49:11 purchased by somebody I can't remember
49:12 who purchased them but they've they're
49:16 winning you know hundreds of millions of
49:17 dollars in fact some of them won
49:19 billions of dollars but then they go
49:20 back in and renegotiate and cut all the
49:22 money down it's crazy
49:23 even though the jury says pay him four
49:24 times as amount of money that he asked
49:26 for so we have you know in rare cases
49:29 and individuals able to to tie something
49:31 to something else you know but the
49:34 corporation's always play like they
49:35 don't know that their product is bad for
49:37 people one of the documentaries they saw
49:41 was I believe in the Philippines and
49:44 they get they're getting kids hooked on
49:46 tons of cigarettes the cigarette
49:50 companies can run ads on TV and there
49:53 specifically they captured some of their
49:54 documentation and they said you know we
49:57 are here to make kids feel more hip if
49:59 they smoke cigarettes even interviewed
50:00 the kids and these women these young
50:02 girls are like oh I actually am more
50:05 attracted to a man who smokes because
50:06 it's more manly as I take a puff on this
50:10 cigar that's how it's going with all the
50:14 stuff that we're addicted to today I
50:16 keep telling you that the closer you get
50:18 to electromagnetic power supplies like
50:20 the battery in your phone right that's
50:25 what's dangerous about the phones is the
50:28 battery supply because the amount of
50:30 electrons flying off that battery to
50:32 create the antenna pull around your
50:34 phone to make a field that is
50:37 interrupted by the cellular tower right
50:39 it interrupts it and give zeros and ones
50:41 it's Morse code but it's all invisible
50:42 to your eye any one of you especially
50:46 the ladies man if you store those phones
50:48 in your breast pocket or in your pants
50:51 pocket you got your eggs already men the
50:54 men make our eggs right we make our
50:56 stuff right it's made new every time we
51:00 use it up we make new stuff but you
51:01 women have your eggs from birth and to
51:03 ovaries right depending on how soon you
51:07 start your menstrual cycle you could go
51:10 way into your 50s and still have periods
51:12 still drop an egg for those of you start
51:14 at 9 years old but you're going to end
51:15 much quicker and get into menopause a
51:17 lot sooner but if you put our
51:19 electromagnetic field around all your
51:21 eggs you're shattering all the DNA
51:23 inside your eggs I mean you could
51:24 literally shatter and tear ovary all at
51:28 once you know but by habitually putting
51:30 this in your pocket for a few years my
51:32 daughter who's
51:34 chemist by degree when she was in her
51:38 undergrad degree she was she's always
51:41 kinda like and an you know whatever
51:42 chemtrails all this other stuff but she
51:45 did a whole paper on cell phone cancer
51:48 and my god she sent me diagrams of the
51:52 the the chest x-rays and where the
51:54 phones were and we're talking about
51:56 cancer in the shape of the phone men
51:58 unbelievable so let's talk about the sky
52:02 and air we've always had particulates in
52:06 the air depending on what century were
52:08 talking about right burning fires
52:10 burning coal burning coal burning trains
52:14 and for some of us I grew up a trained
52:17 community in Kansas our whole town was
52:20 based off the Santa Fe Railroad it still
52:23 goes through the town every day but when
52:26 those steam ones would come by during
52:29 like celebratory things he smelled that
52:31 coal coming out of the Train man there's
52:34 it's super nostalgic man but unless you
52:37 worked for the railroad you weren't
52:39 getting exposed a ton some of us go into
52:43 garages and you smell the fuel in the
52:45 oil and it's just oh yeah man let's
52:48 let's drag apart some engine let's scrub
52:49 some stuff off the toothbrush for five
52:52 hours right well if you do that every
52:54 single day and you are ingesting a
52:56 particulate and that means anything
52:58 other than oxygen is it particular we're
53:01 not supposed to but we do but there is
53:04 an immune system that fights things off
53:06 it depends on how much you expose
53:08 yourself as to how much your immune
53:10 system can fix the issue
53:12 now Kim trills Kim trills are still
53:17 widely unknown it's almost like they
53:19 fell out of the conspiracy circles which
53:22 is really sad it's almost like your own
53:23 ad [ __ ] it let's just join them right
53:26 but I have interviewed and my co-host
53:28 from the previous show is interviewed at
53:30 least four pilots they all say the same
53:33 thing it's not us they're very real
53:36 you're not allowed to talk about them
53:37 it's easier to talk about a UFO that it
53:40 needs to talk about Kim chose is one of
53:41 them told us air traffic control hides
53:45 them one of my friends said he says you
53:47 know I
53:48 had them in front of me when I'm flying
53:49 and I'll call down say what the hell is
53:53 this plane doing here it's not even
53:55 showing up on my radar anything moves
53:57 out of the way and then you get a call
53:58 back
53:58 never an acknowledging that it existed
54:00 except to say it's out of your way now
54:03 extremely real well what is it dropping
54:06 on us mmm-hmm
54:08 you got to see my episodes on Kim chose
54:10 to really get the full details and go
54:12 see Morgellons the Morgellons disease
54:14 episode as well to get some scary truth
54:17 about that it seems as if the primary
54:20 thing that's dropped in all locations is
54:22 barium oxide and aluminum oxide my take
54:27 on this is that one to get to get rid of
54:31 a bunch of aluminum oxide but it's also
54:32 nano-sized aluminum oxide meaning it has
54:35 been manufactured somewhere and that's
54:37 confirmed by dr. Russell Blaylock who's
54:39 a retired neurologist who chases around
54:41 chemtrails and he chases around
54:43 fluoridation of water because he's seen
54:46 the effect of it on the human body but
54:49 they have a metal dust that's coming out
54:51 in this line but they need to spread it
54:54 out right well why would you have barium
54:56 oxide it's a salt
54:58 it's a conductive salt well let's say
55:02 they spray a Los Angeles with a bunch of
55:03 gridlines but then they hit it with an
55:05 antenna either from another plane or its
55:10 part of the plane
55:11 perhaps but could be another plane that
55:13 flies by or could come from a HAARP
55:14 antenna some derivative of that and then
55:17 what it does is because there is
55:19 electrified you have this thing called
55:20 um infrasonic undulation which is to
55:24 vibrate the air and then it spreads out
55:27 into what looks like a cloud again the
55:30 greatest trick you can play on a friend
55:33 especially a kid but another grown
55:35 adults even more phenomenal is that
55:37 you're going into a restaurant so you're
55:38 going to go into a fast food restaurants
55:40 middle of the day and you can see them
55:42 spraying and you ask the person what do
55:45 you what do you think those things are
55:46 what do you mean those lines coming out
55:48 of the back of planes you're gonna hear
55:49 the word contra okay go in and eat come
55:53 back in 30 minutes point right back up
55:55 to where that white line was and it's
55:57 now looking like a cloud and then you
55:59 want you to ask that person what's that
56:01 thing right there
56:01 what do you mean oh that white stuff up
56:04 there what is that oh that's a cloud you
56:05 idiot not realizing it's the same exact
56:08 substance that they just said was a
56:10 contrail contrails do not persist and
56:12 cut rails do not spread out
56:13 volumetrically it's impossible now
56:17 they've invented some [ __ ] theories
56:19 online especially Wikipedia and smokes
56:21 all [ __ ] [ __ ]
56:23 seriously Prairie there's no God if
56:25 you're right in that crap but they've
56:28 got some theories of why things expand
56:30 all of a sudden but when I was a kid the
56:31 stuff didn't exist one of the reasons
56:34 why I know that my father was a
56:35 photographer for weddings he was a
56:38 photographer every place we went none of
56:41 my albums as a kid have any of this crap
56:43 in the sky but you couldn't possibly
56:44 film a wedding today like my father did
56:48 to a three a month without having
56:50 chemtrails in the skies that if you
56:52 wanted this guy to be blue and it to be
56:53 a wonderful picture you'd have to tell
56:55 the touch up people to pull those out
56:58 Hollywood's average budget for a period
57:02 piece like say they're gonna do Game of
57:04 Thrones or some post-apocalyptic thing
57:07 where there's no planes in the sky it's
57:09 a million to three million dollars a
57:11 post-production to remove these lines
57:13 out this guy that never existed in the
57:16 past
57:16 okay and the past there were films made
57:19 near Air Force bases with their test
57:21 flying jets and when Jets do
57:23 afterburners you will get a definite
57:25 SuperDuper contrail our fuel dumps or
57:28 all kinds of like exhaust but those
57:30 engines are not in your average 737 or
57:33 up to 787 3 so in terms of the now
57:37 that's a huge one this is just the
57:40 physical nature of your existence right
57:43 now I haven't even gotten to political
57:45 problems or globalism I mean that kind
57:46 of stuff right okay now you need to see
57:54 my episode on cancer okay it's in this
57:58 season I redid it you need to see it no
58:01 matter what because if you want to keep
58:04 your immune system at absolute peak
58:06 condition here's the formula okay I
58:09 cover a lot of different techniques of
58:11 curing an instance of cancer there is no
58:14 cure
58:15 cancer in that you would be able to
58:16 consume one product it would be able to
58:19 augment your immune system forever right
58:22 so you can catch cancer one one day by
58:24 one thing cure it as long as you catch
58:27 it early enough and then go ten years
58:30 twenty years get some other toxification
58:31 on your system but one of the means I
58:34 just mentioned and then hear it again
58:36 they're trying to demonize a vitamin to
58:40 actually they want to make vitamin C
58:42 prescription only they're trying to do
58:46 that behind your back
58:47 b-17 has already been banned in
58:49 Australia most people don't know about
58:51 b-17 then it would be six and me this
58:54 would be that but not be b10 I think is
58:56 also really expensive but b-17 is found
59:00 in apricot pits it's all throughout sort
59:02 of pits in nature and the technically
59:08 speaking what it does the cancer is what
59:10 they call the cyanide effect it actually
59:12 kills cancer but by killing other things
59:17 in your body like viruses flus bacteria
59:20 in your body it basically leaves your
59:22 immune system the Maytag man where it is
59:24 nothing that for it to do relatively
59:27 speaking and so your immune system is
59:30 infinitely powerful your immune system
59:32 can do anything and so you take see
59:37 every single day no matter what I take
59:39 an eight hour time release plastic
59:41 capsule with powder in it the brand I
59:44 take is called solar ray to spell the
59:47 word solar like Sun and had a while knee
59:50 and the bottles are now kind of white
59:52 transparent they got a little rainbow on
59:53 the top best brand in the world I take a
59:57 zinc copper pill as well because zinc
59:58 fights copper absorption copper and
60:00 fights zinc absorption take them
60:03 together the b-17 the the regiment's
60:08 I've I've heard patients who have cured
60:10 themselves of stage four and I've taken
60:12 now three people through it but the
60:14 fourth I'm waiting to get the results on
60:16 but they cure themselves within four
60:19 months and the regimen is thousand
60:23 milligrams a day at b-17 which is about
60:25 a hundred dollar bottle but one bottle
60:26 should last you I think about a month
60:28 it's two tits two pills a day but with
60:33 time we release pills especially see you
60:34 can do something called stacking where
60:36 you take a see every hour on the hour
60:38 for your first 36 hours or so so
60:43 eventually you'll have you know anywhere
60:47 from ten to twenty thousand milligrams
60:48 of C to shock your system to just
60:51 absolutely annihilate a bunch of bad
60:53 invaders in your body
60:54 maybe not the cancer for the C but then
60:56 you're letting the immune system do its
60:58 job and just so you know it's not
61:01 hocus-pocus it's physics okay the C and
61:05 the B 17 shed electrons and as it does
61:08 so it kills by shattering all of the
61:12 bacterial invaders in your body and the
61:14 RNA invaders in your body from the viral
61:16 standpoint all those are a lot tougher
61:17 to hurt but even if it can't touch your
61:20 irony because it's a real aggressive rn8
61:21 your immune system will kill it okay so
61:24 b-17s ejection of electron is stronger
61:29 than the objection of a see that's why
61:31 you take both of them together they call
61:34 the C to b-17 a catalyst meaning it
61:38 makes the b-17 more powerful they're
61:40 trying to ban it because they want
61:42 cancer to stay on this planet again
61:44 cancer is a hundred percent man-made
61:46 product in virtually all cases the only
61:49 possible case okay as if you were like
61:53 living in Africa or wherever they did
61:55 uranium and you're playing with your aim
61:57 as a kid you know yeah you can wipe
61:58 yourself out with that stuff okay so
62:01 what do we do moving up from us our own
62:05 personal health well we sort of have
62:08 what they typically refer to as the
62:09 geopolitical environment conditions of
62:12 the world and I will tell you that
62:13 having watched these ten documentaries
62:16 it is apparent that the problems around
62:19 the world are completely different and
62:21 that the third-world countries are all
62:23 inheriting our old problems of which we
62:26 did unknowingly they're now doing them
62:30 unknowingly except now the corporation's
62:32 know scientifically that they are
62:36 putting these people at a fatal risk
62:39 okay
62:40 the textile companies
62:42 Indonesia dropping I don't know is 600
62:45 chemicals into their water lead is in
62:48 all their food now all their rice is
62:51 just full of deadly lead which will go
62:53 right your brain and make you screwed up
62:56 the I think it was Uganda takes a bunch
63:02 of the electrical trash that we have
63:04 from Europe and America and their method
63:06 of recycling is to burn it all so
63:09 imagine a copper wire with a bunch of
63:11 rubber on it a bunch of other bio
63:14 friendly toxins in it when you burn it
63:16 and they burn it and they're sitting
63:19 there inhaling all the smoke coming off
63:20 the wire all the rubber that's burning
63:22 they're inhaling it down to the point
63:24 where the only thing left is the copper
63:25 wire and they take that off to get it
63:27 recycled but they're exposing their kids
63:30 to it themselves to it it's it's really
63:32 dangerous there's a tin mining digging
63:39 out 10 from big clumps of dirt and you
63:42 know they're exposing themselves to all
63:44 these toxins gold rushing today and when
63:48 you have a bunch of gold dust if you
63:49 wanted to turn it into a nugget you put
63:50 some mercury in there and then you burn
63:52 it over a fire and a little skillet and
63:55 it makes the gold I'll come together
63:57 into a nugget while the mercury burns
63:59 off into the air well they're breathing
64:01 that - its atrocious man what's going on
64:05 around the world and that's why they
64:08 keep they keep these areas horribly
64:10 repressed financially such that they
64:13 can't they can't imagine another way of
64:19 life right what was it one of them was
64:22 growing cocoa seeds and the Ghana these
64:28 other ones growing tobacco and they used
64:31 to grow corn which was nice and you know
64:34 easy to sell but someone told them oh
64:36 tobacco sells for a lot more so they
64:38 switched their crops out and now for
64:40 whatever reason they can't go back to
64:41 corn and when you handle tobacco
64:45 something I didn't know is that you do
64:47 absorb a ton of the nicotine when you
64:50 when you handle it and it you know
64:52 that's like probably smoking I don't
64:53 know boxing cigars
64:55 which would be good for anybody right so
64:58 all these health issues but what is the
65:00 first world thing that's going on is
65:02 really frustrating we have some you know
65:05 people going around the world trying to
65:07 scare us about the climate they're
65:09 bothering citizens first and foremost
65:13 which is the first faux pas of the
65:15 formula we're not making the decisions
65:17 about what our energy is made from we're
65:20 not deciding that there's a petrol
65:21 dollar out there that it's valued on the
65:23 sell of a barrel of oil
65:24 I don't decide my car runs on gas or
65:27 coal to turn the lights on and make this
65:30 show possible I'm not making those
65:32 decisions
65:32 so these Greta thumb bugs need to be
65:35 talking to the bankers the World Bank
65:36 the IMF the kings and queens of the
65:39 world that you know as atrocious as they
65:42 are in existence presidents of our
65:45 country the Ford Motor Company Exxon you
65:49 know BP that's how they should be
65:51 talking to instead they're trying to
65:53 punish us at the bottom to pay for the
65:56 switchover for the people above us right
65:59 they made the choices way above us
66:01 hundred years ago by 1830 or so and then
66:05 now they want to have us pay for the
66:08 change you'll see my energy episode so
66:12 my favorite episodes was really cranky
66:14 in it one of the things I opened the
66:16 episode with is raise your hand if you
66:18 pick nuclear power raise your hand if
66:20 you picked oil coal anything that's
66:23 demonized today none of you did and none
66:25 of your grandparents did either you woke
66:28 up a life and you started using this
66:30 stuff so don't lecture me man lecture
66:33 those who control that environment and
66:37 make their trillion dollar bank accounts
66:40 pay for [ __ ] but what's the name of the
66:44 game with climate change why are we
66:48 hearing about this because they're
66:50 bothering first world countries when I
66:53 moved to Los Angeles in 1987 the air
66:56 would suffocate you my uncle went to
66:58 optometry school in Los Angeles and the
67:01 50s he said it was impossible to breathe
67:05 Shanghai Beijing
67:08 still today you can't breathe a you have
67:11 oxygen machines in Tokyo okay
67:15 la you wouldn't know that we ever had an
67:18 air problem if you went downtown today
67:19 I don't even on a busy day when I lived
67:22 in San Francisco they have smog Bay's
67:24 smog alert days and man it would burn
67:26 your lungs like you're breathing a toxic
67:29 fumes burn like little needles inside
67:33 your chest it's amazing I lived through
67:36 that I think it's largely cleaned up so
67:40 first of all countries are at the utter
67:42 precipice of cleaning up everything of
67:44 catalytic converters and we have we have
67:47 an emissions package that they exist in
67:50 California don't know if it exists in
67:52 other states but it costs jesus 20 years
67:54 ago was five hundred dollars more in
67:56 your car they've kind of kept it there
67:58 because they know every car has to have
67:59 and they don't want to drive up sticker
68:01 price too much in California weary of
68:04 where have you never seen Gretta never
68:07 seen her in China never seen her in
68:10 India because it's not about climate
68:14 change the climate is changing but it's
68:17 like natural in fact it's getting colder
68:18 it's the middle it's the mini ice age
68:21 era that we're in right now
68:22 now they spray the sky to control the
68:25 weather to create anomalies like I said
68:27 my weather manipulation episode which is
68:30 just a couple weeks back I tell you all
68:32 the methods they use to fake the things
68:35 are getting hotter again don't forget Al
68:37 Gore said Montse doe Montecito would be
68:40 underwater by 2010 in his December 2006
68:44 movie An Inconvenient bunch of [ __ ]
68:47 he now owns a house in Montecito and the
68:50 water hasn't gone up at all but boy do
68:53 you have people repeating this stuff
68:55 like parrots because they want to be
68:57 important and they want to feel superior
68:59 to you because the second that you don't
69:01 buy their [ __ ] they automatically go
69:03 home thinking they're smarter all right
69:05 so we have theories like the Big Bang
69:07 well housewife now can tell her
69:09 housewife right next door you know a
69:11 universal scream [ __ ] big explosions
69:14 man well goddamn you must be from
69:19 Cambridge University but
69:21 wheelchair fella project Veritas just
69:25 stung ABC and the dude that they stung I
69:28 don't remember his name but he said it
69:30 perfectly which was actually fairly
69:32 heartwarming for me to hear a leftist
69:35 senior journalist say the truth he said
69:38 look commercialism and news cannot be
69:41 mixed together otherwise you get fake
69:43 news and that's what we have now we're
69:47 just going after or following ambulances
69:49 at this point trying to make people
69:51 watch our program so we synthesize up
69:54 you know scandals that don't exist
69:56 Russia Russia Russia kind of crap right
69:59 climate change is all about depopulation
70:02 and because you guys have heard it so
70:05 much I'm only gonna say a little
70:07 footnote to this so brace you know don't
70:10 worry you're not gonna get bored to
70:12 death they discovered that once they
70:14 started using oil in this world the
70:18 population went up so as energy goes up
70:21 so does the population so in order to
70:24 correct the problem and the only reason
70:26 why it's being corrected is because the
70:28 elite are afraid that too many of us
70:30 will exist and we'll take them out
70:32 that's the only reason why the world is
70:34 not even remotely overpopulated now
70:37 consumption marketing departments can
70:39 kill the world in two seconds by making
70:41 something too popular right that we
70:43 don't need in this world so we have
70:46 issues like I saw a documentary on the
70:51 pig market in China China is now
70:54 starting to eat meat for the very first
70:56 time and swine's are great because they
70:59 populate like crazy and boy they provide
71:01 some protein for you but they have to
71:03 feed those animals right they consume
71:07 twice the amount of pigs / meat then
71:11 America does but the average individual
71:13 only consumes 25% of what an American
71:16 ingest but I think they kind of
71:19 understand the eating meat makes you
71:21 have a bigger brain it makes bigger
71:24 people right and if you don't think that
71:27 that's true you've got to go to the
71:28 Midwest and just measure the the farm
71:31 boys and the major the city kids one of
71:34 them is Johnny Depp
71:35 and the other ones the rock and that's
71:37 the big difference right
71:38 Hawaiian Polynesians they eat the crap
71:41 out of pork right but so the fear is is
71:45 that if China continues to increase its
71:47 pig population they're gonna have to
71:49 start knocking down rainforests and
71:51 Brazil just sold theirs right off to the
71:53 Chinese man just boom
71:55 so they clear the forest down to grow
71:58 soybeans so they can feed their pigs so
72:00 they need meat when China itself is not
72:04 even remotely completely captured in
72:07 terms of farming potential but hey if
72:10 you can hurt someone else's backyard why
72:12 not do it if you have no morals and
72:14 again because there's a difference
72:17 between rich and poor nobody gives a
72:19 [ __ ] right they're so poor you can't
72:21 give a [ __ ] or you're so rich it's like
72:23 hey I like being at a party and so you
72:26 know what we cut down a whole rain
72:27 forest so you could have either have
72:29 this bacon with your food Rea there's
72:33 one other thing I want to throw back on
72:35 the health risk thing they demonized egg
72:39 yolks around 1980 in America and
72:44 dementia and Alzheimer's started to
72:46 skyrocket
72:47 now we've always had dementia
72:50 Alzheimer's is pretty new the amyloid
72:52 plaque problem in the brain but
72:55 demonizing egg yolks was one of the
72:57 stupidest things they ever did because
73:00 the cholesterol in an egg yolk is the
73:02 good kind of cholesterol you need in
73:03 your body hands down go ask anybody
73:06 who's a fitness trainer a nutritionist
73:08 they'll tell you and if they don't
73:10 they're still suckin on some propaganda
73:12 but the gray matter in your brain isn't
73:14 formed from the exact same carbohydrate
73:16 that is in an egg yolk and when you're
73:20 don't eat it your gray matter starts to
73:23 deteriorate but then your neurons that
73:25 are held apart by grey matter start to
73:28 touch each other and that's when your
73:30 brain starts losing memories and you
73:32 start remembering your past not your
73:34 present right you forget where you are
73:37 and all that kind of stuff
73:38 Biden's got plenty of those problems but
73:41 I talked to a guy who's a big campaign
73:43 dude and he told me that Biden for the
73:46 people that take care of that guy he
73:48 said he's good
73:49 about the time he wakes up in the
73:50 morning to about noon and in the evening
73:52 he's just loony because he's
73:56 deteriorating he's got that problem so
73:59 what they're trying to do with carbon
74:00 credits is make it too expensive for you
74:03 to procreate again rolls on
74:07 overpopulated it could be very quickly
74:09 you know by the end of this century if
74:11 we were on the current path thorium
74:13 which is almost a straight up arrow of
74:14 population growth which is really the
74:17 culprit of China India and South America
74:20 even Africa can't overpopulate because
74:23 they got that place so locked down you
74:26 know like you know I don't even know
74:27 what the percentage is but I'm gonna I'm
74:29 gonna get make a guess that maybe 80% of
74:31 Africa has no power or running water I
74:34 mean they've got that place locked down
74:36 so we can't expand you know so carbon
74:41 credits it's a joke it's a joke
74:45 and as I've said to you guys and you
74:47 absolutely positively have to watch if
74:49 you're interested in this because I
74:50 can't possibly repeat everything I said
74:51 in a previous episode but the agenda 21
74:54 is the umbrella from the entire world
74:58 operation at this point from the
75:00 globalists down to us if you hear about
75:02 any other program it is a sub program to
75:05 agenda 21 the genes-- 21 was signed by a
75:08 hundred and fifty nine countries in
75:10 nineteen ninety two or three and it's
75:12 been in operation since now in America
75:17 agenda 21 makes someone roll their eyes
75:18 it's conspiracy in Europe they meet
75:21 every single year every ten years they
75:23 have a huge agenda twenty one summit for
75:25 the EU so over there it's fact over here
75:29 it's fiction isn't that interesting how
75:31 they can quarantine our brains in the
75:33 21st century with the Internet
75:35 when there's a link in the description
75:37 of that video for Rosa Cory ko IR II and
75:41 I'm gonna mention her demographic for
75:44 one reason is that she is the least
75:48 likely person to support Donald Trump
75:49 but now she's a trump supporter I I
75:54 would guess that she's probably in her
75:55 mid-50s she's a lesbian and she's
75:58 liberal our sorry libertarian excuse me
76:01 she is turn
76:03 by training she used to handle the
76:06 evaluation of land grabs by the state of
76:09 California and what we call eminent
76:10 domain in America where they steal your
76:12 land and give you ten cents on the
76:13 dollar if not less I don't know how many
76:16 years she did this job but she did this
76:18 job and then she started seeing kind of
76:22 a shadow government underneath the state
76:24 of California people couldn't get their
76:26 their land that they owned zoned for the
76:29 smallest thing I think she mentioned one
76:31 was guy had over 4,000 acres of land in
76:33 Northern California
76:34 he just wanted it zoned to build a
76:36 little structure and they wouldn't give
76:38 it to him so he said [ __ ] you I'm gonna
76:41 build this thing anyway it's my land
76:42 what do you mean I can't build it's not
76:44 there's no turtle endangerment it's not
76:46 a wetland
76:47 it's just land and when they found out
76:50 they went up there and find him for
76:54 doing it find him every day that it took
76:56 him to clean it up and they said yep
76:58 take all this down and you have to
76:59 restore the ground of the way it was
77:00 before you did it which is impossible of
77:02 course they are working with all of the
77:06 people in the world that will take a
77:08 check which is nearly every politician
77:10 on planet Earth and they're working with
77:14 people that are appointed like the FDA
77:16 CDC EPA they're all appointed people so
77:20 you can just Lobby someone straight into
77:21 the sheet of potential hires and you get
77:25 the job and you're just you're just
77:28 changing the world to this globalist
77:29 thing right it shouldn't be any mystery
77:33 to you that the you know what's
77:36 interesting is I open the show with now
77:38 short term long term right right now as
77:42 of 2020 it's a very interesting time to
77:44 make this episode because all of those
77:46 agendas are compressing into the
77:49 activation moment right now what they're
77:52 trying to do right now they've been
77:54 trying to do for several years but
77:55 they're an overdrive right now is that
77:58 they are trying to create this huge
78:01 depopulation event and then they're
78:04 going to move everyone out of the rural
78:06 areas by law into major cities and then
78:09 survey the [ __ ] out of them right I
78:12 would say that if they were to succeed
78:14 which they won't
78:16 at least in America they won't I think
78:20 Paris France is fighting back to Hong
78:21 Kong is fighting back
78:23 you know humanity won't allow freedom to
78:26 be removed and any shield that is
78:28 willing to take away someone else's
78:30 freedom without a crime is a disposable
78:33 human being don't know if you can
78:36 rebuild take them you know once you
78:38 become consumeristic she'll that'll take
78:41 money for some short-term gain for the
78:45 long-term destruction of your own
78:47 society and your own people then you're
78:49 the biggest scumbag on the planet and
78:53 there seems to be because of this this
78:55 difference between rich and poor they
78:57 know how to create that event it's super
78:59 easy and then they create an event where
79:01 someone is suffering so much they take
79:03 the money they murder people the the
79:06 sand mafia thing they were talking to
79:09 one of the gentlemen that his father was
79:13 noticing the sand being taken out of his
79:16 field and was screwing up the water
79:18 irrigation that was killing all this all
79:20 of his money and so he was reporting it
79:22 to the authorities which were already
79:23 paid off which was naive but they came
79:26 into his house and ak47 him in his bed
79:30 killed him and in the documentary they
79:33 think they actually went up and talked
79:34 to the guy that actually pulled the
79:35 trigger who was kind of lightly
79:37 threatening the British film team but
79:40 she knew that she's a British citizen so
79:42 if an Indian citizen killed a British
79:45 citizen shit's gonna change right so he
79:49 didn't he didn't go too far in it but he
79:51 was definitely saying that you know the
79:52 people who are here who live here are
79:54 now in danger because you're filming us
79:57 doing this illegal thing but if they
79:59 were to get their way our ability to
80:02 predict how bad the world would be in
80:06 those concentration camp cities which is
80:09 what Rosa Cory calls them I don't think
80:13 we could fathom how bad those
80:16 environments could be at all because the
80:22 this discrepancy between the rich and
80:24 the poor that creates this environment
80:25 that I'm talking about would be enforced
80:29 by disease
80:30 right every citizen in the world we're
80:32 talking about you know let's just say
80:35 that they reduce world population in
80:36 their estimation of a maximum of 500
80:40 million people which is on the rows of
80:42 guy Georgia Guidestones who rose against
80:44 Jones hers would be awesome
80:46 the Georgia Guidestones which in the
80:48 first commandment on there's to remain
80:49 teen world population under 500 million
80:52 perpetual balance with nature let's say
80:55 there was 500 million there won't be
80:56 they'll be a lot less okay but if let's
80:59 say they peaked it out how many people
81:02 do you think would actually run the
81:03 world at that point I would say with the
81:08 respective monarchies that you Europeans
81:11 allow that to exist and the bankers that
81:13 live over there and the bankers that we
81:15 allow live over here
81:16 we don't purge George Soros is off this
81:18 planet and probably some neocon Koch
81:21 brothers and stuff I don't even think
81:23 they're really in the crowd either they
81:25 just live in Sedgwick County I dunno was
81:28 a Johnson County Kansas I don't think
81:32 they're part of a big big echelon but I
81:36 think you would have probably I don't
81:38 know two or three thousand people of the
81:41 families but probably only a few hundred
81:43 maybe maybe a few dozen that would
81:46 dictate the entire world's operations
81:49 what clothes you are allowed to wear
81:50 what haircut you're allowed to have what
81:53 way you're allowed to learn what you're
81:54 allowed to do everything would be
81:55 dictated to you your whole life would
81:58 come an email or a printout and that's
82:02 what you would have to do for the rest
82:04 of your life your freedom would be so
82:07 utterly gone with it I don't know I mean
82:10 I don't even know what freedom would be
82:11 at that point I got to sit on the toilet
82:14 for extra 60 seconds whoa what a great
82:16 day right that's why I think they sound
82:23 like a broken record to the hardcore
82:24 listeners but thx 1138 George Lucas's
82:27 first film that's probably a pretty good
82:32 estimate of how the world would work and
82:34 if you haven't seen that movie you need
82:36 to go see it you can see it for free on
82:38 Netflix you know he named his sound
82:41 company after a thx
82:43 and one one 3/8 all throughout his
82:46 movies the president sell that Princess
82:49 Leia was in was walnut 3/8 so the other
82:53 great threat to our life in the short
82:56 term one I think is socialism
83:00 I think voting for candidates that want
83:03 socialism means that your grasp of
83:05 reality is in the negative every single
83:09 communist the country started off with
83:11 socialism every single dictator that's
83:13 ever killed tens of millions of now
83:16 hundreds of millions of their own people
83:17 started with socialism and a gun grab so
83:21 too what that means that you know find a
83:24 bridge and start depopulating would you
83:27 not read that today pretty funny we have
83:32 this this coronavirus thing going around
83:34 which is actually interesting for the
83:36 topic and someone wants me to cover it i
83:37 will only cover it after it's gone
83:40 because or if it goes to another stage
83:42 where we I think we really understand
83:43 what's happening here there's an old
83:47 saying hunter s Thompson remind us of
83:50 this saying on the day of September 11th
83:53 2001 and he took a radio interview and
83:57 he said you know they said well who you
84:00 think did this this is before a couple
84:02 hours later they were like oh it's
84:03 definitely Osama bin Laden blah blah
84:05 blah blah he said one thing could you
84:08 look at who benefits from this
84:11 and he goes then I think you'll find out
84:13 who did it
84:14 now that guy's a very strange guy but
84:18 boy did he nail it didn't he
84:19 now that we know about 9/11 and who did
84:22 it and why they did it we don't know all
84:24 the reasons why they did it we don't
84:26 know all the first names of everybody
84:27 who did everything but there's been some
84:29 deathbed confessions of people that blew
84:30 up building seven saying they blew it up
84:33 to to cleanly they thought that was
84:35 gonna get caught there's Crona viruses
84:38 accomplished two things and the
84:40 listeners on our facebook group know
84:41 this for a fact as they posted about it
84:43 but Hong Kong had really a couple
84:47 problems they had Hong Kong protesters
84:50 continuing to fight to keep mainland
84:52 China away from Hong Kong because Hong
84:55 Kong for those of you
84:56 was under British rule for a hundred
84:59 years as a as a lease is just 100 but
85:03 they lost the lease in the late 90s and
85:05 of course it took a long time to figure
85:08 out how the hell to absorb that from the
85:09 mainland China but now they're trying to
85:11 push communism into China and to Hong
85:14 Kong and Hong Kong has enjoyed freedom
85:16 real freedom and so they're like no way
85:20 you know they they trying to detain
85:22 people into mainland China to squash
85:25 free thinkers while trying to facilitate
85:28 the migration from mainland China into
85:30 Hong Kong by setting up families with
85:32 tons of money to move in and buy
85:34 property and basically cleanse it
85:36 genetically freedom
85:40 so the coronavirus has cleared the
85:42 streets in Hong Kong I mean it's I think
85:44 it's coming back here shortly but now
85:47 whether or not it's a real virus or fake
85:49 virus you know I know it's heresy to
85:52 even suggest such a thing because we've
85:55 seen videos of people falling down the
85:56 streets there's a couple things about
85:58 those videos that don't jive and I'll
86:02 tell you two examples one I've seen
86:04 probably a dozen videos of people lying
86:06 on the ground as a result of supposedly
86:09 dying from this this flu and they're
86:12 bleeding out of their faces that you
86:15 could say maybe they fell and hit their
86:16 face and then that broke their nose and
86:18 they're bleeding for that reason maybe
86:19 that's the reason why that's occurring
86:20 there certainly be seems to be almost a
86:23 unanimous situation there another one is
86:26 the surveillance shot of a guy working
86:28 as a security guard at a desk and he
86:31 seems to be kind of you know lethargic
86:32 and then he suddenly starts screaming
86:36 this horrible gut wrenching scream
86:39 literally the gut wrenching is what it
86:40 sounded like great it's like a deep
86:42 guttural scream and he falls down the
86:44 ground and he's dead
86:46 well I'm not aware of a flu that does
86:49 that to you flu kills you by infecting
86:52 your body with such a viral infection
86:53 it's so aggressive on RNA DNA strand
86:56 level that your body overheats trying to
86:59 kill it and you pass out some people
87:03 falling down on the streets it just you
87:04 know boom them on the ground that makes
87:05 more sense to me then bleeding out and I
87:08 don't understand what that is right
87:10 Ebola will make you bleed out of every
87:12 orifice in your body totally different
87:14 thing so it it also it's gonna rebound
87:23 here shortly and anyone who sold their
87:24 stock as a results of the corona virus
87:26 is gonna be very very pissed off with
87:29 their broker or if they did it
87:32 themselves what what idiots so there
87:36 we've had like about a twenty four
87:38 hundred plus it's gonna change this
87:41 number is not gonna be right when you're
87:42 but about twenty five hundred point drop
87:45 in the stock market which is up fifty
87:47 seven percent or some [ __ ] right it's a
87:49 big deal when they in they they say it's
87:53 because the corona virus and it's just a
87:55 ludicrous assertion it's if that's a
87:57 that's an excuse for an absolute you
88:00 know a person is complete ignorant about
88:02 how economics work what someone made a
88:05 bunch of phone call did you ever bow the
88:06 coronavirus you know the Sal Sal Sal
88:08 well every time you sell what happens
88:12 but you get a little bit of money in
88:13 your pocket so okay so a bunch of people
88:15 sold their stocks at a really high level
88:17 about cry me a [ __ ] River when you
88:20 take all that money into your bank
88:21 account but it does drive down the
88:23 stocks well when you know it's a bunch
88:26 of fake propaganda I mean regardless of
88:29 this virus being real or fake doesn't
88:30 matter it doesn't affect the stock
88:32 market right yeah some facts your some
88:34 factories have been delayed a month or
88:36 two but it was also Chinese New Year
88:38 they were already shut down for a month
88:40 anyway okay so factories are coming back
88:44 online I got friends and shinjin my
88:46 buddy has all his musical instruments
88:48 made in China they're coming back online
88:50 next Monday okay so it's all gonna start
88:54 back up again yeah there have some
88:56 backlog the Chinese people work hard so
88:57 they'll get it done great if there's one
89:01 thing Chinese people do they work their
89:02 asses off and they enjoy it yeah because
89:05 they like what they do in some cases
89:07 rate these the two people that I know
89:10 okay so the stocks go down well if you
89:13 know you're pumping and dumping using
89:16 coronavirus as an excuse well then you
89:18 go and buy all those stocks a lot lot
89:20 lower then you wait for her to go back
89:22 up because you know there's no reason
89:23 it's down in the first place you made it
89:25 up and if you were to do that formally
89:29 in the United States of America of
89:30 Goldman Sachs put out a fake alarm and
89:34 got a bunch of stocks to sell people
89:37 will go to jail because you can't
89:39 manipulate the market with fear like
89:41 that at least if it's a complete fraud
89:43 right so anyway that's all gonna repair
89:47 but what's interesting about it is you
89:51 know what is it we haven't had a single
89:52 person dying United States of America
89:54 but the Democrats are trying to you know
89:55 blame Trump for this whole thing it's
89:57 just like unbelievable how low these
90:01 people will go to get their socialism
90:04 right now you have to understand that
90:07 there are people that really do believe
90:09 in socialism right they really do
90:12 believe it'll work and the beautiful
90:14 thing is is that by allowing people like
90:16 Bernie Sanders to come out and lie about
90:18 you know Fidel Castro you know his big
90:22 thing was the Fidel Castro launched a
90:24 literary program for his citizens the
90:26 second that he took over the country he
90:28 doesn't tell you is the literary works
90:30 that they were reading was the communist
90:31 manifesto it was a reconditioning
90:35 reprogramming doctrine to make his
90:40 people believed in what he was doing
90:42 well go look at Cuba go look at it it's
90:46 still in the 50s man people driving on
90:49 old cars from the 50s it's the last time
90:52 they saw a modern society we're the two
90:55 main products tobacco and sugar cream
90:59 sugar cane right okay man they do make
91:02 some good cigars let me tell you the
91:05 word on the street is that a lot of
91:06 Cubans have new world tobacco in them
91:08 because there's no way they can
91:09 physically keep up Adam and so the only
91:14 Americans are sanctioned from the normal
91:17 sales like we can go over nowadays and
91:19 buy $800 worth of cigars for personal
91:21 use but you know and the assertion is is
91:25 that if I were to take a like if I paid
91:27 20 bucks for a Cuban cigar which would
91:29 be a really expensive cigar in Cuba and
91:31 then my friend wants to buy it off of me
91:33 because I'm like I'm not gonna give the
91:34 [ __ ] thing away for free it's like
91:36 okay we'll give me 20 bucks dude
91:37 so I went to it for so there's a lot of
91:39 misunderstandings vial that could work
91:41 anyway I rarely smoke Cubans anymore
91:44 because they're just too expensive
91:45 they're good they're great I made a
91:48 video about if you guys are interested a
91:49 bunch of you asked me to make a cigar
91:51 video just look up cigar the word in the
91:54 search engine of this channel and you'll
91:55 find them you'll find to to at least two
91:57 cigar videos on that but anyway as I've
92:03 said in several videos recently this
92:05 year in 2020 if you really want to know
92:10 what's your greatest threat you know
92:12 your health is probably the most
92:13 profound threat because you know if
92:17 you're not healthy what can you do the
92:20 the medical industry is designed to
92:21 bleed you dry and the hospice is the
92:26 next level of that where you know I've
92:29 got a friend of mine again whose father
92:30 is dying slowly of advanced Parkinson's
92:35 and the poor guy you know work till he
92:38 was 79 to get maximum benefits out of
92:41 Social Security and then he retired and
92:43 immediately was diagnosed with
92:45 Parkinson's so he never got a break his
92:47 whole life which is why it's important
92:50 to read Rich Dad Poor Dad
92:52 and learn the difference between you
92:55 know valuing your life by how much you
92:57 work for the man right ladies there you
93:01 know there's no job you can have that
93:03 should bring more satisfaction than
93:05 being a mother but raising some kids and
93:08 really staying on them and really
93:09 raising them and not just send them off
93:11 to the schools and stuff and then you
93:14 could do whatever else you want but
93:15 working for the man is a game that the
93:17 men have been trying to escape for ever
93:19 right the rat races we call it the rat
93:21 race for a reason the women are like let
93:23 me into the rat race I'll prove that I'm
93:25 a I'm a woman I'm prove that I'm an
93:27 equal to a man asleep hey us guys have
93:31 been slaving in the rat race to provide
93:33 homes before we lost the single income
93:35 household in the 70s due to the movement
93:38 itself the feminist movement
93:39 we all got sucker-punched straight but
93:42 it's just a game that no one should want
93:44 to play you know we were all
93:46 self-employed 150 years ago what did you
93:49 dad do he's a blacksmith where's your
93:50 daddy makes you
93:51 what'd your dad do he farmed what did
93:52 your dad do he fix cars everybody worked
93:54 for themselves you know that I do that
93:58 we have to take a place take our car to
93:59 a place to get the oil changed so cars
94:02 have been made so convoluted right they
94:04 want to pat themselves on the back about
94:06 how great a car is min go check out the
94:10 YouTube video on the new Acura NSX car
94:15 oil change there's like seven seven
94:20 spots where the oil comes out you have
94:21 to disassemble the car to change the
94:24 [ __ ] oil ok let's give the
94:26 engineering team a big giant f+ you know
94:30 should all root down to one hole easy to
94:33 access don't say I have to take off a
94:35 plate off the bottom of the car take
94:37 have to open the hatch up and
94:39 disassemble the entire interior of the
94:40 hatch to get to all these little spots
94:42 it's in you're spilling oil all over
94:44 your car I mean it is just god-awful
94:46 can't change your spark plugs anymore
94:49 you know can't change your brakes
94:51 anymore like everything's been made so
94:53 you have to suck the tit of a
94:54 corporation and we're fighting to work
94:56 for these people you kidding me I sit in
95:00 a smoke lounge you know routinely
95:02 especially with a guy that owns a place
95:04 is a good friend of mine and he and I
95:07 have been self-employed for so long that
95:09 we look at each other you know we had
95:10 these conversations like man people
95:12 never been self-employed they just have
95:14 no clue how drunk they are on this
95:17 control apparatus and there are great
95:19 jobs that you can get working for great
95:21 companies don't get me wrong but I think
95:24 the majority of Mart that great I think
95:26 everybody feels it but because we're
95:28 sort of in a Stockholm Syndrome
95:30 situation we convince ourselves that
95:32 it's okay I don't know of course you
95:38 know if you live in a democratically run
95:41 state in the United States of America
95:43 they're working for agenda 21 which is
95:46 to try to increase the taxes and fines
95:49 to be selfish and say fines but the
95:52 taxes and fees you have to pay to be
95:54 self employed to the point where you're
95:57 gonna have to be already rich to start
95:58 your company and boy if you have a bad
96:00 year you're screwed you can't even
96:02 afford to close your corporation
96:05 because you can't afford to file your
96:07 taxes you can't afford to pay off the
96:09 move just to get out of your office
96:11 complex I had to move myself out of my
96:13 game studio myself I had friends come
96:17 and help me move I mean poor my
96:19 girlfriend helped me move you know it
96:20 was it was humbling as you could
96:23 possibly imagine right and because I
96:26 couldn't store all the supplies we had
96:29 accrued over ten years I was eating at a
96:31 BBQ place in Costa Mesa California and I
96:36 didn't know it but the owner was kind of
96:38 a hoarder or the manager and so I just
96:40 casually talking to my said Jeannie you
96:42 have any you know need for a desk how
96:44 about a PC like oh yeah man he bought a
96:48 big-ass truck and I swear to god he must
96:50 have come three times
96:51 I gave him desks that were still in
96:54 boxes man I must have gave him three
96:56 CPUs right because I just couldn't you
97:00 know I probably should have sold mall
97:02 online but I was so exhausted from the
97:04 process I'm gonna like you know spend a
97:07 month's on a computer for 200 bucks you
97:09 know or some stupid thing like that
97:10 plus if I made any money I'd have to
97:13 give it to these you know my old
97:14 partners and stuff like that so we all
97:16 just agreed just dump it man just get
97:17 rid of it cuz I asked everybody you
97:19 wanting this crap because he needed to
97:21 drive down here to come and get it right
97:22 they'd already drove and driven down and
97:24 give it to me for my North office in LA
97:26 as we downsized but you know I lost my
97:29 company because of these bankers you
97:32 know creating all these crazy scandals
97:34 subprime loan scandal killed my company
97:37 killed my clients first then killed my
97:38 company when you've been self-employed
97:42 and when you've become aware of things
97:45 like agenda21 and the thing is I didn't
97:48 learn about agenda twenty one being the
97:50 umbrella project into probably about a
97:53 year ago but I've known about a Jenner
97:55 21 for 15 years I just didn't know how
97:57 comprehensive it was right
97:59 and Rosa Corey was literally the last
98:03 linchpin and the whole thing for me to
98:05 figure it all out and put it all
98:07 together she's utterly brilliant man
98:08 talk about a super high IQ woman who
98:11 talks from the heart she doesn't read
98:13 speeches and she can talk for hours and
98:15 hours and hours and she's an attorney
98:18 man
98:18 so and she's presenting the information
98:20 to you she's presenting it to you like
98:22 an attorney who's about to win a case in
98:24 court so it's kind of like Michael
98:27 Rupert back in the day it was a police
98:29 officer who was presenting his case for
98:33 drug importation by our intelligence
98:36 agencies a lot of stuff about 9/11 and
98:39 he was presenting it as a police officer
98:41 in a court of law with facts yeah god
98:46 bless him he miraculously blew his
98:49 brains out one Sunday night after a
98:51 podcast I would normally think that he
98:54 would have been murdered but he was so
98:56 he would be bought into peak oil he
98:58 bought into a bunch of other things and
99:00 he really thought the world was gonna
99:01 end he did a Vice episode before he died
99:04 where I thought my dad I'm surprised
99:06 he's still on planet earth with as
99:08 negative as he was he was the guy that
99:09 couldn't sleep at night for what he knew
99:11 he didn't find it a benefit he found it
99:13 a negative but he was shot at he was he
99:19 had his office in Canada ransacked and
99:21 all of his property destroyed and he
99:23 just kept running out of money trying to
99:25 restart his operation from the
99:27 wilderness was his old company name you
99:31 know they say that revolutions are won
99:33 with less than 5% of the population it's
99:37 like the Revolutionary War I think the
99:39 amount of soldiers that fought versus
99:42 the amount of citizens here in the
99:43 United States was less than 5% and they
99:46 fought for years and years and years
99:48 from the 1770s all the way up to 1812
99:50 and so you know if you think you're
99:54 insignificant to get educated to make a
99:56 change it's not true if you just part of
100:01 that 5% I think with the internet we
100:04 could definitely eclipse a deep
100:06 double-digit percentage of people
100:08 willing to fight back you know as much
100:11 as this qa9 thing is becoming
100:13 increasingly annoying where you know he
100:16 spends 90% of his time trying to prove
100:18 that he's with Trump and 10% of the time
100:21 fulfilling any prophecy of major you
100:24 know cataclysmic arrests or anything
100:26 right all the people that have caused
100:28 all the headaches in the last 20 years
100:30 are free
100:31 right now and so but they're making all
100:35 kinds of predictions that are pretty
100:38 outrageous right now me today was a Joe
100:40 him pretty much said that Steven
100:43 Spielberg's going down for pedophilia
100:48 okay that's a real big claim in that
100:51 would be earth-shattering for the United
100:53 States of America and I've made so many
100:55 episodes where I use that guy as a
100:57 reference if that ever happens I don't
100:58 know what to do on you a pedophile is a
101:01 hero but um you know you getting
101:06 educated about your own health protect
101:09 yourself I have made dozens and dozens
101:11 episodes that are hopefully really
101:13 helpful for all things from you know
101:16 season one I just looked at the playlist
101:19 because I've been doing hash tag entries
101:23 for my old videos so they get into
101:26 search engine the new algorithm that's
101:28 using hash tags as well but I went back
101:30 to season one in fact sorry went on
101:33 season ones on a different Channel now
101:34 because everything's been remastered so
101:36 go to the deep thoughts radio calm and
101:38 click see one you'll see held in the
101:39 season one videos the websites podcasts
101:43 is all is all the the old original mp3s
101:49 one day I'll update all those but the
101:52 first season is is really me trying to
101:55 give you all of the tricks of the trade
101:56 and the wisdom that I have accrued
101:59 through massive painful scars from doing
102:03 it all wrong or things I learned from
102:05 mentors that kept me from experiencing
102:07 those things so I gave it to you through
102:10 episodes so my hope is that that saves
102:15 you a lot of time you know the cancer
102:18 thing is almost hard to believe but I'm
102:19 telling you man I you know I've had a
102:21 girl who was friend of my girlfriend who
102:24 was in stage four told she had six
102:26 months to live four months later fully
102:28 cured we've had three people in the
102:31 comment sections because I've done the
102:32 cancer episode three times and so the
102:35 new one is the best one so far the
102:37 people in the comments are like I just
102:39 used this technique and all my lymph
102:41 node cancer went away it's three months
102:43 later he's the guy first guy ever
102:45 like that was like this is a miracle I
102:48 don't even know what to say wish I could
102:50 hug you whatever you know it was like oh
102:51 my god that's phenomenal right so the
102:55 stuff works for a lot of people and
102:56 there's other techniques in the videos
102:58 way more intense techniques that are
103:00 easy to do and you can do chemo at the
103:02 same time if you didn't trust it problem
103:05 is if you do chemo kills what 90 97
103:09 percent of people take it and it's just
103:12 that story uh well the cancer got him
103:14 you know so getting educated you know
103:19 like again when you mentioned agenda21
103:22 you need to say look what i'm about to
103:23 tell you is a conspiracy united states
103:25 but it's it's a yearly meeting in the UK
103:28 err sorry in the EU scuse me
103:30 I guess the UK used to be in that
103:32 meeting and you know Britain getting out
103:36 of the EU is profound people you know at
103:43 some point and this is what sort of the
103:45 catch-22 with this whole thing if we
103:49 stop these globalists 100% get rid of
103:52 the EU get back all the unique
103:54 currencies of Europe yeah maybe they
103:57 keep the EE of the Euro around for a
103:59 little while but you need to get back to
104:00 Deutsche Mark and the French franc and
104:01 all that stuff you know get back the
104:05 culture of your country for Christ's
104:07 sake man I don't want to come to Germany
104:08 and eat you know falafels I want to eat
104:11 knockwursts you know and I go to France
104:12 and need a pastry and not some some
104:16 Middle Eastern thing you know it's like
104:18 I don't want to have those restaurants
104:19 there but it's like I want the thousands
104:22 of years of these countries have
104:24 incubated up their culture to still
104:26 exist or I want experience France the
104:29 way that Mark Twain did you know but if
104:33 we kick their asses at the 5% level then
104:38 the 95 percent won't appreciate what
104:40 we've done because the scenario that
104:42 they avoided don't ever know about it
104:44 and so you'll still have these Bernie
104:45 Sanders going out there trying to sell
104:47 socialism because no one got to
104:49 experience it you know all these people
104:51 that would love socialism like Bernie
104:52 Sanders should be forced to live in
104:54 Brazil in an average apartment for one
104:59 he would be screaming for a delta force
105:02 extraction within 15 days guaranteed
105:06 especially at 80 years old when he sees
105:09 children being murdered by children in
105:12 the streets and I just want to put a
105:15 point on that if there's anything I'm
105:17 not exaggerating about it's the deaths
105:19 in Brazil and Argentina and Venezuela
105:23 because it is horrible down there right
105:27 now and they I've seen I don't know
105:31 hundreds enough videos but various
105:33 channels on YouTube are shine at YouTube
105:35 on the Internet where it's there they
105:38 put a lot of funny videos in there but
105:40 they put some of these in there and
105:41 wants one for those creeps that like to
105:43 watch that kind of stuff but I'll watch
105:45 it just to see look is this real this is
105:47 fake whatever and man it is every week I
105:52 have the opportunity of seeing probably
105:54 sinks disgusting videos of people
105:57 murdering young young people murdering
105:58 young people down there I stopped
106:01 watching it because it was like hey it's
106:03 real don't need to say anymore I mean it
106:05 makes the beheadings in the Middle East
106:07 seem like summer camp men so if we do
106:14 beat these folks okay and I encourage
106:17 you to watch these specials from the
106:19 Deutsche Welle vele I don't know say it
106:24 maybe someone in Germany can help me say
106:26 it it's a channel on YouTube just watch
106:29 them all get a sense for yeah they're
106:32 gonna mention global warming again but
106:33 whatever just where can you go not
106:35 listening to that crap we have to then
106:38 go and help these third-world countries
106:41 somehow I don't know how to do it you
106:45 know if we don't export for instance
106:47 like I've printed that with the textile
106:49 companies in Indonesia there's a
106:52 Japanese company named unique there are
106:55 the gap uses textiles from India and
106:58 Indonesia excuse me if you don't buy
107:01 those products and you post on the
107:04 Internet at least I'm not buying your
107:06 products because you're using textiles
107:08 from Indonesia where they don't clean
107:10 their water before they throw it into
107:11 the
107:12 now what is I forgot it's I can't say
107:15 the name but it's it's one of their main
107:16 rivers over there and it's their biggest
107:18 river and it's was known as the cleanest
107:20 river in the world before they started
107:22 doing this you know people are bathing
107:25 in this they're drinking from it same
107:27 thing in Africa if we say look you know
107:31 customs is doing a shitty job protecting
107:34 these electronics from going to Africa
107:36 so these people are down there dying
107:39 trying to recycle this stuff tobacco
107:42 companies are getting kids addicted to
107:45 cigarettes of all things right be a
107:48 little bit different if it was tobacco
107:49 for a cigar you know but then they need
107:51 to give these kids gloves and and if
107:54 they live in the same house where they
107:56 hang the tobacco and you don't do that
107:58 even Cubans and South American folks
108:01 don't live in this same place a lot of
108:04 them wear these gas masks because it's
108:06 so toxic from the ammonia coming off
108:08 these things right but you have to also
108:10 heed the warning of that teacher who
108:11 simply said well you help them I've been
108:15 trying to help my whole life and nothing
108:17 works and it's this discrepancy between
108:20 rich and poor
108:21 sounds like a socialism fix right hmm
108:25 I'm willing to bet if we just curb a
108:27 little bit of our consumption as a human
108:31 being which we probably won't but
108:32 whatever yeah my hope is that we're
108:35 gonna get tired of all this crap that
108:37 the kids the Zoomers are gonna get
108:39 SuperDuper tired which i think is about
108:41 1995 was when the first year starts for
108:44 Zoomers down to or up to excuse me 2015
108:49 it's about 20 year get that they're
108:52 gonna get tired of technology and just
108:53 go yeah yeah you and your stupid
108:56 cellphone games that suck you know I'm
108:58 gonna go out and learn how to pitch a
109:01 baseball or softball or I'm gonna play
109:03 hockey or I'm gonna do a skateboard rail
109:05 or whatever I don't learn how to shred a
109:06 guitar learn to play the drums alright I
109:08 sing I'm actually gonna make my clothes
109:10 yeah I just kind of get back into the
109:13 crunchy world don't know maybe getting
109:18 involved getting educated and spreading
109:20 the information and knowing how to get
109:21 over the hurdles of rejection
109:24 someone saying agenda21 and you go well
109:27 the Bilderberg Group was a conspiracy
109:30 for 50 years until the guy who was the
109:32 CEO in 2004 took a video interview Oh
109:34 now a sudden they exist oh that's how it
109:38 works
109:39 Illuminati oh really that's a word that
109:42 we created we're all crazy people for
109:43 using it well that was the name of a
109:45 book and what
109:46 16:46 or something they wrote a book
109:48 they called himselves that not us right
109:50 so I'm tired of being I'm tired of us
109:55 having to fight patrons but it's just
109:58 the name of the game sorry you know
110:00 anyone who's trying to help humanity
110:02 runs into that but also don't forget to
110:04 live your own life at the same time so
110:07 detox yourself detox your family all
110:09 your loved ones at least if you control
110:11 your kids life you can do that you won't
110:13 be able to get your brother assist your
110:14 mother or father to do it but you know
110:17 what'll be interesting is is you won't
110:19 get sick and they will their constant
110:21 get in the cold you take and see every
110:22 day thousand milligrams minimum I took
110:24 about 2 ounces shits going around right

111:02 hours all right next 50 maybe even next
111:05 100 and then I think it'll start
111:07 organically taking off I don't like
111:09 bright Tian's policy because I think
111:11 it's [ __ ] they claim it's just
111:12 because their platform sucks so bad but
111:14 you know [ __ ] shoots able to enter the
111:16 market with infinite videos so
111:18 everything's on a [ __ ] shoot as of

112:00 because you get the episodes before
112:01 everyone else we finally have some
112:03 patreon subscribers that are nailing the
112:05 videos before they go up so for our
112:07 bottom six months or so I post it you
112:10 know day or two before then three days
112:12 later ZnO views but these people are
112:13 paying for the privilege to see it early
112:15 so now we're finally got some folks
112:17 going in ahead of time so I'm very
112:19 pleased with that now because we have a
112:21 store with shirts in it there's a 20%
112:25 discount coupon in there as well and you
112:28 also get the credits for the rest of
112:29 your life no matter if you just donate
112:30 for a month and walk off you get that
112:32 for a dollar donation how about that
112:34 when you do PayPal you're totally
112:37 anonymous so I don't know who the hell
112:39 you are at that point actually did make
112:42 a virtual currency from the brave
112:45 browser so I don't know if that's a
112:47 result of my running around or one of
112:50 you downloaded that link but it was like
112:52 you know I don't know it's like a
112:53 fraction of a penny or some [ __ ] but the
112:57 outside brave browser I do promote and
112:58 then back please is pretty amazing there
113:02 is a bit of a bug with Backblaze on the
113:04 macintosh at least I've never had this
113:06 issue on the Windows platform but it
113:08 will back up outside of your scheduled
113:11 backup time frame and it really does
113:13 rack your computer processor and your
113:15 hard drives depending on what kind of
113:16 computer you have so if that's an issue
113:19 just know you need to go up there and
113:20 say pause back up or you can switch it
113:22 to the point where you just bump it once
113:24 a day and it'll just go when your button
113:26 you ain't going to sleep you just go hey
113:27 back it up right now but other than that
113:29 is the cheapest platform on planet Earth
113:31 it's like eight bucks or something like
113:33 that for infinite storage or for one
113:36 computer so it's pretty cool I think if
113:40 you pay 10 or 11 you get like a recall
113:43 for like a year which is really cool I
113:45 just saved my butt the other day I am I
113:48 didn't need to back up
113:49 I didn't hadn't lost any files but I
113:51 went to another local
113:52 with my laptop thinking I had something
113:55 in my Dropbox three illustration I was
113:57 doing and I had moved it to out of my
114:01 Dropbox into another Drive so I just
114:03 went up to Backblaze looked in the old
114:05 folder when I just before I moved it
114:07 hadn't changed his since backed up that
114:09 one file I was off the races and
114:11 finished my project that night so very
114:13 cool the store does have two designs
114:16 I've been told my designs have shipped
114:19 to me so I'll be wearing those very
114:21 shortly here I'll make an episode during
114:23 the day just to show off but one's a fun
114:26 one says I like UFOs with the branding
114:27 on the back and the other one just has
114:29 the UFO broke down into like a schematic
114:32 on the front it's based on the Bob Lazar
114:36 sports model UFO he talked about that's
114:39 why it's a sports model on the front
114:40 this is a Morse code in there too it's
114:42 kind of cool but anyway other than the
114:46 season one which is on its own channel
114:48 that's about it on the on the bumper
114:52 anyway until the next episode take care
114:54 of yourself in someone else and I'll see
114:56 you on the next deep thoughts over now
115:01 [Applause]
