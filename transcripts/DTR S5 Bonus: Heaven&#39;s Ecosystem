00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen
00:34 i'm going to tell you man i have tried
00:35 to record this episode tonight
00:37 twice i got an hour into the first
00:40 version of it
00:41 i realized my mic turned off and it's
00:44 because my computer wasn't
00:46 plugged in over there so it was running
00:47 on the battery for a little while and it
00:49 died and i didn't see it happen
00:51 so i did a mic check but didn't realize
00:54 this thing had shut off in the middle of
00:55 it then i redid it
00:57 and it went off again i finally realized
00:58 oh my god even though the computer keeps
01:00 turning on every time i turn to power
01:02 i'm wondering why it was turning off
01:05 so this episode
01:08 comes out of a video that i saw recently
01:12 it really catalyzed my mind
01:15 to take on this video and this is going
01:17 to be about
01:18 the ecosystem of heaven sort of
01:22 based on what we've heard and it's going
01:23 to start with the particular angle of
01:25 angels
01:26 because a friend of mine gave me this
01:27 really interesting video
01:30 where this dude was was basically
01:31 interpreting the bible
01:35 by starting at the beginning and talking
01:37 about all the mentions
01:38 of angels throughout the bible
01:42 and then building up the relationships
01:44 between satan and gabriel and michael
01:46 and just you know and how their
01:49 relationship works with god
01:50 and it was his interpretation of it all
01:53 so right off the bat what i want to say
01:55 is this isn't going to be
01:57 um heavily immersed in
02:01 the bible so we'll leave that completely
02:03 alone as a great book of wisdom off to
02:05 the side and
02:06 you keep your beautiful interpretation
02:09 of that
02:10 if that's your paradigm of worship
02:14 and we're just going to talk about one
02:17 from the biblical standpoint
02:20 it's assertions of what heaven might be
02:22 like
02:23 but then we're going to sort of fan out
02:25 to
02:26 more of a just logistical observation
02:30 of what this
02:34 type of world would be because a lot of
02:37 times we
02:38 view things in a very weird box right we
02:41 don't really think about heaven until we
02:42 think about our own death or we
02:44 experience someone else's death and then
02:46 all of a sudden heaven exists in our
02:47 mind
02:48 and the realm is that it exists
02:52 and probably has existed forever if it
02:55 ever
02:56 did exist i mean the universe i think is
02:58 again an is
02:59 right it's always been we don't
03:01 understand that because
03:03 we have a beginning middle and end so we
03:04 tend to invent bogus theories like
03:06 big bang which immediately has problems
03:09 which is then we have dark matter to
03:10 button up the bad theory and it just
03:12 keeps falling apart you know
03:14 but the big kind of touch
03:18 point to really enter this conversation
03:20 is the relationship between
03:22 this
03:26 satan character being an archangel of
03:28 god at one point being good
03:30 and being at the right hand of god at
03:32 one point even if you're not religious
03:34 this will
03:35 equip you to have the conversation to
03:38 essentially cancel out
03:39 a lot of the made-up stuff that we've
03:43 created to deal with the fact that we
03:44 don't know
03:47 i do want to mention that the folks that
03:49 tend to have after life
03:51 or you know near-death experiences where
03:53 they die they flood away from their body
03:54 they go somewhere
03:56 and they come back until the youtube
04:00 invention i couldn't find a single
04:02 person that ever saw
04:03 said they saw a christian god on the
04:06 other side or anybody
04:07 who matched their religion they always
04:09 have very unique experiences
04:13 you know like the little girl that died
04:14 at uh eight years old in a car accident
04:16 in 1954
04:17 she saw a westworld world that was
04:20 documented
04:21 after she came back she described what
04:23 she saw
04:24 it's like westworld it was a bunch of
04:26 offices with glass partitions
04:29 people on what she thought were like
04:31 computers with flat keyboards that were
04:33 backlit flat monitors i mean come on
04:35 stuff didn't exist in the paradigm of
04:37 thought in the
04:39 50s among the most brilliant people let
04:41 alone an eight-year-old child
04:45 i told you guys a long time ago about
04:46 the story um
04:49 in a two-week period i heard two
04:51 different guys who don't know each other
04:52 at all
04:54 had had accidents i think one was a
04:57 motorcycle accident
04:58 might have been a car accident they both
05:00 floated away from their bodies and both
05:01 described exactly the same thing
05:04 as soon as they left their bodies all
05:05 the pain left their body
05:07 they went to a beautiful place i forgot
05:09 what their individual stories were
05:11 but they had no pain they saw the most
05:13 beautiful place they felt
05:15 extra wonderful let alone no pain
05:18 and then when they were forced to come
05:19 back down in their bodies they were not
05:21 happy
05:22 because they wanted to stay it was
05:24 fantastic and then they got back in
05:25 their broken bodies and they had to heal
05:27 you know
05:29 you know the story of satan being an
05:31 archangel for an instant is
05:33 it pulls out a lot more than just that
05:35 story which is why i think this will be
05:37 interesting to you even if you don't
05:38 believe in any of that stuff
05:41 but the story goes is that god comes
05:44 into existence somehow or always is in
05:46 existence
05:47 and i am personally not familiar with
05:50 any story that claims that satan was
05:52 created
05:53 at the same exact time as sort of an
05:55 anti-god
05:57 which would suggest an equal level of
06:00 anti-power
06:02 because if those two were created at the
06:04 same time then you would have
06:07 an actual real creator over them
06:11 that we'd have to acknowledge if we were
06:13 worshiping
06:14 the creator it wouldn't be god and it
06:16 wouldn't be satan because someone
06:17 created them
06:19 the way i've always heard the story is
06:20 that however god decided to create
06:23 anything
06:24 satan comes after him as a result of his
06:28 ingenuity and so he creates this
06:31 being which i guess wasn't perfect
06:35 very interesting god is not supposed to
06:37 be able to be in the presence of
06:38 something that's un
06:39 imperfect but if satan truly dropped out
06:42 of his
06:43 archangel status then he was never
06:45 perfect to begin with
06:47 and therefore could not have existed
06:50 with god
06:52 unless there's a cataclysmic event in
06:54 which he is changed
06:56 and he becomes dark we're gonna get to
06:58 that too
07:00 but to back up just before we start
07:03 there's an interesting test you can do
07:05 and it's fascinating because it's almost
07:07 100 conclusive
07:11 i in my early 40s started asking my
07:14 friends who were religious
07:15 to describe well first i ask them do you
07:18 believe in heaven
07:19 and almost everybody says yes no matter
07:21 what their definition is
07:22 and when i ask them to describe it they
07:25 got nothing
07:27 well it's just great it's gonna be great
07:31 okay now again the buddhists
07:36 over thousands of years figured out that
07:39 any single
07:41 state of existence without change would
07:44 become a hell
07:46 nirvana is both heaven and hell
07:51 so i always you know caution anyone who
07:54 tries to say that heaven is going to be
07:56 this one state of total euphoria
07:58 you know you got the cocaine that
08:00 doesn't cause you any problems you know
08:02 whatever it is you're doing is just
08:04 amazing constantly constantly constantly
08:08 because you will become the cue in star
08:09 trek when you want to commit suicide you
08:11 know
08:12 you've done everything an infinite
08:14 number of times it's time to end
08:16 which is why purely and 100 believe in
08:20 reincarnation with some perhaps you know
08:24 different things in the mezzanine you
08:26 know walt disney's at
08:27 disneyland i'll tell you that much
08:31 you know the way that i popularized it
08:33 before i created the show in my mind was
08:34 to think that okay i
08:36 i'm a human being for a finite number of
08:38 years i develop all these different
08:41 i wish i had done these things
08:44 and i always think of like heaven is a
08:47 green room
08:48 i mean i'm telling you that feeling
08:50 going through my soul feels so
08:52 true you can stay as long as you want
08:55 you can get all your little
08:57 fantasies you created as a human being
08:59 if you still feel like they're relevant
09:01 to your being after you do this big
09:02 transition out of your body
09:04 unless you're mormon and somehow you
09:06 keep your body what's interesting is
09:08 mormons know that your body doesn't
09:10 travel with you because they sit there
09:11 and look at you after you're dead
09:12 and you rot they put you in a casket
09:15 they bury in the ground still
09:17 so at some point in the mormon religion
09:19 you get a body given to you maybe that
09:21 happens who knows
09:22 just to make it a little easier on your
09:23 mind on your soul
09:27 i don't know how you would do anything
09:29 like for instance let's say
09:31 you your father was a big
09:34 fan of elvis and your father passes and
09:37 you're thinking okay
09:38 he's up there with elvis now okay well
09:41 zelda still up there
09:42 don't know i mean my god think of the
09:44 overtime for that guy he would have to
09:46 put in to give every single fan
09:48 he's ever had a personal experience
09:53 so i don't know maybe it's all simulated
09:56 if it's a big matrix who knows
09:59 but getting back to the biblical sort of
10:02 assertions about a satan being this
10:07 i guess a perfect being right because
10:10 think about it there would be this
10:12 beginning
10:14 maybe it seems like earth has a
10:16 beginning
10:17 if there's a bunch of earths they all
10:18 have beginnings and little soul
10:22 you know clusters
10:25 bind with flesh in the womb
10:29 and give it a chance to live right as
10:31 soon as the heartbeat starts going
10:34 brain stem comes together seems like our
10:37 souls attach to the brainstem somehow
10:42 as soon as that occurs you get life and
10:44 then you start having a very subjective
10:47 experience because at our realm
10:50 we have choices we can do bad things and
10:52 we can do good things what's the
10:54 definition
10:55 well we can destroy good things and we
10:57 can create good things
10:59 you know but if you go all the way up to
11:02 heaven
11:04 well satan anyone up there in general
11:07 gabriel
11:08 none of them have to have any faith
11:10 right because god's right there
11:12 again the disciples had zero faith they
11:16 were on level zero in terms of the
11:17 christian religion and having to keep it
11:19 going why because they met the son of
11:20 god
11:21 he's doing miracles in front of them
11:24 bringing people back to life
11:25 casting demons into pigs and drowning
11:28 them i mean
11:29 stays you know st uh steadying the
11:33 mediterranean sea in the middle of a
11:34 storm
11:36 water into wine you know i mean the
11:38 whole thing
11:40 zero faith now if you had some guy do
11:44 that to you
11:44 in 2020 right in front of your face and
11:47 he says you need to give up
11:48 everything that you own and follow me
11:52 would you have any questions so many
11:54 people deny christ
11:56 in the story following him after he
11:58 proved to them
11:59 who he was bizarre
12:02 i'm assuming the dude had an aura that
12:04 was pretty uh
12:06 pretty profound right but we're not in
12:09 that realm yet we're up in heaven
12:11 christ hasn't even created yet but way
12:13 back at the
12:14 zero hour of anything existing in
12:17 addition to god
12:20 but the interesting thing is that people
12:21 will say this just
12:23 nonchalantly right well satan fell away
12:26 from god he
12:28 he got greedy right he got a big flaw
12:30 inside of himself
12:32 it just miraculously created itself
12:34 wasn't god's intervention god didn't
12:36 make him
12:37 imperfect how could god do such a thing
12:39 god can't have imperfect things around
12:41 him so how could he possibly
12:43 wick it out of his hands
12:47 he always think that you know bad people
12:49 in in the world are just a
12:52 coincidence of how mass and energy goes
12:54 together and you have a bad dad or mom
12:56 or
12:57 whatever you got a roth child as a
12:59 father
13:00 and you're gonna become a piece of [ __ ]
13:02 okay
13:04 but if you're up there with god how does
13:07 that even occur
13:09 you would think if you were to write the
13:10 story and
13:12 and take it into hollywood it would be
13:15 you know let's say this story never
13:16 happened we don't have any faith of any
13:18 kind we don't need stories about this
13:20 and i take that little premise into a
13:22 studio
13:22 and i say hey uh got a great movie for
13:25 you what is it well there's this guy he
13:26 created the whole universe oh that's
13:27 interesting
13:28 and he's got the sidekick and he's
13:31 perfect and he's at the right hand of
13:33 god
13:35 he was created by this supreme being
13:39 and then there's this chain of events
13:41 that occurs
13:42 and he falls away from god
13:46 the studio head's gonna look at me going
13:48 right but i don't okay so
13:49 how did that even happen right didn't
13:51 you see this guy guy can't be around
13:53 flawed things and you just told me the
13:54 guy's flawed how does that even work
13:56 you have a logic problem right the very
13:58 beginning of your premise once you go
13:59 off learn how to write
14:00 a premise see later story wouldn't go
14:02 anywhere because it makes no sense
14:05 and yet yet this is the belief for some
14:07 people
14:09 well the other thing was that satan got
14:11 replaced
14:13 and then satan has some buddies like
14:15 gabriel who's not technically an
14:17 archangel
14:18 he's an angel but what's interesting
14:20 about it to me
14:21 is that we have these really funny
14:24 folklore
14:25 cartoony visions of heaven right it's
14:27 got walls
14:28 so god built a border remember that he's
14:30 got a gate up front
14:32 peter got screwed with the worst job
14:33 ever he has to check
14:35 everybody into heaven he's got this book
14:37 it's like an
14:38 infinite page book i guess and you're
14:41 standing there
14:42 they don't you know you get taken to
14:44 heaven just to tease you man you get
14:45 taken to heaven and then
14:46 someone sometimes you know you gotta go
14:47 get that bus over there you're not gonna
14:49 make it
14:51 but let's say you get in the door who
14:54 knows what happens right
14:56 and then angels kind of give you the
15:00 sense that there's a job program in
15:02 heaven
15:02 right we're going to come in you're
15:04 going to do all your hey i've never done
15:05 this before
15:06 oh i can do this now and let's just eat
15:09 eat forever let's do whatever we want to
15:12 do and then
15:13 you know within the rules i guess you're
15:14 going to lose a lot of your loves from
15:16 earth
15:16 which should be very interesting and
15:18 then if you
15:19 check into this this job you know
15:22 becoming an angel you don't have to but
15:23 you can go do that if you want to
15:25 they probably send you down like all
15:27 those funny twilight zones where they
15:28 sing you down to earth and you gotta
15:30 help somebody out
15:31 there's a caribou net uh her episode
15:33 she's being helped by a
15:35 guardian angel she didn't want to have
15:37 anything to do with anything he was
15:38 giving her
15:40 but if he does it right you come up and
15:42 you get your wings as soon as you get
15:43 your wings you're a full-fledged angel
15:46 and i guess you just rinse and repeat
15:48 but now you're more trusted your pay
15:50 grade goes up right
15:53 well the interesting thing about a right
15:55 hand of god it would be sort of the
15:56 chronology that's never explained did
15:58 god create the entire universe
16:01 and all the souls that are going to be
16:03 kind of
16:04 recycling through all these bodies he's
16:06 also created
16:08 and then he creates some minions to the
16:10 side like he needs help
16:12 the whole idea that god needs help is
16:14 just sort of funny
16:16 god is always very man-made never forget
16:18 that
16:19 his anger arcs are always very man-made
16:22 what god gets angry at is something
16:23 silly that man would get angry at
16:25 but not something god would get angry at
16:28 an infinitely intelligent creature
16:30 could never be angry there is no
16:34 disciplinary or i should actually
16:37 discipline is actually necessary but
16:39 you know losing your cool raising your
16:41 voice
16:43 i described it to my friend the other
16:44 day i said you know if you ever have a
16:46 child
16:48 and your kid does something that you
16:50 know playing with the power outlet and a
16:51 fork
16:52 you know you need to making a very
16:54 intense impression on your kid depending
16:56 on their
16:57 re repetition of doing such things the
17:00 first time you go oh don't do that you
17:02 get yourself hurt and they may not
17:03 believe you
17:04 they may go right back to putting it
17:06 back in there and shock themselves right
17:08 so they go back in again now you got to
17:10 raise your voice and maybe have to swat
17:12 the diaper right
17:13 it's not a painful thing it's a
17:14 disciplinary thing it's a rejection for
17:16 a split second then you give them a big
17:17 hug
17:18 make sure they understand you still love
17:20 them you're just looking out for them
17:22 but if you ask the parent who has to
17:24 give any level of discipline were you
17:26 angry when you did the discipline we
17:29 angry at your child yeah
17:32 it happens trust me but first few times
17:35 you're really not angry you're really
17:37 if anything you're disappointed that you
17:38 have to do this right this is the
17:40 process
17:41 you might lose a little fame with your
17:42 child
17:43 [Music]
17:44 but if you ask the child was your father
17:46 or mother angry when they were
17:48 disciplining you
17:49 yeah usually 99 of the time it's gonna
17:52 be yeah they were gonna kill me you know
17:54 that's the funny thing kids say my dad's
17:55 gonna kill me my mom's gonna kill me
17:58 uh well in very rare cases that's
18:01 probably true but in most cases
18:03 no so in that particular
18:06 instance god might be perceived as being
18:08 men but he's not really mad he's just
18:10 doing what needs to be done
18:12 to correct mankind and to maturing
18:15 into what will be more productive
18:22 but when you're in heaven i don't know
18:25 if you have
18:26 choice it's either good good good or
18:29 good
18:29 what do you want to do today ah good all
18:32 right
18:33 hey what flavor of good do you want
18:35 chocolate
18:36 red or the sound of a trumpet you know
18:40 whatever it is you want to do okay
18:44 and it's interesting how human beings we
18:46 have
18:48 this love for choice how many times you
18:51 walked up to a
18:52 vending machine that's got so many
18:54 choices you have
18:56 all the money in the pot in your pocket
18:57 to pay for whatever is in that machine
18:59 you're like oh my god this is great
19:01 it's bad for me i know but i'm gonna
19:03 i've committed to being
19:04 bad today to eating candy but let's just
19:08 see
19:08 it's great you go to a restaurant a nice
19:10 restaurant they have more than one
19:11 entree
19:11 isn't that nice choice
19:15 because we have preferences we develop
19:18 preferences over time
19:20 okay i've said you guys several times
19:23 the greatest gift that god ever gave man
19:25 was choice between good
19:27 and bad but if you think about it
19:32 before man ever existed if satan existed
19:35 before man
19:36 then saint only knows the paradigm of
19:38 good
19:40 and if god is going to create something
19:42 brilliant such as choice between good
19:44 and bad then he has to explain it
19:47 to satan well i'm gonna i'm putting out
19:51 2.0 the software
19:53 what's that what's the new feature well
19:56 sit down i'm going to explain something
19:57 to you
19:58 and then you might even explain it 100
20:01 to someone and they're going to be like
20:03 one of two things what does that mean or
20:06 why would you ever do that
20:07 you mean they're going to die didn't you
20:10 say what's pain you know and the guy
20:11 goes
20:12 and you know it's just like mcp and
20:14 stark he's like
20:16 taking down his power cycles and all of
20:19 a sudden seems like oh man that's
20:20 horrible
20:21 yeah that's what i'm gonna give all my
20:23 children is this super duper pain thing
20:26 okay why would you do that well i know
20:30 it sounds crazy but
20:32 it will give them the sense of reward
20:34 when they avoid it
20:36 they have to have motivation you have to
20:38 have a built-in
20:40 genetic track of attraction towards
20:43 something if a contest isn't hard
20:48 then it's not very rewarding in the end
20:52 now there's a great x minus one episode
20:54 and for those of you who have never seen
20:55 my show before
20:57 x minus one was an old radio show from
20:59 58 i believe to 60.
21:02 prior to that there was a show called
21:03 2000 plus these were sci-fi
21:06 writers and we're talking about for x
21:08 minus one you know
21:09 azimuth wrote an episode ray bradbury
21:12 um philip k dick heinlein i mean
21:16 the the geniuses of sci-fi writing
21:19 but a lot of them were funny and there's
21:22 a funny one
21:23 where there was an off-road colony that
21:25 had made managed to make a pretty
21:26 utopian existence
21:28 everyone got along no crime
21:32 but the episode starts off with the
21:33 president having a meeting and he's
21:35 talking about some delegates from earth
21:37 coming to their colony
21:38 and he wants to make a good impression
21:39 on the earthlings
21:41 they're all human so he says the only
21:45 guys i need to talk to you
21:46 after this meeting he says okay so after
21:49 the meeting he says okay here's what i
21:50 need you to do it's gonna keep you gotta
21:51 keep the secret but you gotta do it
21:54 he said sure what what do you mean he
21:55 goes well you're gonna have to kill
21:56 somebody as soon as the earth people
21:58 arrive he's like what he said yeah you
22:01 gotta kill people because on earth
22:03 they have what's called crimes and they
22:04 have a police force and they find the
22:06 criminal and they
22:08 catch him and they go through this
22:09 justice process and we want to show
22:10 earth that we're sophisticated like them
22:12 so we have to have crimes
22:15 and the dude's like you know resisting
22:16 he's like i want to kill anybody who am
22:18 i supposed to kill well
22:19 you'll find out he gives i think they
22:22 have like a debate about who to kill
22:24 it's just
22:24 kind of hilarious and then he doesn't
22:26 have to do it think about that
22:29 in this fictitious radio show they
22:32 developed a planet that doesn't know
22:33 anything about death
22:34 and murder and horrible things
22:38 but into him but to impress earth
22:41 he tries to do it the reason why
22:46 i think the angel thing is interesting
22:48 is that outside of the angels stories
22:51 of heaven we have nothing
22:55 we really have nothing besides the gates
22:58 the pearly gates the big book
23:00 you got nothing as soon as it goes
23:02 inside it's like your brain shuts off
23:06 i think i created an episode that was
23:07 like threshold of belief and it
23:09 really talked about the fact that for
23:10 scientists when they try to conceive of
23:13 space outer space there's this almost
23:16 genetic
23:17 resistance to us being able to process a
23:19 thought it's sort of like if i said okay
23:22 i want you to think of every number that
23:23 exists right now go
23:25 every divisible fractional number every
23:28 exponential
23:29 giant number think about it all the same
23:31 once you get all the numbers that exist
23:33 in your brain
23:34 well your your brain short circuits like
23:36 robbie the robot
23:37 in a forbidden planet
23:41 you just start short-circuiting because
23:42 you can't do it and sort of like that
23:44 with these paradigms of heaven
23:46 unless you can create an ecosystem that
23:48 makes sense to you
23:52 now let's say that when you die you're
23:54 worried about all these sins that these
23:57 these paradigms of religion teach you
24:00 my interpretation is this
24:04 it's not necessarily any individual
24:06 thing that we do here on earth
24:09 because you know i believe we're very
24:12 symbiotic we have a soul we have a body
24:15 between the two you create consciousness
24:16 in the mind
24:18 which is what gurus always tell you
24:19 you're not your body and you're not your
24:21 mind
24:22 you're a soul and why the deepest
24:26 thinkers always come up with this
24:27 conclusion and you're
24:29 sort of phoning in scientists uh your
24:32 atheists and
24:33 many cases they just don't want to think
24:36 about the infinite number sets they just
24:38 cut it off i i don't believe in this
24:39 because and that prefer
24:41 that prevents me from ever needing to
24:43 think about something that's
24:45 ambiguous unknown which is why we
24:48 believe in so many things that don't
24:50 have any evidence behind them it's what
24:54 we do
24:55 it's just how we deal with being cowards
24:58 of intellectual thought but
25:01 for me it goes something like this
25:04 as soon as we pass away we're leaving
25:07 our world behind
25:09 we're leaving our body behind we're
25:12 leaving behind
25:13 all of the loved ones that are still
25:14 alive now they may end up joining us
25:16 later
25:17 okay not negating any of that and we may
25:20 be immediately joined by those that have
25:21 already passed
25:23 there's a lot of people working hospice
25:25 who
25:26 have witnessed this several times
25:30 but i think what ends up happening is
25:31 you get a grand total
25:34 of the spreadsheet of your life you have
25:36 two columns
25:37 good and bad things that you
25:40 knew you shouldn't have done but you
25:42 actually used your calorie energy
25:44 to do those bad things
25:48 and so it's just a sum toe a percentage
25:50 of both
25:52 i'm often telling you that i am
25:53 motivated
25:55 because i do believe that regardless of
25:57 what heaven might be
25:58 regardless of reincarnation even exists
26:02 i do believe i will stand before in a
26:05 metaphorical way
26:07 the creator a dmt
26:10 trip and you just turn into light boom
26:12 you're headed to
26:13 wherever this place is
26:18 and i don't want to create
26:21 more things that i'm going to be
26:23 embarrassed about
26:25 in my life so i try to live it as clean
26:27 as possible
26:28 to great sacrifice of money i could make
26:32 if i were willing to go the other way
26:36 i don't think money is evil i just think
26:37 there's a lot of ways to make it really
26:39 fast
26:40 that are very negative right
26:43 so because it's pretty evident to me i'm
26:45 not going to have my body
26:47 i don't know if i'm going to know my
26:48 name one second
26:50 after i die maybe i don't
26:55 so what would be the point of me going
26:58 up there with my fantasies from earth
27:00 that never got fulfilled
27:02 perhaps those will never be fulfilled
27:05 until i come back down again but of
27:07 course if i wanted to meet
27:09 prince if he's not there when i'm there
27:12 i may never meet the dude
27:14 ever sort of a burden to him
27:17 he's got you know probably a billion
27:19 fans and it's a long afterlife right
27:23 but getting back to this fall of satan
27:26 because it's interesting to me if you
27:29 were a perfect being and god is not
27:30 telling you to
27:31 to change then becoming evil would be
27:36 very difficult
27:38 now on earth we have something called
27:39 the rite of passage
27:41 it's a genetic trigger that happens in
27:42 every single one of us
27:44 where we reject the nearest level of
27:47 authority over us
27:48 that matches the role that we would play
27:52 so usually a daughter goes against your
27:54 mother usually a son goes against his
27:56 father
27:58 because in the gorilla world we can see
28:00 it happen you know you have to knock the
28:02 old man out if you ever want to
28:04 have sex and have kids the old man's
28:07 still around
28:09 but you're going to take over eventually
28:10 the more sons that he has the more
28:12 pain the ass he's got going but if one
28:14 son knocks him out the rest of them can
28:16 knock out the other son
28:18 at least he finds some peace
28:21 i watched a series of
28:24 videos on youtube and you guys have
28:25 probably seen these as well seen these
28:27 as well
28:28 there is a group out there that puts a
28:30 gigantic
28:31 mirror in the jungle it's a huge mirror
28:34 it's like 10 feet tall
28:36 probably like 15 feet wide and i don't
28:39 know what it's made out of but it's
28:40 durable man it's like a mirror
28:42 made of a really amazing metal because
28:46 it can't break
28:47 because boy hit this thing sometimes
28:49 you'll have
28:50 a leopard combined he'll lick the thing
28:52 totally gross all the way over it's just
28:54 wild what happens right
28:56 there's elephants they get freaked out
28:58 about it trying to rush the mirror and
29:00 they always stop before they hit it but
29:02 the gorillas are amazing and the
29:04 chimpanzees are amazing
29:06 gorillas are a little bit easier to
29:08 figure out like who's
29:09 who's who and what's what
29:13 it's funny when you watch gorillas
29:14 you'll find them of different sizes of
29:16 course the females are usually smaller
29:17 than the males
29:18 but once that silverback comes around
29:21 he's like godzilla he's a gigantor
29:23 right but when you see the old man
29:26 you'll see the old man gorilla
29:28 who used to be the dude in charge it's
29:30 really interesting
29:33 so my question about this whole rite of
29:34 passage thing is to say okay did satan
29:37 have a right of passage
29:38 where he says his trigger that god put
29:40 in him the funny thing is that god would
29:42 have been responsible for creating
29:43 everything
29:46 so we as human beings
29:50 like to say that satan does things in
29:52 god that are bad and god
29:54 never does anything that's bad satan is
29:56 god's
29:57 arch enemy at this point okay
30:01 who created satan you have to say god
30:05 if you you have to say god no matter
30:07 what because if the god that
30:09 that was having him at the right hand
30:13 was created by something else then
30:14 you're really worshiping the one above
30:16 and so that one above created
30:18 satan no matter what sounds like a bit
30:21 like
30:21 who's on first right it's hard to
30:25 imagine
30:27 that everything is so organized on the
30:29 other realm because what's this realm
30:31 doing
30:33 isn't there an old saying as it is above
30:35 so too is it below
30:37 that's a little freaky in science it's
30:38 great
30:40 but in terms of the way we interact on
30:42 this plane of existence oh my god
30:45 this place is run by a bunch of freaking
30:47 satanists right
30:48 it is we technically know this is true
30:51 now
30:51 right they believe in a satan whether he
30:55 ever exists existed or exists or
30:57 whatever
31:00 i think it was interesting and then um
31:01 you know i'm a big fan of sammy davis jr
31:03 as i got older and started seeing his
31:05 performances and just
31:07 who he portrayed himself and to us as a
31:10 persona
31:12 and then i had seen a documentary god 20
31:14 years ago
31:15 said he was into satanism in the 70s
31:17 when he was aging and he was not being
31:19 as
31:21 booked as he used to be the rat pack had
31:23 blown up
31:25 and i rejected it in my mind i said no
31:27 it's probably some propaganda to take a
31:29 piss on a black guy
31:30 who had really had a rough time
31:34 pushing through all the racism to get in
31:35 his career and then i saw just recently
31:37 as i mentioned in an episode not too
31:38 long ago
31:39 eddie murphy's writing with seinfeld in
31:41 a car and he says he met
31:43 sammy davis jr and he told
31:46 seinfeld that he did that sammy davis
31:49 said to him
31:50 well satan is just as powerful as god
31:56 and you saw the face on eddie murphy
31:58 he's just kind of looking around he's
31:59 like as the car's going and he's like
32:01 what the hell is he talking about i just
32:03 want to come over and say hi
32:05 you know so i mean in one realm there's
32:08 a recruitment phase going on
32:09 for sammy someone recruited him
32:14 but what if the other realm
32:17 is just as chaotic as this one
32:21 now if we were to take all of the
32:23 near-death experiences
32:25 at face value again
32:29 i don't hear anyone mentioning jesus
32:31 christ meeting them on the other side
32:33 or allah or anyone that they believed in
32:36 on earth except for one satanist
32:38 guy in new york i don't even remember
32:40 what kind of experience he was having
32:43 but he had a he was an attention getter
32:47 you know satanist guy and then he
32:50 went to hell in some vision and he said
32:52 jesus was there and said you know you
32:54 want to stay here and come with me and
32:55 he
32:55 turned his soul around and came back and
32:57 now he's converted right
32:59 but other than that one guy when random
33:01 people die
33:03 and then go somewhere and then come back
33:05 into their body
33:06 there's just there's an archetype of the
33:08 story that's phenomenal
33:11 they float over their bodies they see
33:13 their bodies they have no pain they go
33:15 to a wonderful place sometimes they meet
33:16 a relative sometimes you meet a random
33:18 character up there that says i'm sorry
33:20 you gotta go back down
33:23 they don't say oh i was in
33:26 virtually no pain i got knocked out
33:28 because i was killed and then i went up
33:30 and
33:32 immediately it was on fire and then i
33:34 came back down i was so glad not to be
33:36 on fire anymore it's like you never hear
33:37 that story
33:38 i haven't heard that story so
33:42 there's some indicators that maybe that
33:44 realm is a wonderful realm
33:46 my belief in reincarnation as it relates
33:49 to this ecosystem
33:50 is that there's a lot of work going and
33:52 a lot of work that went into this world
33:54 that goes
33:54 into this world every single split
33:56 second right and so to come back down
33:58 and do it again
34:00 it's sort of like walt disney builds
34:02 disney
34:03 land and he you know he makes some
34:06 really cool rides and you want to write
34:07 it again
34:08 and then walt goes no he could only
34:10 write everything one time
34:12 in fact you can only ride one ride one
34:13 time what kind of
34:15 sense does that make i'm pretty sure god
34:18 be like yeah sure you're supposed to go
34:19 back down
34:20 but you can stay here as long as you
34:21 want there's no rules maybe being of
34:24 light
34:24 whatever you want to do but now as human
34:28 beings
34:29 we definitely know evil we know it
34:33 it comes in every flavor of everything
34:35 that could possibly happen to you
34:38 when i talked about the black apple
34:40 thing in my black apple episode
34:44 there was a um a lot of people got it i
34:48 mean in the comments some people
34:49 really got the the tool that you can use
34:52 from this point forward to control
34:54 any negative emotions you're having
34:57 because without mentors without a
34:59 perfect
35:00 life you do get cynical and and you get
35:03 uh to the point you don't really trust
35:05 that things are gonna be right it was
35:07 funny a
35:08 friend of mine was saying or interesting
35:10 i should say a friend of mine was
35:11 talking about talking to one of their
35:12 friends and
35:14 i guess the guy was saying you know i've
35:15 got major abandonment issues and
35:18 then she passed it to me and i just said
35:20 well join the club man like
35:21 everybody does you know why because
35:24 everybody dies
35:26 there's always a level of abandonment
35:27 your parents can't be with you 24 7
35:30 take care of your life at some point you
35:32 have to nut up and become a man or a
35:34 woman or whatever it is right
35:36 so there's million slices instead of
35:38 using that as a crutch
35:40 for the reason why you can't get your
35:41 life together you need to just go oh
35:43 yeah it's just a stage of life
35:45 and it goes away after a while because
35:47 you become self-sustained
35:50 a lot of people think that um
35:53 if you do come back that there is a goal
35:56 that we're trying to reach right some
35:58 fully enlightened goal of existence and
36:01 maybe if that's true the only way that
36:04 makes sense to me
36:05 because again we would eventually reach
36:07 the nirvana state of the hell
36:08 right you're up here forever nothing's
36:11 gonna change
36:12 you can only pick good the entire time
36:14 you're here otherwise you'll get cast
36:16 away
36:16 you can't even pick bad there's not
36:18 there's not a bad to choose from in the
36:20 cartoony you know heaven with the
36:23 borders and the gate
36:25 but perhaps as there is infinite numbers
36:28 perhaps there's infinite forms of life
36:32 you know man's hubris suggests that
36:35 humanity is the only thing that exists
36:38 and you can't be anything else
36:40 oh sure you could envision being a bear
36:42 and a spider and that kind of stuff but
36:44 i would assume i'm hoping that we've
36:48 already been those
36:49 if you're human now you've already been
36:50 all those other things right that's why
36:52 some people kind of
36:53 they love cats and they act like cats
36:55 they love dogs and they act like dogs
36:58 you can only really date a dog lover and
37:00 just put that away
37:02 if they were recently a cat because cats
37:04 are all autonomous man
37:05 they're just like get away from me give
37:07 me the food give me the food okay go
37:08 away go away
37:09 no i'm gonna eat don't watch me eat you
37:11 know
37:13 but maybe there's a lot of other forms
37:14 of life above us
37:16 different flavors of humanoid type
37:18 beings
37:20 but the black apple thing is
37:23 the just to summarize it for in case
37:25 you're interested in this episode
37:27 was i started to delineate my own
37:30 consciousness about sort of the
37:32 physical location of where thoughts come
37:35 from
37:36 because the thought is merely a thing in
37:39 your mind
37:40 right it's a gestalt of understanding in
37:43 your head whether it be true or false is
37:45 completely
37:46 subjective at any one point in time but
37:48 if i ask you if you love someone that
37:50 you love
37:52 you can develop that feeling in your
37:54 heart
37:55 in your chest and it will flow up and
37:57 become words and poof
37:59 you tell me that you indeed love a
38:02 person and i know that's a true
38:03 statement
38:04 from you however
38:07 if you have idle hands an idle moment
38:10 and you're not filling it with some
38:12 thought you're just not meditating away
38:14 thoughts you're sitting there just mind
38:17 your own business perhaps you're putting
38:19 your head down your pillow at night
38:22 there's a projector that can project it
38:25 to you
38:26 from the outside suspicion all kinds of
38:30 weird thoughts
38:31 and it uses every single thing about you
38:34 because it knows
38:35 everything about you
38:38 and so it can twist and turn and make
38:40 you suspicious
38:42 now i've had and i don't know if i'm
38:44 manifesting this
38:46 for my own powers to control the
38:47 universe i've definitely had you know
38:49 situations where my girlfriend's not
38:52 where she said she was
38:53 she's doing something she shouldn't and
38:55 like i had suspicion
38:56 things just weren't calculating right
38:58 and i drove to her house and she wasn't
38:59 there
39:00 she said she was there second ago on the
39:01 telephone so i've had those moments
39:04 happen
39:05 i hate doing that because it's kind of
39:06 weird behavior but it just
39:09 it was like almost a scientific
39:10 experiment am i really feeling something
39:12 real and i was like oh my god
39:14 this is the confirmation of my abilities
39:16 i do not want you know
39:18 but there was a great movie that was
39:20 released about 45 days before star wars
39:22 released
39:24 1977 by an animator named ralph
39:27 bakshi he created this amazing movie
39:30 called wizards
39:33 and in this movie you do have two
39:35 brothers born at the same exact time
39:38 one is good one is bad the one that's
39:40 good looks like rough backstreet a
39:41 little kind of jewish rabbi
39:43 wizard guy hilarious dude
39:46 totally hip and he's got this evil
39:49 brother who's sort of your anglo-saxon
39:51 uh
39:52 german tall brother who's got like
39:55 forearms they don't have any flesh on
39:56 him so you see his bones and stuff he's
39:58 kind of like this creepy guy
40:01 a little wizard guy he's kind of mind of
40:03 his own business
40:04 he's got this sexy um fairy he's
40:08 trying to get in bed with
40:12 and his brother he doesn't have anything
40:14 to do with him but his brother is waging
40:16 war
40:16 on all these elves
40:20 and dwarfs and all kinds of stuff right
40:23 what he does is he resurrects a bunch of
40:25 footage
40:26 from the third reich
40:30 and during a war initially his forces
40:33 got killed they're all demons
40:35 and they easily killed so by the second
40:37 battle
40:38 the elves are really over confident with
40:41 their capabilities and so here they are
40:45 about to go to war and he starts
40:46 projecting the stuff in the sky and it's
40:48 just all those marching videos of
40:50 of hitler and they're just looking up
40:53 and it's all the
40:54 all the blitzkrieg stuff they've done
40:56 it's it's all the victory videos
40:58 of third reich and they end up looking
41:00 up and just being terrified of what they
41:02 see in the sky and of course the demons
41:04 roll over them in two seconds because
41:05 they're preoccupied with this mk ultra
41:07 thing going on in the sky right
41:10 that is the black apple and a cartoon
41:13 metaphor
41:15 so be aware where your thoughts come
41:16 from is it coming from within you is it
41:18 coming from outside you it's coming from
41:20 outside you
41:21 this sort of demonic force this sort of
41:25 negative layer of our existence is there
41:27 providing a constant challenge for our
41:29 character
41:30 when you write a movie the big thing
41:33 that they always tell you and it's the
41:34 best piece of advice i can give any
41:36 budding writer or someone who's in
41:39 writer's block
41:40 about how to develop their hero is
41:43 heroes are defined by the decisions they
41:45 make under pressure
41:47 that makes a hero look at all the movies
41:50 you've ever loved
41:51 that's what's happening whether it be a
41:53 real subtle romantic thing or some big
41:55 action movie
41:56 thing that's what's going on it's as if
41:59 god built that into our life
42:02 we have the choice do you want to get
42:04 fast easy money
42:05 but you're going to get a bunch of kids
42:06 addicted to drugs you're going to commit
42:08 suicide and all those deaths are on your
42:10 back
42:11 or you want to get a legitimate trade
42:12 skill work really hard
42:15 and pump something out get paid
42:18 legitimate money
42:20 everyone whoever goes into the dark side
42:22 always usually comes out if they don't
42:23 die young
42:24 and they're saying oh man you know i
42:26 love my legit job
42:28 way more than i love fearing for my life
42:31 everywhere i go
42:34 so the second half of this is to then
42:37 contemplate
42:40 does your well does a understanding of
42:44 the other
42:45 side of existence right the one that's
42:47 always there the entire time you're
42:48 there it's not just your afterlife it is
42:50 your afterlife but
42:52 that place exists every single day it's
42:54 a bustling place up there
42:58 on how many souls are up there and how
42:59 many souls are down here living in any
43:01 form of existence maybe there's more up
43:03 there
43:03 less up there who knows but if you had a
43:06 paradigm of belief
43:08 that had a little more structure and
43:10 more a little more logic to it
43:12 does it help you live your life down
43:14 here
43:18 well for instance let me give you an
43:20 example
43:22 you managed to listen to this episode
43:24 and for some reason you go yeah
43:25 satan most likely didn't exist that's
43:27 just a man-made thing to sort of explain
43:30 why there seems to be this ability to do
43:34 really evil stuff in this world
43:38 i struggle with the use of
43:42 you know satan or demons
43:45 or demonic things
43:49 what's very interesting to me is this is
43:51 kind of a funny thing but
43:53 in the book hitchhiker's guide the
43:55 galaxy in the first chapter
43:57 of the first book arthur dent gets
44:03 the world explodes he gets saved by his
44:05 buddy ford prefect
44:07 and he's in this vogon ship that's
44:10 actually one of the ships that's
44:11 destroying the earth and he gets sucked
44:13 up and he gets saved right
44:15 and all of a sudden the pa system comes
44:19 on inside the ship
44:20 and the vogon commander is talking and
44:23 he looks to forward
44:24 forward he goes look i can't speak vogue
44:25 on he goes don't worry just put this
44:27 fish in here and you're the slurpee
44:28 noise if you hear the
44:29 bbc original version which i posted on
44:33 the facebook page
44:36 just look under announcements
44:39 and all of a sudden you know he douglas
44:41 adams was beyond
44:43 the genius he created this fictitious
44:45 little
44:46 animal fish that
44:49 ate whatever someone was saying
44:53 and then excreted the translation
44:56 into your mind and so it was always
44:58 translating for like a universal
44:59 translator
45:00 for star trek and again everyone forgets
45:02 that
45:04 everywhere they've ever been in star
45:05 trek those other aliens are speaking
45:08 their language and the universal
45:10 translators making it possible for
45:11 everyone to understand they never quite
45:12 explain how it works biologically but
45:14 that's that's their fiction
45:18 so the the story is uh
45:21 the reason why i bring up that story is
45:22 that what if
45:26 there are beings that feed off of our
45:28 frequencies
45:30 they really don't initially care whether
45:33 we have a positive emotion or a negative
45:35 emotion
45:36 they just know that the logistics of
45:37 putting together a positive emotion
45:40 is a lot more complex than putting
45:41 together a negative
45:43 and we know this to be true in the
45:45 universe because
45:48 you build a house of cards remembering a
45:50 little kid someone teaches you can stack
45:51 up cards the little house of cards
45:54 well building it's really you know
45:56 tedious and you can knock it down in two
45:58 seconds but someone walking up and
45:59 knocking the whole thing down well
46:00 that's super easy
46:02 well that's how i see if there are
46:06 beings that feed off of all this and
46:09 they are
46:10 literally the beings that feed the black
46:12 apples to us
46:15 that that's what they do they know it's
46:18 easy
46:18 and maybe in their realm seeing all the
46:21 facts is super simple
46:22 i know that he's got that hots for that
46:25 girl and he's engaged to her and i'm
46:27 just going to mess this whole thing up
46:30 because tearing down the house of cards
46:31 is super easy
46:34 once you start having a belief system in
46:37 an afterlife with some sort of ecosystem
46:41 in it whether you believe you stay up
46:42 there forever
46:43 which i need you to explain how you
46:46 don't get bored
46:47 just forever is a really long time right
46:51 you then start to look at people who are
46:53 evil on earth
46:55 absolutely bona fide evil and you start
46:58 to realize
46:59 one common denominator if not maybe two
47:03 you would have one the atheist
47:07 there is no consequences for what i do
47:10 so i should just take care of myself 100
47:12 percent that
47:13 and the pure form of satanism as i've
47:15 had described to me from
47:17 youtube channel people to old interviews
47:21 in the 70s
47:22 that's what they believe they don't
47:25 believe in any gods of any kind
47:28 in fact one of the most modern
47:32 explanations of satanism
47:35 is from that guy he had a channel for
47:37 about eight years i think
47:38 if not even more now he's got the long
47:40 hair he's brunette
47:42 yeah i think he's he's not in america i
47:44 don't think but he wears the leather he
47:45 used to wear the leather jacket with no
47:46 shirt on
47:48 he's got millions of followers he's got
47:50 the youtube plaque on his wall he got in
47:52 before all the censorship
47:54 it's just funny because he talks about
47:55 stuff controversial every single day and
47:58 and he's i don't know if he's
48:00 demonetized or not but anyway
48:01 he talked about having been a satan
48:03 worshipper nieces look
48:05 inside the church of satan he goes
48:08 because um they don't believe in god
48:10 they don't believe in satan they think
48:12 if you believe in any religion then
48:13 you're
48:14 a sub follower of the church of satan
48:17 which is really interesting hillary
48:20 certainly likes moloch
48:23 but once you can just divorce yourself
48:25 from any
48:26 belief of consequence
48:30 it's very very interesting and i guess
48:31 you have to be completely absent of your
48:33 ability to ingest
48:34 after life experiences or near-death
48:36 experiences right
48:38 people dying to come back you have to
48:40 somehow write that off
48:42 you know again it's intellectual
48:43 cowardice i'm not going to process this
48:47 totally congruent information out of
48:49 multiple human beings over multiple
48:51 centuries
48:52 i'm going to just brush it off because
48:55 that and then
48:56 enables me to be a jerk to the world
49:00 now there plenty of great upstanding
49:02 atheists in this world
49:04 uh the the thing i have found within
49:09 deep thinkers who are atheists is that
49:11 they tend to
49:12 glob onto globalist agendas really
49:15 really easily
49:17 you know it's the whole thing of like
49:18 we're just going to make this utopia by
49:19 first making it a tyrannical
49:22 surveillance state you know as if those
49:23 two things could coexist at the same
49:25 time or one can lead to the other it's
49:28 just it's what we call
49:30 unthinking okay and if you don't believe
49:34 that don't take any offense you're not
49:35 one of those people
49:38 now i need to represent the other frame
49:41 of thought
49:42 from an atheist to a person of any
49:44 belief in a god
49:46 and that they think that we're cowards
49:48 and that we've invented these paradigms
49:51 to satiate uncertainty
49:55 or to satiate the conclusion that death
49:58 is death
50:00 again for me there's definitely an
50:03 afterlife
50:04 and you know um god i just hate even
50:08 mentioning this again but
50:10 you know um when you have a
50:13 an experience where you
50:17 meet someone from the other side right
50:19 my grandmother i'll tell you the other
50:20 story
50:20 my grandmother died i didn't know she
50:22 was even remotely close to death
50:25 she died and uh she came to me about 12
50:28 o'clock that
50:29 next day i don't know when she
50:30 technically died
50:33 but she told me she she said my name she
50:35 said you know
50:36 she goes i'm on the other side and i'm
50:38 okay i just want you to know
50:40 and i said okay and she's floating over
50:43 my bed
50:44 inside my minds i think my my eyes might
50:46 have been closed i don't know
50:48 and she you know floats up about two
50:50 hours later my mom calls me and she's
50:52 crying she says her mom died and i was
50:53 like
50:54 i know she came and told me of course my
50:56 mom just you know she can't go there so
50:58 she's
50:59 she's religious but she can't go there
51:01 you know so it was like i didn't even
51:03 say anything she was like a host from
51:05 westworld and then there's the
51:07 experience where i met
51:08 walt disney at disneyland long gone
51:11 he tells me about this dude i just met a
51:14 few weeks earlier
51:15 he's somewhere in the park he gives me
51:16 this beacon of where he is
51:19 i grab my girlfriend we walk right to
51:21 where he was standing right there
51:23 he's in a part of the park i never go to
51:25 so for me
51:27 okay explain that he's not in either
51:30 place
51:31 that the religion says that you can go
51:34 he's not
51:35 here alive okay because he's dead and
51:37 he's not up there
51:39 because he's here and i interviewed a
51:42 bunch of people from disneyland
51:43 after that meaning i even called up bob
51:45 gur the dude i
51:46 met you can look him up b-o-b g-u-r-r
51:50 he's got a wikipedia page he's very
51:51 famous
51:53 and he told me 10 years later because
51:56 i'm not even the slightest bit surprised
51:58 he's still alive he told me a bunch of
52:00 other stories
52:01 i talked to my buddy that ran security
52:02 disneyland not only did walt tell him to
52:05 get back from a
52:06 boiler that was going to explode on the
52:08 steamboat he turns to his buddy and says
52:11 did you hear that did you hear anything
52:12 or something like that and his buddy
52:14 goes we better get away we better move
52:16 back from this thing
52:17 both of them heard it they're standing
52:19 the edge of a boat
52:21 in the middle of that you know tom
52:22 sawyer area in disneyland here in
52:24 california anaheim
52:26 okay so while it's there so somehow you
52:29 can go where you need to go
52:30 i mean it seems to be pretty
52:32 free-flowing
52:35 it's interesting i guess one could get
52:39 really creative and construe that as a
52:41 hell for walt or something but
52:43 i don't get that feeling i swear to god
52:46 he had a cigarette in his hand when he
52:47 walked up to me
52:48 just it was just like he does have a
52:50 body
52:51 he definitely had a body in front of me
52:53 man it was in my mind's eye he wasn't
52:55 where anyone else could see him there
52:57 you go for me
52:59 for me i can't have an atheist belief
53:01 system
53:03 and you know i don't know it's like
53:06 um when i had that experience some of
53:09 the theories of having even a
53:11 demon in the world doesn't make any
53:13 sense either
53:15 you know i i once told um
53:19 episode probably season one or two just
53:22 the
53:22 the notion that what is evil to one
53:25 person is
53:26 not evil to another person and that's
53:28 what's weird about it
53:30 you know a sycophant that likes killing
53:33 people
53:34 okay well that guy's in a state of
53:36 euphoria what he's doing in
53:38 but for the person being murdered it's
53:39 obviously the most atrocious thing could
53:41 happen to you
53:43 isn't that weird how do you reconcile
53:45 that in your brain
53:48 but what if heaven is kind of like this
53:50 place god is there but he's sort of
53:52 omnipotent even up there you don't
53:54 necessarily see the dude
53:56 he's just you just know he's there
53:59 or maybe you meet him one time every
54:01 time you renew and
54:03 that's it you get your little report
54:05 card for the last
54:07 life that you lived and that's it
54:10 then it's do whatever you want and you
54:13 find out what you
54:15 can do just like you find out what you
54:16 can do in this world you just live
54:19 and you ask people questions oh yeah
54:22 you should do this do you like doing
54:23 that yeah totally let's go do it
54:25 okay you're no longer constrained by
54:28 your mortal coil you're not dying
54:31 you can't my belief in
54:36 sort of the afterlife um it does relate
54:39 to the
54:40 soul is that you can't hide energy in
54:44 the universe where would you put it
54:47 you're you're only um
54:50 i guess paradigm of belief or mechanism
54:53 for belief in true death i mean like you
54:55 truly cease to exist
54:58 would be that not only does your body
55:00 diffuse into this
55:01 soil of the earth ashes the ashes and
55:03 dust the dust
55:04 but your soul also diffuses into the
55:07 energy pocket that's out there
55:09 but of course scientists kind of screw
55:11 the whole thing up because they
55:13 they always like i've said in many
55:15 episodes
55:17 a scientist says if we don't have a
55:19 machine to
55:20 sense it then it doesn't exist
55:23 which always constrains man down to the
55:26 common denominator of what man has been
55:28 able to accomplish up to us
55:30 to a particular point
55:33 and so let's just say mass and energy
55:37 as defined by ether particles doing
55:38 things is never going to interact with
55:41 the soul
55:42 ever the only thing you can do
55:45 is look at the behaviors out of human
55:48 beings
55:48 using their coil such as someone who
55:51 dies
55:51 floats over their body has this painless
55:54 experience
55:55 talks to somebody some being maybe all
55:57 their relatives are there or whatever
55:58 and then they return back to their body
56:02 prior to fully exiting and then they can
56:05 tell us what they have experienced
56:09 and just so that you know i've said this
56:10 at least once
56:12 there are brand new documentaries out
56:14 there from near-death experienced people
56:17 full hd videos brilliant people
56:21 and every one of them say the exact same
56:23 thing in their own words they say
56:25 you will never convince me that
56:28 death is final ever no matter what
56:31 happens
56:32 they have no fear of death after they
56:34 have that experience
56:36 in a way as a human being if you stay in
56:39 your
56:40 limited paradigm of thinking and i'm not
56:42 saying that's a bad thing this is
56:43 actually
56:44 probably a good thing we don't have to
56:46 deal with conceiving of forever in a
56:48 human body
56:50 it's a kind of depending on your
56:53 development as a human being mentally
56:55 it can be a comforting thing eventually
56:57 you do recycle
56:58 and you get to be something else
57:03 you know there's um that old statement
57:06 i've mentioned this before too which is
57:08 that we
57:08 will often say that a person has an old
57:12 soul
57:14 you just sense it but you're not
57:17 supposed to believe in reincarnation if
57:18 you believe in religions because
57:20 religions control you
57:22 and if they think that you believe that
57:24 you're coming back then that sense of
57:26 control
57:27 is marginalized and they don't want that
57:29 to ever happen
57:30 they want you to believe you have one
57:32 life and if you don't sell your kids to
57:34 the
57:34 catholic church or all the other
57:37 churches
57:38 then you're not going anywhere you don't
57:41 get to go to heaven
57:43 i dislike that very much and not from uh
57:46 you can't tell me what to do perspective
57:48 but just from an ignorant
57:50 interpretation of basic things in front
57:52 of us i understand
57:54 it 2 000 years ago but i don't
57:56 understand it in 2020
57:58 we've been able to compare stories those
58:00 kids that are born and can remember
58:02 their previous life for a few years and
58:03 they tell their parents
58:04 oh yeah i used to live here and that's
58:06 uncle joe and that's aunt marie
58:08 and they asked him what's your name joe
58:09 what's your name marie oh my god my kids
58:11 remember your previous life
58:14 it's almost like it doesn't get a lot of
58:15 press
58:17 because it goes against too many fragile
58:20 paradigms that we believe
58:23 or want to believe another
58:26 thing about this whole paradigm of
58:28 thinking you know just like the same
58:30 thing with the space thinking
58:32 is that i do believe that a lot of
58:34 people know that they're full of it
58:38 and they i've talked about countless
58:42 stories on the show where you'll get
58:44 someone who's very devout and they
58:46 figure
58:46 if they can rehearse or sorry repeat
58:49 and regurgitate
58:52 tons of verses from the bible that
58:54 they're somehow extra protected against
58:56 any
58:57 calamity that might happen in a judgment
58:59 day scenario
59:02 but if you start to reiterate and play a
59:05 reflection session just like a
59:06 psychologist
59:08 iterating back to them some of the
59:09 things that they say and a lot of them
59:11 will contradict themselves
59:12 they get so furiously physically angry
59:15 at you in the room
59:17 and it's because you're making them see
59:19 their own doubt
59:21 that's always been there even before you
59:24 met him
59:26 i think if there's a satan of any kind
59:30 it would be because you know god would
59:34 be trying to create
59:35 choice
59:38 to allow you to be a hero making a
59:40 decision under pressure
59:43 do you take the easy way out and take
59:45 the hard way on
59:47 hard way out is usually creationism
59:50 beauty
59:51 art love the easy emotions are
59:55 hate and destruction
60:00 that's you know i have to say when you
60:01 look at your leaders
60:03 that you vote for those that swim
60:06 in the cesspool of darkness everything
60:09 they touch
60:10 turns to crap it's because they don't
60:13 have any experience
60:14 ever doing anything else with their life
60:17 but creating
60:18 evil and darkness and destruction
60:23 and those that take the harder path get
60:25 criticized by
60:26 all those dark people right
60:30 they attack the good because their
60:32 paradigm of being dark
60:35 is uh being threatened
60:38 and if you think about the world today
60:41 every country
60:44 we have people at the top who have
60:46 figured out a way
60:47 to create worldly benefits
60:51 by acting very very evil
60:55 now there is something that keeps
60:57 recurring in my mind i've mentioned it a
60:59 couple times before
61:00 i've never had anyone i don't think in
61:03 the comments ever really
61:04 kind of try to counter this thinking
61:08 but i have kind of have a positive
61:09 negative weird emotion with this whole
61:11 thing
61:12 and that is that you know we've had in
61:15 the on the internet
61:16 i'll spare you all the details but
61:18 there's been tremendous
61:20 evidence now presented that
61:23 those folks that have been controlling
61:26 the world and
61:27 trying to push things like agenda 21
61:29 everybody
61:31 they engage in these rituals where they
61:34 sacrifice human beings and
61:36 unfortunately the age bracket is
61:38 extremely
61:39 extremely young to to extract
61:43 like adrenal crohn's to get
61:48 all kinds of chemicals are dumped in
61:49 their blood when they're terrified
61:51 to get high i mean it's just it's just
61:53 insane
61:56 but we're ready to put all these people
61:57 in jail we're ready to
61:59 euthanize all these people we are since
62:02 we prove they've done this once
62:04 you gotta get in that chamber where
62:05 you're gonna die god's gonna sort it out
62:07 right
62:10 but within the paradigm of christianity
62:13 there's communion which i've had amazing
62:18 i think spiritual closeness hopefully
62:20 with god
62:23 but i'm eating an effigy of
62:26 flesh and blood which is a satanic
62:29 ritual
62:32 i don't know how it becomes good if i do
62:34 it and it's
62:35 the blood and flesh of someone who's
62:37 good
62:39 seems like a strange thing
62:42 because it could have been substituted
62:44 with far
62:46 more specific things you know
62:49 the other pre-rituals that happen before
62:52 these sacrifices occur which are also
62:54 massively horrific
62:57 and it's one of these things of did
62:59 someone pull the wall over us at the
63:01 very beginning of the whole
63:03 paradigm of worship a lot of religions
63:06 don't get close to anything like
63:09 the american predominant religion of
63:11 christianity right
63:12 but the bible's got all kinds of
63:13 wonderful things in it too
63:16 someone slipped this in it's a strange
63:19 thing
63:21 the other one is to say if there were
63:23 these angels okay
63:25 the idea that any one of them could get
63:28 to a negative state
63:29 again they would have to exit the
63:30 paradigm of god which is impossible
63:33 because if you get out of his paradigm
63:34 you don't exist
63:37 as the theory goes right
63:41 but it's always good to remember that if
63:42 you're in the presence of god
63:44 either through heavenly god or an
63:47 earthly jesus god
63:49 you your requirement for faith is zero
63:53 because you have proof in front of your
63:54 face
63:56 think about all the disciples that we
63:58 look up to
64:00 all right they had proof they got to see
64:04 miracles walking on water and raising
64:07 people from the dead and
64:08 dozens of other things so if christ
64:11 walked up to you and said give me
64:12 you know get rid of all your stuff and
64:14 follow me you're a zero level of faith
64:17 you've had it proven to you so
64:20 to say that something's angelic
64:23 really um if i'm down here on this
64:27 planet with no confirmation
64:29 besides my own observations and
64:30 interpretations of a creator
64:33 or an afterlife if i'm not willing to
64:35 take in those
64:37 stories that people give us if i'm just
64:39 a coward
64:42 and i still have faith or you still have
64:45 faith
64:47 but i would say that you eclipse any
64:49 angel that you would
64:51 give your soul to because you've had to
64:54 work for it
64:57 you've had no confirmations and you
64:58 still believe
65:00 well that means you're on level 10 and
65:02 they're on level one or zero
65:06 you in the eyes of god would so eclipse
65:09 an
65:09 angel you would have so eclipsed anyone
65:12 ever met
65:12 christ that you would be
65:16 the gift of god gift to god of his
65:19 creation you know you'd be like the
65:21 kid that he was very proud of having
65:25 and i think that's very interesting and
65:26 something you should give yourself
65:27 credit for
65:29 if you do indeed believe in such things
65:32 i hope you feel me lots of uh subjects
65:36 here
65:37 to uh feedback on definitely
65:41 you know be very interested in uh what
65:43 you think and again like i always say
65:45 in your comments
65:50 not like quoting from the bible is a bad
65:52 thing in your response
65:55 but it's sort of like looking at the
65:56 definition of a word and the definition
65:58 is the word itself
65:59 it is sort of a self-defining thing
66:03 i'd be more interested in your thoughts
66:05 outside of
66:07 a bible because that's you having an iq
66:11 instead of just being a memorizer and
66:13 repeater
66:14 that does nothing for you right god gave
66:18 you a brain
66:19 make sure you use it it feels really
66:21 good when you use your brain
66:22 it's awesome right so if you're gonna
66:24 like comment
66:25 you might say this passage here
66:27 translated to me
66:29 this way and it increased my thinking
66:32 and my connection points such that i was
66:35 able to have in my opinion
66:37 a better understanding of god that would
66:40 be a really cool comment
66:41 but just let me know what you think
66:44 it's just one more of those uh weekly
66:47 summer
