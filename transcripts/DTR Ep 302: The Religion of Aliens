00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts today we're going to talk
00:38 about the religion of aliens as promised
00:43 I went back and listened to the the near
00:48 two-hour episode I did and I it's funny
00:52 how when the video goes wrong or the
00:54 audio goes wrong and you go back and
00:57 listen to it you're thinking jeez it's
00:59 probably a good thing that episode died
01:00 my energy was good information it's just
01:03 my energy was not the right right level
01:05 for a season 4 episode so anyway welcome
01:08 back so what is this episode about I was
01:14 going to go through a couple different
01:15 stages it was all sort of spawned by a
01:19 listener who was commenting in the
01:21 YouTube comments and he said you know
01:23 you should go check out dr. David Jacobs
01:26 dr. David Jacobs I hadn't heard of him
01:29 before as an individual who is I guess
01:33 good friends with John Hopkins of that
01:36 medical institution who was at hip
01:42 hypnosis guy hypnotist and so in the 60s
01:50 dr. David Jacobs wrote a paper about how
01:52 UFOs were affecting society he got his
01:54 PhD I don't know how you do that I don't
01:56 know what his PhD was then I forgot I
01:58 watched about three and a half hours of
02:00 interviews with him he's extremely
02:02 repetitive so if you ever want to
02:04 research this guy just find yourself
02:05 about an hour's worth of interview and
02:07 you will not hear anything new from
02:10 different interviews but if you listen
02:13 to this episode you probably can skip
02:15 all that research yourself like a lot of
02:18 us he was very curious as the story goes
02:22 in 1985 dr. David Jacobs began to in an
02:26 amateur sense and he's very forthcoming
02:29 in this began to interview people who
02:32 said they were abducted by aliens he
02:36 also was very concerned with something
02:39 called confabulation which is when the
02:41 hypnotist suggests something to the
02:45 person and the person goes with that
02:48 and when you have someone who's willing
02:51 to be led by you on a routine basis
02:54 within a hypnotist or hypnotherapist
03:05 they go with the flow a little too much
03:07 right when you listen to a David Jacobs
03:11 video he spends about 10 minutes going
03:15 through the problems of hypnotic
03:18 sessions confabulation and the fact that
03:22 he's an amateur he says that a person
03:25 who is willing to be hypnotized it's
03:27 actually not truly under any spell they
03:32 just are agreeing to be questioned and
03:35 they're agreeing to go down deeper into
03:36 the suggestive realm of their brain but
03:39 they should be cognitive of what
03:41 happened while they were down and his
03:46 big thing was he goes you know I'd do
03:47 this in the room sometimes with you know
03:50 two people so I got one person going
03:52 under and the other probe with the words
03:53 that I'm saying and the other person's
03:55 listening and they're not going under he
03:58 goes that should show you how you have
04:01 to participate in this process
04:03 well that was fascinating because I
04:05 never heard anyone say that before
04:07 I've only remotely attempted hypnosis
04:13 with a good friend of mine if you listen
04:16 to all my episodes my friend who was who
04:19 is the true autists without vaccinations
04:23 brilliant guy he put me under hypnosis
04:27 were probably about four or five hours
04:29 trying to see if there was something
04:32 about this alien thing because of my
04:33 Christmas present thing when back in
04:36 1990 and we didn't really find anything
04:40 I feel like I remembered everything but
04:42 time really did pass but what dr. David
04:47 Jacobs is getting at really started to
04:49 peel away where the evolution of the
04:55 theory of aliens is going not just an
04:58 episode that said you know grey aliens
05:00 exist so you know where my
05:01 position is at least with those
05:04 individuals but I also believe that God
05:07 exists and that Christians know fuck-all
05:09 about God right I think if you want to
05:13 get in as most in as much trouble as you
05:15 possibly can with your Creator and I
05:18 don't believe our Creator gets angry
05:19 whatsoever but if there were such a
05:22 thing go worship Christianity Islam
05:27 Judaism and then go talk to your God and
05:30 it's just gonna be one of these like
05:32 looks from God of like the [ __ ] were you
05:36 doing you know I told you everything
05:38 it's you know the kingdom of God is
05:41 within all men you didn't need anything
05:43 else so I don't you know when I go at
05:46 the alien culture and the movement
05:49 around the alien culture in this episode
05:51 I don't want you to believe that I'm
05:52 against you especially if you believe in
05:55 aliens I just made an episode where I
05:57 say that the Roswell crash eyewitness
06:00 testimonies and secondhand testimonies
06:02 of those married two or the sons and
06:04 daughters thereof of the individuals you
06:06 have nothing to gain who are on their
06:09 deathbeds
06:10 I mean we've seen them now we've seen
06:11 people really old start to give up some
06:14 stuff and there are people who are
06:16 giving up stories that I think are
06:17 actually untrue
06:18 but it's weird there's a distinct purity
06:23 with those that give up their stories in
06:25 Roswell and those that are in modern-day
06:28 confessions in the last 10 years because
06:30 the ones I watched were at least 25
06:34 years old if not 4050 years old for me
06:39 that's just validation that goes places
06:41 and being from a small little town in
06:43 the Midwest I know what old people are
06:45 like I know what tall tales sound like I
06:47 know the tone of their voice when they
06:50 go in that direction according to me
06:54 okay but dr. David Jacobs starts his
07:00 tale in 1985 which is a very interesting
07:03 time because this is about the time that
07:04 Whitley Strieber started figuring out oh
07:06 my god I may never sell another book
07:08 again into movie rights like cat people
07:10 and so I'm going to start getting on to
07:12 this new thing which is this big alien
07:15 it's a kind of a new trendy way to write
07:17 and thing to write about and so he
07:19 writes the book communion and says that
07:24 he's getting abducted like 24/7 up in
07:26 upstate New York it's unbelievable right
07:29 then he writes transformation then he
07:32 writes his third book I forgot what's
07:37 all about it'll come to me he just
07:40 basically makes a [ __ ] ton of money off
07:42 this he also writes a little paperback
07:43 on the side called him the project
07:44 majestic which was great so there was
07:49 definitely a writing trend the publisher
07:51 was saying this is a cool thing to write
07:53 about very similar to the doomsday
07:55 stories of 2012 and all this other stuff
07:57 so you know I don't know maybe Jacobs is
08:01 one of those guys I don't know he's
08:06 definitely much better at seeming honest
08:09 if he is dishonest than most folks but
08:15 I'm just gonna go with the fact that
08:16 maybe he's telling the truth about what
08:17 he discovers because his routine is to
08:19 interview people during hypnotic
08:21 sessions as the hypnotist he again tries
08:25 to weigh out Kitab ulation and the
08:28 example he gives for confabulation as he
08:30 says look someone will say they woke up
08:33 in their home or whatever or some
08:34 location and there's a light in the room
08:36 and he goes what I'll typically do to
08:38 figure out whether or not they're going
08:40 to be susceptible to suggestibility is
08:43 he says I'll say oh so the light filled
08:45 the entire room because they haven't
08:47 said how much the light fills the room
08:49 and he says if they go oh yeah yeah yeah
08:52 totally
08:53 then he puts a little ticking in their
08:55 sheet and says well this person's way to
08:56 go with my suggestion but if they say no
09:00 no no no no it's like coming in one
09:02 window not the whole room then he's like
09:04 okay they're owning their own experience
09:06 whether it be a dream or what-have-you
09:09 it's there so where does religion come
09:12 into this I have a choice here I can
09:15 tell you dr. Jacobs entire story about
09:20 the evolution of these interviews
09:22 because he's telling us that when he
09:25 started interviewing in the 80s he says
09:27 most the stories were all about
09:29 gray aliens that was it and then as he
09:32 goes into the 90s in the 2000s 21st
09:35 century it starts turning into all these
09:36 stories about hybrids now some people
09:40 who have interviewed him have been very
09:41 astute and they said you know don't you
09:43 think mr. Jacobs dr. Jacobs that this
09:45 could just be the fact that the story
09:47 has evolved in movies the story has
09:49 evolved among people on the Internet and
09:53 so this hybrid theory is really starting
09:54 to become popular and now you're just
09:56 getting the feedback loop and he's like
09:57 yeah yeah but he doesn't really want to
09:59 admit that he never really does a deep
10:02 dive in the interview but the people
10:04 interviewing him are hip to the fact
10:06 that that's probably what's like what's
10:07 occurring right but dr. Jacobs says you
10:11 know well there's so much detail in
10:13 these stories about hybrids I find it
10:15 hard to believe that some of the IQs of
10:16 people that I've interviewed I'm
10:18 paraphrasing of course could come up
10:21 with such details and I think well
10:22 that's because you underestimate man
10:26 again you could have someone with a 50
10:29 IQ who's dreaming
10:31 thx 1 3 8 8 K 16 K movies of incredible
10:38 proportions and when they wake up they
10:40 couldn't add one plus one so there's
10:43 knowledge within and there's knowledge
10:44 outside of us right there's there's
10:47 physical human body $0.05 knowledge and
10:50 then there's your soul knowledge which
10:51 might just well be infinite one of the
10:56 things that you'll hear out of Jacob's
10:59 really early is that he believes that if
11:01 you've ever reported any abduction with
11:04 him that the trend by those that are
11:08 more capable of giving the details is
11:11 that you have been chosen your entire
11:13 life wow that's powerful right and this
11:17 is where we start stepping our foot into
11:20 the shallow shores of religion with this
11:23 UFO movement well wouldn't that make you
11:28 feel special that you've been chosen to
11:32 be this way maybe you have DNA that's
11:37 special maybe you're a hybrid you don't
11:38 even know it or maybe that you just got
11:40 randomly picked at the beginning and now
11:42 you
11:42 have sort of special access you know
11:44 somebody always lives next I was born
11:46 and becomes the neighbor you know
11:48 becomes a family friend as long as
11:50 you're not a jerk-off and so boy if you
11:52 like eighties rock you know you're
11:54 living next to a legend you can get him
11:56 on the phone you can go knock on the
11:57 door you get invited to Christmas so
12:00 it's one way or the other
12:02 it's really funny I've had in a a funny
12:08 little moment with that whole theory and
12:10 this is and I'm not being terribly
12:11 serious here but when I was a kid like a
12:14 baby
12:16 they would when I got taken back from
12:18 Europe to Kansas to visit my family they
12:24 would put me outside in a crib with you
12:27 know the sky I would sit as a child
12:30 looking at the moon looking at the stars
12:32 as a baby baby unable to speak but I
12:35 remembered what the adults told me it's
12:36 religious I remember the scene where mom
12:38 was pointing at the moon and goes
12:39 there's men up there right now
12:42 and I was like I can't talk but I get
12:44 you like I totally remember her saying
12:47 that and I remember without having a
12:50 hell of a lot of context as a tiny baby
12:53 having enough soul memory and soul
12:56 knowledge you know what I brought to the
12:59 baby's body the fetus that I had hibbett
13:02 it I remember what that meant and as a
13:07 baby you wouldn't have any context for
13:08 moon men they're all that kind of stuff
13:12 it's fascinating right
13:16 we're hairy I'm outside in this crib
13:17 it's like hey if aliens want to come by
13:19 and go hey you should get a little chip
13:21 you know hey I was out there so far
13:25 haven't found any alien implants but dr.
13:29 Jacobs is not alone in this notion that
13:31 he believes that people have been
13:32 abducted for life that they have these
13:34 traumatic experiences that go back to
13:36 their childhood and he uses hypnosis to
13:38 do it to figure out to mine it I think
13:42 it's very interesting hypnosis is
13:45 predicated on the notion in most cases
13:48 that we are nothing but human bodies
13:51 with the bag of chemicals when you go to
13:54 Scientology and the people that you know
13:57 the Scientology is based on they will
14:00 say no no no this is actually talking to
14:02 your soul and you're gonna be able to
14:03 regress back to what you were before
14:05 it's the Scientology's whole shtick hey
14:08 there may be something to it the number
14:10 of the number of chicks I've talked to
14:12 who think they were Nefertiti means that
14:14 she was possessed by at least a thousand
14:16 chicks from the Midwest everyone was a
14:19 pharaoh everybody was Winston Churchill
14:21 right but when you tell someone that
14:23 they're chosen my god you create this
14:25 unity you create this this feeling that
14:29 it's like well I don't know why I would
14:32 be chosen I don't feel different as a
14:34 human being but there must be something
14:35 special about me so perhaps my opinions
14:37 of all things are validated above all
14:40 others it's funny how you'll meet an
14:44 evangelical Christian person and they
14:47 will be telling you how they have the
14:49 way you need to be rebaptised because
14:51 the baptized that you have is on [ __ ]
14:53 discount was a piece of [ __ ] baptism and
14:56 you know God has bestowed it upon their
14:58 leader to give you the good kind but
15:02 when you really deep dive deep into
15:04 their intellect and their knowledge of
15:06 the Bible in general it's pretty shallow
15:07 in most cases the best I've ever found
15:10 is an old man who can pull up on the
15:13 Bible and hit every single verse oh you
15:14 know it's funny you mentioned that bleep
15:16 up stood open he finds a really profound
15:17 verse that matches what you're talking
15:19 about and that's cool but he's just a
15:21 jeopardy contestant at that point right
15:23 he's not getting into this super sub
15:25 textual context and the super metaphor
15:27 and allegory that is the Bible
15:30 so walking around thinking that you know
15:33 hey I got a new roommate my ass hurts
15:37 and I'm gonna pawn it off on anal probes
15:39 over here instead of kicking this guy
15:41 out for a roofing me every night you
15:43 know that's how you feel special now
15:46 could be obviously everything I'm kind
15:49 of playing devil's advocate too could be
15:51 actually true but I think if you're
15:53 chosen and there's something super
15:56 special about your conscious DNA we will
15:58 know I would think that you're
16:01 measurable like you might be a little
16:02 bit higher but maybe not maybe the
16:05 methodology that we major IQ by which is
16:07 critical thinking and deduction isn't
16:09 the quality that is being augmented in
16:13 you but I would assume that there's
16:17 something you know maybe you can build a
16:20 skyscraper out of matchsticks or
16:22 something there's something about you if
16:24 not you're just a normal person and you
16:26 were selected and you're being
16:27 constantly visited and good for you I
16:29 hope your body holds together but I
16:33 mentioned this a little bit in the first
16:35 episode of season 4 why do we believe in
16:38 aliens at all because we didn't a long
16:42 time ago 500 years ago before the only
16:49 thing that remotely felt like aliens
16:51 were angels and demons from the sky
16:54 comes these agents of God and you know
16:58 it was interesting because then we
16:59 switched over after Roswell to people
17:03 from space and then it took us you know
17:07 70 years to start demonizing these guys
17:09 as angels or demons right interesting
17:15 why do we believe in dinosaurs again man
17:19 excavated metric cities of soil out of
17:22 the ground before the late 1850s when a
17:26 single tooth was found and a [ __ ]
17:28 dinosaur was built around that tooth
17:30 which just so happens to match all the
17:31 dinosaurs today we never found any
17:33 dinosaur bones before 1850s the two guys
17:37 that found the first two a femur bone
17:39 and the tooth and went at it for forty
17:41 years their entire life's career
17:44 was deprecated as utter fraud in the
17:48 spirit of competing with each other but
17:49 everything that they found and
17:50 fabricated was then adopted by Natural
17:52 History Museum's and now it is the way
17:54 it is so where did we get aliens could
17:58 it be so easy oh yes it could be so easy
18:03 why don't we hear about miracles anymore
18:08 like the ones written in the Bible like
18:11 a Christ walking around why isn't God
18:14 you know visiting half of us who are you
18:17 know like souls and and transforming us
18:19 into Paul's why isn't someone in Ezekiel
18:24 why isn't someone a prophet I mean a
18:26 real prophet man they say this shit's
18:28 gonna happen on this day and it happens
18:31 because we have a printing press and
18:34 nearly every human being on earth
18:36 carries with them 2 HD cameras and there
18:40 is no evidence of anything going on even
18:43 ghosts have taken a big backseat to
18:46 modern technology well why did Christ
18:48 end why was he the last giant prophet
18:52 that anyone had fabricated into an
18:54 existence because the printing press
18:56 came around eventually in the 20th
18:58 century a really neat 19th century but
19:01 you have cameras and video cameras then
19:04 cell phones 21st century is locked down
19:06 surveillance wise if Jesus ever tried to
19:09 show up or anybody try to show up we'd
19:11 have them in HD we'd have them in a face
19:14 recognition database you probably have
19:16 them on Facebook you know but now what
19:19 if things like aliens are not biblically
19:21 bound they are simply the result of a
19:26 random visit because to answer our
19:30 question we believe in aliens because
19:33 the world became round and we became
19:36 severely insignificant like The
19:39 Hitchhiker's Guide the galaxy we're in
19:41 the total perspective vortex 24/7 an
19:43 infinite small dot on an infinite small
19:46 dot infinitely small within the realm of
19:50 man's common understanding we live on a
19:52 planet that has a solar system that's in
19:54 a galaxy that's in a universe
19:56 [ __ ] still believe in the Big Bang
19:59 unbelievable un-fuckin'-believable that
20:01 that theory keeps going but regardless
20:05 of the Big Bang we have this
20:08 mathematical notion that if we are
20:10 serendipitously just here as this random
20:14 event something from nothing theory of
20:16 existence when all life on Earth is
20:18 beautiful and looks like it's hand
20:20 manicured and design I mean hell we got
20:22 color schemes on things you know fish
20:25 and insects and you know praying mantis
20:30 that look like they're literally like
20:31 god's little lamborghini
20:34 there's a lot of proof in my opinion
20:37 that there's a divine intervention to
20:38 what's going on here but eventually
20:41 someone just comes up with a theory of
20:44 course there are going to be other life
20:46 beings out there and of course they're
20:50 not going to be influenced by the
20:51 Earth's gravity all Earth's experiences
20:54 the other indigenous creatures of this
20:56 planet are fish are insects are animals
20:57 whatever they may not breathe pure
21:00 oxygen and so not that we do either but
21:08 this theory is hatched and we're waiting
21:11 for something to galvanize it into the
21:15 into the intellect of man what event is
21:17 going to finally make this true right
21:19 they theorized the dinosaur you know one
21:24 of Darwin's disciples theorized is it
21:26 and then boom we found a tooth
21:28 wow how [ __ ] convenient all right
21:32 again
21:33 Roswell interesting maybe they conducted
21:38 a big MKULTRA experiment on a whole town
21:40 of Roswell Roswell excuse me and got
21:43 everybody to say a particular story drug
21:46 them just like Jacob's Ladder the movie
21:49 expose them the pictures and dolls and
21:52 all this other stuff and you know
21:54 rehearse stories with them and told them
21:56 things while they were asleep and
21:57 everyone comes out of it saying yes real
22:00 and I look at it and I personally with
22:02 my travels go man that seems like that
22:04 person is telling the truth hey maybe
22:06 never been theorized but like that you
22:09 good little x-files episode
22:10 wouldn't it but that's why we believe in
22:16 aliens is because we have certain we
22:17 have advanced our theory up inside of
22:20 our brains that we can't be the only
22:21 ones here it doesn't matter if you
22:24 believe in a firmament don't either you
22:25 could adopt this theory either way
22:27 they're the dumb owners there's some
22:29 other servant of God the one thing I
22:32 forgot to mention in the grey aliens
22:34 episode that I have seen pretty well
22:37 animated online which is for interesting
22:39 you know just someone trying to give you
22:40 an idea of what it was so that gray
22:42 aliens are angels this is when it was in
22:45 the Angels state not the demon state and
22:47 that people said they were being
22:48 abducted waking up inside the spacecraft
22:50 and the aliens were showing them the
22:54 souls that were going to be there their
22:56 children their relatives their friends
22:59 or they would show them a soul that had
23:01 passed on like a mother who had passed
23:02 away but the month but the woman is
23:04 actually pregnant so she's saying here's
23:07 your mom you can sense that your mom
23:09 it's a glowing ball of light say hi and
23:11 we're gonna put this soul into your into
23:14 your fetus and so you're gonna give
23:16 birth to your mother yeah that's pretty
23:19 cool little sci-fi story right nothing
23:22 against a good story so I think it's
23:27 interesting to review it's important to
23:29 review how we gained this theory of
23:32 aliens and again it seems like the 1947
23:35 crash of Roswell is a very catalyzing
23:37 event for the validation of such things
23:39 but going back to dr. David Jacobs he
23:45 said that the stories that he was
23:46 getting out of people he still says it
23:47 to this day have evolved tremendously
23:53 again for a very long time
23:55 I'm gonna guess maybe ten years most of
23:57 the abductions were always gray aliens
24:00 grey aliens gray aliens as the internet
24:04 seems to have come online between 85 and
24:05 95 well the idea of hybrid starts to
24:09 cross-pollinate into society and all the
24:11 sudden his stories slowly transform into
24:14 hybrids
24:15 you know half human looking half gray
24:18 looking beings
24:20 he has another name for one of them
24:22 which is
24:23 a human hybrid which is what I assume
24:26 the hybrids are anyway the one of them
24:28 is very very human-like and you can't
24:30 tell the difference supposedly besides
24:32 their behavior right this goes all the
24:36 way out of Grey's abducting folks all
24:39 the way up to humans error sorry these
24:42 alien humans that are sequestering
24:46 apartments with their captors so they're
24:50 saying you have to put me up in New York
24:52 City in your suite you can't have a
24:53 boyfriend you can't have a girlfriend
24:55 you have to harbor us and he says this
24:58 like there's two to one at least ratio
25:00 if you talk about it they say that they
25:03 will threaten to threaten to kill the
25:06 people and all this other stuff okay he
25:09 went as far as to say that some of them
25:11 have threatened to kill him the doctor
25:15 for engaging in hypnosis and trying to
25:18 figure out who these people are so he
25:21 puts himself at this great Marta Don
25:23 risk factor that and I am I'm a paladin
25:26 for truth because I have my life
25:29 threatened by aliens but when you really
25:34 think it through about an alien that
25:36 would be threatening again you're
25:38 talking about an advanced intellect
25:41 issuing threats
25:42 well threats are not usually the way to
25:44 get anything done in this world right if
25:46 you're gonna do something you just do it
25:48 it's just as simple maybe a bit one
25:51 caution out there but after that you've
25:53 got to follow up with your with your
25:55 threat otherwise your word is worth
25:57 nothing you're the boy that called wolf
25:59 that never makes anything take place so
26:03 I find that hard to believe I find
26:05 someone is just making that [ __ ] up the
26:09 fact that this guy has personally never
26:10 been visited by one is also one of these
26:13 kind of things of like really you're
26:15 sort of an authority on earth about this
26:17 kind of stuff and they know you exist
26:18 and they're threatening their subjects
26:20 with hurting you and they don't visit
26:22 you and say hey yeah yeah we got some
26:26 [ __ ] coming and you're [ __ ] it all up
26:28 and if you like being in one piece do
26:32 you like having a wife and kids and
26:34 whatever you shut your piehole do
26:37 that never happens mm-hmm so they like
26:41 they lacked the most basic thought
26:43 process / cause-and-effect mechanisms of
26:46 mankind this is where aliens start to
26:48 become just like religion very man-like
26:51 right God has never been more hobbled
26:55 and more trivialized than religion
27:01 trying to explain man explain God excuse
27:04 me right God gets mad like a little baby
27:08 [ __ ] he gets mad go see my episode
27:10 does God get angry it's all [ __ ] a
27:13 Supreme Being does not get angry
27:15 it just doesn't just you know just a few
27:19 times more intelligent than mankind and
27:21 and that being if you had a guy here so
27:23 so 180 is supposed to be the top IQ and
27:25 I hate singing IQ because it's sort of a
27:27 BS construct but anyway let's just say
27:30 whatever we want to measure the the most
27:32 intelligence by we give a human being
27:35 four times the intelligence of the
27:36 average human beings maximum apex of
27:38 intelligence do you think that person
27:41 with four times the IQ could ever get
27:43 angry on this planet no because
27:45 everything that's going to happen to
27:46 them they could predict it all right but
27:48 that kid's gonna break up yeah yeah if
27:49 they did I bet he's gonna cheat on his
27:51 girlfriend not yeah so totally yeah yeah
27:53 because I'm that smart and you have God
27:55 that's infinitely holding those whole
27:57 place together with all of his
27:59 algorithms yeah I'm sure he gets really
28:02 upset mm-hmm
28:04 because he's got a lot of surprises in
28:05 his life the burden of God is that he he
28:11 knows not the feeling of opening a
28:14 Christmas present
28:14 how sacrificial is that man he by
28:19 definition cannot limit his knowledge of
28:21 anything otherwise a huge sector of the
28:23 universe ceases to exist these are my
28:27 feelings of course
28:31 but there's another religious construct
28:33 through dr. Jacobs personal sessions and
28:37 I'm assuming that other people that do
28:38 these hypnotic sessions are having the
28:41 same feedback which is that they are
28:45 being told by the greys and by these
28:47 hybrids or whatever that something great
28:49 is coming something great is coming and
28:52 when the humans go well okay great what
28:54 is it we can't tell you okay all right
29:00 so we have we have two things happening
29:04 we have a very Second Coming arc of a
29:07 story coming which is hey something's
29:10 great that's coming your way but because
29:12 the human being may be embellishing and
29:14 lying about the whole thing
29:15 they don't want to have to speculate
29:17 what that is and so it's all hidden it's
29:20 all completely hidden okay yeah I've
29:24 said a couple times on the show I'm
29:25 gonna review it with you very quickly I
29:27 used to watch or listen to coast to
29:29 coast am with George Noory an art Bell
29:36 way back in the day and there's a
29:39 pattern I think it's really just a PSYOP
29:40 training ground you want to see how well
29:43 you can lie do it and it's not all that
29:44 people involved with intelligence
29:46 agencies or anything like that but boy
29:48 they're pining for it let me tell you
29:50 but all the interviews of outrageous
29:52 claims go exactly the same way on that
29:54 show someone comes on and they've
29:56 written a book or usually written a book
29:58 or they're a return guest and they are
30:02 propped up for a reason and George Noory
30:07 will go through it introduce them and
30:10 for instance one of them was a gentleman
30:12 that came on and said that he was a time
30:15 traveler that he was going to lots of
30:16 different planets and spending years
30:18 there and that he even traveled with
30:20 Barack Obama at one point we got a bunch
30:23 of [ __ ] [ __ ] why because some
30:25 liberal wants to make him even more
30:28 insane right more intense more oh man
30:30 he's in the inside even accused one of
30:33 his acquaintances of going with him and
30:36 that guy called up the show by the end
30:38 of the show and said you know I've only
30:40 met one time at a trade show I have no
30:42 [ __ ] clue who you are
30:44 just so your listeners know mr. nori I
30:46 don't know this guy we've never done
30:48 anything together he's a liar and what's
30:50 the guide say absolutely brilliant
30:52 response he says well in your timeline
30:54 it hasn't happened yet puh how how great
31:01 conman can just cover their tracks it's
31:04 beautiful but the formula is usually
31:06 this the opening salvo of the story on
31:08 coast to coast is a beautiful ornate
31:11 gripping storyline right it's got a
31:13 premise doesn't have usually much of a
31:15 story but whatever you don't really care
31:17 it's all science fiction's kind of stuff
31:19 this guy said he was going to other
31:21 planets and spending time there with a
31:23 bunch of other astronauts and that you
31:25 know NASA has these you know programs
31:27 like again the finale of 2001 or excuse
31:29 me at Close Encounters they're kind
31:31 Dreyfuss taken off on the mother ship
31:33 but now they switch it over to collars
31:36 so after by half an hour they bring the
31:37 collars in and the collars are just like
31:40 you and me asking logical questions I
31:42 remember listening to this and the guy
31:45 said first caller said well okay you go
31:48 to other planets right yeah mm-hmm he
31:50 says okay what does it look like what do
31:52 those planets look like and you hear
31:54 this dead silence on the radio for
31:56 probably I seem like forever spy five
31:58 seconds or so was the guy say ooh
32:03 well you know it's funny it's you it
32:05 looks just like this place you know it
32:06 looks pretty much just like this place
32:08 hilarious right yeah alien culture as
32:12 asphalt highways GM traffic fast food
32:15 burgers yeah looks just like this place
32:18 right give me a [ __ ] break
32:22 yeah and George is just sitting there
32:25 he's just flushing his integrity down
32:28 the drain for not jumping on this guy
32:30 and going wait a minute wait a minute
32:31 you're gonna tell us you went to another
32:33 planet but you're gonna tell me the
32:34 place looks like this I don't believe
32:36 you
32:37 you have suddenly gone from having an
32:39 interesting story to having a very
32:41 elaborate lie so until you can give us a
32:45 decent answer on this one you don't need
32:47 to talk anymore
32:47 you're a liar I think you're a liar
32:52 something to that effect yeah we got a
32:54 call a [ __ ] on people we do right if
32:56 I said some tall tale on one of the
32:58 shows what do you think the response
33:00 would be people would eat me alive and I
33:03 would deserve it right where have we
33:07 seen this before
33:09 project disclosure dr. Steven Greer I do
33:14 not know if dr. Steven Greer is a good
33:15 guy or a bad guy he seems to be embedded
33:18 with some agencies that are a bit
33:20 questionable but you never know I'm not
33:22 gonna accuse him of anything just keep
33:24 my eyes open my ears open in my mind
33:26 open I believe his first conference was
33:31 like 2001 where he brought together all
33:32 these people on a really long conference
33:34 table and I was like a press conference
33:37 table like a panelists table they're all
33:39 facing the audience of all these
33:41 reporters and these men were going up to
33:45 the podium and recalling an experience
33:48 that they were involved in and then at
33:50 the very end they said I am this person
33:52 at this rank of this agency in the
33:54 government and I am willing to testify
33:55 in a court of law that everything I just
33:57 said is true
33:58 very powerful I thought that was just
34:01 really super cool but you get to the end
34:04 of the conference where there's Q&A with
34:06 the press and I don't know how the
34:11 subject matter came up but one guy at
34:13 the end of the if you're facing the
34:15 table he's on the end of the right side
34:16 second-to-the-last I think and this guy
34:19 chimes in and says well you know what
34:21 there's like 29 different species of
34:23 aliens and I've seen a bunch of them
34:26 I've seen most of them he says okay boy
34:30 how special did he just become in that
34:32 room right so this British woman I think
34:37 she's from the BBC but a British
34:39 journalist says really what do they look
34:45 like and there goes the pause there goes
34:49 the pause of oh [ __ ] I am such a bad
34:52 liar that I didn't think about my lie
34:53 being called immediately by the press
34:58 he's sitting right there in front of the
35:00 press now again the IQ of someone that
35:03 would embellish a lie of that magnitude
35:05 is the same side of sort of lack of IQ
35:07 of a person who wouldn't assume there
35:08 would be a follow-up question
35:11 he goes uh and just like the Costa Coast
35:14 guy listen to the answer he says well
35:17 they look like us let him look like us
35:21 okay all right that certainly is
35:24 convenient isn't it right I think he
35:27 managed to talk about graze mantis
35:29 reptilian and the humanoids the
35:32 humanoids is very interesting for those
35:33 of you who ever watched Westworld I did
35:36 not know until season two but one of the
35:37 women in the show is a fairly main
35:40 character was Elon Musk's ex-wife as I
35:43 am told and she has eyes that are fairly
35:46 far apart inside of her skull and
35:48 there's people from the Netherlands that
35:53 have these skulls and they are now being
35:58 pinpointed because someone said oh
36:00 aren't they a weird species of
36:01 subspecies or whatever sect of you know
36:04 humanity and let's just point a finger
36:07 at them and say they're aliens
36:08 you know what stops them from pointing
36:11 at Aborigines in Australia and saying
36:13 the same thing because they're very
36:15 unique gene pool they look very
36:16 different from all the people in Africa
36:18 they have their own thing by the way
36:22 just as a digression I watched some
36:23 interview with a woman when I was on
36:27 Facebook or something maybe some of you
36:28 guys saw us it was an Aborigines woman
36:30 who didn't didn't discover modern
36:31 society until she was 15 and the
36:34 interview was all conducted in her
36:35 native Aborigine language and my god
36:39 this language is wild it's beautiful
36:43 like she sings probably a third of the
36:46 time while she's talking it's how they
36:49 do it I guess I've never seen this
36:51 before but she'd start singing and I'm
36:54 like whoa and she's talking and then
36:55 she'd stop and it's just it is the most
36:59 alien language I've ever heard it's very
37:01 interesting very beautiful in its way
37:03 its own way so what's the problem with
37:07 you know religion and the alien UFO G
37:11 group cross pollinating these story arcs
37:14 with the subjects that may or may not be
37:17 actually being abducted because if
37:20 someone comes in to dr. Jacobs office
37:22 two day if I came in and told him my
37:24 story about you
37:25 I was 21 years old some alien woke me up
37:28 he's like are you gonna be okay I said I
37:30 guess and then he said well it you know
37:32 I said but no one's gonna believe me and
37:34 he says what would make them believe you
37:36 and I said I don't know and he reaches
37:37 down shows me a president I'm pretty
37:39 sure as an LP he says this is where got
37:40 me paper I go to sleep I wake up at 1 to
37:42 0-0 in bed I get up I go out there I
37:46 touch it it's freaking soft and I tell
37:48 my girlfriend and she's looking at me
37:50 all pissed off because he was right
37:52 never seen an origami paper in my life
37:54 had you held a gun to my head I would
37:56 have thought it was solid color paper 8
37:59 by 11 aspect ratio it's not it's
38:02 perfectly square and it's only covered
38:04 on one side which makes it even more
38:05 difficult to fold that [ __ ] because all
38:07 the white has to be hidden on the inside
38:08 of the object didn't know but there you
38:12 go I'm reading her mind or whatever and
38:14 I'm reading the book communion by at
38:16 least Reber at the time when last like
38:18 15 pages of the book before I went to
38:20 bed that night all right so I go talk to
38:25 dr. Jacobson and we're gonna do this
38:26 regression through hypnosis is he going
38:31 to tell me that I'm chosen maybe and if
38:36 he does he pollutes the sociological
38:38 experiment of me which is really a
38:41 psychological participation it's it's at
38:43 a personal level that affects then the
38:45 group think of how I perceive myself in
38:47 society as a person who may have been
38:49 visited by greys hmm I think that's
38:54 dangerous
38:54 and I think that's irresponsible and
38:55 perhaps he does not do that I'm not
38:57 accusing him of doing that but would
38:59 semen his post interviews which I
39:01 watched three and a half hours of again
39:03 highly repetitive stuff which is
39:05 actually kind of good that he's not
39:06 changing his story and embellishing you
39:08 further and further each time that he's
39:10 interviewed but I think that it will
39:15 distract us from trying to figure out
39:18 who these folks are where they're from
39:20 any logical questions that we posed in
39:22 the last episode right again if you
39:25 capture a grey alien why does Bob Lazar
39:27 have to start from Ground Zero on these
39:30 antimatter engines that are below deck
39:34 even if the pilot doesn't know
39:36 everything about how his ship is built
39:38 he's least going to know
39:38 the basics and supposedly I didn't get
39:42 into it but supposedly in when a bob
39:43 lazar as last 45-minute interviews out
39:45 of podium before he disappeared a second
39:47 time he said that there's an element
39:50 that I believe is in the 160s like 161
39:53 or something that we don't have on our
39:54 periodic table it's a metal but if you
39:57 even have a tiny sliver of this metal
39:58 you energize it with electricity and it
40:00 creates a gigantic field around it which
40:03 then enables the ship to basically fly
40:06 through zero ether model according to
40:12 his initial antimatter story there's
40:14 three antimatter engines hanging and a
40:15 triangle underneath the ship and that
40:17 they sway they lean and tilt and out of
40:21 the base of the units using antimatter
40:22 because that sounds super [ __ ] sci-fi
40:26 it creates a big bubble of no ether and
40:29 then your ship basically falls into the
40:30 hole because ether is the only thing
40:32 holding it in place in the first place
40:34 and then you can achieve pretty much I
40:35 would imagine instantaneous travel
40:37 anywhere in the universe so why these
40:39 grace if that engine exists couldn't
40:41 come and pick up their buddies it would
40:43 only be because the GPS system wasn't
40:45 reporting back home where they went like
40:47 they're little they're little Magellan's
40:49 running around and you know stopping off
40:52 their teasers if you were to be a
40:54 Douglas Adams fan rich kids stopping off
40:57 at planets to using farmers but now
41:02 let's go a little bit darker into this
41:04 because they're the one thing that
41:08 really super got into in his book
41:09 majestic which concerns me back then
41:12 when I was 20 years old reading this
41:14 book probably even nineteen if the book
41:17 is filed under the nonfiction area I
41:20 don't know if you can get a copy of it
41:21 anymore used to be five bucks I got at a
41:23 grocery store because I had a
41:24 silver-gray alien on the front and the
41:27 Roswell crash in the background just a
41:29 little illustration in foil which is
41:32 actually pretty cool wish I still had a
41:34 copy of the book but the book starts
41:35 that he was invited to a derelict motel
41:38 in the middle of the desert a gentleman
41:40 who was part of the project Bluebook
41:42 slash project majestic is talking to him
41:44 and telling him that this was real I was
41:47 part of it and the society needs to know
41:49 so I'm going to tell you and you're
41:50 gonna write this book and the autopsy
41:52 report
41:52 being I you know give you those indented
41:54 oh it's all on the book it's beautifully
41:59 done regardless if it's true or not it
42:01 is beautifully done so hats off to
42:03 Wiggly streamers ability to really write
42:06 well you know I've seen interviews with
42:10 him it's since he doesn't convince me at
42:12 all right he says that you can go to his
42:15 house in upstate New York and see these
42:18 things fly even has some videos of some
42:20 lights flying in the sky down in from
42:21 his house but he says he got abducted so
42:24 much that he could have put a
42:25 surveillance camera and been filming
42:27 this I mean you could have gotten a
42:28 piece off of them and a bunch of stuff
42:30 right but in majestic towards the end of
42:33 the book he starts talking about
42:34 abductions that are happening all over
42:37 belief Texas of women losing their
42:42 babies from their wombs obviously in his
42:45 story they're being stolen by these
42:47 creatures and then raised but the other
42:50 one is that kids are disappearing and
42:52 that people are disappearing and then
42:53 all these people on your milk cartons or
42:55 a large percentage of them are simply
42:57 being abducted by aliens and not
42:59 pedophilia based human traffickers that
43:02 are now running various political and
43:06 intelligence organizations right and
43:09 banking and royalty so what does that do
43:14 that expunges their association with
43:17 this situation thus giving us no means
43:21 of ever finding the folks that are
43:22 really doing it we we have a child that
43:24 goes missing in our neighborhood and
43:26 it's just a great a lien that's doing it
43:27 or some hybrid or something like that I
43:29 think that is potentially without severe
43:34 evidence and proof probably one of the
43:37 most irresponsible things in this day
43:40 and age with what we know today with
43:42 human trafficking to suggest now that
43:45 wasn't the case back in the 80s you
43:46 didn't have a lot of knowledge of this
43:48 stuff without the internet and that's
43:49 revealed a lot of things albeit probably
43:53 a ton of it untrue about certain people
43:55 doing certain things but what if this is
43:59 a big cover story
44:02 unbeknownst to dr. Jacobs
44:04 unbeknownst to Whitley Strieber these
44:06 individuals are abducting human beings
44:09 and doing away with them
44:11 the Podesta brothers and sigmund freud's
44:17 was at nephews or grant great-grandsons
44:19 house go look that one up I don't know
44:25 what happened I'm just telling you a lot
44:26 of those like there's a great breadcrumb
44:29 trail on that one just look up Podesta
44:33 Freud like this Sigmund Freud and child
44:39 kidnapping and you're gonna get the
44:41 story that you need to dive in to do it
44:43 on do it on YouTube because I believe
44:45 it's the sgt channel which i don't
44:47 completely endorse anything that they
44:49 say but they did a great job looking
44:51 into this okay so that concerns me
44:56 another interesting thing that jacob
44:58 said was that these people are being
44:59 abducted all over new york city and and
45:01 just tons of them during the day they're
45:03 inside their apartments on the perhaps
45:06 you know eighth floor of a 40-story
45:09 complex where people live and they're
45:11 being sucked through the ceiling and
45:13 they're you know so the the physical
45:15 abduction that whitley strieber holds to
45:18 which is that they come to his house he
45:20 identifies three species of aliens the
45:23 tall beige alien which is the female
45:25 gray the shorter silver one which is the
45:27 male gray and then these blue like
45:32 really stocky guys that have super round
45:34 eyeballs they have a helmet on that
45:36 looks like a world war two helmet from
45:37 the US and they fill up the entire house
45:40 pick you up from bed and they they
45:43 basically give you a crowd surfing
45:44 experience until they bring you outside
45:46 put him on his patio Anto this the sort
45:49 of loungy chair made out of a stretched
45:51 piece of blue material and he secured
45:54 into that and then that is lifted up and
45:56 pushed up into the spaceship now why go
46:00 to all that effort i mean god you got
46:02 the guy in this was that the 60s or 70s
46:05 that was hiking and he just flew up just
46:07 like a normal old sci-fi movie from the
46:10 50s but now they apparently have like
46:14 enterprise teleportation capabilities
46:17 it's interesting how that all evolves
46:19 right
46:20 Star Trek does force for shows that have
46:23 enterprise you know transportation the
46:25 one in the 60s and all of a sudden the
46:27 stories and them people that are
46:29 hypnotized start to evolve with the
46:32 technology that they can conceive of
46:34 wholeheartedly
46:35 he tells an elaborate story about a
46:37 mother who was getting abducted so much
46:41 that her problem was is that she would
46:46 never show up to events so she wouldn't
46:51 be at school with her kids like she
46:56 would drop her kids off and she had a
46:57 special-needs child and they would call
47:02 her routinely so you got to pick up your
47:03 kid early they're having an episode
47:05 they're having some issues and she would
47:07 be abducted and not available and
47:10 therefore she might lose the custody of
47:12 her child
47:13 well what archetype of religion does
47:16 that appeal to in my opinion what does
47:20 an evangelical Christian and I keep
47:22 going for that but and what does the
47:23 average Christian who comes to your
47:24 house trying to get you to do we're
47:26 trying to get you to convert to their
47:27 church through a baptism again your
47:30 baptism sucks their baptism is good
47:32 there's always some ridiculous ration
47:34 out of that okay but why because God has
47:40 set up the world to extort salvation
47:42 through man because he's such a smart
47:45 God right again back in the I can't
47:51 remember what year was he goes the
47:53 Michelangelo days the Vatican
47:55 commissions a painting where Jesus
47:57 Christ is handing a key to the Pope they
47:59 built a little building onto the edge of
48:00 the Vatican it's a little 10 by 10 room
48:03 in there's a gigantic painting of this
48:05 event occurring they then tell everyone
48:07 from Rome in Europe to come look at this
48:09 painting because it is the de facto
48:10 moment when Christ and viewed the Pope
48:12 to be better than you and you need to
48:15 come see this because if you don't
48:16 you're not going to believe it
48:17 and back in those days it was illegal
48:19 under Roman law / Vatican law to paint
48:22 photo real human beings because they
48:24 knew no one had ever seen anything photo
48:27 real that is like ultimate
48:28 CGT for their era and if you saw photo
48:30 real you believe that as a real event
48:32 and so you walk through you saw this you
48:34 believed it then you left the miles the
48:36 sorry the line that was out there
48:37 according to sister Wendy who had her
48:40 art appreciation show in the 90s was
48:43 that the line was 11 miles long
48:46 brainwashing brainwashing a paradigm of
48:50 superiority of man over man because then
48:54 allows the total pedophile organization
48:57 which is the Catholic Church to continue
48:59 doing what they do how could V need if
49:03 the hypnotist and the urologist and the
49:05 people who get involved with this
49:06 movement start to peddle this notion
49:09 that the aliens are upon us they're
49:11 messing with us and hey maybe they are
49:14 then you're gonna have to go to those
49:16 hypnotic people those hypnotists and the
49:19 people who are experts in MUFON all
49:20 these organizations to find out what
49:22 your next possible move could possibly
49:24 be because if you don't write you your
49:29 child could be abducted you will be
49:30 abducted if you're one of the chosen
49:32 ones well then you're the ambassador to
49:35 these folks to get something done here's
49:39 what I don't understand just like the
49:41 twilight zone back in the day the great
49:43 frisbee if you haven't seen this episode
49:46 it's fantastic it's a it's the one that
49:48 jerked your vase used to create his
49:50 mover movie about something like why
49:54 would I lie or no that's a different
49:56 movie but it's not liar liar a liar
49:58 which is Jim Carrey but it was a movie
50:00 that Richter vase did the guy invented
50:01 office the essentially no one in the
50:06 world knew how to lie and he was the
50:08 first person to figure out how to do it
50:09 and so he would run around to hot women
50:12 and say you know I've got this medical
50:13 condition if you don't have sex with me
50:15 right now I'm gonna die even they would
50:16 go in the hotel room and have sex with
50:18 them but the great frisbee is also where
50:21 you get Mars attack from but it's a it's
50:24 a it starts out in a little hardware
50:27 store with this big fat guy amazing
50:30 actor with all these other amazing
50:31 actors around him and he's telling tall
50:33 tales and they all go there to his
50:35 hardware store to hear him say these
50:37 tall tales he says he has 30 degrees
50:39 from you know
50:41 a bunch of different universities he
50:43 invented rockets anything you mentioned
50:45 he invented it he was the first guy to
50:46 break the sound barrier pop up up a BA
50:48 and on one occasion these two aliens
50:53 pull up in a very humanoid they pull up
50:57 and new gasoline for their car and he
50:59 comes outside and says oh yeah this this
51:01 whole car yeah I I actually invented the
51:04 engine for this car and I vented this
51:05 car in general and they're like really
51:07 really Wow
51:08 and so he keeps going on about all these
51:11 things he's invited in they're just
51:12 their eyeballs are getting huge or just
51:13 like oh my god this guy's the smartest
51:15 human being we've ever found so later
51:17 that night they abduct him and they're
51:19 using the set from Forbidden Planet 1956
51:22 Leslie Nielsen and he goes in there and
51:25 he realizes they're saying they're
51:27 aliens and they look human so he's like
51:29 yeah whatever and he said we're about to
51:31 take off we're gonna take you back to
51:32 our planet and you can share all of your
51:34 knowledge because you're the smartest
51:35 person we've ever met on any planet ever
51:37 and he's like wait a minute wait a
51:39 minute you haven't figured out that I'm
51:40 a liar that this is just a thing I do
51:43 with my friends and they're like whoa
51:44 what's a lie he says well I don't tell
51:46 the truth I make things up and they
51:48 can't conceive of a lie but so they
51:51 don't believe him and so they try to
51:52 hold him in there he punches one in the
51:55 face and all sudden their human face
51:57 breaks off and they have an alien face
51:58 underneath he's like oh my god he passes
52:00 out so they put him in a little holding
52:03 cell they haven't quite taken off yet
52:05 they come in to try to give him some
52:07 food I think they try to calm him down
52:09 and he's like well do you mind if I play
52:11 my harmonica because it sort of calms me
52:13 down and I'm really nervous right now
52:14 and they kasher what is that he pulls
52:16 out their harmonica plays a note and
52:18 they I can't play it for [ __ ] and they
52:20 all start dying and he's like oh my god
52:23 this is my weapon maybe you've seen Mars
52:25 attack knows that I think it was was a
52:29 Roy Orbison song I think whatever the
52:31 song was it killed all the aliens that
52:34 were coming to get us right so taken
52:37 right out of a Twilight Zone the reason
52:40 why I mentioned that episode is the
52:41 following why would aliens be here
52:46 dragging out average individuals telling
52:49 them their plan of this special event
52:51 that's going to occur cuz that's what
52:53 they're all starting to say
52:55 special event is coming but they won't
52:57 tell you what it is well why wouldn't
52:59 they abduct a Carl Sagan kind of guy one
53:03 of you maybe me we're pretty good
53:05 thinkers aren't we if you could you
53:08 could tell us and we would actually
53:09 become an ambassador between them and us
53:12 right if they are in cahoots with the
53:15 military the net sort of negates all
53:17 this communication with average human
53:19 beings why would they be trying to
53:21 infiltrate apartments because Jacobs was
53:24 trying to tell us that you know again
53:25 people have been sequestered in their
53:28 apartments they're not allowed to say
53:29 but they have two hybrid aliens living
53:31 in their apartment that completely goes
53:33 against all this communication that
53:35 supposedly Bob Lazar talked about where
53:37 we have all these alien vehicles there's
53:40 the old man that gave the testimony with
53:42 the oxygen tank and his nose at the
53:45 hotel saying that he worked for
53:49 Eisenhower and Eisenhower was like I
53:52 want to know what's an area 51 and they
53:53 kept denying him so he was sent to area
53:55 51 because he had the special clearance
53:57 and he met greys and that they were very
54:00 cordial and and there was no sign of
54:02 threat or anything and that through
54:05 communication of him observing and
54:07 taking it back to Eisenhower Eisenhower
54:10 was like okay I don't need to go sounds
54:13 like [ __ ] to me but whatever
54:15 now let's disengage from the seriousness
54:19 of this subject
54:20 and let's go for it's entertainment
54:21 quality its fascination quality perhaps
54:25 is critical thinking quality because I
54:28 think it's there there's a lot of us
54:31 that believe wholeheartedly through
54:33 either talking to people from NASA in my
54:34 case that we didn't go to the moon
54:37 there's not a fiber in my body that
54:39 thinks we went to the moon
54:40 I think Buzz Aldrin just gave another
54:43 interview where he's talking to an
54:45 eight-year-old girl and he says we
54:46 didn't go and I think we should figure
54:48 out why we didn't go and pop up up a ba
54:50 and he basically admits it on camera now
54:52 someone could have fudged with the audio
54:54 to put Eden on end of did but it doesn't
54:58 explain the rest of his conversation
55:00 which was very detailed which is based
55:02 on Eden we didn't go sometimes you need
55:06 things to jostle your mind so
55:09 that you can get to a point of critical
55:11 thinking if you're like me back in the
55:15 day when you heard about this alien
55:18 thing and alien abductions and any
55:20 fairly well produced alien information
55:25 video from the sci-fi channel as soon as
55:28 you push play on the playhead of one of
55:30 these things you start to you start to
55:36 sort of disengage your brain and you
55:39 open it up and you get this kind of
55:40 adrenaline feeling of like oh my god
55:42 this is gonna be something new this is
55:43 amazing I want to be blown away and so
55:46 you're not typically in a skeptic
55:50 mindset if you are Pro UFO and think
55:55 about why I mean is life that exciting
55:57 it would surpass and typical form an
56:01 alien showing up for those of you
56:04 haven't had kids let me just tell you
56:06 and for those of you have you'll totally
56:07 get this analogy when you see your kid
56:11 whether you be the mother giving birth
56:13 or the father staring down at the birth
56:16 like I've said in several episodes God
56:19 shows up to pay you a visit and there's
56:22 something magical that occurs the the
56:24 significance of your responsibility
56:26 shows up and it's usually a euphoric
56:28 thing as much as you might have been
56:29 worried before God shows up and says
56:32 this is alright hopefully you have the
56:36 all positive experience that I had I
56:38 think when we hear about things in the
56:42 alien realm there's an entertainment
56:44 quality to it that is almost like that
56:46 it is you are perceiving you know you're
56:48 letting the information come in the more
56:51 beautiful someone has created graphics
56:52 or sifted through the archives of photos
56:55 you go with the flow it's interesting to
56:58 you you don't have the discernment that
57:02 I think you need there's this big push
57:07 based on the receptionist of Wernher von
57:09 Braun in the late 70s again I think he
57:11 passed in 1978 supposedly one of his
57:15 last cautions to his secretary who's a
57:19 very interesting woman to say the least
57:20 he said they are
57:22 to attempt an alien invasion storyline
57:25 to unify the world under one world
57:27 government Ronald Reagan has the famous
57:30 speech where he talks about that exact
57:31 thing and everyone said he went off
57:32 script and he wasn't reading from the
57:34 speech he was supposed to be reading and
57:35 that they said do not mention this weird
57:37 idea you have of this alien invasion hmm
57:40 I'm not convinced it was a written down
57:42 for him it is an interesting notion if
57:44 we did have an alien invasion of some
57:47 sort be it good or bad a humanity is
57:48 going to probably set aside a lot of its
57:51 differences maybe now what if one of the
57:55 religions is very terrified of the
57:57 notion of the alien invasion disrupting
58:01 their control over their people and so
58:02 they go Double Down against the alien
58:04 thing and then they just basically try
58:06 to launch rockets into space and then we
58:08 have half the humanity trying to hurt
58:10 these folks the other half going hey man
58:12 you want to eat dinner with us we're
58:13 gonna have sloppy joes you should try
58:15 sloppy joes I know your mouth is pretty
58:17 small we'll make little tiny burgers of
58:18 it right the thing is is if we don't
58:21 start applying a lot more skepticism to
58:25 the information that we already have
58:26 like Hugh says you know a lot more than
58:28 you know you have a lot more than you
58:30 know I think that's true in all rooms
58:35 again I believe every man woman and
58:37 child is born with right or wrong inside
58:39 their soul and I am not convinced at all
58:42 that anyone loses that quality despite
58:45 their own delusions and their own
58:47 mechanisms to try to subdue that so they
58:49 can gain riches the amount of people I
58:51 have met who are worth a hundred million
58:55 dollars or more who engage in really
58:59 shitty business tactics they almost make
59:01 it their lot in life to step on a head
59:03 to get ahead as a contest they know they
59:06 know that they are wrong and they live a
59:09 a torturous life as much as they might
59:11 paint a smile on their face the only
59:14 thing that might disrupt that theory is
59:17 someone who is extremely uneducated
59:18 being blessed with a lot of wealth they
59:22 simply never really gain an empathetic
59:24 bone you never know right
59:26 the best way to understand God in my
59:28 opinion is to remove all organized
59:31 religion away from God and start to
59:33 close your eyes feel God feel the
59:35 meditation under
59:36 and that the intangible feelings that
59:39 you have around your existence is the
59:41 fabric of God and the body that you're
59:44 merely temporarily owning and the world
59:46 that you're temporarily interacting with
59:47 is merely an instance of what your soul
59:50 could possibly do restricted only by
59:52 your body in this world when we dream we
59:56 get pure proof that there is an infinite
60:00 world out there that simply creates
60:02 itself by the frustum of what you're
60:04 viewing right the world exists as you
60:06 look at it and everything behind you
60:07 disappears if you walked out of a
60:11 gingerbread house and one of your dreams
60:13 and you turned around and looked at it
60:14 you're like wow that's a gingerbread
60:15 house this is crazy and then you turned
60:17 and looked over the wilderness made of
60:19 all kinds of jujubes and all kinds of
60:21 things and then you turn back to look at
60:22 the house it's gonna be different does
60:24 your brain ditches it as soon as you
60:27 don't see it and then when it tries to
60:29 reconstruct it it's like okay what do we
60:30 do again you know it won't be the same
60:33 that's how you figure out you're in a
60:34 dream that is sort of and it's all
60:39 photo-real right I mean it's amazing you
60:41 don't have any degrees in computer
60:43 graphics but man your brain is an
60:45 amazing rendering engine your soul
60:47 wherever the hell we are when we dream
60:49 it is probably safe to say that if there
60:53 are aliens like the ones in Roswell
60:56 people from another place that they are
61:00 in the same ecosystem of birth death and
61:04 maybe reincarnation that we're in they
61:08 have a beginning middle and end perhaps
61:10 their middle is a lot longer than our
61:11 middle perhaps are like elfs right they
61:13 live to be 200 300 years old who knows
61:18 one of the interesting things you'll
61:20 find with technical people who lie is
61:22 that their lies are only built out of
61:23 technical facts it's very rarely built
61:27 out of the metaphysical facts about what
61:30 an alien was thinking and feeling that's
61:33 one reason why I like Jesse Marcel's
61:35 seniors very late testimony out in the
61:38 desert walking around sobbing a little
61:40 bit or near sobbing where he is saying I
61:44 was here he was here he was telling me
61:47 you know I can sense this despair and
61:49 and he was feeling that despair in the
61:51 interview like I just said in the
61:52 previous episode that's one of the first
61:56 times I've ever really heard anyone get
61:59 into the metaphysics of what these
62:00 beings think now if you read communion
62:01 by Whitley Strieber he puts forth a very
62:04 sterile view of them and that I think is
62:09 a very logical leap that he was saying I
62:13 don't want you to abduct me I don't want
62:15 you to and he's all into the anal
62:16 probing and stuff which is a lot of you
62:18 apologists are like please give that a
62:20 rest right again like I've said in many
62:24 alien episodes there is nothing to be
62:26 found in the colon of a human being that
62:30 could not be found in a follicle of hair
62:32 there's no need if they are advanced
62:35 that be some active total perversion and
62:38 not one of any scientific quality right
62:40 now the other notion that is very common
62:43 in the stories of of aliens and it's
62:47 portrayed and religion in one way or
62:49 another now that there's a very few
62:51 folks in religion that really go to this
62:53 level but I've met plenty of them and
62:55 the story goes like this
62:59 yeah especially planet-x people right
63:02 there's somehow earth and it's it's
63:05 beautiful blue marble third Rock from
63:07 the Sun heliocentric model has something
63:10 on it that is very rare like gold gold
63:13 is typically in these stories and it's
63:15 just laughable okay aliens are here to
63:18 turn us into a slave colony to mine gold
63:20 and it's going to be used in the
63:23 atmosphere of Nibiru because they need
63:26 it to save their planet right all that
63:28 plan X crap came and went it's all
63:29 [ __ ] right but somehow these aliens
63:32 are here to abduct us turn us into
63:34 slaves and have us farm something for
63:36 them they have the ability to travel
63:39 interstellar Li the tons of what we
63:42 might safely assume is the majority of
63:45 planets in this universe would be
63:46 uninhabited on mind and you would
63:51 imagine that if they have the ability to
63:53 teleport us out of a hotel room in New
63:55 York City or something but they could
63:57 teleport gold straight out of the ground
63:59 and a mother lode yeah it's right down
64:01 there you know 100 feet
64:03 there's a piece the size of the state of
64:06 California we're just gonna be man out
64:08 of the ground we have to worry about
64:10 hurting anyone who have to get into any
64:12 dispute with a local military or
64:14 anything I could just get it off of a
64:16 bunch of planets but then again that's
64:17 not romantic that is not a story out of
64:19 the Bible that is not a story out of the
64:21 lore of aliens and so that story's never
64:23 told the one where a man suffers that's
64:26 like oh my gosh I better listen Moore's
64:28 a Whitley Strieber because if I don't
64:30 listen to him I might die let's buy all
64:34 of his books right and I'm picking on
64:39 him a little bit but he doesn't he
64:41 doesn't assert those kind of things and
64:42 I know it but I mean he has his own
64:43 thing I believe in transformation that's
64:48 a bit like that you know like they're
64:50 they have this evil agenda we better all
64:52 get together really soon right
64:56 what does it religion try to do
64:58 consolidate the population under one
65:00 roof
65:01 one authority one man because again man
65:05 God excuse me has chosen to give it to
65:09 one of the most evil organizations to
65:10 ever exist because God believes that the
65:12 children of this world should be
65:13 sodomized by old men that might sound
65:17 extreme but that is actually the facts
65:21 well at the same pace you would reject
65:24 that organization from having some
65:26 dominant role over you hopefully you
65:29 would do that to anyone pawning off
65:30 similar archetypes and story on the
65:33 alien side the subject fascinates me if
65:38 has needs to be from two realms as of
65:43 2018 July or August I should say I have
65:47 a distinct belief an overwhelming belief
65:51 that these greys did make it to Earth in
65:54 1947 five years ago I would have laughed
65:58 hearing myself say that because I hadn't
66:01 done my research now I'm pretty
66:04 convinced again the only thing that
66:07 negates that belief for me is if somehow
66:10 and 47 without MKULTRA being really
66:13 taken to the next level the Manchurian
66:15 stuffin who knows what the Nazis were
66:17 able to do or whatever secret
66:18 organization they could blame it on this
66:21 somehow they convinced the whole town
66:22 it's a military town maybe but this was
66:25 all true but it wasn't sounds like a lot
66:29 of work sounds like they were able to
66:31 kick it all off on one day that sounds
66:33 less and less like a Manchurian
66:35 Candidate right would you put a whole
66:37 town of sleep for six months get
66:39 everyone programmed like dark city and
66:40 then wake them all up and say on this
66:42 day flying saucer oh but it wasn't
66:44 Flying Saucer it was a weather balloon
66:47 people were murdered who just simply saw
66:51 these creatures these beings these
66:54 people shouldn't call them creatures if
66:57 God were this wrathful childish creature
67:00 which are being that which I believe he
67:02 is absolutely not I say he for the lack
67:05 of a better gender right then I'm not
67:09 sure what mankind would do to get close
67:12 to God because there's tons of religions
67:16 on this planet you're gonna have to pick
67:17 one within every religion there's a it's
67:20 almost like an infinite chard or
67:22 hologram you break it and there's a
67:23 bunch of copies of it so which one do
67:25 you pick and then if you pick the wrong
67:27 one you go to heaven and you go to that
67:29 pearly gate and they go up sorry you
67:30 picked the wrong one take the escalator
67:33 down the elevator down to hell right
67:37 yeah that's God yeah
67:41 well if you buy anything after 47 all
67:45 these other stories again most of them
67:48 don't actually inform you about any
67:49 intent their various sightings outside
67:52 of British Air Force bases there's all
67:55 this footage of supposedly craft being
67:59 chased by you know Russian Air Force the
68:02 South American Air Force European Air
68:04 Force all this other stuff seems like
68:08 there's something out there seems like
68:09 they have different models of their
68:10 ships if that's any that stuff is true
68:13 again with the advent of computer
68:15 graphics and art students that need to
68:17 graduate you are getting a plethora of
68:20 fake footage which is stunning to watch
68:22 okay but those with educated eyes can go
68:25 oh I see how you did that right because
68:27 there's flaws and all those pieces of
68:28 footage right
68:29 we just had a thing that pop through I
68:32 think a bunch of press I found it on Fox
68:35 News I posted it on the locked Facebook
68:37 group which was a supposedly a bizarre
68:40 creature that was stalking a moose out
68:42 in the wilderness and one of our
68:43 listeners Kaz he figured out it was just
68:48 something on the windshield the guy was
68:50 filming the moose through the windshield
68:52 and there was a bug that had been
68:54 squished on the windshield or something
68:55 on the windshield and as he tracked the
68:57 you know the camera the the thing that
69:00 was supposedly coming up on the moose
69:02 would track at a slightly parallax
69:06 acceleration which if you're if you're
69:08 good with eyes he figured it out right
69:10 away I did not figure it out right away
69:11 once he told me that's something on the
69:13 windshield boom you see it it's no
69:15 longer a monster it's no longer stalking
69:17 this Bing but my god what if that was
69:19 shown in like the 40s or 50s I mean that
69:23 that could have been an eight millimeter
69:25 camera and a car filmed through a
69:28 windshield
69:28 no one has CG background no one has
69:30 parallaxing knowledge because they
69:31 haven't made their own little video or
69:33 whatever and that would go over as truth
69:36 that's how easy it is right now we do
69:40 have a lot of families that have
69:42 experienced was probably covert aircraft
69:46 maybe they've experienced some aliens
69:47 and they were exposed to radiation some
69:51 people got really hurt by the radiation
69:53 like literally burned like the
69:55 fictitious character and Close
69:57 Encounters of the Third Kind which is
69:58 where I think these stories come from
69:59 the writers are brilliant to cannibalize
70:01 events that have been claimed to have
70:02 happened and so maybe those are true I'm
70:06 not trying to discount any that kind of
70:08 stuff I don't have enough information I
70:10 think that some of the pictures that
70:12 they've drawn are a little silly right
70:14 they'll draw spacecraft with people
70:16 inside windows and once you start doing
70:18 some math of like where their feet would
70:19 be where their head would be where their
70:21 propulsion system would exist where a
70:24 bathroom would exist the sleeping
70:25 quarters it doesn't make any sense right
70:30 and then of course there's the obvious
70:32 question of if they have the capability
70:34 of traveling interstellar Li I'm gonna
70:37 assume that they're pretty intelligent
70:38 and if they want to be seen they will be
70:40 seen and they do not want to be seen
70:41 they cannot be
70:42 see if you can disrupt ether around your
70:47 ship then you can create the same effect
70:51 as a plasma ball which is what a lot of
70:54 things are you know the plasma leaks out
70:56 of the the Earth's crust
70:59 especially in mountainous areas where
71:01 people don't live these plasma balls
71:04 during the day pop out and they're
71:06 spinning they're spinning ball of plasma
71:07 energy they reflect to all lights
71:10 because light cannot penetrate plasma
71:12 that means it looks silvery that's going
71:15 to reflect you know the the ground
71:17 towards the top the sky towards the
71:19 bottom and they're going to find
71:22 different pockets of electrical charge
71:23 in the atmosphere and there's nothing
71:25 that's going to stop plasma from
71:27 traveling twenty thousand miles on one
71:29 direction stopping at the next pocket of
71:31 energy where it can stabilize again and
71:34 then pop out as soon as the atmosphere
71:35 moves the military's hitting them with
71:37 radar going oh my god we have all these
71:39 you know bogeys up there their UFOs
71:42 they're not friend they're not foe we
71:43 don't know what they are at night those
71:46 would glow like light and so a lot of
71:48 the lights you see over Arizona and what
71:50 have you or there's a big string of
71:52 lights flying everyone's videotaping
71:54 this and they go out one by one boom
71:56 boom boom boom well a plasma ball is
71:58 going to have a finite amount of life
72:00 before it decides to either vaporize or
72:03 join the atmosphere in its composition
72:05 for all we know it just simply vanishes
72:09 in some einstein-rosen bridge thing and
72:11 just goes Boop and it's back to some
72:13 dimension that we is not visible by the
72:15 human eye now have we had we're you know
72:19 Foo Fighters over Los Angeles yes we
72:21 have we had some weird crap over the
72:23 Capitol building in Washington DC yes
72:26 did that seem like it was you know the
72:31 one in Los Angeles don't know they hit
72:33 it with a bunch of lights is a beautiful
72:35 photograph of it and then the ones in
72:36 Washington DC it's usually likened to
72:40 something saying here I'm not your head
72:42 of state you know your sovereign country
72:45 which is the District of Columbia which
72:48 should be disband as soon as we gain
72:50 control this country
72:54 we can't have a country inside of our
72:56 country people that is just an IQ test
72:59 we have been failing since the beginning
73:01 but it would seem that they're
73:05 communicating with the authorities again
73:08 then why infiltrate poor people in New
73:10 York and their apartments why even hint
73:13 that something great is coming is that
73:15 some satiating comment to say don't
73:19 resist because everything grates coming
73:21 but we can't tell you right those of you
73:24 who watched the twilight zone to serve
73:25 man will deeply understand where that
73:28 could go wrong right I wanted to throw
73:31 this episode out there so that you guys
73:32 can start seeing the correlations
73:34 between organized religion and the
73:36 archetypes that have existed for
73:37 thousands of years right you know again
73:40 the story of Christ is somewhere in the
73:43 low 20s I've I've had researchers tell
73:47 me it's the 23rd time it's been told I
73:49 have another close friend of mine here
73:50 and Huntington Beach who did a deep dive
73:52 he says and he's a man in his late 60s
73:55 he's an engineer he's a very brilliant
73:57 guy and he says I found 26 versions of
73:59 that when I wrote this film kou :
74:02 it's 2,500 BC and it's the virgin birth
74:05 thing when you study Egyptology you'll
74:07 find Isis and Horus having a virgin
74:11 birth child there's even a hieroglyph
74:13 that is the virgin birth happening if
74:15 you go back to Queen Semiramis in
74:17 Babylonia you have Semiramis supposedly
74:21 it's a mythical thing you know her
74:23 husband's Nimrod and he's the phallus of
74:25 the obelisk and he impregnates her
74:28 through sunrays she has the child
74:31 damos you know nothing removes the
74:36 statues that exist of Queen Semiramis
74:39 holding her child and it looks like Mary
74:41 holding Jesus their exact replicas of
74:44 each other thousands of years before
74:46 this other idea came around so man has
74:50 this need to entertain himself to use
74:53 metaphor and analogy to educate men you
74:57 know I was at a Mormon Church the other
75:00 day and they come to my house you know
75:03 they asked me to come to church and I
75:04 was like sure you're all good people
75:07 see what you see what your church is
75:09 like but I'm sitting down with one of
75:11 the I guess you could call him an elder
75:13 smart guy and I said to him I said well
75:18 you know Jesus taught with analogy
75:21 because he said well you think the Bible
75:22 is allegorical and I said well if Jesus
75:25 teach teaches through parables and
75:27 analogies then why couldn't Jesus
75:28 himself be a parable or an analogy man
75:31 his face was like oh you're right Wow
75:34 never thought about that
75:36 like yeah it doesn't mean it has no
75:38 value it doesn't mean it isn't the right
75:40 way to teach man at this point in time
75:43 how to behave how to reassert the 10
75:47 commandments which I think are sort of
75:49 like the basis of do no harm'
75:51 thinking right the abduction storyline
75:57 claim is one of being captured against
76:02 your will it makes these aliens seem
76:06 evil in some sort of at least one
76:10 perspective or another right Whitley
76:13 Strieber in his book communions said you
76:14 know that he said I don't want you to
76:18 abduct me and he claimed that this gray
76:22 told him it doesn't matter what you want
76:25 we do what we want which is the Nina
76:28 likened it to a scientist performing
76:30 experience experiments excuse me on a
76:32 rat well that's something for us to
76:35 think about right do we do we harm
76:37 animals to advance medication and
76:39 products like lipsticks and makeups for
76:42 humans there's a whole movement in that
76:46 realm right it creates introspection it
76:49 creates critical thinking if you allow
76:51 it so I think there's a value in this
76:54 entire exercise a lot of you know a lot
76:58 about religion you do a lot of you also
77:01 know a lot about these stories of
77:04 abductions aliens you've done deep dives
77:06 for your entire lifetime now your
77:11 homework
77:11 for the comments section is to find
77:15 correlations between religion and alien
77:18 stories that have not been covered in
77:20 this
77:21 or if you want elaborate on something
77:22 where I touched it but I didn't go that
77:24 deep on it please leave your comment
77:26 down below so that we can all kind of
77:28 benefit from your experience as well
77:30 because again this is if you take this
77:33 seriously at all say you're angry with
77:35 me for asserting that this could be
77:36 anything other than what these people
77:37 have said fine that's cool give me your
77:41 opinion in the comments because
77:42 everyone's gonna benefit from your your
77:44 take on this anyway I think you feel me
77:49 this is way better than the other
77:50 episode I did so when those episodes
77:52 died I almost think well that was divine
77:56 it was divine that these recording
77:58 devices failed to work if you haven't
78:02 been already please go to deep thoughts
78:03 radio com there's the audio of the video
78:05 the LOC Facebook group there's a patreon
78:09 page and again a store that will
78:12 probably breathe life here very soon
78:15 anyhow take care of yourself in someone
78:17 else and I'll see you in the next deep
78:18 thoughts over now
