00:29 what's up ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:32 back to deep thoughts
00:35 on this sort of warmish spring evening
00:43 or morning not sure what I want to talk
00:47 about today like their subjects and then
00:51 there are subjects you know there's
00:53 things you can't I can make a whole show
00:54 out of a subject but then I think it's
00:57 sort of like Stanley Kubrick's will
00:58 comment you know you can make a show out
01:01 of something but it may not be
01:04 interesting you know or it's really
01:07 interesting to a small group of people
01:10 this evening I've just been reflecting
01:12 on sort of the neverending [ __ ] that
01:16 seems to plague I guess the last three
01:21 decades especially with strangers I
01:27 don't remember really you know the ups
01:33 and downs for the least the first two
01:36 decades of my life I don't remember and
01:40 there were things happening especially
01:44 with Vietnam and that kind of stuff but
01:46 you know it's like my parents who all
01:48 were born in the mid 40s mid to late 40s
01:51 I guess they're both my parents are born
01:55 between 46 to 48 okay and you've had
02:00 some scary things which I guess
02:02 relatively speaking definitely sucks you
02:04 think you're safe and your country and
02:06 then all of a sudden they're blowing up
02:07 bombs which are sexy and terrifying all
02:10 at the same time there's the Korean War
02:13 no sooner did we get out of that there
02:15 the 60s was all about just murders oh my
02:19 god killing presidents presidents
02:22 brothers black leaders tons of other
02:26 people that will never know their names
02:29 because they were cleaned out to keep it
02:30 a secret this war is raging bunch of
02:34 protests but here's the thing I think
02:41 what I didn't see at all in the 70s was
02:45 a recession the prayer
02:48 sort of you know boom-and-bust cycle
02:50 thing in the 70s my parents always could
02:52 get jobs eighties same thing it depends
03:00 on where you live of course but my dad
03:04 and eyelids in two different states and
03:06 you had no problem finding work who's
03:08 reliable you just meat potatoes the job
03:12 then I move to California and it's just
03:18 like yeah there's some things that will
03:21 happen to you and you will feel like a
03:23 sort of a the story of Joe we're just
03:26 like geez man I did everything right I
03:29 treated people well but outside
03:32 circumstances poof poof poof you just
03:35 crazy [ __ ] you know if I'm a little
03:39 disjointed in that last sentence still
03:41 right now it's because I got a call I
03:43 apologize the guy was talking about you
03:48 know other than Wars it's interesting
03:49 they used to use Dwarfs which is
03:51 supposed to be like a really good cash
03:53 cow for the country right war economy's
03:57 a good economy I don't even know if
03:58 that's true you know for the entire
04:01 country I'm sure it makes the Carlyle
04:03 Group rich as [ __ ] but I guess the
04:07 sentiment I have is that it's sort of
04:12 one of these things if I fail to say it
04:15 well and then I saw someone who wrote it
04:17 online in a particular way and it's
04:20 there's old adages and stuff that say
04:22 this but it's better to die for freedom
04:27 than to live in a perpetual world of
04:30 tyranny and it's just you know the herd
04:34 mentality is actually seems like it's
04:40 for the first time in history it seems
04:45 like it's mostly about freedom now I
04:48 mean it feels like at least 51% of the
04:52 modern world I can't speak for third
04:54 world because they don't have any room
04:56 connection with any third world
04:58 existence I mean I'm hearing a bunch of
05:00 news out of China
05:01 by god it's like everyone in China
05:03 because of brainwashing and years and
05:08 years under the CCP there there this is
05:12 like a lesson for all the Democrats man
05:14 you a big socialist right they're all
05:16 complaining because they're like my
05:17 government should be taking care of this
05:19 and what's interesting is everyone
05:21 thinks that China has free health care
05:23 and they're now - saying straight phone
05:29 calls from these individuals they
05:31 disguise their voices when they come
05:33 over and that with the garble goop but
05:36 these people are saying that in order to
05:38 get treated for the pandemic thing there
05:42 their pandemic their local pandemic rate
05:44 it's cost seven to eleven thousand
05:47 dollars to get pushed through and get
05:52 treated that would damn near bankrupt -
05:56 any family in the United States unless
05:58 they have a savings unless they go hock
06:00 a car or something right it's so bizarre
06:04 but these boom and bust cycles which in
06:07 my brain you know there was a little
06:10 tiny recession in the 80s but I was in a
06:14 pretty you know I don't know I wouldn't
06:16 say poor town but definitely in town it
06:18 doesn't have like huge businesses but we
06:23 had a lot of businesses going and oil
06:25 was pretty good in the 80s which is what
06:28 my dad was in he was an explosives guy
06:31 he perforated the wells so they could
06:34 pull the oil in you know but by the 90s
06:39 when I first got out here I mean it was
06:42 like late eighties right so I got the
06:43 god I mean I feel like I had
06:46 economically about four years of bliss I
06:51 would say any mistakes that were made
06:53 for just life things that I did wrong or
06:57 you date someone that works out for a
06:59 little while that doesn't work out or
07:00 whatever just normal stuff that you
07:02 can't blame anyone for but yourself or
07:04 just you know the organic nature of life
07:07 but then it was like 93 or so
07:13 several times so they get the whole
07:15 board they get the whole country then
07:18 the internet have lunch obviously
07:20 propped everything up a little longer
07:21 than they normally do but of course they
07:22 have the plan in 2000-2001 and then they
07:28 bring in a bunch of tyranny then they
07:30 got the place again 2002 then they get
07:34 the place again 2008 now they just did
07:37 the ultimate guiding 12 years later and
07:42 so the sentiment I'm seeing is
07:45 protestors for I mean before this
07:49 ridiculous scammed emigrate it's it's
07:53 interesting I just read an article in
07:55 Fox which said they said there's this
08:04 mysterious thing they've discovered in
08:07 New York patience and I'm like oh but
08:10 they had like a white person putting a
08:13 black eye mask on a black guy I thought
08:16 oh here it comes it's gonna say it's
08:18 some racial you know bias because keep
08:21 hearing these it's it's almost like I
08:23 don't know about you guys but when I
08:24 hear this all the chatter around this
08:27 Corona thing it's been someone thinks
08:31 it's racist I mean you'll turn to read
08:34 the article and it's not there you know
08:35 it's like it's killing Asians more than
08:38 anyone else and then you try to find
08:39 that somewhere and it doesn't exist and
08:41 then it was killing blacks more than I
08:43 was killing other people I can't find
08:46 any the data it wasn't about that at all
08:49 they have lied so much about the numbers
08:53 in New York that now they're going to
09:00 create a really bad situation
09:02 mark my words men write this down in
09:05 your brain because they have falsely
09:08 diagnosed so many people as having died
09:12 to Kovan who did not die of kovat they
09:15 were never even tested for Kovan now
09:18 they're gonna write it into the medical
09:20 journals that that if you have these
09:23 other conditions you're really
09:26 susceptible
09:27 kofi and it's like on one level they're
09:30 gonna make a bunch associations that are
09:31 simply untrue because people never had
09:33 it in the first place they died of
09:34 whatever they had - they're gonna make
09:38 ridiculous assertions which is like yeah
09:40 if you're on death's door no matter how
09:42 old you are and you catch something else
09:43 or you have cars man don't get the flu
09:46 either don't get a common cold don't get
09:49 anything pneumonia right this episode is
09:54 gonna be numbered and we'll probably
09:57 make it like a herd mentality episode
10:00 with a great platform to talk about it
10:03 because we're in the middle of this
10:04 whole thing and there's this video
10:09 supposedly was a hot mic at the White
10:12 House or two guys for a brief second or
10:15 on camera one guy had a mask one guy
10:18 didn't have a mask the guy said you know
10:20 you take your mask off there was a bunch
10:23 of like it seems like a scam I don't
10:25 know because the guy said you could take
10:28 your mask off it's okay now and he says
10:31 oh really and then he says this thing
10:33 goes we know they say that there's only
10:34 like 7,000 cases in California and the
10:37 guy goes yeah I think I got this right I
10:39 mean if you got a different please
10:40 educate me I'm not gonna invest any more
10:42 time in the video but because I've seen
10:45 it like four or five times and they just
10:47 said yeah we do they think it was
10:49 actually more like 250,000 or some like
10:51 gigantic number and that everybody had
10:54 it and everyone's okay now like there's
10:56 immunity now but then this other guy and
10:58 they all it's completely off camera
11:00 within us what's second no one's on
11:01 camera anymore so it's like anyone could
11:03 narrate this thing just get voices that
11:05 sound like the guys look in the video
11:08 and you're good one dude's got a mask on
11:11 kind of doesn't sound like he has a mass
11:14 when he talks just another indicator
11:16 this could be a scam and he's like oh
11:18 yeah it's a hoax whole thing's hopes I
11:20 mean one guy goes oh I don't think it's
11:22 a hoax okay have you ever had a
11:28 situation where I know you have let me
11:31 give you let me give you a ridiculous
11:32 analogy and then we can apply it to
11:35 today think back to a time when you had
11:40 a valuable object
11:41 your hand could be a glass literally a
11:45 drinking glass could be some porcelain
11:47 things some glass things some vos
11:49 something could have been your cellphone
11:53 and you're at a pool party and you
11:59 you're grabbing it and you slip and now
12:03 that objects in mid-flight and you're
12:09 like [ __ ] and you're trying to grab the
12:12 thing but because your fighter flight in
12:15 you're not doing a good job and your
12:18 hands oricon right and you just happen
12:20 to bump it again and it flies again now
12:22 sometimes you see these videos we're
12:24 guys you know slipping and something's
12:27 popping around they finally catch it but
12:28 you don't catch it and in slow motion
12:32 you just watch it crash on the ground
12:34 maybe you were a kid when this happened
12:36 you got in trouble it's sort of like
12:39 that scene a risky business with the egg
12:42 all kinds of movies like this but as you
12:45 see it hit the ground there's a
12:49 beautiful metaphor there for freedom
12:52 because what is true about that moment
12:55 when you're breaking something it will
12:59 never ever exist again that thing is
13:04 gone forever whether it be the crack
13:08 down the center of the egg or something
13:11 that truly just shatters into a million
13:13 pieces that memories gone forever I mean
13:16 sorry sorry memories there that's all
13:18 you got left but what you have is ashes
13:21 of this thing while it's still in flight
13:27 you have a chance to catch it to save it
13:32 to put it back in a safe place to
13:34 protect it build a bulletproof thing
13:37 around it you know create rules for who
13:41 can get near it because it is fragile
13:44 you can put lasers in the room and
13:47 motion detectors and all this crazy
13:48 stuff right well that's how we need to
13:51 protect freedom
13:54 because right now we have a Faberge egg
14:00 called freedom America has one that
14:03 looks one way every country in Europe if
14:08 there still are any countries in Europe
14:10 has their own and then England has its
14:13 own every one Canada Australia Museum
14:15 everyone has their own little egg
14:19 hopefully it's the way you like it
14:21 but now this cabal this Bill and Melinda
14:28 Gates Watchi Bill George Soros and all
14:33 their controllers which go all the way
14:35 up to the tippy tippy top of all things
14:40 they have come in and they've kicked the
14:43 table out from under this thing and
14:45 you're in bullet time watching it kind
14:48 of go up in the air and you're only
14:51 about three feet away from it so you
14:53 have a chance to do whatever dance you
14:56 got to do to squat to do the splits to
14:59 catch it you know even just use your
15:01 face as a cushion for it and yeah you'll
15:04 have a big egg shape bruise on your face
15:06 but in the end but things not gonna
15:08 break you'll do anything to save it but
15:14 what they're trying to do is destroy
15:16 freedom destroy it for ever but they
15:21 will this is what you have to understand
15:24 and repeat the people I mean I know you
15:26 get this but sometimes you don't slow
15:28 down the thought process enough to
15:30 analyze it so that you could make really
15:33 sharp gripping clawing words for the
15:36 mind so that someone else can see the
15:39 the peril that's going on here right now
15:43 with 9/11 we were caught completely
15:44 off-guard
15:46 we've never experienced anything like
15:49 that before
15:50 if you think about it you know Pearl
15:53 Harbor December 7th 1941 we got it
15:59 I thought the Thai and America State
16:03 free me eventually they did create these
16:06 concentration camps in America up in the
16:08 Bay Area the San Bruno concentration
16:10 camps for Japanese people not good but
16:14 we didn't fry them an oven we didn't do
16:18 anything to them they eventually did get
16:19 free but they were scarred and they were
16:21 pissed and it was a mistake and it
16:25 really didn't address the problem right
16:26 because there were Japanese people all
16:28 over the country but not all of them
16:29 were herded and the stupid camp sorry
16:32 but if Ansel we have to 911 they put
16:38 surcharges on our bills they I mean they
16:41 took advantage of this crisis on a level
16:43 that was ridiculous they legalized
16:45 spying on Americans CUNA's try to make
16:49 all that great telling you they've got
16:51 all the records of all the bad guys but
16:53 for some reason it doesn't work for one
16:56 [ __ ] arrest not one arrest it's nuts
17:02 now we have TSA scanners now it's just a
17:07 bunch of this bunch of that never was
17:10 the same but compared to today again
17:14 9/11 is just a blip means nothing
17:17 because of hype and our association with
17:22 the World Health Organization there is
17:25 no other place to blame but the World
17:29 Health Organization for this entire
17:31 [ __ ] mess one they cowered down to
17:35 China too they deemed it a pandemic
17:38 before it was one they had all of this
17:41 arranged so the CDC itself dumbed down
17:44 what it took to tell you that someone
17:47 died of kovat when they're not Diana
17:51 Coben if you suspected out of Kovac both
17:54 identically if you didn't do your work
17:57 then and figure out what was really
18:00 wrong with the patient and it's Kovac I
18:01 mean literally you find a bomb in an
18:02 alley it's Kofi again they said suicide
18:06 zhirkova you've said that
18:09 murders are kovat and you know quite
18:14 frankly there's an association if
18:16 someone got so panicked out that they
18:18 shot their spouse and an argument over
18:21 how to wear a mask or whether or not to
18:23 wear a mask when it's a co-ed related
18:25 death it is caused by this pandemic of
18:29 propaganda you know there's a virus out
18:34 there you know people die have probably
18:36 have been dying a corona virus every
18:38 single year that we have been on this
18:40 planet once that virus became active in
18:44 our genome okay but still without
18:51 sensationalizing the numbers we're not a
18:55 we're not at a historical pandemic
18:57 numbers yet hey maybe they get there
19:00 with a million people dead but let's
19:05 just rewind ok the 1918 flu don't want
19:12 to call it the Spanish flu that's what
19:13 it's known as but it didn't probably
19:15 originated in Spain they don't know
19:19 again when I reread all the critical
19:23 analysis of the Spanish flu they said it
19:26 was probably created in the trench
19:28 warfare because of World War one because
19:31 they said people had the whole symptom
19:34 table and died in Europe before single
19:37 case was reported in the Midwest of
19:39 Kansas in America or even in eastern
19:43 China doesn't really matter but the
19:47 lowest estimate of the Spanish flu the
19:51 1918 flush is called that the 17 million
19:54 people is the lowest estimate well
19:57 that's 17 times the definition the
20:00 historical requirement to call anything
20:03 a pandemic what was the highest estimate
20:06 a hundred million usually it's a high
20:11 estimate seventy two hundred the reason
20:14 why seventeen seems extremely low is
20:16 that India supposedly openly without
20:21 trying to hide in
20:22 Meishan claimed that they most likely
20:25 lost 20 million just all by themselves
20:30 okay let me ask you do we have and it
20:35 took two years to get rid of it so it
20:36 was 1918 and basically 1920 so let me
20:40 ask you did we have any good times
20:42 between 1920 and 2020 I think we did I
20:48 think we had some pretty good times
20:50 you know exercising zero social
20:53 distancing and how many other outbreaks
20:56 did we have that wasn't related to a
20:59 bsl-4 the chronal virus that has got a
21:03 patent in google where the bill Bill and
21:07 Melinda Gates Foundation was responsible
21:10 for funding part of it where United
21:13 States grant went through fashi
21:14 to support it where Harvard chemistry
21:17 dude
21:18 helped build it with foggy you know I
21:20 mean this is like so dirty it's not even
21:22 funny so this is a deliberate attack on
21:25 the world hey you can you know if you
21:31 want to blame a lot of these deaths that
21:33 we have on this then you should be more
21:35 furious than anything but you should
21:37 also be more convinced that there's no
21:40 need to take away the freedoms of us as
21:43 a result of a cabal of what probably
21:46 bounced about 50 people in the world
21:48 funding this thing and working on it and
21:51 releasing it either through incompetency
21:53 or intentionally how many of you have
21:56 seen the photos going around or the
21:59 video going around of the 2012 Olympic
22:01 ceremonies were in the ceremonies they
22:05 told you eight years ago that they were
22:08 gonna hatch a corona virus on the world
22:09 right there in the ceremonies I mean
22:12 you're looking at an Olympic ceremonies
22:13 in London I showed it to a friend of
22:16 mine who's a gigantic sports fan he has
22:18 every single statistic in his brain
22:20 memorized that could be memorized for
22:22 all decades all years all sports man
22:25 and I showed him the pictures and he
22:27 goes in Hyden remember this this is the
22:29 ceremonies either closing or the opening
22:30 ceremonies and he goes what the [ __ ] I
22:33 said yeah you watched it I wouldn't
22:36 that crap if you paid me I should pay me
22:39 a lot but it has a stage that's the
22:42 shape of a coronavirus it's all blue
22:44 it's like like cobalt blue amazing blue
22:47 right and then in a different scene
22:49 there's a gigantic 30 to 40 foot green
22:53 Reaper standing over a bunch of hospital
22:57 beds with dancers pretending to be
23:00 patients and then there's this like sick
23:02 dead baby head that's in the background
23:07 they showed you what they were going to
23:09 do at a minimum that would tell you that
23:14 this is over a ten-year old plan
23:17 remember how they tried to say that the
23:20 Simpsons didn't predict coronavirus
23:22 because in the mid-nineties like it's 96
23:24 or something they ran an episode where
23:26 they were totally dramatizing how they
23:28 were going to invent a virus get the
23:32 press in on it they even tested the
23:34 press guy with the shot and he died in
23:35 the room they were shipping the virus
23:38 inside boxes I mean they completely
23:40 predicted the whole thing back in 96
23:43 last 24 years ago people so they plan it
23:49 they show you in the 2012 Olympics they
23:52 show you in the 1996 Simpsons episode
23:55 and then you want to lose all your
23:59 freedoms all of a sudden that's the way
24:01 to fix the problem is for you to lose
24:03 your freedoms and fashi goes free
24:05 building them into the gates go free
24:06 George Soros goes free whatever
24:10 scientists from Harvard and China are go
24:13 free
24:14 they never incur any punishment
24:16 whatsoever and you lose your freedoms
24:21 7.5 billion people lose their freedoms
24:25 around the world so what are they doing
24:28 today this all develops into herd
24:31 mentality because today we're walking
24:34 around literally losing our freedoms so
24:38 some [ __ ] snowflakes don't get their
24:40 feelings hurt hey men not the [ __ ] up
24:44 screw those [ __ ] are seriously
24:47 because you're weak-minded these people
24:50 our weak-minded we lose our freedoms I
24:52 don't think so man the only reason why
24:55 weak people exist and haven't been
24:57 eliminated by the Darwin factor of
25:00 survival the fit is just because people
25:04 who stood up for freedom long before any
25:06 of us ever existed afforded us this
25:09 capability to be some entitled snowflake
25:13 we continually in this generation of
25:18 society last 20 years we keep rewarding
25:20 these snowflakes we keep rewarding these
25:23 liberal liberal folks I wouldn't even
25:26 say libertarians it's an insult to them
25:29 and of course they they understand that
25:32 they can take real situations like
25:35 there's a factor of the b2 movement that
25:38 was very real very very real needed to
25:41 be stopped the Weinsteins of the world
25:44 that bill cosby's of the world and a
25:46 million other folks right and then
25:48 there's a bunch of people that jump on
25:50 board and abuse the situation like the
25:52 woman who went after Kavanagh talk about
25:56 a farce man but everybody's worried
25:59 about a fitting everyone and then you
26:01 have the second tier of the herd
26:02 mentality which is everybody wants to be
26:03 on the winning team by is there more of
26:07 them then a so he'll I guess I'll switch
26:09 I guess I'll switch my my whole attitude
26:12 towards the role cuz I want to be on
26:13 that winning team I'm part of that
26:16 survival of the fittest to be a coward
26:17 and go against your very principles
26:21 these people that are protesting to get
26:24 the country turned back on all the
26:26 countries turned back on all the states
26:28 and cities turned back up you know it's
26:32 like I'm just so proud of them but we
26:38 all know what's going on now they said
26:41 that there's some misquoting going on by
26:43 the press but everyone's talking about
26:46 the second wave is if it's some [ __ ]
26:47 imperative it's not an imperative why is
26:50 the second way of happening in northern
26:52 China right now because they never
26:53 cleaned it all up because the CCP is a
26:58 very propagandist century
27:02 mechanism the only thing the CCP does is
27:06 take credit for everything that happens
27:07 it's good and then when it's bad they
27:10 blame everybody else and the first first
27:14 folks they blame are their own citizens
27:17 if that doesn't work I think he's blamed
27:20 somebody else a different country but
27:24 now everybody's pushing back right but
27:27 they have had you know people like
27:29 Trudeau I mean what a piece of work that
27:33 guy is he's a dude that's never had any
27:36 power in his life and so he does what
27:39 he's like he's like a he's Castro's son
27:42 he's a total sociopath right and so he
27:48 is loving it he is finally able to go to
27:51 the mic and be important and what does
27:53 he want to do to Canadians take away all
27:56 your freedoms men it's already pretty
27:58 bad up there anyway but they want to
28:00 take away all your he's just loving he's
28:02 loving it and there's only a few leaders
28:05 in the planet that are fighting back and
28:07 saying I don't think so but they have so
28:10 infiltrated Europe it is unbelievable
28:14 now they're trying to twist in turn you
28:18 know Britain into it the self-loathing
28:20 thing because they finally brexit it out
28:22 of the EU Oh believe me they're trying
28:26 to punish I mean the punishment for the
28:28 UK getting out of the EU has only begun
28:32 has only begun
28:35 so Trump just keeps closing the borders
28:38 keeps just making it technically
28:40 impossible for us to have second waves
28:44 they're gonna find some stupid excuse it
28:47 won't take much rain ain't ate it mhmmm
28:50 the common cold became a common cold
28:52 again oh my god crazy now the tough
28:56 thing is this because my but he called
28:59 me from up north he's in just above LA
29:02 and he said he got kicked out of a store
29:08 camera which one it was because he
29:10 wouldn't wear a mask and he's not a guy
29:12 to get a big sympathetic bone from rage
29:14 so he so
29:16 what'd you say cuz I know he said
29:17 something he goes um he goes I I asked
29:23 him I said you don't believe in this
29:24 [ __ ] do you and then he walked out and
29:26 so he is in a very liberal Hollywood
29:30 area so he's in trouble he keeps asking
29:32 me what it's like down here so dude just
29:34 come on down then it's you'll be in
29:36 America again in Orange County you get
29:41 what is it some dude stood it on a beach
29:45 I think it was Florida or something but
29:47 he's in full naval officer gear all his
29:50 medals since I mean officer gear it's
29:52 what you wear to a ball you know it's
29:55 what you were to a big fancy gathering
29:57 and he stood knee-deep in waves with his
30:03 hands behind his back that full of
30:07 tension while this I don't know
30:10 rent-a-cop stood there waiting for him
30:12 to come out and he just stood there and
30:14 the funny thing is is that between two
30:16 men just in case you ladies don't pick
30:18 up on this they were in a cop knows he's
30:22 outclassed fifty to one when you see a
30:25 little plate and I think the guy was
30:27 real hopefully it's not stolen valor you
30:29 could have arrested in her stolen banner
30:30 if it was we looked fully legit he has a
30:32 whole plate of all of his medals and
30:35 it's like you're just you just I mean no
30:37 offense dude but you're just a [ __ ]
30:38 beach cop dude you don't have to be real
30:42 police officer you just you just get
30:44 badged up and you own the beach for a
30:46 while and we need those people for real
30:47 reasons but these guys you know it's
30:49 easy to duplicate that smart all police
30:55 officers get smart typically eventually
30:58 typically some places don't but a lot of
31:01 them do maybe they interrupt the
31:03 interest kids that will do anything and
31:05 then they start to see enough stuff now
31:07 they also get cynical unfortunately
31:08 because they get they have to they have
31:11 to see the worst of society every single
31:13 day unfortunately freedom is not
31:16 something that you look over your
31:18 shoulder to see if anyone else gives a
31:21 [ __ ] about it freedom is something that
31:24 you maintain or you die it's just as
31:28 simple
31:29 I know death it seems like a really
31:31 horrendous thing I just don't think
31:34 there's any need for any violence I
31:35 haven't seen these protests I've seen
31:37 the protests have a significant impact
31:39 on senators mayor's governors it's
31:42 working
31:43 not a single bullets been fired at all
31:46 not even close as far as I know there
31:50 was a shooting up in Canada because
31:52 Trudeau's like a man I know that you
31:55 can't do false flags down in America
31:57 right now because Trump's got the place
31:58 locked down but hey you know use Canada
32:01 use Canada because I want to get rid of
32:02 guns in Canada even further than they
32:04 already are
32:05 yeah honestly I don't know of a lot of
32:09 violence that happens in Canada anyway
32:11 seem to be pretty chill people we get
32:13 most of our top comedians from Canada
32:15 something's going up that gone up there
32:17 and something makes them have a great
32:19 sense of humor if you can pull it off we
32:23 have no guns and nobody's hurting
32:24 anybody
32:25 yeah go ahead and do it don't be
32:28 surprised if the Horde comes over the
32:30 mountain one day and takes away your
32:32 country it won't be us it'll be somebody
32:34 I mean my god just think about this in
32:41 history there have been villages with
32:44 basically no weapons no armor besides a
32:47 backhoe and maybe a sword or something
32:49 or spear or something here and there and
32:52 you know the Mongols they just walked
32:54 over Eurasia
32:56 and most you know a touch Europe and
32:59 just because nobody was sitting around
33:01 with an army and they just were like
33:02 walking in just beaten up drunk people
33:04 basically it's a sad thing that it
33:07 happens but it does happen so
33:09 unfortunately you wanna have a good
33:13 strong moral base and then tons of guns
33:15 and the morals that you worship keep
33:19 your guns at bay and you know I know
33:22 that I beat up in some form or another
33:27 Christianity you know from several
33:30 different angles but I was talking to a
33:32 friend of mine today
33:34 and the something about religion came up
33:37 in the midst of all this thing and I
33:38 just told her I said look I said if
33:45 there was any point in time that the
33:47 Christian base in America is absolutely
33:54 necessary and will fix this whole
33:57 situation as long as the preachers don't
34:00 get paid off and boy do they get paid
34:04 off but a good Christian base believes
34:09 in the ten commandments and so if you
34:13 got a good Christian base who believes
34:15 in the ten commandments and the
34:16 Constitution of the United States is the
34:18 first ten Bill of Rights you get up and
34:20 they're armed to the teeth right then
34:24 you're pretty safe because one they
34:27 don't believe in shooting you just
34:29 because you had an argument they won't
34:31 touch your wife's they're your husband's
34:34 they'll take care of your kids
34:35 they're good strong Christians they're
34:38 going to be the backbone of a decent
34:40 society which is one reason why you know
34:43 I'm always saying to my friends and I
34:45 say to you guys there once in a while
34:47 you have to have a moral code otherwise
34:50 you were just a particle in the universe
34:53 that shouldn't exist because you'll be
34:57 evil and you'll just do anything you'll
34:59 sell everybody out for everything
35:01 constantly good Christian base is what I
35:04 have I don't have to believe that the
35:07 Savior really really existed because
35:10 that I follow mythical characters that
35:14 have qualities that I like all the time
35:16 we differ all the time we watch a movie
35:17 right you vicariously appreciate the
35:21 hero you know the hero is not real but
35:25 you're like man I want to be I want to
35:26 be Spock man now of course you do gain
35:31 other things if you're pro-choice then
35:33 you don't get that so much so it's one
35:36 of those things it's kind of like you
35:39 got to pick your battles you have to
35:41 pick sort of the yin and the yang I mean
35:43 imagine if somebody said to even a
35:47 pro-choice
35:48 person you can hide your how pro-choice
35:51 and tyranny in fact will decide whether
35:55 that you have any pro-life in your in
35:56 your entire gene pool right you can get
35:58 pregnant let's take your kid away from
36:00 you like China used to do supposedly I
36:02 mean they're their population got really
36:05 big with this supposed population
36:08 control make in this movie again most my
36:09 friends said it was all a lie the CCP
36:13 lying you go figure but they say to you
36:17 you can have pro-life and tyranny or I
36:19 mean sorry pro-choice and tyranny or
36:22 pro-life and freedom that's your choice
36:25 meaning you can you can pick your job
36:31 pick your education pick where you live
36:32 you decide whether or not you're gonna
36:34 buy a big house small house big car a
36:36 little car have this 90 inch television
36:40 sit at home watch you know TV all day
36:43 long you have that choice that's your
36:44 freedom option but you have to take the
36:49 ball base of the people that will fight
36:51 to the death so that you can have that
36:53 privilege or Planned Parenthood becomes
36:59 the overwhelming eugenics group that
37:06 helps you never get pregnant takes your
37:09 kids away from you and sells their body
37:11 parts off to the elite of the world so
37:13 they can stay a little bit thinner a
37:14 little bit keep their hair color and
37:16 skin texture so there's pros and there's
37:21 cons have herd mentality if you heard
37:22 for freedom I'm gonna say that's a
37:25 decent thing to witness if you want to
37:29 heard for tyranny well I think you've
37:33 just elected yourself off the planet
37:36 that gene that weak minded gene which is
37:40 induced now I think by vaccinations
37:43 right it just makes you weak and so they
37:47 can do it too you don't eat meat it'll
37:53 do it to you it'd be nice if the world
37:57 didn't have these people in there but we
38:00 know now in 2020
38:01 that not only do these people exist but
38:04 they are everywhere we now know how many
38:09 Mockingbird press people exist at least
38:13 in the light yeah it used to be to catch
38:16 a roach you'd have to turn it lights off
38:17 and they'd crawl out on the floor and
38:20 the eternal lights on they fly away you
38:21 know you run away daddy's no big deal
38:23 man they're all over the walls in the
38:25 middle of the day they're in the white
38:27 house asking ridiculous stupid questions
38:30 I think I said it before but here we are
38:34 in the middle of you know if you believe
38:37 the [ __ ] right we've got all these
38:39 [ __ ] people dying everybody's sick
38:41 we're trying to focus we're trying to
38:43 distribute information to make people
38:45 well to give people tools to detect
38:49 symptoms and get themselves taken care
38:51 of let's just say you believe everything
38:53 and it means some people definitely
38:56 diner this stuff but and you get people
39:00 sitting in there asking the president
39:01 you know blame game questions and just
39:04 stupid made-up sensationalism
39:06 sensationalistic crap was it 17,000
39:11 people died and 65 million people were
39:15 infected before Obama responded to h1n1
39:19 before he responded at all we had what
39:23 not a single death before Trump locked
39:27 up the borders and he's a bad guy which
39:30 side are you on man it's a good time to
39:32 pick which side you're on anyone trying
39:36 to take away your freedoms and saying
39:37 this line of horseshit we're never going
39:40 back to normal I don't know if you can
39:42 kick them in the balls and get away with
39:44 it without getting charged you know do
39:46 it with verbs and nouns and adjectives
39:50 to make sure that they realize it's like
39:53 that's in your [ __ ] fantasy in your
39:55 brain you weak-minded [ __ ] or
39:57 you shill because we're not going down
40:01 that way you know we're not gonna let
40:03 you take away another huge bash because
40:05 again if you thought 9/11 was bad I
40:07 don't even know what the exponential
40:09 number is is it times 10 is the times
40:12 100 is the times a million
40:14 of what they're gonna try to do Anderson
40:18 Cooper was interviewing the mayor of Las
40:21 Vegas this woman I don't know her name
40:23 let me pay attention but of course he's
40:26 trying to bait her into a green through
40:29 peer pressure because that's all
40:30 Anderson understands they're trying to
40:34 bait her into agreeing to opening up
40:36 restaurants her went six feet away from
40:38 each other and she just laughed at him
40:41 she said you know that's your diagram
40:44 but this is Las Vegas Nevada if you know
40:46 anything about Las Vegas it is one of
40:49 the roughest toughest cities that
40:51 succeeded in becoming a city for those
40:55 of you who don't know American history
40:56 Dodge City Kansas which is out east or
41:00 sorry out west of Kansas was one of the
41:02 blood baths of the 1800s I mean the
41:07 amount of people that get killed there
41:08 it was just a rough tough joint it was
41:10 sort of a proxy point between the Salina
41:16 Kansas McCoy cattle which is really sort
41:20 of branding cattle it's where you get
41:21 the real McCoy from and Oklahoma and
41:25 Texas eventually caught up with that and
41:28 overtook them with more cattle but they
41:30 would take all the cattle to Colorado
41:31 just where the prices were really high
41:34 to sell the cattle to be eaten right
41:37 well Dodge City it was this place they
41:39 would stop when they're on that track
41:41 towards Colorado Tombstone Arizona
41:46 that's the OK Corral it's pretty pretty
41:49 credible stuff happen there there's a
41:51 few cities there's Deadwood South Dakota
41:53 rough tough joint none of those places
41:56 are big cities but Las Vegas was just
42:01 rough and tough man and it's a huge city
42:04 and it made it so this ladies laughing
42:07 in his face and he goes my call it's
42:09 like so ignorant of you oh really mr.
42:12 mockingbird Press guy Anderson Cooper is
42:15 a Vanderbilt his mother's a saint inist
42:18 his brother she's a part of a saint as
42:21 cults that believe that you should have
42:23 two kids and sacrifice one and right
42:26 after his 21st birthday
42:28 Anderson Cooper's brother mysteriously
42:30 dies there's a picture of him his
42:35 brother and his mother sitting on a beds
42:37 this beautiful shot
42:38 but above her is the black madonna with
42:41 this jesus's head cut off I mean like
42:45 total Satanists right and the previous
42:48 Pope before this current one they shared
42:51 an amulet that they used to wear of
42:52 course that's the guy used to have the
42:53 devil on his lapel - any worse they all
42:57 wear the red shoes which is symbolistic
42:59 of human flesh right just like Tony
43:02 Podesta so let's let's create the two
43:07 herds that are active right now and
43:10 let's make sure that our friends
43:11 understand what they're getting involved
43:13 in especially the super weak-minded ones
43:15 that don't think things through because
43:17 they keep their head in the sand the
43:18 entire time right yeah global warming as
43:21 a part of that group as well which is
43:23 part of agenda 21 tyranny right this
43:26 whole thing is agenda 21 the whole thing
43:30 excuse for depopulation so that the
43:32 world doesn't rebelle while it's being
43:35 killed off on the globalist side heard
43:40 which is where climate changes and all
43:43 this other [ __ ] that's where the
43:45 pandemic originates from they fund it
43:47 they patent it the patent in Google
43:50 which I believe the you will never ever
43:55 be in power in that hurt because there's
43:59 a pyramid in that herd over there
44:01 they're at the tippy top and you're down
44:04 below and they eat your kids so they can
44:08 stay young they promote what you think
44:11 is pro-choice but it's their business
44:14 plan to get your kids so they can
44:17 literally and ingest their body parts
44:21 okay their blood
44:22 it's crazy but it's true on the other
44:26 herd we have your moral code perhaps a
44:33 lot of Christians in this one too okay
44:35 over here we don't have a pyramid we
44:39 have a flat org chart all humans are
44:43 made equal all humans have a Neeley
44:46 noble rights as protected by a
44:48 government type called a republic and
44:50 that is what America was founded on
44:53 that's why Trump always says it's a
44:55 republic republic isn't up for debate
44:58 your constitutional rights are not up
45:00 for debate
45:01 these cops are running around arresting
45:03 people and giving people tickets for
45:05 being outside or all in violation of the
45:08 constitutional rights of those citizens
45:09 and every single one of them can be sued
45:12 both through their precinct but they can
45:15 be sued on a civil court level now they
45:19 may try to pass some legislation to get
45:21 all these cops out of losing their
45:23 pensions and in liquefying all their
45:25 assets to fight in court but as long as
45:29 people can talk about the damages
45:31 psychological damage job damage every
45:35 senator every single person that said
45:38 you can't open your business is liable
45:39 for that business's damages now again so
45:42 in your country is really tough so when
45:44 your state's really tough
45:47 there's 22 million people unemployed all
45:49 the sudden I think before that it was
45:53 like something like three or four
45:54 million something like that maybe even
45:57 less so let's see what your choices
46:02 you're a serf you are told what to do
46:06 for the rest of your life if they say
46:08 you got to shave your head and wear a
46:09 white sheet that's what you got to do if
46:12 they say drones are gonna fly around and
46:14 you have put cameras in your house and
46:17 you're gonna have to have one of these
46:18 like you know Google Alexa things
46:21 because they want to listen to every
46:22 single room that's the law that's what
46:25 you're gonna have to do and as soon as
46:26 you open it up you're gonna have forced
46:28 existence tax you have to have health
46:31 care existence tax anything that you
46:34 make they'll take it away from you it's
46:35 the old plantation algorithm from a long
46:37 time ago and you will not survive you
46:41 will commit suicide you will kill your
46:43 spouse you may never have any kids I
46:45 mean that world is a quick death
46:48 it's a quick certain death in that
46:51 pyramid over there because they don't
46:52 want you there anyway they want just to
46:54 be a para meridean stone on top of the
46:56 pyramid and that's it they want enough
46:59 people around which probably gonna be
47:01 white people because they know that
47:04 we've been we've been privileged with
47:07 the experience of true freedom they're
47:08 gonna want people maybe from China who
47:10 have been under the CCP maybe people
47:12 from North Korea who have liked this
47:14 dictatorship they like those people
47:16 because they will do whatever they're
47:18 told to do because they haven't tasted
47:20 the freedom just yet which is why we
47:23 want to spread it everywhere so soon as
47:24 you taste it oh my god it's like the
47:26 most addictive drug in the world so they
47:30 will find people that have been
47:32 oppressed suppressed oppressed and they
47:34 will make those the worker bees to take
47:37 care of the lawn and the food creation
47:41 and anything but what what sort of
47:46 lifestyle did sleeves have when they
47:49 came to America this happened many times
47:51 before America but where slaves treated
47:53 really really well in America hmm maybe
47:57 you should ask around if you think the
47:59 answer
47:59 yes no they weren't allowed to study
48:03 religion they weren't allowed to educate
48:04 themselves according to Tarantino the
48:07 the men were actually brought into one
48:09 guide to beat the other guy to death not
48:11 one just for entertainment the women
48:15 were raped by their owners okay
48:20 so do you think that being in this pair
48:23 emeriti in pyramid scheme heard there's
48:27 going to be less than that or more than
48:30 that in terms of benefits they'll treat
48:34 you well to the degree there are enough
48:38 of you to rise up to kill them the
48:40 second that they've got technology to
48:42 keep you in check oh brother
48:44 an ankle bracelet will be the kindest
48:49 thing your body will have on it to track
48:52 everything that you do over in this
48:56 other camp the freedom camp the Republic
48:59 the inalienable rights god-fearing God
49:01 believing people cannot to believe in
49:04 Christianity at all but you can still
49:07 believe in a God believe is
49:08 repercussions but there's a lot of
49:09 atheists would be in this group and no
49:12 no time flat you could be in your house
49:17 anywhere in the world creating your own
49:20 destiny your own that you could go work
49:23 for someone else you could work for
49:25 yourself you could retire at 25 years
49:28 old if you wanted to one because if this
49:31 side over here the freedom side the
49:34 inalienable right side succeeds well
49:37 there won't be any more boom and busts
49:38 that won't be any more crappy economies
49:40 based on a sell of a barrel of oil
49:42 they'll have money that's worth
49:44 something if money at all and you'll be
49:48 closer to Gene Roddenberry's world in
49:51 Star Trek than you've ever been in your
49:52 life education will go through the roof
49:56 which means population will go down and
49:58 stabilize because everyone will want to
50:02 taste a little bit of destiny and
50:03 children are part of your destiny in a
50:06 lot of cases especially if there's good
50:08 systems to take care of them single
50:10 income household would take would come
50:13 back if that group succeeded over here
50:16 it's gonna be like oh my god yeah four
50:18 generation stuck in one house I watched
50:22 a really disturbing video yesterday
50:28 which was a you know I think a lot of
50:32 you know that in Hong Kong especially
50:33 there are landlords that rent apartments
50:39 with cages in them they're like big dog
50:43 cages and there's people living in
50:49 there's a usually single males they live
50:51 in these cages
50:52 I've seen many documentaries on these
50:54 but I've never seen anyone actually
50:55 talked to the people and you know to be
50:59 honest what was it done it was one of
51:03 the Transformers movies Michael Bay had
51:05 the robots climbing on some buildings I
51:08 think in Hong Kong and he revealed them
51:11 for one second and one shot you saw the
51:14 people living in cages but they
51:17 interviewed these guys which you know
51:19 you can't really tell how old anyone is
51:21 especially when they're malnutritioned
51:23 these guys were skinny as being pulse
51:25 like full I think five eight to six foot
51:28 kind of guys but they were probably
51:31 between upper 50s to maybe mid 60s and
51:36 they interviewed him and asked him why
51:38 do you live in these cages what happened
51:41 it's almost like one step up from
51:43 homelessness you know and they were like
51:46 one you know they walked into a room in
51:48 the news were like hey don't film us in
51:49 here don't film us in here and the whole
51:51 thing was the one they didn't want to
51:52 get in trouble with the landlord but -
51:54 it was considered extremely embarrassing
51:56 that they actually lived like that they
51:57 weren't even in their cages at the time
51:59 they were sitting in the middle of the
52:00 room that looked completely normal just
52:01 like they had cages maybe like they had
52:03 animals but there's no animals they
52:06 interviewed two different guys and this
52:10 is just an to illustrate the point of
52:13 like dictatorships and the way that one
52:16 lives and most of you probably heard the
52:19 rumors of North Korea which is like I
52:21 completely bizarre upgrade from CCP
52:26 terms of tyranny both guys it was kind
52:35 of like a gentle conversation up to a
52:37 point and then they asked him you know
52:40 hey why well did you ever get married or
52:44 did you want to have kids and I've heard
52:48 this a lot I've heard this a lot with
52:49 the survivors of the virus over there
52:51 because the situation is fresh for them
52:54 but both guys had the same excuse and he
52:58 said that their parents their mothers
53:00 had died it was sort of an endearing
53:04 heartbreaking thing that in that culture
53:07 the families work together to help raise
53:09 and you know everyone does this to the
53:11 extent you can but like in America if
53:14 your if your mother were to pass you
53:17 still have children you still do you
53:19 just don't have anyone to babysit right
53:22 and you should want to be with your kids
53:24 I mean I love doing with my kid and she
53:26 was young but these men who grew up over
53:33 there with that has very strict culture
53:35 that you have to have family units above
53:37 you in order to have a kid as soon as
53:40 their mothers died they gave up on ever
53:42 getting married because if you get
53:43 married you have kids and if you have
53:45 kids you got to have parents that help
53:46 you take care of the kids but the sad
53:48 thing was is that the second they
53:50 mentioned that their mothers had passed
53:52 both of them started to weep these are
53:55 separate interviews I mean they really
53:57 just choked up and they kept talking and
54:01 it was just so passionate you know their
54:04 love for their family was as high as it
54:08 gets
54:09 and that's the other pyramid that's the
54:13 other group of people that have
54:16 unfortunately been born into a
54:17 dictatorship born into a communistic
54:21 regime where there isn't a sort of well
54:29 one of the big critiques I heard
54:31 recently was that the reason why the
54:34 kids in China are largely not inventors
54:39 but copy
54:39 and they're damn good at it up to a
54:42 point was that when you grow up in a
54:45 communist ik regime you don't allow free
54:48 thoughts and when you don't have free
54:50 thoughts you don't have creativity which
54:52 is why America and Europe are these and
54:57 you know I mean everyone involved with
54:59 that group just you know that's why a
55:01 massive creativity comes out of these
55:03 groups and why in China you don't have
55:07 that I mean it's an assertion I've heard
55:11 several times it's definitely been my
55:12 personal experience you know I work for
55:15 an all [ __ ] company for about a year
55:17 and a month and it was a very very
55:22 different culture and there was this
55:25 like there's this thing with sort of the
55:30 saving face thing which is pride you
55:34 know most European first world American
55:36 countries we call it pride and but
55:41 Americans will break the pride barrier
55:43 to get help you know you're gonna die
55:45 like if you messed up your life for
55:47 instance it's completely messed it up
55:49 you're sick you got a bullet wound fresh
55:52 or whatever it is most first world folks
55:56 that I have dealt with will eventually
55:57 go hey man help me help me I'm dying you
56:00 know it'll be like you crossed that
56:01 barrier and it's a metaphor for other
56:05 things that happen to you but this CCCP
56:11 saving face and we don't have anything
56:13 wrong with us we're completely perfect
56:14 just like kim jong un's family the only
56:16 the kim family
56:17 excuse me they're not allowed to say
56:20 anything bad about the leaders but the
56:22 leaders have problems the middle
56:24 generation goes to kim jong ill well
56:30 there was a problem with russia falling
56:33 it was a surprise to them they had a
56:35 famine that potentially killed 20
56:37 million of their peoples not more and so
56:40 they just suffer if you don't think it
56:46 can happen here just look around man did
56:48 you ever think that
56:49 country wherever you live if it's free
56:52 did you ever think your country would be
56:54 told to shut down if you own a business
56:57 that can't function right now everything
56:59 that would ever happen from like an
57:01 order from on high
57:02 we don't have the statistics to support
57:05 true pandemic I mean maybe we another
57:11 thing is I don't even buy these numbers
57:13 you know like that you might be led to
57:15 say and I almost said it which is um
57:16 well because we quarantine like San
57:19 Francisco did during the 1918 flu
57:20 perhaps we just avoided you know a true
57:26 pandemic maybe there's some truth to
57:27 that I don't personally have any
57:30 first-degree friends that have ever had
57:32 it and my first-degree friends don't
57:36 know anyone who's had it either you know
57:41 it's it's they're just playing with our
57:43 heads men but this idea okay that you
57:50 know take take any other form of death
57:52 and apply it to the lunacy that's going
57:56 on because this is just a global [ __ ]
57:58 scam it's just a global scam so they can
58:00 install this tyranny which is were herd
58:04 mentality he's gonna facilitate that
58:05 it's gonna hurt men tell he's either
58:07 gonna save the world or it's gonna kill
58:08 the world off you know again I I feel
58:13 like you know Jesus I've been talking
58:16 about this Georgia Guidestones now for
58:19 five years and my show before that we
58:22 talked about it for a hundred and twenty
58:24 episodes you know off and on and you
58:27 know it was always like I wonder how
58:29 they're gonna pull that off I just could
58:30 never figure it out it's like all of a
58:32 sudden I'm sitting right in the middle
58:33 of them going oh so they're gonna pull
58:35 it off right
58:36 insanity men in sanity but I have to say
58:43 I mean it's one of these things where
58:47 like you'll see a good boxing match for
58:51 instance with two master boxers and it's
58:55 not Don King creating some fake fight
58:57 you know where it's like some poor drunk
59:00 from some bar fighting my tyson you know
59:03 39 seconds although I have to give it up
59:07 to that that Irish dude who did fight
59:09 him for 39 seconds so I mean getting
59:12 into getting in the ring with Mike Tyson
59:13 is sort of a life and death situation
59:16 for you the balls I have to give the guy
59:19 and a word just for having the guts to
59:21 go in there but when you have two great
59:25 boxers going in there like a George
59:27 Foreman against Muhammad Ali kind of
59:29 thing and they just battle royale for
59:32 whatever it is 12 rounds and at the end
59:37 of the fight it goes to a decision card
59:39 because neither one of them could knock
59:41 each other out right they've knocked
59:43 each other down several times but never
59:45 knocked him full ko right TKO okay and
59:49 then they go up to each other after the
59:51 fight and give each other a hug happens
59:54 all the time there's a point when you do
60:00 respect and I think you you gain
60:03 something from respecting the power of
60:06 your enemy when you respect the
60:08 intelligence of your enemy I just
60:10 finished editing and uploading the
60:14 psychopathic leaders episode which has
60:16 an aired yet and I told you in there
60:20 it's like you always have to Revere the
60:21 intelligence of your enemy because that
60:24 allows you to think like your enemy into
60:26 to anticipate your enemies every move
60:32 it's probably some sense a thing I think
60:37 at one point I owned the art of war but
60:38 I I think I don't know I usually read
60:42 all my books a couple times and I don't
60:44 remember ever getting through that book
60:45 completely I just picked up someone
60:47 else's copy but think about how utterly
60:51 coordinated and ingenious this scam is
60:53 and we're just always sitting there
60:55 going can't we all just get along which
60:58 is why those of us that are totally
61:00 frustrated with this LARP called the cue
61:03 and on movement you know the people are
61:05 real the education that they have
61:08 received in thanking original thoughts
61:09 is very real but the actions just aren't
61:13 happening now again we're all waiting
61:16 row
61:16 the boy they they got the sneak attack
61:21 pretty of you played video games sir
61:23 it's like a a war game you know that if
61:26 you can ever get the buff the feature
61:30 whereby you get a sneak attack you get a
61:32 surprise attack you get the first attack
61:34 and Dungeons and Dragons you see it all
61:36 the time you know that there's a
61:39 distinct advantage you usually get like
61:42 a kill shot on something like you you
61:45 know just for technicalities purposes of
61:48 describing this let's say they had a big
61:50 Hulk character and on their side but you
61:54 get a sneak attack
61:55 so sneak attacks you can take forever to
61:58 do your attack cuz you're gonna get it
61:59 and you look at all the weak spots you
62:01 find the deathblow for the Hulk and then
62:04 boom you punch him in his kidney he
62:05 falls down dead and they lost their
62:07 biggest weapon and before you before
62:09 they know it you're on top of them
62:11 that's what just happened to us we were
62:15 carrying this crystal egg perhaps a
62:19 Faberge egg it's very delicate it's
62:23 taken us thousands and thousands of
62:25 years to coordinate the construction of
62:29 this thing and they just walked up
62:31 behind you behind you
62:33 sneak attack and punched your elbow and
62:36 now this thing is going poof it's flying
62:38 in the air and we're looking at freedom
62:41 in the air as this delicate thing and
62:45 we've got to do whatever we can to one
62:48 put a kick back on them kick them in the
62:50 balls whatever you got to do
62:51 incapacitate them at least for a second
62:53 while you spend the rest of your time
62:55 catching this this freedom that we might
62:58 be losing and then you got to get that
63:02 thing to a safe place because you're
63:03 still in the middle of a battle all
63:05 right you gotta catch it if you can put
63:08 it down in a safe place and you're gonna
63:10 have to strategically fight your war
63:12 almost like a pool table with all the
63:14 balls right you always have to put the
63:15 cue ball where you want your next shot
63:17 to be right so for the rest of this
63:19 fight in that living room you got to
63:21 heat the enemy away from the egg because
63:23 all they want to do is take a hammer and
63:25 smash it and then they're done there
63:27 well you can kill me now I've killed
63:29 your freedom it's over
63:29 I win and so every blow that you make
63:34 everything that you do against that
63:35 enemy is going to have to strategically
63:37 keep them away from the egg you want to
63:39 fight them back to the door and
63:41 hopefully you can put it you know dagger
63:43 in their throat or wherever you got to
63:45 do to get rid of them but here's the
63:47 thing all of you know this stuff but I
63:52 think it's really important to review
63:55 the reason why the arrests are so
63:58 absolutely vital and I mean there's some
64:04 inconceivable arrests that have to occur
64:07 and I mean truly inconceivable arrests
64:09 that have to occur because if you leave
64:13 a little bit of that stuff behind it
64:17 grows how many of you remember Stephen
64:20 King's movie creep show especially the
64:25 meteor skit where Stephen King himself
64:27 was inside the episode and he went out
64:31 back after meteor landed in his backyard
64:33 and it's one of the funniest things he's
64:36 ever done he's gonna turn into a
64:37 complete douche these days unfortunately
64:39 he must be involved with the stuff but
64:44 he touches it and it burns his hand all
64:45 I got cool sumbitch off and then he he
64:49 gets that green stuff on him that's
64:50 inside and he that's God I got meteor
64:53 [ __ ] on me or something like that and
64:55 then he bites his fingers they cool I'll
64:57 cool it off which means he put the green
64:59 virus in his mouth those of you haven't
65:02 seen it it's a little tiny acorn sized
65:07 meteorite that broke in half because it
65:09 was so hot had green goo in it he
65:11 touches it burns his fingers put some in
65:13 his mouth to cool off his fingers and
65:14 then it starts to grow all over his body
65:17 it starts to grow all over the
65:19 countryside
65:20 he eventually blows his head off
65:23 although it's not gory because he's a
65:25 complete bush sitting down in his
65:29 kitchen that's completely covered in his
65:31 green fur and he basically pops the top
65:35 it looks like you just clipped the top
65:37 of the bush off and he dies and then
65:39 they pulled the camera out and you see
65:41 the whole neighborhood
65:43 countryside looks like Kansas all
65:45 covered with this green fern it's gonna
65:47 take over the whole world just this
65:48 little tiny acorn it's gonna destroy the
65:52 world
65:52 well that meteorite is any one of these
65:58 people that are supposedly indicted
66:01 supposedly I'm gonna get arrested and so
66:06 to combine the two analogies for the
66:10 purpose of this discussion the
66:14 meteorites already landed thousands of
66:16 years ago the Fuhrer has already grown
66:19 out of the thing several times we have
66:22 burned it back to its core but no one
66:25 has had the guts or maybe perhaps the
66:29 capability of getting rid of the acorn
66:31 itself and so it just keeps going back
66:33 and keeps going back and we keep
66:35 fighting it down so right now it looks
66:39 like someone from China got a bunch of
66:40 this [ __ ] and just put it on all their
66:42 people and then they went all over the
66:43 world and spread it but that may not
66:46 even be true you know because this
66:51 faccia guy was involved with this other
66:52 stuff right you know it was all
66:54 instigated here in the States or it was
66:56 maybe instigated here and then taken to
66:58 Wu Hans bsl-4 and then you know this was
67:02 planned man this was not a mishap this
67:05 was not an accidental wet market thing I
67:08 don't you think what markets had
67:10 anything to do with it I don't
67:11 personally that's where I'm at today and
67:13 so we've got to burn it down to the core
67:18 and you know what's funny is one of my
67:20 most liberal buddies in Hollywood is a
67:22 very accomplished dude he once told me
67:25 at lunch he said you know because he was
67:29 hearing me talk about these folks and he
67:31 he has a he knows that they're there he
67:34 knows that they're bad but he's just
67:36 sort of joined them in the sense that he
67:39 doesn't try to waste any time in his
67:41 life fighting them and I get it he's
67:44 been doing pretty amazing projects for
67:46 his life but I forgot how exactly he
67:50 said he said it so eloquently it's it
67:52 was great but he said to me over lunch
67:54 like 10 years ago he said um said you
68:00 know if I could you know sure I'd put
68:01 all these people on a spaceship and I'd
68:03 send it to the Sun just remove their DNA
68:07 from the entire genome of humanity but
68:11 he said you know I can't fight that war
68:14 too old it was funny was I met him
68:19 thirteen years ago our first meeting was
68:21 like nine hours long and literally the
68:24 first time I ever really truly sat down
68:26 with him because they had a mutual
68:28 friend of his that said we should get
68:30 together and he goes you should create a
68:32 show on the internet with all this stuff
68:36 but what did he have he was I guess
68:39 eight years ahead of the curve but he
68:41 was right and here we are but he and I
68:45 disagree about tons of [ __ ] right you
68:49 know history's just had so much of this
68:52 so much of this if you don't get rid of
68:55 the systemic problem it grows back it's
68:59 just its nature you know it said I'm
69:02 gonna tell this old story so if you've
69:03 heard this story a million times there's
69:05 a couple different versions of the story
69:06 so but it's the Scorpion and the Fox and
69:14 there's this raging river and they both
69:17 need to cross the river for some reason
69:19 the foods on the other side is generally
69:20 how it's told it's supposed to be a
69:21 Native American story
69:23 it was it Tuvok no no sorry Chakotay
69:27 excuse me Chakotay was telling Janeway
69:30 in Star Trek Voyager this story which is
69:32 where I heard it the first time and he
69:35 tells the story he says the Scorpion
69:38 goes up to the Fox and says you know are
69:42 you gonna cross the river and he says
69:43 yeah and he goes what can I write on
69:45 your back he says no this is why he goes
69:49 because she'll sting me and you'll kill
69:51 me and I don't need that right now
69:54 right it needs that I won't stain you he
69:55 goes if I sting you then you'll drowned
69:59 and I'm on your back and then I'll drown
70:01 with you so I'm not gonna sting you and
70:04 he's like oh Jesus man this sounds like
70:07 a really bad idea
70:08 and so he thought he was okay promise
70:12 right yep
70:13 sure so the Scorpion gets on the fox's
70:16 back and he started swimming across the
70:18 river got dam scorpion strikes him and
70:22 in his last moments of breath the Fox
70:25 turns around of the scorpius's why the
70:27 hell did you sting me said you wouldn't
70:29 do that
70:30 and the scorpion looks at him and says
70:33 I'm so sorry it's my nature and they
70:37 both died if you really think about that
70:41 story and I mean really meditate if you
70:48 can't get it meditate on it sit in a
70:50 room by yourself during this quarantine
70:52 phase and think about this story evil
70:56 people are evil they don't know any
71:00 better right do you think Abramovich is
71:04 ever gonna turn into a saint could she
71:09 possibly well she's 76 now or 73 or
71:12 something like that she's 73 of course
71:15 she looks like she's maybe 48 maybe just
71:21 get a little thicker as she gets older
71:23 but still her skin so smooth Wow the
71:26 adrenal Crone queen looks great and
71:28 surprise surprise do you think she's
71:33 ever gonna not be a scorpion no she's
71:38 gonna be a scorpion until the day she
71:40 dies well how many other names could we
71:44 put on that list is Bill Gates ever
71:47 gonna be anything but a scorpion George
71:49 Soros Kissinger the list goes on and on
71:55 and on and there's plenty of celebrities
71:57 that we all love they're probably
71:59 scorpions definitely a ton of musicians
72:01 that are scorpions
72:04 so you know can you rid the whole world
72:09 the scorpions well maybe not truly
72:10 scorpions but what we want to do and
72:15 this is this is one thing that again
72:18 when the Christians come to my door
72:19 usually they're Mormons that's why I
72:22 always usually treat them with the most
72:24 respect that possibly can because I tell
72:27 them I said look I have slightly
72:31 different way that I get to the top of
72:32 the mountain but I borrow as much as I
72:35 possibly can from your teachings both
72:38 their book and the Bible itself and I
72:42 say look what's cool about moral codes
72:46 when it comes to herd mentality is that
72:50 if we can make being good the standard
72:56 then anyone who is a scorpion
72:59 anyone who's evil sticks out like a sore
73:01 thumb and that's what we need in this
73:05 world it would be ideal if through a
73:12 strong moral code we start to shrink the
73:18 evil pool of course evil is a very
73:20 subjective thing I understand now you
73:23 know there's a difference though let's
73:25 just say of a cultural mean that is like
73:29 pornographic material versus
73:37 adrenochrome
73:38 harvesting out of kids body parts thus
73:41 promoting everything that gets a person
73:43 to abort a child
73:44 so that's they could get the kids but we
73:50 have to understand that one of the
73:52 reasons why probably porn is is
73:55 continued to be pushed on society is
73:58 that it does facilitate a bunch of
74:00 unwanted pregnancies because of the
74:02 obsession with sex outside of any
74:04 marital engagement to have children
74:06 again I think I said this probably four
74:09 or five times one time I went to a
74:11 Planned Parenthood with the girlfriend
74:13 of mine at the time sitting in the lobby
74:14 and there's a chick there just telling
74:18 everybody
74:19 this is not this is not a slam on this
74:21 particular profession okay this I know a
74:24 lot of women twenty five years ago and I
74:27 knew a lot of women in this profession
74:28 we're just fine but she was a stripper
74:32 she told everybody she couldn't stop
74:33 talking and then she bragged it I think
74:36 she was up to like nine abortions or
74:39 something like that and this was just
74:40 her former birth control just you know
74:44 she may have been like a day after kind
74:46 of person or close to but still imagine
74:50 happy that conversation with perhaps you
74:54 bring her home as a girlfriend she's
74:55 telling your mother this and your
74:57 mother's like what are you doing with
74:59 this woman but if your mother was
75:01 Abramovich then she's like oh great can
75:06 you let it go like three or four months
75:08 before it happens I'll pay for it
75:09 pay for your bortion this is the
75:14 standard we have allowed to become our
75:18 society you know most people don't do
75:20 that but you know it's still out there
75:23 I know no one wants a bunch of
75:30 conservative Christians telling you how
75:32 to live your life because that will just
75:34 never stop you know be like it looks
75:36 like my cousin who told her father that
75:37 he was going to hell because he drink
75:39 like the tiny little glasses of wine
75:42 after hailing patients all day absurd so
75:49 we have this sort of duality even in the
75:51 good group over here
75:53 between sort of the checks and balances
75:55 of like you get some liberals that you
75:57 know keep you loose and you got some
75:58 conservatives that kind of keep you
75:59 tight and in between most people are
76:01 dead center but still within that
76:04 paradigm over here but we have
76:06 pro-choice and we have pro-life we still
76:10 have freedom and we still have
76:12 sovereignty we have a constitution and
76:17 we believe in a republic we believe
76:19 we're equal and we don't believe a bunch
76:22 of people should be over us in both
76:24 those situations I mean a pro a
76:27 pro-choice person protesting that they
76:30 have the right to their body is someone
76:32 saying
76:32 that they don't want someone to tell
76:33 them what to do and ironically they're
76:35 also socialists typically and that
76:38 today's thinking what a bunch of people
76:42 over them telling them what to do you
76:45 know I was having a conversation
76:47 yesterday with a friend of mine and we
76:53 were talking about government programs
76:55 because the unemployment thing a lot of
76:59 people having a tremendously difficult
77:01 time getting their unemployment checks
77:03 and getting applications applications
77:05 are being granted but they won't let you
77:08 apply for any weeks you know that you've
77:11 been unemployed so it's all screwed up
77:13 and you can't contact them because
77:14 they're overwhelmed and so it's like
77:15 they're stealing money people pop
77:17 people's pockets when they need the cash
77:18 now more than ever right to make ends
77:21 meet and I said you know isn't it funny
77:24 that the United States military when
77:28 they're not buying $500 toilet seats
77:30 that kind of stuff fun black projects
77:32 but the military seems to really be the
77:35 only government body in the United
77:36 States of America that operates with
77:39 amazing efficiency whether it be for
77:43 good or for bad they managed to make
77:45 [ __ ] work yeah they put a whole crew of
77:49 people on a submarine that goes
77:50 underneath the water for 90 days and
77:51 they just they're just fine they just
77:53 totally fine they do all their daily
77:55 chores just fine if they have to go
77:58 fight a war they do an amazing job at it
78:00 they usually win okay well I have to say
78:05 one of the things that was really
78:06 criticized in America and rightfully so
78:08 20-30 years ago was the DMV's where we
78:10 go to get all of our drivers license and
78:13 car registration today DMVs are pretty
78:15 damn amazing to be honest they're really
78:17 quick but we know that the health care
78:22 system was awful under Obama it's
78:24 horrible the premiums started four times
78:26 higher than your normal premium before
78:29 you knew it two years later was four
78:30 times that you know it was just
78:32 atrocious any type of hospitals ever run
78:36 by the government always lose a bunch of
78:38 people dead it's just nuts right but
78:41 this time around for this scam demmick
78:43 the military moved into all major cities
78:46 set up
78:46 these tent cities with hundreds of beds
78:48 almost like 1,200 beds per thing and
78:50 they only use like New York only used a
78:53 hundred and seventy-nine beds they fold
78:56 the place up and left and I have to say
78:58 I'm not a fan of Governor Cuomo but the
79:01 dude finally threw some props to the
79:04 administration and said the response was
79:06 utterly phenomenal I got the ventilators
79:09 I finally wanted even though I didn't
79:11 need them I got all the help I wanted
79:12 and now the numbers are going down so
79:15 that's good sounds like a good precursor
79:18 to getting all of our freedoms back you
79:20 know but it's literally divided down the
79:23 middle in America I don't know about
79:25 Europe but where you have a liberal
79:27 mayor governor senator house
79:30 representative there trying to keep the
79:32 pandemic going there now passively
79:34 threatening from every orifice they
79:37 possibly can about this impending
79:39 guaranteed second phase doctors are
79:43 finally defecting around the world
79:45 they're throwing watch ease record out
79:48 for the public to see to make sure
79:50 everyone knows this guy was involved
79:52 with the creation of this virus and now
79:54 he's at the White House and someone
79:56 asked me you know why would why would
80:00 Trump let thought she be there and then
80:02 not even know I say by be RX RX Burks
80:07 girl whatever she is why would he let
80:09 these hills into the White House to talk
80:11 to people through the podium and just
80:14 occurred to me like right away if you
80:17 knew the guy was a bad dude and he's
80:20 involved with this whole thing well when
80:23 you want to keep him really close to you
80:25 because how do you communicate with your
80:28 deep state operatives you got to send
80:30 him text messages make phone calls send
80:32 emails work the computer and if you have
80:34 that guy in the White House every single
80:36 day he doesn't get to leave except to go
80:41 to bed maybe then you get to monitor
80:43 that guy like never before he only gets
80:45 a tiny little artery to send all this
80:47 communications but he just put a little
80:49 bit of a warrant a little FISA warrant
80:51 out on the guy cuz he's got this
80:53 background that's bad and you just
80:55 listen to everything the guy he's doing
80:57 you survey him you put like a speaker I
80:59 mean no sir
81:00 microphone those boom microphones on his
81:03 place you just listen to the dude you
81:05 catch him red-handed and you stack it up
81:06 on him
81:07 so when you got to get rid of the dude
81:08 it's just you're a hunter I've got a
81:12 semi truck out back you could just read
81:15 this one piece of paper and send they go
81:16 to jail but if he wants a trial the
81:20 discovery phase will be daunting pretty
81:24 sure you'll take a plea deal so maybe
81:27 that's it
81:30 consequently under the guise of hurting
81:33 there's something called herd immunity a
81:36 TRD immunity and has to do with the fact
81:40 that the more we don't social distance
81:43 the more that we get together and expose
81:46 each other do each other's germs and
81:48 slash viral particles or whatever we get
81:52 to manifest very potent antibodies that
81:57 can beat every strand of this stuff that
82:00 comes around much more efficiently than
82:02 a weak strand
82:03 that'll be grunting some sheep somewhere
82:05 where when they extract out the you know
82:08 the virus out of their blood supply and
82:10 give it to you in some vaccinations will
82:12 be some weak-ass thing or it'll give you
82:14 the virus in the first place when you
82:15 didn't have it if this thing is so
82:18 deadly the interesting thing is is how
82:21 many of you know someone or you've done
82:23 it yourself where you got a flu
82:24 vaccination and immediately you got sick
82:28 as a dog from the flu because today they
82:31 give it to you live baby they give you
82:33 real flu just it's sort of like having a
82:36 chickenpox party but it's called a
82:37 vaccination gel skip the mercury in the
82:39 lumen and then whatever else they've
82:41 hidden inside this thing the herd
82:44 immunity is real and it's being advised
82:46 by top neurologists that have basically
82:49 come out from under this propaganda and
82:51 said look this is just insanity what we
82:54 are doing with social distancing is
82:56 loading the gun with bullets to create
83:01 the second wave distancing will be the
83:04 reason why the second wave happens if it
83:06 happens it'll be interesting the people
83:09 that have protested gone out got hurt
83:11 immunity and get a lot of sunlight on
83:13 their face
83:14 they're eatin well taking their vitamins
83:15 they're easing off sugar they're easing
83:18 off on alcohol he'll be strong as an ox
83:22 here comes this wave and they'll be the
83:24 people that naturally survive regardless
83:27 of what age they are provided they're
83:29 not in a pre-existing situation where
83:31 the life is being threatened by another
83:32 condition what is interesting is a buddy
83:36 of mine called me up like two weeks ago
83:39 and he said that he was in a major major
83:45 health situation earlier this year like
83:48 damn near life-and-death situation but
83:52 he had to go in he had a big breathing
83:55 issue and he had fluid in his lungs and
83:58 there like literally poked a hole in him
83:59 and get the fluid out of his lungs and
84:01 he called me today and he said you know
84:04 what he goes I'm starting to think I had
84:08 this thing because he said that all the
84:10 symptoms I've heard about coronavirus
84:12 and this is in January man it seems like
84:16 it's exactly like what I just went
84:18 through and so you know that may have
84:23 tried to drop it in Hollywood so part of
84:28 this comes out of a conversation I had
84:30 through patreon with one of our patreon
84:33 supporters and she was very insightful
84:35 and she said I noticed that in your
84:38 coronavirus response video towards the
84:41 end you got kind of you know weird you
84:44 know you got a got she thought I sounded
84:48 down and she you know she said I
84:50 definitely sense this huge mood shift
84:52 towards the end and it was it was
84:57 definitely something I decided to do
84:59 consciously on the spot but it was one
85:03 of these things where I'm tired of
85:06 tiptoeing around all of these [ __ ]
85:08 weak people you know oh I gotta wear a
85:13 mask because this guy over here believes
85:15 all this [ __ ] you know they're you
85:19 know I would wear a mask it you know to
85:21 make other people feel comfortable in
85:23 certain situations but not just some
85:25 blatant thing I've got
85:26 package of them in my car that family
85:30 member of mine created and sent to Mesa
85:32 if anybody gives me crap Lowe's oh yeah
85:34 you know I got one in the car sorry or
85:38 when you walk into a drugstore you could
85:39 be like I'm here to buy a mask you have
85:41 an e cuz I'm I need some that's why I'm
85:43 here don't yell at me you know and so
85:48 this is an extension of that whole
85:51 thought process at the end of that
85:53 episode because I'm I'm geez I'm not
85:59 anything special right now in fact there
86:02 was this massive protest okay in
86:04 Huntington Beach it is still being used
86:07 the photographs from that event are
86:09 being used in Russian news it went
86:12 international
86:13 this little protest they had downtown
86:15 because Orange County is very very very
86:19 patriotic County and we have everything
86:23 in this county we have every race and
86:26 ample supply we have every orientation
86:29 and ample supply everybody gets along we
86:32 have totally religious people we have
86:35 completely non-religious people
86:37 everyone's getting along and so this is
86:41 a very magical place to be I mean I
86:43 think I lucked out because being in and
86:46 II like being in downtown LA would have
86:48 been atrocious man I mean you have to
86:50 wear a mask o to give you a grand fine
86:53 you know my buddy
86:56 one of my buddies lives north the guy
86:58 was talking about he's having issues
87:02 because he moved to this kind of remote
87:05 nice area next to a lake but he's living
87:08 with a bunch of ex Hollywood people who
87:11 are like on a boat okay on a boat in the
87:15 middle of the lake just two people
87:17 husband and wife or partners or whatever
87:20 and there were in masks and he's like
87:22 what the [ __ ] is the point and then of a
87:24 boat man what do you think is gonna
87:26 happen to you you know so anyway the
87:29 Huntington Beach thing happened
87:31 uh I was obviously free that day but had
87:36 no idea that that was happening down
87:37 there
87:37 would have been great to go down and
87:39 witness that with my own two eyes I
87:40 don't know how you even get notified
87:43 that that's happening you know
87:44 apparently I don't belong to the right
87:46 Facebook group or whatever but what's
87:51 great is some of the most influential
87:53 brilliant people at least in America are
87:56 up on all their social media they have
87:59 hundreds of thousands of followers and
88:01 they're fighting they're fighting the
88:03 data they're fighting these notion that
88:05 we're gonna lose all of our rights and
88:06 they're like not on my watch man and we
88:09 need every single person to heard with
88:13 that mentality keep your eyes open
88:15 they will attempt a second wave they may
88:20 even attempt something that's super
88:21 deadly they may they definitely want to
88:24 win and they just found out that boy
88:26 just telling people what to do sure
88:30 hurted a lot of people they got a bunch
88:32 of like you know low IQ cops to go out
88:37 there and violate the Constitution
88:38 United States just unbelievable that
88:43 your Charter and life is to protect the
88:45 Constitution with your mind body and
88:47 soul and all they have to do is get a
88:50 phone call from their precinct captain
88:52 or whatever the [ __ ] gives out these
88:54 orders like oh okay well that whole oath
88:57 of the reef uh can reason why I have
88:58 this job in the first place is just out
89:00 the door okay well if I where's your
89:05 boss you'd be fired and you'd never be
89:07 allowed to be in any law enforcement for
89:09 the rest of your life because you can't
89:10 keep a promise to your job I don't
89:13 dislike you or anything but I just don't
89:15 think you have what it takes you don't
89:17 have the moxie so hold up to the
89:19 Constitution then people want to go
89:22 outside you just gotta say well I can't
89:26 stop you it's a free country and if you
89:29 get that virus and you die then it's
89:32 your own damn fault there you go the
89:35 risk is yours and why is that because
89:37 that comp isn't any higher up in the
89:40 world especially of God and the universe
89:43 than you
89:45 it's not the case now again we have laws
89:50 that we have all agreed on that we have
89:53 ratified with two-thirds majority it's
89:55 called the Constitution so don't give me
89:57 this crap that awesome we're gonna go to
89:59 a lawless world if we allow that
90:00 behavior to to manifest these people are
90:05 breaking new laws
90:06 quite the opposite they are enjoying
90:09 their laws they are following their laws
90:13 but you know I the good news is is that
90:16 everything's opening back up again but
90:18 these people are in these governors and
90:20 you know whatever mayors and stuff are
90:22 trying to they're just their hubris is
90:24 off the chain and they're power-hungry
90:27 minds are off the chain then they use
90:29 this liberal excuse that they're saving
90:31 your life by engaging tyranny on top of
90:35 you by taking away all of your freedoms
90:37 right seriously man you know and I made
90:43 a criticism of the fact that the TSA
90:45 became a permanent fixture in the
90:47 airports and I here's the thing I should
90:51 have clarified it was my fault do the
90:54 person who sort of clarified the
90:56 position on YouTube I appreciate your
90:59 comment we have always had security at
91:02 airports folks always the one thing that
91:06 had nothing to do with security that I
91:08 actually loved after 9/11 is that there
91:12 used to be like the situation where a
91:13 college kid would you know be flying to
91:16 a university out of state
91:19 and I'm just gonna pick out my own kind
91:21 these hillbilly families with like 42
91:24 [ __ ] family members would follow the
91:26 kid all the way to the gate and take up
91:29 all the seating for one [ __ ] kid just
91:32 so they can say goodbye the second they
91:33 go through the door jam them down the
91:35 you know the hallway to the plane
91:38 ah that [ __ ] needed to end a long time
91:41 ago and it finally did because that's
91:44 just unfair to people paying thousands
91:46 of dollars for the seat to wait so they
91:48 can get on the plane right that's the
91:51 only thing I totally love about the
91:52 change with that whole thing was just a
91:53 dumb policy that everyone was like yeah
91:55 come on in but international airports
91:56 before 9/11 stopped you you couldn't go
91:59 any further and I remember saying
92:01 goodbye to my exchange student
92:04 girlfriend back in 1990 it was pretty
92:07 gut-wrenching and it was for some reason
92:08 it was like gut-wrenching that she was
92:10 still there she was gonna be waiting
92:11 three hours and anyway but we've always
92:15 had security we have those door jambs
92:17 which worked for the Superbowl worked
92:20 for the Olympics worked for every major
92:22 league game in the world and and no
92:24 one's blowing up in the middle of a
92:28 stadium right it's bad enough that 9/11
92:32 wasn't was a false flag but now that
92:36 you've got to get body scanned because
92:38 of some made-up bunch of [ __ ] where
92:42 no one's I mean you know bombs get put
92:44 on planes by people who have access to
92:48 the underside of the plane there the
92:50 baggage get it they get one of their
92:52 operatives to become a baggage control
92:54 person and then someone puts them
92:55 outside the fence or however the hell
92:57 they do it they get it on the plane then
92:59 poof it goes away okay but sitting there
93:04 you know scrutinizing again toothpaste
93:07 I can't bring one of these lighters
93:09 right here on the plane in my bag
93:12 because it's so hot I guess I could burn
93:15 the whole plane down I mean give me a
93:16 [ __ ] break but let's just remember
93:18 you have to take your shoes off because
93:20 the guy put firecrackers in his shoe and
93:22 didn't blow up the plane that would have
93:24 never blown up the plane because the
93:25 thing he built in his shoes was a joke
93:27 but you have to take your shoes off now
93:29 because of that kid a big oaf II [ __ ]
93:32 dude okay
93:34 second thing you can't bring toothpaste
93:36 or water or liquids over a certain size
93:38 because of a complete botched
93:40 arrest in London for a flight that was
93:44 going to be coming to New York every guy
93:46 was dismissed or it had all charges
93:49 cancelled because they didn't have
93:50 any bomb-making materials and their and
93:53 their goods it was all of it was all a
93:56 overreaction of the police in London and
93:59 now the whole planet can't take certain
94:02 liquid containers on a plane false flag
94:05 just like the Gulf of Tonkin it starts
94:07 the Vietnam War just like the false flag
94:10 of Pearl Harbor it throws us into the
94:14 war I mean we didn't need these things
94:21 to make good decisions to stop these
94:23 things from occurring you know now when
94:26 you go to Disneyland I don't know how
94:30 many people have been in the last five
94:32 years I don't even know if that place
94:33 will ever open back up again you know
94:36 how do you how do you have social
94:37 distancing on a [ __ ] amusement park
94:40 ride you sit like it's the whole thing
94:43 of sitting in sardine cans and going
94:46 around right well when you go in today
94:49 they check everything out you go through
94:52 a metal detector you do it exactly the
94:55 old-school airports and it works but
94:58 they are going through everybody's bags
95:00 and it takes forever they're not smart
95:03 enough to make bag people go on a bag
95:04 line everybody's just carrying their
95:06 keys and your wallet going through the
95:07 your cell phone going through some
95:09 faster line freedoms are up for sale man
95:17 so you know I'd be interested in your
95:21 observations you know we really really
95:24 really need to communicate right now and
95:26 I will say that our our locked facebook
95:28 group is just therapy I mean it's
95:34 beautiful peace or making light of
95:36 certain things that we can make light of
95:38 or analyzing data I mean everyone's like
95:42 a really good hearted researcher it's
95:44 it's beautiful like when you have to
95:46 follow like those lar P things like Q
95:48 and on all these and nods you don't know
95:50 who they are they could be other shilly
95:52 operatives and all this other crap right
95:54 it's not like we couldn't have a [ __ ]
95:56 but what ends up happening in our locked
95:58 facebook group is the people end up
95:59 friending each other and having personal
96:01 conversations and they realize
96:04 this guy really went down the rabbit
96:06 hole over here so he will come in and
96:09 post a bunch of stuff this you know
96:12 investigating deciphering things giving
96:15 us more links they're their own anons
96:17 rate and then this woman over here she
96:19 goes down a separate rabbit hole and
96:22 everyone's got their eyes open and
96:24 what's nice about it is I am I'm the
96:26 luckiest guy in the world because I get
96:28 to be at the center of all of you
96:30 communicating pause yeah all the
96:33 Facebook Earth's are the YouTube
96:34 comments which the only unfortunate
96:38 thing about the YouTube comments let's
96:40 put this way if you put a lot of effort
96:41 into YouTube comments and a lot of you
96:43 do and I can't thank you enough
96:46 you really gotta get over and just
96:49 create a little account if you do create
96:50 a fresh account like you created it the
96:53 day you join the Facebook group cuz you
96:54 don't like Facebook totally get that
96:56 till I respect that do let us know you
97:00 know because I see there's a little
97:01 question when you join it says say
97:03 something human if you can if you've got
97:06 a really fresh profile definitely write
97:08 something in there saying look I just
97:10 created this account just so I could be
97:11 a part of this group that way we know
97:13 your Facebook feed has nothing on it
97:15 because there's a lot of fake accounts
97:17 being put up there truthfully if you
97:21 have nothing on your Facebook account
97:22 including your profile pic just just
97:24 find some stupid thing that you like
97:26 your favorite movie character or
97:28 whatever put his your profile so you
97:29 don't have a dead profile image because
97:31 that makes you suspect right away but
97:32 once you're in you're in well I should
97:34 have conversations it's great which
97:40 brings me to the close which would be
97:41 deep thoughts radio.com is where you can
97:44 find all these links the I'm going to
97:49 give you a long bumper today because I
97:50 want to describe a few things for you
97:52 obviously the two youtubes that are
97:55 working there are all up-to-date
97:57 typically is [ __ ] shoots a little bit
97:59 behind YouTube because I use YouTube to
98:01 decode it from 4k down to 1080p and
98:05 sometimes I'm just uploading and then I
98:07 go to bed or I upload and go do
98:09 something with my life and then I have
98:11 to come back several hours later maybe a
98:12 couple days later and grab it down and
98:14 move it up but we have bright tea on up
98:17 there
98:18 well but god bless them they just can't
98:21 get their thing right it's all censored
98:24 it's censored by design you have to have
98:26 you have to be popular on bright T on to
98:28 get the amount of videos we need up
98:30 there right plenty of podcasting up
98:34 there you can download the mp3s if you
98:37 want directly from the website listen to
98:40 them on whatever device you have we have
98:43 again for social media so LOX Facebook
98:45 group definitely recommended Twitter I
98:47 mean if you like Twitter I'm tweeting a
98:49 little bit again I find it to be too
98:52 acidic to really put much time into it
98:54 my only falsity with Twitter is I try to
98:57 up vote with little heart folks that I
99:01 support and sometimes I tell you what I
99:04 will like something that is good
99:08 spirited even if I don't believe exactly
99:10 what that person believes but I feel
99:12 like it's gonna do a greater good
99:13 you'll be have mine's calm Gabe calm
99:16 which are the two competitors to
99:17 Facebook mine's calm I'll keep saying it
99:19 it's beautiful it's great
99:22 I'm sure dart Pro will make sure they
99:24 never get any money to to expand but we
99:26 move over there go get the funding we
99:31 have a couple ways to donate obviously
99:32 patreon and PayPal PayPal you're
99:34 completely anonymous if you want to do
99:35 that patreon you get early access to the
99:38 videos you get chats with me guess it's
99:43 just such a small group that's just easy
99:44 people chat me and I chat back and so I
99:47 have my you know weeks right chat you
99:50 guys up another week so I'll disappear
99:52 so I apologize in advance I've got all
99:55 these different arteries I try to pay
99:56 attention to brave browsers up there -
100:01 you've got to get up with a pretty
100:03 browser switch - DuckDuckGo instead of
100:05 Google it'll erase all the metrics out
100:07 of the deep state it's fantastic dr. Koh
100:11 keeps no logs on what you do so it
100:13 doesn't remember anything you've ever
100:14 done ever which is great
100:16 the times are tough so I understand if
100:20 you don't hurry cache don't even sweat
100:22 it we have a store a couple t-shirts
100:26 couple like you can get one design and a
100:29 bunch of different things and one just a
100:30 t-shirt
100:31 it's going to disappear right after the
100:33 season's finished we have all new
100:36 remastered season 1 so that's episode 1
100:38 through 100 plus for special reports I
100:40 believe not all 100 episodes are there
100:42 but something like missing 2 or 3 and
100:45 that's about it so let me know what you
100:48 think about all this but in the meantime
100:50 take care of yourself and somebody else
100:52 and I'll see you in the next deep
100:53 thoughts over now
100:58 [Applause]
101:04 [Applause]
