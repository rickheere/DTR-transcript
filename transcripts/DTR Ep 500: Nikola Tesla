00:30 all right ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:31 back to deep thoughts we are now
00:33 finally going to do this tesla episode
00:37 and i think you guys know that uh who
00:39 watch this show regularly
00:41 out of 500 and probably 30 episodes it's
00:45 actually probably about 555 but i
00:47 turned some off for 45.
00:50 i've rarely ever taken notes because
00:54 just don't need them or just riffing
00:56 right but probably about six episodes
00:58 that really
01:00 utilize notes usually an outline form
01:03 this particular episode
01:05 has 30 pages of notes okay
01:08 about this guy's life
01:12 now the way we're going to do this
01:13 episode is that we're going to talk
01:15 about
01:15 essentially three stages of tesla's life
01:19 and it's going to travel in sort of
01:23 who he was as a kid growing up because
01:26 this is a very
01:28 important stage of his life not all
01:29 people that turn out to be
01:31 geniuses have as
01:35 many formative moments in their youth
01:38 as tesla but he had a ton
01:42 and so we're gonna go through that
01:45 and then we're gonna get into his
01:46 inventions and how he evolved
01:49 the ac motor and um
01:52 wireless transmission and then
01:56 we're going to get into sort of the
01:58 twilight years of his life
02:00 where he starts being concerned
02:03 about war because in the chronology of
02:06 his life
02:08 he didn't have war around him
02:11 as much he knew about wars going on the
02:13 world but this is where
02:15 he takes his technology and starts
02:18 talking about the death ray
02:20 and before we get even there i'm just
02:22 going to give you a little preview
02:25 when i got into the tesla death ray
02:28 theory
02:29 i went online i watched as many youtube
02:31 videos i could find they're all awful
02:33 they're all partial they all treat it
02:34 like a mystery they treat it like
02:36 maybe he created it maybe he didn't the
02:39 truth of matter is when you go through
02:40 his life
02:41 he talked about it a lot at length for
02:44 almost
02:45 15 years so he definitely had a
02:48 conceived
02:49 i've got paperwork i'm going to show you
02:52 of his
02:52 illustrations of what it might be before
02:55 we get there
02:56 we're going to talk about how this thing
02:59 evolved
03:00 through his other technologies let's
03:04 begin
03:07 so he's born july 10th 1856
03:10 in what is now modern croatia which was
03:14 i think it's pronounced milkham austrian
03:17 empire
03:19 so today it's called croatia
03:22 and within about uh six years
03:25 the family moved to gaspik which is
03:28 another
03:29 city over there his father was an
03:31 orthodox priest
03:34 and so you know we talk about that we
03:38 have to track the fact that that is
03:40 going to be a
03:42 a religious household and
03:46 what's interesting is is you know i've
03:48 probably consumed at least three books
03:50 now
03:52 uh one all about the tesla coil and
03:54 exactly how that thing works
03:55 but very little of it talked about
03:59 some things that i eventually found him
04:02 quoted as saying i mean
04:04 i guess but through his entire 1919
04:06 biography he doesn't talk about it but
04:09 religion supposedly played a huge role
04:11 in how he discovered things and saw
04:13 things
04:15 but now 1863 he's seven years old
04:18 and his brother dies in a horse accident
04:21 it's his older brother
04:23 and the way he describes this is that
04:26 his older brother was sort of the prized
04:28 possession of the family
04:30 now of course it's the firstborn but in
04:33 terms of
04:34 you know accomplishing things and
04:37 you know just being a good mama's boy
04:39 and daddy's boy
04:40 that was his brother he felt like he
04:43 wasn't
04:44 as as celebrated as his brother
04:48 so when it all turned to him there was
04:51 in his opinion
04:52 in his biography his autobiography
04:55 he said that there was sort of this
04:57 macabre you know like oh
04:59 god we only have nicola now
05:02 again his name is nikolai um but we're
05:05 going to call him tesla several times in
05:06 the show not to be confused with the
05:08 usception of his name
05:09 in the electric car company
05:13 now very early on in his life and this
05:15 is what's really trippy for me and for
05:17 those of you who watch deep dots
05:18 regularly
05:20 this will trip you out a little bit
05:22 tesla talked about in his autobiography
05:24 that when he was young
05:25 at the age of seven up he started to see
05:30 alternate realities overlaid on this
05:32 life
05:33 and uh all i could say is it matches 100
05:36 the description of the episode i did on
05:38 the exact same subject where i see the
05:40 same thing i mean there's probably
05:43 just an estimation about five realities
05:46 that i see every once in a while they're
05:47 overlaid on this reality has to do with
05:49 time of day and where i am locally but
05:51 he mentioned the same thing as a young
05:52 man which i thought was pretty
05:54 fascinating
05:55 now he also said that you know as a
05:57 child he built up this capability of
05:59 really seeing things in his mind super
06:01 vividly almost
06:02 uh as another reality not to be confused
06:05 with the ones that he sees but
06:07 he was able to manifest a place in his
06:09 mind that was just as productive as the
06:11 one that he has in the real world
06:13 such that he could invent things and
06:15 test things
06:16 but this didn't happen later in life
06:18 this happened pretty much at the
06:20 precipice where a human being starts to
06:22 become
06:23 aware that they're alive which is really
06:25 by the age of seven i think most of us
06:27 start to remember
06:29 you know the majority of the years that
06:30 were alive you know the
06:32 the time and the events that take place
06:34 within a particular year
06:37 but he also noticed that he started
06:39 having these
06:40 weird pet peeves which will become
06:43 a fairly large part of his life and very
06:47 cumbersome in his life
06:48 where you've heard a lot of the adhd
06:50 sort of
06:51 um things you have compulsive disorders
06:54 and what have you one of the first ones
06:56 that he ever noticed
06:58 was that hair freaked him out
07:01 and so he he ended up
07:06 just noticing this about himself really
07:07 really quickly
07:09 he also noticed things like i mean to
07:11 put to give you some examples he
07:13 mentioned
07:14 at one point in his life he would tear
07:15 up squares of paper
07:17 and throw him in the water just to see
07:19 where they went
07:20 and he said when he saw this it would
07:22 give him a taste in his mouth
07:25 just seeing that event occur very very
07:28 interesting right
07:30 at this early age he also started
07:32 counting his steps
07:35 and you know most of us when we're
07:36 little kids we'll start playing that
07:38 little step
07:38 game at the mall or when there's cracks
07:40 in the sidewalk if someone told us a
07:42 nursery rhyme if we step on it we heard
07:44 our mother's back
07:44 that kind of thing well he was starting
07:46 to have this at a pretty intense rate
07:47 without any
07:48 provocation or nursery rhymes
07:52 it became so bad that later in life but
07:55 started very early that if he didn't
07:58 complete a certain number of steps
08:00 prior to moving into his
08:03 dinner cycle or any type of eating cycle
08:05 he couldn't enjoy his food
08:07 the steps that he took this is for his
08:10 own words right this is not a rumor
08:12 had to be divisible by three very very
08:15 interesting
08:16 it was almost as if he had to satiate a
08:18 circuit in his mind
08:20 to function in life
08:25 and he said that uh at times when he got
08:27 older it would take up
08:29 hours of his day trying to figure out a
08:31 way to walk in a way that he wouldn't
08:33 take an extra step and bust his
08:34 divisible by three
08:37 it's really interesting he should have
08:38 created dance moves where he could
08:39 always add one two or three and that way
08:41 he'd be able to balance it out
08:43 but he said up until about the age of
08:45 eight that he felt
08:47 like a very weak person he felt very
08:49 physically weak
08:50 and this sort of played into his
08:52 character which probably drove his
08:53 parents nuts
08:55 who were very religious who had
08:56 installed a lot of fears in his system
08:58 superstitious beliefs to the point where
09:02 at a very early age he was sort of
09:03 afraid of the dark he would manifest
09:05 monsters in any type of dark closet or
09:08 something which a lot of
09:09 little kids do but we have scary shows
09:12 on tv
09:12 scary movies we see and adults that have
09:15 seen those
09:16 who might pre-program us with that he
09:18 was seeing it
09:19 just out of the void of his life
09:24 now one of the first things that
09:25 happened to him was that he had
09:27 a father who loved books and he said his
09:31 father had a pretty
09:32 large book collection at home which
09:36 his father actually would catch him
09:38 reading
09:39 and uh said basically he shouldn't
09:42 read so much and i think the tense of it
09:44 was he wasn't going outside
09:46 which in the 1800s would be really
09:48 really weird right i mean he doesn't
09:49 have a police station
09:50 a computer something to mess with and so
09:53 his father would run around the house
09:55 and try to hide the candles so he
09:57 couldn't read at night
09:59 but he would always find a way to uh
10:04 to figure this out he would actually go
10:05 up to the door of his bedroom and plug
10:07 the keyhole
10:08 so if his father looked the keyhole he
10:10 wouldn't see any light in the room and
10:12 he would sneak a candle in there and
10:13 start reading
10:16 so there was a hungarian writer named
10:18 abafi abafi
10:21 and this is one of the series of books
10:23 that he ended up getting his hands on
10:25 and he said that within that writer i
10:26 haven't read the books
10:28 but that he really got a sense of
10:31 self-awareness awakening this is all the
10:34 age of seven okay
10:36 and you know beyond that point too but
10:38 it also gave him a massive level of
10:39 self-control
10:40 so he sees that as a moment where he
10:43 starts to control his own mind in a way
10:45 that he became
10:46 very professional as a young man
10:49 one of the first things that he ended up
10:52 falling in love with
10:53 as he became very mathematical prior to
10:56 really attending
10:58 super mathematical classes and then as
10:59 he became more and more educated it
11:01 became
11:03 more and more intense to the point he
11:04 was really good at it then he did start
11:06 losing as well was
11:07 playing cards for those of you know
11:09 anything about
11:10 you know poker what have you you know
11:12 these people can count cards
11:14 see what the cards that have been dealt
11:16 see what you have in your hand do some
11:18 calculations on how people are playing
11:20 and figure whether or not those winning
11:22 cards are in someone else's hand are
11:23 still in the in the dealer's deck
11:26 so that'll play a huge role in his
11:29 future
11:29 now at the age of 14 he moves to uh
11:33 carl levac k-a-r-l-o-v-a-c
11:39 at the age of 17 he contracts cholera
11:44 and that was a very formative moment
11:47 because he's stuck in bed
11:50 and so he spends a bit of time in bed
11:54 a few months and that starts to kind of
11:57 i've heard it described in different
11:58 books
11:58 a book about him that he really
12:01 described the
12:02 sickness as almost going in a broken
12:04 person
12:05 and coming out of it being completely
12:07 reborn in terms of his grasp of all
12:10 things like it was as if the sickness
12:12 was essentially re-engineering his mind
12:15 very interesting he put a lot of
12:16 conspiracies together
12:18 but the playing card thing at the age of
12:20 17 started getting completely out of
12:22 hand where he was
12:23 losing tons of money and trying to
12:25 perfect his prediction technology
12:28 in his mind he was just losing every
12:30 penny he would earn
12:31 and eventually a very important thing
12:34 occurs
12:35 which i think is probably one of the
12:37 coolest things a parent
12:38 could have ever done for any kid his
12:41 father learns that he's losing money
12:43 and so his father's like on him you know
12:46 heavily to stop him from doing this and
12:48 his mother figured out
12:50 what he was doing and so on one evening
12:54 his father had forbid him to borrow any
12:57 more money
12:57 to spending the kill i think he'd blown
12:59 all through his own cash but his mother
13:01 brought him the family savings
13:04 and she gave him all the money that they
13:06 have
13:08 to go play cards
13:11 and he asked his mother you know uh
13:14 why are you doing this you know dad
13:16 doesn't want me to do this why are you
13:17 doing this and she says well i know how
13:19 men
13:19 behave she goes the sooner you can get
13:22 through this addiction
13:23 the sooner you'll become whoever you're
13:25 supposed to be
13:26 and that little statement from his
13:28 mother was so ultra profound
13:31 that he saw the whole thing finally for
13:33 what it was which is an addiction
13:34 and a door like an endorphin
13:38 addiction and he immediately quit
13:41 playing cards for the rest of his life
13:44 so the age of 18 in a another
13:48 fit of refinements for himself uh he
13:51 managed to elude
13:52 i guess mandatory army service
13:56 which you know you can do that one way
13:57 or the other we definitely got some
13:59 benefits out of this guy
14:00 being able to skip going into the
14:03 military but he
14:04 eventually stops smoking because he ends
14:07 up
14:08 suffering from some heart issues which i
14:10 don't know quite how you do that
14:12 in 1874 but he was able to determine
14:16 that about himself
14:17 and knock it off so he goes off to
14:20 college at 19
14:22 1875 and he goes to a town called gratz
14:26 graz it was a polytech school
14:30 and he ends up having a nervous
14:31 breakdown at 19 years old
14:34 and he just basically said that he saw
14:37 so much opportunity
14:38 in school that it was one of these
14:40 situations where he wanted to do it all
14:43 and so he also attempts to become
14:46 an inventor and he said that was
14:49 initially one of the most excruciating
14:51 processes of his life he described it as
14:53 agony
14:54 becoming an inventor and i want you guys
14:57 to remember that because
14:58 as you attempt new things in your life
14:59 and it's very very difficult
15:01 i want you just to say to yourself well
15:03 nikola tesla felt the exact same way
15:05 and he became one of the most important
15:08 inventors in human history
15:11 but what he did was um he said that you
15:14 know from the age of seven and
15:16 up he had forced himself to the best of
15:19 his ability with the intellect that he
15:20 had at that age to become what he calls
15:23 a deep
15:23 thinker what a great show for him to be
15:26 on right now right
15:28 but he says that people focus on i mean
15:29 just listen to this this is uh
15:31 him lamenting at 1875
15:37 that he goes people focus on stuff
15:39 outside their life so much they don't
15:40 know a thing about themselves
15:43 and he goes that is a common mistake
15:46 which
15:46 causes people to avoid their own
15:48 imagination
15:50 how poetic in 2020 is that statement
15:53 today
15:55 and he said that one of the things that
15:57 was sort of
15:58 an epiphany a statement that he said to
16:00 himself was that
16:03 he found out that everything that
16:04 applies to the individual applies to
16:07 the whole society as a whole so that
16:10 whole thing about you know we talk about
16:11 on the show a lot do no harm
16:14 he figured that that should apply to the
16:17 rest of the world
16:18 the one thing that you will find in all
16:20 of tesla's writings
16:22 and pretty much every believable source
16:25 about him is that you're talking about a
16:27 guy
16:29 who had some of the highest morals on
16:32 planet earth
16:33 tesla was a nice guy his entire life
16:38 which will lead to his big invention at
16:40 least in theory
16:42 on paper in his later years
16:47 so at the age of 22 he moves to maribor
16:52 but what happens is by the age of 23 the
16:55 next year
16:56 he ends up getting deported from mordor
16:59 back to
17:00 um the gospic where he's from because he
17:02 didn't have
17:03 residency in the city so it was very
17:05 interesting that he got deported
17:08 at the uh pretty much right after he got
17:12 there
17:14 but in april 17 1879 same year
17:18 his father passes away his father's only
17:22 60 years old
17:23 and they really don't know what he died
17:25 of
17:27 and while in gossip he ends up teaching
17:29 at this
17:30 famous location of his life called the
17:32 real gymnasium
17:34 and he's surrounded by friends of the
17:37 family
17:38 and he's teaching but he sort of
17:40 realizes well
17:42 if i'm going to teach i'm not going to
17:44 invent so he realizes right away
17:48 he doesn't mind teaching but he needs
17:49 that to be the
17:51 ancillary thing to his life and not the
17:52 main thing that he's doing
17:55 so at the age of 24 in 1888 he moves to
17:58 prague
18:00 so uh tesla had two uncles peter and
18:04 pavlov and they funded the money
18:08 for him to get to prague he had to
18:10 arrive exactly at 1880 because
18:14 he enrolls in a school
18:17 and he unfortunately didn't know
18:21 greek which was the primary language
18:24 that they taught in
18:25 i guess some of these languages and he
18:27 didn't speak or write check
18:29 which is a huge problem for the school
18:32 he ends up spending most of his time in
18:34 a local library
18:36 where he just starts consuming
18:40 real technology as it was probably a
18:43 faraday owned
18:44 situation up to that point
18:48 at the age of 25 in 1881 he starts
18:50 working at budapest
18:52 at the age of 26 in 1882 this is
18:54 important
18:56 he has what he calls is his alternating
18:58 current epiphany
19:01 now again at the time ac was understood
19:04 to be a possibility but it wasn't
19:06 something that people knew how to
19:08 conquer so direct current was the only
19:10 thing that
19:12 was being utilized in
19:15 most of the areas of the world now there
19:16 were some ac motors out there but they
19:18 were just really inefficient had issues
19:20 so of course edison back in america is
19:23 creating the edison power company
19:25 and that's where he'll end up here very
19:27 shortly
19:31 so he's hanging out with the buddy of
19:32 his in budapest and they're on a walk
19:34 watching the sunset
19:37 and he was reciting a passage from faust
19:42 and for some reason this epiphany comes
19:44 to him
19:45 he sees the machine for the very first
19:48 time and then
19:49 at the end of the walk literally rushes
19:52 to a place where you can write down this
19:53 diagram
19:54 of this machine that will be the
19:56 cornerstone of cracking
19:58 the ac motor as we get into his patents
20:01 you're going to understand that there
20:02 was
20:02 a ton of patents that needed to
20:06 to occur to refine every single aspect
20:09 of an ec motor
20:10 otherwise it wasn't going to work
20:14 so this is when he and his buddy anthony
20:16 did a job at the continental edison
20:18 company which was centered in paris
20:21 and the company's main contract was with
20:24 the paris opera house
20:26 where they were installing lighting
20:28 using the direct
20:29 current ac motors and this is where he
20:32 started
20:33 submitting improvements for the edison
20:35 dinos
20:37 and this is the system by which the
20:39 power is generated in the dc
20:41 motor and there's a story where he was
20:44 supposed to be compensated for his
20:46 improvement submissions
20:48 and it never happened because he was
20:50 disposed to strasbourg
20:52 before the payment was awarded so he
20:53 kind of got screwed out of that payment
20:55 again he's a nice guy and he loves life
20:57 and so he just yeah whatever i'll make
20:59 money some other way
21:02 so in 1883 he spends most of his time in
21:04 strasbourg and he's repairing
21:07 motors for the military for the german
21:11 railway company where a motor had been
21:15 basically damaged
21:16 on the train rail and again
21:19 he gets uh shafted out of his
21:22 compensation
21:23 but in the same year he demonstrates
21:26 to the uh former mayor of strasbourg
21:30 the first ac motor that he had come up
21:33 with and he demonstrated it to the mayor
21:35 plus a bunch of local scientists
21:37 who eagerly watched what he was doing
21:39 but they so completely didn't understand
21:41 what he was doing they just kind of went
21:42 oh that was great well i guess maybe
21:44 this will
21:45 eventually do something which we have a
21:47 lot of that in today's day where you
21:49 have these amazing inventors who put
21:50 together something they show it off to
21:52 someone
21:52 and if no one's interested investing you
21:55 can't really take it anywhere can you
21:56 right so the big big year for us
22:01 was in 1884 at the age of 28
22:06 with money from his uncles he ends up
22:08 traveling to america
22:11 now his trip over to america was
22:14 anything
22:15 but an easy little ride it was a four
22:17 week journey
22:19 or i guess to say like for a few weeks
22:22 the um
22:23 the ship had a huge mutiny on it big
22:26 dispute big physical
22:28 uh mutiny there's talk where tesla said
22:31 that he nearly got thrown overboard
22:33 but he ended up keeping his cool but the
22:36 problem was
22:37 after he had bought his ticket all his
22:39 money and his luggage were stolen
22:41 during the mutiny so by the time he
22:43 arrives
22:44 he has four cents in his pocket
22:47 now the account of him arriving in new
22:50 york
22:51 from his autobiography uh
22:54 is much more detailed than other
22:56 accounts of his life but then i read
22:58 even another book that it supports this
22:59 other account so he is coming off the
23:02 boat he knows he's supposed to walk down
23:03 the street and get to the edison company
23:05 he's got no money and so he finds a boat
23:10 locally that has some some generator
23:12 problems
23:14 and he offers to fix it now the
23:18 i've heard widely different
23:22 claims about the amount of money he was
23:24 supposed to be compensated now again
23:25 this is 1884.
23:27 the initial number that i heard
23:30 years ago was about 4 500 bucks
23:35 a recent book that i read had it all the
23:38 way up to like fifty four thousand
23:39 dollars which seems absolutely absurd
23:41 because back in those days that would be
23:44 you know
23:45 jp morgan kind of money in terms of a
23:47 kid walking into new york
23:48 but he gets to new york and ends up
23:51 working for the edison company and
23:53 edison is immediately
23:54 smitten by his intelligence he is able
23:57 to fix things
23:59 and improve them in ways that were
24:02 almost
24:03 just fluid and here's edison who's been
24:05 staring at the problem and it's probably
24:07 one of those situations where
24:08 you're too close to the problem and so
24:10 you can only see it one way
24:12 or a few ways and you can't see it
24:14 through different eyes and so tesla
24:16 comes in with his ac mind
24:18 and dc was just child's play so he gets
24:21 assigned to a ship called the oregon
24:24 where he starts to fix everything was
24:26 one of the first ships that had electric
24:27 lighting
24:28 on it and what's interesting is all of
24:30 these dc motors no matter where they
24:31 ended up always seem to have problems
24:33 that's just how innovative they were and
24:36 so the
24:38 longevity of one of these motors in my
24:39 opinion seems to be very short
24:42 and also suffers from probably a lot of
24:44 the
24:46 the environmental impacts like anything
24:48 on a boat
24:49 is being exposed to salted air 24 7 and
24:52 salts just horrible for
24:54 mechanics so that may have played a role
24:56 in that
24:58 but while tesla's working for edison
25:01 in this first year he ends up inventing
25:04 24 different machines
25:07 to better utilize the dc power supply
25:10 and those became standard in the edison
25:12 company
25:13 long after tesla left the edison company
25:19 so one year later tesla
25:22 exits the edison company because he
25:25 can't get
25:26 edison to co-invest in ac it's going to
25:28 give
25:29 edison the whole thing he's like i'll
25:30 just work for you you pay for it i'll do
25:32 ac research here
25:34 you can see i know how to do all your dc
25:35 stuff i assure you this will work
25:37 i've already demonstrated it overseas
25:40 and he won't have any of it so in 1885
25:44 tesla forms the tesla tesla electric
25:46 light company
25:48 now this transition is a little bit
25:52 um gray because what ends up occurring
25:55 is that uh
25:58 tesla forms this company he gets some
26:01 investors in the company
26:02 and he ends up creating a bunch of
26:04 different lighting mechanisms that work
26:06 great
26:08 and the investors essentially pulled a
26:10 fast one on him took his company away
26:12 from them
26:12 from him and all he was left with like
26:14 were you know worthless stock
26:16 certificates which was
26:18 one of the hardest blows he said in his
26:19 entire life
26:21 over at the edison company where again
26:22 it's the separation is starting to occur
26:26 apparently edison promised him fifty
26:28 thousand dollars if he could improve
26:30 the performance of the dc dinos right
26:33 and he succeeds he succeeds beyond the
26:35 expectations of edison
26:37 and of course edison being the pos that
26:40 he is
26:41 renig's on the deal and tells tesla that
26:43 it was all just a joke and the tesla
26:45 doesn't understand american humor
26:48 so that was the killing blow
26:52 so in 1886 and this is uh
26:55 definitely supported by a lot of
26:56 different texts at the age of 30.
26:59 he basically called this
27:03 his winter of suffering
27:06 and it lasted essentially from the turn
27:09 of 1886 to 1887 so that winter was the
27:11 worst
27:12 year of his life so now he's out on his
27:15 own
27:16 what's he going to do he needs investors
27:17 if he's going to do his own company
27:19 edison is a two-faced you know
27:22 backstabber
27:25 and so he ends up digging a ditch for
27:27 two dollars a day
27:29 now here's what's fascinating in
27:32 1886 tesla's granted six patents
27:36 okay so this ditch digger is like this a
27:39 crazy amazing guy and he gets
27:42 uh primarily most of his patents are all
27:45 based on the dino electric
27:48 improvements to the dc system so he went
27:50 and took what he did for edison and
27:52 applied for patents
27:53 and got six of them right off the bat a
27:55 lot of them having to do with arc light
27:59 refinements as well so he's working with
28:00 arclight now remind you that
28:03 in the future here when he
28:06 ends up entertaining uh mark twain a
28:09 person that he
28:10 fell in love with as a young man reading
28:12 the books he eventually gets to meet
28:14 mark twain which for him was
28:16 massive mark twain would say that
28:19 because mark twain would go to dinner in
28:21 new york with a bunch of amazing
28:23 you know aristocratic people
28:26 and then bring them all to tesla's lab
28:29 which we'll get to
28:30 in a few years here and tesla would do
28:33 all these amazing
28:34 electricity shows but twain always said
28:37 look we walk in this room
28:39 and he goes there's tons of machines
28:41 none of them have power cables
28:43 but they're all on which you use
28:46 inductance which we'll get into
28:47 a few years from now but he also said
28:49 that the ceiling was lit
28:51 and he couldn't see where the light
28:52 bulbs were
28:54 now the real probably truth of that is
28:57 is that
28:58 because he's an archlight master he was
29:01 able to build
29:02 arc light systems even in tubes with gas
29:05 in them and then hit them with the
29:07 resonance system and inductance and get
29:11 the
29:12 basically a neon sign to glow without a
29:14 wire because he's just hitting it with
29:15 the power
29:16 to stimulate the gas inside the chamber
29:18 that's probably what that was
29:21 so in 1887 he forms the tesla electric
29:24 company
29:24 and that's the big one this one doesn't
29:27 go down
29:28 in flames for a while
29:31 so he sets up a partnership with some
29:34 folks from western union
29:36 and he has a demonstration he calls the
29:40 egg of columbus where he is
29:42 demonstrating his
29:43 ac refinements his buddy anthony
29:48 from europe eventually arrives over here
29:50 in the states
29:51 so in 1887 so you know tesla's about 31
29:55 years old at the time
29:57 and immediately starts working for tesla
29:59 and that year he got another patent
30:01 on the dyno electric machine which
30:05 essentially improved the construction of
30:08 system itself again he's going in
30:11 he's making little meticulous changes to
30:13 things and patenting the little tiny
30:15 pieces and parts
30:16 that make something more efficient both
30:18 from assembly standpoint
30:19 but also its overall design
30:22 so in 1888 he's 32 years old and he
30:26 gives a speech before the
30:27 a-i-e-e tonight it's
30:30 make sure it's the alternating current
30:33 motors and
30:34 transformers is the the speech
30:38 title on that it's now the ieee
30:42 which i've actually been to a function
30:43 and spoke with them
30:45 at the columbia columbia unit columbia
30:47 university in new york
30:49 but this is where he ends up selling one
30:52 of his
30:53 ac polyphase system patents to
30:56 george westinghouse for twenty five
30:58 thousand dollars in cash
31:00 fifty thousand dollars in notes and a
31:01 royalty of two dollars and 2.50
31:03 every time the ac motor is manufactured
31:08 so he goes to pittsburgh and ends up
31:10 spending about a year there
31:12 working with working kind of with the
31:15 westinghouse dude
31:16 as an investor now in 1888
31:21 the same year right he ends up getting
31:23 14 patents filed
31:24 for all of his stuff a lot of
31:28 electromagnetic motor patents
31:31 and he starts cracking the electrical
31:35 transmission of power
31:36 so this is huge this is i mean 1888 man
31:39 i wonder when this stuff
31:41 you know came about but this is this is
31:43 as early as he did it
31:46 and this has to do with you know trans
31:48 translating
31:50 you know airborne electricity back into
31:53 currents inside machines that he could
31:55 you know utilize that wherever the
31:58 machines were in proximity to the power
32:00 generator but he just gets a half a
32:03 dozen
32:04 patents based on the various properties
32:08 of an electric motor
32:09 from thermal dissipation you know heat
32:12 to
32:13 how to regulate the current properly so
32:15 you wouldn't just have runaway machines
32:17 that would pop
32:18 so he's setting a huge foundation for
32:20 his future here
32:22 and what's interesting is you know
32:23 electricity is becoming extremely
32:25 popular in the world
32:27 slowly but surely where it is is super
32:29 popular because it's like magic
32:31 and this dude was smart enough to patent
32:34 all the little systems that make it work
32:35 i mean all the little tiny systems
32:38 brilliant
32:39 if you ever know capacity to take
32:40 advantage of the emerging market
32:43 go for it it may not be sexy but it'll
32:45 be very very lucrative
32:47 and i i assume it'll be very fun for
32:48 anyone who's doing this
32:50 so in 1889 at the age of 33 he opens the
32:53 grand
32:54 saint lab and this is i believe is the
32:57 place where
32:58 he did most those demonstrations and got
33:00 himself in trouble a couple times too
33:03 this is the same year that he
33:07 really started to understand the
33:09 electromagnetic
33:10 radiation influencing light
33:13 which is a really big deal now one thing
33:16 you should know about tesla
33:18 is that despite his humble nature
33:21 which he had the biggest humble circuit
33:24 any human being could possibly have
33:26 one thing that he loved was spending his
33:28 money on posh locations to live
33:31 his whole life ends up turning into in
33:33 his later years which we're going to get
33:35 to here
33:36 he has tons of debts with hotels he
33:38 racks up i mean we're talking about
33:40 late 1800s early 1900s he is racking up
33:43 deaths like three thousand dollars and
33:45 then he just books to another hotel and
33:47 gets another room and then racks up
33:48 another debt and then he'll bump into
33:50 friends of his
33:52 who love him who will then pay off those
33:55 debts to make sure he stays out of
33:56 trouble
33:57 but in the same year he actually takes a
33:59 boat and goes back over to paris
34:02 and um looks at the unveiling of the
34:05 eiffel tower
34:06 which is pretty cool and he ends up
34:08 working underneath
34:09 a professor of physics over there
34:13 a norwegian physicist at the university
34:15 of stockholm
34:16 gosh i hate to say this guy's name wrong
34:18 wilhelm birkness
34:21 and he was working on the oscillator and
34:23 so he let
34:24 um tesla basically apprentice him for a
34:27 really short period of time
34:28 before then making a trip back to his
34:30 homeland and then eventually returning
34:32 to new york the same year
34:35 now in that same year he's granted 12
34:38 new
34:38 patents now the majority of these
34:41 patents are all about
34:43 perfecting the electric motor but the
34:46 other thing that he perfected in this
34:48 year
34:48 was generating a dc current
34:51 from an ac motor huge plus uh one
34:55 that was refining the transmission of
34:57 electricity again
34:59 it was the method of electrical power of
35:01 transmission
35:02 electric power electrical power
35:04 transmission excuse me
35:07 wikipedia has a great page dedicated to
35:10 all these patents if you want to go in
35:12 and see some of them but also read them
35:14 straight out of the patent office which
35:15 is super cool
35:16 they're very easy to understand in my
35:19 opinion if you have a basic
35:21 knowledge of electricity i am again
35:23 trying to keep
35:24 this episode from being insanely
35:27 technical but when we do get into the
35:28 tesla coil that's we'll take a slight
35:30 dive into the technology
35:32 and how these things are created because
35:33 it will all feed into
35:35 this death ray he had a design in his
35:39 head
35:42 so in 1890 at the age of 34
35:46 this is where tesla really discovers
35:50 wireless power i mean it's the de facto
35:52 year where this occurs
35:54 and this is where he does the little
35:56 trick with the neon
35:58 and fluorescent elimination wirelessly
36:01 right he also dabbled in x-ray
36:05 photographs which is pretty cool
36:08 and this is where it's really noted that
36:09 he certainly
36:11 started his obsession with wireless
36:13 transmission or power
36:14 at this point now this is also the year
36:18 just to reiterate 1890 where you have
36:21 the edison tesla wars
36:24 a tesla's minding his own business
36:26 trying to create the ac
36:27 motor and what they figured out was that
36:29 the way that alternating current
36:31 fluctuates
36:33 it's very deadly to human tissue or
36:36 living tissue
36:37 uh unless it's regulated over to a dc
36:40 current or you ground yourself properly
36:41 you don't drive the circuit all the way
36:43 through your body
36:44 to kill you and so edison
36:47 who in our eyes has this blessed
36:50 background we just think he's the
36:52 greatest guy on planet earth
36:54 i think most of you know tesla know this
36:55 story but for those of you who are new
36:57 to the story
36:58 edison was an evil man
37:02 when it came to his empire he ended up
37:06 torturing animals he would capture
37:09 people's dogs and electrocute them to
37:11 death
37:12 and then put them on people's doorstep
37:14 and then put a note on the dog saying
37:16 sorry we found your dog electrocuted
37:19 with an ac motor
37:21 they ended up creating a term because
37:24 westinghouse was funding tesla
37:26 they called it you were westinghoused
37:29 and if you ever
37:30 see a um
37:33 a video there's a video where edison
37:35 actually took an elephant to new york
37:37 city
37:37 and strapped him to a big ac motor and
37:40 fried the elephant there's a video of
37:41 this
37:42 which you can see online and it just
37:44 goes to show you
37:46 the moral lack of code in
37:49 edison so just keep that in your mind
37:52 before you start
37:53 pedaling his uh his accomplishments he
37:56 was a
37:56 he was a bastard just put it quietly
38:00 now this other dude william kimmeler
38:03 just a random guy
38:05 kills his wife with an axe and so he's
38:07 sentenced to die
38:08 and they sentenced him to death in an
38:11 electric chair
38:12 using an ac motor and because they
38:15 didn't know what the hell they were
38:16 doing his death was
38:19 atrocious and it really
38:22 shined a huge light on the westinghouse
38:24 funding of tesla
38:25 and that he was just made into a monster
38:27 and we know how this works today with
38:29 all the narrative control well
38:30 they pumped this one pretty hard
38:34 now what ends up happening in order to
38:36 fight
38:38 the war in addition to all these deaths
38:40 that edison's causing
38:42 killing animals okay people's pets for
38:45 god's sakes right in an innocent
38:46 elephant of course
38:50 um i believe the way this goes is that
38:51 the dc motors had
38:53 continued to improve large part to tesla
38:56 and so the voltage requirements of these
38:58 motors were going up and up and up
39:00 because
39:01 it's being used more and more imagine a
39:03 motor could
39:05 you know light up so many lights in a
39:06 particular street or on a particular
39:08 boat or whatever
39:09 so the voltage requirements were going
39:11 up faster
39:13 than tesla could perfect his ac motor
39:15 system
39:16 when that occurred westinghouse used
39:19 that as leverage against tesla
39:22 to remove the 2.50
39:25 royalty that he got for every one of his
39:27 motors that were being created
39:29 something that ended up you know
39:31 plugging tesla for the rest of his life
39:33 now my interpretation of this is the
39:36 following
39:37 tesla was an ultimate you know chess
39:40 player in his mind
39:42 and so where people say that he was an
39:43 idiot for
39:45 letting go of that 2.50 royalty which
39:47 would have made him
39:48 trillions of dollars by now right
39:50 whatever
39:52 heir he could have possibly had which he
39:53 had no children no wife
39:56 but had he gone there he would have made
39:59 a ton of money but now
40:00 he is focused on what at this particular
40:04 year 1890 he's obsessed with wireless
40:06 transmission of electricity
40:08 so tesla's looking at all these motors
40:10 going who cares about all this
40:12 antiquated crap
40:13 definitely dc is going to be out soon
40:15 because his ac motor will improve he's
40:16 100
40:17 faith in himself he's filing tons of
40:20 patents
40:21 proving that this is all going in the
40:23 right direction the patent office is you
40:24 know backing him up by
40:26 granting the patents remember you can't
40:27 get a patent unless you can prove it
40:29 okay so for some of you look up those uh
40:32 patents to things like
40:34 what's the 1996 patent that cures aids
40:38 you know look it up we don't get that
40:40 patent unless you can prove it
40:41 so somebody proved it and there you go
40:44 so he ends up closing the lab
40:48 at grand street and
40:51 they don't have any documented reason
40:52 why he did it he moved to west broadway
40:55 and the speculation is that uh
40:58 uh it was a bigger facility maybe even
41:00 closer to where he was living at the
41:01 particular time
41:03 but it was uh destroyed by a fire in
41:05 1895 which he talks about in his
41:07 autobiography as being
41:09 you know horrific now
41:12 it's being reported as just a regular
41:14 old fire now it was back in the days
41:16 before we had a bunch of
41:17 fire safety and a bunch of other stuff
41:19 and of course he's playing with
41:20 electricity so maybe
41:22 something he was making did it however
41:25 he's also a wanted man technically by
41:29 edison
41:30 if he escapes edison's plan but he still
41:33 exists edison
41:34 sees him as a threat so i'm going to put
41:37 money down that there's at least a 50 50
41:39 chance that
41:40 it was accidented out of existence
41:45 in the same year he's granted six more
41:47 patents
41:48 again the guy's killing it right now
41:52 one of the patents of this particular
41:54 year is for electric
41:56 electrical transformer or induction
41:59 device
42:01 now again this is 1890 okay
42:05 he's only 34 years old and he just
42:08 patented the thing that allows you to
42:10 charge your phone
42:12 without a cable i have two in my house i
42:15 no longer plug my phone in i just put in
42:17 this little
42:18 docking bay and it charges the phone
42:20 it's a beautiful thing
42:22 1890 people then amazing this dude was
42:26 so ahead of his time
42:28 and as i describe this to you most of
42:30 you know but if you're totally new and
42:32 this is just something you're watching
42:34 you're not taught who nikola tesla is in
42:35 school
42:37 maybe if you go all the way into
42:39 electrical engineering
42:40 you start to hear about tesla but they
42:42 don't want you to know about this
42:44 guy because what he opened up was the
42:46 pandora's box
42:47 to get rid of all electrical companies
42:49 in the world the way that they exist
42:51 today
42:51 gets rid of all wires in the world
42:54 you can have every device in the world
42:57 in your house fully powered
42:59 electricity will travel through your
43:00 body causing no harm
43:02 and as soon as it hits the circuit it
43:06 induces into a circuit current
43:11 now one thing i want to say here because
43:12 in his autobiography
43:15 he talks about this when he gets off the
43:17 boat and sees new york for the first
43:19 time
43:20 he was sort of appalled by new york he's
43:23 just thought it was a backwards barbaric
43:26 world
43:27 and his first notes to
43:30 those around him and his family back
43:32 home was he thought that america was
43:33 like a hundred years behind
43:35 europe and then that over time
43:40 very quickly in a couple years he said
43:42 nah
43:43 actually what i realized was america was
43:45 100 years ahead of europe
43:47 which i think is very very interesting
43:49 and it was essentially that america was
43:51 just a world of opportunity whereas
43:54 europe
43:55 like i keep saying in other episodes was
43:57 a tyrannical monarchy ridden place
44:00 even though they had because america got
44:02 free europe was trying
44:04 the citizens basically saw freedom and
44:05 said we want some of that and so it kind
44:06 of diminished and
44:08 the leaders hid and made it made them
44:10 feel like they were free
44:12 so in 1891 at the age of 35 he gains his
44:15 american citizenship
44:17 and he actually said that throughout his
44:20 life he said he thought his american
44:22 citizenship was more valuable than all
44:24 the patents that he'd ever come up with
44:26 which is very very interesting and
44:27 endearing
44:30 now in this particular year you also
44:32 have
44:33 tesla inventing the first version of his
44:36 tesla coil
44:37 so i'm going to say the year again when
44:39 things like that happen so you kind of
44:40 put this in your brain if you're one of
44:41 those kind of people so 1891
44:44 he comes up with the first prototype of
44:46 his testicle
44:48 which initially was used for lighting
44:50 things and various other utilities but
44:52 it was such a generic device
44:54 and held within it so many different uh
44:57 possibilities that it's going to become
44:59 a giant part of his um his wardencliff
45:03 tower which unfortunately i have been
45:06 quoting the years incorrect in previous
45:08 episodes i do apologize
45:09 we're not quite there yet but uh i had
45:12 this is what's wrong with my my memory i
45:14 remember numbers too quickly
45:16 and too permanently in my brain so i had
45:18 heard
45:19 someone quote 1917-1927
45:23 totally incorrect it's 1906-1917
45:26 that's when the tower gets torn down so
45:29 i apologize for misleading anyone's
45:31 brain
45:33 this is also the year the tesla had
45:36 given lectures and
45:37 papers and he had talked about
45:41 this fundamental charged particle that
45:44 ends up becoming the electron right it's
45:46 the
45:47 duality of the dielectric wave hitting a
45:48 magnetic wave becoming electromagnetic
45:52 now jj thompson is the guy that's
45:54 accredited with
45:57 discovering the electron but he didn't
45:59 publish his findings until
46:00 five years after tesla had already
46:03 lamented about the particles potential
46:05 existence
46:06 here's the difference one guy gives it a
46:08 name one guy talks about it existing
46:11 the guy who talks about existing tesla
46:13 the guy who ends up giving it the name
46:15 is five years later
46:16 and of course he gets the credit for it
46:18 that's just how it works so make sure
46:19 you give your stuff names
46:21 that way uh you know you don't get
46:25 you don't get ripped off tesla also
46:28 is commissioned to to install the
46:31 largest
46:33 ac motor of the time at the gold king
46:35 mine
46:36 which has a couple attributes one it's a
46:38 tremendous amount of power
46:40 it was known as the ames power plant and
46:43 it was also known for transmitting power
46:45 the longest distance on a wire
46:47 which i'm not going to go into the total
46:50 details if you want the
46:52 amazing details of transmitting
46:53 electricity and clear signals
46:56 over a wire a
46:59 slight deep dive if not a good two hour
47:01 documentary on the telegraph
47:04 lines which happened before this it's
47:06 huge
47:07 when you want to string wire for a
47:09 really really long time and turn corners
47:11 you start losing power at every junction
47:13 so the way the wires were
47:15 insulated the way the power was
47:16 transmitted it's a
47:18 monumental accomplishment before tesla's
47:22 time
47:24 now that particular year 1891 he's
47:26 granted 11
47:27 patents okay
47:31 so i'm going through these patents um i
47:33 will tell you that
47:34 most of the patents in this early era
47:37 are usually under the
47:38 auspices of an electromagnetic motor
47:42 so what he is doing with dozens and
47:45 dozens of electromagnetic motor patents
47:47 is he is perfecting the tiniest little
47:50 part
47:51 inside these electric motors to make the
47:53 brushes more
47:55 efficient to take away brush motors
47:57 altogether
47:58 little tiny parts little regulators
48:01 little sensors so he can
48:02 control the circuit better he's
48:04 basically engineering
48:06 tons of little components based on his
48:08 predecessors
48:10 to make it possible for us to create
48:12 electronics
48:14 in the uh 20th century
48:18 so in 1892 he's 36 years old
48:21 and at this point i think he realized
48:23 that in order to
48:26 get funding and get support for his
48:28 inventions he's going to have to start
48:29 kind of spreading the word about what
48:31 he's doing
48:32 so you know we talked about the real
48:34 gymnasium
48:35 lecturing and teaching where he
48:37 basically said i don't want to do this
48:38 for a living i want to be an inventor
48:41 he starts a series of lectures
48:44 essentially wherever he can he does
48:46 lectures in great britain
48:47 he does lectures in paris again
48:51 but while in paris his lecture circuit
48:55 gets cut short because he gets a note
48:56 from his uncle
48:58 peter or pitar that
49:01 his mother's dying and so he rushes home
49:03 to his uh
49:04 mother's side and what's beautiful about
49:08 is this mother said uh
49:09 you know one of the quotes was uh her
49:12 last words to him were
49:15 you've arrived nicola my pride
49:18 so pretty cool you know i think he knows
49:21 that his father was very proud of him i
49:23 think
49:23 his father was just not equipped as an
49:25 orthodox priest to handle a genius son
49:28 and so genius can look really strange
49:30 when you're young especially
49:31 like he said he he said that
49:35 in a lot occasions um people would think
49:37 he was one of the laziest guys on planet
49:39 earth because he would sit and think and
49:40 invent in that other reality that he had
49:42 access to and people would translate
49:44 that incorrectly
49:45 as him goofing off or just yeah just
49:49 goofing off in general
49:50 so after his mother dies it hits him
49:52 pretty hard and he gets ill
49:55 and he spends two or three weeks over
49:56 there recovering
49:58 and then he ends up visiting people in
50:01 croatia the capital of
50:05 zagreb i think that's the way you say it
50:08 and he realizes okay so
50:12 he comes from this place he loves it you
50:14 know you hear me talk all about my
50:16 hometown and i have that love for my
50:17 hometown
50:18 and you always want to help your
50:19 hometown so he had that feeling and so
50:21 he starts lecturing about
50:22 his inventions in the united states and
50:24 he's trying to pass on as much
50:26 information as possible
50:27 to help them potentially create
50:28 hydroelectric
50:31 facilities anything he can do to
50:35 help out his home country in that
50:37 particular year he was only awarded
50:39 one patent for the system of electrical
50:41 transmission of power
50:43 huge right so you can see him just
50:46 gaining steam on what he was doing it
50:48 was very slow and very methodical took a
50:50 tremendous amount of work
50:52 this isn't an overnight you know alien
50:54 invasion of his mind sort of thing he
50:56 really worked hard for it which
50:57 is pretty much the case for most human
51:00 beings in the world
51:01 we just like to gloss over hard work and
51:04 just think that people have epiphanies
51:06 which is why a lot of people don't
51:08 succeed because they're looking for that
51:10 instant turnaround right
51:13 so it's 1893 he's 37 years old
51:16 he starts giving lectures at
51:18 philadelphia and st louis
51:20 again he's building a rapport with what
51:22 he's doing
51:23 so people go oh yeah we want this over
51:25 that
51:26 brilliant move on his part so in the
51:29 same year
51:30 actually sorry in the previous year
51:32 while tesla wasn't there
51:34 westinghouse wins this power contract
51:39 called the colombian exposition
51:44 and he ends up building a giant power
51:47 station
51:48 for chicago and just blows the doors off
51:51 um anyone's expectations using his egg
51:54 of columbus which i believe is the bulb
51:56 that
51:57 illuminates so he used wireless
51:59 transmission of power to light
52:00 fluorescent light bulbs all over
52:03 the city of chicago pretty cool right
52:05 now what westinghouse is trying to do
52:07 is demonstrate that his company with his
52:09 ac technology through tesla
52:11 is fully production ready and he's going
52:14 for the niagara falls
52:16 hydroelectric system that they know that
52:18 he knows but everyone knows that they're
52:20 building but no one's chosen the company
52:21 yet
52:23 so tesla travels to belgrade
52:26 it's a huge honor from the president
52:29 of belgrade and he moves out of his
52:33 astor house
52:34 and moves over to the hotel gerlach
52:38 and he loved it because the
52:41 the new hotel was all powered by
52:42 electric lights so he was like i want to
52:44 be surrounded by my own stuff
52:46 plus the hotel was fireproof
52:49 so that was a big thing for him uh
52:51 apparently
52:52 you know he had been elected the vice
52:54 president of the aiee
52:56 which is now ieee and
52:59 he got reelected that year as the vice
53:01 president
53:03 and by the end of the year westinghouse
53:05 is awarded
53:06 the niagara falls contract tesla wins
53:08 two patents that year for the electrical
53:10 transmission of power
53:12 and the system of electrical power
53:14 transmission
53:15 awesome right he's starting to really
53:18 gain steam
53:19 by him getting the patents it's proving
53:22 to us that it works but it's also
53:24 legitimizing him to the world plus every
53:27 time you go for a cell every time you go
53:28 for a pitch of a product
53:30 the people are skeptical about because
53:32 you got the edison company breathing
53:33 down your back
53:34 bring in this huge list of patents to
53:37 say look this is the
53:38 this is where it's at it closes the deal
53:42 they also consider the green lighting of
53:44 the niagara falls
53:46 hydroelectric system using ac current
53:48 motors
53:49 as the end of the current wars meaning
53:52 tesla in
53:52 edison out so in 1894 he's 38 years old
53:57 and he's voted the corresponding member
53:59 of the serbian royal academy of belgrade
54:02 so he's getting accolades men he's
54:04 really getting recognized around the
54:06 world
54:07 and again you know you can give away
54:09 those kind of awards to people but it's
54:11 always because you have an
54:12 accomplishment behind you today it's
54:14 just because you're famous on a
54:15 television show
54:17 but there was a guy thomas martin who
54:19 publishes a book called electrical world
54:22 and it was all about the research of
54:24 nikola tesla
54:26 and i was an editor of the electrical
54:28 world excuse me
54:30 and he was also a vice president of the
54:33 aiee
54:34 but he publishes a book called the
54:35 inventions research researches
54:38 and writings of nikola tesla i want to
54:40 say that to you so you want to in case
54:42 you want to look it up
54:43 it's um it's drier writing from back in
54:46 the day
54:48 that particular year he is awarded 11
54:50 more patents
54:53 now this particular year of patents is
54:55 actually fairly interesting because he's
54:57 given a
54:58 patent on the coil of electro magnets
55:03 which we'll get into electro conductor
55:05 electrical conductor
55:09 electrical railway system incandescent
55:11 electric light system
55:13 electrical meter even does
55:16 perfections to a steam engine and more
55:19 electromagnetic motors
55:22 now we're going to talk at this stage
55:25 about
55:27 the coil because the coil is a giant
55:29 principle of the tesla coil
55:33 and i've talked about coil several times
55:36 on the show but
55:37 i found it through this book by mark
55:39 bean who
55:40 sadly left us early in his life at 2013.
55:45 uh mark bean was
55:48 a tesla enthusiast probably understood
55:51 tesla
55:52 as much as any master tesla historian
55:57 electrical engineer than anybody i know
55:59 i've got his book
56:00 which was given to my my friend carla
56:04 because i now have two testicles in my
56:06 house to
56:07 two 250 000 volt tesla coils
56:12 but in mark bean's book he puts together
56:14 an analogy of coils that i have never
56:15 heard before
56:16 which is absolutely and utterly
56:18 brilliant
56:19 now when i studied coils as a young man
56:23 the general principle was that every
56:25 time you take a wire and you put a
56:27 electrical current on it and then you
56:30 circle that wire
56:31 around so that it touches the previous
56:35 conductive coil so you've seen these 100
56:36 times where you have
56:38 you know back of a tv back in the old
56:40 crt days
56:41 you pull the cover off of tv and you
56:43 have this massive
56:44 wad of copper wire on the back of the tv
56:47 tube and if anybody was smart in the
56:49 room they said you touch that you die so
56:50 just don't touch it okay
56:52 let's discharge it off to a ground and
56:54 then we do a voltage meter on it and
56:56 it's empty
56:56 then you can touch it do repairs
57:00 but that's way after the tesla coil
57:03 what ends up happening is if you put
57:05 half an amp of
57:07 current and current is best
57:10 understood as the pressure that goes
57:14 into a cable
57:15 amperage is the flow so imagine
57:19 you are i'm trying to think of a good
57:21 analogy here
57:23 let's say you had some dye like those
57:25 little dye things you use the easter
57:27 right all the different colors to color
57:28 easter eggs
57:29 and you had different fabrics that
57:32 you're going to
57:33 squeeze that onto you know it's going to
57:35 bleed into the fabric and let's say we
57:36 use red
57:37 just to make it easy for your brain and
57:39 it's all white fabrics
57:41 so you know that if you have like a
57:44 cotton
57:45 paper towel it doesn't take that much
57:47 pressure to get that red
57:49 dye to go into the paper towel and
57:51 really spread all over it so
57:53 it would be called if that was an
57:54 electrical conductive material
57:57 you'd say it has a high level of
57:58 conductivity very little pressure
58:00 will move the dye quicker through the
58:03 medium that you're putting it on
58:05 but now let's just say you've got some
58:06 really dense wool
58:08 and now you take the same little squeeze
58:09 bottle and you squeeze it on there
58:11 and it's not it's bleeding into the wool
58:14 but it's not going as far as it did in
58:15 the paper towel
58:16 an electrical analogy the wool is less
58:19 conductive
58:20 and this is not an electrical statement
58:23 but if you have a less conductive
58:24 material a metal that's not as
58:26 conductive as this other stuff
58:28 you will need more current to push it
58:31 into the stuff that's not as conductive
58:35 one of the reasons why we can touch nine
58:37 volt
58:38 batteries to our tongues and get that
58:40 that stingy sensation on your tongue
58:42 but you don't die is because your body
58:45 is more like the wool it's less
58:47 conductive to
58:49 9 volts of energy however if you opened
58:52 up your chest
58:54 and just stuck the battery on your heart
58:56 you could die
58:57 because it doesn't have that far to
58:59 travel and it's going to hit that
59:01 heart and completely confusing to the
59:03 point you probably die
59:05 so when a coil is doing its thing it
59:08 is using what's called resonance
59:11 and resonance is best
59:15 analogized by those old videos i've
59:18 mentioned this several times for a bunch
59:20 of different reasons and different
59:21 videos but
59:22 many of you have seen those videos of
59:24 the old bridges they built
59:26 back in the 30s where the bridge is
59:29 shaking like it's made out of taffy it's
59:32 got a car on there and everything it's a
59:34 big bridge
59:35 and it eventually shakes so much that it
59:37 blows up
59:39 and most of us understand why the bridge
59:42 is doing this they said
59:44 the bridge was built at an accidental
59:46 frequency
59:47 which could be also augmented by the
59:50 wind going over the bridge
59:52 so we think in our brains without having
59:54 a lot of electrical knowledge
59:56 okay well the bridge is vibrating at a
59:59 natural frequency
60:00 of its structure and the wind happens to
60:02 be vibrating at the same
60:04 level of frequency the reason why the
60:06 bridge
60:07 starts building up the wave and building
60:09 up the wave to the points crazy and
60:11 eventually breaks and falls into the
60:12 river down below
60:14 is because of resonance because the two
60:16 frequencies
60:17 are in i think opposite polarity is what
60:20 you could say it
60:21 but it's basically pushing like a swing
60:23 you push your friend with the swing
60:25 you're just hitting them once in the
60:26 butt when they come up to you and blow
60:28 all the energy discharges and you have
60:29 the energy in the swing
60:31 so a coil in a tesla coil is running
60:35 a primary circuit of electricity and a
60:38 secondary circuit
60:39 and what ends up happening is this
60:41 residence
60:43 flow starts to occur and that's what
60:45 happens in a coil
60:46 and that it starts to augment the
60:48 voltage
60:49 the pressure which will then
60:52 obviously successfully increase your
60:54 amperage usually but you usually
60:56 regulate your amperage so you don't have
60:57 a runaway circuit
60:58 because then the whole thing would blow
61:00 up and thermalize in front of your face
61:01 right
61:03 so 1895 he's 39 years old
61:07 and his laboratory in broadway
61:11 west broadway which was known as south
61:14 5th
61:14 avenue at the time burns down
61:18 50 000 of
61:22 inventions plans notes laboratory data
61:24 tools photographs
61:26 or destroy now again what are the odds
61:29 that all this guy's
61:31 laboratories are burning down someone's
61:33 after the dude
61:34 someone doesn't want him to succeed
61:37 ironically
61:38 um he was put up in the llewellyn park
61:41 new jersey
61:42 in one of the edison laboratories this
61:44 is a temporary fix until he relocated
61:48 in greenwich village now at the time
61:52 he also um finished up the first niagara
61:55 falls power plant
61:58 that bore tesla's name and it
62:01 ran at 250 revolutions per minute and it
62:04 was deemed
62:04 absolute success
62:07 that thomas martin guy who was initially
62:11 well eventually credited with
62:12 discovering the electron publishes a
62:14 paper called tesla's oscillators and
62:16 other inventions
62:17 in century magazine an article in there
62:20 so hopefully that meant that they were
62:22 sort of getting along
62:25 so 1896 with the
62:28 test runs of the niagara falls patent
62:31 oh sorry with niagara falls power plant
62:33 he's 40 years old now
62:36 they turn on the atoms power plant at
62:38 niagara falls which produces a thousand
62:40 horsepower
62:41 and it transmitted electricity to
62:44 buffalo new york 22 miles away
62:46 so absolute raving success
62:49 and they ended up having a huge
62:51 celebration with a bunch of cannons and
62:52 all kinds of wild stuff which was cool
62:56 and then tesla is elected honorary
62:58 member of the yugoslavian academy of
63:00 sciences
63:00 and arts in zagreb
63:03 that year is granted seven more patents
63:08 so this is where the patents
63:11 focus a lot on generating high frequency
63:14 currents
63:16 which is very useful for creating
63:20 uh various apparatus so
63:23 this suite of patents has an apparatus
63:26 for producing electrical currents of
63:28 high frequency
63:29 and an apparatus of producing ozone
63:32 because
63:32 when electrical discharges happen ozone
63:36 is created
63:37 and so for instance if you have a tesla
63:39 coil
63:40 firing in a particular area which i'm
63:43 going to eventually shoot
63:45 the tesla coils um doing the thing in
63:48 the backyard here
63:51 it's producing ozone and so they really
63:53 want you to be
63:54 in a well-ventilated area so you don't
63:56 get toxified by the gases
64:00 1897 in the age of 41
64:03 he's again focused on
64:06 his lecture circuit in new york
64:10 he's granted four more patents
64:13 he works on transformers then he
64:16 continues to patent
64:17 refinements for his apparatus for
64:19 currents of high frequency
64:22 again this is going to the next level
64:25 high frequency
64:26 is going to mean a lot of inventions are
64:29 possible that were possible before
64:32 so in 1898 at the age of 42 he's
64:35 continuing his lectures
64:36 buffalo new york and he ends up creating
64:41 a demonstration of what he calls
64:43 automation
64:44 or automaton excuse me and what he does
64:47 is he creates
64:48 a little uh boat where he puts it in the
64:52 water outside of madison square gardens
64:54 and then controls it with the wireless
64:55 remote
64:57 this is 1898 folks when i got my first
65:01 remote control car in 1977
65:04 a little uh trans am that matched smokey
65:08 in the bandit i was completely ecstatic
65:10 and little did i know about 80 years
65:12 before this had been done
65:14 by nikola tesla that same year he has
65:18 granted
65:18 10 more patents one of the heaviest
65:21 focuses of this particular
65:23 set of patents was the control of
65:25 electrical current
65:27 again once you start moving more
65:30 electricity you need to put more
65:31 precautions in
65:32 to make sure that you know you're safe
65:35 and so you put in
65:36 and you got literally half a dozen
65:39 patents on electrical current
65:40 controllers
65:42 but it also patents something related to
65:45 that little boat in the water
65:47 method of an method of an apparatus of
65:50 controlling mechanisms of moving
65:52 vehicles or
65:53 vehicle awesome right
65:57 so 1899 at the age of 43
66:02 tesla heads to colorado springs he does
66:05 a lecture in
66:06 chicago on the way out there but this is
66:08 where he builds
66:10 the largest tesla coil i believe in
66:12 history
66:14 had he finished his wall warden cliff
66:17 tower that would have been the new one
66:20 but it ends up
66:21 uh first he creates a small one and it
66:23 just created like
66:25 electric static off the top is about
66:27 five inches was very thick and messy and
66:29 noisy
66:30 and when you read mark bean's book on
66:33 tesla coils what you'll end up
66:34 understanding
66:35 is it's a very simple device but it has
66:38 massive implications and uses
66:42 it's all built on a formula that tesla
66:45 created
66:46 where and mark bean's books fantastic
66:49 because
66:50 mark bean what he does is he says if you
66:52 can only get a hold of this type of
66:54 transformer then you need
66:55 these other types of pieces to work with
66:57 that amount of power
66:58 if you only find these types of coils
67:00 then you have to get a transformer that
67:02 works with that particular coil
67:03 so he teaches the teaches you the
67:05 algorithms of whatever you can get a
67:06 hold of
67:08 that will determine what you can build
67:10 your testicle out of but everything has
67:12 to marry each other you can't have a
67:14 tiny
67:14 resistor with a giant transformer you're
67:16 gonna have to do a bunch of um
67:18 balancing in the equipment but what's
67:20 cool about it is within his book within
67:22 the first chapter
67:24 you're going to notice i don't know if
67:25 it's chapter but first 25 pages you're
67:28 going to learn the formula for
67:30 when you turn on the tesla coil based on
67:32 how you've built it
67:33 how much power you're putting in and how
67:35 it's going to metabolize power
67:37 you can calculate to the inch how far
67:41 the little static electricity is going
67:42 to come off the top of the coil or any
67:44 device you attach to it to spit the
67:45 sparks out
67:46 which is super duper cool so you can
67:48 actually build these things extremely
67:50 safe
67:51 if you know exactly what you're doing
67:53 now
67:54 in mark bean's book he warned you
67:56 against killing yourself uh for probably
67:58 the first two pages and it's not a joke
68:00 it's not a joke so um
68:03 if you're gonna dabble in that be
68:05 extremely careful
68:07 but there's a guy named john jacob astor
68:10 who owned a hotel
68:11 investigation on a bunch of stuff but he
68:14 ends up giving
68:15 tesla 100 000 to build this thing so
68:18 this particular year he's building stuff
68:20 this is also the same year that he
68:22 noticed
68:24 sort of what he thought to be very
68:26 intelligent messages from space
68:28 very rhythmatic messages that wouldn't
68:30 be created by pure chaos
68:33 now the solution
68:36 to his aliens communicating with the
68:40 world
68:41 is that astronomers basically said
68:44 eventually it was a pulsar
68:46 now pulsar you know i mean they
68:50 say they see them in space and what have
68:51 you now
68:53 the one thing that backs up that it is
68:55 something
68:57 non-intelligent is that you don't have
69:00 like a message coming over the wire as
69:01 far as i know this is a pulse
69:03 that was happening in a particular
69:05 rhythmic matter and not like morris code
69:07 we'd be able to tell if there was a
69:09 language embedded in the protocol
69:10 right so that's going to get deprecated
69:14 a little bit later
69:17 in that same year he really discovered
69:20 the anomaly
69:21 with a what he called the geoelectric
69:24 phenomenon and this is literally the
69:28 basis of what we know as the harp
69:29 antenna system
69:30 the harp antenna system is using a ton
69:32 of his stuff
69:34 you will find out later in this episode
69:37 that it was probably based on a lot of
69:39 the
69:41 rumored and i say rumored and that it
69:45 came out of his mouth
69:46 it wasn't a rumor that was someone else
69:48 was putting it on top of him but as he
69:49 described his death ray
69:51 using the host of patents that he has
69:53 created up to the point he starts
69:54 talking about which we're not there yet
69:56 you'll notice i believe the guy's name
69:58 is bernard easton
70:00 or eastman i think it was 1956 or 57 he
70:03 patents everything for the
70:05 navy to create the harp system and that
70:08 was
70:10 admittedly based on a bunch of tesla
70:12 patents
70:14 this is when he realized that with this
70:16 anomaly
70:17 he could transmit uh
70:20 a terrestrial stationary wave as he
70:24 calls it
70:24 around the world and we know that
70:27 eventually radios
70:28 definitely did exactly that
70:32 so in 1900 he's 44 years old
70:37 and he's asked to submit his wireless
70:41 telegraphy system by a gentleman named
70:44 admiral
70:44 bradford
70:48 and this is where he talks about the
70:50 fact
70:51 that in one of his first
70:53 autobiographical
70:55 writings called my inventions
70:59 he talks about the fact that with his
71:03 testicle he was able to achieve
71:04 a hundred foot wave of you know
71:08 sparks and that particular experiment is
71:10 the one that you have the amazing
71:12 photograph where he's in that
71:13 rounded room with the testicle on the
71:15 center
71:16 and he's sitting in a chair reading a
71:18 book and he's surrounded by electricity
71:21 and the way that it talks the way it's
71:24 discussed was that electricity
71:28 lasted for 60 seconds until they broke
71:29 the circuit
71:32 now there's a tremendous amount of
71:33 stories around that particular
71:36 tesla coil in colorado springs i
71:39 couldn't find this
71:40 in the literature it's been stated
71:42 several times on the web
71:44 so gosh you know what can you do but
71:46 that he said that when he was surrounded
71:48 by this amazing discharge
71:51 in that tesla coil that he saw time
71:53 distort
71:54 that when his assistant was going for
71:56 the circuit to break it so it would stop
71:58 because it was going for 60 full seconds
72:00 and just imagine a lightning bolt in
72:01 your backyard for 60 seconds what that
72:03 must sound like
72:04 especially in a hard room right
72:07 he just said that time had slowed down
72:09 where you this is where you get a lot of
72:10 the uh
72:11 the rumors about you know time travel
72:13 and that kind of stuff that he had it
72:14 all figured out
72:15 and that uh when someone when the
72:17 government came and took his stuff which
72:18 we'll get to
72:19 at the end of this episode that he um
72:23 you know was just the grandfather of
72:25 time travel
72:26 and so i think a lot of that's just
72:28 wishful thinking
72:32 but but tesla has issued a patent
72:35 and 1896 this is four years before the
72:38 year that we're in
72:39 for generating um the ozone
72:43 and so he he founds this tesla ozone
72:46 company
72:47 and what they ended up doing was
72:49 creating a
72:51 you know various medical ointments
72:54 by bubbling ozone through oils
72:57 and then selling the oil so all kinds of
73:00 different oils all kinds of different
73:02 eucalyptus
73:03 pine spearmint oils all kinds of
73:05 different stuff so you would
73:08 bubble this through and then you would
73:10 you're not buying the ozone you're
73:12 buying the after effects of the ozone in
73:14 the
73:15 in the sauce as it were the oil
73:20 that year he's granted four more patents
73:24 a lot of it having to do with the
73:26 transmission of electrical energy
73:28 but one that's a means of increasing the
73:31 intensity of electrical oscillations
73:35 so again all you need to do is
73:37 understand that he is perfecting the
73:39 control mechanisms as electricity starts
73:41 moving he starts building
73:43 machines to gain more control over
73:46 the electricity so he can mold it and do
73:49 whatever he wants with it right
73:52 so in 1901 at the age of 45 tesla signs
73:55 over
73:56 51 of his company in exchange for 150
74:00 000 and just think about what 150 000
74:04 would do for you today this is about
74:08 today to be multiplied times 10. and the
74:11 reason why i know that is that
74:12 i did the calculations of the prize
74:15 money from what's my line in 1955
74:18 roughly of 50 bucks and today it's
74:21 almost a multiply a multiple of
74:24 10. so i guess it might be a 20 factor
74:27 of 20 so just a tremendous amount of
74:29 money
74:30 he also starts well marconi the inventor
74:34 the quote-unquote inventor of the radio
74:36 transmits morse code
74:38 the letter s across the atlantic ocean
74:40 the 200 000 or 2000 mile
74:43 uh transmission which is just super
74:46 amazing right from england to canada
74:49 now later people said uh
74:52 you know tesla was kind of like why
74:54 didn't broadcast anything over the
74:55 atlantic but in terms of wireless
74:57 transmission
74:58 it's my game i was the first person what
75:00 tesla didn't do
75:02 was put an information protocol over the
75:05 transmission
75:06 morris code which was already in
75:07 existence and tesla was
75:10 a telegrapher at some point in his life
75:14 but this is where he breaks ground again
75:17 i just
75:17 have to revise that here one more time
75:19 because a different book of mine said
75:20 1906 so he starts building his
75:23 wardenclyffe tower
75:27 for worldwide wireless transmission of
75:30 power
75:31 it's going to be amazing right
75:34 that same year he's granted six more
75:36 patents
75:39 tesla was asked whether or not he was
75:42 the true inventor of wireless technology
75:45 now tesla did have sort of i would say
75:50 kind of the earliest the tiniest part of
75:55 i guess ego and it wasn't really ego and
75:57 that it was something he was confident
75:59 that he wasn't good at
76:00 he had definitely the desire to get
76:03 credit for what he created
76:05 and so what he his answer to the press i
76:07 believe was
76:08 something to the effect of you know the
76:11 number i'm probably gonna get wrong but
76:12 he says well that's you know it's great
76:14 what mark connie's doing i hope he
76:15 continues he's using
76:17 12 of my patents you know so
76:21 marconi was definitely an inventor of
76:23 information transmission which
76:25 was he should definitely be credited for
76:29 now the six patents that he's given in
76:32 this particular year
76:33 really focus on his i'll just read one
76:36 of them so an apparatus for
76:37 utilizing effects transmitted through
76:39 natural media
76:41 which is what he discovered when he got
76:43 to
76:44 colorado springs so he's trying to make
76:46 sure that the foundation of his tower
76:49 is patented before he goes and builds it
76:51 and so someone else can rip him off
76:52 right
76:53 which it seems to always happen
76:57 now in 1903 at the age of 47
77:00 this is where the um the new york sun
77:04 reported that there was an incident at
77:06 uh
77:07 tesla's laboratory and
77:10 uh the i've read in his book another
77:14 well sorry another book that someone
77:15 else wrote about him that
77:17 what ended up happening was that
77:20 he had wrapped some poles in a tesla
77:23 coil
77:24 and in the coil itself to hold him in
77:26 place and when he created this
77:28 massive level of resonance what ended up
77:30 occurring was the pole started
77:32 resonating with the coil to the point
77:35 where he was shaking the building and he
77:36 had to essentially break the circuit
77:38 otherwise the building was going to
77:39 implode
77:40 based on his uh naughtiness with
77:42 electricity essay mirrors granted two
77:45 patents
77:45 a method of signaling and system of
77:48 signaling
77:50 so a theory and then a system which is
77:52 really cool
77:55 so by 1904 he's still in colorado
77:57 springs
77:59 he um he gets sued for using power
78:03 from a nearby company and he had 180
78:06 judgment which i mean he just borrowed
78:09 150 000
78:10 well he sold half of his he sold a bunch
78:13 of stuff for a hundred grand or astra
78:14 gave him a hundred grand then he
78:16 sells 51 percent of his company for
78:17 another 150 grand
78:19 of course he's staying at these posh
78:20 hotels and paying his bills at the time
78:24 but uh they eventually tore down his
78:25 whole place
78:27 and put it into storage in 1905 at the
78:31 age 49 the major thing that happens he
78:33 gets another patent
78:34 for art of transmitting electrical
78:36 energy through the natural mediums
78:38 same refinement table as the previous
78:41 set of patterns
78:44 so in 1906 he's 50 years old
78:47 and a buddy of his white was
78:51 killed because he was in a little love
78:53 triangle
78:55 leaving the wardencliffe tower without
78:58 financing same exact year tesla
79:02 announces he's got a bladeless turbine
79:04 that he can
79:04 basically sell the world and he said it
79:07 was based on
79:08 adhesion and viscosity two principles of
79:11 all fluids so he's trying to do
79:14 something to raise money he's trying to
79:15 like hey i got a new thing you want to
79:17 get some of this right and so he goes to
79:18 jp morgan to try and get
79:20 funding for his uh word and clip project
79:22 he's unsuccessful
79:24 so he's unable to pay his employees he's
79:26 forced to lay everybody off
79:27 and the construction on the tower ceases
79:30 now i saw a documentary of some guys
79:32 that went out to the wharton cliff
79:34 tower where it was on planet earth and
79:36 it was a
79:37 massive undertaking now
79:41 we've got a a listener that that
79:44 posted that uh tesla was a fraud and
79:46 that his tesla coil this tesla tower
79:49 only worked because of water down below
79:51 had nothing to do with their
79:52 core anything like that okay
79:55 so to reiterate the tower is built on
79:58 top
79:59 of an aqua ravine which is a natural
80:01 rock formation where water comes up from
80:02 the bottom of the earth
80:04 that's forced up from the water table i
80:05 should say and in that water
80:07 carries a tremendous amount of
80:08 electricity same thing the pyramids in
80:11 egypt were built on top of
80:12 then there's a plateau or a foundation
80:15 where you build your object on top of
80:17 and the egyptians are brilliant they
80:18 fill their plateau with the catacomb of
80:21 water waves
80:22 to preserve the power coming up from
80:25 the bottom of the earth now the tower
80:30 has a big ball on the top and it writes
80:33 runs the power down
80:34 now based on what he discovered in
80:35 colorado springs as i've had explained
80:37 to me several times
80:38 he's putting a minute amount of
80:40 electricity into the earth and siphoning
80:42 out of the earth
80:43 as much power as you need that's why the
80:45 tesla tower
80:46 the wall the warden cliff tower was so
80:48 amazing in its theory
80:50 he built it exactly the way the pyramids
80:52 were built i never
80:54 have read a single word the tesla ever
80:57 mentioned the pyramids whatsoever it's
80:59 like nobody knew this
81:00 but he had essentially figured it out
81:02 without
81:03 knowing anything about the pyramids
81:05 themselves
81:06 because pretty much in this timetable
81:08 the pyramids are
81:09 pretty uh rudimentary in its rediscovery
81:12 right
81:14 he ends up contracting with a car
81:17 company
81:18 and a watch company and ends up
81:24 building a speedometer that he also
81:27 patented which was used in a packard a
81:28 lincoln
81:29 and a pierce arrow luxury car
81:33 so in 1907 at the age of 51 this is
81:36 where tesla starts
81:38 really going to the next level of
81:41 creating inventions that we're most
81:43 interested in because they're pretty
81:45 amazing
81:47 now how did he get there well you just
81:49 certainly read off a ton of his
81:50 development a bunch of his patents
81:53 well again what was he doing he was
81:55 discovering how
81:56 to harness electricity in his bulk
81:58 course form and then through dozens and
82:00 dozens of patents
82:02 refining the absolute control and thus
82:04 understanding
82:05 how electricity works so now you can go
82:08 to the next level
82:10 there's an article published called
82:12 tesla's tidal wave to make war
82:13 impossible and this is where
82:17 tesla essentially stated that he had a
82:20 methodology of magnifying a transmission
82:23 transmitter to obtain 25 million
82:26 horsepower huge and this is about
82:32 10 years after tesla had really talked
82:34 about how x-rays work at the near
82:36 academy of sciences
82:39 he starts a new
82:42 laboratory which at the time was on
82:44 broadway
82:46 and he starts working on a vertical
82:49 takeoff and landing aircraft
82:52 i didn't know about this until i did my
82:53 research for this episode i thought that
82:55 was pretty cool
82:57 in 1909 at the age of 53 a nobel prize
83:00 is given to two physicists marconi and
83:04 braun
83:05 and recognition of their contributions
83:07 to the development of wireless
83:09 telegraphy and this is where tesla kind
83:11 of gets hurt
83:12 by the fact that here he is making that
83:15 object you know possible with all his
83:18 patents
83:19 and you know maybe he shares it with
83:21 those other three guys but he's not even
83:22 mentioned
83:23 very einsteiny kind of move right
83:25 einstein releases a paper in 1905 and
83:28 cites no sources meaning he invented
83:29 every single thing
83:31 that special relativity
83:35 was all about right same year
83:39 he's granted two patents
83:43 one for fluid propulsion and one for the
83:46 turbine
83:48 so in 1910 he's 54 years old
83:52 and he relocates his operations to the
83:55 metropolitan tower which at the time was
83:57 the tallest building
83:58 i believe in new york but this is the
84:00 year that mark twain dies
84:02 which sort of ripped his heart out and
84:06 he had a heart attack uh which is the
84:09 day after haley's comet came closest to
84:11 earth which is very interesting i saw
84:13 the next time it arrived
84:16 and it was said that years later on his
84:19 um very near his death tesla actually
84:22 tried to wire money
84:23 to uh mark twain so he wasn't quite with
84:26 it in his brain
84:28 why i don't know it was like maybe odin
84:30 50 bucks or something
84:34 so at 1911 at the age of 55
84:38 tesla was working on steam turbines
84:41 at the waterside station of new york
84:44 edison company
84:45 and he said that with a disc that was
84:48 nine inches in diameter
84:49 with two inches thick using steam as a
84:52 propulsive fluid he was able to generate
84:55 110 horsepower immediately but through
84:58 working with it he was going to be able
85:00 to actually double that
85:03 so in 1912 at the age of 56
85:06 remember that guy asked her that owned
85:08 him a hundred thousand dollars
85:10 well he was supposed to use the money to
85:12 develop a new lighting system but
85:13 instead he put his money
85:15 into that colorado springs experiment of
85:16 his
85:18 which eventually broke the relationship
85:20 he had with
85:21 astor and
85:24 they have what each other for quite a
85:26 while
85:27 and mr astor dies on the titanic he
85:31 saves his wife
85:32 into the uh uh the boat and then he ends
85:35 up
85:36 getting found days later and buried
85:39 it's kind of a bummer so
85:42 westinghouse church kerr and company
85:45 went and removed the machinery from the
85:47 building as part of their judgment for
85:49 twenty three thousand five hundred
85:50 dollars because i guess he
85:52 ended up owing money because he pays
85:53 bills
85:55 so in 1914 at the age of 58
85:58 george westinghouse actually dies at 67
86:01 years old
86:03 apparently his wife only lived another
86:05 three months they were described
86:07 westinghouse and tesla or described
86:09 affectionately as the perfect
86:10 partnership
86:11 because because of their relationship we
86:14 got what we
86:15 got out of tesla is massively
86:18 formative patenting years right this is
86:21 where
86:22 um tesla starts to not pay his bills
86:26 how you blow through that much money you
86:28 must have been really generous with his
86:30 pay and must have wanted like top
86:32 quality stuff because he just had a
86:34 tremendous amount of money
86:36 that particular year he was granted two
86:38 more patents
86:40 this uh the only bizarre patent out of
86:42 this particular one because the other
86:43 one is transmitting
86:44 electrical energy was a fountain patent
86:48 he got which was
86:51 an improvement in the construction of
86:52 fountains and aquarium displays
86:55 so pretty interesting where this guy
86:56 always ended up doing something actually
86:58 really creative on the sign so keep that
87:00 in mind if you're a creative person
87:02 right
87:04 so 1915 he's getting really close to
87:07 having his tower destroyed
87:12 uh the big thing about this he's 59
87:15 years old the new york times basically
87:17 floated this rumor that tesla and edison
87:21 were going to get a nobel prize in
87:22 physics
87:24 the problem was they ended up giving it
87:26 to two other dudes
87:27 and when asked you know why the hell
87:31 that happened
87:32 the nobel prize committee said well we
87:35 attempted to give it to tesla and edison
87:37 but
87:38 they hate each other so much that
87:39 neither one of them would go up while
87:41 the other one was accepting their award
87:43 so they didn't want to share it together
87:44 so they lost the opportunity of a
87:45 lifetime in my opinion
87:47 because back then a nobel prize really
87:49 meant something whereas today will give
87:50 it to al gore
87:53 this is also where tesla is
87:56 now knee-deep in hotel debt his one
88:01 hotel debt at the time was nineteen
88:03 thousand dollars
88:05 at the woolworth uh building
88:09 he ends up having to sign over his
88:12 wardencliff
88:13 land lease to uh
88:16 this dude um george bolt who was the
88:18 proprietor of the waldorf astoria
88:21 and so this is where he loses control
88:23 because he can't control his money
88:25 and again how you have so much money 250
88:28 000 within 10 years and you can't pay a
88:30 19 000
88:32 um hotel bill it's sort of
88:35 hysterical for a guy as brilliant as
88:37 tesla right
88:38 calculate it in your brain man they said
88:40 tesla could age ball bearings in his
88:42 brain for two years
88:43 and whether that's real or not his
88:46 autobiography
88:47 backs up that claim that's what he says
88:49 right
88:52 by 1916 he's 60 years old
88:55 now imagine being 60 in 1916.
88:59 he's pulled into the state supreme court
89:01 he has 935 dollars
89:03 in unpaid taxes on the warden cliff
89:07 property
89:08 and which is obviously state taxes for
89:10 the land and he has to admit
89:12 in court that he's penniless
89:17 so the new york world another
89:19 publication ran a super
89:21 embarrassing article on his financial
89:25 crisis he was having he's granted one
89:28 patent
89:28 that particularly you're on the speed
89:30 indicator
89:32 and it reads quickly as an improvement
89:35 that uses the adhesion and viscosity of
89:38 gaseous medium that's related to his
89:40 other discovery
89:41 to measure speed between the indicator
89:44 and the driver
89:45 durable simple inexpensive reliable
89:47 that's actually the patent statement
89:51 so in 1917 he's 61 years old and he
89:54 still got problems and this is where his
89:57 tower
89:58 gets liquidated because the media
90:02 had started a new report that and again
90:05 think about today about how this stuff
90:07 happens today
90:08 he's accused of being used by german
90:11 spies
90:14 and so uh with
90:19 uh people deceased he is now
90:22 having to check into a new hotel he's
90:24 got debts
90:26 no patents that particular year
90:29 1918 he's 62 years old he moves um into
90:34 a new hotel
90:35 st regis hotel uh one of new york's most
90:38 exclusive hotels because he hasn't
90:40 learned his lesson yet right
90:42 he just can't stop he just can't stop
90:44 you know
90:46 living the high life he's given two
90:47 patents that year one for
90:49 lighting protector and one for another
90:51 speed indicator improvement
90:54 so in 1919 the big deal was that
90:58 electrical experimenter magazine started
91:00 running a series
91:02 entitled my inventions by tesla
91:05 and in getting him to describe his
91:08 inventions
91:09 for the magazine the publicist was
91:13 eventually able to convince him to write
91:15 the autobiography
91:16 that i read that it's just amazing to
91:20 hear all in his voice
91:21 you know you really get a sense of who
91:22 the guy is
91:25 i mean in your head at least he's
91:28 granted one patent
91:29 for ship's log novel and
91:33 advantageous construction of ship's log
91:35 instantaneous reading of
91:37 knots of knots or miles per hour
91:40 in 1920 at the age of 64 he
91:43 is granted one more patent for a conduit
91:48 1921 65 he gets another patent
91:51 for a flow meter
91:55 and i'm meeting this to you so you can
91:56 understand how he's drifting around now
91:58 he's interested in a bunch of different
92:01 things
92:03 now in 1922 at the age of 66
92:07 uh it's important for us to start
92:09 mentioning
92:10 well it's really kind of the beginning
92:12 middle and end of this weird era in his
92:14 life where he
92:16 fell in love with pigeons which are not
92:18 indigenous to the united states
92:20 and uh if you ask a new yorker they're
92:22 sort of like flying rats
92:24 unless you're mike tyson and you love
92:25 him or lawrence fishburn
92:29 and so he
92:32 they romanticized this quite a bit but
92:34 he did say that there was a particular
92:36 female
92:37 pigeon that seemed to be more aware of
92:40 his
92:42 existence like they were friends or
92:43 something he sort of fell in love with
92:45 this little pigeon
92:47 and then on one particular evening it
92:50 flew up
92:50 and landed with him i think i think it
92:53 was in his hotel
92:55 and he said that the bird was telling
92:57 him
92:58 that it was about to die and he
93:00 described it as
93:02 this incredible light came from its eyes
93:07 and then it just died and
93:10 he said that um you know that
93:14 something in his life just died with him
93:18 like it was a huge thing to him
93:20 so that story is true and he was quoted
93:23 as you know
93:24 acknowledging that he also got a patent
93:26 that year for a frequency meter
93:30 in 1923 at the age of 67 he runs into
93:33 more hotel nightmares he's racked up a
93:35 three thousand dollar
93:36 bill for a seven month period
93:42 so he has to move to a new location
93:46 by 1924 the following year at 68
93:49 that 3000 bill was starting to get on
93:51 his
93:52 you know getting into more legal trouble
93:56 because he'd been pulled in and lost a
93:57 bunch of cases for his debts and a bunch
93:59 of other stuff and this dude who was a
94:01 croatian sculptor
94:02 who loved him started to
94:06 help him out with his debts
94:10 so by 1925 he's 69 years old which
94:13 again you know that's not terribly old
94:15 for that particular time i mean it's
94:17 definitely
94:18 you're you're older people did live a
94:21 long time back in those days but
94:22 um you know so we always wondered
94:25 whether or not
94:26 tesla ever had a girlfriend or a wife
94:29 and
94:31 this is sort of a crude statement but he
94:33 may have died without ever being with a
94:35 woman in his entire lifetime
94:37 he was in love with a woman named
94:39 catherine johnson
94:40 who was a wife of a very good friend of
94:43 his
94:44 and they apparently were known for
94:47 trading uh flirtatious letters but they
94:49 always kept it on the up and up
94:51 and when you look at the rest of tesla's
94:54 life and you hear the decisions he made
94:56 and the fact that he
94:57 did get pushed around a lot you know you
95:00 have to
95:01 you have to kind of assume that he
95:02 didn't cross any cross any lines there
95:06 so in 1926 at the age of 70
95:09 he receives two honorary doctorates
95:14 one from belgrade and one from zagreb so
95:17 back in his
95:18 home country starting to recognize how
95:20 amazing this dude is
95:22 in 1928 at the age of 72 he's granted
95:24 two more patents
95:25 for the method of aerial transportation
95:29 and apparatus for aerial transportation
95:33 what this was because you might think
95:36 he's creating a ufo of some sort he
95:38 certainly would have gotten there had he
95:40 lived another probably 50 lucid years
95:44 but he um was essentially trying to work
95:47 on
95:48 you know propeller based planes and
95:50 motors so that he could
95:52 control tilting and everything and he
95:53 probably would have pounded this out but
95:55 i don't think that anything ever
95:56 amounted of the particular research so
95:59 i will most likely create a tesla part
96:02 two
96:02 but we'll go into more of some of these
96:05 ancillary things that i found
96:07 during this research this particular one
96:10 is going to focus on
96:12 everything that's in the official story
96:14 plus the death rate at the end
96:17 1930 age 74 he's racked up another two
96:20 thousand dollars and his buddy
96:23 another guy came in to help him out
96:27 in 1931 at the age of 75 because he's 75
96:31 he gets a ton of letters from folks even
96:33 one from albert einstein
96:34 which i'm sure he used in the bathroom
96:37 he's put on the
96:38 front of time magazine and
96:41 um thomas edison dies
96:44 he was 84 years old and he's buried in
96:46 [Music]
96:49 the welland park in west orange new
96:51 jersey something i didn't know
96:54 okay so now we're in 1934. he's 78 years
96:58 old
97:00 he settles uh his disputes with the
97:03 westinghouse corporation they're going
97:04 to pay him 125 dollars a month he's
97:06 going to pay
97:07 monthly rent and expenses so immediately
97:10 he moves to the hotel new yorker where
97:12 he lives for free
97:13 for the rest of his life his debt to the
97:16 hotel
97:17 governor clinton clinton was never paid
97:20 and there's an article that he wrote
97:24 called the possibilities of
97:25 electrostatic generation it's published
97:27 published in scientific american which
97:29 is pretty cool
97:30 where he talks about a 2 million volt
97:33 generator
97:34 that i believe is on display in the
97:37 boston
97:38 museum of science which i've actually
97:39 been to i probably saw that and didn't
97:41 even know what the heck i was looking at
97:43 the city of philadelphia awards tesla
97:46 with the john scott medal of invention
97:48 for the rotating magnetic field and
97:49 induction motor
97:52 and then there's a headline on the front
97:54 page of the new york times that reads
97:55 tesla at age 78 bears new
97:59 death beam the article reported that the
98:02 new invention
98:03 will send concentrated beams of
98:05 particles through the free error
98:08 of such tremendous energy that they
98:10 bring down a fleet of 10
98:11 000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250
98:15 miles
98:18 this is where tesla throws down he's
98:20 going to end wars
98:22 so all these videos i see on youtube
98:24 which is like did he create the death
98:26 ray did he do this or did he do that
98:29 get the only thing in dispute is whether
98:30 or not he built the thing
98:32 his intention is a hundred percent now
98:36 one of the things i don't have in my
98:37 notes uh to read to you which is an
98:39 article
98:39 i decided to paraphrase it to you he
98:41 does take an interview which is probably
98:43 that particular
98:45 piece of work that i can't remember the
98:47 name of it but he talks about
98:49 um how to defeat mussolini for these
98:53 these other countries that are in europe
98:55 getting attacked by him or at least in
98:57 the um
98:58 baltic states of russia or what have you
99:00 and he
99:01 talks about all kinds of interesting
99:03 things like
99:05 because there was gas warfare you know
99:07 world war one
99:08 where you could drop bombs and you know
99:10 by world war ii they're they're capable
99:12 of
99:12 dropping these bomb canisters as well as
99:15 poison in them and
99:16 some of his solutions were simply
99:19 thinking
99:19 through his childhood playing in the
99:21 mountains where he said that people need
99:22 to rush to the mountains
99:24 so these barrels of toxicity are dropped
99:27 that the the properties of diffusion
99:31 with the air rushing up the hill people
99:33 will get sick but they won't die because
99:35 they won't get enough of the stuff in
99:36 their system
99:37 now he might have been a little bit um
99:39 on the optimistic side there
99:40 because sarin gas is pretty fast but
99:43 maybe it has to be a certain level of
99:44 parts per million before it actually
99:45 works
99:46 whether or not one survives you don't
99:48 hear those stories so i don't know
99:50 but he was thinking about it because the
99:52 war i think probably tore him up inside
99:56 now there's one article i have to find
99:58 because i found in my research and i
99:59 haven't found the actual article we'll
100:00 put this in the next episode but
100:02 1935 with egypt 79 just a few years
100:05 before he dies
100:08 it's quoted as the liberty magazine
100:10 article entitled a machine to end war
100:14 by this dude and he said essentially
100:17 that they asked him what the world was
100:18 going to be like in 2035
100:21 and 20 100. won't that be fascinating i
100:24 gotta find that article and
100:26 get it to you guys okay in 1937
100:31 he's 81 years old he receives two more
100:34 honorary doctorates
100:37 a lot of it has to do with him you know
100:38 being at home at the time marconi
100:40 the radio inventor dies
100:44 the most the most notable thing that
100:46 happens
100:48 is that around midnight tesla leaves his
100:51 hotel
100:52 to go feed his pigeons and he struck by
100:54 a taxi cab
100:56 and some people said he was thrown 35 40
100:58 feet away from this car
101:01 and the the most damage to his body they
101:05 said occurred was
101:06 three cracked ribs uh when he was asked
101:09 to tell everybody how well you know if
101:11 he's okay now again this dude is
101:13 81 years old all right imagine getting
101:15 hit at 81. i got
101:17 grandmothers that have died falling over
101:18 in their homes breaking their hips
101:20 less than that but he said it merely
101:22 caused customary bruises and upset my
101:25 digestion a bit
101:27 it was a baller let me tell you
101:31 uh one of his lifelong friends robert
101:33 underwood who wrote for the century
101:34 magazine
101:35 also died and he was a writer poet
101:37 diplomat
101:38 and editor of the magazine now the other
101:41 thing was
101:41 is that tesla now sees that war in
101:44 europe is going to happen you just can't
101:46 stop it so
101:48 he composes um a treatise entitled
101:51 the art of projecting concentrated
101:53 non-dispersive energy through the
101:55 natural media
101:57 he goes to the u.s war department and
102:00 europe allies
102:02 and tries to sell them this idea but
102:05 they won't have anything to do with it
102:09 look at our two days today what do we
102:10 know about war today
102:12 they're intentional they have problem
102:14 reaction solution formulas attached to
102:16 them
102:17 and they're trying to engineer the world
102:19 through those crises
102:21 and then projecting a narrative and
102:23 causing change
102:24 war ii was meant to happen okay for a
102:27 billion reasons
102:29 but that's probably why they didn't pay
102:31 much attention to them
102:34 so in 1938 at the age of 32 the most
102:36 notable thing
102:37 is that uh he was
102:41 visited by peter ii which i guess became
102:43 a ruler
102:44 in his serbian
102:47 roots and he was the yugoslav
102:51 but apparently tesla loved this guy and
102:53 basically said you know i think you're a
102:55 really upstanding
102:56 guy i think it'll be fantastic that you
102:58 become a leader
102:59 i know anything about that area of the
103:00 world i guess he did become a leader
103:02 you have to tell me
103:05 so in 1943 it's the final year of
103:08 tesla's life he's 86 years old
103:11 he that is he dies in his hotel room he
103:13 put the do not disturb sign on the
103:14 outside
103:15 but a maid who knew him just walked
103:17 right through that and found him dead in
103:18 his bed
103:19 uh the cause of death was deemed to be
103:22 coronary thrombosis
103:24 considering that he did live to be 86
103:26 years old
103:27 he lost two laboratories to fire
103:30 it almost seems like if anyone was after
103:32 him if any of those fires were
103:33 intentional
103:35 they had respect for the dude let that
103:37 guy live because he's generating a bunch
103:39 of patents we're gonna end up using a
103:40 monetizing later on
103:43 this is where we get the kids well the
103:45 true
103:46 potential conspiracy that the fbi
103:48 ordered the us office of alien property
103:51 to seize all of tesla's belongings and
103:53 the dude that sees
103:55 all of his stuff was donald dr j
103:58 g trump who was an electrical engineer
104:02 for the national defense research
104:03 committee of the office of scientific
104:06 research and development
104:08 so a lot of his paperwork
104:12 disappears for a long time now getting
104:15 it been lost in flyers
104:17 and again you think about alexander's
104:19 library
104:20 burning up and for those of us that
104:22 believe that anybody with the right mind
104:24 prior to burning the place would steal
104:26 all the books and then burn the place
104:27 then say oh yeah
104:28 all that information is gone and those
104:30 in power
104:31 um rock and roll with it right
104:35 but tesla was given a state funeral it
104:37 was attended by two thousand people
104:39 and then his body was eventually
104:42 cremated
104:43 and buried in um new york
104:47 now eventually his family came and got
104:49 his ashes and took them back
104:50 overseas which i think is kind of cool
104:55 so this is what's also interesting the
104:57 year that he dies there was this dispute
104:59 about marconi creating
105:01 the radio or tesla creating the radio
105:04 and apparently marconi was trying to sue
105:07 the us government
105:08 for the use of the radio during the war
105:11 and which was still going at the time
105:13 and so they eventually reviewed
105:15 tesla's paperwork from 1893 and
105:18 basically determined that
105:19 dude as much as you created the
105:21 information protocol across that wire
105:23 across the transmissions excuse me you
105:26 didn't invent the radio
105:27 and so they threw it out and dismissed
105:30 marconi's case against the us government
105:34 now by 1945 and the exact date i'm not
105:38 quite sure whether or not the war had
105:39 ended or not but
105:41 there was a big um i guess it was just
105:43 after the war ended okay
105:45 there was this huge renewed interest in
105:47 that being that he was talking about
105:48 right
105:50 and so they sent it to paterson air
105:52 force base
105:53 in dayton ohio right paterson air force
105:56 base
105:57 roswell
106:01 that's where they sent the the remains
106:03 of the roswell crash
106:07 but they created a project called
106:09 project nick nick
106:12 like the name heavily funded project
106:17 and so the results of all the
106:19 experiments were never published
106:23 and that the history is it was
106:25 apparently discontinued
106:27 okay remember what i told you about the
106:30 star wars satellites that were deployed
106:32 in the late 80s and then they told the
106:33 public that it was cancelled
106:35 and this is a bit of a formula brilliant
106:40 they did create a death mask of tesla
106:42 and in 1952 his buddy who was the
106:44 sculptor
106:46 created um a full statue of him which is
106:49 super cool and they created two as a
106:51 matter of fact now
106:54 before we go into the death ray
106:56 explanation of what i think it is
106:58 having reviewed his own paperwork i'm
107:00 gonna go over some
107:02 interesting little tidbits i found that
107:03 just aren't really
107:05 um year-to-year relevant
107:10 but tesla did talk about substances
107:13 drugs and
107:16 he essentially had figured out that um
107:20 that he said that a great mind needs a
107:23 stimulant of some sort now
107:24 coffee ended up wreaking havoc on his
107:27 system
107:28 because he's pretty sensitive but he has
107:30 some pretty interesting
107:31 um takes on drugs you know he said one
107:35 everything you do is gonna be taken and
107:38 enjoyed
107:38 sparingly so don't overdo it right he's
107:41 thought that chewing gum drains the
107:42 glandular system
107:44 which was revolting didn't like alcohol
107:47 much
107:48 he liked tobacco he thought tobacco
107:50 eases the mind
107:53 but he also thought that abstinence
107:55 abstinence
107:57 was a restriction that led him to
108:00 enjoy or to work better very interesting
108:04 i mean yes i guess if you have sex
108:05 you're not brilliant what am i doing
108:07 wrong
108:10 now about his health he had some very
108:11 interesting things
108:13 about health he had a few physical
108:17 accidents in his life he said that up to
108:19 the age of 60
108:20 he thought his eyes were working
108:21 fantastically
108:24 he said for 35 well he said pretty much
108:26 his whole life okay
108:28 the book that i read that he's talking
108:30 about himself ends in 1919
108:33 but he said that there was a day when he
108:36 was working in the edison factory that
108:38 there where they were having some party
108:39 or something like this they were in a
108:40 room and he's with edison they're still
108:42 friends and
108:43 somebody somebody challenged edison to
108:46 guess his weight
108:48 and he's like oh yeah i'll do it you
108:49 know as he comes up and grabs his body
108:51 and looks him up and down and goes 152
108:53 pounds
108:54 tesla goes that's right dressed i'm 152
108:58 pounds
108:59 buck naked i'm 142. and so he asked
109:02 somebody how the hell do you know how to
109:04 do that he goes well it's a little
109:05 secret
109:06 that um edison used to work on like a
109:10 pig farm
109:11 and so he's always handling cattle and
109:12 just knew what things weighed and so
109:14 that's how he had that
109:16 he said that when he was a kid um he had
109:19 a uh
109:21 he had this affliction towards insects
109:24 because one of his buddies ate a june
109:26 bug right in front of his face which i
109:27 guess
109:28 i guess is a may bug over in europe
109:30 which was pretty pretty funny
109:32 but he was a typical kid you know they
109:34 used to carve wood swords and
109:35 play you know swashbuckling games
109:37 cutting down stocks of uh
109:40 corn which i'm sure is unless it was
109:41 harvest time his father probably would
109:43 have kicked his butt
109:45 when he was a little kid in his his
109:48 hometown which i don't remember maybe
109:49 it's like
109:50 teenage years or something there was a
109:51 problem with a fire truck during a fire
109:54 and he went and fixed it really quickly
109:56 and he put the fire out he became a
109:58 little celebrity in his hometown which i
109:59 thought was pretty cool
110:02 he used to be able to catch crows by
110:04 doing this weird whistle
110:05 and then distracting them and then i
110:06 guess coming up behind and grabbing him
110:08 which everyone just thought was just
110:10 while when he was a kid
110:14 at one point my little kid he actually
110:15 jumped off a roof with an umbrella
110:17 to to shock his fall and departing
110:20 himself pretty bad was a point when he
110:24 was in school
110:26 that uh and he really credited his
110:28 father by the way with a ton of his
110:29 teachings
110:31 uh but he said that he got the highest
110:32 grades ever in school and his professor
110:34 actually want to give him more credit
110:36 but his father was
110:38 terrified that if he got super
110:40 celebrated at school that he'd never
110:42 leave the house and so he told his um
110:45 he told the teacher his father told the
110:47 teacher not to give him any more
110:48 accolades so he would get out and play
110:50 with his buddies which i think is great
110:54 the other thing is he has this ritual
110:55 which is one of my diseases which is
110:58 he was a stickler about finishing
111:00 anything that he
111:01 that he began and so i'll warn you
111:04 against that
111:05 it can be absurd sometimes you're like
111:08 don't finish that that's just a waste
111:10 your time you know
111:11 it's up to you what you do with your
111:12 life but definitely be careful
111:14 establishing that regimen at a young age
111:16 because you can get yourself upside down
111:20 he said that he had phenomenal hearing
111:24 and in his autobiography he describes
111:25 this in great detail but he said that he
111:27 could hear a
111:29 thunder from 550 miles away when his
111:33 young companion could only hear 150
111:35 miles away
111:36 which how the hell they know that i
111:37 guess by the flash and then when the
111:39 sound gets to you can definitely
111:41 calculate that on average
111:43 but he said he could hear now again this
111:44 could be the hubris
111:46 of a nerdy type person okay definitely
111:48 been around people like this in my
111:50 years in the gaming industry but he said
111:52 he could hear a
111:54 watch on a guy's hand uh
111:57 three rooms away i mean
112:00 i can hear a watch in the room no
112:02 problem i'm always like who's got the
112:04 clicker
112:05 i think you can hear that i can't even
112:06 hear it's online i'm like yeah i can
112:08 hear it
112:09 i don't know what to do i don't know
112:10 what to do about it right
112:13 but he said he had to sleep on a rubber
112:15 cushion
112:16 because sound vibrations would you know
112:19 make him really uneasy
112:21 you should do what i do just sleep with
112:23 a
112:24 ear plug in one ear and that reduces the
112:26 amount of electricity goes into your
112:27 brain at night so you can sleep really
112:29 well you can still hear everything in
112:30 the room
112:31 especially with my hearing but at least
112:33 takes down the really cute stuff
112:34 that'll uh keep you awake forever i
112:37 don't know exactly what year he became a
112:39 telegrapher i think it was
112:41 during his college years in europe but
112:44 he definitely was a
112:44 telegrapher so he learned marsh code
112:46 really really well
112:49 and he actually created a booster to
112:51 amplify the signal and just immediately
112:53 filed it to the public domain
112:56 so now we're at the end of the giant
112:58 recap so that you can get a
113:01 understanding of this guy now
113:05 here's the thing we have
113:08 obviously a guy who is massively
113:12 prolific in terms of his writings his
113:15 diagrams he does his own stuff
113:17 he hates his freehand drawings by the
113:19 way they're pretty damn good
113:22 one of the listeners was gracious enough
113:23 to share about six pages
113:26 of tesla's handwritten notes
113:29 and it definitely takes deciphering
113:31 because he wrote it in a cursive writing
113:33 and it's not too bad i mean you know you
113:36 can get into
113:37 by reading the other words you can
113:39 decipher what one of the middle words is
113:41 but this has a giant tower which is
113:45 similar to the warden cliff tower
113:48 but it's a lot narrower narrower in
113:50 design and goes straight up like a light
113:53 tower
113:54 and has a ball on top that's made out of
113:57 paneled steel
113:58 okay there's a tremendous amount of
114:00 formulas
114:02 in the paperwork and once you read
114:05 mark bean's book on the tesla coil
114:08 a lot of this becomes understandable
114:12 but here's the difference with the tesla
114:15 coil
114:16 you actually have a device that will
114:18 emit
114:20 what they call hair it's the electricity
114:22 comes off of either the top
114:24 spool of the tesla coil or you can
114:27 attach devices to it like a
114:29 piece of steel it's like a big long
114:31 pencil and it just rotates and you can
114:33 squirt off that
114:34 basically just has to dissipate the the
114:37 current that's on the thing right
114:40 okay but now where
114:43 were all the patents headed headed
114:47 headed before he starts talking about
114:49 this
114:50 this death beam it was all about
114:53 wireless transmission
114:55 it was also a he studied induction
114:59 inductance right
115:00 conductivity and resonance
115:04 hmm okay some of that he discovered
115:08 some of that other people discovered and
115:09 he simply perfected it
115:12 now if you think about the idea of let's
115:15 say
115:16 the bullet so the bullet is initially
115:19 invented as a round ball
115:21 you got to put some flint in there some
115:22 powder pack it put the ball in front of
115:24 it then you have a little fuse on the
115:26 outside of a rifle
115:27 like boom boom boom there goes the
115:30 little civil war or exceeding the
115:32 revolutionary war
115:34 black powder things going to go through
115:35 your body then we had cannons
115:38 artillery napoleon was an amazing
115:41 artillery guy calculus major
115:45 so this as just staying with the bullet
115:47 for one second as a vector
115:49 of how things can develop standing on
115:52 each other's shoulders right
115:54 you've got a situation where you have
115:56 the bullet then becomes a cartridge
115:58 no longer do you have to put all this
116:00 gunpowder from a little pouch into the
116:02 barrel and then
116:02 pack it and you know it's this really
116:04 slow war like i could die any second
116:05 this is awesome right
116:07 nope it turns into the winchester rifle
116:09 civil war crazy lady who lives in san
116:11 jose
116:12 with her crazy house
116:15 where did the bullet go i mean where did
116:17 it go the shells kept getting bigger and
116:19 bigger and bigger
116:20 it's to the uh world war two you got
116:22 these giant battleships man
116:25 now you have a freaking bullet that's
116:27 you know the size of a
116:29 trash can you know headed over to the
116:31 mainland to bomb
116:33 installments right well
116:37 eventually that kind of bullet kind of
116:39 takes its full toll it's refined it's a
116:41 gun
116:42 it's a 22 caliber thing i mean you know
116:45 it's on tanks and stuff
116:47 we switched over to new technology that
116:50 was sort of unthinkable which is just
116:52 bombs what can you make a bomb out of
116:55 well eventually as rumor housing they
116:57 made a nuclear bomb
116:59 and then they kept refining what the
117:01 active ingredient was to get the
117:03 nuclear bomb to go full fission
117:07 now they've got neutron bomb rumors
117:09 they've got hydrogen bombs
117:11 which have to take well previously
117:13 hydrogen bombs needed atom bombs to
117:16 ignite which then leaves a radio
117:18 radioactive
117:19 signature in it it also happens to
117:21 create emp so they can do emp
117:23 electrical bombs so okay
117:27 think about it tesla's trying to improve
117:30 a peaceful world he's trying to spread
117:32 electricity everywhere
117:33 using alternating current because things
117:36 can be made to spin right
117:38 well electrical system like a dc
117:41 wire is just straight power
117:45 a rotating engine is going to have
117:48 one half of the sine cosine wave go
117:52 up and down all positive but when it
117:54 rotates underneath
117:55 it's going to create a negative
117:57 underneath it's going to have another
117:59 wave that's going the other way
118:00 and then back up and then back down back
118:02 up so a lot of his
118:04 ac perfection was to create this coil
118:09 that could capacitate power to a point
118:12 where it's trying to go
118:13 underneath it stays in a positive using
118:16 this resonance system
118:17 that might be a little bit confusing but
118:20 you don't have to understand that stuff
118:22 he fixed it he fixed all the teeny tiny
118:24 components
118:26 that harvest this rotation that harvests
118:29 electricity
118:30 out of the universe out of conductive
118:33 materials
118:34 you know static electricity all this
118:35 good stuff right okay
118:39 what we don't have above ground to my
118:42 knowledge okay if you got it let me know
118:46 is essentially what we now perceive
118:49 as the directed energy weapon which
118:53 absolutely positively exists i've got
118:55 friends of mine and hobby
118:58 hobbies on the side they were in
119:00 laboratories building all kinds of
119:01 different things
119:02 they were able to create a system where
119:05 they were able to take a paper clip
119:06 put it on this electrical unit that they
119:08 created turn it on a paper clip just
119:10 vaporizes
119:12 okay that's the same principle on a
119:14 minute level
119:15 that your directed energy weapons works
119:17 now if i had to guess
119:19 i think that a direct energy weapon is a
119:22 device that is
119:23 primarily in orbit using
119:26 wires that hang out the back or maybe
119:28 it's just gathering capacitating in a
119:30 giant coil using the van allen belts
119:32 which are very
119:33 electrical even in my new amount right
119:36 tesla approved and my new amount can be
119:38 coiled up
119:38 capacitated up to have pretty much
119:41 infinite power
119:42 it's probably a point where the circuit
119:43 just hasn't gone full don't need anymore
119:46 then with a particular literally
119:50 pieces of conductive metal you could
119:53 point it
119:54 like a laser and zap a particular
119:57 diameter on the ground depending on how
119:58 you
119:59 squeeze the beam obviously the wider the
120:02 beam the more electricity you need to
120:03 keep it strong enough to do anything
120:05 smaller and tighter less power
120:08 what's happening is this all those
120:11 nuclear
120:12 bonds that are holding all the atoms
120:13 together are getting interrupted
120:17 now if you go to an ethereal model of
120:18 the universe such as tesla
120:21 back to faraday did every invention was
120:24 based on the manipulation
120:26 of ether again physicists after
120:29 tesla who didn't invent anything who
120:31 didn't patent anything
120:33 again einstein's nobel prize
120:36 barnacled price was based on a
120:38 photoelectric effect that he had no
120:40 knowledge of how it worked when he did
120:41 lectures around the world scientists
120:43 were like we asked him basic questions
120:44 he didn't even know his own
120:46 nobel prize invention works they put him
120:48 on the nobel prize so they would get the
120:50 nobel prize
120:51 it's a little little trick-a-roo of
120:54 getting awards right
120:57 i'm assuming at some point through just
121:00 sheer erosion
121:01 of using his electrical equipment he
121:04 probably realized
121:05 that the materials that were used in his
121:07 devices were eroding
121:09 the more electricity the more he got
121:11 erosion
121:12 colorado springs might have been the
121:15 catalyst because that was the most
121:18 insane tesla coil ever created by tesla
121:22 again the wharton cliff tower would have
121:25 been
121:26 the the big opus of his career
121:29 but it was never turned on big bummer
121:34 so in this paperwork about this tower
121:37 of which does not say anywhere on it
121:39 that i i remember
121:41 um you know death ray or
121:44 death beam or anything like that
121:48 everything is strategically
121:51 created its height its width its
121:54 diameter
121:55 the amount of power that would be put
121:57 inside this thing
121:58 most of that is obfuscated but through
122:00 equations in the documentation
122:02 and if you read the average equations
122:04 related to a tesla coil
122:06 it all starts to match up but now
122:09 what's not happening okay
122:14 the romantic version of a tesla coil in
122:16 a video game
122:17 especially um tiberian sun by westwood
122:20 studios one of my favorite studios i
122:22 ended up working for for about a year
122:24 you build a tesla coil it's in a bunch
122:26 of video games right and it zaps
122:27 everybody it goes by
122:28 like this tower defense game and all the
122:30 troops go by it's just zap zap steps out
122:32 now you could create that and it would
122:34 definitely have an amazing effect but
122:36 then you just fared a
122:37 the um vehicle and you'd probably be
122:40 okay
122:41 now faraday faraday's cage only works
122:43 with one principle
122:45 and that is that the electric electrical
122:47 frequency that's hitting the
122:48 faraday cage remains at the same
122:50 frequency if it's crawling up and down
122:52 the frequency spectrum
122:54 it can go through the faraday cage and
122:55 kill you so
122:57 luckily for us lightning bolts are
122:59 pretty much a solid
123:01 frequency and it's so duper fast so
123:03 super fast when it's a plane you're
123:05 perfectly fine right your car you're
123:06 usually fine
123:07 and when you're dealing with electronics
123:09 the tesla coil
123:11 level and if you're an electrician tell
123:13 all your friends not to kill themselves
123:14 but you don't want to be wearing
123:16 you know only barefoot on the ground you
123:18 don't know where rubber or
123:19 leather soles when you bring plastic or
123:22 rubber
123:23 there's a lot of ppe boots out there
123:25 that are greeted for
123:28 electricians again i don't think
123:29 anyone's going to be building a testicle
123:31 because they watch this show
123:32 but if you get into it understand it's a
123:33 very dangerous thing you can kill
123:35 yourself
123:36 in a second in your backyard you can
123:38 literally plug in and test the coil
123:40 that's a tabletop testicle cost you 500
123:42 bucks and you can die on the first use
123:44 if you just stand too close to it mess
123:46 around with it and we're talking
123:48 instantaneous death okay
123:49 so be super duper careful with all this
123:51 stuff
123:53 but now what was tesla talking about in
123:55 his article he talked about
123:57 a tower that's going to create this beam
124:01 that can knock 10 000 planes out of the
124:03 sky
124:04 at 250 miles it's pretty intense it's
124:08 not you know
124:09 forever in terms of you know distance
124:11 it's about 2000 miles between england
124:13 and
124:14 canada over the pacific right as marconi
124:17 approved
124:19 he's talking about uh basically a
124:22 transparent beam
124:23 of power that until it reaches
124:27 the frequency of which the beam
124:30 is resonating towards this conductive
124:34 material
124:36 it won't do anything at all it's
124:38 completely visible
124:39 well that's induction you can take your
124:42 phone
124:42 on one of those little chargers in your
124:44 house and you could actually technically
124:46 put your hand on it without the
124:47 telephone nothing's happening because
124:48 you're not what it's looking for
124:50 the little gritty uh
124:54 sticker of metal on the back of your
124:55 battery inside your phone is picking up
124:58 the power coming out of that charger and
125:02 using inductance to charge the battery
125:05 it's basically transmitting wireless
125:07 technology you know the tesla's the
125:08 a bunch of electric cars can park over
125:11 this thing on the ground and it charges
125:13 the car
125:14 without plugging it in it's slower than
125:17 being plugged directly into the wall of
125:18 course so how does this
125:20 death beam work well
125:24 it's exactly like the theories of the
125:27 now
125:28 completely existent directed energy
125:29 weapon
125:31 one can figure out what the plane's made
125:34 out of
125:35 dial in the frequency that particular
125:37 metal aluminum
125:39 metal whatever imagine this
125:43 imagine that the plane is made of mostly
125:45 aluminum
125:47 but the bolts of a particular plane at a
125:50 very specific point
125:53 is uh are our steel
125:57 stainless steel bolts okay
126:00 well you've got kind of a faraday
126:03 cage that is the vehicle itself
126:06 but if you could direct a beam that's
126:09 got a high level of frequency
126:12 you're no longer going to allow the
126:14 faraday cage technique to work
126:16 that electricity will crawl all over the
126:18 outside of the vehicle
126:20 and initially strip it now if you can
126:23 make it aluminum and the whole thing's
126:24 made of aluminum imagine
126:27 you're flying a plane and it just
126:29 vanishes
126:30 and it's thermalizing at the same time
126:32 so you're burning up
126:34 it's right inside the opening act of
126:38 a day the earth stood still when gort
126:40 the robot after they shoot klatsu's hand
126:43 and you've got the thing that's got all
126:44 the answers to life universe and
126:46 everything and this idiot shoots it with
126:47 the 45
126:49 he grabs his hand he's like oh my god
126:51 gort's little door comes up and he's
126:53 like you
126:53 are screwed he just zaps everything
126:55 right you see everything melt in
126:57 everybody's hands
126:58 the tanks melt the guys have to jump out
127:00 of the tank so they don't melt inside
127:02 the tank
127:03 now what they don't tell you is that the
127:05 ordinance would have exploded
127:07 but we'll just let that go so
127:10 one you could take the whole plane out
127:13 two you could just take the components
127:15 out
127:16 the motors are always exposed because
127:18 there's always a
127:19 you know an air intake into a motor
127:21 jamming air through it so it doesn't
127:22 overheat
127:23 but here comes that electricity
127:26 it metabolizes into power right when it
127:29 hits the metal
127:31 and blasts it away now i'm assuming that
127:34 when tesla was testing his inductions
127:38 his induction techniques he might have
127:40 fried some stuff
127:41 it was like oh gosh i gotta create a
127:43 regulator i got to create more
127:46 control over my electronics because look
127:48 what i just did
127:50 now you fast forward from 1888
127:53 all the way up to this impending 1937
127:57 and you got a huge problem on your hands
128:00 so in my opinion the
128:04 the only application he could have done
128:07 would be one of two things okay he would
128:10 be doing
128:12 a direct directed energy weapon to
128:15 literally
128:15 vaporize particular metals or conducted
128:18 materials in a particular
128:20 device could be relying on
128:23 lesser components such as copper wires
128:26 gold fittings anything that's a part of
128:28 hardware from that 1937
128:32 era when he started conceiving of this
128:34 thing
128:35 now you might think in a modern day
128:38 implementation it could be enp
128:40 well a lot of the electronics that would
128:42 make something work were
128:44 minimal and inventions in 37 so you
128:47 wouldn't have
128:49 a bunch of microchips everywhere that
128:51 could vaporize and cause the problem
128:53 that we're talking about
128:55 so in my opinion the only thing you
128:57 could possibly do
128:59 would either be vaporize the vehicle
129:02 or somehow create
129:06 a dead pilot a dead bunch of soldiers
129:11 but because tesla was definitely not one
129:14 to
129:16 try and kill humans even though what
129:18 he's talking about knocking planes out
129:20 of the sky would definitely render
129:23 those operating the vehicles dead
129:27 i'm thinking that he's more like the day
129:30 that was
129:30 ersted still trying to get rid of the
129:32 actual guns
129:34 the tanks anything of any nature because
129:37 remember
129:38 he said this tower makes
129:41 war impossible a war is a bunch of stuff
129:45 man
129:46 unless you had basically wood baseball
129:49 bats
129:49 or would this and would that
129:53 war would be reduced down to like
129:55 primitive caveman stuff
129:58 right so
130:01 you know what isn't described in the
130:03 documentation
130:04 is this 250 mile reach it isn't talking
130:07 about
130:08 killing anybody in planes it's not
130:10 talking about vaporizing things but i do
130:12 believe that through
130:15 several hundred if not thousands of
130:17 mistakes that happened
130:19 in his laboratory where things got
130:20 vaporized and him attempting to do
130:22 things
130:24 he basically turned that negative into
130:26 technically a positive that you're
130:27 talking about ending war
130:29 now why wouldn't someone be interested
130:31 in this device today in 2020 i mean
130:34 aren't we all about peace well
130:37 the kids go yeah i don't understand that
130:38 and the adults are like yeah war
130:42 is the way these neanderthal leaders of
130:45 ours
130:46 not just the politicians that you know
130:47 their names but the bankers and the
130:49 monarchies
130:50 they love war it's how they get
130:53 everything done
130:54 right you know we had a war on terror
130:56 for a really long time and
130:58 america switches presidents and this
131:00 terrorist faction is wiped out in
131:03 a year i mean wipes completely out that
131:05 doesn't stop
131:06 other little things from happening in
131:08 other wars from happening
131:10 but you know our problem is uh
131:11 liquidated
131:14 now i'm obviously going to continue
131:17 doing research but i wanted to touch on
131:19 one other topic before we
131:22 in this episode because it's going to be
131:23 really long
131:25 and that would be the talk
131:28 of tesla inventing time
131:31 research through the colorado springs
131:36 lightning bolt where it said that he saw
131:38 time warp now again i
131:40 didn't see any of this and that
131:42 experiment was finished
131:44 by 1919 when he wrote his own
131:46 autobiography
131:47 now let's think about this tesla's a
131:50 geek
131:51 he is he gets super duper excited about
131:53 the smallest little thing in the whole
131:55 world
131:56 because to him it's a huge thing he
131:57 realized that before he
131:59 invented a solution for something no
132:01 solution existed
132:03 without his solutions you don't get
132:05 higher
132:06 construct inventions like the radio
132:10 so now let's think about this just think
132:11 about it logically for a second okay
132:14 the book of his autobiography was
132:16 published in 1919
132:19 there are physical copies of it in the
132:20 world and you can't get rid of every
132:22 single copy of it in the world
132:23 especially if you look at it and it's
132:25 really old you know
132:27 you know it's old okay plus we do have
132:30 people that live
132:31 to be 100 years old think about that i
132:34 mean they can't read it when they're one
132:35 years old but
132:36 we would have had people talking about
132:38 this i read this tesla book and he
132:39 talked about time travel
132:42 here's what i assure you if
132:46 tesla had even a inkling
132:49 that he was going to be able to control
132:52 time with one of his inventions
132:54 it would have erased
132:58 a tremendous amount of his agenda after
133:01 that little indication occurred in
133:03 colorado springs if that's where you
133:05 believe it occurred
133:07 now again i read about
133:10 his life from different angles i never
133:12 had i've never seen any official book
133:14 including his autobiography
133:16 we know why editors would would
133:19 potentially be influenced to get rid of
133:21 you know
133:22 things that talk about things that are
133:24 potentially dangerous
133:25 for our enemies to get a hold of wait
133:27 just plug a battery and make a tesla
133:29 coil and you travel back in time
133:31 okay time travel in itself is
133:34 something that i've done a couple
133:35 episodes on probably the best one i've
133:38 done if you're interested in it is to
133:40 look at the episode on project looking
133:42 glass
133:42 just look that up go to
133:43 deepthoughtsradio.com look up
133:46 glass in the search field you'll find it
133:48 instantaneously
133:50 i explain a tremendous amount of the
133:52 misunderstandings
133:54 of time travel i've also got an episode
133:56 called this time
133:57 exists and that'll handle the more
133:59 theoretical side of what time is
134:03 so in my opinion
134:07 you would have patents being filed
134:10 for any indication of even slowing time
134:15 he would have patented you how'd you
134:17 like to go into an amusement park ride
134:19 slash carnival 19 well shoot man you
134:23 gotta have it during uh
134:24 the dust bowl carnival era right it
134:26 would have been plug this machine in
134:29 and you go in this room and friends are
134:31 going to run by
134:32 and they're going to be in slow motion
134:34 right that'd be a cool effect wouldn't
134:35 it
134:36 he would have done that remember i read
134:39 to you all those little patents he did
134:41 an ozone machine he perfected um
134:45 turbines of little switches and all
134:46 kinds of weird stuff for
134:48 aeronautical stuff he was patenting
134:51 every single thing that he could patent
134:54 and i think that would be
134:58 utterly ludicrous to believe that he
135:00 would have touched on time travel
135:02 without leaving behind a published
135:05 paper scientific america
135:08 he could have even said like he said
135:10 with his death rate the death ray is the
135:11 real one
135:12 the death beam or whatever you want to
135:14 call it the beam to end all the weapon
135:16 to end all wars to make wars impossible
135:19 that he talked about at length through
135:21 interviews through papers
135:24 again these documents i'm going to be
135:26 scrolling by
135:28 the screen during that previous section
135:31 definitely look like the tesla coil that
135:34 would be the death ray
135:35 catalyst now let's think about this
135:40 here is one of the unfortunate things
135:42 about our world
135:44 and hopefully this is the news to you
135:46 the rich and powerful of this world
135:49 who if you really need to know who i'm
135:51 talking about
135:52 you just ask who owns that bank and then
135:55 when they give you an answer you go who
135:56 loans that bank
135:58 give you an answer give an answer you
135:59 keep going until there's no other person
136:01 when you reach the end of that you've
136:03 reached the tippy top people that i'm
136:05 talking about
136:06 and you're going to find out that you're
136:08 not allowed to know their names
136:09 okay so i have monarchs all over the
136:12 planet
136:13 except in america okay so
136:17 order to build that
136:21 beam that makes war impossible it would
136:24 have to be much
136:25 much more powerful today because we have
136:27 a lot more arsenal
136:29 out there you're going to be stuck in
136:31 tesla's shoes
136:32 you're going to need today hundreds of
136:35 millions of dollars to build this device
136:37 at least the land the construction the
136:40 testing
136:41 more testing but you know that'll never
136:43 happen because it poses a national
136:45 security threat to any country that
136:47 would be allowing it to occur
136:50 so that device will never be built
136:55 to end wars it will be by to fight wars
137:00 maybe as a defense shield it'll be used
137:03 but
137:05 but any country that develops it's going
137:07 to use it for
137:08 offense as well as defense completely
137:11 negating
137:12 tesla's good soul so the summation of
137:16 tesla
137:17 is from my perspective as you have a
137:19 very innocent
137:20 wonderful human being he is
137:26 he had some simple rules that could be
137:27 construed as narcissism but it would be
137:29 essentially
137:31 he sort of wanted credit where credit
137:33 was due
137:34 i don't think for any second he needed
137:37 awards
137:39 i think that if you could inspire him
137:41 with money
137:42 attached to the award the nobel prize
137:44 comes with a fair chunk of change i
137:46 can't remember what it was back in his
137:47 era
137:49 maybe he got us all through it
137:52 to take the money because he could turn
137:54 that into research
137:56 i think it's interesting that the only
137:58 real
137:59 and who knows what kind of mindset he
138:02 had towards the end but the only
138:04 claim of like mental perhaps dementia
138:08 would have been his inability to pay his
138:10 hotel bills that's about it but i really
138:12 don't think that that was the case i
138:13 think he just realized
138:14 we got a few more years to live let's
138:16 just milk this thing plus i'm famous
138:18 right
138:20 what was interesting about tesla
138:23 and his creations is that he so gave to
138:26 the world
138:26 everything that he made that these
138:29 hotels charging him money to stay
138:32 was sort of that old analogy i gave you
138:34 a long time ago that if you invented a
138:36 zero point energy system
138:38 don't hold your invention back to make
138:40 money
138:41 because if you release it to the world
138:43 the whole world stops paying for
138:44 electricity and anywhere you go you get
138:46 free gas
138:47 free meal free lodging free everything
138:49 because you've just wiped out trillions
138:52 of dollars for the revenue that
138:53 fuel these crazy nut bags that love war
138:57 which is the cage that we're trapped in
139:00 because we're just idiots you know
139:04 so anyway hopefully you enjoyed the
139:06 finale episode
139:08 of season five thank you for waiting so
139:10 long for this i'm gonna do a double
139:12 header out the door
139:13 i won't say what that episode is in case
139:15 i changed my mind about that episode at
139:16 a future point
139:19 but uh we're gonna go continue with the
139:21 bonus episodes
139:22 until season six debut and so i
139:25 appreciate all of you
139:26 hanging on for a really long time to all
139:28 those who donate to this show special
139:30 thanks
139:31 it's just a buck it means the same
139:33 appreciate that but that's where you go
139:35 to detox radio dot com for all the feeds
139:37 video audio social media lock facebook
139:40 group that's really awesome
139:42 we have again a couple ways to donate
139:45 which is paypal direct
139:46 or patreon it just helps provide
139:49 time to come up with these massive
139:51 episodes
139:53 the other one is we have a all new
139:55 remastered season one
139:56 so it's often a different channel just
139:58 be aware that that's the case
140:00 and we also have a store which is going
140:03 to get some play
140:04 because i'm building a different one and
140:05 figuring out all kinds of cool stuff so
140:07 everything takes time right now the big
140:09 focus is on the intro of season five
140:12 for season six excuse me three seven so
140:15 all right take care of yourself and
140:18 somebody else and i will see you
140:19 in the next deep thoughts over now
140:31 [Applause]
140:37 [Applause]
140:44 [Applause]
140:56 uh
141:01 you
