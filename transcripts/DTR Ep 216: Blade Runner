00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to D so ladies and
00:37 gentlemen I hope you have good weather
00:40 wherever you are
00:42 but given that these YouTube videos and
00:46 video videos can sit online for a really
00:48 long time you can be seeing this in the
00:52 winter time as you can see this episode
00:56 is going to be about a movie that unlike
01:00 rollerball is not necessarily a giant
01:03 prophecy of what's to come
01:05 it's just one of the coolest movies on
01:07 planet Earth but it Feldon understood by
01:13 the younger audiences that for no fault
01:15 of their own they believe it is sort of
01:20 a copy of things that they have seen
01:22 more recently so we're going to have
01:26 some fun here
01:27 I just remembered I've got a
01:29 acquaintance of Mines book written on
01:32 the subject if you like the movie Blade
01:36 Runner already then there's a book you
01:39 need to purchase if you don't already
01:41 have it it's called future new war than
01:45 making a Blade Runner written by Paul
01:47 Sam on si mm o n FF dinner with Paul a
01:54 couple times been to a car show with him
01:57 very cool dude so we have a couple
02:00 things here we're going to have the
02:02 normal storyline of Blade Runner I'm
02:04 going to tell you some some of the
02:06 reasons why it's become an heirloom to
02:07 me just like rollerball 1975
02:10 by the way it doesn't have the number 75
02:13 and it but I have to distinguish it from
02:14 its prequel which was painful even
02:21 though it stars a friend of mine we've
02:24 never talked about that and that doesn't
02:26 have to come up that's not to say
02:28 anything about it but there's a little
02:32 there's a little known fact meaning very
02:36 few people know this particular fact but
02:39 it has been communicated to the creators
02:41 of the film at least several of them
02:43 that there are three films that have
02:45 been protected in a sort of Iron
02:51 Mountain vault like a fault tech system
02:57 that if weird ever experienced some sort
02:59 of man-made Cataclysm three films will
03:01 survive Wizard of Oz Gone with the Wind
03:06 and Blade Runner and the interesting
03:10 thing is Blade Runner is not even in the
03:12 top 20 films grossing films I'm not sure
03:14 it's in the top hundred and what's
03:19 interesting about it is for those who
03:21 know the film you usually love the film
03:25 Blade Runner sort of like Shakespearean
03:28 writing the one thing you never get
03:30 caught doing in this world is insulting
03:33 Shakespeare that's a no-no and one thing
03:37 you don't do is insult Blade Runner now
03:41 I have some friends of my debate
03:42 competing science fiction films and
03:44 they'll say something bad about Blade
03:46 Runner but we know where their criticism
03:48 comes from comes from so let's get into
03:51 it
03:53 I'm going to tell you some of the
03:55 principles or some of the start of the
03:56 foundational things about the film
03:58 that's very interesting and then I'm
04:00 going to start kind of cruising through
04:02 the film very lightly because it is
04:04 definitely something to experience if
04:06 you didn't know the film was directed by
04:10 Ridley Scott Ridley Scott was known for
04:14 being a commercial director and the UK
04:18 Scotland European area he had filmed as
04:21 I was told thousands of commercials but
04:24 having
04:24 friends that have filmed commercials
04:26 non-stop for 30 years and they're
04:28 nowhere near a thousand I find that
04:30 number to be very inflated but he also
04:34 shot the famous 1984 Apple commercial
04:37 that you saw this was long after these
04:40 films were made but his first film was
04:43 alien which we can all usually contest
04:47 is one of the most amazing films of its
04:50 kind it was the first film to create
04:51 really a super serious scary film with
04:55 an alien in it and I know that I don't
04:57 have the cultural ability to appreciate
05:00 what was done in the 50s and perhaps
05:03 maybe a couple films in the 60s but by
05:05 1979 when we saw HR Giger Zaillian
05:08 come alive an alien under the watchful
05:13 guide of Ridley Scott it was a different
05:15 experience and everything else we had
05:16 ever seen it set the bar higher and the
05:20 bar stayed there forever so there's an
05:23 interesting story about Blade Runner
05:24 because it is based on a novel written
05:27 by philip k dick called do Androids
05:30 Dream of Electric Sheep
05:31 but the story usually stops there for
05:34 people and the most interesting thing is
05:40 the true story of how that became a film
05:44 because philip k dick is a very
05:48 interesting individual I mean almost
05:50 alien to our world in human form he
05:55 wrote about futures that no one could
05:57 conceive of dark futures serious futures
06:01 and he wasn't well as a human being
06:07 sort of he sort of exude the his
06:11 physical prowess he's a big guy he's
06:13 about 63 with sort of that writers humph
06:17 ultra brilliant if you got to know him
06:20 he was sweet if you didn't know him you
06:21 might think he was a jerk that's just
06:23 the rumors full okay dick is on record
06:27 for predicting the future just like
06:29 Nostradamus including having a vision of
06:32 his child having a Tangled contestant
06:36 and he grabs his child literally out of
06:39 his wife's hands says we have to go all
06:40 right now our child's about to die goes
06:42 to the hospital he points out he goes he
06:44 names all the organs in the body that
06:46 are having this problem having never
06:48 gone to med school having never written
06:51 a book that required him to learn that
06:52 Anatomy they did ultrasound on him found
06:57 out it was exactly what Philip had been
06:59 given as a vision they did the surgery
07:02 they told him well your son wasn't an
07:04 imminent danger as in hours and days but
07:09 he was probably an imminent danger as in
07:11 months how on earth did you know this
07:13 was the case and how did you know all
07:14 the medical terms to communicate with us
07:16 and he just said I don't know it just
07:18 came to me so philip k dick to start out
07:22 with is the genesis of this film and it
07:26 is it just keeps getting more amazing
07:29 and more amazing and i happen to be very
07:33 privileged to be in the center of a lot
07:35 of the creativity that made this film
07:37 and so i'm going to share some of that
07:40 with you guys as well just sort of like
07:42 a maybe some Paul Harvey's in there for
07:44 you but a writer named Hampton Fincher
07:49 who I believe also wrote Unforgiven he's
07:54 a that was communicated to me he's a
07:56 stuntman who wanted to become a writer
08:00 and so he found this really cool book
08:02 and he went to philip k dick and he
08:03 optioned the book and I can't read what
08:05 he paid but it was nearly nothing and
08:08 Hilke dick said fine whatever you know I
08:10 know how Hollywood works they're never
08:12 going to be interested in this film just
08:13 so you know so don't get your hopes up
08:15 and this Hampton guy who I've met he
08:20 kept giving scripts to philip k dick
08:23 which is what you do you keep the writer
08:26 informed about how you've evolved it and
08:27 get their input and that kind of stuff
08:29 but then eventually philip k dick sort
08:32 of got annoyed because he likes his
08:34 privacy and he tells hampton you know
08:37 stop bother me kid well WC Fields their
08:42 get away from the kid you bothering me
08:44 and so he does he complies and he
08:47 continues writing the story and
08:49 to his astonishment as the first-time
08:51 writer he gets his script into the right
08:55 hands at the right time
08:56 you know we had Close Encounters Star
08:59 Wars we had just all kinds of neat stuff
09:02 happening alien so in 1980 this thing is
09:05 fully greenlit Ridley Scott is
09:07 interested in directing it and they
09:10 start making this film now I'm going to
09:14 take you down this whole storyline and
09:15 then we'll keep pulling back to the
09:18 beginning though they make the entire
09:21 film and philip k dick gets wind that
09:25 they've made the movie and they're
09:27 calling it Blade Runner which is not his
09:30 name it's not in his book and he's angry
09:35 he's angry that he wasn't informed that
09:37 it was actually greenlit and made into a
09:38 film and he starts doing I guess radio
09:42 interviews television telephone
09:43 interviews with radio stations because
09:45 he's kind of ill he's at home and he
09:47 starts really taking a crap on this film
09:49 telling people they did this behind my
09:51 back don't go see this film just out of
09:53 honour if you like me out of my honour
09:55 don't go see this film and really Scott
09:59 finds out and during the editing process
10:00 in post-production that the founder of
10:03 this story of which he had no idea
10:05 existed is now pisghetti and so really
10:09 is like you know who dropped the ball
10:11 get him in here give him a VIP
10:14 first-class ticket from wherever he
10:16 lives and get him out here so many
10:18 studios were cutting this film up and
10:20 we'll give him a tour the studios will
10:22 show him what we've got and so he does
10:26 philip k dick gets on a plane flies to
10:29 LA i think he was living in texas but
10:32 I'm not quite sure he lands with his
10:34 wife to give him a full tour so many
10:36 studios MGM and he doesn't give a crap
10:38 he doesn't care he comes into the
10:42 screening room where the Scott has 23
10:45 minutes of the film cut together he
10:48 rolls it now Vangelis was the musician
10:52 on the final movie but they didn't have
10:53 any of his original work for the film
10:55 finish so they ran other venge Ellis
10:58 music behind it and it was you know
11:00 breaking here and there I guess for
11:01 dialogue and then some
11:02 the more crazy-cool special flex scenes
11:05 but they get done with this real and
11:09 it's just philip k dick his wife to his
11:12 left and where this got to the right and
11:13 the admins in the back role in the
11:14 projector and the story goes is that he
11:17 turns to ridley scott and he says can we
11:21 do that again he says do what and he
11:24 goes uh can you play it again
11:26 he's like yeah well shared man and play
11:27 it they played all the way through again
11:29 and then phil kaduk turns to ridley
11:33 scott and says how did you do that
11:36 everybody goes do what and he says you
11:40 just created a movie that looked exactly
11:41 the way i saw in my head when i wrote
11:44 the book
11:45 do android Dream of Electric Sheep
11:48 believe it's plural Androids they shake
11:51 hands everything's great there's still
11:54 more editing that needs to be done
11:55 before the film is going to be finished
11:57 and there's obviously a lead time to get
11:58 into the theaters and so it took a
12:00 little while to get the film done
12:01 Feldick a dick goes home and continues
12:04 to suffer whatever illness got him in
12:07 the end he's then admitted to the
12:09 hospital he's taking interviews now as
12:12 fast as he can to undo his damage
12:14 telling people this is going to be one
12:16 of the most amazing movies I've ever
12:18 seen go see it go see it especially if
12:21 you like my books because it's really
12:23 Scott nailed it
12:24 the last known words a philip k dick
12:28 were uttered over the telephone to his
12:30 attorney in his hospital bedroom and he
12:32 said I can't wait to get out of here and
12:36 see Blade Runner it's going to be
12:38 amazing right something to that secured
12:41 son to that effect right hangs up the
12:43 phone and dies in his hospital bed
12:46 obviously there's a chance he saw it
12:49 each assault in the different form but
12:52 the movie comes out and it's starring
12:54 Harrison Ford Harrison Ford is Han Solo
12:56 at the time Harrison Ford is Indiana
12:59 Jones at the time and Harry shows up in
13:02 this obscure science fiction movie right
13:06 for those of you don't know the
13:07 different science Phi is science fantasy
13:10 which is more Star Wars and science
13:12 fiction is very serious based on science
13:14 right supposed to be completely it could
13:17 be a prophecy if you base it on science
13:19 fiction in this film it is dark it is
13:24 wet it's constantly raining there are
13:27 fights there are there's an American
13:31 crew liaison with a British crew Ridley
13:35 Scott when film filming in the UK in
13:39 Europe there's a completely different
13:41 demeanor between the crew and the
13:44 director the director is essentially
13:46 sort of the president of the production
13:49 and you just say yes sir no sir you do
13:52 your thing there's not a lot of hey man
13:54 I had this idea man you know like when
13:56 there's this thing happening that's what
13:58 happened in Hollywood a little more
14:00 versatile so when the two groups came
14:03 together there was sort of this ongoing
14:04 fight between the two of them all kinds
14:08 of funny things were going on but
14:10 initially Harrison Ford hated having
14:16 been in this film because he wasn't
14:17 treated the way he was being treated by
14:20 American sets and I would imagine a lot
14:23 of things happen that are not written
14:24 down any books anywhere that in you know
14:27 we really don't have the right to
14:29 criticize or get it early cast an
14:31 opinion but something didn't jibe
14:32 between arason Ford and really Scott and
14:36 so when I was over he wouldn't take any
14:38 interviews about it wouldn't talk about
14:39 it I was a fan of his due to the other
14:41 franchises and I never heard him talk
14:43 about it and then somewhere in the early
14:46 90s an individual was appropriating a
14:49 bunch of old film reels deciding whether
14:53 or not they should be digitized or not
14:54 at I can't remember probably Warner
14:57 Brothers Studios and he finds a
15:01 director's cut of the original Blade
15:04 Runner that was an extremely nice
15:06 condition and so he elects it to
15:08 obviously be digitized and that's where
15:10 we got the Blade Runner DVD from we're
15:13 going to go back we're going to keep
15:14 coming back so don't worry about missing
15:16 stuff don't worry about it but that was
15:20 when it franchised up and blew up as a
15:23 bonafide cult film outside of the you
15:26 know few tens of thousands of
15:29 that really got into it in the in the
15:31 80s it turned into a hundred thousand
15:33 million person phenomenon in the 90s and
15:36 just kept going and going until the
15:37 point where Warner Brothers said you
15:40 know let's let's talk about a sequel or
15:43 prequel or something let's talk about it
15:45 because this is wild and finally I think
15:47 enough people whispered in our Arison
15:50 Ford's ear something to this effect
15:54 Harrison Blade Runner is the best
15:57 theatrical performance you have ever
15:59 performed it is your best moment on
16:02 camera in your entire career not the
16:05 most necessarily you know exciting
16:09 fanciful it's not you being han Solo and
16:12 kicking ass and taking names it's not
16:13 you being Indiana Jones or kicking ass
16:15 and taking names and all those other
16:16 weird Tom Clancy kind of movies you made
16:19 but this was sophisticated and you
16:22 pulled it off you pulled off a character
16:23 that was in a weird world and we
16:26 believed it from start to finish and you
16:28 do you person kills this role I always
16:33 say kill people say nail kill usually
16:35 might mean bad but none this is not bad
16:37 maybe bad but bad meaning good and so in
16:41 the last five years we've seen a reamer
16:44 gence of Harrison Ford and respect to
16:47 Blade Runner and he's finally talking
16:48 about it now here this year we're going
16:51 to get the sequel and you know dear God
16:55 I hope it's good I hope it's good that
16:57 the inside rumors are that it's a
16:59 fabulous script and I can definitely
17:01 tell you having purchased the original
17:04 script that Hampton Fincher and another
17:07 guy finished off the beginning of the
17:11 trailer looks like a beginning of the
17:13 actual original script which never was
17:15 actually created because it was going to
17:17 cost too much money so let's hope that
17:21 the sequel is pretty good but now let's
17:24 rewind back to the beginning what you
17:27 may or may not know is that this film
17:28 went through an unbelievable challenge
17:31 to be funded this film went bankrupt
17:37 essentially twice
17:39 causing it to split into three pieces
17:42 right you take a ribbon and you chop it
17:44 in two places you get three pieces right
17:46 so it was initially green with green lit
17:49 for ten million dollars which is really
17:52 pathetic because Ridley Scott had just
17:54 directed a lien which made about a
17:56 hundred and ten million dollars in the
17:59 end domestically as I understand it
18:00 which back in 1979 was huge money was
18:05 some Star Wars money but it was enough
18:07 that wasn't anything to sneeze at so he
18:09 gets ten million and because of the
18:12 fabrication that was necessary to make
18:15 the world happen they got through that
18:17 really quick they're not hiring crappy
18:19 actors instead of spending tons of money
18:20 and so they have to go get more money
18:24 and once they got more money they had to
18:25 change production companies it actually
18:28 had to change the lot of which they were
18:30 filming because of the change in the
18:33 funding then it went bankrupt again at
18:35 20 million had to borrow another ten
18:39 million and this time they had to borrow
18:40 outside of the paradigm of filmmaking if
18:43 you ever watch the Blade Runner you'll
18:45 see this really cool logo of this
18:47 digitized tree like a mustard tree or
18:49 something and so I should probably be
18:52 name of the trees below gone camera what
18:54 the hell the name of the company is but
18:55 it was a company just of some investors
18:57 who are probably some of the luckiest
19:00 people on planet earth because they did
19:02 invest in Blade Runner and they finally
19:06 finished up the film but over the course
19:09 of all this ups and downs you actually
19:11 have a situation that happened to Steven
19:13 Steven Spielberg during the filming of
19:15 Close Encounters of the Third Kind that
19:17 Ridley Scott got actually fired
19:20 technically speaking on paper some of
19:24 you may not know but Steven Spielberg
19:26 was fired off of Close Encounters while
19:28 filming the devil's tower segments and
19:30 he just both of them did the same thing
19:32 they just kept coming to work so one of
19:35 the nightmares on paper when it came to
19:39 distributing the film was trying to
19:42 divide up all the dollars and cents
19:44 from these companies that go belly-up to
19:48 different Studios that were huge
19:49 participated in screwin wanting their
19:51 percentage and who knows what
19:52 percentages were so I would say that the
19:55 executive producers on Blade Runner
19:57 really did their job and I've met
20:01 several of them and I've acquaintances
20:03 with a lot of them but they're amazing
20:06 people that kept pursuing this thing
20:08 through just rewind back the beginning
20:13 labor burner looks different than all
20:15 science fiction films made - made up
20:18 until 1982 and it could be credited to a
20:23 very good friend of mine that I've
20:24 worked for for 20 years his name is Syd
20:27 Mead sy d npad just go to Syd Mead comm
20:34 you can take a look at some of his wares
20:37 there he's still a working artist so
20:39 there's not like a greatest hits on that
20:41 website and he still does movies all the
20:45 time and I can't say anything else about
20:50 that he's working he's a working artist
20:54 but Syd was introduced to Ridley Scott
20:59 by another very very close friend of
21:01 mine Richard Taylor from Tron and this
21:05 is a very interesting story which I do
21:06 not believe is in the future new war
21:08 book I have the inside scoop so you get
21:11 the inside scoop and this is augo's so
21:13 Richard Taylor is working on Tron the
21:17 1982 release of Tron and again they have
21:19 very similar green light dates and
21:22 release dates so you have 1982 is when
21:26 Tron released in August and Blade Runner
21:28 released in Christmas and trauma
21:31 supposed to release in Christmas so it's
21:32 probably a good thing that they got
21:34 separated from each other the richard
21:37 taylor is sitting in his studio working
21:39 on front I'm Richard Taylor there's two
21:42 mature Taylor's that are big special
21:44 effects guys one works for Wetty
21:46 for Peter Jackson and he's younger and
21:49 the other one is older my buddy and he
21:53 was the one that actually invented the
21:56 striped line look in Tron so that hole
21:59 lit line thing which he invented at a
22:02 place called Abel's and associates he
22:04 called a candy apple red
22:06 when he invented it using a bunch of
22:07 rear-projection technology but when
22:10 Steven lists Berger went to Richard
22:12 Taylor and said I'm not sure what this
22:14 thing should look like we're making
22:15 inside of a computer and nobody even has
22:17 computers in our homes yet so what
22:19 should it look like and he goes hey I
22:20 got an idea and so they figured out how
22:23 to do the Tron look which is now in your
22:25 car's right my car looks like a Tron
22:28 world inside because it's all pinstriped
22:31 and I can change the color of the
22:32 pinstripes and nine different colors in
22:34 my car I'll do to the guy who sits in it
22:37 every once in a while which is pretty
22:38 cool but there's a point and I'm not
22:43 quite sure how this happens but you have
22:45 a point where Ridley Scott was coming
22:48 down the hallway and ends up sitting
22:50 with Richard Taylor at his office and he
22:53 is trying to figure out who can design
22:56 Blade Runner because he has all these
22:58 things that he needs to do and the very
23:00 first thing he needs to get designed our
23:02 the cars and Syd Mead is said made has
23:05 been a prodigy I'll probably do a whole
23:07 episode on set at one point but he has
23:09 been a prodigy since he was a child in
23:11 terms of illustration he went to Art
23:13 Center designed for Ford and Phillips
23:16 and he broke out on his own did the US
23:18 Steel series and then he got into film
23:20 with Star Trek which Richard insted bump
23:24 shoulders and Star Trek the first film
23:25 motion picture 1979 but really sitting
23:29 there with Richard and he goes you know
23:32 I don't know what to make this world I
23:33 got to make these cars right away and so
23:35 Richard says have you heard of Sid meet
23:38 he was no who's that he's got his US
23:41 Steel series which what it was his US
23:43 Steel company which still exists to this
23:45 day hired said to do beautiful fantasy
23:47 renderings of where you could use steel
23:50 and so Sid would design all kinds of
23:53 homes and cars in fact the at-at walkers
23:55 that are in Empire Strikes Back or
23:57 actually lifted from a painting in 1962
24:01 by Sid for the US Steel and he didn't
24:05 have the top part of it figured out but
24:07 he had the legs in the snow and it's
24:09 just when you see the fringe ring by Sid
24:11 you'll go oh my god
24:13 you know this came from the same dude
24:17 but he hands really a couple of his US
24:19 Steel books and really left and said got
24:24 a phone call now Sid was already hired
24:26 and working on Tron sharing the task
24:29 with Mobius so Tron gets created by Sid
24:34 bead in 50% capacity and in intron said
24:38 did the tanks the light cycles he did
24:44 the circuitry design or Mobius did more
24:47 of the body design Mobius did the solar
24:49 sailer I think a different group did the
24:53 recognizer but once you see you know the
24:56 tank and Tron one back in 82 your jaws
24:59 on the ground how amazing this thing of
25:00 course it was rendered by some
25:02 unbelievable artists at three different
25:05 studios back in the day so there's a
25:06 whole bunch of people participating in
25:07 that but Sid was the genesis and when
25:11 Tron Legacy was made in 2010 the
25:13 original design that said had for the
25:15 bikes and the light cycles was more like
25:18 the 2010 one than the one you saw in 82
25:20 but the software and 82 could do it it
25:23 couldn't make the guy's body blend in
25:25 with the bike so if you see the original
25:28 sketch that Sid did back in 81 you'll
25:31 see the huge resemblance with Legacy
25:34 except says I think is a little cooler
25:36 in some respects a BMW designed the
25:40 light cycles in Legacy which is why
25:44 they're so freakin cool they went back
25:46 to Blade Runner one of the funny stories
25:49 was that Richard never got back his US
25:52 Steel books and because they are so rare
25:55 and they're so limited edition and
25:58 people fight to get them even to this
26:00 day and it was really strange if you go
26:02 to flea markets in big cities sometimes
26:04 you'll find these books being sold for
26:07 five ten dollars and they're worth
26:09 hundreds of dollars so for those of you
26:12 are collectors you might add that to
26:14 your list of very special things but Sid
26:18 gets hired to do the cars and every
26:20 single vehicle that you see that's a
26:22 space-age vehicle like the spinner the
26:24 cop car Deckard's cop car and a few of
26:27 the other ambient cars that are in
26:28 traffic
26:30 built by jean Winfield those are all
26:35 SIDS but then what Sid was doing is Sid
26:38 doesn't just create an image of a
26:40 product so if you said hey I want you to
26:42 design a saltshaker Sid won't just do
26:44 the saltshaker he puts it on a table he
26:46 puts about a picnic he puts in some
26:48 futuristic picnic he designed something
26:50 cool on the wall the clothing is all new
26:52 the tables strange and designed so he
26:56 starts turning in paintings of these of
26:57 these vehicles with these exteriors
27:03 futuristic exteriors and really Scott's
27:07 like well where did you get the
27:09 direction to do the buildings and you
27:11 said nothing that no one told me I just
27:13 I do scenario I don't do products I make
27:16 a scenario in a painting this
27:18 composition there's action here's a
27:20 storyline and it really goes ok this
27:24 looks perfect why don't you start doing
27:27 everything with the clothing the guns
27:30 the interiors of buildings the exterior
27:34 of the buildings so he did like jf
27:35 Sebastian's interior Sid's original
27:38 sketch of Sebastian's laboratory was
27:41 simply too expensive to create but it
27:43 was it would have made the movie even
27:45 more intense even though there's no real
27:47 flaws and Blade Runner for the time
27:50 Sid's always outpacing what the studio's
27:52 can afford usually so we have this
27:56 Genesis this this amazing set of
27:59 circumstances that kicks this film off
28:01 Hampton Fincher you know stunt man goes
28:05 and grabs a book license it writes for
28:07 about five years is in the right place
28:08 at the right time Ridley Scott gets and
28:10 gets hired Sid gets in gets hired you
28:13 know Phil okay dick is angry then he
28:15 sees it and he's completely convinced
28:18 it's the most amazing thing he's ever
28:19 seen but this the gentleman who wrote
28:22 this book future new are the making of
28:25 Blade Runner by Paul Sam on he he was
28:31 hired at the very beginning of this
28:32 process to document the creation of this
28:35 movie and in my entire history of
28:39 listening to you know my buddy is making
28:42 their films
28:43 very few Studios I've ever had enough
28:45 insight to hire someone to do such a
28:46 thing
28:47 and so this book is utterly packed with
28:50 all the secrets all the wild craziness
28:53 that went on the disputes and all that
28:55 kind of stuff right but why is Blade
28:58 Runner special well if you're a fan of
29:02 old gumshoe detective movies from the
29:04 30s there's this crazy similarity
29:07 between that which is usually filmed you
29:10 are right you know film noir comes from
29:12 a French sort of stylistic method making
29:15 films when we brought it over here you
29:16 have Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney
29:18 making films and so there's this private
29:22 detective
29:23 who's our guy played by Harrison Ford
29:25 his name's Deckard who was named after
29:28 decart the philosopher and he is
29:33 approached at the beginning of this film
29:37 to handle a case of some replicants
29:42 which are what they call androids who
29:45 are perfectly lifelike perfectly human
29:47 like who have escaped from a mining
29:50 colony and come back to earth for an
29:55 unknown reason there was five of them
29:58 originally one of them gets fried up in
30:00 a security gate and then you have four
30:02 left two girls and two boys you have a
30:07 few famous actors in this film right
30:09 you've got Rutger Hauer playing Roy you
30:12 have Daryl Hannah playing pris you have
30:15 Sean Young playing one of the assistants
30:17 to dr. Tyrell who's the main guy that
30:19 designs all of these Androids
30:24 you have edward james olmos point gasps
30:27 ever you know James almost just blew up
30:30 after this whole thing right an actor
30:34 named Brian James who was actually also
30:36 in the fifth element who just before the
30:39 filming of the of his first scene which
30:41 is an interview at the Tyrell
30:42 corporation he had gotten into a major
30:44 motorcycle accident and very serious and
30:48 his face is all scraped up from the
30:50 motorcycle accident so they just left it
30:52 in the film because he
30:55 works at the Tyrell corporation and you
30:57 know they just kind of busted out of
30:59 this mining colony and come back to came
31:01 back to earth and killed a few guards
31:02 and so they just kind of left it in and
31:04 it were completely William Sanderson who
31:08 you have seen in in the TV series coach
31:11 but he was in Deadwood as EB Farnum he
31:15 you know
31:16 just exploded off this office movie
31:19 right the very famous James Hong who
31:24 plays Chu who's a an expert that makes
31:27 eyes which is really cool
31:30 Joe Terkel who was the bartender in the
31:33 shining with Stanley Kubrick ends up
31:35 being dr. Tyrell and he's just one of
31:38 the most debonair amazing guys he'll
31:40 ever see and he's still alive to this
31:42 day joanna cassidy who I've actually met
31:46 at one of the Warner Brothers gatherings
31:47 she plays Zora who's one of the super
31:53 badass battlebot chicks which is really
31:55 cool and again they all look normal
31:56 human right so you have this incredible
31:59 staff and everyone every other person in
32:01 the film is is phenomenal as well
32:03 there's no bad acting in the entire film
32:06 so you already have this sort of match
32:09 made in heaven with the formula of the
32:11 casting there's another historical thing
32:13 about this film that a lot of people
32:15 don't know about and that is that the
32:17 studio's such as Warner Brothers
32:19 paramount and all the people that come
32:21 together to make films happen at the
32:23 time we're at the peak of their skill
32:24 sets really Scott was at the peak of the
32:28 skill set people who made movies back in
32:31 those days actually had worked together
32:32 for 10 20 30 years and so when they
32:35 wanted to get a concept about what
32:37 needed to happen when really is trying
32:39 to tell someone what he's seeing in his
32:41 head the staff was a lot more equipped
32:43 back in those days to get get his vision
32:46 out because everyone worked together
32:48 they could intercommunicate really
32:50 really well today everything is a
32:52 consulting firm consulting firm so you
32:54 have studios that have kicked everyone
32:56 out of the studios and they make them
32:57 all consult in meaning every film is
32:59 created today is a hodgepodge of folks
33:01 that have maybe work together maybe not
33:03 work together maybe they like each other
33:05 maybe they don't like each other and so
33:07 it's always this
33:09 balancing game when you build your crew
33:11 today the back in the day you would
33:13 carry your crew with you from a major
33:15 studio because you would have signed a
33:16 contract with Warner Brothers or sign a
33:19 contract with someone and you would
33:21 carry this family with you Stanley
33:23 Kubrick who remained independent his
33:25 whole life had built a crew I think by
33:28 the time a Clockwork Orange was made he
33:33 finally found the staff that he liked
33:34 because 2001 was a definite hodgepodge
33:39 of all kinds of folks coming together to
33:41 make an amazing film right so the
33:45 quality of the film has that going
33:47 forward now let's talk about some of the
33:52 stylistic treatments that were the
33:55 foundation of the film that had never
33:57 been really done before that film and
34:00 you might cite some bizarre film but
34:02 this is where it really came together
34:04 and was executed at an A+ level right
34:07 100% plus extra credit you have a dark
34:12 future at most we had the rebel force in
34:16 Star Wars up to that point where they
34:19 you know had had the intelligence to say
34:22 if it's a rebel force they don't have
34:24 all the resources and they're not going
34:26 to have fresh paint jobs and fresh
34:28 equipment and they're not going to have
34:30 giant mother ships and bases all
34:32 polished and so that was the first kind
34:34 of step in that direction but philip k
34:36 dick had been writing what you see in
34:38 Blade Runner for at least 20 years prior
34:43 again this dude was seeing a future that
34:45 we just weren't seeing and it's Los
34:49 Angeles 2019 again their movie was
34:51 released in 1982 I think the only bummer
34:54 that they did when they remastered it
34:56 was not to they should have added an
34:57 extra hundred years and then it really
34:59 would have been interesting to the young
35:01 kids so any young kid who plays the
35:02 movie that's going to happen in two
35:03 years from today 2017 to 2019 you got
35:07 already seems hokey and ridiculous so
35:10 they should have flipped it up 2119 but
35:12 anyway so 2019 Los Angeles area and Los
35:15 Angeles has turned into the refinery
35:17 that we have here in Carson which is a
35:20 big oil refinery every time I draw the
35:21 405 down
35:23 on friends trying to tell them where I
35:24 am always say yeah I'm at the
35:25 Bladerunner you know and I'm at Los
35:29 Angeles 2019 but it's raining with this
35:33 insinuation that the world has become so
35:37 polluted that it just rains all the time
35:38 and it for whatever reason is dark all
35:41 the time too the world is largely the
35:44 same in terms of you got people and you
35:46 got police officers and it just kind of
35:49 goes right people in corporations that
35:52 make a tremendous amount of money like
35:54 the Tyrell corporation which is this
35:56 gigantic pyramid structure it said
35:59 designed which is the headquarters and
36:02 one of the things that people miss all
36:04 the time about the design of the Tyrell
36:06 corporation is that there's these these
36:08 giant side buildings that are at a giant
36:11 tilt and they're not falling over and so
36:14 the the big statement to an architect
36:17 you see is the film is oh my god that at
36:19 that building is three-quarters of a
36:20 mile high and it's not falling over and
36:24 it's not quite that tall but it's really
36:25 really really massive I think the
36:28 original scale was about a mile high but
36:30 they realized it would start touching
36:31 clouds respectively so they pulled it
36:33 back but its massive the world is kind
36:37 of messed itself up and so most people
36:40 that can afford it will go offworld
36:42 they'll live in different places and
36:44 they never really get into what that
36:46 means they don't get into you know
36:48 Planet Zeon or whatever they don't see
36:50 anything they just say offworld which is
36:52 really nice and so the people who are
36:56 left behind or people either like earth
36:58 the way it is or they're they lack the
37:00 resources or education or they have
37:02 health problems to lead the planet
37:05 towards the end of the film in terms of
37:08 cinematic kind of nuances that are
37:10 interesting is that you have a lot of
37:12 volumetric lighting which means you drop
37:15 a bunch of fog in a room and you blast a
37:17 light through a couple things about that
37:20 you see that effect all the time today
37:22 but before Blade Runner you rarely see
37:25 that effect at all in any film at all in
37:28 history until you go back to the 30s
37:31 when you start getting some Casablanca
37:33 you know third-act scenes
37:36 the other Paul Harvey about the smoke
37:39 was that the smoke that they used back
37:40 in Hollywood in 82 82 was a very
37:45 poisonous smoke you weren't supposed to
37:48 really inhale it much but all these
37:50 actors and you know people once that
37:52 were inhaling this stuff constantly and
37:54 it was part of the complaints from the
37:56 cast and crew that you know can we lay
37:59 off this smoke because it's making
38:01 everybody sick and of course Rudy said
38:03 no it's part of the story the other
38:08 beautiful thing about Blade Runner is
38:10 that you have a film with no special
38:13 effects the only thing you have are
38:18 inlet in optical printing effects which
38:20 is where we take a bunch of different
38:23 film layers and expose them on top of
38:26 each other to create a single shot so
38:28 for instance for any of you've seen the
38:30 film and you see the initial scene where
38:32 Deckard is being taken to the police
38:34 station at the beginning by gaff he's
38:37 looking out the window and we know we're
38:38 getting these incredible shots so the
38:40 lens flares all of the reflections on
38:43 the glass of the spinner is all been
38:45 added after the fact so he filmed it
38:48 perfectly with no glass and then they
38:50 added all these special effects to give
38:51 you the sense that he was traveling if
38:54 you look at it and you look at how
38:56 utterly seamless and beautiful it is
38:58 you're not losing contrast all this all
39:01 the usual flubs that you have when say
39:04 George Lucas try to put you know 200 TIE
39:06 fighters flying around you see the mats
39:08 chasing them you know did it probably
39:13 one of the most incredible jobs putting
39:16 this film together in terms of optical
39:18 effects it's just phenomenal what the
39:22 film stands up overtime you can watch
39:24 the old film and it doesn't feel like
39:26 you're looking at a relic you know
39:29 there's a when the spenders take off you
39:31 get a bit of a sense of the they try to
39:34 blow smoke out of the bottom of the do
39:35 blow smoke out of the bottom of the
39:36 spinner kind of indicating our
39:38 propulsion system and you know there's
39:40 something about it just isn't enough
39:41 smoke to really cause any lift you just
39:44 can't you don't see me thrust but that's
39:46 really the only place where you really
39:48 see anything that was strange
39:49 there's a couple makeup flubs that were
39:51 fixed in the copies of the film that
39:53 you'll get today but going back to the
39:56 beginning one more time when you
39:59 initially watch the film in 1982 in the
40:01 movie theater you have Harrison Ford is
40:03 narrating it here and there it's really
40:07 heavy narration at the beginning Luce
40:10 narration in the middle and heavy
40:12 narration at the end with an extra scene
40:14 at the end that has now been clipped
40:16 from the director's cut release god did
40:20 not want to have Harrison Ford narrating
40:22 this film narration to a director means
40:25 that you've done such a poor job telling
40:26 the story visually that you have to
40:29 explain it to the audience and I was
40:32 about 12 years old I guess I was 13 when
40:34 the film came out so you know helped me
40:37 as a kid I don't know if I would have
40:39 gotten it without the narration because
40:41 I never had a chance the end of the film
40:44 is actually very interesting and again
40:46 if you guys watch the the making of in
40:49 the DVD collection a lot of this is just
40:51 to repeat with a few things that I might
40:53 know that you don't but most 95% of it
40:56 you're going to know because you've
40:57 watched it on the on the suitcase
40:59 selection or collection excuse me but
41:03 when they saw the last scene the last
41:05 scene that Ridley Scott filmed was
41:07 Deckard closing the elevator at the end
41:08 and again if you haven't seen it we'll
41:10 get to that briefly here because I'm
41:13 just going to give you the the footnotes
41:14 of the actual film in closing this
41:17 episode to give you the kind of trailer
41:19 of why you should see the regional
41:22 regional film again it is so revered in
41:25 Hollywood by everyone in the business no
41:28 matter what discipline you're in special
41:30 effects directing cinematography acting
41:33 whatever that you should see it if you
41:35 like films and if you like that genre
41:38 there's nothing scary about it that
41:40 you're going to have bad dreams or
41:41 anything like that
41:44 mr. scared of rain but the studio's had
41:50 Final Cut and that means that the
41:52 director could decide when it was done
41:54 and if they wanted a change he had to do
41:56 it otherwise they would release the film
41:58 or they'd take it and cut it themselves
42:00 that's the last thing you want to do
42:01 what the
42:04 in contrast Kubrick always had final cut
42:07 because he was such an artist and he had
42:09 so much juice maybe would say you don't
42:12 get to distribute my film unless you
42:14 agreed to me having the final cut that's
42:17 how powerful that guy was which is why
42:19 he again was very unique but at the very
42:24 end the studio said you got to put
42:26 something else on the end there needs a
42:27 happy ending and uplifting ending
42:29 Deckard gets to leave with his woman
42:32 played by Sean Young Rachel is the
42:36 fictitious character's name and so he he
42:40 was like what am I going to do he goes
42:42 well why don't you make a shot where
42:43 they kind of get away in a car they
42:45 leave the dark city and for the very
42:46 first time they see wilderness and maybe
42:49 some snowy ice caps and that kind of
42:51 stuff and really is already going off I
42:54 think he believed he was filming legend
42:56 at the time setting up all the
42:57 pre-production for that he's like I
42:58 don't have time to come back to America
43:00 and shoot something so we can do a
43:03 little bit of gonna be roll footage in
43:07 all film Harrison Ford and Sean Young
43:10 inside a car and it will just try to
43:12 fledge something together so the
43:13 interesting thing was is that Harrison
43:17 excuse me
43:18 Ridley Scott actually contacted Kubrick
43:20 and he said you know I heard that your
43:22 wife shot all the b-roll for the shining
43:25 and the little yellow Volkswagen the
43:27 lemon was going up the hill towards the
43:31 Overlook Hotel do you have any of that
43:33 footage that you didn't use and Kubrick
43:36 was noted as saying yeah I got about 30
43:39 feet that I never used you can have it
43:42 I'll have it sent over to you and so
43:44 when you see the original Blade Runner
43:47 last scene which again you probably look
43:49 it up on YouTube you're looking at the
43:51 shining with this futuristic car that
43:55 said designed which was never really
43:57 designed for broad daylight exposure so
43:59 it looks a little funky in broad
44:01 daylight but that's all we had you know
44:04 but that was eventually clipped from the
44:07 end of the film to leave it the way it
44:08 was originally created which is cool now
44:11 one of the notes that
44:13 so sid i want to give like a sid common
44:16 here so Sid had done
44:19 Star Trek one he did Tron one now he did
44:23 Blade Runner he did the robot and short
44:25 circuit he did some of the pod designs
44:28 and aliens the sequel to alien and he's
44:33 just done tons and tons of stuff Elysium
44:35 and Tomorrowland and he doesn't write
44:38 the scripts he just does the designs but
44:41 he's very very famous for Blade Runner
44:44 and people come up to him all the time
44:46 and ask him you know what is the most
44:48 coveted thing you've ever done in your
44:50 life because you've done so much and he
44:52 says well obviously I love all the films
44:55 I've worked on but he said you know
44:57 Blade Runner was probably the most fun
44:58 because I had the most control over what
45:01 was being put into the film and he does
45:03 the fabrication people just built
45:05 exactly what I designed it was there's
45:07 no question about it being realized now
45:10 he did design a gun for Deckard that
45:12 wasn't actually used I think the one
45:13 they pick was actually better but that's
45:15 a very rare occurrence since his design
45:17 history but sitting was Sid and talking
45:21 to him several times about this over the
45:22 years his big thing is he goes you know
45:26 I designed the future so that people can
45:28 see a positive potential for themselves
45:30 I don't design things that are dark
45:34 because I don't want that that future to
45:36 exist but he goes Blade Runner is this
45:39 weird sort of catch-22 and that one of
45:42 the most entertaining things I've ever
45:44 designed was a dark future and so just
45:48 know that even though it is a very dark
45:50 film dictated by the original book
45:52 turned script he gets Hampton Fancher
45:55 not Fincher that's his opinion about
45:58 what he did there so let's get into the
46:02 footnotes of the script in case you've
46:05 never seen this film before the film
46:08 starts out with a narration explaining
46:10 to you the world you're about to enter
46:13 telling you that the world had actually
46:15 developed these things called replicants
46:16 and when they are killed they call it
46:20 retirement but in order to make sure
46:24 that these androids that keep getting
46:26 better and better and better they have
46:27 versions which are called Nexus so they
46:31 using the word version you use the word
46:33 Nexus so Nexus 1 2 3 so I believe we're
46:37 dealing with the Nexus 6 series and they
46:41 are indistinguishable with humans and
46:44 they've been given something that philip
46:47 k dick invented which is the notion of
46:50 memories and again you see this all the
46:53 time in movies now ok but the idea that
46:56 you would give a robot memories such
46:59 that it would be more stable as a being
47:03 was really a Phil ok dick invention as
47:06 far as I know and there's there I think
47:09 Earl Hammer wrote the one for Twilight
47:11 Zone called during the body electric but
47:14 it was based off of Lincoln x -1 script
47:17 which phil key dick wrote a phil k dick
47:20 was a short story writer in the 50s and
47:22 60s and so i think it came from him
47:25 please correct me if I'm wrong and I
47:27 apologize but I just saw some horror
47:31 movie the other day of my smoke shop it
47:33 was just an utter I was a Bruce Willis
47:35 film it was just the saddest attempt to
47:38 copy Blade Runner you've ever seen in
47:39 your [ __ ] life
47:40 unbelievable and I like Bruce Willis too
47:44 but the film starts out with our hero
47:47 reading a newspaper against some you
47:49 know neon lit television shop and across
47:54 the way he's waiting it's raining like
47:56 crazy he's waiting for a seat to come
47:57 open in the sushi bar that's across the
47:59 way and the interesting thing about the
48:01 sushi bar is that Americans really
48:02 didn't know what sushi was except for
48:03 maybe in the huge cities and so a lot of
48:07 us learned about sushi by watching Blade
48:09 Runner for the first scene that's all
48:10 you know all you ever see but he goes
48:13 over and he sits down he orders a couple
48:15 servings of sushi and then James Olmos
48:18 comes behind him dressed in the wildest
48:21 looking outfits you've ever seen just
48:23 but it's conservative but it's cool and
48:26 he's all fan and young and he starts
48:29 speaking in I think it's called City
48:31 speak and she kind of understand few
48:34 words here and there and he's telling
48:35 them
48:36 now I want your attention and you need
48:38 to come with me right now because sort
48:40 of the the Chief of Police wants to see
48:44 him Brian he tries to resist but then
48:49 the guy says I know you're a Blade
48:50 Runner you got to come with me right now
48:52 and blade runners are the agents that go
48:55 out retire replicates but you can look
48:58 at Harrison Ford and kind of go well he
48:59 must have been doing this for a couple
49:00 you know decades at least because it
49:03 probably at least a decade because he's
49:05 in his like mid-30s at the time but you
49:07 know with Harrison Ford his
49:08 sophistication you can't quite lock him
49:10 down because his maturity that he plays
49:12 kid aged him another ten years even
49:14 though it looks good and so he's kind of
49:18 forced into this police car the spinner
49:20 it takes off there's a whole group of
49:22 spinners and they're going into this
49:23 world so now we get this huge Vista of
49:25 him going to the police precinct where
49:29 he then barges in the door which is at
49:31 the LA train station downtown we've kind
49:34 of made a little room for him and he
49:37 essentially gets read the right acted
49:39 what I call for you you have to come
49:41 because if you don't participate in
49:45 getting rid of these replicants then
49:48 you're sort of little people and little
49:50 people can get hurt
49:51 but if you remain part of our team you
49:54 get privileges sorta it's all in
49:56 backhanded beautiful metaphorical
49:58 dialogue so then he agrees to help
50:02 because he's kind of being forced to do
50:04 it he gets inside this briefing room
50:05 where he's being shown videos of
50:07 everyone that escaped and survived which
50:10 are the four characters that I mentioned
50:12 Leon Roy pris and Zora all of them are
50:18 pretty much battle bots except for pris
50:19 which is Daryl Hannah's one of her first
50:22 big roles ever which is really cool and
50:25 to the credit of the actors you know you
50:29 don't know you make a cult film until it
50:31 becomes a cult film and the whole the
50:34 whole arc of a cult film in most cases
50:36 is it takes about a decade to become a
50:38 cult film it doesn't usually blow up
50:40 like the Rocky Horror Picture Show which
50:42 just was made and immediately blew up as
50:44 this thing that everybody worships right
50:48 the only reason I say that is if you
50:50 ever hear criticism or I get frustrated
50:52 with how fast they adopted their roles
50:54 it that's why you know but then the
50:57 movie just starts out where he is going
50:59 out and collecting facts about things
51:01 collecting going to crime scenes
51:04 actually I think I just got ahead of
51:06 myself there there's actually one scene
51:08 before this what just happened happened
51:10 which is an interview with one of the
51:12 replicants Leon comes in and he's being
51:17 interviewed by a Blade Runner at the
51:19 Tyrell corporation because they think
51:21 that these folks would maybe try to go
51:23 back and go to the company that they
51:26 were made and try to get themselves
51:27 fixed because they have four year
51:28 lifespans and sure enough they find one
51:32 and this cop named Holden played by a
51:35 brilliant actor does an interview and
51:38 the interview revolves this machine this
51:41 machine that Sid designed called the
51:42 void comp machine which is to study the
51:45 reaction of the pupil during certain
51:47 emotional responses in relation to
51:51 questions that a replicant may not know
51:53 how to answer because as smart as they
51:55 are they don't have world they don't
51:57 really have all the memories that are
51:58 the beautiful three-dimensional history
52:00 of the whole thing and during the
52:02 questioning it gets to a point where
52:04 Leon basically loses a [ __ ] and blows
52:06 away Holden under a table with this gun
52:09 that's about looks like a little tiny
52:11 gun that a woman might carry in her
52:12 purse I guess about four barrels but the
52:15 impact is pretty much a 50 caliber round
52:19 or something man it's it's massive then
52:23 we flashed the scene I just told you it
52:24 goes to the Pleader precinct there's a
52:27 bit of a he says you know why don't you
52:29 put Holden on this on this case and he
52:32 says well you know he'll be okay as long
52:35 as I don't unplug him basically meaning
52:38 I sent him over he found one and he got
52:40 hurt so you've pretty much heard the
52:44 setup the alt that is going to cover
52:47 everything that you need to see the rest
52:49 of the film is Harrison for going out
52:52 and finding these four people he also
52:54 goes to the Tyrell corporation ends up
52:57 meeting dr. Tyrell the inventor the one
52:59 that designs the brains one of the
53:01 designed the overall architecture of the
53:04 Nexus line and he befriends Shan Young's
53:09 character who's Rachel he starts to fall
53:12 in love with her so he's trying to chase
53:15 these four people that at first he's
53:18 looking for them and then he finds out
53:19 they're looking for him that sounds like
53:23 a repeat but it's not first he's looking
53:25 for them and he finds out they are
53:27 looking for him right and you start
53:30 learning about the fabric of this world
53:32 through experience and the jf Sebastian
53:34 character played by Sanderson ends up by
53:38 staking Lee serendipitously were
53:39 friending pris but he's also one of the
53:43 engineers at the Tyrell corporation so
53:45 what the replicants try to do is go
53:47 after all the employees to find one
53:49 employee that can get them to dr. Tyrell
53:52 because they want to be saved they want
53:54 their for your lifespan to be undone
53:57 I'll just let you watch the film to find
53:59 out what happens there but there's a
54:01 point where the humans start wondering
54:05 am i real or am i replicant and in the
54:10 most kind of amazing turn of events in
54:15 this particular film's history is that
54:19 from the point the film released in 1982
54:21 the point the film was remastered by
54:23 Ridley Scott himself with fixes that you
54:28 actually went in and and fixed a few
54:29 scenes where a stunt actress had to
54:33 actually play a character at one point
54:36 falling through some glass and the
54:37 makeup on her was really bad she didn't
54:40 look like the actress and so they
54:42 actually got back the actress in the
54:45 21st century here and put dressed her up
54:49 like she was and had her fall through
54:51 the glass again now she's still she's 20
54:53 years older she's gorgeous so you can
54:55 barely tell and really just did a
54:57 beautiful job he put the all this
54:58 together and they read it into the film
55:00 and fix this one spot in the film where
55:02 didn't look right and there's a few
55:04 little vignette scenes as well I think
55:06 they pulled off the director's cut and
55:08 just stuck in there so we those of us
55:10 who've seen the film hundreds of times
55:13 we'll see those new little vignettes and
55:16 it's just beautiful but he did something
55:18 that no one has ever done to my
55:19 knowledge which is he changed the movie
55:22 in a really big way and if you haven't
55:28 seen the film I mean most of you know
55:29 exactly what I'm talking about for those
55:31 of you who are into it but there's a
55:35 trying to spoil it for you he went off
55:40 and fell in the movie legend with
55:42 legends or love didn't what ever was
55:44 with Tom Cruise and the gentleman from
55:49 Rocky Horror Picture Show Curry Tim
55:51 Curry and he took a scene from that film
55:56 and inserted it into Blade Runner 25
56:01 years later 30 years later think about
56:04 25 years later and it changed what the
56:06 film meant at the end and I'll let you
56:12 find out what that is so there's no
56:14 spoilers in this whole thing I'm just
56:16 basically giving you a glorified trailer
56:18 with some of the sort of the reasons why
56:21 this film is so revered among the people
56:24 in Hollywood I had the privilege of
56:26 going to several screenings with Sid and
56:30 the whole gang and going to you know
56:33 some talks with Ridley and that kind of
56:34 stuff because of my practice my my
56:36 working for Sid for years and the people
56:39 behind this film are utterly passionate
56:42 about its creation and I will tell you
56:45 that of all the films that have made
56:46 kind of cinematic history this
56:49 particular film has a family behind it
56:52 that really care about it persisting and
56:56 being polished and you know they
56:58 remastered in up-res the original
57:00 negative so I thought in this incredible
57:03 theater that some of you probably been -
57:06 and Warner Brothers a lot and here in
57:07 Hollywood but it just looked phenomenal
57:10 you know but even the DVD crew that that
57:17 took care of the suitcase addition that
57:20 you might see out there you know they
57:24 treated the film like it was their foam
57:26 and so the love that was put into this
57:28 thing was really unique I think in
57:32 history and they know fans do
57:33 participate in the recreation of things
57:35 you know Doctor Who is probably one of
57:38 the other series on TV where you know
57:44 the fans resurrected some of the
57:46 episodes back in the 60s that were lost
57:47 using flash animation and audio tapes
57:50 that they got off the TVs and just
57:53 tremendous some of the followings that
57:55 we have out there now a couple little
57:59 things that might be interesting now
58:01 some of you know this again if your
58:02 diehard Blade Runner fans there's only a
58:05 couple things I've told you that you may
58:06 not know the very final scene at the
58:11 very final scene that sounds horrible
58:12 the final scene is between Rutger Hauer
58:15 and Harrison Ford which is Roy and
58:17 decorate having this moment on top of a
58:19 building and there was some beautiful
58:21 dialogue written by the original writers
58:24 for Rutger Hauer to speak and he spoke
58:27 those lines but he also met with Ridley
58:29 Scott before he did the scene because
58:32 they're all exhausted they're about to
58:34 lose their their their darkness right
58:36 this whole film was filmed in the dark
58:38 so they had to film you know court I
58:41 think through the winter here in
58:42 California which you know we don't get
58:44 snow but it gets cold as hell out there
58:46 it'll chill your bones down we get
58:48 really decent wind at the same time and
58:53 Rutger Hauer is up there in a in a
58:55 speedo pretty much almost like some
58:57 sports shorts and a pair of shoes and
59:01 leaves Harrison Ford's you know wrapped
59:03 up in some clothing but he's probably
59:04 soaking wet at the time but he said I've
59:07 got some ideas for some lines that I'd
59:09 like to add to the dialogue that I think
59:11 really work and Ridley Scott who is a
59:14 very you know forceful director because
59:18 he has a very clear vision of what he
59:20 wants actually leaned in and said
59:22 alright you get it after all this man
59:25 you get a couple lines well you know
59:27 we'll cut if it sucks we'll make it redo
59:29 it again but the last lines which I
59:32 won't even repeat so you can see them
59:33 just know that the last couple lines
59:35 that Roy played by Rutger Hauer
59:39 we're written by Rutger Hauer on the
59:41 scene and it's some of the most
59:43 beautiful dialogue you've ever heard
59:45 acid' has actually created a painting
59:48 which some of you might not know that is
59:51 I believe it's called shoulders of Orion
59:54 and for those of you seen the phone you
59:56 know where that line comes from so
59:58 there's a painting that's actually a
59:59 tribute to that final dialogue which is
60:02 what what did that look like that's some
60:07 kind of safe those you know the film
60:08 what did the shoulders of Orion look
60:10 like and he painted it so amount to look
60:13 that up online
60:15 Hollywood used to make great films and
60:18 when I say great films I mean films that
60:22 just became sort of you know heirlooms
60:27 to the family if you own you know though
60:29 if you had the watch from your
60:30 great-great-grandfather in their left
60:32 hand and the DVD of Blade Runner in the
60:35 other hand there was really no
60:37 difference between the two back in the
60:39 day and what's interesting is in 1982
60:42 you have a flurry of films come out that
60:45 it just blow your mighty came out in the
60:47 spring and for those of you who missed
60:50 that whole thing you have people you
60:54 know we were in et world for a year or
60:58 two like we couldn't stop talking about
60:59 it you know and no one owns et anymore
61:03 right it's not you don't have to have et
61:05 in your house because it was made for
61:07 kids and it was locked into a cultural
61:09 moment in history where we were very
61:12 innocent and positive which is somewhere
61:15 you know it's where we need to get back
61:16 to but you have poltergeist and Dark
61:21 Crystal
61:21 and you know Tron and just a bunch of
61:25 stuff go look up the movies released in
61:26 1982 and for my money and my knowledge
61:30 of history there is not a single year in
61:32 Hollywood history where you have more
61:33 blockbusters coming out in a single year
61:36 in 1982 I also want to mention just
61:41 briefly to give some credit because Sid
61:46 did design a huge portion of the biggest
61:49 set pieces
61:51 cars again Jen we Jean Winfield if she
61:54 did a beautiful job creating the cars
61:55 but there is a huge staff of folks that
61:58 created the shot skis the the schwag if
62:04 you will of the film they created the
62:06 gun that Deckard held and all the
62:08 stickers and decals and they created the
62:11 sushi bar and all the neon signs and
62:13 they really busted their ass so there is
62:16 a huge design team that never gets
62:18 mentioned because there's a lot of folks
62:19 that did it that I actually the
62:21 privilege of meeting some of these guys
62:23 during a presentation Warner Brothers
62:25 and so they're you know with all films
62:29 there are heroes stuck in the corners
62:31 holding a light holding a smoke machine
62:33 saving someone's life from falling so
62:36 any great film as a great crew behind it
62:40 in this film
62:41 lism was littered with people that went
62:45 through you know again to financial
62:48 upheavals before the film got done you
62:50 talk about a film that almost never got
62:51 completed it's one of those films you
62:55 know it it went an extra round that I
62:57 know of Wizard of Oz actually had the
62:59 same thing to happen to him I think I
63:01 think they went bankrupt even more the
63:03 rumours are went bankrupt like five or
63:05 six times before that film got finished
63:07 but they were up against you know making
63:09 the first color movie in world history
63:11 along with Gone with the Wind but but
63:15 you wanted when it comes to using CMYK
63:17 cameras all shooting at the same time
63:19 Wizard of Oz was definitely the first
63:21 historical movie to start doing it but
63:24 it took so long to make the film and
63:25 finish it and get it in the can that
63:27 gone with a Wilma was able to come in
63:30 and do this use the same technology and
63:31 actually release and 39 in the same
63:34 exact year but if you haven't seen Blade
63:36 Runner I seriously suggest you go see it
63:39 I find that females of a certain caliber
63:43 really love the film usually older
63:45 females will get into it more than
63:47 younger females but if you're sort of a
63:49 sci-fi buff you like lower you like sort
63:52 of complicated stories up to a point you
63:55 will watch this film and when someone
63:57 whispers in your ear yeah this is made
63:59 1982 there's only a few indicators in
64:02 the film it was ever made
64:03 - and you know we didn't write for the
64:07 need to have special effects there
64:08 weren't you know in Blade Runner there's
64:10 no CG bad guy which if you if you guys
64:13 are tired of that [ __ ] you know it's
64:15 Marvel Civil War part 25 you know it's
64:19 going to be a bunch of human actors with
64:22 a bunch of CG overlay and then there's
64:24 going to be some giant beast that comes
64:26 out of the toilet you know in rips apart
64:28 Manhattan the soundtrack that Vangelis
64:32 eventually made I think is one of the
64:33 most beautiful soundtracks of any film
64:36 ever and I will say that the soundtrack
64:42 of that film is as close to the brain
64:45 wave of Syd Mead that you could ever put
64:48 into music when I listen to that
64:50 soundtrack it's always SIDS world that
64:52 I'm seeing but it was actually Vangelis
64:54 world that he saw they have a pretty
64:56 good box set on YouTube or iTunes excuse
64:59 me that you can buy it's got some goofy
65:02 little extra tracks we put in there
65:04 where he's got his son having fun with
65:06 his dad but that's pretty pretty
65:07 endearing all into itself so again get
65:11 the film
65:12 I recommend the you know the collector's
65:15 edition where you can actually see the
65:16 original version of the film with the
65:18 narration and the last scene with the
65:20 missing extra scene and then go through
65:23 all of the other DVDs and again most of
65:25 you have already done this if you liked
65:26 the film if the other one is to go and
65:30 download the read online the FAQ for
65:34 Blade Runner because after you've seen
65:36 the film you'll find that there are some
65:39 interesting obsessions for the visual
65:41 imagery systems that that Ridley used
65:45 and I'll just say one of the fun ones to
65:48 know about before you see the film is
65:50 that there's a an incredible obsession
65:52 with eyes and there's a lot of Masonic
65:55 stuff too because I believe Ridley is a
65:57 is a Mason and so there's a tremendous
66:01 amount of architecture in the film
66:02 I shouldn't say tremendous there's a
66:04 fair amount of architecture in the film
66:05 that relates to sort of the Mason
66:10 symbolism and the pillars in dr.
66:13 Terrell's office
66:16 are very important omage is to the
66:18 Masons and that when they were erected
66:20 upside down on accident Ridley walked in
66:22 and said what did you guys do didn't you
66:24 pay attention to the drawing it's the
66:26 other way around and it's barely any
66:27 difference but there's a little bit of a
66:29 width difference from top to bottom
66:30 could've been either way it wouldn't
66:32 matter for us but to people who are into
66:34 that kind of thing it's important right
66:37 but the eyes you know there's this
66:39 all-seeing eye at the very beginning and
66:40 we debate about whose eye that is it's
66:43 very interesting so get into that if you
66:46 want to have some fun but only after you
66:48 see the film seeing it twice would be
66:50 the best way to do it watch the original
66:52 read the FAQ and then watch the
66:54 director's cut you'll have a blast and
66:56 then watch all the making-of but I'm
66:59 glad to see that Harrison Ford's on
67:01 board again very excited about seeing
67:02 the sequel let's keep our kidneys
67:04 crossed that it's worth our time Ryan
67:10 Gosling is probably the best guy you
67:11 could probably put in there for now deep
67:14 thoughts radio calm for all the feeds no
67:17 it's a variety show there's video if
67:20 you're on audio audio if you're on video
67:21 there's a locked Facebook group we are
67:24 starting to get pounded by folks who are
67:26 fake so you got you know profiles are
67:28 two days old bunch of fake [ __ ] on
67:30 them so thank God we could lock the
67:33 group and got rid of the page it's on
67:36 iTunes it's on Google Play in the
67:38 podcast form in case you drive to work
67:40 every single day maybe this will make
67:42 the drive a little less boring anyway
67:46 that's it
67:46 take care of yourself in someone else
67:48 and I'll see you in the next detox over
67:50 now
