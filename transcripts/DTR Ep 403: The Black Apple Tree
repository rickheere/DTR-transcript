00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today I'm gonna take a second
00:35 pass with a better phrase those of you
00:43 brand-new welcome to the ride
00:48 I'm calling this episode the black apple
00:51 tree and it came out of a great
00:56 conversation with the friend of mine
00:59 because I finally put a term to it that
01:01 seems like what it is but I didn't a an
01:05 episode called alien consciousness some
01:09 time ago and what it amounted to and
01:12 this is how it came out with my friend
01:14 Lauren she said look do you believe in
01:17 aliens and I said well you know it's cuz
01:19 she's like hey she's a brilliant person
01:21 so she says look I'm talking about you
01:26 know aliens from outer space as well as
01:28 these you know now super popular
01:31 interdimensional theory and so I'm sort
01:34 of thinking about I thought well you
01:36 know we've covered you know I've done
01:37 episodes on everything you guys know
01:39 that and so you know there are the great
01:45 alien theories of reptile aliens I mean
01:47 everything out there is up for grabs
01:49 right the ones that look like us one
01:51 that looked like Norwegians what looks
01:52 like Tesla's wife ex-wife you know Elon
01:56 Musk's ex-wife excuse me how dare I
01:59 defame the man but England consciousness
02:03 I mean dirt around an idea and here's
02:05 what's interesting has come up in other
02:07 people's videos other people's comments
02:11 and I'm gonna give it a name and after I
02:17 give it this name which is black Apple
02:21 it's going to give you a defense
02:23 mechanism and a paradigm to wrap this
02:26 moment up which is what if there was a
02:33 it could be all within the human body
02:36 we're going to talk about that and
02:37 there's something else we have
02:38 watch out for because I think there's
02:40 good information that might come from
02:41 this location but it's going to be
02:45 interesting I have to personally listen
02:47 to my own mind and study what I'm about
02:51 to describe to really discern it perhaps
02:52 an additional video on this but it goes
02:55 something like this
02:57 aliens have come from outside it's sort
03:00 of a neat metaphor for how you would
03:03 handle what they could do to you
03:05 you got your own world your own house
03:07 your own planet and here comes some
03:09 aliens well you know they're not from
03:11 here you know even though they might
03:12 have visited maybe they consider this
03:14 one of their properties but they would
03:16 come and go when they go back to their
03:17 place which is really advanced if you
03:21 were scared of aliens you could just you
03:22 know crawl up and and just then a ball
03:24 on your basement go well I can't wait
03:26 did they leave and obviously if you're
03:29 good with them you would take from them
03:31 what you like and leave everything else
03:33 behind
03:34 that's that metaphor that real life on
03:38 point moment is going to be metaphorical
03:40 for us in this other conversation but
03:44 alien consciousness talks about
03:46 something that is hidden around us an
03:50 interdimensional life force that mimics
03:53 so many life forms that we have on
03:55 planet Earth
03:56 how many of you've seen a whale with a
03:59 little tiny fish that swim by his mouth
04:01 he's eaten plankton and they're eaten
04:03 perhaps Pointon as well this happens a
04:07 lot I mean you'll have a smaller
04:08 creature hangs out with a bigger
04:10 creature they're not predators of each
04:11 other and so they share the scraps okay
04:16 we also know of you know barnacles that
04:20 will attach themselves to a ship hole
04:22 and man they're eating like crazy
04:24 whatever they eat it's just being washed
04:25 over them constantly must be awesome to
04:27 be on a ship if you're a barnacle but
04:29 even if you're a barnacle on a rock on
04:31 the coast the water is constantly
04:33 churning keeping life ever new for you
04:37 and you're eating constantly the best
04:40 you can eat a lot of life lives in you
04:44 know lagoons and areas where water
04:48 fluctuates regularly okay
04:52 imagine we had something like that but
04:54 doesn't have a body if it has a body
04:57 we're unaware of it I mean even even if
04:59 something can remain invisible to our
05:01 eyes if you reach up to touch your face
05:03 and then wait before you get to your
05:05 face you're eating something else and
05:06 your face starts to depress you know you
05:08 guess I'm invisible on you we don't
05:10 experience that then god did you imagine
05:13 how bizarre the world would be I got
05:16 five of them on me help me out know what
05:18 I'm talking about is a pure
05:21 consciousness being race of beings
05:25 species of beings oppressions a race but
05:28 our species of beings that might feed
05:30 off of the electrical emotions or other
05:34 properties maybe not electrons maybe
05:37 other things that we don't sense at all
05:39 we don't acknowledge unless you believe
05:41 in a soul perhaps there's some you know
05:43 frequency coming off the soul and these
05:46 things feed off of it and they don't
05:50 really have a massive perhaps they don't
05:53 have a massive context for our life but
05:56 one thing they do understand is our
05:58 thoughts and they simply pattern
06:01 recognition Wow when that person had
06:03 that type of thought this huge meal came
06:06 out of them and I ate it now
06:10 imagine that every single emotion that
06:13 we have which is this infinite complex
06:15 choice from happiness to sadness to
06:18 indifference to melancholy whatever you
06:21 got loneliness you're totally excited
06:27 maybe you're on a motorcycle going 130
06:30 up the highway in the middle of the
06:31 night that kind of adrenaline rush every
06:35 single variation in our emotion could be
06:37 a variation in the meal taste
06:41 quote-unquote for these individuals for
06:43 these this race this species this
06:48 interdimensional thing that's around us
06:50 now am I just making this up no if you
06:54 saw the alien consciousness I gave you a
06:57 geographical analogy or way to discern
07:03 the difference between the two and with
07:05 interesting is I think every single one
07:07 of you hearing my voice will be able to
07:10 immediately apply this to your life and
07:12 immediately go whoa this is cool on one
07:16 level and a little freaky on another so
07:20 this has to do with who owns one of your
07:28 thoughts now the sterile definition is
07:33 you obviously own all of your thoughts
07:35 that's the sterile definition because by
07:37 the time you accept it into your
07:39 consciousness and roll it around your
07:41 brain it is your thought is your
07:44 possession but now if I said to you tell
07:49 me an empirical truth about your life
07:51 I've asked you that question I'm one
07:53 human being on this side you're on the
07:54 other side tell me something that you
07:56 love that's an easy one that you really
07:59 really love and when someone says well I
08:02 love my mother I love rock climbing I
08:06 love surfing like sitting around smoking
08:09 cigars I love it I like it whatever
08:12 here's an analogy and I think a
08:19 specificity of that thing that thought
08:22 manifesting in you and coming out of you
08:25 as a word and the Guru's of India have a
08:28 science around at least this first half
08:29 they may have a science around the
08:31 second half but I've never heard any
08:32 other human being talk about this so I'm
08:35 excited
08:36 the way that the Hindus or at least I
08:40 had it explained to me through a guy
08:42 here an American Caucasian guy who had
08:45 studied Hindus at a at a super duper
08:46 level he went over there and lived there
08:49 for a long time and he said that they
08:53 talked about the fact that you create
08:56 the sort of communication bubble that is
09:00 what you're about to say you manifested
09:03 in your heart and it comes up out into
09:07 your vocal cords and then it is
09:11 communicated and they have a lot of
09:14 different observations of how love and
09:16 hate and and they use their mechanism to
09:18 talk about how you
09:19 would control the manifestation such
09:22 that you don't color yourself dark to
09:25 other people you know you get into those
09:27 situations if you've had a bad day and
09:29 so everything sucks and everything you
09:30 talk about it's a complaint then you eat
09:33 or you relax and you're like oh my god
09:35 well the world isn't actually so bad you
09:37 know it's like yeah you needed to poop
09:40 okay now let's go to the other side of
09:45 the game because that is really warming
09:49 right whatever you believe is what you
09:51 believe in if I ask you and it comes
09:52 from you we're having this almost pure
09:55 truth conversation about what you
09:58 believe what you don't believe doesn't
09:59 mean it doesn't mean that what you
10:01 believe is true is true it's just it is
10:03 true that it's coming out of you but now
10:07 I leave the room or wherever we are now
10:11 you're sitting there with your thoughts
10:13 hmm now you're by yourself and you could
10:17 just be sitting on your sofa in your
10:19 front room and no one's talking to you
10:21 you got a whole house full of kids and
10:22 family no one's talking to you just for
10:24 that moment they're not ignoring you or
10:26 anything and you're sitting around
10:28 thinking about things and maybe you
10:30 think about things that are functional
10:33 hey you know can you guys pick up your
10:35 toys here could you pick up your food
10:37 over there honey could you bring a glass
10:39 of water it's utilitarian statements not
10:43 much to it maybe what you desire is
10:46 driven by this other thing but let me
10:49 take you back to your adolescence your
10:53 pre adolescent stage of perhaps dating
10:56 someone for the very first time going
10:57 steady as we used to say right well
11:01 there's nothing more tender in this
11:02 world than a young person dating another
11:04 young person and trying to sort out all
11:07 those emotions
11:08 sadly parents don't talk to their kids
11:11 about this this phase which is why I
11:13 always say make sure you parent from the
11:16 very beginning don't wait to parent
11:18 later on those kids running around the
11:21 restaurant and then the parent you know
11:24 realizes that everybody else has got
11:26 kids that behave these parents have
11:28 taught their kids hey the restaurants a
11:30 playground and so they
11:33 jump up and they try to discipline their
11:35 child for the very first time in a
11:36 restaurant the kids like what are you
11:39 doing you know you you don't discipline
11:41 wait you know when we're in the car you
11:43 we do whatever we want you never say
11:44 anything when we're home we do over
11:46 whatever we want and you're just a
11:48 pushover parent you're not even a parent
11:49 you're like a feeding Guardian some
11:53 parents have a lot of [ __ ]
11:54 philosophies for being lazy parents
11:56 don't be one okay but when you fall in
12:00 love
12:02 you're usually left to your own devices
12:05 parents using to talk to the kids about
12:07 falling in love with other people too
12:09 early because they don't want it to
12:10 happen too early mmm maybe you don't
12:14 need to talk to him at three years old
12:15 but maybe around 10 11 12 and you're
12:19 starting to get close once you prime
12:20 them for a couple years before they hit
12:21 13 my kid jumped off at 13 you know
12:25 hardcore you're sitting there and you're
12:29 for the first party relationship it
12:32 usually goes grand you know you're just
12:34 in euphoria having another human being
12:36 love you as much as you love them has
12:38 got to be one of the most amazing states
12:41 of mind you could possibly be in
12:43 especially when you can't define with
12:46 words how much you love somebody else
12:48 and they seem to have the same problem
12:50 you can't hold hands enough you can't
12:52 sit next to each other enough you can't
12:54 spoon close enough at night depending on
12:57 how old you are of course but when
13:00 you're young you know you get to see
13:01 these people usually at school maybe if
13:05 you're lucky they live in your
13:06 neighborhood maybe you get a chance to
13:09 see him at the swimming pool in the
13:10 summertime whatever you're obviously
13:12 scrapping for every ounce of being
13:14 together you possibly can which I think
13:16 was beautifully portrayed in season
13:17 three of stranger things by the way but
13:20 then you know the euphoria sort of calms
13:24 down doesn't go away but it calms down
13:26 the would they say infatuation stage
13:30 those things don't have to end I know
13:32 some people have been married for twenty
13:33 thirty years you were still utterly
13:35 infatuated with each other which is a
13:37 beautiful thing but let's say you go
13:41 through this phase that I went through
13:42 horribly which was jealousy
13:47 my first highschool sweetheart
13:50 bless her soul she had to put up with me
13:52 we did it for a year and a half and
13:54 again just like I just described her and
13:57 I were together constantly but then
14:00 eventually you have other hemispheres of
14:03 your life now I was pretty introverted
14:06 when I wasn't extroverted so I was
14:08 really good at being introverted and
14:09 really good at being extroverted and so
14:12 when I went home I just jumped into my
14:15 computers jumped into my art were all
14:17 this other stuff and this sounds idiotic
14:21 but the more idiotic it sounds you're
14:23 gonna understand the second part of this
14:25 which is I thought she would do the same
14:28 thing she went hang out with her friends
14:31 friends she had before she met me oh go
14:33 figure right I was just a very immature
14:38 kid at that point in that particular
14:40 realm of life right and so we go to her
14:44 friends parties and I was always there
14:47 and not and almost no one else had a
14:49 boyfriend so I'm just sitting there and
14:50 it was sort of like I enjoyed that I
14:54 could enjoy it but you know I was always
14:56 like okay let's get out of here so we
14:57 get a few minutes to ourselves before I
14:59 have to take you home to your parents
15:00 house and then just like clockwork my
15:06 mind you know Here I am a writer now go
15:08 figure I had this engine a long time ago
15:11 my mind would start writing stories
15:13 about where she was when she wasn't with
15:19 me after a year went by you know there
15:22 were people that realized it's one of
15:24 the situations where someone doesn't pay
15:26 attention to a girl until she just gets
15:30 super confident with herself and you
15:31 know like her and I are great and and
15:33 then she becomes really appealing to the
15:35 other guys and so guys what sort of you
15:37 know try to get close to her and stuff
15:39 and I was noticing a little bit this it
15:40 really didn't happen that much to be
15:42 honest but I would sit there and this
15:46 happens in adult fashion as well but
15:50 what I didn't realize and I realized
15:52 this just in this last 12 months so it's
15:56 great about doing this show man you
15:57 figure out all kinds of stuff about
15:59 yourself
16:00 but I distinctly will see things like
16:04 almost you know a virtual reality it's
16:07 out there in front of me it's in my
16:09 mind's eye you know I'm not crazy yet oh
16:12 and it's like something is presenting a
16:16 scene to me based on partial truths and
16:20 partial you know I possibilities of
16:23 things that could happen and because
16:25 this thing is wired into your brain it
16:27 knows it kind of knows what you're
16:29 willing to believe about a particular
16:30 subject and I don't know how it works
16:34 I don't know if it's now Freud would
16:35 probably say it's like an E deco or
16:37 something like that suddenly your your
16:39 inner child echoing out this ultimate
16:44 constant fear I don't know really wish I
16:48 could talk to that guy but what I found
16:50 was this if I allow in this external
16:56 presentation to my life as a oh my gosh
17:01 I need to react to this yeah that's
17:03 probably have you probably right now
17:05 there's another side of this because I
17:07 have some intuition its killer and a lot
17:09 of you do and it's one of these sort of
17:13 it's gonna be a love-hate filtering
17:15 system I'm gonna teach you how was it to
17:18 you what I do to to filter this input
17:23 because there's a good source out there
17:25 to which I think it's the spirits of
17:27 those who want to help us it could be
17:29 your relatives could be someone you
17:30 never met something could be God who
17:33 knows but this is where we get to the
17:37 name of the episode here's the analogy
17:40 I'm gonna give you that you can repeat
17:42 to yourself to others and then you can
17:44 explain this to them and depending on
17:45 how open-minded they are metaphorically
17:48 speaking what this force is doing is
17:51 it's trying to ruin your life
17:54 it's trying to make you react it's
17:57 trying to get you in trouble it's trying
18:00 to get a rise out of you
18:01 it doesn't care if you really go and do
18:03 anything about your feelings as long as
18:04 you just have them so maybe you're
18:07 sitting there going I know she's not
18:08 cheating her I know he's not cheating or
18:10 whatever the concern is
18:13 we just I don't know if they love me
18:15 anymore you know they used to say I love
18:17 you a lot now it's calming down and does
18:18 that mean something whatever it is I
18:21 want you to envision a tree and on that
18:25 tree are black apples every single time
18:30 one of these super negative manipulative
18:32 visions come into your life listen this
18:35 doesn't matter if this if I'm not
18:37 correct about being an interdimensional
18:39 species or if it's just something built
18:41 into us this is how it happens
18:44 one let's remember when I ask you
18:47 something it comes from inside outs I'm
18:49 getting what your true beliefs are from
18:51 the inside out as you express things to
18:53 yourself it comes from that location in
18:56 your chest in your heart
18:57 perhaps your soul these other things
19:01 come from outside to you and what I want
19:05 you to envision in your brain is a
19:06 defense mechanism because wrapping
19:08 something in a paradigm of physical
19:10 tangibility it really helps when you
19:13 have to battle these sort of things and
19:15 this could help you battle addiction
19:16 this could help you battle every single
19:18 thing on planet earth you could be
19:20 suffering from PTSD and this is a great
19:22 way to to deny in these negative things
19:28 and to preserve what's inside you but
19:32 imagine a tree is right in front of you
19:34 when this negative stuff starts coming
19:36 in and the branch just it's intelligent
19:39 it just kind of bends right towards you
19:42 and it's got this gorgeous black Apple
19:46 on it
19:47 never seen one before but you know it's
19:49 black it's just perfect right what it's
19:53 trying to do is say here eat this and if
19:58 you pull it off then you've started to
20:01 accept it as your thought when it ain't
20:03 your thought and if you bite into it you
20:07 swallow it inside you and you will add
20:10 it to your otherwise pure self on the
20:13 inside you will maybe perhaps believe
20:16 something or choose to believe something
20:18 because of your actions of taking this
20:20 from the outside in and you'll say oh
20:23 it's like the Shakespeare play Othello
20:27 yaahh goes is buddy Yago is the black
20:30 apple tree if you're writing maybe this
20:33 will help you sort some things out but
20:36 what did yo do Yago continually told the
20:41 king that his wife was cheating on him
20:45 and every single time he didn't have his
20:47 wife in his mind's eye or sorry in his
20:50 sorry his vision
20:51 Yago was there to plug up his brain with
20:54 a bunch of fakeness the second that she
20:57 showed any affection towards another man
20:59 or helped another man yoga was right
21:01 there and that's one of the guys she's
21:02 sleeping with a fellow kills his wife
21:09 because he let all this black Apple
21:12 matter inside of himself he became dark
21:15 because you are what you eat right and
21:18 then of course he finds out Iago's lying
21:21 bad news man bad news now some of us
21:27 might experience betrayal from someone
21:29 and for whatever reason we choose to
21:32 negotiate and come up with the solution
21:36 we're done with that right yeah all
21:38 right like I've been in relationships
21:41 where I dated someone long term and it
21:45 really wasn't going well for months you
21:48 know he said hi to each other and all
21:50 that stuff sometimes we live in the same
21:53 place sometimes we didn't and so when
21:55 you're far away from someone and you
21:57 know you're thinking guy this whole
21:58 thing isn't working out I'm never gonna
21:59 end up with this person if you had an
22:02 option you might take it to have a
22:04 moment of stimulation from someone else
22:08 and they just beat you to it or whatever
22:09 so when it comes in the door you're like
22:11 yeah yeah I was with somebody else the
22:13 other night and whatever you know I only
22:15 see it once a week I spend seven days or
22:17 six days alone a week yeah this other
22:19 thing happened okay you don't have to
22:22 [ __ ] all over yourself right you can
22:23 keep going with life and go okay well do
22:26 we want to get past this so should we
22:27 just call it quits and you're like well
22:29 now you know what that other person made
22:31 me appreciate you way more than I ever
22:32 did I'm sorry I did that but it was
22:35 obviously a value to see me move on so
22:37 I've actually made that choice myself
22:40 and so then in my brain I could say that
22:45 versus a cheater they just are and
22:48 Hollywood really plays up anything that
22:50 breaks up a relationship because that's
22:52 what the global agenda is is to break us
22:55 all up right single income household
22:59 because there's no there isn't only one
23:01 parent that's a wet dream for a banker
23:04 us working it out they hate that so they
23:06 want to dramatize and pay for any movies
23:08 that will make that the eventualities
23:11 I just completed a film that actually
23:14 has a break up but it wasn't a marriage
23:17 so let's let's reiterate one more time
23:21 when you're sitting by yourself and
23:23 you're taking in visions you could just
23:24 be lying in bed and the ceiling becomes
23:26 your little projector you're sitting in
23:29 your car you're driving you know and you
23:31 know it's like autopilot when you drive
23:32 for ten years you're in jam traffic for
23:34 forty five minutes to two hours and so
23:37 you got a lot of time to think about
23:38 things you can get all upset what you
23:42 need to do is deny the Apple what you
23:46 have to do in my opinion is to tell
23:48 yourself you'll get you'll get
23:50 mesmerized by it right I've been
23:52 practicing this now for at least six
23:54 months and I can't remember when I first
23:57 turned it on but I'll watch the movie
23:59 man I was just like oh oh and it man
24:01 it's amazing it's elaborate it's totally
24:04 believable until you wake up and then
24:08 you're like well that's [ __ ] that's
24:10 all fake that is in reality if you're
24:13 having paranoia about another person
24:16 here's one way to say it - I refuse to
24:19 take in this negative characterization
24:22 of someone I love or someone I like my
24:24 buddy or my lover or whatever he or she
24:27 deserves to be protected from this crap
24:31 I'm not eating an apple a black Apple
24:34 and polluting my vision of someone when
24:37 they don't deserve it because you know
24:38 if there's any afterlife whatsoever and
24:41 there's some point where we meet each
24:42 other you're gonna see them for exactly
24:44 who they were and perhaps maybe our
24:47 history will be evaluated I doubt it but
24:49 if it happens you're going - oh I
24:51 thought you cheated on me well I thought
24:53 you did too
24:54 oh gosh how did we get these ideas in
24:56 his oh about a little thing that was on
24:59 us when we were back down on earth hmm
25:01 okay high five boom we didn't do
25:04 anything to each other but what's
25:05 important is you don't wait til you die
25:07 to figure out that information we want
25:09 to live a great life when we're here one
25:12 of the things I've definitely seen from
25:14 very diplomatic human beings not just
25:17 diplomats but diplomatic human beings is
25:19 when someone accuses something someone
25:22 of something and that person who's
25:25 listening to this rumor this gossip
25:27 about another person's bad actions will
25:29 do one of two things will do a lot of
25:31 things but at least one of two things
25:33 that are very very wise it's very good
25:36 for us
25:37 one they realized that every every story
25:41 has two sides that's huge
25:43 two they might have motive to crap on
25:47 another human being somehow they believe
25:50 that if someone else loses they win not
25:53 true right not true
25:54 but there is okay in my opinion in my
25:59 experience and I actually have a third
26:02 one too which I'll share with you guys
26:04 which I think we all have I believe that
26:10 we have massive intuition if we are open
26:12 to it and open to spirits of those that
26:17 have past those that may have never been
26:19 born they're just out there and you're
26:23 in a creative situation let's just say
26:26 or you're trying to make a good business
26:27 decision or you met somebody new and
26:29 you're trying to feel your gut as the
26:31 Asians like to say I love that love the
26:34 fact they say that but your gut is just
26:36 going get away right do you ever
26:39 interview someone to your pet and your
26:40 pets just like yeah this is a bad person
26:43 and then you're like I don't understand
26:44 in a couple weeks you understand while
26:47 your pet was totally intuitive about
26:49 them being a good person or a bad person
26:51 because your pets seeing a lot more
26:53 frequencies off the human being so
26:56 here's the way to parse it if you're
27:01 getting this big negative story about
27:03 something a reason to be cautious stuff
27:05 that makes you fearful
27:07 think about if you had bills due and you
27:09 didn't have a lot of money but I can
27:11 just feed on you all day long that bill
27:13 that bill my god you're gonna get kicked
27:15 out on the street or you can lose your
27:16 car you're gonna lose your job you're
27:18 gonna just be homeless that bill all
27:21 right you don't want that but that's
27:24 negative that's a black apple and it's
27:26 very apparent it's a black Apple when
27:30 you were looking for advice on life hmm
27:34 a lot more context to advice and you
27:38 know again it's your gut feeling it's
27:40 your gut feeling about something you are
27:43 assessing very intentionally almost
27:47 almost a whole wholly the insides right
27:50 you're taking your insides and you're
27:51 using them to analyze something but you
27:54 will have these sort of whims that come
27:57 out of nowhere that'll say like you're
27:59 sorting through all the options on your
28:02 little options list or your little
28:05 mechanism you'll tricorder this says
28:07 good or bad and you're touring it
28:09 through all the different settings and
28:11 sometimes you'll put it on a setting
28:13 good and you get this quaff out of the
28:15 universe that's true that person is good
28:17 you could trust that person and you know
28:19 maybe used-car salesman and you know not
28:22 to my dad sold used cars but you know
28:25 you get to some sleazy person it was
28:28 just weird they feel like other people
28:29 that have done you wrong and sometimes
28:32 you get that well this person just feels
28:34 like that person they're actually
28:35 genuine or you'll get that feeling run
28:37 away that's not necessarily one of these
28:42 big dramatized things that can happen to
28:44 your mind that is really going for the
28:46 blood the black Apple wants blood it
28:50 wants destruction and it's sad that this
28:54 mechanism seems to present almost
28:59 unanimously negativity now some
29:02 religious people might call those demons
29:04 and I wouldn't necessarily try to
29:06 dissuade you from that but just remember
29:11 to put it in a different context with
29:14 words that you are definitely accustomed
29:16 to we have a phrase called daydreaming
29:20 daydreaming is when this happens you can
29:24 daydream about something wonderful
29:26 winning the lottery getting the career
29:28 of your dreams and those are good and
29:32 that's sort of that other flavor and I'm
29:36 gonna get to hear you know Tony Robbins
29:39 always tells you to envision yourself a
29:41 year from now and be very serious about
29:43 it and then five years and then ten
29:45 years and then what he does he says look
29:47 make that scenario as realistic as
29:50 possible such that you can get it but
29:53 also you know he wants to say okay what
29:56 is the goal that you want in life and
29:58 let's just say for me it's the sell
30:02 movies constantly write them and sell
30:03 them constantly I don't care about I can
30:05 do TV 2 or whatever but right now I'm
30:07 film alright well you write a bunch of
30:10 films you wait for them to get evaluated
30:11 you hope to god that a studio is ready
30:14 to buy that kind of script boom there it
30:16 goes and then of course there's the
30:18 silver screen moment where after 300
30:21 people work really hard for a year and a
30:23 half two years plus you get to sit in a
30:25 screening room and see your name up on
30:27 there you know like I did it I finally
30:30 did it hope everyone loves the film you
30:33 know it's it's the only thing you can
30:34 really hope for in the end but then if
30:36 you get celebrated for doing something
30:37 that you love then you can get paid to
30:39 do it 24/7 well that's great so then
30:44 what are the benefits of your goal for
30:46 for me would be to do what I love
30:48 constantly doesn't matter how old I get
30:50 I can always crank out any scripts
30:52 always always always maybe take a break
30:54 into a book you know whatever may be I
30:56 invent a television show you know
30:58 whatever it is I'll always have a job as
31:01 long as my brain is what I'm using to
31:02 get the job and not my physique right
31:06 but when I and I guess it could be
31:09 called daydreaming but daydreaming
31:12 I always chalk up to sort of an
31:15 involuntary moment which is worth about
31:17 the black apples come from you're just
31:19 sitting there and you're not even you're
31:21 bored I mean not even bored you're just
31:23 kind of listening to the universe all
31:26 this negativity comes in so you deny it
31:28 you acknowledge it's there and what you
31:31 need to say is that's not my thought
31:33 if someone makes you think something bad
31:36 about someone you need to say I think
31:39 you need to say it out loud quite
31:40 frankly but it's almost between you and
31:42 your Creator too and you just simply say
31:45 I refuse to judge that person to accuse
31:51 that person of something they didn't do
31:54 because what I just saw they didn't do
31:56 now you might be reliving a moment of
31:58 betrayal and that's a little bit
32:00 different that's a memory and you're
32:02 speculating as to what happened like if
32:04 your spouse said oh yeah I went to this
32:06 hotel and I slept with this other person
32:07 and we six hours having sex is that it
32:10 and they actually told you that well
32:12 then you weren't there and so you might
32:15 envision in your brain and hurt yourself
32:17 all day long with with that event that's
32:19 dangerous because I think the species is
32:22 right there to write that script for you
32:24 you need to do yourself a solid and just
32:28 put it past you if that kind of
32:30 situation breaks your relationship which
32:32 it probably would if you're really
32:34 committed then you need to just totally
32:37 get rid of that person probably
32:39 physically move to some other location
32:41 in your area whatever you got to do you
32:44 got to completely cut that out your life
32:45 because it's just going to consume
32:47 invaluable seconds minutes days hours
32:50 years whatever in your life and you
32:52 deserve to live you have to go see my
32:55 episode on betrayal now the other one
33:00 which I won't spend a tremendous amount
33:02 of time on but it is when I
33:03 intentionally I guess well I'm when I'm
33:07 writing when I'm writing it comes to me
33:10 in two different ways one will be I
33:13 don't know circumstances will just
33:16 happen in front of me and any of you've
33:17 ever ever had a creative moment you know
33:19 this is how it works you're just sitting
33:21 there on all of a sudden a big chunk of
33:23 this fictional thing if you're a
33:25 musician it's oh it's a riff comes to
33:28 you are you usually going to bed at
33:29 night you know like oh my god I have to
33:31 get up and figure out this rift keep a
33:33 little recorder next to you and just
33:35 sing it into the record and go back to
33:37 bed but I'll see these chunks of films
33:40 and it's for me it is like sneaking into
33:45 the future it's sneaking into the movie
33:47 theater and
33:47 seeing it completed and so I just rip it
33:53 off you know no one else is there with
33:55 me so I assume I'm the one of the only
33:56 writers going for this it so you steal
34:01 as much as you can you know in the
34:03 analogy of Jurassic Park story by
34:05 Michael Crichton
34:06 they had some DNA from mosquito in some
34:10 amber they pulled that out and then they
34:13 were missing some of the DNA due to
34:14 damage or whatever and so they put frog
34:16 DNA in in there and of course that's the
34:19 whole story about it changing sexes and
34:21 all that stuff right brilliant idea I
34:24 mean utterly freaking bright idea even
34:26 if dinosaurs didn't exist so what's
34:29 important in this process of
34:31 acknowledging this mechanism and I
34:34 assure you it just depends on how
34:36 balanced your as an individual if you
34:38 don't have this issue where you have
34:42 suspicions every once in a while or
34:44 whatever you just know it's it's almost
34:46 not chartered it's just negative
34:50 imagination I guess you could say it's
34:53 just so incredibly elaborate and it
34:55 pushes every single button it's almost
34:58 like it's almost like a lock and key you
35:04 have locks in your mind that will only
35:06 turn only unlock these bad emotions if
35:10 the key is perfect and what is amazing
35:12 is is this key is always perfect it
35:14 always gets right in unlocks throws I
35:16 look at this and you're like I don't
35:18 want anything to do with that but you
35:21 don't want to become shut off to the
35:23 outside influences of the universe at
35:25 the same exact time you're trying to
35:26 protect yourself against these things I
35:28 think it's very distinct circumstance
35:32 but I've I made the episode alien
35:35 consciousness and then I think I was
35:38 flying following I think I name's Lynn
35:42 Collins she's the actress from John
35:46 Carter and she has her own spiritual
35:49 enlightenment channel on on the web she
35:53 has her own domain but she gives away
35:55 little segments of this in her Instagram
35:59 feed routinely
36:01 and so I saw this and she was talking
36:03 about this exact thing she's into a lot
36:05 of things I'm not into like Toro cards
36:06 and all the astrology and stuff which I
36:09 don't like at all but she's very nice to
36:13 listen to so anyway she was talking
36:15 about this and all of a sudden she hit
36:17 on that something that was exactly what
36:18 this is but it was we're all struggling
36:22 to give it some words you know imagine
36:25 you're talking to a friend your life is
36:28 good you figured this technique out or
36:30 you never had this problem to begin with
36:31 but your friend across the table or on
36:34 the phone or whatever starts to talk
36:35 about what you know he's doing that you
36:37 know she's doing this where I fear she's
36:39 doing that he's doing this or whatever
36:40 your business partner could be anything
36:43 you can now say to them well maybe not
36:50 make sure you don't eat that black Apple
36:53 and they're gonna say what the hell you
36:55 talking about
36:55 I'm gonna say you're seeing things right
36:58 you're seeing things and you're
37:00 rationalizing things you've created
37:01 these stories that may or may not be
37:04 true but let's give them the benefit of
37:08 the doubt until we find out if this is
37:11 actually occurring because it's
37:13 important it's like that old saying when
37:17 you assume you make an ass out of you
37:21 and me this is pretty much right along
37:24 the lines of us it's an advanced course
37:26 and assuming something I think the
37:28 definitive thing is that and here's the
37:33 thing the definitive thing is that this
37:35 comes from the outside in and it's all
37:37 negative as I have shared this concept
37:40 with at least a dozen people in the last
37:43 six to eight months whenever I made that
37:46 episode to figure this out for myself
37:49 everyone I've talked to you goes oh my
37:51 god this does happen to me and that's
37:55 interesting that we don't allow these
37:57 things to occur now we're in a state in
38:01 the universe you know where all kinds of
38:04 bad things are being revealed and I
38:05 don't mean moon missions that's that's
38:07 that's child's play compared to some of
38:09 the horrible things that are happening
38:10 but we are being lured into and we're
38:13 feeding each other
38:14 these sort of maybe totally true maybe
38:18 only even partially true maybe we're
38:20 saying someone's evil and we think we're
38:22 saying it's level 10 but we are only
38:24 really describing level 4 of their
38:26 actual 10 they do things way beyond
38:30 hideous and we don't know it's still
38:33 better for us to stay in reality as much
38:36 as we possibly can because you know if
38:39 the world were to get real hot you know
38:43 there we know that there are forces and
38:45 I don't mean to get off on this I'll
38:46 just do a little tangent on this there
38:48 are forces that have pretty much
38:49 admitted they're trying to create civil
38:51 war in several countries they've got it
38:53 going in Paris and Hong Kong and a bunch
38:58 of other places that I don't know but
39:00 definitely they're trying to do it in
39:01 America as much as they possibly can
39:03 getting us to fight over issues well
39:07 this mechanism if not controlled could
39:09 be the fuelling force and has nothing to
39:11 do with Jorge Soler threatened to check
39:13 it's just I've given you things to be
39:15 suspicious about because I know how the
39:17 mind works and eats itself up with this
39:19 mechanism you'll just go on autopilot
39:22 the whole time now I have had situations
39:25 in my lifetime and I have to say this is
39:31 where it gets tough for myself
39:32 personally I've definitely had at least
39:38 one individual in my lifetime that was
39:41 in love with who has lied to me on the
39:45 ultimate level more than once and I will
39:51 be in location one and like we lived
39:56 let's say five miles from each other
39:59 something like that and I was in the
40:02 where I live and I remember I was
40:06 feeling and this happened more than once
40:09 you're like why did you hang out with
40:11 this person more than once that's what
40:13 love does right but one evening it's
40:16 late it's probably 11:30 my time here
40:20 I'm up at 12:30 and I had this just
40:26 really sinking feeling that
40:28 than was really wrong and I was being
40:30 betrayed and it was heavy I mean it was
40:34 like it wasn't uh it wasn't so much this
40:36 projection thing it just entered my
40:38 consciousness like someone just
40:41 whispered in my ear and said she's not
40:46 even home and that meant that she was
40:48 somebody else and I I was like okay this
40:56 is gonna eat me up all evening and I got
40:57 a lot of [ __ ] I got to do so I don't
41:00 know if you're like that but like you
41:01 know if someone's preoccupying your
41:02 minor somethings preoccupying your mind
41:04 you have to go and handle it because you
41:06 can't be creative and then you know you
41:09 won't create positivity if you're being
41:11 paranoid about negativity and so I
41:15 decided to hop in my car I felt like
41:18 crap doing this because I thought I am
41:20 accusing this person I'm allowing this
41:22 accusation to become true but this was
41:24 like it felt like a ton of bricks
41:27 I mean seriously felt like someone
41:28 filled my heart full of like a really
41:31 dread iikind of feeling and so I cruised
41:34 over and all I want to do is drive by
41:36 her place her car's always parked there
41:38 it's kind of stalkerish which you know
41:42 was sort of sad now I've gone over there
41:44 and just knocked on the door and hopped
41:45 into bed with her so it's not exactly
41:47 out of this world
41:48 anyway I drove over and sure enough the
41:50 car's gone and thing is I had text
41:54 messages on my phone I'm home I'm gonna
41:58 gotta go to bed whatever I've even had
42:01 the phone call once where I was actually
42:03 looking at the empty parking space the
42:04 whole lights are off and this person's
42:06 telling me that they're home and I can
42:08 tell they're in the car okay get out of
42:10 your car and go inside well why do I do
42:13 that because I don't think you're home I
42:14 am home well I'm in your driveway and
42:16 then I'm an [ __ ] right how dare you
42:19 you know it's like dude just tell me the
42:22 truth I'm totally an adult here if we
42:24 want to move on hey it won't be happy
42:26 news but at least it's a lot better than
42:28 trying to hang on to someone who's lying
42:29 to you and eventually didn't work out
42:31 you know of course but the reason why I
42:34 bring this up is obviously multiple fold
42:37 but imagine this is for whatever reason
42:41 are
42:42 reality for us and again it could be
42:44 totally within our own consciousness and
42:46 this is just simply how it portrays
42:48 itself to us from the outside in part of
42:52 me thinks there's validity to an outside
42:55 species one because come on is this
42:57 place completely barren just because we
42:59 can't see it it doesn't exist no no no
43:01 right but if it was in your head why
43:03 doesn't it give you the sensibility that
43:05 it's in your head if I asked you if you
43:08 loved somebody that you loved you're
43:10 gonna feel like that comes from the
43:11 inside not from the outside so when this
43:14 distinctly comes from the outside lease
43:16 for me and all the friends I've ever
43:17 talked to it's uh its first a little
43:22 freaky and but second almost immediately
43:25 you're in control and that's what's cool
43:28 nothing manipulates you anymore my fear
43:33 one of my fears is if someone's into
43:35 substance abuse as a result of this
43:38 paranoia eating them up are these
43:40 negative emotions eating them up if
43:42 you're impaired mentally I don't know if
43:45 you have the wherewithal to stop
43:47 reacting to this stuff and take
43:51 inventory ago that isn't that isn't
43:53 going on it's not truth that's just some
43:57 fictions being projected at me to get a
43:59 reaction out of me to make me ruin my
44:01 life you know now does that mean that we
44:06 can't sit down and discern something
44:08 that is going on you do get the text
44:12 message with someone's home they took
44:14 you know they call you from their house
44:16 but they never go inside but they always
44:18 do they always you always hear their
44:19 footsteps you're the the gate slam you
44:22 hear the footsteps on the concrete and
44:23 the footsteps on the hardwood floors and
44:26 then there's usually a tooth brushing
44:27 thing and a bedtime thing and then you
44:29 hang up the phone and that always
44:30 happens but this particular time it was
44:33 a weird kind of tone of voice like he
44:36 didn't wanna be too loud in your car
44:37 because you're not where you're supposed
44:38 to be sort of thing I firmly believe
44:42 that you have the full capability of
44:44 analyzing any situation like that with
44:46 your consciousness and it will not feel
44:49 like this other outside process what I'm
44:52 really saying the black Apple comes from
44:55 is an involuntary process you're not
44:58 participating in this you're just
45:00 sitting there watching it it was
45:02 presented to you where they are head
45:05 down at night hopefully most of you
45:10 don't suffer from this but it happens I
45:12 think to everybody you know graduates
45:14 into life and you have your own world
45:16 your own bills and all that stuff I said
45:19 a long time ago in a dream episode and I
45:23 had one female comment or totally
45:27 acknowledge this and I was really I
45:32 guess I could say just super happy to
45:34 hear someone else acknowledge that this
45:36 is not something that only I experienced
45:41 but when you're laying down you will go
45:45 from consciousness into the twilight
45:47 zone and then into dream state Twilight
45:50 Zone is a is a real state of mind that's
45:53 why he chose the name of his show Rod
45:55 Serling when you are sort of halfway
45:57 between both realms the one thing that
46:00 it happens to me which I think could be
46:02 related to this similar situation and it
46:05 should be if we were in a scientific
46:06 situation we're writing all this down
46:08 and trying to get to the bottom of it
46:09 this would be definitely something that
46:11 needs to be in the paperwork I haven't
46:14 had it to have happened to me recently
46:15 and what's fascinating about this is as
46:18 soon as I acknowledged it on the show he
46:21 had almost evaporated completely in fact
46:23 I probably haven't had this for a couple
46:25 of years to be honest at least
46:26 consciously that I can remember so what
46:32 will happen is this as you're in the
46:34 twilight zone tucked away in your bed
46:36 wherever the hell you are going to bed
46:38 you will think of some people in your
46:42 real life it could be a person could be
46:44 a lot of people I think for me it
46:46 happens with one person but here's what
46:49 happens and it's really weird
46:51 your mind will instantaneously manifest
46:54 a backstory to this person it will tell
46:59 a story to you but this person and
47:04 usually for me it was always I owed them
47:07 something
47:08 I promised that we'd do something and I
47:10 did do it which is completely typical of
47:12 my behavior and so I would feel this
47:19 instantaneous sort of I don't know angst
47:22 that I let somebody down and it's a very
47:27 complex packet of storyline and it seems
47:31 to manifest itself literally in a split
47:33 second and then I'll wake up out of it
47:36 and you still this used to happen a lot
47:38 and I would just kind of push it away
47:39 without actually going whoa wait a
47:41 minute that wasn't even true okay and
47:43 when I started waking up love me not
47:46 that's a nice metaphor I started
47:49 realizing this wasn't true then I would
47:52 sit there in bed and I'd smile and go
47:54 that's not even happening right this
47:57 thing I'm worried about isn't even
47:59 happening it never happened so hurry I'm
48:03 having this incredible like flutter of
48:04 inks you know like if you do think about
48:07 your bills when you go through one of
48:09 those little valleys where money is not
48:11 coming in as steadily as you need it to
48:14 and maybe you got some in the bank but
48:15 you don't have enough to cover the next
48:16 month or whatever you're not sure where
48:18 you're getting your money from you will
48:21 think about loss and it becomes this
48:23 mega flutter in your system it's almost
48:25 like butterflies but they're not they're
48:27 sharp little butterfly wings right and
48:31 you'll just have a jolt and then you
48:34 realize oh I can't think about that if I
48:35 think about that I'm never going to bed
48:38 what I kept repeating in the alien
48:40 consciousness episode which I think is
48:43 important and you can say it all day
48:46 long you don't have to wait for this
48:49 thing to occur in order to give yourself
48:51 a little bit of comfort and I don't
48:54 think this is cowering out I don't think
48:55 this is being you're responsible with
49:02 your emotions whatsoever in fact I think
49:04 it's quite the antithesis right the
49:06 opposite you tell yourself when you're
49:10 getting especially we had a good morning
49:11 got some good sleep you go in your
49:13 bathroom you're gonna get all ready
49:14 spiffed up your perfect clothes are
49:16 clean right and you go in and you say
49:19 yourself every one small
49:21 not every thought I have are my thoughts
49:25 they're not sometimes they come from
49:28 this other source if you're religious
49:31 you know there's there's the great Metta
49:36 that the great analogy that we are
49:39 taught that the devil is there to mess
49:41 up your life and then usually before you
49:46 die if you live a fairly decent you know
49:48 length of a life you'll start to realize
49:50 it's not the devil sitting around going
49:53 big decision here big decision there
49:56 don't marry that person don't get that
49:58 job don't follow that goal well I'm sure
50:01 that happens too I've said this since I
50:05 was a teenager I said look it's that
50:06 little whisper in your ear that is
50:09 telling you go left go right it's a con
50:13 it seems like it has no context okay
50:16 I'll go left I'll go right
50:18 and again when I was following what was
50:20 at Walt Disney's pin to Bob ger in the
50:23 park that's exactly what I did but it
50:24 was sort of like this weird pull towards
50:26 him was strange but all those little
50:28 tiny things that are said to you over
50:30 time if you don't acknowledge that
50:32 they're not your thoughts you may take
50:34 some advice that ends up pushing you in
50:37 the wrong direction if you think about
50:39 it when you're young the world is
50:42 euphoric it's amazing you haven't
50:44 learned enough well one you don't have a
50:46 hell of a lot of responsibility but you
50:49 haven't been completely closed off to
50:52 the world you haven't seen the damage
50:54 that humans do to each other and so life
50:58 is a bowl of cherries for quite a while
51:00 hopefully as soon as you get out on your
51:03 own you got to get a job you got to pay
51:05 your bills you're trying to sort out all
51:06 the dreams that you have when you were
51:08 young you throw away some old dreams
51:10 because they were stupid because you
51:11 were young you make new ones when you're
51:13 older why is it that when people get
51:17 older they get cynical I heard that my
51:19 whole life
51:20 oh yeah he's an old cynical guy and I
51:23 said what does that mean you know oh
51:24 well sometimes when people get older
51:26 they think the whole world's falling
51:27 apart and everything's horrible no
51:29 country for old men sort of analogy and
51:32 this become you know
51:34 the old movie Greinke Oldman right was a
51:37 angry Oldman so what it is yeah and so
51:41 this this thing happens because the
51:44 world is at least in America it's
51:46 designed to change every 10 years or
51:48 whatever music you like this history you
51:51 know imagine imagine falling in love
51:54 with like Glenn Miller the Rat Pack Rat
52:00 Pack still gets played every once in a
52:01 while that olds smooth band music from
52:05 back in the 30s and 40s oh my gosh that
52:08 stuff is just beautiful when they did
52:10 the movie cocoon back in the day when I
52:12 was a little kid they played a lot of
52:13 that music and it just felt good you
52:15 know like man my father raised me with
52:17 that stuff because he was a trumpet
52:18 player so it wasn't new to me but it's
52:23 still just today feels great it just
52:25 changes your whole world when you listen
52:26 to really positive mega-talented music
52:29 like that so imagine everything that you
52:32 like changes you like those clothes that
52:35 you have in your closet from the 80's
52:38 90's or whatever and now if you wore
52:40 those in public you would be laughed out
52:42 of whatever room you walked into or you
52:45 know there's a sneaker and behind the
52:46 scenes at you hmm
52:49 what I'm getting at is that life gets
52:51 harder life challenges you I do think
52:55 we're supposed to grow you know if you
52:58 told a tomato plant when it's just put
53:00 another few little Leafs out the top of
53:03 the soil okay stop he's like what what
53:05 do you mean I haven't even made any
53:06 tomatoes yet and that's just stop just
53:09 stay right where you are a little guy be
53:11 pissed on he's like you know I get to be
53:13 a tomato plant right get to do my job
53:16 feed human beings with this offspring
53:18 called Tomatoes well we kind of kind of
53:22 we have to see our life's like that
53:23 every once in a while if we have a
53:26 creator of any any metaphorical type any
53:32 physical type whatever I'm sure that we
53:35 are supposed to grow learn and go
53:38 through these various journeys that's
53:39 why I say look and I know some of you
53:42 make choices not to do this and some of
53:45 you can't
53:46 so I don't mean to hurt anyone's
53:47 feelings but I think that a complete
53:50 human being is one they reached
53:54 self-realization over and over and over
53:57 again that just constantly grows you
53:59 find out who you are more and more as
54:00 time goes on it's just a journey it's a
54:02 beautiful thing your belief systems
54:04 change it might have been religious when
54:06 you were younger you went to science
54:08 then you came back to religion and
54:09 science mixed together and then you end
54:10 up something else at the end so I'm
54:11 nastic dude at the end but to conquer
54:16 the challenge of being with another
54:19 human being in a obviously it starts off
54:23 hopefully in some romantic way I know
54:25 some countries don't do that and I
54:26 respect that as long as they like what's
54:29 going on it's all good
54:31 but to then know flee make love then
54:36 make some babies and deal with young
54:38 children and then middle adults and then
54:41 see them become adults that's a whole
54:44 journey into itself as well it has a
54:46 whole bunch of dimension to the human
54:48 condition and then they have children
54:52 and you get to become a grandparent so
54:54 you get the joys of a kid and you're
54:57 really good at it at this point
54:58 hopefully but you don't have all the
55:00 tremendous responsibility and you know
55:03 some folks help raise their grandkids
55:06 straight up in their house you know he'd
55:08 go to work honey I'm retired I'll take
55:10 care of the kids during the day until
55:11 they old enough to drive cars and do
55:13 whatever they want and you just have
55:15 this nice little beautiful thing they
55:16 look like you a little bit you see
55:18 yourself and them you see they're your
55:20 in-laws in them you see your kids in
55:22 them it's just cool and you see they're
55:24 holding their whole unique pattern
55:25 they're different than everybody you've
55:26 ever met they're wiser than you
55:28 sometimes right and then of course the
55:32 final chapter hopefully you you're with
55:36 someone in my opinion I think that would
55:38 be the best part but one of you is gonna
55:40 probably pass away before the other one
55:42 you got to deal with that and that's
55:44 sort of a McCobb moment but it's also
55:47 sort of one of these moments where you
55:49 appreciate life the most when you lose
55:52 somebody right and then it's your time
55:55 to go and hopefully you have a system of
55:59 belief that will give
56:00 you a wonderful feeling as you journey
56:02 out from this world and maybe go meet
56:06 God they meet all the other spirits
56:08 maybe come back again do this over maybe
56:11 take a little break in the green room in
56:13 between scenes maybe get to pick who
56:17 you're gonna be next maybe that's the
56:19 case maybe Shirley MacLaine's right if
56:21 nothing else the black apple distracts
56:25 you from your life it's I most of you
56:32 have cell phones you've experienced this
56:35 and hopefully most the time it's funny
56:37 but she'll be tabbing away on your phone
56:40 and someone will walk up to you and put
56:43 their fingers all of your phone and
56:44 click a bunch of buttons to move things
56:46 around just to mess with you maybe they
56:48 think you're on your phone too much and
56:50 they're just you know they're just
56:51 ganking you they're having fun right and
56:53 you're like oh what are you doing you
56:56 know or you're building something and
56:58 they knock part of it down or whatever
56:59 they set you back now within that
57:02 context it could be funny hopefully but
57:06 do we want anything to to set us back
57:09 any further than life sets us back in
57:12 general I don't think so now if you're
57:17 able to manifest a philosophy of life
57:19 where you take all those delays and all
57:21 those interruptions and you can learn
57:22 something from it all and it's all
57:24 positive then man you have evolved way
57:26 beyond my genetics you know for me I
57:30 want to wake up get my agenda together
57:33 of all the things I'm working on which
57:35 are always half a dozen or more a bunch
57:38 of that are almost endless in their in
57:40 their requests and their need for me to
57:42 nurture them like writing a script or
57:46 building some really complex piece of
57:48 software or something but then you know
57:51 I want to be in control I don't want to
57:52 lose my day I mean imagine you have one
57:54 of these weird projections that happens
57:56 to you the first thing when you wake up
57:58 in the morning you've been separated
58:00 from your lover and nobody wants that to
58:03 ever happen but every time you wake up
58:05 alone you're like oh my god maybe you
58:07 lost so many your life that you love and
58:08 that's just like right to your chest
58:10 right
58:12 but you want to in my opinion to catch
58:14 up to this take control deal with the
58:18 emotion that's there and then get back
58:21 onto your day and to be as productive as
58:23 you can possibly be
58:25 just let me throw this this other
58:28 mechanism at you that might work I
58:30 haven't tried this personally but it
58:32 makes sense based on some of the things
58:35 that we've really studied about the mind
58:37 there's I could probably make an episode
58:41 on this but be boring as hell all by
58:44 itself there's a lot of books out there
58:47 that say that we actually don't
58:48 multitask as human beings we do what's
58:51 called the round robin where we go in a
58:54 circle constantly in our brain now
58:56 sometimes it's so fast that it feels
58:59 like we're multitasking but we truly you
59:02 know some autistic people can do it true
59:04 autistic Rainman kids can do this
59:06 they've got multiple consciousness is
59:08 running at the same time basically two
59:10 or more processors doing something at
59:13 the same exact time so let's just say
59:17 that we we are relegated to one process
59:20 at a time all right
59:23 let's say that you are haunted by a
59:27 suspicion it is this projection you've
59:30 heard this episode you're aware of it
59:32 but you're finding it a little difficult
59:35 to take back control uh-huh have you
59:40 ever been so busy you can't think about
59:42 anything else but the thing you're
59:43 working on it's a positive thing oh my
59:46 gosh I just someone's like man you
59:48 haven't called me in like a week or so
59:49 in my office oh sorry I never even
59:51 thought about hurting your feelings
59:52 because I'm so into this project I never
59:55 even thought about making the phone call
59:57 happens to me all the time people who
60:01 know me well most often go where did you
60:04 go I think I get that all the time oh my
60:07 god but in my house I'm like Willy Wonka
60:09 dude nobody comes in nobody comes out I
60:13 think God that won't balloon pose make
60:15 good chocolate
60:15 jeez but what if one of the techniques
60:18 to mess with this is you fill your
60:24 processor
60:25 you overwhelm it with one of two things
60:30 perhaps it is something positive you're
60:32 working on but maybe you know so I just
60:36 told you that if I told you about myself
60:38 that if something's really racking me it
60:40 will disturb my ability to write a
60:42 screenplay because I need to be
60:44 completely at peace with myself to
60:46 really sneak in the theater and really
60:47 you know mulch ideas right so what I
60:54 will do next time I have anything
60:57 overwhelming which because I've taken
60:59 control this mechanism I don't get this
61:01 anymore folks so I want to give you this
61:04 gift if this is something that's it's
61:06 messing with you or if it reoccurs right
61:09 but like I said when I first opened this
61:11 episode I said how do you give yourself
61:15 the controlling experiment to notice
61:18 this other accusation and philosophy
61:21 hypothesis that the stuff comes from the
61:23 outside you say something from the heart
61:26 it's something true I love apple pie
61:30 love it I love Dairy Queen I love my
61:33 relatives I love my friends I love deep
61:36 thoughts radio and so if I were to not
61:41 be able to push out one of these visions
61:43 which for me the the chronology is
61:46 always I'm just sitting around and a lot
61:49 of times that will happen to me when I'm
61:51 waking up in bed right because I'll go
61:52 through checking into social media
61:54 checking into whatever emails listen to
61:57 voicemails check my iPad play a couple
62:00 little games and then I'm up and I've
62:04 just sort of updated my brain I looked
62:07 at the news whatever and that thing will
62:11 happen between me getting out of bed and
62:13 walking into my bathroom it's that quick
62:15 just boom something weird happens in
62:18 fact last time it happened that's
62:20 exactly where it happened for me and I
62:22 walked in my bathroom and I'm open in my
62:24 window and in the warm air getting
62:26 everything all set up and I just said
62:27 you know those aren't my thoughts and I
62:32 have to give the person who was involved
62:34 in that thought all the benefits of
62:39 my love for them but they wouldn't be
62:42 that kind of person or wouldn't have
62:43 them in my life if they work right have
62:46 you ever been having a conversation
62:47 where it was just it's just a city crate
62:51 you just like look man I don't want to
62:52 talk about Hillary Clinton anymore I
62:54 don't want to talk about queueing on
62:55 anymore or any of this political crap
62:57 it's not that I'm not interested it's
62:58 just I've had too much of it recently
63:00 right and so you changed the subject and
63:04 my advice is to if you're talking to
63:06 someone else which is usually the way
63:08 this happens definitely say look it's
63:11 not like we can't talk about this I'm
63:13 totally open to your ideas and
63:15 everything but right now I just had a
63:17 one of those days I had one of those
63:19 weeks or whatever this content you know
63:22 I'm Aiman location B this is location a
63:25 and B talks about all the time so I'm
63:27 really trying to escape from B can we
63:29 just watch some baseball smoke some
63:31 cigars watch an old movie boom and
63:35 that's how you shut it down and
63:37 immediately you feel better when that
63:39 happens so you can do that completely by
63:43 yourself now another subject that I
63:46 can't do a whole episode on but I got
63:48 plenty of cigar to talk about it there
63:50 comes your bonus round is this notion of
63:55 talking to yourself
63:57 some people get spooked out by it
63:59 I shared a child with another human
64:02 being of course and her mother was
64:05 always with two brothers and so the
64:08 household was never quiet and so there
64:11 was never any need to entertain yourself
64:15 and I think when you're an only child
64:17 this starts to happen and I think this
64:21 is where people like me materialized now
64:24 you you can't have obviously real large
64:25 families where because they're always
64:28 talking to themselves I've heard of
64:29 plenty of stories of people I met that
64:31 say I was always up in my room by myself
64:35 and so you can't have that same
64:37 development within a family it's just
64:39 more unique usually it's like when you
64:42 get two four kids this this little
64:44 isolation routine starts to be possible
64:47 right but my kids mother when she was
64:50 young said don't talk to yourself
64:53 only crazy people talk to themselves
64:55 obviously there's a bit of a vocational
64:58 gap there but it always stuck with me
65:02 because it heard me that my kick came
65:04 back and said that to me and I told her
65:06 right off the bat that's not true don't
65:08 worry about that
65:09 that's her vision of that she didn't do
65:11 that when she was a kid
65:12 just understand her perspective maybe
65:15 look over your shoulder if she can hear
65:18 you when you do it to yourself right
65:19 when you do it with yourself right
65:21 there's something extremely interesting
65:23 for the human mind and really it it
65:25 pertains to how we perceive our souls
65:27 and that little tiny three-letter word
65:29 called sin this is where it gains a lot
65:34 of context let's just say that much you
65:37 will fear let's just say you have a
65:41 daydream it's your dream you're putting
65:43 the characters in you're controlling the
65:44 scenario in your mind and you know for
65:50 males like your typical alpha male
65:53 protector you will I mean this happens
65:57 to me more than I'd like to admit it
65:59 your protector and so if you're with
66:02 your family or just by yourself even but
66:04 you see vulnerability and the restaurant
66:06 or something we have so much of this
66:09 gangster mentality horseshit right and
66:12 most these guys are their nicest people
66:14 on planet Earth you just as soon as you
66:16 talk to them they're mean face turns to
66:17 a funny face and now you're in their
66:19 clique and it's all good and they're an
66:21 ally they're you're part of your your
66:24 clan right even if you don't know and
66:27 I'll give you an example I'll give you a
66:29 real world example between my house and
66:31 the restaurant I go to every day for
66:33 lunch there was a new guy we have a big
66:38 street big long street they takes us to
66:40 the main intersection we'll return out
66:41 and start heading on the main roads but
66:44 there was this guy very formidable
66:47 looking walking his dog which looked
66:51 very formidable looking right down the
66:54 middle of the street we have beautiful
66:56 sidewalks on both sides and he would
67:00 just challenge every car so every car
67:03 con he wouldn't move and I had this
67:06 happen when I
67:06 the space shuttle into your California
67:08 there's a hundred thousand people
67:10 watching the space shuttle and
67:11 everyone's trying to leave and all the
67:13 highways are out straight and it was
67:15 this big blockage like everything was
67:20 going slow and I was like what the hell
67:21 is going on and finally I get up to the
67:24 the blockage and it's this chick I don't
67:27 know what she was but she she's kind of
67:30 kind of like she's very tan she's
67:33 wearing a bathing suit top full chaps
67:36 and she's riding an Indian motorcycle
67:38 with the big fat tire in the front right
67:40 and she's just hanging on to this bike
67:43 and just telling everyone get the [ __ ]
67:44 out of my way
67:45 and this carnie y con a callus occupying
67:48 her with the banana seat on this thing
67:50 he was just kind of behind her like yep
67:52 she's in charge was hilarious so this
67:55 guy was doing the same thing and I'm
67:58 thinking well we got a mrs. Orange
68:01 County man we can't just have this kind
68:04 of element do its thing
68:07 bus will have you know ten squad car
68:10 SWAT cars on this guy in ten seconds if
68:12 we even reported this was happening it's
68:14 just the way it rolls around here you
68:16 behave so what this this towns all about
68:18 right was County of Orange County and we
68:21 do behave if it's great so anyway I
68:24 passed him up last week and I finally
68:28 just pulled over I've been in pull over
68:30 I stopped you know right next to him in
68:32 the road and I rolled down my window and
68:35 it was kind of like well [ __ ] you know
68:37 and I said I said why are you walking in
68:40 the middle of the street and he was like
68:43 oh because I try to keep the dog off the
68:48 sidewalk and I said why do you try to
68:50 keep the dog on the sidewalk and he says
68:52 well soon as he's on the sidewalk he
68:54 wants to stop and pee and poop and I
68:57 don't want him to right now cuz he's
68:58 like training this dog and he didn't he
69:02 said he was basically gave me an
69:04 explanation which said he was training
69:05 the dog and I said well you a dog
69:07 trainer and he's like well sorta and I
69:10 said we'll are you from around here like
69:12 you live right oh no I live around the
69:14 street or around the corner over there I
69:16 couldn't quite place it in my brain
69:17 turns out to be one of the nicest guys
69:20 big old smile his face he had a very
69:23 interesting name it was almost like my
69:25 day but that's the girl's name but it
69:27 was something like that my tan or
69:29 something like that and so I shake his
69:31 hand you know I'm like hey well good to
69:33 see I haven't seen him since but he now
69:36 understands he's being noticed for doing
69:38 this weird thing but he had a reason and
69:40 it made sense in a way that he was like
69:43 this dog is not trained and I don't want
69:45 him just ruling the dog walking
69:47 experience by saying I'm gonna smell
69:49 this one a peeing on that and do this by
69:51 walking him down this tree had nothing
69:52 to mess with
69:53 this is a guide a good explanation but
69:56 here's the problem in the days that I
69:58 passed him beforehand it really angered
70:01 me that this this intrusion into the
70:04 street was going on because just leave
70:07 room for two cars and if there's a lot
70:09 of times we had like two or three cars
70:10 and we're driving trying to drive around
70:11 this guy and of course my brain he's
70:14 he's an [ __ ] and he's he thinks he's
70:16 gonna muscle in with this gangster
70:18 mentality horseshit and it ain't gonna
70:20 fly it ain't gonna fly Susan met the guy
70:22 a race but I had to take you know my
70:27 projection mechanism gave me all these
70:29 scenarios of what kind of person he was
70:31 I judged him I was totally wrong once I
70:35 met him and let truth happen talking to
70:40 him was truth my brain this projection
70:42 mechanism I took the black cap when I
70:44 went oh that's who he is
70:46 oh my gosh we're gonna take care of that
70:48 guy ridiculous ridiculous I was ashamed
70:51 of myself and so this will happen in
70:54 public places where someone's pretending
70:56 to be hard and they're pretending to be
70:57 art guys are big cowards inside big
71:00 chickens inside doesn't mean they you
71:03 know can't throw down and knock the crap
71:05 out of you it's just that's why they're
71:07 so sensitive is that they're afraid and
71:10 so what's interesting about is when you
71:12 see the public and you see this this
71:15 hard element in America in California
71:18 it's all over the place right you got
71:20 the scrawniest kids on planet Earth
71:22 walking around like you know I don't
71:26 know like they're he-man or something
71:29 it's really strange and you're just like
71:30 god you're one flight away from maybe
71:34 crawling under a rock your whole life
71:35 because you realize you just don't have
71:38 it kid you know just be funny be you
71:41 know charismatic with your life and
71:43 you'll never worry about anything you'll
71:44 avoid all conflict because you're the
71:47 center of the party man
71:48 everyone's looking forward to you coming
71:49 you know but what was doing that to me
71:54 what does it to me in public and there's
71:57 a lot of you dudes here exactly the same
71:58 way women you're exactly the same way
72:01 but you may not take an aggressive
72:04 stance with threats you take a get the
72:07 hell out of Dodge
72:08 you know stance I can only grab my kids
72:10 and get them out of here you know and
72:12 most of us should take that stance it's
72:14 the usually the best best case right
72:16 don't sit and sit around trying to be
72:17 mr. tough guy because it often won't
72:20 work out rain it's always somebody
72:22 bigger so we all know we have instincts
72:25 and you know it was my a good friend of
72:31 mine who shared with me a very
72:34 challenging moment in her life and the
72:37 saddest part was I've mentioned this
72:39 once before but we no one knew she was
72:41 going through this experience because
72:43 the first thing that happened to her was
72:45 she ran out of money and the first thing
72:47 as a result of running out of money was
72:49 her cell phone died
72:51 she couldn't pay for the bill she
72:53 couldn't contact any of us she couldn't
72:55 even well I don't know she might have
72:58 been able to power it up drag the
72:59 numbers out and then make a phone call
73:01 through a payphone or something or you
73:02 someone else a cell phone but she was a
73:04 she is a very tough formidable woman who
73:09 just you know her attitudes I'll take
73:12 care of it because she always has but
73:16 she shared with me an experience where
73:18 my god I think she actually told me like
73:21 for weeks she was in Los Angeles just in
73:26 the heart of Los Angeles okay and she
73:29 said I got she took pictures of herself
73:31 after she recovered and I saw her she
73:34 was already not she's perfectly fit
73:36 let's put that weigh-in in a normal
73:38 situation she's absolutely beautiful
73:41 perfect amazing human being physically
73:43 but she took pictures of herself when
73:45 she got back on her feet and she had
73:47 so much weight it was like scary super
73:51 scary to see her thin arms and I stuff
73:53 today she's doing fantastic so she did
73:56 take care of it it was awesome
73:57 but she finally called me and told me
73:59 that this had happened to her and I'm
74:01 like what are you doing is that you
74:03 should have called me I would have come
74:05 and picked you up because I lived at my
74:06 house like just relax you know I mean
74:08 you're you're one of those gold people
74:09 in the world that we all should protect
74:11 you know and she just sits like you know
74:13 our role it was like yeah don't let that
74:16 happen again all right so then her and I
74:19 started talking a lot so I could get her
74:20 and make sure she was on her feet and we
74:22 went through a lot of issues that we
74:23 both mediated and it all worked out it
74:25 was awesome but she said she got so
74:27 hungry that she walked into a restaurant
74:30 and just in the most feral State that
74:35 she could possibly be in she just said
74:36 give me food I am dying
74:40 give me food give me a drink give me
74:43 anything and I think they assisted her
74:47 because he didn't look threatening or
74:49 anything but what I heard that it it
74:54 really broke my heart that I wasn't able
74:57 to help somebody I really loved you know
74:59 as a friend but when she told me that
75:02 she revealed you know that that instinct
75:05 she goes look I wasn't even thinking
75:06 straight my creative mind disappeared my
75:10 my empathy mind and sympathy mine just
75:13 turned off I had not enough nutrition in
75:15 my mind to feed my burning the basics
75:17 but what was interesting was our brain
75:19 functioned at a level to get food and
75:23 it's interesting and it's it's sort of I
75:26 guess you could say heartwarming to know
75:28 that our our brains are wired so
75:30 perfectly from our Creator that that is
75:34 the way that we work we go down to the
75:36 feral basics of our strategic resources
75:38 which are food to be able to get what we
75:41 need now imagine one some of this
75:48 defense mechanism thing
75:50 thus the proxy to this projection
75:54 mechanism being very powerful over you
75:56 is to be out of sorts or the basic
76:01 instinct
76:01 of your instincts to survive and make
76:04 sure that again tough guys walking down
76:07 the street with the dog looks like they
76:08 eat your mom don't believe that they can
76:11 just do that because then maybe there's
76:13 too one day and then three one day and
76:15 it's just like wow we lost control of
76:17 our neighborhood neighborhoods are like
76:19 that all over the place and in tougher
76:21 areas right if the first kid who hit a
76:23 corner to sell drugs was immediately
76:25 detained and every single time someone
76:27 tried to take his place the cops are
76:29 right there then it probably would have
76:30 never manifested but you know what
76:33 happens no one even thinks about that
76:34 even being the case before they dealt
76:37 drugs and nobody thought someone would
76:38 stand outside selling it you know it's
76:41 like some back door thing right so there
76:44 might be situations where if we don't
76:46 keep ourselves well-fed well-nourished
76:50 that you know we have the same hangry
76:53 you're so hungry you're in a bad mood
76:56 I always chalk up hangry to our
77:00 instincts your and I always go back to a
77:04 tribal example how did we used to eat I
77:09 mean 200 years ago this was the case for
77:12 virtually every American you went out
77:15 and you hunted something and you killed
77:17 it and you cleaned it and you prepared
77:21 it some things you dried out some things
77:24 you eat right away but what does it take
77:27 to kill an animal well it takes a state
77:30 of mind doesn't it aside from skills and
77:33 tools it takes a state of mind like I
77:37 mentioned the episode I made yesterday
77:39 which I've got so many in the queue now
77:41 I don't know which one's going to go out
77:42 first so hopefully you've already seen
77:44 the other episode its evolution
77:46 evolution 2.0 or visit revisit or
77:48 whatever you know they tell these kids
77:53 and they've done this for thousands of
77:55 years you cannot become a man in this
77:57 tribe in Africa unless you go out and
77:59 hunt a lion a male lion by yourself so
78:02 the thing with the mane right it's big I
78:05 mean you see they're they're little
78:07 trucks man I mean they're big they're
78:09 horses right but you have to
78:13 see what you're not going to get as a
78:15 result of not killing this thing in
78:19 order to have the rational thought of
78:20 like well I want to get married I want
78:22 to make love to a woman and I can't have
78:24 that unless I kill this lion and so
78:26 you're gonna stand out there until you
78:27 get it right or you get killed or eaten
78:30 alive right you imagine all the
78:32 snowflakes we have today if they had to
78:34 do that unreal but you're hangry because
78:37 I think in your body is transforming
78:40 into this more monstrous form because in
78:43 the past just 200 years ago you're like
78:46 I need food and I'm gonna be really
78:50 monstrous and and aggressive until I get
78:53 that food and that's gonna feed into
78:56 your abilities to be able to go out
78:58 there and you know you're hungry looking
79:00 at a boar that if it hits you with its
79:02 tusks will set your leg leg back good
79:05 two or three weeks right you can't get
79:08 to water and also other stuff it's a bad
79:10 deal so it's you against the animal and
79:13 you're gonna conquer it and that's where
79:16 that instinctual thing comes from so as
79:20 we realize the black apples there and
79:22 it's going to be there until we
79:24 acknowledge it I think and then you just
79:25 you can almost complete separate from it
79:27 but if it continues to occur you know do
79:31 me a favor figure out the science of
79:33 what state of mind you're in are you
79:35 super happy because that's what I run
79:37 into is I'm very happy with my life and
79:39 I'm open to thoughts and this negative
79:42 stuff pops in I'm just like whoa
79:45 you know and one good thing about
79:47 keeping your life happy is that when
79:49 negativity arrives the boy sticks out
79:51 like a sore thumb it sticks out like the
79:53 black sheep you can immediately go right
79:55 there that is that shouldn't be here
79:57 that isn't even me it's not me I don't
80:00 have these kind of thoughts get out of
80:01 your boom I won't I won't let you come
80:04 in here devil or demon and accuse my
80:07 friends at things that they don't do
80:09 especially my loved ones my lovers or
80:11 whatever right boom you're out of here
80:12 and you clean the slate but now what
80:16 happens if we're already pretty pissed
80:18 off and a lot of things or depressed
80:19 about a lot of things and the legitimate
80:23 things
80:25 well now the things on top of you and
80:27 it's just one more flavor gets to sneak
80:29 in another you know what all the apples
80:32 are really dark but this one just
80:33 happens to be pure black the other ones
80:35 are pretty dark too not the same thing
80:38 one of them is an empirical truth about
80:40 your life you don't like your job in a
80:42 weird relationship whatever you don't
80:45 have more you know the kind of money you
80:46 need to do what you need to do you got
80:47 an illness that you don't understand you
80:49 can't get it to just go away you still
80:52 have to be vigilant because we don't
80:55 want to give this mechanism any more
81:00 ability to rule our lives right now let
81:05 me digress away from or you know lead in
81:08 from that off to just something that
81:10 happened to me which I I think I
81:13 mentioned three years ago might be
81:15 valuable to recap it here because it's
81:18 one of my own personal experiences and
81:21 because it was very atypical of me this
81:24 experience and it lasted geez like I
81:27 think I lasted almost a year I was in a
81:30 new relationship that was fantastic my
81:33 kid was awesome lived in a great place I
81:36 was making plenty of money had every toy
81:39 in the world man I was head of music
81:41 studios cranking out stuff constantly
81:43 didn't stuff professionally on the side
81:45 so life was good the problem was my main
81:48 job that I had taken with the startup my
81:51 first probably my first web startup okay
81:54 it was a cool company had a lot of great
81:56 employees but the sales guy was making
82:00 my life hell selling things that didn't
82:02 exist when I say they didn't exist he
82:05 was selling stuff that didn't exist
82:06 anywhere on the web was 1998 and 98 99
82:12 strike really towards the end of 98
82:14 towards the beginning of 99 got super
82:18 super bad about February 99 and I know
82:22 because I got my full-time gig at EA
82:25 finally in April first of all things
82:29 1999 I'm contracting for G's I guess six
82:35 years before that it's doing all kinds
82:37 of stuff for those folks
82:38 and I would just go to work and it was
82:44 like no matter if I finished something
82:45 the guy would promise more features that
82:47 didn't exist and I was like who the hell
82:49 hired this guy who is keeping this he
82:52 would determine my my he would sell the
82:55 whole thing with a finished and
82:56 deployment date without ever talking to
82:57 me
82:58 he was completely non-technical I mean I
83:01 appreciate being pushed but Jesus crisis
83:04 was nuts he was selling bulletin boards
83:07 and one ad bulletin boards that just
83:11 didn't exist man so I would go home at
83:14 night and when I went to bed the only
83:18 way I could dream about going or sorry
83:21 get myself to go to bed and get have a
83:23 dream I guess just fall asleep so not
83:27 really trying to say was that I kept
83:31 seeing myself jump off the World Trade
83:34 Centers and I don't even think about
83:37 those buildings I didn't even know they
83:38 were called World Trade Centers I just
83:40 knew there was two big square buildings
83:42 in New York and I would just see myself
83:44 looking over New York and I would just
83:46 jump and it wasn't me trying to kill
83:50 myself in any way shape or form it was
83:53 just that once I do this that guy
83:57 doesn't have any control over my life
83:58 anymore
83:58 it was weird right and so I was very
84:03 fortunate that everything else was going
84:04 really well in my life and I didn't have
84:06 to have all this negative projection but
84:09 man I had this been on me really heavily
84:12 in those eras who knows what I would
84:15 have believed I had no mechanism to
84:17 recognize the difference so someone
84:20 tries to say okay that's just your it'd
84:23 screaming from the inside freaking you
84:25 out
84:26 mm-hmm again maybe but if I have one
84:30 tomorrow morning it will be the weirdest
84:35 contrast between my overall frequency of
84:37 life which is mega positive I mean I'm
84:42 super happy with my life super happy
84:44 with my life anything ever happens to me
84:45 you can definitely chalk it up some
84:48 epstein thing so if I have it now which
84:51 I have had it
84:52 last you know I said it had that had to
84:54 head it in a while
84:55 had a little one the other day and I had
84:57 just laughed it off getting into my
84:59 shower I'm thinking isn't that funny
85:02 that that would ever present itself I'd
85:04 even think about the subject matter of
85:05 the thing I can't remember what it was
85:06 but it was accusing someone I knew of
85:08 something and it was just silly it was
85:10 just dumb so if you think this is
85:14 something and only happens when you are
85:16 down and out
85:18 I can I can attest to the opposite
85:22 I can also test that it becomes
85:24 measurably easier to extinguish this
85:28 effect on you if you are positive I mean
85:32 if you're in a good state and you're in
85:33 your life now some of us use fear as
85:37 attacked to to pay attention and to get
85:41 what we want and that's I think a very
85:44 specific thing that you do that you
85:46 might be able to cannibalize this
85:48 negative stuff to give yourself more
85:50 fear to motivate yourself
85:52 my suggestion is even though that's a
85:55 low hanging sort of lowbrow
85:57 technique of getting yourself motivated
86:01 let me suggest you don't do that always
86:05 try to fix things through the Tony
86:07 Robbins technique which is associate
86:10 true negativity with all the addictions
86:12 that you have in life that are ruining
86:14 your life that are taking away your life
86:15 and try to focus on your goals and see
86:21 them clearly and like like most people
86:23 say try to figure out the steps it takes
86:24 to get to the next minor goal that is in
86:27 line with the big goal and you know your
86:29 life will automatically start getting
86:31 better more that things start to occur
86:33 that are positive you know but look at
86:38 the other thing that Tony Robbins says
86:40 which i think is just utterly brilliant
86:42 which is your brain will automatically
86:44 filter out negativity and move away from
86:46 for the negativity and it will always
86:48 invest in things that are associated
86:51 with positivity that's just the way your
86:54 brain works how awesome it's your little
86:57 gyroscope inside that will always
86:59 upright you from a negative emotion but
87:01 the problem is okay
87:04 that if you're what they call a comfort
87:07 eater let's just say you're becoming
87:10 obese because food has been falsely
87:14 classified in your mind as a positive I
87:17 try to keep food as non recreational as
87:22 possible in my life and I mean what I'd
87:25 like to do is like every quarter of a
87:27 year go to some restaurant that blows my
87:29 mind and then it's like ok this is a
87:31 very special thing even save up for this
87:33 reservation sometimes unnecessary and so
87:36 these these positive things occur but I
87:39 have friends I've got one close friend
87:40 who really struggles with their weight
87:43 and they know it and they've got these
87:46 sayings they got the sayings of death
87:48 well I'm just a comfort eater
87:50 oh does that make you feel good does
87:53 that make it all go away aren't you
87:55 tired and I'm never being able to run
87:57 anywhere of constantly having to buy new
87:59 clothes because your body gets bigger
88:00 and bigger and bigger and this is no
88:01 exaggeration and so what that person
88:05 needs to do is associate with the
88:08 comfort eating catchphrase that's
88:10 allowing all this obesity to occur which
88:12 is gonna eventually in 20 years turn
88:14 into really bad physical problems
88:16 argument organs will cease to work
88:18 properly and you'll start to have all
88:19 these issues right who wants that you
88:21 know it's also the world's opinion of
88:24 you like I always say if someone doesn't
88:27 take care of their temple then what are
88:29 they going to take care of outside their
88:31 own life and help how much are they
88:33 gonna pay attention to it now I know a
88:34 lot of geniuses that are overweight but
88:38 it's always sort of like well they're
88:40 eventually going to expire too soon you
88:42 know some people are built big I'm not
88:44 talking about that
88:45 the folks that are definitely you know
88:48 when they hit 18 to 25 they were 130
88:51 pounds and five foot four and now
88:53 they're nearly 250 pounds and you're
88:56 like you're never supposed to be this
88:58 big but what the last part of that
89:01 puzzle is to imagine the beauty of
89:04 reaching your end goal everything in
89:07 life that'll be better if you get that
89:10 end goal and it doesn't matter how crazy
89:11 the goal is right I'm writing films with
89:15 the hope they'll get sold and made
89:17 is there anything crazier than that if
89:19 you knew how hard it is in Hollywood to
89:20 sell the script that's one of the
89:23 hardest things you can do in the entire
89:24 world you have you really really good at
89:28 your craft to pull that off okay for me
89:32 other than physical in abilities you
89:35 know I'm never gonna be a lineman in an
89:38 NFL team it'll never happen in this
89:42 lifetime as with as per the years I've
89:44 got left it would have happened earlier
89:45 either but I'm just not big enough
89:49 I'm not big enough to do that I mean was
89:52 that guy got his leg snapped the other
89:54 day in the NFL's layoff I would be a
89:57 little tiny twig for these folks okay
89:59 Ben anyway if I could get my friend to
90:02 envision how amazing it is to look in a
90:06 full-length mirror fit and this person's
90:11 gorgeous right it's a female she's
90:15 gorgeous and if she ever got back to
90:17 like your body matches your face thing
90:19 papow what couldn't you do in life once
90:22 you rid yourself of that weight going
90:24 through that whole Rubicon of of
90:26 changing your eating habits see see the
90:31 the desserts and all that stuff that
90:33 makes you fat see that as the devil see
90:38 that as the negativity that it really is
90:40 I hate to spoil it with you know for you
90:43 but like the food industry is obviously
90:46 trying to make you love everything love
90:48 those Starbucks coffee Starbucks is the
90:50 worst [ __ ] coffee on planet earth
90:51 that's why they make it so chocolaty and
90:54 so whipped cream because you're drinking
90:57 swill underneath this coffee I mean
90:59 underneath all the added stuff to it
91:01 they have to they have to dress up this
91:03 totally acidic acid reflux crap they
91:07 sell you know you can go to other places
91:10 and it's much better and then you won't
91:14 need all that decoration on your food
91:16 but they're trying to make you addicted
91:18 to this you have to see the movie
91:20 branded which will marry this entire
91:22 episode beautifully an alien race that
91:26 there are species that lives on planet
91:28 Earth that drives all the brand loyal
91:31 see in the world because all it's trying
91:33 to do is get you to fall in love with
91:35 your with your lust for things and the
91:38 second you gain the item the alien
91:40 breaks off from you and takes that lust
91:42 bubble you add gives it to the
91:43 mothership it's it's on point it's
91:47 beautiful and it will change your mind
91:50 but inside that movie like I've said
91:51 several times they tried to sell fat to
91:53 everybody they literally had a
91:55 conference room meeting and said we are
91:58 going to sell fat and then they ran all
92:00 these commercials of these obese kids
92:02 given food to each other being all sexy
92:04 about it if obesity was only just a
92:08 fashion statement and didn't lead to
92:10 catastrophic organ failure and you know
92:14 starting fires and your jeans down by
92:16 your thighs I probably wouldn't have any
92:18 concern about it but it is
92:21 I see people suffer from it constantly
92:23 suffer from it in ways that I can't even
92:26 describe on this show it's too too vivid
92:29 and too gross that they these things
92:31 they have to do on a daily basis these
92:33 are people that I know and so I don't
92:38 want that for anybody why would I want
92:40 that for anybody I want you to be
92:41 totally and completely in control of
92:44 your brain of your mind it is your
92:47 sovereign place of existence I want you
92:49 to get what you want in life and there's
92:52 a lot of lessons and a lot of things
92:53 that may apply to you and some things I
92:56 talked about the don't apply to you yet
92:57 or may never ever be useful to you but
93:00 just having you know every tool in the
93:02 tool shed well then you could make
93:04 anything that you want
93:05 you set the materials and the will a
93:09 envision your goal complete envision all
93:12 the benefits of that goal being
93:13 completed if you want fame okay here's
93:16 the fastest way to get Fame do something
93:19 that you love better than anybody else
93:22 or at least you're up there at that
93:24 echelon with everybody else but because
93:26 we are artists and human beings at the
93:28 same exact time the way you do it's
93:30 going to be different than the way
93:31 everyone else does so even if someone is
93:33 as talented as you they're doing a
93:35 Picasso you're doing a Salvador Dali
93:37 someone's gonna buy your stuff if they
93:40 like it I always cite Steve Jobs and
93:43 he's
93:43 so it's because he made what he loved
93:45 and you loved it too same with Wozniak
93:47 he made a computer that he wanted to use
93:49 he made it okay
93:52 they picked the chips out they put this
93:54 thing together Wozniak wrote the basic
93:56 for it
93:57 that guy was ridiculously brilliant be
94:01 your own Wozniak you know be your own
94:04 genius the beautiful thing is is like
94:08 you know if I came up to you and said is
94:12 a funny little analogy but if I came up
94:15 to you and said stop thinking that what
94:18 whatever is making you smile something
94:21 in it you're like why what are you
94:23 talking about
94:24 well I don't want you to be happy what
94:26 are you widen to and be happy because
94:27 I'm not happy no one's allowed to be
94:30 happy it's like the Vogon captain
94:32 because I've just had an unhappy love
94:34 affair so I don't see why anyone else
94:36 should be having a good time
94:37 hilarious right well you wouldn't let me
94:40 and you think I was a jerk and you think
94:42 was wrong with me
94:43 but we're doing that to ourselves half
94:45 the time are we you know why can't you
94:49 dream about your goals in life why can't
94:51 you go get it yeah it'll be hard but
94:55 guess what
94:56 anybody who's one up and grabbed a
94:58 statue off some awards ceremony that
95:00 they respect you just like Sally feels
95:04 you know you like me you really like me
95:07 no one should have laughed at her she's
95:10 right that's what she wanted in life she
95:13 wanted to be approved of by the world
95:16 and she got the award now she was
95:18 already loved by the world by the time
95:20 she finished probably her first two
95:22 films but for whatever reason she
95:24 carried that all the way to the 90s when
95:26 she grabbed the Oscar I guess it was and
95:28 and she hey finally got what she wanted
95:31 she wanted that statue that statue was
95:33 the definitive moment in her career
95:36 unfortunately she embarrassed herself a
95:38 little bit but again she was just
95:40 speaking her mind we're all thinking it
95:42 she just said it so she gets to be the
95:45 criminal in the social mores of the
95:49 world and were we're okay because we'd
95:51 never gotten the statue never had the
95:52 emotion anyway I think you feel me on
95:55 this one please
95:57 babies are long or anything if you
95:59 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
96:00 that's the place to find everything two
96:04 options for video two options for audio
96:07 two options for social media I always
96:10 stop and say look are locked Facebook
96:12 group is a great place to be make sure
96:14 you get out there our membership has
96:16 actually been extremely low recently and
96:19 but the views on YouTube have been
96:21 amazing if you want to know for Shadow
96:24 Man the answer is absolutely bruschetta
96:27 ban case in point the show was watched
96:30 another three hundred and fifty thousand
96:33 hours I think we netted zeros the
96:37 subscribers to it so that's not very
96:40 common in the world now is it so we're
96:43 not in any organic search you're gonna
96:45 have to pass these around to your
96:46 friends the best way to pass around the
96:48 show is to find something that's very
96:49 relative to your conversation and you
96:52 can have some fun with it if you go to
96:53 the website because there's a search
96:54 field there and it did some adjustments
96:57 to it today
96:57 which is gonna be really old news but
96:59 down the stairs but you get in there so
97:01 it looks better on mobile did you go to
97:03 the search field you search and you
97:04 search on a subject you're thinking
97:06 about you know if you think I haven't
97:08 done an episode search on one of the
97:09 major keywords of what you're thinking
97:10 and boom you'll find there's already an
97:12 episode on it and if I didn't cover
97:14 something if you watch an episode in
97:16 your life geez that was good but I
97:18 thought you're gonna go a completely
97:19 different direction put that in the
97:20 comments for me and I'll revisit the
97:22 subject matter again I just did the
97:24 evolution one last night it's because
97:26 two people asked me to do it and so I
97:28 know they haven't seen the episode two
97:31 but it is a big subject and we can
97:33 lament further about it right there's
97:36 two ways to donate to the show
97:37 monetarily other than watching them and
97:40 letting the ads go by but there's
97:43 patreon which is where everyone is
97:45 and there's PayPal in case you don't
97:47 wanna get stuck in some monthly payment
97:48 thing you know that the website also
97:51 contains the remastered season one so
97:53 even though season one exists on this
97:55 particular channel they're heavily
97:58 copyright infringement the beginning
98:03 from my own personal library so I've cut
98:06 all that out and the only place to see
98:08 those old ones is on this channel
98:10 but if you want to see the ones that are
98:11 all nicely edited the audios good all
98:14 the pauses are taken out go to the
98:16 website or go to bit shoot it has only
98:19 the the new ones but there's a whole
98:20 separate channel with I think 43
98:23 subscribers to it it'll never receive
98:24 any more videos at least you'll have it
98:26 in your queue if you want to pass it on
98:28 to someone or you're catching up on all
98:29 old episodes so that contains a little
98:32 over a hundred episodes not every single
98:35 number is out there because some of them
98:37 are retired because they simply were
98:40 sort of out of date with what ended up
98:43 occurring for a particular topic and
98:45 that's usually a Current Affair thing so
98:48 anyway until next time take care of
98:50 yourself and someone else that I'll see
98:52 on the next deep thoughts over now
