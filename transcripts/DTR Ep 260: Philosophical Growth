00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts so it's a beautiful day
00:41 out there's a debate between two weather
00:45 companies that it's gonna be 71 or 78 so
00:49 if we meet in the middle
00:50 it'll be a great day so today I thought
00:53 we would take a little stroll down the
00:56 Avenue of philosophical growth I think
01:01 that makes sense to most of you for any
01:03 of you who are kind of going okay how do
01:06 you exactly mean that it is the journey
01:12 that you're on from the moment that
01:14 you're born and how you open up your
01:19 mind to see more to realize there are
01:24 more dimensions to something than you
01:26 previously thought apparently my Romeo
01:30 and Juliet is made of non flammable
01:31 materials if you're into this show then
01:35 you're into philosophical growth you are
01:37 you're trying to hear someone else's
01:39 opinions and perspectives on things so
01:41 that you can bring them in put them next
01:43 to yours and compare and see if we have
01:47 similarities see if there's differences
01:49 and then reconcile those in your own
01:53 personal journey right and what's really
01:57 interesting about philosophy in general
01:59 is that you can actually take it as a
02:03 major in college at 18 years old you can
02:07 declare a major in philosophy 40 to 50
02:11 years ago
02:13 mmm that might make sense 60 80 years
02:17 ago it definitely made sense and the
02:19 reason why is this kids knew what
02:23 philosophy meant at 18 years old 60 70
02:28 years ago today they don't know they
02:34 really don't know I would you know I
02:36 would wager out of a school of 500 kids
02:38 and you don't change their curriculum
02:42 you don't force them to do anything the
02:46 second they walk off the stage with
02:47 their diploma in their hand they flip
02:48 their tassel and you sat them down in a
02:52 room you still pay 50 bucks if you take
02:53 a survey what is philosophy you're gonna
02:59 get some pretty bum answers out of
03:03 probably 98% of them and that should
03:07 tell you something because that is the
03:08 fabric that are the are the the next
03:14 generation that's going to take care of
03:17 what we can see as a society if they go
03:20 off and become anything really it curves
03:24 what you can see in what you can't see
03:27 all it takes is a single generation that
03:30 has dumped down with vaccinations
03:32 horrible food horrible media meaning you
03:35 have crappy television that doesn't do
03:37 anything for your crappy music that
03:39 doesn't do anything for you there's
03:41 still out of all things that are
03:43 informative anything that's informative
03:46 right well let's say you get it let's
03:50 say you're one of the people who get it
03:51 now in this show if you're watching the
03:54 show you totally get it I mean if you've
03:55 watched two or three of these you know
03:57 where you are then it's one of these
04:00 sort of undefined areas of what do you
04:04 want to see what area of the world do
04:07 you really want to see something
04:09 different you know there's introspection
04:12 do you want to see more of your soul
04:15 more of your as Freud would call it your
04:17 heed your character and your persona you
04:20 know there's this this old show on TV
04:23 that was on TV called Cheers
04:25 and in the about halfway through you get
04:28 this fictional character played by
04:30 Kelsey Grammer in Frasier Crane
04:34 very soon after that he finally meets
04:37 his wife Lillian or Lilith or whatever
04:40 name is and she's a behavior list and
04:44 he's a Freudian psychologist and they
04:47 have a lot of fun with this later down
04:49 the line if you study any of that stuff
04:51 in school in college especially you will
04:54 laugh wholeheartedly at these things but
04:58 there's a debate where she says you know
05:00 no one in their right mind hangs on to
05:01 Freud any more Freud is done he was very
05:05 superstitious man and he's not really a
05:09 philosopher for this realm but he did
05:11 create some realms of thoughts that can
05:16 help you sort of sort out the chaos in
05:18 your mind at least I found it very
05:20 useful and just to reiterate you know
05:24 you're it is essentially that center
05:27 core of yourself that is the chaotic
05:30 wind of thought that you can't
05:32 completely control if you've ever had a
05:34 little vision of something that you
05:36 couldn't control in your mind that's
05:38 where the it'd belongs and Freud called
05:40 that your sort of your inner child and
05:42 that is he's using the name child
05:45 because it's sort of like the human wild
05:47 animal as a child they do what they want
05:50 they don't have any education when they
05:52 break the rules you don't punish them as
05:53 much because they their kid so you tried
05:56 your best to teach him the next step is
05:59 your character it is the thing that you
06:02 really are whether it's you're a racist
06:03 or not or you're a good person you're a
06:06 giver you're taker that's your character
06:09 and then there's your persona your
06:12 persona is the outer veneer that you
06:14 share with the rest of the world you
06:17 might be a racist internally but you
06:18 pretend not to be you know and those
06:21 three categories actually become very
06:23 useful for the study of the self and
06:25 then you could get into real
06:27 philosophers that range all over the
06:31 place in terms of what a man is capable
06:35 of a man is a generic term for both
06:38 genders
06:39 mankind and what man is not capable of
06:42 doing you know do cart I guess the he
06:49 went really deep into the self he was
06:51 saying I think therefore I am very very
06:56 interesting but now let me throw this at
07:01 you we tend to have philosophical growth
07:04 as a random happenstance right well you
07:09 know I grew a little bit this year oh
07:11 you did how did you grow well you know I
07:12 started up this year thinking that
07:14 peanut butter and jelly was better than
07:17 peanut butter and chocolate and
07:18 eventually I was corrected but what if
07:23 you intentionally grew you intentionally
07:26 sat down and said I would like to grow
07:28 in this area of my life this perception
07:31 of my life you don't really hear that
07:34 then often do you you just let life
07:37 happen to you and you attempt to sort
07:39 out anything that's confusing and that
07:43 is where you considered yourself to have
07:45 grown at the end of that next interval
07:47 of a self analysis maybe it's a year
07:50 maybe it's a decade there's no right or
07:53 wrong way so please don't take away the
07:57 wrong sentiment here but if this is
08:00 something that interests you it really
08:03 turns you on to kind of look out to the
08:05 world and go wow you know I I thought of
08:08 it this way and then I considered
08:12 looking at that way and when I consider
08:13 look the other way there was this fun
08:15 thing that happened now for everyone who
08:20 I think has been down the flat earth row
08:24 there's a very interesting philosophical
08:26 thing that will happen to you and it
08:28 definitely happened to me which is and
08:33 you know I just want to put a footnote
08:35 in here too it's not really related to
08:36 this episode for those of you that need
08:38 jerked against Flat Earth and you never
08:40 did any research into the philosophy and
08:43 you know it was a Aristotle so that you
08:48 know one of the most one of the bravest
08:51 things you can do is
08:52 consider a thought without making it
08:54 your belief sort of thing I think that
08:57 if you rejected flat earth and you
09:00 didn't get into it for a moment almost
09:02 to the point of believing it for a
09:04 second to let yourself believe it then
09:08 you're not really who I'm talking to
09:10 I think you should get to a point where
09:12 you can test a belief first what second
09:15 there was at least two or three points
09:18 where I looked up at the sky and thought
09:20 there is the firmament dome for me it
09:25 was a rainbow the rainbow that is shaped
09:29 like a ream like a like a dome and once
09:32 you studied the atmosphere and light it
09:35 really doesn't make sense to me how that
09:37 actually occurs and maybe someone can
09:38 explain it to me who's an optic major I
09:41 don't believe the world's flat unless
09:43 we're in some weird simulation however I
09:48 was walking at the beach I said this a
09:49 long time ago in an episode I was
09:51 walking with my girlfriend at the time
09:52 and walking up this path and it's just
09:55 gorgeous you know kind of wilderness on
09:57 the beach a little tiny little place
10:01 where they had built a bunch of places
10:02 back in the 50s and I'm looking up at
10:05 this perfect blue sky I means deep blue
10:07 and I'm just thinking there it is
10:09 there's the dump and I had this feeling
10:10 that it was a dome and feeling that
10:12 there was a firmament and that this was
10:14 a really cool thing that someone had
10:17 created it was a wonderful feeling so I
10:21 tested it and then it allowed me to
10:25 sample it you know have you ever been
10:29 with a friend and you take them to sushi
10:33 you're totally addicted to sushi they
10:36 like fish you know some people don't
10:38 like fish it doesn't really matter what
10:40 food this is but someone will tell you
10:42 that they don't like certain foods and
10:45 you're like okay well hey tell me what
10:47 your bad experience was I'm interested
10:49 well I just don't like it I you know in
10:52 fact I never really had it or they'll
10:53 say that they had it at three years old
10:55 and now they don't you know they never
10:59 have liked it ever since
11:00 and you're sitting there going come on
11:03 three
11:05 really at a friend of mine that didn't
11:09 like a certain he didn't like any
11:10 condiments on his hamburgers and you
11:15 know he ended up like someone we made
11:17 him a hamburger once at a barbecue we
11:19 accidentally put mayonnaise on all the
11:22 burgers that burned this one batch I
11:24 don't need man he's on my burgers but we
11:26 scraped it off gave it to the dude he
11:30 ate the whole thing there's no problem
11:32 we laughed we didn't tell him then he
11:36 got some fast food then they put
11:38 mayonnaise on his burger and he knew it
11:40 and we scraped it off
11:42 it was almost nothing there he even ran
11:44 it under some water put it back on his
11:47 burger he then sort of gagged when he
11:52 was taking bites of it because in his
11:54 brain he was eating a condiment how
11:57 powerful the mind is but don't think
12:00 about that think about how powerful that
12:02 is what you store in your mind is truth
12:07 or false it is extremely powerful for
12:12 governing every second of your life
12:14 which is why I personally believe we
12:17 have to put a lot of effort into how
12:20 this is done we don't even attempt in
12:23 America to teach our kids about
12:25 philosophy before they jump into college
12:28 in fact college is sort of this
12:31 christening moment in American reality
12:33 where we do discuss philosophy we'll
12:37 tell our children well you're gonna take
12:39 philosophy classes when you're there and
12:41 they're like what is that oh it's where
12:43 you start considering that the world
12:44 might be different than you think and
12:45 you're gonna start looking at things oh
12:47 that sounds exciting but what is the
12:51 brain of an 18 year old today in America
12:53 it's not that deep I mean there are
12:56 exceptions for those kids we don't need
12:59 to worry about them when is a child most
13:03 malleable to reality when they're
13:08 brand-new when they're brand-new which
13:11 is why the globalists try to get to your
13:13 kids as soon as possible terrifying them
13:16 with stories of global warming and
13:18 trying to make sure that
13:19 they don't use words like boy and girl
13:21 and if the parents don't wake the F up
13:26 their kids will just be fodder for a
13:29 cannon fodder for a cannon
13:33 meant you're putting all that effort
13:35 into raising a child and then they're
13:37 just sort of put in some globalists meat
13:40 grinder some war that doesn't need to be
13:42 waged we go into an educational system
13:46 and learn absolutely nothing so in your
13:50 philosophical growth I think it's
13:52 important to think about where do you
13:55 want to be in the end
13:56 what sort of brain do you want what sort
13:59 of perspective do you want what freedoms
14:01 do you want when you have a thought you
14:05 want to have a lot of room to move
14:07 around or do you want it to be
14:09 laser-focused you could have different
14:12 categories well when it comes to work
14:15 and making money I want to get in and I
14:17 want to get out quickly
14:19 I want to mess around I'm gonna
14:20 philosophically think about my paycheck
14:22 I just want to get it and go do
14:24 something more interesting that is truly
14:26 philosophical and limitless when I take
14:29 a vacation to Hawaii I look at the the
14:33 mountains the volcanic mountains in
14:36 Hawaii I want to have my brain
14:38 absolutely wide open I want to be
14:40 sucking life force out of these islands
14:43 and enriching my soul I want to give you
14:48 an example that just recently happened
14:50 to me that I really can't explain now I
14:55 can give you a big conspiratorial
14:57 explanation but I went home to the
15:01 Midwest from literally the west coast
15:04 1,800 miles inland to Kansas for my high
15:07 school reunion last year and so I'm
15:11 leaving Los Angeles you know which from
15:15 pop culture standpoint I got a beach
15:17 three miles down the street that's the
15:19 most gorgeous Beach in California we got
15:22 everything
15:23 Disneyland's eight miles out way and Bob
15:26 would that's pop culture's definition of
15:30 my fortune to be here great weather all
15:33 the time go back to Midwest it's it's
15:36 fall it's September late September it is
15:40 beautiful yeah no rain storms and I'm
15:45 driving I get there late evening I got
15:48 driving to the night and the just the
15:54 presence just being there now there's
15:56 obviously a nostalgic cloud that's
15:58 coming around me seeing a bunch of
16:00 things that I grew up with right but
16:03 there was a clear difference and the
16:06 amount of tension in the air in the
16:08 Midwest than there is here nothing was
16:13 really happening to me at all I'm
16:15 driving around in cars you know there's
16:18 a couple little there's like two little
16:20 towns I had to stay two towns away from
16:21 my hometown because you know the tickets
16:23 are booked I thought that many hotel
16:26 rooms in my motel rooms in my hometown
16:29 sets take it up quickly they want to
16:31 bother family and because I I also want
16:36 the freedom to come and go and I want so
16:37 I stayed like seventeen miles away
16:39 that's fine I know the town that I was
16:41 staying in - next day Sun's up driving
16:45 into my town I'm there a couple days
16:48 early and there is like it felt like
16:52 Hawaii a little bit where the earth
16:53 exude 'add this sort of blissful
16:58 frequency I mean it was beyond just
17:01 happiness it was blissful and there's no
17:05 real physical icons yet that I'm seeing
17:07 right because once you get to your
17:08 hometown you see oh there's the gas
17:10 station there's the old refinery but
17:12 Papa kissed a girl behind that and you
17:16 start having these moments I wasn't even
17:20 at that point yet but I started feeling
17:23 this amazing uplifting feeling and you
17:27 know we have all these electronics here
17:30 in Los Angeles all these cell phone
17:32 towers and stuff and they're just very
17:34 lightly scattered around the Midwest
17:36 maybe that's something
17:38 to go into any deeper conspiracy of you
17:41 know la is supposed to be at each
17:43 other's throats constantly so perhaps
17:45 there's something happening in this area
17:48 I have no idea but I've been back to the
17:51 Midwest several times and now that
17:54 feeling before I mean I've never had a
17:56 bad experience there but I never had
17:57 this super euphoric experience and in
18:00 this particular journey I was completely
18:01 by myself and I've been back with
18:05 girlfriends and my daughter and you know
18:08 super tons of money I'm gonna blow a
18:10 bunch of money on fireworks and stuff
18:12 like that
18:14 this little solo trip was better than
18:17 any trip I'd had before and I have less
18:20 family in my hometown now that I had
18:22 before I only have one aunt nokels to
18:26 loser and they weren't even in town okay
18:30 so very interesting it was amazing the
18:36 reason I mentioned that is that I
18:37 suspect outside of some crazy physical
18:42 anomaly is going on Los Angeles that
18:43 makes everyone kind of feel tense I have
18:48 opened my mind to appreciate the
18:51 simplicity of the Midwest the
18:54 good-natured people that will pull over
18:57 on the side of the road in the cold
18:58 freezing rain to make sure that your
19:00 flat tire gets fixed if you don't know
19:03 how to do it but how can philosophy help
19:06 you in life because to simply study
19:09 something to split the atom just split
19:11 the atom just split the atom it's got a
19:14 marginal return you'll get bored of it
19:16 you must improve yourself I think before
19:19 you will allow something to continue as
19:21 a regimen in your life and I do believe
19:24 that expansions in thoughts I've got an
19:27 episode called expanding your mind which
19:29 is sort of what kicked off this because
19:31 one of the listeners went back and
19:32 listened to it recently and really
19:34 enjoyed it and made a comment yeah yeah
19:36 we should probably touch base on this a
19:38 little bit more we have a listener who's
19:41 created a group called philosophy stuff
19:43 it's either group or page you post all
19:46 kinds of cool stuff up there on this
19:49 show you know there is a
19:52 we kind of acknowledged the lifespan of
19:54 a human being and so you know there's
19:58 all kinds of ways to look at this but
19:59 one of the big things I try to do is
20:01 share with you my perception of the
20:03 overall you know beginning mill and end
20:07 of this cycle of life and to sort of
20:12 lift the weights off your back about
20:14 what you're supposed to be doing and
20:15 take the burdens of slavery corporate
20:18 slavery off of you even if you have to
20:20 stay in it to pay your bills
20:21 but to give you sort of an inner peace
20:24 to yourself to go I get the game I'm
20:27 allowing the game to play me to this
20:29 level but overall I'm playing it and if
20:34 I want to make a big change in my career
20:36 I don't panic I don't feel like it needs
20:38 to happen tomorrow
20:39 I simply slowly steer the boat towards a
20:44 particular idea of changing my life I
20:47 test it out I look at a role played in
20:50 my brain okay if I live there and I did
20:52 this and I made this amount of money and
20:53 what is it like to get up every day in
20:55 milk a cow you know that sounds cool for
20:58 a little while than you realize then you
20:59 know I am over 50 being I should
21:01 probably not do that you know whatever
21:02 it is you have this this calm relaxed
21:06 control of your life looking at the
21:08 implications of all the change that you
21:10 might be considering and then if you say
21:13 now that was a neat idea but I don't
21:15 really want to do that I want let's see
21:17 what are the symbols of what I want to
21:19 do instead of the actual tasks I want to
21:21 do I love creating things okay so
21:24 artwork I'm pretty good at this a pretty
21:26 good eye but I can learn that thing I
21:27 don't know start going on YouTube
21:30 looking on videos and you start find out
21:32 people do things you get more
21:34 perspective but in the end you're living
21:36 in this sort of this algorithmic cloud
21:39 that is who you are as a human being all
21:41 your motives all the things that turn
21:43 you on that turn you off right in the
21:47 end it's about control there's a lot of
21:50 stuff going on in this universe second a
21:52 second that involves you and so we are
21:58 sort of some we're like a layer of
22:02 software that runs on top of other
22:03 software
22:05 and then as we have children and we
22:07 create our own paradigms of existence
22:09 it's sort of like we're writing sub
22:11 software right think about your house
22:14 your house is nothing more than a
22:15 container that protects your stuff it
22:18 protects you in the middle of the night
22:19 but you create a little ecosystem inside
22:22 your house don't you and you can create
22:25 whatever ruleset you want especially if
22:27 you're single you can get up when you
22:30 want and you're like keys go here drinks
22:33 go there underwear goes there then you
22:35 start bringing another someone else in
22:36 your life and now you've got to share
22:38 the disciplines and share the
22:39 philosophies of what's going on you feel
22:42 me okay when you leave the door now
22:47 you're in a bigger system with a lot of
22:48 other people so you're getting a car
22:51 it's a philosophy of how to make a turn
22:54 you know bad drivers breakthrough turns
22:57 good drivers accelerate through turns
23:00 some people took took a class some
23:02 people had a good father that taught
23:04 them how to drive others didn't driving
23:08 is one of these places where we get
23:10 angry whether or not we actually take
23:12 action over it and road rage is really
23:15 irrelevant there'll be times when
23:17 someone drives different than us and we
23:20 have those those milliseconds leading up
23:23 to deciding of whether or not you should
23:24 be angry about it whether you should
23:26 vocalize your anger inside your car
23:28 whether I should go nuts and yell
23:30 outside your car flip the bird try not
23:33 to do that last one but as you grow up
23:37 you start to realize okay there are old
23:39 people who have super impaired senses
23:44 you have young people that are coming on
23:46 board and just you know trying to hang
23:48 on to the steering wheel again I can't
23:49 imagine trying to learn how to drive in
23:51 this world and in the big city I grew up
23:54 a little country town with speed limits
23:55 for twenty and thirty and then you have
23:58 foreigners people who have moved from
24:01 countries that don't have cars they
24:02 can't afford them they rode bicycles
24:04 until the age of 45 they saved up their
24:07 money and they came over and bought a
24:08 big fat tanky Lexus and now they're just
24:15 playing bumper cars
24:17 there's a philosophy and a system of
24:21 deciphering events that will either make
24:23 you or break you and what's interesting
24:27 about philosophical existence meaning
24:30 you are lucid of the fact that there's a
24:32 process to everything is that you know
24:36 that you can build a discipline about
24:38 every element of your life what is your
24:41 philosophy about going to bed how do you
24:44 take a shower why do you take a shower
24:45 that way you know right now in the world
24:48 we have we have had some very lazy
24:52 elders that were duped and so the world
24:59 has globalists all over they were able
25:01 to do what they did
25:02 effortlessly because it was accepted
25:07 it's sort of a bit like the themes in
25:10 the in the BBC show Downton Abbey which
25:12 is no longer where at the beginning of
25:15 the show you had a aristocracy that owns
25:18 his giant mansion and you had they had
25:21 servants and there was a class structure
25:23 within the house right philosophy inside
25:26 the house and then as the series moved
25:30 on there was an undoing of this class
25:32 structure they lost the ability to
25:36 afford all their amenities and all their
25:38 land and all the little manor houses the
25:41 servants went from people that thought
25:43 that they would never do anything other
25:44 than work for this family
25:47 to realizing they can go to college and
25:50 go get a career of their own and learn
25:52 how to speak proper English all it took
25:55 was a little twist of the mind as each
25:59 of us go from living in our parents
26:01 homes to living in the world without our
26:04 parents over our head there's a
26:05 philosophical upgrade that rite of
26:07 passage that is genetic there is a point
26:12 where you do not want to be told what to
26:14 do now there are a handful of folks that
26:20 are the opposite
26:21 they are so utterly coddled utterly
26:24 coddled or they are so awkward because
26:27 their parent didn't imbue them with any
26:29 confidence that going
26:30 the real world is terrifying there's the
26:36 morbidly obese gentleman on YouTube it
26:40 was made I think a fictional character
26:41 named Francis he's really no more but he
26:44 used to sit at home and create these
26:46 fake videos he actually created this
26:47 sort of mentally [ __ ] character he
26:51 would play and people didn't know if it
26:52 was him and it wasn't he was a fictional
26:54 character he created he would do rants
26:56 and things and but in real life he lives
26:59 with his mother the whole family is in
27:04 that mode they're all 200 pounds
27:08 overweight I can say that he
27:11 philosophically didn't grow as
27:14 intellectual as he might be he didn't
27:16 grow to a point where he had
27:18 self-respect to take care of his body
27:20 and self-respect to move out of his
27:23 mother's house and go develop a life of
27:27 his own perhaps to meet a girl start a
27:30 family he was stunted by a lack of
27:32 intellectual input from where he was and
27:36 I think he's still in that camp right
27:38 now so there is a philosophy of how to
27:41 raise your offspring do you want to
27:45 empower them or do you want to capture
27:46 them the more that you love your
27:49 children the more it's tough to let go
27:50 of them the child will most likely want
27:54 to get out of the house for God so how
27:55 much you love them but I've seen
27:58 firsthand you know parents in my circles
28:03 guilt-trip their children that really
28:05 young ages because the parent themselves
28:08 our children they're our philosophies
28:12 and personal success do you really need
28:16 to impress someone that doesn't exist
28:18 that you're all that isn't it
28:20 interesting that if you were say an
28:23 inventor
28:24 and you end up inventing something
28:27 amazing a zero-point energy system no
28:29 one knows you exist until you debut that
28:32 system into the world
28:33 once you've debuted it and people
28:35 benefit from it they may mention your
28:37 name on a daily basis like a household
28:39 name but after at that point you were
28:43 you're the invisible man or the
28:45 invisible woman nobody knows that you
28:47 exist no that's a gamble isn't it to say
28:52 a boy if I don't invent this thing I
28:55 don't succeed in getting an investor to
28:58 help me give this to the world or
29:00 however you're gonna do it I will have
29:03 never been noticed by this world that I
29:05 believe within my philosophy I need to
29:07 be acknowledged by I moved to California
29:11 so that I could do what I wanted to do
29:13 for a living because the careers that
29:15 exist in the Midwest and late 80s I got
29:18 extremely lucky to get into those
29:19 careers okay and I got celebrated in
29:23 small circles very small circles for
29:27 being good at what I was doing and it
29:29 was nice but what I found out later on
29:32 was that I never really cared if any
29:35 would acknowledged what I did I was a
29:38 really good artist as a child and so I
29:40 was very used to this being acknowledged
29:42 by people but it always made me feel
29:44 uncomfortable you know I want those
29:46 people that when you give me a really
29:48 good gift it gives me more anxiety than
29:50 pleasure for the first several minutes
29:52 because I don't think I can express
29:57 outwardly the amazing feeling I'm having
29:59 in inside and I think that you deserve
30:02 to know how much it makes me happy that
30:05 you thought of me and gave me anything
30:07 thought let alone an object right and I
30:12 don't know exactly when this happened
30:14 for me I think it was in my mid-20s
30:18 there was a moment when I went home to
30:23 my hometown and we have porches on our
30:27 homes which it's not something you find
30:30 in California that often we're talking
30:32 about the hang and swing a bench it has
30:37 an awning overhead so it could rain like
30:39 crazy and you can still just sit there
30:40 and watch the rain you're not getting
30:42 wet and we have this street Lincoln
30:45 that's sort of our cross street to Main
30:47 Street there's a bunch of porch houses
30:51 on Lincoln and I remember going back
30:53 once and seeing just some really old
30:56 people on these
30:57 inches and it's usually a male pastime
31:00 because a male like a man will be out
31:03 there whittling something fixing a
31:04 fishing pole kid you not and just
31:09 watching traffic drive by and Here I am
31:12 coming in from California and so I'm
31:14 living this life where many times
31:16 because I had a really good grasp it was
31:19 like to live in a little tiny town in
31:21 the Midwest with you know ten thousand
31:22 people or less I'd be in California and
31:25 I'd be in some party or be it's an art
31:27 gallery or some amazing event and I'd
31:28 say man if my friends can only see me
31:30 now and it wasn't in a boastful way it
31:33 was just kind of like dan this is really
31:35 amazing like I went to the Hollywood
31:36 Bowl very quickly after moving here and
31:39 it's a it's a gorgeous venue but then I
31:44 came back and I've ever seen this guy on
31:46 a porch and I thought wow the things
31:51 that I've seen you know is like Roy
31:52 batty at the end of Blade Runner Rutger
31:55 Hauer character and he's telling Deckard
31:57 Harrison Ford's character all these
31:59 things that he is seen in traveling the
32:02 galaxy and he was trying to desperately
32:06 preserve that those moments by staying
32:09 alive you know cuz he only has a really
32:10 small lifespan but I'm staring at this
32:13 little gun I'm thinking who's winning
32:16 this game if there was any level of
32:20 calorie energy spent into life and what
32:23 you get out of it who's happier right
32:30 this old men and I thing is I'm assuming
32:32 this old guy hasn't been anywhere to
32:34 which is really sad on my part as a
32:36 child mid-twenties male but I always
32:41 empathetically put myself in someone
32:43 else's position to the best of my
32:45 ability and I'm thinking about this guy
32:46 he must have been in his late 70s early
32:50 80s still look really healthy I could
32:53 still see him in my mind and he is
32:57 literally thinking okay if I make
33:00 another 10 years
33:01 I am absolutely living in gravy you know
33:04 in terms of winning this game however
33:09 he's living he's able to pay his
33:11 maybe the Social Security takes care of
33:13 rent he's able to eat I don't know if he
33:17 had anyone else in the house hopefully
33:20 but he is chilling he is just sitting
33:23 there relaxing he is smelling the
33:27 flowers as they say when I used to be in
33:30 a would like a whittling workshop sort
33:34 of Club with my grandfather before I
33:35 moved to California tons of these guys
33:38 in there you know like I've said a
33:39 couple times at different shows you just
33:42 get a piece of wood and go for it but
33:45 seeing that old guy on the patio
33:47 on his little swing it was a swing
33:51 changed my life it when I went back to
33:54 California I thought about the game I
33:57 thought wow I don't want the game to
33:59 play me I want to play the game for my
34:01 perspective yeah I can pull out when I
34:03 want I can do one thing and get rid of
34:06 it or whatever I'm just going to be
34:08 maybe trying to experience some things
34:10 that that are important to me but the
34:15 back of my head I'm like I think I want
34:17 to be that old man on that porch when
34:20 I'm his age my finances are set up in
34:23 such a way that I can survive I'll never
34:27 retire from thinking because I don't
34:29 want my brain to rot I've said several
34:31 times on the show a long time ago that
34:34 for all the obstacles that you have to
34:36 tolerate in life as long as it can't
34:39 kill you then you're probably a hundred
34:45 percent capable of changing the
34:47 circumstances in your life by simply
34:49 understanding what's happening to you
34:52 the philosophy of debt is a very
34:54 interesting philosophy it is one that we
34:59 allow to dominate our mind and and sort
35:01 of provide this blanket of inertia on
35:05 what we want to do with our life oh my
35:07 god I've got this huge mortgage now you
35:12 don't want to commit a crime because
35:13 then society has decided it's philosophy
35:15 is to incarcerate you under certain
35:18 circumstances financial financial crimes
35:21 are really stealing other people's money
35:22 but going default on a loan
35:24 done a crime and just something that
35:27 happens you go bankrupt right one of the
35:30 big touch points of your philosophy in a
35:32 personal sense is what matters what do
35:36 you think matters in this world and I
35:40 think it's one of those areas that if I
35:42 was to re-educate myself from my youth I
35:45 would tell myself son be very careful
35:51 with what you bring into your domain
35:53 that you are going to determine matters
35:58 try to keep it simple try to keep it
36:01 good let the world worry about itself in
36:05 in many ways I'm always saying on the
36:09 show that if you hear news about
36:10 something horrific happening some local
36:13 news in some other region of the world
36:19 it's not any concern of yours it's not
36:24 if it's Anna bicha 'but the world has
36:26 created that's going to potentially
36:27 spill into your local region and affect
36:30 you personally let go for it but we want
36:37 to care don't we we want to help others
36:38 don't we
36:40 you can't help all the people in the
36:43 world you can't rescue every animal in
36:46 the world
36:47 you just can't it'd be awesome if you
36:50 could be awesome if we could population
36:52 control animals we can't just have every
36:56 wild animal that that we want to
36:58 domesticate procreate at will and then
37:00 we're rushing in to solve the
37:03 overpopulation problem of those animals
37:06 no one rushes out to rescue a bear
37:10 no one rushes out to rescue you know any
37:13 an indigenous animal that is simply
37:15 going through an overpopulation problem
37:17 except for cats and dogs and we know
37:23 that for these animals that overpopulate
37:26 they die horrible deaths
37:27 they're either savagely consumed by
37:30 their predators or they they starve to
37:32 death
37:33 you don't think goats fall off those
37:35 giant mountains when they're running
37:36 around
37:37 hooves it happens they break their
37:40 little necks and they sit there and
37:42 starve while they rained on you know but
37:46 we philosophically divided the behaviors
37:50 of some animals to be more human-like
37:52 more domesticated we've created animals
37:55 we have created animals species on this
37:57 planet that cannot take care of
37:59 themselves you think a teacup poodle
38:02 could live in the world by itself no way
38:05 no way that thing would perish in a
38:08 microsecond but that's a bunch of
38:11 earthbound stuff a lot of us dig as well
38:17 the philosophy of what we are and this
38:20 is where you get into folks that are bit
38:22 of red holographic universe book they
38:26 have considered that we live in a matrix
38:29 and above all every day that they wake
38:33 up and that they think about this their
38:36 mind is an utterly blown at what they're
38:39 experiencing that we actually exist and
38:42 that there are really truly no answers
38:47 and you need a philosophy to deal with
38:49 that unknown I have an episode on the
38:53 unknown dealing with it on a daily basis
38:58 philosophically being okay with it in
39:02 that area of sort of the super
39:05 existential thought process we then have
39:10 our unexplained experiences a bit like
39:12 sort of philosophical UFOs you see what
39:16 you believe to be a ghost
39:18 you think you read someone's mind
39:21 something happens it seems supernatural
39:24 in some cases you can explain it away or
39:27 at least offer yourself some theories of
39:29 it being explained away in other cases
39:32 you can't but I have my little
39:35 experience which I won't go through in
39:37 great detail beany Walt Disney and being
39:40 told by Bob Gurr Imagineer that he hired
39:42 was in the park and walking straight to
39:45 him with my girlfriend
39:47 and his good buddy next to him there's
39:49 four of us witnessing this event the
39:52 event is now ice down in history is
39:54 happening how it happened was driven by
39:59 me somebody in my opinion the apparition
40:04 of Walt Disney in my mind's eye came up
40:07 to me and said Bob Gers over there you
40:09 should go say hi to him and I go to a
40:11 part of the park I would never go to as
40:13 a patron because it's a child's area of
40:16 the park
40:17 and I see Bob standing right there at
40:19 the top of the mountain on top of a
40:21 little slope there actually we went back
40:22 on years it's not exactly as high up as
40:24 I thought it was that shakes up things
40:28 in a really cool way for me personally
40:30 as to how this thing is put together
40:34 calling Bob ger ten years later and
40:36 saying hey Bob this happened to me what
40:40 do you think and he's like yeah it's
40:42 it's funny he goes I remember that
40:44 moment
40:44 very interesting to know that's what
40:46 happened and he goes everyone at the
40:50 park has had an experience like that
40:51 he's worked there for any length of time
40:52 and then I realized the guy that works
40:54 the Hookah place that I go to buy my
40:57 cigars I was no longer there he worked
41:01 at Disneyland for seven years he had
41:03 story after story after story about
41:05 people hearing well warn them he was
41:10 running the the sort of Mississippi I
41:14 forgot the name of the boat but it's
41:16 this big steamboat in Frontierland and
41:20 he said that Walt told him and the guy
41:25 next to him that the engine was about to
41:27 blow the boiler was about to blown to
41:29 get back and they both looked at each
41:32 other when they heard his voice and they
41:34 go did you hear that it and he goes yeah
41:36 and he goes who said that I don't know
41:38 let's get out of here okay they move it
41:40 blows and the boat was out of commission
41:42 for six months it changes their
41:46 philosophy for life as to how they see
41:48 this system and because we as a global
41:53 population do not entertain these
41:55 philosophical possibilities due to
41:57 religion
41:59 we are in the stone Age's in terms of
42:02 what could be a lot of times people will
42:06 wake up and this is happening right now
42:08 in the tech industry I think I think
42:12 even Steve Jobs says something before it
42:14 was over before he died that that you
42:17 know there really aren't and again what
42:19 I'm about to say is not correct but it
42:21 feels this way there really aren't any
42:24 devices that we can create that haven't
42:27 been already created part of that is
42:30 because each component that allows
42:33 devices to be created has sort of
42:36 stagnated right where we live in a world
42:39 of making circuitry out of electrons
42:41 that's what we do if we don't find a
42:44 different way to create some sort of
42:47 energy source that's not an electron
42:49 then we're probably done it's not really
42:52 true but we certainly have maxed out our
42:55 current understanding of how to use this
42:58 stuff miniaturization is done you know
43:01 we we have all the services we think
43:03 that we need in this world and it's
43:06 usually a philosopher who is also some
43:09 sort of writer like a philip k dick like
43:13 him that will come up with new
43:15 inventions black mirrors very
43:17 interesting use of technology that
43:20 doesn't exist yet that if we get that
43:23 technology bio implants and massive
43:27 artificial intelligence that we're gonna
43:28 be able to invent a lot of new things
43:31 but why are things invented in the first
43:33 place things are invented to fill needs
43:37 and what are needs needs are sort of
43:40 your philosophical belief that you're
43:42 missing something did anyone really need
43:46 social media nope it was sort of a an
43:52 anomaly that popped out of you know well
43:55 the the cover story that's BS is you
43:59 know Zuckerberg creating a rate of
44:00 person
44:01 a website we can vote someone upload
44:03 someone down apparently that's the
44:06 extent of his programming capabilities
44:08 by the way but there are organic needs
44:11 that pop up where we live a normal life
44:15 the guy on the porch and we think wow
44:20 I'll be nice to have this orb and I
44:22 really need this my knee hurts or
44:24 whatever my car stopped working we need
44:28 a car that works longer than the car
44:29 that I bought something like that and
44:32 then we have folks that want to control
44:35 us to keep us from thinking keep us from
44:37 expanding they're expanding their minds
44:39 they don't want anyone else to figure it
44:40 out what they know and so they create
44:45 needs to control us social media the
44:50 face scanning NSA database called
44:52 Facebook but then there are counter
44:57 philosophical thoughts we should not be
45:02 controlled
45:02 we should not volunteer our faces into a
45:05 database so that we can be tracked
45:07 around the world
45:09 so isn't is it an imperative that you
45:12 philosophically grow day to day in a
45:14 very conscious way the answer is
45:17 probably very clearly no you're not to
45:21 feel guilty if you don't because you
45:25 will regardless if you know it or not
45:28 the most inundated overwhelmed soccer
45:31 mom who's just taking care of kids
45:33 picking them up in the morning or
45:34 getting them to school in the morning
45:35 give him up getting dressed in the [ __ ]
45:37 into school get him home taking care of
45:40 all their homework and being exhausted
45:42 watching a TV show and going to bed that
45:45 person is still growing philosophically
45:47 slowly and eventually the kids through
45:50 sheer growth will exit her life and she
45:53 will have her own thoughts she will
45:56 simply get her own body out of bed fed
45:58 clothed maybe take on a job chill out
46:01 whatever I don't know how how far back
46:06 the philosophical idea of traveling in
46:08 space goes but I'm willing to assume
46:10 that there was at least a few millennia
46:14 if not a few million millennia where man
46:20 didn't have a clue that space existed
46:24 really as a traveling place to go and in
46:29 the 20th century man decided this was
46:31 something they wanted to play with now
46:34 writers from the 1800's and up were
46:37 writing about travelling in the skies so
46:40 I'm willing to bet that revised history
46:41 is erased a lot of our understanding of
46:43 wind man did this you know again I
46:46 always talk about the big giant drawings
46:48 made of rocks actually quoted
46:50 incorrectly you know the Peruvian
46:53 artwork is created by laying down rocks
46:56 and not scooping them up necessarily
46:58 they're drawing a couple different ways
47:02 we have to assume someone was traveling
47:04 in a hot air balloon or something to see
47:06 these from space or at least creating
47:09 them in a way that only someone could
47:10 see them from high altitude
47:12 I thought occurred to me the other day
47:16 about the Peruvian artwork which has you
47:22 know it looks like they've made some
47:25 mistakes even though the the artwork is
47:27 pretty phenomenal but do you have big
47:29 giant ants you have birds and people all
47:34 wondered into the ground and I wanted to
47:38 throw this little sci-fi idea at you
47:40 which is what if the anglo-saxon artwork
47:48 that they did of bearded white men could
47:53 be middle-eastern could be European
47:56 could be from some other place and the
48:00 beard is something that we missed
48:01 because in South Africa South America
48:03 excuse me
48:04 people don't grow beards until they
48:08 cross bread with the conquistadors was
48:11 this how the philosophy goes this is why
48:12 Native Americans didn't have any facial
48:13 hair
48:14 that's why Asian people don't have a
48:17 tremendous amount of facial hair so when
48:21 they rendered a curly beard Anglo Saxon
48:24 person and we judge Anglo Saxon by the
48:27 height
48:28 portions and nose dimensions and etc
48:31 what if they were drawing these things
48:33 in the ground to scare away what they
48:37 may proceed to be invaders simply saying
48:41 well we'll draw gigantic creatures in
48:44 the ground that when they look down they
48:45 think that this is a real live gigantic
48:47 creature that could get them if you've
48:49 ever been stung by a bullet ant hey an
48:52 ant could be a really powerful being and
48:55 no matter what it is when it's gigantic
48:57 it's freaky who knows that they warmed
49:01 up to ants or thought ants were like the
49:03 menace to their society eating their
49:06 food and crawling all over their
49:08 children I mean it could be really bad
49:10 right there's an old Farsight cartoon
49:13 where someone was trying to cross the
49:16 street and got nailed by like a bullet
49:19 ant trail and they were killed man is a
49:23 very curious beast aren't we you know we
49:27 seek truth I think because truth has an
49:29 innate warm cool I should say warming
49:33 cool like a cool beautiful feeling to us
49:35 right it makes us feel good and when we
49:37 lie we feel bad and we have to hold a
49:39 lie we feel even worse so curiosity
49:44 could merely be that we have the thread
49:46 in the sweater that we attempt to pull
49:48 out but we can't get it to come out and
49:50 our curiosity is the rest of the
49:53 algorithm that were unable to see when
49:56 you see the tip of an iceberg in the
49:57 ocean for instance you are looking at a
50:01 mystery well what is that you touch it
50:04 oh I've seen this stuff it's kind of
50:06 like snow but it's really hard well we
50:07 have water that's frozen at 32 degrees
50:09 perhaps but the more we look down the
50:13 more this thing is absolutely massive
50:17 there goes the curiosity how big is this
50:19 thing
50:20 where'd it come from who made it I think
50:25 one of the fundamental things about this
50:27 particular show and shows like it
50:29 documentaries that you watch in
50:30 conversations that you have with friends
50:32 is that on one level we might be bored a
50:37 particular time we're looking for
50:39 something to juice up our mind
50:40 on the other side of things were happy
50:43 we're not necessary bored but looking
50:45 for something else and that's where the
50:49 the philosophy of looking at life is so
50:53 fascinating and you know we sit around
50:59 and we just discuss things like I'm kind
51:01 of doing in this particular episode I
51:04 think it's valuable to remember the
51:06 philosophies that you have beautifully
51:09 mitigated in your life you have been
51:11 confused and you made some decisions
51:14 about how to remove that confusion or at
51:18 least put it in a safe place where
51:20 you're okay with the unknown and you go
51:23 about your life if you like me you will
51:28 think about where we're from and were
51:31 you know the first chicken-and-egg
51:33 moment may have happened to create this
51:34 universe and you will get this weird
51:37 sort of cathartic moment where you are
51:42 having both an elation feeling of oh my
51:46 gosh what's what's amazing is regardless
51:48 if I can figure it out I am here and I
51:50 am a part of this and the other thing
51:51 part of it's like that
51:53 Hopson five guy the rapper h o psi n
51:57 amazing dude and his his rap that I
52:02 posted on deep thoughts radio Facebook
52:05 group where he just talks about having
52:09 been a Christian follow Phillip out of
52:11 Christianity and then he's he's still
52:17 saying look God if you want me to live
52:20 my life carefully than you need to show
52:22 yourself you know have my own philosophy
52:25 of why that can't happen but he still
52:27 makes a really good point on his end I
52:30 wanted to make this episode so that we
52:32 have just sort of a a pit stop outside
52:37 of any context of any subject matter so
52:39 that we can just sort of sit around and
52:41 talk about the idea of philosophy and
52:43 how we apply it to our lives without
52:46 getting into any one philosophers take
52:48 on things it sort of as if this is
52:52 literally a pit stop you
52:54 race the race of life and it requires
52:57 your paradigms of thought and your
52:59 philosophies on how to do things but
53:01 when we come into this little point
53:03 we're taking a break we're halfway down
53:07 the mountain and this is a ski lodge and
53:09 you come inside and we're like are we
53:11 gonna ski the second half of this thing
53:13 exactly like we've skied the first half
53:15 of this thing is anybody who'd been down
53:16 the second half that we know any
53:17 information about that and we compare
53:19 notes and you know I heard that you can
53:21 just take it really careful if you want
53:23 but if you really are looking for the
53:25 super exciting thing there's a triple
53:27 diamond over there and you can just hop
53:29 off mountainsides but it's very
53:30 dangerous you might die in the first
53:32 jump and you'll make it to the bottom
53:34 but you won't be skiing in the process
53:37 so I think you feel me I appreciate all
53:42 of you guys coming in and offering your
53:44 perspective and again there's no right
53:47 and wrong in this world in my opinion in
53:49 terms of philosophy or something it's
53:52 just we're all struggling to figure out
53:53 what works best for all of us right for
53:56 our individual selves and for society
53:58 around us so I invite you to share your
54:02 comments our numbers are growing in
54:06 terms of subscriptions you know I watch
54:09 other youtubers all the time and I'm
54:13 just gonna let you know I don't the
54:15 thing I hate the most when I watch a
54:17 youtube video but it does work is that
54:20 right when these people start these
54:21 videos are like like' and subscribe'
54:23 post your comments and they're really
54:24 trying to [ __ ] out the mechanism that
54:26 increases their metrics my philosophy is
54:30 I have to earn your respect you know I
54:31 have to earn your subs subscription so
54:34 that's why I don't do that just you know
54:36 but I do appreciate it when you guys
