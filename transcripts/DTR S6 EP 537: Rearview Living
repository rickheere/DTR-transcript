00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen i almost forgot where we were
00:39 i'm like
00:39 where are we welcome to uh so today i'm
00:43 going to touch on a subject that uh
00:46 it's sort of one of those things that if
00:49 you can make this work for yourself
00:51 then you're good if you can't then
00:56 it's maybe potentially useful for you
01:00 to have someone recap sort of the
01:02 consequences
01:04 of this sort of lifestyle because let's
01:07 just itemize life real quick
01:13 you remember when i told you guys that
01:15 in my opinion the only thing that makes
01:17 you compatible with the other human
01:18 being is your purpose in life
01:22 that's it everything else will fall into
01:24 place
01:25 whether you like spicy food or rock and
01:29 roll or not or whatever
01:30 all that stuff will fall into place or
01:32 it won't even matter once you find the
01:34 right person
01:36 if your day-to-day churn is totally
01:41 uh making you happy then
01:45 then you're good you don't need to do
01:47 anything more than just maybe
01:48 psychologically take this in and form
01:51 your own opinions or what have you
01:53 i'm assuming that the value of this
01:55 episode will probably not be for
01:57 you but like myself
02:01 you will know people in your life
02:05 that do this and you will have a little
02:07 bit more
02:08 thought process to digest it perhaps
02:13 better accept it or
02:16 you know in extreme cases maybe you know
02:18 stop hanging out with individuals
02:21 as much perhaps because our behavior
02:26 influences each other
02:30 i give an example there's someone saying
02:33 that something's good something's bad
02:35 around you a lot
02:36 and again repetition is the number one
02:38 way the brain accepts a particular
02:40 concept or not
02:43 then there might be someone who is more
02:45 of a hermit
02:47 and you're more of an extrovert and so
02:52 if you're going to visit them on a
02:53 regular basis then you're not going
02:55 outside you're going inside
02:56 now usually most of us have a quiet time
03:00 during the day and sometimes that kind
03:02 of person can be a
03:03 wonderful person to visit because even
03:06 though they
03:07 choose to spend about 24 hours a day
03:09 inside their house their place or
03:10 whatever
03:12 you're only going to spend a few hours
03:14 and that's kind of what you want you
03:15 kind of want a little bit of personal
03:17 time
03:18 but it might start out that you're only
03:19 spending half an hour there then you
03:21 start putting
03:21 spending an hour then two within four
03:23 then eight and eventually
03:25 you lose your life and what is normally
03:30 your
03:34 that makes you you you start becoming
03:36 someone else because you spend so much
03:38 time with them
03:40 but this one's about living in the
03:41 rearview mirror and there's a big
03:44 distinction between nostalgic thinking
03:47 and living in the rearview mirror
03:51 nostalgic thinking typically and i did a
03:54 whole episode on it
03:56 it is
04:00 visiting what perhaps we had right in
04:03 the past
04:05 or just visiting a time in your life
04:07 that is it was just
04:08 has wonderful memories that's all but
04:11 you visit it
04:12 you visit these things just about as
04:14 often as you might visit
04:16 um disneyland you know if you didn't
04:19 live next to disneyland let's just say
04:22 so a few times a year maybe once a year
04:24 you reminisce about what it was like to
04:26 be in high school
04:27 what it was like to get your first job
04:29 or
04:31 whatever it is being a little kid
04:33 building stuff with legos
04:35 that's why i think having children is
04:37 hugely important
04:39 depending on what kind of person you are
04:40 because
04:42 you get to hide your reminiscence
04:45 and your nostalgia directly in the play
04:49 that you have with your children
04:52 hey you know i i don't play with legos
04:53 but you know i had to play with legos
04:55 because i have a grandkid and
04:56 and he or she likes to build things so
04:58 you know i wouldn't normally be doing
04:59 this but
05:00 uh you know i just i got my duties
05:03 meanwhile the guy's
05:04 thinking about the next thing he's gonna
05:06 build while he's at work
05:08 you know he has the grandkids over all
05:11 the time not only to see them
05:14 but because he used to play legos
05:19 living in the past in my opinion
05:24 is a it comes in all kinds of forms of
05:26 course
05:28 but it would be that it becomes
05:31 the majority of what you talk about in
05:34 the present
05:36 constantly reflecting to the past
05:41 and what is we have to be very delicate
05:44 when we deal with these situations
05:46 especially me
05:47 taking the position i'm going to take
05:48 which is um
05:51 you got to really moderate that kind of
05:52 stuff or you lose yourself and you will
05:54 definitely eat up the time today which
05:56 you're never going to get back time
05:58 is the priceless commodity of the
06:00 universe no one needs to really tell you
06:02 that
06:03 most of the time but we do a lot of
06:06 silly stuff
06:07 that eats up this valuable time you know
06:10 youth
06:11 is something you never ever get back
06:15 and you might be thinking i'm talking
06:17 about playing baseball
06:19 and doing and running and jumping and
06:22 doing things like basic training stuff
06:24 well there's definitely that too if you
06:26 love those things you'll know that as
06:28 you get older
06:30 you can break a hip at some point but
06:32 you can do something teeny tiny
06:34 that might provide a bit of feedback
06:36 that's positive but the big macaroni
06:38 that you really really want never
06:40 happens because one
06:42 you're you're preoccupied with the past
06:45 being your present
06:48 so you don't conceive of what you would
06:50 do otherwise
06:53 and there comes a point where you might
06:57 end up inheriting a regret bubble
07:01 regret is something you can never get
07:04 rid of is the true definition of it so
07:06 if you're able to get rid of
07:07 a regret then it's no longer a regret it
07:10 may not have ever been a regret but
07:12 maybe just a blemish in your own
07:14 past that you were sad that occurred
07:17 but a regret is something you can never
07:19 take back that no matter
07:21 how old you live you can typically
07:24 feel it just like it was yesterday that
07:26 you got it
07:29 and what's what's really strange the one
07:30 that comes to mind just flew into my
07:32 head here
07:34 was i had a uh an acquaintance i met in
07:36 san francisco
07:37 she was dating someone in the family
07:42 and she told me that her and her father
07:45 her father took her to some
07:47 outing or something in the car and that
07:51 they argued the entire trip
07:54 she was young and you know like 14 or
07:56 something so she was
07:58 putting a lot of value on being a little
07:59 rebel of course
08:01 you know where did she get that from
08:02 society
08:04 he drops her off then he dies on the way
08:07 home in a car accident
08:10 and so as an adult she realizes of
08:13 course my father loved me the entire
08:15 time and
08:16 this is just a freak accident but now
08:18 the last thing i ever
08:20 said to my father was something acidic
08:22 and something mean
08:24 that's regret now she knows
08:27 if he's watching her there's no hard
08:30 feelings but it's just a regret that the
08:32 last thing you said was something
08:33 negative instead of i love you
08:37 the rearview mirror species that i see
08:41 is catalyzed typically by
08:45 having had a great past
08:49 and then every time you talk to your
08:51 friends it's the only thing you ever
08:52 talk about
08:54 did i tell you ever did this did i tell
08:55 you did that
08:58 and just normal conversation you know
08:59 not in some
09:02 educational sense
09:06 the other one is the victim card from
09:08 the past
09:11 you were perhaps or they were perhaps a
09:14 victim of some real circumstances
09:16 like my grandmother and the depression
09:20 everybody gets betrayed in life
09:24 everybody everyone gets betrayed every
09:26 once in a while
09:27 why because we set the false
09:31 we set the wrong expectations we
09:36 rely on humans and they are flawed
09:43 but this rear view mirror thing steals
09:45 your future
09:47 now there's this weird line in the sand
09:50 that we all struggle with because we
09:53 struggle with drawing the line in the
09:55 sand ourselves and then we struggle
09:57 looking at others who haven't drawn the
09:59 line in the sand yet
10:01 and that line is okay so some bad stuff
10:05 happened to you in the past
10:07 very sorry about that i mean genuinely
10:10 wish it hadn't happened to you
10:12 especially if you can remember
10:14 in your present and let's say you're
10:16 over 40.
10:17 huge huge thing but then you look back
10:21 into your own life and you've
10:23 definitely got betrayal moments bad
10:25 moments
10:26 and again may not compare to the person
10:27 you're talking to they may have a more
10:29 horrific moment
10:31 but at some point there's this
10:34 demarcation line in the sand that says
10:36 if you continue walking this direction
10:39 you have to qualify as an adult to cross
10:41 that particular line otherwise you're
10:42 going to remain on the playground
10:44 you're going to have recess three times
10:45 a day not a whole day of school
10:49 and then once you get through school you
10:50 have to go into the real world and get a
10:51 job and
10:52 do it and unless you're truly
10:56 treated unfairly you gotta nut up and do
10:58 it every day
11:00 how many movies and stories have you
11:02 heard where there's something horrible
11:04 going on and someone's stuck in a cave
11:06 they're stuck in prison they're
11:07 something's going wrong and they're just
11:09 stuck and they can't get their life back
11:12 true stories out of prison have these
11:13 all the time
11:15 they did something bad in the past and
11:17 they got themselves in a situation
11:19 or in the terms of like you know miners
11:22 getting stuck in caves whether it's not
11:24 their fault
11:24 just something fell in and the world is
11:27 a dynamic place
11:30 and so we're watching this two-hour
11:31 movie three-hour movie and the whole
11:33 thing
11:34 ends with usually hopefully a crescendo
11:37 where the person achieves freedom
11:41 and we see them walk out of the prison
11:43 we see them go to the light at the end
11:44 of the tunnel literally
11:46 maybe they're on some rescue rope you
11:48 know getting pulled out of a
11:49 of us of a mining shaft
11:53 if they were hurt by a loved one in the
11:55 movie and they
11:58 feel horrible about it maybe the loved
12:00 one died at the beginning of the film
12:02 whatever then they meet someone at the
12:04 end of the movie
12:06 and the past is over and they move on
12:08 and we leave the theater as the
12:10 in you know the uplifting music's
12:12 playing their credits are rolling
12:14 and it's like oh man i love that movie
12:16 made me feel good it took me through all
12:18 the tumultuous struggle of a
12:20 bad situation and then the crescendo
12:24 we got out isn't it fascinating
12:27 that people don't manage their lives
12:28 more like this when
12:30 something bad happen it's in the past
12:35 sometimes it's so far in the past you
12:37 wonder how anyone could manifest it into
12:39 their future
12:41 but it happens and we have to respect
12:43 that that's just how the brain
12:45 can clog up bad news
12:48 it's uh and we're not talking about
12:50 things like ptsd
12:52 which are you know one in a million
12:55 situations for human beings you know
12:57 someone in a military vehicle perhaps
13:00 driving over an ied
13:02 that is so far beyond the average day
13:06 event that we're not talking about
13:09 hey get over it man that's not part of
13:11 that go see my
13:12 episode on ptsd if you
13:15 care to see how i was taught a new
13:18 technique
13:19 to help with therapy on that
13:23 there's something about it that just
13:27 i don't know it just seems disingenuous
13:30 to being alive
13:32 because the past is dead and gone
13:36 and again visiting those moments and
13:38 reminiscing about it
13:39 uh i completely 100 percent do and
13:42 respect
13:43 because you know
13:46 we're not to forget who we were
13:49 there's that famous saying you don't
13:51 know where you're going if you don't
13:52 know where you've been
13:54 what i'll typically do you know and i do
13:56 this show so i'm a little bit guilty of
13:58 having to use all my life examples to
14:00 make points and analogies
14:03 but i rarely you know in daily
14:04 conversation with friends
14:07 to sit there and do that with them
14:09 unless somehow we're going down memory
14:11 lane
14:13 or someone wants to be mentored about
14:16 you know how to get a job in the video
14:18 game business and then i take them back
14:20 to my past and we go through it
14:21 simply as a way to work from bottom to
14:23 top but i don't just sit there and say
14:27 you know why don't you play the home
14:28 movie where i did something amazing
14:32 and then let's do it next saturday and
14:34 next saturday i got a friend of mine
14:36 he plays videos of himself and banned
14:40 to his friends as if his friends drove
14:43 completely across california
14:45 to see that who does that
14:48 how many times are you going to show me
14:50 your home movies
14:52 of you popping a wheelie for the first
14:54 time or whatever at some point and get
14:56 over yourself the weird thing about it
14:58 is when you
14:59 observe this behavior over time you
15:02 start to see the pattern
15:04 or a pattern i think it's the pattern
15:08 but it's constantly reminiscing about
15:10 the past either in
15:12 a glorified way which is sort of a
15:16 bizarre conceit
15:18 or a conceitedness excuse me or it is
15:21 i can't do anything really good in the
15:23 future or the present excuse me
15:26 because of all these things that
15:28 happened to me in the past
15:30 it's like okay once you go tell that to
15:33 the guy that went to uh
15:34 afghanistan had both of his legs blown
15:36 off and then came back and joined the
15:38 olympics and
15:40 did something amazing why don't you tell
15:41 me all about that problem you got
15:43 because
15:44 how long ago was that
15:47 and what's strange is they think if they
15:49 can just recreate
15:51 the event more accurately in words that
15:54 somehow
15:55 they can hang on to the teddy bear in
15:58 the present
16:00 you're thinking what
16:04 what's really interesting about it is if
16:05 you don't do this
16:07 but you have friends that do
16:10 especially the one where someone's
16:11 trying to say something bad happened to
16:13 them
16:14 i mean this could be under 10 years old
16:16 only one event
16:18 could be a bad event or
16:21 up and up and up uh happened when i was
16:23 15 this thing happened to us 15 it's
16:25 like
16:26 well did you have your brain replaced
16:27 with a big manure pile
16:30 because other than that you can you know
16:32 it's back there
16:34 isn't that a wonderful thing you had a
16:35 crescendo in the movie
16:37 you actually had a light at the end of
16:39 the tunnel
16:40 sometimes it'll be about people don't
16:42 even exist anymore
16:44 like they're dead and buried already
16:46 it's like
16:48 okay move on man find something positive
16:52 to talk about instead of the
16:53 past negativeness because that past
16:55 negativeness is not gonna do anything
16:56 for you
16:58 you respect their hurt you respect their
17:00 pain
17:02 and in some cases these events actually
17:04 stunt their growth
17:06 imagine uh the
17:11 when you're young people who are older
17:13 than you are yelling at you
17:14 let's just put that away some real basic
17:16 and so as you get older
17:18 you can't listen to anyone older than
17:21 you
17:21 because they just remind you of this
17:24 this
17:25 weird tyrannical world you were in
17:28 your own personal prison and so you just
17:32 have a
17:33 jaded thing against people that are
17:34 older
17:36 or maybe you go into a word stockholm
17:37 syndrome and then you're like
17:39 overly trying to repair the situation
17:43 upward instead of just going
17:46 hey you know what um my flesh is renewed
17:50 every seven years
17:51 every cell in your body refreshes every
17:53 seven years
17:54 that was 20 some odd years ago so i've
17:57 nearly regrown my body three times since
18:00 that happened
18:01 and time to move on
18:05 try not to get a sympathy card out of
18:07 people right because i think that's a
18:09 big one it's
18:10 it's some sort of thing i don't have to
18:11 be responsible in life because i can
18:13 always trace back to something
18:15 that's ancient history you know some of
18:19 us have a personality and i'm definitely
18:20 one of them which is
18:24 when something gets truly severely
18:28 inappropriate oppressive abusive
18:32 i if i can't just leave the situation
18:35 that's always my first recourse just
18:37 leave the situation
18:38 like when i drive cars you know people
18:41 drive badly
18:42 or once in a while and hey there's new
18:43 people in town that don't know that that
18:45 two-lane thing goes down to one lane you
18:46 got to be good
18:48 because you don't know who's from where
18:51 just chill out but if you're in a
18:54 situation like i always told my
18:55 employees
18:58 regardless of how much we need the
19:00 client's money if any of the clients
19:02 employees ever get abusive please
19:03 escalate that to me so that i can
19:06 push it over to management on the other
19:07 side or counsel them through it or get
19:09 to the other side if it gets so severe
19:10 we can't stop it and then
19:12 we'll just figure out where we go from
19:14 here
19:16 and i was on a uh to give an example
19:18 where i implemented this
19:20 i was on a call with our one of our
19:22 biggest clients our multi-million dollar
19:24 client
19:25 and the product was getting close to
19:28 launching
19:29 it was a big big product national brand
19:32 kids were buying dolls and then pulling
19:34 a tag off putting it in a website and
19:36 building like a barbie world in there
19:39 it was big it wasn't barbie franchise
19:41 but we got this conference call
19:43 and they this woman who was supposed to
19:46 be there
19:47 i can't remember she was on time or not
19:52 the chatter was kind of going back and
19:53 forth oh you know
19:55 she'll be here anytime you know and i
19:57 was kind of like what's the deal
20:00 and and someone was like they weren't
20:01 willing to say it on the phone just in
20:03 case they were listening
20:04 my producers just said well she's
20:06 traditional traditionally been fairly
20:08 rude and
20:09 and papa papa now i don't mind rude uh
20:12 up to a point of getting the
20:13 job done in case a bunch of employees
20:15 are slacking off and then you just walk
20:17 in the room
20:18 and the person who's being quote unquote
20:20 rude is really just trying to hurt cats
20:22 and the cats want to pretend like
20:24 the substitute teacher doesn't know what
20:27 the real teacher does that kind of thing
20:29 which would be me i'd be the substitute
20:31 teacher anyway this lady came on and
20:33 sure enough man
20:35 it was epic an epic moment in
20:39 project management i can't remember
20:41 exactly what she said but within
20:43 probably three to five minutes
20:46 this woman was your classical
20:50 alpha female never had authority in her
20:53 life has no respect for other human
20:55 beings
20:56 she's way beyond her capabilities to
20:58 manage a project in my opinion
21:00 and she is just being a [ __ ] on this
21:03 phone call
21:05 and so
21:08 i stepped into the call and just tried
21:11 to calm things down
21:13 and then she
21:16 does one of these i'm sorry who's
21:18 talking right now
21:21 it was even worse than that it was even
21:23 just sort of like who the [ __ ] are you
21:25 to tell me what to do
21:26 on this phone call and so i told her i
21:29 said uh
21:30 i'm the [ __ ] ceo of this game company
21:32 that you're calling right now and these
21:34 are my employees
21:35 i said uh i don't allow anyone to abuse
21:37 my employees i said everybody here is
21:39 with zero g games you hang up the phone
21:41 right now
21:42 that [ __ ] was fired by the end of the
21:44 night
21:46 i don't put up with that [ __ ]
21:49 so here's here's the lesson of why that
21:52 little examples in this le
21:53 in this uh i was going to say lesson in
21:56 this monolith stone here
21:57 called an episode uh and by the way
22:00 those of you who got the finale of the
22:02 intro
22:02 there's a special cookie for you the
22:05 reason why i'm bringing all the
22:06 monoliths to earth is that they're all
22:07 lessons
22:08 they're all episodes
22:12 if we had all cowered down to this woman
22:14 on that phone call we would have
22:16 installed
22:16 most likely some minor ptsd into
22:19 ourselves where we
22:20 should have stood up for ourselves but
22:22 instead of standing up for ourselves we
22:24 cowered down and went back in and got
22:25 some more
22:27 i find that for those that are abused or
22:29 either they were so
22:31 young that no one came to their help
22:35 even if they were smart enough and
22:36 brilliant enough as a young person to
22:39 complain to the adults
22:41 and then their adult betrays them and
22:42 stabs them in the back
22:45 unforgivable in my opinion i mean i got
22:48 no problem
22:50 uh driving a knife right in their
22:52 [ __ ] face man just say i'm never
22:54 talking to you again i'm sorry
22:55 you're a piece of [ __ ] human being uh
22:57 you know you didn't defend me when i was
22:59 a kid and you're no better today
23:02 see you i don't want to hear your voice
23:05 sorry
23:06 i don't have any uh thumb i need to suck
23:08 with your
23:09 sound of your voice on it man
23:13 so if you don't stick up for yourself
23:15 these events become more permanent and
23:17 more damaging in my opinion
23:18 because as you get older you can stick
23:20 over yourself if nothing else i mean it
23:22 depends on if you live in communist
23:23 china or something
23:24 as long as you live in a free country
23:27 you don't need a job
23:30 if you're being abused and i mean make
23:32 sure you're not being just a wimp
23:34 as long as you know you're showing up
23:35 for work and you're serious about things
23:39 you don't deserve abuse on any level
23:40 whatsoever
23:43 and what'll end up happening is i think
23:45 you will reforge these
23:47 these moments that are going to
23:48 otherwise traumatize you for the rest of
23:50 your life
23:51 and you will reforge them as moments of
23:54 valor
23:56 in your past it will become the bedrock
23:59 of which you build the rest of your home
24:01 on
24:01 which is your life
24:05 and you can get drunk with that so be
24:07 careful you can't get to the point where
24:09 you're just
24:10 looking to be offended so that you can
24:11 have another moment of valor
24:13 again be an alpha male and an omega
24:15 female and these things won't have any
24:17 problems
24:19 if you're a really good rooted human
24:21 being all you want to do is just get to
24:23 the next amazing thing
24:25 and let me uh give you an example where
24:27 i have yearned for the opposite
24:30 in other people
24:33 one of the things that drove me nuts
24:35 about being a prince fan was that
24:37 he could care less about the last album
24:39 he wrote
24:41 even though it's the one that you know
24:42 it's the last one that blew my mind
24:45 he didn't like playing his old songs
24:46 when you asked him what's your favorite
24:48 song you wrote
24:49 he would say the last one that he wrote
24:51 and i always thought that's so stupid
24:53 you have so many good songs you can't
24:54 say that
24:56 if you wrote a song better than your old
24:57 songs then you'd have a number one song
24:59 every day
25:02 but now i get it as an older person
25:05 that was a very important personality
25:08 trait of prince
25:09 because if he had lived in the past all
25:11 he would make was the past all of his
25:13 songs would sound the same
25:15 and we would have drifted off a long
25:17 time ago and probably called him a hack
25:19 instead he made every album sound
25:22 completely and utterly different
25:24 and that's part of his legacy now when i
25:27 met cool jay
25:28 once i talked about you know
25:31 actually you know what i don't even
25:32 think i said anything it was when he
25:34 mixed his first album
25:35 over the internet or first song or
25:37 whatever and he
25:39 he told me he was just yelling at the
25:40 room he just goes you know everybody
25:42 wants me to go back and make the old
25:43 stuff again
25:46 and he goes i'm not interested in the
25:47 past i'm interested in the present
25:49 the future you know i heard it again and
25:52 i was like oh man i sure would like to
25:54 have just
25:54 you know 20 songs drop one it's kind of
25:56 old i need a beat kind of thing right
26:01 unless well let's put it this way
26:05 unless you think you are the very best
26:07 you could possibly ever be
26:08 in every metric that you could possibly
26:10 slice yourself into
26:12 meaning a mental superiority
26:15 of your own making meaning you're not
26:18 better than someone else is not what i'm
26:19 saying
26:20 you probably are but the idea is you
26:22 haven't reached your apex of mental
26:25 capability depending on your age you may
26:27 have already reached your
26:29 physical capability your your apex
26:32 but then again there's your apex for
26:34 every age that you are
26:35 it's the apex for the present are you
26:38 the best that you can be in the present
26:40 and i really try not to talk like that
26:41 too much because
26:43 come on um that's a very stressful
26:45 lifestyle
26:47 i gotta eat perfect food every single
26:48 day i gotta exercise every single day i
26:52 mean your life would become a loop
26:54 of trying to keep every little thing
26:55 perfect across the top
26:57 that's not realistic
27:00 so you're gonna have to do the old round
27:02 robin you've got several things and
27:04 you're going in a circle and sometimes
27:07 at some point in the year there's winter
27:09 things that you do that you don't do
27:10 because it's cold outside
27:12 or yeah there's summer things that you
27:15 can do
27:16 because you can go outside so you're
27:17 less inside and so you rotate your
27:19 schedule
27:20 rotate what you want but now imagine
27:23 no matter what day it is out of the year
27:26 what comes out of your mouth is the same
27:28 old story
27:30 it's a loop and imagine
27:33 you got like a black mirror thing right
27:35 where it's uh
27:38 you put those video taped eyeballs in in
27:41 somebody
27:42 and then it's like okay if you ever
27:43 repeat this stupid story of yours
27:48 uh there's some penalty
27:52 and you're sitting there going oh my god
27:54 i have to live in the present now
27:56 i mean imagine that imagine there was a
27:59 twilight zone where a guy was
28:02 a a loudmouth at a gentleman's club just
28:05 talked incessantly
28:06 and i get a sense the actor wasn't like
28:08 this in real life but he did such a good
28:10 job
28:10 and so a rich guy walked over to him and
28:12 said i'll bet you five hundred thousand
28:14 dollars
28:15 that you can't shut your mouth for one
28:17 year
28:19 or i because i can build a little room
28:21 downstairs you get in there it's got
28:23 microphones recording
28:24 constantly so if you ever talk we're
28:26 going to find out
28:27 but you got to be quiet for five hundred
28:29 thousand dollars
28:31 and the guy takes him up on the bed
28:34 in the end he does it
28:38 and there's some twists i won't spoil
28:41 for if you haven't seen it but imagine
28:44 you flip that and you're like you can't
28:46 talk about the past
28:48 outside of these little checkpoints in
28:50 the video game
28:51 you know if you get to the little mario
28:54 brothers
28:55 flag in the building at the end then you
28:57 can kind of reminisce a little bit
28:59 because we all do but this cannot be a
29:01 daily churn of everything that you do
29:05 i got a buddy buy a couple fancy cars in
29:07 the last uh six months
29:09 i kid you not he owns the car now he
29:13 drives the car
29:14 every day whatever one he wants he can
29:16 drive either one of them
29:19 but he will go onto youtube and
29:22 watch just videos about the car that he
29:25 owns
29:27 and you're sitting there going let me
29:29 get this straight
29:31 30 feet from where you're sitting the
29:33 car exists and it's parked in the
29:35 parking lot
29:37 you could actually go and get in it and
29:39 drive it around in
29:41 southern california with the beach three
29:44 miles
29:44 in fact he's probably two miles from the
29:46 beach
29:48 maybe meet a girl maybe just look cool
29:51 maybe just feel some power
29:55 one's a ferrari for god's sakes but he'd
29:58 rather be at home
29:59 or you know whatever and watching a
30:01 youtube video
30:02 of the reality that he could actually go
30:04 live all right
30:06 tell me who's winning that game i guess
30:09 the ferrari because it keeps low mileage
30:10 i don't know
30:13 i have not found that
30:16 my past helps me accomplish much in the
30:20 future
30:22 or the present i should say i should
30:23 stop saying future
30:26 i haven't you know you can you can maybe
30:29 sit somebody down
30:30 you're smoking cigars and somebody's
30:32 like yeah what do you do and
30:33 yeah you get into it and who'd you work
30:36 for and if the guy's drilling then yeah
30:38 we
30:38 pull up some pretty fun stuff to talk
30:39 about
30:41 but at no point at the end of the
30:42 conversation does anyone go
30:45 well i think i'd like to hire you for my
30:47 job all right for this job run my
30:48 company whatever
30:50 it's just just as bad as the pathetic
30:53 [ __ ] website called linkedin.com
30:57 i hired you because of your profile
30:59 linkedin
31:01 said no one ever it is a
31:04 worthless use of your time let me tell
31:07 you
31:08 anybody who's using that all they need
31:10 is a
31:11 pdf of your resume that supplants that
31:15 entire site
31:16 the rest is a bunch of liberals virtue
31:20 signaling all over the place to see
31:21 to basically prove on linkedin i care
31:24 more than you do
31:25 oh oh you posted that that uh i know the
31:28 kid dying of cancer well i posted a kid
31:31 with hydrocephalic condition i
31:33 therefore i win you know i mean that's
31:34 linkedin it's unbelievable that place
31:39 with today's sort of disciplines as well
31:43 in the workforce realm what part of your
31:46 past is relevant today
31:48 in the 21st century i mean maybe if you
31:51 made cigars
31:53 for the last 40 years you know blends
31:56 and
31:56 your blender or you know production
31:59 pipelining or something maybe you have
32:01 value because
32:02 that's just an art that doesn't change
32:04 but how many jobs are like that
32:06 that are left in the world
32:09 even mundane jobs you would be like okay
32:11 i'm a blender i've got 40 years
32:13 experience
32:14 and the company goes uh okay we'll go
32:16 over to that computer over there
32:19 and i want you to model the chem the
32:21 chemical
32:22 uh composition of your blend and the
32:24 guy's like what
32:27 no no i'll just smell the leaves i'll
32:29 smoke them i'll figure out what the
32:30 blend is
32:31 i know the farms and other rotations i
32:33 know how the rain came and didn't come
32:35 and
32:36 whatever no no we've upgraded we've
32:38 upgraded into computers because that
32:40 makes us feel important
32:42 so a lot of great simple meat potato
32:44 jobs have been
32:47 upgraded out of the capability of the
32:49 individuals
32:51 who normally do it for no reason
32:54 whatsoever
32:56 the thing is is we always talk about
32:57 loops on the outside don't we
33:00 you go in these loops and your brain
33:01 forgets them because they're useless
33:03 to your memory they have no they have no
33:05 point in being memorized
33:06 so as you get older like it's faster
33:08 because you don't remember
33:10 you know more of your reality let's go
33:13 inside the mind of someone who is
33:14 constantly
33:17 trying to get a trophy for something
33:19 that happened to them in the past
33:21 at some point their brain is just simply
33:26 waiting to find a new person
33:29 i love meeting new people well me too
33:33 some people like meeting new people
33:35 because they get to say their story
33:38 again i've got multiple friends who do
33:41 this
33:42 well i tell you i did this you know you
33:44 know i was in the air force and then i
33:46 worked for disneyland and
33:47 it's just like hey i'm really glad you
33:49 did those things and i appreciate your
33:50 service
33:52 but you just you already told me that
33:55 oh i did oh well let me tell you it
33:57 again uh i probably store i didn't tell
33:59 you it's like dude i don't want to hear
34:00 anything about your past
34:01 i didn't solicit your past out of you
34:03 that's not part of our conversation
34:06 what are you doing right now oh oh
34:09 gosh what am i doing right now i spent
34:11 all my life inside the past
34:14 now here's here's the second half of
34:16 this
34:18 if one loses the capability to forge the
34:20 present
34:22 because they are living in the past what
34:25 sort of future would you predict for
34:26 them
34:28 what sort of future
34:32 zero future downhill
34:36 in terms of success downhill in terms of
34:39 happiness because hey man
34:43 i don't know about you but is the world
34:45 getting much easier to live in
34:47 no it's becoming so crazy
34:51 that those of us that are red pilled and
34:54 awake we're wondering whether or not
34:55 this place will be free
34:57 in 10 years whether or not we'll even be
34:59 alive in 10 years right
35:01 i didn't make agenda 2030. they did i
35:04 didn't write the zoning
35:05 laws for human allowance in the 2030
35:09 year
35:10 they did i didn't reduce world
35:12 population 99
35:14 they did
35:17 so you're telling me there's nothing to
35:18 worry about forging the present
35:21 fighting for the president becoming
35:22 aware of the present
35:24 hmm not sure that works out
35:29 cost of living keeps going up wages
35:31 aren't going up
35:33 the simpler occupations that are out
35:37 there
35:38 are getting gobbled up because
35:39 everyone's unemployed
35:42 so let's say there's a profession out
35:43 there that it's sort of an entry-level
35:46 transitional position
35:47 that most people do before they get
35:50 their big job
35:52 whether we still need experts in those
35:54 jobs that that
35:55 actually devote their entire life to
35:57 those jobs we do
35:59 otherwise it never perfects it never
36:01 goes to the next level
36:03 standards are lost the second the great
36:05 employee leaves and the
36:06 new ones arrive that need to be trained
36:08 there's no one to train them so all the
36:09 mistakes come back all the
36:11 bad reviews for a particular business
36:13 start to pour in
36:14 so it is important that these jobs
36:18 are manned by individuals meaning
36:21 human however
36:24 look at 2020 how many people are doing
36:27 jobs that they would never
36:30 normally do not because they're too high
36:33 and mighty for the job but because
36:34 that's the only thing they can do
36:36 and they normally do something much more
36:38 sophisticated making more money
36:40 but that company has gone on on hiatus
36:43 gone out of business
36:45 because of this fiasco that we're
36:47 dealing with
36:50 so we know that life is becoming more
36:52 dynamic by the
36:54 minute don't we meaning you
36:57 can't just say i i know how to do
36:59 computer science so
37:01 i'll always be employed and i'll always
37:02 be a computer scientist
37:05 i was just talking to a guy today sort
37:08 of unrelated
37:10 there was definitely a barrier of
37:13 being able to deal with reality in this
37:16 conversation which was
37:18 i was trying to make the point that
37:20 because this kid was becoming a computer
37:22 scientist and he was going to go into
37:23 cryptology or some
37:25 sort of security which is great and he
37:26 has an artery to the military which is
37:28 good because that's where that
37:29 career is going to thrive and that's
37:30 exactly what i told him
37:32 but i said you know on average becoming
37:34 a computer scientist today
37:36 is a joke one we get undercut by foreign
37:39 countries
37:41 the second that technology solidifies
37:44 and i said
37:45 you know whatever you know today is
37:46 obsolete in a couple years
37:48 oh they still program in it but it's
37:50 it's now being deprecated
37:52 and you can't possibly track all the
37:54 languages that are out there
37:55 the guy was like oh man i probably read
37:57 like 12 papers a a week or something
38:00 like that on new languages and it's like
38:02 dude if you don't have a project in that
38:04 language that you've never programmed in
38:06 then there's no way you can be an expert
38:08 at anything
38:10 you know how many languages i've read
38:11 the white papers on
38:13 and it makes complete sense but the
38:15 second you actually need to use it
38:17 stuff don't work because documentation
38:19 was out of date or
38:20 hey man how do i talk to the i o port on
38:22 this computer i need to suck some stuff
38:23 off a usb
38:25 serial port and do this special thing no
38:27 one's ever done before
38:28 you have to have killer projects to
38:31 learn something
38:32 i wanted to learn blender 3d i did that
38:34 ufo
38:36 thing which was definitely challenging
38:37 but man the new intro
38:39 was a ball kicker man i mean it was but
38:42 i'm very glad i did it and i'm still
38:44 repairing that intro to this day
38:48 we can't simply say
38:51 to everyone at least i think especially
38:55 to females
38:56 because they're seeing things on a much
38:57 more left or sorry right brain
39:00 dimension that i think that men we just
39:02 need to
39:04 we need to take a step back and accept
39:08 that there's a genetic
39:10 difference between the two of us we
39:11 obviously know that's the case but i
39:13 mean there's a level
39:14 of perception i think that happens with
39:16 obviously every human being between each
39:18 other but obviously between male and
39:20 female
39:21 with a male won't take in or allow in at
39:24 least
39:24 all of the elements of hurt that deal
39:28 with
39:30 a painful situation something bad
39:32 happens men just tend to kind of
39:34 lock up and and we try to fight it out
39:36 of our existence
39:38 or we just go well i i can't make that
39:41 work let's go do something else
39:43 and then we flush it down the drain
39:46 we just aren't typically the kind of
39:48 people that
39:49 carry stuff forward the men i have found
39:52 are more
39:53 into positive past
39:56 obsessions and women are more
40:00 involved with trauma past situations
40:04 so a woman will typically tell me did i
40:06 tell you this bad thing happened to me a
40:07 long time ago
40:08 well and then they'll just dramatize it
40:10 in front of you as if it happened two
40:12 seconds ago
40:14 and you're like wow you really work hard
40:18 to completely bring back this horrible
40:20 moment in your life and why would you do
40:22 that
40:23 what benefit is it to you to
40:27 to relive something maybe
40:30 physically traumatic mentally traumatic
40:33 why would you do that
40:36 ptsd is a different thing ptsd is an
40:39 event
40:39 a traumatic event that's lost in the
40:41 consciousness of a human being
40:45 that is you feel horrible as if it just
40:48 happened to you because you don't
40:49 remember why you feel horrible and you
40:50 don't remember that it happened to you
40:52 you have to go search it and find it and
40:54 once a guy finds it
40:55 he kills it and it's gone those are the
40:59 successful ptsd things
41:01 and even if there's a little morsel in
41:02 there where you're like i can't quite
41:04 remember something weird happened right
41:05 there
41:06 you just go well i feel better that i
41:08 know it's there and that that was
41:10 nagging at me and now i can just ignore
41:12 the nag
41:13 but at least i know where it came from i
41:16 got friends of mine that are coming to
41:17 me you know or we'll just be talking and
41:19 they'll say you know i think my uncle
41:21 might have touched me when i was a kid
41:24 i was like okay well i'm very
41:26 appreciative of you sharing that with me
41:28 why do you think that and you know
41:29 well he kind of chased me around one
41:31 time and i think he had all of his
41:33 clothes
41:34 on and stuff but i can't remember him
41:36 doing anything so i'm not going to let
41:37 it really
41:38 affect me today but the more he was
41:41 thinking maybe he'll recapture the
41:43 memory
41:45 but at no point is the exact guy who
41:47 told me that story
41:48 going to be going in for a job interview
41:51 and be thinking about his uncle touching
41:53 him and
41:53 whether or not that happened or not and
41:56 then tank at the interview
41:59 he's going to man up and do it the other
42:02 one though is to overcompensate
42:06 and i've mentioned this million years
42:09 ago but we had a woman come into
42:10 electronic arts
42:12 i wasn't introduced to her she just
42:15 literally showed up at a meeting
42:17 and i think her thing was i think she
42:20 was maybe in marketing or something
42:23 she looked great she looked amazing
42:25 really professional
42:26 super professional almost too
42:28 professional for a video game
42:30 company in one way but i was always very
42:33 happy when that dna came in the company
42:34 because i'm like
42:35 good you know we need a little bit of
42:37 that dna just a little drop of like
42:39 super professional corporatism
42:41 inside of this crazy place with all
42:43 these kids
42:44 with candy bars in their back pockets
42:46 you know but she came into this meeting
42:49 that we were having and it's a co-ed
42:52 meeting i mean ea was pretty good about
42:54 hiring
42:54 at least in the internet division lots
42:57 of emails lots of males
42:58 and very powerful positions for both but
43:01 she
43:02 stopped the meeting during the
43:04 introduction of herself
43:06 and went on this little rant
43:10 to let us all know in the room and even
43:12 talking to the women as if they were
43:14 involved or genetically capable of doing
43:16 this
43:17 she said you know uh something to the
43:19 effect of
43:21 she's here she wasn't in any senior
43:23 position i was over her a couple levels
43:26 but she was like and i'm not gonna let
43:27 any men tell me what to do and it was
43:29 just one of those kind of
43:31 san francisco liberal
43:34 monologues and i was so like i remember
43:37 looking at her like
43:39 gosh like 60 seconds before you went on
43:42 this
43:43 crazy rant of yours i thought you were
43:45 going to be one of the coolest people
43:46 that just joined the company
43:48 and now i think you should leave you
43:50 know in my brain i was like
43:51 uh-oh we can't keep this dna in here
43:54 because this is like
43:55 a woman on the edge she's just ready to
43:57 sue the company for some
43:59 i don't know discrimination or something
44:02 on probably our third day
44:04 however to her defense
44:08 here she is utterly paranoid schizo
44:12 paranoid about being repressed by men
44:15 her division needed its own server
44:20 but real quick story she asked for a
44:21 server it was taking a long time because
44:24 the it group was just backed up trying
44:25 to
44:26 literally put together hundreds of
44:27 servers and do a big disk array and all
44:29 this other stuff
44:30 so she makes a phone call to one of the
44:31 guys who's one of the nicest guys on
44:33 planet earth
44:34 definitely respects women but he had a
44:36 busted flip phone
44:37 that when he shut the phone it wouldn't
44:39 actually kill the call
44:41 sometimes and so she left a voicemail
44:44 with him hey you know it's been about
44:46 so many days and i think i should have
44:47 my server by now can you please fill me
44:49 in
44:49 so he calls her back to leave a
44:51 voicemail in a room full of men
44:54 and leaves her real pleasant voicemail
44:56 that you know we're working really hard
44:58 should have you up by next week or
44:59 whatever and then he closes the phone
45:01 and he makes a joke across the table
45:03 yeah you'll get your server you know
45:05 probably next year or something or
45:06 whatever i don't know what he said
45:07 but anyway everyone laughed and that was
45:09 all going into her voicemail
45:12 and so she attracted the future
45:15 that she wanted she wanted to be abused
45:19 and that's what she got am i blaming her
45:22 no
45:23 but if law of attraction is true maybe
45:25 little
45:28 thing is you can't go to a football game
45:32 and then just stand on one side of the
45:34 end zone and then
45:35 accuse the other side you better not
45:36 play dirty you better not play hard
45:39 you know and then they're just gonna go
45:41 oh okay
45:42 i guess we won't hey don't hit so hard
45:45 okay guys
45:47 no life doesn't work like that does it
45:50 you got to get up you got to punch life
45:53 in the balls
45:54 and and run past it while it's been over
45:57 that's what life requires in the world
46:00 that i have seen
46:01 if you're able to live a privileged life
46:03 where no nothing bad happens to you you
46:05 married your high school sweethearts you
46:07 live in your hometown
46:08 money's been rolling in you got four
46:10 kids your parents are
46:11 80 years old probably only 120. you're
46:14 an anomaly
46:15 and that's a wonderful thing the world
46:18 envies you
46:20 but considering that most the people
46:23 live in these demonic
46:24 major city areas of the world i don't
46:27 think the majority of the world has that
46:29 privilege
46:30 nor the knowledge of what that
46:32 experience even feels like or that it's
46:34 even possible to do
46:36 part of not living in the past is you
46:38 gotta hustle your present
46:41 at the same time you can't let your past
46:44 keep the bar at the bottom right oh
46:48 i you know i i guess i'll just do this
46:51 this
46:52 minimum thing i can do to exist
46:56 well gosh i mean we're literally
47:00 i mean there were episodes i hate doing
47:02 this to you guys
47:03 but there were episodes of twilight zone
47:04 in the 60s about machines taking over
47:07 the
47:07 all employable work
47:10 and we have now got boston dynamics
47:12 robots running around
47:14 climbing on junk piles pulling dummies
47:16 out of fake
47:17 earthquake simulations and you think
47:20 that your job is secure
47:22 okay so if you're 99 years old and
47:26 your little putter in your chest is
47:27 starting to end i get it
47:29 you've been retired for 20 30 years i
47:32 get it
47:32 but if you're young and you're vibrant
47:35 and you're going to need a job in 10
47:36 years and you don't have any money in
47:37 the bank for
47:39 retirement or whatever and you're not
47:40 quite sure whatever social security kind
47:42 of program you have in your country is
47:43 going to work
47:45 they're depopulating the freaking world
47:47 so what youth is going to put money into
47:49 a system
47:49 to pay you to live
47:52 china just figured that out japan just
47:54 figured that out
47:56 america just figured that out and the
47:59 thing is is
48:02 usually as you get older your physical
48:04 capabilities start to deteriorate so
48:07 it depends on what your vocation is
48:11 to get you into whatever job
48:15 maybe that job all the jobs are at the
48:17 low end level because you keep setting
48:18 your bar
48:19 low and you're not going anywhere maybe
48:24 you can't physically pull off the jobs
48:26 that are left
48:27 and then what you're gonna find a place
48:30 to tell people your past
48:31 is that really gonna knock it out the
48:33 park for you
48:35 it's not gonna do anything it's gonna
48:36 guarantee there's a ditch with your name
48:39 on it
48:42 again i think i'm talking to people that
48:43 know people like this more than people
48:45 that do this
48:48 this is one of those conversations that
48:50 in my hometown would typically come out
48:52 of like um
48:54 an uncle that has been through the
48:56 machine
48:58 in my if you're from a little town it
48:59 would be the uncle that moved to the big
49:01 city for
49:01 20 30 years did something
49:05 fairly significant or whatever i mean in
49:07 terms of pain
49:08 and just toiling great things into the
49:11 world
49:12 and then they come back they're talking
49:15 to their nephews their nieces and
49:16 they're
49:17 mainly nephews because there's usually
49:20 an alignment the aunts talk to the
49:21 nieces and the
49:23 uncles talk to the nephews but they hear
49:26 your idealistic approach from a child
49:29 let's just say
49:30 and they let it all come out and then
49:32 they ask a couple questions and then
49:33 they just turn to you and then just
49:35 mow you down and give you the the real
49:38 deal man
49:40 my cousin slash he's really my cousin
49:43 but i call my uncle larry
49:45 it's my dad's age my dad's first cousin
49:48 you know he i tell i did an episode
49:50 called my cousin
49:52 larry our cousin larry because he passed
49:54 away
49:56 i think way ahead of his time but he was
49:59 uh listening to me talk about how i was
50:00 going to leave california go to the
50:02 midwest and go to college to get
50:05 certified in what i already knew
50:08 here i was a lead engineer lead designer
50:12 i pounded out a bunch of wild stuff and
50:15 had my own companies and all of a sudden
50:16 i'm talking about this thing
50:18 and i think i was about 23 years old
50:22 and he listened to me he listened to me
50:24 all the way to the very end and he
50:25 always had this enchanting smile
50:28 and he put a big smile on his face and
50:30 he said he says
50:32 why why are you going to college again i
50:35 said well because you know some
50:36 some companies need to see the piece of
50:38 paper and he looked at me and i
50:40 i'm just paraphrasing what i remember he
50:42 said but he said
50:44 do you really want to work for anyone
50:45 who doesn't trust your background
50:47 who doesn't trust the interview process
50:50 and he goes aren't you doing what you
50:53 already love
50:54 to do and i was like yeah yeah
50:57 and just within five minutes this dude
51:00 canceled a huge plan that i had to move
51:04 i mean it was a big deal
51:06 i've been in california i guess um about
51:09 six years at the time
51:12 and he kept me here and because of him
51:17 at one he infused in me new confidence
51:20 in my present
51:22 he also
51:25 helped me build confidence from my past
51:27 right so you button up your entire past
51:30 and it becomes literally the voltage
51:32 rating on the battery
51:35 and so i went off and more confidently
51:38 conquered my future because of my past i
51:42 knew where i came from so i knew where i
51:44 was
51:44 going or where i could go
51:48 now let's let's go back and review
51:52 the couple species i put together as a
51:55 more advice-bound
51:56 conclusion to this sort of thing
52:01 it's a hell of a thing to tell yourself
52:02 that the greatest things that you have
52:04 created in your life or accomplished in
52:05 your life
52:06 are strictly in your past
52:09 meaning okay to the degree you worship
52:12 your past
52:13 like a video i got guys watching videos
52:15 that happened 30
52:17 years ago like it happened yesterday
52:20 30 years ago so what have you been doing
52:24 in the meantime man
52:25 and what could you possibly do with your
52:27 present if all you do is keep looking at
52:30 the past and with
52:32 no interest to actually engage the past
52:34 in your present
52:35 so maybe you maybe you go back and
52:37 you're like man i when i was in my
52:39 teenager
52:41 when i picked up a guitar i just wrote a
52:43 song instantaneously i take it down to a
52:45 local club and play it and people love
52:47 me and i made lots of money
52:49 maybe i should pick up a guitar again
52:50 because maybe i still got that talent
52:52 that makes sense to me instead of just
52:55 going
52:55 have i shown you the tip of me playing
52:57 at the bookstore that one time
52:59 ping and it's the only thing good that
53:02 ever happened
53:03 according to your own perception of
53:05 yourself not our perception of you
53:08 if we're your friend there's something
53:10 happen in the present
53:12 that makes us like you so let's say
53:15 something really bad happens to you in
53:17 the past
53:19 usually the way i've seen this is that
53:23 if the conditions of which the past
53:27 occurred
53:28 and tortured you if
53:31 well i'd say to the degree that those
53:33 events can happen again
53:35 in the future or slash present i get the
53:38 psychosis
53:40 let's say uh you're walking out of a
53:42 grocery store
53:43 and a pervert rapist whatever
53:47 follows you to your car if you're a guy
53:50 it's just someone want to knock you on
53:51 the head
53:52 and steal your money maybe even kill you
53:55 and you get held up at gunpoint
53:57 but those events of walking out of the
53:59 grocery store are going to happen
54:01 meaning just the innocent event of you
54:03 walking out of the front door going to
54:04 your car packing your stuff up and going
54:07 you know you want to go in daylight but
54:08 i mean ted bundy worked in the daylight
54:11 almost categorically there's no safety
54:15 in some of those situations but if the
54:17 conditions that
54:18 torture did in the past are constantly
54:20 coming up i get the fear
54:22 and something needs to change something
54:24 needs to change to break that
54:25 loop you either have to go with someone
54:28 else every time you go to the grocery
54:29 store for a little while until you break
54:31 it or you order stuff online
54:32 do something different to break those
54:34 circumstances but
54:35 i've never heard that be the case and
54:38 the examples that i have seen
54:40 they were very very unique situations
54:44 some of which because these people are
54:45 no longer children it can't happen again
54:49 it can't happen again
54:53 i've heard of stories where you know
54:55 boyfriends have been abusive
54:57 for a really long time just one thing
54:59 after the other after the other after
55:01 the other
55:02 and part of it's like doctor it hurts
55:04 when i do this
55:05 and you go stop doing it then right
55:09 that is why i mentioned at the beginning
55:11 of the episode
55:12 you need to make sure that abusive
55:14 behavior towards you
55:16 and that's your definition that's not
55:17 anyone else's definition
55:20 now if you're made of marshmallows uh
55:23 yeah you'll probably die alone because
55:25 everything is going to be too harsh for
55:26 a marshmallow
55:28 but believe it or not there's some
55:29 marshmallows out there you can hang out
55:31 with
55:31 you may not respect or be attracted to
55:33 them but that's sort of
55:36 what you got yourself into if you're too
55:40 malleable and too sensitive to exist in
55:43 the real world
55:45 but sometimes people are completely
55:46 normal and people are just jerks to them
55:50 physically mentally or both
55:53 well how many times do you need to get
55:55 punched in the face
55:56 before you go hey i don't really like
55:59 getting punched in the face
56:00 it's pretty traumatic physically it's
56:02 pretty traumatic
56:03 mentally because i feel defeated
56:07 and so i don't think i'm going to get in
56:08 a situation where i want to get punched
56:09 in the face
56:11 you say i love you man now if you're
56:16 richard harris or you're gene hackman
56:20 then yeah you do go to bars to get into
56:22 fights and you love it
56:23 for whatever reason those two dudes were
56:25 just
56:26 soccer thugs man they they dug it
56:30 it but both of them grew out of it
56:32 eventually
56:34 that's just some weird latent rite of
56:36 passage or something i don't know
56:39 but i don't think they're complaining
56:40 about it now if someone is like
56:44 a retired top gun pilot a retired
56:48 actor musician and they're simply not
56:50 doing it anymore
56:51 and maybe little fly outs here and there
56:53 but
56:55 and they're celebrities and they go on
56:56 television shows radio shows podcasts or
56:59 they're just an interesting person and
57:02 you know someone wants to ask keith
57:03 richards what it was like to be keith
57:04 richards
57:05 i get that but i think what you'll find
57:09 is
57:09 if you were alone with keith richards
57:13 he wouldn't mention the past unless it
57:15 had some sort of educational example
57:17 or alignment with what's happening at
57:20 that exact moment
57:22 imagine sitting on a porch with keith
57:25 and you're drinking some
57:26 whatever and you're just watching
57:28 traffic go by
57:31 and some weird bread van comes by or
57:33 something and he goes oh man look at
57:34 that old van man we used to have a van
57:36 like that when we first
57:38 went on tour man that's really weird i
57:40 haven't seen that in a really long time
57:42 there you go he's just reminiscing about
57:44 something that would happen in the
57:45 present
57:46 and it's not a negative it's a positive
57:49 but what if i brought keith a situation
57:51 that happened to me in the present and i
57:52 said man this dude was running down a
57:54 business went bad or i'm just struggling
57:57 with my chick or whatever
57:59 and he's done it all thousands of times
58:02 right
58:03 he's he searches his brain he's he'd be
58:06 he would be my deep thoughts at that
58:07 moment ready go
58:10 well you know it sounds a lot like this
58:12 you know maybe maybe he's thought about
58:13 it so much because he writes lyrics too
58:15 he boils the whole thing down to just
58:17 some little epiphany
58:20 that i need to hear a piece of wisdom i
58:22 need to hear
58:23 those are wonderful things and not what
58:25 i'm talking about
58:27 one of the heartbreakers i run into all
58:29 the time is that
58:31 people fixate on
58:35 past styles and past
58:38 clothing i mean like they we talked
58:41 about this a long time ago where
58:43 you'll have your friends on facebook
58:45 profiles that actually
58:47 still post a photograph of them in high
58:50 school or in college and it's been 30
58:52 plus years since that was a
58:53 an event and so you're sitting there
58:56 going
58:58 really what music do you listen to only
59:02 the past music this is the only music
59:04 that's good
59:05 amen believe me i understand that
59:08 but to be completely disconnected from
59:11 everything if you love music to
59:13 disconnect from some of the great bands
59:14 that are coming out that do
59:16 sort of reprisal uh reprised versions of
59:20 previous styles
59:23 are they real one-dimensional that's
59:26 your choice
59:26 you can do that i love to find some
59:29 eclectic like mode selecta
59:31 some amazing band that's just phenomenal
59:36 and they come and they go they'll make a
59:39 couple great albums and then disappear
59:41 but for that moment you're just
59:42 listening to something that's just out
59:44 of this world berlin techno man i mean
59:46 it's just amazing
59:49 there's a famous saying i think it was a
59:50 tony robbins
59:52 tony robbins is one guy that made it
59:54 really popular which is your past does
59:55 not equal your
59:57 future but man
60:00 i would be hell-bent to convince a few
60:02 people i know that that's the case
60:05 i think one of the formulas in closing
60:07 here
60:09 is trying to use your
60:12 well it's to establish credibility in
60:14 the present
60:17 now there could be points where even i
60:19 do it where
60:21 because it's for me it's super duper
60:23 rare other than this show which is a
60:25 weird
60:26 irony of the whole statement i'm making
60:27 here
60:29 like if you talk to some of my closest
60:31 friends and and
60:33 and ask them about like what i've done
60:36 you'll get some
60:36 little tiny pieces of my past out of
60:39 them but if you're a deep thoughts
60:41 listener you know more about me than
60:44 most of my friends
60:45 in terms of my overall history with the
60:47 universe
60:50 because i just don't do that i just
60:51 don't throw it out there unless it
60:53 becomes part of the conversation
60:56 it's relevant to establishing
60:58 capabilities
61:00 and then i'll pull it out you know
61:01 lightly but one of the things for
61:04 instance
61:05 that that has always plagued my mind is
61:08 when you're at
61:09 a because i talk about joining these
61:11 groups right these people who want to
61:14 [Music]
61:15 think tank things and there's always
61:17 that intro
61:18 zoom call or meeting or whatever where
61:21 they want to go around the room and have
61:22 you talk about
61:24 just a little introduction of who you
61:25 are it used to be that when someone
61:27 asked me what i did for a living
61:29 it was the worst question in the world
61:30 because i was like uh
61:32 how long do you got you know i just
61:35 dreaded the answer because
61:37 at one point it just feels boastish
61:39 almost for me it's like a millisecond
61:41 into talking it feels like i'm bragging
61:44 and i know that's not what's happening
61:46 and i didn't feel like anyone else was
61:47 bragging when they talked about what
61:48 they did
61:50 usually but i just it just makes me want
61:53 to puke when i have to go through that
61:55 whole thing and like oh
61:56 and i did this and i did that and
61:59 because part of it is well are you any
62:01 good today
62:03 whether or not you were amazing in the
62:04 past should be irrelevant
62:07 it does establish your ability to gain
62:10 responsibility and to mitigate
62:14 you know obstacles and that kind of
62:15 thing but i'd almost rather have an
62:18 employee tell me
62:19 you know potential employee tell me look
62:21 here's the thing
62:23 i have a really strong work i think i
62:26 work seven days a week because i love it
62:29 i don't think that anything is
62:31 impossible
62:33 i've been entrusted at the managerial
62:36 level
62:36 many many times i've had this many
62:38 employees in my past at times
62:40 did really really well and i'm just
62:43 almost giving you the verbatim answer
62:44 that would work for me more so
62:46 than the resume now i may ask them a
62:49 couple key questions to say things like
62:52 what's the most significant thing in
62:54 your mind that was
62:55 one the most interesting thing you ever
62:57 worked on and perhaps
62:59 one of the most complex things you ever
63:01 worked on it could be two answers it
63:02 could be one answer
63:04 go and you'll see their face light up
63:06 because all of a sudden now
63:08 they have one of those things
63:12 and i think that's lightning in a bottle
63:13 man it's beautiful
63:17 i don't think you can get those answers
63:19 out of people or out of yourself
63:21 if there's a predominant focus towards
63:23 the past because then
63:25 the answer becomes once upon a time in a
63:28 galaxy long long ago
63:30 and far far away this thing happened and
63:34 so it's kind of like well you know i
63:36 know a lot of guys that were amazing it
63:37 for between 18 and 25 but at 26 they you
63:40 know
63:41 let themselves go let's just put that
63:42 way
63:45 it's who you are right now that matters
63:47 and that's all that matters
63:50 be careful with who you hang out with
63:54 because you need to be aware of how much
63:58 it's affecting you both consciously and
63:59 subconsciously
64:02 if you are striving to be your best
64:05 or if you are in a dire situation that
64:07 you need to get yourself out of
64:09 and i'm just saying that because of 2020
64:12 we've all had to come out of our slumber
64:16 of comfort for those of us that had to
64:20 change our careers
64:22 to make sure that we have the same kind
64:23 of money that we enjoy
64:26 it's not as much as you might love it
64:28 and find
64:29 success in it and whatever it's still
64:33 not intuitively comfortable and so
64:36 that's one reason why i wanted to kind
64:37 of loop in on this this has been
64:38 something kind of nagging at me as i
64:40 sort of live in other people's loops
64:42 constantly
64:44 and i'll hear some people complain about
64:46 their lives i mean just not a positive
64:48 statement out of their mouth about their
64:50 lives
64:51 they're always tired and and god life
64:54 sucks and business sucks and
64:56 just just man picking the worst second
64:58 next constantly
65:01 and then there are others that are
65:03 bright as can be
65:04 but still can't stop talking about the
65:06 past it's like why wouldn't you want to
65:08 talk about the present because a bunch
65:09 of great things are happening right now
65:11 right oh yeah totally and then all
65:12 sudden boom
65:13 you get the story about the present that
65:16 is a true
65:17 double entendre it is a present to hear
65:22 so anyway that's all i got on this one a
65:24 little short episode for you
65:27 please go to deepthoughtsradio.com and
65:28 bookmark that
65:31 please get to bitshoot.com and create
65:32 yourself an account and subscribe over
65:34 there
65:35 it is the replacement for youtube at
65:37 least one really good one
65:38 lbry is also blowing me away i've been
65:41 perusing that a little bit
65:42 i don't think anyone's watched a video
65:44 over there but they don't have any
65:45 metrics to know that that's happening so
65:46 you could be watching it i don't know
65:48 but it's got everything up there the
65:51 only thing i'll mention is
65:52 patreon folks thank you so much for
65:54 supporting the show
65:56 you're truly making it happen i mean
65:57 these shows
65:59 monetarily are all worth hundreds of
66:01 dollars if not thousands of dollars a
66:03 piece
66:03 when i total up my normal average pay
66:05 for how much i spent on every episode
66:07 but
66:08 you guys facilitate things make it
66:11 happen
66:11 so i appreciate it the new format i'm
66:15 trying to go to
66:15 in terms of release schedule is i will
66:17 put it out the night before
66:19 to the patreon folks and then they get a
66:21 chance to watch it for about
66:24 12 hours if not more
66:27 actually probably 16 hours beforehand
66:32 and then it goes out between again 12
66:35 and 2.
66:36 so anyway hopefully that's cool for you
66:39 guys
66:40 anyway take care of yourself and someone
66:41 else and i'll see you in the next deep
