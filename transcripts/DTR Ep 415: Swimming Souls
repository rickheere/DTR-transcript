00:28 welcome back to teeth thoughts ladies
00:30 and gentlemen one of this cool evening
00:34 is August 1st it's about 12:30 in the
00:38 morning so today we're gonna talk about
00:44 souls and I think the title I'm gonna
00:48 use is swimming Souls a little
00:53 provocative yeah we talked about souls I
00:56 got an episode on souls and if you know
01:02 you if you were to say that a the way at
01:05 least in America I don't know if it's
01:07 this way in other countries but when we
01:09 put you in a level one college class but
01:14 typically call it a 101 class right
01:16 psychology 101 French 101 whatever I
01:20 think it goes 202 301 this would be a
01:25 higher level soul conversation so if
01:29 you're into this kind of thing and it's
01:30 going to get at what we are it's gonna
01:34 get into consciousness it's gonna get
01:36 into an ecosystem of souls so a friend
01:41 of mine very brilliant person writer
01:45 director he told me this story and if
01:49 those of you who've listened to every
01:50 single episode way back in your brain
01:52 you've heard this story once before
01:54 only once pretty shortly once I dare
01:59 anyone to prove different but what he
02:03 told me was he was actually telling a
02:04 whole room but he realized I was the
02:06 only person still listening and he said
02:11 that he got in a boat somehow I think
02:14 off the coast of Florida and I think he
02:18 said he was either hallucinating because
02:22 he was out there for so long he almost
02:25 drifted out and died but I don't know if
02:29 he was using any drugs he's not a heavy
02:33 drug user or anything this is way back
02:34 and like I think the 70s when he was
02:37 younger
02:38 I don't know if it was before he got
02:40 married or what the deal was be told me
02:42 a story that at one point he
02:44 hallucinating that just like how fish
02:48 like a dolphins do their migrations in
02:51 the ocean and they just all are going
02:53 together right they're jumping out and
02:54 diving in and jumping out they're really
02:56 big sine cosine wave coming in and out
02:58 of literally the water realm into the
03:01 air realm the oxygen realm that he saw
03:06 an infinite funnel or tube of souls
03:12 jumping in and out of the ocean his
03:16 impression was is that they were very
03:19 content and happy and that this was a
03:22 positive thing he said to me because
03:26 he's telling this story and I think
03:28 people are not deep enough to get what
03:30 he's saying so the move it's his house
03:32 and everyone's moving around at a party
03:34 he was having and he finally turns to me
03:37 and I hadn't really met the guy yet I
03:39 was a fan of his work and he just looks
03:43 at me and he goes he says he said the
03:48 dirty word all I'll put it in a in an
03:50 acronym for you he said we don't leave
03:55 this place MF first and I was like whoa
04:00 that is totally trippy coming from this
04:03 guy I thought man this dude really
04:06 really really has a huge grasp on
04:08 potential realities and potential
04:12 interpretations of consciousness he's
04:15 very famous for writing about that kind
04:17 of thing and so that story just to stuck
04:22 with me because it's so visual he's a
04:25 visual person he writes screenplays so
04:27 and he directs films so it's like you
04:29 see these things right I thought he did
04:32 a great job so you know we've talked
04:36 about consciousness and souls and God
04:40 and just you know the matrix versus ten
04:43 different shapes the world might be you
04:47 know again I this is going to be a
04:49 conversation way
04:51 way beyond any geometry of where we are
04:54 okay you know we've toyed with the
04:57 notion that we are God we are all one
05:02 big giant being that is simply spread
05:08 out and this you know this world is our
05:14 temporary existence simply to get
05:18 through infinity you have to forget who
05:21 you were and you have to be reborn and
05:23 you have to re-experience the limited
05:26 amount of stuff that there is to
05:28 experience as much as we might be able
05:31 to mathematically conceive of a bunch of
05:33 different experiences you know I don't
05:36 know what do we experience in this world
05:40 you know when you write screenplays
05:44 there's you know there's a color wheel
05:46 and the color wheel is the most one of
05:48 most brilliant things for artists
05:50 because the color on the other side of
05:51 the wheel is complementary to the color
05:53 you started with as long as you just
05:55 drive it right the line right through
05:56 the center from the color that you're on
05:58 the one you hit it goes really well with
05:59 the one that you picked
06:00 so like gold and blue will be across
06:03 from each other it is brilliant how that
06:07 thing is put together but there's a
06:08 emotional wheel that is also created for
06:13 screenwriting where it's good and evil
06:16 and happiness and sadness and you know
06:19 all these different and then there's
06:20 another ring outside of that for the
06:21 deeper scripts that starts to go to the
06:23 more subtle things like indifference you
06:25 know or perhaps sympathy is on the outer
06:31 ring certainly feels like it is today
06:32 it's not it's not a prime color of
06:35 emotional experience these days but I
06:39 struggle with this notion of okay we're
06:43 here now where the hell did we come from
06:46 you know chicken-and-egg where did we
06:49 come from to us there are things that
06:52 aren't alive and things that are alive
06:54 things that are alive typically get
06:57 depending if they look a lot like us we
06:59 start to consider them to have the
07:02 attributes that we have the machinery
07:04 that we have and I
07:05 give an example those of you who have
07:08 dogs and cats that you're very fond of
07:10 or you've had them in your lifetime
07:13 you'll swear they have a soul a person
07:17 without pets will say no they definitely
07:19 don't have souls why would they have
07:21 souls
07:21 they're not human they're not good
07:23 enough to have a soul I mean I've heard
07:25 people say that my lifetime it's so
07:27 silly but then you ask yourself does a
07:30 cow have one does a coyote yet when is a
07:32 bear have one does that fish who doesn't
07:34 seem to do much but just look at you
07:37 know just do a little drinking breathing
07:40 exercise and grabs a piece of fish does
07:42 that thing ever soul we tend to think
07:45 that souls have this extra level of
07:48 consciousness this ability to desire to
07:51 communicate a dog communicates a cat
07:54 communicates I mean it really really
07:56 communicates but then you see a swan on
08:00 the edge of a riverbank feeding fish
08:04 taking something and feeding fish
08:06 there's the Swan that walks around on
08:08 the internet and cleans up this garden
08:11 you just think I don't know where this
08:13 came from I don't know if this is I
08:15 don't think you have pet swans it just
08:17 happened to show up and they're both
08:18 black swans I believe but the thing
08:20 would just go around and pick up
08:21 anything that didn't look normal and
08:23 move it to a place and get rid of it and
08:25 never use it for a nest or anything it's
08:28 manicuring a garden as if some
08:31 incredible Japanese garden or or like a
08:34 Mexican gardener where these guys just
08:37 have this meticulous nature I mean
08:39 doesn't have to be a particular race but
08:40 those are two races that are very famous
08:42 for just botany just beautiful creations
08:46 right and so you wonder is that a human
08:50 being that went into a swan is it a
08:54 punishment that they're now trying to
08:56 make better I'm gonna feed the fish I'm
08:58 gonna clean up the garden and eventually
09:00 I'll earn my keep back into a human body
09:03 who knows right but the interesting
09:06 thing is is that the maximum ecosystem
09:12 of organized religion is that your soul
09:15 comes out of somewhere God gives it to
09:17 you God makes you out of thin
09:19 like you don't exist and he takes red
09:21 play-doh and some silly putty and a
09:24 paperclip and he MacGyver's you together
09:27 and then sticks you into your mother's
09:29 womb if you're lucky enough to be born
09:33 Planned Parenthood doesn't get old
09:35 you're first you're born and then you
09:37 live and then you die and then the
09:41 traditional Christian religion you go up
09:43 to these pearly gates cos heaven as well
09:46 and you have talked to this dude with
09:48 the big-ass book and he reviews your
09:49 life and if you do well enough you go
09:52 into the pearly gates and if you mess up
09:53 just a little bit when you fire and
09:55 brimstone forever crazy hey right so
10:00 that's the ecosystem of a soul is
10:02 created used once and goes up to heaven
10:05 and stays there forever and God knows
10:07 what you do in heaven for ever all right
10:10 I couldn't give you as a human being a
10:14 definition of heaven that I could
10:17 personally deal with forever you know
10:20 and you know a lot of people just say
10:22 well it's just heaven man it's all
10:24 figured out don't even worry about it
10:25 mm-hmm I'm not worried about it okay I'm
10:28 just thinking about it that's all but
10:31 there's that whole thing of as it is
10:32 above so - it is below maybe that
10:36 applies to a spiritual realm it just
10:39 seems that for things to exist there's
10:41 an ecosystem here on earth if things
10:45 don't have eyeballs and legs regardless
10:48 of their fish or me bethat seem to move
10:51 around a little bit but like a plant
10:55 there's certain folks I think my plants
10:58 are totally alive unconscious completely
11:00 I know they're conscious I mean that's
11:01 been proven but I think they know me and
11:04 I think they know that I love them and I
11:05 think that's why they feel loved and
11:08 this is a giant give and take I sit in
11:11 the bosom of all these beautiful plants
11:13 and they serenade me and I hopefully
11:16 serenade them
11:17 it's a beautiful ecosystem when you get
11:21 around someone that you love especially
11:23 another human being but you're built for
11:25 each other you really are and so you
11:28 harmonize between the two of you and
11:29 magic can happen you look at all the
11:31 great
11:33 teams that have made things science
11:34 teams you know like two people together
11:36 create something great musicians and
11:39 artists and couples and etc etc it's
11:43 magic isn't it we've got plenty of proof
11:46 that that's the case but now here on
11:49 earth what's interesting about it is
11:52 that our soul if you're a Christian and
11:55 I'm not trying to pick on Christianity
11:57 but I just want to give you that example
11:59 it's the religion I know the most about
12:01 it's a one-way trip it just goes born
12:06 die heaven you know if all goes well
12:08 born die hell if you everything goes bad
12:11 or enough goes bad and right so it's
12:14 just one line it's a two-dimensional
12:16 line it's X X Y - X Y maybe Z if you
12:20 think Kevin's up and hell's down all
12:23 right but now what happens to our body
12:26 here on earth ashes to ashes and dust to
12:30 dust we go into the ground and
12:33 eventually we're swallowed up by the
12:35 earth it happens a casket will
12:38 eventually deteriorate your body cells
12:40 will be reincarnated in in the fact that
12:46 it will become another thing think about
12:49 the fact that you know it's potential
12:54 that you contain pieces and parts of
12:59 other things that used to be you eat
13:02 food don't you well if I eat a cow and I
13:06 become strong and I get big muscles
13:10 because I work out then I've got sort of
13:12 like the the pieces and parts of kallen
13:14 me it's just see teeny tiny if I eat a
13:16 bunch of plants with her conscious - and
13:18 I'm becoming part of the plant protein
13:20 okay
13:21 so we see a recycled ecosystem down at
13:25 our level but when it goes to the soul
13:28 it's a one-way trip boom over other
13:32 cultures believe in reincarnation the
13:35 Dalai Lama is a reincarnated soul
13:38 according to their religion every
13:40 religion that endorses karma has to
13:43 believe in reincarnation because that's
13:46 the
13:46 Schmidt be good and what's interesting
13:49 about it reincarnation religions as it
13:53 pertains to your soul and it's sort of
13:55 your scorecard of your soul
13:57 is that you get infinite chances to get
14:01 yourself cleaned up it never ends and
14:03 never ends so you're supposed to hone
14:04 yourself over infinity now it's hard for
14:09 us as human beings to say okay well
14:10 you're gonna be human you know ten
14:13 thousand times and then you're gonna
14:14 reach the sort of like this Buddhist
14:16 enlightenment and then you get to go off
14:18 to another whole realm of existence it's
14:21 still your soul soul is the one thing
14:23 that doesn't need a form it takes form
14:27 it you know maybe it's a symbiotic
14:29 relationship with whatever physical form
14:32 whether you turn into pure light light
14:35 is still a verb of ether winds and so
14:38 you still need to write it with your
14:39 consciousness okay we're so worried
14:44 about the chicken and the egg right
14:46 because we're born and we live when we
14:48 die there's a start and there's a middle
14:50 and there's an end nothing else there's
14:52 just least a start and an end that we're
14:54 concerned about we default to oh people
14:58 like me default a reincarnation because
15:01 you can't hide energy in the world and
15:04 in the universe you can't I couldn't
15:07 hide anything on this patio from the
15:09 universe as far as I know even with the
15:12 most existential mathematical
15:14 multi-dimensional models and I can say
15:15 well I'm gonna push this you know
15:17 microphone stand into another dimension
15:19 of reality in their quantum reality it's
15:21 kind of vibrate out of existence here
15:23 and it goes well it still exists it's
15:25 just in a different universe okay what
15:31 do you care where your soul is as long
15:32 as it's not in some sort of painful
15:34 situation can a soul by itself feel pain
15:37 hmm seems interesting what is the
15:40 definition of pain maybe not maybe we
15:45 feel physical pain all the time but the
15:49 but you know it just depends on how
15:51 severe the physical pain is you know
15:54 I've never lost a limb or been on fire
15:57 and you put my lifetime
15:59 so the idea is the things that hurt me
16:02 the most that I can think of or
16:03 emotional things sometimes it's the
16:06 sweetest thing in the world you're in
16:08 love with somebody and you can't be with
16:10 them right now it doesn't matter you're
16:13 gonna be with them at six o'clock at
16:14 night but you're so just gobsmacked and
16:17 loved you just want to be with them all
16:18 the time you love your child and your
16:21 child's got to be set free to live their
16:24 own life you don't want to be on them
16:25 too much because they have to make their
16:27 own decisions and every time you see me
16:28 just say you love them and you trust
16:29 them if they need anything you're always
16:31 there and you check in on them but you
16:34 know only some kids like their parents
16:36 to be on them 24/7 I'm not one of those
16:38 kids you know I didn't have access to my
16:40 parents and I was a child so I certainly
16:43 don't have a manifestation need for that
16:45 today and I kind of like that that way
16:48 if we share time it's very clean
16:51 but the Swimming's soul summoning soul
16:54 would be sort of all what my friend saw
16:57 he thought that the vision that he saw
17:00 and who knows of his right or wrong
17:01 event meant that we didn't leave earth
17:04 that we just stay here and you didn't
17:08 say that we were trapped you just said
17:09 we don't leave and you know if that's
17:13 the case if Earth is one of those
17:16 celestial creations that is truly
17:18 special in the eyes of God or it is for
17:22 some reason the only thing that we can
17:23 actually attach ourselves to or be
17:25 around perhaps you know perhaps the moon
17:28 is a dead object and there's nothing to
17:30 be on the moon because nothing lives on
17:32 the moon there's no bacteria there's no
17:34 plant life there's no animal life and so
17:37 we can't go there because there's
17:39 nothing I mean we can go but we would
17:41 just be pure soul looking at something
17:43 if we have eyes or some way to sense
17:44 something but because here we have
17:47 actual vessels we can push ourselves
17:48 through the tiniest tiniest little
17:51 insects all the way up to the most
17:53 mammoth creature that's ever walked the
17:55 earth hmm interesting
17:58 an ecosystem doesn't really explain
18:02 where we come from people who take DMT
18:06 they often will tell you that their
18:09 impression of what they see is flying to
18:11 the center of the universe
18:12 meeting God and on the way just seeing
18:17 fun-loving almost dreamlike light
18:21 interpretations of of life you know some
18:25 one person told me it was like seeing
18:27 butterflies made of light and there at
18:32 least in two or more groups to a more in
18:34 a group excuse me and they're flying
18:35 around having a good time well that's
18:38 interesting you ever get the willies
18:41 when you think about you know swimming
18:42 into the deep bowels of the ocean you
18:46 know how whale does it or how some of
18:48 these deep deep diving animals to them
18:51 it's just their realm it's a 3d realm of
18:54 water and you know they go down I don't
18:56 know how far you have to go down before
18:57 you don't have any light but it I would
18:59 imagine it's not as far down as we think
19:01 it is but you wouldn't see any light now
19:03 you're just swimming in blackness so you
19:04 have to have eyeballs that are gonna
19:05 sense things because you can't mean a
19:08 whale could easily just swim right into
19:10 a reef right into a ground right into a
19:13 cliff swim into another whale you know
19:16 obviously they don't go that deep but
19:19 there's fish down on the bottom of the
19:21 ocean just chilling out some fish have
19:24 illuminated bodies how alien and funky
19:28 is that it's just wild man I think
19:31 what's interesting about this question
19:32 of who we are and who made us and what
19:36 made us and how we sustain ourselves is
19:39 it because we can't develop a paradigm
19:42 to even begin to answer the question we
19:45 are left with this void of almost it's
19:51 almost the frustration of someone hope
19:53 withholding an answer that you want
19:54 they've got it and they just won't tell
19:57 you because they're just not gonna tell
20:00 you maybe they're a jerk maybe it's a
20:02 bad piece of information for you to have
20:04 it'll undo your own life it'll make you
20:06 hate your life so yeah it's better you
20:08 don't know it's it's almost like one of
20:10 those things if the old question if you
20:13 had a earth killing meteorite coming at
20:17 us and it's going to hit on a particular
20:19 day they figured the whole thing out and
20:21 they're like game they didn't all The
20:22 Moth mathematical models there's no way
20:24 to avoid it
20:26 and they just say well let's have a
20:29 party with all the money on earth we got
20:33 six months left we're just going to stop
20:35 taxes we're gonna just have a gigantic
20:38 party before it's all over not tell a
20:40 soul
20:41 just let everyone have a good time cuz
20:43 we're all gonna punch out at the same
20:44 time that's probably better rights
20:47 probably better that we go out that way
20:49 that makes you wonder if they ever would
20:51 do that right again I'm not convinced
20:53 that things exist that did fall from
20:55 space that are what we think they are
20:58 because the entire time I've been alive
21:02 we've never had one crater created on
21:06 earth as it appears on the moon as it
21:10 appears in Arizona never not once seems
21:14 kind of weird wouldn't it a hundred
21:16 million
21:17 supposedly rocks from outer space at the
21:20 atmosphere per minute
21:22 another teeny tiny particles and teeny
21:24 tiny rocks we see I've seen plenty of
21:26 shooting stars what they used to call
21:30 falling stars as a tiny digression on
21:33 that you know remember about two years
21:35 ago NASA was saying that some of the
21:37 stars seemed to be disappearing out of
21:39 the sky mmm really I think I even posted
21:43 that up a long time ago on the Facebook
21:46 page because we were seeing the falling
21:50 orbs from space which sometimes look
21:53 really really man-made and sometimes
21:54 don't and David's been filming all these
21:57 stars with these you know plasma bands
22:00 on them and it just it's the most
22:01 bizarre thing it seems like the stars
22:04 are light bulbs up there with just
22:06 plasma zine you know zooming around the
22:08 outside so we're trying to figure out
22:11 who God is all the time at least those
22:14 of us are asked the question and I
22:16 always feel like well you know I write
22:19 mystery when I can if I write a movie I
22:22 write mystery into it and mysteries have
22:25 clues and it's in screenwriting it's
22:28 called cluing and how does it work you
22:30 know you find a little tidbit of
22:32 something and then it leads to the next
22:34 clue the next clue the next crew until
22:35 you find out what's really going on and
22:37 then you
22:38 have the main character deal with it and
22:42 conquer his or her obstacle thus
22:45 creating a comedy which is not funny it
22:50 just means that they overcame their
22:51 obstacle okay so we're down here on
22:57 earth we only have certain sets of
23:00 information certain faculty to discern
23:02 that information we have to be
23:04 enlightened we have to enlighten each
23:05 other so we can see more and then
23:09 hopefully we're pulling it we find that
23:11 little thread that's sticking out of the
23:13 sweater and we pull it enough that we
23:15 finally find out what's going on now
23:18 there's a lot of you along with me we
23:21 all believe that everything we've ever
23:22 wanted to know about the universe is
23:24 here it's not here as an object on the
23:27 patio with me it is accessible once you
23:31 focus your mind and again like I've said
23:33 in several episodes you have to write
23:35 the database query to get the
23:37 information back to you what's
23:40 fascinating for me is that so many
23:45 things that I have researched and then
23:48 just sat around that and thought about
23:49 and then wrote down most of them now are
23:53 just episodes I'm now finding ether
23:57 Athiya Rees all over the place where
24:00 when I said it I felt crazy and now
24:03 there's like articles written about it
24:04 and it's like wow you know I just did a
24:08 episode on Coral Castle which probably
24:12 will have aired before this episode in
24:14 season five and I'm talking about how
24:16 it's all a thorough base II throw based
24:18 and then I found another article about
24:21 the the magnetic wheel thing that he
24:24 created and it's all ether based in the
24:29 article and I'm sitting there going you
24:32 know unbelievable everyone's having the
24:34 same epiphany now no one has talked
24:36 about the quantum locking that I talked
24:37 about to move the blocks that I know of
24:39 but it's interesting there were all sort
24:43 of delving into the same pool of
24:46 information as philip k dick called it
24:48 the river of knowledge
24:50 it's around you constantly what imagine
24:53 my friends river of souls
24:55 well souls would have tremendous amounts
24:58 of access to the universe right because
25:01 it is what I believe to be the sort of
25:05 quantum force of consciousness quantum
25:08 just simply meaning a unit a unit of
25:11 soul is what you are a unit of souls
25:13 what I am we are all connected we are I
25:19 really believe that our souls are it's
25:22 sort of like okay I'll give you I'll
25:24 give you a perfect example an analogy of
25:26 how I think our souls might be working I
25:29 have some lights
25:32 I don't ever turn them on but they're
25:35 their little round two-inch light bulbs
25:38 put them up during your Christmas one
25:40 time but think about Christmas lights on
25:41 a Christmas tree okay
25:44 so they're cute little light bulbs look
25:47 you know they're molded to look like
25:48 little tiny candles and how does it work
25:51 they're all pinched into a big line of a
25:53 voltage you plug them into the wall and
25:57 it screams down the wire in lights of
26:00 every individual light bulb okay so we
26:04 have one source of energy from the wall
26:07 but if you really think about it they
26:10 distinctly represent themselves as bulbs
26:12 and one could in their you know you had
26:15 a bunch of colored light bulbs you could
26:17 see this little red guy he's got a
26:18 little personality and there's a little
26:20 blue one he has his own little
26:21 personality but underneath the bulb is
26:25 the stream of electricity that's
26:27 enabling them to exist it crawls up a
26:30 little wire boils a little filament it
26:33 comes back down it doesn't boil but you
26:36 know what I'm saying the friction makes
26:37 it light up amazing you can touch it
26:41 with your finger but if you were to
26:42 touch the filament inside you'd burn
26:44 yourself third-degree is about a
26:46 thousand degrees as I'm told
26:49 could that simple simple analogy that
26:52 simple example be how all the souls in
26:54 the universe work it's just a just like
26:59 ether which is kind of a big bowl of
27:02 water
27:03 that holds the universe together it is
27:05 the universe it is the universe you know
27:08 I always wondered why the Sun made me
27:11 feel so good and you know how in the
27:15 summertime like it is right now it's
27:18 very you tend to be more positive in the
27:20 summertime now some people love winter
27:23 I'm not saying that winter isn't
27:25 beautiful if you live in a certain
27:26 places but in California it doesn't snow
27:28 here so just gets cold and we think
27:31 about what it was like when it was warm
27:32 and we got a beach she really can't do
27:34 much on because it's cold you know the
27:36 the ocean gets down to really freezing
27:40 temperatures you know not freezing
27:42 freezing but you wouldn't want to put
27:43 your feet in it for more than a few
27:44 minutes so when I realized that I think
27:49 were made out of ether being in the Sun
27:51 is like imperative you know your
27:56 pituitary gland they that exudes vitamin
28:01 D to keep you healthy very important
28:04 people sit inside too much get sick more
28:07 often that's why when we see people with
28:10 tan skin the genetics of a man / mankind
28:14 right we think they're more healthy
28:17 we're attracted to them more now of
28:21 course there's places in the world where
28:24 the women never ever get any Sun and
28:25 that's what they're it's part of their
28:28 culture
28:28 okay maybe their genetics or more
28:31 reinforced maybe they have a more
28:33 natural flow of vitamin D without any
28:35 Sun perhaps like I said go look up
28:39 Russian kids being toured through
28:43 tanning rooms to keep them healthy yeah
28:48 I felt this is one little picture bunch
28:50 of little kids and their undies don't
28:52 get excited Podesta and they have their
28:54 little you know painting goggles on and
28:58 they're all just sitting there and
28:59 staying in their row proud you know the
29:01 article said something like they get
29:02 exposed to 15 minutes of this thing once
29:05 a day to keep them healthy it was cute
29:08 it was like oh wow they really figured
29:10 out you do need Sun we moved out of the
29:12 equator where we were conceived most
29:14 likely up to these northern hemisphere
29:17 regions where man was not necessarily
29:19 designed to exist and we had to
29:21 mechanically compensate for what we're
29:23 losing okay so let's keep the analogies
29:26 flowing here swimming Souls if something
29:30 Souls is nothing more than a bad choice
29:34 of words for me to talk about the
29:36 ecosystem of souls well let's think
29:38 about ether all ecosystems and our just
29:42 our solar system the Sun is a plasma
29:45 ball his ether that is slowed down
29:48 enough to be seen let's just say but not
29:53 slow enough to turn into anything that
29:54 we designate as an element or an atomic
29:57 property a quark of any kind it is still
29:59 moving too quickly and it has a this
30:04 plume this 3d plume that comes out of
30:06 the Sun it comes out of the earth comes
30:08 out of the moon anything that's a
30:10 celestial body in space will have this
30:12 and we call them the Van Allen belts
30:14 around Earth right well think about if
30:17 you were to either a particle trying to
30:18 at a consciousness you're trying to make
30:20 out what you are but your birthing point
30:22 somewhere on the outside of the Sun and
30:26 it's a big belt and you're really way
30:28 out there in the solar system well
30:30 because of the way everything bumps into
30:32 itself and creates a gravity field
30:37 the gravity push of ether you're going
30:41 to go back into the bowels of the Sun at
30:43 some time now what if it's not ether
30:48 it's souls okay so what would be the big
30:53 thing we'd be going back into at some
30:55 point in our journey
30:57 it could be God it could be the greatest
31:00 concentration of what it is that makes
31:03 us up okay think about this way I think
31:08 it's fairly safe to say that if an
31:10 either particle heliocentric model is
31:13 coming out of the Sun and happens to hit
31:15 earth at the right angle it actually
31:19 gets into Earth orbit and starts going
31:21 inside the earth and maybe it sticks
31:23 inside the bowels of the earth and
31:25 inflates it for expanding earth or maybe
31:27 it just keeps it just joins a vanilla
31:30 belt cycle
31:32 so then you would change entire
31:35 universes sort of in your mind as I was
31:37 a son particle now I'm an earth particle
31:40 but later on I'm a moon particle if this
31:43 place gets obliterated by something
31:45 something resets everything then your
31:48 whatever and wherever that is let's say
31:51 the sea we really are in a spiral galaxy
31:53 let's see the Milky Way is really that
31:55 John not convinced okay then we just
31:59 keep shifting moving around it's
32:01 infinite but then we have this issue of
32:06 things observed seem to change now for
32:12 those of you who cut my episode on you
32:16 know the whole thing about why people
32:18 see us stare feuless staring at them a
32:22 human being existing in a room changes
32:25 the entire and Tomic property of the
32:27 room it does because I'll have a lot
32:30 more is happening than it's being
32:31 registered especially on an ether level
32:33 if I move my hand up you know I'm
32:36 changing everything not only just the
32:38 light reflection off my hand but all the
32:40 ether particles that are making up my
32:42 hand are splashing everywhere it's the
32:45 whole biophoton episode I did so we
32:48 think that physics changes when human
32:49 beings observe things well our eyeballs
32:52 I think our giant projectile you know
32:55 laser beams of ether it's a concave
33:00 divot in my skull which is catching all
33:03 the ether and bouncing it straight out
33:04 so wherever I'm looking I'm projecting
33:06 more and more ether at that thing so if
33:09 I'm observing a laser I could change the
33:11 lasers behavior simply because I'm
33:13 existing okay so I think the second
33:18 logical question along the lines of what
33:20 we're talking about here is that we want
33:24 to believe that inanimate matter such as
33:27 like ether it is merely constrained by
33:31 its collisions and that you know atoms
33:35 exist because of 3d space particles
33:40 dense enough to be present in generally
33:44 most
33:45 places that we would exist right I still
33:48 think that in a certain you know
33:51 microscopic level we start seeing giant
33:55 calves
33:55 you know chasms between II throw
33:56 particles but we just cut that out
33:59 because we're not trying to look down
34:00 beyond existence on that level we go up
34:03 to the quantum level of a ether particle
34:05 and then we're seeing all reality we're
34:08 seeing just a whole like just like blood
34:09 going through an artery just boom boom
34:11 boom you see them collide all the time
34:13 what's going on in the river is going on
34:16 inside your inside your arteries the
34:19 tree branches look like your lung
34:21 arteries you know I mean it's it's all
34:22 the same thing and it's all the same
34:24 forces and it does not drastically
34:26 change simply because you give it a
34:29 different name but we what we probably
34:33 want to believe maybe it's the case
34:37 because there's this other word that
34:39 gets into the soul problem the soul
34:42 equation the soul question let's say you
34:46 bought some of the stuff I just told you
34:47 about an ecosystem of souls we still
34:51 want to believe and I'm not going to
34:54 disappoint here we want to believe that
34:56 there's a mechanism a logical paradigm
34:59 of mechanism to create things creation
35:03 we create things here on earth I'm
35:06 creating this episode right now I am
35:07 shaping lights I'm shaping sound and
35:10 then have low nian Li in your minds as
35:13 you hear my voice it is shaping the way
35:15 you feel
35:16 perhaps you're getting tired you know so
35:20 we want to believe that the soul layer
35:23 of our existence the consciousness layer
35:26 which is really probably all souls are
35:28 as the consciousness of the universe
35:32 that we irrespective of ether old
35:36 dictation we do control what we are when
35:42 we are how we are
35:43 etc etc now it's interesting about being
35:47 born into any one vessel where you you
35:51 essentially surrender the freedom of
35:54 being consciousness out there in the
35:56 universe right maybe in consciousness
35:58 and
35:58 universe we can be a bunch of different
36:00 things we're just in a constant dream
36:03 state for all we know now what you would
36:05 dream of would be very interesting if
36:07 you were puresole because you're not in
36:08 a body anymore do you still dream of
36:10 being human dude do your dream of
36:11 something else again I had a dream where
36:14 I woke up in the dream and I was a tree
36:16 and it was just trees there was this
36:20 green mist towards the bottom and the
36:23 other trees told me I woke up and I said
36:25 oh my god
36:25 I'm actually a tree and the other tree
36:29 said yeah we're all trees I said what
36:31 was I dreaming of and they said you're
36:34 dreaming of not being a tree I was like
36:37 wow and it was sort of this insinuation
36:40 this rhetorical sinuous
36:42 insinuation from the other trees that we
36:44 don't have arms and legs and we can't
36:46 walk around and we are stuck here for an
36:49 eternity so of course we dream of being
36:51 human what else would we do just be a
36:54 tree and it's interesting because I had
36:57 eyes I had I didn't have my balls
36:59 necessarily but I was I was a tree trunk
37:01 looking down on myself and I was looking
37:02 around and it was just a perfectly
37:04 planted landscape of trees it actually
37:08 went down from where I was and there was
37:10 oil and there was other trees there's no
37:13 buildings there's no civilization
37:16 outside of trees was interesting but
37:19 don't we want to believe that we can
37:21 craft things and I think that once we
37:24 surrender ourselves to a particular body
37:26 of any life we then have to adopt its
37:30 paradigm potential which is to say if
37:34 you're a plant can you dream of being a
37:37 name would be if you can't walk can you
37:40 dream of walking
37:41 could you make yourself walk I mean if
37:43 any of you've seen time-lapse
37:44 photography of plants you know reaching
37:48 out to water reaching out the Sun it's
37:50 it seems very conscious I mean you man
37:53 people can say it's all mechanical
37:54 because you know it's getting Sun on one
37:57 side so the photosynthesis is working
38:00 and so that part of the plant grows more
38:02 in that direction and maybe that's true
38:04 not sure I just want to take a break
38:07 here and say
38:09 I've been recording on my patio now for
38:11 four years and doctor at night several
38:16 times and in the last two months this
38:19 backyard is alive I mean the amount of
38:22 animals I have jumping around it is off
38:26 the chain I can't even see them just
38:28 behind the camera there one of the
38:29 branches it's at least eight feet off
38:31 the ground just started shaking like
38:33 crazy because there's something up there
38:34 two animals are fighting back there in
38:36 the in the bush I got one crawling over
38:38 here possums raccoons little tiny rats
38:42 rats love palm seeds it's interesting I
38:47 think we tend to believe that we can't
38:49 be certain things because as human
38:53 beings we can definitely conceive of
38:55 being different things and we can't find
38:57 a way to make it happen you know lots of
39:00 human beings
39:01 almost all modern Western world human
39:04 beings have conceived of flying just
39:07 doing it because just like Superman all
39:11 right
39:11 I have not seen human being fly in my
39:13 lifetime I don't think it's a matter of
39:16 just believing that you could fly
39:17 because we'd have some crazy people I
39:19 mean the feral homeless of the world
39:22 that are you know losing their mind
39:24 because they're malnutritioned you think
39:27 they start flying because they can't
39:28 conceive of what they can't do I mean
39:30 it's just they're kind of out there in
39:31 their strange realms sane asylums would
39:34 be full of all kinds of super humans
39:36 because they would believe they could do
39:38 a lot of things that they can't do but I
39:41 do think that there's a margin of things
39:43 that were yet to discover as human
39:44 beings that is definitely within our
39:47 spectrum I don't know if we need to
39:49 actually modify our proteins and our
39:52 brain patterns to pull it off I don't
39:54 know I guess the biggest question is do
39:57 we need to and maybe if we contributed
40:01 to the overall design of the universe
40:04 through being this consciousness force
40:07 that's perfectly blended in and
40:10 coexisting with ether then everything
40:14 that we've created is either a logical
40:15 shape like a round planet which is what
40:19 ether would do create everything to be
40:21 round and
40:22 just you know a small round thing would
40:23 be called a rock and a big round thing
40:26 might be called a planet and a super big
40:27 round thing that's on fire because it it
40:30 constantly combust due to just sheer
40:33 impact because it's so large it may be a
40:38 Sun aka star don't know haven't you
40:44 experienced either directly or
40:48 indirectly someone who believed in their
40:51 dream and they went for their dream and
40:55 they got it through every trial and
41:00 tribulation they got it because when
41:03 they failed they just picked themselves
41:05 back up and kept going and then you've
41:08 seen folks and we've all done this too
41:09 we've had dreams where we gave it up we
41:13 were too young to know that we should
41:14 have kept going
41:15 we didn't prioritize it in our life
41:18 something other some other fun that
41:21 short-term thing was happening and so we
41:23 gave up the long-term goal for the
41:25 short-term goal later regretted it and
41:28 that might be one of the very basis
41:32 consciousness decisions / mechanism /
41:36 limitations or enable errs for us to get
41:39 what we want but now imagine let's say
41:44 that within the human vessel there are X
41:49 number of things we haven't accomplished
41:51 yet because we believe a paradigm that
41:53 we can't even though the designers of
41:57 the human body the Homo sapiens sapiens
42:00 species fully embedded in the human
42:04 species these other things that we
42:06 haven't done yet maybe telekinetics we
42:09 can move things with our mind maybe
42:12 communicating without words ESP seeing
42:18 ghosts whatever it is all these
42:19 different things seeing different
42:20 frequencies okay but now what if you pop
42:26 out of your body and you join the
42:27 architects of the universe you've always
42:30 been one of these these slices of
42:33 consciousness because the universe
42:36 if it is truly electricity that's
42:38 lighting up individual bulbs in a string
42:40 of Christmas lights you are everything
42:43 as well as maybe for a moment a bulb
42:46 your the whole power source and you're
42:49 the bulb as I said in the staring
42:52 episode ether might be providing for
42:56 this realm of existence the medium by
42:59 which it's it's really the barrel of the
43:01 gun and your soul is the bullet as you
43:05 shoot out you're carrying the form that
43:09 is the bullet what you are and you fly
43:12 out and you can land in another location
43:13 and you have brought your information of
43:16 what you are your form your being
43:17 everything you've learned to the other
43:20 location and if its splashes and
43:24 influences via frequencies for any
43:26 frequencies tend to influence other
43:28 frequencies you know it's the old night
43:32 at the Roxbury SNL skit where Chris
43:37 Kattan and Will Ferrell are banging back
43:39 and forth dancing and then someone gets
43:41 between them and they start shaking them
43:42 and they are now dancing into the same
43:45 exact rhythm as these two guys maybe
43:47 it's on a backbeat where they're getting
43:49 beat up but that's what happens all
43:53 these mechanics that have tried to and
43:57 it's successfully controlled the mines
44:01 machines that control your mind you know
44:04 they put the little cylinder inside of a
44:06 on a little circuit inside of a bull's
44:10 brain right on top of the bull's brain
44:12 and so the bowl comes charging at you
44:14 and they pop it and the bull can't think
44:16 anymore and it starts to kind of you
44:18 know it's really just going through
44:19 convulsions as the brain has been
44:20 overloaded it's a very crude example but
44:24 that has been that exact technique was
44:26 modified over probably half a century
44:28 maybe even seven years at this point and
44:32 that's how they know they can being a
44:33 frequency at your brain and you're gonna
44:35 have an obtuse set of emotions you're
44:38 gonna feel afraid you're gonna feel
44:39 comforted whatever in love mad whatever
44:43 they can do it to you the the mapping of
44:47 the brain that's gone on now where
44:49 people can
44:49 now dictate words just by thinking about
44:53 them and so they one of the POW most
44:57 powerful dictation technologies they're
44:59 trying to pioneer at this point is when
45:03 you think of a word there's a lot of
45:05 subconscious patterns inside your brain
45:07 electrical patterns and a very three
45:09 dimensional array in your brain start to
45:11 conceive of the word and then you start
45:13 to conceive of saying the word but as an
45:15 image of the word in your mind and they
45:17 have through very mechanical brute-force
45:21 techniques probably big machine learning
45:23 as well have figured out this
45:25 configuration the brain happens when you
45:27 want to say the word watermelon this
45:29 happens when you want to say the word
45:30 dolphin and so it writes it into the
45:34 computer and you think that thing's
45:35 reading your mind and it sort of is it's
45:38 not doing it in any spiritual way it's
45:41 doing it in a very mechanical way all
45:44 right
45:45 the other thing I always ask myself is
45:50 if you met a human being who was
45:53 immortal and they had lived a thousand
45:55 years and you have a conversation with
45:57 them about your life your trials and
46:00 tribulations of life and they're looking
46:02 at you having lived God knows how many
46:04 lives it would be minimum of 10 lives
46:07 right because they would have lived a
46:09 hundred years 10 times and that would
46:11 get you to a thousand but let's just say
46:13 they lived the average sigh maybe they
46:14 lived fifteen lives and they've been
46:17 married and divorced and they've had
46:19 kids and they've had no kids they've
46:20 been a woman they've been a man if well
46:23 sorry that wouldn't be a woman man but
46:26 they have that maybe who knows but they
46:30 didn't actually reincarnate but you know
46:32 that conversation would be very
46:34 interesting because their wisdom would
46:37 be powerful
46:39 SuperDuper proper if they remembered the
46:41 10th there were 1000 years that they
46:43 lived but not take that up to 10,000
46:46 what kind of person would be you know
46:50 what would a person sound like who has
46:53 lived 10,000 years wouldn't it be
46:56 amazing to have that conversation I mean
46:58 maybe it'd be the driest conversation
47:00 you've ever had in your life
47:01 but
47:02 about taking someone's advice right if
47:06 you go see a psychiatrist and talk out
47:08 things with the psychiatrist well you
47:10 know you're looking at immortal human
47:11 being who's gonna have no more years of
47:14 life than you provide you both take care
47:16 of your bodies and you have good
47:17 genetics they just have focused their
47:21 minds on studying the human condition
47:23 they've listened to hopefully hundreds
47:25 if not thousands of patients before you
47:27 brought in your issues see you tend to
47:30 trust them because they've seen these
47:33 patterns over and over and over again so
47:35 what would be the pattern recognition of
47:37 someone a thousand years old and ten
47:39 thousand years old
47:41 the reason why I mention that is that
47:43 think about the lifecycle of a soul what
47:46 do they care about what do we care about
47:50 once we leave the human vessel are we
47:53 terribly concerned with pain and
47:55 suffering and death I don't know I tend
47:59 to think as much as it pains in my heart
48:02 in one perspective they don't because
48:05 they're like don't worry about it you're
48:08 gonna be reborn doesn't matter if you
48:10 die it one month old or a hundred and
48:13 ten or 200 years old you're gonna live
48:16 again because you can't stop and if
48:20 their pure form of existence our pure
48:23 form of existence as a pure soul is
48:27 painless wonderful you just you're yours
48:31 it's almost like being in the best toy
48:33 store in the universe
48:34 you can play with toys and be
48:36 entertained you can create toys if you
48:38 get bored you can take two toys and push
48:41 them together and then there's the big
48:44 giant question of what matters when
48:46 you're a pure form I've really been
48:51 thinking about people's you know
48:53 near-death experiences where they they
48:57 died technically their body died they
49:01 floated away from their bodies they had
49:02 these experiences every single one of
49:05 them have said it's painless it's
49:07 wonderful all those little aches and
49:10 pains you had in your body that you just
49:12 grew to you know tolerate gone
49:16 and then when they come back to their
49:18 bodies because something traumatic
49:19 happened to them that made them die
49:22 they're back in their body and they're
49:24 kind of grumpy because they're like oh
49:26 God I got to wake up in this thing if
49:28 someone got in a major accident they
49:29 might wake up in a tremendous amount of
49:31 physical pain having just recently
49:33 touched that other realm of no pain may
49:38 be a feeling of all knowledge but by the
49:41 time you get back to the body just like
49:42 a dream that floats away because you're
49:43 not supposed to have that information
49:45 when you're in your body it's designed
49:47 not to be able to hold the answer to the
49:50 universe life the universe and
49:52 everything which is only 42 so I don't
49:55 know what the problem is what I have
49:58 found and you know what you have to
50:00 understand like before I started this
50:04 show I don't think I'd put much thought
50:07 into reincarnation at all it was through
50:10 doing the shows and doing episodes that
50:12 I was like oh yeah we do I just feel
50:16 like we do we absolutely reincarnate
50:19 what that means and where we go and what
50:22 we turn into I don't think it's
50:24 exclusively human at all maybe it is but
50:28 then how does a dog get a soul how do
50:30 some animals just act human it's
50:33 interesting I swear to God I have I have
50:37 spiders little house spiders little
50:39 jumping spiders right when they're teeny
50:41 tiny and that one guy has the 3d jumping
50:44 spider as his main character on YouTube
50:48 but guys make gobs of money off this
50:49 thing they do they you know in their in
50:53 your they usually hang up my sink in my
50:55 bathroom or whatever it's like once
50:57 every six months and they turn around
50:59 look at you you know and if you reach
51:02 over for the soap they turn to watch
51:04 your hand grab the soap and then turn
51:05 around and if you kind of come close to
51:07 them just like that animated character
51:09 on YouTube there just hop away from me
51:10 like I don't know Nurmi I got this
51:12 instinct I think you're gonna kill me
51:13 you're bigger than me and I just got
51:15 born and I'm not taking any chances on
51:18 my life I want to live and isn't it
51:20 interesting that all things want to live
51:22 isn't it interesting how many times you
51:24 try to swat a fly you just goes oh sure
51:26 no problem I'll sit right here while you
51:28 whack me with that thing
51:30 nope even if you get them they're trying
51:33 to live spiders they're hilarious man
51:36 you touch a spider I mean other than
51:37 like black widows that are like I will
51:38 [ __ ] you up right they come right at you
51:41 but they're coming at you because they
51:43 want to fight and get rid of you you
51:44 know I had this story right where I'm
51:46 sitting yeah when I first moved here
51:48 sixteen years ago at how bachi grilled
51:51 that I it was the only thing I could
51:52 happened my apartment complex before I
51:54 moved here and I left it out here for a
51:57 few months and a black widow got up in
52:00 there Big Mama probably easily two and a
52:04 half inches across if I were to flatten
52:06 her out she probably damn near three
52:08 inches big big old red spot on her back
52:10 and I open this thing up because I was
52:13 gonna use it for the first time and
52:14 there she is and so I was like okay I
52:18 need to use this like I guess coming
52:20 over I'm gonna do this thing it's like
52:22 walked out in the center of that yard
52:24 but back there behind me and I shook her
52:25 album this chick came after me with a
52:30 vengeance
52:30 I turned and and she bought me she bit
52:34 me she would have left the mark and
52:35 probably made me sick cry she was so
52:37 huge but no matter where I went in the
52:39 yard she would follow me and I had a
52:41 killer cuz it was like she was gonna be
52:44 a big nuisance on the patio she was like
52:45 I had a great place and you just screwed
52:48 it up you jerk right it's interesting I
52:52 mean well you know scientists will just
52:54 say well that's their genetic
52:55 programming it's like well maybe maybe
52:59 they're fully conscious just like human
53:03 beings they're not having the same exact
53:04 internet questions that we are having
53:06 but they have their own little ecosystem
53:08 their own world and they want to live
53:11 animals that are freaked out about us
53:13 you know you go to rhesus monkey got a
53:15 big sandwich and you're in they'll run
53:16 away for a little while until they
53:17 realize I could probably steal that out
53:19 of his hand then they grabbed a whole
53:21 Cheetos bag and take off frame something
53:24 very powerful and very evident is going
53:27 on and I think man is so [ __ ] so
53:34 slow and is thinking that we can't hold
53:38 enough information in our mind at one
53:40 time to have a heightened thought
53:43 higher thought to think that all these
53:46 people like Elon Musk and reycarts well
53:48 god bless him they think they're going
53:51 to digitize the human brain into a
53:53 computer and it's immediately going to
53:55 start living and breathing in a computer
53:57 you have to understand we are thousands
54:01 of years from that ever even remotely
54:03 occurring as a simulation of mankind
54:07 just being able to digitize every
54:10 electron in the brain and its physical
54:12 structure its cellular structure and all
54:14 of its nuances of synapse versus normal
54:17 you know suitcase mitosis cells and
54:20 we're so far away from that it's
54:22 ridiculous and for them to tout that
54:23 over and over again is ridiculous Elon
54:26 Musk twenty twenty boys gonna digitize
54:29 the brain twenty eighteen he was gonna
54:31 walk on Mars I mean how many times this
54:33 guy gonna pull crap out of his ass and
54:35 we're you know gonna let it go it's
54:38 ridiculous the soul exists it does and
54:44 because it exists the only thing man's
54:48 gonna be able to do is create some form
54:50 of artificial life and maybe trick the
54:53 universe and giving it a soul and then
54:56 find a way to mechanically trap it you
54:59 know a Frankenstein formula I don't
55:03 think it'll ever happen I don't think
55:04 souls have a containment field you know
55:08 and I once heard a I think I mentioned
55:11 this one time in an alien episode there
55:14 was a guy in Britain who thought he's
55:20 the guy that sit at a podium and talk
55:22 like an alien and it was the funniest
55:24 thing you'd ever seen your life it's
55:26 it's a cringe video on like level 11
55:30 okay I know what you look up alien
55:33 presentation guy talks like alien or
55:35 something like that I don't know but in
55:37 his presentation he had this interesting
55:40 other theory which was have how many of
55:44 you have seen the world
55:46 drawn in a logo and there's a grid
55:49 around the earth like a line grid around
55:54 the earth
55:55 he put that up on his overhead and he
55:57 said that that it was the alien race I
56:00 think he said an alien race that had
56:03 figured out how to trap all the souls on
56:05 earth and that what we were supposed to
56:08 be able to do is die and leave Earth but
56:11 this forcefield they put around earth is
56:13 holding us in and so we ascend to God
56:16 bounce off the shield and come back down
56:20 and get reborn again as if you're
56:24 supposed to have a one-way ticket god
56:26 only lets you ride the roller coaster
56:27 once and then I guess at some point
56:31 everyone's ridden the roller coaster and
56:32 then it gets torn down I don't know
56:33 sounds weird to me there's another weird
56:36 assertion that I just haven't been able
56:38 to shake it's it's amazing how utterly
56:42 creative people are with their pursuits
56:46 of truth or the pursuits of making money
56:48 through these weird presentations I mean
56:50 it blows my mind that there's so many
56:54 uninteresting people doing presentations
56:57 on podiums to these big organizations
56:59 really no one's getting enlightened much
57:02 you know maybe they get a history lesson
57:03 David Icke is very entertaining I will
57:06 say that dude stitches things together
57:09 better than anyone I have ever seen ever
57:11 and I've seen some pretty good pretty
57:14 good connection episodes on the Internet
57:16 where people are doing that at a podium
57:19 sometimes it's a personal experience and
57:21 there's no one else you can get the
57:22 information from I met an alien let me
57:25 tell you what his lipo boom boom ring
57:27 the other one I want to stress with you
57:30 guys because I think it will lead to a
57:35 much more enlightened version of
57:37 yourself because I get I get comments on
57:41 YouTube and I appreciate virtually all
57:44 of them except for a couple people they
57:46 get a little cranky which we haven't had
57:48 for years and they will do what I call
57:54 the nut shell Theory they're commenting
57:56 on something very deep it's in an
57:59 episode but they they'll say well I just
58:01 think it's this it's just that just that
58:03 simple now they could be right I think
58:07 what's
58:08 tough reading that sort of common is
58:10 that they don't like it would be better
58:14 for me to read a comment that's got a
58:15 simple epiphany at the end slash
58:18 solution to a dilemma we're trying to
58:21 parse and the person says well I was
58:24 with you initially you know twenty years
58:28 before your show existed I thought that
58:30 too
58:31 and then I went down this path and I
58:32 connected this connected that and you
58:34 show a lineage of your thoughts going
58:36 from perhaps where I am today
58:39 to this other super epiphany and the
58:42 reasons why you made your decisions up
58:43 and down left and right positive
58:45 negative you know one thing's true one
58:47 thing's false and that way we get to see
58:50 your train of thoughts and that's much
58:52 more persuasive to me than someone
58:54 saying well it's just we're on the back
58:57 of a turtle boom that's it another one I
59:00 have seen four G's for as long as the
59:02 Internet chatting has ever existed and
59:04 for as long as texting as existed on
59:07 cell phones people will you'll say
59:15 something and that you're having a
59:17 conversation with someone and you will
59:22 articulate something as like you really
59:26 spend some time on your text you're
59:28 really trying to explain a concept it's
59:30 not even that deep it's not deep it's it
59:31 could be something like they're asking
59:33 you like what do you would you do today
59:34 how's your day and then you carefully
59:37 explain a list of things or then they
59:39 ask you one follow-up question and you
59:41 you elaborate on it and then within
59:44 seconds you get this what and then you
59:49 sit there and you think oh wait a minute
59:50 if we were talking live and I say
59:54 something and your mind drifts for a
59:55 second and you don't get what I'm saying
59:57 and then you're like I'm sorry I just
59:59 sorry I was just think of something else
60:00 what you say again it's not about this
60:03 right totally get a live situation but
60:07 when you have a transcript of the
60:09 conversation it blows my mind how people
60:12 will come back to a transcribed
60:14 conversation which you just scroll your
60:17 finger down and you can read the
60:19 previous parts of the conversation
60:21 saying what with the question mark is
60:25 almost an unforgivable faux pas of
60:32 communicating with someone else you owe
60:35 them the respect to at least go back to
60:41 the previous paragraph and read through
60:43 it and where you're getting confused you
60:46 say what are you talking about with the
60:49 the watermelon and the dolphin again I
60:51 don't get it and then at least it's like
60:53 okay sorry I should have clarified
60:55 should have made this easier but just
60:57 saying would I get this all the time and
61:00 I will tell you it is very very
61:03 difficult for me it doesn't happen a lot
61:05 unfortunately ladies it only happens
61:07 with you guys I lose a tremendous amount
61:11 of respect for that human being almost
61:13 permanently because I'm thinking i mean
61:16 i-i divvy my time up and i police my
61:21 time extremely carefully okay so if I'm
61:24 having a conversation with you
61:26 it's because I have cut that time out of
61:28 my life I'm not gonna be creative I'm
61:30 not gonna be pushing something forward
61:31 in my life I'm gonna stop and have this
61:34 information exchange and I'm gonna be
61:36 using the slowest means possible which
61:38 is me typing or she on my phone phone
61:41 typing is just the worst invention on
61:43 planet Earth period okay so when someone
61:47 isn't going to put the intellectual
61:48 minimums in to actually invest in the
61:51 conversation and know what I'm saying
61:54 it's a pet peeve of mine I hate it and
61:56 I'll just start not talking that person
61:59 anymore because when I talk to them
62:00 they're not paying attention can't be
62:02 burdened to [ __ ] read what I say poof
62:05 you're gone because I just doesn't mean
62:08 if I have to talk to one of you listener
62:09 Senate that has anything to do with that
62:11 I'm just really busy it's reason why I
62:14 mentioned that little digression is that
62:17 when we talk about these sorts of
62:18 subjects work I think very few people
62:20 have talked about it you know now deep
62:22 inside fills philosophers they
62:26 definitely have they spent decades doing
62:28 it you know there's certain specialized
62:32 classes and colleges that he talked
62:34 about it
62:34 I'm not in those places so unfortunately
62:36 I got a rift by myself and with you guys
62:39 but what's beautiful is that you know
62:43 for those of you who are just joining
62:44 the show we have some of the most
62:47 brilliant minds and I am not
62:51 exaggerating I'm not blowing smoke in
62:53 the youtubes in the comments on the
62:57 YouTube videos and on our Facebook
62:59 channel that's locked on Facebook just
63:01 some great usually a little deeper on
63:03 YouTube because we're having a blast on
63:05 Facebook we just have a good time on
63:07 Facebook it's really fun it's just a
63:09 positive place to be because I'm a
63:11 member of one of my buddies conspiracy
63:13 pages and that thing's just like you
63:16 know it's like ulcer medicine
63:18 it's decreed ulcers not to solve them
63:21 right and I guess let me digress for a
63:26 split second here I got a few more and
63:28 half an inch on this thing I have
63:31 friends that digest heavy-duty negative
63:35 conspiracies all day long and I will
63:39 tell you that they are miserable people
63:42 not miserable to be with but they in
63:45 themselves they just don't understand
63:47 why they're so negative and they start
63:49 to just their energy starts to go down
63:51 it's like I was there I was there in
63:54 2005 and probably to 2010 creating him
63:59 killed to radio really got me feeling
64:01 much much better as the world repaired
64:03 itself you know this last two years has
64:06 been tremendous if you're aware of
64:07 what's going on in the world so that's
64:11 why I create deep thoughts radio and I
64:13 try to stay away from things that are
64:15 going to give you that emotion every
64:17 once in a while we have to nut up and
64:19 and put some skin in the game which is
64:21 why create some of those episodes I'm
64:23 gonna do an episode on crisis actors
64:25 this year not something I want to do
64:27 it's going to get shadow band like crazy
64:29 I don't know how to title it any other
64:33 way because I to do it justice it has to
64:37 have that name it does so let me know
64:40 what you think maybe give it some
64:44 thought because a new idea
64:46 maybe play this episode twice you know
64:49 you've heard the concepts now go back
64:51 and read listen to it and put your own
64:53 ideas down sift through it for a little
64:55 while
64:56 what indications do you have that we
64:58 have a soul or don't have a soul if you
65:02 don't believe in reincarnation then
65:03 please explain to me the one-way trip
65:06 and how you're gonna live forever in any
65:08 state of being and be satisfied and try
65:12 not to just say well just heaven man for
65:15 God to create a place where you could be
65:17 forever and not be eventually in the
65:20 Buddhist definition of heaven which is
65:21 Nirvana which is hell it would be the
65:25 greatest accomplishment of any Supreme
65:27 Being to create an environment like that
65:29 that's what I believe be the toughest
65:32 thing to ever do ever and you know no I
65:37 want to ride the roller coaster again
65:39 don't you be a different person I think
65:42 it'd be great I think I've done it
65:44 several times maybe I've done it
65:45 infinitely knows you too what is it to
65:50 have been reincarnated almost infinite
65:52 times or infinite times and you don't
65:54 know that it happened how where does
65:57 that one right and then again if you did
66:00 remember would you become a queue at a
66:03 Star Trek where you want to commit
66:04 suicide because you are sort of in a
66:06 living loop of Nirvana you know what
66:09 I've done everything I've been every
66:12 single life force that could ever be and
66:14 I've done at all everything in a me book
66:17 could do I've done it everything you
66:18 know ant can do I've done it
66:19 same old same old eventually it's funny
66:25 just at my age late 40s
66:28 I think I've seen especially being a
66:32 screenwriter I have to write the arc of
66:35 man constantly right what does a woman
66:37 do what does a man do what does a woman
66:38 and a man do how many heroes can you
66:40 have how many villains can you have any
66:42 problems can you have any solutions can
66:43 you have I'm starting to see sort of a
66:47 real boxy world and I'm not that old and
66:53 I haven't had that many experiences on
66:56 earth to be honest and I'm already
66:58 seeing
66:59 it's imagine remembering all the
67:02 previous life's you've had I think the
67:04 greatest gift we've had is we forget and
67:07 maybe the beautiful stress-reliever is
67:10 remembering after you die what you were
67:12 and your consciousness but maybe doesn't
67:14 even matter like does it matter that a
67:16 hundred years ago or a thousand years
67:18 ago you were Nefertiti or whatever it
67:20 doesn't really matter you know some
67:23 religions think it does and they try to
67:25 you know psychoanalysis you from all
67:29 your previous sins and all that stuff
67:31 well whatever give it some thought and
67:33 tell me what you think I really want to
67:36 you know I'm trying to figure out a sort
67:40 of a mechanism or a process that I can
67:44 formalize with you guys such that I
67:46 would say at the beginning of the
67:47 episode you know it here's a crude title
67:50 to say this too crude method of saying
67:53 this which would be this is a homework
67:55 episode you know and in the end like as
67:58 you listen to the episode you got some
67:59 homework and then you go do it cuz I say
68:01 homework at the end every once in a
68:03 while maybe I should say it at the
68:04 beginning sometimes I don't know it's
68:06 gonna turn into one of those things
68:07 where I think yeah we need to get some
68:09 more brain cells in here and think about
68:10 this thing some of the debates you know
68:13 usually we're posting a lot of memes on
68:15 the locked Facebook page but some folks
68:18 have the guts to write a paragraph about
68:20 an experience and then you just go what
68:22 do you guys think those are great those
68:24 are gems man I really wish that Facebook
68:28 would allow us to within our page to
68:31 create categories I mean there are
68:33 there's a discussion thing we can do I
68:34 think I just don't think people would
68:36 click over to see it they just want to
68:38 see the feed and go go back to their
68:40 coffee right but if we could say okay
68:43 this is a mean it goes in the mean feed
68:45 if that's what you want to see this is a
68:46 discussion feed use you know maybe I'll
68:48 research that and we'll figure that out
68:50 there's still some technology to be
68:52 developed let me tell you anyhow if you
68:57 hadn't been to deep thoughts radio.com
68:58 that's where you can find all the video
69:01 feeds there's YouTube and [ __ ] you
69:02 currently so we can find the audio feeds
69:05 for the podcast Android Mac slash Apple
69:09 it's all in there easy to click and get
69:12 into
69:13 there are essentially two social media
69:15 outlets one is conversation one is just
69:18 as feeds I've been told very
69:21 specifically the Twitter's not being
69:22 listened to anymore read very much
69:26 Facebook I'm sorry it's a deep state
69:28 organization it is get in there it's
69:32 locked so your your employers and your
69:34 family members unless they become
69:35 members can't see what you're doing in
69:37 there so you know I thought they would
69:40 have interests in joining in the first
69:41 place right so get in there and have
69:42 some fun we have two ways to donate to
69:45 the page PayPal and patreon then there's
69:49 the link for the new remastered season
69:51 one there's no ads on that because I
69:53 don't have enough impressions to turn on
69:56 monetization so you just get in and get
69:57 out super quick so I have some fun with
70:00 that but anyway take care of yourself
70:03 and someone else and I'll see you in the
70:04 next deep thoughts over now
70:13 you
