00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:37 deep thoughts today I thought we'd focus
00:41 on you and focus on how we can take your
00:46 talents that you have and you have
00:48 talents but do you recognize them as
00:51 talents are not as completely up to you
00:53 and find a project that you can do to
00:58 really kind of sharpen your skills get
01:00 them maybe get the dust blown off if
01:03 you're really hot at what you do well
01:06 maybe there'll be a second half to this
01:08 where we can really get into what you
01:09 can do if you're advanced but I think
01:10 most people that are hot on their skills
01:12 I always I always start an episode about
01:16 two minutes before the ice cream truck
01:18 comes here it's kind of creepy there's a
01:21 clown driving right I always think
01:24 bucket head and Primus are gonna start
01:26 playing really fast but depending on
01:28 your age you've got either two sides of
01:30 the hemisphere Rodeo Hemisphere today
01:33 and instead of a coin yesterday I used
01:36 coins a lot either young and therefore
01:42 your skills aren't completely perfected
01:44 because you're young you're still
01:45 working on them all I can say is yes go
01:48 go go you'll never have more fun in your
01:51 life entering the work sector with a
01:55 skill that you love to do and I don't
01:57 care what it is don't look over your
01:59 shoulder to see if it impresses the guy
02:02 next to you or the girl next to you it
02:05 is all that you need if it makes you
02:08 happy does no harm usually quite the
02:11 opposite
02:12 you're ready to rock and roll but now
02:16 let's say you're maybe you're in your
02:19 30s or above you used to do this thing
02:22 all the time or you almost started doing
02:25 this thing I just pretend like I am
02:29 talking directly to you this whole
02:31 episode don't imagine me with someone
02:34 else you had this thing you used to do
02:37 and you know maybe you had one week that
02:42 you did it professionally maybe you had
02:45 six months maybe out a year maybe had a
02:46 few years maybe you've never done a
02:48 professionally but damn it it's a thing
02:50 that keeps gnawing at you I deep down
02:54 inside you know you can do it you just
02:56 need to make the time now here's the
03:00 challenge this is how yours truly gets
03:04 through these phases I'm gonna give you
03:08 a couple stories I keep saying in
03:11 episodes that I started a video game
03:13 company 2005 I founded a company okay
03:18 here's a funny thing I've been through
03:22 all kinds of different things you know I
03:24 I represent my career as having work for
03:29 one company during a particular year but
03:32 the reality is I'm I got my own company
03:34 selling software that I wrote I'm
03:36 working for this game company I'm
03:38 working for this database company I'm a
03:39 consultant to various individuals my
03:43 life hasn't almost never been I wake up
03:46 I go to work and it's just that company
03:48 in the mid 90s about 1995 I had become
03:52 one of the best database coders on the
03:56 planet and the product that I was
04:00 programming in was going was being
04:03 completely usurped slowly ever so slowly
04:08 by the internet by 1995 for those of you
04:11 know the history you've got about two
04:13 years of HTTP web pages being invented
04:17 from 93 to 94 so by 95 things are
04:21 heating up I mean by 1995 you couldn't
04:24 buy a book
04:25 had a program on the Internet Oh Riley
04:27 publishing was just getting started they
04:28 had a pearl book which I still have and
04:31 it doesn't say anything in it it's like
04:32 Perl CGI or CGI programming and it
04:35 doesn't say anything it's basically
04:36 promising you that they're writing the
04:38 book that you really want to buy
04:40 that's how freaking early this was of
04:43 course I know tons of geniuses in the
04:45 Bay Area and so one I said you know I
04:47 want to make a chatroom and and this
04:50 dude said okay you got to meet my friend
04:51 you know where you know you work with
04:53 so-and-so yeah you got to meet him and
04:54 talk to him because he'll help you out
04:56 there like the first one then maybe you
04:57 can modify it
05:00 he never completely wrote the first one
05:02 he went off to AOL and supposedly made a
05:05 gazillion dollars I went to his house
05:07 afterwards he was in a gated
05:09 neighborhood with probably like an acre
05:12 and about four cars out front
05:15 so he did well so I'm at work and I need
05:18 to learn the Internet my boss comes in
05:20 to me you know pulls me into his office
05:22 and says you're gonna program an email
05:23 package that FTP app I mean we're
05:26 talking full-blown email package with
05:28 you know the progress bars which is why
05:31 pop3 protocol exists you're gonna do a
05:35 web server a web client just boom boom
05:37 boom a million different things and I
05:39 said I don't know how to do that and he
05:41 goes I'll teach you it's easy
05:43 and he Sturgess writing on the and it
05:45 was it was so easy it was so ridiculous
05:49 but now that's not true internet
05:52 programming it was programming in our
05:54 custom language to access the internet
05:56 to deal with the protocols of our
05:59 language and then their language that is
06:00 a so I went home and this is what this
06:05 episode is all about and I created
06:06 myself a project I figured out how to
06:09 buy a domain name
06:11 I bought card Gamescom and my buddy and
06:17 I were collecting Star Wars cards made
06:19 in mid 90s from decipher card game
06:23 company which no longer exists but these
06:25 things were beautiful
06:26 and then I worked out a deal where I
06:29 could do a distribution deal and I was
06:31 buying Magic the Gathering cards and
06:32 then the brand new decipher Star Wars
06:34 cards and I was selling them online I
06:36 mean I got the credit card machine in my
06:39 house for $1,500 in 1995-96 eventually
06:44 here's the thing I didn't know how to
06:46 program HTTP or HSR HTML there were no
06:50 websites out there on this subject but I
06:53 created a project I don't know where I
06:55 got my knowledge honestly to this day
06:59 but I programmed the website if those of
07:03 you go to archive.org typing car games ,
07:05 go to 1996 and you can see this horrific
07:08 website I created way back in the day
07:12 but I'm also an artist so I needed to
07:14 figure out how to make things look
07:15 stunning there was a guy named dr. ozone
07:20 online this guy was creating the most
07:23 incredible glassy amazing buttons and he
07:27 was just phenomenal so you go to his
07:30 thing and you'd read all the
07:31 instructions on how to use Photoshop
07:33 than make it happen in Photoshop spray
07:35 lis changed since then folks 22 years
07:38 ago and it works it worked but it was
07:41 meticulous it took hours and hours to
07:43 make every single glassy button and the
07:46 plugins really hadn't arrived yet so I'm
07:49 pushing my career on the artistic side
07:51 and I'm pushing it on the programming
07:53 side I'm working with this guy John he
07:55 was kind of helping me out but he's
07:56 really busy and eventually he just kind
08:00 of dumped a project about 80% done and
08:02 so I went in there figured out the code
08:04 in Perl and got the chatroom going I
08:07 figured HTML and got the car Gamescom
08:11 going I bought stimulate calm and
08:13 stimulus calm I still own stimulus and I
08:18 created like a Facebook sort of thing
08:20 okay
08:21 for artists and people to find artists
08:24 so I could you know like a nice Art
08:26 District online with the chat room
08:29 eventually I made a prints chatroom and
08:31 that's the one that gets a wrister
08:33 records it's the one that picked up
08:35 picked it up and put in their
08:36 circulation
08:37 but I here's the thing my company is
08:39 doing extremely well up to the point the
08:42 internet had essentially convinced all
08:44 the companies of the world to stop doing
08:46 like for geo programming which is a
08:50 layer on top of the database that you
08:53 might be dealing with oracle sybase i
08:55 know this gets a little technical but
08:56 just ignore it
08:57 my company was going out business
08:59 because the internet was taking over a
09:02 bunch of people my company never went
09:05 and learned the Internet by 1997 I
09:09 jumped ship to a company that wanted
09:13 what's called a webmaster what's a
09:15 webmaster versus what you find today a
09:18 webmaster is truly someone who knows
09:20 everything about the code front and back
09:22 and everyone everything about the art
09:25 and the layout so the programming to lay
09:28 it out as well as how to make any
09:30 graphic anywhere here's the thing I'm
09:34 making a ton of money as this other type
09:36 of coder I changed industries completely
09:41 on one day I didn't lose a dime in
09:47 salary so I stepped off from pro golfing
09:51 to pro football theoretically speaking
09:56 or it could have been pro golfing to you
10:00 know running a department chain or
10:02 something I don't know but I didn't lose
10:04 any money and the way I survived that
10:07 was that I didn't sleep I needed to
10:11 learn this technology because that was
10:14 an imperative and we'll give you a
10:15 couple that weren't imperatives that
10:16 turned out beautiful for me as well but
10:19 it was giving myself a project that made
10:23 learning fun because if I had sat there
10:26 and just said oh my god I gotta learn
10:27 how to make a webpage but I don't know
10:29 what I want to make there's no purpose
10:30 right when you want to make something
10:33 look pretty well then there's a bunch of
10:35 cause and a bunch of purpose and there's
10:36 a standard and you have to meet and all
10:38 this other stuff right this is what
10:41 we're gonna do for you with whatever
10:42 skill you have I want you to start
10:43 thinking about it right now
10:44 dig that little annoying thing that
10:47 you've been repressing because it pains
10:50 you to think about how your
10:51 doing what you're supposed to be doing
10:53 let's get that out blow it off you're in
10:55 a safe room don't worry right
10:57 as this chemtrail blocks the Sun for
10:59 another second now fast forward a little
11:03 bit eventually I get so knowledgeable
11:07 about the Internet the on and off work
11:09 that I'm doing a flexion on the cards
11:12 goes full-time 100% I start running the
11:17 web department talk about making money
11:20 talk about having fun talk about
11:22 building something absolutely legendary
11:24 by 2002 I participated in architecting
11:28 and building with all my employees and
11:31 the other departments a 320 million
11:33 dollar gaming platform I think to this
11:36 day it still has the directory structure
11:37 that I laid out in a meeting in 1999 ok
11:42 a lot of brilliant people lifted a lot
11:46 of stuff but I'll tell you what we were
11:50 stuck into the wall we were stuck in the
11:51 water with a two and a half million
11:53 dollar a month consultants they couldn't
11:55 engineer their way out of a paper bag
11:57 and you're truly walked in the room at
12:00 29 and said what's taking so damn long
12:03 here's how we do this boom boom boom
12:05 boom boom laid it all out any questions
12:07 none walked out of that room and it
12:10 finally started getting made just unreal
12:12 but now how was I able to do that at 29
12:14 years old with a whole room full of guys
12:16 in their 30s 40s and some in their 50s
12:20 because I had projects stimulus calm car
12:26 games which eventually sold to the sky a
12:28 couple grand the projects got me through
12:33 the learning curve now fast forward to
12:35 2004 I'm here at this house now I've
12:38 been here a year I'll try to figure out
12:41 what I want to do you know the dot-com
12:44 bust was happening you know over 80% of
12:48 the world was not on the Internet
12:49 I'm an Internet professional and I can't
12:51 find a job unbelievable but a my old
12:55 employees from Electronic Arts calls me
12:57 and he had moved down from the Bay Area
12:59 as well and he lives in North LA he's
13:02 like man I got a gig to make video games
13:04 and I'm running out a resource
13:05 as I can't I can't do them all can you
13:07 do one for me Michael what are we doing
13:09 here and he says we're making games in
13:11 flash I said oh I I bought a book called
13:16 flash for Unleashed it's been sitting on
13:21 my bookshelf for a year let me yeah sure
13:26 which one can we do and he mentioned
13:28 [ __ ] I think it was called seven seas
13:30 from PopCap and I love that game I
13:33 played the real game online somehow
13:36 through a Java app or whatever it was
13:38 and we're making video games these games
13:40 were destined for a Time Warner Cable
13:42 box an IC TV platform and so I cracked
13:49 this book out and of course there's
13:51 sample code online and so I'm like I'm
13:54 super excited I bought this book with a
13:56 full intent to learn how to program it
13:57 flash a video game I've done a lot of
14:00 animations up to this pawn I even won a
14:03 David Bowie web site award I think in
14:07 1999 maybe 2000 lined up a screen
14:11 capture of it for stimulus com so David
14:13 Bowie and his team picked the stimulus
14:17 calm
14:17 isn't that cool or did you know it's the
14:21 design also this stuff it's pretty
14:22 beautiful so I started reading this book
14:27 and I had a project all of a sudden it's
14:30 seven seas I love seven seas and the
14:33 other thing was that they really wanted
14:35 to be super object oriented and at that
14:37 point you could you could program up to
14:39 that point and not do object-oriented
14:41 programming
14:41 yeah everywhere because the internet you
14:44 know JavaScript wasn't know yet and at
14:47 least we had to figure out how to really
14:48 trick it to be that way now it's a cinch
14:52 so I get into it
14:53 I do it it's kind of a Frankenstein
14:56 version of the app but it works great
14:58 they're able to release it and then I
15:02 called my partner and I said look my
15:04 buddy and I said look let's make a
15:05 company here because we're gonna make a
15:10 lot more money if we have a c-corp
15:12 behind us and we look we get organized
15:14 so he and I sat up all night looking for
15:17 domains you know we we
15:19 thinking of company names and we throw
15:20 it in as a dot-com and if it was taking
15:22 money on comm we just said screw it I'm
15:24 not gonna spill it funny we're not
15:25 getting a dotnet or some [ __ ] sure
15:29 enough we came up with 1 0 G games
15:32 incorporated I went to legal zone got
15:38 the C Corp though we'd never file for a
15:42 corporation until you have a client
15:43 that's gonna pay you enough money to
15:46 make your corporate fees every year if
15:48 you happen to live in California or a
15:50 state that hasn't paid for automatically
15:53 right because it's costly to shut them
15:55 down I keep the site up it's just a
15:59 fraction of what we did so right now as
16:03 of 2018 I am resurrecting my knowledge
16:08 in all electronics because I love
16:14 electronics I love dealing with these
16:15 things and you know in the end it's all
16:17 really simple it's really simple it's
16:20 really just a bunch of code of
16:21 simplistic things and it depends on how
16:24 you want to contextually bring it
16:25 together where the complication comes in
16:27 which is where your imagination takes
16:29 over I want you to remember this so I
16:32 bought God five years ago whatever and
16:36 Arduino circuit at least five years ago
16:41 and it's a little tiny circuit board
16:42 about this big it's a teeny tiny
16:43 computer and I just kept it in the box I
16:49 also bought some robotic expansion pack
16:51 didn't always I bought I forgot to buy
16:53 the original robot that's supposed to be
16:55 attached to it and also there's stuff so
16:56 about a year ago I had a reason to get
17:00 into this because I'm getting into AC
17:02 chip technology for a very specific
17:06 purpose but I know that I need a project
17:09 I know I got to buy some more parts
17:13 I no longer owned a soldering iron and
17:16 her longer owned a voltage meter I
17:18 hadn't delve into these chips in a
17:21 really long time there's constantly new
17:23 companies there's Adafruit out there out
17:26 of fruit by the way ladies
17:28 it's a da fruit comm if you want to see
17:33 a powerful female kicking some serious
17:35 serious ass in the world go look about a
17:38 fruit if you haven't heard of it heard
17:40 of her she's an MIT grad but instead of
17:44 getting her PhD thesis all worked out
17:46 she started selling Arduino kit parts
17:49 she'd built like a project with her
17:51 Arduino and then she'd she lists the
17:53 parts and sell them in a bag and send
17:55 them to people out of her apartment in
17:56 New York and eventually flipped that and
18:00 I think even less than 10 years it's
18:03 less than a decade old she now has a 50
18:05 million dollar a year company in a
18:07 couple thousand square foot warehouse in
18:10 Manhattan New York like most of the most
18:12 expensive real estate on planet earth
18:14 this girl is
18:16 she's got pink hair super chill relaxed
18:20 she she talks like a normal human being
18:23 she makes everything fun I mean she is
18:25 truly just an example of the way it used
18:30 to be I'm gonna make an episode on
18:32 What's My Line the old up a still show
18:34 from the 50s and we're gonna rip apart
18:36 this idea that women or anything other
18:39 than what this woman is for out of fruit
18:41 I forget her name I think it's lorem
18:44 anyway amazing but I need a project and
18:48 so I'm gonna keep a little secret but
18:51 the project exactly is but I've given
18:53 myself an electronics project no one's
18:57 telling me to do it I'm doing it
19:00 and it is a project that is so wide in
19:06 scope that I'm going to be using
19:09 virtually every single part that the
19:13 Arduino line has at its disposal so I'm
19:19 going to learn every little sensor every
19:20 little mechanism of
19:23 everything and I'm super excited and
19:26 I've been going at it now it also
19:29 happens to help me in other professional
19:31 endeavors so this is you I wanted to
19:35 give you at least 15 minutes of examples
19:37 because I need you to understand it's
19:40 fun with YouTube the level of
19:46 do-it-yourself is off the chain right
19:50 even hacks if you don't have a lot of
19:52 money they have cheap ways to get things
19:55 done in addition to my electronics
19:59 project I have discovered using the web
20:02 a group that's close by
20:05 I think it's meetup comm or something
20:07 like that meetup org a group that meets
20:09 weekly I can even actually monthly in my
20:13 neighborhood and I'm going to go meet
20:15 them for dinner this coming next week
20:18 and I have all my questions all ready to
20:20 go I'm trying to do my best to do you
20:23 know to answer my own questions such
20:25 that I don't you know bore them to death
20:27 and so I'm working with others so I can
20:30 speed this process up so how do you make
20:33 a project that is a right for you just
20:38 slightly a complex question this may be
20:40 as complex as it ever gets which is fun
20:43 right you want to create a project that
20:45 meets a few requirements for you the
20:49 number one thing that your project has
20:52 to do is super excite you about the
20:57 final outcome alright and trying to
21:04 think of how the best way to say this in
21:05 a figurative way so that applies to all
21:07 of you with your various talents and
21:09 your various desires but it might be
21:12 that you're creating something that no
21:14 one's ever seen before
21:16 that's a good one that's usually where I
21:18 go inventing something completely brand
21:20 new the second thing is that you want
21:23 your project to have a I think a fairly
21:26 decent scope however you don't have to
21:29 do that I like that because then I know
21:32 everything when I'm done I know the
21:34 majority of everything I give an example
21:35 when I was a kid
21:37 and I had my trs-80 cocoa color computer
21:40 I think I diversion to Edie came with
21:44 this fold-out card which had it was
21:46 about probably about a foot wide eight
21:50 inches tall I had every single command
21:51 on front and back of this card this
21:53 little trite or Quadra fold card and I
21:57 would make a program that would use as
22:01 many of those commands as possible
22:03 such that when I was done with the
22:05 program I knew how to use every command
22:08 in the whole language when I finally got
22:12 to this program I wrote called key paint
22:15 which if you guys go to Coco central
22:18 comm you can see a site that I keep up
22:21 that will give you all your old trs-80
22:23 manuals emulators cards but I also put
22:26 the key painting program up there so you
22:28 can just see some code I wrote when I
22:30 was 15 it's a pain the ass to get that
22:33 code inside of an emulator but it had
22:36 everything it had booting up going into
22:38 graphics mode converting the keyboard
22:40 presses and to drawing on the screen you
22:43 can kick it into font mode and type 'abc
22:45 through Z they only came time to save
22:47 you could save with horizontal lines
22:48 vertical lines it all had run line
22:50 encoding and built-in and it was great
22:55 so disk i/o you know hidden out which is
22:59 a cassette tape basically you could read
23:02 your drawing back from a cassette tape
23:04 just sit there and draw it right in
23:05 front your face it draws it back ok but
23:10 if if a big scope freaks you out then
23:14 fine
23:15 don't get freaked out make a teeny tiny
23:17 app that just kind of digs into an area
23:19 you know I'm gonna create a little
23:21 application or if I push the button it
23:23 makes it a pixel on the screen light up
23:25 there there's a lot of complexity in
23:27 just that little tiny thing
23:29 you might get to a point real like all I
23:32 want to do is save I'm just gonna hit
23:35 run on the application it's gonna save
23:37 the text hello world into file on my
23:40 computer since the teeny Tony like that
23:42 the cool thing is unlike the 80s you
23:46 have the Internet and one of the neatest
23:48 things you can do is if there is a book
23:51 for sale for what you're trying to do
23:53 even non-technical things of course
23:55 everything's technical right I want to
23:57 move a little palm tree to the front
23:58 yard there's technical requirements to
24:00 get that done one of the tricks is that
24:03 you find a book that is on the subject
24:06 that you're interested in now again
24:08 YouTube has got everything so you really
24:11 books are nice I love books they're nice
24:14 to carry around if you might want to
24:15 carry a book in your back yard not an
24:16 iPad I recommend it
24:19 but most books have sort of like sample
24:21 things that you can download that come
24:23 with the book little companion things
24:25 for those of you were coders virtually
24:27 every coding book has sample chapters
24:30 that said we're building this project
24:32 we're building a video game well the
24:34 freaking codes online for free at the
24:35 publisher just go get the sample code my
24:39 only request is if the book changes your
24:41 life like Flash unleashed change my
24:45 entire life made a bunch of people a ton
24:48 of money eventually I bought the book
24:51 but eventually thank the author you know
24:54 but if it if it works you just buy it if
24:58 you haven't bought it say little things
25:00 right but get clever the Internet is
25:05 your friend the amount of times that old
25:09 people and their 40s and up call me up
25:12 on the phone and say well how do I do
25:15 this and I said well you were capable of
25:19 asking me with your voice right what do
25:22 you mean you're able to use words to ask
25:24 me right yeah well type that into Google
25:27 would you oh okay unbelievable if you're
25:33 young in this world let me tell you
25:35 you're so fortunate in some ways but now
25:39 here's the thing
25:40 but yet take this project let's say it's
25:43 fairly fairly extensive project you know
25:46 I don't wanna say hard because if you
25:48 love what you do trust me
25:50 the pain of what you're doing will may
25:52 never show up just so you know but you
25:54 may actually run into some issues I'll
25:58 give an example from my recent project
26:00 that I've been working on which has
26:02 several stages
26:03 which is what about to get into I needed
26:06 what's called a multiplexer chip and for
26:09 those of you who never want to learn
26:10 this stuff all it does is it takes one
26:14 wire from your computer and it turns it
26:17 into sixteen wires or eight wires or
26:20 whatever you're looking for so it
26:21 actually multiplies up the number of
26:23 ports and all you need to do you need to
26:25 know you need to do is that the power
26:29 strip into a power outlet at your house
26:31 you only got two on the wall and you
26:33 plug that power strip in and it gives
26:34 you a six right you put another power
26:36 strip on the bottom it gives you another
26:37 six and so you've got 12 little power
26:40 strips it's the exact same thing except
26:42 it does it at a microchip level all
26:45 right so head off to my local electronic
26:47 store it's called Fry's and I'm sitting
26:49 in front of this wall of chips and I'm
26:51 like I just need the someone so chip and
26:54 it's nowhere to be found nowhere to be
26:57 found they have a funky brand that just
27:02 doesn't carry it so I found one it was
27:04 kind of similar it said multiplexer on
27:05 it and it's super complicated compared
27:09 to the ones that I'm supposed to be
27:10 using so I'll bring on the super
27:12 complicated one it only cost like a
27:14 dollar fifty and I am trying to figure
27:17 this damn thing out I'm downloading the
27:20 schematics online I'm looking at this
27:21 thing on Jesus I will figure this thing
27:23 out it took four days for yours truly to
27:27 figure it out
27:28 but the way I figured out was I looked
27:29 at the ones I'm socially buying and I
27:30 looked at this one I said well they're
27:32 similar up to this point that's a more
27:35 honest thing together I got LEDs
27:37 attached to it and it's supposed to be
27:38 just one that can gate logic right so
27:41 it's supposed to be three pairs of two
27:44 LEDs I just did red green red green red
27:46 green there's a nice Christmas spirit
27:49 thing
27:50 but they never would light up and I'm
27:52 like son-of-a-bitch and so finally one
27:55 night on the fourth night it's probably
27:57 10 o'clock at night I took the power out
27:59 and I put it in one of the other pins
28:01 and boom a set of two of them lit up
28:03 it's like oh my god right a couple more
28:06 power lines to it and sure enough my
28:08 logic is running then they're rotating
28:10 they're on/off switches and I'm just
28:12 like the holy [ __ ] I figured this thing
28:14 out COO so you're gonna have moments
28:18 like that as well now depending on what
28:22 you're getting into it is something that
28:23 you love don't pick don't pick my stuff
28:25 pick your stuff if you dig my stuff and
28:28 let's do it together right the idea is
28:30 you want to do whatever the hell it is
28:32 you want to learn how to make surfboards
28:34 like I've seen these guys they smoke
28:36 weed all day there's got to be something
28:38 I can get into I just got to buy this
28:40 stuff right so probably the best thing
28:44 you do to start off is to figure out the
28:45 subject matter try to do something where
28:48 you can get an extensive understanding
28:49 of what it is you're getting into and
28:53 try to chop it into smaller pieces right
28:56 again if you wanted to be a doctor and
28:59 you're not anywhere near being a doctor
29:02 you know you've got three degrees you
29:03 need to get within each degree you have
29:06 to chop it up in little pieces right now
29:09 thank God we're not talking about
29:11 becoming a doctor right talk about
29:15 fixing up old cars we're talking about
29:17 maybe doing some gardening talking about
29:19 being a becoming a master chef we're
29:22 talking about learning how to make
29:24 clothing maybe whatever floats your boat
29:27 man gonna be a big electronics crew a
29:30 big programmer whatever it is you want
29:33 to build the next iPod in your freaking
29:35 house some drone that flies around and
29:38 does something right see if you can
29:41 phase your project phases are just
29:44 stages they're milestones
29:45 well phase one is just getting this
29:47 thing figured out
29:48 right it might be that you need to
29:52 actually acquire a lot of items in this
29:56 world to really get done what you need
29:57 done but you don't have money all you
30:01 don't have enough money to buy it all at
30:02 once
30:04 that's fine before you spend all that
30:06 money a good investor would tell you
30:08 look don't go and blow all that money on
30:11 everything get a phase one in your brain
30:15 and make sure that you get to face one
30:19 first cheaply as possible and fill your
30:21 heart feel like you feel if you're still
30:23 into it right we're going to talk about
30:25 the heart going through a wavering
30:28 moment in the middle of your project too
30:30 because it's important that you don't
30:31 lose steam and that you don't think that
30:33 hardship is is a sign from God that you
30:36 should stop has nothing to do with that
30:38 at all but one thing I've learned from
30:41 an investor he had some brilliant things
30:45 about him which I really respect he
30:48 taught me that as a slave I got this
30:54 episode called sovereign slavery it's
30:57 about us convincing us that were
30:58 sovereign that we're free but we're
30:59 actually still slaves we think you need
31:03 something you go out and buy it
31:04 especially in the modern age in the
31:07 Midwest not so much you don't have a lot
31:09 of money in the Midwest and so you
31:10 jerry-rigged stuff together to get it
31:12 done and in the end and some of the most
31:14 endearing stuff you'll ever be involved
31:18 with that you'll ever create so what I
31:21 can say is beg and borrow don't steal
31:25 but use every utility in your home to
31:28 get done the first phase of what you're
31:29 doing before you spend a bunch of money
31:31 because it's easy right there's a bunch
31:34 of wife's out there that know their
31:36 husbands go out and buy everything to
31:39 fix up a car or everything to work wood
31:42 and then they never use it again you buy
31:45 a bunch of exercise equipment and you
31:47 don't do it so overwhelming you know you
31:49 got the Nautilus machines and also their
31:50 stuff it's just so huge it overwhelms
31:53 you instead of using you know I don't
31:56 know buckets of water to get your biceps
31:58 going first you know or whatever it is
32:00 you know some old crappy weights earn
32:04 the next level of equipment that's what
32:08 I try to do once you get the phase one
32:12 complete you start to feel amazing
32:16 but now let me give you a piece of
32:18 advice from Ray Bradbury that I got
32:22 directly from the guy back in the late
32:24 80s 1989 as a matter of fact he said
32:29 look do not run around running your
32:35 mouth this I'm paraphrasing running your
32:37 mouth about the project you're getting
32:39 into about how great it's going to be to
32:41 anyone else keep that all inside for the
32:45 day that you finish what he was talking
32:48 about is being a writer he said one of
32:50 the common mistakes of novelists is that
32:53 they come up with a great idea and they
32:55 can't wait to get the prize for that
32:57 good idea and so they run around giving
32:59 out premise notes and story notes so
33:03 that this is gonna be so great it's
33:04 gonna be so huge big spaceship big
33:06 explosion it's gonna be a movie it's
33:08 gonna be a three-parter the problem is
33:12 is they're taking the piss on their
33:13 project as the British people would say
33:15 they are taking the steam out of it all
33:18 that energy that they needed in their
33:20 chests in their heart to finish the
33:22 novel which is the ass-kicking process
33:25 if you've ever tried it or a film and
33:28 they blow it all on a little tiny reward
33:32 that isn't real imagine giving yourself
33:35 an Oscar the day you had the idea to
33:38 write the script you don't have anything
33:40 in on paper at all but you go and get an
33:42 Oscar and you just give it to yourself
33:43 and you stand up in your living room to
33:45 your family and you give the big
33:46 acceptance speech well you're gonna
33:49 really write that script now you've
33:50 already gotten the complete reward cycle
33:52 of your concept as they said in the old
33:58 80s rap white lines don't do it so if
34:02 you've never done this before
34:03 it might sound easy but it's actually
34:06 kind of tough to hold it in hold in your
34:08 excitement right now might be that you
34:11 have a family you might be you have some
34:13 friends and then you come in your circle
34:15 and I'll tell you what there's nothing
34:16 more exciting than being Willy Wonka
34:18 this is harder in my life
34:22 because I adhere to as best I possibly
34:25 can Ray Bradbury's notion every single
34:28 time I've ever rubbed my mouth about
34:29 something that's going on my life it
34:30 does it just totally disappears it's
34:33 amazing it's like a law of the universe
34:36 there's nothing cooler than you know
34:39 being that guy that goes in goes out
34:41 goes in goes I he's the only one that
34:42 goes in at the Hopa Lupe's are in there
34:44 doing their thing helping you out which
34:46 is your like imaginary Muse and then you
34:49 walk out with it you know when I wrote
34:52 the sequel for Tron Legacy my version of
34:58 it which I gave directly to the director
35:00 of the first one it blew him away
35:05 completely blew away he's looking at me
35:06 as like I can't believe you wrote this
35:08 you know gave it to my other buddy you
35:13 know blew his mind
35:14 blew his money loved it that's the way
35:17 you want it because even if you don't
35:19 get your Oscar
35:20 it never gets made at least you did it
35:22 people got entertained by it right begin
35:26 people will tell you that they have
35:28 things that they love and you go what's
35:30 your loving like oh I love doing this
35:32 and again it should be all over their
35:33 world right some former fashion a lot
35:36 things are computerized so you don't
35:37 necessarily print everything out but you
35:41 should have something but this investor
35:43 taught me that you can get a lot of
35:44 stuff that you need without spending
35:46 money you can take it like I needed a
35:48 soldering iron I thought about you know
35:50 getting $15 ones I thought about you
35:53 know asking a friend but I know I'm
35:56 gonna need this thing for a really long
35:57 time I'm never gonna be giving it back
35:59 in the short term there's a lot of
36:04 advances in soldering they try to get
36:06 away from lead solder they also a lot of
36:09 times will make sure that you have the
36:10 solder at a particular temperature and
36:13 the cheaper ones don't have any method
36:15 of measuring temperature you plug them
36:17 in they just hit a certain finite
36:18 hotness so I spend a little extra money
36:23 not much and I got one has a temperature
36:26 gauge on it so I can see what the hell
36:27 I'm doing I want to burn up a component
36:30 I mean that'll be a you know imagine
36:32 it's two o'clock in the morning I almost
36:35 have
36:35 to sing together oops I forgot to solder
36:37 that thing and I get this thing way
36:38 overheated and I touch it and burns out
36:40 the chip burns up the the board I don't
36:44 want that opponents are not always right
36:47 next door right now I'm gonna caution
36:52 you here I've done this so many times
36:54 that for me I like to pick projects that
36:56 are big because in my Bryant in my mind
36:59 I can celebrate the little milestones
37:01 all by myself and I'm completely
37:02 satisfied with my own alkaloids for
37:04 doing stuff you may want to pick a bunch
37:07 of tiny ones super tiny ones just to get
37:10 yourself started but now I talk about
37:12 that whole idea of celebrating your idea
37:14 with the outside world
37:16 one of the things that I bumped into
37:19 probably my 20s that may or may not plug
37:22 any of you is celebrating too hard with
37:25 yourself okay what does that mean
37:30 what if you were sitting there for 10
37:33 years if you're younger 2 years it'll
37:36 feel like 10 and you're like I think I
37:39 can do this I think maybe it's a guitar
37:42 solo that's all you want to do is play
37:44 guitar solo whatever it is and
37:47 eventually you do it right all this time
37:51 you've been doubting yourself or
37:53 delaying because you don't want to fail
37:55 right very typical everybody has that by
37:58 the way you're a musician you used to
38:02 make albums she never do anymore
38:05 but you're like goddammit I have at
38:06 least 20 songs in my chest I just need
38:09 to get one of them out the door and then
38:10 that will give me the snowball to go
38:12 down the hill and you're correct but
38:15 there's one little thing that can set
38:17 you off course and I have done it a
38:20 million times okay and I think it's her
38:23 so this is one that I did I did a guitar
38:28 solo on a song way back in 1994 okay and
38:33 it really worked out took me a long time
38:34 to get all the different techniques
38:36 worked out and get a song going and it's
38:38 not amazing but it's definitely worked
38:40 out got some praise from my friends but
38:43 the problem was is I in my brain said I
38:47 can do that now
38:49 and then my desire died off immediately
38:52 stupid I hadn't really created a good
38:55 one but I allowed myself to take the
38:58 praise from my friends and my own praise
39:00 if or really my own praise goes like
39:02 this holy [ __ ] we actually did it right
39:05 you never thought you could but you did
39:07 and I never focused on it ever again
39:10 ever again
39:12 crazy all right songs melodies all that
39:16 kind of stuff that this is something you
39:18 got to do if you want to get into music
39:20 right so be careful with under
39:24 estimating yourself because the more you
39:27 underestimate yourself the more that
39:28 you're gonna give yourself jaw-dropping
39:32 praise when the basics of life simply
39:34 occur in front of your face this is very
39:36 common don't underestimate yourself at
39:40 all any of that doubt you have you know
39:45 I would say doubt is a bit like dust
39:50 let's dust due to your home you have a
39:54 bunch of cool stuff in your house if you
39:57 live by the beach and you open a window
39:59 you'll learn all about dust in a
40:02 completely different way we have this
40:04 weird dust and I don't know if it's from
40:06 the sky I think it's from the beach we
40:08 always have a good breeze going on as
40:10 you can hear and the microphone most
40:11 likely and it fills up your house with
40:13 this weird dust dust is supposed to be
40:19 skin mites but I guess in California
40:23 it's dirt anyway it's all over the place
40:26 you know that if you dust and you wipe
40:29 it all off all the sudden that that
40:33 stain you got your TV on your TV your
40:36 computer desk the kitchen the corner
40:39 down there by the door all your molding
40:41 in your house it all starts to look what
40:45 brand-new and amazing right and then you
40:48 start to realize when you dust you're
40:50 like [ __ ] this stuff has always looked
40:51 amazing it's just my lazy-ass that lets
40:53 dust get on it make it look old that's
40:56 the reason why I feel like I live in a
40:57 crap hole every once in a while
40:59 and dust is a weird thing it's an
41:01 interesting you know analogy for life
41:05 it's sort of one of these things where
41:07 you you start to think you have lost
41:11 track of your cycles and you need to
41:15 step up to the plate to get this done
41:17 because unless you have a maid and then
41:19 gonna do itself right it's interesting
41:22 where your talents are just like the
41:26 furniture in your house it's still
41:29 pristine underneath all this doubt /
41:32 dust we talk about blowing the dust off
41:36 stuff it's very real you're blowing the
41:38 dust off inside your head for the
41:40 project that you want to do now let me
41:44 give you another little reality here
41:46 some of your gonna have this and some of
41:48 you won't if you are doing anything in
41:51 your life for the praise of others brace
41:54 yourself
41:55 it may never show up until the final
41:58 product starts to really succeed what do
42:01 I mean by that well let's say you live
42:04 with your parents and it's a very common
42:08 thing to want praise from your parent
42:10 right I never really lived for this
42:15 particular thing even though I've had my
42:16 my issues with my parents like all other
42:18 kids but you may want it from your
42:22 friends your teachers the public at
42:25 large the only thing you want to really
42:30 get praise for is following your dreams
42:35 and doing what you love you want to be
42:38 an inspiration to other people trust me
42:40 for instance if you wrote a song and you
42:45 made some great lyrics and you made some
42:47 great music around this great lyrics
42:49 that's usually how songs go you know
42:51 completely one-hit wonder and at a
42:55 minimum now there's someone who wonders
42:59 that have the weirdest lyrics on planet
43:00 earth but whatever reason a bunch of
43:04 people loved your song and they bought
43:05 the song and you paid millions of
43:07 dollars hopefully right
43:10 and you're gonna travel the world being
43:13 this pop star rock star a rap star
43:16 whatever it is and people come up to you
43:18 man that's also dope that song so
43:20 amazing oh my god your drum solo so
43:22 great whatever whatever whatever you're
43:24 gonna dig that trust me you're gonna
43:26 enjoy that but after a while that's not
43:29 going to do it for you because that
43:30 pattern of praise is going to just get
43:32 old real fast but there's going to be
43:36 two other people that can come up to you
43:39 about your work
43:42 there's actually three but someone's
43:44 gonna come up to you and say those
43:45 lyrics that you wrote my god my life was
43:49 in a really weird spot and I just needed
43:52 those lyrics all right when I got a
43:54 chance to tell cool Jade how much
43:56 breakthrough which is what actually
43:58 funny Kanye West is starting to say he's
44:00 had a breakthrough which is funny but
44:02 cool Jays song breakthrough gave me all
44:04 the strength I needed to stay on target
44:06 when I got to California completely by
44:07 myself with no money and he looked at me
44:11 and he goes you're the reason why I
44:12 wrote these songs for him it was more
44:15 the message getting out to the kids and
44:18 giving them confidence to get their
44:20 dreams so a year and a half older than
44:21 me right but he touched me my brothers
44:26 from another mother
44:27 Bobby blots are from rat we've done you
44:32 know Havasu trips together and I
44:35 remember one of the first Havasu trips
44:37 who went we had to fill up gas and that
44:39 in the boat and it's just he and I at
44:43 the first day and we pull up and we're
44:46 putting this you know billion gallons in
44:48 this boat and we go inside the
44:50 convenience store
44:52 and there's an older woman who's our age
44:54 working the cash register and there's a
44:57 younger kid at the end of the counter
44:59 and he's just sort of sitting there and
45:00 he's looking and I'm thinking okay she
45:06 may recognize Bobby the kid definitely
45:08 won't because what is he like he might
45:10 have been between 18 and 22 somewhere in
45:12 there the woman didn't say anything the
45:16 kids looking at Bob and he's like are
45:20 you Bobby blood sir and he's like yeah
45:22 and he goes because I just want you to
45:25 know I played the drums because of you
45:27 because my dad played your albums all
45:29 the time and I heard your stuff and I
45:32 realized it was a little different than
45:33 the rest and he took me to some concerts
45:36 and he goes I play the drums now because
45:39 of you I guarantee you that that
45:42 compliment met a hell of a lot more than
45:44 I love your music who knows what that
45:48 kid will do he was young enough he could
45:50 be in the next band of his own volition
45:52 his own brain his own genre that's you
45:57 you will have a stage where you're the
45:59 kid and then you'll have a stage where
46:01 you're Bobby or Cool J or whatever it is
46:06 you have no idea how it will touch the
46:09 world when the actress who plays a [ __ ]
46:11 oh I apologize for not remembering her
46:14 name on Star Trek in the 60s she was one
46:18 of the first black females to have a
46:20 commanding role in a series on
46:22 television I mean they treat her with
46:24 complete respect she was a cornerstone
46:26 to the operation of the Star Trek
46:28 Enterprise she's on the bridge she's
46:31 made up to look Ashley gorgeous our
46:33 genetics didn't hurt either but there's
46:35 a famous story when she decided to quit
46:37 before the show was over and it went out
46:40 in the press that she was going to quit
46:42 in between seasons and who walks up to
46:46 her and says don't you dare quit none
46:50 other than Martin Luther King bumps into
46:53 her somewhere and pulls her aside and
46:55 says I hear that you're going to quit
46:57 Star Trek and she's like yeah and he was
46:59 why she goes well I'm a singer dancer I
47:03 love Broadway and I
47:05 really don't I'm not I don't think this
47:07 this TV thing is really doing it for me
47:09 and he says you can't quit and she says
47:12 why and he says because Star Trek is the
47:16 only television show I allow my children
47:18 to watch and I let them watch it because
47:21 you were on the show I want them to see
47:23 not only a black person be powerful on
47:25 the show but a black female be powerful
47:28 on the show and so she stayed on the
47:31 show again
47:35 you could be a hora in your own way in
47:38 your own domain so I want you to take
47:42 your dream seriously I want you to take
47:44 your endeavor seriously everyone you
47:47 know we throw in this phrase all the
47:48 time that you have a talent that God
47:50 gave you a talent I believe that a
47:53 thousand percent
47:55 but sadly a large majority of the
47:59 population is never told that statement
48:02 and they don't have it backed up by
48:05 someone to say no no no it's not a joke
48:08 it's not a little aphorism for you to
48:11 feel good about yourself it is real and
48:14 so let's find it let's turn it on and
48:16 let's make something right you're never
48:20 too old to find one of your loves and
48:23 make it happen
48:24 right and let me give you some examples
48:30 of having dreams to do things that you
48:35 don't think you have the ability to do
48:37 anymore or maybe ever and we'll go after
48:42 a couple here various distinct ones that
48:44 I see all the time let's say you're 5
48:47 foot 4 girl and you love basketball and
48:50 you're damn good at it when you're in a
48:52 playground when you're at middle school
48:54 or high school but you know when you get
48:56 to college you're gonna have to be 5 10
48:58 or higher to play in any college league
49:03 because they can find girls way taller
49:04 than you who are also as good as you
49:06 maybe even better
49:07 but you love basketball they love it you
49:10 love the sport whereas a million things
49:13 you can do in basketball for your entire
49:15 life at 5-4 that will help those people
49:18 who are
49:19 five ten to seven feet tall plus you
49:22 could do a little technique in your
49:24 little body and teach it to someone
49:26 who's bigger and say as long as you can
49:27 figure out what I'm doing at five four
49:29 you're gonna murder all those people out
49:31 there on the court
49:33 perhaps you become a coach perhaps you
49:35 become a statistician you're some aide
49:39 maybe you become a news reporter because
49:41 you love this to statistics and you love
49:43 reporting who's doing better and you get
49:45 behind all the individual players and
49:48 your ass tactician for the news I mean
49:51 we know that females have utterly
49:53 dominated at least 50% of sports because
49:56 guys like sports like women and they
49:58 like hearing them Beverly it's really
50:00 sexy for sports addicts to have a really
50:03 sexy woman forgive the formulas not mine
50:08 talk about sports you know it's like the
50:12 the woman who likes a guy that knows how
50:14 to shop for shoes he's my he's my
50:16 shopping buddy right he's a man and he
50:19 loves you know he knows what the colored
50:22 mob is right there's all kinds of ways
50:25 you can participate in what you love
50:27 even if you can't perceivably be the
50:30 center of attention maybe you look
50:34 awkward maybe you like to eat cake all
50:36 day and for whatever reason music you
50:39 know the record companies just look at
50:41 you and they go well you're not really a
50:43 leading man in a band and your voice is
50:46 okay I tell you what we got a job we got
50:50 a job with that those kind of people
50:52 that you admire you can be a road
50:55 manager you have to look like anything
50:57 and you can be as deeply involved in a
50:59 rock band as you want you become a sound
51:02 engineer you actually get to help make
51:04 them music you'll work as a sound
51:06 engineer you'll work more on a song than
51:08 the artists themselves
51:09 alright the artists will come in do you
51:13 know a few eight-hour days singing on a
51:15 song and you're gonna spend a month to
51:18 six months re mixing that song until
51:20 it's absolutely perfect and when it goes
51:22 out and becomes Gundam style right a
51:25 Gundam style whatever we call it you're
51:28 really the reason why it sounds the way
51:29 it sounds
51:30 you're the reason why it sounds good in
51:32 a car and it sounds good on a computer
51:34 and it sounds good in in concert because
51:37 you mixed it believe me there are gold
51:42 statues for everyone along the way how
51:46 many times you've you seen the Oscars
51:47 and which you know it's kind of a
51:49 [ __ ] award at this point but you see
51:51 the Oscars and you're you're seeing
51:53 people get awards for things that you
51:54 don't even you didn't know what that was
51:58 trust me they don't get it because it's
52:00 completely trivial
52:01 they just don't now what are you gonna
52:04 find difficult in the middle this
52:05 process well if you're like me you're
52:09 gonna have a lot of things that you love
52:11 in this world so simply picking one over
52:12 the other means one of them dies or at
52:15 least gets put on hold for a little
52:16 while and that's sort of a rough it's a
52:20 rough process to go through my Jesus I
52:22 really want to write a song I really
52:24 want to get back into my guitar but
52:26 that's not gonna really pay the bills in
52:28 any significant way unless a miracle
52:31 happens suppose you're my age unless I'm
52:34 like well okay I got to pick the one
52:35 that is equally interesting and it can
52:40 give me a career for the rest of my life
52:42 right some of the most interesting
52:46 people I meet and this is again the way
52:48 it was on what's my line show back in
52:50 the from 1850 1968 you have a lot of
52:54 both men and women who invented
52:56 something and they all they do is make
52:58 that thing you know there's a woman that
53:00 makes custom saddles here in California
53:03 was on the show on the show just to give
53:06 you kind of a perspective of how
53:07 powerful this can be for your life they
53:10 used to give you 50 bucks if you could
53:11 convince the ER if you could confuse the
53:13 panelists as to what your job was you
53:15 have to answer yes or no questions
53:16 ten knows and you win fifty bucks the
53:19 fifty bucks
53:20 amortized up for today from 1950 it's
53:23 about five hundred fifty dollars of
53:26 course that went down from that to 1968
53:28 but it wasn't really about winning the
53:29 money it was about having fun on the
53:30 show
53:31 okay this woman comes on like 58 or
53:34 something like that and she makes
53:35 saddles
53:37 so after she confuses the panel in
53:40 Windsor 50 bucks the host says okay you
53:44 can buy this person saddles for starting
53:47 at $2,500 and you're looking at 50 bucks
53:52 is $550 a saddle for a horse he says it
53:56 could be a little bit more I think he
53:58 said up to $6,000 if you put silver on
54:01 it and it gets all nicely embroidered
54:02 into the into the leather right think
54:06 about that this person is earning the
54:10 purchase price of a house for selling a
54:12 saddle self-made person took a love and
54:17 went with it that's you that's you I
54:22 know a lot of things have been invented
54:24 in this world and you might think well
54:25 there's nothing new that can never be
54:26 invented and that's [ __ ] that is so
54:30 much crap what you also find in your
54:33 life if you're trying to figure out a
54:34 project is that if you love something
54:36 you're gonna know what's missing in that
54:38 love right I love listening to music you
54:41 know I'll ask you well how do you listen
54:43 to music well yeah just my phone
54:45 whatever iPad iPod whatever iPad
54:48 computer home stereo car stereo I'll say
54:53 well what what sucks about that is those
54:55 things what do you mean well if you
54:59 could make it better
55:00 I mean if you could have your fantasy
55:02 how would you listen to music and they
55:04 start thinking they're struck oh well I
55:06 guess I wouldn't have to carry around
55:08 anything all the time and I could hear
55:10 music wherever I might wherever I am all
55:13 right well how would you do it what
55:15 would it be
55:16 and we start talking you know like well
55:18 you know I guess the best thing you'd be
55:19 like an implant in your head and you
55:22 could just listen to order maybe some
55:23 really light earbud that you know let
55:25 you hear the outside world just as much
55:27 as you would normally hear it but when
55:28 your music turns on it balances between
55:31 music and the outside hearing like kind
55:32 of hearing aids that you don't need all
55:35 right well I should go research that see
55:37 if anyone's ever made it sometimes what
55:40 you can do
55:42 and there was a this really good example
55:44 of this sort of alternate technique I'm
55:47 talking about if you can't be the exact
55:49 thing that you want to be for whatever
55:51 physical mental reason or time reason or
55:53 whatever Jeff Bridges made a movie back
55:57 in the 80s called Tucker and was about a
56:00 car that was invented by this
56:02 independent car manufacturer I think in
56:04 the 30s and his wife like Franklin
56:08 Tucker I don't remember his first name
56:10 but of something Tucker and the car was
56:12 super innovative it had cool things like
56:16 if you turn the steering wheel the
56:17 lights actually pointed in the direction
56:19 of the steering of the tires so you
56:21 always had the light where you were
56:22 headed so you wouldn't I don't know
56:26 wreck into something right it had a lot
56:29 of cool design principles and his
56:33 problem was just like DeLorean you can't
56:35 mess with the top three at that time in
56:36 America because they'll crush you
56:38 they'll kill you they'll frame you for
56:39 cocaine possession all kinds of stuff
56:41 right and so in the movie there's a
56:45 classic scene and this happened with
56:48 with Ralph Bakshi and I'll say that
56:52 story to someone the movie shows up
56:55 walks inside the Tucker
56:58 manufacturing line and he says you know
57:01 I want to work for you and you know it's
57:05 Hollywood so you know who knows how the
57:07 real conversation went but I could tell
57:10 you what from Ralph Bakshi's it's
57:11 similar but the Tucker character goes
57:13 what do you mean and he says I've seen
57:16 your car it's phenomenal
57:18 I know how to build cars and I want to I
57:20 don't care what I have to do I'm gonna
57:23 be involved with this Tucker car because
57:24 I think it's gonna blow up
57:25 I think its innovative it's exactly what
57:27 I've personally been waiting for it
57:29 remember the old analogy I just gave you
57:30 asking somebody hey how do you make this
57:34 better what succored already figured it
57:35 out but the guy wanted to help the
57:36 engineering get all these complexities
57:38 worked out and he ends up being a part
57:40 of the company now the unfortunate
57:44 eventual history of Tucker was that he
57:46 was shut down and no one ever bought his
57:47 designs and ever did anything with them
57:49 unfortunately you might learn to those
57:51 two but believe me you'll love the
57:53 journey along
57:54 way the ralph bakshi if you listen to
57:56 the the narration on top of the movie
57:59 Wizards I've talked about this movie a
58:02 couple times in episodes and outlined
58:03 everything I've even outlined this
58:04 particular example but we're here now so
58:06 let's do it again
58:08 Roth Bakshi was a prodigy artist in New
58:11 York City and I mean prodigy eventually
58:17 he broke away from the studio who was
58:18 working for which I think was Warner
58:21 Brothers but I can't remember I think
58:23 Warner Brothers is in Chicago or
58:25 something but he wasn't I think of
58:26 Brooklyn New York even but he breaks out
58:30 makes his own studio he starts making
58:31 little films for it's the cat heavy
58:34 metal or not heavy metal he makes heavy
58:39 traffic excuse me
58:40 heavy traffic hate making mistakes and
58:41 episodes sucks babies heavy traffic and
58:45 then he makes his movie wizards and
58:48 wizards is about good versus evil it's
58:50 an amazing film that got him all of his
58:52 gigs with the JR Tolkien franchise
58:54 because Jarrett Oakland's daughter saw
58:56 wizards and said oh my god for the very
58:58 first time I'm gonna go to my father and
58:59 say there is an artist that is alive
59:01 that can handle your book and if it
59:04 weren't for him you wouldn't have Lord
59:05 of the Rings The Hobbit out of the 70s
59:07 and I think early 80s but this artist
59:10 this woman walks into the studio because
59:14 it was sort of back in the 70s where
59:16 things were kind of open you could walk
59:17 into animation studios or any business
59:19 that's independent and you know hang out
59:21 and learn what's going on and this woman
59:24 and I forget her name she says you know
59:28 I really want to help make this help
59:31 make movies with you I'm gonna become an
59:32 animator now the way he tells the story
59:35 I believe is that she really didn't have
59:39 an art background isn't that crazy
59:43 she just had a pure desire and she felt
59:45 it in her heart this is something she
59:48 needs to go for and a lot of you if not
59:51 all of you have this moment okay I want
59:54 you to listen to the moment I want you
59:55 to take action because of that moment
59:57 right so he's like okay
60:01 what does ralph do as a logistics guy
60:05 he's the director he's the writer and
60:08 this ain't his first rodeo
60:10 I can tell you have been in his position
60:13 several times you'd never want to create
60:17 a dependency with a resource that might
60:20 fail and eventually it impacts the
60:23 overall schedule of the project in my
60:26 game company I had a kid he really
60:27 wanted to draw Marvel characters for one
60:29 of our games and so I looked at the
60:32 schedule and I said look we won't need
60:34 this art for another month or two so
60:37 while I don't need this to work why
60:40 don't you take a stab at it
60:42 he took a stab at it and he completely
60:45 and utterly failed but then I came in
60:47 and drew it instead I did want to but
60:51 that's just what had to happen but I
60:54 didn't injure the project so what Ralph
60:55 did was he said look we have a lot of
60:58 demons in this movie they're goofy
61:02 they're not terribly serious but they're
61:04 kind of goofy-looking squashy weird
61:08 characters and he said why don't you
61:10 start designing demons cuz we don't need
61:13 him just yet and she said okay and she
61:18 starts drawing demons and she nails the
61:21 style guide meaning she nails the
61:23 goofiness and the comedy that was built
61:25 into them because they're kind of stupid
61:26 OFI things and her demons are the ones
61:31 that are in the movie and she drew a
61:32 bunch of them ton of them and he said
61:34 this girl turned into one of the best
61:36 animators I had she was quick she was
61:38 accurate and she captured the vision
61:40 that was in my brain that I told her
61:42 that I wanted her to draw I don't know
61:46 where she went into her career but I
61:48 guarantee you if she quit it was on her
61:50 own schedule she decided to quit because
61:53 she had the skills to make it happen an
61:56 animation kept going until jeez a canned
61:58 animation was still popular clear up
62:01 until the 21st century right there are
62:04 thousands upon tens of thousands of
62:08 stories just like that all around the
62:10 world
62:11 if you don't know him that doesn't mean
62:14 they didn't exist and they didn't happen
62:16 and what does that mean to you huh
62:19 that means that you can do it 200
62:23 percent now I did an episode in season 1
62:26 called time management alright for those
62:30 of you who are listening to me and your
62:32 I've interested but this is little devil
62:36 on your shoulder and it's saying to you
62:38 yeah you know you know he's right but
62:42 you don't have enough time to do this
62:45 kind of stuff look at your life there's
62:47 no time you got kids you got a husband
62:49 you got a wife you got a job
62:51 your jobs intense there's no way you can
62:54 do any of this stuff that's a lie and
62:57 you need to go watch my episode on time
63:00 management
63:01 it sounds sterile it sounds on exciting
63:04 but here's what the time management
63:05 episode is really about it is about all
63:10 those little microseconds that you have
63:12 to yourself in life today because the
63:15 cellphones think about how much social
63:17 media crap you you view you post you
63:21 respond to and in the end it's a ton of
63:28 time throughout a week and you might
63:31 think yeah well I need that time to be
63:33 my time and nothing serious because I
63:36 need that break from my tension in life
63:39 and you're right you're right believe me
63:43 I do it too I have a couple times a day
63:46 that I unwind honestly these episodes
63:49 are the first thing I do when I wake up
63:51 right I've been up half an hour before I
63:54 did this episode right I look up with no
63:57 clue about what I'm gonna do
63:59 I just set it up and it comes to me boom
64:04 some of it sometimes is very evident
64:06 that's what I'm doing right the time
64:08 management is all about sitting on the
64:10 pot driving in your car having a break
64:14 when the kids finally go to bed all
64:16 those little tiny pockets where you can
64:19 pull out something that you're
64:21 interested in
64:23 film writing is very interesting because
64:25 it's a good archetype for how to get
64:27 into something when you don't think you
64:28 have a lot of time the novice writer
64:33 which I had been for 20 years before I
64:36 finally got trained became sort of a
64:38 semi-professional write is you spending
64:42 a couple years thinking about a script
64:46 taking notes go see my all my episodes
64:50 on screenwriting if you're interested
64:51 interested in that I'll share all my
64:52 secrets with you the coveted stuff that
64:55 nobody shares because they don't want
64:56 anyone else to be in the industry but
64:58 then after a couple years you will have
65:01 your script completely figured out top
65:03 to bottom front to back all your acts
65:05 all figured out their climax is your
65:07 twists your character development why
65:09 people are doing things in your script
65:10 and at that point you get out and
65:14 double-click your screenplay writing
65:16 software that is when you start running
65:19 your action your so your scene setups
65:22 your action your settings your dialogue
65:24 and it just falls out of you right
65:27 you're gonna rewrite the crap out of it
65:28 after you're done because until you see
65:30 it all together you won't know about
65:31 other problems you're gonna have got an
65:33 episode on that too
65:34 but take that analogy for you having
65:37 very limited time to engage the dream
65:39 that's in your head right now research
65:41 this thing you want to do when you don't
65:44 have the time to be a full time
65:45 committed person to it like for me no
65:48 electronics what ended up happening with
65:50 me is that I said okay I need to start
65:52 just re-freshing my mind in upgrading my
65:57 knowledge because electronic says
65:58 advanced since last time I was deeply
66:00 into it and I've never been as deeply
66:02 into it as I am today so yeah I'll be on
66:06 Wikipedia I will have to look up a bunch
66:09 of acronyms companies don't agree on
66:10 what to call certain things and so one
66:12 company calls it one thing and you know
66:15 in the manuals it's actually got an
66:17 acronym that's different but you go to
66:18 the other company makes the same chip
66:20 and they have a different acronym they
66:22 mean the same exact thing so you're
66:24 gonna have to update your brain with all
66:26 the referential information that you
66:28 need to know so you can read a schematic
66:30 anywhere in the world and go oh I see
66:31 you're using Texas Instruments
66:33 methodology of referencing is opposed to
66:35 adafruit's method right
66:36 and the ultimate secret of it all of any
66:41 one of the projects that you guys might
66:42 have in your brain is it's all easy it
66:48 is you just need to know where to apply
66:51 these easy steps to get what you want
66:55 out of life to get what you need into
66:56 your projects get to the next level the
66:58 next stage the next step right
67:00 break your project down into little tiny
67:02 steps that look even easier than the
67:08 next step you know it'll all accumulate
67:11 into something real and even if at the
67:13 end you create a big snowball of kind of
67:18 crap you know like what if I my project
67:21 I've got this huge pile of circuitry and
67:23 pile of stuff that it just looks
67:25 Frankenstein II in it but it kind of
67:27 does what I needed to do but it's not
67:28 going to be marketable the product costs
67:30 like eight hundred dollars because I've
67:32 used a bunch of expensive parts but at
67:34 that point I can start simplifying
67:35 everything well that doesn't need to be
67:38 that big I don't be using breadboards I
67:40 should have breakout boards and you know
67:42 make this thing a more integrated I
67:44 could take all these things and maybe
67:45 find a company to make me a chip that
67:47 does all this or maybe I could find one
67:49 that's already created to consolidate a
67:51 bunch of that stuff down to a teeny tiny
67:53 dot you know goes from costing $100 to
67:58 costing $3.00 instead of running on five
68:02 volts it runs on one volt saving myself
68:05 you know the power consumption so that I
68:08 can tell my my people that might be
68:10 interested in buying one when I'm doing
68:13 hey this thing barely cute you know uses
68:16 to to triple-a batteries right I mean is
68:20 it really hard to dip a paint brush and
68:23 paint and put it on a surface no that's
68:27 pretty easy you just gotta figure out
68:29 where it goes and obviously the Devils
68:33 are always in the details the hard stuff
68:36 is in making it look easy but that's why
68:41 you have time to figure it out
68:43 my buddy Sydney he paints photographs I
68:47 mean he doesn't look at a photograph in
68:49 painting he paints things out of his
68:51 brain that are futuristic designs that
68:54 look like photographs I mean his command
68:55 of light is godly and one time before I
69:00 really met him I thought man I'm gonna
69:01 try to paint something like this and I
69:03 got a big canvas and I tried to paint a
69:04 futuristic city scene I eventually gave
69:09 up shouldn't have but I did I painted a
69:12 dolphin on top of it instead and what I
69:17 realized when I met Syd and I started
69:19 watching him go through his process he
69:20 draws a thousand to three thousand
69:22 sketches of what are you gonna put on
69:24 that canvas and then he gets a little
69:25 teeny tiny canvas about this big I'm
69:28 holding up my hands about a 10 inch
69:30 diameter square and he paints a little
69:34 tiny version of it first gets the light
69:36 down in his brain because hey a smaller
69:39 canvas can only accept a limited amount
69:41 of paint it's very easy to correct what
69:43 you're doing you can paint over the
69:45 whole thing in a matter of minutes
69:46 instead of hours and days I once he gets
69:49 the little tiny thumbnail painting done
69:52 he does the big one and just uses it his
69:55 little one as a color guide he also
69:57 mixes all of his paints for the little
70:00 one and he keeps them in containers so
70:02 they don't dry out and when he hits the
70:05 big one he's got all of his paints
70:06 already figured out right he broke it
70:09 down to little steps this is how Art
70:11 Center in Pasadena will teach you how to
70:13 draw they also teach you the mechanism
70:15 to have an assembly line of your work
70:18 right if you're working on Monday on
70:21 project a the entire time you're working
70:23 on project a for money through Friday
70:26 with the deadline on Friday you're
70:29 thinking about project B in your brain
70:30 the whole time how you gonna do project
70:32 B that's next week
70:34 pretty an assembly line in your brain
70:37 making you more of a multitasker right
70:39 for those of you have the desire and you
70:42 have this void in you that needs to get
70:45 filled
70:46 get yourself a project get yourself a
70:50 project don't worry about what you've
70:51 done in the past it doesn't matter the
70:53 past is the past you live in the now
70:56 don't brag to me about what you've done
70:58 in the past I don't give a [ __ ] tell me
71:01 what you're doing right now get back
71:03 into it have faith in yourself because
71:06 the universe does and again you're never
71:08 alone the universe is always there if
71:10 you invest in yourself the universe will
71:13 invest in you again you can't get the
71:16 guitar solo out of the ether of the
71:17 universe if you don't buy the guitar and
71:19 practice you think about it all you want
71:22 I could just imagine myself getting
71:25 onstage and tearing up the guitar or
71:26 whatever it is right white ain't never
71:29 gonna happen if you don't buy the guitar
71:30 all right it's like the old joke about
71:32 the blonde that keeps asking God every
71:35 single night to help her win the lottery
71:37 she prays and praise and praise
71:40 eventually God puts his head down into
71:45 her room when she's praying at her bed
71:47 side and he says buy a ticket right you
71:52 gotta buy the ticket people get yourself
71:54 in the game there are no rules when
71:56 you're by yourself right you run your
71:59 show you can go slow you can go fast as
72:01 long as some progress is happening
72:02 inside your brain you're on your way so
72:07 get out and do it any of you've
72:09 experienced this share it in the
72:10 comments please if you have been a deep
72:13 thoughts radio calm please go there's
72:15 audio video a locked Facebook group and
72:18 patreon take care of yourself in someone
72:22 else then I'll see in the next deep
72:23 thoughts
