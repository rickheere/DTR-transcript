00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen's of
00:36 deep thoughts on this 60-degree evening
00:40 was 83 degrees today not 60 and dropping
00:44 which is kind of funny when worries
00:46 about the global warming horseshit and
00:50 here we are swinging 25 degrees in one
00:52 day and hey I'm still alive unbelievable
00:55 we've had a suggestion I think is
00:57 amazing perfect when I started diving
01:01 into the suggestion some things occurred
01:05 to me and has to do with Anarchy more
01:10 specifically and our key ISM and then
01:14 you know I started looking into it and
01:16 you know it's obviously a lot of the
01:19 documentation on the concept is it's
01:21 always been sort of this far-left
01:23 strategy very interesting where are we
01:26 today we're in a far left who plod
01:30 magnified mass media a bunch of
01:35 horseshit
01:36 I'm not gonna try to cuss this bunch in
01:40 this episode but well that little one go
01:42 through there's this whole theory of
01:45 order and chaos in the universe order
01:48 out of chaos problem reaction solution
01:50 is how David Icke says it which is
01:52 brilliant paraphrase it's worth
01:55 repeating and so some people maybe up in
01:58 some high philosophical frame of mind
02:01 might say well it's good to have all
02:02 these kids burning down their own
02:03 universities and punching all the ladies
02:06 in the face because they like the
02:07 President of the United States I think
02:10 most of us are tired that but then it
02:12 occurred to me why was doing research on
02:14 this just some of the basic definitions
02:16 you know just reading sort of it's just
02:18 so I'm not missing some giant arc of
02:21 what you know formalized anarchy is all
02:25 about and what is the other big left
02:28 agenda that we always hear about
02:29 socialism / globalism hmm the complete
02:35 opposite definition of Anarchy Anarchy's
02:38 traditional definition is about
02:40 essentially disembowelling your
02:43 government from having any
02:45 over you and then you live in little
02:47 pockets where you kind of manage your
02:49 own territory I'm sort of pulling back
02:51 from government saying you know it was a
02:52 good idea we tried it but man you guys
02:55 [ __ ] up everything so it's interesting
02:57 how an individual can endorse perhaps
03:01 Anarchy behavior and of course I know
03:03 what they're gonna say I'm just against
03:04 you man and then the other side we have
03:07 this total utter dependency on socialism
03:11 on the government excuse me called
03:12 socialism now what happens when your
03:17 body atrophies you essentially for a
03:20 little while at least lose the ability
03:22 to use that part of your body if you
03:25 have your arm in a cast for a long time
03:27 and your leg in a cast for a long time
03:29 at your fees a little bit and as soon as
03:31 you get it cut off you have to teach
03:33 your muscles again how to list stand up
03:35 how to move your arms how to hold
03:37 something if you are a bodybuilder
03:39 you'll definitely notice that you know
03:41 when your arms is weaker than the other
03:42 and you gotta work that one out a little
03:43 bit more and be careful about it go
03:45 slowly right well socialism would be
03:48 like having a cast on your whole body
03:50 and your whole mind and your whole soul
03:52 and your ability to sustain yourself and
03:56 you always have to have the cast of
03:58 government around you to hold you up to
04:00 feed you to supply you with what you
04:02 need and if it ever failed you and you
04:08 had to cut the cast off because your
04:10 government plummets someone takes over
04:12 your government they bomb your
04:13 government and you're left all the
04:16 sudden standing there with no knowledge
04:19 if we're gonna get your next meal who's
04:21 gonna keep the electric plants on
04:23 anything terrifying isn't it
04:27 can you imagine down to your soul you
04:30 wouldn't even know how to worship God
04:34 because it would most likely be
04:36 forbidden the only God you would be
04:38 allowed to know it would be your
04:39 government and if it died what happens
04:43 in so usually the question about Anarchy
04:46 comes up and it's it's do you endorse it
04:49 do you believe it has a time to be used
04:52 in the universe to fight something
04:56 and that's about like asking and the
05:01 suggesting the person who suggested SEPA
05:03 so did not ask that question but that's
05:04 what usually happens it's like asking
05:07 you know what is your opinion about
05:09 abortion you know you ask a male about
05:12 abortion okay
05:14 the male gender will never have one so
05:20 how strong did their opinion be it's
05:22 about then the concept of life and
05:24 whether or not it should be capably
05:26 being terminated because of certain
05:28 circumstances for a woman it's extremely
05:33 personal as a part of their body they
05:35 are carrying it they're caring for it
05:38 very personal now some women let's just
05:42 be honest and some men let's just be
05:45 honest they don't care about you know
05:48 being pregnant and of course someone
05:51 with 50 kids it's a little bit of a
05:53 different opinion but first-timers
05:55 sometimes they just go oh man you know
05:57 we're gonna have a kid oh my god Wow
05:59 whatever you know it's rare but it
06:03 happens
06:04 within our ki you have a very polarizing
06:06 situation where you're like okay same
06:09 with abortion or we're gonna have to
06:10 really look at all the facts here well
06:12 how did you get pregnant what's the
06:13 problem here why do you have to do that
06:14 what do you feel like you have to do
06:15 that same thing happens with anarchy why
06:19 do you think you need to do that what I
06:22 think about just absolute George Soros
06:26 funded Craigslist [ __ ] showing up
06:30 for protests going in to the Supreme
06:32 Court hearing and then walking out to a
06:34 tree and getting a bundle of money out
06:36 of an envelope awesome
06:37 you know tofu eaten douche bag is Pat
06:41 just passing out the cash yeah I I don't
06:43 have any sympathy for that [ __ ] I don't
06:46 have any I don't believe in that
06:48 it's orchestrated infiltration and
06:53 treason against the country anyone taken
06:57 a check from straw Soros to protest in
07:00 this country should be charged for
07:01 treason and sent the [ __ ] out of this
07:04 country they just should in my opinion
07:07 but then again if I was President Trump
07:09 George Soros would be either dead or
07:11 locked away so hardcore that you'd never
07:15 see him again it's serious business
07:19 infiltrating a country but we have
07:21 militiamen right we have the Minutemen
07:23 movement here in America where a bunch
07:25 of guys are like look I'm all about
07:27 common law I'm all about the
07:29 Constitution of the United States and I
07:30 support the Republic I'm not a
07:32 Republican I'm not a Democrat
07:33 I want sovereignty for mankind and when
07:36 freedom of speech and want the right to
07:38 bear arms so I could protect the freedom
07:39 of speech I don't wanna be YZ dropped on
07:41 I don't want to have to house swords
07:42 soldiers etc down the line we tend in
07:47 the truth movement which has got a bunch
07:49 of weird fragmentations now just like
07:52 the Catholic religion we tend to support
07:54 the Minutemen because they kind of sound
07:57 exactly like a soldier that's been sworn
07:59 into the military and we sure as hell
08:02 support them they want to give their
08:03 life for the country
08:05 hmm but are they considered anarchists
08:09 at times
08:10 let me parse what I think is the
08:13 difference this is my opinion I've never
08:15 been in our kissed I don't know any your
08:18 Minutemen stand firm and stand their
08:20 ground and they simply say this is
08:23 America and it's a concept it's an idea
08:27 America could be anywhere in the world
08:29 as long as you had the idea to have it
08:31 yes it is cannibalized from great
08:34 efforts like Magna Carta which was
08:36 completely compromised before five
08:39 hundred years was up but America has
08:41 done pretty good with this experiment
08:43 that revitalized Magna Carta simplify it
08:46 and instantiate it and keep it going now
08:49 of course there's been allusions of
08:50 freedom and depending on what metric
08:53 you're parsing there's still our
08:54 illusions of freedom in this country but
08:56 there's a change coming right change is
09:00 happening right now what you don't find
09:02 is someone's speaking their mind
09:06 engaging the First Amendment and
09:08 Minutemen show up to be [ __ ] that
09:11 doesn't happen they said never heard it
09:13 happen
09:14 I mean someone could say that they
09:17 believe in socialism and they believe in
09:20 abortion is just an absolute method of
09:23 casual birth control then these people
09:26 don't show up but let them have their
09:28 opinion and they pretty much say well I
09:32 don't think that opinion is widely
09:35 received you're more than welcome to
09:36 give your opinion the Minutemen will
09:40 show up when people will in various
09:43 federal agencies would siege people's
09:46 properties try to destroy a farmer's
09:49 land or something or there's all kinds
09:51 of cases out there some Senator Reid
09:54 wants to sell land to the Chinese to
09:56 build a big solar panel panel farm and
09:59 he cites some turtle in the desert to
10:02 keep out other people from occupying the
10:06 land so he can seize it as eminent
10:07 domain and sell it to China he fails and
10:10 they beat the [ __ ] out of him go look up
10:12 those pictures his face all bashed in
10:14 believe me that's because he failed but
10:17 the the Provocateur Milo who I have so
10:23 far amazing respect for extremely
10:28 intelligent human being you know yes we
10:32 should probably say goes if he was
10:33 sitting right here next to me let you
10:35 know you know he's he's a gay Jewish guy
10:37 he married his partner there's a black
10:40 man so he is absolutely the most I think
10:43 he's one of the most in touch people to
10:47 the human condition that we have today
10:49 he tried to speak at Berkeley University
10:51 and anarchists showed up of course super
10:56 tough with their you know bend Anna's
10:58 across their face because they don't
11:00 want to be identified hell they may not
11:02 be from this country in some cases they
11:05 could be you know bad cops or bad
11:07 intelligence officers hiding in this
11:09 stuff but most of them are just punk
11:10 kids swinging their skateboards and all
11:12 kinds of other [ __ ] cuz they wish they
11:14 had a life but that's an anarchist they
11:16 show up to [ __ ] start right doing
11:21 horrible with my swearing Richmond
11:22 tonight but is there a time when that
11:24 should happen I recently mentioned the
11:27 movie Total Recall for a completely
11:28 different reason but in that movie there
11:31 was an anarchist sort of resistance in
11:35 the Moot in the planet Mars
11:36 where the guy that ran the place the
11:38 mining agency dude was really starting
11:42 to treat everyone really badly and so
11:45 they were trying to resist the
11:46 corporation and kind of you know blow up
11:49 facilities and make it hard for him so
11:50 you'd have to complete and give into
11:53 normal conditions human rights
11:56 conditions right it didn't really work
11:59 at all and it was resolved in the end
12:01 not because of them but because of
12:03 Arnold Schwarzenegger's character I
12:05 guess they contributed but anarchy in
12:08 its pure form I don't think works
12:12 because it's not organized that doesn't
12:15 have demands it doesn't try to be
12:17 diplomatic in any way shape or form it
12:20 doesn't attempt to necessarily inform
12:22 the citizenship of the problem when you
12:25 inform the citizens this opossum walks
12:28 by me back here you see it right there
12:29 yeah those are you listenin iPad ipods
12:33 you're missing out here but simply
12:36 disrupting things will get you I think
12:39 temporary change because they're only
12:41 responding to the moment let's give you
12:45 give an example government wants to
12:48 seize a bunch of land that is
12:50 traditionally Native American reserves
12:52 because there's a either oil underneath
12:55 it or they need to run an oil pipe over
12:57 okay well you're more of your Minutemen
13:00 kind of people showed up for that for
13:02 sure big ass brawls horrible situation
13:05 but it was not anarchists okay and so
13:11 they they had a problem they needed the
13:13 entire country of America to understand
13:16 what was going on they needed the word
13:18 to spread hey guys this is going on and
13:20 they've spilt oil and all kinds of crazy
13:22 stuff on our land and and polluted it
13:25 I'm sure maybe there's a little bit of
13:28 exaggeration here and there on their end
13:30 but overall we know we didn't you know
13:32 we got to be careful with just running
13:35 big giant ugly pipes through areas of
13:38 untouched forests and and wildlife areas
13:43 it'll disrupt the animals that'll screw
13:45 things up and we just got to be careful
13:47 an anarchy thing
13:50 it's like the protests that are going on
13:52 now before the midterms random pockets
13:55 of the world exploding with these little
13:58 tiny protests that you know draw blood
14:02 people getting bludgeoned in the face
14:04 and these cowardice cowardice [ __ ] men
14:08 hit and chicks in the face who are
14:12 simply peacefully attending speeches
14:17 attending rallies and just representing
14:20 themselves not being belligerent or you
14:22 know screaming anyone's face which is
14:24 assault right threatening someone's
14:27 safety you know they had the ethic girl
14:31 from what I think was San Francisco some
14:33 that actually punched a guy in the face
14:35 and he turned around and absolutely
14:37 knocked her out well you know you want
14:42 to play that game then you're gonna play
14:44 that game right a chick doesn't normally
14:47 go into a bar you know tap a guy on the
14:51 shoulder and spin him around when she's
14:53 a hundred and thirty pounds and punch a
14:55 guy in the face he's 220 as a
14:57 construction worker you know maybe a big
14:59 big chick can do that
15:01 go to a 5/8 guy knock him out or
15:03 whatever there's plenty of women they
15:05 can do that but you know in these
15:06 protests these women lose their [ __ ]
15:08 minds
15:08 even these little kids do these little
15:11 boys right but they all kind of team up
15:14 like hyenas you know and they again
15:17 there you got the teacher the professor
15:19 that swung a [ __ ] padlock on the end
15:23 of a chain at somebody's head that's
15:26 like a lethal weapon you could kill
15:29 someone in a second with that and a
15:31 professor who can't think for himself
15:34 he's a memorizing or Peter he's a
15:36 complete [ __ ] coward that didn't go
15:37 in the real world and get a job that
15:40 particular guy is definitely one of
15:41 those guys and so he has no perception
15:45 of reality he doesn't know what it's
15:46 like to have to earn a paycheck he
15:48 doesn't know what it's like to start a
15:49 corporation have to pay the dues and
15:51 hold your meetings and take care of
15:53 employees and buy health care and all
15:55 that kind of stuff no clue he's living
15:58 on the dole he's literally living in a
15:59 subculture of socialism called the
16:02 educational system
16:03 I can't be fired right it's his ten year
16:06 mark he can molest every girl in this
16:08 class and he's just gonna get shifted
16:09 around to different universities that's
16:11 why I gotta make changes in this stuff
16:13 but let's say an anarchist creates a big
16:15 stink horrible stink well the government
16:20 or people responsible for the protests
16:22 meaning not the ones that pay them like
16:24 George Soros but the ones that they're
16:26 against simply look at this as a flash
16:29 on the pants no one's being educated
16:31 just the people that think they're
16:33 educated have shown up and and they've
16:35 created this big problem so they calmed
16:37 down everything then they'll swing out
16:40 to neutralize those people look them up
16:42 threaten them with lawsuits whatever or
16:45 they'll just figure out what triggered
16:47 them what made them pay attention to us
16:49 such that they came here was sort of an
16:51 impression of what we do
16:53 maybe they completely know I don't know
16:55 well let's not do that let's change
16:58 let's let's adjust the language of what
17:00 this means and then they won't notice
17:03 we'll move it offshore we'll close that
17:07 one building that they think it's all
17:08 occurring in and we'll open ten more
17:10 where they can't find him up in the
17:12 hills somewhere boom problem solved the
17:17 Russell Brand was asked when he wrote
17:20 his revolution book whether or not you
17:23 know protesting and holding up signs
17:24 actually helped things and even though I
17:27 don't agree with a lot of things that he
17:29 believes I still respect him very very
17:31 much he's a incredibly intelligent human
17:34 being let me tell you it is strange how
17:36 we can be fascinated by someone's
17:40 intelligence and then we're completely
17:41 different people
17:42 you know but he said he didn't think
17:44 that that actually worked anymore
17:45 holding up signs and I have to agree
17:49 there are some strike going on in
17:51 California right now I think I'm
17:52 Marriott or something like that
17:54 I hope I don't have that wrong that's
17:55 like subsidiary hotels and motels that
17:57 they own I was in San Jose recently and
18:01 there were some protesters standing on a
18:03 quarter very peaceful got their signs
18:05 out there
18:05 poor guys their union is putting them on
18:08 strike and usually the only reason why
18:11 those union settlements ever resolved is
18:15 because one are signed up to the Union
18:17 and - they need their workers to come
18:20 back to work but it's not because
18:23 someone stood outside with signs and
18:25 embarrassed the hotel they don't care
18:27 about that they don't care about that at
18:30 all what makes the public support any
18:33 sort of protests education what is the
18:38 issue here we're trying to deal with
18:40 named something what I find with most
18:46 Anarchy of the 21st century that I have
18:49 seen so far and it's only American and
18:51 it's very light okay is that you're not
18:54 dealing with people that really want to
18:56 have a three-dimensional understanding
18:58 of a concept
18:59 anyone who's for socialism I think has a
19:02 very short attention span there people
19:05 that fail at chess because they can't
19:07 think it through you sit down an average
19:10 kid about socialism and you say why do
19:12 you like socialism and they'll say well
19:13 because I think well should be
19:14 distributed there shouldn't meeting one
19:16 that has something that I don't have
19:19 well let's just put aside all those
19:23 those families that gave their kids all
19:25 the money in the world yeah there's
19:27 quite a few of them in Southern
19:29 California but world population wise
19:30 it's an infinitesimal percent of an
19:33 infinitesimal percent so the rest of the
19:35 people that I know that are filthy rich
19:37 earned it
19:38 they wouldn't get educated a lot of them
19:40 from really bad you know financial
19:44 districts they do they weren't rich at
19:46 all they invent something they work hard
19:48 they saved whatever they have they have
19:50 it because they worked really really
19:51 hard but now as we always say on the
19:54 show the education system in this world
19:56 at least in the United States has been
19:57 destroyed utterly destroyed we have bad
20:01 left brain education that don't yield
20:04 jobs we've lost the arts so creativity
20:08 is that all-time low in this country hmm
20:11 it's so funny if we were to bring back
20:13 the Pharaohs from Egypt and say this is
20:16 America today what do you think's wrong
20:17 with this place they go well where's
20:19 your art where's your creativity where's
20:21 the right brain and then they just go we
20:24 say oh we got rid of it and they say
20:25 well that's your problem you idiots
20:27 you're you are a left brain right brain
20:30 thing
20:31 if you don't nurture both sides of your
20:33 brain it'd be like walking around with a
20:35 big giant left arm and a tiny puny right
20:37 arm well I think most of us if we woke
20:39 up with a Popeye left arm and olive oil
20:41 right arm we go see a doctor real fast
20:44 and probably go to the gym now what
20:46 happens if America were to have elected
20:49 Hillary Clinton and the overall cabal a
20:53 sixteen year plan to destroy this
20:54 country had completed all the favours
20:58 and all of the current criminals that
21:00 are touching kids and killing kids are
21:02 all hidden and exonerated and promoted
21:06 who knows what her list of of favors
21:10 were but it was like Satan incarnate
21:12 okay
21:13 if you think I'm joking I ain't joking
21:16 okay we dodged a bullet of unbelievable
21:20 portions and and we proportions and we
21:23 are still in like the matrix you know
21:27 back pedal thing so those bullets are
21:29 still common and we're all doing the big
21:32 lean back right now we haven't quite
21:33 upright at our body and we haven't
21:35 destroyed the enemy just yet but at
21:37 least we know who they are we know they
21:38 maneuver and we have for the for the
21:41 time being we have learned how to dodge
21:42 their bullets okay they may have
21:45 something else in planned right but what
21:49 if we were completely taken over
21:51 alternate universe she won we would have
21:55 problems I think and we would probably
21:58 have problems at a level where we have
22:01 to make some pretty big decisions about
22:04 what we're gonna do with our life right
22:07 now I've said on episodes a couple
22:10 seasons back that I definitely have
22:12 close friends of mine that have said to
22:16 me stupid things like well as long as
22:19 you get yours it's okay meaning they'll
22:25 join the negative side the dark side and
22:28 sell out their country and sell out
22:30 everything they'll sell out their
22:31 [ __ ] kids future just as long as they
22:35 get a little paycheck and live a
22:36 slightly better life before they die I
22:39 should think those people didn't exist
22:41 in any level of bulk and when I had
22:43 friends telling me to my face who
22:46 otherwise represent themselves to
22:49 everyone else is extremely patriotic I
22:51 was [ __ ] shocked I'm just gonna put a
22:54 pond around now because I was shocked
22:56 very disappointing
22:58 perhaps the person did not mean what
23:01 they were saying the way I took it I
23:03 don't believe that sort of compromise
23:05 should be made or allowed at any level
23:07 ever consciously you may do it in come
23:11 on consciously or you may be put in a
23:13 really impossible situation and you have
23:15 two bad scenarios that you can resolve
23:18 the situation with and you simply pick
23:19 the lesser one with a paycheck you know
23:22 you know it happens all the time when
23:24 you get wrongfully terminated you can
23:26 either go fight it in court and you know
23:28 lose your life for 10 years you take a
23:30 little severance check and you go home
23:32 and you find a better company okay
23:35 that's probably one I could stomach
23:37 right but if you woke up and this place
23:41 was being run by agencies in Europe and
23:45 I mean completely they decide what what
23:47 chemicals we have to inject in our
23:49 children and in ourselves they decide
23:51 what we can see on TV they decide what
23:54 educational books we have and a lot of
23:56 this has been occurring for 40 years 50
23:58 years so I understand some of you are
24:00 yelling at me if you read our Charlotte
24:02 is there be stuff well at some point the
24:06 human spirit which is born from freedom
24:09 and truth rises up and it will not take
24:14 a certain level of repression but I will
24:21 say that unfortunately I do believe that
24:24 there are cultures out there that are
24:26 very docile either way through
24:28 indoctrination of the mind malnutrition
24:31 food supplies bad medicine or all the
24:34 above and they're still trying to get
24:38 through that stage so they can rise up
24:39 and engage freedoms that we all deserve
24:43 freedoms as defined by the Republic but
24:47 what if we did wake up and everything
24:48 was absolutely aesthetically strange and
24:51 we look at each other a few people on
24:53 the Block that you live on you're like
24:56 I just had to show papers to go to work
24:58 and somebody just roughed up the
25:00 neighbor over there because you didn't
25:04 want the the door-to-door climate
25:06 control person to fondle his wife and
25:10 we're just looking and things have gone
25:11 to [ __ ] robots
25:13 you know cruise the streets with lethal
25:15 weapons you know just in case you might
25:17 move differently and they blow you away
25:19 it gets bad
25:21 the problem with Anarchy in that
25:24 situation is that you can't beat a
25:27 gigantic moving object with a tiny rock
25:33 or stone right
25:35 imagine a semi loaded 18-wheeler it's
25:39 loaded to thumb max
25:40 and it is hauling ass that would be the
25:44 movement that might come around it's a
25:47 negative thing and you're going this
25:50 shouldn't be here
25:51 this shouldn't be moving this should be
25:53 dismantled this shouldn't exist because
25:56 it's rolling over all of our rights and
25:59 some guy goes I know I'll show them
26:01 I'll stand in front of it splat and it's
26:05 gone I'll throw a stone at the
26:08 windshield okay great
26:10 probably won't even care but they might
26:13 drop someone off or have a robot come
26:14 get you and you're gone what you really
26:17 had to offer was enlightenment the again
26:22 obsolete man episode of Twilight Zone
26:25 with burgess meredith he wasn't an
26:28 anarchist
26:29 in the traditional form he had
26:32 definitely thought the government got
26:33 too big it was telling him he couldn't
26:35 read books they were telling him that he
26:40 was obsolete because he was a carpenter
26:41 and there was I guess I don't know
26:43 robots making furniture on what the hell
26:45 the deal was it's obviously a Christ
26:47 homage they told him he had to die but
26:49 he could pick his time of death and his
26:51 method of death and I just said this a
26:53 couple of episodes back so I apologize
26:55 to repeat but it's important here and on
26:57 the national TV system or international
27:01 TV system who knows how big the country
27:02 was there he educated them through an
27:05 example he locked the guy who sentenced
27:08 him to death in the
27:09 with him and said you're gonna die with
27:11 me when the bomb explodes which is in
27:14 this room and the guy panics and tries
27:17 to leave the room on camera it was the
27:20 end of his career Burgess actually let
27:22 him out at the end Burgess died but he
27:25 stood up for what he believed in he read
27:27 the Bible to himself before he died
27:32 teaching the world nobility and strength
27:35 of the personal human spirit hmm what's
27:39 going on right now with a cue movement
27:41 and with I don't know Democrats versus
27:43 Republicans in the United States of
27:44 America on one side you have five out of
27:49 six media organizations on TV all being
27:52 very left last one is the Fox News and
27:56 they sort of play in the middle all the
27:58 newspapers and magazines are all left
28:01 okay all the award shows and about 90%
28:05 of every late-night talk show is all
28:07 left
28:09 hmm sort of disproportionately
28:11 represented on the other side
28:12 they've taken again a microscopic group
28:16 of I think incredibly impressionable
28:18 disappointed disenfranchised people and
28:21 they put a magnifying glass on them as
28:24 if they're gigantic
28:27 and people buy at every single night the
28:31 majority of these centralist stew -
28:33 right not far right but censure - right
28:36 constitutional people in America believe
28:39 that there's this giant gang of people
28:41 they believe if they cross the border to
28:42 California you automatically can't
28:44 determine whether or not someone's a boy
28:45 or girl anymore
28:46 you know because the way everyone looks
28:48 not true we have very focused pockets in
28:53 California that are blue and radical and
28:56 they're tiny okay
28:59 I think moderation is the way we manage
29:01 almost every single facet of our lives
29:03 from the way we eat the way we sleep the
29:05 way we communicate with each other how
29:07 many dirty words I use and I think that
29:10 it's the way that the country should be
29:12 run a little bit of left a little bit
29:15 right a little bit of laws for the
29:16 shorter line people a little bit of laws
29:18 for the inland people methodologies that
29:22 help them survive
29:23 I have never seen in my life what's
29:27 happening today Nora I mean when I say
29:29 I've never seen in my life I've never
29:31 seen it in history I'm sure it's
29:34 happened but I haven't seen it
29:35 documented to any degree which is that
29:38 we have a bunch of people that are being
29:40 lied to
29:41 young people and pressure noble people
29:42 people who are actually suffering due to
29:45 again bad education bad government who
29:48 are going to be I think infinitely
29:50 disappointed with the events that are
29:52 going to occur in the next several years
29:54 they're going to be told they're on the
29:56 winning team and they're gonna lose and
29:58 then they're losing team is gonna
30:00 regroup they're gonna break the law
30:03 they're gonna lie to people right
30:05 misrepresent the truth and they're gonna
30:08 lose again and this is gonna go on year
30:12 after year after year vote after vote
30:14 after vote and I don't know what's gonna
30:17 happen to these people are they gonna
30:19 all commit suicide because whatever they
30:21 try just fails are they gonna come from
30:25 the extreme left and kind of come
30:27 towards the center where most of us
30:28 exist rational thinking people that
30:31 simply go hey I just want my kid to get
30:33 a good education I want you to get a
30:34 good education I want whatever debt you
30:37 owe to a crappy college that give you
30:39 crappy degree I want it erased screw
30:41 those people I don't go bankrupt right
30:43 you don't owe anyone anything for a
30:45 degree that doesn't turn into a job that
30:47 has no prospects of turning into a job I
30:49 support you you don't need socialism to
30:52 fix your problems we just need some
30:53 fairness to happen we need the
30:57 government to endorse it your debts are
31:01 forgiven if you were coaxed into a debt
31:03 that was fraudulent right you know you
31:07 set these people down you just simply go
31:08 okay you're Berkeley protestor nice to
31:11 see you without your your little bandana
31:14 on
31:15 here's never gonna fix your problem what
31:19 would you like to do with your life
31:21 forget politics forget all that [ __ ]
31:23 forget Elizabeth Warren lying that she's
31:26 a Cherokee Indian forget about all that
31:27 stuff what do you want to be what do you
31:31 want to do I'm gonna I'm not gonna tell
31:34 you that it's going to be an overnight
31:35 fix but
31:36 we're gonna get you on the right track
31:37 yes you're gonna have to bust your ass
31:39 but guess what
31:40 you're gonna love the results of working
31:43 hard more than you ever loved sitting on
31:45 your ass or throwing a [ __ ] padlock
31:48 into someone's face right I think that
31:50 guys should go to jail for rest of his
31:52 life quite frankly here's a little
31:54 digression on what they're out there
31:55 I think sucker punching someone in the
31:57 face should be attempted murder just
32:00 like that
32:01 you get caught in a nightclub some guys
32:03 not looking you're a [ __ ] are you drunk
32:05 in your [ __ ] and yes try to you just
32:08 punch them right in the face come around
32:10 behind their head and smack him in the
32:11 ear it's attempted murder and you go to
32:14 jail period and you end up in prison
32:17 that's an anarchy behavior isn't it
32:20 right but if you truly need to affect
32:23 change and that's really the tipping
32:26 point right there's a tipping point in
32:27 the brain of man where they you know
32:30 woman or man doesn't matter where we say
32:33 we got to make a change it's got to
32:35 happen you're gonna have to be quiet and
32:37 pass the education around don't try to
32:41 be the one that gets credit for passing
32:44 the information around that's a stupid
32:46 thing that people do well I told them
32:48 that this was wrong and now they believe
32:49 me and I'm a leader I'm Alex Jones for
32:52 [ __ ] sake right don't do that you know
32:55 write it down on a piece of paper and
32:57 leave it somewhere let someone find it
33:00 so leave it somewhere where they're
33:01 likely to be at the tipping point
33:02 themselves to say yeah you know I work
33:04 at the factory and I come out with no
33:06 coal in my lungs or whatever our burn
33:09 marks and wit marks because my
33:10 government cattle prod
33:13 you know robot tells me what to do and
33:14 you I found this note that says you know
33:17 you know it can be different it's all it
33:20 says life can be different we can you
33:22 can escape this just start infecting the
33:26 mind with the ideas of freedom they're
33:28 naturally spawned for man anyway right
33:31 if the mortal coil itself isn't injured
33:33 into a docile nature through medication
33:35 or bad food or bad water so if anybody
33:40 wanted to know my personal opinion of
33:41 Anarchy I would say I haven't been
33:44 convinced of a single instance where it
33:46 would ever help out it was a tech
33:50 that the bankers used to take over South
33:52 America right you had a good balanced
33:54 country I may be kind of a little bit of
33:56 a dictatorship sort of King kind of
33:58 character again don't give me a bunch of
34:00 [ __ ] about [ __ ] dictators when
34:01 you have a bunch of monarchs still alive
34:04 and running countries in Europe I mean
34:05 give me a break
34:06 if you think dictators are bad then get
34:08 rid of all your monarchs okay get rid of
34:11 them get rid of all the laws to say if
34:12 they touch kids they don't get
34:14 prosecuted no matter what they do
34:16 they're just for you to do whatever they
34:18 want constantly but I haven't seen it
34:22 what are we doing now in 2018 well we
34:26 have a bunch of movements we've had this
34:28 sort of incubating truth movement which
34:31 is now fractured into a bunch of
34:33 opposing forces right so you have truth
34:35 movement for Flat Earth and some people
34:37 hate that we have truth movements for
34:39 the moon missions and 9/11 and all the
34:41 other massacres and crazy stuff that's
34:43 going on they're all segmented people
34:45 care more about one thing than another
34:46 thing okay fine the number one thing
34:49 that we need to focus on I think is
34:51 anything that impedes freedom the
34:53 interesting thing about socialism
34:55 is it probably one of the and I just
34:57 said this the other day one of the
34:59 things that we pride ourselves most on
35:03 is our ability to take care of ourselves
35:06 and socialism is exactly the opposite
35:10 but it's only sold on one stupid Robin
35:13 Hood philosophy which is you see that
35:16 guy who worked really [ __ ] hard he
35:18 worked 80 hours a week for 15 years and
35:21 that's why he owns the Lamborghini and
35:23 the Bentley and he has a beach house
35:24 down there and he's got a beautiful wife
35:26 or she did it and she has a handsome
35:28 husband a bunch of great kids well you
35:31 can have all that we're gonna take it
35:33 from her and so your lazy ass who sits
35:37 there doing whatever you're doing
35:38 marathon and you know a bag of Cheetos
35:41 and Netflix you're gonna have all these
35:45 luxuries because you deserve it because
35:47 you're alive right that's the way they
35:49 sell to morons right
35:53 just blows my mind how idiotic socialism
35:56 is the whole idea of it but then you
35:59 become again you become extremely
36:00 dependent on services provided by your
36:03 country but now let's go back to the
36:06 thing I mentioned the other day story in
36:10 the Bible beautiful story in the Bible
36:12 they wanted Jesus to show up every
36:14 single day and convert you know or
36:17 basically make bread and fish out of
36:20 these baskets infinitely to feed
36:22 everybody a bunch of lazy bastards and
36:26 Jesus was like okay I'll make one round
36:29 but the rest you're gonna do yourself
36:31 I'm gonna teach you how to fish stop
36:33 coming to me to wipe your ass okay throw
36:37 a net learn how it works get yourself
36:40 some fish you'll probably catch a
36:42 hundred times more fish than you can eat
36:44 before they go bad for anyone you find
36:47 it was a big socialist supporter bring
36:50 it up and say well this is one of the
36:52 most brilliant passages that's put it at
36:54 the Bible and with enough Jesus was ever
36:57 real or not doesn't matter that was
36:59 written into the Bible because it is
37:01 actually one of sovereign skill and
37:04 sovereign practice to be independent and
37:06 self-sufficient but now there's another
37:10 behavior by a certain group of people in
37:13 America at least that gets put in the
37:17 anarchist camp which i think is a gross
37:21 exaggeration of what they're doing in a
37:23 false classification of anarchy and
37:25 actually gives sort of a pseudo credence
37:29 to a bunch of really I don't know what
37:33 you want to call them maybe deplorable
37:35 human beings would be good but they are
37:38 middle class kids I don't want to say
37:42 necessarily just white because Seattle
37:44 and Portland produces plenty of them and
37:46 all the races and creeds around the
37:47 world they're native to those areas of
37:50 course but they're rich kids or they're
37:53 well-off enough they don't need to work
37:55 as mommy and daddy's writing them checks
37:57 because they're like please don't remind
37:58 me I'm a horrible parent please don't
38:00 remind me that I don't know anything
38:02 about what I'm doing and and please
38:05 don't embarrass me then
38:06 party by you going to jail or killing
38:09 someone or raping someone or killing
38:11 someone in a DUI accident right here's
38:13 your check
38:14 here's your check here's your check
38:15 these kids don't need to work they're
38:18 not necessarily trust fund babies but
38:20 they're the next thing down right they
38:23 get out there and their game is to say I
38:26 am a loser I know I'm a loser currently
38:30 it's not a permanent condition but
38:32 currently there are losers they
38:35 contribute nothing to life they have
38:37 found absolutely no trade skills
38:38 whatsoever it's a guarantee it is a
38:41 guarantee that every single kid there
38:43 wears these [ __ ] you know bandanas
38:46 across their face hitting innocent
38:48 people for their first right amendment
38:51 right to engage in the First Amendment
38:54 they have no trade skills and I'll tell
38:56 you why we know this a far fact because
39:00 every kid that has a trade skill goes
39:02 off and does that because it's like sex
39:04 and protesting and wasting your time is
39:08 not what a person with talent and a
39:11 trade skill does right if you could fix
39:16 a car that's what you're doing because
39:18 you love it all right if you're I don't
39:22 know whatever the hell you are you do it
39:24 a chick who gets out surf the waves here
39:27 at Huntington Beach and wins the
39:29 championship oh I guarantee she's not at
39:32 some protest somewhere I mean you know
39:34 maybe like I showed up and I held a sign
39:36 for a weekend but I had to get back to
39:37 surfing because that's what I do there
39:40 are career [ __ ] starters in all these
39:42 regions and there's obviously great
39:45 people that don't believe in any of this
39:47 crap in all those resources as well
39:48 again this is a microscopic sort of
39:51 pathogen that we've caught this
39:54 cancerous virus that just needs to kind
39:56 of die you know the immune system that
39:59 is normality and the center moderate
40:03 American is just going to ignore them to
40:07 the point that they don't get the
40:09 reactions anymore but these kids love
40:12 getting on YouTube in a viral video they
40:14 love getting the mass media so every
40:16 time the 5 out of 6 news agencies put
40:19 them on the air hell even
40:20 Fox who put them on the air it just
40:22 energizes them to get out there and do
40:24 it again did you see me man when I hit
40:27 that chick in the face and then I ran
40:31 mm-hmm sure did tough guy sure did
40:35 you might classify these folks as
40:37 anarchists because they are chaotic and
40:39 strange they seem to attach themselves
40:43 to a purpose but they don't really have
40:45 one you know the subject I don't know if
40:47 I've really touched on this but let me
40:48 put this down because there's the I
40:51 forget the dude's name because I don't
40:53 give a [ __ ] about sports but the guy
40:55 that invented the kneeling from the was
40:58 it 49ers San Francisco 49ers big
41:02 surprise he started there right but now
41:05 we have like a handful of folks is still
41:07 kneel during the national anthem or
41:10 kneel before or whatever here's my take
41:13 on that because I was at a party once
41:15 for a guy I was like oh it was great
41:16 they said why are they kneeling well you
41:21 know the black life matters I said well
41:26 the first reason I heard was police
41:28 brutality then it morphed into just a
41:31 generic black lives matter as if no
41:33 other race matters right you know
41:36 Candace Owens has got a great take on
41:38 this by the way if you're not following
41:39 her whole stick I mean her Twitter or
41:43 whatever get into it you know I probably
41:46 has a YouTube too but I follow her
41:48 through Twitter I don't post on Twitter
41:50 I just look at a few geniuses talking
41:52 every once in a while but here you have
41:54 all these guys who are obviously
41:56 extremely talented at the sport of
41:58 football great awesome but they're
42:01 kneeling okay
42:03 they're trying to send a message right
42:05 in some I don't know just astronomically
42:10 stupid metaphorical way of annealing
42:13 during the the Constitution of the
42:14 United States what does that have to do
42:18 with this movement cops killing black
42:21 guys has to do with the national anthem
42:23 well that's a symbol of American
42:25 America's all screwed up and like okay
42:26 all right one move the [ __ ] out of this
42:29 country guys just pack your [ __ ] and get
42:32 the [ __ ] out of here that's my opinion
42:33 but the
42:34 second thing is take some of your money
42:36 all right if you're so brilliant and
42:38 profound that you're protesting take
42:41 some of your money and go do a PSA a
42:43 public service announcement give us your
42:46 big bony brain opinion about how
42:50 profound this situation is and then
42:52 maybe you want to look up like Candace
42:54 Owens suggests it was a beautiful black
42:57 American who's just I don't know what
43:00 our IQ is but it's it's insanely high
43:02 when the most articulate human beings on
43:04 this planet period male female or
43:06 whatever she says they're not studying
43:10 any of the facts that support this
43:12 accusation but they are dividing the
43:14 nation on public television and they're
43:17 doing it during their job they're taking
43:19 their personal opinion and dragging it
43:22 into the office basically how many of
43:25 you could take your personal grudge
43:27 against whoever take it in to work and
43:30 stand there during right before the
43:32 company say briefing by your CEO and
43:37 spew this crap and then everyone just
43:40 starts the meeting and goes on with
43:42 their day or whatever right you would be
43:43 fired so fast it would make your head
43:45 spin right that's why we don't do it so
43:49 if you're making a hundred million
43:49 dollars over ten years you got a little
43:52 bit of spending cash to get out there
43:54 and say this doesn't amaze you with NFL
43:56 has to do with my personal opinion maybe
43:58 get all together and do a big speech and
44:00 quote the facts of your claim so that we
44:04 can get alarmed by the truth or maybe
44:07 you study the facts and you realize
44:09 you're full of [ __ ] again I psyche
44:13 Candace Owens go see all her stuff on a
44:15 daily basis she's amazing
44:17 people I think wish that they understood
44:20 what the world is going through right
44:21 now but they don't pay attention
44:23 anything the people who are paying
44:25 attention are your cue and on and on
44:27 again doesn't matter that guy is JFK jr.
44:31 or some other Schmo doing some LARP or
44:34 he's a real agent inside the Trump
44:36 administration it doesn't matter doesn't
44:38 matter the guy barely posted any
44:40 information personally sites he links
44:42 out to everything's you can see it all
44:43 the source and get your own opinion
44:45 about things but he's raising the
44:46 awareness at an autistic level of detail
44:51 unbelievable connections that can be
44:53 proven in a court of law that's the cool
44:56 thing man so you're not sitting across
44:57 the table with someone in a beer making
44:59 a bunch of claims they can't be
45:02 cooperating because there's no source
45:04 this dudes legit all right I am yet to
45:09 see a single protest by anything in FIFA
45:12 or anything related to that type of
45:14 protest where someone put a mic up to
45:16 someone's face said what are you
45:18 protesting give me all the details all
45:20 the facts the cause and effect models of
45:22 why this is a threat to you and to me in
45:24 the whole world and just have one
45:26 intelligent person speak back I haven't
45:30 seen it one time right I think what's
45:35 really beautiful about what's going on
45:36 right now is that we are watching the
45:41 Democrats which I think again there are
45:45 Democrats that are good people in
45:46 America and there's probably a gigantic
45:48 portion way over 50% of the Democrats in
45:50 this country are actually normal human
45:52 beings that just have slightly
45:54 left-leaning opinions but there's that
45:57 that microscopic group that are led by
45:59 Feinstein and Pelosi and all these other
46:03 criminals where they're trying to
46:05 magnify these extreme left agendas right
46:09 but here's what's going on they are
46:13 burning their playbook they are trying
46:16 everything in the book that they can
46:18 they're not that intelligent in the
46:19 first place so everything is pathetic
46:22 the Cavanagh hearings or pathetic right
46:26 and so what happens is is you know if
46:28 you were to go see a magician I've got a
46:32 friend of mine who's an amazing magician
46:34 he performs at the Magic Castle he's one
46:39 of the best sleight of hand folks I just
46:40 talked about him recently he does these
46:44 tricks yeah but I only see him every
46:47 once in a while and part of its just
46:49 because he's in LA really deep in LA and
46:51 he's got a busy schedule I got a busy
46:52 schedule blah blah blah but there was a
46:54 time when he and I worked together
46:55 almost every single day several days a
46:57 week working on
46:58 pilot for him and I started to see some
47:01 of his tricks over and over and over
47:04 again
47:05 I watched him pickpocket and do all
47:07 kinds of things or guineas removing
47:09 watches and ties and belts and [ __ ]
47:11 people have no idea this is happening to
47:12 them and first time he did it to me it
47:15 was just utter magic I mean it was just
47:17 you have adrenaline flow into your body
47:19 and serotonin and you're just in heaven
47:22 and then I started watching him do it to
47:24 other people as I was I had to be a
47:26 cameraman for him at one point I started
47:30 seeing how it was done and all the
47:33 sudden it lost a bit of its magic right
47:34 I started figuring it out that's what's
47:38 happening on the Democrat side the
47:40 crazies the crazy Democrats right which
47:43 is again that tiny group they're
47:45 watching how they lie we're watching how
47:49 they will go to astronomical links to
47:53 accuse somebody of something they've
47:56 never done unbelievable we're also
48:01 seeing a lot of people get on television
48:02 newscasters that have had these
48:04 privileged jobs and they're getting out
48:06 there and embarrassing themselves saying
48:09 things that aren't true over and over
48:12 and over again every single night
48:13 they're being videotaped and it's going
48:15 on the internet and it's forever and
48:17 it's beautiful I'll walk into my smoke
48:20 lounge every once in a while and my
48:21 friends will say Oh God you see so and
48:23 so say this on CNN or say this on bah
48:25 bah bah bah bah I go they're all angry
48:27 and butthurt and I just said this is the
48:29 greatest thing ever
48:30 and he said why and I said because we
48:33 got him the world is waking up and
48:36 becoming very sane and very centralist
48:39 to very moderate with all things began
48:42 in the center of the two choices the
48:44 false paradigm of left and right we're
48:46 all finding ourselves in the center hey
48:48 I don't want to hurt you and in fact
48:51 let's go smoke a cigar let's go have
48:53 some barbecue let's get our kids to play
48:55 together or whatever well what's going
48:57 to be left is this unbelievably well
49:01 documented history of manipulation they
49:06 always say you know not to learn history
49:08 is to repeat it right
49:09 great these I want to use a big dirty
49:14 word right here but I won't but these
49:16 folks are recording themselves every
49:18 single night with big giant smiles on
49:20 their face thinking that they have
49:22 intellectually dominated the world it's
49:25 hilarious they literally go backstage
49:29 and they're surrounded by these elite
49:31 scumbags who pop them on the back
49:33 probably call him up man that show was
49:35 the best mr. ball and you were so
49:37 amazing on SNL right okay it's forever
49:43 man it's forever and when you find out
49:46 you're wrong when you find out that you
49:48 were selling out your country whether or
49:49 not you did it intentionally because you
49:51 got a pedophile think it hiding
49:52 underneath your you're history
49:54 or you're just idiot it's forever it's
49:58 awesome believe me I understand what I'm
50:01 doing too and you know it should be
50:03 noted as I reference myself and the I
50:07 don't know the billions of episodes and
50:11 minutes I've recorded that have been
50:13 watched okay so you change over time it
50:19 is my hope that folks that have
50:21 embarrassed themselves eventually figure
50:24 out that they were wrong not completely
50:27 wrong necessarily but they were just a
50:29 little too extreme
50:30 maybe a little too judgmental maybe they
50:33 misunderstood who a person was to have
50:36 someone say I totally know someone
50:39 because I met him a couple times it's
50:41 just crazy
50:42 right one of the most interesting
50:47 situations I've seen of someone sort of
50:49 repenting on camera was Geraldo Rivera
50:53 Geraldo Rivera yeah he after 9/11 was
50:57 extremely rude to the survivors of 9/11
51:01 that questioned the events of that day
51:03 and it went on for years I don't
51:05 remember how many years it seemed like
51:07 at least 10 years he would oh my god I
51:11 mean he went out once and started
51:12 cussing out someone in a in a public
51:15 event in New York and he was on stage
51:17 recording something and someone was shot
51:19 in something at him and he started
51:20 calling him names and
51:22 it's been a couple hosts that are gonna
51:23 chase them out of there their talk shows
51:25 at night on camera being the big hero
51:29 defending the truth of 9/11 that that
51:31 okay whatever and then he had the
51:34 wherewithal and the courage to meet one
51:37 of their surviving fathers and the
51:39 leader of engineers and architects for
51:42 9/11 truth who sat there with physics
51:46 and said what you saw was not what you
51:48 were told you saw because with that to
51:51 happen in a world of physics a bunch of
51:53 different things had to have occurred
51:54 and he listened and he was extremely
51:58 polite and at the end of the show which
52:00 I believe was his last show of that show
52:03 they canceled him maybe he knew he was
52:05 gonna be canceled I don't know the
52:06 details but he said I have to apologize
52:10 because this was a very emotional event
52:13 for me I'm from New York and I didn't
52:15 want to believe anything could be
52:16 different than what I was told because
52:17 it was so painful the official story
52:20 brings as much as it brings torment to
52:22 my soul it brought comfort to my soul
52:24 that the other stories aren't true but a
52:29 light way he just basically said you may
52:31 have convinced me that there's something
52:32 to this and I hope my god he repented
52:36 right on television and I haven't seen
52:40 him engage in that conversation since
52:41 maybe he has but I have no no knowledge
52:44 of that
52:44 but I thought that was cool he's not
52:48 saying he knows what it is and he's not
52:49 saying one person's right and one
52:50 person's wrong the architects and
52:52 engineers for 9/11 don't really get into
52:53 the motive and exactly who did it they
52:56 just simply say well the physics of what
52:58 you were told
52:59 planes hitting the World Trade Centers
53:01 it simply can't take down the central
53:03 World Trade Centers it just can't
53:04 something else had to have occurred okay
53:07 good what's fascinating to me is that a
53:10 lot of folks that are very very wealthy
53:13 they will never ever be poor are
53:16 convincing people that are are poor or
53:18 soon to be poor for the rest of their
53:21 lives because they don't have any
53:22 education who are protesting and again
53:25 hurting innocent people at protests and
53:27 taking paychecks by trees they're
53:30 telling these people to go out and do
53:31 their dirty work for them oh they might
53:34 do a little hit piece on television
53:36 or whatever but they go back to their
53:37 mansions they go back to their giant
53:38 bank accounts they don't worry about
53:41 anything right they're gonna survive but
53:44 you won't but you're supposed to do the
53:47 dirty work form right here's the thing
53:50 man we all have to remind ourselves that
53:54 when it really comes down to it when
53:56 religion is pulled out of the experience
53:58 of life when politics is parental pulled
54:00 out of the experience of life when it's
54:01 just two or more human beings in a
54:04 public gathering to just simply exist
54:08 and you don't know anything about
54:10 anybody you don't know that they don't
54:12 believe in Jesus or do believe in Jesus
54:14 you don't know anything about anybody
54:15 like when we're kids in the in the
54:18 playground we have no knowledge of
54:20 indoctrination when we're really young
54:22 all those videos of the black kid
54:25 hugging the white kid and the white kid
54:26 hadn't hugging the black kid and then
54:28 you know someone writes the caption over
54:30 like racism is is a taught thing it's a
54:34 hundred percent true right we don't want
54:36 any of this right we don't want anyone
54:40 to suffer if you want someone else to
54:43 suffer and they haven't done something
54:45 explicitly towards you unfairly right I
54:49 come into your house and steal your
54:50 stuff they come up to you and punch you
54:52 in the face you know no idea who they
54:54 are if that kind of event has not
54:55 occurred and you feel hatred towards
54:58 them then you're the sucker you are the
55:02 complete sucker and you've been had and
55:05 your level of intelligence at the point
55:06 you injected yourself with that game of
55:10 hating someone you weren't intelligent
55:14 enough to discern that you were being
55:16 had so okay how much longer in your life
55:20 do you want to be had how much longer do
55:22 you want to be a sucker the interesting
55:25 thing about the concept of being a
55:26 sucker is that at some point you will be
55:30 on your deathbed it's inescapable right
55:33 and it's at that point you measure your
55:36 life and you say well did I fight the
55:39 good fight was I a sucker wasn't I idiot
55:43 did I just waste every year I was alive
55:46 for the most part
55:48 well if you're a sucker on your deathbed
55:51 then maybe you did you know we're all
55:54 suckers here and there and it's not bad
55:57 to have been suckered in by something
55:58 and you get out of it because you you
56:00 suffer the pain you you wake up you
56:02 realize oh my god she was playing me he
56:04 was playing me duh that's fine that's
56:06 the best part of life waking up out of
56:09 those moments and learning from your
56:10 mistakes and doing whatever you can to
56:12 try and prevent that moving forward
56:14 that's what life is about that's the
56:16 awesome phase of life but to never wake
56:19 up to constantly stay in some hatred
56:22 mode hmm are there evil people in the
56:25 world that probably probably should gain
56:28 that opinion from us forever yes there
56:32 are there's evil dictators evil military
56:36 people evil people that just were were
56:40 horrible people their whole life and
56:42 they did you know we can wish them well
56:46 in the next world but in this world you
56:49 know maybe you find some sympathy for
56:50 them I don't know if you do great you
56:53 probably won that game too well I ever
56:56 Revere LBJ no never I think he
57:01 participated in the death of JFK and I
57:03 think he most definitely Green 'lets
57:05 using false flag operations Vietnam
57:09 which resulted in a horrible 11-year
57:13 slaughter totally unjust right well I
57:18 ever liked George Soros well he's got a
57:21 few years left before he's dead we'll
57:23 just see if he turns a new leaf but I'm
57:25 gonna probably estimate at this point no
57:28 I'm not gonna ever think anything good
57:30 about that guy ever well maybe there's a
57:32 cabal I don't even know about it's gonna
57:34 flip my opinion of everything that I
57:36 think is good who knows but at least you
57:39 and I are awake and we're thinking for
57:43 ourselves and we're using you know on
57:46 this show you use funny episodes to make
57:48 your brain think the moon missions are a
57:49 hoax or or space travel or whatever
57:52 using other things to massage your brain
57:55 into thinking for yourself so when the
57:56 important stuff comes around
57:58 you're ready it's easy right if you get
58:02 on the anon train of queueing on you and
58:05 you get into it and you try to
58:06 participate and breed and get into other
58:09 people's posts and why they think things
58:10 even if you don't agree with them and
58:12 they are in your brain massaging your
58:15 your circuitry making sure it flows
58:17 perfectly and you're probably but again
58:20 by using your brain you improve your
58:21 brain you use your synapse you grow more
58:23 synapse it's just the way it works right
58:25 there's a physical volume limit the size
58:28 of your brain in your head but other
58:30 than that which I'm pretty sure most of
58:32 us have a lot of extra space in there
58:34 and there's probably a lot of space in
58:37 our brain that's not being used as much
58:38 and we're turning it all on we're
58:39 basically walking in instead of like you
58:42 know the old scary movies where people
58:43 walked in dark rooms and you're walking
58:45 right past a light switch you turn to
58:46 forget light on you know thanking for
58:48 yourself is turning all the lights on in
58:50 a scary house giving yourself more
58:53 visual information to avoid the bad guy
58:55 or to dismiss that the gap bad guy was
58:58 really just a cat in the corner you know
59:00 the best thing that we can do to affect
59:02 change is to educate but there's nothing
59:06 more how do I say this
59:12 let me put it this way you cannot assume
59:17 I think anything more liable to being a
59:22 teacher meaning to teach something wrong
59:26 is probably one of the worst things you
59:31 can do I made plenty of mistakes on this
59:34 show where I've been I've been told the
59:37 wrong thing by someone that I trusted
59:39 and I didn't look it up to make sure
59:41 that at least there's some sort of
59:43 corroborating evidence or even just a
59:47 you know you could read like the
59:48 official story and you could read the
59:50 alternate theories and make a deduction
59:51 but sometimes I believe things or read
59:54 things sometimes they just make a
59:56 mistake I just get a number wrong in my
59:58 brain I just looked up one today as a
60:01 matter of fact I have said that I don't
60:03 know if I've said this on the show I
60:04 think I have several times unfortunately
60:07 the leader shabbos from
60:10 Venezuela who I believe was poisoned and
60:14 killed he died of a technically dead of
60:17 a massive heart attack and that is one
60:19 of the first weapons ever created was a
60:21 heart attack gun and there's all kinds
60:23 of ways to do it with all kinds of
60:25 different techniques just put it that
60:27 way most of you are familiar with that
60:28 but he also had colon cancer at the time
60:30 I have falsely claimed that he had
60:34 pancreatic cancer and he did not have
60:37 pain credit cancer and even his people
60:39 said that but his if it was the Ministry
60:41 of Defense and his country said we
60:43 definitely believe he was poisoned
60:44 because he just suddenly died it was
60:47 like he got this cancer and he had this
60:49 heart attack and passed away he
60:52 threatened the petrodollar and he said
60:54 he's gonna offer a barrel of oil for for
60:57 100 years for 50 bucks and soon as he
61:00 said that he had health issues and he
61:02 died and that country is now completely
61:04 upside down in a socialistic tailspin
61:06 right so when you do educate try to
61:10 educate I would say try to keep things
61:12 fairly primitive and simple simple
61:15 concepts that everyone can get on board
61:17 with common law is a great one do no
61:19 harm
61:19 right when you want talk about the
61:21 educational system it's pretty easy to
61:23 prove that at least fifty percent of
61:25 most education is coming out of colleges
61:27 in at least America around employable
61:29 they have the same cost though as the
61:32 one with the trade skill it's said it
61:36 said that we frown on kids that go off
61:38 to learn how to fix cars but we
61:40 celebrate the the child that gets a
61:42 degree in psychology it never becomes a
61:44 psychiatrist or psychologist if you want
61:47 to affect change educate be careful if
61:51 you're gonna be an educator you need to
61:53 re constantly about whatever you think
61:55 you're educating about you know I have
61:57 taught classes of incredible detail
62:00 about the brain and how the mind works
62:03 when telling stories or playing video
62:06 games but I spent six months and the
62:09 most incredible regimented research of
62:11 my life making sure that the script
62:14 worked because it's being vetted by the
62:15 ten year professor's before I was able
62:17 to teach it as I invented the class
62:18 right I was nervous
62:20 even teaching the class even after I had
62:23 and all my research I was very nervous
62:25 you know the other thing and this is
62:27 just a digression on teaching again for
62:30 the purpose of whatever you want to
62:31 teach but again we're talking about
62:33 trying to short-circuit chaotic moments
62:37 of anarchy or the feel the urge to
62:40 engage in such sort of renegade
62:43 last-ditch efforts methodology to get
62:46 what you want changed you usually don't
62:50 change anyone's opinion by calling them
62:51 a name real quick a lot of people get
62:54 out there and protest on chats and in
62:57 YouTube channels and whatever Twitter or
62:59 whatever Facebook and they're just being
63:02 acidic and so right from the very
63:04 beginning they'll say things like first
63:06 of all yeah I know everyone's made that
63:09 mistake I've made it basically what
63:12 first of all translates into the mind of
63:13 someone who's not likely to believe what
63:15 you think is you're an idiot
63:19 or dear idiot comma is what first of all
63:22 means it's a patronizing lead-in to a
63:25 explanation that otherwise it might be
63:27 very valuable be kind be empathetic to
63:31 their views I understand why you feel
63:34 this way I totally do we do I try to do
63:37 this on the show and I talk about kids
63:38 that are protesting and Berkeley or
63:41 something I'm sure if they again had
63:43 Talent
63:43 or something else that was awesome you
63:47 know when you do something that you love
63:49 you don't feel like you're working
63:50 that's the love of a trade skill or
63:53 talent of any kind but if I were truly
63:56 not to be on the show getting heated and
63:59 cussing every once in a while if I were
64:01 you if I went to Berkeley and spoke to
64:02 these kids and said look I understand I
64:05 understand the basics of what you feel
64:08 now let's talk about it because talking
64:12 about the problem it has its value but
64:14 talking about the solution is 10 times
64:17 the value so where do you want to be
64:19 forget everyone else in the entire world
64:21 for this moment we're in this auditorium
64:23 together where do you want to be so
64:26 let's pick out six people that are very
64:27 different in the audience and just go
64:29 for it right I'm sure we could find
64:32 solutions for people
64:35 and you're probably right under their
64:36 nose that's the funny part you could put
64:39 down their padlocks and their
64:41 skateboards and take off the stupid
64:42 masks and weird you know clothing with
64:45 color they might even look up their
64:47 media past and go oh my god I can't
64:49 believe I fell for all this yeah well
64:52 the good news is you're not falling for
64:53 it anymore
64:54 you found the solution which is just a
64:56 path right
64:59 the whole thing with Wizard of Oz
65:01 beautiful analogy was she was dragged
65:04 from Kansas to this crazy world where
65:07 the wizard lives in the city of Oz way
65:09 down there and what are the good witch
65:12 say the good witch says follow the
65:15 yellow brick road there's a bunch of it
65:16 now he's about bankers and stuff but
65:18 let's just take it down to the whole
65:19 thing of she was told her solution was
65:23 at the end of this path and technically
65:25 it was she meets the wizard behind the
65:28 curtain who's pulling all the lovers
65:30 right it's total metaphor for how the
65:31 world is being controlled
65:33 but eventually at the end she's told she
65:37 had the power all the time click your
65:38 heels together was right under her nose
65:40 the whole time and she just clicked her
65:42 heels together right after she landed
65:44 she wouldn't met anyone who wouldn't had
65:45 that experience well
65:47 so she's the wiser after the whole
65:49 adventure she made three good friends
65:50 right man I have to say I wouldn't want
65:53 to miss the lollipop guild if I was
65:54 there
65:54 so hopefully this episode is structured
65:57 enough they don't feel like you're
65:58 listening to a meandering person it's a
66:01 good suggestion it's a really good
66:03 suggestion I appreciate it I have a lot
66:06 of episodes in the queue and so I'm
66:08 going to be chugging them out fairly
66:11 quickly and they probably another pause
66:13 as I amassed more episodes any time I
66:17 have an episode where I've to create a
66:18 little bit artwork it really puts a
66:21 little pause and everything so that at
66:23 some point I feel like this episode
66:24 needs to go next and so I sit there and
66:27 I'll get into Photoshop and draw half
66:29 the images then I'll take another week
66:30 to get the other half out so I apologize
66:32 for the for the delays but for those of
66:35 you keep coming back there's a bunch of
66:37 new subscribers it's interesting when I
66:39 don't post videos I get this major surge
66:42 and subscriptions so I'm not going to
66:45 try to play that game but it's just
66:46 interesting how that happened
66:47 but if you haven't been to deep thoughts
66:49 radio.com that's sort of the jump off
66:52 point right you're like I found you on
66:54 YouTube where else can I find you you
66:56 just go to deep house radio calm you
66:58 could make that your way that you get
67:01 the episodes if you want if you don't

67:26 have to do that because I want all the
67:28 sort of the you know the spy accounts to
67:31 not get in there as much as we can but
67:34 there's a bunch of great regulars that
67:36 post really funny stuff and again you
67:39 don't have to agree with these theories
67:41 but man you know some of the I get
67:44 really entertained by the flat earth
67:45 posts that are up there because they do
67:48 make some really funny good points and
67:50 the really point out the fact that
67:51 people believe it's round with no
67:52 personal evidence they have book
67:55 evidence and academic evidence but they
67:57 haven't seen the earth from space you
67:58 know there's a bunch of problems with
68:00 old things so it just keeps you on your
68:01 toes right I guarantee it will make you

68:30 whole channel hats off to you because it
68:34 just baffles me that that all the

68:39 that you would not find episodes real I
68:41 can't listen to that there are some
68:43 episodes out there thinker gems that are
68:45 under 300 watches so if you want to see
