00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to uh
00:33 deep thoughts
00:34 in the sort of break between season five
00:38 and season six
00:40 so today as you can see we're going to
00:42 talk about
00:44 baby adults i'm sure the theme is pretty
00:48 obvious
00:50 now i want to make a precursor to this
00:53 like why would you listen to this
00:54 episode
00:56 the purpose of this episode is for those
00:58 of us who have to deal with baby adults
01:01 even if you resemble one of these traits
01:05 it does not mean you're a baby adult it
01:07 just means maybe
01:08 one little thing about you could be a
01:10 little
01:11 more mature and maybe in your particular
01:14 circumstance uh it's actually good for
01:17 you to have
01:18 some of these childlike qualities
01:20 because keeping your inner child is
01:22 obviously
01:23 very very useful at times
01:26 especially when you're around kids but
01:29 we're not talking about that
01:31 we're going to be talking about the
01:34 crybaby show that we see in the world
01:36 right now
01:38 especially online in social media
01:43 and uh even though i will most likely
01:46 throw out a few things
01:48 that'll be based on certain groups that
01:51 people
01:52 are in officially this is going to be
01:55 sort of across the board because i know
01:57 folks of all political orientations that
02:00 are
02:00 [Music]
02:02 sharing this exact problem but if you've
02:05 ever had to deal with it this
02:06 conversation is probably going to warm
02:08 your heart because one you'll know that
02:11 at least one other person in this world
02:13 sees this occurring
02:14 and we're going to talk about it and you
02:17 know sometimes you can feel that
02:18 something is wrong in the world
02:20 with either a single individual or a
02:21 group of individuals
02:24 and you can't quite put it into words
02:27 you're busy
02:28 and that's my job so let's
02:31 begin in
02:35 one 2020 the most amazing things that's
02:37 occurring as frustrating as it is
02:40 is that we have a bunch of people
02:42 complaining about
02:44 their relation to slavery
02:48 but they put a mask on they put slavery
02:51 right back on
02:52 it's crazy right so we should be
02:54 absolutely heightened to serfdom
02:57 and yet we are absolutely positively
03:00 brain dead
03:01 to what slavery tyranny control
03:04 and all the symbols over thousands of
03:07 years that have been used against man
03:09 to enforce the difference between the
03:11 haves and the have-nots
03:13 you got a mask on and you're not at risk
03:16 i mean you're not
03:17 a person who could die from
03:20 a common cold then what are you doing
03:25 have you ever noticed that one group of
03:27 people on social media
03:29 posts about their life look at me
03:32 i'm on a i'm on a boat enjoying my
03:34 family there's my kid at a softball game
03:37 or a dance recital or something else
03:40 and the other group is up there posting
03:43 stuff to try and control
03:45 other people's lives there's a
03:48 demarcation line right down the center
03:52 one's left and one's right so the baby
03:55 adult thing
03:58 i'm just gonna get personal tonight
04:01 is something that i grew up with because
04:03 i had two very young parents
04:05 and one of my parents my dad
04:08 was very um
04:12 he was very into kids like he is just a
04:14 big kid at heart
04:16 and there at times when he was younger
04:19 because he was
04:20 23 my mom was 21. at times you know
04:24 when i was a kid he was like the perfect
04:26 companion now
04:28 because he was also my disciplinary uh
04:31 he also manned up to own the discipline
04:34 layer and for the most part he got you
04:37 know
04:37 he gets to definitely a pretty high
04:39 passing score
04:40 for being flawless with the way he does
04:42 it now nobody gets a straight a
04:44 nobody so i don't expect that out of
04:47 anybody
04:50 but my mom was the opposite she was not
04:52 made for children
04:53 at best she was made for adults so there
04:56 was like this weird world
04:57 you know and
05:00 but there was a little catch on my mom's
05:03 side
05:04 on her side of the way she made
05:06 decisions
05:07 when both my parents had to tell me
05:10 what i needed to do and what i needed
05:12 not you know what i shouldn't do i
05:13 should say
05:15 i was always a pretty good kid you know
05:17 i went did crazy stuff but i never got
05:18 caught so
05:19 they didn't know about most of the stuff
05:21 i was doing until i was long past those
05:23 those years of being an honorary kid
05:26 but i remember being young and asking
05:30 for explanations to things
05:32 and one of my parents would explain it
05:36 to me
05:36 which is pretty much my dad and one
05:38 would just say because
05:40 i'm older and i'm your parent
05:44 which is with one child no other kids
05:47 and when you come home after work and
05:49 you stay at home all night long
05:51 she wasn't too busy to sit and explain
05:52 it to me she just chose to take that
05:54 trump card out and go
05:56 because i'm older i'm automatically more
05:58 intelligent than you
06:00 what's very very interesting is that has
06:02 continued all the way up till today
06:05 no matter what i study this is crazy
06:08 right
06:09 uh i'm a master at several different
06:11 things the few people in the world
06:14 even engaging now there's people way
06:16 over me and those categories and i have
06:18 them
06:18 i'm fortunate enough to know some of
06:20 them i should say
06:22 but i can get on the phone and on my
06:25 mom's side she's just trying to lecture
06:27 me about what i
06:28 what i know more than she's like she's
06:30 never even touched a particular area of
06:31 science
06:32 she's an expert she'll read a magazine
06:35 and oh oh i read you're wrong
06:37 because she's a she's a contrarian
06:40 that's her style of communication
06:43 so i grew up in this i grew up with baby
06:45 adults
06:47 as i got older and more intellectual the
06:49 connection with my dad was always sort
06:51 of
06:52 very fun but just never can get really
06:55 serious i can never have a kind like a
06:56 serious conversation with him
06:58 really and it's okay i mean i
07:02 if he doesn't have it to share with me
07:04 that i'm missing nothing
07:05 right and i got plenty of other people
07:07 like you
07:08 to talk to so as i grew up
07:13 very very quickly where i ended up
07:16 moving out of my
07:17 home with my dad at 16
07:21 i was uh pretty much taking care of
07:23 myself after that
07:24 i moved to california when i was 17. two
07:27 weeks later i turned
07:28 18 and then was like i'm out here on my
07:31 own
07:32 those of you watch the show regularly
07:34 you know this backstory
07:35 but what they did for me was a couple
07:38 things
07:40 now there's one side of it which is the
07:43 example i always use where
07:46 you know if you're now this didn't
07:47 happen to me but if a parent
07:49 were to routinely abuse their child
07:52 that kid has in my opinion a 50 50
07:55 chance of being abuser himself
07:56 or herself or they recognize what
08:00 happened to them
08:00 and they're absolutely the opposite
08:02 that's all different degrees right
08:04 i was always the opposite kid what i
08:07 don't like about
08:08 the way people treat me is is how i
08:11 reverse it and treat other people
08:13 so someone's mean i'm nice you know
08:16 i've had um throughout my entire career
08:19 from probably 87 to
08:21 2002 when i started working for myself
08:24 full time after that
08:26 every other boss i had was either
08:30 fantastic an amazing and a person you
08:33 could idolize
08:35 or the biggest jerk on planet male or
08:37 female didn't matter
08:39 i've worked for people that ended up
08:40 becoming racist revealing their racism
08:43 to people that would help immigrants off
08:46 a boat
08:47 you know i mean it's like angels and
08:49 demons back and forth back and forth
08:51 and initially i hated that cycle because
08:54 it just always happened
08:57 but eventually i realized man that
08:58 really
09:00 molded me in a way that i understood
09:01 both hemispheres of operation
09:04 allowing me to see the spectrum of
09:06 possibility
09:07 within other human beings and that's not
09:10 just
09:10 that's not accounting for friendships or
09:13 acquaintances that i might meet that
09:14 have the same
09:15 sort of polarity switching right now
09:17 obviously we don't hang out with jerks
09:19 for any length of time but sometimes
09:21 you'll be friend with a couple
09:22 friends with a couple people who have
09:24 that mutual buddy
09:26 who just can't get his act together and
09:27 he you know you can't convince the guys
09:29 to stop inviting the dude
09:31 and so you kind of have to put up with a
09:32 bunch of you know super negative stuff
09:36 but there used to be this thing about
09:38 [Music]
09:39 10 15 years ago pretty popular phrase
09:43 some some of us you know at times can
09:45 find places to use it
09:46 but it was always called the man-child
09:50 it's easy to say man child because men
09:53 are supposed to grow up to be men
09:54 they're supposed to take on the full
09:57 spectrum of responsibility aside from
09:59 bearing and raising
10:00 children in the spectrum that a woman
10:03 has a special sauce to do so
10:05 but men have a very important role in
10:07 their children's families and their
10:08 children's lives right
10:11 we now know that you know
10:15 out of every single person who's ever
10:17 been to prison
10:18 there's a gigantic percentage i don't
10:20 know what the percentage is i don't even
10:22 know if the state knows
10:24 where the father deserted the family
10:28 or wasn't there for some reason or
10:31 and the hubris of the state
10:35 to think that that's ever going to work
10:36 out of course the state engineers those
10:38 circumstances to break
10:39 us to be more dependent on them the
10:42 banks engineered
10:43 the destruction of the nuclear nuclear
10:45 family
10:46 by you know
10:50 constantly raising rates and
10:53 indoctrinating women and men
10:56 to break apart the family and get the
10:59 mom working as quickly as possible put
11:01 the kids in daycare
11:04 so that the state raised the children
11:05 right
11:07 or some other just knucklehead that runs
11:10 a daycare center some daycare centers
11:12 are great some are
11:13 and i mean like horribly awful right
11:18 so how can we break this conversation
11:19 down such that we can discuss it
11:23 and what are the ramifications of having
11:25 a whole society full of children
11:28 who are old
11:31 well i would say that this latest
11:33 situation in 2020
11:35 try not to say the word because then the
11:37 overlords of the people own this
11:39 service at least one of the most popular
11:42 options
11:43 will transcribe that use ai on it and
11:46 then
11:46 censor it even further right
11:50 it has brought out the biggest adult
11:53 ball babies i've ever seen in my life
11:57 who seem to lack just the most basic
12:00 common sense
12:02 it's seriously disturbing
12:05 how people have behaved during this
12:08 process
12:10 but where does it start well it's
12:13 probably a million ways it starts but i
12:15 can definitely tell you the one
12:16 archetype that i have seen to be true
12:20 is depending on depending on who
12:23 is giving out information you will see
12:25 the different levels of psychosis
12:27 inside people i think the most common
12:30 one
12:31 is the the male figure
12:36 in a particular person's life was either
12:39 abusive
12:40 or simply scary or at the
12:43 most minor extreme interested in
12:46 behaving
12:47 and putting down rules that will help a
12:49 kid
12:51 grow up to be very productive in life
12:55 and the kid just simply wanted to be
12:56 rebellious the whole time
13:00 i can tell you that uh well i think most
13:03 of us know this
13:04 if one of your parents is a disciplinary
13:06 because the other one is
13:08 kind of chicken [ __ ] out of the game
13:10 right
13:12 then you have the child the children or
13:14 child
13:15 tends to think that the disciplinary
13:17 parent is the jerk
13:19 and credits the parent that never stood
13:21 up to the plate to become a true adult
13:23 and a true parent
13:24 is the super duper wonderful parent
13:28 and that's usually doesn't last the
13:31 entire time because as the child
13:33 if the child has the fortune to wake up
13:36 and become an adult
13:38 they soon realize over time that they
13:40 have less and less compatibility with
13:42 the parent
13:43 that was always a child to begin with
13:45 and they tend to gravitate to the parent
13:47 that has been
13:49 you know responsible always part of
13:52 reality
13:53 never told any lies because lying is a
13:56 way to keep
13:57 people keep children satiated right
14:00 you tell them everything's going to be
14:01 okay even though it's not
14:03 some parents have even told kids
14:06 that um people don't die
14:11 is his daddy ever going to die no
14:13 sweetie
14:14 you know figuring that later on they're
14:16 going to hedge the bet that the child
14:18 will grow up and find out from other
14:19 people that we all do die in the end
14:21 but then they have this little
14:22 subconscious trigger in them
14:25 that the parent was a liar
14:28 maybe they're you know most of us i
14:30 think are mature enough to say well my
14:32 parents
14:32 told me that to keep me satiated as a
14:36 child
14:38 but that disconnect with the parental
14:41 unit if i were to call him that which is
14:43 horrible a father or a mother
14:45 is where it all starts to go wrong
14:50 because think about enough you you're
14:53 listening to this and you feel like you
14:55 have a
14:56 you know you're not perfect but you have
14:58 a you know as good as it gets
15:00 kind of life which i think is the best
15:02 life you can get is the
15:04 best one you can muster out of things
15:06 and you've been through different stages
15:07 in your life maybe even through some of
15:08 these stages
15:09 but you feel like you're an adult now
15:10 you're taking responsibility you're not
15:12 getting everything right
15:13 don't worry about that just keep trying
15:15 it'll get better and better over time
15:17 right
15:18 if you're at that capacity then i'm
15:20 pretty sure the following
15:22 theme of what i'm about to say is true
15:24 for you
15:26 which is that we typically learn how to
15:28 be something that we're not
15:30 by apprenticing someone who is good at
15:33 what we want to do
15:35 and as a child when you're stuck in a
15:37 home you can't leave
15:38 it's illegal for you to go out without a
15:41 legal guardian over you
15:44 then you have to emulate either a big
15:46 brother big sister
15:47 a father or a mother a lot of cases we
15:51 have aunts and uncles
15:52 and grandparents that can also fill
15:54 those roles
15:55 like the old saying goes it takes a
15:57 village sometimes to raise a kid
15:59 completely
16:00 and i believe that wholeheartedly
16:03 so imagine that you're in a i'm going to
16:06 give you a contrasting thing
16:09 you're in a small town like me uh when i
16:11 grew up
16:12 i had both grandparents living literally
16:15 a country block
16:16 from each other country blocks are about
16:19 uh
16:20 i'd say half the city block really close
16:24 my aunts and uncles all lived with my
16:26 grandmother
16:28 who had younger kids and then my other
16:29 uncle was an optometrist in town
16:34 my town had a full lineage of
16:37 you know hundreds and hundreds of
16:39 generations you know all combined into
16:41 one you know living about maybe four
16:43 generations after the town
16:44 was created in the mid-1800s by them all
16:48 knowing you
16:48 and knowing your parents and knowing
16:50 your lineage
16:51 then there's expectations set on you how
16:53 to behave regardless if they're there to
16:55 influence you whatsoever
16:57 but as they tell you that various
16:59 members of your family are
17:02 are very revered in town because they
17:03 have a good upstanding name
17:06 you want that review for yourself even
17:09 as a child
17:10 and so you start to emulate those people
17:13 that
17:13 are like hey your grandfather's always
17:15 been a great guy your darren probably
17:17 passed away well he was great too and
17:18 your grandmothers were awesome and your
17:19 aunts and uncles so you have this
17:21 influence
17:22 this constant beautiful flowing
17:25 ebbing influence it's not disciplinary
17:28 it is just the way of the land
17:32 now take a family
17:35 or a person from all those little towns
17:37 maybe or someone who's living in the
17:39 city their whole life probably a better
17:40 example
17:41 and it's a big city it takes
17:45 an hour to cross town so you don't cross
17:48 down
17:48 you know your grandmother's in that city
17:50 another grandma's in that city
17:52 everybody's divorced and so you're in
17:54 this tiny microcosm now
17:57 you may have both your parents for a
17:59 little while until america
18:01 convinces your parents to divorce
18:03 because something went wrong
18:04 and it's always the first thing you do
18:08 and now where are the role models
18:12 um well what i'm about to mention
18:15 happens in the midwest as well
18:17 but there's a difference what happens in
18:19 the midwest
18:20 is that you have that really close
18:22 during your formative years
18:24 network of family members and the town
18:27 all working together
18:28 to give you a vision of how we grow up
18:31 properly
18:32 what men become what women become
18:35 it's not a hard line between the two but
18:38 there are definitely things that
18:39 you're supposed to engage in on both
18:41 sides men can't have babies
18:43 women don't have upper body strength so
18:45 there's things that we do that are
18:46 specific to us
18:48 and so you have this centrifuge holding
18:50 you in place
18:53 now in the big city like i just said
18:56 that
18:56 can happen and that can also not happen
18:59 i've seen
19:00 i would say yeah one out of ten families
19:01 i've met in la
19:03 have it one out of ten and that's being
19:06 generous
19:07 nine of them don't have any of that
19:10 raised by one parent
19:11 the other parent moves to another state
19:13 and they never see them or they're
19:14 flying back and forth and it's just
19:16 the kids being abused with travel
19:19 burdens just to see both parents while
19:21 both parents stay where they're put
19:23 right
19:25 so where do we get our heroes when there
19:27 are none
19:29 we get them from celebrities and what
19:32 are celebrities
19:33 i mean really you're a normal human
19:36 being
19:37 and you do something and then the press
19:40 the tmz's of the world tell you that
19:43 that person has suddenly become
19:46 a celebrity even before you've ingested
19:49 any of their materials
19:51 their offerings they're telling you who
19:53 to worship
19:55 so as long as that are that that society
19:58 stays
19:59 moral and as long as that process is
20:02 organic like elvis presley right
20:04 elvis earned his
20:08 stripes to say so to say right
20:11 but today there are agendas
20:14 to accomplish things inside our children
20:18 and so they pick some of the most
20:20 despicable human beings on planet earth
20:23 and tell your kid this is a famous
20:26 person
20:27 this is a person you are to emulate
20:30 they are everything that you want to be
20:33 and then your kid's brain starts to
20:36 atrophy starts to grow really bad
20:39 circuitry
20:42 and then you have a problem with your
20:43 child because they're going off in a
20:45 completely different direction
20:48 now we know that all kids again like i
20:50 always say
20:51 naturally go through a rite of passage
20:55 as i mentioned in a few episodes back
20:57 the right way for right of passage
20:59 to be experienced is for the
21:03 adults to gradually over time
21:06 hand off very on point to the child
21:11 a little bit of authority that you would
21:13 normally
21:14 give to them you let them own that
21:18 little piece
21:18 i'll give you an example it's always
21:21 tough getting kids into bed at night
21:22 they're full of energy depending on how
21:24 you feed them
21:24 you can be blasting hot at nine o'clock
21:27 at night and they need to go to school
21:28 tomorrow
21:29 and you know dragging them out of bed is
21:30 a wonderful process
21:32 so you know you got to get some sleep
21:34 and they need more sleep than you
21:36 so if your kid gets to the point where
21:39 they're
21:40 able to go to bed you might just say
21:42 okay here's what's gonna happen
21:44 i'm not gonna tell you when you gotta go
21:45 to bed i'm gonna let you put yourself to
21:48 bed
21:49 but you know the game the game is you
21:51 gotta get a good amount of sleep
21:53 however many hours you think they should
21:54 get eight to ten hours and i'm gonna get
21:56 you out of bed in the morning
21:58 to the degree you get out of bed every
21:59 morning without complaint
22:02 you get to own your bedtime and the
22:05 kid's got inspiration
22:06 they've got incentive they get to
22:09 control when they go to bed
22:11 you've handed it off instead of making
22:13 them take it from you
22:15 because what we do today is we don't
22:16 know how to parent at all today in my
22:18 opinion
22:18 i have a great parenting episode by the
22:20 way it's back in season one i believe
22:22 go to the website deepthoughtsradio.com
22:24 for the link
22:26 so with today's
22:30 media that's out there you've got
22:33 not only the official celebrities
22:35 getting famous
22:37 we say that with tongue-in-cheek quotes
22:40 right
22:41 but now you've got apps like tick-top
22:43 tick-tock making people
22:45 kind of celebrities a random person you
22:47 don't know
22:48 has got two or three million followers
22:52 sometimes that's organic sometimes it's
22:54 heavily orchestrated by the people that
22:55 own the app because they want a lot of
22:58 reasons for you to come back to the app
22:59 so they'll help
23:01 everyone like a particular profile
23:04 they're not really into them after they
23:05 like them half the time
23:06 but they still click like or they just
23:08 beef the number up
23:09 and you have no idea if it's real or not
23:12 it's today your kids walking around
23:14 being influenced by random people in the
23:15 world
23:17 well as a parent typically you don't
23:20 just let your kids spend the night with
23:21 any kid
23:22 because they don't know maybe it's a
23:23 meth head parents
23:25 you know or parent maybe dad's in
23:28 over there's an alcoholic you don't want
23:29 your kid in that household you know the
23:31 rumor about that house over there you
23:33 see him
23:33 and hear him argue other parents talk
23:35 about those those kids and
23:37 until they get their act together you
23:39 don't want to hurt the kid maybe that
23:40 kid can stay at your house but you don't
23:41 want your kid going over the other house
23:42 getting molested
23:44 but the internet breaks down that
23:45 barrier doesn't it now he could be
23:48 walking right into
23:50 the devil's den and you're not even
23:52 there to protect your child
23:54 because they have this little thing
23:55 called a cell phone censorship
23:57 give me a break it used to be a porn
24:00 site i had to ask you which how old you
24:01 were whether or not you're 18 or over
24:03 to see the materials on the website they
24:05 don't have to ask you that anymore
24:07 you can walk right in as soon as your
24:09 kid turns off safe search on
24:11 any one of the search engines out there
24:13 oh my god
24:14 you could search on cup of coffee and
24:18 you'll find the most horrific images
24:20 that your child should never see
24:22 images at first your child can't even
24:23 process what they're looking at
24:26 but it's forbidden and unknown and no
24:28 one's there to explain it to them
24:29 you don't know they're seeing it so you
24:31 don't know to get in there and say okay
24:32 here's the thing about that you know
24:36 and then what happens if a parent tries
24:38 to
24:38 [Music]
24:40 get involved and shut that down who's
24:43 gonna get blamed
24:45 going to get blamed you're protecting
24:47 them from something that will destroy
24:48 their life potentially
24:50 mentally maybe even physically people
24:52 ran off all these kids ran off with bus
24:54 tickets on craigslist and
24:56 we never saw him again so
24:59 now the parents are run by the children
25:05 well what's that do to the algorithm of
25:07 growing up
25:08 and being a parent they never grow up
25:12 because they can
25:14 now maybe the parent maybe the kids
25:16 eventually leave at 18 years old or
25:17 whatever
25:19 now the parent has groomed themselves
25:20 for 18 years
25:22 to talk and baby talk in one way or the
25:24 other not not literally speaking
25:28 but they're afraid to dish out something
25:30 that would actually work
25:32 because last time they did that their
25:34 pride and joy
25:36 disowned them uh in my own experience as
25:40 being a parent
25:41 i refuse to compromise those rules i
25:44 refuse to ever lie to my kid
25:46 save santa claus or something which i
25:48 probably wouldn't have done the second
25:49 time
25:52 but i took the hits and now as my kid
25:54 grows up
25:55 she's finding out that her dad is
25:57 actually
25:58 a hundred percent love me or hate me i'm
26:01 100
26:02 my integrity is at the maximum i can
26:04 push it to
26:06 and so there's starting to be some more
26:08 fuzzies there but it's that process
26:10 right and it's funny because
26:13 i've talked to a lot of female friends
26:14 of mine
26:17 and they were always assuring me don't
26:18 worry those phases
26:20 that's what i went through around this
26:21 age it'll all change and they were 100
26:24 correct it's amazing
26:27 but what is the number one attribute of
26:29 a baby adult
26:33 i think it has to do with not being able
26:34 to deal with reality
26:37 so many lies have gone into the minds of
26:39 a baby adult
26:41 dreams that were construed as goals
26:45 never get realized
26:47 right i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do
26:48 that and some crazy idea
26:51 that this few in the world could ever
26:53 pull off with an infinite amount of
26:54 money in an infinite amount of time
26:57 but they hang on to hang on the four or
26:59 five of them these fantasies
27:02 they don't take any action to go get
27:03 them because that's an adult thing
27:05 that's a responsibility thing
27:09 and so by the time that they should be
27:11 they're starting to get
27:12 wrinkles on their face their skin's
27:15 changing their hair is falling out
27:16 they're getting a bunch of weight on
27:17 their gut
27:20 they don't have any means to deal with
27:22 all those natural processes
27:24 let alone conceivable and so
27:27 then you start to see the other
27:30 underlying layers
27:32 one of them being narcissism right
27:35 the maturity of a human being that tries
27:38 to control another human being that is
27:39 not their family
27:41 and not someone they're assigned to
27:43 control like
27:44 a child i mean control kind of lightly
27:46 but you know you're trying to get your
27:48 kid on the right track
27:49 but a random stranger on social media
27:53 will be lecturing you about how to
27:54 behave especially in 2020
27:56 how to wear a mask right what a joke
28:00 we're quarantining the healthy they're
28:03 forcing everyone to go bankrupt
28:04 i mean looking back on this era i hope
28:07 it is the most
28:09 unbelievable and i mean that literally
28:11 most unbelievable
28:13 year in world history that a bunch of
28:16 people
28:16 who don't know you don't know your needs
28:19 don't know your situation
28:21 made a phone call and ended the world
28:25 that's all it took to get all of these
28:28 baby adults to put their mask on
28:31 a friend of mine told me the other day i
28:34 wear the mask i don't want to be an
28:35 [ __ ]
28:37 what i became a slave because i don't be
28:40 an [ __ ]
28:41 what does that mean right now you've
28:44 gotta
28:45 you gotta fight this process because
28:46 otherwise it will become the new norm
28:50 we are being treated like children
28:53 and the baby adults love it because
28:57 they are children remember when i told
29:00 you that the baby boomers loves
29:02 socialism
29:05 well my parents entire generation
29:10 is packed full of parents that
29:14 um in some cases
29:18 they were rulemongers themselves as kids
29:22 and so they love being rule mongered
29:25 right they love the stockholm syndrome
29:27 thing other people in their generation
29:29 borrowed money from their parents until
29:31 they were in their 60s until their
29:33 parents actually died
29:34 and there was no more money to borrow
29:37 then they're like god i need socialism
29:39 to pay my bills
29:42 now remember what i always say about you
29:44 know military service i just said it
29:46 a couple episodes back the military
29:49 knows
29:50 that by the age of 25 morality
29:54 of your actions starts to sink into the
29:56 brain
29:57 according to some scientists you don't
29:59 develop these particular connections in
30:01 your mind until you're around 25.
30:03 so it's like a biological threshold that
30:06 you have to cross before you start
30:08 realizing that shooting a gun into a
30:10 five-year-old's face
30:11 matters some people are just
30:14 inbred morons that do that kind of stuff
30:17 but even for those that aren't
30:18 they still have a problem digesting it
30:20 so the soldiers of the world
30:22 who are sent to war are typically
30:25 between the ages of 19 and 23.
30:28 the military knows this
30:32 look at all of the
30:35 the writers and looters and violent
30:38 people in the world right now
30:41 what happens today is that they know
30:43 they
30:44 being agenda 21 architects which is
30:47 pretty much all you have to say
30:48 you haven't seen my episode on gender21
30:51 you might just want to stop this episode
30:52 and go look at it because it's more
30:54 important than anything i've ever said
30:55 on any show
30:56 is the only conspiracy going on right
30:58 now but it's global and it's a hundred
31:00 percent
31:02 but they've got the world rigged
31:04 beautifully
31:05 for evil they know
31:09 that they got your kid for at least 23
31:11 years because you're not participating
31:12 as a parent and if you are then you're a
31:14 hero
31:16 they got your kid on well but they got
31:18 your kid in daycare as soon as possible
31:20 they got them in grade schools grade
31:21 schools are now teaching a bunch of
31:23 bunk science trying to teach your kids
31:26 there's more than two genders
31:28 teaching climate change is real
31:31 all this stuff go see my episode on
31:33 global warming if you have any problem
31:35 with that
31:36 little statement i will uh pound that
31:39 into the dirt for you
31:41 right in front of your very face kids
31:44 are now indoctrinated
31:47 prior to that threshold of
31:50 self-realization
31:53 because the parents aren't there to
31:55 steer them and because life never
31:56 becomes like the parents
31:58 typically pitch their children you know
32:01 get a degree
32:02 you'll automatically get a job find one
32:05 thing and do it better than all the
32:06 other things and then you'll be employed
32:09 forever for one or two companies
32:13 and then you'll retire with a big
32:14 pension and then you'll also get your
32:16 social security
32:17 that's how life's gonna go you're gonna
32:18 marry someone have kids live happily
32:20 ever after they're gonna have their own
32:22 man i don't know anybody who's having
32:24 that life right now
32:26 i mean there's a couple people my
32:27 neighborhood's one of the best places on
32:29 planet earth but that's actually a
32:30 reality
32:31 that you have to come to a conservative
32:33 orange county california
32:34 where that happens or the midwest where
32:37 it happens
32:37 right but it's starting to infect
32:41 every sector of the world no matter
32:43 where you live you could be a
32:45 farmer in west china and they'll find a
32:48 way to get you
32:49 get you upside down but they know that
32:52 your kid
32:53 will follow leaders and hero groups
32:58 because they have a void in their system
33:01 they weren't made self-reliant they
33:04 weren't taught critical thinking
33:07 because the short attention span theater
33:09 which is a cell phone
33:10 or any internet access device is there
33:14 to
33:14 satiate and create a little dopamine
33:17 trigger
33:18 for satiation so i know what's on what
33:21 happened in the news today boom
33:22 dopamine drop oh one of those new
33:24 tic-tac-toe dopamine drop
33:26 i wonder if anyone liked my post on
33:28 instagram narcissism narcissism
33:30 narcissism
33:31 dopamine dopamine dopamine you become
33:34 addicted
33:34 just like cocaine or anything else in
33:36 life
33:38 so your kid starts taking bad advice
33:40 this is not yours as early as they can
33:42 possibly get to these devices
33:45 and then they don't think about things
33:47 remember what i said the tesla said
33:49 is that people focus too much on outside
33:51 things that don't have anything to do
33:53 with their life
33:54 and that robs them of their own of
33:57 accessing their own imagination
34:01 if i were to thank god say i was in
34:04 front of him
34:06 and we had that little meeting after
34:07 death and
34:09 of course there's thanking him for your
34:11 own life and your family that you're
34:13 involved in i got lucky with that one
34:16 probably the number one thing i would
34:17 thank god about
34:19 is being born the year i was born
34:22 i think everyone before me for at least
34:24 100 years could probably say the same
34:26 thing
34:26 because if you see what happens today
34:29 being born later
34:30 when i was born put you at huge risk and
34:32 i would say pretty much born in the 90s
34:36 you're you're on the precipice of utter
34:38 disaster being born in the 21st century
34:41 i think you have about a 99 chance of
34:43 being completely screwed by the system
34:46 doesn't mean you're not a good person
34:47 doesn't mean that people aren't affected
34:49 by it wouldn't have otherwise turned out
34:50 to be great productive human beings
34:52 and for those that actually do turn into
34:55 totally productive human beings
34:57 they're superheroes you know i took a
35:00 little contract job
35:02 because i read the company bio and i'm
35:04 so impressed two guys in their 20s
35:07 that started this real estate company
35:09 they were centered in long beach at the
35:10 time they've now moved around because of
35:12 the
35:12 thing that's going on 25 year old
35:16 27 year old built this company by
35:18 themselves
35:20 they one guy slept in a hammock over
35:22 another guy's
35:24 sofa for two years so they could save
35:27 their money and keep their servers on
35:28 when they started their company
35:30 these dudes are superheroes
35:33 because they're born in a generation
35:35 that says you know in the 90s
35:37 that they should have paid attention to
35:38 other things and they blocked it all out
35:41 amazing i was talking to some friends on
35:44 this patio the other day and i said you
35:46 know
35:46 we need to find a way to make it trendy
35:49 to be retro
35:51 and we have had some little spurts of
35:53 that here and there i know one of my
35:55 friend's sons
35:56 used to buy retro um suits and retro
35:59 jewelry like old digital watches from
36:02 the late 70s
36:02 super cool you get them all for nothing
36:04 online
36:06 that was cool but we need to take it to
36:09 the next level which is
36:11 brand social media an old man's game
36:14 i'll get on that crowd that's for old
36:16 people
36:17 that's like you know rotary phones and
36:19 telephone books like don't
36:21 just let them do their thing you're
36:22 supposed to live life
36:24 teach them about the uh hyper narcissism
36:27 episode
36:28 yeah that's for hyper narcissists what
36:31 yeah they just they want you to love
36:33 them through online media because they
36:34 don't have any other means of being
36:36 satisfied with their own life
36:37 outside of a virtual virtual
36:41 approval from friends they don't even
36:43 know
36:45 yeah if you have a creation you know
36:48 you do need to have if you want to get
36:50 people to see your creation unless you
36:52 live in a big city and you can go to
36:53 parties where people
36:54 will come online to see you or engage
36:57 your service then maybe that's the only
36:58 thing you can do
37:00 that's my plague with my curse i should
37:03 say with deep thoughts radio
37:05 there's no other way to get you guys to
37:07 see the show
37:09 but i think that our personal lives are
37:10 probably a lot more old school
37:12 no matter how old you are because we're
37:14 of like mine
37:17 the goal would be in my opinion
37:21 to isolate some of these things isolate
37:23 behaviors
37:24 that are otherwise repulsive outside
37:28 of this microcosm we call our reality
37:32 don't go online i will say someone goes
37:34 online and tells you just wear a mask
37:36 man
37:37 yeah i do want you to worry about your
37:39 own life but you're putting other people
37:41 at harm no i'm not because the mask
37:43 ain't doing nothing
37:45 distancing that's the only thing i can
37:46 do for you and that's what i do
37:49 during this ridiculous thing now a lot
37:51 of dudes go up and shake my hand really
37:53 hard
37:54 dude thanks for not wearing a mask
37:55 that's great others are all freaked out
37:58 you know
37:59 all right baby adult i'll keep six feet
38:02 from you
38:03 i don't want to catch what you got
38:04 anyway don't catch any more
38:06 baby adult germs but here's
38:10 here's the sales pitch of becoming a
38:13 real adult
38:15 because this is the trick of the trade
38:16 man
38:19 what's really really funny and i've said
38:21 this several times and this is something
38:22 worth repeating in public especially to
38:24 your more liberal friends
38:27 you say look man if you're liberal
38:31 in america at least can't speak for any
38:32 other country then you're one of these
38:34 don't tell me what to do people hey
38:38 i actually like that but how come they
38:41 go online and tell you what to do
38:43 how come the actual counter theme of
38:45 their existence is a paradox of them
38:48 trying to tell everybody else who they
38:50 are
38:51 they're a racist right which means they
38:53 are anybody saying that's a racist i
38:55 guarantee you man
38:56 they're just in solid projection mode
39:01 the other one is telling you how to
39:02 handle your own health
39:04 i know people that are obese telling me
39:06 to wear a mask i know people that are
39:08 absolutely unhealthy because they've
39:09 abused their body telling me to wear a
39:11 mask
39:12 hey uh i think you're uh
39:16 probably the pot calling the kettle
39:19 black you know
39:20 you take care of your own life there
39:21 buddy missy
39:25 that other world is an artificial world
39:29 and when you become an adult what's
39:31 awesome is you start living in reality
39:34 and as much as you might think from
39:37 being inside the womb you don't want to
39:38 be born yet because it's all warm and
39:40 fuzzy in there man and food's just
39:42 injected right in your belly button
39:43 right
39:44 they want to keep that umbilical cord
39:45 stuck to their mummies
39:48 they don't want to be born it's because
39:51 they can't conceive of this reality
39:53 the baby adult loses i think at one
39:56 point
39:58 the biological slash mental capability
40:02 of conceiving of what it's like to be an
40:04 adult and so they never become one
40:07 some of them try to sing that whole
40:09 thing that peter pan theme well
40:10 i want to get old and i don't know it's
40:12 okay man i live a very young life
40:15 but i'm still an adult i like
40:18 geeky things i like young things you
40:20 know
40:21 if i have a little little grandson or
40:23 granddaughter and and he or she wants to
40:25 build legos men i'm there and they will
40:27 not know that i'm
40:28 50 years older than them you know
40:30 because i'll be in there like oh gosh
40:31 you know i'll be getting confused and
40:33 just like they are so you can keep all
40:36 those qualities
40:38 but now let's go back to dreams
40:41 the pitch of being an adult is that
40:44 you really can't get your dreams i think
40:47 besides that one in a million where
40:49 someone tapped you on the shoulder and
40:50 said
40:51 i'm going to make you a star or whatever
40:52 the hell your dream is right
40:55 those things happen but again that's the
40:57 lottery ticket life
40:58 and episode about that too
41:01 they take these you know you see them
41:03 all the time on the internet
41:04 you know i help people make fifty
41:06 thousand dollars a week
41:08 yeah right yeah uh i hang out in bel air
41:11 country club
41:12 if that was a possibility then all these
41:14 dudes would be
41:15 using this nobody online buying an ad
41:18 trying to steal 70 bucks from you to
41:20 download a pdf to
41:22 blow smoke up all your holes right but
41:24 what do they do they show you an
41:26 infomercial
41:27 online used to be on tv really at night
41:30 but now it's
41:31 online these ads are like two hours long
41:34 skipping 15
41:34 seconds right they're telling you that
41:37 all these people
41:38 who give testimonies and made a bunch of
41:40 money
41:42 well those are their groomed if they're
41:44 real they're groomed
41:46 people that this person who managed to
41:48 make a bunch of money probably through
41:49 some different means or maybe to the
41:51 same means but they're the lucky few or
41:52 they work
41:53 really really hard and their customers
41:55 could never work that hard
41:57 they passed them some gigs right imagine
42:00 you
42:00 wanted to make 10 million dollars online
42:04 so you take a million bucks and you feed
42:07 it to
42:07 10 people each person makes about a
42:11 hundred
42:11 thousand dollars in a really short
42:13 period of time and that when you got
42:14 them all at the peak because you've been
42:16 playing them all at the same exact time
42:18 you get all their testimonies and sign
42:20 away all the right so they can't pull
42:21 the
42:22 adders i don't want to be in that
42:23 anymore
42:25 nothing they could sue you about and you
42:28 run that little infomercial on youtube
42:30 and you
42:30 got 10 people that have made a hundred
42:32 thousand dollars in the last six months
42:35 and they're static man they really
42:36 didn't get that money but then you
42:38 scrape off the internet two to ten
42:41 million dollars
42:42 and crap product that you're selling the
42:44 internet
42:46 they made their money back and then some
42:49 preying on baby adults
42:53 everybody in life wants control of their
42:55 life
42:56 everybody even baby adults
42:59 baby adults will get to a point where
43:01 they can't do it like i said
43:03 for those of us who've sort of this is
43:06 kind of a crude term now that we want to
43:07 definitely be
43:09 inclusive to both genders but we call it
43:11 manning up right
43:14 women do it too but when you man
43:17 up and you eat everything life has to
43:20 give you
43:21 good or bad and hopefully you don't have
43:23 a horrible life
43:24 when those tough moments came around
43:28 you face the head-on and what happens
43:30 when you do that
43:32 you learn a bunch don't you sucking in
43:35 my body on the patty of the day and i
43:36 said you know
43:39 i was talking to him and i said you know
43:40 the one thing you and i have in common
43:42 as i said we both have learned
43:44 everything the hard way
43:46 and he immediately just went yes he
43:48 nodded his head he goes absolutely i
43:50 said you know we learned a whole lot
43:51 more about how to do that
43:52 because we did it on our own we figured
43:54 it out
43:56 without necessarily manuals and mentors
43:59 and we probably would have taken the
44:01 mentor the manual
44:02 but in just the way life distributed all
44:05 this stuff
44:06 we ended up doing it the hard way
44:10 and what that teaches you is that you
44:12 can actually do something
44:14 no matter how hard it is you do it
44:19 i told you you know i think the term i
44:20 may have used in a previous episode but
44:22 just in case i haven't said this
44:24 i can't today i call it jumping off a
44:25 cliff
44:27 you just see a challenge you kind of
44:30 just
44:31 it's almost subconscious it's almost
44:33 like god himself goes
44:36 you can do this remember all the other
44:38 stuff it's it's metaphorically or
44:40 thematically
44:41 exactly like all those other things
44:43 you've done in your life
44:44 that you never did before except for now
44:47 you're wiser
44:48 you're more astute you're like sherlock
44:51 holmes says
44:52 you look and you see you see everything
44:56 and so as this
44:57 new challenge comes about
45:00 you roll with the punches and you get
45:02 punched a lot less
45:04 because you're not a baby adult
45:08 what's the baby adult dude typically
45:10 they stay in their lane
45:12 they stay in their little baby lane you
45:14 know
45:16 every quarter mile they get a new diaper
45:19 every tenth of a mile they get a new
45:20 mask
45:22 they wear it in their car right this has
45:25 got to be like the
45:27 the easiest iq test i mean what's
45:30 interesting is you used to drive in your
45:32 car in california which we have a lot of
45:34 traffic right
45:35 and you'd see someone drive really bad
45:37 and there's a few
45:39 you know exceptions to the rule a young
45:41 kid is learning how to drive an old
45:42 person is going
45:43 crazy like joe biden or a foreigner
45:47 who may have moved from china and they
45:49 rode a bicycle until they were 50
45:52 and now they're in a big giant mercedes
45:54 and
45:55 you know it's intimidating right so we
45:58 usually cut everybody
45:59 slack who's in those realms but when you
46:02 see people
46:03 who are healthy wealthy and wise driving
46:05 horribly
46:06 you're like they must just be a low
46:08 vibration person
46:10 and today when i see someone wearing a
46:12 mask in a car with the windows rolled up
46:15 suffocating themselves cancerizing all
46:17 their cells right toxifying
46:19 their entire biological system
46:23 you're like whoa i can see people's iqs
46:27 you know i can see i can see the fact i
46:30 can just literally look out at public
46:32 down go
46:33 i know who can't think for themselves
46:36 now i feel sorry for people that have
46:38 jobs where their state
46:40 says you have to wear it so we'll cut
46:42 them some slack because they gotta earn
46:43 a living
46:44 what else you're gonna do but if you
46:47 have a choice
46:49 this is where you use your adult powers
46:52 to
46:52 resist being turned into a slave a serf
46:56 to establish this class structure once
46:59 again
47:00 you know i went to school they used to
47:01 raise us the class structure
47:03 was one of the most acidic
47:07 things that ever happened to a modern
47:08 society and i've been
47:10 i've been re-watching this are you being
47:13 served
47:14 comedy which went from 1973 to 1983.
47:19 and uh part of the humor in this show
47:22 is class structure and the money python
47:25 did a lot of this a lot of british
47:26 schumer
47:27 got so sick and tired of it they also
47:30 wrote it into their systems and their in
47:32 their shows
47:34 but are you being served is a great way
47:35 to see it because you have the
47:38 the lowest worker with the you know the
47:40 janitors and the cleanup folks which
47:42 always had a powerful union so they
47:43 never got as screwed as everybody else
47:45 and then you had the floor walkers you
47:47 know the floor
47:49 mr peacock the guy ran the floor then he
47:50 had his upper management then the guy
47:52 owned the place
47:53 and each level cowered down to the next
47:56 level
47:57 it's just illustrated beautifully in
47:59 this series
48:01 which if you like goofy old uh british
48:04 humor it's it's a great series
48:06 but we're seeing it come back except
48:09 there's only two layers now
48:11 there's your your elite loyalists
48:16 people who are willing to destroy the
48:17 world and see it burn
48:19 because they're trapped inside their
48:21 baby body
48:23 and the rest of us and what's
48:26 interesting is
48:27 the integrity and high vibration people
48:30 are down here on the slave level and the
48:32 low vibration low iq traders
48:35 are at the top level
48:38 who has really sat around besides these
48:41 baby adults
48:42 if you're an adult when's the last time
48:45 you really went to bed at night hugged
48:47 your pillow and said
48:48 i am so glad that this politician's
48:52 there
48:53 right politicians have always been
48:56 corrupt
48:58 almost always right
49:01 the reason why you know you have
49:04 statues of people and monuments to
49:07 people cut in mountains is because those
49:09 are the few individuals that actually
49:12 had some integrity but we
49:16 aren't just individuals in backyards
49:18 making shows aren't we
49:21 we rely on the entire world to function
49:24 properly
49:25 otherwise we have to change our entire
49:27 way of life
49:29 think about it we get our food from
49:31 stores where the food is prepared
49:33 almost all the time even if it's just a
49:36 little raw tomato
49:38 that's grown in some fields somewhere
49:40 plucked shipped to you
49:41 you don't have to grow in your backyard
49:43 manicure your field
49:45 meats products that you use now we don't
49:49 need all the products that we use
49:50 but there are some products you gotta
49:51 have we have some clean water
49:54 okay we'll remove all the water that
49:56 you're buying and delivering where
49:57 you're going to get it
49:59 you have to use a dividing rod find a
50:01 water line
50:02 dig down to the mantle build a well
50:06 we rely on each other more and more
50:08 every single day
50:12 and so as we see the baby adults
50:16 get installed in political positions
50:19 because
50:19 the the absolute
50:23 psychopaths that run this world who
50:26 aren't baby adults
50:27 but they're extremely devious adults
50:31 they know they can get a bunch of yes
50:32 men and yes women out of these baby
50:34 adults who are looking for
50:36 a mother goose tell them what to do
50:40 they're just walking stockholm syndrome
50:42 prison cells
50:44 the mask is exactly their internal theme
50:47 of life
50:48 tell me what to do i want to know what
50:50 to do
50:52 well wear a mask make me happy the baby
50:55 adult
50:55 politician says because their
51:00 crazy narcissistic sociopathic leaders
51:03 tell them to tell their followers this
51:06 and
51:07 you know as we have been in this what we
51:10 call the great awakening
51:11 which has many facets you could be in
51:14 political great awakening being
51:16 conspiratorial wakings of all different
51:18 flavors right
51:20 we were sitting here thinking to
51:21 ourselves well
51:24 the um snowballs rolling downhill
51:27 and it seems like the awakening is
51:29 getting bigger and bigger and bigger and
51:30 it still is the case
51:32 but we were thinking that there were a
51:34 lot more
51:36 sort of trained individuals you know
51:39 if we were to think of it in a military
51:42 metaphor
51:43 you have you know your lodi lowly
51:45 corporal all the way up to your general
51:46 you have your navy seals and delta force
51:48 people who are just
51:50 experts at this and we have a lot of
51:53 people
51:54 who watch the show and participate in
51:56 the show's
51:57 maintenance who are absolutely the delta
51:59 force people
52:03 but when we were told over the telephone
52:07 that the world had a virus going around
52:11 okay with a 0.04 percent chance of death
52:15 for most healthy people and we were
52:18 we immediately allow ourselves to be
52:20 quarantined
52:22 we have our money taken away from us our
52:24 business is shut
52:28 they just walked right into it and
52:30 what's utterly ironic about the whole
52:32 thing
52:33 is that i've seen a bunch of adult
52:35 babies who own businesses
52:39 lose their businesses because they're
52:41 following the adult baby
52:43 propaganda i was just shown
52:46 right here on this patio a um
52:49 beautiful new restaurant that was built
52:52 and finished
52:53 about february this year in los angeles
52:56 probably one of the most beautiful
52:58 restaurants i've ever seen designed in
53:00 los angeles
53:01 i was just told by the person who showed
53:03 it to me they closed in the first
53:05 two weeks of operation and now they are
53:07 permanently out of business
53:09 everything's been liquidated restaurant
53:11 over
53:13 it's like cutting a hope diamond and
53:14 then smashing it on the ground
53:18 just after you're done
53:21 baby adults following baby adult rules
53:27 so is it better to be an adult
53:30 sure what's the difference in the two
53:32 lives
53:34 well one tends to perpetually lie to
53:37 themselves to keep a
53:39 fanciful fantasy lifestyle going
53:42 which is all made out of artificial
53:45 constructs of narcissism and the other
53:50 lives in reality and
53:53 probably has a few more scars that have
53:55 healed over
53:56 they've been bruised more maybe we've
53:58 had some broken bones metaphorically
54:02 but they think critically they're far
54:05 more in control of their life
54:07 and if that adult tells you that they're
54:10 happy
54:12 they're usually really happy and when
54:14 they're not happy
54:15 they'll let you know because they
54:17 realize the only way
54:18 out of this game if they're unhappy
54:21 is to communicate address the situation
54:24 and move on
54:26 there's never been a better point in
54:28 modern history
54:30 for man to assess man than 2020
54:33 it really isn't
54:36 for those of you who've been tracking a
54:38 lot of the human trafficking stuff
54:42 you know that there's a much more
54:44 important agenda going on right now than
54:46 wearing a mask for a common cold
54:50 i know what some of you might say well
54:52 this stuff killed my relative killed my
54:54 friend
54:54 maybe the way they're lying so much
54:57 around the world about what's causing
54:58 people's deaths you don't know
55:00 you don't know a friend of mine in the
55:03 midwest was
55:04 going to a local grocery store whatever
55:07 to buy stuff
55:08 came out to her car and found a woman
55:11 sobbing
55:13 just horribly and so naturally
55:16 being a good adult she walked over to
55:18 that person
55:20 and that person turned her and said my
55:22 uncle just died
55:24 of kobe
55:28 my friend called me and said god you
55:29 know it's like maybe he did
55:32 but there's a high chance he didn't uh
55:35 this woman was old
55:36 so her uncle must have been well within
55:39 his range of passing away naturally
55:42 without any you know method of
55:45 certifying anything who knows maybe he
55:48 did die
55:48 who knows the people die
55:53 but what they're trying to push at this
55:55 point
55:57 from the baby adult army of
56:00 politicians that are fighting for agenda
56:03 21
56:06 is to tell you that you that they
56:09 basically they're
56:10 anthropomorphizing a virus and saying
56:12 that virus has no
56:13 right to be in your body that virus has
56:15 no right to kill you
56:18 when the flu the common flu wipes out
56:21 over 360 000 people a year
56:24 cancer heart disease
56:27 eating wrong toxifying your body
56:30 allowing yourself to be really stressed
56:33 that's what kills you more than any of
56:35 this stuff you've never shut down the
56:37 world before
56:39 the interesting statistic that i can't
56:41 shake out of my brain is that in 2009
56:43 when h1n1 was spreading all over the
56:45 united states
56:46 just the united states itself
56:50 we had 60.8 million people infected with
56:54 h1n1 and we did not shut down
56:56 the world we did not shut down even the
56:58 united states we didn't shut down a
57:00 single
57:00 town or state well that's more than the
57:04 entire world's infection rate for coven
57:06 19 and we know that the test kit's 50
57:08 50.
57:09 we know that laboratories in in florida
57:13 have been inflating their numbers by 10
57:15 times 40 labs had to admit
57:17 they've been lying the entire time
57:20 why these people aren't in jail why that
57:22 isn't a
57:23 front page news don't know you can't
57:26 claim incompetency when you're screaming
57:28 fire in a theater fire
57:33 well uh oh and they take you outside man
57:35 there was any fire and like three people
57:36 got trampled to death because you yelled
57:38 that
57:39 what's up and today they go well i was
57:41 just looking at someone lighting a
57:43 lighter
57:44 in the back i just wanted to let
57:45 everybody know but i said it too loud so
57:47 it freaked everybody out
57:50 you're still going to jail man but not
57:53 with kovid you can lie all you want
57:56 one thing i've been saying for probably
57:58 the last two or three years especially
57:59 with the um
58:03 the letter movement online is that the
58:05 beautiful thing is if you've ever tried
58:08 to kill a cockroach
58:10 they hide they're brilliant oh every
58:12 insect does it
58:13 turn the lights on oh [ __ ] you know boom
58:15 they hide underneath
58:17 the appliance or whatever and you're
58:19 chasing it and they're constantly
58:21 running for shadows so as you're trying
58:22 to uncover this thing it's just going
58:24 under the next appliance the next
58:25 appliance right
58:28 nice thing is today cockroaches are all
58:31 out where we can see them
58:34 boy there's a lot of them isn't there
58:39 and now you know there's the um
58:43 sort of like the emperor having clothes
58:45 on story from a long time ago
58:49 what was that whole theme of that thing
58:51 right
58:53 the kid looks at the king and says he's
58:55 not wearing
58:57 clothes and the parents the baby adults
59:01 in that story said
59:02 shh he's got clothes on trying to force
59:06 the child to remove their ability to
59:08 think
59:08 and become like them serfs
59:11 slaves to acknowledge something that's
59:14 not actually occurring
59:15 because that makes the adults
59:18 uncomfortable that the child is actually
59:20 more of an adult than they are
59:23 and that's what we have today in 2020 in
59:26 groves right
59:29 now of course the kiss of death and the
59:32 algorithm
59:32 of trying to be an adult in a world of
59:35 baby adults
59:37 is that unless we can identify or i
59:40 should say
59:41 inject in society perhaps right through
59:43 the very means that they use to
59:46 to become the
59:49 evangelists of narcissism social media
59:53 if we can inject into their circles of
59:56 thought
59:57 memes or statements that that bring out
60:00 this
60:00 behavior and ridicule make it so easy to
60:04 understand that everyone's like
60:06 yeah you are baby what do you mean well
60:09 there's a little
60:10 thing right there maybe it's a couple
60:12 questions you ask well
60:13 are you a baby adult here's a bunch of
60:15 questions
60:17 yeah you failed the test or you passed
60:18 the test and now you are a baby adult
60:22 you get someone to see something they
60:24 can't unsee to think something they can
60:26 and
60:27 to be critical of themselves for the
60:29 first time
60:32 how many times have you seen those
60:33 hoarding shows
60:37 where you see cognitive dissonance
60:38 developed to a level that is absolutely
60:42 mentally ill in a lot of cases
60:45 irreversible
60:46 because these people hang on to their
60:49 disorder they don't even
60:50 see their disorder what blows me away is
60:54 that you'll see people um
60:56 and they're all different these
60:57 different episodes on that show called
60:58 hoarders
60:59 but you'll have a person in a home on a
61:02 strip of homes right
61:04 nice neighborhood man every neighborhood
61:07 every sorry every neighbor looks amazing
61:08 their yards are manicured
61:10 and their garage doors are open it's
61:12 beautiful inside you know
61:15 and then you have the hoarder house it's
61:17 got junk in the front yard junk in the
61:19 backyard stacked up 10 feet high
61:21 inside the homes are stacked as high as
61:23 they can stack trash
61:26 and no one's cleaned the toilet in years
61:29 you have a coleman oven and a pile of
61:32 newspapers
61:33 that they turn on every day to cook
61:34 their food they'll eat eggs that are
61:36 two years old you know i mean it's just
61:38 unbelievable
61:40 and they get these shows with these
61:41 hosts and psychologists that go in
61:43 sometimes they do miracles it is truly
61:46 an amazing thing when it goes right
61:48 but some people fight tooth and nail and
61:50 then the little biography
61:52 or a little epilogue afterwards is it
61:53 now they're still screwed you know
61:55 they're taking either therapy they're
61:56 still screwed they got their home
61:58 foreclosed or whatever
61:59 that's rare but it happens right but
62:02 these people will be pulled out in their
62:03 front yard well as all their stuff is
62:05 being categorized
62:06 for evaluation and they can see
62:09 the other homes but they're still
62:12 hoarding
62:13 because they're mentally ill mental
62:16 illness is a really strange thing in
62:18 that there is
62:21 certainly things that you can do to
62:23 prove that you're having a mental
62:24 episode
62:26 but a lot of times it's these little
62:28 nuances
62:30 and then we're also in a canceled
62:32 culture i always say
62:34 cancer culture either way it's good
62:37 and what is really the cancer culture
62:39 all about i did a whole episode about it
62:42 it's feeling too much and thinking too
62:44 little
62:46 you're not allowed to hurt people's
62:47 feelings
62:49 and on the surface that sounds great
62:51 right don't go around hurting people's
62:52 feelings that's doing harm
62:54 all right but it's become so ludicrous
62:57 now
62:58 that you have to have feelings for a
63:01 pedophile
63:03 you have to have feelings for a serial
63:05 rapist
63:06 you have to have feelings for a person
63:08 who home invades and kills the entire
63:10 family
63:12 was that george floyd's last crime was
63:14 holding a pregnant woman hostage in her
63:15 own house
63:18 the guy's painted all over the world now
63:19 as a mega hero
63:21 i'm not saying he should have died the
63:23 way he died he did resist the rest
63:25 didn't deserve to die for it let's be
63:28 careful where we place our hero worship
63:31 right
63:33 there's a lot of uh crazy killer
63:35 dictators that are on t-shirts
63:38 because it's cool i guess
63:42 we have taken it too far baby adults
63:47 don't have any compass they don't have
63:50 any thresholds in their minds
63:52 their world is built a fantasy to begin
63:53 with
63:55 so if it becomes more fantasy oriented
63:58 at the
63:58 cost and expense of everyone else's harm
64:03 they don't care because they can't
64:05 register it in their brain
64:07 they're mentally incapable which i think
64:10 would at least be
64:10 a good solid foot in the pool of
64:12 insanity
64:14 it goes right back to being a parent and
64:17 choosing to be a disciplinary
64:19 to keep your kid alive keep your kid
64:22 healthy
64:22 physically mentally and spiritually
64:27 or just saying whatever
64:30 you know raise yourself
64:34 the interesting thing is if you look at
64:35 celebrity children you will see this
64:38 in absolute droves man
64:41 the amount of rocker friends of mine
64:44 um some like one of my best friends has
64:47 two outstanding kids just amazing kids
64:49 just they built their lives beautifully
64:53 and i've got other rocker friends where
64:55 both their kids were
64:56 alcoholics before they were 16 years old
64:58 and i mean real
65:00 alcoholics right this is before a lot of
65:03 the social media was saying to really
65:05 become this
65:06 they just had no parent the parent was
65:08 on the road the whole time never making
65:09 a phone call
65:10 there's a hug missing you know there's
65:13 some discipline missing
65:16 because the parent as a rocker i will
65:18 tell you
65:19 the most amazing thing i learned by
65:22 hanging out with these rockers
65:23 is that few of them ever become adults
65:28 some do it beautifully but a few of them
65:30 they'll have like a 10-year
65:32 sort of retardation to their growth
65:36 they were slowed from their growth so
65:37 there's like let's say a guy
65:39 or a girl becomes a famous famous
65:41 musician from at the age of 18
65:44 and it doesn't quite turn off until
65:45 they're about 30.
65:47 you literally subtract 12 years
65:50 of the most formative years of any
65:52 person's life from 18 to 30.
65:54 most of us are learning how to deal with
65:56 life we're getting our butt kicked we're
65:58 getting
65:59 great jobs we're getting laid off having
66:00 to find new work having to educate
66:02 ourselves out of the one thing that
66:04 we're supposed to learn and learn it
66:05 better than everybody else because that
66:07 thing is no longer
66:08 even a factor in the world anymore and
66:11 we have to re-educate ourselves
66:14 we're dealing with a society where again
66:17 sabotaging a relationship is something
66:19 that you do
66:20 and then after you find out it's been
66:21 sabotaged you
66:23 completely you know destroy the
66:25 relationship
66:27 and then you're broken and you're angry
66:28 and you're cynical
66:30 and you go out you take all that energy
66:32 into the next relationship now you're
66:33 suspicious
66:35 you're projecting that bad energy and
66:37 attracting it to you so the next
66:38 relationship is the same exact
66:40 betrayal as the previous one you might
66:42 even be attracted to people that do this
66:44 kind of thing
66:45 without ever thinking about it right
66:47 what is the definition of insanity again
66:51 [Music]
66:52 that's what they got to understand about
66:53 europe europe
66:55 like i keep saying this is the theme i'm
66:57 going to keep repeating until next
66:58 season maybe you can take it in next
67:00 season
67:02 you have the de facto societal experts
67:05 on tyranny
67:06 monarchies class structure the
67:09 inquisition
67:10 telling your neighbor crap there's no
67:12 other place on earth
67:14 that has more history of that
67:18 abominable behavior than europe
67:21 and who's trying to tell the entire
67:23 world how to behave a particular way
67:26 2020 is caused by an agency
67:29 in europe yeah china had a problem
67:32 they dealt with it we should deal with
67:34 it they can choose to do whatever they
67:36 want in their economy country
67:38 we don't have to do it over here we've
67:39 never done it in the past but someone
67:41 made a phone call
67:42 from europe over to here a free country
67:44 with the first amendment and second
67:46 amendment in place
67:47 and we swallowed it why because baby
67:51 politicians
67:52 said to it's so bad that we found a cure
67:56 for this thing
67:57 we have for that instance that you might
68:00 have and catch it again of course
68:03 we found a cure works every time we
68:05 apply it to someone who isn't on the
68:07 absolute last few seconds of their life
68:09 come out of it and they're okay but you
68:12 have a political party going up for
68:14 their little convention here this week
68:16 telling you that it's crackpot science
68:19 when their techniques don't work
68:22 their techniques are they will ship you
68:25 off to an old folks home in uh new york
68:27 and
68:28 and then we'll deny the fact that you
68:29 die that we made a mistake doing that in
68:31 the first place even though it was
68:32 probably
68:33 totally intentional again
68:37 you wouldn't let a serial rapist watch
68:40 your kids
68:41 you wouldn't want we wouldn't let a
68:43 serial pedo watch your children
68:47 but letting europe tell the world how to
68:48 run is the exact same thing
68:52 the exact same thing
68:56 all the way back to the 70s in sitcoms
68:59 they've been trying to warn us about
69:02 these global organizations the united
69:04 nations
69:04 and again i told you about in the codex
69:07 elementary
69:08 episode how absolutely toxic the world
69:10 trade organization is how they're
69:11 poisoning all of our food
69:13 and making that the standard of the food
69:15 that we get
69:18 well one doesn't have to look further
69:19 than the fda in the cdc to realize that
69:22 those are corrupt organizations
69:23 appointed by
69:24 lobbyists to pass poisons into our
69:27 system
69:29 again the trick is to only kill you 20
69:32 years after they approved the drug
69:33 because then the people that approved it
69:35 in those agencies
69:36 are long gone and retired so that's all
69:39 they check in the clinical studies is
69:41 well
69:41 it's going to kill you but can we get it
69:43 to the 20-year mark
69:45 yes how certain are you that's going to
69:47 kill no sooners in 20 years
69:48 pretty certainly okay we prove it great
69:53 so you take it to 20 years old you're
69:55 dead at 42.
69:57 no one to sue i mean they've got money
70:00 now and the court's so rigged
70:02 that they just buy off the judges we're
70:04 seeing so many bought off judges
70:05 in 2020 it's crazy
70:08 so the worldwide world health
70:10 organization were you kidding me
70:12 that is a giant totally disconnected
70:14 organization not run
70:16 by a phd md we got a phd in something
70:19 else
70:20 not medicine of course which is why
70:21 we're in the situation we're in
70:25 so let me give you the closing analogy
70:26 here
70:29 all right if you go to a baby adult
70:33 and you say this thing that you're doing
70:36 is going to kill you
70:37 or or put you in a high risk
70:41 medical category of dying of anything
70:43 that's going around
70:46 and you say would you take it if they
70:48 told you to
70:49 a baby adult says well if they tell me
70:52 to yeah
70:53 because i believe in them even though
70:55 their record's horrible
70:57 i believe in them but you take an adult
71:01 and you push that same scenario on them
71:03 they're like hell no
71:05 that's why i don't vaccinate right why
71:07 would i put aluminum mercury in my body
71:09 why would i inject myself with the flu
71:12 that's alive
71:12 in the vaccine and then get the flu
71:16 for a week or two lose work lose all
71:18 your vacation
71:19 time when i can just skip it because
71:22 they're
71:23 chasing the wrong flu anyway in 20 years
71:25 in a row the cdc has approved the
71:27 vaccination for flu
71:28 but hasn't been addressing the one
71:30 that's been going around that's why in
71:32 2009
71:33 they had to quickly make a vaccine which
71:35 gave a bunch of people nerve damage
71:39 happened earlier in the 70s too
71:42 so let's just um take agenda 21.
71:47 for those of you are new to it it's not
71:49 a conspiracy it was signed by
71:51 over 150 countries in 1992 i believe
71:55 there's a woman named rosa corey you
71:57 have to go look up k-o-i-r-e
71:59 [Music]
72:02 and i am in communication with her for
72:03 those of you who want to know
72:08 their aboveboard playing when you go
72:11 look at their website
72:12 is you know sustainable living the green
72:15 new deal
72:17 which will make planes and possible cars
72:20 and possible boats impossible
72:22 all the power stations get shut down and
72:24 then hydroelectrics banned in america
72:26 so you'll be in huge just go back in the
72:28 stone ages right
72:30 all right but deep underneath they're
72:33 related documents they have a population
72:36 reduction plan
72:39 2030 is their goal 97
72:42 reduction of world population
72:46 sounds like the georgia guidestones
72:48 first commandment
72:50 okay so
72:54 you're wearing a mask because they told
72:55 you to
72:59 but their goal is to kill you off in 10
73:02 years
73:04 you think you're gonna be in the three
73:05 percent let's say that you
73:08 are the three percent you're the
73:10 fortunate three percent to be alive
73:12 after their little plan goes into fact
73:15 well the funny ironic thing is is that a
73:17 bunch of the baby adult politicians
73:19 who are ushering this through the system
73:21 think that they're going to get a
73:23 pass and the
73:26 little catch 22 with that theory is that
73:29 those who run the world
73:30 want the traitors dead first so all the
73:33 baby adults backstabbing their own
73:35 populations to kill them off
73:37 who think they're getting this special
73:39 pass to live in that three percent
73:41 they're going to be exterminated because
73:43 they can't be trusted
73:44 because they threw their own kind under
73:46 the bus
73:49 but do you really want to be in the
73:50 three percent let's think about it
73:54 as bill gates laughed off in his
73:56 interview oh well you're definitely
73:57 going to notice the second wave
74:00 a pre-planned virus that the bill and
74:02 melinda gates foundation
74:04 must already have knowledge about
74:07 whether they created it or not who knows
74:10 but they know that there's a more deadly
74:12 one coming and if we don't do what they
74:13 say they're going to literally release
74:15 this weapon
74:16 on the world then we really will have to
74:20 stay inside the masks will never do
74:21 anything
74:22 ever okay you have to have a big
74:25 industrial mask okay
74:27 it's got less than a 0.125 micrometer
74:31 hole
74:32 or filtration system probably an oxygen
74:35 tank seriously
74:36 but let's say one morning they've
74:39 released whatever is going to do this 97
74:41 reduction because it's not going to be
74:42 just a vaccination it's going to be
74:45 something released okay they're going to
74:48 do all the same tricks they did with
74:49 this first thing which is to hide it
74:51 let it spread all over the place then
74:54 it's like that little game that you can
74:56 play on your phone it's uh
74:58 i forgot what's called like it's not
75:00 pandemic but it's something like that
75:02 isn't ironic that game came out
75:05 simulated a bunch of wins
75:06 into the ai big machine learning so they
75:08 know how to release this thing and its
75:10 maximum potential
75:12 what a brilliant thing really so it's
75:14 like a last starfighter
75:15 they released the arcade game in this
75:18 movie
75:19 to find the best star fighters in the
75:20 world and this one kid in a rural town
75:22 in the middle of the desert was the best
75:23 in the world and so they came and picked
75:25 him up and made him a starfighter
75:26 to help them fight their war that's a
75:29 hero tail
75:30 this is an evil tale kids who got really
75:32 good at this little iphone app
75:34 trained a big machine learning algorithm
75:39 to find the best way to disseminate the
75:42 most lethal virus on planet earth
75:43 killing off
75:44 easily 97 but you wake up and people are
75:49 dying
75:50 and you're wondering what the hell is
75:51 going on because we never address
75:53 chemtrails
75:55 they just spray it on top of you what do
75:57 you do it's going to come into your
75:58 house
75:58 because you have a massive filtration
76:00 system and what are you going to do turn
76:02 into an absolute weirdo
76:04 no chances are wherever they spray ain't
76:07 no one gonna live
76:09 but let's just say you had immunity
76:10 you're one of those walking dead folks
76:12 that have immunity
76:13 all right now you're walking dead great
76:16 you're walking around
76:18 and there's just bodies everywhere
76:21 rotting and there's not enough people to
76:23 come pick up 97 percent
76:25 so just gonna sit there and they're
76:27 gonna rot yes would be some
76:30 some uh people have been getting some
76:33 inoculation
76:34 they're going to be wearing these hazmat
76:35 suits maybe cleaning up a few regions of
76:37 washington dc
76:38 or wherever these people want to live
76:41 putting them in those little fema
76:42 coffins
76:42 bearing them off somewhere all right
76:46 but then what's the life you're gonna
76:48 live because all these resources that
76:50 you're so used to are gone now
76:53 if you didn't die from the virus you
76:54 might die from the lack of people
76:56 providing you food and water
76:59 electricity unless you're ted nugent
77:02 you can hunt with a bow and arrow and
77:04 live in the woods soul life
77:07 don't know
77:11 so when you think about how important it
77:13 is not to become a surf right now
77:16 in life a slave to these baby adults
77:19 that's how important it is
77:23 you know this show is airing in 2020
77:27 a lot of people will hear the show and
77:28 you'll mention it to friends
77:30 imagine i don't know maybe they get
77:34 their dream in
77:35 2028 and you are
77:38 you come out of your front door and
77:40 you've heard this show and you've heard
77:41 all my other talk about agenda 21
77:46 and you start seeing it and in the
77:48 middle of this horrible chaos
77:51 you might just chuckle and go wow it was
77:54 right
77:55 this was real and i just blew it off
77:58 because i thought it was so outrageous i
78:00 couldn't conceive of it
78:02 thus i didn't think it was possible to
78:04 occur and here we are
78:07 and you realize that if you start having
78:10 problems breathing
78:12 a few minutes you're going to be laying
78:13 down in your bedroom or your front room
78:15 or on your doorstep
78:18 just like everyone else you just saw if
78:21 you happen to survive
78:22 and you get through the starvation phase
78:26 you got a plan up to a point well
78:28 eventually you're going to get you
78:31 eventually maybe if you're first
78:33 generation gen 21 maybe you can go hide
78:35 somewhere in some foreign country and
78:37 not get caught but eventually they'll
78:40 repopulate enough
78:41 they'll deploy those boston dynamic
78:44 robots to either exterminate you
78:45 or incarcerate you then you're going to
78:48 live in one of these concentration camp
78:50 cities
78:52 then what every bedroom in your house is
78:55 videotaped like
78:56 thx1138 robot cops are telling you what
79:00 to do
79:02 well i'm so glad you lived right now
79:04 you're going to have a living hell
79:06 especially if you have a semblance in
79:08 your mind of freedom
79:10 which i think every human does
79:12 regardless if they're in baby adult
79:13 phase or not
79:16 it doubles and triples and quadruples an
79:18 exponential realization that you're in a
79:24 so it's important in my opinion that we
79:27 exterminate this disease
79:29 that is baby adult syndrome however we
79:32 can try to be clever
79:34 create a meme create a saying something
79:37 you can
79:38 something you rehearse and you take into
79:41 account all the demographics and
79:43 people that you would ever utter this to
79:48 and start spreading the news man
79:52 because it's your life too because we
79:54 all rely on each other as much as we
79:56 want to hide in our bedrooms at night or
79:58 whatever some people are just
79:59 staying in their homes they still rely
80:01 on the electricity
80:02 on the food on whatever to survive
80:06 you know i think you feel me
80:11 so this is a little uh annexed episode
80:15 still working on the season six stuff
80:17 it's uh it's a ton of stuff man
80:20 but i've got what i need i know i just
80:22 need to do a lot of shooting and all
80:24 that kind of stuff it's gonna take a
80:26 little while
80:27 i'll keep these coming out once a week
80:28 at least i thank you for your patience
80:32 and if you haven't been to
80:32 deepthoughtsradio.com please go that's
80:34 where all the links are i just had a
80:36 listener ask me where the cern episode
80:37 was
80:38 and that is in the season one link
80:40 that's on the front of the web page
80:41 just remember the search fields on the
80:43 front of the website
80:45 you just typed in cern that person would
80:47 have found in two seconds
80:48 so that's your friend we have two
80:51 reliable video sources
80:52 we have four social media two most
80:55 important
80:55 are well actually the only one that's
80:57 actually important is the
80:59 locked facebook page if you happen to
81:01 have a facebook account
81:02 it's a great place to go for like-minded
81:04 people just like you
81:07 i do do some twittering but i hate the
81:09 platform because it's just pure hatred
81:11 all over the place
81:12 this is not healthy for your soul man so
81:15 i don't recommend it
81:18 like i said there's a season one link
81:19 there's a store i ended up finding out
81:22 that the i like ufo shirt somehow fell
81:24 out of the store
81:25 which was the most popular shirt so
81:28 highly recommend
81:29 if you want to grab that grab it and
81:32 other than that there's a couple ways to
81:34 donate to the page if you want to
81:36 support
81:36 patreon is always there thank you so
81:38 much for everyone who's partnered with a
81:40 few bucks during this crazy crazy phase
81:42 i know that's a scary thing even a
81:44 dollar out of your pockets
81:46 potentially uh running a risk on your
81:49 side so i appreciate it
81:51 and then paypal for just a direct link
81:53 so
81:54 when you do donate you you get into the
81:57 um
81:58 the inner circle where you can get these
81:59 episodes before they air
82:01 uh there's not a lot of lead time for
82:03 summer episodes but definitely while the
82:05 season is going i'm
82:06 cranking out episodes three or four a
82:08 week and so they're always in the buffer
82:10 you can get them for two or three days
82:12 before everybody else so that's kind of
82:13 fun and you get in the credits
82:15 if you do not want to be in the credits
82:17 just let me know and i won't put you in
82:18 there
82:19 so far only one person is requested to
82:21 be taken out of the credits
82:23 so on that note take care of yourself
82:26 and someone else and i'll see you in the
82:28 next deep thoughts
82:29 over now
82:39 [Applause]
82:46 [Applause]
82:52 [Applause]
83:09 you
