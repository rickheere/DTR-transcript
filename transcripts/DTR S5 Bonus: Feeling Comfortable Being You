00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen
00:35 okay today's episode is about
00:38 um obviously you've seen the title
00:43 it's about fearing being who you are
00:46 or being yourself and it kind of dawned
00:50 on me that that's exactly
00:52 one of the biggest problems we have on
00:54 this planet
00:58 is that uh it came
01:02 from a huge change
01:05 that marshall mcloone was trying to tell
01:07 us about
01:10 medium is the message right
01:15 so my whole life i've been
01:19 i think pretty much exactly who i wanted
01:21 to be whenever
01:22 i wanted to be it
01:26 and i think it's because i had no
01:28 brothers or sisters
01:30 pushing me around
01:33 i think that the only older person in my
01:37 life
01:37 at a youthful range was
01:41 a cousin of mine and he was so
01:44 you know people have to be cooler than
01:47 you or someone you would look up to
01:49 before you're gonna change who you are
01:53 so my only input
01:55 to decide who i was going to be which
01:57 didn't happen until later
02:00 was probably a movie
02:03 not sure there's any television show i
02:04 can put put my finger on before
02:08 i don't even know if that's ever
02:09 happened definitely movies though
02:11 heroes right but i mean how much can you
02:14 emulate that kind of thing
02:16 but that's me let's generalize this
02:18 thing
02:20 let's think about two different kids
02:24 they're going to be about 150 years
02:26 apart from each other
02:28 let's say one kid is in 1870
02:31 on a plane in kansas and the other dudes
02:34 in 2020
02:36 in the heart of any major city in the
02:38 world
02:40 let's do los angeles since i lived next
02:42 to los angeles
02:45 so the kid in the 1870s let's do him
02:47 first
02:49 regardless if he has brothers or sisters
02:52 he's on a little prairie
02:56 farm with a house he's got duties
03:02 and he doesn't have a lot of people
03:04 around him
03:06 other than his family there's no tv
03:10 there's no radio
03:13 maybe a telegram comes in every once in
03:15 a while but that's actually
03:17 an extremely rare thing for a family in
03:19 in those
03:20 settings
03:23 what's their life like let's get up in
03:26 the morning
03:28 go take care of all the animals make
03:31 sure
03:31 everything's fed uh you usually can get
03:35 some animals out depending on what the
03:36 season is
03:39 and then you probably have to go farm
03:42 work the crops uh depending on what time
03:47 of year it is the kid will have to go to
03:48 school depending on how old he is
03:50 well she's a boy but this is generic
03:54 right across the board except for
03:55 females do get more attacked
03:57 in the current 2020 scenario so we'll
03:59 duel over
04:00 as well
04:03 but the kid is is experiencing this the
04:06 necessities of life within a
04:08 team atmosphere which is the family
04:13 i think most of you know that families
04:15 that used to farm
04:16 used to have lots of kids and the goal
04:19 is to create little workers
04:21 and to populate the country of course
04:25 which you know at that point in time we
04:27 were pretty much the
04:28 invaders from europe now
04:32 the kid grows up just keeps growing up
04:35 growing up
04:37 but those formative 10 years for sure
04:40 are going to be
04:43 a regimented loop of work
04:46 learn work sleep repeat
04:51 of course when the kid hits his teen
04:52 years he's going to be looking at some
04:54 girl at school
04:55 some girl you know down this down the
04:57 road
04:59 it's gonna be a lot of effort to get
05:00 around there's no cars
05:03 it's horseback or walking
05:06 and in terms of forming any image of
05:09 himself
05:11 it's going to be based on what life is
05:13 about
05:16 how much time would that kid have to be
05:18 derailed
05:19 from perhaps his parents upbringings
05:22 which are going to spread through the
05:23 family depending on if he's the 10th
05:25 child or the first child
05:28 not a whole lot maybe the kid maybe
05:32 would go into town to get a little uh
05:34 sort of
05:35 western fictional book about something
05:38 but even that
05:39 really didn't come around by the 1870s
05:42 you need to kind of get through the 70s
05:44 to get all your dodge city
05:45 tombstone all those wild stories
05:50 firms as far as the world news he
05:52 doesn't have any
05:53 his parents don't have any you know i'm
05:56 sure if dad's in
05:58 the hardware store or the grocery
06:04 there'll be someone saying something
06:05 about who's president who's running
06:07 you'd hear this the law's coming
06:10 we bought this giant piece of land that
06:13 might be
06:14 folded into the the colonies
06:17 but overall the kids by himself with his
06:20 family's influence
06:22 carrying down the family traditions
06:25 in a female sense that might be in
06:28 addition to everything the boy is doing
06:31 and hopefully the boys learning how to
06:33 build a barn he's learning how to plow a
06:35 field
06:35 he's learning the mechanisms that a man
06:37 has to
06:40 command in order to run a family
06:43 the girls will get a little bit more
06:44 arts and crafts back in those days
06:47 they'd carry down all the recipes
06:49 of the family which are absolute gems
06:53 they're probably making amending
06:55 clothing
06:57 things like that all of it good all of
07:00 it fun
07:02 they're all raising each other right so
07:04 let's say the kid's the first born out
07:05 of ten
07:06 well he's gonna be literally holding his
07:09 brothers and sisters feeding them
07:11 taking care of them if he's the middle
07:13 kid he's just swamped he's got five over
07:16 and four under now let that sink in for
07:20 just a second
07:22 he's undisturbed therefore
07:26 if the family has their act together
07:27 that kid and all of his brothers and
07:29 sisters
07:30 also have a very high likelihood of
07:33 having their act together
07:35 trade skills important trade skills that
07:37 actually
07:38 feed the family that nurture the land
07:41 keep them warm in the winter and cool in
07:44 the summer
07:46 oh sure they play and they do all those
07:48 kind of things
07:50 with 10 kids they might get 10 cakes a
07:53 year maybe
07:54 this couple kids are close in age
08:12 hopefully without me even going to 2020
08:15 the nightmare of today
08:17 it's interfering with both young
08:20 people and older people trying to deal
08:23 with who they are
08:25 is starting to become really evident so
08:28 that kid is
08:29 looking at a reflective surface if they
08:32 even have one
08:33 he's trying to decide who he is is it
08:36 even a question
08:39 i'm gonna guess not much he's just who
08:42 he is
08:42 he just has the directives that he has
08:47 now i got sort of a 100 year upgrade to
08:50 that
08:51 where i grew up in a really small town
08:53 and you know
08:54 everything was about the town the town
08:56 itself was physically endearing
08:58 the people were amazing because
09:00 everybody was in check
09:02 you weren't a jerk anywhere because if
09:04 you were a jerk
09:06 well you you get corrected
09:09 you have problems getting service people
09:11 talk about you your buddies might come
09:13 over and go what's wrong man
09:15 but i honestly i didn't hear about much
09:17 of those scenarios in my hometown at all
09:21 now let's fast forward
09:25 100 i guess 50 years right
09:29 kid is born in 2020.
09:32 now we can ignore some
09:36 of the stuff that's going on specific to
09:38 this year
09:39 to make our point
09:43 now we're also going to infer backwards
09:45 for those of you who are older if you
09:47 can hear my voice you weren't born
09:48 yesterday
09:51 but think about it
09:54 as soon as the smartphone came out as
09:56 soon as a tablet came out
09:59 parents just give these things to their
10:01 kids to shut them up
10:04 kids are born in a chaotic
10:08 hurricane of messages
10:11 and parents don't seem to understand
10:13 that their kids actually get the
10:14 messages
10:16 that you know a ton of the listeners on
10:18 this show reported in
10:19 they get it i encourage you to be as
10:22 much like them as you possibly can
10:28 you know it used to be that when i was a
10:30 kid my father
10:31 went to work earned a paycheck came home
10:33 and all the bills got paid
10:36 and then over you know second and third
10:39 decade of my life
10:40 well the two income household was
10:43 created
10:44 to tax the other half of the population
10:46 as tony rockefeller told aaron russo
10:49 not to give women their rights
10:53 like i've said in several shows recently
10:56 it's always good to remember
10:58 that being a mother was demonized being
11:00 a mother was
11:02 you know the the cliches of barefoot and
11:04 pregnant went out
11:06 make me a sandwich everything that
11:08 insults being a wife
11:10 being a mother was being insulted and
11:14 people buy it
11:16 people buy it men buy it women buy it
11:19 and so going out working for a
11:21 corporation and being a slave is the
11:24 awesome
11:24 big win it's what man has been trying to
11:26 get rid of in his life
11:28 since the beginning that's why men try
11:30 to you know and women now of course
11:33 um go towards entrepreneurship
11:36 everybody regardless of what gender you
11:38 are once out of the game as soon as you
11:40 get in the game
11:41 because you realize you have no control
11:44 you could do bet much better than
11:45 everyone else at your work and you never
11:47 get a bonus you never get a
11:49 disproportionate raise up over the
11:51 person that's not doing a job good job
11:53 at all
11:56 and we're going to go on the outside of
11:57 the onion and then go
11:59 in right the you being yourself is going
12:02 to be the second stage
12:03 but without understanding the climate
12:05 that you live in
12:07 it might seem to be a bit of a mystery
12:12 but what does it mean to be yourself
12:15 it means you're making choices should it
12:17 be this way you should be that way
12:20 well you have to come back out to the
12:21 outside of the onion
12:24 because it's all about your influences
12:25 it's all about
12:27 how many voices would you say if every
12:30 page on your phone was this was an
12:32 individual voice meaning every
12:33 individual article that you read
12:35 even if it's just the headline is is a
12:37 unique voice
12:39 every radio program you hear
12:42 television show people talking
12:46 if that's all a unique voice how many
12:49 voices would you say you hear in a day
12:52 even someone repeating what someone else
12:54 said because they watch tv a lot
12:57 well those voices are just being passed
12:58 to you
13:00 it clouds anyone's ability
13:05 to choose who the hell they are
13:09 you know candy vending machines have
13:11 been around for a really really long
13:12 time right
13:15 and what's really interesting is i
13:17 remember being a kid and not just being
13:19 you know like visiting willy wonka's
13:22 wall
13:23 just looking inside of any machine all
13:25 these choices
13:28 and i thought i had a tremendous amount
13:29 of choices in the 70s
13:32 but you go to a fully stocked vending
13:34 machine in the 20s 2020
13:36 and it's like that times four
13:40 there's so much stuff in the machine
13:41 you're like oh my god you go into
13:42 anxiety in fact there was the guy from i
13:44 think friday's
13:46 used to create these weird words it was
13:48 part of his little show
13:50 and he created a word for that that
13:51 anxiety you get when you're trying to
13:53 pick what you want in the machine
13:56 it's so true isn't it
14:00 so before there's any pressure to be one
14:02 way or the other
14:03 the sheer number of choices as dictated
14:05 by voices
14:08 very propagandized voices voices with
14:12 agendas voices with narratives voices
14:14 with goals
14:17 well they're like a chorus of chaos
14:22 no one is singing in the same key
14:25 and so it just sounds like absolute
14:28 static in our minds
14:30 and then there is sort of a
14:34 of subdermal influence which is
14:37 not a voice necessarily but an action
14:39 something you're seeing
14:43 do you wear a mask or don't you no one
14:46 has to necessarily tell you before
14:47 you're gonna start feeling the pressure
14:51 when you go to a beach how do you behave
14:52 when you drive a car how do you behave
14:54 when you go to dinner in public how do
14:56 you behave
14:58 now some people don't notice anything
15:00 right they have
15:01 22 kids they go to a restaurant at nine
15:04 o'clock at night
15:05 and they're they've just they've they've
15:07 screwed too much they've had too many
15:08 kids and then they just let the
15:10 restaurant be a playground destroying
15:11 everyone else's experience
15:14 and that's a little vibration person
15:17 can't do much about that believe me they
15:19 probably are who they want to be
15:21 not want to be but they're who they are
15:23 you know
15:25 i see people struggle
15:29 trying and i've seen this my entire life
15:32 and i've never understood personally
15:35 anything more than the mechanic the
15:38 academic mechanic of peer pressure
15:42 meaning i know what it is i mean i know
15:44 what what they say it is
15:47 but and you do have the inverse person
15:52 and it could be dangerous being inverse
15:54 person which is
15:56 that person that says you can't tell me
15:58 what to do
16:00 and they are the specimen that invented
16:05 reverse psychology
16:09 a low vibration person will let
16:12 peer pressure get to them but a low
16:14 vibration person will also be
16:16 even i think more dangerous than the
16:18 person that can't make a decision or is
16:20 letting everyone tell them what to do
16:22 the person that says i you can't tell me
16:25 what to do
16:27 well you just tell them what you don't
16:29 want them to do and
16:30 they'll go do the opposite and so you
16:32 can guide them right where you want them
16:36 this is how coups
16:39 that turn into civil wars happen you
16:42 tell a group of people
16:44 what to do you tell them who they are
16:47 you make them victims
16:49 and they get all upset because inside
16:51 you can just see their anger
16:54 and they have legitimate reasons
16:55 sometimes to be angry
16:58 i think everyone has a reason to be
17:00 angry in this world today about
17:01 something
17:03 some common law things being broken
17:05 against them yeah
17:07 and so if you just poke a little hole
17:09 and you let
17:10 the air come out
17:14 you might get them to be in control like
17:17 what if they go to a great
17:18 comedy show they see a good movie or
17:20 they go on vacation or they go to
17:22 disneyland or something
17:23 and they replenish in their soul the
17:25 fuel of goodness
17:27 whatever your definition is
17:30 well then you can exude what you put in
17:33 a lot of times those little refueling
17:36 stops
17:36 are uh
17:40 not enough it's just a little tiny
17:44 droplet it gets spent really really fast
17:49 we have this
17:52 genius this prime directive within us
17:58 that developed from a prehistoric
18:02 setting that is the driving force behind
18:06 anyone that is contemplating whether or
18:09 not to care about what someone else
18:10 thinks about them
18:11 thus allowing someone else to mold them
18:14 or
18:14 to perhaps conflict with what they would
18:17 truly want to be
18:20 and that is the tribalism
18:25 instinct in man
18:28 i don't think any of us besides maybe
18:31 some military trained people or some
18:33 preppers have taken that kind of
18:36 survivalistic training
18:38 really have a warm fuzzy about being
18:40 pushed in the middle of a forest
18:42 to live pushed into a desert a plane
18:46 a mountain whatever because you know
18:50 that what you would need to live
18:51 is a tremendous effort every single day
18:55 if you don't have grocery stores
18:57 and doctors and so
19:02 we've seen it we've seen the horror in
19:04 our past
19:06 of people that were kicked out of the
19:07 village and we know and then just like a
19:10 few hours later we hear a
19:11 a tiger or a lion or a bear just eat
19:14 them alive in the
19:15 in the forest and that blood curdling
19:18 scream
19:19 and all the death and lady you find
19:22 their body
19:23 you're like oh my god it was traumatic
19:26 to see their face when they got kicked
19:27 out it was traumatic when they got eaten
19:28 up it's traumatic
19:31 that i found them and you don't want to
19:33 be that person
19:36 and just that primal instinct that's
19:37 been installed into man
19:39 over however many tens of thousands
19:42 hundreds of thousands millions of years
19:43 of evolution
19:45 or design keeps us in check
19:51 and so taken to the extreme
19:54 we can go with the flow
19:59 and one of the reasons i want to make
20:00 this episode is that i met a guy who
20:02 makes a business out of it
20:03 but within himself that's my little
20:05 phrase for it
20:06 he is so industrialized ass kissing in
20:09 his life
20:11 that he's no longer himself he's kind of
20:13 a
20:14 what i would say to be sort of a useless
20:16 copy of bad
20:18 doctrine and he's the kind of guy
20:22 that if you sat down and you let's say
20:24 that you were
20:25 an investigative intelligence officer
20:28 you have physically
20:29 seen things with your own eyes
20:33 that are horrific all this crazy stuff
20:35 going on in the world
20:36 you've seen it you've seen anthony
20:38 weiner's insurance folder
20:40 you've been on a plane with kentrell
20:42 chemicals being loaded
20:44 and you've heard the debriefing about it
20:47 you went to nasa and were fully
20:48 debriefed that the moon missions didn't
20:50 occur
20:51 on and on and on and then you sit down
20:53 with this guy
20:56 who doesn't really want to hear anything
20:58 that you have to say what he wants to do
21:00 is fight away his own fear his own
21:03 cowardice
21:05 because what he chose to be was safe
21:10 and instead of disliking the process
21:13 he made a business out of it within
21:15 himself it's what turns him on
21:18 is to say oh man i'm not like those
21:20 crazy people
21:22 i'm totally centered and functional
21:26 when in the end he's an empty carcass
21:30 with a mouth right
21:34 just had this experience dude was uh
21:38 immediately trying to separate himself
21:40 from me
21:42 and trying to put me down inside his
21:44 feeble mind and he was like well you
21:46 know he's
21:47 you're one of those conspiracy theorists
21:49 all of you have experienced it
21:52 it was a faux methodology for his feeble
21:55 mind
21:55 to take a step over yours or over mine
22:01 like i said in the low vibration episode
22:03 i said
22:04 there's a lot of people believe the
22:05 world is flat and
22:07 a lot of folks that have never done any
22:09 research ever
22:12 will make fun of those people and this
22:14 guy did it this guy did it
22:16 he kept trying to throw out more and
22:18 more extremes to try and lock me down in
22:20 something i believed
22:21 so that he could say oh my god you
22:23 believe in that
22:25 trying to take his feeble perception of
22:28 himself which is way inside of his
22:30 character in his id
22:31 and jack it up that day going home most
22:35 likely with a very empty
22:36 form of satisfaction that he
22:42 basically outclassed the information
22:43 that i was bringing
22:45 by way of just randomly meeting him
22:48 and i just kept sitting there looking at
22:50 the guy just thinking
22:52 you have chosen to be this person out of
22:55 sheer
22:56 fear of being perhaps
22:59 actually intelligent
23:02 he doesn't want to get out of there you
23:04 know he's probably got a comfy life with
23:05 whatever circle
23:06 is and what was funny is no matter how
23:09 much science i dumped on this guy no
23:11 matter how much i interrogated his
23:14 lack of science he would have to
23:17 constantly admit in our conversation
23:19 yeah i don't know anything about that
23:21 and i'd say well i know a hell of a lot
23:23 about that
23:24 professionally in some cases
23:27 it didn't matter it didn't matter if i
23:30 was a nuclear physicist
23:32 and he had never heard of the word he
23:35 was still
23:36 more of a physicist than i was and it's
23:39 just a
23:39 fictitious example but you get what i'm
23:42 saying
23:44 right now we have in 2020
23:49 a bunch of these people that were raised
23:53 on cell phones raised on tv
23:56 i mean remember cable guy remember
24:00 ben stiller's cable guy with jim carrey
24:03 matthew broderick
24:06 and cage you know why that movie is
24:10 considered
24:11 a comedy and for those of you didn't see
24:14 it's about a
24:15 character that was raised by a tv
24:17 because his mother was constantly
24:19 going out on dates and then he's really
24:22 a weird guy
24:24 it's a comedy because the tv raised this
24:27 guy
24:29 but it's no longer a comedy in 2020
24:32 because that's exactly
24:33 how most parents raise their children
24:36 watch the tv
24:36 shut up here's your phone don't you have
24:38 your cell phone isn't it
24:39 here's my there's my tablet and they'll
24:41 take pictures of their children
24:44 on these devices some of them have
24:46 educational games going so
24:48 that's actually not a bad thing if
24:49 you're controlling the content more
24:51 power to you
24:53 a lot of times the kids are just out
24:54 there surfing around
24:57 imagine dad's uh internet history
25:00 coming up in front of a four-year-old
25:03 but now it's become a little more
25:05 insidious than that hasn't it
25:08 used to be that it was
25:11 we thought for ourselves like the
25:14 prairie kid
25:16 life simply dictated needs and you
25:18 followed up
25:19 with methodologies of becoming the
25:21 person male or female
25:23 that would fill those needs and because
25:26 those needs and those models were built
25:28 up over
25:30 again tens of thousands of years the
25:33 nuclear family was an amazing thing
25:35 people enjoy nuclear families they enjoy
25:37 their mothers and fathers getting along
25:39 and being in the same household
25:41 because they're not financially stressed
25:43 they're not ingesting everyone else's
25:45 problems 24 7.
25:47 they're not arguing over politics or
25:49 religion
25:51 they just got along it's a beautiful
25:52 place i lived in those places i lived in
25:55 a world where that was
25:56 98 of the scenario in the town
26:00 if not higher then it was sort of
26:05 a step up slowly it was
26:08 we want you to desire things so we're
26:11 going to create marketing departments
26:12 the
26:13 most fundamental conspiracy group in the
26:16 world
26:16 against humanity is a marketing
26:18 department trying to get you to buy
26:19 something you don't need
26:21 over someone else's product that you
26:23 don't need who also has a marketing
26:25 department
26:27 you can't just be left to choice it's
26:29 got to be a
26:30 marketing thing people run for office
26:33 through pr firms which are an upper
26:37 level human marketing team
26:39 trying to get you to believe in someone
26:41 that may or may not have your best
26:43 interests
26:44 but they know whether or not there's
26:46 something that you don't like and they
26:47 hide that
26:49 and they blow smoke or the sun don't
26:52 shine to make you believe something that
26:54 you
26:55 do want give you a case in point
26:59 i believe it was 2016 where veritas
27:01 stung but it might have been 18 i'm not
27:03 quite sure
27:03 the veritas stunned a woman running for
27:06 the governor of missouri
27:08 and she was trying to play a moderate
27:11 she knows that missouri loves guns and
27:13 let me tell you they love guns
27:15 oh my gosh they got the big ones
27:19 and so she kept telling everyone oh i
27:22 would never go after the second
27:23 amendment that's what makes me different
27:25 from my
27:25 party all right well it would have been
27:28 nice if that was really her stance
27:30 but project veritas got into her
27:32 campaign
27:33 and dude filmed a bunch of hipsters
27:36 running her
27:37 campaign he says uh what is our stance
27:39 on second amendment
27:40 oh she's gonna get rid of the guns
27:41 automatically she's just lying to them
27:44 about keeping their guns
27:47 she's gone that video aired missouri
27:51 stomped her out like a like a lit coal
27:55 but a pr firm taught her how to lie
27:59 it happens to be called the dnc in that
28:00 particular realm
28:03 but by the time i was a kid you know you
28:07 start getting uh
28:08 tiny agendas very very testy kind of
28:11 agendas coming in the late 70s by you
28:13 know
28:14 the midwest anyway maybe in new england
28:16 it was way more intense
28:19 but fast forward 30 years
28:22 and you now have groups
28:25 trying to program your children to be
28:28 absolutely and utterly confused about
28:30 who they are as a human being
28:33 trying to tell your children that they
28:34 do not have two
28:37 genders there's two
28:40 biologically provable and a court of law
28:42 now you can be mentally ill and be
28:45 and identify as a tiger person or
28:48 a ninja turtle or whatever you can
28:50 surgically alter your face to be
28:52 whatever the hell you want
28:54 that's your choice again not harming me
28:57 do no harm good we're all thumbs up
29:00 there
29:01 lgbt is obviously linked to this
29:05 non-gender thing
29:09 really two girls like two girls
29:12 okay there's your l two boys like two
29:15 boys
29:16 there's your g b
29:20 you like either one b
29:24 t well you like to dress usually it's a
29:26 man dressing like a woman
29:30 if you uh identify as something else
29:33 well
29:34 you typically are a guy identifying as a
29:36 girl a girl identifying as a guy you
29:38 feel like you have that in your soul
29:40 you're still acknowledging just two
29:41 genders and you get all lgbt together
29:44 there you go we're good you got h
29:47 for the rest of us lgbt for everybody
29:49 else
29:51 but now it's like if you want to wear
29:55 a unicorn outfit all day long they
29:57 create a gender for that
29:58 a gender
30:02 programming but it gets more insidious
30:06 than that
30:09 every human being i've been saying on
30:10 the show forever has a right of passage
30:13 moment
30:15 if you're a boy you're to take over for
30:18 your father's decision-making process
30:23 the way that you work the rite of
30:25 passage is first from the primal
30:27 animals that we still see to this day i
30:30 think monkeys are pretty good for us
30:32 apes or whatever apes let's do apes
30:35 well dad's in charge dad made you he's
30:38 the alpha male
30:40 gorilla whatever okay well eventually
30:43 you got to knock the old man out
30:44 well he's your dad what happens when you
30:47 knock out den
30:49 well you get to have a bunch of inbred
30:50 sex with your sisters and maybe even
30:52 your mom
30:53 right the oedipus complex right there in
30:56 the jungle right in front of your face
30:58 freud was just simply putting it in
31:02 easier terms
31:03 maybe not even easier terms but
31:04 different terms so you can understand on
31:06 the human level
31:08 same thing with the lionesses they have
31:11 to fight
31:11 to get the male to impregnate them they
31:14 have a desire it's built in them
31:18 so every teenage boy and every teenage
31:20 girl
31:22 i probably do this at four i don't know
31:24 but there's a rite of passage where you
31:26 push it all out and you're like i am
31:28 smart enough to at least make these
31:29 basic decisions that are governing my
31:31 existence
31:32 we're not doing anything super
31:34 scientific here guys
31:35 i get up or brush my teeth to take a
31:37 shower i clean my butt
31:38 i do whatever i gotta do get dressed go
31:41 to school go to work whatever i can make
31:43 these decisions i don't need your help
31:44 okay
31:45 then you get into the psychological
31:47 elements of the world
31:48 boyfriend's girlfriends and maybe if
31:50 you're smart you will lean on your
31:51 parents if they are smart enough to help
31:53 you
31:55 so the people that hatch these
31:58 programs for us that are trying to
32:01 redesign the world
32:03 to be utterly as chaotically
32:05 dysfunctional as they are
32:07 and remember a drunk always wants you to
32:08 be a drunk therefore they're not a drunk
32:10 we're all just drinkers
32:12 right so a crazy person wants you to be
32:14 crazy
32:16 or confused person wants you to be
32:17 confused
32:19 so they're normal
32:22 if there's a such uh definition of you
32:25 know normality at all
32:29 so they know that you they can get your
32:30 kid at the right passage
32:34 your kid is genetically trying to
32:37 start anew why do you think music has
32:41 always been
32:42 thrown away and reinvented part of it
32:44 does
32:45 come from the the industry itself
32:48 is has made it mechanical at this point
32:51 but it before a
32:52 music company said no we don't want to
32:54 listen glenn miller anymore we want to
32:56 listen to little richard
32:57 no not little richard the beatles you
32:59 know on and on and on
33:00 it happened organically first and the
33:03 record companies
33:04 companies simply recognized it and
33:06 industrialized it
33:09 so when you find something is malleable
33:13 it's like clay you can change it
33:17 you know there's that saying they say
33:18 don't let a crisis go to waste
33:22 well don't let any opportunity go to
33:24 waste it's probably an easier way to say
33:25 it because it doesn't take a crisis for
33:27 these people to be interested
33:29 in doing what they do especially if they
33:31 can
33:32 mold society a lot of you know about the
33:35 mkultra program
33:38 which this person i talked to mentioned
33:41 as if it
33:42 might be true what a [ __ ]
33:45 it's the one secret program the united
33:48 states of america
33:50 that actually paid damages to the people
33:53 that were in it
33:54 it's not secret to an idiot it's secret
33:58 agenda 21 ain't secret
34:02 so when the government figured out that
34:06 these german scientists
34:08 who were nazis had figured out
34:11 methods of controlling the human mind
34:13 regardless of whether or not it's
34:14 complete or
34:15 partial they got very excited
34:20 let me ask you this question and for
34:23 those of you who haven't heard this kind
34:25 of news before i apologize for being the
34:27 first one to tell you but i
34:29 i would find it shocking if you haven't
34:31 heard this kind of news
34:33 we have children under 10
34:36 getting sexual reassignment surgery
34:40 and just happen to have massively
34:41 liberal parents
34:43 in some cases it's a split decision the
34:45 father's like
34:46 what i paid extra money
34:49 honey so you could stay home not so you
34:52 could watch tv
34:54 find some trend to make you feel
34:56 important to then munch house and by
34:58 proxy
34:59 our sons genitals off of his body he got
35:02 him fully convinced
35:03 that's what he wants to do when he has
35:06 no clue
35:07 what he wants to do
35:10 but that stuff's happening how do you
35:12 think it happens
35:15 now again people are
35:18 gay it happens right again my family
35:22 alone
35:23 and we had uh back in the 40s and 50s we
35:26 had a
35:28 married in woman who um
35:31 had two sons wanted a daughter begged
35:34 her husband for the third child
35:36 had another son and couldn't handle it
35:39 so she dressed her son like a little
35:40 girl until he was 12.
35:43 guess what happened he likes guys now
35:47 he's a wonderful human being but i think
35:50 that she
35:51 quite scientifically made that decision
35:53 for him
35:54 but i wouldn't be surprised if he
35:56 wouldn't be utterly offended
35:58 by the fact that that was his life story
36:00 and i've seen a picture of him
36:02 as a little girl on a farm
36:06 in the midwest so
36:09 it can happen as an individual thing and
36:11 it can happen as an outside influence to
36:13 a parent down to a child
36:15 it can also happen directly to the child
36:18 that's why you absolutely have to
36:20 prioritize your child's life once
36:21 they're born
36:22 they're number one you're number two and
36:24 if you can't make that
36:26 sacrifice don't be having any kids
36:29 because that's the rule i mean you can't
36:31 pull it off well
36:32 as an adult if you make them number two
36:35 and you number one
36:36 now yes you have to take care of the
36:38 bills and all that good stuff
36:40 you might construe that as a number one
36:42 but it's not really
36:43 if your kid calls and they're not
36:46 playing you
36:47 they're number one but even if they're
36:48 playing you they got something wrong
36:49 with them and you need to
36:52 straighten that out in a wonderful
36:54 loving way
36:56 i really feel for people today
37:00 who are struggling to figure out who
37:02 they are
37:04 because when i was a kid it was pretty
37:06 basic i mean seriously i don't even know
37:08 what binary decisions we had to make as
37:10 a kid
37:11 you know it might be uh do you like this
37:14 music
37:15 i remember one time in high school
37:18 um i was a prince fan you know like in
37:21 1981
37:23 and nobody knew who the guy was he was
37:25 definitely weird
37:26 uh you know visually at least right
37:28 amazing
37:29 musician of course right but i remember
37:32 standing in line at school and this was
37:35 a peer pressure moment that i sort of
37:36 felt uncomfortable with
37:39 and i there's there was a guy who was
37:41 older than me
37:43 he was standing in line and he i think
37:45 had said something
37:46 like he didn't like prince a couple
37:49 years
37:50 ago right and so purple rain was up
37:53 there we had 1999 the dude is all over
37:55 the charts so you know he's made a bunch
37:57 of great music
37:58 and i can't remember if i asked him or
38:00 someone else to ask them i can't
38:01 remember
38:02 but i remember him getting asked if he
38:04 liked prince after two years now maybe
38:06 he did
38:06 maybe he didn't the look on his face was
38:10 like
38:11 he had no choice but to say yes it's a
38:13 petty thing
38:15 but that's about as severe as it was
38:17 when i was a kid
38:18 the only other thing was someone
38:20 offering you a cigarette that's why i
38:22 started my first
38:23 cigarette at nine years old dude simple
38:26 can you smoke cigarettes and i was like
38:27 sure
38:29 and he gave me one well can you inhale
38:31 i'm like sure
38:32 i'm just making this up now i think i
38:34 was watching no no my parents hadn't
38:36 smoked at all my grandparents had smoked
38:38 that's how i got started and i got super
38:41 addicted for about a year and a half
38:45 but then there was a point i was
38:46 actually running and playing
38:48 hide-and-go-seek
38:49 like ten probably ten a pack of
38:52 cigarettes in my
38:53 pocket and i went around a corner and
38:55 hid behind some bush thing in my
38:57 apartment complex and remember i was out
38:58 of
38:59 i was out of air i was winded and i was
39:02 like
39:03 they always said that cigarettes would
39:04 make you winded
39:06 and i took that pack of cigarettes out
39:08 which was like bars of gold man it was a
39:10 winston pack with filters man i just
39:11 switched over to filters after a year of
39:14 non-filters i put on the ground and i
39:16 stomped it
39:18 and i never well i smoked a couple more
39:20 times to prove i didn't like smoking but
39:21 i didn't
39:22 um i didn't heal
39:25 any more cigarettes man
39:28 but just think about it today man
39:31 think about it today so let's break it
39:33 down a little bit
39:35 the kid thing we just talked about
39:39 it's um
39:42 you know it's parents trying to create a
39:45 um and i don't know what it is i mean
39:49 there's this thing of trying to be in
39:50 the in
39:51 crowd or trying to be the rebellious one
39:55 in my hometown we have a few people
39:59 online who are just
40:02 just all i can say is abject morons they
40:05 when you question them about anything
40:06 that they
40:07 supposedly post on their facebook page
40:10 as to having any knowledge about what
40:11 they're talking about they've got zero
40:13 and so they do what democrats do which
40:15 is to call your name
40:17 that's their game you know alex jones
40:20 had shakes thrown on him and you know
40:21 that was the new thing so now if you
40:23 they say oh
40:24 trump's a racist you know okay well
40:25 let's let's have a look
40:27 i'll call him a racist if he's one
40:28 that's let's have it
40:31 spit on you
40:36 i mean is this an intelligent slice of
40:38 humanity that we're
40:39 enabling or perhaps the contrary
40:43 i mean since we are in a fight for the
40:46 entire planet's
40:47 sovereignty at this point i thought
40:49 maybe talking about it might help
40:52 but we have this new silent majority
40:55 it shouldn't be silent why is it silent
40:59 well it's silent for a very good reason
41:02 crazy just
41:03 grabbed a few you know molotov cocktails
41:07 and they got george soros to fund them
41:09 they joined a fascist group
41:12 to kill fascism absolutely hysterical
41:15 man
41:17 they removed all doubt by opening their
41:20 mouths that they're complete idiots
41:22 i mean can't prove their own points i
41:24 mean it's not name calling back the
41:26 other way when you're sitting there
41:27 going sit down with me and debate this
41:29 man
41:31 spit shake name calling and you're just
41:34 like
41:35 the interesting irony about it is the
41:37 the conspiracy people been dealing with
41:39 this for
41:40 forever a second you say
41:44 lee harvey oswald and kennedy what are
41:46 you kidding me did you see the shot did
41:49 you see the evidence
41:50 like this is nuts and then it's like how
41:54 dare you
41:56 it's done in religion too if you do your
41:59 research
42:00 you're to come up with a completely
42:02 different belief system about everything
42:03 you might keep the message but in the
42:05 end you'll go
42:06 don't don't lecture me about proof dude
42:09 and then you pull out your tome of
42:11 fiction
42:11 to make me believe that this is true
42:14 that ain't a conversation
42:16 that's like me saying you don't think
42:18 spider-man's real well here's all the
42:19 spider-man comic books
42:21 see spider-man comic books say
42:22 spider-man is real
42:25 that's not a conversation it's
42:28 intelligent
42:30 that's like passive bulliness right
42:35 but let's get out of the kid phase let's
42:37 go up to the adults of today
42:39 which is where this whole thing is
42:42 occurring
42:44 well it's gotten to the point now where
42:46 there is now hundreds of articles online
42:49 globally that if you support
42:52 certain unpopular people
42:56 or things or actions or belief systems
43:00 that are not violating common law
43:03 okay you could be a crazy person saying
43:06 that you know
43:07 uh what is it the news age fluidity is
43:10 the new democrat platform where they're
43:12 trying to literally say
43:14 that a grown man can identify as a
43:16 little girl and he can molest a boy
43:19 it's called age fluidity unbelievable
43:23 he's age fluid
43:26 take your pick what party you want to be
43:28 on man because
43:29 i don't know how many liberals will go
43:31 for that one who are just normal
43:33 liberal people right
43:36 but today employers will fire you for
43:40 your social media post
43:42 in america we've had i don't know i
43:44 don't even know how many
43:45 dozens and dozens and dozens of people
43:47 fired for saying they like the president
43:50 of the united states
43:52 because they just keep a little list of
43:54 everything that he's done since he's
43:55 been in office
43:57 my new friends that are awake are doing
44:00 that they're keeping a list of
44:01 everything that he's done
44:03 that actually impacts their life makes
44:05 things better
44:06 improves the country they're black and
44:09 white
44:10 on a piece of paper benefiting all
44:12 people
44:13 all genders all races
44:16 now what's really interesting between
44:18 politics and religion in america at
44:20 least i can't speak for your country
44:22 if you don't live here is that
44:25 it used to be like that for religion
44:27 right remember the inquisitions of
44:29 europe
44:30 if you didn't say you loved jesus
44:34 the pope hired mercenaries
44:38 to go kill you to torture you and kill
44:40 you
44:42 if you turn over your soul to jesus
44:46 this went on for nearly a thousand years
44:50 formally and then informally who knows
44:53 probably another
44:54 five or six hundred years but now it's
44:57 interesting is
44:58 think about it today let's say you went
45:00 to
45:01 one of these restaurants that has to
45:02 pull their whole crew outside
45:05 which is the worst configuration for a
45:08 virus right
45:10 if i coughed inside and i you know cover
45:12 my mouth yeah there's going to be a
45:13 cloud around me a little bit
45:15 but if i cough and there's a gust of
45:16 wind it can go 30 feet into someone's
45:19 face
45:20 it's just great but let's just say
45:22 you're in public
45:25 you sit down with some of your friends
45:26 and you say you know guys i i don't mean
45:28 to offend you whatsoever but
45:31 don't believe in any religions i just
45:34 don't
45:34 i've done my research 20 years
45:38 i became an anthropologist and an
45:40 archaeologist and a historian
45:42 and so i'm very well versed in all
45:44 things i've read 200 books
45:46 i just don't think that any of that
45:48 stuff is actually real now i love the
45:49 message but i don't think it's real
45:52 and most the people today in america i
45:55 don't care if you went to the bible belt
45:59 in the south they're not going to kill
46:02 you across the table
46:04 you won't get fired as long as you can
46:06 articulate the fact that you still care
46:08 about humanity
46:10 but you're not you're not pro you know
46:12 anti-common law stuff right
46:17 but today
46:20 if you sit at tables depending on where
46:23 you are in the world
46:24 and you go i love donald trump i think
46:27 he's great
46:29 there's some tables that will just spit
46:31 in your face and you could have a movie
46:33 producer in front of you
46:34 someone a script writer you could have
46:36 someone amazing in front of you
46:38 who has a high iq where they need it
46:41 right
46:42 socially maybe it's zero intellectually
46:47 there's different categories of the
46:48 little pie and uh
46:50 trivial pursuits and their social ones
46:54 really down their psychopaths or
46:55 sociopaths right in there
46:57 but they're amazing at what they do
46:59 right but right now we're at a utter
47:01 high
47:02 of political inability to discuss
47:05 differences
47:06 and why is that i mean politics has been
47:09 around for a long time
47:10 religion's been around for a long time
47:13 well it's a little complex but the basic
47:16 reason is
47:16 is that politics is recently getting
47:20 manipulated at a level that is so
47:22 blatant
47:25 that once we took a position of
47:28 putting our country first in this
47:30 country of america
47:32 we found all the cockroaches at the top
47:34 that were actually serving other people
47:38 and then we found the loyalists
47:41 through peer pressure or ignorance that
47:44 supported them
47:45 and they're coming out against us at the
47:47 bottom level
47:50 all we're saying is we want the country
47:51 to be better because
47:54 left or right presidents haven't done
47:55 much in a really really long time
47:58 like to a point where almost no one
47:59 remembers the last time
48:01 anything was passed by their government
48:03 that helped them out
48:04 i mean the 60s got the civil rights and
48:06 desegregation that kind of stuff
48:08 thumbs up man we got seat belts okay
48:11 that's pretty good
48:13 and it goes dry but religion has been a
48:17 war that's been fought for
48:19 thousands of years and so all that
48:22 blood that was spilled in europe
48:26 and it was mainly satiated over there
48:29 and when you came over here we still had
48:31 salem's
48:32 witch hunt and we had um
48:36 joseph campbell was murdered for his
48:37 beliefs whatever
48:40 so we have had you know religious
48:41 prosecution since
48:43 the uh inquisition days
48:47 but it's it's a fraction of what it used
48:50 to be and especially on the personal
48:51 level
48:52 we typically just know that those
48:55 conversations are acidic
48:57 but it the reason why i'm mentioning
48:59 that i'm not trying to make this a
49:00 political episode
49:02 but that's a really intense thing that's
49:04 going on right now to give you a perfect
49:06 example
49:07 of the people and we're all guilty of it
49:11 where we're in a public situation
49:14 and someone's saying something
49:17 and uh we don't retort
49:21 like my writing mentor very liberal guy
49:25 believes in a lot of things i don't
49:26 believe although i think the next time
49:28 i'm going to eat with him
49:29 it's going to be a different game but
49:31 here's what happens in that conversation
49:34 he will bash our president like crazy
49:37 say outrageous ridiculous things that
49:39 aren't true
49:40 i mean to the point where he said that
49:42 donald trump is incapable of reading
49:46 it's like he got a degree dude he was
49:48 really good and you know
49:50 uh but he was he literally said it like
49:52 it was real
49:55 now we've seen him read miles of
49:56 teleprompters and speeches and it's like
49:58 give me a break man
50:01 but what i don't do partly because i
50:05 don't want to sink to that level is i
50:06 don't
50:07 throw positives back i mean i do but i
50:11 really kind of do like a twilight zone i
50:13 sneak it into
50:14 another story because i don't think i'm
50:17 dealing with
50:18 a completely developed person in that
50:21 realm of thinking
50:24 because there's anger right
50:27 one of the most brilliant things i ever
50:29 heard
50:30 and i can't remember what context it was
50:32 in was that anger is a sign of
50:34 a lack of intelligence
50:38 we're all guilty of it i mean god just
50:41 measure how much you're angry throughout
50:43 the day
50:46 for no apparent reason let's just put
50:48 that way to find not to be unable to
50:50 find a solution because most men
50:53 are known men men not these bettas that
50:56 are out there
50:57 most men want to solve problems because
51:00 we don't have time for your whiny money
51:02 crap
51:02 thank you for mentioning it to me and
51:04 let's wipe the tears off
51:06 now the only thing that's going to
51:07 replace those tears with glistening eyes
51:10 of
51:11 happiness is for you to watch me
51:14 destroy what is causing those tears
51:18 so just watch this a guy pulls out all
51:20 of his wisdom and all of his knowledge
51:22 and he conquers that thing
51:24 and gets it out of there we know that
51:27 the
51:28 venetians they love to to
51:31 wallow in that emotion because that for
51:34 them
51:35 is a dopamine dropping loop that is
51:38 entertaining and
51:39 almost sexually arousing to complain and
51:42 cry
51:43 for some people and the most attractive
51:46 venetians are the ones that don't do
51:47 that
51:48 they're badasses that solve problems
51:50 just as good as the martians
51:53 now let's go back to the major theme of
51:56 this
51:57 now that we've given some examples that
52:00 are very current
52:04 you will hear people tell you things
52:06 sometimes like advice
52:09 that seems inconceivable or you'll hear
52:12 sometimes advice that you know
52:14 is true for some reason you gotta block
52:18 now i'm going to give you an example
52:21 related to this
52:22 show and then i'm going to give an
52:24 example that's going to hopefully make
52:26 the first one seem a lot easier if
52:29 you've suffered from anxiety
52:31 of what other people think about you
52:33 then that's an insecurity right
52:37 that means you're not your best so if i
52:40 said to you
52:41 you know what i have rarely if ever
52:45 cared what anyone thinks about me i mean
52:47 maybe the girl i'm trying to date right
52:49 but even that if i gotta work really
52:51 really hard to make a girl like me she's
52:54 the wrong
52:55 woman she's the wrong person and nothing
52:58 wrong with her
52:59 she has her preferences i miscalculated
53:02 i didn't ask the right questions at the
53:04 beginning or maybe this is the first
53:05 date and i'm figuring it out
53:07 and there you go we can be friends
53:10 but we can't take it to that next level
53:14 and a lot of people are bizarrely
53:16 annoying human beings
53:18 that don't understand that they are
53:20 repulsive
53:22 they're human repellent it's just all
53:24 built into their system
53:26 but they're they don't care what you
53:27 think and so they hang on to that
53:29 hey two thumbs up for them but they're
53:32 gonna die alone
53:34 unless they can find someone who is
53:36 absolutely born to be perfectly
53:37 compatible with them
53:39 that almost never happens right we have
53:42 areas of our life that we
53:44 will change because we don't care we
53:47 want to see it up or seat down either
53:48 way i can do this right
53:50 tube on tube off whatev whatever you you
53:52 know those things i don't care about
53:54 it's definitely not worth losing a great
53:56 rewarding relationship for
53:58 and so you change those things you want
54:00 to make the bet every day i don't mind
54:02 if that's what it's going to do to keep
54:03 our relationship together that's nothing
54:05 what we got here is priceless right
54:09 but out of those realms if i told you
54:11 who cares what
54:12 anyone thinks about you in social media
54:15 well you know save your employer um
54:20 trying to fire you through sheer
54:22 discrimination which is illegal
54:24 as hell proving it's the other problem
54:28 but some people have so much anxiety
54:30 they look at that statement yeah well
54:31 that's easy for you
54:33 you're confident and you don't have
54:34 these problems you don't have a whole
54:35 history
54:37 of this worried about what other people
54:39 think
54:41 okay but now let's talk about
54:44 getting in shape let's say you're
54:48 overweight
54:48 let's say you're not overweight let's
54:50 just say you just
54:51 you need to firm up a little bit
54:55 but let's say you were a little a few
54:56 pounds overweight and you're
54:58 10 to 15 pounds overweight and you
55:00 haven't worked out ever in your whole
55:01 life or you used to but that's 20 years
55:03 ago
55:04 and i said well you know how to fix that
55:06 right it's
55:08 easy stop eating crappy food eat healthy
55:11 food
55:12 get a good night's rest don't stress
55:14 yourself out and those are the weights
55:15 over there
55:17 have you ever seen a push-up you ever
55:19 seen a
55:20 setup have you ever done the jumping
55:23 jacks
55:24 have you ever jumped a rope all these
55:27 basic things you know will fix
55:29 your health issue your your appearance
55:32 which will make you love yourself even
55:33 more every time you see a reflective
55:35 surface
55:35 some you have the privilege of doing
55:40 now let's compare the two
55:43 because it's very important for your
55:44 mind
55:47 one is the decision you make and you're
55:49 done
55:51 you know what i'm tired of caring what
55:52 other people think i'm just gonna be
55:54 myself
55:55 because i have to live in my body
55:58 24 hours a day 365 days out of the year
56:02 and if you're worried about what other
56:03 people think about you
56:05 the likelihood is when you're home alone
56:08 in your car alone in the shower alone
56:10 you're still
56:11 worried what the outcome is going to be
56:14 for that day
56:15 for a five-minute moment with somebody
56:17 else
56:18 again don't try too freaking hard to
56:20 make people love you i mean if you know
56:22 that you stink
56:23 and you know like go take a shower or
56:25 something nice
56:27 yeah those are big those are big course
56:29 adjustments we're not talking about that
56:32 but a lot of things in life are just the
56:34 decision you make in your brain
56:37 instantaneous gratification
56:40 instantaneous upgrade
56:43 okay well let's say i told you all about
56:45 that gym regiment the eating regiment to
56:47 take all those pounds off and make
56:49 yourself look amazing
56:51 well even if you think all that's great
56:53 and you start doing it right away
56:57 you put down the twinkie you pick up the
56:59 carrot while you're eating the carrot
57:01 you're
57:01 doing your weights you know you have
57:03 months and months and months perhaps
57:05 about 90 days minimum to get those rock
57:08 hard abs right
57:12 well that's a huge effort depending on
57:15 your
57:15 body okay
57:18 which one's easier which one's
57:20 phenomenally easier
57:23 the one you make in your brain
57:26 then there's the the true
57:30 reality which is hey man that little
57:33 tiny decision you want me to make in my
57:35 brain
57:35 has been installed since i was a child
57:40 you could have a parent that scolded you
57:41 for not doing what other kids did
57:43 you could have brothers and sisters to
57:45 beat you up for not doing what other
57:46 kids did
57:47 the neighborhood kids could beat you up
57:49 for not doing what they were doing
57:51 and so you have trauma you almost got
57:53 ptsd if not straight up ptsd in your
57:55 system
57:56 which is a lost event inside your psyche
57:58 that haunts you
57:59 but it won't show its face should
58:02 definitely go see my
58:03 ptsd website our website ptsd episode
58:08 if you're definitely suffering from any
58:09 level of ptsd i don't care if you're a
58:11 soldier
58:12 or you were touched when you were a kid
58:16 go see the episode all the mechanics are
58:18 in there
58:20 so if you are still failing feeling the
58:23 anxiety of letting go of that as if
58:26 supposedly your whole world and
58:28 will unravel in a bad way
58:31 what you'll find is this
58:35 and this i told this story probably
58:37 twice
58:39 on the show which is the difference i
58:41 found between san francisco and los
58:43 angeles
58:45 in san francisco it was the most bizarre
58:49 group of human beings
58:50 i have ever seen in one place
58:54 they don't talk to each other they
58:57 barely get along with each other
58:58 because a lot of them are from other
59:00 parts within america
59:01 and other countries but honestly if you
59:04 just took every foreigner out of
59:05 san francisco the problem still exists
59:08 because you have people from all 50
59:09 states trying to rob
59:11 you know silicon valley but it's money
59:15 but they don't feel comfortable ever
59:18 being themselves in that town
59:21 except the more outrageous neighborhoods
59:23 where they're totally themselves
59:25 castro market the center of the gay
59:26 community those dudes are themselves
59:30 seriously they're so themselves it's
59:32 crazy
59:33 but you go out to the quote-unquote
59:35 normal areas and now you've got a bunch
59:38 of just
59:38 tension everywhere from work tension to
59:42 family tension to neighbor
59:44 against neighbor attention for no reason
59:48 the amount of beautiful people i met
59:49 there both internal and
59:51 externally who should have been so
59:54 confident with themselves
59:57 who were behaving as if they were ugly
59:59 who are behaving as if you don't like
60:01 them for some reason even though you had
60:03 nothing against them in fact you really
60:04 like them
60:06 it was off the chart i mean it was like
60:08 taking a geiger counter
60:10 into your local grocery store that has
60:12 never had any
60:13 atomic event occur and all of a sudden
60:15 the needle's peg and you're like what is
60:16 going on in this grocery store
60:18 you know that's what it was like to walk
60:20 into san francisco
60:22 on the meter of people who feel
60:24 comfortable in their own skin
60:26 when it's an absolutely artistically
60:28 beautiful city
60:30 i don't think it was always this way but
60:32 in the 90s and the early 2000s
60:34 my time there i literally got there at
60:37 the beginning of 1991
60:40 and stayed to the uh the end of 2002
60:45 it was insane it was weird and so when i
60:49 came down to california to visit or
60:50 sorry southern california to visit
60:52 that's when and i have to go back home i
60:55 noticed
60:56 this profound difference
61:00 and let me just tell you a little story
61:02 before i give you this example in
61:04 southern california we had a friend of
61:05 ours my girlfriend at the time and i
61:07 one of her friends from the bay area
61:09 came down here to visit
61:11 this is after i moved down and we took
61:13 her to huntington beach
61:15 in the car and
61:17 [Music]
61:19 she was looking out the window at all
61:21 the people
61:22 who were fit tan having a great time
61:26 it's every shape and size if she would
61:28 have paid attention is right there in
61:29 the crowd
61:31 smiles on everyone's faces everyone's
61:33 just like hey man i'm gonna help you out
61:34 man whatever because that's how we roll
61:37 and she said out of the car or in the
61:40 car i should say not the window
61:42 i could never live here
61:46 well it's not the traffic it's not the
61:48 amount of people
61:49 because there's more density up in the
61:51 bay area and there's just as much
61:52 traffic up there as there is down here
61:54 don't let anyone ever tell you that line
61:56 of crap san francisco traffic is
61:59 the worst traffic man it doesn't move
62:02 that's the problem you might have jam
62:04 traffic in l.a but it's moving at least
62:05 right
62:07 so we asked her we said why why would
62:09 you say that that's just weird
62:12 and she goes i just and it was really
62:14 smug and really
62:16 barry-ish which was everybody's pretty
62:19 down here
62:20 and we look at everybody and her whole
62:22 thing was like she was mad at them
62:25 for being who they are and finding
62:27 happiness
62:28 in her mind it mattered by her standards
62:32 of what humans are supposed to look like
62:34 that she felt subpar to them
62:38 absolutely untrue but in her mind she'd
62:42 been programmed by up north
62:45 she felt comfortable i guess if you were
62:47 to reverse the polarity of what she
62:49 said what she was saying was that
62:52 everybody in the berry is
62:53 ugly and unhappy i mean i'm pretty
62:56 cynical but barry but i would say that
62:58 myself
62:59 unhappy yeah it's super stressful to
63:02 live in that area for sure
63:04 ugly no way i've met some of the most
63:07 beautiful
63:08 women in my whole life up there for sure
63:12 but i was at venice beach during one of
63:14 my visits down
63:16 and this counters what my friend
63:19 said in the car and this before venice
63:22 beach got destroyed but
63:23 um i was in some store
63:27 because there's all kinds of cool stores
63:28 in venice right
63:31 i remember this very heavy set girl
63:35 wearing a bikini and she
63:39 had this group of friends around here
63:40 who were all fit
63:42 and they look great in their bikinis but
63:44 she had this she was so
63:46 like probably about five seven but
63:49 really big
63:50 right rolls down her body
63:53 and this bikini is just hanging on for
63:54 dear life right
63:57 but this girl was the center of
63:59 attention within her friends she ran the
64:01 little gang of her friends
64:03 and she had so much confidence
64:07 she it was entertaining i just watched
64:08 she was making me laugh
64:10 and she was just walking you know just
64:13 the last image of her
64:14 in my mind was her walking away from me
64:16 and i couldn't see the straps in her
64:19 clothing because her roles were covering
64:21 them up right she's a young girl
64:24 i remember just thinking you know
64:29 uh pardon the pun but pound for pound
64:31 this girl is more sexy
64:33 than half the girls around here that
64:34 look amazing they're all up tight and
64:36 weird
64:38 because they're just trying to play the
64:39 prissy thing like you can't have
64:40 anything it's like
64:41 whatever let's go in front of me
64:45 way sexier than you and why was that
64:49 because that girl in front of me was the
64:51 most
64:53 person she was being who she wanted to
64:56 be now whether or not she's going to
64:57 stay that way that's her choice
64:59 but for that moment i can tell you man
65:01 she was comfortable in her skin
65:03 and she had a bunch of it most people
65:06 don't like to get um
65:10 suffocated and held down right straight
65:13 up
65:13 literal question most people don't like
65:16 to be physically held down
65:17 and have their oxygen supply removed by
65:20 a hand over their face
65:22 right we're all in agreeance
65:26 right we're all in agreement with some
65:27 of you freaks out there probably yeah i
65:29 don't know
65:30 how long are you gonna do it for but uh
65:33 for those of you who just have an
65:35 instinctual yoga i hate that that's the
65:37 worst right
65:39 okay i want you to think about the
65:42 similarity between
65:44 that someone's holding you down
65:48 face down and then you're covering your
65:50 mouth you can't breathe you can't move
65:52 you're gonna die all because someone is
65:54 holding you down
65:58 is there a more clean definition of a
66:01 horrific death
66:03 but is there also any better
66:07 example for when you need to fight back
66:11 it's your survival man you gotta fight
66:14 back
66:16 all right so you're framing this in your
66:17 head now
66:20 what's the difference between that
66:21 analogy that story
66:25 which you would immediately fight
66:28 and someone telling you who you have to
66:30 be
66:32 someone telling you you can't say what's
66:34 on your mind i mean let's let's
66:36 definitely insert a little pause between
66:37 your brain your mouth
66:39 let's do that little game that americans
66:41 are taught not to do
66:43 but you know as long as you've thought
66:44 things through a little bit
66:46 a lot of times you being who you want to
66:48 be has nothing to do with interfering
66:50 with anyone else's life
66:51 at all you're just your own thing you're
66:54 reliable person
66:56 you're a good person you're not
66:58 incorporating into your fabric a bunch
67:00 of
67:01 schemes and scams and bad things towards
67:04 other people
67:05 you're a good person so what do you got
67:07 to worry about
67:09 the amount of times i've had either my
67:11 girlfriend or
67:13 a friend of mine or somebody worry about
67:16 having to give a little speech
67:19 or having a a real tense communication
67:21 with another loved one or a boss or
67:24 something like that or
67:25 the other one is their employees and
67:28 i'll be talking to him
67:29 you know i'm coaching him through it and
67:31 i'm like okay so what's your concern
67:33 and they'll say well god i want to say
67:34 the wrong thing i don't want to be mean
67:37 now i got friends that need to worry
67:38 about that but they never come to me for
67:40 any help and they don't ever worry about
67:42 it they just go out like
67:44 guns ablazing and you know
67:47 say something very you know
67:51 uncouth during their exchanges
67:54 but the people that are worried i always
67:57 have this
67:58 this thing i say and i always see this
68:01 transformation on their face of like oh
68:03 yeah it's much better and i'm glad i
68:06 found a way to say it on this show
68:07 because i'm thinking 500 plus episodes
68:09 i've never said this which is the
68:11 following
68:13 if you're a good person then you
68:15 probably are
68:17 guess what you don't have the genetic
68:19 fibers
68:20 to do what you're worried about you
68:22 don't have the ability
68:24 to say anything that's uncalculated
68:28 to a group of people or an individual
68:30 you can't offend somebody slash make
68:32 them angry
68:34 because you don't have it in your fiber
68:36 and if you're worried about
68:38 it you're gonna do what i do which is
68:40 you tell the person
68:42 initially about the elephant that's in
68:45 the room in your brain you go hey look
68:48 gotta tell you something but you know i
68:50 love you man and i mean this just from
68:52 the bottom of my heart
68:54 got to figure this thing out you know
68:56 that thing you do
68:58 you know when i said that the other day
68:59 and then you did this
69:02 i'm trying to understand it because i
69:03 don't get it but
69:05 i i need to either understand it and
69:08 then we can move forward you can
69:10 continue doing it or i need to
69:11 understand it
69:13 and i need you to understand it so maybe
69:15 we don't do that as much
69:16 if at all and then poof you're having a
69:20 great conversation with somebody
69:24 now there's a third species of this
69:27 entire thing
69:29 first two being youthful peer pressure
69:32 and then the more acidic adult peer
69:35 pressure
69:36 because it just gets more
69:37 multi-dimensional as you get older right
69:40 when you're a kid it's just the [ __ ]
69:41 in the neighborhood when you get older
69:43 as an adult it's your employer it's your
69:44 wife it's your husband it's your kids
69:46 it's the public it's that
69:48 right i'm willing to bet
69:51 at least half of you have seen this
69:54 online in the last
69:55 four months especially in 2020
69:59 and someone makes a fairly large post
70:02 and paragraph form
70:04 on their social media usually facebook
70:07 because twitter doesn't allow you to
70:08 express yourself
70:11 but they'll start off by saying hey
70:13 folks
70:15 i have worried about what people thought
70:16 about me for a really really long time
70:20 but i'm tired of worrying about what
70:23 other people think about me
70:25 so from this point forward i'm drawing a
70:27 line in the sand and i'm going to be who
70:28 i am
70:30 and if that rubs you wrong i'm really
70:32 sorry i'm not trying to rub you wrong
70:35 but i can't do this anymore i can't live
70:37 and alive who i am as a person
70:40 like i said in a few episodes back buddy
70:42 of mine from high school
70:44 is getting all the sexual reassignment
70:46 search surgeries i think he might even
70:48 be done
70:49 and he is now a she and when i asked him
70:52 i said look dude we've known each other
70:54 forever
70:56 like when did you know this was the case
70:58 and he's like
70:59 always man he goes i got married and had
71:00 two daughters
71:02 and i knew the whole time i was
71:04 something else
71:06 okay i can trust that guy's instinct
71:07 right
71:09 but my point is that we make decisions
71:13 sometimes and we need to let other
71:14 people know that we've made the decision
71:17 he knew he was going to show up at
71:19 events as a woman
71:22 and he doesn't want people to treat him
71:24 wrong now what he needs to know
71:26 in fact he skipped our last reunion and
71:28 i think it was because of these
71:29 decisions
71:30 and i pushed into his mind look dude
71:35 you're not the only person who's uh
71:37 different like this
71:39 and those other people show up but we
71:41 treat them like gold
71:43 now sadly we do have one member of my
71:45 class that uh
71:46 a gentleman who is gay and he never
71:49 shows up because he's worried
71:50 it's like dude it's it's 20 20 man
71:54 it ain't 1987 anymore
71:57 but you may need to put that line in the
72:00 sand
72:00 go to your closest folks let people know
72:04 if you're going to make a very distinct
72:06 change
72:07 doesn't always have to be a sex change
72:08 but uh
72:11 if you're like look man i i dig our
72:13 president or i don't like our president
72:15 whatever
72:16 it's it's so in vogue to hate today
72:18 isn't it
72:20 that's what's in vogue do
72:23 harm as invoke
72:27 what frightens me in a way
72:32 is the uh the old phrase mob rules
72:37 now have you ever heard of mob rules
72:41 attached to a group of people going
72:43 around singing
72:45 christmas carols handing out food to
72:48 homeless people
72:51 just being kind to other people big mob
72:54 of people mows everybody's yards one day
72:56 a bunch of
72:57 mob people clean everybody's cars has
73:00 mob rules
73:01 ever been attached to something good
73:04 ever in my life it's never been done
73:10 by the way if you haven't heard dio's
73:12 black sabbath
73:13 song mob rules it's a it's an awesome
73:16 song
73:17 will teach us all a few things
73:22 my rules is always attached to pure
73:24 concentrated evil
73:26 and ignorance all mixed up in a gray
73:29 soup
73:31 and it's always responsible
73:34 before the physical and psychological
73:37 destruction
73:38 that can only be compared to a cat
73:41 5 hurricane an f5 tornado
73:46 that's just laying waste to the land of
73:48 which it it just traversed
73:51 the genghis khan just
73:54 wipe of all things maybe alexander the
73:57 great
73:58 just destroying things
74:02 and what's funny is we know that if we
74:04 were to ever have a time machine like
74:06 bill and ted's excellent adventure
74:07 was the part 3 coming out here soon
74:10 let's hope that's good
74:12 if we could go back and interview a
74:14 genghis khan warrior we could speak the
74:16 fluent language
74:17 we would hear a million reasons why
74:19 their raping and pillaging across
74:21 eurasia and parts of europe
74:24 was the greatest thing ever right while
74:28 they're doing it
74:30 again like i said in the previous
74:32 episode iago is not a bad guy to iago
74:36 just to us who watching his destruction
74:38 from the outside
74:42 we have cities around the world
74:46 with misled people using
74:49 false excuses to do what they do
74:52 we have foreign infiltrators paid for by
74:54 george soros coming over here who are
74:56 getting ceremoniously executed every
74:58 time they're caught
75:01 the interesting thing is is that
75:04 when i was young and life was good
75:08 there were you know it wasn't like it
75:11 was the first time we'd ever heard of
75:13 stories of
75:13 the rooskies coming over and taking over
75:15 america and paratrooping in your
75:17 backyard what do you think the
75:19 patrick swayze movie uh red dom was all
75:21 about
75:22 it was engaging that little fear complex
75:24 and putting together a scenario that
75:26 although kind of
75:27 kind of silly still kind of clicked in
75:29 your brain oh yeah i guess that could
75:30 happen yeah that's really weird you know
75:33 and today it's happening
75:37 all around the world and what's
75:40 interesting is we have these
75:42 these polarizing moments and i'm saying
75:45 these things
75:46 because there's a bunch of decisions
75:47 that have to be made in each one of us
75:49 to figure out what the hell we stand for
75:51 at this point
75:55 we're passing useless laws on top of
75:57 other laws at this point just to make a
75:59 bunch of people feel
75:59 comfortable it's really strange i don't
76:02 want to get into exactly which ones but
76:04 a lot of you know what i'm talking about
76:06 groups that are protected by laws are
76:08 passing groups to specifically protect
76:10 those groups with the same exact laws
76:12 and then you see it all over the
76:13 internet like it's an accomplishment
76:15 you're like
76:16 really okay whatever
76:19 you know it's like the old dennis miller
76:21 joke the ad in the back of the national
76:23 choir that says avoid mail fraud send
76:26 five dollars
76:30 and then he goes honey i think i'll send
76:32 10 will be doubly protected
76:36 but if you understand sovereignty and
76:38 tyranny the two opposing factors
76:42 then you'll understand why france was
76:44 doing what they were doing in paris and
76:46 you understand why brexit was doing what
76:48 it was doing and now the latest version
76:50 is hong kong
76:52 all right it's gonna get messy over
76:56 there people
76:56 it's gonna get real messy
77:00 you deserve to be who you are
77:05 if there's no other thing that you'll
77:07 ever hear or ever accept out of my voice
77:10 that is something hopefully that sinks
77:13 in
77:13 you deserve to be who you are whatever
77:16 that is man
77:19 now sadly sadly that statement is
77:23 probably better made in 1977
77:26 and not in 2020
77:29 we do have individuals who are um
77:33 mentally ill who
77:34 [Music]
77:36 like to hurt kids and those kind of
77:38 people i'm probably not talking to those
77:40 kind of people
77:41 talking about very simple normal people
77:43 like us
77:46 again if i said
77:49 are you a good person and you had to
77:52 make a decision
77:53 how do you even give me a real answer
77:57 well yeah i'm a good person but if you
77:59 really thought about it okay well i am
78:01 like a person hey
78:02 you know you don't know well that's the
78:05 beauty
78:05 behind common law that's the beauty
78:11 you just say okay today not yesterday
78:16 but today am i a person who from this
78:18 point forward is gonna
78:19 am i gonna hurt anyone else to get ahead
78:22 is that the kind of person i am
78:24 have i ever been that kind of person
78:26 have i ever done it
78:27 one time you can just do a real simple
78:30 calculation
78:31 see it from their perspective now it
78:33 doesn't mean that if you broke up with
78:34 the person because they're not good for
78:36 you that you're a mean person
78:37 you did them both yourself and them a
78:39 favor
78:42 that maybe you cheated on somebody
78:45 physically
78:45 mentally whatever but as long as you're
78:48 committed not to get in that situation
78:49 again you haven't done it for a while
78:51 and you could probably say well you know
78:52 i had my bumps humanity
78:54 is a hell of a thing to experience
78:57 but right now yeah i'm really in a good
79:00 place
79:03 we are capable of being good people
79:08 to the degree we create a great country
79:11 to live in
79:14 sadly folks
79:17 misunderstand a lot of that
79:20 uh the gentleman i sat down with who has
79:22 a
79:23 lifelong career and trying to make
79:26 himself feel comfortable in his own skin
79:29 was right out of the gate you know i
79:31 don't think you should be able to have a
79:32 gun
79:34 okay it's like hitting my first rodeo on
79:37 that conversation
79:38 the dude has got the privilege to say
79:40 that phrase to me
79:43 because he lives in a country where guns
79:45 gave him that permission
79:47 a capability of saying that
79:52 obviously his history
79:56 of gun grabbing is at zero absolute zero
79:59 or he's
80:00 in some form of denial but we're at a
80:03 point now where
80:04 forces in this world
80:08 are trying to make some very bad
80:11 changes and
80:14 this is going to sound sort of um
80:19 all-american america arrogant
80:23 but let's look at the world right now
80:25 2020.
80:27 the european union has done nothing more
80:30 than bankrupt the entire european
80:32 community which is why
80:33 the queen wanted out she won the pound
80:35 sterling to be
80:36 secured canada has the queen's money
80:41 australia kings queen's money think new
80:44 zealand as well
80:45 hong kong had it now putin he's living
80:48 in gangster land he is literally
80:51 you know sort of a mix between rodeo
80:53 drive and dodge city
80:56 well china's all communistic and you've
81:00 got some
81:01 countries in the eurasian areas of
81:02 course the middle east it's a mix-up
81:04 between
81:05 sharia law and normality
81:09 there's some normality that's getting
81:10 popular over there women are starting to
81:12 drive it's good
81:14 but i guarantee you if somebody says
81:16 they want to practice sharia law in
81:17 saudi arabia
81:19 they can't and probably do that means a
81:22 lot of rights are
81:23 different between our two worlds africa
81:26 is getting raped
81:28 south america is getting raped so the
81:31 only country
81:32 and you can correct me if you like i
81:36 i respect you the only country
81:40 that's got an army okay because there
81:42 are little factions in europe that still
81:44 hold out
81:48 is america we're hanging on to magna
81:51 carta we're hanging on to
81:52 a common law base of a country
81:57 no we're not perfect man
82:01 but they're trying to do the massive
82:03 squeeze right now
82:05 and what i'm trying to get
82:09 sort of a beat on because there's
82:12 those of you in all the countries i
82:14 mentioned who are fighting back
82:16 trying to get rid of the european union
82:19 you know
82:20 what i don't understand about australia
82:22 and i've heard an interesting conspiracy
82:24 about australia too
82:26 was that it's supposed to be a penal
82:27 colony out of europe
82:29 out of england right all the prisoners
82:31 are taking way way far away
82:33 and apparently some of the historians
82:35 are now finding out that that wasn't
82:37 even true
82:38 that they were actually murdering these
82:40 people in the middle of the ocean they
82:42 were like we don't need to take them to
82:43 an island completely on the other side
82:44 of the world we'll just push them off in
82:46 the ocean
82:47 who's going to know they're not going to
82:49 go to australia to check it
82:50 and when they finally started migrating
82:52 there you have
82:54 non-penal colony families moving there
82:56 i'm sure you have some
82:58 as well but they looking at the
83:00 displacement of the aborigines and when
83:02 this actually occurred
83:06 and the dates don't match up but so for
83:09 another episode
83:11 but okay let's say you believe that
83:12 history why on earth would you have your
83:15 captors face
83:16 on your money i guarantee if america
83:19 considered itself a penal colony of
83:21 europe there's no european
83:23 czar king queen that's going to be on
83:25 our money we just told you to go f
83:27 yourself
83:28 we took this place from you and that's
83:30 your punishment
83:31 for creating the tyranny you had in
83:34 europe
83:38 what's really interesting is is that and
83:40 i get this from
83:41 people in europe okay so i can't really
83:44 personally have an opinion it's terribly
83:47 rooted
83:48 that some of my friends from europe are
83:49 like okay
83:52 europe is always trying to lecture
83:53 america about
83:55 how to handle guns and freedom of speech
83:57 and all this other stuff
83:59 when europe
84:02 de facto has the longest recorded
84:05 history of
84:06 tyranny and suffering and monarchy
84:09 in the world the most
84:13 suffering as a result of bad leadership
84:16 and complicit citizens is in europe
84:19 and the eu is holding their head up like
84:22 they're
84:23 not going to be doing it again when they
84:25 have agenda 21
84:26 that first removes about 95 to 99
84:29 percent of the population of the planet
84:31 and enslaves the rest
84:35 why am i bringing that up in this
84:36 episode it's not off topic
84:41 you have to be yourself you have to
84:44 stand up for the rights
84:46 that you want to live by if you have a
84:49 king and queen in your country do you
84:50 really want them
84:51 in your country i mean not like you have
84:53 to get rid of them physically but just
84:55 do you want that to be involved with
84:56 your government
84:58 does your government really represent
85:00 you
85:01 big question i know that the peer
85:04 pressure
85:06 in europe is massive to go along with
85:09 what's going on
85:12 there's a whole history of it you don't
85:15 get a hitler
85:16 without complain uh complicity in this
85:18 in the people you don't get a
85:20 mussolini without the citizens just
85:23 laying down every single time these
85:25 crazies it's one dude
85:27 with the few guys that are helping him
85:29 out
85:30 and these people get to exist for
85:33 decades and destroy the world
85:37 it blows my mind that any king and queen
85:39 have ever arisen in human history
85:43 but how did they do it they create
85:46 lore like king arthur to try and
85:48 convince you
85:49 that luther pin dragon put that person
85:54 in the castle if you go against that
85:56 person
85:57 then dragon will come out of the ground
85:59 and destroy your family
86:03 how many of you remember the movie mars
86:05 attack i just mentioned it the other day
86:09 jack black was in the movie and it was a
86:13 little family living in an rv i think he
86:16 had a little brother too
86:18 he was looking up to him and they played
86:21 him like a [ __ ]
86:22 the whole family was a bunch of inbreds
86:25 and it was that
86:26 he wanted to go off and join the
86:28 military and be a big
86:29 you know u.s soldier kid in the 50s
86:32 right
86:33 and they played it like that because
86:36 what they were trying to show i guess
86:38 tim burton or whatever
86:39 was trying to say this kind of soldier
86:42 is very very dangerous
86:44 because that soldier is the one that put
86:45 the king
86:47 in power and keeps him in power
86:50 mexico federal rallies same thing 39
86:53 families this is what i've been told
86:55 several times 39 families run mexico
86:57 plus or minus one or two
87:00 okay wow those people are easy to find
87:04 they're an ample supply and if they get
87:07 killed you find another one put them
87:08 right in that same position boom
87:10 still in power do you want to be
87:14 those kind of people why do we stress
87:17 education on this show
87:18 so much you know again my friend who's a
87:22 psychologist told me
87:23 i've said this a couple times on the
87:24 show but it's important to remember
87:27 that they put a cap on the intelligence
87:30 quotient the iq of a cop in the united
87:34 states
87:35 to make sure it is as low as possible
87:38 so they can get them to do anything that
87:40 they're told to do
87:41 they don't have the enlightenment to
87:43 look at this and go i'm not going to do
87:45 that that's against the constitution
87:47 that person deserves you know some help
87:50 now obviously what happens over time is
87:52 they bring him in through the academy
87:54 let's just say maybe maybe this is
87:57 he showed me the report so you show me
87:59 because he used to work in law
88:00 enforcement
88:02 because he showed me like i wouldn't
88:03 believe him i actually believed him but
88:04 he did show me the
88:06 the statistic on a piece of paper on a
88:08 website
88:11 they get smarter over time just because
88:13 that's what happens in life
88:14 and eventually you hit that wise soul
88:17 that's like okay let's drive this guy
88:19 home
88:20 instead of killing him in a wendy's
88:22 parking lot just because he's drunk
88:25 i'm sitting in his car asleep what a
88:28 great idea
88:29 right a little bit of humanity right
88:33 what's happening in 2020 is that
88:36 everyone's finding something to stand up
88:38 for
88:39 and that's a very empowering thing
88:42 obviously a lot of people are waking up
88:45 in your
88:46 17 movement thing they've learned about
88:49 all these
88:50 crazies that are hurting people hurting
88:53 children
88:54 primarily
88:57 but then you have your folks that just
88:59 woke up yesterday
89:00 kinda like they've been utterly asleep
89:02 completely underneath of rock
89:05 and they woke up and what did they do
89:07 they started to suck down this media
89:09 machine
89:10 with the fake news and all this
89:11 propaganda
89:13 and now they're fighting you on the
89:14 other side of the dinner table
89:18 they don't have any knowledge about
89:20 anything they're sound
89:22 bited to beat the band and they won't
89:24 research anything because they don't
89:25 know how to do it
89:27 they don't want to be wrong so don't
89:28 lose face so they fight that too
89:32 again my definition of a liberal at this
89:34 point in my life is
89:35 research nothing know everything
89:39 that's what this guy was that i just met
89:43 interesting right all they want to do is
89:45 go to snopes.com
89:47 written run by a complete human
89:51 degenerate right i just uh recently saw
89:54 the picture of what is it um
89:57 it's this way it's a fairly convincing
89:59 picture of senator
90:01 schumer kissing a little girl in the
90:04 mouth
90:04 on some island it's a little black girl
90:08 so it's not his granddaughter
90:09 necessarily unless there's something
90:10 about his family i don't know
90:12 but maybe he has a granddaughter like
90:15 that don't know
90:18 and i went to snopes because someone
90:20 gave it to me i was like oh come on
90:22 you know let's make sure this is like so
90:24 random it doesn't really mean anything
90:25 right
90:27 and so i looked it up on snopes and it
90:28 goes this is false
90:31 you read it underneath the picture and
90:33 snopes admits well we don't know where
90:34 those photographs come from we can't
90:36 confirm or deny it
90:37 but you just denied it so what's going
90:40 on
90:42 horrible horrible extra propaganda the
90:45 dude takes paychecks from
90:46 george soros we have
90:50 an immediate need for people to feel
90:51 comfortable as who they are as human
90:53 beings
90:54 because what ends up happening is this
90:56 instead of you being a
90:58 malleable piece of clay you start to
91:03 which means people can infect you with
91:04 things if you're in that
91:06 state of change the state of flock
91:08 someone could reach into you and change
91:09 you
91:12 okay once you make a decision about who
91:14 you are
91:15 even if it's version 1.0 you harden
91:18 you get a good um resilient
91:23 shell around you now people can't
91:26 influence you so much
91:28 now what they'll do is you know if you
91:30 run into your liberal friends they'll
91:31 start calling you names and throwing
91:33 stuff
91:33 at you and whatever because you're not
91:36 like them and there's only one way and
91:37 it's the
91:38 research not they know everything way
91:42 so you got to get yourself in check
91:44 first
91:46 and then the next thing you got to do is
91:47 look around the world and go oh my god
91:51 agenda 21 was renamed agenda 2030.
91:55 go see my episode on it if you haven't
91:58 go listen to every rosa corey
92:02 interview on planet earth k-o-i-r-e
92:08 and understand that in 10 years
92:12 you won't recognize earth if they get
92:15 their way
92:17 you will think you are in some dystopian
92:20 spin-off movie from brazil by terry
92:23 gilliam
92:25 it will be the next book that was never
92:27 written by
92:29 you know george orwell
92:32 or a follow-up book to brave new world
92:34 by huxley
92:36 you will not recognize this planet
92:40 and what's going to be interesting is
92:44 if all fails and someone hears me say
92:47 that and they don't
92:48 believe it and we fail
92:52 and you managed to survive you're you're
92:54 getting your head shaved
92:56 you're getting your white robe you're
92:58 being pushed around by a
93:00 boston dynamics robot with a cow prod on
93:03 the end
93:05 and these words ring in your brain you
93:08 will think oh crap
93:10 i should have done something 10 years
93:12 ago when i had a chance
93:13 but when he told me that it could happen
93:15 in 10 years i thought
93:16 impossible as
93:19 if 2020 hasn't proven to you that
93:22 the impossible ridiculous
93:27 baseless thing that we're doing to the
93:30 world right now
93:31 could ever happen you in 2019 you
93:34 wouldn't believe me
93:36 if i told you oh we got a common cold
93:38 it's got a 0.04
93:40 death rate of a single percent you think
93:43 we shut the whole world down for that
93:44 you think we'd
93:45 crash every business in every economy
93:49 uh pull our kids out of school do you
93:51 ever think that would happen
93:52 oh no man why especially the dude i met
93:56 he would have thrown this out in the
93:57 media because he's all about feeling
93:58 comfortable in his own skin
94:00 at the expense of reality
94:03 because in 2009 we had h1n1 flew
94:07 in the united states of america 60.8
94:10 million people got infected with it
94:14 and we didn't do any of this stuff so
94:16 you're telling me just a
94:18 few million people get this most of them
94:21 are all recovering 99.6 people
94:24 percent of people are recovering no way
94:27 you're absolutely insane
94:29 you conspiracy theorists
94:33 and here we are here we are
94:38 to venezuela everything could be
94:39 venezuela hell no did brazil they could
94:42 ever be brazil
94:43 hell no
94:46 i did germany um 1930 everything it
94:49 would be germany
94:50 1945. no
94:55 ask a jew it was put on a train
94:58 they ever thought that was possible five
95:00 years before it happened
95:02 10 years before it happened 20 years
95:03 before it happened doesn't matter how
95:05 many people
95:06 you think got killed or not killed it
95:08 still happened we saw
95:09 tattoos stars all that good stuff
95:13 never thought that would happen and it
95:15 did
95:17 so this episode is geared at
95:21 centering you as a human being
95:26 some words of encouragement plus
95:28 methodologies for you to just say you
95:30 know what
95:31 he's right i just need to be myself
95:34 let the world be damned i don't hurt
95:36 people i follow common law
95:38 and on that note of common law i am now
95:41 going to reassess the entire planet
95:43 i'm going to reassess every form of
95:45 legislation
95:47 i'm going to reassess legislation that
95:49 hasn't been passed that needs to be
95:51 passed to fix big problems that we have
95:53 in our part of the world because
95:56 agenda 2030 needs to be
96:00 the scarlet letter on
96:03 everybody's chest it says this person
96:07 was duped
96:08 down to destroying all of humanity
96:13 so they need to be factored in and thus
96:16 they can
96:18 wax poetic at a podium as to how they
96:20 were once asleep
96:21 supporting the enemy
96:24 and that they've changed and they can
96:26 they can give you the full story of how
96:28 that migration occurred
96:30 and you do a background check on them
96:31 and they still don't have any
96:32 connections with these people
96:34 every day is accounted for then they can
96:37 serve the public
96:39 we have 10 years people and shit's going
96:42 to go down
96:43 way before 10 years happens guarantee it
96:47 and it's going to blow your mind and
96:49 you're not going to believe it
96:50 which is why we have to win
96:54 research everything you possibly can
96:56 when you have conversations with people
96:58 that are resisting you like the dude i
97:00 met
97:01 you know at that particular moment
97:04 here's what you do
97:05 you're not going to change that person
97:07 they made a business out of being
97:08 completely moronic in their life
97:11 but what you can do and what i did was
97:13 assess his defense techniques
97:15 and see if he came up with any new
97:17 defense techniques
97:19 this guy didn't have any new ones except
97:21 to cut me off every single time he asked
97:23 me about a conspiracy
97:24 and i started to prove it to him he cut
97:26 me off i never finished a single
97:28 sentence
97:30 he would yeah we had a third person
97:32 there too it was even more
97:34 than he was but more polite about it
97:37 anyway
97:37 and he would turn to that dude and try
97:40 to
97:41 try to get a buddy to help him out right
97:43 two votes against one
97:45 two votes against one the whole thing
97:47 and then you try to stress the fact that
97:48 they don't agree on stuff
97:49 it's like yeah genius
97:52 nobody agrees on anything completely at
97:55 all
97:56 no matter what husband and wife who go
97:58 to church
97:59 don't agree on how the bible is supposed
98:01 to be interpreted they simply don't
98:03 not the whole thing anyway and that's
98:06 humanity
98:06 because it's randomness that's why in
98:09 every sci-fi movie with an artificial
98:11 intelligence algorithm
98:13 man always throws the ai off because we
98:16 are dynamic
98:17 now maybe a big machine learn and guess
98:19 what we're going to do
98:22 but it has to really work hard at it
98:25 whereas for us
98:26 it's just ubiquitous to our nature
98:30 anyway that's this episode hope you dug
98:34 it
98:36 if you haven't been to
98:36 deepthoughtsradio.com please go i'm just
98:38 going to tell you
