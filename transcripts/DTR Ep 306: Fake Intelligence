00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today we're gonna talk about
00:39 something I'm gonna call fake
00:40 intelligence because I think it's upon
00:44 us or we need to understand what is
00:46 intelligence and what is not
00:47 intelligence you simply have to do it
00:50 what's interesting is is I've generally
00:53 been awake since 2003 but it took me all
00:59 of this time 15 years or so to really
01:03 see this absolutely as clear as a bell
01:05 the difference between what I would call
01:08 intelligence and what we might call
01:11 being smart I think it's two different
01:14 things and so I've been putting a lot of
01:17 thought into this and I think it's
01:18 important that we as individuals
01:19 understand the difference of the two and
01:22 that we spread this method to other
01:25 people so that we can all be in a room
01:27 and understand who is smart or capable
01:31 of being smart which I'm going to
01:33 classify as a person who could memorize
01:35 and repeat people on Jeopardy who win
01:37 are smart but they have not usually
01:42 proven that they're intelligent right
01:45 you memorize and repeat a bunch of
01:47 [ __ ] okay hey that's got its value
01:49 right doctors must memorize and and and
01:52 use that knowledge of how the body works
01:54 to heal us when we got a bullet wound or
01:56 we're sick and they memorize that big
01:57 pharmaceutical table in their brain most
02:00 of which is complete [ __ ] but
02:01 whatever firefighters have to remember
02:03 how to put out your house right
02:05 accessory cetera so what is intelligence
02:09 everyone should have their own form of
02:11 intelligence but I would say
02:12 intelligence is your ability to make
02:15 deductions to look at information and
02:18 pioneer into the void what doesn't exist
02:21 yet to discover things it is where we as
02:27 a species go to the next step go to the
02:30 next level it's where we preserve our
02:32 species in this gigantic universe
02:34 whatever the hell it is
02:35 right now we can have smart people by
02:38 themselves as long as they don't
02:39 [ __ ] themselves and get stuck up in
02:42 mass media products false narratives
02:46 because they have been made in
02:48 diligent falsely in the eyes of friends
02:53 and family and the population by
02:54 memorizing and repeating it's funny I
02:57 lived in the Bay Area for about 12 years
02:59 and there was someone at the friend of
03:03 Mines work who was on Jeopardy I did
03:05 really well and they talked about how
03:09 they prepared for Jeopardy and it was
03:11 reading and memorizing and reading and
03:12 memorizing all of the things that
03:14 typically come up as categories on
03:15 Jeopardy Alex Trebek or Alec Trebek is
03:20 extremely snooty about his ability to
03:23 memorize and repeat
03:24 now perhaps he's intelligence but I have
03:27 not seen him do anything that would
03:29 signify that he's intelligent right he's
03:32 smart supposedly he speaks several
03:35 different languages all right great
03:37 you've memorized and repeated how to
03:39 communicate which is awesome it's
03:41 awesome thing it's not a negative thing
03:43 that someone is smart it's just we also
03:46 need everyone to be intelligent and
03:48 here's the interesting thing you could
03:50 get on Jeopardy and be unable to answer
03:52 a single question without the other two
03:55 contestants and the public would say my
03:58 guy person is dumb but you go home and
04:02 because you're intelligent you're doing
04:05 all kinds of stuff at your house all
04:08 kinds of stuff at your job that is
04:10 absolutely beyond brilliant beyond
04:13 brilliant and this is where you get a
04:16 lot of sort of you know recluse nerds
04:20 maybe even sociopaths to different
04:22 things you could have you could be both
04:24 if you want to accidentally get caught
04:26 up in some punishment for being
04:28 different in this world but you're a
04:32 certifiable genius you're what the world
04:36 really needs at the helm of the ship
04:38 that is the human species but because
04:42 you don't know the capital of Minnesota
04:44 Society might frown on your ability to
04:46 do so how was the world structured today
04:49 150 years ago the average education went
04:52 up to about eighth grade and you stopped
04:54 and we had invention after invention
04:56 popping out of everything we had you
04:59 No all kinds of farming inventions from
05:01 people with no degrees people make cars
05:03 they made railroads engines all kinds of
05:07 stuff with just an eighth grade
05:08 education because they were intelligent
05:12 they knew the cause and effect of
05:14 combustion engines fuel air mixtures
05:17 fire spark plugs blah blah blah they
05:20 understood how to build an oven they
05:23 looked at clay ovens then they started
05:24 looking at metal ovens and they start
05:26 looking at how metal absorbs heat and
05:27 distributes it around a pizza didn't
05:31 necessarily have to have a degree but
05:34 Hollis society trained today well in a
05:38 lot of areas of the world where it
05:41 doesn't really matter they want you to
05:42 have a degree they want to know and this
05:45 isn't necessarily the employers fault
05:47 because they have been indoctrinated and
05:49 built up from people that went through
05:51 the process themselves and I'm not
05:52 saying getting the degree is a bad thing
05:53 if you don't get it in something that's
05:55 going to view you with intelligence then
05:58 what were you doing because of
05:59 memorizing and repeating is all you need
06:01 to do to get your job go buy a book
06:03 memorize and repeat it and go get your
06:04 job you don't need to lose a hundred
06:05 grand in some crappy student loan system
06:08 right but you have to have this degree
06:12 and a lot of different places again
06:14 where I live and the sectors that I work
06:16 in degrees are maybe 50 50 because they
06:20 know they need intelligence from folks
06:22 like myself and the more we are self
06:25 educated and could pioneer and invent
06:27 they're like well get that guy that guy
06:30 makes product what do we sell product we
06:33 can build services around the product
06:34 once it exists once you build a motor
06:39 inside your head that is intelligence
06:41 than you are non-stop inventing new
06:44 things and new ways to do things because
06:45 you'll find out that your endorphins and
06:47 all your dopamine is driven by this
06:51 process of inventing no matter how smart
06:55 you are and this year cliff Clavin which
06:57 is this fictional character in the epic
07:00 sitcom in America called shears who
07:03 everyone frowned upon right the guy had
07:05 at memorizing a repeating brain he was
07:06 smart and so he would sit there and you
07:10 know cough up all the stuff and of
07:12 course they littered his
07:13 his fax with a lot of untruths that were
07:16 very funny but he was he was the guy who
07:19 couldn't get a girl because all he was
07:21 doing is enamored people with his
07:23 smartness his fake intelligence I don't
07:29 know what the ratio is between smart and
07:31 intelligent as I've defined it being
07:34 smart being memorizing repeating and
07:35 intelligence being deducing and
07:37 inventing method I think it's extremely
07:40 handy to have all of the claims of the
07:43 world in a particular area memorized and
07:47 then you start to pick it apart you
07:51 start to experiment I mentioned Bruce
07:54 Lipton on this show several times he's a
07:56 great read he's a great listen he went
08:00 to medical school he was a prodigy child
08:02 everything he learned in school he took
08:04 it to the laboratory so he had his
08:05 memorizing repeating smart stuff and the
08:07 books and he would go into the
08:08 laboratory and find out holy [ __ ] this
08:11 is untrue or I'm having a problem taking
08:14 what I've learned in this memorize and
08:16 repeat realm and getting it to work in
08:18 the real world so maybe I've got it
08:19 wrong but eventually because of his
08:21 incredible intelligence was able to
08:23 prove that a bunch of what he had
08:25 learned one of which is called the dogma
08:27 theory unbelievable now in your face it
08:30 is right it wasn't true the way the
08:34 human cell worked was completely
08:36 documented incorrectly all right but he
08:40 took his findings to his tenured
08:41 professors they kicked him out like I
08:43 said several times he had to go teach in
08:44 Guam he then went and studied
08:47 epigenetics and became probably one of
08:50 the foremost authorities on the subject
08:52 we are now in a hostile situation in
08:55 this country whereby we have the deep
08:58 state taking advantage of all the
09:01 quote/unquote smart people to shove more
09:05 memorizing and repeating factoids that
09:07 are absolutely incorrect into their
09:09 minds so they believe compassionately
09:11 and passionately about the wrong things
09:16 there's no cause-and-effect models in
09:18 their brain there's very little history
09:20 in their brain and because they are apt
09:22 to believe anything that they read or be
09:24 told by certain products of the
09:26 mainstream media whether it be a
09:28 magazine television or internet or
09:32 college they immediately adopt things
09:37 that are not true and then they stop
09:41 around the world starting fires ruining
09:45 countries ruining cultures causing war
09:48 while the intelligent people are
09:50 researching everything they're
09:52 experimenting they're trying to confirm
09:53 that what they're being told actually
09:56 works now there's obviously a group of
09:59 folks that are older very few of them
10:02 are awake for the ones that are awake
10:04 that are baby boomers they get double
10:07 stars on their scorecards because they
10:09 have had to fight through more
10:10 indoctrination than any one of us down
10:12 here in the gen-x or lower realm who
10:16 have had a really bad run of life
10:17 because the bankers have constantly boom
10:21 and busted our worlds out of all success
10:23 realms I have counted on my own history
10:28 at least three opportunities I had to be
10:31 a multi multimillionaire they were
10:33 destroyed by the bankers creating these
10:35 scandals these fake recessions as I got
10:40 older the opportunities got bigger and
10:42 the losses got bigger right but it's
10:47 fueled because the world believes all of
10:49 the explanations of the scam no one's
10:55 willing to pay attention to history if
10:59 you memorize and repeat then you'll find
11:01 that you do not have a very developed
11:02 linear mind you will not have history
11:06 all in one big picture inside your mind
11:10 it can be like into a game of chess
11:13 you're gonna hear me use this analogy
11:15 probably a lot in season four because I
11:17 think it's a very powerful analogy one
11:20 jeopardy is a great way of separating
11:23 memorizers and repeaters from true
11:25 thinkers that's great again go go
11:29 download or get the Mensa Emmy NSA tests
11:34 to see if you can get into their group
11:37 you don't worry about getting into their
11:38 group but you want to take
11:40 because it will teach you with a nut
11:42 you're intelligent and there aren't any
11:45 capital city questions and [ __ ] from
11:48 Jeopardy it's real thinking but how do
11:53 you win at chess first you have to be
11:55 able to memorize the rules while a smart
11:58 person can memorize the rules right a
12:01 smart person memorizes a bunch of legacy
12:04 legendary plays they have games
12:07 memorized in their heads because they're
12:08 trying to win this on a mathematical
12:11 basis just like big blue beat the
12:14 Russian guy the Russian guy was
12:16 intelligent I'm sure he has the moves
12:18 memorized as well the moves at the end
12:20 of the movie Blade Runner are very
12:22 famous moves from a very famous game but
12:26 an intelligent person will be a person
12:29 who can defeat this brute force
12:32 artificial intelligence that is simply
12:34 playing back old plays using mathematics
12:38 to think way ahead and counteract any
12:40 move that you make such that it wins and
12:43 you loses you lose right what was the
12:47 big fictional attributes of the
12:49 fictional character james t kirk if you
12:54 watched all the movies and watched all
12:56 the series on TV you'll find at the
12:58 james t kirk at one point in his life
13:00 was given a test by the Starfleet
13:03 Academy it's a very important test the
13:07 test was designed to fail to test a
13:10 person under pressure
13:11 failing losing their crew losing their
13:14 ship failing and to see how they reacted
13:17 under pressure the james t kirk was
13:20 different he won he beat the system
13:25 because he thought instead of memorized
13:28 and repeated he used method of his
13:31 intelligence to win and even though
13:34 that's a fictional scenario that has
13:36 happened countless times and world
13:38 history I assure you I'll give you a
13:41 real world example I may have given this
13:44 once and the 300 plus episodes so if you
13:47 heard this before then you get the
13:49 trophy for having listened to a lot of
13:50 episodes I work the Electronic Arts
13:53 weeoo
13:54 the company origin which now runs
13:56 Electronic Arts the origin was famous
13:58 for making a game called Ultima Online
14:01 built off - the Ultima game that had
14:03 been around since the 80s we were the
14:06 first MMO in the world and the game went
14:11 on and on for a couple years and we're
14:15 having a problem coming up with new
14:16 content and the folks at origin came up
14:18 with a brilliant idea to overwhelm a
14:20 city with invasion from the NPC's the
14:23 non player characters that can put the
14:25 characters that the computer-controlled
14:26 were going to overwhelm the city and run
14:28 all the humans out of the city and we
14:32 have what was called shard servers their
14:34 servers that are distributed all over
14:36 the world so how every MMO works even
14:38 the ones on your telephone do this now
14:41 well in every single scenario the
14:45 zombies are the bad guys there weren't
14:48 obvious but the undead we're running
14:50 everyone out of the city successfully
14:52 was great until we got to Japan first
14:56 thing that happens the Japanese put up
14:58 an amazing fight the fight lasted a hell
15:00 of a lot longer than all the other
15:01 servers but then they did something
15:04 unprecedented using intelligence okay
15:08 they regrouped out in the forest about
15:12 everything together they strategize and
15:16 they went back in and they took the
15:18 [ __ ] city back we're sitting there
15:22 watching this with our jaws on the
15:24 ground the amount of forces that we
15:26 dumped into the city were overwhelming
15:29 it should have been mathematically
15:30 impossible for them to win but they went
15:32 back in the city and took the place back
15:34 over eventually Electronic Arts had to
15:37 swoop in and origin how to swoop in and
15:39 tell the folks hey amazing job amazing
15:42 job but we have to get you in sync with
15:44 all the other servers so we're gonna
15:46 we're gonna log you out and we're gonna
15:48 log you back in and you're not going to
15:50 be in the city and the scenario will
15:52 have taken place but you guys did
15:54 something that no one else was able to
15:55 do you won they won because they use
15:58 their brains that's the power of
16:01 intelligence versus being smart sure
16:04 they use their memorizing repeating of
16:05 the rules and how
16:07 you know weapons worked and how the
16:08 statistics work on the various
16:10 characters but they strategized to win
16:15 that's what we have to be to get out of
16:18 this
16:18 this deep state push to destroy America
16:22 so that it can be taken over by the deep
16:25 state that is already overwhelmingly
16:27 controlling pretty much every country in
16:30 this planet except for maybe Russia and
16:31 China I know that just went very
16:35 political but that's the practical
16:39 application and the practical need that
16:41 we're in now that has to take place now
16:45 the beautiful thing is is if you can
16:48 survey everyone in your life it was
16:52 debating something and provided that you
16:56 start to do your own research which is
17:00 virtually everyone who watches this show
17:01 unless you're a newcomer you will know
17:04 the difference between the two because
17:06 every single human being has done
17:08 something intelligent in their lifetime
17:09 I'm willing to bet every human being
17:12 does something intelligent every single
17:13 day at least some microscopic thing even
17:16 if they're 99% memorizer and repeater
17:20 now some point there's going to be a
17:22 ratio between the two in your brain you
17:25 do need at least all of the claims of
17:27 facts in this world so that you can
17:32 survey them and connect them and make
17:35 deductions and see if anything is really
17:38 true I think it goes without saying
17:41 hopefully but let me say it on point the
17:44 more intelligent you become the more you
17:45 rule your destiny a hundred percent you
17:50 enjoy life better very few things can
17:53 throw you for a loop because you can
17:57 think and even when something does try
17:59 to take you down when you're going down
18:02 but you know your intelligence you might
18:05 be like okay I'm a little bit of a
18:07 freefall here I didn't know this was
18:09 coming this is something new to me
18:10 wasn't in the book of memorizing and
18:12 repeating but now I'm gonna get creative
18:16 I'm gonna use my mind to defeat what is
18:20 trying to defeat me
18:20 whether it be an actual organization an
18:23 individual or it's just life flipped
18:26 around and caught you off guard now for
18:31 the baby boomers they were sitting in a
18:33 realm where life was prosperous at least
18:36 in the United States of America I think
18:37 most of the world with the first world
18:39 right so you follow the rules and things
18:41 typically worked out pretty well the
18:44 deep state was still forming around this
18:46 country right infiltrating the
18:48 government and infiltrating the military
18:50 now most of the wars that we have fought
18:53 except the Revolutionary War were
18:55 [ __ ] Wars 1812 is very real if you
19:00 look at the Civil War as a deep state
19:02 war you'll understand that war a lot
19:05 better I recently heard last night from
19:08 a friend of mine that a famous historian
19:11 of which he couldn't remember the name
19:13 said that during the Civil War the wrong
19:15 side won that's a big claim it takes a
19:19 lot more knowledge than I have to really
19:21 parse that out but I think that it was a
19:24 war that no matter which side won you
19:27 either had slavery and a bunch of
19:29 oligarchs running the plantations or you
19:33 had the bankers the Yankees up above
19:36 taking over the actual financial
19:39 sensibilities of the country which is
19:41 why Lincoln was eventually murdered for
19:44 creating the greenback outside of
19:46 European control outside of Rothschild
19:48 control war were won well they wanted
19:54 you to believe that a guy named Franz
19:56 Ferdinand who had a murder attempt on
19:57 his life
19:59 drove and dropped off his wife then
20:01 drove back to the place where he was
20:03 murdered and got murdered when he knew
20:05 someone was trying to kill him in the
20:06 first place that the whole world gave so
20:09 much of a [ __ ] that they started a world
20:11 war over this guy's death because of
20:12 allies and all these treaties and crap
20:15 complete [ __ ] 16th amendment was
20:18 passed the United States and they wanted
20:19 a war they want us to borrow money
20:21 we were xenophobes and we stayed out of
20:24 it until the last year we only think
20:26 we're in there for 11 months then we're
20:27 out the roaring 20s like I've always
20:31 said robbed all of the people from
20:33 Europe who were able to
20:35 their money over here safely and they
20:36 got lured into a bunch of bad
20:37 investments they crashed the economy on
20:40 purpose take all that money the mid 30s
20:43 while they squeeze the middle class
20:44 didn't they by 1934 you weren't allowed
20:46 to have gold in your house right few
20:49 little trinkets you could have and maybe
20:51 heirlooms and coins that were
20:54 non-functional for currency but
20:57 everything else got stolen taken off to
20:59 Fort Knox named after Philander Knox and
21:02 not the Navy admiral they give you the
21:03 [ __ ] line of most of the gold is
21:07 shipped either to New York or over seas
21:10 to our new owners of the sixteenth
21:13 Amendment right but they want us to
21:16 borrow they want us to be in a big war
21:18 so they financed one Adolf Hitler
21:23 regardless of what you think he did you
21:25 did cause a big war over there and we
21:29 went in and spent a ton of money
21:31 everybody did we also spent a bunch of
21:35 life's right as soon as that was over
21:38 boom
21:39 Korean war another [ __ ] war up was
21:41 that not even a war was a police action
21:43 that's what they called it in the
21:45 history books
21:46 so does that things over six years pass
21:48 and boom more than six years but not
21:53 much we have vietnam war
21:56 fake gulf of tonkin incidents that never
21:59 occurred but it's in a war for nine
22:01 years scar the world with vietnam vets
22:06 that's all things they should never see
22:07 the Vietcong if nothing else prove that
22:09 they are one hell of an opponent right
22:12 and then we had something called
22:14 prosperity for about 15 years little
22:19 skirmish in after an Iraq and Kuwait
22:22 then we're pretty good again the
22:24 internet starts booming in the 90s
22:26 whoever was a politician or a president
22:28 anywhere in the world during the
22:29 Internet explosion did really really
22:31 well in history books because they
22:33 presided over an economic explosion due
22:36 to a new invention called the HTTP
22:37 protocol
22:41 but then 9/11 happens and now we have an
22:46 infinite war president rumpus has been
22:50 in office less than two years and Isis
22:51 is utterly crushed out of existence john
22:55 mccain was put to death for his
22:57 involvement with isis at 4:28 p.m. just
23:02 when q' said he'd be killed put to death
23:05 for being a treasonous t criminal that's
23:09 why the military calls him no name but
23:12 how was that all possible why did i just
23:14 go through a little bit of history
23:17 because memorizing and repeating allowed
23:19 it to happen but now it's a new world
23:23 2018 s different we now have at least
23:28 two generations that have grown up
23:29 inside of 9/11 those that were born
23:33 maybe three or four years old when it
23:35 happened have no memory of existing
23:37 prior to that moment and so they lived
23:39 in a world of of terror going through
23:43 airports and being groped based on more
23:46 fake events that are only supported by
23:48 people who memorize and repeat [ __ ]
23:50 facts about why we have to take off our
23:53 shoes right consequently I went to
23:57 Australia recently and I did not have to
23:59 take off my belt I did not have to take
24:01 off my shoes did have to pull my
24:04 computer out after I landed customs was
24:07 a it was a kiosk but I walked up to that
24:10 took my picture I put my passport down
24:13 picture was taken
24:14 boom green light and I'm in amazing
24:17 there were no body scanners there were
24:20 just simple old door jamb metal
24:22 detectors you might find at a concert
24:23 here in America because that's all we
24:26 really need if you are awake you will
24:30 eventually get into a conversation I'm
24:32 sure most of you have done hundreds of
24:34 these conversations well you will bring
24:36 your absolutely deep-rooted research
24:38 into a conversation with people that you
24:41 believe are honestly interested in
24:43 debating the facts of a situation but
24:47 every time you wait for them to debate
24:49 you back what you hear is the memorizing
24:51 and repeating stuff that the mass media
24:54 gave them
24:55 Time magazine gave them that The New
24:57 Yorker gave them New York Times given
24:59 that some television show gave them
25:02 because the memorizer repeater has a
25:05 character flaw a person whose solely one
25:08 of those individuals they want to be on
25:11 the winning team regardless of what it
25:13 takes to be on the winning team and it
25:17 all boils down to a little methodology
25:21 that which is am i smart am i
25:27 intelligent well again as long as shows
25:31 like jeopardy stay on television the
25:33 world will be brainwashed into believing
25:35 that smart is intelligent again I'm just
25:41 taking that word and rebranding it in
25:43 this conversation but you know what I
25:45 mean unless a memorizing repeater every
25:47 single time I want to say something but
25:49 that's what those individuals are but
25:53 none of the people who memorize and
25:55 repeat invent anything that you love in
25:57 this world nothing right the gentleman
26:01 that discovered electricity all of them
26:06 Faraday Volta ohm Tesla working up
26:12 alternating current even Edison the
26:16 douchebag they were thinkers Madame
26:21 Curie who discovered radiation through
26:24 uranium bars she was a thinker she's
26:30 pulling film out of uh out of a desk and
26:33 developing it finding out that there
26:35 were big giant black overexposed areas
26:37 of the film because there was a uranium
26:41 bar on top of it
26:42 exposing the film through the envelope
26:44 she dies of cancer eventually from the
26:47 uranium now there's been a tremendous
26:50 amount of research and the
26:51 transformation of mankind talking in
26:54 symbols which is what we call iconic
26:57 language into phonetic language and you
26:59 hear me mention this all the time but I
27:01 have another analogy for you when it
27:03 comes to intelligence versus being smart
27:07 when you can think of time packets in
27:09 your brain step 1 step 2 step 3 step 4
27:12 you become much more powerful in this
27:14 world than anyone that is just thinking
27:15 now now now now right I have an analogy
27:19 for the the further men any of you who
27:22 have ever witnessed a boxing match and
27:23 MMA match you have seen the guy that
27:28 rushes into the fight in his brain and
27:31 had women that do this too but mostly
27:33 men they rush into the fight too quickly
27:36 and get knocked out they wake up in the
27:39 locker room in their brain it's a now
27:41 now now now now a moment I'm gonna punch
27:43 you in the face you're gonna get knocked
27:44 out and that's it but the Sugar Ray
27:47 Leonard dude who steps back and uses
27:49 intelligence and technique cleans their
27:52 clock right they wait they try to find
27:56 the weaknesses they try to find the
27:58 methodology because you can watch as
27:59 many videotapes as you want but in the
28:01 ring you start to sign oh I mean he's
28:03 dropping his elbow right after it does
28:04 that jab and Papa Papa maybe he's one of
28:07 those guys that that flaunts lowers
28:10 their lowers their defense stick Sachin
28:14 out eventually gets knocked out very
28:18 quickly usually that's the difference
28:20 between a mind that is intelligent and a
28:23 mind that's smart
28:25 now there's been exceptions to the rule
28:27 of course in some of these crazy matches
28:29 where they put a sumo wrestler against
28:30 some Kempo guy and he runs across the
28:33 room of bashes him in the temple five or
28:36 six times breaks his hand but wins the
28:37 fight hey that guy knew that if he let a
28:40 second pass because he had played it out
28:42 in his brain that guy got it got ahold
28:45 of him grabbed him and laid on him it
28:47 was over so he had to shock his head out
28:49 of existence by hitting him in the head
28:52 as quick as he possibly could some of
28:56 you know that fight and it's amazing I'm
28:58 not sure what it's like to wake up with
29:00 absolutely no intelligence but there's a
29:02 tremendous amount of young people that
29:03 are waking up every day with none
29:05 there's a lot of baby boomers that are
29:07 losing their minds because they're
29:08 getting older and they wake up with less
29:12 and less faculties something that due to
29:14 age some of that due to decades and
29:18 decades of a doctrine ation
29:21 some of its decades and decades of
29:24 fluoride for young people it's
29:26 vaccination regiments that they've had
29:28 injected in them that just eat away the
29:31 very mechanical mechanisms in their mind
29:34 to think and that's why in my opinion no
29:39 parent has the right to inject their
29:40 child with something that will affect
29:41 them for a lifetime right it's it's
29:45 illegal to kill a child so why is it
29:52 illegal to kill their mind right a lot
29:56 of us are getting off of GMOs we're
29:58 getting off of fluoride we're getting
29:59 off of microwaves and artificial
30:01 sweeteners why are we doing that because
30:04 we're trying to protect our minds our
30:06 bodies when we don't want to get sick
30:09 but - we want to be able to wake up and
30:12 look at the facts of life and look at
30:13 the new things that life has thrown at
30:15 us and be able to strategize around it I
30:18 have a good friend of mine that is in
30:21 sort of routine distress because he says
30:24 I can't understand what's wrong with
30:27 these people and what he's referring to
30:30 is that he will present to them case
30:32 after case of recent history whether it
30:36 be some fake false flag event or some
30:42 election campaign some you know
30:47 Democratic Party and what they
30:49 supposedly stand for and he shows them
30:52 the criminality of these individuals
30:54 their links to pedophilia the links to
30:57 sex cults their links to Savings and
31:00 Loan scandals right the Keating five
31:02 that McCain was all involved in and he
31:05 shows them the facts because he heard
31:08 what he was supposed to memorize and
31:10 repeat and he went and he said well
31:12 maybe it's true maybe it's not let me do
31:14 some research and of course with a lot
31:15 of the the nons who follow q and on
31:19 again q and on could be fake could be
31:22 real he did predict McCain's death to
31:24 the very minute and day we just had a
31:27 senator accidentally admit on CNN that
31:30 he was put to death
31:33 because he was put to death but he's
31:36 having a problem understanding why when
31:38 he gives them all the information that
31:40 they need with pictures okay
31:42 pictorial proof of McCain meeting with
31:45 Isis members with Paul Ryan meeting with
31:48 Isis members taking selfies look at Paul
31:51 Ryan Isis look up John McCain Isis and
31:56 you will see these [ __ ] traitors
31:58 developing an army to fight against us
32:02 to kill our soldiers and to kill our
32:04 allies and to start [ __ ] in the Middle
32:06 East okay but these individuals that he
32:11 is talking to you through social media
32:13 will not reply will not dive down an
32:16 inch into a rabbit hole now part of that
32:19 is the defense mechanism obviously
32:21 because they don't want to wake up and
32:22 find out that one they have to do
32:23 something about it but to more
32:26 importantly their ego is in is in check
32:29 because they are concerned that they
32:32 have been had their whole life which
32:34 will take their smartness total and
32:37 reduce it you haven't been smart your
32:42 whole life you certain sir as hell have
32:44 a bit intelligent your whole life as
32:46 some of that could be dude of pure
32:47 ignorance
32:48 you know remember there's the stupidity
32:50 is you've been told the truth and you
32:52 deny it that makes you stupid but some
32:54 folks have never been told anything in
32:56 southern ignorant sometimes ignorance is
32:58 bliss because it doesn't hurt a soul and
33:01 it makes your life better there's a lot
33:04 of truth to that a lot of truth to that
33:05 right there's a great analogy in the
33:09 Bible for the difference between being
33:12 smart with fake intelligence and being
33:14 truly intelligent it is the story of
33:17 Christ feeding the people they wanted
33:22 him to duplicate fish magically in
33:25 baskets so they could feed everyone who
33:27 was starving and he said well I might
33:30 handle the first round just to get
33:31 everybody satiated so you can think
33:33 better and you lack your feral mind that
33:36 you're in right now but the very next
33:38 step we're gonna do is teach you how to
33:39 fish because I'm not gonna be here to
33:42 feed all of you every single day
33:43 get off your lazy asses and learn how
33:45 to fish and what did he have to do he
33:49 had to teach them how to be intelligent
33:51 you might know the the rules of fishing
33:55 you cast out a net certain time of day
33:57 and you generally get some money so much
33:59 fish in your net but the seasons change
34:02 the conditions change and you're gonna
34:05 have to be intelligent and go well it's
34:06 not yielding as much fish as it did
34:08 yesterday
34:08 perhaps the fish have migrated oh yeah
34:12 they do this thing called migrating I
34:13 noticed this because I have a mind that
34:15 can think I can deduce things the guy
34:18 down the way there
34:19 half a mile came away with two times the
34:21 fish that I had yesterday from this
34:23 place that always supplies me at least
34:24 one unit of fish I know I'm being that
34:27 up but you get the point this has been
34:29 something that has been tried and
34:32 attempted to be driven into the
34:33 consciousness of man to be independently
34:36 powerful and we have lost sight of it
34:39 until the awakening right I mean there's
34:42 always been wonderful heroes out there
34:44 trying to get you to think always and
34:47 every nation on earth has always been
34:49 that person our persons but sadly they
34:54 are squashed by those with you know
34:57 tenure professional tracks inside
35:00 universities who want to learn one thing
35:02 40 years ago and carry that knowledge
35:05 unaltered until they died a very old
35:08 person with a big fat ass pension why
35:11 was deacon Stephen Hawking stinkin
35:14 Hawking hmm
35:15 why was Stephen Hawking celebrated so
35:18 much because he took the old ass theory
35:23 of the Big Bang and blew this and blew
35:25 the dust off and polished it up and then
35:27 with a bunch of other folks create a
35:29 bunch of you know because it was a
35:31 flawed theory to begin with so they
35:32 create dark matter to fix it you know
35:34 and they just me entered on about it but
35:36 we have to give him credit for at least
35:39 attempting to do something intelligence
35:40 even though he was categorically wrong
35:43 about the universe but it's going to
35:46 take us a hundred years to get that
35:48 piece of [ __ ] theory out of man's mind
35:50 that does it really matter how the
35:52 universe was created hmm it probably
35:55 matters more how it operates second a
35:56 second so that we can figure out where
35:58 we
35:59 if we want to travel the stars how to do
36:01 that right now the people that run the
36:04 world
36:05 are people that think and that's what
36:09 makes them better than anyone who
36:11 doesn't think it really does doesn't
36:15 make them less evil it just makes them
36:18 more equipped to run the world and they
36:22 only hire people who think Henry
36:26 Kissinger is one of them signa
36:29 Brzezinski is one of them probably Dick
36:33 Cheney Donald Rumsfeld and a bunch of
36:37 people I don't know in foreign countries
36:38 a bunch of no-name people that never get
36:40 any credit for doing anything but they
36:42 still work to master mind control of the
36:44 world because they're thinking and they
36:48 really have no opponents likes to except
36:50 for those that are waking up today which
36:52 is why there's been this gigantic
36:54 assault on all these conspiracy channels
36:58 out there that are basically thinking
37:00 day to day again the queue Inanna
37:03 movement is one of the most amazing
37:04 things to ever occur in world history
37:07 regardless of that guy is real or fake
37:10 and again I think he's pretty legit
37:12 given his John McCain prediction okay
37:14 for those of you don't know he posted 30
37:17 days before John McCain died but he
37:19 would die in 30 days at 4:28 p.m. then
37:23 we found out that a lot of his John
37:25 McCain posts all happened at 4:28 p.m.
37:27 you don't track time of death down to
37:30 the minute unless you're being executed
37:32 okay even if someone blows their brains
37:35 out they genuinely aren't there to see
37:37 it happen and you're like well they
37:38 dried up you know between 12:30 and 1:00
37:40 o'clock right the Vegas shooter the
37:43 official report on his death was he died
37:45 at 12:30 p.m. in the afternoon way
37:48 before the massacre occurred mm a little
37:51 bit of a official story that's kind of
37:54 against the narrative frame but we used
37:57 to live in little communities didn't we
37:58 we only knew about our little Township
38:00 I've said this before so we just worried
38:03 about the flood that's coming in from
38:05 last night's rained the dam busted at
38:08 the bridge and now we got a big problems
38:10 you know out east of town
38:12 i watch the flood coming to my hometown
38:14 once it's a weirdest thing because it's
38:16 really really slow but it's very
38:18 destructive this little tiny wave on the
38:21 street
38:22 I walked down from my house because my
38:23 house was elevated enough it wasn't
38:25 gonna be hit by this but I sat there and
38:27 looked at this wave on the street that
38:28 we usually use to exit north of town and
38:31 it was just a being back and forth half
38:33 an inch every time an ebb it captured
38:35 half an inch of the street and it just
38:37 kept going and going and you know an
38:39 hour later it's ten foot up the street
38:42 meanwhile the houses that are down there
38:44 in the and the deep are four feet
38:47 underwater five feet underwater etc
38:50 right but now we're in a global world
38:54 because of the internet and when you
38:56 want to be a global citizen and you kind
38:59 of find it interesting or you just just
39:01 follow it because it's there we all know
39:05 that we get our picture of the world
39:08 through mass media in almost 99% of
39:12 cases unless you're awake and then you
39:14 get some of your knowledge from cue and
39:16 on you get some of your knowledge from
39:17 one of the arteries that you like one of
39:19 the channels on YouTube that you like
39:21 maybe some podcasts that you enjoy right
39:23 at all times a good conspiracy channel
39:26 and a good conspiracy leader will tell
39:29 you hey don't believe what I say at all
39:31 I'm pointing you in a particular
39:33 direction I'm giving you the things that
39:36 I read that made me believe that there
39:38 was a conspiracy one of the key things
39:41 that you will see and experience the
39:43 more that you wake up is this notion
39:45 that people will accuse you that you're
39:47 happy that there are conspiracies that
39:49 have existed in the past and ones that
39:51 are going on right now and the ones that
39:53 may end up turning on in the future
39:55 they think that you're happy that things
39:58 are upside down when they're thrilled to
40:01 death that they're memorizing and
40:03 repeating ritual has accepted all of
40:06 these fake narratives all this fake
40:09 revisionist history they like that
40:12 people died in in these false Flags they
40:15 want the children to be dead right that
40:18 makes them feel good well I memorized
40:20 how many kids died I feel better at
40:22 night going to bed believing all this
40:24 negative stuff
40:25 when your conspiracy person's going hey
40:27 hey hey wait wait wait
40:29 those were crisis actors in some cases
40:31 not all cases I think they really do
40:34 kill people today but there have been
40:37 false flags in the past where no one
40:39 died gulf of tonkin two naval conflicts
40:44 with the Vietcong that never occurred it
40:47 started the Vietnam War how many people
40:50 died in that war how many people
40:53 suffered mental problems PTSD times ten
40:56 when they came home hundreds of
40:59 thousands
41:00 how many foreign people died and the
41:03 hundreds of thousands if not millions of
41:04 people because of these narratives that
41:07 are handed down why you should hate
41:08 someone why you should support a war
41:12 memorizers and Peter's memorizers and
41:15 repeaters that are directed by those
41:17 that are the thinker's that run the
41:18 world are the ones that enable all the
41:21 evil to occur on this planet and it's
41:24 evil if you were to be a mathematician
41:28 and a spiritualist and you would say as
41:32 a spiritualist all I'm going to do is
41:34 say do no harm as the mechanism by which
41:37 the world should be ruled those who do
41:40 harm to others especially for their
41:42 benefit or the benefit of their
41:44 employers are the evil ones and those
41:47 that do no harm are the good ones you
41:50 will find out two interesting facts
41:55 99.9% of the world is good but none of
41:59 them run the world the 1% are pure
42:04 disgusting [ __ ] evil they are evil on
42:09 levels that we can we have to struggle
42:11 to fathom the things that they do to
42:14 children the things they do to each
42:16 other and the things they do to us right
42:20 so is it important to become intelligent
42:24 well to the degree that we can now say
42:27 unequivocally that for decades probably
42:31 centuries and maybe even millennia evil
42:35 has run this planet
42:37 and it's not simply a misunderstanding
42:39 of well the people just simply don't
42:41 understand they're too dumb to
42:42 understand what's good for them and so
42:44 we have to do some hard things every
42:45 once in a while to preserve the overall
42:48 good bubble that is the 99% it's not
42:52 just that right wars for centuries have
42:57 been waged simply to keep the attention
43:00 off the leadership and to keep the
43:03 people fighting each other the Colosseum
43:06 is over two thousand 18 years old
43:09 right it's actually older now that goes
43:11 like 40 BC that what is it titus flavius
43:14 launched the first Colosseum somewhere
43:16 in that room right that was to make the
43:19 people go to a sporting event to be
43:21 entertained to satiate their internal
43:24 anger with the way that their area was
43:26 being run by the Roman Empire and they
43:29 could focus it vicariously on a
43:31 gladiator killing a Christian or a lion
43:34 ripping apart a person now it's just
43:37 sports aggressive sports he always blows
43:43 my mind at the end of a football soccer
43:45 match how many of the citizens the fans
43:48 who like those teams riot and fight and
43:52 kill people in the streets after a game
43:55 is that a mystery is that a mystery that
43:58 this is satiating some primal anger and
44:02 man because they have a shitty job they
44:04 have low income their life isn't going
44:06 the way that the picture book said right
44:09 the fairy tale of life is a fairy tale
44:12 it's not true now if we start thinking
44:16 if the snowball of awaken as' which i
44:20 think is starting to reach a 50% markup
44:22 so that for a couple years I actually
44:23 think that people waking up are starting
44:26 to become very active in spreading their
44:28 knowledge because that's something
44:30 that's like like when you memorize and
44:32 repeat unless you're on Jeopardy winning
44:35 money for doing something yeah maybe
44:37 you're a dentist learned how teeth work
44:39 maybe you're a brain surgeon learn how
44:41 the brain works I'm sure there's some
44:43 hellish job satisfaction in that but I
44:47 think if you took a person 20 years in
44:48 dating one of those jobs the dentist's
44:50 which have one of the
44:51 suicide rates in the world you think
44:53 even surpassing psychologists well now
44:57 wait a minute
44:58 if memorizing and repeating and using
45:00 that smart knowledge is so satisfying
45:02 then why do these people want to kill
45:03 themselves there's a lot of deep
45:07 psychology that routes in with each one
45:09 of those professions right I talked to a
45:11 dentist once and I said why do you think
45:12 there's such high suicide rates with
45:13 dentist he said because people blame us
45:16 because they don't take care of their
45:18 [ __ ] teeth and they hate us they
45:21 don't want to feel pain in their mouth
45:22 even though we've got all that solved
45:24 right there's no reason for anyone to
45:25 feel any pain anymore regardless if
45:27 we're pulling every single tooth out of
45:28 their mouth and putting in implants we
45:30 can keep them out of that pain pocket
45:31 for a lot of it it may be embarrassing
45:33 that they've neglected themselves and
45:36 have to have dentures but we have
45:38 methods of even dealing with that
45:40 psychology with the patient themselves
45:41 right but I tell you some of the
45:45 happiest people I meet in this planet or
45:48 inventors with maybe a lot of money and
45:51 maybe no money when you have smart
45:55 knowledge that feeds the intelligent
45:57 knowledge you have a perfect balance you
46:00 have a perfect life and it doesn't
46:02 matter what you're doing doesn't matter
46:03 how much money obviously need enough
46:04 money to pay your bills and take care of
46:06 the things that you love in this world
46:07 to a at least a minimum critical mass
46:10 right my friend Syd Mead who's a you
46:14 know this amazing futuristic designer he
46:17 has worked on I don't know thousands and
46:20 thousands of projects from movies to
46:22 product design to car design ship design
46:25 you know airliner Jets all the stuff
46:29 clothing snowboards watches everything
46:32 in the world he learned how to be
46:37 creative with his mind
46:41 he also has a tremendous amount of
46:43 memorized facts about the world that he
46:46 then gets creative with right he has
46:50 lived a charmed life because of the mix
46:52 between the two and that's what each and
46:54 every single one of us deserve now for
46:59 those of you seen the movie matrix you
47:01 know that there's this funny part in the
47:02 movie where they Jam a wire in the back
47:06 of Neos neck and they download or upload
47:10 to his mind excuse me kung fu pull the
47:14 thing out and he looks at the woman he
47:16 goes I know kung foo boom
47:18 he knows kung fu and he knows it at a
47:20 master's level right all right the
47:25 problem with this intelligence thing is
47:27 that you don't have that mechanism
47:29 you've got to actually study and so you
47:34 might ask yourself well Jesus I like
47:35 this whole idea yeah you're right I you
47:37 know the people that confront me with
47:39 their bad political policies it's all
47:41 about telling me what the mass media
47:43 told them to believe so they're not
47:46 thinking they're not doing any research
47:47 well I can't fix them because I can't
47:49 put a wire in the back of their brain
47:51 but the other thing is you can't put it
47:53 in your own brain and so what you need
47:56 to do is focus on what you love some of
47:59 you love various conspiracy theories and
48:02 you go for it at a huge level right some
48:05 of you are addicted to the moon landings
48:07 some of you are addicted to Flat Earth
48:08 some of you are addicted to UFOs some of
48:12 you are addicted to the the nitty-gritty
48:14 of how to run capitalism in a country
48:18 how free trade should work whatever
48:22 whatever you love is where you should
48:24 probably focus your intelligence meaning
48:28 your critical thinking and your
48:29 questioning right the question mark is
48:31 probably the single symbol that we could
48:33 put forth that would be the symbol that
48:36 starts this process of exploring your
48:40 intelligence ask a question sometimes
48:43 you're born with a very curious mind and
48:46 I'm not sure how that occurs maybe it's
48:49 just a bunch of serendipitous things
48:50 that happen to you as a child and you're
48:52 just an inquisitive being
48:54 sometimes it's that you've witnessed
48:56 things become lies and so you're like
48:59 well it wasn't like they said you know
49:02 when I had my parents divorce at nine
49:04 years old I was nine and I think my dad
49:07 was 32
49:10 my mom was 29 somewhere in there maybe
49:13 31 she's 29
49:14 they got divorced and I watched they
49:18 were very good friends after they
49:19 divorced by the way so I was a very
49:21 lucky child with that whole thing I
49:22 never felt like they disliked each other
49:23 at all it just couldn't agree on certain
49:25 things but I learned at nine that my
49:28 parents were still children that they
49:32 still had flaws I don't mean there were
49:34 babies I mean you know like an infant's
49:37 you know pouting or something but you
49:41 know you know that you have childish
49:43 things about you that you would remove I
49:44 certainly have a whole you know
49:46 collection of my own behaviors that I'm
49:48 like ah why did I bother I just do that
49:50 what I tell that joke or why did I blow
49:52 you know fly off the handle or something
49:54 when I shouldn't have right that taught
49:56 me at a really young age things aren't
49:58 the way they say they are and - I'll put
50:04 it this way my parents divorced because
50:07 of pop culture coming out of the 70s the
50:12 indoctrination of women the doctrine
50:14 ation of men what men should focus on
50:17 the way that banking work the way the
50:20 credit cards worked the way that you
50:24 know the child was deprioritized in the
50:27 name of the parent was the reason why I
50:30 ended up with no brothers or sisters and
50:33 two parents that were divorced so as I
50:36 got older I was like wow that actually
50:38 ripped my family apart but there's an
50:41 interesting silver lining to that whole
50:42 thing my friends that grew up in their
50:46 households with their parents and have
50:47 plenty of brothers and sisters typically
50:49 grow up very shallow very maybe smart
50:54 maybe right life was a book in a list of
50:58 rules that you could follow you just
50:59 check things off got this got this got
51:01 married got the health but papaw got my
51:02 debt and I did my TRW reading I got one
51:06 boy one girl papa
51:07 and they've lived blissful life's and in
51:11 most cases and that's fantastic I don't
51:13 mean to take anything away from that
51:14 that's where ignorant is bliss right but
51:18 I was being tossed around you know
51:20 several different schools several
51:21 different states I moved to California
51:23 at 17 by myself with no money and so I
51:27 had to you know get my [ __ ] together
51:29 fast but I was always a scrapper right
51:32 where I lived unless I lived in my
51:35 hometown which I think I only only
51:37 finished about about seven or eight
51:40 years in my hometown the rest was spent
51:43 in other cities before I got to you know
51:45 graduate and take control my own life I
51:47 was enlightened by the process because
51:50 at all times to survive and be happy I
51:52 had to figure out a way to see more I
51:54 was raising myself I think pretty much
51:59 from the age of nine up maybe even
52:02 before that I've told you plenty of
52:04 stories where I was in you know Cub
52:05 Scouts as a kid with no father because
52:07 he was working two jobs to try to pay
52:09 for all the things that he wanted in
52:10 life because life said you should have
52:12 all these things you need all these
52:13 things right it's an innocent mistake
52:15 and it's what society said to do and
52:17 every dude on every single block was
52:19 exactly the same at that time right my
52:22 father was not unique in any way so when
52:26 it came time to digest things like boom
52:28 and bust cycles to digest conspiracies
52:32 that were brought to me by the people
52:33 that maybe weren't directly involved but
52:37 they inherited some of the lies like the
52:39 moon landing
52:40 when I got debriefed as a kid at 20 21
52:45 years old that we didn't go to the moon
52:46 by two guys from NASA who are as deep in
52:48 NASA as you could possibly go - running
52:50 the organization itself you know it was
52:54 one I was not able to go through my full
52:58 kubler-ross effect right so I wasn't
53:00 able to completely accept it but later
53:02 when bart sibrel made his video and
53:04 echoed what they had said and put it in
53:06 picture form and showed me the video
53:08 evidence I woke up very quickly because
53:13 I've always had to look at things
53:14 differently because they didn't have
53:16 someone spoon-feeding me money who
53:18 wouldn't spewed fitting me you know
53:20 my resources in life cars and shelter
53:23 and education
53:24 none of it I had to do by myself
53:27 and a lot of you are just like me he's
53:31 probably why you watch the show a little
53:32 bit that's your sign of intelligence
53:37 most of the comments in the comment
53:40 section on the YouTube channel for those
53:41 of you are coming through iPod they're
53:43 brilliant brilliant people and you don't
53:47 have to appreciate everything that
53:50 people say I've seen some videos from
53:53 listeners that are very different than
53:56 me they have different opinions about
53:57 drugs than I do and drinking that I do
53:59 but they are at least analyzing their
54:02 life and for them some of those
54:03 regiments have been extremely empowering
54:06 and enlightening for them they've had
54:08 things like alcohol expand their mind I
54:10 have not had that experience right but
54:14 I've had acid to expand my mind and the
54:17 amount of people that are fearless about
54:19 getting you know falldown drunk angry
54:22 drunk but they're terrified of taking a
54:24 hit of acid it's interesting again if
54:27 you have a lot of skeletons in your
54:28 closet you probably should take it to
54:30 you get some of those worked out but
54:31 it's interesting again we're told things
54:35 that are very destructive to our body
54:36 are okay or just a fact of life well
54:40 things that don't touch our body at all
54:42 except in the moment that it's flowing
54:44 through our body oh those are super evil
54:46 and man you should never take it why
54:48 because they'll expand your mind drugs
54:50 that expand your mind to the most
54:51 illegal drugs on this planet that leave
54:54 nothing in your body once you're done
54:56 with it oh you'll be tired the next day
54:58 and you know you you'll be get if you
55:01 take acid your brain will be kind of
55:02 really mellow for a few days because
55:04 you've you've exhausted a tremendous
55:07 amount of chemicals in your mind but
55:10 you're done and when you're done you're
55:11 done and you can't really abuse it
55:13 because your mind will cancel it out
55:14 then where you take it I think most
55:16 human beings whether or not they realize
55:18 it or not want to be in control of their
55:19 life even those that memorize and
55:21 repeater desperately trying to create a
55:22 paradigm of existence that is I go to
55:25 work I get this money I bring it home I
55:26 paid this bill and I live this life I
55:28 like watching football on this day like
55:30 my Thanksgiving you look like this my
55:32 Christmas look like that and boom I
55:34 it's been a good life and again for a
55:37 lot of folks that works great that
55:39 they're satisfied that's fine as long as
55:41 they don't contribute to the evil that
55:44 is running this world and today it's
55:49 pushing in the evil camps are getting
55:52 caught and so they are trying to fight
55:54 back at a level that is never been seen
55:57 on planet earth except for maybe during
55:59 inquisitions or super stages of tyranny
56:03 and developed Europe which is why
56:05 America exists in the first place right
56:07 it's interesting when I hear individuals
56:09 talk about their country and all the
56:11 socialistic programs that control their
56:13 lives they can't do anything without
56:15 citing the rules of their country and
56:19 then I sit there and I might mention
56:21 well I prefer personally to control my
56:25 life and to be left alone as much as
56:27 possible I don't like a bunch of state
56:29 taxes on top of me to pay for a bunch of
56:30 weird you know palaces and the ruling
56:35 politicians lifes right because they're
56:38 laundering my money into their systems
56:40 slush funds and all kinds of weird
56:43 pork-belly spending building bridges
56:46 that don't need to be built
56:47 rebuilding highways that are brand-new
56:49 filtering money into their husband or
56:51 wife's foundations or businesses with no
56:53 big contracts right that's why
56:56 governments get huge because corruption
56:58 there's almost an absolute result of a
57:02 big government one interesting thing
57:04 about the the Internet has a metaphor
57:09 towards a country is that the Internet
57:13 has been built
57:13 ever since the tcp/ip protocol was
57:16 invented and you don't need to know
57:18 exactly how that works except to say
57:20 that when they first built a wired
57:22 computer network in the United States of
57:25 America through the military industrial
57:26 complex they realized that if one of the
57:29 cities got bombed did everything that
57:32 routed through that city was not going
57:33 to get routed anymore so one big chunk
57:36 of the network could be cut off from the
57:38 other chunk of the network right so East
57:40 Coast could lose West Coast
57:42 communication
57:44 they thought that's not a really good
57:46 design so they came up with this
57:48 mechanism that was completely redundant
57:50 if one computer died all the other
57:52 computers could contribute to route the
57:54 information around the damaged part of
57:56 the network you see this all the time if
57:59 a bunch of hubs go out in Los Angeles we
58:01 don't necessarily lose the internet it
58:03 just gets really really slow it's slow
58:05 because all those packets are going
58:07 through other computers that are already
58:10 carrying the load of that particular
58:11 region so it gets overwhelmed and takes
58:13 longer to satiate your request for
58:15 information if you bring up a web page
58:17 right well the government is built like
58:20 the old network if one part goes out the
58:22 whole thing dies and that's what's wrong
58:25 with government it's not redundant the
58:29 citizens of the world should be
58:30 empowered to run their regions as they
58:32 see fit as long as they follow they do
58:35 no harm principle right there's this
58:38 weird notion there is almost like
58:43 Catholic guilt that if you don't want to
58:46 be a globalist you are a bad person
58:51 meaning if you're sitting in Los Angeles
58:56 you have to care about the kid in him
58:58 and Cambodia you have to even though
59:01 it's very little you could ever do to
59:03 affect that person's life you're
59:04 supposed to care you're supposed to
59:06 mourn you're supposed to cry you can't
59:09 stop hurricanes around the world
59:10 destroying areas sure you can contribute
59:12 some money here and there but they're
59:15 gonna rebuild according to their specs
59:16 right there's this notion of poverty in
59:21 the world it's very very interesting and
59:22 when you talk to people in those regions
59:23 who are from those regions and thanks to
59:26 uber you get to meet a tremendous amount
59:29 of people from around the world
59:30 if you travel the world you get to meet
59:31 them face to face but they will argue
59:33 with me and I'm never I'm never arguing
59:37 with them but they argue to me I should
59:38 say that a lot of the poverty indexes in
59:43 the world are bunk they're wrong and so
59:49 I say okay I like where you going with
59:51 that explain and they said well
59:55 like I met a driver the other day that
59:57 lived in the jungles of Vietnam that's
60:00 where he came from and he was telling me
60:03 that he was gonna move back soon but
60:05 here he is driving it was here in
60:09 Southern California and he was telling
60:12 me I said well what do you think about
60:13 all this city stuff this this traffic
60:15 and all the amenities that you might
60:17 have in a big city and he says you know
60:18 what I don't need it neither does anyone
60:20 where I come from he said we are happy
60:23 as can be and he goes but when you take
60:26 the amount of money that we make on a
60:27 daily basis slash monthly basis it's
60:29 nothing he goes I make that in a day
60:31 here driving my car but he said they're
60:35 happier where they are which is why I'm
60:37 moving back I have friends from China
60:40 that tell me that the poverty index of
60:42 how much money someone makes has nothing
60:45 to do with their happiness and their
60:46 fulfillment in life they're not
60:47 suffering they have a standard that
60:50 they've grown up with and that's their
60:52 standard we think my god they don't have
60:54 a 70 inch 4k HDR tail a television they
60:57 are suffering so much they don't have a
60:59 [ __ ] iPhone so we have to force that
61:01 on them right again what this man was
61:06 sharing with me in the car was
61:08 intelligence he had been fed the
61:13 propaganda of prosperity but he used his
61:17 intelligence to prorate that right I
61:21 think in large part what he wasn't
61:24 saying was that he was feeling his heart
61:26 having changed since he joined modern
61:29 society right what's the big thing that
61:32 you know first world countries use as a
61:34 rationale to conduct Wars all around the
61:37 world they say we are spreading
61:40 democracy that's what we're doing
61:42 getting rid of communism all right not a
61:46 big fan of communism trust me it's a
61:47 socialistic platform right I have never
61:50 really met a communist that's super
61:52 duper happy but some of them do accept
61:57 it and they find a way to be happy
61:58 within it but in a lot of cases what we
62:01 do is we spread work
62:06 debt and taxes the world is being
62:09 transformed into a gigantic Factory
62:12 right I used to have a friend in Silicon
62:16 Valley that used to pack up his things
62:17 he'd work for two years with his wife
62:19 and they'd save all their money and they
62:20 lived as destitute as they possibly
62:22 could
62:23 extremely intelligent people okay but
62:26 they would leave and they would move to
62:27 an island they had four or five islands
62:29 that they liked in the Pacific and they
62:32 would live for one year at a time they
62:34 tried to see how much they could get out
62:36 of their money I think the number that
62:38 they would save up was around $60,000 so
62:41 they put that in the bank they moved to
62:42 these islands obviously consuming a
62:44 little bit of the money to get there but
62:46 he said my day was my day is when I'm
62:49 there throwing out a net fishing fishing
62:54 until I had more food than I needed for
62:55 that particular period of time which
62:57 that food would exist I don't know what
62:59 how long fish would last but he says I
63:01 sold the rest the fish at the market
63:03 making more money to pay my rent and
63:07 they said that the last stent that they
63:10 had had this is in the mid-90s when he
63:11 was telling me this the last cent they
63:13 had they actually chose to come home
63:14 because of some family issues you know
63:16 people dying and getting sick they would
63:18 have stayed but they had found a method
63:20 of being fully sustainable in these
63:22 islands now one of the guys was a very
63:24 tech savvy guy so I think he kind of
63:27 feels the need to contribute back to the
63:28 tech world he doesn't want to lose all
63:30 of his skills and you know become
63:31 unemployable when he comes back so this
63:33 ritual would end on his on his lack of
63:36 you know relevance in the industry that
63:39 he was in he was a programmer the world
63:41 needs help doesn't it it always needs
63:44 help this is not just a phase if again
63:46 we're ever able to rebuild society from
63:48 the ground up with a good righteous do
63:52 no harm
63:53 methodology that is in place we don't
63:56 want it to be run but by a global istic
63:58 socialism platform we simply can't
64:00 afford to let that happen
64:02 because that does not that is a
64:04 contradictory method of living that the
64:06 self has power and the thing is is again
64:12 like I've always made the analogy every
64:14 time a company ever gains a foothold on
64:18 technology
64:19 they cease to create new technology
64:22 don't they Microsoft may you know they
64:24 were comfortable with Microsoft Windows
64:26 and then they stopped innovating Windows
64:27 and then everybody who owns Windows
64:29 which is the majority of the world was
64:31 suffering while Apple under Steve Jobs
64:34 rebirth of the company started
64:36 experiencing new things that no one had
64:38 ever experienced before you know
64:40 Microsoft wanted to deny that the
64:41 internet existed they were the last
64:43 browser to exist Explorer right well
64:45 chrome came eventually but Apple through
64:48 Steve Jobs and his his next operating
64:51 system knowledge had explored the
64:52 Internet and figured out all the
64:54 interoperability and you know office
64:56 communication with enclosures and emails
64:58 and all that stuff while everyone else
64:59 was ignoring it right so a bunch of a
65:02 player intelligent people took us to the
65:05 next level well that's just in
65:09 technology we need a player's play in
65:12 every game that can be played on this
65:14 planet finding better zero-point energy
65:16 systems finding cures to cancer killing
65:19 cancer off altogether by not feeding us
65:21 crappy food but maybe not electrifying
65:23 all the air such that we are constantly
65:26 bombarded all the time by things that
65:29 manipulate the health of our blood the
65:30 health of our DNA we see the benefits of
65:35 communicating with each other using
65:37 these devices we see the benefit of
65:39 perhaps a preference in food is you know
65:42 sweet or something that we shouldn't
65:44 probably eat but if we don't let the
65:48 intelligent people prosper and become
65:50 those intelligent people then these
65:52 things will continue to become unhealthy
65:54 on every major bowl metric of existence
65:58 right not just your health but your
66:01 intelligence but your knowledge your
66:03 fulfillment in life maybe we become
66:07 super intelligent and decide as a an
66:08 intelligent race to go backwards in time
66:11 say look it looked pretty good in the
66:12 50s didn't it everything was very simple
66:15 everybody was very sweet to each other
66:16 we didn't have comedians going up and
66:19 making pedophile jokes and getting paid

66:23 get desensitized to it such that when
66:25 politicians or their CEOs get caught

66:49 want you to take away from this is when
66:51 you hear someone speak especially in a
66:54 debate of any kind or you're passionate
66:56 about your side of the game one make
66:59 sure that you're not just forming your
67:01 opinion based on things that you've been
67:02 told if what you say back to another
67:05 person is something you read out of a
67:06 magazine book or something what you
67:07 better have done your due diligence to
67:09 make sure that what you're repeating is
67:11 actually your opinion and that it
67:12 actually works in the real world right
67:15 look for the jeopardy people people that
67:18 just know the capital of Minnesota but
