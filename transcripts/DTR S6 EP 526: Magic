00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:27 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts it's about uh
00:40 2 20 in the morning
00:43 my little neighborhood across the street
00:46 the neighbors are still partying
00:49 just chilling out being quiet with each
00:51 other
00:53 so i was thinking about you know who to
00:55 or what to talk about i should say
00:58 i had a really good evening going to a
01:01 uh
01:02 a restaurant i helped back in the day
01:05 over 12 years ago
01:06 you screw all the time they're open
01:09 again
01:10 people inside everybody singing was
01:12 amazing
01:13 amazing but i came home
01:16 turned on the youtubes and found an old
01:20 lecture
01:21 little ted lecture by james randy
01:25 r-a-n-d-i we'll go to his website
01:29 r-a-n-d-i dot org apparently he just
01:32 passed away this year
01:34 i think it was uh posted on october 20th
01:37 or so
01:38 that he just passed away he is the
01:41 gentleman with the white beard
01:42 who was a skeptic society guy
01:46 and i've kind of been referring to his
01:50 life i guess you could say in several my
01:53 episodes over the years
01:54 anytime i talked about the skeptic
01:56 society i'm really talking about james
01:58 randy
01:59 very eccentric guy i was wondering my
02:03 fingertips seem a little colder today
02:05 so i was like damn well it's 42 degrees
02:07 so we're down four degrees from
02:08 yesterday
02:10 so james randy is the guy that caught my
02:13 attention
02:14 many many decades ago when i was a kid
02:17 especially
02:18 like almost everyone's seen the guy do
02:19 his thing
02:21 he called himself a conjurer and not a
02:24 magician
02:25 even though he knew how to be a magician
02:27 too and the reason being is he said a
02:29 magician is someone who can
02:31 create real magic and a conjurer
02:34 it's just someone who can give you the
02:36 illusion of magic
02:38 i kind of dig that distinction
02:42 and so this speech he gave for a ted
02:45 talk
02:46 which is brilliant and funny
02:49 shows us very quickly
02:53 some of the assumptions that we make as
02:56 human beings
02:58 if you see it he holds a little black
03:00 thing up to his face and he keeps
03:02 talking into it and talking into it and
03:04 eventually
03:04 two minutes and he's like and by the way
03:06 this isn't a microphone
03:08 and he says most of you think i'm
03:09 looking at you and the audience and he
03:11 goes uh
03:11 because i've been told you guys are out
03:13 there he goes honestly
03:15 i need to wear glasses and he's got
03:17 glasses on he takes his glasses off and
03:18 he puts his two fingers
03:20 through where the lenses would be and he
03:21 goes i'm wearing frameless glasses
03:24 he goes why would i do that he said
03:26 because
03:29 you assume they're real but they're not
03:32 he goes that's how i got you i thought
03:35 that was brilliant
03:37 he says you know we have a bag of tricks
03:41 that we use to be magicians
03:43 to be called magicians but really just
03:44 conjurers
03:48 and then there's that that question
03:50 about magic
03:53 it's such an open-ended thing but before
03:56 the ted talk was over he reiterated
03:58 his organizations
04:02 offered to the public
04:05 to prove anything supernatural in front
04:07 of a
04:08 group of people who could analyze and
04:10 make sure there's no trickery
04:13 he talks about a bunch of people who
04:16 who should step up to the plate and
04:18 prove something
04:19 and then he talks about the one sylvia
04:21 woman
04:24 who did actually say she was going to
04:26 take the million dollars that they offer
04:29 but then she stepped back and never came
04:32 to take the money
04:34 and then what was interesting about the
04:35 presentation which will sort of be the
04:37 framework of this conversation that
04:39 we're going to have
04:40 is that you hear sort of a george carlin
04:44 against religion version of his
04:47 philosophy against
04:50 any of these folks that in his mind
04:54 give billions of dollars a year
04:57 collectively
04:58 around the continent or and around the
04:59 world excuse me to be told
05:02 things about people who are dead
05:05 do you have astrology and numerology all
05:08 predicted for them
05:10 and it's interesting because i'm sitting
05:12 there watching this guy
05:15 who at the end of the presentation was
05:17 we really need to take legal action
05:19 against these
05:20 people who claim that they can do things
05:22 that they can't do
05:24 because he said you know in one way or
05:26 another
05:27 you don't go to a doctor who claims that
05:29 they can cure you and they can't and
05:30 then you pay them money and the answer
05:32 is
05:33 i mean the reality is the hell we don't
05:38 many times people tell you they're gonna
05:39 heal your
05:41 loved ones and then die why do we have
05:44 to get second
05:45 opinions all the time about diagnosis
05:49 because we get bad ones when obamacare
05:52 was
05:53 facing extinction at the transition in
05:57 2016 to 2017 to a new president
06:01 the medical industry in this country
06:04 engaged in an epic level of fraudulent
06:06 diagnoses
06:07 to extort out of their obamacare
06:12 patients surgeries that they did not
06:14 need
06:15 and i've said it a couple times a good
06:17 friend of mine was told he had
06:19 muscle invasive bladder cancer they were
06:21 going to cut his bladder out they were
06:23 going to use his intestine to create
06:24 another bladder
06:25 he was going to suffer all kinds of side
06:28 effects that would have pretty much
06:29 ended any pleasure in his life
06:32 but he took he took it upon himself to
06:35 get a second opinion
06:37 it just so happens he lives in los
06:38 angeles and he found a
06:40 specialist one of the world specialists
06:42 on bladder cancer and they did
06:44 they studied the biopsy it was taken
06:46 from the previous group plus they took a
06:47 new one they said you don't have
06:49 what they're saying you have one of the
06:51 most mild versions of irregularity
06:53 cellular irregularity
06:56 they gave them some shots for
06:57 tuberculosis
07:00 which were very painful but then they uh
07:03 are sorry the shots weren't painful but
07:05 the uh
07:06 the follow-up exploratory surgery goes
07:08 through your urethra so
07:10 that's not pleasant but he was happy to
07:12 find out he was okay
07:14 but he pulled me up to his house and
07:17 told me he might be dying
07:20 and this is like one of my best friends
07:21 in the whole world and so i'm like what
07:23 you know so he's fine today because
07:26 doctors lie all the time
07:29 but they've got legal mechanisms to hide
07:31 in their false diagnoses
07:36 so what's the difference again between a
07:37 person who claims to have
07:39 psychic abilities or astrology knowledge
07:42 or numerology or tarot cards or anything
07:46 not sure i'm trying to develop an
07:50 episode that will get at the
07:52 root of human beings and causes
07:55 because there is some bizarre euphoric
07:58 thing about a cause
08:02 some are good some are bad
08:05 but they're so intoxicating that i i
08:08 tend to believe that
08:09 even if they had no benefit to society
08:12 it doesn't matter to some of these
08:13 people get intoxicated in them
08:15 in fact it could be their own demise as
08:16 we've seen in 2020.
08:19 unbelievable strangling the oxygen
08:20 supply to their body
08:24 destroying their immune systems and then
08:26 getting really
08:28 sick permanently destroying their brains
08:32 unbelievable now what's interesting
08:35 about
08:36 magic in general is that there's this
08:39 era in your life
08:40 as a child typically depending on where
08:43 you come from now maybe someone is real
08:45 brutal with you when you're young
08:47 and there's not any experience of this
08:50 but i think that even if you're in a
08:52 world where adults are abusing you and
08:54 saying there is no magic there is none
08:55 of this there is none of that
08:58 you still retreat with your mouth closed
09:02 into a world of possible magical
09:04 solutions to this
09:06 hideous punishment that's going on
09:09 so then you let's just say you had a
09:12 fairly balanced
09:15 world some village or something
09:18 and maybe you dial it back in your brain
09:20 60 000 years or whatever
09:22 whatever's appropriate for this analogy
09:26 you're living life pretty functionally
09:28 you're getting up and getting the water
09:30 and
09:30 the food and hunting and killing and
09:32 cleaning and feeding your people
09:34 and taking care of the pregnant women
09:36 taking care of the babies just
09:37 just everything is working out really
09:39 well you finally found some balance
09:42 maybe even this balance has gone a few
09:43 hundred years undisturbed
09:46 and then this concept of magic whether
09:49 you have the word for it or not
09:51 starts to surface as an elder of the
09:54 village you might say
09:56 okay what is this stuff you're talking
09:57 about well
10:00 someone is making claims now within the
10:02 village
10:03 or maybe some neighboring village which
10:05 is still fairly peaceful
10:08 that they're able to do things that
10:10 we've never seen anyone do
10:13 maybe it's flying maybe it's healing
10:15 maybe it's
10:17 talking to the dead
10:20 and so you as an elder
10:24 have choices on how you deal with this
10:27 you might see it outright as heresy
10:30 if it's ever been in the past and caused
10:32 issues you might just roll it straight
10:34 up to heresy
10:35 get rid of those people they're
10:37 disturbing the peace we don't need
10:39 anything else right guys
10:40 i mean let me just open up the
10:43 conversation
10:44 you know you're talking to your village
10:46 elders and you're like is there anything
10:47 we're missing is anyone unsatisfied
10:50 is there an area where we are suffering
10:52 that we need to create a solution for
10:54 that this
10:54 magic stuff supposedly claims
10:57 capabilities
10:58 and everyone says no i don't think we're
11:00 having any problems at all
11:03 and you're okay so we're all in
11:04 agreement yeah all right
11:06 and then you would go on a campaign to
11:08 explore the claims
11:10 and try to do what james randy did which
11:12 was try to figure out
11:14 deception now that'd be a very
11:18 left-brained approach to the issue
11:21 now perhaps if you're a little bit more
11:22 open-minded you might actually say
11:24 something to the effect of
11:26 all right well you know what if this
11:28 stuff really works i mean what are they
11:30 claiming again
11:32 healing they can heal you yeah we
11:35 definitely
11:35 never we're definitely never uh over
11:39 burdened with methods of healing so
11:40 we'll take as many methods of healing
11:43 as we can what type of things are the
11:45 healing oh man everything headaches and
11:48 you know the pains in our stomachs and
11:50 because they don't know the anatomy of
11:51 the body
11:53 even if they cut it open it's just like
11:54 gobbly goop i mean can you imagine
11:56 cutting open a human body
11:57 or looking at the inside of a body 60
12:00 000 years ago and trying to figure out
12:02 what the hell is what
12:04 i mean we we would probably quite
12:07 frankly
12:08 have a similar experience
12:11 opening up a robot today an
12:14 android or something and thinking you
12:17 know
12:18 geez what are all these circuits if
12:19 you're not like electrical engineer
12:23 it's huge and so maybe you go on a
12:26 fact-finding mission
12:28 you want to see things work and
12:31 what will be the distinction will be
12:33 that your village has never seen this
12:34 stuff and their village has
12:38 if we go with that model and so when you
12:40 observe
12:41 things on the other side you may start
12:43 seeing
12:45 spiritual healing kind of stuff where
12:46 people actually react as if they are
12:48 healed whether or not they're not
12:49 whether or not they are healed
12:53 so then you're like god sure looks like
12:55 they think they're healed
12:57 and you would have to methodically
13:00 follow up
13:01 you have a broken bone because you fell
13:03 out fell out of that tree or the rock
13:05 roll over your leg or whatever happened
13:06 to you
13:07 and this witch doctor is saying he's
13:08 fixing you
13:10 all right can we we know what a broken
13:12 bone feels like it's slushy inside the
13:14 leg
13:15 there's something broken inside we can
13:17 feel it we may not completely understand
13:19 it but we feel it
13:21 so then you just kind of find out okay
13:25 something weird is going on here and
13:28 then of course you might have a very
13:30 gullible
13:31 society maybe
13:34 i mean hopefully you're not gullible
13:37 and you have to make decisions did we
13:40 let this go
13:42 the weird one is the placebo effect
13:43 which i just recently mentioned which is
13:45 sort of
13:45 like you can see an ebb and flow in my
13:47 mind as to
13:49 in a previous episode i kind of touch on
13:50 a subject and then
13:52 i'm going off after that episode and
13:53 continuing to kind of mulch the data
13:55 see if there's something there
13:59 when we are young we believe in magic we
14:01 simply do
14:03 even in modern day times this gentleman
14:06 mr randy
14:09 who i respect greatly my concern with
14:11 him
14:12 is that perhaps for him there is a
14:17 a sort of line in the sand in his mind
14:20 that
14:21 one group of individuals seems to have
14:22 produced more solutions for mankind
14:25 and another group is simply blowing
14:26 smoke up everyone's holes
14:29 in his mind he made it very clear in
14:31 this ted talk that he was really
14:32 concerned about the fact that
14:35 money is being extorted out of
14:36 individuals
14:38 that sylvia woman was getting paid seven
14:40 hundred dollars for a 20-minute phone
14:42 call
14:43 to tell you all kinds of stuff about
14:45 your relatives what you were before
14:47 and like i've joked several times in
14:49 episodes
14:51 every time i hear someone from just a
14:53 random
14:55 person tell me about reincarnation and
14:58 where
14:58 who they were before they were who they
15:00 are now you know we've got
15:02 so many women who think they were
15:03 nefertiti and so many dudes i think they
15:05 were julius caesar or caesar
15:07 or whatever it's like you can't all be
15:09 the same person
15:10 and you you he said you know it never
15:13 tells you about the 14 year old that
15:14 died in a ditch in london
15:15 due to the plague and those people never
15:17 come up
15:20 he gave an example that i think was
15:21 fairly brilliant because he said all
15:23 these people say they talk to
15:24 the dead and he goes something he goes
15:28 this one interesting person
15:30 [Music]
15:32 claims this and he goes you know i had a
15:34 grandmother
15:36 who died this is me talking for mr randy
15:39 and he goes she
15:40 left a will somewhere that we don't know
15:42 where it was
15:44 i don't know if it's a true story or not
15:45 but it's his example is brilliant he
15:47 goes we
15:48 wanted to know where the hell the will
15:49 was and he goes we were willing to pay
15:53 a lot of money if anyone could actually
15:55 talk to our grandmother and figure out
15:57 where she put it
15:59 and he goes they never say anything
16:00 specific they always say things about
16:04 one how they died
16:08 and the other one was uh that they are
16:10 loved from the other side
16:12 meaning your grandmother will tell you
16:14 she loves you from the other side
16:15 something obviously most of us would
16:17 want to hear
16:18 from a loved one john edwards who i've
16:21 talked about several times on the show
16:24 again i've had someone go to his
16:26 recording and said they sat there for 13
16:28 hours to extrapolate out a few hours
16:31 worth of broadcasting capability if
16:33 you've never seen this dude
16:34 i don't think he's on television anymore
16:37 i think he was pretty big on tv
16:39 while this ted talk was occurring he had
16:42 sort of a town hall
16:43 arrangement of bleachers in a circle and
16:45 he would sit in the middle
16:48 and mr rainey talked about the cold
16:51 reading techniques that he uses which is
16:53 to say
16:55 uh it doesn't make any sense to him that
16:58 a person from the other side would start
17:01 talking in weird indicators like i'm
17:04 getting a
17:05 letter j or the letter m anyone here
17:07 with a j or an m
17:08 which is a cold reading technique you
17:11 have no information about anyone so
17:13 you're trying to get them
17:14 tricked into giving you information he
17:17 did
17:18 obsess on as part of his formula
17:22 after he supposedly made it makes a
17:23 connection with someone who has passed
17:26 with someone in the audience it was odd
17:29 he did
17:29 talk about methods of death
17:33 now there are a few people that have
17:34 experienced john edwards
17:36 capabilities and they were convinced and
17:39 they were utterly skeptical about
17:41 him being real what's interesting is is
17:45 that there's warm reading techniques
17:46 where the individual will start to kind
17:48 of
17:50 tell you information about someone
17:53 like they might go to a palm reader and
17:55 say okay you know my father just died in
17:57 a car accident he was only
17:59 you know 55 years old or whatever and he
18:02 they'll volunteer a ton of information
18:04 to the
18:05 the psychic who then can take that
18:08 information
18:08 and reiterate it back disguised as new
18:11 information
18:12 and the person will go home reporting oh
18:15 my god
18:16 they told me things that only my father
18:19 would know
18:20 not realizing they actually volunteered
18:22 a tremendous level of indicators
18:24 to the person reading your poem now i do
18:28 have a similar episode to this one a
18:29 while back just in case you're
18:30 interested in this type
18:31 topic which is called horoscope
18:37 i think it's horoscope i don't think i
18:39 actually spilled horse but i spilled a
18:40 [ __ ]
18:41 like a prostitute and there was an
18:44 interesting
18:45 thing because we know about medical
18:47 perceived placebos right
18:49 if you believe you're healing yourself
18:51 you do
18:52 and the medical industry doesn't really
18:54 want to bubble up this
18:56 results table to you because we start
18:59 developing other placebo techniques and
19:01 the irony of the whole thing is that
19:03 if society were to become very aware of
19:06 placebo techniques then it probably
19:08 wouldn't work
19:09 because the full faith in that technique
19:11 would diminish so badly
19:13 that you would know you're taking a
19:14 sugar pill or whatever
19:17 one of the stories i heard i believe
19:20 from
19:20 mr randy was that he yeah it was from
19:22 him he said he had a friend who was a
19:24 professor
19:25 at harvard university who on the side
19:27 would read tarot cards to people
19:30 and he said that he was you know doing
19:33 several students
19:34 five days a week and so randy goes hey
19:37 so you really
19:38 believe in this oh yeah totally these
19:39 people tell me that i changed their
19:40 lives and all this other stuff
19:42 and so he goes okay do i want you to do
19:44 me a favor
19:46 and he says sure what and he says i want
19:48 you to read the opposite results of any
19:50 card that you draw meaning if the card
19:52 says life is going to be good
19:53 you tell them it's bad if they tell the
19:55 card says it's going to be bad you tell
19:56 them it's going to be great
19:57 and this dudes initially was like no way
19:59 man he goes this stuff works and i can't
20:01 possibly misdirect
20:02 my students and for whatever reason
20:06 he convinced his friend to do this
20:09 so for the next week he read everything
20:11 opposite feeling horrible losing his
20:13 sleep
20:14 but he kept to it the next week
20:18 when it rolled around all of his clients
20:22 slash probably friends said my god
20:25 your last week's reading was more
20:27 accurate than anything
20:30 that i've ever heard before anything
20:32 you've ever done before it's better
20:34 it's more accurate and according to mr
20:37 randy his friend
20:38 ceased reading cards for the rest of his
20:40 life because he proved to himself
20:42 it's all bogus you know the funny thing
20:45 you could do in a sort of a
20:47 black mirror episode script adjustment
20:49 to this would be that those cards are
20:51 actually demonic
20:52 and they're always misguiding you and by
20:54 him reading them backwards he actually
20:57 inverted the polarity of the satanic
20:59 ritual
21:00 over to a more positive godly ritual and
21:03 therefore these people truly did get a
21:04 much better
21:05 result just a funny little fictional
21:08 thing that comes to mind
21:10 what i am going to try to get us to
21:13 focus on in this particular episode
21:15 is the feeling of magic you can still
21:18 have it
21:19 trust me today you go see someone who
21:22 can do
21:23 coin work close-up coin work no sleeves
21:26 whatsoever
21:27 they will usually have a multi-layered
21:29 felt on the table
21:32 but some of these folks are so good they
21:34 can do it in thin air
21:35 right in front of your eyes i got a
21:37 close friend of mine who's a magician at
21:39 the magic castle
21:42 you know i've been friends for 17 years
21:44 he's amazing
21:46 he can pickpocket you he can do really
21:49 close-up tricks
21:51 but he will eventually reveal some of
21:53 them to me
21:54 i mentioned him several episodes ago
21:56 where he can roll
21:58 some money right in front of your face
22:00 man he'll get money from you like a
22:02 couple dollar bills or something and
22:03 he'll roll it into twenties or hundreds
22:05 right in front of you
22:06 and count it and like pull it out and
22:08 count it in front of you
22:11 it's obviously a trick
22:14 but for that moment for that micro
22:16 second that that you don't know how it's
22:18 done
22:19 or several seconds or minutes or even
22:21 days or you don't know how it's done
22:22 there's this weird magical thing that
22:24 that comes upon you as if the universe
22:26 itself
22:27 is turning into a fictional script that
22:30 you're watching on tv where this kind of
22:31 stuff happens in some lord of the rings
22:33 episode or something
22:35 when i had the experience which is
22:37 unrelated to this episode
22:40 where i was role playing in my 20s with
22:42 some professional role players
22:44 it's the best way i can describe it and
22:46 i was rolling the 20-sided die
22:48 to do this kill because the story had
22:50 hit a really rich point and
22:52 somebody had been killed and i wanted to
22:54 kill the person who killed her
22:56 and i was capable of doing it
22:57 fictionally in my role-playing character
23:00 this was straight up d and d
23:02 i did it and when i was rolling the die
23:04 that you know i explained in previous
23:06 previous episodes that i got this fear
23:08 around me
23:11 i've had this fear thing a few times and
23:13 it's
23:14 uh it shook out of me in an episode
23:16 that's coming
23:17 which is deja vu which will be out
23:19 before this episode
23:21 where when i was in this kitchen and i'm
23:22 predicting the future there's a sphere
23:24 around me
23:25 there's an old story i told many years
23:28 ago
23:29 where i wake up it's it's like summer
23:32 around noon
23:34 and uh i start walking down my hallway
23:39 i'm sleeping in a side room at the time
23:41 because my schedule my girlfriend was
23:44 very different and so i want to wake her
23:45 up
23:47 and i felt like i had another
23:50 consciousness
23:50 inside my consciousness talking to
23:54 itself
23:55 observing and it said to me
23:58 well it said to itself excuse me and
24:00 said to himself isn't it funny how these
24:02 these humans build homes so they can
24:05 feel safe in this world
24:07 and immediately inside my brain it
24:08 projected this little tiny earth
24:10 with a big giant shoebox home on top
24:13 really cute
24:14 and then i was like this is like the
24:16 weirdest morning of my life
24:18 it was a nice summer uh morning so it's
24:20 nice and warm i'm totally naked
24:22 pardon the visual i gotta walk down the
24:25 hallway take a turn go through the
24:26 master bedroom to go to the bathroom
24:28 to shower up and so i stopped at the in
24:30 the hallway there's two doors
24:32 or a few doors in front of me where i
24:33 keep like i keep electronics above
24:35 and some towels down below and finally i
24:39 stop and i go
24:42 something like you know i interrupt and
24:43 i go well who are you i'm doing it
24:45 inside my mind you know
24:47 and it all sudden notices me almost out
24:49 of embarrassment and it was a very kind
24:52 soul
24:53 and it was like oh you know like because
24:55 he was
24:57 talking about this you know this whole
24:59 funny that works kind of silly for
25:01 creating homes and i'm like you know
25:02 dude come down and be a human for a
25:03 little while and
25:05 sit down in the wintertime and this
25:06 mystery of why we create homes
25:08 is uh gonna fade really fast but i said
25:11 okay well then where are we
25:13 i mean you're thinking this is funny
25:15 where are we then give me an example
25:16 where
25:17 you wouldn't build a home and this
25:20 being of which had sort of a masculine
25:24 feeling gender to be honest
25:27 it goes oh let me show you it's all okay
25:30 it's okay like it felt like it had it
25:32 had intervened and broke the
25:34 the uh prime directive and it was trying
25:36 to clean up its mess
25:39 and so i'm standing in there at the end
25:40 of the hallway and i'm wide awake man
25:42 wide awake it's just a great day
25:46 the other little chow ski that i
25:47 mentioned was that i had no pain in my
25:49 body
25:50 like none and all i'll tell you is like
25:55 you don't realize you have pain in your
25:56 body until someone
25:58 takes it all away from you and then that
26:00 little bit of aches and pains started
26:02 being like oh well i guess i
26:03 i do live with a little bit of pain and
26:05 i don't even realize it right
26:07 you're shaking a little bit of the blood
26:08 around your body or whatever it is and
26:10 so this being said
26:12 let me show you and a sphere like a
26:14 glass sphere
26:16 shrunk from outside my view wreck down
26:19 to like about a basketball in front of
26:20 my face and it said
26:22 you're in here this is the entire
26:24 universe
26:25 you were always safe and it's just
26:29 it gave me this feeling of utter
26:31 euphoria like
26:32 just comforting euphoria not drugged out
26:36 euphoria but just like you're so
26:38 okay don't worry about it when i turn in
26:41 with the restroom and
26:42 you know i skipped brushing my teeth i
26:43 hopped in the shower and about
26:45 five minutes into the shower this being
26:46 was looking at my hands and
26:48 he was saying at one point he goes oh
26:50 man it's been a long time since i've
26:51 been a human being
26:52 or been in some human form and then it
26:54 just kind of faded away that was it
26:57 it's like i don't tell stories like this
27:00 uh
27:00 you know to get attention or anything
27:04 when i think back there was one
27:06 christmas man
27:08 and i probably mentioned once before but
27:09 there's a christmas where i got up i
27:11 think i must have been
27:13 five four or five and it was the
27:16 ideal norman rockwell painting
27:20 going on i got up went into the hallway
27:24 my parents had totally tricked out the
27:25 tree and they got me this
27:27 incredible like airport thing where it
27:31 was like this
27:33 i don't know if they got it from europe
27:35 it seems like they got it from europe
27:36 because we just moved
27:37 back from germany where i was born
27:41 yeah these beautiful little steel planes
27:43 and you would open up this sort of like
27:45 plastic
27:47 like boxy thing and it would
27:50 fall out flat and the airport was on
27:52 this inside of this thing
27:54 just beautiful man plus all the other
27:57 toys were kind of laid out for me and i
27:59 walked up to that tree and let me tell
28:01 you man
28:03 santa claus was real baby christmas was
28:06 a
28:07 true ritual of this dude coming out of
28:09 the north pole
28:10 and handing me some gifts because i had
28:12 been a good kid i guess didn't really
28:14 think about being a good kid or a bad
28:15 kid
28:17 and there was this just it was such a
28:19 profound moment of i guess concentrated
28:22 multi-dimensional magic
28:25 meaning there's santa claus magic
28:26 there's christmas magic there's toy
28:28 magic there's
28:29 there's christmas tree light magic and
28:33 i don't know if i had a spherical
28:36 impression in my mind most likely not
28:38 but it was definitely the sphere of
28:39 influence of what i'm looking at
28:42 my existence is a sphere in in multiple
28:45 methodologies and metrics right
28:49 there's the old saying which is that
28:52 your faith
28:54 if fully intact could move a mountain
28:58 and i'll talk to my friends who are
29:00 devout christians and
29:02 i can't tell them that i disbelieve that
29:05 because i actually do believe that
29:08 maybe the literal translation of moving
29:11 a mountain which would be very dangerous
29:13 for everybody involved is sort of
29:15 policed
29:16 somehow
29:19 but like i've said several times i got
29:22 friends
29:23 who could go up to a 40-story building
29:27 jump off the roof with nothing more than
29:30 an intersection down below in cars and
29:31 buildings in all the other corners
29:33 and somehow somehow they're going to
29:36 land on their feet
29:37 they're going to be okay they won't die
29:39 because they have a faith that they can
29:41 it's the most bizarre thing ever they're
29:44 very successful in business ventures at
29:46 least getting
29:47 jobs from other people full-time jobs
29:50 you know
29:52 they believe that what they need
29:53 probably in addition to what they want
29:55 will come to them and it always does
29:59 now what if you were a scientist who is
30:02 like
30:02 probably mr randy i think that guy
30:05 was just a very devout soul
30:09 to science and he he's old enough that
30:14 his science was probably good in the
30:16 past i mean overall
30:17 more genuine even if it's wrong more
30:20 genuine and less manipulated by
30:24 media or other factions now of course he
30:27 grew up in the einstein era so that i
30:28 think was a complete fraud
30:30 of all kinds of agendas
30:34 the more i think about the conspiracy of
30:36 einstein and
30:37 propping up this sort of peter sellers
30:39 guy to be brilliant was
30:41 accomplishing a tremendous amount of
30:44 objectives
30:47 some could be controlled as good but
30:50 most of it i think is more dangerous
30:51 than anything else because today
30:53 we're swimming in this guy's
30:55 close-mindedness
30:57 but now what if you weren't mr randy
31:02 and you are someone who is trying to
31:04 maintain your power and control over the
31:05 world
31:08 but because you have what is it the
31:11 vatican's 50 miles worth of
31:14 books in the basement that have been
31:18 hidden from the public perhaps you are
31:21 aware of
31:22 techniques that are likened to magic or
31:25 as good as magic you know alchemy
31:27 if it could work properly would be just
31:30 as intense as anything else i mean
31:34 and it's really not magic necessarily
31:37 it's unknown sciences
31:39 that can accomplish things that are
31:40 dreamy
31:42 one of our listeners shared with me
31:46 proof that her father was capable of
31:51 creating gold
31:53 very minut you know leafy kind of gold
31:56 out of
31:56 a piece of paper water and moonlight
32:00 she showed her to me okay i'm staring at
32:04 it exists and i trust her implicitly
32:07 she's not a tall tale kind of person in
32:09 any realm whatsoever
32:12 but think something's occurring i'm sure
32:14 there's a lot more going on than just
32:16 putting water and trying to get into the
32:17 moonlight because then everybody have
32:19 gold everywhere
32:20 every time it's a full moon so something
32:21 else was going on maybe
32:24 using some electromagnetic thing or
32:26 something don't know
32:28 it's science according to god
32:32 but according to man it might be magic
32:35 there was a great series that i think
32:37 finally released on
32:39 netflix which was a i forgot the name
32:42 completely some of you will remember it
32:44 and please
32:45 type it in the comments down below if
32:46 you remember the name but it was a
32:48 series about a
32:50 an era and i think kind of british
32:53 history it's all kind of
32:54 foe-ish you know it's kind of tim
32:56 burton-ish version of things
32:58 but it was a group of old farty men
33:01 who had their little masonic lodge sort
33:03 of thing
33:05 and they were i think the way that the
33:07 premise went was that their job was to
33:09 extinguish
33:10 any proof of magic
33:13 and the story's main character
33:16 is a character that i think was the
33:17 apprentice of a man of a magician
33:21 and he was trying to learn real magic
33:23 and of course it was being hidden
33:25 from the public because magic is
33:27 something that you wouldn't want people
33:28 to know you can do
33:29 because it'll turn into someone who's
33:31 going to be extorted like jesus christ
33:33 you know
33:34 if christ ever came down today and then
33:36 spent
33:37 30 years after telling everybody he's
33:39 christ and
33:40 people are suffering he's going to be
33:42 constantly in a carnival healing people
33:45 you know if he doesn't do like a
33:46 worldwide heal situation right
33:49 but there's that show carnival on hbo
33:53 where the kid had this capability
33:56 it was very tumultuous on his body he
33:58 had to take life from something else
34:01 so in the opening episode not to
34:04 ruin it for you but there's a little
34:06 girl who had braces on her legs
34:09 and she was probably polio or something
34:10 like that
34:12 and he sees her and he doesn't do
34:14 anything with her but he kind of
34:15 talks to her and then then later on he
34:19 has in a moment where he runs back to
34:21 this field where the slow girl kind of
34:23 plays in a wagon
34:24 she's got little you know braces on her
34:26 leg like forrest gump
34:29 and the carnival's leaving and he's not
34:30 sure he wants to go with the carnival
34:32 or stay and try to live out his life by
34:35 himself
34:36 and eventually kind of makes the
34:37 decision okay i'm gonna go with these
34:39 carnival they're driving away i mean
34:40 literally he's gotta run and hop in the
34:41 back of a truck while it's moving
34:45 so he looks at the little girl and he's
34:47 like okay i probably you know
34:49 the the subtext is i'm never going to
34:51 see you again so i'm going to heal you
34:54 and he just kind of looks a little grown
34:55 he says don't tell anybody i did this
34:56 and he puts his hands on her
34:58 legs and he leans down and
35:03 we the the director pulls back the
35:06 camera
35:07 and you start seeing all the soybeans i
35:08 think it was soybeans
35:10 turning brown in this radius away from
35:13 the girl
35:16 and then she stood up and ran and her
35:19 braces fell off
35:20 just like forrest gump and you know she
35:22 hasn't quite run in a while so she's
35:24 kind of stumbled a little bit and he
35:25 hauls but he's really tired
35:27 i think he gets a blood bloody nose sort
35:29 of like fire starter
35:31 he runs and hops in the back of the
35:33 truck and then we begin
35:35 the amazing two-season series called
35:38 carnival if
35:42 so the thing that got on netflix you
35:44 know this dude
35:46 collides with the masonic people trying
35:48 to keep magic
35:49 from being understood and you kind of
35:52 hear this backstory well there was a
35:54 time when magic was
35:55 understood and practiced but people got
35:57 out of hand really quickly
35:59 and so they work to snuff it out because
36:02 people can't be taught
36:03 super weapons and then be trusted with
36:05 them
36:07 so there's this constant thing that mr
36:10 randy talks about which is fairly
36:11 compelling when you first
36:13 hear it which is at the skeptic society
36:16 which i believe is headquarters is in
36:18 san francisco
36:20 they've offered a million dollars for
36:22 any type of supernatural anything
36:26 telekinetics esp fortune telling of any
36:29 kind talking to the dead anything
36:31 and no one's ever come to get the money
36:34 i should correct he actually explains
36:36 that many people have tried to come in
36:37 for the money and he goes
36:39 he goes the people that are willing to
36:40 come forward are always the biggest
36:42 rookies on planet earth and they're
36:44 caught very quickly
36:45 i mean why not try you're not going to
36:46 get put in jail hey if you can convince
36:49 him
36:49 then you get a million bucks but he said
36:51 all the professionals always steer away
36:52 from them
36:56 my personal take is that if you truly
36:58 had this capability
37:01 of any kind you would
37:04 potentially fear it and not use it much
37:09 or you would love it and realize
37:11 probably through
37:13 sort of a drunken implementation meaning
37:15 you're using it too much
37:17 you would run into some problems with
37:19 exposure
37:21 in carnival several episodes away from
37:25 the first episode the little girl
37:26 and her mother are walking through town
37:29 and the carnival had i guess looped back
37:32 near the region where this little girl
37:33 lived and she looks at the guy and she
37:35 says that's him mommy
37:36 he's the guy that fixed my legs and so
37:38 the woman runs up and starts yelling hey
37:40 you got to help me and
37:41 help other people and everyone else
37:43 hears about it and they all start
37:44 fawning over him and he's just like
37:46 he doesn't like people anyway and so he
37:48 you know gets in his truck and takes off
37:51 but the idea that someone with a true
37:53 intellectual power to create magic
37:55 situations which again is probably not
37:57 truly magic but something
37:59 the universe provides if you know what
38:02 you're doing
38:04 you wouldn't want the attention after a
38:06 few years of playing around with it in
38:08 my opinion
38:10 so that the fact that someone hasn't
38:12 come up and taken that million dollars
38:14 for me kind of makes sense
38:18 but if there were real magic how would
38:20 you discover it
38:21 and how would you deal with it what
38:24 would be your ecosystem of your life
38:28 i think that you would either
38:30 serendipitously bump into it
38:34 or you would more likely
38:38 be taught it by your family or someone
38:40 else who's potentially doesn't have any
38:42 family and they're like
38:43 okay come over here i'm going to show
38:44 you this right you know you would learn
38:45 something
38:46 some little tiny trick which would
38:49 fascinate the world for at least a
38:50 little while and there this day and age
38:52 you know
38:53 i mean the thing is is like take one of
38:55 these things that
38:57 at different times would blow you away
39:00 which would be something like
39:02 telekinesis you can move things with
39:03 your mind
39:05 but let's say you can't move a mountain
39:08 but you can move ball bearings or
39:10 or something of us limited size your
39:14 knowledge of this power
39:15 is like luke skywalker trying to pull
39:17 the x-wing out of the swamp at dagobah
39:20 his faith and his knowledge in the
39:21 technology that he has
39:23 the force isn't developed enough to be
39:25 able to be like yoda
39:27 who's one-third his size and you know
39:30 looks at this kid and goes all right
39:32 hold my beer
39:34 and he pulls the x-wing out of the swamp
39:38 it takes time but was yoda like five or
39:40 six hundred years old
39:42 and is expecting a child who is what
39:45 25 to have his 600 year knowledge just
39:48 because they did a few backflips in the
39:50 jungle so let's say the public found out
39:54 and the the dude or what girl takes the
39:57 money
39:57 it could be a child could be an adult
40:00 great it goes around the world and it's
40:02 sensational that the human mind
40:05 can be incubated up to a point where
40:07 this can occur
40:09 but now you have the limitation
40:11 potentially of the intellectual capacity
40:12 of the person with this talent
40:14 to share it with someone else in a way
40:16 that they can understand
40:18 how the system works such that they can
40:20 pass it around people can learn it
40:22 if that doesn't exist within the
40:24 individual who has maybe serendipitously
40:27 been born with this capability or been
40:29 taught this
40:31 capability then it would just fizzle
40:35 away we would know there's one oddity in
40:36 the world
40:37 one mutant with this capability what's
40:40 interesting about
40:42 you know being at live
40:45 is that you know our consciousness is
40:48 divided up into
40:50 different compartments at least
40:51 metaphorically so we can kind of have
40:53 discussions about it
40:56 as the helicopter flies over
41:00 i have found on my own body as this is
41:02 going to sound strange
41:03 so there's the autonomic system right
41:05 the one that takes care of our heartbeat
41:07 and our breathing and walking and all
41:08 that good stuff
41:10 you can become so enlightened and so
41:14 aware of your existence that you will
41:16 start to
41:17 interrupt your autonomic system not much
41:20 probably a fraction of a percent but you
41:22 can do it such that
41:23 things that are fairly automated within
41:25 your body become controlled
41:28 and i'll give you some low-hanging fruit
41:30 examples
41:32 that happen to a lot of us but we're not
41:34 realizing that what
41:35 that's what we're doing how many times
41:37 have you
41:38 been stressed and you get back pain or
41:40 you get a stomach ache or you get a
41:42 headache
41:43 and it's due to stress
41:46 and then someone comes up to you and and
41:48 solves the problem for you
41:50 hey guess what uh that thing doesn't
41:53 really uh
41:54 it got resolved it's awesome
41:57 oh gosh i feel so much better and all of
42:00 a sudden you feel like a million bucks
42:03 it's just an intellectual infection that
42:05 made you feel bad
42:07 physically and then an intellectual
42:10 resolve that made you let go
42:11 but the entire time you're feeling
42:13 physical ramifications of what you're
42:15 doing
42:17 if someone were to take that thing and
42:20 and flip it into some story being sort
42:24 of a fictional magic
42:26 they could probably 2000 years ago
42:28 convince you of a bunch of things that
42:31 aren't happening
42:32 or not happening for the reason that
42:33 they say
42:36 isn't it interesting that the older that
42:37 we get that magic feeling we had when we
42:39 were kids for whatever reason
42:41 whatever example you might have for me
42:43 christmas was probably one of the most
42:45 amazing moments
42:46 but someone's stealing your nose someone
42:48 pulling their thumb off their hand or
42:49 something like that
42:51 pulling a coin from behind your ears
42:54 you got a very interesting combination
42:57 of chemical
42:58 drops in the mind that made you feel
43:01 more than just a sensation in your body
43:05 it changed for a second your entire
43:07 perception of reality
43:08 the magic itself is possible
43:12 and when you think for a split second in
43:14 my opinion this anything is
43:15 is possible meaning magic
43:18 just simply being i will it therefore
43:20 occurs or i need to learn a
43:22 one two three step and this magical
43:24 thing
43:25 occurs then everything else in life
43:27 becomes possible too
43:29 any obstacle in your world becomes
43:31 possible
43:33 that's an amazing thing isn't it
43:37 as we get older we're constantly told
43:40 that
43:40 that by people like mr randy you mean
43:42 well that this stuff
43:44 isn't possible and that you were
43:45 mistaken and let me show you over and
43:48 over and over
43:49 why everything that you thought was
43:50 actually magical is not magical at all
43:53 some of it was blatant lies
43:58 again are we actually doing more good
44:01 than bad
44:03 have you ever had a dream where amazing
44:05 things were occurring and then you wake
44:07 up and for at least
44:08 30 seconds or so
44:11 you were doing something in your dream
44:13 that's not possible in this world
44:15 but when you woke up the dream
44:17 environment is still
44:18 kind of blending in with your reality
44:21 and for a split second or two or three
44:23 or whatever
44:25 you feel if you can just
44:29 grasp that in this world grasp the
44:32 elements that were controlled in your
44:33 dream
44:34 that you could bring that dream world
44:36 into this world
44:38 one of my favorite scenes in the matrix
44:41 the movie from 1999 was in keanu reeves
44:45 goes to visit the oracle
44:47 and he comes into the room and he
44:48 notices this kid
44:50 who looks like kind of a cancer
44:54 kid with all of his hair missing and
44:57 he's got a spoon
44:59 and he bends the spoon right in front of
45:01 neo
45:03 and what's beautiful about it is the way
45:04 that they directed keanu reeves and the
45:06 way he performed it
45:07 was that piano looks at the spoon and
45:09 the kid and because he's had so many
45:11 amazing things occur to him
45:13 in the last uh half hour or whatever
45:17 he's not being a jerk about it he's
45:19 looking at the kid going
45:21 you know how does this work how did you
45:23 just do that
45:25 would the kid tell him the kid told him
45:28 well you're not really trying to bend
45:30 the spoon
45:32 you're trying to bend reality with the
45:34 spoon in it
45:35 you know and so then neil looks at it
45:38 for a split second and
45:39 sure enough the spoon goes whoop and
45:40 then goes back to normal
45:43 that example for me is sort of a
45:47 an archetype of entry into a magical
45:50 frame of mind to say
45:52 you're just thinking about everything
45:53 wrong
45:55 when i first got to california within a
45:57 couple years i was renting a garage
45:59 from a family i've talked about this a
46:01 couple times a long time ago
46:04 but i don't know if i've ever given you
46:05 this story
46:07 we were a church group sort of i mean
46:10 the youth group i was one of the oldest
46:11 kids in the youth group and
46:13 so guys my age we come over to spend the
46:15 night
46:16 and there's like a little cot out there
46:18 and i had a sofa that turned into a bed
46:20 and so they would
46:20 sleep in the cot i'd sleep in the bed
46:23 and this garage had all kinds of cool
46:25 stuff in it man
46:26 in addition to my own guitars and
46:28 keyboards and all that kind of stuff we
46:30 had just
46:30 choskies from three kids that grew up in
46:32 this house
46:33 two of them were married and out of the
46:35 house one was just about to go to
46:36 college
46:38 and so we had like you know um fishing
46:42 fishing line that had pottery sculptures
46:45 on the end of it
46:46 you know the kids did it probably in
46:47 grade school or something
46:50 and i was playing with this theory at
46:53 the time
46:54 i think i'm about 19 20 years old
46:57 and i would concentrate on those
47:00 pieces hanging from a string thinking to
47:02 myself okay
47:05 the amount of energy it would take to
47:07 turn the porcelain
47:09 or sorry the pottery or whatever on the
47:11 end of a string must be
47:13 the most minute amount of energy that
47:16 anyone
47:16 would need to push on anything to get it
47:18 to move like a fly if a fly landed on
47:20 one of these things
47:21 you'd probably start spinning around a
47:23 lot because that's a lot of impact
47:25 so i thought wow this is actually a
47:27 really good technique i mean a really
47:28 good
47:29 methodology to test telekinesis
47:32 so i by myself
47:36 thought that i had
47:40 this working where i would concentrate
47:42 and push on
47:43 one side of it and get it to turn
47:45 clockwise and then i relax
47:47 let some time pass and then concentrate
47:50 on the other side make it go
47:51 counterclockwise
47:53 i'm not feeding you full of a bunch of
47:55 crap trust me man
47:57 when my buddies dave he was over and i
48:00 couldn't even see dave because he was
48:01 like so far away from me you know
48:03 but we i still had a light on the room
48:05 and i said dave you know can you see
48:07 that thing hanging up right there
48:10 and he goes yeah and he goes i said do
48:12 you see it moving right now
48:14 and he goes no i said okay so i
48:18 explained it to him
48:19 i explained what i've been doing very
48:20 open-minded dude
48:23 and he was kind of fascinated with me in
48:25 general because you know i was
48:26 very successful as a very young person
48:28 so i was kind of an oddity among the
48:30 kids right i was i'd already finished my
48:31 first stint with the turbo tax people
48:34 being one of the founding five people
48:37 like they already had the product
48:38 developed and i came in as the fifth
48:39 coder
48:40 and i was doing video games you know
48:42 artwork at that time which was this
48:43 crazy transition because i got laid off
48:46 and so you know it was like my
48:48 credibility was high
48:50 and i wasn't a tall tale person i never
48:53 did anything to get attention you know
48:54 it's just you know it was stable with
48:56 these dudes probably new guy for at
48:57 least a year
48:58 so i said okay here's the deal i'm going
49:01 to concentrate on this thing going
49:03 say counterclockwise let me know if
49:06 you see it move okay
49:10 now of course dave wants this to occur
49:12 and i want it to occur so that's sort of
49:14 the tense of the room
49:16 and i concentrated and the damn thing
49:18 started moving
49:20 and he was like oh my god
49:23 he goes he goes okay okay stop stop stop
49:27 stop and i'm like okay
49:28 and i didn't you know i guess i didn't
49:30 really have the belief that i could stop
49:32 it from moving like just grab it with my
49:34 mind and stop it so it definitely had to
49:35 slow down a little bit
49:37 so then i uh so you know of course he
49:39 wants me to make it go the other
49:41 direction
49:41 and i concentrated and it went the other
49:44 direction
49:46 it's not flying like a propeller or
49:47 anything it's very very slow
49:49 but he and i that night concluded
49:53 sort of like neo in this movie that you
49:55 could move a spoon
49:57 i mean you could concentrate on things
49:58 because in my mind
50:00 this was such a fragile state on this
50:03 piece of
50:05 pottery hanging on a fishing line i had
50:09 a belief that if this was capable that
50:12 this would occur
50:14 and shamefully i have never tried to do
50:16 this since
50:18 so i don't know it definitely happened
50:22 you could interview him on a lie
50:23 detector test interview me on a lie
50:24 detector test and we're going to pass
50:26 the test if he remembers the moment
50:28 i should actually ask him we're still
50:30 friends on facebook
50:32 so my reason for sort of mentioning that
50:35 is to say okay
50:36 that wouldn't have been magic that would
50:39 have been science
50:40 that would have been my mind projecting
50:42 some ether
50:43 wind i suspect you know at the object
50:46 controlling it with my mind in such an
50:48 infinitesimal way
50:50 and hitting such a delicate object
50:53 hanging
50:54 that this was going to actually work
50:57 okay i did a whole episode on
51:00 spontaneous combustion if you guys are
51:02 interested
51:03 and you haven't seen it there are some
51:06 definitely unexplained situations with
51:08 spontaneous combustion others have
51:10 explanations
51:13 but the methodology of how these bodies
51:15 burned
51:17 are very suspect and it sort of seems
51:21 you know like when you see something
51:23 like that these photographs of these
51:25 these legs that are the only thing left
51:28 sometimes you know
51:30 people burned up in their beds
51:33 people burned up just walking across
51:35 their rooms
51:37 so i mean you're not you're not going to
51:38 have a cigarette burn
51:41 situation where someone falls asleep in
51:43 a chair when a woman is just crossing
51:45 your living room
51:45 that ends up burning up so we look at
51:49 that and our brain
51:50 just like when you know the definition
51:51 of laughter is when two conflicting
51:53 ideas
51:54 enter the mind we can't resolve an
51:56 emotion
51:57 for that information and so we laugh but
52:00 what about these situations like
52:02 spontaneous combustion you're looking at
52:03 something you can't explain
52:05 but the person is dead
52:08 burned and you have to watch the episode
52:12 to get all the details about
52:14 the forensic science around the burning
52:16 techniques meaning
52:18 you know a body burning all the way down
52:21 to the point where bones are not visible
52:24 above the kneecaps and then you ask
52:26 someone who runs a crematory
52:28 what it would take to burn a body so
52:30 there's no bone dust
52:33 an average crematory today in the modern
52:36 21st century takes three and a half
52:38 hours per body and you will be given
52:40 tons of bone matter
52:42 a friend of mine had his mother cremated
52:45 and he said you know
52:46 the most disturbing thing was to see the
52:48 bones when he poured it over a
52:51 bridge which is where she wanted to have
52:53 happen
52:55 uh in addition this gentleman has
52:56 absolutely no
52:58 conspiratorial mind very solid state
53:01 kind of guy
53:02 no telltales of any kind that he's ever
53:04 told me very accomplished hollywood guy
53:07 and he said that when he tossed his
53:08 mother's ashes over this
53:10 bridge in i think colorado i think
53:14 his wife was standing behind him and she
53:17 is also very
53:18 very left brain genius
53:22 he said he swore that these ashes turned
53:24 into an angel
53:26 that looked very much like his mother
53:28 and before it floated away
53:31 he said it was so blatant and so defined
53:34 this guy is an artist
53:35 physical artist uh he's a director
53:38 he he's a legendary dude legendary dude
53:43 he said he turned to his wife and said
53:44 did you just see that
53:46 and she goes you mean the angel
53:49 that just came out of those ashes not
53:52 quite as good as john goodman
53:54 dumping out donny's ashes in the big
53:57 lebowski
53:59 why is everything with you a [ __ ]
54:00 catastrophe man
54:02 what was that stuff about vietnam one of
54:05 the best movies ever
54:07 but if you were to take the fact that we
54:09 are again this is a repetition
54:11 of the other episode that i made
54:16 we are more open-minded as young people
54:18 with the deja vu episode
54:20 we're more open-minded as young people
54:22 because we haven't been clobbered to
54:23 death by society
54:26 to conform to survive and then to
54:27 conform to be accepted
54:30 well if you only have james randy as an
54:34 uncle
54:35 this dude is going to be putting
54:36 padlocks on your mind
54:38 oh he'll show you tons of magic tricks
54:40 and he'll be an endearing wonderful
54:43 uncle or whatever i think he was gay so
54:47 i don't think he's going to be your dad
54:48 but
54:49 it's going to be great but then
54:53 your capability like like your sacrifice
54:55 for accepting this information
54:57 is to have no magic in your life ever
55:01 even if you were to see something after
55:03 being his
55:04 relative or something for say 20 30 40
55:07 years and you go to the magic castle and
55:08 you see things
55:10 you can't enjoy it as much because
55:11 you're always looking for how it was
55:13 done
55:14 in a cynical way is that a crime in
55:17 itself
55:19 that's my big question and i'm going to
55:22 loop back on something
55:24 that kind of applies to this which is
55:28 you know we hear about and i mention it
55:30 all the time because and i try to go at
55:32 it from different angles and this is
55:33 going to be a slightly different angle
55:35 on the same example bill burr has a as a
55:39 really funny
55:40 bit about steve jobs being the inventor
55:43 and in his bit he minimizes steve jobs
55:46 invention
55:47 capabilities by saying that steve just
55:50 comes up with these
55:51 crazy ideas that are perceived
55:52 impossible
55:54 and then his scientists who work for him
55:56 are really the true geniuses and that
55:58 steve is stealing all the geniuses ideas
56:02 and you know that's if you're close to
56:05 steve
56:06 you know and you studied his life and
56:08 you saw the magic that this guy pulled
56:10 off and you really know what he was
56:11 responsible for refining he really did
56:13 participate
56:14 at times and the refinement and styling
56:16 of an object so that you would accept it
56:19 because there's a lot of great
56:20 inventions out there made by people
56:22 don't know how to make a user interface
56:23 or something like that
56:26 well the features just suck the way
56:28 they're put together right so this guy
56:29 was a legit
56:30 contributor but bill burrs has a point
56:33 there
56:33 are definitely geniuses behind this dude
56:35 that make the magic happen
56:37 however the reality distortion field
56:40 that steve is always known for
56:42 is usually a criticism of steve that he
56:44 was just
56:46 full of it all the time and somehow
56:48 being full of it always seemed to yield
56:50 the product that makes
56:52 trillions of dollars apple has made
56:55 over a trillion dollars and
56:58 in large part due to steve wozniak's
57:01 original brain trust
57:03 and then steve jobs ability to polish
57:06 and market
57:07 without those two men you don't have
57:09 apple now
57:11 functionally speaking steve provided for
57:14 his people
57:15 the financial capability to mull over
57:19 inventions and so there's a functional
57:21 aspect to his reality distortion field
57:23 i will pay you a salary i'll put a roof
57:25 over your head
57:26 i'll give you benefits whatever but then
57:29 there's this reality distortion field
57:31 which
57:32 in my mind because i don't know
57:35 how steve ever felt about his existence
57:37 and there's many steves in the world
57:39 there's women who are steves right
57:41 but what if this bubble because this is
57:44 sort of how it's
57:45 portrayed in the critique
57:48 what if this bubble this reality
57:50 distortion field is much much more
57:53 than just this criticism of him
57:58 but if within his world he believes in
58:01 sort of
58:02 magic which obviously at its core
58:05 is not magic it's simply belief that
58:08 something can be accomplished
58:12 so you get within this guy's sphere of
58:14 influence
58:16 and suddenly you're capable of doing
58:17 something that you weren't capable of
58:19 doing by yourself
58:21 partially maybe because he's guiding you
58:23 and giving you
58:24 a how-to even though he doesn't know how
58:26 to do the individual steps
58:28 he still comes up magically with steps
58:30 that actually are pretty logical and
58:31 connect together
58:32 you're going to come up with extra steps
58:34 as the person who implements it
58:36 that he doesn't know about you know that
58:38 one step you had yesterday
58:40 uh yeah okay well that was actually ten
58:41 steps okay great you got it done
58:43 that's all i care about next but what if
58:47 that feeling that we have at christmas
58:48 time
58:50 when we're little or substitute for
58:52 something else that's magical when you
58:54 were young
58:55 is sort of the actual constant state of
58:57 existence of someone like steve jobs
59:00 and because you're in his proximity you
59:03 get infected by his
59:05 belief system and suddenly you can do
59:08 things you didn't think you could do
59:11 i definitely have pushed my employees at
59:14 times
59:15 in those realms and seen them do things
59:17 they didn't think they were capable of
59:18 doing
59:20 just telling a human being for instance
59:22 when they tell you and report to you
59:24 that there's a
59:25 problem that they don't think they can
59:27 solve
59:28 yeah i'm very technical so i was able to
59:31 always kind of look inside and go well
59:32 maybe we can do this maybe
59:34 look in there and see if there's
59:35 something we can do there and what'll
59:37 end up happening is
59:38 sometimes i would say probably less than
59:40 50 percent
59:41 my suggestion is turns out to be
59:44 a path to solution but probably more
59:47 than 50 percent of the time the employee
59:50 who i told emphatically to their face i
59:52 believe you can get this done
59:53 i know you're the person to get this
59:55 done they go home
59:57 with someone they respect believing in
59:59 them and all of a sudden they find the
60:01 solution has nothing to do
60:04 with my suggestion but my faith in them
60:07 bled into them and became a mantra for
60:09 them
60:10 where there's probably a couple
60:12 different factors one
60:14 someone believes in them and depending
60:15 on what kind of parental system they
60:17 have set up or friend system maybe they
60:19 don't have anyone in their life that's
60:20 ever said anything genuine to them like
60:22 that
60:22 and sometimes your parents say it so
60:24 much it's sort of like bowls away like
60:26 the
60:27 example we had with smell that
60:30 deteriorates over time if you continue
60:32 smelling the same thing
60:33 so maybe your parents aren't a good
60:34 example as well there's
60:37 sort of a pleasing your mentor
60:40 situation a mentor may be a strong word
60:42 for some examples
60:44 but you go home and you go man i don't
60:45 want to let him down
60:47 and so you work extra hard and you just
60:49 believe in your heart
60:51 illogically perhaps and court and
60:55 james randy's frame of mind
60:58 that you shouldn't believe in yourself
61:00 because of some superstition
61:02 you should just believe in yourself
61:03 because you mechanically are smart and
61:05 blah blah blah blah
61:06 well one is fun to think and the other
61:08 one's not fun to think
61:11 you want to think that you're special
61:13 and i guarantee you you are
61:15 and whatever you do there have been so
61:18 many clients of mine
61:20 that have been celebrities that in some
61:23 cases
61:24 i would meet uh well i would tell you
61:26 i'll just give you some examples and
61:28 this could be a little name droppy but i
61:30 apologize but it will just give you
61:31 sort of the difference between multiple
61:34 people
61:36 and my my ability to
61:40 create and polish in relation to my
61:42 respect for them
61:44 the very first celebrity i ever worked
61:46 for was the lead singer of
61:48 in vogue back in the 90s she had come up
61:50 with a perfume
61:52 and she needed her website to feature
61:54 that in a very beautiful elegant way she
61:57 was extremely beautiful woman
61:59 and i was invited to her house in
62:01 oakland california she sent me home with
62:03 probably three
62:04 huge photo albums of her whole life
62:07 i mean personal stuff and everything and
62:10 so she want to have a gallery and that
62:12 kind of stuff and so
62:13 my attitude when i went home was to say
62:16 okay
62:16 one this is a monumental opportunity for
62:20 me to transition out of
62:22 corporate clients into celebrity clients
62:24 and so i went home taking that extremely
62:26 serious
62:27 but two she was such a sweetheart
62:30 such a wonderful person that i wanted to
62:33 say okay
62:35 my buddy put his reputation on the line
62:39 to introduce me to her and so i
62:42 i wanted to preserve his reputation but
62:44 at the same time
62:46 i wanted to blow this woman away i
62:47 wanted her to see something that
62:49 that represented the elegant nature of
62:51 her being and she had this
62:52 beautiful photo shoot she did with these
62:54 perfume
62:56 bottles and spraying her leg and dress
62:58 she's dressed in a beautiful dress and
63:00 so
63:00 i was able to create a website that
63:04 really looked and felt like her felt
63:06 like the scent
63:07 she was very satisfied great
63:11 but then i ran into well i pursued and
63:15 ran into folks like sid mead
63:18 and sid is like the designer of
63:19 designers right he's the guy that
63:21 you know if you're an amazing designer
63:23 you say who's better than you and they
63:24 would say sid
63:25 said me so when i got the chance to help
63:29 him
63:30 do all kinds of stuff oh you know
63:32 website stuff
63:33 these animations creating pieces artwork
63:36 with his artwork
63:38 i wanted to make one of my childhood
63:40 heroes
63:41 feel like i had learned something from
63:44 his guidance
63:45 you know of course drawing from
63:46 influences outside of him
63:49 so that drove me to polish polish polish
63:53 i got to a point where this is going to
63:55 sound silly because websites today are
63:57 nothing they're all wordpress or some
63:59 other
64:01 templated thing but i was it was back in
64:02 the day when you had to be
64:04 what's called a web master you were the
64:06 uh the artist and the programmer all at
64:08 the same time you had to be an expert in
64:09 both
64:10 and i mean expert you know and so i did
64:13 a version of his site based off a book
64:15 that he had just written and was just uh
64:17 publishing which is mainly artwork of
64:21 course
64:21 and his narration of the various pieces
64:23 and i was at art center with him as he
64:25 was dedicating a piece of art
64:27 donating it to the college and this dude
64:29 ran around the crowd and said um
64:33 he introduced me across the room like i
64:36 wasn't there and so he told you know i
64:38 got my
64:38 dude here does my website and this this
64:41 teacher
64:42 at art center and art center is like
64:44 probably one of the top art schools on
64:46 the planet
64:46 at least it was i don't think about it
64:49 today this is where most the car
64:50 designers come from and this dude
64:52 demanded an introduction
64:55 so i'm just standing there looking
64:57 around you know and here comes said with
64:59 this dude
65:00 and this guy's like shaking my hand and
65:02 he's like man he goes
65:04 the scythe you created was different
65:06 than every other site i've ever seen
65:08 and he goes man you use negative space
65:10 for the first time in web design that
65:11 i've ever seen
65:12 it just was mystified and i'm looking at
65:15 this whole situation going man
65:17 you know i'm super honored that you feel
65:18 that way and i'm looking at sid kind of
65:20 been back in my brain going
65:22 well that only happened because i was
65:23 working for sid i felt that
65:25 i felt compelled to copy sort of the
65:29 arrangement techniques that said jesus
65:31 in his paintings in the website
65:34 one of those situations last example
65:37 um well i'll give you kind of a dual
65:39 last example
65:41 i worked for and made really good
65:43 friends with robert llewellyn from
65:45 the uk who was crichton on red dwarf
65:48 i just love the guy i just think his the
65:51 show is fantastic red dwarf
65:53 and i kept pestering the guy and finally
65:55 through a fairly funny chain of events
65:58 i kept asking him look i'm trying to
66:00 build up a portfolio i'm already making
66:02 tons of money i work at ea i don't need
66:04 that's not my job i'm just doing this
66:05 because i love you
66:07 he finally said you know i put a lot of
66:09 money into a new company and i don't
66:10 have a lot of money left over for you
66:12 and i said it's not a money thing dude
66:14 i'll do it for free
66:15 he really felt morally obligated to
66:18 compensate me in some way and eventually
66:20 that started but i sent him a copy of
66:23 what it would look like
66:24 and you better believe i'm sitting there
66:27 trying to create the very best thing i
66:29 could possibly create for that dude
66:32 and then the same thing happened with
66:33 ella cool j same thing
66:35 just push push push
66:38 so i know that seems a little bit off
66:41 topic but the idea is
66:43 if anyone walked up to you and said
66:46 i got someone that understands magic
66:50 would you like to meet them wouldn't you
66:53 go for it
66:54 no matter what category of magic it is
66:56 alchemy
66:57 or whatever what seems like magic to the
67:01 layman
67:02 people and we you know there's a bunch
67:05 of beautiful definitions of magic which
67:06 is essentially
67:07 that is that of which is perceived
67:09 impossible that is accomplished always
67:11 seems like magic
67:13 you know future generations will always
67:14 look like magicians to previous
67:16 generations etc etc
67:18 as secret societies gobble up
67:21 accomplishments we lose techniques they
67:24 hide techniques they destroy techniques
67:26 and we look at pre-dynastic
67:28 egypt and and pre-inca
67:31 construction in south america and
67:32 magic's everywhere today
67:34 how do they build the pyramids you know
67:36 how they build all those other
67:38 structures south of the pyramids i mean
67:39 it's just we have magic around
67:42 us constantly what i want to offer you
67:45 in this episode is to re-explore your
67:48 own perception of magic
67:50 and perhaps a more technical container a
67:53 more clinical container
67:56 so that you may find a little trick that
67:57 you have up your sleeve
68:00 that you've had for years perhaps you
68:02 forgot about it
68:04 perhaps it was a moment in your business
68:06 life or your personal life where things
68:07 went really really well because your
68:09 perception bubble
68:10 was that of steve jobs you were
68:13 invincible
68:14 at a younger age perhaps perhaps it was
68:16 a product of your youth
68:19 perhaps it was a product of not being
68:21 told that you can't
68:24 and so as i always tell you guys you
68:27 have to
68:27 have a some sort of frequency of a
68:31 ritual
68:32 of throwing everything out of your mind
68:33 that you think you believe so much from
68:35 religion
68:36 have the have the guts to do it man to
68:39 science to whatever it is
68:41 and and there's a lot of folks that do
68:42 this who are flat earthers right and
68:44 they get ridiculed constantly
68:47 but you throw it all out and it's like a
68:48 hoarding show put everything on the
68:50 front lawn
68:50 you're gonna make three piles because
68:53 you don't have to get rid of anything
68:54 this is not a hoarding thing we have to
68:55 get rid of anything
68:57 but you're gonna reevaluate is it in the
68:58 truth pile the false pile or the maybe
69:01 pile
69:02 most cases the navy pile is an order of
69:05 magnitude over the other two piles
69:08 perhaps in that ritual with the
69:11 with the pretense that you're gonna go
69:13 find things that you used to believe
69:15 and test them again you can find some
69:18 magic
69:19 for yourself that will yield benefits
69:25 benefits you forgot about
69:28 one of the sort of esoteric examples i
69:31 can give you
69:33 then i'll close off is the scene with
69:36 richard dreyfuss in
69:37 close encounters of the third kind
69:40 obviously because of some episodes i've
69:41 been making here this movie's just
69:43 always reintroduced into my mind but
69:46 there's a scene where
69:47 well there's multiple scenes after he
69:48 sees the ufo fly over his head
69:50 with other people there especially the
69:52 woman with her little kid
69:55 he starts to see something
69:58 and he's eating his mashed potatoes and
70:00 he's carving them into kind of a
70:02 mountain
70:04 he's looking at his kids they're crying
70:06 they all think dad's gone nuts
70:08 and then his he's got a train set for
70:10 his child and he starts playing with the
70:12 clay in the center of the
70:13 train set he starts kind of using a fork
70:16 and
70:17 pulling it down and and then finally he
70:19 realizes i got to stop this i'm losing
70:21 my marriage i'm freaking out my kids
70:23 and so he grabs the clay at the top
70:26 and pulls really hard to get it off the
70:28 you know the train set and he manages to
70:30 pull off a clean
70:31 cut top off the mountain
70:34 which then reveals devil's tower
70:38 where the aliens have sent their message
70:40 to meet the government of the united
70:42 states of america
70:43 for the first encounter dropping off
70:45 flight 19 people from bermuda triangle
70:49 among others
70:52 eventually at that moment
70:55 realizes that's the shape
70:59 and he then builds a gigantic one in his
71:01 living room
71:02 loses his wife loses his kids i mean he
71:05 really did
71:06 that was the last time he'll ever see
71:08 them again in his entire lifetime
71:11 because he leaves the example for me
71:15 in that little film clip is his faith
71:19 and his perseverance and something that
71:21 was haunting his mind
71:23 that he couldn't and of course later he
71:26 found out the woman was drawing them
71:28 in charcoal drawings hundreds of them
71:31 she had a down pat she was there quicker
71:33 than he was
71:34 which is why they joined up to
71:38 figure out what's going on i think it
71:41 might be a really fun
71:42 exercise in the comment section to
71:46 have you share anything that happened to
71:48 you in your lifetime
71:50 that one may felt may have been
71:53 unequivocal magic because you were young
71:56 and then something that happened to you
71:59 after you think you crossed the
72:02 threshold of being an adult
72:05 and see if we don't have similar
72:06 experiences
72:09 and you might even share examples of
72:11 friends that you have
72:12 let's say you never had it happen but
72:14 you know friends that have had it happen
72:17 let's compare notes man deep thoughts
72:20 university we gotta
72:21 get together and share everything that
72:22 we know to know where we're going
72:24 where are the holes in our research
72:28 might be kind of cool right
72:32 anyway hopefully this was just
72:33 stimulating to you this kind of stuff
72:35 just
72:36 totally fascinates me man and i just
72:38 think that
72:40 what i'm doing in these more esoteric
72:42 episodes is sort of sharing with you
72:44 in a live stream although slightly
72:46 delayed for editing reasons
72:48 believe me you're very glad i edit these
72:51 my stream of consciousness as it happens
72:53 to me throughout a particular
72:55 season and what i have found is
72:58 man some of the replies are so amazing
73:03 and actually some of these episodes that
73:05 are more esoteric do better than the
73:06 ones that i think will be more
73:07 commercial
73:08 it's very interesting man so anyway if
73:11 you haven't been to
73:12 deepthoughtsradio.com please go and
73:13 bookmark the whole thing
73:15 everything you want is there so there's
73:17 the bumper on that one
73:19 we are being censored by youtube
73:22 so if youtube still exists for our
73:25 channel at the time you hear this which
73:26 it may very well not be
73:28 they are knocking down the users at a
73:30 blatant
73:31 embarrassing level of intervention
73:36 they're knocking down five at a time
73:39 we had a five today and then we had an
73:41 eight today
73:43 we are now again eclipsing yearly view
73:46 counts in terms of hours viewed at a
73:49 record-breaking pace so the channel's
73:51 getting watched more than it's ever been
73:53 watched in the past
73:54 and we're losing subscribers it's just
73:56 interesting
73:58 so make sure you're subscribed if you
74:01 think anyone will be interested in this
74:02 sort of thing definitely do it
74:04 what's interesting for me is that my
74:05 personal life when i meet individuals
74:07 and
74:07 i'm let's say i'm sitting i just had it
74:10 tonight i'm sitting with someone who
74:14 knows the channel exists seen it loves
74:16 it
74:17 and then there were other people talking
74:20 to me
74:20 and this buddy of mine goes hey man he's
74:22 got a channel you got to watch you know
74:23 i don't sit around advertising it
74:24 necessarily but
74:26 and then as soon as it comes out there's
74:28 a bunch of new subscribers
74:30 and so i know that you know over a
74:31 particular night i might gain three to
74:33 five subscribers just because i went to
74:34 a little gathering of some sort
74:36 so if you can pass it around we're
74:38 conducting an experiment i'm not trying
74:40 to pimp the channel
74:42 i really believe in organic situations
74:44 but our organic situation is actually
74:46 being
74:47 impaired by youtube directly
74:50 and it's not a human being doing it it's
74:52 definitely an algorithm doing it
74:54 but they're getting very aggressive with
74:55 destroying content
74:57 that obviously is true
75:00 because they're not penalizing us for
75:03 saying anything negative
75:04 necessarily like i don't get the emails
75:06 contesting what i'm saying
75:08 but we're obviously embedding all kinds
75:11 of interesting things into the
75:12 uh episodes i don't think they really
75:14 care about these kind of episodes but
75:15 the other ones
75:16 i think they have problems with so it's
75:17 like you'll let it kill a channel
75:19 but bid shoot is a place you gotta go
75:21 and make a channel or sorry make an
75:23 account
75:24 and then subscribe to the channel just
75:25 look up deep thoughts
75:28 because that is just growing and growing
75:30 and growing there's no problem we don't
75:31 get any
75:32 major reductions there one or two will
75:34 lever once well that's cool
75:36 absolutely respect that 100 but
75:38 youtube's playing games
75:40 so help us fight the youtube
75:43 battle i would almost rather have them
75:45 cancel the youtube channel because
75:47 they're douche bags
75:48 and they're violating their what is it
75:50 230
75:52 immunity clause than to sit there and
75:55 have them chew down everybody that's
75:56 been on the channel and just watch a
75:58 demise
75:59 you know so that's my opinion anyway
76:02 anyway until next time take care of
76:04 yourself and someone else and i'll see
76:05 you on the next deep thoughts
76:06 over now
76:21 [Music]
76:33 [Applause]
76:39 [Music]
76:44 you
