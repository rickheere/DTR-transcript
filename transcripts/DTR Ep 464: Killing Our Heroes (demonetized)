00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen today is a request and what's
00:36 interesting is a couple of you have
00:38 requested it in last month or so so this
00:42 is for you
00:43 now the request came in to really focus
00:47 on JFK and I am going to use a book that
00:54 I own which I cannot find in my house I
00:56 don't know where the hell it went I
00:58 loaned it to a friend he gave it back to
01:00 me then he rented a room for a little
01:02 while and then he left and I know he
01:04 didn't take it with him so I don't know
01:06 where the hell the book is but the book
01:08 is a brilliant mind-blowing factual
01:16 documentary I would say of this subject
01:20 matter and the book is called the serial
01:22 killers of Lincoln JFK RFK and MLK they
01:28 don't talk about Malcolm X but we're
01:30 gonna throw them in there as well but
01:32 I'm calling this killing our heroes so
01:39 there's there's one fascination of who
01:42 killed these people on any one
01:44 particular day who did the shooting who
01:47 did this I'm gonna tell you we'll talk
01:51 about John Wilkes Booth we'll talk about
01:55 [Music]
01:56 Lee Harvey Oswald Sirhan Sirhan and look
02:01 up the guy's name James Earl Ray who's
02:04 blamed for killing MLK no one was
02:08 specifically identified with the death
02:10 of Malcolm X but in this book which I
02:14 recommend everyone get a copy of because
02:16 it will be you know contraband if they
02:20 ever get control it will give you the
02:23 most exhaustive detail about how they
02:26 carried out Lincoln's death including
02:28 newspapers that were printed in Europe
02:30 that were freaking out with his printing
02:33 of the greenback
02:34 a bunch of personal letters that were
02:36 written between men talking about how
02:39 they could get the John Wilkes Booth out
02:43 of the country and then put up in this
02:45 island off the coast of England it gives
02:49 you an exhaustive background detail of
02:51 all the gunmen that were hired to kill
02:53 JFK specifically and I'm gonna throw in
02:56 some other things that I have heard over
02:58 the years we're gonna talk about MKULTRA
03:02 sirhan sirhan
03:03 I believe is still life James Earl Ray
03:09 is now I think dead
03:11 it was falsely accused of killing
03:13 killing killing MLK and the interesting
03:16 thing about that is his family figured
03:17 it out and said you know what let this
03:19 guy go he didn't kill our Father we're
03:22 aware of the bigger game here now there
03:25 are plenty of other people that have
03:27 been assassinated in this world there's
03:29 been attempts on you know president
03:30 Jackson's life because he was up against
03:33 the bankers and a guy pulled out a
03:34 derringer two different occasions and
03:36 tried to shoot him the derringers failed
03:42 it was two times there I know that the
03:44 funeral was buddy this guy showed up in
03:46 it's pouring rain and he tries to shoot
03:48 a you know a flint derringer and of
03:50 course it didn't work because it was wet
03:52 and then he had another one in his
03:53 pocket and he pulled it out and try to
03:55 do it again didn't work and then the
03:57 story goes Jackson took out his gloves
03:58 and smacked him in the face I mean wow
04:02 but reserve that man had before we go
04:07 into any details whatsoever I think it's
04:12 important to pull back from the
04:13 specifics of who did it and how they did
04:15 it and remember that these are events
04:19 that are orchestrated at the tippy top
04:21 of the pyramid to get rid of individuals
04:25 that would interfere with a flow of
04:28 control and perhaps and the control is I
04:34 should say this it's not perhaps and the
04:37 control is actually a stream of various
04:41 mechanisms now you all know this but I
04:45 want you to piece it together in your
04:46 brain so that you ascend
04:48 of these old events that you can't
04:50 change by going back in time in your
04:54 mind and get to what could happen today
04:58 because we have right now in the United
05:00 States of America a guy they want dead
05:03 and they've shown you several times that
05:06 they want him dead they there now
05:08 orchestrating this narrative that it's
05:11 okay from the left to assassinate the
05:14 president to discuss and reenact and
05:18 enact killing the president you know
05:21 Kathy Griffin that piece-of-shit man she
05:24 does this mock cutting off the head of
05:27 the president not just that it wasn't
05:28 goofy they covered it in blood and what
05:32 could this woman have thought she was
05:33 doing it just shows you the super low IQ
05:36 of what's going on and what won't you do
05:39 for money it wasn't funny his 11 year
05:43 old son at the time saw on TV
05:45 it was horrified thought it actually
05:47 occurred I mean you know you're 11 and
05:50 if you're not doctrine ated like the 11
05:53 year olds of today to watch you know
05:55 Walking Dead and all these other you
05:57 know gory movies this might be the very
05:59 first time you see anything that
06:01 repulsive that horrific in your life and
06:04 it's your father's head and even though
06:08 it wasn't identical it was pretty damn
06:12 close I mean just just take away on that
06:19 particular vent I just want to dwell on
06:21 that for one second take away the fact
06:23 that it was a president and just try to
06:26 replace it with anyone even if it was
06:28 Jeffrey Epstein's head and we had all
06:30 this news about him actually revealed of
06:33 all the things that he did to small
06:35 girls up we'd all feel like that's maybe
06:38 what he deserves but you wouldn't show
06:40 on national television or some you know
06:43 some soapy rag like tmz.com for a laugh
06:46 maybe it's embedded in a movie maybe
06:49 it's embedded in a specific mature
06:50 television show but it's not out there
06:52 for the press to see and take a picture
06:55 of and distribute all over the world it
06:58 was disrespectful to our president
07:01 and it's I mean imagine doing that in
07:03 England imagine what would have happened
07:05 to any citizen in England had they held
07:07 up a mock face head of the Queen of
07:13 England covered in blood
07:15 you know asleep as if it had its head
07:18 chopped off of an acting queen they
07:22 would have rolled a Scotland Yard would
07:24 have rolled in that person's house and
07:25 if they survived the arresting situation
07:28 they would have spent their life in
07:29 prison forever and our presidents goes
07:33 what over ok mr. Trump when they try to
07:38 kill you you've let all this [ __ ] go
07:40 you've let it all go
07:41 Secret Service you let it all go you
07:44 letting these people do this [ __ ]
07:45 without ever being visited so don't be
07:48 surprised you are creating the
07:51 narratives to make this happen and
07:52 that's my caution to that camp it's just
07:56 stupid it's just stupid get on the ball
07:58 it's a felony engage and I don't want
08:02 some
08:02 tap on the hand man you're gonna spend
08:05 some time in prison you can think about
08:08 this maybe a solitary confinement you
08:10 threatened to kill the biggest
08:11 commander-in-chief in the whole country
08:13 you don't have to like the guy I would
08:17 not have supported that with any of the
08:19 presidents I can't stand any of them
08:22 Bill Clinton who I think is a complete
08:25 serial rapist that's my belief based on
08:28 him being on the epstein plane over 27
08:30 times leaving behind the Secret Service
08:32 six times yeah I think he was engaging
08:34 in underage sex I don't know if it was
08:37 11 year olds or 17 year olds or whatever
08:39 I still would not support anyone doing
08:43 that in public I may not even support it
08:46 in any way shape or form we have to be
08:48 Americans and and go through our justice
08:51 system due process you have to otherwise
08:55 we cease to become Americans and for
08:57 those of you see yourself as Europeans
08:59 with the same qualities I I would assume
09:01 you'd have a similar feeling right the
09:04 gentlemen that are murdered we're heroes
09:08 maybe not to you but to a very important
09:12 demographic within the country
09:15 that's why they're all killed now am i
09:19 throw in there Jimi Hendrix Janis Joplin
09:21 Jim Morrison might throw Cobain in there
09:25 in fact let's just do them first because
09:28 it's build-up to the big boys now
09:31 there's a bit of a correlation with RFK
09:34 and the murder of those first three in
09:37 the 60s and 70s now they may or may not
09:41 be gigantic conspiracies they may not
09:43 tie back to the pyramid in some cases
09:45 but I think they definitely tied back to
09:47 the narrative that was trying to be
09:49 installed in the United States of
09:50 America which is war is good but now I'm
09:52 gonna piece together and you've heard me
09:54 say this a couple times but I haven't
09:55 heard this ever mentioned anywhere else
09:57 in the world but if you just watch
09:59 History Channel specials okay
10:01 of all things where they were willing to
10:03 tell you what actually occurred no one
10:06 ever makes the connection at the end and
10:08 then the connection after that in the
10:11 connection after that the sell of drugs
10:15 in the world has always been a gigantic
10:18 moneymaker if you study the opioid
10:21 infection of Europe into China it is
10:27 like a 350 year unbelievable thing that
10:33 they were trying to get every single
10:34 person in China hooked on opioids and
10:36 then provided I grew it anywhere from
10:41 India to Europe then they put it on
10:45 boats and they shipped it into China and
10:47 China was like oh this is just a fun
10:49 little thing you can smoke and it makes
10:51 you feel good until they started to
10:52 realize their society started to
10:54 deteriorate and then when they said we
10:56 don't want any more of this crap written
10:58 open fire on them just bomb the living
11:01 crap out of their coast lines until they
11:03 signed up begin to buy it again that's
11:06 why China is very leery of the white man
11:08 because we have not the Americans but
11:11 the all of Europe which is our ancestors
11:14 in a lot of cases we did this to their
11:16 people and so they don't trust us but by
11:21 the time it got to the 20th century the
11:23 1900s
11:25 we have in my research literally Italian
11:30 mafia had figured out where to grow
11:32 various drugs and distribute them and
11:36 they when the Central Intelligence
11:39 Agency all skullenbones folks had
11:42 figured out that they had liquid cash
11:44 and they had amazing power because they
11:46 had liquid cash they were like okay two
11:48 things have to occur we have to shut
11:50 these folks down and we have to take it
11:52 over because boy that's a sweet little
11:54 setup and then we're gonna amplify it
11:58 exponentially way beyond anything a
12:01 mafioso person has ever done we're going
12:05 to personally ship it into areas of the
12:08 Americas that we want controlled we want
12:12 them depressed and repressed and
12:14 oppressed and suppressed I mean it's
12:17 like everything regressed and they they
12:21 did it and they succeeded and even
12:24 convinced their own people to sell it to
12:26 themselves to become users as well as
12:29 you know sellers but if you studied
12:33 mainstream history what you will learn
12:35 is from 1949 to 1959 the intelligence
12:38 agencies probably both the FBI and the
12:41 CIA had scoured the world to find out
12:46 where the stuff was coming from and who
12:47 was involved so by 1959 they've got it
12:52 all they know the names of all the key
12:54 players they know the supply routes they
12:56 know the locations in the world where
12:57 the stuff is being grown they're not
13:00 just trying to shut it down they're
13:01 trying to figure out how to take it over
13:04 now we're gonna walk past JFK's death
13:07 for one second because this happened
13:09 while JFK was alive they handed over
13:10 this this giant list of names
13:14 by the time JFK got into office and gave
13:17 it to his brother and said you're gonna
13:19 be the one to lead the takedown of all
13:23 these folks okay so we know that the
13:27 JFK's the Kennedy family had used their
13:30 a prohibition mob connections to help
13:34 them win the election which really
13:36 angered
13:38 lyndon b johnson who wanted to be
13:40 president who never thought for a second
13:42 he would be the choice as president JFK
13:46 was to be his vice president that's what
13:49 happened in his mind but we'll put put a
13:52 pause on him as well so when all this
13:55 was shut down it appears to me that this
14:01 Central Intelligence Agency said okay
14:02 we're gonna sell drugs but we don't want
14:04 the kind that are gonna destroy society
14:06 we just want you know maybe some lazy
14:09 fun drugs something that's just really
14:11 addictive and we're gonna sell it well
14:14 unfortunately for them the two drugs
14:17 that they really pick to push forward
14:18 was marijuana and LSD
14:22 well marijuana was actually fairly
14:25 easily grown in the United States and so
14:27 a lot of people would just grow a little
14:28 bit dried out smoke it was all brown
14:32 weed at the time and then LSD well a
14:36 bunch of people figured out how to make
14:38 it because it was invented in the 30s
14:40 and so the recipe had been sitting
14:42 around okay and if you doubt any of this
14:46 go look at the there's not much on the
14:48 on the proliferation of the you know
14:51 wacky tabacky the THC but there are
14:54 plenty of videos now released from the
14:57 50s and 60s where housewives and kids
14:59 were all put on LSD and asked to
15:01 describe what they were seeing now you
15:04 may think that's just horrific but you
15:06 have to understand LSD does nothing to
15:08 your body at all destructive at all the
15:10 rumors that it stores itself in your fat
15:13 cells a little reality check on that you
15:17 would have to be massively obese and you
15:19 would have had to have consumed a
15:20 tremendous I'm not a velocity in your
15:22 lifetime and then I'm assuming that very
15:25 quickly after that you would have to
15:26 have quickly lost a tremendous amount of
15:29 weight where you're burning all these
15:31 fat cells and maybe there's a little bit
15:33 stored in there I think that's mainly BS
15:36 okay but what did it do when JFK was
15:40 assassinated lyndon b johnson starts the
15:43 vietnam war almost instantaneously with
15:45 two events that never occurred the gulf
15:47 of tonkin events which is a fake story
15:51 about how the vehicle Navy attacked our
15:53 Navy and therefore we had a reason to go
15:55 into war his reason for starting that
15:58 war was a reward system to the bankers
16:02 for allowing him to kill his running
16:05 well his partner JFK so he could become
16:08 president we'll come back to all that
16:10 don't worry now something weird happened
16:14 these agents apparently never took the
16:17 drug themselves and figured out that Wow
16:22 LSD makes you see God makes you see love
16:26 makes you see the universe makes you
16:28 understand how absolutely pointless
16:30 hurting another human being is as a
16:33 matter of fact is so heightened everyone
16:35 senses that people realize that we have
16:37 been utterly dormant for thousands of
16:39 years that the shaman and the priests of
16:42 yesteryear used to eat equivalent
16:45 versions of loosen antic loosen the
16:47 genic drugs and they saw all these
16:49 geometric patterns that you find in all
16:51 the churches and they really became so
16:54 spiritually enlightened that they could
16:56 guide humanity where humanity had never
16:58 been guided before but now it came down
17:00 to the people okay so what happens
17:04 eventually in the 60s we get the hippy
17:07 movement which is very much against the
17:10 war and of course they're demonized to
17:13 this very day if they were right go ask
17:16 any Vietnam vet we should have been
17:19 there you know spitting on a soldier
17:22 well that's something you should get
17:23 your ass slapped unconscious for that's
17:27 a total lack of perspective soldiers
17:30 just doing what they're told to do
17:31 they're trying to do what's right and
17:33 they've been a doctor needed don't blame
17:35 them for being innocent and naive and I
17:39 even a good way and in just trying to be
17:42 a good person and defend freedom and all
17:44 that kind of stuff right so heroin was
17:51 in full production at 49 but we knew it
17:54 was pretty pretty intense stuff it could
17:58 ruin your entire life you could OD on it
18:00 I guess it stops your heart is what I've
18:04 been told
18:04 if you take too much of it just relaxes
18:07 you out of your heartbeat
18:09 okay so LSD is no longer pushed around
18:15 by the intelligence agencies but it's
18:17 picked up by you know the Grateful Dead
18:20 drummers wife it's picked up by a bunch
18:22 of guys who know how to make it it's all
18:24 over the place and so heroin starts
18:27 entering the game in the mid 60s to
18:28 start kind of maybe curtailing some of
18:30 this lack of control because they're
18:33 trying to make everyone get behind this
18:35 war which is such a asinine idea you
18:39 know you know it's like again I don't
18:40 believe in saint's necessarily but it's
18:42 like imagine a whole society this for
18:45 war being what team are you on and
18:47 you're not on humanity's team right now
18:49 truly defending yourself is a totally
18:51 different thing but I don't think
18:52 America's had a truly defend itself
18:54 since the war of 1812 which is what I
18:58 consider the last real year of the
19:01 Revolutionary War so we get these
19:04 influencers right and we get jimi
19:07 hendrix who's just pulling people's
19:10 minds apart you know he's like get in
19:13 there and look around man it's in there
19:15 you know love don't kill his national
19:23 anthem solo by the way I never got until
19:26 I get probably in my 30s and if any of
19:30 you've ever heard it at Woodstock is
19:31 national anthem solo he starts playing
19:34 the national anthem but then he goes
19:35 absolutely nuts and it's this horrific
19:38 what's beautiful but I mean it's this
19:41 horrific like negative key strange garb
19:46 le goop and then he comes back to the
19:49 the national anthem and then he plays it
19:51 for a little while then he goes back out
19:52 into crazy and then he comes back and
19:54 plays it that was as far as I know
19:56 extremely intentional what he was trying
19:59 to say is this is what America's turned
20:01 into here we are as I'm playing the
20:03 national anthem correctly that's you but
20:06 if you go look at Vietnam War
20:08 it's the craziness then he comes back
20:10 and says this is who we are but this is
20:12 the craziness it's the most masterful
20:14 [ __ ] moment in musical history in my
20:17 opinion I mean it
20:18 like kaboom and he was on the Dick
20:21 Cavett show and he kind of walked around
20:24 what he did cuz he was like I don't know
20:25 I don't want to debate this man if you
20:27 get it you get it if you don't you don't
20:29 talk about a gentle soul that guy was
20:32 men watch every interview with Hendrix
20:34 listen to everyone talk about what he
20:36 was like as a human being he was a calm
20:39 beautiful soul he died at 27 years old
20:42 but I mean he died at 27 going on 200 he
20:48 dies in a motel in England he dies in a
20:52 motel with an undigested bottle of wine
20:54 in his stomach which is a very famous
20:57 way that mobsters loansharks especially
20:59 killed people didn't pay their debts may
21:03 have been legit may have been legit he
21:06 supposedly owned five loan sharks a ton
21:08 of money and he borrowed for drugs and
21:10 his lifestyle but he had 74 or so
21:13 pending you know record contracts at the
21:16 time so he knew he had the money coming
21:18 in he just needed to you know float
21:20 himself properly and he got a little
21:21 over over the barrel you might say of
21:27 course there's a bunch of controversy
21:28 about whether Anna's girlfriend was
21:30 there when he died or whether or not she
21:31 found him I think she lied that she was
21:33 there and then she had the straighten
21:35 out her story and say well I found him
21:37 undigested wine is how they do it they
21:39 show up a bottle down your throat and
21:41 somehow it drains into your stomach and
21:43 you basically I guess suffocate I don't
21:47 think it's a toxic shock death because
21:49 undigested it's very shortly after that
21:52 we lose Janis Joplin to a massive heroin
21:55 overdose and then very quickly after
21:57 that I believe it's in that order Jim
21:58 Morrison dies of another massive
22:00 overdose but you're talking about Janis
22:04 Joplin who was definitely a girl who
22:06 struggled she seemed to keep her demons
22:09 alive but it helped her music her music
22:13 her voice is like no one else's voice I
22:15 mean my god this woman there's you know
22:18 Tina Turner was very similar to her but
22:20 Janis Tina was they was interested in
22:22 repairing her life and becoming positive
22:24 whereas Janis just couldn't escape it in
22:27 my opinion but she was very young she
22:28 was only 27 it takes time to get it
22:31 through
22:31 major things but she wanted to be the
22:34 pretty girl but she wasn't the pretty
22:36 girls want to be the popular go but she
22:37 wasn't the pocket she says this in her
22:38 interviews her lyrics also say it Jim
22:42 Morrison well his his band members
22:44 described him the best they said I think
22:46 he was a Greek god that just came down
22:48 to visit one more time I wasn't a huge
22:52 doors fan but now that I have grown up
22:58 but I study his music and again he dies
23:01 at 27 and you're like oh my yeah you did
23:03 all that music before you were 27 and
23:05 its profound some of it you know so my
23:08 hats off to all three of them but three
23:11 influences were taken out of the world
23:13 because they were not into war bin but
23:19 the hippy movement just strengthens
23:21 because now they have three martyrs
23:23 kinda you're living for their message
23:26 now these amazing people so the CIA's
23:29 goin [ __ ] we got to have another event
23:31 something that will totally clean up
23:34 this hippy movement and that's where you
23:37 get the Charles Manson murders yeah who
23:41 knows who Charles Manson was you read
23:42 about his history as a kid and it's like
23:44 again who knows what's true
23:46 who knows what's not the second he gets
23:48 arrested he didn't kill anybody
23:50 everyone else got arrested like whatever
23:52 won them got little let go and the other
23:54 one died in prison or something anyway
23:56 he it's you know frame for the whole
23:58 thing and you know hey it's one of these
24:01 things if someone told you to go kill
24:03 somebody and you did and they didn't
24:04 give you money for it they're just
24:06 shooting your mouth off but to get
24:09 arrested for it's a little strange
24:10 especially a life sentence is a little
24:11 strange but the second that guy gets
24:14 into into the prison system they keep
24:18 him so drugged out of his mind and
24:20 especially what they do is they let him
24:22 have it they let him smuggle it in they
24:24 don't stop the drugs they make sure
24:26 someone has that a guard or US an inmate
24:28 gets it from a guard or whatever how
24:30 brother smuggling in he always gets
24:31 plenty and he always gets a big dose
24:34 before all of his interview so he seems
24:36 like he is nuts but what's weird about
24:39 it is if you have the guts to watch his
24:41 interviews which are not easy to watch
24:43 but you want to go all the way back to
24:44 the very beginning
24:45 and all the way back up to when he died
24:48 he says some amazingly profound things
24:51 if you especially know what we know
24:54 about the world now when you're awakened
24:56 he was totally awake yeah I should have
24:59 anyone have died of course not you know
25:02 because the [ __ ] out there like that
25:04 cross-wired well usually the rules
25:06 people shoot a dud yes I'm saying no
25:11 none of the you know the regulars but
25:13 some of the newcomers might throw that
25:15 out there so that's not what I'm saying
25:17 by the way go see once upon a time in
25:21 Hollywood man is that got amazing ending
25:24 to a roof Brad Pitt's best acting in my
25:28 opinion but as soon as the Manson
25:31 murders happen the hippie movement is
25:32 dead everyone's going to the Haight
25:35 Ashbury Street in San Francisco to
25:37 retire who wants to hang on to that
25:39 movement a few of them end up in Santa
25:41 Cruz but worldwide it's over it's over
25:45 men you can't be associated with these
25:47 crazy druggies who go into a house and
25:51 kill people and quite frankly however
25:54 that occurred it was that group of
25:57 people that one often did that maybe
26:00 that would have happened more notes
26:02 right I find it I find it mind-blowing
26:06 that had ever happened because the kids
26:08 of that era were very sweet I mean [ __ ]
26:11 even after that happened you know the
26:12 70s you meet everyone from 75 to 80
26:15 everyone's a goofy man and the eighties
26:18 were goofy you know so I don't know I
26:19 don't know where this killer gene came
26:21 from but it showed up it was bad news
26:23 man so all of these assassinations are
26:27 to return control back to the
26:32 quote-unquote ruling class so let's go
26:37 back to Lincoln Lincoln well what's
26:43 happened to Lincoln in the last 10 years
26:45 they made some movies about him him as a
26:49 vampire killer that was my favorite
26:51 probably the most truthful out of all
26:53 the movies they've made but the bankers
26:58 you pissed them off not only do they
27:00 kill you but they go after your legacy
27:03 and they destroy you and maybe they
27:06 bring out some stuff that's truthful
27:07 about your legacy or your personal life
27:09 that is true and most the time they just
27:12 create it from scratch
27:14 you've heard most likely that Lincoln's
27:17 wife was a nut bag right maybe maybe but
27:23 they would love to take your crap on his
27:24 wife because that makes him look stupid
27:26 dating a crazy woman when if even if she
27:29 was mentally ill at some point it would
27:32 have been their incredible bond of love
27:35 that kept them together but you know who
27:39 knows so what is Lincoln have to deal
27:43 with he's an eccentric human being if
27:47 there ever was an eccentric human being
27:48 what is he six five lanky he looks
27:52 different than all of the other humans
27:53 on this planet
27:54 I mean seriously there's some people
27:56 that can impersonate him pretty pretty
27:58 well with makeup and beards and all that
28:00 kind of stuff but once you take it all
28:01 off they don't look anything like
28:02 Lincoln like Lincoln's like he's he's
28:07 special smart he's articulate but on his
28:13 watch you know the Democratic Party had
28:16 just formed about 20 years earlier their
28:19 run in the south they are created by
28:22 Europe to overthrow our country boy are
28:26 they in full effect today you know they
28:29 were racist as hell they created this
28:33 Confederate Army and they challenged the
28:38 north inky's I'm not saying any
28:42 individual within those parties like it
28:44 your beer your uncle or your great
28:47 Gregory and uncle your
28:48 great-great-grandfather anything like
28:49 that that those are bad people not
28:51 saying that at all we never know what
28:53 the hell is going on until after its
28:55 occurred as something you have to
28:56 remember too so a lot of folks will do
28:59 horrible things and then wake up out of
29:01 it and going what the hell was I
29:02 thinking that's because everyone you
29:04 lived next to drank the same kool-aid
29:06 and so it was easy to get group that
29:08 groupthink going a groupthink is a super
29:10 powerful
29:11 real mental thing that's why the mob
29:14 rules right you get people in mobs and
29:16 they'll just do things they'd never do
29:18 ever and then as soon as they wake up
29:20 the next day and sober up whether it be
29:23 by alcohol or straight up just mental
29:25 and doctrine ation they're ashamed and
29:27 they'll kill themselves I mean it's it's
29:30 a very powerful drug but what did the
29:32 south want and what did the north won
29:33 and I have heard all of the arguments
29:36 against what I'm about to say so please
29:38 be aware I've heard these arguments I
29:40 don't buy it
29:41 the South relied on slavery to run
29:45 plantations
29:46 owned by very rich European people then
29:50 would ship profits back to their
29:52 European investors oh sure they were
29:55 very rich as well and probably after a
29:57 few years they were capable of
29:59 sustaining themselves without taking
30:00 outside investment but they didn't buy
30:03 all that land by themselves and they
30:04 didn't have you know all these crops
30:07 staying in America some of it was put on
30:10 ships and sit back to to Europe and
30:13 other places in the local region right
30:14 so there's a difference in doctrine the
30:19 North had started to abolish slavery
30:21 wasn't legally abolished but it was
30:24 starting to happen the slaves of the
30:27 north would dress in dresses and tuxedos
30:30 and live in a house and they didn't
30:33 necessarily go outside and plow a field
30:35 because I can tell you by the 1630s
30:40 my first family members came over they
30:43 went straight into plantations in fact
30:46 that that continue to occur all the way
30:48 up into the eighteen hundreds with a
30:50 different branch of my family so if
30:54 there were blacks working in the north
30:55 they're probably working beside White's
30:57 as well we're paying off their debt that
31:00 they accrued by getting a free ride
31:02 technically over the ocean to this new
31:05 promised land but then they had a debt
31:07 so gigantic and they are you know what
31:09 ninety-five cents on the dollar let's
31:11 just say percentage-wise went back to
31:13 the plantation five cents goes to their
31:15 principal debts they're gonna be stuck
31:16 on that plantation in their whole life
31:18 all my family members had to escape in
31:22 the night
31:24 to get free and it was just a common
31:27 thing new ones are coming off the boat
31:29 so whatever they did they got their
31:32 money's worth so no one chased him down
31:34 so here's Lincoln he gets slammed with
31:38 the war and wars aren't easy to fight
31:41 you know these are civil wars men civil
31:45 wars are huge I mean just look at the
31:48 death toll of the Civil War
31:50 it is massive some of the massacres that
31:53 we orchestrated against each other are
31:56 breathtakingly mind-blowing in terms of
31:58 the fatalities and the and the types of
32:01 injuries I mean shooting a cannon into a
32:03 crowd of people you have a ball made of
32:07 steel traveling you know just under the
32:10 speed of sound coming right at you
32:11 it's just tearing people to pieces I
32:14 mean they just just march right into a
32:17 man the balls on these dudes been the
32:19 conviction to die for what they believed
32:23 in I mean these snowflakes and these AOC
32:26 s in these omar's that are trying to
32:27 literally infiltrate our country and
32:29 destroy it from the inside the
32:32 unbelievable cowardice they have where
32:34 you have been who watched their buddy
32:36 just disintegrate when a cannonball hits
32:39 them and they're still going to fight
32:41 for the Constitution of the United
32:42 States and the Republic which is these
32:44 an alien rights you get because you're
32:46 alive so the Civil War got expensive
32:50 Lincoln does what everybody does he asks
32:55 his administration well what do we do if
32:58 we need more money they said well the
33:00 only place we can really go is Europe
33:04 that's the way we always go we borrow
33:06 money from rich people in Europe and
33:07 then we we take a note a bond towards
33:11 that debt it's got a big interest rate
33:13 on it and and we fought our war and when
33:15 it's over we spend decades paying off
33:17 that debt this book I believe claimed
33:23 that if it's not the book at some other
33:26 thing I read but the Rothschilds were
33:28 right there right there waiting to to
33:32 fund it because of course they're gonna
33:34 fund both sides that's what they've
33:36 always done
33:37 same-same shell whatever the hell his
33:39 name is started doing his thing they
33:42 told Lincoln
33:43 well loan you the money your interest
33:46 rates gonna be thirty six hundred
33:48 percent can you imagine that one dollar
33:54 multiplied times 3,600
33:57 so it's 3,600 dollars back for every
33:59 dollar we loan you
34:00 and of course Lincoln's like are you
34:03 kidding me I I don't think I'm gonna pay
34:06 that let's try to talk this out and of
34:08 course they're like no that's it we run
34:10 the world you have no choice and if you
34:14 don't behave we're gonna go ahead and
34:16 fund the South at a lower percentage and
34:17 you're gonna lose so you're like okay
34:20 okay nice talking to you he goes and
34:26 says look what stops us for printing our
34:28 own money isn't nothing we just haven't
34:31 done it before we haven't done in a long
34:33 time since Amundsen sold us out all
34:37 right so he starts printing what is
34:40 called the greenback why was it called
34:42 the greenback
34:43 well as I understand it predominantly
34:45 the backside of the money was extremely
34:47 green because they had one ink it was
34:50 green and he starts printing legal
34:54 tender that wasn't connected to the
34:56 cartel of royalty and banking cartel
35:01 families and you're right hapsburgs your
35:06 Rothschilds or two non royal families
35:10 that own the royal families and there's
35:11 many more where that comes from and he
35:15 ends up winning this war but now at the
35:20 same time what's going on as soon as he
35:23 starts that and stress distributing
35:25 those funds the word gets back to the
35:27 European banking cartel they start
35:31 writing articles about him I guess in
35:35 rags between the two factions right they
35:38 write a little loose letters and stuff
35:39 to each other to kind of communicate
35:41 because there's no internet I can't just
35:43 be everywhere in Europe and these
35:45 letters were recovered and put in this
35:47 book and it essentially said that if
35:50 Europe ever at the
35:51 European citizens ever get wind of what
35:54 Lincoln's doing we're done because
35:56 they're gonna demand that we printer it
35:57 print their own money in Germany and
35:59 France and England and Spain and all
36:01 these places Italy and no one's gonna be
36:03 taking our fake money with all this
36:05 crazy compound interest slash debt and
36:10 so they decided there's something that
36:11 needs to be done about this Lincoln dude
36:14 well in comes this soon to be washed-up
36:18 actor John Wilkes Booth yeah he's an
36:24 actor you know today we might think oh
36:26 he's probably a Brad Pitt I mean would
36:28 never do something like that
36:30 there's no contesting that he did it
36:33 it's just how did he do it and what
36:36 happened to him afterwards will they
36:39 start writing letters between each other
36:42 all these cartel folks that are embedded
36:44 in the United States of America as well
36:46 as some over in England and one of the
36:49 guys were two letters saying well I can
36:50 get him from the theater to the coast
36:54 one dude writes a letter and says I can
36:56 get him from the coast to England one
36:58 guy says if you can get him to England I
37:00 can put him up on this estate on this
37:01 island just outside of England where he
37:03 can just live the rest of his life now
37:06 I've heard stories okay who can confirm
37:09 anything right but I've heard stories
37:11 that he continued writing letters back
37:13 to his family in America clear up into
37:16 his 70s so the dude supposedly confirmed
37:19 as being fully alive but what's the
37:23 nights where he gets shot in this
37:24 theater Lincoln's watching a play they
37:30 obviously know where he is
37:31 the Secret Service wasn't quite what it
37:35 is today and so he's up there capable of
37:38 being compromised and of course John
37:42 Wilkes Booth being an actor could play
37:44 on his credentials to say I just want to
37:45 meet the president I'm an actor this is
37:48 my place you know and so they may have
37:51 not been able to stop him no matter what
37:53 they did but he cowardly walks up behind
37:57 Lincoln and shoots him in the back of
37:59 the head jumps out of the balcony lands
38:03 on the stage supposedly sprains
38:05 basically people said they saw him take
38:08 a hit and you know oof and then limp out
38:10 of the back of the theater where a
38:12 carriage is waiting for him who then
38:16 starts the plan get him to the coast
38:19 coast to England England to this island
38:22 I'm he was probably on a boat for you
38:25 know what three weeks or so what however
38:27 long it takes to get over there at the
38:28 time and so easy was in for a major ride
38:31 but then he's getting rewarded beyond
38:33 his wildest dreams but now history says
38:38 that he retreated into a barn and
38:41 instead of killing the guy or arresting
38:44 the guy I mean think about you don't
38:47 have like Ozzy's with you know 120 round
38:49 clips and you know also their stuff so
38:51 they could have worn him down out of his
38:53 ammunition in two seconds and gone in
38:55 there and captured the guy but instead
38:56 of doing that to find out who perhaps
38:59 may have hired him why he did it
39:01 they set the barn on fire and he dies of
39:06 smoke inhalation that seems to be a very
39:07 popular lie like Benghazi the Ambassador
39:11 did not die as the movie said inside the
39:13 embassy he was dragged out into the
39:18 streets hooked to a motorcycle mutilated
39:22 and eventually dies in the streets that
39:26 movie about Benghazi is a complete
39:28 revisionist history disrespectful
39:31 reenactment of what this guy actually
39:33 went through so they pulled this body
39:37 out of the barn
39:37 they say that's John Wilkes Booth well
39:39 almost nobody knows what the guy is
39:41 because he's an actor well no one can
39:44 really vouch what he really looks like
39:45 except for his best friend because
39:49 actors were makeup they were wigs you
39:51 know he could be himself in a play he
39:54 could be somebody else in a play his
39:58 best friend attends his funeral which is
40:00 an open casket funeral he is then
40:03 questioned by the press what would you
40:04 think about seeing your friend not
40:08 assuming that he's going to answer it a
40:10 completely different way but his friend
40:11 said I don't know who that is in that
40:14 casket but that's not my friend John
40:16 Wilkes Booth
40:17 and they said what are you talking about
40:19 he said well John Wilkes Booth have the
40:21 greatest head of hair ever dudes 25
40:23 years old this guy said well my friend
40:28 is black hair and more of it than anyone
40:31 I've ever met and the guy in that casket
40:33 has receding hair and it's obviously red
40:36 and it's been dyed with stage makeup dye
40:40 hair dye that's not him but you know
40:44 who's gonna print it the printing press
40:47 is you know it's getting yellow but
40:51 they're all over this anyway they're all
40:52 over this kill because they know they
40:54 did it and there goes Lincoln poof now
40:59 for those of you are familiar with
41:00 American coins something very telling
41:03 about the American coins because
41:04 Lincoln's on the penny the lowest
41:08 denomination of money we have which I
41:10 believe in England is called a pea he's
41:14 on the copper penny and he is facing the
41:18 opposite direction of all the other
41:20 coins which are nickel and silver at the
41:22 time their gesture with putting him on
41:26 the penny was that he turned his back on
41:28 the bankers and so they made him face
41:32 away from the rest of the you know
41:35 whatever honorable people that were
41:38 going along with the bankers now again
41:40 the situation where these coins are
41:42 forged of the other presidents was
41:44 probably during a more integral part of
41:47 American history but by the time he died
41:49 you got some infiltrators I can't
41:52 remember if he's facing away on the $5
41:54 bill we should look that up but that was
41:59 a banker booth you were not to mess with
42:02 the bankers so now let's fast forward
42:06 next up would be John F Kennedy I think
42:11 he's born he was killed in what November
42:13 26 63 somewhere in that range
42:16 so the JFK assassination is so dense and
42:21 so messy that there even if we have the
42:25 deep thoughts radio college and we try
42:28 to assemble all of our factoids together
42:30 all
42:31 the rumors and what-have-you the room
42:34 the the war room that we would assemble
42:36 which let's say we had a large
42:38 conference room 30 feet by 15 feet all
42:41 the walls are covered with all the
42:43 Polaroids and the evidence and all the
42:45 newspapers the most of the Magruder
42:49 footage all that stuff it would be the
42:51 messiest room ever and that would be us
42:53 trying to get to the truth of the matter
42:56 now the fact that he was assassinated by
43:00 our people not this Lee Harvey Oswald
43:04 leaning out of a book depository window
43:06 shooting three times is a given fact one
43:11 of my friends in England who's probably
43:14 in his early 60s at this point said that
43:16 when he was taught about this in school
43:18 in England it was straight up our
43:20 central intelligence agent relent
43:22 elegies agency of America killed the
43:25 president United States they just
43:27 flat-out said okay but now why and is
43:34 that really the the end of the
43:37 contribution list by no means I think
43:42 that we have lyndon b johnson who i will
43:44 refer to from this point forward as LBJ
43:49 was unfortunately in an affair against
43:53 his wife with a woman in texas who after
43:58 her son was killed by his estate for
44:01 going insane his illegitimate son when
44:04 his illegitimate son said i'm gonna
44:06 prove that i am the son of LBJ and i
44:08 want my cut from the estate he died very
44:11 quickly from a drug overdose I believe
44:15 and I think it's drug overdose I don't
44:17 think he was murdered quite outright but
44:19 he was a drug addict anyway so it was
44:22 really easy to pawn this off on him and
44:25 get him killed
44:26 when her son was killed she sat her
44:32 backyard and you can see this on YouTube
44:34 I think and she gave her basically
44:38 informal affidavit as what happened
44:42 around the time of JFK's death
44:45 she said the night before the death she
44:48 went to a Elks Lodge and there were a
44:52 bunch of men in a room now she claimed
44:53 to have seen G ogre who ver in the room
44:55 which is very interesting LBJ's in there
44:59 and she said that she was sitting she
45:01 wasn't allowed to go in cuz no women
45:02 were allowed and she's sitting out in
45:04 the lobby
45:04 she said the room got extremely heated
45:06 yelling and shouting definitely in lbj's
45:09 voice over everyone else's voice that
45:12 it's over he pops out the door he grabs
45:15 her and then she says is everything okay
45:18 and he said quote that'll be the last
45:21 time that son of a [ __ ] embarrasses me
45:22 in quote meaning JFK embarrassment
45:27 what's he talking about
45:28 well he was supposed to be President but
45:31 he became vice president instead okay
45:35 the book documents a an event in
45:39 Louisiana New Orleans where just outside
45:46 of the FBI headquarters there there was
45:48 a motel Hotel whatever and there was a
45:51 room where this woman who was an
45:53 assassin for I guess our government
45:56 State Department whatever was asked to
45:59 come to this room she claims she went
46:02 into the room it was three other people
46:04 there and she claims that she saw Lee
46:08 Harvey Oswald in the room everyone was
46:11 taking a pile of cash to get on the
46:13 shooting team against JFK the amount of
46:17 money was five thousand dollars apiece
46:19 in cash and this other dudes handing it
46:21 out fourth guy they offered her the
46:24 $5,000 but she said due to a previous
46:27 engagement
46:28 by the government she was able to
46:31 decline being on the team because she
46:34 wasn't gonna be in Dallas at the time
46:35 she's gonna be on assignment so she
46:38 managed to not be on the killing team
46:41 but not killed herself for knowing this
46:43 was going to occur because of a previous
46:45 engagement
46:47 now let's rewind leo RB Oswald for one
46:51 second before we go any deeper in this I
46:53 saw documentary I believe it was Alex
46:57 Jones
46:58 first posted video on his website way
47:02 back in the day when video finally got
47:03 to the point you could actually download
47:04 something of any length and I think this
47:06 was about 45 minutes long I do not
47:10 believe this is still up there
47:11 it's a kooky video whoever edited this
47:14 together was using obviously antiquated
47:16 editing stuff wasn't an artist
47:17 themselves but boy did they put together
47:19 some stuff man it is always wrong with
47:22 me and I can't shake it and it also
47:24 covered I believe the RFK murders as
47:28 well but we'll pull back and delay that
47:30 till we get to that guy but there is a
47:34 entire conspiracy story which is fairly
47:38 believable that Lee Harvey Oswald was a
47:41 mole from the FBI into the CIA but it
47:46 wasn't going to ever be a direct path he
47:49 couldn't just go and apply the CIA being
47:52 Jagger Hoover's mole and spy on him
47:56 mainly because of the Cuban crisis where
48:00 you know again Castro just so you know
48:03 the history came to the State Department
48:05 and said will you help me take over Cuba
48:07 and we said sure on one condition
48:10 that once you take it over you're our
48:12 asset and you'll do what we say and we
48:14 have a big role in Cuba's development
48:16 especially all your resources that you
48:18 have sugar cane tobacco whatever so he
48:23 gets all this assistance which is never
48:26 discussed and this comes from the
48:27 Ambassador to Cuba from 1958 to 1961 or
48:31 something he sat in the living room for
48:33 twenty five minutes and gave this
48:34 testimony but as soon as Castro wins he
48:39 flips the bird to the State Department
48:40 and that's why the embargo happened
48:42 against Cuba and that's why Castro was
48:44 always considered evil and that's why
48:46 the Castro family is so ostracized to
48:50 this day they don't forget when you
48:52 screw him but the CIA was running this
48:56 invasion to go back and get what you
48:59 know they were like ok you're gonna play
49:00 that ball all right we're gonna
49:01 infiltrate you and take you over so the
49:04 CIA was getting involved in training
49:06 Cuban dissidents in the States here
49:10 preparing to
49:12 Gover cuba kennedy didn't want that to
49:16 occur
49:16 I don't think Kennedy cared I think
49:19 Kennedy was like whatever it's a little
49:20 island yeah yeah well we'll talk to them
49:23 once this Russian missile crisis ends
49:26 and so it is believed perhaps maybe that
49:32 JFK obviously meeting with Hoover who
49:34 had more power than God at the time he
49:37 said I need you to shut down these camps
49:39 he says man I can't get in I can't even
49:41 find out where they are
49:42 he says we'll find someone who can so
49:46 you have this decorated marine Lee
49:48 Harvey Oswald who suddenly defects to
49:52 Russia
49:53 he's on a Russian you know front page of
49:56 the paper over there defecting pictures
49:59 with him and all the Russians supposedly
50:02 you know he defected and brought over
50:05 plans for like the u2 airplane or
50:07 something but regardless he is a
50:09 complete and utter traitor to America
50:13 and then miraculously this dude moves
50:16 back to the United States and doesn't
50:19 get caught by anyone I guess he lives
50:21 outside Dallas he's always in Louisiana
50:23 in New Orleans in that same FBI
50:25 headquarters taken taken whatever
50:28 meetings that was in that JFK movie that
50:32 Oliver Stone put out the assertion is
50:37 that he then showed his disdain for JFK
50:42 and verbally of course and then said I
50:45 am willing to do anything to get rid of
50:47 JFK and so they put him in these
50:50 training camps to help out because he's
50:51 a decorated sniper and then he would
50:54 phone back to Hoover and say this is
50:56 where the camp is and Hoover were going
50:57 to shut the camp down and because the
51:00 see I figured this out they made sure
51:03 that Jagger Hoover's mole was blamed for
51:09 the whole thing which might be why
51:11 George Herbert Walker Bush finds himself
51:13 on the steps of the Book Depository and
51:17 why he used Ford's funeral and eulogy to
51:20 say we shouldn't believe in outrageous
51:23 conspiracy theories about the death of
51:25 JFK
51:26 I mean talk about a conscience that he
51:27 could he couldn't get rid of right he
51:30 held that for nearly 40 years 50 years
51:32 almost right but now George Herbert
51:35 Walker Bush is involved too but how was
51:38 he involved
51:39 well this documentary I clearly points
51:44 out the fact that as soon as George
51:46 Herbert Walker Bush what he crashed two
51:47 planes during World War two doesn't die
51:50 comes back to the States his father
51:52 who's a skull and bones
51:54 he's the skull bones and his sons are
51:56 skull bones his father had a guy that
51:59 gifted the family an oil company in the
52:02 Gulf of Mexico it was called sapota oil
52:05 which stands for Bush I believe in
52:08 Spanish and so he's trying to run this
52:11 company and it has boats it has three
52:14 boats at least the barber one the barber
52:18 two and the barber three not sure what
52:21 the make and model is but I think the
52:22 third one was pretty large when the Bay
52:26 of Pigs the curse you have a situation
52:29 where the CIA had finally trained all
52:32 these folks don't know how many they
52:34 were put on a barber three boat waiting
52:38 for the approval from the President to
52:41 authorize this invasion of Cuba but JFK
52:45 won't do it
52:45 and so that ambassador who did his
52:48 little speech on and this little sorry
52:51 enough speech but he did this video in
52:52 his living room he said he was at the
52:55 third floor of the State Department when
52:57 the call came in were going to plan B
53:00 when plan B was to kill every single one
53:03 of these people on purpose to embarrass
53:05 the president United States according to
53:07 this guy he made this video
53:09 the barber three boat was used to drop
53:11 them off in the Bay of Pigs a phone call
53:14 is made to Castro telling them that this
53:17 is occurring and so he just ran a bunch
53:19 of planes over and bombed him killed
53:21 every single one of them cuz they're
53:23 jumping out in three foot deep mud so
53:25 they can't move the second they get out
53:27 it was a total human slaughter to
53:30 embarrass the president okay so now
53:34 you've got the State Department angry at
53:37 JFK
53:37 you've got the intelligence agencies
53:39 angry at JFK now apparently George
53:44 Herbert Walker Bush again jumps out of
53:46 the military goes into this private oil
53:47 thing he said he did absolutely no
53:50 military service whatsoever until he
53:52 became vice-president under Reagan
53:56 except he ran the CIA out of thin air in
54:00 1974 oh that's a little weird isn't it
54:06 sort of an important operation and the
54:08 only people allowed to run er back in
54:10 those days were skull and bones
54:11 graduates right alumni and he's there to
54:17 watch the murder happen there's a
54:18 photograph of him on the Book Depository
54:20 steps if nothing else he has one of the
54:24 most unique shaped skulls on planet
54:26 earth he's a V was a very tall man and
54:28 the guy in this picture matches all of
54:30 the facial recognition you would ever
54:32 need to identify him Richard Nixon
54:36 Richard Nixon hated the pretty boy JFK
54:40 if you go look at some of the oldest
54:43 pictures of the Bohemian Grove the
54:46 little weird group that gets together in
54:48 Northern California you will have a
54:50 picture of Kennedy or sorry excuse me
54:55 you will have a picture of Ronald Reagan
54:58 William Tell or Teller
55:01 the guy who'd been at the h-bomb and
55:03 Nixon all sitting at a picnic table in
55:06 suits
55:07 well Nixon was definitely a bad guy he's
55:15 in Dallas as well to watch the killing I
55:17 believe he flew to Oklahoma City or
55:20 something and then he was hit by the
55:22 press age where you in Dallas and he
55:24 said no initially eventually they proved
55:26 he was there and then you know whatever
55:27 just fizzles out so he's there as well
55:31 but who did the killing well they said
55:34 that the mob wanted to kill Kennedy
55:37 because well RFK was shutting him down
55:40 left and right now whether or not this
55:43 is the same mob that got him into office
55:47 I would contest it's not the same
55:49 division of mob bosses know whether or
55:52 not they have an alliance on the
55:53 and and would help yeah it doesn't
55:56 really matter I don't think any mob
55:58 hitman participated in this at all maybe
56:02 I'm wrong we don't know how many
56:04 shooters that were I think this book
56:08 asserts that the minimum amount of
56:09 forensics evidence from bullets
56:12 ricocheting off curbs through
56:13 windshields through chrome molding plus
56:15 the shots that hit Kennedy get the
56:17 number up to about 12 confirmed but that
56:20 the rumor in the background was that
56:22 there was up to 27 people hired to do
56:24 the job whether or not people get to
56:26 take their shot or not is contestant you
56:28 know you might be an ancillary shot that
56:31 happens way down the street you never
56:33 get your shot I think the driver of the
56:36 car was the true last resort killer and
56:39 they just knew they were gonna kill
56:41 everybody in the area round him all up
56:43 if you saw anything you were dead
56:44 there was a Cuban man we're gonna talk
56:48 about it held up a black umbrella but
56:49 we're not quite there yet what else was
56:51 Kennedy up to well once he saw the
56:56 Central Intelligence Agency muscling him
56:59 for this Cuban invasion and then pulling
57:02 stunts like the Bay of Pigs he and he
57:05 just immediately said well they have to
57:06 be shut down which is why he gave his
57:09 incredible speech about secret societies
57:12 which I'm sure all of you have heard but
57:14 if you haven't heard it it will blow
57:15 your mind you know what it's actually
57:17 good to hear it about every quarter of a
57:20 year every three months because the more
57:22 you consider yourself awake this do was
57:25 over the target men he knew everything
57:29 his articulation about their powers was
57:33 more accurate that I think anyone in the
57:36 modern age has ever described including
57:38 myself and he did it in one little
57:41 speech and not in five well let's just
57:44 say I've 600 hours worth of footage it's
57:46 not
57:47 none of it totals up as beautiful as his
57:49 speech so you have an intelligence
57:53 agency that once have gone because
57:54 they're threatened he is very there he's
57:57 threatening they're very power structure
57:58 and they're architects of this country
58:01 because they're here to enforce banker
58:04 rule because the skullenbones win for
58:07 believe in 1834 said that they're gonna
58:09 take over America by all financial means
58:11 necessary and that's exactly what they
58:14 did with the 16th amendment that was
58:16 falsely ratified in 1913 you remember
58:19 there's at least three states that said
58:20 that they were held at gunpoint on
58:22 Christmas Eve or whenever it was to
58:24 ratify this bill Kentucky Pennsylvania
58:28 and I believe Oklahoma all said
58:31 especially Pennsylvania they said they
58:33 were held at gunpoint to sign this thing
58:35 to vote for it and then of course Taft
58:38 the recently outed president was on a
58:42 train caboose trained tour with William
58:46 Hearst yellow journalism King and
58:48 Woodrow Wilson with his his moon
58:51 controller it's Colonel moon I think is
58:55 what they called him but he they went
58:57 around telling the world that it was
58:59 ratified
58:59 isn't this great you're all about to get
59:01 taxed to death enjoy it you morons just
59:04 so you know taxes before the 16th
59:07 amendment were corporations Tobacco and
59:09 Firearms so luxury items and
59:12 corporations that paid all the bills and
59:15 so what they did on Jekyll Island was
59:17 all the bankers got together rewrote all
59:19 of the tax code to make sure that the
59:21 the country gave tax exemptions to the
59:24 corporations to put all the burden on
59:26 the back of the people keeping the
59:28 luxury tax at the same time but who else
59:31 wanted JFK dead more than anyone on
59:35 planet Earth
59:36 LBJ LBJ was a member of what they called
59:41 the white knights a democratically run
59:44 Ku Klux Klan in suits again the book
59:51 called the last jihad written in 1993 by
59:55 the nephew of the governor who I believe
59:57 as governor Keating of Oklahoma wrote a
60:00 book about the Federal Building in
60:01 Oklahoma City being bombed by a Tom
60:03 McVeigh in 1993 in the front of the book
60:06 is dedicated to the white knights hmm
60:10 interesting
60:11 well it just goes deeper deeper doesn't
60:13 it so I believe that through all of my
60:18 connections and all the stuff I've ever
60:21 rumored and then logic applied to it all
60:25 LBJ goes to this cartel probably the
60:30 Intelligence Agency and said look I can
60:33 get him killed him in Dallas and I just
60:37 need your permission I don't want you to
60:38 kill me if I do it I need your help
60:40 protecting the press protecting all the
60:42 evidence
60:43 I'll get the shot through his head you
60:45 need to take over everything else and of
60:48 course they said what's your plan all
60:51 right that looks good let's do it and
60:53 then the day of infamy occurs so let's
60:58 go to the day of now typically as a
61:04 matter of protocol the Vice President
61:06 the president are not allowed to be in
61:08 some public event like that at the same
61:10 exact time - campaign rallies and that
61:13 kind of stuff or at the White House
61:14 where does plenty protection because
61:17 some foreign agency could kill both of
61:19 them we would be without our first and
61:21 second but on that day it happened now I
61:27 have not been able to get a footage of
61:30 LBJ's car but I heard he was in a
61:33 hardtop car while the president's in a
61:35 convertible I can't confirm that but
61:37 eyewitnesses have a couple things
61:40 occurring here now we all know the
61:42 Secret Service were told not to step on
61:44 the back of the car because they were
61:45 getting away the shot and there's the
61:48 famous footage of the Secret Service
61:49 agents jumping off the back quarter
61:50 panels which have these little steps and
61:52 then waving to the you know their
61:55 commanders their CEOs going what the
61:57 hell we're supposed to be here this is
61:59 you know this is crazy can you imagine
62:01 how horrible they felt jumping off that
62:03 car because they were told to and then
62:05 the president actually gets killed
62:08 horrific but what ends up occurring is
62:12 this car goes into this special street
62:14 and if you look at the floor plan or the
62:18 you know the top down view of this city
62:19 it's actually part of a triangle which
62:22 is a pyramid you have to use a train
62:25 track to create one side of belief but
62:28 it's a very masonic ii little location
62:30 secret service guys are pulled off and
62:33 this dude
62:35 they always called the Cuban because he
62:37 was a darker complected guy is sitting
62:40 next to a white guy and he suddenly
62:44 stands up and puts up a black umbrella
62:47 couple things happen at that point LBJ
62:51 is said to have leaned down behind the
62:54 seat that he was sitting behind with a
62:58 big giant military walkie-talkie
63:01 screaming into it then all hell breaks
63:05 loose the first shot obviously that we
63:09 know of went through the back of JFK's
63:11 neck which caused him to lean forward
63:14 and grab his neck the shots are going
63:17 all over the place the governor of Texas
63:19 is in the seat in front of him and he
63:22 gets shot but the other shots were a
63:25 curb behind the car
63:27 the windshield took one through the
63:30 front
63:30 the chrome molding over the held holds
63:35 the window in got one from just over the
63:38 drivers left-hand side I've seen photos
63:42 of all this but boys it's tough to find
63:44 the photos today they have done an
63:46 amazing job worse the major search
63:48 engine the world is the biggest deep
63:50 stator on planet earth right assuring in
63:54 censorship and agenda21
63:56 now what does Hollywood say about the
64:00 conspiracy because the next thing that
64:01 occurs obviously is the JFK gets hit in
64:04 such a way that his head goes back into
64:07 the left we get the birth of a theory
64:12 that most likely wasn't true at all
64:16 which is the grassy knoll
64:18 somebody said you know so my witness and
64:21 again if you're dissing foing you can
64:23 create everything suppose the
64:25 eyewitnesses I saw the smoke coming up
64:26 from the grassy knoll
64:28 okay from the position of the person who
64:30 said they saw the grassy knoll
64:32 smoke cloud they would have also seen a
64:35 human being with a rifle that's never
64:38 added to the story just this little
64:41 cartoon idea that it was over there the
64:44 reason why you have been sold the grassy
64:46 knoll because nobody was there
64:49 now I have red and I'm not even sure
64:52 where the book concludes I can't
64:53 remember they did name supposedly I've
64:56 heard somewhere they named the person
64:58 behind the grass you know and it was
64:59 like a French assassin and ended up
65:01 dying a few years later why should say
65:04 ten years later in South America as a
65:07 result of some other thing he was
65:08 involved in where the shootout got him
65:12 whatever you wouldn't have missed yeah
65:15 wouldn't have missed if you were even a
65:16 remote sniper because here comes Kennedy
65:19 and what is he a hundred yards from you
65:20 hundred feet from you the kill shot is
65:26 from an 18 year old kid in a rangering
65:30 because Dick Gregory is given this
65:34 Magruder footage to then publish to the
65:36 press it was supposed to be this it was
65:39 supposed to be he wasn't supposed to do
65:42 it but he did but a bunch of frames out
65:45 of that movie have been edited out and
65:48 the people that have seen the original
65:50 footage said the car stopped for 11
65:53 seconds now I've seen some footage if
65:58 nothing else I haven't seen the stopped
66:00 footage I think bill Cooper tried to run
66:03 around with the stop footage but what
66:06 you see is obviously the hit shot it's
66:09 famous and the car is moving at the time
66:12 so I'm not sure how that stopped 11
66:15 frame thing or 11 second thing thing
66:17 happened I don't know but the car was
66:19 definitely slowed down and two things
66:20 are occurring at the same exact time one
66:24 the et Neal kid in the range ring is
66:26 lining up a shot they have now taken the
66:29 photo measured the car where his head
66:31 was it's a clean shot boom I have seen
66:35 personally the photographs of Kennedy
66:38 having a hole over the right over his
66:40 right eye on his forehead I have seen it
66:43 Claire's bail through his skin and then
66:45 I've seen the actual mutilated version
66:47 of his head after the agency got a hold
66:49 of him and they created this like jagged
66:52 cut like it was almost like a pumpkin
66:54 mouth or something it was it was
66:56 ridiculous looking we know what chunk of
67:00 his head flew
67:02 away from his head and that's what
67:04 jackie was trying to get now there's a
67:07 debate whether or not jackie was going
67:10 to get the piece or was she's trying to
67:11 get the car either one I don't really
67:14 care but the piece of his head came out
67:17 and it was the size of a grapefruit
67:20 this is confirmed by the nine morticians
67:23 that saw Kennedy's body before it was
67:25 stitched back together they were
67:27 interviewed on video and this video
67:29 shows all nine of them saying he had a
67:33 hole in the back of his head this big
67:34 they show the palm of their hand and
67:36 they reach around the back of there all
67:37 nine of them to cut it together like a
67:38 Brady Bunch
67:39 intro so nine little boxes and these
67:41 people all synchronized doing this
67:43 gesture so that's guaranteed the way it
67:46 worked but they stitched that back on
67:47 his head because there's a hole right
67:49 and directly in the center of that piece
67:50 of his brain repeats the back of his
67:52 skull they stitched it back on and said
67:56 that the bullet came from behind by Lee
67:58 / Oswald and it blew out the front of
68:00 his face and of course that the flapping
68:01 blew his head back and of course JFK the
68:04 movie at least so that's probably horse
68:06 crap but they were going for the grassy
68:08 knoll theory because Oliver Stone does
68:10 nothing but revise history these days
68:12 right
68:12 all the Jo kids when the best movies
68:14 ever made he also published the fact
68:16 that I think it was in Malaysia the
68:19 newspaper came out that JFK had been
68:21 assassinated three hours before it
68:23 happened just like the building seven
68:25 being announced that it fell 20 minutes
68:27 before it fell by the BBC where they
68:29 scratched out the transmission and said
68:31 oh you're having a problem communicating
68:32 with New York the buildings in the
68:34 background with the woman saying it
68:36 already felt so she had the script early
68:37 a smoking gun if he ever needed one
68:40 great so what's this stuff about a knee
68:43 chain you know kid did you ever hear
68:45 about that there was a very famous
68:47 eyewitness who was a deaf guy who had a
68:51 hearing aid standing up on the railroad
68:55 tracks looking at Kennedy's car when it
68:58 happened he didn't know was gonna happen
68:59 he's is there he's the eyewitness that
69:02 said the hobos that got off the train
69:05 cars which weren't moving had earpieces
69:08 on there wearing hobo clothes clean as a
69:10 whistle with earpieces
69:12 that's where Britton teaches the the
69:15 Central Intelligence Agency did it hmm
69:18 don't know but that guy said there there
69:22 was a a crawlspace from the sewer
69:26 section down below they came up to the
69:29 railroad tracks and this kid comes out
69:32 covered in crap from his waist down
69:35 carrying a rifle bag he puts it down on
69:39 the ground and walks off in the opposite
69:42 direction across the track that's above
69:44 the street just walking off that hobo
69:47 got one of the three or four that came
69:49 off grabs the gun bag and walks through
69:53 the guys left course everyone's
69:55 disappearing right this whole thing is
69:56 now on stage - the kid worked at a gas
70:00 station the gas station is a
70:02 full-service gas station where people
70:04 actually filled up your gas for you
70:06 while you sat in your car and checked
70:07 your oil and put a new cord in because
70:09 we don't change our oil every 3,600 mile
70:11 like the ridiculous crap with you today
70:13 the kid goes to work he goes to the
70:16 restroom so he's a little building off
70:19 next to the main building and he goes in
70:21 there and his friends saw him arrive
70:23 because there's a shift change about to
70:24 occur and he's late
70:26 they said all they could hear because
70:29 they kept going up to the door and
70:31 trying to see if he's okay because he
70:32 never came out I'll think it here was
70:33 the water running now over the airwaves
70:37 of course everyone's finding at JFK has
70:39 been murdered and the big statement is
70:41 you see something weird you say
70:43 something right so they called it in to
70:45 the police a cop car shows up they get
70:48 him to come out they take him away and
70:50 no one ever saw that kid ever again who
70:53 knows what happened to him maybe died
70:55 maybe they gave a new identity have you
70:59 got the shot but I'm sure the
71:01 rothschilds themselves would give him a
71:02 little little house somewhere right then
71:06 LBJ who's so excited about being
71:08 president he's thought this whole thing
71:10 through he's thought it through
71:13 he gets on Air Force One I believe it's
71:16 one and he has this Bible swearing-in
71:19 thing on camera something that is not
71:22 required by law for him to take the
71:25 position he is automatically
71:26 once the president is declared dead he's
71:30 the president there's no swearing-in
71:31 required but he wanted that event to
71:36 occur and he knows it wasn't going to
71:37 occur in some public event because it's
71:39 not necessary so he created it so that
71:41 he would have something to put on his
71:43 wall so he can swear it in mm-hmm
71:48 now a little bit more dimension to LBJ
71:52 he was a big tough dude okay he is like
71:59 gene Hackman probably times two and if
72:02 you note about Jeanne Ackman he's a he's
72:04 a he's a good nice actor but he's a
72:06 rough tough dude back in the day he
72:08 would beat the living crap out of you in
72:09 a bar
72:10 he's just for the hell of it he was just
72:12 that guy he apologized after he grew up
72:15 but that sir who he was he needed to be
72:17 gritty needed to have his strengths need
72:19 to prove himself LBJ was this guy he was
72:22 a it was a God in the metropolitan areas
72:27 of Texas Dallas he you know was the was
72:32 a head guy of the white knights in his
72:34 area right his mistress said that on one
72:38 occasion they were kissing in her house
72:40 and a Mexican maid saw them kiss and he
72:43 said oh oh then she said what no we
72:46 don't let anybody see us do this and she
72:49 said well don't worry she doesn't even
72:51 speak English very well and she wouldn't
72:53 say anything he goes well we don't take
72:55 chances so LBJ had a Secret Service guy
72:57 take her home and she disappeared they
73:00 killed her
73:01 most likely all right well SCO's on LBJ
73:08 was known for like taking meetings with
73:11 the bathroom door open while he took a
73:13 crap I mean he's just a different kind
73:17 of person right
73:19 he immediately green lights the Vietnam
73:21 War like I said and why is that because
73:24 we're gonna borrow a ton of money from
73:26 those banks and get in debt for this
73:28 ridiculous war there was no benefit to
73:31 Vietnam and I was taking it over and
73:33 North versus South they'll tell you all
73:35 those stories but in retrospect we all
73:37 know it's crap now it doesn't mean
73:40 okay for those that want to get into the
73:43 details that he didn't pass a couple
73:47 good things in his lifetime as a
73:48 president right
73:49 you know me still gonna be a president
73:51 it's just you don't get in his way if
73:52 you get in his way he'll kill you and
73:55 that's what happened in my opinion but
74:00 now a hero's dead now well they knew it
74:06 was gonna be tough as a PR blitz to
74:08 basically completely erase JFK out of
74:11 the books and treat him like Lincoln
74:12 he's been filmed he's amazing now the
74:14 same thing we have to think of the thing
74:16 we have to understand is that you know
74:18 Marilyn Monroe most likely didn't kill
74:20 herself okay so he's not innocent
74:23 you know JFK is not completely innocent
74:26 of weird things right whether or not I
74:28 mean you are Bobby Robert his brothers
74:31 right there when she dies I mean
74:32 supposedly some you know some big
74:35 [ __ ] with Marilyn Monroe's death
74:37 right but the next one I got murdered
74:39 was in February of 1965 February 21st
74:44 Malcolm X gets killed now for those of
74:48 you want to know about Malcolm X's death
74:50 you know you read Alex's Alex Hayes's
74:53 book which is what the Malcolm X movies
74:57 based on now I'm not a huge Spike Lee
74:59 fan on a personal level never met the
75:02 guy he seems pretty into 21 rather no he
75:05 realizes it or not
75:06 hopefully he wakes up at some point his
75:07 life time but you know Malcolm X is a
75:11 bookie as a young man in Harlem gets
75:15 arrested goes to jail becomes a Muslim
75:17 comes out joins the Elijah Muhammad
75:20 group and really tries to become a good
75:24 man and he really takes on this heroic
75:27 position of we need to wake up and
75:30 become a strong black community and so
75:34 he was also because he was a very tough
75:38 guy and so some of his tactics were
75:41 obviously very militant in behavior
75:45 without being you know no guns or
75:48 anything but just I'm not taking any
75:50 more of your [ __ ] and by the way our
75:53 community is going to dress you
75:54 for women and beautiful men men are all
75:56 gonna wear suits and women wear these
75:58 you know sort of this fascist thing but
76:01 you know it's it's probably not everyday
76:02 but you really wanted to empower his
76:06 people now when he is murdered he is
76:11 giving a speech to his congregation
76:13 which had been largely reduced because
76:15 he was kicked out of the list was of the
76:20 the Islamic movement of the black
76:22 community from the Honorable Elijah
76:24 Muhammad as he would say because as the
76:27 book infers he found out that that guy
76:30 was sleeping with all the women in his
76:32 church and he basically said wow this is
76:34 totally like The Wizard of Oz man behind
76:36 the curtain you're not who I think you
76:38 are and so he he rescinded himself out
76:43 of that group and I'm not sure if they
76:44 kicked him out or he pulled himself out
76:46 but I don't think morally he could hang
76:47 on to that and so his congregation
76:50 reduced but he still had followers and
76:53 they knew he's gonna get bigger again
76:54 because he's speaking the truth and he's
76:57 empowering people and they love it now
76:59 the way that the movie portrays it is
77:01 that some black men came into the game
77:06 into the theater the famous phrase was I
77:09 believe get your hand out of my pocket
77:11 and they just blasted him at the podium
77:15 that's how the movie portrays it I have
77:18 heard in the last five years by someone
77:21 who was very educated in this that his
77:24 body forensics said that the shots came
77:27 from above which I believe they call the
77:29 flee way up there in the rafters that
77:31 someone was out there just shooting from
77:33 above doesn't really matter
77:35 a corrupt faction got rid of this guy
77:38 and they thought maybe they had hobbled
77:43 this this rebirth of the black nation
77:46 within America but unfortunately for
77:50 them Martin Luther King was just as
77:53 powerful if not way more powerful we
77:56 should just say he was way more powerful
77:57 than Malcolm X he is a reverend slash
78:02 preacher he's got a brain the size of a
78:06 planet
78:07 Martin Luther King as far as I know
78:10 never wrote his speeches down so all
78:13 those amazing speeches of Martin Luther
78:15 King gave or off the top of his head
78:17 from the heart he was absolutely non
78:22 militant and you can see that you know
78:26 films about him as well but here's
78:30 what's interesting about this book the
78:32 serial killers of JFK are sorry
78:35 Lincoln JFK RFK and MLK they get the
78:38 chronology mixed up in in the title the
78:41 CIA and perhaps even the FBI and I think
78:45 this the book has the transcripts of a
78:47 Senate hearing with the CIA regarding
78:50 MLK in this book is the transcribed you
78:55 know notes of the meeting and they had
79:01 to admit to the Senate that they dissing
79:04 foud the public about him having affairs
79:07 of women horrific they also had to admit
79:12 that they selected Jesse Jackson as his
79:17 replacement and when asked why they
79:21 selected Jesse Jackson as his
79:22 replacement they said quote because he
79:25 posed no intellectual threat to us in
79:28 quote mmm-hmm so this James old ray I
79:33 don't know anything about where that guy
79:34 was on the day of but I did hear an
79:39 eyewitness testimony of a local
79:42 restaurant that was just down from the
79:43 hotel where he is shot on the balcony
79:45 and the owner of the restaurant came in
79:51 with a rifle bag and tried to stuff it
79:55 in you know the back area of his
79:56 restaurant and one of his employees saw
79:58 it and I'm not sure they said anything
80:01 to him but they he went around the front
80:04 course he's really excited because he
80:06 just killed potentially him okay and he
80:09 maybe wants to get out of that area I
80:11 don't know but someone said they
80:13 inspected the bag had a rifle in it and
80:16 it was warm so don't know if that's true
80:20 definitely heard that and again it's
80:22 almost impossible to confirm anything
80:23 these days because they have descended
80:26 upon the information and come up with
80:29 all the back stories of why this
80:30 couldn't happen it's all conspiracy blah
80:32 blah blah
80:33 doesn't really matter who did it other
80:35 than James Earl Ray most likely didn't
80:37 do it and so this guy goes to jail for
80:40 something he didn't do
80:41 and again the Martin Luther King his
80:44 family tried to get him released because
80:46 they says he didn't kill our Father and
80:47 they wouldn't release him because to
80:51 release him is to admit someone else
80:53 killed him and now we got to reopen the
80:56 investigation
80:56 and you might find things because they
80:58 don't have everything covered up I would
81:01 imagine they got it all covered up but
81:02 whatever they wouldn't let the guy go
81:04 that's an April 4th I believe in June of
81:08 the same year 1968 sorry I forgot to
81:10 mention the year and it you know let's
81:14 take a step back for just one second
81:16 what does America turned into at this
81:18 point in the 60s killing is exactly how
81:22 you get done what you need done anyone
81:24 rises up against you you kill them but
81:27 what would happen to that that
81:30 authorization of such an amazing event
81:33 when you kill a famous person my god
81:35 you've got thousands if not multiple
81:37 millions of people who love these
81:38 individuals and you're talking about a
81:40 war you know depending on how the people
81:43 feel about it
81:45 1959 that they charged RFK with getting
81:49 rid of the mom it's their play of
81:52 control they have incubated from 1913
81:55 all the way up to 59 they formed this
81:59 Central Intelligence Agency Hoover's
82:00 completely [ __ ] out of control and so
82:03 the whole thing's moving up for a
82:04 clandestine takeover of this country at
82:06 a apocalyptic level of consciousness
82:09 we're going to change you you're going
82:12 to obey and you're going to take all
82:14 this changes that we need to undo this
82:15 American idea called freedom and the
82:18 Republic so are F K's assassination had
82:22 comes with massive details
82:23 I assure you by no exaggeration the
82:28 sirhan sirhan had nothing to do with
82:31 Robert Kennedy's death other than he was
82:33 forced
82:34 the room while the rent-a-cop behind RFK
82:38 shot him three inches from the underside
82:41 of his right ear but what's going on
82:44 Robert Kennedy does a little stomp it's
82:47 super successful this hotel he's in is
82:50 utterly packed with fans the manager of
82:54 the hotel I believe is an ex World War
82:56 two vet big guy big as LBJ he's seen
83:01 battle he's seen war and ain't afraid of
83:04 anybody
83:05 he is ushering RFK from the front area
83:10 wherever they did this ballroom thing
83:12 through the back kitchen
83:14 unfortunately the Secret Service wasn't
83:16 as refined as they are today and allowed
83:18 there to be like an infinite number of
83:21 people in this room unbeknownst to
83:24 anyone but the people who were in on it
83:27 a black car pulls up outside the hotel
83:30 and a little tiny two-step fire escape
83:34 that goes into the kitchen of this room
83:37 where he's killed a woman in a white
83:40 polka dotted dress so it's a black dress
83:42 with white polka dots is holding Sirhan
83:46 Sirhan's hand Sarang is I don't mean to
83:51 insult the guy I mean to defend him by
83:53 this for all intents and purposes he's
83:56 probably around an 85 IQ guy which means
83:59 he's very peaceful and not aggressive
84:01 he's very docile he lives with his
84:03 mother he takes care of his mother he is
84:06 the only one who can who's bringing any
84:08 money home to his mother so getting
84:10 involved with something nefarious would
84:12 be the last thing on this guy's mind
84:14 somehow somehow this guy got in Caltrain
84:19 okay I did skip over the killing of the
84:22 Harvey Oswald I will get back to that
84:24 because I like to tell after the Sirhan
84:27 breakdown because there's a correlation
84:30 the woman is dragging by the hand he
84:34 does have a pistol on him so the
84:36 chronology is and the physical location
84:39 of people are the following let's take a
84:42 long room I don't know how long this
84:44 room is but let's say it's 50 60 feet
84:47 long
84:47 probably
84:48 about 30 feet wide somewhere in that
84:49 realm 20 maybe and maybe not quite 30
84:52 but maybe 15 to 20 feet wide it has all
84:56 these you know stainless-steel counters
84:59 which you use to prepare food because
85:01 it's a hotel the ovens are against the
85:04 walls right well facing down the if you
85:07 just picture yourself facing down the
85:09 room from the middle midpoint of the
85:11 back wall over to your right about
85:13 halfway down is the doorway to that fire
85:16 escape so here comes the chick with
85:19 sirhan sirhan
85:20 now what's going on with RFK is he's
85:24 having his left hand held by this big
85:27 [ __ ] mountain of a man the manager of
85:32 this hotel wearing a big suit he's
85:36 assuring RFK into the room and he's so
85:40 gigantic he's literally clearing the way
85:42 as he goes the woman pushes sir Han in
85:45 front of him in front of her excuse me
85:48 now he is in front of this mountain of
85:51 the man he's got this pea shooter with
85:53 him it's very very specific this gun
85:58 because the guy behind RFK who's a
86:00 rent-a-cop who hates the Kennedys with
86:03 all his passion he's got the same model
86:06 gun we'll get to him in a second but Sir
86:10 Han is being told some key phrase from
86:14 the polka-dotted woman which is his
86:16 control phrase from his men men cheering
86:18 candidate programming of this MKULTRA
86:20 thing now remember MKULTRA shut down in
86:23 the early 60s United States government
86:26 actually paid restitution to people that
86:27 suffered from it so it's an extremely
86:29 real my desk time thing I've got a whole
86:31 episode on it as soon as I bring in my
86:35 heater here it's like 50 degrees out
86:38 here so sir Han starts firing this
86:41 weapon he is totally out of it he isn't
86:47 just pointed at someone's face and
86:48 trying to shoot it he's kind of shooting
86:50 it and kind of in the air because he
86:52 doesn't have a true instinct to kill
86:54 anybody it's not his nature well within
86:57 a second this mountain of a man who has
87:00 seen
87:01 grabs his guy's hand his wrist and it's
87:05 slamming his wrist against this aluminum
87:07 table in front of them they're still
87:09 table whatever stainless steel table and
87:11 the shots are all going the ceiling he
87:14 knocks the gun out of his hand and then
87:17 he feels rfk go limp in his left hand
87:19 are Keys hitting the ground again here
87:22 the individual shot because this cop
87:24 this [ __ ] is shooting him behind his
87:26 head at the same time sir Hans shooting
87:29 so it all blends together and when
87:31 something chaotic happens no one can
87:33 track what's going on because as soon as
87:35 the first sharts shots start happening
87:36 everyone goes down for cover no one's
87:39 looking up and so this guy goes boom he
87:42 shot JFK so close to his head the cop
87:46 the rent-a-cop not a necessarily a
87:49 police officer ok let's get that
87:51 straight that there's burn marks sort of
87:54 barrel burn marks on RFK skin sir Hans
87:58 hauled off as the killer of RFK while
88:01 this cop walks Kennedy doesn't die
88:05 immediately he sits on the floor
88:07 bleeding out he gets a couple last words
88:10 with someone camera boy what he said but
88:14 he's out of it and then he dies now
88:18 Sirhan is taken to the police station
88:23 and in jail before he's you know fully
88:27 sentenced and sent to prison they
88:29 interviewed the guy if you listen to the
88:30 interview it's it's amazing you hear
88:33 this little tiny voice man this really
88:36 soft mannered guy and he said that he
88:39 was sort of in a dream state and then he
88:40 woke up but he had someone had told him
88:42 that he had killed Robert F Kennedy hmm
88:47 and he couldn't understand he had
88:49 nothing against RFK no political views
88:51 whatsoever he goes to work makes money
88:54 and brings it home to his mother and
88:56 somehow they got a hold of this guy and
88:58 that was the end of his life I believe
89:01 he's still in prison right now now this
89:03 video that was on Alex Jones site shows
89:08 an interview with this cop because he
89:11 was fully accused of killing RFK people
89:15 figured it out they even tracked the
89:17 fact that he owned the gun that matched
89:19 Sir Hans gun he's sitting on a picnic
89:22 table middle of summer and he is playing
89:25 like he didn't do anything they asked
89:27 him well where'd you get the gun he said
89:29 I bought it from a farmer two weeks
89:31 before the assassination well what did
89:33 you do with the gun I gave it back to
89:35 him well who's his farmer I don't know
89:36 some guy lie lie lie
89:38 did you kill RFK absolutely not thought
89:41 of it but they waited till the end of
89:43 the interview and they asked him what do
89:44 you think about the Kennedys knee goes I
89:46 [ __ ] hate him ba ba ba they're the
89:47 worst people in the world hmm so let's
89:52 take that guy's testimony and let's take
89:54 Sir Hans
89:55 men cheering Kenda programming and let's
89:58 go back to Jack Ruby Jack Ruby was a
90:03 tits and ass guy for LBJ and all of his
90:06 buddies aka the white knights he ran an
90:10 I think he owned at least three
90:11 nightclubs in Dallas right it is said
90:15 that on his walls of his establishment
90:18 he always had a lot of anti JFK stuff he
90:22 didn't like to Kennedy's at all but
90:25 there's an interview with that guy at
90:27 the hospital after he turns into the
90:31 whenever the police station where they
90:33 were gonna be transferring Lee Harvey
90:35 Oswald gets the gut shot and kills him
90:38 never hungry Oswald always told you he
90:40 was the Patsy he was right he's
90:44 supposedly by the way downstairs working
90:46 a vending machine at the exact time of
90:48 the shooting of JFK this is Lee Harvey
90:51 Oswald knowing that he's gonna be framed
90:54 maybe because he took five grand I don't
90:57 know maybe had to take the five grand
90:58 simply to play along because he had
91:00 played like he hated America he knew the
91:02 Kennedys and that's how he bowled
91:04 himself into these these training camps
91:06 for the Bay of Pigs invasion he runs
91:09 down jumps in a theater trying to stay
91:11 out of harm's way he's watching a movie
91:14 of course they know where he is because
91:15 they have had eyes on the guy the whole
91:18 time don't lose track of this dude he's
91:19 our guy and then poof he gets picked up
91:22 and Jack Ruby shoots him when Jack
91:25 Ruby's interviewed in the hospital what
91:28 I want you to do
91:29 take Sirhan Sirhan's interview first
91:31 interview after the killing and what he
91:33 said about being sort of in a dream
91:35 state and waking up having shot
91:39 supposedly RFK newsmen he doesn't know
91:41 and Jack Ruby's testimony because Jack
91:44 Ruby said I was driving down the street
91:45 and all of a sudden I just felt the need
91:49 to pull in here and do this and he felt
91:52 like it was a dream state thing I don't
91:55 know if Jack Ruby could be Manchurian
91:58 Candidate I don't know but he played
92:00 this story in 63 and sir Han didn't have
92:03 to tell the truth about his experience
92:05 until 68 hmm okay
92:12 those are the main guys what happened
92:17 after all this right
92:19 well marijuana still kind of runs around
92:22 the world
92:23 it doesn't really cause any major
92:26 problems so it's not really a target
92:28 other than to make it illegal such that
92:31 it sells for a lot of money what happens
92:34 in New York City in studio 54 cocaine
92:39 cocaine arrives its popularized among
92:45 the elites of New York everyone's taking
92:49 cocaine it's the pure stuff it's the
92:51 expensive stuff mm-hmm well you start
92:54 watching what happens to these people
92:56 some people can handle it some people
92:58 can't and they try to push it into the
93:01 ghettos and then it's too expensive so
93:04 that makes it down to crack oh now it's
93:07 really cheap super destructive super
93:10 addictive it's ruined life's over my
93:14 over my world at times right they got
93:17 the ghettos down the ghettos break up
93:21 into these groups in the 80s where you
93:22 got gangs now if you watch documentaries
93:26 about the Bloods and the Crips and the
93:27 formation of these two organizations
93:30 some of the old-school gangsters that
93:32 survived that era are really trying to
93:36 tell the story now it's like you know we
93:38 didn't realize it but we were kind of
93:42 create
93:42 we were getting this drug supply from
93:45 God knows where we didn't grow it none
93:48 of us have passports like easy he said
93:50 so someone's bringing it from outside
93:52 the United States and dropping it on us
93:53 and then we sell it because it made a
93:55 ton of money it's hard to pass that up
93:57 when you're negate oh man but the
94:00 destruction was sort of a bubble
94:03 payments at the end right people start
94:05 taking it a few people lose control no
94:07 big deals they'll not destroy in your
94:09 neighborhood in your own mind and then
94:10 all of a sudden the bubble bursts around
94:13 8687 and now we've got communities just
94:16 under the thumb of drugs but what was
94:23 going on around the same time mmm well
94:27 there's this other drug called heroin
94:28 which is an old tried-and-true drug and
94:32 the market demand they realized could be
94:37 very very high as long as they could get
94:39 everyone addicted to it so what you do
94:40 give out a few bags for free and they're
94:42 ones addicted and then you start turning
94:45 up the prices in to the point these
94:46 people are stealing from everybody else
94:48 and it's heroin
94:51 everyone in production has moved into
94:53 Afghanistan because all the poppy seeds
94:55 grow well they're right in the arid
94:57 climate well because you know Zig new
95:03 Brzezinski dropped into Afghanistan
95:05 during the Afghan Russian war and
95:07 basically indoctrinate amun to this
95:09 radical form of Muslim or Islam Islamic
95:13 worship and Muslim worship they knew all
95:17 the Warlord's they knew how to get all
95:18 this stuff grown and then boom takes
95:21 over the 90s are full of a ton of heroin
95:25 overdoses right now of course we have
95:28 Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison I believe
95:30 it took heroin overdoses but that was
95:31 more of an eclectic thing these guys
95:33 could get ahold it's not that any of
95:35 these drugs were not being taken at all
95:37 times in history it's just mass
95:40 distribution and mass selling changes
95:43 everything why is that this is called
95:47 killing our heroes hmm well if you got
95:52 drugs everywhere and all your
95:54 influencers your musicians your
95:56 juries are all strung out on this stuff
95:58 well then no one has any heroes because
96:01 everyone could be taken down quickly
96:03 now the ADA's had a lot of benign acting
96:06 heroes and a lot of benign musical
96:09 heroes they weren't necessarily saying
96:11 anything I mean I'm a huge fan of the
96:13 band Ratt well look at any lyrics in a
96:16 rat song as as original as their riffs
96:19 are as originals their music is which is
96:21 more than I can say about any other
96:23 bands in that era their lyrics are fun
96:26 it's like what you play on your your
96:28 boat and Havasu is what you play with
96:30 you in a cross-country trip you know
96:31 it's what you played a party not
96:34 changing anyone's political views
96:35 everyone's left alone let's just supply
96:38 the drugs right and there's a few bands
96:40 that are responsible for getting
96:42 everyone else killed but are still very
96:44 popular today so you get one cool guy
96:47 taking drugs boy everyone falls along
96:49 it's really crazy but then you get into
96:51 the 90s and what happens with the 90s as
96:54 much as I always tell you the 90s were
96:56 dark it's kind of because the truth was
96:58 coming out what was for some of the
97:00 bands that we had coming out via Public
97:04 Enemy launches in like 87 86 87 doesn't
97:07 really get mainstream kind of notoriety
97:10 across the nation until about 89 you
97:14 have NWA talking about the ghetto also
97:17 telling you to stay off drugs initially
97:19 did you have bands like Nirvana of Rage
97:23 Against the Machine why these guys are
97:25 still alive probably is a guarantee they
97:27 never did drugs in the first place but
97:31 everyone's waking up kinda it's kind of
97:33 their waking up to the consciousness of
97:35 [ __ ] in some cases now some these
97:37 bands are [ __ ] to begin with right
97:39 so you have I don't mean to insult this
97:42 group whatsoever you do what you got to
97:44 do to make money and do what you love
97:46 but you know I've had someone take me
97:49 through Pearl Jam's original work before
97:52 they became this big grunge band Pearl
97:54 Jam saw Nirvana saw the writing on the
97:57 wall and changed to this really dark
97:58 thing but they were doing some pretty
98:00 pretty poppy stuff before that Landis
98:02 Morissette was dancing in triangles and
98:04 doing all kinds of pop music before she
98:06 became real hardcore
98:08 and the truth of matter is they probably
98:10 found more lyrics and music that were
98:13 true to themselves instead of catering
98:15 to pop they got back to this more
98:17 original gritty things I respect him for
98:19 all that stuff and they definitely
98:21 Oliver made great music don't get me
98:23 wrong but it was the biggest 90s band to
98:28 ever exist and that was Nirvana with
98:32 Kurt Cobain right now there's all kinds
98:35 of rumors about his death his ex-wife
98:40 being probably suspect number one
98:43 I don't personally have any evidence
98:44 I've heard all kinds of rumors or her
98:46 lobbying to get you know gunmen to kill
98:50 him and all those those stuff and then
98:51 he dies in his was living room
98:54 supposedly shooting himself in the head
98:55 with a shotgun mm-hmm I guess you can't
99:00 have an influencer living very long
99:03 right now I don't know anything about
99:05 his political views or him personally at
99:08 all I definitely enjoyed his music but I
99:13 think he was really steering towards
99:14 some much heavier lyrics you know raped
99:19 me it was like crazy
99:21 cathartic song where you have lyrics
99:24 that are just gut-wrenching but a song
99:27 that is just amazing right and it's just
99:29 full of talent you know the girl is like
99:32 I don't know man that dude just he could
99:35 take a spoon in a rubberband and make
99:38 the next top ten song I mean sort of guy
99:40 that guy's so talented it's ridiculous
99:42 but I saw a documentary that broke down
99:46 the fact that and this was not an
99:47 official documentary but they broke down
99:49 his suicide letter and even I think deep
99:52 girl said you know look some of this
99:53 stuff in his suicide letter was like
99:55 lyrics that he hadn't used yet that was
99:58 cut and pasted together so it was kind
100:00 of strange that we were seeing things
100:03 that we had already read before in a
100:05 suicide letter and it was lyrical and
100:06 weird but the shotguns supposedly that
100:09 he shot himself with was not it was so
100:11 long physically that putting it in his
100:14 head and then reaching the trigger was
100:16 actually a very difficult endeavor but
100:20 that's not the most in cream
100:22 evidence that he was murdered the most
100:23 incriminating evidence and I have
100:25 checked this with police officers
100:26 because I write movies with cops in them
100:28 well as they said that the police
100:30 officers had already filled out his
100:33 death certificate cause of death and
100:36 time of death before the coroner arrived
100:39 and that's not the way it works folks
100:43 one of the horrific pieces of truth
100:46 about homicide is that once a well was
100:51 put this way
100:52 I'll give you a reenactment I just have
100:54 did this research for a phone line when
100:57 a person gets mortally wounded but
100:59 hasn't quite passed away yet the police
101:02 officers on the scene can interact with
101:04 the person pull out their wallet figure
101:07 out who they are ask them questions do
101:09 whatever they got to do but the second
101:11 the heart stops and that person's dead
101:14 police officers can no longer touch the
101:16 body not even if his ID is like sticking
101:20 out of a pocket and they all you need to
101:21 know is what's in that ID it's also
101:25 really bad that if a person were to die
101:27 in their front yard say like in some of
101:29 these drive-bys we used to have in LA in
101:31 the 90s the family members are looking
101:35 at their family member dead on the
101:36 ground but the police officers can't do
101:39 anything but call the corner if on that
101:43 particular night the corners are busy
101:46 that body could be there for eight hours
101:48 12 hours and they can't touch it while
101:51 the family observes this and can't move
101:55 their loved one they're not allowed to
101:56 touch the body because it's now criminal
101:57 evidence and in in California for at
102:00 least less only twenty years they have
102:03 to now erect a tent around the body to
102:06 make sure no one can see it just to keep
102:08 the reaction factor down and so they
102:13 said look it's it's back because some of
102:14 these police officers will have to stand
102:16 out in the rain and you know it's not
102:19 never snows here but you need to be
102:20 under 38 degrees it's just sitting there
102:22 watching the body and they can't do
102:23 anything about it so the fact that the
102:26 police officers fill out information
102:28 about him is very very suspect and
102:31 reveals a higher level assassination
102:34 than just
102:36 Courtney Love pulling some trick so in
102:39 my mind it's a stretch for her to be a
102:42 suspect and it looks like it's way
102:46 deeper than that why he's an influencer
102:51 he wasn't under control if that dude
102:54 wanted to write a song about something
102:56 everyone's gonna buy it and one's gonna
102:57 listen to lyrics and that's just too
102:59 much power
103:01 alright who else died in the 90s who
103:06 were influencers well how many of you
103:09 remember the East Coast West Coast rap
103:12 battles you know the we hate them they
103:16 hate us right it's always gotta be some
103:17 stupid divide and conquer thing right we
103:20 have Tupac and you have biggie both
103:23 murdered on the west coast
103:25 technically Tupac's at Vegas I believe
103:28 right so Suge Knight's driving the car
103:31 drives into Middle intersection two cars
103:34 cut them off one dude fills up the car
103:37 with bullets two pucks dead and
103:41 everybody wants him to be alive the guy
103:43 from Jurassic five keeps kingpin down as
103:45 being to [ __ ] a man they do look like I
103:48 will say that much but I don't think
103:49 Tupac would be down for 25 years of
103:52 silence right he was revealing the weird
103:59 stuff going on in the music industry he
104:02 was revealing and honestly what I'm
104:04 about to say isn't against the law it's
104:07 not yeah we shouldn't have any
104:11 necessarily negative feelings about it
104:13 necessarily it's these people's choices
104:15 to live this way but he was revealing a
104:16 lot of homosexuality in the music
104:18 industry and he was on tape being
104:23 recorded you can hear this out there
104:25 saying that Quincy Jones approached him
104:28 for some things never occurred but he
104:30 approached it and dr. Dre has a side
104:35 hobby it appeared at least in the 90s he
104:37 did and he was very frustrated because
104:39 he was like I just want to make music
104:40 and these guys always want to have sex
104:42 since I don't have anything to do with
104:43 that there's a bunch of that
104:46 in the music industry and they call it
104:48 the gravy thing and it's the they say
104:52 you know anyone says it's how you doing
104:55 and they say oh it's all gravy then
104:57 they're in that clan weird there's a
105:00 whole set of documentaries about these
105:03 rappers interviewing each other on
105:05 telephones and talking about all the
105:06 weird shanigan 'z that occurred a lot of
105:09 folks that are perceived as being ladies
105:11 men and being very straight or actually
105:13 not been real life so okay it's their
105:15 choice while they're hiding it's just
105:17 because their their image would
105:19 disappear right tough gangster is not it
105:23 doesn't mean they're not a gangster just
105:24 means they're doing this other stuff on
105:25 the side again I'm not breaking the law
105:27 necessarily unless they're on Epstein's
105:28 plane right there's probably a reason
105:32 why the woman with Prince Andrew on
105:37 epstein Island was also photographed
105:40 with Bill Clinton and rapper Eminem who
105:42 has been totally a Trump hater man and
105:44 now he's trying to get rid of the Second
105:46 Amendment
105:46 they're leaning on him the leaning on
105:49 him hard man and he's caving like crazy
105:51 but Tupac was I think at this point most
105:55 likely murdered by a le cop who was
105:58 extremely corrupt who was then convicted
106:01 of a murder six months later and now I
106:03 think he's been in jail forever I think
106:05 he may be dead now or something not
106:07 quite sure
106:08 the other one is biggie the biggie death
106:12 is probably one of the most overlooked
106:14 bizarre deaths of any kind I think he
106:20 was murdered on Wilshire Boulevard I
106:22 when I ran my startup for the LED
106:25 theater replacement with all the 3d
106:27 stuff in it we were underneath this big
106:31 effects house called the third floor
106:33 downtown right across from sag literally
106:36 right across the street from sag which
106:38 is the acting guild and he was about a
106:43 block down to the west in front of the
106:46 Petersons Car Museum I don't know why he
106:49 was there but witnesses said that I
106:53 think he's shot right but witnesses said
106:55 that the CIA was all over the place your
106:58 ear buds are
106:59 all over the neighbor all over that
107:00 district right down there when he got
107:02 shot it's sort of cleaning up this mess
107:06 this West Coast East Coast thing after
107:09 those two guys are dead it's over it's
107:13 over the rap industry took a big hit
107:15 it kind of wandered around for a little
107:18 while and then finally got back on its
107:20 feet but there was no more talk of that
107:21 west coast East Coast crap but how many
107:25 people in New York saw biggie as a hero
107:30 go look up biggie graffiti his face is
107:33 probably one of the most painted faces
107:36 on the side of buildings all over New
107:38 York that you've ever seen in your life
107:40 Tupac well one he was a genius he was a
107:45 prodigy kid pretending to be a gangster
107:48 he liked his weed he showed up on
107:50 Arsenio baked out of his mind a couple
107:52 times he was enjoying his brilliance he
107:57 was one of the finest rappers that will
107:58 ever live both of them both of them were
108:01 phenomenal I don't care if you don't
108:03 like rap you just listen to a couple of
108:05 their songs and be like damn go look at
108:07 Biggie's Street performances where he
108:10 ad-libbed and did did rap battles with
108:12 guys I mean it's just insane how good
108:15 this guy was but why do why do we have
108:18 people who think these people are still
108:20 alive because they were heroes right
108:25 you know I glossed over I just took
108:28 completely skips like Elvis is death
108:31 Elvis is death because I'm 50 has a very
108:35 interesting spot in my life because I
108:37 wasn't alive when JFK died right but my
108:42 father and I I just tell you the story I
108:45 think I told it once before
108:47 my father was a massive Elvis fan
108:50 because he's a clean-cut guy he's a nice
108:52 guy he used to give away his money he
108:55 was just really an amazing guy I mean he
108:58 didn't have any super nefarious things I
109:01 think his wife Priscilla knew that he
109:03 was doing things on the side not even
109:07 sure how far that went
109:08 right but of course he gets hooked on a
109:11 ton of drugs
109:13 they get him on a drug it was supposed
109:15 to be fighting cancer or something and
109:17 made him really obese towards the end of
109:19 his life but he is utterly controlled
109:22 forgot what the guys who sort of his
109:24 little controller on the side but he had
109:26 one he's surrounded by a bunch of yes
109:28 men who have all regretted the fact that
109:31 they were yes men because they probably
109:33 should have stepped in some of them were
109:35 pretty honest about the fact that even
109:38 if they had said something if the later
109:39 stages he probably would have just
109:40 thrown them out of the clan so everybody
109:42 didn't want to lose Elvis from their
109:44 circle they want to be kicked out and
109:46 ostracized so they they went along with
109:48 it but my dad had a photography he's a
109:52 professional photographer throughout my
109:55 childhood and he has a little studio in
109:57 a town that was twenty seven miles away
109:59 from our hometown which in the Midwest
110:02 is considered a really long distance but
110:04 I was with him and I never remembered
110:07 why I just go with my dad and he'd give
110:10 me money to go to the movies next door
110:12 for $3.75 and then one block over I go
110:15 to Perry's it just since burned down
110:17 because the restaurant next to the town
110:19 on fire and burned him down the best
110:20 chocolate pie you've ever had in your
110:22 life I've never eaten one slice of
110:24 chocolate pie that remotely touches
110:26 Perry's chocolate pie it's like thick
110:30 nice filling you know but anyway that
110:33 would be my day and then we left and it
110:35 was dark out and we're getting into the
110:38 car and we get in the car
110:41 my dad turns on the stereo this is
110:44 before cellphones this is before you
110:46 know everyone having TV in every single
110:47 room and all that stuff and they
110:50 announced that Elvis Presley had died
110:52 and my father just said what and cranked
110:57 the radio up and it was the weirdest
111:00 ride home and now that I look back at it
111:03 you know see I guess my dad was about 33
111:07 years old when that happened having
111:10 experienced Prince's untimely death you
111:16 know I know what he feels like now and
111:18 I'm sure his heart just got absolutely
111:20 destroyed but Elvis was a hero complete
111:25 hero now Elvis didn't have any big
111:26 political
111:27 views or anything so he most likely did
111:30 himself in pretty much the way history
111:32 says no necessarily I don't know maybe
111:35 you guys know more about some conspiracy
111:37 around him I've never heard of anything
111:39 but who is another person that we keep
111:41 saying that you know they say there's a
111:43 groundskeeper his Hellman Memphis that
111:46 is him a really old man so you know I
111:50 don't know I hope he's still alive but I
111:52 doubt he is John Lennon's murder talk
111:56 about a hero I've got friends in in LA
111:59 who are in their late 60s who consider
112:02 him to be their hero John Lennon again I
112:08 never knew this until God probably 15
112:11 years ago that his whole last couple
112:14 years he was doing interviews on the
112:16 sidewalk in New York just calling out
112:21 the CIA and saying that we're gonna get
112:23 rid of them we're gonna destroy them
112:25 they're they're destroying the world
112:26 they're starting all the wars and it was
112:27 like whoa how did this guy get all awake
112:32 but he's murdered what was at the tail
112:36 end of 1980 by a guy that said he was
112:40 killing John Lennon to impress a
112:42 girlfriend he uses his payphone walked
112:44 over and shot him at the hotel that he
112:47 lived in I think he owned two but
112:49 whatever he owns the top floor where
112:51 Yoko stole those to this day he's mowed
112:54 down hero gone conflict with the
112:58 intelligence agency gun and you might
113:01 think well that's just a big stretch you
113:02 know he just was mad or whatever okay so
113:05 less than four months later the same
113:06 exact story is used with Hinckley
113:08 Hinckley he's trying to impress Jodie
113:10 Foster right so he takes a shot at
113:13 Reagan Reagan who had just investigated
113:16 the Federal Reserve and Fort Knox trying
113:19 to find out how much money do we have in
113:20 Fort Knox and two ones last time we paid
113:23 any principle on our debt to the bankers
113:25 and he had these guys off doing the
113:28 investigation and supposedly when they
113:30 came back to him they said look we
113:31 probably have paid any principal past
113:34 1952 so he wanted to change things
113:39 so they sent him a warning shot at
113:41 whether or not he's actually shot or not
113:42 I could test that he may not have been
113:44 shot but the gun goes off and he learns
113:49 who's actually the president and that
113:52 would be George Herbert Walker Bush was
113:54 the president so when I see these
113:57 assassination stories they are
113:59 definitely fascinating but what really
114:00 matters to me is what could happen today
114:04 you have people like Nancy Pelosi who is
114:11 saying right now she said in last seven
114:14 days that Trump will not be President in
114:18 2020 no matter what she is handed out
114:22 pins when she signed this impeachment
114:25 articles and wasted I don't know how
114:26 much money 30 pins it probably 500 to
114:29 $1,000 a pen with little bullets on him
114:32 she wears a bracelet with bullets on she
114:35 keeps sending out all these signals like
114:37 we're ready whenever you want to kill
114:38 him we're ready but now let's think
114:42 about this from a more macro perspective
114:45 every single grave of a soldier since
114:49 the beginning of this country fought for
114:52 at least one thing and that was to
114:54 protect the vote and now we have a house
114:57 leader who doesn't care anymore
115:01 her whole administration is full of
115:04 people that don't care anymore neither
115:06 doesn't care Schumer doesn't care Schiff
115:09 doesn't care and so these individuals
115:13 are now right in your face in a movie
115:17 about this maybe 50 years ago they would
115:19 have been those it would have been a
115:20 ground invasion and fibia invasion a
115:22 parachute invasion of people with guns
115:25 and bayonets trying to kill us all they
115:28 don't play it like that anymore it's all
115:29 intellectual so we now have allowed in
115:34 through voter fraud because we don't
115:37 have a voter ID because the voting
115:39 machines are owned by all owned by
115:40 criminals some of them ex-felons of
115:42 voter fraud again I had communicated to
115:46 me that the first founders of Diebold
115:49 were X voter fraud felons
115:53 well he found a really great side job
115:55 they know all about the gentleman that
115:58 stood up in Florida and said I am a
115:59 programmer for the voting machines that
116:01 Jeb Bush and that Senator bought and I
116:03 literally was told to program the votes
116:05 to switch for one person to the other
116:08 and of course he says it in public a
116:11 bunch of shills on the other side say no
116:14 we don't care and nothing happens right
116:17 we feel like this is all behind us this
116:21 will not happen again you've got a much
116:23 better Secret Service we if you're a
116:25 queue follower you believe the military
116:27 itself with the cooperation of good
116:30 factions in all those agencies I just
116:32 mentioned are now filtering information
116:35 and watching the people that orchestrate
116:37 these events closely making sure that if
116:40 any command is given even in code that
116:42 they find out and they protect the
116:45 president I will tell you that there
116:47 have been at least one true
116:49 assassination attempt on President Trump
116:51 when he was at a golf course in Scotland
116:54 his golf course a guy paratroop in and
116:57 took out one Secret Service guy one guy
117:01 has already given his life for the
117:02 president that is huge we had that
117:06 Chinese lady trying to infiltrate that
117:09 resort with all that crazy spy [ __ ] in
117:12 her purse they're playing for keeps men
117:16 now by the president playing tough and
117:21 by the secret surf service playing
117:24 wimpy we now have more instances of
117:30 threats to the president than we can
117:33 keep track of all of these people have
117:37 gone without any prison sentence and
117:39 without any slaps on the hand the press
117:42 hasn't covered anything in and if you
117:44 believe Fox is totally on your side well
117:46 then you should have heard about all
117:49 this stuff I just told you it happened
117:50 recently and now they tried to hide
117:53 behind paradigms right now I have a lot
117:59 of experience with comedians in Los
118:02 Angeles I used to help dozens of them
118:04 and Los Angeles do their thing
118:06 from 2003 to probably about 2015 I still
118:10 have a couple clients and what they want
118:14 to say is if a comedian goes onstage and
118:16 jokes about killing the president then
118:19 he is he or she is protected by the fact
118:21 that they're comedians oh is that really
118:25 funny
118:26 all right let's let's change the script
118:28 a little bit and see if it still pans
118:30 out let's have some German comedian
118:33 which is already an oxymoron itself was
118:36 that a German communion go up and make a
118:38 bunch of jokes about Auschwitz about all
118:40 the Holocaust stuff about killing Jews
118:43 and tattooing them putting stars on them
118:45 and throwing them in trains let's make a
118:46 bunch of jokes about that and see how
118:49 long that guy has a career it probably
118:52 the last performance they'd ever have
118:54 they did in Europe they probably
118:55 arrested so we can't allow them to
119:00 smuggle through you know bizarre you
119:04 know like it was it Snoop Dogg did the
119:08 video where he did the gun that puts out
119:10 the flag and says bang but it's a guy
119:12 standing there looking like trunk yeah
119:15 it's hilarious man it's just so
119:16 hilarious isn't it what's interesting is
119:19 you know if you write scripts about
119:21 investigations there's always that map
119:23 of co-conspirators aiding in a betters
119:27 people that provide more motive and if
119:30 you think about the Charles Manson
119:31 murders let's think about it Charles
119:35 Manson was put in prison for life for
119:37 simply influencing people supposedly no
119:40 proof but influencing these people to go
119:43 kill you people let's say it's totally
119:45 true okay well then what if whoever
119:50 takes that shot at Trump and succeeds
119:52 simply says well I did it because Kathy
119:55 Griffin influenced me Madonna influenced
119:59 me Snoop Dogg influenced me Whoopi
120:00 Goldberg influenced me the whole view
120:03 influenced me Nancy Pelosi influenced me
120:07 well what's going to happen with all
120:09 those people but I'm gonna tell you
120:11 what's gonna happen oh those people
120:12 nothing nothing
120:15 because the fiber of these agencies that
120:19 are
120:20 supposed to protect against this stuff
120:21 we've all turned into giant [ __ ] and
120:25 if you're [ __ ] listening to me I'm
120:26 calling you a [ __ ] get out there and do
120:29 your goddamn job because we don't need
120:32 that kind of disruption and don't
120:34 lecture me about how you have control
120:36 over everything you don't because as
120:39 long as they keep coming to the battle
120:41 okay they're gonna take the shot however
120:44 many times they need to take it
120:45 obviously it's never happened and I hope
120:47 it never ever happens I mean that's my
120:49 point of this episode we have to protect
120:52 anyone we admire in this world hopefully
120:55 we make good choices and we don't let
120:57 actors and musicians tell us how to pick
121:00 our political party people you think
121:03 they have any time to learn anything
121:04 were you kidding me anything about an
121:06 actor's life or a musician's life an
121:09 acting or sorry I'm an active musician
121:12 who's got a cranked out an album every
121:13 single year as they get there they lose
121:16 their record contract write an actor
121:18 that's got to find a new gig read a
121:20 script every single day get your new
121:22 lines every day and these people are got
121:23 enough time to really get into the
121:25 nitty-gritty they go to parties they do
121:29 things they're not supposed to do they
121:30 get photographed hanging out with spirit
121:32 cooking women you know meanwhile they're
121:34 making a bunch of movies about rape and
121:37 then they say oh I punched the president
121:39 in the face what I mean just saying that
121:44 alone is like you need a visit man you
121:46 need a visit because you're you're being
121:49 a Manson you're being you can kill
121:52 someone with an elbow all right so say
121:55 someone you you mean to tell me that
121:57 like Conor McGregor couldn't kill me
121:59 with the punch if I didn't know it was
122:03 coming that do could kill me in a split
122:04 second with the punch so Robert De Niro
122:08 says a bunch of [ __ ] about me and kind
122:09 of rigueur believes it and he [ __ ]
122:11 finds me where I'm not looking in POW
122:12 yeah if I if I am looking he gonna help
122:15 right you can kill me but now you gotta
122:17 go rest did you know because he
122:19 influenced McGregor nothing nothing
122:23 against that guy you know he can go [ __ ]
122:25 himself
122:26 but anyway I hope this was useful I hope
122:29 you update your view of the world as a
122:33 massive
122:34 jinda pool and a lot of us want to
122:38 believe that certain people have been
122:41 taken out again no one's seen George
122:44 Soros alive since October of 2018 no one
122:48 has seen jacob rothschild rive alive
122:50 since May of 2018 now I was hoping they
122:54 would change their ways so whatever
122:57 happened to them wouldn't be necessary
122:59 but it seems like something happened to
123:02 him don't know Torosaurus may have died
123:04 in an accident the compound of the
123:07 Rothschilds was definitely being raided
123:09 at the time that a plane crashed and
123:10 they haven't seen him since and Jacob
123:13 was doing lots of interviews at the time
123:14 maybe you've seen him do something life
123:16 I don't know but in my smoke lounge we
123:18 watch gigabytes of hours and hours of
123:21 footage and we haven't seen these two
123:23 guys live there's lots of articles
123:25 written about what they're doing at
123:26 least George Soros he's a news articles
123:30 all the time but his son is now showing
123:32 up to these conventions these g8 and g20
123:35 s and all this stuff and George isn't
123:37 there but George was always there before
123:39 so maybe you've seen him alive I haven't
123:42 seen him alive
123:42 throw me something if you got something
123:46 good anyway I hope you feel me on that
123:48 let me know what you think about all
123:50 this stuff and correct any of the stuff
123:52 that you think I got wrong point me in
123:54 directions of documentaries that you
123:56 think are very credible and we'll just
123:59 maybe revisit this at a future time or
124:01 at least if I drop little tidbits in
124:03 other episodes I will do any errata
124:06 Corrections stuff that I need to do I
124:08 think for most of these situations we
124:11 simply don't know but we're just trying
124:12 to piece it together right anyway if you
124:16 haven't gone to deep thoughts video com
124:18 please go and that's where everything is
124:19 and again if anything were happened to
124:21 the channel for any reason go there
124:23 bookmark it forget about it and then if
124:26 you can't find it go there and and I
124:28 will definitely provide alternatives to
124:30 giving episodes but on the video realm
124:33 we've got YouTube they've been really
124:35 good to us I mean seriously they D
124:38 monetize most videos because of either
124:41 my language is really bad
124:43 sometimes I'll just take the hit other
124:46 times it's the title of the video that
124:47 just has
124:48 this video maybe demonetised because I'm
124:49 gonna put killing in its title so it may
124:54 be because this information is really
124:55 hot ma just because the title is a
124:57 keyword that they don't associate it
124:58 with an ad person just keep that in mind
125:00 it's not not everything is so
125:02 heavy-handed right but we're also on
125:04 [ __ ] shoot a [ __ ] shoot is a freedom
125:06 of speech zone everything goes up there
125:08 it's 1080p not 4k but who cares it's
125:11 just my voice whatever
125:12 now the other one we're slowly moving on
125:15 is bright tea on it's not on the website
125:16 because I only have 49 episodes up there
125:18 at this stage we're 330 views away from
125:22 our next 50 so if you do want to go up
125:25 there and just click on videos and watch
125:26 them you know for two seconds and then
125:28 get my video account view up then we'll
125:30 get to the next 50 and then I think
125:32 it'll start organically taking off
125:33 because the next 50 and the first season
125:35 are a lot more popular than the first 50
125:40 which were more me trying to pass you
125:41 the DNA that made my life better right
125:43 on the podcast side plenty links
125:46 definitely consider not using itunes as
125:50 your podcast listener if you desire to
125:52 go back to the first season on your
125:54 podcast or podcast software because they
125:56 only think they have a 350 limit so go
125:59 find pod yeah podcast addict I don't
126:04 know if that's on the Apple platform but
126:05 it is the best one on the Android
126:08 platform by far it's just the updater
126:10 all the time they make it better but it
126:12 allows you to download it while you're
126:14 at your home and then you can get on
126:15 your car you don't pay any bandwidth to
126:17 listen to anything so it's beautiful on
126:20 the social media side we have a lock
126:22 Facebook group with some of the greatest
126:24 people on planet earth we have twitter
126:26 which is also taking off and mine's calm
126:28 mine's calm is a copy of Facebook but
126:30 it's first and then it protected its
126:32 blockchain based I believe and it is in
126:34 my opinion way more beautiful than
126:36 Facebook it is currently white they
126:39 don't have a dark mode but hopefully
126:40 they get that together please sign up
126:42 for bit shoot sign up for mines calm
126:44 because they need your membership to
126:46 grow to get financing and all that kind
126:48 of stuff so that's good there's really
126:50 only two ways to donate to the page and
126:52 there's two products I recommend I tried
126:54 to do the affiliate link thing make no
126:56 money from this stuff so please take
126:58 that into effect but there's PayPal for
127:00 one-time donations there's been if
127:01 you've done it thank you so much and
127:03 you're totally anonymous to me so I
127:05 don't know who you are on patreon it's a
127:10 monthly thing what patreon people get is
127:12 all the episodes usually about day or
127:15 two before everybody else sometimes it's
127:17 four or five days before everyone else
127:18 but it also gets you a 20% to scan on
127:21 the store the two products I recommend
127:24 all the time is the brave browser now it
127:26 is based on chromium kernel which is the
127:29 layout kernel but they don't track
127:32 there's no callbacks to Google within
127:34 the kernels so you're really well
127:36 protected blocks all the trackers which
127:38 and all the movies that autoplay and
127:40 stuff so it is extremely fast in fact I
127:43 don't think I'm able to even see a movie
127:45 on Twitter so if I look at a news
127:47 article in a city push this button to
127:49 see it I can't get it to view it to
127:50 click over to Twitter to get it to play
127:51 that's how much they protect you because
127:53 they they knock off all this extra
127:55 traffic which is 50 to 60 percent of the
127:58 traffic if you go to any one of your
128:00 favorite news sites its way faster and
128:03 they keep track of all the minutes and
128:05 seconds that they say which is really
128:07 cool change your search engine from
128:09 Google deductr go and you'll totally
128:11 poke out the eye of the deep state and
128:12 you'll also remove analytics that they
128:15 can sell to someone else so you're
128:17 really just Neal and it's great the
128:19 other one is if you need any online
128:20 backup Backblaze comm 8 bucks one
128:24 computer infinite storage I have one
128:26 account now 16 gigabytes of stuff out
128:30 there or excuse me terabytes of stuff on
128:35 the cloud it's great it's beautiful we
128:38 have the store so has two new designs
128:40 for season five season three was pulls
128:42 he's before never had one but again
128:44 there's a 20% discount on patreon if you
128:48 need it
128:48 I picked really really thick shirts too
128:52 so you're not going to get all these
128:53 shirts you can see through so you know
128:55 me I wear the same stuff all the time I
128:57 like the last I have my smoking and
129:00 stuff so that's why you see a lot of my
129:01 clothes over and over and over again
129:02 over five years because these are the
129:04 jackets that I hang up that are just so
129:05 smokey take my other jackets out for
129:07 dinner you won't see any season one on
129:10 this channel because I've remastered
129:11 them all balance the audio took out all
129:13 the custom music which
129:15 music industry was doing to screw me
129:16 over but there was a lot of censorship
129:18 so it's all on its own channel no ads
129:20 whatsoever you can also find them all a
129:23 bit shoot in case you just want to give
129:25 them the traffic but what's amazing is
129:29 is that the most popular videos on [ __ ]
129:31 shoot or almost the opposite of the most
129:35 popular videos on YouTube which I find
129:36 utterly amazing so I mean you know my
129:40 video and ego which is a real esoteric
129:43 thing about you know checking yourself
129:45 it's like third in line almost nobody
129:48 ever watches it on YouTube it's
129:49 hilarious right so that's pretty cool
129:52 but anyway take care of yourself and
129:55 someone else and I will see you in the
129:56 next deep thoughts over now
