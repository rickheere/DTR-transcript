00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts as you can see today we're
00:35 gonna take on something that's been on
00:36 my list for a long time and there's
00:40 about about once a year someone mentions
00:42 it and says hey man once you do this
00:44 episode and it's the Philadelphia
00:48 Experiment which quite technically is
00:52 Philadelphia experiments now I grew up
00:56 in the 80s and one of the greatest films
00:58 ever made during the 80s was the
01:00 Philadelphia Experiment and it's one of
01:04 those situations where when you're young
01:07 we didn't have the Internet
01:10 you will see a story like I I've got an
01:13 unpublished episode that I think talks
01:15 about well I know it talks about King
01:16 Arthur but you'll see these things and
01:20 no one around you say that that didn't
01:23 really happen just so you know so goes
01:27 into the mythos of your mind and you
01:29 know it's about an experiment two
01:32 experiments in 1943 have never been done
01:36 since but because our technology has
01:39 advanced so much since then you know
01:43 we're talking 80 years roughly just shy
01:45 of three years to 77 years today we can
01:50 kind of sort of imagine how this could
01:51 take place we could imagine it but this
01:56 one's a doozy in terms of all of the the
02:04 details of it
02:05 so essentially what took place was that
02:09 there was this Canon class ship called
02:12 the Eldridge was a 500 foot long ship
02:15 9,000 pound ship being built in the
02:19 Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and it was
02:23 supposed to be a ship that was intended
02:27 to have some special technology attached
02:30 to it to try and experiment with
02:32 avoiding
02:34 mine's from the Germans which were all
02:37 electromagnetically designed such that
02:42 you drive a ship hull by a mine and it
02:46 senses the magnitude through
02:48 electromagnetic field disturbance a lot
02:50 like an antenna on your telephone by
02:53 creating a pole around it and then if it
02:55 senses something big enough it'll latch
02:58 onto it using electromagnetism and then
03:01 of course explode and kill everybody on
03:04 board or a bunch of people but most the
03:06 time the ship sinks and so the only
03:08 people survive or potentially the
03:11 fraction that can get on to some sort of
03:13 rescue vessel so the the experiment
03:18 happens in two different days July 22nd
03:22 1943 in October 28th 1943 so you have
03:29 one experiment that and I have to say in
03:31 doing the research for this and trying
03:33 to you know gather up all of the rumors
03:37 about this thing the different pockets
03:40 of folks that are done some amazing
03:42 videos it's amazing articles they're
03:44 missing each other stuff some of them
03:47 kind of transpose dates and get stuff
03:49 that was supposed to have happened in
03:51 the July timeframe mixed up with the
03:54 October time frame in July of 22 July
03:58 22nd excuse me at 43 you have this
04:02 initial experiment and it sounds like
04:06 this was this ship was under
04:08 construction but it wasn't it was
04:10 already in full existence but that the
04:14 ship had a bunch of electromagnetic
04:20 wiring attached to it and of course
04:21 every wire has electromagnetic pull
04:23 around it but this was designed to be
04:25 very intense okay I'm gonna give you
04:29 sort of the official story of the
04:31 conspiracy and then we'll kind of parse
04:33 through how this story came to us right
04:37 because that's very powerful in the
04:40 equation but they said that the ship had
04:46 disappeared
04:48 from the dock after they turn on these
04:51 giant generators when they had the ship
04:53 kind of hooked to all these wires now
04:54 they don't really talk about exactly how
04:57 the wires were attached to the ship
05:00 later on in the story when we talk about
05:02 a guy that said he worked on the
05:05 experiment that they actually did we'll
05:07 get to that as far as the conspiracy
05:09 they don't really get to how it worked
05:11 out but the ship disappeared now this is
05:15 where the evidence pool kind of shifts
05:18 around a little bit one of the only
05:20 there's only one group that said that in
05:23 the 19's area the July 22nd experiment
05:26 that the ship actually showed up in
05:27 Newark and then showed up back in the
05:30 port in Philadelphia another person said
05:34 they said it showed up somewhere else in
05:36 the in the general vicinity not too far
05:39 away and it was observed by some folks
05:41 on a ship and then in September or sorry
05:46 October excuse me
05:47 there's so many dates in this one too
05:49 and October was very very specific it
05:53 left the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and
05:57 went to Norfolk Virginia which was north
05:59 technically 300 miles now should be
06:04 noted that there is a junction of River
06:07 that actually attached the Naval
06:09 Shipyard to Virginia and that the
06:11 Eldridge which is the ship had
06:14 permission to use the water but no one
06:15 else didn't and when using those waters
06:18 you were able to travel to Norfolk
06:21 Virginia from Philadelphia in six hours
06:24 - technically speaking the ship could
06:27 have driven to Norfolk Virginia done
06:30 something and turned around well within
06:32 a day right because maybe people are up
06:36 at the crack of dawn and they work until
06:38 the crack of night but the idea was that
06:43 this naval science Brigade out of the
06:49 I'm using all horrible terms but inside
06:51 this Philadelphia Naval Shipyard was
06:54 sort of like a wright-patterson Air
06:55 Force Base today where that's where all
06:58 of the skunkworks stuff gets created for
07:00 the government now skunk
07:01 works is actually a term that was coined
07:02 by a contractor but this is sort of what
07:05 we use as the BIC witness term for
07:07 covert projects the other piece of
07:10 information that's important to remember
07:11 is that the Manhattan Project is going
07:14 on at the same time and even though
07:16 that's centered in Tennessee and New
07:18 Mexico Tennessee being the facility
07:21 where they actually built that building
07:22 that you've seen that the refinement of
07:26 uranium into plutonium was actually
07:29 occurring in several different locations
07:30 and one of the things that they were
07:32 trying to do was get a reactor developed
07:35 using fission to put on ships so they
07:39 wouldn't have any necessity for fuel
07:41 necessarily would be a backup it's like
07:43 a hybrid car today so that was also I
07:46 believe d classed as being one of the
07:49 experiments in the area now of course if
07:52 you are a very devout Philadelphia
07:55 Experiment conspiracy theorist then you
07:59 know I understand your propensity to say
08:03 anything that negates the official story
08:06 is one of these situations where the
08:08 government is simply trying to cover its
08:09 tracks
08:10 but there is a lot of other evidence
08:12 that will start coming out so the idea
08:16 is how did this thing get out
08:18 does Philadelphia Experiment well you
08:22 have to go back to the experiments
08:24 because in July 22nd the only thing that
08:27 was said to have occurred was it the
08:29 ship with all of its occupants on the
08:32 ship travelled somewhere else but most
08:35 people have it only one source said they
08:37 thought they saw it in New York
08:39 now what's interesting is when they
08:41 conducted the experiment later on in the
08:43 year in October 22nd the ship was
08:46 recorded as being in Brooklyn New York
08:50 now I have again different stories some
08:53 some say that Brooklyn New York
08:56 docking which is in it ship logs and
08:59 supposedly where sailors got on and off
09:01 the ship is recorded by several people
09:04 that were involved and just being on the
09:06 ship but of course one could say just
09:09 like the Titanic switch the only thing
09:11 that that proves that it was the Titanic
09:13 versus the other one is
09:15 that um so he was like the Olympic or
09:17 something that was the blueprints with
09:20 the name across the top you know very
09:22 easy to forge that back into the
09:24 official story we will cover the Titanic
09:27 at some point and switch so what
09:30 supposedly took place because in the
09:34 October one and the 28th they said that
09:38 they turn this thing on and that the
09:40 ship glowed a green and blue and that it
09:45 disappeared and came back and when he
09:49 came back you had all kinds of weird
09:50 stuff going on but the main factor was
09:55 that the sailors that were on the ship
09:56 were supposedly in a sort of a chaotic
10:02 state where some people were in the hole
10:04 some people had tried to I guess run
10:08 into their hands were through the wall
10:10 some people's bodies were just
10:12 completely exploded all over the ground
10:14 and this was all supposedly using a
10:19 never proven even to 20/20 unified field
10:23 theory that our buddy
10:24 Albert Einstein who might be able to
10:28 find his navel supposedly came up with
10:31 but I'm getting a little bit ahead of
10:33 myself so we have this sort of in order
10:39 for the for the story to get to us we
10:42 have three people three groups I should
10:44 say two people in one group one being
10:46 the Navy all coming together and
10:48 colliding to birth this thing into the
10:51 modern culture there was a guy named
10:55 Morris K Jessup who was a sort of a
10:59 aspiring sci-fi writer and he was also
11:02 by profession an astronomer he had a
11:04 master's degree in astronomy apparently
11:08 he was going for his ph.d but then
11:10 ceased to do that and he had written a
11:14 book called the case for UFOs and it
11:18 what's interesting is there's a lot of
11:20 folks that study the the facts of
11:22 Philadelphia experiment seemed to miss
11:24 out on the true narrative of his book
11:29 his book was asserting that you know the
11:35 government and having all control over
11:38 media and having the need to develop
11:42 technology that can be covert could sort
11:46 of do what we've been talking about with
11:47 the fake alien invasion they can create
11:49 any type of narrative to freak out the
11:51 public and because they supply all the
11:54 information to you they can control us
12:00 now in addition he also he had access to
12:04 one of the biggest refracting telescopes
12:06 in the United States and so he and a
12:08 buddy were really punching into space
12:11 and seeing you know double stars and a
12:14 bunch of stuff that we hadn't seen
12:16 before and so he was really kind of
12:17 pioneering within his astronomy world
12:20 but he wrote this book and he publishes
12:24 it now that book did really really well
12:27 and as he continued to try and come up
12:30 with a sequel some sort of follow a book
12:32 on a different subject let's just say it
12:36 never did really that that well that was
12:38 his big one-hit wonder which is fine he
12:41 did really well but he started to have
12:47 you know marital issues and then ends up
12:52 taking his own life and we're gonna get
12:54 to loop around a little bit so you don't
12:56 get completely bored with a linear
12:57 explanation of all things but the Navy
13:01 was sent a book that had a bunch of
13:06 inscriptions in of his book meanwhile on
13:09 the outside he's getting up to 50
13:12 letters from this guy claiming to be
13:16 Carlos Miguel Alan Alan de Il yonder al
13:24 e in de and the guy is starting to tell
13:28 him about this experiment that he saw in
13:31 October 28th 43 the way he tells the
13:35 story is that he witnessed this
13:36 Bluegreen glow and then he said he
13:39 touched the ship
13:40 it gets funny right and have you ever
13:43 been to a shipping yard before you have
13:46 any idea how far away the dock is from
13:48 the hole it's uh it's quite a distance
13:50 right and so he just went hmm you know
13:53 you got like a 40-foot arm so him saying
13:57 he touched the ship was hilarious but
13:59 then he got shocked by it and that this
14:04 is this is the according to this Carlos
14:07 guy whose real name is Carl Allen he's
14:10 using some weird pseudonym he goes on to
14:14 tell Jessup and letters that Albert
14:17 Einstein was on a ship in the bay
14:21 obviously there to watch this unified
14:24 field theory work out because he had
14:27 experienced this this uncomfortable
14:31 experience touching the whole of the
14:32 ship during the experiment but Albert
14:34 Einstein invited him over and they
14:38 became friends and then he started
14:42 mentoring this Allen guy about the
14:46 unified field theory something that I'm
14:49 Stan was supposedly working on last ten
14:51 years of his life and again it's never
14:52 been proven ever and the unified field
14:55 theory is essentially a theory that
14:57 describes gravity and electromagnetism
14:59 as separate fields separate properties
15:05 in space-time and that he was going to
15:07 try to bring it all together now if you
15:11 just watch my episodes there's no need
15:13 for that theory because ether keeps them
15:16 unified the entire time which is nice
15:19 but now this Carl Allen guy is he's a
15:24 crafty little character he was in the
15:27 Navy he went in in 43 so he would have
15:31 been in the Navy they said and generally
15:33 his naval services were very standard
15:35 nothing bad but nothing tremendous about
15:38 his experiences with in a way he wasn't
15:41 a hero or anything which is kind of odd
15:43 because that's definitely a time when
15:44 you could have could have done such a
15:48 thing the Atlantic Pacific are the
15:50 Atlantic Rim Atlantic Ocean
15:53 fighting with
15:54 the Germans was the longest naval battle
15:58 up to that point in world history it may
16:01 still because I don't think we've had
16:02 any real naval fighting so the Pacific
16:04 Rim fighting paled in comparison what
16:07 was going on in the Atlantic so the
16:08 imperative to create a ship that could
16:10 get past u-boats and electromagnetic
16:13 mines was pretty high on the list but to
16:16 give you really quick before you invest
16:20 too much in this Carl Allen guy / his
16:23 own notes to Jessup he claimed to have
16:29 met Steinmetz you hear me mention
16:31 Steinmetz a lot miss Tyne Metz was a
16:34 they they miss categorize this guy quite
16:38 a bit
16:39 Steinmetz is often miss categorized as
16:42 having dwarfism I if you look at the
16:44 skeletal scans of his body what he had
16:47 was massive scoliosis / almost a
16:50 survived spinal meningitis sort of thing
16:52 his spine did a huge s-curve so went up
16:55 went directly to the right or left and
16:58 then right back up again so he lost a
16:59 lot of his height due to the fact that
17:01 his spine was doing a big snake turn and
17:03 it is the most acute turn I've ever seen
17:07 in someone's spine in my life so that's
17:09 how bad Steinman's was but he said he
17:12 Mets they said the Einstein introduced
17:14 him to Steinmetz problem
17:17 Steinmetz died in 1923 before Carl Allen
17:21 was ever born so right there you have a
17:24 bold-faced lie in his materials to Jessa
17:27 and given that that was not a critical
17:31 point in a believed any of his claimed
17:33 understanding of this conspiracy of this
17:36 experiment it was something that was
17:39 just all a cart because he didn't have
17:40 the internet to figure out that these
17:42 people were dead so Carl Allen is D
17:46 legitimized quite a bit right from the
17:48 very beginning if you're paying
17:49 attention but then this book is sent
17:53 Jessup's book is sent at the navy with
17:55 all of this inscription all in the
17:58 borders of the book and it is also
18:02 attempting this is the way it's always
18:05 described it's attempting to
18:07 have three different handwriting's the
18:12 insinuation because I haven't read the
18:15 read the materials is that you know he's
18:19 talking about all kinds of things time
18:21 travel and aliens and and this
18:23 Philadelphia Experiment is largely in
18:25 there then we're gonna loop back on some
18:28 of what was asserted by Carl of course
18:30 it's probably all science fiction but
18:33 it's still very entertaining but he
18:36 tried to make two of them human and then
18:38 he tried to make the third hand writing
18:39 alien and I've seen it I've seen the
18:43 writing and it's very human cursive so
18:46 fascinating that that would be the case
18:49 so the Navy is obviously looking at this
18:52 trying to decipher it and they've just
18:55 said okay let's just go to Jessup and
18:56 see if he knows what this is so he
18:58 brings the book to Jessup or the Navy
19:01 brings it to Jessup and goes he got this
19:03 word book it's got a bunch of stuff in
19:04 it I thought maybe you would know
19:06 something about this
19:09 so Jessup was looking at this thing and
19:11 he's like you know this handwriting
19:15 looks really familiar and he makes the
19:18 correlation with the 50 letters that
19:20 this Karlos a yonder a yonder whatever
19:24 sent him which is Carl Allen okay and so
19:31 they start piecing this together
19:33 Carl starts to get in direct
19:35 communication with Jessup as you know
19:37 outside of the letters I believe and by
19:41 the late 50s Jessup it pretty much said
19:45 you know this this Carl guy is
19:46 completely clinically insane his story
19:50 changes he's just grasping he doesn't
19:53 have the full complete story of anything
19:55 he just sort of has the highlights you
19:57 know it's it's almost like someone using
19:59 fanciful words to to impress you without
20:03 any content something like Einstein
20:05 doesn't it so in Jessup's personal life
20:11 he had I'm not sure why this was the
20:15 case but I guess astronomy didn't pay a
20:16 lot of money and so he
20:20 his wife left him in 58 and that's sort
20:24 of like his information that we don't
20:25 really need to know but that led him to
20:27 be very suicidal and they the conspiracy
20:31 theorists don't tell you about his life
20:34 prior to his suicide they just say he
20:36 mysteriously died they don't even tell
20:38 you how he died so the way that he died
20:40 the Morris Jessup guy the astronomer
20:43 sci-fi writer was it he got in his car
20:47 and he did the hose from the exhaust
20:48 into the cabin and it's fixated tight
20:54 well when the authorities had to do the
20:57 police report and did some investigation
20:58 asked his friends they said yeah you
21:00 know what the guy had been talking about
21:01 killing himself for months before he did
21:05 it so we're not terribly surprised his
21:08 wife left him and you know it's just it
21:11 was a devastating part of his life right
21:13 he died on August 20th 1959 so now one
21:20 of the interesting things were the the
21:22 conspiracy sort of rebounds a little bit
21:28 okay so you have this claim that this
21:30 ship disappeared back in July 22nd and
21:33 then in October 28th but do you have
21:38 supposedly some eyewitnesses that said
21:42 that the men that supposedly served on
21:44 the boat came home and they were all
21:47 experiencing super random things one of
21:52 the most common things that they said
21:54 some of the sailors had was that they
21:56 would be walking around perfectly fine
21:59 and then pause and just sit there for a
22:02 really long time and then start back up
22:03 again one family supposedly again so
22:08 that their family member walked into a
22:10 wall and just disappeared the biggest
22:13 one that was supposedly printed in a
22:16 newspaper however they cannot find the
22:18 original newspaper this was printed in
22:20 but it was printed on newspaper and
22:22 someone clipped it out of the newspaper
22:25 and handed it over I guess to whoever's
22:28 paying attention to this story and said
22:30 that there was a brawl between two of
22:33 the
22:34 that had both been on the ship in
22:36 October and that in the middle of this
22:39 fistfight
22:39 they both vanished spontaneous
22:43 combustion was also the result of
22:45 supposedly the how some of these men met
22:47 there and they just vaporized and what's
22:51 interesting about the whole thing for me
22:53 is that this is some of the best sci-fi
22:56 ever if this is truly faked because this
23:00 is sort of like advanced thinking from
23:03 our time about what could take place and
23:05 I again I've listened to you I believe
23:08 every two thousand-plus
23:09 episode off the 50s radio in the early
23:12 50s
23:12 I've definitely listen to every X minus
23:15 one I can get my hand on and these are
23:17 science fiction badasses right Asimov
23:21 Ray Bradbury Heinlein all wrote for X
23:24 minus one I think even philip k dick
23:26 wrote one for X minus one so talking
23:28 about the most brilliant writers on
23:30 planet earth and they they've never
23:32 asserted a story with any of these sorts
23:35 of anomalies to the human body so I find
23:39 that fascinating it's just it was so you
23:41 know the Carl guy if he's truly what
23:44 we're going to end on which is most
23:47 people thinking he's crazy and of course
23:48 hey we know plenty of people that
23:50 understood 9/11 and they say that those
23:53 people are crazy too I think quite
23:57 frankly one of the weapons that they
24:00 could use against you and I think
24:01 Woodrow Wilson may have gotten a little
24:03 bit of this although he may have died a
24:04 dementia Howard Hughes I believe might
24:07 have been poisoned is that there's just
24:09 some mercury you can put in people's
24:11 drinks and stuff and they're consuming
24:13 at all and then of course the my
24:15 deteriorates and they can just say oh
24:17 well see he was a crackpot you know
24:20 Howard Hughes was in the way of the big
24:23 giant aviation companies preparing to
24:26 swallow up the world right and so they
24:29 needed him out of the way cuz he was
24:30 such a maverick they just weren't allow
24:31 him to be there of course he gets
24:33 legitimately crazy he saves all of his
24:36 pee and jars saves those fingernails and
24:38 jars gross his hair out really long and
24:40 so he definitely struggled mentally at
24:43 the end now whether or not
24:45 he struggled because it was natural or
24:47 because they just slowly poisoned the
24:49 guy don't know if you use arsenic the
24:52 body starts to have bloody bleeding and
24:55 hemorrhaging so you don't want to use
24:57 something that's easy to track in the
24:58 blood line but mercury I mean Jesus it
25:01 was a cure back in the 40s and 50s it
25:04 was insanity right now during the
25:07 october experiment you know and what's
25:11 interesting about is that carl never
25:13 claimed to be on the ship when it did
25:15 its thing and so him contributing
25:20 information about these journeys i'm not
25:23 sure where these claims come from
25:26 because I'm hearing the claims and I'm
25:28 not hearing the sources in many of the
25:31 cases just they said people claim people
25:33 claim people claim but one of the things
25:35 which I think is interesting because if
25:37 you think about the DMT drops that
25:40 people have a very good friend of mine
25:41 brilliant dude I've talked about his
25:44 journey several times he said that once
25:48 you take DMT you get met by pretty much
25:51 a grey alien and that is your guide for
25:54 the rest of your life almost like a
25:56 spirit animal in the Native American
25:57 world every time he dropped after that
26:00 he had that same character until his
26:03 last trip I don't know how many trips
26:05 this guy took but he said the last trip
26:07 the dude was pissed that he took another
26:09 trip and he put his forehead against his
26:11 forehead so there's great against his
26:13 fort he said those eyeballs are riding
26:14 in my eyeballs and the journey was
26:19 happening he's physically going through
26:20 the universe like he normally does on
26:22 DMT but this dude was like right on him
26:24 and saying you should be here you need
26:27 to stop coming here this is our world
26:29 you stay in your world will stay in our
26:31 world you know and my buddy who's hardly
26:34 a an impressionable guy a weak-minded
26:38 guy he his words to me were I never
26:45 wanted to be home more in my life was a
26:47 good-looking guy rich of [ __ ] I mean he
26:50 just he's a baller in his own world so
26:52 it'd be like it'd be like my buddy isn't
26:55 as big as a wrestler but I would say it
26:57 would be like the rock
26:58 telling you that story like really you
27:01 you were freaked out it was like yeah so
27:04 it what they said was that when this
27:06 ship did its journey from Philadelphia
27:11 to Norfolk Virginia that along the way
27:14 aliens were there to to guide them
27:17 through this sort of portal it
27:19 supposedly opens up so Jessup takes his
27:23 own life in 59
27:24 but this Carl dude who stopped using the
27:28 the Carlos thing he ends up sort of
27:33 becoming one of those famous circuit
27:35 speakers you know like the what is it
27:37 Project Camelot folks and those UFO
27:39 facade societies where people go up and
27:41 speak and you could make a lot of money
27:42 as long as you can tell the story to
27:43 keep it keep it sound and like bob lazar
27:47 he could make a ton of money if he just
27:50 run around telling the story and keep it
27:51 straight but i have to say like every
27:53 time bob escapes an interview without
27:55 people asking him for the evidence that
27:57 he went to both MIT and Caltech and
27:59 produced photographic proof for dos an
28:02 alumni a piece of paraphernalia from the
28:06 era explain how his parents never you
28:11 know his parents and his relatives and
28:14 his best friends should all be going
28:16 yeah it's my genius buddy you went to
28:17 two different top tech colleges on
28:21 planet earth with in I guess a few years
28:24 ray cut his duct PhD in both whatever
28:28 but every time that dude escapes I'm
28:30 sure he's just thinking his lucky stars
28:31 and no one asked him the right questions
28:34 but the Carl guy was said to have
28:37 evolved his story over time and they
28:41 didn't really give any details about how
28:44 he varied his story but it seemed like
28:47 if from the sort of notes that I got off
28:52 of so many different sources that if it
28:54 appealed to the audience it suddenly
28:56 would become real and so if aliens was a
29:02 it was something that they wanted he
29:05 would just simply write it into his next
29:06 speech and then aliens were all sudden a
29:08 part of the Philadelphia Experiment
29:11 and you should know that when he died in
29:13 1994 the last year of his life he
29:18 confessed that the whole thing was made
29:20 up he was all in his head that there
29:24 wasn't a electromagnetic piece of
29:27 technology it's called electro field
29:29 manipulation that was actually put on
29:31 the ship which we're gonna get to next
29:33 year and that's legit but this whole
29:35 disappearing thing the truesight
29:38 disappearing and teleportation and all
29:39 that kind of stuff was all fraudulent
29:42 now the second that he said this
29:45 everyone dropped him like a hot potato
29:47 and so he became extremely isolated in
29:50 that last year and so he flip-flopped
29:52 his story back to the original story
29:54 which had evolved quite a bit since he
29:57 first wrote it in the Jessup's book but
30:00 now story isn't in there I'm gonna stay
30:04 on the conspiracy part for just one more
30:06 segment here I believe the gentleman's
30:10 name is al dungeon or Duncan there's
30:13 something like that when I believe it's
30:16 84 so when the movie came out with
30:19 Philadelphia Experiment which if you
30:21 haven't seen the movie it is just a it's
30:24 a beautiful Twilight Zone is what it is
30:26 it's cast well it's got a great budget
30:29 it was just fantastic film so you should
30:31 definitely go see if you haven't seen it
30:34 but this dude is watching the movie and
30:40 says that he had these memories of these
30:46 repressed memories of being on the ship
30:49 no this is work it's so fascinating and
30:53 it's not fascinating for the
30:54 Philadelphia Experiment issue it's
30:56 fascinating how the human mind works and
30:58 how either someone okay so I mean
31:03 there's a slight chance that this guy
31:04 would be telling the truth with what I'm
31:05 about to tell you but it gets outrageous
31:07 like from bullet one okay so either
31:10 someone sitting in their living room
31:12 thinking oh my god I can come up with a
31:14 great story about me being on this ship
31:16 or the person's like wow I am clinically
31:20 insane but I'm a genius insane and I'm
31:22 entertaining ly insane
31:24 and so I'm going to hatch this new story
31:27 so he says that he has all these
31:31 memories being on the ship I think the
31:35 problem was is that he wasn't old enough
31:36 to be on the ship I can I'm sure he was
31:39 born by the time he saw them or by the
31:41 time the 1943 thing happened so his
31:45 story adjustment from the very very
31:46 beginning was that he was actually in
31:48 someone else's body and that you know it
31:53 was like a previous life recollection of
31:55 the whole thing he says that he jumped
31:59 off the ship with another guy and that
32:03 they found themselves in a hospital with
32:07 radiation burns in the year 21:37 but he
32:12 was part of a project called Montauk
32:14 which is like a time-traveling sort of
32:18 project when these things vary
32:19 coast-to-coast he said when they jumped
32:22 out of the ship it wasn't like they
32:24 jumped into the water and ended up in
32:26 the hospital that they jumped out of the
32:27 ship it ended up in the clouds and then
32:30 they kind of walked through the clouds I
32:32 mean he he what's fascinating is he's
32:34 got a brilliant concept to go with but
32:37 then he just keeps - pure outrageous
32:40 wild imagery right I mean it's it's the
32:43 guy making this up should have been or
32:45 at least telling this story should have
32:49 been a sci-fi writer because he's really
32:50 coming up with an interesting imagery
32:52 that might have been too goofy for
32:55 today's theaters but back in the 80s I
32:58 think we would have swallowed up if you
32:59 just shot the film and stylized it
33:01 correctly right but now here's what's
33:04 interesting because this guy is telling
33:05 the story in the mid-eighties and I
33:09 don't know if he was a huge sci-fi buff
33:11 and I haven't read even remotely a lot
33:15 of sci-fi so maybe he's poaching it from
33:18 other books now for those of you a big
33:20 sci-fi book readers perk up your ears
33:22 for a second and take notes was there a
33:25 book before 1985 that suggested that the
33:29 world would be eventually run by a
33:32 computer
33:34 now teach x11 3-8 has a bit of that and
33:37 that's early 70s so I'm sure this
33:40 thing's out there but what he said was
33:41 eventually and he doesn't say exactly
33:45 how because he said from 20 to 21 37 he
33:49 actually went back to 1983 where he
33:52 comes from must have been 83 or
33:53 something like that and then maybe he's
33:56 living his life now is this new guy but
34:00 he said he eventually went to the 20th
34:02 century no real explanation of how this
34:04 happens besides to say he was part of
34:06 this project Montauk now get this
34:09 that take part this is fun and then part
34:11 of this is sort of what we talk about
34:12 today because the Georgia Guidestones
34:15 were built in I believe 80 81 he said
34:19 the world was run by a computer and that
34:24 there were only 300 million people on
34:25 earth hmm remember the Guidestones say
34:30 in the first commandment that it'll be
34:32 500 million or less in perpetual balance
34:36 with nature and I keep telling you
34:38 they're never gonna go to 500 million
34:39 because that's that's right at the
34:42 maximum and you wouldn't do that you'd
34:44 start way below and then build up and
34:46 kind of hover probably way away from the
34:48 maximum right actually I got that guy's
34:51 name wrong I apologize the al guys name
34:54 of the person I just talked about his
34:57 last names by law by lack I apologize
35:01 the last thing he said that he expected
35:04 that he studied he saw was being in the
35:06 year 60 37 he loves thirty-sevens 21 37
35:10 and 60 37 now haven't been an employee
35:14 and good friend of Syd Mead my whole
35:16 life as I've told you several times on
35:19 the show man's ability to see into the
35:21 future which Syd was probably one of the
35:24 best and most talented to ever live on
35:26 planet earth hence his career was that
35:30 man can only really conceive about 300
35:32 years in the future after 300 years the
35:35 entire technological base of what man's
35:38 life is is constructed of completely
35:41 changes now you know I'm not sure if
35:45 that's exactly true because
35:47 let's say I were to take you back to
35:49 Rome you could be in Rome and be in
35:53 their world but maybe what's its whole
35:56 thing is the polarity is simply going
35:57 forward people in Rome couldn't conceive
35:59 easily what we're doing but I have my
36:02 doubts you know someone in was it Pompey
36:05 could you come to my house and go okay I
36:07 see you've got a lot of construction
36:08 techniques we don't have but you know
36:10 why your [ __ ] sucks because you should
36:13 see the cement we pour in Rome and you
36:15 know you show them a TV a computer and
36:17 other car and they're gonna obviously
36:19 freak out but that where they couldn't
36:22 conceive of certain items that can
36:23 definitely conceive of the basics so
36:25 perhaps you know this is this is
36:27 claiming a 4000 year jump huge now I
36:32 don't think he provided many details
36:33 about his 60-37 journey just like most
36:37 people and coast to coast you know I
36:41 have an issue as well but hey I forgot
36:46 the guy who did it but someone took the
36:48 book with all of the writing transposed
36:53 it to be easily readable and distributed
36:56 it to over a hundred people and said you
36:59 know if you know anything about this
37:01 could you give me a call old sailors old
37:04 commanders old scientists get you give
37:06 me a call and you got one call from this
37:09 dungeon guy who's first names Edward
37:12 so it's al by lack and he's the time
37:16 traveler probably hoaxster and then the
37:19 Edward dungeon guy who was actually a
37:21 legit sailor at the time stationed in
37:25 the Philadelphia shipyard so I told you
37:28 about those mines right you've seen him
37:30 a hundred times the movie top secret at
37:34 a absolutely hilarious sequence with a
37:38 Jewish scientist that was stuck in the
37:41 basement reading a mind that had a big
37:46 horseshoe magnet on it at some point it
37:49 activated and a u-boat from like you
37:52 know hundreds of miles awake and jamming
37:54 through the wall and stuck to the mine
37:57 but these Germans had created this it
38:00 looks like the virus right so it's a
38:01 ball with these little pointy things all
38:03 around it you guys
38:04 most men over 40 have definitely seen
38:06 one but you know about these things
38:09 they're magnetic they attract to steal
38:14 of course and they just blow you up okay
38:17 so the Navy were running into these
38:22 mines and it was blowing up a bunch of
38:26 ships and killing a bunch of sailors and
38:27 really ganc in the war and general
38:30 attorney in this what were two thing so
38:33 they're intense quite ingeniously was to
38:36 say okay what if we can create a
38:44 electromagnetic field around the ship
38:46 such that either the mine can't sense us
38:50 because the poles bump into each other
38:52 and return 100% back to their sensors
38:54 all right so it's emitting the pull and
38:57 as it comes back in full strength it's
39:00 not gonna feel anything but it's also
39:02 not gonna do the magnetic interlacing
39:06 with the lead or the steel hull of the
39:09 ship and pull itself up right and so
39:12 you're basically repelling the field
39:15 so this redundant guy said look what we
39:18 were doing is we wrapped the entire hull
39:21 of the Eldridge in these gigantic cables
39:24 and then we just simply turn the thing
39:27 on and from what we understand the
39:31 experiment was fairly successful in just
39:35 being able to drive by a mine and so
39:39 you're probably going well we don't see
39:41 ships today with these wires all around
39:43 the hole well I'm not sure exactly what
39:47 they ended up doing with the technology
39:49 but I can tell you that once you find
39:50 out that experiments works which they
39:52 could have conducted obviously in a room
39:54 as well you could integrate it into the
39:58 hole in several different ways
40:01 several different ways so I'm not sure
40:04 how much of the of the mind technology
40:06 we even have to worry about today so we
40:09 probably just abandon the
40:11 thing but you have to remember 1944
40:14 you know you've got a lot of amazing
40:16 technology going on that's when they the
40:19 Germans supposedly had finished building
40:21 their first stealth bomber now as far as
40:24 I understand it was never flown but
40:26 you've probably seen the maybe it hasn't
40:31 been flown but I don't think it needed
40:32 any bombing runs but who knows right but
40:37 it's what the was that the the b-2
40:41 bomber looks like just swept back wing
40:44 configuration right so I heard about
40:48 this you know the Alan by lack claims of
40:52 being a part of the project Montauk
41:00 which is Bill MO and tau K project
41:03 Montauk Air Force Base in New York is
41:06 where this project was supposedly
41:09 hatched now it is my understanding that
41:13 what they described because we know
41:15 about the Roswell 47 crash which again
41:18 seems super legit to me and I can't even
41:21 believe I'm admitting that you know
41:25 again I sequestered myself this is your
41:27 first time seeing the show i sequestered
41:29 myself only to eyewitnesses of the crash
41:31 and the relatives and best friends of
41:33 those that were part of the township as
41:36 well as employees of the actual base
41:38 nothing off of any sci-fi channel any
41:42 that crap all off
41:43 eyewitness testimony on camera at one
41:46 guy testifying the same story over 30
41:48 years all the while you know the distant
41:52 foe keeps saying that he was changing
41:53 his story constantly right but the
41:56 montauk experiment was supposedly the
42:00 result of the fact that the Philadelphia
42:02 Experiment ripped a hole in space-time
42:05 thus letting in the aliens as an
42:09 interdimensional travel system and so
42:12 their whole thing was that they were
42:14 doing mind control and time-travel stuff
42:16 and sort of managing the byproduct of
42:22 the Philadelphia Experiment
42:24 and I had never heard of this beforehand
42:27 but guy named Preston Nichols was the
42:30 first guy to write the book about
42:31 Project Montauk and then it sort of laid
42:36 low until another dude Jacques Vallee
42:41 jumped on it who supposedly has a
42:43 degrees in her psychology psychology and
42:48 electrical engineering okay
42:50 and he doesn't start saying anything
42:53 until the 80s now you know you start and
42:58 he you know we was talking about people
43:02 being abducted but one of the other
43:05 things that they said that they were
43:06 working on in the project Montague was
43:08 teleportation now what's fascinating is
43:11 is that the subject of teleportation
43:16 mind control and time travel has become
43:18 a big item in the 21st century
43:21 and the kind of the way I see it is
43:24 there's a bit of a pattern in the world
43:27 and you know when I talk about the story
43:32 of Christ for instance most Christians
43:35 have no knowledge that the story of
43:38 Christ had been told so many times
43:40 before two dozen times minimum before
43:42 Christ ever existed a virgin birth
43:45 hieroglyphs virgin birth Queen Semiramis
43:48 Nimrod teh Moses Jesus and so who Colin
43:54 all these different deities and and
43:57 demigods being born always a virgin
43:59 birth you know this story had been
44:01 around forever and so it seems that when
44:07 either there needs to be a
44:09 disinformation campaign by a government
44:11 or just individuals trying to come up
44:14 with the next you know into the world
44:16 2012 story they'll reach into a bucket
44:19 because they keep these books their dues
44:21 iasts about these sort of conspiracies
44:25 that have been developed by a man over
44:27 time and they always seem to have a
44:32 certain period of time that is
44:35 intelligently kept between the retelling
44:38 the story any serious way there's always
44:40 someone saying a particular conspiracy
44:42 we know that for a fact
44:43 but in terms of a publisher getting
44:46 involved in sort of that new-age section
44:48 in the bookstore now we don't need to
44:51 publish books it can just be called you
44:53 know Q and ons project looking last sort
44:55 of stuff right so there are people that
44:59 are deride people and the people that
45:01 are very lucid in this world and so the
45:07 lucid can really really manipulate the
45:10 deride people but there's also a
45:12 customer to customer relation between
45:14 the lucid how many of you have ever been
45:16 in a long-distance relationship
45:19 teleportation is the first thing you
45:21 think of I mean whether or not you had
45:23 think about it in a star trekky sense or
45:25 you just think oh my god I suppose I
45:27 could be there right now she's in New
45:29 York and I'm in California and blah blah
45:30 blah blah you think about it
45:34 the other one is invisibility huge huge
45:38 I mean million things you could do if
45:40 you were invisible military definitely
45:43 wants invisibility he definitely would
45:45 love teleportation oh my god can you
45:47 imagine if anyone had this technology
45:50 none of the stuff you see in the world
45:52 would be going on it wouldn't want to
45:55 mess with us in the Middle East okay
45:56 we're teleporting in a gigantic army
45:58 with tanks indebted at a boom getting
46:01 there by the time your missiles launch
46:02 we're about we're out of there you know
46:04 now time-travel is we always talk about
46:07 on this particular show is just to recap
46:11 real quickly you know the big thing
46:14 about the project Looking Glass was a
46:16 bunch of hillbillies on line going me
46:17 you know time is not linear he's a
46:20 multi-dimensional well you know I so the
46:25 idea is okay but it is multi-dimensional
46:26 then wherever you're going is not where
46:28 we are so who cares stay over there when
46:30 you get there would you in order to
46:34 modify your timeline you have to stay in
46:35 your timeline it has to be a linear
46:37 traveling experience but they make this
46:40 big but they just want to sound
46:42 intelligent I guess they want to sound
46:44 mysterious and so they go after they
46:46 immediately negate their own conspiracy
46:48 right from the get-go not realizing that
46:50 they're opening mission state
46:52 and kills their entire purpose like
46:54 project looking-glass right it's like a
46:59 it's like a big tiger that eats the back
47:01 half of its own body and bleeds out in
47:03 two seconds and tries to prove how
47:05 ferocious he is T right
47:07 as far as teleportation goes I can say
47:11 one reason why it doesn't exist right
47:13 away if teleportation existed any leader
47:19 in the world I'll let you fill in the
47:20 blank that they want dead teleport in
47:24 the room you you're dead teleport out
47:27 hey if you got that kind of technology
47:29 any security cameras well there's an
47:31 electromagnetic field around you so the
47:33 photons never leave your body and go
47:35 anywhere you were a little belt buckle
47:37 or something from Batman's outfit and
47:39 security campus just basically see how
47:41 void into the room and this all could
47:44 happen in a split second why even send
47:46 human being when I said a robot because
47:47 [ __ ] while you're at it when I just
47:49 invented Robbie the robot in two seconds
47:51 time travel all right
47:55 haven't you ever like run into a
47:58 conspiracy where they made gigantic
48:00 mistakes how about the JFK assassination
48:03 how about the moon missions
48:05 how about 9/11 mistakes mistakes
48:08 mistakes all those massacres who go
48:11 around around the go around the world
48:13 you know they make gigantic mistakes
48:15 well there'd be no mistakes the most
48:17 powerful people in the world would have
48:18 time travel and if nothing else they
48:21 better look and get it alright and then
48:23 they come in here and they do it alright
48:24 doesn't exist it doesn't exist times at
48:27 a complete illusion for your mind
48:29 the only thing time exists because you
48:31 have a gift called the database and that
48:34 database facilitates state changes in
48:36 your mind well I was young once now I'm
48:38 older but hardcore listeners have heard
48:40 at all so Bill del phix written now a
48:46 lot of videos I saw ended with do you
48:48 think it's real that one I would love to
48:52 hear details that I'm missing that would
48:54 negate the cynicism that it's not real
48:57 Carl Allen is a very big problem for you
49:00 because again lying about hanging out
49:02 with Einstein and lying about
49:05 meeting Steinmetz is pretty bad
49:07 portfolio to start out with
49:08 by the way Einstein's whereabouts were
49:11 witnessed in this timeframe and he was
49:13 nowhere near Philadelphia at the time so
49:15 that in itself is [ __ ] but let's
49:18 just talk about for a split second here
49:19 I did an episode on conspiracies in
49:23 general but I don't know if I made this
49:25 point at all let alone clearly if I did
49:30 which is you know when conspiracies are
49:33 really entertaining there's something we
49:38 don't admit to and I think it's
49:40 fascinating part of it is like a magic
49:44 trick a conspiracies like a magic trick
49:47 when it's truly purely conspiratorial
49:49 and as no basis in reality you know we
49:53 have bad bad conspiracies that really
49:55 hurt people and so we don't want to mess
49:57 around with those but think about it
50:00 when you go see a magician what are some
50:04 of the principles by which you rep you
50:06 demand when you see a magician let's say
50:09 if you took your best bud yeah your BFF
50:11 for you ladies and you're watching a
50:14 stage magician like a big one in Vegas
50:18 or something and your friend is
50:20 constantly I know how that's done well
50:22 you know there's the mirror right there
50:22 and he's doing see how he palmed it
50:24 see how he's trying to just you would
50:26 smack that person in the face wouldn't
50:27 you you do not want someone to undo the
50:31 magic trick we all know it's not real
50:33 necessarily these guys are magicians but
50:36 we're looking for the illusion to be
50:38 done so beautifully that the mind
50:40 believes it and in that paradigm
50:43 everybody understands later at dinner or
50:48 later on the drive home you talk about
50:50 how you think things occurred but during
50:53 the experience you don't want to have
50:54 anyone mess with it well the
50:56 Philadelphia Experiment is such a
51:01 beautifully told story especially as the
51:03 movie represented the movie is so good
51:06 and you should know there's Twilight
51:08 zones and Xbox one episodes that are
51:11 very that have elements of the movie in
51:13 them which is one of the most similar
51:18 Twilight
51:18 I cannot remember the name of the
51:20 episode but it has to do with a pilot
51:23 that flew way up in the air and I think
51:25 it was during World War one and he had a
51:30 sudden acceleration on this point and a
51:33 light and all sudden flew and landed in
51:37 modern 1959 6061 Airport of a US Naval
51:43 Base our US Air Force Base excuse me and
51:46 you know pop said he's got an old plane
51:48 it's brand new he's got his outfit on
51:50 he's in the past and of course sees he's
51:52 like a British Air Force pilot and you
51:56 know they're asking him who he is what
51:57 his rank is and he's you know slowly
51:59 figuring out you know what year is it
52:01 you know and he finds out that um yeah
52:04 someone's got some explaining to do
52:06 right and eventually you know they don't
52:10 want to let him go but he's like look I
52:12 got to get up there again because the
52:13 Sun is doing that thing it did when I
52:15 got into this thing in the first place
52:16 the clouds are back or whatever and he
52:18 jumps to see Johnny escapes runs out to
52:20 the plane goes up so what they did with
52:23 the Philadelphia Experiment movie is
52:24 they do tell a story of a couple sailors
52:26 did are sent up to the present day which
52:30 I guess is 83 or so but here's the thing
52:33 here's my point sometimes you don't want
52:37 to hear that things aren't true because
52:39 in your mind you're still watching a
52:40 great magic trick and think about it as
52:45 long as you don't become delusional as a
52:48 result of hearing a fun conspiracy just
52:52 like you don't as an adult typically
52:56 exit a magic show and then tell your
52:58 friends magic is real and best you say
53:02 you say this dude was so good that it
53:10 made magic look real you know I've been
53:14 in the Magic Castle three times at least
53:16 I my old client Jeffrey Bornstein that
53:20 dude my gut he does this twisty money
53:23 thing where he's got a bunch of ones in
53:26 his hand and they're all folded up
53:27 nicely and then he's always talking
53:29 about how you wish you had more money
53:30 and just there's one point where just
53:32 the thing over he's got his hands these
53:34 palms out he's got no sleeves on he just
53:37 flips it over and it all becomes 20s and
53:39 he counts the whole thing out
53:41 he holds all the money out to your fate
53:43 and you just like hmm you know it's just
53:45 like he's so good
53:46 he's a great pickpocket too man I've got
53:49 video of him just pulling people around
53:52 in the crowd getting them set up for a
53:54 trick and he's got everyone's watch off
53:55 belts off while it's off I mean it's
53:57 just unbelievable helmet beautiful great
54:01 magic can be so part of me
54:05 okay with these sorts of conspiracy
54:08 discussions I have no desire whatsoever
54:12 even though I might you know have
54:15 debunked it in my own you know
54:17 dissertation about the subject I don't
54:20 have any need for you to not believe so
54:23 I don't want you to ever feel any
54:23 competition with you hanging on to a
54:26 theory you know the I think the one
54:31 fantasy we all have is for someone to
54:34 bring us the real information something
54:36 like a bunch of new information that no
54:38 one else had to explain away the
54:41 conspiracy and then to see how I got
54:43 explained away you know what did I
54:45 believe and why did I believe it and
54:46 then what actually took place
54:48 but then again because the government
54:51 okay this is part of Jessup's book
54:55 because the government has become a
54:57 lying organization because they have
55:00 allowed you know deep Staters to get in
55:03 there and hide everything we come up
55:05 with these things like bob lazar s--
55:07 spaceships that are over an s4 a place
55:09 that no one's ever found and area 51 and
55:13 you know it's just this stuff just keeps
55:14 going right the 1i i think personally
55:18 since i got a little time left here
55:19 we're kind of done with the main topic
55:21 at this point the one that i would love
55:24 to have someone explained because i have
55:28 to say you know i'm gonna say this but i
55:30 will say that the attempts to do what i
55:32 am about to say have been so utterly
55:35 pathetic i mean pathetic all caps man
55:39 that it makes it more real
55:41 i wonder if they even know what they're
55:43 doing if this is reverse psychology
55:46 techne
55:47 to make me double down because some
55:49 people will just you know if I said
55:50 Jesus never existed and you were raised
55:53 to believe Jesus existed well then you
55:54 have no genetic capability of ever
55:58 refuting that claim you just believed it
56:01 was real because it's been pounded into
56:03 our genetics for 2,000 years plus your
56:05 parents raised in it you have no hope
56:07 okay and I don't need you to believe
56:10 either way you can believe whatever you
56:11 want it's cool but like the Roswell
56:14 thing I like I said I went in I've said
56:17 this a few times but I'm gonna go
56:19 slightly different route here so bear
56:20 with me
56:21 the Roswell thing is I'm going in having
56:24 written articles in the past about how
56:26 these UFOs are psyops to make a one
56:30 government believe they have more
56:31 technology than another government and
56:34 the Philadelphia Experiment Way was
56:36 asserted that they had alien technology
56:39 but the problem is you have a chicken
56:40 and egg problem because Roswell is
56:42 typically the big go-to for technology
56:46 like you know fiber optics and velcro
56:49 and silicon chips right that's that's
56:56 four years later doesn't make any sense
56:59 and according to even the conspiracy
57:01 theorists they didn't meet aliens until
57:03 after they built this electromagnetic
57:05 manipulator thing and so you can't have
57:09 one before the other right so where did
57:11 you encounter aliens prior of course
57:13 there's plenty of stories to talk about
57:15 how that might have occurred and there's
57:18 plenty of theories that say that you
57:19 know aliens are all humans from the
57:20 future I honestly say that might be the
57:24 most believable story but all right why
57:26 we're not touching base with ourselves
57:28 more intently I don't know now with the
57:32 Roswell thing is that you have a
57:33 conspiracy right from the very beginning
57:35 a cover story I should say on top of the
57:38 conspiracy that it was a weather balloon
57:40 again when you listen to the eyewitness
57:42 stories about this you have to first
57:46 understand something never tell you
57:47 which is that Roswell New Mexico Air
57:50 Force Base was the epicenter of weather
57:54 balloon technology
57:56 in the United States not the world but
57:58 in the United States maybe the world who
58:00 knows so when the people who worked
58:03 there saw the debris from the ship and
58:06 that was the guy that was wearing the
58:09 bridge game taking over for the guy that
58:11 actually was called out to grab the the
58:13 parts of pieces of the ship not knowing
58:16 why his friend didn't show up when that
58:18 guy comes back to the bridge game and
58:19 says here's a box of all this stuff take
58:22 a look this came out of a spaceship and
58:24 they're all wow that's great that we
58:26 have alien contact finally right no
58:29 problem with that theory and then it was
58:31 looking at a couple different forms of
58:34 black plastic a couple different forms
58:35 of the aluminum and the really thin
58:37 stuff but the other i-beam stuff with
58:39 purple embedded embossed writing
58:41 chemically embedded into the actual eye
58:43 beam which was like you know maybe an
58:46 inch and its longest dimension in terms
58:48 of its height and then it was like a
58:50 footlong thing and then he said you know
58:53 the guy said well that's nothing come
58:55 out to my truck I got a whole bunch more
58:56 and he said they walked out to his
58:57 pickup and he had just huge pieces of
59:00 the spaceship out there okay the big
59:04 gotcha there was the guy telling the
59:06 story never wrote a book never sold a
59:07 t-shirt didn't own some Roswell gas
59:09 station so he's just tell me think I was
59:11 old [ __ ] and he was like in his 80s
59:13 right so he's telling that story and he
59:15 is a weather balloon expert total expert
59:19 well his buddy who's called out to pick
59:21 up the pieces is also an expert which is
59:23 why they called him in the first place
59:25 it wasn't some crazy experimental
59:30 weather balloon - since nuclear bombs
59:33 going off in Russia that's what they
59:36 said I'm sure they built that - if they
59:38 could conceive it but the you listening
59:42 to all the people the guy that actually
59:44 boxed up all the pieces put him on a
59:46 plane in Roswell which then flew to
59:50 Texas and then the pieces and parts were
59:54 moved to another plane which was then
59:55 flown to wright-patterson Air Force Base
59:57 while none of it went inside and then of
60:02 course there's a presentation inside
60:03 with pieces and parts of a weather
60:05 balloon balsa wood and also there kind
60:06 of stuff
60:07 and the funny thing was is that the the
60:11 i-beam with these you know hieroglyphs
60:14 on him or whatever that you can find on
60:16 the web it wasn't a part of the
60:21 photographs that were shown in the press
60:23 conference that they had yet today the
60:27 the deep state folks call up the
60:31 surviving son of the gentleman who
60:33 picked it all up and keep berating him
60:37 for 20 years calling him once a year
60:38 saying isn't the stuff that you said
60:40 that you saw just tape off some toy
60:44 company out of some toy company in New
60:46 York and he's like no it wasn't tape at
60:49 all it was a steel beam and the writing
60:52 was embedded like like oxidized metal
60:55 you know and I think it was the tape and
60:59 so they eventually sent him some of the
61:01 tape and it was completely stupid you
61:03 know different than anything that he
61:06 said he had seen raised isn't even
61:08 remotely match at least they could have
61:09 they could have made tape right they
61:14 know what the beam looks like it's on
61:16 the internet so just make a tape that
61:17 looks similar to it and then confuse the
61:19 the the son of the air force guy who
61:22 became a doctor by the way and MD and so
61:27 then at least he would have a little bit
61:28 of like oh well yeah it kind of does
61:29 look like that you think about it but
61:31 the press conference didn't have any of
61:32 the tape but supposedly tapes all over
61:35 the the weather blood whatever I was
61:42 shown a friend of mine today some
61:44 renders that people have done some
61:46 modeling and surrenders inside blender
61:48 3d just some unbelievably gorgeous stuff
61:52 right and she looked at me and she goes
61:55 so we're screwed right and I'm like whoa
61:58 maybe what are you talking about she
62:00 goes well at this point reality is
62:05 completely up for grabs in terms of
62:07 anybody wants to fake anything you can
62:09 fake it because this rendering it was
62:10 like a subway car and inside and it just
62:16 was photo real I mean me with my eyeball
62:19 I can tell
62:21 CGT but someone has to tell me is this
62:25 real or is this CG and then my eyeball
62:26 goes oh yeah I can see the texture there
62:29 oh yeah that pattern is repeated over
62:30 there on that side like the splatter on
62:32 the walls over there on this wall the
62:34 chaotic thing repeating itself is always
62:35 gonna be synthetic but if I just were to
62:38 glance at it and go I don't know it must
62:39 be an article about subways thank you I
62:41 just wouldn't know reason why I
62:43 mentioned that is that what if you know
62:45 the government showed you a whole photo
62:46 album of aliens ships technology
62:50 whatever maybe even their cities their
62:52 their worlds what have you then you
62:58 wouldn't know hey whether or not it's
63:00 real or not if they really wanted to
63:01 create the imagery to make it work by
63:04 the way the project Montauk is also a
63:06 project that's given credit let's just
63:09 say the shock guy essentially eluded the
63:13 fact that it was the clandestine team
63:16 that actually did the moon landing fakes
63:19 which is very interesting and I think
63:23 it's interesting because if you read
63:24 that in the Montauk documentation then
63:27 you have this sort of like it's sort of
63:30 reversed legitimizes the project like oh
63:33 well we know the moon hoax were faked
63:35 and so well maybe then the Montauk might
63:37 be real until a partition is real then
63:39 time-travel is real you know it's like
63:40 they kind of egg you into potential
63:44 legitimizing one of these other things
63:47 that's going on right anyway for those
63:49 of you that have suggested the episode
63:51 definitely chimed in with your whole
63:55 journey with this thing I would
63:59 definitely recommend if you haven't
64:00 heard of these players you know the
64:02 Morris Jessup the Carl Allen guy they
64:07 helped by lack dude definitely look
64:10 these people up because they're at the
64:12 heart of why the conspiracy was reborn
64:15 in the 80s you know the movie itself
64:17 inspired the al guy to start his whole
64:20 storyline the other one is to remember
64:26 what Bill Cooper told us and for those
64:29 of you don't remember Bill Cooper he was
64:31 assassinated
64:33 I believe as a result of predicting and
64:38 constantly saying that 9/11 was an
64:41 inside job he predicted it before it
64:42 happened a second that bin Laden was
64:44 interviewed on CNN he goes right there
64:47 they're setting us up because if seening
64:49 can get to him and he's the most wanted
64:50 man in the military US military the we
64:53 could definitely get to him as a
64:55 military organization and kill him but
64:57 they're propping him up as a big
64:58 terrorist to blame the something on him
65:01 he died in November of 2001 so what
65:05 happens in September he's running his
65:07 mouth and they eventually kill the guy
65:09 but what he told us was very very
65:12 interesting he's probably one of the
65:15 more interesting guys that had been
65:17 cracking conspiracy theories way before
65:19 the internet really took off but I
65:22 believe the year was 1967 he was in the
65:25 Navy he was doing guard duty and he said
65:28 that you know during his guard duty said
65:30 the ocean opened up and ships came
65:33 flying out of the ocean and went way up
65:35 into the sky and he's just mortified
65:38 right how did he respond to that right
65:40 before he could really go anywhere open
65:44 back up again and ships went down inside
65:46 he got the distinct sense that these
65:49 were different sets of ships but he
65:50 could be wrong but why leave and then
65:52 come back doesn't make any sense they
65:54 said it happened right in front of him
65:55 there were other crewmen on the deck of
65:58 the ship they were all called inside
66:01 they were able to talk for a little
66:03 while until a few hours later black
66:05 suits helicoptered in on the ship this
66:08 warned him all secrecy and then he was
66:09 given Q clearance which is Queen's
66:12 clearance and then he was inducted into
66:15 a program that was supposedly taking
66:18 care of all the sightings making sure
66:21 that this info was always out there to
66:23 throw people off of the scent right so
66:27 he goes into this really deep
66:29 organization quite legitimately for a
66:33 number of years I think it was about a
66:35 decade but he pops out and then for
66:39 whatever reason his conscience got the
66:41 best of them and so he started talking
66:43 about it
66:44 and I think that they realize you know
66:47 he was basically saying it's all true
66:49 it's all true it's all true but by the
66:51 90s he had done an interview as I saw
66:54 the interview the tape of it it was
66:57 seeing in was actually conduct the
66:58 interview and it was him in his living
67:00 room and he had the balls to say he goes
67:03 look I know what I saw in the ocean was
67:06 real but I don't know that anything they
67:08 told me after that was real I don't they
67:11 disavowed me he had a huge suspicion in
67:14 his heart that it was all disinfo after
67:18 that don't know and I don't know what he
67:21 was shown and I can't remember anything
67:23 else he was specifically talking about
67:24 because it was all off-camera you know
67:28 but he got really disgruntled with the
67:30 whole thing and then I don't know how he
67:33 was able to figure out what he figured
67:34 out but I you know you would assume that
67:36 someone who has deep clearance can get
67:40 to other sectors of clearance right so
67:42 say this guy's in a UFO program for
67:46 however many years then he pops out but
67:49 you know you know people you know other
67:51 people there in the break room they're
67:53 coming to the base their other facility
67:55 whatever and it seemed like for me for
68:00 him to call out Oh some up in London in
68:03 the early part of he was like May or
68:05 something in 2001 when seeing in aired
68:07 their interview prepping us you know
68:10 doing predictive programming with us
68:12 same month that x-files did they're
68:14 playing against the World Trade Center
68:16 it up so the guy had moved from who
68:20 cares UFO talk to oh my god you know
68:26 serious stuff is starting to occur and
68:29 so you kind of have to listen to it you
68:33 know and you if you are like me he was a
68:36 very healthy guy and dying in November
68:40 of 2001 I he's not dying of a heart
68:41 attack necessarily right
68:44 um he was murdered by gunshot he was
68:47 only 58 years old so someone killed him
68:50 who the hell just killed somebody right
68:56 he was on to something it was really
68:58 strange but I think what we know from
69:01 waking up in the 21st century is that it
69:05 does open your eyes and you see things
69:07 that can't be unseen and you learn
69:09 methodologies that can't be unlearned
69:11 and so it assists you for the rest of
69:14 your life and seeing everything
69:17 differently and it produces a few
69:19 incompatibilities with other human
69:21 beings because you you know you start to
69:24 look around you immediately see
69:25 something now you can get delusional
69:27 right you can read into everything
69:29 that's why you know if you have them
69:33 into deep thoughts radio.com
69:34 please go it's got video audio social
69:38 media it has a couple ways to donate to
69:41 the show make sure you're still
69:43 subscribed now we're having huge
69:45 problems with that right now
69:46 I mean they've got this show gate which
69:49 makes you feel kind of good because the
69:51 information is just too hot form it's
69:54 probably on up to censorship system
69:56 meaning they don't really look too deep
69:58 into what I say but what have you we
70:00 have a store a patreon gets you episodes
70:04 before they come out in most cases
70:05 except for like special reports that
70:06 need to go out really fast but also get
70:08 to 20 percent discount NH any credits
70:10 forever it's kind of cool we might be
70:13 making some adjustments to the entire
70:15 patreon platform in terms of leveling
70:17 and tiers and rewards you get for that
70:19 stuff so I'm gonna make an episode for
70:22 the patreon folks to kind of explore
70:24 those options season one's on a
70:27 different channel they had a bunch of
70:29 copyright problems dude the music
70:32 industry and you have to understand that
70:34 a lot of them will still play for
70:38 Americans but a lot of videos were
70:40 banned in Europe amusing industry just
70:42 has a [ __ ] up everything right so those
70:44 are all fixed up on the different
70:46 channel audio balance all that good
70:47 stuff so until next time take care of
70:51 yourself and someone else and I'll see
70:53 you in the next deep thoughts
