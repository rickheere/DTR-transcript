00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen
00:33 for another normal show smokin this nub
00:38 Cameroon here it's really funny one of
00:41 the guys somebody posted something about
00:44 how I don't know how to smoke cigars
00:47 I'll just tell you a secret the people
00:50 that run around telling you that there's
00:51 a way to smoke a cigar are those they
00:54 have no clue how to smoke a cigar and
00:56 they only smoke little cheapy new worlds
00:58 and it's this whole thing was how I was
01:01 actually physically smoking it which is
01:03 hilarious as if you can tell on the dark
01:06 you know it's kind of funny it's he's
01:08 one of those guys that always comments
01:10 about your zipper being undone and
01:11 something's on your crotch on the
01:13 outside of your pants and it's like a a
01:15 once you stop looking at my balls while
01:17 I'm [ __ ] talking to you gay so
01:22 there's this new documentary coming out
01:24 called what's out now for 20 20 bucks on
01:26 Amazon you know here we are in the
01:29 middle of this everyone's unemployed and
01:32 the guy releases his video for $20
01:34 online it's dr. Steven Greer really
01:37 singing a documentary on Close
01:40 Encounters of the fifth kind and a
01:44 friend of mine sent me kind of an
01:45 advanced trailer which calls right out
01:50 to our feeding attraction episode which
01:51 just came out a few days ago now what I
01:55 want to talk about during this episode
01:56 is this notion that you know he's
01:59 painted a picture of UFOs and how they
02:02 were sorry shouldn't said
02:04 extraterrestrial extraterrestrials and
02:06 how they're actually playing a role like
02:10 they're they're upgrading the narrative
02:12 considerably I think for most of the
02:15 stories that we've already heard but
02:17 there was this video I guess it's part
02:21 of his part of his movie which is it's
02:25 called like the other 1% so 1% of the
02:29 world's population is 75 million people
02:32 roughly right and what he asserts is
02:36 what was already published and it's no
02:38 there's no violation and saying it again
02:40 and saying it better because he tends to
02:42 create a great product he really creates
02:45 an entertaining product
02:47 you could think what you want about
02:48 Greer but he delivers and he keeps
02:51 upgrading his offering and it seems to
02:54 be kind of harmless fun you know we'll
02:57 get into all that but as part of his
03:01 film I guess and this is just some
03:03 b-side track that he didn't put in the
03:05 film the book the holographic universe
03:10 if you haven't seen it if you haven't
03:12 read it you can get her to any bookstore
03:14 or online probably at an audiobook as
03:18 well as I remember the book the first
03:21 half of the book is really what he's
03:23 talking about in the second half of the
03:24 book goes really wild about stories of
03:29 people in Africa that could manifest
03:31 things just by squeezing volcanic dirt
03:34 and they could come up with candy
03:36 anything they saw foreigners bring in
03:38 they could mass-produce this one dude
03:39 Kumasi produced jewelry and all kinds of
03:42 stuff the first half of the book talks
03:46 about our participation in creating this
03:49 universe and affecting it you see the
03:53 misnomer for me in my opinion is that we
03:56 totally control this place but because
03:58 there's so much movement it's like it's
04:02 like everyone is peddling a big vehicle
04:06 going in a direction and if you want the
04:08 thing to change directions the most you
04:11 could do is you know push in a different
04:14 direction and maybe on some micron level
04:16 the vehicle changes direction right you
04:19 have to get the whole group of people
04:20 got laugh there no one's like left in
04:22 the thing goes left right so we think we
04:25 can only create tiny changes which is
04:30 probably proportionate to the population
04:32 maybe what can go on unbeknownst to me I
04:38 guess he presents a graphic that says
04:41 that there are universities all around
04:45 the world that I guess have been around
04:46 for decades like more than three decades
04:48 that have random number generators which
04:51 are powered on at all times
04:53 the numbers are transcribed and tracked
04:56 and during events like 9/11 and other
04:59 gigantic things these machines behave
05:02 differently aka ie they are more ie they
05:09 are not so random there's chemical
05:14 states where I guess you can freeze
05:16 helium down to a particular state and I
05:18 forgot exactly the terminology but it's
05:21 one of these situations that at this
05:23 pure point in the freezing process you
05:27 have utter unification of the ether and
05:30 therefore you have the perfect liquid
05:32 you know he's always been a big
05:35 proponent as I understand it that if you
05:39 can get a group of people to come
05:41 together and think and this has been
05:44 proven and different things you know
05:46 those folks that the Japanese guy that
05:48 created artwork of snowflakes based on a
05:52 group of people sitting in a circle
05:54 thinking towards the water as it froze
05:56 and then hate water looked really gross
05:59 and love water was gorgeous and unified
06:03 but he's been claiming for twenty years
06:06 that all you have to do to to get aliens
06:08 to show up and I think Whitley Strieber
06:10 may have been one of the first people to
06:11 say this you just need to get together
06:14 multiple people and think towards them
06:16 and then they come towards you and then
06:18 you have an experience whether you seen
06:20 most of them only have lights in the sky
06:22 sort of thing again no contacts I mean
06:26 what's strange about the whole idea
06:29 because when I was again you guys have
06:31 heard the story hundreds of episodes ago
06:34 I keep I kept telling the story over and
06:36 over again while I was reading with the
06:38 streamers book communion at the end it
06:43 was Christmas time and I woke up talking
06:45 to a grey alien who told me what was in
06:47 one of my Christmas gifts and it was the
06:50 most most unique Christmas gift that I
06:52 had never seen in real life which was
06:53 origami paper I was certain it was an
06:56 album because it was square and thin
06:57 look up the next day go funds washing
07:00 dishes I'm looking right at her and I
07:02 sit down and looking at this things like
07:03 it's an LP she always gives me records
07:05 and I love that and I touched it and it
07:07 was soft and then I'll said I'm like
07:09 holy crap I couldn't have guessed it
07:11 because I don't have any it didn't have
07:14 any knowledge that origami people were
07:17 square if anyone had asked me at
07:18 gunpoint I would have said it by 11 do
07:22 you know I would have said the papers
07:23 colorful on both sides I didn't know
07:26 idea was only colored on one side and
07:27 that part of origami is twofold it's
07:29 such the whites on the inside and the
07:31 colors on the outside I mean if it
07:32 wasn't difficult enough guys
07:34 so in his movie he is going to
07:38 demonstrate this because the trailer has
07:40 it it looks like they're standing on
07:42 tombstones almost in this tiny clip it's
07:46 you split second clip or they're kind of
07:47 holding their arms out
07:50 and I mean what's cool about it is he's
07:53 conducting experiments like that I mean
07:55 you know who does that
07:56 hey can we go in the desert and then
07:58 I'll stand around talking to aliens you
08:00 know when they're not there and then see
08:02 if they come sure you know now some
08:07 people think that Grier is an insider
08:08 who is prepping and priming humanity for
08:12 the fake alien invasion and that he he
08:17 disseminates truth about the
08:19 intelligence agencies and 911 and stuff
08:21 to get you on his side and then he's
08:23 steering you into thinking that the
08:25 these aliens exist I definitely had a
08:30 short stint in my life where I was very
08:32 cynical about that guy I wouldn't say
08:34 very but probably my version of very
08:37 which is not so intense but his I don't
08:43 know I mean if we're looking at agenda
08:45 21 killing everyone off with this
08:47 full-on faccia gates the foundation
08:53 virus that I finally found the patent on
08:55 it which is so odd I read the patent
08:58 today and it was like the whole genome
08:59 sequence is in the patent but talks
09:02 about how it's going to facilitate a
09:03 vaccination also there's stuff in Psych
09:04 that just makes no viral sense right
09:06 it's like oh we're gonna we're gonna
09:09 create a catcher's mitt for snowflakes
09:11 and if it has to be exactly this shape
09:14 size and before the catcher's mitt works
09:17 it the if the snowflake is different the
09:19 catcher's mitt doesn't work and it's
09:20 like that's a virus right it's always
09:22 different you can't it always mutates
09:24 everything mutates constantly if you
09:27 just look at the viral the life of a
09:30 virus in this world you would go how the
09:32 hell's is ever gonna be the same you
09:34 know so anyway back to Greer I think
09:39 what he's promoting is one he's he's a
09:43 physician
09:44 he's an MDS and ER MD who then retired
09:48 was promoting this stuff on the East
09:50 Coast
09:52 then he miraculously gets pulled in by
09:56 the Central Intelligence Agency and is
09:58 told to be you know to work with them
10:03 it's like yeah credibility kind of just
10:06 got real thin there right but there's
10:09 this thing he wants to create an
10:12 avalanche for witches hey everybody
10:16 let's take this manifest destiny this
10:21 consensus reality as I call it and let's
10:25 all think towards let's try to get 1% of
10:28 the population 75 million people or more
10:30 to do my magic box trick which is to all
10:34 have the same thought to see if we can
10:35 manifest a better reality
10:39 maybe it's a pacification during the
10:42 time of the demise of mankind but now
10:45 his narration of aliens you know it's
10:48 it's interesting it's like um he doesn't
10:52 officially say I don't think in his
10:54 entire career doing this that the aliens
10:58 are this way there's only one species
11:00 there's two species they're doing this
11:01 they're doing that he has always been
11:04 kind of a listener with his disclosure
11:06 project which I believe is 2001 ish
11:08 somewhere way back then looked at Europe
11:13 before you quoted to anybody but like I
11:16 said in several episodes he pulls in a
11:18 bunch of people who are contractors
11:20 military people and he says like you've
11:23 all been sworn to secrecy from 20 to 50
11:26 years
11:27 remember the 50-year secrecy act is
11:31 designed to get you to your death before
11:33 you can say anything on remote occasions
11:38 people exceed those and on other remote
11:39 occasions people violate those but they
11:42 all got together and then they had a
11:44 little press conference which was a
11:47 fairly decent-sized and they all went up
11:48 to the podium and quoted what they were
11:50 involved in and said that they'd be
11:51 willing to testify in a court of law
11:54 that this happened and kind of by having
11:58 everyone's back and by disclosing it
12:01 there's very little threat left in them
12:04 towards those who want to conceal it
12:06 right then like I said before he's done
12:09 lots of interviews of folks I think most
12:11 of them reek of fiction there's a few
12:15 that are good as gold and that really
12:18 that's what you want I mean seriously if
12:20 we had the deep thoughts college and we
12:23 had funding or we make inventions that
12:26 we can sell to create money and we had
12:28 the money to do what he did he did it
12:30 you travel all across the globe
12:34 you have to talk to every single person
12:36 on planet Earth and he definitely
12:38 focused on Americans but you'd want to
12:41 interview everyone and you're gonna sift
12:43 through probably 98% crap people making
12:45 up stories or at least it changed their
12:49 stories in previous tellings they can't
12:51 remember
12:52 nothing makes sense you know bob lazar
12:55 sing he's got two degrees from the two
12:57 biggest colleges on earth but he doesn't
12:59 have a t-shirt or a photograph of ever
13:01 being there no one has any folktale
13:03 stories of the smartest guy they know in
13:05 the world right if you knew someone in
13:08 this world that got a big physics degree
13:10 from Caltech and MIT you would know
13:13 their name you would know what year they
13:15 did it they would be famous in social
13:18 circles and especially academic circles
13:20 in fact he would have never had to work
13:24 for the military he would have just had
13:26 to have done what Neil deGrasse Tyson
13:29 did know the grass Tyson doesn't have
13:30 two degrees like that and that dude's
13:32 famous Bill Nye the douchebag guy he has
13:37 no no degree in science other than it
13:40 was a civil engineering or something and
13:42 he's famous so Bob Lazar would have been
13:44 utterly utterly renowned way before they
13:48 said that they erased him again family
13:52 photos how do you go to a university for
13:54 a year two years which is MIT or Caltech
13:57 and you don't take a photo you don't
13:59 have an alumni shirt you don't have a
14:01 degree
14:01 piece of paper what do they sneak into
14:04 your house and burn everything up I mean
14:06 it's just the tall tale okay so at least
14:11 Grier kind of told you you talk to the
14:15 agencies you talk to the government and
14:17 if it turns out to be nefarious well at
14:19 least he told you right to your face but
14:25 what I think is interesting is this
14:26 whole thing is evolving and he seems to
14:29 be sort of this cornerstone of evolution
14:35 in these theories meaning we hang on to
14:38 previous storylines that people have
14:41 told quite a long time ago like again
14:44 the greys were really popular well first
14:46 it was green men from outer space and
14:48 then it eventually evolves to grays and
14:50 then David I took it to the reptilians
14:52 then by his disclosure thing some guy
14:56 sat in his disclosure project and said
14:58 there's like 27 aliens that he knows of
15:01 a species right
15:02 and then when they
15:05 press cases well what do they look like
15:07 the guy goes blank and he he doesn't
15:10 know he's made up that he's a cook it's
15:12 a complete lie
15:13 he's sitting on the panel too which is
15:15 really crappy in the just like us know
15:18 how convenient right I mean seriously I
15:22 mean yeah I could be in that thing just
15:24 as a writer and just bold-faced lie to
15:26 everybody if I'm gonna lie it would have
15:28 been well some of them look like us and
15:30 others look like reptilians and there's
15:34 some that are insect to heed the greys
15:36 definitely exist but there's two or
15:38 three races degrees I mean if you just
15:39 make it up right what's so hard about
15:41 that crap right it's just nuts but
15:44 luckily they're not good at lying it's
15:46 good so but in his trailer for this new
15:52 movie Close Encounters of the fifth kind
15:53 what a great name rate he is saying I
15:57 believe he says the number four I think
16:03 maybe gesture did or something and we
16:05 wasn't attending it but I think he said
16:07 something like four species and it's
16:12 like they're watching mankind to see
16:15 what we're going to do and they love the
16:18 thing that it's when we discovered
16:20 nuclear weapons they became concerned
16:23 and so the idea is are we going to exit
16:27 the world and and pose a problem now the
16:29 the truth of the matter is that I don't
16:33 remember what his stance is on the moon
16:35 I think he probably believes we went but
16:39 the idea that we know so far we haven't
16:41 pulled it off and I mean like real deep
16:45 interstellar travel interplanetary
16:47 travel we just haven't done it I mean no
16:50 one no one is continuing we've never
16:54 been to another planet the only thing
16:56 that we can't end on this show is that
16:57 through information that we've received
16:59 and some mega deductions and logic we
17:04 haven't been to the moon either we want
17:07 to go we need to figure it out but if
17:10 the aliens are really looking at us and
17:12 going oh that's that's all you got okay
17:14 well you know he turned to another alien
17:16 they're like well they're not going to
17:17 get off this
17:18 Rock or this whatever differ visibly a
17:23 long time you know what I don't know
17:26 that has ever been postulated is the
17:30 fault what if we are them which I
17:35 believe almost de-facto we are if we are
17:40 them and they've dropped us off for this
17:43 experiment to watch us to see what we do
17:46 you know imagine you woke up in a
17:49 society that is billions of years old
17:52 which is what he said in the trailer
17:53 some of these species are millions of
17:55 years older and some of these species
17:57 are billions of years older which means
17:59 the million year species should be
18:01 answering to the billion your species
18:03 you would think the but you're
18:08 completely sophisticated and so there's
18:11 no more war and there's no more issues
18:14 now there's there's a biological genetic
18:16 issue here I'm gonna confront myself
18:19 with but what if they dropped off you
18:22 know a Caucasian species and African
18:24 species you know Chinese species or
18:27 China or Asian species so I should say
18:28 and bunch of little subsets right they
18:31 dropped us off a really long time ago
18:34 you know they're they're native Landers
18:37 have fun with pyramids and all kinds of
18:40 stuff using you know materials that are
18:42 here taking advantage of ether old
18:44 technologies and the sort of the natural
18:48 exuding energy from the meridians of the
18:51 earth to move big stones and they just
18:53 kind of set up and have some fun knowing
18:56 that this is going to eventually catch
18:58 up because they're in Egypt these
19:00 African folks I just watched a whole
19:02 boatload of new Egyptology videos and
19:06 it's just so evidence you look at the
19:08 paintings as people argue with me all
19:10 the time you know some people just
19:13 racist and they can't handle it they're
19:14 just like they're they weren't black
19:16 people and was like yes they were they
19:18 may not be the ones that are there now
19:19 but they definitely were they have been
19:21 taken over over the years and they ended
19:23 up being Arab and I'm sure there was
19:25 some Arab pharaohs as well but King
19:27 Tut's bust even though he was a more
19:30 narrow nose
19:32 you know it's very evident from their
19:34 paintings from their illustrations from
19:36 their coloring they made themselves that
19:39 way but anyway so if you're sitting
19:41 there in Egypt thinking okay we know the
19:43 full plant now some Aborigines are being
19:45 dropped off in Australia south of here
19:48 beginning a home of the batch of
19:50 different folks
19:51 Europe's getting these white folks and
19:54 Asia's got this other thing going on
19:56 Native Americans all this stuff so your
20:00 Incas and then eventually over thousands
20:03 of years they know they're gonna bump
20:05 into each other but for now everybody's
20:06 safe you can have a good time because
20:08 they want to see without all the
20:11 technology and education
20:14 what would their species do you just
20:16 want to know for any race that seems
20:20 superior right unfortunately what's
20:23 what's interesting about this little
20:25 superior race thing is you know the only
20:29 the only exception to this rule would be
20:31 maybe the Nazis you know they seem to be
20:33 really smart you know they managed to
20:35 create a massive army with all this
20:36 technology so yeah they were rolling
20:39 with some serious brain power okay but
20:42 when you come over the United States and
20:44 you look at the white folks that say the
20:45 white race is superior if you have a
20:48 full mouth of teeth you are utterly
20:51 lucky right but they just seem to be
20:53 super undereducated folks yeah you know
20:56 it's okay to want to preserve your kind
20:58 I mean that's okay but to the extent you
21:00 would you know just like other races
21:03 just like it's just it's just strange
21:05 just go have babies man that's how you
21:06 do it the fallacy with my presentation
21:10 for the hypothesis of them dropping
21:13 themselves off being US would be that we
21:16 would have to kind of root out the good
21:18 genes because there would be one we're
21:21 not gray aliens right so we're not
21:22 reptilians we're not these other species
21:24 so we would have to actually sort of
21:29 filter out all the benefits we have had
21:31 genetically you know I'm hoping that if
21:34 we ever lived a million to a billion
21:35 years agreed is something that filters
21:39 out of us and I shared a book project
21:42 with Robert Lee well in the comedian
21:44 England
21:45 he wrote the first I think seven
21:46 chapters and I wrote the last five
21:48 chapters and I wrote a whole section
21:50 about greed and where it comes from and
21:54 I made it a Douglas Adams kind of funny
21:58 intro to the to the book to that
21:59 particular chapter but I'm hoping and
22:02 for my book it was like it was never
22:03 gonna leave any life force in the
22:06 universe because of the the inception
22:08 'el race that created all life was
22:12 massively full of greed you know I think
22:14 they've been doing is diluting it down
22:16 over the over the millennia but so he's
22:22 saying that they're observing us dr.
22:26 Greer and that they're participating and
22:30 that it is his hope I mean everyone's
22:35 hope I would love for this to be true
22:39 did it Tom they're gonna intervene
22:43 they're gonna come down and they're
22:45 gonna intervene in this [ __ ] show which
22:49 is sort of the the George Soros some
22:53 Bill and Melinda Gates file what's going
22:58 on right now and that they're going to
23:01 get us all back on track and what's
23:04 funny about this or interesting about
23:06 this I used to talk about this a lot a
23:09 long time ago
23:10 as I can erase the notion that when you
23:14 read Babylonian scripts from like 4500
23:19 BC which is probably all wrong is it
23:23 there you know for mud tablets that they
23:27 talked about every few hundred years
23:30 this race would come out of the hills
23:32 and reset society get rid of all the
23:36 corrupt leaders take good people and
23:38 appoint them to be the leaders and it go
23:40 away for however many hundred years
23:42 before those folks would disappear into
23:46 the genome and then other lower
23:50 vibration people would move up and
23:53 become a part of the you know leadership
23:56 and then go back to greed but I think
24:00 we've been alive enough but if this has
24:04 occurred just to digress into this for
24:07 one second the unfortunate thing is you
24:15 know America love us or hate us
24:17 forefathers really did have some cool
24:20 [ __ ] put together the Bill of Rights
24:23 which became the Constitution and then
24:27 they protected everything free speech
24:29 guns try to keep the World Bank out of
24:32 the system and they lost to it very
24:34 quickly of course just the second these
24:36 guys died these [ __ ] are right there
24:38 taking it back over again but they're
24:41 all Masonic weren't they
24:43 I just listened to some other video it
24:47 was a New Yorker who became a master
24:51 Mason and he sits in front of me some of
24:54 you've seen this he sits in front of a
24:56 table and a night doesn't appear to have
24:59 like the highest IQ on planet Earth god
25:02 bless him I mean if it was Richard
25:04 Fineman telling me this it would be a
25:06 whole different thing but he says he
25:10 says look you get up to about 30 degrees
25:14 and you don't know anything you believe
25:16 all the hype that they've told you but
25:18 then 131 32 and 33 and then I guess you
25:23 get anointed to master
25:24 that you learned that they're all
25:26 Satanists and you know they believe in
25:30 the devil is there dude and which seems
25:35 strange because if you look at that that
25:39 kid on YouTube with the long hair he
25:41 typically does he doesn't quite do it
25:44 anymore but used to wear the leather
25:44 jacket with the open chest and he had
25:48 666 part of his thing because he used to
25:50 be a saint worshiper
25:52 and he said well you know I learned was
25:54 that that guy said that he made a whole
25:56 episode of BOTS like eight years old
25:58 and he said well if you have any
26:00 religion in your part of the Church of
26:02 Satan they laugh at you because they
26:03 don't believe in anything and so if
26:05 you're if you worship anything according
26:08 to him they think that you're primitive
26:11 and you're stupid and so he goes the
26:13 whole joke on the public is that they
26:16 think they we think that they worship
26:18 Baphomet and a bunch of other stuff and
26:21 you know there's so many makes signals
26:23 but you're talking about an institution
26:24 that lies to stay in existence so I
26:27 wouldn't take anything from any of these
26:29 folks but I can't reking reconcile you
26:34 know what does the Google mails icon is
26:36 the apron from a Mason gonna look it up
26:39 they'll look up Google Mail icon and
26:41 then Masonic apron
26:45 it's the saint looks like a piece of
26:47 mail it's literally white and red it's
26:49 exactly Gmail's icon right and so you're
26:53 kind of going who's good who's bad
26:55 we know that the Statue of Liberty
26:58 represents European banking its Queen
27:00 Semiramis right the but that Washington
27:04 monuments the phallus of Nimrod which is
27:06 technically supposedly the husband of
27:08 Semiramis I am eager to see Greer's
27:13 thing but I just for whatever reason I
27:15 don't spend 20 bucks on it it gets a
27:17 little gal G for this time frame I'm
27:20 sure he worked really hard on it and I
27:22 think he does deserve his money back and
27:23 hopefully with the folks that are early
27:25 adopters he manages to make his money
27:27 back what's interesting about it for me
27:31 is that I try to keep a good artery open
27:34 for alienness an alien that now one of
27:38 the things that's starting to loop back
27:41 into the fray especially with
27:42 coast-to-coast am and this is really
27:44 funny man most of you have run into
27:48 Planet X theory which was huge in 2014 I
27:52 believe and they were trying to say you
27:54 know man the world's going to end you
27:57 know it's this whole theory that there's
27:58 this alternate solar system that orbits
28:00 our solar system and that
28:03 there's a different Sun that is gonna
28:06 come back around I believe it's called
28:10 nemesis the planets Nibiru and it's it's
28:13 circles nemesis like hopefully I got
28:15 these names right and that that planet
28:17 actually holds our ancestors which
28:21 genetically spliced themselves into the
28:23 primates of Earth to create a slave
28:26 nation which then mined the world dry of
28:30 a bunch of gold because they needed gold
28:33 in their atmospheres so they wouldn't
28:34 die I mean it's just like a kind of a
28:36 bad sci-fi story right you've got
28:38 genetic engineering capabilities and you
28:41 can't make your own gold out of you know
28:44 fusion sounds stupid
28:46 the George Noory just had this guy on
28:49 who predicted the world was going to end
28:51 in 2014 and so they start the interview
28:57 off and George Noory is like well you
28:58 know you're still alive and you're still
29:00 here and what's really going on as the
29:03 dude needs more money so he's milking it
29:05 one more time taking advantage of the
29:09 fact that Russia had a meteorite that
29:12 came in yeah big mother that blew up and
29:16 all this other stuff and again okay so
29:19 it shows up it does the sonic boom it
29:22 blows up into some pieces it blows up a
29:24 ton of Windows it's film from a ton of
29:26 different angles and what we the only
29:29 thing that was really strange about that
29:31 footage I mean defacto strange about the
29:34 footage well is this thing's coming into
29:36 the atmosphere and it's huge I mean it
29:38 just has to be gigantic it does explode
29:42 it's explosion is so profound I watched
29:45 it what half a dozen videos of
29:47 surveillance cameras people holding
29:49 their iPhones or whatever they have over
29:51 there and these windows blew in I mean
29:53 it was serious it was wintertime
29:56 so not a good time to lose your natural
29:59 barrier to the elements for heat but we
30:01 didn't see like a bunch of spaceships
30:03 come out of the thing but I remember and
30:07 no one ever talks about this there was a
30:10 close-up video of it where someone
30:13 appeared to track quite reliably and
30:18 again someone could edit the video but
30:20 then again someone always gets the
30:21 original video like if I went and
30:22 scraped someone's video and went into
30:25 blender and I added a UFO or some
30:27 apparition but you go download the video
30:30 and it doesn't have my editing then you
30:34 just compare the two and you know I
30:35 added it plus it's very very difficult
30:37 to add a an artificial element into live
30:39 action without pros being able to see it
30:42 right but there was this object that
30:47 seemed to go faster then this thing that
30:51 was entering the atmosphere and it it
30:55 caught up with the thing it went it
30:58 faster and then as soon as it touched it
31:00 that's when the explosion occurs well
31:04 the other thing we have to remember
31:05 about that too is if you listen to the
31:07 press response from the military of
31:10 Russia I think one of their heads arse
31:14 of the military said this was a CIA
31:16 weapon now I don't know how you get
31:22 something that large into space and then
31:25 crash it into the earth I don't know how
31:29 you could find a body in space like you
31:33 know supposedly there's the big asteroid
31:36 belt between Mars and Jupiter you know
31:40 you could have a science fiction story
31:42 where you know some rocket goes over to
31:46 some big giant stone in in space and
31:49 then attaches itself and drives it to
31:51 earth and hurls it out of country it's
31:53 just too preposterous try it again
31:55 how do rocket engines work in space when
31:57 there's nothing to push off of it have
31:59 to be a completely different engine that
32:01 we've never seen before
32:03 but again if you if you have that tech
32:06 you just do a tech demonstration to your
32:09 enemy and you say give me all your money
32:10 he would be like pulling out a gun when
32:13 your enemy just has a knife and they're
32:17 20 feet away but isn't it in a Dearing
32:20 idea somehow these aliens which are only
32:26 ever lights in the sky are becoming here
32:31 to protect us they're coming here to
32:32 look at us and I've seen the trailer of
32:36 his video and he has the you know Aurora
32:38 type aircraft with the three lights and
32:41 the triangle and you know it looks like
32:44 a CG shot man it's rotating out anything
32:47 is what's what's fascinating about this
32:49 is how does he come up with the movie
32:52 about UFOs and then all the sudden he's
32:55 got footage that no one's ever seen
32:58 before that's like unbelievable footage
33:00 what does he got a hot hot line out
33:03 there if you come up with the best
33:05 footage give it to me I'll give you a
33:06 bunch of money and don't give it to the
33:09 world and then maybe he makes a movie
33:12 maybe he doesn't you know it's like it
33:13 doesn't make any sense but I'm telling
33:16 you man the the way that you create
33:20 artificial footage that can't be easily
33:25 figured out is that you make the entire
33:28 shot in the computer you don't
33:31 substitute in an element where then you
33:33 can start sniffing the pixels and going
33:36 there's a little bit of a contrast
33:37 element here it all looks normal and it
33:40 looks like those energy most things
33:42 introduced it's very difficult but if
33:44 you take the whole thing because these
33:47 are night shots everything silhouetted
33:49 right so there's no massive detail in it
33:51 you run it through four or five
33:52 different grain filters to make it look
33:54 like a telephone and then the last thing
33:57 you can do is actually film a television
33:58 with the telephone to introduce a bunch
34:02 of new elements I think that in times of
34:07 need there is hope for saviors you know
34:14 I mean there are countries going on
34:17 right now in the world that are
34:18 suffering tremendously and I'm sure that
34:22 the there's either one of two things
34:24 occur
34:25 you have families going to God at record
34:29 levels praying for a fix from the
34:32 heavens and you have people falling from
34:35 faith for good because nothing is coming
34:38 from the heavens and you know what's
34:43 what's interesting to me is that I would
34:48 I would love to you know interview
34:52 someone like Jacob Rothschild and just
35:00 ask the guy question do you believe in
35:01 God
35:02 because there can't in my opinion he can
35:05 never answer the question yes I don't
35:08 think a lot of people can believe in God
35:10 with what's going on right now because
35:11 of their nefarious acts like Pelosi how
35:15 could post e-ever believe in God she has
35:19 to be an atheist at a level that is like
35:21 number one you know and I mentioned I
35:25 wanted to recap on a video I don't even
35:29 know when hell I made this video and I
35:31 don't know where I mentioned it exactly
35:34 Sammy Davis jr. was rumored in the
35:40 seventies to have joined a satanic cult
35:43 he was just fascinated by and he wore
35:46 some amulet from one of their things and
35:49 for me it was sort of tough for me to
35:53 believe that he would need such a thing
35:56 you know because you usually feel like
35:58 you have lost yourself if you're going
36:00 to join a cold you have this emptiness
36:03 and then you go for it and it's some
36:05 sort of structure to your life you know
36:08 now if you read about his life and all
36:10 the problems that they had or he had you
36:13 know showing up to venues where the Rat
36:16 Pack would be doing something and they'd
36:18 find out a black guy was gonna show up
36:19 and they said well you can't bring him
36:21 and he can't be here like at the
36:22 beginning and then Frank Sinatra goes
36:25 well then you can't have me ever again
36:27 [ __ ] you and then there no no he can
36:30 come in you know and so he grew up for
36:34 vests this prejudice cycle and of course
36:36 he's black he was one of the most
36:37 talented
36:38 on planet earth he played all these
36:39 instruments he could sing anything on
36:41 planet earth he could dance and when a
36:42 guy was crazy talented and so I had a
36:45 hard time just logically putting it
36:49 together in my mind
36:50 anybody can do anything I'm not against
36:52 believing that someone anyone could go
36:54 down these roads
36:55 what's Will Ferrell doing at a Branagh
36:58 vich party doing a satanic ritual as a
37:01 joke I mean maybe he's totally a [ __ ]
37:03 in real life and there's nobody's
37:05 working with but anyway Eddie Murphy I
37:10 guess did this ride-along with Seinfeld
37:13 for his little car pool show right and I
37:17 watched this segment on this other
37:19 documentary and it showed Eddie Murphy
37:23 talking about having met Sammy Davis jr.
37:26 and Eddie Murphy was wrong and he was
37:29 like a real human being because actually
37:31 probably the very first time I've ever
37:33 seen him talk totally normal if you want
37:35 to see this just go look it up Eddie
37:37 Murphy Seinfeld show thing you're gonna
37:40 go right along carpool thing and you'll
37:42 see him say it because he I met him and
37:44 he starts impersonating say Matias jr.
37:47 talking about this devil worshipping
37:49 cult that he had joined and that he had
37:50 told Eddie Murphy that that you know he
37:54 says you know the devil is as powerful
37:56 as God you know in any Murphy goes what
38:00 the [ __ ] are you talking about is what
38:02 I'm thinking in my head you know you
38:04 meet your hero and he's trying to tell
38:05 you they he's a devil worshiper and then
38:08 you know he's kind of like indirectly
38:10 soliciting a member and Mindy Murphy was
38:13 like he's not he's not into that you
38:15 know so we are at a point now that is
38:22 again different than anything humanity's
38:25 ever been in before I mean the
38:27 depression it reached levels I mean
38:31 again the Depression hit its peak as I
38:34 was told okay and 33 and 34 but it
38:38 started in 29 dude that's three or four
38:41 or five years later could you imagine
38:44 this [ __ ] show we've got going right
38:46 now in four or five years we're standing
38:50 in soup lines because it's so bad
38:52 I mean that would suck wouldn't it right
38:56 and so you know what was it
38:59 Snow White came out of Disney in 36 and
39:03 blows up the box office because everyone
39:05 is so depressed they want to get out of
39:07 this worlds they go see that movie with
39:08 the last pity they have on planet Earth
39:11 so yeah the idea of aliens is gonna be
39:14 pretty sexy until the world straightens
39:18 up it's what my episode was a season one
39:20 called the alien promise which is what
39:22 do you want to get out of an alien
39:24 landing what is it that you want them to
39:27 offer you now I don't know if I'm the
39:30 only dude okay but I don't I mean you've
39:34 got I think streamer had some videos
39:41 Greer's had two movies now and then tons
39:44 of videos but these videos of just
39:48 lights in the sky everyone gets a
39:50 hard-on for lights in the sky they
39:53 dancing around doing it I guess you know
39:56 if I saw like this guy and I couldn't
39:59 hear a drone engine and it seems to be
40:01 fairly close and it's singing around
40:03 well one you know let's let's educate
40:06 everybody again the center of the earth
40:09 has a plasma ball
40:11 core that's what your compass works it's
40:14 not nickel iron that's a huge lie and
40:17 the other day I was bumping around the
40:19 internet and I found I was just I think
40:21 I was looking in like recommended videos
40:23 on YouTube relate at night and I found a
40:26 video that was a volcano just burping up
40:30 lightning bolts just boom boom boom and
40:32 a lot of you have seen this right it was
40:35 unprecedented amount of lightning bolts
40:36 and the video was something like you
40:39 know why is this happening in the
40:41 narrative person filming it's like wow
40:42 why is this happening because you've
40:45 been lied to about what's in the center
40:46 of the earth what is a volcano it's a
40:50 pretty big hole to the magma layer of
40:52 this earth and so you know you keep
40:56 going down our crust is not that thick
40:58 relative to the total diameter of the
41:01 earth and so you go down just a few
41:02 miles
41:05 especially where you have a volcano
41:07 because you don't have that pristine
41:09 layers we're gonna get oil and a bunch
41:11 of other minerals down there you got a
41:12 you have an opening that's what Hawaii's
41:15 on top of is this amazing volcanic
41:20 eruption area right so what else would
41:23 leak out exactly what Tesla found in
41:29 Springfield Colorado lightning
41:34 electricity power so when you go out
41:40 into the desert in pristine earth right
41:44 not a lot of topsoil lots of rocks out
41:47 there San is just a bunch of little
41:49 teeny rocks a lot of the outcroppings
41:52 that you find in Joshua Tree and Apple
41:55 Valley any major desert in Arizona you
42:01 get a lot of ball lightning ejections
42:04 out of the crust of the earth because
42:08 the seams between the rocks just go
42:10 straight down I mean they're miles and
42:11 miles and miles but you can wait 10,000
42:15 years for one ball to come out but
42:17 they're always just stating up through
42:19 the cracks I used to think lightning
42:23 came from clouds like specifically from
42:29 clouds if you had a rain storm you'd get
42:31 lightning then I moved to Southern
42:33 California and I it was again the
42:36 funniest story was my first day August
42:40 19th 1997 I arrived in Ventura
42:44 California
42:44 I go to my employer first and he's like
42:50 oh my god you already came back I was
42:51 like yeah I need that job okay great
42:53 so he goes well you can stay at my
42:54 buddy's house it's got a room you can
42:57 squat it for a little while so I go into
43:00 this house there's this trench alarm
43:03 that just shows up out of thin air
43:04 lightning Bam Bam Bam and just rain it
43:08 was insane and five minutes later it's
43:12 gone and it's sunny and I go outside and
43:15 there's barely any clouds
43:17 and so I'm thinking hey well I was a
43:19 cool lightning storm look forward to
43:21 those who love those in Kansas it's
43:23 great thing but then it never happened
43:25 again I mean the amount amount of
43:28 electricity I are lightning I've heard
43:30 in Southern California's almost
43:32 non-existent now the Bay Area is
43:35 different San Francisco area I used to
43:38 set a three-story building taking tech
43:40 support calls
43:41 for a database product that I supported
43:44 and I just watched lightning hit the
43:46 ground it was I could just watch it
43:48 literally hit the ground a big old puff
43:49 of smoke would come out of the ground
43:51 where it disrupted the soil well go to
43:55 Phoenix Arizona ask him how many
43:57 lightning storms they have where the
44:00 ground
44:03 is a particular way lightning happens
44:08 because between the clouds that are
44:10 charged and the ground that's charged
44:13 you get this arc of electricity it's
44:17 probably a negative to positive stream
44:20 of cathode cathode lightning okay why
44:25 tell you that because all of these
44:29 lights over Phoenix Arizona which is a
44:32 great viewing spot for this what happens
44:34 you see a stream of lights that are
44:39 seemingly a fairly equal distance from
44:42 each other and then they turn off in
44:43 chronological order of how they turned
44:46 on first-in first-out
44:48 right now sometimes the military will
44:52 say oh yeah we were doing test flights
44:56 training flights and we were doing we're
44:58 dropping flares and so the flares take a
45:02 little while to fall they're designed to
45:04 do that and so you want to the you
45:05 provide z7 and then of course because
45:07 flares have you know fuse links they
45:09 just burn out that way so military has
45:12 cleaned some of them but I've heard
45:16 hikers hiking in complete rocky terrains
45:20 and all sudden a ball lighting goes boom
45:22 and then it will actually stick at a
45:24 particular altitude spinning of course
45:26 it looks like a chrome ball because
45:27 plasma will reflect all light because it
45:31 is moving way faster probably about 50
45:35 times the speed of light right so lights
45:37 just going ding-ding-ding so it looks
45:38 like a crystal ball if it spins
45:40 SuperDuper fast it can turn into a disc
45:43 it hits a negative air pocket which is
45:46 where you're playing goes food you know
45:48 it zaps to the next stable spot in the
45:51 atmosphere which means you know five
45:53 thousand miles an hour it will just go
45:55 wham over to the next spot and then it
45:56 stops on a dime it's dealing with all of
46:00 the atmospheric particles that are also
46:03 charged to determine where it's going to
46:04 go
46:06 so there's nothing exciting you tell me
46:09 about watching UFO claims we're all
46:12 they're looking at is our lights you
46:13 know this one video got posted on our
46:15 Facebook channel yes only he is filming
46:20 some ball in space I mean like if some
46:22 light never tells you what the hell
46:24 she's looking at and then quite
46:26 obviously she is this you know having
46:30 either clouds move in front of it or you
46:33 know she's got some grass in front of it
46:35 I mean she's not cleaning out the shot
46:37 it's just that it's a crappy shot you
46:39 want to see mind blowing stuff you look
46:41 at Dave's posts where he films a star
46:46 with his 500 or 1000 zoom camera that's
46:50 mind-blowing you know these stars have
46:53 Mohawks on them he moves the camera and
46:57 they don't they don't displace off of
47:00 the ball if it's an anomaly in his
47:03 camera or if it's atmospheric distortion
47:05 that's just the mohawks not gonna stay
47:08 in the same spot it's gonna move all
47:09 around you do see that too but then when
47:13 you look at the plasma energy that moves
47:14 around some of these balls again if it's
47:16 contoured you can see it follow a
47:19 spherical shape like it's some light
47:23 bulb in space it's just burning plasma
47:25 around the outside it create the
47:27 illusion of stars for us you know and of
47:30 course there's the balls that fall from
47:31 space that no one's ever explained look
47:35 up Vietnam balls from space Spears from
47:40 space but blow your mind no one's
47:42 claimed ownership for these things how
47:45 simple would that be except there's a
47:47 liability of someone could have get
47:48 plastered by one of them look something
47:49 look like fiberglass some look like
47:53 steel mines that should be in the ocean
47:56 I don't know man
47:57 that could be they seem pretty small so
48:01 mmm
48:01 no there's no fuel residue there's
48:05 definitely burning on the outside some
48:07 of these things so for me it's just not
48:10 sexy it's just I don't want to watch a
48:11 UFO show or the only evidence they have
48:14 that they exist is we prayed over some
48:17 tombstones then all sudden these balls
48:19 of light showed up I saw that with the
48:21 scoober ever had either okay they're the
48:25 second tiers of the argument is okay so
48:29 what you're saying in these
48:31 documentaries is that you need 20 people
48:34 together you all vibrate towards the
48:36 aliens you say we accept you we love you
48:38 please you know show us that you exist
48:40 and they're willing to show up and
48:43 they're able to listen to you
48:45 spiritually it's not much of a stretch
48:47 and these balls start showing up but
48:50 everyone's I call my god there they are
48:53 okay
48:54 why don't they land why wouldn't they
48:59 land even if they are nothing more than
49:03 spiritual Souls but they look like balls
49:06 of light well very easily you can you
49:10 can talk to a ball of light I'll tell
49:12 you how what do you need to have a
49:15 conversation at minimum you need a
49:18 binary system yes no you could even
49:23 establish a maybe or I don't know take
49:27 the diamond that's in a baseball field
49:31 first base second base third base home
49:33 plate so they're hearing you right
49:37 that's the theory they're hearing you
49:39 and they're showing up so you will them
49:42 down you say please come to us and talk
49:44 to us just come down to us you don't
49:47 need to get out your spacecraft or maybe
49:49 you don't need maybe you're not a
49:50 spacecraft maybe you are just pure light
49:52 and so you establish just a basic
49:55 communication maybe even build this
49:56 thing in the desert first base is yes
50:03 third base is no second base is maybe
50:10 and home plate is I don't know and then
50:13 you just ask you questions are you from
50:17 another planet and then it's like yes no
50:21 like whatever it wants to do it just
50:23 hovers and where it hovers and maybe
50:25 home plate or sorry pitcher's mound is
50:27 the please ask me another question
50:29 there you go you have a full
50:31 communication capability with an
50:34 apparition the other thing is is that we
50:37 all are gonna measure from this point
50:39 forward for the people listen to this
50:41 show and people who would listen to the
50:44 show if they could find it they know
50:48 about the fake alien invasion SIOP
50:52 but again according to von Braun's
50:54 secretary von Braun told her they're
50:57 planning it from the 70s up I mean
51:01 seriously
51:02 they were so rewarded for their hoax he
51:05 moon landings then why wouldn't you
51:08 think of that why wouldn't you think of
51:09 a million other things to which they
51:11 have frame I continually try to think
51:15 about you know the it's sort of the
51:23 threshold thought process that an alien
51:26 race would have or a realization or a
51:31 set of qualifications that would have to
51:34 be satisfied for them to cross the
51:37 threshold of first contact now some of
51:41 us believe that they've done it maybe
51:43 inadvertently of Roswell maybe as a
51:47 result of capturing one of them from
51:49 Roswell perhaps there was more you know
51:52 instigated Close Encounters of the Third
51:55 Kind I don't know about you but once you
52:00 see Close Encounters of the Third Kind
52:01 by Steven Spielberg which I believe was
52:03 1978 once you see that movie where they
52:08 met a mothership after dealing with a
52:12 bunch of the sub ships and just flying
52:15 around people saw them there was like a
52:17 red light was one of them and then there
52:19 were some again cone-shaped ice cream
52:22 shaped things that were flying around
52:23 beautiful work on these alien spaceships
52:26 it was just perfect but then they make
52:30 enough contact they listen to the song
52:32 the songs are GPS coordinates
52:34 it's devil's eye Devils Tower excuse me
52:37 and so they create the fake fake
52:39 quarantine get everyone away from it
52:43 but people are possessed by what they
52:45 saw so Richard Dreyfuss said this woman
52:47 and a few other people gravitate towards
52:50 the location because they've been
52:51 programmed to come the woman's child was
52:55 abducted by them at the beginning the
52:57 movie and they all see this thing that
53:00 one's in the you know Richard Dreyfuss
53:01 and the woman make it everyone else
53:03 doesn't make it military's there
53:05 big mothership shows up drops off a
53:07 bunch of people they've abducted out of
53:09 Bermuda Triangle it's just so brilliant
53:11 I mean god damn that script was was a
53:14 golden ticket in a candy bar man and
53:17 then in the end Dreyfus goes into the
53:20 ship and leaves with them in this team
53:23 of people dressed in these red outfits
53:25 who have a little suitcase in there
53:27 they're just supposed to go figure out
53:29 what's there you know part of me can't
53:34 shake the notion that this was a true
53:38 story or based on a true story it's a
53:41 romantic idea it just seems like you
53:46 know area 51 which actually isn't a
53:50 really great spot to do this because
53:51 area 51 is observable from the
53:54 surrounding area and so you couldn't
53:57 have a massive ship especially like the
54:00 size of the one that was at Devils Tower
54:03 what's funny about it is I forgot they
54:06 said there was a diameter they wanted to
54:09 clear all the humans out from around
54:10 that location I don't know how many
54:13 miles it was but most of us that realize
54:17 that the curvature of the earth is not
54:20 quite as pronounced as scientists say
54:22 this ship was bigger than Devil's Tower
54:25 and so you know the romantic ending is
54:29 that it takes off and there's the shot
54:31 on Devil's Tower and then of course the
54:33 spaceship comes up behind Devil's Tower
54:35 which is further away and it's bigger
54:36 than Devils Tower all right it's got all
54:38 these spikes on it and with little
54:40 lights on the ends and you know cities
54:41 up in there and it's just a brilliant
54:43 prop right but my question would be you
54:47 know if you rewind Roswell I won't go
54:51 into a deeply but again I went in to
54:53 prove it wrong and I was like totally
54:55 convinced it happened and I must have
54:58 watched 30 Super long interviews with
55:02 people that were part of the town not
55:05 part of the military necessarily a
55:07 couple that were part of military but
55:09 their stories all held up over 40 years
55:11 men which is now geez
55:14 80 years not quite 80 but
55:18 suddenly at least right the video
55:20 reviews had happened over several
55:22 decades in anyway so you have a ship
55:28 that crashes and again the aliens
55:29 supposedly told the military dude don't
55:31 worry no one was coming well if there
55:34 was anything else apparently that
55:36 wouldn't be true but I also can't shake
55:41 the fact that this woman Laura
55:44 Eisenhower the granddaughter of Ike the
55:47 president from Chanute I mean from
55:49 Kansas scuse me
55:50 she just blatantly says that aliens were
55:57 a big part of her father or
55:58 grandfather's I guess she would call it
56:02 foreign policy but he he was dealing
56:06 with I think she said something like
56:08 four species there was a lot there was a
56:14 drop on what was a chin my guy called
56:18 himself our who said that Kennedy had to
56:22 deal with it as well
56:23 well Flora's telling the truth then
56:26 Kennedy would definitely have inherited
56:28 that communication issue all right this
56:34 also negates a lot of the Planet X stuff
56:36 because according to Planet X people who
56:39 are channeling aliens from planet Nibiru
56:43 they only get a chance like once every
56:45 epoch
56:46 I mean it's like thousands of years
56:48 before they get the chance to revisit
56:50 because their plan it's not close enough
56:52 for them to use their spaceships to get
56:53 to us to then genetically engineer us
56:55 and also their stuff boy would that be a
56:58 different visit this time around
56:59 wouldn't it but and I'm looking at this
57:04 woman just look her up she has a channel
57:06 Laura Eisenhower I think it's LA
57:10 ura so you know everyone has one of
57:15 those relatives that's sort of on the
57:18 black sheep list of being kind of crazy
57:20 at least the public thinks that those
57:23 people exist some people are demonized
57:26 into those containers
57:29 but you know if this was true let's just
57:36 take her to face value let's look at the
57:37 logistics that would have created this
57:39 moment where she just blatantly says
57:41 that her grandfather dealt with aliens
57:43 and again there's all these old guys
57:45 that are part of project disclosure from
57:47 Steven Greer's project that say that
57:49 this is exactly what happened that uh I
57:52 believe it was I think it was Eisenhower
57:56 or Truman Truman's like a decade earlier
57:59 right Truman was the president when
58:02 Roswell happens right but I think it was
58:05 Ike that said that he had one of his
58:08 minions got interviewed with this oxygen
58:10 tube and he's in a hotel very street
58:13 British story but the guy says to the
58:15 camera he's like yeah I was this dude
58:17 and he talks about all was rank and now
58:19 he got Q clearance and that he was sent
58:22 by the president because no presidents
58:25 allowed to go to area 51
58:27 what's up with that I mean how could you
58:30 even put up with that I mean if I was
58:32 president I I take it I'd have Air Force
58:36 one fueled up ready to go military
58:39 Secret Service can just go to the side
58:42 military escort right hold a press
58:45 conference to say I am flying to area 51
58:48 I'm taking a squadron of fighter pilots
58:52 the best top guns in the world all
58:55 psychologically vetted all in this to
58:58 win this and we're gonna land in 51
59:00 we're gonna stream the whole event and
59:02 here we go and then just see if they
59:05 can't clean that place up in the time it
59:06 takes me to get there but I would start
59:08 from maybe Phoenix Arizona so the
59:10 flights about 20 minutes or five minutes
59:13 or whatever right clear that up real
59:15 quick
59:16 commander-in-chief as commander-in-chief
59:17 baby but Eisenhower's granddaughter
59:22 would have been raised with this
59:25 knowledge as if it is nothing yeah
59:29 grandpa had to deal with a bunch of
59:30 aliens but we don't want to talk about
59:31 that
59:32 why well these intelligence people will
59:34 kill you so now it's 2020 her
59:37 grandfather's been dead for a long time
59:40 even her parents are
59:41 or not so worried about it anymore or
59:45 maybe they still are but she isn't
59:46 anymore so she gets on YouTube and says
59:48 it well at this point it's pretty easy
59:50 just to say she's crazy but why would
59:55 you know put yourself in her shoes let's
60:00 say it's a lie
60:01 so you would be a grandson or
60:05 granddaughter of a president you have an
60:08 agenda I guess and so you get on YouTube
60:11 maybe she could be part of this whole
60:13 fake alien invasion thing I guess like
60:17 what do you guys waiting for let's let's
60:18 do something different than this
60:20 lockdown the universe thing but then she
60:23 says this what would be the end
60:27 objective if everything she was saying
60:29 was completely fake and she knew it was
60:30 fake to make yourself look crazy online
60:34 I mean I'm a pretty good story writer I
60:38 could probably rehearse you know one of
60:41 my stories and I could tell you guys an
60:43 episode which makes up a bunch of stuff
60:45 that never happened and then okay I told
60:48 a big bold-faced lie which now I have to
60:50 remember right because if I got any
60:52 details wrong and you guys believe me
60:54 and then you cult a fyah round my house
60:56 or whatever and yeah Oh tell us about
60:59 the whatever aliens from outer space
61:01 you're our guy you're gonna save the
61:03 universe because they seem to like you
61:05 and they're all gonna oh my god the
61:07 burden of continuing to tell a lie of
61:09 that magnitude that's why lying sucks I
61:12 mean it's like I have no patience to the
61:15 truth is hard enough to remember and
61:16 find in the first place so this woman's
61:20 out there I don't know good Minnie Harry
61:23 Caray with her life or maybe she is
61:25 totally bona fide nuts but she said it
61:28 in such a matter-of-fact way it blew my
61:30 mind so I'm having a problem shaking
61:33 this notion with the are dude talked
61:38 about the greys and so the Kennedy knew
61:41 about them and the greys and their
61:44 agenda helm some people said he doesn't
61:46 mean aliens he means gray operatives all
61:50 right would have been nice to clarify
61:52 that in a little message it's just some
61:54 BS
61:55 post on each ant putting a validity to
61:58 it but it's interesting to hear the
62:00 archetype of the story evolve change
62:03 reposition itself meaning most
62:07 storylines didn't position themselves
62:09 within the white house
62:11 Whitley streamers book majestic
62:13 positioned the whole thing in the White
62:14 House for Truman and that he was
62:17 notified about Roswell of course he's
62:19 not a lot of see anything
62:21 called taking the wright-patterson Air
62:22 Force Base in the end and I guess he
62:26 just you know he supposedly took the
62:29 because of the OSS turned into the CIA
62:34 and that was all to investigate the
62:37 disappearance of Americans through alien
62:40 abduction there's that dude out there
62:43 I've talked about in the past who's the
62:46 psychologist from I think New York City
62:48 and supposedly he is a therapist
62:52 specifically for abductees and you
62:56 listen to his stories and according this
62:57 guy people are abducted constantly
62:59 around the world and I mean New York
63:01 City alone is got apartments full of
63:03 aliens and they're you know they're
63:05 holding a you know humans captive and
63:08 they make humans go out and get stuff
63:10 for them I mean my god the stories are
63:13 all over the place
63:14 so as we globalize communication through
63:21 the internet we had old stories kind of
63:23 get vetted and retired and new stories
63:27 evolved and it just seems sort of like
63:33 if you overlay the attention span of
63:37 mankind the average ability for man to
63:41 come up with new storylines that are
63:44 kind of modifications of obviously
63:45 previous stories you have this thing
63:50 that's kind of like Hollywood overlaying
63:52 on top of the UF ology groups or maybe
63:56 even in a at a brute force way music
63:59 every decade usually births a new
64:03 archetype story now a bunch of us are
64:07 obviously really
64:09 sort of fed up with Holly well it's not
64:13 Hollywood's fault in one way that the
64:14 stories we read out were in a record
64:16 piece of telling stories right
64:18 he kept Hollywood you've got Netflix
64:21 Amazon HBO Apple's getting into the game
64:26 so we have Hulu all these groups are
64:28 trying to fund new stories that are
64:31 gonna be gripping and so when they bump
64:33 into a Westworld you know based off they
64:37 would like a Crichton book slash movie
64:39 when something grabs the audience you
64:42 know what a west whirlwind like so I'm
64:45 like 10 to 15 Emmys I mean the show just
64:48 blew up right they hang on to it they
64:51 massage it they pay people tremendous
64:53 amounts money to come up with a season 2
64:57 season 3 and we all show up because
64:59 we're bored to death and so with the
65:04 alien conversation as I've noted several
65:06 times you know we we exhaust the story
65:10 of the greys about the end of the 80s
65:12 beginning of the 90s the gray thing had
65:15 been beautifully exploited by Whitley
65:18 Strieber I mean you have to give this
65:20 guy credit
65:21 he created very entertaining franchise
65:24 it's three books plus majestic then he
65:27 started touring ufology groups and just
65:29 outwardly saying you know I've been
65:30 abducted the billion times
65:32 he's always anally raped mm-hmm
65:35 and then what was the next trend the
65:41 next trend was David Ickes thing the
65:43 reptilian aliens and now all the sudden
65:45 you get not only a newly alien species
65:49 which is reptilian which has been in you
65:52 know Illustrated and I mean what did
65:55 Captain Kirk fight up in Apple Valley
65:57 he found he's fought this lizard David
65:59 right
66:01 we had V the series out of late 70s
66:04 early 80s on TV or a reptilians were
66:07 hiding an alien or she's hiding in human
66:10 costumes right
66:11 with their little flatter this thing in
66:14 their promo poster but he blows that up
66:18 and now it's not only aliens but they
66:21 run the world and they are shape
66:22 changing into Queen Elizabeth and
66:25 everybody else that's bad in the room
66:27 and what's kind of funny about that is
66:30 the whole thing of people with the
66:34 internet you know 10-15 years ago there
66:38 were still people with really bad
66:39 internet connections and so you got a
66:41 lot of video artifacting and so you know
66:46 pupils turned into slits because of the
66:49 video artifacting was like oh my god
66:51 these people are shape changing right on
66:52 camera you had color patterns you know
66:55 not work and stuff and now that the
66:59 internet bandwidth is pretty much
67:00 solidified into high band you don't see
67:02 it anymore so you don't anymore claims
67:04 that stuff but I think a lot of people
67:06 follow David Icke with the full-blown
67:09 belief that within their lifetime they
67:12 were going to actually see a reptilian
67:14 alien well now we're sort of in a vacuum
67:19 we have meteorites coming in we have
67:23 that anomaly I talked about there's two
67:26 anomalies that are fairly interesting
67:27 that you don't know maybe it's like some
67:30 badass effects dude doing it but
67:36 again the meteorite that flew over
67:38 Russia had some alien spec that traveled
67:43 faster than the meteorite and when it
67:45 hit it it exploded now that doesn't make
67:50 any sense for me physically without it
67:52 being some propelled thing that any
67:54 entity would be able to go that much
67:56 faster than the original but maybe it's
67:59 a like a nascar thing where a big rock
68:03 behind it was drafting it so the big big
68:06 rock is knocking all the oxygen out the
68:08 way so this other one is coming in at
68:09 its original speed and it's literally
68:11 flying in the cone of the draft that
68:14 this big ones causing and then it does
68:15 impact the core and because maybe it's
68:18 not really held together that well
68:20 that's when we got the huge explosion
68:21 all the windows are blowed out probably
68:24 about ten years ago if not 12 years ago
68:26 there was a video of a chem trail that
68:28 was laid in the sky bright blue day and
68:32 you saw this like little white speck and
68:35 I mean it's a speck in the video and
68:37 it's doing these fly throughs on the
68:40 chem trail and the chem trail was
68:43 erasing and itself everywhere this
68:48 little speck went like it was an alien
68:50 trying to erase a poison in the sky as
68:54 the story line with it I think that as
68:58 the suffering on earth continues and
69:01 perhaps grows in a exponential way here
69:07 it's just crazy man this era we're in is
69:11 nuts it is nuts which is why you know we
69:16 got a fight this place back to normal
69:18 way beyond you got to fight it back to
69:21 like 1999 levels okay but it's going to
69:25 become a very popular story that aliens
69:29 are coming and we sort of want it to
69:32 happen so what's gonna make these aliens
69:35 step off show up do something
69:41 because imagine if it's a fake alien
69:43 invasion all it's gonna be as a light
69:45 show in the sky and if we're satisfied
69:47 with balls of lighting in the sky during
69:50 the day or whatever and they fly
69:51 intelligently and whatever man if that's
69:54 gonna make you change your life I don't
69:56 know what else of you there's probably a
69:57 lot of low-hanging fruit that would make
69:59 you change your life here's the thing
70:02 though putting ourselves back in David
70:05 Greer's movies and he's not the only one
70:09 that this notion that we can all
70:11 meditate in the desert and then we see
70:13 lights okay let's say you and I and the
70:18 group and the crew from deep thoughts
70:21 will go out we agree to meet in some
70:23 remote location and we do it and it
70:27 works it totally works we know we're not
70:31 part of any intelligence group we don't
70:33 have you know the military or some deep
70:36 state thing throwing lights up there to
70:38 keep us all satisfied we're not hiring
70:41 people to do you know soundless drones
70:45 flying in the sky and so if it happened
70:48 let's just let's just take it at face
70:50 value it happens to us hell it happens
70:53 to one of us how much would that change
70:56 your life I'm tricking you a little bit
70:59 here because the answer is it would
71:01 totally and utterly change us because we
71:06 would have seen the fact that just
71:09 meditating towards them brings them to
71:11 earth or lets them reveal themselves
71:13 they're already here or whatever
71:15 wouldn't you do it the next day and the
71:17 next day and the next day the next would
71:19 you care about your job when we turn
71:20 into Richard Dreyfuss where he just went
71:22 batshit crazy in the movie he got fired
71:25 from his job and then he built a Devil's
71:28 Tower in his living room after building
71:30 it out of potatoes and a clay model for
71:32 his kids train said I think we'd go nuts
71:36 we'd be happy because we think we'd be
71:39 advancing the communication the other
71:44 thing is let's take because Greer always
71:49 presents himself in his own movies of
71:52 course and he's narrating ideas and Khan
71:55 which is very valuable to our brains
71:56 right regardless if it's true or false
71:58 it's just what I do right but now let's
72:02 say that let's say there's six of you
72:06 plus me seven and we do this there's
72:12 like 30 of us but only 7 of us feel
72:14 comfortable talking to the press about
72:16 it and we shoot footage and we make our
72:20 own little short film proving what we
72:22 saw but we have as much money as Greer
72:26 to shoot this thing at some massive
72:28 level because his I'll just tell you
72:31 like when they interviewed Syd Mead a
72:33 buddy of mine who made his documentary
72:34 Joaquin he also shot this other thing of
72:38 Syd in his living which is the best
72:39 footage of Syd you've ever seen in your
72:41 life he said that the the bill for seven
72:46 minutes with this massive Hollywood
72:49 cinematographer hooked up all the light
72:51 perfect and just it's beautiful footage
72:53 man
72:55 it's about 25 grand for this little tiny
72:58 seven minute production and that's most
73:01 of the time volunteered for free I think
73:04 that if we sat on a chair talking to a
73:07 camera after willing elion to show up
73:12 one of us would say we saw aliens men we
73:17 went out to a desert a random desert
73:21 not known for aliens we prayed towards
73:26 them I guess you could say meditated
73:27 towards them wish them no harm wish them
73:30 to come to us and communicate with us
73:33 and they showed up even if they didn't
73:34 get out of their spacecraft they were
73:36 nothing more than lights
73:38 there'd be some point in the dialogue or
73:40 like we saw this man this totally and
73:43 utterly happened and this is not us
73:45 lying we're not this is why we did it
73:47 because we couldn't trust anyone else's
73:49 footage everyone else has got some weird
73:52 relationship with an intelligence agency
73:53 we wanted to do it just straight up all
73:56 the cart I have never heard Grier say
74:00 that and so for me it's like it's like
74:04 Greer has never said it that way like
74:08 he's never blown away by the fact he saw
74:11 these things so for me because of that I
74:15 think it's very orchestrated it just
74:19 seems to lack the emotion that would be
74:20 the case like a bunch sitting here right
74:22 here
74:24 I was probably about 20 feet between me
74:27 and the fence in front of me and I look
74:30 up in the sky right there I'm talking
74:32 about him right now but I talked at
74:34 least an hour by now these are my
74:36 footage and they showed up right there
74:39 in front of me dancing around you would
74:42 see a version of me you've never seen
74:45 before
74:45 you would hear me be giddy amazed blown
74:50 away I'd be talking a million miles a
74:52 minute to describe it I turn the camera
74:54 around to film it I'd grab this mic off
74:57 the freaking stand and just sat there
74:59 sit there and narrate the whole thing I
75:02 would be blown away and then let's say
75:09 others again ten of you that totally
75:11 believed me and no matter where you are
75:13 in this world no matter for quarantine
75:15 or not you get in that station wagon and
75:17 you get your ass here now we're gonna do
75:19 it again you're all in the patio I say
75:22 we look that way and then it happens
75:25 again I'm not gonna be less amazed the
75:29 second time right these are aliens from
75:32 another place I don't care if they're
75:35 interdimensional then our planetary
75:39 different universe still blown away so
75:45 let's take a 90 degree turn with the
75:50 entire thing I'm talking about here why
75:56 is it that even I have to do a show to
76:00 open my mind to look at this thing in a
76:03 more logical way I do it all the time
76:07 right we talk about a subject that
76:09 everyone's accepting in one particular
76:10 way then I started smoking a cigar I'm
76:13 sitting here I've got no input just this
76:15 little tiny screen I stare at to make
76:17 sure I'm in the shot
76:19 I don't take any drugs before I do this
76:22 right in the tobacco and I've been
76:28 asking myself you know my wisest why is
76:30 there a trend why when I'm in the house
76:33 I have epiphanies in the house for sure
76:35 but I have less in there and I
76:38 especially have I think I think I have
76:43 instinctual pings when I'm in the house
76:45 and I'm watching the actual video on a
76:47 strobing screen an alpha inducing screen
76:52 it's as if I am being put into a
76:55 paralysis state mentally to some degree
76:59 that I lack logical thinking until I
77:02 turn the screen off because I have a
77:05 pretty strong memory I sit there and
77:07 think about it and think about it and
77:09 think about it it could be that this
77:12 mechanism by which we're ingesting this
77:14 stuff is keeping us from having those
77:16 advanced thoughts of analysis to look at
77:22 what we are seeing we're feeling it
77:24 subconsciously for sure like again if I
77:27 watch another UFO it's just the balls of
77:32 light and space or in the sky don't give
77:34 a [ __ ] if it's day or night doesn't
77:35 matter to me I have so little interest
77:39 his trailer which outside of what looks
77:42 like a very CG triangle with three
77:44 lights flying off in the distance and
77:46 rotating on a site I mean I sit in
77:48 Lightwave all day long
77:49 modeling 3d stuff and doing effects it
77:53 just seems like oh okay I mean it could
77:55 be real but it could also be super fake
77:58 and then he has a bunch of these ball
78:00 lights on ball light flying through a
78:02 forest I mean it's interesting again if
78:08 I was there you know and it was really
78:10 happening and I know it's really
78:11 happening
78:12 I still be skeptical a little bit that
78:14 someone's playing with us there's some
78:15 vehicle and they're just doing a test to
78:18 see if we're gonna I don't know fly off
78:20 the handle or whatever but when you get
78:23 away from the screen it's when your
78:25 brain rehabilitates goes back to normal
78:29 your frontal lobes are fully operational
78:31 you
78:32 have discernment and that's when the
78:35 logic appears and then you start to
78:38 wonder like oh no wonder we believed
78:40 everything on the day of 9/11 I just had
78:43 a friend call me tonight she said I
78:46 can't believe that anyone believed 9/11
78:51 when it happened
78:52 and coming from a female that is just
78:54 that's a big step I mean most you guys
78:57 know in a week female is the sexiest
79:00 thing on planet Earth and she I said
79:03 well tell me what you're thinking and
79:04 she says well I just went to architects
79:07 and engineers for 9/11 truth now what
79:11 she was talking about initially was
79:12 building seven she's like that thing was
79:14 so imploded it's obvious like yeah it is
79:19 obvious isn't it
79:20 and I said anyone who studies basic
79:22 physics looks at the other two towers
79:24 you know doing the banana peel all the
79:26 way down you know you're seeing
79:28 explosive spin you don't you don't drop
79:32 the cigar and then it falls and it goes
79:35 you know eight feet that way and
79:36 atomizes into dust it just nothing's
79:38 ever done that a lot in life you've
79:40 never knocked a glass off of a table top
79:43 and it breaks in midair and atomizes
79:45 before it's the ground they all you have
79:47 us like dust of glass on the ground it's
79:49 never happened before but we buy it
79:52 because potentially there's a lot of
79:55 things going on in that day because
79:58 there's you know for those of you study
80:00 Judy Wood and the directed-energy weapon
80:04 evidence which is pretty overwhelming
80:07 what we also have to remember is the the
80:11 EMF wave thing were worried about with
80:13 5g now obviously there's nothing like 5g
80:17 on the ground during 9/11 was barely
80:21 only 3G didn't even exist and so but if
80:27 you have a metropolitan area Los Angeles
80:30 San Francisco New York Chicago Dallas
80:34 whatever they could strategically get a
80:38 bunch of people on board especially New
80:40 York the witnesses of all this stuff you
80:42 just hit them with the wave and who
80:45 knows how much
80:46 until control they might have on you and
80:49 maybe they just make you super
80:51 susceptible to the press who knows now
80:56 let's let's go to a real alien
81:00 visitation slash first contact instead
81:03 of the fake alien invasion
81:06 I mean what's crazy about it right now
81:08 is if you think about it logically for
81:10 one second we are all in the awake group
81:13 pre-programmed to assume that if there's
81:16 any type of alien contact storyline in
81:20 this probably at least this decade of
81:25 2022 2029 we're gonna assume it's fake
81:29 but now wouldn't it suck if the real
81:33 ones showed up and here we are going
81:36 yeah you're not real you know they're
81:37 like Klaatu Barada nikto and all those
81:39 other stuff and we're like you know
81:41 we're we're not benefiting from their
81:43 visit because we're trying to call them
81:46 fake in our minds but they're actually
81:48 real
81:49 it would just be bad timing on their
81:51 part right and you know just
81:56 cannibalizing a little bit of my alien
81:58 promise episode which probably a lot of
81:59 you haven't seen so my favorite episodes
82:02 ever did you know what would be their
82:06 objective besides just saying hi we're
82:09 here you're a member of a much larger
82:13 group just like Star Trek did back in
82:15 the day there's a galactic group and our
82:19 quadrant of the galaxy which one thing I
82:24 love about Star Trek is they made the
82:26 galaxy so gigantic that by the time they
82:28 wanted to kick off the most incredible
82:31 Voyager series they were in a different
82:34 quadrant that Delta Quadrant and so they
82:37 made it so big that they had just they
82:39 had two quadrants that they had never
82:40 touched I don't think the whole story
82:41 and so you know there was one episode
82:46 where they visited like a god type
82:48 character in the first season I'm sorry
82:51 for show next generation but you know
82:54 there's the human desire and then
82:58 there's their design
82:59 then there's the ruling class of our
83:02 world desires so if this thing was real
83:05 and let's just say that they had through
83:10 millions of years of evolution as
83:12 claimed by at least the military guy
83:16 that took care of the alien during
83:18 Roswell for a very short bit where he
83:21 got the two pieces of communication
83:24 which is well one the overwhelming
83:27 melancholy sadness that the little
83:29 character had and then he said that I
83:32 fully accept the fact that I'm here and
83:34 I'm never going home and don't worry no
83:36 one's coming to rescue us those were the
83:39 two messages he said and this guy's
83:41 nearly crying in the desert at like 75
83:44 years old 30-some years for 40 or some
83:47 years after the event occurred I mean so
83:50 it was very very compelling video I mean
83:54 the guy had written a book about ten
83:56 years before that but he wasn't like
83:58 whoo-hoo-hoo and then he's like by my
84:00 book you know he wasn't doing anything
84:01 like that at all so if they had
84:04 telepathic communication on even the
84:06 most basic scale which all you needs a
84:08 language to figure out what the hell we
84:10 want and they showed up and they see
84:14 especially today they see a world locked
84:18 down for some scam Demick and they're
84:20 like oh my god these people are all in a
84:23 suffering situation their economic
84:25 system of of existing their money
84:27 systems completely destroyed by the way
84:32 the the theory is that the oil barrel
84:36 has crashed to force the hand of
84:40 government to create a gold-backed
84:44 currency which will most likely be
84:47 digital and it ain't gonna be called
84:50 Bitcoin unfortunately but they see our
84:53 suffering and then they can probably
84:58 easily deduce because all they have to
85:00 do is have a conversation or it
85:01 mentioned they read one of our minds
85:03 they're like Oh George Soros bill gates
85:05 round child´s Windsor's okay I see the
85:09 picture
85:10 we got some cleaning up to do I've got
85:14 some teleportations to do and then we're
85:17 gonna restore this planet and we're
85:20 gonna restore these people and you know
85:24 what they all seem to want 99.9999% of
85:28 this planet they want peace they want
85:33 poverty to be eliminated they don't
85:37 really want to have to earn a wage but
85:39 they want to work except some of these
85:42 snowflakes but we'll bring them around
85:45 maybe you got a moon for those guys
85:49 so it depends if intelligence is
85:55 synonymous with empathy one would think
85:59 it does now streamers whole approach on
86:02 the greys was that they were very non
86:04 empathetic and that they just did what
86:06 they wanted to and that they were
86:07 minions of another race some people say
86:11 they're fallen angels people say they're
86:12 falling demons you know I would never
86:15 take it to that point anything could be
86:17 a demon or an angel right you're pulled
86:20 over on the side of the road because you
86:21 ran out of gas in your middle of the
86:22 desert between Los Angeles and Vegas if
86:25 I just happen to get you a gallon of gas
86:26 to get to the next gas station I'm gonna
86:28 be an angel if I charge your hundred
86:31 bucks for that gallon of gas I'll be a
86:33 demon so you know what would happen just
86:40 as a scenario if the ruling class
86:45 obviously would have eyes on space even
86:48 if they don't have satellites they would
86:50 be able to see it from the ground here
86:52 comes some mother ships here come some
86:54 other ships out of the mother ships it
86:57 you know you would assume an invasion
86:59 until you heard something nice
87:00 maybe they interrupt communication and
87:02 send a message to us and say
87:04 everything's gonna be fine whilst not
87:05 gonna trust it because we've seen the
87:06 Twilight Zone episode to serve man but
87:10 to agree they continually perform well
87:13 solve problems you know
87:17 the thing is even if they wanted to take
87:19 over the world they're not gonna want to
87:22 answer to any of the current leadership
87:24 so they're just gonna wipe them off the
87:25 planet
87:26 you know disable them at least one way
87:30 or another like yeah yeah you guys shut
87:32 up you've been hurting your people for a
87:34 long time or we're taking over we're
87:35 gonna hurt your people so you're out of
87:37 here it's either way the leadership of
87:39 the world is would react right and so
87:42 then we would find probably some
87:46 weaponized Sun weapon jury that we've
87:49 never seen before right [ __ ] they've
87:50 been hiding - I don't use plasma cannons
87:53 or whatever those silo Pleasant clouds
87:56 my cannons I was telling you guys about
87:58 maybe have some of their own
88:00 anti-gravity ships you know where they
88:02 really try to
88:03 pick a fight with an alien culture you
88:07 know it's it should be assumed that if
88:10 anyone can travel the stars that they
88:13 have amazing power if they're dumb
88:16 owners well then just step aside right
88:18 because you're not gonna have any
88:19 control and then sort of where does it
88:23 start
88:24 what if in the next second of your life
88:26 every leader that you ever thought was
88:29 doing you harm all the Warlord's the
88:32 presidents the Chancellor's all these
88:34 agenda21
88:36 douchebags --use gone
88:39 Trudeau's gone everybody's deep Staters
88:42 are history okay so they're all gone
88:45 next second boom everyone's gone now
88:48 we're just here on this planet
88:50 now what mm-hmm
88:54 let's see we would have to take over all
88:59 of the systems that keep us going with
89:01 our current thinking right because we're
89:03 stuck in paradigms of thinking there's
89:06 no paradigm of thought that select I'm
89:08 just gonna go to Walgreens and grab food
89:11 there's no more money I'm just going to
89:13 take it what people gonna be panicking
89:16 we saw a [ __ ] toilet paper fall off
89:18 the shelves give me a break
89:20 if the total paper thing is such a
89:22 disappointing situation isn't it it just
89:26 shows that a very small group of people
89:32 can [ __ ] it up for everybody else right
89:36 I'm gonna go buy up all the [ __ ]
89:39 toilet paper out of all these places I
89:40 mean my Walgreens finally gets a
89:42 shipment everyone some others like this
89:44 palette that's in the front limit one
89:46 per customer there's four rolls in each
89:48 one it's septic tank crap so it's like
89:50 kind of trying to wipe your butt with
89:53 you know a gust of wind so unless these
89:58 folks have like magical jelly beans that
90:01 grow on the ground and great giant bean
90:03 stalks of food that everybody can grab
90:04 off some willy wonka tree
90:08 even the best-laid plans would be very
90:11 difficult you know and I would it be
90:14 assuming that I'm just riffing here for
90:18 a story you know we've seen many many
90:22 many movies from Gush at least the 50s
90:27 up all the X minus one episodes had a
90:30 2000 plus had it that they would be
90:33 studying our communications from space
90:35 learn our language learn all the
90:36 situations learn who these folks are and
90:39 probably in the dead of night get rid of
90:41 all the bad folks if that's where they
90:42 the route they were gonna go you know if
90:44 it's a takeover where they're gonna run
90:46 the place and we won't necessarily like
90:47 it like the Nibiru Planet X story but
90:52 you know dead people are no use to you
90:54 so unless you want to take over the
90:55 planet which seems like a I mean are we
90:58 really that unique in the universe that
91:00 that's keep it sad own we know there's
91:02 nothing it's got on the outside and
91:03 there's nothing else right but that what
91:09 they bring food and you know a whole new
91:13 paradigm where they use our
91:14 communication systems to let us know
91:16 what's going on would they hire some of
91:17 us to be their ambassadors to talk on
91:20 their behalf to go we'd have to go get
91:22 briefed and understand the the plan and
91:25 ask a million questions and then ask
91:27 another million questions and then find
91:29 out where we're gonna like who's gonna
91:31 address the United States who's gonna
91:33 address Europe and their each individual
91:35 country all around the world so they can
91:37 feel like someone so we can feel like
91:39 someone from our area is as our best
91:44 interests in mind you know but you know
91:48 it raises the question of and this
91:51 happens to us all the time have you ever
91:54 been in a public situation where you
92:00 notice someone needed help not a
92:02 homeless person necessarily although
92:05 there's some you know the Skid Row in LA
92:07 it would be difficult to help someone in
92:10 Skid Row because they're very suspicious
92:12 of everyone for for reasons that are
92:15 very understandable but you're in a
92:17 normal place you're again it will happen
92:21 like it
92:21 mall or something when there used to be
92:23 functioning really well and some like
92:26 I'm a guy right so some lady of any age
92:30 is carrying too much and she's dropping
92:33 [ __ ] and you know whatever and all you
92:35 want to do is go over and say can I help
92:37 you with that you know and it depends on
92:39 how you communicate with her especially
92:41 in a random place because parking lots
92:43 are known for abduction places as to
92:46 whether or not you're gonna freak this
92:48 woman out make her heart leap out of her
92:50 chest or whether or not she's gonna go
92:53 thank you thank you so much you know you
92:57 know you just you just say I'm right
92:59 here this is my car right here you just
93:01 try to dispel the situation from any
93:03 nefarious intent as quickly as possible
93:05 to say my car's right there I can help
93:09 you get to your car and then it's all
93:10 good you know you may even say like I'm
93:13 not a weirdo you know just say whatever
93:15 you got to say but we're human to human
93:17 here you know at night when I go to bed
93:21 one of my tricks for sort of
93:24 preoccupying my mind away from real life
93:31 because I find that if I fantasize about
93:33 something that doesn't exist I used to I
93:36 think I said this long time ago I used
93:38 to take a cartoon world's and I just
93:39 fall asleep it's really strange like a
93:42 rough Bakshi world or something cool
93:45 world right but you know sometimes I'll
93:49 think about what it would really be like
93:52 to have myself show up in a on alien
93:59 world it's fully civilized they have
94:03 buildings and vehicles and some people
94:05 walking outside some people riding in
94:07 vehicles
94:08 some people are eating dinner or
94:10 whatever and then you show up and - you
94:13 know you look different than them even
94:15 if it's like almost identical but maybe
94:18 their eyes are a little further apart
94:20 and they have like an extra limb or they
94:22 all have the same hair or whatever it is
94:24 and you show up and you
94:31 you have to assume that you would freak
94:33 them out on some level it wouldn't
94:38 matter if you showed up in a vehicle and
94:39 you did some you know Day the Earth
94:42 Stood Still thing and you'll and I
94:43 wanted their baseball fields and then
94:46 they'd gather around and they know that
94:47 someone's coming out and they know you
94:49 not from their planet and then you come
94:51 out and try to make peace how do you
94:53 write that dialogue as you would gain
94:56 their trust because they if they're
94:59 smart they have to wonder what you're
95:02 there for and so no matter how you run
95:05 the alien landing scenario in my mind I
95:09 mean I think that most of us are pretty
95:11 sophisticated on average ok well I've
95:16 done several episodes about what it's
95:17 like to truly meet an alien I have a
95:19 whole episode about meeting an alien and
95:21 we slow time down to like milliseconds
95:24 or your consciousness seeing something
95:27 you've never seen before
95:28 and what does that really mean to you I
95:30 mean maybe you're some Australian kid it
95:33 just threw a huge party and you've seen
95:36 a bunch of [ __ ] the night before and
95:37 it's like you're half stone anyway and
95:39 you're like dude what's up and I mean
95:42 alien you know maybe that's it right
95:44 crikey that probably the best scenario
95:47 to be honest but so we're out there you
95:50 know listening to it maybe it's a
95:52 distant thing they're talking over radio
95:53 we've seen them fly over and then u s--
95:55 again it's all Hollywood after that if
95:57 it's fake right so you put yourself in
96:01 their shoes they're trying to figure out
96:02 how to do first contact what do they do
96:04 in Star Trek again we owed Gene
96:07 Roddenberry so many thanks for the way
96:11 that he kicked off a franchise that
96:12 allowed us to analyze these algorithms
96:16 first contact was something introduced
96:19 in next generation and it went all the
96:22 way up to 2005 and enterprise right so
96:25 that's for series our four shows excuse
96:29 me and it was always typically in Star
96:34 Trek it was if it was a mistake it was a
96:37 mistake there's some of those episodes
96:38 as well but they would take you know the
96:43 mistake one I remember was they were
96:44 hiding in
96:45 an observatory in Iraq and the face was
96:49 actually open so they could see the
96:52 people down below was kind of a
96:53 primitive tribe and something went wrong
96:57 they tried to infiltrate the tribe
96:58 [Music]
97:00 seems like it's always Riker that gets
97:02 caught up in this thing but then it's
97:05 their spiritual mythos against reality
97:08 and eventually you had to take a woman
97:10 up to the ship and tour around of course
97:12 they show her freaking out very
97:14 beautifully done and then she's got to
97:16 go home and pitch something else and
97:20 gross data was involved too and he's an
97:21 Android it's all strange but others were
97:25 that the top scientist is two or three
97:27 episodes like this where the top
97:29 scientist for the government was a very
97:32 CCP kind of thing where it was like
97:34 there's a bunch of propaganda about the
97:37 beginning of their species and in one of
97:41 the episodes it was that they were
97:43 descendants of humans or we were
97:49 descendants of them or one of the other
97:50 and I think it was they were descendants
97:53 of us and that could be allowed in their
97:55 mythos of their culture and so they were
98:00 fighting it too they know the science
98:02 officer fought it and a couple episodes
98:03 they left it hanging and we're like you
98:05 know the bad side one for the temporary
98:10 situation that the episode ended in
98:12 these are all brilliantly done but if
98:16 we're truly going to analyze what it
98:19 would take to cross that barrier I think
98:21 that we all banked om and all we need is
98:24 like you know a million of them to show
98:27 up which sounds like a lot but that's a
98:29 tiny percentage of the Earth's
98:30 population but they got to show up they
98:32 gotta have some goodies and some big red
98:34 bag and then as long as we all benefit
98:38 quickly hey we're totally good with it
98:40 right you imagine that how easy would be
98:42 to take over Earth with the to serve man
98:46 thing what I think is fascinating about
98:49 this time in 2020 is that it's never
98:55 been easier to wake someone up and I was
98:58 just telling a friend of mine tonight I
99:00 that I have never seen the world so
99:02 awake ever at some point awake meaning
99:08 they don't have to know anything about Q
99:10 and ons whole thing which is a lot of
99:12 waking up
99:13 but maybe it's not real to the point of
99:16 just knowing Bill and Melinda Gates are
99:18 involved with Watchi and the other is it
99:22 bricks woman whatever name is bricks or
99:26 whatever name is with George Soros with
99:29 Harvard University with just a bunch of
99:31 nefarious money going around it's
99:33 developing this virus again we got the
99:36 patent from Google so when we talk about
99:41 outrageous circumstances like aliens
99:44 landing on earth now maybe 20 years ago
99:47 the only thing that would soften the
99:49 blow would be a raging Star Trek series
99:53 to be 30 years ago to get a really
99:55 raging one going and then or maybe a
99:58 movie that Steven Spielberg makes like
100:00 Close Encounters of the Third Kind
100:01 imagine if they had shown up in 1979
100:04 after Close Encounters before
100:08 well Star Wars would have been out as
100:09 well and so we're like I've seen the
100:12 cantina scene so I know it you know it's
100:14 what it's like to see an alien is shaped
100:16 really weird compared to human you know
100:19 anatomy and because Close Encounters
100:23 made all those aliens at least mostly
100:28 friendly they did steal a kid out of a
100:31 house for me just to loop back to
100:34 because I don't know if I ever made this
100:36 direct insinuation I think I did
100:38 we know that today the kids are a
100:43 commodity for a bunch of weird reasons
100:45 right adrenal chromes and a bunch of
100:46 other sacrificial things at decent
100:49 nutbags worship the Moloch group the
100:53 Abramovich group all of their stuff so
100:56 when I hear that these groups you know
101:02 CIA's converted in around 47 right
101:05 there's the Roswell thing and then
101:08 there's all this talk about people being
101:10 abducted especially children even out of
101:13 the womb of women and then we
101:17 fast-forward to today and you're like oh
101:19 so it wasn't really an alien story it
101:22 was a bunch of your crazy
101:24 ritual stuff and you're covering it with
101:27 abductions from aliens
101:29 how could being so we have to keep that
101:34 in mind as well then there's the age-old
101:37 question which is are these aliens
101:41 really there and are they waiting for us
101:44 to hit a level of maturity ourselves
101:48 before we before they come down and so
101:52 the threshold is not a technological
101:54 threshold of we you know like Star Trek
101:58 the Zefram Cochrane's storyline which is
102:00 so brilliant at warp which means you're
102:03 now capable of deep space travel and so
102:06 once you create warp your first warp
102:08 test is successful somebody's elected to
102:11 come down and say hello we got the
102:13 Vulcans and the Vulcans were played
102:16 beautifully all right they're not
102:17 emotional but they kind of are they're
102:19 always angry I think that's funny
102:20 so Star Trek has will in faux-pas with
102:23 the Vulcans is that they're always
102:25 pissed only Spock wasn't pissed but
102:28 everyone else was pissed constantly and
102:31 super sarcastic and demeaning which is
102:34 an emotion it's a technique but what if
102:37 it was a some form of consciousness that
102:40 we have to hit before they do they're
102:43 they're big hello okay so then the
102:46 question is how many of us have to be at
102:48 that level before they're willing to do
102:50 it if 75 million people is 1% of the
102:54 world population then that's a lot of
102:57 people 1% doesn't sound like that much
103:00 does it it's anything higher than that I
103:03 mean 75 million just think about trying
103:06 to get 75 million people on the same
103:07 page that's tough that sounds impossible
103:13 so it seems as if they wouldn't be they
103:19 wouldn't wait for such a thing now let's
103:22 say that they were as Laura Eisenhower
103:25 says they've been here for decades
103:27 and we know that all media's controlled
103:31 all television and movies are all
103:33 control the scripts re-written to
103:36 advance agendas and this and app then
103:40 maybe you know you would expect to see a
103:44 bunch of films and television if this
103:47 was a good thing like our governments
103:50 weren't totally against us and they
103:52 would be advancing this narrative about
103:54 how to make communication with an alien
103:56 you would assume that at least one show
104:00 would come out where it was like this is
104:02 who they are they are good and here's
104:07 something if not four or five different
104:09 things that you never thought about that
104:11 they want to give us with to serve man I
104:16 mean which is I don't know 1960 or
104:18 something like that
104:19 somewhere in that window with lurch
104:23 playing the alien dude right there whole
104:28 thing was to feed us you know come here
104:30 cure us all all of our diseases get rid
104:34 of poverty make you know crops as clean
104:37 as possible there's no GMO at the time
104:40 clean it all up everything's organic
104:43 everything's bumpin man you know
104:45 watermelons are like this big and
104:46 they're lush and amazing no seeds you
104:49 know and they're fat nice fattening is
104:52 stuff to ship us to their planets eat us
104:54 but we think we're going there to visit
104:58 you know the only way to get rid of that
105:00 narrative would be to say that you're
105:02 never gonna go our planet and we're not
105:04 going to put that many people down here
105:06 to eat you so don't worry about it you
105:07 know it has to be some agreement like
105:09 that but then yeah it'd be like human
105:14 beings negotiating with ants no we won't
105:16 hurt your little fort you got down there
105:18 and sorry about the rain we'll put a
105:21 little ball over your place to keep you
105:23 teased be okay so you don't die but any
105:27 moment we could just stomp you and you
105:29 be gone
105:31 so I think it would be something we
105:33 don't deal with in humanity anymore
105:35 because we have religion to protect the
105:37 family unit and to establish some laws
105:40 and then we turned them into government
105:41 laws but like my friend a long time ago
105:45 said it use religion was the birth of
105:47 the family because you couldn't have a
105:49 sanctity of marriage without rules to
105:53 keep the biggest guy in the village from
105:54 killing you and taking your wife the
105:58 sort of harem mentality that we used to
106:01 have which some places on earth still
106:03 have so imagine I was dealing with on a
106:06 daily basis what would be a really
106:11 confusing thing for the human mind it
106:13 would be a gray the you know the female
106:16 Gray's are supposedly which they're
106:18 beige they're tan and there are six feet
106:21 so a grown man will be steering this
106:25 female in the face and then the boys are
106:29 the bluish gray four-footers but imagine
106:35 that the females are you know a few and
106:38 far between maybe it's a present uh
106:42 matriarch matriarchal society but
106:47 imagine a bunch of human beings dealing
106:49 with smaller beings being utterly
106:51 superior to them and realizing that you
106:57 can't shake any at any point in time
107:00 this notion that they could destroy you
107:02 if they wanted to and that changes the
107:05 game that changes the game it would make
107:11 us behave
107:12 maybe this make us behave in a way that
107:14 is sort of good for us and sometimes it
107:17 might make us behave weird like that
107:19 Twilight Zone with the kid who wished
107:21 everyone into the cornfield you know
107:23 it's good that you did that it's good
107:24 that you wish it into the cornfield it's
107:26 like I'm like damn don't send me out
107:28 there let's see like today what's gonna
107:31 make him back because he would the the
107:33 beautiful thing about that episode of
107:35 Twilight Zone was that the kid would
107:40 change what he liked from day to day and
107:43 so you could wear
107:44 a particular shirt with a particular
107:46 color on a particular day you can listen
107:49 to music of a particular kind but he
107:51 would change his mind and all sudden you
107:53 going to do the same thing that work
107:54 yesterday and you're now violating his
107:58 daily swing be really interesting to to
108:05 make that into a movie
108:06 and then not only portray him as the
108:09 child that did all the things that he
108:11 did in the twilight zone but then
108:12 portray him as a pre-adolescent and then
108:15 an adult and then you know get to the
108:18 point where he's basically down to two
108:20 or three people who may be his parents
108:22 and then he grows up and finds out he's
108:26 been a devil his whole life and then see
108:28 if he doesn't try to reconstitute the
108:30 universe back into something better
108:32 great
108:33 anyway food for thought man it's every
108:38 time I think I'm sort of out of that
108:40 they're out of ammo for those storylines
108:43 and these these these trends of trains
108:47 of thought I guess you could call it
108:49 there's a bunch in there there's just so
108:52 much to analyze so much to think about
108:55 and I think that you know I think it
109:00 would be funny because you guys interact
109:01 to you know I'm just I'm the the first
109:05 guy that talks and then you guys are the
109:07 next people that talk and so be
109:11 interesting if this all occurred and we
109:14 were much better prepared to lead during
109:19 this phase of communicating with these
109:21 aliens because we've had an advance
109:23 conversation over and over and over
109:25 again about it I just see so many
109:28 unknowns that would throw us off you
109:31 know as much as you planned you know
109:35 it's just like a good battle plan it
109:36 survives about one shot and then Islay
109:38 oh my god it's all different holy cow
109:41 yeah I just throw a throw crazy one just
109:44 occurred to me they show up and
109:47 everything's cool but they have like a
109:50 dog creature that is sort of their weird
109:52 pet
109:53 and they seem to just travel with this
109:55 pet and it's weird-looking and its
109:58 ferocious looking and it seems to be
110:00 pretty nice but they feed it in front of
110:03 you and it just just destroys whatever
110:06 the food is and so you see the potential
110:08 in this pitbull thing that they bring
110:11 with them just imagine how that would
110:13 screw everything up you know maybe just
110:14 like oh my god I type they're pretty
110:16 cool but that pet thing what the hell's
110:18 it there for is it there to eat me at
110:19 some point but if it mistaken me for its
110:22 food but if my kid looks like its food
110:24 you know it's just there's just so many
110:27 variables it's nuts let me know what you
110:29 think I'd be interested in everyone's
110:33 thoughts on whether they not whether or
110:36 not you think they're really gonna try
110:38 an alien invasion in the next 10 years
110:43 do you think that I mean let's remember
110:46 just like Bible people believe the end
110:49 of world's always going to be coming and
110:51 it never does unfortunately you know
110:56 since this von Braun theory hatched in
110:59 late 70s which I don't know when the
111:02 secretary first said this I know I've
111:05 seen videos of her in the 90s saying
111:07 this but you would think she would have
111:09 dropped that idea pretty soon after von
111:12 Braun died which I think was 78 or so am
111:14 i dead but do you think is gonna happen
111:17 and you know what does that entail what
111:21 do you think are the factors that are
111:24 you know some of the things I didn't
111:26 mention the first thing on the tip of
111:28 your tongue that's like you didn't even
111:29 say anything about this and some other
111:31 wing of complete chaos that we'd have to
111:35 deal with fill up the comments let's see
111:38 what we can come up with anyway if you
111:42 haven't been at deep thoughts radio.com
111:43 please go we have two video feeds
111:46 YouTube and [ __ ] shoot please create a
111:48 [ __ ] shoot account it's a freedom of
111:50 speech zone again the more users they
111:52 have the more money they can raise to
111:54 keep it going be really shitty if it
111:57 just disappeared if you want some audio
112:00 there's two audio feeds for you social
112:04 media we have a lock facebook group full
112:06 of some great people it's getting a
112:08 little bit of uptick I tweet a little
112:10 bit more than I used to
112:10 I don't like twitter that much because
112:13 it's just all dark if you want to see
112:16 the darkest human condition on this
112:21 planet Twitter has got to be right next
112:23 to some ghetto somewhere I mean it's
112:27 just horrible
112:27 we've got Minds calm which is a
112:30 competitor to Facebook but it's first
112:31 I'm in protected please make an account
112:33 over there for the same exact reasons we
112:35 want one obit shoot gab calm seems to be
112:39 quite quite a ways behind everyone else
112:43 like they don't have any sensitivity for
112:46 URLs and so I post video in there and
112:50 there's no thumbnail for it so maybe
112:52 they get there I don't know why they
112:54 don't have it since WordPress as it
112:55 seems like it's just some module out
112:57 there you could just cut paste into your
112:58 code but - comm is beautiful.i i truly
113:03 hope there's some celebrity who moves
113:06 over there and says I'm not doing
113:08 Facebook anymore if you want to see me
113:10 you got to go to mines because that
113:12 would be awesome but since celebrities
113:14 are all you know compromised on average
113:17 that's why they don't move there's a
113:20 couple of ways to donate to the site
113:21 paypal and patreon patreon get you in
113:23 the credits forever gets you early
113:26 access to videos like this and there's a
113:29 20% discount on the store but i know
113:30 times are rough so don't even sweat it
113:32 there are two designs for shirts in the
113:36 store I have
113:37 one of each and I would say the quality
113:39 is utterly fantastic the pullover I got
113:43 for the second design thing is so soft I
113:48 can't even tell you it's like I don't
113:50 want to wash the thing cause that I want
113:51 to change its composite but it's really
113:53 nice and thick shirts are super thick -
113:56 because I their Hanes so it's awesome
113:58 if you're looking for the first hundred
114:00 episodes they're not on this season or
114:02 run on this channel they're off in their
114:04 own channel I put them off on a
114:06 different Channel so don't interrupt the
114:08 flow of the counts because I had to
114:10 remaster about 104 episodes which was no
114:13 fun
114:14 [ __ ] shoot has a mall which is
114:16 beautiful so if YouTube ever disappeared
114:18 for any reason or we got banned or
114:20 whatever then it'll all go bid shoot of
114:23 course they own all the Masters hehehe
114:25 so we can put it up on a different
114:26 platform YouTube's acting really strange
114:30 man i posted like they've redone their
114:33 studio software so when i post there's a
114:37 really nice wizard that takes your video
114:38 up but for the corona one about corona
114:42 response the coronavirus response i
114:45 actually told them not to monetize it
114:47 because i knew they were going to turn
114:48 off anyway and they automatically turned
114:51 it on and then limited it so sort of
114:54 strange there anyway take care of
114:58 yourself in someone else and i'll see
115:00 you in the next deep thoughts over now
