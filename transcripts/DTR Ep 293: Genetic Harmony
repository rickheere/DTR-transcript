00:34 gentlemen today we're gonna cover an
00:39 interesting subject I'm gonna call it
00:43 genetic harmony it doesn't have anything
00:47 to do with necessarily race harmony has
00:50 to do with genetics and here is the
00:55 dilemma we're going to talk about in
00:56 this particular episode which is that we
00:59 know that various parts of the world are
01:02 way ahead of other parts of the world
01:03 right we know that for a fact
01:06 we know that organizations have taken
01:09 advantage of these differences right you
01:12 have a tribe in Africa that lives on top
01:15 of a mountain or by a mountain or on top
01:16 of land that has a resource that some
01:19 other country wants access to because
01:21 they've invented a product that needs
01:22 the resource below them in reality that
01:27 product will only probably be
01:28 competitive for fifty to a hundred years
01:30 and so in the 50 200 years that products
01:32 going to be really popular among men
01:35 they're gonna rape the land underneath
01:38 this tribe they don't want to get any
01:41 blood on their hands and so they go to
01:42 the tribe next door that's perhaps
01:45 slightly more sophisticated and they
01:47 offer them money and wealth and status
01:49 within their own ground which costs the
01:51 pennies on the dollar this third party
01:53 and they say you know you can have all
01:55 this if you just go and kill that tribe
01:57 over there because we want the stuff
01:59 underneath their land we have all these
02:02 technologies that make the world seem
02:03 smaller right we have the internet we
02:06 have cameras everywhere both
02:10 professional and probably 98% person
02:13 cameras on telephones so the whole world
02:16 is being recorded and captured by all
02:17 these surveillance companies right in
02:20 agencies what made the world seem big
02:23 the world seemed big because we didn't
02:25 know what was over the elephant bone
02:27 graveyard over the hill across that
02:29 ocean that made it seem big but in
02:31 reality the world's always been the same
02:33 size we keep getting told that you know
02:37 the world was just discovered by white
02:39 man as soon as the white man got there
02:40 but every time we ever get anywhere
02:42 there's always something else that was
02:43 there before and with all these cultures
02:47 that were well embedded into desert
02:49 communities and Alps and all we just
02:52 kind of minimized their existence right
02:54 now the world has been inhabited for way
02:59 longer than we are taught they use this
03:03 fake ice age thing to make you think it
03:06 all got erased you know in season one I
03:10 gave an analogy that's very very
03:12 important to remember I give it all the
03:14 time to friends of mine I really just
03:16 see a huge epiphany on their face and
03:18 the analogy was the royal family the
03:22 Windsor family of Britain who do take
03:25 these Safari journeys down to Africa and
03:28 they you know they have a whole
03:31 celebration that's given in their name
03:33 and they smile and they have a good time
03:35 and then after it's all over my story
03:39 starts and my story starts that Charles
03:43 you know forgive me for victimizing this
03:46 poor man but I pulled you aside up on a
03:48 little Ridge and there's the dance going
03:50 on it's already happened everyone's
03:52 finishing up their food and drink and
03:54 whatever is going on
03:55 he's point-c the crowd and he says of
03:58 the tribe and he looks at you and he
04:00 goes now do you see why we have to get
04:02 rid of them all and you're like what are
04:05 you talking about why are you even here
04:07 if you're thinking about hurting these
04:08 people are getting rid of them he says
04:11 they're 3,000 years behind the rest of
04:13 us what are we supposed to do what are
04:17 we supposed to do with the whole
04:18 civilization that is essentially
04:22 impossibly behind the rest of us there's
04:25 no technology there's no method of
04:26 teaching
04:27 that really has been invented to get
04:29 these folks to our level right now you
04:33 might think we don't have to do anything
04:35 we can leave them alone and that's kind
04:38 of where I'm gonna go in a few of the
04:39 suggestions here but the problem that's
04:42 going on that you can see is that
04:44 genocide is being orchestrated by those
04:48 who want the land those who want the
04:50 stuff in the land perhaps they want the
04:53 sky I don't know but they want there to
04:57 be absolutely no threat they want total
04:59 and utter control and when you want to
05:03 do that to another society you realize
05:05 you run into a lot of problems a lot of
05:07 logistics do we ever talk about this do
05:11 we ever talk about how we're gonna
05:12 handle regions of the world that are a
05:16 thousand two thousand three thousand or
05:18 perhaps even ten thousand years behind
05:21 the rest of the world and again it's
05:24 usually only in technology you're gonna
05:28 find extremely wise people in these
05:31 tribes they're gonna know all these life
05:33 hacks how to survive right they're gonna
05:36 be in perpetual balance with nature on a
05:38 physical level you know there's a
05:40 survival show I saw once where this is
05:43 white guy who went to Australia to cross
05:45 one of their deserts and he he brings
05:48 everything he's got all these survival
05:50 background underneat I don't know if he
05:51 had military background but he
05:52 definitely had a huge background of
05:54 surviving hostile environments and he
05:55 goes up against this old man looked like
05:58 Morgan Freeman this Aborigine guy he
06:00 just had like a gallon of water with him
06:02 he wore of like a suit I just walked her
06:06 he just walked across the desert no
06:07 problem and the white guy gave up I
06:10 think he was like a third into the
06:12 desert and he was just getting yep I
06:13 bought flies and all kinds of stuff now
06:15 he's trying to create a show that's
06:16 gonna wow you and all that but I dare
06:20 say that was the eventualities it was
06:23 going to occur no matter what so what
06:27 did the Arab region need do to get
06:29 across the desert well he knew the
06:30 technology necessary to engage his
06:32 indigenous world
06:35 the other dude didn't yeah
06:38 perhaps the white boy would do better
06:40 crossing some Swiss Alps hell if I know
06:45 now we have laws in the world that say
06:47 you can't kill people right you know
06:50 they don't really get applied very well
06:52 in the world right we have countries all
06:55 over the place that are all upside down
06:57 and you have countries that have pretty
07:01 much fully functional societies they
07:04 differ greatly from the West's
07:07 methodologies and morals and but we
07:10 still rationalize with our citizens
07:12 through some propaganda machine why we
07:14 should go kill the folks that happen to
07:16 have what a resource underneath their
07:19 land that is really really avidly sold
07:22 in the world like oil for the ones that
07:26 are in South America well they usually
07:27 have trees you know in Africa they have
07:30 uranium and diamonds and gold and you
07:32 know Africa is the most untapped
07:34 continent on this planet as far as I'm
07:36 aware okay a challenge is is that if
07:40 we're going to be big grown-up
07:42 globalists right and you know obviously
07:44 no one on this show wants to be a
07:45 globalist but if you're not gonna take
07:48 it if we aren't going to take the advice
07:49 or objectives which are littered with
07:52 nefarious undertones and death and
07:56 genocide right if we don't want to see
07:58 the world get just erased then we're
08:01 gonna have to have a methodology to deal
08:04 with it but there's some people that are
08:07 gonna argue profusely about the idea
08:10 that you know you can't enable certain
08:13 sectors of the world to have certain
08:15 technologies because they'll go nuts
08:17 with it and they'll stop hurting each
08:21 other and eventually they'll hurt those
08:23 who gave them the weapons and you know
08:25 and I think in a lot of a cases that
08:27 makes sense right if someone brings you
08:29 a bunch of weapons to hurt your own
08:30 people well obviously that's that's the
08:32 person that needs to go not you not your
08:34 neighbor down the street but this is
08:38 played out all over the world isn't it
08:40 right and I hate to mention any specific
08:43 cases because it sounds like I have a
08:45 bias I don't
08:47 there's just very profound cases in the
08:51 world where we can point a finger and go
08:53 you see what happened there that has to
08:55 stop you know Africa it is it has been a
09:02 victim of this circumstance for a very
09:04 very long time they go to again a
09:07 civilization that has figured out you
09:10 know radio and you know you know how to
09:12 buy products and live a normal
09:14 relatively normal life as compared to
09:16 the first world countries and then these
09:18 corporations move in and say if you give
09:22 you a ton of money we go kill those
09:24 tribesmen over that are still painting
09:26 themselves every morning particular clay
09:28 color when they choose their spouse
09:30 they're looking at who jumps higher
09:32 because we you know come on look at them
09:35 33 million years behind you
09:36 you're so much more sophisticated we as
09:39 whoever these corporations are I've
09:41 chosen you you're the chosen ones you're
09:44 the smarter ones get over there and get
09:45 rid of them and then we will spoil you
09:47 with riches and that's what they do they
09:50 actually follow up with the riches - but
09:52 again it's only riches compared to their
09:53 local region which is pennies on the
09:55 dollar for what's being taken out of the
09:57 ground over there once that other tribes
09:59 killed right imagine taking out of the
10:02 ground you know a hundred tons of
10:04 uranium that's worth I don't know fifty
10:08 billion dollars but the price tag to buy
10:11 that is five million dollars to a
10:15 warlord maybe 50 million dollars right
10:17 you're paying less than a single percent
10:19 investment to get a fifty billion dollar
10:22 stash out of the ground over there and
10:24 because there's no regulations and
10:26 nothing it protects the world they can
10:29 leave it just a burned-out husk of
10:31 itself right there was a lot of forgot
10:34 that gentleman's name but there's the
10:36 guy that did the the bell curve test for
10:39 genetics he did it on a racial level and
10:44 what he was able to sort of baked in his
10:47 data was said certain races are smarter
10:50 than other races and his assertion was
10:54 is that the genetic pool is less than
10:57 another genetic pool
10:59 now that was very Impala
11:02 it obviously hurt people's feelings but
11:05 there's truth to it unfortunately and
11:07 the truth is really has to do with your
11:11 necessities in life right if you don't
11:14 need to mature and need to develop
11:16 technologies but well beyond where you
11:19 are then you're in balance with nature
11:21 right so as a lot of these tribes that
11:24 still hunt animals every morning and
11:26 live very primitive lives they're in
11:29 total balance with nature as compared to
11:31 us who feel like we need to you know
11:34 pull lithium out of mountains in North
11:36 Korea so we can put them in our
11:38 batteries and build devices that we have
11:42 to have that then we throw away every
11:43 year and a half because they are too
11:44 slow right necessity is one part of
11:49 development of intelligence right you
11:51 need to develop beyond where you are
11:53 well that's the only reason why we ever
11:55 invent anything right exploration is
11:58 another thing right as I was seeing this
12:00 show patterns are what caused humanity
12:05 to explore when we get tired of a
12:07 pattern we go for bigger patterns and
12:10 different patterns you know imagine
12:13 you're landlocked your whole life and
12:14 then you jump in a boat and you start
12:15 sailing the sea and you find another
12:17 piece of land once you have that
12:19 experience you're pretty damn addicted
12:20 to holy [ __ ] there's a whole nother
12:23 planet out there I need to get explored
12:25 right
12:26 now the first organic side of genetic
12:31 intelligence has to do with necessity
12:32 okay put that aside on the left on the
12:34 right side you have oppression you want
12:40 to be smarter here perhaps you were
12:42 smarter at one point you had emerald
12:44 cities and all kinds of wild stuff but
12:46 someone came in who was violent and
12:49 knocked it all down and then put you in
12:52 shackles and held you down and you
12:54 couldn't get any further in life as each
12:57 generation is born they don't get the
13:00 knowledge that you had to give them so
13:02 their brains which were born fairly
13:04 intact and fairly detailed inside the
13:07 number of neurons genetic neurons from
13:09 your your protein patterns that go
13:12 to your child starts to diminish because
13:14 they're not thinking anymore it's
13:16 happening in America everyday right does
13:20 the right side of the equation I know
13:22 that there have been sort of really
13:25 primitive experiments that tested taking
13:28 people from the wild and pulling them
13:30 into modern society you know there's
13:32 been a few rich people that took people
13:34 straight out of jungles and straight out
13:36 of deserts and put them into penthouse
13:38 suites and they they came back a month
13:41 later and the place was a jungle inside
13:43 because no one had taken them aside said
13:46 this is what this is or even if they did
13:48 the words coming out of their mouth made
13:50 absolutely no sense the necessity that
13:53 first world country people have
13:55 developed for themselves don't make any
13:57 sense there's someone from a more
14:00 homogenous world so the idea that one
14:04 person is winning because they have more
14:06 synaptic upon I can solve you know
14:09 algebra equations versus a group of
14:12 folks that live in perfect harmony and
14:15 wherever they're from is a fallacy it's
14:20 a Mis classification of superior
14:24 genetics it is simply different genetics
14:28 when you see images and videos and
14:32 documentaries on these tribes you see a
14:35 very peaceful culture in most cases if
14:38 they're not being cornered by a
14:39 corporation trying to chop down their
14:41 rainforests or you know again incubate a
14:45 war against them as long as that's not
14:47 occurring they live pretty basic lives
14:52 we know from modern society they're
14:55 winning and we're losing our notion is
14:59 that we are pushing forward through all
15:01 this pain to get us to a new pinnacle of
15:05 mankind
15:07 the thing perhaps can be more balanced
15:09 and then at that point in some george
15:12 jetson world perhaps you could bring it
15:14 first and straight from the desert and
15:17 they go straight into this new world
15:18 they're like well this is different for
15:19 sure i got to learn how to do a few
15:21 things but i don't have to learn how to
15:23 drive i don't learn how to how to make
15:25 your food
15:26 because your machines make it for me I
15:29 was worried about where I'm sleeping at
15:31 night because it's all set up it's
15:32 automated right we're not there yet if
15:36 they're you know truly is some space
15:39 threat towards this planet and we don't
15:42 have protectors and we're truly this
15:44 insignificant bacteria on this ball but
15:49 we developed technology to build you
15:51 know Agra domes and space stations and
15:53 sort of those floating worlds out in
15:56 space and we can get somewhere else and
15:57 we don't die to radiation and things
15:59 then this battle will have been worth it
16:02 right so let's pretend in this episode
16:06 that we have been tasked with dealing
16:08 with this problem because I think it is
16:11 a it's it's not really like an impending
16:15 problem except for the fact that we know
16:17 that people exploit these groups of
16:21 people around the world right and if we
16:23 care about our fellow man we're talking
16:25 about usually a very small population of
16:28 people they're being exploited by this
16:31 in some cases the population of these
16:34 individuals is well controlled the
16:37 tribes that I have seen that they have
16:39 discovered in South America have very
16:42 low populations some of the folks that
16:45 they have discovered in Africa have
16:47 gigantic populations it's sort of their
16:51 pastime to procreate because there's
16:53 nothing else to do and then there in
16:55 Africa most of the tribes are well aware
16:57 of the first world you know they were
16:59 t-shirts and stuff this ain't Nike on
17:01 them they've got a radio they got a TV
17:03 but very little else whereas in South
17:07 America and you might see a pot or a pan
17:09 or a knife looks like it's from the
17:12 first world but there's plenty down
17:13 there that haven't been that discovered
17:14 they haven't been interacted with they
17:18 also these groups that are again
17:23 probably at a minimum you know 1,500 to
17:29 2,000 years behind the rest I mean think
17:31 about this let's do a little bit of math
17:32 here you find a tribe out there I don't
17:36 care where you find them
17:37 they have mud huts they have further
17:40 food every morning all of their food
17:42 creation is by hand and using pottery at
17:45 best but usually a rock or a stick or
17:48 something that's been carved down and
17:50 you think about where the Romans were in
17:53 the years 0 ad or whatever the hell you
17:56 want to call it
17:57 they had aqueducts they had legions they
18:00 had made iron you know they had trifa
18:05 Shaye's and all kinds of stuff right I
18:07 mean they not quite trebuchet but they
18:09 had a lot of siege weapons they had
18:11 chariots they had figured out how to
18:13 dress a horse in armor right they knew
18:17 how to build pyramids and Coliseum's and
18:21 temples of incredible detail look at the
18:25 Egyptians which Eve Graham Hancock is
18:28 correct you're talking about a
18:31 civilization that existed around 39,000
18:34 BC and before building pyramids based on
18:38 PI but even if you take the normal years
18:44 that they give you in history it's 3200
18:46 BC is when the first great pyramid was
18:48 supposedly built me again I think this
18:50 has been debunked photographically by
18:53 filming the the number of pharaohs that
18:56 existed inside this one temple that has
18:58 of the years and the months over there
19:00 over there dynasties
19:02 so either someone in these tribes is
19:06 still building mud huts okay at a
19:09 minimum is 5,200 years behind the rest
19:13 of us or they might be I don't know
19:19 45,000 years behind the rest of us you
19:22 know like what if we said you know call
19:24 us when you build a pyramid call us when
19:27 you've learned how to build a structure
19:29 out of stone pillars that have read tops
19:34 and you know you're you have a burial
19:37 ritual that is very developed but
19:40 doesn't know when you have a super
19:41 sophisticated scientific example of what
19:45 you think the stars are let us know when
19:47 you figure out where you think the Sun
19:50 is and
19:50 to earth hell for a flat earthers your
19:55 thing is this let us know when you
19:57 figure out that the Sun and the moon
19:58 only 3200 miles up in the air and then
20:01 we're in a firmament dome yeah you know
20:03 it goes on and on on so just at face
20:06 value we can easily prove that these
20:10 tribes are thousands of years behind us
20:13 all right you get it
20:15 so let's throw some very basic solutions
20:20 out there and let's pick them apart well
20:25 for those of you have seen HBO's
20:26 Westworld you know what it's like for
20:29 them to quarantine a piece of land
20:30 that's very large to to terraform it to
20:34 look like Arizona or Japan or as you I
20:40 think you're gonna see the medieval sort
20:43 of King Arthur days if they stick with
20:46 the the movie script I think India's
20:50 definitely been established or some sort
20:53 of maybe it's even African safari I'm
20:55 not quite sure what happened in that
20:56 season 5 was the depe sewed 5 intro none
21:00 of this will ruin it for you at all by
21:01 the way so let's say we do that let's
21:03 say we build big quarantine spots where
21:06 these people go we do one in South
21:09 America in the jungle and the rainforest
21:13 where they're used to it they don't even
21:15 know what's happening we determine a
21:17 diameter of a sphere or I should say a
21:21 sphere but a border around their world
21:25 and we just simply say hey everyone
21:28 we're all signing a world treaty that
21:30 says you can't fly over these zones
21:32 you can't Kim trail them you can't fly
21:35 rockets over them satellites have to
21:37 avoid being detected you can't visit
21:43 yeah will survey surveil use me the
21:48 region to see how they're developing but
21:50 overall we leave them alone in terms of
21:52 the real estate of the world it's a dot
21:54 it's nothing right Africa same thing you
21:59 quarantine a giant part of the desert
22:01 and you make it look natural
22:04 heavens you guys seen the the
22:06 landscaping work that happens when they
22:08 dig out a mountainside and then they
22:09 they want to run a highway by it and
22:11 they they build faux rock instead of big
22:14 cement walls because it looks more
22:17 natural we could do it as Disneyland
22:21 that just built Radiator Springs from
22:24 the animated series cars well if you
22:28 stare down the street
22:29 year looking at Radiator Springs a huge
22:31 fake mountain side that covers up LA
22:34 more accurately and I'm but that would
22:38 be a huge expense wouldn't it
22:39 he was expensive what we get out of it
22:42 hmm well maybe it's not about us right
22:46 what if you had a tiny tribe that was
22:50 you know it's spread out all over the
22:52 places put that way it's spread out all
22:54 over the place and now you got to move a
22:57 tiny tribe inside this region without
22:59 them really knowing what's going on you
23:01 don't want to pollute them with seeing
23:05 you know modern vehicles what have you
23:09 so we'd have to pull some sort of stunt
23:12 right you'd have to put them all to
23:14 sleep gently carefully you'd have to
23:17 have the right dosage for a child and an
23:19 adult then you pick up all their stuff
23:21 and you move it to new locations so
23:24 their huts exactly the same you know but
23:27 they're gonna wake up and find out the
23:28 landscape changed a little bit you put
23:31 them far enough away from the other
23:32 tribes it's gonna take a certain number
23:33 of years for them to even know that
23:35 another tribe exists maybe just like in
23:39 2001 you drop a monolith that can teach
23:41 them something I don't mean literally
23:44 but I mean something that would add
23:45 their mind a little bit closer to where
23:48 they might be right help them out almost
23:51 every tribe as a religion a system of
23:55 belief of where things come from how
23:59 would you learn about their system of
24:00 belief without letting them know you
24:03 exist right the old sociological
24:06 experiment problem of observing a group
24:08 of people without letting them know
24:09 you're observing them thus changing who
24:11 they are
24:12 now most most of these tribes have been
24:15 touched
24:16 by humanity in someone knows the
24:19 photographer knows and anthropologist
24:22 knows someone knows something maybe
24:26 that's enough information maybe it's not
24:29 maybe our decision is to say that is not
24:32 going to work that is not economically
24:34 feasible so our only other option is to
24:39 integrate them you know without
24:42 committing a crime is to integrate them
24:45 into our society it's funny just talking
24:49 about this and thinking about all the
24:50 agendas that we've seen hatched around
24:53 the world for population control you
24:56 know you can imagine someone there
24:57 piping up at one of these you know
24:59 Rothschild meetings going oh this is
25:01 easy will sterilize them all and so they
25:04 live a perfectly complete life but they
25:06 can't procreate voila
25:09 within one generation they're completely
25:11 exterminated I think that's what's going
25:14 on right now again I think that last
25:19 time I heard a read I should say an
25:21 article about the South American tribes
25:23 that are stuck in these sort of
25:25 rainforest areas the rainforests have
25:29 been sold off by the respective
25:30 countries to China or Russia or I don't
25:34 know if I don't think America it really
25:36 has a lot of access to that stuff
25:37 anymore
25:37 I think we went first but these tribes
25:41 are right now as of 2018 sort of an
25:44 impending doom problem we're just like
25:48 the old movies where you got a fleet of
25:50 bulldozers coming at them that's sort of
25:53 what's about to happen as it all gets
25:55 clearer cut down the dilemma comes back
25:59 to this problem that we have in the
26:01 world which is to say are we going to
26:04 eventually force every single person to
26:06 be exactly the same with the exact same
26:09 rules right
26:10 we know there's parts of the world where
26:12 80 year old men takes seven year old
26:14 brides we know there's a part of the
26:16 world where women get castrated so they
26:20 have absolutely no capability of being
26:21 really pleasured in the ultimate way
26:24 because that's just too messy if women
26:27 start living for that then they'll start
26:29 cheating in
26:30 the world and women are just there to
26:31 have kids there's certain areas of the
26:33 world right now
26:34 which sit on top of trillions of dollars
26:36 worth of yearly income that believe this
26:40 all of the countries that seem to have
26:44 figured out equality are depopulating by
26:47 themselves they've allowed sterilization
26:51 food supplies like GMO food supplies to
26:53 get integrated into their society
26:55 unannounced that's messing up the gut
26:58 right a small footnote to that just so
27:02 you guys can track this in your own
27:04 brain no one ever told America the GMO
27:06 was being integrated into our food and
27:09 the interesting thing about that is that
27:12 we all of a sudden had a lot of people -
27:13 gut problems some of you will remember
27:16 when alene was and as a saturated fat
27:20 substitute I think and everyone wouldn't
27:23 bought chips and they said you're gonna
27:24 get runny bowels if you eat oh lean and
27:27 I wouldn't got a thing of like frito
27:30 wasn't no Lay's chips you know
27:31 frito-lay's chips znuff really but Lay's
27:33 chips eat it immediately got what they
27:36 said so our gut like a crampy gut and
27:39 yeah it wasn't good right but as soon as
27:44 GMOs hit everyone had gut problems and
27:47 then they had the demonization of gluten
27:50 it's gluten-free
27:51 why gluten because gluten is a
27:54 repository for glyphosate what happens
27:59 when the stuff gets in your gun will
28:00 destroys your gut it distorts it
28:01 destroys the tentacles in your
28:04 intestinal lining they absorb all of
28:07 your nutrients in your body and so then
28:10 what else exploded around the same time
28:12 that GMOs started to get an overdrive
28:15 starting to get into absolutely
28:16 everything probiotics I live in a
28:20 community that has three or four giant
28:22 ganti probiotic community sorry
28:25 corporations that serve the community
28:26 because probiotics can't live a long
28:29 time they have to get them made locally
28:32 and shipped directly to you when people
28:36 have to eat probiotics so they don't
28:37 have gut problems because they do not
28:40 know the GMO is their normal problem
28:43 right now it's been proposed several
28:46 times the society got super advanced and
28:48 then super [ __ ] and the super
28:50 advanced and super [ __ ] happens over
28:52 and over and over again look at the
28:54 Egyptians the Egyptians are building
28:57 obelisks you know the size of like small
29:00 skyscrapers even though a lot of them to
29:02 get erected at the last phase but they
29:04 built the pyramids the pyramids are
29:07 based on PI the pyramids are actually
29:09 four corners being built into a pyramid
29:13 they're also aligned with celestial
29:15 bodies not only their placement on the
29:17 Giza Plateau
29:18 but a lot of the windows in these
29:21 structures including the Sphinx which
29:24 according to Graham Hancock in its
29:25 original form the body of the Sphinx was
29:27 a chamber that you went into and it was
29:29 a star chamber you looked up through
29:31 windows and certain times of year with
29:33 the winter solstice summer solstice and
29:36 all the equinoxes the stars that were
29:38 important would line up in the windows
29:41 we think it was actually the
29:44 constellation Leo initially and that
29:46 eventually turned into a pharaoh it's a
29:48 theory makes sense
29:49 35,000 BC would have been the last time
29:52 Leo was actually present in the sky
29:54 directly above the Sphinx giving us a
29:58 notion a clue of how far back they had
30:02 actually achieved this amazing
30:03 accomplishment if the pyramids are truly
30:07 a battery like we believe they are with
30:09 conductive stones conductive limestone
30:11 on the inside non-conductive on the
30:13 outside red granite on the hallways and
30:16 the corridors remember there are no you
30:20 know torch marks in this place their
30:21 fires weren't burnt to create light but
30:25 even during the brightest day in Egypt
30:26 as soon as you walk inside Willys
30:29 pyramids you weren't able to see
30:30 anything in front of your face so it did
30:32 not appear that anyone was dragging fire
30:34 with them we know that the only fire
30:36 that we could have dragged in there
30:38 would have been very toxic for humans to
30:40 breathe it would have burned up all the
30:42 oxygen very quickly so we do believe
30:43 that perhaps electrical methods were
30:47 used inside the pyramid and if this
30:50 thing was on and again all the
30:52 veneerings stone that's non-conductive
30:54 has been removed except the capstone air
30:56 of the Great Pyramid we could have just
31:00 brought in a device that it took
31:02 electricity and it just lit up you just
31:04 bring a light bulb with you and you hold
31:06 it in your hand and thing turns on you
31:07 walk around the inside of this place
31:09 right so you might have a purist get to
31:11 this debate and simply say well this has
31:16 happened a bunch of times
31:17 this simply needs to continue happening
31:19 a bunch of times maybe millions of years
31:21 okay but again for anyone who believes
31:25 that meteorites and the earth all the
31:27 time and bla bla bla bla bla weekend it
31:32 must be pretty rare okay it must be
31:34 really really rare and again look at my
31:37 video on do craters exist to maybe
31:41 remove a lot of fear-mongering that
31:44 you've had injected into your mind by
31:45 space agencies that want you to pay them
31:47 60 million dollars a day so that they
31:49 will chase maybe none exists in threats
31:51 out of the sky right but back to our
31:54 debate what do we do do we figure out
31:59 how to take them through the old
32:00 experiments that we went through to get
32:02 to where we are except we put them back
32:04 to back we simply say well where are
32:07 they
32:07 you know in the in the history of those
32:10 of us who we believe are really
32:11 sophisticated how did we get to where we
32:15 are and can we take them through that
32:17 avoiding a lot of the acidic stuff like
32:20 war like greed perhaps who knows though
32:25 right the Masons did really really well
32:27 because the Masons could build societies
32:29 that's why they were special they were
32:31 able to build structures they were able
32:33 to build not only survivable structures
32:36 but temples where you could go and
32:37 worship your God of choice the number
32:42 one thing a Mason did to gain super
32:43 popularity was to build a water well
32:46 because once you have a steady supply of
32:49 water you have the ability to build a
32:52 society around that water well huge
32:55 absolutely huge and primitive isn't an
32:58 interesting what do they do in Star Trek
33:00 when they want to go visit a primitive
33:02 Society they do flasks plastic surgery
33:06 on their face that there's any
33:07 biological difference they put clothes
33:10 on
33:10 match the region they typically try to
33:12 use their universal translator to speak
33:14 the language so they can't be figured
33:17 out and they go make contact right maybe
33:22 we're possible we do the same thing you
33:25 know with any region of the world
33:27 there's always the genetics that are
33:29 very similar and of course if you're
33:31 made of the same racial genetics you can
33:34 usually see the distinctions between
33:35 some 100 miles away in your own genetics
33:39 I would assume that a lot of these
33:42 tribes have inbreeding qualities that
33:46 keep the very pure in terms of their
33:48 appearance right the idea would be to
33:51 get inside of their world of this
33:55 particular strategy I should say and
33:57 again drop hints drop little notions
34:01 little tidbits that are been play tested
34:04 in you know groups philosophers and
34:09 historians and other people that are
34:11 very close to these tribes who have made
34:13 it to the next level and people who know
34:16 their religion you know what if someone
34:18 worshipped a cow and someone mentioned
34:22 for a second that you could eat a cow
34:24 well that would be a really bad thing
34:26 right you would go from being
34:30 potentially a solution to being you know
34:34 a really bad person in their world now
34:37 what benefits could we have by perhaps
34:40 seating them with more technology just
34:43 interesting stuff you know again Faraday
34:46 1830s this dude had I think his his
34:51 paper said that you know his entire
34:54 laboratory was essentially wood wires
34:56 and magnets wood nails and that kind of
34:59 stuff just basic stuff this guy became
35:02 the godfather of electricity hmm maybe
35:07 we simply provide the basics and see
35:09 what happens but now let me ask you I
35:12 think our goal would be to say one of
35:16 the tribesmen I say that in generic
35:19 gender sense figures this stuff out he's
35:24 doing really well or she's doing really
35:25 well
35:25 and our hope is that they shared
35:29 immediately with their tribe go tell
35:31 your other tribes remember what you
35:33 figured out but maybe the guy or girl
35:34 doesn't want to maybe they're fearful of
35:37 the repercussions of perhaps black magic
35:39 accusations remember we went through a
35:41 witch hunt literally in this country and
35:46 maybe you had people that were trying to
35:48 curse people and they needed to be
35:50 smacked down but some people may have
35:51 just figured out something that looked
35:52 freaky cigars real interesting thing
35:55 about cigars
35:56 I forget the gentleman's name it's a
35:59 long I think it's a Spanish name but one
36:03 of the adventures who came to the United
36:07 States or I should say North America who
36:11 had discovered tobacco being rolled by
36:13 the Native Americans he brought back
36:16 bundles of tobacco to Europe he was
36:23 smoking and I've heard two different
36:24 versions of the story one of them was
36:26 that he came home and rolled up a cigar
36:28 and simply took in a cloud of smoke and
36:32 wretch or held it out of his nostrils
36:34 and when his wife saw it he she freaked
36:38 out ran out the door called the cops on
36:40 him and he was put away for like demon
36:43 possession until he could prove what he
36:45 was doing the other side of the story
36:47 was that he was actually in a pub or
36:49 something and did the same thing and
36:51 everyone freaked out so you can see how
36:52 amazingly primitive things can go awry
36:57 so you know best intentions can go
37:01 completely wonky if we want to intervene
37:06 if we quarantine these people you know
37:11 there could be a moral sort of opinion
37:15 by the population to say you have no
37:18 right to do that and we would say why
37:20 what are you talking about they say well
37:22 what if they did want to go on a big
37:23 journey and they hit the edge of this
37:24 thing that would have been a natural
37:27 progression of their adventure and your
37:31 stopping
37:31 from their normal progression and I
37:35 think there's a lot of counter logic to
37:38 that because they remain hidden in some
37:41 cases like these tribes we still finding
37:42 them around the world they remain hidden
37:44 because they do stay in the same spot
37:46 you know now go to the first world /
37:50 third world countries give you a first
37:52 world problem in America 40 to 50 years
37:56 ago people were not morbidly obese like
37:59 they are today children were barely
38:02 obese okay you would get you would get a
38:05 couple right and it's the parents
38:06 feeding the kid cake too much right it's
38:09 always the parents fault always but we
38:13 started doing fast food and when fast
38:15 food hit this place turned into you know
38:19 third actor Wally
38:20 we got blimps everywhere right now we
38:25 had perfected this fast-food thing and
38:27 sent it over to England my buddy Robert
38:31 the one in England I was asking him
38:33 about you know the fact that what I
38:36 visited over there was like three times
38:38 in one year I noticed that the really
38:42 young people who wouldn't be remotely
38:44 heavy in our world we're gaining weight
38:48 in really strange ways right like they'd
38:51 have big giant pockets of fat in areas
38:54 of the body that we simply don't gain it
38:55 over here and the reason why was sort of
38:59 a two-fold answer he goes look I have
39:02 watched this happened since the 70s and
39:04 he goes as soon as you're McDonald's got
39:06 here we had huge health issues and he
39:09 goes you know both of us kind of deduced
39:11 that it was like the people who were
39:13 getting heavy had never been exposed to
39:15 such food before and so their bodies
39:18 were gaining weight in areas that they
39:20 wouldn't normally gain weight simply
39:22 because they didn't have a history of
39:26 fighting off all this fat it's really
39:29 sad think about first world products
39:32 getting into third world countries you
39:35 have countries that are very balanced
39:37 and all the sudden
39:40 they're wanting cellphones right there's
39:43 women in India who are getting
39:45 hysterectomies for a cell phone that's
39:48 the exchange to reduce world population
39:51 a hysterectomy you get rid of your
39:53 ability to have children now I I'm
39:55 hoping to god that the the back story
39:59 behind that is that these women already
40:00 have all their children and they're
40:02 simply saying yeah I was gonna get it
40:03 anyway so might as well get a cell phone
40:05 for it my fear is that it might be an 18
40:09 to 25 year old female that's never had a
40:11 family yet and before she has the
40:14 intellectual capacity to weigh what she
40:16 is sacrificing her whole body the whole
40:20 mechanism in her body to have a child
40:22 has been removed you could never put
40:24 that back you could tie a tube and then
40:26 untie it but you can't repair a
40:28 hysterectomy right
40:30 as soon as America start attacking the
40:33 Middle East after a Desert Storm way
40:36 back in the early 90s well you're
40:40 talking about a country that forbids you
40:41 from drinking alcohol you can be killed
40:43 as a result of turning up drunk in
40:45 certain areas but they had huge
40:50 outbreaks of cocaine heroin all kinds of
40:56 drugs started moving into their
40:58 countries we had destroyed their world
41:00 so it's depressing to be there and hey
41:03 if you take your head off some drugs
41:04 it'll make you feel a little bit better
41:06 it's not like it's the first time this
41:08 some of those drugs have been grown
41:11 there and enjoyed as a pastime of
41:14 perhaps even a religion at times but I
41:16 think we're well past that in the
41:18 quantities and the methodologies of
41:20 which is it is applied today as almost
41:23 purely destructive to their kind so we
41:26 have seen these these marvels of first
41:29 world pastimes and inventions absolutely
41:32 tamper with the normal development of
41:36 society in every region of the world all
41:40 right have we really figured out the
41:43 social impact of social media - first of
41:48 all countries the damage that's about to
41:50 occur to our future generations if they
41:52 can't get out of this mess
41:53 I don't know I think we have a major
41:56 hints of what's going on for those of
42:00 you who follow Black Mirror on Netflix
42:02 season 3 episode 1 is about a girl who's
42:05 addicted to this application application
42:07 on her telephone that is a global
42:10 application where everyone rates
42:12 everyone else so if you're an [ __ ]
42:14 you get down thumbs if you're a nice
42:17 person you get up thumbs and you have
42:18 this sort of total economy of your
42:21 behavior in society and they built a
42:25 whole episode around that ok well China
42:29 has one of those apps it is currently a
42:31 private sector app that you can
42:33 electively download but they're
42:35 currently saying that the country is
42:36 going to make it mandatory in two years
42:39 in a year and a half 2020 china is going
42:43 to force every single citizen to have
42:45 this app and to rate each other if you
42:49 don't know how devastating that can be
42:51 go watch the first season there sorry
42:55 third season first episode of black
42:57 mirror it's terrifying as to how social
43:01 media could get sort of the trough
43:04 feeders to control society I've been on
43:08 one level it sounds great yeah we want
43:10 [ __ ] out of this planet we want them
43:14 to stick out like a sore thumb you know
43:16 you're being a jerk stop being a jerk
43:18 that sounds great
43:19 take it to another level someone
43:24 believes something completely different
43:25 than you they think that the God that
43:26 you worship is annoying fake the reason
43:31 why the world sucks and every single
43:33 time you go to your church they just
43:36 drive by you and because this phone
43:37 thing as a proximity identifier right
43:39 they don't even know you all your names
43:41 show up what you're walking into your
43:43 church and they're just locked down down
43:44 down down down down and the more secular
43:47 we go the easier this little avalanche
43:50 can go what if you like to partake in
43:55 this is we're good to do a global
43:57 problem you like to partake in content
43:59 on the internet that is deemed and
44:01 completely illegal and other parts of
44:02 the world what do you do about that when
44:05 you try to visit over there
44:06 all right but they just look at you and
44:08 you know that the dogs and they know you
44:10 watch porn and so you just see each
44:12 other you just go at it you know we're
44:15 not ready for that sort of system to be
44:18 put in place in my opinion we're
44:22 probably I don't know a thousand years
44:23 ahead of this question ever really being
44:26 answered or dealt with but I thought
44:29 it'd be interesting to get into this and
44:31 start seeing sort of you know your
44:34 opinions of what are potentially not
44:38 problems that are perceived as problems
44:39 things that are problems that aren't
44:42 perceived as problems you know for those
44:45 of us who grow up without the internet
44:47 and all the technology that is
44:48 integrated into the internet we know
44:51 that the world was a better place in
44:53 many ways without it it was better that
44:57 the phone rang that was busy because you
44:59 were on the phone or it ringing forever
45:01 because you were not home and people
45:04 just sort of learned your routines and
45:08 they didn't call you at certain times of
45:09 day you know I have friends of mine and
45:13 we're all guilty of this but every
45:16 single time their phone rings they feel
45:18 like they have to answer it it's like
45:21 it's our moral imperative to answer
45:22 every single phone call the second that
45:24 someone demands that they answer their
45:26 phone I'm calling you you must answer it
45:28 and then they will be in the
45:30 conversation with you on the phone and
45:32 some super productive conversation and
45:33 they're hopping out because some random
45:36 numbers calling them aside just letting
45:38 it go to voicemail they have been
45:40 trained like Pavlov's dog to worship
45:43 text messages to worship telephone calls
45:45 to worship every notification for every
45:47 social media app that they have they
45:50 feel like they are missing out I think
45:54 that's dying off you know the reports
45:56 are that a lot of social media is dying
45:58 off I will definitely tell you that
46:00 there's a group in the world that
46:01 participates in running the world that
46:02 would love that to happen on one level
46:04 hey man let's get back to the point when
46:06 nobody was informed about anything and
46:08 we totally controlled the world imagine
46:12 just as an example but every single
46:15 social media mogul out there Twitter
46:19 Instagram Facebook Google YouTube
46:23 because it's owned by Google all of them
46:25 go out of business
46:26 and they can run a cover story of a
46:29 scandal they're violating First
46:32 Amendment or whatever they all go out of
46:34 business financial problems they give
46:37 any crime you could possibly accuse this
46:40 companies companies of and their CEOs
46:42 and their employees and it all goes out
46:44 of business in like a year
46:45 then we're without social media you
46:48 think you know well they'll be
46:49 replacements no no because the things
46:51 that brought them down restrict you from
46:52 ever being in that category as well
46:54 right no one in the United States of
46:58 America as far as I know it is allowed
47:02 to make a free dating site anymore
47:04 because of a human trafficking problem
47:08 that we have in the world so a bunch of
47:10 well a few bad apples actually mess it
47:13 up for a bunch of people that are you
47:15 know finding their spouses and being
47:16 married on these services so the only
47:18 ones that can exist today are the ones
47:19 that take credit cards because it's not
47:22 anonymous which is kind of not the truth
47:27 because people I understand it you could
47:29 buy a credit card and just you know some
47:32 prepaid cards that you can take around
47:34 as like a homeless person so you could
47:36 sign up completely fake who you are you
47:39 could use someone else's photograph
47:40 bunch of fake bio stuff and say meet me
47:42 at this place and we'll go out and get
47:44 drinks or have dinner or whatever and
47:46 it's some bad situation turns into a
47:49 human trafficking situation somebody
47:51 dies it's interesting right there been a
47:57 lot of rumors around agenda 21 which is
47:59 now called agenda 2030 and the the
48:04 sources are pretty hearsay ish so please
48:09 take what I'm about to say with a
48:10 massive grain of salt but when you think
48:13 it through if this isn't true and again
48:18 it's been it's been spoken over 20 years
48:21 if not even 40 years from a bunch of
48:24 different sources I don't know if this
48:25 is like a UFO phenomenon everyone's
48:27 carrying this story arc forward but the
48:30 story goes is that those that
48:32 I would say pre queuing on who control
48:35 the world the deep state have wanted to
48:38 take earth back to sort of the Middle
48:41 Ages where we have very little
48:43 population on this planet less than a
48:44 hundred and probably less than 200
48:46 million I would say especially related
48:49 to the Guidestones Georgia Guidestones
48:50 which say under five hundred million
48:52 again as we say on the show no one's
48:55 gonna want maximum capacity on the first
48:57 day so if they set a limit at 500
48:58 million they're gonna probably want to
48:59 start around 100 150 which is 99.9% of
49:03 the population disappearing but they've
49:06 said they want to go backwards they're
49:07 gonna use technology to control any of
49:09 the masses that are allowed to exist
49:11 they're gonna live you know I guess
49:14 supposedly some euphoric world I'm a
49:18 giant plush land and they're gonna be so
49:20 intellectual they're gonna know how to
49:21 to live without really human interaction
49:24 other than their own families I mean how
49:28 many families would there be involved
49:30 you'd have to have a certain minimum
49:32 number of families just to keep from
49:33 inbreeding too much and getting all of
49:35 them you know mentally impaired for
49:40 those of you've missed the movie Logan's
49:42 Run back in the 70s it's a really
49:44 powerful movie to watch because in this
49:47 movie you weren't allowed to make it to
49:50 the age of 30 and so when you're 29
49:52 years old I believe that's the the year
49:54 you had this little crystal that was I
49:56 believe inside your palm or on your
49:59 wrist or something and when you reached
50:04 an age where you were supposed to die
50:06 they called it renewing and you were
50:09 celebrated in your death but no one ever
50:12 made it over 30 if you could imagine
50:15 hell if you're over 30 the more you're
50:19 over 30 that that notion is crazy you
50:21 know it's like Jesus Christ you barely
50:22 figure out who you are at 30 right
50:24 there's something called predictive
50:26 programming which is to say we would
50:29 like to do something that society
50:30 doesn't currently buy into and so we're
50:34 gonna do is we're gonna have a bunch of
50:35 movies go out there television shows and
50:37 we're gonna prime the pump with our
50:40 agenda and just see how it reacts and
50:41 we're gonna put some of the most
50:42 brilliant minds in Hollywood the most
50:44 brilliant writers
50:45 to philosophize this but these potential
50:49 solutions to take them further Star Trek
50:52 has a lot of this DNA in it
50:53 but Logan runt Logan's Run is one of
50:56 these rollerball 1975 is one of these
50:59 even the movie Brazil is one of these by
51:03 Terry Gilliam they play tested and again
51:07 I've said this once in a previous
51:09 episode I know you guys are probably
51:10 tired of me saying that but I'm saying
51:12 this you know I don't have like some
51:13 timers one of the things we do in major
51:17 corporation initiatives let's say you
51:19 have a multi-billion dollar company when
51:21 I worked at Electronic Arts we were a
51:23 multi-billion dollar company okay I
51:25 think I think when I got there in 99
51:27 1999 we were celebrating a 1 billion
51:29 dollar year and then the next year I
51:32 think we hit 3 I mean it was amazing how
51:34 fast we were growing we were number one
51:36 in the world at the time but when we
51:40 wanted to create a a.com into this
51:43 gigantic gaming platform we went off to
51:47 a retreat in December of 1999 in Palo
51:50 Alto California this really cool
51:51 building and this guy led was genius
51:55 like just I don't even know what this
51:57 guy's background was but he led us
51:59 through this simulation of what we were
52:00 about to do which is to say look there's
52:03 a million ways to skin a cat right
52:05 anything business initiative you get
52:06 into is like that okay
52:08 let's simulate this scenario and it
52:13 happens in military all the time they
52:15 have tons of software that simulates
52:16 this stuff right do any of you ever
52:18 watched the the old movie wargames back
52:20 in the early 80s with Matthew Broderick
52:22 you know they had simulations that were
52:25 simulating global thermonuclear war and
52:27 you know essentially what how many
52:30 warheads do anything X you know Russia
52:32 has China has and let's just start the
52:34 war and see who wins and he he kept
52:36 running the simulation but we were in
52:39 this room not planning the end of the
52:40 world but planning one of the coolest
52:42 gaming platforms on planet Earth and it
52:45 went for about a week and the last day
52:48 we divided up every person in the room
52:51 into respective corporations that were
52:53 going to fight for this space and we
52:57 said look your Sony over there
53:00 Macromedia over there which is turned
53:02 into adobe flash because they had flash
53:05 Gamescom where shockwave calm sorry I
53:08 was in the a group and we sat there and
53:12 ran a simulation and everyone was we had
53:15 a group that was the press trying to
53:17 figure out what was going on I was the
53:19 press secretary for the company and it
53:23 was the most eye-opening thing ever to
53:25 find out that what we thought was going
53:27 to be a smooth ride turned into a bunch
53:31 of acquisitions a bunch of controversy
53:34 because a couple of groups had dreamed
53:36 up a way to sort of marginalize us to
53:39 the rest of the world whether or not
53:40 good because of this it's interesting
53:44 this is sort of what I try to do on this
53:46 show and a lot of the subject matter is
53:48 to get us to kind of simulate as the
53:50 owners of the problem what we would do
53:53 with our layman's knowledge right most
53:56 of us are in bubbles we are I'm in the
53:58 bubble of the United States of America
54:00 and furthermore I'm in the bubble of
54:02 California Southern California and so my
54:06 opinions are shaped by the area in which
54:08 I live we have mine right again you can
54:14 take a middle-of-the-road American who's
54:15 a constitutionalist moving to Seattle
54:17 Washington and they will if they live 20
54:19 years they'll be continent usually a
54:21 liberal you could take someone out of
54:24 Seattle Washington and move in Orange
54:26 County California if they stay 20 years
54:29 they will start seeing the light of
54:30 conservatism you know we hivemind
54:36 we see eventually the deep rationales
54:39 that that are surrounding humans believe
54:43 even if we were moved again a second
54:47 time to maybe back to where we came from
54:50 we might look at our last 20 years ago
54:52 what was I thinking
54:53 I was believing all that stuff because
54:57 the deep rationale the deep algorithm of
54:59 our minds hives these cultures that are
55:03 separate from humanity may just be one
55:08 of the biggest gems we have on this
55:10 planet
55:12 now we know that there are tribes out
55:14 there that still practice cannibalism
55:17 you know they kill their their they'll
55:20 have like a little skirmish with the
55:21 tribe next door and they end up eating
55:23 the other people because they have
55:25 religion that believes that they gain
55:27 the was a bunch of weird theories I've
55:31 heard recently last year but they
55:32 believe they gained the power of their
55:34 opponents and they believe that they in
55:36 some cases are actually honoring their
55:39 opponent I'm not sure eating a person
55:42 has this effect but the love is a lot of
55:45 you I'm just going to digress one second
55:46 here there's a lot of you that know that
55:48 when people get organ transplants there
55:52 are certain organs that seem to imbue
55:54 the recipient with some of the skills of
55:57 the source person one of the most famous
56:00 ones was a I think it was a gentleman
56:03 who got the organs from a small child
56:07 you know we're talking that were between
56:09 eight and twelve and they ended up
56:12 becoming an artist and drawing things in
56:14 the hospitals they were recovering not
56:16 only did they gain the ability to draw
56:18 which they had never had before but they
56:22 were drew pictures that were the exact
56:25 same sort of pictures that the kid used
56:29 to draw and they ended up comparing him
56:32 in this document you know you can't
56:34 really trust what you see on TV at the
56:35 time right if not all the time but if
56:38 that's true in any way shape or form
56:40 that's really interesting so the
56:44 question might come back on us should we
56:47 be learning something from them again
56:50 those of us lived in a more primitive
56:52 world know that we at times were much
56:55 happier with less and that's a piece of
56:58 wisdom you hear all the time less is
57:00 more less is more how much money would
57:04 you have if your vices in life didn't
57:06 exist the things you don't need the
57:08 things that you elect to spend your
57:09 money on simply didn't exist what if I
57:11 didn't smoke cigars how many thousands
57:14 of dollars what I saved in a year never
57:16 smoking a cigar now you don't want to be
57:19 the richest guy in the cemetery as they
57:20 say but perhaps there's some sort of
57:24 character development that we
57:25 can get out of these more primitive
57:26 cultures we've overlooked we're so
57:29 arrogant in our self-assurance that we
57:34 have got the drop on civilization well
57:38 maybe we don't when you're a
57:40 technologist it's actually really
57:41 interesting to think first what's second
57:45 that we shouldn't have silicon chips you
57:49 know we shouldn't have miniaturization
57:50 we shouldn't have
57:51 what is that seven nanometer CPUs the
57:55 ability to I don't know travel across
57:59 the entire world in an hour because we
58:01 built some amazing supersonic vehicle
58:04 it's hard to buy that that's a bad thing
58:06 but what's the ynx that's expressed in
58:09 the first part of this episode it is
58:12 that the world is getting smaller and
58:13 smaller and smaller so the more that we
58:16 actually perfect technology to start
58:18 traveling around the world even faster
58:19 and faster and faster
58:21 for those who have you ever had a
58:22 distant a long-distance relationship
58:23 with someone and you've just prayed that
58:26 somebody creates a teleporter right a
58:30 door jamb that you could walk through
58:32 and it just immediately teleports you to
58:34 the other person's location you'll know
58:36 what I'm talking about if that were to
58:39 occur
58:39 geez just think about it you'd have
58:43 thieves stealing things out of your
58:45 house and then just zapping to the other
58:47 side of the world and giving up all of
58:50 your goods then you have the question
58:52 that comes up with your atheist
58:55 evolutionary people and then your
58:57 religious God
58:59 creationism people both of you have I
59:03 think a problem which is that if you're
59:05 an evolutionist the idea is are we
59:08 intellectually surpassing our genetic
59:11 programming meaning we have let's just
59:16 say we have a couple prodigy autists
59:18 humans and they have figured out how to
59:22 do something absolutely extraordinary
59:24 with the human body and the human mind
59:26 and with society and they drop that tech
59:29 on society and they do it in a way that
59:32 everyone can understand it and it starts
59:34 to mold us just like social media but
59:37 a massive blowback where we start
59:42 suffering as a result of it then as an
59:45 evolutionist you might simply say we are
59:47 not really evolved to the level that we
59:49 are at today and then you might either
59:52 adopt going back to a tribal methodology
59:56 through some apocalyptic world
59:58 transformation or you're saying well we
60:02 just need to be grownups we're gonna
60:04 sterilize all those that are behind
60:06 they're gonna simply disappear and then
60:08 what is left is left and then again in
60:11 another couple millennia ten millennia
60:12 we have another discrepancy if we don't
60:16 build a society that distributes all
60:17 knowledge and all wisdom and all
60:19 philosophy equally across all sectors of
60:22 the world to keep us all at the same
60:24 exact understanding what could you
60:28 imagine trying to take the swinger
60:31 community out of Hollywood and mix them
60:33 with the Sharia law folks from the
60:34 Middle East someone's gonna lose
60:38 someone's gonna have to give up their
60:39 ways right if you're creationist then
60:45 God has a much more definitive plan for
60:49 our existence and this is where sort of
60:52 your revelations and a lot of the times
60:54 when God has reset the world comes into
60:57 comes into play right you've got your
60:59 Moses story there she's me let's back up
61:01 your Noah's story where the world is
61:04 flooded and one dude and his family
61:06 capture all the animals that need to be
61:09 captured that aren't that are going to
61:11 die as a result of a flood probably let
61:14 a lot of other natural like fish and
61:16 maybe birds can fly around they don't
61:18 need to be captured but then you have
61:21 your Moses story he comes down with the
61:23 ten commandments you got a bunch of
61:25 drunks over there worshipping a calf and
61:27 God just wipes him out he hasn't in that
61:30 particular scenario wiped out all those
61:32 who dissent against him but on that
61:33 particular day it wasn't the party you
61:36 probably should have showed up - unless
61:37 you're gonna convert to Moses on that
61:39 day you have cities that were turned and
61:42 raised as wife's that look back turned
61:45 to pillars of salt
61:47 those are reset phases right
61:50 some people think we're headed for a big
61:52 reset right now hmm
61:55 do we have harmony right now again as I
61:59 said earlier in this episode there's a
62:01 bunch of tribes in South America that
62:03 are gonna have a real rude awakening
62:05 over the next ten years as China cuts
62:09 down their world because of Brazil and
62:11 Argentina don't give a [ __ ] about nature
62:15 they've sold off their rainforests they
62:18 had a price and they got it right Africa
62:23 hmm well it's sort of in this constant
62:28 death spiral isn't it it's easy to
62:31 convince warlords to kill tribes that's
62:34 pretty easy just buy them off if that
62:36 doesn't occur well you starve them to
62:38 death right for the tribes that are able
62:41 to pull it off and keep them numbers
62:43 limited and on every morning you do
62:46 whatever they do they just they're
62:50 eventualities will be linked to whether
62:52 or not they are in possession of land
62:54 that has any appeal through the same
62:57 countries that buy up rainforests right
63:01 so for any of you who are sort of
63:03 atheists and evolutionary people what
63:06 are your thoughts in the comments like
63:07 literally how do you perceive this is it
63:10 just one of these benign things where
63:12 you just let it go and let nature take
63:14 its course there's a part of me that
63:17 understands that are you more militant
63:19 in your thought process as well we need
63:22 to actively exterminate these
63:23 individuals sterilize them kill them
63:26 genocide them nobody really ever says
63:29 that that's their opinion even if they
63:31 had it I would like to see something far
63:34 more productive occur than something
63:36 like that if you're very religious or
63:40 even mildly religious and you believe
63:41 God does participate at a particular
63:45 percentage of our daily chores again he
63:48 offers this choice so he doesn't control
63:51 us a hundred percent thank God if you're
63:54 an ambassador of God as one of his
63:57 followers what do you think God wants
64:00 you to do part of me thinks well
64:02 genocides not it
64:04 exterminating or sorry
64:08 sterilizing wouldn't be part of the game
64:10 these are his children as well so what
64:14 do you do is it blasphemy to turn them
64:18 into a Westworld
64:19 you know save the robots you just
64:21 basically quarantine them into their own
64:23 space do we go in and try to raise their
64:28 knowledge and raise their awareness of
64:30 the universe imagine how much stuff we
64:33 have debunked on this show and debated
64:36 quite successfully on this show
64:37 especially in the comments sections
64:38 right imagine all these things being
64:41 brought to these tribes you know I'll go
64:45 or be the first one over they're gone
64:46 well there's a lockbox and inside it is
64:48 a global warming and you're burning too
64:52 many tiki torches here and up above a
64:56 sort of brings to mind the whole notion
64:58 that we have people who live in areas
64:59 that get hit by hurricanes we have
65:02 people who live in areas that lose their
65:03 houses every single year to flooding and
65:07 Hawaii we have folks that are losing
65:08 their houses routinely and I mean
65:10 probably by decade to volcanic runoff
65:16 but we don't really have a kalibata
65:18 Dewey insurance companies pay for their
65:20 homes they pay a tremendous amount of
65:22 money for that insurance and we rebuilt
65:24 we rebuild them where they are and then
65:26 they get wiped out again and it just for
65:29 instance and repeats seems illogical but
65:32 those people are willing to pay the
65:33 price because they love the area where
65:34 they live and even if they couldn't get
65:39 the insurance they might find different
65:44 ways to build homes that don't have
65:46 vulnerabilities to mother nature it's
65:50 interesting my personal angst is that
65:55 society is misinformed constantly lied
65:59 to for corporate agendas for a world
66:02 control I do not believe that we should
66:05 set every single you know region of the
66:08 world free to procreate infinitely right
66:10 we don't need to have 20 children
66:13 families anymore you know that that
66:16 whole phenomenon occurred
66:18 where you had any time you get I think
66:20 safely speaking over five kids six and
66:24 above you have an area of the world
66:26 typically where they are part of the
66:29 ecosystem of the family survival there
66:31 are farmers there manufacturers or
66:34 builders and these kids are responsible
66:36 for running off and helping the family
66:39 exist to plow the land to take care of
66:42 the livestock whatever I think we're in
66:45 most areas of the world passed that
66:48 stage if we wanted to you know first of
66:51 all countries for sure third world
66:53 countries well you know you have again
66:56 what is it 90 percent of China is pretty
66:58 agricultural probably a deep 75 to
67:03 perhaps you know eighty-five percent of
67:07 India's the same way South America has
67:10 got a lot of that going on and so if we
67:14 were to modernize their food supply and
67:16 simply say you don't have to do this
67:18 anymore you can have a couple kids and
67:22 maintain rural population at the same
67:24 count right you have one and then you
67:27 have two and that's the replacement for
67:28 you and your wife you have three you you
67:31 increase by one but really you know you
67:34 can you can be okay with two if you want
67:36 to you don't have to turn out all these
67:39 kids some of us love kids right if we
67:43 had the chance we'd have a thousand kids
67:44 but every child deserves a participating
67:48 parent don't they at some point you
67:50 eclipse your ability to check in with
67:53 all of your kids I don't know what the
67:54 threshold is but I'm sure it's less than
67:56 ten let me know what you think in the
67:58 comments this is something that has been
68:01 churning in my brain for a couple years
68:03 since I mentioned it in the first season
68:05 you guys are brilliant people and you're
68:08 compassionate people and you're
68:09 empathetic people and you have all kinds
68:13 of wild backgrounds that would probably
68:14 contribute greatly to the discussion if
68:18 you have them into deep thoughts radio
68:20 calm please go there are audio and video
68:22 links a locked Facebook group a patreon
68:25 page and a store for now we'll see what
68:28 happens there
68:29 we're coming up on the end
68:32 of season three we're probably I I have
68:37 about five in the queue so that means
68:39 we're gonna be over 290 real soon here
68:43 I'll get the rest of them done in the
68:46 next 30 days
68:46 the next the last nine and then I'll
68:51 take a break for probably a month or so
68:53 you know I like to rebrand the show I
68:55 like to choose new music and push out on
69:00 intro I'm trying to make the intro not
69:02 too long but at the same time I'm trying
69:04 to set an atmosphere for you guys for
69:07 those of you know what the show is all
69:08 about if you're like me you know when
69:12 you listen to your favorite show the
69:14 theme music can start being that pavlo
69:16 knee and trigger of like here it comes
69:17 man here comes when I used to watch or
69:20 excuse me
69:21 listen to goes to ghost am dr. Demento
69:26 even x -1 the old sci-fi series so in
69:29 the 1950s when that theme music comes on
69:32 man I get goosebumps it's crazy and even
69:34 if their show sucks the theme music just
69:36 helps set the scene so that's sort of my
69:40 homage to that Pavlo knee and trigger I
69:43 love it myself and I hope you guys dig
69:45 it too yeah a lot of some fun I'm gonna
69:49 hopefully pull in some friends to help
69:51 me shoot a new intro that has a lot more
69:53 character to it than the ones that
69:54 you've seen before so hopefully you dig
69:58 it when it comes but that's another ten
69:59 episodes away take care of yourself in
70:02 someone else and I'll see you in the
70:03 next deep thoughts
