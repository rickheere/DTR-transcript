00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:33 good evening ladies and gentlemen and
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts today
00:40 we're gonna talk about needful things so
00:44 Stephen King wrote a book back in the
00:47 90s I believe called needful things was
00:51 made into a movie and you know typically
00:55 he plagiarizes someone else's story arc
00:57 but he does a pretty damn good job
00:59 expanding it retelling it he's just got
01:02 that genius so this was one of his
01:05 better works for me it's around the time
01:09 but I think he was being contracted too
01:14 much it was just too much on his plates
01:17 I was unable to keep one story finishing
01:22 well Tommyknockers anything awful
01:25 Tommyknockers story awesome now for
01:29 those of you haven't read this book or
01:31 seen the movie or even heard about it
01:32 you get you up to date on what's going
01:34 on because this is just a trailer to the
01:36 book this is a reason to buy the book
01:38 and potentially reason to see the movie
01:42 which has a fairly decent cast it's
01:45 about a medium budget movie but I mean
01:46 you wouldn't want Stephen King stuff to
01:48 be terribly expensive except for the
01:51 shining of which Stephen made a complete
01:54 ass out of himself by trying to take a
01:58 [ __ ] on Shakespeare aka Kubrick there's
02:01 a little country town and a new pawn
02:04 shop opens up and people are interested
02:10 people go down I want to see what the
02:13 old man's got for sale and each one of
02:18 the visits are pretty much the same
02:19 there's almost nothing in the store upon
02:23 each person's arrival except the one
02:26 thing that the person who's visiting
02:29 would die for and of course the thing
02:34 that they're looking at they know they
02:35 can't afford it I mean in their mind
02:37 they absolutely would do anything for it
02:40 and this gentleman behind the counter
02:42 knows that
02:44 but he's cool he wants you to have what
02:46 you want
02:47 so he says okay how much money on your
02:50 pocket oh I know a few bucks but once
02:53 you give me the few bucks maybe you can
02:56 just do me a favor okay
02:59 he's people willing to do any favors and
03:01 the favors he asks for at least
03:04 initially the very benign well you know
03:09 I won't I won't tell you then he does
03:13 tell so to do but it's something really
03:14 simple it might be like you know take
03:19 that bucket from right there and move it
03:21 over there and they're like really
03:24 really that's it and I have this thing
03:26 of my dreams
03:28 yeah now here's the kicker on the set up
03:34 of the trailer which should entice you
03:38 if you haven't read it the dude behind
03:42 the counter is the devil and those
03:46 little things that people are doing that
03:48 they don't think mean anything
03:50 no one's getting hurt starts a war
03:54 between the people of the city of this
03:58 town and the rest you'll have to watch
04:00 by yourself it's beautifully written I
04:05 think the book is beautifully written
04:07 because it's concise it doesn't go on
04:12 and on like the stand which has its
04:15 moments as well but the reason why I
04:19 want to make this video is that even
04:22 though this the the book needful things
04:24 is a fictional creation I think we all
04:30 have a need 'fl thing or things and I
04:35 believe that until we recognize the
04:38 lunacy of some of our devotions they
04:42 rule our lives and those who have those
04:45 things can rule our lives I've been
04:51 toying with the notion of creating a an
04:54 episode
04:55 called haves and have-nots my goal in my
04:59 mind would be to entice anyone who is
05:02 constantly strapped for cash maybe you
05:07 know living in a more urban district
05:09 maybe even dare we say ghetto district
05:13 it doesn't really matter you could be
05:16 living in a generally well accepted area
05:18 but you're just potentially more broke
05:21 than someone else or you could be fairly
05:25 well-off you could be upper-middle class
05:28 but you see stuff in the upper upper
05:30 class that you want now let me preface
05:33 this whole thing by saying some of you
05:36 know that lusting after something to be
05:40 an interesting goal for you and your
05:42 family and it's healthy you're gonna
05:45 save up your money and you're gonna buy
05:47 it when you have the money like gene
05:48 Simmons from kiss always says he said he
05:51 never has had a credit card he only buys
05:54 what he can afford
05:55 I think Groucho Marx said that as well
05:57 because the Marx Brothers living in New
06:00 York they didn't grow up in some super
06:03 affluent family plus ton of kids I'm
06:05 sure was very expensive so if you have a
06:09 grasp of what you're doing I'm not
06:11 addressing that particular situation
06:15 sometimes people will buy expensive cars
06:18 because it creates a payment and that
06:20 payment creates pressure and that
06:22 pressure creates mother of invention and
06:23 that can help you find your destiny like
06:27 I always said James Brown he's always
06:28 talking about the fact that he was broke
06:30 and he had to do something to make money
06:32 to feed his family and so here comes our
06:37 and B there's so many categories of
06:40 needful things aren't there when someone
06:44 gains a a skewed mind they can turn into
06:52 a hoarder because everything is a
06:55 needful thing some sort of traumatic
06:59 situation has got them in some bizarre
07:01 loop where they're trying to preserve
07:03 either the now or trying to recreate the
07:06 past
07:08 sometimes people go without and they
07:11 really suffer and sin when they get
07:13 plentiful again they hoard there's all
07:20 those stories that people have been
07:21 stranded on islands and then when they
07:25 come back to the mainland they're there
07:27 buying food and hiding it in places
07:28 because that's just what they had to do
07:31 and to make sure the Predators didn't
07:33 eat that little bit of food they were
07:34 able to find from some location we're
07:39 obviously not talking about that either
07:41 or what the hell is up with our lust for
07:45 objects what is that you see it in
07:49 animals all the time selfishness
07:54 sometimes plays a role between two
07:56 people sometimes it's someone wants
08:01 which you have and other times people
08:02 want to destroy what you have so you
08:04 can't have it anymore but it's something
08:07 bizarre something strange I had a cousin
08:12 when I was a kid he's a year and a half
08:13 older me and he was just an [ __ ]
08:17 from birth he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] from
08:20 birth I don't know what to tell you he
08:23 came over my house I think I was 4 3 or
08:26 4 years old and he got up on top of my
08:29 bed and he got my toys his father's a
08:32 doctor
08:33 the family went wanted for nothing
08:36 I mean awesome cars awesome house
08:38 awesome everything clothes food
08:41 everything kid got everything he wanted
08:44 to at his house but for some reason he
08:47 couldn't see me have something he didn't
08:51 have some food because my parents had
08:53 thought of a different toy that his
08:54 parents had thought of so he stood on
08:56 top of my bed I could still see it to
08:58 this day and he was I came here what the
09:01 hell he had in his hand and I'm such a
09:04 like a psychologist sociologist for
09:07 birth I'm just looking at him like I'm
09:09 studying the situation as a kid I can't
09:11 remember being angry or sad my father
09:15 caught him and he was angry first time
09:18 my father spanked the [ __ ] out of
09:21 other than his own child but my cousin
09:24 was standing on the bed
09:25 smashing toys on the hardwood floor and
09:30 he's just I am just picking up another
09:32 one
09:32 by him he was trying to break him
09:34 because in his infantile mind at 4 or 5
09:38 years old he couldn't see someone having
09:41 something he didn't have so that's sort
09:45 of a psychotic backside to the coin
09:47 we're gonna start this episode off with
09:50 us why do we want things that aren't
09:54 imperatives strategic resources of
09:57 course we need food we need water we
10:00 need shelter we need human interaction I
10:05 think at the tip tip of that we what
10:09 we're really going for is some form of
10:11 love with the human with the human
10:13 interaction right I mean if it times you
10:18 heard you know three's a crowd and it's
10:20 because some someone's a third person
10:23 and typically I dealt with this as a kid
10:25 typically one of the kids is insecure
10:28 can't see you at being a part of the
10:30 equation or the other person being a
10:31 part of the equation and he starts to
10:33 attack one of the other two I
10:35 experienced this too moving around as a
10:37 kid this weird kid named Charlie Charlie
10:41 was a little scrawny little kid and he
10:45 had a big brothers who or at least one
10:47 big brother I guess it must have beat
10:49 him up a little bit
10:50 probably nothing on nothing above the
10:52 normal but he joined my best friend and
10:56 myself and he just started losing it at
10:59 one point it was like one day walking to
11:01 school he just couldn't handle someone
11:05 else being this dude's friend it's
11:09 really interesting now there's some
11:11 things that I think are psychological
11:14 you know doctors neurologists have
11:18 studied the mind considerably in terms
11:21 of the electrical patterns that fire
11:23 when we eat things in just certain
11:26 chemical combinations obviously those
11:28 who manufacture drugs understand exactly
11:30 at least the inventors
11:33 exactly what parts of the brain are
11:34 being manipulated and thus they
11:37 handcraft the drug to do it usually
11:41 leaping off of some natural substance
11:43 some natural roots of natural mushrooms
11:46 some fungi somewhere and they study it
11:49 and they figure it out well how many
11:52 times have you heard the fact that you
11:54 know they know exactly how the
11:56 electricity fires through a synaptic Ulm
11:58 Esch when you ingest cocaine and then
12:03 they tell you that when you eat
12:05 chocolate it has very similar properties
12:08 I first I heard it as cocaine very
12:11 similar to cocaine and then of her
12:13 triggers somewhere to cocaine and
12:14 caffeine similar to cocaine and then he
12:17 told women recently and you know I don't
12:19 think you should take this to the bank
12:21 but they're telling you chocolate gives
12:23 a woman a sense of sexuality like she's
12:26 in a sexual situation you know if that
12:29 was the case I think most women who eat
12:31 chocolate would ravish their partners
12:33 and that's not occurring so it's
12:35 probably more like cocaine I want to
12:39 want you to keep that in your mind as we
12:40 parse through this there are chemical
12:43 you know combinations one two three
12:46 punches but happened inside your mind
12:48 that will create a diction for things
12:50 dopamine is a massive culprit of this
12:54 gambling and reward is a gigantic
12:59 dopamine pattern all right what happens
13:05 when you look at a shiny object if I
13:10 gave you a big chunk of glass a crystal
13:14 skull or something I say here hold this
13:16 take a look at this your mind starts to
13:19 have a unique experience doesn't it you
13:23 ever seen anything that was injected in
13:25 glass used to put roses inside you know
13:28 glass balls my my grandmother had a
13:31 bunch of these things it's brilliant
13:33 it's beautiful I love those things
13:35 colored glass sometimes they put sand in
13:38 there that hadn't been turned into glass
13:39 to make it look like a little beach
13:42 scene inside but now let's take it up a
13:45 notch
13:46 I'll give you a big diamond one that's
13:49 been cut like a baguette so it's got
13:50 just tons asides
13:52 its shining all kinds of overexposed
13:55 light into your retina going back to
13:59 your visual cortex super sharp
14:03 overexposed light particles little light
14:08 verbs of ether all particles I should
14:11 say and your minds getting stimulated
14:14 and you look at it and you can't get
14:16 enough of this stuff you could have a
14:18 little diamond in your hand maybe like a
14:20 two carat diamond and you just roll it
14:22 around in your palm with your finger
14:23 right and it's fascinating oh you have
14:29 to give it back unless you can come up
14:31 with like 20 grand
14:33 some people are super susceptible to
14:36 this stuff I was talking to a friend of
14:39 mine the other day about successful
14:40 couples and one of the I mentioned this
14:44 probably like four or five episodes ago
14:46 of course who knows when this one's
14:48 going to come out sprite ten and twelve
14:49 episodes ago but one of the things I've
14:53 noticed is the most successful families
14:56 I've ever seen do one of two things they
15:00 don't have any diamonds on their wedding
15:02 rings
15:02 neither the male nor the female have any
15:05 diamonds they just have a band and it's
15:08 usually pretty simple the second kind
15:11 are folks that married very young
15:13 follow the stereotypical this is what
15:16 you buy three months of your salary I
15:18 mean who do you think made that up who
15:21 do you think what God made that up if
15:22 you love yo mate you must spend you must
15:26 get in debt that from the second year
15:27 born right but they gave himself some
15:31 rocks back and forth guy always gets a
15:32 band looks like it had keys on it right
15:36 and the woman gets a big diamond she
15:42 feels like she's really got the right
15:43 man a winner she gets to parade around
15:46 and say I'm not broken goods I'm not
15:50 damaged goods I'm actually worthy of
15:52 being loved that's what the ring means
15:54 it's a big show-off game during her
15:56 cycle of insecurity
15:59 the guy's just sweating balls trying to
16:01 figure how to pay for everything but
16:04 eventually they replace her ring with a
16:07 nice band and why is that because the
16:10 woman starts to realize she can lose it
16:12 she can lose a 10 grand ring who wants
16:16 to do that needful things what's really
16:22 interesting about the book's title is
16:23 it's sort of a it's sort of a play on
16:27 words isn't it
16:28 if you watch the movie or read the book
16:31 you will realize that there's not a
16:33 single item that anyone ever acquires
16:36 from this gentleman who runs the pawn
16:37 shop that they really need
16:42 but what Stephen King does a brilliant
16:45 job doing is that the items of what
16:48 you're gonna have to read the book to
16:49 find out the items match the person
16:52 utterly perfectly I don't remember a
16:56 single item going into someone's hands
16:58 in that book where you couldn't believe
16:59 that they would feel this way about that
17:02 item and for that he gets an A+ just for
17:05 that part of the story alone and isn't
17:08 that the weirdest thing these folks
17:11 don't need these items but they feel
17:13 like if they don't have these items
17:17 they're gonna die especially especially
17:20 knowing the item exists now and it's
17:23 within reach but they can't get it
17:25 unless they compromise or do whatever
17:26 they need to do but until they knew it
17:28 existed they were living a perfectly
17:31 normal life and you might think I'm
17:35 obsessing about the book but it's really
17:37 the way it works isn't it how many times
17:40 have you had a shitty car and you just
17:45 you just concede it's a crappy car and
17:50 then you drive by a new lot a lot of new
17:54 cars you know a lot of new cars now it's
17:56 funny you know a new do deal used car
17:59 place and you're pulling it and you look
18:01 at a car and for whatever reason it's
18:03 brand new you really can't afford it but
18:07 now the sudden you're bullshitting
18:09 yourself about how you can't afford it
18:11 and if I do this pull up I built if I do
18:13 that extra thing there are a few
18:14 newspapers clean a few houses fix a few
18:17 cars polish a few guards whatever sell
18:19 stuff I got the house I could make a few
18:21 payments on this thing I have absolutely
18:24 done that twice twice in my life well
18:28 actually three times every time I bought
18:30 a car every time I bought a car
18:33 my third car I didn't quite feel that
18:35 way about it but I paid cash for that
18:36 car so it was a replacement for my
18:38 second car which had just ceased working
18:43 needful things how much have we suffered
18:49 because of this concept that we have to
18:52 have something that we don't need I mean
18:55 we've argued with our loved ones we've
18:58 potentially gone bankrupt lost
19:00 relationships because we went bankrupt
19:02 perhaps just lost relationships because
19:04 our dedication to this thing is so
19:06 insane that we weren't willing to
19:10 compromise we sort of got drunk we got
19:14 high on the a notion of this thing and
19:17 all of a sudden humanity falls out of
19:20 our body hmm I had definitely have
19:25 friends and family members who have
19:27 suffered from this greatly and with the
19:29 internet it got worse and worse and
19:30 worse
19:30 home shopping netwerk was the preview to
19:33 what the internet was going to be for 20
19:36 years
19:37 sadly a massive unconvicted pellet a
19:40 pedophile Jeffrey Epstein ran the Home
19:44 Shopping Network and people were buying
19:47 stuff and buying stuff and buying stuff
19:49 that they didn't need you know yours
19:51 truly I remember buying a fruit
19:54 dehumidifier I actually used it quite a
19:57 bit but just quality wasn't there
20:00 started not working I like dehydrated
20:04 apples that was delicious so I was
20:06 buying them by the bags and so I finally
20:08 started making it at my house but did I
20:10 need that and it wasn't that expensive
20:12 and I was rolling it but anyway I know
20:15 folks that have plenty of money and
20:16 plenty of space I mean up to a point but
20:21 they start filling their house with
20:22 things from their childhood
20:25 some of my family who had a great
20:29 childhood and so when the internet came
20:33 around eBay came around he would buy
20:36 items straight out of his childhood and
20:38 it's not that these items were I don't
20:41 know bad necessarily but they were items
20:44 that you would never use again as an
20:48 adult one of the items I remember this
20:52 particular individual purchasing
20:54 when you used to go to in fact I think
20:56 they still have them but when used to go
20:58 to music parks back in the day you would
21:01 have this machine that would bang out it
21:03 was like a little medallion like a
21:05 little coin a little sheriff's badge
21:07 thing and you could put in whatever you
21:10 want to put in there you just choose the
21:11 letters and pound it out it was pretty
21:12 inexpensive a few bucks or whatever if
21:14 even that maybe 25 cents 50 cents
21:16 depending on what decade you were using
21:18 this machine but you had a blank slug in
21:21 there and of course the center of the
21:23 slug has where you are so Six Flags Over
21:24 Texas Great America whatever and you
21:28 pound these things out well that's cool
21:31 at a park because you're at the park why
21:33 would you get these things because
21:34 you're actually somewhere you're Paragon
21:37 Park Worlds of Fun you're in various
21:39 places but to buy one and bring it to
21:44 your house well now what so I remember
21:49 looking at this thing I'm saying oh
21:50 you're gonna make these things in your
21:51 living room hey I'm in the living room
21:53 jtd 1999 he's like well I could get
21:57 slugs for it like great this isn't you
22:01 know if anything it's a decoration in
22:03 your house I get it but the amount of
22:04 money paid for it was way over
22:06 decoration in your house thing someone
22:09 might buy one of those old wooden Native
22:11 Americans that you would hold the cigars
22:13 out in front of a cigar shop
22:14 alright that's a decorative thing as
22:17 long as you don't pay too much for it or
22:18 if it's really beautiful you're paying
22:20 for it or it's an antique you're paying
22:21 for it perhaps you don't want it to be
22:23 damaged and thrown into a some junk pile
22:26 and you got the room for it and in your
22:28 house has that sort of ranch character
22:30 to it so it might make sense you
22:32 wouldn't put it in a house in California
22:33 though would you they have figured out
22:37 that
22:38 we are hunter-gatherers by nature and so
22:41 with that gene stuck deep down inside of
22:45 our bodies we have collectibles been
22:49 around for years right I was here in
22:55 California at the time but I remember
22:57 going back home and finding out that one
23:00 of my adult relatives I had been
23:04 collecting beanie babies from McDonald's
23:06 and this is a person old enough to be my
23:10 parent and I'm thinking really you're
23:13 collecting beanie babies like we don't
23:15 have a lot of little cousins or anything
23:16 that you know are you giving these away
23:18 to kids I mean you know what's the deal
23:21 no but just collecting them I almost got
23:23 them all this year and next year the new
23:25 ones coming around ironically Ty Warner
23:28 became one of my biggest clients for my
23:31 video game company I made millions of
23:33 dollars off that guy Thank You Jay any
23:38 of you've ever played a card game like
23:41 Magic the Gathering it's a collectible
23:45 game and it then it rewards you like the
23:48 pokemon cards and all that stuff it
23:49 rewards you with more playing power I
23:54 collected in 1996 the Star Wars decipher
24:00 cards which are utterly gorgeous let me
24:02 tell you it is probably the most
24:04 gorgeous cards I've ever held in my hand
24:06 and I've held several different types of
24:08 playing systems
24:08 I still have flight two full decks but I
24:13 was selling them at a I owned card games
24:15 calm way back in the day I was the first
24:17 person to buy that domain ever and I was
24:22 selling them out of my house
24:24 wholesale but I was a personal fan of
24:27 Star Wars obviously Star Wars had been
24:29 remade you know the first three hadn't
24:30 been made and none of the sequel stuff
24:32 had been redone any that kind of stuff
24:35 but I spent ridiculous money collecting
24:39 these for myself I loved this gambling
24:43 algorithm of opening a pack of cards and
24:45 looking for the the special card you get
24:50 a Darth Vader card man Darth Vader
24:51 cards were selling for fifty bucks a
24:53 card when that game was still active I
24:55 think I still have five to ten boxes
24:59 sealed from 1996 23 year old boxes some
25:05 reason they don't sell for what they're
25:06 worth it's nuts
25:07 strange we want control over ourselves
25:11 don't we we don't want to find ourselves
25:15 subservient to something we especially
25:17 don't need but we do and what is that
25:22 frailty in man what is that it might be
25:26 that if you think about it if you ate
25:32 some chocolate snorted some cocaine all
25:35 right so now you've got a biological
25:37 problem depending on how strong minded
25:40 you are and strong-willed you are in how
25:42 sensitive you are to the substance
25:46 you're ingesting you will either have
25:49 the ability to walk away or you're going
25:51 to be chasing that dragon for the rest
25:53 of your life but now what about
25:56 something that you haven't acquired yet
25:59 what's going on in the brain then now
26:04 gamblers I can understand gamblers
26:05 usually always have the same beginning
26:07 which is they were casually playing one
26:10 day they pulled the arm of the one-armed
26:14 bandit which now is just a little
26:17 digital button and they won they won
26:20 five grand or something there's some
26:23 equivalency to the 2019 of $5,000 a
26:26 mind-blowing amount of money and so then
26:30 forever if they're not strong-minded
26:32 they believe that that can happen over
26:35 and over and over again and every time
26:38 you go to a casino if you're willing to
26:40 stand around for long enough someone's
26:41 gonna win around you improve to you it's
26:44 possible and technically it is now again
26:49 coming from the video game industry let
26:50 me tell you how they work today they
26:53 have to win him certain amount and lose
26:55 a certain amount they have to lose more
26:57 than they win but only by a percent all
27:00 of the wins and losses are calculated in
27:02 a chip the day they're delivered
27:05 all you're doing is walking down all the
27:08 entries in the chip until there's a win
27:10 I know exactly how much that machine is
27:13 gonna take from the public and how much
27:15 it's going to give to the public that
27:16 day it arrives but I mean to the penny
27:18 they know and that's what the gambling
27:20 Commission wants to know as well I once
27:24 was told I'm not sure these statistics
27:25 are correct but as once told that craps
27:27 will allow you to win on average about
27:30 48 percent of the time
27:31 but even if you lose that extra 2%
27:33 you're gonna be broke most the time
27:35 because you're not gonna hit that you
27:37 know won in it was a forty eight nine
27:41 percent chance and that's on certain
27:42 odds you know of course what is this
27:45 thing well we have any we haven't
27:47 experienced yet but by god the thing
27:49 infects our brain you go down to your
27:52 local electronics store and you see a
27:53 giant 80 inch television if you're that
27:56 kind of guy your electronics guy you're
27:58 just dying over used to be when Apple
28:02 actually had a CEO that knew something
28:04 about computers a new computer would
28:06 come out you'd see it on on you know
28:09 Steve Jobs doing it on stage and then
28:12 you would go onto the website and you go
28:15 to customize and you look at that
28:16 computer you Jack it all the way up and
28:18 you just froth over $10,000.00 Mac you
28:22 could do the same thing for a nice
28:23 Windows machine these days some fifty
28:27 five hundred dollar machine it's got
28:28 everything in it comes with a vibe or an
28:31 oculus packed full of games or whatever
28:34 you're starting less for something
28:36 that's not even there yet well I think
28:39 we know what the answer is but it's
28:40 still a mystery we are having a fantasy
28:44 in our mind a prophecy inside of our
28:46 head of what our life will be when we
28:49 get it all the things we can do with it
28:50 if we just have it the hoarders that's
28:54 sort of the anthem of the hoarder
28:56 it's one of two things well I'm gonna
28:59 get around to using that don't want it
29:01 to go to waste
29:02 someone throw out a perfectly good thing
29:05 or now that I've got this my life will
29:10 be better and that's the one that
29:12 everyone else shares other than you know
29:14 outside of just being a hoarder
29:17 I had a friend of mine teach me and I
29:20 think I've only mentioned this one time
29:21 before but it's a good time to mention
29:22 this when it comes to food a friend of
29:25 mine who was very beautiful still is
29:28 beautiful body she told me I mentioned
29:33 this for a reason she'd buy something
29:35 really sweet something huge and she had
29:38 to rent a room for me for a little while
29:40 and she'd bring this home and I'd look
29:44 at her and I'd look at it and I'm like
29:46 are you changing your diet I mean are
29:47 you gonna get fat now what is this thing
29:49 you've brought and she looked at me and
29:51 laugh as she's finishing a couple bites
29:53 of it and she goes I just buy it so I
29:57 can throw it away a couple bites and I
29:59 just throw it away I get you know I'm at
30:03 the store I'm seeing something I really
30:05 want maybe something I could eat when I
30:06 was a kid so I buy it to satiate that
30:09 feeling bringing home I do in just a
30:12 little bit of it but I make it a ritual
30:15 to throw it away and then I rejoice that
30:16 I threw it away
30:18 art more often than not she let someone
30:20 else eat it take it to work give it away
30:22 to people right but she means she
30:25 doesn't keep it I started doing that a
30:29 little bit so I don't like to drink soda
30:32 that much on a rare occasion I will
30:35 drink a soda all the way through and it
30:36 it's weird drinking for me drinking a
30:38 soda takes me back to like the 80s when
30:40 I was a kid and I could just pound that
30:42 stuff
30:42 today I will every other one drink a
30:48 little bit of it
30:48 toss the can pour it out toss the king I
30:51 got my little fill and I confirmed that
30:53 it's way too sweet for me these days
30:56 what I think is great about the book
30:59 needful things if you read it and you
31:01 have the same admiration for the story
31:04 that I had reading it and still have
31:07 thinking about it in the past is when
31:09 you combine my friends regiment of
31:11 bhaiyya to get rid of the urge now
31:15 obviously if it's a super expensive
31:16 product we're not going to be using this
31:18 solution for that you know if you're
31:21 rolling in the dough I guess go ahead
31:22 and toss cash out the window I'm hoping
31:25 if you have a lot of money you can find
31:26 different ways of addressing your lusts
31:28 but maybe not
31:30 but when I think about purchasing
31:32 something now I kind of do a
31:36 metaphorical 10-second count I start to
31:41 try and be a cynical person about well I
31:43 think I'm gonna use it I think I'm gonna
31:45 get into this new thing this new hobby
31:47 I'm talking about but I probably won't
31:50 have the time it'll probably be
31:52 difficult to learn and so it's gonna be
31:55 resistance resistance resistance and so
31:58 half the time now I leave it in the
32:01 store if not more than that but I wasn't
32:03 like that before
32:04 I think about the needful things I think
32:09 about the lust algorithm of people
32:11 looking through this glass showcase at
32:13 the thing that they want in this book
32:15 and how foolish they seem wanting this
32:18 thing that they don't really need but
32:22 they feel more than need they feel an
32:24 imperative to have it I remember
32:27 someone's parents I remember who this
32:29 was specifically one of my friend's
32:32 parents was talking about a car and they
32:37 were saying you know this person was
32:38 very wealthy I've even got a very close
32:41 friend that's just recently replaced
32:43 like a 30 year old car by a 35 year old
32:46 car he got tired of spending money to
32:48 keep it running even to its minimum
32:51 amount but my friend's father said well
32:53 you know it's just a vehicle to get me
32:54 from A to B what do I care about
32:56 anything else
32:58 now typically in those families the the
33:01 wife will be allowed you know the
33:03 husband nearly insists that the wife
33:05 have a really nice car you know she's
33:06 always protected and and comfortable but
33:10 the guys sort of rough and he's like
33:11 yeah I'm gonna spend my money on
33:12 something else and that sort of rubbed
33:17 off on me for a little while I'm not a
33:20 big car guy I have a very nice car right
33:22 now but you know before that I just you
33:28 know I never been a hotrod kind of guy I
33:30 wouldn't turn it down but I wouldn't
33:33 spend a bunch of money on it unless I
33:35 just had money to throw away I don't see
33:37 myself trying a car that much my thing
33:39 is get to the destination let's do
33:41 something cool
33:42 once you become a musician boy you'll
33:45 get some serious serious introductions
33:48 to this course man if you play guitar
33:51 and you can't have enough of them I
33:53 swear to god this one makes a different
33:55 sound this is a fender this is the
33:57 Jackson this is an acoustic this is a
33:59 12-string this is a bass my hope in
34:04 making this episode even for my own sake
34:06 hearing my own voice go through this for
34:08 an hour is that we can start to identify
34:11 the archetype of this lack of control
34:13 and then start controlling it start
34:18 laughing at our own urges so that we
34:21 don't do it anymore I recently had a
34:24 situation where I was doing I've told
34:27 you guys a couple times I was working in
34:29 the the led the direct LED technology to
34:34 try and transform our movie theaters to
34:36 LED screens which is going to happen
34:39 I've been very privileged to be a part
34:42 of some of the first innovations in that
34:46 technology on planet earth so no matter
34:49 where it goes you know I may be one of
34:52 like four or five people who have
34:54 participated in engineering this stuff
34:57 to get it to really really work and it
34:59 really works and my god you will never
35:01 go to a projection theater again for the
35:03 rest of your life but what I started to
35:06 realize was that there was some
35:08 technology that was missing and just
35:12 being the kind of guy that just rolls up
35:13 his sleeves and gets it done I said you
35:15 know what I've got a pretty decent
35:16 background in electronics I need to
35:19 brush up on the latest and greatest
35:21 components that are out there and so I
35:24 got into the audrina systems I looked at
35:28 that I got a Raspberry Pi now I got a
35:29 couple raspberry PI's but I haven't been
35:31 able to hunker down and get it done
35:34 lately but I bought probably about I
35:38 don't know you'd back three hundred
35:40 dollars where's this stuff not a
35:42 terrible amount of money but I needed to
35:43 have a soldering station and I needed
35:47 just the you know bread boards and a
35:50 bunch of the basic components you know
35:51 huge array of reefs
35:54 resistors suffer various components and
35:57 I started really working with this and
35:59 getting really into it and I've thought
36:00 of my assign myself a project to create
36:02 a robot with a very specific feature set
36:06 that I think people are gonna really
36:07 like and I don't know of any of any
36:10 amount there that do this but then life
36:13 got busy and I started seeing myself
36:18 even though I kept it right in front of
36:19 my keyboard I started seeing myself you
36:22 know get to my desk and I'm working on a
36:24 bunch of stuff I'm traveling around the
36:26 world and I'm losing my connection with
36:29 this endeavor even the stuff that I had
36:32 taught myself for a year to get a lot of
36:35 these components to talk back to the
36:36 main ship and I'll put their serial port
36:39 out you know readings and all this other
36:40 kind of stuff I was losing it I'm gonna
36:43 have to go back and refresh myself it
36:47 happens to every single one of us
36:50 hobbies are interesting because they do
36:52 that and the more you experience that
36:55 hopefully you're developing a resistance
36:56 towards doing it again now one of the
37:00 phenomenons that it's gonna happen in
37:02 the younger you are listening to my
37:03 voice maybe you can avoid this problem
37:05 for yourself you will amass things when
37:09 you're young because you don't have
37:11 anything and you're gonna need some
37:13 basics a bed probably something to sit
37:16 on when you watch television if you want
37:18 to have any friends over it's sort of an
37:20 imperative your cooking supplies your
37:23 toiletries your cleanup supplies
37:25 whatever and then you'll start
37:27 garnishing your world with things that
37:29 are these elective things a stereo a big
37:32 TV maybe a TV in general I didn't have a
37:34 TV from 1987 to 1991 and even when I had
37:39 it I only watched it when I was sick or
37:41 recovering from am I getting my wisdom
37:43 teeth pulled I almost never watched my
37:46 TV at home but as you get older and you
37:49 hit your 40s you're probably going to go
37:53 through one or two phases you're gonna
37:56 keep doing it and you're gonna keep
37:59 running out of space in your house you
38:01 might even upgrade your house simply to
38:03 get more space to store your stuff like
38:05 George Carlin said back in the day
38:08 but a lot of folks that I am running
38:10 into today I am one of them we're
38:15 getting rid of almost everything except
38:19 the personal items of which are
38:21 irreplaceable and so you know old
38:26 computers old this old that your old
38:29 clothing you're never gonna wear again
38:30 that has no major significance in your
38:32 life potentially piece of furniture
38:35 that's just sitting there and doing
38:37 nothing it's not your grandmother's
38:38 something you bought a long time ago and
38:40 there's this weird empowerment to doing
38:44 that because you know sometimes you have
38:46 to move you have to move for all kinds
38:49 of different reasons sometimes all right
38:52 it's a lot easier when you have less
38:55 stuff isn't it
38:57 sometimes we gain things because we feel
39:00 like society thinks we should have them
39:02 there's a fairly new director in
39:08 Hollywood who I've actually met him one
39:11 time good guy means well but the story
39:17 went around fairly quickly after he shot
39:20 his first film he he made less than a
39:24 million dollars for directing it I don't
39:28 know if he got points on it or not
39:30 meaning a percentage of the take but he
39:35 went off and got married and had a kid
39:37 and bought several millions of dollars
39:40 worth of things because that's what he's
39:45 supposed to do in his position and
39:48 what's funny about it is if you look at
39:51 the older directors they've gone through
39:53 the same thing in some cases I've got
39:56 close friends of mine or famous
39:58 directors who bought a normal house in
40:02 fact no bigger than the one I'm sitting
40:04 next to and just kept their money and
40:07 we're smart he used it to pay for a bad
40:11 year when they didn't do anything at all
40:14 and people wish this other guy you know
40:18 the best of luck and they want you know
40:19 they don't want to see him
40:21 fail or anything but now people for a
40:23 while have been very concerned about his
40:26 future these things come with gigantic
40:29 payments and in them there's no way you
40:31 pay cash for it and so no one wants to
40:35 hear the negative story about that kind
40:37 of stuff
40:38 messing with your life and destroying
40:41 someone's otherwise wonderful life and a
40:43 very skilled mind that will be now
40:45 burdened from true perfection because
40:50 you're worried about your payments
40:52 you're worried about your payments what
40:55 I like about this problem for all of us
40:57 is that we all suffer from it
40:58 so as we have a joint conversation about
41:01 it we all know that we're victim to it
41:07 now the only people that I think are
41:10 going to pretend that they're not a
41:12 victim of it are folks that have never
41:13 had anything because of a poverty level
41:17 that has just been over them and they've
41:20 learned to perhaps they've learned to be
41:22 completely content with it but there's
41:25 still that pain inside I mentioned this
41:28 and Mister Rogers episode you know about
41:31 little kids feeling pain pain because
41:35 someone has something that they don't
41:36 have I sort of kicked this off but
41:40 there's the there's the age-old question
41:43 you know what is your favorite
41:44 possession in the entire world you know
41:48 some of them are you might have a few
41:51 different categories your most
41:53 sentimental object that you absolutely
41:56 have to have and those are usually
41:57 fairly sensible you know a pocket watch
42:01 from an old grandfather something from
42:04 your grandmother's these fairly
42:06 priceless things heirlooms in your
42:08 family a kitchen table could be an
42:10 heirloom that's been handed down I used
42:13 to have my old girlfriends kitchen table
42:16 in that house right there and it was a
42:18 150 year old table listen he'll probably
42:23 gosh maybe even 100 70 years old now I
42:28 understand I understand why someone
42:30 would hold on to something like that
42:33 and it's a fairly primitive design but
42:36 boy it didn't suffer it was built right
42:40 and it you know hangs on but it's those
42:46 other ones it's the other ones that we
42:49 don't need that are sort of funny now
42:53 sometimes you can buy an item that
42:55 really improves your life let's say you
42:58 did buy a big TV maybe even bought some
43:01 extra speakers on the side of it or
43:02 something like that and you have a large
43:05 family or you are just your pastimes are
43:10 in front of the television and you found
43:12 some good shows to watch maybe even just
43:14 watch old movies on DVDs or streaming
43:16 services and those are very rewarding on
43:19 this system that you buy well that's
43:23 probably not what we're talking about
43:24 even though you didn't need it you
43:26 bought it
43:27 and you really get your money's worth
43:29 that's the fun part when you really get
43:30 your money's worth out of an object
43:32 that's probably not we're talking about
43:34 it's the one that's sort of sitting
43:36 there staring at you the treadmill you
43:40 know the barbells that ever get lifted
43:42 all these things that are sort of well
43:44 my neighbor had it I had it I had this
43:46 vision of using it I'd never had any
43:49 history of using one before and for some
43:51 reason you thought that didn't matter
43:52 we're all guilty one of my favorite
43:56 possessions that I have let me just
43:59 share is my washer and dryer they're
44:03 whirlpools front loaders I bought them
44:06 December of 2002 to have shipped here
44:10 2003 they have not failed one day they
44:16 have worked perfect I mean I don't have
44:18 a lot of laundry but still it's six yeah
44:24 sixteen years later they're still
44:27 working like a charm I don't have
44:29 anything in my life
44:30 besides maybe a belt buckle that worked
44:33 16 years later you know saying it's
44:36 funny because my father has a very
44:38 similar set of models and for whatever
44:41 reason of course he's got a bigger he's
44:44 got a his wife and he
44:46 do do the laundry more than I do and so
44:50 he's had to replace some parts every
44:52 time he has to replace the part he sends
44:54 me an email with exactly where he got
44:56 the replacement part what was wrong so
44:58 that if it ever happens to me I know how
45:00 to get it for you know a few hundred
45:02 bucks and do the repair myself so I'm
45:05 not excited to do that but there you go
45:08 we want control I want you to have
45:11 control I want to have control because
45:16 money makes the world go around doesn't
45:17 it and then a sad little epitaph to our
45:20 world humanity doesn't make our world go
45:24 around I mean it does I'm sort of being
45:27 facetious but the layer on top the
45:28 intellectual layer on top we have so
45:31 convinced ourselves that we are so
45:33 civilized and but I think this has
45:38 probably been going back since the
45:40 beginning of time since any creature
45:43 gains a sentient mind how many times you
45:48 see squirrels grab things they don't
45:49 need and things are unedible birds build
45:53 nests out of all kinds of wild things at
45:55 least they keep most of them but we now
45:58 know the birds like was it pelicans not
46:03 pelicans bull crows they go off and grab
46:08 jewelry they like shiny things too there
46:12 was some story online some internet
46:14 thing online where I think I'm not
46:16 imagining this but I think a crow or
46:19 something like that brought a ring back
46:21 to a woman that she had lost it was on
46:25 video something like that we want
46:29 something special isn't that weird why
46:34 do we need these things I mean I think
46:37 the other bird was a seagull why they do
46:40 it - what would the world be like if we
46:43 didn't have needful things what if you
46:48 just got what you needed your strategic
46:50 resources and then anything else you add
46:52 is is allowable if you have the full
46:58 means of acquiring it
47:01 like not taking it out on on loan I
47:05 think it's amazing that when I was a kid
47:08 you were expected to be able to buy your
47:10 house you were expected to be able to
47:13 buy your car I guess I maybe I have to
47:17 go back to my father's age but it was
47:18 damn near the case when I was a kid I'm
47:21 not quite that old but now you are not
47:24 expected to be able to afford your house
47:28 your car your kids education these are
47:33 things that are out of financial reach
47:35 they have to be integrated into this
47:39 horrible demonic usery system where you
47:43 have an interest on your loan you're
47:46 paying not only the principal of the
47:48 loan but this interests the interest can
47:50 vary so you have to get these special
47:52 loans with locked interest rates I mean
47:55 typically your car payment doesn't
47:57 change typically your house payment
47:58 doesn't change but if you dare refinance
48:00 oh my god so we have some strategic
48:04 resources that have to go into this word
48:06 realm this debtors realm so you would
48:12 think that a lot of us would just simply
48:14 learn well I don't want any more of that
48:16 crap and I can't afford my house and I
48:18 can't afford my car in terms of its
48:20 total value so why should I spend money
48:23 on something that I don't need now some
48:27 of you may be yelling at the video
48:28 already saying but dude we need some
48:32 entertainment
48:33 I think I'm not talking about that in
48:35 some cases like I said if you buy the
48:38 television and you love it go for it do
48:43 we need two thousand dollar iPhones
48:45 probably not no matter what you think
48:48 about how much you use your phone the
48:52 idea is that these little absurd pieces
48:54 of plastic and metal and maybe in a case
48:57 of the broken iPhone glass which a glass
49:01 is better for recycling but Jesus they
49:03 cannot protect those screens to save
49:05 your soul I paying $50 for a [ __ ]
49:07 glass our plastic sheet that goes over
49:09 your glass
49:10 we're failing an IQ test here we should
49:14 have looked at those vendors and just
49:16 said you've got to be kidding me a piece
49:18 of plastic over my glass and you want me
49:20 charging fifty bucks well you're out of
49:22 a cent for this thing why don't I just
49:24 give you the keys to my car and my house
49:26 while you're at it right
49:28 our kids are strung out on stuff right
49:31 away aren't they every kid has a phone
49:33 so they have to have a phone every kid
49:35 has a some sort of gaming console well
49:38 they have to have one and then you have
49:40 to pay for the games if the phone exists
49:44 well then there's microtransactions to
49:45 death well I want this little app I want
49:47 this little app want this little app
49:50 there's the monthly fee to have all that
49:53 stuff there's not a game console in the
49:56 world that is an internet-based now
49:57 what's that costs well it's not fast
50:01 enough let's get a faster internet don't
50:03 have enough cable channels gotta have
50:04 that package this package this package
50:05 that package maybe you watch it and you
50:10 digest it and you get your money's worth
50:11 and maybe maybe not
50:15 let's say this is 350 million people in
50:17 the United States of America let's just
50:19 say a hundred and fifty of them are
50:20 adults I'm gonna - I'm gonna make a
50:24 prediction a silly little prediction I
50:27 think there's 50 to 70 million adults in
50:30 the United States of America who are
50:32 paying anywhere from 40 to $100 a month
50:36 for cable and they barely watch their
50:39 TVs but out of sheer habit out of sure
50:43 sense of need they continue paying for
50:45 that as if their television can't stream
50:48 something off the internet they're
50:49 already paying for anyway how many
50:53 people ever thought we'd get rid of our
50:54 home telephones I never imagined that
50:58 thought never entered my mind and quite
51:01 frankly I turned off my home phone
51:03 without really registering the moment it
51:07 was just I was upgrading my internet
51:09 package and they said do you want a home
51:10 phone I said no I don't need one and
51:13 then the only thing they do to keep you
51:15 having one is they'll tell you well it's
51:17 cheaper if you get the home phone with
51:19 it on Myon much cheaper like twelve
51:21 bucks cheaper all right whatever throw
51:22 it in there don't
51:23 stall it I mean I have no units that can
51:26 plug into the wall it's pointless so
51:30 there might be a layer of things that we
51:31 keep sheer out of sure habit we don't
51:34 need them anymore
51:35 TVs I think are different now because
51:38 everyone can see something on their
51:39 telephone it's only when you want to
51:42 have a group experience or perhaps an
51:44 enhanced theatrical experience at your
51:46 house that you feel like you have to
51:48 have one but now if you were in the 90s
51:51 in the mid 90s in the United States of
51:53 America at least there wasn't a guy on
51:57 planet Earth who was say under 40 who
52:00 hadn't thought about having a theater
52:03 room in their house they had a spare
52:05 bedroom they would think about how to
52:08 change that in fact when I rented this
52:09 house for the first month one of the
52:12 spare bedrooms had a theater room sorta
52:17 the smallest room in the whole house but
52:19 the guy got rid of the closet and he
52:20 built this sort of interesting wood
52:25 enclosure inside where the closet used
52:28 to be and there was a surround a
52:30 surround sound speaker wires hanging out
52:32 all four corners of the room
52:34 speakers gone a big cable hookup behind
52:38 where the TV used to be must have been a
52:40 big tube TV a lot of houses still have
52:43 these things it's a little man cave
52:47 what's interesting about the the sort of
52:52 the marriage where you have you know one
52:54 side of the spectrum you've got hoarders
52:56 and it's easy to laugh at those folks
52:58 sometimes or at least it's easy to say I
53:03 don't have any of those attributes and
53:06 then on the other side we have folks
53:09 that are you know like you and me where
53:11 we're just buying things we don't need
53:13 and one of the things that we say one of
53:17 the things the hoarders say like I don't
53:21 think I really buy anything out of the
53:22 store coz I go well if I don't buy it no
53:25 one will and it'll go to waste I don't
53:26 think that's that's not what I believe
53:28 if anything it's the opposite polarity
53:32 which is if I don't buy it now someone
53:35 else will buy it and it won't be at this
53:37 or won't be available ever and actually
53:40 happened to me I was buying robotic
53:42 equipment accidentally bought a chassis
53:45 that attaches to a larger unit and the
53:47 larger unit literally went out of
53:49 production so I got this bunch of weird
53:51 parts that won't fit on anything I'm
53:53 gonna have to kind of Frankenstein them
53:54 together but think about the idea of
53:58 seeing something on the side of the road
54:00 and picking it up and putting in your
54:01 car and bringing it home with the notion
54:05 that if you don't take it home then
54:07 it'll never be used by anyone when the
54:09 hoarder has eight absolutely established
54:12 record of not using anything and so it
54:15 truly dies in that little graveyard
54:17 around their house or inside their house
54:19 they have assured it to never be used
54:22 ever so I would have been better to
54:26 leave it on the sidewalk for someone
54:27 who's gonna grab it and use it for you
54:31 the non hoarder let's say it's one of
54:34 these situations of you need your money
54:38 you need it we all need it you either
54:43 need it for retirement or you need it
54:45 for some event or some other instantly
54:48 useful thing that you're going to use
54:50 your money for don't like your
54:52 transaction yourself to death I have
54:56 friends that self-employed extremely
55:02 stressed complain all the time about
55:05 that stress and how it affects their
55:08 life and how when I hang out with them
55:10 they can't do normal things because they
55:12 are just exhausted then they'll go off
55:16 and hang out with their buddy maybe even
55:19 rent a hotel room so they can kind of
55:20 jump off from the hotel room and go
55:22 party downtown and they blow a bunch of
55:25 cash on drinks and of course they're
55:28 creating memories I guess but it's a
55:31 real short-lived thing it's an it's an
55:33 overnight thing they come back they've
55:37 got a little bit of a shot of ah I feel
55:40 a little bit better but what they really
55:43 needed was ten days off and some remote
55:46 location that feels nothing like where
55:48 they live it could be the desert could
55:50 be an island
55:51 somewhere else their hometown it may be
55:53 far away like me but they can't afford
55:57 it
55:58 because they've microtransaction
56:00 themselves to death with all these
56:02 needful things and what I find
56:06 interesting is a lot of them have little
56:08 little catch phrases that rationalize
56:11 the temporary and these catch phrases
56:14 are extremely dangerous and when I
56:18 started season one I tried to call a lot
56:19 of them out and I'll mention them every
56:21 once in a while and one of the most
56:23 recent ones that I have heard which
56:27 facilitated substance abuse and
56:29 addiction and poverty was well no one
56:36 gets out of this place alive so I got to
56:39 do all these things because I know I'm
56:41 gonna die one day
56:43 again what that person really needs is
56:47 to say their money up say no and go get
56:51 that gigantic relief that they really
56:55 need and it will most likely result in
56:58 some inner reflection perhaps some
57:01 enlightenment of their own mind you know
57:03 sitting there going yeah you know I
57:04 really did need this I really needed to
57:06 get away from everything maybe it's just
57:09 getting away from all the electronics in
57:10 a particular city when I used to go stay
57:13 at my uncle's ranch in the Midwest man
57:17 just getting there was unbelievable this
57:21 this sort of electronic pressure on my
57:23 skull just disappeared when I laid my
57:26 head down at night to sleep the echoes
57:29 of my home world full of Internet
57:32 signals and radio signals and just
57:35 constant noise because you're in the
57:36 city it wasn't there and it's like if
57:40 you ever go to a concert and it's really
57:42 loud and you come home and you feel like
57:44 you can hear you know trumpets in your
57:45 head a tinnitus problem and you can't
57:48 sleep because you can't quiet your head
57:50 sort of a subcategory of that sometimes
57:54 those are the benefits you can get by
57:57 hunkering down and noticing the
58:01 businesses of the world have figured out
58:04 Mike
58:05 transactions you don't go in the
58:09 pawnshop and see that one thing that you
58:11 do anything for you see little things
58:15 all the time
58:15 well it's only a buck here how many
58:17 times have you had someone try to
58:19 solicit charity from you and they'll say
58:21 for the cost of a cup of coffee a day
58:23 you can feed a kid in Africa well maybe
58:28 for kidnap Raqqah you make the sacrifice
58:31 be aware that all those freaking
58:34 agencies have now been recently exposed
58:36 is probably human trafficking
58:38 organizations so be extremely carefully
58:40 give your money to I think the what was
58:44 it the amount of money that a charity
58:46 and nonprofit charity has to actually
58:47 spend on the on the actual problem that
58:50 they're solving is less than ten cents
58:52 out of a dollar Wow and a lot of them
58:58 been busted for not spending any money
59:00 on the problem it was a famous director
59:03 in Hollywood he did that one with a
59:04 tobacco nonprofit trying to claim he
59:08 created a nonprofit organization to get
59:10 rid of you know tobacco smoking and they
59:13 busted him after three years I think and
59:15 they found out that he was spending less
59:16 than three cents that was the highest
59:19 year he'd ever donated any money now
59:21 again I never sat in a court of law to
59:23 see the evidence on that but that's
59:24 certainly at the press it could be a
59:26 false accusation I guess but let's not
59:30 do that to ourselves Ross Perot had a
59:34 great thing he said when he was running
59:35 for president in 1991 or two whatever
59:38 that was he said you know saving up for
59:41 something that you want is probably one
59:43 of the best experiences you can have and
59:45 sometimes it's better than the
59:46 experience of actually buying the item I
59:49 know every single one of you if you're
59:52 over 25 you've bought something you
59:54 thought was going to change your life
59:56 and you get home and within 10 minutes
59:59 of unpacking it and setting it up life
60:02 went on and that object paled in
60:05 comparison to what you could have done
60:07 with the money say two weeks later when
60:09 you're you turn the key in your car and
60:11 it doesn't start and you got to spend
60:13 that same exact amount of money to
60:14 repair your car except you don't have it
60:16 anymore
60:17 tell your next paycheck
60:19 which means you're in trouble you got to
60:20 borrow money from somebody and lose face
60:24 with the world but you got that thing
60:27 right ladies they they nail you with
60:32 fashion how many pairs of shoes does the
60:35 average woman have how many pairs of
60:37 shoes does the average dude have we all
60:40 have our strengths and weaknesses how
60:42 many electronic pieces of equipment does
60:45 a woman have how many does it man have
60:47 you know the guy's a musician the
60:50 woman's got him dead to rights let me
60:52 tell you you will never be able to win
60:53 that battle our dreams can get involved
60:57 with this algorithm considerably right
60:59 you were gonna be a musician you know
61:02 you have the talent in you you might
61:04 even hear songs when you go to bed at
61:06 night you think god I just need to do
61:09 this one I'm a week I probably don't you
61:13 know I heard that drum solo but I sold
61:15 my drums I just need to get drums again
61:16 that's it get drums and all sudden
61:19 you're gonna be you know a fill-in
61:22 drummer for foreigner or something right
61:23 whatever your band you dig one of the
61:26 biggest solids I ever did myself was
61:29 starting to shelf
61:30 some of those old fantasies I just kind
61:33 of go well had I hunkered down you know
61:37 I would have done really well at a
61:39 particular point in my life I just had
61:40 to explain to my friend the other day
61:43 you know one of the one of the
61:45 shortcomings of yours truly is trying to
61:48 find time to interact with all my
61:49 friends because I'm just busy busy busy
61:53 I could be in my house and I'm just like
61:55 William walk I'm like I'm busy I'm busy
61:56 I'm making the next elastic God stop I
61:59 can't stop can't stop the talk they'll
62:01 call me at the wrong time I'm sleeping
62:03 at a weird time all these kind of things
62:05 right so you know my focus now is
62:08 screenwriting 24/7 among other things
62:12 and I'm trying to explain to my friend
62:14 cuz there was just some discontent with
62:18 my schedule
62:19 come on man is hanging out you got to
62:21 find the time to hang out this has got
62:23 to have this and I'm like I have all
62:24 those things I just don't have one you
62:25 have them which you're normal
62:27 I'm not sorry I was able to tell its
62:31 person I said look
62:32 when I was in my 20s in the 90s I came
62:37 extremely close to breaking through
62:41 where I wanted to break through the
62:43 music industry I was sort of trying to
62:45 EV towards some of the techno that I
62:49 mean I play country music and all kinds
62:51 of wild stuff I mean I just played
62:52 everything but I was trying to come up
62:54 with a some really dirty techno like
62:57 which ends up sort of selling like a
62:59 precursor to someone like Skrillex kind
63:01 of thing we didn't have all that
63:03 equipment to do all the wild [ __ ] he
63:04 does but I was creating this really
63:07 interesting darker techno I just kept
63:13 trying to crack it and crack it and
63:15 crack it but life just kept changing and
63:16 changing on the outside I had to study
63:19 you know all the stuff I've told you and
63:22 I always thought you know I'm young I'll
63:23 find the time da da da and there it went
63:27 now very satisfied with the stuff I
63:29 accomplished musically I'm not at that
63:33 fantasy level of being satisfied with it
63:37 but so now I'm 20 years older and now
63:42 I'm focused on something that I think
63:43 will not like the music thing has a
63:45 generational gap issue and so my my love
63:48 for music was always rooted in reality
63:50 of like okay who buys music kids in
63:53 their 20s what am i Who am I am I gonna
63:56 be in my 40s banging something out like
63:58 I said in the previous episode probably
64:01 not and why would I want to try you know
64:04 I need to make music that makes me feel
64:06 good and hey if someone else digs it
64:07 then good but screenwriting is something
64:12 that it's been a part of me for a really
64:13 long time almost 30 years professionally
64:18 I'd say 10 and I can do this until they
64:22 die just telling good stories it's just
64:26 telling good stories now one of the
64:29 biggest mistakes I think Hollywood makes
64:30 just to go on a digression for one
64:32 second is that they try to target
64:35 demographics too heavily and everybody
64:38 feels it no matter if they're an expert
64:40 or not they'll feel it they're gone I
64:42 see they boiled it down because they
64:43 wanted to have 12 year olds and they
64:45 didn't
64:45 just realized that 12 year olds aren't
64:47 idiots so instead of writing trite
64:50 dialogue they should just have boiled
64:53 down the story in a way that everyone
64:56 could understand it the movies I saw
65:00 when I was a kid some of them were sort
65:03 of for kids and some of them weren't and
65:04 I you know I saw Apocalypse Now and
65:06 warriors and my god you know just all
65:09 kinds of stuff is a nine-year-old and
65:10 alien the alien wasn't boiled down for
65:13 me but I saw it at nine years old and it
65:16 will stick with me for the rest of my
65:17 life I'm glad I saw it in the movie
65:19 theater with my dad so the reason I
65:22 mentioned that is that if you have a
65:23 needful thing that is related to an old
65:27 dream as long as your dream has a
65:30 realistic path to it let's say that you
65:33 know what I just said is your dream as
65:35 well you were younger and you wanted to
65:36 get into music
65:37 you know maybe whatever you're doing in
65:40 music still has an audience maybe you're
65:42 willing to put the effort in to get back
65:44 down to a younger audience maybe you
65:46 don't need any younger audience maybe
65:48 there are millions and millions and
65:51 millions of people around the world that
65:52 love which you can do when so you might
65:54 as well do it but then maybe your thing
65:56 is to throw away everything else or put
65:58 it on the shelf for a long time maybe
66:01 donate everything that was there when I
66:03 got to the point that I was going to
66:07 shelf music I again like I said in just
66:10 recent episode I had a $50,000 studio
66:13 and so I donated everything to friends
66:18 my brother-in-law and you know he was
66:21 able to sell some of it make some money
66:23 and buy some equipment that he needed he
66:25 kept some of the equipment because it's
66:26 universal for any musician and so you
66:29 know didn't go to waste I wasn't the
66:31 holder that kept it in the house
66:32 thinking well this is a perfectly good
66:35 thing it'll go to waste I had a buddy of
66:36 mine have all their instruments stolen
66:38 out of a studio my studio where else I
66:42 should say so their bass player and lead
66:44 singer didn't have a bass so I had a
66:46 bass guitar I wasn't using it I thought
66:49 I was gonna dig it in fact I bought it
66:50 off my buddy who thought he was gonna
66:52 learn it and then I just gave it away I
66:55 just mailed it to him
66:56 I said there you go it's a really good
66:58 Ibanez based
67:00 so anyway I hope this connects with you
67:03 guys a little bit it's a problem I think
67:05 every single one of us have we want
67:08 control so if you're suffering from this
67:12 I want you to perk up your ears and perk
67:15 up your emotions and your feelings every
67:18 single time you feel the urge to get
67:20 something that is a little elective and
67:23 I want you to think about the times when
67:25 you can't buy the things that you need
67:26 the car doesn't start the tires flat
67:31 something you know you need a suit
67:34 because the job you're going to
67:36 interview for need you to wear one you
67:39 can't have it because you don't need
67:41 money so play all those things back
67:45 every single time you're standing in
67:47 front of an object at a department store
67:49 or some other place car dealership
67:51 whatever and just say can you go a
67:54 little bit further with what you have
67:56 can you save up all the money to buy it
67:59 outright and is that a wise choice for
68:02 you as well so you've kept that money
68:05 microtransactions be very aware that
68:06 they are now bleeding us dry
68:09 you know it's death by a thousand you
68:12 know scratches sometimes the bigger
68:17 thing is the true epiphany moment of
68:19 your life you could travel someplace on
68:21 a vacation and realize that you should
68:23 live there and so you just look for jobs
68:28 in that area boom your life changes I
68:32 took a vacation to California in June I
68:37 believe of 1987 I wanted to know if this
68:42 place was for real and if possible find
68:45 a job and I found both and so and I
68:49 moved here to see two months later I was
68:53 absolutely estatic I had a job lined up
68:56 and a place to live lined up and it
69:00 worked out but if I hadn't saved up my
69:03 pennies I wouldn't seen this place food
69:08 for thought
