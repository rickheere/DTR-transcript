00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts on this late evening
00:34 recording here it's about two o'clock in
00:37 the morning so I wanted to start off by
00:39 just saying that one of the things that
00:42 keeps the show going is my need to chew
00:47 up you know deep thinking you know
00:50 sometimes not everything we talk about
00:52 is extremely deep but part of it is just
00:55 you know roaming around your head it's
00:58 just it's yours so you got your brain
00:59 and I love the fact that you guys want
01:02 to join me in the journey and when I see
01:05 really great comments are any comment in
01:08 general I know that you guys have
01:09 experienced the the ride and I hope
01:13 you're having fun again suggestions are
01:17 always welcome and there's all kinds of
01:19 ways to communicate with me the email
01:23 address you can communicate with me on
01:24 those youtube at deep thoughts radio
01:26 calm that comes straight to me the other
01:29 way is to put it in the comments the
01:31 other way is to go to the LOC Facebook
01:33 group and get in there and you can
01:36 private message me or friend me my
01:38 account is called deep mind I did try to
01:40 call it deep thoughts but someone else
01:42 already had it so that's why it's kind
01:44 of a narcissistic little name there I
01:46 did be to do that and I just saw
01:48 something the other day that deep mind
01:51 is somebody else who's involved with
01:54 some number 17 things and so I was like
02:00 wow that's crazy I'm surprised people
02:01 haven't started you know pounding me
02:03 personally as if I'm that person so
02:06 today I thought I'd cover something that
02:10 I just haven't carved sitting on my desk
02:11 and I'm importing in last night's video
02:14 and I just thought you know what can I
02:20 do today because there's no there's
02:22 almost never any preparation some of you
02:24 can see that some reason my cigar it's
02:28 got a really blocked cap I'm digging it
02:32 out my fingernail here you don't want to
02:34 block cigar because
02:36 it will make your mouth hurt after a
02:40 while because you're sucking too much
02:41 you don't even realize it until the
02:43 inside of your mouth starts to hurt so
02:45 I'm gonna go get my perfect draw and
02:47 poke a big-ass hole in this thing and
02:49 I'll be right back for those of you
02:51 don't know what I'm talking about
02:53 it's this little ninja sword it's made
02:56 by a dentist in Orange County this is
02:58 like the second version of it he's very
02:59 serious about this you just unscrew one
03:01 side pull out the little ninja sword
03:04 which has these little teeth on them I
03:06 think you can see him in the camera a
03:08 block of day and kind of see it begin to
03:11 focus for a second she just poke it into
03:14 your cigar you gotta be very careful not
03:15 to go sideways otherwise you will
03:17 definitely destroy the stick yeah this
03:21 has a branch in it or something and it
03:25 goes in one way and it just pulls out a
03:30 little stick or whatever's in there he's
03:32 probably bit off before you put it in
03:34 your mouth see if I can grab whatever
03:37 the hell that is this is an awesome
03:40 little stick I don't even know what the
03:42 hell this is definitely something in
03:45 this one he's all smoked fantastically
03:49 and this is a which is called a Hoyo
03:53 it's got a band like that when they're
03:57 properly humidified pretty amazing
03:59 sticks all right being psychic why have
04:07 we not covered this in the past
04:09 well you know I've touched on it a
04:12 little bit for any of you who saw my
04:16 episode on horoscopes spelled with an H
04:19 or WH I really don't like people telling
04:24 other people what their life is gonna be
04:27 like but being psychic is several
04:31 different things right it could be being
04:34 psychic can be someone who claims to be
04:36 able to you know see your past see what
04:40 you're all about and tell you you know
04:43 hey this is going to happen to you in
04:45 your life
04:46 and being psychic could be someone who's
04:49 like back all in my face what does that
04:54 guy John did words used to have the show
04:58 on TV I don't know where that guy's
04:59 anymore of course I don't watch TV so he
05:01 could still have a raging show and I'm
05:03 treating him like he's got an obituaries
05:05 already but he would be able to talk to
05:09 dead people that was this thing will go
05:14 through these then there's sort of the
05:18 psychic that works with police officers
05:19 and they can touch an object like the
05:25 movie dead zone with Christopher Walken
05:27 based on the book by Stephen King and
05:30 they can see things you know that that
05:32 object experienced and then help
05:36 potentially police officers find a body
05:38 find something and it's fascinating
05:42 isn't it I thought about doing one on
05:45 telekinesis as well I just don't know if
05:49 there's a an hour's worth of it but
05:53 definitely being psychic is something
05:55 that people have claimed to be able to
05:57 do for years there's the sort of cousin
06:02 of being psychic which I've talked about
06:04 several times which I won't cover in
06:06 this episode which is people being able
06:08 to see your aura I do think that that's
06:11 fairly legit but being psychic hmm
06:16 because there's there's those those are
06:19 the big groups right someone who can
06:21 read your fortune which at the same time
06:25 you're saying they can see your past in
06:26 most cases the ones that are reading
06:29 your palm and all that kind of stuff or
06:32 your tarot cards or your your what is it
06:37 the read the tea Leafs that's another
06:40 one and then there's John Edwards who
06:42 reaches out and you know communicates
06:46 through what used to be exclusively a
06:49 psychic or sorry a seance situation like
06:52 the woman who owned the Winchester house
06:55 the wife of you know mr. Winchester who
06:58 thought she was haunted by all the
06:59 deaths Kyle
07:00 by the Winchester rifle during the Civil
07:02 War who somehow connected that with
07:05 building her house must have been a real
07:06 estate agent or or a construction agent
07:10 or a banker who got into that one but
07:12 she was SuperDuper into seances and she
07:17 went crazy she you know kept building
07:19 this house in San Jose California which
07:22 I've been to numerous times probably at
07:25 least six times because my family would
07:27 come out and go well what can we see you
07:29 know it was like hey we got a Winchester
07:30 house it's a trip man
07:31 staircases that go up the ceilings doors
07:34 that opened the walls
07:36 she had an efficient with the number
07:39 thirteen so you would look at the any
07:41 rain drain or a tree during Jesus a sink
07:44 drain count anything in the room and it
07:48 was always 13 so she was sort of that
07:50 satanic stuff so it you know we're gonna
07:54 talk about could it be legitimate well
07:57 my first impression is absolutely could
08:00 be legitimate
08:01 however when connected to things like
08:05 astrology numerology tarot cards tea
08:11 Leafs all that kind of stuff palms the
08:14 design of your palms supposedly where
08:16 God hides all of your destiny I don't
08:19 believe that for a second and there have
08:22 been again numerous experiments with
08:25 least tarot card reading where people
08:28 were asked to read the opposite result
08:30 of the card to their subjects their
08:33 weekly subjects of which they refused to
08:35 do because they thought they're going to
08:37 destroy these people's lives then a week
08:40 later the people came in and said my god
08:44 the all the reading gave me last week
08:47 was the most accurate reading you've
08:48 ever given me and the guy in it was in
08:52 the East Coast he was like a Harvard
08:54 professor or something
08:55 he quit immediately he never did it
08:57 again because he said oh this is all
08:58 crap but being psychic hmm let's tackle
09:05 these one at a time here I think we'll
09:08 end with the talking to dead people one
09:11 because I think that's more interesting
09:12 so
09:13 push that a little bit out but let's
09:16 talk about the one let's start off a
09:19 little spicy one the idea that you could
09:21 touch an object and get a vision
09:26 from the object of where it was who may
09:31 have wielded it who may have owned it
09:32 let's say it's a a weapon let's say it's
09:36 an article closing clothing from either
09:38 the victim or the killer you know the
09:41 truth is is that you have let's talk
09:45 about the people who claim to have this
09:47 capability you know as well as I do that
09:51 there's enough failures from psychics to
09:54 say it doesn't work any one of those
09:56 things I just said it John Edwards has
09:58 failed miserably at times people who
10:01 help police officers find things have
10:03 also failed more times than they
10:05 probably have succeeded and there's just
10:07 been absolute hoaxsters out there that
10:08 makes stuff up people have gone up to
10:12 psychics on television shows and said
10:14 okay here's a picture of a little girl
10:17 she disappeared what happened to her and
10:21 the psychic will look at the picture and
10:23 tell a huge story about how they were
10:26 molest kidnapped molested killed maybe
10:29 even held for several years and then the
10:32 woman holding the picture goes nope
10:34 you're totally wrong it's me as a child
10:37 you're a fraud ding you're out the door
10:40 right so we've seen that too but what
10:44 makes someone claim to be psychic in the
10:47 first place because there has to be a
10:49 psychological profile that makes this
10:52 occur well you probably have if this can
10:57 happen at all you will have legitimate
11:01 people who can do it or or who have done
11:05 it what we try to say that and then you
11:09 have people trying to get attention
11:10 because they have that need and then you
11:15 might have just a straight-up snake oil
11:18 salesman a shyster a conman con woman
11:23 the confidence trickster and they
11:28 they're just trying to make money so
11:32 that's how they start off now let's talk
11:35 about the the negatives before we talk
11:38 about the positives the conman well
11:43 there are definitely factions in the
11:45 world that teach this to their kids it's
11:50 an art and it used to be more prevalent
11:53 but you know what's really interesting
11:56 about is you can go to palm readers and
11:59 I used to see him all the time at Venice
12:00 Beach and there was usually just they
12:03 had a certain type of personality of
12:06 clothing I think in the ancient past
12:09 there was you know like the gypsies were
12:11 always known for this kind of thing and
12:14 that's probably more stereotyped than
12:16 reality but yeah it's just it doesn't
12:17 matter it doesn't matter if a particular
12:19 race simply perfected this and and
12:22 passed it down there may have been some
12:25 truth to it there may still be some
12:26 truth to it right Who am I to judge
12:29 right but we know there's confidence
12:31 tricksters out there con men that do
12:33 this kind of thing a part of it is an
12:37 element of entertainment and I mentioned
12:40 this every single time because this is
12:42 the first time I ever heard a
12:43 counter-argument to psychic abilities
12:46 tarot cards because in the movie the
12:49 second movie that Prince ever made the
12:51 musician was called under the cherry
12:53 moon and he gave Mary and Cherie equals
12:59 their name a box of beautiful tarot
13:03 cards at her birthday party in the south
13:05 of France and then they she just held on
13:10 to him but then they bump into her
13:12 mother and another woman that prince was
13:13 actually being a gigolo for and oh you
13:16 got him terrible crush do you read tarot
13:17 cards and he says am I just because I
13:21 don't know if I believe any of this
13:22 stuff I think you just tell people what
13:23 they want to hear and they make it
13:24 happen I thought that was simple and
13:27 beautiful okay how many situations have
13:31 you known where that's been the case for
13:34 you without any psychic thing around you
13:37 somebody simply said well here maybe
13:40 you're unhappy
13:41 or you're just in sort of a dead-end
13:43 situation in your life you're not
13:44 unhappy but you're ready for a change
13:46 and someone says to you all why just go
13:52 do it do what do the thing you love but
13:56 that thing I love yeah why not what's
13:59 stopping you and then you you know you
14:01 either hear the person you do it
14:02 yourself and you're like okay I never
14:05 really thought about just doing what I
14:07 want to do and so that could be a push
14:13 like my cousin you told me why are you
14:15 going to college you already know how to
14:17 do everything you love to do you're
14:19 making tons of money just keep doing it
14:21 and he was right so maybe the con man
14:25 starts off as a deliberate con and this
14:29 would be if they had no family that did
14:31 it or no friends that did it no mentors
14:33 and they're just trying it they look on
14:35 the internet they figure out the cards
14:37 and they say what they want to say okay
14:40 but then what happens is that what they
14:43 find out is that the person is actually
14:45 taking more risks in life and having
14:47 more success in life by being told
14:51 whatever you make up off the cards off
14:54 the die off the tea Leafs or whatever
14:57 maybe you can sense just by pure logic
15:00 that they're about to take a senseless
15:02 risk and so you're reading that off of
15:04 them as a warm reading and will get the
15:06 warm and cold readings in a second and
15:09 you go it looks like a pretty dumb idea
15:12 so let me just throw out some bias
15:15 without them knowing and blame it on the
15:17 cards blame it on the tea Leafs and then
15:19 they go off and they're a little bit
15:20 careful instead of getting married
15:23 overnight by some guy they met in Vegas
15:24 or whatever they take a little bit of
15:27 caution find out that they were just
15:29 infatuated and life is a little bit
15:32 better and they find out boy if I had
15:33 jumped on that I would have suffered
15:36 hardcore they were a con man they were
15:37 trying to steal my money or whatever and
15:39 they will say that the psychic was the
15:43 reason why they're not lying it's just
15:46 the cause and effect model that was the
15:49 reason why they were told what they were
15:50 told was a little bit more direct than
15:52 indirect
15:54 meaning indirect being psychic direct
15:56 being just wisdom from the person
15:57 reading to you because think about it
15:59 what's the difference between a psychic
16:01 who reads your palms every day or your
16:03 tarot cards or whatever and a
16:04 psychologist or priest a good priest
16:08 doesn't touch kids well they just see
16:12 thousands of instances of life every
16:15 single day a month and year and year and
16:18 decade and what have you and so they
16:19 have a bunch of wisdom you could
16:20 probably just sit down with them and go
16:21 okay here's the situation I got this
16:23 this isn't is give me your opinion
16:26 instead of saying I'm gonna keep my palm
16:28 to myself you know to do the card thing
16:30 I'm really paying you for your wisdom
16:32 people do it all the time for shrinks
16:34 that don't do anything for them
16:36 you're my psychologist hey like that
16:39 alright so maybe in the con man's eye
16:45 you know there's my philosophy of how to
16:48 bill for your time is what I call the
16:50 displacement payment method which is if
16:53 you displace me from making money you
16:55 pay for my time that's it you don't
16:57 waste my time I don't charge any money
16:59 if you want my time a hundred percent
17:01 then there's a price for that and I love
17:04 to give you a service right and I like
17:06 to get paid but that's just a fair way
17:09 to do it so same thing applies to the
17:11 psychic they're there for an hour
17:13 whatever time you're buying up I don't
17:15 know how much the that sells there's
17:16 actually a psychic place less than a
17:19 quarter mile for me and I I feel I've
17:22 never gone in I should probably go in
17:24 just for the experience though they
17:25 gotta be fun right now the other thing
17:28 that the comment does is definitely
17:29 create a dependency come back next week
17:32 come in a couple days we'll see how it
17:34 works out and so you got to be careful
17:37 because they'll bleed you dry right but
17:39 maybe a little bit of entertainment
17:40 maybe you just need someone else to talk
17:42 to and it just feels good because guess
17:44 what you're human being and they're a
17:47 human being and their experience in the
17:50 human condition because of their job is
17:52 really developed and I've talked to
17:55 people who take it absolutely seriously
17:57 and they will only go to one person
17:59 because they trust that person and I
18:01 know other people that do it just for
18:02 entertainment Venice Beach it's usually
18:04 entertainment hey you know they only
18:07 want five bucks
18:07 to read my palm for about 15-20 minutes
18:10 to talk to me and you'll have more fun
18:13 in that 20 minutes then you'll have
18:15 spending 50 bucks down the street on
18:17 some shitty dinner right
18:19 so that's your total like almost a
18:22 control case they don't have any
18:24 capabilities whatsoever they can
18:27 definitely read the cards properly they
18:29 can even read your palm based on all the
18:30 rules and tell you a bunch of stuff so
18:33 they're following a discipline but in
18:36 the end maybe what they have to
18:38 contribute is more inside their soul
18:40 than any other external influence okay
18:45 now let's say you're going to talk to
18:49 someone who is just going to talk to you
18:51 you go into their house there's no cards
18:53 there's no mechanism between the two of
18:56 you no astrology no numerology which is
18:59 completely arbitrary and astrology in
19:02 astronomy or astrology and numerology is
19:06 a it's one of those games where you ever
19:11 you ever played the game where someone
19:13 says okay it's an it could even be a
19:15 meme that does it right they say okay
19:16 take care take 22 and then add the year
19:20 you were born then subtract this then do
19:22 this and do that if you're a
19:23 mathematician you can automatically see
19:25 that everything you've added to the
19:27 equation or subtract you from the
19:29 equation is then reacted to the equation
19:31 by the time it's over and they know
19:32 exactly how to get you to a particular
19:33 number because they've subtracted out
19:36 all of your additions and then forced
19:38 you to either add or subtract something
19:40 else and it's always the same year or
19:42 something like that right or they can
19:45 get you to a number that's a part of
19:46 your life by having you just use math
19:49 that's logical to get to that year so
19:52 astrology is built that way you can
19:55 achieve anything that you wanted to
19:56 achieve numerology oh my god meteorology
19:59 has so many different calculators pick
20:02 your pick pick your sauce right that's
20:05 why when people use numerology and the
20:07 17 movement I just want to throw up and
20:09 so sad but anyway back to the woman on
20:12 the sofa it's usually a woman because
20:14 she's got the right brain and usually is
20:17 more empathetic
20:18 you know I I don't know if other than
20:20 John Edwards I've never seen a male
20:23 psychic you know that claims that
20:26 they've got this that I you know I
20:28 probably should have looked up some
20:29 names is probably good I don't mention
20:30 name so don't slander anybody but it has
20:33 been some very famous female psychics
20:36 out there but now here's my thought with
20:39 that my thought with that is which is
20:43 going to feed into Edwards situation as
20:46 well which is very simple there's either
20:50 two type of people that would do this in
20:52 my opinion one would be the person who
20:54 is straight up a conman with a different
20:57 game it is more of a psychological
20:58 session it is beneficial to you because
21:01 they're going to be reading your
21:02 situation and kind of you know doing
21:04 what the psychic does but with the
21:05 mechanism on a table so I think that
21:09 that I don't know what the percentages
21:11 would be I don't know but what I think
21:15 happens with some of these individuals
21:17 is that they they have done it at some
21:23 point in their life they have proven to
21:26 themselves that they have this ability
21:28 every once in a while perhaps under
21:31 certain conditions you know that maybe
21:34 they're not psychic on a roller coaster
21:35 but when you're in a nice calm room no
21:41 interference and they get a time to be
21:43 with the human being they're able to
21:46 dial in and they do start to see things
21:50 but the problem is when they turn it
21:54 into a business that's where it gets
21:56 challenging well think about it what
22:01 what singer okay could sing eight hours
22:05 a day I don't think any of them can at
22:09 all they save their voice until the to
22:11 our concert and then they're done and
22:14 they got a they probably barely talk
22:16 until they get to have till they have to
22:18 sing again right or warm up or whatever
22:19 backstage because it's a very exhausting
22:24 situation well now imagine that you do
22:29 have this
22:30 receptacle capability of taking in
22:34 information from spirits on the other
22:38 side
22:39 perhaps echoes from the person that
22:42 you're talking to or some other thing
22:46 and under certain circumstances it works
22:50 it has worked
22:51 maybe it's worked dozens and dozens of
22:54 times so you start to gain confidence
22:55 you have this capability because you
22:57 have been able to make predictions and
22:59 they work and so then you open a
23:02 business and you get known for this
23:04 however would you ever want it what
23:07 would you do if you had a session where
23:11 you're not getting anything I mean
23:13 nothing I've never heard of a psychic
23:16 admitting that they don't have it
23:18 now these 1-800 numbers of the Easter
23:21 one 900 numbers used to have you you
23:23 better believe they have a giant
23:24 computer with almost like a knowledge
23:27 base lookup system or they have some
23:30 cards or they have like a script in
23:32 front of them that's allowing them to
23:34 feed you something so you may want to
23:37 rethink that particular situation I
23:39 almost guarantee you there's someone in
23:41 your in your town that probably has more
23:45 capability than someone on a one in one
23:48 900 number right I don't even know if
23:50 those things exist anymore but so
23:54 therein lies the dilemma to say that you
23:58 could start a business and maybe even
24:00 charge more money to say okay here's the
24:02 thing I have off days and I have on days
24:05 I have on hours and off hours and it's
24:08 not like I'm going to tell you that it's
24:10 going to be from 10:00 to 12:00 I'm just
24:13 gonna be at my house and or my place of
24:16 business and when I feel hot when I feel
24:18 like the universe is talking to me I'll
24:21 text you then you come over you pay a
24:24 premium price because you're only ever
24:27 gonna get me when I'm warm but I'm
24:30 really you know feeling it that would
24:34 make that be much more legitimate to me
24:37 personally than to say I always see
24:40 things all the time and I can always
24:42 make sense out of it such that you
24:43 should part with money
24:44 and go live your life as a result of
24:47 what I say again I have to psyche
24:50 capabilities that I know of
24:51 although I've had some had some really
24:55 you know well I had one experience I've
24:59 said it probably half a dozen times on
25:01 episodes in the past let me just share
25:03 this real quick to give you a
25:05 distinction between being psychic I
25:09 guess and maybe what I experienced I
25:12 don't know it what I did was I predicted
25:15 the future in a very intimate way
25:18 in fact it's happened twice probably
25:20 worn out but at least two that were
25:22 pretty intense right I was I think 11
25:27 years old I had just moved to
25:28 Massachusetts I was unpacking some stuff
25:32 upstairs and it's just myself a woman
25:38 who was the wife of my dad's best friend
25:40 he owned the house we were just renting
25:42 a room for a few months while before we
25:44 found our apartment and her son who was
25:48 five years old plus a beagle dog and so
25:52 I'm just literally I just got there I'm
25:55 just unpacking a box and I've taken the
25:57 box and lean it on its side so I like
25:59 little shelves and then I put my stuff
26:01 in there get up I'd run down the
26:03 staircase I turned the corner that's
26:06 kind of a ton of a Barney house it was
26:09 in Haverhill Massachusetts but I walked
26:12 through this kitchen and as I remember
26:14 because I was 11 it was a pretty big
26:16 kitchen with probably 15 20 foot
26:18 ceilings and this sort of wraparound
26:20 counter and the mother was mixing up the
26:24 cheese into macaroni and cheese that
26:26 last step you do right and she's mixing
26:30 this up making this up and I walk in the
26:32 room but I'm excited because it's
26:34 macaroni and cheese right and she goes
26:36 you want any macaroni and cheese and I'm
26:38 like do I ever want some macaroni and
26:40 cheese step aside lady here's the thing
26:44 no sooner did that then I walked through
26:47 the door jamb of the kitchen my vision
26:49 starts going purple nice to have this as
26:53 a kid a lot and it wasn't from standing
26:55 up I would just be sitting on the sofa
26:57 and
26:57 be looking at the room and everything
26:59 goes this deep purple was crazy it was
27:02 weird but this purple thing happened and
27:04 I start getting like a little
27:07 light-headed but it wasn't the feeling
27:09 you get when you stand up and you get
27:11 lightheaded that's that's a different
27:12 feeling that's more like you're about to
27:15 completely lose control of your body and
27:17 potentially pass out I had I had no pass
27:20 out thing but I started holding my head
27:25 and I'm with my left hand and my left
27:29 and there's a door to the kitchen over
27:30 here and I just said she goes are you
27:33 okay
27:34 and I said someone's gonna be at that
27:36 door and they're gonna be hurt in like a
27:40 few seconds later
27:41 Bam Bam Bam Bam the door bangs her
27:43 five-year-old son had been bitten on the
27:45 stomach by the dog because he's probably
27:48 beating up the dog and she pauses and
27:51 looks at me and the doors banging and
27:53 she can hear her son crying on the other
27:55 side of the door and I just said that
27:57 and so she's pausing and then it took
28:00 her like two seconds three seconds to
28:02 throw the pan down and go to handle her
28:03 son you needed to go to the hospital for
28:05 stitches weird right the second time i
28:09 SuperDuper remember this and i still
28:11 told this story several times so i just
28:14 want to throw this out there so you kind
28:15 of know where my mind's at it being
28:18 skeptical of other people especially
28:21 September 10th 2001 I'm in bed with my
28:26 girlfriend it's her place I live
28:29 literally like a country block down the
28:31 street and we're like literally up to
28:34 our necks in the comforter and for some
28:38 reason we haven't turned the lights out
28:39 like she isn't wandering on her side I
28:40 have one on my side and I'm looking at
28:43 the ceiling and I said to her I had this
28:48 feeling that something horrible is about
28:50 to happen and then just as I said that
28:53 two planes went like this zoom like this
28:57 right in front of my eyes and for those
28:58 of you who run podcasts they flew in a
29:02 little side by side in opposite
29:04 directions vertically to my eyesight in
29:06 my mind's eye against the ceiling and so
29:09 the next thing I said was
29:11 and I think it's gonna have to do with
29:12 planes and she said in the bed yeah me
29:17 too
29:18 now I'm sure she didn't say that because
29:21 of planes I think she just maybe have
29:23 felt something weird was happening maybe
29:25 I was channeling it all and projecting
29:27 it to her don't know the next day and I
29:31 had rarely ever spent the night at her
29:33 house that was the weird thing she
29:35 always spent them at my place
29:36 the next day she got up to go to work
29:38 and for whatever reason I was really
29:42 busy with what I was doing with my life
29:44 at Electronic Arts but I guess I was
29:47 more of a producer at the time because
29:49 we had a huge reduction in force and I
29:53 came out the director job went to a
29:55 producer job and I'd have to be at work
29:58 I guess super early what I'm trying to
29:59 say but her phone starts ringing off the
30:02 hook the next morning and I'm at her
30:04 house you don't answer someone else's
30:05 telephone but it was weird cuz who would
30:07 call her in the morning and they just
30:08 kept ringing and ringing the ring and
30:09 she's calling me from the cell phone
30:10 telling me something's happened in New
30:12 York I know what's going on and then I
30:14 will obviously turn the television on
30:15 and my mind is blown right but it took
30:19 me a while to remember that I had said
30:21 that that's the other weird thing wasn't
30:23 like the next morning I was like
30:24 remember me telling you last night this
30:26 and the in the planes you have to
30:28 understand the plane vision I still see
30:31 it in my head today the kitchen I still
30:33 see it like it was just yesterday that's
30:36 the other word thing about those moments
30:38 now the other one that I think a lot of
30:40 us have and I which I haven't had this
30:43 since cellphones this is weird but with
30:45 home phones they used to be this thing
30:47 where you would be heavily concentrating
30:51 in a book or doing something because we
30:53 didn't have the Internet
30:54 we're actually learning things and you
30:56 would look at the phone and go the
30:58 phone's gonna ring and it would ring and
31:00 you predict it this happen all the time
31:02 I think you didn't hear the first ring
31:06 because you were so embedded in what you
31:08 were doing but your brain heard it and
31:10 says the phone's ringing and so you look
31:12 at the phone you don't consciously
31:13 remember the first ring but you predict
31:15 the second ring anyway thought I'd throw
31:17 that out there just to kind of full
31:19 disclose you know
31:21 so I have sympathy for people that
31:24 perhaps in their lifetime they've had
31:28 these experiences that are very legit
31:31 but unlike my experiences which were got
31:35 20 years apart from each other their
31:38 experiences are much more common and so
31:41 they they do not sure it they you know
31:44 what if something happened to you a lot
31:45 that was really strange what if you saw
31:47 ghosts all the time
31:48 well you might realize something that's
31:51 indicative of your body of the
31:53 environment that happens prior to seeing
31:55 a ghost
31:55 and so you're like oh it's gonna happen
31:57 right now and then poof there it is
31:58 right but if it only happens to you one
32:01 or two times in your entire lifetime you
32:03 don't have any like precursors that
32:05 you're memorizing because of repetition
32:08 so for us it would be very random you
32:11 know I've had other really strange
32:14 things happen to me in my lifetime as a
32:15 kid especially with telephones and
32:20 I wouldn't call it psychic but damn I
32:23 don't know what the hell it was
32:26 you know I feel like sharing I got a big
32:28 cigar here some of us go ahead and say
32:30 it if you remember this you're a
32:33 hardcore deep thoughts listen and let me
32:35 tell you in fact comment if you remember
32:38 this because I don't remember last time
32:40 I said this story I'm a little kid I
32:42 come home after school like all kids
32:44 three o'clock because I saw long went to
32:46 school in Kansas I make up my bed I had
32:48 a captain's bed and my mom's room is the
32:52 one next door it's a two bedroom
32:53 apartment I hear a telephone because the
32:57 old telephones kids used to have bells
32:59 in them and it was a little knocker arm
33:01 hit the Bell she had one of those red
33:04 she had a red phone that looks like
33:06 those red phones that you would have the
33:08 president have on his desk and one of
33:12 those old 5060 70s movies it looked just
33:14 like that it always thought weird cuz it
33:17 was red just kind of bloody red who the
33:20 hell buys a red phone they show like a
33:22 red apartment which we didn't we had
33:23 always had country and wood and
33:24 everything but I'm making in my bed and
33:27 I hear the phone go ping in the other
33:29 room
33:29 and so I go to the other room and my
33:32 mom's bed was like a queen-size bed up
33:34 again
33:34 a headboard with the shelfs in it you
33:37 know he put books in it and stuff
33:38 couple sliding doors on both sides she
33:40 always kept the phone on top of a book
33:43 just just right over her head right and
33:46 so it's on the mattress and it's kind of
33:50 off the hook and so I'm kind of going
33:52 that's weird like I don't know where the
33:55 phone was before I entered the room
34:00 because I never go in my mom's room so
34:01 maybe she I thought maybe she put in
34:03 some cockeyed weird position and then it
34:05 just finally just gave up and rolled
34:06 over and that's why it's there no big
34:08 deal so I put the phone back on the hook
34:11 and you know push it deep inside the
34:13 thing
34:14 and I go off and continue working in my
34:17 room I'm or in a couple seconds later I
34:20 heard a BAM same Bell inside the thing
34:25 because if you hit the thing on the
34:26 ground you'd the Bell a little hammer
34:28 with the Bell and you get a little chime
34:29 right so this time and it only had a
34:32 six-foot wire so it was really
34:34 cumbersome because it's eating like
34:36 three feet just to get to the headboard
34:39 and then there's like three feet that
34:40 you can't get out have a little quick
34:41 conversation right I always thought it
34:43 was so cool to have a telephone in your
34:45 room back in the day but now I go and I
34:48 look and there's about two feet between
34:50 the bed on the left side and the wall
34:52 and the [ __ ] thing is on the ground
34:55 with the receiver pulled out as far as
34:58 it could go and now I'm getting freaked
35:01 out now I'm like oh okay if there's a
35:04 burglar in here be pretty impossible
35:07 because the closet doesn't have any
35:09 space there's no space under the bed and
35:11 why wouldn't they just kill me right
35:13 it's broad daylight man and so I'm like
35:16 I put this it's a red phone you know
35:19 it's like that hole is in a satanic
35:20 color scheme or whatever so I put the
35:22 thing back on I push it back in and now
35:24 I'm out of there my room's clean anyway
35:26 so I leave close the door didn't lock it
35:31 I just run over to my buddy Jeff and
35:35 Jim's house because I don't think I had
35:37 their phone number what just wasn't like
35:39 that in the 70s I'm like okay I got
35:41 something weird going on at my house
35:43 what's going on
35:44 well this telephone thing boom BAM two
35:45 things and they're like really weird
35:47 and so we're all coming back over the
35:50 house and Jeff in this particular case
35:53 was the older case by a couple years
35:54 older me out no no maybe was 13 pretty
35:57 tall kid we're all running up the stairs
36:00 to the apartment he's able to go in
36:02 because the door is unlocked because
36:04 that's what was in the 70s and he no
36:08 sooner goes in then he comes running out
36:11 the door and he's got his hand over his
36:14 face this is a kid who beat me up the
36:16 first day I met him because I gave him a
36:17 bunch of [ __ ] it was pretty funny it's
36:19 how we became best friends he put me in
36:21 a full nelson i just couldnt get out but
36:24 uh he's white the kids white I can still
36:27 see his face to this day and I'm like
36:29 whoa whoa what's going on he goes the
36:31 phone and your kitchen is on the ground
36:33 and it's got the you know that sound cuz
36:37 that's what they used to do to let you
36:39 know your phone was out the hook so I go
36:41 in there and it's one of the nice you
36:43 know banana kind they go on the wall
36:44 with the nice round push buttons instead
36:46 of the rotary thing and we're all
36:50 freaked out so I put the thing back on
36:52 the phone left and we hung out of his
36:55 place until my mom came home never
36:57 happened again how weird is that right
37:01 there nothing stolen from the house
37:03 there's plenty of jewelry everywhere so
37:05 if there was a thief they would have
37:06 stolen everything they would have
37:07 molested me or whatever right so I think
37:11 there's some weird stuff in the world
37:14 now let's get back to our psychics let's
37:18 talk about the psychic that can touch
37:19 something and recreate its journey the
37:24 interesting thing about that is because
37:27 there's two types of things that the
37:29 police officers do on a regular basis
37:31 okay and there it sits for a regular
37:33 basis because I think it works at some
37:35 level that's handy and you know a lot of
37:38 these folks get accused of reading
37:39 newspapers and just deducing okay
37:41 whatever if you're helping to solve a
37:43 crime I don't care if you put underwear
37:45 on your head and a bra and around your
37:47 face do it because it'll help us close
37:49 cases hopefully but there's two two
37:53 formats to this they'll give a psychic
37:56 an article of clothing or possession of
37:59 a victim that is
38:01 sadly in some cases dead so that's one
38:05 archetype we have to keep that in our
38:06 brain then you have a weapon a knife a
38:11 pistol that is get or even a cigarette
38:15 but from someone who was smoking
38:16 cigarettes and waiting for someone to
38:18 capture them and that's someone who's
38:21 alive now sometimes they've guided cops
38:24 right to the bodies and then you're kind
38:27 of like oh god is this person involved
38:28 with the church is st. and just knows
38:29 what the bodies are buried the other one
38:32 is is that they'll illustrate a person's
38:34 face to give you a description of what
38:37 the killer might be looking like and a
38:38 lot of times it's accurate so weird men
38:42 so what happens in our ether old soul
38:45 world that might explain that because
38:48 that's the interesting thing what would
38:51 have to happen scientifically with our
38:55 science not just the capitalist religion
38:57 science but what would have to happen
38:59 for that to work so let's go with
39:03 someone who's passed they touching some
39:05 article of clothing on their half well
39:07 one scenario it could actually be very
39:09 simple the spirit that was killed sticks
39:13 around and they work on both sides of
39:17 this equation
39:18 the killer stuff or their stuff they may
39:22 actually show up for work on the day
39:27 that the psychic person who actually has
39:29 an you know every once in a while some
39:31 real legitimate psychic capabilities and
39:33 they simply go okay this person is open
39:36 to communication with the other side and
39:39 so I'm going to use that mechanism to
39:43 talk to him I'm gonna show him where my
39:45 body is I'm going to make justice happen
39:48 on earth let's hope justice exists on
39:51 the other side so it'd be just as simple
39:54 as when you hold someone else's stuff
39:58 it's a very interesting thing isn't it
40:02 it's weird if you go to a department
40:04 store and you hold a piece of cloth from
40:08 an outfit that you want a jacket you
40:10 might want some jewelry if anything
40:13 you're seeing the factory it was created
40:14 in because
40:15 there's no passion and soul in this
40:17 object in most cases because it was
40:20 manufactured for somewhere else to own
40:22 it for someone else to fall in love with
40:23 it for someone else to use it as a
40:25 utility or whatever but once you're
40:27 given something that has been around for
40:29 a while and it's been a blouse it's been
40:31 a scarf it's been some you know bracelet
40:36 or something well they loved that thing
40:39 they made a choice to buy it they put it
40:42 on their body the body is a symbiotic
40:45 creature of soul body and mind and so
40:49 that objects being made of the same
40:51 general energy type that the soul has to
40:56 borrow to exists there may be an echo a
41:01 straight-up echo of its original owner
41:04 but even without being psychic you know
41:06 how many of you have like been over a
41:09 friend's house or your grandparents
41:10 house and they they give you something
41:13 from your grandmother grandfather
41:14 great-grandmother great-grandfather and
41:16 you could hold it and you're like oh my
41:18 god I'm holding something that my
41:21 relative you know a hundred years ago
41:23 held it's a special thing and you sort
41:26 of have this psychic moment with it it's
41:28 not like you're predicting anything or
41:30 seeing the past necessarily you're just
41:32 having this amazing connection with this
41:35 object and it could be simply that that
41:37 they follow their objects for a while
41:39 just to see where they go
41:40 you know I got all kinds of things in my
41:42 house of really no value but it'd be
41:45 interesting to see where they perish at
41:47 some point as I go to the other side I
41:48 wanted like where's my Les Paul gonna go
41:50 who's gonna use it it's gonna go in good
41:52 hands it's gonna get ground up somewhere
41:54 is it gonna get you know in a flood and
41:56 explode huh maybe I'll sit around and
42:00 watch it and if my grandson or whatever
42:03 picks it up I'll be there built like
42:07 here's how you do a lick bother you know
42:09 boom move your hand a little bit there
42:10 you know pluck it this way who knows
42:15 very basic example but it could be just
42:18 as simple as that and I'll be honest
42:21 that's what I think happens I know
42:23 that's sort of like a back door to the
42:26 theory but that's how simple I think it
42:27 could be
42:29 now if it weren't that then it would be
42:33 sort of like The Shining best written by
42:37 Stephen King best directed by Stanley
42:39 Kubrick were Scatman Crothers just
42:44 talking to the kid explaining the
42:46 Overlook Hotel I know we recently
42:48 mentioned this but we're on topic here
42:49 and he said that there's just echoes of
42:53 the past you know if I got into a pool
42:58 and I walked around and I got out of the
43:00 pool well you know the pool was made of
43:01 pretty chaotic water and so it's gonna
43:04 reconstitute back to what it was no
43:06 evidence I was over there unless I pee
43:09 in the water but if I were to get into
43:12 say someone who's built a beautiful
43:15 sandcastle and I'm a or they say okay
43:19 now it's time for it to go down go
43:20 they're destroyed we won't do the other
43:22 side of the game and I go up and I
43:24 destroy it and mess with it and he's
43:26 like good good great well if I walk away
43:28 and someone sees my work let's there
43:31 it's stationary it's for the most part
43:33 and you can see what I did
43:35 so now expand your thinking and
43:39 potentially there's you know in this
43:43 channel we acknowledge two forms of
43:47 energy equal energy which is really a
43:50 non charged particle that certain
43:52 behaviors is classified as either
43:54 positive or negative but it's all just
43:55 dust floating around this box that we're
43:59 in alright so is a residual ether around
44:03 a particular object hmm I would tend to
44:07 think not because I think is
44:09 ever-renewing but perhaps some of the
44:11 currents from its owner are still sort
44:14 of hovering around the object it has an
44:17 influence and through familiarity with
44:22 currents a psychic might be able to
44:24 literally reverse-engineer the feeling
44:26 to a brunette
44:28 to a blonde to big-nose to a pointy nose
44:31 to a cleft chin whatever it's a bit of a
44:35 stretch for me but the other one the
44:39 other energy source that we call energy
44:41 for the lack of a better
44:43 classification would be your soul energy
44:45 a little bit of your identity on that
44:49 tree branch of all life okay well we
44:54 just talked about the in the bilingual
45:00 aphasia episode the notion that the
45:02 fractal which is the same fractal that
45:06 happens in the arteries in your lung and
45:08 the branches in a tree it seems to be
45:12 that you know regardless of where the
45:14 fractal ends it really doesn't end it
45:16 really just gets so microscopic that you
45:18 can't see it look at a Mandelbrot set or
45:20 a julian set or whatever and you'll see
45:22 it as it is below so - it is above all
45:27 right so what if what did this
45:31 microphone right here of which I've
45:33 recorded I have two of these two stands
45:37 they look very similar ones in my office
45:39 for now and ones right here as the
45:41 stands start to die you guys take this
45:43 broken one inside but it'll probably at
45:45 least 250 shows on this mic okay so
45:50 maybe if you own this mic there's a
45:54 little bit of me on there forever
45:55 my branch the biggest thickest branch is
46:00 right here it's my soul it's Who I am
46:02 in this particular body at this moment
46:04 in time once my body ceases to function
46:06 the branch will simply find another soul
46:09 I mean it sorry another embryo detached
46:11 - and then boom I'm reborn maybe it goes
46:13 off into some other wild dimension but
46:16 what if just like a normal branch you
46:19 see a branch on a tree and that's the
46:21 one you used to tie the let's tie the
46:23 old tire to and swing on right it's one
46:26 used to climb up there and relax and
46:27 read a book well you know if you broke a
46:30 branch off in 1980 but you come back ten
46:36 years later more branches have grown out
46:38 of the big branch what if soul energy
46:43 attaches to things I am spending a fair
46:46 amount of my life by this microphone
46:48 every episodes an hour and a half to two
46:50 hours even though might be only an hour
46:52 for you
46:53 well it's thousands of hours on this mic
46:56 at least hundreds and so maybe even if I
47:00 don't have any soul energy in that mic
47:03 personally I'm not feeling like the mic
47:05 is talking to him you're holding a
47:06 little bit of my memory in there maybe
47:08 it is but it's got a little piece of me
47:10 on there and a psychic really touches it
47:13 and they just feel the branch up to the
47:17 soul that you used to use this mic and
47:20 so you are feeling and seeing in your
47:23 brain because you can rasterize the
47:25 connection a physical body the guy was
47:30 six feet tall he was skinny and he had a
47:33 bum eye and a scar on his face whatever
47:36 you're doing a database lookup on the
47:39 connection it's like tracing a packet on
47:41 the internet or this Internet packet
47:43 come from well let me check três três
47:46 três três três of egypt okay
47:50 maybe that's the way that particular one
47:53 works by the way if you haven't seen the
47:57 movie dead zone by well and I can't
48:00 remember who directed it with
48:01 Christopher Walken based on the book by
48:03 Stephen King it is it is an amazing
48:07 movie I mean Christopher Walken kills
48:09 this role I mean just blows it away it's
48:12 amazing let's definitely go and see it
48:13 if you can't it's probably free
48:16 definitely worth a rental 399 for damn
48:18 sure but now let's go over to John
48:21 Edwards I was still watching TV when
48:26 John Edwards got famous on TV and I
48:28 can't remember what channel it was I
48:30 felt like it was vh1 or something like
48:31 that maybe was sci-fi or something like
48:34 that but he had this show for those of
48:38 you who've never seen the guy he's just
48:39 so average dude and he has a town hall
48:43 format where he's got a circular balcony
48:47 or sorry um Stadium seating and he sits
48:52 in the middle and people sit there and
48:54 watch now the truth of the matter is he
48:57 filmed for about 12 to 13 hours a day
48:59 one of my friends went to the show
49:04 and he will just start listening and
49:09 then he starts saying things now the law
49:12 of averages are really high that no
49:14 matter what he says someone in the rooms
49:16 gonna have some intimate experience with
49:18 whatever he says but he takes it further
49:21 and further and further to a point where
49:23 when I think the guys on he is for my
49:27 money if I were if someone were to say
49:30 okay we know everyone who's psychic in
49:33 the world for real and those that aren't
49:34 you got a gun to your head name a person
49:37 that you think is actually psychic I
49:39 would say John Edwards to be honest and
49:43 there was a few there was two that I
49:45 remember out of dozens of shows that I
49:48 watched and and just so you know my
49:49 friend who went to the show said that he
49:52 fails a lot and he sets everybody up to
49:55 say look I'm it's not always on so I'm
49:57 doing my best
49:58 we're gonna harvest the ones that
50:00 connect but if your relatives because he
50:02 talks to dead people he said if your
50:05 relatives come at me super strong and I
50:08 have a really strong message for you but
50:11 it almost seemed like it was it was a
50:13 skill that you had to develop on the
50:14 other side as well I don't know
50:18 take take his word for it why not there
50:21 were two that I thought were just
50:24 profound and because they were very
50:26 specific
50:27 from the very beginning at least the way
50:29 it was edited and one of them had a post
50:32 interview with this gangster from New
50:34 York that utterly blew me away but one
50:40 of them was he started mentioning a
50:44 woman that died in her house and he was
50:48 very specific about how this all went
50:50 down and no one's saying anything
50:55 no one's going yeah that's mine cuz it's
50:59 too generic right
51:00 but this kid he starts saying he goes
51:03 one of you because I feel like it's
51:05 right over here
51:05 and he goes one of you found the body
51:10 and it's not what they wanted to have
51:13 happen and they know that it was very
51:15 very traumatic for you and then you know
51:17 part of this is just mathematics right
51:18 of course anyone who finds a dead body
51:20 of a loved one is going to be
51:23 dramatically affected unless something
51:25 really bad isn't going on in the family
51:28 but the kid this little this young kid
51:31 teenage kid starts just silently sobbing
51:35 and then he's like is it you and the
51:42 kids like not even wanting to say it was
51:45 him and then he went on and mentioned
51:49 like several details about the situation
51:52 about where the body was how they found
51:55 them what they did next and your minds
51:57 just blowing right and his kid just
52:00 unloads for the it's almost like the kid
52:02 had never cried it all the way out like
52:04 nobody nobody knew that this had
52:07 happened I think that was part of the
52:08 fact process and he had held it in and
52:11 he's really young you know I mean when
52:13 you're young you really have your right
52:15 brain your emotions
52:16 usually if you're not vaccinated to
52:18 death you're alive man when you get
52:21 older you get harder and you shut off
52:23 your brain and all that kind of stuff so
52:24 this kid was really alive you know but
52:27 that one really touched me I thought you
52:29 know man he was just going off rat on
52:31 off all kinds of details but the second
52:35 one was which was even more powerful was
52:40 that he started getting this this story
52:45 in his mind and he said I'm getting he
52:50 mentioned the boy's name it was a boy
52:52 who died very young and he started
52:56 talking about the fact that the funeral
52:58 was a big deal in the neighborhood and
53:01 that everybody came and this woman
53:06 starts to kind of sob and she's like she
53:12 doesn't want to say like it's almost
53:13 like they it's a private matter even
53:15 though they're there to hear this kind
53:16 of stuff when it finally hits their
53:18 ticket it's like they're kind of like
53:20 you know I don't want my personal
53:22 information out there but I guess I'm
53:23 here to hear this and if they're really
53:25 breaking through to talk to me
53:27 and I gotta acknowledge it but the woman
53:31 starts to acknowledge this such this
53:33 particular story and then John proceeds
53:36 to talk about the people that had
53:37 already passed to the other side that
53:39 picked up the kid as soon as he went to
53:42 the other side and I believe he was one
53:44 for one perfect with his predictions
53:47 meaning a father or someone that was
53:49 already on this side because the people
53:50 sitting in the bleachers were the
53:53 grandparents and the mother the
53:56 grandmother was looking at her husband
53:58 who's got kind of like shaded glasses on
54:00 and I think he was chewing on something
54:03 some candy and you could see he was
54:06 fighting his emotions
54:08 because he's he's the old-fashioned man
54:10 you don't show your emotions right so
54:13 they then interview this guy afterwards
54:15 and it was probably the only post
54:18 interview that I can remember but this
54:22 dude is like in a chair by himself
54:25 he's chewing on the candy or whatever it
54:27 was just kind of annoying but that was
54:29 his defense mechanism to kind of
54:31 distract himself from being super
54:32 emotional and he's like you're you're
54:35 Italian guy a little gold necklace with
54:39 a little amulet from the Catholic Church
54:41 on there and he as hard as a rock man I
54:45 mean this dude you could just see him
54:47 working for John Gotti man but he's like
54:51 they're like well what did you think
54:53 about you know John's reading and the
54:56 dude sitting there and you can tell he
54:58 is like on the cusp of releasing tears
55:01 in fact I kind of think he did but I
55:04 don't think it rolled down his face but
55:05 you couldn't see his eyes because of the
55:06 glasses but his he started getting super
55:09 choked up which I'm sure for that guy is
55:11 a pretty rare emotion but his words that
55:15 the only words I can really remember him
55:17 saying was he starts nodding like this
55:20 just for those of you Nadia just a
55:22 slight nod and he goes John's for real
55:27 he goes I'm a believer now and he goes
55:30 you have to understand I fought my wife
55:32 tooth and nail not to come to this
55:34 stupid thing because I'm a believer the
55:39 dudes for real
55:40 and that always stuck with me and
55:42 because John never at least in my
55:48 experience ever seen the guy interviewed
55:51 he's been interviewed with other
55:53 psychics that were busted he in and
55:57 everything I've ever seen was never
55:59 arrogant about his capabilities never
56:03 flip it very honest about it not working
56:07 all the time I thought man either that's
56:11 a gimmick or to be you know seem more
56:15 legit to us or he's for real and that's
56:20 sort of what I thought about that guy
56:21 and he was the one that I really because
56:23 he said publicly look it doesn't always
56:26 work and they don't come in with visions
56:29 that I understand because sometimes
56:31 they'll talk in metaphors for me and I'm
56:32 trying to translate them to you to have
56:35 someone sorted out for me I thought that
56:38 was pretty legit you know I won't even
56:41 bore everybody with the old story but
56:43 you know go look up my episode on ghosts
56:45 and demons and you'll get the story
56:47 again I've said it several times but I
56:50 remember the other episodes probably
56:52 afterlife has it as well reincarnation
56:53 definitely has the story as well but you
56:56 know I've had a personal experience Walt
56:58 Disney that it's legit you know never
57:03 worried about the afterlife it's there
57:06 and for what I can tell it's it's on
57:10 your terms you are not I mean I guess if
57:16 you're a good person you don't have any
57:18 penance you have to pay or something
57:20 like that you're there now the only
57:22 other thing that I could think someone
57:24 could insinuate would be what if your
57:28 punishment for being a bad person is you
57:31 can't leave until you work something out
57:33 and so that's a potential outcome you
57:40 know maybe I met Walton at Walt Disney
57:41 because he did something bad you know I
57:44 do want to put like a little footnote I
57:46 am probably gonna do an episode on Walt
57:48 Disney 100% dedicated
57:51 it is and this is kind of off topic here
57:55 but you know the Disney franchise is
57:59 obviously not what Walt Disney created
58:03 and I think we have to extend that to
58:08 him because he's long gone if any of the
58:13 Mouseketeers any issues with him as
58:15 insinuated by just kind of broad stroke
58:18 oh this place is wicked and dead it uh
58:20 okay well there's plenty of time for
58:24 people to come out and say something I
58:26 haven't heard anything the guy was so
58:29 involved in his work he lived at the
58:32 park literally after 1955 to 1965 when
58:36 he died he he lived above the fire
58:40 station he was building a new apartment
58:42 over the Pirates of the Caribbean to
58:44 move his family into so they could spend
58:46 time with him as well but he died before
58:48 that you know New Orleans area was
58:52 opened some didn't go anywhere but I'll
58:55 tell you you know people who knew him
58:57 who I've talked to they were like this
59:00 guy was so legit is so wonderful and
59:03 just wanted the world to be a wonderful
59:04 beautiful place that's why he created
59:06 Tomorrowland to inspire us to go to the
59:09 next level always trying to make
59:11 happiness I mean all of his scripts were
59:14 the Grimm's brother stories from the I
59:17 guess their 1800 stories but they all
59:19 ended badly and the German tales were to
59:22 get kids to behave by telling you that
59:25 if you wanted out in the woods you get
59:26 eaten by a wolf if you met a woman who
59:30 lived in a shoe didn't kill you I mean
59:32 it was always death death death and I
59:35 didn't learn that until American McGee
59:39 did his series on the grimm brothers
59:41 which was a very clever video game but
59:43 the engine the Unreal Engine wasn't up
59:46 to snuff for what he was doing but he
59:49 was the one that taught me that these
59:50 are actually really negative stories and
59:52 I was learning all over cheese so Walt
59:53 took all those stories and spun them in
59:55 a positive way and made billions okay
59:59 but let me just finish up that little
60:02 scenario I'll jump off and massively
60:04 detailed episode about the guy at a
60:07 different time but what if you were
60:09 responsible for creating a place where
60:11 little kids went and families went and
60:14 little kids worshipped the product line
60:16 and all that kind of stuff and then you
60:19 die
60:20 maybe someone kills you nobody thought
60:24 that Walt was in any life-threatening
60:26 situation he was he went to the hospital
60:28 to get his throat looked at and he died
60:30 and everybody was shocked someone would
60:35 take over your company who has bad
60:38 intentions for those little kids and
60:41 then what happened is the company's
60:42 named after you literally and then it
60:48 all maps to you well that's not fair all
60:52 right so before you jump off on that now
60:54 what it is today I think we've got some
60:57 pretty bad pretty bad situations here
61:00 and there a lot of pedophiles that have
61:01 been caught this year and last year all
61:03 Disney employees you know former
61:05 executives even it's bad news but where
61:08 would you go you go become a preacher
61:10 you would go become a Boy Scout Cub
61:14 Scout leader because plenty of
61:15 pedophiles in those groups we're gonna
61:17 blame the whole organization for that
61:19 one thing and in some cases we do in
61:23 some cases we don't now let's talk about
61:25 psychics that predict the future because
61:29 that's very interesting now I promise I
61:32 talked about cold reading and warm
61:34 reading some of you know way more about
61:36 this than I do so I'm not trying to put
61:39 myself out as an authority but I've
61:41 definitely spent a good 25 years
61:43 thinking about it after I was taught how
61:44 it works least the basics of it all now
61:48 the cold reading is defined as persons
61:50 in front of you and they're giving you
61:52 as little as information as possible but
61:56 psychologists and magicians that use
61:58 psychology will tell you there they are
62:01 giving up something even though they
62:02 think they're not I just met a great
62:05 magician
62:05 Brett Allen he's here in Huntington
62:08 Beach and we smoked a cigar together and
62:11 he did a few tricks for me and he did to
62:13 psychology tricks for me and he gave me
62:16 a
62:18 a white clay ball and a black clay ball
62:21 he said here's the thing I'm looking for
62:24 the black one so I'm gonna turn around
62:26 and I want you to just to mix these
62:28 things up in your palms figure out which
62:30 one you have it in and then I'm gonna
62:32 turn around I'm gonna look at you and
62:33 I'm gonna ask you to say that the black
62:38 ball is in neither hand no matter what I
62:39 ask you just say no and I said no both
62:43 times but he's looking me right in the
62:45 face and he's like it's right there he
62:49 was right okay maybe it's a fluke let's
62:51 do it one more time mix it up again
62:53 we'll do the no thing no no he got it
62:57 right because I don't tell lies when I
63:00 tell lies there must be some little
63:03 thing in my face but then he made it
63:05 even easier but this was hilarious he
63:09 said say yes now and for whatever
63:13 reasons saying yes made my read ten
63:18 times better and I forgot how I shook my
63:23 head or whatever it was but I hesitated
63:25 just a tad because I had to tell a lie
63:27 now how do I do that
63:29 why do that right and he goes you saw it
63:33 you did that right and I go yeah Christ
63:35 that's so awesome there he's like yeah
63:36 that's what people I can do this all day
63:38 long and I'm always right because most
63:40 people aren't con men and they they
63:42 don't have a good poker face boom but a
63:45 cold reading will go something like this
63:48 they usually will have to tell you sort
63:52 of what they're looking for because then
63:54 you're like well am I trying to help you
63:55 with your relationship am I trying to
63:57 help you with your finances what is it
63:59 you know you're just unhappy and you
64:00 don't like they usually get some
64:01 objective from the person and the one
64:05 woman that got busted on television she
64:11 was actually in a she was actually on it
64:14 was one of these three-way call things
64:16 maybe Larry King or something she was in
64:19 one remote location the guest the other
64:22 guest was in a different location and
64:23 the host was in whatever the studio and
64:27 she looked at the other guy and she goes
64:30 well I can see you probably
64:32 she said I can see you're having
64:32 prostate issues and he's like yeah
64:36 you're just saying that cuz I'm old
64:38 she was we better get it checked out you
64:40 know she has all the responses well he
64:43 doesn't you know unless he got a
64:44 colonoscopy literally or not even that
64:47 just to Bill checkup you know check your
64:49 oil thing in like the day before he
64:53 would not know and so she can put doubt
64:55 in his mind and then she seems legit
64:57 luckily the prostates of my family work
65:00 really well so cold reading will go off
65:03 of a lot of just physical indicators
65:06 from the person either in in like
65:09 subdermal reactions or it will simply be
65:12 you know they look like they're sixteen
65:14 probably in the middle of that kind of
65:16 relationship thing probably being dumb
65:18 in this particular way and so you just
65:21 make predictions and you're waiting for
65:22 the response from their face or their
65:26 body language and then you know you got
65:29 a hit or a miss and you just keep diving
65:30 in on all the hits it seems like magic
65:34 but it's just straight-up psychology and
65:37 again it has value if the session you're
65:43 having with the person is either
65:44 entertaining or it's it's just logic
65:50 there's there's value in both systems
65:52 right what's a placebo medicine it's a
65:54 medicine you think works you take it
65:55 your mind develops neuropeptides and and
65:59 advanced immune system with biofeedback
66:01 sort of thing and you fix it yourself
66:05 it's like the kid who got in the hot
66:07 springs in South America to fix his
66:10 cancer in the book the holographic
66:13 universe and you can see his his pelvic
66:15 x-ray he lost at least a quarter of his
66:18 pelvis where his hip bone was he lost
66:20 the top third of his femur bone
66:23 something like that 25% is something
66:25 like that he lost his whole ball joint
66:27 the cartilage everything but the kid
66:29 went to this Hot Springs I for several
66:33 months I want to say like 16 months or
66:36 something was it was a long time he grew
66:38 the whole thing back can you imagine
66:40 that going back your hip growing back
66:43 your pelvis joint top of your femur
66:46 plus the cartilage cap on the end to
66:49 make it nice and lubricated right smooth
66:51 boom we can't fix ourselves 100% God has
66:56 given us everything that we need it's
66:58 cynicism it's trying to be hard all
67:02 these things that just make us divorce
67:04 ourselves from the balance of nature
67:06 that was placed in us by the Almighty
67:09 and you can call it the universe
67:11 whatever you want to call it same thing
67:13 now warm reading is exciting for a
67:17 psychic I would say a conman psychic
67:21 because they're getting all kinds of
67:23 information off of you you can come
67:25 inside to a psychic and go okay well I'm
67:27 in this new relationship the guy seems a
67:29 little fishy here and there but I love
67:31 him to death but he does these things
67:32 that are so sweet and I think that he
67:35 might be a good guy I just don't know
67:36 what do you think boom the psyches gonna
67:39 start their script and it's a script
67:43 that helps them evaluate a human being
67:45 it would be the same kind of
67:47 conversation you have with a really good
67:49 parent who's had a good experience in
67:51 relationships and would just talk you
67:54 through it
67:55 except they will talk in sort of a
67:57 backhanded way that seems psychic still
68:01 has value it's just a game so no
68:05 criticism Oh Maya now let's talk about I
68:09 don't know if this is considered psychic
68:11 I think it is let's talk about a seance
68:16 what's this typical anatomy of a seance
68:19 well you bring several people together
68:22 which I don't quite understand the
68:24 several people thing and you can hold
68:26 hands and there could be a crystal ball
68:28 and there could be all kinds of things
68:29 doesn't have to you can have the session
68:33 with one person there and the psychic
68:37 but they then do something called
68:40 channeling and channeling I have seen so
68:44 many hoaxes of this it's talked about
68:47 entertaining a person trying to fake
68:49 channeling an alien boy if you just want
68:54 to see some funny stuff just go up to
68:55 YouTube and type in man
68:59 alien and there's some hilarious thing
69:03 one of them is a guy he started talking
69:06 like this he started because he grew up
69:08 in the 50s and so he started talking
69:11 like aliens were portrayed on TV to him
69:14 that's legit man aliens always talk like
69:17 this and monotone voices and people
69:19 talking weird you know tongue languages
69:21 and that kind of stuff you know the
69:23 whole thing about speaking in tongues
69:25 it's like wow if Christianity was
69:29 correct and you had you know you're
69:31 Jesus and you're Satan talking in
69:35 tongues boy if there wasn't a Linda
69:39 Blair Exorcist moment it would be
69:43 talking in tongues why would the
69:46 Almighty God make you speak in some
69:49 gibberish foreign language to behold God
69:54 to get information from God yeah let's
69:57 let's send down a bunch of gibberish
69:59 that no one in the room is gonna
70:00 understand because I really want to be
70:02 heard right
70:03 the whole theory of it is just insane
70:05 now maybe tonguing talking in tongues is
70:10 more of a just some weird pent-up energy
70:13 that is just like actors you know an
70:17 actor is supposed to speak all the
70:20 syllables right you know the the little
70:23 exercises before you go and speak clear
70:26 lines you would speak something like red
70:28 leather yellow leather red leather
70:29 yellow leather that kind of stuff right
70:31 get your tongue
70:33 totally untied by going through tongue
70:36 twisters and it might be just that the
70:39 human mind just has a bunch of fodder in
70:41 it and it just comes out in this blah
70:43 you know thing and then they feel better
70:47 they're exercising demons or something
70:49 now I haven't heard anyone say the
70:51 tonguing is demoness tickly purging
70:54 something that might make a lot more
70:55 sense to me if all this other stuff was
70:58 correct which I don't necessarily
71:00 believe but what if there's some you
71:02 know life force here on earth we don't
71:03 see therefore it doesn't exist and then
71:06 it actually does exist and then it just
71:09 pushes through and you loosen your brain
71:11 up to take on some other
71:12 consciousness and there goes but you
71:15 know but now could someone puppet
71:19 someone else as a possession mm-hmm
71:23 well yours truly as a word story for you
71:25 and let me know if you've heard this one
71:28 before because I have told it it's a
71:31 weird one for me and again for me it's
71:34 just it's it's almost like I feel like a
71:38 kid in a candy store when something like
71:40 this happens to me because I have no
71:44 moment in my life where I'm like oh I
71:46 bet this is gonna happen or I just read
71:47 this book on this and then it's gonna
71:49 happen to me you know my alien
71:51 experience was like that I was reading a
71:52 book to my girlfriend woke up and an
71:54 alien told me what was in my present I
71:56 went back to bed and I was certain it
71:58 was one thing and it was another thing
72:00 and I woke up the next day grabbed and I
72:02 was like oh my god it's not a record
72:03 it's origami paper and I've never seen
72:05 origami paper in my life didn't know it
72:06 was square I always thought I would be
72:08 like 8 by 11 or something and it was
72:10 right it was really weird
72:13 but I'm in this house is 2013 summer and
72:18 I was crunching some code on a personal
72:22 project of mine so I was sleeping in
72:24 there
72:24 not to wake up the girlfriend and I I
72:28 got up and I remember having no sense of
72:35 pain in my body which we kind of
72:38 convinced ourselves we don't have any
72:39 pain in our body and you know when you
72:42 hit your 40s and you start getting likes
72:44 and pains here you said too much in a
72:45 chair you're not out walking around like
72:47 a kid keeping your body healthy because
72:49 were supposed to be moving not sitting
72:50 down like I'm doing right now but I get
72:53 up and I just feel this weird piece I
72:57 mean it was the most tranquil feeling no
73:01 threat no alarm of any kind but I didn't
73:03 realize what was going on until it got
73:06 up I'm buck naked
73:08 I turned the door and I'm walking down
73:10 the hallway and all of a sudden it
73:14 dawned on me there's another
73:16 consciousness in my head having a supper
73:18 conversation and as I'm walking down the
73:22 hallway I hear it say
73:26 in almost like a reflection of of like
73:31 aw it said isn't it funny how they build
73:35 homes so they can feel safe on this ball
73:39 and yes it was a ball and immediately in
73:43 my brain there's a toy version of my
73:46 house I'm not saying it was accurate but
73:48 it was a toy thing toy house on this
73:51 really small earth ball and in terms of
73:55 degrees on a 360 I would say is about a
73:58 mm maybe a 20 degree angle of the house
74:03 on the ball right and so that I'm then
74:06 when I heard that I was like almost like
74:08 who's there you know I'm like whoa but I
74:11 didn't want to disturb it like
74:13 immediately I was like whoa there's
74:14 something here and maybe this is the
74:16 reason why I'm not feeling any pain I
74:18 could feel my feet on the hardwood
74:20 floors but it was weird it was it was
74:24 just the most wonderful feeling so then
74:27 I'm like okay let's not disturb this
74:31 thing and lose it because this is a
74:33 really cool experience right but it it
74:36 said it said the phrase isn't it funny
74:39 how they build houses to keep themselves
74:42 safe and so my first question to it
74:45 because I but it in and I got to the end
74:48 of the hall and I just stood there and
74:50 then in my hallway I have two cupboards
74:52 one has the towels one has all my
74:54 electronics and just junk parts in there
74:56 right and so I'm standing there and like
75:01 oh well where are we then like if this
75:04 is silly to build a house I mean
75:06 obviously we need homes it rains it gets
75:08 cold we need a home and you think this
75:11 is funny means that person being hadn't
75:14 been human for a really long time or
75:16 ever right and so it says it had this
75:22 epiphany moment and I could feel it
75:23 inside me it went oh you're here you can
75:27 hear me like it was that kind of
75:28 epiphany but it was more of like a it
75:31 was almost like a rapid be like someone
75:36 human responding if they were talking to
75:38 them
75:38 selfs in a room and they didn't know you
75:41 were listening and then all of a sudden
75:42 like oh yeah yeah I was just talking to
75:44 myself devil it was like that kind of
75:45 feeling right
75:47 but it says I trying to give exact words
75:51 it said or at least the really accurate
75:53 paraphrase because it said he goes oh no
75:56 no no it's beautiful
75:58 let me show you where we are and then a
76:04 translucent sphere came from outside of
76:08 my body spectrum and shrunk right in
76:11 front of me and it was probably about
76:13 literally the size of a basketball and
76:15 right in front of my face
76:16 of course it's most likely in my mind's
76:18 eye and it goes we're all here and it's
76:24 a wonderful place to be
76:25 and it gave me this amazing feeling of
76:30 you know it's not like heaven but it's
76:33 like the universe it was like we are all
76:35 one and we're all here and this is
76:38 beautiful
76:39 and it wasn't trying to say the the my
76:42 episode about us all being the same
76:45 being because it was definitely distinct
76:47 for me but it was trying to say and I
76:50 got this sense of just euphoria of like
76:53 there is nothing to worry about when it
76:55 comes to death at all I mean it solved
76:59 that equation for me if I hadn't already
77:00 had it solved it's like then you're
77:02 gonna love this when you find out where
77:04 we are and what's going on you're gonna
77:06 dig it so just relax right so my cousin
77:10 Larry that just passed he's there right
77:12 okay so now I gotta I gotta go take a
77:16 shower and I'm kind of like I don't want
77:18 to shake this thing but for whatever
77:21 reason a monopod I should just stood
77:23 there dull it went away so just had a
77:24 big conversation with it but me and my
77:26 disciplined you know life I went around
77:29 the corner and I purposely skip brush on
77:31 my teeth which I usually hate being in
77:33 the shower the you know gross mouth
77:36 because I knew that if I jammed a brush
77:39 on my head or using my electric
77:40 toothbrush or whatever because I use
77:42 both I alternate I just thought it's
77:45 gonna leave and I don't want that so I
77:47 start the water and now I'm what's
77:50 happening is I'm kind of looking at the
77:51 ground a lot
77:52 because I'm like I'm trying not to focus
77:55 on anything because I want it to focus I
77:57 want it to do what it wants to do and
77:58 it's not controlling my body at all and
78:01 so I hop in the shower because it's nice
78:03 and warm and I don't I don't know how to
78:09 explain this next last thing I heard
78:11 which was I lifted up my hands and
78:14 they're being showered with water of
78:16 course and it's warm it's nice and I am
78:19 turning my hands back and forth looking
78:22 at them and it says wow it's been a long
78:26 time since I've been in a body I don't
78:30 know and then I never heard from it
78:31 again never happened to me again but wow
78:34 what a cool experience right now
78:37 channeling has been used to advance
78:41 massive frauds in this world
78:44 the latest gigantic fraud was Planet X
78:48 somebody I can't remember who said it
78:50 they supposedly did this a long time ago
78:52 but they communicate with an alien on
78:54 the planet Nibiru circling the Sun
78:57 nemesis and boy they're gonna come and
79:00 enslave us again to dig gold up again so
79:03 they can squirt it into their atmosphere
79:04 because that's what they need to survive
79:06 because their planet's dying me what a
79:07 joke and a mini solar system that orbits
79:10 into our solar system it doesn't cause
79:13 massive havoc doesn't slam into anything
79:16 and the story was that they were here
79:18 you know thousands of years ago
79:21 incubated man and you know I got a whole
79:25 episode on Planet X if you want to hear
79:26 me just tear this thing a new one but
79:28 the theory no one ever thinks through
79:31 anything right they're like just love a
79:32 conspiracy and just hang on to it for no
79:34 reason whatsoever but the idea is this
79:35 planets come screaming through our solar
79:39 system between Venus and Earth the whole
79:42 solar system fits between Venus and
79:43 Earth and yeah there's a lot of space in
79:45 the space okay all right if you're
79:47 heliocentric but somebody had the
79:51 technology to jump off their planet come
79:53 to our planet in this split second I
79:56 mean what would that be be what a few
79:58 months at the most if it's not going
80:00 that fast jump off gain to our planet
80:02 found I don't know hominid
80:04 did reengineered homeless Appian sapien
80:06 got us all up to snuff to be able to dig
80:09 out gold which is a way advanced thing
80:11 for Muhammad's and then got a bunch of
80:14 gold it's all out of the South Pole and
80:17 then took it up to their planet and then
80:21 they're gone for a little while okay if
80:23 you have that much technology you could
80:25 do fusion and that means they could take
80:28 anything on their planet and turn it
80:29 into gold it's a hell of a lot easier
80:31 than genetically programming a new
80:33 life-form okay no need for this whole
80:35 thing but that was all started by a guy
80:37 who said he channeled now I'm an
80:40 open-minded guy I mean I just told you a
80:41 story about something inside me okay but
80:45 when it hatches these ridiculous
80:47 theories that don't make sense on paper
80:48 using their own storylines then you know
80:52 you got a fraudster on your hands
80:54 someone who's profiting from this whole
80:55 thing we had a lot of 2012 stuff right
80:58 December 2012 the whole world was going
81:00 to end because someone miss reads of
81:02 heavily damaged Aztec calendar right was
81:08 the other one so Atlantis most of the
81:11 evidence for Atlantis and I mean most of
81:13 it is all channeling people well they
81:16 created this story based on some old
81:19 writings from Greece and just elaborated
81:23 and entertained on the if it's
81:25 entertainment I don't care whatever
81:27 Atlanta is not getting people killed or
81:29 people worrying about things but the the
81:31 planet X you know I mean it had people
81:33 worried about a massive meteor strike in
81:36 northern Europe
81:38 I'm gonna hit the northern plains of
81:40 America I mean people were literally
81:42 moving around the world and changing
81:44 their lives because they thought the
81:45 world was gonna end I mean I had phone
81:47 calls to my house where Father Son
81:50 sounded freaked out his dad and you know
81:53 told him it was all gonna happen and I
81:55 said you know I just think it's all
81:56 [ __ ] you know
81:57 and of course nothin happened there you
82:00 go lumeria
82:02 the Pacific version of Atlanta Atlanta
82:05 excuse me not Atlanta of Atlantis is you
82:09 know the other super race that's out
82:11 there in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
82:13 okay so I guess in closing the goat
82:17 would beat
82:18 you use your logic keep an open mind of
82:23 course and try to one decipher a few
82:27 things entertainment which has a value
82:31 you're escaping for a little while
82:33 believing something may whatever
82:35 especially if you know it's
82:37 entertainment you're probably going to
82:38 heavily meter how you respond to the
82:42 fortune cookie right and then there's
82:46 con men that are trying to help you and
82:51 so there's just a psychology session
82:55 with another human being you needed it
82:57 if you went perhaps and it's just say
83:00 they guide you in a logical direction
83:02 that you couldn't discern by yourself
83:04 but if you let them have a warm reading
83:06 especially they're just being a nice
83:08 friend or a parent there is value in
83:12 that too and then you have folks that
83:15 legitimately most likely do have this
83:17 capability on one factor that we've
83:20 mentioned or another and maybe they're
83:23 actually able to hold an article of
83:25 clothing and tell you where the body is
83:26 or tell you the victim or the killer is
83:29 that has value police officers go
83:32 because it works ok let's see the value
83:36 and the other one is like a John Edwards
83:38 who perhaps assists in closure for
83:42 certain people now imagine you go to
83:45 John Edwards session his show and you
83:49 you have dead people everybody has dead
83:52 people in their past and you're just
83:53 kind of sitting there because you want
83:56 to see if they come and talk to you but
83:58 they're looking at you going you don't
84:01 need us you've gotten over us and you're
84:03 healthy and you're fine you're happy we
84:05 don't need to get in there and stir
84:06 things up for you so we're not gonna
84:08 show up but the kid who found his mother
84:13 I believe was his mom dead on the floor
84:15 he hadn't healed yet he had no closure
84:19 and I would say regardless of John was
84:24 lying or telling the truth I happen to
84:26 think he was telling the truth I think
84:28 that mathematically that kid today would
84:31 say you got closure that
84:32 at least some and if he believes it was
84:36 his mom trying to tell him then it
84:40 really probably was closure for the gang
84:43 gangster guy and his wife who lost a
84:46 grandson who he was extremely close to
84:49 he now believes most likely based on his
84:53 own admissions that one John was real
84:55 but two that his son his grandson is
84:58 with the other loved ones that have
85:00 already passed
85:01 hey that's closure to that his value now
85:07 in terms of the ones that have these
85:09 industrial services where you call in
85:12 and talk to folks that are reading off a
85:14 script well it probably falls in the
85:17 other two categories you know it's
85:20 entertainment and it's potentially some
85:23 advice that you just need to hear from a
85:24 stranger you know if you got absolutely
85:29 nothing out of it only you would know
85:30 you know you would know that you had
85:32 been had okay so I'd be really
85:35 interested in your personal experiences
85:37 with this even secondhand experiences
85:41 that you've heard about that seem
85:43 legitimate to you so I would like to
85:45 hear what category that we've covered
85:47 and maybe that I didn't cover that you
85:50 have heard some pretty legitimate claims
85:52 in and give me some some fairly decent
85:55 details about it - what made you feel
85:58 like it was legit if especially if
86:02 you've ever had this done to you
86:04 John's done so many shows I'm willing to
86:07 bet out of 4200 people someone might
86:10 have been on the show we've all seen the
86:14 the fraudsters so but knowing what value
86:19 that would have but you know if you have
86:21 any other epiphanies definitely share
86:22 them with the with the crowd here but I
86:25 want to just bumper with something
86:29 that's just sort of unrelated to the
86:31 subject matter because I want to
86:33 encourage you and maybe you get it from
86:37 the show I'm not sure but I think that
86:41 obviously the show attracts a lot of
86:43 deep thinkers I think it has - otherwise
86:45 you guys would be bored
86:46 stiff but well here's what I get from
86:49 doing the show that I think is extremely
86:51 valuable to me personally which is I
86:57 grow I grow immensely because of my own
87:02 brain churning stuff which has been my
87:04 whole life but I also grow obviously
87:06 because of you and you know it's just
87:09 like having someone sort of it would you
87:13 know when you go to work out out of a
87:14 gym you're intentionally lifting weights
87:16 that tear your muscles so they get
87:18 bigger leaner you burn off some fat and
87:21 you you know get in a better shape okay
87:24 so that's you being very intentional but
87:26 when you have a show like this and your
87:28 your comments it's almost as if someone
87:31 is is carrying your body into the gym
87:34 and then yanking you in different
87:36 directions that tear your muscles and so
87:39 you build up not only because of your
87:41 own direct involvement but because of
87:43 other people's contributions so if you
87:46 don't have a show and you're like I'm
87:47 never making a show I would definitely
87:50 suggest you know reading the comments I
87:52 just can't stress that enough I mean why
87:54 would anyone tell you to read other
87:55 people's comments other than to gain
87:58 something from it so definitely
88:00 understand there's some great
88:01 conversations and I'm telling you this
88:03 is already happening I know because I'll
88:05 put out an episode and again I only get
88:09 notifications of your of your posts if
88:12 you're the original poster if you reply
88:16 to someone then I don't see it unless
88:19 you're replying directly to my initial
88:21 post if I'm replying in a chain with
88:22 other people I don't get your
88:23 notifications so I try to you know
88:26 expand and see how you guys are
88:28 dialoguing but boy have I seen some
88:30 great exchanges between people that are
88:32 just so constructive and everyone's
88:34 trying to climb higher and you're trying
88:36 to enlighten yourselves we're just in a
88:39 time when we're all waking up and the
88:40 Internet is the reason why it's
88:41 happening so why don't we make sure that
88:45 you exercise every day you know if
88:49 you've seen every episode I've ever put
88:51 out then I guess you could make your own
88:53 episodes or watry watch an old one or go
88:56 find something new for me to do an
88:57 episode on that I have
88:58 in pre-produce it for me if it's a lot
89:01 of content I would have to ingest to do
89:03 the episode then just pre produce it
89:04 like a producer you go in and say I read
89:09 this book I watch this video whatever it
89:11 is and minute 21 there's this amazing
89:13 Epiphany if you get me hooked on
89:15 something boy I'll do a deep dive and
89:17 you'll have an episode dedicated to you
89:18 I've done it several times but that's
89:21 where the website deep thoughts
89:22 radio.com comes in to Han now I'm having
89:27 to change the bumper a little bit
89:28 because we're facing an unknown on
89:30 YouTube December 10th they're gonna
89:33 throw out all these new policies and
89:34 they've claimed that they're gonna turn
89:37 off channels that aren't in their eyes
89:39 commercially viable whatever that means
89:42 right
89:43 hopefully we meet that requirement but
89:46 if it doesn't if we get nipped and the
89:49 show gets turned off well then you're
89:51 gonna have to go to the deep thoughts
89:52 radio com to get the feeds or have a
89:55 [ __ ] shoot account and hope to god they
89:57 survive right I have a lot of you try to
90:01 help me out with finding other resources
90:04 to post my videos the problem with our
90:07 situation is that the episodes are over
90:10 an hour almost unanimously and I don't
90:13 really want to cut everything into two
90:14 pieces to get it up on a site because I
90:16 don't think anyone ever gets to part 2
90:18 half the time and that's a lot of
90:20 investment for me to chop everything up
90:22 and so if you want to recommend a
90:26 platform do me a favor check out the
90:28 upload policy on videos and make sure
90:30 that they can go up to 2 hours because
90:33 that's as far as I go typically brighty
90:36 on is a joke right Eon is censored by
90:40 design I mean it is a joke it is like a
90:44 deep state hilarious joke and supposedly
90:46 the guy that runs the place is so anti
90:48 deep state but he needs to rethink his
90:50 model I mean come on [ __ ] shoot does it
90:53 they do it through a distributed
90:54 computer system but you can only put ten
90:57 videos up at a time and then those ten
90:59 videos have to hit this amazing few
91:01 counts which if I'm going to post my
91:04 channel I'm going to start out episode
91:05 one and go towards the current one but
91:09 you don't get another ten or twenty five
91:11 or whatever until your first ten are
91:12 popular well there you go you can't have
91:16 information it's not popular alright so
91:20 we would have to have you know I don't
91:22 even know a few thousand of you
91:24 dedicated to my bright tea on account to
91:27 go and watch the same video well you
91:30 know over and over and over again to get
91:31 the counts artificially up so I get to
91:34 the next twenty five and you got to
91:35 pound the twenty five to get me to the
91:37 next fifty or whatever it is it's it's
91:40 horrendous
91:41 so bright young can go bite it but I
91:45 haven't found a single other service
91:46 other than bid sheet that allows over an
91:48 hour so that's why I'm only on that
91:49 other alternative but on the website you
91:52 have to video YouTube and bid shoot you
91:54 have all the audio you'd ever need so
91:56 you can get on there and get hooked up
91:58 with the podcast there is two primary
92:01 social media which is locked Facebook
92:03 group I mentioned earlier the Twitter
92:05 account and mine's calm I'm not sure
92:08 it's going to survive but it is a
92:09 Facebook alternative again I think it's
92:12 way more beautiful than Facebook it has
92:14 a lot more cool features on it so here's
92:19 the thing please go up and create a bit
92:22 shoot account and then subscribe to the
92:23 channel because that'll help me out in
92:26 general but it will also make sure
92:28 you're already a part of bid shoot if
92:30 YouTube happens to clip this thing in
92:31 the middle of the morning great the
92:34 other one is some of the methods I used
92:35 to raise funds for the show and pays for
92:37 cigars at this point again I'm at
92:40 seventy-five bucks a month if I have a
92:42 great month so it is patreon and there's
92:48 a PayPal account the advertising on this
92:50 channel makes about fifty bucks a month
92:52 if I have a hot month just so you know
92:53 the most of ever made was last season I
92:56 think I cleared 100 bucks one time so
92:59 for those of you think I'm rolling in a
93:01 Bentley because of the show think again
93:04 okay but there's two products Backblaze
93:09 and brave definitely get the brave
93:11 browser that's all I'm gonna say today
93:13 there's no season 1 episodes on this
93:15 particular channel so go up there and
93:17 click on the other YouTube channel with
93:19 season 1 but if you go to bid shoot it's
93:21 all there it's just in 1080p the show
93:24 was in 1080p up until season
93:26 four and I bought this particular camera
93:28 which is 4k so I like to keep everything
93:31 in 4k because I think people watch it on
93:33 their televisions at home and it just
93:34 looks beautiful it's really great plus
93:36 the effect looks really cool too so
93:38 anyway that's all I've got for you
93:40 hopefully Doug the episode until the
93:42 next one take care of yourself and
93:44 someone else said I'll see on the next
93:45 deep thoughts over now
93:49 [Applause]
