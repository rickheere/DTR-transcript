00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts um what I anticipate to be
00:35 one of the last few weeks of summer in
00:39 Southern California
00:41 still pretty one there's your update as
00:46 promised here is another episode in the
00:49 series about the moon well we're gonna
00:51 break things down a little bit more than
00:54 previous episodes but there'll be a
00:57 tremendous amount of overlap of course
00:58 but I think that in all cases what
01:02 starts to happen with these episodes
01:04 it's almost like a Buddhist chant the
01:11 Buddhist chant has its variations but it
01:14 also has its repetition and each time
01:19 you go into that chan each time you go
01:21 into any type of mantra of thinking new
01:24 things occur to you and sometimes it
01:27 happens to me on the show and you get to
01:28 hear it other times it's you I'm saying
01:32 the same old crap but you're going off
01:34 in a completely different direction that
01:36 you've never been down before that I
01:37 have never conceived of and every once
01:40 in a while those brilliant comments come
01:42 into the comment section on YouTube or
01:44 get make it to the Facebook group a man
01:48 it changes changes everything
01:51 so I did you know the official deep dive
01:54 into the journey from Earth orbit to the
02:01 moon then the maneuver to separate the
02:07 service module from the lunar module or
02:10 limb it's spelled lem but the acronyms
02:15 LM and so they just start calling it LEM
02:17 putting a vowel in there just like the
02:19 Egyptians used to do back in the day and
02:22 then of course this thing has to land on
02:23 the moon safely and then it has to exist
02:29 in this incredible journey for days days
02:33 and days and days it's actually
02:35 astonishing how many days they want
02:38 us to believe that they had portable
02:40 energy sources to sustain these folks
02:44 it's absurd you know it just it just
02:50 occurred to me while preparing for this
02:51 episode that you know when it comes to
02:54 oxygen that an individual has to have in
02:58 order to stay alive as well as water
03:01 right you know the last mission of
03:05 Apollo 17 was 12 days and 13 hours so
03:11 imagine trying to stay alive for 13 days
03:15 anywhere on planet or 12.5 days I so you
03:20 could be anywhere you want in the world
03:21 but you're gonna have to bring what you
03:23 need to survive and I mean you're in a
03:25 vacuum of a box you don't have oxygen
03:27 you don't have water you got to bring it
03:29 all just trying to prepare for that
03:32 solitude would be very interesting and
03:36 expensive but there's some of you that
03:37 are divers you do deep-sea diving you
03:41 know with tanks and that sort of thing I
03:42 don't even know if they call it do you
03:44 see probably not do you see but you have
03:46 an amount of oxygen that you have to
03:48 bring on your back to survive how many
03:53 tanks would you have to have on your
03:55 back to breathe for 12 days now
03:58 obviously when they're inside the
03:59 service module there's three of them
04:01 together when they supposedly crawl
04:03 through this nose cone of the service
04:05 module the little capsule to get into
04:08 the limb then you have another
04:11 environment so you're keeping one
04:13 environment which is the service module
04:15 capsule wherever staying up in the case
04:17 of Apollo 11 it was Michael Collins and
04:19 then Buzz Aldrin and the Armstrong crawl
04:22 into the limb and then they've got their
04:24 little mission down on the ground
04:27 there's was a mere eight days so you
04:31 have obviously some flight time and then
04:33 you have some down on the surface time
04:38 and I apologize it is windy today's the
04:41 mics gonna go in and out of being
04:43 bombarded now in addition to all these
04:47 tanks of air that we're gonna have to
04:50 bring you know today they recycle urine
04:53 into water and supposedly in the space
04:55 station we definitely know that's
04:57 possible
04:58 for many different you know submarines
05:00 and you know it's just a bunch of
05:01 different uses of that technology but in
05:06 69 it'd probably be cheaper just to
05:09 drink water but imagine how much you
05:12 urinate in eight days imagine how much
05:17 you might defecate in eight days yeah
05:20 let's say your pent up a little bit
05:21 because you know you're on the moon so
05:25 your body your bowels lock up but I bet
05:28 Vice Apollo 17 a 12-day mission I'm
05:31 willing to bet you can't keep everything
05:32 in your body that you're eating not that
05:35 you eat a whole lot of like 16-ounce
05:36 steaks or anything but interesting we
05:41 think we could think about a moisture
05:42 absorbing diaper taking care of perhaps
05:44 the fluids but the other side of the
05:47 game Wow would be rough wouldn't it but
05:51 we're in low orbit we're a little less
05:54 than a 200 miles up and they need to get
05:59 to the moon and I did read the sort of
06:03 play-by-play Wikipedia of several of the
06:07 Apollo missions that went to the moon
06:09 especially 8 and 10 in addition that
06:13 went there never attempted to land and
06:15 then came back they have a firing
06:17 sequence
06:18 on the schedule that's supposed to allow
06:21 them to escape this gigantic marble in
06:23 space but I want you to think about it
06:27 for one second here every time we see
06:30 Earth from space as per and NASA
06:33 photograph it is almost categorically
06:36 always and I'm unaware if I've seen a
06:39 photograph that isn't in this so for my
06:42 experience I believe it's a hundred
06:44 percent of the time just assuming
06:47 there's some exceptions to this rule but
06:49 it's always in a fisheye lens
06:51 every single time isn't it the earth is
06:54 extremely small looking and super round
06:57 but when you start looking at the
06:59 continents down on this thing they don't
07:02 quite look right I mean though they're
07:04 you know they're way too big for the
07:06 curvature of the earth so you know that
07:07 this thing's being curved as they are on
07:10 this supposed space station they're
07:13 moving the camera around the curvature
07:16 of the earth is like wonky it's like
07:18 constantly changing because the fisheye
07:20 lenses you know in different distort
07:22 levels but if you see some of the shots
07:25 that are of like the Hurricanes you know
07:27 or the ground where they're just
07:29 literally shooting down the one portal
07:31 little Han Solo portal window that they
07:35 put on the space station the only points
07:37 at the earth right it's a space station
07:40 and there's not a portal going up the
07:42 opposite direction to look at what space
07:44 alright
07:45 you wouldn't want to look at the moon
07:47 you know I mean it's it is by sheer
07:51 design and sheer priority to avoid
07:54 looking at space the thing that they
07:56 can't simulate easily with a camera
07:58 right you know if you had a camera and
08:00 you're like oh let's go look at some
08:02 constellations what we're gonna do is
08:04 we're going to turn down the lights and
08:05 these last two modules to get the camera
08:08 acclimated to low light exposure I'm
08:11 gonna open up the aperture of the camera
08:12 and they're just going to point it out
08:13 the window at Orion you know Sirius the
08:16 North Star or whatever Polaris they
08:21 never do it because creating that level
08:23 of accuracy would be extremely difficult
08:25 and if they so much as pointed it in the
08:27 wrong way and then back down at Earth or
08:29 the other portal you would probably find
08:32 out that the geometry doesn't work
08:33 because the studio in which some of
08:35 these things are being shot they can't
08:37 possibly align everything right when
08:41 they are pointing it directly at the
08:42 earth you start to get an idea of the
08:46 tiny little speck that we are and the
08:49 gigantic ball that is the earth again
08:52 bubbles and water so I remember guys
08:54 water's ether the bubbles earth that's
08:57 how it all works but the earth is almost
09:00 eight thousand miles in diameter twenty
09:03 four thousand miles around
09:05 thus a 24-hour day huge huge huge huge
09:10 thing and we're supposed to be able to
09:13 start a little tiny engine that again
09:17 you just take the distance of the
09:20 service module with the lunar module
09:22 attached to it as it gets into orbit and
09:26 then divide it by find its length and
09:29 divide it by the length of the earth
09:31 which is roughly seventy nine hundred
09:32 miles plus and that's the percentage of
09:38 ratio between the two diameters so
09:42 starting an engine to escape this
09:44 gigantic ball is extremely humorous to
09:48 me this weird ass prop plane flies over
09:52 now they will tell you and they are
09:54 rightfully so that the the force is
09:58 created that are typically known as
10:01 gravity are a weak force as in relation
10:05 to everything else that's going on you
10:07 know I would love to to do a comparison
10:11 between just the average gravity field
10:13 of a particular object and that of which
10:16 holds the the orbital etho matter that
10:20 makes a an atom there's a tremendous
10:23 amount of pressure holding an atom
10:25 together
10:25 those little currents are extremely
10:28 powerful but they're also not trying to
10:30 hang on 100% to the materials that make
10:33 them it's a flowing thing it's a current
10:35 in a river the current is just an
10:37 impression of water doing a little
10:40 vortex thing and the water continues
10:41 down the the river so in terms of
10:45 holding the energy there it is holding
10:48 the vortex of how things work right but
10:52 escaping the Earth's gravity from 200
10:55 miles up which again I think is less
10:58 than was it the the atmosphere of the
11:02 earth is thinner than the paint on a
11:09 basketball because way my physics
11:11 teacher taught it I'm quite sure if
11:13 that's technically correct or how that's
11:14 defined the 200 miles up is fair
11:18 decent secure lower orbit but 200 miles
11:23 up is not a bad altitude right
11:26 certainly a conceivable percentage of
11:28 the Earth's diameter 800 miles up would
11:32 be 10% so we're going down to around a
11:37 percent or so little over percent maybe
11:39 so this thing has to fire up and it's
11:42 all the sequences they say that there's
11:43 a little engine here goes for five
11:45 minutes this one might go for 17 minutes
11:48 but the idea is that this unit as now
11:55 arbitrarily breaking off from this again
11:57 you have the slingshot thing you know
12:00 technically speaking the slingshot
12:02 theory when you start off on the body
12:06 that you're on and you have to create a
12:09 larger and larger orbit this motor would
12:11 have to fire for a really long time and
12:13 the footage of Earth would go far away a
12:17 close-up far away close-up I'd be doing
12:19 this thing when Buzz Aldrin was shown
12:22 the photograph or the the movie proof of
12:26 the leaked reel that went to bart sibrel
12:30 sobral calm he never said because the
12:34 whole thing is stamped in chronological
12:36 reverse order the earth was far away at
12:38 first and then it was closed up the more
12:40 they perfected the shot inside the lunar
12:42 capsule and he never said oh but that's
12:45 the slingshot that's what happens with
12:47 the slingshot you're going far away then
12:48 you're coming back and far away and we
12:50 just simply recorded one of those little
12:51 loops nope
12:53 NASA back in the day okay said that it
12:58 was a perfectly round orbit and then
13:00 poof you just go to the moon because you
13:03 just turn on a little motor and you go
13:05 it's not gonna happen like that or it's
13:07 gonna grab you back you might end up in
13:10 today's technology creating a massive
13:12 orbit around Earth whether or not you
13:15 can get it to 237 miles and miles out is
13:19 unknown at this point but you have to
13:23 remember if you start going at the moon
13:26 and you miss getting in orbit around the
13:31 moon theoretically speed
13:32 Keeney okay and again you're gonna have
13:33 to have some slingshot thing around the
13:35 mood - you can't just get to the moon
13:37 and go in a nice little orbit the entire
13:38 time you're gonna have to overshoot it
13:40 I'm gonna come back and all this other
13:42 stuff and they they never have updated
13:45 the Apollo mission diagrams to match
13:49 what's going on with their fake Mars
13:54 reconnaissance satellites Jupiter
13:57 reconnaissance satellites they've now
13:58 got the theories down theories okay
14:01 about how that could work but they never
14:02 updated how the moon work they we never
14:04 seen any animations about them going out
14:06 and then this closing elliptical orbit
14:08 around the moon and isn't it funny that
14:11 every single orbital thing that goes
14:14 around Jupiter crashes into Jupiter
14:16 eventually right
14:17 so stabilizing the orbit once you get to
14:20 the moon is gonna be a [ __ ] it will be
14:23 extremely difficult and you're gonna
14:24 have to have fuel and you're gonna have
14:26 to toy with it especially if you've
14:28 never been there before now one thing I
14:32 want to clarify is that we do sort of
14:38 have the the gravity figured out of the
14:41 moon but there is a catch because we
14:46 really don't know what the moon is made
14:47 out of and we don't know how much it
14:49 weighs technically we don't know what
14:51 it's at its center they're trying to
14:52 tell you everything's got nickel-iron
14:53 when it's plasma if it the difference
14:56 between the moon being hollow and the
14:58 moon having nickel-iron Center or some
15:00 sort of hard center with their theory of
15:04 phenomenon gravity which is the atoms
15:06 communicate with each other and pull
15:07 each other towards each other that would
15:10 drastically change okay how we approach
15:16 an orbit of the moon potentially now
15:21 what they do know is how aggressive
15:24 gravity is they do understand when we
15:26 drop things we know exactly what
15:27 terminal velocity does and so we
15:30 generally can calculate backwards well
15:33 something that big being held in orbit
15:36 around Earth can't it's got to be in
15:38 this range because if it was any heavier
15:40 it might slam into us if it's any
15:42 lighter it might fly off or maybe it's
15:44 lighter started comes at us and if it's
15:45 a virgos
15:47 so for me I don't have any problem with
15:49 those the mathematics of figuring that
15:51 out but it would I think there's some
15:54 wiggle room in there that I've never
15:55 heard discussed now with my theory of
15:59 ether Oh gravity that I picked up off of
16:01 Eric dollar thus all the the classical
16:04 scientists you know their thing is that
16:07 if you have displacement of ether a big
16:10 hollow plasma ball in the center of all
16:14 celestial bodies it doesn't matter how
16:16 dense it is as long as it blocks ether
16:18 it is exactly like having a hard Center
16:22 so perhaps that's how the two theories
16:24 balance themselves out or one they can
16:26 come up with the theory that works on
16:28 paper but they're wrong about what is
16:30 causing it and we come in with the
16:32 classic knowledge that Tesla used to
16:33 create all of his instruments all of his
16:36 theories all of his patents and it was
16:39 all ether abased just kind of want to
16:41 throw that in there so now we have a
16:44 service module which is a little bullet
16:46 shaped thing with the little rocket
16:49 engine on the back and we're gonna stay
16:52 here for a little while before we get
16:53 down to the moon's surface I was gonna
16:55 make a whole episode about just getting
16:58 to the moon surface but I don't think I
17:00 would have an hour and a half to do to
17:02 talk about that now before we go much
17:05 further than just the service module
17:08 okay there's an old buoy made in 1908
17:12 called the excursion to the moon it was
17:14 a silent movie it was a brilliant movie
17:16 in fact the more that I looked at it the
17:18 more my mind just blows but what was the
17:23 the prop that went to the moon it's
17:27 stuck in the moon's I remember that the
17:29 moon's a guy's face I mean the the utter
17:32 brilliance of mankind 100 plus years ago
17:35 so Dwarfs today's creativity it is
17:40 utterly painful to be awake and realize
17:43 how [ __ ] stupid we are today I'm
17:46 sorry for just the f-bomb but that's it
17:48 we were so creative back in the days it
17:50 was ridiculous we invented whole new
17:52 errors of art and that doesn't happen
17:54 anymore today as a bunch of Chinese
17:57 knockoff crap that you know hey your
17:59 phone
17:59 disposable you know could you imagine if
18:02 someone told you forty years ago that
18:04 your home phone was disposable that was
18:06 only supposed to last two years but it
18:08 cost $1,500 or and you had to pay you
18:12 know 150 bucks a month for it just
18:15 imagine all of you who are 40 or over
18:17 those phones that we just had on the
18:19 walls the little things the ringers
18:21 inside of them and someone telling you
18:22 that that device is going to run you
18:27 three thousand dollars a year and two
18:30 years later you know you're supposed to
18:32 buy a brand new one it's crazy
18:35 but anyway excursion to the moon had a
18:37 bullet-shaped thing that was gonna fire
18:40 out of a cannon it did
18:41 fires out of a cannon flies to the moon
18:44 hits him in the eye and he's like and
18:45 he's got you know this funny ass facial
18:48 expression of being poked in the eye and
18:52 you know goes on - everyone gets off of
18:55 this gets out of this capsule and comes
18:58 back home eventually so isn't it
19:01 interesting that the creators of this
19:04 entire endeavor seemed to have lifted a
19:10 theory out of a movie at the time would
19:15 have been 61 years old
19:19 excuse me yeah 61 years old yeah based
19:23 completely on what was possible to film
19:25 in a silent movie it seems like that
19:29 kind of makes sense seems like you have
19:30 to have a little bit of fuel the back
19:32 part of this is a two-part thing right
19:34 there's this big sort of cylinder with
19:37 the engine on it then you have the
19:40 capsule which is the bullet shaped part
19:42 of it
19:43 most of the back part is all fuel to get
19:46 that engine to push them supposedly out
19:48 of low orbit escaping this gigantic
19:51 8,000 mile wide ball in space hauling
19:57 ass towards another 1,200 mile wide ball
20:00 two hundred and thirty seven thousand
20:04 miles away and moving around the earth
20:08 so you've got to compensate for
20:11 everything the moon doesn't just sit
20:13 there
20:13 right now of course there's a bunch of
20:16 relative speeds that they can talk about
20:18 but once you leave the earth and the
20:20 Saturn 5 rocket you're gaining a very
20:22 different orientation to the Earth's
20:25 surface than all of us that might be
20:27 staring at a full moon all day long
20:29 right we're rotating and the moon is
20:32 rotating and again there's this complete
20:35 mystery as to what the hell the moon
20:37 really is you know go see my episode on
20:39 the moon I think it's in season 2 it
20:43 might be in season 1 but it's the moon
20:46 is a very mysterious object no matter
20:48 how you think about it we only see one
20:50 side of the Moon which is astronomically
20:53 against the odds that there wouldn't be
20:55 now here's the thing some people say
20:58 yeah well you know hey you're just
20:59 stupid you don't understand rotational
21:01 mathematics blah blah blah well I'm not
21:03 that guy
21:04 - if there was remotely a tiny speed
21:10 differential on the rotation of the moon
21:12 very slowly over a hundred years let's
21:15 say or a thousand years it would rotate
21:17 all the way around slowly
21:19 so we could see the back side of the
21:20 moon no for the moon's lifetime
21:23 and again supposedly Plato talked about
21:27 reading books before the moon okay like
21:31 it didn't exist all until suddenly but
21:34 this thing is up there and we only see
21:36 perfectly one side of the Moon they tell
21:41 us that our Sun is 93 million miles away
21:43 yet during any solar eclipse the moon
21:47 perfectly blocks out the Sun and I mean
21:50 perfectly I had some [ __ ] debate this
21:51 we know it doesn't but the guy doesn't
21:55 know what a solar eclipse is right when
21:57 it perfectly lines up you get a blacked
21:59 out sky and then you see the crescent
22:02 ring pop out of one side it's it's a
22:05 phenomenal experience I saw this once
22:07 when I was I think eight years old in
22:10 Derby Kansas just funny my mother went
22:14 jogging and left me at the house it was
22:18 like early evening and this happens and
22:21 the whole sky goes dark and and all the
22:23 neighbors are outside and everyone's
22:24 like yelling and screaming and loving it
22:26 my mom got really afraid that I I was at
22:29 home and I might be freaking out and I
22:31 was spinning I was like man bring the
22:32 UFOs I'm ready so the moon is a really
22:36 strange thing let's just let's not
22:38 overlook that so the surface module
22:43 looks like the bullet from a movie made
22:44 1908 a little strange the lunar module
22:48 is this I think a in my opinion almost a
22:55 design catastrophe it's a four legged
22:59 spaceship sort of it and here's what I
23:06 noticed okay anytime you look at the
23:09 statues that are sort of celebratory you
23:13 know commemorating the moment of going
23:15 to the moon they're pretty sexy the
23:17 limbs are pretty sexy all of the
23:20 ridiculous construction that you see in
23:21 the photographs of these things on the
23:23 moon are gone
23:24 it looks tight it looks solid the one
23:30 you look at the real thing you start to
23:33 see shower rods tent poles tinfoil you
23:37 see sheet metal that's not fastened down
23:41 well it looked like something made in
23:45 utter haste which I don't understand
23:47 because the the limb was on paper and
23:50 they built prototypes for nearly half a
23:52 decade before they ever said they used
23:56 it on the moon in fact the first one was
24:00 all white and very very tight and its
24:04 design how they got to this thing on the
24:10 moon I don't know maybe someone looked
24:11 at it said that doesn't look scientific
24:13 enough get out some foil get out some
24:15 flat black metal now interestingly
24:20 enough the gentleman who did the hot air
24:23 balloon thing in the early 30s who said
24:27 that the earth looked like a disc with
24:28 upturn edges he tried to perfect a
24:34 technique where he knew that the Sun
24:36 would be on one side of him and he
24:39 needed to make sure that when he was up
24:41 there floating in his balloon that he
24:45 would reflect away the Sun so that his
24:48 capsule wouldn't get SuperDuper hot and
24:50 then he absorbed with the black side of
24:53 of the sphere that he was in the
24:56 darkness of space to keep it warmed up
24:58 trying to balance the heat now what
25:00 ended up occurring was that the thing
25:02 rotated badly and it didn't work he
25:06 couldn't stabilize it but if you go and
25:08 look at the other experiments of a
25:11 couple guys it was a Steve Fossett and
25:13 Richard Branson who went up they managed
25:16 to stabilize the container which they
25:18 were in interesting the limb has a lot
25:24 of dark stuff around the actual living
25:27 quarters which I would assume would
25:29 absorb light and thus get extremely hot
25:33 inside every single one of you have been
25:38 in a car with the Sun out and the second
25:43 that you turn the air conditioner off in
25:45 Texas or Phoenix Arizona or Miami
25:49 Florida or Dubai it's a matter of
25:53 seconds before you start to heat up
25:55 before the excited atmospheric particles
25:58 and the and the agitation of the sun's
26:00 verbal waves of electron or photons
26:03 excuse me start to vibrate the car that
26:06 it starts to vibrate and you start to
26:08 get really warm all right now you're in
26:11 this supposed vacuum of space
26:13 getting it radiated by the Sun you have
26:17 no Van Allen belt to protect you you
26:19 have no atmosphere to protect you
26:21 remember water is an amazing insulator
26:24 against radiation so is lead so is
26:27 cement so while we're sitting here
26:30 underneath this blue sky
26:32 we have a lot of fluid between us and
26:35 outer space again the greenhouse gas
26:40 layer index of which attributes and
26:42 accounts for all warming of this planet
26:45 after the Sun sends over its rays is
26:51 99.99999% water the amount of co2 in
26:56 there is again point zero five four
27:00 percent of a single percent so this
27:03 whole climate change global warming
27:05 thing it's just a complete scientific
27:07 horseshit
27:08 okay so without all that insulation you
27:13 know
27:13 the lethal amount of radiation coming
27:15 off the Sun would kill all the about
27:18 astronauts in the capsule that is only a
27:20 quarter inch aluminum quarter-inch
27:24 people now that's being just in space
27:28 where everything is flowing by your ship
27:30 now I want you to land on a big giant
27:34 reflector called the moon's surface and
27:37 not only you're getting hit by it in
27:39 your spacesuit which is just cloth and
27:41 rubber but it's coming back off the
27:43 ground and hitting you twice it's
27:46 probably lost a little bit of its CUSIP
27:49 power but any of you who've skied you
27:52 know when I first time I skied at 13
27:54 snow skied
27:56 I was I was brown when I came home but
28:01 wear my goggles where I was pure white
28:03 because the you know you get suntan off
28:06 the off the Sun in general but off the
28:08 snow all right all the supplies in space
28:14 to men so here they are flying with this
28:18 bizarre barnacle on the front and again
28:20 there's no problem with aerodynamics
28:22 once they get out of the atmosphere of
28:24 the earth you have this weird thing on
28:27 the end
28:28 now the Van Allen belts which have been
28:31 verified and verified and verified is
28:34 extremely lethal start at 1,000 miles up
28:38 then they're 25,000 miles thick and then
28:41 they pretty much taper off and it goes
28:43 back to the vacuum of space which is not
28:45 a vacuum it's full of ether
28:46 articles and dust and all kinds of crap
28:48 but that 1998 article that bart sibrel
28:51 put in his movie a funny thing happened
28:53 on the way to the moon which you should
28:54 get a signed copy of it's a Broadcom the
28:58 lead in you know I've mentioned this
29:00 several times would want you to be able
29:01 to remember this as well the lead in
29:04 article title was nASA says the
29:07 something to the fact that NASA says
29:09 that the Van Allen belts are more lethal
29:11 than they previously thought and where
29:13 do they come up with this there was a
29:15 space shuttle mission which I think has
29:16 been scrubbed from the history books as
29:18 well as that articles been scrubbed that
29:23 astronauts went up over 400 miles inside
29:26 the space shuttle and everyone started
29:29 seeing shooting stars with their eyes
29:32 closed how do they do that well because
29:35 the radiation would be going through the
29:38 whole of the space shuttle through their
29:40 helmets if they have any on definitely
29:42 through the skulls hitting their rods
29:44 and cones in their eyes and then boom
29:46 you start to see things they also
29:49 reported people getting sick they have
29:51 to descend a hundred miles roughly in
29:54 orbit as I read through it way back in
29:57 the day everybody got sick then they
29:59 brought the mission home I tried to find
30:02 that mission and I D I couldn't find
30:03 anything like that I couldn't find
30:04 anything that high up and I couldn't
30:07 find any anomalies in any missions in 98
30:11 so getting through the Van Allen belts
30:13 will always be the bane of our attempt
30:15 to try and enter space we will need to
30:19 create a ship that is capable of keeping
30:24 the electromagnetic field of the Van
30:27 Allen belts on the outside of the ship
30:29 again as I suggested in my making a UFO
30:33 episode create a nano-based fiber that
30:39 acts as a Faraday cage and then we could
30:42 not only drive through the Van Allen
30:44 belts but we could route that energy
30:45 down inside engines that we could then
30:49 use to perhaps do anti-gravity or
30:51 whatever but that's just fantasy now
30:56 isn't it so here we are let's just say
30:59 we throw
31:00 this ridiculous bone that one that they
31:02 can get out of orbit of Earth through
31:03 some slingshot technique of which they
31:05 have no fuel to actually accomplish to
31:07 create the the appropriate amount of
31:10 force to leave the Earth's gravitational
31:12 force right and that's say for the very
31:16 first time an Apollo 8 especially they
31:18 have this thing down pat the very first
31:21 time here comes this the service module
31:27 screaming towards the moon perfectly get
31:31 it in orbit right and now they're in
31:34 this slingshot orbit again we have to
31:37 give you the 69 slingshot orbit which is
31:40 immediately perfect there's no
31:43 descending orbits like every other
31:46 slingshot Theory in Hollywood and in
31:48 there
31:49 Hollywood Mars and Jupiter and Saturn
31:51 stuff okay so let's just give them all
31:56 those impossibility z' now you've got
31:59 this limb thing attached to the service
32:02 module capsule and there's a little door
32:06 between the two right out of the top and
32:09 supposedly by the way there's an inner
32:11 cone inside the cone which is where all
32:14 the parachutes are packed such that when
32:16 they come home this space that is
32:18 probably smaller than a couple suitcases
32:21 that you might take to the airport with
32:23 your goods they are packing three of the
32:25 biggest parachutes you've ever seen in
32:27 your life
32:27 supposedly pack down to the density of
32:30 tree bark and somehow they can just
32:33 throw it outside and it'll turn into a
32:35 parachute completely utterly absurd but
32:39 whatever now we have this thing in
32:42 Apollo 11 first time it's ever been done
32:46 they detached you know the two
32:49 astronauts climb over in this particular
32:50 case be buzz-buzz Aldrin and Neil
32:52 Armstrong they're crawling through this
32:54 little tiny aperture again with their
32:56 spacesuits on which makes them nearly
32:59 three feet thick the hatch isn't big
33:03 enough to fit them but they're doing it
33:05 anyway maybe they went over naked and
33:08 then you know kind of stuffed the
33:10 backpack through the hole whatever
33:12 I put everything back on it's not the
33:17 way it's portrayed in the history books
33:18 okay so they climbed through this hole
33:20 now it's time to disengage from the
33:22 service module and get down to the moon
33:26 okay so what's actually occurring here
33:31 we are talking about landing in it in a
33:36 area with no atmosphere we're gonna use
33:40 rockets in a non atmospheric world the
33:44 amount of folks coming out of their
33:46 college degrees with scientific
33:48 background saying there's no way that a
33:50 rocket can work in space in a vacuum of
33:52 space is growing exponentially there's a
33:55 lot of you in the comments section and I
33:57 am now gravitating that way myself
34:00 but again let's give them their fantasy
34:03 physics little tiny you know cone retro
34:07 rocket things are starting to push this
34:09 thing down so they've detached and
34:10 they've retro rocketed this thing to
34:12 turn and it's different than being in
34:15 low orbit of Earth it is different than
34:18 just being in low orbit of Earth we're
34:20 now way out there in a body in space
34:23 that has no atmosphere whatsoever if it
34:26 did us looking at the moon would have a
34:28 completely different experience it'd be
34:30 distorted to have a color hue it'd be a
34:32 different thing it rotates and then it
34:35 starts puff puff puff puff puff of
34:36 pushing itself down but it's also
34:40 hauling mega ass that's the other huge
34:44 problem how many times you've seen the
34:48 footage of the moon surface skimming
34:50 underneath these vehicles from Apollo 11
34:53 all the way up to Paolo 17 it's moving
34:57 quick man how many of you have been
35:01 driving your car at 60 miles an hour and
35:02 you look out over the hood of your car
35:04 and you're thinking to yourself that
35:05 doesn't look like I'm going that fast
35:07 then you look out your window and you're
35:09 like holy [ __ ] if I follow those car at
35:10 60 I'd be you know human pate on the
35:13 highway well let me just remind you this
35:17 limb is going way way faster than that
35:21 from a
35:22 horizontal standpoint but how's the limb
35:26 designed well it's got these retrorocket
35:30 things which can change its orientation
35:31 it has supposedly a 10,000 pound thrust
35:35 cone at the bottom slash engine which
35:37 has been miniaturized from all the other
35:39 engines that we've seen again if you
35:43 take an average f1 Rocketdyne booster or
35:46 even back to the j2 the the combustion
35:49 system that goes over the cone is so
35:52 huge that it would penetrate the living
35:55 quarters of the actual limb itself and
35:59 supposedly with you know you all I could
36:05 say is we were racing to get this thing
36:08 to work properly and to work in a way
36:11 that it wouldn't eventually explode to
36:14 weight that to the extent that it could
36:16 use the amount of fuel that we could
36:17 ferry or you know in the fuselage of I
36:19 guess that's what you call it of the
36:20 rocket itself to make it economical to
36:24 get it into space we have this magic
36:26 10,000 pound thrust engine but what's
36:28 that thing gonna do well if you played
36:32 that old video game Lunar Lander where
36:35 you have a lunar module and it's just
36:37 tilting back and forth and tilting back
36:39 and forth you are now tilting I guess in
36:43 the direction that you're going
36:44 horizontally to try and slow the damn
36:46 thing down so the ground starts moving
36:48 around zero miles an hour what you want
36:51 to be in is damn near geocentric orbit
36:54 with this moon surface but only you know
36:57 a few feet off the ground until you
36:59 until you land there is test footage
37:03 inside of an office where they had built
37:07 a sandpit and they had a model of this
37:11 limb on a pulley and they kept dropping
37:13 it and dropping it and drop it and every
37:15 time they did it
37:16 it rolled over they tried five legs they
37:18 tried four legs they eventually set it
37:20 on four you think five would be better
37:22 but somehow they settled on four I just
37:26 think it's big after a while right think
37:28 it's huge in the real world they've been
37:32 trying to fly something like this over a
37:35 parking lot crash
37:36 and burns every single time never saw it
37:38 function properly before we landed on
37:40 the moon that's a nice little piece of
37:42 trivia as a matter of fact NASA tried up
37:45 until I think a decade and a half ago to
37:48 do what SpaceX did perfect on the first
37:50 try which is supposedly laying these
37:52 boosters back down on the rocket pads
37:54 again none of us mortal human beings are
37:56 invited to see that live so that's fake
37:59 and tell any of us see it live and I
38:01 don't give a [ __ ] what's on YouTube if
38:03 one of us doesn't see that you can trust
38:05 anything happen but you're in the vacuum
38:09 of space and now you're blowing a bunch
38:11 of fire out of a cone and supposedly the
38:14 moon gives a [ __ ] about the force that
38:16 you're exerting on yourself in space
38:19 that's why people think Rockets don't
38:21 work in the vacuum of space so you're
38:23 pushing on yourself that's great
38:25 relative to what how are you able to
38:28 adjust your relative speed in space by
38:32 just blowing a bunch of fire out of a
38:34 bottom of a cone the theory is that the
38:36 fire is pushing on the cone and so
38:38 you're kind of doing it that way maybe
38:40 maybe that works I would certainly not
38:44 like to be Buzz Aldrin and Neil
38:45 Armstrong and find out that that isn't
38:47 the case on the very first try but they
38:50 have to make up a lot of speed they have
38:53 to then perfectly match this descent
38:58 descent rate excuse me and there for
39:01 momentum and I never saw anything that
39:03 claimed that the lunar module was
39:05 sideways trying to you know reduce its
39:07 overall horizontal speed perhaps that's
39:09 the way it worked I never saw that in
39:12 any animation matter of fact the the
39:16 animation while they sorry the footage
39:17 that they submit to us of this thing
39:19 going down to the moon is extremely
39:22 uniform and perpendicular to the ground
39:24 so that the tripod legs or that you know
39:27 quadrupedal eggs are perpendicular with
39:29 the surface of the Moon as it goes down
39:31 maybe they did this big turn thing and
39:34 started firing like the Lunar Module
39:36 video game okay or lunar lander video
39:39 game
39:40 now there's a bunch of drama around the
39:44 landing on the moon which is that this
39:46 computer that's on board using this rope
39:51 memory which has got to be some of the
39:53 most wildly conceived stuff on planet
39:56 Earth apparently works otherwise they
39:59 wouldn't have made it if you see the
40:00 factory floor than building this rote
40:02 memory your brain starts to hurt at how
40:05 they ended up trying to use coil wires
40:09 through this lattice of beams to
40:13 distinguish a positive and a negative
40:15 inside of a binary computer
40:18 I didn't hear until geez in the last two
40:22 years that this idea that as the lunar
40:25 module is coming down to land it must
40:27 use computer control retros and stuff to
40:30 make this all take place and it
40:33 essentially removes the human element
40:34 right Neil Armstrong or Buzz holding a
40:38 joystick and controlling things they
40:40 don't really have to do much because the
40:41 computer has to do it in a few seconds
40:44 before actual impact with the surface of
40:47 the Moon according to the official story
40:49 the computer crashed but the computer
40:50 was designed to reboot immediately and
40:52 because there's not much to it it
40:55 reboots fairly quickly and it managed to
40:57 save the day at the end so they take
41:00 this very skeptical computer design and
41:03 they make it a hero so that you don't
41:06 analyze it anymore
41:07 well the computer is a hero if the
41:09 computer didn't work that everybody
41:10 would have died that's why it's totally
41:11 real okay and there's aliens on the moon
41:14 which makes your landings totally real
41:17 so I have a big big big problem with the
41:21 landing on the moon the actual moment
41:23 that was captured on film supposedly out
41:26 the window to the lunar module on the
41:28 surface of this studio in Hollywood
41:30 great their groom lake or wherever the
41:33 hell they filmed this thing a little
41:36 little pads that are covered with all
41:38 this wild copper foil have not a single
41:42 speck of dust on them but as you watch
41:45 the footage of them landing on the moon
41:47 you start to see metric tons of dust
41:51 flying
41:53 around this window great or outside the
41:56 window now do you realize that if this
41:58 thing or even going five miles an hour
42:03 or ten miles an hour it's going to do
42:05 what that prototype did in the office
42:07 it's gonna roll over it's gonna dig in
42:09 its heels and it's gonna roll over but
42:11 you saw it land yeah supposedly in this
42:15 footage right it did bump when it hit
42:19 and it would bump now one of our
42:22 listeners claimed that there are these
42:24 again these steel boxes that were
42:27 designed to crush as soon as it has hit
42:29 the moon's surface if that's the case
42:31 that's ingenious that's a great idea and
42:33 that will definitely subdue the impact
42:36 but what is it what is it actually gonna
42:38 subdue its going to subdue the impact
42:41 above the box the legs below the box are
42:45 still gonna dig into the ground you're
42:46 still gonna go bump bump right given
42:51 that they knew that the moon surface is
42:53 not flat by any stretch of the
42:57 imagination you know they was a sea of
42:59 tranquillity and that kind of stuff
43:00 appears to be a lot smoother than the
43:02 rest of the stuff but what if one leg
43:05 hit a little spire of a rock right it's
43:09 like a iceberg down below it's it's a
43:13 rock the size of New York State but up
43:15 above it's just a little tiny 10-inch
43:18 Rock so if a leg had hit that you would
43:21 be on your side in two seconds so many
43:25 of the other landing zones 12 14 through
43:30 17 had incredibly hostile surfaces that
43:35 they landed next to in fact one of them
43:37 you know lands I can't remember exactly
43:40 which one but there's one where it
43:41 landed very very close to a boulder that
43:44 was about the size of a small bus can
43:49 you imagine can you imagine landing next
43:51 is something that unmovable you would
43:57 destroy your vehicle and you would
43:59 distort your vehicle in a way that
44:00 you're not going home and here's the
44:02 thing how did they get home after
44:04 they've done their giant you know
44:07 four day five days stay on the surface
44:09 of the Moon Plus right that lunar module
44:13 has to be perfect pointing straight up
44:16 because they're gonna blast this this
44:20 this dynamite or whatever underneath the
44:23 thing and it's gonna go straight up in
44:24 the air if it is off by a fraction of a
44:28 degree you are no longer going to ever
44:30 ever rendezvous with the service module
44:33 and that alone should give you proof
44:36 that this whole thing is completely and
44:38 utterly ridiculous the amount of utter
44:40 perfection and perfectness of all things
44:44 has to be 100% otherwise this isn't
44:48 going to occur but let's just keep going
44:52 with their fantasy supposedly they're
44:54 able to use this rocket engine in space
44:57 and unless again they turn against their
45:00 vector their differential between their
45:03 speed and the speed of the surface of
45:07 the Moon and I know what people are
45:08 gonna think well they were in geocentric
45:10 orbit anyway right let's add another
45:13 whole layer of cake of complete and
45:17 utter impossibility that from Earth
45:20 they're coming towards the moon and
45:22 you're getting this perfect orbit with
45:24 the moon hey the thing faces us all year
45:28 round so you're gonna have to basically
45:30 come to a standstill in space to get
45:34 this thing to work but no the service
45:36 module is still going in orbit around
45:38 the moon so it can't be that geocentric
45:40 you know so it separates it does this
45:44 maneuver that no one could have ever
45:45 tested on Earth a 1969 or before who
45:49 heard that retro rocketing down slowed
45:51 themselves down and land miraculously
45:55 and the six missions that succeeded
45:57 supposedly and touching the moon surface
46:00 not a single speck of dust ever got on
46:02 those feet every single time
46:06 utter and complete perfection right what
46:12 on earth have we ever done with I don't
46:15 know one thousandth of the complexity
46:18 happens perfect every time
46:20 does a this is a kicker in the NFL have
46:24 the ability to kick two balls through a
46:26 goal the same exact way there's a hockey
46:30 guy have the ability to knock a puck
46:31 into a goal the same exact way every
46:34 single time
46:35 do you drive to work and stay in the
46:38 perfect Lane every single time never
46:41 you're never able to replicate this
46:43 utter and complete perfection with the
46:45 variables that are those events but
46:50 according to NASA no problem every
46:53 single time in fact if you go look up
46:55 the limb the lunar module on Wikipedia
46:59 it has this little scorecard off to the
47:00 right
47:02 fails zero lost zero perfect
47:07 utterly perfect well gee Hollywood is
47:10 pretty awesome isn't it it's like
47:12 watching a one of those Hollywood movies
47:14 where you know basketball team comes
47:16 from behind and takes over and wins the
47:18 championship even they don't write that
47:21 level of perfection in movies because
47:23 the audience would go [ __ ] right
47:26 NASA NASA so these astronauts are
47:34 sitting there and they're inside again
47:38 this compartment there's all these if
47:42 you look at the diagrams and the
47:43 cross-sections of it there's all these
47:45 circular things both at the level that
47:47 they're at and downstairs and that is
47:49 going to account for all the water that
47:51 they need to drink all the food they
47:53 need to eat all the waste products they
47:55 need to process and all the oxygen they
48:00 need to breathe again if you're a
48:03 deep-sea diver tell me how many things
48:06 you got to take to last 24 hours a day
48:11 for I think the last mission you know
48:14 being twelve and a half days I don't
48:17 know I mean how many days they're gonna
48:18 spend on the moon and me a couple days
48:19 to get there a couple days to get back
48:21 and so you subtract out you're talking
48:23 six to eight days of oxygen food I don't
48:27 really worry about too much but they're
48:30 in these spacesuits that are inflated
48:34 hmm well we have plenty of footage of
48:37 them testing out and water testing out
48:39 on land being on these sort of bungee
48:42 cord things to somehow simulate the
48:45 weightlessness on the moon they're
48:48 approximately three feet wide when this
48:50 thing is completely inflated and they
48:52 also have a hundred pound backpack that
48:54 supposedly has their oxygen supply for
48:56 whatever mission they're gonna do
48:57 outside the limbs capsule the limb
49:00 itself is again sitting on the surface
49:02 of the moon that if we use NASA's
49:05 official storyline when hit by the Sun
49:10 in the vacuum of space you can reach up
49:12 to 280 degrees Fahrenheit and in the
49:14 shadow you immediately draw up to 250
49:16 degrees below Fahrenheit below zero all
49:22 right how does how does anything survive
49:25 that differential and heat talking about
49:28 500 degrees swinging heat well I mean I
49:32 don't know about you I've sat in a car
49:34 and 114 degrees in Havasu with the air
49:37 conditioner attempting to keep me cool
49:39 I'm still sweating my ass off and it's
49:42 only 150 no 115 outside I'm sure that
49:46 the moon has got dry heat right but 280
49:49 let's just say 200 the amount of excited
49:53 particles hitting the the metal on the
49:54 outside yeah I'm sure there's some
49:56 theoretical insulation you could put in
49:58 there but reflecting all that agitation
50:02 away from the center living quarters
50:04 impossible one of you guys chimed in and
50:10 you're Effect 2 people have chimed in
50:12 who worked with air conditioning and but
50:15 there was a very vivid example someone
50:17 said they were tasked with cooling off a
50:20 room that was 160 degrees on average and
50:22 they said the amount of power that they
50:26 needed to do that
50:26 was horrendous we might have electricity
50:30 consumed to generate that
50:31 air-conditioning was horrendous okay but
50:37 they did it on the moon no problem with
50:39 battery technology mm-hmm I bet Elon
50:45 Musk would love to get a hold of the
50:47 battery
50:47 technology and the Apollo 11 so that you
50:50 know when you fill a whole chassis with
50:51 batteries from Apollo 11 you can drive
50:54 for [ __ ] 12 years without pulling
50:56 over to recharge in fact based on the
51:01 Apollo 11 lunar module Elon Musk could
51:05 create his own oxygen supply center in
51:09 the car too so you wouldn't have to
51:10 breathe pollution from outside filtered
51:12 through some filter nope you could have
51:14 your own atmosphere inside his cars if
51:17 you had just the technology from 1969
51:20 hell you don't even need the computers
51:22 that are four or five million times more
51:24 powerful than the computer in the Apollo
51:26 lunar module because they had rote
51:29 memory and men rote memory something
51:30 else boy I hope the absurdity of this
51:35 whole thing just starts to sink in and
51:37 sink in and sink in so I can't remember
51:40 what astronauts nephew went to the
51:44 museum in I believe Florida but he was
51:50 on video he was trying to film himself
51:53 examining the lunar module replicant
51:55 that was in the museum a one-to-one
51:57 replicant and he was VIP doll over the
52:01 place because he's the nephew of an
52:02 astronaut a living breathing moon
52:05 astronaut but he brought a little tiny
52:07 tape measure with him and when he set
52:09 out you mind if I measure the portal
52:12 door he was kicked out of the museum
52:15 immediately why why because that little
52:22 door is not wide enough to let an
52:24 astronaut in a space suit that's
52:25 inflated get out the door apparently my
52:29 show is so alluring that everyone wrecks
52:30 their car during every episode now
52:34 someone might offer some stupid theory
52:37 well they don't inflate do they get
52:38 outside there's not a single piece of
52:40 footage of an astronaut coming through
52:42 the portal door meaning part of their
52:45 bodies on the inside and part of their
52:46 bodies on the outside because they can't
52:48 fit through the door it's Hollywood man
52:52 if we had that problem on a Hollywood
52:54 set and any one of you had the naivete
52:58 to complain about such a thing the
53:00 director would look at you and
53:02 this is Hollywood man that just it's
53:05 just there as a prop but when you claim
53:11 150 billion dollars of development to
53:15 create this program taking it from
53:17 taxpayer dollars and again the limb was
53:21 21 billion dollars in development in
53:24 today's money about 2.2 billion in 1960s
53:28 money it's a lot of dough man it matters
53:34 it matters when they lie so again these
53:37 guys are climbing out their suits are
53:39 made of cloth and rubber a little bit of
53:41 metal for like supposedly these these
53:46 rubber seals that work in space right
53:48 rubber seal in the vacuum of space where
53:53 one side of the metal brace around the
53:56 around the helmet it's going to be 280
53:58 and the other half is going to be below
54:00 280 Fahrenheit you got a major major
54:03 problem with your o-ring that's keeping
54:05 these guys from dying from the outer
54:08 atmosphere leaking into their suit as
54:10 well I am unaware of any rubber cloth
54:16 suit that can withstand 280 degrees
54:19 fahrenheit for a moment's notice right
54:22 think about all these firefighters that
54:25 we just heard jumping into a fire and
54:28 they've got all kinds of fire retardant
54:31 materials on them yeah they can take a
54:34 burst of a flame for a really short
54:36 period of time
54:36 think about the formula 1 racers or
54:39 anyone who does racing there's different
54:41 grades of your suit to handle different
54:42 grades of fire based on different grades
54:45 of fuel I think the most expensive suits
54:49 you can buy as a from a friend of mine
54:51 who races Baja he told me the most
54:54 expensive suit you can buy gives you
54:55 about 10 seconds of fire before you're
54:58 going to start feeling it and start
55:01 suffering cellular damage right now 280
55:05 is not fire but I think 320 is the basic
55:08 fire our basic temperature required to
55:11 get a match to ignite it's fuel on the
55:13 end of the stick
55:14 all right so we're really hot man we are
55:18 SuperDuper hot and part of insulating
55:22 any body from an from a surface so that
55:27 you don't feel what's happening with the
55:29 surface is there has to be a little bit
55:32 of space between you and the surface
55:35 that is encountering this undeniable
55:36 heat and so you know like the Space
55:40 Shuttle tiles they're the ceramic tiles
55:42 on the outside of a hull that's pretty
55:44 damn thick and then there's you don't
55:46 sit with your your body up against the
55:49 hole so even the hole was a little bit
55:50 warm you know it's like the sr-71 pilots
55:53 has said the - the the capsule window is
55:57 so hot you could throw an egg at it and
55:58 it burns up completely before it hits
56:00 you in the lap but if they touch that
56:03 they're gonna be in a big big trouble so
56:06 what's the difference between wearing
56:08 the suit that is enduring these in brass
56:11 stick cold and heat levels remember
56:12 hypothermia starts around 60 degrees I
56:15 think of like 67 degrees right one of
56:18 our listeners chimed in and because I
56:21 think it's a he followed the testing of
56:28 these suits in the California desert and
56:32 they said that they were never able to
56:34 get these suits to work and that the
56:38 astronaut started passing out in these
56:40 suits in the desert they said the the
56:43 desert was about 135 but the suit
56:46 started to get doing getting up to about
56:48 a hundred and sixty degrees that's death
56:52 man that's complete and utter death and
56:56 just because the back might be negative
56:59 160 or negative 130 it doesn't fix the
57:02 problem inside you're a cook tag on one
57:05 side of your body and you're an icicle
57:07 on the back of your body and no 100
57:09 pound backpack has been developed to
57:11 provide oxygen that's just that's the
57:15 first thing that needs to exist on the
57:17 backpack of this thing is just a supply
57:19 of oxygen let alone an air conditioner
57:22 let alone the ability for this stuff to
57:25 get out to your fingertips
57:26 to your tip of your toes
57:28 the top of your head I mean the helmets
57:30 actually pretty suited for this but your
57:32 entire body you would need a distance of
57:37 some level even with space-age stuff
57:40 from the 21st century or the 24th
57:42 century you would need some distance
57:44 between just the suit and your flesh
57:46 otherwise this is going to cook you or
57:48 freeze you it just will if you look at
57:51 the gloves that they had their rubber
57:54 tip gloves look at the booties they put
57:56 on before they go out which creates the
57:58 little slats when they step on the moon
57:59 soil they have smooth leather seat heels
58:03 excuse me soles they go into these
58:05 grippy little boots okay what rubber
58:09 today can that can withstand days and
58:13 days and days of 280 degrees fahrenheit
58:16 without melting go try it
58:18 go take your oven throw it up to 280
58:20 degrees find some dense rubber and put
58:24 it in the oven and just let it sit for
58:26 hours and hours and hours and tell me
58:29 that you're gonna be not smelling a
58:31 house full of a toxic chemical that will
58:33 kill you in fact don't do that you'll
58:34 probably die it's only okay for
58:36 astronauts from the sixties all right
58:41 now for those of you that are really
58:43 intense enthusiasts and you're willing
58:45 to watch every single reel that nASA has
58:49 offered us claiming that they are a
58:52 videotaped astronauts on the moon you
58:56 need to go through 11 12 14 16 17 the
59:00 later missions started getting pretty
59:02 silly but you will find tons of gravity
59:07 anomalies tons of sound anomalies
59:09 there's a famous famous scene where I
59:12 believe it's Buzz but I could be wrong
59:15 here they are in the vacuum of space
59:17 meaning sound waves are never going to
59:19 travel because there's nothing to make
59:21 them travel now if someone walks up to
59:22 you in the vacuum of space and hits your
59:24 taps your helmet you're gonna hear it
59:27 because you have oxygen in your helmet
59:28 the concussion from outside will vibrate
59:30 and go into your ear and you'll hear
59:32 sound but there's a famous scene where
59:34 someone threw something away and it hit
59:38 the limb leg I believe is where it
59:41 impacted and you could hear it in the
59:44 microphone that means it made a big tick
59:48 noise and it went through the oxygenated
59:51 room / studio where this is all
59:53 occurring and you hear it inside the
59:55 spacesuit and there you go you're not on
59:57 the moon anymore you're in a studio so
60:00 some of you might be saying okay we'll
60:01 get to how they actually faked this
60:03 thing and again I got a whole episode
60:06 that's all about this how they faked it
60:08 but just really quickly they dropped the
60:12 limb down on the set with a crane which
60:16 is why the legs never have any scoot
60:18 which is what's been filmed out the
60:21 window they never have any dirt on them
60:23 and there you go it also doesn't have to
60:25 perform anything in the vacuum of space
60:27 it's just there
60:29 clean as a whistle right not that we get
60:32 a lot of dirt but the legs are gonna
60:33 definitely get filthy the astronauts are
60:37 on this set in fact it's not even the
60:39 astronauts in my opinion I think it's
60:41 agents actors pretending to be these
60:44 folks that's why they have a blast
60:46 shield in front of them that's covered
60:47 in gold the theory is that it reflects a
60:50 lot of the light from the Sun at the
60:54 same time anytime you reflect light away
60:55 from a surface you're talking about just
61:00 looking at the ground becomes difficult
61:01 you're looking through a welding mask of
61:03 some sort right but they are also on
61:07 wires okay old is the hill's man I don't
61:11 know when what the first stage
61:13 performance was in history where someone
61:15 was on a wire I would assume it's back
61:17 in the Greek Theatre days but they
61:19 realize that you know back in the 1800s
61:21 if you're on a black wire against a
61:23 black curtain it's a little harder to
61:25 see it if you keep the audience down
61:26 looking up but it's even better so what
61:29 do they do to make sure that we couldn't
61:31 see these black wires and there may be
61:33 footage where they don't actually use
61:35 the wires but I would personally guess
61:38 that they were on wires the entire time
61:41 what they get rid of all the stars
61:44 because the stars are one thing they
61:46 can't fake in a studio because why
61:50 well the studio is not a gigantic dome
61:53 it's a square box
61:55 if you're trying to paint the
61:57 perspective of how stars are painted in
62:00 space well you're gonna you're
62:02 definitely gonna see things vanish into
62:03 a flat plane turn a corner and come at
62:05 you it's gonna look awful so they use
62:08 the excuse that they couldn't see any
62:10 stars because the cameras were dialed in
62:14 to see this massively reflective ground
62:16 and therefore you can't see stars now in
62:19 most cases I would agree with them
62:21 that's true
62:21 couple things serious is a bright a star
62:25 in the space okay super bright bright a
62:28 star in the skies cuz I've been told
62:30 okay
62:31 that we can see the human eye from Earth
62:33 that might show up but - I think you owe
62:38 it to the American people in the world
62:40 that while you're there you just the
62:43 aperture of the camera and you keep it
62:45 from ever pointing at the moon's surface
62:48 right you keep it up and you do point it
62:50 at the stars and you go check this out
62:52 boom none of that none of that at all
62:55 now I used to say this someone has
62:59 circulated this footage and I don't
63:01 think it looks real personally but they
63:04 circulated this weird video of moon
63:08 coverage and it's it's making this claim
63:12 oh this is the footage that proves we
63:14 didn't go to the moon I watched it a
63:15 couple times I could figure out what the
63:17 hell they were talking about didn't have
63:18 time to reading articles around it I
63:20 think their wording articles around it
63:21 someone linking the video directly but
63:25 they did show someone filming on the
63:29 moon surface and then filming this half
63:31 moon thing of the earth far away and
63:34 it's pure white the big sort of gotcha
63:38 with being on the moon for six
63:40 successful missions is that using a
63:43 video camera constantly in this process
63:46 there is no clear shot I will say other
63:49 than this weird piece of footage which
63:51 looks fake but anyway of taking the
63:54 camera the video camera and turning it
63:56 and pointing it at the earth video it's
63:59 very important still photographs well
64:01 they razorblade negatives together and
64:03 take one shot of two negatives on top of
64:06 each other and that's how you get the
64:08 half marbles shot that you see but when
64:10 someone took that photo off NASA's
64:12 website from long time ago in the 90s
64:15 and hi Condit basically took it in
64:17 Photoshop and jacked up the contrast you
64:19 see this perfect rectangle around the
64:22 earth because it's been cut in from a
64:24 different negative it changes the
64:27 density of black when you do that and
64:30 therefore they saw the forgery in the
64:32 photograph and then you have this
64:35 hoppity-hop you know one-sixth gravity
64:39 jumping around the moon thing now it's
64:42 easy to take the equation and simply say
64:44 oh we just take the rate of fall I mean
64:47 we also diminish it by 1/6 and so you're
64:51 gonna have 1/6 speed on everything the
64:54 problem with that as we all know who are
64:56 on the inside of this whole thing is
64:58 that when you take any of the moon
64:59 footage where they appear to be hopping
65:02 around on the moon and floating for a
65:04 microsecond here and there and you crank
65:07 it to 2x the whole thing seems real-time
65:10 all of a sudden well for those of you
65:13 who want to try to debunk the whole
65:15 thing because I think you're not going
65:16 to have any of that floaty stuff you're
65:18 gonna weigh about 50 pounds roughly and
65:20 a child doesn't float because they weigh
65:22 50 pounds on earth the cat doesn't swim
65:25 around your house weighing less than 50
65:28 pounds you weigh 50 pounds that's it
65:31 rate of descent [ __ ] but whatever I
65:34 should have to take that footage and
65:37 crank it up 6x to see this then go
65:40 remotely real time in terms of the way
65:42 that things drop nope 2x does the trick
65:45 it's an old Hollywood thing it's called
65:48 over cranking the camera 24 frames a
65:51 second establishes motion in a movie
65:53 theater ok so you roll it at 48 frames
65:56 per second then you play it back at 24
65:59 frames per second and you have exactly
66:00 the effect that you see and all the
66:02 footage now for those of you who might
66:05 have been alive during this my co-host
66:09 from the other show said he remembered
66:11 it because he was like 9 years old when
66:14 it occurred he said that they kept
66:16 saying over and over and over again and
66:19 Apollo 11 Apollo 12
66:23 13:14 that this Saturn 5 rocket with its
66:27 Rocketdyne f1 Boosters down below was so
66:30 perfectly arranged internally that the
66:35 saying that he remembered was they
66:37 couldn't take up another paper clip
66:39 because it would off balance the rocket
66:42 and it would make it obviously that's an
66:45 exaggeration it's not a literal
66:47 statement for NASA but I'm sure that
66:48 that was said what they're talking about
66:51 is you can't bring up a lot of heavy
66:52 stuff in addition to everything else
66:54 they're bringing but by Apollo 15 they
66:57 bring up a 700-pound car okay so where
67:02 are the improvements what did you take
67:04 out of the rocket to to make this occur
67:07 the reason why they brought a car up in
67:10 Apollo 15 is again everyone's getting
67:13 bored as hell
67:14 think about the arc of interest in these
67:17 moon missions obviously 11 is a landmark
67:20 moment for mankind if everyone's
67:22 believing the hoax by 12 people were
67:25 calling in like bart sibrel said and
67:26 complaining that this was interfering
67:28 with their normal television programming
67:30 again the classical assic complaint was
67:32 I Love Lucy was the most popular
67:34 television show in America and they were
67:37 complaining that that was being wiped
67:39 off the network's to cover the spoon
67:42 stuff so they develop a little you know
67:47 tragedy which is the Apollo 13 there's
67:50 explosion outside the service module
67:52 it's never explained there's only one
67:55 paragraph and the official report trying
67:57 to allude to what might have occurred
67:58 but even that stays away from any
68:01 specifics because if there was something
68:04 that could explode on the outside at
68:06 such an early stage in the in the rocket
68:08 they would have to redesign the whole
68:10 service module if it was like well [ __ ]
68:13 we forgot there's this oxygen tube that
68:15 goes next to the power coupling and then
68:17 poof that gets a little too hot and
68:18 explodes nope so everyone is interested
68:23 in 14 because 13 almost you know and
68:28 according to the fake story they almost
68:31 died all of them so everyone's gonna
68:34 watch 14
68:35 probably still got bored by the time it
68:37 was over so now instead of waiting for
68:40 the public to get bored they inject a
68:44 new space thing right the moon buggy if
68:51 someone else uncovered this and I start
68:52 watching it and I got a lot of kudos for
68:55 my moon evidence video for putting this
68:58 in there but someone realized very
69:00 quickly that this moon buggy which is
69:04 based on a jeep chassis had a dummy in
69:07 it the entire time was it a human being
69:09 at no point in the moon buggy footage do
69:12 you have someone independently moving
69:14 now these guys were goofing off on the
69:18 moon to a degree that was ridiculous
69:20 again they were singing songs and
69:23 playing golf by Apollo 7 yeah the Apollo
69:26 17 mission they've done all kinds of
69:29 wild stuff so these guys aren't you know
69:33 there they would be giddy to be on the
69:35 moon wouldn't they I would be so you're
69:39 driving this car on the moon for the
69:40 first time peace man
69:43 hey mom how's it going hey buddy over
69:46 there I'm driving this car the way that
69:49 it was arranged was that one of the
69:51 dummy's hands was on the wheel the other
69:54 hands just sitting there
69:55 floating as this thing's bouncing around
69:57 right now you and I might drive in fact
70:00 almost all of you have ridden on an ATV
70:03 you've ridden on music park rides that
70:07 are very violent here and there and we
70:10 do something as human beings because
70:11 it's a natural thing for those have you
70:13 ever seen someone hold a chicken and it
70:16 starts staring at the video camera and
70:17 they move the body of the chicken but
70:19 the head just stays absolutely still all
70:21 birds do this and we do this as well you
70:26 correct with your muscle tissue to keep
70:29 from being thrown around inside of a
70:31 vehicle you're still gonna get thrown
70:32 around but you attempt to fight it and
70:35 you you would be very sore after writing
70:37 in one of those things because wanna you
70:39 know I'm sure that the suspension was
70:41 pretty raw even though the tires the
70:43 this this vehicle is ingenious I mean
70:45 whoever designed this thing was just
70:46 next-level thinking it was great
70:49 this whole thing is fairly next-level
70:51 thinking so there's again there's some
70:53 awards that we should give to people for
70:55 coming up with this and then there's
70:57 some gel cells that should have been
70:59 filled up a long time ago for other
71:00 people least of all the astronauts I
71:04 mean the astronauts were forced into
71:05 doing this okay but if you watch the
71:08 moon buggy footage it's a joke and then
71:11 we have folks that drive dune buggies in
71:13 the desert and they are very familiar
71:15 with the rooster tail that comes off the
71:18 back of tires in our gravity world
71:22 one-sixth gravity means that the plume
71:24 coming off the back of this thing would
71:26 have been a dirt road nightmare you
71:28 would be any of you've lived in the
71:30 Midwest you've driven down a dirt road
71:31 you can see someone coming from miles
71:34 away because you start to see that
71:35 Robbie the robot you know dirt trail
71:37 that comes off the back of the truck and
71:40 you know again it's one of those funny
71:42 things that you don't want to stop the
71:43 truck at a stop sign because you know
71:45 that clouds gonna roll over your truck
71:47 and you're gonna toll trucks gonna be
71:48 brown right not the problem with the
71:52 one-sixth gravity moon buggy and again
71:57 supposedly the surface of the Moon has
71:58 no water so this stuff would be the most
72:00 pure concentrated powder whatever the
72:04 hell the moon is made out of right but
72:06 again they ran it to X and all of a
72:08 sudden all the gravity is one one
72:09 gravity here on earth hmm big problem
72:14 now terms of the theory of bringing back
72:17 moon rocks that really isn't a problem
72:20 to be honest especially if you could fit
72:24 the Chrysler in the bottom they said I
72:27 believe the number is then all the
72:29 missions that went to the moon I think
72:30 the total number of rocks is about 600
72:33 pounds which means coming back at any
72:35 one point in time six successful
72:37 missions on average we'd have 100 pounds
72:39 of rocks coming back yeah you know
72:42 whatever I think that works if you had
72:46 one-sixth gravity you have these big
72:48 explosive bolts that blow that thing up
72:50 into the atmosphere
72:51 excuse me up into the higher altitudes
72:54 no atmosphere it's theoretical you could
72:57 do it you know all the moon rocks are
72:59 from Earth they they went
73:02 the South Pole and picked up a bunch of
73:04 rocks on the on the snow which are
73:08 probably meteorites of some sort so when
73:10 they studied the quantum frequency of
73:13 these rocks they do appear to be outside
73:16 this world but think oh look at all the
73:17 embalming tools that the Egyptians used
73:19 they took iron ore out of meteorites
73:22 melted it down and made all the
73:24 embalming equipment so you could look at
73:25 those tools and say wow these tools are
73:27 from outside the world these must be
73:29 aliens and all that stuff no it's just
73:32 just iron ore meteorites okay there's
73:34 clubs that go look for this stuff in the
73:36 desert all the time so for anyone denied
73:39 that exists you got a lot of explaining
73:41 to do right so what else is on the moon
73:44 it seems a little weird if all this is
73:46 still plausible for someone's brain well
73:52 one of the two astronauts has a
73:54 Hasselblad camera attached to their
73:57 chest with no ability to look down
73:59 through the viewfinder in fact there is
74:00 no viewfinder because it doesn't need to
74:02 be one yours truely grew up with
74:05 Hasselblad it's my entire life until I
74:07 left home so I've had a Hasselblad
74:10 in my hand as a child whenever I wanted
74:13 one and when my father he was a
74:14 professional photographer would take me
74:16 out on wedding shoots or whatever we
74:18 were shooting the back of the camera
74:22 comes off you had to put this little
74:24 little aluminum slider thing in there
74:28 and then you can pull the back off won't
74:31 expose the film because it's protected
74:32 by the slide that went in there and then
74:34 I've already got the new back with the
74:36 brand-new I think it's like 120 film or
74:41 whatever it's a huge square negative and
74:42 he just slides a new one on he doesn't
74:44 miss a beat I take the new one crank and
74:46 I'll pull out the film because it's now
74:49 inside the canister reload the new one
74:50 get it ready for when he comes back to
74:53 me okay Hasselblad czar delicate cameras
74:58 that when I was a kid the rumor was that
75:00 it takes a year to make one it's like a
75:02 Swiss watch okay but they don't they
75:06 don't give an astronaut the exact ones
75:08 that we have here on earth right if any
75:10 of you've seen it it's a pretty
75:12 metallized camera they take out all the
75:14 black
75:15 leather or plastic or anything that's
75:18 going to be unnecessary for decoration
75:20 reasons and they made the whole thing
75:21 out of metal now again 15 years ago I
75:24 watched an interview with the gentleman
75:26 that made the cameras that went to the
75:27 moon he's being interviewed by someone
75:31 who believes what we believe which is
75:33 the whole thing's a hoax they asked the
75:36 guy of the camera that you made special
75:38 for NASA all those cameras that you made
75:40 what would happen if you took the camera
75:43 and exposed it to 280 degrees Fahrenheit
75:45 and then suddenly slammed it down to 280
75:47 degrees below Fahrenheit below zero
75:49 Fahrenheit the dude had a beat in the
75:54 script where he just looked at the guys
75:55 like what and like yeah that's what
75:58 that's the environment that your cameras
76:00 were in and he said well they would
76:04 explode you know so they do that effect
76:06 a Hasselblad camera has the most amazing
76:10 precision and it was ice lenses I mean
76:12 it is a masterpiece like a same way most
76:15 cameras are pretty amazing devices right
76:17 but a lot of tender pieces inside that
76:20 have to flex really fast the shutters
76:22 got to go in and out super quick right
76:24 to expose the film to the perfect amount
76:28 of light through the aperture ESA
76:29 settings right if you started twisting
76:32 and turning any of that metal that
76:35 camera is not gonna work well not only
76:39 did the video cameras work but the
76:42 Hasselblad worked perfectly
76:44 now I've had people debate the following
76:47 thing with me and they're probably
76:49 talking about different missions but the
76:53 first articles I ever read on Neil
76:55 Armstrong this is when I was a believer
76:56 about using the Hasselblad camera
76:58 because I sort of felt special I had
76:59 hasa blogs in my life Hasselblad went to
77:01 the moon it's a cool thing they have
77:05 about 30 frames inside each one of the
77:07 rolls of film and I never heard about
77:11 Neil reloading the camera and shooting
77:15 multiple rolls of film someone recently
77:17 came into the commotion say recently
77:19 probably three years ago came into the
77:21 comments and said that Neil took several
77:23 rolls of film so maybe that's the case
77:26 I've been unable to verify that
77:30 but of the shots that Neal got they are
77:35 epic time-life cover photographs and he
77:41 had no ability to look through a
77:43 viewfinder on his chest to see if he was
77:45 actually framing the shot correctly the
77:48 excuse was that he was trained to be a
77:50 great photographer having grown up in
77:53 that realm myself okay and and seeing
77:56 out of all the shots that my father
77:58 would take by precisely looking down
78:00 into the viewfinder holding it there
78:02 still a boatload of shots you would
78:03 never use lighting didn't work out right
78:05 someone walk someone move something
78:08 happens right not for Neil Armstrong he
78:11 takes one class and he's the most
78:12 intuitive photographer on planet earth
78:14 and quite frankly instead of turning
78:17 into an alcoholic after he came back
78:19 from the moon missions because his soul
78:20 was probably rotting from lying about
78:22 this whole thing and having no option
78:23 otherwise he should have become a
78:27 professional photographer because
78:29 imagine Neil looking through the
78:31 viewfinder oh my god what could that guy
78:32 possibly do I mean he doesn't have to
78:34 even look and here's what's funny if I
78:36 explain this thing to someone in 1995
78:39 well what how'd you take a picture 1995
78:42 you'd say waiter buy some film
78:43 you got a steadier AAS a rating and
78:47 you're gonna take it and you got to go
78:48 take it down the fotomat and got it get
78:49 it developed and then you bring it back
78:51 Yatta Yatta Yatta and someone could
78:53 maybe believe back in 1995 that you
78:56 could just be told how to take a great
78:57 photograph and instantaneously your
78:59 genetics upgrade you have this massive
79:01 into intuition for lighting and all this
79:04 other stuff for those of you been on a
79:05 Hollywood set and I have been on a few
79:09 there's a reason why you sit around for
79:11 12 hours for your 4-minute take because
79:15 they are working on camera positioning
79:17 lighting taking all kinds of sample
79:19 shots to make sure the lighting is
79:21 perfect looking through previous
79:22 monitors to make sure it's all good make
79:24 sure it's all lined up perfectly the
79:26 shots that Neil Armstrong took were so
79:29 unbelievably perfect it boggles the mind
79:32 okay to suggest that a guy could do this
79:35 with a camera on his chest as I've said
79:38 in several episodes if I gave you such a
79:40 rig entitled to your chest
79:42 and said you couldn't look at anything
79:44 that you're doing but you have to go to
79:45 Disneyland and bring out ten time life
79:48 covers and I gave you infinite amount of
79:53 film it's a digital camera let's just
79:54 say infinite amount of memory or
79:56 whatever but you can't leave the park
79:58 until you get me ten time life shots
79:59 you're gonna be there for months if not
80:02 years trying to get ten shots no problem
80:05 for Neil Armstrong but again the first
80:08 thing I ever read was that how
80:10 astonishing it was that he was able to
80:11 do this with one roll of film
80:13 let's make any sense to me I think about
80:14 it but I definitely remember hearing
80:17 that claim and seeing the numbers in the
80:20 article don't know pretty amazing job he
80:25 did let's talk about radiation okay
80:28 radiation in space is very formidable
80:31 without a coronal mass ejection
80:33 radiation in space and the Van Allen
80:35 belts is most definitely so powerful
80:39 that if you took a bunch of human beings
80:40 and put him in a capsule
80:41 quarter-inch-thick you'd be frying these
80:43 folks like you know a peach in a
80:49 microwave for four days right they would
80:51 be so utterly dead and cooked to a crisp
80:54 they wouldn't exist to this day but if
80:57 you took film and exposed to radiation
81:00 and a camera made of aluminum which does
81:03 not shield against radiation you would
81:06 have the experiment that Madame Curie
81:08 the woman who really is credited with
81:11 discovering radiation from uranium bars
81:14 her experiment that led to the discovery
81:18 very quick story she was constantly
81:23 using film in her laboratory and man and
81:25 dealing with uranium bars on one night
81:28 she put a uranium bar on top of a
81:31 package of film in a in a desk drawer
81:34 closed it went away came back eventually
81:37 used that film and found out it was all
81:39 exposed right where the bar was because
81:41 radiation from the bar leaks to the
81:43 paper no problem and exposed to film so
81:46 all of Neil Armstrong's footage would
81:48 have been if not a hundred percent
81:50 probably a thousand percent overexposed
81:53 completely exposed when he got back to
81:56 earth
81:56 same with the video cameras even
81:59 modern-day video cameras that are using
82:01 it what is it LCDs sensors the analog to
82:06 digital conversion would have the same
82:09 exact problem for the same reason
82:11 astronauts saw shooting stars in their
82:13 eyes and 2019 98 when they went 40
82:17 percent the distance to the Van Allen
82:19 belts is the same reason why the film
82:21 would have been exposed same thing with
82:24 an LCD
82:25 it just feels concussion of light the
82:27 verb of light and it registers light you
82:30 just turn the camera on its immediately
82:32 white it's immediately overexposed I
82:34 don't know maybe you walked behind a
82:35 rock where there's a shadow and all of a
82:36 sudden you could see something in it
82:38 because being blocked by the rock don't
82:42 know now bart sibrel mentions this
82:45 several times and I don't I don't go for
82:47 this but this is his go-to thing so what
82:49 I mentioning here his big piece of
82:53 evidence is that the shadows on the moon
82:55 converge and they could verge violently
82:58 not casually so you will have a shot of
83:02 the limb in sunlight for those of you
83:08 are good with Photoshop you'll take any
83:10 one of the moon photographs and you hike
83:11 on any shot and you start seeing hot
83:16 spots well I'm in a backyard right now
83:19 and there's no hot spots of any kind
83:22 except maybe on my forehead right here
83:24 but without shadows you don't get hot
83:27 spots because the Sun is far enough away
83:30 however far that is and it creates
83:32 uniform light wherever there's daytime
83:34 even when it's dusk its uniform dusk you
83:37 don't get hot spots hot spots are
83:39 created by what ask anybody in Hollywood
83:41 is a grip spotlights cause hot spots and
83:45 they are something that Hollywood fights
83:46 every single day I mean today today
83:49 alone during the course of me shooting
83:51 this episode I'm going to wager that
83:53 there's been 500 sets somewhere in the
83:56 world from Bollywood to Hollywood where
83:58 people are trying to get rid of hot
83:59 spots hot spots on actors faces hot
84:02 spots on the ground because they're
84:03 trying to simulate light that's natural
84:04 and they're using spotlights to do it so
84:07 the only way you can do it has
84:08 introduced more and
84:09 or lights I believe it was a cinema
84:12 Tyler guy that said that maybe even
84:14 Vivian Kubrick told me this that inside
84:17 the room at the Overlook Hotel and The
84:20 Shining where Jack is typing on the you
84:22 know typewriter all work and no play
84:25 makes Jack a dull boy the number is
84:28 close to 800 lights in that room which
84:32 sounds ridiculous but they said the room
84:34 was so hot that they would have to turn
84:37 on all the lights get the shots done
84:39 quick and then turn them off because
84:41 everybody was getting just heat stroke
84:43 in the room that's how important it is
84:46 to distribute light in normal Hollywood
84:49 but they didn't do that because they
84:51 knew they had a singular light issue
84:52 with the Sun so there's been some
84:54 theories that they put giant arrays of
84:58 light bulbs together to create this
84:59 giant impression of the Sun but Bart has
85:03 some very convincing footage of again
85:05 rocks that have 90 degree shadows with
85:08 the foreground objects going straight
85:10 out so they converge at a 90 degree
85:13 angle just 100 feet out now the excuse
85:17 for that is that the moon surface is not
85:22 uniform in its ups and downs and so you
85:25 could get some of those weird shadows I
85:27 don't think that remotely addresses the
85:29 issue you would simply have the shows
85:32 going in that direction perhaps being a
85:35 little bit off in vector but definitely
85:36 not a 90 degree turn and there's tons of
85:38 photographs that reveal this I once
85:41 showed the famous picture of Buzz Aldrin
85:43 coming down the ladder which Nvidia did
85:45 a pathetic [ __ ] attempt to try and
85:47 diss their try to debunk and again the
85:50 photo that they have in their simulation
85:52 online and the gates what we're seeing
85:54 in the photograph so they just erase the
85:56 evidence and said look it's it's Buzz
85:58 coming down a thing and it's just
85:59 reflective light off the surface of the
86:01 of the moon but the idea is that buzz is
86:05 coming down the back of the limb on a
86:07 ladder in the shadows but he's fully lit
86:09 and he has hot spots on his cloth of his
86:12 leg he's got hot spots on the rubber
86:14 seal of his foot and the whole thing's
86:16 lit the whole thing is lit beautifully
86:18 and again of course Neil Armstrong gets
86:20 a time-life cover
86:23 with one try it's beautiful right no
86:25 coverage for Neal man he just boom
86:27 perfection boom perfection right but I
86:31 showed that picture to a friend of mine
86:33 who worked for Blizzard Entertainment he
86:36 was one of the most senior guys in their
86:38 cinematics department when they were
86:39 booming I showed it to him in 2014 he
86:43 had never considered for a for a second
86:45 that the moon missions weren't really
86:47 just doesn't care which I think is funny
86:50 and he looked at the shot and he goes
86:52 he's listening to me tell him you know
86:54 that things aren't real and he just says
86:56 well I can tell you right now I can see
86:58 with my eye five different light sources
87:01 for this shot and I said really unique
87:04 goes yeah he was there there there that
87:06 he saw a bunch of stuff I didn't see
87:07 because Blizzard Entertainment's in
87:10 cinematics group back in the day
87:12 or the best digital eyes on planet Earth
87:16 these guys learned how photons fly
87:19 around environments that's what they do
87:21 they have a term internally they call
87:24 pixel [ __ ] which is that they will
87:26 take five seconds of footage and mull
87:28 over for six weeks to make sure it's
87:30 absolutely pixel perfect now I've got
87:34 plenty guys in Hollywood that have big
87:36 gold statues that have told me the same
87:38 exact thing or some variation thereof
87:40 that once they had someone crack it in
87:43 their brain oh yeah this thing could be
87:45 fake and yeah that doesn't make any
87:47 sense and that uh they came back to me
87:50 and over drinks they just simply shook
87:52 their head you know they're in their 70s
87:54 and 60s and they're like I can't believe
87:56 I believe this was real for all that
87:57 time unbelievable now there's some
88:02 footage out there that's kind of
88:03 interesting that we're gonna wrap this
88:04 up before we take off back to the earth
88:07 that you know because we are discovering
88:13 this is a fake some people have created
88:16 bogus footage of you know lights falling
88:20 down from the ceiling and astronauts
88:22 going on what the hell man you know
88:23 they've created deliberate fakes to
88:26 create disinformation so that you
88:29 believe that people are faking some of
88:31 this stuff but everything I've told you
88:32 so far is just straight up use your
88:34 brain you're gonna be on top of the
88:36 real story I believe it was 1516 years
88:40 17 somewhere in there there's this piece
88:42 of footage which shows a worker on the
88:47 set picking up a piece of trash and
88:49 taking it off the set and he's obviously
88:52 just the pedestrian clothing and he
88:54 walks off set someone said that they
88:57 faked that shot I would say that they
89:00 did a brilliant job because they created
89:01 a government real that still had the
89:04 shadow in the shot and someone took
89:07 advantage of that shadow to put a guy in
89:08 there whether or not that's true or not
89:09 I would say you don't need any of that
89:11 sort of stuff to convince yourself that
89:14 this is not possible for all the reasons
89:17 cited in this episode now the other one
89:20 is the I just want to mention quickly to
89:22 kind of maybe put in a maybe I have been
89:27 citing for all the episodes that I get
89:29 into this
89:30 the sheath this seems to be underneath
89:33 the limb right after they land in Apollo
89:35 11 it was billed as a sheath around the
89:39 10,000 pound thrust motor which is then
89:41 blown off as it's doing its landing and
89:44 it happens to be run underneath the limb
89:47 unburned no dirt on it and of course it
89:50 would have come off miles away and so
89:52 what is it doing underneath the limb
89:54 someone recently posted that they they
89:56 were told that that was a bag of rubbish
89:59 now I just did a deep dive into the limb
90:02 and looked at a ton of photographs there
90:05 are apparently I saw one photograph
90:08 which looks like a bag of rubbish and it
90:11 is a big bag of garbage it's there not a
90:14 little tiny you know shower cap looking
90:18 thing so I don't know about that
90:19 particular thing but now there's a lot
90:22 of other things you know there's the the
90:24 rock with the letter C on it NASA said
90:27 it was a hair on the negative someone
90:31 reminded me if there was a hair on the
90:32 negative the hair would have been white
90:33 and not black it does kind of look like
90:36 a hair the little fold and what we
90:39 thought was a paper mache rock
90:41 which indeed it might be a paper mache
90:43 rock it might be a real rock who cares
90:44 that little fold isn't a fold at all
90:48 that has a shadow of an antenna that
90:51 actually touched the edge of the rock so
90:52 once you relocate that photograph you'll
90:55 start seeing the shadow and you start
90:56 realizing we were wrong about that being
90:58 a fold in the rock so again we've had
91:00 things pushed up there we're eager to
91:02 find out what proves this right or wrong
91:04 and so sometimes we do fall for
91:07 disinformation or just a bad
91:08 interpretation of stuff so brace
91:10 yourself when you do start looking at
91:12 stuff that's why I'm going at sort of
91:13 the core Sciences of what their claims
91:16 are so that we can nip this in the bud
91:20 way ahead of time before we get to those
91:21 sort of fringy pieces of potential
91:25 evidence or not so there they complete
91:29 the mission but whatever one you want to
91:32 pick I got to get back inside the
91:34 vehicle being three feet wide with a
91:36 two-foot door fail well let's just say
91:39 there's some spongy attribute to this
91:42 whole thing now this thing has to take
91:45 off and rendezvous with the service
91:47 module going in orbit some poor guy up
91:50 there didn't get to go to the moon
91:51 surface that must really suck you know
91:53 maybe you fear dying if you were really
91:55 gonna do it see thank your lucky stars
91:57 but again this whole thing is fake
91:58 anyway as I've been told it's a it's an
92:02 explosive that's underneath the top part
92:04 of the limb blows it into space there's
92:07 that famous shot of it doing it and the
92:09 camera that tracks it up now a lot of
92:11 folks said you know how could that have
92:14 happened because who would have operated
92:16 the camera I've heard ludicrous stories
92:19 about the fact the cameras actually
92:20 being controlled from Houston and the
92:26 more realistic explanation was it's just
92:29 timed because they understand I mean
92:32 they kind of would understand how fast
92:34 things going to go up and you just send
92:36 a signal out to the camera with this
92:39 automated rotation thing and you say
92:41 look you start rotating split second
92:44 after the signal comes to you because
92:46 we're gonna blow this thing up and there
92:47 you got your footage but how they get
92:48 that footage back down to earth I have
92:51 no idea
92:52 you can't transmit it come on what did
92:54 you
92:54 leave a giant broadcasting array up
92:56 there and the power to do it own
92:59 speaking of delays President Nixon did a
93:02 phone call with the astronauts and the
93:04 delays required to have that
93:06 conversation are absolutely not in the
93:08 conversation so they kind of started off
93:10 okay and then they started going too
93:12 quickly and replying too fast to him
93:14 again it's a two to three second delay
93:16 just to get a signal perfectly broadcast
93:18 between the moon and the earth
93:19 supposedly how much power it takes to do
93:22 that someone in broadcasting might let
93:23 me know but then it's got to travel all
93:26 the wires on earth and get to the White
93:28 House and he's got to figure out what
93:29 he's gonna say and he says it back and
93:31 then it's going to be the whole thing
93:32 back the other way and someone else has
93:34 to figure out what they're gonna say you
93:36 see this on earth in 2019 I just saw an
93:40 interview with someone it was a
93:41 different part of the world think it was
93:42 someone in the East Coast of America
93:44 interviewing someone in the Middle East
93:46 about something like was the Iranian
93:48 drone attack or whatever it was and they
93:50 were having a hard time keeping this
93:53 conversation and sink a lot of waiting
93:55 you know we know what's going on so we
93:57 have patience for the wait but my god
93:59 going to the moon in 69 that
94:00 conversation coming back that
94:02 conversation with Nixon would have been
94:04 a mess had it even been possible so if
94:07 you want to see a laughable reveal of
94:10 the fakery there you go now you know
94:12 what it started to happen is that is
94:15 such a screw-up on their part that they
94:18 floated this story that Nixon did fake
94:20 that conversation that was a hundred
94:23 percent fake in fact there's bodies of
94:26 scientists that will say well Apollo 11
94:30 was faked the whole thing was fake but
94:32 all the other missions were real what
94:34 are the hell they look exactly the same
94:35 then you know what are the what did the
94:38 astronauts go out and dust off the legs
94:40 for the other five missions to make sure
94:42 it was a [ __ ] and span is the first one
94:43 Yeah right obviously I'm overlooking a
94:47 tremendous number of things I've got
94:50 other episodes go to deep thoughts radio
94:51 comm click on NASA moon missions moon
94:54 hoax or whatever in the categories list
94:56 and you'll find all the episodes that go
94:58 into meticulous detail with video
94:59 reference while you watch for those on
95:02 podcasts here they are
95:06 okay they are blasting off from the
95:11 surface of the Moon with an explosive
95:13 which is going to be as arbitrary as
95:15 possible right you don't get there's
95:18 there's little retro cones again on the
95:20 outside but again if you're off a single
95:23 degree or a fraction of a single degree
95:26 you are not going to make your
95:28 rendezvous with the service module you
95:30 just won't
95:31 and yet this thing worked perfect six
95:34 times and here's the thing ask a fighter
95:38 pilot if the very first thing they do is
95:41 become a Top Gun pilot first mission out
95:43 man you get in that plane you've read
95:44 all the books you just hop behind the
95:46 cockpit and you go off to war and you
95:49 fight a Top Gun attack first mission
95:53 he'll know you've got a ride-along you
95:56 don't get to touch the stick for a long
95:58 time you practice all little tiny planes
96:00 you build yourself up to a big you know
96:02 50 million dollar you know fighter jet
96:06 well none of these astronauts could have
96:09 ever ever practiced the rendezvous to go
96:14 down to the moon surface land safely and
96:17 come back up and rendezvous with the
96:18 service module no practice at all but
96:21 perfect every single time ridiculously
96:24 perfect if they wanted to inject some
96:27 some Apollo 13 almost everyone died
96:30 moments they should have synthesized
96:32 something with that particular
96:33 rendezvous where one of them took you
96:35 know an extra half day to get it to work
96:38 and it was you know they had to fart out
96:40 a window to get the proper push
96:41 something like that right no perfect
96:44 every time
96:45 here come the astronauts through the
96:47 little little hole there into the
96:50 service module capsule and then of
96:53 course they cut the limb top part loose
96:55 to just I guess crash back down on the
96:58 planet of the moon which again pollutes
97:01 the surface of the Moon which we're not
97:03 supposed to do to our greatest extent so
97:08 then that big booster on the back which
97:10 is how all this all this already I
97:15 should say it's already been used to
97:17 escape the Earth's gravity
97:20 it's already been used to get in orbit
97:22 around the moon and it still has still
97:24 has plenty of fuel to escape the moon's
97:28 gravity and get back to earth and how
97:31 would that work let's say you could pull
97:34 it off you can't but let's say you could
97:37 hear you are screaming at the surface of
97:39 the earth and you've got to do another
97:41 slingshot thing which means you're first
97:44 orbit is gonna be really oblong and long
97:47 and then you're gonna continually
97:49 descend down to the point where now
97:51 you've totally stabilized low orbit
97:54 again Norbit means you're going in the
97:56 Van Allen belts out of the van elbows in
97:58 the venom of a lava it's just it's just
98:00 the most absurd assertion of science you
98:03 have ever heard in your life okay well
98:07 let's just say magic happens right NASA
98:09 magic happens
98:11 supposedly perfected in Apollo 8 okay
98:15 well they're gonna jettison the back of
98:17 this service module with the the motor
98:19 on it the thing that looks just like the
98:22 excursion to the moon from 1908 now you
98:25 got this capsule three guys inside
98:29 there's a couple things are gonna happen
98:31 you got this blast shield on the bottom
98:33 because you're gonna come in completely
98:36 non-intuitive to the shape of this
98:37 object the bottom first any of you know
98:40 how to shoot guns how many times you've
98:41 read the bullet turn around and the butt
98:45 hits the target not the not the pointy
98:47 piece I'd never go look at all these
98:50 project Aurora ships that the Russians
98:53 have we have it's all bullet shaped and
98:55 it flies in the path of the bullet
98:58 because the path of least resistance
98:59 you're starting to hit atmosphere that's
99:02 a natural shape to cut atmosphere out of
99:06 the way and it's so delicate ask a sr-71
99:10 pilot a B 1 or B 2 or B 2 e or whatever
99:13 the new one is if they make so much as a
99:18 correction that's too intense that the
99:20 computer wasn't helping them fly
99:21 basically they ripped the ship apart
99:23 guess it start tumbling and everybody
99:25 would die the ship of just disintegrates
99:28 ok so we have a bullet shaped object
99:34 coming into the atmosphere but first now
99:41 how many of you have done this you have
99:45 taken one of those medicine ball or not
99:47 well there's exercise balls right and
99:50 you try to sit on it and it's sort of
99:53 wobbly right because you're trying to
99:54 put your center of gravity on this ball
99:58 there's even folks that put like square
100:01 planks on the ball and they step on them
100:03 this is like a circus trick and they're
100:06 wobbling and wobbling and wobbling
100:08 because it's rough okay so you have the
100:11 butt of this bullet shaped object
100:12 hitting this variable density atmosphere
100:15 at an incredible amount of speed
100:18 according to the books well the
100:21 atmosphere isn't perfectly uniform and
100:24 it's push back against the capsule and
100:26 three guys inside also have an issue
100:30 that they're not the same weight and
100:33 stuffs not perfectly distributed inside
100:34 this thing so the force pushing down
100:36 isn't uniform either I've said this
100:40 several times but I saw an animation
100:42 than a guy I believe from Caltech did
100:44 where he simulated this simulate the
100:47 atmosphere in engineering software in
100:49 every single time he tried to make that
100:51 bullet shape object come in on its butt
100:53 it immediately turned and started
100:55 flipping so violently obviously that the
100:59 astronauts inside would be utter human
101:02 scrambled eggs would be it'd be horrific
101:06 somehow you see the footage they landed
101:10 with the three parachutes the parachutes
101:12 that are the size of your freaking house
101:13 each one of them right that's almost not
101:16 an exaggeration folks but where they
101:19 keep the parachutes hmm I just wouldn't
101:22 looked it up they say it's inside this
101:25 inner cone
101:28 such that when they crawl through that
101:30 little aperture to get to the lunar
101:32 module there's an inner cone inside that
101:34 and the parachutes sort of tucked in
101:36 there one of our listeners one often did
101:37 a deep dive on this and he said that he
101:39 was officially told that the parachutes
101:41 were packed again to the density of the
101:44 bark on a tree okay how many of you've
101:48 seen those funny videos online I guess
101:50 they're funny where someone tricks their
101:52 friends to sit on a airbag and then they
101:56 pop it and the guy flies 15 feet in the
101:58 air and probably breaks his [ __ ] back
101:59 and ruptures discs so funny but they do
102:04 that they took a person to sit on a sofa
102:05 boom without those concussion chutes
102:12 they're not parachutes but they're
102:13 definitely something that needs to
102:14 inflate quickly have a powder in them
102:17 that explodes and that's how that thing
102:19 unravels super fast before your face
102:21 plants decide the steering wheel or a
102:25 dashboard or whatever a parachute packed
102:30 as dense as bark would simply come out
102:33 and be this solid thing there is no way
102:37 to put a little parachute attached to
102:39 the big parachute and have a go to teach
102:40 in unravel not even at supersonic speeds
102:45 would you be able to she can't pull a
102:46 parachute out at supersonic speeds it
102:48 would just rupture and a hint kill
102:50 everybody inside by the violent ride and
102:53 shock wave that would happen to your
102:54 body so how do they do this this is
102:58 where it becomes a bit of a mystery even
102:59 to myself
103:00 I believe the astronauts went to low
103:03 orbit sets out there the entire time all
103:05 the tunic and things the Buzz Aldrin was
103:07 doing it's all no orbit nobody kind of
103:10 gets some folly gravity could be a vomit
103:13 rocket you can get a 747 you go way up
103:16 in the air and you dive down to the
103:19 ground you got 60 seconds to play around
103:21 with the tuna can maybe seems like they
103:25 were faking shots of the earth using the
103:27 portal window go see a funny thing
103:30 happened on the way to the moon you got
103:31 to see that movie if you're slightly
103:33 interested in this and you haven't seen
103:34 that movie and you haven't seen
103:35 astronauts gone wild you're doing
103:39 yourself a disfavored bart sibrel has
103:41 done the
103:42 old a big card of justice and making
103:45 both those films I own both of them he
103:48 signs them it's cool put you out 70
103:50 bucks but you're gonna be supporting
103:52 that dude that kind of led us down a
103:54 path that we needed to go so the
103:57 alternate theory is that this thing is
103:59 pushed out the back of a jumbo jet the
104:01 shoots are there they automatically in
104:03 you know catch the wind and now they
104:05 splash land in the ocean now if you're
104:09 200 miles up maybe these parachutes are
104:12 not just inside this little capsule
104:15 thing that could be outside they could
104:17 be ugly you don't get to see in the
104:18 first place
104:19 but do they come they scream down again
104:23 don't understand the blast plate thing
104:25 there's also this mysterious blackout
104:28 zone that ends up occurring which they
104:29 blame on atmospheric conditions the
104:33 thermal radiation on the outside the
104:34 ship can't get signals through it I
104:36 think that's probably been invented to
104:39 switch feeds from non top-secret feeds
104:44 to super top-secret feeds where these
104:46 astronauts can follow their script
104:49 Bart super Al's movie a funny thing
104:51 happened in the way of the moon he not
104:53 only shows you the footage that they
104:54 faked of the moon
104:56 excuse me faked of the earth in reverse
104:59 chronological order using a window but
105:01 he also reveals the fact that in one of
105:03 the conversations with the armstrong
105:04 doing this fake shot there seems to be a
105:08 third voice on the track which doesn't
105:10 have any distortion which tells them to
105:11 talk and it's huge it's a huge reveal
105:16 they're trying to guide the astronauts
105:19 to how the four second delay that they
105:21 need to keep up the illusion that
105:23 they're traveling in space going towards
105:25 the moon
105:27 now we did it we're back on back on the
105:32 ocean surface they're getting picked up
105:34 by the Navy heroes ticker tape parades
105:37 all that good stuff going on I always
105:40 like to bumper these episodes at the
105:42 very end with a little bit of lucidity
105:44 about the moment it's a repetition
105:47 between episodes but it's something I
105:49 think that we need to think about
105:50 because I definitely run into people
105:52 that are extremely angry at especially
105:54 the astronauts for hanging on to the
105:56 deception that would appear that Buzz
105:58 Aldrin just told ant year-old girl that
106:00 they didn't go to the moon that's pretty
106:02 interesting he seems to be losing it he
106:04 has lost it two or three times in the
106:06 past admitting that they didn't go one
106:09 of the most famous ones I can't find
106:10 anymore which is him taking an interview
106:12 with some news channel late at night and
106:14 he says the words and a bunch of you've
106:17 seen this and you've commented on this
106:19 supposedly in a gerund ISM videos so for
106:21 anyone to do me a huge favor find the
106:23 journalism video with this in there but
106:25 Buzz Aldrin says live on television
106:28 because they're asking him about getting
106:30 to Mars
106:31 he said well once we figure out how to
106:33 go to the moon it'll be a lot easier to
106:34 get to Mars there's a beat in the script
106:37 the guys on the other side is a woman
106:39 and a man looking at and they go well
106:40 what do you mean and they said he was
106:44 tired all right well I don't know any
106:47 other word you could substitute in his
106:50 sentence besides the moon okay they
106:53 would have tried the Rovers on Mars on
106:55 the moon had they really gone you're
106:58 gonna try the nearest body with your
106:59 brand-new invention here we've got all
107:01 these Rovers supposedly from India and
107:03 China and Israel tried it just recently
107:06 I think the astronauts have been
107:09 threatened to a degree that in the 60s
107:13 and 70s anybody would have responded to
107:17 this plus some of the guys will enjoy
107:19 the rest of the life being heroes that
107:21 went to the moon makes sense problem Gus
107:25 Grissom and his other two buddies were
107:26 murdered in Apollo 1 because he said
107:28 this thing could go to the moon they had
107:30 to get rid of the guy he wasn't gonna
107:31 lie boom death murder crime what's the
107:36 whole moon mission thing about the
107:37 things probably got several objectives
107:39 inspiring
107:40 the world to get into technology which
107:42 worked to bankrupt the Soviet Union and
107:45 to to develop the most superior
107:48 miniaturized intercontinental ballistic
107:50 missiles that could be fit in a trident
107:52 submarine its military I mean think
107:56 about it we just had this Cuban crisis
107:57 in 63 where Khrushchev is putting
108:01 missiles in Cuba going and we're gonna
108:02 bomb you guys and so internally they're
108:04 like okay let's say we're going to the
108:06 moon right away and just do whatever it
108:09 takes to get the money funneled into the
108:11 right black projects to get this thing
108:12 done rocket engines matter everything
108:15 matters
108:16 everything is usable it's a v3 rocket
108:20 program if you will why is this
108:22 important in 2019 well it is probably
108:25 the softest conspiracy you can get
108:27 yourself involved in which reveals how
108:29 the world really works the fact that
108:32 it's still being covered up today shows
108:33 you that the corruption continues to
108:35 live as I always say this whole thing is
108:39 out of sight out of mind as soon as the
108:41 Saturn 5 leaves your sight it's all
108:44 Hollywood and that's the way all that
108:46 stuff works
108:47 SpaceX launching a Tesla Rover into
108:51 space all Hollywood all fake Elon Musk I
108:54 don't know I think the guy is a very
108:57 bright man I think he knows he's being
108:59 controlled by a deep state and I think
109:01 he's trying to break free of the whole
109:02 thing good luck you can expect him to
109:05 have some accident at some point his
109:07 life my call out to him would be you get
109:12 to a very safe place and spill your guts
109:13 on live television
109:14 somewhere live internet feed or
109:16 something tell the world that you think
109:18 they're gonna kill you because you said
109:20 what you said and then stay in the
109:21 public eye the entire time reveal all in
109:23 the first day so then the only thing
109:25 will happen to you would be a punishment
109:26 arc and not a you got more to reveal
109:30 Park right anyway I hope you guys
109:34 enjoyed that this will be the final
109:37 episode on the moon probably this season
109:40 to be honest because I don't know where
109:41 else I could take it if something else
109:43 reveals itself we'll get into it now we
109:45 will continue most likely covering Mars
109:48 developments other Rover developments
109:50 Space Station developments throughout
109:53 the episode there's going to
109:54 more material coming in this in this
109:55 genre but if any of you could think of
109:57 something I haven't covered that could
109:58 last an hour I'm all ears but I don't
110:01 want to keep repeating myself because
110:02 it's already getting kind of nauseous
110:03 for me to continue doing this over and
110:06 over and over again but I think we
110:08 revealed in the last two episodes some
110:10 new stuff or some clarifications albeit
110:15 small but if you have them into deep
110:17 thoughts radio.com please go that's
110:19 where everything is - video - audio -
110:22 social media mainly the discussions in
110:25 our LOC Facebook group definitely come
110:26 in when you sign up definitely answer
110:28 the question
110:29 say something human are you gonna get
110:30 banned I blocked two or three folks
110:33 because I went to their page and they're
110:35 selling things so they want to lure you
110:37 into their hey buy this now things like
110:40 no thanks if you want to be legitimately
110:42 in this group you need to have a clean
110:43 profile page or just say something human
110:46 I'll let you through I need to know that
110:48 you're real you don't need any more
110:49 trolls on our situation all
110:51 subscriptions have almost halted YouTube
110:56 subscriptions we got a little bit of a
110:57 bump this last week but if I can get ten
111:01 of my friends to join YouTube will take
111:03 away eight it's just that way and
111:05 sometimes to take away like 15 Facebook
111:07 we've only had a couple requests to join
111:10 that group in my gosh in the last six
111:13 months it used to be several a week now
111:17 it's just it's just nothing so the
111:19 shadow banning is definitely real you
111:21 need to know that every single video I
111:22 post gets demonetized
111:24 immediately and then I have to petition
111:26 and then they all get granted
111:29 monetization so that's where we are
111:33 right now with the website you have all
111:36 the episodes plus a remastered season
111:38 one so if you go to this channel you try
111:40 to find season one it's not there go to
111:42 the website click season 1 it's a whole
111:43 different channel and the main reason
111:45 why I did that is it took me a year to
111:47 remaster everything and I didn't want to
111:49 have low number digits
111:52 throwing off the count of this channel
111:55 so I created a separate channel so it's
111:56 all there there won't be any more videos
111:57 attached to it but just make it easy on
111:59 yourself kick off from deep thoughts
112:02 radio calm and you'll always find the
112:03 right episode that I want you to see if
112:05 you want to hear how the episodes were
112:07 originally
112:07 prepared you can listen to the podcast
112:09 version of the original episodes but
112:11 most podcast software doesn't allow you
112:12 to go back 400 entries so we'll stop
112:15 around 300 they have to draw a limit at
112:17 some point right anyway till the next
112:21 episode take care of yourself and
112:22 someone else and I'll see in the next
112:23 deep thoughts over now
