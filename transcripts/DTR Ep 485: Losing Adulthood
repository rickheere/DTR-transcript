00:28 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today I'm going to rerecord an
00:35 episode that I had recorded once before
00:38 and I realized in the middle of it I got
00:44 through it it probably wasn't the worst
00:46 thing I just felt like I hadn't sorted
00:50 out my thoughts first and so then I went
00:52 ahead went ahead and had some
00:55 conversations with some extremely close
00:58 friends of mine of which I know their
01:03 opinions are very seasoned and I could
01:09 trust you know sort of their instincts
01:11 and as you can see this is called losing
01:14 adulthood there's several ways I can
01:17 start this out but I just want to get
01:20 right to the point really really quickly
01:22 it used to be that becoming an adult was
01:25 something that you looked forward to and
01:29 sadly it has been translated incorrectly
01:34 to simply getting old
01:36 having years on your driver's license
01:42 may be a wrinkle maybe a gray hair
01:45 maybe so many kids so many grandkids
01:49 somebody bills so much debt but it
01:54 seldom ever ever in the 21st century
01:58 gets equated to a level of maturity of
02:01 behavior and I will say that the current
02:07 you know Korona thing has really
02:11 revealed in my own personal circles
02:13 those who are mature and those who are
02:16 extremely immature and really it doesn't
02:21 have any correlation with age and we
02:24 know there's a bit of that in all cases
02:28 in all timeframes right it's always been
02:30 that way there's always someone you know
02:32 who's older who's acting like a child
02:33 and some ways a child is acting older
02:36 but what I'm talking about is you know
02:38 when I grew up it wasn't hard to find
02:42 adults it just happened
02:45 you know in fact it happened a lot
02:47 earlier than it does right now but as
02:51 well you know the the the vanity of
02:56 staying physically younger gets more and
03:00 more absurd with time I think we did
03:03 just come out of a really crazy phase
03:05 where during the 80s and 90s women got
03:08 you know implants of silicone which then
03:12 caused massive damage to their bodies if
03:15 they ever had a rupture and all they use
03:17 saline and that sort of thing but you
03:19 know the the boat X the Botox shots the
03:22 lip injections the plastic surgery comes
03:26 and goes I think we're sort of on a down
03:28 a downward curve on that Botox can I
03:34 think be done by some folks at a I don't
03:38 know a more casual state such that you
03:42 can do it and look very very normal
03:44 some folks go nuts with it and they just
03:46 clog zombies but the permanent damage
03:49 you know butt implants these guys
03:52 getting PEC implants the guys in Russia
03:54 injecting their arms with I don't even
03:57 know what what thing I forgot what it is
03:59 but you know physically destroying their
04:02 bodies to the point where you know
04:05 they're there yeah I have to have their
04:07 arms amputated I mean it's just insane
04:11 and I think it's because we get so
04:16 inundated with other people's opinions
04:19 about what we're supposed to be that we
04:23 lose track of ourselves completely you
04:27 know it's almost like you're standing in
04:28 a subway but you didn't know you were
04:30 and you were just standing there totally
04:33 dealing with yourself dealing with age
04:34 dealing with everything learning things
04:36 be translating knowledge into wisdom and
04:39 also in the train comes by and it's this
04:40 you know it's all painted up beautifully
04:42 and it's got all kinds of pictures of
04:44 people that are perfect and you know the
04:47 doors open and if you're a girl and you
04:48 like boys then
04:50 a bunch of hot guys telling you to come
04:51 on and it's the opposite you like girls
04:54 they're waving you in and you just kind
04:56 of dumbfounding li going because it
04:58 looks like it's better and there and in
04:59 a haul ass to the next dimension which
05:01 is insanity and you lose yourself you're
05:05 back there at the original starting
05:06 point you know one thing I find
05:09 interesting in conversations as of the
05:12 21st century for sure because I crossed
05:16 30 in the year 2000
05:19 is that people tend to gravitate in
05:23 conversation with other people based on
05:26 their level of maturity and the more
05:29 you're sort of in the medium to low you
05:32 can find quite a few people to have a
05:34 conversation with but you find out at
05:36 the end of the conversation you really
05:38 didn't talk about anything and that's
05:40 obviously none of you guys who are
05:42 hardcore listeners you're probably here
05:45 because we have been through that and
05:48 it's not like we're better than anyone
05:50 else it's just we're at a higher level
05:51 of complexity with what we want to talk
05:53 about some things are very existential
05:57 and spiritual and interesting ghosts and
05:59 physics and that kind of thing what's
06:02 the shape of the world that those kind
06:04 of neat topics but now we're in a kind
06:08 of a state of emergency or at least
06:10 we're being told we're in a state of
06:11 emergency and it's really up to the
06:13 adults to guide us through these phases
06:20 you know I've said it several times and
06:22 I have heard other people say it as well
06:24 one of the reasons why many of us think
06:28 that people hate Donald Trump is that
06:31 when you go into the life of someone who
06:34 very much dislikes him they have some
06:38 authority figure in their life that
06:39 abused them and so having a stern father
06:44 figure run the country for the very
06:47 first time since I don't even know when
06:50 maybe Kennedy was a father figure
06:52 maybe I think we can say that Lincoln
06:55 was most likely a father figure Andrew
06:57 Jackson was a father figure there's this
07:00 rejection of Trump because it's like I
07:02 want the
07:04 you know little kids to run the country
07:06 which means anything goes anything goes
07:10 and there's several different you know
07:13 Star Trek's there's one back in the 60s
07:18 where Captain Kirk found a planet it was
07:20 being run by kids you know ranging from
07:22 about 16 down to like six because the
07:27 spaceship crashed on that planet and
07:29 eventually all the adults died and so
07:31 the little kids had to just take over
07:32 and it was this word Peter Pan world and
07:34 so Captain Kirk was there trying to
07:36 reason with the oldest boy to get him to
07:40 you know let him help them but what did
07:44 they just fuss and fuss didn't they and
07:46 that episode of Star Trek is an absolute
07:51 mere image or I should say direct copy
07:54 clone of what America is dealing with
07:57 and these last three years my buddy
08:01 Robert Llewellyn in the UK he used to
08:04 have a vlog before he did his fully
08:07 charged show part prior to that the
08:11 carpool show where he invented
08:13 carpooling as a television show
08:16 he's the og dude who made that format
08:19 happen but he made an episode once and
08:24 he started off the episode by simply
08:27 saying just a little vlog he said you
08:29 know what I'm my listener said what do
08:32 you think about getting old and at first
08:36 he said well you know doesn't impact my
08:39 acting career because I play a robot and
08:41 reg war so I get to our mask but he said
08:44 you know what he goes when I was young I
08:47 looked up to those that were older than
08:49 me they were safe
08:53 wise folks and even if they had to pass
08:56 out some discipline in his direction he
08:58 realized that they were right and he was
09:00 wrong he needed to behave he needed to
09:02 learn something and so he said you know
09:05 he's probably about mid-50s I think when
09:08 he did this he looked at his face in the
09:12 camera and he's like you know I like my
09:14 wrinkles because I like my gray here
09:17 losing my hair he doesn't want to be
09:20 unhealthy in terms of gaining weight or
09:22 anything he's pretty much the same size
09:24 dude all the time but he went on and on
09:28 he's one of the most articulate amazing
09:30 human beings out there after he was done
09:34 with that vlog he changed my life
09:36 forever
09:37 because I was like yeah that is cool
09:41 you know yet I got long hair right now
09:45 I've had long hair since 2009 okay I
09:49 didn't have long hair before then it was
09:51 just something I did I was running my
09:54 game company I guess it's by 2007 to be
09:56 honest I just stopped cutting my hair he
09:58 just kept getting longer and longer and
10:00 I finally felt like it was the way I
10:03 feel inside and I'm sort of upset with
10:06 myself that I didn't do it way way
10:07 earlier as a young kid but eventually my
10:12 hair will recede it'll do whatever I'm
10:15 gonna cut it off and that'll be it it'll
10:17 be over I'll never have long hair again
10:18 and then I will look much much older
10:23 okay I'm gonna be much much older - so
10:29 it's okay it's alright man now some
10:33 folks really dig it
10:34 like my buddy Robert I've told you guys
10:37 and again I'm gonna hit a little bit of
10:39 the cosmetic side of things because I
10:41 think that feeds into our sort of
10:45 rejection of becoming more stoic and
10:49 mature because we feel like something
10:52 some people feel like this that if we
10:55 were ever to grow up and ever to to lose
10:58 the bouncy youthful self that we will
11:07 automatically age a hundred years
11:09 physically and boy will just be rejected
11:12 by society because we're so old no no
11:15 that's true none of that's true you can
11:18 be as fun speared it is possible as
11:21 humanly possible I should say for
11:23 yourself and still be looking like
11:27 father time you know
11:28 I went back to my high school reunion
11:31 last time and I've said this a couple
11:33 times for the hardcore listeners but I I
11:35 noticed that a few of us look like we've
11:40 barely aged and some of us look like we
11:46 had aged 10 20 years beyond everyone
11:50 else now one of them was that the folks
11:53 that smoked cigarettes which again are
11:56 nothing like cigars at all automatic 10
12:01 years added to the life consequently the
12:05 strange thing was the folks that smoked
12:06 cigarettes
12:08 let him didn't have teeth and that was
12:11 pretty unique it's pretty rare people my
12:14 hometown to have teeth but there's a few
12:16 stragglers that have teeth but the ones
12:21 that really looked old I should say
12:24 older and they don't they don't any
12:28 problem with what I'm about to say so
12:29 this is no criticism whatsoever but it's
12:31 just an interesting scientific thing it
12:34 relates to the probably the neural
12:35 peptides that are well-documented in the
12:38 movie
12:38 what the bleep did we know but they
12:43 would sit around and talk about being
12:45 old they pat their belly literally lean
12:49 back you know pat debility that kind of
12:50 thing you know their bellies table
12:52 muscle and all that kind of stuff but
12:55 they had more sayings about being old
12:57 than anyone I know
12:59 I mean I you know we're all about I
13:02 guess they were about 48 when they were
13:05 doing that I graduated really young so
13:08 that's 47 but it's just fascinating
13:13 seeing you know their adaptation and
13:16 acceptance and then professing their age
13:22 really aged them a lot it's very
13:24 interesting
13:26 the difficulty in really trying to
13:29 isolate what I'm trying to get at it
13:31 when I know that most of you kind of
13:32 feel it out but it's important in the
13:36 conversation to to get to a point so
13:39 maybe where we can enlighten each other
13:42 different thought processes about this
13:44 whole thing we are the most immature
13:47 [Music]
13:49 generation that has ever been in the
13:52 United States of America from every
13:55 boomer all the way down to probably the
13:58 Millennials
13:59 I think the Zoomers have shown an
14:02 interest in being more stoic and they're
14:07 less social media they're less video
14:11 game they're more about getting out in
14:13 life playing a guitar reading a book so
14:17 I think the Zoomers and I don't know
14:20 what you call the ones that come after
14:21 that but they are a very interesting
14:24 group of folks and you know when I deal
14:29 with my screenwriting friends where we
14:33 have to sit around and talk about the
14:34 demographics that are out there and who
14:36 wants what we are definitely
14:40 acknowledging the massive difference
14:43 between the Zoomers and the Millennials
14:45 where we can lump Millennials Gen X's
14:47 together with slight changes in dress
14:50 code and facial hair generally the same
14:54 product sells to both the boomers you
14:58 know they're the first generation to
15:00 come out of the post-world War 2 era and
15:04 it was a good era even though they had
15:07 the Korean War and nukes and stuff to
15:09 worry about in the 50s about 1958 now
15:13 even though the Vietnam War was going I
15:17 think that it that that war kind of
15:20 warmed up so slowly that we got you know
15:25 Michael Jackson Prince and just a bunch
15:27 of amazing people but the boomers just
15:32 to kind of give you a some of the stuff
15:36 some of the more interesting stories
15:37 that I know from Hollywood those of you
15:39 who watch a lot of making of videos of
15:41 your favorite movies you'll know this is
15:43 true but I was very fortunate I think
15:50 because of my own maturity to really
15:53 befriend folks that were
15:55 - 25 years older than me and just become
15:59 best friends because I know the I just
16:03 know their past they know their past and
16:06 so we're very compatible with
16:07 appreciating film to that level or
16:10 whatever but most of you understand that
16:13 you know all the movies made from 1975
16:16 to say 1990 are made out of boomers most
16:21 of them of which were massive hippies
16:25 took tremendous amounts of acid and saw
16:29 the universe at a level that few have
16:32 ever seen it
16:33 and of course acids got all this
16:36 ridiculous ridiculous myths about it I
16:40 mean they they they take everything the
16:43 heroin cocaine does and then put it on
16:45 asset and it's like there's no it's
16:48 really if it's really acid you're
16:50 perfectly fine the only bummer is if you
16:53 have a lot of skeletons in the closet
16:55 the closet door is gonna open so make
16:58 sure you're a balanced minded human
16:59 being and then you'll have an experience
17:04 that will change you for the rest of
17:05 your life and it won't be like being
17:07 drunk you'll actually be sentient Lee
17:08 there and when you get out of it you'll
17:11 feel like you went to a museum and every
17:14 day that goes by after you take your
17:16 first trip which would be the best ever
17:19 my advice is to take as much as you can
17:21 quite frankly on that first trip it'd be
17:25 with someone who knows what the hell was
17:26 going on anyway it'll just feel like you
17:30 know it's two weeks since I went to the
17:32 museum four weeks since I went to the
17:33 museum it's not gonna go away like a
17:35 dream or anything like that which is why
17:37 a lot of people say you only need one
17:39 trip but you want to plan it and get
17:41 your soul ready but these individuals by
17:45 being raised by stoic parents which is
17:50 your pre boomer parents right they had
17:54 this amazing wisdom sort of imbued in
17:57 them through sheer experience now there
18:00 was I saw this rebellious stage with
18:03 rock-and-roll especially right where
18:04 they had rules and the rules were
18:07 actually serving them quite well
18:09 get married have a kid get started
18:12 before you're 22 years old have your
18:15 kids when you're young so your kids are
18:16 really healthy plus the women's bodies
18:20 bounce right back because they were
18:22 really young man you have you want to
18:24 have three kids you could M dumb by the
18:27 time you're 30 you bounce back you
18:30 either go to school or finish school go
18:33 to work whatever you want to do is the
18:35 lady and it all worked out but there was
18:38 there was sort of this rebellious split
18:40 in the United States and I'm not sure
18:42 about any other country but like my
18:44 parents never went the hippie route but
18:47 girlfriends of mine have parents that
18:49 went to mega hippie route both signs
18:53 sort of paid prices when I got here to
18:56 Los Angeles the second time really got
19:00 close to film got into film I started
19:03 interviewing these guys about their
19:05 experiences you know there's just give
19:09 you some four instances there's two guys
19:10 that I guess Van Vleet and Cassady
19:15 they're the two lightning drawing guys
19:17 and Hollywood they did the Lightning in
19:20 Star Wars they did a lot of like saber
19:24 work they did the lightning that's in
19:26 Tron when he got poked with a cattle
19:28 prod thing and so you sit and you
19:32 interview these guys Van Vleet I mean he
19:34 went on with Spielberg into Indiana
19:37 Jones stuff and just it's just
19:39 tremendous Richard Edlund oh I know
19:43 fairly well
19:45 tons of Oscars he's a camera designer
19:48 he's just an amazing Duty did all your
19:50 special effects for all those Star Wars
19:52 movies he was a he was in San Francisco
19:57 driving trolley cars just before he gets
20:00 the job in San Rafael or wherever the
20:02 Skywalker Ranch is which should tell you
20:07 that you can be anything in the world
20:08 and you can get to those amazing moments
20:11 in your next job you know you're like
20:12 driving a trolley car gone this is now
20:14 all my life is supposed to be about and
20:15 then all of a sudden you're making a
20:16 landmark movie in motion picture history
20:19 right
20:21 but even though these individuals were
20:25 hippies at one point and even though
20:27 they took massive amounts of acid I
20:29 don't think any of them really played
20:31 around with cocaine or definitely not
20:33 heroin speed was usually like something
20:37 you did just to stay awake while you're
20:39 working I doubt that that had a lot of
20:42 impact on these individuals but they
20:46 were able to take on the responsibility
20:50 of making a feature film of a monumental
20:54 size Star Wars 3-year production cycle
20:58 now of course George Lucas had already
21:00 done American Graffiti thx 1138 so he
21:04 was sort of the you know the thrust and
21:06 the thread that brought it all together
21:09 of course other people worked on the
21:11 film who had worked on several frames
21:12 before but there was a lot of
21:15 first-timers I think Phil Tippett's
21:16 first film was Star Wars
21:19 what's interesting now is that we tend
21:23 to live our lives in two different ways
21:27 we either pioneer our lives because we
21:30 have the maturity to understand what
21:32 we're doing we understand our goals and
21:35 if there's a void in how we can
21:38 accomplish what we're trying to
21:39 accomplish we know how to go get the
21:41 information and then we get better and
21:44 we practice and then we execute right
21:49 all day today for instance I've been
21:52 modeling a Star Trek Enterprise that I
21:55 designed in 1997 and it's been an a side
21:59 view top view for 23 years and I've
22:03 always wanted to 3d model the thing and
22:07 so I didn't know if it would actually
22:08 look good I didn't know if it would work
22:09 and so I got into it my blender a
22:13 product I'm doing much better I'm taking
22:15 like three classes actually four classes
22:17 in that and the classes are just
22:19 upgrading me every single day I watch
22:21 one lesson like oh my god that's that
22:23 that's how I solved that problem oh yeah
22:25 this is great technique throw away
22:26 destructive model and build a non
22:28 destructive Molly also there's stuff
22:30 I've modeled this thing it's just a
22:32 prototype model but my god it works it
22:35 looks sexiest [ __ ] okay that's what
22:38 these guys did today
22:41 we obviously have massively talented
22:43 people all over the world look at the
22:45 Marvel movies look at writing on like
22:48 Westworld season one I mean there's some
22:50 serious talent out there but when you
22:53 come out of like the Disneyland realm of
22:57 the world and come down to like mortal
23:01 human beings this is where the reaction
23:05 to mass media telling you statistics
23:10 that aren't true and then watching how
23:14 people react the adults calm everyone
23:18 the children exacerbate everyone try to
23:22 like become important by usurping
23:25 disasters that's not maturity that is a
23:30 raving child that's screaming for help
23:33 my concern is this we are in a moment in
23:40 time which is unlike anything even my
23:45 grandparents I mean maybe my
23:46 grandparents who were the pre boomer
23:49 generation they went through a good 10
23:53 years of depression had all their gold
23:56 confiscated then had a they took part in
24:00 a world war and even though America
24:02 didn't get involved in World War two as
24:05 fast as history might make you feel we
24:08 got attacked in 41 we fought a Pacific
24:11 battle that was much shorter than the
24:14 Atlantic battle but we didn't go over
24:16 and start stepping on European soil
24:18 until like the last year and a half or
24:21 so the war right might even just been in
24:23 the last year like 44 but they went
24:27 through all of that and then popped out
24:29 and got a glory day situation which
24:32 usually led to the birth of all these
24:34 kids the boomers the baby boomer
24:37 generation now as the world
24:41 reconstituted out of the depression
24:43 in out of the World War two phase we had
24:46 adults at the helm they built the little
24:50 towns that I grew up in and you know by
24:53 the time that I was going on my town was
24:55 probably just hitting about a hundred
24:56 years old
24:57 and so they had great people before them
25:00 literally build the town build the
25:02 streets build the buildings establish a
25:05 bunch of businesses and then as my
25:06 grandparents generation moved into the
25:09 sockets you know it was like the old
25:11 generation moves out the next generation
25:13 moves in you should still bought a car
25:15 from an adult you still got your
25:18 services from adults today it's sort of
25:22 hit and miss right so like maybe every
25:25 other person maybe it's a you know three
25:28 out of five sort of ratio or adults
25:31 maybe and then you have raving children
25:36 running around you know blowing all
25:39 their money trying to impress people
25:41 that don't exist they can drink a ton of
25:43 alcohol smoke a bunch of dope and maybe
25:46 you drive a fancy car nobody cares
25:51 so we're potentially I know things look
25:57 you know dark right now I have all the
26:05 confidence in the world our economy is
26:06 going to bounce back literally the word
26:10 on the street is is increasingly louder
26:14 and louder that
26:18 the Federal Reserve just got a knife
26:20 right through its heart which is the
26:23 greatest news we could have ever heard
26:25 in America so there's a potential that
26:29 by the end of the year we're gonna have
26:31 our own currency again backed by the US
26:33 Treasury a nationalized Bank and the
26:37 only people that have taught you that a
26:38 nationalized Bank is bad is the Federal
26:41 Reserve who's the competitor to such a
26:42 concept but let's say in a year or two
26:47 maybe even less we gain control over not
26:51 only America but as soon as Europe sees
26:54 what happens in America you folks over
26:57 there you're gonna riot like crazy
26:58 you're going to destroy the EU you're
27:01 going to rip down EU flags like you know
27:06 Baghdad ripped down statues of Saddam
27:08 Hussein you're going to call this the
27:12 Dark Ages 2.0 that you ever created the
27:15 EU and that you ever joined it that you
27:17 bankrupt yourself that you let your
27:19 country get overrun by folks that have
27:22 no respect for your culture your
27:24 religion and your way of life and you'll
27:28 clean it up I have no doubt you'll clean
27:30 it up might be a little rough for some
27:32 of those immigrants but you're gonna
27:34 clean it up
27:35 maybe I'll integrate them maybe I'll
27:38 throw them out I don't know it's up to
27:39 you men over here we have a pretty good
27:43 mix right now we can deal with
27:44 everything that's here now we're used to
27:47 simulating and all that kind of stuff
27:49 and perhaps your country does too but
27:52 what I'm concerned about is taking over
27:58 for these corrupt individuals there's an
28:03 interesting thing happening in Africa
28:05 right now especially South Africa and
28:07 I've watched documentaries on it I've
28:11 watched interviews with native African
28:14 individuals not the imports from Europe
28:18 and many of these districts that are
28:21 being sort of returned back to the
28:23 natives that were you know some were
28:27 really well capped some of them weren't
28:30 but they're going to hell I mean these
28:33 places are getting overrun by their own
28:36 native folks and they're just destroying
28:37 the whole place there's trash everywhere
28:41 people are the gangs have moved in I
28:46 mean it's not safe to be there anymore
28:47 even if you're 100 percent African and
28:50 that's what can happen if you're not
28:54 mature enough to maintain what you found
28:58 and so we have to make sure in all
29:01 corners of the world but if you can hear
29:04 my voice if you can repeat this to
29:06 someone else you know we have to
29:09 potentially some of you might even
29:11 become politicians at some point because
29:13 there simply is no better choice but
29:16 even if you're gonna cast a vote it's
29:18 important that you understand well
29:21 that's uh what is a good candidate I'm
29:24 sure that the word maturity refinement
29:27 some sort of chieftain synonym is in
29:31 there somewhere
29:33 and that's just running the country
29:36 that's determining your foreign policy
29:38 your domestic policy all the economics
29:41 saw the environmental considerations
29:44 because we have a lot of things to fix
29:46 in all categories in America you know
29:49 our minimum wage is completely screwed
29:50 up but doubling more than doubling it is
29:53 ridiculous which is what they've nearly
29:55 done here locally so they're not doing
29:58 anything logically because politicians
30:00 are just schmoes half the time to just
30:03 want a free paycheck some are extremely
30:07 dedicated and they deserve to be elected
30:11 children I know Michael Jackson sing
30:16 about it a lot and maybe it's even sort
30:18 of a cliche in your mind but children
30:22 are the future of the world and if
30:26 they're raised badly that doesn't matter
30:29 how much you have your act together in
30:31 one generation the whole place can go to
30:34 hell and we know that the one commodity
30:39 of this world that is in more dire
30:43 straits than even
30:46 meaning that there's more food than
30:48 there is of this other thing and the
30:50 other thing is called education the
30:55 entire planet is drastically uneducated
31:00 yes there are nerds in every single
31:03 culture there's a Brainiac African kid
31:06 Brainiac Australian kid American kid
31:09 Canadian kid Chinese kid there yeah
31:11 there's brainiacs but don't let that go
31:13 to your head until you can look around
31:17 and say well everyone's like that kid
31:19 then we got work to do I always tell you
31:22 on this show that you know one of the
31:24 reasons why I created this show was
31:26 because of the thing I said and probably
31:27 the third or fourth episode which was
31:30 life does not come with a manual you
31:35 don't get a manual when you turn 18 to
31:37 tell you how to be an adult or 25 or
31:39 when you have your first kid or when you
31:41 want to court someone or marry someone
31:44 we're out here and the wild wild west
31:47 and you know what the manuals are in
31:49 this world today it's called advertising
31:52 and there's two types of advertising
31:55 isn't there there's straight-up you're
31:58 about to watch a commercial and you
31:59 understand you're watching a promotional
32:01 ad then there's the subliminal
32:05 indoctrination you're watching your
32:06 favorite Star Trek show and they're
32:08 telling you the ozone layer exists not
32:10 only does it exist there's a hole in it
32:12 and Dadda Dadda done
32:14 you watch Pacific Rim and you can tell
32:17 in that little scene towards the third
32:19 act where the guy starts talking about
32:21 global warming and killing dinosaurs and
32:24 all this other crap that boy just just
32:27 narrative injected right in there deep
32:29 state agenda21 crap right in your film
32:32 just so that dude could get a little bit
32:34 of money to pay first film Al Gore's
32:37 movie the Inconvenient lie is shown to
32:43 kids since December 2006 was a mandatory
32:46 viewing thing such as they buy into all
32:48 this carbon credit crap you see they're
32:53 smart the ruling class of the world
32:56 despite when England's critique
32:58 they're getting [ __ ] done where they're
33:01 not they're completely insane which I
33:04 don't think they are I think they're
33:06 just humorous if nothing else but they
33:10 if you were just to let the things go
33:11 that are moving today
33:13 well 97 to 99 percent of the world would
33:16 be depopulated at we'd all be moved into
33:21 these cities with these 5g towers eating
33:23 up our entire DNA giving us dizziness
33:27 and headaches and the inability to sleep
33:30 and concentrate and remember anything
33:32 okay
33:35 you wouldn't be free I mean you would
33:37 literally feel more surveyed and more
33:41 controlled than the average prisoner in
33:43 a private for-profit prison in the
33:45 United States of America that's how
33:48 smart they are they got it all ready to
33:50 go if there are really brilliant people
33:55 out there designing robots at Boston
33:57 Dynamics those robots you are watching
34:01 with him create the fleet of PEEP of
34:04 like Boeing or virtual robots that are
34:06 going to take over all law enforcement
34:10 probably for the first country they can
34:13 afford it replacing the military and
34:17 just brace yourself men you won't be
34:20 able to yell at a robot giving you a
34:22 ticket you know all those things they
34:25 try to appeal to the friendly face of a
34:27 highway patrol person can I you know
34:29 please don't give me a ticket that
34:31 robots just gonna be like take your
34:33 ticket when you write a screenplay they
34:38 teach you that in order to take your
34:41 protagonist and actually make them a
34:43 hero it's creating you know an intent
34:50 with an obstruction and then like
34:54 they're trying to do something and it's
34:56 not working and so like I'm a guy every
34:58 move a hero makes decisions under
35:00 pressure and they make usually the right
35:05 decision more often than the wrong
35:07 decision if they make the wrong decision
35:10 it is should be portrayed in your script
35:12 as complete mistake they're just trying
35:15 to do their best and it's not working
35:16 out the blue wire the green wire not
35:19 trying to blow everyone up in the room
35:20 they're just using what they have to
35:24 make it work I just watched a little 23
35:29 minute documentary about it's made 2007
35:32 and it's about gangs and South Auckland
35:35 New Zealand and I don't know what the
35:40 situation is now but you know ten years
35:43 after we stopped all of our craziness in
35:45 Los Angeles
35:46 these kids are worshipping the gangster
35:50 mentality in Los Angeles they leave it
35:52 tell you to your face that's exactly
35:53 what they're copying and there was a
35:56 little scene in the documentary where I
35:59 guess this was much older guy problem in
36:03 his mid-50s
36:04 he had his house broken into some
36:06 clothing stolen his he's a foster parent
36:10 for this little boy who was headed
36:14 towards getting in a gang and he's now
36:16 giving them a lot of alternatives which
36:18 is really cool hopefully kid didn't end
36:20 up in that situation but the kid got
36:22 freaked out the little kid because he's
36:24 got someone in there and so these kids
36:27 who are probably between 15 and 18 are
36:30 still walking around the town they're
36:32 still threatening this little
36:33 ten-year-old kid and so finally the
36:37 ten-year-old kid came home one day
36:38 during the filming of this documentary
36:40 since they're right there by the mall
36:42 that's that's one of them right there I
36:44 want to right there and he points him
36:45 out to this dude so this dude calls the
36:48 cops he calls his on backup and within
36:52 two seconds the old man is like right on
36:55 top of this probably 16 17 year old kid
36:58 and first and foremost because he was
37:01 professional but because he was a mature
37:04 adult and a chieftain gene he grabbed
37:06 the back sure the kid and stopped him
37:09 he's probably four inches shorter than
37:11 the kid and the kid just freezes looks
37:15 like when you grab a cat by its neck man
37:16 the cat just goes whoa so imma stop
37:19 right but he lectures the kid you know
37:24 what the hell he thinks he was doing do
37:27 you have my stuff I want you to
37:28 apologize to me I want you to apologize
37:31 to my son I want you to go get the kids
37:33 got my crap and bring it to my house and
37:35 you know it was one of these situations
37:38 where in today's climate that dude is
37:42 like a rare being because in today's
37:46 environment
37:47 you got a parent who's had their house
37:51 broken into their child terrorized stuff
37:54 stolen from their house and they find
37:56 the kid in Orange County probably at
38:00 your face bashed in doesn't matter how
38:01 young you are the adults gonna tear you
38:03 a new one depending on how big you are
38:05 right but this kids a big kid he's a big
38:07 bully but this dude showed complete
38:11 compassion for the situation because
38:13 he's mentoring this kid at home trying
38:15 to keep him out of gangs and so he knows
38:16 that if he if he goes gangster on this
38:19 Punk
38:20 he's got to come home and tell the kid
38:22 but that's what he did and that's
38:24 exactly what the kid would learn as the
38:25 right thing to do and he doesn't want
38:29 that little ten-year-old to hear that
38:30 story and so the dude filming the
38:32 documentaries like filming is pretty
38:34 close you know and after it's all over
38:36 when they have an agreement you go get
38:39 my stuff go get the kid that has my
38:41 stuff I want you to bring it to my house
38:42 where I could have any problems but once
38:44 she apologized to me he's basically
38:46 saying I want you to grow up I want you
38:49 to understand this is not right and I'm
38:51 giving you a break and you know I'm
38:53 giving you a break because I could haul
38:54 your ass to the cops like I tell you to
38:56 your parents or whatever right the guy
39:00 filming it looks at the guy he says that
39:04 took an amazing amount of restraint
39:05 didn't it he's like yeah man he goes I
39:08 am really pumped up right now because I
39:09 I can just tell you I want to just beat
39:12 the kid up but I know that that's just
39:14 gonna be more of what I don't like about
39:17 this world and I'll be part of the
39:20 problem
39:20 that's a chieftain that's a hero making
39:24 a much better decision under pressure
39:26 not to be violent not to return the
39:30 favor
39:31 that he gave the family
39:35 and the kid was pretty cool I mean the
39:37 kid caved you could hear his voice was
39:41 scared and likes like my psyche my
39:43 sociology teacher in high school always
39:46 told us he says look he goes if you had
39:49 a six foot four 18 year old fighting a 5
39:52 foot 8 40 year old he goes as long as
39:56 both I've know how to fight he goes I
39:57 will put all my money on the 48 year old
39:59 or 4 year old or whatever any day and
40:03 we're all looking at him kind of funny
40:04 we're like well he hasn't the kids other
40:05 kids bickering he goes yeah but
40:07 confidence is everything and you know
40:10 that's exactly what was on camera in
40:12 this little documentary you know we have
40:15 people this is a big subject of
40:19 discussion in America it's probably
40:22 happening in your district too but
40:23 America you know we do have our kind of
40:26 cowboy mentality it isn't just a
40:28 complete rumor there's a branch in my
40:34 cigar right there holy hill but right
40:40 now for instance we have a lot of very
40:42 corrupt politicians intelligence agents
40:45 former presidents former secretaries of
40:49 state very very corrupt people plus all
40:51 of their hangers-on IT companies that
40:57 are very Kabbalah Sh and you know when
41:02 we start seeing the damage that they're
41:05 doing does something that took hundreds
41:10 of years to get to where it is today and
41:14 it's everything we could do to hold it
41:16 together just with the normal chaos of
41:17 the world and then you know within a 15
41:22 year period we have an infiltrator after
41:26 infiltrator come through the country and
41:29 treat it like a dirty rag it's very easy
41:33 as the United States citizen to say look
41:37 these people are treasonous t'k
41:39 individuals they try to destroy the
41:41 Republic the dream of freedom
41:47 freedom to all things stream to you know
41:50 worship the religion that you have
41:52 freedom to procreate up to a reasonable
41:55 level right and so we can get very very
41:59 angry at those individuals and even say
42:02 things off the cuff that it's very you
42:04 know they should be you know hanging
42:06 from the gallows or you know whatever
42:08 and you know it's it's that formula from
42:14 the walking dead the RIC formula
42:17 actually had someone disagree with me in
42:20 the comments which i thought was sort of
42:21 cool
42:23 now I'm gonna spoil season 2 of Walking
42:27 Dead to make this point but if you
42:29 haven't seen a show that's dead then I
42:34 don't think you're probably likely to
42:36 watch this but it won't ruin the show
42:38 for a hint in the long run but there's
42:41 two cops at the beginning of the show
42:42 when the world is normal and how they
42:45 get Shane and Rick and their buddies
42:49 their partners right around a cop car
42:52 then the apocalypse happens this virus
42:55 or whatever it was that turns people
42:57 into zombies you know hits the streets
43:00 everybody starts either dying or turning
43:02 into zombies or whatever and he goes for
43:05 two seasons I think it's to where Shane
43:09 starts to get the attitude that probably
43:12 I would have which is look the world
43:16 just went to [ __ ] and we can't put this
43:17 back in a bottle because these people
43:20 who are zombies are never gonna be cured
43:21 of being zombies they're just zombies
43:23 and so until we can lob all their heads
43:26 off and live in peace we're gonna be
43:29 losing people left and right and during
43:32 that time the humans that are still
43:34 around are gonna be feral and they're
43:37 gonna be starving to death they're gonna
43:38 rob and kill to survive there's no more
43:41 code of ethics anymore in mankind and
43:44 they had seen this 100% in their
43:47 experience in the first two seasons just
43:49 nearly dying several times losing part
43:51 of their clan dove zombie attacks Costa
43:54 but now Rick was the actual sheriff of
43:58 the town and so his whole thing is to
44:01 keep the peace to be the hero to make
44:03 those tough decisions under pressure and
44:06 to make sure we don't lose our humanity
44:07 as sort of where he felt in the spectrum
44:11 of things so at the very end of season
44:13 two it really came down to that came
44:17 down to a little bit more than that he
44:18 thought Shane was well Shane started
44:23 sleeping with his wife because they
44:24 thought he was dead and then they said
44:26 he said I'm really sorry dude I thought
44:28 you were dead we thought you were dead
44:29 we were told you were dead and so we
44:34 just kind of you know comforted each
44:36 other and now that you're back hey it's
44:38 totally cool man won't touch her it was
44:41 a bit of that backstory behind there too
44:42 but there's a showdown in a field I
44:44 think kind of during the day and it
44:48 really came down to Rick's philosophy
44:51 versus Shane's philosophy and Rick said
44:55 you know your philosophy is gonna get us
44:56 killed because you're gonna turn us into
44:58 those feral beings and we're gonna just
45:00 be always at war with people and
45:02 eventually my sons gonna get killed
45:04 and so I need to make sure that we don't
45:07 fall down that realm that we take the
45:09 high road and this will be over before
45:12 you know it you know all the zombies
45:14 will be dead and then we'll rebuild
45:16 society and we won't be a bunch of you
45:19 know Mad Max people trying to rebuild
45:21 society will just be heavily injured
45:23 normal people and so we had a showdown
45:26 in the field and Rick killed Shane and
45:30 over the course of the rest of the show
45:32 probably I would say before season 7
45:35 started Rick learned that Shane was
45:38 right not that he was happy that Shane
45:42 was right it just really got down to the
45:44 point where they had lost so many people
45:47 but that Rick was like yeah you know
45:51 what if we don't turn into Shane's
45:53 philosophy then we're all dead and Rick
45:58 became so much worse than she never was
46:01 which is part of the brilliant part of
46:03 the writing that archetype for me is
46:06 huge as we face this
46:08 you epoch right because the thing is is
46:12 we're getting incredibly educated about
46:15 how the world works but you know I would
46:20 say that the most the two most important
46:23 groups of people that we can educate
46:24 right now and they are self educating
46:28 quite well today it was much tougher 15
46:32 years ago but the military is our number
46:36 one priority to educate if you have
46:39 family members in military you've got to
46:43 figure out how fast they can digest this
46:45 information figure out they're already
46:46 doing it and then you feed them the most
46:49 prime rib
46:51 you know filet mignon information of the
46:54 best source don't give them freely weird
46:57 crap don't tell them that
46:58 crazy loose theories are true you could
47:01 present it to them and say man was we're
47:03 hearing this on the street the number
47:07 one thing is that every military person
47:09 in the world has to believe in common
47:11 law over anything that they might be
47:15 told to do same goes for the second tier
47:19 which is our police officers that
47:24 depends on you know there's a big
47:26 difference between military folks and
47:28 police officers depending on how the
47:31 military has been deployed if the
47:34 military is at home and believe me this
47:38 is one of the reasons why they love to
47:39 keep Wars going forever the military
47:42 understands that if your citizens are at
47:44 home then they have a level of
47:46 appreciation for life that the military
47:49 does not want them to have at least the
47:51 previous command so keeping your sons
47:55 and daughters over in the Middle East
47:56 for three tours or whatever means that
47:58 they have no idea what it's like to be
48:00 in society they become war creatures and
48:03 they become damn good at it right and so
48:07 when they are told to cease weapons out
48:10 of a person's house you may actually
48:12 have a more apt person to follow
48:14 commands because they've been so
48:16 disembodied from their true family unit
48:21 they don't know anything else but police
48:24 officers are constantly dealing with
48:27 domestic violence issues and I will say
48:29 having written you know a number of
48:31 scripts with police officers in them and
48:33 having to interview them they're the
48:35 most down-to-earth people on planet
48:37 earth and one of the things that I I can
48:40 just tell you without asking them
48:41 directly is when they find out that
48:43 you're a good person that they would
48:46 most likely never ever be called to your
48:49 house unless you have an emergency
48:50 health emergency or something you can
48:55 just see them relax and just tell you
48:58 anything you want to know cuz a lot of
49:02 police officers you know they're just
49:03 lied to constantly did you do that no
49:07 you know they gonna stay got a [ __ ]
49:09 knife through their head and they're
49:10 like did you hurt your wife no you know
49:13 she's got a crowbar through her chest
49:16 you know it's like so they see a lot of
49:19 it but those that's our cornerstone in
49:21 the United States at least to make sure
49:23 that crazy [ __ ] doesn't happen I'm a
49:27 little frightened that England has
49:31 somehow been able to breed I think
49:35 fairly intelligent human beings that
49:38 will violate your civil rights in the
49:42 name of the government you know well he
49:44 posted a pupu comment on facebook and
49:47 these [ __ ] will show up to your
49:49 front door and you know where did you do
49:52 that thing for what are you talking
49:53 about freedom of speech right don't we
49:55 have freedom of speech in England oh I
49:56 guess not
49:56 I didn't incite violence oh I didn't
49:59 tell you to kill anybody I just was
50:00 expressing myself and I disagree I'll
50:04 tell you what if it wasn't for live
50:05 streaming on telephones
50:06 I think there'd be a lot more people in
50:10 Europe in jail but they start the live
50:14 stream before they open the door then
50:16 they hold it up and they go my Facebook
50:18 page he goes I got like five yous
50:21 he's filming you right now so say what
50:24 you got to say and boy their demeanor
50:27 I've seen it man it changes but then
50:29 you're like what are they doing here in
50:31 the first place how did they talk
50:32 themselves into it
50:35 and you know it's funny I'm gonna put
50:38 this in right here as we kind of mulch
50:40 what it means to be mature and to have a
50:43 little bit of reserve in our system
50:45 before we act I've said this before but
50:49 you know in America the big thing that I
50:53 think especially when I worked with my
50:55 friends from England I work for a
50:57 company that was founded in England for
50:59 three years three or four years the two
51:02 different two different runs and then of
51:05 course I've got some friends over there
51:06 as well but the big difference between
51:09 conversating was someone whose natively
51:11 from there to here at least the
51:13 professional sector of things you might
51:15 be able to quota you know an area that
51:18 doesn't do this but is that they seem to
51:21 think before they speak I've mentioned
51:23 this once before but America is all
51:25 about this land of you know your mouth
51:28 and your brain are just 100% connected
51:31 you know as soon as you form a thought
51:34 the syllables start coming out of your
51:35 mouth right there's no let's think and
51:37 think about this well if I said that
51:39 they'd have this emotion if I said that
51:41 they'd have this emotion I want the best
51:43 emotion in the room so maybe I won't say
51:45 either one and I got over the third one
51:47 they just everybody just shut up you
51:49 know maybe I don't even need to say
51:50 anything one of those kind of moments
51:52 right because the United States is bred
51:58 to be reactionary
52:00 to be as quick with the mouth as the
52:02 brain translates thoughts into other
52:05 thoughts
52:05 we don't benefit much from the concept
52:10 that is there's two sides to every coin
52:14 so in America because we're so quick
52:18 with our mouths we don't benefit from
52:21 the concept that there's two sides to
52:22 every story you know two sides to the
52:25 coin is they used to say right and so
52:31 there is probably you know more domestic
52:35 violence there's more business disputes
52:38 there's more conflict because the people
52:42 that are the authoritative people that
52:45 need to act
52:46 this is where I actually really really
52:49 respect the police officers at least
52:52 that I'm exposed to because they come in
52:54 they hear one person throw down their
52:57 story well he did this he did that and
52:59 then all of a sudden they okay well you
53:01 sit right there and you may put you in
53:04 my car if you're totally nuts and they
53:05 go off and get the other person's story
53:07 and then they start pushing the two
53:08 stories together
53:09 determining what's most likely to have
53:11 been true or they're not both of them
53:12 are lying while I'm still in truth
53:14 whatever the observable facts and they
53:18 act they're trained to do that if only
53:22 the rest of us would do it you know I've
53:27 always thought that life well I should
53:29 say always but as I grew up I finally
53:32 figured out you know probably my 20s as
53:36 I started to see the Delta between being
53:39 you know an adolescent I guess I could
53:45 say you know just every decade of life I
53:47 should probably put it that way so one
53:49 through 10 10 through 2020 through 30
53:51 and then every stage of life that they
53:54 seems to occur to us in each one of
53:56 those realms you know some people marry
53:58 in their 20s some people marry in their
54:00 30s but you you're single with your
54:02 family as a child
54:03 everything's taking care of you pretty
54:05 much you got to go to school brush your
54:07 teeth and comb your hair sort of thing
54:09 and then as you start to approach the
54:12 end of high school you know you got to
54:15 get some type of career together whether
54:18 you're gonna go to college or not then
54:20 you jump into society eventually you
54:22 find someone you want to spend the rest
54:24 of your life with maybe you have a
54:27 family maybe you don't but if you do
54:30 then you become a parent and then you
54:31 have about 18 years of your youngest
54:34 child before you're gonna have any
54:35 reprieve and then maybe you got to earn
54:38 the money to put them to college then
54:42 they have kids eventually you become a
54:44 grandparent and then usually if you live
54:48 a normal life your kids at least your
54:50 oldest will have a child that has a
54:53 child and you'll have four generations
54:55 alive just before you pass away which is
54:58 always fun
55:00 we actually had that happen on my mom's
55:03 side because their parents were 10 years
55:05 younger than my dad's side so a fourth
55:08 generation picture is pretty cool but
55:13 each one of those realms offered a
55:17 beautiful full spectrum experience being
55:21 a parent's a full spectrum experience
55:23 from being a parent of a young child
55:25 versus a teenager versus an adult
55:27 everything changes over talking a lot of
55:31 times grandparents get to watch the
55:33 grandkids and so you get kids back in
55:35 your house but now you're not totally
55:36 responsible for them you're just a
55:38 little bit responsible for that's cool
55:41 and then even though we die and it
55:45 happens right then it gets blamed on
55:47 Corona of course even though we do die
55:50 at some point you you you're not dying
55:55 dying right your body dies right I'm
55:58 really starting to think that we hang on
56:00 to life a little too much as human
56:02 beings like we pretend like this is it
56:05 now I think that you know a hundred
56:08 percent you should give every human life
56:10 every life that you ever have your all
56:13 even if you came back as a bear do the
56:16 best bear routine you possibly can but
56:18 definitely is a sentient human being
56:21 keep going keep getting better try to do
56:24 something you haven't done before or do
56:26 it again and do it better make better
56:29 decisions the next time you come around
56:30 I guarantee you that whatever state
56:34 you're in when you pass away the next
56:36 state you're going to experience is one
56:38 of complete comfort no more pain one of
56:44 the things that bothered me when I was a
56:45 kid and you tell me your thoughts on
56:49 this particular one because I would love
56:51 to hear because it's something I never
56:52 hear discussed which is that when I was
56:57 this is probably seven eight nine
56:59 somewhere in there I learned that old
57:01 rule that you never ask a woman how old
57:05 she is
57:06 and it's usually I guess over 40 is
57:09 where it kind of starts
57:12 and it was this weird vanity that made
57:16 asking that question suddenly forbid
57:20 even though I'm a child and I don't know
57:24 you know I'm trying to piece together
57:26 what we look like when we get older I am
57:28 NOT going up to my grandmother knowing
57:30 you were old you know if I were to say
57:34 that I would just be thinking you're
57:35 older than me but you know when I was a
57:39 kid it was like okay well dad how old
57:41 are you look at his face and I go okay
57:44 that's maybe what I'll look like when
57:46 I'm his age 30 whatever 35 whatever but
57:51 as I get older I thought what a crock
57:53 that we allowed this ridiculous routine
57:57 to start that was you don't say how old
58:02 you are kind of straight pure
58:05 narcissistic vanity and you know it's
58:09 only with the females guys didn't care
58:11 but I guess the whole idea was of course
58:14 that one woman might age more in
58:17 appearance than another woman
58:19 now that woman new age is more I have
58:21 five kids for god sakes
58:23 she is birthed into this world human
58:26 life while the one that looks younger
58:28 has never had a child all right
58:32 maybe one of the people have had a
58:34 harder life and one of men easier life
58:37 and we're supposed to conceal that which
58:41 creates us that's what makes us who we
58:43 are and I think that that's sort of the
58:47 little thread in the sweater that if you
58:49 pull it out
58:50 supposedly society and raffle sometimes
58:53 even a hold it was wasn't it Zsa Zsa
58:57 Gabor she always lied about how old she
58:59 was why why seriously the woman looks
59:05 fantastic in fact the older she was in
59:07 real life for how she looked it was it
59:13 was a total success story I saw this old
59:17 movie and it was like had luck in its
59:21 name it was Betty Davis
59:23 Betty Davis who was obviously known for
59:26 being one of the most beautiful women in
59:28 Hollywood very eccentric looking she had
59:31 these amazing eyes right but she did
59:35 this movie I think in the early 60s I'm
59:39 pretty sure where she allowed her she
59:43 played a woman who was a street lady and
59:45 here's a woman who was used to being you
59:49 know just fond over but I saw her allow
59:55 herself to not only be on camera with
59:57 absolutely no makeup I think they put
60:00 more freckles on her face they put this
60:02 horrible wig on her on her head or at
60:06 least I'm pretty sure it was a wig but
60:08 they was ratted up gray hair thing and
60:11 it was like later she was the street
60:12 woman like a homeless person who sold
60:15 apples and the Apple gave this this
60:19 nightclub owner some good luck in his
60:22 mind and eventually it's one of the best
60:25 movies you've ever seen your life if you
60:26 haven't seen it go look it up it's on
60:28 one of those like Turner Network sort of
60:31 things but eventually they have to
60:34 pretend for her daughter who lives in
60:39 Europe
60:39 who's gonna come to visit her in America
60:42 she has been lying to her daughter the
60:44 entire time that she is nobility and
60:48 that she knows she knows everybody in
60:50 the town and so now this gangster
60:55 because he needs the Apple does her a
60:58 favor because his girlfriend loves the
61:01 old lady and is very empathetic and he's
61:03 not very empathetic and so he agrees to
61:07 throw the biggest party ever and to fake
61:10 all of the dignitaries that she says she
61:13 knows and they do this makeover on her
61:16 because he's wealthy and the girlfriend
61:19 has like everything right the hair the
61:20 makeup and everything and she goes off
61:24 into the room a homeless person and then
61:27 of course she's Betty Davis even though
61:29 she's older she comes in the room after
61:32 that and she is utterly transformed
61:35 and it's an amazing thing and I when I
61:38 saw that I remember her being on what's
61:42 my line probably two or three times and
61:46 I think at one point someone asked the
61:49 question with the blindfold on how old
61:51 she was and of course about the audience
61:54 laughs because you don't ask women that
61:55 question and I think at some point she
61:58 answered it or something like that but
62:01 she managed to either not build up that
62:05 that weird a narcissistic barrier or she
62:09 got over it and for me that makes her
62:13 bigger than everybody else when I first
62:17 started working with the British company
62:20 in the early 90s there was a lot I
62:24 didn't know it was almost everything I
62:27 didn't know about England but they told
62:31 me very quickly like my boss and stuff
62:33 was trying because they would come over
62:34 and visit like the founder would come
62:35 over and visit and I was one of the lead
62:37 engineers at one point and so they kind
62:40 of briefed me on how to talk to him and
62:42 they talked so quiet I could barely
62:43 understand the thing you were saying you
62:45 know I mean how I would sits three feet
62:47 away from the founder and he talked to
62:48 me and I'm sitting there really young I
62:50 have bionic hearing and I'm going I have
62:53 to ask you what you just said you know
62:55 but one of the things that I learned and
62:58 I don't think it's that way as much
63:01 anymore because America has infected
63:03 England please correct me if I'm wrong I
63:07 protected Llewellyn at length about this
63:11 but that used to be that professors in
63:15 academia were the superstars in England
63:19 and then it switched to the celebrities
63:22 and from what he's told me I believe was
63:26 that you know the Beatles were able to
63:28 come and go and even the Rolling Stones
63:31 were able to come and go and the who
63:32 were able to come and go and they were
63:35 in the old era and so they can walk
63:37 around the streets and people won't
63:38 bother them and he told me this
63:41 interesting story that one the keyboard
63:43 player from the who passed away he
63:45 happened to live in the same
63:46 neighborhood as Robert LaVon
63:49 it's like a modest gated neighborhood
63:51 but nothing that insane I'm just quoting
63:53 him but he goes I you know he goes I
63:56 looked out my window and he goes I'm
63:58 watching like Robert Daltrey Mick Jagger
64:02 and like Keith Richards walking up the
64:05 street just talking to each other which
64:09 must have been a surreal moment man and
64:12 because they're getting murdered for the
64:13 services that day and he goes no one's
64:15 bothering them because it is a gated
64:17 neighborhood but there are young people
64:19 and kids around but no one touched him
64:21 and then he goes I because he's Crichton
64:24 on Red Dwarf which is a comedy has been
64:27 running since 1988 still goes to this
64:29 day as I understand it but he says I had
64:32 to leave the house that day to go down
64:33 into the grocery store to get some you
64:35 know milk and things for the family and
64:37 he goes I get mauled at the grocery
64:40 store and he goes compared to these
64:43 other guys who were in town because I'm
64:45 nobody you know because what I'm getting
64:47 mauled because I'm in that next
64:49 generation of kids but the celebrities
64:51 are more important than the
64:53 knowledgeable people of the world and I
64:57 think that because we're coming to a
65:00 close in this episode the big difference
65:04 that I see in the transformation of my
65:07 own experience in life is that during
65:13 the 70s as a kid I definitely saw a
65:18 massive transformation from you own
65:23 quality items that are the essentials of
65:27 life you have you have a relatively nice
65:30 house you have a nice car but nothing
65:34 insane you wear nice clothes but nothing
65:36 insane and that was what that was fine
65:43 that's why everyone had money to go on
65:45 vacations to pay for kids colleges and
65:48 that kind of thing
65:48 he also had a single income household so
65:50 I was about seven years old but then
65:54 this the advertising got insane and I
65:58 mean advertisings always existed you
66:00 know but I mean I have invested a lot of
66:03 time and why
66:04 advertising from the 40s 50s and 60s and
66:07 even though there were a lot of crazy
66:09 items for sale there wasn't this you
66:13 know ridiculous go well beyond your
66:15 means to to pay for something and buy it
66:18 you know but today we're not satisfied
66:22 with the basics anymore there has to be
66:26 something that you own that is eccentric
66:30 expensive impressive you have to have
66:33 one of them if you can own two of them
66:36 you know it's like you keep going and
66:38 going and going
66:38 I think about someone who you know I'm a
66:43 big apple guy Apple Computer guy you
66:46 know you know I'm I'm a huge Apple dude
66:48 right but I've started to move over to
66:51 Windows so I've definitely gotten out of
66:54 the ridiculous iPhone thing and now it's
66:57 a bonafide you know crappy product line
67:01 the only thing they make that isn't
67:03 complete trash in my opinion for the
67:05 money but be the iPad and perhaps the
67:08 iMac those two things are fairly
67:10 affordable but even the iMac now I
67:13 priced one out fully loaded it's $4,000
67:19 okay
67:21 you know what kind of Windows machine
67:23 you could build with that kind of money
67:24 you could buy a thousand dollar video
67:26 card and still have the fastest of all
67:28 things on planet Earth and a PC it's
67:32 ridiculous but that's a brand now the
67:37 cost more than all the other brands does
67:40 not have the equal speed of the
67:41 competition it looks cooler but they do
67:45 you know making you know shaping
67:47 aluminum and glass to look cool it
67:50 doesn't cost you more money for the raw
67:52 materials necessarily the competing
67:57 products are made of the same materials
67:59 and they cost you know half the price
68:00 run at maximum speed I've said this a
68:05 hundred times on the show but this is a
68:07 good point to a place to repeat this you
68:11 have to know that all my friends that
68:12 are extremely wealthy
68:15 either never got into this buying
68:18 material objects to create something
68:21 valuable in life because they're
68:22 creative people what's more important to
68:24 them is they create the next album
68:27 that's awesome the next movie that's
68:29 awesome or something else they create
68:33 but I have been in several country clubs
68:36 that are very popular very difficult to
68:39 get into smoke lounges full of you know
68:43 outside there must be without a doubt
68:46 you know anywhere from two to five
68:48 million dollars in cars and there's only
68:49 ten cars outside and when I go inside
68:53 now listen to the people that own these
68:54 vehicles they're not that creative and
68:59 so for them that's all they have so and
69:04 then they're very smart people they make
69:06 money not all of them are trust fund
69:08 kids but it's sort of like you put that
69:12 in place of something else that would be
69:15 more rewarding to your soul you know I I
69:20 grew up my whole life not realizing how
69:22 wealthy my grandparents were on my mom's
69:25 side but now I look back and it's like
69:31 my grandfather he owns only New Yorker I
69:35 think it's what it was and Dodge Omni
69:40 like two really basic vehicles the dude
69:44 could have had a Mercedes he could have
69:47 whatever he wanted but he didn't and the
69:50 cool thing was the house they lived in
69:52 had shag carpet we had two rooms with
69:54 like orange shag carpet you you actually
69:57 went to the house and they would assign
69:59 you your room pipe the color of the
70:00 carpet they gonna say in the Blue Room
70:02 downstairs okay blue shag carpet
70:04 toasters you're in the orange room
70:05 upstairs okay you're the one room
70:08 downstairs
70:08 you're the brown rooms downstairs it's
70:10 kind of damp and Crazy's where I grew up
70:13 for my 17th year it was kind of musty
70:16 down there they didn't have to have that
70:20 kind of house they could have totally
70:22 had a house built from scratch and make
70:24 it amazing but what was important was
70:28 the kids who grew up there we're now
70:31 able to come back home and visit their
70:33 parents at a house that they grew up in
70:36 and so there's all this nostalgia at
70:39 that house you know it's not owned by us
70:42 anymore but if I were able to go there
70:46 depending on how much they've either
70:47 changed the place or left it alone I
70:49 know that if I went to one of the
70:51 bathrooms and just took a shower just
70:53 brush my teeth I would relive you know
70:56 got thirty years of my entire life
70:59 being in those homes it was interesting
71:04 think about the world being freed up
71:09 from all of this chaos that we are now
71:11 experiencing think about the world
71:14 ejecting all of these evil people and
71:18 then we have to go in there and repair
71:23 the damage that they've done you know
71:26 eight hundred thousand children a year
71:28 disappear on planet Earth
71:30 eight hundred thousand and even if you
71:34 want to say well some of those kids are
71:36 runaways
71:37 alright let's give you an absurd runaway
71:40 percentage which is not true it's way
71:42 too high fifty percent are all runaways
71:47 I've looked at statistics before when
71:50 Jeb Bush was losing 1,200 kids a year in
71:52 Florida the statistics were more like
71:55 twenty to thirty percent were Runaways
71:57 because the other percentage is so young
71:59 they have no means of running away
72:01 they're like a ten year old or an eight
72:02 year old right they don't get that far
72:05 these kids are disappearing for reasons
72:08 that we don't have to necessarily
72:09 discuss on this episode many of you know
72:12 they don't go to good places I would say
72:16 out of 800,000 20% are probably dead by
72:19 the end of the year because of where
72:22 they end up going or where they get
72:24 taken to that's a lot of damage that's a
72:28 lot of damage souls for anyone who
72:30 survives those situations we have been
72:33 at war on this planet for so frickin
72:35 long that we have enemies that we
72:37 shouldn't have
72:39 all because of bankers trying to do one
72:43 thing or the other so we got to repair
72:46 cultural relationships we have to find
72:50 polite ways to tell people you know
72:53 sorry
72:54 your religion doesn't work here it's not
72:58 gonna exist in this country ever alright
73:02 and we look forward to the day when your
73:05 religion disappears you're you know
73:08 castrating women and all that crazy
73:11 Sharia law stuff we cannot afford to go
73:15 back 1020 thousand years and the Codex
73:18 of how man operates because that's
73:21 primitive jungle crap all right all
73:26 right so we've got to be the bigger
73:27 people we got to figure out peaceful
73:29 means we can't create more enemies
73:32 trying to get rid of these classic ways
73:36 of doing things for those individuals
73:39 that's gonna take some work it's gonna
73:42 be tough but we have to do it so anytime
73:48 we want to effect a sociological change
73:51 to the world anyone who with any brains
73:55 will tell you it's got to be a
73:56 psychological change first
73:58 then once we have one thing figured out
74:01 in our life not everything figure in our
74:03 life we can start to have the
74:05 conversation with other folks you may
74:07 have a conversation or to get over that
74:10 psychological issue
74:11 look man I'm trying to stop doing this
74:14 what do you think I said you know how
74:16 can I think about this I'm gonna tell
74:19 you something my friend told me
74:21 yesterday that utterly blew my mind and
74:24 I'll leave you with this because I think
74:27 it's an awesome little reward for
74:29 getting to the end of this episode this
74:31 is not my thinking some of you may know
74:34 where this actually comes from she told
74:37 me that because we were talking about
74:39 the cyclical problem of bad habits of
74:44 parents on to their children and then
74:48 they do it to their children and the
74:50 subject came up of abuse
74:53 an abusive parent that physically abuses
74:56 the child doesn't always have to be that
74:58 particular issue but that's just this is
75:00 where you're gonna understand this more
75:03 than ever and then I'll give you one of
75:04 my own examples and then we'll close it
75:06 out it's not violent the theory goes
75:11 that when you are being beat by your
75:17 parent you are the loser and they are
75:22 the winner and when you get older you
75:26 may find yourself beating your own child
75:30 in order to be the winner and you know
75:35 this happens with a string of boys if
75:38 family has say three boys and the
75:41 parents have done a bang-up job raising
75:43 these kids right the older son beats up
75:47 the middle son then the middle son beats
75:49 up the younger son and it's because they
75:51 are transferring the notion of winning
75:55 down to the next generation
75:57 now I'm the winner you're the loser and
76:00 then the next kid makes himself the
76:02 winner and someone else is the loser now
76:06 as soon as you understand that mechanism
76:08 which is so beautiful and so simple you
76:11 can apply this to anything that you have
76:13 a bitumen heritage from someone else
76:16 like your parent now I've said several
76:20 times on the show the the one thing that
76:22 really has bothered me in my lifetime
76:23 which I've learned to deal with as I got
76:26 older was it the thing that cuz I'm
76:29 really I'm really a relaxed cool dude
76:31 yeah I mean I mean you know like cool
76:33 isn't just I don't get terribly excited
76:36 unless I'm having fun right I'm having
76:38 fun I'm crazy but the thing that makes
76:42 me angry is when someone betrays either
76:46 me personally which I can deal with that
76:49 a little bit easier depending on what
76:50 kind of material it is definitely
76:52 betraying the team like if I run a
76:54 company I run a group of people and
76:56 someone is deliberately slacking off
76:59 when they have plenty of energy and life
77:01 is good for them they're just being a
77:03 jerk
77:04 and you know you give everyone a little
77:06 second chance you know you're kind of
77:08 gone a dude what's going on you're late
77:10 for work again everyone's having to make
77:12 up for you you're delaying the entire
77:13 project that that uh I'm gonna give you
77:17 a really short second chance not a big
77:19 one when I give you a short one so for
77:22 the next 72 hours I need to see that
77:24 change immediately starting tomorrow you
77:28 got issues you need to tell me now
77:29 forever hold your peace right but at
77:33 times I have seen people in friendships
77:35 and professional situations continue to
77:38 screw the team just because they're that
77:41 kind of person you know and in the past
77:44 what I would do is because I was raised
77:48 by military dad who was fairly you know
77:51 he's very cool but man he when he
77:55 thought you were screwing around and you
77:57 were doing something wrong and you knew
77:58 better it was my father the way I would
78:03 describe it today whether he recognizes
78:05 this today or not I don't know or
78:07 especially be recognized it back then
78:09 was his thing and you've heard this
78:12 probably in your lifetime which is
78:13 someone says I raised you better than
78:15 that
78:16 right I I taught you what was right and
78:19 what was wrong and you're acting like I
78:21 didn't do that you're acting like I you
78:24 know that somehow you can get away with
78:27 this because someone never told you how
78:29 to do it right
78:29 like guarantee you I tell it you touch
78:31 it I do it right and so you beat my ass
78:33 right something serious the last time
78:37 you even put his hand on me once was I
78:38 was 14 or 15 years old and he was wrong
78:42 and he apologized it was kind of funny
78:44 but I took that into my world and I
78:51 would really react when I was younger
78:55 and usually when I working at a
78:57 corporation I definitely don't do that
78:59 even in my own company but you know I've
79:02 told you several stories during the show
79:04 or people were screwing the team and me
79:07 and I would just absolutely unload on
79:10 these people man
79:11 and you know it it did in some cases
79:15 definitely permanently fix the problem
79:18 because we all kind of hugged it out
79:19 afterwards but in some cases it
79:21 definitely did not help anything and
79:23 they people just you know in order to
79:26 get away from their bad performance
79:28 would exit the program in a way that
79:32 permanently hurt everyone who was
79:35 involved and then as I matured and grew
79:40 up I thought geez you know there was a
79:42 way for me to communicate in every
79:44 situation where I lost my cool
79:47 there was probably a way to get across
79:50 the same exact thing with with a
79:52 sternness and with the same level of you
79:55 know communicated disappointment without
79:59 losing my cool get my heart rate up
80:01 really bad and so you know after my
80:08 friend told me that I thought you know
80:09 I'm gonna use that every single time I
80:11 feel like I might be losing my normal
80:14 control I don't have to be the winner
80:17 ever but I can still win I could maybe
80:23 even make it a win for both of us by
80:25 taking a step back doing what my British
80:28 mentors did in the 90s think about it
80:31 before you talk play a few scenarios out
80:34 I'm always telling you that I practice
80:36 what I say if I have a big speech or
80:38 lecture or something like that
80:41 so anyway maybe maybe that's analogy or
80:44 a mechanism that you can use at some
80:48 point in your life I just wanted to pass
80:49 that on because I was stand in my
80:51 kitchen last night just just my brain
80:53 was like oh my god that's a really cool
80:55 thing and now I finally understand which
80:58 I cuz I could never understand fully why
81:03 the kids they get beat beat their kids
81:06 because I would think that the logical
81:08 thing would be because I know play I
81:10 actually know plenty of people that
81:11 followed the opposite route that I'm
81:13 about to explain but they they would
81:16 never touch their kids because they were
81:17 abused in fact some of them were almost
81:21 ridiculously incapable of raising their
81:23 children because the children needed a
81:24 little bit
81:25 discipline not the major but they were
81:28 unwilling to be a disciplinary parent
81:32 because they just didn't want to walk in
81:34 their parents footsteps under any
81:36 circumstance and sadly every child needs
81:40 to be raised you know so here's your
81:43 quiz for the end of the episode for the
81:45 comment section tell me what you think
81:49 your definition of being an adult is
81:51 because I asked my friends and even
81:54 though we were able to talk for an hour
81:56 to two hours of peace and each one of my
81:58 conversations and we were able to
82:00 identify several touch points for the
82:03 first five to ten minutes everyone was
82:04 like jeez man I'm not exactly sure what
82:07 that is and what's sad about that for
82:10 all of us is that there isn't an
82:13 immediate answer that is sort of
82:16 all-inclusive right almost as if there's
82:19 no cliche for being an adult it should
82:24 you know cliches are things were tired
82:26 of hearing but usually they have an
82:29 amazing empirical level of knowledge
82:31 built into them right this world needs
82:36 to grow up and I don't know which
82:38 regions of the world might have that in
82:40 ample supply but I would say the United
82:44 States of America is not one of those
82:46 places we're just to Hollywood and
82:49 botoxed out to know what it's like to
82:52 get older appreciate the phases of life
82:54 look forward to them instead of trying
82:57 to spend money to never have them occur
83:01 and I'm just gonna put a button on this
83:04 the one thing I want the mend to
83:09 understand this is just from one guy to
83:11 another guy because I've heard you know
83:15 one of my girlfriends once said she goes
83:19 she says you know it's really hard being
83:21 a woman in this day and age and getting
83:24 older and I said well okay
83:26 I believe you but please itemize that
83:29 for me a little bit and she goes well
83:30 women don't age as well as men and so we
83:35 are told by society and Society tells us
83:38 back
83:38 that we are supposed to look young and
83:40 beautiful for as long as we possibly can
83:43 and she said you know when you hit your
83:47 40s that becomes a very slippery slope
83:51 to achieve and so every day we get older
83:55 we get more self-conscious and more you
83:59 know sad with this goal that we can't
84:04 reach and so to the I know the plenty of
84:07 men out there understand this even
84:09 better than I do we have to cherish our
84:13 women and you know I know a lot of you
84:19 guys absolutely do like I like older
84:21 women more than I like younger women
84:22 period but you choose it because they're
84:26 way more mature and I'm all about the
84:27 brain more than anything else but you
84:29 know I've got friends of mine who are
84:32 female who will send me you know
84:34 pictures of their family hanging out and
84:38 every once in a while the family but at
84:39 the beach and so the the my friends are
84:42 in their bikinis okay another my each
84:45 but they'll send me a photograph and
84:48 they will have you know changes in their
84:51 body due to having children and they'll
84:56 always apologize in the photograph after
84:58 the photograph well you know sorry my
84:59 tummy is showing you know and I got the
85:01 stretch marks or whatever and I did have
85:04 three kids and other kind of thing and
85:05 it just it breaks my heart because in my
85:08 mind I'm like I always say back hey you
85:12 took you took one for society right you
85:15 brought amazing kids into this world you
85:17 did a great job raising them those are
85:21 those are sort of trophy marks they're
85:23 not something that makes you less than
85:25 someone else the amount of wisdom you
85:28 gained by having those little stretch
85:30 marks air in there whatever you know
85:32 quote-unquote damage you think you have
85:35 I don't view it that way I know people
85:40 have never had kids that are 150 pounds
85:43 overweight I have more disdain for that
85:46 than I do someone who just incurred
85:48 something because they brought life into
85:50 this world so one of the things that as
85:52 men have to start telling our women in
85:56 this world regardless if they're your
85:58 girlfriend or just a friend is that
86:02 those aren't bad things those are good
86:04 things that's one thing that I think men
86:06 in America have to grow up and start
86:08 communicating and there's plenty
86:10 husbands out there that do it
86:12 there's plenty husbands I got a couple
86:14 that I know in Kansas that they're both
86:17 in their 50s and she had four kids four
86:20 amazing children and she would say
86:24 certain things like this but her husband
86:26 will walk up behind her and grab her and
86:28 hug her like they're 18 years old both
86:31 of them he loves her today probably more
86:35 than when they first got married and I'm
86:37 pretty sure when they first got married
86:38 this guy was a giddy nerd loving his
86:41 wife so I see it happen it happens more
86:45 in the Midwest I will sing in the United
86:47 States and it does on the coast let's
86:49 see what we can do about sort of
86:50 upgrading the maturity of men in that
86:53 particular area okay I'm done with all
86:56 that talk anyway if you have them into
86:58 deep thoughts radio calm please Gil I'm
87:01 gonna make it short today we have a
87:02 couple video links we have plenty of
87:04 podcast links for social media links a
87:07 couple ways to donate we got a store

87:39 you
