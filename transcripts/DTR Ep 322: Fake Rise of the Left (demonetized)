00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:37 deep thoughts I've had this agenda on my
00:39 telephone list of things to do for
00:42 months and what I wrote down on my phone
00:46 was the fake rise of the left I needed
00:52 to think about a little bit to figure
00:54 out what am I having a feeling about and
00:58 how could one articulate this into an
01:00 hour-long show that has any value right
01:03 his day in late November I swear to god
01:08 I'm already about 75 degrees out it's
01:10 beautiful I got it all bundled up and
01:13 jumped outside knowsley damn it's more
01:18 the rise of the left you know there's
01:22 always been this left-right paradigm
01:24 since I've been alive at least here in
01:27 America they have different names for it
01:31 in Europe but it's generally the same
01:34 thing my conservative versus a liberal
01:37 we always have to have two sides
01:40 therefore we have two opposing forces
01:42 right keeps us essentially inbred as
01:48 young people to always be at odds with
01:51 someone think about it if somebody says
01:56 you have to join one side or the other
01:58 well how many choices can you can you
02:01 make how many sides can you be on as the
02:05 only person you are gonna pick one
02:10 you're not going to Captain Kirk a third
02:13 and go at him and I don't have to follow
02:15 your [ __ ] rules I don't choose to
02:18 side with either group in fact I looked
02:22 into what they were thinking and I kind
02:23 of think I like both of them at the same
02:25 time at least aspects of them of course
02:28 we have the far left and the far right
02:29 which are the Superfriends II almost
02:33 non-existing groups when it comes to
02:36 world population they're gonna start
02:38 mowing lawns both sides of me right now
02:42 so you never know when they're gonna
02:43 come they're supposed to come to noon
02:45 they're here about two hours early
02:48 what's happened though in the last
02:50 several months last couple years in
02:54 America we've had this you know media
02:58 magnifying glass put on this absolute
03:00 extreme progressive left a left that
03:04 doesn't exist in most towns in America
03:09 you'll have people there's that there's
03:12 some billionaire [ __ ] in California
03:13 running these ads on YouTube to impeach
03:16 Trump he's claiming that his group is
03:19 six million people well when you're
03:23 really really young what is your major
03:24 concern your major concern is being safe
03:29 and being accepted because you don't
03:32 know what not being safe and not being
03:34 accepted really ends up meaning in the
03:37 end for you right so you jump on the
03:39 bandwagon it's much easier as the young
03:41 person and depending on who is feeding
03:43 you your paradigm and telling you what
03:46 is good and what is bad you were gonna
03:48 jump on one or the other with all due
03:50 haste aren't you
03:52 but what's the quickest way to get
03:54 someone to react quickly
03:55 I think obviously are several accurate
03:59 answers but one of them is to make
04:00 someone feel very insecure so now think
04:04 about this for a second
04:05 usually groups form and exist because
04:08 they feel the need and imperative to if
04:12 left alone right there's just so many
04:17 groups of you know from the most
04:19 esoteric group of folks that play with
04:22 robots and they have to get together to
04:24 share how did you get that to work how
04:26 does the code work for that the old
04:28 clubs that used to assemble computers
04:30 back in the day before they actually
04:31 were sold as units all the way up to you
04:37 know some girlie retreat where women
04:41 need to get away to talk about women
04:43 things because they're the only ones
04:46 that truly understand what it's like to
04:47 suffer the slings and arrows of
04:50 femininity right it is my opinion that
04:55 some of these groups would never exist
04:57 that there wasn't some ulterior motive
05:01 some agenda to create radical tree
05:03 change they wouldn't normally happen
05:06 these organizations take a tremendous
05:09 amount of money to exist because they
05:12 have to get at the entire ecosystem of a
05:14 human being to indoctrinate them below
05:17 the age of five and then between five
05:19 and ten is a different agenda than a
05:20 five or excuse me 10 to 18 vehicle trait
05:25 the colleges they will award grants and
05:30 what-have-you
05:32 they'll contribute to building a wing on
05:34 the side of a college as long as they
05:36 hire some liberal agenda based snowflake
05:40 professors right the reason why I
05:43 emphasize the need to spend a lot of
05:46 money to create these groups is because
05:49 they're so radical and they're so out of
05:50 the pocket of the normal consciousness
05:52 of man that they would never exist
05:55 except maybe an infinitesimally
05:59 naturally the other thing is to look at
06:03 the people that are inside these groups
06:05 who are at the top not the kids that
06:07 have been convinced that Donald terms
06:08 taken away the rights of LGBT and then
06:10 when asked they can't come up with a
06:12 single [ __ ] example very typical
06:14 right but the people that are trying to
06:18 convince these groups to exist and to
06:20 vote on their behalf right because
06:21 there's all kinds of agendas and any
06:25 type of voting process any of you look
06:26 at the measures or props that are being
06:29 put forth in your local County you'll
06:31 see all the taxation all the [ __ ]
06:33 you know some you'll see all the
06:35 lobbyists basically right the the
06:38 pharmaceutical companies to try to sneak
06:40 in some methodology of quadrupling the
06:43 cost of their medicines you'll have a
06:45 real-estate agency that wants to our
06:48 property development group that wants to
06:50 develop you know giant portions of your
06:52 local region but you won't accept it on
06:54 the outside but inside of a prop if they
06:56 word it the opposite of what it is
06:59 you're willing to vote on it you can
07:04 never get the ingredients of a
07:06 vaccination by reading the side of the
07:07 bottle and you can never get the actual
07:11 effects of a prop or a measure by
07:14 reading it
07:14 ever you need a bunch of people on the
07:18 inside to say okay what's actually being
07:20 signed into law because I'm not looking
07:22 at that piece of paper thus turning into
07:24 a law or a prop or a major I'm looking
07:29 at some synopsis that's been designed to
07:31 make me say yes big [ __ ] difference
07:35 people right but now where else do we
07:38 see an extreme group I'm focusing on the
07:41 left in this episode
07:42 I might actually end up in titling it
07:45 with both sides because I think that you
07:48 hear a lot less from the extreme right
07:51 so leftist and left progressives which
07:54 are your nut bags on that side of the
07:55 fence they will often reference who is
07:59 an extreme right winger on the right
08:01 side it's pretty much in the documented
08:06 magnifying glass mass media perception
08:09 wheel which is absolutely anything but
08:11 reality they talk about anybody
08:14 right-of-center
08:15 as being an extremist if you so much as
08:18 acknowledge the Constitution of the
08:19 United States you're an extremist but
08:22 under Bush jr. we were all deemed
08:25 extremists if we were to cite the very
08:28 fabric of the Constitution during our
08:31 arrest if you were to cite your rights
08:34 it's that lexicon of homeland security
08:37 all right if you know the IRS is a
08:40 voluntary system you're an extremist you
08:42 know your rights as a citizen of this
08:45 country you're an extremist this was all
08:47 written under chair Tov you know the son
08:50 of Mossad and Bush jr. it was part of a
08:54 his own little family coup I mean this
08:57 country was run by some amazing insiders
09:01 for a very very long time
09:05 so who is your extreme right I have to
09:09 say it's very difficult to really define
09:14 your extreme right I think your koch
09:15 brothers might be an extreme right the
09:18 chaos eh out of Kansas where I'm from I
09:21 haven't done a tremendous amount of
09:23 research on them they always seem to be
09:25 kind of involved with something that's
09:29 jaw-droppingly ridiculous a lot of times
09:32 its corporate greed but then again on
09:35 the left it's super corporate greed as
09:37 well I think in your left progressives
09:40 you'll find a bunch of movie stars who
09:42 have been buying and selling children
09:43 hanging out with spirit cooking women
09:46 they're defending their camp because if
09:50 they know if Donald Trump and the most
09:53 of the citizens of America get our way
09:55 we're gonna catch him I put them all in
09:57 jail so that's why you get again Robert
10:00 De Niro is coming out against Trump
10:02 Biden is coming out against Trump look
10:05 up Biden being a pedo and look at Robert
10:07 De Niro spirit cooking lady I've said
10:10 this in episodes I'm gonna continue
10:11 beating it up until every single one of
10:13 you as soon as you hear about these
10:15 couple [ __ ] going after our
10:17 president going after this country you
10:19 just say we'll go look that up
10:20 Biden running for 20/20 ha well you'll
10:23 be 79 years old or something we'll just
10:26 run real after real him squeezing little
10:29 girls chests in the White House during
10:32 photo ops because he thinks he's so
10:34 [ __ ] invincible right yeah secret
10:37 email servers are to do what oh yeah
10:42 transmitted secrets right the illegal
10:44 secrets pay-for-play clinton foundation
10:48 secrets but here's what's interesting
10:52 the agenda of your far left and your
10:56 agenda of the far right if you were to
10:58 turn it into an animal the tail of the
11:01 snake looks identical to the head of the
11:04 snake and so there's that an old adage
11:07 of it eating itself right it really does
11:12 join on both sides of the extremist
11:15 argument but for most of you who are
11:19 awake you know that well most of us are
11:25 directly in the center even if we think
11:27 we're a little bit left or think we're a
11:28 little bit right we really are directly
11:31 in the center what would make you sway
11:34 left to right yeah
11:36 maybe left you believe in well you've
11:39 never fired a gun and so you're very
11:41 scared of guns and so you want them all
11:44 gone before you ever deal with an
11:47 earthquake hurricane a tornado and
11:50 you're having to protect your property
11:51 on your land before the burglar the
11:54 one-in-a-million situation but the
11:56 burglar starts coming through your back
11:58 window what makes you a right-winger
12:01 we're probably just the opposite you
12:03 believe in the Second Amendment you
12:04 believe in the freedom of speech you
12:08 don't think we should be spied on by
12:10 anybody eavesdropped on we have allowed
12:15 just like Magna Carta right I was
12:18 watching some old episodes I think I
12:20 misstated my level of confidence with
12:22 how well America has done when it comes
12:25 to how well we've defended our
12:29 Constitution because under Bush jr. as a
12:31 result of that day in September 2001
12:35 nine of the ten Bill of Rights got wiped
12:37 out and then the Boston bombing took
12:41 care of the last one which is harboring
12:43 soldiers in your house but now if you
12:47 just were to be introduced to their I
12:50 States of America you're some foreigner
12:52 you're an alien from another planet but
12:54 you speak fluent English and you come in
12:57 and you start looking around at what's
12:58 on television what's on our newspapers
13:00 magazines and the overall internet
13:03 communication social media you know
13:07 platforms and what have you you would
13:08 swear to God that the left progressive
13:11 extremists [ __ ] nut balls are running
13:15 this entire country and why is that it's
13:20 because the media is all left all of it
13:26 Fox News is pretending to be right right
13:29 now but they print bogus information
13:34 24/7 they tell you that you know I told
13:40 you several times that agreements that
13:42 we are pioneering with other leaders are
13:45 going south they tell you they just just
13:48 basically take ap Reuters and push it
13:51 through
13:53 maybe they're a three on a five-star
13:56 rating system for being progressively
13:59 left or as all the others are extreme
14:02 left right CNN's all the major networks
14:05 NBC ABC CBS MSNBC all the rags out there
14:13 way left and if you think about it
14:18 you're going to have to fend off all
14:23 that information in order to have your
14:25 own opinion about where are you if you
14:28 live in America I have no idea how bad
14:30 it is in Europe I have no idea what the
14:32 station's are over there I know the BBC
14:34 is controlled by the government
14:36 they literally review everything that
14:39 goes out if it even gets remotely close
14:40 to home right you couldn't possibly run
14:43 a piece about the royal family without
14:46 having it literally watched previewed
14:49 and reviewed by agents of the royal
14:52 family wow this is sound like freedom
14:56 the press to me now obviously someone
14:59 can write an article and publish it and
15:00 you know David Icke has been calling the
15:02 Queen a lizard for 3128 years basically
15:08 right he's still alive but now if you
15:12 take all of this input and you change it
15:16 to something let's say you're not a
15:17 progressive left person maybe a little
15:20 bit left
15:21 maybe mostly centrist centralist you
15:23 believe in the Republic right which is
15:28 do no harm
15:29 sovereignty freedom for all your wages
15:33 are your property etc etc it's like the
15:37 vanilla Constitution except without
15:39 women to vote and we don't have racism
15:42 legalized racism right not that the
15:46 Constitution said there was but we take
15:50 all the good we leave out the bad well
15:53 we swap out all these bad speakers
15:56 coming at us right and we play some
16:00 horrible music what if you said that
16:02 every time you watch leftist things in
16:05 your life if someone's slugging you in
16:07 the face
16:07 you just replace these things that you
16:10 don't want to have in your life because
16:12 you want to control your own mind but
16:14 something that you hate something that's
16:15 very disruptive overly disruptive gets
16:18 compared to just listening to sound
16:19 coming out of a TV okay so let's go to
16:23 punch in the face thing every single
16:25 time you have to read or see or hear
16:27 anything leftist or maybe super EXTREME
16:31 writes on crazy racist nut ball you're
16:34 being punched in the face so you sit at
16:37 the local airports in the United States
16:38 of America almost all of them are left
16:42 you're watching CNN MSNBC so you can
16:47 punch in the face you turn on your
16:50 social media you just want to see how
16:51 your friends are doing maybe there's
16:53 been some wildfires you want to see if
16:55 they're OK you want people to see your
16:57 new baby all this other kind of stuff
16:59 but [ __ ] are posting all this
17:01 political [ __ ] that they have no
17:02 research in most the time and their feet
17:05 so every time you see it it punches you
17:06 in the face
17:08 forget turning on your TV that's going
17:11 to be a one-two-three punch in a couple
17:13 seconds right the ads that run between
17:17 the videos on YouTube can't even control
17:19 that you know I've contemplated turning
17:22 on the skippable ad but I don't want any
17:25 of those [ __ ] ads running in front of
17:28 my videos because they have agendas
17:30 imagine them running an app each Trump
17:32 ad right in front of one of my videos
17:35 they probably run a banner I don't know
17:39 sob sacrificing probably 90% of my
17:43 revenue I could be getting off this
17:44 channel because I can't control the [ __ ]
17:47 running before my videos right so if you
17:52 were to actually think about that first
17:54 split second all these different places
17:56 where you're getting punched in the face
17:57 you're having to watch crap you don't
17:59 want to watch right how much would you
18:04 travel in those circles allow those
18:07 devices to communicate to you stare at
18:09 your phone not that much would you okay
18:15 but a layman might go but mark what's up
18:19 I'm not getting punched in the face
18:20 what's your analogy what's the whole
18:21 point here the point is is that all that
18:24 information goes in your brain and it
18:27 brainwashes you the mind and its most
18:32 simple artificial intelligence / true
18:34 intelligence synaptic Emeka nism it
18:40 takes repetitive imprints of various
18:43 concepts any concept the more goes into
18:47 your brain the more your brain starts
18:50 adopting it as reality that's how we did
18:53 this as little kids this is how we did
18:54 this as whatever we were before we were
18:56 this repetition it starts to get your
19:01 brain to go well I need to accept this
19:03 pattern because it seems to be occurring
19:05 a lot okay so once you have a kernel
19:09 that goes into your brain some single
19:12 concept guns are bad well why are they
19:18 bad oh they're scary and loud and they
19:20 can actually kill you if you're a
19:21 [ __ ] idiot okay once that goes in
19:25 it's a seedling - the other concepts
19:28 that are on that side of the fence and
19:30 so you immediately grow into all this
19:32 other stuff that you may or may not have
19:35 any true interest in until you wake up
19:39 now once you're awake you're usually
19:41 pretty resilient against all this stuff
19:44 aren't you because you immediately
19:45 discern information prior to validating
19:49 in there's repetitive things in this
19:52 world that we hate right someone snoring
19:56 some annoying little tick of your life
20:00 something that's going on or when your
20:02 neighbors gets up at 5:00 in the morning
20:04 every day and plays their stereo for 15
20:06 minutes and their driveway before they
20:07 drive off because I got out the engine
20:09 heat up but you're waking up three hours
20:13 before you need to patterns discerned
20:17 our patterns protected against and filed
20:20 away in a much more intelligent way but
20:24 now think about the fact that most
20:25 people don't have a grasp on reality
20:29 yet it's getting better get much much
20:32 better but they hear the news I mean
20:35 I've got tons of friends that if I were
20:38 just to talk about what's currently and
20:41 you know floating around the Internet as
20:42 the news agenda they will have maybe a
20:45 quarter of a thimbles worth of that news
20:48 in their mind even just the contested
20:51 facts or the real facts they won't know
20:53 what's true or false I get these calls
20:55 every once in a while when there's a lot
20:57 of fear-mongering for my friends who
20:59 actually more left than right they're
21:02 not extremists but they call me up and
21:03 go hey man should I be worried about
21:06 this I think it's I think it's great
21:09 some of these people haven't seen
21:10 physically in four or five years where
21:13 they live in town I mean live in LA but
21:17 when they get completely distraught in
21:18 distress my name comes up in their mind
21:20 boom they're on their phone it's
21:23 actually pretty funny I'm sure you guys
21:26 get the same thing there is no majority
21:30 extremist group anywhere on planet Earth
21:35 it's why they're called extremist groups
21:39 it takes a lot of energy to be an
21:41 extremist it really really does because
21:45 usually it involves a tremendous amount
21:47 of negativity and hate again like I'll
21:50 always tell you guys this should be a
21:53 behavioral mantra you cannot hang on to
21:56 that healthy in a healthy state of mind
22:00 for a long period of time your body
22:02 doesn't want hate it doesn't want pain
22:04 and it will do anything in its power to
22:07 get rid of it but there's a ton at stake
22:11 for these leftists we are actually in a
22:15 group
22:15 we're in actually sorry I should say
22:16 this we're in a situation now where the
22:19 left is specifically calling themselves
22:21 out it's either their way or our way and
22:24 I think that there's three groups that
22:27 are against them left center maybe for
22:31 right and right extremists they're all
22:34 against this left extremists thing well
22:39 now again what's your right extremist
22:41 thing well I
22:42 even know if in America we would
22:45 acknowledge like racism as being a part
22:47 of that it's probably a little tiny sect
22:51 inside the group I mean that's what you
22:53 would call them I guess I would not
22:56 invite them to any political group
22:57 whatsoever they're just racist they're
22:59 way over there but let's just say you've
23:02 got a bunch of like your Nestle CEO who
23:05 says that water is not a right writer at
23:08 waters of privilege and you must buy it
23:10 through a corporation again how that guy
23:14 is still alive to this day I don't know
23:16 your leftist Monsanto it's genetically
23:21 modifying all of your food without
23:22 asking okay I think we can deal with
23:28 that a lot easier with laws statutes
23:32 taxes legal taxes we could just put them
23:37 in a court of law and go hey your food
23:40 kills people put your hands behind your
23:42 back see you same thing with the racists
23:46 who hurts anybody it's a hate crime
23:48 you're out of here boom but you're
23:52 leftists you're super super progressive
23:54 extremist leftists well they go to the
23:58 Eyes Wide Shut parties and they hang out
23:59 with the the other side of the tail some
24:02 of your extreme right is right people as
24:04 well and they are feeding on humans in
24:12 multiple ways they like young people I'm
24:17 gonna harp on this a little bit until we
24:19 really get some closure to this thing
24:21 out there in the public because there's
24:23 only so much that any one leader can do
24:25 anyone might tip military complex can do
24:27 and you want police force and
24:29 what-have-you but they want you to be in
24:32 a state again there's a TED talk about
24:35 it they want pedophilia to be completely
24:40 okay imagine that you have a child it's
24:47 your law lifelong goal maybe several and
24:51 you know how precious a child is it is
24:54 the most precious thing
24:55 in the universe where there'd be a baby
24:57 kitten or baby human it's the most
24:59 precious thing it is the most pristine
25:01 thing it has no prejudice except maybe
25:05 that toy is mine but now you know what's
25:10 interesting is I'm gonna draw quick
25:11 analogy here we typically will have sort
25:15 of extremists in the UFO you'll follow G
25:19 group or it's usually more of your
25:22 science with the capital s folks to talk
25:24 about it your you off ologists are
25:25 actually very cool folks I might want to
25:27 take that back but they'll tell you that
25:29 the aliens that we don't want to show up
25:32 on planet earth are those that would
25:33 enslave us to go dig gold and whatever
25:37 there's all the little statues all over
25:40 Africa that pretty much suggests they
25:44 come to have sex with our women okay
25:47 well think about it right but now what
25:51 would be worse this alien invasion
25:54 slavery to dig gold out of a mine which
25:59 again the stupidest [ __ ] storyline
26:01 ever or human beings that feed on human
26:05 beings simply for pleasure or to tap
26:11 into the Fountain of Youth because
26:13 various organ transplants potentially
26:16 re-energize a human being remember
26:21 Hillary Clinton supposedly died on what
26:27 was it 2016 September 11th when she
26:29 passed out before going into that van
26:32 they said she died technically speaking
26:34 and they were defibrillated her they got
26:36 her back going Russia to her daughter's
26:38 house she crafts herself they put the
26:40 actress out front pretending to be her
26:42 which was the worst impersonation I've
26:44 ever seen in my life
26:47 she then shows up in big body you know
26:51 harnesses unmistakeably gigantic
26:56 apparatus to hold her upright she goes
26:59 off and has a boatload of surgeries now
27:04 she's running around she still looks
27:05 Haggard but if she's ticking in 2020
27:11 you might look into some of these things
27:14 I'm talking about again there was a TED
27:17 talk that went through the profile of a
27:19 pedophile and tried to get the world to
27:24 sympathize and accept their state of
27:27 mind and obviously we need to figure
27:30 this [ __ ] out we need to figure out
27:31 what's going on here we have an
27:34 oversexed society right like when I was
27:37 a kid in the 80s you definitely would
27:41 have the one place in town that has
27:43 those movies in the back and your dad
27:45 might get a me uncle might get him maybe
27:47 and then some son and you know would
27:50 steal them for a little while and guys
27:52 go off and try to figure out the human
27:54 body what the hell we're supposed to be
27:56 doing with a woman by ourselves right
27:58 sometimes it was more confusing but you
28:03 would go see movies like Porky's or
28:06 something so you could see boobies you
28:09 could see something moving around and
28:10 get an idea of how to play this game it
28:12 was you know obviously not the greatest
28:14 source of information but the females
28:17 don't get a manual about how to approach
28:18 the other side and neither do the male's
28:20 right so we're all winging it constantly
28:22 but that's sort of the fun and
28:24 exploration of being a teenager
28:25 beginning your early 20s
28:29 usually in America by the time you're in
28:31 20s you've figured out your technique
28:33 you're gonna continue perfecting it your
28:36 entire life right but in today's world
28:39 and I have no real clue what kids do you
28:43 know with their laptops and their
28:44 bedrooms or their telephones
28:45 what-have-you but we know that for
28:48 whatever deviant act and it's a
28:51 subjective statement of course that
28:54 anyone could do with another human being
28:56 is in triplicate on the Internet up to
28:59 the point of pedophilia now when in the
29:04 eighties there was at least one porn
29:06 star who was having sex at 16 and was
29:08 lying about her age and I've seen those
29:10 videos she look like a grown adult but
29:12 she wasn't she was 16
29:17 she shouldn't be in those films no
29:19 matter what anyway but she seemed like
29:23 she knew what she was doing but how did
29:25 she get there so fast because she
29:28 started really early somehow but what
29:32 destiny did that girl miss because she
29:34 got pigeon-holed in this other thing
29:36 hopefully here life is fantastic I have
29:38 no idea I'd have to look up her her name
29:40 was it was a notorious sort of one-off
29:46 but they are busting these dudes all
29:49 around the world now like crazy
29:52 more during the last two years than the
29:55 last eight years put together well what
29:58 are we finding now nowadays right we're
30:01 finding out that they're in Hollywood
30:07 they make kids movies they say
30:10 unbelievable stuff you read the tweets
30:14 of that gun guy GU and Indu - directed
30:17 guardians of the galaxy you read his
30:18 tweets that he posted and it is
30:22 jaw-dropping the [ __ ] this guy thought
30:25 was appropriate we have comedians that
30:29 run around and hopefully this is going
30:32 to change a little bit now again freedom
30:33 of speech is one thing but I think that
30:39 we have the right to investigate you if
30:41 you are repeatedly making comments about
30:45 committing crimes right if I was a
30:48 comedian for instance and I go up on
30:53 stage and I my whole routine is about
30:55 killing women or something right or
30:58 killing people in general and I'm this
31:01 comedian and I go up and I just make
31:03 literally I tell really funny jokes
31:05 about cornering someone you know holding
31:09 them a gunpoint raping a woman that did
31:11 did to us somehow I make that funny
31:13 right
31:14 obviously I probably couldn't make that
31:16 funny right nobody can wouldn't the cops
31:19 eventually go okay we'd like to know
31:24 where you've been pretty much your whole
31:26 adult life maybe even your adolescent
31:29 life because we have plenty of unsolved
31:31 trees and the towns that you've grown up
31:33 in and you you're talking about killing
31:35 people as some joke first you'd have to
31:39 have a corrupt audience to think that
31:42 that shit's funny right their minds have
31:45 to be just as [ __ ] up as yours to see
31:47 it be funny
31:49 Dane Cook I saw him once at the Melrose
31:52 improv I give you an example he got to a
31:57 point now he was coming in to practice a
31:59 bunch of material because he's about to
32:01 go on the road again and it was funny
32:04 cuz I saw him six months early and he
32:05 was very chunky very heavy ish because
32:08 he's always in tip-top condition and
32:10 then I saw him six months later and he
32:12 was ripped unbelievable so he's in this
32:14 ripped mode he comes in and he warns the
32:17 audience he goes I have a joke I want to
32:19 test it it's inappropriate I'm gonna
32:22 tell you right now it's about rape so
32:24 any of you who think you're gonna have a
32:26 problem with it go the restroom go get a
32:28 drink whatever because I'm gonna tell
32:30 this joke and nobody said a thing no one
32:33 said a thing and his joke was because
32:38 this jokes about rape and he goes don't
32:41 you think at least once in history there
32:45 was love at first sight
32:47 during a rape now such a you know again
32:50 comedy is when you mix two concepts
32:52 together don't belong together so he
32:54 created a perfect joke where your brain
32:56 comes to killing goes haha what that's
32:58 crazy it's disgusting whatever well this
33:02 woman starts yelling at him she says
33:05 that's not funny and he goes well you
33:07 know I sorry I knew that that was gonna
33:09 probably offend someone she goes it
33:11 wasn't funny tonight and it wasn't funny
33:13 last night and he looked at her like
33:15 well then you knew the joke was coming
33:17 because you saw it last night why don't
33:19 you say something I wouldn't have said
33:20 the joke she just continues berating him
33:24 until they threw her and her three
33:26 companions out of the club I got the
33:30 distinct impression that her three
33:31 companions wanted to stay even offered
33:36 her he goes look I'll buy you a drink
33:37 buy a whole table a drink and I will
33:40 tell you any joke and any routine that
33:42 I've ever done in my career
33:45 to say I'm sorry couldn't get out of it
33:50 but now that seemed more like a joke
33:55 then the TED talk that's trying to get
33:58 you to sympathize and empathize with
34:00 people who suffer from pedophilia I'm
34:05 going off on this because there are a
34:08 tremendous amount of these folks that
34:10 are out there bashing the progress that
34:14 we're making in the United States of
34:15 America because they have had according
34:18 to them they've had the sweet ride for
34:22 quite a while now
34:23 right I mean you could only imagine them
34:27 sitting there having coffee with each
34:29 other making phone calls to each other
34:31 probably not phone calls because of the
34:32 sensitive material but they must be
34:34 visiting each other in code you don't
34:36 want to lose your sex slave do you hell
34:39 no man I love my sex slave okay well
34:42 then we got a defeat Donald Trump we
34:43 have to get rid of these guys because
34:45 they're gonna get rid of all of us and
34:47 you know it took us hundreds of years to
34:49 build up this Bohemian Grove boy
34:51 touching Club this NAMBLA boy touching
34:54 Club and we don't want to get rid of it
34:59 button you like your your girl touching
35:03 right your little girl touching you
35:05 don't want to lose that do you hell no
35:06 man
35:07 I'm oh oh how about I say I'll take him
35:09 out back and punch him in the nose and
35:11 then dinero goes well I don't want to
35:13 lose my satan-worshipping as he you know
35:18 tightens the bandaid on the middle left
35:20 finger I'll say the same thing and I'm
35:24 an actor and I believe all these
35:27 fictional characters that I have
35:29 portrayed that that's me I'm a big tough
35:31 guy all five foot six of them
35:34 now obviously perversion is a mental
35:37 illness it is you're off track which you
35:41 should be you're not now there's people
35:45 that there's there are people that find
35:47 themselves on these tracks and they want
35:48 to convince you that it was a natural
35:49 progression maybe it was a natural
35:51 progression based on the information
35:53 that you again took inside from all
35:56 these liberal media outlets that
35:57 basically tell you
35:58 someone did something to someone else
36:00 but it was okay right how many times you
36:03 see these college kids that have raped
36:04 somebody on campus like savagely not
36:08 some dispute of like I really regret
36:11 sleeping with this person the next day
36:12 thing and they get like approbation
36:15 sometimes they kill these people they
36:17 get like three years probation no time
36:18 off well every single time something
36:21 like that occurs it sends a signal to
36:24 the public you can get away with this
36:27 that's why I think that the laws that
36:30 govern against some of these things the
36:33 sentencing being so variant is very
36:38 dangerous because you can have a guy who
36:41 you could have a black guy who steals a
36:44 pack of cigarettes in Texas you'll get a
36:46 hundred and ten years in prison whereas
36:49 the same black guy steals a packet of
36:51 cigarettes and doesn't even get
36:54 probation in Chicago or Philly there's a
36:59 racist bias there that's creating these
37:01 ridiculous sentences now the guy that
37:03 got that hundred ten years I believe he
37:05 got that 20 years ago or so but it
37:09 shouldn't happen like that in my opinion
37:11 we know that Hollywood is greatly
37:13 controlled by a lot of these individuals
37:16 and there's a lot of good people in
37:17 Hollywood as well trying to wake the
37:20 system up sneak scripts in with little
37:22 agendas to help people discern and think
37:26 but how many bad ones do you need to get
37:28 you know a billion dollars worth of box
37:32 office sales just a few a year maybe one
37:36 a year if everybody has to have that
37:38 movie in they're downloading stream then
37:41 it's got a big bad message in it well
37:44 then mission accomplished right maybe
37:45 you simply worship the people that
37:47 created the film and you find out that
37:49 they're into all this wacky stuff and
37:51 because they managed to output a product
37:54 that you worship inadvertently you start
37:58 accepting their way you know there are
38:02 movie stars who have been accused of you
38:04 know pushing 14 year old kids down in
38:06 beds at night trying to force themselves
38:09 on them but now some might be a
38:12 huge fan of that movie star loves
38:15 everything that they do perhaps they're
38:17 addicted to their series on Netflix and
38:19 they're like oh my god oh I got to have
38:20 the last season with that actor in it I
38:22 can't have them disappear out of the
38:24 program and so they will root for the
38:29 actor to get away with a crime so they
38:31 can have a little product but the actor
38:35 creates a lot of them are unwilling to
38:38 process the facts they're unwilling to
38:39 look at the accusations all this is
38:44 conditioning in the mind every time
38:46 these guys get away I've done the
38:48 everything gets soft peddled right they
38:51 buy off a judge it still happens every
38:54 day people every freaking day
38:57 in 2016 it was an there was an amazing
39:00 awakening and that they were supposed to
39:03 be a bunch of protests right
39:05 it happened in 17 as well I'm here in
39:08 Los Angeles right and I used to have a
39:11 startup that I was creating that was in
39:14 kind of the Marina del Rey area I set
39:18 the drive there three or four times a
39:20 week and driving home I go under all the
39:22 under pat overpasses the people and
39:24 pedestrians walked through which is
39:26 where these george soros funded
39:28 craigslist funded protests were you know
39:31 rumored to have been going on and again
39:33 if you turn on the the leftist media
39:35 they'll tell you that millions of people
39:37 have hit the street in los angeles and
39:38 then you drive home and you realize well
39:42 they can't even fill up a tenth of the
39:46 overpass you got four or five people out
39:49 there holding signs of what you can't
39:50 read because they're so far away right
39:52 the last round of protests in LA really
39:56 brought to the forefront for me this
39:58 episode and then it's all fake it's all
40:01 fake right these people are scumbags
40:03 that will actually take money for from a
40:05 craigslist post and protest the very
40:09 fabric of the country that gave them the
40:11 right to do that what does any group
40:14 want in the end they want their way
40:17 right we all do well when you're a
40:20 centralist
40:21 aka Republic aka a constitutionalists
40:26 right what you want is a world where it
40:30 is based on do no harm common law which
40:36 means I don't mess with you you don't
40:37 mess with me your government doesn't
40:39 mess with you your local state and
40:41 federal governments don't mess with you
40:42 there's no agency out there coming to
40:45 take away the units of money that you
40:48 earn by working unless you agree to it
40:53 you're more than welcome to volunteer
40:55 your cash into your country but you want
40:58 to wake up and essentially have these
40:59 rules decided on and go boom at least
41:02 it's illegal to mess with me and in by
41:05 proxy it's illegal for me to mess with
41:07 someone else that has value well what if
41:12 you woke up and you lived in a predators
41:16 world but these left progressive
41:20 progressives have absolutely built into
41:25 society
41:26 meaning they get their way there's no
41:27 more debate anymore they win well they
41:33 can come and grab your kids your
41:36 neighbor could have captured your child
41:38 out of the front yard out of the back
41:40 yard snuck in through your child's back
41:42 window either in their bedroom or
41:45 dragging them out to their house they
41:46 could have sex with them yeah you know
41:51 if they die in the process well wasn't
41:53 my intention you knows what they think
41:56 but they make that okay although they're
42:02 Luciferian worshiping right again I'm
42:05 not a Christian I don't think Jesus
42:06 existed but it doesn't matter if someone
42:09 else thinks that all that's true and
42:11 they decide to go with Lucifer side I
42:15 should say saying now Lucifer but they
42:20 want to go to this devil worshipping
42:21 sign well the true worshipping mechanism
42:26 of devil worshipping is human sacrifice
42:29 sometimes is full-on death sometimes
42:31 it's rape sometimes it's torture but
42:34 it's nothing that adheres to common-law
42:37 right
42:39 this is what we're up against right when
42:43 you turn on CNN and you see all these
42:46 folks with no facts constantly going on
42:50 about Russian collusion and racism and
42:53 all this [ __ ] they want to waste
42:56 millions of our dollars going through an
42:59 exercise of impeachment that we'll never
43:01 get a two-thirds majority by the Senate
43:04 that's what they're for wasting your
43:07 time wasting your hard-earned money
43:09 this is your money well they're rich
43:11 they don't care right and they got rich
43:15 this is the kicker they got rich by
43:18 selling you all this deviant [ __ ] such
43:23 that you will one day accept it as
43:25 normality hmm well if I said I had a
43:31 special ray gun right remember the one
43:33 then in men and black will they flash
43:35 your face and you forget everything for
43:37 X number of time they dial it in right
43:41 well what if I have one of those that
43:43 had the indoctrination of the left
43:46 progressives other st. luring their
43:49 pedophilia right there into corporate
43:52 greed and so is the other side of the
43:53 fence right way over on the right
43:55 extremists they're into corporate greed
43:56 at least they're at these same parties
43:58 with these pedophiles and all this
43:59 craziness right but again no one's
44:02 really at this point in time no one's
44:04 peddling that crap to the American
44:06 people right now it's all a leftist
44:07 thing we don't have you know six out of
44:10 six major news arteries going extremists
44:13 right they're going extremists left and
44:15 have been for a long time
44:16 again there's movie after movie out of
44:19 all of the networks that are you know
44:22 subscription cable services but that
44:25 that pump this stuff day and night right
44:30 but you wake up and they've won and all
44:33 this is normal what kind of life you're
44:37 gonna live how important it is to you
44:39 that you never live in that particular
44:41 life now someone might be hiding some
44:46 mental illness that they're having you
44:48 know for whatever reason everything came
44:51 together the Rubies key
44:52 solved in the wrong way and they are
44:54 going towards at least some sort of
44:57 pedophilia or something they're not
45:00 gonna walk in the room and tell you I'm
45:03 willing to bet unless they go to NAMBLA
45:05 and that's what you're supposed to be
45:07 talked about but if turning on the news
45:09 all the time was this little secret
45:11 instrument but the more that this
45:13 pattern is pushed into your head pushed
45:15 into your head pushed in your head
45:16 eventually you start to accept it as
45:20 reality I tell you this before you ever
45:22 experience the instrument and I go well
45:24 now I got these special like they live
45:26 glasses you can put on that will reflect
45:28 that particular signal away from you
45:32 protect you make you immune from it and
45:35 so you're wearing these glasses all the
45:37 time because you don't want to be
45:38 programmed well unfortunately those
45:41 glasses don't exist
45:42 and unfortunately everywhere you go in
45:45 the modern society of America you're
45:48 being inundated with this message
45:50 anytime you turn on streaming services
45:53 on your telephone let me know saw it on
45:55 your TV or your telephone or whatever a
45:58 lot of movies a lot of made for a
46:03 particular Network film some original
46:06 series has this stuff embedded in it
46:10 it's very controversial what Netflix had
46:14 one where two girls I guess masturbated
46:17 who were minors at the beginning of the
46:19 show well then it we got publicized in
46:22 all the news as this huge controversy
46:25 that these girls were masturbating at
46:27 this beginning of this series well you
46:31 don't think the marketing firm of that
46:32 show the producers of that show didn't
46:35 absolutely love that publicity because
46:39 now it's a forbidden fruit and what do
46:40 we do in this modern society we consume
46:42 forbidden fruits that's what it's all
46:45 about isn't it but it's desensitizing us
46:49 to all of these things that in most
46:52 cases we would give our lives to prevent
46:54 from ever happening to our own loved
46:56 ones it's such a big deal this mental
47:00 illness that's going our going around in
47:02 all these different categories the
47:04 nobody wants to ever it
47:06 meant that they have these issues and so
47:09 they don't ask for help some people have
47:11 been known to kill themselves take their
47:12 own lives because they can't stop it you
47:14 know even in the fictional book of the
47:18 New Testament in my opinion Paul talked
47:20 about the thorn in his side and because
47:25 in Romans right my preacher back in the
47:28 day said that some people think it was
47:30 homosexuality was the thorn in his side
47:33 I have no idea maybe it was pedophilia
47:39 never know we don't have mechanism to
47:44 help these people but again when this
47:50 stuff is in a lot of shows on TV and
47:54 movies that are exist out there if we
47:57 want to get rid of the systemic cause of
48:00 this problem well where would we look I
48:04 mean wouldn't we get a council of people
48:06 together psychologists and psychiatrists
48:09 and doctors and behavior lists and get
48:13 together and say well what what would
48:16 what have we been able to get out of
48:17 people that have been willing to admit
48:21 to this or have been caught and
48:22 sentenced in prison and you talked to
48:24 them and they tell you what's going on
48:26 and how it all progressed with them is
48:28 there some pattern for how all this
48:30 stuff gets started we know that and I
48:34 can tell you from personal experience I
48:36 had one friend in high school raised
48:38 Christian went into his rebellious phase
48:41 wasn't quite knocking it out with ladies
48:44 the way he wanted to needed to lash out
48:48 and he became a saint worshipper for at
48:51 least a year
48:51 and it was just everybody knew and it
48:54 was silly but he was conducting rituals
48:56 with fire I mean it was like he was into
48:59 it man then he found a girl and got born
49:03 again
49:04 now he's mega Christian all right
49:07 there's a case study for that guy on how
49:10 a person moves over to Satanism
49:16 but there are people that children that
49:18 are raised by Satanists who had the
49:21 initial bizarre introduction to turn to
49:24 flip to hate everybody right usually
49:26 like can't stand Christians so I'm going
49:28 to go ahead and go for this other
49:29 doctrine that persecutes them again read
49:34 a fictional book and they get all upset
49:35 and destroy your life right crazy that's
49:39 why it's dangerous but they'll raise
49:43 their kids directly into it and
49:44 therefore their kids man it's completely
49:47 normal
49:47 it's completely normal well of course we
49:49 do this why wouldn't you want to do this
49:50 this is the way it works I think that
49:54 the the notion that the progressive left
49:56 is a large group and that it's risen up
49:58 is fake
50:02 these antifa kids that run around with
50:05 masks on their face well why do they
50:07 have masks on their face they don't stop
50:10 and take interviews do they have you
50:12 ever thought for a second that maybe
50:14 those kids have been flown in from
50:15 another country they don't give a [ __ ]
50:18 about America to begin with they're not
50:20 students from Berkeley they're just kids
50:24 now of course there are kids in this
50:27 country that do it they do gang stalking
50:30 on the Internet right is that the world
50:33 you want to live in the simplest
50:35 solutions are usually the best solutions
50:38 right you know this for a fact
50:41 less is usually more in this world a lot
50:46 of times I see people that are really
50:48 uptight you know very high-strung people
50:51 and I'll tell you the key if you're one
50:54 of these people or you know some someone
50:56 like this the sort of unsung cause or I
51:01 should say mantra in their brain that I
51:03 discover in them and usually can get
51:05 them to relax if I can spend some time
51:06 with them is that they believe that
51:08 there's something that they're supposed
51:09 to be doing that they don't really have
51:12 to do the high strung my kind of my
51:15 aren't I supposed to be doing this isn't
51:17 everyone else doing this why turn this
51:19 on and these people look like me and
51:21 they're they're bizarre like me or
51:24 whatever it's their own judgment on that
51:25 case
51:27 and they're doing this thing they fell
51:29 victim to this movement this group and
51:32 so they try to join the group and they
51:35 find out that these people are also
51:37 high-strung and so they think they found
51:40 their own clan now the only commonality
51:44 that they really have is that everybody
51:45 in that group is completely [ __ ] lost
51:47 they have no agenda in life they don't
51:49 have an education that gives them a
51:51 dream to go do something that will
51:53 enrich themselves enrich the world they
51:56 never learned how to play an instrument
51:58 they never learn anything artistic they
51:59 don't have any mathematical talent you
52:02 know maybe they know how to draw a
52:03 picture and your [ __ ] froth in your
52:05 coffee that's about it in some cases and
52:10 so they get together a disenfranchised
52:11 lost group and they really don't have
52:15 any creativity to come up with an agenda
52:17 so they're just together a group that is
52:21 lost that needs a lot of mentorship a
52:23 lot of support from the rest of us
52:24 and sadly because we frown on the book
52:27 covers too much right they don't help
52:29 these people we don't talk to them at
52:31 parties or in public because we feel
52:33 like they are awkward right the first
52:36 people I talked to at the party my
52:40 entire life I've loved they judge the
52:42 book by the cover formula god damn it I
52:45 love it you want to look a little bit
52:47 different than the rest of the people
52:49 it's great because they judge you and a
52:53 lot of people probably the majority of
52:54 people 51% judge you and they don't have
52:56 a chance to interact with you and so
52:57 they move on with their life having
52:59 judged you but the other 49% get a
53:03 chance to talk to you you all start a
53:04 conversation with them or whatever I'm
53:06 standing with someone who's very legit
53:08 and so who the hell is this guy oh he's
53:09 this dude you know you should talk to
53:11 him you'll have some good conversations
53:13 and all the sudden you're like oh my god
53:14 people long hair can have brains mm-hmm
53:17 sure can I can wear biker boots and
53:20 drive really nice cars it's totally cool
53:23 and so that breaks down their barrier
53:26 towards the isolationism that creates
53:29 these groups so you have this whole
53:32 group of people that are lost and then
53:34 what happens what happens what are they
53:36 searching for they're searching for a
53:38 cause
53:40 well here comes the Democratic Party
53:43 right with their taco truck votes as
53:46 they say well they really love the
53:49 Mexican population don't they believe
53:52 Hillary Clinton is on record as having
53:54 called blacks the worst things on planet
53:56 Earth oh but cheesier she's got her
54:00 barbecue sauce in her purse does she's
54:04 all about your people mm-hmm but they
54:08 hatch these agendas with massive plans
54:11 right they fund them and they find these
54:14 groups and they fund them and they
54:16 indoctrinate them and tell them what
54:18 they live for and these groups are just
54:20 so suggestible because the one thing
54:24 they want is a purpose that they can
54:25 they can't figure it out they have no
54:27 money to have a purpose so they'll go
54:30 and sometimes they volunteer to run you
54:33 know Dean DNC campaigns completely ill
54:37 informed about the Constitution of the
54:39 United States globalism nationalism
54:41 economics military their history is all
54:45 the officials do official news history
54:48 they worship everything that Anderson
54:51 Cooper says and so they become
54:55 intellectual ignorant mercenaries don't
54:57 think they've researched nothing know
55:02 everything stand out in protest until
55:04 someone puts a microphone on their face
55:05 and says tell me your claim again about
55:09 how Donald Trump is remove rights from
55:11 LGBT people or well not isn't there
55:15 something you say something oh gosh
55:17 we'll [ __ ] you and they spit in your
55:19 face right because you called their
55:23 bluff you prove beyond the shadow of a
55:25 doubt they have no [ __ ] clue what
55:27 they're talking about
55:29 hmm but you're the bad guy for knowing
55:33 so what I want to impart on you and you
55:38 know again I'm technically trying to
55:41 convince you of something so be aware of
55:43 this this is my opinion but I think it's
55:46 very very true and that is that this
55:48 extreme leftist thing that's going on
55:51 has been utterly magnified
55:54 just like an ant with a big giant lens
55:57 all right in a nice controlled
55:59 environment so he doesn't get sizzled by
56:00 the light but they've magnified this
56:03 microscopic virus that we have around
56:05 the world to make you think that this is
56:07 the norm so there's sort of if you're
56:10 disenfranchised you're lost whatever or
56:12 both or all the above and some more
56:14 you'll flip over well what's gonna
56:18 happen right let's go back to Stanley
56:21 Kubrick an Eyes Wide Shut 45 minutes of
56:24 the movie cut out because it was all
56:26 about the actual intensity of the
56:29 parties and what actually occurs god
56:31 knows what the hell he might have shot
56:32 I'd love to know the original script
56:36 again he dies shortly after making that
56:38 film like he was 70 very young you've
56:44 joined this group at a low level of the
56:48 Pyramid of control you think you're part
56:50 of a group and you think that the people
56:52 that sent you those $15 an hour
56:55 paychecks through Craigslist care about
56:57 you you think they care about LGBT you
57:02 think they care about black people or
57:03 Mexican immigration oh they don't give a
57:06 [ __ ] about any of you guys them they
57:10 don't care it was all full exploitation
57:15 100% and when you need something when
57:20 you really need those social programs to
57:22 pay off well if they need to advance the
57:25 agenda to because they haven't gotten
57:26 the control apparatus completely wrapped
57:28 around the world and some chastity belt
57:31 of zero freedom right then maybe you'll
57:35 get a few more checks in the mail but
57:38 the second Vega control the second they
57:42 get the laws passed and the second that
57:44 they have the overwhelming majority of
57:46 this planet believing they're psychotic
57:48 [ __ ] mental ill mind [ __ ] you will
57:54 never feel more like cattle going to the
57:57 slaughter than the moment after that
57:59 occurs the cool thing about the American
58:03 dream as it currently exists and is you
58:07 know holding on
58:08 for dear life as our second amendment
58:10 creates a big checks and balances with
58:14 our government again as I told you in
58:18 the previous episode the soldiers once
58:20 they get told to take away guns you're
58:24 gonna have a lot of epiphanies for the
58:26 controlling elite it won't go as they
58:28 think it will which is why they never
58:30 have tried to do it
58:31 but believe me they're trying to
58:32 indoctrinate soldiers into believing
58:35 that these m16s are only for them to go
58:38 kill people they don't know anything
58:40 about and feel justified about it while
58:42 people at home are supposed to have
58:45 anything right it's not working but
58:48 they're trying to but the second that
58:53 guns disappear out of the United States
58:54 of America the world is [ __ ] I said
58:59 this in my gun control episode way back
59:01 in season 1 and you need to hear it
59:03 again the reason why the world has
59:06 maintained any level of sovereignty and
59:08 I know some people hate to hear this it
59:10 would be the case if your country has
59:12 guns and there's some European countries
59:14 that allow not only guns but they want
59:16 everyone to own one and carry one so
59:19 you're part of the group too but if they
59:23 wanted to put the whole EU conglomerate
59:28 into some tyranny base thx 1-1 3-8 world
59:32 America would come eventually and
59:36 liberate Europe and everyone in Europe
59:39 will have learned their lesson the hard
59:41 way they will have lived years in this
59:45 tyranny before we're able to come over
59:46 and give it back
59:48 you know give you back sovereignty so
59:52 they don't try it but the second we
59:55 can't do a goddamn thing in this country
59:57 the whole place transforms in terms of
60:00 history in terms of the lifespan of Homo
60:03 sapiens they've been on this planet it
60:04 will happen in a flash instantaneous man
60:09 imagine a world where everything that
60:11 you think is bad becomes good and
60:14 everything you think is good becomes bad
60:16 you want your sovereign rights that's
60:19 bad you want to be left alone
60:21 that's bad you don't want your kids
60:25 taken from you well that's now good you
60:28 don't want to be beaten over by a big
60:31 stick simply because someone wants
60:33 something that you have or because they
60:34 just had a bad day
60:35 well that was bad and now it's good at
60:39 some point the reason why I mentioned
60:41 the kubrik thing a second ago what would
60:45 stop the group this disfranchise who
60:48 helps this agenda go through being
60:51 invited to one of those parties and you
60:52 think that you've won for some liberal
60:54 thing me and there's no more nation
60:56 borders there's no more guns I started
60:58 to fear something I don't know anything
60:59 about don't know anything about history
61:01 so we're here we are gonna repeat it in
61:03 a huge way and just like so many people
61:06 I think Prince and Stanley Kubrick both
61:09 have the same experience they're invited
61:11 to a party they go and the party turns
61:16 out to be one of those parties it could
61:18 be just a sex fest party that they want
61:20 they don't want to have anything to do
61:21 with but it could be the party that
61:23 Prince alluded to and that they can
61:27 Jelena Jolie in a videotaped confession
61:30 she was just with some friends and some
61:33 living room and she starts talking about
61:34 how they made her kill bunch of animals
61:36 and they were drinking the blood out of
61:37 the animals prince talked about drinking
61:39 squirrels blood and one of his songs on
61:41 the Black Album okay
61:43 so you're at one of those parties are
61:47 you going to convince yourself the
61:49 insanity that you're experiencing is
61:51 somehow good we're gonna try to get away
61:53 oh but you got rid of all of the ability
61:56 for you to be safe there's no way for
61:58 you to get away so now you're stuck in
62:01 the system and regardless if the entire
62:03 world is doing it you actually don't
62:06 believe on the inside that it's truly a
62:09 good thing to do maybe you're like me
62:12 and you don't think Christ existed but
62:14 it doesn't mean that you don't know
62:15 right from wrong it doesn't mean you
62:18 don't think God exists and that you're
62:20 gonna be answering to some higher source
62:22 but just think about this if what we
62:26 suspect about the soul and I just heard
62:29 a great bunch of [ __ ] this woman did
62:32 a great video she was great she did a
62:35 video on all of
62:36 the sort of faux science around the
62:38 brain and a bunch of science what
62:41 they're trying to you know alter the
62:42 human body to think a certain way and
62:43 what have you and I think you could
62:44 probably do that because again you're
62:46 injuring the vessel by which the soul
62:47 pushes through
62:48 but if Souls exist and they don't have
62:52 any mechanism to hide in the universe
62:54 because how could you hide it where's it
62:56 gonna go and all you had in terms of
62:59 your accountability after death is
63:00 simply answering to the folks that you
63:04 harmed
63:04 oh sure maybe there's some big well you
63:09 know I had a weird path and if I hadn't
63:11 have been born this way with these
63:13 parents and these thyroid problems and
63:15 ba Papa then I would have never gotten
63:17 to that I would have never touched you
63:19 it's really strange I'm sorry I touched
63:20 you you know but someone might just go
63:24 but did you know it was wrong well yeah
63:28 I did well then why'd you do it I don't
63:32 know
63:33 I didn't research anything but I knew
63:35 everything so how do we stop this well I
63:40 think most of you already know if you're
63:42 a longtime viewer you definitely already
63:44 know you have to cut off the image
63:46 machine you have to cut these things out
63:49 of your life if you happen to see
63:51 something it was some friends you're
63:53 watching the latest popular series on
63:55 Netflix or HBO or Hulu or whatever and
63:58 you start seeing this stuff you're
64:01 immediately resisting its filing into
64:03 okay alright in your brain you're going
64:05 holy [ __ ]
64:06 let's look up who produced this show who
64:08 wrote it
64:09 you know let's hook up the background
64:11 maybe accusations towards these actors
64:13 do these actors have sexual harassment
64:15 cases against them pedophile charges
64:17 against and that they we don't know but
64:19 they were charged with this and they got
64:20 away with it scot-free I mean anyone
64:25 looking up the tweets of that dude man
64:28 Wow
64:29 you'd be mortified the fact that this
64:33 guy was abled I mean if if I had
64:35 accidentally followed this gun guy who
64:38 made guardians of the galaxy again it
64:41 was a great first movie second movie was
64:42 [ __ ] ridiculous but whatever first
64:44 one was good let's see I just became a
64:46 fan I'm a centralist
64:48 and I join his Twitter account because I
64:52 gave a [ __ ] which I don't and I see you
64:54 know he had a joke about the movie was
64:57 so boring and he was watching that he
64:59 [ __ ] the kid next to him
65:01 that's a tweet from the sky and that's
65:03 one of his more mild tweets to the
65:06 public this guy is so into this and most
65:11 likely does this to a level that he
65:14 tweeted it to the world because he
65:16 thought that he's got so much
65:20 camaraderie and defensive people that
65:23 are in power that defend this behavior
65:25 the cops will come after him his boss
65:27 won't come after him imagine me saying a
65:30 bunch of Pro pedophilia [ __ ] on this
65:33 show what would it take to get me
65:35 ostracized from society for never being
65:38 employed again apparently it's not so
65:41 goddamn easy you can say anything one of
65:46 my family members is actually more than
65:48 one at least a couple are extreme well
65:51 they're they're damn near progressive
65:53 leftists almost they got a couple of
65:56 toes in that area I mentioned you know
66:00 all these people that are threatened to
66:01 kill the president Kathy Griffin and her
66:04 holding up
66:05 you know Trump's head bloodied and all
66:08 this other stuff and their reply was
66:11 laughing and saying well they're
66:15 comedians they're musicians they're
66:18 expressing themselves or or mainly the
66:21 comedian's you know so these felonies
66:23 are threatening the president's life are
66:26 all the sudden not felonies because
66:27 these people have leftist [ __ ]
66:30 platforms to step on hmm really
66:34 but what stops someone from being racist
66:37 as a comedian I mean really her tea
66:42 racism racism Richard Pryor talked about
66:45 racism talked about it and made it funny
66:50 but his thing was look at what you white
66:53 folks do this is what black folks do
66:55 we're pretty much dead even for there
66:58 are oddities and now let's get along
66:59 because now you understand us a little
67:01 bit better
67:02 and just know that we think of you like
67:04 this so if you're not like that you need
67:06 to change your behavior but he was
67:09 talking from experience wasn't he
67:11 so we have to cut these are to resolve
67:14 and a huge way but how do you cut it off
67:17 when you go to an airport I travel at
67:20 times a lot okay and I will go in these
67:24 airports and there will be liberal
67:28 bookstores by the one of the fake news
67:32 organizations out there go figure
67:35 when I go to buy a candy bar or some
67:37 water or something I typically don't
67:38 give them any of my money when I walk
67:41 through the store
67:42 cuz I'm bored to death got a two-hour
67:44 layover whatever you know stormy Daniels
67:47 book is in there stormy Daniels is a
67:51 [ __ ] hero to the left right
67:53 she is a porn star and a prostitute I've
67:59 I've seen her dance at strip clubs
68:03 online right hmm
68:06 now we all know some great people who
68:09 were involved in some of those things
68:10 right I actually helped full disclosure
68:13 in the nineties before I was awake and I
68:17 would I don't know if I'd do it as an
68:19 older person but I was in my 20s and I
68:21 met online a couple female porn stars
68:25 and they needed internet help and so I
68:28 did some makeovers for some of them
68:31 heard some amazing stories about how
68:34 they got into that usually always one of
68:36 them always one of them told me that she
68:38 was absolutely always high every single
68:41 time she did a film and they got her
68:43 addicted to this stuff for free and then
68:44 she had to swap half of her pay for her
68:47 supply and it just got really bad one
68:50 was still in it one was out but she
68:53 still was trying to survive off her
68:54 assets selling you know some 29.9 $29
68:59 subscription to see her old stuff but
69:02 she hated it
69:02 that was their only way of making an
69:04 income at the time
69:06 I have frequented it in my mid-20s once
69:09 trip are I probably been to one strip
69:11 bar my entire life it's really funny
69:13 didn't know it was I was being tricked
69:15 to my birthday that's the first time I
69:17 went there but then I started going even
69:20 dated one of the girls so I'm not trying
69:25 to you know cast disparaging remarks or
69:28 negativity on these individuals that
69:29 find themselves in these situations but
69:32 in all cases there was pain with these
69:35 careers they like the money they don't
69:38 like the typically what it made them and
69:40 typically most of girls had a temporary
69:42 career in that stuff they had greater
69:45 aspirations but again I think we are
69:50 overly sensitive about the human body in
69:52 America were ashamed of our form which i
69:54 think is a very sad fact but turning
69:57 yourself into you know a piece of meat
69:59 for a bunch of people to purchase that's
70:01 a little bit different than just saying
70:03 aren't I beautiful don't you want to
70:05 look but again I was perverted as a
70:08 young kid oversexed you know too much
70:12 too much access to pornographic material
70:17 videos magazines all that kind of stuff
70:19 and it took me up into my 30s to really
70:24 go wait a minute wait a minute is this
70:26 who I want to be because this stuff is
70:29 programming in my brain I thank God I
70:31 have a very strong brain but you know I
70:34 can I could I would I would bet that if
70:38 I had like again the the truth meter box
70:42 that there are things that I started to
70:45 prefer in my personal life that were
70:48 indoctrinated into me by these sources
70:50 that had nothing to do with the average
70:52 psyche of a woman right that's one of
70:56 the giant dangers of that material I
70:59 think it's interesting that a lot of us
71:01 have at least at one point in our life
71:03 I'm definitely guilty of this we have
71:05 standards about some things and no
71:08 standards about other things example you
71:12 might be a person who jogs runs every
71:16 day you go to CrossFit and you eat pure
71:18 organic stuff to the best
71:20 of your ability you're picky about your
71:21 food at restaurants you only go to good
71:23 restaurants very meticulous with your
71:25 life you look like a million bucks but
71:29 when it comes to doctrine aiding
71:32 yourself online yeah
71:34 watching stuff that's crazy you know
71:36 playing season seven of Walking Dead in
71:40 a living room with your kids walking
71:41 around there's no standards at all or
71:45 are you willing to bend the standards
71:46 because you've personally become
71:48 addicted to something else
71:49 and I have to say it's really a shame
71:52 for instance and again I harp on this
71:54 every once in a while but it's amazing
71:56 you know some of you guys haven't seen
71:59 the comments of other people but I have
72:01 had dozens and dozens of private
72:04 messages about my comments long time ago
72:07 about walking dead season seven episode
72:10 one where they murder one of their
72:13 people and probably the most gruesome
72:15 thing I've ever seen in any fictional
72:17 portrayal and either film or television
72:20 and at that point I here was very
72:23 addicted to the show I thought the
72:26 writing was great the casting was great
72:28 they were able to take this this thing
72:30 of zombies popping up and killing one of
72:33 them off every once in a while and the
72:34 struggles of humanity and do amazing job
72:37 running this show and then they had to
72:38 do that one episode this big
72:41 shock-and-awe episode they liked that
72:43 controverse they'd loved every bit of it
72:45 everybody's saying they hated the show
72:47 they loved it as it was controversy put
72:51 him on the front page now the reality of
72:53 the situation was they're making a great
72:55 series and they didn't need to do that
72:56 just continue writing a great series and
72:59 everyone's gonna continue watching but I
73:02 never watched another episode of that
73:04 show my mind strong enough I just went
73:07 mm-hmm you're not gonna get my Nielsen
73:10 ratings or whatever my download
73:13 streaming ratings I think I even
73:16 subscribed to was AMC so I could stream
73:19 this thing I kept cable around or
73:21 something just so I can see it all the
73:23 canceled gone done don't want to be
73:26 programmed with that kind of [ __ ]
73:28 and I've seen online things 50,000 times
73:32 more serious than those fictional things
73:34 have seen the real thing online but if
73:38 somebody says to you oh my god do you
73:41 can you you know did you hear what
73:43 happened this protest group and they did
73:47 all their you know and Tifa stuff or
73:49 whatever is bothering you from the left
73:53 side of the game just remind people that
73:56 it's not what it looks like it's a teeny
73:59 tiny microscopic group that's been
74:01 magnified by the press I don't
74:05 understand why America isn't completely
74:08 I can say is like baffled angered and
74:14 coming to a point a call a call of
74:18 action right a call to action excuse me
74:20 about the fact that all of our press in
74:23 this country is left again Fox is kind
74:27 of just right in between right typically
74:32 the the spokesman for Fox are very right
74:35 either center to right but their
74:38 articles are right to extreme left it's
74:42 interesting of course all of them
74:44 monetize shootings they monetize death
74:49 all over the world
74:50 right and and some of us you know who
74:53 knows right like they'll tell you that a
74:55 bus went over a cliff in some foreign
74:59 country and that everybody on the bus
75:01 died and they'll run that as a big
75:04 article well the chances are that no one
75:09 you know was on that bus it doesn't mean
75:13 you don't care about their well-being
75:14 but you know that every single day every
75:16 single second while I've made this
75:17 episode a ton of people have died in
75:19 accidents and you know this is the case
75:22 because we have seven and a half billion
75:24 headed towards eight billion people on
75:25 this planet do you really want to sit
75:29 around and watch a news feed of
75:30 everything horrible in the world
75:32 what's that gonna do for you personally
75:35 I would wager bum at your day quite a
75:39 bit unless you're some Satanist who's
75:42 thinking you're harvesting their energy
75:44 or solar or whatever but it's in every
75:47 feed because it creates a big spike it
75:51 creates some interest oh let's go see a
75:53 gory photograph boom if you believe in a
75:56 left and right paradigm okay which up
75:58 until I think 2016 you know I think it's
76:02 still fake quite frankly I think we have
76:04 a centralist administration in America
76:07 today very simple follow the
76:09 Constitution once we get that figured
76:11 out how to do that well then we'll go
76:14 after everything else right the meantime
76:16 again they're wrapping up all these
76:17 pedophiles online it's great child
76:19 traffickers all around the world lots of
76:23 magical suicides going on right
76:25 I mean there's two types of suicides
76:27 going on right now people who are who
76:31 know too much are being murdered and
76:33 people who believe they're going to get
76:36 prosecuted either get caught and
76:39 executed by the law secretly or there
76:44 are truly committing suicide or
76:45 disappearing under the cover of suicide
76:48 such that they never see the inside of a
76:51 jail cell or lethal injection that
76:57 should give you an idea of the severity
76:59 of the crimes that these people have
77:01 committed and that they are worried
77:03 about getting caught doing let's say
77:06 you're a parent you're like okay I can
77:08 control myself I can can turn off the TV
77:10 never play it at home control what my
77:13 kids see while they're home but my kid
77:16 has a telephone you know as much as
77:19 there's parental controls on telephones
77:21 you know as a parent there's very little
77:23 you can do to stop your kids from seeing
77:25 what they want to see their friends have
77:27 phones but there's a way around it most
77:32 parents don't get involved because it's
77:33 a bunch of techie [ __ ] turning on
77:36 parental controls I just turned on oh my
77:40 I have one of these Alexa things right I
77:43 got give it to me for Christmas I just
77:45 use it as a clock and a alarm clock and
77:48 that kind of thing right but one time I
77:50 learned that it tells stories so I was
77:52 just saying I read this article says hey
77:55 it tells kids stories that
77:56 I was like oh this is cool let me find
77:58 out how good this is so I said tell me a
77:59 story I had to go turn on a bunch of
78:02 crap
78:03 parental [ __ ] just to get this thing to
78:05 tell me a bedtime story are you kidding
78:08 me right
78:09 serious I just did it that one night I
78:12 don't have him tell me bedtime stories
78:13 at night maybe I should but what do what
78:17 are the some of the byproducts that kids
78:19 are some of the products that kids
78:21 consume like religiously well music is a
78:25 huge one mmm well you've got a ton of
78:29 musicians right the ones with real
78:32 talent they write their own lyrics and
78:34 write their own music they usually tell
78:36 fantastic stories you're sort of Rage
78:38 Against the Machine kind of bands that
78:40 that know what's going on but then you
78:42 have the bands that can't write their
78:43 own music can't write lyrics but they
78:45 look pretty and they can kind of pull it
78:47 off on stage and so the record companies
78:51 come in and purchase the music for them
78:53 purchase the lyrics for them perhaps
78:56 they can write the music but they can't
78:57 write the lyrics like Elton John right
78:59 well we've got Lady Gaga hanging out
79:04 with the spirit cooking lady
79:06 we got Katy Perry showing up the party's
79:09 dressed like Satan is a Christian girl
79:13 from Orange County first hit song was a
79:15 kissed a girl and I liked it okay and
79:18 there's thousands of them right Kanye
79:23 West so shows a moment of lucidity and
79:27 what do they do they stick him in a
79:28 funny farm he seems to survive right to
79:33 have survived I have friends that know
79:38 him personally
79:38 very close first-degree friends of mine
79:41 who are family members of mine through
79:45 bloodline but through our 20-year
79:47 relationship and he enjoys the work of
79:53 this individual so he comes over and
79:54 visits and I asked them the other day I
79:56 said what do you think of Kanye West man
80:00 like he was just a trumps
80:03 Oval Office and this really wild
80:06 dialogue and I said well the funny thing
80:10 was is he wanted to come over our house
80:11 but for various reasons we couldn't
80:13 couldn't have him over the particularly
80:16 that he wanted to come over and so you
80:17 said well I've got a choice I can come
80:20 to your place or I've got an invitation
80:22 to come see Trump so I guess I'll go see
80:24 Trump since I can't come to your place
80:25 that's how close to home this
80:27 relationship is but they are completely
80:31 out of his demographic there are two old
80:35 white guys above 70 or above and I said
80:41 well what do you think about him you
80:42 know I think that he speaks in such
80:45 symbology that people don't get him but
80:47 he's actually saying some pretty
80:47 brilliant stuff but he sounds crazy to a
80:50 lot of folks that have less command of
80:53 the English language and they said oh
80:56 he's smart he's really smart he doesn't
81:00 mess around he's legit
81:02 I thought wow that's interesting because
81:05 you know you watch Trump and Trump says
81:07 that he was smart and you're kind of
81:09 going well I'd like to know exactly why
81:11 you think that and my friends told me
81:13 and believe my friends are the kind of
81:16 folks that if they didn't like somebody
81:17 they'd let him know really fast they'd
81:20 let me know excuse me they wouldn't let
81:21 them know but they would definitely tell
81:22 me oh yeah he's just kind of a crazy
81:24 nothing like that at all
81:25 completely the opposite how cool would
81:28 it be to have him on this show
81:30 let him speak his mind to people who
81:32 totally get him right but then you have
81:36 individuals let's just digress just a
81:38 tad just in case you guys have had this
81:39 happen to you you will have people that
81:43 were on the wrong side and eventually
81:45 transformed to the correct side now what
81:48 is wrong and right well they were doing
81:51 harm to man initially not realizing what
81:54 they were doing and then they switched
81:55 the Hopsin rapper guy right hecho psi in
81:59 you haven't found this guy go listen to
82:02 him go watch his most recent videos this
82:04 dude is so lucid it is sick man he is
82:07 the rapper of the show I get him to do
82:09 something for me man and I would be the
82:11 bomb and loved to have him on this show
82:13 but he joined the rap industry and he
82:16 was due
82:16 all the stuff that rappers did you know
82:20 [ __ ] her hoes and weed this and weed
82:23 that and he finally woke up and he just
82:25 said you know I'm not doing this anymore
82:27 that particular form of hip-hop which is
82:29 not the classic form of hip-hop from the
82:31 80s is this 90 stuff is not what I want
82:36 to be involved in and so he pulled out
82:38 and he has become more famous than ever
82:42 before I mean one of his videos he's in
82:44 the desert talking about his struggle
82:46 with Christianity and believing in all
82:48 of that and the fact that he's fallen
82:50 out of it because he started thinking
82:51 for himself and it's the most touching
82:53 thing you've ever seen your life like
82:57 he's got 57 million views on that thing
82:59 I don't think Kanye West has too many
83:02 videos that have hit that level and
83:04 nobody knows who Hopson is everybody
83:06 knows who Kanye is right several
83:09 intelligence agents from around the
83:11 world in retirement 20 years out of the
83:15 game they've taken interviews and
83:17 they've said the population believes a
83:24 completely false reality and they've
83:29 elaborated they've said look all the
83:31 history you think is true is fake
83:33 most of the science you believe is fake
83:36 who you think is in charge is fake how
83:40 your country works in terms of political
83:43 parties and who elects you and who does
83:44 that is fake these guys aren't selling
83:48 books they're just trying to warn the
83:51 population because they've reached a
83:54 point in their life where they are
83:55 closer to death at least and they're
83:59 starting to think about that sort of
84:00 conversation and accountability with the
84:02 other side if it happens to exist and
84:04 they turn another leaf and like man I'm
84:07 gonna I'm gonna repent I'm gonna try to
84:10 get people to pull out of this game wake
84:15 up
84:16 most of us are on that path that watch
84:19 this show right
84:20 we need to continue waking up I think
84:26 anything that you believed let's say
84:28 you're in your 30s 30s or more but it
84:32 obviously applies to everyone who can
84:34 hear my voice right everything you've
84:37 ever been indoctrinated into believing
84:39 as a young person mm-hmm you gotta do
84:42 what I said the other episode reevaluate
84:44 all that turn off the input mechanisms
84:49 that aren't your input mechanisms right
84:52 rely on more on face to face
84:53 conversations with people have had
84:55 experiences where they know what
84:57 happened because they were there again
84:59 it's still their bias it's still their
85:01 filters but at least you have a hope of
85:05 figuring out what's going on in the
85:06 world
85:07 now hopefully I've been fairly
85:09 consistent on this show and that the
85:11 things that I tell you that I believe
85:13 are absolute truths about how the world
85:15 works more so I think in the revision
85:19 istic history or in the false science
85:24 the the pop science the crap science out
85:26 there you know those are my opinions I
85:29 do do an extreme amount of research and
85:32 things and you know I have history that
85:34 I don't share on the show much because I
85:37 don't know it's I try not to make this
85:41 show the me show you know obviously I
85:45 have to cite from my own experience to
85:46 give anything I say any level
85:48 credibility but hopefully I've been
85:50 consistent up in the show that you know
85:51 that there's no paycheck coming from
85:54 anywhere besides the was a $20 a month
85:57 from $20 going to some bank account and
86:00 Adsense that gets shifted to me after
86:02 five months that turns into 100 bucks
86:05 but I've done you know I'll just give
86:07 you one little example and you can apply
86:09 it to everything else and assume that
86:11 this level of research is how I treat
86:14 everything in my life if you made it
86:16 into this episode then you deserve this
86:19 information I don't like mysteries about
86:23 how the world works but when I was young
86:26 I had no
86:29 conception that the political system in
86:32 this country was screwed up so I never
86:33 thought that was a big mystery I mean I
86:35 knew there was more that I didn't
86:37 understand about how the hill worked you
86:39 know but science was an area where I ran
86:45 into tons of anomalies constantly the
86:48 black hole as I always talked about in
86:50 other episodes SuperDuper delved into
86:52 that and it was fun it was dynamic there
86:55 was all kinds of different theories
86:56 about their shapes about how they come
86:58 together and that eventually again it
87:00 dissipated gravity I had someone comment
87:03 recently how could you possibly believe
87:06 the gravity's real I was in a
87:10 self-assigned project probably from my
87:13 late teens to my Jesus late 20s I
87:18 mentioned this a couple times but this
87:20 might give you a little bit more
87:23 information that you might find valuable
87:25 right but I wrote papers and like white
87:31 papers on various theories and because
87:33 my belief was that gravity has to
87:35 survive the physical model or it can't
87:38 exist it can't be a phenomenon this the
87:40 old gravity theory that is currently the
87:43 definition which keeps it a phenomenon
87:45 is that mass pulls against mass there's
87:47 somehow information travelling between
87:49 particles it creates this attraction no
87:52 matter how far away in the universe it
87:53 is and as I always tell you guys you
87:57 know when you believe a falsehood your
87:58 body doesn't accept it your mind doesn't
88:00 accept it your gut doesn't accept it and
88:02 my mind body and soul could never accept
88:04 that explanation because it had no
88:07 physical model whatsoever and I could
88:10 listen to the most brilliant minds in
88:11 the world and they always came up just
88:13 dead empty on this how this particular
88:17 theory of gravity works the wounded up
88:20 happening was I over the course of at
88:22 least a decade I researched intensely
88:26 every theory down to the subatomic level
88:30 the quark level using quantum mechanics
88:33 and string theory and everything that
88:35 was out there that I could study and
88:36 nothing explained what I was seeing
88:40 until less than ten years ago I bumped
88:43 into this dude online Eric dullard and
88:46 he again as you've lost you hardcore
88:50 listeners no he just started reading the
88:52 paperwork out of all the legendary folks
88:56 that discovered electricity right they
88:58 discovered its existence and how it
89:00 worked and they started advancing this
89:02 theory of ether and then in one little
89:08 video as watching a Varrick dollar
89:09 presenting at a college you put this
89:11 this diagram up that was again drawn in
89:13 the 1800's of the negative pressure
89:15 between objects created by ether there's
89:19 still a lot of mystery as to where ether
89:21 comes from but that it's it's an is that
89:24 just exists whether or not the universe
89:26 is in a container whether or not this
89:28 stuff is somehow strung together some
89:29 way against string theory doesn't really
89:31 help ether model whatsoever I had a very
89:37 brilliant physicist tell me that
89:38 recently you sounds like you're really
89:40 epping towards the string theory was
89:41 like no not that trust me because this
89:44 this and this he's like oh yeah but once
89:47 I start researching ether and it was the
89:51 as it is above so2 is a below theory
89:54 that there is only an infinitesimal
89:57 amount of laws of mass and energy that
90:05 all behaves in the same exact way that I
90:08 found out that water and ether behave
90:10 exactly the same way and then everything
90:14 came together so those of you who still
90:17 you know push Flat Earth on me
90:19 personally again I love the fact you
90:21 guys are doing your research one day I
90:23 want you to prove it once I saw a bubble
90:26 in water and thought about it first what
90:28 second that the bubble is being held
90:30 together by forces from the outside a
90:33 unified force but then the water is not
90:35 still is that the water is constantly
90:37 moving around the bubble bubble itself
90:39 because it is a bubble of air and the
90:42 pressure is very light on a bubble it
90:46 oscillates in its shape but for the most
90:48 part you know they pretty much hold
90:49 together but now you make that out of
90:51 ball of plasma and you cover it with a
90:53 draw
90:53 crust that's cool and you have earth in
90:58 a bowl of water bucket of water if you
91:01 have two bubbles that get close to each
91:02 other they're going to attract to each
91:03 other because there's gonna be more
91:05 force on the outside edges than between
91:08 them and they're gonna push together
91:10 once I saw this model and took into
91:13 account the the most brilliant people
91:16 that have existed in last 200 years
91:17 Ferriday to Tesla and all the guys in
91:19 between it completely clicked I didn't
91:24 make that clique out of some knee-jerk
91:26 reaction to the theory and me
91:28 desperately wanting to have that solved
91:31 in my life but because I had 10 years of
91:36 active intense research that you know I
91:41 handed it off to a person that I knew
91:43 that knew some of the most famous people
91:46 in the world for physics they're stuck
91:50 in wheelchairs who have now passed you
91:54 know the reply I got back was you know
91:56 this is before I found ether but I was a
91:59 being towards an ether all
92:00 interpretation of gravity at the time
92:02 without even knowing it he said it was
92:05 some of the best research / theory that
92:07 they'd ever seen so that gave me kind of
92:10 a little boost to continue thinking
92:12 about it but then I had to let it go
92:13 about 28 29 years old I had to cook it
92:18 in my brain so I cooked it for another
92:20 20 years
92:21 and finally what I saw that model a
92:24 couple years ago I don't know maybe five
92:25 years ago it was like a huge light bulb
92:29 went off in my brain and what they had
92:31 already figured out was completely
92:32 understandable by me so now gravity for
92:34 me has a complete perfect physical model
92:38 perfect when I come to you with other
92:42 theories it is typically this sort of
92:45 lineage and my person and my personal
92:48 research that gives me my confidence and
92:52 telling you that something is right or
92:54 wrong or true or false right when all
92:57 your friends who are on the left side
92:58 talk to you and all they can basically
93:01 repeat are
93:04 you know bullet points and tag lines
93:09 they got off their favorite media you
93:12 know that you're talking to a person
93:13 doesn't think for themselves and so then
93:16 as Marshall McLuhan said you can see the
93:18 impact of media on human beings so I
93:23 think that's about it hopefully you feel
93:24 me on this again we have we have all
93:28 awakened I think in very distinct unique
93:31 ways I'm sure we can a lot of us can be
93:34 grouped into various wake up groups like
93:37 for for a lot of us that day in
93:40 September 11 2001 that was very
93:43 Awakening to us eventually for others it
93:47 was something completely different
93:49 share in the comments your mechanism if
93:52 you think I haven't covered it
93:53 especially that might help someone else
93:55 you guys are really talking to each
93:57 other in the comments and it's really
93:59 fun to watch because again most people
94:01 are being very courteous to each other
94:02 and they completely don't believe the
94:04 same thing but such healthy dialogue all
94:08 of us are doing one thing that I think
94:11 the entire world has lost track of which
94:13 is thinking we think we discern we use
94:20 our intelligence as well as our smarts
94:22 if you haven't been to deep thoughts
94:24 radio calm that's where a bunch of this
94:26 stuff exists it's an audio form video
94:29 form and there's a lot Facebook group if
94:31 you want to get into some of the
94:32 conversations there the Facebook group
94:34 is I should say I think one of the most
94:38 healthy groups out there I do monitor
94:40 all the posts before they go in so
94:43 you'll post it gets held and I take a
94:44 look at it but I'm telling you the half
94:48 the time I accidentally if I don't post
94:50 it which is like less than a single
94:52 percent it's either I've accidentally
94:55 deleted it or I accept it and the posts
94:58 that you post that has been deleted so
95:00 then I'll get rid of it because it's
95:01 just going to some dead link somewhere
95:03 but very I can't remember maybe when the
95:06 when the group first started we had some
95:09 emotions flying around quite a bit and
95:11 I'll let some pretty pretty acidic
95:14 arctic air arguments go on but if
95:16 someone starts getting abusive
95:18 towards other folks than I I try to step
95:20 in and calm him down and let him you
95:22 know apologize we've had some really
95:24 great listeners who have gone in and had
95:28 big shootouts with people I kind of said
95:30 you know hey it's okay if you have a
95:32 different opinion but please don't call
95:34 people names and that kind of stuff
95:35 because we're trying to keep this civil
95:37 and one of the guys apologized right and
95:40 just immediately sorry guys you know
95:42 because he wanted to stay in the group
95:43 because he realized this was something
95:45 for him so again we have one of the best
95:47 groups out there I know is social media
95:49 I know it's far spoke but we have a
95:53 pretty good thing going on there I have
95:54 a patreon page as well it fluctuates for
95:58 those of you who subscribe to that and
96:00 donate every month you know it's
96:02 fantastic I think we're $21 or something
96:04 like that but again it's for me it's the
96:07 it's a thought that counts
96:09 with all this stuff you know the counsel
96:11 on the videos for me have that effect on
96:14 me
96:15 you know the subscriptions it's just
96:17 really cool that I think we're finding
96:18 each other and again if the world is a
96:21 different place and teleportation was
96:23 easy this would probably be a big forum
96:25 right we'd have a nice big town-hall
96:28 meeting on a separate Channel or
96:29 something right so I go and then maybe
96:31 we do a town hall meeting and I barely
96:33 talk and just get you guys opinions but
96:34 that's what the comment sections are
96:35 about currently right regardless now I
96:39 appreciate you guys thanks for watching
96:41 this show take care of yourself in
96:43 someone else and I'll see in the next
96:44 deep thoughts over now
