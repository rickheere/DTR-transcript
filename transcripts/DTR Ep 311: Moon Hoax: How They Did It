00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemans deep
00:36 thoughts on this air show day in
00:40 Huntington Beach California so you're
00:43 gonna hear a few f-18s go by and perhaps
00:48 you'd an f-16 but they're almost done
00:52 today I thought I would talk about
00:54 something that is I've mentioned
00:56 elements of it but we haven't just gone
00:58 straight for it you've already seen the
01:00 title so you know how they faked the
01:03 moon mission one of the things that hear
01:07 a lot is and it's actually starting to
01:09 boil off it's more of a baby boomer and
01:12 God bless you if you're a baby boomer
01:13 and you watch this show you're not the
01:15 people I'm talking about but your
01:16 average baby boomer that just has a
01:18 limited brain they just in this
01:20 particular area they are such good
01:22 people is what it is as if they just
01:26 have a limited amount of evil that they
01:29 can conceive of and so the problem is is
01:32 all I can't imagine this I can't imagine
01:34 that one of the things they always say
01:36 is well I can't believe the moon hoax is
01:40 a conspiracy because or the moon hoax is
01:45 real because I can't imagine all those
01:47 people conspiring against America and
01:52 then no one said anything right
01:54 that's always the super [ __ ]
01:59 technique of not dealing with the
02:00 information and it doesn't matter it's
02:04 it's so funny because I have relatives
02:05 who say this and they almost laugh
02:07 through it in a condescending way that's
02:09 like oh oh mark there's nothing that you
02:13 can say that will go get past my super
02:17 deep intellectual cowardice never
02:18 research anything know everything
02:20 [ __ ] brain hmm well today is an
02:24 episode to give you some ammunition
02:28 against that ridiculous cowardice way of
02:31 allowing evil to perpetuate over and
02:35 over and over right let's not forget I
02:38 say it all the time NASA pulls down this
02:42 was a figure from 2014 when I had the
02:44 other show I'm killed to radio
02:46 60 million dollars a day
02:48 in absolute fraudulent science just
02:52 selling us pictures while they take the
02:53 money and do whatever the hell they're
02:54 doing with it who knows but here's that
02:57 here's the rub and this is where we get
02:59 back to the accusation of well I just
03:01 can't imagine that many people
03:03 conspiring against the world now I'm
03:07 gonna be a little facetious here because
03:09 I don't know the exact digits but I
03:12 would wager that you could probably take
03:14 out of everyone who worked on the Apollo
03:15 missions from the second the JFK
03:17 announced it to the second we pulled off
03:21 of supposedly the last Apollo mission
03:24 you could interview 98 to 99% of
03:28 everyone involved in all the
03:29 construction and all the testing with a
03:32 polygraph one that's absolutely perfect
03:35 again given to us by god this one's
03:37 absolutely 100% and you asked these
03:40 people did you participate in man
03:42 stepping on the moon where you know
03:44 where this was real and they're gonna
03:47 say yes and they're gonna pass the
03:50 polygraph test but it doesn't mean that
03:54 it actually took place now some of
03:57 you're gonna go yeah yeah of course
03:59 and something gonna go what what do you
04:01 mean they passed the polygraph test but
04:03 we wasn't real how does that work
04:05 because in their brains they were so
04:08 utterly compartmentalized they believe
04:11 that whatever they did actually ended up
04:14 on the moon there's a guy in Costa Mesa
04:16 his father supposedly well his father
04:18 did excuse me work on special kind of
04:22 bolts that work that were used on the
04:25 Apollo capsule and the module and all
04:28 this other stuff and in his heart of
04:30 hearts his father's a hero because his
04:32 father participated in the Apollo
04:33 missions he thinks his dad stuff went to
04:36 the moon
04:37 now I'm not the kind of [ __ ] to tell
04:40 him otherwise but I've had to hear this
04:42 and I've seen his chest puffed up now
04:44 that guy as far as I understand the son
04:47 didn't do anything much with his life he
04:49 just inherited all of his dad's stuff
04:51 and so he's kind of like I don't need to
04:53 ever become anything because my dad's
04:55 something my dad was something I got
04:57 these genes you know it's like okay if
04:59 you don't take care of him brother
05:00 as if he never existed but if you think
05:04 about the command center at Houston
05:07 these people are staring at monitors
05:11 reading numbers coming in from some feed
05:14 somewhere in the universe and they
05:17 believe that they are seeing a mission
05:20 taking place not realizing that earlier
05:23 that the year of 69 that a demo
05:26 satellite I mean a satellite was pushed
05:28 into low orbit and was beaming down
05:31 telemetry for the entire mission from
05:34 start to finish as a simulation of the
05:37 mission the physical difference between
05:40 the simulation of the mission and the
05:43 one that actually was televised on
05:44 television in terms of the numbers they
05:47 saw was just the numbers adjusted a
05:50 little bit so someone's staring at a
05:53 monitor with a lie-detector test will
05:55 say well yeah I was told that what I was
05:58 staring at was real data of course I
06:00 thought I think we went to the moon Bing
06:02 the light turns green next person but I
06:06 know what some of you think some of you
06:07 think well there was a three stations
06:13 three satellite or three antenna
06:14 receiver stations strategically placed
06:17 around the world such that no matter
06:19 where the world turned we're always able
06:22 to talk to the astronauts on the moon
06:23 here their communications then relay it
06:26 with ground technology they interviewed
06:30 these old guys we're gonna get we're
06:32 gonna get into the start-to-finish thing
06:34 here but they interview these old guys
06:36 that believe in Australia British
06:38 documentary person I believe it was
06:41 Australia but nevertheless I saw it and
06:44 they're really old guys now and he let
06:47 them tell their story about how every
06:49 time they you know went over and there
06:51 they were pointed at the moon they they
06:53 got the data and when they were low
06:54 orbit they got all the orbital data and
06:58 the guy finally just asked him he said
06:59 well couldn't it have been that this was
07:04 broadcast from that demo satellite that
07:06 was up there and they all looked at each
07:08 other really funny as if it was for the
07:10 very first time they had never
07:12 contemplated that that was a possibility
07:15 and one of them had the courage if not
07:17 to to go oh my god he's probably he's
07:21 right we could have been had now the
07:25 other thing that is really silly that
07:26 people forget is that you can broadcast
07:30 from the ground or from a plane directly
07:33 at a receiver and it will feel like it's
07:35 from space you just adjust the frequency
07:37 the amp I'm sorry that with the wattage
07:40 and you will feel like you're getting it
07:42 you know exactly from where it's
07:43 supposed to be it's supposed to be from
07:46 the moon your broadcaster really weak at
07:48 the antenna but you could be literally
07:49 on the same antenna you could just have
07:52 a little receiver there's been all kinds
07:55 of signal interruptions in this world
07:57 for pranks right but let's rewind
08:03 obviously what I'm going to tell you is
08:05 partially what I have deduced from Bart
08:09 sibrel's series partially from a
08:12 tremendous number of YouTube videos
08:15 created by special effects and gurus my
08:22 own friends who are special flex gurus
08:24 taking the photography and put it
08:26 through software to say whoa there's
08:28 five light sources in this image it's
08:32 also going to rely on the two people
08:33 that debriefed me in 1991 who were both
08:36 on the Mars mission and then my own
08:39 hunches now YouTube is just strictly by
08:43 itself with the videos made by gurus
08:46 there's a bit of a rub here because
08:48 usually we're able to say this is the
08:50 source of this and the source of that in
08:52 2005 the amount of videos that are being
08:55 put online that had been made in the 90s
08:57 and the 80s picking apart the moon
08:59 missions were unbelievable and they were
09:02 so incredibly revealing that one video
09:07 which I can't find anymore which dealt
09:09 with front projection I simply can't
09:12 find it anymore
09:13 there's a video Buzz Aldrin saying in a
09:17 late night interview with some news
09:20 station and once we find out how to get
09:22 to the moon it'll be a lot easier to get
09:24 to Mars the jaren ism guys got that
09:28 clear
09:28 inside one of his videos but the dude
09:30 won't respond to anything on YouTube so
09:32 I don't know how to get ahold of the guy
09:33 you guys want to go out and pound him
09:35 for that clip he may know exactly what
09:38 clip he has in it once we get that clip
09:40 we're gonna rap we're gonna scrape it
09:43 out of his video and put it all over the
09:44 planet so you guys can see it because
09:46 it's one of my opening lines in my
09:47 episode 26 and people are like what the
09:49 hell you talking about
09:50 some of you've seen it very few of you
09:53 seen it some of you haven't seen it but
09:55 it's real I mean there's some things in
09:57 this world you just can't make up you
09:59 know and that would be one that would be
10:01 pointless to make up right now the moon
10:04 hoax requires a tremendous amount of
10:08 perspective
10:10 the overall goal which again we're not
10:14 sure exactly if this was meant to be or
10:18 this was just a general by-product but
10:19 what we got out of the moon missions was
10:21 the ICBM the intercontinental ballistic
10:23 missile the second we were done with the
10:27 missions in 73 we saw the Trident
10:31 submarine you know with that missile
10:33 pops out of the water blows off its
10:35 shield and hauls ass across the ocean so
10:39 we have you know it had been military
10:41 militarized incredibly and if you look
10:44 at all of the scientists coming out of
10:45 Germany it could be you know Wernher von
10:47 Braun made the v1 a v2 rocket it was all
10:50 weaponized stuff now the I was gonna do
10:54 a little little digression here there's
10:56 some of you that are rediscovering the
10:58 history of World War two we'll just
11:00 leave it like that who are the bad guys
11:03 who were the good guys
11:03 and when traditional phrases come out
11:06 that really make a particular group look
11:10 evil and bad and another group look good
11:13 there is a distinct possibility that we
11:15 have all those backwards and so whether
11:18 or not these Nazis were horrible or not
11:20 in various arenas based on who was
11:23 pushing whose buttons and who was trying
11:25 to be peaceful and who was trying to be
11:26 at war I know some of you are aware that
11:29 those debates that are going on now I
11:32 don't know if anyone's been completely
11:35 conclusive because again as the Internet
11:37 continues to exist a bunch of new stuff
11:39 gets revealed that it's like 4050 years
11:41 old
11:42 but anyway NASA is built out of the
11:45 racketeering masterminds out of Germany
11:48 led by Verna von Braun now this guy
11:51 almost undoubtedly wanted to travel into
11:54 space why not what's what's the point of
11:57 a rocket if he can't travel to space now
11:58 whether or not you can actually
12:00 accomplish it as a completely different
12:01 thing I learned from sibrel that that
12:05 runner Braun Braun's major plan was to
12:08 build a space station and ferry fuel up
12:11 to a space station in low orbit around
12:13 Earth and build a vehicle that could
12:14 then continue the journey to wherever
12:16 you wanted it to go as I've heard it
12:20 percentage to me run over Braun's
12:22 original target was Mars and the
12:26 supposedly in the white house said let's
12:28 try the moon dude seems sort of
12:31 mind-blowing to me that a person of
12:33 Verner von Braun's excellence would pick
12:36 a ridiculously far away target as his
12:38 first thing but I also think that in his
12:40 brain he was going to build a rocket
12:41 that had so much fuel on it that he's
12:43 going to almost manually drive it there
12:45 and I don't know again how you account
12:47 for a lot of the variance in velocity of
12:50 our planet's orbital speed
12:52 Mars's orbital speed and how you're
12:54 gonna catch up you know jump into a car
12:55 with the door open at 100 miles an hour
12:58 I just don't know how that's possible
12:59 that's for a different episode so the
13:03 other thing to remember and again we've
13:04 done this in the second episode did we
13:07 got you know Khrushchev is like really
13:09 rubbing it in hardcore Sputnik first
13:13 astronaut in space you know again these
13:14 things could be faked these could be
13:16 claymation things there's a lot of
13:17 evidence to that but they are definitely
13:19 throwing beeping objects into orbit
13:22 around the Earth even if it only goes
13:24 one orbit and falls back they were able
13:26 to do it I know some of you really upset
13:29 about the theory of space existing and
13:31 what-have-you let's just say that orbit
13:33 it may not be what is traditionally
13:36 thought to be if you have a problem with
13:37 this okay please don't fill up the
13:39 comments with a bunch of alternate
13:42 universe theories this conversations for
13:45 those who believe that the moon hoax is
13:47 at least capable of low orbit now it's
13:50 hard for a lot of young people to
13:52 understand is that there were no rockets
13:55 okay the v1 a v2 rocket out of Germany
13:59 that was just hurled into England well
14:01 you don't for those of you too young to
14:02 remember or they didn't get the history
14:05 you know Verna von Braun designed these
14:07 big fat rockets that were sort of black
14:09 and white checkers the Masonic thing and
14:11 he would shoot him into southern England
14:14 indiscriminately meaning he didn't care
14:16 whether or not they hit Friend or Foe
14:18 excuse me a military target or a
14:20 personal target so most of them just
14:21 landed in neighborhoods they were so
14:24 massive with a conventional warhead
14:25 meaning just explosives not nuclear
14:27 weapon heads because that didn't exist
14:29 for them they blow a house completely to
14:31 smithereens kill the family all kinds of
14:34 shrapnel flying everywhere and it was
14:35 just a rain tear on them and again
14:38 Churchill wouldn't leave them alone so
14:40 that might be the reason why that ended
14:42 up happening then that there was a
14:43 refinement to it with a little bit more
14:45 guidance a little bit more arranged and
14:47 they were trying to hit London with
14:48 these things right so the v2 goes deeper
14:51 into the UK using timed gyroscopes to
14:56 tip the tip the thing over so when it
15:00 came to putting something in orbit
15:02 that's a whole nother bag man that that
15:05 is way beyond just turning something
15:07 over the pond over the little river and
15:10 smashing into a house I would wager it's
15:13 ten to a hundred times more difficult to
15:15 put something into orbit and the theory
15:17 of orbit just for those of you don't
15:18 know is that you throw an object so far
15:22 that when it tries to come down the
15:25 earth is missing because it's over the
15:27 edge of the earth and so it falls around
15:29 the earth and the push from a throw wins
15:31 this is that this shows theory it pushes
15:35 it back to earth but it's already has so
15:37 much forward momentum that it keeps
15:38 falling around the earth it just keeps
15:40 falling and falling and falling and
15:41 eventually the orbit does deteriorate
15:43 and if you don't have some rocketry to
15:45 move it back out then it will slam into
15:48 the earth and eventually be over so we
15:51 needed to build a rocket to get into
15:54 orbit to get into low orbit low orbit is
15:58 about I don't exactly know what the
16:00 cutoff is but I would say 200 miles up
16:03 now 5,280 feet is a one it's a single
16:08 mile so multiply that
16:09 times 200 and you'll start getting how
16:11 far up we are massive like we have to
16:14 engage the Russians head-on now the
16:19 thing was that the Russians weren't
16:21 saying we're making weapons we're not
16:24 we're you know we're making missiles
16:26 that can get to you with nuclear
16:28 warheads or whatever we want to put in
16:30 these things he wasn't saying that it
16:32 was just this peaceful beautiful thing
16:34 hey we're just putting people in space
16:35 but of course military people are going
16:38 holy [ __ ] you realize if he can get
16:39 things into space then he can get to us
16:42 at a moment's notice and he can blow us
16:44 to pieces and of course there was the
16:47 nuclear scare had been you know wreaking
16:50 havoc the duck-and-cover movement of the
16:52 50s was already insanely intense and
16:55 creating there's a few of you have
16:56 commented about I have some close
16:58 friends of mine in their 70s and they
17:00 said it was horrifying to to see bomb
17:05 tests like one of my friends lived in
17:06 Salt Lake City and he said that that
17:08 when he was a kid he had run to the
17:10 window and they were televising the
17:12 explosion at night the test he could see
17:14 the plumes over the mountain escapes you
17:17 know the bright lights and stuff and he
17:19 would run his bedroom and hi because he
17:20 because the second half of a bomb is the
17:23 big concussion cloud right that's coming
17:26 at you so imagine you know if you see a
17:30 car accident typically in a middle of an
17:32 intersection it's like well it's over
17:33 there
17:34 but imagine the car accident happens and
17:36 now this big shockwave comes at you and
17:39 it could kill you so as soon as you see
17:40 a car accident about to occur you're
17:42 ducking and covering because this thing
17:43 is gonna come at you it's a whole
17:45 different science for the brain that we
17:47 really don't have to deal with today
17:48 because I think most of us realize
17:49 there's never going to be a Nick Euler
17:52 war if a nuclear bomb ever goes off in
17:54 the world it's going to be a deep state
17:55 false flag to hurt us all under one
18:00 world government stuff right let's just
18:04 hope that it's never something that our
18:06 military does so the one scientific
18:10 addition to rocketry
18:12 that a orbital rocket has to accomplish
18:15 is unlike the v1 a v2 which just gets
18:19 hurled into sort of closed space and
18:22 and slams against um some soil in
18:24 England this thing's got to keep going
18:27 and keep going and it's got to go so
18:28 fast
18:29 that it's going to escape the Earth's
18:30 gravitational pull the mare thing goes
18:33 11 miles per second crazy crazy crazy
18:37 fast so now we have to do multistage
18:40 rockets the complexity of that is
18:43 enormous not only do you have to have a
18:46 propellant that's willing to go without
18:47 pure oxygen being available the v1 a v2
18:50 rocket has a solid-state engine as I
18:52 understand it so it was a propulsion
18:54 system that was almost like your little
18:57 rockets that you can do as a kid the a B
19:01 C D engines they're hard right and you
19:04 light them with the fuse and they burn
19:05 I'm not sure if the V v1 or v2 either
19:08 one of those got two fuel Rockets but
19:10 when you run out of air your propulsion
19:13 system is going to have to have oxygen
19:16 mixed inside of the fuel system and so
19:19 they had to come up with a new
19:19 propellant now they have to have a
19:22 multi-stage rocket and if you think
19:24 about it imagine you had two of the the
19:27 little cardboard tubes that are inside
19:29 your toilet paper well one of them let's
19:33 see it and you had the cardboard one
19:34 that's twice as tall or three times as
19:36 tall so you take the cardboard why don't
19:38 you kind of try to bend it with your
19:40 hand maybe a Pringles can or something
19:41 it's like hey that's pretty easy right
19:43 it'd make a long tube it's really simple
19:45 but the second that you have to stack
19:48 these things up well with a really large
19:51 boost to get out of the thicker part of
19:53 the atmosphere and then want to get to
19:55 the second thinner part of the
19:57 atmosphere and then you have to connect
19:59 them together and they have to hang on
20:01 to each other under the most enormous
20:02 pressures you could possibly imagine
20:04 right you're gonna take this thing stack
20:06 it up on each other and then move at 11
20:08 miles per second unbelievable stress on
20:12 metal so the integrity of how to build
20:14 this thing was really daunting in the
20:17 60s it had really never been done before
20:20 okay so they have to in order to begin
20:26 anything that's going to hoax the minds
20:28 of anyone and again I personally want to
20:32 believe that they attempted to do this
20:34 for real and just
20:36 we found out that they weren't able to
20:37 do it and so they did the next best
20:38 thing which was to hoax it outright so
20:42 to get this thing to take off is one of
20:44 the most phenomenal accomplishments of
20:46 mankind to begin with just low-orbit is
20:48 phenomenal and so now it's pretty
20:52 turnkey right
20:53 the SpaceX company was able just to
20:55 start standing on the shoulders of
20:58 giants and it's like oh wow the Falcon
21:00 series just launches and it's just
21:01 totally easy now the course they have
21:04 this claim that these boosters come back
21:05 and land and we know that a tremendous
21:08 amount of computer-generated imagery has
21:11 been used to fake a giant swath of space
21:16 X's technical claims and you talk about
21:18 F was an FEC or SEC violations don't
21:24 worry about him you know
21:25 tweeting about you know being a private
21:27 company to lie to your shareholders with
21:30 computer-generated imagery is probably a
21:34 brand-new game that makes other
21:37 companies jealous rage so the first
21:41 first goal is to get a rocket to do
21:45 anything at all now in terms of what the
21:49 milestones were in the 60s you know the
21:51 the number one thing that they needed to
21:54 do although they could probably have
21:55 figured out a way to to fake it it's to
21:59 get something just get this triangular
22:01 you know conical capsule into low orbit
22:06 that's all they need to do to complete
22:08 the entire moon hoax and some of you
22:12 might be saying well what do you mean
22:13 there's a whole moon surface thing and
22:15 the re-entry and the landing on the moon
22:17 and coming back up to the those things
22:20 could be simulated in a studio which is
22:22 the video that I can't find anymore was
22:25 all regarding front projection the guy
22:27 actually showed some of the footage that
22:30 was sold to the public as real footage
22:33 of the moon landing and then he ran a
22:36 projector against a shape a front
22:38 projection shape in his studio I said
22:42 there's the same exact shot amazing
22:44 right and you're just you'd think about
22:46 this and it just it was thinking about
22:48 the footage in a completely
22:49 opposite way for instance let me go back
22:52 to the toilet pool toilet paper roll
22:54 let's say you had a really high res 4k
22:57 camera and you put it inside the opening
23:01 of a toilet paper roll so we're gonna
23:03 have that James Bond looking at the
23:05 barrel thing right the old shot where
23:07 they the gun goes back and forth and
23:09 then bond shoots and then the blood
23:11 comes down the gun barrel signifying
23:13 that he got the guy that was pointing
23:15 the gun at him right well your brain is
23:18 thinking the black outer area is the
23:22 part of the tube that is that the
23:24 cameras inside of that is blocking the
23:26 shot from being outside and you see the
23:29 shot kind of move around right well
23:31 front projection allows you to make a
23:33 circular canvas you project against the
23:37 in a black room any light that is not
23:40 hitting the canvas is completely lost in
23:42 this dark room and then all you have to
23:44 do is take your source video wherever
23:46 you have it and just shake it in the
23:48 room and when you see it on the circle
23:51 it looks like you're looking out of a
23:53 tube but you're not
23:55 they just reversed it in your brain the
23:57 big shot of the lunar module top part
24:01 we're supposed to have the two
24:02 astronauts in it they came back up to
24:05 the orbital Apollo module as it docks
24:10 back with the system this is the shot
24:11 that he actually showed us in this video
24:13 it's old guy and he was he was pretty
24:16 much nonchalant like yeah man I helped
24:17 develop this interesting now the other
24:21 part of the of the at home above-ground
24:25 testing was the spacesuit was the
24:30 capsule was all the stress testing of
24:35 all these objects how showing them
24:36 falling in the water
24:37 the astronauts actually roaming around
24:39 inside the water which was simulating
24:42 sort of a you know zero-g or a light
24:44 one-sixth gravity and also water is an
24:49 amazing test medium to figure out
24:53 whether or not as something is air proof
24:55 you ever talk to a plumber they will
24:58 tell you that water can go where air
24:59 can't
25:00 and when I learned that as a kid either
25:02 they rode that's pretty wild
25:04 and so you could actually have a leak in
25:08 a suit and as soon as it's got extra
25:11 moisture inside they know they got a
25:12 problem and so they continue working on
25:14 it now the other thing was that NASA was
25:17 a brand-new organization and so the
25:19 problem is they had limited staff
25:20 there's a brand new organization and so
25:23 they had to reach out to all kinds of
25:25 different agencies around the planet to
25:28 get compartmentalised to get certain
25:30 parts made you make the suit you make
25:32 the capsule you make the engines you
25:34 make the fuselage or whatever you call
25:36 the the main cabinet or the main
25:38 cylinder area right someone's got to
25:42 build a big crawler that big giant
25:44 crawler that took the Saturn five and
25:46 drove one mile an hour up to the launch
25:49 pad someone's gonna build the launch pad
25:50 you know the stuff this stuff gets
25:53 enormous and it created a tremendous
25:54 amount of jobs and because everything
25:58 was so difficult at every step of the
26:01 way we gained a tremendous amount of
26:03 knowledge about all these different
26:04 areas so there's a lot of benefit to
26:07 this program going on the catch is that
26:10 getting to the moon is a major major
26:15 unbelievably dangerous situation and our
26:18 knowledge of space and the Van Allen
26:21 belts the natural magnetic barrier that
26:23 goes around the earth was virtually
26:28 unknown or at least untested right we
26:30 had theories that these things existed
26:31 we know that the compass moves itself
26:33 north every single time we pull it out
26:36 and so we're thinking something is
26:38 causing this to happen on the surface of
26:40 the earth and so when the space shuttle
26:44 went up in 1998 I think hit 450 475
26:48 the astronauts got SuperDuper sick as it
26:53 was as it was I think written in the
26:55 1998 CNN article it basically said the
26:59 Van Allen belts are more lethal than
27:01 NASA previously thought the astronauts
27:05 were seeing shooting stars with their
27:06 eyes closed because the electrons are
27:08 going through and putting pressure on
27:10 their cones and their rods in their
27:11 eyeball people got nauseous
27:14 because it's really just it's minor
27:15 radiation exposure and they had to drop
27:18 the Space Shuttle 100-plus miles down to
27:22 normal orbiting 350 ish and then they
27:25 came home because everybody was done
27:27 well and I didn't hear anyone you know
27:30 dropping dead as a result of that
27:31 mission so hopefully everyone's fine but
27:35 that shows you just how lethal it is up
27:37 there
27:37 and the Van Allen belts are said to not
27:40 exist until about a thousand miles up
27:43 now if we have geocentric satellites
27:45 then we've got satellites deep past the
27:49 Van Allen belts and so as we launch
27:50 these satellites if they truly exist up
27:52 there then they are punching through
27:55 that and they can take measurements
27:57 what's strange is for some reason the
28:00 Orion project was greenlit two years ago
28:02 then hastily cancelled after one mission
28:06 or at least put in a black op scenario
28:10 because the data was coming in and it
28:13 was refuting the ability to put a human
28:15 being through the Van Allen belts so you
28:17 have a very small group of people sit in
28:19 a room and say this alright how are we
28:22 gonna pull this off
28:23 now I want to stress that the brilliance
28:26 of these individuals who will probably
28:28 never be known is hi it is clever times
28:33 clever ^ clever what they were actually
28:37 able to pull off so there is an amazing
28:39 accomplishment by people who are
28:42 probably just trying to say the
28:43 reputation of United States of America
28:45 and potentially obviously pioneers some
28:48 technology along the way so you have a
28:52 breaking point at some point where they
28:54 realize that they can't pull this off
28:57 and I would imagine that this would have
29:00 been fairly early in the process Kennedy
29:02 announces this thing and then we go for
29:04 it within a couple years I think they
29:07 really did the math and said are you
29:09 crazy you have any idea how far away the
29:12 moon is you have any idea how volatile
29:14 space is how volatile the moon surface
29:16 is fact we don't even really know what
29:18 the moon surface is made out of is it
29:21 soft is it hard
29:22 if we put a 10,000 pound thrust rocket
29:25 down you know use it to
29:27 safely is it gonna blow a huge crater in
29:30 the ground or is it gonna be fine we
29:33 don't know so the contingency plan
29:36 starts at some phantom point in time as
29:38 I suggested in my episode 20:56
29:41 I think the green lighting of that will
29:45 basically the approach of arthur c
29:47 clarke a nasa scientist and writer he
29:51 was getting into writing he approached a
29:53 stanley kubrick for a television show
29:55 Stanley said I don't do television shows
29:57 I do movies and he says okay well I will
30:00 start working on a movie version of this
30:02 idea that I have for a television series
30:04 and they wouldn't got I think about
30:09 fifteen million dollars to make the
30:11 movie 2001 a Space Odyssey which at the
30:14 time there was only a couple movies in
30:16 history that actually had a higher
30:17 budget than that so someone was like
30:19 don't worry we'll get you the money
30:21 but there's a very specific distinction
30:24 for 2001 a Space Odyssey the goal is to
30:28 create the most realistic space movie
30:30 ever and I mean ever I'm not sure since
30:35 1968 when it debuted have we ever really
30:40 tried to create a completely realistic
30:42 space movie because you can't you can't
30:45 throw gravity because I mean there's
30:47 there's just kitschy little things with
30:49 stuff a little bunch of you know a bunch
30:51 of bent science sound in space all this
30:53 other stuff but the props that were
30:57 created to finish this film we're very
31:01 helpful for the eventual props that are
31:04 created for the soundstage that ends up
31:07 being where all the moon footage takes
31:09 place there's just one catch one real
31:14 intense catch for this moon hoax thing
31:19 because a bunch of agents working for
31:22 these alphabet agencies they're totally
31:26 into it man they're like man you would
31:27 get to fake the moon mission that is
31:29 awesome that's going to be a lot of fun
31:30 there's at least one director who I
31:33 believe is confessed to having done it
31:35 Stanley Kubrick for at least mission
31:40 eleven and thirteen but the problem is
31:45 you're gonna have to come up with some
31:46 astronauts a group of three to go along
31:52 with the hoax which means you're gonna
31:55 have to find unbelievably talented
31:56 pre-existing astronauts based off of the
31:59 Air Force top guns and you're gonna have
32:03 to get them to lie to go against the
32:06 oath of their entire objective of being
32:09 in the military and then hang on to the
32:12 lie for the rest of their lives
32:15 unfortunately for Gus Grissom and his
32:18 two compadres and unfortunately for NASA
32:21 he was the number one candidate to go
32:24 first but Gus Grissom and I don't know
32:28 about the opinions of his comrades but
32:30 Gus wasn't a liar he wasn't gonna do it
32:33 he called the project a lemon he said we
32:36 are never going to the moon with this
32:38 technology I don't know if he said it in
32:41 any method of anger or if he just
32:43 incidentally said well they're telling
32:45 you this is going to happen but this
32:47 isn't going to happen on this technology
32:49 according to my interview with bart
32:51 sibrel who has spoken with the family
32:53 both the mother and the son who was a
32:55 pilot today he was murdered the three of
33:00 them were murdered probably by cyanide
33:02 capsules or cyanide being injected into
33:05 their environmental suits when they're
33:07 sitting on the Apollo one and a I
33:09 believe it was just the test the day
33:11 before and then they set the cabin on
33:16 fire because they want to blame the pure
33:18 oxygen environment
33:19 these men were bolted into five-point
33:22 seatbelts and none of them attempted to
33:25 undo their seat belts and pull the the
33:28 dynamite emergency door to hopefully get
33:32 the fire out the door they just sat
33:34 there the pictures of them are on the
33:36 internet where they just sat there they
33:38 didn't move their hands didn't move
33:40 there was no chaotic pictures of you
33:43 know like you and I if if any of us were
33:45 set on fire you do or if your prior does
33:47 and you run down the street you know you
33:49 try to put yourself out probably run
33:51 down this
33:52 but you wouldn't be in this rested
33:54 position burned to death so they had to
33:58 kill Gus Grissom and his two partners
34:01 because he wouldn't go along with it
34:04 maybe his partners were the same I don't
34:06 know and that's probably a little bit of
34:10 a setback because they then have to go
34:11 to the other astronauts because they
34:13 can't be killing them all and they have
34:16 to find folks that are probably 33
34:19 degree Masons who feel some upper
34:21 rationale they probably had to change
34:23 their story to the astronauts in say
34:25 okay okay here's the deal
34:26 Russia there are super pain in our ass
34:29 what we're really trying to do is
34:30 bankrupt them develop ICBMs so that once
34:33 we bankrupt them we can hold them
34:35 captive with a threat of nuclear rain
34:39 are you willing to protect your country
34:41 I know it's a weird thing that we have
34:42 to do but we can't go out to the
34:44 American people and say we're gonna
34:45 spend 10 billion dollars in 1960 money
34:48 1970 money to build a bunch of weapons
34:51 that everyone's terrified of because
34:54 people were again they terrified
34:55 everyone with nuclear weapons and then
34:57 they can't say we're gonna put them in
34:59 the sky and be able to send them
35:01 wherever we want to send them at least
35:04 that was probably their opinion right so
35:06 what's the plan how do we fake this
35:07 thing well we have to put three guys
35:10 into low orbit because we need to fake
35:13 images of the Earth from space we need
35:16 to have weightlessness and we're gonna
35:20 have a big splash down when it's over
35:21 now while you're in low orbit faking
35:23 that you're going further and further
35:25 away from the earth using this circular
35:27 window inside your cabin we're going to
35:29 have a bunch of agents in a soundstage
35:31 who have been rehearsing for probably
35:33 months if not years this whole scenario
35:36 when you look at the script from NASA to
35:40 the astronauts as to how this whole
35:41 thing is going to be going down you have
35:45 a two-column script which I've never
35:47 seen before
35:48 one is for the astronauts and one is for
35:50 their ground control they say this you
35:52 say that we're doing this and you do
35:54 this and so it looked like the whole
35:57 thing was scripted out like a Hollywood
35:59 script we know that NASA tapped
36:02 Hollywood to light the Saturn 5 so it
36:05 looked
36:05 absolutely sexy in the dark when they
36:07 launch this thing into space okay so the
36:10 soundstage let's talk about that for a
36:12 split second they have to fake the
36:15 surface of the moon how would you do
36:17 that well we do have pretty powerful
36:19 telescopes we can look at the moon
36:20 surface and kind of get a general idea
36:22 of you know it would be like to be on
36:24 the ground they have super high-res
36:27 photographs that they can use to
36:30 construct pictures and models of the
36:35 moon surface now NASA built at least two
36:39 gigantic mock moons within a warehouse
36:43 you can go see pictures of these and
36:44 they show them to you and they say this
36:45 is just what we use to simulate a test
36:47 of going to the moon the joke is is that
36:51 it's hidden in plain sight it's right in
36:52 your face the very prop they use to fake
36:54 the footage of the lunar module going
36:57 down to the surface as the surface went
36:59 like this was a big model that didn't
37:04 have a bottom or a top and it had a
37:06 camera on her on a train track and I'll
37:09 put these photos in the video for those
37:11 of you coming through podcast but they
37:13 simply bring the camera closer and
37:16 closer to the surface using robot
37:18 controlled arms to keep it very steady
37:20 this is where all this technology came
37:22 from that made Star Wars possible in
37:25 fact one of the great Oscar
37:27 award-winning guys Richard Edlund worked
37:30 on spy cameras before he became a part
37:34 of the Star Wars franchise way back in
37:37 the 70s and 73-74 one of the other
37:40 models is a true top-to-bottom slightly
37:42 smaller but very large I think it's
37:44 probably 15 to 20 feet in diameter
37:47 surface of the moon and there are
37:50 pictures of these guys sculpting the
37:52 surface with I don't know some clay some
37:55 putty whatever it is recreating what
37:57 would they see and photographs on these
38:00 models so when you think you're seeing
38:02 footage of the moon surface you're
38:03 merely looking at a camera filming a
38:05 model as they say in a quest for the
38:09 Holy Grail it's only a model but the
38:12 soundstage soundstage has a lot of
38:16 versatility but it has a lot of
38:17 drawbacks as well
38:18 first drawback is well the moon's got
38:21 one-sixth gravity so how the hell are we
38:23 gonna fake these astronauts not being on
38:26 one one gravity I'm not sure who came up
38:30 with the idea but again this is utterly
38:32 brilliant they over cranked a camera to
38:35 X and all that means is one you have to
38:38 have a pretty good storage facility for
38:40 for film because you're gonna be blowing
38:42 through this thing rolling through the
38:44 stuff at twice the speed but if you were
38:46 to say 24 frames per second is the
38:48 average movie in 1968 when 2001 a Space
38:52 Odyssey was greenlit or sorry came out
38:54 in the theaters sorry and then you shoot
38:57 it at 48 frames per second so twice the
39:00 amount of frames are going through the
39:01 camera but then when you play it back
39:03 you played at 24 everything is slow but
39:07 the resolution is good it doesn't look
39:08 like one of those nineteen oh you know
39:11 five videos everyone's moving really
39:12 fast bursting in their velocities no
39:15 it's it's perfect the resolution is
39:17 there and it's great camera work right
39:20 well the other problem you have with the
39:22 soundstage is that there is no way in
39:25 1969 that they could fake the star
39:29 pattern in the sky they can't address
39:32 the Milky Way which would be utterly
39:34 immutable meaning you couldn't you
39:37 couldn't blotch it out even if they gave
39:39 you that excuse about the iris of the
39:40 camera the aperture of the camera being
39:42 so tight that it can't let in the light
39:44 to let starlight in now there's some
39:46 situations where that would be the case
39:48 but the Milky Way was there completely
39:52 unscathed by an atmosphere right the
39:55 moon doesn't have an atmosphere
39:56 according to NASA now maybe it doesn't
39:58 maybe it doesn't who knows but you know
40:00 when you go outside in a big city and
40:02 you look up all the lights that are in
40:04 the city are reflecting off of the
40:06 atmosphere reflecting off the fog the
40:08 clouds and so you have this big glow
40:10 it's why when you drive towards Vegas in
40:12 the desert you can see it an hour before
40:14 you get there well there's none of that
40:17 in space zero so the Milky Way that you
40:21 see and Lake Havasu in the middle of the
40:24 night which is utterly gorgeous is
40:26 probably two to three times the lumens
40:29 that you would see on earth when you're
40:31 on the moon
40:32 but they can't do it and why can't they
40:34 do it well the inside of a studio is a
40:36 square box a rectangular box and so you
40:39 can't have distortion of a bunch of star
40:43 maps you know someone putting a bunch of
40:44 LEDs or lights or poking holes in a in a
40:47 surface and then have it turn a corner
40:50 and then have the ceiling attached to it
40:52 big problem as well
40:56 you can't run a rigging situation where
40:59 all of the astronauts and I've tested
41:01 this with my own eyes
41:02 taking high-res footage from NASA of the
41:05 astronauts jumping across the moon's
41:06 surface and I was able to establish that
41:09 directly and perpendicular to the ground
41:12 there is a wire that's disturbing the
41:14 pixels in a perfect vertical line in
41:16 fact one point I found a frame I'll try
41:19 to put it in the video where when I high
41:22 conned it when I turned up all the
41:23 contrasts you can distinctly see a
41:26 perpendicular line directly to the
41:28 astronaut now all the astronaut suits
41:31 have a six-inch antenna I believe on
41:33 their left shoulder so people say no
41:35 you're seeing the antenna the problem is
41:37 the antenna is parallel with the back of
41:39 the astronaut so if they're leaning
41:40 forward at all it's not gonna be a
41:42 perfect straight up line they'd have to
41:43 stand uh turley straight up and very few
41:46 shots of the astronauts have that so how
41:50 do you solve for that problem you simply
41:52 tell the people of the world that they
41:54 can't see stars in the cameras because
41:57 they are adjusted for the super bright
41:59 surface yeah again I think there's a lot
42:02 of truth to that up to the point of
42:04 seeing the Milky Way but some of you
42:07 need to look up the lumens of the star
42:09 Sirius extremely bright that little star
42:14 out there and again uninhibited by any
42:17 atmosphere at all when you're at Lake
42:18 Havasu you're still staring through
42:20 miles and miles of atmosphere so on the
42:24 moon who knows how bright that thing
42:26 would be I think it'd be bright as hell
42:27 okay you don't see any of that stuff the
42:31 astronauts were told when they came back
42:33 for the super depressed debriefing to
42:37 the press Michael Collins said I don't
42:39 think I remember seeing any stars that's
42:43 a ridiculous assertion because even with
42:45 his human
42:46 he should be able to see it when he's
42:48 going from earth to the moon all three
42:50 of them should have been able to see it
42:51 but they're saying they didn't see it
42:53 because that's what they're told it
42:55 covers up for the fact that this
42:56 soundstage cannot recreate the star map
43:00 right now Bart said in his and my
43:03 interview with him that the old books of
43:05 the 70s that had the fake imagery from
43:09 NASA for these missions had two distinct
43:12 colors of black that they had the the
43:16 matted fake in in camera or sorry I'm
43:21 post-production matting of any of the
43:23 i-beams and things that may have gotten
43:25 into the shot they basically covered up
43:27 inside the negative and then it has some
43:30 point has to turn into the actual
43:32 photograph of the actual astronaut
43:33 sitting on the soundstage now what other
43:36 problems do you have with the soundstage
43:38 well the surface of the Moon is going to
43:40 be something that's going to be very
43:42 delicate someone has to make these
43:45 things now there's two different stories
43:48 about this one I have a personal
43:49 bringing to you personally not from some
43:52 other source the other one is that when
43:54 I looked at how NASA was preparing for
43:56 the launch they actually figured out
43:58 that putting bombs in soil and blowing
44:00 them up creates perfect looking craters
44:03 and again I think if you look at my
44:05 episode do craters exist you'll figure
44:07 out that none of these are craters these
44:09 are volcanic eruptions could be caused
44:10 by electrical spouts from the center of
44:13 the the plasma core of the moon or it
44:16 could be just tension just like we have
44:19 volcanoes here but they're definitely a
44:22 surf or the inside of the moon and not
44:25 something that's hit the moon so those
44:27 millions and millions of perfectly
44:28 circular craters that you're seeing or
44:30 not from particles from space hitting
44:32 them hitting the moon surface but the
44:35 other one is is that I bumped into a guy
44:38 that said that when he saw the moon
44:41 missions he said he knew that they were
44:43 fake and this is funny because they met
44:45 him at a house where the individual
44:47 owned the home thinks that they're real
44:49 when I said well tell me why you think
44:52 this was fake and he said I built a
44:53 machine in college that I installed into
44:56 my university and I forgot what the
44:58 university was
44:59 this guy's a famous car painter and he
45:02 said all I did was it was a catapult
45:04 system I put the finest of sand in this
45:06 room and my catapult just through
45:10 varying size of rocks and a particular
45:12 trajectory such that they would always
45:15 perfectly land straight down and again
45:17 this is what doesn't happen on the moon
45:18 this doesn't happen in reality so he
45:20 built the machine to do this very
45:22 specific thing it weighed the rock and
45:24 this okay I got a pitch you in a certain
45:25 way Bo he said when he saw the moon's
45:28 surface in these studio shots he goes
45:32 that was my machine and coincidentally
45:34 NASA bought his machine in 1964 nobody
45:38 knows that little fact oh I do they now
45:41 whether or not they used his machine or
45:42 not will never know but they bought it
45:44 and he said it was a perfect match
45:46 between what he had and what he saw on
45:48 the photographs but let's just say they
45:51 use bombs they use this catapult system
45:52 to create this beautiful surface it must
45:56 remain pristine from all the cast and
45:58 crew during the entire process you can't
46:01 have Nike shoes here and loafers there
46:04 their human foot there you can't any of
46:07 that would reveal the evidence that this
46:10 is fake now some of you are also hip to
46:14 the fact that some of the rocks look
46:15 like they're made of paper mache well
46:17 for those of you who are recently born
46:19 paper mache was a massive form of
46:22 entertainment and crafts at high schools
46:24 and middle schools and grade schools all
46:27 the way through the 40s 50s 60s 70s and
46:30 80s okay so building these things out of
46:33 crumpled up newspapers that have been
46:37 soaked and basically you reduce a
46:38 newspaper to pulp and then you can do
46:40 anything you want with it you can build
46:42 an object out of cardboard and then
46:44 stuff the stuff on the outside and it'll
46:46 look like a rock especially in black and
46:48 white but all of the objects that are
46:51 supposed to be on the moon's surface are
46:54 going to have to be lowered from a crane
46:56 down to the surface the astronauts have
46:59 to be also carried by cable across this
47:03 surface and put on the ladder without
47:06 having stepped on the moon there can't
47:08 be any tracks on the moon until they do
47:11 it themselves
47:12 well the one thing that they screwed up
47:15 and it probably probably would have been
47:18 extremely hard with the set that they
47:19 put together maybe this was intentional
47:21 and I thought no one would ever care
47:23 they could get through this but
47:25 something that we now know as a complete
47:26 sign of proof is that when the Apollo 11
47:29 lunar module came down to the moon's
47:32 surface you've all seen the footage of
47:33 all the dirt scattering underneath you
47:36 know when they looked out the window
47:37 they shot that all this soil from the
47:40 the moon surface flying away but when we
47:43 have pictures of the outside of lunar
47:45 module one there's this little I don't
47:47 know what it is it must have been a
47:48 sheath for the motor cone that comes out
47:53 of the bottom none of the soil has been
47:55 moved underneath this thing and the legs
47:58 which I believe are only for like I said
48:00 five do they had no soil on them and so
48:04 you're they're moving metric tons of
48:06 soil with this 10,000 pound thrust
48:08 rocket supposedly but no stuff is on the
48:11 the legs it's proof that this stuff was
48:14 lowered down by a crane okay but now you
48:19 have to have astronauts inside of these
48:24 suits that are air pressured and they're
48:27 real suits they really probably have 100
48:30 percent possibility of not the radiation
48:33 that they're gonna get out of the moon's
48:34 surface which would kill them but they
48:36 would most likely be able to be pretty
48:38 airtight in these things but the problem
48:40 is is that it probably would weigh so
48:44 much especially if you put the
48:45 environmental pack on that you would
48:47 need one-sixth gravity to be able to
48:49 move freely inside of them any of you
48:52 who have been in a scuba tank you put
48:54 two scuba tanks on you're gonna do a
48:55 really long dive and you try to walk
48:57 around the ship deck especially with a
49:00 big parka suit on that's you know super
49:02 insulated you know inflated you know
49:05 that moving around if you're a scuba
49:07 diver in this space suits in one one
49:09 gravity would be very very tough every
49:12 time they trained in water they were on
49:14 all kinds of harnesses and cables
49:15 because they just simply weigh too much
49:17 and so they have to do something about
49:20 the environmental systems well they just
49:22 take them out they're empty
49:26 well that means you're inside a very hot
49:28 outfit and there was this pathetic opera
49:32 attempt to dismiss the myths and bart
49:36 sibrel put a great video out on his
49:38 channel that proves that the the shadows
49:41 were converging on the moon which means
49:43 they had multiple light sources again
49:45 Hollywood people have put it through
49:46 software and so there's at least five
49:47 sources and five light sources and most
49:50 of shots from Apollo 11 at least but
49:53 these guys are really hot and sweaty and
49:55 on this set where they went out to the
49:57 desert to simulate this the astronauts
50:01 sorry the actors inside these astronaut
50:03 suits are already sweating profusely
50:05 their faces are covered in sweat when
50:07 they pull down the little shield which
50:09 we're gonna get to in a second it covers
50:11 their face so the whole soundstage has
50:14 to be cooled down and I mean cool down
50:17 those of you who have seen the making of
50:19 The Exorcist
50:20 when they wanted to make sure that Linda
50:22 Blair's breath was super cold they had
50:27 to literally chill the room way way down
50:29 so the actors walking around in dresses
50:31 and suits are freezing to death and in
50:35 those sets so the problem with that that
50:38 reveals evidence is that these fans are
50:40 actually blowing the air at the actual
50:45 actual actors that are pretending to be
50:47 the astronauts so every time that they
50:49 jump up and down I wouldn't say every
50:51 single time and the shots that I've seen
50:53 but a lot of them I think they adjusted
50:55 for this the dirt that comes up from
50:58 their feet travels really far away
51:00 really fast as if there's an atmosphere
51:03 on the moon and wind is blowing which is
51:05 obviously not the case but we have this
51:09 other problem is that if you can see who
51:11 these guys are inside the suits then we
51:16 have a problem they're in low orbit
51:18 thrown around tuna cans and faking all
51:20 the shots of the the earth and an
51:24 opposite chronological order of course
51:26 so you can't have the actors on the
51:29 ground being identified
51:31 so the brilliant idea they came up with
51:34 was to to line the inside of the the big
51:38 glass
51:39 face plate that comes down and if you've
51:41 Starcraft fans will know exactly what
51:42 I'm talking about they lined it with
51:44 gold as I understand it creating sort of
51:47 a sunglasses effect their excuse for
51:50 doing this was that it was going to be
51:52 too bright to look down at the surface
51:54 of the Moon and survive now we all know
51:58 that skiing is something that has been
52:01 done long before 1969 and we've all gone
52:04 out with sunglasses on like the ones I'm
52:06 wearing and we're just fine we're just
52:08 fine right
52:09 so this excuse is a bit of a stretch but
52:12 it 100% solves the problem for actors
52:16 being on the soundstage it blocks them
52:19 out now a few of the things that are
52:21 interesting is that the again the
52:23 doorways inside of the the lunar module
52:27 main environmental area where the two
52:30 astronauts are in this particular case
52:31 with Apollo 11 II of Buzz Aldrin and
52:33 Neil Armstrong they never filmed each
52:35 other coming out of the door hole you
52:39 have buzz going down a ladder this is
52:41 the famous shot with five light sources
52:42 which Nvidia did a laughable job trying
52:45 to debunk I mean it's amazing who's in
52:49 on this thing right those that try to
52:51 debunk the moon hoax are in on it
52:52 it's just especially at a corporate
52:54 level right individuals who watch
52:57 YouTube and are simply butthurt about it
52:59 well those are just free agents right
53:01 and you know some of this is gonna be
53:03 repeat from the recent episodes but this
53:05 is all geared at the hoax right
53:07 according to bart sibrel with some of
53:10 the original photographs from NASA from
53:12 the 70s you have two different colors of
53:15 terrain soil you have a brownish soil
53:19 towards the bottom and a blueish soil
53:24 towards the back props there but maybe
53:28 that's reversed but it's one of the
53:29 other but it's all been color corrected
53:31 nowadays with obviously modern software
53:33 and so the hoax has been concealed but
53:37 why were there two colors of soil well
53:41 part of it has to do with the fact that
53:42 you have a physical floor that they're
53:45 stepping on and and doing all this fake
53:48 one half gravity right which is again
53:51 rolling the camera up to act
53:53 these astronauts are still on supports
53:57 so every time they jump up and down
53:59 there's this cable above them it's
54:01 insulating their their fall back down to
54:03 give them the sort of the motion of a
54:07 less than one one gravity look and I
54:11 forgot what mission it was but one of
54:12 the astronauts actually stumbled and
54:14 fell down and they have this little
54:16 thing that they do this little kick up
54:17 thing that they do where they push on
54:19 their hands and then they push on their
54:21 feet they push on their hands and it
54:22 gets them to be upright again what on
54:24 the one of them had fallen down he was
54:26 calling for help from his buddy and his
54:28 buddy is hopping across the set to help
54:31 him out and he reaches down with his
54:33 hand to help him out but before his hand
54:36 ever touches the astronaut whoever was
54:39 handling his wire the guy that was Fault
54:41 that had fallen down
54:42 he pulled too soon and this astronaut
54:44 pops right back up on his feet with
54:47 physics in capability right there's no
54:50 force that he has been able to derive
54:53 from pushing off the soil to get upright
54:55 again so by the time guy guy touched him
54:57 he was already upright big mistake right
55:02 there in our on our eyesight but again
55:04 we want to believe this stuff so we
55:05 believe it right now a lot of people
55:07 think that they saw it on TV so when
55:09 they saw it on TV it was real for Apollo
55:12 11 it was unbelievably pathetic the way
55:17 that we got the initial footage of Neil
55:20 Armstrong coming down that ladder of all
55:22 the footage of all the missions to the
55:24 moon that footage the most important
55:26 footage in the world was the lowest res
55:27 for us awe of the mission as it was
55:30 portrayed on the moon why was it low res
55:33 well one of the technical reasons why is
55:36 that the network's were never allowed to
55:38 have the original feed the original feed
55:42 would reveal where the original feed was
55:44 coming from which was earth to earth
55:45 transmissions from the studio through a
55:48 bunch of pipe lines directly to the
55:50 location where they were actually able
55:52 to see it the way that the footage was
55:55 actually presented to you technically
55:57 speaking was that the network's filmed a
56:00 wall NASA projected their feed from the
56:04 studio on to a wall
56:06 and the networks were allowed to film
56:08 the wall pretty unreal right
56:11 but now logistically speaking Neil
56:15 Armstrong had a Hasselblad on his chest
56:18 which is a big jug in I think it's 110 I
56:22 would say 100 it's a square huge square
56:25 negative I proud of that wrong but I
56:26 grew up with these cameras and the
56:28 negative is almost 3 inches by 3 inches
56:31 so super-high resolution right now we
56:35 may want to do we may wanted to have
56:37 done 2 different things we want a live
56:39 broadcast to this whole situation which
56:41 is going to have at least a 4 second
56:43 delay probably more like 10 12 second
56:45 delay by the time the signal gets to
56:47 earth and has to bounce through all the
56:48 transmission mechanisms but we also want
56:51 to preserve this for time this is you
56:53 know if we really do ever step on the
56:55 moon we want this in 4k right now
56:57 obviously in 1969 we don't have such
56:59 resolutions but what we could have done
57:01 is have a live camera feed and we would
57:05 have a small camera with a very tiny
57:08 amount of film killed at that time it
57:11 could have been a 16 millimeter camera
57:12 that would have been enough to capture a
57:14 super high-res compared to what you saw
57:17 footage now the module itself has plenty
57:23 of stuff on the outside of the system
57:24 now we all know that the radiation would
57:26 have probably exposed all the film and
57:28 all the scenarios have they really gone
57:29 to the moon just been holding a
57:30 Hasselblad right the the solar radiation
57:33 would have gone through the Hasselblad
57:34 in two seconds and just like Madame
57:36 Curie who found out that uranium is
57:38 radioactive by storing it bars on top of
57:41 film in a closed cabinet door and then
57:45 developing the film and finding these
57:47 big overexposed sections where the bar
57:49 was that's what would happen in space
57:50 most likely so at the time okay that the
57:55 modules in low orbit and the soundstage
57:59 is acting out all these actors you are
58:02 having a script begin that two column
58:05 scripts for buzz for Michael and for
58:08 Neil to coordinate with what's going on
58:10 in the studio and it must have been a
58:13 pain in the ass but they probably
58:14 rehearsed it quite a bit but let me loop
58:17 back one second
58:19 the the terrain in the background
58:22 the mountainsides and what have you we
58:24 think were similar simulated by a prop
58:29 that was simply painted to look like the
58:32 actual background and so from certain
58:36 perspectives this is gonna work
58:38 perfectly you're always controlling
58:39 where the camera is in a studio to get
58:41 the illusion that something's going back
58:43 further than it was so the color palette
58:45 between the soil on the ground which is
58:47 probably made of something we can find
58:49 volcan Akash or something we pulverize
58:51 here and the paint that's on the back is
58:54 why these photographs had two different
58:55 colors of soil easily modified in
58:58 software today right but according to
59:01 bart sibrel they went out very cleanly
59:04 inside of inside books back in the day
59:10 the other one I want to draw your
59:12 attention to which is utterly a smoking
59:15 gun of all smoking guns is the blue
59:17 marble shot I think taken from Apollo 17
59:20 and it is the is the clean shot of Earth
59:25 from space and unfortunately for NASA
59:28 there's two gigantic problems with this
59:30 one Google Earth exists today and the
59:34 proportions of Africa in this shot are
59:37 completely off and Madagascar is way
59:40 further north that it would be in
59:42 reality now again if you study the Peter
59:45 projection ramp then you're gonna
59:47 realize that all the shapes of the
59:48 continents are wrong on all of our
59:49 globes and they've been that they've
59:51 been wrong for over 70 years super sad
59:54 on our part that we can't replace the
59:55 Globes with one that's actually accurate
59:57 but that's not the big smoking gun
60:00 the huge smoking gun is the Red Sea I
60:03 believe it's the Red Sea it is a it
60:07 looks like a great lake you know it's
60:09 just kind of a little worn that goes
60:10 left to right east to west and the
60:14 problem for NASA is when they composited
60:16 the shots they have the earth closing
60:18 off the lake opening back up closing it
60:22 off opening back up because it's a
60:23 composite shot of high-altitude planes
60:27 or maybe even low orbit photographs but
60:31 they made a huge mistake
60:33 and coincidentally they fixed that since
60:36 then again a pure shot if I just say I'm
60:40 gonna walk up to you I'm gonna be three
60:42 feet away with my Nikon Zippity zap
60:44 camera that's got a mega you know
60:47 gigapixel whatever I take a picture of
60:49 your face you're not gonna be Picasso
60:51 one day with to your eyeballs on one
60:52 side of your face and then later on it
60:54 just miraculously moves you to have both
60:56 eyes on you know opposite sides your
60:58 head this is what NASA wants you to
61:00 believe now let's start from scratch and
61:03 review very quickly the Saturn 5
61:05 launches three astronauts go in low
61:08 orbit the set on earth is timed
61:11 perfectly with what they think this
61:13 mission is going to would have been had
61:17 there been real the satellite that was
61:19 inserted into space I think in March of
61:23 1969 somewhere in that time frame that
61:25 simulated the entire mission for all the
61:27 ground control people has been either
61:29 relaunched or the data on the satellite
61:32 has either a script to where they were
61:34 able to upload a different script
61:35 probably just had a script to in it when
61:38 the launch happens in July of 1969 that
61:40 satellite is still going around the
61:42 earth and beaming down to all the
61:44 listening stations including NASA
61:45 headquarters and the Russians and all
61:47 this other stuff anyone who wanted to
61:49 monitor this launch is actually getting
61:51 information from a false satellite
61:53 what's a real satellite but it's it's
61:55 not the anything to do with the capsules
61:58 going to the moon so all the precise
62:00 moments they're saying what you could
62:02 you hear this a lot the Russians watched
62:04 us go to the moon well they didn't watch
62:06 us with telescopes and having the module
62:09 go down to the moon and come back up no
62:11 one has that footage that doesn't exist
62:13 what they were watching was the
62:15 telemetry transmissions from these
62:17 supposed spaceships back down to earth
62:19 all being orchestrated by this satellite
62:21 that was used to simulate the full
62:23 mission three or four months before just
62:26 prior to getting to the moon
62:28 quote-unquote in the script
62:29 the astronauts wanna furnish footage of
62:32 the earth getting smaller as if they are
62:35 going away from the earth right well the
62:38 problem is with bart sibrel did his
62:40 movie a funny thing happened on the way
62:42 the moon someone leaked I think a 56
62:44 minute
62:45 movie to him at least the full version I
62:48 saw on YouTube a long time ago which I
62:50 can't find anymore was about that length
62:52 they are using a window a round window
62:56 with a fisheye lens piece of glass in it
62:59 that's obviously going to grab a
63:01 tremendous amount of of the spectrum
63:04 it's a wide angle lens basically of the
63:06 earth now Neil Armstrong says to NASA on
63:10 recording I've pushed the camera lens
63:12 directly against the window and
63:14 everything that you see is earth and the
63:17 black part around Earth is space and
63:19 again can't see the Milky Way can't see
63:21 Sirius which is a complete bunk in
63:23 itself but let's just say you adjust
63:25 your brain to believe that suspension of
63:27 disbelief right the problem for them is
63:30 that they've actually got a gel over the
63:32 right side of the window simulating the
63:34 the Sun creating the you know sun's
63:38 moving to the west and they're
63:39 simulating this ongoing dark on the
63:41 right side of them of the earth but they
63:44 film this with atomic clock stamping in
63:47 the camera in reverse chronological
63:50 order so they filmed the further away
63:51 shots first because it's easier to kind
63:53 of get your ball bearings together get
63:55 the equipment set up and then as they
63:57 perfected the shot they move the camera
63:58 closer and closer to this window and the
64:00 blackness that you see is actually the
64:03 inside of the cabin it's not the edge of
64:05 the earth in this shot you have arms
64:09 that got in the way that moves in front
64:10 of the camera like right now if a third
64:11 person if you're watching this on
64:13 youtube if was put this way if a second
64:15 person was with me and they put their
64:17 hands in front of the lens you would
64:18 know that I'm not by myself in this
64:21 backyard which I am at this point but
64:25 you have shots with arms going between
64:27 the camera and the window you also have
64:30 the red lights that are in the room got
64:33 in the shot at the very last shots they
64:36 turn the lights on in the cabin you see
64:38 someone pulled the gel off the window
64:39 and Michael Collins turns the camera to
64:41 his face it makes a goofy expression so
64:44 basically signify well that's part of
64:47 the hoax that we just finished awesome
64:48 to review when they were supposed to be
64:51 close to the earth they're filming the
64:52 far away shots when they're far away
64:53 from the earth they're filming the close
64:55 shots all in reverse order thus exposing
64:58 the hoax
64:58 someone delete this video either by
65:01 accident or on purpose as Bart described
65:05 that he said that most people that were
65:06 doing moon documentaries were sent giant
65:10 canister stacks of all the footage from
65:13 whatever mission they were interested in
65:14 covering and he said of everyone I've
65:17 ever talked to they only used the first
65:19 two or three cans of this footage but he
65:22 went all the way to the bottom and
65:23 watched every single piece of footage
65:25 and again all he ever asked for was
65:27 Apollo 11 with the assumption that if
65:30 they were gonna make any mistakes
65:31 it obviously would have been on the
65:32 first try and he was right now many of
65:36 you have seen I think it's 16 where
65:40 someone actually walked onto the set
65:42 during the filming and pulled an object
65:45 off the ground walked off the set and in
65:48 the original shot you can see this human
65:49 being at the astronaut over there by the
65:51 lunar lander and this guy walks onto the
65:53 right side of your screen takes
65:55 something off and walks off now some
65:57 people think oh that was faked later on
65:59 you know through After Effects or
66:02 something and this creates this fake
66:04 disinformation when someone rolled back
66:06 the footage that NASA actually broadcast
66:08 what you see is the shadow of the person
66:11 suddenly appear and suddenly go away the
66:14 person has been cropped out but their
66:15 shadow is still in fan testimony
66:17 registering in the original footage so
66:20 we think that that's pretty evident that
66:22 this is obviously a soundstage and
66:24 someone accidentally walked in the shot
66:25 during a broadcast live moment so
66:29 they're in low orbit when someone who's
66:32 watching the clock based on the mission
66:34 idea of the slingshot theory of getting
66:36 to the moon when it starts having to be
66:38 the moon footage the studio kicks on the
66:41 astronauts are given their cues and it's
66:44 got to be a pretty good rehearsal back
66:46 and forth now I wasn't alive when this
66:48 was happening so I have no idea whether
66:50 or not footage from the moon of the
66:52 Vanille Armstrong jumping down the
66:53 ladder with this horrible grainy footage
66:55 okay
66:57 trying to hide the mistakes is basically
66:59 what they're trying to do with super low
67:01 green footage broadcast they get on a
67:03 wall projecting it on a wall making the
67:05 network's take it off the wall atrocious
67:08 right yes but this way there's more
67:11 logistics
67:12 and broadcasting that on the wall and
67:14 hiding its original signal than just
67:15 giving the network's the original signal
67:17 source what's interesting to me is that
67:20 I can't imagine that source being able
67:22 to be encrypted in any way shape or form
67:24 maybe they could Oh No they mess with
67:26 the scan line length the Scylla normal
67:30 television can't process it I don't know
67:31 I mentioned this in episode 26 so I'll
67:34 just mentioned it briefly here the nikon
67:38 or sorry the Hasselblad camera that Neil
67:40 Armstrong had to his chest is a camera
67:43 that is a square box and you have to
67:44 look down inside the viewfinder to see
67:47 if you got the right shot now the amount
67:51 of time life cover shots that Neil
67:53 Armstrong was able to take in a camera
67:54 that held probably about 30 frames per
67:57 roll of film and I was not aware that
67:59 they ever reloaded the camera because
68:02 that is not an easy step you'd have to
68:03 guarantee he would have to be inside the
68:07 environmental capsule with that camera
68:10 to at all get it off of his chest so he
68:13 could see what he was doing in order to
68:15 reload an icon back excuse me a
68:18 Hasselblad back excuse me
68:19 you have to put this silver door into
68:24 the back of the actual film canister and
68:26 then you can disconnect it and it's
68:28 protected to film you can put that down
68:30 grab another one put it on pull this
68:32 little sliver out then you'd have to
68:34 reattach it to your chest right now how
68:37 many of you have shot selfies over and
68:39 over and over again just to get that
68:41 perfect angle of your face and your
68:43 friends or whatever how many of you just
68:45 taken a ton of pictures with your camera
68:47 at Disneyland or the beach or wherever
68:49 the Eiffel Tower and you're trying to
68:51 get the right shot now imagine I give
68:54 you the best camera in the world fact
68:56 I'll give you a Hasselblad now wire it
68:58 to your chest and I say you're a
69:00 Disneyland
69:01 easy tons of stuff to take pictures of
69:03 and I want you to bring me back the
69:05 amount of shots that Neil Armstrong got
69:08 perfectly composed in his camera without
69:09 being able to look down the excuses that
69:12 he was highly trained okay yeah right
69:15 you've never been here before
69:17 you've never done this before you have
69:18 no idea what you're up against you're
69:21 standing on a crater you're up and down
69:24 whatever you're not going to get
69:26 everything cropped perfectly as well the
69:29 gentleman who built the Hasselblad fro
69:31 the moon missions was interviewed on a
69:33 face to face interview I can't find this
69:36 anymore but they asked him what would
69:38 happen if this camera heated up to 250
69:41 degrees Fahrenheit which the day actual
69:43 claim was about 280 I think and then
69:45 went down to 280 below zero and then
69:48 back up the guy said well the camera
69:50 would explode
69:51 they can't handle that that means that
69:54 they couldn't have pulled this off
69:56 because according to NASA this is
69:58 problem with the SpaceX rover and space
70:00 thing or there the Tesla in space you
70:03 can't have metals with this gigantic
70:07 discrepancy and heat and cold it twists
70:10 and expands in the opposite directions
70:12 and so you're gonna have actually an
70:13 object explode at least at least distort
70:18 so much that the shutter isn't gonna
70:20 work inside and nothing's gonna maybe
70:22 even the zeiss lens cracks you know i
70:24 mean if you've had a windshield crack
70:26 when it's really hot out and then you
70:28 accidentally wash your car and it goes
70:29 split right my neighbor had his
70:33 passenger side window explode on his
70:36 truck across the street when he got
70:38 really hot here the other day they
70:40 thought someone actually abused his
70:41 truck but they kind of figured out it's
70:43 probably just got fractured somewhere in
70:44 the construction that he does and then
70:47 when the hot and cold happened it just
70:48 took it all the way but now think about
70:50 the claim that a bunch of people have to
70:53 be in on this conspiracy we're gonna get
70:55 back to the mission in a second but it
70:57 doesn't take much does it I mean it
70:59 takes probably a few hundred people to
71:01 run the the soundstage to get it all
71:03 worked out it takes a lot of people to
71:05 communicate secretly with the the
71:08 capsule in low orbit which we have
71:09 evidence by a third voice that tells the
71:13 astronaut when to talk until he told
71:14 Neil Armstrong to talk
71:18 [Applause]
71:23 because they're trying to when they
71:26 communicate with the astronauts they're
71:27 trying to simulate the time delay of two
71:30 seconds up and two seconds back most of
71:32 the communications are way under four
71:34 seconds which means this couldn't be
71:36 real when Nixon calls the astronauts
71:39 from the White House I think you talked
71:41 the Neil Armstrong he said you know you
71:43 guys are doing great those second delays
71:45 are like half a second a second it's way
71:47 too quick to have this conversation the
71:49 fluidity that they did another sign that
71:52 that's all on earth and it's a big hoax
71:54 so when it comes time to land this is
71:57 one of the things that blows my mind
71:58 about people they'll say something like
71:59 well I how did they splashdown in the
72:02 ocean if they didn't really go to the
72:03 moon and you're like what does the moon
72:06 have to do with splashing down in the
72:08 ocean now before we get to the actual
72:12 splash this this lunar module this again
72:18 cone-shaped craft at the all come back
72:21 in alright is said to turn around so
72:27 there's a black shield on the bottom
72:28 like a shield that's it's designed to
72:30 take amazing temperatures as they're
72:32 coming in at this very perfect angle
72:34 because if they get too shallow they're
72:35 going to bounce off to come in too steep
72:38 they're gonna vaporize
72:39 it's the ship rubbing against the
72:40 atmosphere it's pretty brilliant that
72:42 they figured that out when they got into
72:44 high-speed aircraft they figured this
72:46 out very quickly
72:47 was it the sr-71 is said to be so hot
72:50 it's windshields are so hot you could
72:52 take an egg throw it against the
72:53 windshield and it will cook before it
72:55 falls back down in your lap pretty
72:57 interesting by 1969 as I understand it
73:00 the sr-71 was well in use so they had
73:03 this knowledge right if they're truly in
73:06 low orbit which I think they were as
73:08 evidence of their video of the earth
73:11 through this portal window of course
73:14 they got to come down now
73:17 physicists did a simulation of this
73:21 shape of this bullet shape hitting the
73:24 atmosphere and could not in any
73:26 circumstance throw it at the atmosphere
73:29 in a way that it didn't turn to the
73:31 was down so that's a bit of a mystery as
73:35 to whether or not these astronauts came
73:37 down in an upside-down configuration or
73:39 a bottom configuration maybe there's a
73:42 way to get it to happen with the bottom
73:43 configuration but they splashed down on
73:47 the ocean from a low orbit and for some
73:49 people that was the complete validation
73:51 of all this other hocus-pocus he's bad
73:54 photography all the evidence on the moon
73:56 that it was a hoax the perfect shots
74:00 this ridiculous contraption called the
74:03 lunar lander if you ever just pull up
74:05 the shot of the lunar lander and
74:07 disconnect your mind for a split second
74:10 from what you're seeing as being real
74:13 you'll start to look at this thing and
74:15 go really that's the best they could do
74:18 in terms of coming up with a with a ship
74:22 that looks like you could land on the
74:23 moon and then take back off again right
74:25 because the top part has like some sort
74:28 of explosive with this little I don't
74:30 know I always heard was an explosive
74:31 that just blasted it back up into space
74:33 right this is a maneuver that is
74:36 probably the most volatile dangerous
74:39 thing of the entire mission is to get
74:43 back up into moon orbit and then
74:45 rendezvous with the module and get back
74:48 home work the first time every time and
74:51 no one's ever been able to do it since
74:53 again no other nation on earth has been
74:56 able to go to the moon with computer
74:59 power a million times more intense than
75:02 what they had on those ships our
75:05 rocketry is now profoundly more powerful
75:08 than the Saturn 5 and no one can do it
75:11 now let's go on to Apollo 12 because
75:13 there's a there's a little bit of
75:15 evidence with that 1/2 of the soundstage
75:17 now everything else is pretty much in
75:20 the back launching the Saturn 5 doing
75:23 the low orbit shots and landing back and
75:25 splashing that's locked in no problem
75:28 there I mean obviously it's a super
75:29 complicated thing and hats off to
75:31 everyone who participated in that
75:32 they're all geniuses and without them
75:35 you know this this thing would have we
75:37 never would have any accomplishments in
75:39 space so
75:40 I have big respect for everyone involved
75:42 with this thing up to the point of
75:43 killing Gus Grissom and his buddies but
75:47 they needed to improve on the mission to
75:49 make it more exciting why would anyone
75:51 continue watching missions on the moon
75:53 well according to all of my friends who
75:56 watched it back in the day on TV they
75:59 said that it was SuperDuper stress than
76:00 Apollo 11 that these boosters were
76:02 completely they were at the bare minimum
76:06 of thrust the f1 boosters or the bare
76:08 minimum of thrust to get this thing into
76:09 space and make this entire mission
76:11 possible they even said as I've heard it
76:14 communicated to me from firsthand people
76:17 that saw it that you couldn't bring a
76:18 paperclip now this is an exaggeration
76:20 most likely but they couldn't bring 10
76:22 pounds more on this Saturn 5 and the
76:26 mission and have the mission be
76:27 successful because it wouldn't have
76:28 enough thrust to make all these
76:30 elliptical slingshot orbit theories work
76:32 which I'm not completely convinced that
76:35 actually works at all but whatever so
76:37 what do they bring up in Apollo 12 they
76:41 bring up what I like to call a my
76:43 co-host from MKULTRA radio Kyle said the
76:46 Chrysler they bring up a Jeep it's based
76:50 on the Jeep the military GT you would
76:52 see in like the sitcom mash those little
76:55 jeeps from World War 2 a stripped one
76:57 completely down they realized inflated
77:00 tires aren't gonna work again ingenious
77:01 ideas they come up with this this sort
77:04 of corrugated steel tires just
77:06 unbelievably brilliant it's mostly
77:09 hollow right but you have this I think
77:13 it's about 700 pounds 699 pounds or so
77:16 that goes up on this rocket well they
77:18 didn't adjust the f1 boosters one iota
77:20 between the first mission and the last
77:21 mission so how were they able to put
77:24 this in orbit according to them it was
77:28 impossible again according to them it's
77:30 impossible to do we're just like
77:33 whatever man take out the spaceship
77:34 whatever right well the very first shots
77:37 we ever see of this moon rover lacks any
77:42 tire marks they film the front left
77:44 quarter panel of this vehicle and
77:47 there's no tracks they also don't have
77:50 any footage of actually unloading this
77:52 thing and putting it together
77:54 which it the whole thing supposedly
77:55 folded out right brilliant idea and then
77:59 there's something else you start to
78:00 notice when you look at all the rover
78:02 footage and I mean all of it it looks
78:05 like the astronaut outfit that's inside
78:09 this thing is a dummy I mean it looks
78:13 like a human but it doesn't move as this
78:17 thing is bouncing around and throwing up
78:19 the big rooster tail again it's all off
78:21 of it's all in accurate to one-sixth
78:24 gravity but so you buy that double X is
78:26 a thing again if you take all the Moon
78:28 footage in and you double the play speed
78:31 the 2x which every player in the world
78:33 can do right just download some footage
78:35 and play it 2x you're gonna see real
78:37 time
78:37 that's not one-sixth gravity okay it's
78:40 just not but you don't see anybody on
78:43 this car and if you see this footage
78:44 please send it to me because I watched
78:46 probably God 10 minutes of this stuff
78:49 and I never saw an astronaut wave hey
78:51 how's it going man or or take the wheel
78:53 and really strong arm and here and there
78:55 cause I think I think both arms are on
78:58 it or one arms off you're something like
79:00 this but the thing that the person in
79:02 this vehicle doesn't move like a normal
79:04 human being
79:05 turn in the head like this hey what's
79:06 going on right I mean no you got a
79:08 little bit of restraint from the suit
79:09 but it looks like the they ran like some
79:12 remote control vehicle it might have
79:15 been that when they put a person inside
79:19 the suit and put them on this Jeep and
79:21 then put them on the set that it gets
79:24 stuck like a dune buggy on the beach
79:26 which I see it all the time right people
79:28 arrive these little eighty ATVs or
79:32 whatever they are altering vehicles on
79:34 the beach and you know for the most part
79:36 they're okay but if they know if they
79:38 get in the loose dry sand and sit there
79:40 for a while and crank the tires a couple
79:42 times they're stuck I need people to
79:44 help them get out now what are I'm
79:47 trying to keep this out of the how we
79:49 know all this like all the evidence that
79:51 this was fake because you can watch my
79:52 other episodes where I go through that
79:54 at nauseam but because they made the
79:57 mistakes in Apollo 11 they repeated the
79:59 mistakes and all the other episodes all
80:01 the other missions right which are
80:03 episodes on TV filmed in a soundstage
80:05 the lack of any
80:07 on the feet of the lunar lander they
80:10 kept that mistake going the entire time
80:12 they never even attempted to move soil
80:14 underneath there's at least two missions
80:16 that use the same exact set meaning the
80:19 the mountains in the background which
80:21 are paintings or maybe rear-projection
80:23 are the same and all they did was they
80:27 rustled up some rocks on the ground one
80:30 of the interesting things that I that no
80:33 one really talks about is that the first
80:35 three astronauts came back Buzz Michael
80:38 and Neil and in their press conference
80:40 with the world they again they looked
80:44 like they've been crying and you know
80:46 what that looks like that red face they
80:47 look like they've been crying which all
80:50 three of them all three of them look
80:51 super depressed there wasn't one of them
80:53 that was like giddy and the other two
80:54 were depressed all three of them were
80:56 absolutely just I don't know
80:58 dead with the additional groups of three
81:03 that they put up there we're totally and
81:05 completely into this and they had no
81:08 problem taking the interviews and
81:09 talking about it at length it's very
81:10 interesting now what do they do to make
81:14 us believe today that it was real well
81:18 side from faking more and more evidence
81:20 you know fake shots of the lunar landers
81:23 on on the moon which are four times as
81:26 large as they would normally be on the
81:28 moon you have to understand that when we
81:30 take a picture of a foreign planet with
81:32 a surveillance satellite again this is
81:34 probably all fake but they tell us that
81:37 a pixel equals a certain amount of cubic
81:39 space on the surface of wherever they're
81:41 taking these pictures and so when we
81:44 take the ratio of the pixel
81:47 you know let's say one pixel was a yard
81:49 three feet square and we look at the
81:52 Lunar Module pictures that they brought
81:54 back and we study the four feet that are
81:58 on the lunar module it's four times as
82:00 big as it should be well it didn't just
82:02 grow okay another painful piece of
82:06 evidence but the interesting one that I
82:08 hear a lot about and I haven't got a
82:11 barrage from you guys in a while it's
82:13 usually only the newcomers that do this
82:15 I've mentioned this in previous episodes
82:17 but some of the astronauts have been
82:19 told or elect
82:21 - just to keep this facade going by
82:24 talking about aliens they say this is
82:28 one of the defensive theories that we
82:31 did go to the moon but when we got there
82:33 we found a bunch of alien stuff alien
82:36 like huge sculptures and cities and on
82:39 the black backside of the moon the Dark
82:41 Side of the Moon that there's all kinds
82:42 of alien bases and all this other stuff
82:44 John Lear's all under this kind of thing
82:46 right your problem with logistics of
82:49 this is the following one we have
82:52 telescopes that are massively powerful
82:54 in the amateur astronomy world if there
82:57 is any logical movement on the surface
82:59 of the bright side which is where we
83:01 landed in the Sea of Tranquility and all
83:03 this other locations we'd be able to see
83:05 a craft moving across the surface of the
83:07 Moon now there have been videos
83:10 submitted on YouTube loosely source that
83:12 claim to have this kind of stuff I'm not
83:14 convinced me that's not just someone
83:16 having fun with with footage if you have
83:19 one you think is very believable please
83:21 link it down below in YouTube and I'll
83:23 take a look but the chronology of the
83:25 problem of creating the hoax to protect
83:28 the the alien encounter is the following
83:32 if this was all real and there was there
83:36 would be no soundstage anywhere there
83:38 wouldn't be any soundstage anywhere in
83:40 the world because they really are there
83:41 and they're really taking all these
83:42 shots the idea that over night you know
83:45 Neil Armstrong comes down the ladder and
83:47 he turns around and there's freaking
83:48 Klaatu looking at him or these grey
83:51 aliens looking at him there's not enough
83:52 time to fake all that stuff I told you
83:56 about such that the population doesn't
83:59 have like oh well we'll get you the moon
84:01 footage in a month or six months or
84:03 right all that happened chronologically
84:05 just as we thought it was real you know
84:08 as it was portrayed to us there's no
84:10 time
84:10 to fake all this stuff yeah sure the
84:12 additional missions you could make up
84:13 any story you want but one of the things
84:16 they want you to do is to say well we
84:18 know there's aliens on the moon or I've
84:20 heard a really credible story by some of
84:22 the astronauts okay that went there
84:24 supposedly right there peddling this
84:26 stuff
84:26 I forgot what astronaut lives in Malibu
84:28 but he's the guy that shows up to UFO
84:30 now
84:32 groups and and lies out his teeth about
84:35 all the crap that he saw because if you
84:37 can just automatically assume that
84:39 aliens exists on the moon then that
84:43 validates the moon missions well of
84:44 course when's the moon well how do you
84:46 know that what we saw aliens that part
84:48 is true ok well then everything about
84:50 getting to the moon is true then it's a
84:53 backhanded way of making a lie the truth
84:56 I'm gonna suggest you don't fall for it
84:58 ok now I have a whole episode about the
85:01 moon and its mystery if why it's there
85:03 why it's so huge and there are a lot of
85:05 anomalies with it for those that are
85:08 flat earthers which some of you just
85:11 rolled your eyes there is a mysterious
85:14 thing that you know the moon perfectly
85:16 eclipses the Sun and I mean perfectly
85:19 and again what are the freaking odds
85:21 that we've got this 1200 mile diameter
85:24 ball surrounding our 8,000 mile diameter
85:28 earth it's too big for us the moon is I
85:32 mean the Sun is 93 million miles away
85:34 supposedly and it all just the lines
85:36 perfectly so that this eclipse happens
85:39 hmm there's probably nothing more
85:42 suspicious than the fact that that is
85:44 that those two objects in space are the
85:46 same exact size the my moon episode I
85:50 talk about the theory that the moon is
85:52 actually a burned-out Sun I heard this
85:55 somewhere I thought was utterly
85:56 fascinating it was like yeah so if
85:57 you're gonna replace the Sun if these
85:59 are light bulbs that just basically burn
86:00 out then you would replace it with one
86:02 exactly the same size because that's the
86:04 one that provides the ecosystem for this
86:06 planet that's down here or if it's a
86:09 flat earth disc it's just up there
86:11 rotating somehow right I do think it's
86:15 interesting and I'm just gonna end this
86:16 on a bumper for those of you who hate
86:18 Flat Earth you can just click off the
86:20 video right now but I'll just tell you
86:21 coming in as a super science kid having
86:24 been super privileged to meet utterly
86:27 brilliant people at NASA that have done
86:30 other things there nothing to do with
86:31 the moon missions it fascinates me that
86:35 someone can be so cavalier about the
86:38 Flat Earth thing being wrong I think it
86:41 best if you are discerning scientists
86:45 okay you are you're gonna be you're
86:48 gonna be left with the paradox if you
86:49 really just subtract out of your brain
86:51 everything you've been told is true you
86:53 look at the Peter projection map and you
86:54 realize that our continents on all of
86:56 our Globes are wrong and that there was
86:57 a movement in the early 50s to get all
87:00 of our Globes updated I mean we made
87:02 them a long time ago and so of course we
87:04 didn't have space travel we didn't have
87:06 high-altitude planes and all this other
87:07 stuff to look down and go oh this shit's
87:10 actually a different shape here's your
87:12 problem if you want to be so certain
87:14 about where you are all the pictures of
87:17 Earth from space are fake every single
87:20 one of them there are videos out there
87:22 with the interviews that interviewed the
87:23 latest guy in the last 10 years from
87:25 2018 back to 2008 this young kid who
87:27 does the composite work of of the shots
87:30 of the earth using high-altitude
87:32 pictures either from satellites or from
87:34 planes or whatever and he says on this
87:37 tape well it's a composite it has to be
87:39 it's a composite it has to be it's
87:43 interesting that this that the person
87:44 gifted with this job has no other
87:48 scenario in his mind to take a picture
87:50 of the Earth from space but a geocentric
87:52 orbit satellite should be able to be a
87:54 live feed of Earth and they've attempted
87:56 these live feeds where they say oh
87:58 here's an animation of 24 hours of the
87:59 earth rotating and we find out that
88:01 storm systems have literally been cut
88:03 and pasted over and over and over in the
88:05 same shot so the same unique snowflake
88:07 of a cloud has repeated a bunch of times
88:09 you know pretty far away from each other
88:11 so it wouldn't be any sort of pattern
88:13 that would be a natural phenomenon and
88:15 unless any of you have been an astronaut
88:18 you've never had the opportunity to fly
88:19 up there and see it for yourself so how
88:22 can you be so certain where do we have
88:24 the footage of a plane flying over the
88:26 Antarctica with continuous shot just fly
88:30 over it man just put camera out there
88:31 with some ungodly 512 gigabyte RAM stick
88:36 and just let it film not the door he'll
88:39 go go with a 1980s camcorder they can
88:41 film for eight hours and low definition
88:44 we don't have that footage right now a
88:47 lot of the evidence that has been
88:48 suggested to prove its flat has also not
88:50 been proven the gyroscopes and a plane
88:53 no footage of that just a claim of that
88:56 over and over and over and over again so
88:57 you get some disinfo
88:59 and you get some sort of official
89:03 science info now we do look out into
89:06 space and we see the moon it's a round
89:08 object we see the Sun it's a round
89:10 object we have colleges that fill in
89:13 these things with kids watch it all day
89:14 they watch the Sun rotate right and it
89:17 rotates and you can see it's a big ball
89:19 in space we can see a lot of our
89:22 neighboring planets pretty pretty good
89:23 in a telescope and they're round objects
89:26 they seem to have gaseous sort of
89:29 surfaces with at least Saturn and
89:32 Jupiter right but the real thing I want
89:35 to bumper the end of this thing with is
89:37 this the space agencies of this world
89:40 today are in the picture business and
89:44 the movie business
89:45 they are only selling you once the
89:48 rocket is out of sight and out of mind
89:49 right once it's launched and lost all of
89:51 its vertical lift right you just see it
89:53 falling around the maybe this side of
89:55 the earth I'm gonna be crashing into the
89:57 seat I don't know
89:58 as soon as it's out of sight out of mind
90:00 with especially this little black out
90:01 period that they say they have to have
90:03 which seems ridiculous but whatever
90:05 we'll go with that little thing being in
90:07 necessity I think it was a it was a
90:09 chance for them to change the feeds from
90:11 you know resetting the script well we're
90:13 gonna tell everybody that we can't
90:15 communicate for X number of seconds
90:16 minutes or whatever and then we're
90:17 really just changing to the ground feed
90:19 or we're sinking the two feeds together
90:21 or whatever they're doing but after that
90:24 point all you get is pictures for your
90:26 sixty million dollars a day the Voyager
90:29 satellites again like I've said
90:31 Hollywood had perfected by 1984 I said
90:34 2004 they can my episode unfortunately
90:36 they were able to simulate in a computer
90:40 spherical projections of whatever
90:42 surface that they think that object
90:43 might have whether it be Mars or Jupiter
90:45 or Saturn they were able to do the Rings
90:47 that's no problem it's really just a
90:49 flat plane that's visible when you
90:51 project the spherical drawing on there
90:54 which of the Rings are situated but the
90:57 other thing that struck me the other day
90:58 especially about the Voyager I think
91:00 which I think launched in 1976 the first
91:02 one hey we have amazing artists in this
91:06 world who could take a sphere built out
91:09 of whatever's the most perfectly round
91:11 thing
91:12 could be steel could be wood could be
91:14 anything and they could paint that thing
91:16 to look exactly like whatever we think
91:18 these bodies might look like closer up
91:20 right now I think because Saturn having
91:23 the was the hexagon or the Pentagon or
91:25 whatever it is across the top think it's
91:27 a hexagon it's a spherical calculation
91:32 that's it's deteriorating as the orbit
91:34 of the algorithm actually starts to
91:37 condense on itself again I've said this
91:40 recently I'll say it again because we're
91:41 on this episode when I used to use paint
91:44 applications back in the 80s and all the
91:46 way in the 90s of course obviously till
91:47 today drawing a circle on paint
91:51 applications was fairly decent when you
91:54 would drag the circle very large but
91:56 when you drew them smaller and smaller
91:57 the the there was no anti-aliasing back
92:01 in the day so it wasn't smoothed out
92:02 through you know differential grays in
92:05 this thing it was a binary thing it was
92:07 either black or white pixel as soon as
92:09 you drew it smaller these things could
92:11 not remain circular it was a big problem
92:14 in Photoshop all the way up until
92:15 probably the 21st century or what I had
92:18 to do was draw a bunch of little circles
92:21 and brought big ones and try to shrink
92:23 them down maybe the algorithm for
92:25 scaling was a little bit better but it
92:27 was a problem everything was pretty
92:30 whacked out and I can imagine when they
92:31 were venting these algorithms it didn't
92:33 work out well but it was still amazingly
92:36 convincing right so where could they be
92:39 lying today everywhere Rovers on Mars
92:44 more missions to the moon which are just
92:48 orbital all these different things
92:50 trying to orbit moons from Saturn or
92:55 Jupiter they could all be faked but they
92:59 seem to only greenlight missions that
93:01 are fairly simple for them to use their
93:03 existing platforms to fake right but the
93:08 two points I'm trying to prove in this
93:09 episode is that one not a lot of people
93:11 had to be involved in terms of let's say
93:14 for instance 10,000 people participated
93:17 in the creation of the Apollo project
93:19 that went to the moon they had certain
93:21 hadron collider supposedly has 10,000
93:23 people as well
93:24 well think of the Hadron Collider a
93:27 bunch of people build it they generally
93:29 know what the scientists meant by
93:30 building these Collider these wafers
93:32 that check all this scattering proton
93:34 matter but in terms of the actual sensor
93:37 data going through a bunch of software
93:39 and outputting on a monitor as to what
93:41 you think you actually found well
93:43 there's a lot of places in between the
93:45 pipeline of the collider and the actual
93:46 output data that could be hijacked right
93:49 they could hijack that data and say well
93:51 we want to see is this so we're gonna
93:52 make this little interrupting piece of
93:55 software that goes this is what you saw
93:56 the real data is being pulled off to a
93:59 separate location and looked at perhaps
94:01 for a different objective who knows
94:02 right but they're all we need is a bunch
94:05 of people probably I would say 50 to 100
94:10 maybe to participate in the creation of
94:11 this soundstage that's where most of the
94:14 hoax becomes absolutely laughable in
94:16 terms of the low orbit well that's a
94:18 real mission that's a low orbit mission
94:20 in terms of what they're doing in the
94:22 capsule you only see the capsule if it
94:24 has the transmission coming from it
94:26 right if the transmission is encrypted
94:29 going down to special sources on earth
94:33 that are again bases that we don't
94:34 actually have access to because they're
94:36 military bases then the astronauts are
94:39 simply beaming down to these stations
94:41 that are not in the public domain so we
94:44 can get Neil Armstrong's voice to
94:46 coincide with the script the fascinating
94:49 thing is is that all three men sat
94:51 together during the entire mission to
94:53 the moon every single time but they had
94:56 to simulate the two of them are down on
94:58 the moon and one of them still in the
95:00 orbital capsule around the moon right
95:02 every one of them never goes down so
95:04 Michael Collins never touched the moon
95:05 that's kind of a bummer right but I
95:09 don't know why is that I think Michael
95:11 Collins didn't take an interview at all
95:14 and when bart sibrel tried to approach
95:16 him at a supermarket he absolutely would
95:19 not talk about anything which is against
95:21 it was 40 years after the moon mission
95:23 and he would talk about it and he was 30
95:27 years sorry 30 32 years after he did
95:29 that mission he wouldn't talk about it
95:31 I probably a couple more years after
95:33 that because the other movie astronauts
95:35 gone wild took a couple years to make
95:36 after that first
95:37 but anyway he wouldn't talk about it why
95:40 wouldn't you talk about something you
95:41 did that was amazing why not why not
95:44 level that guy if he's out there
95:46 peddling lies about your missions why
95:48 not sit there and just Occam's razor the
95:50 guy down right instead all the Occam's
95:53 razor turned out to be well if this
95:55 stuff is improbable or impossible you
95:58 must subtract those things whatever you
96:00 have left is what the mission actually
96:02 was which is not there nASA has lost all
96:07 the original footage nASA has lost all
96:09 the original schematics right the f1
96:11 boosters have never been revealed to the
96:14 public the rocks that were donated to
96:16 what was at the Russian ambassador in
96:18 England turned out to be petrified wood
96:21 fake fake fake there must be something
96:25 about the original
96:26 video that they got from the moon that
96:29 if studied if the physical film was
96:31 studied it would be very evident and
96:33 never went to space and again for those
96:36 of you who are pilots remember you have
96:38 to wear a little radiation badge on your
96:41 lapel so that you can study how much
96:44 radiation you've been exposed to as a
96:45 pilot and after 20,000 hours in space
96:47 Aeryn sorry in just commercial airlines
96:50 or flying fighter jets or whatever
96:52 you're pulled out of commission because
96:54 you've received the maximum amount of
96:56 radiation your body is supposed to ever
96:58 receive what would an astronaut feel in
97:01 a 1/4 inch aluminum capsule going
97:04 through the Van Allen belts something
97:06 that nearly killed all the astronauts in
97:08 1998 in the space shuttle but you're
97:11 gonna spend days inside this thing
97:13 because you're doing this big
97:13 loop-d-loop thing through the Van Allen
97:15 belts right and you're gonna head off to
97:17 the moon which has no protection
97:19 whatsoever and you're in this hot and
97:21 you're in this cold and you're not in
97:22 this cold you're gonna die you're gonna
97:25 die SuperDuper fast way before you ever
97:27 get to the moon
97:28 and again it's the only accomplishment
97:31 of man has never been repeated by any
97:32 other nation that should give you a
97:34 pretty good indication of the fact that
97:36 it's a hoax so anyway I hope this
97:38 episode was useful
97:39 you can now answer the question of how
97:41 they did it you can also rebut the fact
97:44 that a bunch of people had to conspire
97:46 to make this thing happen
97:47 yeah it's more than perhaps a small
97:51 group of people but it's not a massive
97:52 group of people and by no means the
97:54 overwhelming majority of people again
97:56 remember probably 97 to 99 percent of
98:01 everyone who participated in these
98:02 missions could be interviewed and they
98:04 would pass the polygraph test because to
98:06 them they saw the evidence that they
98:08 needed to see in order to prove to them
98:10 that these missions actually occurred
98:12 but none of them actually saw it those
98:14 of you who are so certain the world's a
98:16 heliocentric ball it's only through
98:18 logic presented to you by the science
98:20 community with the capital as the new
98:22 religion that makes you feel like you're
98:24 on a ball explain to me how the moon
98:27 perfectly eclipses the Sun okay just do
98:32 that for me if you haven't been to deep
98:35 thoughts radio.com
98:35 please go there's audio video a locked
98:38 Facebook group and a patreon page for
98:40 those of you support me in any way shape
98:41 or form thank you very much your
98:43 comments have been amazing shows off to
