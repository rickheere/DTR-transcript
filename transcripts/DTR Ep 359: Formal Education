00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen I'm flipping the angle today
00:39 because I watched some old videos and it
00:41 looks kind of cool from this angle
00:44 plus you can see my lovely hose right
00:48 here tonight I'm going to cover
00:51 something that is something I run into a
00:54 lot and it's sort of ironic and funny
00:59 that I run into a lot because it's about
01:03 formal education at this point that's
01:07 what I'm gonna call the episode I might
01:09 think of like a couple of the words to
01:11 kind of make sure people understand what
01:12 I'm talking about but again there's an
01:15 every step asad sort of a little
01:17 treasure hunt the premise of this
01:21 episode is the following or the theme or
01:25 the guideline in my life I run into tons
01:29 of people who lack formal education
01:32 which in the United States of America is
01:34 defined as you have at least a
01:36 bachelor's degree and they talked to me
01:40 as if I have one and they're sort of
01:44 either directly apologizing for not
01:47 having one and not in terms of an
01:49 employer situation but just even a close
01:51 friend of mine recently was talking to
01:53 me and it just kept going on and on and
01:56 on about how I didn't have a formal
01:58 education I just kept saying well you
02:01 know I don't have one and he just kept
02:03 going on well I don't have one you know
02:05 in his mind he has built up this degree
02:09 as something that he needs kinda
02:13 something needs to apologize for like
02:15 he's a lesser human being now who is
02:17 this individual well he's nearly my age
02:20 he's an extremely successful person at
02:24 what he does and he has never needed it
02:29 but now he is getting a little older and
02:31 what he does involves a lot of physical
02:33 effort and so I'm sure he's feeling the
02:36 aches and pains and any blow out joints
02:39 every once in a while got a couple
02:41 friends in this kind of work a lot of
02:43 outside construction work it starts to
02:46 get scary in the United States of
02:47 America
02:48 I'm sure this is the case in many places
02:50 around the world because this is the
02:52 land of opportunity not the land of
02:54 socialism and so we're you know 40 years
03:00 ago this was coming to an end
03:03 50 60 70 years ago you could get a job
03:06 anywhere in the world anywhere excuse me
03:09 in the 50 States of America once we
03:12 acquired the last two and you could work
03:15 at the post office your whole life you
03:16 could build cars your whole life you
03:19 could do anything your whole life and
03:21 then you had a pension and you run off
03:24 and retire and you retire way sooner
03:27 then you would retire today which you
03:29 know you'll hear me vacillate in my
03:33 opinion it doesn't really bounce like
03:34 that much but you know retirement for me
03:37 should be something you only do if
03:39 you've got something equally I should
03:44 say thought-provoking to do after you
03:48 retire unless of course you're being
03:49 forced out for physical reasons like
03:50 I've said there but if you don't use
03:54 your mind you lose your mind in the
03:57 Midwest because I came from a small town
04:00 like I always say we get to see things
04:02 that people don't get to see as clearly
04:04 in the big city because we see it in in
04:07 the case of everyone's grandmother or
04:10 everyone's grandfather went through this
04:11 particular phase the number one cause of
04:16 death for men in my hometown was heart
04:21 disease you know working really hard
04:23 their whole lives and just basically
04:25 physically expiring but it usually had
04:28 to do with bad eating habits and
04:30 congenital issues of how their body
04:33 metabolizes all this horrible food now
04:37 the ladies for whatever reason seldom
04:39 died of any physical problem where it
04:42 was I mean like their heart stopped
04:43 pumping or you know some sort of like
04:47 trivial thing but after they got to this
04:51 brilliant stage of banning or not
04:53 banning but suggesting that everyone
04:55 throw away all things that are healthy
04:57 sre or eating everything that was
04:59 unhealthy don't eat butter eat margarine
05:00 don't eat the yolks of an
05:02 eat the whites you know all this stuff
05:04 within five years the mental aptitude of
05:09 people started to deteriorate not eating
05:12 the yolk of an egg and then using
05:15 aluminum appliances in your house was
05:17 too huge coos on the American people one
05:22 we stopped eating the cholesterol of
05:24 which the great matter in our brain is
05:25 comprised of greatly which means we got
05:29 with something called neural tangling
05:30 which started to kick off dementia
05:32 started to kick off Alzheimer's and then
05:36 by using aluminum appliances and getting
05:38 little little tiny molecules of this
05:40 stuff in your body it accumulates in the
05:43 brain and then you get Alzheimer's every
05:47 Alzheimer's brain when opened up and
05:49 studied has an aluminum accumulation
05:52 problem hmm
05:54 but formal education is very interesting
05:59 because I I lucked out you know I either
06:05 came from a family line that really
06:07 loves information education or you know
06:11 there's probably a genetic trait there
06:13 but there was also just not having any
06:16 brothers and sisters and having parents
06:18 that were very into themselves and
06:20 essentially said go entertain yourself
06:22 and I'm very happy about this right it
06:24 might like I'm complaining but they had
06:26 their individual lives and they
06:27 basically said you need to have your
06:28 individual life hmm very powerful I
06:34 remember I remember like it was
06:36 yesterday being seven or eight years old
06:39 I believe I was seven he just moved out
06:41 into the country in a very nice house
06:43 and I walked up to my mom and she was
06:45 making me a sandwich or something or
06:48 making herself something I can't
06:49 remember but I was standing next to the
06:50 toaster which is next to the
06:51 refrigerator and I said mom I'm bored
06:54 and she just looked at me and said well
06:56 you got to go find something to do and I
06:59 remember saying well what do you mean
07:00 Jesus well yeah blow those toys go play
07:03 with them and I said and then she said
07:05 to me when I was a kid I used to play
07:07 post office and I would get letters and
07:10 I'd write letters and put them in
07:11 envelopes and then run around and
07:13 deliver them around the house or
07:15 yeah she was an only child until she was
07:18 nine and then of course having babies in
07:20 the house she can't exactly play with
07:22 them so she had to wait another five
07:23 years she was well into her teens before
07:25 she had a companion to play so she
07:27 really spent her life in the same vein
07:29 my father his brother was 12 years old
07:31 within him still is and you know he had
07:35 his pastimes so you know I ended up
07:38 playing with my toys
07:39 luckily Legos was invented and so I'd
07:42 create all these worlds I didn't get the
07:45 full coup de Gras I mean isn't it this
07:48 is good too because I lived out in the
07:49 country and so I spent a lot of my time
07:51 outside hanging out with my friends I
07:53 had a girl lived to the right and I do
07:55 that live two houses down didn't know
07:57 anybody else in fact my grandmother used
07:59 to live in the house the guy moved into
08:01 and then she moved back in town and my
08:05 buddy's family moved in there so first I
08:08 was hanging out with the girl we've
08:10 learned about a bunch of stuff about the
08:11 human body we shouldn't have at that age
08:13 but whatever and then my buddy was real
08:16 interesting because he was sort of like
08:20 a I don't know he was a weird kid he had
08:24 several brothers and her several sisters
08:26 Cuse me again about three sisters and he
08:28 had a father it was very passive very
08:30 like Sonny Bono kind of dad and my
08:33 father was former military so he he
08:37 didn't mess around and I remember one
08:39 time it's just a little digression to
08:40 show you what I learned
08:41 okay this all has to do with the
08:44 foundation of things that you have in
08:47 your life that actually helped you
08:50 succeed or help will help you succeed
08:52 prior to a formal education because I
08:56 really want to take the stigma out of
08:58 you don't have a formal education today
09:01 getting a formal education is sort of
09:04 like me telling you all right you see
09:07 this pond and we're off on Africa
09:09 somewhere or South America somewhere was
09:11 a bunch of piranhas in there and I want
09:13 you to swim across it's probably about
09:15 100 yards I want you to swim across and
09:18 you know hopefully make it man because
09:21 that's how bad formal education is now
09:23 but there is a filter to formal
09:25 education which we're going to get to
09:26 which will almost guarantee
09:28 a successful career but one day were
09:32 hanging out in my bedroom we're chilling
09:34 out and my father for whatever reason
09:36 didn't trust this kid cuz he was sort of
09:38 slimy and he isn't slimy today but he
09:42 will he just put off a weird vibe let's
09:44 split that way and my father had a lot
09:46 of valuables in the house and so he was
09:48 he wasn't working on a car and we're
09:50 inside it's a beautiful day in Kansas
09:52 and he's like he comes in he goes I
09:54 don't want you guys come on site come on
09:56 go outside that remember going alright
09:59 you know no problem with me I got a
10:01 motorcycle whatever we can do something
10:03 about eight years old and my friend
10:08 wasn't gonna move he was sitting on the
10:11 bed got a captain's bed well anything
10:13 you guys remember that thing a little a
10:15 secret hideout underneath it right and
10:18 he's just sitting there and my dad's
10:20 smart enough to know well I can't wait
10:22 touch anyone else's kid but it is the
10:23 70s so you know most parents kind of get
10:26 along with you know various amounts of
10:30 discipline in the neighborhood but he's
10:33 not moving and my dad's is big dude and
10:35 so he raised his voice finally and he
10:39 just let this kid know look if you don't
10:40 get the [ __ ] off that bed I'm gonna
10:42 [ __ ] get you the [ __ ] off that bed
10:43 and so you better go and he finally
10:46 responded went outside I remember my
10:49 friend was kind of shocked but he was
10:50 kind of shocked in that sort of mellow
10:52 kind of way man it was like me and your
10:54 dad's really [ __ ] intense man you
10:56 know something to that effect oh yeah
10:58 well you know we got to go outside what
11:00 the hell's wrong with falling the
11:00 [ __ ] rules dude it's not like he's
11:03 asking us to you know kill the cat or
11:05 something for one year later as I've
11:08 said several times on the show my
11:10 parents moved to a city about a hundred
11:13 miles away and then they got divorced
11:16 and in the spite of the fact that money
11:21 was extremely tight and money played a
11:22 huge factor my parents divorcing I don't
11:25 even remember the event like my parents
11:29 bought a World Encyclopedia and they may
11:31 have bought it for themselves but it
11:33 ended up in my mom's apartment and she
11:35 had this really cool bookshelf at one
11:38 point and I remember looking at it and
11:41 it was a through Z's
11:42 super easy for me to understand and we
11:44 were just pulling a book out and opening
11:46 it up I had all these diagrams and all
11:49 this information is basically WikiLeaks
11:51 today right just go to Britannica
11:53 something below all my [ __ ] moon hoax
11:54 videos by the way they put a goddamn
11:56 disclaimer underneath by a reptilian
11:59 alien episode so just go to the channel
12:03 and select you know type in search on my
12:05 channel and search on reptilian and look
12:07 at it they put a little disclaimer
12:08 underneath my video well geez the deep
12:12 stay worried about something why the
12:13 [ __ ] do you have to clarify that with
12:15 your you know anti or your total
12:17 propaganda thing so I start farming
12:20 through that thing and as you know am I
12:21 gonna go through all the stories again
12:22 but I learned the two main subjects I
12:26 remember reading and I read tons of that
12:28 thing was sort of nuclear physics the
12:34 the basis of you know subatomic physics
12:38 and it got me started in sort of the the
12:40 generic what's fission what's relativity
12:44 with special relativity all these things
12:46 I don't think I bumped into black holes
12:47 until few years later and of course I
12:51 had this genius uncle and he took me
12:53 into quantum mechanics the second he
12:55 heard that I was going into the Einstein
12:57 run because he goes you got to learn how
12:58 it really works now but I didn't have
13:01 anyone there telling me that I was too
13:03 young to read things and what was
13:05 interesting was that my ability to read
13:08 scientific books was nearly fluent at a
13:11 young age and I'd not sure how because I
13:13 mean I my education was nothing special
13:15 I didn't have parents that read me
13:18 stories at night if that if you have any
13:19 questions there one thing my parents did
13:22 that was super damn cool when I was a
13:24 kid when I was about I probably say
13:26 two-and-a-half to maybe five or six they
13:31 won put the alphabet on the ceiling you
13:33 know the big line so it was going
13:34 through that whole thing and then they
13:37 put all the instruments on the wall
13:39 these pictures of instruments and my dad
13:41 would be like what's this French horn
13:42 what's that - was this and so that was
13:46 interesting so that's sort of memory
13:47 game and building my memory worked out
13:49 and oddly enough when I did this with my
13:52 daughter I didn't do the instruments
13:54 because I couldn't find those but did
13:55 the planets across
13:58 her bedroom did all the stars in the
14:00 ceiling so it's really cool
14:02 and she learned those in two seconds it
14:04 was great she knew them it would have
14:06 conversations with adults that didn't
14:08 know the nine planets right but I taught
14:11 her the alphabet and she learned the
14:12 alphabet probably at four or five easy a
14:14 through Z boom boom boom sang the song
14:16 and then she forgot them it was weird
14:20 like two years later she couldn't get
14:22 like halfway through it and then she
14:24 finally souped up and and became a
14:26 little genius of her own so education
14:29 was in my life by the time I again I
14:33 told you I flunked seventh grade and so
14:35 that was very you know it's like an ego
14:38 check for you you're kind of like a mom
14:40 Jesus am I an idiot Christ I mean one
14:43 F's one thing but five FS is a whole
14:45 different game but what I did come back
14:47 to the Midwest because I then bolted to
14:49 Massachusetts that's where I failed I
14:50 came back back to my hometown which was
14:53 cool I'm not in that other town I had a
14:55 lot of fun Derby Kansas let me tell you
14:57 that's where I discovered arcades and
14:59 stealing yes I was a huge little deviant
15:03 kid and in the old in the olden days
15:07 nothing like the bangers today but by
15:11 the time I got back got into eighth
15:12 grade we took out an English class I
15:14 started acing again and I was like okay
15:16 I guess I'm smart you know and I was
15:18 told that a lot of teachers you know
15:19 when I came back my father was like man
15:20 I this chicks would know for being
15:22 really really hard I think one of the
15:24 women who taught junior high taught my
15:26 father and he was like you know she was
15:28 rough so you'd be good and you pay
15:30 attention sure enough paid attention she
15:32 end up loving me it's great but I had a
15:35 little anomaly happen I had two
15:38 anomalies actually one my uncle brought
15:42 home the again the u99
15:43 Texas Instruments 99 for a and that's
15:45 when I did my first art work in binary
15:48 and then started coding and then all of
15:50 a sudden you know it's like a frequency
15:52 I start noticing computers everywhere my
15:54 father's company had a lot of computers
15:56 the colleges had computers but I had you
15:59 know I went up to Massachusetts got out
16:01 of the you know the was at 413 School
16:04 District Education from my hometown
16:08 and then I went over this other you know
16:11 talented three grades and went to
16:12 Massachusetts did two grades to
16:14 different schools there and then when I
16:16 came back I was out of the system and so
16:19 I started taking classes and I realized
16:22 that other kids were in it more advanced
16:24 classes especially mathematics they were
16:26 doing pre-algebra which I never took
16:28 then they were already in algebra and by
16:31 the time I got to my sophomore year I am
16:35 my father start teaching me algebra in
16:37 third grade at home and I was just a
16:39 whiskey up with that [ __ ] you know I
16:40 hated it but it was it was fun you know
16:42 solving for both sides of the equal sign
16:44 blah blah blah and of course you get
16:46 into the utter bore fest called
16:48 simplification I was going to tell you
16:51 tell you algebra is purely to make you
16:54 think it you'll never use it in your
16:56 lifetime I swear to Christ programming
16:59 videogames and trajectories and all
17:01 kinds of wild you know 3d transitional
17:05 matrixes for various and you never touch
17:08 algebra it is like the biggest [ __ ]
17:10 waste of time ever now geometry and trig
17:13 geometry you'll use the [ __ ] out of that
17:15 stuff and that's a lot of fun physics
17:18 absolutely
17:19 calculus yes statistics yes probability
17:23 yes
17:24 fun stuff when it when it attaches to
17:26 real life it man it just clicks in your
17:28 brain right so I realize kids were going
17:32 ahead of me but then I was doing a bunch
17:34 of [ __ ] at home the kids couldn't even
17:36 conceive of programming programming real
17:39 products man I would design a product
17:41 write out the features you know in one
17:44 case at 32 K and when one of the
17:46 computers at 64 K and these are
17:48 full-blown products if I had a father
17:50 who was an entrepreneur he would have
17:52 looked at these products and went Jesus
17:54 let's put a little ad in the back of a
17:55 magazine sell it and just sell the [ __ ]
17:57 out of discs I mean I made all kinds of
18:00 stuff I've mentioned it several times
18:02 won't bore you again I got into school
18:05 into sorry into high school and you know
18:09 there's a point where they kind of let
18:10 you pick your pick your classes but then
18:12 there's over some [ __ ] counselor
18:14 Overlord that tells you what you can and
18:16 can't take because you have prerequisite
18:18 you have to take great and they had
18:21 lined up
18:21 stuff that didn't didn't matter they had
18:25 lined up
18:25 you can't take geometry intake until you
18:27 take algebra one you can't take trig
18:30 until you take algebra two and I was
18:32 like [ __ ] those things have nothing
18:34 to do with each other I can take both at
18:35 the same time so starting off of my
18:38 sophomore year I in fact they just
18:40 literally told me to my face she can't
18:42 do that you can't get into both those
18:43 classes all right so I did it anyway and
18:48 I took to math classes trying to haul
18:51 ass to my senior year but because I was
18:53 behind even doubling up and taking 6
18:56 math courses plus physics and
18:57 programming and also the [ __ ] on the
18:59 side astronomy soundwaves I still
19:02 couldn't get calculus and statistics and
19:04 probability before high school was over
19:06 I had to teach that to myself through
19:09 life's necessity to have those
19:12 calculations done right but what I did
19:16 was the following when I was at home in
19:19 the 80s I remember was gonna sound funny
19:22 when the album Chaka Khan came out
19:24 though you know they're the one that's
19:26 really famous in the eighties that was
19:28 the exact timeframe where I was at home
19:31 especially in the wintertime where
19:32 there's nothing you can do outside in
19:33 Kansas and I was programming my ass off
19:36 I got the command sheet to my little
19:38 Coco
19:39 you know Coco to trs-80 computer
19:42 devoured the thing man I was like I
19:44 wrote a program used every single
19:46 command to the best of my ability same
19:48 thing with the Apple two's but um I got
19:51 to the IBM PC like I said in the Pascal
19:54 world it was just kind of learning how
19:57 the outer structure language of Pascal
19:58 worked and everything else was just the
20:00 same little algorithms and so at a
20:01 really young age I learned holy [ __ ]
20:03 there are patterns to programming you
20:06 learned the pattern on one computer you
20:07 can port it to another computer now
20:09 fortunately I got in a little bit before
20:11 object-oriented programming became a
20:13 thing Smalltalk had come out in the
20:15 early 80s and I didn't get a chance to
20:19 touch it until it became pretty much
20:21 objective-c
20:23 now I go through 25 minutes of all that
20:27 because I got to move to California at
20:31 18 years old technically seventeen two
20:34 weeks later I became
20:36 and within two months I got a job at a
20:40 software company first it was tech
20:42 support but right away people were like
20:44 okay this kid can code and you can draw
20:47 so let's have him draw the fonts the
20:49 icons and let's teach in our custom
20:52 assembly language that was invented to
20:54 program all those tax forms and TurboTax
20:56 at the time we only had federal I think
20:59 we just crossed over it maybe the state
21:02 line within the next year but we were
21:04 inventing the Windows version from
21:05 scratch and so again if you ever ran
21:08 that product back in the day was called
21:09 tax view back in the day every single
21:12 font was mine every single printer font
21:14 on both products was mine and it was a
21:17 weird thing because I'm sitting there a
21:20 really young kid pimples on my face and
21:24 I remember going to lunch after I got
21:26 promoted into engineering officially
21:29 because I was doing this thing called
21:31 encoding is what they called it and
21:33 people didn't really pay too much
21:35 attention to me and then finally they
21:37 assigned the Apple 2gs platform to me
21:39 which we only released on because we
21:40 thought that could be ever was gonna do
21:41 or a while and I was porting the code
21:43 over from the Mac I'm like 19 years old
21:46 I think at the time and I remember going
21:48 out to lunch fairly quickly with the
21:50 engineering team and someone asked me if
21:55 my high school ring was my college ring
21:58 and I was like no I haven't gone to
22:01 college it oh okay
22:04 and he really say much else there's no
22:06 alkaloids or anything waiting for me at
22:07 the end of that conversation but it
22:09 started dawning on me that people
22:10 thought I was gone to college and then
22:12 at that ring comment happens several
22:14 times where'd you go to school
22:15 where'd you go to school every time I
22:17 mentioned what I did where'd you go to
22:18 school and then asking me what high
22:20 school they're asking me what college
22:22 later in life about 1992 I had moved to
22:27 the Bay Area and I had a pretty steady
22:30 job
22:30 and I had access to De Anza College so
22:34 technically speaking I want one semester
22:36 in Ventura Community College but due to
22:39 a funding miscalculation from my parent
22:41 who was helping me do that we didn't
22:44 have the money to get through the whole
22:45 semester so I ended up having to bail
22:47 out on four
22:49 but I think I trudged through the De
22:51 Anza College for about two years maybe
22:54 two and a half before it was all over
22:55 and I was really trying to get my
22:58 credentials in well try to get credits
23:01 in the programming room which I did I
23:04 didn't take it anywhere then I end up
23:06 just having fun taking German and
23:09 sociology albeit kind of AAA stuff so I
23:12 took psychology sociology and then
23:15 astronomy right then that was it my but
23:22 four-year degree people would call sub
23:24 formal education and junior colleges was
23:27 absolutely over I can't say a lot of
23:30 what I learned in those computer courses
23:33 changed my life I did learn some old
23:35 algorithms which weren't used anymore
23:38 the meanwhile I'm writing the core
23:41 product that pays everybody's bills at
23:43 the company I was working for so why are
23:46 people so hung up on formal education
23:49 hmm are they stuck in sort of a class
23:52 structure in their mind do they see
23:55 something when they have conversations
23:58 with other people do they feel like
24:01 they're not as intelligent as other
24:03 people perhaps their languages and is
24:04 developed I don't know what what makes
24:06 it happen so let's take a break from
24:09 that now let's run over to folks they
24:12 get formal education hmm I have no idea
24:17 when the college education is turned to
24:19 crap and how do i define that I define
24:24 that is a bunch of degrees were invented
24:26 that have absolutely no trade skills
24:27 applied to them or that match up to them
24:31 hmm that's a bummer man I'm actually
24:34 getting a full degree and you can't get
24:38 a job because what you got a degree in
24:40 is jobless you didn't become an attorney
24:43 a chemist a doctor and you're not going
24:48 to become a professor and what you got
24:50 your degree in that's another way to
24:53 escape real life right with your filter
24:57 from this point forward for your kids
25:00 your grandkids your friends kids
25:02 and maybe if you're still a kid your
25:04 filter is this if you can't find a trade
25:08 skill that is attached to the degree
25:10 that you're going to get and if you
25:12 don't look at the demand for that trade
25:15 skill before you engage in the degree
25:17 then you might be setting yourself up
25:20 for a big debt book with the you know
25:24 student loan program which means you're
25:27 gonna enter the world with two giant
25:29 obstacles in front of you one you're not
25:32 going to be able to earn much money too
25:34 you're gonna have this gigantic debt on
25:36 your back so you're gonna be trying to
25:39 pay for your necessities of life and
25:41 you're gonna have this blood sucking you
25:44 know loan go now luckily some of these
25:46 student loans have teeny tiny payments I
25:48 mean I had a girlfriend once that they
25:49 got a $50 payment on hers and not you
25:52 know it's interest-free but still it's a
25:56 horrible thing to walk around with you
25:58 know even $15,000 worth of debt if you
26:01 had a college degree in the 90s
26:03 sometimes you got to take three of those
26:04 out so you're sitting there walking
26:07 around with forty five thousand dollars
26:08 in debt and you don't have a job yet now
26:13 there are some degrees those trade
26:14 skilled degrees especially where a
26:16 formal education is sort of the only way
26:21 you can efficiently get the information
26:24 you need to perform the duties of the
26:26 job obviously if you're going to be a
26:29 scientist of any kind well think about
26:31 it
26:32 could you teach yourself all that
26:33 science I mean the you know every bit of
26:36 it well you could potentially
26:39 potentially but who's gonna know are you
26:42 gonna know do you have a course you buy
26:43 from someplace and then you follow all
26:45 the rules well then you're kind of
26:46 getting a formal education if you try to
26:48 do it by yourself and you miss something
26:50 well Christ if you're a chemist you
26:52 might makes two things together to blow
26:53 up and kill you or just aspirate and
26:55 choke you out right you certainly can't
26:58 perform any type of medicine or even
27:02 mental medicine psychiatry psychology
27:04 without having formal degrees that give
27:07 you the formal certification to open
27:09 your business hmm
27:11 well those are actually that's actually
27:14 good news
27:15 right because if you're interested in
27:17 those things you go get those degrees
27:19 that debt doesn't matter because you're
27:20 gonna be cranking out made your
27:21 paychecks okay
27:22 yeah malpractice insurance you're gonna
27:25 have to get and that's a scam you
27:27 [ __ ] game and because everyone knows
27:28 how to gank the system you might have
27:30 some bad patients that are just there to
27:31 fall down and sue you right but isn't it
27:35 interesting that in the United States of
27:38 America technically speaking you're
27:40 supposed to get a certification before
27:42 you can call yourself an interior
27:44 designer some of you may not know that
27:46 you do isn't that amazing
27:50 but you don't have to have a
27:52 certification to call yourself a
27:54 computer engineer which parts gonna do
27:58 more damage potentially someone programs
28:01 some ATM to hand out money you do some
28:04 bank algorithm that robs everybody blind
28:06 we had a program when I told you I was
28:09 in pharma and when I went over to
28:11 clinical studies we had a separate group
28:13 that was handling manufacturing the real
28:15 manufacturing and someone we had well
28:18 actually there was a bug in the product
28:21 where if you change the value of a
28:24 variable the product is supposed to
28:26 update the variables value you know
28:28 supposed to redraw it if you update it
28:30 in memory well there was a version that
28:32 had a bug and it wasn't doing it now you
28:35 could always explicitly say redraw and I
28:38 always did that just because I never
28:39 trusted the system in the first place
28:41 way before the bug ever existed but they
28:44 had a manufacturing app where someone
28:46 was sitting on the manufacturing floor
28:48 and they were ordering supplies you know
28:52 10,000 pounds of an active ingredient or
28:54 an inert ingredients to make a pill out
28:56 of and the thing wasn't redrawing but
28:59 every single time they pushed the order
29:00 button the odor was getting placed and
29:02 ended up having like you know 60,000
29:05 units of this stuff showing up on all
29:07 they wanted was 6 because the person was
29:10 like it's not working right well it not
29:15 it wouldn't necessarily be a
29:17 certification that would stop that error
29:19 from occurring but geez when the
29:21 liability comes around as to what are we
29:23 gonna do with all his crap it might help
29:26 the process if you did have some sort of
29:29 education but then certifications just
29:31 turned into mafias don't they and let me
29:34 give you a little digression into that
29:36 so you'll understand in the state of
29:39 California not on my home state you
29:42 cannot get a pair of glasses replaced if
29:46 I broke these glasses I couldn't get the
29:49 lenses replaced unless I had had an eye
29:51 check in the last two years I think they
29:55 want to make it one year so I got to pay
29:57 for the whole process of checking out my
29:59 eyes now I'm over 40 so I need to do
30:01 that probably every year let alone every
30:03 two years but my uncle who was a master
30:06 optometrist this dude you know that
30:09 little thing he puts up to his eye and
30:10 it shoots a little beam of light into
30:11 your eye he could just walk up to you
30:14 and do this and he would know your
30:16 prescription in two seconds he says I
30:18 was one of the best in my class doing
30:20 this it's just insane he takes that you
30:22 know the the thing it puts up to your
30:24 face with all the lenses and he just
30:25 dial it right in and then it would be
30:27 perfect and if you turned it any other
30:28 way it looked like [ __ ] so that's how
30:31 good he was and he said look pretty much
30:34 from the age of 20 to about 35 he goes
30:37 your eyes are gonna be exactly the same
30:38 but about 35 your eyes gonna start
30:41 taking a [ __ ] real slowly but it keeps
30:42 ramping up right it's a huge bummer now
30:47 again we're not genetically engineered
30:48 to read writing on a piece of paper I
30:50 hate to break that to anybody but what
30:53 they did in California in order to give
30:54 all the optometrists this huge financial
30:56 bump is to insert by via via the the
31:01 optometry Association of whatever this
31:05 mandate that you have to have a an eye
31:07 exam even if you have perfect 20/20
31:09 vision you're constantly checking your
31:11 eye vision you constantly given that 80
31:12 bucks or 150 bucks over for no goddamn
31:15 reason at all right and you should know
31:18 this is a little a little piece
31:21 information sorry for anyone is enough
31:23 optical dispenser or an optometrist who
31:25 makes money from selling lenses which
31:27 really isn't the case anymore except for
31:29 small towns if you paid $300 for a frame
31:32 and that dudes paying a hundred bucks
31:34 it's a 2x markup and that's the way it's
31:36 always been LensCrafters is probably a
31:38 four to five hundred
31:42 cent markup lenses they cost
31:45 they cost $35 for a pair of lenses back
31:48 in 1995 probably up to 2000 I was buying
31:52 my cost from my uncle probably up to
31:55 about 2005 it still was 35 bucks so
31:59 let's just add 15 dollars it's 50 bucks
32:01 for a pair lenses well what do they want
32:03 to charge you 250 300 just for the
32:06 lenses and all the scratch proof stuff
32:08 which doesn't [ __ ] work anymore total
32:10 mafia so there's that kind of stuff too
32:12 that'll insert itself into your career
32:14 now if you're in that career you'll love
32:16 it if you're a dentist prescribed
32:18 fluoride it'll blow up everybody's teeth
32:20 and you'll stay in business it's
32:21 interesting the formal education well a
32:27 lot of us don't want to be attorneys
32:29 because we want to go to heaven a lot of
32:32 us don't want to be doctors because we
32:34 don't want to lose 10 years of our life
32:35 in in an educational institution and
32:38 then another 10 years in some residency
32:42 and so we want to get life going a lot
32:45 faster that was my problem personally I
32:48 wanted to live life but I wanted to do
32:52 all kinds of stuff that normally you
32:54 would need a formal education first
32:57 music studio I went to in my life in
33:00 California the dude had his master's
33:03 degree in music he had theory and a
33:05 bunch of other stuff and I learned a
33:06 little bit from this guy but not much I
33:08 wasn't there to learn anything from but
33:11 I was just a natural at writing music
33:13 and he would walk in and get just
33:16 deathly jealous of what I was creating
33:19 and I hate saying that because that's
33:20 it's an easy thing to cop to kind of
33:22 give yourself a little passive alkylate
33:24 but here's what this guy would do I
33:26 would be live just just playing my one
33:30 of my songs or layering one of them up
33:32 and he walk up to the mixing board which
33:34 is way away from where I was sitting and
33:36 he'd start putting on echo facts and all
33:39 this kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] up all my
33:40 cadence writing and playing this ballad
33:42 and he's making a chirp all over the you
33:44 know one notes playing eight times and
33:46 descending into the distance he needed
33:49 to sabotage well I'd already dealt with
33:52 that as a child because I
33:55 a parent that was doing that to me as
33:56 well I was just kind I was cool with it
33:59 I was like man what an ass one it's his
34:00 place I can't [ __ ] complain right but
34:03 everything I wanted to do I had to teach
34:05 myself and here's the weird thing I went
34:08 out weird thing but here's the
34:09 interesting thing that got me going and
34:10 you probably have one of these as well I
34:12 was an artist that are really young age
34:14 like I've said so I learned as a really
34:18 not as a really young person well I can
34:21 learn how to do artwork and as much as
34:23 my teacher would say this is how you do
34:26 perspective there's these are four or
34:27 five different ways you can shade he
34:30 really didn't he really couldn't teach
34:32 me how to draw but he couldn't insert
34:34 himself in my body and say I'm gonna
34:35 show you how to draw this and then you
34:37 feel that you feel those motor mechanics
34:39 okay now I'm gonna pop out of your soul
34:40 and you can have control again of your
34:42 body or whatever and now you know how to
34:44 draw it it doesn't work like that you
34:46 have to practice your ass off so when I
34:49 got into computers same thing back in
34:51 the old day and I really regret kids
34:54 trying to learn today because it's just
34:55 so [ __ ] convoluted every programming
34:57 language out there is so goddamn
34:59 convoluted it's ridiculous especially
35:01 the ones that run on our desktops
35:03 whether it be Windows or Mac I mean they
35:06 have got commands - they got gooeys and
35:09 all this their stuff is supposed to help
35:10 you but man if they just made a good
35:12 language which is like so [ __ ] easy
35:15 we've had them in the past you could
35:18 learn how to code in minutes minutes
35:21 again back in the day you bought a
35:24 computer and the damn thing just out of
35:25 blinking cursor when you started you had
35:28 to feed the operating system system
35:30 disks in and if then load your program
35:33 and then run it was a big long process
35:34 right and obviously more people probably
35:38 ran software than road software at some
35:41 point so we learned you could do it
35:44 yourself and then when I lived in a
35:45 small town like I've said several times
35:46 we did everything at our own house right
35:50 every guy owned a plumber's wrench right
35:53 everybody knew how to everyone mold
35:56 their own lawn you know you knew all the
35:57 processes you fixed your own car you
35:59 changed your own oil you did all that
36:01 stuff by yourself and so everything was
36:03 you need to learn how to do these things
36:05 you're a woman you're gonna have all the
36:06 women things and they're things that
36:08 love to do and all the guy things and
36:10 the women rely on the dudes to fix the
36:12 car and keep it running and the dude
36:13 relies on the girl to know how to maybe
36:15 make a meal or keep the house going
36:17 raise the kids it was just a nice thing
36:19 now it's all evil now right what a bunch
36:21 of [ __ ] that is as long as there's
36:24 mutual respect between the two partners
36:26 it's a beautiful life let me tell you
36:28 you can't handle everything by yourself
36:30 and have a life left over right any of
36:34 you are single parents you know what
36:35 it's like I was a single parent
36:36 holy hell it was like do absolutely
36:39 everything constantly so you know that
36:43 there are trade skills where you have to
36:44 learn things if you're gonna learn how
36:45 to fix cars well you could come in with
36:47 a lot of knowledge just like me with
36:49 programming and he could just be like
36:51 keeping up-to-date on everything but
36:52 what if you wanted to change from
36:53 American brand car to an exotic brand
36:56 car you want to go into Mercedes or
36:58 Ferraris well you might have a guy who's
37:00 gonna mentor you like a blacksmith
37:02 that's usually the way it happens but
37:04 sometimes again you want to live a
37:06 little bit more life than is normally
37:10 possible by going into these
37:12 institutions and burning decades inside
37:14 these institutions so you get home and
37:17 you get your books yeah whatever you
37:18 want online today it's so awesome my god
37:22 it's awesome you want to learn how to do
37:24 something you just look up the problem
37:26 and you solve it just like Vanilla Ice
37:27 Baby I had one of my episodes I had the
37:32 mic on too hot and I got home and I
37:34 started listening to it as a recording I
37:36 was like oh my god I got the mic up too
37:37 hot I'm burning out my voice horribly so
37:41 I have Adobe Audition I looked up Adobe
37:43 Audition
37:45 clipping how to clip how to get rid of
37:47 distortion this dude in three minutes
37:50 broke it down beautifully I fixed the
37:53 track and it's gonna sound just fine you
37:56 won't know which one it is
37:58 like I said anything that you want to
38:00 learn how to do you put it in Google or
38:02 C you put it in and when you put in
38:03 Google but in YouTube boom there's like
38:05 a hundred videos teaching you how to do
38:07 that thing so that's pretty luring right
38:09 so let's look at your age because your
38:13 age is everything
38:15 unfortunately my show is too mature for
38:17 kids but if you have access to kids you
38:21 might stay
38:22 this information from all my episodes
38:23 about how to get a job being an artist
38:26 anything creative just going through the
38:28 creative playlist and get yourself
38:30 updated on some of that stuff I
38:32 sometimes I forget to click the creative
38:35 category that's in self-improvement your
38:39 kids need to start playing in things the
38:42 second that they gain consciousness
38:45 again my trick that I found was that if
38:48 I told my daughter I bought her a bunch
38:50 of honey a much a bunch of art supplies
38:53 have fun she would resist just one of
38:57 those kind of kids and so but if I just
39:00 left it around the house she might
39:01 wander into it and get it get it going
39:03 herself but by the age of 18 your kid
39:07 needs to have played in probably
39:09 everything that is technically possible
39:12 for them to engage in in the next four
39:15 years right during their formal
39:16 education when I was a kid it was it was
39:23 expected that you would do your two
39:24 years of junior college then declare a
39:27 major and go into a four-year and get
39:29 your major well today they want you to
39:31 declare your major from the second you
39:33 walk into college at 18 years old can
39:35 you imagine the kids today trying to
39:37 figure that out what they end up doing
39:39 is picking something that they don't
39:40 really love and then they get the degree
39:43 and then maybe they get a job and they
39:45 don't like it and then they're forced to
39:47 become a teacher or change their degree
39:50 or change what they love go back and get
39:52 a undergrad degree or excuse me um
39:55 graduate degree and change their life
39:59 but that's 2 more years that's another
40:00 loan and that's another delay to start
40:02 in your life and so they tend to
40:04 demonize everything that's life and love
40:07 everything that is what they have
40:08 available it's just natural right now
40:12 again these are for this this is really
40:13 a passage about folks that want to do
40:17 careers some people just want to start
40:19 families and there's nothing wrong with
40:20 that at all it's a beautiful thing we
40:22 need great people in this world but it
40:25 should be almost an emergency broadcast
40:27 in this country of America I can't speak
40:30 for any other country but in America it
40:32 should just literally go out as a red
40:34 hot
40:34 noticed everyone's cellphone get your
40:37 kids involved in things that can turn
40:39 into trade skills right and I'm really
40:43 sorry to tell you that playing soccer
40:44 probably ain't one of those things being
40:48 in a band you know like a band in school
40:50 may not be one of those things it may be
40:52 a great place to have some fun and blow
40:54 some steam off but think about all those
40:56 events rip families to pieces
40:58 I have watched in Southern California
40:59 since I've been down here families
41:02 running around trying to keep up with
41:03 all the games that these kids play these
41:05 sports titles and the families literally
41:07 ripped apart there's all these arguments
41:08 happening it costs a tremendous amount
41:10 of money to get the kids all this [ __ ]
41:12 to play these games and there's no
41:14 future in it you know maybe though if
41:17 you kid shows really intense aptitude
41:19 and they love it you're not forcing them
41:21 into it because you think they need to
41:22 learn team sports or whatever they could
41:24 get a scholarship and that could be a
41:26 very powerful thing for the family to
41:28 save a hundred grand right so if your
41:30 kids really good at something like that
41:31 that may be the strategy but then there
41:35 has to be a second strategy right so
41:37 your kid's gonna get I can tell you
41:39 right now I've got plenty of friends
41:40 who've got scholarships due to soccer
41:43 which is fine a pivot pays the bills and
41:45 that's good but their degrees are these
41:48 frivolous weird degrees that don't turn
41:50 out to be anything employable mmm but
41:54 now let's take a break from that line of
41:56 thinking and let's go back to my buddy
41:59 so you're totally successful at what you
42:01 do but you feel inferior to some
42:05 infinitesimal degree that it makes you
42:07 loop in a conversation saying well you
42:10 know I didn't get my degree I didn't get
42:11 my degree I didn't get my degree well
42:14 you could have a degree you could have a
42:16 degree in something that's either
42:17 expired or you're not interested in it
42:22 or it doesn't match up to a trade skill
42:25 all right when I was going through
42:28 schooling in the 1990s I actually almost
42:31 moved back to the Midwest to go through
42:32 a formal education and my my he's my
42:35 second cousin but I call him my uncle
42:36 cause he's my dad's age he has his ph.d
42:39 he ran merck pharmaceutical for 20-plus
42:43 years utter genius and I was at his
42:46 place just coincidentally
42:48 having dinner with the guy and his kids
42:49 and I hadn't seen his kids since I was
42:51 you know much younger back in the
42:52 Midwest they all moved to the to the Bay
42:55 Area
42:55 it's just crazy and he sat there and
42:58 smiled and he's just the nicest guy on
43:00 planet earth and he he said why well you
43:03 know tell me about this moving back to
43:04 Texas I'm gonna move to Texas where my
43:06 dad lived and go school I said well you
43:08 know I just think it'd be good to get a
43:11 formal education get all this on paper
43:13 and then I could get you know the lame
43:16 employers to employ me which is what
43:19 we're gonna get to in a second here and
43:21 he says why would you want to do that
43:22 and I said what do you mean I've never
43:24 had anyone in the world talked me out of
43:26 a degree let alone a guy with a PhD let
43:28 alone a guy who I'm sitting in his one
43:31 of many houses he has you know he had
43:34 bumped he bounced he was just the genius
43:36 this guy invented all kinds of wild
43:38 stuff and he was writing protocols for
43:39 abolish and Lomb just does his little
43:41 side gig
43:42 he was just retired pretty much I said
43:45 well you look at the spoils you have
43:46 because of your degree and he goes I
43:48 spent 10 years in school because I
43:51 didn't live any of my 20s when I came
43:53 out I went straight into corporate
43:54 America Pharma I was good at it but I
43:58 lost my life and then so but now I wake
43:59 up and I'm 50 years old and I'm retired
44:01 out of that and I run around trying to
44:03 chase jobs all the Willing went to Japan
44:05 for a little while and created a he
44:07 created a tape that used cocaine the act
44:11 was some element of cocaine to move your
44:13 teeth in about a month and a half but
44:16 then after three months you could get
44:17 rid of three years worth of braces you
44:19 just take the tape off and everything
44:21 hardens back up and you're great and
44:23 then the company president dies and the
44:25 son doesn't want to it doesn't have any
44:27 interest in the tape and so he throws a
44:29 whole [ __ ] thing away I mean what a
44:30 [ __ ] idiot so it ends up that night
44:33 he changes my mind the move is off and I
44:37 mean I had told everyone I was moving my
44:39 family my close friends I called it off
44:42 because that one conversation because he
44:44 goes you already do what you love to do
44:46 why would you change your thing why
44:48 would you prove it to anyone else right
44:51 and here's the interesting thing people
44:54 with degrees stick together
44:56 the people without degrees stick
44:58 together hmm-what out we can name plenty
45:03 of people without degrees that are
45:04 pushed shopping carts and living outside
45:06 restaurant dumpsters right we're not
45:09 talking about those folks we're talking
45:10 about guys like Steve Jobs for those of
45:14 you like Windows maybe Bill Gates not a
45:16 huge Bill Gates fan but he managed to
45:19 succeed without a degree and there's a
45:21 ton of them a ton of people that you
45:24 admire that have no formal education hmm
45:28 now I don't mean to create a beacon for
45:30 you outside a formal education if you
45:32 know there's a degree out there with
45:35 your name on it
45:35 there's a profession you want to do you
45:38 want to get into electronics er or
45:40 robotics or something and again there's
45:43 a mathematical formula but let me finish
45:46 up this point and we'll get back to that
45:48 would you really want to work for a
45:51 company that is so ill-informed meaning
45:53 people that are so ill informed they
45:56 can't look at your experience and your
45:59 knowledge and figure out that you're the
46:02 perfect person for the job would you
46:04 really want to work for a person like
46:05 that I mean you're coming in and they're
46:08 a big doubting Tom hmm I'm gonna tell
46:12 you don't want to work for those people
46:13 because in a way they're kind of idiots
46:16 I work for [ __ ] idiots how far up can
46:19 you go in a company or they believe in a
46:21 philosophy that makes no goddamn sense
46:24 again if it's a really intense work or
46:27 really intense trade excuse me that you
46:30 have to have a degree in of course you
46:32 have to have the degree in it again this
46:34 will fold it to our next point if you
46:38 wanted to get a bunch of information
46:39 SuperDuper quick quick so you can live
46:43 life to the max you want to be a baller
46:46 in your own definition of being a baller
46:48 well if you have a good school and you
46:52 have a good track that you're on you
46:54 have a trade skill that you want to go
46:56 for and you're gonna have to you can
46:58 essentially sit around and try to teach
47:00 yourself something but you might have a
47:01 couple different blind spots where you
47:03 don't know and these other kids who went
47:05 to formal education they don't have any
47:06 of those blind spots
47:07 could you imagine trying to well let's
47:11 take it this way I'll give you an
47:12 analogy you can figure out for yourself
47:13 let's say there's something that you've
47:15 taught yourself and you're extremely
47:17 knowledgeable about that thing and you
47:19 can have any level of conversation in
47:20 that particular category but now I come
47:23 in your brain and I take two giant
47:25 chunks of it maybe 30% of your knowledge
47:28 of that I just subtracted and now you're
47:31 no longer as comfortable as you were
47:33 having those conversations because
47:34 you're like well I don't know quite how
47:36 that works and but I know that's real
47:37 important to what I do well college can
47:41 if it's a good school make sure there
47:44 are very few blind spots in your mind so
47:48 part of formal education could get you
47:50 the information as quickly as possible
47:51 because you're gonna go balls to the
47:53 wall
47:53 right and you can go faster than your
47:56 education dictates if you're really good
47:58 and if you're really interested sadly
48:00 out of a four-year degree you're getting
48:02 a bunch of sort of what they call your
48:03 AAA stuff your basic stuff that although
48:06 valuable and will round you off as a
48:09 human being again psychology and
48:11 sociology they're they can be boring
48:14 classes or they can be extremely
48:15 exciting classes second time I took it I
48:18 loved it to death but even the first
48:19 time I took it it was pretty cool I
48:21 think you're gonna want to get it all
48:23 and as much as you possibly can and
48:26 you're gonna get to step on the
48:29 shoulders of giants because these
48:30 educators sometimes have been in the
48:32 real world and then consist through what
48:34 you need to know what you don't need to
48:36 know now if you're in a bad school
48:39 that's a problem I would suggest that if
48:42 you have no other option but a bad
48:44 school it's probably less than a 50%
48:48 chance that that school is gonna be any
48:50 value of you but they're gonna still
48:51 charge you for the service so you may
48:54 hold often so you can get to a better
48:56 school or you go in and get what you can
48:58 that's good and you leave as soon as
49:00 that's over one of my friends went into
49:05 nursing and she went to school for it
49:08 and they wanted to take a computer class
49:13 and it wasn't just one computer class it
49:16 was like two or three different computer
49:18 classes she's studying to be a nurse not
49:20 to be a computer
49:21 for engineer or harbor engineer she
49:25 called me up once in a panic because she
49:27 was having a problem understanding a
49:28 bunch of the material and so I get in
49:32 there having spent my entire life and
49:34 computers at all levels and I will tell
49:37 you that the class that they had her
49:38 taking was the most ridiculous [ __ ]
49:41 class I've ever heard in my life they
49:44 were trying to get her to understand
49:46 specifications of USB drives of RAM
49:50 sticks almost down to the point of like
49:53 pulling out an Ethernet cable and
49:55 looking down the pins and being able to
49:57 tell you what's part it's the
49:58 transmission pin and the receiving pin
50:00 and the power pin and all that stuff
50:02 unbelievably ridiculous curriculum for
50:05 this nursing school I mean it would be
50:09 it would be like a big eye for class or
50:11 something ridiculous you get a triage a
50:13 computer while you're triage and human
50:14 beings hey I don't know about you but
50:16 I'd rather have a nurse that knows how
50:18 to fix me and knows Jack all about
50:20 computers right you know everyone knows
50:23 how to run software right everyone knows
50:24 how to write a letter to mommy and all
50:26 that kind of stuff but I want someone's
50:28 gonna save my life so you get bad
50:31 schools now some people are just
50:34 geniuses right they just are you run
50:37 into him every once in a while I my step
50:42 father wrote a book he's got a PhD he
50:45 wrote a book on Kenneth Burke III debate
50:49 going back into my Kenneth Burke
50:50 research and doing a whole episode on
50:53 this guy because he was a very brilliant
50:55 dude I can't remember exactly what years
50:58 this occurred but it was early 20th
51:01 century and he was one of these guys
51:03 that said hey den instead of giving me
51:06 instead of paying for my college and
51:08 giving all the money to a university why
51:11 don't you give me all the money that
51:12 you've saved for my university training
51:14 and I will formally teach myself and he
51:18 did it and he became a very noted
51:22 philosopher in this world he's a big
51:27 pioneer of scapegoating theory among
51:29 other things
51:30 but what this guy did was lay out his
51:33 curriculum as hardcore as a four-year
51:36 university read the books I don't know
51:39 if the guy ever tested out he probably
51:41 should have tested out after he's done
51:42 but the certifications to practice so I
51:44 think must have been a little bit
51:45 lighter back in his days but that always
51:48 appealed to me because I heard about him
51:49 probably in the mid 90s after I was you
51:52 know how they successful and what I
51:53 wanted to do know what could you do with
51:57 informal education teaching yourself now
52:01 I've got episodes on all this stuff back
52:02 in season one and I don't redo them
52:04 because I've already done them I wanted
52:07 to get into music badly and it was a
52:11 personal endeavor for me I never really
52:13 contemplated doing it professionally I
52:16 mean I would I would have my little
52:18 fantasies again but like I said once I
52:20 started seeing the lifestyles of people
52:21 in the music business I was like I don't
52:23 think I want to get into doing pounds of
52:25 coke and/or heroin and you know living
52:29 on a bus my entire life I still have
52:32 that little fantasy of like let me just
52:34 make a really cool album of music with
52:36 our sing or not doesn't matter just make
52:38 a really cool album music that might
52:40 sell might be like club music or
52:42 something although I'm highly
52:44 incompatible with kids these days for
52:45 club music it just put one truck out
52:48 there you know it's like that track what
52:50 is love yeah that guy was pretty old
52:54 when he put that track out what was the
52:55 other guy the guy made that song a lot a
52:57 lot of one-hit wonder some people in
52:58 their 30s 40s and 50s that gotti did I'm
53:03 too sexy you know the kind of tracks not
53:05 my kind of music but you just smile and
53:08 you go man that dude just made a [ __ ]
53:09 ton of money right at the right time any
53:11 little nest egg for himself but what I
53:15 ended up doing with my money from my
53:17 formal business which was software
53:20 engineering as I started accumulating
53:21 instruments I started practicing my ass
53:25 off I mean I would play my drums
53:26 for you know three hours Street every
53:29 night after work and just sit there and
53:31 just pour sweat down my body practice my
53:35 guitar over and over and over and I you
53:38 know I got good enough to be dangerous I
53:40 think but in it what ended up happening
53:43 was I started making
53:44 my uncle albums of music right it's sort
53:47 of all embarrassing at this point
53:49 because the you since for everything and
53:51 those those sounds have all kind of
53:53 expired in everyone's brains but there
53:56 is a point when I was working Electronic
53:58 Arts and I was still a contractor at the
54:01 time and there was a golden point where
54:06 this person had screwed up a bunch of
54:08 music for knockout Kings the very first
54:10 one in 1998 and a lot of guys in the
54:14 department were listening to my music in
54:16 their cubes they just loved it because I
54:18 was really getting a lot of club music
54:19 and just taking my classical
54:21 self-training with Bach and CPE Bach and
54:25 and a few others and just mixing them
54:28 all together into these crazy
54:30 compilations I did a big version of John
54:35 Carpenter's Halloween as well into a big
54:38 techno song so anyway I got a lot of
54:40 attention from that and we would cruise
54:42 home at night from clubs listening to my
54:45 stuff in the car and I was like wow this
54:46 is really weird my friends want to
54:48 listen to my [ __ ] in the cars it's like
54:49 it was a [ __ ] trip and then when I
54:53 started singing and playing the guitar
54:55 like at acoustic guitar and singing some
54:57 sort of bluesy you know I don't know
54:59 cowboy music or whatever it was I had a
55:02 whole set of other friends that loved
55:03 that stuff but anyway this kid screwed
55:06 it up he screwed up his studio more than
55:07 anything I never even heard his music
55:09 but they came to me and said look you
55:11 need to do this music we only got 2,000
55:16 bucks and I was like alright I'll do it
55:19 and so I took the 2 grand
55:21 I bought a JP 8000 synthesizer because I
55:24 owned everything else but I need ISM
55:26 sounds off this this keyboard to do what
55:28 they were looking for sure enough it was
55:30 great I used my all my other stuff to
55:32 create horns and started playing the
55:34 drums and started playing my Fender
55:36 guitar and doing a bunch of stuff and I
55:38 ended up creating my first video game
55:40 music it was cool but it wasn't a
55:44 miracle overnight right I had bought my
55:46 first guitar probably 1988 or something
55:49 like that and it's just sad to listening
55:52 to prints and Stevie Ray Vaughn and and
55:56 Jimmy Hendrix and just listen just
55:58 playing for hours and hours and hours
56:00 just horrible
56:01 follow along you know attempts to figure
56:03 out how to play the guitar and it was
56:04 all it was without any formal drinks I
56:07 had no idea what notes I was playing I
56:09 no idea what key I was in yeah I bought
56:11 some books and you know I'd learned like
56:13 a part of the riff but I still had no
56:14 idea what the [ __ ] I was playing but I
56:16 could play I could play I could play on
56:19 a piano by the time I was probably 1989
56:22 or so two or three years into the piano
56:24 I could play infinitely and just people
56:26 just sit and listen I used to play for
56:27 my grandmother she used to have big
56:29 piano in the house I guess I could
56:31 pretty much do that around 86 87 but I
56:33 just learned theory in my head voice
56:35 leading and and you know repetition is
56:38 makes a song right big four notes play
56:40 four times in a row switch up and give
56:43 yourself a B to your a and it worked so
56:46 a lot of you have that capability built
56:49 inside you but a lot of you have that
56:51 capability and you haven't even tried I
56:54 want to make sure that all of you take
56:56 inventory of yourself right now in your
56:58 life and it doesn't matter how old you
57:00 are because half of this stuff
57:01 especially in those creative realms is
57:04 entertainment for you and like Steve
57:07 Jobs taught all tall all of us if you
57:09 make a product that makes you happy
57:11 whatever it is a piece of entertainment
57:14 you make some invention that helps you
57:16 clean the kitchen counter a little bit
57:18 better there's a bunch of people that
57:20 dig it and will pay you for it right
57:22 what also ends up happening and I know
57:25 that all of you have probably
57:26 experiences and if you haven't got a
57:28 little present out there you need to
57:30 give yourself once you get into this
57:32 stuff and start succeeding because
57:34 you'll succeed at different levels and
57:36 I've said some of this three years ago I
57:38 want to say it again but once you start
57:41 seeing yourself succeed that's gonna do
57:44 a lot for your whole life because you're
57:47 gonna realize you've got recessive genes
57:50 you have a certain wiring in your brain
57:52 that whatever you want to do you you may
57:56 have thought about it so much it's like
57:57 the basketball players that were taught
57:59 that they visualize making all the free
58:01 throws they do a lot better and doing
58:03 their free throws there's boxers out
58:04 there that envision themselves winning
58:06 and they just when when when
58:07 it's amazing right if you have Don King
58:10 as a manager you won all the time but it
58:13 increases your self-confidence and it
58:16 also opens up a bunch of other doors but
58:19 let me give you a little lesson from
58:22 your humble narrator one of the things
58:24 you don't want to do is celebrate too
58:27 hard with a tiny success get excited and
58:31 save that energy up don't run around
58:33 telling everybody you did it don't run
58:35 around giving yourself Pat's on the back
58:37 too much because you'll take the steam
58:39 out of the experience and you won't go
58:42 any further when I became an artist I
58:46 guess or realized I was an artist at one
58:48 point you know I was always an
58:50 entrepreneur so I was kidding walking
58:52 door-to-door selling my art as a seven
58:54 year old it was kind of funny but when I
58:58 started you know oil painting I just
59:00 pick a really hard thing I picked Purple
59:02 Rain the cover and I'd never / I never
59:05 painted anything I actually paint a lot
59:07 kisum's when I was nine years old but
59:09 when I finally got to my teens I just
59:12 said I'm gonna do this I've never done
59:14 it before mine I'm gonna do this and I
59:15 just started painting and painting and
59:17 I'm not painting over him several times
59:18 but I got him and that album cover
59:20 really well and then I moved around a
59:22 little bit and didn't get to finish the
59:23 whole outside but I didn't give a [ __ ]
59:24 because princely good in the middle and
59:26 that was the guy I was going to that's
59:30 the only one I really cared about right
59:31 but I started selling paintings it in
59:33 high school guy said bring me pictures
59:35 of Marilyn Monroe lips with cherries in
59:38 it and you know with all kinds of weird
59:40 [ __ ] falling out of their mouths so I
59:41 used to paint that and just sell the
59:42 painting just one after the other
59:44 in fact I moved out of my dad's house at
59:46 16 and I ended up having this Marilyn
59:49 Monroe painting it was done and the guy
59:51 was like Jesus I need to get my painting
59:53 I'm like yeah it's over at my grandma's
59:54 come on over and I completely forgot
59:57 that but I moved to California you know
60:00 it was again very successful at my own
60:02 two bedroom apartment and I was like 18
60:04 years old but I still always wanted a
60:06 little bit more money and I remember
60:08 there was a woman at work that for
60:10 whatever reason just had amazing faith
60:12 in me and she just goes well I need you
60:16 to do a painting for me and she brought
60:17 me some samples of her of her
60:19 I'm betting and she goes if you could
60:22 just take these colors and do something
60:23 with it with the patterns and stuff so I
60:25 created one of those three different
60:26 painting things it's probably 88 89 and
60:30 I created her a little thing [ __ ] on
60:32 the wall she hang it in certain places
60:33 and it all went together beautifully and
60:35 then she somehow figured out I had this
60:37 other giant painting I was doing of the
60:41 world was a very surrealistic picture
60:42 two eyes looking down on the world and
60:44 it was all about our technology you know
60:46 might be the end of us sort of painting
60:48 it was huge 30 by 40 and she bought it
60:51 and then when there her and her husband
60:53 got a divorce they were fighting over
60:55 this painting it was just funny arranged
60:57 Jamie do a portrait of her family which
60:59 I did it but I really wished I could
61:02 redo it now now in the mid 90s as well
61:05 it's gonna give you some examples
61:07 because I need you to understand how
61:09 successful you can be in an informal way
61:12 I'm not telling this to make you think
61:14 I'm cool or anything like that I mean
61:16 you literally I don't know how blown
61:19 away anyone would be seeing my old stuff
61:21 or listening to the old stuff but I got
61:23 this reputation Friday music and one of
61:25 my friends goes hey my sister is getting
61:27 married to this dude and they are having
61:29 a wedding and they want wedding music to
61:35 go with the slide show they got a bunch
61:37 of fast stuff and then they have a bunch
61:38 of like heart-wrenching stuff and so I
61:40 wrote two pieces and I remember showing
61:42 up at this wedding and I just brought my
61:45 tracks with me I can't remember how I
61:47 was playing them and ended up being the
61:51 track and everybody cried and everybody
61:52 yelled and screamed they had a good time
61:54 and it was a meet I got a lot of people
61:56 come up to me like well you did that
61:57 music I was like yeah yeah he got a
61:59 couple keyboards at home and I'm just
62:01 sequencing within the keyboards it was
62:02 really fun that led to my first studio
62:07 but sorry I didn't finish my points so
62:10 when I got really good at painting and
62:12 drawing and all this kind of stuff and
62:13 it was just easy to blow people's minds
62:15 this paint boom paint boom everyone was
62:17 like wow I just sit down into a painting
62:19 of prints you know and then I've done so
62:21 many him it's crazy I've sold a bunch of
62:23 them I just have a I think two left now
62:26 I sort of got bored with it
62:32 and it was like nothing was challenging
62:35 but the problem was I hadn't studied
62:37 art well enough - my mother was trying
62:40 she was really trying to get me to
62:42 understand surrealism and cubism and
62:45 Impressionism and all that kind of stuff
62:47 and I just was like an that looks like
62:49 [ __ ] you know you look good you know
62:51 because it was all impressionist it what
62:53 an idiot I was right
62:54 I never discovered Salvador Dali before
62:59 I quit you know I can still paint I
63:01 still create all kinds of paint projects
63:03 I create physical projects now where I
63:05 build something and I paint in I give it
63:07 to somebody and they just literally have
63:09 a one of a kind I have [ __ ] all over the
63:10 place man that people don't know I
63:11 painted I paint restaurant walls you
63:14 know like I found my buddy's restaurant
63:16 as big rock and roll crepe restaurant
63:19 and he had one wall that was all black
63:21 with a barbed wire fence on it and
63:22 people walk in and look around they got
63:24 the family in the car and they want to
63:26 eat the food looks the menu looks great
63:28 and they just look inside and they walk
63:30 off and then remember the founder goes
63:32 god I [ __ ] hate that I said well dude
63:36 it's not exactly looks like a family
63:37 Russian I said let me do this man I got
63:39 a game company right now my skills are
63:41 really hot I've never painted that
63:43 particular thing but I know I can get
63:45 this done and sure enough he didn't want
63:47 to do it until I took a picture of his
63:48 restaurant took it home masked out the
63:52 wall and then put the artwork in that I
63:54 wanted in his restaurant and then did
63:56 all the shading so it looked absolutely
63:57 photo-real and then I texted it two of
64:00 them and literally his wife and came
64:02 back in two minutes and goes we're gonna
64:04 do it do it I don't care what he says
64:06 this looks fantastic to this day it's
64:09 got my two Flying V guitars on the wall
64:11 and everyone who comes in there sits
64:13 underneath the guitars cuz that's the
64:15 that's the guitars right so you can do
64:19 this kind of stuff you don't need
64:20 permission from anybody right I don't
64:24 want to hear people sort of Debby
64:28 downing themselves because they don't
64:29 have formal education because they think
64:32 they've passed their 20s one they don't
64:34 think they have any time to go back to
64:36 school and they they quite frankly may
64:37 not have the time if any one thing is if
64:42 you want a ball right what you means you
64:43 want to have money you want to control
64:45 your destiny
64:46 you are going to have to get organized
64:49 in your life I have a whole episode on
64:51 time management episode 1 it's not what
64:54 you think okay it's not like game this
64:56 is how you manage time in a project uh
64:57 it's about crafting your life such that
65:01 every single spare seconds you have goes
65:04 towards your love goes towards what you
65:06 like you know some people sit in the
65:08 bathroom for a long time all right well
65:10 you know what I wrote at least two songs
65:12 with a little synthesizer on my lap
65:15 trying to figure out who number two
65:17 works for you know I drew my high-school
65:20 book cover on the toilet okay which for
65:24 my 30 if I am put it back in the
65:27 computer and finally finished it the way
65:28 they said it was going to be printed
65:30 there's a whole group out there a whole
65:33 society out there called the make group
65:36 and they do everything old ladies making
65:40 quilts two guys building robots two
65:43 people doing absolutely everything
65:45 making kites anything that exists in the
65:47 world it's in the make organization go
65:50 look it up and even if you don't join
65:53 the organization I don't know if you
65:54 join it with money anything I haven't
65:55 paid any money for it but recently I got
65:58 back into electronics because of my
66:01 project with LED virtual reality's
66:03 theaters I wanted to understand more the
66:05 subatomic sub the controller boards and
66:07 all this other stuff you know what I
66:09 figured out it's all easy and that's the
66:13 other thing you have to understand once
66:14 you understand an art of some sort be it
66:17 surgery be it psychology or engineering
66:22 artwork anything eventually you get to
66:25 this beautiful sweet spot where it's
66:28 easy when I teach students software what
66:33 I well the way I do it is I don't really
66:35 go through no this is how you do this
66:37 right I just had a friend of mine she
66:38 was struggling the Photoshop yesterday
66:40 and I I just I hate cropping this crap
66:43 out I told her three tricks and she was
66:47 flying she was like oh my god I can't
66:49 believe much time I'm saving Lake City
66:50 mm-hmm a little bit of passing of the
66:52 torch and people live a better life
66:55 right for you people trying to learn
66:58 software
66:59 there's an interesting trick then it
67:01 actually applies to life as well but
67:02 then numbers might be a little bit
67:04 skewed and software's very interesting
67:06 let's say you were to launch Photoshop
67:08 for the very first time
67:09 well that that product is horribly
67:12 unintuitive it is just like AutoCAD
67:15 AutoCAD is even worse in AutoCAD it's
67:17 ten times worse than Photoshop they're
67:20 being intuitive it's because programmers
67:24 aren't right burning their left brain so
67:26 they do things really systematic it's
67:30 getting better but what happens with
67:33 Photoshop what I tell my students is I
67:36 say look every product like this Maya
67:38 blender 3d all these products you will
67:41 be mastered by it for a number of years
67:44 and then you will start to become its
67:45 master you will start to understand that
67:48 there are hundreds and hundreds of
67:50 filters and tools and layers and masks
67:52 and all kinds of cool things you can do
67:54 and once you understand how each one of
67:56 these things works individually you can
67:58 start putting them on top of each other
67:59 and creating things that no one's ever
68:01 seen before and it starts to get you
68:03 money it starts to get you jobs and
68:07 security and so if you want to enjoy
68:11 your weekends doing something different
68:13 why not do something during the week
68:15 that you love I've talked a lot about
68:17 that thing of feeling lost in your job I
68:20 have an episode directly on it but I
68:22 mentioned it several times in different
68:23 episodes it's probably nothing more
68:28 acidic to your stomach than to feel like
68:31 you're in a in a bad loop a bad cycle
68:34 but a little trick in life goes
68:36 something like this let's say you're in
68:39 a bad loop you don't like your job very
68:41 much you don't know what you're gonna do
68:44 with your life you don't like the one
68:45 that you're in you don't mind everything
68:47 about your let me don't hate everything
68:49 you might like your house about your
68:50 neighborhood but you like geez I don't
68:52 like where I go to work every day I
68:55 might have kids a lot of demanding
68:58 things on your life well just a little
69:01 snippet of the time management thing is
69:04 that one of the greatest things in the
69:06 world is a light at the end of the
69:10 tunnel some people might call it hope I
69:12 think hope is sort of
69:13 fantasy emotion that is basically a lie
69:17 but you can get this feeling of like you
69:20 know what I'm gonna go to that crappy
69:23 job as soon as I get home I'm going to
69:26 my my new job and it's you studying
69:29 things there's always a Saturday and a
69:31 Sunday and usually in America you have
69:33 to do two days off every five days on
69:35 all right at the end of every day
69:38 there's usually time depending on when
69:40 you start there might be time depending
69:42 how long your lunches there's time your
69:45 the bathroom there's time there's books
69:47 there's videos there's just trial
69:50 software half the time and you want to
69:52 download it if you want to learn an
69:53 instrument
69:54 well you need to go get yourself one and
69:56 don't worry about getting the very best
69:57 of everything man I learned how to play
70:00 the guitar on a I think a three hundred
70:03 dollar acoustic I still own it it's been
70:07 with me forever first time I ever wrote
70:09 a song when I was lying on my back and
70:11 in bed and until this summer was dark I
70:14 couldn't see anything but I was just
70:15 sitting there playing I found a couple
70:17 chords I have no idea what know what I'm
70:18 playing I don't know what key I'm in and
70:20 I just started singing lyrics and had
70:22 turned into a song which led to a bunch
70:24 of other songs so again you don't have
70:28 to have all that formal knowledge to
70:30 kick ass and take names right we are
70:33 human beings because we're human beings
70:36 we have a guarantee with the dominant
70:39 species on this planet guys you think we
70:42 got here because we don't have gifts
70:44 lying in the belly of every single one
70:46 of us if you believe in a soul and the
70:49 stream of consciousness that is the
70:50 universe and all the knowledge of the
70:52 universe then perhaps the only thing you
70:54 haven't done is run that little search
70:56 algorithm in your heart and go well geez
70:59 I really want to do this I mean I really
71:01 want to do this if I have the passion
71:03 for this once you have the passion you
71:05 ever heard that phrase where there's a
71:07 will there's a way
71:08 there you go that is the kernel that is
71:11 built into every human being why do we
71:13 like freedom because it's a passion of
71:16 ours
71:16 what's freedom give you the opportunity
71:19 to go get your dreams if you're a left
71:23 brain person you're like well geez I
71:24 kind of have that feeling but it's
71:25 really a fleeting feeling but I deaf
71:27 like don't like my job you need to flip
71:30 the script in your brain and realize
71:31 those things that you admire those
71:34 things that you use to entertain
71:35 yourself maybe you're the one that
71:37 should be on stage every once in a while
71:40 and that doesn't mean entertainment
71:43 specifically a lot of people do go back
71:46 to school and they get degrees and
71:47 things and they do amazing things with
71:50 their life I think those are very few
71:51 people that have the time and the
71:53 resources to do such a thing
71:54 or they have the energy past 40 to go
71:57 and get homework right I tell my
72:01 students I think I mentioned this in one
72:03 episode but I want to mention it to you
72:04 guys now now I'm gonna go to
72:08 universities and I have a fair amount of
72:09 time to lecture 2 or 3 hours plus I
72:13 especially throw this in but I'm even
72:15 starting to throw it in the
72:16 hour-and-a-half sessions I do every once
72:17 in a while but I remind them I say look
72:21 you are here on this planet because your
72:24 family survived all previous history of
72:27 this planet once our species was either
72:30 dropped off invented by God or both we
72:35 dominated we dominated the point we have
72:38 articulated language we control the
72:40 whole planet between Christ we control
72:42 the weather now right all right that
72:45 means that you're amazing there haven't
72:48 been enough generations of social
72:50 justice warriors to completely weed out
72:52 the amazing genetics that are in these
72:53 kids for all those kids that are
72:56 completely lost completely misguided
72:57 worshipping their demise all of them
73:00 have the gifts to take that all over and
73:02 fall in love with the good day's work
73:04 getting a trade skill well if you're not
73:08 deluded like they are well then you're
73:11 already on top you're just inches away
73:14 from whatever destiny you want if you
73:18 can get formal education that's great
73:19 but you shouldn't feel bad if you don't
73:21 have it a lot of us don't have it a lot
73:24 of the heroes that you worship never had
73:26 it now Steve Jobs eventually got a
73:30 degree and I think his 50s
73:33 unless we did his famous speech he was
73:36 the late 40s early 50s he did his famous
73:38 speech in Stanford but I tell you what
73:40 that famous speech
73:41 is posted every once in a while on
73:43 social media right and they say look you
73:45 listen to the speech by Steve Jobs and
73:47 here's what I'm going to tell you about
73:49 that speech that everybody misses
73:51 everybody misses this element of the
73:54 speech all of the brilliance in that
73:56 speech came from real life the school of
74:01 hard knocks not from Stanford he already
74:04 had all that knowledge he could have
74:05 made that speech 20 years before he did
74:08 it wasn't the formal education that gave
74:10 it to him the other thing about formal
74:13 education that you have to be weary of
74:15 and this is for those of you with
74:17 children grandchildren access to kids
74:21 that you care about what would be and
74:24 again there's different colleges okay so
74:25 I'm gonna make a distinction here but
74:27 I'm also gonna tell you my friend said
74:28 me told me about his education if you're
74:32 told everything that you need to do
74:35 constantly read this book memorize a
74:38 bunch of crap come back give the test
74:39 generally try to understand it for the
74:41 rest of your life and of course some of
74:42 that's going to be involuntary you just
74:44 can't forget it it's gonna be valuable
74:45 knowledge of course you may not be
74:51 stimulating the part of you that will
74:53 give you ultimate satisfaction at the
74:55 end of your life by the end of your life
74:58 I should say it institutionalizes left
75:01 brain learning and does very very little
75:03 for the right brain depending on what
75:05 school you go to and what course you're
75:07 taking now again if you go to a film
75:10 school or an art school they may force
75:14 you to write a screenplay direct
75:16 something see your mistakes correct it
75:18 get creative with it you may do a great
75:20 job technically executing your first
75:22 short film but the teacher gives you a D
75:24 because it wasn't very creative it
75:26 wasn't entertaining like Jesus man I did
75:29 everything when I go to psychology class
75:31 that just has read the book take the
75:32 test
75:32 I get an A here I'm doing everything I'm
75:35 told to do but I'm not getting the a and
75:37 I don't really feel that good about
75:38 anyway maybe you are feeling good about
75:40 finishing something difficult and that's
75:41 good to my good friend said Mead went to
75:46 arts center and what was interesting
75:49 about it was
75:51 I had known him for probably at least 15
75:54 years before you told me this and he
75:56 said you know Art Center didn't teach me
75:58 how to draw I already knew how to draw
76:00 and of course I already knew this I'd
76:02 already seen all of his childhood
76:04 renderings and his teenage renderings
76:06 before he got to Art Center he said what
76:10 Art Center told me had to do was to turn
76:11 my art into a business and more
76:15 specifically he said that the biggest
76:17 lesson he learned from Art Center was
76:19 the following and this is something you
76:21 need to do with whatever career you're
76:23 doing that is especially creative where
76:26 you're having to create something new
76:27 every week
76:27 maybe every day maybe every month
76:29 depending on your cycle of whatever it
76:30 takes you to do something but what he
76:32 said was they will teach you that when
76:35 you start on Monday you are executing
76:39 what you planned the previous week and
76:41 so what you're thinking about while
76:43 you're executing today's Monday through
76:45 Friday event because he was had a week
76:47 cycle in the college was you were
76:49 thinking about what you were going to do
76:50 the next week so you're not really
76:53 focused on the execution execution is
76:55 just robotic I am painting I am painting
76:56 I am painting I remember what I had
76:59 designed the previous week that applies
77:02 to a lot of things in life think about
77:04 all these musicians the tour that one
77:06 album they've got what do you think
77:08 they're really thinking about well the
77:11 second there well you can think about
77:12 all kinds of stuff while you're singing
77:14 a song it's amazing you're singing a
77:16 lyric passionately
77:17 and you're thinking you know did I leave
77:19 the oven on at home you can do those
77:20 kind of things what they're thinking of
77:23 if they're going to exist in this
77:25 industry of music or whatever they're
77:27 doing is the next album of music they
77:30 need to write because that's the demand
77:32 of the industry on you which brings up
77:36 another distinction you need to
77:37 understand when I got into the video
77:41 game business as a very young person I
77:43 saw a phenomenon that I now call the
77:46 comic book artist phenomenon it's just
77:49 my personal take on this because I saw
77:51 this several times in the comic book
77:53 industry I was never in the comic book
77:55 industry had several guys around me that
77:57 were in it that were trying to get into
77:58 it and there was this little distinction
78:01 I've said this once before an episode in
78:03 season
78:05 they could draw amazing stuff problem
78:10 they couldn't draw it fast enough why
78:13 because a lot of these guys would do
78:16 mimic art art so they would look at
78:19 another comic book and draw it
78:21 they were mimicking someone else's moves
78:23 now that's important too to learn
78:24 techniques and learn how people do
78:26 things but the guys that rise to the top
78:29 and the girls that rise to the top and
78:30 these industries of art are people that
78:32 can think for themselves it was a huge
78:36 thing that starts to happen when you can
78:37 think for yourself what I learned by
78:40 watching two friends one totally succeed
78:43 and he created his own comic book series
78:45 which turned into a bunch of other stuff
78:46 and he's worked professionally in comic
78:48 books and video games forever is that
78:51 you have to create a page a day of comic
78:55 book art you know it goes in three
78:57 layers now right as the there's the
78:59 pencil the ink and the coloring it's all
79:01 done digital digitally now for a lot of
79:03 folks but these kids that were just sort
79:06 of mimicking what they loved lacked the
79:10 proficiency to do it professionally well
79:13 every you know what is it a goal without
79:15 a deadlines a dream that's what their
79:17 whole life had turned into now these
79:19 kids were young enough to get their act
79:20 together and soup up but what what would
79:23 happen to some of these kids and one of
79:25 them was a the exhibition case as a dude
79:28 I barely knew I don't think I ever
79:29 really sat in the room with the do but I
79:32 went to this might one of my buddy's
79:33 houses and this artwork was everywhere
79:35 and they said this is our buddy
79:36 and he's trying to get into this comic
79:38 book company I think it was DC at the
79:40 time I looked at the art and it was
79:43 pretty good wasn't mind-blowing because
79:45 it was everyone else's stuff copied down
79:47 and he could create his own stuff but
79:49 his proportions on the bodies were
79:50 really weird he got in and they tested
79:54 him and he could not draw remotely a
79:57 page day plus they were looking for him
80:00 to invent new ways that the body would
80:02 be positioned because you know superhero
80:03 comic books at the time this was the
80:05 late 80s you know we're very traditional
80:08 Stan Lee kind of stuff but you had a ton
80:10 of reference but the kid couldn't put in
80:12 his brain if I'm gonna draw this kind of
80:14 stuff I need to buy every single comic
80:16 book that is exactly like this
80:18 and study it and then come up my own
80:20 crazy positions of the camera and moves
80:22 maybe I gotta buy one of those little
80:23 dolls where I kind of turn it around
80:25 look at it maybe I gotta take pictures
80:27 of myself to figure out what I do get in
80:30 front of the mirror he wasn't doing that
80:33 and so ultimately I do not believe this
80:37 individual ever got into the comic-book
80:38 industry when someone hired me to do
80:42 nine tracks for knockout Kings I had to
80:46 be able to go yes sir I will get that
80:48 done when do you need it oh I had two
80:50 weeks to write nine tracks I ended up
80:53 doing eight out of the nine because they
80:54 wanted to mariachi band I said dude you
80:56 don't want me to create a synth mariachi
80:58 band I said there's a hundred of them in
80:59 town just hire everyone to stand in
81:01 front of a mic and play whatever you
81:03 want but I did get the other eight done
81:07 later when my friends broke out of
81:12 Electronic Arts included their own video
81:13 games guess what happened they came back
81:16 to me for more music except now it had
81:18 another constraint on it because they
81:20 were getting into the Game Boy Advance
81:21 right when it came out what was the
81:23 limitation of a Game Boy Advance you
81:25 couldn't play two notes at the same time
81:28 but they wanted all this elaborate music
81:30 and one of the I did music for the NFL
81:33 Madden EA Madden port I did music for a
81:36 couple other games but then I started
81:38 doing sound effects too
81:40 but I had to play drums that were
81:45 obviously playing a ton of things at the
81:47 same time Boombah Boombah Boombah
81:49 Boombah Boombah bump well I couldn't do
81:51 that so it was a but Dibby Dibby Dibby
81:54 Dibby done everything had to be one note
81:56 at a time but it had to sound like this
81:58 other stuff well when you want to
82:00 overlay that with the synth I had a
82:02 problem so I had to figure out times
82:04 literally in the signature of my music
82:06 to interlace a scent notes with a beat
82:09 so I still had a beat it was tough but
82:13 all my previous experience in
82:15 quantifying all my notes and getting
82:17 their moving notes around to make things
82:19 perfect made that possible luckily
82:21 master tracks Pro on the Mac was awesome
82:23 and then they let it go when I worked
82:26 for LL Cool J to make his boom dizzle
82:28 producer studio which he called
82:30 something different when it finally
82:31 the Sony Vaio's all that experience came
82:35 back you know we had to essentially
82:37 create a little mini Pro Tools and then
82:39 we had to create all this you know chat
82:41 room a video chat text chat we had to
82:43 create all kinds of methodology to
82:45 record it local to the harddrive
82:46 uploaded to the server we had a create a
82:49 special plugin for the headset and the
82:51 microphone so that the milliseconds
82:54 between it hitting the port coming back
82:56 to your ear was 12 milliseconds or less
83:00 all those things made it possible for me
83:03 to deliver the first prototype of that
83:05 from the moment I shook the dude's hand
83:07 in a four seasons in LA to the moment he
83:10 recorded and makes the song with his
83:11 producer in Buffalo New York with 45
83:16 days and the dude looked at me after he
83:18 recorded this and he just said I've been
83:20 told for 15 months that this was
83:22 impossible and you guys did it in 45
83:25 days that's how you do it you get inside
83:30 your passions you intimately understand
83:32 them you challenge yourself you know
83:35 with it one of the best analogies I can
83:37 give you is the old computer analogy I
83:39 gave you earlier I got this computer it
83:42 had a I think a quad fold-out card with
83:46 top and bottom said two different
83:48 sections on each side and you flipped it
83:50 over and had the easier commands on the
83:52 front and the harder commands on the
83:53 back and I sat there and said well I got
83:55 a design a product where I'm gonna use
83:57 every single command and I did took two
84:00 or three different programs to do it
84:02 when it came to sound they had this
84:04 whole sound library I had this fantasy
84:07 of owning my own keyboard but I was like
84:10 15 14 15 years old and you know like I
84:13 would mow forever just to pay pay for my
84:16 lawnmower you know I wrote a keyboard
84:21 inside this computer and so I actually
84:25 started trying to put the notes on the
84:27 keys that was really not a good idea but
84:29 then I got to the point I could just
84:30 enter in all the sheet music and the
84:32 rests and all that kind of stuff and I'd
84:34 hear a song back and I was like well
84:35 geez this is a horrible product I
84:37 couldn't sell this one but I learned how
84:39 to read and write music because of that
84:42 get yourself a project
84:44 test yourself remember you're a human
84:48 being and we're the most amazing thing
84:50 that we have access to on this plane is
84:52 screwed up and susceptible we are as we
84:55 are to lies because we're not built to
84:57 process them this is a good fun area
85:00 where you could just change your life
85:02 and don't be worried if you get in and
85:05 you need a little formal education maybe
85:09 your idea formal education is going on
85:11 an online course
85:12 I've got buddies of mine like I said
85:14 maybe my old co-host of MKULTRA radio he
85:19 decided he loved he was playing with
85:22 poser and Bryce 3d Bryce created canyons
85:26 poser created humans so he would export
85:28 humans put him in Bryce and render these
85:31 gorgeous worlds and ship them out and
85:35 name one of my companies after one of
85:36 his drawings I still have it to this day
85:39 but he wouldn't often took a weekend
85:42 course on how to do 3d in a product
85:45 called light wave well 25 years later
85:49 and two Emmys later he just finished
85:52 working on Top Gun what was he doing
85:55 when he enrolled in this class he was
85:58 working in a tech support department
85:59 taking you know calls on how to hook
86:01 your computer up to the Internet how to
86:03 get email to work what'd he do before
86:04 that he was climbing telephone poles
86:07 installing cable what'd he do before
86:09 that he has a legendary band called dr.
86:12 know which he toured for approximately
86:15 10 years in the 80s so he went through a
86:18 bunch of different careers talk about a
86:20 dude who's bald his whole life and I
86:23 don't mean the crying kind he's in
86:25 control of his destiny I don't think
86:28 he'll ever allow himself to be out of
86:30 control of his destiny but he's born
86:33 from the same you know pool of primary
86:38 par Morial make-believe booze that says
86:42 there's no job underneath him as well a
86:44 lot of us are like that hope you're like
86:47 that well the most fun I've ever had was
86:51 helping my buddy run his pizzeria an
86:54 Italian restaurant I got to make pizza I
86:57 got to make Italian dishes I got
86:58 to talk to customers I got to bus tables
87:00 what was I doing during the day I was
87:03 across the treatment street making video
87:04 games for HBO okay so it's fun get out
87:09 there and do everything that you thought
87:11 you would never do don't worry about
87:12 what anyone else thinks on your deathbed
87:15 are you gonna give a [ __ ] what anyone
87:17 else thinks of your life but you and
87:18 your family if you've been a good person
87:21 you've helped people and you've lived
87:22 the life that you wanted to live yeah
87:25 who cares if you had a formal education
87:28 again if you can get one and it's based
87:30 on a trade skill go for it tear up the
87:34 world nut trade skill and you'll you'll
87:36 learn like all of us that as soon as you
87:38 get out of college that's when you
87:39 started understanding what it is you
87:41 wanted to do with your life but it's
87:43 good to have a little fallback if you
87:45 can so for those of you are young start
87:50 playing now so when you get to college
87:52 you got your stuff you got your major in
87:55 your heart if you don't maybe hold off
87:58 maybe go to a junior college until you
87:59 figure out what you love go do a bunch
88:02 of stuff that you've been dying to do be
88:05 realistic right if there's a if there's
88:08 a new industry out there and there's a
88:09 huge demand for but that's already like
88:11 already saturated with people maybe look
88:14 around for another one
88:15 when I was a kid in the eighties they
88:17 said you know software engineering is
88:19 gonna be is the highest thing in demand
88:21 and it's going to go forever well that I
88:23 lucked out because not only did we have
88:25 the computerization of analog data all
88:28 right which is what Ross Perot did back
88:29 in the day with his systems was a TDS or
88:34 whatever it was probably that wrong
88:36 but the internet exploded with HTTP
88:40 protocol boom whole nother juice in my
88:43 my veins another adrenaline shot of
88:46 opportunity money and all kinds of stuff
88:48 you know I sat I wanted to give you guys
88:51 this analogy before or this this case
88:53 study of my own life before this episode
88:56 is over and it's again it's not the two
88:57 pond horn this is just to show you how
88:59 powerful it is how powerful passion is
89:02 in in in juxtapose to this formalized
89:09 Prussian
89:10 approach to your life right this Drive
89:13 the education down into your soul thing
89:15 I was working on Electronic Arts and we
89:18 were building a a.com it was the 310
89:21 million dollar project and I never
89:24 thought in a million years that a year
89:26 earlier when I took over a six-man team
89:29 of coders that I would be one of the
89:31 lead architects on this project but I
89:34 was sitting at home every day leading up
89:37 to this job now this is how I transition
89:39 I was doing database coding during the
89:41 day they're big giant corporations and a
89:44 big government projects and all kinds of
89:45 stuff like helping people do it and
89:47 developing the core technologies that
89:48 they would use to then put into their
89:50 systems
89:50 but I was looking at this internet thing
89:52 and I was like man I really want to
89:54 understand this this is amazing
89:55 so I work at eight-hour day come home
89:58 and work a four hour day at home and I
90:00 was on the edge I mean I was into all
90:03 kinds of animation in web browsers
90:05 before there was any flash and that kind
90:07 of stuff you know using timer loops and
90:09 all this other crazy JavaScript Dom
90:12 stuff before react and all that stuff
90:14 came out and so I because I was used to
90:17 making a ton of money and I wanted to
90:20 keep making tons of money and so I
90:21 transitioned out of this database job
90:23 which was a very unique and I was the
90:25 top of the game in that realm and I
90:27 jumped over into the internet and
90:29 because I had an art background and a
90:31 programming background when I show my
90:32 portfolio off not only was it gorgeous
90:34 it worked well it was like mind-blowing
90:37 people like Jesus yeah definitely hire
90:39 this kid I transitioned with the $5,000
90:42 difference in my paycheck but I was
90:45 making you know $80,000 a year at 27
90:50 years old in the 90s right I just talked
90:53 to some guy the other day he said if he
90:54 had a PhD he gets into the school system
90:56 here locally he could make $80,000 in
91:00 ten years
91:00 this is 2019 for Christ's sake right
91:03 this is the power of living in your
91:05 dreams but so I worked for this company
91:07 for about a year and a half
91:08 again I'm contracting on the side video
91:10 game music and a bunch of other stuff on
91:12 the side right at my own software
91:14 company on the side still marketing
91:16 products back to that database industry
91:19 when I got the job opportunity to manage
91:22 these coders I had to go in and these
91:24 a bunch of young guys that work at a
91:26 videogame company so they're used to the
91:27 coolest planet on you know her coolest
91:29 place on planet Earth and so I went in
91:31 and I had to sell myself culturally I
91:33 said look man I'm like you man I like
91:35 all the cool stuff and I do all this
91:36 other stuff and then go man that's cool
91:38 you're gonna be our boss I said well if
91:40 you tell your boss that you like me yeah
91:42 it was a nine-hour interview I met
91:44 everybody there two weeks went by and I
91:46 never got a call back and I was like
91:47 Jesus Christ man I thought I nailed this
91:49 and so I finally called the guy got him
91:51 on his cell phone he want to take me
91:53 down another $5,000 now makin 75 grand
91:56 I'm doing more so I went in I took it
91:59 because I know if I got in everything
92:01 could happen sure enough everything
92:04 happened I got in there and I found out
92:06 they were working out this deal with AOL
92:09 to start this big giant online gaming
92:12 platform and so I just couldn't do
92:15 anything but manage my coders well then
92:16 two people resigned internally my team
92:19 grew to 24
92:20 now I'm managing the artists the coders
92:23 and the producers well I had done all
92:29 those jobs at those previous jobs found
92:32 out they had no process inside what all
92:34 these documents on how to do it and use
92:36 the Best of Breed from everyone else if
92:38 you want too many people like I said ask
92:39 them what their best day was documented
92:42 make sure it takes care of all the you
92:44 know crosses all the T's and dot saw the
92:46 eyes and then present it back to them
92:47 and say would you mind doing it like
92:49 this every single time instant buying
92:51 cuz they're like hell yeah that's the
92:52 best day we've ever had you want us to
92:54 do that all the time yes I do
92:57 we had a guy who was gonna get fired
92:59 ended up being our top employee because
93:02 he loved the process well then this
93:05 thing finally gets greenlit
93:06 we hired this big giant consulting firm
93:09 called Anderson consulting they were
93:11 charged in this two and a half million
93:12 dollars a month all right but they
93:16 weren't getting [ __ ] done they put all
93:18 these gorgeous women in one of their
93:20 tactics was to rotate all their
93:22 employees through coding even if they
93:24 weren't coders they all these gorgeous
93:25 women in there whether it would they do
93:26 they would literally walk up to the
93:28 smartest nerd this was a tactic it was
93:31 amazing and they said well you know I
93:33 can't figure out my code you want to sit
93:35 next to a hot girl and do my job in your
93:37 job at the same time and the
93:38 kids were like sure baby and they sat
93:40 there and did these other people's jobs
93:41 unbelievable finally we got a new CTO in
93:45 and he was awesome he was an ass-kicker
93:47 first I had to teach him the Internet
93:50 and teach the CEO Internet I had to
93:52 teach head of games Internet all these
93:54 like secret educational sessions so no
93:56 one would seem stupid in these
93:57 conversations okay
94:01 then it came time to finally start
94:04 making this big gigantic 310 million
94:06 dollar platform eighty-seven went out
94:09 the door to to AOL and the rest was
94:11 spent on production they were having
94:14 this huge meeting to figure out how to
94:16 do this product how to structure to
94:18 different back in languages talking at
94:20 the same time my friends his name's Mick
94:23 was another gigantic genius and the two
94:26 of us got this damn thing done he did
94:29 something utterly brilliant he D
94:31 compiled some Apache software and create
94:33 a little router that handled the dual
94:35 platforms together for any of you
94:36 understand that it was ingenious he
94:39 totally like ripped apart ik executed
94:41 precompiled piece of code ripped it
94:43 apart rewrote it and put it back
94:44 together and he became a star real quick
94:47 over the next year I had three $15,000
94:51 raises I already had tons of stock
94:53 options I had a huge ass bonus at the
94:55 end of the year and talking about deep
94:57 five digit bonus but I walked into this
95:01 room and I'm looking at two partners
95:04 from Anderson consulting plus all their
95:07 employees plus all of our brilliant
95:08 people and they couldn't figure this
95:10 thing out
95:11 and I'm listening I'm listening I'm
95:13 listening now no one told me to do what
95:15 I did next I'm 29 years old I just said
95:19 guys I said enough of this enough of
95:23 this I went up to the whiteboard got my
95:25 marker and I said it's real simple it's
95:27 not we're going to do it I laid the
95:29 entire architecture for this thing out
95:30 on the board I said anyone have any
95:32 questions no that looks good oh my god
95:35 that's it drop the mic walk out of the
95:38 room one of my players were up behind me
95:40 is like well we shoot that was awesome
95:42 two and a half million dollars a month
95:44 formal educated people couldn't figure
95:47 out how to [ __ ] an architect this thing
95:50 unbeliev
95:51 I'm afraid Mik I believe he's got at
95:52 least a bachelor's and he may even have
95:55 more nowadays but he's just he wouldn't
95:57 have had to add that he's a genius
95:59 anyway so two kids go in there and just
96:02 own this thing unbelievable right I went
96:06 first
96:06 he went second at a different meeting it
96:09 gave me star power within the company I
96:12 was super young super knowledgeable you
96:15 need to know anything well he's the one
96:16 that taught us secretly in the back room
96:19 you can do all of this stuff and
96:22 whatever it is you love just get into it
96:25 and love it and you'll be so astonished
96:27 what people will pay you to do because
96:30 to you it's a cinch and to you it won't
96:32 even be work it'll be your love it'll be
96:36 your passion man
96:38 don't sell yourself short and if you're
96:42 in the middle of this right now and
96:43 you're you know you're just getting a
96:44 little bit of inertia a little bit of
96:48 resistance that maybe sort of taken the
96:51 steam out of your sail well hopefully
96:52 this episode will reenergize you go back
96:54 to episode or season 1 excuse me look
96:57 through all the titles some of that
97:00 stuff is not having viewable in Europe
97:03 because of some of the 15-second
97:06 soundtracks I used at the beginning I
97:08 think I've made the executive decision
97:10 now since I have all those backed up I
97:11 am going to look at all the ones that
97:14 are limited because of the music and I'm
97:17 going to create probably a brand new
97:19 season 1 intro and fix all those songs
97:23 get them all out of there and then
97:24 re-upload the whole season 1 for you
97:27 guys so you guys can see the ones that
97:29 you perhaps can't see if you're outside
97:30 the United States of America I hope this
97:34 was valuable to you I have helped
97:38 hundreds and hundreds of people get
97:41 these dreams with less information that
97:44 I've given you guys on this show you
97:46 don't have to sign up to anything
97:47 there's no like you know subscription to
97:50 this kind of stuff you can you can thank
97:52 me on patreon if you make a ton of money
97:53 I want you to be happy I want to
97:56 experience what you create
97:58 there's so many listeners out there have
98:00 these little businesses on the side and
98:02 it's just fantastic to see what they do
98:04 and you know most of its alway before
98:06 they ever heard a lick of my
98:08 pontification what does the Rob
98:11 Schneider says you can do it that's you
98:14 man you can do it completely and you
98:18 know it's it's interesting because some
98:19 people will be like I have medical
98:22 issues right I don't feel comfort
98:24 feeling a medical condition alright let
98:28 me give you a little secret
98:29 you start doing something that you love
98:31 and I mean if you can just work your
98:33 hands if you can just talk if you can
98:35 communicate to another human being they
98:37 can do it for you if you're completely
98:39 paralyzed from the neck down well this
98:41 is what I want to do I got an idea
98:43 and someone's gonna be right there next
98:45 to you going dude I don't have a passion
98:47 yet you do if I can help you get your
98:49 passion then maybe I'll find my own
98:51 passion but maybe I'll like what you're
98:52 doing and I'll put it all together for
98:53 you right so you can always pull this
98:57 thing off if you have breath in your
99:00 body you can pull this off and and
99:03 believe it or not you will start
99:06 inspiring people around you to do the
99:08 same passion seeking thing share all of
99:11 your tricks share all of your sources if
99:14 you've had that moment where you know
99:17 you had to go back and get a formal
99:19 education and you got your dream we'll
99:21 share that idea share that whole
99:22 experience and but make sure you don't
99:24 just share just the successes everybody
99:27 can fall into successes that's not a big
99:28 deal share all the moments in your life
99:31 where you thought you were going to give
99:33 up or you thought this was the end of
99:36 the road but you kept going and then
99:38 Kapow it all happened make sure you
99:41 share everything there's one thing I
99:42 used to teach back in the 90s I used to
99:45 have this website that taught this just
99:47 one little lesson that everybody needs
99:48 to understand when you start doing
99:51 something you commit to a project and
99:53 you start working at it every day it
99:56 sometimes often okay will get really
100:00 difficult the difficulty ramps starts
100:03 ramping up and ramping up like crazy and
100:05 you start to think oh my god I have
100:07 bitten off way too much maybe God is
100:09 trying to give me a sign that I
100:11 shouldn't be doing this but you know
100:13 what the truth is everyone who succeeds
100:16 has been through that apparatus and what
100:19 they know is one little special secret
100:20 that I want to make sure all of you know
100:21 it's gonna ramp up ramp up ramp up and
100:24 then it's going to peak it won't get any
100:27 harder because it's as hard as it could
100:29 get and you're gonna go through that
100:30 fleeting emotion as it starts to level
100:32 off and plateau and then guess what
100:35 happens there's this epiphany this
100:37 moment any of you play video games and
100:39 try to beat a boss in a video game you
100:40 know this firsthand you find out the
100:45 thing you're supposed to do you find out
100:47 the thing that breaks you through the
100:48 barrier and all of a sudden that
100:50 difficulty skyrockets down everything
100:54 clicks in your head you start to see
100:57 this thing you were trying to build
100:59 which it had no form and function starts
101:02 to take take shape maybe it's not
101:04 exactly the way you thought it would be
101:06 Syd Mead it tolls me to this day that
101:08 when he paints it's still not exactly
101:09 the way he sees it in his head and the
101:11 way sees in his head is better than any
101:13 what he paints I'm like really I'd love
101:15 to be in your brain for one second dude
101:17 but it drops down and then Kapow you
101:21 were shot out of the barrel faster than
101:22 you could possibly imagine is what we
101:24 call the success wave and even if again
101:27 the very first time you do it it's sort
101:29 of a Frankenstein thing guarantee the
101:31 second time you do it's better so know
101:34 that the people that are super
101:35 successful know this happens I guarantee
101:37 you every single director who's ever
101:39 making made a film every single
101:41 screenwriters every one a screenplay to
101:43 get to that point where you're like I
101:44 think this is [ __ ] what have I done I'm
101:47 gonna get fired but they keep going and
101:50 keep going and they feel that drop they
101:53 feel the success they get the awards get
101:55 the accolades they get famous and then
101:57 the next time they make a movie now do
101:59 whatever they do they feel that
102:04 difficulty and they feel it level off
102:06 it's like if you eat a hot pepper you
102:08 eat that hot pepper and ramps it ramps
102:10 and ramps and ramps you think you're
102:11 gonna die and then finally levels off
102:13 and then your adrenaline floods into
102:14 your system you feel like you're
102:15 floating on air and all sudden it starts
102:17 to drop off they seek that wave
102:21 they seek that pattern
102:23 so I don't want you guys giving up as
102:25 well just because it gets really hard I
102:29 have family members that have given up
102:31 just cuz it got hard they think there's
102:34 a sign that they're gonna fail and they
102:36 want to avoid failure at all costs even
102:38 if they have to judge themselves for the
102:39 failure and then of course there's the
102:41 old Edison analogy you created 10,000
102:43 light bulbs before one worked all right
102:46 pick your pick your poison it all leads
102:50 to success and sure it's being birthed
102:53 into your success it's going through
102:55 that eye of the needle but I tell you
102:57 what there's nothing you'll be more
102:59 proud of than that journey through the
103:01 eye of the needle especially when you
103:04 get on the other side it's an obligatory
103:06 moment in time meaning it is something
103:08 that is guaranteed to occur and leave
103:13 you one final note before I sign off for
103:15 those of you who want to be artists I
103:17 have a little analogy I tell kids but I
103:20 tell it to adults has actually more
103:21 impact on the adults I say look if you
103:24 have the power to illustrate the
103:26 alphabet whether you have to draw it
103:28 slow or quickly you can make a through Z
103:30 in your language then you have the
103:33 mechanical skills to draw anything in
103:35 the world because within the geometry of
103:39 all the letters in the alphabet you have
103:41 the aptitude to remember the symbol and
103:44 draw it if you had to you look at a
103:48 picture and every single line in my face
103:50 is a letter in the alphabet maybe it's
103:53 only a little twist of a single letter
103:55 you're like oh that's that part of the
103:57 are yeah are I'm all gonna draw that
104:00 little bump on the top of the art well
104:02 there's the whatever the pimple and the
104:04 guy's face whatever understand that we
104:08 have all this ability just sitting there
104:10 and we know we have the ability you just
104:13 need to play with your mind to the point
104:14 you can actually get it to be fruitful
104:17 for you all right it's a long ass
104:21 episode but hopefully that is valuable
104:23 to you I love these kind of things
104:24 because now we're getting out of the
104:25 darkness getting it back into our where
104:27 I really want deep thoughts to be
104:29 speaking of if you haven't been to deep
104:32 thoughts radio.com please go that's
104:34 where you get the audio and the video
104:37 switch feed you won't have it in the car
104:38 you're gonna finish half of it at home
104:40 on your phone and then if you don't have
104:41 that that one is it the red subscription
104:43 on YouTube you can't download it to your
104:45 phone the YouTube excuse me the podcast
104:48 is around the front as I'm always saying
104:51 in episodes we have a great locked
104:52 facebook group it's locked so we can
104:54 keep a lot of the spammers we're getting
104:56 a lot of people joining that I'm suspect
104:59 of whether or not they're actually real
105:01 people what I'll probably end up doing
105:03 is clean out cleaning out a ton of
105:05 members that don't post or contribute
105:08 may just be a little boss sitting in
105:10 there and none of them ever try to post
105:11 anything bad so we don't have that
105:13 problem there's a Twitter account in
105:16 case those of you who hate all the other
105:18 platforms you like Twitter but you want
105:20 to have a little bit of a notification
105:21 but if you have a podcast reader it'll
105:24 let you know new episodes come down if
105:25 you set it up right and we have the
105:27 patreon page so any of you who feel you
105:30 can contribute to the show financially
105:33 in any way shape or form you get
105:35 previews of all the episodes 24 8 to 24
105:38 hour hours beforehand sometimes days if
105:40 I'm wanting to do a double release on
105:43 the weekend I just did a double release
105:45 this is a Thursday so at the time of
105:48 this recording episode 348 just went out
105:50 the door tonight it's been very
105:51 successful as just a kind of a footnote
105:57 you know I I do want to keep the show
106:00 out of dark subjects and lately I've had
106:02 to deal with a bunch of things that I
106:03 think are very important I don't want
106:06 the show to to produce acid in your body
106:09 if you know what I mean I want it to be
106:12 inspiring at times so these are these
106:14 episodes that I absolutely love to do
106:16 because again if I could just give you
106:18 my brain if I could just upload a bunch
106:20 of things and have kind of a brainstorm
106:22 machine and you guys could play it back
106:24 if you haven't seen the movie brainstorm
106:26 you are truly denying yourself an
106:28 amazing movie but if I could give you
106:31 everything I had like a matrix plug-in
106:33 I would definitely post that somewhere
106:35 so you could get it and get your dreams
106:38 this is the best way I know how to do it
106:41 plus if I have a really good show then
106:44 you get to see the best performance that
106:46 I've ever had on this particular subject
106:47 matter so go take care of yourself and
106:51 someone else and I'll see in the next
106:52 deep valence over now
