00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen okay well where are the last
00:37 three episodes of this particular season
00:40 there will be more episodes during the
00:41 summertime as bonuses but I can't vouch
00:44 for how frequent they'll be we are in
00:48 the battle of for the Republic at this
00:49 point right
00:51 the deep state organizations have
00:54 launched the co vid pre-planned as
00:59 evidenced by the 2012 London Olympics
01:02 ceremonies where they completely showed
01:04 you what they were going to do with the
01:05 stage the shape of a covert virus with
01:10 the grim reaper with dancers playing
01:13 patients and nurses and stuff
01:16 hochy saying before Trump got into
01:19 office that for sure he would be facing
01:21 a pandemic Joe Biden last year talking
01:26 about a pandemic problem and what is it
01:28 October 20 19
01:29 they all knew this was coming they all
01:32 put it together hmm and then they
01:37 assumed you're so stupid
01:39 that you can't figure it out you know it
01:42 does take a little bit of help you know
01:44 people find things and show it to you
01:45 and then you find things you show it to
01:47 them today this week last week of May
01:52 they are fighting it over fighting over
01:55 the censorship and on social media
01:59 especially now some people have like
02:02 ten-year-old thinking that it says oh
02:05 well a private company has the right to
02:08 censor however they like and in some
02:10 cases racism sexual deviance all kinds
02:14 of hate speech sure it's gotta be really
02:18 poignant evil hate speech it just can't
02:20 be I disagree with what you say
02:21 therefore it's hate speech ya can't do
02:24 it but here's the here's the precipice
02:26 that if you cross you got a bit of a
02:28 legal issue which is when you become a
02:31 utility for society and I think that we
02:36 can hands-down say that Facebook Twitter
02:39 Instagram and YouTube as a matter of
02:43 fact it's starting to become a utility
02:46 you know the TV is starting to go to
02:48 youtube all the time with these you know
02:50 Android OS TVs I watch it all the time
02:54 and in terms of the precipice between
02:58 you know
03:00 a private company and utility for things
03:03 like Facebook and Twitter I shouldn't
03:04 have mentioned Instagram it barely has
03:06 anything to do with anything the big
03:08 deal err is that when society starts to
03:10 derive its reality from these platforms
03:13 to a significant degree that is where
03:16 they become in most classical cases
03:21 utilities now utilities in general were
03:24 like telephones were utilities
03:26 electricity was utilities well you
03:29 probably could say you need electricity
03:31 to survive a winter or summer but you
03:34 don't need a telephone to survive living
03:37 it's just a luxury of communication so
03:40 you can see just for your own mind
03:42 there's a bit of a similarity there
03:46 plantigrade similarity but what is this
03:49 episode about I promised you guys I'm
03:53 gonna go through these these
03:57 doppelg√§nger folks that continually show
03:59 up at multiple events they look they
04:02 look identical meaning it appears as if
04:05 some people look like they're the same
04:07 people between events we obviously have
04:10 a name for that now what's interesting
04:14 about this is that it means something to
04:19 have a bunch of IMDB actors from around
04:22 the world all converging at a location
04:24 that just so happens to have a mass
04:28 shooting event happen at that place you
04:30 know if it was a mass shooting at an
04:32 acting agency it makes complete sense
04:34 all these actors are there they have
04:36 credentials they've made movies they've
04:38 done things overtime makes sense just
04:40 was a bad place to be at the you know at
04:45 that particular time so I did a bunch of
04:48 research over this last week since I
04:51 told you guys that I was going in this
04:53 direction and there's some interesting
04:58 things we're gonna have to play dumb on
04:59 this episode a little bit so I'm gonna
05:01 play stupid you're gonna know what I'm
05:03 saying but that'll insert a bunch of
05:07 fuzziness for this video getting
05:11 censored and this channel getting
05:12 censored and people getting all butthurt
05:14 and
05:14 trying to do to this channel what they
05:17 did to other channels you know the the
05:23 one thing that we've misunderstood is
05:25 the truth movement or slash the Great
05:26 Awakening is that we haven't calculated
05:28 that the the side that's doing these
05:34 things would be creating disinformation
05:36 towards us I mean we do when we don't
05:40 for instance when you go and look up
05:42 crisis actors in Google you get a bunch
05:47 of really bad images so you go over to
05:50 DuckDuckGo you get a slightly better
05:54 group of photographs but I've noticed
05:56 something there are people inserted into
05:58 photographs that were never in the
06:01 previous batch when this whole thing
06:03 came about
06:07 now a good friend of mine had dinner
06:08 with one of these folks it was the
06:11 gentleman who showed up at 9/11 it was
06:13 also showed up at the International
06:16 Airport in Los Angeles lax International
06:19 Airport he did not have a ticket to go
06:21 anywhere he just so happened to be
06:23 walking around with the backpack
06:25 having this total eye witness thing
06:27 happened where he was like you know
06:29 pitching the the narrative and things
06:31 very interesting and what's fascinating
06:35 about this because I'm gonna get this
06:37 out very quickly is I want to get a
06:41 point out there fairly quick which is
06:42 this you were to forget every single
06:45 mass shooting that's ever happened
06:47 you're not to remember parkland Sandy
06:51 Hook Boston bombing all this stuff
06:54 you're not to remember that stuff it
06:57 should be in the press right any of you
07:00 that remember the Oklahoma City bombing
07:02 by guy we followed that case we followed
07:06 McVeigh we followed him all the way to
07:08 his execution he was in the news
07:11 videotapes of him every time he was
07:13 hauled from point A to point B they
07:14 filmed him when he had his meetings with
07:17 the DEA or whatever it was filmed with
07:20 this controller guy sitting next to him
07:23 but today you're not to remember
07:25 anything are you because it's flawed and
07:29 it's good issues who knows exactly what
07:32 occurred you know and any one of these
07:34 things we have feelings we got videos
07:36 that make us feel like certain things
07:37 happened I think the gist of it is that
07:41 it happened it smells bad I think that
07:45 in some cases maybe they have only
07:49 killed the people that they accuse of
07:51 the crime so if there's a particular
07:53 shooter that person is definitely
07:55 murdered and I think as we started to
07:58 unravel I hate to say it as we started
08:01 to unravel the fraud of what they were
08:03 doing they started making the decision
08:05 to go ahead and kill people in great
08:07 numbers but now let me ask you in the
08:11 last 15 years when all these shootings
08:13 happen and you know a ton of them my god
08:16 I don't even know I I think I heard the
08:17 number over 40 during Obama's
08:19 administration
08:22 were you allowed to ever forget Charles
08:27 Manson we didn't kill a single person
08:29 but was blamed for a bunch of hippies
08:31 taking drugs and going over and killing
08:33 the Tate's and everybody else no uh-uh
08:36 were you ever allowed to forget Ted
08:38 Bundy Son of Sam Zodiac killer any of
08:42 these folks Oh No
08:45 well you know what's strange is we for
08:48 now had shootings in Canada just
08:50 recently that took away all the guns up
08:52 there I don't know anything about that
08:53 case what the guns are gone Churchland
08:56 shooting in New Zealand or Church Christ
08:59 whatever things didn't anything more
09:02 about that you know if you had the
09:03 videotape of the fake CG footage because
09:06 there's two different tapes it looks
09:07 like someone released the demo reel
09:09 which was for internal use only where
09:12 the the shells were popping either gonna
09:13 disappearing in mid-flight you know I
09:15 was in video game for 25 years any time
09:19 we made a gun with shells you had to
09:21 program that stuff they're all over the
09:22 ground any time you go to a shooting
09:24 range and someone's popping out shells
09:27 from a five five six or 308 one they're
09:30 hot as hell when they're big rounds
09:32 they're big shells then they should be
09:34 on the ground when you get done you need
09:37 to step very carefully because you could
09:39 slip and fall on your own rounds you
09:41 know what on the guy next to you but the
09:44 new photos have sown in people that we
09:46 have never accused of being a part of
09:48 this group and what does that allow them
09:51 to do well for those of us they're awake
09:54 we can see the other ones and then just
09:56 go yeah whatever that's just some weird
09:58 person someone's stuck in the photograph
09:59 but we don't need to be awakened because
10:03 we've already taken the red pill we take
10:05 it every day we've taken a red pill like
10:06 almost like a vaccine we're just a week
10:08 and there's nothing you can do to put us
10:10 down besides injuring us or killing us
10:14 but it's for anyone that's sitting on
10:16 the fence who doesn't want to go through
10:18 this kubler-ross you know anger denial
10:21 negotiation and acceptance they don't
10:23 want to go through that phase and then
10:24 end up where they woke up at 8 o clock
10:27 in the morning in the world was great
10:28 they had their head in the sand like an
10:30 ostrich
10:30 I guess ostriches do that
10:33 go to sleep at night terrified her or
10:36 can't sleep at night because now they
10:38 they don't know how to you know filter
10:40 this amazing amount of new information
10:42 that the world is completely different
10:43 completely evil Epstein was just the tip
10:46 of the iceberg kind of thing right so
10:48 they go to utilities to have their
10:51 nerves calmed all they want to hear
10:54 ever ever ever is someone tell them that
10:57 it's not true tell me this is not true
10:59 it's not true Oh God thank you so
11:03 Google's working overtime to make sure
11:05 that the deep state gets what it wants
11:08 they are I hate to say it I'm going to
11:12 read you a blacklist file a censorship
11:16 file not the whole thing because it's
11:19 like I don't know 30 pages long I'm
11:22 gonna read you what they're blocking
11:24 from your site and you'll kind of
11:29 through reverse engineering you don't
11:32 get the idea that they are indeed
11:35 participating in cover-ups because you
11:38 should be able to get any information
11:40 about you know within privacy respect
11:45 about the Manson murders right which
11:48 again he wasn't there but all of those
11:51 serial killers how many people just
11:52 really get into that kind of stuff I got
11:54 a buddy from high school he gets into an
11:55 article he's got a Facebook page Reed
11:57 gets into all the old you know gangsters
12:00 from back in the day and he loves
12:01 researching all that stuff and that's
12:03 his thing it's cool but now imagine him
12:05 trying to search on that stuff and all
12:07 of a sudden you can't find anything
12:08 because it connects over to the Federal
12:09 Reserve or it connects over to agenda21
12:12 well that's what's going on today things
12:15 are gagged can't see certain things well
12:18 that's not what this country was founded
12:20 on it was founded on the Republic the
12:22 Constitution freedom of speech etc and
12:27 you need to brace yourself that any
12:30 institution can deny anything and we
12:32 don't have the ability to verify it
12:35 while we're the other what I'm about to
12:39 read from is a PDF that came from the
12:43 guy that
12:44 affected from Google and was then held
12:46 at gunpoint in San Francisco took his
12:50 case to Project Veritas now there's
12:52 something very interesting and I didn't
12:56 have a chance to email Project Veritas
12:58 and get a response to them before I get
13:00 this video done it just occurred to me
13:02 today late today that that's something I
13:04 should have done if I could have but
13:07 they have removed that project from
13:10 their entire website you can find legacy
13:14 links to the don't be evil separated by
13:19 underscores if from the search engines
13:23 into Veritas website it's all gone I
13:27 mean I can understand them taking down
13:29 the download because it was four hundred
13:30 Meg's and maybe that would creates a big
13:32 bandwidth problem for them but there's
13:33 no story of it anymore so I need to
13:37 preface this because I just figured this
13:39 out before I tell you all this stuff but
13:43 this is called the YouTube controversial
13:47 seriously controversial query blacklist
13:50 PDF inside the file it's called
13:54 literally in the YouTube controversial
13:59 twit ler Twi ddle our query blacklist I
14:05 have forgotten names of these
14:08 individuals the first I'm gonna say my
14:15 god twelve thirteen pages of this this
14:23 is I'm gonna do a little zoom up on it
14:25 it looks like Google is extremely
14:28 worried about anyone searching on the
14:30 Las Vegas shooting if you remember and I
14:34 had forgotten a guy's name Steven
14:35 paddock ste PhD in PA D D Ock was the
14:41 shooter and in the official narrative
14:43 right now we can only speculate why
14:48 there is at least a dozen pages in this
14:52 document or it's one line another line
14:56 another lie another line its little
14:57 phrase
14:58 is that if you search in google they're
15:00 gonna use these phrases to block your
15:02 search I can tell you as a coder I can
15:06 see class names in here at the very
15:07 beginning who knows if this is fake or
15:10 real but this would be a lot of work if
15:14 it was fake now the true do not be evil
15:18 download PDF sorry zip excuse me has
15:22 tons of presentations that people took
15:25 pictures of as employees of Google and
15:28 what have you but this thing has every
15:31 well I don't know it has literally
15:34 dozens and dozens of methods of looking
15:36 up the attack on Las Vegas they spell
15:38 Las Vegas wrong every way they possibly
15:40 can l OS VA GES va-jay-jay a SSS I mean
15:49 it's crazy
15:50 you are absolutely not allowed to see
15:53 the Vegas shooting information now why
15:56 would they put so much effort into
15:57 blocking this because they have a
16:01 mistake in it
16:02 super duper mistake they have Steven
16:07 paddock and then virtually every
16:09 conceivable search you could have after
16:12 his name Steven pada in a room in room
16:16 time of death is a Democrat is
16:20 anti-trump is he real I mean it just
16:25 goes on and on I'm still scrolling and
16:27 I'm still just looking at Steven
16:28 paddocks name I don't know exactly what
16:31 page I'm on let's see see if I could
16:36 find a page number I'm on 16 of 40 looks
16:42 like that's pretty much where it start
16:43 starts to end so 16 pages of Las Vegas
16:49 one line per phrase all the way down and
16:55 then it gets to the dude who went on the
16:56 mat what is it the Brooklyn Bridge or
17:00 the Manhattan Bridge and he did a
17:01 shooting where this goes on and on and
17:03 on the Sutherland Church shooting
17:08 Texas Church shooting Rancho Tehama
17:13 won't even know these places are all
17:15 about shooter shooter so essentially it
17:21 looks like to me and now we're at the
17:26 point where is bad crisis actors
17:28 compilation that's blocked crisis actors
17:33 spelled a million different ways what
17:36 I'm about to say are the words after and
17:40 I'll put this on the screen crisis actor
17:42 so the first two words of every single
17:44 thing I'm about to say is crisis sector
17:46 and did in this race right caught Christ
17:51 Hearst calls boyfriend compilation crink
17:54 crunk
17:55 David Brown horror and tragedy I lost my
17:58 20 year old Las Vegas
18:00 still in Las Vegas now right now in
18:02 politics Oscars 2017 recycles swan Vega
18:05 I could just go on for it probably take
18:09 me 20 minutes just to get through a few
18:12 pages to be bored to death so when we
18:17 talk about censorship from Google if
18:21 this document is legit and I have to say
18:23 that a hundred percent if it is legit
18:26 then there's some explainin to do right
18:29 why are you protecting all of these
18:31 crisis actors is that part of your
18:33 censorship is that part of hate speech
18:36 hardly it's citizens of the United
18:39 States of America trying to get down get
18:42 facts down so they can form a thought in
18:45 their brain as to who it's for them and
18:47 who's against them I have a feeling and
18:51 this is the reason why I'm dedicating an
18:52 episode to this today is that within
18:59 2020 especially if Trump wins this year
19:02 the next four years after this year
19:05 starting next year
19:06 censorship will be a gigantic thing huge
19:10 thing if we lose the Great Awakening and
19:14 we allow them to tell us when we have to
19:18 wear a mask that doesn't protect us to
19:19 games viruses for
19:21 instance you realize that they have had
19:24 to admit at the CDC that none of these
19:25 masks protect us against anything
19:28 ninety-five masks if it is fitted to you
19:30 and and put on you in a clean room and
19:35 you never take it off yes right here
19:38 you'd be ok but your eyes will accept
19:43 all kinds of stuff bacteria we need pink
19:46 guys all about right but again a
19:48 bacteria there's like the size of your
19:51 house and a virus compared to a bacteria
19:54 would still be a human hair compared to
19:57 the house right a molecule versus a
20:02 single or multi cell being it's just a
20:05 gigantic order of magnitude different
20:08 the telling us that we have to wear
20:10 masks everywhere for these businesses
20:12 that open back up you're supposed to be
20:15 able go to a restaurant put food in your
20:16 mouth
20:16 but you're supposed to wear a mask at
20:18 the grocery store seriously you said a
20:22 long time ago that gloves really bad
20:24 gloves just spread it all over the place
20:25 but I still see people wearing gloves
20:29 they're now estimating that the you know
20:33 the death rate is at least one-tenth of
20:36 what was reported suspiciously high in
20:39 democratic states incredibly low and
20:42 republican states and as of tonight
20:45 Japan is opening their country back up
20:47 they have 126 million people stuffed
20:50 into an island I mean talk about a lack
20:52 of social distancing that they never
20:54 shut their country down and they've only
20:58 had 869 people passed and I mean
21:01 obviously if that's accurate
21:04 we mourn their deaths and hopefully it
21:07 wasn't due to Cove it it was due to
21:08 something pre-existing condition I mean
21:10 if you had to pick something at least
21:14 you could then have closure that your
21:15 relative didn't pass early due to this
21:18 mishap in the wuhan bo so for lab right
21:22 you know the the other documentary play
21:26 endemic by Judy Mike Ovitz Mike Ovitz
21:35 she's been trying to blow whistles on
21:37 foxy and a bunch of other people YouTube
21:41 will take it down as a second show
21:43 upload it's over I'm bid shoot bi TCH
21:45 ute calm she was in a previous interview
21:50 / mini you know YouTube video on the
21:55 ever-blooming
21:57 epoch times and she was with some other
22:02 virologists and what-have-you but this
22:04 is when they you know announced that s
22:05 protein had been moved from the 2003
22:09 SARS virus over to Wisc Ovid and of
22:13 course it's got what I believe I've
22:15 heard up to this point three different
22:16 patents around the world for this thing
22:18 that we're suffering from but they won't
22:21 allow you to see what she has to say
22:25 because it's so utterly damning and
22:28 what's interesting is is imagine that
22:31 your government doesn't ban anything but
22:34 gets accused of banning everything and a
22:36 dictatorship you know this whole thing
22:38 of accusing Trump of being a dictator
22:40 and he's setting himself up for a
22:42 dictator yet the classical historical
22:45 truth of dictators from Stalin Mussolini
22:49 Hitler Mao Pol Pot you name it is the
22:53 socialism switched to a country and then
22:56 they take away all of your rights like
22:58 dear freedom of speech and guns this is
23:00 exactly what the left is doing under
23:03 agenda 21 but all the time accusing the
23:07 one guy that is preserving freedom of
23:10 speech preserving guns and now fighting
23:12 against censorship senator Nunez is
23:15 doing the same thing he's got a multi
23:17 hundred million dollar lawsuit against
23:20 various social media outlets we're gonna
23:23 investigate this so it's confusing for a
23:27 lot of people these pictures that I was
23:31 talking about that had been
23:34 traditionally very easy to find they
23:36 didn't have people inserted into the
23:40 pictures that we know weren't there two
23:43 years ago
23:44 allow people to jump into Snopes for
23:47 instance and read based on a in ronia
23:52 [ __ ] sure with again people added to
23:53 the photographs that we've never accused
23:55 of being a part of this whole thing and
23:58 they're able to show you well this
23:59 person lives here this person lives
24:01 there and they'll show you the different
24:02 faces but we have images I'm going to
24:05 show you people that have been reported
24:09 in two different places
24:10 dying in two different locations one
24:13 person with two different names most
24:14 definitely the same exact human being
24:16 why do we have face recognition face
24:20 recognition exists because it is like a
24:22 fingerprint no matter how much you think
24:23 you look like somebody else your face is
24:26 a fingerprint
24:26 your voice is a fingerprint and your
24:28 fingerprints a fingerprint your DNA is a
24:30 fingerprint everyone getting all of
24:33 these kovat tests you're being put in
24:36 the database now honestly there's a lot
24:39 of different things that will get us
24:41 into the database I don't know if
24:44 there's an imperative to update the data
24:47 I don't know if they're actually running
24:50 DNA sequencing systems on all of our DNA
24:53 to put us in a database who knows I
24:55 don't know what the point would be
24:56 unless you're a criminal what I find
25:01 fascinating is that in this culture you
25:04 would almost think it's a joke that if
25:06 you want up to someone and said look you
25:08 don't think for yourself you are a
25:11 parrot of television who are a parrot of
25:14 the Internet at the same exact location
25:17 at the television channel broadcast from
25:20 you're not doing any research you're not
25:23 making up your own opinion you're not
25:24 trying to see if within your mind you
25:26 have any logic circuits whatsoever you
25:30 know I think about 20 years ago I would
25:32 probably say that's very slim that
25:36 anyone has that problem and the truth of
25:40 matter was I was one of those people
25:41 twenty years ago I mean down to the moon
25:46 missions you know I had been told by two
25:49 NASA guys that they were at least one of
25:51 them was debriefed in some form or
25:53 fashion that this never took place that
25:56 they tried to
25:58 but they're coming at us full-bore mq
26:03 and on he's he's reading us the news
26:06 24/7 okay you know you find some
26:11 interesting clips and again he does have
26:13 some some very interesting points that
26:17 he makes in his post that i think is
26:19 healthy for us to think about he's just
26:21 like a really useful human being
26:23 regardless of any claims you might have
26:25 had about being a part of the trump
26:27 administration or the military NSA yeah
26:29 just just wipe all that out you know
26:31 it's like watching the last Star Wars
26:32 Star Wars 9 right you cannot possibly
26:36 watch that movie to ingest anything that
26:39 feels relatively like Star Wars we can't
26:42 you are just watching something in the
26:45 Star Wars world that has a completely
26:47 different story than the trilogy that we
26:50 watched from the seventies to the early
26:52 80s but you know what's interesting is I
26:55 realized there's a bit of a Stockholm
26:59 Syndrome lesson within the Star Wars
27:01 franchise and it has to do with Mark
27:03 Hamill who you know individually
27:07 speaking I'm sure I would have I've
27:09 always had a lot of respect for him why
27:10 wouldn't I he hasn't done anything crazy
27:12 that I know of Blizzard Malibu has a dog
27:15 he's made incredible contributions to
27:18 fun things his entire lifetime but you
27:23 know when the first Star Wars 7 came out
27:28 he was very public about the fact that
27:31 they essentially erased him from the
27:33 script when he is the main character of
27:36 all four or five and six how the hell do
27:40 you wipe the guy out he's still alive
27:42 take advantage of him for some reason
27:46 you know Carrie Fisher who hadn't been
27:49 in any major motion pictures for a
27:50 really long time looked amazing you know
27:53 she cleaned yourself up beautifully it's
27:54 so so sad she's gone she's pushed right
27:58 in front of the camera maybe you think
28:01 it's the girl power algorithm perhaps
28:03 but she was always the og you know her
28:06 and Sigourney Weaver did a great job
28:07 really providing super strong females on
28:10 film but
28:11 there's never been a shortage of those
28:12 in my opinion Harrison Ford gets a
28:16 tremendous amount of screen time right
28:17 they pretty much said Harrison Ford's
28:19 been in the film business since Star
28:21 Wars always brought in lots of ticket
28:25 sales so let's keep him up there
28:29 but Mark Hamill has been doing
28:31 voiceovers for cartoons just been doing
28:33 an amazing job and so obviously when it
28:35 first came out he was super duper pissed
28:37 off and then of course we all know he
28:42 got spanked somewhere behind the scenes
28:45 he went from a real cantankerous
28:48 interview calling the shots exactly the
28:50 way that we saw them what the hell is
28:52 Mark Hamill doing not in the movie and
28:56 why is he such a grumpy old bastard in
28:59 the film it is so unstart and so
29:03 unexplained from seven eight-nine it
29:08 will never make sense
29:09 ever ever ever it just won't now he
29:12 plays the role well of course he shows
29:15 up for work as my friend Kyle says he
29:17 earns his paycheck but then on his
29:22 personal life you know and I'm not
29:25 trying to make this a big political
29:26 problem for any one of us but it's just
29:29 very interesting if you're let's say
29:30 that you and I were aliens right works
29:32 we're studying this from the outside we
29:34 don't give a crap who's president of any
29:35 country or anything we're simply
29:37 studying the psychological
29:39 transformation of perhaps peer pressure
29:42 financial pressure other pressures we
29:45 don't know how to put a word on and we
29:47 watch Mark Hamill go from Conant like it
29:50 is being really pissed off at his own
29:52 people the liberal Hollywood thing and
29:57 then all of a sudden at some point he
30:00 gets talked to and he calms down visibly
30:03 I mean maybe you have interviews clear
30:06 up till today where he's still angry
30:07 about it I've never seen one of those
30:08 and I've watched hours and hours and
30:10 hours of Star Wars making of
30:13 documentaries about these last three
30:15 films that they just put together in his
30:18 personal life though he just gets more
30:21 and more angry at our president spends a
30:24 lot of time you know
30:25 an individual that I don't know if he's
30:28 ever met him before I don't know if he's
30:30 ever had a bad experience with him
30:31 before I sort of doubt it he seems to be
30:34 opposed to the ideology that is Trump
30:37 which is all pro America you know but
30:40 what's strange about it to me and what's
30:42 interesting just viewing it literally
30:44 totally objectively is to say that Mark
30:47 Hamill made it in the 70s when America
30:49 was phenomenal you know fun nominal he
30:54 did was it Corvette summers he got cast
30:58 on eight is enough then he gets Star
31:00 Wars then he tries to commit suicide by
31:03 driving off a cliff between Star Wars
31:05 and your prior strikes back which is why
31:07 he got the facial injury in Empire
31:10 Strikes Back at the beginning to cover
31:11 for the fact he had a scarred face
31:13 because he was a pristine kid actually
31:16 kind of helped his character quite quite
31:18 a bit I think probably psychologically
31:20 helped him as well but the world where
31:23 he would have been cast and written into
31:27 the movie seven eight and nine
31:29 unquestionably using him as a main
31:31 character you know onboarding a new
31:34 young set of replacements would have
31:37 definitely heard most likely but you
31:40 know they tried to do it with Indiana
31:41 Jones with it was a Shia LaBeouf right
31:44 they try to put him in as a replacement
31:46 for Indiana Jones and I think he did a
31:48 decent job 100% with his point in
31:51 playing the Sun it was a goofy script
31:54 and you know it took a little while to
31:55 warm up but eventually you know it
31:57 really felt like yeah he could be his
31:58 kid that's cool instead we get this
32:02 ridiculous trilogy I mean that last
32:04 movie was just was just hodgepodge ia's
32:07 could possibly be the amount of reshoots
32:09 just to make it have some cohesiveness
32:11 is phenomenal but here you have Hamill
32:16 getting screwed more and more and more
32:18 in each one of the movies he gets a
32:21 pretty decent scene in the second film
32:22 number eight where he just kind of you
32:26 know holds off all these attacking
32:30 vehicles very very cool little scene you
32:33 know but that's it the three movies
32:35 that's his big scene
32:37 he gets to come back as obi-wan obi-wan
32:40 Kenobi glowing you know why obi-wan
32:42 Kenobi's nowhere to be seen is kind of
32:44 strange isn't it obviously that
32:47 characters long past but he finds a way
32:51 to get along with the group that's
32:54 screwing him and then be extremely angry
32:56 at a guy that if he could get his way
32:58 would have returned America back to a
33:01 very positive 70s sort of you know post
33:05 Vietnam probably between like 76 and
33:09 maybe 88 where everything was just cool
33:11 all the back that the features came out
33:13 all the Star Wars all the Indiana
33:15 Jones's all those total recalls diehards
33:18 and terminators all came out I guarantee
33:22 he would have fared better had the group
33:26 that's against our President had not had
33:28 such a a run of fake collusion
33:32 accusations
33:34 he's faked dossiers all this crazy
33:37 darkness that's been injected in there
33:40 now I've been telling you guys that I've
33:42 been watching these videos at one point
33:46 I mentioned the kids name he's the guy
33:48 from New Zealand if you just look up New
33:51 Zealand Travel Channel guy or something
33:54 like that you'll find his channel
33:55 somewhere on YouTube but there's a
33:58 really nice guy who runs around and he
34:00 I'll probably put on the screen for you
34:03 but he runs around just traveling the
34:06 world and he's endorsed by various
34:09 travel agencies and other functions you
34:13 know sponsorships and what-have-you but
34:15 he's been to some very dangerous places
34:18 and what it shows you is the power of
34:23 censorship remember Marshall McLuhan
34:26 I've told you about him several times I
34:28 falsely said that he actually lived to
34:29 be almost 100 that was the other guy I
34:32 think um John Pollard was that was that
34:37 guy lived much longer I think Marshall
34:39 McLuhan only lived to be less than seven
34:42 years old but when it comes to
34:45 censorship I'm gonna repeat myself from
34:47 previous episodes but again we're
34:49 harvesting all this into ones
34:50 here he said medium is the message you
34:55 said it's more important that you
34:56 understand the the medium by which you
35:00 get your information as much as you
35:03 worry about the information that you get
35:06 and so what was he talking about
35:08 you know Marshall McLuhan got to see us
35:11 go out of radio into television of
35:14 course he understands that we went from
35:16 printing press to telegram up to radio
35:20 into television then to movies actually
35:24 movies preceded television of course and
35:27 I think he got a little bit of seeing
35:31 you know computer information going by
35:32 of course he was on the edge of all
35:35 things we know that television for
35:40 example operates at least 60 frames a
35:43 second all right
35:45 they tell you that you have to have 60
35:47 frames a second otherwise you can't see
35:48 animation on the screen well we know
35:51 that 60 frames a second strobed into the
35:54 human mind puts you in an alpha state of
35:56 the suggestibility when you go to the
35:59 movies for nearly a hundred years 24
36:01 frames a second was fine to see things
36:04 animate in the movie theater so what is
36:06 the TV need 36 more frames today's
36:11 standards 29.9 thing still missing 30
36:14 frames why can I see things animate in
36:17 the movie theater at half the frames
36:21 because when you're at home they got you
36:25 the beauty of censorship swelling in
36:30 2020 and kovat debuting in 2020 is that
36:34 you're now able to see how they're
36:36 trying to manipulate literally pop
36:39 science into your mind to believe things
36:43 and fear things that you don't have to
36:46 fear again
36:48 anybody who has you know again viruses
36:51 don't live outside the human body more
36:53 than a split-second if they're in a
36:54 spittle of your saliva they have a
36:57 little bit of an incubation point but I
37:00 think kovat is probably very sparse and
37:03 human body as it is since it's
37:04 two common cold anyway but if you did
37:07 have you know a handkerchief any of
37:10 these little cloth masks that you know
37:12 go over your ear if you don't have a
37:14 fully sealed in 95 mass that's fitted to
37:17 your face it mounted on your face in a
37:20 clean room where you have absolutely no
37:22 kovat or whatever the hell you're trying
37:24 to protect yourself from you can't break
37:26 the seal all day long if you break to
37:28 eat lunch you got to get a new mask and
37:31 a friend of mine said that he was
37:33 trained in him 95 masks and he said that
37:36 it's in 95 masks that you can wash up to
37:40 five times but if you really have a
37:43 virus any type of soap or water will
37:46 definitely kill it so that makes sense
37:48 to me you can wash them and dry your
37:49 mouth five times he's literally been
37:50 trained in that he just told me that two
37:53 feet from where I'm sitting right now
37:54 two days ago but outside of that one
37:59 nest supposed to wear a mask all day
38:01 long because you're breathing your own
38:02 co2 if you had a balanced pH so it's
38:04 gonna keep you nice and healthy and you
38:06 sit with a mask on even just a crappy
38:09 cloth one you're going to rack your pH
38:11 well guess what now you catch everything
38:14 you catch the common cold catch a
38:16 bacterial infection bronchitis or
38:19 something if you had pre-existing
38:21 conditions you are now going to be in
38:23 the most unhealthy state your body can
38:25 possibly be in it's interesting how you
38:29 know two years ago well outside the
38:32 envelope of this current event getting
38:34 medical science was actually fairly easy
38:37 today is nearly impossible herd immunity
38:42 60 percent of your population if exposed
38:46 to all things will keep the rest of the
38:48 population stable you'll get exposed
38:52 everything you build up antibodies
38:53 naturally you'll get Kovac and you'll
38:56 survive you get it when you're young
38:58 before you have a bunch of pre-existing
38:59 conditions it could kill you again you
39:05 should follow whatever makes you feel
39:07 comfortable because stress and itself
39:09 can mess up your body and your immune
39:11 system so if you're sitting there
39:13 terrified at home I'll do what you can
39:15 but if you're driving around in your car
39:16 well
39:17 masks on you don't get it the only thing
39:20 you could possibly do be doing aside
39:23 from being completely ignorant of
39:24 science is virtru signaling to everyone
39:27 outside your car that you've really just
39:29 got it all you're a good person and
39:31 they're bad right but they've now
39:34 launched this sort of you know this
39:37 multi-phase process of bringing a state
39:40 or a country back online
39:42 all with I mean it there's probably some
39:45 great things in there I haven't read but
39:48 social distancing bad idea
39:50 kills here at immunity wearing a mask
39:52 that's not fitted to your face and you
39:55 don't have pre-existing conditions
39:56 you're in that point O 2% chance of
39:59 dying of it right well then what are you
40:02 doing what are you doing
40:04 because influenza is way hard Annette
40:06 and we never worn masks we never
40:08 destroyed the economy would never
40:10 destroyed so many small businesses in
40:11 world history than we have in 2020 we
40:16 destroyed careers we've destroyed
40:18 moments now at the same time I can
40:22 definitely vouch that I have become
40:24 closer with some really good friends of
40:27 mine and it's a beautiful thing so you
40:31 know we have to figure out a way to
40:33 recover financially you know when your
40:35 state says you can't make money when
40:38 your state says your employer can't even
40:40 open their doors and you know there's
40:42 this facade that everyone can work from
40:44 home about major corporations and that's
40:46 simply not true you have to have human
40:49 beings in the same room I think for them
40:52 way more than 50 percent of the time for
40:54 us to actually function and not everyone
40:58 is you know up on zooming everything and
41:01 chatting everything and there's that old
41:04 law of reality which is out of sight out
41:06 of mind just doesn't work that's why we
41:10 have buildings that's why we get
41:11 together that's why we do what we do
41:14 censorship has you know a massive impact
41:18 on the human mind
41:23 you know the sort of low-hanging
41:27 problems that it creates for us is we
41:29 can't get information that's accurate
41:31 about our world and supposedly we're in
41:34 a crisis situation in corporations but
41:38 have no business getting into what we
41:41 see right
41:43 our gagging you from getting potentially
41:46 life-saving information the hack the
41:49 fact that hydrochloric one is being used
41:51 all over the world and where it's being
41:54 openly used they're having 100%
41:56 recoveries from everything again I got a
41:59 really close friend of mine whose wife
42:00 took that she has lupus and she took it
42:02 for 30 years people 30 years if there's
42:06 any side effect this woman has already a
42:08 compromised system with pre-existing
42:09 conditions it was only after 30 years of
42:13 taking hydrochloric went that they said
42:16 you got to be careful because your your
42:18 kidneys are really weak and you are
42:19 adjusting you know something that is
42:23 fighting fighting off infection and it
42:27 can get to a point where it stresses
42:29 when it processes out of your body it's
42:32 going throw the tubes in your kidneys
42:33 and it can stress your kidney which has
42:35 already got an issue but if you don't
42:36 have a kidney issue if you don't have a
42:39 pre-existing condition it seems as if
42:42 these countries are just clearing out
42:44 was a Tanzanian
42:45 open again Tanzanian president you know
42:48 said sent me some kovat test kits and he
42:51 tested on a goat and a fruit like a
42:53 mango I think or something all right no
42:56 it wasn't a mango I forgot it was it
42:59 just a positive okay so you know he's
43:03 banned masks and he's brought his
43:04 country back online try and you know
43:06 Japan's going back home late
43:08 we recovered fairly quick and now China
43:11 is like oh gosh we have a second wave
43:12 over here what's interesting about my
43:16 position is I've got at least one person
43:18 on who's very close to me who lives over
43:21 there and so I get enough deets you know
43:25 and we're not you know this person he
43:28 lives
43:29 very close he lives in the neighboring
43:31 town to one of the earliest towns that
43:33 has been supposedly reported as the
43:35 second wave so he has access to tons of
43:37 people he's not seeing this I'm this
43:39 love you live over there too I believe
43:41 and we'd be interesting to hear what
43:44 you're hearing but what's the other big
43:47 psychological damage that's created by
43:50 censorship well outside of misleading
43:54 you into your own demise by demonizing
43:59 treatments that will be a hundred
44:01 percent effective for your illness and
44:03 keep you from dying
44:04 I mean that's heresy isn't it let's say
44:09 you're not like us you're taking a blue
44:10 pill every day and all of a sudden every
44:14 piece of information that you get is
44:15 actually not only censored but what
44:20 makes it through the filter of the
44:22 censorship is a lie mmm
44:26 now you're setting up in your mind all
44:31 of the cause and effect models in your
44:33 mind are completely wrong you think
44:35 something's going to cause you to die
44:37 something is going to cause you to get
44:39 sick someone walking by you without a
44:41 mask is gonna instantaneously infect you
44:43 so now you're getting super stressed out
44:46 you're hiding in your house people very
44:50 close to me who bought this hook line &
44:52 sinker
44:53 and they got to almost suicidal levels
44:58 and these individuals don't watch the
45:00 show but they almost got the suicidal
45:02 levels gotten to panic-stricken modes
45:05 one person I know has hadn't been
45:08 drinking for years isn't recovering
45:11 alcoholic went on binge drinking and he
45:14 managed to hide it from their spouse for
45:17 weeks and I think we can probably deduce
45:20 quite scientifically all based on lies
45:23 what if this person hadn't made it what
45:26 if this person drank themselves toxic
45:28 and died what if this person decided to
45:31 kill themselves
45:32 all because of censorship they weren't
45:35 allowed to freely look up information
45:38 and create their own opinion about
45:40 things let's say that you're a good stet
45:43 ition you're a good logistics person
45:46 you're a good debater you can really
45:49 think things through beautifully you're
45:52 a genius let's just say that much right
45:55 okay but if all the information you have
45:58 in your mind is crap but all those
46:02 talents go to waste and the more that
46:05 you carry those falsehoods forward and
46:08 you're having conversations with people
46:10 and you're attempting to quote-unquote
46:12 help somebody but every piece of
46:14 information you hand over is going to
46:17 compromise their immune system can
46:19 accomplish their health you're going to
46:21 get them perhaps addicted to news
46:24 sources that are absolutely erroneous
46:26 super censored super propagandized and
46:32 they've neutralized that individual to
46:35 be essentially an agent of evil without
46:37 them even knowing it and the thing is if
46:41 you would actually look through the
46:43 magic mirror at them and see what they
46:45 actually look like in their reflection
46:46 they're actually a good person inside
46:48 they're really trying to do the best
46:49 they're just super gullible because
46:52 perhaps they've had a privileged life
46:54 no-one's ever screwed them over their
46:55 entire life until right now and so they
46:59 can't imagine anyone telling them a lie
47:00 I have a friend of mine who is diving
47:04 super duper deep into the ups teen thing
47:05 falling out on a daily basis trying to
47:08 watch every single special that comes
47:11 out from all around the world from
47:13 television shows trying to get them you
47:16 know translated so they can read about
47:18 who's where what when all this other
47:20 stuff and what she has come up with is
47:24 that you know she's keeping a count of
47:28 all the women that have come forth which
47:32 are a lot of women and we are
47:35 effectively showing them today at least
47:38 as of the current mass arrests or the
47:42 lack thereof
47:43 that there is no justice you can get
47:48 trafficked you can get raped a million
47:51 times forced to sleep with royal family
47:53 members like Prince Andrew and there's
47:57 no justice whatsoever there's a
48:00 different grade of person they're better
48:02 than you and they have the right to rape
48:03 you
48:04 well what's really really strange about
48:07 it is that the group that tells you that
48:09 they're all for the feminine movement
48:11 and they're gonna protect you and all
48:13 your rights they seem to be completely
48:16 absent and that's what's frustrating my
48:18 friend she's saying where are all these
48:20 activists that always march outside of
48:23 you know the various organizations that
48:26 don't believe what they believe they
48:28 have all this time and energy to get
48:31 organized to do basically ineffective
48:34 protests but never helping a victim who
48:40 is literally a victim of the things that
48:41 they say that they can't possibly allow
48:43 on this planet hmm I think the answer to
48:50 why that's occurring is what I just told
48:53 you when all of the information you take
48:55 inside your mind is all pre censored
48:58 meaning you have triggers in your system
49:01 Pavlo nyan triggers in your system that
49:02 will that will rile you up and get you
49:05 to defend something right remember the
49:06 stories I told you when I was sitting
49:08 just kind of sound funny but you know it
49:12 was Eagle Claw kung fu out of San
49:14 Francisco the teacher said to this woman
49:20 it was our first day and had this big
49:23 dude in that room and he told her he
49:28 goes you can do anything as guy you want
49:30 just don't poke him in the eyes and he
49:34 had her come at her and and she just
49:36 absolutely crumbled I mean he was so
49:39 formidable gigantic she just couldn't
49:41 even conceive of hitting the guy back
49:44 and so he said okay you you literally
49:47 got an A for what you just did because
49:49 it needed needed you to demonstrate that
49:52 that's how we all behave in a default
49:54 situation but he says let me wake up
49:57 triggering you he said gee how many kids
50:00 and she said yes I got two kids he says
50:02 do you have any nieces or nephews oh yes
50:05 I got a bunch of them it was a Chinese
50:09 woman and he was Chinese of course and
50:12 he goes ok I want you to imagine now
50:14 resets the guy back to the southern room
50:16 he goes I want you to imagine he was
50:19 explained to me what your kids look like
50:20 and so she started you know how old also
50:24 about this I about that hi ok let's just
50:25 imagine he he literally painted in her
50:28 mind the ghosts of these kids in the
50:30 room and now he said okay here's what's
50:34 gonna really take place in this scenario
50:36 and he did it beautifully where he
50:38 locked her minded to this he didn't let
50:40 any of us talk or anything and so here
50:42 comes his dude he says he's coming after
50:46 your kids he doesn't care about you he's
50:48 gonna snatch one of your kids and walk
50:50 off remember how you just cowbird down
50:52 you didn't even do anything well down I
50:55 want you to imagine he's got your
50:56 daughter you're young as thing she had
50:58 like a three or four year old he's got
50:59 her in his arm he's gonna do whatever he
51:01 wants with her and oh my god is dude
51:05 walk towards her it was you know kind of
51:12 silly but you know she went for a kick
51:14 in his crotch and and did some of the
51:17 other things he just recently showed us
51:18 and it triggered her because why she had
51:22 different perspectives she had little
51:23 information she had more context but
51:26 what if all that was censored away from
51:28 her and in addition to not bringing up
51:33 that trigger for her the mass media that
51:37 we have today says you're weak you're a
51:41 woman you can't do anything training
51:45 what's training you're not to get any
51:47 training you're just to remain weak
51:50 because these politicians these royal
51:54 family members these corporate heads
51:56 they get to pick and choose from your
51:59 children all of you people out there
52:01 that post your little kids up there on
52:03 social media I've been telling people
52:05 this for 10 years before this show ever
52:08 use it existed I said stop hosting
52:11 like your little vulnerable kids men
52:13 because you're posting a catalog that
52:16 they get to shop from because I don't
52:18 care where you live in this world if
52:22 they want your kid they will get your
52:24 kid and that's the game I want to have
52:27 sex with here at that little girl right
52:29 there
52:29 make it happen here's I got infinite
52:31 money go ahead and make it happen we've
52:35 identified for sure and I'm gonna call
52:38 out some og folks that have been trying
52:39 to do this for decades but at least for
52:42 the last three years through at least
52:43 the q-and-a movement there he's fake or
52:46 real doesn't matter people have
52:47 uncovered the fact we've got a huge
52:49 human trafficking problem we've
52:52 uncovered statistics like a hundred
52:54 thousand people or kids excuse me
52:56 seventeen or below disappear in the
52:58 United States of America alone per year
53:02 800,000 adjusted for kids that could run
53:06 away which are 12 and up you still have
53:09 over 50% of those kids we tell me a
53:12 3-year olds on the street yeah not
53:15 likely
53:15 kidnapped sold harvested whatever
53:20 they're doing to these kids it's
53:22 happening in droves what you would think
53:25 that if we've uncovered an epidemic of
53:27 this did the mass media if they cared
53:30 about you whatsoever would be focusing
53:33 your attention on mechanisms by which we
53:36 could protect our children analyze our
53:39 neighborhoods to make sure we don't have
53:41 these predators running around you know
53:44 just getting to know your neighbors
53:45 alone is a great method of figuring out
53:47 what's going on Venezuela Brazil
53:52 probably at least half a dozen countries
53:54 in Africa a few countries in the Middle
53:58 East they've all taught us what it looks
54:01 like to have a censored world and you
54:06 have to always equate censorship this
54:10 raw kind of censorship where it's normal
54:13 information getting censored it's really
54:16 equating to you saying I'm losing my
54:18 rights
54:19 I'm losing my rights right we have now
54:24 had over the last four weeks the CDC has
54:30 quietly rejected virtually everything
54:34 that they ever said their predictions
54:36 have all been rejected because they
54:37 didn't happen all the methods to keep
54:39 you safe have been rejected masks have
54:42 literally been deemed incapable in most
54:46 cases protecting you against the virus
54:48 even if someone's like right on your
54:49 mouth like you're kissing and you both
54:51 have masks on your breathing in each
54:52 other
54:52 because that's about as close as you'd
54:54 have to be to get a live virus out of
54:57 your mouth into someone else's mouth
54:59 they even said of the president
55:02 conference one day with Bochy in the
55:04 room that Burke's right behind him that
55:06 if you were to get it in your mouth and
55:07 you can swallow it your saliva and your
55:11 digestive acids in your stomach will
55:14 shred it to pieces so why would you ever
55:17 wear one why would you ever wear one
55:21 again if you're in a point Oh 2% chance
55:24 of dying of something can if you're
55:27 older and your doctor says look you get
55:30 this you might die it's a whole
55:32 different game you need to get the
55:33 fitted mask you need to really kind of
55:34 stay away from folks you can still go
55:36 outside just don't get around people you
55:39 know be careful but there sure seems
55:42 like there's a lot of wag the dog going
55:44 on right now we have a guy running for
55:46 president of the Democratic ticket who
55:49 is in the literally the freefall of
55:51 dementia he is like if he was your
55:56 grandfather or your father for instance
55:58 and your friends were to ask you how's
56:00 your dad doing you would literally be in
56:03 that stage where most of you known
56:05 someone like this if you have an art
56:07 experienced it yourself and you just
56:08 can't well and he has good days and he
56:10 has bad days but he mostly has bad days
56:13 he really has a bad train of thought
56:17 he can't remember anything he literally
56:20 can't remember anything he can't
56:22 remember who was running against he says
56:24 he's running against himself half the
56:25 time you know he missed quotes a bunch
56:28 of stuff statistics just go into the
56:30 trillions you know it's like he'll say
56:32 we've lost
56:33 billion people in the United States you
56:35 know I mean he's just nuts he's in that
56:38 free fall liberal press gets him in an
56:41 interview and asks and ridiculous
56:44 softball questions that almost doesn't
56:46 matter if he even answers the question
56:48 and this is being offered to you as a
56:51 candidate in the United States of
56:52 America as a potential leader of the
56:56 free world with the biggest standing
56:58 army in the entire planet Russia's not
57:01 too far behind this of course but I'm
57:03 just saying that's a lot of power for a
57:06 guy who doesn't have the ability to
57:08 remember where he is what's the subject
57:12 that you just asked him even given cue
57:15 cards this guy cannot read them to you
57:17 and maintain a thought his brain is
57:20 short-circuiting now we're all
57:23 anticipating a replacement before they
57:25 take it in right they're trying to use
57:28 this kovat to do several different
57:29 things to you one erode your
57:31 constitutional rights permanently and
57:33 agenda twenty one thing two they want to
57:37 vaccinate you with some Bill Gates
57:39 vaccination though cases are neat oldies
57:41 trying to reduce rural population the
57:43 whole world ten is fifteen percent is
57:46 twenty ten TED talk ok well there's no
57:49 methodology suggested by modern science
57:52 where a vaccination reduces world
57:53 population it would have to give you an
57:55 epiphany in your mind of not having as
57:58 many children as you might want to have
58:00 through some you know again some neo
58:03 kung-fu learning thing or you just get
58:04 jacked in the back of your brain and
58:06 boom you got a career in mine instead of
58:08 being a parent for six kids you know
58:11 they want to put a chip in your body
58:14 just so you have a little ID thing
58:17 inside you then they got you got you in
58:20 the computer well again the ticket says
58:24 well if the last three and a half years
58:26 the whole thing is that the liberal
58:30 party has said that you know that the
58:31 conservative party was going to start a
58:33 bunch of wars that never happened
58:35 plenty of opportunity but it never
58:37 happened but every single time Trump
58:40 tries to take troops out of the Middle
58:42 East or any other place in the world
58:44 that Liberal Party protests and tries to
58:47 stop him from taking those troops out
58:50 but they're supposed to be the Nobel
58:53 Peace Prize party right these are things
58:56 you have to pay attention to they're
58:58 going to affect your world they're going
59:00 to affect what you know as reality
59:02 they're going to turn any modern country
59:06 in the planet into a Venezuela into a
59:09 Brazil and remember dial back to the
59:13 Wayback Machine just ten years ago ten
59:17 years ago Venezuela and Brazil were
59:20 doing just fine and within ten years
59:23 much less than that they turned the
59:25 place upside down so naive Americans
59:30 think oh that could never happened here
59:32 oh really now I guarantee you could
59:35 happen here and it's already started in
59:37 censorship is one of the key mechanisms
59:40 used by all dictators all socialistic
59:44 dictators controlled information how
59:49 many of you heard a story where someone
59:50 is taken away in the middle of the night
59:52 and North Korea Kim Jong is a bad
59:54 dictator because he takes people who
59:56 protest against the state and he puts
59:58 them in those concentration camps if he
59:59 doesn't kill him on sight China China
60:02 does it to the other only fully 100% Tom
60:06 Yunus the country on planet earth like
60:08 everyone's tried it everyone says this
60:09 doesn't work and they're still sucking
60:10 on that tit you know well China you get
60:14 thrown out thrown in prison and then you
60:16 get your organs harvest randomly one day
60:18 aka killed okay what's the censorship
60:24 doing it's trying to keep China 100%
60:27 approved in the people's eyes we like
60:31 the fact that there's you know slave
60:34 labor over there we like the fact that
60:35 there's organ harvesting over there we
60:38 like the fact that their country lies
60:40 24/7 every time they open their mouth we
60:43 like that it's awesome right and how is
60:46 it that all of these organizations that
60:49 control social media
60:51 have all basically turned against the
60:54 country turns it against the
60:56 constitutional rights merit wasn't it
60:58 DARPA
60:58 they canceled a project the day that
61:02 Facebook went live and that project was
61:05 all about creating a facial recognition
61:07 social media system
61:10 what's the replacement called face book
61:13 a book of faces and all these things
61:17 that these suckers fall for man what
61:20 would you look like 20 years from now
61:22 right and you use their app and then
61:24 they learn how your face would age right
61:25 and then they kind of got you right yeah
61:28 the truth of story is is that once they
61:30 have one photograph of you they can run
61:33 that app themselves they don't need you
61:34 to help them but they want what they're
61:37 doing is running big machine algorithms
61:39 on every single photo you put of
61:41 yourself online figuring out how it
61:43 changes and it's getting SuperDuper
61:48 smart I was watching a blender
61:51 conference by the blender guru guy at
61:53 the blender org summit they had I think
61:57 it was about three years ago 2017 and he
62:00 showed a collage actually not just like
62:03 a yearbook sort of page with I don't
62:05 know a couple dozen faces on it and he
62:09 was trying to show you this machine
62:11 learning methodology of creating assets
62:15 in 3d and he goes every single face you
62:17 see up here and they look great they
62:18 look absolutely fantastic fully really
62:21 because these that people aren't real
62:23 all this has been created by harvesting
62:26 celebrity eye sockets and faces and
62:28 mouths and shapes and hairs my god he
62:30 was perfect and maybe they create more
62:33 crap than they create good but I'll have
62:35 to do is filter it out now one of the
62:37 exercises this I think fairly valuable
62:39 for your mind although it could be
62:41 fairly tormenting and this is really for
62:43 red pill people only especially if
62:46 you've read brave new world by Huxley
62:49 which I believe is like 1937 somewhere
62:52 in there imagine that they win you don't
63:00 put your skin in the game you've never
63:02 raised the issue because you're afraid
63:04 of being unpopular
63:05 with your friends or whatever it's not
63:07 red PLP people do but I'm just really
63:09 talking about the folks they sort of sit
63:12 on the fence forever right
63:15 the way that you parse this in your mind
63:17 is the following every single thing that
63:21 we're catching them do right now the
63:23 Adreno chrome stuff the child
63:26 trafficking human trafficking every
63:30 single dark thing that you have ever
63:32 heard in your life
63:33 it's illegal today but if they win it'll
63:39 be legal if Rosa Corey's concerns that
63:44 she is the she is the utter world expert
63:48 on agenda 21 in terms of being in
63:51 nefarious projects right you take
63:56 everything that she's been warning us
63:57 about for 15 years and you let that
63:59 become true 97% of the world's
64:03 population gone of the 3 to 1 percent
64:07 that's left but you know where they
64:09 start the number from hmm might be a lot
64:14 different when you have a kid could be
64:16 you have a kid and they're taken away
64:19 from you right away and they just become
64:22 toys for people any of us that think for
64:25 ourselves our DNA would be wiped out if
64:29 we weren't them and I'm willing to bet
64:32 you know the interesting thing is is um
64:35 there have been countless situations in
64:37 the world I've heard in personal
64:39 scenarios and then some of those like
64:42 old gangster stories I met a guy in Las
64:47 Vegas once who
64:48 boy a man as he was he full of a bunch
64:50 of stories very I met with him several
64:53 nights in a row amazing guy they said
64:58 they're one of the patterns that these
65:00 nefarious people never realized because
65:03 they are so stupid that their
65:05 fundamental core levels are so stupid
65:09 let's take n a shill like Adam Schiff
65:13 Nadler Pelosi Schumer all these people
65:17 everyone involved with the
65:19 other situation including Mueller
65:21 himself there's a romantic sort of
65:25 Hollywood thing that says you stay loyal
65:29 to the Godfather and then he keeps you
65:31 close as long as he's got things that he
65:35 needs done that you do and Godfather
65:38 romantic you know
65:41 Scarface kind of storyline I see
65:43 romantic you know what I'm talking about
65:45 drama based story maybe you're moving
65:48 drugs for them maybe you're moving
65:49 people for them kids for them maybe
65:51 you're killing people for him and these
65:54 individuals who do this they think
65:58 inside their brain I am extra protected
66:01 I am the most loyal right hand or left
66:05 hand of so-and-so way up above when the
66:11 game is finished any maneuver for power
66:13 is finished the competition has been
66:16 eliminated
66:17 there have been countless situations and
66:20 you ask anyone who's ever spent any time
66:21 in prison they'll tell you this right to
66:23 your face there's no loyalty among
66:26 thieves what ends up occurring is that
66:30 these individuals get slaughtered
66:32 because the people at the top are
66:35 paranoid right that whole Castro
66:38 paranoia thing was a Columbo did this
66:40 amazing Castro Twilight Zone where he
66:43 became insanely paranoid this is a
66:45 classic art that has really occurred
66:48 across time all time every King every
66:51 Queen every general has gone through
66:53 this at least I'm sorry every country
66:55 that's ever had these people have had
66:57 one personal he's go free freaky and
67:00 they start killing all of the underlings
67:03 because they say to themselves the
67:05 following phrase if you were willing to
67:08 spite your own kind to help me then
67:11 you're a piece of [ __ ] and then there's
67:13 just a matter of time before you're
67:14 gonna kill me to get all my stuff and so
67:18 I'll kill you first so this has happened
67:21 several times in history it is my
67:25 destination that with all of the robot
67:27 technology that's being rapidly
67:29 developed at a Boston Dynamics
67:32 that the one group that these pedophile
67:38 ridden ruling class individuals will
67:42 trust as a fleet of robots they tell us
67:46 everything that we can do and everything
67:48 that we can't do you will be bred out of
67:52 your ability to have empathetic maternal
67:55 feelings for your kids if they can do it
67:58 they'll try to do it no I don't honestly
68:00 think that's very easy but boy they'll
68:03 try it you have been told several times
68:07 that when you are a voting citizen you
68:11 are sheep when you are a soldier they
68:15 think of you as cattle right so either
68:18 way both animals are led to the
68:20 slaughter right don't think for a second
68:26 that letting them get their way is ever
68:29 going to turn out to be anything other
68:30 than pretty much hell on earth and
68:33 that's not an exaggeration to make you
68:35 go my way most of you have been
68:40 confronted with the decision about
68:44 getting a forced vaccination for this
68:48 kovat situation that's why all the
68:49 liberal states in the United States are
68:51 trying to lock down their people for as
68:53 long as they possibly can now there
68:57 luckily reporting out of Britain that
68:59 the amount of people with kovat is
69:02 starting to vanish so quickly that
69:05 they're not gonna have enough people to
69:07 conduct a thorough trial I think there's
69:11 one vaccination they're trying in
69:12 England and they're basically saying
69:14 it's got a 50/50 chance of actually
69:16 producing antibodies in your body oh
69:18 great
69:20 and these poor people who are just
69:23 ignorant of what the vaccination has in
69:26 it no they're gonna go back what if
69:29 you're in the 50% that doesn't go back
69:31 you just got mercury aluminum and
69:33 formaldehyde in your system among a
69:35 bunch of other toxins and detergents in
69:37 your body of course and then you're
69:39 gonna go back for a second round because
69:41 it didn't work the first time oh here's
69:43 your hundred dollars
69:44 I'm let's
69:45 a thousand bucks to test out a
69:47 vaccination thousand bucks
69:50 yes that's nothing a thousand pounds
69:51 pound sterling
69:53 right thousand euros he could get
69:55 something done with that kind of money
69:57 no matter where you live you can do
69:58 something with that but they're buying
70:01 your brain away from you right there's
70:04 the funny scene in Hitchhiker's Guide of
70:06 the galaxy where these mice that in the
70:10 story ran planet Earth one - by Arthur
70:14 dense brain because it might have the
70:16 question of life the universe and
70:17 everything in it and they're trying to
70:19 buy his brain off of them and it's right
70:23 in your face right of course he's not
70:24 gonna sell his brain he you know and
70:26 Zaphod is like oh don't worry about it
70:28 we'll just get your real simple brain
70:29 that just says what and so think about
70:33 getting tea or something like that right
70:34 a few my friends have said this to my
70:38 friends have actually said this in
70:39 different conversations and I don't
70:41 believe they've talked to each other but
70:44 they said something really profound
70:45 which is that in in previous Wars that
70:48 we have fought at least we could look
70:51 across the battlefield and see them
70:53 wearing the other country's flag the red
70:58 cloak red coats the Nazis the whatever's
71:01 week at least see them and go there they
71:03 are
71:03 maybe we lose maybe we win but there
71:06 they are today it's a stealth war and
71:11 it's coming at you from so many
71:14 different angles it's daunting isn't it
71:18 trying to get decent information about a
71:20 particular event it's starting to rip a
71:22 country apart
71:23 mmm that's rough you're seeing them in
71:26 the United States of America try to
71:27 start one of the one of the most classic
71:31 methods of voter fraud that we have had
71:34 to deal with every single time we've had
71:36 an election and they try to make you
71:38 believe that because the military votes
71:41 by mail that's the same exact thing as
71:44 the citizens voting by mail it's a
71:46 completely different pipeline okay army
71:50 votes are counted and delivered very
71:53 strategically and they're protected by
71:55 the army they get counted they get you
71:58 know there's probably a little bit of
71:59 fraud but
71:59 much but all residential mailings have
72:03 always been used by the Democrats to
72:04 have hundreds of thousands of people
72:08 vote who are dead people vote six or
72:11 seven times they use it to throw the
72:15 election every single time you know I
72:18 mentioned Pelosi in San Francisco
72:20 everybody knows San Francisco screwed
72:22 San Francisco in terms of first world
72:25 country status cities a nice to live up
72:31 near Sur Francisco for 12 years it has
72:33 been bad for a very very long time I
72:35 never put the two together
72:37 who was your senator in this area you
72:39 know she's been a senator there there
72:41 since 1993 I got there 91 straight
72:45 decent 91 San Francisco was pretty cool
72:48 at the time I left in 2002 it was
72:51 atrocious and I immediately got my
72:52 clients there from LA so I'd fly up to
72:55 visit my clients and it was in a
72:57 cascading fall of homelessness and
73:01 outrageous rent prices and all kinds of
73:04 stuff I mean it's just getting gutted up
73:06 there
73:07 well now you're telling me that everyone
73:10 who's in that group continually votes
73:14 for Nancy Pelosi really go into the
73:17 voting booth you got options you got
73:20 options when you you know there's other
73:22 Democrats running against her why not
73:23 just switch boats at least one time
73:25 maybe you switch and it gets even worse
73:27 and then you switch back but why not
73:30 jump ship and go ahead and try someone
73:32 who's red just see right when I got here
73:34 in California well friend of mine told
73:37 me he was Armenian the governor whose
73:40 name is really difficult to say in 1987
73:42 in California buddy of mine he was just
73:45 out here the other day talking about the
73:46 mast certification he grew up here he
73:49 grew up in Garden Grove he's 53 years
73:51 old he saw the whole the whole thing 53
73:54 years of California development he said
73:56 look that governor in 87 was the best
73:58 governor that he's ever seen run
74:01 California when I told you I got here in
74:03 87 this place was euphoric any of you
74:07 who have ever seen California on the
74:09 movies back in the 80s and you thought
74:10 man and we really fun to live there all
74:13 the rock and roll
74:14 bans all the art and all the crazy
74:16 Malibu beach parties that were you know
74:18 and there was some funky stuff going on
74:20 but there's a lot of good stuff going on
74:22 as well that's exactly the way this day
74:25 was and he said I mean I was at least in
74:29 LA okay
74:30 San Francisco so if our value was
74:35 exploding all these legendary companies
74:37 we have today well they cut their teeth
74:39 in the late 80s right she had Apple with
74:42 her bunch of transitions they were
74:43 really really early look at Intel sunk
74:46 their teeth in that place now they're
74:47 the standard processor of the world that
74:50 all happened during these watches how is
74:54 it that a vote is thrown and the people
74:58 believe it the people don't suspected
75:01 the vote was thrown but it was through
75:03 because of censorship and propaganda and
75:08 by the way I had it reported to me I
75:13 think I just believed a little phrase
75:16 out that was incorrect because of the
75:19 1950 show called clue I think it's
75:22 what's called right I believe that was
75:25 the name of it was a a show where you
75:27 had to guess certain things and they
75:28 found out later that the show was fixed
75:31 and it really was a huge thing for
75:33 America they passed a law that says the
75:38 propaganda and lying cannot be broadcast
75:40 on TV and then somebody told me that
75:44 Obama actually turned it back that it
75:46 was turned off during Bush's
75:48 administration that was turned back on
75:49 during Obama's administration and I just
75:52 read a whole report the other day that
75:53 it was actually turned off during
75:55 Obama's administration again to put Papa
75:58 ganda on TV
75:59 known lies to sway opinion no I don't
76:04 know why Trump hasn't passed that again
76:06 you're the other way you kick a line
76:08 you're liable for damages defamation all
76:11 that stuff right now you still have
76:15 recourse in case someone says something
76:16 about you
76:18 but it should just be but if the other
76:21 49 states here that San Francisco voted
76:24 for Nancy Pelosi one more time the
76:28 propaganda and the mass media will let
76:30 you need let you know that that's
76:32 exactly the way that everyone voted that
76:34 San Francisco is a thousand percent blue
76:36 will never be anything other than blue
76:38 and I don't personally know you know
76:41 besides a god fact we all won't know
76:43 because people don't always say what
76:46 their beliefs are especially when
76:48 there's a tumultuous situation where
76:50 you're pressured not to like a guy that
76:52 may be improving the value of your 401 K
76:55 might be improving the funding to
76:59 streams of employment that otherwise
77:02 wouldn't be available without a strong
77:04 dollar without a strong stock market et
77:07 cetera right so you know it's it's um
77:13 I'm gonna give you that I got about you
77:15 know you just left on the stake here but
77:17 it's like one of these things where
77:19 there's the the twilight zone with
77:22 burgess meredith and there's another
77:25 twilight zone that has the archetype is
77:31 this is the trolley zone where these
77:32 this dual headed alien messes with the
77:37 electricity on a street and everyone
77:39 goes crazy on the street and even murder
77:43 a neighbor with a gun because you're so
77:47 paranoid and then the episode ends or
77:49 they talked these aliens and like well
77:51 just with a little bit of power change
77:53 in the neighborhood these people lost
77:54 their minds burgess meredith played a
77:58 role and it's named after the guy's name
78:00 a camera really episodes title but it's
78:02 about him getting his getting a strength
78:06 boost and he I just talked about to see
78:10 other day and my episodes but a little
78:12 teeny tiny change that you think would
78:14 be a positive can turn out to be a
78:17 profound negative and so letting a
78:22 little bit of censorship go by means you
78:24 really buy the whole farm you buy the
78:25 whole thing every repercussion of
78:27 censorship within a community within a
78:30 society
78:31 he goes to maximum level right away
78:34 there's no such thing as a little bit
78:36 pregnant right a little bit dead a
78:39 little bit terminally ill you know these
78:43 things are a hundred percent the the
78:47 depth of which this state that were in
78:52 in 2020 how do I put this the depth at
78:57 which we are being attacked mentally is
79:01 is this close to what they can conceive
79:06 as maximum as can be conceived and it's
79:10 being implemented I reported no no no
79:15 three or four episodes ago this
79:19 gentleman who's now circling sort of the
79:24 the interview track around the world and
79:27 he's a former transsexual and as far as
79:32 I understand he was more of a
79:33 crossdresser than a person who altered
79:35 his body in any way shape or form but he
79:39 is now seeing so many of his friends
79:41 commit suicide like dozens and dozens of
79:45 his friends he was probably in his 50s I
79:47 would guess but he has been through so
79:50 many of these funerals that now he's
79:52 saying look there's something wrong with
79:53 this whole thing he says there's a
79:57 strange phase that people do all of
80:01 these changes to their body if you're a
80:05 man they cut their junk off if they're a
80:08 woman they get forced breast removals
80:11 they take a bunch of drugs they grow a
80:15 lot of hair on their body
80:16 whatever they take their hair off
80:17 whatever it is they go the opposite
80:19 route but he has seen so much fatality
80:22 due to suicide
80:23 I can't I think it was like 28 times the
80:28 suicide rate among transsexuals who have
80:31 actually changed their gender right
80:33 reassignment surgery he's trying to get
80:36 people to not do it so quickly like give
80:39 it some thought before like spin some
80:42 decades I got a really close friend of
80:44 mine in high school
80:45 who was I think completed quite a bit of
80:49 the reassignment surgery but he's 50
80:53 he's 50 or more so he's had decades to
80:56 think about this I interviewed him once
80:58 and he was very forthcoming and I really
81:00 appreciate it he said you know because I
81:02 asked him I said because I knew him he
81:04 was like a very masculine guy very
81:06 good-looking dude he got married he had
81:08 his kids it's beautiful daughters two
81:09 beautiful daughters listen you know I've
81:12 known you for a long time I said um when
81:14 did you know and he told me he said
81:17 right away he just goes you know what
81:19 honestly I've always known I've always
81:23 known my whole life this wasn't me and
81:26 it was you know surprising to obviously
81:29 hear that but I know that he's a very
81:31 intelligent person and he's and he's
81:33 even had like a near-death experience
81:34 that he had a heart attack once and so
81:37 he seemed kind of old gamut of life so
81:40 when he does it for me you know I think
81:44 that it's like it's like thinking about
81:45 getting your first tattoo and you get it
81:47 at 50 but you were thinking about it for
81:49 30 years you want that tattoo yeah you
81:52 know you're probably gonna really like
81:53 the tattoo and you probably won't regret
81:55 it ever but I just got a call tonight
82:00 from a friend and she was telling me
82:02 that one of her associates from a
82:05 previous job has an 18 year old daughter
82:09 he just had her breasts removed and she
82:13 is going through the full system of
82:14 change and this is the exact demographic
82:19 that this guy is talking about now I
82:23 think most of my listeners are fairly
82:28 sophisticated individuals I've never met
82:30 anyone that wasn't sophisticated through
82:32 chat or through comments or what have
82:34 you on average that least two consistent
82:36 people that keep coming back and one
82:37 offs every once a while but I think most
82:42 of us know that 18 years old our
82:44 perception of forever doesn't exist we
82:49 don't know what it's like to do
82:51 something forever I got my first tattoo
82:55 at 23
82:56 it was religious Christianity based as
82:59 much as I have a complete respect for
83:01 the Christian religion and what it
83:02 teaches its moral base makes really good
83:05 people I decided that you know this
83:08 wasn't really where I put my belief
83:11 system and thankfully kind of distorted
83:12 a little bit so I tattooed something on
83:15 top and touches something on top of that
83:17 one and it turned out really nice it's
83:18 really great but even in twenty three
83:21 with a bunch of really intense
83:25 accomplishments under my belt I was a
83:27 super professional at 18 you know I was
83:30 doing stuff I was side by side with
83:32 adults everyone thought my classroom for
83:33 my school was my college ring I mean you
83:35 know I carried myself mentally at a
83:40 point where other adults couldn't figure
83:42 out how old I was I mean they thought I
83:43 was 24 or so and I was laying a team
83:46 amount of pimples on my face should have
83:49 given them a clue so we're not supposed
83:52 to say anything against that you know
83:53 we're not supposed to say even that we
83:55 have a concern about how our society is
83:58 being changed but I can't possibly erase
84:04 the notion that I will believe for the
84:07 rest of my life that that eighteen year
84:09 old girl who is now becoming a man have
84:12 we kept her away from social media kept
84:16 her away from all the news all of the
84:20 pressures to do something to be cool
84:22 right to be unique maybe they wouldn't
84:27 have made that decision so early
84:31 do I believe people are born and feel
84:34 like they're another in the wrong sex
84:36 absolutely complaining of friends that
84:37 have that feeling they haven't made any
84:38 physical changes to themselves but
84:40 that's how they feel one of my friends
84:43 is one of those beautiful females you'll
84:45 ever meet and she tell me to my face
84:48 it's kind of like Deep Space 9 with it
84:55 was the actress Terry Farrell played
84:57 acts and she was playing a symbionts
85:00 where she would have a little kernel of
85:03 a personality literally physically put
85:06 inside of her body and she was the she
85:09 was a guy in the previous life right so
85:10 the whole show she's talking about
85:12 having been this the effect was a
85:15 Benjamin Sisko would call her old man
85:16 because he was friends with the previous
85:18 being that she was you know at least
85:20 that this little little nugget inside of
85:22 her was right I talked to my friend and
85:26 she goes you know and I'm I just want
85:28 you to know if she goes I pretty much
85:31 feel like I'm a I'm a black man she does
85:33 that's just what I feel like I am and
85:36 she's like an Italian stink Tzadik
85:41 looking woman so it's just really
85:42 interesting it's very much like I'm in
85:44 German Sisco and she's Dax right and so
85:47 it happens but she is but I love my
85:49 femininity I love Who I look what I look
85:50 like and she takes real good care of
85:52 herself and so that happens but now
85:58 let's say you were the parents and I got
86:01 a buddy of mine who's dealing with this
86:02 right now and he loves his daughter and
86:04 you know he's just 100 percent support
86:07 sure what kind of what else could you
86:08 possibly do right but you know it's one
86:11 of these things if you were the parent
86:13 and sometimes these people get married
86:15 to and their spouse is the opposite sex
86:17 and and it starts to happen during the
86:19 relationship and you're like hey I want
86:20 to be married to a dude what are you
86:21 doing right but it's one of these
86:24 situations where you want to remove all
86:27 of this influence and then if it occurs
86:30 we're all much more on board we're all
86:33 you know look you weren't influenced by
86:34 anybody this was a hundred percent you
86:36 looking in the mirror like my buddy
86:37 right and you know I really think my bud
86:42 you made the decision himself I mean
86:45 this is a fairly recent thing of maybe
86:46 last I'd say five years he's been making
86:50 these changes I think about the balls it
86:52 takes to do this man because you just
86:54 worry about what society's gonna think
86:57 we cannot allow truth in this world or
87:01 the option of an untruth the option to
87:07 be censored out of our view it just so
87:12 happens that when we find things that
87:15 are conclusive we're not allowed to
87:18 believe them there are some serious
87:21 problems with our society for instance
87:24 if I were to call this show something
87:26 something 9/11 Google is gonna put
87:29 underneath the video a link off to the
87:33 official story of 9/11 to make sure that
87:35 whatever I tell you is deprecated if you
87:37 happen to believe the link down below
87:40 physics defies that day it simply does
87:45 there's a ton of dis info out there the
87:47 physics defies the official story
87:48 nothing you can do about physics it is
87:52 what it is we can test physics in a
87:54 laboratory you can text physics in your
87:56 living room we could does it right here
87:58 on I can take a pencil crack it and we
88:00 can talk about tension that I'm putting
88:01 on this wood with a little you know it's
88:05 not LED but the carbon inside of it
88:06 right you can figure all that stuff out
88:08 when it's gonna crack well then I can
88:09 crack it it's all figured out but you're
88:12 not allowed to believe the truth with
88:15 this kovat thing we have so much pop
88:17 science going around to create fear and
88:20 uncertainty to get a vaccination in your
88:23 body with a chip and a tattoo what world
88:26 do you want to live in man what world do
88:28 you want to live in because there is no
88:30 such thing anymore in 2020 of me telling
88:33 you that some point in the future all
88:35 this is going to come down it has always
88:38 been on top of us but right now it is on
88:41 top of us at a level that is it's is
88:44 we're well inside the envelope of their
88:46 go time of their go plan what does it
88:50 come down to though
88:52 honestly it comes down to all of us
88:54 becoming informed trying to get every
88:57 single citizen it's not a politician a
88:59 corporate person pedo trafficker drug
89:02 person get every one red pill did you
89:05 possibly can
89:07 what we want is a society whereby when a
89:10 crime is committed it sticks out like a
89:13 sore thumb instantaneously one of these
89:16 things is not like the other
89:18 instantaneously what if you could go to
89:21 South Central LA and convince everyone
89:24 in some meeting that selling drugs and
89:27 any other illegal activity is destroying
89:32 their neighborhood instead of building
89:33 it up and then we give them a vision
89:35 that if they follow these certain plans
89:36 that we supply resources and
89:38 what-have-you
89:38 we get the whole neighborhood set back
89:40 up again everyone's going to school
89:42 everyone has the option of college if
89:44 they want it
89:44 we got trade schools waiting for them if
89:47 they want to learn computers or robots
89:48 or fixing a car making clothing or
89:51 making soap whatever they want to do
89:52 right and they start to see daisies grow
89:57 for the first time in a long time
89:59 plenty of families pull it off I don't
90:01 even know how they do it but they do
90:02 struggle and they do get their kids off
90:04 to college and then become amazing
90:05 people out of those neighborhoods but
90:07 you can talk to these ex inmates there's
90:10 a great channel on YouTube called fresh
90:12 out with big Herc and he is this amazing
90:16 man and he's got badger - I just love
90:19 these two guys I'm gonna try to get Herc
90:21 potentially interviewed over the summer
90:23 time he actually lived in Huntington
90:25 Beach I believe but we get a
90:28 neighborhood cleaned up and then one kid
90:31 starts selling drugs on a corner one kid
90:35 also me see riffraff coming by to buy
90:37 the drugs instantaneously within hours
90:42 if not minutes this neighborhood can
90:44 descend on that situation
90:46 clean it up get that kid out of there
90:47 smack them around get him all ready
90:49 kated what have you or at least get him
90:51 out of there
90:52 maybe he's not from there right this is
90:56 a small example of what we need to do
90:58 the entire planet because after society
91:01 wakes up and during the week of process
91:04 we got to start elect
91:05 people that are read pilled they
91:09 probably you know in the short term
91:10 can't say they read pilled
91:12 I think Trump is very very very read
91:14 pilled and so you know he can't even
91:17 admitted himself if he thought kovat was
91:20 a hoax he can't say it if he did nobody
91:23 thinks it's a hoax or not but he
91:26 couldn't say it if he did because we're
91:28 not read pilled enough in this world to
91:30 have that be an acceptable phrase
91:31 because we have relegated ourselves to
91:34 these world organizations that don't
91:35 invite the world to show up well then
91:39 there's all this pressure coming in
91:41 because mass media is all mockingbirds
91:43 out right
91:44 CIA Mockingbird mid-fifties project has
91:48 always been in action now we'll do a
91:51 little bit of math for 20 years into
91:54 this century it was 45 years into the
91:57 other century so were 65 years into
92:01 Project Mockingbird by net 70s they
92:03 estimated I think in a Senate hearing
92:05 the CIA had admit that they were seven
92:07 hundred to a thousand people on their
92:09 payroll all the biggest pundits who talk
92:13 on TV are all bought out then again I'll
92:17 warn you
92:18 Fox News is about 50% deep state at the
92:23 smallest percentage and the rest of it
92:27 is like you know maybe an Anderson
92:28 Tucker or handed east of trying to fight
92:30 the good fight but they know they get
92:33 diluted someone reads the front page and
92:36 the way that you know that Fox is not on
92:39 anyone's side I mean I'm just speaking
92:41 to people to think that perhaps if
92:42 that's a decent place I think most of
92:44 you know it's not but they will still
92:47 report official narratives and
92:48 fear-mongering
92:50 constantly right they don't go into like
92:53 one day they'll report the fudge you
92:55 said that masks don't work and then the
92:57 next day you can't find the article you
92:59 know so they know you kind of put it out
93:00 there to make you feel loyal and then
93:02 they erase it bury it whatever and then
93:05 the next day they're talking about how
93:08 you have to wear a mask because it
93:09 actually has a physical effect on you
93:10 and has a physical effect it's got
93:13 making the sick making you vulnerable
93:15 doing nothing to protect you against
93:17 anything
93:19 maybe a bacteria so again if I had a
93:23 bronchitis situation I'm coughing up
93:25 constantly and I got to go buy groceries
93:27 yeah I saved I guess I have for masks
93:31 I've never put one on yet one of my
93:34 favorite grocery stores just put a sign
93:35 out front they have not had the
93:37 requirement of wearing a mask I walked
93:40 in the other day and bought a bunch of
93:42 stuff and probably 40 50 percent of the
93:45 store does any masks on the people
93:47 walking in to buy stuff and they keep
93:48 lecturing us at the counter well you
93:50 know it's 9 out friends you're supposed
93:52 to go like well then you're not gonna
93:53 get any more bit my business you know
93:55 the most I'll have it shipped through my
93:57 house but that's about it so this would
94:00 be the last dark episode of this
94:01 particular season trying to carefully
94:05 pick the the 499 still kind of up in the
94:11 air about what to do with that 500 is
94:12 gonna be about Tesla we're gonna get
94:14 into the death ray we're gonna get all
94:15 kinds of cool stuff so I'm gonna review
94:17 his entire life story and sort of the
94:20 implications because there's a lot of a
94:22 lot of insinuations but Tesla's simply
94:25 unfounded based on all the information I
94:28 have anyway if you have me to do
94:31 thoughts radio.com please go that's
94:33 where all the feeds are there's two
