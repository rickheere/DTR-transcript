00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen tonight I thought we would
00:39 talk about the victors getting to write
00:42 the history books because there's a
00:47 little catch to that whole thing and the
00:51 catch is that we are always well let's
00:57 just put this way I got to be careful
01:00 because this is a global thing the
01:03 Internet
01:04 I'm coming to you from the United States
01:07 of America United States of America is
01:11 obviously a very powerful country in
01:13 terms of you have nothing else
01:16 perception perception of itself now I
01:21 love my country I think it's the best
01:25 experiment yet of civilization it is
01:28 being attacked it has been under control
01:30 of some serious scumbags from other
01:32 countries and because those other
01:35 countries in some cases don't fight back
01:36 they allow the ala Gallagher key the
01:42 monarchies to keep them conditioned like
01:45 [ __ ] slaves and again you could live
01:48 one of those countries and you know it
01:49 and you're not one of those people so
01:51 don't take offense hopefully but this is
01:54 why it has to be a global fix because
01:56 the problem I'm gonna describe here is
01:58 its systemic to society and every single
02:02 person in every single country is a part
02:05 of this giant tree of life everyone's a
02:09 root everyone's a leaf a branch and it's
02:13 important that you don't let your
02:15 country get gobbled up by these people
02:19 what baffles me about the small setup
02:23 here what baffles me about the European
02:26 Union and anyone who believes that they
02:28 should be in it is typically they have
02:30 very little research in their life for
02:35 any of these issues they don't know if
02:36 [ __ ] all about history will make that a
02:38 couple curse words at the beginning and
02:40 try to taper that off but you sit down
02:44 and you talk to them and it's all
02:45 talking points it's all
02:47 yes and there's their towing an emotion
02:50 from somebody else from some other
02:52 George Soros pamphlet they got in the
02:56 mail and sadly that the sadly in the
03:00 modern day I'd say the last Jesus 250
03:05 plus years they've been winning and
03:07 winning and winning and of course
03:08 they've been actually been winning for
03:09 millennia but in the modern age of the
03:12 printing press and as it relates to
03:15 newspapers than radio than television
03:18 and filmed and internet we've allowed
03:22 them to gain an upper hand and they must
03:27 be absolutely positively wiped off the
03:30 face of the planet and then in the place
03:33 of them we need museums in schools and
03:37 history books to teach how we almost
03:40 lost ourselves to these people these
03:46 self-important self-loathing people
03:50 their agendas for us are their agendas
03:53 for themselves in some cases they hate
03:55 themselves as human beings because
03:58 they're so utterly bored they've got
04:01 everything so they never struggle in the
04:03 fabric of humanity they're up in some
04:05 cloud somewhere bored to death realizing
04:10 they've never worked a [ __ ] day in
04:12 their life they had everything handed
04:14 down to them and even if they run a
04:16 stock market they're determined the gold
04:18 price there they haven't worked a day in
04:20 their life they really haven't these are
04:25 the victors who write history now what's
04:29 interesting is is that I'm gonna give
04:31 you an example of something that modern
04:33 society laughs at at North Korea in the
04:39 50s after the Korean War
04:43 grandpa Kim had captured a boat that we
04:49 had left behind put it in a museum and
04:53 told all of his people look this is when
04:55 I defeated the United States of America
04:56 and see they're not here right now so
04:58 this is proof
05:00 that I am capable as a single person of
05:05 leading an army leading a people and
05:07 defeating the greatest military
05:10 industrial complex in the world and his
05:13 people believe him because they don't
05:16 have any contact with the outside world
05:18 until recently of course I'm very
05:21 excited about them joining the rest of
05:23 the world I really am because until they
05:28 find all of the covert military
05:32 equipment in that country or cohort
05:35 covert military and I'm sorry I
05:37 shouldn't say military covert
05:39 intelligence equipment in that area not
05:44 related to the military of United States
05:46 of America submarines that have been
05:49 stolen and d-class are decommissioned
05:53 missile launching sites that could
05:55 easily launch something and be blamed on
05:58 them they have to hold off on this
06:00 treaty with Trump they know that there's
06:04 things that are unaccounted for he signs
06:07 the treaty with kim jeong-hoon a deep
06:10 state operative launches a missile and
06:13 it looks like he's backstabbed us and
06:15 then there's a bunch of reactionary
06:17 stuff so they're trying to clean up the
06:20 mess they might also be holding
06:22 something like that for the election
06:24 it's a pretty good news right but
06:28 there's a lot of work involved but if
06:32 you're a part of let's say America or
06:35 Great Britain they're even technically
06:38 Russia during the World War 2 era well
06:45 what happened well the Germans were
06:51 defeated and the Japanese were defeated
06:55 excruciating Wars for everyone and then
06:59 the stories were written about what
07:00 happened to who when where and how who
07:02 was guilty who was good who was bad who
07:06 was on God's side who was on the devil
07:08 side you got Stalin killing
07:12 I don't know officially easily trackable
07:17 I don't know eight times as much as what
07:23 Hitler's accused of killing but you know
07:25 you can see a pretty bad documentary on
07:27 Stalin how bad he was as a human being
07:29 but I don't seem to remember going to a
07:32 stalin museum to tell me not to be like
07:36 Stalin they just caught me this copy
07:39 that hmm when you grow up and you hear
07:45 that phrase the victors write the
07:49 history books I think immediately if
07:52 you're on this PR blitz that is the
07:55 winning team which is your country of
07:58 course you just sit back and you go yeah
08:01 that's right that's right that happens
08:02 that does happen but I'm always on the
08:05 good side so all the history that I read
08:07 is the good kiss the good history real
08:10 history and then you wake up as of the
08:14 Internet's age and you find out that
08:16 perhaps perhaps if you have ever heard
08:22 the truth about anything in your life it
08:26 would have been a folly it would have
08:28 been an absolute mistake on these
08:30 people's parts or would have been
08:32 something so incidental but it didn't
08:35 matter to them or it is the local
08:37 history of your life
08:39 or your mother your father your uncle
08:40 passed something down that they saw
08:43 that's about the only history you could
08:45 rely on and you have to make sure that
08:47 those individuals in your life are
08:49 quoting from some history book because
08:51 if they are it's probably wrong what is
08:55 very very interesting about this 17
08:58 movement online is that I have heard for
09:03 the last 15 plus years that the scumbags
09:07 that run the world invert everything
09:11 you've heard me say it several times on
09:13 the show so if something was left they
09:15 will tell you that it's right if gravity
09:17 is a push they will tell you it's a pull
09:21 everything is switched black is white
09:25 why
09:26 is black then you get killed on the next
09:29 crosswalking many of us have figured out
09:32 through studying folks like Graham
09:34 Hancock that the history of previous
09:38 civilizations is completely skewed all
09:42 previous civilizations have one
09:44 requirement they were either very
09:49 short-lived and inferior in some way or
09:54 they didn't discover technology until
09:58 the white man had already discovered all
10:00 of it and for those of you accused me of
10:02 hating my own race because I might say
10:04 something truthful like that I don't
10:07 hate my own race all right very proud of
10:11 my genes I just think my genes have been
10:14 used for some bad purposes from time to
10:16 time then again I don't think I share
10:18 too many genes with those who are the
10:22 douchebags of the universe I doubt many
10:25 of you are either what's really sad is
10:29 and really striking to me is that you
10:32 don't have some deep state person who
10:35 simply goes I think I'm on the wrong
10:38 team it's not that issues like
10:41 depopulation or population control need
10:44 to be discussed it's not like we
10:46 shouldn't discuss you know renewable
10:48 energy and that kind of thing but they
10:52 get out of these global istic plans to
10:55 do it hastily and messy to do it through
10:59 deception instead of a direct
11:00 conversation it doesn't happen they stay
11:04 down or they're murdered or they're
11:06 muffled or whatever where's the press
11:08 conference where is the live-streaming
11:10 or someone says you know I mean we do
11:13 have defectors from time to time but we
11:15 seldom get a defector at any high level
11:18 you know a Rothschild up a sewer a
11:21 Windsor why can't one of the kids of the
11:24 Windsor family just go you know what
11:26 expertise was a Henry Henry Harry the
11:29 youngest one he's got the wife that's of
11:33 mixed race which is such a big deal over
11:35 there why can't he just look around and
11:37 go you know what
11:40 this Charles guy is not my dad
11:42 and my mom was murdered and you're up my
11:46 ass constantly about what I want to do I
11:48 love this girl you know what I'm gonna
11:51 do I'm gonna move to America real
11:53 quietly and I'm just gonna get on the
11:55 internet and start talking and I know
11:57 they're gonna call me crazy but I'll
11:58 have all my dialogue prepared let's do
12:00 this
12:01 boom change the world it must have a
12:04 really good good control apparatus but
12:08 they have lied so much about everything
12:12 and we just keep feeling like we're on
12:14 the right side of history now again a
12:17 lot of you don't believe that anymore
12:18 but think about it before the internet
12:20 for those of you are over say 3540
12:24 you had a strong upbringing in fake
12:26 history and think about how that
12:29 indoctrinates your mind
12:31 it changes your identity as a human
12:33 being now I have to say would probably
12:37 be very disturbing to think of yourself
12:43 as a race that's done a bunch of
12:45 horrible stuff now in America again we
12:48 inherit the whole Native American thing
12:51 again some of us have family goes back
12:54 before that time but then again they
12:57 didn't join the military until the Civil
13:00 War days my family fought on the Yankee
13:04 side but they could have easily fit
13:07 fought for the south you know who knows
13:09 they didn't what happened in the past
13:13 happened in the past but if we don't
13:16 know what the past is or was then what's
13:20 the value of the lesson I often think
13:24 after waking up a little bit you know
13:27 who knows how much we've either any of
13:29 us have awakened we just know that we're
13:32 a lot more awake than we used to be and
13:34 we have a lot more algorithms to discern
13:36 reality as it moves forward but it does
13:39 get to a point where there's so much
13:42 disinformation and that's the new game
13:45 the new game is idiots watch the news
13:50 and believe it and I mean that quite
13:53 literally absolute morons watch that
13:56 [ __ ] and believe it and repeat it and
13:58 think they're smart so sad
14:02 something would do violently wrong with
14:04 their childhood I mean they're on the
14:06 wrong course to reality and then there's
14:11 those of us like yourself and myself we
14:13 watch the news merely to sift between it
14:16 to figure out what misdirection might be
14:23 at hand what you know playbook they're
14:28 using again some false flag thing that
14:30 they've done again and again and again
14:32 some other ridiculous shooting thing I
14:34 mean New Zealand blew the pooch didn't
14:37 they my god those videos they want off
14:40 the internet completely reveal massive
14:46 massive manipulation that country
14:51 screwed up that particular false flag so
14:53 bad they want to put you in jail because
14:56 they screwed it up you're not allowed to
14:58 see history in this particular case it's
15:01 against the law
15:02 there's two different videos two
15:04 different places to different groups of
15:07 people they say there's one guy but
15:11 you're not allowed to have any of that
15:13 evidence that they broke the law unreal
15:18 and then once we are able to decipher
15:23 through the initial day's events
15:25 whatever's being reported doesn't have
15:27 to be some crazy thing
15:28 then comes the disinfo the five eyes
15:32 disinfo all they're paid shills all
15:36 they're paid shills out there commenting
15:39 steering conversations different AI bots
15:42 that are ready and and just just filling
15:46 up Twitter accounts and YouTube comments
15:48 and anything Facebook accounts the
15:53 amount of fake people trying to get into
15:56 the deep thoughts radio page on Facebook
16:00 that's locked they're not there because
16:01 they saw a video and they want in it's
16:04 simply a bot that comes over
16:06 and throws foreigners at me there's a
16:11 question when you join just so you know
16:14 so say something human and I get some
16:17 funny ass comments by the way I love it
16:18 there's just nothing I can do to reply
16:20 it's funny it'd be nice to be able to
16:22 send a little reply off the invite and
16:24 then send everybody into the page but
16:26 doesn't work like that have to like
16:27 track you down and stalk you to say that
16:29 was hilarious
16:31 read there's tons of fake accounts they
16:35 scrape other people's real profiles
16:38 build an account that's fake and then
16:40 they fill it with a bunch of junk and
16:43 they're so badly written I mean these
16:45 bots are so badly written I can't even
16:49 believe people pay for this stuff that
16:52 the deep state would say oh good job
16:54 these bots don't even attempt to look
16:57 human unbelievable but they try to
17:01 infiltrate so they can do a little
17:04 keyword search on the inside of our page
17:06 I'm kicking people out like crazy
17:08 studying accounts that four hundred and
17:12 twenty some odd accounts I went through
17:16 them twice last couple weeks booted a
17:20 ton of folks anyway history being retold
17:25 and retold I think what's interesting
17:29 for me is that when you when you hear
17:32 that as a kid at leaf you're anything
17:34 like me you're thinking well it's just a
17:35 little bit of history it's been retold a
17:37 little bit of history and the only
17:39 people that retell history badly are the
17:40 bad guys and I don't mean to repeat
17:43 myself what I'm trying to say in this
17:44 next statement here is that we feel like
17:48 if your leaders are good they don't do
17:50 that
17:51 and if your leaders are bad then they do
17:53 do that so there's no worry if you have
17:56 a noble country America would never
17:58 rewrite the history books would they who
18:02 killed Kennedy again we went to the moon
18:07 how was the sixteenth amendment ratified
18:09 again why was there a war of 1812 I used
18:16 to review video games this is a repeat
18:18 from like a hundred episodes
18:20 ago I serve review video games and I
18:23 remember catching myself in the late
18:25 side late 1990s excuse me
18:28 my 1997 I was trying to say I've
18:31 reviewed some the first Call of Duty
18:33 which was world war two bound and I
18:36 think that the title I put on the review
18:38 was the last noble war and then later I
18:43 woke up and that sites gone that reviews
18:45 history so I'm not doing any damage
18:48 anymore but I look back at that and I
18:49 cringe you know what the last noble war
18:53 an American fought the Revolutionary War
18:59 all the other wars were results of
19:03 banker manipulation now he fought off
19:05 the Queen of England 27 year war off and
19:11 on it was a big deal it was us trying to
19:16 hang on to our version of Magna Carta
19:18 that we would you know a few years later
19:22 call the Constitution of the United
19:23 States our forefathers love him or hate
19:29 him they set up checks and balances that
19:32 lasted for awhile I'd say probably until
19:38 they killed Lincoln yes the war of 1812
19:42 was because they were trying to install
19:45 a Federal Reserve type bank and we
19:50 wouldn't renew the lease and so they
19:52 said oh yeah well we're gonna send out
19:53 we know you're weak from the
19:55 Revolutionary War so we're gonna send
19:57 over folks to pound you and then weary
20:00 signed the the document and they left us
20:03 alone now here's some sub fabric to this
20:09 situation and this is something that I
20:12 want to highlight with you I could
20:13 probably make a whole episode on but
20:14 I'll bet it in here and I would
20:17 personally entitle this thought process
20:21 the power of a generation so our
20:26 forefathers are kicking ass and taking
20:28 names in the 1770s they understood
20:33 Europe they understood the insanity of
20:36 the monarchy and I'm telling you if if
20:42 today's British citizens and all of
20:46 their Canadian Australian serfdom states
20:50 and countries that report back to her
20:54 could for one moment do the matrix thing
20:57 where they could know kung fu and we
20:59 could just plug in the history of what
21:02 it was like to live in England and say
21:04 geez 1750 with things like the stamp tax
21:12 some of you know what that is
21:14 Alton all I did a long time ago but let
21:17 me just remind you the royalty of
21:21 England had a stamp tax and what that
21:23 meant was that every piece of paper in
21:24 your house had to have a stamp of the
21:27 crown on it or you couldn't have it in
21:30 your house that sounds insane doesn't it
21:34 what a piece of paper had to have a
21:35 stamp on it what the hell now I don't
21:38 know how much paper was flying around a
21:40 house back in those days but it was a
21:44 reason to allow soldiers into your house
21:46 at any point in time they could just
21:49 knock on your door walk in and say we're
21:51 gonna do a stamp tax search on your
21:53 house it was a reason to infiltrate your
21:56 home and look at everything in your
21:58 house for whatever reason but their
22:02 theory and this is part of the history
22:05 that is supposed to be sifted history
22:08 meaning the [ __ ] it's been left
22:10 behind was that if you were going to
22:14 cabal against the state you couldn't
22:16 keep it in your head you had to write it
22:18 down your secret society would have to
22:19 plan and make lists and so you'd hide
22:22 things under floorboards or between
22:24 mattresses or whatever and they'd roll
22:26 your whole place just like a prison so I
22:28 mean we know that it's easy to plant
22:32 things imagine if they just didn't like
22:34 it it just drops a paper on the ground
22:35 without a stamp and then just take some
22:37 extra taxes out of your pocket and if
22:39 you try to lip off and and try to defend
22:42 yourself and not even lip off you're
22:43 like that's not mine oh yeah well you
22:45 you better do what we say it will take
22:47 you down and take your wife down to the
22:49 precinct and rough her up you could do
22:53 anything if the British people could see
22:58 how crazy it is that this family has
23:01 continued to rule this country you might
23:06 have a change of heart
23:07 I'm just saying I'm not going to preach
23:10 into the choir for most people imagine
23:13 you didn't want the lunacy that Monty
23:16 Python and the Holy Grail so beautifully
23:20 analyzed we're talking to King Arthur
23:24 you know when you watch a movie and
23:27 there's that really good turn in it like
23:30 Empire Strikes Back let's say it
23:33 together Luke I'm your father and you
23:38 realize that the first two films because
23:40 they're saying this in the last few
23:42 minutes of the third act of Empire
23:46 Strikes Back where you find out that
23:47 Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father
23:49 and all of a sudden you have to reassess
23:52 in your mind all of Empire Strikes Back
23:55 and all of Star Wars and you're like oh
23:57 my god I've been operating with the
24:00 wrong information and you know in that
24:04 particular fictional case it's a
24:05 mind-blower
24:06 it's it's a little bit acidic for your
24:09 mind but then again it's also exciting
24:11 to rethink everything there's a bit of
24:15 that when you find out you've been lied
24:17 to about history except you're kind of
24:20 more on the acidic side than the
24:22 positive side depending on what the
24:24 repercussions were of the acidic move
24:28 when I finally discovered that Wars past
24:32 1913 in the United States of America
24:35 were being orchestrated by the bankers
24:37 in Europe using European events to
24:40 catalyze the events such that we would
24:42 borrow more we would borrow money from
24:44 this new fiat currency that they created
24:46 using the 6th 16th amendment in 1913 it
24:52 was the worst kind of revision of
24:56 history war war one world war two the
25:01 Korean War Vietnam and all this Desert
25:06 Storm stuff all the desert wars are all
25:10 to make sure that we stay in debt to the
25:13 bankers of Europe except when we got to
25:18 the 21st century the wars had a subtext
25:23 to them perhaps even the primary goal
25:25 was to make sure that no country in the
25:29 Middle East in Eurasia was allowed to
25:33 operate outside of the world banking
25:35 system it's like they made a 21st
25:37 century resolution and said okay no more
25:41 Arab states can trade outside of either
25:44 the euro or the United States dollar
25:46 they absolutely cannot use any currency
25:49 that we don't control completely and
25:51 we've told them when they've Reif
25:53 resisted moammar qaddafi resisted Assad
25:57 resisted Saddam Hussein resisted Iran
26:01 has resisted and that's why they're the
26:04 primary targets moving forward now Iraq
26:08 has been fixed in their eyes if you
26:13 watch that sasha cohen movie The
26:17 Dictator not to be confused with Charlie
26:21 Chaplin's the Great Dictator I think
26:24 it's way it's way it goes he put it
26:27 right in his movie right in front of
26:29 your face I could not believe my eyes
26:31 when I'm watching this film at home for
26:34 free that had him that one of the big
26:37 plot mechanisms in the third act of that
26:39 movie was what they were trying to get
26:40 his country to reconstitute their
26:43 banking system to the World Bank's there
26:45 was this new constitution he was
26:47 supposed to sign and had all this you
26:49 know shenanigans in it right in front of
26:52 your face now most history it's just
26:58 sort of come and go you hear about it
27:01 yeah that's really bad or that's good or
27:03 what have you when you hear Mount Saint
27:05 tongue killing god knows how many
27:08 millions of people in China getting rid
27:10 of all the and Allah
27:11 Chul's because they could sniff his
27:14 [ __ ]
27:16 you your jaws on the ground and you
27:23 can't do anything about it all those
27:24 people are gone
27:25 China's way into this new age mounts a
27:28 tongue has long gone the red book is
27:29 gone the mango infatuated on they seem
27:33 to be coming around and then some
27:36 history is just unbelievable the Nanking
27:41 massacres are some of the most well
27:44 documented horrific event Americans
27:47 aren't taught this in school at all I
27:50 was taught this like four or five years
27:52 ago by my friend from Taiwan you never
27:55 heard about the Nanking massacres I'm
27:57 like no what the hell's adios it was
28:00 awful and then I was like okay he goes
28:03 I'm gonna show you documentary you want
28:05 to see it and I'm like yeah of course
28:06 and the stuff I saw in this documentary
28:09 which is on YouTube it's mind-blowing
28:13 it's worse than anything I ever saw in
28:16 the Holocaust ever it didn't involve as
28:19 many people I don't think but the
28:22 suffering was documented it was
28:24 photographed it was videotaped I mean
28:27 eight or whatever filmed horrific okay
28:34 but we don't learn that because the
28:36 Japanese attacked the Chinese and you
28:41 know it's like they're not the same
28:42 people anymore of course but it's
28:46 amazing that there was his RIF and
28:47 because I kept hearing this this
28:49 reoccurring story is how the
28:50 conversation came up with these Chinese
28:52 the Chinese government asking Japan to
28:55 apologize for what they did and Japan
28:58 refused and refused and refused or they
29:00 might say they're sorry but they don't
29:02 really want to talk about what they did
29:05 it's a tough one because again they're
29:07 trying to repair it or trying to say
29:09 sorry for something that occurred you
29:12 know 6070 years ago there's no kid alive
29:15 that would probably engage in anything
29:18 remotely like that and if unless they're
29:19 totally psychotic it'd be tough to find
29:23 that kid in Japan
29:25 we're raised in America to think that
29:29 the Native Americans mainly died of
29:31 influenza and smallpox and hear these
29:36 stories like we gave them they gave us a
29:39 blanket we gave it back and we had the
29:42 influenza virus on us and it spread to
29:44 them and it killed them the Spanish
29:46 would bring their swine's the pigs as
29:49 the the conquistadors rode all over the
29:52 United States before it was you know
29:53 balkanized and the pigs would get loose
29:56 in the forest and then they would eat
29:58 them and then they got all the bacteria
29:59 and that's how they died and then you
30:02 hear about the Mormon slaughter of the
30:04 Shoshone Indians very well-documented
30:10 and you realize that these slaughters
30:13 could happen over and over and over
30:15 again and no one would know again I
30:18 don't even know what the indigenous
30:19 population was I'm not sure anyone does
30:21 we can estimate but I'm not sure we know
30:25 maybe there weren't that many maybe
30:27 there was a lot but they crafted that
30:30 history so that I could live with it as
30:32 an American citizen well it was just a
30:34 bacterial difference between our bodies
30:36 and surely there was some truth to some
30:39 of that because if I go to Asia I'm
30:41 gonna get sick if I just eat everything
30:43 on the plate if I go South America I'm
30:45 definitely getting sick it's just
30:48 something that happens we got to get
30:50 everyone's microbes in us but history
30:53 dives as deep as it possibly can into
30:55 the psyche of man doesn't it it is
30:58 supposedly sort of the report card of
31:01 how civilized you are as a people did
31:04 you start a war when there was no
31:07 aggressor were you just an [ __ ] and
31:10 said your land is my land I just want it
31:13 Genghis Khan Genghis Khan gets dragged
31:16 to the mud like crazy there's two
31:20 different size to the Genghis Khan
31:21 Conqueror you got all the way to Eastern
31:24 Europe I think the numbers in 2019 are
31:28 one in a hundred people have Ganga's
31:31 common blood in them you know I have a
31:34 relative that has very Asian eyes we
31:37 think that that's part of that
31:38 bloodline perhaps I say cool but what do
31:44 they tell you about Genghis Khan II he
31:46 goes across the entire Asian Eurasian
31:50 continent all the way to Europe and he's
31:53 raping and pillaging I just recently saw
31:56 a new episode of Grand Tour which is
32:00 really funny by the way
32:01 and they were just saying well he was
32:03 very much into rape he was a rape egay
32:05 rape rape rape rape rape Genghis Khan
32:07 rape rape rape and then I read I read
32:12 some article that was fairly linked the
32:15 article that was talking about the local
32:18 history of all the Genghis Khan
32:20 conquered villages and towns and
32:23 whatever between wherever you know where
32:25 he started man Golia all the way to
32:27 Europe and they were saying you know it
32:30 actually was a lot different because
32:33 Genghis Khan was a fair person and he
32:36 didn't well he had a strategic problem
32:38 he just couldn't afford to lose men
32:40 constantly fighting and fighting and
32:42 fighting and fighting so you show up
32:43 with his massive army and send a
32:46 dignitary in and say well you got a
32:47 choice either let us move in and move
32:50 through and we'll set up will set up
32:55 shop with you and we'll share what we
32:57 have as far as technology and there's a
33:01 lot of villages I guess that that
33:03 integrated beautifully with his citizens
33:05 and it's just they're a part of the
33:07 history of migration yes they were
33:10 aggressors for sure they're showing up
33:12 and doing stuff and again I'm not a huge
33:14 Genghis Khan historian so some of you
33:17 might have phd's in this and as long as
33:20 you've checked and double-checked your
33:21 your your history books with indigenous
33:24 knowledge instead of Western knowledge
33:27 I'll definitely respect whatever
33:29 Corrections or you know elaborations you
33:31 might have but what's interesting is is
33:34 there's been areas in history where
33:36 certain regions of the world were
33:40 dominated by some bad people and then
33:43 some people rose up to stop them from
33:46 from creating financial ruin but the
33:51 problem is they lost
33:53 because that financial power is ultimate
33:56 power in the world right
33:58 you control a bunch of currencies all
34:00 over the world right you can walk up to
34:03 anyone who has an army and go alright we
34:07 have a little problem on our hands we
34:09 have a dude who's who's discontent with
34:13 our control apparatus on his people he's
34:17 fighting back and got-damn and he's a
34:18 good one he's he's really capable so we
34:22 thought we would maybe profiteer off the
34:25 guy let him get up to a certain point
34:27 but then I need your assurance that when
34:29 we say go you're gonna smack him down
34:32 get rid of him completely get rid this
34:34 guy but now we look at history we're
34:37 like well those people that start wars
34:39 whether they're aware of it or not are
34:42 actually creating benefactors and so in
34:48 one realm these these controlling banker
34:51 people might just be going like attack
34:53 guy yeah he's really killing the crap
34:55 out of people he believed everything we
34:57 fed him it's amazing he's starting to
34:59 think for himself so I'm gonna get get
35:01 the little red button ready because we
35:03 can't have one that goes outside of our
35:05 objectives our narratives but we won't
35:09 kill the guy we'll send him off to some
35:11 other foreign country to die
35:13 he really was toeing our agenda we have
35:18 people that are so demonized on this
35:20 planet that their names are used to
35:23 signify really the devil it's different
35:28 in every region right you know and uh
35:30 was it Ethiopia its Pol Pot and Europe
35:34 its Hitler you've got a number of
35:39 dictators in South America Eurasia
35:43 depending on what decade and what you
35:46 know century and millennia you're
35:47 talking about Vlad the Impaler those
35:51 kind of folks now some of these people
35:53 were exactly who they were noted as
35:57 being because they they wanted you to
36:00 believe that they literally put forth
36:02 the body counts the horrific mangling
36:05 and
36:06 and josef mengele but they they wanted
36:11 people to know them as these really
36:13 formidable characters and so some of
36:15 these folks we have if anything we don't
36:17 have all of their deaths recorded all of
36:20 their murders recorded all their
36:21 suffering recorded and if anything if
36:24 they can see us now they're like oh my
36:25 god my body can't so much higher than
36:27 the one you wrote down I'm actually way
36:29 higher than Stalin and way higher than
36:31 you know some other person I'm not
36:36 terribly concerned about those folks and
36:39 it's not all about war in America we are
36:43 sold this bill of goods man unbelievable
36:46 I mean it's it's the current 2019 bill
36:49 of goods that the Democrats like people
36:53 of other races you know they're the KKK
36:56 people they're they hate blacks blacks
36:59 aren't even humans that's all Democrat
37:01 party stuff it's amazing how anyone can
37:04 hang on to those old outdated notions
37:07 look it up people Jim Crow all these
37:13 Democratic senators who were part of the
37:15 KKK my god senator Byrd he was like a
37:20 grand Ku Klux Klan guy Democrat and
37:23 Hillary's greatest mentor mmm awesome
37:27 how's that Democratic Party you know
37:30 working out for you but it's it's subtle
37:33 like you know why was Lincoln shot he's
37:38 shot by some random John Wilkes Booth's
37:41 and washed up mid-twenties actor just so
37:45 happened
37:46 Lincoln was pissing off all of the
37:49 oligarchs of Europe by creating the
37:52 greenback to pay his soldiers during the
37:54 Civil War mm-hmm he was a good man he's
38:00 a really good man John Wilkes Booth
38:03 escapes to England lives on an island
38:05 until he dies his family was like yeah
38:08 we got letters from way after his death
38:10 supposedly lived in his sled lived to
38:12 his 70s no one cares about revising
38:17 history outside of all the
38:20 Wars that are completely instigated you
38:22 know I mean we had a we had a decent
38:24 story for why the war were ones sort of
38:30 started you know Franz Ferdinand getting
38:31 killed in Europe getting all riled up
38:33 and starting this war and then it was
38:35 kind of over in the Germans had won and
38:36 then they just kept a war going until
38:38 the Germans were bankrupt then some time
38:43 passes and there's very important time
38:45 that passed the United States and then
38:48 you have world war two which has Pearl
38:50 Harbor and all those crazy stuff going
38:53 on in Germany rounding up the Jews
38:55 regardless of what you think about what
38:57 happened during the World War 2 era they
39:03 rounded up a whole race they shipped
39:07 them on trains to concentration camps
39:10 what do you think they died or not that
39:13 happened well then I did 6 million or
39:17 300,000 or what have you all right
39:19 still happen still [ __ ] that can never
39:21 happen again I just should a Jewish kid
39:24 today be towing that story and suffering
39:28 every day of their life living in this
39:30 past history for me I don't think so I
39:33 think you need to move on I think if
39:35 you're raising your kids in this guilt
39:37 bubble or the suffering bubble of the
39:40 Holocaust I think you're doing them a
39:41 major injustice it doesn't help them in
39:44 their life it makes them feel like maybe
39:46 they're still gonna get attacked maybe
39:48 maybe they're still gonna get put on a
39:50 train but they have this racial defense
39:52 that is annoying you know I had I
39:57 shouldn't say this specifically as to
40:01 how I knew these folks I had some really
40:04 good Jewish associates of mindless but
40:07 that way down-to-earth amazing and they
40:10 were very proud of their history and the
40:12 even later in life one of them was
40:14 raised knowing all the you know Jewish
40:18 traditions and the other one was being
40:21 taught later in life about it but they
40:24 were very proud Jewish people but they
40:26 also just kind of sat with me one day
40:28 one night late and they were just
40:30 telling me we got her like we meaning
40:32 them have to get off this
40:34 bandwagon of just trying to make
40:38 everyone feel like [ __ ] all the time
40:39 that's what they said to me these said
40:41 look these conversations are going on
40:43 it's like because they have to sit in
40:45 their own family and they're like it's
40:47 almost as if someone is coming in the
40:48 room and trying to control everyone's
40:50 mind by rehashing this history of which
40:54 maybe they have some association with
40:56 sure but it's time to move on they were
41:00 liberated you know it all ended and it
41:02 was it ended up okay in the end
41:05 you know do people in China sit around
41:08 talking about how a mounting tongue
41:10 killed up to 40 million people do people
41:13 sit around in Russia and lose their
41:15 happiness and their life and their
41:17 future and their destiny because Stalin
41:19 killed a bunch of people I hope not
41:23 it's time for you to live your life it's
41:25 time to move on cut the umbilical cord
41:27 of guilt and shame and suffrage in all
41:30 this suffering I should say and all this
41:32 other stuff so history goes way down
41:37 inside the fabric of a person's mind as
41:39 to who you are as a human being you know
41:43 it's um it's interesting you know it's a
41:49 well-known fact that every race that I
41:53 know of on earth - some undiscovered
41:58 tribes perhaps have been slaves at some
42:03 point everyone and I mean what's a slave
42:06 anyway you have to have shackles on you
42:08 do you have to build a pyramid do you
42:10 have to write over on a boat in shackles
42:14 do you have to plough a field I mean
42:15 with slaves are like everywhere all of
42:19 us have some slave in us because we
42:21 don't control our destinies half the
42:23 time right what's interesting for me is
42:27 that I have I mean I've had dozens and
42:32 dozens and dozens of black friends of
42:34 mine and at no point have have been
42:38 sitting in some casual restaurant picnic
42:42 sitting in someone's living room they're
42:44 sitting in my living room or having a
42:45 good conversation or
42:47 getting together for 10 20 years and
42:49 some you know they went up and said well
42:51 because of slavery this that and the
42:53 other thing in slavery this is slavery
42:54 that I don't hear that from them I hear
42:57 it inside the Democratic Party in this
43:00 black lives matter and this these people
43:02 go up to microphones and say remember a
43:04 long time ago the Democratic Party is
43:08 trying to tow this reparations thing I
43:10 mean what a joke the Queen of England
43:14 owned the shipping companies that
43:16 brought these people over the Spanish
43:17 and the French and the Arabs and the in
43:19 the English brought all these people
43:21 over not the indigenous citizens of
43:25 America there's so little bloodline and
43:28 left in this country that is part of
43:30 that southern belt area where slaves
43:34 were like owned by everybody and I know
43:36 our forefathers I've been known to own
43:38 slaves here and there
43:40 again it's a mixed bag of what people
43:46 were treated like my family came over
43:48 and 18 was 16 30 excuse me as indentured
43:52 servants to a plantation had to pay
43:57 their way off the plantation and I think
43:58 if I remember the story right no one
44:01 gets out by just paying their tab you
44:02 got to escape in the middle of the night
44:03 and they kind of knew that was the case
44:06 they all head west but if someone is
44:10 taking the past and saying it equals
44:12 your future it equals your present
44:15 present day that's crazy
44:21 you know as a white kid okay I'm
44:24 blond-haired blue-eyed
44:25 even though you can't tell I definitely
44:30 wasn't raised with any of this you know
44:33 past that's that's riddled with all the
44:35 things that just talked about in fact
44:36 the only thing that really talked about
44:38 of my family were the relatives that
44:40 were you know my aunts and uncles are
44:42 alive and my relatives are all alive but
44:46 you know they go back a few hundred
44:47 years and they'll tell you that yeah
44:51 your great-great grandfather invented
44:53 this and this guy was a doctor and this
44:55 guy it was bullet hole Ellis
44:58 my relatives look that dude up you know
45:01 this that any other thing went to war
45:03 here didn't go to war there whatever you
45:05 know just doctor here doctor there
45:06 whatever scientists and so it was all
45:09 real localized the history so that I
45:12 could feel confident as a child that I
45:14 have a brain that's related their brain
45:16 as long as I work really hard and teach
45:17 myself and Dad to done I should be an
45:20 artist I should be able to be writers
45:21 will do whatever I want to do I don't
45:24 know if they were right on a genetic
45:25 level or if they're just egging me on
45:28 and therefore I wouldn't learn what I
45:30 needed to learn I don't know but imagine
45:34 your kid is brand new and you're
45:37 shoveling down their throat this history
45:40 that says well for a really long time
45:44 for 400 years let's just say your black
45:47 kid and again I have no friends that say
45:49 this stuff so I'm just speaking
45:50 facetiously and if you're black and
45:53 listening this and you were raised like
45:55 this I want you to maybe consider
45:56 cutting off the umbilical cord of
45:58 someone culturally holding you down even
46:01 if it was in your past you're a
46:03 brand-new human being you deserve
46:06 everything that I ever got in life and
46:09 anyone else says in life that you want
46:11 to have that chance and not to be
46:14 hobbled by some deep-rooted
46:17 psychological story that says well for
46:20 400 years they didn't think we were
46:22 human that's their [ __ ] problem not
46:26 your problem what's interesting is I
46:30 mean my whole life I mean I can I was
46:33 born in 69 so I mean it's not the whole
46:36 whole history book but the amount of
46:39 black heroes in my life are off the
46:41 chain I'm gonna fixate on that just for
46:44 one second because I didn't have you
46:46 know a lot of different races around me
46:48 until I moved around a little bit as a
46:49 kid but it just wasn't around me I was
46:53 so shocked when I heard that this stuff
46:56 in these pockets of resistance the
46:58 segregation pockets and these racial
47:00 pockets existed and how how just a few
47:04 years back from when I was born it was
47:07 it was still being decided as to whether
47:09 or not I think it makes black of my kids
47:10 within ten years
47:11 my the year I was born they were trying
47:14 to legislate the Republicans were trying
47:17 to get the blacks and the whites
47:17 together in the Democrats in 1957 voted
47:21 against it oh my god
47:23 how many black persons a Democrat blows
47:26 my mind to pieces they never changed
47:28 they just hit the game baby it's weird
47:33 you don't need history infecting your
47:35 mind and taking down your self esteem so
47:40 that's will get off the racial side of
47:42 things but there's a huge part of
47:43 history but is always racial you know
47:47 there's this thing called Stolen Valor
47:49 I mentioned it once before Stolen Valor
47:52 just to give you the a recap or an
47:55 update on my high knowledge of it I
47:57 guess after 9/11 and the Patriot Act it
48:00 became a felony to pretend to be a
48:02 soldier now if I go running around as a
48:06 police officer you know fall of fate
48:08 garb on me I'll get arrested in two
48:09 seconds so why I talked to this guy that
48:12 was he was said he was part of military
48:13 tribunals for 20 years and he's like I
48:16 don't think it's a felony oh my god you
48:19 need to read the books baby I mean how
48:21 many people are getting off because you
48:21 don't know the law dude really weird but
48:27 it was a felony because they wanted to
48:28 protect the country against people
48:30 pretending to be soldiers without great
48:32 penalty infiltrating our country and
48:35 then doing something and you know walk
48:36 on a base doing something and I think
48:40 that if you are still towing some
48:45 ancient history of your family or your
48:48 race or what have you it's stolen valor
48:52 you don't get a prize today because two
48:55 generations back somebody in your family
48:57 was persecuted you don't we can't afford
49:01 to do that how you gonna get 40 acres in
49:04 a meal to everybody who's black today
49:06 even have to prove that you were here
49:08 when that offer was made you have to
49:11 prove that you were a slave and now all
49:14 these fake genetic tests out there just
49:17 look at Elizabeth Warren and her
49:20 fake-ass [ __ ] banging environment
49:23 I'm named a Cherokee Indian
49:25 just happened to pick a chariot race
49:27 that can't be confirmed through
49:28 bloodlines interesting interesting
49:32 rewrite your own history just be ever
49:35 whoever you want to be the chick from
49:37 the UH double ACP who identified as
49:39 black that was a really interesting one
49:41 I think it's cool if she were to sky
49:44 yeah you know where she kind of did
49:46 eventually because she got pinned down
49:48 so hard on it but she was like she was
49:51 lying at one point about her genetic
49:53 past you can be whatever color you want
49:58 I guess I mean I don't wear a black face
50:00 that's probably not gonna work out for
50:01 you she was doing her damnedest Michael
50:04 Jackson's trying to be lighter she's
50:05 trying to be darker he straightened his
50:08 hair she's permanent it's just really
50:10 weird huh but now what else does history
50:13 do as these victors write it they want
50:18 us to hate someone constantly don't they
50:22 gotta hate gotta hate gotta hate because
50:25 if you don't hate you won't pay
50:28 attention to the person they want you to
50:31 hate and so then they will pay attention
50:33 to them it used to be that armies would
50:37 simply sit there and protect their
50:39 indigenous land they were told what the
50:41 borders were they line them up build
50:44 fortresses build bases and just make
50:46 sure hey so imma crosses that line from
50:49 the other state the other country and
50:50 they're trying to put a stake down has
50:52 the other states sign on it well you
50:54 need to go take out that state and have
50:57 a discussion with that person and
50:58 potentially leaning out the herd a
51:01 little bit but now it's always something
51:04 of aggression and there were aggressors
51:08 Genghis Khan was an aggressor he was
51:10 good or bad he was a good aggressor
51:11 Adolf Hitler was an aggressor but now we
51:15 have fake stories of aggression the
51:19 Vietnam War complete fake story the two
51:23 Gulf of Tonkin incidents which started
51:26 the war which are now completely in the
51:28 public eye
51:29 as being a fake - fake events that never
51:31 occurred never occurred how many people
51:36 know someone
51:37 if you're over 40 that came back a
51:41 little messed up from Vietnam or didn't
51:43 come back at all
51:44 all because LBJ was told by the bankers
51:49 you're gonna kill your buddy JFK so you
51:52 can be President because you have a big
51:53 goddamn ego problem all right all right
51:55 well you could do that but you're gonna
51:57 do a few things for us too you're gonna
51:59 start this war because we need your
52:01 money because every decade we have to
52:04 have something on the ledger that says
52:05 you're in debt to us way over which you
52:08 would normally be if you just existed
52:10 how we ever got peace from 1975 to 1991
52:14 is beyond me
52:16 amazing now the other thing so there's
52:23 two other I mean there's many angles to
52:26 this one of this kind of funny is the
52:29 all the Napoleon comments that are out
52:33 there tried to say he was crazy or
52:36 stupid said that he was short paranoid
52:40 all these things the dude was a calculus
52:44 genius I think he won every war before
52:48 he became the president of France or the
52:49 king of France or the only to call the
52:51 guy Prime Minister whatever ruler of
52:53 France dictator of France
52:55 I think he'd lost two wars in his
52:57 lifetime before the Battle of Waterloo
53:03 amazing the fact that you lost that
53:05 worse actually kind of surprising to me
53:07 he was average height but they say short
53:12 there's this vendetta this vindictive
53:16 and detta that happens sometimes in
53:20 history someone in England had a hard-on
53:23 to nail this guy I grew up as a kid and
53:28 my parents would always tell me the
53:31 British hate the French hate them
53:34 and so when the Chunnel got completed
53:37 and he had France and you know England
53:39 coming together with their tunnels and
53:41 breaking that thing apart and shaking
53:43 hands it was the first time I'd ever
53:45 seen anything contrary to that false
53:48 history but maybe they convinced
53:51 the britain british to hate the French I
53:53 mean there was a war but come on it's a
53:55 tiny little place over there Europe's
53:57 this tiny little thing all these
53:59 countries packed in there all this
54:00 massive culture packed in and I could
54:03 see how you guys would get on each
54:04 other's cases every once in a while
54:06 thank God it's been calm forever it's
54:09 really nice after World War two I was it
54:13 I haven't seen a big scuffle between the
54:16 any of the countries over there and
54:19 somehow they let themselves get
54:21 absolutely overrun the last five years
54:23 I'm telling you right now if Europe I
54:26 know you know this but I need you to
54:29 know it from an American who sits with
54:31 businessmen all day long nobody wants to
54:35 tour your place anymore I haven't heard
54:38 anyone say anything other than I had a
54:40 trip planned to Europe my wife wanted to
54:43 go I wanted to go we just had it planned
54:45 we went over there and we have confirmed
54:47 we will never go back until we hear
54:50 something is drastically changed because
54:52 they said the place is not Europe any
54:54 more cultures dying I think that's a big
55:01 deal I think that's a huge deal I was
55:04 born over there man you know I'm just
55:07 gonna make a really quick mention of
55:09 this because I don't want to harp on it
55:11 because I don't want to offend
55:12 Christians but the lack of history
55:16 around the time of Christ is the reason
55:18 why Christ can exist in your mind he's
55:21 embedded in calendars he's embedded in
55:25 absolute rituals they had to have a nine
55:27 hundred year Inquisition to basically
55:31 kill anyone who was smart enough to know
55:33 it wasn't true it's it's really
55:38 terrifying to think think about the
55:41 Great Awakening how many millions of
55:43 people are awake globally now that we're
55:45 totally asleep now imagine this imagine
55:49 the seventeen movement backed up by
55:53 potentially the president of United
55:54 States right now 2019 imagine that whole
55:58 thing flops somehow they get out
56:01 maneuvered and all of us that are awake
56:05 are they next intellectuals to be erased
56:09 every deep thoughts gone every 17
56:12 movement video gone every website
56:14 cleaned every harddrive cleaned every
56:18 everything wiped out it didn't happen
56:23 some virus that gets dropped on the
56:26 world and they just clean up the bodies
56:28 and you're starving for food they just
56:31 look you up in a database oh you're one
56:34 of those guys wait a step here in the a
56:36 line at the FEMA camp where we're gonna
56:39 shoot you in the head in America you
56:43 know the last hundred years I should say
56:45 the 20th century I've said this a couple
56:48 times in episodes I apologize to the the
56:51 average listener but this is right on
56:53 target here so we got to shoot up some
56:55 flak on this one the bankers hid their
57:00 agenda with false history the 16th
57:05 amendment which started the IRS and the
57:08 fiat currency that we live on now in the
57:09 Federal Reserve which is a private bank
57:12 private for-profit bank with the name
57:16 federal in its [ __ ] name I mean god
57:18 damn it
57:20 how was that legal how is that legal to
57:23 use the word federal in your private
57:25 for-profit company name if there's an
57:27 executive order that Trump is going to
57:28 pass it is that you may not use federal
57:32 in your company name you may not use any
57:35 synonym or or anything that implies that
57:38 you're an official government body just
57:40 like false or stolen valor just like
57:43 just look like a cop that's what you're
57:44 doing you're faking it so people think
57:46 that you're part of the government but
57:49 this amendment was not ratified by all
57:51 50 states which is what it had to be
57:54 Kentucky Oklahoma
57:56 I believe Philadelphia or Pennsylvania
58:01 excuse me claim that there were men that
58:06 came in at gunpoint forcing them to
58:09 ratify this thing blows my mind of
58:12 course the Hearst Corporation jumps in
58:14 to run around with Woodrow Wilson
58:18 Taft claiming that it was ratified so
58:21 everyone just we don't have the internet
58:22 to check anything so that's where it all
58:24 started for America going downhill in
58:27 terms of us controlling our own country
58:30 they kill Franz Ferdinand just like an
58:34 instant this thing signed boom the guy's
58:37 dead World War one tried to drag us into
58:40 it we wouldn't go until 1917 I again I
58:44 will tell you that for those of you who
58:45 think you know over the beginning of the
58:47 Spanish flu is it's our soldiers going
58:50 over there and horrible slave-like
58:52 conditions on boats but I guarantee you
58:55 they popped the influenza death virus
58:58 and when it landed in Spain which is
59:00 where all of our troops were sent boom
59:02 the thing exploded killed 30 million
59:04 people over there that's just my hunch
59:10 do influenza research and then do
59:13 history research on those boats and tell
59:15 me if you don't come to the same
59:16 conclusion I've never heard anyone say
59:18 it but then you have in America the
59:21 roaring 20s it's a flip it's the what I
59:26 said the beginning the episode they
59:27 flipped it they teach kids that this was
59:29 some crazy affluent decade of American
59:33 history well it ended with a 1929 crash
59:37 didn't it so this was a decade where the
59:42 European bankers had already gained
59:44 control over our money in the previous
59:46 decade dragged a little bit of money out
59:48 of us but they were angry at us because
59:51 we were smart still had to kill off the
59:53 intellectuals financially so all these
59:56 toxic loans were given in the 20s
60:00 three-fourths of the money was
60:03 contracted out of circulation all of the
60:06 clauses in these contracts were called
60:07 so they had to pay the loans without any
60:09 money being available so no one could
60:11 borrow any money to pay anything off
60:14 they knew it was a mathematical
60:16 certainty all the people that jumped out
60:18 of those windows they tell you about
60:20 those are people being thrown out of
60:22 windows because they knew what happened
60:24 1929 crash happens the SEC the security
60:28 Exchange Commission is formed
60:30 and in its formation they had all this
60:32 legislation ready to make sure that you
60:35 and I can invest in big things even if
60:37 we had big money because we don't have
60:40 enough big money Robert Kiyosaki talks
60:44 about a lot in his book especially cash
60:47 quadrant then when he co-wrote with
60:49 Trump Roberts a good man at least that I
60:57 know of with his books but then we get
61:02 this guy Theodore Roosevelt complete
61:06 freaking I'll just say that shill for
61:10 the deep state for the bankers he gets
61:13 to come in he rescinds gold out of the
61:17 households of Americans you can't have
61:20 any the idea that we just fought a war
61:22 and we're not willing to fight another
61:24 one to keep our gold is beyond me Fort
61:27 Knox has created everything shipped
61:28 there it's stored there until I mean
61:30 there's no way they could shoot store
61:32 all the gold of America and this little
61:34 tiny building you ever seen the place
61:35 it's super tiny to store all the gold of
61:38 America I don't care if it had a TARDIS
61:40 basement it doesn't have enough room and
61:42 it destroy the gold in America so it's
61:44 being melted counted weighed and shipped
61:47 off to some other location under
61:50 European control by 1934 you can't have
61:54 any you can only have the fiat currency
61:56 transitioning from real money to fake
61:58 money but what's the diversion what's
62:02 the misdirection for the 1930s the
62:05 depression you mean to tell me during
62:08 the Depression a time when people needed
62:10 money like ever like like like never
62:12 before they couldn't keep their gold the
62:16 most indigenous definition of money on
62:19 planet earth can't keep it
62:23 meanwhile they got a game going in in
62:25 Europe Germany's completely bankrupt
62:29 from World War one mid 30s again it I
62:32 think the number is 500,000 or anxious
62:34 to buy a loaf of bread in 1935 and in
62:38 this state of complete poverty Germany
62:41 builds the most former
62:43 people are me in five years the world
62:47 history's ever seen that's ever been
62:50 documented anywhere in non revised
62:52 history or revised history it's the
62:54 fastest most amazing creation ever the
63:00 the air force was amazing the ground
63:02 forces were amazing their uniforms were
63:04 amazing their guns were amazing there's
63:05 machine guns didn't lock up I mean it
63:08 was amazing how do you think that
63:11 occurred the dude was being set up and
63:14 created because why they wanted a war
63:18 that no one would question the United
63:21 States is going to borrow a ton of cash
63:24 everyone's gonna time borrow a ton of
63:26 cash and everyone's gonna end up owning
63:28 our own excuse me these bankers all this
63:31 money but this invasion starts happening
63:34 in Europe and America still wants to
63:36 stay out of the game it Hayes is your
63:37 problem you got to fight your own war
63:38 sometimes and then of course they use
63:42 the Japanese orchestrating the the
63:45 situation with them they get Pearl
63:48 Harbor I just saw a whole new thing
63:50 about Pearl Harbor where had they just
63:52 flown another couple of miles inland
63:55 they would have nailed all kinds of
63:57 military and installations that would
63:59 have taken us completely out of the game
64:01 and a bunch of our boats that are on the
64:03 southern side of the island push the two
64:06 armadas out secretly gave the Admirals
64:11 the naval equivalent of the Medal of
64:13 Honor for following orders boom were in
64:17 the war approximately five years later
64:21 we have not only lost millions of lives
64:25 all over the world we've been fighting
64:27 this Pacific Rim battle with the
64:30 Japanese we can find all this European
64:31 stuff where did you know Hitler had the
64:33 place locked down man it was not easy to
64:35 get in there and do anything into the
64:36 last minute bombing runs mainly my
64:42 grandmother lost her high school
64:43 sweetheart
64:44 yeah person she was engaged to in that
64:46 war then we developed the nuclear bomb
64:50 and believe me I did a whole episode on
64:53 dude atom bottom bombs exist so if you
64:56 guys are gonna throw that
64:57 my face please go see the episode I've
64:59 seen that side of the game just a little
65:04 footnote that I didn't put in that
65:06 episode because I hadn't figured this
65:08 out yet is the airbursts of nuclear
65:10 weapons are the most convincing evidence
65:13 that it exists because you could stuff
65:15 the largest cargo plane on the world
65:17 with TNT and you would never get the
65:18 yields that Russia especially got in the
65:21 sky bursts there's just no way to lift
65:25 that much stuff in the air bikini island
65:28 mishap is another big piece of evidence
65:31 that there was definitely some nuclear
65:33 fission going on there now whether or
65:35 not it's got nine and a half million
65:36 years half-life you know Hiroshima and
65:38 Nagasaki of life chernobyl has life
65:41 Fukushima has life so something is off
65:46 in the propaganda about that technology
65:49 but then that ends right that ends in 45
65:52 we have the baby boomer era both my
65:55 parents were born between 1946 and 1950
66:00 and you know in that brown there but
66:04 they couldn't let it just calmed down
66:08 they start this nuclear threat thing
66:11 that happened all the way through the
66:12 50s they got the Korean police maneuver
66:15 like I mentioned recently then that's
66:18 over we settle down just for a little
66:20 bit well you get our breath together
66:23 then Kennedy comes in he doesn't want
66:25 another one of these damn things in the
66:27 Vietnam era he manages to avoid a
66:30 military interaction in Cuba I mean a
66:33 bigout fallout war my LBJ kills him
66:38 starts it up 1963 - what 1974 an eleven
66:44 year war horrific for all parties
66:48 involved but then we get some peace and
66:51 quiet for a little while all of this is
66:54 banker narrative on top of history to
66:58 make sure that we borrow money and we
67:00 don't complain does anyone talk about
67:03 you know in the average household in the
67:06 world does anyone talk about bankers the
67:09 second that you hear that there's some
67:10 threat
67:11 the middle-east al Qaeda Isis does
67:17 anyone talk about the bankers when this
67:19 goes on I mean in my circles we do
67:21 instantaneously it's the makers it's the
67:23 bankers it's the bankers it should be
67:26 the litmus test for anything going on in
67:28 world history who is benefitting from
67:31 the European Union
67:33 bankers man what do you think the whole
67:36 thing is it's all about a bunch of
67:38 financial collusion to bleed the banks
67:42 from poor affluent countries you know
67:46 Germany is secretly bankrupt so is Spain
67:48 so as France so is Italy all bankrupt
67:52 they're just printing money to survive
67:54 taking loans to survive why those people
68:00 it's a it's a wealth redistribution
68:02 thing you know you see social justice
68:04 warriors get on they don't even know
68:06 what that means what's funny about the
68:09 wealth distribution concept this is sort
68:12 of off topic but if you think about it
68:16 what would you rather have let's just
68:21 say 2019 where you might need to make
68:23 about a hundred and twenty thousand
68:25 dollars a year to survive in Southern
68:26 California let's just say minimum you
68:30 have an IQ of 95 and you've got a
68:34 hundred million dollars
68:35 that's one of your options I'm gonna
68:37 give you this magic wand option you got
68:40 a 95 IQ and a hundred million dollars or
68:43 you've got 160 IQ and five million
68:48 dollars which one you're gonna take
68:51 wealth distribution redistribution you
68:55 got a bunch of kids averaging between
68:56 ninety and a hundred and five IQ very
69:00 scientifically figured out your average
69:03 high school graduate in the United
69:05 States of America thinking that they
69:08 should have everything that rich people
69:10 have and I don't mean coke brothers and
69:13 you know the polo season all these you
69:15 know it was a Feinstein people that have
69:18 just siphoned money out of projects like
69:20 you wouldn't believe the Bush family
69:23 the gore family whatever none of those
69:28 people but just people who work really
69:30 hard they think they should have all
69:33 those things what would that house look
69:36 like you know the 160 guy buys a house
69:39 and the 95 guy buys a house 95 guys got
69:43 20 times as much money what kind of
69:47 hovel craphole is that how it's gonna
69:50 look like when you visit the 95 IQ
69:52 person probably have to continue buying
69:55 homes because just won't know how to
69:56 take care of it trust me kiddies you
69:59 want to be smart because it's it's that
70:03 old it's that old question when someone
70:05 says was that the genie comes out of the
70:09 bottle and two dudes are sitting there
70:10 and they have a couple wishes and it
70:12 wishes what would you rather have all
70:14 the smarts in the world are all the
70:15 money in the world the first guy goes
70:16 all the money in the world and the
70:20 second guy goes I want all the smarts in
70:23 the world because with that I got all
70:25 the money in the world
70:27 so get smart control your destiny make
70:29 more money than you need so you never
70:31 have to think about it that's the
70:32 greatest advice I ever got as a kid what
70:35 blows me away about the moon hoax
70:37 conversation is that you'll have its
70:41 very few folks to be honest with me it
70:43 was with you they come in and they
70:47 they'll tell you how the moon really you
70:49 know the moon missions really happened
70:51 they you know they can't talk about any
70:53 of the evidence I mean they just can't
70:54 they got a couple humdingers but there's
70:58 a reflector on the moon well sorry dude
71:00 the laser reflection experiment happened
71:02 way before the reflector was ever
71:03 dropped off you know supposedly but if
71:08 you sat down any these people and said
71:10 do you think history is accurate or
71:11 false they must think it's all accurate
71:14 and what blows me away about historians
71:18 I just watched a hit piece on Stalin and
71:21 believe me I'm not gonna cut this guy
71:23 any slack but the overwhelming in
71:27 inference about this guy being just this
71:32 horrible human being it was as if he
71:34 couldn't take a crap without killing a
71:36 child
71:37 but he's this respected leader over
71:40 there he's this thug
71:42 he's like Chavez Y Chavez Venezuela you
71:45 know they said well he was a thug before
71:46 he became the president of Venezuela
71:51 probably just some thug II stuff I think
71:54 he was murdered because he was really
71:56 trying to help his country yeah maybe
71:58 he's a total douche down there I don't
72:00 know but the kind of stuff I'm seeing
72:02 coming out of Brazil and Argentina right
72:04 now whoa whoa there are sites that I go
72:09 to every once in a while just unwind and
72:12 they have the stuff that makes me laugh
72:14 and they have the stuff that's horrific
72:16 and I almost go as an imperative to
72:18 remind myself of what living outside of
72:21 a civilized country can be like and
72:24 Brazil used to be amazing
72:26 but right now they're really struggling
72:28 but the the murders going on down there
72:32 are I mean there is more snuff videos of
72:42 young girls young guys I mean I don't
72:45 think I've seen anyone over 25 years old
72:47 murder down there on these videos it
72:52 makes the Holocaust lay down and take a
72:55 nap all right even the crazy experiments
72:59 going on which they have videos of in in
73:02 you know the whole Holocaust thing you
73:07 know in a nothing so the stuff they're
73:09 doing to these kids down there kids are
73:11 doing it to kids you know they're
73:13 they're all getting into gangs because
73:15 it's only way survive because the
73:16 government's falling apart why is this
73:19 Brazil falling apart because the
73:21 president a few presidents backs and I'm
73:23 gonna draw all the oil off the coast of
73:25 Brazil which is the second largest
73:26 reserve in the world okay the biggest
73:29 one is off the coast of Scotland it's
73:31 owned by BP and they haven't admitted it
73:33 to the world but that's where the
73:35 biggest one in the world is but Brazil
73:37 has the second biggest one off the coast
73:41 he said I'm gonna drill at all and I'm
73:43 gonna turn this into the most advanced
73:45 country on this planet and the second
73:48 they did that he said that they
73:50 overthrew him and put
73:51 IMF former executive in and it's turned
73:54 over a couple times since then but they
73:57 just decimated that country I think
74:02 what's the 17 movement and for those of
74:07 you don't know what I'm talking about
74:08 when I say 17 count the letters in the
74:11 alphabet to get to 17 17th letter in the
74:14 alphabet go look up that letters
74:17 movement just put that letter in that
74:20 letter movement in Google and have fun
74:23 she'll be busy for quite a while but the
74:26 dude keeps telling us this is a war
74:28 it's waging right now American soldiers
74:32 have lost their lives already I don't
74:34 know about other countries perhaps it's
74:38 a big one it is potentially the biggest
74:44 war that's ever been fought it's just
74:48 not one that's creating the biggest body
74:49 count thank God but it is the most
74:52 crucial and important battle that's
74:56 going on in human history that we know
74:59 of because we lost it all we lost all
75:02 the history it's imperative that we win
75:07 it's imperative because with technology
75:12 and we have companies in America the
75:15 Boston Dynamics folks what do you think
75:17 those robots are being built for it
75:19 ain't to ship Amazon no it ain't doing
75:22 anything for that those robots are being
75:25 designed to walk down your street and
75:27 shoot everything that's alive they are
75:30 designed to break down your doors go
75:33 into every room in your house and snuff
75:35 you all out that's the objective of
75:39 those robots it may not be the objective
75:41 of that company but that's the objective
75:44 of the buyers trust me and those of you
75:49 know my show you know I'm not an
75:50 alarmist but I'm telling you that's a
75:52 that's a very real deal black mirror
75:54 showed you I think as the end of season
75:57 4 the last episode of season 4 or sorry
76:00 yeah last episode of season 4 shows you
76:02 maybe it's not for you
76:04 three it's one about a little robot when
76:08 there's many of them in the world and
76:10 it's a post-apocalyptic world because
76:11 these robots are out killing anybody
76:14 that ain't part of the game and I think
76:17 this is why to loop back on the
76:19 Christianity thing it's important that
76:22 we simply acknowledge good doctrine for
76:27 what it is embedded in our hearts
76:29 embedded in our methodology towards each
76:31 other and towards our our family and
76:34 friends and don't forget that because
76:36 that's good God inspired knowledge it
76:40 really is but if you hang on to the
76:44 false history of the whole thing then
76:46 you've built a mechanism in your brain
76:48 to hang on to false history of
76:49 everything in fact you might get really
76:53 good at it is my fear we can hang on to
76:58 a movie that teaches us how to live life
77:03 we can life imitating art and that is
77:08 some of the most beautiful and it goes
77:09 way back man it goes way back to the
77:12 Babylonians man a lot of those parables
77:14 and the lessons these people lived in
77:16 peace and almost a utopia on earth for
77:19 God's sake they had it right we're the
77:24 ones that lost it over time over
77:27 millennia and it's been forced out by a
77:30 bunch of bad history in my opinion the
77:34 soul Michael Jackson thing I've been
77:35 covering recently you know if that isn't
77:43 a true situation that leaving Neverland
77:45 thing think about how false history is
77:48 going to rebrand his entire legacy now
77:53 if you did do it we need to know but I
77:56 don't think the two gentlemen have made
77:57 that documentary are the best places to
78:00 get the information and I think it's
78:02 pretty zero for zero after they're gone
78:04 now one of the things I one of the
78:08 lighter notes I want to touch on as
78:10 we're closing out here simply has to do
78:13 with the the technology that's been lost
78:16 throughout history
78:17 false history hiding technology a lot of
78:23 you interested in Egypt it is one of the
78:25 most amazing where I should say Cairo
78:28 the Giza Plateau the Valley of the Kings
78:31 all this stuff the Giza Plateau for me
78:34 is the epicenter of amazement you have
78:40 pyramids that aren't tombs pyramids that
78:43 were power sources and there's pyramids
78:46 all over the world now the others don't
78:50 I mean actually it's been new research
78:51 in South America that they're starting
78:55 to uncover the same exact construction
78:57 with conductive limestone in the centre
79:00 non-conductive limestone on the outside
79:02 or other stones that have those same
79:04 properties we can't look at the ones in
79:07 China and we can look at him but you
79:10 can't dig them out and find out what
79:12 they were constructed of so who knows
79:13 pyramids are very logical structures for
79:16 man to experiment with but though the
79:18 Giza Plateau pyramids are like way
79:20 beyond a little sand castle there are
79:23 certain things in this world that are so
79:25 powerful that if they get in and it's a
79:28 pun that if man gets a hold of it man
79:32 gets to become free very quickly the
79:36 free energy is one of the most powerful
79:38 things that man can get ahold of but
79:40 it's also very dangerous because it
79:41 could potentially creates an
79:44 overwhelming population explosion I can
79:49 always tell you listeners look at the
79:50 look at the graft for when oil was being
79:53 finely refined into a fuel in the 1830s
79:57 and then look at the world population as
79:59 of the 1830s and the curves are almost
80:02 mirrored side by side except that we are
80:08 populating now faster than energy is
80:10 being made available it's the whole scam
80:14 of climate change and climate credits
80:16 they're trying to make energy cost a
80:17 bunch of money so that we don't screw
80:18 too much when the number one thing to do
80:22 is to educate a female because a female
80:27 will lock up her reproductive organs if
80:31 she's got it
80:32 tanishi could have and all the guys are
80:34 just gonna have to work it out by
80:38 themselves right the technically
80:40 speaking a male gets to impregnate all
80:42 day and a female can only carry a child
80:45 you know once every nine months when
80:47 she's pregnant so males are the giant
80:50 populate errs but an education makes
80:54 that a lot better but one of the
80:57 greatest cover-ups in history is free
81:02 energy
81:03 I truly honestly believe that Egypt was
81:10 lit by electricity that they did
81:13 actually heal their people with harmonic
81:15 healing the vibrating all of the all of
81:19 the invaders in your body just like salt
81:22 on a snail you just reverberate it out
81:24 of your system because the atomic bonds
81:26 of your native DNA are stronger than all
81:29 the bacteria in your body that's how
81:31 vitamin C and b-17 kill all those
81:34 microbes in your body and eventually
81:35 cancer but you have the Egyptians which
81:40 have been marginalized because the
81:42 pyramids which are gigantic power
81:44 stations have been sold to you as tombs
81:47 when if you go look at a tomb in the
81:49 Valley of the Kings they're nothing like
81:53 a tomb the religion of Egypt indicates
81:57 the design of a pyramid being used as a
82:00 tomb just study one and analyze the
82:04 other and you're not going to find
82:06 anything similar between these two the
82:09 sarcophagi that's in one of the pyramids
82:13 doesn't necessarily have to hold the
82:15 Pharaoh folks you can hold equipment you
82:18 could hold all kinds of stuff but again
82:20 you have these deep cavernous rooms that
82:24 you couldn't see unless in the day you
82:27 burned a torch in your hand
82:28 well as soon as you bring in a petroleum
82:31 covered thing or some wood stick that's
82:33 burning you got all kinds of ash all
82:37 over the ceiling the place would just be
82:38 black inside that's not the case it's
82:42 beautiful inside
82:43 pristine to this day inside but then the
82:47 world goes sort of dormant for a very
82:49 long time after the after the pyramids
82:53 they ended their reign somehow without
82:56 Europe figuring how to do this because
82:59 the Europe never built a pyramid I mean
83:01 I think if Caesar had seen a pyramid
83:03 again these pyramids go back tens of
83:04 thousands of years which is why they
83:06 were off most likely before Europe and
83:08 the Ptolemies and Caesars came down to
83:11 take the place over
83:13 Cleopatra's family and again Cleopatra
83:16 was a white girl she's a Ptolemy
83:19 she's a Roman so if you are trying to
83:23 peddle the idea that she was black
83:25 because you're black and someone told
83:26 you that story I'm gonna lean off that
83:29 history because it's right in your face
83:31 it's the Ptolemy family she's ninth
83:32 generation Ptolemy full-blown Roman now
83:35 she loved Egypt her family loved Egypt
83:37 so that's something that's worth
83:39 repeating but the whole thing goes dark
83:42 for a really long time we're lighting
83:45 candles who were burning fires there's
83:48 no electricity for a very very long time
83:52 here's Baghdad batteries and that kind
83:54 of stuff we don't have integrated power
83:57 systems and tell this dude well first
84:01 Edison came around with his direct
84:03 current his DC stuff which it's cool
84:06 that he created DC he was just a bastard
84:08 they don't teach you he was a complete
84:10 scumbag in school that guy love him or
84:15 hate him he's a douchebag I mean he he
84:18 killed dogs with AC engines supposedly
84:22 and then dropped him on people Stephon
84:23 put a note on saying your dog died of AC
84:25 you want to buy my electricity not
84:27 Tesla's electricity which gives us our
84:30 next dude Nikola Tesla from Faraday to
84:35 Tesla as I always say these dudes
84:38 discovered how electricity works they
84:41 discovered how it works because they
84:42 discovered ether currents I'm not gonna
84:46 go off on a huge thing on ether don't
84:47 worry
84:49 but with Tesla he had developed ether
84:55 abased free energy
84:57 using Tesla coils to catalyze up very
85:02 low currents stick it in the earth and
85:05 metabolise out infinite energy and they
85:09 shut the guy down they stole his AC
85:12 motors they stole his royalties then
85:16 when he said well okay you go ahead and
85:19 take my AC current because what I'm
85:20 gonna give the world is free energy you
85:22 won't even need those generators anymore
85:25 I'm gonna make myself obsolete I think
85:27 that's what the guy was trying to do he
85:29 didn't care he was like yeah whatever
85:30 you get Plan B wait to see plan or you
85:33 get plan a wait you see plan B you know
85:36 but they shut him down and then this guy
85:40 Einstein comes around and goes eat there
85:42 doesn't exist because if you knew if
85:45 there exists the guys that control me
85:48 because my wife's doing all my history
85:50 for me I mean wife's doing all my
85:51 research for me excuse me he manages to
85:55 patent photoelectric reactions big whoop
85:59 that's like saying I patented water
86:01 making me wet okay in terms of
86:04 scientific knowledge seriously got a
86:06 Nobel Prize for that too but they
86:09 reversed it they took the truth and they
86:13 just reversed it
86:16 why does gravity become a pole instead
86:20 of a push because a push reveals III
86:24 wins what does he throw wins tell you
86:27 well let's research it oh my god there's
86:29 free energy right there whoa how the
86:32 pyramids work ether that's how they
86:34 worked harvesting ether out of the
86:38 atmosphere catalyzing it with a aqua
86:43 ravine below but the catacomb of water
86:46 between the two you just stick a pole
86:49 down inside the Giza Plateau and boom
86:52 the things got electricity rock and roll
86:55 baby my gas light bulbs whoo it was
87:00 noted in this world as discovering glass
87:03 and actually mastering glass not just
87:07 some electricity hits you know the sand
87:10 dune or
87:11 thing and you dig it out here like well
87:12 look at this transparent crap this is
87:14 pretty cool
87:15 now the Egyptians figured out glass hmm
87:20 well let's think about this
87:23 there's hieroglyphs that sure look like
87:25 big giant light bulbs being held by you
87:28 know assistants to the Pharaohs maybe
87:32 they were slaves who knows I think it
87:34 was probably a damn good life but the
87:37 Pharaohs sitting over there on their on
87:39 their throne there's someone in the room
87:41 holding one these big giant things with
87:43 like a snake in the center all right
87:48 well you got something electricity
87:50 you're gonna start applying it to
87:51 everything around you to figure out how
87:53 it works you're gonna shock yourself oh
87:55 my god that doesn't feel great oh I dude
87:57 just fried he just died okay we got to
88:00 be careful with this stuff all right
88:01 but perhaps they BlueGlass put a
88:05 filament inside vacuumed it out figured
88:08 the whole thing out way before Edison
88:10 had to do his 10,000 light bulbs maybe
88:12 they were rocking some serious light
88:14 because all that stuff deteriorates
88:16 glass breaks copper just you know rots
88:19 away there's no history of it but
88:22 perhaps that was 35,000 years ago BC Shi
88:26 Zhai nothing exists from that time
88:28 except a big pile of rocks I want you to
88:32 revise in your head the potential that
88:37 the victors that write history could
88:38 probably be rebranded as maybe the bad
88:43 guys right history you may not you might
88:47 be you know the same race might be from
88:49 the same country and therefore you don't
88:51 want to believe that and surely it's not
88:53 everything but there's a little
88:56 algorithm I've been studying when it
88:58 comes to watching tons of historical
89:01 things on YouTube any time a narrative
89:05 is retold and retold and retold any time
89:11 there are laws in countries that say you
89:14 can't question history or you go to jail
89:17 that is where a big bunch of lies exist
89:23 when movies constantly pound narratives
89:26 just we can't get rid of certain movies
89:29 of history you just can't make enough of
89:32 it and no one's sitting around going boy
89:34 I wish we had another one of those
89:35 movies covering that piece of history
89:40 History Channel interesting discovery
89:44 chin Discovery Channel goes in and
89:47 revises what science with a capital S
89:50 the new religion History Channel it
89:54 reinforces the victors what they want
89:58 you to believe about what they did and
90:00 even if you know and the thing is is
90:02 what if they lured you into it
90:04 it might be an imperative for you to
90:06 believe that false history simply to
90:08 clean your own slate so if you find
90:11 yourself in need of false history or
90:14 even any history to gain some validated
90:19 existence in this world then I would say
90:22 to you maybe you know go from the
90:27 Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz - the
90:29 one that realized you don't need it they
90:34 always say truth will set you free don't
90:35 they what was that a cliche that's false
90:38 or is that a cliche cliche this is real
90:41 I'm gonna side with it being pretty real
90:46 it's with the truth boom it's all about
90:48 isn't it the Great Awakening has got a
90:50 foundation a bedrock of truth but we're
90:53 trying to figure out what the hell is
90:55 true you're not going to get any help
90:58 from the official narrative anywhere the
91:01 history books aren't going to help you
91:03 unless it's a book that's literally
91:04 titled how everything you've been taught
91:06 is wrong and there's a few books like
91:08 that and I do research for screenplays
91:13 those books they're out there you know
91:17 they do if some of them do an amazing
91:19 job showing you all their sources it's
91:23 something to think about isn't it I
91:25 think you feel me it's going on for
91:28 quite a while here I got a ton of
91:30 episodes people turn episodes I'm just
91:33 looking at my key to pushing out
91:35 like four or five episodes in a week and
91:37 I'm still looking at five episodes in
91:38 the queue and then this one my computer
91:41 is uploading two of them right now so
91:44 that gets to the website deep thoughts
91:49 radio.com its main value to you is
91:52 switching your feeds to whatever you
91:54 like how you like to be notified about
91:55 the episodes and how you like to ingest
91:57 them a lot of folks do both video and
92:00 audio so both those feeds are up there
92:02 you'll want to access the RSS feed link
92:06 on the website with probably a mobile
92:08 device that has an RSS feed upon it so
92:11 get your podcast app all in there on the
92:13 Apple that's gonna meet Lee go to the
92:15 podcast app on the Android though yours
92:18 truly uses podcast addict addict it's a
92:24 great application it's there's a free
92:26 one and there's a one you pay for but
92:29 the one you pay for is like three bucks
92:30 or something like that believe me it's
92:32 worth every penny it's what I used to
92:34 monitor the show if I want to see if my
92:36 episodes are sounding the proper the
92:40 other one is the lock Facebook group
92:41 again as I always brag the folks that
92:44 are on there I mean we have so much fun
92:46 on there like just you know I hear
92:49 myself say this in previous episodes and
92:51 then the you know I'll hear this
92:53 repeated like four weeks from now when
92:55 the episode finally makes it out the
92:56 door and something else will have
92:58 happened that day that's just fantastic
92:59 so so far we just have a great group of
93:03 people so please join if you're a
93:07 facebook person you'll have a good time
93:08 it's just a good feed to have in your
93:10 home feed you know when you're like I'm
93:12 bored you just hit the deep thoughts
93:14 page or it's part of your feed you know
93:15 and it's like there's some funny memes
93:17 up there and great conversations if you
93:19 see a funny meme my advice to use if
93:21 there's any comments look at the
93:23 comments because some of them just
93:24 hilarious right
93:27 Twitter's up there for any of you want
93:29 late notification so these episodes are
93:31 out there that it's up there but some of
93:33 you like to share off your Twitter I'm
93:35 new to Twitter I don't really get into
93:37 it that much and he has I've had some
93:40 great benefits from from Twitter which
93:43 you'll learn about later this year
93:45 but the other one is a patreon page and
93:47 that's sort of like a tipping site so if
93:50 you guys want to financially contribute
93:51 to the to the page they do work in
93:54 pledges I have one of my loyal pledgers
93:58 so you know I just like to give you just
94:00 like a tip just say there's some money
94:02 boom but I guess the interface is mainly
94:06 like a monthly thing and so some of you
94:09 don't want to have monthly subscriptions
94:10 and I completely understand so you can
94:11 just think you could turn on a pledge
94:13 for a really short period of time like a
94:14 month and then it just charges you once
94:16 and it's over
94:18 so whatever floats your boat it's cool
94:20 just a quick footnote I have tried a bit
94:24 shoot and bright tea on both those sites
94:28 so far are not ready for primetime at
94:30 all their interface is simply do not
94:33 work I don't know how any one's getting
94:34 content on that site I feel like I feel
94:38 like there's I mean I'm just gonna say
94:43 this I said it before I think there's
94:45 quite a bit of behavioral evidence that
94:47 this is another silly ass attempt to
94:50 create some YouTube free speech zone
94:54 because it's anything but easy to upload
94:57 I should have been able to just take
94:58 like vid dummy but you're gonna hear me
95:00 save it got me a lot and probably season
95:03 2 episodes they were straight up man I
95:05 joined they had a one-hour lemon I
95:07 talked to the moderators they lifted the
95:09 limit they loved the channel got
95:11 everything uploaded over the course of
95:13 about a month and it just worked it was
95:15 amazing it was it was a really cool
95:17 interface but somehow they got taken
95:19 down too so the fact that independent
95:23 organizations that really work got shut
95:25 down and the new ones are impossible to
95:27 use should tell you something maybe
95:30 those aren't really what they are
95:32 putting themselves out to be and I'm not
95:34 gonna try a million times men so anyway
95:37 take care of yourself in someone else
95:39 and I will see you in the next deep
95:40 thoughts over now
