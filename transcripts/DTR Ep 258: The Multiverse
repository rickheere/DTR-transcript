00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts I was still playing with
00:38 the audio levels on this particular
00:41 system so again I might say this a few
00:43 times just know I'm aware of mouth
00:46 noises and a bunch of other
00:48 environmental sounds so trying to do
00:51 what I can to make it not disgusting to
00:53 listen to someone else talk today I
00:55 thought we'd get into the multiverse and
00:59 for those of you who study that's sort
01:01 of subject matter you're gonna
01:02 immediately know what I'm talking about
01:03 and some of you're gonna be like okay
01:05 what the hell is that first and foremost
01:09 you must understand that the multiverse
01:10 is nothing more than a theory and it has
01:15 to do with the idea that the fabric of
01:21 the universe is capable of vibrating so
01:25 quickly that it's able to sustain
01:28 multiple versions of the same reality
01:32 pretty much theoretically at the same
01:34 time now the technicality is is that
01:39 actually can't do it at the exact same
01:41 time at least as we have modeled energy
01:45 in the universe I'm gonna use a few
01:47 graphics that are probably an upgrade to
01:49 help narrate this just a little bit
01:51 because I don't think we need a lot of
01:53 you know imagery the image we need to
01:56 use to get this conversation going the
02:00 first image we need in our mind is a
02:02 sine cosine wave and for those of you
02:05 don't exactly know what that is it's
02:07 just a wave like a like an ocean wave
02:10 that goes up and then down and the
02:13 back up and it connects on both sides
02:15 usually you see them in those old
02:17 oscilloscopes where those are like those
02:21 well put this way it's almost like a
02:24 heartbeat wave except it's extremely
02:25 smooth and perfect the sine cosine wave
02:29 is our model of a vibrating fabric any
02:33 one unit that we might say is the base
02:37 unit that we talked about in the fabric
02:39 of the universe which on this particular
02:40 show is usually an ether particle when
02:44 it shakes and it shakes because it
02:46 bounces against its neighbors you track
02:50 that vibration you check how much it
02:53 vibrates how much does it vibrate let's
02:55 just say in a relative positive way and
02:58 a relative negative way why do we say
03:00 relative well at some point you have to
03:04 have zero in your counting system and
03:07 then you can go up into the registry of
03:09 positive numbers and negative into the
03:11 negative numbers right you can get into
03:14 fractional numbers and it's quite
03:15 amazing that very quickly your brain
03:18 starts to blow up because you start to
03:20 conceive of infinity in the divisible
03:24 sense meaning you can look down and down
03:26 and down into something really small
03:28 then you can look up up up into
03:30 something huge what we're going to be
03:32 talking about is probably the smallest
03:36 possible division of movement that can
03:40 exist for those of you in quantum
03:43 mechanics it would be your quantum power
03:45 packet your energy packet the unit of
03:48 energy that cannot be any smaller than
03:50 and what it is it is either on or it is
03:53 off there is no in-between up from that
03:56 quantum packet we will start creating
03:58 the next higher level of measurement and
04:00 construct which would be combining these
04:03 packets of energy observing their change
04:05 in a larger grid and tracking what we
04:08 would call a vibration the bummer earth
04:11 quantum physics is that doesn't
04:13 acknowledge ether particles and so when
04:16 you have the concept that is more
04:17 provable and observable in the world
04:19 which is ether and this theoretical
04:21 model on paper which contributes a
04:23 tremendous amount of understanding
04:26 to mass and energy interchanging its
04:29 velocities with each other it's sad that
04:32 we haven't brought them together but
04:34 again the energy companies don't want
04:35 you to know about ether because ether
04:37 start solving for energy problems
04:39 without any sort of field that you have
04:41 to dig up out of the ground but today's
04:44 episode was really kicked off by me
04:48 watching Cloverfield paradox on Netflix
04:51 and I guess it has some fairly harsh
04:53 reviews I haven't checked it out but
04:54 I'll tell you what for my money it was a
04:58 great story you really cared about the
05:00 characters the cg was just as good as
05:03 any cg in any film you've ever seen for
05:07 those of you have seen it the surprise
05:09 ending was fantastic that's all you got
05:11 to know I say go see it but your humble
05:14 narrator I would have given an 8.5 easy
05:19 you know they I think the actors did a
05:22 great job and you know they did they it
05:26 would have gotten a 9 or a 10 but the
05:27 problem is they're obviously
05:29 cannibalizing a lot of other great
05:32 sci-fi but I tell you what the reason
05:34 why I got an 8.5 is they did such a
05:36 beautiful job stitching together other
05:39 stories from other movies I mean they
05:43 must have stitched 10 10 movies together
05:45 to make that script but they just do a
05:48 wonderful job at anyway in that movie
05:51 they deal with the multiverse and it's
05:55 it's revealed very quickly in the first
05:56 acts of not really ruining anything for
05:58 you whatsoever and I won't tell you
06:00 anything else about the episode we're
06:01 done with that
06:02 but the multiverse came up you know I
06:06 don't can't remember how many decades
06:08 ago but it was really accentuated with
06:10 the CERN Large Hadron Collider the LHC
06:13 if you have any interest in the LHC it's
06:17 one of my more observed videos where I
06:20 break it all down and go through the
06:21 conspiracies of it that it gets it back
06:22 and I think it's season one but if not
06:26 it's it because I remember the camera
06:28 angle was weird back in the old days but
06:31 the big question was to find the the god
06:36 particle
06:37 the boson whatever they call it particle
06:40 and you know winded up happening in my
06:43 opinion was they didn't really find it
06:45 so they may made it up because they
06:46 spent 10 billion dollars on this thing
06:49 that had a huge catastrophe when they
06:50 turned it on for some low accelerations
06:52 and then put another 5 billion and to
06:54 fix the catastrophe and so I think
06:56 someone in the end just simply said
06:58 you're gonna find something so you
06:59 figure out how the hell you want to tell
07:01 the public this and they were looking
07:03 for a certain vibrational frequency for
07:06 the fabric of the universe really
07:07 they're looking at two protons slamming
07:10 into each other right and there was a
07:14 multiverse frequency and there were sort
07:16 of forgot to call up it's the singular
07:19 universe frequency one is very stable
07:21 one is very chaotic and what they did
07:25 was they came out to the public and said
07:27 they found them the god particle right
07:30 in the center of these two frequencies I
07:32 mean the absurdity the absolute
07:36 absurdity I'm not gonna swear if I can
07:38 help it of them saying they found it
07:40 exactly in between the two different
07:42 PhDs that we're looking for their
07:45 particular frequency is just it's a
07:49 gut-busting joke for a physicist that
07:51 anyone bought that line of crap right my
07:54 god but as I said in my episode about
07:56 CERN a hadron collider the problem is
07:58 there's too much pressure on these
08:00 scientists to immediately come up with
08:02 something almost everything that we've
08:04 come up with it is their cure to
08:06 something or some invention was was
08:08 humbly created by the creator you know
08:10 Thomas Edison although being a total
08:12 [ __ ] to Tesla and killing animals and
08:16 being a bastard he was able to invent
08:19 what he invented on his own timetable
08:20 right he did work around the clock it
08:22 take cat naps I suppose you know all
08:24 these romantic horseshit stories about
08:26 their lives but whatever but no one was
08:29 pressuring them so the Hadron Collider
08:30 had a lot of pressure on it to come up
08:32 with something but what is a multiverse
08:34 situation well imagine that within the
08:37 time that you have to acknowledge your
08:39 reality there is only enough vibrational
08:41 frequency to sustain one instance of
08:47 life we're going to get into this gonna
08:48 get a little bit theoretical here
08:51 all this is theoretical guys so this
08:54 could be complete BS but as handed down
08:56 by the some of the most prominent
09:00 thinkers in this area I bring you this
09:01 episode with some extended thought okay
09:04 the idea is with a certain low frequency
09:08 of vibration the notion is is that you
09:11 can only sustain a single universe the
09:14 faster frequency operates within a time
09:16 table the theory is is that you can
09:19 start stacking universes
09:21 it's as if they can it has enough
09:23 vibrational frequency to give you two
09:25 images of reality at the same exact time
09:27 and I'll give you an example of this I
09:31 specialize in 3d the technology that
09:34 makes 3d happen okay in order to create
09:39 3d the best 3d you have to and there's
09:45 two ways to do there's passive and
09:46 there's active passive 3d is what you
09:48 get when you go to the movie theater
09:50 where they have interlaced two images
09:52 together they're using every other pixel
09:54 on the screen that you're watching to
09:56 hand you left and right eye data
09:57 aligning it vertical and horizontal and
09:59 it uses polarized lenses to filter into
10:02 each eye the appropriate image the only
10:05 bummer with passive 3d is that if you
10:08 were watching a 4k image for instance
10:09 because every other pixels going into
10:12 your left eye every other pixel is going
10:13 to your right eye what you're really
10:15 observing is a 2k image because you're
10:20 not getting all 4k in each eye when you
10:22 go up to active you have a technology
10:25 that is what we call shutter glasses or
10:28 active glasses it blinds one eye let's
10:30 the other I see and then opens a cyan
10:32 blinds the other eye and it does it so
10:34 quickly it does it 120 frames per second
10:37 for a 64 60 second a 60 frames per
10:41 second piece of original footage and you
10:44 get to have 4k in one eye shut 4k and
10:47 the other eye shut and it's able to
10:49 accomplish this again 120 times per
10:52 second okay so if I you bring you a
10:56 television some of you bought 3d
10:57 televisions and you watch some really
10:59 cool movies in your home with active
11:01 glasses usually it's a an active
11:03 solution
11:04 because we haven't got passive LED
11:07 screens just yet some of you who jumped
11:10 on 3d in your home for computer gaming
11:12 same exact situation 120 hurt monitor
11:15 right usually the monitors sell at a
11:17 hundred and forty Hertz but but then
11:23 they created these 240 hurt monitors and
11:29 then something magical can happen which
11:31 I don't think anyone really developed
11:33 the technology or the drivers to do it
11:34 but here's what's possible with 240 and
11:37 this is a pure example of how multiverse
11:39 might work at 240 we have a big 80 inch
11:45 television in front of you let's just
11:46 saying it's a 240 frequency Hertz
11:49 monitor I can give one of you a hundred
11:53 and twenty frames per second left and
11:55 right eye flickering back and forth and
11:58 I give the person sitting next to you
11:59 their 120 Hertz so two people are
12:03 looking at the same monitor and seeing
12:05 completely different things imagine
12:08 playing a PlayStation game multiplayer
12:10 one of you sees the first 120 and the
12:13 second person sees the second 120 so you
12:16 have two people looking at the same
12:17 screen it looks like you have two TVs
12:19 pretty awesome Ram I'm working with some
12:22 patented technology that is actually
12:24 able to do over 2,000 Hertz so you can
12:29 imagine the possibilities there but the
12:32 idea is that if the if the fundamental
12:35 particle of the universe which they're
12:37 calling the god particle okay the god
12:39 particle is absolutely a Frankenstein
12:41 particle on paper of everyone's theory
12:45 it's almost as if you had you know
12:48 social justice warriors designing
12:49 physics well you know mine gets in there
12:52 too you know okay yours can be in here
12:54 too and they they add it to the god
12:56 particle it's it's really silly so the
13:01 reason why I bring up this kind of
13:03 absurd 3d thing is that you'll notice
13:06 that within the time frame that you are
13:07 sitting on this sofa if I speed up the
13:11 frequency of the television you're able
13:13 to get two people to see distinctly
13:15 different screens
13:17 if the technology I work with could
13:21 develop the software to actually take
13:22 advantage of 2,000 Hertz screens imagine
13:24 that we could have a whole room full of
13:26 people staring at the same screen
13:27 obviously the audio has to be
13:30 transmitted a different way but you
13:33 could be you know imagine a bunch of
13:35 soldiers in the military on in some base
13:40 in the desert and they're all trying to
13:42 talk to their relatives and all we have
13:44 to do is put headsets on every single
13:46 one of them
13:47 blinding out that the sound around them
13:49 and they're all using one screen ten of
13:51 them at say 1200 Hertz and they're all
13:55 able to see ten different people on the
13:58 screen and so the military doesn't have
13:59 to transport a billion screens over
14:01 there to have everybody have a
14:02 conversation okay you get it now take
14:05 the take the fabric of the universe you
14:08 can call it the god particle if you want
14:09 I think the anatomy of the god particle
14:12 is a joke but anyway if it vibrates fast
14:16 enough that within a particular instance
14:19 of what we would recognize as time which
14:21 I don't think really exists but time is
14:23 sort of what we quantify as the past
14:27 record of the rate of change the thing
14:31 is you must remember that change is
14:33 always a relative Delta to some previous
14:35 state right so you know if somebody said
14:41 where's your uncle then there's a
14:45 relative state of that answer well he's
14:47 in Los Angeles oh really
14:49 well that's great where's your uncle
14:51 right now well he's still in Los Angeles
14:53 but if someone comes in he goes what
14:55 room is your uncle in I don't know he's
14:58 probably in the bathroom
14:59 well what room is he in now oh he's in
15:01 the living room well that person cares
15:03 about a smaller level of granularity the
15:06 person just cares about you know what
15:07 city they're in what planet they're on
15:09 right so when you talk about time it's
15:12 all relative to what you are trying to
15:15 track in terms of change and then you
15:17 have to have the elements that you're
15:19 trying to to discuss within that time
15:21 packet we're talking about earth
15:23 rotation are you talking about now
15:25 you're talking about this little cell on
15:27 my chest what is it doing right now
15:29 again so
15:31 it's you have to keep all these things
15:32 in perspective but the idea is that the
15:35 fabric of the universe is perceived as
15:38 two different things typically it's not
15:40 perceived as two different things in a
15:41 single individual you usually pick one
15:44 of the other theories that I'm about to
15:46 present to you the most fundamental
15:48 theory and the one that's probably
15:50 easier to believe because again we don't
15:53 have the ability to even observe the
15:55 fabric of the universe at any at any
15:57 level at least that is publicly
15:59 announced is that we are created by the
16:05 very vibrations that are the ether all
16:07 winds of of the universe that is a
16:12 purely scientific observation right that
16:15 we are nothing more than the mass-energy
16:18 fabric that's out there and again just
16:21 for those of you who are new to the show
16:22 in this show we say you know energy that
16:25 moves slower x' recognized as mass
16:27 energy that moves faster is recognized
16:29 as energy light thermal energy whatever
16:32 you want to do x rays all the way up to
16:35 like was it tachyons with your vertical
16:39 particle that goes faster than speed of
16:40 light and cannot go slower than this be
16:42 late for those of us that believe that
16:44 perhaps were a symbiotic being that
16:46 there's a little bit more to us than
16:47 just the the body that we own for for a
16:52 brief visit here on earth if you believe
16:56 that there are souls for instance some
16:58 other form of consciousness that merely
17:00 rides a carrier wave then the
17:05 illustration goes from being a sine
17:07 cosine wave that you are purely and
17:09 absolutely made out of into a sine
17:11 cosine wave that carries another wave of
17:15 energy or consciousness that is who we
17:18 are deep down inside now that's a very
17:22 remedial visual on probably what would
17:26 be the case if that were true
17:28 once the multiverse happens once we get
17:32 through and we accept the general theory
17:35 of it that we can vibrate
17:38 well sorry that the universe itself
17:40 vibrates so quickly that it could create
17:42 overlapping instances
17:44 of reality there's two ways to look at
17:47 it and a lot of films have gotten into
17:51 this and even books through read you
17:53 know just fun fictional books have got
17:54 into this we'll get into quantum
17:57 frequencies here because it's based on
18:00 this principle you know that if you took
18:03 the sine cosine wave and you had a
18:05 oscilloscope and you were creating or
18:08 just to have a computer simulation
18:09 that's creating this wave in front of
18:11 you it gets extremely smooth up-down
18:13 wave okay if you turn the knob to
18:17 increase its frequency you'll have a
18:21 bunch going up and down so close that it
18:25 starts to get taller and taller and
18:26 taller sometimes right because it has to
18:28 make this journey really really fast and
18:31 you might start to think well gosh it
18:34 looks like there's a bunch within a
18:35 certain time table now regardless of how
18:38 fast you oscillate a single wave of
18:40 energy none of the waves are going to
18:43 touch the previous wave
18:45 they just won't waves don't necessarily
18:48 come back against other waves the
18:50 there's a there's a trajectory of vector
18:53 of time that is moving to create the
18:56 wave and so no matter how intensely
18:58 quick you make it or the low resolution
19:01 of your monitor that might stack
19:03 everything up to look like a line that's
19:04 really thick the idea is it is still
19:07 separate because space is indivisible or
19:12 divisible infinitely there's always a
19:14 little bit of space for those of you
19:16 have ever contemplated the the notion
19:20 that how do i touch my two fingers
19:21 together because as soon as i get them
19:24 close together i could zoom in
19:26 theoretically and create infinite space
19:28 between them or now a lot of space I can
19:30 bring them close together again and zoom
19:32 up again and bring them close together
19:34 again and if he's only you can keep
19:35 zooming in on on mass-energy your
19:38 fingers should never be able to touch
19:39 because in some crazy super accelerated
19:43 time you could always beat the
19:46 connection point this is weird paradox
19:48 okay it's got a name I forgot what it is
19:51 so how do we get to the point where you
19:55 have okay so multiverse doesn't claim to
19:57 have any
19:58 to do with being able to see the other
20:01 universe multiverse is simply the theory
20:04 that we would have enough of a carrier
20:07 wave okay to sustain a uniqueness within
20:10 a certain amount of time and what they
20:12 try to do is say we only need so much
20:15 unique information per second to sustain
20:17 our universe perhaps a single bump on
20:19 this wave and so all these other bumps
20:22 that are occurring are donated to other
20:24 universes that have their bumps within a
20:27 certain quantifiable time that such as
20:29 time and again you can start to see
20:31 where it becomes absurd that that you
20:34 would actually need some form of overlap
20:36 in order to create a multiverse in
20:38 reality because all you end up doing is
20:41 theorizing that there's multiple
20:42 universes on these different bumps and
20:44 distinctions of vibration when we could
20:49 be consuming every single vibration for
20:51 our own fabric so then it goes into two
20:54 different realms one we have a second
20:58 material second piece of information
21:00 that is traveling on top of the wave and
21:02 it is merely changed through time
21:05 because of the lower vibration or the
21:07 higher vibration or the vibration of the
21:09 fabric underneath it it's changing us
21:12 it's churning us it's like the blades in
21:14 a blender we're going to be drinking the
21:16 thing that's actually above the blades
21:18 but the blades are the things that are
21:19 creating the smoothie that we're about
21:21 to consume right we are the smoothie I
21:25 like that let's make some t-shirts to
21:27 say that it'll be our joke the other one
21:31 is that you have different planes of
21:33 existence and when you have a different
21:36 plane of existence you have to adopt a
21:39 few different theoretical philosophies
21:43 of the universe which is that a single
21:45 plane of the universe in a
21:47 two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate
21:48 somehow is able to transmit and create
21:51 enough information but it actually
21:54 creates not only the X and y axis but it
21:57 creates the z axis as well some of this
22:00 is solved by saying we are in on the
22:03 surface of a sphere
22:05 it creates an infinity on the surface of
22:08 a sphere some folks get really elaborate
22:10 and they turn this sphere inside out and
22:12 mad
22:12 mónica they go this is what we're in so
22:14 now we have full depth depth perception
22:18 within this model because we have a Z as
22:20 well as the next y so we start to create
22:23 this three-dimensional universe when you
22:24 live on the surface of an inverted Sofia
22:26 sphere to their definition they say it
22:30 has enough information to create depth
22:32 and has enough information to create
22:34 position and because you're changing
22:37 your position in depth at all times
22:40 you have the conceptual model of time do
22:43 whatever being lives on the inverted
22:45 sphere I told you it's gonna be deep but
22:49 the notion is is that you have a bunch
22:51 of stacked up planes on one of the
22:53 theories again you can shape the plane
22:55 however it turns you on some a sure
22:59 thing you know some inverted sphere some
23:02 mobius strip thing then the idea is that
23:06 they have their universe and we have our
23:09 universe the notion that becomes
23:12 romantic and a science fiction sense is
23:14 that we have so many vibrations and
23:16 cause causal or causality that has made
23:21 our universe and cause-and-effect models
23:23 that make us and made us exist at this
23:26 time meaning this state of existence
23:29 which is the now which is the only time
23:30 that exists that we assume that our
23:33 brothers and our cousins that live next
23:35 to us as we move away from our point
23:38 let's just say we have a bunch of
23:40 records bunch of old vinyl records in
23:43 some cabinet all the records next to us
23:46 the two next to us are the most similar
23:47 to us and the two outer less similar and
23:50 it goes all the way out you know if you
23:53 want to do inverted spheres you have to
23:55 think about the same exact situation
23:56 except you have a bunch of spheres that
23:58 are going down in and out right science
24:02 fiction writers do a great job taking
24:04 advantage of this theory because their
24:06 idea is to say if you were to go to your
24:09 next next-of-kin plane left or right
24:12 let's just say for the sake of argument
24:14 you're going to find yourself almost
24:17 perfectly duplicated there wouldn't be
24:20 any major difference there couldn't be
24:22 theoretically any major difference
24:24 between the guys
24:25 to the left and the guys to the right
24:27 there couldn't be you know you having an
24:32 extra brother or sister in those two
24:34 realms it's too much of a change and the
24:36 immediate ones over the immediate ones
24:38 over would be the most infant testable
24:40 literally the tiniest change that could
24:44 possibly be made between your universe
24:46 that you're in and the one next to you I
24:48 don't even know what that is because if
24:51 the one next to us was drastically
24:53 different than potentially the state of
24:56 the mass that exists the energy layer
24:58 that's on that would be so much
25:00 different in vibration that we wouldn't
25:02 be compatible to be next to it when you
25:05 do the Russian doll thing it's actually
25:06 fairly interesting because that's sort
25:08 of another physical analogy of a
25:10 multiverse even though it takes you know
25:12 goes smaller and gets bigger and we're
25:14 not necessarily limited by any size
25:17 constraints but what happens with the
25:20 Russian doll that's way at the center of
25:22 the Russian doll it is so teeny tiny
25:25 that the amount amount of distinction
25:27 that can be carved in that tiny one is
25:29 much smaller and then when you get to
25:30 the bigger one it has all kinds of outer
25:32 clothing and nose and face and arms and
25:34 all that kind of stuff it's not that
25:37 again we're limited by any space like
25:39 the Russian doll but the idea is to say
25:41 if you want to create a bend in the
25:44 universe in terms of its overall
25:46 vibrational signal signature it's going
25:48 to take a bunch of little iterations on
25:51 those planes of existence to ought to
25:54 acknowledge this actual change and again
25:57 I don't want you to think that the plane
25:59 actually changes shape but the data
26:01 that's on the plane our physical
26:04 instance on the plane has to be unique
26:06 in some case it's like a bunch of
26:08 records actually if you want to use the
26:10 grooves on a record you pull out a
26:13 prints album you pull out our Led
26:14 Zeppelin album and they're both black
26:16 and let's say you'll wipe the labels off
26:18 and you just look at them and you
26:19 couldn't tell the difference with your
26:21 human eye but you know if you put the
26:22 needle down on the record the vibrations
26:24 are going to be prints screaming and
26:28 Robert Plant screaming and it's gonna
26:29 sound totally different right if you
26:32 play one backwards it's kind of a prayer
26:34 to the Satan now what's interesting with
26:36 the multiverse
26:38 conversation is that one has to start
26:40 having the conversation about the
26:43 likelihood of the complexity of the
26:45 universe what is likely to be the case
26:49 when you get down to the most
26:51 fundamental particle of the universe is
26:53 it a complex particle or is it very
26:56 simple Stephen Wolfram has done a
27:00 tremendous amount of research in this
27:02 and counted well he created again if you
27:05 look at my holographic universe episode
27:09 we'll get into this in in a very deep
27:11 way but he wrote a book that
27:14 demonstrates that if you have one to two
27:16 unique particles in the universe
27:18 you get patterns when you send them into
27:21 chaos you get patterns immediately and
27:24 then if you have five or more particles
27:26 it looks pretty chaotic for a little
27:28 while but then it starts creating a
27:29 pattern I mean imagine that you have 13
27:33 particles you would think that that
27:35 would be an odd weird prime number and
27:37 it would create absolutely I don't know
27:40 satanic patterns or something I don't
27:42 know but it doesn't say satanic chaos it
27:46 doesn't it creates chaos for a little
27:48 while and then immediately turns into
27:49 patterns eventually shouldn't say
27:51 immediately but eventually turns into
27:52 patterns he found that the sweet spot of
27:55 pure chaos in the universe was to have
27:58 between 3 & 4 particles isn't that
28:02 interesting what is pi 3 point 1 4 4
28:08 interesting but we have consciousness
28:10 don't we and we've talked about
28:14 consciousness a million times on this
28:16 show right if I told you a million times
28:17 don't exaggerate scientists do not
28:21 accept mystery very well they don't
28:23 accept the unknown very well and they
28:28 it's like it's like Faraday who
28:31 discovered the ether o winds and then
28:35 spent 35 years trying to figure out what
28:37 they were
28:37 he spent 35 years trying to control it
28:42 and play with it
28:43 Tesla being the first gentleman who
28:45 really harnessed it properly but Tesla
28:49 said our sorry Faraday said at the end
28:51 of his life
28:52 as I've had it quoted in a book I do not
28:55 need to know why a steak dinner tastes
28:57 good in order to enjoy it and I
28:59 therefore do not need to know exactly
29:01 how a thorough wins work but I can enjoy
29:06 them he had the courage to accept the
29:09 unknown for what it was scientists today
29:13 can solve nearly all the problems when
29:15 they buy propaganda right propaganda
29:17 solves a lot of problems in science
29:19 because they we just all [ __ ]
29:20 ourselves right there's a lot of that in
29:24 science today and when it comes to
29:27 consciousness again we talk about the
29:31 fact that you can open up a mind
29:32 literally open up the top of the skull
29:34 poke around on the brain people getting
29:35 memories again and they're laughing and
29:37 they're feeling cry or whatever and so
29:39 scientists think oh my gosh it's all
29:41 right here look what happens when I mess
29:43 with this vessel I get all these
29:46 emotions out for those that are doing
29:48 impale chair programs and
29:50 compartmentalizing you know Manchurian
29:53 candidates boy they think they really
29:55 have it figured out all they're doing is
29:58 playing with a vessel controlling how
30:01 well the soul can talk to the body and
30:05 exude itself at some point the body is a
30:10 mechanical device it is it is full of
30:12 trends and tons of chemicals that flow
30:14 at a particular rate when they design
30:16 drugs to give us certain feelings these
30:20 chemists understand so well the mind
30:23 that they can create designer drugs to
30:25 give us all kinds of moly trips and all
30:27 kinds of stuff by studying what nature
30:29 did with mushrooms the fungus it was at
30:34 LSD is drawn from the mold from rye
30:36 bread or something like that so to go
30:39 one step further into this science
30:41 fiction realm of the whole thing to the
30:43 point where you might slip and find
30:44 yourself in a different universe I
30:47 believe it was Ryker was in the
30:51 fictional character Reichel Ryker Ryker
30:54 wrecker from Star Trek next generation
30:58 he was slipping through the quantum
31:00 vibrations of multiple realities where
31:02 you know different people were married
31:04 different people had
31:06 is he was he was a captain in one realm
31:08 and he was the first whatever the hell
31:12 he is in in the normal realm and the
31:15 idea was that his consciousness was
31:17 transferring to the next layer of the
31:20 carrier wave which obviously would cause
31:23 a tremendous disruption to whoever was
31:26 in his that previous universe before he
31:28 gets there so everyone would have to
31:30 playing you know musical chairs right
31:32 for him to take over the consciousness
31:34 of another body that body would have to
31:37 lose its consciousness and where does
31:38 that go again you can't hide anything in
31:40 the universe you can just move it that's
31:42 about it but for the sake of science
31:44 fiction they lifted that fact and let us
31:48 live in the suspension of disbelief and
31:50 they did a brilliant job other shows
31:53 we'll take the multiverse theory and say
31:56 that you can actually swap consciousness
32:00 you can move it if you're dead in
32:04 universe one and alive in universe -
32:07 then there's nothing keeping you from
32:09 moving into universe one if you can take
32:12 okay the signature of your body and
32:15 bring it into that of the universe not
32:18 duplicating anything now there's plenty
32:21 of energy to go around in all universes
32:23 so that the ideas as long as you're not
32:24 stepping into a mountain you should be
32:27 able to which you probably could but
32:29 you'd be frozen
32:30 you could probably bring your mass
32:32 signature your vibrational mass
32:34 signature into the other universe and
32:36 just simply put yourself somewhere where
32:39 there's enough room for your body to
32:41 exist I cover a lot of this at my
32:43 time-travel episode in season 1 which if
32:46 any of you dig this conversation it's
32:49 it's a pretty good pretty good episode
32:51 now for those of you who understand
32:54 computers is a very interesting sidenote
32:56 to this whole thing and the side note
32:59 would be we make copies of software
33:02 don't we what is a copy of software well
33:06 it's a medium by which we maybe call a
33:09 hard drive or an SSD some little RAM
33:12 stick right and we duplicate the bits
33:16 over to the other device and there you
33:18 go you have a copy of Microsoft
33:20 when they pressed lp's I had a copy of
33:23 Led Zeppelin album one you do too well
33:26 it's because the medium which is the wax
33:27 has been duplicated from the master
33:29 we don't conceive of the universe doing
33:33 duplicates between instances it just is
33:36 if this if this is has any true that in
33:39 it at all right but the idea is with a
33:42 science fiction side of things when you
33:43 want to put yourself in another universe
33:45 you most likely would be copying your
33:47 bits from your universe into that new
33:50 universe whether or not your old
33:51 universe has had the bits erased is up
33:55 to whatever device you might be using
33:56 rain so you see how quickly one could
34:02 convolute the process now what
34:05 scientists typically try to do is create
34:07 some sort of mechanical necessity with
34:11 these theories so you put everything on
34:13 the table it's like a brainstorming
34:15 session of how this multiverse could
34:16 work and then you start to apply to it
34:20 some sort of connection of imperative
34:22 behavior well what has to happen to
34:28 create our reality well we'd have to
34:31 degree on what are we are we simply a
34:34 bunch of vibrating ether particles and
34:37 consciousness is just a complete
34:39 illusion like a lot of scientists
34:40 cowered into but tell you a story that I
34:43 told a long time ago and it's drawn from
34:48 the history of one of the best science
34:49 fiction writers on planet Earth who has
34:51 now passed in philip k dick philip k
34:56 dick was a very humble man who was not
34:59 exactly the most happy man on planet
35:01 earth which is why he wrote some of the
35:04 more McCobb science fiction darker
35:07 science fiction he wrote the book Do
35:10 Androids Dream of Electric Sheep that
35:13 led to Hampton Fincher creating the
35:15 movie Blade Runner philip k dick and his
35:18 personal life had an event occur where
35:21 some evangelists came to his door trying
35:23 to bring him into christianity of which
35:25 he had nothing to do with and he said
35:27 that the girl was wearing a crucifix a
35:28 shiny crucifix and the Sun shined off
35:32 that crucifix into
35:33 his face and he said he at that point he
35:36 started seeing the river of information
35:38 the river of all knowledge he did not
35:43 attribute it to anything Christian he
35:44 just simply said the light itself was
35:47 the key which is very interesting
35:49 because if you think about the the
35:52 actual physicality of what he's talking
35:54 about he's getting him a very
35:56 concentrated overexposure of his retina
35:59 from Sun which when you translated all
36:01 the way back to what that means super
36:03 high frequency nailed his brain and
36:05 opened it up I will bring to your
36:08 attention that the fabled Nostradamus
36:10 said that he stared into the the light
36:13 of a candle flame isn't that interesting
36:17 he's in the dark he's staring enough at
36:19 the light of a candle flame and light
36:23 was where he gained his information I
36:27 think about all these elite that run the
36:29 world and how they worship the Sun they
36:32 worship light for enlightenment right
36:35 Illuminati to be illuminated it's very
36:38 interesting Phil kaduk continued with
36:41 the fact that when he was writing and
36:43 this happens to all of us believe it or
36:44 not you don't have to have light and
36:46 Philip didn't say he used light after
36:48 that point but he said that he would be
36:50 at his typewriter typing and if he
36:53 needed the story to exist he would look
36:55 off to the side and stare in some pocket
36:59 make his vision go sixty thousand yards
37:02 which means the focal point of his focus
37:04 was way beyond where he is staring and
37:07 all of a sudden it started showing up
37:10 this is what I've said several times in
37:12 this show which is that Michael Jackson
37:15 said I just listened to music finished
37:17 and then I go and play it I do the same
37:19 thing I'm sure a lot of you do when I
37:21 write a movie I let it play in my brain
37:23 and then I just type it in it's amazing
37:26 and if I see a scene that doesn't really
37:27 connect with my film I'll just say to
37:31 the universe that's not what I'm looking
37:32 for do another search do another you
37:34 know enhance enhance write but there was
37:38 a very key thing you know there's a
37:39 reason why I'm telling you this because
37:40 it is
37:42 at the heart of what we are and trying
37:45 to make the decisions about how to
37:47 decipher and create some mechanical
37:51 imperative about how the universe could
37:53 work based on what we have observed we
37:55 must create a system by which everything
37:57 that we have experienced as human beings
37:59 is accounted for in the model okay he
38:03 said he was lying down on a sofa just
38:05 taking a nap and his wife was in the
38:08 kitchen with his brand-new baby boy and
38:11 he had another light experience the son
38:12 went through some crystal or something
38:14 that was hanging in his window and it
38:17 hit him right in the face same exact
38:19 experience that he had with the
38:21 evangelists that came with the crucifix
38:23 except for this time he got an extremely
38:25 clear vision of his son's belly and his
38:30 son's intestines being twisted in some
38:34 potentially lethal way and it scared the
38:38 living crap out of him because he got
38:40 the clear signal your son is going to
38:43 die if this doesn't get fixed and you
38:45 need to get it fixed right away being
38:48 the good father that he was he jumps up
38:50 from this sofa he's a six foot three guy
38:52 runs in the kitchen grabs his child from
38:56 his wife and says we got to go to the ER
38:58 right now and of course she's like what
39:00 are you talking about he's like he's got
39:02 this problem he's got this problem could
39:04 you imagine if you've ever had a spouse
39:08 someone running in and doing this to you
39:10 especially you ladies out there you
39:11 imagine your husband running in and
39:12 being so certain that your child has an
39:14 obstruction in their belly how's that
39:18 possible this is not what we acknowledge
39:20 in the universe as being possible to
39:21 know so he looks like a maniac
39:23 they take the child to the ER he
39:26 explains to the doctors the obstruction
39:29 he not only does that but he uses the
39:31 Latin terms of all of the anatomy inside
39:35 like medical terms something he doesn't
39:38 know prior to this light flash in his
39:40 face okay they do a sonogram on the
39:44 child they find out he's completely
39:47 correct they do an emergency surgery and
39:50 remove the obstruction the child's fine
39:52 little tiny scar on his belly
39:55 I'd love to meet this kid and say it
39:57 show me the scar the doctors come out
39:59 and tell his father or tell Philippa
40:02 dick I should say how did you knew that
40:05 and more importantly how did you know
40:09 about all the actual organs you told us
40:11 exactly as if you were a fellow surgeon
40:13 what we should do
40:15 I said consequently your son wouldn't
40:17 have died in the next day or two but
40:19 your son might have passed away within
40:21 the next month and a half or so you
40:23 hadn't really reached a completely
40:24 volatile level but it was real and it
40:26 was exactly where you said and he
40:29 explained the situation
40:30 they got documented now when scientists
40:34 are sitting around at the table trying
40:36 to explain what we are so they can take
40:38 all these multiverse theories and try to
40:41 figure out okay we are simply the
40:43 vibrations of the fabric of the universe
40:45 perhaps ether all particles if they're
40:47 able to extend their minds back to the
40:49 masters of the universe they won't
40:51 necessarily have enough information to
40:54 explain consciousness because chemicals
40:58 in the brain knowing about a belly of a
41:01 child that doesn't make any sense
41:04 there's an extra information wave that
41:08 comes with consciousness there just is
41:11 you know for those of you who have heard
41:13 my story about meaning Walt Disney at
41:15 nausea it's one of those situations I
41:18 went to Disneyland while Disney walks up
41:20 to me he's been dead for 50 years
41:23 fifty-five years he tells me where Bob
41:26 gurus' in the park another Imagineer
41:27 that he personally hired I walked
41:29 straight to the pen and the map in my
41:31 brain and Bob is standing there with his
41:33 buddy I got my girlfriend we talked and
41:36 that was it I walked off there's an
41:40 extra carrier wave of information that
41:42 is part of the fundamental fabric of
41:45 this universe that must be accounted for
41:47 in into any model of a multiverse a
41:51 little footnote when you have crows
41:55 around your house then they get a bunch
41:57 of noise if you want to get rid of them
41:58 little Kansas trick for you you walk up
42:01 to them and you wave your arms and as
42:04 long as they see you wave your arms they
42:06 think you're a bird way bigger than them
42:08 and
42:08 laughs out of town it's really funny so
42:11 that's what I did to get rid of crows
42:12 he's moved down the block here but
42:16 here's what's fascinating about this
42:17 notion we on deep thoughts will upgrade
42:20 our definition of what the universe is
42:22 by simply acknowledging that which is
42:25 unexplained by science and so we know
42:28 that we exist right you can touch
42:30 yourself and this may be all a
42:31 simulation or whatever it doesn't matter
42:33 it doesn't change the fact that we're in
42:34 a matrix or on a computer memory what is
42:37 happening is that we have these
42:39 different layers of existence so now
42:43 take the sine cosine wave and say that
42:45 is our frequency of existence our method
42:49 by which we have tangibility the fact
42:52 that I could push this camera over if I
42:54 wanted to with my hand because I could
42:55 touch the tripod I can actually touch
42:57 the tripod that is the base frequency
43:00 but the notion that we can hivemind our
43:03 thinking is huge one of the fascinating
43:07 things about the current state of
43:10 politics and the current state of all
43:13 events that are occurring right now is
43:14 that I've created episodes for two years
43:16 on deep thoughts my ability to hide mine
43:22 and predict this stuff years ahead of
43:23 time has helped me relax when I see the
43:27 new information I go wow that's what I
43:29 said in an episode a year ago two years
43:30 ago it's cool and I see folks that I
43:33 know that don't watch the show I'll make
43:36 them I'll make a show and then two weeks
43:38 later I'll see someone on Twitter laser
43:41 in on the subject matter that I think is
43:43 you know I don't hear anyone else
43:44 talking about that's why I made a show
43:45 about it someone in their video channel
43:48 their vlog on YouTube will start talking
43:51 about it
43:51 there's a carrier wave that we design as
43:55 human beings all consciousness designs
43:58 the carrier wave and the reason why I
43:59 think this works is the following
44:02 imagine an assembly line where you have
44:06 something coming by you constantly and
44:09 you can you're not going to add anything
44:11 to it you're not going to subtract
44:12 anything - but what you're gonna do is
44:14 configure it it's got a bunch of dip
44:16 switches or some sort of I don't know
44:19 blocks up and down little pins
44:22 that you can play with and you put your
44:25 thought process on it and it changes the
44:27 configuration of that packet of
44:28 information then that peck of
44:30 information travels on this carrier wave
44:32 of reality to the next person down
44:34 whether it be someone in bed with you or
44:36 someone million miles from you different
44:39 planet right they may not consciously
44:43 know the packet has been delivered to
44:45 them with your new information but it
44:48 gets given to them on a subconscious
44:50 level they have no choice but to
44:53 subconsciously react to that information
44:54 and put their little changes on their a
44:57 little Delta and that gets handed down
45:00 to the next person it's being carried on
45:02 this wave that is the basis of the
45:06 universe's fabric that might be the
45:09 method by which we hive mind that might
45:13 be why the hundred monkey which is also
45:16 called the ten monkey experiment works
45:17 where you teach one monkey how to do
45:19 something put him back in his habitat
45:21 with a bunch of other monkeys and you
45:23 can pull a monkey out of the habitat
45:24 that hasn't had any direct contact with
45:26 that monkey and he seems to know what
45:28 the first one knew now let's take that
45:30 one step further if the velocity of
45:34 which these these informational packets
45:37 of well that we actually it recognizes
45:38 consciousness exists which I think we
45:41 have proven something exists in addition
45:44 to the very fabric of our physicality
45:47 then the question is is there any speed
45:50 limit to how fast these packets can
45:52 travel I'm gonna say if there is a speed
45:57 limit it is really really high you know
46:01 I mentioned it a long long time ago but
46:02 when Elvis Presley was in a car accident
46:04 as a young man out on tour he got a call
46:08 from his mother very quickly as soon as
46:10 he got to the next stopping place and
46:12 she said honey I have a really bad
46:14 feeling are you okay and he said it's
46:17 funny mom because I just got in a car
46:19 accident I'm fine everything's great I
46:21 had the same thing happened to me first
46:23 car accident I ever had in California a
46:25 guy rear-ended me and rolled his car and
46:27 also there's stuff I got home that night
46:29 and while I was dealing with the car
46:32 wreck my mom had called my house on that
46:34 to voicemail
46:36 my recorder wondering if I was okay cuz
46:39 she had a weird feeling instantaneous
46:42 transfer in fact my mom may have called
46:44 technically speaking half an hour before
46:46 the event occurred isn't that
46:49 interesting
46:50 there's the Mandela effect which I want
46:53 to bring into this I think some Mandela
46:56 facts are laughable and I think others
46:58 are remarkable it could be just a again
47:03 if there's any explanation for it that
47:05 is outside of what I'm about to
47:06 acknowledge about it it would be that we
47:09 had a catastrophic failure in education
47:11 or promotion that got us thinking the
47:14 wrong thing meaning a piece of history
47:19 was written wrong or taught wrong by a
47:20 bunch of teachers you know Eli Whitney
47:23 being a white guy instead of a black guy
47:25 I mean it really it's a it's a black guy
47:27 it was taught to a lot of us and he's
47:30 into being a white guy from you things
47:32 like Luke I'm your father could have
47:35 been a mistake with some fans who quoted
47:37 it incorrectly including James Earl
47:41 Jones who said the line getting it wrong
47:43 for thirty years after he did the scene
47:45 could have been a revising the script
47:47 and he just forgot which one actually
47:49 was the one that was used so he quoted
47:51 it wrong for 30 or 40 years who knows
47:54 but if it's not some anomaly that can be
47:57 explained then let me throw this at you
48:02 what if there's a situation what happens
48:04 more organically than we would ever want
48:06 to admit where remember what I said
48:10 about the the album's next to the our
48:13 album like we're on one album of our
48:15 frequency of existence with our
48:17 consciousness carrier wave on the
48:19 subwave that is the fabric of the
48:21 universe probably throw particles the
48:24 next one over can't be that much
48:25 different it just can't it has to be
48:28 literally the most infinitesimal change
48:30 that could possibly exist and let's just
48:35 say some of us remember things
48:38 differently because we're from a
48:39 different universe where that was
48:42 different that small tiny thing happened
48:44 different now I would think that Mandela
48:46 dying in nineteen ninety-three would be
48:47 anything but a minor change
48:50 but I honestly don't know how one would
48:53 quantify what would be the most minor
48:55 change but perhaps these albums and
48:57 having their own carrier wave right or
49:01 you know their sub their sub wave the
49:03 wave that carries all the the data that
49:05 is our consciousness maybe there's some
49:08 anomaly some burp maybe you mess with a
49:11 Hadron Collider and you create in really
49:14 when the Hadron Collider started
49:15 spinning up and doing its higher higher
49:17 accelerations is when the Mendell
49:19 effects showed up I hate to be
49:20 conspiratorial but if we're slamming two
49:24 protons together at some massive speed
49:26 or even just the acceleration of the
49:28 protons going you know there's two
49:30 groups going in opposite directions and
49:32 then they eventually slam them together
49:34 inside the colliders themselves maybe
49:37 that burp sends such a shockwave through
49:41 the very sub atomic carrier wave that is
49:45 our ether o winds that it throws and
49:49 casts out the informational wave which
49:53 is our consciousness and our souls and
49:55 it does in exchange with another
49:58 universe a bunch of folks that that that
50:02 live in the universe where Eli Whitney
50:04 was black that was maybe where we were
50:05 from and we got cast over to the one
50:08 where it's a white guy from you not a
50:10 major change our first names and last
50:12 names are the same our parents are the
50:14 same all of our friends are the same as
50:16 far as we've ever audited our lives
50:17 right so there could be a man-made
50:21 object that creates this bizarre shift
50:24 of consciousness and it could be an
50:26 organic thing that the universe just
50:28 simply does every once in a while some
50:29 other thing that we don't understand
50:30 about the the vibrational waves that
50:33 make us up again we must come to some
50:37 form of consensus about what we are
50:39 before we can get down to how the
50:43 universe is layered into existence and
50:45 then the advanced theory of the
50:48 multiverse on top of it
50:50 for those of you who watched my episode
50:53 on Gnosticism which by my definition is
50:59 the ability to drag information out of
51:01 the universe to the extent that you can
51:03 conceive a
51:04 the search algorithm right if you can
51:06 type in the right search algorithm in
51:08 your brain and send it out to the
51:09 universe with a certain level of
51:11 specificity you will get back that
51:13 information no there's a lot of cuts in
51:17 this show you know you guys see the
51:18 camera fade a lot if you're watching on
51:20 YouTube part of that's to keep up the
51:21 pace for the podcast cuz I only edit one
51:23 show and I take the audio and I make it
51:25 a podcast so if I'm sitting here
51:27 thinking a lot about what I'm gonna say
51:29 or I get kind of confused about okay
51:32 what did I say I was gonna follow up on
51:33 or whatever I cut all those out but one
51:36 of the things I do very rarely but it
51:38 happens probably about every five
51:40 episodes or so is I will try to come up
51:43 with a name I'm trying to reference
51:44 somebody's name or reference a movie or
51:46 reference something from my my memory
51:48 and I don't have it on the tip of my
51:50 tongue and so what I do is I sit I quiet
51:52 my mind and I say out loud the search
51:56 algorithm that I'm looking for like what
51:57 is the name of that guy again that did
51:59 oh yeah Kurt Russell whatever it is and
52:01 I get the information back from the
52:03 universe it's amazing as if they are
52:04 listening as long as I put it out there
52:07 and it's probably not literally that
52:08 case but I think that without sending
52:11 out the search algorithm the universe
52:12 can't help you it's not going to send
52:13 you all the data of the universe just
52:15 because you exist that would drive you
52:17 crazy right when the god particle was
52:22 designated by cern again it is not most
52:29 likely true what they came up with was
52:31 ABS line for everyone
52:34 hounding them and and remember when they
52:36 said they found the god particle all the
52:38 pressure came off the Hadron Collider
52:39 what they are doing with the had drunk
52:41 liar isn't even published anymore in the
52:43 mainstream press nobody cares because
52:45 they gave us this line of BS but you had
52:49 to phd's young guys who one was looking
52:52 for the more stable particle and one was
52:54 looking for the more chaotic particle
52:56 one being the multiverse and one being
52:59 covered this I guess you would call
53:00 singleton universe right but when they
53:04 designated this frequency came exactly
53:06 between the two guys they said the
53:11 multiverse side was happy the singleton
53:14 universe guys were like oh my gosh
53:15 what's you know it's really disturbing
53:17 up
53:18 this frequency that they said they found
53:20 was that that means the universe could
53:22 come undone really easily this whole
53:26 thing could just fizzle away because
53:28 unstable god particle means chaos could
53:31 ensue they never really talked about you
53:35 know what event could possibly occur in
53:37 the universe to create this chaos for
53:40 the average non-scientific person who's
53:44 interested in this stuff that kind of
53:46 feedback is actually I think very toxic
53:49 for the mind we don't want to have
53:52 people run around saying the universe
53:53 could just simply not exist all of a
53:55 sudden not that you be around to worry
53:57 about it but as I have said several
53:59 times on the show I think the universe
54:02 is an extremely stable and perfect thing
54:06 because we can see very easily that the
54:10 universe has been around for a while but
54:12 I don't care how you believe it to be
54:14 created I don't care what shape you
54:15 think it is it's been around for a very
54:18 long time so the hubris of mankind these
54:21 PhDs that would come out and say oh my
54:24 god because I have can created a concern
54:26 for myself out of theoretical BS I now
54:30 have a panic I can write about there is
54:34 a a great passage that is typically
54:38 missed in the Hitchhiker's Guide at the
54:39 galaxy when the deep thoughts deep
54:42 thoughts a computer was built and it
54:44 said it was gonna need I think 11
54:46 million years to think about the answer
54:48 to life the universe and everything and
54:49 they they protested and they said you
54:51 know why is it gonna take so long and
54:54 this is ridiculous we built you to be
54:56 the most powerful computer in the world
54:57 and you shouldn't have to take this long
54:59 to get it to work to get the answer I
55:02 should say and deep thought again this
55:05 is the mind of Douglas Adams right this
55:08 guy was so ahead of his time it is
55:11 really mind-blowing
55:12 he wrote the computer to say what you
55:17 need to do is is create a debate in the
55:21 world for the next 11 million years
55:23 about what I'm going to actually say
55:26 after I figure out what the answer is
55:28 and you can make you get on the lecture
55:31 circuit
55:31 says you can make millions of dollars
55:33 right and the two philosophers had
55:36 broken into the computer lab and said we
55:38 want this computer shut off because our
55:39 job is to think about this answer and if
55:42 your computer just comes out and says
55:43 what the answer is all the philosophers
55:45 of the world are out of a job the deep
55:48 thought talked him into relaxing and
55:50 saying look you were the guy who's gonna
55:51 make the most money because you're gonna
55:52 debate about this there's a reason why
55:55 Douglas Adams saw that as a joke because
55:58 even in his life in the late 70s in the
56:01 1970s he had seen this over and over and
56:04 over again in the scientific community
56:05 and I am sure that he had someone
56:11 whisper to him that this is what we do
56:13 for a living we create panic and then we
56:16 philosophize about the panic of our
56:19 theories to the public who are just
56:21 sheep because they don't educate
56:23 themselves in science we got him by the
56:26 balls we could terrify them with a
56:29 meteor strike that might be happening
56:31 you know I think I've said several times
56:34 on the show I spend a good probably 15
56:38 years of my life studying everything
56:41 black holes because it was an extremely
56:43 fascinating theory to me as a very young
56:45 man and I carried that into my 20s I've
56:49 written the equivalent of a thesis a PhD
56:53 thesis on this for a friend of mine he
56:55 went to high school and she got an A by
56:58 the way and you had two schools of
57:01 thought you had the individuals that
57:02 studied the black hole in great detail
57:04 the theory of it which again was
57:06 dismissed in late 80s early 90s as an
57:09 object that would diffuse as soon as it
57:10 was created and all sudden again it just
57:12 shows up and now it's at the center of
57:14 everything but you had the lighter
57:16 scientists around the fringe of this
57:18 thing sort of like you're Bill Nye
57:19 douchebag guys trying to create the
57:22 hysteria that a black hole could show up
57:25 out of nowhere and suck up the universe
57:28 and destroy it if the Hadron Collider is
57:30 creating Mendell effects then I think
57:33 that's something we have to be cognitive
57:35 and perhaps even I would say not as so
57:43 much as protests but we should really
57:46 pass this conversation on and say this
57:49 is why we think that if it is a
57:53 multiverse model that you can't just
57:56 turn on a gigantic Hadron Collider a
58:00 giant accelerator and slammed things
58:01 together because you were creating
58:03 shockwaves in the very fabric of the
58:06 universe that is is transferring the
58:12 consciousness wave on the carrier wave
58:14 you're tossing us around the universe
58:17 and you have no right to do so can you
58:20 imagine a Mendell effect that is more
58:22 acute let's say they they do more
58:25 experiments with a Hadron Collider let's
58:27 just go down this theory for a little
58:28 while and they slam it so hard that one
58:34 of you wakes up and you're single but
58:39 you're married with three kids and you
58:42 wake up and there are no more children
58:46 the love of your life your best friend
58:48 that you so were so fortunate to find is
58:51 gone pretty terrifying right and I don't
58:55 mean to contribute to the terror of
58:56 these theories but it's something we
59:00 would have to consider but since the
59:02 average person is unable to explain
59:03 their concerns or even know that this is
59:06 a threat to their life we have to do our
59:09 best to help people understand what
59:12 could potentially be the case right but
59:14 now let's talk about the positive
59:16 potential of this whole thing if we can
59:21 acknowledge what we really are and
59:24 acknowledge that as a much more expanded
59:26 definition of what we previously thought
59:28 we were in that information in the
59:31 universe is fully accessible as long as
59:34 you know what you're looking for then it
59:38 could be a much more powerful place for
59:40 you to be for those of you haven't seen
59:42 my episode on remote viewing
59:44 remote viewing may be nothing more than
59:47 the actual conscious training of the
59:49 mind to expand into the multiverse world
59:51 again not necessarily concerned about
59:54 the parallel universe but you are then
59:57 acknowledging the information way
59:59 that goes on top of the carrier wave and
60:01 when people say I want to see into this
60:03 place in the world I want to know what's
60:05 in that envelope I want to know what's
60:06 inside that hanger they're merely
60:08 creating a search algorithm which is the
60:10 way they teach them they even give them
60:12 GPS coordinates and say what do you
60:14 think you see at this GPS coordinate
60:16 they start to see they don't let them
60:18 know where the GPS coordinate is it
60:20 could be in the tomb of King Tut it
60:23 could be in some hanger in Russia and
60:25 they immediately start talking about
60:27 what they think they see and there's no
60:28 input it's the coldest reading that
60:30 could possibly create to create the most
60:32 accurate reading for those of us who
60:35 have been accused of having natural
60:37 talent and I hope every single one of
60:39 you have been accused of such a thing
60:41 you know what it's like with Anat you've
60:45 itemized it your past there was
60:47 something by which you looked at
60:50 something and you what they call grok
60:53 did you completely understood it in a
60:56 very split-second moment of time for
60:59 some of you it might have been getting
61:01 on your first motocross motorcycle and
61:02 for whatever reason your brain
61:04 completely assessed its mechanical
61:07 abilities its thresholds I can do this I
61:10 can't do that
61:10 my body must be integrated into the
61:13 vehicle like this but not like that when
61:15 I jump 40 feet in the air
61:16 I must relax these muscles intense these
61:19 muscles upon landing I must do a
61:20 different thing and you're natural at it
61:23 for those of you have walked up to a
61:25 piano and played it there's all these
61:26 kids and around the world before autism
61:28 ever existed okay you have you have what
61:32 they would what they had termed in the
61:34 past is mentally [ __ ] children right
61:37 just a little slower in thinking some of
61:39 them blind there was a really famous kid
61:40 in the 70s it was blind and he would
61:42 walk up to a piano and start playing it
61:44 automatically no lessons he play and
61:46 he'd sing they'd never seen the ivories
61:49 in his entire life but he just rocked it
61:53 he just saw it the Gnostic wave of the
61:56 universe that carrier wave of
61:57 information allowed him to do it I told
62:01 a story a long time ago about I used to
62:03 write a lot of music in the nighties for
62:07 myself and for video games and all this
62:08 other stuff and I remember one day I
62:10 used to keep my studio always on
62:11 keyboards on
62:13 sequencer loaded and so I could just
62:14 walk in my office my Studios slash
62:17 office and immediately play something
62:20 and I remember sitting down and having
62:22 the urge to play and I couldn't I could
62:25 come up with anything nothing not a
62:26 chord progression nothing so I went out
62:29 and laid out in the Sun I did thirty
62:31 minutes on my back thirty minutes on my
62:33 stomach I came in I was sweaty and I was
62:36 just gonna go to the shower but
62:37 something told me going to the studio
62:39 and I sat down and I played it a
62:42 two-handed song two chords you know bass
62:46 chord and the primary melody chord and I
62:49 started singing lyrics that I'd never
62:50 heard before I recorded it I got down
62:54 one version of the track took a shower
62:56 came back created three versions of the
62:58 song like an acapella version a
63:01 full-blown kind of you know funky
63:04 version and then a more ballad version
63:05 of it recorded on a cassette to consume
63:08 my girlfriend handed it off and that was
63:11 it but that thing came out of thin air
63:13 out of nowhere no premeditated chords
63:17 that I've been working on the weeks
63:18 prior no lyrics that I had pushed into
63:20 to poetry and at that time I was
63:23 probably writing a lyric a slash poem
63:26 every single day of my life back in
63:29 those days never heard these lines
63:31 before other than the Mendell effects I
63:34 which obviously is yet to be you know
63:37 completely validated I don't know how
63:39 one validates it I have personally seen
63:42 no evidence of a multiverse the universe
63:45 that we are in is more fascinating than
63:47 I think any of us acknowledge perhaps on
63:52 this show we do a better job so I'm
63:55 interested to see and hear what your
63:57 thoughts are if you have other videos
63:58 that are interesting to this please post
64:00 them in the comments I want to say a
64:02 little footnote if you do post a video
64:05 links sometimes it's hell for moderation
64:07 just because of YouTube's you know kind
64:10 of automated moderating systems so if
64:12 you post your video link and you don't
64:15 see it in the comments don't panic I
64:17 will get to it and get it out there the
64:19 only thing I don't allow is like hey man
64:21 you should listen to my music video you
64:23 know by the way we have some
64:25 listeners who are incredible musicians
64:28 my god one of our listeners you know
64:30 everyone small sends me a music video of
64:32 are not really music video but a lyric
64:34 video of one of his old songs and this
64:36 one acknowledged publicly incredible
64:39 incredible music it's amazing so if you
64:43 haven't been a deep thoughts radio calm
64:44 please go all the links are there the
64:46 video the audio the lock facebook group
64:48 and the patreon page for those of you
64:50 contributing to patreon thank you so
64:51 much I'm going to be again once I start
64:55 seeing the notifications go out to you
64:56 guys on patreon you know I'm putting the
64:59 videos up there first and so you get a
65:01 chance to hear the the Youtube version
65:03 of it first there's no way for me to
65:06 publish secretly the the podcast so I
65:08 can't give those of you could rip it up
65:10 on our patreon the podcast first if I
65:14 put a video out there and no one's
65:17 getting notifications that with within
65:18 probably about 12 hours I'll let it go
65:20 out to the public but just in case for
65:22 those of you who visit back take a look
65:24 again I'm gonna be putting some other
65:25 content there's already some stuff up
65:27 there photos of kind of what it looks
65:29 like my little setup here as well as an
65:33 old comic video I made a long time ago
65:34 goes up there so I'm gonna be pushing
65:37 some pretty cool stuff up there but
65:38 again thank you so much for supporting
65:40 the show please thumbs up because that
65:43 gates a greats a viral thing for us I
65:45 would say that if any of you dig the
65:48 series in general and you can go
65:50 backwards in thumb up old videos that'll
65:52 also help just your viewing minutes and
65:55 you're viewing counts obviously really
65:58 really help the more conversation that
66:00 goes on in each video I think that
66:01 actually helps the algorithm as well our
66:03 subscriptions are going up which is
66:06 fantastic because we haven't had any
66:08 sort of lowbrow videos that are you know
66:10 like if I do a flat earth one it spikes
66:12 like crazy I haven't doing that stuff
66:13 for a while so it's going up on its own
66:16 merits which is very cool so anyway I
66:18 hope you're having a great day I'll see
66:20 you next time take care of yourself in
66:22 someone else over
