00:30 welcome to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen on this beautiful warm March
00:35 day in California
00:37 it must be 78 where I'm sitting right
00:41 now is absolutely perfect it is ideal so
00:44 I'm talking to one of our patreon this
00:49 person is incredibly intriguing to me
00:50 because she said to me something that I
00:56 think that few people and I mean few
01:00 people notice and we're talking 1% of 1%
01:05 of 1% it was astonishing to read her
01:09 words because I just don't hear anyone
01:13 at this level of consciousness it's
01:18 something that I've mentioned in the
01:19 past and a couple passings and I even I
01:22 was struggling to figure out how to
01:23 articulate what the deal was it has to
01:28 do with reality it has to do with maybe
01:37 in some cases the Mandela effect but I'm
01:41 not sure that what's going on is what we
01:45 think is going on anymore but it's much
01:48 more interesting than just a matrix or
01:51 something like that it's much more
01:52 interesting in my opinion it feels to me
01:56 as if perhaps this reality is nothing
01:59 more than a dream I know that's a
02:01 trivial thing to say in some camps but
02:04 bear with me here this particular dream
02:08 has quite a few senses and so when we go
02:12 to bed in this reality and we have a
02:14 dream within this reality it is one of a
02:19 subset it just reminds me the old George
02:22 Carlin routine where he said you know
02:24 when you go on vacation you have to grab
02:26 some of your stuff from where you live
02:28 and take it to where you're going and
02:29 then if you happen to venture away from
02:32 the hotel to stay a day in some other
02:34 location you have to take another
02:37 smaller piece of you
02:38 stuff so it's like the Russian doll
02:40 routine and so to me this reality
02:45 although very vivid it has physical pain
02:48 and and what have you when you go into
02:53 the subset of the set you get a lighter
02:57 version of it with less senses but
03:02 that's not even the purpose of this
03:03 episode the purpose of this episode is
03:05 that I as I become more aware I don't
03:11 know if it's as a result of doing a show
03:13 I can't really say that I have any deep
03:15 conversations in person like I'm having
03:19 a deeper conversation on a patreon chat
03:21 than I am right now anywhere else that
03:25 I'm having some great conversations but
03:29 here's the thing and I'm going to try to
03:30 say this in a way that makes instant
03:32 sense
03:33 I remember multiple instances of my past
03:41 we're not talking about previous lives
03:43 talk about this one I have memories of
03:48 the world being very very very different
03:52 and when I say very different the
03:56 architecture like everywhere I went was
03:59 different we were different as people
04:02 and not just the whole thing that we all
04:05 know that in the seventies we were goofy
04:06 at dance disco fifties there was
04:09 something else and this is as if the the
04:14 very artistic method by which we built
04:19 society and built reality was different
04:22 and it is so Mandela effects are little
04:26 tiny changes where Eli Whitney is now a
04:28 white guy from Yale who never picked
04:30 cotton in his life versus the black a
04:32 southerner that most of us remember who
04:35 picked cotton and through doing so and
04:37 looking at other machinery around him
04:39 figured out how to make wires bang into
04:42 cotton blooms and tangled them up into a
04:47 machine that they could scrape them off
04:48 and you could harvest cotton out of
04:50 these trees
04:51 one doesn't make any sense one makes
04:54 sense but if you were raised with the
04:57 white yo guy you think we're nuts for
04:59 remembering the black guy and vice versa
05:02 I think that there are most certainly
05:05 echoes of these worlds that I can
05:11 remember these these it's almost like a
05:14 paint job and a theme that was
05:16 completely different and I'll give you
05:20 an example when I gave you some specific
05:21 examples there's one that I saw the
05:24 other day and this is where it gets
05:26 almost like an Easter egg hunt it's
05:28 really really weird but it's kind of
05:31 exciting at the same time now what I
05:33 have said in the past is it that I will
05:35 be driving either down the highway or
05:39 driving in Los Angeles and I will turn a
05:41 corner and whatever is happening there's
05:44 an echo of my previous reality again I
05:50 don't know if it's previous life you
05:52 know I think we have one soul life and
05:55 many vessel lifes but I will be driving
05:59 down the street and especially the
06:01 highways here and then if foliage is in
06:03 a particular configuration and the this
06:06 am an overpass is very nice and
06:09 optimized not a kind of a run-down
06:11 graffiti'd one the whole world feels
06:15 different for three to five seconds and
06:19 it's like I'm going back and living in
06:21 that other reality and it's here's the
06:23 interesting thing
06:23 this one sucks and the other ones are
06:27 amazing this one sucks because people
06:30 are greedy and evil from time to time
06:35 right and in the other world we've all
06:38 balanced out it's almost as if for
06:40 traveling like I'm travelling like hell
06:42 I don't know two three four thousand
06:44 years in the future for whatever reason
06:46 we love cars and we've just kind of
06:49 figured it out genetically the only
06:50 reason why but fancy time is that it
06:52 feels like we figured it out now give
06:56 you some examples this is where
06:58 hopefully some of you get triggered into
07:00 your memories as well and I'm not trying
07:03 to brainwash anyone into this belief
07:04 system
07:05 but she said that she had this I don't
07:09 even know if what I'm describing is
07:10 exactly what she said but it seems
07:14 pretty close there was a point in Prince
07:17 princes career the artist known as
07:20 Prince when he was on the Purple Reign
07:23 tour he had this guitar made which was a
07:28 big deal in the next album a which is
07:31 around the world in a day but it's sort
07:33 of this Roman column I don't know it
07:40 almost feels like the guitar is from the
07:42 world that I remember and Rome is
07:47 copying it strange I'm gonna find this
07:50 video there's a blender artist who
07:54 created as really cool animation using
07:58 green screens in his little home but he
08:01 created like this full-blown Space
08:05 Station black sauna it's actually on
08:07 earth but it's it's as futuristic
08:08 apartment that goes out to the balcony
08:10 as this woman as an actress goes not to
08:12 a balcony and you know ships are flying
08:14 by and also the crazies and stuff
08:16 brilliantly done but there is a I think
08:20 it's a century bot or something like
08:21 that that pops up in the scene and the
08:26 way that it was modeled is 100 it's dark
08:30 because I always remember these things
08:32 being really bright like did like the
08:34 prints guitar because he did like
08:35 different colors of it the white one is
08:37 the one that really rings this tone back
08:40 to this world in the point of the whole
08:43 thing is this when we're trying to
08:47 figure out why a bunch of us remember
08:50 things completely different in various
08:55 regions of the world my my current take
08:58 was that it was consensus reality right
09:00 America remembers Berenstein bears in
09:04 Europe they remember berenstain bears
09:05 but because we have a 300 million people
09:08 here we get to force that into reality
09:11 with our minds and so zero we would have
09:16 you know 600 million at the time
09:18 so but I thought was that jeez it feels
09:24 like life is like the whole universe is
09:28 very organic they grows it changes it
09:31 changes drastically in some cases and
09:34 minor in minor ways other cases now one
09:40 of the critiques of the sort of skeptic
09:42 Society of Mandela fact is that people
09:45 simply got it wrong and we're all just
09:51 getting corrected and the one I think
09:54 error in that philosophy is that or in
09:58 that theory is that we should still have
10:02 tons of Berenstain Bear people here in
10:04 the United States in fact the Berenstain
10:06 Bear for instance which I have no
10:08 familiar familiarity with those books at
10:10 all if you know some people get it wrong
10:14 we're still gonna have probably over 51%
10:17 that have it right and it seems like
10:20 almost categorically in America no one
10:21 remembers Berenstain because that's not
10:23 a name that we use over here Bernstein
10:26 at least sounds like names that we have
10:29 you know and there's just too many to
10:33 reference I mean you know the other big
10:35 one is the line in Empire Strikes Back
10:37 you have James Earl Jones and Mark
10:40 Hamill recreating the line as we all
10:42 remember it for 30 years and then all of
10:44 a sudden it's like no guys you both have
10:46 it wrong you read the line and acted it
10:49 voice wise and you heard it and we're
10:52 you know Mark Hamill is tormented by
10:55 that line you know what would you bigger
10:56 boat remember the time but you know Luke
11:00 I'm your father so there's just I think
11:04 there's overwhelming evidence that
11:06 something bigger is at play and why not
11:09 acknowledge it to see if there's
11:11 something there but then I'm going into
11:14 my own chamber where you know if I try
11:16 to explain last night's dream
11:19 it's very difficult to remember all of
11:22 the elements because as you dig into a
11:24 dream at least for me you dig in and
11:28 there'll be certain highlights that you
11:30 remember at nights it was so strange to
11:32 me as there will be some dreams that is
11:36 no different than me going to bed any
11:38 other night but when I wake up that
11:41 dream in particular will be so
11:45 remembered like I can remember for the
11:48 rest of my life like I have a dream
11:49 where I was going down into this Canyon
11:53 but which was cut mountains by some
11:58 alien race and it was like as if a bunch
12:01 of us humans were taken off of Earth and
12:03 we were being taken to a planet where
12:05 the aliens that lived there are gone and
12:08 we were going down into this just deep
12:11 deep cavern I could probably 3d model it
12:13 and show it you guys whatever reason
12:16 that memory and walking with people and
12:19 looking down it's almost like you're
12:20 going into a mutant park ride where
12:23 you're going to say you've been Indiana
12:25 Jones ride and Disneyland and one of the
12:27 Disney parks there's a point where
12:29 you're spiraling down to the cars and
12:31 you look down on the rest of the line it
12:32 was sort of like that but why is it that
12:35 yesterday's dream which I have little
12:38 tiny tidbit Suns if I try to begin to
12:40 describe it to you I will then have it's
12:44 almost like a cloudy apparition that
12:47 okay I can see part of the cloud right
12:50 here oh that's a little bit blue and
12:51 then as I look at the blue all sudden
12:54 Boop another part of the cloud of the
12:55 imagery of what happens the action and
12:58 why I was there oh yeah Aliyah and then
12:59 this oh and this and you know it's just
13:03 so bizarrely [ __ ] podgy you know it's
13:06 not like a linear reality that you know
13:10 I went and got chick-fil-a today and I
13:11 can tell you exactly about the drive
13:13 there how I ordered it how long it took
13:16 to get it a parking lot watch people
13:18 drive by that's easy in this reality but
13:24 could it be that this is gonna sound
13:30 nuts
13:31 I want you to think about this for a
13:34 second and again I've got friends that
13:35 say they remember I remember
13:38 probably being I remember one moment in
13:42 a crib outside my great great
13:44 grandmother's or great grandmother's
13:45 house excuse me where I couldn't speak
13:49 my mother was talking to me about men
13:51 being on the moon and I had no means of
13:54 talking back to her so I do remember
13:55 that but isn't it interesting that our
13:57 birth is something that we can't
14:00 remember it's as if we joined reality at
14:06 wherever your first memory occurs and
14:09 this is sort of a tongue-in-cheek magic
14:15 trick to say because we don't remember
14:17 our youth which honestly if you think
14:21 about it it's a very bizarre thing
14:24 you know like I've always told you guys
14:26 in the show about the age of seven there
14:29 was just a click and the day that I
14:31 really remember
14:32 remembering reality for the rest of my
14:35 life like every general quarter of every
14:38 year I was seven years old I think it
14:43 was the day that my parents said we're
14:45 gonna go see this movie star wars
14:46 I remember they said wash your hands and
14:49 get your thing to get I had no idea what
14:51 that was which is just a sunny beautiful
14:54 day and then movie was amazing and then
14:56 it was just like well the best days of
14:57 my entire lifetime I'd had a good day
15:00 and then I got to see Star Wars with a
15:02 disco ball and it receives disco ball in
15:03 my life it's amazing but you know we
15:07 have so many areas of science where
15:09 people are indoctrinating you they're
15:11 telling you what reality is I just
15:14 remember that article today about how
15:16 black holes only a thousand light years
15:18 away and you can see it with the naked
15:20 eye and it's like seriously and I'm
15:26 gonna have to listen to that stupid
15:27 article coming out of like Associates of
15:29 mine or whatever for the next quarter do
15:31 you know man ago black oh you know it's
15:34 like sheesh tell me Oh gravity is
15:37 accurately and then all this - nope too
15:42 late what's interesting about these
15:45 other places that I see and again we're
15:48 talking about
15:49 one two five seconds at five seconds
15:52 would be a super-rare long observation
15:55 of this whole thing and I do not dream
15:59 them that's another interesting thing
16:01 they all feel like I mean there's
16:04 something that has to trigger in my
16:06 environment to get me to think about it
16:08 when I watch the blender thing which I'm
16:10 gonna show you at least a frame of it he
16:14 triggered me and I was like oh that's
16:16 the reality that's the old place I used
16:18 to live there's another place that I
16:20 remember living where it was it's it's
16:25 sort of a post-nuclear
16:29 era like late fifties early sixties
16:32 beatnik
16:34 you know you have mahogany wood walls
16:37 with you know beautiful trim steel and
16:40 everything's it has the fabric if
16:43 there's a curtain the fabric is that
16:45 sparkly fabric from back in the day
16:47 really thick curtain you know but
16:49 there's also a sense of sort of a
16:51 realistic not necessarily flying cars or
16:55 anything but it's definitely a step
16:56 towards a George Jetson kind of world
16:58 which I think what's interesting about
17:02 it is you know when I first saw Tron the
17:05 movie at yes I was technically 12 years
17:09 old I couldn't describe why at the age
17:14 of 12 seeing Syd Meads artwork because
17:17 Mobius is artwork is in there as well
17:18 and I loved his stuff but it feels
17:20 present and it feels fictionally present
17:23 meaning someone in my world thought up a
17:25 really cool thing and it's just a joy to
17:27 watch like heavy metal and all that kind
17:30 of stuff right in the movie but Syd
17:32 stuff was like interdimensional or gosh
17:35 like inner reality like instead of
17:38 changing a dimension necessarily you
17:40 could call it a dimension it was like
17:42 these it's almost like if you're in
17:45 Google Earth and you can view it as a
17:49 satellite or you can put that you can
17:51 view it as a street or you can overlay
17:52 the streets on top of the satellite and
17:54 you get these different layers for those
17:56 of you remember the old King Tut books
17:58 that went around the 70s there were
18:00 these beautiful books with this vellum
18:02 and you could you can unmask the ton of
18:07 King Tut or they're shooting the tomb of
18:09 King Teti excuse me and then he pulled
18:11 the top of the lid off and it was all
18:13 this clear vellum and just print it was
18:15 Ashley Brent you get down to the cat
18:17 down to his body and it's almost as if
18:20 certain layers of reality / you know it
18:25 totally and completely replaces the
18:28 people and there's been this theory and
18:31 I have friends in mind that where this
18:34 comes up every once in a while and the
18:37 theory is is that this might be a prison
18:38 planet and it's kind of an acidic idea
18:43 to think that wherever we were before we
18:46 committed a sin
18:47 against probably each other because you
18:50 know who cares
18:51 outside of the context of of us and what
18:54 is good and what is bad and then somehow
18:59 we're banished to this world where we
19:01 tend to lose our privileges but instead
19:06 of in this particular metaphor or this
19:09 this notion this theory it is not that
19:12 you die and get pushed into this you
19:17 know you get resurrected into a new body
19:19 and you're in this prison planet called
19:21 Earth it is that you in a live-streaming
19:25 situation stream into another reality
19:30 that is full of more challenges and more
19:36 strife and less privilege less success
19:38 by any man's definition to mankind
19:41 ladies but here's where there's a
19:45 contradiction as of the last three or
19:49 four days after talking to my friend
19:51 online when I always when I pop into
19:56 these other I don't know what the hell
19:58 you call them other realities these
20:01 other worlds that are very earth-like
20:03 you know I get a sense of everyone
20:09 having figured it out everyone is on the
20:13 same page everyone's cut from the same
20:14 tree and that tree is the beautiful tree
20:16 of life where no leaf speights another
20:20 leaf right no branch speights another
20:23 branch we're all in this together we're
20:26 all in this to win it the tree is trying
20:28 we're trying to make the Tree of Life
20:30 grow all at the same time and grow
20:33 beautifully spread its wings if you will
20:36 right so the immediate notion that
20:41 happens when I go into this euphoric
20:43 world is that there there is no context
20:47 for committing any sin towards another
20:49 person perhaps is because I haven't been
20:52 there long enough because I can only
20:54 stay for a few seconds as I see these
20:56 overlays and just to read ascribe to
20:59 some of this for you
21:02 sometimes this when I'm driving like I
21:04 said and I get this overlay and the cars
21:06 are there and it feels this amazing
21:08 feeling and and it's like I start to
21:11 kind of see the other reality overlay on
21:13 the one I'm on the the other one that
21:15 was more vivid I was in LA I think I was
21:19 on Fairfax Street or something and I
21:20 came up to this intersection was like it
21:23 was banging into Santa Monica Boulevard
21:24 or something and there was like a like a
21:27 50s diner in front of me like pans or
21:31 whatever and what was over laying on top
21:34 of it was sort of a futuristic
21:36 interpretation of the same thing as if
21:39 which it makes the you know
21:41 architectural sense or civil engineering
21:43 sense because you know if we continue
21:45 growing a population a single story
21:47 building will get replaced by a probably
21:49 a skyscraper or some source and tall
21:51 residential thing but whatever reason it
21:53 didn't and it was like no the population
21:57 stayed relatively similar to what you
21:59 have and take a look at that place and
22:02 it would be this sort of kind of worn in
22:05 patina'd futuristic diner almost look
22:10 like a like a car like a like a train
22:13 car it wasn't but I mean it was just
22:15 very very interesting so to review real
22:19 quick
22:20 Mendel effect is a bunch of us getting
22:24 something different begin the day that I
22:27 heard the Eli Whitney was a white guy I
22:30 made a ton of phone calls every person
22:36 on the phone said well I know he's a
22:37 black guy and so I was like yeah he's
22:42 not anymore
22:43 and people were like what I had you know
22:45 guy he was 70 years old 71 years old
22:47 another guy was 57 years old all family
22:51 friends I called you know they were like
22:53 I don't remember much about about it
22:55 he's black and I'm like yeah for me too
22:57 so for me there's something to Mandela
23:00 that is way bigger than just the lowbrow
23:05 explanation that we're all getting it
23:06 wrong I'm not saying that everyone in
23:09 United States is on the same page but
23:12 pretty it's pretty similar
23:14 to being all in the same page it's a
23:17 huge group of us that have it
23:18 differently there have been movies where
23:24 characters have changed realities right
23:28 somewhere in time with Christopher Reeve
23:30 he fell in love with the woman in a
23:33 painting and he wanted to go back in
23:34 time to to be with her and so he studied
23:40 time-travel and he basically just willed
23:42 it and I remember as a kid thinking
23:45 that's kind of crappy you need a time
23:46 machine you know you need hg wells time
23:49 machine with david warner and knocking
23:51 me down you know going going at it and
23:54 then the more that I experienced this
23:57 sort of observed reality where I'm not
23:59 scared to just accept where I'm seeing
24:02 because it contradicts the paradigms
24:04 that I've been taught that our reality
24:06 [Music]
24:07 it's an interesting thing now I had an
24:11 episode of while back talking about you
24:13 know the secret and the fact that we we
24:17 know that the law of attraction works it
24:19 just does but if it doesn't work for you
24:21 that just means that your faith in your
24:23 what you're attracting is very low at
24:25 that point in your time and your life
24:26 right but that it could be used for
24:29 Battin so imagine being back and this is
24:36 completely fictional but what I'm about
24:38 to say but it will give you an example
24:39 of what simply could be you back in
24:43 Plato's time and all of these you know
24:47 Socrates and all these just you know
24:50 geniuses I'm sure some females in there
24:52 just don't get their names written down
24:53 over the time but let's just say they
24:57 were in an era where they could see the
24:59 difference they could think it and they
25:02 could see it because there's very few
25:04 souls on earth at the time and so you
25:07 don't need to do much interpret you
25:09 could have a party you could have a play
25:12 that gets to a popular room and you
25:14 could have the play you circulate around
25:17 Europe and all the sudden reality
25:20 changes because you literally program
25:24 division into people's minds
25:27 and so when you have Plato talking about
25:30 the time before the moon no maybe they
25:33 romantically thought that bang up you
25:36 know for them it's something completely
25:37 different the eye of God whatever I
25:39 would always imagine the Sun to be eye
25:41 of God but you have the Egyptians who
25:45 are very quarantined in their worlds
25:49 because at the time you know we didn't
25:52 that the idea of mankind distributing
25:55 across the surface of the world is
25:59 something that man had to conceive of
26:01 and we don't think about that anymore
26:03 when you were born in a village and your
26:09 elders threw serendipity figured out
26:12 okay we get our water from over there we
26:15 got our food from over here and this is
26:18 just the way it is there's the Bison
26:20 there there's the boars right there
26:22 there's the vegetables fruits whatever
26:24 and why would you leave you've got
26:25 everything that you need in fact you
26:28 could stray beyond the confines of your
26:32 village and find yourself in a desert
26:34 and then in your primitive mind you're
26:37 facing starvation dehydration and if you
26:41 can escape back to your village you
26:43 bring back a story of like man don't
26:45 ever go outside this village it's just
26:48 hostile we got it we got it going on
26:51 here but the second that someone has
26:53 been sharing out and they find a plush
26:56 new oasis better water supply it's
27:00 easier to get to
27:01 you know berries because this vegetation
27:04 in particular area is much more lush
27:08 then man would start to venture out and
27:11 so the reason I bring that up is that it
27:15 does seem as if the Egyptians themselves
27:18 at some point in really early history
27:22 had figured out how to make a boat and
27:23 make a beautiful boat some of them were
27:27 pretty massive as a matter of fact and
27:29 that allows them to get on the Nile
27:31 because once you stare at the Nile
27:33 and say there's a big monsoon that comes
27:36 by and you know a tree falls into it
27:40 and you see something float on the
27:42 surface and you start putting 1 & 2
27:46 together oh my god we can carve for that
27:48 piece of when we can get inside of it
27:50 you know maybe someone just wrote up a
27:51 log as a joke but they then travel to a
27:55 few miles down the Nile I realized oh my
27:59 gosh we can do this
28:01 you know it seems like we look at the
28:04 Egyptians and their pyramids and their
28:07 temples and their sculptures and all
28:09 that stuff and we don't really think
28:11 about consciously or admit it to each
28:15 other but they lived in a world that
28:17 looked and smelled and tasted completely
28:20 different than our world there's nowhere
28:24 on earth right now
28:25 that's like Egypt besides perhaps Vegas
28:28 you know the the MGM pyramid place right
28:33 but now we have 7.5 billion people we
28:37 now have the Internet
28:38 and if if mass consciousness is how this
28:43 particular instance of this predominant
28:45 reality that we're in is controlled then
28:48 you know I'm not going to get terribly
28:50 under the dark stuff but you know there
28:52 are factions that want us to depopulate
28:55 okay so they want us to depopulate well
29:00 that seems like the overwhelming
29:02 conscious control that we have over
29:05 reality then goes back to perhaps some
29:08 more easily controlled reality now one
29:12 would think that if that was the case
29:13 they want us down to like you know a
29:16 million people because that's quite a
29:18 few people much easier easily controlled
29:24 perhaps they've got some mathematical
29:26 simulation to say okay well we're still
29:28 going to keep all of our control
29:29 apparatus in fact it's going to get even
29:31 better and so of the however many
29:35 million we're allowed to have after
29:36 their little doomsday virus goes around
29:39 they're gonna so imprint on us the
29:42 reality that they want to live in that
29:44 that's all we have maybe they give us
29:47 one and they give themselves another
29:49 another sounds like a little crazy but
29:52 I don't know if you've had this thing
29:55 that I'm talking about and I'm not sure
29:57 what to call it maybe the episode of we
29:58 called that I don't know nothing will
30:01 seem that strange I've talked about this
30:04 several times in the past when talking
30:06 about darker conspiracies it is amazing
30:09 how some people simply can't digest what
30:14 we see and you know it's hard to imagine
30:20 how you can show people you know physics
30:24 the contradicts the imagery that they
30:27 see we've got various politicians that
30:31 have been doing extremely horrible
30:33 things to women and little girls and
30:36 we've got some proof on camera but you
30:39 show it to some people and they're just
30:41 again there Westworld hosts I don't
30:44 doesn't look like anything to me they
30:45 just can't see it but imagine that
30:49 you're in a reality where your your
30:53 brain actually sees more of what could
30:57 be because anything can be their brains
31:01 are less developed or their spirit is
31:04 less developed or their because they've
31:06 been toxified their soul attachment to
31:08 their body is to heat in less
31:10 information and so they can't see it and
31:17 they live in a completely different
31:18 reality any of you have ever seen Pink
31:22 Floyd the wall there's a great animation
31:26 there's so many great animations in that
31:28 in that movie it is just a work of art
31:30 that is hardly celebrated it is like the
31:34 Rock and Roll Fantasia
31:36 but there's a scene where there is a
31:41 it's a it's a man's but let's just put
31:46 that way who is the face of a judge in
31:52 England where they wear the fake hair
31:54 and he's walking backwards but that's
31:56 the way he walks forward let's just say
32:00 his chin is made of a different part of
32:02 the body
32:03 and he is being real cranky and yelling
32:06 and he's sort of being the the the
32:08 teacher but the lead singer of the band
32:13 had as a kid and some people might see
32:20 President United States as that guy and
32:22 their reality they really see it just
32:25 super super evil way beyond what some of
32:28 us see in the complete opposite realm
32:30 and again there's this unifying factor
32:34 between people who seem for mostly
32:38 positive and some people who see them as
32:40 purely negative and I'm not trying to
32:43 make this a political conversation at
32:44 all but I'm trying to give you an
32:45 example of someone we all know that I
32:48 can talk about and we know that there's
32:51 a polarity there you know but the people
32:53 that see him overwhelmingly positive are
32:57 the folks that have a lot more
33:00 experience in life in terms of fighting
33:04 to build something positive in this
33:08 world the more experience you have with
33:09 business the more experience you have
33:11 with people and managing people and
33:13 bringing things together and managing
33:15 finances for a group not just for your
33:17 selfish self right they see him and they
33:20 understand him better for the actors and
33:23 celebrities that have had every line
33:25 written for them and perhaps because
33:27 their face is a particular way and
33:28 they're definitely talented actors their
33:31 sense of reality is completely skewed
33:33 they have lived and built a persona
33:36 meaning they're fake character based on
33:39 literally fake fictional characters that
33:41 have been created for them you know it's
33:45 one thing to be say Mick Jagger and he
33:50 obviously has a persona onstage he does
33:51 not walk around the streets dancing like
33:53 a chicken it's another thing to be a
33:55 Robert De Niro where people know him for
33:58 someone that is probably completely and
34:00 utterly different than every single
34:01 fiber of his body and if you know one
34:05 actor plays two or three different roles
34:08 whether they're they know that within a
34:11 year they could be Tom Cruise in
34:16 Top Gun or it could be Tom Cruise and
34:20 like edge of tomorrow where he played a
34:23 sort of a meet journalist
34:25 at the very beginning you know what I'm
34:28 finding with this situation where I'm
34:31 seeing these kind of echoes of a past or
34:34 it's you know it's funny it's not even a
34:36 sense of the past that's what's weird
34:39 it's as if that world is going right now
34:42 and I'm just not in some worlds I find
34:46 myself just as just as I am today
34:50 driving a car by myself or something
34:52 going down the highway and it feels like
34:54 whenever I was in that reality this this
34:56 particular event occurred some of the
34:59 realities my instantaneously and with
35:02 others and I'm never by myself in those
35:05 other realities I'm always with other
35:07 folks sometimes I feel like a kid in
35:09 some of the realities and sometimes I
35:12 feel like a young adult and so there's
35:16 this notion okay think about it this way
35:19 or just consider for a second
35:22 abstracting reality way away from all
35:25 these rules that we have what is the
35:27 rule well I mean this is gonna be like a
35:30 question you have no chance of answering
35:32 because I'm going to run off on
35:33 different direction here so I don't mean
35:34 to tease you but we believe in this
35:40 world that we are born that were a baby
35:42 and then we go through various stages as
35:44 we grow up we have dependencies and
35:49 relationships on adults and then we are
35:52 to get on our own then we become the
35:55 adult and then typically someone has a
35:58 dependency on us and then eventually our
36:01 body expires and most people you know
36:06 have a philosophy of going to heaven or
36:08 there's nothing or we don't know we get
36:11 reincarnated or whatever and so we have
36:13 certain paradigms to deal with the end
36:17 but now what if I told you none of
36:20 that's actually real all of that is an
36:23 illusion created by the vessel and the
36:27 particular reality or in a particular
36:30 have you ever considered for a moment
36:32 that you're not going to finish the
36:34 story that you're currently in
36:37 imagine if the this goes sound funny to
36:41 those of you were older but imagine at
36:45 some point and it's not directly related
36:49 to your age but at some point you cross
36:53 all the t's dot all the eyes check all
36:56 the boxes and then you get a
36:59 transformation of reality you get to go
37:02 to one of these realities
37:04 perhaps you go back to the reality that
37:06 you were at that's one of these things
37:08 that maybe you've seen and then at that
37:11 moment of transition you're like oh I
37:14 didn't die I never died as that person I
37:17 was in fact I he could be 23 years old
37:21 he could be 12 you could be 78 and you
37:25 just just walk straight into this other
37:27 reality and the whole time you were
37:30 fearing death perhaps you know friends
37:32 was so fear death but you don't die you
37:36 just go to this other reality and if you
37:40 have had the visions that I've had well
37:43 but really Strange's is that every time
37:45 one of these realities happens and one
37:47 of them is um
37:48 it almost feels like the 70s a little
37:51 bit but it's almost like a sci-fi 70s
37:53 it's really strange not massive
37:56 buildings or anything in fact it's kind
37:57 of a small Hawaiian community or
37:59 whatever when I went to Hawaii boy I was
38:01 going through this heavy just seeing old
38:05 architecture and thought process and
38:08 it's almost as if someone has stolen
38:10 buildings out of these realities and put
38:12 them in this one just to remind us just
38:14 ago there's a really great place that
38:16 you'll go to eventually you've been
38:17 there before but perhaps just buying
38:21 into linear time is the most restricting
38:26 paradigm that we can adapt and maybe
38:29 there's a use use for it you know how
38:32 many times you try to do something and
38:34 there's a bunch of interruptions and
38:36 you're like gosh guys it's needs to be
38:38 quieter I need to get to a nice soothing
38:41 place maybe some people like loud
38:44 I used to write screenplays at a local
38:47 bar I used to drink more often hey I
38:50 just got beer and some dinner I'm gonna
38:52 sit there at my script well I used to
38:54 print my scripts and go through them but
38:58 think about the I was giving an example
39:00 of a paradigm where this could be very
39:07 easily this reality that we're in could
39:10 be very easily enforced now let's go
39:15 back to pre Babylonian time and let's
39:20 just use the probably super-wrong
39:22 history of the world which says around
39:24 5000 ad you are seeing the formation of
39:28 the Babylonians because remember they
39:30 made printed coins with Queen Semiramis
39:33 looks just like the Statue of Liberty
39:34 and 4500 BC so that demands a lot of
39:38 intelligence to get to the point where
39:40 you could Forge that coin and have a
39:42 currency right I mean that's a lot of
39:44 work it's more than just 500 years let's
39:46 just say that 5000 years ago we're just
39:49 a budding species on this planet and you
39:54 don't have bills and you don't have
39:56 taxes all you do is get up and you take
39:59 care of life like Africans do today so I
40:02 got a package from Liechtenstein just
40:04 now Thank You Silvia look it into a
40:07 little later but yeah without bills
40:09 without taxes then you don't have this
40:12 necessarily adaptation to linear time
40:14 like we do today okay get up get up get
40:16 it into work get to work make money make
40:18 money make money and I give it to these
40:19 people who don't have linear time right
40:24 do the ruling class of the world worry
40:27 about letting your time hell no they
40:29 don't work for a living even if you want
40:32 to say that they're controlling the
40:33 world and all this other stuff yeah what
40:35 is that a couple meetings a day or maybe
40:37 here maybe a week what I find
40:40 fascinating is that again all of these
40:43 places that I've seen which here's the
40:47 thing you know when someone can make but
40:50 someone could be cynical and say yeah
40:53 you're inventing the East because of
40:54 some
40:55 I don't know inability to accept reality
40:59 she's creating these alternate realities
41:02 and blah blah blah it's like one i
41:04 wouldn't necessarily have ever believed
41:06 that this could even be possible so
41:09 doesn't make any sense that you sit
41:10 around imagining things that you don't
41:12 think are impossible I don't think are
41:14 possible and so it's it's just one of
41:18 those things where you know you'll dream
41:21 things that are absolutely inventive and
41:25 you'll wake up and you'd be like oh my
41:26 god I dreamed about this you know like
41:27 when I was a little kid I said this
41:29 dream once before but that's playing on
41:32 arcade game it's about 85-86 as a dream
41:36 I played a coin-op game stand-up arcade
41:40 right and my parents walked in and said
41:42 we gotta go we gotta go hurry up and I'm
41:44 playing this game and I'm doing really
41:45 really well
41:45 and so in the dream in the split second
41:48 I said okay let me just save my game and
41:51 I had a ram stick right we just didn't
41:53 exist back in the day and I remember it
41:56 was just sitting on where you really
41:59 hope put your quarters to tell someone
42:00 you're gonna play next I took this thing
42:02 off I put it in the box I hit a button I
42:04 grabbed a card out I took off with my
42:06 parents that's pretty much the end of
42:08 the dream but I remember waking up
42:09 fairly soon after that moment in time in
42:12 the dream and I thought wow yeah why
42:15 can't we store everything on brand cards
42:18 and you know 15 years later that was the
42:24 concept the iPods and these little
42:27 readers first iPods up drives in 2000
42:30 songs but yeah you just buy a four gig
42:34 stick at the grocery store for two bucks
42:36 you know what if a place like Egypt for
42:40 instance ancient Egypt is almost the
42:46 carcass of one of these realities but
42:50 these structures are there to trigger
42:53 our minds and this is why we have such a
42:56 weird feeling some of you may recall
42:58 that there's I forgot what it's called
43:00 but there's a like a disease I think or
43:05 some mental condition where some people
43:07 will look at a
43:08 marble statues like the statue be and
43:11 they have really bizarre feelings and it
43:15 is typically relate as a negative
43:17 feeling but negative could be very
43:21 specific to I no longer feel comfortable
43:23 in this reality because I'm seeing the
43:25 old one and I remember that has happened
43:29 to me I mean when I was younger I no
43:31 longer have this issue but I remember
43:33 being a young kid which again would be
43:36 technically speaking even with the
43:40 relativity approach to it I'm a young
43:44 version of what I am today like whenever
43:47 I transitioned to this particular
43:48 reality sort of an infant I'd no longer
43:52 remember where I was before and I'm
43:54 seeing these echoes and when I would
43:56 look at it definitely like looking at
44:00 Catholic religion stuff like going into
44:02 a church and seeing it there was nothing
44:06 warm fuzzy about looking at you know
44:08 Christ on a cross which is something
44:09 that the Catholic Church does in America
44:11 whereas other denominations just have a
44:14 beam you know that creates the cross but
44:18 some of that old architecture when you
44:21 look in books and stuff and you see
44:23 things just I don't know was almost like
44:27 he had had the shining and it's you know
44:28 you were seeing you like it like when
44:31 you grab they say psychics grab objects
44:33 and they can see you know where the
44:35 objects been who owned it you know
44:38 whatever it was used for but it was it
44:41 was almost like a visual version of that
44:52 so what if the universe is really super
44:56 abstract and it is I'll give you another
45:01 example that we run into all the time
45:03 and we've heard this story under times
45:05 if you're over 30 for sure you've heard
45:07 this story how many times have you heard
45:10 people that were in really bad accidents
45:12 and they're in a life-and-death
45:13 situation and the paramedics know to
45:19 keep the patient conscious they start
45:23 talking to them loudly get them to
45:24 answer any questions well what's your
45:26 name mail what are you doing yeah you
45:28 know do you like baseball you know
45:30 whatever you can do to keep them
45:31 conscious you keep them into this
45:33 reality and they don't die but the
45:36 second that the patient loses
45:37 consciousness you lose them how many
45:41 times have we seen old couples they've
45:43 been together for 70 years they're in
45:46 their nineties or even older and when
45:52 one of the spouses passes away the other
45:54 one drifts off one of them has a
45:56 terminal illness and the other one just
45:58 elects to leave but there's the the
46:01 timing is amazing you know you see these
46:03 articles where they'll be in bed holding
46:05 hands and nobody took a poison kid or
46:09 anything like that they just choose to
46:11 go and they have 100% power to let go
46:14 because if you truly find someone that
46:17 you can at least call your soul mate
46:19 those things exists I don't think
46:22 there's if they do exist it's more
46:24 likely that there's multiple people that
46:27 qualify in your life
46:28 to be that special to you because of the
46:31 connection that you have and again to
46:34 say you have your soul mate at 15 is
46:36 different than 25 35 45 55 because as
46:40 you go up every decade what you desire
46:42 from this planet
46:43 especially from another human being
46:44 changes drastically and unless your
46:47 partner grows up exactly with you and
46:50 desires the same things that you want
46:52 you typically grow apart to a degree and
46:55 then there's a bunch of management of
46:56 the relationship as things have been
46:58 flow so never lose faith and finding
47:02 someone super special but
47:05 if you do find someone that you can last
47:07 just the 70 years with I think if both
47:10 of you hit near a hundred and you get
47:12 married at 15 you could be together 80
47:14 years it's just wild right but when they
47:17 leave your soul is attached to theirs
47:20 because of what the Hindu is talking
47:22 about or you make love you exchange a
47:25 part of your soul with the other person
47:27 well let's just say they were able to
47:28 stay active for however long they will
47:30 stay active decades and decades and
47:32 decades and when that soul goes it's a
47:34 siphon on your soul and you just both
47:36 take off I think the reason why this
47:39 fascinates me and one of the reasons why
47:42 I love bringing this to you is that we
47:47 know that there's nothing to fear but
47:48 fear itself which is a statement that
47:52 has so many meanings at so many
47:55 different contexts in so many different
47:57 contexts I should say that we know that
48:01 we shouldn't be living at any point in
48:03 time in fear no matter what let's just
48:09 say like I've been watching videos
48:10 there's a new series on YouTube I don't
48:13 know if it's new who the hell knows I
48:14 forgot to look at the month dates on it
48:16 but they're still making new episodes
48:18 where this guy is going around he he
48:20 spent some time in prison big black guy
48:23 super sweet dude but he's going around
48:26 and he's trying to get kids he's doing
48:28 basically the scared-straight before you
48:31 ever get into prison before you ever
48:32 glorify a life that would put you in
48:35 prison by interviewing ex inmates to say
48:38 tell us your stories tell us the stuff
48:41 you can't unsee the things that changed
48:44 you in some cases some people go with no
48:47 discipline and they end up coming I go
48:48 man I learned a lot about myself one guy
48:50 said you know I had no personal hygiene
48:51 until I went to prison but that's pretty
48:54 rare but if you committed a crime and
48:58 you do go to jail that's that's your
49:00 penalty it's just not being in society
49:02 not getting any more good food and but
49:05 it's not like you can't have some sort
49:07 of happiness in there like we get a
49:08 little crazy of like we've created hell
49:11 on earth in some of these prisons where
49:13 it's like you're gonna go in and gain
49:15 more time you're gonna get beat up
49:16 you're gonna get
49:17 prosecuted way beyond your crime some
49:20 people maybe deserve that kind of stuff
49:23 like an Epstein but some people have
49:26 just got hooked on drugs and they go in
49:29 and then all sudden their whole life's
49:30 upside down they get murdered in prison
49:32 which is not proportionate punishment to
49:35 their crime so fear is everywhere fear
49:39 is on top of fear on top of fear
49:41 but in this reality I'm telling you it
49:43 all washes away seriously it's like when
49:46 your car's been splattered by mud and
49:48 you're able to get to a water supply
49:50 before it dries and it's this amazing
49:53 moment you just write a hose down your
49:54 hood and it all just falls off on your
49:57 driveway and you push it off your
49:58 driveway into the drain everything's
50:00 clean again it was just that easy it it
50:04 always baffles me
50:06 to think for a split second baffles
50:09 probably the wrong word but it's
50:10 fascinating it's interesting to to think
50:15 about sort of what we're not allowed to
50:18 think about in modern reality which is
50:21 to live forever we don't really have a
50:25 plan to live forever do we you know and
50:28 the nice thing is is that as we renew
50:30 it's almost like Doctor Who
50:33 there's brand-new objectives brand-new
50:35 things to do in his particular case he's
50:38 always mitigating threats and mitigating
50:41 evil but maybe in the rest of the
50:44 universe it's just totally chill and
50:47 relaxed and maybe you know when I heard
50:51 Shirley MacLaine coming up with her New
50:53 Age religion in late 80s which she had
50:55 actually gotten off some other guy I
50:56 can't remember what guru or whatever she
50:58 followed her belief system was that we
51:03 definitely live a linear
51:06 compartmentalize life there is no
51:07 reality but the one that we're in for
51:09 the time being but when you die you
51:12 choose exactly what family you're gonna
51:14 go into what time table you're gonna go
51:16 to what difficulty you're on and so just
51:19 accept anything in your life because you
51:21 chose it initially when you think about
51:24 that from the perspective of being a
51:26 straight-up linear human that possibly
51:28 just probably rubs you wrong really
51:31 come on you know I got friends of mine
51:33 that we had parents that beat them up
51:36 and step foster parents that raped them
51:38 and stuff how on earth could that ever
51:40 be something anyone would want to pick
51:44 for themselves and lately I've had a
51:47 couple couple takes on that that may
51:51 change the way that even I view that
51:53 situation which is one imagine imagine
51:58 playing a video game for those of you
52:00 who've played any video game in your
52:01 life you could play certain video games
52:06 and there's there's a game setting for
52:08 the difficulty of the game and what I'm
52:10 super easy when I was like you know
52:12 somebody's some of the top game
52:15 difficulties have been named by their
52:17 creators as impossible you know like
52:19 this is so difficult no help no ammo
52:23 you're gonna it's like rust you know
52:24 it's just like you start off in this
52:25 real basic world but sometimes we select
52:30 a harder level and then the name of the
52:33 game is you don't know what's going to
52:37 take place you have an idea of generally
52:40 what could take place like the
52:41 possibilities the spectrums but let's
52:44 just say you were human yo the other
52:46 side you're sitting in the green room
52:48 chillin with God doing whatever you want
52:49 to do and you go okay well I know you
52:54 see my whole life I mean I see the last
52:56 several thousand lifes I've lived so not
52:58 even care about the ones before that cuz
52:59 it's not important to remember what you
53:02 were before it's not important you live
53:04 forever what does it matter it's all
53:06 about the now so you set the bar a
53:10 little hotter but that doesn't mean you
53:13 know that you're gonna be born into a
53:14 cancerous body you're gonna be born but
53:18 don't abuse of family whatever you don't
53:21 know it could be that you live a fairly
53:22 normal life until maybe you're 20 years
53:24 old and then the apocalypse happens you
53:26 know that's your difficult to read and
53:30 so I think that you know the Shirley
53:34 MacLaine thing is potentially a little
53:37 less I should say on points and more
53:42 metaphorical difficulties
53:46 the other thing that I noticed when I
53:48 have these little visions is that it
53:51 feels a bit like that movie was a
53:55 somewhere in time where Christopher
53:58 Reeve was able to meditate and get back
54:00 to this era to meet this girl and then
54:03 the there's something that happens to
54:05 him in the end of the movie which
54:07 unfortunately reminds him of the current
54:10 time frame and he ends up losing access
54:15 to that that's the false ending by the
54:17 way he goes back to modern day time
54:19 which would be the early 80s so take
54:23 that and put it in reverse
54:24 you're now driving down the street and
54:26 you're having this epiphany like I do
54:28 every once a while haven't had it in a
54:29 while
54:30 Orange County there's some highways down
54:32 here that really nail me there was one
54:34 in Ventura and it is the one that really
54:37 triggers me is up there in Ventura
54:40 California there was a highway that we
54:43 always drove on I can't wear wear that
54:44 hell we were going or why would I when I
54:47 worked at gym while racing it was a
54:49 little highway like a two lane one
54:52 direction tooling the other direction
54:53 which for California is tiny and it had
54:56 walls on both sides of the highway which
54:59 is very traditional for California
55:01 cities because it keeps the sound from
55:03 the highway hitting all the homes but
55:04 had vegetation very old vegetation all
55:07 the way down on top of the walls kind of
55:09 growing on the walls the overpasses were
55:11 all grown over with this vegetation very
55:13 beautiful not like again not
55:16 apocalyptically done when I get in that
55:19 sort of environment I have these these
55:22 flashes it's crazy but now what if for
55:25 one particular time it just goes boom
55:27 boom boom in a minute now at face value
55:32 you might think Oh that'd be
55:33 traumatizing you know you'd be like Who
55:35 am I where am i where am I going but
55:37 here's what's weird when that vision
55:39 occurs for an infinitesimal amount of
55:43 time my life in that world comes back to
55:47 me as if this is who I've always been so
55:52 there's no adaptation moment no shock
55:54 and awe to your system you just fall
55:58 into that real
56:00 I'd be interested if any of you've had
56:02 this happen besides my friend online
56:07 because it's uh it's sort of like a time
56:11 bandit door you know you found something
56:14 in the universe that is giving you
56:16 indications that maybe it's not the way
56:18 you think it is and you know it's a you
56:25 know there's one kind of interesting I
56:26 don't want to ruin anything for you but
56:28 I'll double blind this statement there
56:31 is a science fiction story out there
56:35 that one can watch on TV and there were
56:40 a bunch of synthetic robot kind of
56:44 people who actually were able to escape
56:47 in this oasis kind like Mari Artie in
56:51 Star Trek who I don't know if you've
56:53 ever seen the episodes but he became a
56:57 sentient hologram in one episode and
56:59 then four years later they brought him
57:01 back before they ended next generation
57:03 now he goes for years and he was able to
57:09 escape the hologram but what happened
57:13 was they tricked him into being a
57:15 hologram instead of a hologram and ended
57:17 up putting inside this kind of
57:20 holographic memory computer you could
57:21 hold in your hand and inside that little
57:23 holographic chamber with his girlfriend
57:26 was the whole universe a duplicate of it
57:29 like zani whoops
57:31 universe in his office from hey checkers
57:34 guide and it's just interesting that we
57:38 see those metaphors and science fiction
57:40 all the time but what if the storyline
57:43 actually originated from reality
57:47 something that we all like you know
57:49 think about writers they're sitting
57:51 around writing all the time like when
57:52 you write you observe reality in a
57:55 completely different way because when
57:57 someone says something funny if someone
57:59 goes through a tough time in life if
58:02 there's any heroic actions in your life
58:04 that maybe you know the heroic actions
58:07 at like a three but you know that if you
58:09 wrote it into a fictional circum
58:11 it's changed some things you can make it
58:13 an 8 to a 10 and then you've got a movie
58:16 you got some superhero that you can work
58:18 with not necessarily with mutant powers
58:20 but just a really cool Clint Eastwood
58:22 character back in his youth you know
58:25 well I find fascinating discussing it
58:28 with you now
58:29 is that it is visually triggered and it
58:35 could just be a shape like again when I
58:38 was watching Tron the first and this is
58:43 like a SID thing and what's interesting
58:46 is people who followed Syd Mead the
58:49 futurist designer we get together at his
58:54 house and you have these conversations
58:56 and everyone's trying to tell each other
58:58 why his art is so intoxicating like it
59:05 takes over your entire spirit and I
59:10 remember there's some people in his life
59:13 that were more functional in his life
59:15 and I remember sitting down of finally
59:17 being able to put it into words and
59:18 talking about his use of geometry is use
59:23 his use of primitive shapes and using
59:25 them in ways that we simply haven't seen
59:28 them put together as a functional object
59:30 because everything that typically
59:33 designers designed for futuristic movies
59:36 is always based on previous paradigms of
59:39 thinking and what Syd did was somehow in
59:41 his youth he threw it all out the door
59:43 and said maybe I'll use something that
59:45 exists today but I'm going to always try
59:48 to use something that's never existed
59:49 and then maybe the future will emulate
59:52 his projections and boom you get the
59:55 cyber truck from the Elon Musk which was
59:59 a direct copy of his car from Blade
60:01 Runner that Decker drove around the city
60:04 apparently they have that picture of
60:07 that on the wall at his car design
60:11 facilities I met the one of the guys
60:13 that works at for him it's it's funeral
60:17 but anyway I
60:18 I totally brought this up I articulated
60:20 agree but this person is not a designer
60:23 I just saw deer eyes it was like oh I
60:27 don't really understand anything that
60:28 you're saying is sort of what he told me
60:30 and I was like so sad
60:32 you know it's like because some people
60:34 have been with him for a very long time
60:36 and they just never they got him on a
60:39 different level they got a model of well
60:40 that I never got him and they
60:42 appreciated him infinitely for what they
60:44 got out of him but it's always a
60:46 beautiful thing when you can share a
60:48 communion with someone about one of
60:51 these sort of subjects you know you know
60:54 it just has to do with so much paradigm
60:57 enforcement you know this is the way it
61:00 is and you just need to accept it come
61:03 on you know you're you're defying
61:04 progress if you don't endorse the way
61:07 the world is that's a big lie our
61:11 response should be something like you're
61:14 never gonna see your future if you don't
61:16 Doris from my abstract methodology of
61:19 inventing the future meaning we're to go
61:23 in directions we've never gone before
61:24 not to continue just being in the
61:27 village right at banal Jeff brought up
61:29 earlier we are to eventually figure out
61:33 that traveling the surface of the planet
61:34 is something that's allowed if you
61:37 believe in God well then he worked
61:40 really hard like slot II bought Faust
61:42 and he made glass EAA's and cliffs and
61:47 fjords and and we're supposed to see
61:49 them we're supposed to see these places
61:51 we're supposed to see mountains in
61:53 Colorado in America we're supposed to
61:55 see the Mojave Desert the lush forests
62:00 of Washington State the amazingly flat
62:03 wheat Plains and eastern western Kansas
62:05 we're supposed to see these things and
62:08 if we never get enough guts to do
62:11 something different we're never gonna
62:12 encounter these things but let me throw
62:15 at you another reason why perhaps we
62:18 don't live in those other realities at
62:20 this current time what if we've spent
62:24 damn near and eternity in those other
62:26 realms and now we're kind of like well
62:28 we need to we need to venture out if
62:32 this perspective I feel like this is the
62:35 lamebrain fear-mongering
62:37 village that we live in called planet
62:39 Earth in 2020 but those other places
62:42 don't have any of that there's no fear
62:44 at all in those other places in fact
62:46 it's like it's been distilled out of our
62:48 existence and it's all about waking up
62:51 every day in a super positive world
62:54 there's no threat to your existence at
62:57 all there's not threats for meteorites
62:59 is not threats from humans not threats
63:02 for animals and now let's just see what
63:05 you can create what I have found in in
63:09 pop culture in America is very
63:12 interesting and very consistent let's
63:15 take the 80s against the 90s in the 80s
63:19 you had a lot of people that were stuck
63:21 in bad situations and they they they
63:26 express themselves through hip-hop and
63:29 they were like cocaine is destroying my
63:32 neighborhood don't do it being lazy and
63:35 buying it of welfare programs is
63:36 destroying us don't do it pick yourself
63:39 up don't make excuses yes life could be
63:42 hard that's just the way life is on this
63:44 planet pick yourself up pick yourself up
63:46 get better get better when you look at
63:48 the 90s we had followed a lot of advice
63:52 from the Eze had a positive life and
63:55 then what because it was the opposite
63:57 right we were living we started the
63:59 decade out in the opposite room and
64:01 sought the realm of positivity so we
64:04 start out in a lot of negativity those
64:06 those that that talked about this right
64:08 don't look at those hip-hop making out
64:11 of New York especially because that's
64:12 where it really blew up in that time
64:13 frame look at all the positive electric
64:16 boogaloo out of LA positivity posit
64:20 don't gain fight dance it off which for
64:23 people today might sound really fruity
64:25 but it was awesome you look at the 90s
64:30 you have all the kids that had
64:31 everything right parents gave them
64:34 everything what did they do they went
64:37 often wanted to make everything negative
64:40 dressed like hobos let's have every
64:43 single song it's just like you thought a
64:45 country song winded mode about it you
64:48 know the guy losing his truck and his
64:50 beard is what
64:51 ever his wife or whatever the kids of
64:54 the nineties took it all the way down so
64:56 like you know mentally ill people and
64:58 stuff and it was just like kids that
65:01 didn't have any problems in their lives
65:03 just throwing out negativity so where
65:08 would our world be designed the one that
65:11 we're now the one you can hear my voice
65:12 in right now maybe it's when we're in
65:16 those other realms so positivity we have
65:19 the capacity to design something that is
65:21 more challenging which is what we're in
65:24 today you know the old analogy about a
65:27 coin having two sides you know did we
65:32 want to live in a world with no real
65:34 massive choice I think we could take a
65:38 break every once in a while and go into
65:39 a real positive ground but it's almost
65:41 as if things if they don't flip-flop may
65:45 never get the other side of the coin now
65:47 if you're paying attention there is
65:53 seemingly sort of a perpetual negativity
65:56 in the 21st century right as these
65:57 individuals that run the planet really
66:00 want to gain control through repression
66:03 you know through taking away all of our
66:04 money taking aware of our livelihoods
66:07 and that kind of thing so you know just
66:11 be fastening if and people have prayed
66:14 to do this and people are in the
66:16 meditation and more crystal base
66:19 lifestyles you know they've had efforts
66:23 where they try to meditate on the world
66:24 and make it a better place and meditate
66:26 on the world and I actually think if we
66:28 could get a masked majority which is a
66:29 lot of what Stephen Greer's latest movie
66:31 Close Encounters of the fifth kind is
66:33 trying to assert that if we can just
66:36 consciously think this place up be
66:40 fascinating if not only did the world
66:42 get more positive but that one of those
66:43 overlaid places that I've seen just
66:46 flutters into reality you know it's like
66:49 someone cross dissolving two video feeds
66:52 from say this is LA in 1903 was doing
66:58 1850 where it's just all dirt roads
67:01 barely anyone lives here and then we
67:03 overlay 19
67:05 five are in 1835 LA where Hollywood's
67:09 booming and you know everyone's got a
67:13 future the American dreams alive freedom
67:16 is just all around you constantly you
67:19 could be anything you want to be sort of
67:20 in I think one of the silver linings for
67:24 2020 so far this is March 6th is that
67:29 we've sort of disengaged from the
67:33 control media or paying attention to
67:37 each other more we're spending more time
67:39 with each other during this phase and
67:41 this is a good time to kind of bring up
67:43 these subjects because you have some
67:45 peace and quiet in your life you're
67:47 forced to have it you can't go to work a
67:49 lot of people can't go to work it's now
67:52 about to change here the end of this
67:53 week which is great and we're organizing
67:57 our thoughts we're organizing our
67:59 spirits we are becoming more sentient
68:01 and just think about as they turn the
68:04 world back on what if we kept the
68:07 regiments that we learned during this
68:09 cycle we go out and a lot more
68:14 strategically I should say not less but
68:16 more strategically we appreciate a walk
68:20 on the beach unlike before like I've
68:22 always tell you guys when you when you
68:24 live in the Midwest you might think
68:26 about moving to California and then yeah
68:29 I'm just gonna go the beach everyday
68:30 beach beach beach waves they'll start
68:32 surfing better though and then you move
68:33 here and life is very you know hectic at
68:36 times and demanding and you don't
68:39 perceive the beach as what it truly is
68:42 which is this beautiful Oasis you know
68:44 they want to charge you everywhere you
68:46 go like if you want to park on the beach
68:49 let's say you want to go every day
68:51 you're gonna have to set aside I don't
68:55 know 300 bucks to go every day of the
68:58 month because your parking is gonna run
69:00 yeah the metered parking there's Beach
69:03 parking there's structured parking
69:05 unless you live close enough to just get
69:08 on a bike and go down there for free
69:11 which is why those homes costs millions
69:13 and millions of dollars down there so
69:15 you're kind of paying one way or the
69:17 other you can't enjoy the Wonder
69:19 of nature without coughing up some cash
69:23 and I know there's a lot of places where
69:25 that is not the case so trust me I'm
69:27 aware but maybe now it's more like yeah
69:32 freedom is something that really really
69:34 exists
69:35 fear is something that is not naturally
69:38 a part of well-balanced Society and so
69:43 we just wholly reject anything that goes
69:45 against those peaceful mechanisms and of
69:49 course if you have another area of the
69:51 world that is in tyrannical situation
69:53 and they're trying to take over the
69:55 world which is pretty much China at this
69:57 point and we're gonna have to like make
69:59 provisions to say okay well we're going
70:01 to control those you know the Communists
70:03 over there from doing a bunch of
70:05 nefarious stuff you know reading our
70:08 computers and really trying to buy up
70:10 all of our land and erase our way of
70:13 life so we have to keep our keep on our
70:18 toes is it would be we don't want to let
70:21 it get to a point where we're in out war
70:22 so we want to engage in things that are
70:24 so enforced through design that you
70:30 can't get there and they can't get there
70:32 and we don't have to go there that sort
70:34 of thing anyway let me know what you
70:38 think about all this it's I apologize
70:41 for struggling to explain some of this
70:44 stuff hopefully and giving you enough
70:48 that you can kind of see what's going on
70:50 and I have to say I'm utterly fascinated
70:53 if any of you have experienced this
70:55 finding another soul in the world that
70:57 told me she was experiencing this and I
71:00 don't think she's seen all the episodes
71:01 I don't know was very powerful for me it
71:05 was like oh my god really you see that -
71:07 and again her experience is most likely
71:10 different than mine completely but it's
71:13 still the same concept same open
71:17 paradigm was of reality being more
71:19 abstract and nebulous and the other
71:24 thing too would be there are various
71:27 factions out there that lean on Malchus
71:31 a Scientology
71:33 heavily on reincarnation in a previous
71:37 life and so you know I don't know if
71:41 this was LR and Hubbard's initial
71:44 assertion I think it was but this
71:47 original sin that keeps all of the
71:49 Christians to check believing that
71:51 you're always in error and you have to
71:53 constantly worship going through man
71:54 thus being controlled the Scientology
71:58 folks do it a different way they say
71:59 that you know anything that's bad in
72:02 this world is an echo from the previous
72:04 bad thing you did in a previous world
72:05 the previous life excuse me and so
72:08 they've created a rigid I'll send in a
72:09 different way such you have to
72:11 constantly go and get those sessions you
72:13 know until you're broke and so I
72:17 disagree with that completely because I
72:20 don't think a man should be ever told
72:23 I mean imagine you didn't believe that
72:24 before and then someone tells you that
72:26 you believe it you wanted Christianity
72:27 before but someone tells you by the way
72:29 do you know about original sin oh the
72:31 hell is that well you're a sinner
72:33 because even Adam and Don it sits on
72:36 your back and you know you're not
72:37 perfect and and so is it moments always
72:40 say that well you know you're not
72:41 perfect so you need us it's like maybe I
72:46 need you as an individual because you've
72:48 got a solution to a problem I've got but
72:50 needing your whole paradigm and your
72:52 your prison planet thing anyone who's
72:55 selling you an original sin thing where
72:58 they have the solution and you don't
72:59 it's selling you a prison paradigm
73:02 there's no other way you can look at it
73:04 in my opinion so imagine that what I'm
73:09 saying is true
73:09 and let's say some brilliant people
73:12 figured it out
73:13 they're like oh oh and there's there's
73:16 four or five guys at a table you know
73:18 he's Jekyll Island kind of meetings and
73:19 they're like well what's the deal you
73:21 know there's that you know the reality
73:23 is very abstract we've talked about this
73:24 we all agree yeah yeah okay well if they
73:28 ever find out that they have the option
73:31 of just choosing to walk away from this
73:34 and they know that there's other
73:36 realities and they don't fear death
73:38 anymore because they understand that
73:41 there's just an infinite amount of
73:43 realities out there well maybe they
73:46 won't be so sick
73:47 to cut our heads off yeah those of us to
73:49 control the world make it a bad place
73:51 and so they take which you figure out
73:55 about the world they always cast it in a
73:57 way that is back to their control like
73:59 rats
74:00 oh yeah you figure that but you know
74:02 it's not bad it's this it's original sin
74:04 you know something ridiculous so this is
74:08 where we get into that policing your own
74:10 paradigm make your own decisions observe
74:12 the universe acknowledge what you see
74:14 don't worry about everyone else's
74:16 opinion including mine so let me know
74:18 what you think in the comments if you
74:21 haven't been to d-class radio comm it's
74:23 all spruced up so we have all the videos
74:26 up there I think they're all categorized
74:27 properly now we have two video two audio
74:33 for social media couple ways to donate
74:36 we had a donation through PayPal today
74:38 which I'll throw out a shout out the
74:39 credits in this one I think it the
74:41 person's handle which is cool but in the
74:44 previous ones I was just kidding the
74:45 fact I was getting donated to and I I
74:47 didn't see any name but again times your
74:51 times are rough so I understand if
74:53 anyone needs to suspend their their
74:55 financial support but I for all those
74:57 who sacrifice a buck or two thank you so
74:59 much or even more we have an all-new
75:02 remastered season one there's a store I
75:05 just want to get some chat skis for
75:06 season five this will be done probably
75:08 by at least the end of the month when
75:10 this season is over and will dream up
75:12 some new ideas but anyway take care of
