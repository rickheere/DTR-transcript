00:34 hmm welcome back ladies gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts this is gonna be probably
00:40 the only third season night episode my
00:44 buddy Dave
00:45 gave me this beautiful Monte Cristo
00:47 Cuban for my birthday
00:49 so I thought I'd slide it up it's been
00:52 extremely balmy and warm in Southern
00:56 California due to our little tropical
00:57 storm down by nichole so I thought we'd
01:02 do an episode on the afterlife and the
01:07 main reason is that we've had a
01:09 consistent stream of questions about
01:12 sort of my impressions of this and
01:16 someone recently posted a article on the
01:18 site on the Facebook group page that
01:23 scientists have concluded that the
01:25 afterlife can't exist and what blows me
01:29 away about that is just that anyone
01:31 would ever in their right mind with a
01:34 straight face post such an assertion
01:37 from their completely biased pop science
01:42 view of things right but let's go to the
01:47 root of of the assertion to begin with
01:53 because you might say to yourself well
01:58 none of us have really been there except
02:00 for those people who have passed away
02:02 and saw something on the other side and
02:06 I've I've definitely talked about a lot
02:08 of these experiences recently will
02:10 briefly touch them in this
02:13 but the focus of this is to just kind of
02:17 separate our reality from that reality
02:20 and then take a look at how people are
02:23 there believe in it or poopoo it right
02:27 but the big question is where did this
02:32 belief come from you ever wonder about
02:35 that now since we don't really know
02:39 because we weren't back in the time of
02:42 man not having written language most
02:46 likely having very little form of
02:48 society probably just really sort of a
02:50 pack animal sort of thing and then and
02:52 again I understand that well it's just
02:56 represent both sides of the fence that
02:58 would be more of a evolutionary
03:03 assertion and I don't mean that we came
03:05 from some other animal right all my
03:10 research indicates that there was a
03:12 divine moment of intervention and not
03:15 divine in the way that there is a God
03:17 who is creating us completely from
03:20 scratch
03:21 I don't personally have any evidence to
03:23 that assertion but what I do have is
03:27 plenty of evidence in the in the missing
03:30 link science of man which I've talked
03:32 about several times on the show that we
03:35 appear to be genetically hobbled and you
03:38 know things like our visual cortex being
03:40 limited to 10% of our visual cortex
03:44 tissue in the back of our brain there's
03:46 a genetic blocker that that prevents us
03:48 from using at all but there is a
03:51 consistent amount of Bones that our
03:53 hominid ape-like monkey like and then
03:57 there's this missing link and and all of
03:59 a sudden it would appear that even with
04:02 official science there's the Homo
04:05 sapiens sapiens standing right next to a
04:07 Yeti marry a hominid so whenever we
04:13 started however we started there was
04:15 most likely a moment that we see in
04:17 monkeys even today or one of us died and
04:23 regardless if they were young or old
04:25 obviously it becomes much more
04:26 more profound when they're young and I
04:29 would say you know I'm not trying to
04:33 split errors here but I think that the
04:35 more that someone exists on this planet
04:38 and then disappears it becomes more and
04:41 more painful now when you get into your
04:44 declining years let's just say where
04:46 you're fighting the decay of your body
04:48 sort of thing just because hey it
04:50 happens it starts to you at least exude
04:55 some sort of indicator that it is close
04:58 to your time and every year that goes by
05:00 after one feels this way it's it's a
05:04 bonus all right so say you have
05:07 troubling health at a particular age and
05:10 you live ten more years well that's
05:13 awesome and you got ten more years out
05:15 of the game but having a teenager pass
05:19 away you know a child that is at least
05:22 gotten to a point where they speak it
05:25 has to be more painful than someone
05:28 we've never spoken to because perhaps
05:30 they're just a baby
05:31 all of it's massively painful and it's
05:36 that pain that some might think causes
05:41 the need to create a fiction that would
05:45 be an afterlife so if you're a scientist
05:48 saying it's impossible well I think
05:52 there's a lot of things to answer for
05:53 quite frankly if you want to come up
05:55 with that assertion I'm sure Isis on
05:56 fringe group that goes deep into that
06:01 conclusion but I don't think that the
06:04 afterlife always has to ascend out of
06:08 sort of fear defense mechanism in my own
06:14 journey
06:15 I haven't had well let's put it this way
06:17 my only real conversation and which is
06:21 sort of a air quotes term about the
06:28 belief in the afterlife was probably out
06:30 of Hollywood and television ghost
06:35 stories when you're a kid
06:37 sort of insinuate and after life you
06:39 know the old story about the the trucker
06:42 that picks up a hitchhiker and delivers
06:44 them to a truck stop and later he finds
06:46 out that the person identified
06:48 themselves has actually passed away and
06:50 maybe got hit by a truck some irony
06:52 there or something right and that's an
06:55 interesting way to get the algorithm
06:57 inside you without a fear pushing it in
07:00 you now when someone passes away there
07:05 is and especially like when I was in
07:07 high school let me just share this with
07:08 you I had quite a few people probably
07:12 half a dozen people that I knew really
07:14 well died car accidents motorcycle
07:18 accidents ice accidents just mishaps
07:22 right and when they pass away if you
07:26 have any sense of you know free will and
07:31 and sort of this that the whole
07:33 sovereign thing if they had the right to
07:35 live sort of thing you want to undo time
07:41 you want to bring them back give them a
07:43 second chance but they're gone and you
07:48 can't affect anything and so the next
07:52 best thing in some cases might be
07:54 inventing a fiction where you make it
07:57 okay in your mind your brain is having a
08:00 tremendous difficulty dealing with it
08:03 now I know that I would say personally I
08:10 probably am guilty of leaning on that
08:13 paradigm in the midst of the pain about
08:15 losing someone right there was a distant
08:20 cousin of mine who died in a really
08:25 stupid accident in my hometown and her
08:30 name was Maria and for whatever reason I
08:35 never met Maria never met her in my life
08:37 I think she was one year either ahead of
08:41 me being able to ever be in the same
08:43 school with her besides perhaps a grade
08:45 school you know you have in my my years
08:48 it was six school sixth grades
08:50 Skinnygirl makes the no.1 school but you
08:53 know junior in high school for me was
08:55 three years a pop right so seven eight
08:58 nine ten eleven twelve alright but I got
09:02 to French class one day I was checking
09:05 into French crafts there was the
09:07 beginning of school year at which I
09:08 think it's I think it was the beginning
09:09 of the school year because it was still
09:10 summertime so go to French class and I
09:13 don't know if you guys remember but when
09:15 you had the books that were assigned to
09:17 you in class you know the books that are
09:19 whatever five ten years old you had to
09:22 write your name in the front of the book
09:23 in this little ledger you were the next
09:26 student to own that book and then sort
09:28 of let people return it to you if they
09:29 if you lost it and I opened this up and
09:34 the last person to have my book was
09:36 Maria and she had just passed and for
09:40 whatever reason and I mean I had I had
09:45 been exposed to loss before and I didn't
09:49 know her I didn't have any connection
09:51 with her other than I know that I'm
09:53 related to her through some some kind of
09:56 cousins relationships and that kind of
09:58 stuff and at least I think I am but her
10:03 name isn't staring right back at me so
10:05 it's fresh and obviously you could just
10:09 say hey man just a coincidence right but
10:12 there was something very sort of warming
10:16 about having her be with me in this
10:20 really weird situation it was really
10:23 strange everyone else who passed away
10:25 they just passed away I didn't have any
10:28 connection with them whatsoever so let's
10:30 just chalk that one up to coincidence
10:32 you know we see our loved ones suffer
10:35 through sicknesses and they eventually
10:36 pass there's a point where we simply say
10:39 well at least the sufferings done you
10:41 know and we want to think that they're
10:43 in a better place and so there's that
10:45 arc of the equation now I've done an
10:49 episode on reincarnation which really
10:51 calls out the the sort of need to have
10:58 an ecosystem to the energy that is us
11:00 because energy in any form
11:03 cannot simply disappear at most it could
11:07 diffuse into a more generic form and
11:10 then reform of something else right
11:13 what's really interesting about the
11:15 equation is think about how SETI works
11:19 the search for extraterrestrial
11:21 intelligence
11:23 it's a program up in the Bay Area it's
11:26 not sort of technically around the world
11:28 because everyone's using their computers
11:29 to crunch packets looking for this data
11:33 but the whole theory is that radio
11:36 transmissions could be coming in from
11:38 space and we will decipher some sort of
11:41 intelligent prime number pattern out of
11:44 them or what have you and we'll start to
11:46 be able to translate what they're saying
11:47 let me find out that we're not alone
11:50 movie contact was all about that right
11:52 based on Carl Sagan's book we also know
11:57 that all the broadcasts that we're
11:58 making into space are often sold inside
12:01 safe science fiction films which are
12:04 trying to be serious about science as
12:07 the mechanism by which aliens would
12:10 learn our language and find us and so
12:13 right there in front of your face
12:15 scientists are telling you that unless
12:17 something acts on the energy and
12:21 diffuses it it's going to be out there
12:24 traveling the Stars you know forever
12:27 never never and someone who someone
12:31 might be doing setting on the other side
12:33 of our galaxy and deciphering us right
12:35 now deciphering deep thoughts so what I
12:40 think is interesting is is that we
12:41 subscribe to that methodology of science
12:44 which we can prove on a piece of paper
12:47 but somehow the frequency that is the
12:49 radio station that is your soul
12:52 immediately vanishes doesn't exist right
12:55 we're simply the radio there's no
12:57 program coming out of us right as I get
13:01 older I am more and more and more
13:04 convinced that just the concept of being
13:10 stuck in a body is
13:15 sort of laughable that this is what we
13:18 think we are in entirety it is an
13:22 amazing invention all right whoever
13:25 designed in this place and I believe as
13:27 I've said several times on many shows
13:28 that everything that lives is beautiful
13:32 plants are beautiful fish are beautiful
13:34 insects humans everything right in terms
13:38 of how the ecosystem works that you can
13:41 survive off of water for a really long
13:43 time you can eat very little food and
13:45 you survive I mean it's amazing how
13:46 resilient our bodies are especially if
13:49 we don't toxify them rain but we're so I
13:55 think undereducated about what we are as
13:59 a human being that our brains can't get
14:04 to an existential thought process of
14:06 what our souls could possibly be right
14:09 how many of you know the entire purpose
14:13 of your digestive system what the
14:17 pancreas does what the spleen does with
14:19 the liver does upper intestine lower
14:21 intestine gall bladder kidneys how many
14:25 of you know all that stuff how your
14:27 stomach functions a lot of us have the
14:30 basics but most of us don't know
14:32 everything we probably took class that's
14:33 right standard biology in high school
14:35 and they teach you all these different
14:37 things about what things do but you
14:39 forget because why would you need to
14:40 know it all works in the autonomic
14:43 system so we have this kind of deep
14:47 mystery with within the vessel that we
14:50 are today and I think that if you were
14:55 to somehow try to gain an understanding
14:59 of how you might be a symbiotic creature
15:01 between your soul and your body
15:03 functioning together an intelligent
15:06 energy that is untrackable with any of
15:08 the instruments that we have because
15:10 perhaps it again doesn't affect ether
15:13 winds and so you don't have any
15:15 disturbance of gravity you don't have
15:17 any disturbance of electricity in your
15:18 body perhaps then we don't have a
15:23 vocabulary to really engage what the
15:27 soul is it goes
15:28 into Street metaphysics so where would a
15:32 scientists gain certainty in that realm
15:37 as ludicrous as it sounds they do it all
15:40 the time because you know I think it's
15:45 not a mystery that scientists are
15:48 obviously the sort of offspring of the
15:55 need to be intelligent if whatever
15:59 you're socially awkward or would have
16:01 you and you are trying to establish
16:03 yourself in society you have a few means
16:09 to do it if you're socially awkward then
16:11 you have to become useful learn how to
16:14 build things they're not a program
16:16 things set up things be useful and so
16:21 once a person engages themselves and
16:26 figures out a formula they have a love
16:29 which might be computers you have a fear
16:31 of computers if they come in and solve
16:33 things they're your Geek Squad well you
16:36 are very happy they're there you're very
16:39 happy that they're willing to deal with
16:40 the thing that you don't have any time
16:42 to deal with and so you keep you throw
16:44 money at them and you live you get to
16:47 use your computer after it's all over
16:48 and you're really happy if they're good
16:50 they make it easy well what's
16:52 interesting about my average fellow
16:55 nerds that I've worked with in my
16:57 lifetime is that they're typically
16:59 jack-of-all-trades master of some and
17:04 because they're self educated when you
17:07 learn that you can teach yourself
17:09 something then you fear nothing because
17:13 you think I'll just watch a youtube
17:15 video read a book talk to somebody I'll
17:17 figure it out if I want to know this
17:19 information I will figure out a way to
17:20 get it inside me but usually the problem
17:26 with that faction is that it doesn't
17:31 typically always come with the right
17:34 brain it's usually only a mechanism of
17:36 the left brain the pragmatic side
17:40 everything's a list of steps well where
17:44 do you start if you want to start having
17:45 the remote the most remote thought about
17:49 a soul where do you start because you
17:53 could walk into a church today and ask
17:55 people if you have souls and they'll say
17:56 yes and then you say well what is it I
17:58 don't know
17:59 God works in mysterious ways and so
18:02 you're back down at the beginning
18:04 nothing
18:06 told something exists with no real
18:08 functional paradigm of how it exists and
18:12 you know on one level that doesn't
18:15 necessarily commit you know constitute a
18:18 crime or anything but there's one thing
18:21 I want to put out there really early in
18:23 the episode and that's the following
18:26 please don't allow people to control
18:30 your opinion of your soul the afterlife
18:33 and all that kind of stuff make up your
18:37 own mind and don't worry about what
18:39 other people think the truth of matter
18:42 is is that other people aren't really as
18:46 smart as you think they are and it's
18:50 because most people focus on a
18:52 particular subject and you might find
18:55 the most brilliant
18:57 astrophysicist or whatever almost bring
19:01 a chef but unless they have spent a
19:04 tremendous amount of time thinking about
19:06 what you're thinking about whatever it
19:08 might be
19:10 hmm don't lean on them so hard
19:15 imagine you had a group of people that
19:19 are responsible by by way of assignment
19:21 and being tenured professors at major
19:27 instigation alinder job is to write
19:30 papers about things otherwise they
19:33 become obsolete they really haven't
19:35 earned their check let's just put that
19:37 way and so sort of like me making these
19:40 shows I've committed to making a hundred
19:44 shows in one year and that's a season
19:47 well I do my damnedest to try and make
19:50 them interesting but I know I have some
19:52 out there that kind of
19:54 right and I shouldn't be viewed as any
19:57 Oracle of knowledge I'm just a doob with
19:58 an opinion that hopefully makes you
20:00 think about your opinion and maybe my
20:03 life journey has a couple cool shots
20:05 keys that you can apply to your life I
20:07 guarantee you if I could listen to you
20:10 the equivalent amount of time I would
20:13 learn a ton from you no matter how
20:15 complex are simple your life is
20:17 something would cross over and I'd say
20:19 oh my god never thought about that right
20:20 now in my life I have I was duped for a
20:27 large portion of my life and was really
20:29 into pop science for probably a good
20:33 thirty five years from birth to 35 right
20:36 and so I became experts at various pop
20:40 science things which may or may not be
20:42 true I now really don't hold them in
20:48 much of value except that when I want to
20:51 come up with well when I've studied
20:53 other people's true science in my
20:56 opinion it was very instrumental in
20:59 understanding what they're asserting by
21:01 knowing what I've been told because
21:02 usually the lesson our Eric Dollard use
21:06 of standard science to teach you the new
21:08 way the new thinking which is the whole
21:11 thinking from the 1800s right there's a
21:15 lot of that that has value but since 35
21:19 and especially since the show started
21:20 and just diving deeper into my own brain
21:23 to pause AAPIs ODEs and really taking
21:28 that that the new exercise and saying
21:30 let's just take things at face value
21:32 sometimes and see what that means to us
21:36 you know be like looking at the
21:38 hieroglyphs of Egypt or you have you
21:41 know horses actually a man with a hawk
21:44 head you know it always bothered me that
21:47 that they came up with those theories
21:49 because there was something and even as
21:50 a kid I thought there's no way these
21:52 people really existed like that you know
21:54 I think when I was a kid I looked at
21:57 that stuff and I sort of had this
21:58 internal feeling of disinformation why
22:03 did they go to some weird allegorical
22:04 thing no quite frankly me
22:07 these aliens that participated in our
22:10 creation or whatever maybe they are
22:14 Anubis and and all these other animals
22:17 right but when it comes to the soul it's
22:21 a very interesting conversation because
22:23 you don't get to have it that often with
22:25 other people because the end of they
22:27 believe in it they haven't taken their
22:29 conversation very far in their own minds
22:31 and you can't blame them because hey
22:34 this is a very esoteric thing to talk
22:36 about we don't have a laboratory with
22:40 magnets and you know metal shavings and
22:44 wire and paper to conduct experiments to
22:47 discover electricity or electromagnetism
22:50 wherever you are is the laboratory to
22:55 study the soul and to contemplate its
22:59 ecosystem in a realm that is not like
23:02 this one literally speaking flesh and
23:06 blood so where do we start the
23:10 scientists of the world want us to think
23:12 about our brains as this sort of tubular
23:16 mesh with a bunch of chemicals inside of
23:18 it and believe me they've done amazing
23:21 experiments to control your body by
23:26 messing with your brain right we did the
23:29 frogs but electricity on their legs and
23:32 the leg jumps and so there's this
23:35 knee-jerk reaction to say there we've
23:38 got it all figured out you probably seen
23:41 those videos if you've combed the
23:44 internet for a while or watched some
23:45 stuff on television where people getting
23:47 brain surgery and they're tapping on the
23:48 brain
23:49 people will start speaking in accents
23:53 from remembering things there's a
23:56 relationship the brain is obviously a
23:58 very important organ right I want you to
24:02 think about the fact that there are many
24:04 people who have been utterly injured and
24:06 their brains have been removed and yet
24:09 they're able to relearn as if there's
24:11 some redundancy program between left and
24:13 right
24:15 psychologists the psychiatrist's have
24:17 come in and studied the loss of right
24:20 brain left
24:20 bring personalities when that occurs let
24:25 me ask you guys this question for any of
24:27 you who have known a what you would call
24:31 a wise old man a wise old woman
24:35 in my experience the more
24:40 three-dimensional their experiences in
24:42 the world have been which is kind of
24:44 what I define as wise now why the reason
24:47 why I make that distinction is you might
24:49 find a person who's old who has a
24:52 tremendous amount of information about a
24:54 particular subject and the more you talk
24:56 to them boy you just become an
24:58 apprentice that's that's really not what
25:02 I'm talking about I'm sort of talking
25:04 about those people that you meet that
25:06 are like the Oracle in the movie matrix
25:08 they sort of have if not completely have
25:12 the most complete vision of humanity
25:17 than anyone else you've ever met because
25:20 perhaps they raised a bunch of kids at
25:22 their own they raised their their kids
25:24 their grandkids they've existed in
25:27 society during depressions and you know
25:31 the golden era of America the demise of
25:33 America so they've got potentially by
25:37 the time you meet them they're in their
25:39 80s they've had 80 years plus to see how
25:43 it all works and for whatever reason
25:45 they were a little more awake as a kid
25:46 and everyone else and they're wise and
25:49 they're intelligent they have
25:50 intelligence and knowledge but they have
25:53 it experienced which is wisdom right
25:58 I've been blessed to meet some of these
26:00 people and what's interesting about them
26:04 is that they are seldom religious in any
26:07 way that we would define as traditional
26:10 religion it's not that they take the
26:14 crucifixes off the wall or what have you
26:16 it's not that they wouldn't visit a
26:18 church but there's a deeper level to
26:22 their entire being it's almost as if
26:25 they are at a different elevation from
26:29 normal humanity because they're wise
26:31 right
26:33 and when that occurs you have something
26:35 beautiful happen because they will look
26:39 at you and I've had one gentleman tell
26:41 me he was in his early 60s and he had
26:47 had an incredible life an absolutely
26:50 incredible life and there was a time
26:53 when he was stuck on a boat in the
26:55 middle of the ocean and he was lost just
26:58 like some crazy story you might hear
27:01 where someone's on a raft and on nowhere
27:03 he had a little over a day in this
27:08 experience and he's also a guy that has
27:11 been more lucid than most people that
27:13 I've ever met from a very young age
27:14 super accomplished guy and he had seen
27:20 some things when he was out there and he
27:23 goes look I wasn't necessarily
27:26 dehydrated I had water I had food my
27:29 belly wasn't empty so I wasn't going
27:32 through any psychotic spell because I
27:36 was a little afraid that no one would
27:37 find me I thought I might die out there
27:42 but he goes I managed to keep my
27:44 composure and he said that when he sat
27:49 out there the isolation out there away
27:52 from all the frequencies of the
27:54 continent right television stations
27:56 radio stations were severely subdued out
27:59 there in the middle of nowhere this is
28:00 way before cellphones right he went from
28:03 being pretty secular to being very
28:07 spiritual now the cool thing about this
28:09 gentleman is that he's not weak either I
28:12 mean he wouldn't sit there and panic and
28:15 if he were to die he would take it like
28:18 a man that's the kind of dude this - it
28:19 is but he said when he was on his boat
28:25 he just kept loosening his grasp on
28:28 reality and to the point he could see
28:32 Souls is what he said and he said that
28:38 according to him he goes look I got to
28:40 the point where I could see Souls
28:43 everywhere
28:45 and he's a guy who is not religious at
28:48 all in fact he's probably a guy not I
28:52 know him better that without that
28:55 experience he would probably be the most
28:59 clinical atheist you could ever meet
29:00 probably because he never really
29:02 mentioned spirituality to me except
29:05 these this very specific story but what
29:08 do we know about the afterlife really we
29:13 hear that people die and they have
29:15 experiences but then we know we dream as
29:17 well right now I think that
29:21 scientifically we should parse it two
29:23 different ways when it comes to
29:25 potentially a dream mechanism in our
29:28 mind playing with our vision during an
29:31 accident let's just say some
29:34 near-death experience right now some
29:37 people are sick whether it be some
29:40 immediate trauma that happens to them
29:42 and they go to the hospital and they're
29:44 getting worked on and during that visit
29:46 they lose what doctors would say their
29:51 life their EKG goes to zero no brain
29:56 activity and yet they have a complete
29:59 lucid experience floating out of their
30:01 body looking down having this amazing
30:04 euphoric feeling which is probably the
30:06 best thing most people have a fairly
30:08 euphoric feeling in this experience
30:10 which means when we pass away there's a
30:13 little gift from God in there okay you
30:15 don't need to feel any more pain we're
30:16 done with this particular journey so
30:19 feel really good but you might say well
30:23 they premeditated it because they knew
30:27 that they were sick now all the
30:30 instruments in the room indicate that
30:33 they don't have the physical ability to
30:35 dream anymore because they're dead sort
30:39 of your heart beating and dreaming kind
30:42 of go together
30:43 some people have brain activity monitors
30:46 attached to them during their illness
30:48 right yet they come away with stories
30:51 about seeing something on the other side
30:55 but there are some people who died even
30:59 though they come back to life who didn't
31:02 see it coming a car accident with her
31:05 broadsided they had no idea the other
31:07 card existed until they were hit and yes
31:10 the brain has an amazing ability to work
31:12 work very quickly so one could Kontest
31:14 in the impact milliseconds they are
31:19 becoming terrified and aware that they
31:21 have potentially lost their life but I
31:24 think that there's a few cases I have
31:27 seen where people have reported being in
31:29 car accidents and had nothing and had no
31:33 awareness that this was happening and
31:37 they have the most fanciful afterlife
31:39 visions of any of us there's a
31:43 correlation between a scientist feeling
31:45 impotent about the brain and the
31:49 afterlife and just what gives us that
31:52 that little Frankenstein spark of life
31:54 the very beginning they feel impotent
31:58 that they can't answer the question
32:00 what's really going on because if they
32:03 could answer that question they could
32:05 create life themselves and hopefully
32:09 it's still true that they can't but they
32:12 look at the religious people or people
32:14 that believe in an afterlife
32:15 whether it be heaven with clouds pearly
32:20 gates and a big wall around heaven to
32:25 keep the bad guys out they think those
32:29 people are weak too and impotent because
32:32 they can't deal with the fact that it
32:35 doesn't exist they're making it all up
32:37 bright the fact remains that if the soul
32:42 is comprised of something that is not
32:44 trackable by any instrument that man has
32:47 ever invented then we can't say that we
32:54 know either way we definitely don't have
32:57 a no and we know we don't have a yes
33:00 now I had a friend of mine who just
33:02 recently passed away and was revived and
33:06 his big thing was he
33:09 I just went to sleep I didn't have any
33:12 visions of anything and I just walked
33:14 back up his journey was almost
33:18 instantaneous in terms of from the
33:20 moment they didn't have a pulse on him
33:23 due to a heart attack and the
33:26 defibrillator that hit his chest choice
33:29 very little time passed not that the you
33:33 know you need to be gone for a little
33:35 while but it would seem that all the
33:38 stories that I've ever heard about the
33:39 afterlife and people having out-of-body
33:43 experiences and you know these
33:46 experiences after they're pronounced
33:47 dead there's a lot more time involved
33:50 with that so it could be in the case of
33:53 my close friend he had enough oxygen in
33:57 his brain enough power in his brain that
34:00 there was no degradation to any
34:02 significant degree that would ever put
34:06 him on the journey out yet right they
34:08 were able to defibrillate him instantly
34:11 it was amazing I think he was only like
34:14 15 feet from the defibrillator with
34:18 doctors in the room with him and so they
34:21 got it popped him twice and he woke
34:23 Breck up and he I guarantee you there's
34:26 no sign he is suffered any problems with
34:31 that
34:31 mentally some people lose their mind a
34:36 little bit after a heart attack and he
34:40 is I think become more clear than I've
34:42 ever seen him it's great but what are
34:46 some of the experiences that we hear we
34:50 hear about tunnels of light we hear
34:53 about centers of light so you know like
34:56 some light being at the center of the
34:58 galaxy or something and they're just
35:00 flying towards it and it feels great the
35:02 tunnel feels great too for what I
35:03 understand but then we have these other
35:06 stories where there's none of that
35:08 someone comes to meet them and they go
35:12 off and have a small conversation and
35:16 then there's that phrase it's not your
35:19 time you're to go back
35:22 and what's utterly fascinating about
35:25 that statement is that you have people
35:29 of all ages from my tour my research is
35:32 an 8 year old all the way up to I don't
35:36 know how all saying this particular
35:39 group of people all saying that they've
35:40 had this person that they met tell them
35:44 that that's the case and what's
35:47 fascinating about it is their cases but
35:50 I have listened to and again I have a
35:52 strategically created a sample pool and
35:55 then dumb you know conducted by poll
35:58 I've just let her come in totally random
36:00 I have not personally heard anyone
36:05 claimed that they think they were
36:06 talking to God almost unanimously
36:10 they're talking to something that is the
36:13 equivalent of a humanoid or a human I
36:17 haven't heard anyone talk about an alien
36:20 so for me that's powerful I think for me
36:24 that is the most counterintuitive event
36:29 when compared to what we are taught as
36:32 human beings what are we taught as human
36:34 beings you know depending on your
36:36 religion it's not that we aren't taught
36:40 that humans will be on the other side
36:41 because I think that's what we do teach
36:43 each other because we don't want to
36:45 think about ourselves being disembodied
36:47 spirits that's uncomfortable to us well
36:50 we've never been a disembodied spirit
36:52 before except in our dreams right if
36:59 scientists were correct that the
37:01 afterlife is merely something that we
37:04 construct out of fairy tales on earth
37:06 religions of all types right then I
37:11 think that these stories would be a lot
37:14 different I think that a Christian would
37:18 almost certainly be greeted by Christ or
37:22 God himself and it would be a
37:25 Michelangelo painting of either person a
37:29 white guy one you know the gray hair guy
37:33 is dead and the brand
37:36 long hair guy is Christ but I am yet in
37:40 my life to ever hear someone say that
37:44 their near-death experience turned into
37:46 a Catholic or I should say a Christian
37:48 experience I haven't heard an Arab talk
37:51 about not that I've heard any but you
37:54 know why haven't we heard about the
37:55 meeting Allah and coming back well I
37:59 just met all the virgins and then came
38:01 back I haven't heard any that story yet
38:03 it's always a story that seems to match
38:08 everyone else's story I just say maybe
38:11 one of three stories right the tunnel
38:13 the white light and just straight up
38:16 meeting a person at a location
38:18 none of that spells pre indoctrination
38:23 at all and if one wants to say well the
38:26 brain goes into a dream state right
38:29 towards the end of life right then why
38:32 aren't there a lot more dreamy sort of
38:35 nonsensical experiences a lot of people
38:39 have reoccurring dreams why isn't
38:41 someone said well I had by a mile
38:43 reoccurring dream you know that guy's
38:45 always there that girl's always there
38:47 why haven't you just heard a complete
38:49 throwaway story there's no significance
38:51 whatsoever now about 25 years ago
38:57 somewhere in there I did read a report I
39:00 don't know where I got it I think it was
39:02 even on the television it's probably
39:03 scientific America or something where
39:04 someone had concocted this story that
39:09 there was a bunch of chemicals that
39:10 dumped into the brain right as you died
39:12 and that they could stimulate the visual
39:15 cortex into seeing a bunch of light now
39:19 the absurdity of such a claim is that
39:23 let's just say you did let's just say I
39:26 could give you a pill and it stimulated
39:28 that experience while you're perfectly
39:30 healthy or your life is not at risk but
39:33 it does what the scientist says what
39:36 would you see you just see a bunch of
39:38 light that's all you'd see you wouldn't
39:41 have this amazing beautiful feeling that
39:45 you're now in a different room about to
39:48 meet God or
39:49 to be in a much better place you would
39:53 just simply see light it wouldn't shape
39:55 in the form of a tunnel
39:57 it wouldn't shape in the form of a sort
39:59 of a galaxy looking object it would just
40:02 be light maybe you'd even be blinded you
40:06 know by light nope that's not what we
40:11 hear we hear contextual experiences and
40:14 there seems to be so much unification
40:18 and so much consistency between these
40:21 stories that it goes back in books
40:25 hundreds of years and it's been reused
40:27 in you know all kinds of Hollywood
40:31 television productions and the other one
40:35 that I find very very interesting and I
40:37 mentioned this in the last 10 episodes I
40:38 think is the woman who died 8:00 in the
40:43 early 50s I think it was like 54 or
40:46 something like that
40:47 so she's 8 year old in 1954 and for all
40:50 those kids that are young or
40:51 what-have-you
40:52 you can't immediately understand you
40:55 have to understand there's no
40:58 rock-and-roll music there's no computers
41:01 telephones still have operators you have
41:04 to talk to for them to punch in the call
41:07 and get you where you need to go fact
41:09 phone numbers are like seven digits or
41:11 five digits I mean it's crazy you still
41:14 have milkman okay this girl was in I
41:19 believe a car accident and she was an
41:23 older woman obviously when she was being
41:25 interviewed in the last couple of years
41:27 here and what was fascinating is when
41:31 she's recalling a story that she has
41:33 told her family since she woke up at 8
41:39 so she's not concocting the story here
41:42 in the next in the last couple years and
41:44 watching too much television and putting
41:46 together the story the story has a
41:48 lineage that is nearly 60 years old her
41:52 over six years old but she said that she
41:56 was met by a man who came to get her and
42:01 he was obviously some sort of
42:02 Eldar to her because he's a grown man
42:06 and she's a young girl she said in no
42:08 time was she fearful she felt wonderful
42:11 and then she said she was taken through
42:15 some sort of office some sort of
42:17 facility for those you watch Westworld
42:21 there you go she said they were glass
42:24 offices now I know that in the art deco
42:29 era we definitely had some glass offices
42:31 but I don't know if they were as pure
42:33 legal ass say the west-world you know
42:37 realm on the other side where you have
42:39 totally glass offices with no opaque
42:41 walls now when she was 8 she was telling
42:45 the story to her family in the 50s and
42:46 they could barely understand what she
42:48 was talking about today when I tell the
42:50 story it's gonna seem sort of like yeah
42:52 whatever but the significance is this
42:55 happened a long time ago
42:58 she said that they had something like
43:03 typewriters that they were typing on
43:06 except there was some display thing in
43:10 front of them a monitor and the keyboard
43:15 that they were typing on was flat as a
43:18 wafer like every computer keyboard that
43:21 we have today she also said that the
43:24 letters on the keyboards were backlit
43:26 with light and she said there was just a
43:31 bunch of these people and she was taking
43:33 it would be just as if you took
43:35 Westworld got rid of all of the host
43:38 rehabilitation and testing and creation
43:40 and just put offices in there with
43:41 normal computers with nice gamer
43:45 keyboards that are all backlit and she
43:49 was taken through this and eventually at
43:51 the end of the hallway he said you know
43:52 it's not your time you got to go back
43:54 down we have children who are born who
43:58 remember where they came from and they
44:02 have this incredible force this yearning
44:06 to go to these other geographical areas
44:08 usually not too far from where they're
44:10 born and they could name things named
44:14 people
44:15 and I want you to think about that for a
44:17 second for any of you who have kids
44:20 imagine your child coming to you and
44:22 saying mom dad we got to go visit my
44:27 relatives you know what you know they
44:30 live over there in a place called
44:33 so-and-so well who are these people
44:36 well Mike remembers my dad and my
44:39 brother and my sisters and my
44:41 grandmother and they live in this little
44:44 village now they won't get everything
44:47 right
44:48 in fact theirs but they they do get more
44:51 than 50 percent correct in fact the ones
44:54 I have seen since I was a kid and you
44:55 have to take some of this with a grain
44:56 of salt of course because television in
44:59 the 70s was sort of a joke you know
45:01 Leonard Nimoy's sort of mystery show was
45:06 definitely looking for content to
45:08 sensationalize to make us watch the show
45:10 look at the ads you know but there are
45:14 documented cases out there of these kids
45:16 and the last one I saw was I believe in
45:21 England where a little kid get just
45:24 about 50% of it correct but he also had
45:27 some he had the number of family members
45:29 correct he couldn't quite get the name
45:31 correct but the good name was very
45:33 similar to the name he kept the house
45:35 location correct exactly where it was
45:38 supposed to be on the coast and with the
45:39 lighthouse down the street and all that
45:41 kind of stuff I am NOT gonna go through
45:45 it again
45:45 but for those of you interested I think
45:49 probably reincarnation is the best place
45:50 to get it but you know there's my
45:52 encounter with Walt Disney at Disneyland
45:54 that's all I'll say about that
45:56 you heard it are absolutely done hearing
45:58 it for me personally that's it that's
46:04 totally it ghosts and demons from
46:07 episode one also has that story
46:11 another night episode by the way so the
46:14 big question that also comes up is is it
46:17 important that we know well if the
46:23 atheists are correct
46:25 well you die and that's it
46:28 it was beautiful that you were here but
46:31 it won't matter
46:32 especially won't matter to you because
46:34 you will simply cease to exist
46:37 again let's just rewind for those of you
46:40 just got a really weird how heart
46:41 palpitation on that level all the
46:44 evidence is that's not the case but
46:50 let's say there is an afterlife and we
46:51 all sit down and we you know again there
46:54 are certain governments that aren't so
46:55 anal about it you know we're sort of a
46:58 Christian based country over here let's
47:02 see you sort of get the extremes but
47:03 there's not a lot of you know
47:05 Christianity studies in the government
47:07 the government's looking at it all from
47:09 our very pragmatic standpoint but they
47:10 have done all kinds of experiments with
47:14 the human mind at the highest levels of
47:19 government because they want to know the
47:23 Russians have been really good about
47:25 being existential in their research and
47:29 then admitting it to us there's plenty
47:32 people who have come out of the
47:33 government said yeah we were studying
47:35 ESP you know I will get to remote
47:39 viewing at some point here soon because
47:42 there's a tremendous amount of evidence
47:46 that remote viewing works or you simply
47:50 acknowledge that your body is merely
47:52 your vessel you give your consciousness
47:54 much more credit than it has and you can
47:58 put it anywhere in the universe that you
48:00 want to I forgot who said it but someone
48:03 was asked whether or not you could
48:05 without the government could travel the
48:07 Stars to travel the galaxy without the
48:10 IDS covert technology and their answer
48:13 was something to the degree that as long
48:17 as you have your consciousness there's
48:20 no better way to get around the universe
48:22 just use it you know but how would you
48:26 live your life if you knew there was a
48:28 spiritual realm
48:31 now we answer this question in
48:33 reincarnation but that was a complete
48:35 ecosystem idea in this conversation were
48:41 just
48:41 about there is something other than this
48:45 existence
48:46 well now it's interesting is I had a
48:50 friend of mine who just lost her stepdad
48:53 very emotional experience super guy
48:56 super loved by Hall a real man's man and
49:03 of course it's always traumatic and this
49:05 person had been suffering for several
49:07 years of an ailment that got him in the
49:09 end and we sat around afterwards and
49:13 discussed where he was and the beautiful
49:18 thing was is that I didn't have to
49:20 convince her that there was something on
49:23 the other side
49:24 she's spiritual raised traditionally you
49:28 know Christian and then sorta you know
49:30 as her own modifications to that she
49:34 even had some indications why should
49:36 rewind here one second this guy was cool
49:40 enough with his wife before he passed
49:42 that they actually sat down and did what
49:44 Houdini and his wife did and Yoko Ono
49:47 and John Lennon did which is to say
49:49 let's agree on some signs let's agree on
49:53 some signs that if I can contact you
49:56 from the other side I will and they came
49:59 up with a few things I don't know if I
50:01 know them all but one of the things that
50:04 they said was I will it's interesting he
50:08 said I will become a white butterfly and
50:11 I'll land next to you and that's exactly
50:16 what happened outside the hospital the
50:20 day he passed away they were both at his
50:21 side when he passed and a white
50:23 butterfly was right there and it was so
50:26 efficient that it was almost too early
50:29 and too efficient to just accept and
50:32 believe now I sit in this backyard right
50:36 I record dozens of these shows I've done
50:39 it for two years when were in the same
50:43 area of California here I can't say I've
50:47 ever seen a white butterfly I see tons
50:50 of monarch butterflies and all kinds of
50:52 other butterflies but mostly white ones
50:54 so I think that's pretty
50:56 there was also this moment of because in
51:01 my experience you know my grandmother
51:03 passed away I keep telling you guys that
51:05 I had this vision of her and she told me
51:07 I'm on the other side and I'm okay I
51:08 just want you to know and I had
51:10 forgotten that she was sick enough to
51:13 pass away so I didn't have this fear in
51:16 my mind oh my god grandma my die any day
51:18 now I didn't I did complete forgotten in
51:21 fact I don't think anyone he ever told
51:22 me that she was close to death she was
51:25 getting dementia that was the most she
51:27 ever had right but I didn't understand
51:29 how dementia equals death at the time
51:30 right in the two hours later my mom
51:33 called me told me and I was like okay
51:34 yeah I think I knew this already but my
51:39 friends she had just gone to this
51:42 dramatic experience of losing him in the
51:44 room holding his hand and of course the
51:49 nurses come in and start to do the sort
51:52 of preparations after death and she just
51:56 needed to get out of of the hospital and
51:59 she said that she went downstairs out
52:02 the front door and the second she walked
52:04 out the front door the Sun hit her and
52:08 she is in one of these sort of states of
52:12 shock you know she has held someone
52:15 else's hand before they believe her
52:18 grandmother so she been through this
52:21 before not that it gets any easier
52:23 necessarily but you know a little bit of
52:29 experiences a lot more than none and she
52:33 said she walked out the Sun hit her and
52:34 she had this amazing feeling wash over
52:38 her but it was a gorgeous day everything
52:43 was okay and she says she just had this
52:45 euphoric wave passed through her body
52:48 and so you know probably one of the most
52:53 definitive moments in her life was
52:55 saying goodbye to him and now she is
52:58 sort of in the complete opposite
52:59 polarity to that moment on all
53:01 dimensional levels of all of her senses
53:04 everything was fine everything was
53:06 wonderful and everything was beautiful
53:09 now you know a few minutes later the
53:14 situation came back and you know she
53:17 went back into the sort of normal
53:19 mourning process but I thought when I
53:23 was hearing her say that I told her I
53:24 said look I think that's him you never
53:28 had a pact with him as to what you would
53:30 see even though she did see the white
53:32 butterfly I think John Lennon said he
53:36 would be a feather and he'd float across
53:37 the room I've seen feathers float across
53:41 rooms in my various homes I've been in
53:43 and the interesting thing was I didn't
53:46 have any feathers in my clothing didn't
53:48 any feathers in my bedding my pillows
53:50 and I didn't know how did a feather get
53:54 over my head in a room with just almost
53:56 nothing in it besides a dresser and and
53:59 there's my bed
54:00 and some [ __ ] on the floor right and
54:03 this feather is so high that it's
54:06 floating down in front of me I think
54:10 that's interesting if you were on the
54:12 other side and you knew that you were
54:16 fine but you're watching your loved ones
54:19 mourn your death what gift would you
54:23 give them and I think that the logical
54:28 answer is solace peace a moment that
54:33 says it's okay it's okay
54:37 I can't sit here and interfere with your
54:39 life your whole life so I got a all I
54:41 can do is pass you this emotion in a
54:43 finite little box of time then I gotta
54:46 go because it's not my right to mess
54:48 with you but I want you to this one
54:51 moment and I want to have it so close to
54:52 my death that it seems absurd that you
54:55 had it in the first place thus giving
54:58 you a little bit of logic to say that
55:01 couldn't have happened do you know
55:04 someone might say as a psychologist
55:05 there's a huge pent-up level of trauma
55:10 and negativity and so chemically you
55:12 could have walked outside taking a deep
55:14 exhale we had this chemical supply of
55:19 negativity vanish
55:21 but I even struggled with that notion of
55:24 being true I do know people that believe
55:28 in the afterlife that have no definition
55:31 of it that haven't indicated to me that
55:37 they think in these more metaphysical
55:38 ways perhaps they do and they're just
55:41 unable to articulate it to us maybe it
55:44 is that a straight fear of death of
55:47 others they want to believe people
55:50 aren't good places
55:51 maybe I'm sure that exists - there's a
55:55 lot of things we question in this world
55:57 and there's a lot of conclusions from
56:00 all angles right it could be that a
56:03 person who has a knee-jerk reaction is
56:05 going with their instincts they're
56:07 Gnostic pipeline to the universe and
56:09 they're a thousand percent correct but
56:11 if you ask them why they think they're
56:14 correct they can explain it to you they
56:16 just know it's a nice piece of
56:19 information it's not really it's not
56:22 terribly great for conversation because
56:26 there is none they just have a feeling
56:28 right but let me give you this and this
56:33 is sort of an extension off of the
56:34 reincarnation thinking process but we'll
56:37 again not really try to go to the
56:38 ecosystem of it all for me you know when
56:43 I talk about the plants that are my
56:45 backyard the way I view the plant is
56:49 that it's the same exact plant as the
56:53 first plant it's just continued to
56:56 evolve and it is turned into a fern
57:01 versus a rosebush versus a palm tree
57:04 versus a vine or something but it's all
57:08 from some original systemic moment of
57:13 life we know we personally come from a
57:17 huge strain of life some mysterious
57:20 thing that no scientist has ever ever
57:25 described accurately they guess right
57:28 the primordial ooze that's hit by a
57:31 lightning Boulder there's some chemical
57:32 electrical reaction and the
57:34 suddenly we exist right just happen on a
57:37 ball of dirt when we talk about
57:40 afterlife we're essentially using the
57:44 word life which is the spark the moment
57:47 the singularity of our consciousness
57:50 right I can't think of anything more
57:55 divine than life and there is the
58:03 chicken and egg argument of whether or
58:05 not life is just simply always existed
58:08 as in God if we want to say the central
58:11 lifeforce or whether or not somehow it
58:15 you know serendipitously popped out of
58:17 the universe but what I'm getting at is
58:20 the following I think life is probably
58:24 the one commodity in the universe that
58:27 is the that has the highest value on the
58:30 little you know stock exchange of
58:34 commodities that is the universe
58:37 consciousness is the byproduct of life
58:40 it's sort of one in the same obviously
58:44 depending on the vessel that the life is
58:46 inspiring you might get a higher level
58:48 of consciousness or a lower level of
58:50 consciousness in sex certainly seem
58:54 smart don't they one of the things I
58:56 forgot to mention in a previous episode
58:58 is anyone of you who've studied ants
59:04 especially the ones that like red like
59:07 fire ants for instance so as they get
59:09 bogged down with water like these floods
59:11 that are going on in the Gulf they make
59:14 these little islands right they all act
59:16 together and they make islands and the
59:18 ants on the bottom have work with water
59:21 tension to create little bubbles around
59:23 their heads so when they stick their
59:25 bodies down to create the foundation on
59:27 top of the water tension they can still
59:29 breathe their brains are infinitesimally
59:36 tiny SuperDuper tiny and yet a couple
59:40 things are occurring as an individual
59:43 they are utterly brilliant
59:46 I mean I think that their instincts and
59:48 their programming which is what a
59:50 evolutionist might just lean on is mega
59:54 brilliant right because let's face it
59:58 there are plenty of ants that have lived
60:00 that have probably never been forced to
60:02 create the little island thing they live
60:04 such a short little life they don't have
60:08 that there's probably brood queens that
60:11 have always been a nice arid desert
60:12 communities dirt soil and yeah does rain
60:16 and what-have-you but they don't have to
60:18 create the island thing but all of them
60:21 know how to do it
60:22 this second they need to do it now if
60:26 you look at them and draw a line around
60:29 every single ant from a particular brew
60:31 belonging to a particular queen and just
60:34 fill it in like a 3d model you
60:38 essentially have sort of like a an
60:40 amoebic sort of maybe even a squid with
60:44 several legs on it where they go off and
60:47 venture and find food and come back and
60:48 they leave the to scent trails one is
60:50 the search trail one is the I found food
60:52 trail love the scent they laid down for
60:57 those of you who said heed the ants that
60:59 are in the jungle that create these
61:01 beautiful bridges from one place to the
61:04 other
61:04 they're trying to cross a certain amount
61:07 of terrain looking for a home now the
61:09 weird thing is how they how they
61:12 determine whether or not they found the
61:13 home or not is really interesting oh
61:15 this is good this isn't good this is
61:16 good so there's some extra thing going
61:19 on that says this is good for the Queen
61:20 let's move or now lots of food in this
61:23 other place or whatever shelter
61:25 these little guys work together and they
61:27 make these bridges out of their bodies
61:29 in dry areas and then they make the
61:31 little raft to get across the pond and
61:34 they make more bridges they seem to be
61:37 acting as a single level of
61:38 consciousness but we always refer to as
61:42 the insect hive mind for me it's more
61:45 brilliant than honey bees the honey bees
61:47 are pretty damn amazing we now know how
61:48 they wiggle their tails is how they
61:50 communicate with each other about
61:51 exactly how far to go in a particular
61:52 direction isn't that phenomenal right
61:56 but that seems like a just a increase
61:58 will
61:59 between the individual or as an ant
62:01 seems like you can't think for itself
62:03 both have Queens both have broods but
62:08 ants have something very special and
62:10 again there's teeny tiny ants that are
62:13 like microscopic you know I don't mean
62:16 that literally but you know there's a
62:17 little tiny black ants that are super
62:19 tiny well think about it big their brain
62:20 is but scientists are saying in order to
62:23 have that level of intelligence you need
62:24 a big giant container of gray matter but
62:30 if life is a symbiotic thing your vessel
62:34 really doesn't matter you just need a
62:35 connection point although Ethernet cable
62:37 that goes down inside that and whirlwind
62:41 of ether will mass and then it gets
62:45 however much intelligence it gets from
62:48 the universe
62:49 you know man gets bored of patterns
62:52 right like I told you in my last episode
62:55 a couple episodes back I got friends
62:57 that got bored of California moved to
62:58 Texas a whole bunch of them like half a
63:02 dozen of them all childhood friends Hall
63:05 went to Texas well that boredom pattern
63:10 is where we define frontiers if you are
63:14 bored of or you think you have enough
63:16 information about a particular subject
63:18 you go off to a different subject and
63:20 it's a frontier the mind and
63:23 consciousness is a frontier for a lot of
63:26 us right that's why you listen to me we
63:28 dialogue back and forth through the
63:30 discussions on YouTube on Facebook but
63:35 what kind of concerns me in a positive
63:37 way is that we have never really
63:40 institutionalized I'm sure this has
63:44 occurred but it's not like in the common
63:46 you know household words we have not
63:50 come together as a society as a as a
63:52 human race and formalize the research in
63:57 the afterlife I mean really really put
64:01 it in every major universities got an
64:03 afterlife Research Center there's a lot
64:07 of consciousness research centers which
64:10 they call philosophy
64:12 groups right but what could we deduce if
64:16 we were to say okay we're gonna lay down
64:17 a bunch of rules about what sort of data
64:20 gets submitted into our pool if there's
64:23 some hearsay from someone well okay we
64:26 need to kind of know that that story was
64:27 repeated a long time ago like the woman
64:29 who claims to have had the her
64:31 experience at the age of eight the more
64:34 that her relatives who were side by side
64:36 with her perhaps a brother who was 10 an
64:39 uncle that wrote about it someone wrote
64:41 in a diary about her whatever the more
64:44 they can back up her story than her
64:45 story gets submitted into the group into
64:48 the literally Research Center about all
64:51 this stuff I remember growing up as a
64:54 kid and they they had these photographs
64:57 that they had taken two people who had
64:58 died in the 1800's in the early nineteen
65:01 hundreds and there's all these
65:03 photographs that supposedly so show a
65:06 soul escaping the body as a cloud of
65:09 energy something that would disrupt the
65:13 light in the room such that the camera
65:15 could track the photons very interesting
65:20 this was also on the time when if you
65:22 moved during a photograph your face was
65:24 blurry so you never know what kind of
65:28 anomalies could have snuck in the camera
65:30 those photographs would be interesting
65:32 to study to come up with debunking
65:35 theories of how it could have occurred
65:37 in the camera without it being a soul
65:40 but we need another group in our control
65:43 study like the control group is going to
65:45 debunk the other philosophical
65:47 existential group is going to say you
65:51 know where did the soul leave the body
65:53 did it leave the gut did you leave the
65:54 brain physically let's this
65:56 geometrically break down these
65:58 photographs and take a look what other
66:00 similar experiences are there can we go
66:03 to a hospice where people don't have
66:06 anyone we can comfort them and be their
66:08 friends and and we either can tell them
66:12 or we don't tell them that we're gonna
66:14 be with them until the very end
66:16 you fill their room with tons of cameras
66:18 super-sensitive infrared light
66:20 everything you could possibly imagine
66:22 so that when they pass away we see
66:26 something what's really interesting
66:29 about universities right now sort of a
66:31 related digression would be well they
66:36 put this way in the last couple weeks I
66:39 have heard an echoing statement in
66:42 YouTube videos and it's why these things
66:45 when someone teaches you a word here the
66:46 word all the time this is one of these
66:48 moments for me and then I've heard a lot
66:50 of folks say stop going to college stop
66:56 going to college because you're gonna
66:57 get a shitty degree that doesn't do
66:58 anything for it you get a bunch of debts
67:00 we always see on the show all right if
67:03 you know what you want to do you should
67:05 go to college get that degree in a trade
67:07 skill come out and get your career if
67:09 you don't know yet what you want to do
67:11 hold off why spend a bunch of money when
67:14 you don't know what you're doing just
67:15 chill out
67:16 don't worry about society saying you
67:18 gotta go to college now or else go get a
67:20 job figure out what it's like to hate
67:22 not having knowledge but now think about
67:26 what we're talking here talking about
67:27 here and think about everything we've
67:29 ever talked about on this show it's sort
67:30 of like this right think about how
67:34 excited you would be to go to university
67:36 if in going to university and getting
67:40 your trade skill you had these more as
67:42 existential classes I know they're they
67:46 exist you know and again some of you may
67:48 have been fortunate enough to run into
67:49 something like this but I can't imagine
67:51 them ever being really that formal right
67:54 I didn't go into the Stanford bookstore
67:56 for God eight years straight and find
68:01 books on the afterlife
68:02 I didn't tons on philosophy but not the
68:06 afterlife unless it was some sort of
68:08 related to Egyptology related to some
68:11 other thing for those of you who believe
68:14 in a flat earth think about it how
68:16 excited would it be to go to a college
68:19 that would teach Flat Earth as much as
68:21 the teachers around Earth or globe earth
68:24 or expanding earth to open up the mind
68:32 interesting thing about the afterlife as
68:35 it relates the things like what shape
68:38 the earth is is that when you talk to
68:41 someone who's so sure what shape it is
68:43 either way they find out at least at
68:47 first before they do the deep dive that
68:50 they have a belief usually heliocentric
68:52 globe but they have no visual proof
68:55 themselves that it is such a way it
68:59 makes sense to them but they're only
69:01 proof and that they're willing to
69:03 believe I think that's interesting why
69:08 do we struggle so much with the
69:10 existential mindset of afterlife it's
69:15 because people that we are supposed to
69:17 trust through pavel oni and training
69:19 scientists with a capital s right the
69:23 new ever evolving religion is sort of
69:27 saying if well if you think that that's
69:29 fine but you don't know anything
69:31 we know everything bone your brain is
69:35 washed washed out by the force of their
69:38 assertion their confidence their
69:41 misplaced confidence i think i said in
69:45 one of the first few episodes i did in
69:48 season one that the more i dove into
69:53 philosophy and started reading some of
69:56 the masters they would always seem to
69:59 come to the same conclusion i knew i had
70:03 become intelligent when i realized that
70:06 I didn't know anything about anything
70:09 and how is it that the most privileged
70:13 people on planet earth they could go
70:14 they could go to university their whole
70:16 life because they were wealthy they were
70:18 sons of at the time back in the day was
70:22 only men but they were sons of
70:26 aristocrats with plenty of money they
70:28 sat in universities and they still
70:29 concluded that they figured out that
70:33 their certainties were all full of
70:35 various assertions of dogma that there
70:38 was a lot of security blankets that they
70:39 were hanging on to they loved the
70:41 euphoric feeling of being
70:45 the self-deluded about their
70:47 intelligence and when they finally grew
70:49 up and became intelligent and
70:51 enlightened they decided well I only
70:56 have a hint of an idea of how it could
70:58 be right I say that because for those of
71:04 you who have angst about someone else
71:06 walking in the room metaphorically and
71:09 saying no way it can't exist I'm a
71:12 scientist you have room to laugh there
71:17 at least on the inside that they almost
71:22 almost in fatica Li have proven that
71:26 they haven't reached that higher level
71:29 of intellect that all of the
71:30 predecessors of ours have concluded that
71:34 they didn't know anything you know we're
71:36 not there yet they're on the way maybe
71:38 they can live long enough continue
71:41 studying and be humble have some
71:43 humiliation right I think it was in my
71:48 episode on program universe I think
71:51 where I kind of touched on this subject
71:54 and I said something I think it's
71:58 important to repeat now which is one of
72:01 the most frustrating policies of the
72:03 universe is that the afterlife is not
72:06 allowed to communicate with us in a
72:07 blatant way right you don't go home to
72:12 my knowledge let me know if you've had a
72:13 different experience but you don't go
72:15 home after you're after you've lost
72:18 someone to death mortal death or human
72:22 death I should say and you don't find
72:24 them spiritually sitting in a chair in
72:26 your living room hey man what's up nice
72:29 place you know I couldn't visit your
72:31 place because I was stuck in the
72:32 hospital the last two years it's good to
72:34 see hey and now I finally understand
72:36 what the hell you're doing for a living
72:37 you keep telling me and you know I
72:39 founded my head but I really didn't
72:40 understand what you're doing but I've
72:41 had some time to study and now I know
72:43 what you're doing and you know what I
72:45 had an idea boom boom boom right and
72:48 that's frustrating for those of you like
72:52 me who want to know if there's an
72:53 afterlife would be nice to just have a
72:56 little bit of proof
72:57 I think I've seen my proof my own
73:01 personal experience I didn't have to die
73:03 to get it doesn't have to be injured to
73:05 get it I just have Walt Disney say Bob
73:07 where's over there go see him the thing
73:12 is is we're so manipulated by fear
73:14 aren't we what I don't know is this is a
73:18 digression but it's related you know
73:22 animals are constantly freaked out
73:23 aren't they it's probably one of the
73:26 most frustrating things in the
73:27 relationship between man and animal but
73:30 it happens between them you see a cute
73:33 bird you know my house is surrounded by
73:37 dozens and dozens of hummingbirds
73:42 they're beautiful they're tiny they're
73:44 cute they look like they couldn't hurt
73:47 you if you if they tried right and you'd
73:51 love to have them you know do a little
73:52 zippity-doo-dah and land on your
73:54 shoulder and chill out with you land on
73:56 the microphone stand here and chirp
73:58 what's up but they don't insects
74:02 soon as they see only a few insects will
74:04 pursue you black widow will chase your
74:06 ass in the backyard it's funny and so
74:09 man has a privilege of having created a
74:11 world around himself in such a way that
74:15 we can actually have a break from fear
74:19 in fact most of us live our lives
74:21 outside of the predominant feeling of
74:24 fear there's always micro you know
74:28 particles of fear in us for one thing or
74:31 the other now we're using our time
74:33 wisely or we with the right person or
74:35 the right job blah blah blah blah you
74:37 know when there's hundreds of books
74:40 about how we all have to fear death
74:41 otherwise were stupid it's such a bad
74:44 assertion right but it's important you
74:48 know if we were to create this research
74:49 group to study the afterlife I think it
74:53 would be almost an instantaneous
74:57 location on planet earth where we would
75:01 divorce ourselves from the paradigm of
75:04 fear it would be quarantined from fear
75:07 we simply want to know is there an
75:10 afterlife
75:12 what I want for you is that solace is
75:16 that peace in your soul this is between
75:21 you and you I had someone tell me once
75:26 that one of the most impossible things
75:33 to prove is a no and I think we were
75:36 talking about the existence of Christ a
75:37 really long time ago this is before I
75:40 had any falling out of the belief of him
75:44 existing but they said you know you
75:47 really can't prove that people existed
75:51 in the past
75:52 you can only deduce the people existed
75:56 from the past and I think that this
76:03 world has been beautifully and amazingly
76:06 designed in such that there's no risk of
76:11 us really ever finding it out for sure
76:13 you know completely blatantly for sure
76:17 the the mezzanine in the middle of that
76:21 certainty or you know near-death
76:25 experiences where people see things on
76:27 the other side and come back but think
76:30 about how that gets told let's say one
76:34 of our listeners has an issue and they
76:36 they pass out on a operating table and
76:39 they have this experience it's fresh in
76:42 their mind they just watch this episode
76:43 this unfortunate thing occurs with them
76:45 and fortunately they are revived and
76:48 they come to us in the chats and all the
76:51 messages and they say look man I died
76:53 and I saw this this and this and it just
76:56 happened all right maybe it's was really
76:59 cool and so they know everything about
77:01 you know everyone was in the room or
77:04 something that you know no one else they
77:05 could have never known they were knocked
77:07 out before they went into the ER and
77:09 they still saw everything so able to
77:13 almost circumstantially prove that they
77:16 were alive again if you look at my
77:18 episode that's
77:20 about the census you know if the
77:22 epidermis could become an eyeball then
77:25 maybe there's a reason why we can see
77:27 things in a room with our eyes but those
77:30 experiences happen to the individual
77:32 when no one else is there right so if if
77:38 that was let's just put a tongue in the
77:41 cheek here and say what if that was just
77:43 a bug in the system an anomaly that
77:46 happens you know one and a hundred
77:50 million people have this experience I
77:52 don't even know what the odds are be
77:53 interesting to know that all is in our
77:54 nice Research Center we might be
77:56 creating here but the bug is allowed to
77:59 keep going because it's quarantined the
78:02 QA team looks at it and says well yeah
78:05 that does happen every once in a while
78:06 but you know what no one's around to
78:11 confirm it so yeah you know and then
78:16 later on we find out they can say things
78:17 like oh you know that pen you were
78:19 looking for in the ER was over there
78:21 was behind the door on the ground right
78:22 oh yeah it was how the hell'd you know
78:24 that well I was floating above the
78:26 operating table I saw everything and I
78:28 heard what you said about my mother
78:30 whoever designed this designed this to
78:33 protect this from all the other stuff
78:36 but again we can peek into it and there
78:41 you know again I've definitely talked to
78:45 enough people that have had the
78:46 experience I have with my grandmother
78:48 passing where you get notified by them
78:52 after they pass right mothers again like
78:55 I've always said having this incredible
78:57 connection with their kids we're gonna
79:00 have to get clever to prove this if it
79:06 can be proved
79:08 it's a frontier we're hardly the first
79:12 to parse it if the world was truly
79:15 totally different back in the past and
79:18 the spirits walked among us I can't
79:21 describe why that would have gone away
79:24 why would it have gone away maybe I
79:28 can't describe it maybe it's because of
79:30 the indoctrination that closes our minds
79:32 right
79:33 I always think about people who say they
79:35 see auras it's not a sign of the
79:39 afterlife in any way shape or form but
79:41 it's an interesting litmus test that's
79:43 people say they can see it I had a
79:47 couple relatives of mine they got really
79:49 into this aunt and uncle they got super
79:50 into this and they're no dummies and
79:53 there was like these retreats you could
79:55 go out to and they would teach you how
79:57 to see auras which very fascinating I
79:59 wish I had the kind of money just to sit
80:01 around and do that kind of stuff motive
80:05 man saw auras when things were more
80:07 peaceful and I don't mean war as the
80:12 alternative to peace I just mean yeah
80:14 maybe there wasn't too much to do plenty
80:16 of fresh water and food whatever kept us
80:19 alive and you just kind of sit and chill
80:21 and relax you get to know each other and
80:23 roll up some tobacco leaves and have a
80:26 good time right but what if things got
80:29 busy more people were born there's a lot
80:33 more stuff to do now you know the food
80:35 that grows off the trees well it's not
80:37 quite enough for the village plus we're
80:39 picking that [ __ ] willy nilly there's no
80:41 policy about how many you know whatever
80:46 peaches or apples or whatever you can
80:47 pull off and take for yourself dates and
80:52 so they're you know society starts
80:55 speeding up it starts having to behave
80:57 like the ants and go out and for forage
80:59 and find things and you know fruits die
81:04 really fast and vegetables die really
81:06 fast and so we switched to meat because
81:08 we can cure it and we could turn it into
81:10 beef jerky you know somebody found a
81:13 dried out animal it was killed by
81:16 something else and they started just go
81:18 see if I could still eat this meat and
81:20 they do and it tastes good and they feel
81:21 like they got some nourishment they got
81:24 the energy from the protein and the meat
81:26 and so the institutionalize that process
81:29 but life gets busy and the idea of
81:33 seeing an aura to exist the school chill
81:36 relaxed small little colony no longer
81:39 can not me no longer can see it because
81:41 more and more kids are born and instead
81:45 of teaching them to see or
81:46 or if they can see them when they're
81:48 born they get so sped up in society that
81:51 they lose the need to see them there's
81:53 no real well they lose the benefit of
81:56 seeing them to know that someone is
81:57 happy or sad or healthy or unhealthy
81:59 right there are Egyptian Masons that are
82:04 Arabic and/or Arab I should say they're
82:07 not a language they're Arabs in the
82:09 local area and they said that the
82:11 doctors who ran the hospitals which have
82:13 been misunderstood as temples according
82:15 to them so that they could see the aura
82:18 of man and they could see exactly how
82:21 fit or unfit you were and they could
82:24 draw upon the electricity created by the
82:26 pyramids into the catacombs down below
82:29 using a metal rod through the plateau
82:32 down into the electrified water and they
82:34 would simply expose you to a frequency
82:36 of electricity to rebalance your aura
82:38 and that's how they knew you were
82:40 healthy you know whatever color was
82:43 healthy you weren't that color and then
82:45 I guess there were just a little bit of
82:46 color mixing you know get the Home Depot
82:48 they got you all fixed up and you went
82:50 about your way
82:52 well if man ever had an atomistic phase
82:54 has been as it's been told to us by
82:58 several ancient tribes or the spirits
83:01 and the humans go together and again
83:02 Mexico has the day of the dead man and
83:05 that was a whole different religion
83:08 before the Spanish moved in of course
83:09 Mexicans are a crossbreed of the Spanish
83:13 and the local groups but I'm sure that
83:15 the day of the day comes from whatever
83:17 precursor was there before Christianity
83:20 moved in and built the the missions
83:24 perhaps they had a better relationship
83:27 you know now it's odd that that event
83:31 goes on top of Halloween because it
83:32 seems like Halloween is not what you
83:34 think it is in closing I'm gonna say
83:37 this this is sort of a related
83:40 perspective I've been developing through
83:44 doing this show especially in having
83:46 conversations with you guys I have a
83:48 close friend who believes in angels in a
83:52 huge way huge way he believes all of the
83:58 allegorical stories
84:00 about fallen angels that the devil was a
84:03 fallen angel and I love talking to him
84:08 one cuz he's just a brilliant guy in his
84:10 own right
84:11 whatever he's come up with is well
84:14 thought out regardless if you agree with
84:16 him or not but he still lives within his
84:20 paradigm which is fine
84:22 but the notion that and this this kind
84:25 of speaks to what would be on the other
84:26 side right by the way if you guys wanna
84:30 my conversation about what is actually
84:32 on the other side go see the
84:34 reincarnation episode II don't want to
84:36 regurgitate that we were studying right
84:39 now the conversation related to whether
84:42 or not we think there's something after
84:44 this world what's after that is anyone's
84:46 guess and I have a logical thing that
84:50 I've put together in that episode for me
84:51 personally but listening to these
84:55 stories about angels falling and then
84:57 sort of disrupting God's world you know
85:01 making us sinful and that sort of thing
85:03 and now there's a whole wave of logic
85:07 that it says to have choice you must
85:09 have more than one option and it's
85:14 important when you live your life by the
85:15 way that you always understand what your
85:19 choices are and believe that there are
85:21 choices doesn't mean to run away from
85:23 everything because that's how we get a
85:24 bunch of divorce people right but the
85:28 notion that there is some Supreme Being
85:30 that created the universe and is
85:32 everything and always has been
85:33 everything right Prince wrote a great
85:37 song that was released and then pulled
85:39 after death it's called I am if you guys
85:43 want to hear a great lyric about God and
85:46 the absolute of his existence go listen
85:49 to that song the lyrics are tremendous
85:50 you brought just look up the lyrics
85:51 without hearing the song but it's been
85:53 pulled from iTunes because their
85:55 contracts and dispute with the family
85:56 but they're so I got a copy of it but
86:00 for those of you pre-ordered it on face
86:03 are not face book on iTunes you got a
86:05 copy of it too but the idea that we have
86:08 a creator that is subjugated to his own
86:10 creation
86:13 is sort of a logic problem for me you
86:18 know if the devil were to exist for
86:19 instance for those of you who are
86:20 spiritual because it sort of enters into
86:23 the afterlife and you know whether or
86:25 not there's a heaven in hell and that
86:26 sort of thing again there's not a lot of
86:29 religions that have that absolute
86:31 paradigm outside of Christianity but the
86:36 idea that there's again someone who can
86:38 operate outside of the control of God is
86:41 just an impossibility for me it's an
86:44 absolute impossibility and it doesn't
86:47 again this is all Christian based
86:49 thinking but I live my life completely
86:53 outside of any indoctrination of those
86:58 Heaven and Hell precepts now and I don't
87:03 believe in a devil the way that we've
87:05 had it defined to us you know I have an
87:09 episode on Satan if you guys want to
87:10 watch that one to make sure watch some
87:12 one about God as well but what I am now
87:16 dealing with is this belief that there
87:18 is an incredible responsibility on our
87:20 shoulders and being alive obviously in
87:25 being an integral person and not
87:27 stepping on other people to get what we
87:29 want not hurting another soul to get one
87:31 of our agendas through we're not perfect
87:34 we cross those lines every once in a
87:36 while probably cross it traffic without
87:39 even knowing it cut someone off and you
87:41 have no idea did it but again
87:44 intent is the biggest form of sin
87:46 doesn't mean being ignorant as to your
87:48 excuse but you know what we should try
87:51 you're pretty well balanced I believe
87:54 beyond the shadow of a doubt that our
87:56 life force is protected by design I
88:04 think that the infinitesimal amount of
88:08 science that we've been able to squeeze
88:10 out of our existence on this planet also
88:12 proves that regardless of how big the
88:16 container is that is the universe
88:18 whether you think of it as in a
88:20 spiritual way or in a physical way
88:21 whether you think it's under a flat on a
88:24 flat disk under a firmament or on a ball
88:26 in
88:27 a small speck you can't hide anywhere
88:31 right it can hide from another being him
88:35 and I go behind the moon and you can't
88:36 see me but it doesn't make you not exist
88:38 simply because someone else puts the
88:40 hand over their eyes and says I can't
88:42 see you you don't exist
88:43 lalala right there's this famous saying
88:47 from the Bible as it is above so - it is
88:50 it below and I wanted to mention that
88:53 because people try to be literal about
88:57 that in that there's an ocean down below
88:59 and so there's ocean above the firmament
89:01 that kind of stuff I don't think that's
89:03 what that means just so you know when I
89:08 did my episode on gravity I forgot to
89:11 mention I mean I said that phrase but I
89:14 forgot to really drive at home and that
89:16 I think that what that means is that the
89:19 orbital patterns of mass in a tiny level
89:21 it's exactly like the orbital paths that
89:24 we see up above galaxies and solar
89:28 systems and all that good stuff
89:30 the analogy might be more absolute than
89:33 we're willing to acknowledge the movie
89:37 Tron from 1982 did a unbelievably
89:41 beautiful beautiful job of illustrating
89:45 this as it is above so - it is it below
89:49 for those of you who missed the first
89:51 film which is a ton of you you have a
89:56 human being who is digitized and sapped
89:59 inside of a computer and then he meets
90:01 programs programs that humans wrote and
90:05 there's a point in the third act where
90:07 Tron is talking to Flynn and he says to
90:12 him you know if you're a user which is a
90:15 god to them then this has all been
90:18 according to a plan and Jeff Bridges
90:22 said you wish
90:24 he says what are you talking about he
90:26 goes well it's like you know you gotta
90:30 flow with the punches man and the the
90:34 director Stephen lists burgers you know
90:36 directed the scene he wrote the script
90:37 and directed the scene beautifully in
90:39 that Tron
90:40 looked at him and never really quite
90:41 understood what he was saying it was
90:44 sort of outside the realm of the program
90:46 to understand and believe that the users
90:51 could be anything other than so
90:53 brilliant that they built the world they
90:56 built the programs and how could there
90:59 be any flaws outside of their realm
91:01 isn't it perfect up there for me that
91:05 little scene when they're on the solar
91:07 sailer towards the end headed towards
91:09 the mCP is one of the most brilliant
91:12 sort of knowing concepts in my life on a
91:16 daily basis when I think about it and I
91:18 think oh [ __ ] you know what if it is
91:21 pretty pretty dynamic in the afterlife
91:25 as well that perhaps I mean I would hate
91:28 to think that there's any sort of war in
91:30 the afterlife or any sort of discontent
91:33 and you're fighting your own personal
91:36 demons and the other side and that sort
91:38 of thing but then again as I said in my
91:41 reincarnation episode if you were to die
91:44 and become a soul you know just be
91:46 reduced your soul you don't have your
91:48 mortal coil anymore for now maybe you're
91:50 reborn and let's just say let's say you
91:52 go to heaven and you are bestowed with
91:55 all of the knowledge of the universe all
91:58 of it its history its meaning there's no
92:03 mathematical equation you don't know
92:05 there's no language in the universe
92:06 spoken by an alien or you or whatever
92:09 that you don't know you know what it's
92:11 like to be that spider and that ant a
92:14 hundred percent well you would lock up
92:18 in two seconds
92:19 because choice would be gone for you
92:21 forever and maybe there's some crack
92:24 cocaine you can do up there and enjoy
92:27 being totally knowledgeable about
92:29 everything but I think in the end there
92:32 is room for the afterlife to have a
92:35 similar form of life that we have here
92:38 but like I said in the reincarnation
92:40 episode think about it what would be the
92:43 value of life if you could never lose it
92:46 you might just choose to go back down
92:49 inside some limited vessel to re-educate
92:53 yourself
92:54 about the value of life I hope this was
92:59 valuable for you guys this is a good
93:01 night episode I think it's better than
93:04 my other one mother one is a pretty neat
93:07 little soundtrack on the front but the
93:08 episodes kind of willy-nilly I did
93:11 create a night episode in season 2 but
93:18 after listening to it back I just
93:20 thought it was not good enough to put
93:21 out for those of you who are new to the
93:24 show there's a website deep thoughts
93:26 radio.com
93:27 on that side or all the feeds to
93:30 everything there's video if you're an
93:31 audio audio audio if you're in video
93:33 there's the locked Facebook group link
93:37 and your options for video or YouTube
93:39 and Vimeo I sure hope the adopt me stays
93:42 in business cuz I have now baked it into
93:45 all my outros your podcast options are
93:50 iTunes Google Play and if you have a
93:54 podcast reader on your mobile phone just
93:57 go to the website click on the RSS feed
94:00 and it will connect your phone to the
94:03 podcast and you'll be good to go I want
94:07 to thank all of you guys for joining the
94:08 channel it's a privilege to have you on
94:10 board conversations are still wonderful
94:12 we do not have any disruptors causing us
94:16 any problems in fact the disruptors that
94:18 have posted a lot of bad stuff their
94:21 accounts have been shut down or they
94:23 shut down their accounts and so a lot of
94:26 their kind of frivolous comments that
94:30 make no points and just kind of blather
94:33 negativity or gone to which is kind of
94:36 interesting a couple more still out
94:38 there but they haven't commented in a
94:40 really long time so it's good anyway
94:43 thank you for joining take care of
94:45 yourself and someone else and I'll see
94:47 in the next deep thoughts over now
