00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this rather cold Friday
00:43 night I got the the equipment out here I
00:51 even have a little space heater see I've
00:54 learned my lesson that when I have time
00:56 I need to pound these episodes out
00:58 because invariably we'll get busy and
01:01 I'll lose a couple weeks from my
01:03 recording regiment and then we all
01:06 suffer don't we
01:08 I'm joking newcomers tonight I want to
01:11 talk about something that's I'm gonna
01:15 keep it as informal as possible by
01:19 informal I'm not going to jump in to a
01:21 bunch of chemical names and biology
01:28 neurology terminology it's all starting
01:33 to come together because I've been
01:36 actually talking to some of the
01:38 listeners and I've noticed that when I
01:42 well the report is is that when I'm more
01:45 metaphorical and abstract about
01:46 scientific explanations that people get
01:50 it more and they get more out of it and
01:52 so this is what we're gonna do with this
01:54 episode called the electric mind now for
01:59 some of you you're gonna know what ton
02:01 of this stuff but I think having had
02:06 many lunch and dinner with individuals
02:09 with even degrees in this they they
02:14 memorized and repeated a bunch of stuff
02:16 their life in their lifetime but when I
02:19 started to show the epigenetic full
02:22 lifecycle of how electricity is
02:25 metabolized by our mind on a daily basis
02:28 to create this experience that we have I
02:30 got a lot of oohs and ahhs like oh yeah
02:33 I never really thought about that before
02:34 and yet these folks had spent in some
02:37 cases more than a decade teaching this
02:42 sort of stuff right and it all has to do
02:46 with
02:47 opening up your mind and the paradigm of
02:49 what we are as individuals as human
02:52 bodies right this will largely stay a
02:56 biological conversation and not a
02:58 spiritual conversation but who knows
03:01 where I might go right the reason for
03:03 making this episode is that I have found
03:06 personally a lot of mechanisms to manage
03:11 my life and to understand my body better
03:14 by understanding that what I am is in
03:18 part again the biological part of me now
03:23 the atomic part necessarily but we're
03:24 going to touch on a bit of that as well
03:27 the where the summation of how
03:30 electricity is metabolized by the body
03:33 we have biological sensors we have
03:36 chemicals we have all types of
03:39 constructs that carry the nervous system
03:41 in our body we know that our mind is
03:43 very electrical and I think it's
03:47 interesting that we have this sort of
03:49 complicity complicity right yeah with
03:53 the unknown I'm gonna give you a little
03:56 bit of a start off analogy which I am
03:58 borrowing from Robert Llewellyn who
04:00 borrowed it from a woman who writes a
04:02 bunch of books whose name completely
04:04 escapes me I saw her once in a slide as
04:08 part of a Llewelyn project I was working
04:09 on I don't know she's British I don't
04:12 know she's English but a female
04:17 psychologists or psychiatrists one of
04:19 the two I think she's a degreed
04:22 individual but she realized something
04:25 that I don't know if she claimed to be
04:26 the originator of the concept but I
04:28 think it's very powerful that men and
04:31 women are different and on a conceptual
04:34 level and this is gonna be one of these
04:37 things where men aren't as empowered as
04:40 women to deal with the unknown simply
04:44 because of our biology the difference in
04:46 our biology and the way the analogy goes
04:48 is very simple what a man looks down at
04:51 his private parts they are external to
04:54 his body there's nothing hidden and so a
04:58 man depending on how much time he's got
05:00 can examine himself and understand his
05:03 pieces and parts down there okay a woman
05:07 looks down and does not see the lion's
05:11 share of her reproductive organs why
05:15 because they're inside and when a woman
05:19 deals with that she is forced to accept
05:24 the unknown now this is not necessarily
05:28 directly related to what we're gonna
05:30 talk about today but it's interesting
05:33 how many times have you been told as a
05:36 child that you have a nervous system and
05:40 you know when I was a kid the word
05:42 nervous was always used to mean you're
05:43 you know having a moment but a nervous
05:46 system is a you know an electrical
05:48 conduit of meridians that run all the
05:50 way down your body right you see the the
05:53 old anatomy books back in the day the
05:55 old world encyclopedias where they had a
05:56 bunch of clear overlays and you could
05:58 simply build the body from the nervous
06:02 system up and you'd apply bones usually
06:04 I think after that and one of the clear
06:06 overlays but help you understand how
06:10 your mind works through the spine of
06:13 your body through the nervous system
06:15 which has a bunch of points where the
06:18 nervous system leaves the brain I think
06:21 it's not all the way through the spine
06:22 but most of it goes through the spine
06:24 and it reaches out to every part of the
06:26 body so that when you touch something
06:28 you can feel it because that speed of
06:33 light transmission of your sensor and
06:38 your finger getting the feedback and
06:41 sending up this signal to your brain
06:43 allows you to create an image in your
06:46 mind now it's fascinating about this for
06:49 any of you played video games or work in
06:51 3d software you understand that when you
06:54 launched this 3d game engine technology
06:58 is the you know most people start with
06:59 like something that's already in the
07:01 system but at some point you're you're
07:03 building assets from nothing you're
07:05 inside of a 3d application and you're
07:06 building perhaps a human perhaps sword
07:09 perhaps a car and then you bring it into
07:12 the game engine which then you add
07:14 lesion onto it and a bunch of other
07:15 stuff perhaps you're doing animations
07:17 algorithmically or what-have-you but you
07:19 know that you're building a 3d construct
07:21 inside of a virtual piece of software it
07:24 doesn't really exist note so maybe your
07:26 3d print the thing right the work comes
07:29 out as a new car that someone is
07:31 building or a plane or a jet or a rocket
07:33 or whatever right but I was talking to
07:36 my buddy Dave they keeping the cigar
07:38 expert of the world and he had this is
07:43 really like I credit this whole episode
07:45 to him sparking my brain but it was also
07:49 some other recent conversations I have
07:51 in conversations I've had over the last
07:52 couple decades with people that really
07:53 kind of got me going you know this is
07:56 something we all deal with but again we
07:57 don't talk about it and it will be very
08:00 powerful I think for each one of us to
08:04 sort of advance our sensory system our
08:09 understanding of our bodies using this
08:11 map technology this electrical map
08:14 technology but the big debate was how a
08:19 flavor is created because when you smoke
08:22 a cigar for instance doesn't have to be
08:24 a cigar you say that you have a flavor
08:26 and what scientists have figure figured
08:30 out and I think very astutely you know
08:32 I'm very skeptical of anything that's
08:34 coming out of any scientific community
08:36 and I'm probably an [ __ ] in that way
08:38 in that way and then I'm always
08:40 questioning immediately I don't say it
08:42 out loud but someone's telling me
08:44 something scientific well did you hear
08:45 what they figured out I'm just like
08:46 skeptic mode go ahead but they said that
08:50 a flavor is the combination of taste and
08:52 aroma together and the taste is almost
08:58 entirely short-circuited when aroma has
09:01 been destroyed you hold your nose and
09:05 you can you take member the castor-oil
09:07 thing from the little rascals kids with
09:11 all their noses and drink the Castro oil
09:12 right it probably should be drinking
09:15 castor oil at some point but when you're
09:18 not holding your nose the taste from
09:20 your tongue and the aroma from your nose
09:22 creates this combination electrical
09:25 pattern in your mind which is known as
09:26 flavor
09:28 it's distinctly different when you smoke
09:30 a cigar you definitely have a bunch of
09:32 flavors on your tongue when you retch or
09:35 hell through your nose you get a bunch
09:36 of flavors up in your nose and then
09:38 together there's this connection that is
09:44 the flavor now the interesting thing is
09:48 my friend did a bunch of biology
09:50 research on the tongue because he just
09:53 wants to understand why we're tasting
09:55 all these different variations from
09:57 different cigars from Cubans to New
09:58 Worlds the old Cubans the recent Cubans
10:00 all that good stuff and what they have
10:02 figured out is that even though we have
10:04 been told our entire life's that our
10:06 tongues have various regions of taste
10:07 you know bitters I think are on the
10:09 outside edge and sweets are in a
10:11 different place and salts and all this
10:12 different stuff that save the very back
10:18 tastebuds of those big ones on the back
10:20 of your tongue back there that all of
10:26 the tastebuds in our tongue when they do
10:28 a cross-section of them under a
10:30 microscope they have the cluster the
10:33 same identical cluster of taste tasting
10:36 bud mechanisms okay that all of the
10:40 regions have and so they're they're now
10:42 saying that that that science quote
10:46 unquote that was created around the
10:47 tongue is completely bunk that the
10:49 entire tongue can taste everything all
10:51 the time now there's a little bit of
10:55 science to that as well which has
10:57 nothing to do with regions of the tongue
11:00 but for survival reasons the brain
11:02 actually has a pattern cancellation
11:05 mechanism whereby smells and tastes and
11:09 probably even well definitely a rumpus
11:11 above flavors they do cancel out once
11:15 you're prolonged and overexposure of it
11:17 we all know that when you take drugs
11:19 there's a point where you have to take a
11:21 ton more drugs to get the same effect as
11:23 a tiny bit of drugs at the very
11:24 beginning because your brain starts
11:25 canceling out the electrical pattern
11:28 that is created inside your mind
11:30 right this all will become hopefully
11:33 very interesting to you I should say
11:36 useful now imagine you built a computer
11:40 that you want to be well let's just say
11:42 a robot you built a robot you give it a
11:44 bunch of sensors
11:46 it's obviously as electricity going down
11:48 to the sensors you have input sensors
11:51 and you might even have control
11:54 mechanisms that make the robots arms
11:56 move you're trying to create a virtual
11:58 human some sort of replicant from the
12:00 tyro corporation and so you're going to
12:03 have to attempt to give the robot
12:06 everything that you know that you have
12:07 and that's a nice little metaphor in
12:10 your brain to realize what we're trying
12:13 to talk about each one of the components
12:16 would probably be built by a separate
12:17 department in terms of the unique five
12:19 senses that we believe that we have
12:21 right and so you would have a sort of a
12:27 hearing sensor maybe it's a sonar system
12:29 or what have you you have some
12:31 microphone sensor that's going to take
12:33 in hearing then you're going to have
12:35 sight sensors which could be all kinds
12:38 of different sensors they could be
12:39 receptacle sensors like the rods and
12:41 cones and our ice early ccd input device
12:45 and most digital cameras you could have
12:49 as far as touch anything that is
12:52 displacing a circuit a little bit of
12:56 electricity that goes across the wire
12:58 across the surface once you touch
13:00 something it's going to interrupt the
13:02 conductivity of that little pad that you
13:04 might put down in a fingertip and it's
13:06 going to report hey I think we're
13:08 touching something because we're losing
13:09 signal down by the finger all right you
13:14 might put humidification sensors you
13:16 might put heat sensors all over the body
13:19 maybe it's an epidermis material that we
13:21 create and with that we're starting to
13:24 give this virtual human all of its
13:28 capabilities to take in data from
13:30 wherever you put it if it's a skin it's
13:33 all over there's some nano fabric that
13:35 has all this all these little micro
13:36 sensors in it well then you put a match
13:39 next to the robot shoulder and it's
13:42 going to whoa my brain my little AI
13:44 robot brain says get away from heat
13:47 because it's a damaging reaction that
13:50 we're supposed to get away from it
13:51 damages me and I would have to repair
13:54 if the robot wasn't biological we'd have
13:56 to mechanically repair the outside skin
14:00 let me give you a practical example
14:02 really quick so you don't lose me or I
14:05 don't lose you excuse me early in this
14:07 episode I told you guys that prepping
14:10 pretty much from the age of nine up I
14:13 have found going to sleep extremely
14:16 difficult because as soon as I lay down
14:17 and stop controlling my body actively
14:21 then my brain is so elated okay that it
14:25 just plugs into the universe and what I
14:28 would now term as my research in philip
14:30 k dick has given me a name for the river
14:35 of knowledge I essentially see story my
14:40 own little fictitious stories that have
14:42 nothing to do with anything specific I
14:44 see scenes in films I've been writing
14:46 for years but at one point I can't
14:50 remember what it was I don't even know
14:52 what year this started for me but I put
14:55 an earplug in one night I think maybe
14:57 because some noise or something and all
14:59 of a sudden I slept like a baby
15:01 relatively speaking I'm not gonna admit
15:05 when I wet myself or not but what I
15:08 figured out because it went on you know
15:11 whatever whatever a cute event made me
15:14 put the ear plug in my ear obviously
15:15 didn't persist over time but I realized
15:17 when I didn't wear it I didn't sleep
15:19 very well and then when I did where I
15:21 was sleeping really what was going to
15:22 bed that transition from the Twilight
15:24 Zone into deep sleep / dream world right
15:30 what I realized was that putting the ear
15:33 plug in the ear that is up you can still
15:36 hear in the room but you just don't hear
15:38 a lot of like really high-pitched noises
15:40 you'll definitely fear feel the thuds in
15:44 the room you know anyone walking down
15:46 the hallway or someone closing a door or
15:48 whatever so you're not going to be at
15:49 any massive state of peril just because
15:52 you're gonna hear plug-in but what I was
15:55 doing was cutting off a tremendous
15:56 amount of noise that was going into my
15:58 head a lot of the ambient noise at night
16:01 now when I mountain a cabin esc'
16:04 kind of world I met my uncles
16:06 branch or something like that it's not
16:08 as imperative that I have these but even
16:11 just the old-fashioned noise of a wind
16:14 or someone rolling over in a bed in the
16:17 room next to you or something like that
16:18 so I'm going the restroom at night or
16:20 whatever TV still going you're going to
16:22 bed early because you've been flying all
16:23 day I can't get to bed if it's dead
16:26 silent but I was cutting out a bunch of
16:29 electricity because that's how it works
16:33 sound waves an actual physical
16:36 concussion to the hammer inside my ear
16:38 is then translated into electricity
16:42 which isn't goes into the centers in my
16:44 brain that say hi we're hearing
16:46 something process that man and so what I
16:52 was doing was translating that I think
16:56 extra energy that my brain didn't need
16:59 to create sound there's like it's like
17:02 the circuit was being overloaded I think
17:06 I've said you told you guys before I've
17:08 got so far at my age just bionic hearing
17:12 I mean it's just crazy what I can hear
17:15 and it's not tinnitus I'm getting
17:17 ringing in my ears I used to get ringing
17:19 them when I was a kid sometimes in bed
17:21 and I don't get that anymore but I can
17:25 hear really really well and so my my
17:28 interpretation is that the Hearing
17:29 Centers of my mind and or at least the
17:31 equipment that's processing hearing is
17:32 so efficient that it's basically sending
17:36 in too much it's converting too much
17:38 calorie energy into electricity to
17:41 process sound thus creating an overflow
17:42 in the circuit which goes off to my
17:44 imagination
17:45 so by blocking it within your plug and
17:48 yes I do when I roll over I've got a
17:51 I've just my hand is completely both of
17:53 them have completely learned how to to
17:56 comfortably blow it out of my ear I use
17:57 the really soft ones not the the plastic
18:01 ones that have the little ribs on them
18:03 as the kind you get at the airport I
18:04 would say never put those in your ear
18:07 because when you pull them out there's
18:09 way too much suction on the internals of
18:12 your ear I think those I think that
18:13 [ __ ] company should be banned from
18:15 making those so get the really soft ones
18:18 they look like little
18:19 pieces of candy looks like that orange
18:22 popcorn or the orange peanuts we used to
18:24 eat right but you squeeze it you pull it
18:27 out you roll over you stick it in it's
18:28 just a little ritual no big deal
18:32 but when that started working for me it
18:35 started my mind thinking about how all
18:37 electricity in the body is being
18:38 metabolized and then later on I bump
18:40 into Bruce Lipton talking about
18:42 epigenetics which is essentially the
18:44 study of how the body metabolizes
18:47 electricity via the environment via your
18:52 own thoughts with your neural peptides
18:56 there's a fancy word we'll use once and
18:59 it got so interesting that when I lay in
19:01 bed at night one of my rules is if I
19:06 have like a weird configuration of the
19:09 sheet you know sometimes you get in your
19:11 bed after you freshly make it it's all
19:13 tight and boy you sleep like a no
19:15 problem right it's just beautiful but
19:17 then you sleep in your bed for a few
19:18 days and the and the bed sheet the one
19:21 that your the mattress sheet starts to
19:23 loosen up a little bit it's been laying
19:24 in even stretching the firebirds it
19:26 starts coming undone from the bottom of
19:27 the mattress or whatever and you get
19:29 these rolls in the sheets and when you
19:33 lay in that sometimes it feels like you
19:35 got you know you know a ballpoint pen in
19:37 there with you and you're like I don't
19:38 know it's just the sheet underneath
19:39 means all folded up so I'll reach down
19:41 and stretch it out in my hand and all
19:43 sudden smooth as glass
19:44 but anytime there's something touching
19:47 me that is acutely reporting to my mind
19:50 this is here this is here this is here
19:51 this is here I have to straighten that
19:53 out after move my leg or something if I
19:55 sleep next to someone and spoon someone
19:57 all the configurations of the human body
19:59 are usually not a comfortable
20:02 configuration until everything is sort
20:04 of smooth right if your girlfriends or
20:07 boyfriends like jabbing you with the
20:08 toenail they have no idea it's happening
20:10 but that's an acute rapport a pressure
20:13 on your body that may result in a cut or
20:15 contusions some type of bruising or
20:18 something like that because it's it's
20:20 really pushing on your capillaries and
20:21 breaking things and you're in your
20:23 epidermis right your skin so you
20:27 typically adjust in so you get that
20:28 right and then most of us roll over 50
20:31 minutes later where's Ben
20:33 the rest of the night sort of with
20:34 somebody but sort of solo at the same
20:36 time right but the flavor thing got me
20:39 thinking why is it when you plug your
20:42 nose you can't taste anything and thus
20:44 by cutting off both aroma and taste you
20:47 have no flavor and without knowing how
20:51 all of the electricity and from your
20:55 nervous system is wired in your head
20:58 here's what's fun when you're
21:00 intelligent and not just smart the
21:03 deduction that we can make is that your
21:06 palate in your mouth is wired in such a
21:12 way that it has a dependent circuit with
21:15 a nose meaning it probably is wired to
21:18 the nose somehow even if it goes back up
21:20 into your brain and you guys who were
21:22 doctors and neurologists please chime in
21:25 and just straighten this out for us
21:28 there has to be a logic gate somewhere
21:31 inside of our mind where taste attaches
21:35 to aroma and only when the two are open
21:39 do you get the three-dimensional
21:43 combined impression in the mind and the
21:45 electrical mind that you have this other
21:47 concept that gives form call flavor
21:51 right I know that's a very trivial thing
21:54 but it's something we do every single
21:56 day and you can practice with it if you
21:58 know right next time you eat lunch or
22:00 dinner or whatever take a little snack
22:01 or anything you can play with this and
22:04 realize oh my god there's like a whole
22:06 logic system to the way my my body's put
22:08 together now that's not a huge profound
22:10 statement but start expanding every part
22:14 of your body every part of your intake
22:17 which we'll get to like healing rituals
22:21 to make up any one state of being right
22:25 we as human beings believe in time
22:28 because we create state recorders right
22:31 what state am I in now what state am I
22:33 now it stayed in my now what state a
22:34 minute and we folded away into this big
22:37 hard drive in the universe and it tells
22:40 us that we were smaller we were older
22:44 I'm sorry we were younger excuse me
22:46 you were feeling older one day now with
22:49 epigenetics for those of you who've
22:51 never heard that statement before what
22:54 that is is the original how do I say
22:58 this it was the original evolution and
23:02 it's not Darwinism okay it's not we come
23:06 from monkeys sort of evolution this is
23:08 an evolution that is sort of godly I
23:12 would say it is the fact that you are
23:15 here now and that you communicate with
23:20 your body through your thoughts we know
23:23 this for a fact right move your toe okay
23:25 well you made the decision in your mind
23:27 to move your toe and think about it if
23:29 you moved your big toe you're moving the
23:32 furthest extremity from your brain
23:34 pretty wild right for anyone who's lost
23:37 a limb they talk about phantom pain and
23:40 they also talk about the phantom limb
23:42 meaning their brain is still recording
23:45 sort of a sort of a looped video camera
23:50 of what was there okay for thee of
23:52 you've seen Ocean's eleven are those
23:54 those surveillance cameras that are
23:56 tapped into in movies where the big
23:58 thing is to take a you know I don't know
24:01 five seconds of recording when no one's
24:02 walking down the hallway and then they
24:04 loop it over and over and over again
24:06 such that the person is walking down the
24:08 hallway the security guard if they
24:10 happened to glance over at the monitor
24:12 they don't see any movement and
24:13 therefore they can rob the casino right
24:16 well if your brain has a concept of time
24:19 of state management you know I'm not on
24:22 fire I'm on fire I'm not on fire boom
24:25 that was three states of being
24:28 then it's saying you have a leg you have
24:30 a leg you have a leg even though you may
24:32 not have a leg right but all it can do
24:35 is run back the tape on what it felt
24:40 like when you gave your limb a command
24:43 to do something or whether it was
24:45 resting or something like that now one
24:46 thing I don't know about phantom pain I
24:48 don't have any friends that have any
24:51 missing limbs that at least were recent
24:54 losses
24:56 of whether or not when you command a
24:58 missing limb to move whether or not you
25:00 actually feel like it's moving but it's
25:03 not there so think about it though if
25:05 you were say even 10 years old you've
25:08 got 10 years of moving that lemon
25:10 feeling like what it would feel like at
25:12 various places so you might have a
25:15 feeling of your leg in bed and you have
25:17 those memories and you can just roll
25:18 back the tape and you're playing a back
25:20 up here in the brain with an electrical
25:22 tape playing back or an mp3 for you
25:26 young folks but it's not really there
25:29 it's physically not there but because
25:32 your entire state of mental biological
25:37 identity is captured in the chemicals in
25:39 your brain it is right I believe we also
25:42 have the symbiotic soul but that's a
25:44 whole another set of feelings and
25:47 emotions which we're going to leave out
25:49 of this particular video but a French
25:53 guy who worked for Napoleone as I've
25:57 read it he came into power or he came
25:59 into his authority / position from
26:02 poverty in about 1790
26:04 and he was an utter genius and Napoleon
26:07 was a genius and calculus so he knew how
26:10 to he was in a the pulling was an any
26:12 player that hired other a players a
26:14 Steve job would say but this guy
26:16 invented something that I don't know
26:18 what the French term was was if it was
26:20 epigenetics or what-have-you but what he
26:23 realized was that the human body reacts
26:28 to touch you know way down here in the
26:31 fingers right got a bunch of shadows
26:33 tonight but then it relays back up into
26:35 the brain it's not a big epiphany for
26:37 anyone but this guy started thinking how
26:40 how does that happen in 1790 they don't
26:42 have in my opinion I started my
26:45 knowledge I don't think they had any
26:46 nervous system encyclopedias to tell
26:49 them what was going on in fact if you
26:51 were Christian you weren't allowed to
26:52 look inside the human body yet right
26:54 people did it but they had to hide
26:57 bodies underneath their houses when they
26:59 were done right but again studying a
27:02 cadaver and asking it what it's like to
27:03 be alive it's a little tough right
27:07 but once this guy figured out that the
27:11 human body has an electrical system he
27:14 may not have even conceived of as being
27:16 electrical but it was a messaging system
27:19 let's just say my mind is telling my
27:21 foot to do something you don't typically
27:24 wake up and this is sort of a joke but
27:27 you don't wake up and you feel like
27:29 you're your whole brain and your
27:31 identities in your finger but you're
27:32 using these remote things called your
27:34 eyeballs to see the universe no we feel
27:37 like our consciousness is in side our
27:39 brain usually even further back then the
27:41 skull actually represents the space a
27:44 bit like a TARDIS if you will and so
27:48 through that just basic deduction you
27:50 realize there was messages going back
27:52 and forth so when he figured that out
27:57 he realized well I'm contributing to my
27:59 own movement I am authoring message
28:02 packets that are going all over my body
28:03 and that has to contribute to my overall
28:06 being what I actually turn out to be at
28:09 the end of the day now what he didn't
28:11 know was that there these peptides that
28:15 your brain creates with thought and a
28:17 peptide is sort of an instruction of how
28:19 to metabolize growth and so he also
28:25 realized that well some of us live up in
28:28 the ALF some of us live down in valleys
28:30 where it's warm a lot we know that
28:31 there's places like Egypt that are warm
28:33 all the time we know that some people
28:37 might have animals around them
28:39 constantly some people have loved ones
28:40 around them constantly
28:41 you can watch animals pick on each other
28:43 right little monkeys cleaning each other
28:45 off right so with Jaylin work figured
28:48 out was that there's a contribution from
28:50 the environment to the human body which
28:54 must all it must also contribute to our
28:56 overall being in the end of the day
28:59 again we when I was a young kid and I
29:03 didn't understand the pigment and skin I
29:06 asked my mom I was like why why are
29:08 people dark and why are some people
29:10 white like why am i see-through mom and
29:14 her explanation was fairly apt she said
29:17 look you know when people live in Africa
29:19 and very hot environments
29:21 the Sun is very brutal on the body and
29:23 this denser darker pigment creates a
29:27 thicker skin which is capable of a
29:29 during massive heating exposure right
29:32 and then when you don't have a lot of
29:35 that exposure you get less pigment in
29:38 your skin because you don't need it and
29:40 use other things like furs and
29:42 what-have-you to keep warm now it would
29:44 seem that almost the thicker skin would
29:48 be more apt to in a person who's in a
29:50 colder environment and thinner skin and
29:52 an app an environment that's darker but
29:55 because it's air sorry that's hotter but
29:57 because the Sun is such a a I was gonna
30:02 say the word brutal but that's a little
30:03 bit of a mischaracterization but since
30:05 the Sun is definitely cooking our body
30:08 just a little bit through friction I
30:11 think that is why we have folks with
30:14 thicker skin and folks with thinner skin
30:15 right now as I've said just a button up
30:19 Darwin for a split second when the
30:21 Battle of Waterloo was won by the
30:24 British and they started to pillage
30:25 French technology you had this
30:29 aristocratic sort of I don't know what
30:34 she would call this guy darlin was an
30:37 aristocratic child running around with
30:38 his daddy's money in this boat called
30:40 the Beagle he's sort of sensed evolution
30:42 and his mind that things actually change
30:44 over time that you know as things
30:46 regenerate regenerate that they change
30:49 the interesting thing that is a lot of a
30:52 lot of plant life is still the same and
30:55 fossilized plants right so a fern looks
30:58 pretty much the same as it does right
30:59 now so in terms of its overall change
31:03 there's a lot of problems with this
31:05 theory of course the idea that man came
31:08 from ape is completely abolished by the
31:10 missing link which is you know over a
31:14 hundred million years of you know
31:16 according to the carbon dating
31:17 technology where we're just missing any
31:21 evolution from a hominid to Homo Sapien
31:23 and we get off into that but that's
31:25 that's definitely a big problem with his
31:28 deal so he essentially settled for the
31:30 most mundane explanation which was
31:33 survival of the fittest
31:35 right big [ __ ] surprise their biggest
31:38 animal is king of the jungle biggest
31:41 human being gets to tell the other human
31:43 beings what to do until we realize how
31:45 to form into little militias and knock
31:50 the big guy out and then we're all
31:51 whatever five foot five at one point
31:53 we're all like yeah that's cool mainly
31:55 okay I'll leave you alone you leave me
31:56 alone that's good all right but now now
32:01 that we've sort of established a bunch
32:02 of examples where I think most of us can
32:04 agree that our bodies behave at least an
32:10 average mean as I've described it what
32:13 benefits do we have as human beings
32:16 because we do have control over these
32:17 things
32:19 well in the movie we'll call what the
32:21 bleep do we know that is exactly the
32:23 name of course they couldn't use the
32:24 f-bomb I guess they could have said hell
32:27 I guess they went into the neural
32:32 peptide and the neural peptide is a very
32:33 amazing thing that they this is movies
32:37 packed with phd's there's one little a
32:40 little bizarre you know wild card a
32:43 woman who's a channeler is in the movie
32:45 I really wish they left her out even
32:47 though she's very smart and she
32:48 contributed a lot to the foam you just
32:51 don't need a psychic in there right but
32:54 the way the story goes is that if you
32:55 can confidently manufacture your
32:58 peptides your neural peptides into a
33:01 vision of yourself that you want to be
33:03 and again most of us do this through
33:07 automatic training because we have been
33:10 conditioned by our family in our
33:12 environment on a sociological level
33:14 which turns into a psychological image
33:19 of ourselves we tend to become and
33:22 remain who we perceive ourselves to be
33:26 again when I went back to my high school
33:28 reunion a couple years ago everyone who
33:31 sat around the room talking about how
33:34 old they are and they love those little
33:36 catchphrases where I'm getting old
33:39 everyone's getting old they just love
33:40 those phrases they looked 10 years older
33:43 than me me I'm like well why would I
33:47 want to change I like to buy look this
33:49 is where I look and sure agents gonna
33:53 happen but it's gonna have to force its
33:55 way into my life right which is why I
33:57 look a little younger than I that I am
33:58 an age right well my biggest problems in
34:01 life is people talking to me who are
34:04 younger than me patronizing me about the
34:08 era they grew up in and I wouldn't know
34:10 anything about that
34:11 because I'm so much younger than they
34:12 are I got a really good friend he's 15
34:15 years younger than me
34:16 and we used to go bar hopping together
34:20 and his biggest thing was to be talking
34:22 to two young girls he's about he was
34:24 about 30 at the time I think that's
34:25 about 45 and his big thing was you
34:28 talking to two young girls who
34:29 instinctively know just by little
34:33 microscopic things and your facial
34:36 features or whatever your hair or
34:37 whatever how old you are and he'd say
34:40 okay girls first which one of us is
34:44 younger and they pointed me and then
34:46 he'd say okay how much younger what how
34:48 old am i old is he I get 28 he'd get 32
34:52 and he was only 30 and I was 45 right
34:55 because I control my mind had control
34:58 Who I am right now you also know folks
35:02 that are they're the folks that gets
35:06 sick all the time and they tell you that
35:08 they get sick all the time
35:10 they're almost sort of addicted to
35:12 telling you how sick they are they're
35:14 sort of looking forward to the next
35:15 thing that will make them have a little
35:17 bit of dialogue with someone or a little
35:19 bit of attention from someone because
35:21 they're sick some people believe that
35:24 they will always be heavy overweight and
35:28 so they always are until they make that
35:30 change and what's interesting about
35:32 finding someone who has greatly improved
35:34 their health and it doesn't only have to
35:36 be weight loss or anything they decided
35:39 to be healthy they got tired of the game
35:42 of being sick and all of a sudden got
35:44 better it's interesting you wonder why I
35:47 want your brain to be as strong as it is
35:49 right now I want you to be good as well
35:53 right and want you to practice
35:54 common-law don't hurt anyone else cause
35:57 no harm right do no harm but I want you
36:02 to be in control of your mind because I
36:04 know that when you're encrypted control
36:05 of your brain you tend to be come the
36:08 person that you want to be it it we know
36:12 from manifest destiny that there's a
36:14 spiritual thing going on
36:16 that we actually control our reality you
36:19 can go see my episodes and existential
36:20 ism mind over matter I think I have one
36:24 called manifest destiny or something
36:26 like that on there look at this
36:27 self-improvement playlist on YouTube or
36:30 search on the deep thoughts we do com
36:32 search field but I want to be in a
36:35 planet with a bunch of healthy happy
36:37 people right it does not mean you need
36:40 to be magazine thin okay a lot of people
36:44 are built to be bigger it's just the
36:46 truth I want you to be happy right one
36:50 of the big criticisms that well it's
36:54 with this way when I lived in the San
36:55 Francisco Bay Area they are almost in a
36:59 state of complete [ __ ] psychosis
37:01 about Southern California they take a
37:03 [ __ ] on Southern California and almost
37:05 every other phrase that comes out of
37:06 their mouth it's unbelievable and what's
37:11 really sad about that is that when I
37:12 lived there for 12 years solid I never
37:15 met more unhappy people in my life
37:17 people have no reason to be unhappy now
37:20 I met a lot of happy people as well of
37:22 course right but just wow just unhappy
37:25 always attacking each other never really
37:29 contributing to anyone else's success
37:30 never making an introduction that they
37:33 could make to get you higher than they
37:35 are in society it was all about keep you
37:37 down they go up but no one goes up
37:40 because no one's helping each other at
37:41 all but I started in Southern California
37:44 and so I figured out when I lived down
37:46 here it was like the network Haven of
37:49 the world I think I told the story a
37:51 long time ago this is all gonna feed
37:52 back into your perception of your
37:54 reality such that you can control it in
37:56 an electrical way okay and I moved from
37:59 a really nice little town in the Midwest
38:01 to Southern California and when I told
38:04 people what I wanted to do
38:07 they didn't flinch they were like oh
38:10 that's cool man well great I'll hire you
38:12 to do that into me they get jobs doing
38:14 them but when I said I want to do
38:15 something outrageous like write film
38:17 I'm 1819 years old nobody said hey you
38:21 know you need to go get a degree in that
38:23 you need to do this and that now they
38:24 were like well we have a family at the
38:25 church that writes screenplays super
38:28 famous ones and we'll just hook you up
38:30 with them and they'll mentor you up boom
38:33 you say that stuff for the Bay Area it's
38:35 like oh good luck good luck with that
38:38 here's the thing what if you grew up in
38:41 Southern California where you are
38:44 constantly attached to folks through
38:46 networking someone knows someone knows
38:48 somebody and anything you want to do now
38:51 you're gonna have to come up with the
38:52 talent there's nothing you're gonna be
38:53 able to do to get want something and not
38:55 get skillful in it right you want to be
38:57 a director but you won't study film
38:58 right yeah that's never gonna work but
39:01 if you're willing to put in the time
39:02 either self-educated or go get the
39:04 education or go apprentice somebody
39:06 they'll get you to the right people
39:08 and so every day that you wake up you're
39:10 happy every day that you wake up it is
39:13 well I want to be fit I want to look
39:16 good and so your body starts going well
39:19 this is the way it works I mean
39:20 everything that we set our mind to we
39:22 can get because there's not only your
39:24 participation in your life but as you
39:26 vocalize it out to the outside world
39:27 people will help you get what you need
39:30 again you got to bring the skill I
39:31 always got to say that ten times right
39:34 but if you grew up in a world like the
39:36 Bay Area and I'm sorry folks in the Bay
39:37 Area but this is my experience up there
39:39 and I've had it reaffirmed in the last
39:42 12 months let me tell you but if you're
39:47 always trying to push to be something
39:49 that you are and no one's listening it's
39:51 always crickets when you say what you
39:53 want to do or in my experience you know
39:56 I have been blessed to work for some of
39:58 the most amazing minds that are recorded
40:02 in history as being some of the most
40:04 amazing minds in particular areas and
40:06 they picked me to be in their group and
40:08 so I've been validated by these
40:09 individuals and I'm only more powerful
40:11 today than I was back in the day when
40:12 these people liked me in their circle
40:15 and so I get into a situation where my
40:18 skill sets are exactly what this
40:20 group of people need and I say okay you
40:24 know just real quick I've done this
40:25 before
40:26 I work for these individuals so just two
40:29 got to give you some qualifications you
40:31 know I don't like Tooting my own horn
40:32 but you need to hear what I can do so
40:34 you can trust me with these tasks oh man
40:38 crickets crickets they don't want you to
40:41 succeed around them they don't want you
40:42 to top them because for everything in
40:44 their world as a competition they're
40:46 afraid of losing their job
40:47 if you blow them away they're not
40:49 looking at the bigger picture which
40:51 might be the company you're trying to
40:52 build it's very very sad it's very very
40:55 sad so now think about the idea that we
40:59 actually have things that we feel
41:02 electrically they don't have any names
41:05 they're not really taught to us in
41:07 school have you ever met like a sleazy
41:10 salesman the sleazy salesman is in the
41:14 business of selling you something that
41:15 you don't need and you don't find out
41:18 until you buy it because at the time
41:20 they were telling you this this sort of
41:24 they're projecting a vision of you with
41:25 this object you with this service or
41:27 this thing and your life's gonna be so
41:29 much better if you part with your
41:30 hard-earned money to get this service
41:33 now unbeknownst to you when you're young
41:36 you're actually recording all of that
41:39 input you're recording the sound of
41:41 their voice the smell of their cologne
41:43 or perfume sort of the expressions on
41:46 their face right and so the next time
41:50 you bump into someone that sounds and
41:51 smells and acts like this other person
41:54 you automatically are distrustful and
41:56 yeah I don't know about that guy about
41:58 that girl so it seems like a sleaze ball
42:00 to me you're doing that based on the
42:02 history of your previous experience and
42:05 usually unfortunately a negative one
42:07 right as you get a little bit older
42:09 you'll you'll realize that your game is
42:14 above theirs and you can start trying to
42:16 manipulate them back and you know okay
42:18 I'm going to position I can't get rid of
42:19 this person out of my life because maybe
42:21 they're part of the company I worked for
42:22 or whatever and you'll just start
42:25 playing chess like okay this guy thinks
42:28 he's always sitting in a [ __ ]
42:29 checkmate with me
42:31 hmm we're just gonna walk right around
42:33 those rules and Captain Kirk the
42:35 [ __ ] out of my life right and
42:38 unfortunately you do have to defend
42:39 yourself in one way or another with some
42:41 of these situations but your
42:44 neuropeptide is sitting there waiting
42:46 for your opinion about yourself that's
42:49 why it's really important that you pick
42:52 your friends you picked them very
42:53 carefully because if you have and of
42:57 course obviously your spouse's your
42:59 girlfriends boyfriends whatever your
43:00 partner's I should say it's very
43:03 important that you don't surround
43:04 yourself with a bunch of negative
43:05 negative nails
43:06 Nellie's right sort of your Debbie
43:08 downers if you were because it's one of
43:11 the best piece of advice is I was ever
43:12 told as a kid was that negative people
43:14 depressed people will always bring you
43:16 down they have no capacity to bring you
43:18 up unless you're a complete narcissist
43:20 who just likes to dominate other people
43:23 I know some of those folks as well now
43:26 as well I always want to remind you guys
43:28 we're talking about electrical
43:30 management of the brain there's a very
43:33 interesting correlation between a CPU a
43:36 central processing unit of a any
43:39 computer device and the neural density
43:42 of your brain how much how many synapse
43:44 you have in your brain to process any
43:47 incoming pattern of information it's
43:50 very very important why is someone
43:53 capable of being smarter than you very
43:56 quickly then and a lot of times we are
43:59 taught that it's a genetic sort of
44:01 blocker that through privilege you were
44:06 able to have family member after family
44:07 member
44:08 generations back get access to education
44:12 get access to opportunity and nurture
44:14 that nurture that to their point their
44:15 brain got denser and denser during their
44:18 lifetime okay and it you know when they
44:22 spawn okay you get a copy of where they
44:24 were when they spawn so let's just say
44:26 someone had an IQ of 110 at 20 years old
44:30 but they managed to crank it up to 140
44:32 by 30 years old but they had two
44:33 children one of them was at 20 and one
44:38 was it 30 so one gets the 110 math on
44:40 one gets the 140 mmm now through
44:42 conditions in environment and
44:44 opportunity it could be that the simpler
44:46 mind was more apt to digest society at
44:50 that point and so they end up being more
44:52 intelligent in the end and the 140 the
44:54 140 goes down to 85 and then 110 goes up
44:57 to 160 but in terms of the genetic
45:00 opportunity at the point of birth it
45:02 does go up and up and up which is why we
45:04 have to remove all the repression in the
45:06 world and increase education in every
45:09 sector in this planet you know where
45:11 education isn't strong we throw the
45:14 books in there and translate it into
45:15 their languages localize for their
45:17 culture and say hey if any of you are
45:20 interested in this right here but before
45:22 you you know walk away from this let me
45:25 give you the vision of your life if you
45:28 happen to know this information so they
45:29 can see the whole ecosystem of like well
45:31 why would I study aerospace and we say
45:34 well because you can get into this this
45:35 and this why would I study computer
45:36 programming because you could do that
45:38 that and then if that seems interesting
45:39 to you pick up the book and go for it
45:42 right with the same depth of a mind
45:45 works like this the more electricity you
45:48 put the wrists in them I've heard I've
45:50 said this dozens and dozens of times but
45:52 it's these core themes that I think are
45:54 very important for us to think about on
45:56 a daily basis I repeat them on purpose
45:57 just so that you know because I want you
46:00 to think about this I want you to pass
46:01 it on in conversation and I want you to
46:03 dispel myths that somehow the way that
46:05 you were born is exactly where you're
46:06 going to be for the rest of your life in
46:08 some cases it's true we don't have the
46:11 ability to grow limbs that are missing
46:12 when we're born that I know of and but
46:15 we can definitely increase the the cell
46:18 density of our brain cavities even
46:19 though they tell you at the age of 10
46:21 you don't get any more brain cells we
46:23 know that's not true because we've dyed
46:25 brains with black dye for people that
46:27 are terminally ill to find out where
46:30 tumors are and not only do we find out
46:32 the tumor that's all black but we also
46:34 find brand-new clean
46:36 cells in the brain that are newly
46:38 generated and they're in this
46:39 synaptically okay you're thinking family
46:42 in your brains right but a synapse will
46:45 get overwhelmed with electricity because
46:46 it is being used you're thinking you're
46:49 deducing I remember memorizing and
46:51 repeating well what are you doing
46:53 they're the most you're thinking is what
46:56 did Alec Alex Trebek say
46:58 you know it's not real thinking that is
47:00 just discerning input right but when you
47:04 think and you postulate and even if
47:07 you're wrong it doesn't matter you're
47:10 using your mind and that overwhelming
47:12 electrical stimulus into your setup will
47:14 kick off a reproduction process because
47:17 it will eventually say this is how
47:18 brilliantly designed we are we need more
47:21 synapse to think about this problem
47:23 because this person is chugging in
47:25 thought and think about it it took a
47:27 Swiss watch let's just go with the most
47:30 primitive Swiss watch that was ever made
47:31 I have no idea what year that was
47:33 let's say it was like 1650 and you buy
47:37 it and you keep it in your family for
47:38 200 years but you use it a lot well
47:41 let's just say for whatever reason the
47:44 internals of that watch thought it was
47:46 thinking and the more you demand on the
47:49 watch that it gives you microseconds and
47:51 nanoseconds you open the watch back up
47:53 200 years later and it's got more gears
47:56 sprockets and little thingies inside
47:58 there than it had at 18 or 1650 when you
48:00 first got into the family that is a
48:03 little metaphor a crude one at that of
48:05 how your brain works so use your brain
48:08 because you will simply improve it over
48:09 time reading books and that can
48:12 definitely help but the type of book you
48:14 read is very important is it inquisitive
48:16 is it a mystery book if you like fiction
48:18 it's something making you think about
48:20 facts in the book more than just
48:22 building an imagination of the story in
48:25 your head I'm sure that actually helps
48:27 as well but I know a lot of people that
48:29 devour books that probably aren't too
48:34 intelligent let's just put that way god
48:36 bless them do everything read your books
48:38 and get smart at the same time if you're
48:42 like me and you're totally addicted to
48:44 learning then this will just simply be
48:46 the result the byproduct of that process
48:49 right you can sit down in front of me
48:51 and you can have what you might think
48:53 them to be the most trivial career
48:55 anyone could ever have I mean you might
48:57 be a cashier a young 16 year old cashier
49:00 at some grocery store you could be a 50
49:02 year old cashier at a drug at some drug
49:05 store or whatever but because there's
49:07 something about you and your life and
49:09 what you do when you get to work and
49:10 what's the process
49:12 I'm fascinated right I'm sitting there
49:13 going well what about this well what
49:15 happens when that happens and I'm just
49:16 you'll feel like you're a rock star when
49:19 I'm talking to you because I want to
49:21 know every single thing about everything
49:23 and if I'm sitting there talking to you
49:25 why have we got time baby let's download
49:28 it into each other's brains right but
49:31 now think about it you know that there's
49:34 wireless technology now because of Tesla
49:37 because of Nikola Tesla and not Albert
49:39 Einstein
49:40 we have alternating current and we have
49:43 wireless technology among his many
49:48 inventions right and there's a bit of a
49:50 dispute about wireless technology
49:51 because another guy in Europe was doing
49:53 the same sort of research Tesla I
49:55 believe technically beat him but neither
49:58 one of them knew about each other until
50:00 afterwards and there were some
50:01 accusations but big deal it's a big
50:03 planet people are gonna have the same
50:04 ideas our guys Nikola Tesla in America
50:08 well how do you transmit electricity
50:10 across the room across a room not edie
50:14 across the room well we create a
50:17 frequency of energy and we beam it we
50:20 essentially create a verb reaction of
50:23 electricity across a room at a
50:26 particular frequency so that frequency
50:27 has a certain sine cosine you know wave
50:31 to it the higher the frequency the tide
50:34 of the wave most of us look at wireless
50:37 routers and we're like wow that's a new
50:38 invention yeah oh my god is so cool well
50:41 we know there's radar we know there's
50:42 been antennas transmitting radio for
50:45 almost a hundred years now I guess
50:47 probably a hundred years at least we
50:48 know that Telegraph technology exists -
50:53 you know back in the 1800s you know tell
50:55 you I've said it once before but let me
50:56 repeat it if you guys want to go on a
50:58 great rabbit hole of unbelievable
51:00 discovery of how electricity travels
51:03 down a wire go research the that we'll
51:07 just try to find documentaries about the
51:08 the telegraph system because as they
51:11 were trying to move electricity down
51:13 wires on poles such that we could have
51:15 one person take the Morse code and
51:17 repeat it and repeat it and once they
51:19 ran out of electricity it is one of the
51:21 most fascinating realms of technology
51:23 probably equivalent to
51:25 out of a silicon chip okay so just a
51:29 little footnote there for those of you
51:30 are interested but now wait a minute so
51:36 if you know where I'm going already if
51:39 we're an electrical being we manipulate
51:43 electricity that's how we exist how is
51:47 it that we have this inability to be
51:50 everything that electricity can do okay
51:53 well we have a finite amount of
51:54 electricity we run on a very very low
51:56 amperage of electricity in our bodies
51:58 fraction of a fraction of a fraction of
52:01 a percent produces pretty much
52:02 everything that we need okay now the
52:05 movie matrix did a brilliant job in
52:07 creating a fictional world where human
52:08 beings were being harvested for their
52:10 overall power okay but now can't human
52:17 beings communicate with each other well
52:20 once you suddenly overlay electricity
52:23 onto the human body and the human mind
52:25 again the beautiful thing about the mind
52:27 and its base principle of operating off
52:30 electricity then a bunch of stuff
52:33 becomes possible a bunch of mystery
52:35 start to appear right now again it's
52:38 hard not to talk about you know dreams
52:42 and potentially soul experiences where
52:46 electricity might be coming for some
52:48 really far out places prior money may
52:51 not even be considered electricity in
52:52 its purest form as is transmitting
52:55 information across the universe or
52:56 wherever the hell we are a message from
52:58 God or something it may be translated
53:00 back into something that we can
53:02 recognize again Tesla's whole goal was
53:04 to beam low frequency electricity into
53:07 your home and then Rhema Taba lies it
53:09 back up into exactly how much power of
53:11 your house needed
53:12 thus no wires in your home at all no
53:15 needed devices we're gonna have any
53:16 wires if Tesla wasn't hobbled before
53:19 death meaning having all of his
53:21 laboratories essentially exhausted for
53:24 funding and sort of just being inundated
53:31 with agendas that were pointless like he
53:34 was trying to create a weapon a super
53:36 weapon that would end all wars because
53:38 it would
53:39 the most formidable weapon on planet
53:40 earth and if you mess with him he would
53:43 just destroy your weapons and it was
53:45 essentially a directed-energy weapon
53:47 right yeah we'll probably do enough with
53:49 selling that stuff this year but now
53:52 it's been a couple seasons since I
53:53 mentioned this analogy but since we're
53:55 on the subject and we are now on point
53:57 okay one of the other things that has
54:00 been conducted and again some of my most
54:03 skeptical friends on planet earth that
54:05 believe nothing of than official stories
54:07 have told me the full litany of these
54:09 experiments and it's called the ten
54:12 monkey experiment as I understand it was
54:16 technically done with 100 monkeys but
54:17 I'm having a hard time finding the
54:18 actual incident in history and who did
54:21 it and who was responsible for but I've
54:23 had it told to me so many times it's and
54:26 I've experienced this personally and you
54:29 have to okay that I did to give it a lot
54:32 of credence but it's this idea that he
54:35 had a sort of an agro dome of
54:38 chimpanzees I believe and could be
54:43 rhesus too I think but I think it's been
54:45 conducted multiple times is the problem
54:47 the story changes just a little bit of
54:50 the anatomy and the pieces and parts
54:51 changed from when folks tell me but
54:53 again some of my most brilliant
54:55 scientific friends with big IQs and big
54:59 degrees have told me the story so for
55:02 them I just say okay you want to look up
55:04 my degree don't worry about it I'm
55:06 getting this from super duper sources
55:08 here and some of them are writers and
55:11 some of them are just folks that work in
55:13 science and neurology and have shared
55:16 this with me but anyway the way it goes
55:18 is that they had a hundred monkeys in a
55:20 facility and they pulled one monkey out
55:23 and they gave it they held it in
55:24 captivity and a non comfortable world
55:28 like a cagey kind of plant planet world
55:30 that it lived in and the policy was is
55:33 that as soon as the monkey figures out
55:35 what the human is doing because it has a
55:37 video of a human pushing the lever
55:40 pulling a thing to release a food pellet
55:43 they fed the monkey in the meantime but
55:45 this one little candy pellet they really
55:47 wanted right the monkey would have to
55:50 watch and then figure it out and it
55:52 like two weeks or so for the first
55:54 monkey to figure out how to do this then
55:56 they put the monkey back in the wild and
55:58 then let it sit for a week now they're
56:00 watching the monkey as well they're
56:02 watching it for two reasons they're
56:03 saying is it trying to show anybody this
56:05 thing or because it just figured it out
56:08 you didn't get a bunch of practice it
56:11 just figured it out once and boom you're
56:12 gone then it also they also watched what
56:16 monkeys did that monkey have no contact
56:18 with both what with whatsoever easy for
56:20 me to say well they purposely grabbed a
56:24 monkey that the first one did have any
56:25 contact with and put him back in this
56:27 cage I should technically say put him in
56:30 the cage for the first time oh he got it
56:34 done in about a week hmm interesting
56:37 a faster monkey well that's not proving
56:39 anything maybe that monkeys just got
56:40 more knowledge it's an older monkey or
56:43 whatever again it's brain pattern is
56:45 more suited for this kind of problem put
56:48 it back in the wild wait a week grab
56:51 another monkey that neither one of them
56:52 had any access to whoo it's getting at
56:55 about three days this went on and on
56:59 until every single monkey in the entire
57:00 place was pulled into the cage and
57:02 immediately just went tip tap tip thank
57:04 you
57:04 boom back out in the public with all the
57:07 other monkey's they realized that
57:10 without direct communication and again
57:12 there's no history of monkeys teaching
57:14 each other schematics of how things work
57:15 you do it in front of a monkey a monkey
57:18 see monkey do but the machine doesn't
57:19 exist in the wild so there's no way the
57:22 monkey can replicate this little
57:23 experiment in front of his buddies
57:25 having no contact well that just solves
57:27 the problem right okay they realized
57:32 that we communicate neurologically most
57:35 likely through electricity with each
57:38 other now exactly what the frequency
57:41 looks like between brains well as yet to
57:43 be determined
57:44 does one monkey give the entire image of
57:48 this system to somebody else
57:49 is it a rehearsed one-two-three step to
57:52 someone else are they all in a big giant
57:54 hive mind sharing knowledge throughout
57:58 the entire facility merely through
58:02 proximity
58:03 meaning monkey a might have not touched
58:05 monkey or monkey one-one may not have
58:08 touched monkey 100 any way shape or form
58:10 may not have come within 20 feet of the
58:13 other monkey however one was in contact
58:17 with ten tim was in contact with 20 20
58:19 all the way down to the point where you
58:23 know monkey nighty who learned it from
58:25 all the predecessors upward spent all of
58:27 his time with monkey 100 and some monkey
58:30 100 was a little bit quicker hmm what
58:34 does that mean for the human mind well
58:38 like I've given analogy in the past I've
58:40 learned many instruments from other
58:42 people mainly the guitar that's the
58:46 toughest one I think to learn drums er
58:48 the second thing but you have to
58:50 disconnect your brain to control the
58:51 drums in different you know regions
58:53 piano you can pretty much teach yourself
58:55 that one pretty quick but regardless of
58:58 one instrument you might be learning
58:59 when you learn it with a pro and you're
59:02 in the session in the room with the
59:03 individual and you've spent maybe at
59:05 least an hour with the person they'll
59:08 show you something on the guitar and you
59:09 can do it very quickly it's almost
59:12 effortless now you do have a little bit
59:14 of eye acuity and you can remember how
59:16 they put their fingers on the fret and
59:18 that does help well it's fascinating is
59:21 you go back home or something you may
59:23 have played because your teacher will
59:24 usually if that's a good teacher will
59:26 say okay
59:26 you figure out that little lick now you
59:28 got 20 minutes left in this one-hour
59:30 session I'll play that for 20 minutes
59:32 don't play anything else I'm listening
59:34 ask me any questions if you have any
59:36 questions right she got quite a bit of
59:40 muscle memory 20 minutes and your
59:43 teacher will say go home and do that
59:45 lick every day for two or three hours a
59:47 pop and do the other ones I taught you
59:49 as well but you'll get home I'm gonna be
59:52 tougher especially the next day when you
59:54 wake up and you're shaking all the
59:55 cobwebs out of your brain you're like
59:56 ping pong ping pong you know this is not
59:59 working
60:00 okay how many actors have acting parents
60:05 how many people in any skill whatsoever
60:07 have parents with at least a dangerous
60:10 level of that skill now the kids that we
60:12 know about are like the Mozart's the
60:16 Tiger Woods and all those guys that had
60:18 parents that were definitely dangerously
60:21 good with the art before they taught
60:23 their child but the kid was pressured to
60:25 take it to the next level in the next
60:27 level usually the common denominators
60:30 with those kids is that the parents
60:32 didn't treat them like children like we
60:33 do in the United States in the 21st
60:35 century oh just let them do whatever
60:37 they want until they get to 18 and then
60:39 we'll [ __ ] it come down on them hard
60:41 know exactly what they're you know
60:43 majors should be and they should get
60:44 straight A's or we're not gonna [ __ ] I'd
60:45 pay with their college and sort of an
60:47 [ __ ] formula like that thing is you
60:51 should never treat a child like a child
60:53 in my opinion
60:54 oh you don't to walk in and start
60:56 talking like you know you're some super
60:58 mega scientists and hope they understand
60:59 all the technical terminology you're
61:02 going through now you get a boil it down
61:03 for kids but man they love it when you
61:06 treat them like adults they respect you
61:08 more they put more effort in hand which
61:11 you've done is you've put the archetype
61:12 of how to do something in their brain
61:14 when they are least susceptible for
61:17 things to confuse them they're not
61:19 hugging a bunch of paradigms it says
61:21 what you're saying is impossible right
61:23 member Luke Skywalker and Empire Strikes
61:25 Back the most beautiful phrase when Yoda
61:28 says you know now get your get your
61:30 x-wing fighter out of my [ __ ] pond
61:32 right he's like I can't it's too big and
61:34 you know and he tries it and it fails
61:36 and then and he's like always with you
61:40 what can't be done and he just goes boom
61:42 when he pulls a [ __ ] x-wing fighter
61:44 out a little tiny dude now that's a
61:46 fictitional thing of course but let me
61:48 tell you the amount of times my old man
61:51 did that to me when I said I couldn't do
61:53 something which wasn't very often but it
61:56 was enough and I realized yeah there's
61:58 no such thing as I can't it's just I
62:01 won't that's pretty much it or I'm not
62:03 interested in that and that's like
62:04 there's only legitimate answers you
62:06 could probably give back to the other
62:07 way right now in defense of all parents
62:11 were kept a lot busier these days and we
62:13 were back in the 70s when I got the
62:15 privilege of growing up so I got a
62:17 little more access to two parental
62:20 characters teaching me things from
62:22 uncle's to ants to neighbors parents or
62:24 whatever everybody was always
62:25 contributing to the kids
62:27 but it's no mystery to most of you that
62:29 the DNA double helix is wired exactly
62:32 like an antenna the nucleic acids the
62:34 act G nucleic acids are wired in a
62:38 twisted pair okay well if I say twisted
62:41 pair to any IT person they're thinking
62:44 you have a hundred different wire
62:45 configurations Ethernet RJ what is it RJ
62:49 forty two or whatever it is right forty
62:51 five can't remember the old phone cables
62:53 twisted pair twisted pair go look at an
62:55 antenna on most of the cars go to a mall
62:57 okay if you don't have a media access to
63:00 an antenna look at all the cars in the
63:02 parking lot that actually have a little
63:03 antenna over the rear view mirror up on
63:06 top of the hood of the car I used to
63:07 have an old car that had this and was
63:09 all laminated in a in a rubber kind of
63:12 dip and you could see the structural
63:14 wire which does nothing and then you can
63:16 see the twisted wire around the outside
63:18 edge which was the antenna that's how I
63:21 was receiving the radio got it so your
63:25 whole body is a gigantic antenna this
63:28 hair I got in my head right one of the
63:32 things is I'm a little reluctant of
63:33 cutting it off for is this notion that I
63:37 got I believe very three-dimensional and
63:40 existential as soon as it grew out
63:42 mm-hmm then that article went around the
63:44 web you know I think it's true like
63:47 about Native Americans being very
63:48 spiritual and very connected to the
63:50 earth and life and spirituality in
63:52 general because of their hair and they
63:55 were able to be embedded into military
63:57 forces to do tracking and have sort of
64:00 an instinct about the enemy very
64:03 interesting right is it any wonder that
64:07 I got too much time away handsome no the
64:10 Native Americans with their really long
64:12 hair had a religion the earth was a
64:14 mother everything was everything was one
64:18 giant ecosystem and when white man came
64:21 over and started tearing the place up
64:22 and pulling minerals out of the soil
64:24 they were like you're destroying mother
64:26 you don't understand anything about how
64:28 the world works we're like we know best
64:31 right we got gunpowder well the
64:36 Egyptians also had long hair didn't they
64:38 and I think we have proven beyond the
64:40 shadow of a doubt in the last 10
64:41 years that the Egyptians were beyond
64:44 spiritual okay these individuals learned
64:48 about the brain before they had before
64:52 they had any medical equipment to really
64:53 analyze the brain sure they could crack
64:55 open a head and look at a bunch of gray
64:56 matter and stuff while covered in blood
64:58 or whatever but what did they do right I
65:03 get some people everyone small very
65:04 rarely but I get him everyone smile like
65:06 who are you man where's your degree in
65:08 this and that you I suppose you're an
65:10 expert like when I talk about 911 and
65:12 basic physics they want me to have a PhD
65:15 in physics before I know that you know a
65:18 floor impacting a floor below is going
65:20 to take a fraction of a second to occur
65:22 it's not gonna freefall you know a
65:24 hundred hundred stories of a building's
65:26 not gonna freeze fall in 100 seconds let
65:28 alone six and a half seconds right
65:32 all right I'm gonna give you a nice
65:35 little reply for people who throw that
65:37 [ __ ] at you and we're gonna use our
65:40 friends the Egyptians okay I talked to
65:46 some NSA guys once at a party you've
65:48 heard me refer to this a few times never
65:51 talking about 9/11 this is 2007 six or
65:55 seven Christmas party my buddy was
65:58 holding the party said you gotta come
65:59 over talk to these guys and they need to
66:01 talk to you and I sat down and these are
66:03 older you know older gentleman I would
66:04 say probably in their 60s and we start
66:07 talking about all the physics the 9/11
66:09 bah-bah-bah and they threw up this
66:12 defense mechanism they're kubler-ross
66:13 denial mechanism was facilitated by
66:15 trying to ask me what all my degrees
66:18 were obviously knowing that if I even
66:21 had a PhD in physics that they would
66:23 [ __ ] in moan like a bunch of [ __ ]
66:24 that I didn't have one in metallurgy or
66:27 something or aviation right I had to
66:28 have [ __ ] PhD in everything to have
66:31 any opinion in the room right a lot of
66:33 stuff is covered again in basic physics
66:36 in high school okay
66:37 the irony is is that they're calling out
66:40 their own ignorance for having not
66:42 taking the most basic classes in high
66:44 school
66:45 okay but anyway you reply today given to
66:49 you by your humble narrator is how many
66:52 degrees did the engineers of the
66:53 pyramids have Brainiac
66:56 oh well it's kind of funny that they
67:00 didn't have any degrees either but hmm
67:03 those pyramids still exist [ __ ]
67:06 right they exist so mr. genius
67:11 once you go find all your PhD friends
67:13 that you have full respect for and have
67:16 them build us a pyramid oh they've
67:20 already tried it and they can't they
67:22 can't figure out how things were built
67:23 they're based on PI right now we look at
67:27 them and they're big giant batteries
67:28 with different conductivity in the
67:30 limestone and and red granite Oh hmm
67:34 maybe you can know something without
67:37 some [ __ ] institution giving you a
67:39 piece of paper right mm-hmm have fun
67:43 with these people with the rest of our
67:44 lives now then does it mean does it mean
67:47 you can just know everything by sitting
67:49 around oh maybe but it's better if you
67:52 do a bunch of research at the same time
67:53 right you can't listen to the truth of
67:56 my opinion you can I know I might sound
67:58 absurd to some folks and you've
68:00 definitely got some friends of yours
68:03 that are probably big conspiracy theory
68:05 people that don't seem like they have
68:06 any of that knowledge but already you
68:09 know backing for their belief systems so
68:11 I think we know how to discern those
68:13 folks in 2019 maybe in 20 2005 we didn't
68:16 quite have that power but you've heard
68:18 me talk about the fact that we know that
68:22 people have panic attacks in this world
68:24 there's probably many contributing
68:27 factors I think one of the biggest
68:28 contributing factors that I have found a
68:32 lot of people agree with who are older
68:33 and they've seen the difference between
68:36 when they grew up in the 40s 50s 60s 70s
68:40 80s and today is that we have simply
68:43 allowed the corporate world to put
68:45 pressures on us that we're not
68:46 biologically suited for right we work
68:49 too many hours there's not any time off
68:51 we have too many responsibilities the
68:54 economy which drives everything that we
68:57 do is variants
68:58 stable our education systems the worst
69:00 that's ever been eccentric cetera right
69:03 but sometimes anxiety attacks are very
69:06 very specific they don't have to do with
69:09 money they don't have to do with any
69:11 overall burden of life some people have
69:13 anxiety of driving a car
69:15 well that doesn't come from any
69:17 real-life threat right now driving a car
69:22 when you really conceptually think about
69:24 what's at risk you know you could drive
69:25 into someone hurt someone hurt your car
69:27 what have you you could drive head-on
69:30 into somebody you can conceive of a lot
69:33 of penalties as a result of not doing it
69:36 correctly of course but the more I think
69:40 about the electricity of the mind and
69:42 the ten monkey experience 100 the
69:44 hundred monkey experiment is typically
69:46 referred to him the circles that I
69:47 bumped into is the ten monkey probably
69:50 simply because it's easier to say but if
69:53 we're communicating between each other
69:55 then all of our neighbors matter to
69:58 society as a whole matters fake news
70:01 matters propaganda matters not only as
70:05 an educational thing but as sort of the
70:08 susceptibility of believing it right I
70:13 think I know who posted this on our page
70:16 the locked Facebook page but there was a
70:21 picture of a burning cell phone tower
70:23 and it said something to the effect of
70:25 as soon as we win the revolution these
70:27 are the first to go meaning we got to
70:30 get rid of all these cell phone towers
70:32 now again I have a whole episode on the
70:35 5g debut of cell phone technology or
70:38 cellular technology the advancement of a
70:41 much tighter frequency it's going to be
70:42 an utter bombardment to the human body
70:44 you can expect leukemia and diabetes to
70:47 just fly off the charts when this stuff
70:49 is debuted we don't have any control or
70:52 at least we're allowing them excuse me
70:54 to install this kind of stuff that
70:57 bombards our bodies without having any
70:59 legal methodology of saying I don't want
71:02 this [ __ ] [ __ ] hitting my body right
71:04 I don't want it sorry my little
71:06 neighborhood is gonna have a little
71:07 blackout of 5g I don't give a [ __ ] if
71:09 every neighbor hates me for it I'm gonna
71:11 live longer
71:12 and so will they right there's something
71:15 called harp it's a technology based on
71:17 Tesla technology there several harp
71:20 antennas as I understand them hidden all
71:22 over the world they're extremely
71:23 powerful and they can bounce big giant
71:26 frequencies off of the ionosphere down
71:29 onto human beings yeah well it sounds a
71:32 little weird to me doesn't it but now
71:35 imagine that you need to believe
71:38 something that you're not going to
71:39 believe some propaganda perhaps you need
71:42 to feel soothed during a really bad
71:44 experience perhaps you need to be in
71:46 their opinion very excited and bothered
71:49 and susceptible to programming at a
71:51 different time something that's gonna
71:53 happen in the world they're gonna hit us
71:54 all with this susceptibility wave okay
71:57 knocking us down using the electricity
71:59 in our mind to make us feel comfortable
72:03 with whatever propaganda comes across
72:05 the internet the TV whatever that
72:08 technology already exists people okay
72:11 again a lot of CIA agents defected in
72:14 the 90s and said well mind control is
72:16 completely figured out by 96 we were
72:19 done we were done with every variable we
72:21 could come up with you know not sure how
72:24 much of that's true we have definitely
72:28 embedded microchips inside bowls and you
72:31 wave the red flag and then they run at
72:32 you and you hit that thing and they just
72:34 that is more of a inhibitor of using the
72:37 brain at all which is why the bull looks
72:40 like he is going into convulsions that's
72:43 not the same thing
72:43 okay it's kind of in the same wheelhouse
72:46 as the technology it's not the same
72:48 thing if you could make the bull dance
72:51 or act like a puppy dog and then
72:54 probably you've got more proof right we
72:56 need to understand that our bodies are
72:58 designed to work in a particular way the
73:01 reason why we don't eat motor oil and
73:03 Drano is because we're not supposed to
73:06 it doesn't work with our ecosystem it
73:08 tears us down kills us stops our motor
73:10 from working reason why abusing drugs
73:13 can permanently screw up your entire
73:16 identity while you're on them some of
73:18 them will destroy you permanently by
73:21 taking away genetic formations in your
73:24 brain creating a little ant
73:25 ant trails inside your brain as they say
73:28 was the MDMA will give you brain damage
73:32 every single time you take it
73:34 unrepairable is what they say not quite
73:37 sure about unrepairable but what if it
73:39 just does a lot of damage you take a lot
73:41 of drugs and it destroys 20 years of
73:42 your growth perhaps it it destroys
73:46 enough of the circuits that even if you
73:47 gain back the mechanical capability that
73:50 is that was missing you know you take
73:52 drugs if you took drugs a lot for one
73:54 year well you blow out twenty years in
73:56 one year well even if you stop it takes
73:59 you another what 20 40 60 years to
74:02 repair 20 years with the genetic damage
74:03 why take the risk
74:05 right you want to be in control your
74:07 life or not control your life right a
74:09 lot of people just want to avoid pain
74:11 but a lot of times when people itemize
74:14 their lives for the things that that
74:17 well mother of invention moments where
74:19 they actually nut it up and got the next
74:22 layer of their life started and we're
74:23 very proud of the accomplishment it was
74:25 due to pain right so sometimes pain is
74:28 your best friend
74:29 sometimes it's completely overwhelming
74:31 believe me I understand but as you think
74:34 about every organ in your body I want
74:38 you to think about whether or not the
74:40 electrical signals are something you
74:44 could potentially control obviously
74:47 everything that is on the outside of
74:49 your body is very useful for this
74:52 conversation your skin is very very
74:54 useful all of your sensory inputs your
74:57 eyes your ears your mouth all that stuff
75:00 is very very important I want you to
75:03 remember that phrase I mentioned I
75:04 believe in the alien consciousness
75:06 episode which is that what you nourish
75:09 is what grows inside of you right so
75:12 when you think about this neural peptide
75:15 mechanism where the more that you think
75:17 that your Arnold Schwarzenegger or your
75:19 whatever claudia schiffer or whatever it
75:23 is you want to be you can think of your
75:26 father your mother your grandfather your
75:27 grandmother who but whomever you want to
75:29 be but the image of yourself to the
75:32 degree you can see it as truly what you
75:35 are
75:37 it will create those neuropeptides that
75:39 descend into your body and start to
75:41 construct that exact image of yourself
75:43 if you say well I like being young I'm
75:48 gonna keep this well that's what your
75:50 body will attempt to do to its maximum
75:51 capability now will you see me at age 18
75:55 I look exactly the same
75:56 of course not right one could contest
75:59 well maybe if you could keep yourself
76:01 thinking that you'll you will look like
76:04 you are when you're 30 or whatever hmm I
76:07 think what will happen is is it you'll
76:08 probably look the best 80 you could
76:10 possibly look right now again you do
76:13 have to you know survey what you put
76:16 into your body both mentally physically
76:18 and spiritually right got to get bad
76:20 people out of your life any the
76:22 negativity around you is got to be gone
76:23 if you're in a situation in your life
76:25 that seems like you can't escape it okay
76:29 you know job that you got a key for a
76:31 couple years or whatever well look about
76:33 look at how many years you got left in
76:35 your life and make the decision well I
76:37 can eat I can eat two crappy years maybe
76:40 I only have to eat it for one but again
76:42 if you have an employment that's solid
76:45 and you need to change your job well use
76:47 your employment time to go find the
76:50 better job instead of waiting for you to
76:51 lose the job and then you're in a panic
76:52 state about everything in your life
76:54 because your bills are due and you don't
76:55 have any money right so I think this is
77:00 about all I have with this particular
77:01 one but I wanted to touch on the subject
77:03 because I want you to start thinking
77:04 about yourself as a completely
77:06 electrical creature and then dial back
77:08 to my episodes about everything in the
77:10 universe being electrical right the Sun
77:12 the earth the moon everything is
77:13 electrical right so we're being fed by
77:16 the Sun you know one of the things I
77:19 want to put in your mind to this is just
77:21 sort of a footnote towards other
77:24 episodes that I've covered is we always
77:28 talk about ether all energy on this
77:30 particular show and it dawned on me of
77:33 the day when I got up really late at
77:35 night and it was cold in my house and I
77:40 realized you know it's a very
77:41 interesting thing that what cold is is
77:44 stationary objects right the less
77:46 something vibrates the more cold it is
77:48 and the more vibrates the more it
77:49 is agitating greets Heat right well the
77:53 idea that we can stand in a cold room
77:57 you were totally warm in your sheets or
77:59 whatever now you're standing in a cold
78:01 room and you feel yourself get colder
78:03 right well something that still
78:06 shouldn't have the ability to infect you
78:09 with what it does because it's still
78:11 right when I stand up next to my dresser
78:13 is a in terms of atomic mass it's a
78:17 still object and I don't become my
78:18 dresser just because I stand next to it
78:20 I don't even become my dresser if I sit
78:21 on it right it might make me cold but
78:27 there's this constant exchange with all
78:30 of the atomic mass we have around us
78:33 right and it sounds like a very stupid
78:36 trivial thing to mention but there's
78:39 this you know I keep telling you that
78:41 you're a renewing ether all being you're
78:44 a bunch of spiral spheres probably of
78:48 ether all winds and they go up to create
78:51 all the Tomic components that we
78:53 recognize today from quarks all the way
78:55 up to everything we see as an atomic
78:57 compound or what have you I say that to
79:00 use so that you realize how susceptible
79:02 you are and I am and everyone is to your
79:05 environment you know there's nothing
79:08 better than waking up in the summertime
79:09 and your house is nice and just perfect
79:12 it's not too hot it's not too cold and
79:14 you can go the restroom or go in the
79:16 kitchen and find yourself something to
79:18 drink and you're not being made
79:20 uncomfortable by the coldness of your of
79:22 your home some of your like by a robe
79:26 and get over dude I find them so
79:29 restricting don't you we have to
79:33 understand where electrical and then
79:36 when we look at the technologies that
79:37 are wrapping around us our cell phones
79:39 our computers our wireless networks our
79:41 wireless cell phone towers and any other
79:43 thing like radio and other military
79:45 things that are being transmitted
79:47 constantly we actually do have a
79:49 sovereign right to say I don't want your
79:52 technology up my ass literally I don't
79:55 want you bombarding my body was
79:56 something that will make leukemia cells
79:59 in my body I don't want you giving me
80:01 you know
80:02 a frequency that's going to over
80:05 stimulate my insulin or [ __ ] my
80:09 insulin so that I become diabetic go
80:12 look that one up if you haven't been to
80:15 deep thoughts radio though deeper out
80:17 deep thoughts radio calm man say that a
80:19 bunch of times please do you can change
80:22 your feed from audio to video and video
80:23 to audio if you have a Facebook account
80:25 and you just want a really really fun
80:28 low-impact way to learn new things and
80:30 expand your mind and again use your mind
80:33 in a very intelligent way highly
80:35 recommend you click the Facebook link
80:36 join the group it is locked because we
80:38 keep out a lot of the the bots that way
80:40 it's a beautiful thing those of you who
80:43 like to become sort of in the back stage
80:45 pass get these episodes a couple days
80:48 earlier than everybody else in most
80:50 cases please join the patreon group you
80:53 can join for $1.00 you get all the stuff
80:55 early release there's a store link up
80:59 there as well anyway take care of
81:01 yourself in someone else and I'll see in
81:02 the next deep thoughts over now
81:04 [Music]
81:13 you
