00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep dots ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:36 so i just got done finishing uh an edit
00:39 on five
00:40 four five and i'm sitting there thinking
00:43 man
00:44 i i really want to create an episode
00:46 there's a bunch that i have to do some
00:49 minor research for a couple i gotta do
00:52 maybe some big research for
00:54 it's only about 10 50 on a saturday
00:56 night so i was thinking about
00:59 the origin of us
01:03 and a whole slew of ideas just flew into
01:05 my head
01:07 and i had some cart before the horse
01:09 things that i have said in the past that
01:11 i want to call
01:12 out because it's very mysterious once
01:15 you
01:16 understand sort of the chicken and the
01:20 egg sort of thing
01:21 that we have been sort of taking for
01:23 granted
01:24 there's only one example i know of where
01:26 this isn't an issue
01:29 but i'm going to call this the ancient
01:32 mind
01:33 now technically speaking i'm going to
01:34 probably mix up the word
01:37 mind for your consciousness which i
01:39 think you're
01:40 you know there's something we have to
01:42 call if you're spiritual and you believe
01:45 in a soul
01:46 again forget all organized religion it
01:48 has nothing to do with this
01:50 maybe an organized religion got some of
01:52 our views way before we did
01:54 but that's just gonna be happenstance
01:57 right
01:58 but we have to have what we call our
02:00 consciousness in the soul form
02:03 and then we have to have our
02:04 consciousness in the physical form
02:06 which is typically referenced as the
02:08 mind
02:10 when it combines with the body that we
02:12 know as
02:13 homo sapien sapien
02:16 that every other life that we believe
02:18 has consciousness
02:20 a cat a dog all animals but now
02:24 here's something that struck me this
02:27 evening
02:29 which is i have said to you guys several
02:30 times perhaps dreams
02:32 are a preview of what we all call
02:36 heaven that is if you don't have any
02:38 nightmares of course
02:40 but then i thought wait a minute what do
02:43 i dream of
02:44 i dream of beautiful timeless facsimiles
02:49 of this
02:50 world meaning i'll be at a place a bunch
02:53 of dream people
02:54 every once in a while a relative shows
02:56 up but it's pretty rare and that's
02:57 usually to wake me up
03:00 but even if it is a relative they don't
03:02 usually act like your real relatives
03:05 you just impose on them that that's who
03:07 they are and so you keep telling
03:09 yourself
03:10 that they behave like however they
03:11 behaved in your dream
03:13 they're not really the same person but
03:16 now
03:16 let's just take this chicken and egg
03:19 thing of
03:20 souls coming first bodies coming second
03:24 the perhaps souls as i have mentioned in
03:26 my origin
03:28 what is the origin of man episode many
03:30 many moons ago
03:32 that we were all soul beings first
03:35 however that occurred
03:37 perhaps you know again having to endorse
03:40 a very heavy heavy concept
03:42 of having no birth and simply being an
03:45 is
03:46 but we'll get into that in a second but
03:49 we dream of this reality
03:52 in most cases there are definitely
03:53 abstract dreams that
03:55 we've all had most likely where you're
03:58 just i used to dream i was like a
04:01 a cell probably the best way to describe
04:04 like a human cell
04:06 inside of a bunch of other cells it was
04:08 this weird thing i used to have when i
04:09 was a kid
04:10 it was what i would typically call my
04:12 frustration dream
04:14 but for the most part we dream houses
04:16 and locations and people
04:19 but if we had never been
04:23 a human being or any other being if
04:26 earth didn't exist if homes didn't exist
04:28 as you perceive them today
04:30 what would we have dreamed in the past
04:34 earth doesn't exist yet and you can get
04:37 you can
04:38 secretly in your mind apply this to
04:39 biblical thinking as well
04:41 garden of eden doesn't exist yet now of
04:44 course there's
04:46 if the reason why i want to stay away
04:47 from religion is that it imposes
04:50 a chronology which may metaphorically
04:54 have some significance but
04:56 not for our conversation at all which
04:57 would be
04:59 there's always this story that god
05:03 suddenly existed or god has always
05:06 existed
05:08 which makes god an is he doesn't have a
05:11 beginning middle and end
05:12 he isn't his he simply is and always has
05:15 been
05:16 then where do we come from where do our
05:18 souls come from
05:20 well some of the wisest people that have
05:22 ever lived on planet earth
05:24 typically gravitate to an association
05:27 with your god
05:29 we are a fragment of god
05:32 a flake of skin and adam from god
05:35 just for metaphorical reference
05:39 again the first story of the creation of
05:40 the universe that
05:42 joseph campbell came up with was that
05:47 in africa he found a story that said
05:50 that
05:50 god was asleep and when god awoke he
05:53 exploded
05:55 and we are the exploded particles off
05:58 god's body
05:59 that then landed on celestial bodies
06:01 which were already here is the first way
06:03 the story was told until someone
06:04 logistically said now wait a minute
06:06 where did everything else come from and
06:08 so they retold the story with an upgrade
06:10 that said that the planets stars and
06:12 moons
06:12 also came from god's body whatever
06:16 they're just trying to explain something
06:18 that they don't understand
06:20 but what i think is beautiful about that
06:22 association is that
06:24 the miracle of man is then inherently
06:26 explained because we are inherently
06:29 a part of god made in his own image
06:32 oh yeah because you are a part of him
06:36 him just being a reference so if there's
06:39 any
06:40 sentiment to that whatsoever the very
06:43 interesting question about the entire
06:45 argument would be i definitely
06:49 i'm sitting here in this patio and i
06:51 don't have anyone else's thoughts going
06:52 through my head in a really conscious
06:54 way
06:55 maybe subconsciously someone's having a
06:57 good day across the street and i'm
06:58 feeling pretty
07:00 positive today but if someone has a
07:03 death in the family in a different
07:04 direction i might have sort of a bummer
07:06 day and i don't even know why because
07:07 i'm picking up on their vibe
07:10 the real paradox that it just blows my
07:12 mind
07:13 way beyond trying to account for god's
07:16 existence
07:18 is that at some point a marriage between
07:22 the spiritual realm
07:23 and this for lack of a better term mass
07:26 rome
07:27 occurred and it would seem that this
07:31 combination you could almost call it an
07:34 infection
07:36 the soul energy started to participate
07:38 perhaps in even controlling
07:41 the distribution of what i might refer
07:44 to as ether
07:46 from the most microscopic level of being
07:49 that we see inside of a petri dish
07:51 i mean you know every time we see these
07:53 little guys roam around
07:55 at a petri dish they seem like they have
07:57 little brains and they're moving around
07:58 they have instinctual motors just like
08:00 everything else above their
08:03 life constructs ants have this amazing
08:08 hive mind thing they do
08:09 i mean when they especially the ones in
08:11 south america and africa where they
08:13 create those little bridges with their
08:14 bodies
08:15 they understand water tension and so
08:17 they can
08:18 push themselves down and hold the water
08:20 down
08:21 i mean it is really unbelievable
08:24 when you take into account the fact that
08:26 their lifespan is so damn short
08:29 but they immediately know what to do in
08:31 a crisis
08:34 that's stunning octopus
08:37 or squid live less than a year's life
08:41 but there's no question that their
08:44 their form attracts a very intelligent
08:48 life force now if we subtract
08:52 from the next observation uh
08:55 what i believe to be a fake paradigm of
08:59 paleontology otherwise known as
09:01 dinosaurs
09:02 get rid of them out of your brain you
09:04 know the ecosystem of most life forms is
09:07 that we go from the smallest life form
09:08 to the largest life form
09:10 so the idea that these big giant things
09:12 came before man is sort of laughable
09:14 or whatever it has to do with the
09:17 research and all that stuff which i've
09:18 talked about a lot lately
09:20 but we still have whales and elephants
09:22 and dolphins and
09:25 and yeah you'll have people joke that
09:28 these
09:29 creatures are potentially smarter than
09:30 men but they really aren't
09:33 when you see an elephant you know in the
09:36 wild you know rush
09:38 a tourist jeep
09:41 it's not a very intelligent being they
09:44 supposedly have this amazing memory
09:47 and when these jeeps drive by on the
09:49 street with that
09:50 label on them and you see people without
09:52 guns
09:53 and they just have cameras and some of
09:55 them have food the elephant should have
09:57 the basic concept that
09:59 those aren't poachers these are tourists
10:02 and this is where i get a bunch of my
10:04 food the bears seem to have figured it
10:06 out half the time right where they
10:07 they wave at their mouths on the side of
10:09 the road the reason why i bring them up
10:12 and all beings that are typically
10:16 bigger than man in terms of cranial
10:18 space
10:20 is that you would think that a larger
10:22 creature having pretty much the same
10:24 amount of time on earth
10:26 we have been on earth would at least
10:28 possess
10:29 an equal level of capability that we
10:32 have
10:34 now i'm going to get into the brain
10:36 chambers just
10:37 briefly but a gorilla
10:40 an orangutan yes they knew a little bit
10:42 of sign language here and there but come
10:44 on
10:44 where's their written language where are
10:46 their cities and their machines
10:50 where's their science where's their
10:52 culture where's their poetry
10:54 it doesn't exist now
10:57 we have different chambers of the brain
10:58 that account for
11:00 the in my opinion the permeability of
11:04 the soul into this
11:05 particular design and human beings are
11:08 second to none on this planet however we
11:11 are genetically configured
11:13 the brain offers a perfect
11:16 computer for the operating system that
11:19 is the soul
11:21 a dolphin has more cerebellum space
11:24 which is
11:25 the muscle memory to swim so even though
11:27 their brains are
11:28 bigger than human being brains on
11:30 average it is mostly associated with
11:32 swimming
11:34 i'm assuming that most creatures have
11:36 that same distribution
11:38 but why i think they have a soul
11:42 i do think they have some consciousness
11:44 in them they cry
11:46 they laugh they play why wouldn't they
11:50 over the course of the same however many
11:52 millions of years we've been here
11:56 have the same or similar capability
11:59 and or why wouldn't they be able to do
12:01 monkey sea monkey do
12:03 and copy us and yes i've seen elephants
12:06 paint pictures on canvas and all
12:11 a lot of animals doing very intelligent
12:12 things obviously dolphins do a bunch of
12:14 swimming
12:15 according to douglas adams they were the
12:16 second smartest being on planet earth
12:18 the mice being the
12:19 number one but there's this weird
12:24 epiphany that each human being has who
12:27 gains
12:28 just a mild level of consciousness
12:32 that you look at all the other creatures
12:33 and insects and birds and fish and all
12:36 that stuff
12:37 and there's a weird there's a bunch of
12:40 mixed emotions
12:41 one you're very you feel fortunate and
12:44 privileged
12:45 that you are a being that has as much
12:47 intelligence as you have
12:49 at the other side of the game you feel
12:53 a little frustrated that you're the only
12:54 one
12:56 that the sort of middle-earth of jr
13:00 tolkien
13:01 doesn't really exist in a way that we
13:04 have
13:05 we don't have true dwarf races
13:09 which aren't made out of uh you know
13:12 congenital medical complications but
13:14 that's just how they
13:16 that's just how they live fully
13:18 functional fully amazing now
13:20 obviously are as they call themselves
13:23 little people
13:25 have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt
13:26 that there are very few limitations
13:29 for them but wouldn't it be cool to have
13:32 elves and maybe not ogres
13:34 but you know why wouldn't we have
13:38 tons of species on this planet if
13:40 evolution is the way we got here
13:43 it took me a long time before i heard
13:45 someone say well if we evolve from
13:48 monkeys then why the hell are monkeys
13:50 still here
13:52 it's a real simple thing i mean
13:54 obviously you can throw a little
13:57 theory out the door and just go well you
13:59 know it's because they branched off
14:01 and they went one way it's like no no
14:04 they would not be as primitive as they
14:06 are today
14:07 i mean ridiculously primitive we should
14:09 have
14:12 damn near humanoid level folks
14:15 that are of these species in my opinion
14:19 but we don't a gorilla being able to do
14:23 sign language
14:25 well you know a dog can also go bite his
14:28 bowl and bring it to you and say i'm
14:29 hungry
14:31 for me that's about the same thing
14:34 i think what's interesting about staring
14:36 at a gorilla especially
14:38 as opposed to orangutan or chimpanzee is
14:40 that
14:41 gorillas can really give you an amazing
14:46 uh approximation of a human face
14:49 which makes us go whoa man that's just
14:53 it's like my uncle larry you know i mean
14:55 whatever it is it's like there's
14:56 something
14:57 about how they might make expressions
14:59 that
15:00 really start to mix up the bag
15:04 let's go back to pure soul realm
15:08 prior to having any physicality
15:12 because there's a great correlation
15:13 between
15:16 programming artificial intelligence back
15:18 in the day
15:19 and being a pure soul with absolutely no
15:22 option
15:23 but to be a pure soul perhaps with other
15:25 pure souls
15:27 imagine you are floating
15:30 in a realm and floating is even a
15:32 relative term that may not even be
15:34 applicable here
15:35 but you simply exist at a level of
15:38 consciousness
15:39 that you know that you are there i think
15:42 therefore i am
15:43 that's all that you've ever accomplished
15:45 in this pure soul form
15:48 you don't have any instrumentalities
15:49 whatsoever you don't have a body
15:51 you don't have eyes ears nose
15:55 there's no touch perhaps at that point
15:58 we are pure emotion
16:00 pure emotion hopefully a positive
16:03 spectrum of emotion
16:05 now if we stem from a larger being
16:08 outside of this realm of existence
16:10 meaning we are essentially branches of a
16:12 tree
16:13 that when the branch touches this realm
16:17 we get to become what we are but as soon
16:20 as we lift off of this realm
16:22 as a result of passing away because our
16:25 instrumentalities got
16:26 rearranged or aged out of operability
16:30 we simply pull out of this realm
16:34 and we're not lost we're not alone
16:36 because we are part of the tree branch
16:39 and immediately we realize that this is
16:41 what we are
16:43 now i promised you there was an
16:44 experience that i had heard of that is
16:48 an interesting example of what that
16:51 world might be like and it's got one
16:54 complication
16:56 and that there's another added element
16:58 to many people's experiences
17:01 but when i hear about people and i did
17:04 most of my research about 10 years ago
17:05 on dmt
17:07 you get two experiences the one i keep
17:09 mentioning recently is a buddy of mine
17:11 who
17:12 is a genius and he always had a
17:17 an usher who was a great alien he was
17:20 very happy to take him
17:22 where he ended up going in the universe
17:26 up until the last trip where he
17:28 basically said you're abusing this
17:30 go home but he still had the full he had
17:33 the full trip
17:35 while being told go home and he said man
17:36 i never want to be home more of my life
17:38 and this guy is a very strong-minded
17:41 individual
17:42 but the first dmt experiences i had read
17:45 about in the book
17:46 the dream molecule it didn't really talk
17:49 about the grays or any aliens at all
17:51 you simply became pure light
17:54 and a lot of folks said that you go
17:58 hurling across the universe
18:02 essentially to god himself and the
18:05 entire time that you're going there
18:07 it's like you're in some amusement park
18:09 or some club med
18:11 in a metaphor or you're passing groups
18:14 of souls that are also pure light that
18:16 just look
18:16 beautiful and everything feels wonderful
18:20 and you definitely got the sense from
18:22 these people that as they saw other
18:24 groups of
18:24 beings that one they weren't compacted
18:28 like
18:29 cells and an epidermis that they were
18:32 free-floating they were choosing to be
18:33 together
18:35 but that everyone was extremely happy it
18:38 was the closest definition to heaven
18:40 i think i've ever heard put into words
18:43 but imagine that
18:44 just for a few seconds
18:47 you have no body you don't have a memory
18:50 of a body because you've never had one
18:52 ever you're just consciousness
18:56 and then it begs the question
18:59 this stuff that we apparently are using
19:01 to become physical
19:04 where we can shake hands and hug each
19:06 other and craft something
19:08 because we're displacing mass
19:11 where did this stuff come from as
19:12 fundamental as it might be
19:14 let's say i'm totally correct about the
19:18 the og gods of electricity who
19:22 discovered ether it's a chargeless
19:25 particle
19:26 it's a single particle but it goes into
19:29 various
19:30 states as it bumps into its neighbors
19:34 okay let's say that's right where'd it
19:36 come from
19:38 now it's not important honestly that we
19:40 answer that particular question
19:43 someone might say well god made it and
19:46 therefore it exists
19:48 what's fundamentally fascinating about
19:50 that is that we have
19:54 a spiritual realm creating a matter room
19:58 or is it or
20:01 is it now most of the unified theories
20:05 that have been suggested about the
20:06 universe meaning a theory that explains
20:08 everything
20:10 absolutely negates any spiritual realm
20:13 but in this conversation we're
20:16 polarizing the argument in the absolute
20:18 opposite direction
20:20 we don't sense any
20:23 well it there's actually been
20:25 experiments where one the
20:27 the body loses i forgot how many ounces
20:29 when it dies
20:30 instantaneously although when i did the
20:32 research on that
20:33 they said that no one could confirm it
20:35 and you'd think that'd be pretty damn
20:36 easy to confirm
20:39 if nothing else just a bed i think would
20:41 change
20:42 shape just a tad if the human being lost
20:45 even
20:45 a pound of weight a spring would go
20:49 you know i mean something would happen
20:51 but the
20:52 way that one could describe mass if it
20:55 doesn't truly
20:57 exist as we have perceived it is to take
21:01 the dream world of which we
21:05 perceive to be real while we're in the
21:08 dream
21:10 however because of our research in the
21:13 last five years we have definitely
21:14 identified that one does not have
21:16 true arms and legs in those realms
21:19 we just believe that we do up to a point
21:23 it's funny a friend of mine just told me
21:26 it was really funny you know i told you
21:28 that i figured out i didn't have arms
21:29 and legs for real
21:30 when i tried to transcribe a phone
21:32 number during a dream and my
21:34 my hands were like spaghetti
21:37 and my friend she was saying recently
21:41 she had the same exact experience she
21:44 was trying to write something down or
21:45 trying to do something with her hands
21:46 they just wouldn't work right
21:47 she kind of went on past that point i
21:49 said now wait a minute
21:51 it's because you don't actually have
21:52 those things when you're in a dream
21:54 oh okay you know so there's definitely a
21:58 difference we know
21:59 about being geniuses that there's a
22:02 tangibility difference you don't really
22:05 in my opinion have much in the way of
22:07 touch
22:08 in a dream and if you have i think it
22:12 might be a muscle spasm on the outside
22:14 world which might be
22:15 triggered by the dream to give you that
22:17 emotion
22:18 or sorry give you that sense of touch
22:21 or like i've experienced a couple times
22:24 you know i've had a cold room
22:26 and i felt a uh a zombie
22:30 almost a comical zombie come down and
22:32 kind of breathe on my neck
22:35 and he wasn't going to bite me because i
22:36 wasn't going to let him but the real
22:38 reason i was feeling his cold breath on
22:40 my neck was that i had the covers off
22:43 and it was very very cold in my room but
22:46 now what if
22:46 the whole thing about being
22:50 real quote unquote
22:53 is simply a a state of mind that we have
22:56 all put ourselves into
22:59 and as i've suggested several times this
23:01 consensus reality theory
23:03 is that we get enough of us together
23:06 in a pocket of the world or pocket of
23:08 the universe i should say
23:10 and we just agree on something we just
23:14 agree
23:15 in order to create some sort of
23:20 substrate to survive infinity
23:25 because forever is a long time i once
23:28 had a thought
23:29 several years ago that there were a
23:33 group of souls to call on that
23:37 that we're acting as the medium and then
23:40 a group of souls
23:41 that actually are in the medium
23:44 and what do i mean how many times have
23:48 you
23:51 seen someone stage dive and get caught
23:54 properly
23:56 and then they get carried around
23:58 especially lead singers
24:00 and they get carried around by hands
24:03 all around the pit area while they're
24:05 still singing on the mic
24:07 and then they get you know and then they
24:08 get pushed back up on stage and of
24:10 course every kid whoever sees that wants
24:11 to become a rock star just so they can
24:13 do it
24:14 some people have experimented with
24:16 jumping off the stage and
24:18 had varying levels of success with that
24:21 but in that analogy the hands of the
24:23 other individuals are providing the
24:25 medium by which
24:28 this layer of resistance
24:31 exists well it's not a it's not a
24:35 fundamental field of the universe it's
24:38 just a bunch of human beings
24:39 pushing you up with their hands and the
24:42 interesting metaphor
24:43 the whole thing is it's fun for the
24:45 person who gets to do it
24:48 what if you are doing that
24:51 every single day that your very
24:54 existence
24:55 is a
24:58 version of crowdsurfing
25:01 except you get to be who you are and it
25:04 also accounts for everything else that
25:05 you interact with
25:07 i think that's fascinating but now let's
25:10 go to the ancient mind
25:13 you are let's just say first
25:16 a soul for lack of a better term
25:20 and second you become a living being
25:22 regardless if you go through insects
25:24 first
25:24 animal second and then human last and
25:27 maybe
25:28 well i should not be so arrogant but for
25:31 now you're human
25:33 because you can hear my voice
25:36 but you're out there in the universe
25:41 and what i think is very interesting is
25:43 we as human beings
25:45 often will think about the idea of going
25:48 to the afterlife
25:50 and we want to have a couple things
25:52 occur
25:54 one we want to have the truth of a bunch
25:56 of the mysteries that we gained
25:58 here in this world two we want to have
26:02 experiences that we built up
26:04 a lust for in this world that we weren't
26:07 able to achieve
26:09 a career meeting a famous person meeting
26:12 a person in your family or an old friend
26:15 but now think about prior to ever
26:17 becoming a living thing
26:20 but maybe this is eons and eons ago
26:23 or maybe it was always this way how much
26:26 intelligence could you have in the
26:27 universe
26:28 if you never really manifested into
26:31 anything but the soul that you are
26:34 what would you know about anything what
26:36 would you need to know about anything
26:38 would you need to know about any of this
26:42 offhand i can't think of anything you
26:44 would need to know
26:45 all that would need to be known is who
26:49 you are with because where you are
26:53 is sort of moot isn't it who cares just
26:56 like i said in one of my previous
26:57 episodes soul time
26:59 you don't have any worries about time
27:01 time's not something that
27:03 constrains you in the least you could
27:05 live as long as you want and so will all
27:07 of your friends and family
27:09 family being obviously a relative term
27:11 to being once
27:12 born but once you're born
27:16 into a living being of any kind but
27:18 especially a human b a human being
27:21 where there's a lot of
27:25 cognitive awareness man we start to
27:28 develop
27:29 time time thoughts
27:34 i'm not sure that there's any being i
27:37 can name
27:38 that actually conceives of time even
27:41 though
27:42 we can see the history of their growth
27:44 meaning a puppy dog
27:46 a butterfly an ant or a
27:49 great white whale or a great white shark
27:52 or something right
27:53 but we are cursed
27:57 with this realization
28:00 but we might also be blessed by it
28:04 i'll leave that to you to you to decide
28:05 how that works out
28:07 but all of a sudden being a being in
28:10 this form
28:11 takes on all this extra stuff you do
28:14 care about history
28:16 well who am i who was grandpa who was
28:18 grandma
28:20 what'd you look like when you were
28:22 younger oh man i remember
28:24 the 80s you know i mean you have these
28:28 moments in time where you recognize
28:32 the state changes now
28:35 i want you to think about approaching
28:39 sort of uh without getting into any
28:41 specifics let's say you have a tough
28:43 year
28:46 you have a tough year and it just is
28:48 like wow is anything going to go right
28:49 again
28:50 certainly you know it doesn't feel like
28:52 it because you can't you don't know
28:54 when things are going to change but then
28:57 you go back
28:58 to this sort of void that you're lit you
29:01 were living in
29:01 without any um
29:05 limitations of your body and your mind
29:09 you could go anywhere but then there's
29:10 really nothing there
29:12 if you're in this pure soul realm can
29:15 you go to disney
29:16 disneyland not really because
29:19 every single concept that would forge a
29:22 disneyland to exist
29:24 hasn't happened yet and even if it did
29:28 how would you go back to it as a soul
29:30 person
29:32 besides to operate as probably
29:35 the hybrid being which is a
29:39 soul behaving like a human
29:42 in this realm which we call
29:45 a spirit if you think about a toolbox
29:49 a toolbox is a really interesting thing
29:52 because every toolbox
29:54 can be configured completely different
29:57 and how and why
29:58 is it configured differently because you
30:00 have a task at hand
30:03 that the toolbox is geared towards if
30:06 you're an electrician it has a whole
30:08 set of tools to it if you're a
30:10 construction worker a whole separate set
30:12 of tools then you both
30:13 probably have a screwdriver in there
30:14 somewhere one guy is going to have a lot
30:16 of electrical tape and wires and
30:18 clippers and cutters and strippers the
30:20 other is going to have
30:21 nails and hammers the human body
30:25 and any life force that you might end up
30:28 inheriting
30:30 is a toolbox
30:33 they keep saying you know we were homo
30:34 sapien sapien which
30:36 somehow translates to the tool maker
30:39 that we were one of the first beings to
30:42 create a tool i mean it's just a
30:43 romantic thing anthropologists came up
30:45 with
30:46 we see monkeys put sticks inside holes
30:48 and pull out termites and just eat them
30:51 off the sticks so
30:52 we're definitely not the only ones to do
30:54 it dogs do it cats do it i mean
30:56 you know we're seeing internet videos
30:57 now of all kinds of brilliant stuff
30:59 a beaver that creates a dam is a tool
31:01 maker
31:02 they really are we just happen to be the
31:06 most advanced one
31:07 in this realm of existence which is an
31:10 amazing
31:10 thing the more the individuals online
31:14 create these crazy videos and they're
31:15 able to accomplish things that
31:18 we hadn't previously seen anyone do it's
31:21 a fascinating thing
31:22 especially folks that are born with
31:23 disabilities or folks that inherit a
31:25 disability through some sort of accident
31:28 and they don't let it get to them
31:31 they lose a leg so they get an
31:32 artificial leg
31:34 they don't care man they're just like
31:36 don't don't hobble me with your mind man
31:39 i've figured out a way to get around
31:41 this
31:42 imagine the future of a quadriplegic 200
31:45 years ago
31:47 it's pretty much death isn't it but
31:50 today
31:51 man we got all kinds of wheelchairs they
31:54 can control their mouth
31:55 if they weren't able to speak they could
31:57 use their eyeballs on a
31:59 number pad to control where they're
32:01 going they could write a book
32:02 i mean it's fascinating how many
32:06 instruments that we create to assist our
32:10 our bodies when we're impaired now i
32:13 said that
32:14 and this is obviously nothing profound
32:16 it's said in a lot of different
32:17 realms of discussion
32:21 that we at a minimum in my mind
32:25 in this pure soul form would be an
32:27 emotional
32:28 being 100
32:31 but then it begs the question do we feel
32:35 good and bad in that realm and if we
32:38 were to feel
32:38 bad why would we feel bad
32:42 we speak in phonetic languages
32:45 today that's what i'm doing to you right
32:48 now
32:48 sylables within fastest right
32:53 all right but if you're a soul being
32:56 you're pretty much an open book because
32:59 you exude exactly what you are
33:01 as a matter of your existence the
33:04 availability of deception and a lie is
33:07 most likely
33:10 not possible where would you hide
33:12 anything
33:13 you are that open book you do wear your
33:16 emotions on your sleeve
33:18 but there's one emotion that i have a
33:21 personal curiosity about within a soul
33:23 realm
33:25 which is boredom
33:29 if boredom exists in the soul realm
33:33 then that i believe would be the
33:35 catalyzing
33:37 factor for us to create a different form
33:40 of existence
33:41 if it wasn't an inherent property of our
33:44 existence to begin with
33:46 aka a part of the is formula
33:49 in this room we can hide things can't we
33:54 we can hide
33:57 information we can hire objects
34:00 we can put two fingers behind our back
34:02 that's how magic works
34:04 this misdirection and concealment
34:09 so imagine going from a realm where all
34:11 is known
34:12 all is known all the time
34:17 and you sort of have that rick gervais
34:19 movie happen the second you become
34:21 anything matter based because you have
34:24 the invention of a lie probably not a
34:28 lie lie right off the bat
34:30 but imagine for the very first time
34:33 let's just
34:34 simulate this for a split second you and
34:37 i are in the spiritual realm and i
34:38 always know where you
34:39 are and i don't know if there would be
34:42 even a sentiment of i'm here and you're
34:44 there
34:45 we might be able to co-exist we might
34:48 just
34:48 all be water and be a big gelatin
34:50 thought process right
34:53 but we decide to join this
34:56 matter realm whatever this is perception
34:59 or true
35:00 mass versus some sort of soul energy
35:03 because there's still an anomaly in all
35:04 the conversations i've ever had with you
35:07 that i can't give you a particle that
35:10 your soul's made out of
35:12 i can give you a particle that this
35:14 universe is made out of called
35:16 ether but i don't have one on the other
35:18 side
35:20 if it were to have the same properties
35:22 of ether we could probably detect it
35:24 but it would also have a profound visual
35:27 effect
35:28 on the mass that we have here as a soul
35:30 were to swim out of the
35:31 the mind when the body dies you know
35:33 there'd be all kinds of vessel
35:35 movements and the brain would literally
35:36 oscillate as the soul is literally
35:38 pulling out of the tubes of your brain
35:41 maybe that happens that we just haven't
35:43 gotten the camera down there
35:46 but you exist and let's just say we have
35:48 a
35:49 like a video game we've got a sandbox
35:51 where you can play
35:52 just to get oriented with what it's like
35:54 to be alive before this super high
35:56 construct
35:57 construct concept of being human on
35:59 earth
36:00 comes around as an option just think of
36:03 yourself
36:04 as a sort of single-celled being
36:08 and i'm here and you're here and for a
36:10 while we're together
36:11 because we're in some soupy
36:14 substrate but eventually we're just
36:18 you know we're warm we're comfortable
36:20 there's no predators we're just
36:22 literally experimenting with what it's
36:24 like to be alive
36:26 in this form but you wander away from me
36:29 and i've got
36:30 either little tentacles that can sense
36:33 you
36:33 and and kind of tap you oh that's john
36:36 that's mary
36:38 what if i had it and we both had some
36:39 optics which doesn't exist at the
36:42 absolute
36:43 single cell level let's see i'm looking
36:46 at you
36:47 you're looking at me maybe there is a
36:50 third eye still
36:51 no matter how basic the life force is
36:54 there's the third eye that senses you
36:56 but you get you swim far away from me
37:00 we're in this pond and you swim far away
37:04 and i can't see you for a little while
37:05 and for the first time my existence
37:08 there's a mystery i don't even know
37:12 if we would have a word for it or a way
37:14 to process it
37:17 over time because infinity
37:20 tends to resolve all issues you swim
37:23 back to me
37:24 or i swim to you i'm like oh there you
37:27 are
37:28 that was weird and you say what i said
37:31 i lost track of you what do you mean
37:34 yeah i lost track of you too
37:35 wasn't that strange we've been together
37:38 our whole existence in this other realm
37:40 and the second we transposed in the
37:42 physical realm
37:44 i lost you but then i found you
37:47 now let's just continue going down this
37:49 realm as a matter of a thought
37:51 experiment
37:52 we exhaust every single option of this
37:55 video game that we initially jumped into
37:57 which is this weird
37:58 single cell bean that swims in this warm
38:01 primordial goo
38:04 both decided well that was a lot of fun
38:05 but i kind of did everything that can be
38:07 done in that room yeah me too let's hop
38:08 out computer arch you know
38:12 we hop out now we're back in our
38:15 spiritual realm oh
38:16 gosh it feels so good there's mom
38:19 there's dad there's whatever my friends
38:21 and family there's god
38:23 well what would we do we'd write another
38:27 level to the video game wouldn't we
38:29 let's create a whole bunch more stuff
38:31 yeah let's do that right
38:34 and then eventually the irony of the
38:36 whole thing is that
38:37 as this upper construct of human
38:40 life we within because it is an
38:43 echo from our original schematics
38:47 we create something known as a video
38:49 game in this room
38:52 the first video game metaphorically
38:55 would probably be
38:58 a play writing a story
39:01 that doesn't it's not really happening
39:04 whether god regardless if it was true at
39:06 one point
39:06 and then it's passed and we're going to
39:08 reenact it or just a shakespeare play
39:11 that is purely fictional people getting
39:13 on stage and acting out lines and being
39:15 someone that they're not
39:17 but adhering to the confines of a story
39:23 that's really the first video game we
39:25 got on stage and pretended
39:28 and the audience loved it because why
39:31 because that's what we've always done
39:34 to exist for a very very long time
39:38 there's a fantastic episode of star trek
39:40 voyager
39:42 where jane way and the crew are trying
39:44 to get home it's going to be a 79 year
39:46 journey home
39:47 at full warp they stop off at this
39:50 planet
39:51 and they find out this plane actually
39:53 has mega teleportation capabilities they
39:55 could send
39:56 the entire ship home
40:00 but the guy who runs the joint is a very
40:02 swab and debonair guy he falls in love
40:04 with janeway
40:04 and says you know you guys just need to
40:06 stay here you will love it here don't
40:08 you love it here
40:09 she's like yeah i totally love it here
40:11 but you know some of our folks
40:12 are going to want to get home to their
40:14 family so i can't just
40:16 make that vote for them
40:19 and it turns out that this race
40:23 living in this euphoric state for a very
40:26 long time
40:27 has one commodity that they love above
40:29 all commodities
40:31 which is stories stories that have never
40:35 been told
40:36 and the reason why is that they have
40:38 utterly exhausted
40:40 all of the stories that they had written
40:42 and for whatever reason
40:43 can't come up with any new ones they're
40:45 at least convincing
40:47 so they have a policy not to give away
40:49 the technology
40:52 of their warp capabilities and so
40:54 they're at an impasse
40:56 it's either leave without the capability
40:58 of going home with this special
40:59 technology or
41:01 do a deal in the black market with some
41:03 folks on the side who are saying look
41:05 i'll give you the technology
41:07 but you have to give us those stories
41:10 out of your database and through a
41:14 massive conversation and some bending of
41:17 the prime directive
41:20 they decide to do it actually tuvok the
41:23 vulcan
41:25 sort of goes behind janeway's back and
41:27 he goes down and does the swap for the
41:29 engine versus the poetry they get this
41:31 device up
41:33 into the enterprise they start getting
41:36 pursued because they realize this was
41:38 stolen
41:39 illegally and the device actually fries
41:42 because there's a incompatibility in the
41:45 power
41:45 source which would never have worked
41:48 anyway
41:50 that's a very interesting storyline
41:54 that this civilization wanted new
41:56 stories more than anything else
42:00 it sort of goes back to my my other
42:02 episode
42:04 soul time where i said look man there
42:07 obviously are some rules here
42:08 and maybe they're you know it's one of
42:11 these things of are they rules are they
42:12 just inc
42:13 are are they just um perceivable
42:16 restrictions
42:19 as opposed to real restrictions like we
42:22 have romantic stories from the bible
42:24 and other biblical type books
42:28 where a god can do anything god can make
42:31 anything happen
42:33 but maybe within the confines of this
42:36 universe
42:37 he or she can't do anything
42:40 not without maybe sort of like the
42:43 replica
42:44 looking for more life at the terrell
42:45 corporation and dr terrell tells roy
42:48 batty you know we tried everything
42:50 but it turns into a pathogen or a virus
42:52 that kills the
42:54 host we look back at
42:58 the pre-dynastic stuff and like i said
43:00 in those
43:01 two ancient egypt or ancient building
43:05 episodes i put together for you last
43:06 season
43:09 i sat there and said to you you know i
43:11 don't understand how
43:12 a group of super intelligent human
43:16 beings
43:17 regardless if you want to call them
43:18 aliens from a constellation of your
43:20 choice
43:21 would come down and build one a stone
43:24 age society
43:25 meaning all the buildings are built out
43:26 of carved stone no matter how elaborate
43:28 they are
43:29 they don't they're not built of steel
43:32 but they built basalt boxes that are
43:34 amazing but they didn't
43:36 we don't believe that those individuals
43:38 actually wrote anything on the walls
43:40 that the writing that we have seen on
43:42 the boxes was definitely etched recently
43:44 by some
43:45 definite primates and then you have
43:48 painting on the wall that has now been
43:50 proven i believe by brian forrester
43:53 it's a plaster that's been applied to
43:54 the wall and then painted on
43:57 well relief would probably be the way
44:00 that that would be done
44:02 because it was done at a later time in
44:04 that era
44:06 but i couldn't resolve this question of
44:09 hey man
44:10 uh why wouldn't they do that
44:14 because it's hard to imagine you would
44:16 have all this capability but not
44:17 some foresight to record in a history
44:20 book as to who you were
44:22 through paintings or etchings or reliefs
44:26 however if we take this
44:30 story that i've put together for you in
44:31 this episode and that the souls
44:34 are penetrating a fresh new realm in
44:37 this
44:37 reality that we have now the need for
44:40 that sort of communication would almost
44:42 be foreign
44:45 and the reason would be they're all
44:48 telepathic
44:50 why write anything down when we know all
44:52 things you know how about the pyramids
44:54 right joe
44:55 yeah of course i can see your thoughts i
44:57 can see all the history and by the way i
44:58 was there
45:00 it would only be as we lost our third
45:02 eye
45:03 through perhaps the way that the human
45:05 body evolved
45:06 that that direct line of communication
45:09 that esp
45:10 communication starts to disappear
45:13 could be a an election
45:16 an elective i guess we could say an
45:19 elective thing that we said you know
45:20 we're kind of cheating here aren't we
45:22 yeah what do you mean well dude you can
45:24 hear my thoughts right yeah yeah okay
45:26 well what if you couldn't
45:27 what do you mean we've never lived in
45:29 that room before
45:30 let me show you it reaches the side of
45:32 the dude's pineal gland goes ding ding
45:34 ding ding ding
45:35 he reaches into his own now look at that
45:37 oh my god this is really weird
45:39 i can't hear your thoughts yeah but
45:41 don't you feel like you kind of now
45:43 like to spend a day we'll talk in a day
45:45 right and you come back in a day and
45:46 it's like
45:47 what'd you do i don't know what you do i
45:50 don't have to tell you
45:51 you know you don't know everything about
45:52 me anymore i get a little bit of privacy
45:56 isn't that kind of fun to have privacy
45:59 if we were in a realm
46:00 where all is known i have personally no
46:03 opinion
46:04 i bet you wouldn't have much of an
46:06 opinion either because we've never lived
46:07 in the other realm before
46:10 i think one of the misnomers that
46:11 science fiction and star trek is a
46:13 really good
46:14 one the empath from next generation
46:18 there's several episodes where these
46:19 empaths that can hear the people's
46:21 thoughts get to an extended
46:24 interaction where they hear too many
46:25 thoughts and they go nuts they hold
46:27 their head oh my god i can't you know i
46:28 can't hear
46:30 and i think that that only occurs when
46:32 you're not a borg
46:34 which is definitely a dirty word in star
46:36 trek but if we apply the borg hive mind
46:39 mechanism to our previous existence it's
46:42 a very positive
46:44 non-competitive there are no other
46:45 species but us and we all
46:48 sort of sing a song together
46:52 and it's a good song and we're all okay
46:54 with it
46:55 once you cut everything off and make
46:57 everyone go their own way and then you
46:59 give one person
47:01 the capability of hearing all those
47:03 thoughts then you're gonna drive one
47:04 person nuts
47:07 but those ants that are working as one
47:09 amoeba
47:11 in the jungle it's almost
47:15 it's just blatant to me that that's one
47:17 consciousness
47:19 the brood is a conscious
47:22 sort of fourth dimension thing it exists
47:26 in all time around them
47:29 and they're all their little brains
47:31 which are about a cell or two
47:33 are simply like a remote terminal on a
47:37 mainframe
47:39 and even though they hover around the
47:41 queens
47:42 the queens are no more insignificant or
47:45 significant than the warrior bees and
47:47 the worker
47:48 warrior ants and the worker ants
47:50 everything has to coexist and work
47:52 together
47:53 otherwise there is no group of ants
47:57 we obviously wish we were more like
47:59 those ants in a lot of ways so that
48:01 even if we're all mentally impaired we'd
48:04 all be mentally impaired and we wouldn't
48:06 know the difference
48:07 or if we were able to get an a in the
48:09 test everyone gets an a in the test
48:11 now what we do with that knowledge is
48:13 individual and different
48:15 but we're super quarantined aren't we we
48:17 get to do what we want
48:19 now there's been a debate in the world
48:23 which i think applies to a lot of this
48:25 theory and again if you take
48:27 this this modern debate i'm going to
48:29 give you and pull it all the way back to
48:31 the soul realm
48:32 then i think your perspective will
48:34 increase beyond your wildest dreams
48:36 and that is sort of the the theory of
48:41 government and the way that we operate
48:43 on this planet as individuals
48:46 is viewed very beneficial by some folks
48:49 and very blasphemous
48:52 by other folks who believe in a more
48:54 socialistic realm
48:56 where we would be the hive mind ants in
48:59 a socialistic realm
49:01 so if you've ever debated that in your
49:03 mind of like am i a jerk because i
49:05 really like to be my own individual
49:07 i mean seriously i know it's fun and you
49:10 can have all these amazing
49:11 experiences with you and others like you
49:15 meaning not high-minded but you both
49:18 like a particular thing and you like to
49:19 spend your time together
49:21 doing that thing but i think for me
49:25 the answer is the following because
49:28 human beings have no
49:29 conscious openness to each other
49:33 meaning i can't hear your thoughts man i
49:36 might be able to look at your face and
49:37 read you really well based on a
49:39 million other experiences someone else
49:41 has had but we're not
49:43 built to do this at least that we've
49:47 either evolved out of or we have
49:50 involved into
49:51 yet so that for me
49:55 begs the question that
49:59 it seems like we are made to be
50:01 individuals
50:03 have our own experiences harvest our own
50:05 ideas
50:06 have our own epiphanies do our own
50:08 research do our own creation our own art
50:12 which could be anything and then bring
50:15 that together
50:17 with the rest of the world perhaps in
50:20 the spiritual realm
50:22 to compare notes and of course the idea
50:25 would be
50:26 well if we have lived an infinite amount
50:29 of time
50:30 in the previous realm because an is has
50:32 infinity in all directions right
50:34 if you take infinity and divide it in
50:36 half okay that's an absurd concept but
50:39 the other half's infinite and you know
50:41 the right half's infinite left half is
50:42 infinite
50:43 but maybe the game currently right now
50:46 in our existence
50:47 is to go off and do our individual
50:48 explorations to bring back
50:50 a boon of some sort to the hive
50:54 like an ant that goes off and researches
50:57 laying that little chemical trail of i'm
50:59 looking for food
51:01 he finds a dead fly and he's like oh my
51:03 god it's thanksgiving man and he starts
51:05 peeling part of the protein off and he
51:07 starts laying a different
51:09 chemical trail walking back on his old
51:11 chemical trail to get back to the hive
51:13 and then when the new ants smell the
51:15 food trail
51:16 it's game on bring that fly
51:20 we seldom at least in any
51:22 anthropological
51:23 or philosophical writings that i have
51:26 read
51:27 have the balls to go down to
51:30 this
51:33 sort of altered states
51:36 william hurt moment where we're going
51:39 back to
51:40 the very nothingness of our existence
51:43 and then working up from there i
51:46 personally don't believe
51:48 that there is a void in terms of
51:52 anything that is um natural to our
51:55 universe
51:56 we may have as i've said a couple times
52:00 like i had a dream once being in a void
52:02 and it was really
52:04 very interesting and sort of disturbing
52:06 all at the same time
52:07 if we have any sort of penalty box for
52:10 certain bad behaviors which i'm not
52:12 convinced we do
52:14 i've isolate day to day on such a thing
52:17 but it would be something that we might
52:19 do where we
52:20 put you in a place to think about who
52:22 you are and what you've done and we
52:24 simply turn our backs on you
52:26 for a obviously a finite amount of time
52:30 just so that you can re-prioritize your
52:34 your narcissism your greed
52:38 because those are issues that simply
52:41 cannot
52:42 really exist in the spiritual realm
52:44 where all things are even
52:46 and all things are known i think it's
52:49 interesting that most life force
52:52 as far as i know and there's probably a
52:54 few exceptions but like a single cell
52:56 being
52:58 procreating might instantaneously create
53:01 a full
53:02 conscious copy of itself but in most
53:04 higher constructs of life
53:06 there's an incubation period where where
53:10 either in a egg or a womb shaped like an
53:13 egg
53:14 and it gives us
53:17 time to gestate
53:21 into the new life force
53:25 nine months on average for a baby
53:28 is very interesting in a human form
53:30 because it would give us the realm of
53:31 letting
53:32 or give us the ability to let go of our
53:36 purely soul realm and to start getting
53:38 used to being
53:39 in a physical realm not only the
53:42 physical realm
53:42 which would be our growing fetus which
53:45 would be us
53:48 but to get used to being in a liquid
53:52 container and eventually you would be
53:54 bumping into your mother's
53:56 womb the entire time getting you used to
53:59 being
54:00 coddled almost it's no mystery that
54:04 you know we after birth
54:07 we enjoy any simulation of the womb
54:11 for a little while we like being held
54:14 we like what do they know they wrap
54:16 babies up in little cocoons now
54:18 in the maternity wards which gives them
54:21 that little feeling of being still in
54:22 the womb
54:24 i'm sure it's a still a gigantic shock
54:27 to come out of a
54:29 warm liquid that's probably more
54:32 black than anything and then all sudden
54:34 you're using your eyeballs for the first
54:35 time trying to make
54:36 sense of the information thank god for
54:40 genetics and the whole process of
54:42 what we have organized as mass
54:46 becomes a crystalline structure that is
54:49 then handed to
54:50 our babies through just an egg and some
54:53 sperm
54:53 it's an amazing thing it's an absolutely
54:56 phenomenally amazing thing
54:58 what we're always asking today in the
55:01 modern age
55:03 is because the body will
55:07 obviously take on attributes of the
55:08 family
55:10 and it's not proportional right some
55:12 parents don't share any dna
55:14 with their spouse at least on the visual
55:18 cosmetic level on the outside
55:21 but there's preferences for things
55:23 you'll end up acting like your mother or
55:25 your father or your grandmother's your
55:27 grandfather
55:28 somehow there's something that is very
55:30 unique to those individuals and you'll
55:32 have it
55:33 you'll talk a certain way you'll laugh a
55:35 certain way
55:37 families that are very musical tend to
55:39 produce more musical kids
55:41 artistic artistic kids scientific
55:44 scientific kids the more your family
55:45 gets educated prior to procreating
55:51 that dna goes into your child
55:54 you gift them with your hard work
55:57 and i think it's fascinating because
55:59 there's really no way to
56:02 conclusively determine what i'm about to
56:04 say but imagine you
56:06 have children early in life your you and
56:09 your spouse are 18 years old
56:11 which in the modern age is very early to
56:13 have children
56:15 50 years ago not a big deal it was
56:18 intended to be that way
56:20 but at 18 both you and your spouse
56:23 although you come from very
56:24 smart families you have a child
56:28 and then you have a child every five
56:29 years for say another 20 years
56:32 so you have four kids
56:36 but every five years you and your spouse
56:38 are
56:39 very aggressive with your mind
56:41 artistically scientifically
56:43 philosophically
56:46 you're also becoming better parents
56:49 are the children that come after the
56:52 next generation every five years
56:56 are they innately more intelligent
56:59 than the first child that you had
57:02 and this does not borrow the first child
57:04 from being very aggressive person
57:05 and educating themselves but as
57:09 children before they gain that upper
57:12 mobility to do such a thing
57:14 consciously are they a smarter say
57:17 zero through ten being
57:20 i think i told you guys a long time ago
57:24 one side of my family my surname side of
57:26 the family
57:28 uh never really said oh
57:31 so-and-so was smart so sure you would be
57:33 smart
57:34 even though it was sort of you know
57:36 everyone just sort of believed that sort
57:37 of thing
57:38 but my mom's side of the family was very
57:41 very
57:42 fun about not very it's again it's not a
57:46 mean
57:47 serious thing but they would say you
57:49 know we have
57:51 artists and scientists and da da da da
57:53 da in the family so
57:55 you're showing that you've got this
57:57 prowess as a very young man
57:59 of course you do because we've got that
58:01 in our family
58:02 it was always very uplifting fun
58:05 statements it wasn't anything super
58:07 serious no one sent me anything
58:08 okay kid this is what's gonna happen to
58:10 you they just said that
58:11 so here's what i don't know were they
58:15 telling lies
58:15 absolutely not they're telling the truth
58:18 but now i don't know if i'm getting
58:21 the genetics from my family and
58:23 therefore
58:25 a lot of perhaps complex subjects are
58:29 very easy for me to digest
58:31 because it's a real trait i got out of
58:33 brain density
58:34 neuron density passed down by genetics
58:36 or
58:37 if simply being told that on a
58:39 sociological psychological level
58:42 that i believed it and therefore did not
58:44 gain
58:45 the typical anxiety that some people get
58:47 when they study things because i'm
58:49 telling myself this
58:51 folktale sort of wife's tale
58:55 that of course i'm gonna be smart i'm
58:58 gonna i'm gonna be creative and all this
58:59 other stuff and art and music and blah
59:01 blah blah
59:02 because someone told me i could
59:06 i make it a habit i want to have
59:09 conversations with folks for an extended
59:10 period of time
59:12 and they share with me well i'll i'll
59:15 drill in you know
59:16 tell me about your mom talk about your
59:17 dad your brother your sister your aunt
59:18 your uncle
59:19 grandfather whatever your family your
59:21 oldest family member that you're proud
59:23 of like that you maybe just read books
59:25 about
59:26 and when i hear them tell me some pretty
59:28 enchanting stories and almost every
59:30 human being on earth i'm pretty sure
59:32 everyone i've ever talked to
59:34 had something very interesting and you
59:36 know their first
59:37 reply might be a knee-jerk reaction ah
59:39 there's nothing in my family everyone's
59:41 an idiot
59:42 and they think about it for five or ten
59:43 minutes or an hour and they go well you
59:45 know what there's that one
59:47 there's that one great grandmother mine
59:48 that you know i totally saw eye to eye
59:51 with her and
59:52 it just he had you're right you know it
59:54 turns out that what she was interested
59:55 in is what i'm interested in
59:57 maybe there is a connection there they
59:58 always usually find something like that
60:00 i say go for it again there's
60:04 a lot of concrete evidence and my
60:07 personal observations
60:09 that leapfrogging is a very real thing
60:12 in a genetic sense
60:14 that you are like your grandparents more
60:16 than you're like your parents
60:19 and let me know what if that's true for
60:21 you
60:22 even with your own children you know
60:25 i've had
60:27 a bunch of stories told in my own family
60:29 well okay your
60:30 your mom's like her grandmother and your
60:32 dad's like this dude
60:34 your cousin's like your dad and you're
60:36 like you're your uncle and and it's but
60:38 there's just a drastic level of
60:39 compatibility
60:40 between these little associations and
60:42 they're usually one generation away even
60:44 if they're kind of going sideways
60:46 in the uh family tree
60:49 it's like a recessive personality gene
60:51 that pops out
60:53 and you get that wild and crazy guy
60:54 every once in a while
60:56 i find this stuff utterly fascinating
61:00 and i think that for those of you who
61:03 listened to the show for a long time you
61:04 know this
61:06 i like these conversations that
61:10 are sort of talking about the forbidden
61:12 thoughts
61:14 and it's that intelligence threshold
61:16 conversation episode i made which is
61:18 there's
61:19 there are all these thoughts that we
61:20 have that we instinctively feel
61:23 but there seems to be a barrier inside
61:25 of us that goes man i have either no
61:27 data
61:28 to really have that conversation any
61:30 intelligent form
61:31 or i do have some data but it's very
61:34 difficult for me to talk to myself
61:37 to advance the theory any further than
61:39 what my first epiphany was
61:42 i will give you a trick if you want to
61:44 do things totally by yourself
61:46 you don't have your own youtube show and
61:47 that sort of thing get a patent paper
61:50 and start writing down what little tiny
61:53 kernels you have of any
61:54 theory thought whether it be scientific
61:57 artistic psychological whatever
61:59 and you'll be amazed that after seeing
62:01 your first few paragraphs
62:04 you will find the next paragraph and the
62:06 next sentence and the next word
62:09 and you'll start to see yourself using
62:11 words more often
62:13 that are just words you picked to
62:16 describe something that hasn't been
62:17 really labeled
62:18 and so those will become your
62:20 nomenclature your little lookup key
62:22 you know i say this one word to mean
62:24 these things
62:27 you know some of you will remember uh
62:29 two years ago i was telling you about
62:31 this project infinity i was creating
62:33 which was a a project to give us
62:36 a a set of scientific symbols
62:41 that would address pretty much this
62:43 conversation
62:44 such that we could draw formulas for the
62:47 soul
62:48 and then formulas for mass energy both
62:51 being really kind of the same thing but
62:53 we could track them separately so that
62:55 we could have a philosophical
62:57 conversation
62:58 in written form in a symbolic written
63:00 form and then 2020 happens and
63:02 life gets busy trying to survive but we
63:05 put more thought into that
63:07 i got it pretty advanced
63:10 but the problem that i'm trying to
63:14 solve at this point which will be the
63:16 catalyzing moment where this project
63:19 becomes an epiphany for all folks to
63:22 have
63:23 as i'm trying to to formulate some
63:27 equations
63:28 of which we all think about which is one
63:31 of them's in this episode
63:34 did we evolve from the soul energy
63:37 into this mass realm
63:40 and then when we die in the mass room do
63:43 we go back
63:44 to the soul realm and is this a
63:45 reoccurring event because we exist
63:48 forever
63:49 so once i get a decent equation down on
63:51 paper which i haven't tried to do this
63:53 for
63:54 a year and some change now i think we'll
63:57 have something really fun and i'll do an
63:59 episode on it
64:01 uh part of it is when you do something
64:03 like this i'll just tell you
64:06 you'll over engineer what you're trying
64:09 to do
64:10 because you want to make sure that
64:11 everything's accounted for such that if
64:13 that subject matter comes up you have
64:15 symbols for it
64:16 but then you end up through the thought
64:19 of algebra
64:20 you'll simplify your formulas down to
64:23 the point where you're like okay well
64:24 this is a
64:25 duplicate of that and so we no longer
64:27 need it we can say this
64:28 with lesser count of symbols
64:32 and you don't want this thing to be
64:33 super complex because then no one can
64:35 get into it
64:35 i know that probably makes some sense to
64:37 you and i'm seeing everything in my head
64:39 it just just shows you sort of a
64:42 practical application
64:43 of this sort of thinking because you
64:46 don't go to college and have these
64:48 conversations typically i mean there's
64:50 all kinds of wings of philosophy
64:53 existentialism gets into some of this
64:55 kind of conversation
64:56 do you exist are you really a nothing
64:59 that kind of
65:00 sort of academic gymnastics
65:03 i can never tell when i get into some of
65:05 my philosophy books if i'm just reading
65:08 a bunch of blowhards trying to sound
65:11 intelligent
65:12 to other people that haven't had any
65:14 thoughts whatsoever like this or if they
65:16 really were
65:18 pioneering and blazing a trail for the
65:21 human consciousness to go to the next
65:22 level
65:23 i want to believe the latter i'm not
65:25 sure
65:27 but anyway let me know what you think
65:29 this is one that just seemed very very
65:31 interesting to me
65:32 and this really came out of cruising
65:34 through
65:36 philosophy book that i just found that i
65:37 have owned for years and i had
65:40 read just a part of it and i put it down
65:42 like an idiot and then didn't finish it
65:44 and i was just
65:45 tabbing in the middle of it i was like
65:46 oh right it wasn't about this but it was
65:49 definitely kicking off
65:51 sort of as i was rejecting what i was
65:52 reading this is sort of the
65:54 the platform that came to mind but
65:57 anyway
