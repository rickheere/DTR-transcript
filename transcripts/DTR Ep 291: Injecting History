00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen I came out here on this patio
00:39 last night about 1:40 a.m. got recording
00:44 by two got forty minutes into a cool
00:47 episode and the computer restarted never
00:52 had that happened before and for
00:55 whatever reason the temp file was erased
00:57 so I have now completely figured out how
00:59 to recover that even if it can't do it
01:04 but I lost the audio because when I
01:06 rebooted the software it screwed it up
01:08 and erased the original soundtrack
01:11 there's some brilliant reason but this
01:16 episode is about
01:19 it's almost as heavy as the Mendell
01:22 effect in my opinion I'm calling it
01:26 injecting history and it goes like this
01:30 you know I've beat around the bush
01:32 because I couldn't figure out how to put
01:33 this into words myself initially but now
01:36 we're here and I think I can do it on
01:38 point so a small portion of the world
01:41 believes that the mendel effect is real
01:44 I'm gonna get into why I think certain
01:48 events are Mandela effects and other
01:50 events aren't because the big question I
01:52 keep hearing people say is why this you
01:55 know why Star Wars why the Builder bears
02:00 or whatever the hell you call them
02:03 Berenstein embarrasses sorry the pillar
02:06 bears always you build them all the
02:08 Berenstein barons die and whatever
02:11 Berenstain well we aren't asking is the
02:15 overall I shouldn't say we aren't asking
02:18 but we're not really deeply exploring
02:21 why the Mandela effect would occur when
02:26 it first debuted the immediately blamed
02:28 the CERN Hadron Collider and saying that
02:32 the high acceleration impacts coincided
02:37 with people misunderstanding when Nelson
02:39 Mandela died there's also the gentleman
02:42 who was in a video I think long after
02:47 the Mandela effect had been rumored to
02:49 exist wearing a Mandela sign on his
02:52 chest and what's interesting about that
02:55 whole thing is you have a theory debuted
02:57 in a cause already in place that stunts
03:01 the brain doesn't it would you hear
03:04 about this no I didn't about that well
03:05 it's this and it's because of that oh
03:06 okay I'm done over but what would have
03:10 happened had someone been able to
03:12 reasonably suggest that the Mandela
03:14 effect was occurring but not give you an
03:16 answer the vibe I'm getting is that is
03:19 extremely organic if it occurs at all
03:23 the only other explanation of it not
03:26 being real is that we have this
03:30 interesting effect that occurs when we
03:32 try to pre-internet pass information
03:34 around through printed press we would
03:38 screw it up regionally I think that
03:41 there's enough Medel effects now that
03:45 you sort of have I think a few smoking
03:49 guns that are a little tough to digest
03:51 but this episode is about injecting
03:54 histories what the hell does that mean
03:56 let me ask you this when we study the
04:01 JFK assassination from we were when we
04:04 were a kid and believe me I understand
04:06 that retort on this and let me go both
04:08 sides of the game the biggest conspiracy
04:11 was a grassy knoll shot and if there was
04:14 someone the grassy grassy knoll in this
04:17 world today in 2018 they're not the
04:19 person who took the shot but what's
04:22 interesting is is there seems to be this
04:24 slow ebb of new information it keeps
04:29 coming out about the JFK assassination
04:32 almost as if the more we peer at it and
04:35 into it and go down that rabbit hole
04:39 it's a fractal of new information
04:42 meaning it is infinite in its reveal of
04:46 information to us there doesn't seem to
04:48 be any conclusive moment when it's like
04:50 okay we got it when I was a kid there
04:54 was no deaf guy I loved the train tracks
04:58 who watched the 18 year old kid come out
05:01 of a weird little hole there were no CIA
05:05 guys jumping off of the cars dressed
05:06 like hobos with earpieces there was no
05:10 kid in the rain drain the windshield
05:11 didn't get hit the windshield rim didn't
05:12 get hit the curb didn't get hit yes
05:16 there were six seats and the one that I
05:17 remember the driver didn't turn around
05:22 to make sure the shot happened where the
05:26 guy in the passenger seat grabs a string
05:28 there wasn't the missing footage of the
05:31 car stopping for 11 seconds to make sure
05:35 the shot took place there wasn't the
05:38 Cuban guy with the black umbrella I
05:40 could go on for [ __ ] days and the
05:44 more you look into it the more you look
05:45 into it there's always something else
05:46 always something else now some of you
05:48 could say look that's disinfo or yeah
05:51 that's what happens when you start
05:52 investigating something it just keeps
05:54 revealing like onion layers but what's
05:57 interesting is is there's a correlation
05:59 between the following things JFK
06:04 assassination
06:06 the line in star wars Empire Strikes
06:08 Back 1980 Luke I'm your father or no I'm
06:13 your father
06:14 the Berenstein bears Sally fields giving
06:18 a speech there is a correlation between
06:22 those events and it's the following
06:28 those events affected Society / reality
06:35 more than most events in the world
06:38 now the Berenstein bears you've got a
06:41 series of books that touch the hearts of
06:43 children children are psychic amazing at
06:47 but the children and then you're playing
06:48 with their brains and then you say it
06:50 was one way versus the other way each
06:51 time that franchise was pulled off the
06:54 shelf when the book cover went in front
06:56 of the face of a child they had a
06:59 feeling a wonderful positive feeling
07:03 maybe Berenstain Bernstein Bernstein
07:07 whatever it might just be let's just
07:13 open your mind a little bit the each one
07:17 of us have our own history for some
07:22 events there are our history right my
07:26 childhood was my childhood not your
07:28 childhood and vice versa so if we don't
07:31 remember the same childhood of course
07:33 makes mathematical sense makes
07:35 historical sense but almost everyone in
07:38 the world with access to a movie theater
07:41 1988 and saw Empire Strikes Back so now
07:46 what do we have nearly the entire plan
07:49 heard that JFK was assassinated Nelson
07:53 Mandela was a global character and when
07:56 he died it was a global piece of
07:59 information now imagine you have each
08:04 individual human sustaining their own
08:09 reality their own perspective their own
08:11 reality distortion field
08:14 each individual has a level of frequency
08:19 that they're willing to share with the
08:20 rest of reality based on the
08:24 individualism they have their own
08:26 frequency as well the higher individual
08:29 frequency they have the less they are
08:31 influenced by outside frequencies or
08:34 vice versa they have very little
08:38 individualism and so they just grab the
08:42 tail in front of them and hang on for
08:45 dear life you will always find the
08:48 people that go with the flow and I don't
08:50 mean go with the flow in life but go
08:52 with trends and whatever is on TV and
08:55 whatever foods popular or whatever
08:57 clothing brands spot really you will
09:00 find unequivocally I'm just gonna tell
09:04 you it's not a [ __ ] maybe you will
09:07 find a shallow human being I don't mean
09:11 bad human being
09:12 I just mean shallow extremely
09:15 impressionable you could lie to them
09:17 about anything and they all go oh really
09:20 you know the next statement is I like
09:23 chewing gum you know this is what we're
09:26 dealing with as a fabric of society but
09:32 those that take control of their own
09:33 mind which is a muscle right it's just
09:35 like a muscle atrophies you can start
09:37 giving up in reality and go with the
09:39 flow and you can say oh my god I hate
09:40 this what am i did that forward you pull
09:42 back into your own reality now now
09:45 imagine you take all these different
09:46 people with their different levels of
09:48 individual individualism and outward
09:52 social sharing hivemind nature and you
09:55 draw them to a single point in time Luke
09:58 I'm your father no I am your father the
10:03 whole world sees that now
10:07 I gave you to two types of people
10:14 someone whose individual and someone
10:16 who's a hive mind er slash tail grabber
10:19 can't think for themselves there's an
10:23 interesting phenomenon that went around
10:25 and if you guys I'll try to Lincoln in
10:26 the bottom it's utterly fascinating okay
10:30 there's this weird sound that happens
10:34 and you either hear the word yanny Y a
10:38 in NY or Lauren those two don't even
10:44 rhyme and ago they're rare you know
10:48 it'll give that sing and then it changes
10:50 the pitch and we were sitting in a room
10:52 my smoke lounge and the guy owns a place
10:54 he goes I see I hear Lauren Lauren now
10:56 I'm so here Annie Annie loud and clear
10:59 and then it goes down also died here
11:02 Lauren I'm like god damn like that's
11:03 just crazy right what is fascinating
11:07 about the Mendell effect
11:09 okay is it's always a binary effect
11:13 you either remember it this way or you
11:15 remember it that way there's never a
11:17 third person that goes you know Darth
11:22 Vader actually never said [ __ ] I'm
11:24 you're dead [ __ ] you know it's
11:25 like you don't hear that right it's
11:27 there's no third there's just two how is
11:30 that possible there's a foul-up in
11:33 history is it always a binary follow-up
11:35 well you know now at the part of the
11:37 world we taught that Eli Whitney's a
11:40 white guy the other half I said it's
11:42 black it was a social experiment just to
11:43 see what happened what would happen
11:46 especially in the Senate the internet
11:48 thing comes around it's gonna be
11:50 hilarious to see them fight over it you
11:54 know the person returns the other one
11:55 goes well they do they know who Mandela
11:56 still life so what would cause the
11:59 binary effect to happen I'm not sure
12:04 let's talk about injecting history now
12:08 we know in history in history the
12:12 revisionists inject history all the time
12:14 that's not exactly what I'm talking
12:16 about maybe some of you thought I was
12:17 going there and thought about that where
12:19 they revise history they put things in
12:21 the past that didn't exist like
12:23 dinosaurs potentially right again to
12:26 review the dinosaur theory very quickly
12:29 the first 40 years of dinosaur
12:31 exploration paleontology the two leading
12:37 gentlemen who came up with all the
12:39 discoveries were discovered to be
12:40 charlatans and had lied the entire time
12:44 they were digging things out of the
12:45 ground then the subsequent 100 years 150
12:52 years after they got done not quite 150
12:54 years but all the things that were dug
12:56 out of ground still look like they're
12:57 fake charlatan crap that is a scam okay
13:03 you can't make up what aliens look like
13:05 and all of a sudden they show up and
13:06 like exactly like the way you made them
13:08 when you actually intentionally made
13:10 them wrong
13:10 you can't fake Bigfoot and then all of a
13:14 sudden he shows up and looks exactly
13:15 like the furry costume you got out of
13:17 the Halloween store it doesn't work like
13:19 that and that's the story of dinosaurs
13:22 but now imagine if you could convince
13:24 reality slash all the people that you
13:27 have access to
13:30 overwhelmingly the dinosaurs existed and
13:32 the circular logic problem of time is
13:36 that you made up a story you use
13:39 propaganda television movies printed
13:43 paper to tell kids that they existed and
13:46 then they manifested it into their
13:47 reality such that now you could
13:49 potentially dig up a dinosaur and what
13:51 do they look like they look like the
13:52 fakes that were initially created in the
13:54 1800s because that's how the theory
13:57 started in the first place right it's a
14:00 logic loop you're taking fakeness making
14:02 it real through belief and then it
14:04 actually inserts it in the past and
14:05 because some people are sitting around
14:07 you know breathing through their mouths
14:10 they believe it - and then the dinosaurs
14:13 are real in their world man I don't even
14:14 believe in those things right but what
14:17 is feature in past if you're like me and
14:19 you don't really think time exists it's
14:20 merely an illusion created by the
14:22 storage of history right well if you
14:25 think about us being the vibrational
14:27 waves of ether winds there's only one
14:30 particle type in the entire universe
14:31 it's called ether and either it's a
14:34 vibrating ripple of transverse energy or
14:37 it is a dielectric ricochet or an
14:41 orbital magnetism wave we're here now
14:47 the same stuff somehow history has to be
14:50 stored somewhere physically in the
14:52 universe it does it cannot have a zero
14:55 mass situation even if the container is
14:58 infinite there's a instance of infinity
15:00 that you must account for
15:05 I'm starting to see time the illusion in
15:08 the theory of time as a cloud sphere
15:11 around our bodies around our souls
15:15 anywhere you're pointing your
15:17 consciousness your view frustum of your
15:19 eyes is the future what is behind you is
15:25 a collection of states that you've
15:27 already had you've moved through them in
15:30 a linear forward fashion in paradigm in
15:34 your mind ok how many have ever gone
15:40 your hard drive and opened up an old
15:41 word document and modified it and hit
15:43 saved and you felt kind of weird you
15:45 were like I gotta just change something
15:46 that was really really old I changed an
15:49 old letter I wrote my mother 12 years
15:51 ago like why would you do that you know
15:52 you did those are pristine documents
15:54 that you wrote that were your term
15:57 papers your award-winning article at
15:59 work got that done right but you can do
16:05 it can't you and I'm suggesting that
16:09 that's exactly what happens is that we
16:14 can actually just go back to the hard
16:17 drive of our perceived past right again
16:21 if the past isn't written in stone just
16:23 like the future isn't written in stone
16:25 holy [ __ ] we can rewrite anything a
16:30 second ago a millennia ago the beginning
16:35 of time itself of our existence because
16:38 there isn't really such a thing we're
16:40 always trying to solve for the is right
16:44 how could we be in is hmm you just are
16:48 that's it you just are the is okay
16:53 sounds funny doesn't it the Mandela fact
16:57 if it exists may simply be an organic
17:03 frequency of my episode which is
17:09 consensus reality right we concede that
17:14 reality is the way we currently have a
17:16 group understood it the reason why like
17:19 in my mind over matter Posada just
17:21 released the reason why a crazy person
17:23 can't change the universe and why
17:24 someone can't fly is because the
17:27 majority of us believe it either went a
17:30 particular way and you're not allowed to
17:31 change it or we don't think it's
17:36 possible can you imagine if the rule of
17:41 the rules of physics in this universe
17:44 was merely a consensus of us that we
17:47 discover mathematics as almost an
17:51 imperative to explain the unexplainable
17:54 you know when they would say the earth
17:57 is on the back of a turtle well maybe
18:00 back in the day when they believed the
18:02 earth was on a back of a turtle it was
18:03 on the back of a turtle when they
18:06 believed the world was flat it was flat
18:09 he believed it was round it was round
18:12 center of the universe no sign of the
18:13 universe expanding now the idea is okay
18:18 are there facts about the universe that
18:22 are locked and even though man doesn't
18:25 understand it they're still locked and I
18:29 would say yes but I'm not convinced
18:32 we're really changing things just yet or
18:34 that we ever have I'll give you an
18:38 example for me that's pretty interesting
18:41 I cannot stop thinking about my episode
18:44 I did on do craters exist I'm the only
18:46 dude on Planet [ __ ] Earth I know of
18:48 that his poet posed this theory quite
18:52 bluntly that I think they're volcanic
18:54 eruptions now the one thing I had heard
18:58 before I made my episode was that
18:59 someone said that the the moon might
19:02 simply be an expired Sun I love that
19:07 idea love it love it love it when I did
19:11 the interview with bart sibrel and i
19:15 found those photographs to overlay on
19:16 top of the interview and I finally found
19:19 the photograph of the center of a
19:21 volcano that has a spout down the center
19:24 it's even kind of like a almost looks
19:27 like a birdbath it's kind of made a
19:29 little thing as it kind of slowly comes
19:31 out and now it was spinning some of that
19:33 debris out on the inner dish of the
19:38 actual impression which looks like a
19:39 crater okay and then I showed the
19:42 picture on the moon with the crater that
19:44 was glowing in the center and you can
19:45 see the spills of lava or plasma energy
19:49 or whatever it is is the season pure
19:51 white on the inside of the crater it's a
19:56 volcanic eruption crater and if the
20:00 whole surface of the Moon was boiling at
20:04 some point that would mean it might have
20:06 been a Sun which really does call into
20:10 all the other theories about what shape
20:12 the world is and all that good stuff
20:13 right so I believe for me personally it
20:19 was either created out of a remedial
20:23 understanding of meteorites and how they
20:26 slam into the surface of sphere z' you
20:30 know our our moons vector is insane it
20:35 has its own rotation it's going around
20:37 the
20:39 earth the earth is going around the Sun
20:41 let's just say you take all the official
20:43 stories right and here comes this thing
20:46 from outer space I don't know you can't
20:50 throw a curve ball that would spin in so
20:53 many directions you couldn't and so
20:57 there's nothing is gonna hit the moon
21:00 perpendicular to the surface right and
21:04 some point of rocks can hit tangent to
21:06 the curve and it's gonna take a big
21:09 elliptical slice out of that surface and
21:12 it's never happened it's never happened
21:13 on earth and it's never happened on the
21:15 moon therefore meteorites hitting
21:18 surfaces may be complete [ __ ]
21:20 [ __ ] and anyone selling fear of that
21:26 nature is either ignorant or one of them
21:32 same goes for solar flares people but
21:36 injecting history when the secret came
21:39 out shortly after the movie what the
21:41 bleep do we know came out it was
21:45 fascinating because the what the bleep
21:48 do we know and that's actually a movie
21:49 title
21:54 how dare them you know risk saying a
21:56 dirty word what the bleep do we know is
21:59 a quantum physics version of the secret
22:04 the only person they put in that movie
22:06 which I wish they hadn't is this woman
22:08 whose title is Chandler okay
22:13 they absolutely took a [ __ ] on the
22:15 credibility of the film by putting her
22:16 in there but there are neurobiologists
22:19 in their quantum physicists in there I
22:21 mean it's it's insane
22:22 it's really beautiful and they explain
22:24 it on a scientific level the secret it's
22:28 much more consumer-oriented same exact
22:31 theory the more that you believe
22:33 something it can come true and all forms
22:38 of reality including how you program
22:40 your body to be in shape even though
22:43 you're not exercising you can do it your
22:45 neuro peptides will absolutely build
22:46 Arnold Schwarzenegger's body as long as
22:48 you believe it I met a guy in Laguna
22:50 that was pop I never worked out but I'm
22:55 telling you this his muscles were so
22:56 huge he had three sons too and they just
23:02 spent their entire life going to school
23:04 and going to the beach he's got never
23:05 worked out he could paint with both of
23:09 his hands at the same time and write two
23:11 different sentences at the same time you
23:13 think about that it's one thing to write
23:15 with both hands but some thing to have
23:16 two levels of consciousness to write two
23:19 sentences saying the different thing at
23:20 the same time crazy so you can deal this
23:23 kind of stuff but one thing that the
23:24 secret said and their marketing material
23:27 which I thought was brilliant and when I
23:28 heard it it was sort of gimmicky is like
23:30 oh yeah whatever but no no I'm thinking
23:33 about a little bit more and they
23:34 essentially said the most powerful rich
23:36 people in the world know this is true
23:38 and they've been trying to keep this
23:41 information keep the secret from you
23:43 that this is the way the universe works
23:44 and it was that you can dial in your own
23:48 reality well if time is an illusion
23:54 and what's important about time being an
23:57 illusion versus a reality is the
24:00 paradigm of how time functions not the
24:02 fact that you don't have awareness of
24:04 time
24:06 okay so it'd be kind of like it's
24:10 somewhat somewhat like saying the
24:12 racetrack is in an illusion and you're
24:14 like what the [ __ ] you talking about
24:15 okay you haven't you think you got in
24:17 that race car and you drove right yeah
24:19 of course I did it I went and saw
24:20 different parts of the track I was at
24:22 lap one than lap two and then 50 laps
24:24 later I won the whatever Indy 500 and I
24:28 say you know what let me show you how
24:30 this works I take you into a room that's
24:32 a virtual reality room where you sit
24:34 inside of a simulator and I turn it on
24:37 and there's a display around you
24:42 the sounds there the smells there the
24:45 car shakes and turns and gives you the
24:47 feeling of with this helmet on you
24:48 that's really tiny and lightweight it's
24:50 a you know 16 K monitor the talks to
24:53 your talks to the rods and cones in your
24:56 eye and all of a sudden you're in
24:58 brainstorm 1981 and you're like oh my
25:00 god this was an illusion I said you see
25:02 it's not that you're not racing in a
25:05 racecar track in your brain it's just
25:07 it's not actually physically taking you
25:09 around the world and that is your
25:11 analogy for time time is a stationary
25:13 thing that is a simulation around you
25:16 not an actual physical location that you
25:19 travel to you've never moved since you
25:21 were born
25:22 you're a node in a circuit you don't
25:26 need to feel bad about that you need to
25:27 enjoy life right so what's strange is is
25:31 that we have all the faith in the world
25:32 as human beings that we can control the
25:35 future you know and forget the secret
25:38 but we can work hard and get a better
25:40 job we can take care of our body and get
25:42 healthier you know pop up above but we
25:44 don't think we can go backwards because
25:47 we think the past is written in stone
25:50 hmm what's interesting for me he's
25:54 studying the studying Egyptology is that
25:57 it would seem and this is you know
26:00 there's very rational reasons why this
26:02 could be occurring I don't mean to be an
26:03 idiot but
26:06 there were a recent discovery to mankind
26:10 do you realize that you know they were
26:13 still digging up Egypt in the 1790s when
26:17 Napoleon's guy discovers the Rosetta
26:19 Stone we don't really understand
26:22 hieroglyphs as translated from heretic
26:24 in Hebrew and then we figured out its
26:27 phonetic language not an iconic language
26:29 and then we start figuring out put in
26:31 air quotes how they work then we start
26:34 digging out the pyramids and the Sphinx
26:36 and as we theorize what these things
26:40 were it would seem that in some cases we
26:44 would go belly-up you know like the
26:46 pyramids being a tomb it's not enough
26:50 they're not a tomb well then what were
26:53 they oh we think they're a battery
26:56 supply
26:56 well now what if when we theorized about
26:58 what the pyramids were we said they were
27:00 tuned because we found some big
27:02 sarcophagi in the center of one of them
27:05 thinking that was a tomb for a human
27:07 being it could have been we forgot that
27:10 you would need special lighting to get
27:12 in there torches and so we forgot to
27:15 stain the walls and our brains with
27:16 torches and so now we realize oh my god
27:19 there's no way they could have lived in
27:20 those things because they would have had
27:22 to have burned torches and the walls
27:23 would have been scorched and on us so
27:25 then we re-engineer the theory that
27:26 they're their batteries this year I'm
27:29 going 3200 BC sounds like a long time
27:33 ago in the 1790s but now when we look at
27:37 overall history of the world 3200 BC is
27:40 yesterday and those buildings don't seem
27:44 modern enough to be in 3200 BC it seems
27:47 like they they're older so our brain
27:49 takes it back to 39,000 BC and recent
27:53 discoveries just keeps going and going
27:56 it's like the history of the past is
27:59 just as innovative and reinventing as
28:05 the present and the future where you
28:09 would expect Apple to come up with the
28:10 new device to play music right
28:13 this is where paradigms become
28:14 bone-crushing ly important
28:17 if you lock your mind or let others tell
28:20 you how things work all the [ __ ] time
28:23 then you will never have a thought for
28:25 yourself you'll become a serf to
28:27 absolute utter ignorance and
28:30 indoctrination however in their defense
28:32 maybe it doesn't matter maybe I'm just
28:36 an artist like you and we're all
28:38 painting this canvas of time we're
28:40 painting it little over here two seconds
28:42 ago two seconds in the future or
28:44 painting it three thousand years in the
28:46 past 50 years and thousand years in the
28:48 past you know so it's a subjective way I
28:55 can participate if you want you can be
28:56 an artist of time if you want a time
28:58 mold or you can just sit here and live
29:02 and enjoy the now sit on that porch and
29:05 Kansas sit there on the edge of the dock
29:08 fishing having a conversation about
29:11 nothing or everything the Internet has
29:15 been an amazing amazing experiment and
29:19 that it is almost as if the entire world
29:22 has been invited to a party line and for
29:27 those of you don't know what that is
29:28 you're younger I've only experienced a
29:31 party line once in my life which is the
29:33 following when the telephone companies
29:36 were trying to distribute television
29:37 telephones to everyone's house they
29:41 didn't really have the switch technology
29:43 to give each individual house in rural
29:47 America their own telephone number
29:50 that's their own line you know so you
29:55 had a party line and party lines were
29:57 you know I think it must have been about
30:00 20 houses on one line at one point when
30:03 I was a kid
30:05 and I think we all had our own phones
30:06 but it was you get this party line as
30:09 well in your house it was strange you
30:10 could pick up the phone and there's a
30:11 whole whole neighborhood's on that phone
30:13 and you just have to be kind like a good
30:16 Skype call where you have a party line
30:18 that when you have like more than two
30:20 people talking on the line at the one
30:22 time you know just take turns talking
30:26 that's a party line and the internet has
30:29 been the ultimate party line all the
30:31 discussions in the YouTube channel on
30:33 YouTube for this channel well you're all
30:36 high for mining together the more you
30:37 get into the comments and read them and
30:40 some of the some of the videos I do you
30:42 guys just go nuts it's awesome like I'll
30:44 come back and there's a hundred and
30:46 fifty comments on a video for me that's
30:49 huge absolutely huge like 10,000 views
30:52 150 comments that's over 1% of everyone
30:56 who watched the movie comic that's
30:57 pretty cool you know what's interesting
30:59 about man and one of the principal
31:02 designs of paradigms is that the man you
31:08 know however we got here there was it's
31:11 safe to say that we had no control at
31:13 one point or perceived lack of control
31:16 or very little control of ourselves and
31:18 the more we become modern air quotes we
31:23 gain control and so most of the
31:27 paradigms that we believe are that said
31:30 we believe quote unquote are based on
31:34 Parab principles of control Josh sent a
31:40 really strange we want time to be
31:43 controlled we want our lives to be
31:45 controlled our careers to be controlled
31:47 our health to be controlled everything's
31:48 control control control because that
31:49 shows superiority a lot of the movie
31:53 arcs that are out there are superhero or
31:56 I should say bad guys antagonists that
31:59 are gonna control the universe right the
32:04 [ __ ] that we allow to run the world
32:06 absolute moronic politicians run by
32:10 moronic bankers sociopathic elite
32:13 families of the world
32:15 in their own little brain it's all about
32:19 control control control let me give you
32:22 an idea of how powerful the notion of
32:26 history is okay there's two types of
32:31 histories if I said to you titus flavius
32:36 of rome had red hair there is next to
32:42 nothing I could do to ever prove that to
32:44 you
32:45 you would either have to believe me or
32:47 not believe me the physical proof would
32:51 be well somehow he was mummified by
32:54 Egyptian folks and there's a hair
32:56 follicles lying around somewhere and we
32:59 could test it for pigment and oh yep he
33:02 was Scottish and he was a dwarf I don't
33:07 know I mean there's something he was he
33:08 was red hair and then you could perhaps
33:11 add some principal discovery to it
33:13 that's what anthropologists do trying to
33:16 figure out what's going on right what
33:18 has gone on but there's plenty of tales
33:21 that we pass around all the time about
33:23 people that existed that did that never
33:25 existed one of the most famous people in
33:30 world history never existed ever he
33:38 never existed
33:41 isn't that amazing we have a bunch of
33:45 people academics is hilarious who go
33:51 around saying that this person existed
33:53 but he never ever existed not ever
33:58 and we have injected him into our past
34:03 we not only injected him into our past
34:06 but we injected him in a way that he has
34:08 ultimate authority over the entire
34:09 [ __ ] universe but he never ever
34:15 existed and neither did two other dudes
34:20 who are part of the same story it did
34:23 amazing things they never existed either
34:26 not ever there are myths and I'm not
34:31 saying they're bad myths where they've
34:33 been they've been used anytime you
34:34 create a knife for instance you've
34:37 created an amazing invention takes no
34:39 ammunition a [ __ ] can use it as lethal
34:42 it's also useful but it depends on how
34:46 you use the knife as to whether or not
34:48 is perceived as a negative object or
34:50 positive object but as soon as the
34:52 object has power to accomplish something
34:54 that no other object can accomplish you
34:57 can take it evil or good isn't that an
34:59 interesting principle and so you can
35:02 take a myth and turn them positive and
35:05 you could take a myth and turn them
35:08 negative you can fight Crusades and kill
35:10 innocent people and the name of a
35:12 [ __ ] myth you can still kill
35:15 countries all over the world in the name
35:18 of myths and their myths fight your
35:21 myths so we see this happen all the time
35:25 we inject fiction into our past to sort
35:28 of rewrite either what is missing from
35:31 our past or to cover up the boring past
35:38 or a shitty past you know we faked why
35:45 shouldn't say we the moon missions were
35:48 faked they were sorry sorry sorry if
35:52 your butt puckers up when you hear that
35:54 it was faked it's not your fault
35:56 it's not my fault I didn't do it you
35:58 didn't do it but they were faked
36:00 but the interesting byproduct of faking
36:03 that was that they inspired a bunch of
36:05 us kids to get into science I think that
36:09 if they hadn't faked the moon missions
36:10 my knowledge of all all areas of physics
36:16 and perhaps electronics and perhaps even
36:18 computers would have never materialized
36:22 in fact the people that invented the
36:24 equipment that I used maybe the
36:27 equipment wondered wouldn't have been
36:29 made so the myth of going to the moon is
36:33 extremely powerful extremely powerful
36:37 so perhaps injecting things in our past
36:41 much more than just a myth but in
36:44 physical reality
36:45 maybe that's important for our
36:47 development we know that our paradigms
36:52 today offer us the growth factor of what
36:58 we call the future this is the famous
37:01 line you don't know where you're going
37:03 if you don't know where you've been
37:06 it's almost like a linear version a
37:10 two-dimensional version of the famous
37:13 statement as it is above so - it is a
37:15 below
37:17 we'll future is just as malleable as the
37:21 past then both have an equal impact on
37:24 our character and both would be equally
37:28 important to our character we don't have
37:34 eyes in the back of our heads at least I
37:37 don't
37:37 and so I perceive where I'm walking is
37:41 sort of more of the future and what's
37:44 behind my head is a metaphor for where
37:46 I've been even if I walk in a circle
37:48 where I was just in where I was just
37:51 then right where I'm going where I'm
37:52 going the Mandela effect that I
37:55 mentioned at the beginning of the
37:56 episode seems like again if it if it's
37:59 caused does anything other than the CERN
38:01 Hadron Collider okay it's an organic
38:03 occurrence it's either I its either
38:06 organic in the sorting out of history
38:10 that has been poorly taught around the
38:12 world or it is truly being molded and
38:19 grown in a petri dish as we consent to a
38:26 particular image of history when I think
38:32 of this stuff I don't know about you but
38:36 it is massively liberating for me
38:39 personally to let go of paradigms that
38:45 seem to have frustrated my existence
38:51 since I gained sentient control over
38:55 this vessel and to be free of it is
39:00 phenomenal I can move in all directions
39:03 now in time I can look at history in a
39:08 completely different way now when I
39:12 first recorded this last night one of
39:14 the things I said was that we want proof
39:19 I said this in the mind over matter
39:21 episode two but we want proof
39:24 that this isn't all just a bunch of
39:26 hunches right
39:28 you could probably define a fairly
39:30 insane mind by saying that the only
39:33 thing that a person if a person was just
39:37 full of hunches and never was able to
39:39 take it over the barrier into
39:41 confirmation under some bias of course
39:46 of realization then you might go insane
39:50 because you're just like it's all just
39:52 unconformity with our loop of curiosity
40:02 look at the Big Bang Theory this is a
40:05 very interesting sociological experiment
40:07 you can do on the scientists that have
40:10 held on to this ridiculous theory but at
40:15 least as defined is a complete it's just
40:19 hilarious how bad this theory is but
40:21 they're sitting around and you know
40:25 Cambridge University you know blowing
40:31 the dust off his old theory which had
40:32 been around for a while and they
40:35 consider running talk Ollie won they
40:38 could have sat around for one decade
40:40 meeting 12 hours a day seven days a week
40:45 even 16 hours a day and sleeping heat
40:48 right it could have done that and no
40:50 point in their journey are they ever
40:52 going to find the utter proof of the Big
40:54 Bang they certainly can't witness it
40:56 because in their theory it was before
40:58 all things were created in the universe
41:00 right so at some point someone the room
41:04 said [ __ ] it let's just tell everyone
41:08 had happened and we'll use the the media
41:11 the movies television books
41:15 I mean hey we have our own publishing
41:18 company at Cambridge University we get
41:21 Isaac [ __ ] Newton in here and now
41:23 they got this young kid with Lou
41:24 Gehrig's disease Stephen W Hawking he's
41:27 so bright and he's so innocent so
41:29 wonderful people are gonna believe him
41:31 and he wants to believe it and so let's
41:33 just say it happened and let's just see
41:35 what happens and then they go okay and
41:37 then kaboom Neil deGrasse Tyson is born
41:42 packed to the brim with [ __ ] we see
41:48 this happen all the time the true danger
41:52 of that process is if they just closed
41:55 the minds of every kid who would have
41:59 otherwise found perhaps where we did
42:01 come from how the mass did get
42:04 distributed in this big seemingly
42:06 infinite container won't even look
42:09 anymore you know and you can't bring up
42:11 string theory sometimes because the Big
42:14 Bang doesn't like the string theory well
42:18 if the guy forgot it was like dr. Greene
42:20 or so I can't really guys name but if
42:23 that poor guy who came up with a string
42:25 theory has to sit around and kiss the
42:27 ass of all the ignorant tenured
42:30 professors haven't done a lick a [ __ ]
42:33 research in their lives the only
42:34 intellectual thing they ever did was
42:36 write their doctors thesis the PhD
42:40 thesis and then they taught out a books
42:41 their whole life and they write a paper
42:43 of a bunch of blather and crap everyone
42:45 some lada trying to suck some money into
42:47 the into the university but they're not
42:50 really innovative innovating anything
42:52 they're not out there doing scientific
42:54 experiments confirming anything they
42:57 take the check they go home and they
42:58 shut
42:59 they make sure electricity cost a [ __ ]
43:01 ton of money zero-point energy projects
43:03 are never greenlit we went to the moon
43:04 etc etc well when Christianity came
43:07 around and everyone who lived through
43:09 that time said what are you talking
43:13 about Jesus we lived in Rome right when
43:16 you said this guy existed he didn't
43:18 exist what wasn't any big crucifying
43:20 moment where some dude was up there and
43:22 then he was pulled down and resurrected
43:24 we were there what that cave over there
43:27 that's my uncle's cave he used to keep
43:29 his beer in there nobody was raised from
43:32 there no one ever came out I want to
43:33 push the rock open I was there the
43:35 summer of whatever zero ad that you're
43:37 calling it he never existed and then
43:40 Rome gets angry since this is our new
43:43 control apparatus this is how we're
43:45 gonna put another thousand years on the
43:47 Barbie to make sure that we don't die
43:50 and so they start the Crusades were they
43:55 killed a bunch of Christians in their
43:57 first raid it was really brilliant and
43:58 then they start the Inquisition's
44:01 forcing into the brain of man for nine
44:04 hundred years and three different phases
44:07 the belief in Christ my child would have
44:10 a baby on average at 15 years old I mean
44:13 that's when a generation turned over to
44:15 the next generation of 15 years
44:18 Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus
44:21 Christ of course we believe in this
44:23 [ __ ] today it's been driven into
44:25 your brain you have no genetic [ __ ]
44:26 hope of not believing in this guy
44:29 especially if your parents done it to
44:30 you unless one thing happens you start
44:34 thinking for yourself
44:35 so these tenured professors do exactly
44:38 the same thing they're an Inquisition on
44:40 your mind galvanizing probably false
44:45 paradigms of the past now again if the
44:48 past is organic is as organic as the
44:50 future then there's probably no
44:51 necessary crime going on I would say the
44:56 only crime that they would be committing
44:58 to be a pretty existential one which is
45:00 that man is having his true
45:05 existentialism robbed from him because
45:07 he is no longer a part of the universe
45:10 he's a part of a subjugated serfdom that
45:14 reports to the monarchy like Canada and
45:17 Australia they report to the EU they you
45:23 know report Oh some other entity they
45:27 don't own themselves but are always the
45:30 subjugated ones right the big
45:36 improvement that we have to make and
45:38 mankind right now is to push all these
45:42 people back no deGrasse Tyson has to go
45:47 from hero to zero done Bill Nye the
45:52 douchebag guy he's not even [ __ ]
45:55 invited to talk he has no education of
45:58 any [ __ ] level that's interesting see
46:01 you later you played a fictional
46:02 character in some Seattle television
46:05 show or they gave you the title of
46:08 science guy
46:09 at least Neil deGrasse Tyson's got a PhD
46:11 at least he could change his ways stop
46:14 saying the [ __ ] world's a pair and
46:18 you know go from Saul to Paul right he's
46:21 a serial killer of true science
46:26 he could go from that into the truth
46:28 movement and say you know what first
46:30 things first I don't know [ __ ] that's
46:32 the first thing though the grass Tyson
46:33 has to say I don't know [ __ ] I'm just
46:35 like all you guys I don't know [ __ ] but
46:38 here's what I'm gonna do know the grass
46:41 Tyson needs to say I'm a smart person
46:43 and now that my heart has been
46:45 straightened out and I'm stopped taking
46:47 paychecks to [ __ ] over little kids
46:49 brains I'm going to figure out what the
46:56 truth is I'm gonna stop hanging out with
47:00 stuffy old tenured professors I'm not
47:04 starting out with some edgy kids who are
47:08 definitely strung out on some crap we're
47:11 sure but that's the penalty of opening
47:13 your mind taking away the filter this
47:19 little template in front of your brain
47:20 that says well let that end don't let
47:22 that in right it's like one of those
47:23 coin sorter things right when you get a
47:26 PhD in this country well you could have
47:31 taken everything from a penny to a
47:32 quarter to a half dollar to a susan b
47:35 anthony but now
47:38 you got your degree and you can only
47:41 accept dimes the smallest form of
47:44 information you Brits it's a P I don't
47:49 even know that it's funny it was no
47:51 quitter Britain the amount of dollars /
47:55 pounds British sterling in coin is
47:59 really cool like they had a five pound
48:01 coin remember translating my money and I
48:03 got a bunch of little coins and I'm like
48:05 this is five on it and I'm thinking five
48:07 cents and it's actually five pounds and
48:09 I'm like I'm tipping the the cabbie once
48:12 for dropping me off at the British
48:14 Museum I'm a burbs a 45-minute ride
48:16 through London I gave this guy like five
48:21 pounds and he looked at me he was angry
48:24 and he goes no no that's too much what
48:26 do you have and he just takes his spots
48:28 a couple or smaller coins out of there
48:29 and he goes he drove off and I was like
48:32 wow
48:33 he was so ethical he took lesser money
48:37 that was awesome do we inject things
48:40 into our past I don't know man I think
48:45 it could be an illusion that is created
48:48 through sheer discovery but I do feel
48:52 like certain theories just turn into
48:54 fractals it just keeps getting like the
48:56 more you zoom in there's more there and
48:57 there's more you zoom the more you go
48:58 down the rabbit hole the rabbit hole
49:00 like a video game like Diablo or
49:02 something 3 it just generates it in
49:04 front of you infinitely because you're
49:07 inquisitive and if time has no rule time
49:13 is infinitely divisible reality is
49:17 infinitely divisible and it's infinitely
49:19 [Music]
49:20 multiplied like you can make it as big
49:22 as you want or as tiny as you want you
49:23 can divide and multiply whatever you
49:25 want to do it goes infinite we know
49:27 that's the way the universe works right
49:28 we know that's the way the number sets
49:30 and our brains work is it the same above
49:33 as it is below cuz if that's the case
49:35 holy [ __ ] time itself you know look at
49:41 the the cameras that shoot a million
49:43 frames per second nowadays they can see
49:45 the light going through a bottle of
49:49 water
49:51 what does that do they've divided time 1
49:54 million times in one second
49:56 well I'm sure they're right around the
49:58 corner from 10 million frames per second
50:00 or 100 million frames per second and
50:02 when they get there they're probably
50:03 going to discover something more about
50:06 how the universe works
50:07 and then they're probably hide eight
50:08 because it reveals too much power to us
50:10 but that's why these cool indie channels
50:13 on YouTube are really fun somehow this
50:16 guy gets old of a camera that would
50:18 otherwise cost fifty thousand dollars
50:20 has no monetary purpose I mean we can do
50:24 call people up hey do you have anything
50:25 I can film in a million frames per
50:27 second that then you could turn into
50:28 marketing material that would help you
50:29 sell an air-conditioner uh what you know
50:34 but they get these amazing inventions
50:37 and they do amazing things with them
50:39 it's really really cool when I learned
50:42 that an electron microscope has to be
50:46 logged to the United States government
50:48 so if you have one and correct me if I'm
50:51 wrong this is what I've heard three
50:52 times in my lifetime but if you own one
50:54 of these things you have to register it
50:56 with the United States government and
50:58 then every single experiment that you
51:01 run in the thing has to be logged with
51:03 the University that then is filtered up
51:05 to the government it is an honor system
51:07 alright there's no videotape as far as I
51:10 know hand it in with it I don't know if
51:12 today all you had to do is say every
51:16 time you turn the electricity on the
51:17 pictures go to the government and then
51:21 you'd be hard to turn it on without the
51:25 government knowing what you did but
51:26 there's probably old machines out there
51:28 that can do it they don't have that
51:29 capability [ __ ] I don't know it's like
51:34 go [ __ ] yourself if I can afford this
51:37 piece of equipment I'm not making
51:39 plutonium rods for [ __ ] sake I'm just
51:41 looking at teeny tiny elements of the
51:44 universe what are you worried about dude
51:47 what are you worried about me
51:49 discovering because if you're worried
51:51 that means you've already discovered it
51:52 yourself and you're just trying to keep
51:54 me from doing it you know what I would
51:58 love to hear from anyone who knows more
51:59 about this is someone that registers a
52:03 an experiment inside
52:05 electron microscope and someone getting
52:08 denied all right the letter comes back
52:10 and says you're not to do that I don't
52:13 get the sense that there's some sort of
52:14 ecosystem that does that right that you
52:16 ask and you get approved and then you
52:18 get to do it and it's going straight up
52:19 to some deep state laboratory I don't
52:23 think that that's even possible without
52:26 just absolutely ganking the world I
52:29 absolutely do believe that we have
52:36 history that is really there whether it
52:40 be the architecture of our ancestors
52:43 which would be the case if if it is all
52:47 conceptual and consensus based you know
52:51 they found this huge I'll give you an
52:53 example they found a huge what they say
52:57 is a meteor impact crater just north of
53:00 South America it's the dinosaur killing
53:03 extinction event thingy right it is
53:09 seemingly massive it seems like it would
53:14 not be an eruption out of the center of
53:17 the earth but it also seems so utterly
53:21 massive that if it was a rock that did
53:24 it this planet might have just simply
53:27 cease to be round and it might have had
53:29 to reconstitute from scratch like an
53:31 earth killer I don't mean species I mean
53:34 shape right what's interesting about
53:38 that theory is that if a rock were to
53:41 hit the surface of the earth and create
53:43 such a crater then the soil at the
53:47 center of that sphere of that circle
53:49 excuse me would have to be very thin
53:51 because it just was pulverized fairly
53:55 recently few hundred million years ago
53:57 but changed [ __ ] so the lifespan of our
53:59 planet which supposedly what randomly
54:02 three and a half billion years old okay
54:04 where they get these numbers man you
54:06 know if unbelievable how they theorize
54:09 this stuff I mean you know hats off for
54:12 theorizing it but publishing books that
54:14 says this is de-facto hit I've got a
54:17 book called three
54:18 five billion years it's sort of
54:21 laughable when you wake up but it'd be
54:24 funny to drive around neighborhoods with
54:26 the ice cream truck song blaring on your
54:27 stereo and everybody comes out and it's
54:30 just you just driving around everyone's
54:32 knee rude
54:33 so in closing let's let's wrap it up
54:37 with the a big what if what if we're
54:41 right in this episode the time is just
54:44 as malleable going backwards as it is
54:46 going forward that we live in a cloud of
54:50 recorded events recorded States just
54:56 like the car race car track this is a
54:58 simulation we're not really going around
55:02 a track it's all being simulated what if
55:05 this video I'm not trying to make
55:07 something happen here but just say this
55:10 video where to go as viral as Gundam
55:12 style right it gets out there and a
55:14 billion people watch this video and a
55:17 billion people think this thing through
55:19 and minds fifty thousand times more
55:22 brilliant than my own or yours really
55:25 dig this down and find out that it's
55:27 true that there could be proven there's
55:30 no longer a hunch anymore it's proven
55:32 Mendell effect goes from being this
55:34 crazy side theory to being the next what
55:38 is it 2012 thing where the Mayan
55:41 calendar said we're all going to cease
55:42 to exist right there's books published
55:45 on it that did it done do we run the
55:47 risk of undoing reality or do we gain
55:55 unbelievable control I don't necessarily
55:58 feel smart enough to control my reality
56:01 at all right there's a bunch of wind
56:04 blowing and Leafs flapping around in
56:06 front of me I got a rosebush over there
56:08 palm tree over there's a big thing
56:09 you're a bogan via that right there I
56:11 don't want to have to concentrate on all
56:13 that stuff
56:15 but now what if we look at some of the
56:16 past events that have taken place that
56:18 we really regret took place and we I
56:24 don't know we get together in a big
56:26 giant global campfire and then we seeing
56:31 some new equivalent of kumbaya where
56:34 somebody drops the base and we undo it
56:39 in fact we think about flying saucers
56:45 and they land right we could do anything
56:48 we want and again we must paid heed to
56:53 the theory inside Forbidden Planet such
56:55 that our Adar inner consciousness
56:57 doesn't go absolutely crazy that guy's
56:58 just holding his mind together and his
57:01 life together it was like one second
57:03 away from going full-blown serial killer
57:06 or mass killer or whatever he's not a
57:09 bunch of pharmaceuticals his school gave
57:12 him when he was in grade school you know
57:15 but to be careful with that kid maybe
57:18 it's some way to reel a bit rehabilitate
57:20 those people you take a really unstable
57:22 person and just like jumping in a lake
57:24 of lake havasu and you let it soothe
57:26 your soul and your frequency down we sue
57:30 them take a homeless person who's
57:34 struggling to keep the voices out of
57:36 their head because of malnutrition and
57:38 true isolation they talk to themselves
57:40 and they hear voices I mean they really
57:42 hear them then we put them in a room
57:45 with a bunch of people and we think at
57:47 them
57:48 we're in an environment that's
57:50 unbelievable and they just sort of
57:54 normalize
57:57 there's no there's no medicine other
58:02 than my chemical cocktails they put in
58:05 their bodies
58:06 maybe it's surrounding them with
58:08 gigantic crystal chambers we think at
58:12 the crystals and we think at them and
58:14 they just started getting injected with
58:18 real calm spirits you know after we're
58:21 all down we'll take him to the hemp
58:22 clothing store get him all set up
58:25 secretly this is sort of related topic I
58:30 have this hope that someone as renowned
58:35 as Neil deGrasse Tyson does flip-flop
58:42 away from indoctrinated science that he
58:49 like the kids who made loose change it
58:51 exposed 9/11 that they went into debunk
58:57 the conspiracies and ended up making the
58:59 most convincing film of all time that it
59:02 was truly a conspiracy now though those
59:06 events are horrible and what have you
59:07 but I'd I would settle for the fabric of
59:11 the universe being opened back up with
59:13 the fabric of consciousness opened up
59:17 with paradigms being erased or at least
59:20 loosened up to be more symbolic and
59:22 allegorical until we can really shake
59:24 out if anything at all is truly set in
59:28 stone I think every man a woman and
59:31 child can conceive of some sort of
59:35 simulator to the universe someplace
59:38 where you could flip a switch time would
59:40 cease to progress in terms of your aging
59:43 process or what have you but you would
59:45 have your own simulation you could bring
59:49 facts emily's of your friends and family
59:50 in there or people you don't know you
59:52 could make a human being that you simply
59:54 doesn't exist have a conversation with
59:56 them you could pull in Faraday and Tesla
60:00 and Einstein all the same room and have
60:01 a conversation and sort through it all
60:03 you can sort through it as they existed
60:05 on earth you can sort through it maybe
60:07 as their celestial spirit once they left
60:09 and figured out
60:10 they were either right or wrong we can
60:13 conceive of that pretty simply but
60:15 that's a universe with no boundaries
60:16 well we make when we make video games
60:19 okay it is truly the art of creating
60:23 that universe and then applying rules to
60:25 create a style guide and a feeling to
60:28 create false lore well if we can
60:31 conceive that today 2018 then I think
60:36 it's at least possible that the universe
60:39 itself could be as malleable that all
60:43 we're doing is echoing the algorithms of
60:46 freedom that are in the universe today I
60:50 think you feel me deep thoughts
60:55 radio.com for all the feeds audio/video
60:58 locked Facebook group patreon page and a
61:01 little teeny tiny store please comment

61:49 book cover and come back for more so
61:53 that's pretty good
61:54 anyway take care of yourself and someone
61:56 else that I'll see in the next deep
61:57 thoughts over now
