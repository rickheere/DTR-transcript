00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen I got a question for you
00:40 what if within the next two years of
00:45 society its 2018 right now but if in the
00:50 next two years scientists could prove
00:54 not the shitty scientists the world but
00:56 let's say the truth move at scientists
00:58 come together we hold summits and we
01:03 prove to the world that the Mandela
01:04 effect is real but that its cause is
01:10 merely the collective consciousness of
01:13 all living beings in this sector of
01:15 forever and that we have merely
01:19 conceived of everything and that's why
01:25 some people see the world flat and some
01:27 people see the world round some people
01:32 see all the evidence they need for Lee
01:35 Harvey Oswald's shooting JFK and some
01:38 people see all the other people involved
01:41 and that the ruling class of this place
01:46 which we also perceive
01:50 one may or may not exist because we were
01:54 told that someone named Lord Rothschild
01:58 lives in Europe does this stuff controls
02:02 the price of gold is psychotic whatever
02:06 and he runs the world quite a bit we
02:10 hear that story and then we believe it
02:13 and then our brain we pass around images
02:16 online of what these individuals look
02:18 like right but there really are
02:21 non-player characters and they're simply
02:25 because we conceive of them filling gaps
02:27 in the storyline because perhaps there's
02:32 only a few of us what if there's only a
02:35 few of us on this entire planet whatever
02:39 shape it might be stars maybe they're
02:45 just artifacts of the way that our mind
02:46 processes information perhaps it is part
02:52 of our entity it's the tentacles of our
02:54 mind well we're actually living inside
02:56 of our brain and all the stars are just
02:59 the touch points to the edge of our
03:01 proverbial skull and we're all inside
03:07 now what would you do or what would we
03:10 do
03:11 first question must be presented on a
03:13 personal level of course if they simply
03:17 could prove it there's a little thought
03:20 experiments right I don't know what
03:24 episodes coming that's gonna reveal this
03:26 but I had a friend of mine they couldn't
03:29 get the amounts to work on there are
03:31 there's you know the USB connection to
03:34 the keyboard to work on their iMac he
03:37 had a major deadline they called me up
03:38 help help help I said well I've already
03:41 helped you once and we we swapped a
03:43 keyboard it's not the keyboards fault
03:45 you've tried you know wiggling it in the
03:48 port and that seems to work within a few
03:50 that which means that port should be bad
03:52 but if you moved to other ports it still
03:54 has the same problem so I don't know
03:55 what the hell the problem is just keep
03:57 doing it and then
03:59 get it to work on the phone finally I
04:01 just said look remember I was over there
04:03 the other day and you got to work yeah
04:05 and you were so sure you could get it to
04:08 work right yeah let's go back to that
04:11 moment remember that moment I was in
04:14 front of the computer I was unable to
04:16 get it to work
04:17 you laughed and you reach behind you
04:19 said it's just a simple blah blah blah
04:22 boom it worked over the phone they got
04:26 to work instantaneously and it was like
04:29 this while Epiphany I could hear the
04:32 shock and the person's voice and the
04:34 other side where they were like god damn
04:36 it that's weird is that possible
04:39 and I said because we control the
04:42 universe we manifest it we're just not
04:45 told that that's the way it works now
04:47 there was a movie called the secret
04:49 which kind of talked all about this you
04:51 manifest your reality but what they're
04:54 not able to do in that or didn't choose
04:57 to do was to prove it to you right but
05:04 now how would it change your life how
05:08 would it change your life if they could
05:09 prove it to you or if those of you who
05:14 are happy with your life I think it's
05:17 gonna be very incidental you know
05:20 made-up variants a little bit you'll be
05:22 kind of like oh wow neat let's go out to
05:25 the beach and let's continue to be happy
05:28 for those of you having a crappy life
05:31 you're in that valley of life right and
05:34 you need to bounce back out or you just
05:36 sort of felt like well I've always been
05:40 sick I've always been poor I've always
05:42 been the butt of people's jokes for that
05:46 kind of person it is an escape pod
05:51 because now if they could prove it to
05:53 themselves and attend these conferences
05:56 and read the materials online and meet
05:58 people and do little experiments and
06:00 prove to themselves that we control
06:01 absolutely everything that exists the
06:05 laws of physics are simply our consensus
06:09 on how things work right
06:12 for the person suffering they're like oh
06:15 my god I'm getting the hell out of Dodge
06:18 I am NOT going to be one that suffers
06:22 now the funny thing is is that there is
06:25 this movement slowly maturing online
06:31 which one of our listeners is talking to
06:37 me about and it you know I just
06:40 coincidentally June episode where I mean
06:43 I could probably make a hepa set on this
06:44 particular subject but it's hard to go
06:48 on for an hour and keep everyone
06:49 interested in it so embed it again
06:51 inside this episode which is that there
06:53 are none there might be non player
06:54 characters in our universe for those of
07:00 you who don't play video games what this
07:01 means is is that people like Obama
07:05 aren't real human really human beings
07:08 they don't have souls which is why
07:10 they're capable of doing the things that
07:11 they do they are there to provide an
07:15 antagonist to our protagonist journey in
07:18 this simulation you know there's a movie
07:22 Total Recall that came out in 1988 with
07:24 Arnold Schwarzenegger and the premise of
07:27 the story is that he is a he's literally
07:31 a I have a jackhammer going down the
07:33 street he's a jackhammer guy he's
07:36 literally pounds rocks all day long
07:38 hates his life aids his job all he has a
07:40 really hot wife and he wants more and he
07:44 keeps dreaming about being on Mars and
07:46 so he goes to this vacation center
07:49 called Total Recall which is that they
07:51 implant in your brain the vacation that
07:52 you wish you had okay however at the
07:57 last second they upsell him on an idea
07:59 that is to go on some super agent or
08:05 instead of being himself he gets to be
08:07 someone else and the idea is he's gonna
08:11 lay back in this machine you're gonna
08:12 put this vacation in his memory that he
08:14 is not only on Mars but he's a secret
08:16 agent he saves he gets a girl and he
08:20 saves the world and coincidentally he
08:23 ends up becoming that person
08:25 and it's so convincing to us that we're
08:27 not sure whether or not he went on
08:28 vacation or whether or not he is
08:32 actually this Dennis Quaid character I
08:37 think is his name the clue in the movie
08:42 is that the nerd before putting in the
08:44 memory stick to give him the trip he
08:48 goes Oh blue sky on Mars I've never seen
08:52 this one before everybody misses that
08:55 line and that's the key as to what
08:57 really went on but in that scenario he
09:01 would have gone to Mars we did go to
09:03 Mars in this fictional movie and there
09:06 obviously are all these bad guys after
09:09 well he is the only consciousness in
09:11 this story that is real and everyone
09:13 else is fake and I think that the whole
09:17 notion of this NPC model that marries
09:20 very well with what I'm going to make
09:22 the theme of this particular episode is
09:25 that we see inconceivably evil people
09:28 they don't behave normally their scripts
09:34 are pretty trite right when have you
09:37 ever seen Hillary Clinton ever speak in
09:39 anything but the most brainless trite
09:43 drivel never you have never heard that
09:49 woman speak intelligently with any
09:51 original thoughts she is a [ __ ]
09:54 Westworld you know you know run off kind
10:00 of person that you know it's like when
10:02 you drinking a coke and at the end you
10:04 know the beer and there's that spittle
10:06 at the end that you don't even drink
10:08 yourself that's what she is
10:12 so unbelievable and it's a [ __ ] ton of
10:15 them right it's amazing that Westworld
10:19 came out when it did because there's all
10:22 this metaphorical interesting things
10:27 between that simulation world and what
10:30 we live in the hosts right the robots
10:34 that provide all of the
10:38 tagging istic and protagonistic
10:41 sometimes roles within a storyline to
10:43 draw out of you your true essence as to
10:47 what you really are as a person right
10:48 that's the whole initial benefit of
10:53 Westworld it helps you find who you are
10:56 I think that's fascinating we're left to
11:01 your own devices who could you be but
11:05 yourself when you're not being observed
11:06 by anyone and you don't have to worry
11:08 about repercussions of anything that you
11:10 do you I think would typically go
11:14 through a very chaotic stage of just
11:18 running around and doing anything I mean
11:20 you know if you took someone who had
11:22 been 20 years inside corporate America
11:24 they worked downtown New York and they
11:27 are saddled with bills and relationship
11:32 responsibilities and parental
11:33 responsibilities and you just put them
11:35 in a simulation and you said you're free
11:38 do anything that you want you can't kill
11:41 yourself you there's no one there dude
11:43 hurt you can't kill anyone else here's
11:47 New York go what time of day you want it
11:49 to be okay it's two o'clock in the
11:51 afternoon 75 degrees Suns perfect go I
11:56 don't know would they run around
11:58 breaking windows take a car sick some
12:02 Ferrari park downtown in Manhattan drive
12:04 it around like crazy and spin out and
12:06 crash into things and who knows
12:10 I think there'd be this chaotic moment
12:13 of doing absolutely anything and then I
12:14 think there'd be this huge calm because
12:17 they just break themselves like I'm a
12:20 black stallion black stallions are
12:24 really really really hard to break
12:26 because they are their own horse and I
12:30 mean they they make you earn it then
12:35 they're loyalists could be right
12:38 so the reason why I bring this up in
12:42 this particular episode and I brought it
12:44 up a little bit in the law of attraction
12:46 episode is that it makes sense you know
12:54 scientists that want to discover
12:55 something new and something profound
12:57 they have a couple choices okay you can
13:01 pull the thread out of a sweater and
13:03 follow each follicle up into the sweater
13:06 slowly but surely
13:07 right that's what your left brain
13:08 scientists will do but your right brain
13:11 Gnostic scientist will simply learn a
13:16 tremendous amount about the connections
13:20 of the universe as discovered by
13:21 previous man they are able to decipher
13:25 what seems to make no sense at all and
13:29 then they sit cross their legs go into a
13:34 lotus position and listen to the
13:36 universal me not literally but probably
13:38 wouldn't hurt and you listen to the
13:41 universe and you just let instead of
13:45 consciously trying to hang on to the the
13:48 anal-retentive rules about how
13:50 everything works in the universe you
13:52 were able to let it and meld together
13:57 now that I think in ether wins and I
14:01 would say in the last probably even just
14:02 eight months I've really started to
14:05 remodel the entire planet and all
14:07 existence inside of this eath remodel
14:10 and my brain is kind of doing the Tesla
14:12 thing where it's as I look at something
14:16 I am seeing the swirling nature of its
14:21 mass in three-dimensional space and I'm
14:26 just letting things coalesce in my brain
14:28 and then there's the life force that
14:30 goes in between these things right and
14:34 it is starting to make the universe one
14:36 of the most beautiful things I've ever
14:39 seen but what that ends up doing is once
14:42 you again you can you can take material
14:45 objects and make them exist through all
14:48 these ether occurrence
14:49 and then you overlay inside of that the
14:52 blood supply which is the life
14:54 consciousness that we are you have a
14:57 different marriage a different
14:59 relationship between everything in the
15:01 universe and now when I look at the
15:05 Mandela effect it's starting to mean
15:08 something completely different you know
15:12 I reference from time to time the movie
15:13 Forbidden Planet from 1956 with Leslie
15:15 Nielsen and company and the reason why
15:20 that movie always comes back to me
15:21 especially when talking about the world
15:24 sort of being a collective consciousness
15:27 simulation and I'll tell you why there's
15:32 a bit of a problem with this in my brain
15:34 but I'm still trying to resolve I guess
15:37 is it in the movie Forbidden Planet
15:39 which every human being on earth should
15:41 say they have seen more than once
15:45 discuss stuff for chicks to is that they
15:48 found a planet that was inhabited by a
15:52 race called The Crow and the Kuril was a
15:57 planet was it was a race that had
15:58 actually built a machine that allowed
16:01 their consciousness to go into free form
16:07 where they were able to lose all their
16:11 instrumentalities meaning their bodies
16:12 and they would will live in their
16:14 consciousness and then using this
16:16 machine their consciousness would
16:18 manifest whatever reality they wanted so
16:21 if they wanted to be a tiger one day
16:22 they'd be a tiger if they wanted to be a
16:24 cloud that could be a cloud but
16:27 immediately they realized that their
16:28 subconscious the it'd
16:31 Freudian metaphors right that they
16:36 weren't mature enough to turn that
16:38 machine on meaning when they turned it
16:40 on they had hatred still deep in their
16:42 soul and so as the it'd was exposed to
16:45 infinite power to manifest itself into
16:48 the world that ate each other up and
16:50 destroyed each other so no sooner that
16:53 they turned the machine on that the
16:54 whole race simply disappeared and a big
16:56 vitamin of violent explosion of sub
17:00 consciousness well the writers of that
17:04 script who I have no familiarity with
17:08 whatsoever
17:11 were beyond brilliant beyond brilliant
17:16 because here we are sitting in 2018 many
17:22 years later over 65 years later and this
17:27 is sort of the adversarial role against
17:32 the theory that we actually do hold this
17:34 whole thing together because man isn't
17:38 at the level of this and yet it would
17:43 seem that somehow we are able to
17:44 influence it
17:48 their experiments in quantum physics
17:49 were a light wave observed by a man
17:55 human changes its behavior from a light
17:59 wave that is not observed uh-huh
18:03 that's mine [ __ ] trust me yeah and you
18:07 just read this I read this in the late
18:09 70s early 80s and you're like what oh
18:14 yeah
18:15 it just happens we're not sure why the
18:18 holographic universe booked the first
18:20 third or fourth of the book
18:22 sorry third third to 50% of the book
18:25 talks about experiment after experiment
18:27 were machines observed by man
18:31 change behavior I've talked about the
18:34 several times but now the point of this
18:38 episode is to say what if we proved I
18:41 mean we actually already have to be
18:43 honest but what if we proved it in a
18:45 much more coarse way I'll give you
18:48 another example
18:49 evolution obviously we could be created
18:55 by aliens or God and evolution could
18:58 still be a part of the everyday life you
19:01 know you evolve you evolve from a child
19:03 to an adult that much we know couples
19:08 that hang out together really early end
19:10 up looking like each other
19:12 and I don't just mean they were the same
19:13 blue top and my bottoms they start
19:17 looking like each other
19:20 it's weird they harmonize their very
19:22 genetics I've got two or three friends
19:25 like this it used to look like someone
19:27 different from each other and then they
19:29 dated really early and then it's like
19:32 they look like each other it look like
19:36 brother and sister basically but they
19:39 tell us that you know in your life time
19:42 there'll be no evolution in any
19:45 creatures lifetime they will never
19:46 evolve from their core genetic or their
19:50 protein patterns that are dictating how
19:53 the DNA grows to anything new that you
19:57 can observe and I think that's [ __ ]
20:00 I think we see it happen in a person's
20:03 lifetime sometimes you're not going to
20:06 grow a third arm like as if I'd be
20:08 Barack's but I think we evolved to the
20:12 extent that we use our minds we become
20:15 completely different human beings some
20:19 of you can really remember your past you
20:21 can remember being in your teenage years
20:23 and now you're you're above 40 let's say
20:26 and you look back as to who you were at
20:30 12 14 15 years old maybe even 18 and you
20:35 go my god I am so completely a different
20:39 human being my spirit is different how I
20:42 identify myself is completely different
20:44 my confidence levels differ my clothes
20:46 are different what kind of food I like
20:50 is still a different we all know that
20:52 the second that you believe you can do
20:53 something is the second you have a
20:55 chance of being able to do it so again
20:58 I'll pose the question again and again
21:01 what if we as a society could prove that
21:05 this world is based on some collective
21:10 consciousness
21:12 now the fragility of man's consciousness
21:15 would almost completely contradict my
21:18 notion which is to say man isn't stable
21:21 enough as a human being our
21:23 consciousness is too chaotic and too
21:25 self-centered or fragile like a bunch of
21:30 tissue paper in a windstorm
21:32 to be able to hold that
21:34 palm tree over there in place this house
21:36 in place the computer electronics in
21:38 place so what could possibly be the
21:43 anchor of consciousness that would take
21:46 care of 99.9999% still leaving open that
21:51 fraction of a percent for us to change
21:56 Luke I'm your father - no I'm your
21:59 father
22:01 again you know I just watched a video
22:04 not more than 48 hours ago were Mark
22:07 Hamill looks like he's 20 years 20 years
22:10 ago somewhere in the 90s was on some
22:12 game show and they asked him to repeat
22:15 the line Luke I'm your father
22:18 and he does it on TV
22:21 apparently the the USS minnow which the
22:25 ship from Gilligan's Island was
22:28 initially spelled with two N's and now
22:31 it's spelled with one in and there's
22:32 interviews with people that are involved
22:34 in production historians that say the
22:36 course they spelled it with two ins of
22:37 course they spelled it with two ins you
22:38 know and why it's this weird stuff I
22:42 don't know right Luke I'm your father
22:46 well I could understand the the absolute
22:50 vortex of consciousness on that one line
22:54 because it is a very profound line in
22:57 all of filmmaking I don't know of
22:59 another line besides perhaps frankly
23:01 dear my dear I don't give a damn
23:03 from Gone with the Wind and that's
23:07 that's just a dirty word that's why that
23:10 was popular but no I'm your father or
23:12 Luke I'm your father man that is a
23:14 pivotal moment in everyone's life who
23:17 was in the pocket in 1980 right okay but
23:22 what could hold this whole thing
23:23 together right well I think it sort of
23:28 comes down to man's definition of life
23:30 what do we accept his life
23:34 we only accept things that are like us
23:37 again I've got a crappy old coffee table
23:41 painted bright green efficient more
23:43 forest green nowadays but
23:47 that is not life anymore to me it was
23:50 made out of living wood at one point man
23:52 cut it up and made it into this shape
23:54 and there it is but it doesn't talk to
23:58 me it doesn't walk around and so for me
24:01 it's dead to me it provides a service
24:03 which I appreciate but it's not alive
24:08 but the question is is is Earth alive
24:13 isn't it weird that the cycle of life
24:15 here on earth outside of our souls but
24:20 especially for a scientist this should
24:21 be even tougher to digest okay
24:24 that the earth is providing all of the
24:27 atomic resources for a man to exist
24:30 right dust to dust ashes to ashes dust
24:32 to dust
24:33 and then all of a sudden from the earth
24:36 from its fruit and it's vegetables come
24:39 life this random [ __ ] you know idea
24:42 that something can come from nothing I
24:44 love that idea cuz it's so profoundly
24:46 [ __ ] ignorant right stupid stupidity
24:49 could be utterly fascinating right how
24:52 can you believe that [ __ ] it's it's
24:55 amazing that the cognitive dissidence in
24:58 your mind is so profound that you can
25:00 believe complete and utter horseshit
25:02 it's amazing right but what if the earth
25:06 is completely and utterly alive it's
25:11 pretty hard to say the vacuum of space
25:12 would be alive because what's there to
25:15 be alive well it's only a vacuum and
25:19 NASA's eyes right
25:20 at least the aboveboard you know crap
25:24 science version of it right now
25:26 internally they are trying to figure out
25:28 how to get through this vacuum of space
25:30 because it's so [ __ ] radioactive that
25:32 everybody would die sitting in a capsule
25:35 with no contact with the Van Allen belts
25:38 with no contacts from the Solar Flare
25:40 ambient radiation from a Sun will kill
25:43 your ass and you could be three solar
25:46 systems away from our universe and
25:49 you're still gonna die fairly rapidly
25:51 the one reason that I think that a lot
25:54 of us believe in a god outside of any
25:56 religious paradigm or even scientific
25:58 paradigm
25:59 is merely that the rules that hold us
26:01 together seem to be working really
26:03 really well but now let me throw this at
26:06 you how many of you think about your
26:10 pancreas working how many of you think
26:13 about your heart working or all the
26:16 digestive system stuff working do you
26:21 know when you have to go the bathroom
26:22 way before you have to go the back
26:24 camera it's ten o'clock in the morning I
26:25 know I'm gonna have to go the bathroom
26:27 at twelve thirteen today and then I'm
26:29 gonna have to go the bathroom again at
26:30 four or fifty two no you don't so within
26:35 the human body we have an autonomic
26:37 system which I will refer to incorrectly
26:39 at times it's odd atomic autonomic
26:42 system that runs the I don't know what
26:46 99% of our entire body we don't have to
26:49 do anything and it's completely
26:52 automated and here we are fussing with
26:54 this however many percent that we have
26:56 control of in our mind and boy are we so
27:00 preoccupied with our 3 percent over the
27:03 [ __ ] it is right hello even if you had
27:06 up to 10% of your brain's power it's
27:10 still not the majority of what your
27:12 body's doing
27:14 okay so just like when we parsed thought
27:19 in the observed reality episode this
27:23 porous parse function okay we know that
27:28 the majority of what we are is automated
27:32 it is automated through the relationship
27:35 of protein patterns that are found in
27:37 your chromosomes 50 percent your
27:39 chromosome is protein patterns they're
27:40 telling the other 50 percent of your
27:42 chromosomes DNA how to grow it's as
27:46 beautiful atomic schematic that is
27:49 essentially like the most complex IKEA
27:51 furniture that could ever be built which
27:53 is us it is then imbued with a
27:55 consciousness that rides on top of it or
27:57 through it and then you celebrate men so
28:02 let me rewind them given that knowledge
28:05 of an automated operating system within
28:07 the human construct that you have
28:10 already enjoyed to get to this point of
28:12 listening to me
28:14 perhaps that is imbued or capable of
28:20 maintaining an imprint of consciousness
28:22 of reality three space reality with five
28:26 sense body and it sort of the subsystem
28:31 that is running our body is all working
28:34 together to create this reality because
28:39 it's all automated now let me play
28:42 devil's advocate over and over and over
28:45 virtually no one in the world has been
28:47 in this backyard the percentage of
28:50 people that have been in this backyard
28:52 is absolutely next to infinitely small
28:56 nothingness I mean seriously if I were
28:59 to guess how many people have stood in
29:01 this backyard with all the previous
29:04 owners their kids their friends
29:07 barbecues I think a fairly high number
29:10 would be 50 I think a gigantic number
29:13 would be a hundred but I'm willing to
29:16 bet it's closer to 30 to 50 people
29:19 I personally in 15 years have been
29:21 responsible for maybe I don't know
29:26 ten people been in this backyard so how
29:31 does this backyard exist if everyone has
29:35 to think about it to keep it in
29:37 existence but have it how does it exist
29:41 okay well let me get you hip to some
29:45 programming techniques that are more
29:47 prevalent today than they ever were back
29:50 in the day when we made video games an
29:53 artist eventually once the programmer
29:56 stopped drawing video games an artist
29:59 had to draw the game and if they didn't
30:02 draw it it didn't exist and that worked
30:06 for the majority of the years that we
30:08 have had in video games to date but once
30:11 video game consoles got to 1080p which
30:15 was considered 4k back in the day right
30:17 about 2003 or so they started to realize
30:21 that the resolution on the screens plus
30:23 16 by 9 aspect ratio of flat monitors
30:26 was creating so much a viewport into the
30:29 world that drawing it all by hand was
30:31 extremely expensive infinitely prohibit
30:35 able to any budget that you might have
30:37 for a video game and so right off the
30:39 bat video games started look silly like
30:42 the cities' like to clean and they
30:45 didn't have the ability to tell the
30:47 stories of post-apocalyptic worlds
30:49 because there was no method to really
30:51 afford to make it look dirty and so the
30:56 coders got real smart and they said you
30:58 know we're gonna have to do it we're
30:58 gonna have to procedurally generate this
31:00 world meaning we're gonna create an
31:02 engine that's gonna follow a script and
31:06 it's going to essentially say this is
31:08 the general geometry of New York City
31:12 this is what we can send Irby the ground
31:15 this is a building this is the first
31:19 story of a building which has a lot of
31:20 different properties than the 50th story
31:22 right because what trash will go up
31:23 against the bottom of the first story of
31:25 a building
31:26 and so we started procedurally
31:29 generating worlds and now an artist
31:33 could create aluminum can that's
31:34 squashed and create a four or five
31:36 different ways and put it into the
31:37 system and go there you have five cans
31:39 have at it
31:42 decoders would then take those cans and
31:44 orient them in a million different XYZ
31:47 orientations to make sure it never quite
31:49 looks on your mind exactly the same
31:51 there's no patterns in the world in
31:53 memory it's just one can so it's pretty
31:56 affordable to the game console
31:59 it could generate you you know randomly
32:02 every single time you play the game this
32:05 happens all the time today all right how
32:09 many times have you played a video game
32:11 where the world is all shrouded in
32:14 darkness and it only reveals itself as
32:18 you walk into the darkness as some of
32:20 these video games are randomly
32:21 generating the world as you D shroud the
32:23 world so what if my consensus of what
32:27 this backyard looks like was simply
32:29 built out of the first person that
32:30 conquered this land the first algorithm
32:34 of the slam was it was farmland it's an
32:35 Orange County that used to grow oranges
32:37 here like crazy okay and then very
32:42 slowly over time it began to get
32:44 manicured by land developers who wanted
32:47 to build neighborhoods and so they
32:49 consciously added to the terrain they
32:53 put it in the archive of reality for the
32:56 rest of us to mirror those of you who
33:00 have mirrored hard drives on your
33:01 computer you know about this
33:03 so perhaps we're constructing reality as
33:06 we discover it but now let's bring
33:11 science back into it real science with
33:14 this theory I'm I'm presenting there's a
33:16 lot of problems that we'd have to
33:18 resolve what if we had two groups that
33:22 have never met each other and they've
33:25 both built machines that can dig into
33:26 the center of the earth we have a an
33:29 attaining hull that is impenetrable to
33:33 any temperatures that are conceivable in
33:36 the universe it could be at the center
33:38 of the atomic explosion and it's
33:40 completely fine and they're going to
33:43 drill to the center of the earth at the
33:44 exact same time well it's going to be
33:47 drawn through clay and well is gonna be
33:49 drawn through granite rock both machines
33:52 are infinitely capable of accomplishing
33:54 the task but now the machine is going to
33:58 be discovering what the inside of the
33:59 earth is actually made out of at the
34:01 exact same time
34:03 or some ludicrous way we have Lucas
34:06 reason or way method we have them both
34:09 the same sea level they're both going to
34:11 penetrate the earth at the exact same
34:12 time and if man is merely manifesting
34:17 reality what's going to be at the center
34:21 but if one person finds unicorn farts
34:25 and the other person finds plasma energy
34:28 because the groups are completely
34:30 different cultural groups but different
34:33 indoctrinated religions whether they be
34:35 religious or scientific they have a
34:39 completely different philosophy about
34:41 what the universe is made out of again
34:43 one of the banks is made of rainbow
34:45 sherbert and the other one thinks it's
34:46 made out of nickel alloy what's gonna
34:51 happen
34:52 we know how it works
34:54 I think no geologists will be the first
35:01 people to tell you that the earth is
35:02 covered in a bunch of different
35:03 sedimentary rocks some areas it's clay
35:07 it's the most gorgeous clay you've ever
35:09 seen again
35:11 other parts of the world it's the White
35:13 Cliffs of Dover it's coral rock
35:18 so people have deserts some people have
35:21 forests wouldn't it be fascinating if
35:25 this varying strata in the Earth's
35:30 surface is merely made out of the
35:31 cultural differences of man as man
35:33 manifests the existence of the Earth's
35:36 surface starts to get really fascinating
35:39 doesn't it
35:40 we know that people look genetically
35:43 similar different areas of the world
35:45 Asian people look different than Indian
35:47 people different than Caucasian people
35:50 than African people than Native American
35:53 people the Latin hybrids of South
35:57 America but once we establish that we
36:00 exist an Aborigine could have a child
36:04 with an Asian and because we know what
36:08 an Aborigine looks like we know what
36:09 asian looks like our brains can average
36:13 the frequencies together and we
36:14 a hybrid of the two one thing I've
36:20 always been fascinated about is the
36:21 process by which we lead there look like
36:23 our mothers our fathers or both I'm
36:27 always studying in my mind okay that
36:31 it's the anomalies that are very
36:32 interesting when you have a bunch of
36:34 children with someone and they all look
36:37 like the mom or they all look like the
36:40 dad and for me what I end up doing is I
36:43 look at the personalities of the two and
36:47 I'll say to myself well which one of the
36:50 two are more dominant in personality and
36:56 in a lot of cases and I want to almost
36:58 say all cases that I have personally
37:01 investigated if the two are sharing the
37:04 marriage beautifully 50/50 at least at
37:07 the time of birth the child is a
37:10 beautiful hybrid fifty-fifty but if one
37:14 is really owns the family they wear the
37:19 pants in the family as they say it's
37:21 amazing how the kids will all start
37:23 looking like that
37:24 adult whichever one it is the couples
37:28 that end up looking like each other are
37:30 usually defined as one very interesting
37:32 thing is that they are madly in love
37:36 madly in love they could be married 80
37:39 years and they simply can't get enough
37:41 of each other it's pretty cool when that
37:44 happens let me ask you another question
37:47 based on the principle that perhaps we
37:50 do manifest this reality in relationship
37:54 with perhaps other levels of
37:56 consciousness that we do not acknowledge
37:57 like planet Earth being alive as well
38:00 doesn't have to be alive for us to
38:02 manifest this like I told you would you
38:05 ever want that control would you fear
38:08 messing it up I don't want control that
38:11 stuff right if I read a book about black
38:15 holes I don't my backyard to turn into
38:16 one right because because I'm
38:18 manifesting its existence right you ever
38:21 talked to someone who's ridiculously
38:22 religious and they got [ __ ] rules for
38:24 everything and there's not a goddamn
38:26 mystery in the Bible they've got it all
38:28 figured out
38:28 I mean they've got incredibly ridiculous
38:31 [ __ ] rules figured out they take one
38:36 translation of the Bible and goddammit
38:38 it's every word is verbatim and and you
38:41 know obviously it's like four or five
38:42 translations away from whatever titus
38:44 flavius disciple that wrote the damn
38:46 thing if they got it all figured out and
38:49 after you get done talking to him you're
38:51 like they're gonna go work they think
38:55 they're gonna go you just have this
38:57 instinctual feeling in your chest you're
38:59 like well I'm not going to Europe pearly
39:01 gates [ __ ] in heaven I'm not standing in
39:04 line with some Peter with some goddamn
39:06 book and I'm sure as [ __ ] not going to
39:08 hell
39:09 you know for some finite crime I might
39:11 have committed on earth I'm not gonna go
39:13 to some infinite [ __ ] prison because
39:16 there's not that's not the way the
39:17 universe works you just know you just
39:18 you don't sure exactly what's after this
39:20 world but you know that's [ __ ] you
39:22 just know right but you get the sense I
39:26 get the sense that these religious
39:29 people absurdly religious people are
39:34 gonna go right where the [ __ ] they think
39:35 they're gonna go and talk about the next
39:39 lesson in their existence right the
39:42 penalty for being so absurdly obsessed
39:45 with figuring out some religious
39:47 paradigm written by man for man making
39:50 God look like a man you know you know
39:53 it's just pathetic they're gonna go
39:55 exactly where they think they're gonna
39:58 go now there's also the question of
40:02 whether or not there's a beginning to
40:03 the universe at all or is it simply an
40:06 is the plural of the imaginary number is
40:11 is at one point conceiving of something
40:17 that is that has no beginning giving
40:18 that we have a beginning middle and end
40:20 us who months right it hurts the brain
40:24 for a little bit have a beginning right
40:30 what sense does it make that anything
40:32 could simply just exist I'm gonna offer
40:37 up in this late juncture in this
40:42 particular shows existence that perhaps
40:46 the is is the only thing that really
40:47 makes sense as illogical it is to our
40:52 cycle of life if there is an is then
40:57 there's the paradigm for the notion that
40:59 everything that could ever exist does
41:01 exist
41:04 given that there's probably no such
41:06 thing as time in its since that man
41:12 manifests it right that we have a
41:14 timeline and that there's past time
41:17 happening at the same time future times
41:18 happening but it's actually not in the
41:20 presence of us because we're in the now
41:22 time and that the only road that we can
41:25 take is forward that is a paradox right
41:29 in front of your face it doesn't make
41:31 any sense just describing time makes no
41:33 sense the illusion of time is obviously
41:35 given to us because we have recollection
41:38 of previous states that we have been in
41:41 right what happens when you go to
41:44 amusement park like Disneyland well let
41:48 you park your car take the tram you buy
41:51 the ticket go in the front door and then
41:54 there's rides right inside the front
41:56 door and then there's rides all the way
41:57 to back of every single corner of
41:59 everything ok so if you measure time or
42:03 give time a perspective of your trip
42:05 into amusement park you would have to
42:08 say the time moving forward is always
42:10 going on a new ride you created some
42:12 real wild river paths through the entire
42:15 park so you never ride the same ride
42:17 twice but you know there's a time you
42:19 have to leave and you backtrack through
42:23 your previous time you see the gate that
42:27 you walk through now it's dark no one's
42:29 taking tickets anymore and there's just
42:31 someone waving one of those little you
42:33 know magic wands get out go back home
42:36 and it's almost as if you're seeing the
42:39 carcass of time that used to work that
42:43 booth used to work that used to be
42:44 someone standing there rippin tickets or
42:46 whatever now the turnstiles are all open
42:50 free they only go one direction moving
42:53 forward in time is very interesting as
42:55 it relates to this image of the universe
42:59 why not stay in a stagnant state the
43:02 entire time you are in existence and I
43:07 think the Buddhists have helped us
43:08 figure that out
43:10 Nirvana is hell as well as it's heaven a
43:13 stateless being that is in some form of
43:17 euphoria constantly as I always
43:19 referenced in this show the Q continuum
43:21 from Star Trek you do not want to stay
43:25 the same being all the time for any
43:29 length of time I don't think you'd want
43:31 to be in your body today on earth
43:33 stagnated right you wake up in bed oh
43:36 you've had a great night's sleep your
43:38 dreams are utterly phenomenal but now I
43:41 come in and I wave a magic wand and
43:43 you're in literally a paralysis mode
43:45 where you can't move your body but you
43:46 can use your brain and you're just
43:48 sitting there in bed the Sun never moves
43:50 no one ever comes to visit you you are
43:52 stuck in bed there's no bed source but
43:55 you're not accomplishing anything in
43:56 your day the life cycle that you have
43:59 enjoyed your entire existence has been
44:01 assassinated and that's most Christians
44:06 beliefs about heaven is an assassinated
44:09 existence so it would seem that however
44:12 the universe was created either by us or
44:15 by some divine being or beings the one
44:20 thing they understood was that things
44:23 have to change otherwise we live in hell
44:25 so thank your lucky stars for those of
44:28 you in some sort of suicidal thought
44:30 process hopefully you just randomly bump
44:34 it in this episode but think about it
44:35 the one piece of advice any one of us
44:37 can give you who have been absolutely
44:38 down and out to a level of absolute
44:42 self-destruction is that tomorrow does
44:45 not equal the past and that's the
44:48 beautiful thing you will always dig
44:50 yourself out of the worst situation that
44:52 you're in there's people who have been
44:54 sentenced to life sentences in prison
44:55 they will never see anything other than
44:57 the prison and they get in there and
44:59 they think their life is over and for a
45:02 while it feels that way but if you watch
45:04 the shows where they interview these
45:05 individuals over and over dozens and
45:08 dozens of them they found a way to
45:11 shrink their universe to the walls of
45:14 the prison hopefully they not completely
45:19 a solitary confinement but even if they
45:21 are in solitary confinement that little
45:22 tiny cell
45:23 is their world and they figure out a way
45:26 to create microcosms of entertainment
45:30 and things change
45:32 there's parole hearings sometimes maybe
45:35 there's a little bit of leniency hey you
45:37 don't have to stay in solitary
45:39 confinement for absolutely forever
45:40 you're not on death row gonna get out a
45:44 little bit more help maybe the whole
45:46 world changes and we don't put anybody
45:48 in prison anymore because we have some
45:49 Clockwork Orange rehabilitation you
45:53 never know people go into violent and
45:57 they calm down so people go in barely a
46:00 criminal and they turn into monsters
46:02 and then they calm down I hope that you
46:06 can see that one of the patterns that I
46:07 use on this show really has to do with
46:11 that catchphrase which is as it is above
46:17 so - it is a below I'm pounding that in
46:20 my brain all the time well we want to
46:23 discover something about ourselves we
46:26 must look out to the universe and find
46:28 themes functional themes and
46:31 psychological themes that mirror our own
46:33 existence and as you've seen in this
46:36 show hopefully in this particular
46:37 episode they're everywhere they're
46:41 absolutely everywhere one of the values
46:45 that I am endeavoring to bring you is
46:49 that if your life is really really busy
46:53 and you don't have the time to sit
46:57 around and think like the old Greek
46:59 philosophers and scientists of
47:02 yesteryear who sat on the steps of the
47:04 universities and just simply thought
47:07 we've sat across from each other at some
47:09 lunch and Athens or wherever where they
47:15 shared ideas and they were off thinking
47:17 for two or three months about one
47:19 subject and the other one was thinking
47:20 about a very similar subject but they're
47:22 coming at it from a completely different
47:23 angle and then they sit down and they
47:26 share a plate of dates or whatever and
47:29 in between there this is to the bathroom
47:32 they shared
47:35 what they had discovered perhaps they
47:39 found some unifying principles between
47:42 their different approaches perhaps at
47:46 times they bounced off each other and
47:47 said you know you're full of [ __ ] well
47:48 no you're full of [ __ ] I'll see you in a
47:50 week okay and the other time they said
47:53 that's fascinating isn't interesting how
47:54 I think we're going towards the same
47:56 means to an end you know we'll come into
48:00 the same conclusions and there's
48:03 anomalies in both our theories but once
48:05 they mix them together there's this
48:06 beautiful unity the show is trying to
48:10 create that sort of atmosphere for you
48:13 if you're extremely busy or if you have
48:16 a lot of time to think about things from
48:17 time to time you're able to pull some of
48:22 these concepts into your own thinking
48:24 the comments section in every video is
48:26 your chance to share back which you have
48:28 discovered one of the fundamental
48:31 principles of being in existence is to
48:33 gain control over your environment every
48:37 insect does it every animal does it they
48:42 want control especially those that build
48:45 shelters
48:48 tried to feed a hungry dog and then
48:51 reach for the food they will defend
48:55 their food because they want control
48:57 over their appetite they don't like
49:00 feeling hungry and they'll bite your
49:02 hand off if you go for right for any of
49:06 you who have dabbled in say martial arts
49:08 for instance or boxing or something when
49:14 you join that Regiment and let's say you
49:18 didn't bring anything with you any
49:21 knowledge with you
49:21 you haven't scrapped as a as a young kid
49:24 you're kind of freaked out because you
49:28 think well [ __ ] everyone else there's
49:29 already been there for longer than me
49:31 even if someone's been there week has
49:32 more control over the fight how to do it
49:36 and so you're rapidly trying to fill
49:38 your brain with first-year defense
49:41 maneuvers to protect yourself against
49:45 someone doing you harm luckily most of
49:49 these places have some rules about
49:50 killing each other and then you learned
49:53 your offensive moves and now you can
49:56 start taking control over who gets to
49:59 push you around even in a sparring match
50:01 right camaraderie is usually the third
50:06 thing that occurs that once you start to
50:08 realize okay I know what it's like to
50:10 get hit in the face I know what it's
50:12 like to get kicked in the ribs I know
50:14 how to defend myself against being
50:16 kicked in the ribs in a way that is
50:17 typical and hurts and I know how to
50:22 counter strike when I am struck in some
50:26 way because it offsets their body it
50:28 puts them in a weak state in most cases
50:29 and now I'm gonna look for those
50:31 patterns and you build up muscle memory
50:33 for maneuvers and use your peripheral
50:35 vision instead of you're dead on vision
50:37 which is why they always tell you
50:39 usually they look in the chest of a
50:40 human being during a fight because your
50:43 peripheral vision is way faster than
50:45 your front frustum of a vision and
50:48 things just start to happen how many
50:52 times is someone thrown like a sock at
50:53 your face and you flinch even though the
50:56 socket hit you completely in the face
50:58 and you'd be okay because your body has
51:00 all this autonomic
51:02 programming to protect you especially
51:04 protecting the eyes right cuz back in
51:08 the day we didn't have hospitals and
51:10 when you cut yourself you could bleed
51:12 out you could get infections and you
51:14 would die the reason I mentioned that is
51:16 that it is a metaphor of example for how
51:20 we live our normal lives outside of any
51:22 confrontation a lot of times people will
51:26 say wise people will say well you have
51:28 to pick your battles it's a very wise
51:32 statement and the statement what it
51:33 really means is there's only so much
51:38 time in the day it's only so much so
51:41 many resources you have and so you got
51:44 to pick your battles carefully we don't
51:47 really want to focus on the actual
51:49 confrontation itself in this
51:50 conversation what we want to do is focus
51:54 on the underpinnings of gaining control
51:57 such that we can avoid battles but now
52:03 any of you who've ever philosophized and
52:04 you try to gain perception of your
52:06 existence you will know that there has
52:10 to be a process that you develop around
52:11 whatever solution you're trying to
52:13 discover you just have to otherwise you
52:17 will run out of time as I mentioned in
52:20 several episodes you know those people
52:22 that are very high-strung and you might
52:25 be one of those people right now in your
52:26 life
52:27 and you're like I'm conscious that I am
52:29 high-strung and I hate it I want to be
52:32 relaxed I want to be cool I want people
52:35 to get that vibe from me you want to
52:38 walk in a room that is in a big argument
52:41 and just your mere existence in the room
52:43 comes everyone down because of a couple
52:45 things one your overall vibe is not that
52:48 and so you start to exude your lower
52:51 frequency it's like when someone is very
52:53 stressed out and they get into a pool of
52:55 water one that is not chaotic like a
52:57 jacuzzi but one it's like a lake and you
53:01 sit on that noodle and you go up to your
53:02 neck and the water and you're just
53:04 chilling with your friends maybe
53:06 drinking a beer or whatever you start to
53:09 have all of the stress of life pulled
53:11 away from you and there's an amazing
53:12 beautiful thing when you put your head
53:13 underneath water
53:15 farling any length of time you start to
53:17 calm down because it's your all of your
53:19 tensions up here in your head so where
53:22 your thoughts are right and it just
53:25 overwhelms you it's low frequency sine
53:28 wave of energy within the water is all
53:31 around you and it believe me it's boss
53:33 right here inside some gazillion tank
53:36 Lake it's gonna win and it's a beautiful
53:39 thing which is why visiting lakes can be
53:41 very therapeutic if you're doing jet
53:44 skiing and skiing and doing a bunch of
53:46 activities it's quite the opposite right
53:49 but the second thing that will occur
53:51 when you walk into a room when you are
53:53 known for being this sort of calm soul
53:55 is in the subconscious or even the
53:58 consciousness of people in the room who
54:00 especially if they know you they will
54:03 inadvertently subconsciously say okay
54:07 he's here she's here we can't behave
54:10 around this person like we are behaving
54:13 part of it's because they they say we
54:15 don't want to be seen by this person
54:16 behaving in an immature manner it's very
54:20 powerful sometimes I've had this happen
54:24 to me several times I'll walk into a
54:26 room and there's a very intense debate
54:28 going on people are just on the edge of
54:30 being heated if not already being heated
54:32 and some of the room will know me really
54:34 really well or all of them will and
54:36 they'll say oh my god you're here we
54:42 have a debate going on I believe this
54:45 they believe that resolve this for us
54:49 make us both feel good it's kind of what
54:52 they're saying right and in most cases
54:56 I'm capable of getting in there and
54:58 listening and even if I even if I hear
55:05 someone who I think is according to my
55:07 bias opinion is completely off-base I
55:10 understand that they're human being with
55:12 feelings and the last thing they want to
55:15 experience in this room is me confirming
55:18 that they're wrong right which is not
55:20 really the case my bias that disagrees
55:22 and so I will wordsmith my reply to give
55:27 everyone credit for thinking
55:28 for one for being passionate about a
55:30 solution you know a very easy one that
55:35 you'll bump into every once in a while
55:36 and I have them up into this for a long
55:37 time but it's a good example for this
55:38 episode is two or three people arguing
55:42 over I was gonna say world peace but
55:45 let's go after just politics in general
55:48 the common denominator for all people
55:51 when you put them in a room even
55:53 religious people is that they are their
55:57 goal typically if they're not some
55:59 Neanderthal hanging on to Sharia law or
56:02 some [ __ ] yeah we're gonna always
56:05 keep that in a [ __ ] is that they
56:08 typically want the world to be a
56:09 wonderful place that's what they really
56:11 want they just simply disagree about the
56:14 methodology to get there some people
56:16 will believe that the idealistic
56:20 definition of socialism is fantastic we
56:22 all share the spoils of the world and of
56:25 course theoretically speaking it works
56:27 great but the problem is there's always
56:29 some absolute corrupted power person at
56:32 the top hidden away and they will
56:36 manipulate the strings to make sure that
56:39 they are disproportionately rewarded for
56:42 being in that position but the layman
56:46 people that we run into right the normal
56:48 human beings and I used to think laymen
56:50 was a was an insult fact I was proofing
56:55 a document in the early 90s once and
56:57 someone used the word layman's and I
57:00 they were asking me for edits on the
57:01 article and I said well I think it
57:03 layman's is sort of a an insult and it
57:06 was just that I was so amid sure about
57:07 language that I didn't realize that that
57:09 actually has no bias really it's just
57:11 saying look if you don't know anything
57:13 about this this is how it works that's
57:15 all they were saying so you could
57:20 acknowledge everyone's desire to make
57:22 the world a wonderful place and simply
57:24 say well I'm going to acknowledge and
57:30 the person who perhaps let's just use
57:32 this as an example because I've had this
57:33 conversation before but the one about
57:35 socialism and you say look I understand
57:39 socialism and the theory of it on paper
57:42 it is
57:43 you fool you are correct and if we could
57:45 ever get everyone to think the same way
57:48 socialism could be the way the world
57:49 works it's sort of the same theory with
57:51 we could get rid of all the guns but if
57:55 and if the whole world doesn't do it and
57:57 gets rid of ballistic missiles and
57:59 nuclear bombs and everything else that's
58:00 a weapon tanks and everything then it's
58:05 not going to work for now we all have to
58:09 have a Second Amendment we all do all of
58:12 you Europeans people that are watching
58:15 you do have to get back your guns you do
58:19 because we are not remotely mature
58:21 enough to live in a world without them
58:24 in terms of just defending ourselves
58:26 against tyrannical governments if you
58:29 haven't been convinced the EU as a
58:31 tyrannical body run by the Arab
58:33 Brotherhood then you're not paying
58:35 attention it's a sad fact it's a sad
58:38 fact that there are shadow agencies that
58:42 believe in genocide and extermination of
58:44 pretty much everyone the world that
58:46 isn't them they write it on their
58:48 websites you can just read it you don't
58:50 have to debate it at least they're being
58:55 honest with us and they're publicized
58:57 materials just like Malcolm X said I'd
59:01 rather have a guy tell me he thinks I'm
59:02 a in word to my face than someone who's
59:05 pretending to be my friend when they
59:08 hate me but let's go back to the overall
59:11 theme of this episode the first comments
59:13 I made in this episode to wrap it up
59:15 here okay what if we did participate in
59:20 a very active way in the reality that we
59:23 have created what if it is us that
59:27 manifests the antagonist the non-player
59:29 characters that is our universe how do
59:33 we manifest goodness and how do we
59:36 retract badness how do we clean up the
59:40 mess of people that are long gone right
59:43 what if for 50 years the baby boomers
59:48 through all kinds of agendas the
59:51 feminist agenda which again convinced
59:53 all these women that they didn't have
59:54 jobs before nineteen
59:56 eighty before the movie nine-to-five
59:59 came out all women were repressed and
60:01 beaten and didn't do anything right it's
60:03 it's ridiculous go watch the show
60:05 what's my line I'm gonna do a whole
60:06 episode on what's my line and we will
60:08 prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that
60:11 women were powerful and amazing forever
60:14 okay yes we needed to fight over the
60:19 right to vote and bring them into the
60:21 fold of how society worked but in terms
60:23 of women working it was different right
60:25 how do we make this world a better place
60:31 well if our consciousness and
60:34 subconsciousness participates in the
60:37 creation of reality for us individually
60:39 and then thus us as a society right
60:42 getting you know from a person in a home
60:45 to the neighborhood to the town to the
60:47 state to the country to the world then
60:51 we have to do everything in our power to
60:53 focus on the emotions that we would love
60:56 to swim inside of right positivity it's
61:01 a feedback loop it is a feedback loop of
61:04 our thoughts the observed reality
61:09 episode is extremely important as a
61:10 personal primer for you to understand
61:13 that everything that you see inside your
61:15 mind is not your thoughts and therefore
61:18 you do not need to ask for help
61:22 necessarily and repelling thoughts that
61:25 you don't believe have anything to do
61:27 with your reality you can reject that
61:29 yourself by yourself now you can ask for
61:32 help if you like from the universe and
61:34 it will provide it will but you can own
61:41 a gun in your house and never think
61:45 about it never think about it when
61:49 something happens to you that angers you
61:50 you have a choice of how you respond and
61:53 I would say that if you respond
61:56 negatively and again some stuff is
61:58 really bad okay if you can't get away
62:01 from it it's being forced upon you then
62:06 you can choose to deal with it a number
62:09 of ways
62:10 my wisdom that I would like to share
62:13 with you that I have obviously taken
62:16 from others is try to choose
62:23 method by which you don't have to
62:24 demonize the situation in a way that it
62:27 manifests even larger you don't want a
62:30 negative situation that is a unit one
62:32 and respond to it to the point you
62:35 augmented to unit five but out of a one
62:38 through five scale right you don't want
62:40 to go up to a massive level of severity
62:42 in your life such that you're like well
62:45 it was bad and I just made it worse now
62:47 we all human beings we all do this right
62:49 someone will anger you and you're not
62:52 ready for it you had a great day and all
62:55 of a sudden you come home or you go to
62:56 work or whatever and you're surprised by
62:59 something and it shocks you and it takes
63:03 time to calm down and cool off hopefully
63:05 your wound easy heal fast kind of person
63:06 like myself but sometimes that won't
63:08 easy can be embarrassing and your
63:10 responses to others most of you have
63:13 realized that those that cause these
63:15 problems for you well they don't want to
63:19 take responsibility for it and again
63:20 like Iago and a fellow they don't
63:24 perceive themselves as being a problem
63:26 you have to almost convince them that
63:29 this is a problem they've created for
63:31 you it's great for them it's not great
63:33 for you it hurts you hurt you
63:36 emotionally perhaps physically whatever
63:40 that's where you have to make decisions
63:42 about who's in your life what's in your
63:45 life such that you can live a full
63:47 beautiful rich life where you get what
63:52 you want in life and you get what you
63:53 need in life but you're out of this
63:56 manifestation that is creating negative
64:01 thoughts for you that then Medifast
64:04 into reality even if there is no
64:08 participation of man in this reality
64:10 which I don't believe is the case but
64:13 even if it were just an illusion created
64:16 by a bunch of bad history someone
64:18 misquoted starwars and so even the
64:20 actors that participated in the creation
64:22 in the movie for 35 years completely got
64:24 it wrong
64:26 you realize that it's been 38 years
64:29 since 10 20 30 yeah 38 years since
64:35 Empire the strikes back
64:36 happened and James Earl Jones will still
64:39 reference Luke I'm your father Luke Mark
64:43 Hamill Luke Skywalker still thinks it's
64:47 Luke I'm your father those are the two
64:51 individuals who spoke the lines and it
64:54 changed hmm it's pretty hard to say that
64:58 they would that we're all just having
65:00 this sort of bad history moment right
65:03 well you know everyone thought Eli
65:04 Whitney was a black guy for I don't know
65:07 a hundred years and recently it's a
65:09 white guy from you a guy that never
65:12 picked cotton in his life had the
65:14 epiphany about how to create a machine
65:16 to pick cotton right it's just hilarious
65:19 right doesn't make any sense logically
65:21 but even if we don't participate we know
65:24 that when you're around people who are
65:27 happy it's pretty hard to be bummed out
65:31 unless you're envious but if you ever
65:35 bump into someone that has something
65:36 that you want instead of hating them and
65:40 being envious make friends with them
65:46 use all of your skills to make friends
65:48 with them and figure out if you can't be
65:50 friends with them because you never are
65:51 going to meet them you like someone
65:53 who's a celebrity or a business person
65:54 or whatever study them study how they
65:57 got where they where they are today and
65:59 you'll find it's a lot of hard work most
66:01 the time
66:02 very few people fall a pill to those
66:04 levels sometimes it happens some people
66:07 in the right place at the right time but
66:08 those that's like trying to win a
66:11 lottery by hanging out with the people
66:13 that want a lottery ticket it doesn't
66:14 help you win at all it's random yeah
66:17 very few of you probably do that I know
66:21 you feel me but sometimes we have to
66:23 have things repeated to us to remember
66:26 if a self-help course worked in the
66:32 following way then no one none of us
66:34 would have any problems let's say that
66:37 Tony Robbins touched all of us his
66:41 techniques simply worked they work for
66:45 me
66:45 they made me largely Who I am today at
66:49 some level some double-digit percentage
66:52 not 50 percent probably but he'll
66:55 wouldn't you take 15 percent improvement
66:56 if you could right I have no affiliation
66:59 with that guy whatsoever
67:00 not even today is kind of weird but we
67:04 get we could just listen to self-help
67:06 lessons watch a YouTube video we could
67:10 read a book we can listen to audio
67:11 recordings of these folks telling us how
67:14 the life our life can be great and how
67:16 it works and we'd all be fixed because
67:19 you only need to hear at one time we
67:22 know that's not the case we were
67:25 idealistic once as children and we knew
67:27 that at 13 if we picked up that guitar
67:29 and we practice for four years by 17
67:33 we'd be a master at it by 18 we'd have a
67:35 career in it and we probably would not
67:37 feel like we were working ever again in
67:40 our lives but what happens why don't you
67:43 pick up the guitar why don't you have
67:45 that regiment or that reward I should
67:48 say
67:51 because life happens it distracts you
67:54 kids with cell phones today holy [ __ ] if
67:57 you have a kid who's a gens e edge in
68:02 whatever the hell they're going to call
68:03 it after that and they're able to create
68:06 a career they're able to develop a trade
68:09 skill they're able to work in the real
68:11 world and they're able to become
68:14 self-employed at some point I'm gonna
68:17 say that they have fought more demons
68:19 than you and I over 40 have ever fought
68:21 in our existence unless we self-imposed
68:24 the the challenge on ourselves because
68:28 there are so many distractions for kids
68:30 today as a parent today you could look
68:34 at a kid even if it's not yours and
68:35 simply especially if it's not yours our
68:37 part listen to you a little bit more and
68:39 you could say something to the effect of
68:43 well you got a choice kid you could
68:48 spend your whole youth inside that phone
68:50 pertaining to have friends that you
68:52 really don't have maybe if the kids are
68:55 into video games which isn't a big thing
68:57 now you could liken that as well but you
69:01 can say to that kid well you can stay in
69:04 that if you want but at 18 you're gonna
69:07 have to figure out what you're gonna do
69:09 with your life and if you want to go to
69:10 college and you have no inkling of who
69:13 you are and what you like in life
69:14 because you didn't use your teenage
69:16 years to figure out the trade skill that
69:18 you're actually interested in then you
69:22 may never ever enjoy a life that is
69:26 yours you will work for someone else and
69:30 someone else will be the dreamer and
69:31 someone else will tell you what to do
69:33 and even if it's something wonderful you
69:35 might still spite it because it's not
69:38 your idea
69:39 you will feel deep down inside the
69:41 genetics of your ancestors who did have
69:43 such opportunities if you have a family
69:45 of doctors you will be frustrated to
69:48 visit a doctor because you're thinking
69:49 inside your soul I should be the one
69:51 figuring out the solution here I
69:53 shouldn't have to pay money to someone
69:55 else if your family's full of musicians
69:58 you might think Jesus I should have been
69:59 the one writing the song it's on the
70:01 radio because I hate the [ __ ] that's on
70:02 the radio
70:03 and kid you'd be right you'd be right
70:06 you should have been the doctor you
70:07 should have been the scientist it should
70:09 have been the musician or whatever but
70:12 you jumped inside your telephone and you
70:16 threw your life away it's not your fault
70:18 necessarily it was given to you as a
70:20 baby to pacify you so mommy and daddy
70:23 could watch you know the next gory
70:27 Walking Dead episode but some of you are
70:31 aunts and uncles you are grandparents
70:34 too really young kids and you can
70:36 influence them you can drop that mad
70:39 science on them right man I tell you if
70:43 you watch every single episode I have
70:45 told you about several of the moments
70:47 when wise men and women looked at me in
70:51 that way that says this is a
70:55 make-or-break moment kid how you
70:57 interpret what I'm about to say is going
71:00 to control your destiny and they don't
71:04 have to say listen up they don't have to
71:05 say pay attention kid listen to me boy
71:07 I'm talking to you they don't have to
71:09 say that it's just that moment because
71:11 they're not my parent I wasn't really a
71:14 rebellious kid against my parents but if
71:16 you know that that stupid archetype that
71:19 goes on all the time but I listened and
71:22 it changed my life
71:25 they had a perspective you can be one of
71:29 those people be cool
71:31 they'll be confrontational try not to
71:33 take a [ __ ] on someone else in order to
71:36 make your point just lay out the options
71:39 you're why souls you wouldn't be here if
71:44 you weren't like I say in previous
71:46 episodes our genetics are phenomenal
71:48 it's how we got to this point but the
71:52 ruling class of this world and the
71:55 sellouts that worship them for a
71:57 short-term paycheck they are trying to
72:00 stifle your genetic line from becoming
72:04 anything in life so they all become
72:05 serfs they all become slaves all the
72:09 time professing they're anything but
72:11 kids don't think anything should be
72:13 difficult in life at this point
72:17 I think everything should just be handed
72:18 to them on a socialistic platter which
72:20 is why certain political parties in the
72:23 United States of America draw a lot of a
72:25 lot of praise I would say that's why
72:28 they able to get a single vote as
72:30 they're saying I know we [ __ ] up your
72:32 entire life
72:32 and so socialism is your only way out by
72:37 no means is it the only way out
72:39 spread the fruits of your wisdom realize
72:43 that you know the youth of this world
72:46 and even some of the adults they will
72:51 sometimes reject you to your face but
72:54 they have heard every word that you've
72:55 said and they will keep it in their
72:58 quiver for when times go bad and they'll
73:02 look over their shoulder to make sure
73:03 you're not watching and they'll pull
73:06 your arrow out lock it
73:09 knock it fire it and win and the second
73:13 that happens the second day at the
73:14 bullseye of life based on something you
73:17 said everything else you've ever told
73:20 them will go from the storage container
73:24 in their brain marked that son of a
73:27 [ __ ] he told me how to live my life
73:28 it'll be unwrapped push completely to
73:31 the front and it will be we're gonna
73:33 live our life by these rules well study
73:36 them to make sure they work but this is
73:39 our new way I think that's it if you
73:44 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
73:45 that's where you get all the feeds
73:47 there's audio there's video there's a
73:50 lakh Facebook group and there's a
73:51 patreon page I am posting patreon

74:01 tried to give the seven people on
74:04 patreon the chance to see things first
74:07 so get in there if you dig it take care
