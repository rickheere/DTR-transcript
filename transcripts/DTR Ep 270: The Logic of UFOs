00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen so you know I've covered the
00:40 UFO thing and the alien thing from
00:42 several different angles and I can't
00:45 shake it it's an interesting topic to me
00:52 recently bought a UFO rag which i
00:56 mentioned in previous episode and read
00:58 through it and sort of there's like I
01:02 get a bunch of unresolved issues with
01:04 how we're viewing this like I'll read a
01:06 bunch of articles in a row like a whole
01:08 magazine on to our flight and I can't
01:12 shake the fact that there's like this
01:15 underlying psychosis that we have with
01:18 aliens and UFOs and what was really
01:21 interesting was that the magazine was
01:26 essentially living in the past like I
01:29 said in my last UFO episode which I
01:31 forgot what I called it but it was all
01:32 about the fact that in the modern era
01:34 with cameras the death of these UFO
01:37 messiahs is starting to happen which is
01:39 what happened when Christ the story of
01:41 Christ was able to get into our brains
01:44 before the printing press once the
01:46 printing press came around we started
01:47 documenting history better and then all
01:49 sudden tall tales started to slow down a
01:52 little bit as video came into action
01:57 everyone got their cell phones man it's
01:59 tough and all the UFO studies we see
02:01 today are basically art students
02:03 creating their demo reel for special
02:06 effects and composite work and that's
02:09 why they're always the same these days
02:10 right a shaky camera with UFO glowing
02:13 behind
02:14 a skyscraper and coming back out and pop
02:16 them back out and it's it's always the
02:18 same so that's sort of like some
02:20 low-hanging fruit things we can talk
02:22 about that I already have talked about
02:23 right so I'm not gonna mention him here
02:26 this episode is gonna be called the
02:29 logic of UFOs which really kind of gets
02:33 at the logic of aliens in general and it
02:36 sort of goes along the line of this
02:39 logic what if someone told you that at a
02:41 point in history everyone was killed in
02:46 a particular region of the world for a
02:47 particular reason but there sure seems
02:51 to be a lot of survivors telling you
02:54 about that story when everyone died and
02:57 you're like oh that seems like a logic
02:59 problem here there's plenty of people
03:02 that are always alive that are survivors
03:05 from this era and this place where
03:07 everybody was killed more people than
03:09 are even recorded in history having
03:11 lived there this has happened several
03:14 times in history how does that apply to
03:16 aliens UFOs well it splits down the
03:23 center because you either believe what
03:27 arthur c clarke kept going in his books
03:31 which which was that we should assume
03:33 that aliens are very empathetic to us
03:36 and that they wouldn't be able to gain
03:38 such interstellar travel / mechanism
03:43 being evil being careless with their
03:49 vehicles now doesn't mean the aliens are
03:52 all of a sudden perfect because they
03:54 have achieved interstellar travel does
03:56 that mean they won't take a beta ship
03:58 out there and fly it and crash it in
04:00 roswell new mexico in 47 yeah maybe
04:04 maybe not what if we took all of our
04:08 technology to another planet like we
04:11 took we looked at it through a telescope
04:13 when we said oh they have swimming
04:15 oceans and from our readings the oceans
04:18 are made of water and so we bring all of
04:22 our ships there and we don't realize
04:25 something else about the water
04:27 it doesn't behave like our water the
04:30 gravity's too strong the whole
04:31 displacement algorithm of staying afloat
04:34 doesn't work and everything sinks to the
04:36 bottom of the ocean or there's an acidic
04:38 cloud that happens every morning and it
04:41 just eats up our ships and our people
04:44 and then we're able to get there and
04:46 we're able to put a boat in the water
04:47 but the locals are like didn't you think
04:51 about the acid cloud that comes out
04:52 every morning from the bowels of the
04:54 earth bowels of their planet whatever
04:57 some mistakes can happen I guess there's
05:01 usually kind of three different types of
05:04 encounters that are always documented
05:06 one a UFO sighting something in the sky
05:08 someone takes a photograph something
05:10 looks like a hubcap son that looks like
05:12 a lot like some toys that have been made
05:15 and then you have the alien sighting you
05:22 see an alien you see aliens you maybe
05:24 even communicate with them and then you
05:27 have the abduction they take some human
05:30 with them for an evening for you know a
05:35 year or a lifetime they simply disappear
05:38 the magazine I push through every single
05:43 article is about past encounters every
05:47 single one of them as if the jig is up
05:48 and the only thing they can do is
05:50 reminisce a part of me is sad sad that
05:58 that's the case oh man did cellphones
06:00 kill this myth that is UFOs I mean
06:03 everything that flies it's unidentifieds
06:05 a UFO so the military will definitely
06:06 keep us busy you know area 51 and
06:10 wright-patterson Air Force Base and a
06:12 few other locations we're talking about
06:14 the real deal real aliens but when I
06:18 apply logic to the sightings and logic
06:21 to the claims it starts to fall apart
06:24 but we seem to have these eyewitness
06:27 testimonies some of which were self
06:31 recorded in the 90s some a part of
06:34 project disclosure with dr. Steven Greer
06:39 and again a lot of those fell apart
06:40 really really fast I think about 95% of
06:43 the video testimony from Stephen Greer's
06:46 project it can be easily picked apart
06:51 and I don't say that with any hey I'm so
06:53 smart I'm a brilliant skeptic I don't
06:57 want personally to be able to pick them
06:59 apart but the 5% that are left I think
07:02 are very convincing they're great
07:06 whoever's these people are they believe
07:09 what they saw as being real and again
07:14 there could be military things and there
07:16 could be UFO things alien things about
07:21 30% of this magazine had articles about
07:24 people that saw UFOs that were injured
07:27 by them the exhaust systems burned them
07:31 gave them cancer some cases they died
07:34 some cases they just had scar tissue and
07:37 that begs the question do our alien
07:41 friends not know the fragility of man
07:44 are they just running around with these
07:46 giant thrusters you know here comes a
07:49 bee leak yeah well whatever what do we
07:51 care fry it you know take out we have to
07:54 get out of here we have to maneuver
07:55 we've been seen and there's no empathy
07:57 empathy towards exposing people to
08:00 violent bursts of radiation heat they
08:06 just willy-nilly go around we're just
08:07 cattle we're gonna go down that line
08:12 here the logic of UFOs now in the
08:16 history books of mankind we know of
08:18 several societies that have matured to a
08:21 point where war had pretty much been
08:23 vanquished from their geographical
08:26 region they didn't spend time making
08:29 weapons until [ __ ] more primitive
08:35 with the whole world at their at their
08:38 fingertips decided to grab someone
08:40 else's piece of land you know the haves
08:42 and have-nots thing right I see you have
08:44 a nice lush piece of Earth I want that
08:47 let's fight there are so many stories of
08:50 aliens
08:52 being demons and being bad people
08:54 enslaving man the whole theme of the
08:58 Planet X thing was involved with this
09:02 theory that Planet X swings by every
09:05 once a while and you know they they have
09:09 plenty of technology to fly from their
09:12 planet to our planet but they don't have
09:14 fusion to create as much gold as they
09:16 want so they enslaved us to dig out all
09:19 the gold because they need to put it in
09:22 their atmosphere to save themselves from
09:25 their Sun that's going you know a little
09:28 crazy although we can we can't see it
09:30 you know nemesis which was the star
09:33 Nibiru
09:34 being the planet they have so much
09:37 technology that they're able to come
09:38 here and engineer mankind with their own
09:41 DNA with other DNA and get it done
09:44 lickety-split right because they're only
09:45 here for one inner orbit of their little
09:48 sub solar system but now we've seen the
09:51 full cycle of Planet X they have
09:56 predicted at least four times in the
09:58 last four years this is all going down a
10:00 bunch of meteorites are gonna crash into
10:03 Scotland and Europe and just wreak havoc
10:05 on the world we're gonna get displaced
10:07 from our orbit with the Sun and duh but
10:11 nothing ever happens not even close
10:14 it's sort of like our definition of God
10:18 God is very man-made within all
10:22 organized religions isn't he he gets
10:24 angry like a little kid because he can't
10:26 predict anything you can't see what's
10:28 gonna happen
10:29 you ate from that tree aliens are sort
10:33 of bumbling idiots if you were to
10:35 combine all the stories that we hear
10:38 about and I you know there's an
10:40 exceptions to it they always seem to
10:44 meet with the military-industrial
10:45 complex of whatever country they're over
10:48 they never meet with the citizens - a
10:50 French guy meeting an alien in a crater
10:55 over and over whitley strieber
10:58 as a very personal relationship with i
11:02 don't know hundreds and hundreds of
11:03 aliens and yet he hasn't become the
11:06 Bassitt urbe tween us and this race i
11:09 think that logic is a real basic thing
11:12 to use when you have a claim on your
11:15 hands right I remember watching a bunch
11:18 of UFO specials on the sci-fi channel in
11:21 the 90s and the early 2000s and at the
11:25 conclusion of every show was that warm
11:27 message slash interview question do you
11:32 think we will ever like there ever gonna
11:34 come and in bulk and say hello and it
11:38 was always a very wishful positive
11:41 message yes I think within the next five
11:43 years I think within the next ten years
11:44 and it probably is a very innocent
11:48 answer because if you inundate yourself
11:51 with all this all the claims and you're
11:53 processing claim after claim after claim
11:56 especially if you're unable to resolve
11:58 all the claims and and you know map it
12:00 to the Aurora project or something else
12:03 you start to get the feeling that these
12:05 things are very real but one thing this
12:08 magazine did to its merit was that it
12:11 talked about the fact that once someone
12:14 said flying saucer and you had the claim
12:20 of Roswell you also had some B movies
12:22 come out especially the Day the Earth
12:23 Stood Still these sightings of saucer
12:28 shape vehicles blew up and so there's a
12:32 couple ways to look at that the magazine
12:35 didn't take this latter example I'm
12:37 going to give to my knowledge but the
12:39 first example I gave was that people
12:42 wanted to be a part of something special
12:44 maybe want to make some money you know
12:47 farmers just in case you haven't been in
12:50 the Midwest of Kansas or or the United
12:53 States of America in general it's all
12:55 over Kansas these guys have skills and
12:58 they will weld all these crazy insects
13:02 and bulls and horses and all these
13:05 sculptures out of scrap metal one guy
13:08 does it up bumpers will make big giant
13:11 giant 25-foot tall praying mantises when
13:14 you drive by their property see all
13:16 these amazing sculptures it's beautiful
13:18 it's amazing it's cool
13:20 but you don't think they could take a
13:23 rotary from a disk from from a brake
13:27 system or a hubcap or some other
13:29 circular object and start tinkering with
13:32 it and tinkering with it come up with
13:34 some catapult toss it take a picture of
13:37 it you know as those famous photographs
13:40 of saucers out of the 50s people took
13:44 pictures of and then you would see them
13:45 on sci-fi specials and the funny thing
13:49 is that they would tell you oh my god we
13:50 have brought in photographic experts to
13:54 look at this and they do all these
13:57 calculations on the photograph and we
13:59 these people have determined that this
14:01 is authentic that this ship this thing
14:04 you see in this photograph which looks
14:05 about the size of a hubcap is definitely
14:09 at least 30 feet wide or a hundred feet
14:12 wide well with today's knowledge in
14:15 today's Photoshop in today's 3d print
14:18 packages we have out there and the
14:19 general understanding of light for any
14:22 artist we can look at these photographs
14:25 and say okay it's not hanging from a
14:27 string that much we can hike on and
14:29 figure out but there's no way of
14:33 determining its diameter there's no way
14:36 of determining its its distance from the
14:38 camera there's no light sourcing
14:42 information from the day that would let
14:44 us know one thing or the other about
14:46 this thing and so they were completely
14:48 blowing smoke up their own ass and then
14:51 broadcasting it on TV to create a story
14:54 hey it was it Rupert in the 70s I think
15:00 what was it he he bought the fake
15:02 diaries of Adolf Hitler and published
15:05 him in his paper keeping all the experts
15:08 away from the Diaries to determine
15:10 whether or not they were fake or real
15:11 and they're full of just absolute crap
15:14 well the dog he took a poop in the front
15:16 room oh my god it smells here and I
15:18 stepped in it and just stupid stuff and
15:20 you know within 48 hours of publishing
15:23 these Diaries in the newspaper and
15:25 sewing three to four times the amount of
15:27 units of his newspaper they were deemed
15:30 fake
15:31 the most telling thing was that an F I
15:35 believe was used on the front of the
15:38 book was FH instead of a H because the
15:44 guy who was forging it didn't know
15:45 anything about calligraphy and the more
15:48 gothic German calligraphy and thought
15:50 the F wasn't a pretty funny right but
15:56 historians got in there and applied
15:57 logic and said this [ __ ] is fake there's
16:01 a bunch of different religions about
16:03 aliens and UFOs right where do they come
16:07 from a long time ago I'd say 30-plus
16:12 years ago and then everything back
16:14 before that up until maybe like you know
16:17 in the beginning of the 20th century
16:20 they were always coming in from a
16:22 different planet right the little green
16:24 man theory more recently as we have
16:28 matured scientifically and developed
16:31 theoretical models of quote-unquote
16:35 dimensions now the big thing is they're
16:38 interdimensional though they're always
16:40 here they're always here or on us but
16:43 they just vibrate out of our visual
16:45 frequency and so we can't see them
16:46 that's our new theory it's romantic it's
16:50 cool and it reads the entire movement
16:52 and hey people like me are very
16:56 entertained by it absolutely out of
16:59 everything that you could wake up in the
17:01 morning and believe or be told or
17:03 discover by walking at your front door
17:06 the Second Coming is probably the top
17:08 one the angels are falling out of the
17:11 sky it's not a son anymore it's a
17:14 glowing crucifix Jesus says what's up
17:20 man
17:20 I'll be right back but this second one
17:24 to the Second Coming if you're a
17:26 Christian would be the alien invasion
17:29 Verner von braun as you guys all know he
17:34 dies I believe in 1978-79 somewhere in
17:37 there
17:37 and his secretary pops out of nowhere a
17:40 very cosmic looking woman and she says
17:45 you know he used to lecture me about the
17:48 fact that the government has been
17:49 planning ever since they were able to
17:51 kind of master spacecraft of any kind
17:53 meaning not airplanes rocketry and other
17:58 propulsion systems that they were going
18:00 to try and fake the invasion of aliens
18:03 from another planet I got a whole
18:05 episode on this and so it leaves anyone
18:11 who hears that theory really in three
18:13 positions one you hate the fact that
18:18 this might happen you don't believe this
18:21 is ever gonna happen or you'd really
18:24 like to see it even if it's fake because
18:26 it'd be damned show me show me how
18:28 you're gonna pull this off I want to see
18:30 all kinds of wild anti-gravity vehicles
18:32 flying around if you managed to
18:34 crossbreed some human alien there's that
18:37 human alien but human animal thing that
18:39 looks like a gray I'd be cool too maybe
18:42 I'm completely wrong about artificial
18:44 intelligence and oh my god they've
18:45 cracked the nut of the human
18:47 consciousness and they're able just to
18:49 manufacture these little robots I don't
18:52 know Bart part of me just wants to see
18:55 it happen just to see the technology
18:57 right I want to walk right up to one of
18:59 these aliens and look at him and check
19:01 his whole body out and say hi and see if
19:03 he talks back to me and you know does he
19:05 want to meet my leader does you want a
19:07 chocolate sundae whatever we'll take
19:09 care of him right maybe it'll be like
19:11 Tim Burton's invasion from Mars a mars
19:16 invasion or whatever it is and we'll
19:17 just start you know yelling ack ack and
19:20 then shoot us then we'll have to find
19:23 that song right play our harmonicas but
19:27 imagine getting in one of these vehicles
19:28 and you're like wow they've been farming
19:31 these things out of s4 if it's a if it's
19:34 an artificial invasion get inside you
19:36 start a lose track of time maybe get a
19:38 little pukey like Tommyknockers from
19:40 Stephen King but then there's the aliens
19:44 you know and this magazine covered about
19:46 half a dozen of the various aliens the
19:48 greys the beige which are like greys but
19:51 taller I've always been taught by
19:53 Whitley Strieber that the beiges are the
19:55 females and the blues
19:56 are the or the greys are the male's you
19:59 study a lot of animals that's definitely
20:01 the way it is in the animal kingdom the
20:03 males are much shorter look at the Queen
20:06 brood of an anthill then you have your
20:10 reptilians then you have your reptilian
20:12 shapeshifters yeah if your Norwegian
20:15 Aryans the guy in France so as the
20:19 Raelians the are Conan's Anunnaki it's a
20:25 never-ending list and when they did the
20:26 Steven Greer I think it was 2001 or 2002
20:30 somewhere in there big announcement of
20:35 this disclosure project you know they
20:37 had a huge panel of at least 10 maybe 12
20:39 people the press was invited and one by
20:44 one about 30 guys came out the audience
20:46 and went up to the podium and said what
20:48 they were involved in and said they
20:49 would swear you know under oath that
20:51 this is what they experienced you have
20:54 bill Cooper said he experienced his
20:57 thing in the Navy and the 60s like I
21:01 mentioned very recently one of these
21:03 British journalists I believe was a
21:06 female she was asking one of the
21:08 gentlemen on the panel about what these
21:11 aliens look like because he had cut in
21:13 and tried to say this what he did he
21:16 tried to make it as profound as possible
21:18 because marrying just one alien man
21:19 there's like 20 I know of 25 different
21:22 species or something like that number
21:24 are over 25 and this woman was brilliant
21:27 she goes okay what they look like any
21:31 caves she just used a little bit of
21:33 logic well if you know about all these
21:35 aliens and he said he met one at the end
21:37 of a runway of this last person who
21:38 walked up to the podium I believe it was
21:41 the one in Great Britain on one of our
21:42 US bases over there I guess we have US
21:46 bases over there allied base maybe was
21:51 Germany I don't know but she just asked
21:54 him what does it look like and he pauses
21:56 and you can see he is not ready to
21:58 support his line of BS at all he's got a
22:02 problem and then he just says well they
22:04 look like us
22:07 well they look a lot like us well that
22:09 really just takes the the need for a
22:12 description away very quickly doesn't it
22:14 I think what's interesting is for those
22:17 of you who have studied Bob Lazar
22:19 he's the individual that worked at area
22:22 51 and s4 according to him and John Lear
22:27 I've watched lectures of this guy for
22:30 hours and hours and hours and he never
22:32 really says anything terribly profound
22:35 the most profound thing he ever said was
22:37 that we have discovered an element a
22:39 steel that's like in the 160s of atomic
22:43 weight and that when stimulated this
22:46 creates propulsion it creates a warping
22:49 space-time which then can start creating
22:52 a propulsion mechanism by warping I
22:55 think the ether winds around the
22:56 vehicles what he's getting at the Bob
23:00 has been very careful here he is saying
23:03 that he has seen up to nine different
23:04 vehicles he's working on the most
23:06 pristine one and his job is to reverse
23:08 engineer the propulsion system which is
23:10 built out of three to four antimatter
23:12 engines depending on which discussion
23:15 you hear him talk about but he has said
23:19 he has never seen an alien John Lear
23:24 says that he was presented a gray
23:28 through a door that Bob was taken down a
23:31 hallway he looked through one of those
23:32 little tiny doors with the hazard glass
23:34 you know and he looked in there and
23:37 there was a human in a lab coat and a
23:39 gray next to him and he was smart enough
23:41 to say it didn't move I think this might
23:44 have been a doll or this might have been
23:46 some experiment on me more than on
23:48 anything else do you believe this is
23:50 real now you would think that if it was
23:52 real and it was some survivor of one of
23:55 these crash vehicles maybe they live a
23:56 long time like elves or something that
24:00 it would have been sort of a hey you
24:02 know what you work on all these aliens
24:04 or alien vehicles you should really see
24:06 one because you know you should just
24:08 just we can get you back there he didn't
24:11 say that at all but he was wise enough
24:13 to not step into that realm of oh yeah I
24:16 totally know aliens and I've talked to
24:17 them and ed it up because then he has to
24:19 explain it
24:20 and he's been explaining this stuff for
24:22 nearly 30 years all this other stuff
24:24 again according to Jim or John layer
24:27 excuse me he has said that he is
24:29 he believes that Bob is back there
24:31 working on this stuff but now going back
24:35 to the theme of the episode the logic of
24:37 it all this is what's bothering me part
24:40 of it has to do with if there are so
24:41 many freaking aliens visiting us
24:43 constantly according to all the
24:45 sightings and especially the abductions
24:48 and the Close Encounters of the Third
24:50 Kind kind of stuff where are they why
24:56 you know why don't all of us have a
24:59 friend who has been abducted or had a
25:02 really close encounter I mean a really
25:04 good one I had that weird thing at
25:05 Christmas I talked about her once a
25:07 while so I won't repeat on the show but
25:09 I was in some dreamy kind of weird
25:12 melancholy state I'm not sure I was
25:14 really awake or if I was in a dream so I
25:18 certainly won't tell you that I've ever
25:20 met one and I haven't anything since
25:22 like that I don't think I've ever met
25:23 one the most that's ever happened to me
25:26 is waking up in a sleep paralysis where
25:29 I can barely move and I have this
25:30 feeling that one is over me
25:32 some being is over me it doesn't feel
25:34 human but that's probably me it's living
25:39 a little bit in the twilight zone
25:40 I'm paralyzed because I'm in that
25:42 chemical state where that happens to you
25:45 when you dream if we weren't paralyzed
25:50 during dreaming then every single
25:52 movement we made in our dreams would
25:53 probably move our bodies as well and you
25:55 know what happens with some people
25:57 there's the cute little videos of the
25:59 dogs that kick their legs you know if
26:02 alien spaceships are so carefree about
26:05 our well-being they're willing to burn a
26:07 couple you know driving down the highway
26:10 in some remote area doesn't sound like
26:13 they give a [ __ ] about us doesn't sound
26:15 like they care if they leave behind
26:17 evidence of their existence so why
26:20 haven't we seen them why don't they fly
26:21 around because this isn't like looking
26:24 for Bigfoot where you might or you know
26:27 my episode one I believe in the season
26:32 was about that
26:34 we're looking for the panda bear
26:37 you know the panda bear is not trying to
26:39 evade us they just lived in a really
26:41 remote area of Japan on this kind of
26:44 remote area people had seen them but you
26:47 know the average white man hadn't seen
26:49 him so for us they were a fable for
26:50 about seven years until Teddy
26:52 Roosevelt's son finds one the one I find
26:56 very interesting is this claim of the
27:01 greys that live or the beige is actually
27:03 that live subterranean to earth and
27:07 there's the gentleman who made the video
27:11 in 1995 at some some gathering and he's
27:14 a lot of you will know him he's the one
27:17 that got injured he said he was digging
27:18 the tunnels for the military creating
27:21 sort of this contingency of government
27:23 things so we have all these tunnels
27:24 underneath the United States of America
27:25 which I very much believe because of the
27:28 patented vehicles that make these things
27:30 have been revealed but supposedly we
27:34 have this sort of feral bizarre race
27:37 that lives underneath the soil of Earth
27:42 the gentlemen ninety-five said when he
27:44 went down there there was a bunch of him
27:46 he was down there with some special
27:48 forces a guy who had a big machine gun
27:50 on his chest and he saw them and freaked
27:52 out and he tried to shoot some of them
27:54 and the guy said he shot up some with
27:57 his derringer or whatever the hell it
27:58 was and they put a hand over their chest
28:01 and a beam came out and killed the guy
28:03 with a machine gun and burned and
28:05 electrocuted the guy telling the story
28:08 whose right hand was very mangled in
28:10 real life this guy was murdered
28:13 later that decade before the 90s was out
28:16 he was shot and killed he's a nerd why
28:19 the hell would anyone kill the guy right
28:21 now could there be some weird Sleestak
28:25 that lives in the ground there's the
28:29 show in America I I almost hope you
28:32 didn't get this anywhere else in the
28:33 world but it was called land of the lost
28:34 and it was every morning and on Saturday
28:37 and I remember after the cartoons were
28:40 over this would come on and you know you
28:41 don't want to go out and play just yet
28:43 you don't want to get showered up or
28:44 whatever she's keep watching crap on TV
28:47 and I remember
28:47 in the shown I just didn't like it and
28:49 they were sort of these Grey's +
28:52 reptilian beings that would come out of
28:54 the bowels of the earth and that the
28:58 whole show was set back in the the
29:01 dinosaur era and somehow these sleestaks
29:04 were down there and they're always
29:07 fighting and running from them and
29:08 sometimes people get captured they have
29:10 to go down and find them but I think it
29:14 was just interesting that there's this
29:16 fictional show on TV that turned into a
29:19 real theory for us in the Internet era
29:22 is it based on truth or is it just
29:26 someone evolving this fictional story
29:31 but what on earth would a sophisticated
29:33 society do living underneath the earth
29:36 what are they going to use for food they
29:39 don't have photons to have bio photonics
29:42 to photosynthesize as the skin of the
29:45 greys have said to be which is always
29:49 contrary to the other story about greys
29:52 is that they actually are wearing a
29:53 little spacesuit so they must be the
29:55 permeable to photons but again they're
29:59 traveling in space so where do they get
30:01 this huge supply of you know sunlight or
30:04 they have like little tanning booths up
30:06 inside their vehicles I mean this is
30:08 where when you let a theory of UFOs and
30:11 aliens develop from the organic nature
30:14 of people and when I say let I mean that
30:19 kind of figuratively you will get all
30:22 these contradictions and then you have
30:25 to kind of siphon through it and you
30:27 either go at it from a disinformation
30:29 feeling which is like okay one of these
30:31 stories is true maybe even a dozen or
30:34 these are true but the other hundred the
30:36 other thousand the other ten thousand
30:37 have been injected by copycats from
30:40 society that wish they were involved
30:42 with this really special thing or it's
30:44 some project Majestic some project
30:48 Bluebook it's out there doing it on
30:50 purpose as we've heard supposedly lots
30:53 of testimony and paperwork that has
30:55 claimed to have done such a thing
30:58 the idea is that these UFOs are being
31:01 driven by aliens and they actually have
31:03 some prime directive they're not to
31:05 communicate with us for some reason but
31:09 they're it's okay if they burn all these
31:11 people with their propulsion systems hmm
31:14 it's okay for them to maybe create a
31:16 crop circle and take off it's okay for
31:20 them to set down there was this really
31:22 funny there tripod quad pod vehicles on
31:27 the ground leaving huge depressions in
31:28 the ground this was the funniest thing
31:30 in the 50s this magazine had the
31:33 photograph of a police officer that had
31:35 taken the imprint marks from the vehicle
31:39 and they basically took rocks and just
31:42 surrounded the imprint and it just
31:44 looked like somebody had dug it out with
31:46 a shovel I mean it looked nothing
31:47 interesting but the funny thing is is
31:50 the idea is that they have anti-gravity
31:52 vehicles that can get us get them
31:54 through interstellar regions of space
31:56 but when they land here that
31:59 anti-gravity engines turned off and
32:01 they're super heavy all of a sudden the
32:03 funny thing is is they're not too many
32:05 stories about these crafts landing and
32:07 creating depressions
32:09 on soil but that came about as a result
32:13 I think of a lot of the 50s shows on TV
32:17 where rockets were you know coming down
32:19 like Tesla or like SpaceX rockets and
32:21 landing and taking off a lot of that in
32:23 Twilight Zone right you know Buck Rogers
32:26 had that too in the 30s the logic that
32:31 comes through aside from the death of
32:34 these sightings by means of everyone
32:36 having cameras nowadays and again it's
32:38 not dead it's just really tapered off
32:41 hasn't it
32:42 but our visions of these beings and of
32:47 these vehicles seems to be proportionate
32:49 to our ability to create Hollywood
32:51 imagery of the same thing now some of
32:56 the most boring examples that you might
32:59 cite are these lights in the sky
33:02 you know these strings of lights these
33:04 v-shaped things with lights we have you
33:10 know things over the Capitol building in
33:12 Washington DC
33:14 that flyover you have the Foo Fighters
33:17 flying over Los Angeles during World War
33:21 two right
33:22 you know our enemies had really mastered
33:24 blimp technology and again you know we
33:29 were just getting into powered flight
33:32 and so a lot of engines a lot of
33:35 technology that had been sitting on the
33:36 shelf didn't really have a purpose
33:37 didn't have any money to get research
33:39 was all of a sudden extremely funded
33:41 there's a lot of theories they get
33:43 attached to these black spots and these
33:47 blind spots in history so when there's a
33:49 blind spot in history all kinds of magic
33:52 can happen in there and one of the
33:53 biggest blind spots is what were the
33:55 Nazis really working on you know we're
33:57 gonna overlook the fact that a lot of
33:59 these folks survived lies folks joined
34:02 space programs and you know maybe you
34:05 believe that a lot of that stuff was
34:07 farmed into our space agencies but they
34:12 talk about what the Nazis having bases
34:14 in the South Pole the new theory with
34:18 Flat Earth is that the Nazis were
34:19 looking for the the dome edge if the
34:23 Nazis had found the dome edge I'm
34:24 willing to bet unless it's impenetrable
34:26 Hitler wouldn't have died in 1965 in
34:31 Argentina he would have just left right
34:35 and then you take the logic of what what
34:39 would we do if we were in their shoes if
34:43 we have a prime directive then we
34:46 wouldn't let him see us at all unless
34:48 something like Roswell happened a crash
34:50 but that doesn't account for the
34:53 thousands and thousands of sightings
34:55 that are supposedly been photographed
34:57 and experienced right at some point once
35:01 we have disregard for our contact with
35:04 whomever we're visiting or we believe
35:07 it's their time there would be a plan
35:11 wouldn't there douglas adams who wrote
35:14 The Hitchhiker's Guide at the galaxy
35:16 invented a a group called the teasers
35:20 and Ford Prefect landed on earth in the
35:24 fictional book he said well how'd you
35:26 know Arthur Dent was asking well how'd
35:28 you get to
35:28 in the first place he goes I caught a I
35:30 caught a ride from a teaser we had that
35:34 right he says what's that he goes oh he
35:36 goes this is a bunch of rich kids that
35:38 fly around the universe find really
35:41 obscure areas come out you know they
35:43 land they come out to a farmer wearing
35:45 antennas on their head making meat meat
35:47 noises really childish actually he says
35:51 but that's Douglas Adams looking at the
35:54 logic of this whole thing and saying
35:55 yeah that's about as logical as it is a
35:58 bunch of rich kids playing and toying
36:00 with the belief system of another planet
36:03 as if the parents never show up there's
36:07 a lot of you who have studied the
36:08 deathbed confessions of individuals from
36:09 the government there's even been with
36:11 project disclosure and other projects
36:14 interviews with these old dying guys and
36:18 hospitals and hotels and their homes
36:19 they're on oxygen tanks and they are
36:22 desperately trying to get the
36:24 information out that they liaisons with
36:27 grace and what I do find amazing about
36:31 those confessions and adds a little
36:33 credibility to it is that I don't hear
36:36 those individuals talking about arian
36:39 Norwegian folks with eyes that are a
36:41 little bit far apart and bizarre noses
36:43 they don't talk about reptilians they
36:46 don't talk about beiges they keep it
36:47 straight and narrow Grey's with almond
36:51 eyes shorter skinnier four fingers one
36:55 of them being a thumb that kind of thing
36:58 some of you might be thinking about the
37:00 logic that they are trying to warm us up
37:04 okay so what has happened so far most
37:12 the abductions are not friendly
37:14 abductions most of the sightings are
37:17 either so benign they have very little
37:19 meaning to mankind which would be the
37:22 whole act of warming a sub meaning a
37:26 bunch of lights over Phoenix isn't
37:29 giving anyone any information that is
37:31 imperative it's a bunch of lights
37:32 everyone can debate what they are you
37:35 know the ball lightning coming out of
37:37 the bowels of the desert are they
37:40 military vehicles or whatever it's all
37:42 up for grabs that doesn't really
37:44 progress the thought very much the
37:47 vehicle types are very different right
37:50 all this stuff coming out of various non
37:52 United States military cameras on you
37:57 know inside Russian vehicles and even
37:59 Mexican vehicles and you know like
38:01 fighter jets and stuff and they show
38:02 these videos they're out there like this
38:04 big cylindrical thing that's supposed to
38:05 be three miles long or longer then you
38:10 have the saucers then you have like I
38:11 don't know a hundred different saucers
38:14 warming us up would probably be a fairly
38:16 clear and concise message with a modicum
38:21 of logic to it stage one we do this
38:25 stage two we do that or phase 1 phase 2
38:28 phase 3 we're not really seeing you that
38:33 are we the Close Encounters the human to
38:36 alien interactions well I'm gonna
38:40 suggest okay that in anal probing human
38:44 beings is probably not the actual phase
38:50 of an intelligent being one like I've
38:53 said several times what are you getting
38:55 out of the anal canal of human beings
38:57 that you can't get out of a hair sample
38:58 all right if you want to look at our
39:00 waist than just you know confiscate the
39:03 the pipe of a normal toilet and a house
39:05 and you can have all the DNA you need
39:07 right what's interesting is is that the
39:10 the UFO the saucer that was presented in
39:14 the first meeting of the disclosure
39:16 group by dr. Steven Greer is probably
39:19 one of the most classically recreated
39:21 flying saucers that has ever been
39:25 theorized out of probably the 50s even
39:28 the late 40s
39:29 it looks hokey as hell right it looks
39:32 just like out of some first-year prop
39:35 designer in the early 40s trying to
39:37 create some sort of flying saucer on
39:39 some MGM project
39:41 it's a saucer it has a ball on the top
39:44 you know any of you've seen the Day the
39:47 Earth Stood Still or which is 1951 in
39:50 1956 Forbidden Planet
39:53 those two flying saucers are badass
39:56 looking really cool but the hokey
40:00 artists that created this other one is
40:01 just I think a hokey artist but it keeps
40:04 getting carried and you know once
40:05 someone draws the the interior of what's
40:09 inside a UFO where do they sit you order
40:12 this [ __ ] where do they go to sleep all
40:14 those things are missing besides the
40:16 seating arrangement how does the
40:18 propulsion system work it's always loose
40:21 you know Lazar did a pretty good job his
40:25 UFO looks totally different than Stephen
40:27 Greer's UFO it's still a saucer there's
40:31 something we're missing here it just
40:32 bothers me we all want to believe don't
40:35 we we all do believe that we're not the
40:37 only thing in the universe and you could
40:39 be a Christian and still believe that if
40:41 we were the only things in the universe
40:43 then God has about seven and a half
40:45 billion friends right - the souls that
40:49 are out there supposedly right mm-hmm
40:52 there's a lot of religious art and
40:56 ancient art and I would say I shouldn't
41:00 probably lean too hard on ancient art
41:02 but there are hieroglyphs that are
41:03 fairly interesting you need to study
41:06 hieroglyphs before you think that
41:07 there's Apache Apache helicopters and
41:09 hieroglyphs
41:11 but there's weird things that are
41:13 painted in the skies aren't there I mean
41:14 like weird chrome saucer looking things
41:17 and fleets like armadas over the earth
41:20 without any real tail of these things
41:24 being up there but then we coin a little
41:29 phrase here which I'm going to say is
41:30 and you can use this for a lot of
41:31 different things in history I'm gonna
41:35 call it a retraction history and what
41:38 that means is it was printed on the
41:40 front page relatively speaking everyone
41:43 read it and then it was deemed false and
41:47 at week two weeks month a year later
41:50 it's retracted entirely on page seven we
41:54 know about a lot of things that are like
41:56 that right a lot of false flags or
41:59 retraction history
42:02 you know the ar-15 is always reported at
42:05 every single mass murder in the whole
42:08 planet and then when you finally study
42:11 the news of it it wasn't there at all
42:12 but they don't want pays attention to
42:16 the retraction that you go around spew
42:18 this what the amount of times ar-15s
42:20 been at all these other places it's like
42:22 nope you're wrong with computer imagery
42:26 today the problem is is that you can
42:29 never trust anything you see on the
42:31 Internet you can't if your friend hands
42:35 you their telephone and they're just a
42:38 normal human being without access to
42:39 these individuals then you could
42:40 probably trust that video if you see it
42:43 with your own two eyes you can trust
42:46 that it doesn't mean you're seeing what
42:48 you think you're seeing but at least you
42:49 can trust that you can't identify it
42:51 it's flying in ways the aircraft don't
42:54 fly normally and there you go but what
42:57 happens if you have a video that can
43:01 pass is legit in today's market just ask
43:05 anyone who has a adsense account
43:07 attached to their YouTube account you
43:11 know if I could take my buddies who do
43:13 all the Star Trek shows on TV and you
43:15 know all the sci-fi stuff out there and
43:17 say you know there's the thing I'm gonna
43:18 bring you a plate that I'm gonna shoot
43:20 in Orange County and I say well what's
43:24 the best time of day for you guys to
43:25 insert elements of UFOs and let me know
43:31 oh well it's probably better on an
43:33 overcast day because lighting would be
43:34 more ambient or whatever magic hours
43:36 good or doesn't even matter
43:37 just film anything and we'll figure out
43:39 how to insert stuff I'm like he don't
43:40 put anything super fancy in there you
43:42 know less descriptive the better but you
43:44 know it's gotta go with the Chrome II
43:45 kind of thing we're not gonna go with
43:48 any like retro rockets here and there
43:50 because that's more man technology let's
43:53 go with something more warping space in
43:55 time hey maybe we'll take lazarre's
43:58 claims of these antimatter engines and
44:00 then because it you know warp space and
44:03 time it moves the ether wind away from
44:05 the edge that's going to fall into
44:07 creating a negative gravity pocket
44:10 that's let's make you know one inside
44:14 kind of wobble the pixels behind it
44:16 and they could do it in two seconds man
44:18 I mean it relatively speaking they can
44:19 do it very very quickly and very
44:20 inexpensively the only debate would be
44:23 who's gonna pay for the render time
44:25 that's it and as long as you don't
44:26 render that much it's not that not that
44:28 expensive it's really just that easy
44:31 these kids are doing it in their
44:32 basements at colleges using render farms
44:35 at the schools and hey they just send
44:37 the batch up you know what it is is
44:39 theirs
44:40 let's say you need five thousand frames
44:42 of animation to cover a minute and a
44:44 half or something like that they just
44:48 send it up to the college farm it gets
44:50 rendered no professor's looking at it
44:51 nobody knows it was even used to to
44:54 create a fraudulent piece of art but the
44:57 kid gets a decent job in Hollywood
44:58 doesn't he I think an alien race that
45:02 could get here interdimensionally or
45:05 hyper spacing across the cosmo cosmos
45:09 they would have some logic to it and
45:12 I'll tell you why everything in life is
45:16 a business venture you time is money
45:19 time is your time on this planet right
45:22 unless you can defeat the Grim Reaper
45:24 you're going to die at some point you
45:28 know keep your beliefs about an
45:31 afterlife and all that alive I'm not
45:32 contesting that whatsoever but you're
45:35 only going to be this person one time
45:36 even if there's a reincarnation only
45:39 going to be you once and so everything
45:40 you do matters if there's any type of
45:45 risk to your life what you're doing
45:48 could hurt you
45:49 you could be captured you could die you
45:52 could starve to death any of the
45:55 anything like that that's when you start
45:58 to pay attention more to what you're
45:59 doing you start to evaluate it you guys
46:02 have done this your entire life someone
46:05 says a jump off that cliff down to the
46:07 water and you look down you go I've
46:08 never jumped off a cliff before that's
46:11 50 feet
46:13 we don't have an ambulance anywhere
46:16 nearby and you guys don't know what the
46:17 [ __ ] you're doing cuz you're drunk
46:18 I think I'll pass and you manage your
46:21 life like that
46:24 with everything I've ever heard about
46:26 UFOs
46:27 I shouldn't say everything I've ever
46:31 heard but a lot of the claims that are
46:33 very specific by man it seems to negate
46:37 this logic again there's no plan right
46:40 it doesn't seem to be any phase plan
46:42 from them to us and I think that that
46:45 would just be something that would exist
46:48 if they're gonna invest all this time
46:50 and incur all this risk especially after
46:54 1947 crash it was Raimi's right the guy
46:58 that went to his deathbed saying that
47:03 that happened and he spoke to an alien
47:05 the one that survived the crash of 47
47:08 they said before he was actually picked
47:10 up and taken away alien that he had this
47:13 sort of telepathic communication with
47:15 his alien and he he almost wept this guy
47:18 when he went back to the side of the
47:20 crash and was recalling this he said you
47:23 know the little guys said don't worry no
47:27 one's coming to get me and I have
47:29 accepted the fact that I'm here that
47:34 sounds like a huge risk that guy took if
47:36 that little aliens real and think about
47:39 that go to another planet you crash
47:43 you're small they're huge and you're now
47:46 gonna be captured by their military
47:48 right I don't know do you get treated
47:51 well did your cut apart x-rayed what
47:54 happens you don't know but safe to say
47:57 unless you're this massive intellectual
48:01 juggernaut you're gonna be freaked out
48:05 that happens in 1947 let's just say so
48:10 what would all the other visitors think
48:12 about visiting earth according to these
48:16 paintings from back in the Middle Ages
48:18 and all of the desert drawings and maybe
48:24 some hieroglyphs they've been doing this
48:26 for
48:27 long time for some of you might be
48:31 thinking well all they're doing is
48:33 working with our DNA okay they have been
48:39 visiting us if you believe in Anunnaki
48:41 or you like lumeria or Atlantis or you
48:45 believe a lot of the tales out of Africa
48:47 or South America they've been at this
48:50 for thousands and thousands of years but
48:53 supposedly they're Jalopy still hasn't
48:56 figured out the anomalies of our
48:58 atmosphere you know there's a bunch of
49:00 theories of how the Roswell crash would
49:02 have happened first theories I ever
49:04 heard were lightning bolts hitting it
49:07 again no one was there in terms of when
49:10 it had the anomaly the only thing anyone
49:12 ever said they saw was this craft
49:13 falling out of the sky then there was
49:15 the theory of radar and then when we
49:17 finally realized that radar was pretty
49:19 kooky that was dropped for about two
49:21 decades and then Steven Greer
49:23 resurrected that theory at an interview
49:24 and so no it's a very special radar that
49:26 we had oh very special radar we don't
49:30 have in 2018 that has been Declassified
49:33 it's still hokey he's still trying to
49:36 reinvent the myth in my opinion Bob
49:39 Lazar said that when he went to s4 he
49:42 saw I think he said nine and he said all
49:45 the other ones had big dents in them and
49:48 big you know parts of the ship that was
49:50 destroyed but his ship was pristine
49:53 indicating okay we shot one with the
49:56 Sidewinder missile they can catch a
49:59 vehicle that can go under 0 to 30
50:01 thousand miles an hour or 0 to 4,000
50:03 miles an hour at the speed of a bullet
50:05 faster than a bullet somehow we cut him
50:08 off guard by innovating them with a
50:10 hundred missiles at once all heat
50:12 sinking whatever gravity sinking
50:14 antimatter sinking missiles logic logic
50:19 doesn't that just [ __ ] hurt your
50:21 brain that someone would say that it's
50:22 just that easy one of the most
50:25 convincing interviews from project
50:26 disclosure is this soldier that said
50:28 that one of the ships crashed into a
50:30 mountainside he was very convincing
50:33 he was just on site he saw it he said he
50:36 could feel the aliens inside it was
50:39 dripping this crazy chemical
50:41 and then these other people showed up
50:44 out of nowhere and these vehicles that
50:46 were seemingly man-made but way advanced
50:49 way more advanced than anything you'd
50:50 ever seen they roughed him up for you
50:54 know 14 hours straight and then he was
50:57 in their captivity for 36 hours
50:58 threatened threatened threatened and
51:00 released they have to know the guy is
51:02 gonna talk at some point it's just human
51:04 nature right
51:05 scorpion strikes the Fox it's just what
51:08 he does right
51:09 it seems man-made doesn't it how many
51:14 movies have you seen where in fact Mars
51:16 attack does it a lot Twilight zones do
51:19 it Independence Day did it where the
51:23 military takes over the operation it's
51:24 all a big hostile exchange because you
51:27 know back in the 50s aliens were pretty
51:29 cool if they didn't live in swamps or
51:32 something like that right we went the
51:33 more arthur c clarke monolith styled
51:36 alien which is that they are here to
51:38 enlighten us to get us to the next stage
51:41 everyone needs to push every once in a
51:43 while right we do it to each other
51:45 why wouldn't aliens do it to us but
51:47 according to arthur c clarke it's a
51:48 beautiful natural plan this monolith
51:51 came down and visit us and primal man
51:53 taught us about weaponry taught us about
51:55 eating meat to expand our visual cortex
51:58 and our brain size and our logic and
52:01 then it put up monolith on the moon and
52:04 said well once you figure out a way to
52:05 get to the moon you'll be ready for the
52:07 next lesson brilliant after we found
52:10 that monolith it disappears and a big
52:13 giant monolith ends up out there
52:14 orbiting Jupiter so you have to get an
52:17 interplanetary now long distances one
52:23 after the other after the other arthur
52:26 c-- clark thought well about these
52:28 aliens he's criticized as a matter of
52:31 fact in the literary world because his
52:33 theme was so alien smart human stupid
52:37 now 3001 Space Odyssey for me blew the
52:40 whole franchise but he was very old when
52:43 he wrote that we were watching some
52:46 videos at my lounge yesterday and it was
52:48 showing those I forgot what the clouds
52:50 are called but it's sort of like the
52:52 mothership cloud you know
52:53 big round beautiful thing in the sky
52:57 lots of lights flashing inside this
53:02 particular video was absolutely gorgeous
53:05 and it showed like blue light constantly
53:08 flashing on the inside and it was it was
53:10 constant it never turned off so it was
53:11 not like lightning that strikes even if
53:16 it's very frequent it would be kind of a
53:18 strobe this thing just had a big blue
53:20 light inside of it it was massive I mean
53:23 it must have been I don't know three
53:25 miles four miles across sort of thing
53:29 and there's theories about aliens using
53:32 clouds as a mechanism to study us they
53:35 form out of nowhere I think it's just an
53:37 anomaly of clouds to this point bill
53:40 Cooper who said he saw the spacecraft
53:43 fly into the ocean then the ocean theory
53:46 started to kind of make it into science
53:47 fiction
53:48 we had the movie abyss by James Cameron
53:50 with Ed Harris they're down there and we
53:55 just needed to shake hands with them and
53:56 let them know we're good and they're
53:58 willing to surface one of their mother
53:59 ships at the end of the film right not
54:03 that anyone else saw it I don't believe
54:06 in any theory that is Earth has a bunch
54:08 of resources that everyone else needs we
54:12 on earth have theorized hundreds of
54:15 techniques to terraform any planet that
54:17 has a solid surface we have all kinds of
54:20 theories by terraform Mars yes we're
54:23 hindered because we can't just lump
54:25 everything over there we don't have at
54:27 least revealed to the mankind at this
54:29 point fusion but let me get you a sort
54:34 of drop in the bucket for what we could
54:36 do if we could master the materials that
54:38 make up the universe and say II throw
54:40 winds let's say we can control II throw
54:42 winds and push them into currents that
54:43 we could make any atom that we want
54:46 isn't it the Dyson Sphere not to be
54:51 confused with the excellent Dyson vacuum
54:55 cleaners you can buy for your house
54:57 leave is called the Dyson Sphere they've
54:59 they've ran it a couple times on Star
55:00 Trek where you can build a if you could
55:02 build a sphere around your solar system
55:05 then you would have the ability to
55:07 harvest infinite energy from the Sun all
55:11 right how would you build such a thing I
55:13 always think about this
55:14 we can't just cannibalize planetary
55:18 planetary materials because it wouldn't
55:20 be enough to make a Dyson Sphere you
55:24 would have to harness the energy out of
55:26 the universe the materials the subatomic
55:28 fabric of the universe and convince it
55:30 to be steel aluminium titanium onate
55:33 neom whatever it is you can make it
55:35 happen
55:37 perhaps that's beyond our alien friends
55:40 but the second you can give fusion out
55:43 of nowhere and a zero-point energy
55:45 system is that is the day that you can
55:47 start experimenting with the next phase
55:49 which is fusion material creation the
55:54 second you can create anything with a
55:55 little tiny gadget is the second you can
55:58 build anything that you can imagine you
56:01 have to build it correctly but all these
56:03 big ships that we see on Star Wars
56:05 movies the Star Destroyers the Death
56:08 Star all these gigantic vehicles that
56:10 consume a tremendous amount of materials
56:13 well you would be able to build those
56:16 things out of little nano systems little
56:20 robots that go around just saying I need
56:22 a little piece of this boop or like a 3d
56:26 printer they could just print the whole
56:27 ship from front to back in the middle of
56:29 space harvesting the ether wins to
56:32 created and I dearly assumed that if we
56:35 could harness ether winds into mass that
56:38 we could build gigantic things ships
56:43 bigger than the whole solar system if I
56:44 really wanted to the other fascinating
56:47 thing about UFOs and some of you are
56:50 gonna have reference to exceptions to
56:53 this and I acknowledge that but most of
56:55 them are really small pretty small
56:58 little disks now again we've had all
57:01 these all these sightings that say that
57:04 you know a big object was in the sky
57:06 that's like you know 100 miles long and
57:09 it's blocking all the stars and it comes
57:11 at night and those little lights on it
57:13 there's a couple scenes in Close
57:16 Encounters of the Third Kind when the
57:18 mother
57:18 ship must have been moving in to Devil's
57:20 Tower and that was pretty cool it was
57:24 very well conceptualized in that film
57:27 but we haven't had the was that the
57:31 district 9 thing happened we haven't had
57:33 the independence thing happened we're a
57:35 big giant spaceship just shows up out of
57:38 nowhere and hovers over New York City or
57:39 Paris that would seem like they had a
57:42 plan wouldn't it but how would we run a
57:46 plan of such a such a monumental moment
57:52 in the history of the inhabitants of
57:53 this planet well the first thing is is
57:56 we'd have to make sure that they knew
57:58 that we were here if we are the aliens
58:01 we'd have to make sure that they knew
58:03 that we were friendly how do you do that
58:07 there's the sci-fi movie that came out
58:09 recently which name escapes me but they
58:12 they essentially had these giant
58:14 elongated eggs that showed up to earth
58:16 and they just hovered over various
58:21 places in the world they didn't do
58:23 anything and we figured out a way to get
58:26 inside and we started talking to these
58:28 sort of squid type creatures that had to
58:30 be in their own in you know
58:31 environmental environment and they
58:33 started talking in these paintings this
58:34 beautiful kind of Dvorak sort of things
58:37 right and then we started decoding them
58:39 it was a very beautiful concept the
58:41 movie got a lot of popularity a lot of
58:43 good ratings I don't see its strong like
58:47 eight I think but I think that that's a
58:51 beautiful way of saying we would need to
58:52 bring a craft to a planet that looks um
58:59 formidable right non-threatening it
59:02 doesn't have a bunch of guns on it right
59:05 it's big which gives them the presence
59:07 attack that we are sophisticated and we
59:10 are control we are in control of mass
59:15 energy I mean if we hover to gigantic
59:19 spacecraft over maybe a more desolate
59:22 area not a super populated area that way
59:24 you don't freak out la you don't freak
59:26 out New York you just over Kansas and
59:29 you got a ship that's a hundred miles
59:30 long
59:31 hell it doesn't have to have anyone in
59:33 it to be honest you don't have to even
59:34 be on it the thing is there and we let
59:38 it hover just one we just bring in one
59:40 so it's not too crazy you know whoever
59:44 whoever gets it in their backyard wins
59:47 well maybe we just put it in the
59:49 desolate desert or no one lives Mojave
59:52 Desert or something
59:55 hopefully we have done our due diligence
59:56 and figured out how to communicate with
59:58 these individuals we figure out a peace
60:00 sign something very simple something
60:03 very symbolic we have no business
60:06 touching base with a world if we don't
60:08 have that minimum amount of
60:09 communication wouldn't you say
60:10 we'd have to drop some sort of
60:12 communication whether we're here to stay
60:15 or not
60:17 but I would suggest as a little planner
60:20 myself we would leave after leaving our
60:23 message of peace perhaps indicating when
60:25 we're going to return try to calculate
60:30 some sort of psychological adaption
60:32 maybe even make it a variable adaption
60:34 saying we're going to doubt we're going
60:36 to now watch their communications to see
60:38 how they ingested that first visit but
60:40 they know we exist now and they know we
60:42 mean peace perhaps we just leave
60:46 something beautiful behind we just leave
60:48 a sculpture that's just gorgeous it's
60:52 benign it doesn't hurt anything doesn't
60:54 have any weird materials that will hurt
60:56 a human being when we touch it doesn't
60:58 leak into the atmosphere something made
61:00 out of made it maybe even made out of
61:01 the stone that is indigenous to that
61:03 world but it's beautiful and it's
61:05 sophisticated well you way beyond Machu
61:07 Picchu walls or Stonehenge or the
61:09 pyramids something beautiful but we
61:13 watch and we listen maybe on our
61:16 sculpture we we give them an impression
61:18 of what we look like we watch their
61:21 military react
61:23 perhaps we give them a gift gift in the
61:28 form of I don't know health we take an
61:32 area that is struggling to grow food and
61:34 we grow it better than they've ever seen
61:36 it we leave behind some experiments that
61:39 they can run for themselves if we can
61:42 write in their language
61:43 that would really help wouldn't it leave
61:45 behind a rosetta stone telling them how
61:47 we perceive them and how they hopefully
61:50 they perceive us what we mean but we
61:53 have to do it in a way that the military
61:56 industrial complex can't usurp the
61:58 moment and brand us in a particular way
62:01 we have to be clear and concise tell
62:07 them what we're not doing tell them what
62:08 we want to do and then we have to return
62:11 don't we probably as quick as we
62:15 possibly can because if we wait too long
62:17 that first visit will fall into myth not
62:22 today with our video cameras and
62:23 what-have-you
62:24 it would simply maybe be deemed as a
62:28 video stunt especially if we put in a
62:30 very remote location which people can't
62:32 visit all we would have to do is rely on
62:34 fake news to get our in gestation of
62:37 this stuff right these are all the
62:41 factors we have to think about when we
62:42 pick a place to show up and how we show
62:44 up we have to be gentle but eventually
62:48 we got to come back eventually we have
62:51 to find some members of our race that
62:53 are willing to step out of the vehicle
62:56 hopefully they've acclimated to what we
62:58 look like hopefully we don't pick a race
63:00 that looks so much different than us
63:02 that they're going to be alarmed at our
63:04 parents what if we look like the the
63:07 bugs was a star troopers or whatever it
63:12 was
63:12 the bugs came down yeah probably try to
63:15 find some bipedal humanoid beings a bit
63:18 like us but then we have to figure out
63:21 what we're trying to do on our end are
63:23 we trying to expand ourselves by talking
63:24 to a primitive culture are we just
63:26 trying to map the universe like Google
63:28 Maps wanna show up take a few 360 images
63:31 and get out of town mmm maybe we have to
63:34 figure out what our objectives are and
63:36 then probably clearly communicate them
63:38 to serve man right these are the basic
63:43 things that a human being said in his
63:44 backyard that average intelligence could
63:48 come up with in one hour and what I am
63:52 not seeing in every reported sighting
63:55 and every reported claim is an
63:57 thing remotely like this and I think
64:00 that defies logic
64:01 thus deeming everything that I've heard
64:04 extremely suspect what is the same the
64:09 saying is outrageous claims require
64:11 outrageous evidence right I haven't seen
64:16 any of you oh I've heard a lot of very
64:19 legitimate claims that I believe are
64:22 vehicles that that man has created right
64:26 and of course there's that romantic idea
64:28 that it's it's alien technology man that
64:31 handed it down to us pyramids were not
64:33 built by aliens okay anyway let me know
64:37 what you think in the in the comments I
64:39 know I'm sort of circling around this
64:41 the episodes are sort of similar in
64:43 theme but I think it just requires more
64:45 thoughts this could have been called
64:47 part 2 of previous episodes but I just
64:50 thought I want you to really focus on
64:51 the logic of how we would do this
64:54 because intelligence follows the rule as
64:57 it is above so - it is below right at no
65:00 point if there is a God can manage Eve
65:03 more compassion than God it's just not
65:08 possible if you're going to give god the
65:10 omnipotent nature of all knowledge I
65:14 know people that are so cool and so
65:17 intellectual and so enlightened and I
65:19 don't mean in any academic PhD way some
65:22 of them have PhDs but that's just
65:24 incidental to their nature they were
65:26 cool since they came out of their mom
65:28 and they take a lot to anger to offend
65:34 in fact I know probably at least one
65:36 human being I'm not sure that's ever
65:38 happened this guy has has taken it on
65:41 the chin several times with life and he
65:43 just sees it in a way of productivity
65:46 and the stages of life and he is
65:51 superior to any being I've seen in the
65:53 Bible when you read all the lines about
65:57 one person about one being maybe save
66:01 Christ himself of course even he got
66:05 pissed off he chased the money changers
66:07 out of the temple
66:09 got pissed off at Judas in a loving way
66:14 of course perhaps that's the nature of
66:16 man once you enter man's body I'm
66:19 holding out for aliens to have some
66:21 intellectual superiority but perhaps
66:23 that in itself is the fallacy of my own
66:25 thinking this is why it's important to
66:28 share so if you're on YouTube please
