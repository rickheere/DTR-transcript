00:28 welcome to deep thoughts ladies and
00:30 gentlemen on this brisk sort of fall
00:34 winter night in late October so I
00:38 recorded an episode the other day and it
00:42 it was kind of a a bizarre episode and I
00:47 got through editing it was about 3/4
00:52 through and I thought man this is just
00:54 screwed and by the time I cut out all of
00:58 the wind sound which you know I've
01:00 recorded several episodes with a little
01:01 bit of wind this was a day when it was
01:04 over 90 degrees here in SoCal and it was
01:08 just it was amazing I never can tell you
01:10 how much wind it is you know I can tell
01:13 you almost to the degree how hot it is
01:14 outside in Fahrenheit but I can never
01:17 tell you what the win is but it was bad
01:19 it's on video I edited all the way
01:22 together and I thought you know what I
01:23 did all this work it's not completely
01:26 horrible and I thought well you know
01:30 I've got patreon subscribers and I don't
01:32 really have anything special for you
01:34 guys just yet and so I went ahead and
01:38 published it on the patreon so you can
01:41 get a link to it if you want to go see
01:42 it it's called moon preparations and my
01:46 goal there was to really talk about all
01:48 the platform technology that really
01:50 never gets explained but we're supposed
01:53 to accept this stuff without any
01:56 explanation so and it's been three or
02:00 four days I put out two other episodes
02:02 and now I've got a name for this one I
02:07 believe what I'm gonna call it as moon
02:10 hoax unexplained science what that means
02:15 is we will have all of these
02:19 conversations especially when I'm at at
02:21 my smoke lounge in the rare case that we
02:25 get into like a moon soup-to-nuts
02:27 conversation because all the regulars
02:29 we've already had the conversation
02:30 20,000 times and so it's almost as if no
02:33 one's interested in it you know and so
02:36 but when a newcomer comes
02:38 and he or she's hot on it well it's a
02:40 blast to go through it now for someone
02:43 who believes the moon hoax they're
02:47 really the talker and what I mean by
02:50 that is someone who believes we went
02:53 they believe the hoax is true that's
02:57 kind of a weird way to say that for
02:59 those of us who think it was a hoax and
03:01 we don't believe it we don't try to go
03:05 for the specifics all the time because
03:08 the the entire story drops off really
03:12 really fast
03:14 meaning we look at the Van Allen belts
03:17 and we're like hey you know that doesn't
03:20 make any sense
03:21 but when you try to believe it that's
03:25 when things get a little funny because
03:27 we realize right off the bat they've
03:30 kind of got us by the balls with science
03:33 the aerospace industry as it is you
03:37 could potentially say astrophysics but
03:41 the problem is is that their technology
03:44 is obviously shrouded for maybe national
03:50 security reasons or some other [ __ ]
03:54 and again everyone's going to the moon
03:56 man
03:57 so what's secret anymore there's possums
04:01 over there but now NASA says they're
04:04 going back to the moon in 2024 one of
04:07 the listeners said they heard it it's
04:08 2028 now all right again I have no
04:14 problem with that as long as we really
04:15 go delay all you want I totally support
04:17 your delay be honest
04:20 we'll continue funding you and get there
04:23 but be transparent about what you've
04:25 figured out now what's interesting about
04:29 the whole thing
04:30 is that let's take a different example
04:34 when it comes to moon technology I know
04:38 I'm kind of jumping ahead here but it
04:41 all starts out with platform technology
04:43 you have a platform that allows you to
04:47 accomplish something you know if you
04:49 want to get from LA
04:52 to New York and you want to fly well
04:55 there's a platform called a jet and the
04:58 platform is built out of all kinds of
05:00 sub technologies we know even third
05:05 world countries understand the shape of
05:06 a wing how to create lift what a
05:09 third-world country doesn't have access
05:11 to necessarily is the original
05:14 engineering schematics and the patents
05:16 for rolls-royce engines Boeing engines
05:20 Lockheed Martin engines stealth engines
05:23 all this kind of stuff right so they
05:25 know if they can get amount of thrust on
05:28 the back of a plane to push it a certain
05:30 speed then the wing is gonna do its its
05:34 trick and of course when you change the
05:35 shape of the plane you put a bunch of
05:37 extra weight where it never was before
05:38 you want to move things around a little
05:40 bit while then you're getting into you
05:43 know aviation technology and engineering
05:46 and that's what the geniuses do what
05:48 they do so you could produce a plane and
05:51 fully explain it to the public and
05:54 simply keep things like the the engines
05:57 black boxes but you're still explaining
06:01 force lifts whatever with the moon
06:06 missions there's a very interesting
06:09 thing going on because it's a bunch of
06:12 catch-22 is it seems to me now I don't
06:16 think anyone would argue that the
06:19 average education of a human being in
06:21 1969 and all the preceding decades prior
06:24 may be starting around 1930 at least but
06:29 I've been think about it
06:30 maybe in terms of American schools we
06:33 still produced Edison if we still had
06:36 people like Tesla walking around we had
06:38 all these geniuses in the books you
06:40 could get a hold of wasn't quite as good
06:41 as Barnes and Noble or going on the
06:44 internet and buying a book where people
06:46 understood engineering now sadly because
06:50 some nerd understands html5 and css3
06:54 they look back on people in the sixties
06:57 and go out look how stupid they were I
06:59 think per capita of synapses consumed
07:03 for knowledge
07:05 way smarter in the 60s than now however
07:09 regardless of how smart someone is when
07:13 you invent a whole new platform of
07:14 technology which is space travel the
07:16 whole lot of it all right of course
07:19 there's platforms to put up satellites
07:21 there's platforms to put up saddle ins
07:25 which are balloon satellites there's
07:26 rocketry there's ballistic missile
07:29 rocketry which is never going to leave
07:31 the atmosphere and then there's slow
07:33 orbital Rockets that are supposedly you
07:36 know pushing astronauts in the orbit and
07:38 then of course the outrageous claim that
07:42 they went to the moon aback which is
07:44 hilarious right and again for the
07:48 newcomers let me just give you this
07:49 analogy for the old folks be patient
07:52 with me for 60 seconds if you were to
07:55 take the average 8 foot wall in a house
07:59 sorry it's standard but I'm actually
08:01 gonna give you a metric example I think
08:04 I don't know if England has eight foot
08:06 walls but we do I did some math once and
08:11 when you divide an 8 foot wall with
08:15 centimeters all the way down you get
08:18 about 200 and 37 centimeters
08:20 approximately from the bottom of the
08:22 floor to the top of the ceiling and if
08:25 we say each centimeter represents a
08:27 thousand miles then we've kind of got
08:30 this little example this visual example
08:32 of the floor is Earth's surface and the
08:37 ceiling is stepping on the moon now of
08:40 course we're negating orbital this
08:42 Anette the nice thing about metric in
08:45 this particular example is what is
08:47 metric it's a base 10 system so a
08:50 millimeter will divide into a centimeter
08:53 ten times well the highest we had been
08:56 prior to suggesting that I believe in
09:00 Apollo 8 we went to the moon 8 and 10
09:04 went to the moon and circled around and
09:05 came back okay before we actually went
09:09 there and supposedly got off and landed
09:12 we were only 200 miles up in fact I it's
09:16 most of the Wikipedia and
09:18 trees for those missions which would be
09:21 nine seven and below
09:22 it's barely 200 miles up which is an
09:26 extraordinary thing if we truly did that
09:28 I think that's reasonable to believe but
09:32 that's only two millimeters off the
09:34 ground with our little system so when
09:38 you want to think about how outrageous
09:40 the claim is from NASA that they were
09:43 able to travel to the moon okay which is
09:46 outrageous to the power of outrageous
09:51 they were only two meter two millimeters
09:53 off the ground and now they're going
09:54 eight feet to the ground two hundred and
09:56 thirty seven centimeters up circling
10:00 this thing then landing on a moving
10:03 object let me just think about all the
10:06 issues it is it is the difference
10:10 between walking around in this backyard
10:14 and saying you've got it all you got the
10:16 drop on on travel and then saying okay
10:22 I'm gonna meet you in New York and then
10:25 traveling over what two or three
10:26 mountain ranges you know going through
10:29 all kinds of hostile desert sand and
10:32 snowy mountains and you know all the
10:35 predators and all this other stuff that
10:37 is almost the type of thing that they
10:40 claimed because we've got the fan Allen
10:43 belts which start around 1,000 miles up
10:44 there 25,000 miles thick as soon as
10:47 you're outside of the Van Allen belts
10:49 well which will kill you you're in the
10:52 not the vacuum of space but you're in
10:54 the super radioactive area of space that
10:58 has sun emissions going by if there's a
11:00 coronal mass ejection the second you
11:03 take off and it's coming at you it could
11:08 hit you and fry even more but then you
11:11 have to catch this thing going around
11:13 the earth then you have to you know
11:17 separate the service module from the
11:19 lunar module and do all this crazy stuff
11:21 and then land a manoeuvre that no one
11:23 could have tested until the day they did
11:25 it right
11:29 and to get out there's no problem maybe
11:31 there's just like problems all along the
11:33 way and you guys have who've listened to
11:35 all my episodes know this for a fact
11:37 but what do we what do we deal with but
11:42 what do we deal with even if you're a
11:44 believer well let's go at some of the
11:47 things that I have presented several
11:49 times and other folks have you know I
11:52 have a I just love the issue that once
11:57 you get on the moon okay yeah
11:59 that's writing them like 50 blank checks
12:00 to get there once we get to the moon you
12:06 have a temperature issue without talking
12:09 about the oxygen issue and again I I did
12:13 look up that data the average oxygen
12:16 tank for a diver in deep sea if you're
12:21 if you're a rookie you can get a tank
12:23 that lasts an hour if you're a super
12:25 skilled diver and you're not doing any
12:28 heavy maneuvering I mean you're trying
12:30 to pick up treasure on the ground you're
12:31 breathing hard you can get two hours out
12:34 of a tank and so you could wear two
12:36 tanks on your back maybe getting three
12:38 and a half four hours if you're a pro
12:40 two hours if you're a wookie these guys
12:44 are on the moon for like 17 hours it's
12:47 unbelievable but as soon as they get off
12:49 of course NASA's claims are that you're
12:51 again you have a 500 degree swing in
12:53 temperature 280 plus in the sunlight
12:57 which is just 40 degrees off from
12:59 lighting a match in Fahrenheit and two
13:02 hundred hundred two hundred eighty
13:03 degrees below zero and a shadow so
13:06 you're walking from light to shadow
13:07 light to shadow and you're getting
13:08 cooked and baked and frozen and all this
13:10 other stuff now if we present that to
13:13 NASA as believing children and go tell
13:16 us how you did that what kind of answer
13:18 do we get well children they had
13:22 spacesuits on really yeah and the
13:24 spacesuits protected them against hot
13:27 and cold okay you have any other
13:31 questions we have unexplained science
13:36 everywhere how do you have enough power
13:39 to keep the lunar module power
13:42 how'd you know how'd you have enough
13:44 oxygen in the back of that
13:46 stupid-looking backpack on the back of
13:49 the spacesuit to not only have power to
13:52 move the error to the tip of my toes to
13:55 the top of my head to the extremities of
13:57 my fingers but also have a tank of
14:00 oxygen somewhere
14:01 I can't scrub it out of anything right
14:04 if 1969 two folks but when you ask them
14:09 to fully explain what they claim is true
14:13 this is where everything falls apart
14:17 instantaneously it is the most
14:19 unequivocal Achilles heel of anyone
14:23 claiming that we went to the moon
14:25 because all of their answers are pseudo
14:29 answers pseudo knowledge it's sort of a
14:33 denial black box right what's the theory
14:36 of a black box hey it does what it does
14:39 and you don't have to know anything
14:41 about it okay and hey if it actually did
14:45 it you know we would see for most human
14:48 beings on planet Earth everything's a
14:50 black box you know because they don't
14:52 know anything about electronics and you
14:55 know you don't you shouldn't have to
14:56 know you look at your computer you're a
14:58 grandmother who's 80 years old and
15:01 you're looking at this computer you have
15:04 no clue depending on your background a
15:07 lot of ladies involved with the initial
15:09 computers of this world so I'm not
15:10 trying to slight and pick on a woman but
15:12 let's just say it's it's this wonderful
15:14 grandmother like mine I have no idea
15:16 what a hard drive is what memory is
15:18 she's what do you call this thing again
15:21 that's a mouse cream oh okay that's cute
15:24 when we went from CRT monitors the flat
15:27 screens four or five different species
15:30 of flat screens you think the average
15:32 consumer knows what's going on
15:35 heyno if a guy's a a you know
15:39 electronics guy sure he's gonna know the
15:41 difference between OLEDs and LEDs and
15:44 LCDs and this is where we could go at
15:51 this now that we know this right you
15:52 know this to be true
15:53 it's like a big aha moment oh my
15:55 yeah even when things are explained to
15:58 me when they're not truly explained to
16:00 me such that I can understand the true
16:03 signs of it all I just accept it and
16:07 part of that is just a necessity of
16:10 survival right you don't want to have to
16:13 have everything explained to you
16:17 however we are trying to uncover one of
16:20 the greatest mysteries
16:22 / lies to humanity / Hollywood hoaxes
16:26 perpetrated by the government on the
16:29 American people with billions and
16:32 billions of dollars laundered through
16:36 this space program and because they
16:40 won't come clean with what they were
16:41 actually doing which is probably just
16:43 missile systems for the military because
16:45 they weren't going to be able to get
16:47 Americans to support such a thing
16:49 directly which is a little weird if they
16:53 actually did make that decision because
16:54 we did just have the Cuban Missile
16:56 Crisis and all they needed to say was we
17:00 are in a Cold War nuclear threat is real
17:03 and even if you wanted to deliver
17:06 conventional warheads that weren't
17:08 nuclear you got to get them there and
17:10 we're gonna have to develop this
17:11 technology and it's gonna cost fifty
17:14 billion dollars in 1970s money I think
17:19 most people would probably go for it
17:21 maybe not a overwhelming majority but
17:24 enough to get it passed
17:25 not that we get a chance to vote on [ __ ]
17:27 in this world so what's the best way to
17:30 apply this theory I think I have an
17:34 answer
17:35 platform technologies if we were to
17:40 break down the moon mission especially
17:43 in 1969 to 72 but also for this new
17:49 claim that they're gonna go to the moon
17:50 and do you know a whole new mission and
17:53 you know again if you read the website
17:55 it is like reading Walt Disney's wet
17:59 dream from 1955 when he was trying to
18:02 create Tomorrowland and give everyone
18:04 that mission to Mars and all that stuff
18:05 if it came from Walt Disney
18:08 you would be excited that he has thought
18:10 through this whole thing and he's
18:12 building an amusement park it is gonna
18:14 simulate what NASA claims are gonna do
18:16 in 2024 slash potentially 28 slash some
18:20 other day again as long as they were
18:23 honest man I would so get behind some
18:28 form of a NASA I think space force
18:31 should take on everything military and
18:34 if SpaceX launches something for space
18:37 force that should be transparent to the
18:40 public
18:40 again we don't potentially need to know
18:43 how everything works but if they say I
18:46 put us a pious satellite up there at
18:47 least to say that in the eighties with
18:49 the Space Shuttle as a spy satellite yes
18:51 but you can't say it's as those things
18:54 but if we were to take the moon missions
18:57 again Apollo 11 let's just say that what
19:00 are the platforms well they're all over
19:05 the place
19:05 to be honest but at its most crude form
19:09 you have sort of a Russian doll
19:11 situation you have as an external most
19:16 prominent platform the Saturn 5 within
19:22 the Saturn 5 and its first little shell
19:24 you're gonna have a service module which
19:28 just has a little triangle capsule in it
19:30 which is where our astronauts are gonna
19:33 ride out this launch but inside there
19:36 there's actually a a lunar module as
19:41 well the thing with the four legs it's
19:44 gonna actually land on the moon surface
19:46 so you kind of have two sub platforms
19:49 inside service module lunar module once
19:52 they get in orbit around the moon using
19:57 the service module and it's a little
19:59 thruster engine it's gonna the asteroids
20:02 are gonna go through the nose cone go
20:04 into the lunar module and then they're
20:06 gonna step off and when a tumor - we're
20:11 gonna go down one was gonna stay back
20:12 like into this crazy maneuver down to
20:15 the moon which has never been done
20:16 before it was done absolutely perfectly
20:19 but so you now have two platforms going
20:21 at the same
20:22 time now Michael Collins is in the
20:24 service module without the necessity of
20:27 wearing his space suit because he's got
20:30 full-blown oxygen forever and ever plus
20:33 power I mean it's the most amazing
20:35 platform ever made with 1969 technology
20:39 again if Tesla could get ahold of the
20:41 battery technology in Apollo 11 we'd
20:44 have a million year battery today
20:46 because we are we are so much more
20:50 advanced than 1969 it's ridiculous you
20:56 had and I just gave you three milestones
20:59 right first milestone is the rope memory
21:03 computer that was inside supposedly and
21:07 they even have examples of it online I
21:09 never heard of this crap but I'm sure
21:10 people did there's videos of them making
21:12 the thing it's the most extraordinary
21:14 crazy invention I've ever seen I mean
21:16 hats off to them for this thing ever
21:18 working so that's the first milestone
21:21 then you have by 1980 you've got
21:24 something called the Cray computer now
21:27 the Cray computer is several million
21:29 times faster than the 1969 processor
21:33 okay well because I'm involved with film
21:37 and I know folks and special effects I
21:40 get to see presentations all the time
21:41 but my buddies who worked on these
21:43 legendary films and they did a little
21:46 thing back during the iPhone 4 and they
21:50 said they did two things how long would
21:52 it take to render the entire movie Tron
21:54 1982 that took like four or five
21:57 different computers to do it but they
22:00 compared its processing power to the
22:02 Cray computer of 1982 and it's a 282
22:05 same model I believe the estimate which
22:10 has changed a little bit but there's
22:12 like four million times faster than the
22:14 Cray they could render the entire movie
22:17 on an iPhone I believe in 26 minutes or
22:20 something like that maybe less I'm not
22:23 sure okay where are we in 2019 were
22:29 several orders of magnitude over an
22:31 iPhone 4 and if you really talk about
22:33 government computers that would be put
22:34 in some
22:36 ultimate apex of of processing
22:39 technology I am sure that we are 10 to
22:43 50 million times faster than an iPhone
22:45 when you talk about covert systems that
22:48 would go inside a space vehicle where we
22:51 want the best of the best right what's
22:53 the other platform well it's the space
22:56 suit the space suit itself is a platform
22:59 how do you keep astronauts alive
23:00 on surface of the Moon space suit now at
23:06 that point you're pretty good you just
23:08 play it all in Reverse when you want to
23:10 get back to earth except you have
23:13 another platform which is the mechanism
23:16 by which these astronauts are going to
23:18 re-enter the atmosphere kick out three
23:20 big giant parachutes the size of your
23:22 house which have those little tiny
23:25 parachutes pulling them open which if
23:29 you again research the parachutes it
23:30 seems impossible that that would ever be
23:33 possible because they were compressed to
23:35 the density of bark and you think these
23:38 little guys these little parachutes are
23:39 gonna pull them up go ahead let's take a
23:43 nice scientist who says that could be
23:45 done let's take his backpack parachute
23:48 and let's compress it down to the size
23:50 of like a kitchen sponge and we'll give
23:53 you a little little white parachute and
23:56 you just I'll just push you out of that
23:58 plane I'm gonna have a normal parachute
24:01 on I'm just gonna push you out of the
24:02 plane and we're gonna watch this little
24:05 tiny perish you pull this bark density
24:08 parachute out before you hit the ground
24:12 anything gonna happen again
24:15 that's another touch point in the
24:17 Achilles heel this whole thing they tell
24:21 us things we believe them and they get
24:24 away scot-free you ever see those little
24:27 movies where it's either the 1800s or
24:33 before our 1900s and before and there's
24:37 no technology there's no let's say you
24:40 go to 1800s there before and then you're
24:42 talking about there's no well let's just
24:45 say the telegram hasn't been invented
24:47 yet and so as long as you can get on a
24:48 horse
24:49 ride from town to town you could claim
24:51 that you're a different person at every
24:53 single town and no one would know the
24:55 better they have to believe you there's
25:00 no national ID there's nothing man you
25:05 gotta have some money on you to pay for
25:06 your your thing or you're gonna have to
25:08 work immediately when you get there earn
25:10 some money from the locals and then
25:12 start spending it in the community well
25:15 that's sort of what NASA's been able to
25:17 do you don't know you have to take my
25:22 paraphrased easy-to-understand
25:24 explanations which again it makes sense
25:27 depending on what audience we're talking
25:28 to here we're talking to little kids of
25:31 course but we should encourage the
25:34 children in my opinion to ask those
25:36 detailed questions well okay you know
25:39 it's like the little kid that goes goes
25:40 why why we need to be the little kids
25:43 that keep going how how you know explain
25:47 it to me now you might have an equation
25:49 in front of you that's a big calculus
25:51 equation and it's using all the Greek
25:55 symbols and what-have-you and so it's
25:57 off you skated from someone without a
25:59 mathematics degree or at least some sort
26:01 of mmm some early adoption of
26:05 mathematics okay but if we were to tell
26:08 them look your job is to prove to me
26:11 that that me a citizen of the country
26:14 that's going to give you tax money but I
26:17 could be spending on cigars if you want
26:20 to convince me to give up my cigars so
26:23 that you can have your space program as
26:25 your job here's what I want you to do
26:28 no more Greek algorithms
26:31 you know equations excuse me I want you
26:34 to break it down into computer code okay
26:37 put it in JavaScript something everyone
26:40 understands may be swift right but put
26:44 it in something that we can immediately
26:45 test it and for those of you aren't
26:47 programmers there are tons of websites
26:48 out there with JavaScript sandboxes
26:51 there's there's all kinds of different
26:53 languages but there's a website you just
26:55 bring it up and it's got panes cut into
26:58 your web browser and you can type an
27:00 algorithm on one side
27:02 fill up the values you know X equals 2 y
27:06 equals 1 and you could say you know
27:09 output X plus 1 and you say run you have
27:14 the little Run button and on the other
27:15 window it says 3 POW we got it if you
27:20 need to loop to create an algorithm of
27:21 some sort we're gonna create like a wave
27:23 of numbers they got that - it's all
27:26 there and you can if you're really good
27:28 you can download Mathematica and watch
27:30 this stuff roar so take each one of
27:33 those platforms and start dissecting
27:35 them because each platform has its sub
27:38 components like I said if a plane was
27:42 considered a platform to fly población
27:45 jealous to new york well without even
27:47 being a genius you know there's the wing
27:49 there's the wing design there's all
27:51 those little fins and stuff out there to
27:53 make sure it goes up and down the right
27:55 way then you have your engine and your
27:57 engine has all kinds of throttles on it
27:59 and techniques you have those little
28:01 fins that can be on the the backside of
28:04 the the engine you could have a two
28:07 engine configuration for engine
28:08 configuration single engine
28:10 configuration based on how many people
28:13 you've got in this plane that's a
28:14 different weight well what are all the
28:17 variables if you jumped inside the
28:19 turbine engine well okay how does
28:22 kerosene get on these fins and turn into
28:27 thrust you know there was that funny
28:30 conspiracy that jet engines work just on
28:33 air you know the real truth of the
28:35 matter is the turbines are one of the
28:37 most efficient engines ever invented
28:40 especially when you start ramming air
28:42 through them I believe the ratio is 20
28:45 percent of the engine energy and thrust
28:47 is generated by igniting flut fuel on
28:49 the outer fins our excuse me on the
28:52 inner fins and then the you know I guess
28:56 is the outer and then the the air
28:59 jamming through it actually provides 80
29:02 percent of the thrust
29:03 it's a beautiful configuration it's one
29:05 of the most fuel efficient ways to
29:07 travel it's a lot different on the
29:10 surface of the earth so when you create
29:11 these gen engine funny cars or those jet
29:14 engine you know salt flat
29:16 speed cars I'm not sure how much of that
29:20 ratio maintains itself but Saturn 5 has
29:26 a particular fuel mix there's all kinds
29:28 of genius behind the fuel mixes and
29:30 that's legit you know the first rocket
29:34 tears they had to figure out as you know
29:36 how do you store a liquid fuel inside of
29:39 a vertical container because it splashes
29:41 around and so as the buoyancy are
29:45 started the center of gravity starts to
29:48 change because you're actually consuming
29:49 the fuel and the tank is becoming empty
29:52 for any of you who have used to drive
29:55 you know hot rods and you hit it really
29:59 hard and you got one wheel on the right
30:00 that's attraction based axle and the
30:05 other ones gonna follow the the one on
30:07 the right and you throw your rear end
30:08 around and you like how the hell did
30:10 that happen I accelerated and my rear
30:13 end came around on a microscopic level
30:18 when you have a bunch of boosters but
30:20 underneath a rocket or even a single one
30:23 it's probably even worse with a single
30:24 one
30:25 maybe not it's still bad they had to
30:29 create all kinds of technology you know
30:31 those little nozzles now they kind of
30:33 swivel a little bit to make sure that it
30:35 stays upright and it's all real time
30:37 oops I'm tipping real microscopic little
30:40 thing happens and then poof it's back on
30:42 track it's phenomenal and it's mega
30:45 difficult obviously the education system
30:49 in this world is atrocious and America
30:51 is probably currently close to whatever
30:55 bottom of the first world country lists
30:57 that there is and yet we still generate
31:00 geniuses it's weird
31:02 so it's as if the knowledge is always
31:04 present for American children but you
31:07 have to have I guess a decent gene pool
31:11 you have to be you know luck of the draw
31:13 that you've got a dense a neural net to
31:15 be able to go this isn't enough I want
31:18 more and then boom they could become
31:20 hackers it's all over the place Chinese
31:22 Russians Indians all the Europeans good
31:26 you know I always think Australia too so
31:28 don't worry
31:29 so geniuses everywhere other areas not
31:33 so much so what platform technologies do
31:36 we really want to know about because we
31:38 could nitpick things to death and I
31:40 think we should I mean that the most
31:42 ideal methodology was that again if we
31:44 had our deep thoughts University and we
31:47 had several thousand members here's the
31:51 cool thing about this exercise you
31:53 wouldn't have to be massively technical
31:58 to get involved with this program this
32:02 exercise this test for agencies that
32:07 claim outrageous accomplishments and why
32:10 is that
32:10 because the very goal of this inquiry is
32:16 to say okay dudes you say you can put
32:19 this saturn v 200 miles above the
32:24 surface of the earth locked into orbit
32:27 around a ball that is several it's why
32:30 calculation i think it was 2.6 billion
32:32 times bigger than the object that's
32:34 that's left over in the end so you know
32:37 the center fine goes up and all these
32:40 stages come off when they fall back to
32:41 earth i think we can trust the footage
32:44 we've seen where the rings are coming
32:46 off and the camera shooting out the
32:47 bottom yeah i don't have any problem
32:50 believing that that big giant
32:52 monstrosity could accomplish that i
32:55 think some of you probably even question
32:57 that and hey you would be on the mission
32:59 to go to nasa and perhaps your slice of
33:04 the inquiry is to say okay you have f1
33:08 boosters of which you've never published
33:10 the specs on even though wikipedia has a
33:12 bunch of raqqa dying engine thrust
33:14 tables but we need to know how much does
33:19 this thing weigh which is all
33:20 above-ground technology I mean
33:21 above-ground facts that you can find out
33:23 so you take it all you write down as
33:24 much as you possibly can you like look
33:26 how is this thing work how do you fight
33:31 the atmosphere how do you get this thing
33:36 to turn perfectly I mean we see it do it
33:39 a little bit a multistage rockets
33:43 assistant way before 1969 I mean I used
33:46 to be you know again one of those
33:47 amateur rocket builders where you know
33:51 you build a little rocket and you get
33:52 the ABCD engines no problem I've seen
33:56 that stuff work on lesser situations you
33:59 can go out throw those festivals and
34:01 watch it happen all the time so we have
34:03 to totally believe that that's capable
34:05 just because it gets bigger it does get
34:07 harder but it's not unbelievable but I'd
34:10 like to know a lot more about how to
34:12 lock something in orbit they've
34:15 obviously you know they had to have
34:18 thrown something up there and it didn't
34:19 work right and then keep throwing a
34:21 little higher and a little higher and a
34:22 little higher until Sputnik can happen I
34:25 think because we live on earth and
34:28 because we can generally find out the
34:30 amount of pull that the earth creates
34:33 regardless if you're a phenomenon
34:35 [ __ ] gravity person or fully
34:37 explained ether model of gravity you
34:40 still can do the calculation okay great
34:43 so you should be able to calculate how
34:46 to throw something away from a ball
34:49 that's gonna get sucked back to the ball
34:51 and you know it doesn't it's trying to
34:53 fall back to the ball so goes into this
34:55 orbit alright but now here's where we
34:59 need for them especially with Apollo 11
35:01 you can just you could actually
35:03 technically go eight and ten you're in
35:06 orbit around this ball if you take the
35:09 service module and you attach it to the
35:11 lunar module earth it's 2.6 billion
35:13 times bigger than that object okay you
35:17 spend all your fuel your big fuel
35:20 getting into that little orbit 200 miles
35:23 up as all the previous missions stated
35:27 okay now you need to introduce more
35:32 energy sustained to create this
35:36 elliptical slingshot thing and you know
35:42 again for me it becomes the it becomes
35:45 the moon-landing killer when you really
35:49 think about this thing in two hundred
35:51 mile orbit and then all of a sudden it's
35:54 going to start introducing enough force
35:56 to escape the gravity of this ball that
35:59 is 2.6 billion times bigger than this
36:03 thing you have to escape but you're
36:07 gonna have to keep so much fuel and so
36:09 much pressure on this little vehicle
36:12 that you're gonna have to create a
36:13 larger orbit and you're gonna come
36:15 really close to the earth and a large
36:17 orbit and you're gonna have to miss the
36:19 earth again this whole diameter of this
36:23 orbit is gonna have to continually
36:25 increase and increase otherwise you
36:29 would do what you do with the rubberband
36:30 you look at that or abandon it's
36:32 perfectly circular but if you start
36:33 stretching both ends what happens the
36:35 center collapses and if there's a big
36:37 ball inside of that first shape and you
36:40 start introducing power to create a
36:43 larger you know elliptical orbit you're
36:46 gonna crash into Earth so you have to
36:48 constantly put more and more hands
36:51 inside the rubberband to keep the thing
36:53 can you know continually creating this
36:54 elliptical orbit and again I have done
37:00 so many munna episodes as crazy I have
37:02 one up and you know searched on
37:04 thousands of photos to help narrate what
37:07 I'm talking about
37:08 there are sixties NASA animations of
37:12 which I can't put in the videos because
37:14 they'll get copyright strike one of them
37:16 was a somebody in the last 20 years did
37:19 a beautiful animation that looked like a
37:21 50s animation but it was created
37:23 recently I threw that on my videos and
37:25 got nailed
37:26 too bad [ __ ] who didn't exist at the
37:28 time I left everything in giving it to
37:31 bid shoot but I never saw a claim from
37:35 NASA of this increasing elliptical orbit
37:38 all you ever see from the 1860's
37:40 documentation is this thing going around
37:42 the earth and all the sudden it just
37:44 escapes no problem okay well if you have
37:49 enough power to just walk away from the
37:51 earth and literally a tangent line to
37:53 the curve that you're on whyever orbit
37:56 the earth at all just fly straight to
37:58 the moon you have so much power so that
38:01 platform technology has never made sense
38:03 to me and I know what some of you are
38:05 saying not much of a core listeners but
38:08 if you're new you might go hey man well
38:09 we got
38:10 you know we got Rovers on Mars we got
38:13 satellites going out to Titan we got
38:15 things going around Venus and Jupiter
38:18 and Pluto and all this crap no we don't
38:23 and that's why we got to prove the moon
38:26 mission can actually occur which it
38:29 can't in 1969 so that you will
38:32 understand and be able to instantly
38:34 swallow the truth that everything you've
38:36 ever seen on Mars is either in some
38:40 studio somewhere it's some you know
38:44 patch of Greenland you've never seen or
38:47 it's in a computer just that simple out
38:53 of sight out of mind all you're buying
38:55 as a citizen of the world you feel good
38:57 about yourself if these programs make
38:59 you feel high and mighty and you can be
39:01 an employee of one of these companies
39:03 that says they're doing it and you're
39:05 still lost
39:06 you're just again you're allowing black
39:09 boxes to go in your mind science
39:12 unexplained or someone gives you a
39:14 fragment of the algorithm and you're
39:16 like oh yeah I tell any sense no it
39:18 doesn't make them completely prove it in
39:21 some engineering software that doesn't
39:24 know anything about JPL or NASA it's
39:27 just engineering software the one area
39:30 that is the next thing let's just say
39:34 again I think we have him dead to rights
39:36 with the slingshot theory but let's just
39:39 say you know somehow they can fudge all
39:42 the math or hey and you know some
39:45 miracle situation the math works out and
39:48 we could supposedly figure this thing
39:49 out and again you have to believe that a
39:53 rocket engine works in space and I know
39:57 what people think you're thinking well
39:59 there's a cone out there and you create
40:00 a explosion inside the cone and there's
40:03 relative push from the fuel against the
40:07 cone and of course you're gonna travel
40:08 in space-time let me back that up and
40:15 let's do a little experiment you're
40:19 floating in the center of the galaxy
40:23 you're not necessarily close to anything
40:25 so you're not gonna get sucked into a
40:27 star sucked into a planet or a moon you
40:30 don't see anything close by
40:32 looks just like stars all right so you
40:35 see us you see her a star you want to go
40:39 to I guess what you have to do is rotate
40:43 yourself somehow in space right but
40:46 let's just say you could you could you
40:48 could kind of thrust your body and you
40:49 could turn yourself right then I guess
40:52 the only thing you have to do to get
40:53 there is just push on your chest just
40:56 push on your chest that's like I do it's
40:59 relative force from your hand to your
41:00 chest and now you're going towards that
41:02 star yeah anybody want to make a bet if
41:08 that works or not just because it's a
41:12 different shape chest and just because
41:13 it's a it's an explosion of fuel and not
41:17 your hand physics doesn't care hard
41:21 surface force relative force boom I
41:25 don't think it's gonna work but we'll
41:29 give it to them again things can go in
41:33 at lower but because you have thick
41:34 atmosphere as much as you might think
41:35 it's it's too thin for us to breathe and
41:38 all that kind of stuff they are pushing
41:39 off of the earth first then they're just
41:42 literally swimming through this thick
41:44 soup that we call our atmosphere and
41:46 relatively speaking even if you lose
41:50 that friction you'll still have a
41:52 trajectory and if there's nothing there
41:53 to push back at you you're gonna keep
41:55 going it's good but we do have gravity
41:58 at all times
41:59 ether all winds as I go on about if
42:03 you're new to the channel definitely
42:04 check out my episodes on ether and
42:06 gravity go to the website deep thoughts
42:09 radio calm and just search on those
42:11 keywords and you'll be all set up but
42:15 now we have this Van Allen belt thing
42:17 talked about in a million times rain
42:19 well what if we were to say science
42:22 unexplained okay let's have two schools
42:26 of thought here let's not go to JPL NASA
42:30 to have someone explained to us the Van
42:32 Allen belts let's go to a cosmologists
42:34 and say look
42:37 the Sun is throwing these gigantic
42:40 coronal mass ejections at us supposedly
42:44 there's a lot of debris we see you know
42:47 meteor showers all the time one of the
42:50 funny conspiracies about that is what if
42:52 the timed meteor showers which we
42:54 shouldn't actually be able to predict
42:56 because who the hell knows what's in
42:57 space right at any one particular time
43:00 it's just UFOs landing you know it's
43:03 UFOs coming in and so they just tell us
43:04 let's go watch that and then of course
43:06 Pentagon's go on here they go again
43:10 mm-hmm okay so they tell us look because
43:16 we have a magnetic core we're gonna
43:18 disagree about what that is they're
43:19 gonna say nickel-iron if they're not
43:22 electrical universe if their electrical
43:23 universe cosmologists which is the
43:25 cutting-edge cosmology that exists today
43:27 they'll tell you that's an electrical
43:30 core it's just a big plasma ball and
43:32 it's probably empty Tesla again proved
43:35 it in Colorado Springs all right great
43:37 so they will tell you how much energy is
43:42 coming out as gigantic ball and it's
43:47 fighting off everything it fights off
43:49 everything before it gets here hurry if
43:51 I itself all the radiation from the Sun
43:54 that's very powerful I mean it's it's
43:59 not quite as powerful as throwing a
44:00 bowling ball at your head and having a
44:02 bounce off off this you know it's
44:04 forcefield but you could probably throw
44:07 a BB at it and it bounced off and I said
44:09 one tangent right to the curve right now
44:13 I mean perpendicular to the surface
44:14 right okay so we get all this
44:17 radioactive radiation principals from
44:20 one group and then we take it over to
44:21 NASA and we say okay quarter inch
44:24 aluminum aluminum of which has never
44:28 been in any list of metals that were
44:31 protect us from radiation it has never
44:34 been used in history that I know of to
44:38 protect a human being for mediation and
44:42 of course the rest of it fabric and all
44:44 kinds of other stuff that's nothing the
44:47 only Steel's that really work would be
44:50 something
44:50 extremely heavy lead maybe if you could
44:53 make it out of uranium right insulating
44:56 it with water six inches of water was
44:58 what the guy from NASA told me in 91 but
45:02 that doesn't protect you against the Van
45:03 Allen belts that just protects against
45:04 ambient radiation from the Sun without a
45:07 coronal mass ejection hitting you the
45:09 funny thing is when I was told that in
45:11 91 I didn't have any precedence in my
45:15 brain for a problem that needed to be
45:18 solved but this guy was talking all
45:19 about it amazing so you get the registry
45:24 of the theorized amount of radiation
45:27 which supposedly Project Orion flew once
45:29 figured out what it was and then
45:31 immediately marked the data classified
45:33 first time in history that the natural
45:37 universe has been classified it's
45:40 classified because it's absolutely
45:42 positively mega lethal they can't have
45:46 you knowing that because then everything
45:48 that they have been lying to us about
45:50 falls apart and when that falls apart
45:53 the organization falls apart if we go
45:56 for criminal justice well a bunch of
45:58 people get arrested for lying and
46:00 perpetuating lies that'd be a big giant
46:04 prison wouldn't it that's the NASA
46:06 prison over there
46:07 that's JPL prison over there and that's
46:10 the subcontractor prisons over there
46:13 amazing there's no way in hell that the
46:18 1969 capsule of the service module could
46:23 have protected these astronauts from
46:24 radiation all the film that they brought
46:28 up they went through the Van Allen belts
46:30 supposedly would have been exposed there
46:33 wouldn't have been any pictures on the
46:34 moon Michael Collins camera well if you
46:37 know you know Buzz Aldrin twisting a
46:40 tuna can but never would have come back
46:42 home because it might work at 200 miles
46:45 up maybe probably but it wouldn't work
46:51 once it went through the Van Allen belts
46:53 that I'll be overexposed Madame Curie
46:57 she figured out radiation existed in
46:59 uranium bars because film was getting
47:01 developed the
47:02 it's it's light-sensitive you know light
47:05 prevention envelope because she put a
47:09 bar on top of it went home came back
47:12 used the film later and boom there's a
47:14 bar spot on all of the pictures because
47:17 just the radiation off a piece of
47:18 uranium which is nothing okay a piece of
47:22 uranium has what's called metal
47:23 shielding it automatically has less
47:27 radiation than when it's pulverized into
47:29 an aerosol like a 14-inch
47:32 a10 depleted uranium round a stuffs mega
47:36 lethal still we're talking about a
47:39 fraction of a percent of a fraction
47:42 compared to the Van Allen belts plus
47:45 there's some laws of physics which say
47:47 that you know was it the third rule of
47:50 thermodynamics talks about how you know
47:54 hot is attracted to cold and so even
47:57 though the atmosphere is very sparse and
48:00 the particles are very far away from
48:01 each other you slam some vehicle going
48:04 thirty five thousand miles an hour so
48:06 through this environment you're gonna
48:09 have all of these supercharged particles
48:11 that are while they're sitting there for
48:13 hit forty hundred forty eight hundred
48:14 degrees Fahrenheit or maybe it's even
48:17 Celsius it's some insane amount of
48:19 energy and heat it might liquefy the
48:22 vehicle if you go too quickly through it
48:25 so I some people don't believe
48:27 everything they say about satellites but
48:30 again we go to the next situation the
48:33 platform has to endure which is ambient
48:36 radiation from the Sun all right we
48:39 should figure that out that's probably
48:40 one of the most unreported piece of
48:43 science out there but the guy in front
48:46 of me I had two guys in front of me in
48:48 ninety one for those who've never seen
48:49 an episode debrief me about the fact
48:53 that they were on the Mars project one
48:55 of them looked deeply for the saturn v
48:58 apollo platform i think he said
49:01 something around three months someone
49:03 pulled him aside and said we never went
49:05 stop searching we're not going to mars
49:07 in your lifetime take your paycheck and
49:09 shut up you will invent things so you're
49:11 not gonna be completely useless he
49:14 stayed for several years
49:16 he ended up quitting a year before the
49:18 guy next to him these are buddies and he
49:20 got his buddy a job but where I worked
49:22 and he looks to his buddy and says what
49:24 was the last thing they said to you or
49:27 that you found out or whatever and he
49:29 talked about the six inches of water
49:31 necessary around a capsule to insulate
49:35 against just ambient radiation from the
49:38 Sun I mean think about it
49:41 what is happening on earth during the
49:44 day well the Sun warms us we all know
49:47 that but if you think about all the
49:50 different processes that have to take
49:52 place for that to become a reality it's
49:56 mind-blowing you know again you know I'm
50:01 saying this with a little bit of like
50:03 skepticism in my own mind you know
50:06 somehow the moon completely perfectly
50:08 stays facing us through thousands and
50:10 thousands of years it never ever rotates
50:12 that seems a little odd
50:14 supposedly nASA says the moon is
50:16 actually drifting away that's completely
50:19 against the laws of physics it's too big
50:22 for our planet so that's really weird I
50:24 got a whole episode on the moon you
50:26 should go check it out if you want to
50:27 think about the moon being something
50:29 different than what they say but this
50:31 Sun is supposedly 93 million miles away
50:33 during the Eclipse supposedly you know
50:35 during eclipse 100% the moon blocks the
50:38 Sun it's unbelievable how's that so
50:41 perfectly aligned maybe we are in a
50:44 matrix for all I know but this Sun
50:46 according to their you know official
50:50 science is barfing out all of these
50:54 agitated waves of energy which we call
50:58 photons and it's traveling a really long
51:02 distance still staying a very vibrant
51:05 and so it's friction is going to create
51:08 the heat right but it's got to punch
51:10 through the Van Allen belts first
51:13 photons are pretty badass when it talks
51:16 about an electron cloud stopping a
51:18 photon it doesn't really work that well
51:20 but here it comes through now it hits us
51:23 well at first it hits all of our liquid
51:25 air you know we have a very thick oxygen
51:30 even though it's not that thick relative
51:32 to the size of the earth and then it
51:34 hits us boom we get some little was at
51:37 the pituitary gland we get a little bit
51:39 of vitamin D we stay healthy it's
51:40 awesome all right so of course if you're
51:45 just out there floating in the soup that
51:48 is the ether o winds of the universe and
51:51 you're hit by this gigantic ball in
51:53 space especially if you want to go
51:55 official science you don't have any
51:57 other theory for the shape of the earth
51:59 you don't believe in expanding earth you
52:01 have you're just totally an official
52:03 science person that's the platform
52:05 called the helicopter but if your
52:09 official science then you have to
52:11 acknowledge the power of the Sun and you
52:13 just being right there in front of it
52:16 okay now I will say that the the next
52:20 part of our platform technology we have
52:24 some pretty reliable science ok you know
52:27 it is any of you've downloaded an
52:29 astronomy app on your phone and you turn
52:33 your GPS on and you turn all your
52:35 gyroscopes on which are already on
52:37 anyway but you hold it up especially the
52:39 iPad one which is really cool and he
52:41 just you know you pointed at the stars
52:42 and it's not exactly perfect it's a
52:44 little sluggish but overall it you know
52:46 if you're like what's that bright star
52:48 I'm looking at you hold it up oh it's
52:50 Venus it's a planet oh my god it's Mars
52:53 its Jupiter ok where the moon is going
52:58 to be in any one particular time I think
53:01 is fairly easy mathematics I really do
53:06 so in terms of plugging in where Cape
53:11 Canaveral is how fast an object is
53:14 moving and then again if you can make up
53:17 these other issues of the slingshot and
53:20 then getting to this big radiation belt
53:21 at the same exact time and you have to
53:24 remember while you're doing the
53:25 slingshot Theory you're being chewed up
53:28 by the Van Allen belt so you're not just
53:30 gonna punch straight through this 25,000
53:33 mile thick thing you're going through it
53:35 and you're coming out of it you're going
53:37 through it and you're coming out of it I
53:38 mean it's gonna be eating you alive
53:40 before you ever get there
53:42 it was really funny I just saw a video
53:46 on YouTube of my loungy of the day and
53:48 it said you know 10 of the most remote
53:50 places in the world if you go watch
53:52 those videos you know it's an eye-opener
53:55 when you think about radiation there is
53:58 I believe the tallest but they said that
54:01 it's so high that the radiation that
54:05 these employees are exposed to is was
54:09 monitored and then they Dean four or
54:11 five other places that are way higher
54:12 and it was always the amount of
54:14 radiation amount of radiation one of
54:16 these places has only opened a few
54:17 months out of the year because the
54:18 radiation is so high and you're still on
54:21 the surface of the earth for God's sake
54:23 okay but now you got to catch up with
54:26 the moon and you've got to not hit it
54:31 you've got to get close to it now again
54:35 if they could actually prove they could
54:37 do this slingshot thing and you know
54:40 they could get close to the moon but you
54:44 have to understand if there's any
54:46 anomaly in the engine or it might burp a
54:50 little bit if there's any anomaly in the
54:53 atmosphere during this whole process
54:55 it's thicker it's lighter it's thicker
54:57 it's lighter air pocket no pocket dense
54:59 pocket whatever then you're going to
55:02 have a lot of adjusting to do at these
55:05 microscopic levels and when you're
55:08 traveling 270 thousand miles away on
55:10 average we're talking about a lot of
55:13 adjustments and we're not going straight
55:15 so it's millions of miles as what
55:19 they're traveling because they're going
55:20 around the earth round the earth right
55:21 here then they go way way out there to
55:23 the moon I don't know it should be close
55:25 to a million or something by the time
55:27 they get there it's definitely more than
55:30 237 okay so now they're gonna get sucked
55:34 into the gravity of the Moon now they
55:38 have told us a long time ago that the
55:42 moon has 1/6 the gravity as earth all
55:45 right does that make sense well again if
55:49 a core of a round object in space
55:50 displaces X amount of ether then you're
55:54 going to get X amount of gravity
55:55 period the only thing that would change
55:57 that is if somehow the moon and all of
56:01 its glory is not as opaque as the earth
56:06 when it comes to particles going through
56:08 it if it's a little bit permeable a
56:10 little bit more ether goes through it
56:12 and then you think then you're gonna
56:13 have less gravity than you think but
56:16 because it does orbit the earth and it
56:18 has a particular diameter we can measure
56:20 just don't use a Sexton because then the
56:24 world turns flat and the Sun is not that
56:27 far away I always thought that was
56:29 amazing let's say we could give him a
56:32 little mulligan on the gravity of the
56:37 moon because if they had any of that
56:38 wrong then all of their trajectories all
56:43 of their mathematics would collapse if
56:46 it wasn't as heavy as they thought it
56:47 was or had as much gravity I should say
56:50 they're probably gonna shoot overshoot
56:53 it and just be floating in space I mean
56:55 talk about being screwed if it's heavier
56:58 than they think they're gonna crash into
57:00 it so they absolutely positively have to
57:03 have something that works and the weird
57:05 thing was first time they ever went out
57:08 there which I think was Apollo 8 it
57:10 worked the first time so their
57:13 calculations were absolutely immaculate
57:14 the first time but would you really do
57:17 that would you really send a human being
57:19 the first time if all this whole thing
57:22 is just a hodgepodge of mathematics run
57:24 by a rope memory computer why not send
57:27 the first thing out there without a
57:29 human being just see if you can
57:31 slingshot it around because what in your
57:35 life have you done for the very first
57:36 time that has that level of complexity
57:40 and variables that might go wrong where
57:44 you nailed it the first time without
57:46 being completely serendipitous I doubt
57:49 anything and there's this theory that as
57:54 long as you have enough brains thinking
57:56 about something you will never have any
57:59 issues right you're just gonna think
58:01 about it enough and it's gonna work hmm
58:05 maybe maybe
58:08 best intentions right now what's also
58:12 interesting about the moon mission at
58:13 this point when they're going into
58:16 essentially low orbit around the moon is
58:20 that you don't see any at least I've
58:24 never seen it
58:25 and I've never heard of theorized
58:27 perhaps I've just this has been a blind
58:29 spot to all my particularly search and
58:31 listening to people talk about it you
58:34 never really hear about any major
58:37 maneuvers once they got there there
58:40 wasn't like oh [ __ ] we're gonna worry
58:41 too fast towards this you know surface
58:42 hit the booster and move it around no
58:45 it's perfect Michael Collins up there
58:48 who stayed up there the whole time maybe
58:50 you know then they get to get into orbit
58:52 and it's a you know it's it's a
58:53 countdown situation right yeah I mean
58:56 even if it happened in real life we'd
58:58 have to get you know we're here now get
59:01 over there into the lunar module I'm
59:03 gonna shut the door and then we're gonna
59:06 do the separation and then you're gonna
59:08 go down to the moon I mean you can't be
59:09 messing around because you have limited
59:11 of everything limited fuel them as the
59:13 oxygen limited food etc etc but all this
59:19 radiation that they're worried about in
59:20 observatories and high altitude
59:22 locations where people just hang out
59:25 okay well it's way worse out there
59:29 we just know that for a fact and at this
59:31 point the second that get past these
59:32 super lethal I don't know how many
59:35 million times more lethal the Van Allen
59:37 belts would be than ambient radiation
59:38 from the Sun but it's got to be several
59:42 orders of magnitude over again they
59:45 magically survived the microwave now
59:49 they're out there completely unshielded
59:51 for the entire journey the only thing
59:54 they could probably reduce a little bit
59:56 of the radiation for Michael Collins
59:57 would be as he's orbiting the moon when
60:01 he gets on the backside of the moon from
60:04 the Sun he's got moon protection that'd
60:06 be about it and my model of ether winds
60:09 he is still being crucified by radiation
60:13 but maybe it's more photon waves and
60:16 ultraviolet and x-rays and things coming
60:19 off the Sun that is the most lethal
60:21 species and
60:22 maybe ether moves through and with no
60:23 problems just like it's doing to me
60:24 right now okay we don't have the math
60:30 written down as to how all this works
60:33 flawlessly and for me if you can achieve
60:37 that much complexity your very first try
60:41 my god what are we doing here burning
60:44 oil burning natural gas what are we
60:47 doing with computers that I still have a
60:50 I still have a completion bar well the
60:54 reason while that those difficulties
60:56 still exist at least in part is because
60:59 we're not as advanced as NASA would like
61:02 you to think that we are and I want to
61:04 stop for a second and draw a comparison
61:06 to war where else do we see
61:10 unadulterated technology the best
61:14 technology we see it in war videos we
61:18 hear about it from our friends who come
61:20 back from Desert Storm and tell us they
61:22 Waris basically a stealth suit and the
61:27 stealth suit is actually evolved over
61:29 time the initial stealth suits they wore
61:31 in Desert Storm were hiding any of their
61:35 body heat signatures if you but if you
61:39 saw them you would see them now I
61:42 believe we actually have 100% stealth
61:44 technology and there's a there's an
61:46 amazing video out there that's never
61:48 been claimed to be a hoax where this
61:50 tank is going down an alley broad
61:53 daylight and here comes this human
61:55 figure running which obviously that
61:58 character if he exists and if that's
61:59 real has no equipment on his body
62:01 whatsoever he just has the stealth suit
62:03 on but he runs up to the tank the tank
62:05 has a lid that pops up his character
62:07 jumps in and the tank stops full-on
62:10 Predator technology okay so say we have
62:15 that now still nowhere close to the
62:19 amount of variables and perfection that
62:22 the moon landing would have required
62:24 even Apollo 8 which just circled the
62:26 moon and came back now what is the
62:29 difference in magnitude between simply
62:33 orbiting the moon and coming back and
62:34 actually going to
62:36 and pulling off this extra maneuver and
62:38 going down to the moon landing safely
62:40 getting out messing around and coming
62:43 back up as hard as putting a service
62:46 module around the moon might be I think
62:50 the lunar module story is I've been
62:57 abusing the phrase but I think it is an
62:59 order of magnitude over the service
63:03 module which means exponential it is
63:06 several times more difficult to do the
63:09 lunar module thing and again what have
63:13 we ever done in history that we
63:16 succeeded on something so difficult the
63:18 very first time as bart sibrel setting
63:21 as I've said in the episode he noted the
63:23 fact that even though we had airplanes
63:26 from at least 1907 really item in 1904
63:30 our 1903 actually or something like that
63:33 you know three but we had airplanes
63:35 completely figured out we had fought
63:37 several wars with them from the biplanes
63:40 of the Red Baron to you know
63:43 propeller planes propeller planes twice
63:45 where were won World War two you have
63:48 jets that the debut and Korea Vietnam
63:53 commercial airlines this stuff was
63:57 figured out before we tried to make the
64:00 747 I believe bart sibrel number is over
64:05 a hundred and sixty attempts to get the
64:07 747 to fly the very first time so try it
64:13 it doesn't work redesign it try it again
64:16 that happened to over 160 times for the
64:19 747 and I believe he said it took like
64:22 16 years or something like that when you
64:25 talk about platform technology this is
64:27 the perfect example the platform of
64:31 flight with jet propulsion technology
64:35 was already figured out with several
64:38 other models but the latest one because
64:40 we didn't have computer simulation like
64:41 the 787 which flies the very first time
64:44 as I understand it we didn't have that
64:47 technology but they go to the moon
64:50 back in 1969 technology oh we've never
64:53 been able to recreate it since 1972 for
64:56 50 years now we've never been able to do
64:59 it again give me a break so the lunar
65:03 module platform okay relies on a bunch
65:06 of assumptions it relies on the
65:09 assumption that one you can even fit
65:12 inside that vehicle what you need to
65:14 survive for you know I forgot what it
65:19 was by Apollo 17 Apollo 17 took 12 days
65:24 and 13 hours to complete which means
65:28 every single breath taken by three men
65:30 was compensated by what's inside the
65:33 vehicle their food their water 12 days
65:39 and 13 hours okay
65:42 Apollo 11 they were out for eight days
65:48 okay sure sure whatever what do you want
65:52 make it fifty days why don't we so here
65:55 comes this rickety thing but again once
65:58 you look at the photographs of it it's
66:00 it's really embarrassing you know the
66:05 the outer container wasn't sealed
66:07 properly right you've got all this weird
66:09 flat black
66:11 you know wrinkled panels but then to
66:13 make it look really space-age they got
66:15 this copper paint you know stuff all
66:17 over the legs and again I can't go into
66:20 all the stuff that is absolutely
66:22 ludicrous that is the evidence go see my
66:24 other episodes but it breaks off and of
66:28 course Rockets work in space it's just
66:30 doing these little tiny you know retro
66:33 engines to rotate it around then poof it
66:35 pushes down and it's hauling ass it
66:40 really is you see the footage out the
66:42 window
66:43 they are moving and and suddenly with
66:48 really virtually no explanation at all
66:51 besides Rockets work in space without an
66:53 atmosphere this thing again is blowing
66:56 against nothing and it's slowing down
66:59 would have been interesting for the
67:01 astronauts to kind of jump up in the air
67:02 and push on each other
67:03 been cool if I'm gonna fall and broken
67:06 their neck even if it was real but this
67:09 thing lands it lands hard and again
67:12 there's no skid marks on on the little
67:15 footprints there's no dust on the
67:17 footprints even though you saw metric
67:20 tons of dust move out from under this
67:21 10,000 pound thrust engine man none of
67:24 it got on the vehicle unbelievable but
67:26 every time you see the astronauts
67:27 jumping around they're covered in soot
67:30 with just one jump the lunar module
67:33 although much bigger than you might
67:35 think it is the Rocketdyne engines that
67:40 they invented at that time always have a
67:44 gigantic like I'm on what I don't want
67:46 they call it but it's the fuel injection
67:48 system rate it's a system that that
67:51 routes the fuel down through the cone if
67:54 you take the average size of one of the
67:57 engines above the cone it's way up
68:00 inside the living cabin of where these
68:02 astronauts are supposed to be the doors
68:05 aren't big enough to let the astronauts
68:06 out it's like a completely failed
68:08 platform just before you actually
68:11 introduce the elements of the moon and
68:15 one side of its gonna be really super
68:17 mega hot the other side's gonna be super
68:19 mega cold you have these spacesuits on
68:23 their inflated you're gonna go out in
68:26 ultra radiation right again just go
68:30 watch all those episodes on YouTube
68:31 about radiation and altitude
68:33 observatories well if these astronauts
68:36 can walk around on the moon with a super
68:40 volatile radiation plus a massive amount
68:42 of heat and cold there's no reason why
68:44 those observatories can't be open 24
68:46 hours a day 365 days a year because hey
68:50 all they gotta do is wear a little bit
68:52 of plastic and rubber and clothing and
68:55 they can just be up there forever in
68:56 fact according to NASA all they have to
69:00 do is build a living quarters down below
69:02 with quarter inch aluminum containers
69:05 and as astronomers can be just fine as a
69:09 matter of fact they just need to build
69:12 planes out of a quarter inch aluminum
69:15 which
69:16 some of them are right and then you know
69:19 the little um I forgot what they call it
69:23 but it's a little lapel pin that all
69:26 flight personnel have to wear from
69:28 flight attendants to pilots they have to
69:30 wear this little clip and in jet pilots
69:33 and military pilots they all have to
69:35 wear this little clip and the clip
69:36 compresses between two sandwiches of
69:38 Steel a piece of film straight up film
69:41 Kodak right and then they take those
69:44 things off and they developed the film
69:46 and they realize how much radiation
69:48 exposure you've had and they keep a
69:50 little tab in a database and once you
69:53 reach your maximum exposure you can't
69:55 fly anymore done deal
69:56 it's a whole lot okay you can still have
69:59 a pilot with twenty thousand dollars
70:00 plus but there is a limit according
70:04 these videos about you know
70:08 observatories I don't know there are
70:12 mountains that are so high that you know
70:15 they're like fifteen thousand feet is
70:17 one of them mmm that's roughly three
70:20 miles up but you know their flight only
70:22 for a citizen usually lasts you know
70:24 anywhere between one hour and maybe if
70:27 you're an international flyer 14 hours
70:31 tops and I do want to just throw out
70:34 there a slight digression because if you
70:38 are a member of the Facebook page for
70:40 deep thoughts radio just go to the
70:42 website there's a link up there I hear
70:45 this thing all the time that you know
70:47 the the Flat Earth community says that
70:49 we don't fly over the Pacific this is
70:52 why you don't fly over the Pacific okay
70:54 I went to Australia last year in August
70:57 I took off out of LAX and I flew
71:01 directly to Sydney right over the ocean
71:03 I think at one point we could see Hawaii
71:06 so we did fly directly over the Pacific
71:09 Ocean and directly at Australia and
71:11 according to the Flat Earth model my
71:13 trip would have been what 36 hours or
71:15 some crazy thing and it's not possible
71:19 so you may want to drop that particular
71:21 one because I got there in I don't know
71:25 it's like 10 hours 11 hours something
71:28 like that whoo
71:29 Virgin Atlantic or virgin virgin lady
71:32 Virgin Australia so when you say I can't
71:35 find a ticket that flies it will just go
71:37 virgin it's the only virgin I think that
71:39 he remains after he sold the whole thing
71:41 off it's a great airline by the way oh
71:45 my god
71:46 but the lunar module has more
71:49 requirements than all the other
71:50 platforms even the space suit which has
71:54 a lot of responsibilities doesn't have
71:56 as much as the lunar module does because
71:59 what's the lunar module have to do it
72:01 has to separate from the service module
72:03 it has to turn around it has to go down
72:05 it has to survive and align with the
72:07 ground you know again if there was one
72:10 rock in the way this thing would have
72:13 tipped over if it ever tips over no to
72:15 human beings at one-sixth gravity are
72:17 ever gonna be able to ratchet that thing
72:19 back up and you got two dead astronauts
72:21 eventually yeah just imagine the imagine
72:24 the story of that whole thing if that
72:26 were to occur it hits a little rock on
72:30 one of its four feet and it tips over
72:33 because you don't know you don't know
72:35 you can't see the the moon's surface at
72:37 that level of detail
72:39 you can't not even with reconnaissance
72:41 satellites from 8 and 10 you can't see
72:44 it that detailed so the guy in the
72:49 service module would have to go adios I
72:52 love your brothers see you later and he
72:54 goes back to earth and those guys die
72:57 hardcore right thank God it was in a
73:00 Hollywood basement ok but it has to land
73:03 they get out and how they're just in the
73:05 spacesuit platform but the lunar module
73:08 still has to support their life as they
73:10 go in and out and then you have this
73:13 amazing if it wasn't difficult enough to
73:18 land on the moon and I don't know
73:20 technically speaking which would be more
73:22 difficult landing on the moon or this
73:24 one crazy crapshoot that worked 6 out of
73:28 6 times it's it's like insane it's
73:31 insane to assert that this is possible
73:34 right
73:35 I'll give you an analogy that's YouTube
73:38 based
73:40 I bet nearly every single one of you
73:42 have seen at one point in the last 15 20
73:45 years these amazing videos that these
73:47 kids create that are actually
73:49 compilations of one-in-a-million
73:51 situations where they'll be sitting down
73:56 at a chair and they just throw something
73:57 behind them and it falls in the trashcan
73:59 or I mean they have super elaborate ones
74:02 where they throw a CD across the room
74:04 and it falls into a CD player and
74:06 somehow it closes and plays the CD I
74:09 mean just amazing crazy things throwing
74:11 dishes and they happen to land on the
74:12 dishwasher perfectly obviously they're
74:14 breaking tons of glasses there they're
74:17 missing the trashcan 5,200 times before
74:21 they get it all right course the more
74:22 complex the problem the more they have
74:24 to try the ones were the guys throw the
74:27 basketball like a million miles and then
74:30 it hits swooshes that is nothing nothing
74:36 compared to what the lunar module
74:37 platform claims to be able to do which
74:41 is you have some explosive charges that
74:46 are go off underneath this thing and it
74:48 just blasts this thing straight up into
74:51 space you've seen the footage that they
74:54 submitted is real so this thing is going
74:57 straight up into the atmosphere it
75:01 doesn't have any orbital properties
75:02 about it at all but the service modules
75:06 going in an orbit okay and technically
75:10 speaking its orbit is the same speed
75:13 that it came off of the Earth's orbit at
75:15 what would have slowed it down all right
75:18 they don't have any booster going the
75:19 other way as far as I know I've never
75:22 heard and correct me Amir if you've
75:24 heard different they would have to turn
75:25 around hit the booster slow itself down
75:28 turn around then be ready for this thing
75:31 but this thing is so perfectly timed out
75:34 that by the time it gets into space
75:36 there's a service module and supposedly
75:39 they're going the same speed but bolts
75:42 you know are explosives underneath
75:43 they're gonna shoot it straight up
75:45 perpendicular to the surface of the Moon
75:47 it's not going to go in any type of
75:49 orbit but that that maneuver that
75:52 rendezvous
75:54 is an orbital rendezvous you see it in
75:57 their footage man here comes this top
76:00 half of the lunar module and the moon is
76:02 moving underneath how did it get orbital
76:05 movement it's not what you see then you
76:10 might say oh it's got a little retro
76:11 rockets those little things look like
76:12 mixers at the bar right has there's a
76:16 little Lego that has that on there too
76:17 right by the way I just saw that amazing
76:21 documentary on Netflix I think it's
76:23 called the toys that made us and you go
76:25 look at the the Lego one and it's just
76:28 an amazing story about the Lego
76:30 franchise which I guess means play well
76:34 Lego and they cut the words off and
76:36 mixed them together but this thing
76:39 rendevouz at this I don't know you know
76:43 there's probably a few of you listening
76:45 that are really good at statistics and
76:47 probability I went through it I went
76:51 through it and on my own and didn't you
76:54 know really have any application for it
76:55 when I finally was working with the guys
76:58 when we were architecting EA comm we
77:00 were trying to figure out what the
77:02 statistics the probability of
77:03 functionality was for 20 million
77:05 consecutive users as the first time I
77:07 ever used it in my life and the last
77:09 time I ever used it so anyway but those
77:11 of you who could figure out all the
77:13 variables and then put a put odds
77:16 against I think it would be a very
77:19 sobering moment for anyone who believes
77:22 that we landed on the moon but again we
77:25 just swallow this stuff
77:27 it's unexplained science you know and
77:31 I'm what if I present that and someone
77:33 just goes well it just uh it just sped
77:36 up it just sped up in space as it's
77:38 going up and again what would be what
77:41 would be the the full path of that lunar
77:46 module top capsule area if the service
77:50 module never picked it up well it's
77:52 blasting straight up in the air and it
77:55 would go way up there but then it would
77:57 come back down and crash so is this
78:00 things going up it's also got this fuzzy
78:03 logic
78:06 crescendo of speed you see it in their
78:09 footage it comes up and it slows down
78:11 perfectly attaches perfectly hey guys
78:14 come on over and then throw it away
78:17 which I never ever heard them claim this
78:21 but we're not supposed to be you know
78:24 one of our prime directives and NASA's
78:27 we're not supposed to be you know
78:28 polluting the surface of any foreign
78:30 planet before we get there or moon or
78:32 whatever and but these things would have
78:34 gone back down and crashed somewhere on
78:37 the moon's surface and that should be
78:38 somewhere in some reconnaissance picture
78:41 it's a big giant piece of steel and it
78:43 should have a little you know unlike all
78:46 the fake craters on the moon which are
78:48 actually volcanic explosions you'd have
78:50 that Superman trail right it would hit
78:52 the ground and then whatever why it
78:55 would have a Superman trail because
78:57 magically without any explanation that
78:59 I've ever heard it achieved orbital
79:01 speed so it could rendezvous with the
79:03 service module if you think about the
79:07 scan that we were willing to buy because
79:09 we wanted to believe in it 1969 and up
79:13 it's no wonder we have like snake oil
79:16 guys and and scammers everywhere and why
79:19 it still works hi I'm the IRS I need you
79:23 to give me twenty thousand dollars in
79:24 iTunes gift cards oh that sounds legit
79:27 sure boom I don't know why I got scammed
79:30 because the IRS doesn't take iPhone or
79:33 sorry
79:34 iTunes gift cards how about that you
79:36 know how about they don't even call you
79:37 and you know just as a digression on
79:40 that one because it does apply to the
79:43 moon mission thing I've had friends of
79:46 mine get scammed by that gift card thing
79:51 they caught themselves in the middle of
79:53 doing it or gave me a call I think and I
79:56 said no no no don't do that
79:57 oh okay and then it just vanishes right
80:00 you know one comes to get their door to
80:03 take them at gunpoint to go pay the IRS
80:05 at some Bank never happens but it
80:09 happened again to the same person and
80:11 the same person was right in the middle
80:13 of falling for it when I came over to
80:15 visit one day and he's like aw man as a
80:18 person but it was a different scam it
80:19 was I
80:20 the first time I think and then it was
80:21 I've secured your computer and you know
80:24 you won't be able to get anything off
80:26 and I should give me your money and I'm
80:27 like was your computer working yep
80:29 is it a Mac yep and we just didn't do it
80:33 and everything was fine but it's amazing
80:38 why would say to as you get older this
80:41 is kind of scary your frontal lobe is
80:44 very important to your ability to
80:47 discern reality your toxicity in your
80:51 body is very important when you want
80:53 your brain to work correctly if those
80:56 things ever get damaged or polluted or
80:59 both mm-hmm
81:01 all this stuff might start making sense
81:03 when you get older well yeah we did go
81:06 the moon why not I need a good feeling
81:08 today and again I think I did an episode
81:12 about you know why we have to believe in
81:15 the moon mission or the people that do
81:17 and I'm very Cavalier on this show I'm
81:25 very you know let it all hang out what
81:27 I'm talking about this and I insult
81:30 anyone who believes in certain things
81:32 but I don't really mean it for everyone
81:35 I believe that the audience that watches
81:36 this show already believes it so I'm not
81:39 offending anyone but for those who need
81:43 to believe there's a lot of things going
81:46 on in their mind and quite frankly just
81:51 as your child may need to believe in
81:53 Santa Claus when they're young because
81:55 it may be they're living in a tormented
81:57 world that you're unaware of because
81:58 you're not paying attention to them or
82:00 you're the dick being a dick to them you
82:02 personally but those people bad parents
82:05 maybe the Santa Claus you know I would
82:08 say this Fred Rogers who's Mister Rogers
82:12 he absolutely positively proved this
82:15 with people coming up to him 20 years
82:17 after he started to show weeping in line
82:20 as adults and saying there's a if you
82:23 watch that documentary on him on HBO it
82:25 is worth the subscription HBO or just
82:28 rent it but this woman came up to him
82:31 and was
82:33 so excited to meet him in Lion of course
82:35 he's a sweetheart so he's meeting her
82:37 and she starts kind of sobbing through
82:39 the conversation because she said you
82:41 know my home life sucked and when you
82:45 said that I was special that made me who
82:51 I was today you gave me a beacon to and
82:53 a reason they didn't have any
82:55 qualifications you gave me unconditional
82:57 love but a reason to believe in myself
83:00 that I was special I hadn't found out
83:03 exactly what was gonna make me special
83:04 but you told me that I just need to find
83:07 it don't sit on your butt but you just
83:10 had to find it and so we don't know
83:13 everyone's issues in life for them maybe
83:18 everything else has gone wrong in their
83:20 entire life and it's a bit of an
83:21 exaggeration but there's probably a few
83:23 out there and the moon mission and their
83:26 knowledge of the moon mission as it was
83:28 portrayed to them is their one calling
83:31 card it's the one thing that makes them
83:35 special not only inside but it makes
83:38 them special to everyone who's
83:39 google-eyed about how many facts they
83:42 remembered that NASA told them was true
83:44 so do we need to you know confront a
83:48 person like that and say oh my god
83:50 you're so lost you're so Baba nah we
83:53 don't let him believe let them totally
83:56 buy it but do you young folks that are
83:59 gonna be running the world in five to
84:01 ten years hmm you don't want a country
84:06 built out of false patriotism you know
84:09 if they if you allow your country to
84:11 tell you lies to make you feel
84:13 comfortable with your country probably
84:18 not a good idea
84:19 let's let's let's compare it to
84:21 something else that may be more real but
84:27 it's also bad news so we know the Native
84:30 Americans used to exist here in plenty'
84:32 they owned
84:34 North America period no interpretation
84:38 was their land
84:39 here comes Europe they're trying to
84:43 escape tyranny which is just it's it's
84:46 such an acidic
84:47 reason to be here it's sort of like how
84:51 I think Americans feel when people South
84:53 America allow their countries to go to
84:54 [ __ ] and then they want to migrate up
84:56 and infect America benefit from all of
85:00 the folks that fought for the
85:02 Constitution but you're worried that
85:06 like okay you have no backbone to fight
85:08 your own country fight for your own land
85:10 but you want to be in my world and in
85:13 fact the strong bone structure we have
85:16 which is supported by the Constitution I
85:18 don't trust you I don't trust you to
85:20 defend my Constitution because you won't
85:22 defend your own country yeah you should
85:25 die trying and you find out you won't
85:27 even have to die just stand up but
85:30 you're gonna have to go on a group right
85:31 but we came over here cuz we screwed up
85:34 Europe you know the old phrase Indian
85:36 giver was about us it wasn't about them
85:39 they loaned us a bunch of stuff because
85:41 we didn't bring what we needed and then
85:44 when they were like okay we just loaned
85:45 it to you we didn't give it to you they
85:48 wanted their stuff back and then we
85:49 started calling them Indian givers isn't
85:52 that great but we are responsible for
85:55 the wholesale slaughter and near
85:57 genocide of the Native Americans it's
86:02 not a it's not a bright spot in the
86:03 history of America now there's just only
86:08 you know there's there's I I don't know
86:10 what the percentage is I think it's
86:11 below 50% and by a large margin
86:14 of actual people who are real related to
86:17 anyone who ever did that but we still
86:20 benefit from the spoils of those events
86:24 occurring as much as they tell you it
86:26 was smallpox and influenza that's just a
86:29 cover story we slaughtered it was
86:33 horrible so there are situations that we
86:37 can't take back
86:38 but the moon mission is something we
86:41 could take back if it was fake we can at
86:44 least set that correct don't you want to
86:47 say you know look if someone confronts
86:49 me personally with you know the Native
86:53 Americans with slavery
86:57 I have methods of answering that I
87:00 personally would never engage in
87:04 something like that again I mean I gotta
87:06 do anything in the first time but I
87:07 wouldn't I wouldn't do that
87:09 we have evolved way past that whole
87:12 thing at a huge expense to other people
87:15 slavery as I say all the time you have
87:17 to remember the people that brought him
87:20 over went back to Europe
87:23 the average American did not have money
87:25 to buy a slave only European plantation
87:29 owners did otherwise known as Democrats
87:32 and then of course you have Yankees that
87:36 would have slaves to pull them out of
87:38 poverty and that's where you get the
87:40 pictures of them wearing suits and
87:42 dresses and yes they were not free but
87:46 as I understand it by the way General
87:48 Lee who was a Confederate was also not
87:51 keen on slavery but the moon is its own
87:54 special thing it's a modern-day thing we
87:58 should know better than to believe it we
88:00 should know better than to support it do
88:03 I blame anybody back in the day for
88:04 believing it hell no hell no maybe a
88:08 super brilliant scientist but that's why
88:11 there's so many of you who comment in
88:13 the comment section someone recently and
88:17 within the last six months said my
88:18 grandmother never believed we went to
88:21 the moon and I I would love to meet that
88:24 lady
88:24 I'm sure she's long gone but geez wow
88:27 what an incredible woman to look at that
88:30 and go in ample [ __ ] but the only reason
88:33 that we are allowed to believe this is
88:35 because we have unexplained science
88:37 inside black boxes you know I'm not
88:42 smart enough to know that and so ok it
88:44 must be real and watch me take my you
88:47 know finger off here right pull a coin
88:50 out of your ear and so you know we've
88:54 we've talked about this a lot I've got
88:56 about five minutes left on the stick so
88:57 I want to kind of finish off with this
88:59 further study of the intellectual
89:02 obligations that we have today there's
89:05 this question which is the following
89:09 can we just allow them to have it and
89:12 then figure out how to go hmm one I
89:19 think that we are you know okay think
89:23 about it this way think about how many
89:25 movies we have today and television
89:27 shows I should actually have said
89:28 television so it shows the set of movies
89:30 where the level of gore and reality and
89:34 even beyond reality beyond gore fake
89:38 gore which is I mean how do you get
89:40 worse than a than a real-life murder
89:42 scene well fake one that's even worse
89:45 and that's so much of the television we
89:48 have today so for someone to tell me we
89:52 can't handle aliens from outer space
89:55 being acknowledged us going to the moon
89:59 you can't get a flat earther to to say
90:05 that the earth being flat is something
90:08 we couldn't handle they're ready are we
90:12 ready to find out Jesus never existed
90:13 yeah I don't know I think the answer is
90:20 it's a non-issue at this point can we
90:24 you know do we have to wait for every
90:26 single person who was alive when it
90:28 occurred to die people who believed it I
90:31 should say to die before we can talk
90:33 about it I don't know
90:37 you know when any of you because I'm one
90:40 of you if you believe it's a hoax how
90:43 excited would you be to wake up tomorrow
90:46 and the headline is NASA admits they
90:52 never went to the moon it's just right
90:55 there are you gonna have a negative
90:58 feedback right when truth goes through
91:01 your soul which is what you're made out
91:03 of right again I always want you to
91:04 remember we don't think of it like this
91:07 but it is absolutely crucial that you
91:10 remember this the universe is pure truth
91:12 and we are part of the universe if it
91:16 weren't truth full okay we would cease
91:19 to exist every once in a while things
91:20 would just erupt the you know
91:22 would rip apart and earth would get
91:24 sucked in and destroyed you know I would
91:27 be morphing constantly because my
91:30 mathematics aren't true they're not
91:32 perfect but they're perfect and that's
91:36 why when you feel the truths say the
91:39 truth think the truth and hang out with
91:42 people who are honest it's a beautiful
91:46 world you know my family I don't talk
91:48 about this much just because it's never
91:51 come up but one side of my family was
91:53 all about keeping up appearances and
91:55 hiding truths you know if somebody if
91:59 somebody I don't know I mean there's
92:01 some of this you don't want to hear and
92:02 some of it you do in terms of when
92:04 you're at dinner or something but the
92:06 other side of my family my surname
92:08 family if someone got an enema that day
92:12 you know because they were sick or
92:14 whatever it could come out at the dinner
92:16 table I know it's totally inappropriate
92:17 and weird but we're just talking about
92:21 life if someone was a jerk or someone
92:24 was this and that you could say it to
92:25 their face and what's your need what you
92:28 have to do on your end of the game is go
92:30 yeah I'm sorry
92:31 so I got to keep it real man right so I
92:35 think of that headline ever hit a
92:37 newspaper slash website or whatever
92:40 there would be this overwhelming joy in
92:44 the world that a big chunk of proof was
92:48 revealed a bunch of truth truth proof
92:51 would be revealed right how many of you
92:54 don't believe Lee Harvey Oswald killed
92:56 Kennedy but you're sick and tired of
92:59 hearing that he did wouldn't you like to
93:01 know who else took those shots you don't
93:04 even really care exactly who they were
93:05 but you know there's 25 guys all over
93:08 the place Jagger Hoover participated
93:11 with LBJ and whatever they have all
93:16 these sci-fi movies that have like the
93:17 grand reset and it's typically some sort
93:22 of cataclysmic event that resets all of
93:24 time I think Blade Runner 2049 talked
93:26 about the reset of history so they
93:28 wouldn't technically have to be in the
93:30 time that they were in 20 49 okay
93:35 what about just a reset of truth how
93:39 amazing when that little movement be and
93:41 that's sort of what the awakening is all
93:43 about but the very first step and we're
93:46 taking prudent steps towards this is to
93:48 get rid of deep state organizations
93:50 their loyal followers get rid of agenda
93:53 21 and get us back to the point we're
93:56 living in normal sovereign inalienable
93:59 right world and then we get to these
94:02 other things like the moon mission
94:03 Kennedy's assassination Franz Ferdinand
94:05 being bumped off kicking off World War
94:07 one you know who made Adolf Hitler I've
94:12 talked about the moon thing a billion
94:14 times I'm surprised that there are so
94:18 many of you that want me to continue
94:19 talking about it because it is a fixed
94:21 moment in time it has a fixed number of
94:24 variables that lend themselves to the
94:27 story and so I I keep analyzing it and
94:31 analyzing it and I will say it's funny
94:34 being in my shoes having this desire to
94:38 do the moon missions I really do I love
94:39 doing them but I also cringe when I
94:43 watch Internet videos from really
94:47 popular well-designed websites the
94:51 amount of repetition that goes on with
94:53 the hosts is starting to get to be a
94:56 little alarming to me they will say the
95:00 same thing four or five times before
95:02 they move on to the next point and they
95:04 don't change the perspective as they
95:07 talk about the same thing right then I
95:09 look at it from the right side look
95:10 everyone website it's so red it's still
95:11 red it's still red mm-hm
95:13 they're saying the same linear
95:16 one-dimensional thing or gets
95:18 two-dimensional thing I don't get it
95:21 it's like there's some virus out there
95:23 in the world some neurological disorder
95:25 that is called repetition when I was a
95:27 kid the only people that repeated
95:29 themselves were old people why do you
95:32 think every time I mentioned something
95:33 that I've already mentioned before I
95:35 want you to know that I know that I've
95:37 already covered that I almost think I've
95:42 debated even saying it but I just feel
95:44 this moral obligation to let you know
95:46 I'm not going
95:47 nuts I just I'm bringing up for new
95:49 audience members because they never
95:51 heard it before
95:52 or whatever but what I am finding out is
95:56 that there always is another perspective
95:58 and this platform technology perspective
96:01 is huge because whatever they're gonna
96:03 do for this next hoax to the moon is
96:06 going to mandate a ton of platforms and
96:09 I think that when we sit there as
96:12 fanboys interviewing Elon Musk at his
96:15 big starship thing we are not asking any
96:18 really detailed question we're asking
96:20 we're asking Elon Musk to make up
96:22 another black box hey man tell us
96:25 something else about something that
96:27 could happen while we're not able to
96:28 confirm any of what you're what you're
96:31 about to say please give us more of that
96:33 and he's just looking at him like okay
96:36 you know he's like he's like Peter
96:38 Sellers and being there you know except
96:40 he's actually really smart but he just
96:42 looks heaven you could see on his face
96:44 you know and his stuttering and his
96:47 weird presentation manner is just so
96:48 bizarre
96:49 I think stuttering as a matter of nerves
96:51 it's a matter of telling lies you know
96:55 Obama every single time he tries to go
96:57 off-script and every time he tries to
96:59 tell a bold lie without his
97:01 teleprompters he starts stuttering he's
97:03 got a really weird stutter problem but
97:05 there's a condition if you look up every
97:08 video of a Barack Obama stuttering
97:12 someone has got him off script and he is
97:15 trying to improvise but he knows he has
97:17 controllers he knows he'll get in
97:19 trouble if he goes too far he's a bit
97:21 because his brains like oh my god what
97:24 am I doing here
97:25 what lies have I told that I can
97:27 remember right away and he gets nervous
97:30 and he basically short-circuits like
97:32 Robby the Robot right but I'm seeing
97:35 young people repeat themselves oh my god
97:38 I'm like I'm just thinking what is it
97:40 diet coke you know I don't know I don't
97:42 know what it is anyway
97:45 as to not repeat myself again I think
97:49 that's all I've got for this particular
97:50 episode I do an apologize I just posted
97:54 seven new podcasts to the website and
97:58 it's just because I'm working on a new
97:59 film
98:00 and working with a team this time and
98:03 it's it's an amazing experience so I am
98:05 not remembering to put those up there so
98:09 anyway I got it all caught up as of this
98:11 recording the last episode I put up was
98:14 agenda 21 so have you ever care about
98:15 kind of where and when this was recorded
98:17 I want to let you know I found three
98:21 episodes that I recorded a long time ago
98:25 and didn't realize that I hadn't pushed
98:27 him out I think I lost faith in them and
98:30 one was on forgiveness one is on I don't
98:33 know exactly what I said it's called old
98:35 America and there was one other one I
98:38 can't remember at the moment because I
98:40 just dragged him all over so I'm gonna
98:42 evaluate those if they're good I'm gonna
98:44 throw him in season five but I might
98:46 look a little younger I'll actually slap
98:49 on the date so when you see those three
98:51 come through the pipe it's just a little
98:54 thing from a time capsule it was 3:00
98:57 a.m. so I better get to bed if you have
98:59 mid to deep thoughts radio Calm please
99:01 go everything he needs up there to video
99:04 YouTube and [ __ ] shoot again [ __ ]
99:06 shoot he's taken off you guys don't have
99:08 the [ __ ] shoot shoot app on your phone
99:10 or you don't go to it you don't have an

99:34 podcast link boom you're hooked up to
99:36 social media Twitter which I don't do
99:39 much with and Facebook which is an
99:42 amazing community it's locked
99:44 make sure when you apply you say
99:45 something human it could be anything I
99:49 would say don't spend a lot of time
99:51 writing too much because I don't think
99:53 we read it that much just let us know
99:55 you're there there's two ways to donate
99:58 with cash and that is PayPal which some
100:02 folks would [ __ ] shoot I think are

100:07 credits I don't know why PayPal keeps
100:09 you completely anonymous but hey I'm
100:12 cool with that
100:12 and then there's patreon
100:14 where you create a little account you
100:15 can put a buck in every month and what
100:20 that will get you is the episodes before
100:22 they release in 85 90 percent of the
100:25 case plus now I'm gonna start putting
100:27 some exclusive stuff up there there's
100:31 two other affiliated things the brave
100:32 browser what you need to get on change
100:34 the search engine from Google to
100:35 DuckDuckGo by the way it finds all my
100:38 episodes where Google does not because
100:41 Google and YouTube work together to
100:43 shadow bin so if you want to have the
100:45 best search results in the planet go
100:47 there and Backblaze which gives you 30
100:53 day retro on your files for five bucks
100:56 and then for seven bucks it does a whole
100:58 year this is something they recently
101:00 changed and I forgot to update you guys
101:01 on that 7 bucks to computers infinite
101:04 drives go get it it's awesome and then
101:07 of course the all remastered season 1
101:10 this channel does not have season 1 it's
101:12 a different channel because I didn't
101:14 want to inter interlace all videos with
101:16 brand new videos because it was a
101:18 hundred new videos you know it would
101:20 have really messed up this channel badly
101:21 but they've all been remastered audio
101:24 levels balanced it's really great and
101:27 bit shoot has them all as well but just
101:29 go to the website there's a search field
101:30 there's a category list you can find the
101:33 videos you want I am now saying if you
101:36 think you're subscribed please make sure
101:37 you are subscribed because everyone's
101:39 getting unsubscribed of course click the
101:41 bell if you want those notifications and
101:43 always remember it's a variety show
101:46 so some videos are gonna like somebody's
101:49 you won't if you come here for moon
101:50 stuff and you've never been here before
101:52 there are so many moon episodes that
101:54 will take you're probably a week to get
101:55 through them if you listen to them in a
101:56 binging format but that's what the
101:59 category list is for on the website
102:02 until next time take care of yourself in
102:04 someone else and I'll see in the next
102:05 deep thoughts over now
