00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:34 deep thoughts I don't really have a
00:37 title yet for this episode so I don't
00:40 want to say a title but this is about
00:43 the incredible responsibility of
00:48 essentially reverse engineering how a
00:52 conspiracy was conducted trying to find
00:57 its motives essentially being your own
01:01 little Sherlock Holmes which is ironic
01:05 is they just played an episode of Star
01:06 Trek next generation where Mariotti
01:09 comes back so why would you listen to
01:12 this here's what you listen to this your
01:15 person who has tried to tell another
01:17 human being about a conspiracy and the
01:21 other person is going through the
01:22 kubler-ross thing like I always say
01:23 they're an anger phase and they're
01:27 trying to deny it
01:31 alright so you talk about the moon
01:33 missions and you hear the phrase I don't
01:36 know how they could keep 10,000 people
01:38 quiet you you hear that lame [ __ ]
01:42 excuse for a bunch of conspiracy sprite
01:44 and I'm gonna conceal some of these
01:47 events that you're gonna know where I'm
01:52 talking about but I want to keep out of
01:53 the censorship mechanism that they've
01:55 got attached all these videos so I'm
01:59 gonna probably not use the C word in the
02:00 title of the episode either because that
02:03 tends to get 2d monetized and it's not
02:06 that I care that one video doesn't get
02:08 monetized it's just that it starts to
02:10 become part of the Deep States penalty
02:13 system towards your channel in general
02:15 but there was a day in the ninth month
02:20 of the year in 2001 so as I make
02:25 reference to that day I'm gonna call it
02:27 that day got an episode called that day
02:29 talks all about that one's a very very
02:33 tough one and probably the biggest one
02:34 we've ever witnessed in human history in
02:37 terms of a
02:39 spear see but now before we get into
02:43 super deep you know acidic things let's
02:48 just look at some very basic principles
02:50 of what I'm talking about here now let's
02:54 say that you go to the Magic Castle in
02:56 Los Angeles so for those people don't
02:58 know what that is it's a member only
03:00 invite-only location where you have to
03:03 dress up in a suit and you have to wear
03:05 a dress and you go in the front door and
03:08 you give your reservation and then you
03:10 have to do some very sort of funny
03:13 things to get inside the actual house
03:16 itself it's just I gantt ik beautiful I
03:19 guess you call it a Victorian house I
03:21 don't know just a traditional old home
03:24 and inside are dozens and dozens of
03:27 magicians having you know they're doing
03:31 a stage show there's a guy downstairs at
03:33 a bar there's a guy with the table in
03:35 the corner there's all kinds of hidden
03:36 rooms in this place and it's better if
03:40 you get invited by one of the magicians
03:42 because they're gonna tell you where the
03:44 doors are where the rooms are and what's
03:47 hot and what's not you have a great
03:50 restaurant in there too and a good bar
03:52 but anyway so you go there I've been
03:56 there number times myself and and you
03:58 see the most amazing things you see you
04:01 know close-up handwork with coins
04:04 close-up hand work with cards so I'm
04:06 usually the person that can do that can
04:08 do both then you'll see full-on stage
04:11 performances interactive stage
04:13 performances or they're working with the
04:16 crowd alright let's just say you're
04:20 watching a magic trick and you can
04:22 substitute anything you can think of but
04:26 once you see someone do something
04:27 amazing right in front of your very face
04:29 and obviously the magician has practiced
04:31 for years and years and years to get
04:33 something right to make it perfect to
04:35 make the illusion complete now let's
04:40 just say that you having perhaps either
04:43 a very astute mind or you've seen the
04:46 trick done for years yourself and you
04:48 keep mulling over it and thinking about
04:50 it and finally it occurs to you as to
04:52 how the trick is done
04:53 and then I sit there and say okay why
04:58 don't you explain to me how the trick is
04:59 done and as much as you might give me a
05:03 short simple answer if I can test your
05:06 answer yeah well that could still be
05:07 this I don't know because of this listen
05:09 is and we go on and on and on and on
05:12 down the line where you have a gigantic
05:14 one-page essay about an event that takes
05:17 maybe a split second to happen there's
05:20 the Criss Angel guy I don't know if he
05:22 still has a show on TV but the scan
05:24 behind his show and god bless him he
05:26 gave us some great entertainment I'm not
05:28 trying to knock the guy whatsoever but
05:30 the scan with that kind of guy is that
05:31 and this happens all around the world
05:33 and I don't think it was invented by him
05:35 I think it was invented in Japan but you
05:38 get a television show where you've
05:41 obviously set up a bunch of amazing
05:43 tricks that are only gonna work it
05:46 nearly every single person who's
05:48 watching the trick on camera is one of
05:52 your people and maybe maybe maybe you
05:55 have one person or two people that are
05:58 kind of organically in the crowd and you
06:01 get them to stand in a really specific
06:02 location such that when they look at you
06:05 and your trick or look up or look
06:07 wherever they're supposed to look they
06:09 only see exactly what you want them to
06:10 see to complete the illusion of course
06:14 all the cameramen are all part of the
06:15 the gig and they know exactly where to
06:17 stand but of course you know it is our
06:21 normal train of thought the cameramen
06:23 are just they're filming you're just
06:24 walking around randomly filming it's not
06:26 the case these guys are told to sit on a
06:28 particular mark get it right he'll
06:30 they'll probably take five or six takes
06:32 if everyone's in on it yeah you know it
06:35 just is just as a disclaimer okay this
06:38 is all entertainment that they do and we
06:39 love entertainment so again there's no
06:41 criticism here but now that event occurs
06:46 it's being filmed by the person there's
06:49 being filmed by someone on the team with
06:50 the person and so you watch what the
06:54 film says but you're watching TV it's
06:59 over you have suspicions on how it was
07:01 done and I tell you to explain yourself
07:04 but you've only got the footage that
07:06 their team filmed of this particular
07:08 event now the event may last five
07:12 minutes but your explanation might last
07:15 days because you're having to imply into
07:19 deuce and conclude and connect things to
07:22 go well you see that thing over there
07:23 that thing you know if that was that way
07:25 and this is he she moved that girl was
07:27 over there and now she's over here which
07:28 means tiny past and they trying to make
07:29 it look like a continuous shot whatever
07:31 it is you're going through all this
07:33 minutia to explain why you don't think
07:38 it was real no again I'm cheating with
07:42 magicians because magicians obviously
07:44 are not I mean I don't want to spoil
07:48 anyone's feelings here but they're not
07:50 actually magicians in terms of truly
07:53 creating magic they're amazing
07:56 illusionists is what they are and they
07:59 should be celebrated for being that
08:00 because it's phenomenal what they do
08:03 love good magician so let's take the
08:06 average event that is sponsored by the
08:11 people who pretend to be the victims of
08:14 the event usually a government body
08:19 what's fascinating is the event that
08:23 occurred 18 years ago from 2019 the big
08:26 one we in that timeframe didn't have the
08:32 phrase fake news the project Mockingbird
08:37 where the intelligence agencies brought
08:41 in a bunch of folks to learn how to
08:45 disseminate propaganda to the world and
08:48 then they seated them in all the
08:50 important positions of news you know
08:54 playing off the egos of these people
08:57 don't you only be famous don't you want
09:00 to have a lot of money well as long as
09:01 you do what we say we will make sure
09:02 you're an untouchable you're gonna be
09:04 rich you're gonna be famous for decades
09:07 and decades and decades you will
09:10 literally die one of our folks happy as
09:14 a clam and so they trade their
09:19 to do this they're just like Faust like
09:22 I just said in a previous episode but 18
09:25 years ago when this event occurred every
09:27 piece of information now with some
09:30 exceptions here every piece of
09:32 information they got broadcast on
09:34 network news was orchestrated by the
09:39 people who set it up for all the other
09:44 piece of news and I mean imagine you had
09:46 a your own camera again this is before
09:50 we had the social media empires before
09:53 we had YouTube before we had a place
09:56 just to upload things that make things
09:57 seen so they did it at the most perfect
10:01 time because they were still in control
10:03 of everything they hit the airwaves now
10:04 let's say you took a video of something
10:07 a little off you were standing in the
10:08 right place you may have filmed
10:10 something where what they said occurred
10:14 didn't occur in your camera lens well
10:16 now what are your options you could put
10:19 it online if you could find a place to
10:20 do it and although back in those days it
10:22 was rough man it was rough to put stuff
10:24 up there so you call a network and you
10:26 say I've got the most miraculous thing
10:28 the footage that you have that has
10:31 perhaps an aircraft in the shot before
10:36 this other explosion occurs I don't have
10:39 the aircraft I've got the explosion all
10:40 by itself and the news network goes
10:44 thank you very much because whoever's
10:46 answering the phone that morning is all
10:48 part of the game as well we will
10:49 definitely buy that from you only if we
10:51 get exclusivity oh yeah sure sure and
10:54 they give them whatever amount of money
10:55 20 grand 50 grand hundred grand but they
10:59 also get the person don't they because
11:02 they got the call you know they got the
11:04 footage they got the person they can do
11:07 what the person whatever they want wipe
11:09 them off the map
11:10 don't say anything take the footage
11:12 never air it of course cuz that's the
11:15 point we're gonna harvest all this stuff
11:18 but now there was so much footage during
11:21 that day that the average person
11:23 including me back in the day we thought
11:26 what more could you possibly want to see
11:28 its cover from so many different angles
11:31 and you know at that point of my life I
11:34 knew of a few conspiracies in the world
11:37 but definitely nothing going you know to
11:40 to outdo like Pearl Harbor right that
11:44 thing was 18 years ago was that early
11:48 phenomenal but I was thinking about this
11:51 here the day which drove me to this
11:53 conversation and I was having the
11:55 conversation with the friend of mine
11:56 because you get into this angst of
11:59 saying Jesus their complexity once it
12:05 reaches a certain threshold which that
12:08 day eighteen years ago was probably the
12:12 most landmark complex FF we've ever seen
12:17 in history it probably is one of the
12:21 most intense conspiracies in history and
12:26 maybe call this reversing reverse
12:29 engineering truth something like that
12:30 that way it stays out of the realm but
12:32 that thinking out loud there so if you
12:36 had the official story in a cyclopædia
12:39 let's just say some sort of volume book
12:42 you would have each building that was
12:46 involved having its own book the the
12:51 press how the press were manipulated how
12:53 they got that footage out to folks
12:54 depending on whether or not there was a
12:56 aircraft or not aircraft that's a whole
12:59 separate thing I mean obviously there's
13:00 aircraft but whether or not they
13:01 actually used it to knock down anything
13:04 or hit buildings or anything like that
13:06 we don't know the Pentagon would have
13:09 its own book Shanksville but have its
13:13 own book and then all the backstory of
13:17 these people that were supposed to be
13:19 involved you know like again within a
13:21 couple months 10 of the 19 guys were
13:24 identified as being still alive they
13:27 simply said oh well though their
13:29 passports were stolen no one today has
13:32 ever said in front of me that 10 out of
13:35 the 19 are alive
13:38 no one's ever repeated that back to me
13:40 but that's fact
13:41 and then there's the follow-up stages to
13:44 it the Patriot Act the military
13:47 commissions Act mandatory eavesdropping
13:50 you got the the shoestring bomber guy
13:54 right
13:54 the TSA homeland security formation all
13:59 these pre-planned neocon things were set
14:03 in motion then you have the war starting
14:06 in 2003 you have us attacking a country
14:09 that's not even remotely accused of
14:11 being involved you have the co bo guy
14:19 right
14:21 the OBL guy and is the accusation
14:23 towards him then you have all the CG
14:26 work that was used to portray him you
14:28 have the body double who's right-handed
14:31 wearing a ton of jewelry face doesn't
14:33 match that guy you have the history of
14:36 all the people involved for 30 years
14:39 beforehand who was an asset of who you
14:42 have the organization's and how they
14:44 used to be a database and now they're
14:45 the name of the organization right this
14:48 gets insane it gets incredibly complex
14:54 now
14:55 that's us writing a probably a 10 to 20
15:01 book volume set each book is going to be
15:04 World Encyclopedia and dimension good 8
15:08 by 11 or whatever it's probably gonna be
15:12 a couple hundred pages of pop by each
15:14 one of those subjects how it was planned
15:16 let's just think that's the official
15:18 story of how they did it the the
15:21 conspiracy now was reported but how they
15:23 actually wired buildings and did what
15:25 they did
15:26 alright if you are to deduce what they
15:30 did I'm going to tell you that your book
15:33 volumes set will be exponentially larger
15:35 than their book set because you don't
15:38 have so if you were to write your book
15:41 volume set on how they did it without
15:44 actually having their book set to tell
15:46 you how they did it yours is going to be
15:48 exponentially bigger than theirs because
15:52 you don't have a video camera inside
15:53 shrouding your's box
15:56 is the kind of life is it not life we
15:59 don't know look up Schrodinger's cat if
16:01 you need to find out what I'm talking
16:03 about so now think about this what if
16:07 you didn't want to get caught but you're
16:08 gonna do this kind of thing anyway well
16:12 what do they know about the human mind
16:14 the more intelligent the society gets
16:16 and the more short attention span
16:19 society gets you know bye-bye 18 years
16:22 ago attention spans were low we had
16:27 medicine that we give kids and we give
16:29 ourselves to stay healthy which is
16:32 making us unhealthy injures our mind
16:35 television it's just bam bam bam bam bam
16:38 movies are just ding ding ding ding ding
16:40 so we have a short attention span
16:42 well now what if you were lucky and
16:45 someone gave you from that side their
16:48 book volume said let's just say it's 20
16:49 books ok well even if it was a book a
16:54 single book that tried to explain it all
16:57 it's the the official true story of how
16:59 they did it you're gonna have deer eyes
17:02 on the other side of the room probably
17:04 within 15 30 minutes unless you got a
17:07 truther who's got the stomach for all of
17:10 it but it would be difficult for you to
17:13 read and memorize all of the things that
17:15 they did in the stages that they did the
17:17 people that participated how many years
17:20 they plan to do this thing which we have
17:22 evidence that goes back at least to the
17:24 early 1990s 1991 neocon papers the the
17:33 simulations at the Pentagon for an
17:35 attack of that exact kind with the plane
17:38 coincidentally the guy in the photo
17:40 ended up flying supposedly flight 77
17:42 hahahahaha
17:45 ok I just think about the there's got to
17:49 be a little book at the end which is
17:50 everybody who was murdered who was on
17:53 the know in the know and their
17:56 backstories right give about a page per
17:59 person as to why they were determined to
18:01 be of threat to the people that did this
18:05 and how they were murdered when they
18:07 were murdered who did it
18:09 see that book would be pretty amazing
18:11 right horrific ly amazing so the problem
18:15 is is that the official stories a lot of
18:17 times of how they actually did it not
18:19 the official story that's reported to us
18:20 I'm kind of mixing words here I
18:22 apologize but the actual truth about how
18:26 they did it is so utterly complex that
18:29 your average citizen will not have the
18:31 attention span to pay attention to it
18:33 will not be able to remember the facts
18:34 and you're going to be hurting their
18:39 feelings on a level that's crazy and so
18:43 the problem is is that they're not going
18:45 to be able to listen to the actual truth
18:47 even if they got the book on it your
18:50 average person large portion of the
18:53 world doesn't even care because it
18:54 wasn't their country that got hit they
18:56 don't care
18:57 all they want to know is the basic fact
18:58 was it real or was it fake I mean it was
19:01 fake but it was still real you know but
19:04 the story was it true or false
19:06 that's all they want to know does they
19:08 don't care they don't be vested interest
19:10 they're not losing their freedoms as a
19:11 result of this event now if you have to
19:15 reverse engineer the truth looking at
19:18 all the little tiny scientific facts of
19:21 physics of of aviation of how planes
19:25 work and how missiles work and how all
19:27 this stuff happens you will have a story
19:32 that is so long in so complex and it's
19:36 going to only partially be accurate
19:38 because you're doing your best but you
19:39 don't know when a building falls due to
19:43 fire a steel-reinforced building
19:45 obviously there's a lie going on well
19:49 how did they do it well they could have
19:50 done in a million ways they could skin a
19:53 cat a million ways on that particular
19:55 day in all the areas of what they did
19:58 now some things we do know because you
20:01 have to do it one particular way but
20:03 that doesn't get you all the facts but
20:07 one of the books we haven't talked about
20:09 in their book said the truth book said
20:10 is why did they do it why did they do it
20:15 who thinks that they should have done it
20:18 like someone's got to make a decision to
20:19 do something well who's that person
20:22 and what did they think in their mind
20:25 where did it initiate from that's a
20:28 tough one because that's one of the
20:31 questions we get with the moon missions
20:33 well why would they think yeah I mean
20:35 why would they I was like well you're
20:37 asking that question like they can
20:38 actually get there first of all second
20:40 of all money maybe you know nine and a
20:45 half billion dollars spent by 1972 on
20:47 the moon missions 72 money to put that
20:51 in perspective when Elvis Presley died
20:54 1977 the rumor was that he had a million
20:56 dollars in his bank account a Corvette
21:00 special edition Indy 500 two-tone black
21:05 silver I think costs ninety five hundred
21:08 bucks back in the day you just take it
21:10 home if you had that kind of money and
21:12 Elvis's got a million dollars in the
21:14 bank and we're talking about them
21:16 spending and laundering nine point five
21:18 billion
21:19 okay it's a ton of cash people it is a
21:22 ton of cash of course money is the
21:27 easiest way to get a piece of [ __ ] to
21:29 sell out a human being that doesn't see
21:33 any violation in anything there's
21:36 fighting humanity they're stealing from
21:38 humanity they've heard all these weird
21:42 stories about I don't worry about it we
21:43 print money there's tons of money laughs
21:45 we're not taking money out of anybody's
21:47 mouth da da da da da
21:50 so this is our conundrum this is our
21:55 sort of enigma our paradox our Pandora's
22:01 box if we are to wake up we have to
22:07 figure out a way to take infinite
22:09 complexity and somehow describe it in a
22:12 nutshell such that it communicates the
22:17 profound truth that someone needs to
22:21 hear if anyone loses their life during
22:26 one of these FF events if you don't know
22:30 what that means just ask in the comments
22:32 and I'm sure any one of the truthers
22:33 will let you know what that acronym will
22:35 stand for
22:36 we gotta stay out of the keyword system
22:38 if anybody dies then we have a serious
22:42 situation on our hands in my opinion as
22:44 it relates to our car heater now of
22:49 course it's easy for folks in the
22:53 secular world to minimize a creator and
22:58 that accountability to the universe
23:00 because they see the fact that those
23:03 that run the world have no belief in
23:05 that whatsoever
23:06 they can't they couldn't possibly have a
23:10 belief in a creator no one in the
23:12 Windsor family can't believe in a god no
23:14 matter how many times they go to church
23:16 do whatever they do there's no way any
23:20 of monarchy on planet earth could
23:22 believe in a god same with a banker they
23:25 have to be devoid of any and I mean
23:28 we're not talking about maybe believing
23:31 in God not believing in God we are
23:33 talking about a flatline void of a true
23:37 vacuum of belief they can't have a
23:40 morsel of curiosity otherwise it would
23:43 develop over time and eat their soul
23:46 when's the last time you saw a banker
23:48 come clean with the world and just do a
23:51 press conference live streaming on every
23:54 single live streaming surface service in
23:56 the world never right never ever ever
24:01 imagine a billionaire which isn't even
24:03 remotely the most wealthy type of person
24:05 in the world a billionaire banker
24:08 suddenly starts having dreams or starts
24:10 having visions of what it's going to be
24:12 like to meet their creator to be the
24:14 rest of the life forces in the universe
24:16 as a matter of fact and they they start
24:20 realizing they may have been on the
24:22 wrong side their whole life but they're
24:24 worth a billion dollars and let's say at
24:26 least they've got 50 million in cash
24:28 they could liquidate at any moment pull
24:30 out of a bank account do something
24:32 imagine throwing a 50 million dollar
24:35 press ofin you can hire militias who
24:40 believe in the truth to be your security
24:42 guards you can hire whatever you want to
24:45 make sure you're okay
24:46 build a little bulletproof box to talk
24:48 in
24:50 and you go up and you say everything
24:54 this person says everything that they
24:56 need to say it's never remotely happened
24:59 in this world which means no one has a
25:01 conscience on this side of the game now
25:05 the only lunacy that they could possibly
25:10 have on that side is to somehow perceive
25:13 themselves as God's chosen people now of
25:18 course that logic breaks down because
25:20 you don't like if you're the teacher of
25:23 children let's just say because that's
25:24 how they would view it
25:25 they are the elder we are the children
25:29 what would you do if you suddenly the
25:32 world changed for you and you became a
25:34 teacher of children K through five fifth
25:38 grade is it your job to spank them and
25:42 beat them and starve them and make them
25:45 sad and make them commit suicide to put
25:50 them in other fights with other schools
25:53 in different districts so you can keep
25:55 them busy this is what we call war know
26:00 you would have to say I have been given
26:03 the most coveted permission by somebody
26:07 to teach children and therefore I must
26:11 treat them with the utmost care now of
26:14 course there's a little jerky kid in the
26:16 room and yeah you're gonna have to do
26:18 something with the disobedient but we
26:20 have plenty of obedient people in this
26:23 world who are suffering every single day
26:25 because of their actions because of the
26:27 way they've crafted the world because
26:29 they won't allow technology to heal us
26:31 the only blood technology out to hurt us
26:35 they poison us from the second that were
26:38 born and they are the people we have to
26:40 go to to be buried but now when you deal
26:45 with people that are trying to do the
26:47 denial thing and it's really sad because
26:50 the the anger thing is pretty easy to
26:53 get over if someone's getting angry when
26:55 you start telling them something you
26:57 know my advice is don't pick anybody's
26:59 gonna get angry because that just
27:01 doesn't work
27:03 because they killed a messenger right
27:05 but I find that when you get into a
27:08 conspiratorial conversation I just
27:10 didn't never so-called sharing
27:11 conspiracies but we're talking about the
27:15 data mining that it takes to build the
27:17 game to have the conversation but you
27:20 know it's denial and negotiation prior
27:23 to ever reaching a level of acceptance
27:26 okay the denial and negotiation starts
27:31 going hand-in-hand really quickly I
27:33 remember the first time I showed one of
27:35 my family members the squibs coming out
27:41 of the buildings on that day the
27:44 evidence that there was something inside
27:47 the building that was detonating and
27:49 pushing a ton of air out and now we have
27:52 amazing footage of not only that squib
27:54 pushing out but in one case a body comes
27:57 flying out of the hole and it comes
27:59 flying out at a level that I mean was
28:02 going like 40 miles an hour 50 miles an
28:05 hour it was gut-wrenching as a real live
28:10 human being see some people think it
28:13 wasn't wasn't real but whatever that's a
28:15 lot of that's a lot of work great a
28:17 little stunt okay this person looked at
28:20 the footage and said oh well they could
28:24 have done that with CG does the person
28:27 knows nothing a posse gee nothing but
28:32 the person was also staring at official
28:34 news footage and so I said to her I said
28:38 are you serious this is footage from the
28:40 news network that you think has all the
28:42 integrity in the world shutdown
28:47 robot overloads and shuts off and hopes
28:52 to god that when they turn back on the
28:53 conversation is not going to continue it
28:58 hit a level of fear that was inside that
29:02 is the natural intellectual barrier
29:04 which I've discussed several times that
29:07 pushes back on this information don't
29:09 shatter my world and all I could think
29:12 of is they must be at there
29:15 dream ability to accept what they
29:19 already are trying to envision what they
29:23 already are trying what they're willing
29:24 to accept excuse me they already at the
29:26 level of what they're willing to accept
29:27 and they can't accept any more and then
29:29 I'm walking in the room going oh you're
29:31 on level two let me show you a level 11
29:33 boom here's the footage must be CG I
29:38 feel so smart saying CG I'm gonna back
29:42 up I've said a couple times Tim just did
29:44 a great dissertation on our Facebook
29:47 site apparently there was a moment of
29:51 questioning his expertise in the area of
29:54 visual effects and let me just bow for
29:58 Tim a thousand percent he and I've had
30:01 some conversations on the back-channel
30:03 this dude knows his stuff alright and we
30:06 have we have and I got my buddy Kyle who
30:09 as this point I think we're gonna
30:11 interview each other or an interview
30:13 we're gonna have a show in about a week
30:15 from now so that's should be pretty cool
30:18 but I got tons of tons of these dudes
30:20 around me all the time but Tim is one of
30:24 them if Tim lived in this area he would
30:27 be on this patio probably but one of the
30:30 one of the things I want to make sure
30:31 you guys understand so you don't sound
30:33 like an idiot when you're talking out
30:34 there the novice of the world says CGI
30:37 the people in the professional industry
30:40 of never I mean they said that maybe in
30:42 the early 90s but but it went CG its CG
30:45 it's always say just so you know so if
30:47 you want to sound a little more
30:48 intelligent with that conversation
30:50 especially if you're debating another
30:52 person being an expert and you're going
30:53 you don't know anything about CGI you're
30:57 removing all doubt you know nothing
30:58 about what you're talking about don't be
31:00 that person
31:00 it's computer graphics that's all we
31:02 need scripts on the internet were called
31:06 CGI a long time ago it's one of the
31:07 first books that our Riley ever
31:09 published on the subject look at the
31:12 Kennedy situation the JFK situation now
31:16 people have asked me to do an entire
31:17 episode on his death I suppose I could
31:23 probably pull that off I have covered it
31:25 so many times on so many episodes
31:28 that I feel like it would be a giant
31:31 repeat but perhaps you're valuing just
31:34 having it out there as its own thing I
31:36 have a book that's called the elite
31:38 serial killers it is phenomenal I just
31:43 referred it to a friend of mine tonight
31:44 but he goes through Lincoln JFK RFK and
31:47 MLK and it is it is the it isn't it
31:52 isn't complete on exactly you took the
31:55 kill shot for JFK a lot of that
31:57 informations recently even re-released
31:59 and re-verify with better information
32:02 but now when I think about all the
32:05 conversations I've had about JFK and
32:07 they are very fearful because the
32:11 declassified material about JFK during
32:13 this last during this current minused
32:15 administration admits that shots were
32:19 taken from the railroad tracks and head
32:23 ahead of the car that immediately
32:25 shatters the official story but of
32:27 course no press covered it not even your
32:30 big truth Fox News right for those of
32:32 you think that they're telling the truth
32:34 right there's a couple guys on that
32:36 network that I think are ready to become
32:40 true through the second they find a way
32:42 to pay their bills and do what they do
32:43 for a living without being on the
32:45 network currently they can't escape they
32:48 have contracts and so they're doing
32:50 their best inside of a silly
32:52 organization but think about it Oliver
32:56 Stone's movie all the books you've ever
32:58 read all the conspiracy videos you've
33:00 ever seen all these ridiculous
33:02 assertions that have been pushed into
33:04 the public as disinformation against the
33:07 official report trying to accuse
33:09 Jacqueline Kennedy of shooting JFK I
33:11 mean I hate to disappoint anybody and I
33:14 hate to insult anybody but if you think
33:16 she popped her husband because he banged
33:20 Marilyn Monroe and or someone else you
33:23 are insane you are [ __ ] insane right
33:27 that means you know nothing about
33:28 humanity or empathy or how someone feels
33:31 about something the same phil Hartman's
33:33 wife who was a nutcase and blew him away
33:35 in bed right this is a hey I'm gonna do
33:38 my first murder and I'm gonna do it in
33:40 public
33:41 and I'm gonna have all this help to get
33:44 away with it I'm gonna pop him in that
33:46 you know the he got shot over his right
33:48 eye over here right we saw the shot
33:50 happen she did not reach around with a
33:53 gun and put it on his forehead and pop
33:55 him all right so that whole thing is
33:58 just to fall for that you need to go
34:02 back and check everything that you
34:03 believe because you've probably
34:04 swallowed a ton of disinformation now
34:08 the one thing that I think appears
34:10 credible and it's because of two things
34:13 that occurred is when that car slowed
34:15 down and stopped approximately as the
34:18 witnesses have said I wasn't there I
34:19 don't know but they said their car
34:22 stopped for 11 seconds it came to a
34:25 complete stop and that that was removed
34:30 from the footage so it looks like the
34:32 car kind of slowed down and then sped
34:34 back up again but there's a stop in
34:35 there when he got shot it was someone
34:41 you know stopping it to lining it up but
34:43 the driver of the car appears to do
34:45 something very strange now by himself
34:49 this other thing that but the driver
34:51 doesn't completely become conclusive but
34:54 this is me going into writing the book
34:55 about the books right there's a set of
34:57 books that's the truth probably in some
35:00 piece for a Rothschild and ones your
35:02 family library somewhere in a basement
35:04 probably the basement of vatican right
35:06 now week you know everybody but our
35:09 books are all over the place because we
35:11 have a million different theories but it
35:13 does look like the driver he slows down
35:17 the car and the passenger Secret Service
35:19 guy grabs the steering wheel that is
35:21 your catalyst for the drivers story
35:22 having any validity or high probability
35:25 as being potentially true the guy
35:28 reaches into his coat pocket pulls out
35:32 what looks like a gun and he's looking
35:35 at Kennedy he's got his whole head he's
35:37 the driver of the car why wasn't it the
35:40 guy next to him because that guy's got
35:42 his back to the governor and then it's
35:44 another seat back before you get to
35:46 Kennedy at least on our world but he
35:48 brings out a big shiny thing and he
35:51 looks like he's about to take the shot
35:52 but the other shot happened first
35:55 right over the right eye pop and then
35:58 the driver goes got him grabs the
36:00 steering wall and takes off again yeah I
36:03 celebrate everyone's curiosity and
36:07 asking me a question about a ridiculous
36:09 theory it is perfectly fine we have to
36:11 do that to get our stuff together but to
36:14 take a you know Jacqueline was not a
36:18 [ __ ] okay but to get her to a point
36:21 where she is going to commit murder the
36:24 woman had obviously never killed anybody
36:25 in her life I don't know how much time
36:29 she spent firing pistols to get herself
36:31 all warmed up for this event but if she
36:34 was going to shoot him then she's not
36:36 going to try to get away with it she's
36:39 just gonna go boom he cheated on me
36:41 screw that guy that's how that's gonna
36:43 go if she were to somehow come up to be
36:45 you know Bonnie from Bonnie and Clyde
36:48 they say her trying to climb out of the
36:50 car was proof that she shot JFK amen
36:54 she's the one in charge if she had a gun
36:57 she was in charge who else had a gun
37:00 right Secret Service would have pounced
37:02 her body in two seconds what are you
37:05 doing you crazy broad boom but she
37:08 wasn't crazy she was a wife she's
37:10 watching a horrific situation I don't
37:13 know how many of you have seen your
37:15 spouse get their head blown off at
37:17 point-blank range right I mean you're
37:19 looking at this point blank you're less
37:21 than 14 inches from the head there's now
37:24 exploding the smell of the inside his
37:27 skull is up her nose all right this is
37:30 horrific [ __ ] and to somehow pin it on
37:33 her JFK Jr's mother what do you think
37:36 they're really trying to do here they're
37:37 trying to send a message if JFK jr. is
37:39 really alive who knows the videos or not
37:41 they're trying to say we're gonna defame
37:44 your mother you better show yourself or
37:47 whatever right there's a reason why
37:50 George Herbert Walker Bush again used
37:53 general air sorry President Ford's
37:55 funeral to stop talking about President
38:00 Ford's death and he starts talking about
38:02 how they shouldn't entertain outrageous
38:04 conspiracy theories about
38:08 quis death what you're at a funeral for
38:12 a former president and you're usurping
38:14 the the ceremony to talk about the death
38:21 of JFK what are you crazy so let's talk
38:25 about how we deal with this problem
38:29 someone is requesting from you your
38:34 basically your documented book volumes
38:36 on who did it why they did it and
38:39 exactly how they did it
38:41 and I assure you if you leave one little
38:44 straw out of place one little thing out
38:47 of place you don't have an answer for
38:48 absolutely everything some people are
38:51 going to walk away from the conversation
38:53 the truth of the situation is is that if
38:58 you're going to be talking to someone
39:00 who's that and hit picky about the
39:02 information you're never gonna win that
39:04 conversation anyway you're just not but
39:08 there are going to be people that are
39:10 really truly gonna have their butt on
39:11 the fence and they're like okay I've
39:13 heard this not only from you but from
39:14 other people so I got some time lay it
39:17 on me
39:19 here's the problem I mean here's the
39:22 challenge I should say if you don't have
39:24 your game tight on whatever you're gonna
39:26 be talking about then you are going to
39:30 lose credibility with this person if you
39:33 don't have at least some form of
39:35 strategy to talk about the gray areas if
39:38 you don't preface your explanation with
39:42 well we know some things we don't know
39:46 some other things we can only guess
39:48 about these things but we're pretty
39:50 certain about these things well however
39:52 it lies with whatever you're talking
39:54 about right that will help them
39:57 drastically give you a little bit of
40:00 leeway when you're discussing these
40:01 things now I'm gonna give you a sort of
40:06 a facetious example about what we should
40:09 probably be doing before we get into
40:11 these conversations but we know that we
40:15 none of us really do this now some
40:17 people do some people create websites
40:19 and bless them because this is their
40:22 the people we go and look at we look at
40:24 their information we look away they
40:25 break things down we try to see if
40:27 they're making sense but very few of us
40:30 will sit down and write everything down
40:33 we don't write it down on a piece of
40:35 paper what do we believe okay well what
40:39 are the different pieces and parts what
40:40 actually took place on the on the day
40:43 that 18 years ago that this thing
40:46 happened this big one if you were to
40:50 simply write down the official story
40:53 which needs to be disputed if you
40:54 believe different then you're you're
40:57 going to have a very large basic
41:00 document especially if you write it by
41:01 hand you're gonna have a sore wrist when
41:03 you're done just the basics of what took
41:05 place what was claimed you know what
41:08 took place and how they claimed it that
41:10 thing took you know how that then
41:12 occurred now one of the listeners
41:15 recently asked me to cover the plane
41:19 that supposedly nose dived into the
41:23 ground and left this really tiny crease
41:26 in this field and there's no way to
41:31 cover that for an hour there just isn't
41:33 there's not enough information there
41:35 what I know about that particular sorry
41:38 what I have deduced and what I have seen
41:42 about that event is that a couple things
41:46 came out fairly quickly and some things
41:49 took a long time to come out the thing
41:53 that came out very fairly quickly is
41:54 that the coroner that was supposed to
41:56 have but given the biological matter
41:59 from the people that were supposedly in
42:01 that hole right we've never in the
42:04 history of mankind has any aircraft ran
42:09 into the ground ran into a mountainside
42:11 and HAP's had absolutely no debris of
42:14 any recognizable kind that has never
42:16 occurred but we've had plenty of
42:19 vehicles from the air run into the
42:22 ground run into an ocean run into a
42:25 mountainside the mountainside ones are
42:27 probably the most important ones for you
42:30 to view because you're talking about
42:32 flying at full speed into these
42:35 structions the coroner said he never
42:38 ever saw any of the results was never
42:42 given any materials and then he suddenly
42:45 disappears and I can't remember whether
42:49 or not they said he died but no one can
42:51 get a hold of this guy he's out of the
42:53 picture it's basically shut up or we'll
42:56 kill you
42:57 the other thing that I heard over a
43:00 decade later probably 15 years later is
43:03 the gentleman that owned the land where
43:06 the sliver of dirt was there there's two
43:10 stories about how that got there first
43:12 story I heard was that a missile was
43:14 shot into the ground to create that and
43:16 that was going to be blamed on you know
43:19 the event that's where this plane went
43:21 and blah blah blah
43:22 again no chairs no engines no tail
43:24 sections no wings no nothing it's a big
43:27 object okay and never in the history of
43:30 mankind again is one of these things
43:31 been able to vanish for any reason
43:34 whatsoever you could fly it into a
43:36 thirty foot thick cement wall and the
43:38 thing's not going to be peaceless right
43:42 it's going to have stuff compressed and
43:44 everywhere right
43:45 anyway but they wonder recently you know
43:50 and I can't I can't make a phone call
43:53 and confirm this is the problem right
43:55 but they said that the farmer eventually
43:57 came out and said that he had dug that
43:58 hole two years earlier for a completely
44:01 arbitrary reason I forgot exactly what
44:03 he was trying to do now I've seen a
44:06 whole press conference with there's
44:08 there's a one gentleman that pursued
44:10 that flight quite a bit and he said that
44:14 the plane actually went down eight miles
44:17 away or or something like that and the
44:19 debris field was gigantic and that it
44:22 was kept out of the press 100% no one
44:24 was allowed to get close to it before
44:26 they cleaned it all up don't know don't
44:30 know wasn't there didn't see that
44:32 another person said that it had landed
44:35 in I think Cleveland and it was reported
44:38 on the news by Reuters as having landed
44:42 okay maybe drop everyone off maybe don't
44:47 was on the thing
44:48 we know that operation Northwood which
44:52 was a FF planned by a particular
44:56 individual that reported to JFK that
44:58 they were going to try and fake a plane
45:01 going down and then blame it on Fidel
45:04 Castro and it was going to have college
45:07 students in it
45:08 not really but it was going to be faked
45:10 as having college students on it to
45:13 catalyze the event such that Americans
45:16 would support a full-blown invasion of
45:18 Cuba so let me pull back just first
45:25 would second because we're going into
45:26 details I'm trying to give you examples
45:28 about how intensely ludicrous this can
45:31 get when you try to reverse engineer the
45:33 truth right friend of mine told me today
45:37 a very interesting thing that she was
45:40 told by a very professional director
45:45 because she had considered making at one
45:48 point in her life she wanted to make
45:49 some sort of documentary that would
45:52 advance an agenda that and an increase
45:56 awareness for something that she cared
45:57 about it could be one of many things in
45:59 her life and this director told her you
46:05 know what she can't really accomplish
46:07 that because the second you tried to
46:09 create a documentary with this big cause
46:12 you invariably simply create a piece of
46:16 propaganda and I think that's utterly
46:19 brilliant because it's completely true
46:22 now the challenge when you create a
46:25 documentary about something you're
46:27 passionate about is the burden of truth
46:32 on your assertion we know a movie that
46:35 was made in the tail end of 2006 that
46:37 said the world would be completely over
46:40 by now underwater we have crazy people
46:44 in office who are repeating this crap
46:48 now and they've come up with you know
46:50 Bay dos is now saying ten years the
46:52 whole world to be gone this is what this
46:54 guy is doing he campaigned in Los
46:55 Angeles a friend of mine went she had no
46:57 idea she was being lured to the event
46:59 and she said you know this guy actually
47:01 told the whole crowd of the
47:02 world's gonna be over in ten years if
47:05 humanity wanted to destroy the earth in
47:08 ten years the best bet we could do is
47:11 unleash all the nuclear weapons all in
47:14 one day and then we would wipe out
47:17 ourselves out wipe out all the life on
47:19 Earth but aside from doing that driving
47:22 a car raising livestock that farts
47:25 helping repair of the bottom of the
47:28 ocean that China is completely
47:29 destroying with their nets their fish
47:31 nets right making sure fish live which
47:34 makes them procreate more indicate more
47:36 which results in more carbon in the air
47:39 supposedly co2 it would be very tough to
47:44 get all the facts together because
47:46 what's the problem with the world right
47:48 now where do we get our facts like I
47:51 said in my other episode what are facts
47:54 the number one official arteries for
47:58 facts in this world have now it's gonna
48:02 be coming up on a 200 year anniversary
48:04 as of 2055 at least have all been
48:08 laundered into yellow journalism lies to
48:14 sway the opinion of mankind right into
48:17 their hands here's our homework I
48:22 guarantee you something is true they
48:26 have now seen the power of the Internet
48:29 and they have seen the ability to create
48:32 a Great Awakening they have seen
48:34 scenarios where they lose big time and
48:38 so they are advancing their agendas as
48:41 quickly as possible and that is why we
48:43 have absolute certifiably insane people
48:48 like Cortes saying certifiably insane
48:52 things to the world you know no planes
48:57 no boats I mean you know the the
48:59 congresswoman from Hawaii
49:00 how hilarious how's she gonna get over
49:02 to her her homeland a rowboat and she's
49:06 for this new green deal thing right
49:07 obviously hilarious but they have done
49:10 for sure simulations on how fast did
49:14 they think they can shut this thing down
49:16 with laws with censorship with shadow
49:20 banning all that good stuff and other
49:23 techniques right
49:24 again you post anything in Britain I
49:26 mean this is what's just unbelievable
49:30 like I you know I have just a couple
49:35 friends in Britain the best kind of
49:37 friends I like to hear from are you guys
49:39 from Britain I mean you guys are there
49:41 oh jeez for me your truthers but the
49:45 level of docile nature that you can post
49:47 something on the Internet in the UK and
49:49 cops will show up to your house and you
49:52 haven't in America you wouldn't have you
49:55 wouldn't have made a needle burp at all
49:58 over here
49:59 yeah whatever everyone over in America
50:01 is speaking their minds because they got
50:03 this freedom of speech thing we hate but
50:06 we have activists over there what is it
50:08 the is it Robinson guy so Geoffrey
50:11 something like that that guy got thrown
50:13 in jail was finally released look at
50:16 Julian Assange he's sitting in prison
50:19 but a normal citizen can just post their
50:23 concerns and say they dislike what the
50:26 EU is doing to their country and they're
50:28 gonna have a cop intimidate them at the
50:30 door there's one dude that just recently
50:32 filmed that he held his phone to his
50:33 right side he had two police officers he
50:36 says well my breaking the law no then
50:38 what are you doing here well we just
50:39 think you know bla bla bla at that point
50:41 the conversation is moot did I break the
50:43 law that I don't need to talk to you are
50:44 you investigating some crime that I can
50:46 help you with can I provide more
50:47 information well sure but we're not
50:49 talking about a crime let me commit the
50:52 crime first and then come after me
50:53 because that's sort of the way the world
50:55 works you're innocent until proven
50:57 guilty
50:58 well in Britain it's turning around its
51:02 Minority Report they're predicting sort
51:06 of with the assertion that you're a
51:09 loose cannon you're going to cause a
51:10 problem which is insane because with the
51:14 surveillance state in the UK if you
51:17 bought a gun what you can't do if you
51:20 started behaving weirdly in acquiring
51:22 materials and traveling to pockets over
51:25 there talking to other militant groups
51:27 or whatever they're gonna know in two
51:28 seconds one second half a sec
51:30 which is obviously not happening for
51:32 these people they're simply expressing
51:34 themselves and the police officers I
51:36 mean these are special kind of people
51:39 these are people that don't believe in
51:42 freedom this is like the Clockwork
51:44 Orange Clockwork Orange I don't mention
51:47 it much on this show but it is an
51:49 extremely important book and movie for
51:55 those of you haven't seen it we're gonna
51:56 go through a little bit of its arc
51:57 because this is what's happening in the
51:59 UK in my opinion the talk work whines
52:02 I forgot the gentleman wrote the book
52:04 but Stanley Kubrick made the movie it is
52:08 a book about a gang
52:11 I hate they're called the droogies they
52:15 have their own language in the book
52:16 which is very interesting you can
52:18 understand because it's made out of
52:19 English but they do drop in I think it's
52:21 Russian words here and there but it's a
52:25 gang of I think it's one two three he
52:30 was like five guys run by a guy named
52:32 Alex and Alex is the lead he's played by
52:35 Malcolm McDowell in the movie who does
52:37 just an amazing job everyone does an
52:39 amazing job in this movie but they go
52:41 out at night for a little ultraviolence
52:44 and they're probably guys all in their
52:47 mid-20s and they are in fact the fact
52:51 that this is one of malcolm mcdowell
52:52 first roles on film jeez okay I was
52:55 dialed in but they rape and they kill
52:59 and they do all these crazy things and
53:02 then eventually Alex pushes his guys too
53:07 hard and they betray him and he goes to
53:11 jail so he's in jail and he opts for
53:16 this technique to get out of jail
53:18 quicker which is to subject himself to
53:21 this therapy which they wire his eyes
53:24 open they put him in a straitjacket they
53:25 put him in a movie theater and they play
53:27 videos to him and music to him by giving
53:30 and giving him this drug that makes him
53:32 sick all the time doing basically an
53:34 association between violence and nudity
53:37 and all the basic components that he was
53:39 attracted to as a gangster and so that
53:42 when he seized it off the drug
53:44 he gets sick and he's unable to make
53:48 love to a woman he's unable to harm a
53:51 soul because he gets deathly ill I mean
53:53 like he gets full death paralysis
53:55 feeling and I believe this was actually
53:57 a real thing that they tried in the real
53:59 world so he gets out of prison goes home
54:05 finds out that his parents have rented
54:07 his room and they really don't want to
54:08 have anything to do with him because you
54:10 know he betrayed the family he betrayed
54:13 everything that they believed in so now
54:17 he's wandering the streets and he gets
54:21 some just desserts
54:23 people that he had hurt in the past as a
54:26 young man find him and hurt him back you
54:30 know one of these events he's being
54:32 attacked by a bunch of homeless guys a
54:34 bunch of what they would call bums back
54:36 in those days hobos and he can't fight
54:40 back he's just being beat up and you
54:41 know in a way he deserved every bit of
54:43 it
54:44 but the police come by and pull him up
54:48 all these guys off of him and he's so
54:51 thankful that these cops you know helped
54:53 him out until he looks up and he
54:56 realizes that the cops are his old
54:57 buddies from his gang and they take him
55:02 out in the woods and attempt to kill him
55:05 yeah they don't quite take him out
55:07 because he's got to have more of the
55:08 story and I'll leave it there there's a
55:11 much more interesting scene that comes
55:14 after that but I'll leave it right there
55:15 because that's the point of our purpose
55:17 here
55:18 but for these police officers to go
55:21 against the very fabric of humanity's
55:24 freedom I mean what would would be the
55:27 purpose of a police officer in the first
55:28 place to serve and protect not to a just
55:32 public opinion not to ensure that the EU
55:35 takes over Britain not to make sure that
55:37 brexit never gets voted on not to make
55:40 sure that people are unaware of the
55:43 sanctuary cities that are all over that
55:46 place and that these people are raping
55:49 and killing people left and right the
55:51 bringing in these arcane you know
55:54 thousand-year-old traditions of how to
55:57 into women and children that's not their
56:01 job their job is I should go out and
56:03 stop crimes but they're not doing that
56:07 the hard part they don't do that they
56:11 look the other way when the raping and
56:13 murdering is happening from these new
56:14 immigrants that have moved in that are
56:16 claiming religious freedoms and that
56:18 uses don't report on that they're
56:22 looking the other way so they don't do
56:23 their job they run around doing the
56:25 tyrannical job the dystopian job the
56:28 fascist job the old monarchy jobs I have
56:34 a buddy here in Southern California that
56:35 is a psychologist and at one point in
56:41 his life he was working for the prison
56:43 system here in Orange County he no
56:44 longer does this but about three years
56:47 ago when I first had a conversation with
56:50 him I smoked lounge
56:52 I was just asking him what he does and
56:55 sort of how it goes and he's just super
56:57 brilliant guy and he started quoting to
57:00 me Ike use your intelligence quotient
57:03 quotient right and he said that because
57:08 he was talking about prisoners in
57:10 general and he said you know 85 and
57:11 below IQs are usually super docile
57:13 people that don't have any anger in them
57:16 they can't manifest harming anyone else
57:20 they're usually mentally disabled to the
57:23 point where there's sort of doing
57:24 whatever they were told if you ever see
57:26 making of a murderer on Netflix the
57:29 nephew who manufactured the story about
57:32 his uncle is measured at below 85 IQ and
57:36 so when they suggested to him everything
57:38 to say back during his confession and
57:40 you know he thought if he just repeated
57:42 what they said he'd be able to go home
57:43 and sleep in his bed instead he repeated
57:46 what they said all construct of the cops
57:48 and he ends up going to jail that night
57:50 he hasn't been free since I believe he's
57:53 I don't use out yet I think he's been
57:55 under he's been up for parole several
57:56 times but they don't want that kid out
57:57 because he could talk because he'd be
57:59 free to talk so keep in jail and he
58:01 can't talk all right
58:04 then he goes ten points more between 85
58:09 and 95
58:10 you get your mentally disabled folks who
58:14 are violent and they are violent because
58:17 the world doesn't make any sense to them
58:19 they've got enough IQ to know generally
58:23 where they would like to be in life but
58:25 not enough IQ to figure out how to ever
58:26 get there they're very susceptible to
58:29 drugs because they're trying to stop the
58:31 pain of not being able to give her they
58:33 who want to be it's very powerful when
58:37 you think about it again
58:40 we have erased trade skills we erased
58:42 education so we are now pumping 95 and
58:46 below out in six packs you know but so
58:51 he tells me that and I'm it's
58:52 fascinating I'm like wow this guy is you
58:54 know he's coming from a point of a
58:55 complete Authority and dealing with
58:57 these individuals but the third thing he
59:00 told me about IQ was shocking
59:02 and he brought up an article I think he
59:06 brought up two or three to be honest but
59:07 it all I needed to see was one but it
59:09 was an official article about how they
59:12 hire police officers at least in the
59:14 state of California and they said that
59:17 the maximum IQ that you're allowed to
59:19 have as a police officer and this isn't
59:23 obviously the truth for all police
59:25 officers right but if you test super
59:28 high in your academic tests you can't
59:30 believe it police officer they'll find
59:32 another reason to deny your access to
59:34 that job and he said that 110 IQ is the
59:39 highest you can have but they like it to
59:40 be lower and the reason why is that the
59:44 police officers then start if you get
59:46 over 110 you start to have
59:47 self-awareness and EQ or AI your
59:51 emotional intelligence and you start to
59:54 question what you're doing and so those
59:58 cops that show up at the door in Britain
59:59 trying to enforce some you know
60:02 globalist censorship of the mind to try
60:06 and literally stifle and prevent freedom
60:09 from ever growing in your mind to
60:11 threaten you like some gestapo that's
60:16 what it is they have a low IQ or perhaps
60:20 they have a super IQ and they are more
60:23 devious
60:24 you know again if you do something wrong
60:26 to someone else but it's out of sheer
60:28 ignorance well at least you can kind of
60:31 fall back on the fact that you didn't
60:32 know any better you didn't perceive that
60:35 as being a threat whatever happened as a
60:37 matter of cause and effect was not in
60:38 your model but if you know what you're
60:41 doing you're a Kissinger right you're a
60:43 Zig new Brzezinski kind of guy you are
60:45 engineering demise as a weapon as a tool
60:49 to keep your employers on top and your
60:52 employer subjects the rest of humanity
60:54 on bottom now for me because I will tell
61:01 you that you're kind of damned if you do
61:03 and you damned if you don't when it
61:04 comes to the theme of this show we're
61:07 talking about trying to educate others
61:10 on what has gone on in this world where
61:12 it matters all right well my memory
61:18 isn't perfect but it's pretty
61:20 substantial and if I'm sitting with
61:22 someone with a cell phone with a nice
61:24 full charge on it and someone wants to
61:26 know about something because everything
61:29 is connected as far back as recorded
61:31 history the deception models from the
61:34 primary religion on this planet for
61:36 first world countries to some of this
61:40 more crazy [ __ ] in the third world
61:42 countries it's all evil it's all there
61:45 to manipulate you it's all to keep you
61:46 off balance I will slowly take wherever
61:50 they entered the scene like if they want
61:52 to talk about Vince from 2010 or
61:54 something you know I don't know anything
61:55 up in 2010 specifically but we start
61:58 stemming away and I start doing the
61:59 connection show you know there just be
62:01 that show in the UK called connections
62:02 brilliant guy would take a firecracker
62:06 in China and then link it to the Saturn
62:09 5 you know which I love that show
62:12 the lawyer exists but I'll start doing
62:16 that and I'll just keep talking and keep
62:18 talking and I keep bringing up the
62:19 articles that bring up the imagery and I
62:22 show them and I'm looking at them and
62:25 I'm trying to register whether or not
62:26 they're getting tired if they want to
62:28 stop and ask me more questions I stop
62:30 and we go into that deeper and we'll
62:32 change the story they're more interested
62:34 in you know branch a or branch B we just
62:36 change
62:37 usually coming back to tie it all
62:39 together but even your most curious
62:42 adult has limits I had an amazing
62:46 conversation with a dude I met last
62:48 night to smoke lounge we most have
62:50 talked for like seven hours straight we
62:52 left the place at 5:00 a.m. thank God I
62:55 have a key and I don't know if it was
63:00 because we retired but it was right at
63:02 the beginning of the conversation I he
63:06 may end up watching this so this would
63:08 be kind of funny but I started talking
63:10 about the moon missions and I was giving
63:13 him the first-hand account that I had of
63:16 the two guys that told me in 1991 that
63:19 this was a forgery and that they were
63:21 directly involved one of the guys again
63:23 prodigy Kidd tons of patents within NASA
63:26 the guy was legit okay but I got to the
63:31 sweet spot in the story I'm in it maybe
63:34 120 seconds and he changes the subject
63:38 like it doesn't even matter and it's
63:42 like it would be like me telling you
63:45 guys on some live chat that I just had
63:47 an experience with aliens and I'm
63:50 getting right to the point very quickly
63:53 I'm starting to get to the point where
63:55 I'm gonna have a conversation with his
63:57 alien and he's gonna tell me why he's
63:59 here and the whole purpose of aliens and
64:02 you guys don't have any interest in and
64:04 all sudden you want to change the
64:06 subject well I want to talk about
64:07 Hillary Clinton you know right be
64:09 something like that and so what happens
64:13 and for the best now we end up talking
64:15 about other things but happens to the
64:16 best of us what's interesting is is that
64:21 and sort of sort of I think unfortunate
64:26 for my own existence is that the only
64:28 place that I get that kind of
64:29 conversation back is that maybe a couple
64:34 dudes at my smoke lounge got owns a
64:36 place is so informed it's insane
64:40 but it's usually YouTube videos and the
64:43 bummer of YouTube videos for the most
64:45 part unless is somebody I know who's
64:48 making a video which is almost nobody I
64:50 mean there'd be almost nobody or someone
64:54 that I can trust someone has been
64:55 validated through someone else which is
64:57 almost nobody you're watching YouTube
65:00 crap it's YouTube and even though it
65:03 seems really good right information good
65:05 integrity unless somehow the description
65:08 of the videos got a bunch of links out
65:10 so we can see what's going on it's tough
65:11 and that's how I'm being viewed as well
65:13 and I don't blame anyone for being
65:15 skeptical if I'm talking about our
65:17 outrageous things which is like when I
65:19 get into moon evidence videos I try to
65:22 bring as much overlaying clips so for
65:25 any of you coming through podcasts and
65:27 you've never seen the YouTube video it
65:30 is in your best interest if you're
65:32 interested in the moon hoax to go watch
65:33 the moon videos there's a yum there's a
65:38 playlist called space programs just go
65:40 look at that playlist and get your moon
65:42 stuff but you want to watch them so you
65:44 can see the physical evidence I'm
65:45 showing you in the video so you can kind
65:47 of get at least something else you can
65:49 pass on this somewhere else someone else
65:50 without my voice being attached to it
65:53 now one of the things that's pretty
65:55 interesting for me is that I have people
65:58 that are people that I'm introduced to
66:01 through whatever means and they are in
66:05 my opinion very certified brilliant
66:07 people and they also have the highest
66:11 level of integrity that you're ever
66:13 going to find on this planet and so we
66:15 get introduced to each other could be at
66:16 a party could be online and so it
66:20 there's a bit of like the the butt
66:22 smelling dog introduction right and you
66:24 know like you know - you do you tell
66:27 lies like what motivates you in life
66:29 what have you done with your life and
66:31 then what I've seen any shows of course
66:33 maybe like one or two shows that's not
66:36 enough and so through conversating with
66:39 each other we're able to find out that
66:42 we both are for you know ultimate
66:44 integrity of course no two people
66:46 believe the same thing and for me what's
66:48 really rich is to have one of these
66:51 people that I make friends with and
66:54 we we both have a propensity to question
67:03 everyone it's almost like you have to
67:05 earn trust beforehand which is sort of a
67:09 sad apatow of how the world works today
67:11 right we want to be able to trust
67:12 everyone we first meet and it's certain
67:15 scenarios in certain locations in the
67:16 world like if I go to my hometown and I
67:19 meet a new person I'm probably gonna
67:22 lean on the model of I'll better trust
67:24 you first until you do something weird
67:27 maybe I keep my sensors up a little bit
67:29 more with that person you know just
67:31 lightly questioning things but that
67:34 almost never happens in my hometown
67:36 because I trust people again little tiny
67:39 town you can't make a living lying to
67:42 people you will eventually move out of
67:44 that town because no one will talk to
67:46 you and no one will help you it's no fun
67:48 which almost never happens because you
67:50 just know how to behave the sad thing
67:53 about the theme of this episode is that
67:55 it is almost a an imperative and
67:59 obligatory responsibility that we have
68:01 to the rest of the world unless somebody
68:05 confesses about the things that they
68:08 were involved in and through
68:09 compartmentalization individuals that
68:11 participate in these events that we
68:13 don't like they don't have this the full
68:16 story either
68:16 you know if the moon missions were faked
68:19 as we believed on this show then who
68:23 knows all the information who's still
68:26 alive I guarantee you one group of
68:29 people that do not know all the evidence
68:31 would be the astronauts themselves they
68:33 don't have all the truth they know what
68:35 they did but it's on a need-to-know
68:37 basis that's all that was a coin phrase
68:39 I think if you're like me you are hoping
68:44 and praying that I would say similar to
68:48 the fall of the USSR when the citizens
68:51 of that country raided the KGB and they
68:54 went through all the rolodexes of
68:55 everyone who was abducted put in prison
68:59 murdered investigated he's dropped on
69:03 all their rights violated they were able
69:05 to find out a tremendous
69:07 some information what an amazing thing a
69:10 non digitized form of tracking human
69:13 beings was right there for them the
69:15 taking
69:16 today we know it's all digital and so if
69:20 there was ever a catastrophe for them
69:22 the five eyes they just pushed the red
69:25 button and it all gets erased all of
69:28 their evil is just gone and so too with
69:33 it the truth
69:35 and we have not I don't think we have
69:39 faced a paradox of that level since
69:42 perhaps maybe the burning of the
69:44 Alexander Alexander library right now
69:48 when I hear that reference I want you to
69:50 know that I believe that all the
69:51 information was confiscated the building
69:53 was burned down and that information is
69:56 definitely being held somewhere because
69:57 I don't think that the ruling class of
70:00 any time period or geographical location
70:03 is that stupid to get rid of stuff that
70:05 could benefit them in the end they just
70:07 want to get rid of it it was amazing
70:11 when I played the first Assassin's Creed
70:12 there's a phase in the first Assassin's
70:14 Creed where you are playing this
70:18 character right and you are watching
70:20 this book burning exercise I don't know
70:23 if it was supposed to be the library but
70:25 it was almost identical they were
70:26 burning all the books in this this
70:29 beautiful library of knowledge and it's
70:32 you're feeling the insanity of it if
70:34 you're aware of what you're doing I
70:37 remember playing it and turning my
70:39 girlfriend going I can't believe this
70:40 game was made I can't believe anyone let
70:42 this narrative out because it really
70:44 does accentuate the fragility of
70:47 information and just to kind of put a
70:51 fine point on that before we in the
70:52 episode you know I've done several
70:56 episodes where I'm trying to reconstruct
70:58 history and you know I'm just
70:59 regurgitating the aggregate of what I've
71:02 seen in documentaries and really great
71:06 videos that people have made articles
71:08 people have written maybe a handful of
71:10 information I got from firsthand people
71:14 but what I have to concede and I don't
71:17 want to concede
71:19 is that history just maybe lost with a
71:27 with an impossibility of ever
71:29 discovering it I was diving back into
71:32 some Egyptology recently because I was
71:36 trying to figure out where the Pharaohs
71:40 of the world lived because it's one
71:42 thing I overlooked that you're telling
71:45 trying to tell us pyramids are tombs
71:46 which are not tombs we got the value of
71:48 the Kings that proves that we have
71:49 master buz we have temples where the
71:52 hell did these people live and there's a
71:55 lot of great evidence about where they
71:56 lived and exactly how these places were
71:57 put together but unless the place is
72:00 preserved like Pompeii you know where
72:04 it's preserved in ashes and we can
72:05 simply remove the ash and figure out
72:08 where bodies were to figure out where
72:09 people probably lived and you know
72:11 certain rooms of certain sizes so they
72:14 could do certain things if you found
72:15 livestock in a particular room well that
72:17 must be where they lived you know unless
72:20 we can find something like that all we
72:22 can do is guess but the problem is is
72:25 that for the academia of the world they
72:29 have to say they didn't they don't have
72:32 any suspicions that this is the way it
72:34 was they have to have the outrageous
72:37 discovery that this is the way it was
72:38 that's how they get their funding some
72:41 only someone recently posted on our
72:43 Facebook page
72:44 I believe this documentary about was it
72:49 I want to see Admiral but I don't think
72:54 he was he was Colonel Byrd the dude who
72:56 went to the South Pole to do some
72:59 research and he brought this whole gang
73:01 of people down there and he was selling
73:04 his book writes his movie rights he was
73:07 promising articles and all the stuff so
73:11 he could go down there and do it and
73:12 they brought a gigantic amount of stuff
73:14 they said it took three months to unload
73:17 the boat that they brought down there
73:18 mean 3 months man things are a little
73:21 slower down there because it's really
73:22 cold but that's a lot of stuff and so he
73:25 did one expedition and then went back
73:28 and then he came back I believe a second
73:31 time
73:31 and he was supposed to take a really
73:34 long journey to this advanced base camp
73:37 which was way out there on the ice and
73:40 the the weather had made the place
73:43 almost impossible to to traverse they
73:46 tried to go one time and they were they
73:48 were kept back by a 60-foot crevasse or
73:51 as Tenacious D says crevasse and so they
73:55 had to turn back and then he went and
73:57 they dropped him off with a plane or
73:59 something ha somehow he got there but it
74:01 was only gonna be him out there and he
74:04 stayed out there for quite a long time
74:06 until I think he went a little beserk
74:09 and he was getting toxified the stories
74:12 he got toxified by his diesel generator
74:15 that was creating all of his heat and
74:17 electricity and the way they tell the
74:19 story is that he was reporting back that
74:22 he wasn't feeling well on his Morse code
74:25 got to the point where it was it was
74:27 nonsense they couldn't make out what was
74:28 going on so I knew he was in trouble and
74:30 then the first camp where everybody was
74:33 they kind of voted and like half the
74:35 people were like screw that guy he
74:37 didn't want to take anyone else with him
74:39 let him just write it out but luckily
74:42 enough people said you know what I think
74:45 he might be in peril might be dead by
74:47 the time we find him boy you don't want
74:49 that on your conscience right we got to
74:51 go back home and sell our story because
74:52 is how we get funding and so they
74:55 wouldn't rescued him and sure enough he
74:57 was really am a CEO didn't screwed up he
75:00 was kind of going insane by breathing
75:01 all these fumes but they came back and
75:05 the way that they this documentary I
75:07 believe communicated it was that they
75:09 covered it all up they needed to make it
75:12 a success story and that should tell you
75:15 it's a standard archetype of how things
75:17 work the guy that discovered the king of
75:21 - Tutankhamun right King Tut
75:25 they what I was told the story as a kid
75:29 they said that he started digging in a
75:32 particular area and he didn't well this
75:34 is whether this is where they tell you
75:36 the story I'm gonna tell you what I
75:37 think he was right next to the pyramid I
75:40 mean I'm sorry white next to his tomb
75:41 but he dug the opposite direction in a
75:44 big circle
75:45 and he ran out of funding while he was
75:47 doing this and so as soon as he got the
75:50 news that he was literally out of
75:52 funding he walked straight to the tomb
75:55 scratched the surface and found the door
75:59 now what I think really happened was the
76:01 guy knew exactly where the tomb was
76:04 maybe even discovered it by digging and
76:06 went okay we got a bunch of money here
76:09 if we don't spend it then you know we
76:14 may not get another allocation they may
76:16 they may expect us to just find
76:18 everything in two seconds let's go the
76:19 other direction anytime we need to we're
76:21 gonna go back to the tomb so he tried to
76:24 find some other tombs maybe while he was
76:26 Dean didn't find any but he tried and he
76:29 went back when he needed to open that
76:31 baby up and the world changed right are
76:34 their opinion our opinion about how
76:36 everything worked upgraded considerably
76:38 right
76:39 we know that the Egyptologist the head
76:42 Egyptologist who works for the Cairo
76:44 Museum
76:45 that guy's staging all these days all
76:48 his fake stuff luckily is off the air
76:51 now because I think they realized look
76:52 no one's fallen for this stuff maybe
76:55 your local indigenous people fall for
76:56 this stuff but definitely not the modern
76:58 first world people and I don't think
76:59 either groups falling for it quite
77:01 frankly I give them the benefit of the
77:02 doubt that they know that his stuff is
77:04 fake you know haven't you ever seen a
77:06 movie where there's like an Indiana
77:08 Jones type movie and they'll say that
77:10 you know the government come up to like
77:12 a tomb of some sort right some some
77:14 sarcophagi in and they got a fake that
77:17 the lid is really heavy right and they
77:18 got a fake that this place has been
77:20 locked down for ten thousand years or
77:22 whatever the story is trying to tell you
77:23 even a thousand years but they start
77:26 lifting the lid off and of course the
77:27 dust is like falling off this lid in two
77:29 seconds and then you can tell right away
77:31 the lid probably weighs two pounds and
77:33 they're trying to act like it weighs you
77:34 know a ton and of course these humans
77:37 have no problem lifting a ton off of
77:39 this sack off a guy but then they you
77:41 know they throw the lid down and there's
77:43 something in this tomb and you just know
77:46 well that's a prop of course the thing
77:49 would be so sealed shut just by sitting
77:51 there for ten thousand years you
77:53 wouldn't be able to get it out get it to
77:54 open with probably a crowbar you might
77:56 even just you know yank the crowbar and
77:58 lid breaks right and if you're a true
78:01 archeologist and I supposed to break
78:02 anything supposed to take your time but
78:05 it's a movie but that's the quality of
78:08 the events that this dude put together
78:09 from the Cairo Museum
78:11 so as we try to reconstruct truth try to
78:15 reconstruct history because all of this
78:17 is now history every bit of its history
78:18 if there's a horrible event that occurs
78:22 in January of 2019 and then it's 2020
78:27 before you start to look into it well
78:28 its history every day that goes by is a
78:32 day that information is hidden raced
78:34 there's teams that go in for
78:36 post-mortems that clean everything up
78:37 anybody who saw too much is erased if we
78:42 find evidence well if they find evidence
78:45 I mean oh this is happening right now
78:48 with the moon missions you know they
78:50 want to let they they do not want to be
78:52 spending money on hiding the hoax of the
78:54 moon mission they don't but they have
78:57 teams on it I guarantee you probably
79:00 their deepest thinkers to go guys your
79:03 job is to look at the entire Apollo
79:05 mission probably even the Gemini stuff
79:08 find the holes find the weaknesses make
79:11 us a list and we're gonna have a meeting
79:12 later on you get maybe a month two to
79:14 three months maybe six months maybe a
79:16 year you come up with everything and I
79:18 mean we want to list everything that is
79:20 a weakness in this story and that we
79:24 want you before we meet to come up with
79:26 the solutions how are we going to
79:28 explain away that rote memory can't do
79:30 this how we're gonna explain away that
79:31 battery packs were not strong enough to
79:34 keep this place warm their suits their
79:37 limb capsules how we can talk about all
79:39 is the Van Allen belts come up with you
79:42 know something that's utterly convincing
79:43 it's bulletproof and the poor saps to
79:48 get into these groups well their problem
79:50 is they can't for a lot of these things
79:52 there's no way to explain it what's
79:54 funny is your average computer geek
79:56 let's take a 15 year old computer geek
79:58 today I mean a real geek kid who knows
80:01 everything god bless him you're never
80:04 gonna be able to convince one of these
80:05 kids that rote memory was sufficient
80:09 sir power was sufficient you won't these
80:13 guys that have reported in with 30 years
80:15 air conditioning and heating backgrounds
80:18 you're never gonna be able to convince
80:19 them that you can take care of a
80:21 spacesuit with a guy with 280 degrees
80:23 plus on one side of the suit and
80:25 negative to ideon it it's never gonna
80:27 work and so they're gonna have to have
80:30 hot spots in the report to go this one
80:33 is never going away and you can't kill
80:35 every guy in the world and every girl in
80:37 the world that knows that this is BS so
80:40 we're just gonna have to do a blackout
80:42 that ever gets reported that's we get
80:45 shadow banned that's what gets pulled
80:46 out of the conversation never ever
80:49 invite any of these guys to a town hall
80:51 meeting on live television to talk it
80:54 through because we're gonna eat our
80:55 lunch and think about it how does a jury
80:59 work in a court of law at least in
81:01 America well reasonable doubt right
81:04 reasonable doubt and you have to acquit
81:07 whoever is being accused of whatever
81:09 they're being accused of and because of
81:11 double jeopardy and our Constitution
81:13 when you get off like oj you'll never be
81:16 prosecuted again for that crime you
81:18 might have a different crime but
81:20 definitely not that one
81:21 Crow's oj was stupid enough to go commit
81:24 a bunch of new crimes unreal know that
81:28 when one of these events happened this
81:29 will be my final phrase when one of
81:31 these events occurs time is of the
81:33 essence and a bunch of people who make
81:34 conspiracy videos online know this but
81:37 if you're gonna be sort of the amateur
81:41 gumshoe detective like most of us are
81:44 when an event occurs in the present day
81:46 that you think is BS and you've got the
81:49 you got the time on your hands and the
81:51 and the interest in the event to certify
81:54 it's one way or the other you've got
81:57 maybe 48 to 72 hours to get all the
82:00 information that's going to be erased
82:02 you know get all you know you need to
82:05 have TiVo or some sort of DVR hooked up
82:09 to record everything and then you have
82:10 to have the smarts to disconnect that
82:12 thing from the internet find a way to
82:14 download it to your computer put it off
82:16 on a drive somewhere where they can't
82:18 get to it and continue and continue and
82:20 continue so you got all the information
82:22 don't even try to analyze
82:23 until you got it all and then go back in
82:26 a firewalled
82:27 environment no internet connections
82:29 anything and look through it all
82:31 because they'll find a way to race it
82:33 off your computer you know what was it I
82:36 heard a report that when Jesse Ventura
82:40 had his sort of fake conspiracy show
82:44 there was one he reported where it was
82:47 removed off everyone's DVR I don't know
82:49 if that's true I only caught a couple
82:51 episodes of that but I met one of his
82:53 producers on his show and that guy quit
82:56 because he was like this was all fake
82:59 this was all BS so for those of you
83:02 think he's a big honorable guy just know
83:04 that his show was a complete set up
83:06 because the integrity of the guy talking
83:08 to me wasn't that high and he had his he
83:11 had his card punched the point he
83:13 couldn't handle it anymore pretty
83:14 interesting I hope you feel me on this
83:18 one you know
83:19 obviously your thoughts are critical I
83:21 mean and this is kind of video that's
83:23 like really important you know for not
83:26 my information I'm setting you guys up
83:29 you know setting up the volleyball you
83:31 got to spike it so your information is
83:34 critical if you have them into deep
83:36 thoughts radio calm please go that's
83:38 where you can switch between audio and
83:39 video there's a lock facebook group a
83:42 Twitter page a patreon page and a PayPal
83:45 account plus there's the link to the new
83:48 season one of deep thoughts so it's a
83:51 brand new channel where it's all been
83:52 remastered so if you're new to the
83:54 channel and you want to ingest the first
83:56 100 episodes they do exist on this
83:58 channel that you're watching this video
84:00 from but know that if you're on YouTube
84:03 the first hundred videos on YouTube have
84:06 been heavily gaint so you want to go
84:08 over to the other channel where I've
84:10 cleaned up all the copyright issues for
84:12 the music I put in the beginning of the
84:14 show's another good thing I'm I'm so
84:18 proud to announce is that my skepticism
84:21 a bit shoot is completely resolved they
84:24 are it works completely perfect now so
84:26 I'm uploading all the new season ones up
84:28 to [ __ ] shoot right now so eventually
84:33 once I get through the hundred
84:34 remastered episodes I think I'm
84:36 47 tonight and I got another 53 of these
84:40 things once I get all that taken care of
84:42 then I can just push the whole library
84:43 from 200 up to wherever it ends up on
84:47 the [ __ ] shoot but we're trying to get
84:49 some viewership there now bright t on
84:51 the update with that site is that they
84:53 are coming up with a new version next
84:55 month June of 2019 right now their
84:58 upload doesn't work I've got one mutual
85:01 friend with the guy that invented bright
85:04 T on so I have definitely been assured
85:07 that it's a real website it's really
85:09 going for the freedom of speech thing
85:12 hopefully he his architecture works long
85:16 term still not hearing anything from
85:18 kim.com he says he's going to come up
85:20 with his own social media platform he
85:22 stopped talking about it unfortunately
85:24 if anybody could do it he could do it so
85:28 it's looking up it's cool until then
85:31 take care of yourself and someone else
85:33 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
85:35 over now
