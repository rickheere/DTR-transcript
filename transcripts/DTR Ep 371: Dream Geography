00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts I'm contemplating what to
00:38 do today I still have like four episodes
00:41 in the queue at all times I want to
00:45 cover dreams I want to call this episode
00:49 the geography of your dreams or
00:52 geography of dreams geography the study
00:59 of locations not to be confused with
01:04 geologists right I don't think too many
01:06 of us get to take soil samples in our
01:08 dreams here's what I've come to notice I
01:13 will have dreams in a particular
01:17 location meaning the place where I start
01:22 my dream and this the buildings and the
01:24 streets or no when I say buildings the
01:29 buildings are actually big they're big
01:33 giant places that you that we sort of
01:37 live inside of but then then we go
01:39 outside too
01:39 it's not like we're stuck in some giant
01:41 skyscraper permanently these locations
01:48 will seem to last about a week to two
01:50 weeks and it's almost as if for myself
01:55 they tend to run dry of experiences of
02:00 people and before I go to bed after a
02:04 week or two at that particular location
02:07 I will say to God let's have a change of
02:14 venue let's change it or any you know
02:17 any spirits that are listening to me who
02:19 may contribute to such a thing now a
02:22 psychiatrist or psychologist might laugh
02:24 and say oh you're just talking to your
02:25 it'd and you're the one making the
02:28 change
02:31 fascinating is as I was younger you know
02:35 after I got through the nightmare phase
02:37 that I've discussed several times the
02:39 night your face was just me and my
02:40 bedroom constantly his bedroom bedroom
02:41 bedroom bedroom all kinds of weird [ __ ]
02:44 happening and what was funny is even in
02:46 the Nightmare era of my childhood other
02:50 than a couple times where the room was
02:53 just as dark as it was when I went to
02:55 bed my brain just copied and pasted it
02:57 into my dream my toys were always sort
03:00 of coming after me on the ground and
03:02 again they never touched me they just
03:05 were coming to met coming at me if I
03:06 look over the bed I have this one vision
03:08 of looking over the bed and it's
03:10 probably prior yeah definitely prior to
03:13 Close Encounters of Third Kind for sure
03:15 because that was 78 and I was having
03:18 these dreams at about 73 74 I think he
03:24 met me a couple times I never had that
03:26 one again and then the reoccurring
03:28 nightmare that I had from I don't know
03:32 God knows when to about seven my room
03:35 looked really cool that's the weird
03:36 thing it's just this crazy manic and
03:38 broad creating a impossible scenario for
03:43 me to escape from without hurting your
03:44 feelings or whatever but I really want
03:48 to focus on now because I think in the
03:52 past my dreams had been fairly scattered
03:54 I didn't have reoccurring places at
04:00 least in a row now there are places that
04:04 I I'll give you an address this will be
04:09 fun for any of you want to just pull up
04:10 a web browser go to Google Maps search
04:15 on 601 North grant Chanute Kansas CH a
04:19 nu te Kansas 667 to 0 that was my
04:23 uncle's old house my house was two
04:26 blocks Eric sorry two houses down at six
04:28 one seven North Korean that's where I
04:29 used to live and they're just little
04:33 Kansas homes right but the three-story
04:37 thing or it's only two-story I should
04:39 say but it has this weird kind of attic
04:41 at the top of it and all those houses
04:43 have basements
04:45 is this just how they were built but my
04:49 brain at one point at the sixth 601
04:52 North grant location which I think a
04:54 buddy might owns that now we would at
04:59 one point in my dream I went up there
05:00 this is like 20 30 years ago got up
05:03 there and there was a secret fourth
05:06 floor
05:08 that was actually the floor that had the
05:10 slanted ceilings due to the rooftop and
05:12 that actually exists in a much it's a
05:15 big attic I mean you consider an walkie
05:17 I think you can walk fully upright in
05:18 that attic for most of its most of its
05:24 foot to floor space and I think that it
05:28 was probably meant to be built out and
05:30 just no one did it but some fashion
05:32 attic just like you see in Hollywood my
05:35 hometown is a great place if Hollywood
05:37 just never discovered it the amount of
05:38 movies they could shoot there would just
05:41 be off the chain for every type of
05:43 looking Craney type story they want to
05:45 tell you know I wrote my first film to
05:48 be set there so every like every 5 to 10
05:54 years I would go back to that location
05:56 at 601 North Grand I'd be in that fourth
05:59 storey and it was um it was beautiful it
06:03 was sort of like a teleportation from a
06:07 nice manor house from would be like a
06:12 really quaint little study for like a
06:15 British manor house or something some
06:18 little Downton Abbey attact
06:20 attic with little you know the rolodex
06:24 topdesk's with all these little nooks
06:26 and crannies like you know stop watches
06:28 and [ __ ] right there is a dream I had
06:33 where just sort of cover a couple
06:37 reoccurring places there was a big place
06:40 that kind of looked like um it kind of
06:42 like an airport outside where you have
06:44 normally you'd have hangars but these
06:47 were like department stores sort of
06:50 things I never there's like three or
06:52 four of them I only go on the very first
06:53 one the first one you go inside and it's
06:56 this unbelievable are
06:58 Decco looking smooth interior it's kind
07:04 of a bluish interior had these gigantic
07:06 escalators that took you up and they
07:09 were like bizarrely extra wide like a
07:11 double-wide escalator taking me up and I
07:14 dreamed this was a little kid and then
07:16 you had to kind of get up you go way up
07:18 probably geez 2530 feet and then you
07:23 kind of have to take another little
07:24 escalator up to the next side but it was
07:25 a movie theater and it seemed like the
07:30 escalators kept getting tighter and
07:31 tighter and tighter the more you went up
07:33 that smaller they got and you were sort
07:34 of going into this bizarre location a
07:37 bit like when Willy Wonka lets them into
07:39 the big factory room and so the movie
07:45 theater up top sort of loses a bit of
07:47 its Art Deco nests and there's like four
07:50 or five theaters joined by this you know
07:52 red shag carpet and you know I got the
07:55 concession over here the bathroom over
07:56 here and there's like one two three and
07:58 then when you go into these theaters
07:59 they're bizarrely flat they're not like
08:04 and you know an amphitheater looking
08:07 locations it was sort of flat and then
08:09 it sort of looked like you know if
08:11 you've ever seen the old concerts that
08:14 the TV concerts Stevie Ray Vaughan did
08:16 back in the day in Texas sort of like
08:18 that kind of thing but times maybe five
08:20 in size but what I want to get at with
08:24 this episode is about you studying your
08:28 geography in your dreams how much does
08:33 it repeat does it repeat day to day like
08:36 I said for me it's repeating for a week
08:39 to two weeks and they are I wouldn't say
08:45 they're super realistic I mean they are
08:49 in the arts you know it is a very vivid
08:52 convincing world for dream world
08:57 everyone so I'll have a dream where the
08:59 dream is starting to match reality and
09:01 that is extremely rare
09:03 but when it happens it it really leaves
09:08 you with a huge smile when you wake up
09:09 in the morning because you're like oh
09:11 my god it's like I had an out-of-body
09:12 experience and I went to the so location
09:14 but the rules never really jive I mean
09:19 I've only had a couple dreams that
09:20 really jive with reality in that the
09:22 constraints I have in this world are the
09:24 constraints I had in the dream world I
09:28 had a dream once where I went into a
09:30 tourist location I think I might have
09:34 mentioned this in a previous dream
09:36 episode a million years ago but it was
09:38 this I didn't have a chance to talk to
09:42 anybody I was with a girl but I think it
09:45 was a girl in real life but I can't
09:46 quite remember but we were going yeah it
09:49 actually was a little a friend of mine
09:50 I've never met her face to face were
09:52 very good friends online but we were
09:55 going down inside this sort of cut stone
09:59 I don't want to say cavern because it's
10:02 not it's all man-made but it was some
10:05 ancient culture that had cut deep into
10:09 this I don't know I was like a
10:11 brownstone it was very beautiful was
10:13 sort of like it makes which we can grant
10:15 it and like bird's-eye maple wood it was
10:18 so it was like a brownish light brownish
10:20 thing but it was very angled and it was
10:23 just monolithic it was gigantic and you
10:26 would just follow it down go in and kind
10:28 of looking around it's sort of like if
10:29 you were to go into some alien world and
10:35 so you know no one's there
10:36 I didn't there's no artifacts or
10:38 anything I think perhaps there was a
10:42 little bit of writing on the walls that
10:43 we were kind of looking at but it was
10:45 just a tourist thing it was just we
10:46 walked down in there and that was it and
10:48 we're all kind of quiet because we're
10:50 marveling over this we're having little
10:51 small talk conversations about oh my god
10:54 how big that is this is huge this is
10:56 crazy this is insane that particular
10:58 dream had a lot of realism to it because
11:01 one it was broad daylight and as you
11:03 went down into this cut cut out artifact
11:08 place it was just you started losing
11:13 your light but you know it's all there's
11:15 all daylight outside so just you lose
11:17 about 25 50 percent of your light going
11:19 down in this thing it's never dark or
11:20 anything it's all open to the sky
11:23 now we've talked about so many things in
11:26 the dream episodes I think for me the
11:31 reason why the geography of your dream
11:33 is so profound is it tends to dictate
11:35 the action that can occur inside the
11:38 dream and so we don't typically parse
11:42 things like that in the in the kind of
11:45 Freudian conversations that I have read
11:47 I used to have two or three books that
11:49 week I've dominated them by now that
11:50 were just dream analysis books by the
11:53 Freud himself or disciples of his with
11:57 another book that was loosely sourced
12:01 and you would just literally look up
12:03 nouns and they would tell you things and
12:05 it was silly but now what's interesting
12:09 is is that obviously a lot of us assume
12:12 because there are contextual examples in
12:17 dreams that we are crafting these things
12:19 in part what is still phenomenal for the
12:24 mind or - well should say phenomenal for
12:27 us in the outside in this particular
12:30 popular reality is that again once we go
12:34 inside of a dream there you know if you
12:38 were to turn one of your dreams into a
12:40 movie on the outside you know for a fact
12:45 that it would take you millions and
12:48 millions of dollars and you would need
12:50 designers and you would have to do like
12:52 these especially if you're not an artist
12:53 I am an artist and I would tell you it
12:56 would take me just for um just for the
13:02 one I just told you about going down
13:03 into the alien cavern thing that was
13:05 pretty simple it's a short dream to
13:09 begin with I could model it and blender
13:12 3d fairly quickly kind of get an
13:14 approximation of what it was like but
13:17 you know I need a massive plugin in Maya
13:20 to get the whole crowd right or we have
13:22 to hire a bunch extras and shoot some
13:23 blue screen crap and composited together
13:25 you are doing an amazing amount of
13:28 brilliant work inside your dreams
13:30 regardless of what your talents are and
13:32 to think if you go back to your
13:34 childhood
13:35 and you think about the fact that you've
13:37 had amazing dreams like even a nightmare
13:39 who cares you are thinking that up at
13:45 least in part but now if we go an extra
13:48 step and go ahead and introduce into
13:52 this equation a variable that could be
13:56 this is the state that we get to be in
13:59 we're not inside of our bodies doesn't a
14:03 good dream feel good when you wake up
14:07 and a good dream it when I make a
14:10 distinction it's not a great dream it's
14:12 not a bad dream it's a good dream you
14:15 sort of feel like you slept better in
14:17 some cases if you have a frustrating
14:21 dream I think that's when you wake up
14:24 and you feel like you didn't sleep and
14:26 it sucks if you have a terrifying dream
14:29 oh god your sleep was completely messed
14:31 up your waking up you got to turn the
14:32 light on or whatever you got to do read
14:34 through your phone but again for those
14:39 of you are new to the dream series on
14:41 this show the big question we keep
14:44 asking is why do we have to sleep every
14:47 single day you have been told a million
14:50 reasons why this is the case from bio
14:52 clocks you know we get jet lag it's
14:54 pretty evident we're plugged into the
14:56 ecosystem of the Sun as it comes around
14:59 but some of you work night shifts and so
15:02 you're constantly backwards to everybody
15:04 else some of you're just night owls some
15:08 of you're a mega early bird you're
15:09 getting up at 3:30 and then you're dead
15:11 by 7 o'clock but for whatever reason all
15:15 beings on earth must sleep nothing gets
15:18 to be awake 24/7 except for maybe a gnat
15:22 you know certain type of insects that
15:25 just work until they die because they
15:27 have super short lifespans the birds
15:30 sleep cows sleep horses sleep fish well
15:34 they have their methods but we all have
15:40 to relax and then you just look at a cat
15:44 or a dog they shake their little legs
15:47 you know they're they're dreaming about
15:49 jumpin and you're hearing wine in their
15:52 sleep they're having a full-on dream
15:55 it's a cutest thing in the world when
15:57 you see it we're all sort of getting a
16:01 break from this reality perhaps again
16:05 we're getting an update of our code a
16:07 little Westworld
16:09 thing a dark city thing luckily we're
16:14 not getting swapped but we are getting
16:18 potentially a chance to wake up
16:21 someplace else like in my episode dream
16:23 scaping when i request a new environment
16:30 to dream inside of it shows up it's
16:34 really quite amazing and I really try to
16:36 exhaust the one that I have because I
16:38 consider each one of these locations and
16:41 this is just my silly little notion on
16:44 top of the work that's been put into it
16:48 you know I feel as if there is a crew
16:51 it's probably not true it probably if it
16:53 is it's not a lot of Labor for them who
16:55 knows again the you know it's just like
16:58 the movie Forbidden Planet where the the
17:00 aliens that are long gone the krill I
17:04 built a machine such that whatever they
17:07 could imagine would appear in the
17:09 universe if we ever embraced ether winds
17:13 and figured out what you know how to
17:14 manipulate them into the best super
17:19 sonic 3d printers you've ever heard in
17:22 your ever seen in your life there would
17:23 be nothing that we couldn't print into
17:26 reality by simply magnetically
17:28 controlling the ether winds to bond in a
17:30 particular way I'm assuming you know and
17:35 and let me just take that down one
17:37 digression for a second so you can
17:39 understand that just a little bit better
17:40 you know that if you have a headset a
17:46 wired headset and it's beautifully you
17:52 know it's it's not tangled on itself and
17:55 you then especially the Apple ones which
17:57 are just you know just butter and
17:58 they're beautiful right you can control
18:01 that
18:02 that why you know there's two things for
18:05 your ears and goes down to the plug you
18:06 can control that thing pretty damn
18:08 easily you can make all kinds of little
18:11 spaghetti shapes out of it but the
18:14 second you put it inside your purse your
18:16 backpack whatever a drawer and that damn
18:19 thing gets tangled up and then you're
18:22 trying to untangle it to get the phone
18:24 call started it is murder - get that
18:28 thing undone well I want you to think of
18:32 that analogy as ether winds that are
18:36 very loose and partically just like
18:40 water and when they come together into a
18:42 vortex and a funnel because of banging
18:44 into it their neighbors they develop a
18:47 vortex spin that is hard to stop because
18:51 they're all working together just like
18:52 water in a river and therefore if if but
18:59 you know when you get the head set right
19:00 when you finally find the extension cord
19:02 you no end and you learn how to pull
19:05 that one thing out the other thing and
19:06 it just starts unraveling beautifully
19:08 right I'm just thinking that we could
19:10 take matter and unravel it if we knew
19:13 how it worked how all those ether winds
19:15 you know do their thing and then you
19:17 could read metabolize into something
19:19 else
19:19 you talked about room temperature fusion
19:21 no problem and no problem at all
19:24 being way back to dreams what's
19:29 interesting about the settings of our
19:30 dreams is that it dictates what's
19:32 capable of happening you know if you
19:37 were wandering around a back lot of
19:39 paramount or Warner Brothers or Fox you
19:46 get to go in and out of different eras
19:48 of time it's actually pretty amazing
19:50 it's it's literally one of the most
19:51 enchanting things you can do for the
19:53 very first time in your life and so if
19:57 you walk back to the ancient you know
19:59 New York two sets the brownstones back
20:02 there you can start seeing the Twilight
20:06 zones that were filmed back there and
20:09 you could imagine a script that could be
20:12 told in that environment if you walked
20:14 into a star wars' set
20:16 you know depends on what era you're in
20:18 you and Luke Skywalker's era are you in
20:20 the prequel or you know way out sequel
20:23 well you could start telling that story
20:25 little kids would start make believing
20:28 that story and so the environments that
20:32 are created for us to have dreams are
20:33 profound and they really dictate the
20:36 spectrum of what we can do now a lot of
20:42 you will have experienced this thing
20:45 where and it's it's fascinating because
20:49 the Egyptians the Egyptians did
20:52 something really cool they did many
20:55 things that were cool but one of the
20:56 coolest things they did was they really
20:58 made door jambs and ornate thing door
21:03 jambs typically have over them raw
21:06 holding the Sun and then the big wings
21:08 that go out over the top of a doorway at
21:13 least of anything that's a temple or
21:15 what may be called a hospital by some of
21:17 the locals they really thought that
21:22 going through a door was a symbolic
21:24 thing that was very significant and so
21:29 when you're in a dream how many times
21:31 have you been in environment a and for
21:36 whatever reason some your your action in
21:39 your movie that is your dream demands
21:41 that you leave and go someplace else and
21:43 as soon as you go through the door jamb
21:46 the set changes the environment changes
21:50 suddenly you're outside but a minute ago
21:53 you were you went through that door jamb
21:55 came back in and out and you were still
21:57 inside one of the cartoony interesting
22:03 dreams I've had at least half a dozen
22:06 times in my lifetime such that I can
22:08 remember it was that you know being from
22:10 Kansas we're known for Tornado Alley
22:12 would actually call up na Colorado
22:15 Oklahoma is really well the one that has
22:17 the the massive f5 roll through there
22:22 part of the romance of Kansas being a
22:24 tornado world is because of the Wizard
22:26 of Oz
22:27 but it's planes you know it's really
22:30 flat land especially compared to most of
22:32 the world and so hey cold front hits a
22:36 warm front they roll it rains on half of
22:40 the roll and it tips the thing up and
22:42 you got a tornado and oh here it goes
22:44 and so I've had these dreams where I
22:47 will be looking at over a the landscape
22:49 of Kansas and there are like dozens and
22:54 dozens of funnel volcano air funnels
22:56 Foucault's final tornadoes that are
22:59 picking up debris they're not really
23:03 hitting any towns or you know there's no
23:04 sparks on the ground it's not that
23:06 realistic but the tornadoes sort of look
23:08 like caricatures of tornadoes but their
23:10 photo real and what's funny is is that
23:13 the clouds are sort of lighting each one
23:16 of the tornadoes separately and it's got
23:17 this sepia tone to it and very much like
23:20 Wizard of Oz and I've had that dream a
23:24 couple times where I'm with a group of
23:26 friends that feel like family family and
23:29 friends together and we go out and we're
23:32 looking at these things and of course in
23:33 reality they would be devastatingly
23:36 deadly and there would be that you know
23:39 seeing half a dozen of them or these the
23:41 spread cheese for my dreams it's
23:43 probably a dozen and a half they are in
23:48 the dream it feels like they're an
23:50 odyssey for me to watch my brain won't
23:52 let them come close so they're just out
23:55 there it's interesting because video
24:00 games creating all of these interesting
24:03 fictitious buildings these fictional
24:06 locations where you might play a shooter
24:08 game you know we're all doing sort of a
24:09 deathmatch or team thing you as a player
24:17 you've now experienced and I've
24:19 experienced tons of these environments
24:20 that don't exist Duke Nukem world's all
24:25 the tombs all the quakes and countless
24:28 other games pray and so that starts to
24:32 curb how my brain will build a building
24:37 and then allow me to go through it about
24:40 two days ago
24:41 I was tasked with going from like one
24:45 place to another within this building
24:46 and it's carpeted and it's nice but it's
24:49 sort of that that British interior
24:53 design where everything has got a
24:55 beautiful sort of super modern white
24:58 finish when I was over there in 2000 had
25:04 a lot of red and white together with
25:07 black trim and it was very interesting
25:10 it is a beautiful stuff like you want to
25:12 go to a closet there's no door there's
25:14 no handle on the outside is no hardware
25:16 you just push on it and it's got a
25:17 little you know a little relief magnet
25:20 it was cool and so I was going through
25:22 this building it felt very European and
25:26 at one point I had found myself and some
25:29 weird mezzanine of the construction
25:32 where I was sort of in a place that I
25:34 wasn't supposed to be and it had these
25:35 interesting sort of grilles like these
25:38 hexagonal grilles on the wall like a
25:40 like a Lamborghini grille or something
25:42 it was all silver and I'm just in there
25:45 and I'm crawling around you know I'm
25:47 thinking about God I got myself in the
25:48 wrong place I gotta get the hell out of
25:49 here and of course my brain immediately
25:51 creates a hatch that opens up it's like
25:53 a Doctor Who episode where I've always
25:55 I'm always safe I can always find a
25:57 place to get out and never really that
25:59 scared just a little bit of caution and
26:03 so I can feel my brain crafting this
26:06 world as I experience it because I want
26:09 to get out of here oh here's the door
26:10 boom I get out of there and I don't have
26:12 to crawl it's not like some Jefferies
26:14 tube I just find a thing kind of pull
26:16 myself up and I don't really have a body
26:18 so I am getting where I need to go but
26:23 then there are rules for outside versus
26:25 inside I will have homes that are sort
26:33 of beach houses there's this house that
26:38 I do not believe I've ever actually been
26:40 in in real life but I continually dream
26:42 of it and it's like a beach house that
26:44 you might find down the street where it
26:47 has a garage underneath one end and then
26:49 the loft sort of the living room is
26:52 above the garage and the way that the
26:54 soils pushed
26:54 you know the garages the whole house is
26:56 actually up on a little rise of soil and
27:01 then of course the garage is underneath
27:03 and you just drive right in to your
27:05 driveway and you walk up the way there's
27:06 a lot of houses like this around here
27:09 but I've had this this house that
27:11 constantly appears and it's very you
27:15 know magic our to dusk tonight it's
27:18 never morning and it's kind of just got
27:23 sofas and beds everywhere but I've had
27:27 this species of dream that is actually
27:30 pretty phenomenal pretty different
27:33 well that helicopter just has one red
27:36 light on it that thing is hauling ass
27:42 Wow but I've had a reoccurring set of
27:47 dreams which the environment changes
27:49 just a little bit and it I'll be in a
27:55 city and it'll have skyscrapers around
28:00 me and look up in the sky and it sort of
28:04 turns into like an Independence Day or a
28:07 bunch of UFOs start flying in and
28:09 they're huge they're not big round disks
28:11 flying over the entire city they're
28:12 ships like out of a video game and i
28:18 i've had varying levels of this where i
28:21 can't tell what year i'm in i can't tell
28:24 if what i'm about to see is absolutely
28:26 2019 crazy wild or if i'm in some
28:31 hundred years from now where this thing
28:33 of about the witness makes sense for any
28:37 of the you that have seen the movie of
28:39 valaria on the first five ten minutes of
28:41 valeri on you will know that they have
28:43 that scene where all these ships fall
28:44 out of the sky and crashed into the
28:46 ground lots of things have done it
28:48 especially video game cutscenes but i've
28:51 had about half a dozen of those where
28:53 i'm looking up in this guy and what is
28:55 up happening is there are a bunch of
28:57 UFOs coming in and essentially they're
29:00 very intelligent looking they're not
29:02 saucers they're not white discs they're
29:04 very intelligent looking spaceships okay
29:06 and the
29:08 out of nowhere as if mankind
29:12 you know the ruling class or whatever
29:14 has hidden these the fleet of spaceships
29:18 of their own they come out of nowhere
29:20 and they start doing a battle up in the
29:24 sky and I've had this happen in sort of
29:27 daytime haziness about twenty ten to
29:30 twenty years ago but more recently has
29:32 been this sort of I don't know it's like
29:35 that video game destiny very beautiful
29:39 night scenes and you know these things
29:42 come down and they take out buildings
29:44 and they explode and just sort of
29:46 sitting in some sort of like derelict
29:49 parking lot or something that's that's
29:51 big enough that I I don't fear for my
29:53 life I'm just literally just looking at
29:55 the details of the ships and watching
29:58 the battle occur it's just amazing
30:01 whereas in real life I don't know
30:03 exactly what I would do because there's
30:05 no sense of comfort because if one of
30:09 these things comes down you're gonna die
30:11 if you're in the building you're gonna
30:12 die if you're outside the building so
30:14 just hope they don't hit you but I had
30:20 this dream and I'll just share a couple
30:21 of this a little bit of this technology
30:24 with you just in case you find it
30:25 interesting to listen to I was uh I've
30:31 had a couple dreams now to dreams where
30:33 I felt like one I felt like I was
30:37 literally in the future and it was super
30:40 duper real I have described this once
30:42 before but I'll see if I can't do a
30:44 better job this time around it was broad
30:46 daylight it was in sort of a lush sort
30:48 of green area it wasn't like a forest
30:53 but it was dense with kind of trees that
30:57 were very very like it was it like Marat
31:01 not was it you know like Zelda one like
31:03 the Zelda series way back in the day
31:05 when the trees are kind of puffy and
31:06 they're all close together something
31:08 like that we don't have a lot of those
31:09 places in the United States where I am
31:12 but there was this beautiful gazebo
31:15 thing that was sort of super futuristic
31:17 look like Elvin
31:20 architecture but it wasn't of course and
31:23 so there was this sofa this really long
31:26 thin sofa with a back on it but instead
31:29 of having the arms the arms actually
31:31 went the other way and went down and
31:34 just before I hit the ground it would
31:35 stop you noticed all rounded off and
31:37 very beautiful I didn't go up and sit
31:39 down on it but I remember looking at it
31:40 and I'm looking over and there was this
31:42 sort of clubhouse sort of thing but out
31:46 in front of the clubhouse I looked down
31:48 and I'm looking at this sort of light
31:51 purple and maybe like normal purple sort
31:58 of landing bay thing is sort of like
32:01 instead of having concrete it's just
32:04 shiny stuff and then on it are this
32:08 these light blue steel inlays where
32:13 these ships were coming in and landing
32:15 and it was getting picked up there was
32:16 landing it's like little landing feet
32:18 will come out and stick into these
32:20 crevices like a like a muse rip park
32:22 ride you know where it's grabbing it and
32:24 taking it along and it would simply just
32:27 take the car away
32:28 people would hop out the whole thing is
32:30 kind of turning at the same time just
32:32 like a Disneyland ride so you can kind
32:33 of hop out and you're all moving at the
32:35 same time and you're expect to get out
32:36 before the car goes into the garage or
32:38 whatever the hell if the place was going
32:40 and so that happened ten years ago it
32:45 was stunning and the reason why I
32:47 mentioned that is there was enough grade
32:48 to it recently in my dream that was
32:50 really cool I'm watching a very
32:55 similar-looking place of acceptance at
32:58 nighttime in a minute City when I get
33:01 the sense that behind me was sort of
33:03 like the nightclub and these ships were
33:07 coming in luxury ships not too large a
33:11 lot of size of a car but their designs
33:13 were just while looking I mean I here's
33:17 the here's the catch the ships were made
33:20 out of strips of metal about I'd say 2
33:24 inches sort of a round rectangle rods
33:28 and they all sort of came together to
33:31 build the car
33:32 a ton of them and it sort of held
33:34 together maybe magnetically or something
33:35 and so here's the cool part I'm looking
33:39 down at the ground which have these
33:40 interesting slats in the ground a little
33:42 bit different than the other ones in a
33:44 different color scheme this is more
33:45 orange or purple like there's orange
33:47 highlights inside purple was cool so the
33:50 the little little ducts were lined with
33:53 like this beautiful tangerine sort of
33:56 lit orange with this kind of deep purple
34:01 because it wasn't lit very well at night
34:02 and I'm watching these people land and
34:05 here's what was happening the vehicle
34:07 would land and as it starts landing it
34:09 starts unraveling the vehicle out of
34:12 these made of these slats that go from
34:15 the nose to the to the trunk and so
34:20 these things were unraveling and going
34:23 into the slats in the ground and the
34:24 whole vehicle would disappear into the
34:26 ground leaving the passengers standing
34:29 up and so they were able to just walk
34:32 into the nightclub it was awesome
34:36 now here's the thing I'm not thinking
34:40 about this stuff during the day how the
34:43 hell is my brain coming up with this
34:45 amazing engineering this you know for
34:48 for this day and age an impossible
34:50 engineering task it's not impossible but
34:53 juice it would be amazing and these
34:55 vehicles are gorgeous I mean they were
34:57 definitely you got the sense of rich
34:59 people getting out of these things
35:01 dressed to the hill ready to go and I
35:06 get the sense that it was like if you
35:09 took a kid out of like 1850 and you took
35:12 him up to Jesus who knows 1985 or
35:15 whatever and you take him in you put him
35:19 at the end of a runway that's nice safe
35:22 location far enough away give him a
35:25 little headgear see doesn't hurt his
35:26 ears or whatever and he could just sit
35:28 there and watch planes take off all day
35:29 long to us we get bored after the first
35:34 takeoff we see the stuff all the time no
35:36 big deal
35:37 but I'm sitting there watching these
35:39 cars land and unravel and I'm just like
35:41 oh my god
35:42 that is so bitchin that is so cool
35:46 I could have sat there all day watching
35:49 that I probably watched three or four
35:51 cars disappear before I was like the
35:54 hell am I you know so one of the reasons
35:58 why I'm making this episode is to sort
35:59 of communicate with I'm doing to have a
36:02 different experience over and over and
36:04 over again within Suites of Dreams so
36:08 again I might keep an environment for a
36:11 week to two weeks and what in sub
36:14 started what ends up happening for me is
36:16 that the themes inside these locations I
36:21 hate to admit it but they sort of get
36:23 dark
36:24 it's like the people get kind of
36:26 cantankerous with me and they're almost
36:29 saying you know without saying anything
36:32 it's almost the feeling is like well I'm
36:34 not welcome here right now anymore it's
36:36 time for me to change and there could be
36:39 me infecting it more than them infecting
36:41 and who knows of course I'm talking
36:42 about them as if they really exist
36:45 my dreams are typically dreams of
36:48 camaraderie whatever dream people are
36:52 there were friends and we hang out we
36:54 have a good time and there's rarely you
36:57 know anyone trying to cause problems I
37:01 have dreams too right remember exactly
37:04 where it was one of them is of my
37:06 hometown which if you go to that address
37:10 I showed you just go down on Main Street
37:11 and take a look around
37:13 but the little dude down the ground take
37:14 a look around that's that's my hometown
37:16 man but there's one where my town is
37:21 sort of in the future at least 100 years
37:24 in the future someone has taken the
37:26 downtown and and preserved the
37:28 storefronts and the front but they've
37:30 behind those buildings they've built up
37:33 two-story three-story four-story
37:35 beautiful connecting buildings so it's
37:38 kind of like this walk along mall that
37:40 you can do at whatever story you want to
37:42 do when they built like Plaza is behind
37:45 there so you can really have a good time
37:46 I want to go back to that when I've been
37:50 there two or three times and it's more I
37:53 actually was able to go up into the
37:55 buildings on
37:56 Euler visit and then the other ones
37:59 I'm just spectating out you know there
38:02 it is you know but now I mentioned in my
38:07 episode two space exists this weird
38:10 phenomenon and we've we've had more
38:11 people report in that they have these
38:12 dreams but every time I ask them to
38:14 elaborate only a couple of them actually
38:16 ever elaborate where again the weird
38:20 thing is that it's not weird for us
38:24 let's just say you live in America your
38:26 whole life or you live in Europe your
38:27 whole life you've never been to America
38:29 we've never been to where you live it's
38:31 it's not at all surprising that I don't
38:36 dream about being in places I've never
38:37 been before okay I will play a video
38:43 gaem though like again back in the quake
38:46 days especially quake days I would play
38:49 a video game for 14 hours straight at EA
38:51 with my buddies over a weekend and I
38:54 would dream being there I don't know how
38:57 here it is but it means I'm at that
38:59 location and running around and so I
39:03 have friends that have been in the
39:04 visual effects business for 25 years
39:06 they have more gold statues and you can
39:10 shake a hand at shake a stick as excuse
39:12 me or your hand okay they have never
39:16 dreamed of being in space so they'll
39:19 work on sagas you know like the
39:21 Battlestar Galactica saga all the Star
39:23 Trek's
39:24 all these movies spaceship spaceship
39:27 spaceship I can you know my old co-host
39:29 he still does that all the time
39:31 he has laid cameras inside of virtual
39:35 spaceships and flown them around and
39:36 figured out where the shot is for 20
39:39 years straight and has never had a dream
39:42 once working sometimes 16-hour days
39:46 never once had a dream of being in one
39:50 of these spaceships and so he goes to
39:51 work after I spring the episode on him
39:53 and he asked all of his friends at work
39:56 have any of you guys had a dream of
39:58 being in space and they all just looked
40:01 at each other and we're like no holy
40:05 [ __ ] how's that even possible
40:07 and some guys are like I dream lucid
40:09 dreams and all this other crap right
40:12 nothing again some of you said you've
40:16 done it usually the explanations are
40:20 extremely abstract what's interesting is
40:24 is the places that I dream of I've never
40:25 been in most cases I've never been there
40:29 so my brain is synthesizing stuff
40:32 together because we can't take a screen
40:36 capture of our dreams and then analyze
40:39 it against our life history you know it
40:42 may be taking something from your
40:44 hometown and mixing it with an airport
40:47 you were ad versus a mall you were at
40:49 versus something you saw on television
40:52 the amount of times I have dreamed of
40:55 collaborating with a group of people in
40:56 an office is a lot it's very fun it's
41:01 like we're doing something interesting
41:03 which is really cool what I'm trying to
41:07 do I think over time here for myself and
41:10 hopefully with you guys is to get you to
41:12 realize that perhaps even if you can't
41:16 directly grab the stick shift
41:19 and the steering wheel to your dreams
41:20 that you can potentially affect your
41:24 dreams by that maybe there are some
41:27 things you can do just prior to going to
41:29 bed the sort of take on the attitude of
41:31 what you actually want to experience
41:33 when you go to sleep how many people
41:36 have nightmares and potentially the
41:38 reason why they replicate themselves
41:40 night after night is as you go into bed
41:44 you are fearing it and therefore it
41:49 becomes what your thought is as you go
41:52 to bed so it's important that you think
41:58 of something wonderful you know like
42:00 happy gilmore think of your happy place
42:01 they have a dream you've had that you
42:03 love think of something in real life
42:05 that you love I find the one thing that
42:09 makes me really tired I think I said
42:11 this once before way back when when I
42:15 used to put the mic up against my face
42:16 destroy the sound ring
42:19 come on episode 41 as of the recording
42:22 of this episode of mine episode 41 of
42:25 season one and I'm remastering and
42:26 there's just digital distortion I just
42:29 can't get rid of it's crazy because I
42:30 put the mic against my mouth I apologize
42:32 folks but I think that you can if you go
42:40 to bed and you close your eyes and you
42:42 think of realistic things in your life
42:44 you can keep yourself up all night and
42:46 give yourself a little anxiety attacks
42:48 right now hopefully your life is going
42:51 great and what you're thinking about in
42:52 your real life is just wonderful
42:54 I find that thinking of fictional worlds
42:58 puts me to sleep beautifully when I
43:04 first saw like Roger the rabbit
43:08 god bless the makers of that film and
43:11 Charles Fleischer and I guess his name
43:12 does an amazing job I don't like that
43:15 film I don't like the way it feels I
43:17 like to guy that plays the Mario
43:18 Brothers dude that dude is his sidekick
43:20 I like him as an actor like other things
43:22 that he's done I just don't like that
43:23 movie it just doesn't feel right to me
43:25 there's something weird about it
43:29 but I did use that dream after I started
43:32 use that movie after that dream came
43:34 goddamnit I used that movie after it
43:36 came out to think about the environments
43:41 and sort of being because there's a
43:42 point where I think they go into the
43:43 cartoon world 100% I believe
43:46 towards the end and I think I thought
43:49 about going into that world it was the
43:51 very first time it was successful for me
43:53 were trying to hang on to complete
43:55 fiction in my mind consciously which is
43:59 essentially us me thinking about putting
44:04 in the effort to do what my dreams do
44:05 automatically I was synthesizing the
44:07 world in my mind which is utterly
44:10 exhausting oh yeah look at a car what's
44:13 it look like my brain automatically as
44:15 I'm going to bed has to manifest some
44:16 car design in cartoon form right the
44:20 balance and squash animation techniques
44:22 and all that good stuff it was
44:25 exhausting and so I went to bed and so
44:27 after then I started just thinking about
44:30 scenarios the
44:32 sort of fantasy scenarios what I don't
44:37 know is is the geography of our dreams
44:42 does it reveal something about us I have
44:47 to assume that does I have to assume
44:50 there's a spectrum of your imagination
44:52 which is odd because when you lose
44:55 consciousness you're in an absolute
44:59 make-believe world so why is there any
45:03 constraint on what we think why can't I
45:08 think about space you know again I have
45:10 seen every single Star Trek episode
45:12 between 1 and 5 times 1 for the ones I
45:19 don't really like but I think I've seen
45:21 every one of them 2 times at least
45:23 minimum and why when I binge watch Star
45:26 Trek while I'm coding or I'm doing
45:28 something else like when I got my TV in
45:31 front of me like 10 feet away and I got
45:32 my laptop and I'm just doing my thing
45:35 why am I not dreaming of that it's a
45:41 fond location you realize how absolutely
45:46 a static I would be to wake up on any
45:48 one of the enterprise ships with that
45:50 crew around me go to 10 Ford get a drink
45:55 from Whoopi Goldberg before she joined
45:57 the view talk with data a little bit
46:00 playing a little game about 3d chess
46:02 thing would they'd even if there's no
46:04 rules I can understand hanging out with
46:07 Captain Kirk Spock go down to Planet
46:10 chill out a little bit none of that I've
46:14 never had a dream of being on a Star
46:17 Destroyer
46:19 you know lynnium Falcon how many times
46:23 we've seen those movies I've seen Blade
46:25 Runner I don't know I think we
46:27 exaggerated some of the numbers but I'm
46:29 gonna say 60 to 100 times somewhere in
46:35 there never had a dream of being in that
46:38 world ever and what's weird is I have
46:41 dreams of cities all the time I'm
46:43 running around inside of a city I'm
46:44 driving inside of a city
46:46 I'm in buildings but I've never been to
46:48 the Tyrell corporation I never been in
46:52 was a caffee's nightclub Deckard's
46:56 apartment why is there this weird
47:01 limiter it's not my lack of imagination
47:04 I guarantee you that the other thing
47:09 that doesn't seem to occur is I don't
47:11 seem to leave my period of time except
47:15 to perhaps go forward in time in the
47:18 future I don't find myself in the 1800s
47:22 I would love to have a dream of being in
47:25 Deadwood South Dakota going to the the
47:29 gem saloon and meets Warren I mean come
47:33 on
47:33 to go into a King Arthur 1981 Excalibur
47:38 movie castle and see what it looks like
47:41 never happens you go to Rome back in the
47:46 day man
47:47 call seemed bumpin see a chariot race
47:52 you'd a rat on a stick what's causing
47:55 this limitation I've been in you know
47:59 I'm no longer in it but I used to be in
48:00 the video game business forever
48:03 surrounded by imagination you know it
48:06 was my job to come up with the next best
48:09 thing all the time
48:10 with a huge group of other people and
48:15 the other than the the building type
48:18 simulations again like the doom quake
48:21 stuff it's weird to think that I've
48:24 probably played World of Warcraft like I
48:27 can't stand the game anymore I mean I
48:29 can't stand the game anymore
48:31 I just turned it on for a month using
48:33 gold I logged in twice and was like this
48:36 this is awful now they've completely
48:38 destroyed that game but I have played it
48:40 for she's combining all the characters
48:44 almost a whole year straight at least
48:50 200 days at least
48:52 I forgot I think last time I did it was
48:54 several years ago and I was like my main
48:56 character I played for a hundred and
48:57 forty-four days
48:59 scary never had a dream of being in the
49:02 or kamar how awesome would that be
49:04 looking around going holy crap this
49:06 place is real what's really cool is I've
49:10 seen some comments on the Facebook page
49:11 where you guys are hip to frontiers that
49:17 are right in front of our face that we
49:19 have a chance to parse I think that and
49:25 you know here we are we're just some
49:28 about 4,000 people on YouTube you know
49:33 people have thought of almost everything
49:34 and they've gone down these paths and
49:36 books and and things that we just
49:38 haven't seen their research and so we're
49:41 joining everyone's Club sort of through
49:43 our own little research programs but
49:47 dreams are huge there's been a
49:48 tremendous amount of exploration of
49:50 dreams and we're still it sort of sort
49:52 of ground zero but I will tell you this
49:54 out of all the books that I have
49:56 consumed on the subject matter everyone
50:00 gets really seemingly and again if you
50:03 guys have read books and seen things
50:05 that touch on the stuff I'm talking
50:06 about and have talked about please point
50:08 me in that direction but we seem to get
50:12 caught up in the mundane just like the
50:15 moon missions in this channel alone we
50:19 have pioneered things that no one else
50:21 has thought about we have moved to level
50:24 two or three of the moon mission hoax
50:27 evidence pool more Occam's razor proofs
50:32 that we didn't go OK in dreams and my
50:38 research you know Freud had very sort of
50:43 and I respect him for it you know he he
50:45 just made decisions about what things
50:47 meant well that means this BAM okay
50:52 there's something about and I don't know
50:57 if I didn't really mention this in what
50:59 our facts episode I probably should have
51:02 there I mentioned it in other episodes
51:04 but there was this point where there is
51:06 a point I think in most people's lives
51:08 where you do get tired of tiptoeing
51:10 around
51:12 things that didn't seem seem empirical
51:14 like proven they happened too much you
51:18 may not completely understand what it is
51:20 but that happens you know I used to try
51:23 to talk to you guys way back in season
51:25 one I definitely nem K old to radio in a
51:30 way that was like I would use those
51:32 terms like you know loosely you know
51:37 like allegedly and supposedly and that
51:39 kind of stuff and I still hold that for
51:42 you know drastic accusations towards
51:44 other human beings of which I have no
51:46 proof but there's a point where you just
51:51 start throwing it out you just start
51:53 throwing out you know Einstein stuff you
51:56 just gotta throw it out you know the guy
51:58 barely contributed to reality and he's
52:01 got the you know this this badge on him
52:04 that he's like the absolute pinnacle of
52:08 intelligence in this universe right it
52:11 just gets you get tired of it so at one
52:13 point I understand Freud just throwing
52:14 it down but anyway most of the books
52:16 that I have bought and I I want to say
52:18 that the only one that's different is
52:20 the ones that we start reading the
52:22 Freudian psychology which again other
52:25 divisions of psychology or psychiatry so
52:29 he's completely full of [ __ ] but you
52:32 will get to a point where you read just
52:35 about dream translations people got it
52:38 all figured out it's really like tarot
52:40 card reading like prince said and under
52:42 the tree moon you just tell people what
52:44 they want to hear and they'll make it
52:45 happen I've never heard anyone in this
52:49 planet say either in book magazine
52:52 internet that we don't have bodies when
52:55 we dream that's all an illusion that as
53:00 as we join a dream there is a stage of
53:06 realization it's almost like teleporting
53:09 into the Tron environment back in 1982
53:12 your body comes naked and then the
53:14 clothes rez on top of you and then
53:16 something or your your light cycle res
53:18 is in your hand it's like one two three
53:20 and these things happen which is why you
53:22 end up naked in your dreams
53:24 because the you res naked in a room and
53:28 you realize before your clothes get
53:32 added inside your consciousness again
53:33 you don't have a body but you feel like
53:36 you do you're focusing on the fact that
53:39 people are seeing you nude and sometimes
53:41 that'll create an Arrested Development
53:43 in the process and you will stay naked
53:45 and then your trauma ties if you're not
53:48 used to being naked around strangers
53:49 hurry I have at least one friend who
53:54 said that he would have a lot of sex in
53:56 his dreams and then it became a problem
54:01 for him as a young men if you could just
54:02 read between the lines there I never
54:05 have I mean I mean I've I have sexual
54:08 encounters very rarely in dreams and
54:10 it's so short-lived you know it happens
54:13 four seconds before my brain just starts
54:15 I don't know it maybe maybe I get so
54:21 blown away by the fact that's occurring
54:23 that my brain gets nervous or something
54:26 that it's gonna go away cuz it's so
54:27 great into my brain you know some
54:29 [ __ ] always walks in the room that's
54:30 the thing it's just like those movies or
54:33 TV shows when two people about to kiss
54:35 you've been waiting you know five
54:37 seasons for it's like Daphne and Niles
54:43 kissing for the first time in Frasier
54:45 you've been waiting and waiting and
54:47 waiting for their lips to touch and
54:49 finally you you get your wish you know
54:52 eventually what a great show that is
54:56 we're trying to be enlightened with what
54:59 we can deduce about dreams right and so
55:02 in my mind
55:04 enlightenment in one metaphor is to
55:06 climb higher and see more because you
55:08 have more elevation it's a crude
55:11 metaphor but it's there and so for me
55:15 the scaffolding is based on all these
55:18 little things that we have put into this
55:20 dream sequence of episodes in this show
55:24 and just you guys know I don't mention
55:27 this often enough every single video
55:29 should be in a playlist somewhere if
55:32 it's not I have made a mistake in
55:34 uploading the video
55:37 but I have a dream playlist if you're
55:39 interested in this kind of stuff go back
55:40 to the dream playlist and just cruise
55:43 through them but as always this is our
55:48 new virtual University I need your your
55:51 participation I need not only your
55:54 experiences communicated and you know
55:56 man
55:57 we've got some awesome comments in the
55:58 dream videos but I need your deduction I
56:01 need your intelligence even if I'm
56:03 mentioning something that you've never
56:05 had pretend to be my psychiatrist or my
56:09 psychologist pretend to be my scientist
56:12 you know you're working you know I'm
56:14 your patient I don't want you to think
56:17 it through really think it through try
56:20 to come up with an interesting like we
56:23 say in the screenplay business crack it
56:27 crack the hook crack the reason why this
56:30 movie is so good that little twist you
56:32 know you know a fantasy hope of mine
56:36 would be we cracked something in this
56:40 series between all of us and then the
56:45 subscribers of this show we get to live
56:48 an enlightened life and we get to teach
56:50 others what we've learned something
56:54 tangible something that everyone can do
56:57 it's like I keep saying by the way you
57:01 guys I'm going to digress for one second
57:03 for some of you bear with me okay cuz
57:06 either you hate the subject to death
57:07 I've been a meeting the other day with a
57:09 good friend of mine super guy and he
57:14 turns to me he has no idea this show
57:17 exists by the way I won't tell him I
57:20 don't know when he would think about
57:22 that he turns to me and he goes we're at
57:24 lunch in this beautiful Rose cafe in
57:27 Santa Monica it's very famous and he
57:29 says what do you think about this whole
57:31 flat earth thing I'm sitting there
57:34 looking at him like did you just say
57:36 that and of course I can't go I've known
57:39 a [ __ ] ton of episodes on it man it's
57:42 just funny eventually I'll tell them all
57:43 I'll share the show with I don't know a
57:45 little bit more but you know whether you
57:48 can digest this kind of stuff I did
57:49 throw some moon stuff at him
57:51 it was very receptive but then we went
57:54 through the the flatterer thing that the
57:57 reason why I'm mentioning it in this
57:58 episode is very important okay we have
58:02 this claim by flatus pilots again you've
58:07 heard this a million times if you've
58:09 heard the episodes but I'm carry this
58:11 back to this episode okay that the
58:13 gyroscope doesn't turn no matter if you
58:15 travel halfway around the world and uh
58:18 you know was it
58:21 latitude right vertical up and down
58:25 north south it's supposed to stay
58:27 perpendicular to wherever you start from
58:29 so again
58:31 when did the Cairo should be kind of
58:33 sideways by the time we get to Cairo
58:34 because you've flown halfway around the
58:35 world okay so you hear this claim a
58:39 bunch but no one's ever taken the
58:40 photograph but I know if no one's ever
58:42 filmed it with a video camera with their
58:44 phone for God's sakes right just get one
58:47 of those suction cup things and put it
58:48 right there on the on a dashboard of
58:51 your jet and just film it someone's
58:54 gotta be have a g5 rights it's not like
58:56 you're gonna be you know violating some
58:59 FAA law or whatever they call it in
59:01 Europe but people fly from San Francisco
59:06 to Mexico City all the time so take a
59:09 picture of it show me it doesn't change
59:11 so the same thing applies for dreams if
59:16 you know what I say is if that was that
59:18 easy then everyone could film it and
59:20 every pilots gonna go oh my god we're on
59:22 a flat disc what Duff no fudge what I
59:28 have found with dreams and talking to
59:31 people since I started this show and I
59:33 never had any of these epiphanies before
59:35 I made this show and trying to make
59:37 episodes and trying to come up with
59:39 interesting things that interest me so
59:40 hopefully interest you I have scraped
59:45 out of my own consciousness my own
59:47 realization these other things you know
59:50 try it you know go up to one of your
59:53 friends who you're close with your
59:55 girlfriend your boyfriend your parent
59:56 whatever your buddy your bestie
60:00 and just say you know do you dream yeah
60:03 once well do you ever realize we don't
60:07 really have bodies when we dream what
60:10 yeah we don't really have any bodies
60:12 when we drink next time you drink see if
60:14 you can get into your body like feel it
60:17 and try to pick up a pen and write
60:19 something as soon as you got to use your
60:23 fingers a symbolic thing that you call
60:26 your body and a dream starts to become
60:28 jelly it's a wet noodle no the other
60:33 thing you might do and I I'm really not
60:35 a self-promoter you know for this show I
60:38 feel like it needs to earn your
60:40 viewership by engaging you and again
60:45 some people don't watch black-and-white
60:46 and subdued sitting on his patio smoking
60:48 cigars it just bothers them I understand
60:50 I totally get it but if they are
60:53 interested point about the show and
60:55 point them out that the dream playlist
60:57 and say if you dig dreams and you want
61:00 to get into this you want to watch this
61:01 guy and then just get it because we're
61:03 trying to get as many minds into the
61:05 deciphering of dreams in my opinion as
61:08 absolutely possible and you know we're
61:12 blessed to have some folks and I I don't
61:15 remember your names right offhand but we
61:17 have a couple folks that are baby
61:20 boomers one gentleman identified himself
61:22 as a 71 year old viewer the amount of
61:29 compliment I feel by having someone 71
61:32 years old watching this show is beyond
61:34 description it's it's awesome you know a
61:38 49 year old guy could keep anyone who's
61:39 71 you know interested something I have
61:42 to say I can't imagine watching someone
61:44 30 years younger than me at this point
61:46 making a video it happens all the time
61:48 but I appreciate the viewership so any
61:52 of you that are say over 50 and even
61:56 further out the further out more the
61:57 further out you are your opinion is
62:00 actually really interesting to me
62:02 because you've had more experience
62:04 you've had more incidental conversations
62:07 more specific conversations potentially
62:09 you've had
62:10 millions of more dreams than any one of
62:13 us have had who are younger and so your
62:17 insight is pure wisdom how do you dream
62:22 what are the best dreams you've ever had
62:25 some of you have talked about dreams
62:28 that then spilled over into your real
62:30 life almost like a premonition that's
62:35 interesting I can't say I've had a
62:38 single dream that turned into a
62:40 premonition I can say that I've had my
62:45 day dreams are the ones where I have the
62:47 the weird future prediction dreams I
62:50 mean are they dreams you know like I
62:51 said 9/11 and that kind of stuff there's
62:56 something going on there's something
62:58 going on and I don't know I have this
63:02 distinct feeling and we're gonna kind of
63:04 divert away from the dream thing to
63:05 close this thing off so hopefully guys
63:07 don't mind I have this this is not an
63:11 epiphany of any you know unique
63:14 magnitude but the idea is that I believe
63:17 thoroughly that the more I open my mind
63:21 especially to create episodes you know
63:26 it used to be that I just lived my life
63:27 and I would analyze things and write
63:28 them into notebooks like I've said
63:29 previously now I live my life I analyze
63:33 it and then I make episodes and then I
63:37 more thoroughly analyze the information
63:40 because I'm talking for an hour plus by
63:45 the way I didn't realize it my first
63:46 two-hour episode was episode 40 way back
63:49 in the day I thought it was 26 which got
63:52 pretty close to two hours for the moon
63:54 mission but what I want to get happening
63:58 with this the subs on this show is that
64:01 it's almost as if I what I want to
64:04 communicate with you guys is that if
64:07 you're having an experience remotely
64:09 like mine in ingesting these episodes
64:12 and again one of you came in and you
64:15 gave me a beautiful compliment you said
64:16 look I watched two hundred shows or
64:18 really liked them I don't always agree
64:19 with what you say
64:21 my hope is that I've engaged your belief
64:24 system even more so that you believe
64:26 what you believe even more that's a huge
64:29 benefit to your life you know but by by
64:33 discussing these things in the most my
64:35 new detail in some cases were not only
64:41 becoming perhaps enlightened between us
64:43 because we're communicating with each
64:44 other everybody can see everybody else's
64:46 comments and again if you go into
64:47 Facebook's a little bit different
64:49 Facebook sort of we just analyze things
64:53 we analyze everything it's such a
64:56 fantastic group I mean I belong to I
64:59 will put this way over the what is 11
65:02 years or 10 years I mean I could maybe
65:05 it's 10 years 10 years I've been on
65:07 Facebook I can't even believe I said
65:08 that
65:09 you know I've longed to groups in there
65:12 people you know I might admire something
65:14 like bucketheads groups pretty cool but
65:17 it's just not riveting you know the
65:19 comments are kind of you know I'm
65:21 wondering every 10 is interesting on our
65:22 Facebook page it's interesting all day
65:25 long by the way one of our listeners
65:28 gave me just want to mention this
65:30 because I didn't let it go through we're
65:32 just like I don't even know the only the
65:35 only comments I don't let go through on
65:37 Facebook are ones where someone's
65:38 attached to content that is no longer
65:40 visible probably because it's behind
65:42 another locked group and there's you
65:44 can't share between lock groups you know
65:46 anyway someone left me or post it to the
65:51 group a beautiful model walking down a
65:55 runway and her name is um Ciara Skye yes
66:01 Kye I think very beautiful girl she was
66:05 just walking being beautiful and he just
66:07 shared it I was like hey man it's a good
66:09 content I can't say didn't share with a
66:11 few friends of mine but I can't put it
66:12 on the Facebook page cuz it's just gonna
66:14 draw a lot of criticism so dude it was a
66:17 good post but I just couldn't let it on
66:20 the group okay but otherwise we're
66:23 pretty we're pretty out there but what I
66:24 want to have happen to what I'm trying
66:26 to get out of my mouth here is I want
66:29 every single one of us at least at a
66:30 single dimension if not as many as you
66:32 can come up with to start seeing
66:34 more in this reality that you that you
66:38 previously didn't see before we started
66:40 having these discussions and then dear
66:44 God please bring it back to us and share
66:46 it if you can't make a video about it
66:49 post it on your own little channel post
66:52 it directly to Facebook and share it
66:53 with the group Dave who's one of our
66:57 moderators for the Facebook page he
67:01 takes these incredible pictures of stars
67:03 zoomed up with his camera and again I
67:05 mentioned it on several episodes the
67:08 phenomenon what we're seeing is really
67:11 odd like stars and Mohawks on them it
67:13 looks like balls some sort of tapestry
67:18 but have a constant stream of plasma
67:20 going over them and again he's shaking
67:23 the camera left and right the atmosphere
67:24 is wiggling in these Mohawk stay
67:26 perfectly in place so it can't be the
67:29 analog to digital sensor and the camera
67:31 and it can't be the atmosphere because
67:33 those would keep that Mohawk swimming
67:34 all over the place and you see those
67:35 videos to everyone someone but the ones
67:38 with the Mohawks he seems to get quite
67:40 frequently it's it's a huge deal but
67:43 we're kind of looking at like what
67:44 everyone looks like through that camera
67:47 someone took a picture of the moon
67:49 really close up and he just goes man I
67:51 can't believe this thing is you know 200
67:54 and he said 280 thousand miles but even
67:56 if it's only two hundred and thirty
67:58 seven thousand miles away at its average
68:01 distance he's seen the detail on the
68:05 moon he's going how could this thing be
68:07 so far away and I get such amazing
68:08 detailed shots of it with just a home
68:10 camera food-for-thought man so I hope
68:17 you're having the same experience I'm
68:19 having that you're starting to open your
68:22 mind more and more and more from all
68:25 these different subjects we cover from
68:26 just how we see information being
68:29 perceived here on local planet Earth to
68:33 how you might perceive us in a matrix
68:36 where nothing matters you know flatters
68:39 people were correct the heliocentric
68:41 globe people were correct because you're
68:43 in a matrix
68:45 you ever wonder how someone can have a
68:47 drastically different opinion than yours
68:49 as if they're living in a completely
68:51 different world of facts for them Lee
68:54 Harvey Oswald did it all but then you
68:57 have the Mandela effect you know so one
69:00 of the commenters posted on YouTube they
69:04 get was some Chicago Tribune or
69:06 something like that Chicago newspaper or
69:07 something like that where several years
69:10 ago they posted a full article about Eli
69:13 Whitney who created the cotton gin who
69:14 was a black guy and it was it was like a
69:16 celebrating Black History Month sort of
69:18 article the guy's white he's her meal
69:22 now he's different is time organic and
69:27 if you fold it back into dreams what if
69:31 the dynamic nature of our dreams where
69:33 you can walk through a door Jim from
69:35 point A in to point B and they go back
69:38 at the point a and it's changed ever so
69:41 slightly what if that is the absolute
69:44 pure nature of our consciousness living
69:47 in a consciousness reality rendering
69:49 engine and this reality for whatever
69:52 reason we're living in the soup of ether
69:54 so it implies more restrictions and more
69:57 constraints on a reality that we we feel
70:01 like we're locked into the real one and
70:02 we go to sleep it's the fake one I don't
70:06 know how we can call dreams fake they
70:08 happen you know there's obviously dream
70:13 clinics say that you dream every single
70:15 night and of course their science is not
70:20 matching observable reality which is you
70:22 know you have all your dreams in a split
70:24 second when you're in REM state and then
70:25 as soon as you go to your Delta and beta
70:27 phases you're you're off into what is it
70:31 the theta stage or something like that
70:32 right you're completely out cold and
70:34 there's your you essentially have a
70:36 flatline and the way cuz I have
70:40 real-time dreams all day long I mean
70:43 every single night I will drink for
70:45 hours I'll wake up sometimes I have to
70:49 go pee sometimes look at my phone and
70:52 use if I look at my phone I'm disturbing
70:54 and destroying the dream but if I just
70:56 have to go up and go the restroom for a
70:57 split second come back in
70:59 dream yeah right back into the reality
71:01 right where I was and our passes in the
71:03 dream feels like an arrow wake up an
71:05 hours gone in fact I know what time it
71:07 is because I will literally go well I
71:09 feel like I was in that dream for about
71:10 an hour and it was about 7:20 when I
71:13 woke up and now it's 8:20 boom there's a
71:18 lot of humans that can wake up on the
71:21 exact time that they need to wake up to
71:23 go to work they never set an alarm how
71:27 are they able to do that there's a
71:29 little autistic processor in the
71:31 background watching the clock
71:33 something's going on but in closing let
71:37 me just throw out to you this little
71:38 analogy probably not an analogy sorry
71:43 it's it's more of an example of what may
71:45 be the dream clinics are seeing so what
71:50 do they see you go into REM state and if
71:53 you look at the eyelids of the person in
71:55 room state their eyes are swimming
71:56 underneath their eyelids I've seen this
71:58 happen with plenty of girl friends of
71:59 mine okay
72:02 and then they say your brain waves go
72:05 pretty flat and they measure the
72:09 brainwave and that's where they get
72:10 theta and Delta and and that's where you
72:12 start to they study how you feel when
72:15 you wake up and they say oh these people
72:16 who get down into that that deeper state
72:19 of consciousness they seem to wake up
72:21 feeling like they stayed in a motel in
72:22 Wright hotel in Holiday Inn whatever it
72:25 is all right what if we are traveling
72:33 from point A to point B this reality to
72:36 the other reality the rim state is
72:38 merely the doorjamb you are
72:42 transitioning through the Twilight Zone
72:44 into your dream state your eyeballs are
72:47 something like crazy because you are I
72:49 mean why would our eyeballs swim that's
72:51 the weirdest thing why do they swim do
72:53 we sit around swimming our eyeballs in
72:55 this reality no what would that actually
72:57 do if your eyeballs were moving around
72:59 really fast it would impair your vision
73:01 well there's a big difference when
73:02 you're dreaming you're not using your
73:04 eyeballs anymore are you if anything
73:07 you're crawling through your pineal
73:08 gland out into their universe to have a
73:10 good time
73:12 perhaps the moment that our eyes go
73:14 still and our body in this world goes
73:17 into Delta or theta d-theta is the
73:21 correct deep state
73:23 I apologize ever that wrong it's been a
73:25 while since I studied that but it's us
73:29 leaving and we're simply out there and
73:33 our bodies are in super deep sleep
73:35 because the consciousness is no longer
73:36 there burdening it with function it's in
73:40 its autonomic phase
73:42 it's simply sleeping people who take the
73:46 dream molecule DMT they will often their
73:50 body here on earth goes into that sort
73:52 of bath salt feral state where they
73:56 there some of people freaked out you've
73:58 seen these shots and they freaked out
74:01 and they're spazzing all over their
74:04 their living rooms or what-have-you and
74:06 it could be that because DMT allows you
74:10 to inject yourself into the universe
74:12 just like a dream it's a real place you
74:17 always meet the same people I mean it's
74:18 very interesting DMT trips I've never
74:20 taken one but man the descriptions are
74:22 phenomenal see my other episodes for
74:25 that I seriously believe they have left
74:28 their bodies and their bodies are merely
74:31 in an autonomic phase where pure
74:33 instinct is trying to make sense of
74:34 reality but because consciousness is
74:36 such a huge part of this combination
74:41 between your soul in your body which
74:42 forges the mind into existence the mind
74:45 is all of a sudden left deflated and you
74:49 are in pure cavemen feral state bath
74:54 salts same thing who knows what's going
74:58 on when you take bath salts Jesus don't
74:59 ever do that but you see these videos
75:03 all over the web where people say
75:05 zombies really exist and these poor
75:06 police precincts are having to deal with
75:08 these kids who have taken horrible drugs
75:11 they've they've snorted whippets they've
75:15 done all kinds of stuff to just shut
75:16 their brain off and they're sitting
75:18 there trying to walk trying to talk
75:22 they're rolling around the ground there
75:25 just growling like animals it's a horrid
75:31 concept to be stuck in such a state
75:36 wouldn't it anyway thank you feel me
75:42 it's a Tuesday morning really early it's
75:46 about 2:00 2:15 in the morning your
75:50 other update is that tomorrow for
75:51 California is going to be the coldest
75:53 day we're gonna have all month it might
75:55 be the last coldest day before winter
75:59 comes gonna be really low 60s so the
76:01 wind's blowing right now assuring in
76:03 that cold air so I'm gonna get inside
76:06 get warm
76:08 anyhow if you haven't been to deep
76:10 thoughts radio.com there's a few things
76:12 up that I've been forgetting to mention
76:13 this other links on the website so
76:16 obviously for those of you heard this a
76:18 million times you for coming to me on
76:21 YouTube you can put it in podcast listen
76:23 to it in your car when you're walking
76:25 around when you're at work just go up
76:27 there and you can get the other link to
76:28 the RSS feed there's a link to the LOC
76:31 Facebook group I just mentioned there's
76:33 a Twitter account in case you'd like to
76:35 get your feet that way and there's a
76:37 patreon page but there's a new link up
76:38 there that's for the new season one
76:40 channel and the reason why I created a
76:43 separate channel is that I don't want to
76:45 have a hundred videos randomly dropping
76:47 throughout the month a couple months
76:49 it's going to take me to do this that
76:51 are all one through a hundred so what's
76:53 gonna be is that one 300 is being
76:55 remastered for those of you don't know
76:59 what I'm doing the reason why is that
77:00 the the audio levels were all over the
77:03 place in season one I used a lot of
77:06 proprietary you know music from my my
77:10 iTunes you know like all kinds of rock
77:13 and roll songs and all kinds of wild
77:15 songs that happen to match the theme
77:16 that I'm covering the problem is is that
77:18 got the videos banned in Europe and
77:21 banned on mobile devices and all kinds
77:23 of other stupid banning they do 15
77:25 seconds of a song they think they own my
77:26 home video love to see that case in
77:29 court
77:30 so I'm stripping all that out so every
77:33 once in a while at the very beginning of
77:34 a video you'll hear a little bit of
77:35 other music that's because that's the
77:37 remnant coming through
77:38 talking on top of it unfortunately
77:39 because I cross-faded it so I'm taking
77:43 the bumper off the end because a lot of
77:45 the bumpers used to say M Kilcher radio
77:48 that's now all been that will be all
77:50 removed I'm sitting every sound track
77:53 through audition in Adobe I'm balancing
77:56 the vocal levels I'm raising the vocal
77:59 levels to match the music about a new
78:02 opening soundtrack and closing
78:03 soundtrack for the series so I'm also
78:06 taking out all of the pauses all of
78:08 those cigar drags throat clearing if I
78:11 can find it and throwing them back out
78:14 there I'm not watching them all the way
78:15 through I'm just doing a really quick
78:17 cleanup and I'm also dating all of them
78:20 on the front because they're being
78:22 debuted the say someone finds that
78:24 channel and it's like what the hell it
78:26 tells them look the scissor on this date
78:29 in that date so you find out I was
78:32 making tons of episodes day after day
78:34 after day kind of like I'm doing right
78:35 now at night so anyway hope you dug the
78:39 episode take care of yourself and
78:41 someone else and I'll see in the next
78:42 episode over now
