00:00 [Music]
00:32 as I bite the tip off this Herrera
00:36 Esteli busto Grande it's about 3:15 in
00:44 the morning just finished working my
00:48 butt off learning some new stuff and you
00:52 know it just occurs that I have to
00:55 record something this was been on my
00:58 list for a long time and I actually had
01:00 written it in so early it was really far
01:02 down in the list and so I used the
01:04 product Munda list this was gonna be
01:07 about determinism the very first time I
01:11 heard about determinism probably you
01:15 know it's just because of my age it's
01:16 been around for a very long time was in
01:20 the belief Stephen Hawking's book a
01:22 brief history in time which is the book
01:23 I can never remember during these
01:25 episodes because I always think of black
01:29 holes and baby universes I think which
01:31 was a second book and that book was way
01:34 more interesting to me because it wasn't
01:36 built for my grandmother it talked about
01:38 spin one particles and pretty much
01:41 everything that either is made out of
01:42 without ever mentioning ether which is
01:44 sort of funny determinism I think I have
01:48 some sympathy for why people believe in
01:50 it and they're usually scientists who
01:52 then postulated and then philosophers
01:56 get a hold of it and then normal people
01:59 get a hold of it that's usually the
02:00 ecosystem how of how determinism comes
02:03 about and because there's a logical path
02:09 to how scientists talk about this and so
02:14 then equally brilliant people who are
02:16 philosophers pick up on this and
02:19 especially scientists and philosophers
02:22 and people that were abused by a
02:25 religious institution they love to stick
02:28 their finger up at religious people it's
02:30 really interesting back to the church
02:32 not to religious people probably more to
02:34 the church and they understand that as
02:37 well George Carlin was a very brilliant
02:38 man but he was
02:40 raised in a Catholic school who left him
02:43 scarred beyond measure and so he took a
02:47 very a theists route in his belief
02:50 systems merely to again D sanctify the
02:55 institution that was supposed to be an
02:57 institution where he would be safe
02:59 felt welcomed and loved it is the Church
03:02 of God and he felt anything but that I'm
03:06 assuming but determinism initially
03:09 spawns out of this notion that
03:10 everything has an equal and opposite
03:13 reaction and so therefore the universe
03:15 is predetermined mathematically from
03:19 especially their [ __ ] theory of a
03:21 Big Bang I debate covering the Big Bang
03:25 again maybe we can do a little footnote
03:27 and for those of you who haven't
03:30 explained it yet to your friends even
03:32 though you've seen shows and like oh
03:33 yeah there's that thing he says please
03:35 say this to your friends especially
03:37 scientists because it's absolutely
03:39 hilarious to watch their their brain
03:42 implode when they finally realize
03:44 they've been completely strung along
03:45 through that theory the Big Bang Theory
03:49 is that all the well first and foremost
03:51 they get rid of ether which allows them
03:54 to say mystically reverse what gravity
03:57 is it's a pull and not a push right
04:00 gravity is a push just like water on a
04:02 bubble that's how planets exist that are
04:04 around in moons and stars and all that
04:06 stuff right I apologize to my other
04:08 listeners again Aparna matrix who gives
04:11 a [ __ ] but whatever when you have a
04:14 singularity in their theory okay where
04:17 the it masses exchanging information you
04:20 know clear across the universe it can
04:21 pull on something because they've got
04:23 this magic stuff which is why it's still
04:24 a phenomenon and natural phenomenon and
04:27 we could McKee Wikipedia was it
04:29 WikiLeaks WikiLeaks reveal ether but
04:33 that's complete nonsense it's complete
04:35 nonsense they have no theory of how
04:36 gravity works which is why it doesn't
04:38 it's not it's not a pullet to push a
04:41 push doesn't need to exchange
04:43 information between mass it just simply
04:45 bumps into each other just like water
04:47 and you get currents which then go in
04:49 three dimensional spheres and you get
04:51 all of the atomic mass that is
04:53 the universe these little spheres get
04:56 all connected to each other build higher
04:57 constructs which you might call quarks
04:59 and atoms etc it's very logical it's
05:01 very easy to understand but we'll skip
05:03 that for now but this BIGBANG thing is
05:06 that everything comes together into a
05:10 singularity right the single point in
05:11 space now physics completely breaks down
05:13 there
05:14 [ __ ] theories of how everything
05:15 works completely breaks down before the
05:18 explosion occurs but you're supposed to
05:19 overlook that and you're never supposed
05:20 to be told that just like people will
05:22 tell you Christ existed but then they
05:24 lie to you about evidence that he
05:26 existed and then everything is exactly
05:28 the opposite of course there wasn't a
05:29 magic man walking on water and doing all
05:31 these crazy things that no one can do
05:34 today and God simply forsaken us to the
05:36 saint mystic you know globalists that
05:38 are running the world now I don't think
05:40 God works like that thank you we're
05:41 gonna get into this the thing is if you
05:44 had all the mass and universe down to a
05:46 singularity and it exploded then the
05:48 right half of the universe would look
05:49 exactly the same as the left the top of
05:51 look just like the bottom everything
05:52 would distribute absolutely perfectly
05:54 even because the singularity cannot be
05:56 cannot have irregularities it cannot
06:00 have an air bubble you can't have a wart
06:02 on one side and not a word on the other
06:04 side it divot on the other side right so
06:06 we have a chaotic universe when we look
06:07 at the Stars they're not symmetrical
06:09 they're not evenly distributed and as
06:13 Stephen Wolfram proved in a mathematic
06:16 other product he created you have to
06:18 have three to four unique particles in
06:20 the universe and then you get full chaos
06:22 and therefore life I think that's how
06:27 God rules I think all he's doing is
06:28 looking at the fingerprints of God but
06:31 the Big Bang doesn't work and then they
06:33 they started studying the Big Bang
06:35 Theory and realized there wasn't enough
06:36 mass even with their [ __ ] theories
06:39 to account for the level of the
06:41 explosion that occurred and so they
06:42 later invented dark matter which was was
06:48 forged into science by taking a big
06:52 picture of space and turning up a camera
06:54 to - since various infrared signals
06:58 coming from space the heat from space
07:00 and saying there look there's all the
07:02 dark matter one [ __ ] lie on top of
07:04 another [ __ ] lie gives you
07:07 this Big Bang model don't fall for it
07:09 anyone who wants to call themselves a
07:11 scientist and intellectual who believes
07:13 in the Big Bang has absolutely removed
07:16 all doubt that they are not qualified to
07:18 make such deductions okay there you go
07:22 I mention that because that's the basis
07:26 of determinism now determinism could
07:29 still happen an ether all universe I
07:30 guess we're gonna go a different route
07:33 here because I think we on deep thoughts
07:35 know that it doesn't work like that
07:39 Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the
07:41 galaxy mention that book all the time
07:42 I've mentioned this once before he did a
07:46 funny take on determinism using a piece
07:49 of fairy cake and he had a scientist who
07:54 was able to use a single piece of fairy
07:55 cake which I don't know if that existed
07:58 in Britain I know that some sort of cake
07:59 like we have angel flew cake in the
08:00 United States about a no fairy cake
08:03 something real but anyway he said that
08:05 by taking that putting it in this
08:06 particular machine he was able to
08:09 deconstruct the entire history or Rakesh
08:12 construct the entire history of the
08:13 universe from a single slice of fairy
08:16 cake by by going backwards on all the
08:19 atoms and figuring out what made the
08:21 piece of fairy cake exist in the first
08:22 place and then he was able to create the
08:24 in probability drive which could take
08:27 you anywhere in the universe in a single
08:28 second because you would become one with
08:31 the universe as you turn it on and you
08:32 simply choose where to where and what
08:35 time to be in when you pop out
08:38 absolutely hilarious and of course the
08:41 scientists then realized that one thing
08:43 they didn't like was a smartass and they
08:45 lynched the guy in the next gathering
08:48 that's quoting from the book let's look
08:52 at the psychological
08:53 sort of motivators as to why man would
08:56 choose determinism versus self created
09:02 destinies right there's a mathematical
09:05 model there this simply says because
09:09 everything is here and it is
09:11 mathematical regardless of the big bang
09:13 exists then everything that I'm going to
09:15 think and feel everything that
09:18 everyone's going to say to me
09:20 whether they like me or reject me they
09:23 are going to do it based on this
09:25 predetermined calculation that is all
09:28 mass and energy in the universe which is
09:30 obviously the same thing so I'll you
09:31 throw particles okay but that's if we're
09:38 a bag of chemicals a kurtz well
09:42 primitive shape and a 3d product were a
09:45 cube that's all we are right we're just
09:48 a bunch of chemicals we have these tubes
09:50 in our brains we have no idea how it
09:52 works
09:52 sure yeah you can injure the vessel and
09:55 cause all kinds of things to occur in
09:57 the mind as I've said several times on
09:59 the show okay what I find absolutely
10:04 ironic about the determinism belief is
10:08 that if you look at my existential
10:10 episode one of the first things I start
10:12 out with the hook and the episode is I
10:13 say to you what if the greatest secret
10:15 about the universe is that we control it
10:19 we made it we designed it our Creator
10:24 designed it our sustainer designed it
10:26 it's either us or him those are the two
10:30 things and we simply are we are the is
10:35 we are the plural of the telic I the
10:39 imaginary number the plural of imaginary
10:43 I is I s is okay what does someone do to
10:52 adopt this sort of feudalistic
10:55 determinism thing where they surrender
10:58 their whole life to determinism there is
11:00 no such thing as fate there's no such
11:02 thing as destiny
11:03 you simply have been determined to exist
11:06 as the universe exploded your DNA was
11:10 pre-selected by all the collisions that
11:13 were going to occur it is their adoption
11:16 and their surrendering of their
11:18 sovereign powers to control their life
11:19 that makes them someone who believes and
11:23 and lives by the doctrine of determinism
11:25 you sit there as a scientist and you pat
11:29 yourself on the back for having come up
11:31 with this theory or having
11:33 understood it and adopted it and so
11:35 therefore you participate less in your
11:37 life because it's all determined a
11:40 philosopher who then picks it up picks
11:42 up the baton and carries it into the
11:44 lexicon of the mind games of human
11:48 development tell you not to worry it's
11:50 all been determined and then someone
11:53 reads that philosopher and for whatever
11:55 reason that particular philosopher
11:57 Thaksin way that they completely
11:58 understand it fluently and they adopt it
12:00 they surrender their control hmm but
12:05 what if God built us what if we design
12:07 ourselves to have a complete level of
12:11 control over this universe you do
12:13 control your life you do use frequencies
12:16 of thoughts to win a lottery to get the
12:20 best job to find the best mate to have
12:23 healthy kids you infect your kids with
12:26 your optimism even if you're going
12:28 through the depression and they live a
12:31 better life they don't see or it bunch
12:35 this way they see the flowers they smell
12:38 the roses in the midst of chaos they're
12:42 a lot more secure and sound with
12:44 themselves but then someone comes along
12:47 and you know we're going to analyze you
12:49 might want this sort of thing who might
12:51 benefit from this I guarantee you the
12:55 globalists of the world every single one
12:58 of every monarch every banker every dick
13:02 it serves either one of these people
13:06 they don't believe it oh they don't
13:10 believe it at all their philosophy is
13:12 complete and utter control and if they
13:14 did believe in it for even a split
13:16 second they would think that they are
13:17 they are ordained by the universe to
13:20 control you Oh
13:22 hubris ain't enough of a word man I have
13:27 had this experience and again I'm
13:30 plagiarizing myself but at least it's
13:33 200 episodes ago because it's important
13:36 to bring together our observable reality
13:39 that will throw a monkey wrench into the
13:44 theory of determinism in my opinion
13:47 now someone could take the take the tact
13:49 that all I'm doing is seeing the future
13:51 I guess which is pretty [ __ ] cool but
13:54 I have a buddy of mine that I grew up
13:57 with from the age of 18 and up because
14:00 he was here in California he was 17 he
14:02 just won your ear younger than me
14:03 this guy could jump off the World Trade
14:08 Centers and somehow he's gonna land on
14:11 his feet he's gonna be okay no parachute
14:15 he could jump from 30,000 feet somehow
14:16 he's gonna live because he's so
14:18 optimistic about life he manhandles life
14:22 it is crazy what this guy can do always
14:26 finds a great job and he's nine you know
14:29 it's like he's an absolutely brilliant
14:31 guy but the just the style of which he
14:34 does it allows him to do the same thing
14:36 other people do better it's just amazing
14:39 but in this guy's company as a matter of
14:42 fact that's unrelated to his particular
14:44 talents for being optimistic we used to
14:46 roleplay together
14:47 now when I was a kid I always wanted to
14:49 role play D&D but I was a only child and
14:52 for whatever reason the camp's that I
14:54 hung out with there weren't enough nerds
14:56 to do it in or I wasn't I didn't know
14:58 that they did it or whatever so I didn't
15:00 play Dungeons & Dragons until I was
15:03 probably 23 24 years old and I'll go
15:07 quicker on this since it might be a
15:09 recap for some of you but we're real
15:11 playing a particular game for six months
15:13 and there was a situation where our
15:16 characters and by the way my Dungeon
15:18 Master was you know one of the most
15:21 talented game designers I've ever met so
15:24 when he was our guide it was sick how
15:28 amazingly good this guy was and he acted
15:31 out all the characters and he was a
15:33 super he's a ladies man he wasn't some
15:35 total geek just a really cool guy so he
15:40 is able to describe things like a
15:43 Tolkien novel but he was able to do it
15:45 quickly let's put that way so he gets as
15:49 we go down in this cave and where we
15:51 find this amazing cavern in there and
15:54 it's being lit by this glowing moss
15:56 which is how we could see what we were
15:57 doing and there was a river that went
15:59 right down the center of it
16:00 and but there's like little chambers
16:02 that people had dug out you know to live
16:04 and there were some elves that were
16:07 living down there in particular what
16:09 else and my character was a wood elf I
16:11 had never really seen another wood elf
16:13 and but there was some ogres that got
16:16 down there and rated the place and they
16:19 were just in front of us
16:20 they were just far enough down we
16:21 couldn't see him but we kept finding the
16:23 carnage of their raping and pillaging
16:26 and we got to this first village and we
16:30 noticed the place is ransacked so we're
16:31 looking all this carnage and we went it
16:33 I went into one of the taverns and I'm
16:35 looking down at the ground and II
16:37 there's a beautiful female wood elf and
16:40 what else have tattoos and they're a
16:42 little more you know stout more athletic
16:44 looking he tells me that she had been
16:48 raped and it was very very very graphic
16:53 and it we're playing this game for six
16:59 hours I don't know if you ever played
17:00 this game before you get pizzas you play
17:01 music we used to play Conan the
17:03 Barbarian soundtrack in the background
17:05 looped really quiet which really set the
17:07 scene and so I'm a writer and so I'm
17:10 like totally into this thing but he
17:12 described it so vividly and everyone in
17:15 the room is in the frequency of making
17:16 this fictional story a reality we get
17:20 back in the boat we're gonna go after
17:21 these [ __ ] free so we sailed down
17:23 and sure enough the next opening on the
17:25 right side the other thing was on the
17:26 left side was this huge opening like a
17:29 natural cavern opening and there's just
17:31 hundreds at wargs in there are ogres or
17:34 whatever they are orcs I think but
17:35 anyway I look over and we see this just
17:40 a bunch of them and one of the dudes is
17:42 sitting on the throne and he played it
17:46 like you know it was like those dog
17:49 characters in fifth element where if you
17:52 knock out the commander the other guys
17:54 don't know what to do it was uh it was
17:57 korben Dallas negotiate he shouldn't act
17:59 it great but so he explains it if you
18:02 kill that guy you're gonna be able to
18:04 wipe out all these other soldiers and so
18:08 obviously I see him as responsible for
18:10 this girl
18:10 my first female wood elf I've seen since
18:13 I was a kid
18:14 and you know just there's that little
18:16 bit of chivalry that's got a protective
18:18 you know that the honor of a woman who's
18:20 been destroyed by these [ __ ] and so
18:23 I like I like being a little um chaotic
18:28 when I play and so I might dude it's
18:30 huge man we rolled those dice for I
18:32 don't know how many hours trying to find
18:34 the right stance which is sort of
18:35 cheating but we did it fairly and so I
18:39 jump off the singing I go I'm going
18:40 after him he was what and I'm running
18:42 right after him he's like okay and I had
18:49 to do a couple saving throws to get to
18:50 him but I did and the way that D&D
18:52 worked is you had this big-ass died had
18:54 twenty sides on it
18:55 if you'd uh if you threw one you dropped
18:57 your weapon you could even break it hit
18:59 the wall saving will to see if you break
19:01 your weapon it's such a bad spazzy thing
19:03 but if you roll a twenty not only do you
19:05 hit whatever you're trying to hit but
19:06 you hit four double damage so whatever
19:08 you roll next for your damage is what
19:10 you get but here's the thing
19:13 I was gonna kill this guy I was gonna
19:16 kill this guy
19:17 because of what he did and so I run up
19:21 to him and then they go okay roll and I
19:25 grabbed this 20-sided die this happened
19:27 twice playing with these dudes and I am
19:30 shaking this die and my mind is so
19:34 furious about this fictional story that
19:36 he just told me that I'm rolling this
19:40 thing in the whole universe and I mean
19:43 this happened to me twice okay this is
19:44 not like a joke it built this bubble
19:49 around me of glass that had refraction
19:52 and everything and I am all of a sudden
19:56 in this moment and my confidence in my
19:58 chest for controlling the universe was a
20:03 thousand percent I mean had I said I'm
20:07 gonna pull a lottery ticket out of my
20:08 ass it would have happened you know you
20:10 may should try that pick a different
20:12 location but anyway I'm rolling as day
20:14 and I had this feeling this amazing
20:16 feeling like I am doing this it's going
20:18 to occur and I look at my buddy and I'm
20:20 almost like in a sort of funny state of
20:24 I don't think it's panic but it was like
20:27 oh my
20:27 god I was like surprised and I said look
20:29 I am this is gonna be a 20 this is a 20
20:32 boom threw it down 20 just cut the guy
20:36 in half I rolled massive damage cut the
20:38 dude in half we wiped all these guys out
20:40 into that chapter this happened one
20:43 other time but I did this and I looked
20:45 at my buddy after it was over and you
20:47 know me I wasn't much different
20:49 philosophically and determined wise in
20:52 terms of my being honest and
20:54 communicating thing when I was 24 and I
20:57 said dudes I just controlled the day my
21:01 buddies look at me and they go yeah you
21:02 can do that the more you play you'll
21:04 find out you can do that it just happens
21:06 and they just blew it off it only
21:08 happened to be twice at the exact same
21:11 feeling both times and it was the only
21:13 two times in my life but I said I am
21:16 going to roll a 20 now every time you
21:19 roll you say come on give me a 20 when
21:22 you do Yahtzee come on gimme Yahtzee but
21:27 with the story connected to my soul you
21:31 can control it and I'm looking at the
21:34 guy who's the one that controls his
21:36 whole life he does this every day okay
21:41 and so I you know later had the
21:46 conversation with him I pulled him aside
21:47 again I said look are you serious about
21:49 this controlling the die thing because
21:51 I'm telling you man I had a whole extra
21:53 thing that happened to me this this
21:55 thing wrapped around me it wasn't normal
21:57 I hadn't we don't drink alcohol at all
22:00 we don't do drugs
22:02 and so they said ya know it happens and
22:05 I took my other friend aside at a whole
22:08 different looking time in place and I
22:09 said dude tell me about this and he goes
22:10 yeah it doesn't happen very often but
22:12 when the story is really good that's
22:14 when it happens okay so what's the
22:18 difference between this fictional moment
22:21 where I pull a 20 and life itself well
22:27 if you ever been in a fight before the
22:30 same [ __ ] happens same thing happens
22:33 doesn't matter how big the guy is if you
22:35 have that conviction in your heart it's
22:38 what mike tyson always did he just
22:40 simply said I see you
22:41 falling all these great boxers out there
22:43 they see the other guy falling and the
22:45 guy is a little insecure at the little
22:47 you know bump they loose now some of
22:50 them are humble and they're mistaken for
22:52 being insecure and they're just like man
22:54 I'm sorry I'm gonna I'm gonna knock you
22:55 out and that that just happens right
22:57 what do they do with athletes they tell
22:59 basketball players it's this full-on
23:01 strategy Hakeem the study released in
23:04 the late 1980s excuse me it was a
23:07 psychology magazine but it might have
23:08 been an awning magazine before that a
23:10 long long gone magazine but they were
23:13 teaching people to sit and envision
23:15 free-throws going in the basket
23:18 totally envision the whole thing that
23:19 you know the flop move and then when
23:22 they go practice they were way better
23:24 and so now it is a it is a technique
23:28 that professional basketball players are
23:30 expected to do you're expected to
23:32 meditate on your free throws and you can
23:34 tell the guys who do and tell the guys
23:35 that don't I've seen probably three
23:37 interviews where the guy said you know
23:40 they were getting complimented by the
23:41 press for being really good players that
23:44 day and they said well you know I I did
23:45 my my meditation on my three for my free
23:49 throws and that's why I did really well
23:52 tonight mm-hmm confidence confidence by
23:58 creating artificial I guess visions of
24:02 the experience going the way they wanted
24:04 it to go
24:05 so tell me all about determinism why
24:08 don't you know what would be the inverse
24:12 of determinism because determinism is
24:13 pretty easy you just give up on life
24:16 amen
24:17 if you're a loser that's because the
24:19 universe built you to be a loser if
24:21 you're a winner well you're just a
24:23 winner because the universe built you to
24:25 be a winner
24:26 we all know people that fall uphill all
24:29 the time hey sometimes that can happen
24:32 because you are a ball in a pinball
24:34 machine if you don't take care of your
24:36 life you're getting hit by the bumpers
24:38 and the kickers and all that stuff right
24:40 the flippers but once you go I don't
24:42 think I'm gonna allow you to flip me
24:44 today and that bumper or that flipper
24:47 goes out you and you just stay there and
24:48 you're like no your laws of gravity
24:51 don't apply to me dude and then you
24:54 start owning your life and it's pretty
24:55 frickin awesome let me tell you
24:58 globalism is supposed to gut you it's
25:03 supposed to get your confidence it's
25:07 supposed to leave you docile which means
25:09 weak to your controllers you're supposed
25:12 to believe the indoctrination that you
25:14 have controllers that's what you're
25:16 supposed to do if you do what they say
25:21 now do we want full-blown chaos in the
25:24 universe no of course not one of the
25:28 things that occurs way too often in
25:30 conversation and I mentioned this a long
25:32 long time ago is what I call the
25:34 extremists point of view to win an
25:36 argument I believe I first debut this in
25:40 the thought police episode which is when
25:42 you talk about political correctness I
25:44 have a family member that does this all
25:46 the time and it's a very weak minded
25:48 thing to do you say look we can't have
25:51 all of these words being demonized that
25:55 especially in some cases are purely
25:56 scientific words that are never used by
26:00 some people in any contextual way the
26:03 the way that the the slander is supposed
26:06 to work how many times people go that's
26:08 so gay and so gay no one's thinking
26:11 about a homosexual person okay they're
26:14 simply saying that's stupid okay
26:17 hey if you want to take that wording and
26:19 use that word to describe yourself later
26:22 on for some other thing it means happy
26:23 that's all it means right if you watch
26:26 it what's my line they will say I mean
26:28 watch anything made before or like 1960
26:31 the word gay is used all the time is
26:33 happy but somebody started probably a
26:37 heterosexual person and started using it
26:38 against an almost sexual person and then
26:40 it became their word okay
26:43 absurd you can't own a word I don't give
26:46 a [ __ ] if you got 50 million people
26:47 together and go we own this word you
26:49 don't own it
26:49 sorry I can use it if I want to as long
26:52 as I don't use it against you in a
26:54 derogatory manner in fact you know it's
26:59 funny we do say that behaviors when when
27:02 a guy is especially when a guy is
27:04 straight and he starts acting you know
27:06 like weak when he should nut up and only
27:09 [ __ ] right maybe and that's an extreme
27:12 circumstance where the word gay might be
27:14 used against the heterosexual guy but
27:15 ninety nine point nine times out of
27:17 history we say gay for an inanimate
27:20 object or some opinion about something a
27:23 movie some stupid strategy or something
27:27 okay when you start to choose your
27:33 reality it's an interesting thing
27:36 because someone has to tell you that
27:37 that's possible
27:39 now there's two ways to choose your
27:41 reality and you should probably use both
27:43 techniques one is what I've been talking
27:45 about a lot which is planning your life
27:47 plan it because if you don't plan it it
27:50 can't happen you know it's like my buddy
27:52 wanted a thousand dollars a month I said
27:54 look the fact that you even recognize
27:55 that you needed a thousand dollars a
27:56 month means you have your difficulty and
28:00 once you start trying to get the
28:01 thousand dollars you keep having and
28:03 having and having until what a thousand
28:05 bucks is in your hand
28:06 good deal hopefully you found a
28:09 mechanism that is a monthly thing that
28:11 you've now crushed the problem and now
28:13 you can just get this thousand bucks by
28:15 offering some service and product or
28:16 whatever and you're good okay the other
28:20 mechanism that is used and it's the one
28:24 I grew up with prior to any science is
28:26 talking about it but I never really
28:27 paint it much much mind is the book of
28:31 life theory of determinism this would
28:34 come up in the Midwest when someone
28:36 would die who was young and they would
28:39 say well this is this is the way God
28:40 wrote it in the book of life if God you
28:43 know wanted your kid to die because
28:46 you're gonna have this experience and of
28:47 course your kids fine with God and it's
28:50 um hmm not sure not sure about that one
28:54 I think that the circumstances of life
28:58 come together where we're sitting in
29:00 this giant supercomputer that is but the
29:04 amalgamation of all of our choices
29:06 coming together talk about infinite
29:09 combinations so let's think about that
29:15 we get influenced just like the
29:18 butterfly in Peru changes the cost of T
29:21 inch
29:22 No all right aren't they coastal regions
29:27 facing each other right so what about
29:30 that whole thing that we talk about all
29:32 the time let's say that we accept the
29:35 fact that we can control reality because
29:37 it's just simply the gift that we give
29:38 ourselves we don't want to nullify our
29:42 participation in the universe as
29:43 creators if God made us in his own image
29:46 and he made us exclusively then he's a
29:51 creator and he gives us a little bit of
29:54 creation power over all we know women
29:57 make babies and they need men men to
29:59 help conceive of them
30:00 there's creation man builds things I'm
30:05 sending him with all this stuff that man
30:06 bill okay more creationism and there's
30:10 very few limits that we have to create
30:13 things so now we're sitting together and
30:20 we realized that if you're with someone
30:23 that is going to termina's 'm and you're
30:26 going creation or destiny manifest
30:30 destiny I should say so manifest destiny
30:32 is over here determinism is over here we
30:36 believe that you can make things happen
30:37 I told you about the fact I've won
30:39 several contests and lotteries because i
30:42 sat there like raffle ticket kind
30:44 because they sat there and dream that I
30:46 just felt that I could I felt that I was
30:48 gonna win one time I want a lottery
30:50 I was with my buddy with a bunch of
30:52 other people at this big gathering it
30:55 was a big church gathering in Mission
30:57 Viejo and they had this big raffle going
31:00 on well we're doing all these crazy
31:02 things right and he goes well let's go
31:04 over there and do this I said why I
31:06 gotta win this thing first and he was
31:07 what'd he mean it goes I said I just I
31:09 always win these things while I'm saying
31:11 that I call him my name I won top prize
31:14 boom he's looking at me like what the
31:17 hell oh yeah that's oh it works
31:18 you manifest it and it happens so what
31:23 have we been talking about when it comes
31:24 to people that we surround ourselves
31:25 with you surround yourself with bad
31:29 company guess what's gonna happen all
31:33 those bad philosophies all that bad
31:36 victimization thought-process like
31:39 you're always victim I'm always in jail
31:41 I'm always getting arrested by the Popo
31:44 mmm yeah MAME because you constantly
31:47 break the law cause you haven't really
31:48 figured out a good philosophy for your
31:50 life they tell people to go to prison
31:52 all the time you when you get out of
31:53 this joint you can't hang out with the
31:55 same people you hung out with and how
31:57 many times I watch those lockup shows on
32:00 Netflix with a guy totally has his [ __ ]
32:03 together or girl in prison but usually
32:06 it's the guy that ends up in this other
32:07 side story and the guy leaves and he
32:10 gets shanked by someone outside cuz he
32:13 kept hanging out with the wrong crowd
32:15 hmm I just talked to a really good
32:19 friend of mine tonight and a great
32:20 conversation and she's she's one of us
32:23 man she was like totally into Tesla man
32:26 she's brilliant and her whole philosophy
32:30 of life is so refreshing I might have
32:32 her on the show if I can get her here to
32:34 do a show we're gonna talk about some
32:36 really cool things but she is sort of
32:38 dismantling all of the doctor nation I
32:43 always talk about when I say look you
32:45 know in modern day times in 2019 the
32:48 definition of being an adult is closing
32:51 your mind and becoming as indoctrinated
32:53 as possible with your choices that's the
32:56 way life works nowadays it's not like
32:58 the Greek philosophers that went into
33:00 the Universities and utterly blew their
33:02 minds up expanded it man they went in
33:06 with maybe like you know ten cubic feet
33:09 of thinking and came out with an
33:11 infinite spectrum of thinking we don't
33:15 consider that growing up anymore why
33:17 because it's control control control
33:20 except now the dark doctor nation is
33:23 vaccinations and horrible food and
33:26 horrible medical treatments and global
33:29 warming and just lies lies lies lies
33:31 lies all that's about to change people
33:33 let me tell you I just heard a report
33:37 tonight which was utterly utterly
33:39 phenomenal about foreign government
33:43 influence on our press and our
33:46 politicians
33:48 and the president that people hate so
33:53 much well he's gonna be dishing out the
33:57 indictments through his AG and should be
34:00 real interesting man there's a reason
34:03 why he says the press is gonna be out of
34:05 business in six years
34:06 the fake press anyway but now what if I
34:10 set you damn they said look this is the
34:11 deal we're gonna play D&D for however
34:17 many years it takes for you to have the
34:19 experience I had controlling the die
34:21 which every single one of my friends in
34:22 that room had done at least once
34:25 honestly multiple times for them they've
34:28 been playing the game since they were
34:29 nine which is why they were so good at
34:32 it but you're gonna have that experience
34:34 of once you have that experience again
34:38 it's due to a great Dungeon Master
34:40 someone who's telling you the story
34:41 that's amazing it's imperative once you
34:46 have that experience your life changes
34:48 if you went to Disneyland I met well
34:50 your life would change about previous
34:52 lifes and afterlife and all that good
34:54 stuff you would no longer thank you die
34:56 and just that's it you wouldn't you
34:58 couldn't and what's funny is I'll tell
35:00 someone that story and nine times out of
35:02 ten they know what kind of person I am
35:05 and so they go whoa if he's saying that
35:08 it must have really happened I got
35:11 witnesses okay
35:12 so but I'll tell like a family member of
35:15 mine who hasn't really spent that much
35:16 time with me personally they you know
35:18 he'd talk on the phone or whatever and
35:19 you can just hear him on the other side
35:20 of the phone somehow somehow they're
35:23 telling themselves that I'm telling a
35:25 big tall tale and you know part of me is
35:28 like [ __ ] you man if you can't believe
35:30 in me and I'm your own [ __ ] blood
35:31 then go [ __ ] yourself I mean seriously
35:34 that's why your family's not the best
35:36 thing that bounced [ __ ] off of but once
35:40 you figure this out then all of a sudden
35:41 you start looking at determinism one is
35:45 the enemy that it really is but to the
35:48 happy news is it's time to start
35:51 crafting your life now here's the
35:54 interesting thing I'll tell you and it's
35:57 goes something like this
35:59 let's say you want to do something
36:01 extraordinary with your life again it
36:04 could be anything could be anything
36:07 let's use an easy one you want to become
36:10 a really good celebrated chef in your
36:14 local area yet you could do this at any
36:16 age that's the cool thing Gordon
36:18 Ramsay's proved anything it could be a
36:20 great shift at any age you need some
36:23 time to get your craft together but if
36:25 you have that instinct you've probably
36:26 been kind of you know messing around
36:28 with food for a long time but even if
36:30 it's just you know the past couple of
36:32 years you've been noticing you have a
36:33 little instinct for savory and sweet and
36:35 and you can put something together no
36:37 matter what ingredients you have you can
36:38 come up with something really cool I
36:39 mean where do you think they're getting
36:40 all these guests that go on these
36:41 cooking shows it's a real thing all
36:44 right now what's cool about being a chef
36:47 is that it's a real paying job out there
36:49 so you might get a lot more support for
36:51 that particular extraordinary thing then
36:53 versus like me becoming a screenwriter
36:56 it's a lot more difficult people are
36:58 really you know do you have that special
37:00 DNA do we fly the find the well the
37:03 Floridians or whatever the hell was in
37:05 your blood for the force you know they
37:06 want to test you to see if you got that
37:08 special blood because they think that
37:09 those are special human beings that just
37:11 come out of certain uteruses it's really
37:12 funny but what you'll find is in most
37:15 cases there's a lot of doubters around
37:17 you well you know he or she's trying to
37:20 be issued well you know they're doing
37:21 that thing well good luck you know maybe
37:23 and then you get your passive-aggressive
37:26 haters they hate you because they don't
37:30 want you to get anything that they don't
37:32 have they don't want you to have that
37:33 upper mobility and power in your life to
37:36 be able to work anywhere in the world to
37:38 be celebrated for something that they
37:39 have never been celebrated for to that
37:41 extent at least and so maybe that's not
37:43 even your goal but that's how they view
37:45 it and so they take you down and here's
37:48 the thing here's the interesting thing
37:50 about people that want to take you down
37:51 if they're lying to you
37:53 you'll never know that they're the
37:55 reason why you're being infected with
37:58 the really bad frequency their petty
38:03 their ignorant and their immature
38:06 they're probably people that have only
38:08 been born a few times in this universe
38:09 of my opinion at least in the human form
38:12 and then on occasion it's pretty rare
38:15 you might get someone who really lets
38:17 you have it right to your face some
38:19 weird sounds going on in there
38:22 so someone might say well you know it
38:27 used to be if you said you wanted to be
38:30 an actor or a comedian there's all kinds
38:34 of stories it doesn't happen as much
38:35 anymore because people know it's a
38:36 legitimate career and there's a lot of
38:37 paths to get there and so parents can
38:40 even study up on it and go oh I see what
38:42 you're doing you okay well if you want
38:44 to do all those things and dedicate
38:45 yourself you probably could get there
38:46 but it's a lot of competition so be
38:48 careful but there's a lot more
38:50 supportive parents now than there ever
38:51 was back in the day that used to always
38:54 tell these stories well when I tell my
38:56 parents I want to be a comedian they
38:58 [ __ ] all over me when I tell them I want
38:59 to be an actor they [ __ ] all over me
39:01 well he's there right in your face and
39:03 you can just sort of push him out you
39:05 know move away from home you know get
39:07 away from those people you know you
39:08 can't easily become anything that you
39:11 want to be if everyone around you is
39:12 naysaying your dream very important I
39:17 don't know what to think about people
39:19 that are that do that because they're
39:22 pretty easy to find aren't they I'm very
39:25 fortunate in my life right now I have
39:27 managed to filter out those kind of
39:28 folks I had people around me that are
39:31 negative about their own life and maybe
39:33 negative about the world's outcome or
39:35 something like that but I can at least
39:37 easily compartmentalize them in their
39:39 own little container if you are going
39:43 for something or if your life is sort of
39:46 just kind of junky first you need to own
39:49 it yourself you need to sit down with
39:50 yourself and say am i manifesting the
39:53 proper destiny those people that are
39:55 sick all the time are very interesting
39:57 they're sick all the time why because
39:59 they think about being sick all the time
40:01 in the book holographic universe is an
40:04 interesting story about a woman who said
40:06 that she was being attacked by demons
40:08 and her heart and she eventually died of
40:12 some cardiac arrest thing or something
40:14 like that lion-o if she died or not I
40:16 mean I think she died anyway they they
40:19 cut her heart they did open heart
40:21 surgery on her and found out that or
40:23 maybe he's on autopsy I can't remember
40:25 hope she lived anyway they said the
40:28 weird thing was you have a bunch of
40:29 secular doctors looking at this heart
40:31 and they couldn't believe what they saw
40:37 but they said there was a sort of a
40:40 humanoid shape hole in her heart and
40:45 some people could construe it as a demon
40:47 or whatever but I think there was even a
40:49 mission if someone thought it was an
40:50 angel but this woman may have manifested
40:56 this injury on her heart with a
40:58 full-blown humanoid pattern by thinking
41:03 about it and you know there's people
41:06 that are that dedicated to their misery
41:08 to do something like that
41:10 sometimes there's whole families that
41:12 just are depressed all the time and
41:14 they're just everything's bad daddy
41:16 shaking mommy not feeling good no no
41:19 it's like oh my god you know you see him
41:22 all the time on those hoarding shows
41:23 unfortunately just families that are
41:25 busted it's just unbelievable like they
41:28 keep passing down the psychosis not
41:30 their genetics through pure mental
41:32 training to choose the worst second in
41:35 their life the irony about the book of
41:38 life would be something tenth amount to
41:43 confession well why do you have to pay
41:47 you know pray the rosary why do you have
41:50 to do a hell marry I mean I'm talking
41:51 about Catholic things only why would you
41:54 have to ask for forgiveness and all
41:55 these other things if it's all
41:57 predetermined that you're gonna be
41:58 whatever you're gonna be doesn't make
42:02 any sense
42:03 this penal system we have for praying
42:06 off your sins is based on the fact that
42:08 you made a choice and you need to stop
42:11 choosing that choice but if you're on
42:13 Rails like a train on train tracks it
42:17 can't do a left turn if the rail doesn't
42:18 exist there's no injunction that says oh
42:20 yeah you can go this way if you want to
42:22 now probably most of you go your entire
42:25 life's without ever thinking about
42:27 determinism or it hits you ever you know
42:30 10 years yeah there's that whole weird
42:32 thing that's strange what I'm most
42:34 interested in with you guys is to make
42:36 sure that you understand you
42:38 in the universe for yourself you do one
42:43 there the sterile secular view of
42:46 everything you simply have to plan and
42:48 take action to get things to occur we
42:51 know that works because you can plan
42:53 yourself into prison really easily can't
42:55 you go rob a bank and don't get away
42:58 boom you're in jail
43:00 hey like that you determined that for
43:03 yourself guess what even though it's a
43:06 little bit harder you can go get the
43:08 good stuff too
43:09 you just got to know you can do it how's
43:12 it gonna get hard sure probably if
43:14 you've never done it before but have you
43:18 any of you ah here's a good good analogy
43:21 for you guys now I won't have references
43:25 that are millennial based so I'm gonna
43:27 give you sort of a baby boomer
43:30 reference here how many of you familiar
43:34 with Jeff Bridges or Kurt Douglas
43:38 I think Jeff has a brother beau right
43:41 whatever okay or Charlie Sheen and
43:45 Emilio Estevez the brothers machine
43:47 brothers Estevez goes by his original
43:50 name not his movie star name have you
43:53 ever looked at those guys and you said
43:55 well [ __ ] that was easy for those guys
43:57 to become mega stars I mean their
43:59 parents or mega stars maybe it's Mike
44:03 Douglas excuse me Kurt Douglas is the
44:05 father Mike Douglas Kurt Douglas is 102
44:08 unbelievable right but their parents got
44:13 them in the game taught them how it
44:14 works the bridges family and the Douglas
44:18 family did an absolutely phenomenal job
44:20 teaching their sons how to be amazing
44:22 actors amazing Ron Howard's daughters
44:25 are all actors I think all three of them
44:28 I've been in something okay
44:32 so you're sitting there thinking hmm if
44:36 you surround yourself by these people
44:38 that do that thing you can get in that
44:39 thing a lot easier the one it has a
44:41 little bit to do with who you know of
44:43 course if you're pretty it also helps
44:47 musicians how many of you know someone
44:50 who became famous
44:51 in a band but they hung out with you
44:54 know motley crue back in the day when
44:56 they were broke whatever it hain't been
44:59 you can think of they hung out together
45:03 with the same dream that's what helped
45:07 now of course their videos out there as
45:10 a hilarious video out there and I I
45:12 apologize this is a bad thing to to be
45:16 interested about but there was a video
45:18 out there made at the tail end of the
45:20 80s if not the beginning of the 90s and
45:22 it was interviewing a bunch of kids
45:24 trying to become really 80s pop stars or
45:26 80 metal band people and they were
45:29 asking them do you think you're gonna
45:30 succeed they're all like yeah absolutely
45:32 absolutely and you know what they were
45:33 saying the right thing unfortunately for
45:36 them and I don't know where any of these
45:38 people landed except for one guys in
45:39 jail now you knows a buddy of mine a
45:44 quarter of a million dollars maybe they
45:46 changed their game went into grunge and
45:48 figured out a way to make that band work
45:49 Alanis Morissette was dancing in
45:51 triangles doing pop music from Canada
45:54 supposedly a rich kid she reinvented
45:57 herself as the grunge icon the female
45:59 grunge icon of the 90s right there you
46:03 go she owned her destiny she'd just sit
46:06 around go oh man pop music's over you
46:08 know dressing up like dr. Dre in the 80s
46:10 is not not gonna happen anymore
46:12 dr. Dre dressed in you know polyester
46:16 suits and was in you know half the you
46:20 know he was in little local bands here
46:22 in South Central as a DJ and he changed
46:25 his game he got an NWA he went from
46:27 softer heart and he blew up okay I mean
46:34 how many times have you seen someone
46:36 succeed where you look at the person and
46:39 you're like wow that dude succeeded in
46:41 that how many people looked at Eminem
46:44 and and you really thought oh well of
46:46 course that kid's gonna succeed in rap
46:48 nobody did he's this kind of awkward
46:52 looking white guy who was you know
46:55 terribly scrawny but plays like he's
46:57 some big [ __ ] you know juggernaut or
46:59 something he's totally involved with all
47:01 this little lead island crap it's gonna
47:02 be hilarious when it goes down
47:04 but he hunkered down he's gonna no
47:07 nowhere right he's on the 8-mile strip
47:10 didn't come from a rich family he
47:12 wrapped all about that as a mother that
47:14 hopefully is doing better today but he
47:16 had a big problem with her back and they
47:17 had a problem his ex-wife back in the
47:19 day okay
47:20 well love him or hate him he succeeded
47:23 and he succeeded why super duper mega
47:26 hardwork was a little black kid never
47:30 got taller than five three in
47:31 Minneapolis Minnesota he's pretty
47:34 handsome but you know he's short didn't
47:38 have any money
47:40 he became Prince absolute star of the
47:45 stars man mega huge he didn't have Joe
47:49 Jackson breathing down his back and four
47:51 other brothers playing the instruments
47:53 for him you know of anybody playing
47:55 history instruments for him he had to
47:57 write his own music and make it happen
47:59 what if that dude sat in a basement
48:02 being grounded next to a piano and just
48:06 said well I even learned this thing it's
48:07 determined and it's determined for me
48:09 I'm gonna be a poor black kid in
48:12 Minneapolis Minnesota that's it
48:14 aim whatever how many people have
48:17 influenced your life that never took
48:19 that attitude they owned it how many
48:23 people survived war because they tried
48:25 they were in the thick of war and they
48:29 survived and you're probably the biggest
48:32 metaphor is actual physical war war
48:34 military war but there's probably a ton
48:36 of wars people fight all the time that
48:38 are simply you know domestic wars with
48:41 their parents with their families
48:44 there's this big debate whether or not
48:46 we're all made equal I got a close
48:50 friend of mine he's really brilliant
48:51 east as we and all equal men and you
48:55 feel that way when you deal with society
48:57 because people make poor choices and
49:00 most people make poor choices because
49:02 they're what they're completely
49:03 surrounded and completely indoctrinated
49:05 by who the globalists okay that is why
49:11 that's occurring but what is the fuel
49:14 I'm gonna go into this just a little bit
49:16 deeper here
49:17 what's the fuel of being gullible to the
49:19 globalists what catalyzes that event one
49:24 being trustworthy being trusting of
49:27 other people I should say you are
49:29 trustworthy you trust other people so if
49:32 you grew up in a good community around
49:34 good people who trust people
49:35 guess what Hillary Clinton shows up and
49:39 you're gonna get lied to Algor shows up
49:42 you're gonna be lied to
49:43 Obama shows up you're gonna be lied to
49:47 they're gonna tell what you want to hear
49:49 and never deliver it or deliver exactly
49:51 the opposite because that was the game
49:52 to begin with okay Trump you may not
49:55 like what he says but least you can rely
49:56 on the fact he won't do anything you
49:57 didn't say you wouldn't do there's no
49:59 mystery out there it's not likely didn't
50:01 say he's gonna do this but he did it oh
50:02 my god there's none of that
50:03 that's exactly what he says there you go
50:06 so you know his whole agenda just listen
50:07 to him talk that's what he's gonna do
50:09 boom that's what you call close friend
50:11 that you can trust what's the other
50:14 medicine so you trustworthy and what
50:16 else you're ignorant to evil because you
50:22 can't conceive of it no one else could
50:23 conceive of it and therefore the world's
50:25 gonna be a great place well I can't I
50:26 can't vision human trafficking and these
50:30 nexium sex cults and child trafficking
50:33 and child pornography you can't think
50:36 about it so no one can do it because you
50:39 can't think about it it's not the way
50:43 the world works is it the globalist
50:46 playoff that they talk about it they
50:48 lament about that that's how they do
50:51 what they do they literally will take an
50:54 evil plan and they'll say this isn't
50:56 evil enough someone's going to conceive
50:59 of this plan and we're gonna get caught
51:01 so make it more evil so that we never
51:03 get caught no one even suspects that we
51:06 could be doing what we're doing that's
51:08 some of us right do you let me challenge
51:13 you I'm gonna challenge you even if
51:15 you're in your car listening to us in a
51:16 podcast you're snuggled up in your bed
51:18 or maybe you're sitting at work and
51:20 however you do that you can listen to my
51:22 voice think about your life take
51:25 inventory and hey I want to acknowledge
51:27 because I don't want everybody to take
51:29 my
51:30 my hopefully infrared in special tact
51:35 here on manifest destiny and create a
51:38 problem that's not there because if your
51:40 life is good it's good and just take a
51:43 deep breath and take care of your life
51:44 put the money away be good to your loved
51:48 ones so you tell people you love them
51:49 every once in a while this could be your
51:51 last day sort of thing you ever know
51:54 maybe it's their last day who knows be
51:56 good and life will be good doesn't mean
51:59 bad things can't happen no because
52:01 someone could be a jerk-off and cross
52:02 into your world and mess up your life
52:04 it's called drunk driving the one drug
52:08 we defend with all of our heart and soul
52:10 right but if you sit there in any cycle
52:14 of your life you're in one of your loops
52:16 and you're not happy let me ask you do
52:22 you ever say to yourself okay I need to
52:24 stop for a second I need to take
52:26 inventory of what I think is going wrong
52:27 I need to acknowledge and remind to
52:31 myself that I'm the one in control
52:33 I completely control my life I control
52:38 it from a physical planning take action
52:40 in this universe strategy and I also
52:45 manifest opportunity to change my life
52:48 to get my dreams on top of that so let's
52:51 say you take the chef's analogy again we
52:53 go back you go to school you go to
52:55 culinary school at night you have maybe
52:57 a friend who's a great chef and just
52:58 pick their brain you experiment you
53:01 create if you're a dessert person you go
53:03 look at those crazy chefs all over the
53:05 world knows you know two Michelin star
53:07 restaurants that are just phenomenal you
53:10 watch every single special on Netflix
53:12 and TV about how they craft all this
53:14 amazing stuff together I mean they just
53:16 wild [ __ ] blow up a balloon put sugar
53:18 all over it pop the balloon pull it out
53:20 and then they serve that as some crusty
53:22 little thing that people can eat
53:23 whatever it is but you need to manifest
53:28 the opportunity for someone to hire you
53:31 manifested and let me tell you the
53:34 secret that Ray Bradbury taught me don't
53:36 tell a bunch of people you're doing this
53:39 because one they'll start hating on you
53:41 and two you'll blow all your energy
53:43 that's been
53:44 given to you by the universe as money as
53:46 currency to go get this dream and you're
53:48 gonna blow it on bragging determinism is
53:52 an interesting theory and it is a theory
53:55 that we needed to come up with we really
53:58 did but I think that the number one
54:01 reason why we needed to come up with
54:03 that theory is so that we could realize
54:05 it's not true coming up with a big bang
54:10 isn't necessarily a sin it's just we do
54:13 the math on me go hmm look at the Stars
54:17 oh my god it's not the Big Bang Wow okay
54:20 so something else maybe we're in is
54:23 maybe we simply exist because there's
54:26 nothing else to do with the energy I
54:28 want you to feel empowered and the last
54:32 thing I'm gonna do is blow smoke okay as
54:36 I smoke a cigar maybe I do suppose blow
54:39 fine tobacco smoke but I'm not gonna lie
54:43 to you about anything to make you feel
54:45 better about yourself or to get
54:46 something going if I ever make you feel
54:49 better about anything or make you feel
54:50 like you got more control in your life
54:52 I'm speaking the most honest words I can
54:55 I can tell you and I think that
54:59 virtually everything that we talk about
55:02 on the show in the comments or you know
55:05 in me just blathering you could take it
55:09 into a court of law and really shake up
55:12 the jury and if there has to be
55:13 reasonable doubt that the previous
55:15 theory is untrue we got him when it
55:19 comes to determinism it wouldn't pass a
55:21 jury it wouldn't
55:23 there's too many experiences in too many
55:25 people's lives if not in their personal
55:29 circles and their immediate circles to
55:32 prove that this isn't the way the
55:34 universe works
55:35 so how would manifest destiny really
55:38 work if a scientist said okay fine
55:39 smarty pants this stick has a tunnel all
55:45 the way down the middle that's why it's
55:46 pulling weird
55:49 if they say how does it work don't you
55:53 say well first and foremost I need you
55:56 to tell me how the brain works tell me
55:59 how that works
56:00 tell me where all the memories of an
56:02 entire 80 year old life exists tell me
56:05 because we've solved for the reason why
56:07 you forget things about your life
56:09 because it's mundane and it's boring and
56:11 your brain is going I don't need this I
56:13 don't need this is the same old crap
56:15 it's boring it's boring it's boring
56:18 that's why that disappears so what about
56:21 all the other rich memories that are out
56:23 there
56:24 what about instinct and intuition maybe
56:28 instinct they would chalk it up to your
56:30 genetics elephants going for water in
56:33 Africa when they haven't been to that
56:35 waterhole in a hundred years if they
56:38 really knew that what gets back to that
56:41 beautiful thing we call the soul that
56:45 other part of our existence that we
56:47 access through our pineal gland there
56:51 are brain stem in order to delve into
56:55 the universe to pull knowledge straight
56:57 out of the universe that's where it
56:59 comes from that's why we can control the
57:03 dice every once in a while it's
57:06 interesting the dye rolling thing is a
57:08 very interesting mechanism because
57:10 usually what we're doing in manifest
57:13 destiny is to drum up a frequency hang
57:15 on to it believe in yourself believe in
57:17 yourself and just like all the
57:18 celebrities of the world you get what
57:20 they want in life they tell that story
57:22 form your dream be very specific about
57:25 your dream don't let things be nebulous
57:28 go for it if you want an Oscar see that
57:32 you want an Oscar and then write
57:34 something that usually gets Oscars don't
57:36 write a comedy it'll never get an Oscar
57:39 just write a great script that means
57:41 something to you and it'll mean that
57:43 something to someone else but was
57:46 interesting about this weird experience
57:48 I had was that it changed my vision
57:50 that's the weird thing both times it
57:53 happened I'm looking at my friends and
57:56 I'm going into another dimension I'm
57:58 literally going into some out-of-body
58:00 experience
58:02 little bit I was in my body but it was
58:04 as if in that moment I went from being
58:07 my body to being my soul observing my
58:10 body through my eye sockets but you know
58:14 it was like I was bigger than myself it
58:18 was literally like God giving you a
58:20 little slit my gibbous Ethernet cable
58:23 watch what happens ear and then it's all
58:25 a sudden I cave while this is in you
58:26 you're gonna be able control everything
58:27 so I'm not gonna let you have it for
58:29 very long and think about something
58:31 ready okay here we go Bing control the
58:33 die boom that was pretty cool right
58:35 that's proof I'm giving you a little bit
58:37 of a tidbit of how this universe works
58:39 just know you have an Ethernet cable
58:41 that goes through the third eye out the
58:44 back brain into the universe and that's
58:47 when you sleep on your pillow at night
58:48 you feel like you're further outside
58:50 your head then you really are the
58:54 universe is a pretty damn cool place to
58:56 be honest even in suffering times again
58:59 one of the most brilliant things in West
59:02 world from HBO this won't run anything
59:05 for you is that they essentially said
59:07 that giving one of the hosts one of the
59:10 androids a AI Keystone or Cornerstone
59:14 that essentially said you have the
59:17 suffering moment in your past allows you
59:21 to appreciate your life you build your
59:23 whole life around it and what's
59:24 fascinating is the writers of comic
59:27 books knew this a long time ago when
59:31 Batman how did Batman get all of his you
59:35 know abilities why did he go and
59:37 research all this technology cuz he was
59:39 a mortal man in the comic book his
59:42 parents got killed in an alleyway and so
59:46 he was like I'm never gonna let that
59:47 happen again LL Cool J talked about the
59:49 fact they asked him like why are you so
59:50 massive like why are you like this big
59:52 cyborg rapper and he wrote his book and
59:55 he learned that he had a horrible
59:57 experience where one of his stepfathers
60:00 came back and shot his mother and his
60:03 grandfather in the freaking kitchen and
60:05 both of them survived I believe but he
60:09 was weak he was a child and he was
60:10 underneath the table hiding in the guy
60:12 didn't see him
60:12 why is he fears you might get a shot
60:14 might have
60:15 shot as well so he determined I am never
60:18 going to be weak again I'm gonna be
60:20 strong and that was his cornerstone well
60:22 being determined to make his body look
60:25 like Mike Tyson's well that was just the
60:28 same discipline he used to make his
60:29 music he told me personally he goes look
60:32 when I was making radio his first album
60:34 he said look I had friends that wanted
60:37 to ride the to my coattails they wanted
60:40 to roar they wanted to participate they
60:42 ran their mouths about how you know how
60:43 much they were gonna help me out but he
60:45 goes I would be at the studio in the
60:47 morning and I find myself by myself cuz
60:50 he wouldn't come until much later they
60:52 just wanted to kind of chill out the
60:53 studio and tell all their friends again
60:55 they're spending all their economy run
60:56 in their mouths instead of being in the
60:58 studio making an album
60:59 LoZ in there working his ass off making
61:02 his first album the guy exploded he was
61:06 on Krush groove we heard five to ten
61:09 seconds of radio and it was over the guy
61:12 was a megastar and then because he built
61:14 true discipline and true capabilities in
61:16 himself he didn't lie to himself he was
61:18 able to make bigger and Deffer after
61:20 that and it was bigger and Deffer it was
61:23 so much fun I have a philosophy in life
61:27 and it goes like this anyone if they try
61:33 really hard can do usually one thing
61:36 really really well through pure
61:38 serendipity you know if we had a hundred
61:41 people who've never played any
61:42 instruments or sang anything in their
61:44 life or every what a piece of music and
61:45 we push them into a hundred separate
61:47 studios and we go look you guys can be
61:49 in there as long as you want one person
61:51 at least out of a hundred is going to
61:53 create a top-ten hit that's gonna be
61:55 like Funkytown
61:57 whip-it Iran I mean you know any one of
62:02 Michael Jackson's big ads maybe it would
62:04 be as amazing as that guy probably but
62:06 someone's gonna create one of those hits
62:08 it's a sheer law of averages but here's
62:13 the thing
62:14 the band's that we still know today that
62:17 made it in the 70s they still perform in
62:19 sold out arenas constantly are the bands
62:22 that figured out how to turn it into a
62:24 machine they developed their talents so
62:27 huge that they brought a crank
62:29 they were able to crank out one tune
62:30 after another after look at the Beatles
62:32 look at the Rolling Stones like a
62:33 Michael Jackson look at Aerosmith Led
62:35 Zeppelin
62:36 there's the band's go on and on and on
62:39 they always deliver gold always clean
62:45 you may not understand every single song
62:47 and like every song but they do they
62:51 made it most bands didn't make filler
62:54 ac/dc back and black boom huge you
62:58 probably will be more happy if you
63:01 intimately understand things enough to
63:03 replicate perfection every single time
63:06 to make a twin of perfection every
63:10 single time you need to you deliver you
63:13 could have one kid and get it right and
63:15 have another kid and continue to get it
63:17 right you could have been good to your
63:20 spouse and you guys weren't compatible
63:22 you go to your next spouse and you're
63:23 still good you have a great relationship
63:25 because finally the other person is
63:27 doing the same thing back but when it
63:29 goes south okay just make sure you
63:34 correct your algorithm because you are
63:37 determining your own life if determinism
63:39 is anything it's you determine what the
63:42 hell's going on some countries in this
63:45 world live in a horrible existence right
63:49 Haiti president 9 States called his
63:52 [ __ ] because he's talking about the
63:55 people and maybe indirectly they allow
63:59 their whole country to be covered in
64:02 filth there's a bunch of countries like
64:06 this right a bunch of countries they
64:08 have tons of money they let huge
64:11 sections of their population to live in
64:13 absolute poverty on a level that's like
64:17 health threatening little kids picking
64:21 in trash to find something to eat some
64:24 people blame capitalism for that which
64:26 means they don't understand what the
64:27 hell they're talking about
64:28 some people think you can wealth
64:30 distribute everything in somehow feral
64:32 human beings that don't take care of
64:33 their world will suddenly learn how to
64:35 take care of their world I don't think
64:37 so man they have to experience that
64:41 enough where they go look man
64:43 how about everybody pick up some trash
64:47 get it out of the water supply and let's
64:51 take it to a dump let's let's pick a big
64:53 piece of land it's not by the [ __ ]
64:55 ocean and let's just put it all there
64:56 and then we'll figure out a way to deal
64:57 with it we'll hire some agency to filter
65:00 through all the trash and recycle it all
65:01 and the rest of what we burn or whatever
65:03 listen I have it in our streets does
65:06 that have bad drinking water let's make
65:08 sure that we get animals that procreate
65:11 really quickly and use that as the great
65:12 food supply hogs and chickens and cattle
65:15 and whatever let's clean this place up
65:17 and then people will invest in us
65:21 because why we have shown that we can
65:23 clean up our world and we just need some
65:24 financing to do the steps that we didn't
65:27 want to take instead of never trying in
65:29 the world goes why should I give you
65:30 money
65:31 seriously you like the kid who just
65:34 wants a bunch of money doesn't want to
65:35 work for it how much you're gonna
65:37 support your kids for the rest of their
65:39 freaking lives when they won't try not
65:42 very many of us right if you don't live
65:46 in those situations you're already
65:49 winning
65:49 aren't you I'll close on this one
65:53 when it comes to determinism and not
65:56 believing in it and believing in
65:57 manifest destiny instead I I used to go
66:03 back to my home town once a year life
66:05 was like that one I had a lot more
66:08 family that lived in the area and I you
66:12 know hey you know I talk about it all
66:14 the time love my hometown it's great
66:16 great place but I would go back and I
66:18 would look at the opportunities and the
66:20 careers that were available and you know
66:22 hey in another world I could do that and
66:24 another life I could do that but you
66:26 should put it that way but I get back on
66:28 that plane and you know I never wanted
66:30 to leave necessarily when I got back on
66:32 the plane and in set two and a half hour
66:34 ride home I mean you know it's in two
66:36 hours to get to the airport and just
66:38 sort of one of those days I just would
66:39 rather not do it's one I'm gonna forget
66:41 for sure and I hop on the plane and then
66:45 I'm addicted and the second I could look
66:47 up the window at Southern California and
66:51 I started seeing Disneyland I started
66:53 seeing the 405 I started seeing the
66:55 beach
66:56 I started thinking about my house this
66:58 is just empty well I'm going and then I
67:01 think about the stuff I got in my house
67:02 and the career that I have and all the
67:04 opportunities that I have manifested in
67:06 my life it all comes back to me as to
67:08 why I'm there I feel super energized
67:11 super energized to be there and then I
67:15 realized that I shouldn't have to get on
67:18 a plane and go back to my hometown
67:19 simply to have that euphoric feeling and
67:22 I have to say when I got back down to
67:24 Southern California it's been that way
67:27 every day looking on at this place
67:29 feeling blessed beyond my dreams that
67:33 I'm where I want to be in every career
67:35 that exists on planet earth is right
67:37 here in Los Angeles not other places
67:41 like that hopefully you love the careers
67:43 that are available in your area because
67:44 of the internet though you can almost do
67:46 anything in the world wherever the hell
67:48 you are maybe you make armor you know
67:52 you build like old you know medieval
67:56 armor and you're sitting in Toledo Ohio
67:58 and you're like what am I gonna do with
68:00 all this armor and you're like oh I'm
68:01 gonna make a Shopify cart and I'm gonna
68:03 sell the crap out of it I'm gonna go on
68:05 eBay I'm gonna go on PayPal make my own
68:08 little website I'm gonna make a Facebook
68:09 page a Twitter account all this other
68:11 stuff now you're you can't even make
68:12 armor fast enough for people that want
68:14 to buy it because you controlled your
68:16 destiny you planned it it took your
68:19 talents you manifested it and I'm
68:22 telling you right now my biggest secret
68:25 for the universe this has been my
68:26 philosophy for 25 years is that you
68:31 treat the universe and yourself like a
68:33 business you're the prospect you're the
68:38 startup at all times the universe is
68:40 your investor you need to show the
68:43 universe that you have what it takes all
68:46 of you know from watching shark tank and
68:48 all these movie all these shows on TV
68:50 even a princess back in the day you have
68:54 to show an investor that you're worth
68:55 investing in and usually they want to
68:59 know you know are you dedicated to this
69:01 this is just a flash in the pan so
69:03 you're looking to make a bunch of money
69:04 and sell the company in two seconds and
69:06 not really nurtured the thing up to a
69:08 truly multi-billion dollar
69:10 operation are you just trying to make a
69:11 lifestyle amount of money and cash out
69:13 no investor wants to give you a couple
69:16 million dollars if any of you've ever
69:18 sought money I always tell you this
69:19 thing well it's easier to raise a
69:21 hundred million dollars than it is to
69:23 raise two million dollars and most
69:25 people go why the hell is that man it's
69:26 it's less money because they're trying
69:30 to make billion dollar companies and a
69:33 hundred million dollars as someone who
69:35 understands how to get to a billion a
69:36 two million dollar person doesn't
69:38 understand what they're talking about
69:39 they're making what's called a lifestyle
69:41 business and there's certain angel
69:43 investors that will get into that your
69:45 dentist or your lawyer or some what
69:47 doctors got a little money on the side
69:48 they know they never have the big cash
69:50 but they do want to make a little bit of
69:52 lifestyle money for themselves so
69:54 they'll invest in you but it's a lot
69:55 harder eventually you have that meeting
69:58 they sit you down they say tell me you
69:59 tell me why I should give you money you
70:01 have to lay out your plan boy your plan
70:03 has to have you know a roadmap to
70:08 fruition to realization then you have to
70:11 have all the risks already thought up
70:14 you have to look at your competition
70:15 improved in them that you've seen your
70:17 competition and you know how to kick
70:18 their ass if you ever say you don't have
70:20 competition be ready for a level 10
70:23 because they're gonna go find your
70:24 competition especially with the internet
70:27 this is all part of you manifesting your
70:30 destiny so you take all those lessons
70:32 that people who have startups are trying
70:35 to well they have to get through to get
70:38 successful and that's what your
70:39 individual life that's your relationship
70:41 with your loved ones relationship with
70:44 your self relationship with your
70:45 employers or your clients you invest in
70:49 yourself and the universe will be right
70:51 there to invest in you the phone won't
70:53 ring if you're not ready
70:55 most the time in fact the truth of the
70:59 matter is is you will I mean I just had
71:03 this experience I'm having this
71:04 experience right now in my life I have
71:06 decided to learn three new platforms on
71:09 the internet the languages that I
71:13 program in are being used in different
71:15 ways that I haven't used them in yet and
71:17 so I went in going gee am i spending my
71:21 time wisely I mean I'm writing
71:22 learning these platforms sure enough the
71:27 second that I started learning these
71:28 platforms my phone's ringing off the
71:29 hook to go do this stuff I mean off the
71:32 hook I woke up this morning I missed six
71:35 calls while I was asleep his people
71:37 calling me between like 7:00 and 9:00 my
71:39 time of course I'm not recording for you
71:41 guys I get up and follow up with all
71:44 these folks and it's just one
71:45 opportunity after another I'm now making
71:47 you choices to the opportunity I'm gonna
71:49 take and you know the ones I'm picking
71:52 the ones I'm picking are two guys I met
71:56 we have an opening they're not capable
71:59 of paying the full salary that I could
72:02 probably get I mean I've got a lot of
72:03 offers that are way higher than that
72:04 like tens of thousands of dollars more
72:06 per year but you know what's attracting
72:09 me to these two young guys which is a
72:10 third guy I haven't met yet but it's
72:13 because they're young they're tenacious
72:16 they built a really cool company and I'd
72:19 rather help those guys get to the next
72:21 level
72:21 if I'm if I want those extra extra 20
72:24 grand out of those guys per year I'm
72:26 gonna earn it I'm gonna help them grow
72:28 their business and that's what's
72:30 interesting to me it's what's a
72:31 challenge to me right
72:33 I'm manifesting that destiny maybe they
72:37 like me maybe they don't we'll find out
72:38 I've already talked to him once and they
72:40 dug me so I'm going for it it's cool I'm
72:44 reinventing myself I need something new
72:47 I need some challenging I need to
72:49 collaborate with other people working at
72:52 home has got its benefits but you know
72:55 you learn something when you're with
72:56 other people it's great so your homework
73:00 is this if there's anything you need to
73:04 change what are you doing about that
73:07 first thing you need to do is change
73:09 your mind about it tell yourself first
73:13 if something is critically bad so
73:16 yourself everything's gonna be okay
73:17 because it is second determine what you
73:23 can do to take steps to change your life
73:27 maybe it means hanging out with certain
73:30 people a little bit less maybe you have
73:32 to make some major changes in your
73:34 relationships maybe just need to commute
73:37 the other people look man I'm gone after
73:39 this and it's really hard and I just
73:41 need a little bit of support you've been
73:42 pretty quiet I kind of interpret that as
73:44 you don't support me you know if you're
73:47 married to somebody you go look if I
73:49 make more money we make more money we
73:51 have a better time together you know one
73:53 of my Bajor gripes in life is that the
73:55 people I've dated in my life have always
73:57 wanted to spend my money just as fast as
73:59 I make it oh let's go do this let's go
74:01 do that and it's like well when I needed
74:02 you to support me while I was changing
74:05 my life to get this money or working my
74:07 ass off you were nowhere to be found now
74:10 I got the cash you're ready to spend it
74:12 all bye-bye see you later
74:15 sometimes those have been the toughest
74:17 decisions I've ever made in my life
74:19 but tell you what they were the best
74:22 decisions I ever made
74:23 and I'll continue making in my whole
74:26 life as a caveat to the whole thing I
74:30 will say be really honest with yourself
74:32 and you know where it seems impossible
74:36 maybe that just means it's hard it's not
74:38 impossible it's just hard I'll just be
74:40 hunkered down hunker down and say okay
74:43 I'm gonna go for a probably level nine
74:45 and even if I fail level nine I'm
74:48 probably gonna end up at level eight or
74:50 seven and a half and that's gonna be a
74:52 hell of a lot better than life on Matt
74:53 which is it a - that's the way it works
74:57 help you feel me if you have been to
75:00 deep thoughts radio.com please go it's
75:02 where you have audio-video Locke
75:04 Facebook group a Twitter account a
75:06 patreon page and a PayPal plus it has
75:09 the glorious link to season one the
75:11 remastered version of the first hundred
75:14 episodes on this particular channel yes
75:16 you can go to this channel and look up
75:18 all the episodes from the 1 to 100 but
75:21 they will be atrociously balanced and
75:25 audio and I've actually shortened some
75:28 of the videos by almost 10 minutes by
75:30 cutting out a bunch of pauses and that
75:31 sort of things so if you want to get
75:33 through them quicker you'll have fun any
75:36 of you in Europe who can't find certain
75:37 episodes because they're locked out of
75:39 view
75:39 you'll find them in season one when
75:41 we're up to 41 as of this episode I have
75:44 no idea what number this episode is
75:45 going to be but hopefully by the time
75:48 this gets out I'll be in the 50s or 60s
75:50 I do about four or five at a time so
75:54 hopefully enjoy that but until then take
75:56 care of yourself and someone else and
75:58 I'll see in the next deep thoughts over
76:00 now
