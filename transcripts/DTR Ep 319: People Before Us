00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts it's very early cool
00:40 morning in what we're gonna call early
00:45 winter of Southern California I just
00:49 worked the entire evening until morning
00:53 so this is my my dinner my relaxation
00:57 air today I want to bring to you guys a
01:00 little gym that one of the guys I spoke
01:04 with just happened to say it wasn't
01:06 trying to make a big point I don't think
01:08 he was even choosing his words carefully
01:12 or anything he was giving a it was
01:19 giving a description I think in his
01:21 language and bringing it to English and
01:24 the way he said it was beautiful he
01:28 mentioned that people before you and
01:30 then he made a point that we're gonna
01:32 make this whole episode about because I
01:36 don't know about you but I never really
01:39 thought about it so simple why do I
01:42 think a lot of the things that I think
01:45 because the people before me why do I
01:49 believe history and other paradigms of
01:55 existence because of the people before
01:58 me how are we other lis controlled in
02:02 this world how's that even possible
02:05 because of the people before us right
02:08 now you might think that that's like
02:11 splitting a little bit of hairs and just
02:13 instead of just saying history or the
02:16 past I think saying people before you is
02:21 so much more powerful because it gives
02:27 you a pinpoint of accountability in the
02:30 equation of history right if I say
02:33 history well then it's everything it's a
02:36 freaking butterfly and Peru it's the
02:38 price of tea in China it's how you know
02:41 humid it was and Madagascar you know
02:47 but if you say no no no wait there's
02:51 things that you can blame on nature and
02:53 they're nature's thing nature's cycle
02:55 and then there's the intent of people
03:00 before us or the lack of attention of
03:03 the people before us which then leaves
03:05 us and neither a advantage or
03:09 disadvantage moment perhaps in some rare
03:13 cases but nine moments right I forgot
03:17 what we were watching so I think in this
03:20 episode I'm gonna run backwards we're
03:22 going to look at a bunch of different
03:23 things and sort of assess the pros and
03:27 cons of the people before us give some
03:29 credit where credit's due
03:31 maybe exonerate a few and then I think
03:35 we need to bring the whole thing back to
03:38 now and as we look in the mirror as
03:41 Michael Jackson would say or contemplate
03:45 who we are going to be on a daily basis
03:47 and what we're willing to sacrifice for
03:50 ourselves for our families for our
03:52 friends and others humanity if you can
03:55 so much as muster up the empathy to
03:58 acknowledge such a thing which you're a
04:00 part of let's see what we can go I'm
04:05 trying to think about how far to go back
04:07 should I crawl from now to ancient times
04:11 or should we start at ancient times
04:13 which is barely any definition at all
04:16 right let's talk about the positive
04:20 first and again this episode is going to
04:24 be a first a broad-stroke brush to open
04:29 up your mind to see this cycle and then
04:33 hopefully a fine tooth brush that comes
04:37 through and starts to put some details
04:40 in right there are seven wonders of the
04:43 world at least that's what I was brought
04:46 up with seven places on earth of which I
04:52 believe man has to participate in its
04:54 creation
04:56 and I think what's absolutely
04:59 fascinating is one of the oldest if
05:05 probably you know again there's a bunch
05:07 of weird dates for things but and I
05:11 think Graham Hancock's research and our
05:13 own sort of epiphanies of recent
05:16 research the Egyptian pyramids are the
05:23 oldest amazing thing that we really
05:26 definitively know about right we find
05:30 temples and other locations like again
05:34 Stonehenge which was moved in 1954 and
05:37 so we're not sure I'm not sure where
05:39 these people came from I think it's
05:44 hilarious that people want to think that
05:48 Stonehenge has to be older than the
05:50 pyramids simply because it's more
05:51 primitive because people and my people
05:54 in England were definitely smarter than
05:56 the black people of Africa no no I think
05:59 we might have been the last one to join
06:01 the race okay but now it's not what I'm
06:04 getting into let's not get carried away
06:06 I don't know about you but the pyramids
06:10 are one of the most awe-inspiring
06:17 inquisitive things to have ever existed
06:22 on this planet I used to think that the
06:25 older I got and the more I to understand
06:27 about engineering you know just you know
06:29 I'm not getting a degree in it but I
06:30 mean just hearing people talk about it
06:32 all someone's gonna figure this thing
06:33 out the truth of matter is it's more of
06:38 a mystery today and we know more about
06:40 them today then ever before in history
06:45 you know well for a long time it was all
06:47 buried but here we have things pretty
06:50 excavated obviously you can't talk to
06:53 the museum of Cairo unless you want to
06:55 get a bunch of cartoon characters
06:58 putting it together but they're based on
07:02 pie
07:04 they're made out of four corners to
07:06 create a pyramid so it wasn't all just
07:10 made up as one big thing
07:11 the Great Pyramid has slanted stones and
07:14 it's terior it's electric it's got
07:16 conductive stone and non conductive
07:18 stone
07:18 it's got circuitry made out of red
07:21 granite inside how they even suspended
07:25 this stuff in the pyramid such that a
07:27 one-block didn't just kind of Ginga you
07:30 know and crush somebody you know again
07:32 bunch of the stuff at diagonal angles
07:35 nup stays together it's been around for
07:38 a really long time even official news
07:42 puts it at five thousand years old over
07:45 five thousand years old amazing probably
07:48 goes back fifty or more at least 39
07:56 those were some people before us and of
07:58 course I'm neglecting all the other
08:00 great structures which you can listen to
08:02 in any YouTube video I did want to call
08:04 monolithic structures those pyramids for
08:09 me represent this mind-opening
08:12 thing once I stopped believing they were
08:15 tombs but even if I thought they were
08:17 tombs and got into the most elaborate
08:19 tombs ever made which they're absolutely
08:21 anything but a tomb it still says Wow
08:27 Here I am with all this technology I've
08:30 got a cell phone over there sitting on
08:33 the table that's got more computer power
08:35 you know a million times more computer
08:38 power than anything in 1979 or 88 and I
08:42 can't figure out how those pyramids were
08:44 made
08:47 we have 7.5 billion people on earth no
08:49 one who has existed to date has figured
08:53 those things out I mean not even the
08:56 most basic methodology of how to stack
08:58 2.3 million stones into one pyramid
09:03 people before us Wow
09:07 now why aren't those people here to tell
09:10 us how they did it
09:12 right I mean the Egyptian Museum of
09:15 Cairo the very last race to actually
09:18 participate in that area wants you to
09:19 think that they made them but they
09:22 didn't those people who made that place
09:23 but long gone
09:25 okay we never documented how they ever
09:29 built the place but the reason why
09:30 they're not there is because of other
09:33 people before them right people who were
09:37 into conquest right in the history of
09:41 our ancestors we will always have a
09:44 group of people that invent a utopia now
09:47 it's gonna take a long time to do it
09:49 again but eventually we will get this
09:52 place to utopia and if we can do it with
09:55 technology and the cool thing is is we
09:57 could probably maintain it as long as we
09:59 can again get rid of the DNA that's
10:01 gonna screw the place up but in the past
10:03 it was all regional there's a place that
10:05 had utopia and a bunch of places that
10:07 sucked and of course the people that
10:11 could figure down bring in with sticks
10:15 and stones and whatever the hell they
10:16 had figured out and took over the better
10:19 places and then of course they didn't
10:21 have the sophistication or the
10:24 intelligence to maintain it so it starts
10:26 to wane the only things that exists are
10:29 the things that can't be torn down it
10:31 was you know you would might not know
10:32 how to take care of a pyramid or a
10:35 temple but you can't just tear the thing
10:37 down it's no point in tearing it down
10:39 although they do say that all the stones
10:42 were looted off the outer coating of the
10:45 pyramids right as indicated by one of
10:49 the cap stones right if those things
10:52 were batteries then the number one thing
10:54 you'd have to do to make sure that no
10:56 one knows that their batteries is to
10:58 take off all that external stone but
11:01 even that would be a feat wouldn't it
11:04 they used to say that when I was a kid
11:06 that those outer stones were taken so
11:09 that by looters that wanted to use the
11:10 stone for something else I don't know
11:13 how many people could use slanted stone
11:15 because it was outer stones were all cut
11:17 right but they were looted strange
11:22 I just love the subject I'm sorry I'm
11:25 digressing the next thing I want to get
11:28 to is the paradigm of war the paradigm
11:31 of taking someone else's stuff now the
11:35 idea is is that you know if you want to
11:38 go into a forest right when you look at
11:40 Deadwood the history of Deadwood South
11:42 Dakota
11:43 I think it's South Dakota it's a valley
11:47 it's underdeveloped it's got you know
11:49 tons of trees and these settlers want to
11:51 go in there and mine all the gold they
11:54 do a bunch of gold prospecting and so
11:55 they got in there and they clear-cut the
11:57 place with their bare [ __ ] hands and
11:58 got the place situated well now what if
12:03 they had the option of a place that's
12:04 already lived in it has the same you
12:06 know inspirational gold mother lodes
12:10 well they would have gone there instead
12:11 right so war has happened for a billion
12:16 reasons over the course of a couple
12:19 thousand years the leadership discovered
12:21 well Jesus you know what you know and
12:23 the people you know what saved my ass
12:25 from getting you know lynched by the
12:26 people when I couldn't feed them and
12:28 also there's stuff that war I have with
12:29 you I mean they just they just stopped
12:32 focusing on their problems that I was
12:33 creating for them because I was eating
12:35 all their food myself and so I think
12:40 that should be the way we do this every
12:42 once while you pretend to hate me I'll
12:43 pretend to hate you you know we'll sneak
12:45 out into that Bohemian Grove every once
12:47 in a while and do each other war came
12:52 after the last utopia which was the
12:55 Egyptian rule of northern Egypt I mean
12:59 if you look at the whole spectrum of the
13:01 planet it's a teeny tiny area on the
13:03 planet it's bigger than Rhode Island but
13:05 I think it's smaller than California
13:07 right and they had managed to just
13:10 absolutely master technology and if our
13:12 hunches are correct about their
13:14 electricity and things like that then
13:19 they were ahead of Tesla but what
13:24 happened when war and I did a whole
13:26 episode on Worst I'm not gonna try to
13:27 repeat myself but what happened when war
13:30 became an acceptable means for people to
13:35 solve their problems
13:38 isn't it funny that people will be lazy
13:43 about information and this is gonna be
13:47 singing to the choir just a bit but let
13:48 me put this little quiver this little
13:50 excuse me arrow in your quiver people
13:54 deny the truth all the time right they
13:57 deny that evil people are evil that that
14:00 foundations steal money and in traffic
14:03 kids and all this other stuff right
14:04 because it hurts our little feelings but
14:08 the end result of that denial going day
14:13 in and day out and year in and year out
14:15 is that eventually your soul to war to
14:20 solve the problem in a lot of cases
14:21 right now obviously an absolute sense my
14:27 example is not very accurate but
14:28 something is communicated to us that we
14:31 could respond to and we don't respond to
14:33 it and it's a grows and it festers the
14:36 propaganda to make us hate someone else
14:38 grows and Fester's right so you have
14:41 maybe an injustice going on a particular
14:43 type particular place in the world and
14:45 then you are sold the disinformation
14:46 through all of your you know corporate
14:49 media everything sitcoms movies [ __ ]
14:53 everything right it makes you want to go
14:55 over and kick their ass or at least
14:57 support someone who has been given the
15:00 job to do so but then your kid grows up
15:05 becomes a big badass right and they
15:08 enlist in the military and that you're
15:11 very proud of that and they're very
15:12 happy to be there but then they get sent
15:14 to one of these wars and that's when as
15:16 a parent you go ooh wait a minute that's
15:19 that's way more real than this this yell
15:23 at the TV that we should go Newcombe and
15:27 my kids going over there there's my kid
15:30 really ready for war I mean most parents
15:33 should ask that question at one point I
15:35 can't able to see death and still
15:37 maintain you know functional infantry
15:41 training you know is it possible
15:43 right hopefully the answer is yes
15:47 how many wars have we've been in that
15:49 now we find out to revise history that
15:53 the people before us created the war out
15:56 of absolutely nothing financed the war
16:01 said that the good guys were bad and the
16:03 bad guys were good and damn it if some
16:05 of those wars you didn't find out you
16:08 belong to the wrong side again the
16:12 Internet's causing some problems for the
16:14 people trying to hang on to some of this
16:16 narrative and a lot of you comment in
16:19 the comments section and I don't put my
16:22 [ __ ] out there but we're on the same
16:23 page
16:24 ok I am it at a minimum throwing up
16:30 everything that I thought was one way
16:31 and considering the possibility strongly
16:35 that it might have been the other way
16:36 but let's just look at some mores that
16:38 are very simple to say they were
16:39 [ __ ] the North Korean police
16:43 operation right it's not a war it's a
16:46 police operation complete [ __ ]
16:48 [ __ ] selling you that those dumb
16:51 down nomenclature so that it feels like
16:53 it's something oh we're just we're just
16:55 over there for free no a police thing
16:57 we'll go ask everybody who died over
17:00 there or got injured over there from our
17:01 side completely pointless and what is
17:06 ironic and amazing and unbelievable is
17:09 that they sold them another war not more
17:13 than was it 1954 that was over say start
17:16 one but nine years later in 1963 to fake
17:19 Gulf of Tonkin events they started
17:21 another one of those wars in Vietnam and
17:23 this [ __ ] lasts for what about 12 years
17:27 killed the crap out of all kinds of
17:29 people our side their side and now every
17:32 time you meet a Vietnamese person
17:33 personally you're embarrassed right it's
17:36 like I'm really sorry I mean that I
17:37 wasn't really alive at the time that was
17:39 going on our spending you know I was a
17:40 little child okay you think it would
17:45 learn a lesson right but now why do we
17:48 join some of these organizations because
17:53 of the people before us did you know
17:58 now again I would have loved to serve my
18:00 country I was a geek instead and moved
18:04 to California and got a dream career
18:07 going plus when I was moving out here
18:09 there was nothing going on 1987
18:12 there's no major war effort a bunch of
18:16 my friends who were a Desert Storm
18:17 wearing it for 48 hours and then they
18:20 were out it's pretty peaceful time how
18:27 many people are you know they have a
18:29 like a tradition in their family they're
18:31 all police officers they're all this
18:33 they're all that it's very interesting
18:34 and it's can be a really really cool
18:37 thing you pass down all the secrets
18:41 right
18:41 Al Unser al unser jr. you know I mean it
18:44 happens but the main thrust of people
18:48 before you is propaganda disinformation
18:52 now for everybody who was raised by a
18:55 parent that wasn't raised with the
18:58 Internet
18:59 as a part of their life we have to give
19:01 them a little bit of a reprieve because
19:05 the information that they got was
19:06 through extremely formalized and super
19:08 controlled yellow journalism very
19:12 intense intensely controlled publishing
19:16 companies that report to you know them
19:21 go see my episode on them you have any
19:23 questions so my parents it's no way for
19:29 them to really wake up at this point
19:31 it's impossible one they had a
19:34 completely picture-perfect life I mean
19:36 in terms of what America said the
19:38 America dream was yeah it was 100% on
19:41 target which means the variables you
19:44 know didn't get everything you wanted
19:45 but damn near right but I've said as I
19:50 said before you know if you're raised a
19:51 mutt your life is a little bit weird
19:54 your parents got divorced that's your
19:55 first qualification of being a mutt and
19:57 you moved around a lot instead of
19:59 actually staying in the same place
20:00 that'll make you even more of a mutt and
20:02 if you manage to become successful that
20:05 makes you a super mud because you're
20:08 crafty
20:10 right your street-smart you're
20:13 enlightened because you can see more you
20:16 couldn't see more you wouldn't be
20:17 successful but today everyone should be
20:21 woke who grew up with the internet I'd
20:24 say everyone born probably from 1980 and
20:28 up anyone 1990 and up hell yes and 2000
20:33 up you guys have no excuse free for
20:36 being a nun teef a douchebag you know
20:38 you should be absolutely a mercenary for
20:42 the Republic but why do we keep up
20:46 really shitty activities you know you've
20:50 got this thing between the Palestinians
20:52 and the Israelis and you guys always
20:54 want me to talk about the Jews and how
20:56 bad they are and stuff I am going to do
20:57 an episode about Judaism and Zionism
21:02 difference between the population that
21:05 is almost 80% atheist and the Zionists
21:10 that are completely different species of
21:12 human being I don't mean that literally
21:15 but you know I'm saying but they fight
21:18 they've been fighting for a really long
21:20 time it got really intense after the
21:22 League of Nations made Israel a country
21:25 got really intense but there's all kinds
21:28 of places around the world that are
21:29 doing that Yemen one of the places it's
21:31 it's probably the most poverty-stricken
21:33 countries I don't mean to laugh but it's
21:35 like the second thing I'm going to say
21:37 is more the richest countries in the
21:39 world Saudi Arabia is always attacking
21:42 the [ __ ] out of them what's all that
21:45 about right that Pakistan in India they
21:48 bicker a line why the for us you could
21:51 stand it a Pakistani guy in front of me
21:53 and a Indian guy in front I mean I
21:55 probably couldn't tell you which which
21:57 country they're from but they fight like
21:59 they're you know humans against the
22:03 zindies you know I don't know Africa oh
22:07 my god
22:08 how many dualities genocidal dualities
22:12 exist in africa currently it's insane
22:16 absolutely insane
22:19 but how did all that come about and why
22:23 and how could anyone rationalize these
22:26 senseless bickering moments between two
22:29 groups I think it's because of the
22:33 people before us handing down this
22:36 hatred you know you got to hate them
22:39 you're chosen
22:41 they're not even though you're almost
22:43 exactly the same you have the same
22:44 bloodline here so you got to kill him
22:46 whatever you got to do you know some guy
22:48 gets shot in his last dying breath you
22:51 waste your whole life waste your whole
22:53 life for me
22:54 you know hating them over there I think
22:58 what's interesting and horrible and
23:02 fascinating to repeat myself is it one
23:07 of the races on this planet they got the
23:09 most taken out of them and probably
23:12 Aborigines are a close second is the
23:14 Native Americans now we're told a lot of
23:18 things about them obviously being
23:19 savages and all this the truth of matter
23:23 is we now have seen that in so many
23:25 scripts we know how the game is played
23:28 you want to get it rid of somebody will
23:30 start calling them a name start
23:31 reprogramming the minds of people before
23:35 they get to move over there indoctrinate
23:38 them into saying this is your land these
23:40 guys aren't supposed to be here when
23:42 they or the indigenous race right
23:55 I'll leave that in say it's waved my
23:58 arms the crow sees me through the
24:00 through the lattice above me and he
24:03 flies off because he thinks I'm a
24:04 big-ass bird little trick for you guys
24:09 now the Native Americans are obviously
24:11 not happy with the situation but in my
24:16 lifetime and in the history that I have
24:18 digested which is probably a tiny
24:23 molecule of all the history I've never
24:26 heard of an uprising of Native Americans
24:30 when I've gone to reservations
24:33 unfortunately I've seen a broken people
24:35 and it makes me concerned that they're
24:40 broken and continue to be broken now
24:42 again I'm not saying the whole race is
24:44 broken and you you couldn't make me
24:46 happier than to have a a repopulation of
24:51 their incredible you credibly unique
24:55 race I mean their their genes are just
24:57 just amazing right I mean I grew up in a
25:01 Native American world in Kansas or my
25:04 best friend's whole family was Native
25:05 American and I just thought this is what
25:07 it was I thought it was cowboys and
25:09 Indians but we all kind of settled our
25:10 war so we're just all hanging out
25:11 together you know and I moved away and I
25:13 was like either no Native Americans
25:15 anywhere else like everything's named
25:17 after them right but I fear that they've
25:20 been indoctrinated into giving up right
25:24 some of the saddest things you can ever
25:27 read saddest letters you're gonna ever
25:28 read are from the Native American Chiefs
25:32 that had to deal with the pounding from
25:39 the white bin the humble nature of their
25:43 letters and you know they were quoted as
25:45 saying you know look it appears the gods
25:49 want the white men to win or else why
25:52 would he give him the ships and these
25:53 guns and these is technology to just
25:56 wipe us off the map
26:00 I don't know that I would ever write
26:03 that letter I don't know that I'm big
26:05 enough as a as a I don't know an
26:09 intellectual person to say that right
26:12 they did often the gist of this episode
26:17 if it's not becoming very apparent here
26:19 is how much of who you are today is a
26:24 direct by-product aka
26:26 transfer of someone else's knowledge and
26:30 opinions directly into you I mean you
26:34 know we always say we have these little
26:35 things you know the what is that the
26:37 fruit doesn't fall far from the tree
26:40 meaning you're like your parents and you
26:45 know in one realm if you're able to live
26:47 with your parents and have an extremely
26:48 close relationship with your parents
26:50 that might be the most beautiful thing
26:52 and the best compliment in the world
26:54 because your parents are amazing people
26:55 and I hope that for every single one of
26:58 you for me my parents were all into
27:01 themselves and so zooms they had me like
27:04 man we're not [ __ ] doing that again
27:05 Jesus Christ I cut into my personal time
27:08 right and then when they divorced when I
27:10 was by nine years old
27:12 I was just like all right I get rid of
27:14 this layer of micromanagement I think
27:17 the [ __ ] could do what I want this is
27:19 great and so the more I crawled into
27:21 books and Technology and arts and all
27:23 that kind of stuff and they were
27:24 thrilled to death he just totally takes
27:27 care of himself oh my god we can do
27:29 whatever we want mm-hmm so I never had
27:31 this huge connection with either one of
27:33 my parents
27:33 I love them but I don't have if you have
27:36 a really close relationship with your
27:37 parents you got something I've never had
27:39 right the reason I mentioned that is
27:42 that I think a lot of this practice of
27:45 the people before us I got out of
27:49 external sources right because they
27:51 didn't have a big internal source except
27:54 my grandparents and some of my aunts and
27:57 uncles but now let me ask you does every
28:00 single person who existed before you who
28:02 you might meet after you're born do they
28:05 all inspire you you take all the advice
28:08 from everyone that you ever meet hell no
28:11 right you wait for
28:14 this sounds smart you wait for an
28:17 example of a human being that has
28:19 something that you want
28:21 probably well you know a Patil Donald
28:24 Trump becoming president a lot of folks
28:26 bought his books attended his lectures
28:28 and had no problem with the guy and
28:29 after became president you know they got
28:32 all this well what what party am i I
28:33 can't think for myself okay yes we hate
28:35 him we hate him okay why don't we eat
28:37 him always a racist okay how was your
28:40 racist we don't care that there's no
28:41 facts about that okay sure right this is
28:46 so new to me that as I make this episode
28:47 and really just surveying my own mind as
28:49 to some of the highlights and the
28:52 archetypal highlights of things where I
28:54 I there was an attempt to shut my mind
28:59 off and I fought back you know I'm
29:03 trying to think of ones where I was
29:04 completely indoctrinated you know and I
29:06 think that a lot of the official stories
29:08 that were told as young kids you know we
29:11 went to the moon the Harvey Oswald shot
29:15 JFK thanks sort of thing 9/11 was
29:18 totally Osama bin Laden Dada
29:21 I bought it all hook line and sinker for
29:24 a while where I was actually being
29:28 fairly progressive was that I was
29:31 inspired by folks that I would later
29:33 become very good friends with as I
29:36 watched films as a young kid and I fell
29:40 in love with Sid me like I've said I did
29:42 a whole episode on him in season three
29:46 like it's the last episode I grew up
29:51 with his stuff on TV and I and the
29:53 movies and he just drew things
29:57 differently but he drew them in a way
29:59 you could understand them and so you're
30:01 looking at it going okay I understand
30:03 exactly what he did is the finished
30:04 product but how did he get here and I'm
30:06 not quite sure let's look at this this
30:08 is weird that's just sort of that okay
30:10 yeah sure right and to get your brain
30:12 thinking differently there's shapes in
30:15 this world that that children have a
30:17 hard time conceiving of until you give
30:19 them a second to really digest it right
30:21 is it a tetrahedron the 20-sided die
30:25 there's all kinds of crazy
30:28 you know symmetrical shapes and
30:30 asymmetrical shaves you you craft it you
30:32 give it to a baby to look at when they
30:34 can start holding stuff and they're
30:36 gonna start looking at this thing go
30:37 what is this thing and their brain is
30:39 trying to conceive of all the the
30:41 crevices and how the polygons all
30:43 connect together it's extremely healthy
30:45 for the brain right well Sid was that
30:47 for me starting with the movie Tron 1982
30:52 right I always felt like I could feel
30:55 good design like it's some part of my
30:59 genes you know I saw something beautiful
31:02 I just felt it you know one thing felt
31:05 better than the other but when I started
31:09 crossing over into academic science was
31:12 when I really started to feel what this
31:13 guy was talking about this these people
31:16 before me and it was very interesting
31:18 and I've mentioned this once before when
31:20 I was in physics class my thing was that
31:22 I had already studied probably I got
31:26 into physics I think in my senior year
31:28 yeah and does that take all these
31:32 prerequisites and also the crab but I
31:35 would have been 16 years old so I would
31:38 have probably had a good seven years of
31:41 physics before I got into high school
31:44 and you know my teachers complaint was
31:47 that he'd mentioned something and I'd
31:49 mentioned the textbook paragraph just
31:52 off the top of my head and it cut down
31:55 on a lot of the mental exploration of
31:58 the other students right because I give
32:00 the answer and then no one else is like
32:02 okay yeah what he said
32:03 right but so I had six years to think
32:06 about some of these these theories
32:08 before they were being taught to me in
32:11 class and one of the things that was
32:13 extremely frustrating to me was that
32:16 they were saying that you know nothing
32:18 could go the speed of light because
32:20 according to equals mc-squared the whole
32:23 universe has to push one particle but
32:26 the particles missing from the push and
32:27 it would need itself to push itself and
32:30 thus absurd goddamn theory because
32:34 you're sitting there thinking well light
32:36 goes the speed of light right and of
32:39 course they didn't teach us that Tesla
32:41 and Faraday had tracted it you know 50
32:44 times the speed of light like a hundred
32:47 years before I being taught this it was
32:51 completely figured out so my teacher
32:53 puts it on the board and he boils down
32:55 through the formula of exactly what this
32:57 meant and some of the ramifications and
32:59 then he says the line that we can't go
33:01 this big a light because of this formula
33:03 and I'm sitting there staring at chalk
33:06 that's been rubbed off on black slate
33:08 and that is inspiring my teacher to come
33:12 up with this people before him theory
33:15 that says well we don't need to go down
33:17 this route anymore because it's been
33:19 completely figured out we can't do this
33:23 can't can't can't can't KITT well what's
33:26 interesting was seven years earlier as I
33:27 was cracking open the world encyclopedia
33:30 looking at my first fission class my
33:35 teacher who was my I only have really
33:36 one art teacher that was a private guy
33:39 was hired outside my school and he if
33:43 you ever said can't he stopped you from
33:46 your project which was usually painting
33:48 and oils and he would pull you out and
33:50 sit you down and give you a pencil and
33:52 he'd say make your hand like this you
33:56 know where you can see all the gross
33:57 parts and he goes draw that and you
33:59 can't go back to your painting until
34:01 you've finished this hand and one guy
34:04 did it one guy actually said he can't
34:06 and he had to draw it and he whined and
34:08 moaned but then he drew a perfectly
34:10 wonderful hand and he was like oh [ __ ] I
34:13 guess I can as he goes back to his
34:15 painting and it I can't read what he
34:19 painted but my teacher had two deformed
34:22 hands so on his right hand he only had
34:24 his his index finger and his thumb and I
34:28 was left hand his all his fingers were
34:32 very interesting they were just very
34:34 kind of bubbly shapes but nothing he
34:36 could pinch things with it but he
34:37 couldn't really do stuff he's
34:39 right-handed anyway so he just grabs the
34:40 brush painted this beautiful Safari
34:43 stuff I mean the guy there's nothing
34:44 this guy campaign mister Dolloff his
34:48 slogan was art is my game he's still
34:50 alive
34:51 he's in Derby Kansas I believe superdude
34:56 I love to hang out with him so he was
35:01 breaking my mind of saying okay you
35:03 think you can't stop saying that you
35:05 know no one ever discovered anything
35:06 because they started off their day with
35:08 well let's see what we can't do and this
35:11 can't do it some more right mm-hmm one
35:15 of the things we don't want to allow as
35:17 the people before us to shape our minds
35:21 before we've had a chance to figure out
35:24 what shape we would have made it the
35:26 first place right I never thought about
35:29 it when I was a child but obviously at
35:32 this later stage of 2018 I think the
35:34 Internet has proven through mass
35:36 communication that racism hmm
35:39 well save like some really interpersonal
35:43 problem that might have happened and
35:45 then you blame the person's genetics for
35:49 their behavior right racism is probably
35:53 a completely taught paradigm of
35:56 existence it destroys the world it's
36:03 responsible for a lot of things I've
36:05 already mentioned to date right it would
36:08 be interesting to raise a child not
36:12 outside of the confines of safety and
36:14 good common sense but when it came to
36:18 things like science and perhaps the arts
36:22 and perhaps sociology and how we look at
36:25 each other instead of saying well you
36:29 can't do that you can't you just simply
36:33 say well we haven't figured out how to
36:34 do that yet there's some people who
36:37 think that we can't and they worship a
36:40 religion called science with a capital S
36:42 and it gives them comfort they go on to
36:46 YouTube channels and posts feverishly
36:49 about how they're right and how you're
36:51 wrong so they can feel better about
36:53 themselves and sleep at night they don't
36:56 really know either there's a lot of
36:58 people who believe that there's a magic
37:00 guy that came down from the sky and at a
37:02 virgin birth
37:04 26 times and 26 different names and 26
37:07 different places on earth 26 different
37:09 times in history but the last guy that
37:13 came was the one that most people
37:15 remember on this planet you know when
37:16 you asked me what year it is well that's
37:18 the year when they rumoured him to have
37:21 died and that makes it more real for
37:24 them now maybe he did come down 26 times
37:27 and this is something that just needs to
37:29 happen or maybe it's just an old story
37:31 that provides a lot of control for one
37:34 group of people to control another group
37:36 of people and it's handed down by the
37:39 people before us
37:41 haven't you ever gone to bed at night
37:44 you're laying on your pillow and you you
37:47 have this submit and it could be
37:49 anything right my team sure I'm gonna
37:51 give you an example it's something in
37:54 your behavior maybe you're sensitive
37:55 about something and you wish you weren't
37:56 sensitive about it or maybe you're just
37:59 lazy if you're really not lazy compared
38:02 to most people but she drish you were
38:04 more focused you watch the Steve Jobs
38:06 this is one that kills me I never you
38:11 know walked into Steve's office every
38:13 single day to you know see how he did
38:15 his thing man the guy was productive I
38:17 mean just everywhere all the time work
38:21 work work work work maybe he was a
38:23 little bit on level 11 and maybe he
38:25 needed to be on like level seven or
38:27 eight to have a really healthy family I
38:29 don't know but you just want a little
38:32 bit of that are you thinking geez if I
38:34 could just go bed tonight and the
38:35 operating system that is me in this
38:38 mortal coil my soul is probably perfect
38:40 and it can concentrate all day long but
38:43 the mortal coil for whatever reason the
38:45 way I'm feeding myself the way I'm
38:46 getting good rest or not good rest it's
38:50 allowing me to be less than what I want
38:54 and you just think I just want to go to
38:57 bed and get an update just the
38:59 auto-install man just upgrade that
39:01 little piece of my software so tomorrow
39:03 I can make it happen
39:05 well now rewind for a second and ask
39:09 yourself why do you think you have those
39:11 issues in the first place
39:14 sometimes kids are lazy because their
39:16 parents are lazy sometimes they're lazy
39:19 because their parents are absolutely
39:21 overachievers
39:22 it just seems awful they don't get a
39:25 chance to talk to their parents much
39:26 because their parents work too much and
39:28 so their counter move is to go mental be
39:31 like those folks yeah I'm not sure what
39:33 I want to be but I don't want to be one
39:34 of those folks sometimes you find your
39:38 loved life and then you start to shut
39:40 out the voices you start to shut out
39:43 anyone who is indoctrinating you because
39:45 you're in total control you have
39:48 everything that you need to be
39:49 absolutely elated every single minute of
39:51 the day for the most part for at least
39:53 giant stretches in your life years and
39:56 years of your life right I think as a
40:00 human being we should want that for all
40:03 of the fellow human beings as well as
40:05 ourself right and even if you can't get
40:09 it yourself at this particular time in
40:11 your life but you couldn't give it to
40:13 somebody else right you can refer a
40:16 friend to a friend couple things happens
40:19 right one you take one more human off
40:22 the list of being unhappy and lazy to if
40:26 they're your friend and they're gonna go
40:28 a place where you'd like to be right
40:29 well maybe they'll come back and send
40:32 you a postcard to come visit them and
40:33 they can get you in after they get in
40:36 maybe they're better than you currently
40:38 at what you're trying to do and so it's
40:41 going to give you an in and it's going
40:43 to give you some time to perfect what
40:45 you do right anyway I just want to say
40:48 they are Kim trailing the [ __ ] out of
40:50 Orange County in November of 2018 if
40:56 there's any type of big giant super fire
40:59 and Southern California I just want you
41:01 to remember this fact one of the things
41:04 that I think about when I think about
41:07 this people before us thing before I was
41:11 there for put into words was that my
41:14 parents and the people of their age
41:17 validate certain media types to be
41:21 absolutely pure and without error
41:25 magazines
41:27 of a certain caliber right if it's got a
41:29 posh name like the New Yorker posh
41:33 cartoons that the average Joe doesn't
41:35 get you got a bunch of inside references
41:38 or what have you within a cartoon they
41:40 feel better than someone else which is
41:43 really important for these people these
41:45 weak minded folks but anything is bound
41:48 in a hardback book for four centuries
41:53 the idea was that a publisher would do
41:56 its due diligence and take your book and
41:57 have it vetted by everyone in the planet
42:00 they can get its an expert on what
42:02 you're writing about you know even a
42:04 fictional book it's vetted for its story
42:06 quality its grammar all that kind of
42:09 stuff so by the time it gets to you it
42:11 is sort of a tome of all knowledge and
42:16 so if you hear something from someone
42:18 who was actually at a particular place
42:21 in time and you just get free
42:23 information directly from the source
42:25 right when you talk to these old school
42:29 folks they immediately poopoo
42:32 eyewitnesses because in their mind
42:34 they're gonna keep their mind open until
42:38 reuters ap same company owned by the
42:40 Rothschilds reports in to tell you what
42:43 it what really happened they're gonna
42:46 turn on their favorite television
42:47 channel watching their favorite
42:48 personality who's been a [ __ ] repeater
42:52 for 50 60 years right these folks that
42:55 pretend to be journalists like they'll
42:57 say well I'm a journalist oh really
42:58 Peter Jennings when's the last time you
43:00 got out there in the field and saw
43:01 something with your own eyes and then
43:03 wrote it down and supposedly your eyes
43:05 are better than my neighbor's eyes right
43:07 you could have a guy that watches a
43:09 building fall freefall it's 110 stories
43:12 it's completely an impossibility at the
43:14 bottom there's almost no debris because
43:16 the entire building atomized into a
43:18 pyroclastic cloud but a guy from CNN
43:22 will see it and tell you what happened
43:24 but your buddy who's got maybe two or
43:27 three PhDs in those realms from
43:31 metallurgy to structural architecture
43:33 the data they will have been there have
43:38 seen it happen with their own eyes and
43:39 then come back to you and go
43:40 well that's impossible then you report
43:44 that up a very valid resource right and
43:47 they'll tell you that those resources
43:49 that you know are fruitless because the
43:53 organization that would be otherwise
43:54 accused of creating the event told you
43:57 that they weren't at fault that it was
43:59 someone else's fault right we got a guy
44:02 roaming around the comments right now
44:03 who is so lost in that particular day
44:08 when that happened he is either a big
44:12 [ __ ] shill who was running around
44:13 trying to change everyone's mind posting
44:16 just links into like the most official
44:18 news crap you've ever seen in your life
44:21 but he is he if he's not a shill he's
44:24 one of these guys he's one of these guys
44:25 he was like I am a coward I will not
44:28 look at the truth because that means I
44:30 gotta [ __ ] get off my lazy ass and
44:31 put some skin in the game right he is
44:35 totally hugging the little doll of those
44:40 people that came before him right now
44:44 you guys heard me say this a lot
44:46 recently but when I was debriefed
44:50 informally of course by two
44:53 acquaintances that work for NASA who had
44:56 recently resigned within the last three
44:59 years both of them different times but
45:01 within the last three years both of them
45:02 got out both of them extremely brilliant
45:05 I think when I'm at a PhD now that I'm
45:09 now that I think back about it because I
45:11 remember we had a roomful of PhD people
45:13 it's really funny and but here I am
45:17 getting debriefed from the source right
45:20 that guys that participated in 1969
45:23 through 72 know they were kids too
45:25 they were watching that [ __ ] on TV trust
45:27 me but these folks were on the inside
45:30 looking for just the official stuff they
45:33 just give me the official schematics and
45:34 all go and help the Mars project build a
45:37 new platform to get further and deeper
45:38 into space kept looking kept looking
45:42 couldn't find anything finally pulled
45:43 aside told one of them was really pulled
45:46 aside the other one I don't think was
45:47 pull aside but they both quit because
45:50 they realized their jobs were gonna be
45:54 pointless they were gonna have to move
45:56 because the base that they were on the
45:58 NASA base they were on was being shut
45:59 down as I remembered
46:01 so it was reason to question their
46:06 career but when I was like cheese I'm
46:07 not gonna be really doing anything in my
46:09 lifetime [ __ ] this man I'm gonna go do
46:11 something one of them one I don't
46:13 remember I lost track to him almost
46:16 immediately we worked together for a
46:18 year after that but the other one I work
46:20 for another year with he would often
46:23 make gobs of bucks because of his brain
46:25 cells okay but I will sit with the baby
46:29 boomer and try to share that information
46:34 and when I hear them talk and I know
46:38 you've had this happen right while I
46:40 hear them talk I hear the words coming
46:42 out of their mouths and they are
46:44 repeating something that they heard from
46:47 mass media almost 95% of what they say
46:50 is just sound bites from mass media and
46:52 they actually think that they're forming
46:53 their own thought in their minds but
46:56 they're not having an original thought
46:57 at all right I'm not sure they can which
47:02 is interesting right well they think
47:04 they can oh my god they think they're
47:06 absolutely world experts on everything
47:09 they have a good memory for repeating
47:12 again they're smart but not intelligent
47:14 they don't deduce anything they don't
47:17 invent anything they just repeat and
47:20 what's interesting about those people is
47:23 that they typically have very low
47:25 self-esteem and very low self-confidence
47:28 even though they are trying to portray
47:31 the antithesis of that in public oh no
47:34 no I know I'm very smart
47:36 just watch me to show you right history
47:40 we now know I believe we can now say we
47:44 know it's so convoluted and so revised
47:48 that unless we can crack open some
47:55 building somewhere and find the fairly
47:59 believable source all right something
48:02 that maybe correlates with the
48:03 correlates with observed reality where
48:05 we can take a book from
48:06 you know the vatican's basement it's
48:08 probably got Alexander's library down
48:09 there and we could pull something out
48:11 and they tell us where the real
48:12 Jerusalem was and and where Troy was and
48:16 we can wear Lantis was and we can just
48:18 build there and we start seeing all the
48:19 footprints on the bottom of the ocean or
48:21 whatever and unless that happens a
48:25 mankind has been well but this way we
48:29 haven't yet reached a point where our
48:32 history is recorded properly accurately
48:37 we have a fleeting moment right now and
48:40 I'm not sure humanity understands how
48:43 absolutely powerful this moment is right
48:46 now as of 2018 if q and on is real which
48:54 jesus christ that guy promises a lot of
48:56 [ __ ] but if he's real and we get we
49:00 actually are able to conquer a big big
49:03 chunk of this evil however that's done
49:07 okay death punishment incarceration or
49:10 all the above and then we couldn't
49:13 eventually boil this up to the people so
49:15 that we can stop repeating history one
49:17 of the one of the ridiculous things that
49:19 Q keeps saying is that you know a bunch
49:22 of this will never be revealed to the
49:23 public because it's too horrific really
49:27 really that's a movement for [ __ ]
49:29 justice and the American Way
49:31 anyway anywhere on planet Earth I think
49:33 that's a complete line of [ __ ] right
49:36 you know unless you had a magic wand
49:38 which they don't to get rid of these
49:42 people then we need to know if there's a
49:46 cartel of human traffickers setting in
49:49 the middle of your hometown and but they
49:52 don't want to tell you that your kid
49:53 could be kidnapped in any one moment by
49:55 the Podesta brothers they don't want to
49:58 they don't want to tell you cuz it might
50:00 hurt your feelings it might scare you at
50:01 night right and so they're just letting
50:04 you play the lottery with every single
50:05 day of your life while they know exactly
50:07 where everyone is and they never go in
50:09 those locations
50:13 I don't know how humanity recaptures
50:16 history I thought about making an
50:17 episode on it but I would need to deep
50:19 dive into some of the areas of history
50:21 that I find very fascinating and bring
50:23 some case studies such that you're not
50:25 bored to death I think that I can say
50:29 accurately to some degree and probably a
50:32 lot of you have had this as well you do
50:35 focus and have focus for years on all
50:38 the people before us some that are still
50:40 life and some most that are probably
50:42 long since gone when you find out that
50:46 history has been revised at almost every
50:48 single turn of course there's
50:49 disinformation to make us believe these
50:51 things so we don't trust anything
50:53 believe me they're hip to all the mind
50:55 games cuz they wrote the book on it okay
50:58 probably quite literally but as I've
51:01 lived the last again probably thirteen
51:05 years becoming woke at it extremely
51:08 unhealthy rate it really was an
51:13 unhealthy rate of which I was digesting
51:15 information probably pulling down you
51:18 know a bunch of distant foe at the same
51:19 time and I'm probably still full of some
51:21 of it hopefully lesson less each day you
51:28 start to lose your confidence in what
51:31 you thought was the way the world worked
51:34 who were the good guys who were the bad
51:36 guys who was a good presidents of your
51:38 country Prime Minister's Chancellor's
51:41 have you worshipped wars have you
51:44 worshiped wars like me a revered Wars I
51:47 should say not worship them but revered
51:49 wars that you thought were absolutely
51:51 legit you were on the right side those
51:54 people that died should have died your
51:58 people should have died you should have
51:59 been in the war in the first place and
52:01 then you find out oh my god maybe this
52:04 was the worst thing that we've done to
52:06 date it's a hell of a thing to reset
52:09 isn't it it's a hell of a thing to have
52:12 everything that you thought was legit
52:17 subtracted from your consciousness and
52:19 then you're sort of left in this
52:21 cautious void and I mean conscious void
52:24 and that you're aware that the history
52:27 that you were told was untrue and we
52:31 don't really cognitively if you're like
52:33 me realize how much comfort we get from
52:36 those moments you know when you're a kid
52:39 and this is something I meant to mention
52:40 earlier in this equation of the people
52:44 before us but when you're a little tiny
52:46 kid you know you could have the best
52:49 childhood on planet earth with very
52:50 really caring parents they're always
52:52 there for you if you're not I mean this
52:55 gets even more intense exponentially but
52:57 you have to grab a hold of language
53:01 process you know this is how we eat this
53:03 is how we how we excrete you know me
53:07 it's everything you have to get from
53:08 everyone that's that's a touch this is a
53:11 know touch this is this is what we call
53:13 entertainment this food is actually
53:14 considered good you're grappling at a
53:18 rapid pace so that you can control your
53:22 soul repentance reading into this
53:24 particular reality I mean look at a baby
53:28 that has to learn how to crawl they're
53:30 learning how to control this this
53:33 marionette that they're inside of so
53:38 it's no wonder we developed this
53:39 conscious habit to grab paradigms to
53:42 find comfort once you get back past the
53:46 strategic basics of eating sleeping and
53:49 what have you as a kid
53:52 you then move on to usually sex and
53:57 money sex because it's absolutely and
54:01 bred in us to procreate that's what
54:04 we're supposed to be doing save this
54:07 last probably five years with the 72
54:09 genders 70 of which that won't procreate
54:14 right is it funny most these gingers are
54:17 all about not procreating
54:19 well gender you hmm are you a procreate
54:22 or non-pro creator oh so you're those
54:24 other folks you know it's interesting
54:27 why do you go for money but because you
54:30 find out in some cases it contributes
54:33 heavily to your ability to get the first
54:35 thing
54:36 sex right once you want either of those
54:41 things we no longer live in little tiny
54:45 villages anymore in most places in the
54:47 world
54:47 some little towns in the Midwest and
54:49 Europe are essentially the same
54:52 qualification so you have very limited
54:53 scope of things if no one thinks they're
54:55 gonna leave the town they're gonna have
54:57 to pick from people inside then you just
54:59 simply do board goral boy-girl ratios
55:01 and you go hey man there's more girls
55:03 than boys I guess I got something to
55:05 pick from
55:06 but once you crawl inside that what
55:09 happens the people before you get to
55:12 control you like a mofo right and you
55:19 don't notice it at first do you you're
55:22 just mocking everything around you like
55:23 a little kid even though you might be 18
55:26 22 years old when you teach kids I
55:31 usually I usually almost exclusively
55:34 teach kids in college you know 18 and up
55:38 and my classes are usually the 18 to 22
55:42 you know realm but a lot of times
55:44 they'll be a guy or girl who's coming in
55:46 in their 30s or 40s changing their
55:49 career and it's very inspiring
55:51 those people really really inspire me
55:53 because they've realized it's never too
55:55 late and that's the truth pen it is
55:57 never too late you know if you want to
55:59 be a ballerina and you're 50 you may
56:03 have to go to a local ballerina you know
56:06 community center or something but for
56:09 the most part people could find
56:10 something that they love that they can
56:11 get at their age right but these kids
56:15 will have a level of insecurity that
56:18 almost baffles you right I see these
56:21 kids and I see the terror in their face
56:22 and a lot of the kids who come up to me
56:25 after class will say I need your help I
56:28 don't say why well I I love it here I
56:32 like the school
56:33 I like the opportunities but I'm not
56:35 sure which thing I want to do I'm like
56:37 okay and you know take all the
56:40 self-improvement courses I've heard
56:42 lectures I put on this show I go through
56:45 the whole process of what makes you tick
56:47 I forget about this place forget about
56:49 film and television and movies and all
56:51 that kind of stuff what makes you tick
56:52 do you like helping people do you like
56:54 creating things but blows you away do
56:57 you have a desire to blow other people
56:59 away or do you want to be a spectator in
57:01 the crowd maybe you're more of a critic
57:03 and a creator right I haven't been
57:06 stumped yet you know sometimes in order
57:09 to get the solution I refer them off to
57:10 a professional for the former employee
57:13 of mine or someone else who's doing what
57:15 they are interested in and they can go
57:19 and see the whole ecosystem of the job
57:21 what it's like to get up in the morning
57:22 and do that particular job right but now
57:27 that I think about it I think that the
57:30 insecurities that they've had is that
57:32 they've take they've they've gone to the
57:33 trough of the people before them too
57:35 much up to 18 up to 20 20 and 18 19 20
57:40 22 instead of building their own mind
57:43 and thinking for themselves they've been
57:46 going the easy route right I love
57:51 education so much like being educated
57:55 that one I wish I had two of me so one
57:58 could go off to school constantly and
58:00 then bring all the information a jacket
58:02 into the one it's actually doing the
58:03 work which is me but it wasn't until I
58:07 was probably in my early 30s that I met
58:09 someone who said they had a college
58:12 degree and they were a waitress at this
58:15 restaurant that I was helping to manage
58:17 at night when I was I would go there to
58:19 eat at night I've mentioned this place a
58:21 couple times in Italian restaurant
58:22 that's really sweet girl was working
58:24 there and she managed to mention we're
58:29 talking about raises and positions and
58:30 stuff and she's definitely one of the
58:32 more you know tenacious waitresses at
58:34 the time she just did this anymore at
58:36 all she's got a great career but at the
58:38 time I think I think she was like 19 20
58:40 years old somewhere in there and she
58:42 said I said what she goes she said she
58:45 had a degree and I go would you get a
58:46 degree in she goes psychology I said Wow
58:48 really because you know I studied
58:50 psychology like crazy crazy crazy and I
58:54 said well I guess you didn't go on to
58:57 get your master's anything else what
58:59 made you stop and she said well I was a
59:02 soccer player
59:03 and so I took psychology because it was
59:06 rumoured well rumored by the coach to be
59:09 the easiest degree that you can get and
59:12 maintain an academic prowess right I
59:15 mean an athletic prowess excuse me and
59:19 right at that point because we should
59:21 back up one second we had another
59:22 waitress beautiful girl I think she was
59:26 18 she just gotten a full scholarship to
59:29 Pepperdine University and I mean
59:31 everything the room board food
59:33 everything she was I guess a really
59:35 really smart girl and she left us fairly
59:37 quickly we had her first summer and that
59:38 was it here she is the polar opposite of
59:43 the other one however the other one was
59:47 probably she's less than five feet tall
59:49 so her becoming a professional soccer
59:51 player was not in the game for her I
59:54 heard she was really good so the
59:58 long-term plan was not there get a
60:01 degree that's simply an ancillary thing
60:03 to be able to get the full ride through
60:06 the soccer game playing right soccer
60:09 scholarship and the other girl is
60:11 absolutely trying to become like a
60:14 doctor she's trying to become the best
60:16 of the best she knows exactly what she
60:19 wants to do right it was new to me that
60:23 anyone would go to school just for the
60:26 hell of it you know just to get the
60:28 degree because somebody says you have to
60:32 you know I went to college for probably
60:35 about two and a half years if you
60:36 combined all of my junior college stuff
60:39 that's about it but I enjoyed every
60:43 minute of it save a couple weird
60:46 teachers but I still enjoy the classes
60:48 even though some of the teachers made
60:49 tests that didn't match anything that
60:51 they were assigning us to read or teach
60:52 lecture wise and then they would
60:54 complain that everyone's doing bad on
60:55 the test I'm saying look at the gang on
60:57 it's because you suck as a teacher
61:00 pretty goddamn easy to tell a kid what's
61:03 gonna be on the test right I mean
61:04 subject wise right but that even has a
61:08 lesson on into itself that sometimes
61:11 you're going to have very formidable
61:13 obstacles that are going to keep you
61:15 from getting what you want right
61:16 so how can we change our minds just in
61:19 concluding this thing how do we change
61:21 your minds to gain more insight more
61:23 personal power to quote Tony Robbins
61:25 right I think and and I've said this in
61:30 different ways in season one several
61:32 times which is I have this analogy I
61:34 repeat every once in a while don't
61:36 believe I've said it in season four yet
61:38 so let's do it you have all these things
61:41 that you have learned over the course of
61:44 your life most things that you learn are
61:48 in one of three piles in your brain I
61:50 don't know of a fourth please share one
61:52 if you have a fourth you got your truth
61:55 pile you got your false pile and you
61:58 ever maybe pile I like to think of this
62:02 as like a pantry a big giant pantry in
62:04 your house and if you've any if any of
62:07 you have seen those hoarding shows what
62:09 do they do with hoarding houses that are
62:10 really bad they take everything outside
62:13 they throw all that refuse away all the
62:15 dead cats and dogs and then they clean
62:18 up the whole house as best they possibly
62:19 can and then they make the person give
62:22 up as much of the stuff on the yard as
62:24 it possibly can and then they put the
62:26 whatever's left back inside hopefully
62:28 more organized right I think as children
62:32 the more insecure we are meaning either
62:34 the less the inference in individuals
62:37 providing the valid information to us
62:39 right you might have someone who's
62:41 completely wrong all the time giving you
62:42 bad advice and it always hurts you and
62:44 so you cut them off but they're your
62:46 main source right if you have a bad
62:48 parent or bad Guardian any like Jesus
62:50 where can I get to the information that
62:52 works right but a routine basis we have
62:57 to take everything out of the pantry and
63:00 you got your big giant shelves that are
63:03 true your false and your maybe is kind
63:06 of a table in the middle like a big
63:07 island in the middle of the pantry it's
63:10 important that anything that's
63:12 significant to you in life and I mean
63:14 anything the definition of love the
63:16 definition of the value of work how to
63:18 be a parent that'll be the best wife or
63:20 husband or partner whatever super
63:25 scientists whatever you have to take
63:27 everything out and have the courage well
63:29 the courage to do that and have the
63:30 courage to bring everything back in and
63:31 reevaluate it with your current
63:33 knowledge provided by the observable
63:35 universe don't worry about the people
63:38 before you use your brain don't worry
63:42 about smarts right all that you know
63:45 repeated crap that you memorize out of
63:49 books make sure those things that you
63:51 are have read in books are out there on
63:53 the pile the rules by which you evaluate
63:57 things is also the stuff that you have
64:00 to evaluate constantly which is why it's
64:02 extremely important to become
64:04 intelligent because that is the part of
64:06 your brain that will immediately engage
64:08 when you have to evaluate something with
64:11 your own mind right how many of you have
64:15 done a massive change in your life from
64:17 something you thought was extremely
64:18 important and later you just look back
64:22 and you go man I don't know why I was
64:24 like that why did I think that that was
64:25 so important it was so not important in
64:28 fact maybe you know all of us are guilty
64:30 of this we missed out on part of our
64:33 childhood part of our decade of your
64:36 life your 20s your 30s or 40s whatever
64:38 because you prioritize something too
64:42 much a lot of for a lot of guys it's
64:44 video games you played too many games
64:47 and maybe if you can play games that
64:49 make you a better person in reality than
64:51 in the end it was worth it so if you've
64:55 ever divorced yourself from a particular
64:58 behavior then you have the mechanism in
65:00 your mind to evaluate something so maybe
65:03 you did it for something less serious
65:05 and now you can do it for something
65:06 serious or maybe you did it for
65:07 something serious and now you can do it
65:09 for something less serious but in the
65:11 end you begin to become the person that
65:13 you want to be and if you're uncertain
65:16 about something then great you can go on
65:19 a on a Dagobah boon mission to find out
65:23 the information that you think you need
65:25 to make a better intelligent evaluation
65:28 of the things that are in the maybe pile
65:30 that were previously on either of a true
65:32 pile or the false pile every single
65:36 person I've ever met or ever heard about
65:38 that ever
65:40 defeated racism and doctrine aided
65:44 racism from their youth they've always
65:47 said the same story
65:48 well my grandparents were really racist
65:50 my parents are really racist and I grew
65:53 up racist up to a point until I had an
65:55 experience with someone of that race and
65:57 it was extremely pleasant and I realized
65:59 this was the most ridiculous thing I
66:02 ever believed or what these people were
66:05 bad people because of the way they their
66:07 genetics were put together how much
66:08 pigment they have in their skin stupid
66:11 right I mean it's a great thing that you
66:14 figured this stuff out but somehow and a
66:17 lot of cases we take those big giant
66:19 broad-stroke kind of Note moments and
66:24 then we don't bring it back to a finer
66:25 tuna valuation of everything else in our
66:27 life so let me give you another analogy
66:30 that might help inspire you if you're
66:32 still struggling if I said to you hey
66:38 you I'm a very very wealthy eccentric
66:42 person I have set aside I think what
66:47 what I have allocated is an undeniable
66:50 amount of money that will allow you to
66:53 take your current home that you live in
66:54 let's say you have a home and you can
66:58 throw everything away that you want out
67:01 of that house your TV your beds your
67:04 nightstands the light fixtures the paint
67:07 on the wall the wallpaper on the wall
67:09 well paint on the outside of your house
67:11 whatever you can throw it all the way
67:13 and I will go in and I will give you
67:16 excuse me I will give you this big chunk
67:20 of cash and I will provide you with any
67:23 resources that you need to get what you
67:25 want and you can completely redo that
67:27 house floors ceilings everything even
67:31 the clothes you put on your back could
67:33 be completely different I'll get you a
67:34 full makeover how exciting is that sound
67:38 oh wait a minute there's a show this is
67:40 move that bus that used to exist I don't
67:41 exist anymore
67:42 that was so inspiring that we had you
67:46 know how many like home makeover shows
67:48 on TV at one point in time I think there
67:50 at one point timers over a dozen
67:53 in fact I just saw an article of one of
67:55 the carpenters who's utterly famous from
67:58 one of these little teeny tiny shows or
68:00 I think he's probably making maybe a few
68:02 thousand bucks per episode
68:03 that guy's probably worth hundreds of
68:05 thousands of dollars if not millions why
68:08 am I going on about this well in this
68:11 particular episode that house is your
68:14 brain that house is all the circuitry
68:17 that you have manifested in and hooked
68:20 together inside your mind to evaluate
68:22 who you are as a human being it's all
68:26 the circuits that have made you who you
68:27 are today you know they always say that
68:29 you're a product of all your thoughts
68:30 right I'm giving you the ability I'm not
68:36 trying to take credit for anything but
68:37 I'm just trying to say this conversation
68:39 is about you having the ability to
68:42 reengineer who you are as a human being
68:44 such that you can wake up tomorrow or
68:46 two minutes from now and be a completely
68:50 different person that's way more in line
68:52 with who you feel that you are inside a
68:57 lot of times people get stuck in really
69:00 bad ruts and they just they just are
69:02 creatures of habit I'm a creature of
69:03 habit I try to make really good habits
69:06 but I got my vices of course what would
69:10 happen if you were able to get rid of
69:12 like one of the little demons that was
69:14 on your shelf in your pantry that it's a
69:17 habit that you had but you didn't want
69:20 to have it but you couldn't figure out a
69:23 way to get rid of it Tony Robbins tries
69:26 to teach you a thousand different ways
69:28 to demonize that thing that you hate but
69:31 that you do it anyway and then he tries
69:34 to take the the vision of you at the end
69:37 result of what you want to be and he
69:41 tries to take it from an apparition a
69:43 fleeting thought that just goes through
69:45 your mind yak oh I just want that thing
69:47 I want to be that thing and he says then
69:49 I'll grab it here's how you grab it boom
69:51 now pull it really close now look at it
69:54 don't look at anything else just look at
69:55 the thing that you want to be and focus
69:58 on it what's the hottest commodity and
70:01 2018 in terms of mental commodities
70:07 it's again it's a thing that we all lust
70:10 for nowadays especially if you're
70:12 watching this show but now it's a thing
70:15 that could be used against us and it is
70:16 being used against us as well
70:18 with the commodity is truth with a
70:22 capital T which means the truth if
70:26 anything can be labeled with a capital T
70:28 it is by its writer considered to be an
70:32 absolute why were you denied the capital
70:37 T truth in any category of life it's
70:41 because the people will force either
70:45 through evil intent or absolute sheer
70:48 ignorance we're all ignorant of more
70:52 things than we're probably smart about
70:55 but hopefully those things are
70:58 irrelevant to our life and out of our
70:59 circle of life right
71:01 I am definitely ignorant about what 99%
71:07 of the surface of this planet looks like
71:09 about the cultures that exist on those
71:12 surface points but I keep my circle when
71:17 the one that I travel in I'm very
71:19 well-informed I think I don't know about
71:22 you but I'm pretty excited about this
71:24 revelation to clarify my past that has
71:29 inspired me down to individuals and I
71:33 think that it's important to to think
71:37 about it as people instead of this
71:39 ambiguous Gestalt that's out there right
71:42 this big kind of vaporous apparition is
71:46 called history way too often I think as
71:51 well it's also important for us to focus
71:52 on the fact that we typically demonize
71:54 people that are that have earned that
71:58 that label they are evil people and then
72:03 we have our second kind of a second tear
72:05 down of people that are very
72:09 complicit to being ill-informed but
72:13 maybe there's a bigger section of folks
72:16 but have no association with those other
72:19 two groups they are not trying to be
72:20 evil under any circumstance right damn
72:27 keep it down up there guys the whole
72:30 notion of the kind of rebuilding your
72:33 house if you were a hoarder thing and
72:35 some people do it and they're not
72:36 hoarders is that you can't usually look
72:40 at a huge chaotic mess
72:41 and unless you're autistic you can't
72:43 count it all you can't get a grasp of
72:46 the categories that things belong in so
72:48 a lot of people when they live in dirty
72:50 homes they become very stressed out just
72:53 by the vision of their home now some
72:56 people obviously feel very comfortable
72:57 with that kind of stuff and that blows
73:00 my mind but we don't have to know where
73:03 all the negative influences are that are
73:05 coming into us every single day if we
73:08 have the courage and the capability of
73:10 just for at least a little while cutting
73:12 them all off I just simply say anyway
73:14 you know what I'm gonna listen to anyone
73:16 else for a little while I'm gonna listen
73:17 to me and again I have that little gut
73:20 feeling of what is right and what is
73:22 wrong it's sort of a gift from the
73:25 universe you know when you think about
73:26 things you feel bad when you think
73:28 you're good things you feel good right
73:30 you know you'll meet people that do
73:32 self-destructive things right they have
73:34 addictions and they'll tell you all I
73:36 feel good when I'm on this drug or I
73:38 feel really good when I'm doing this
73:39 very dangerous thing but usually if you
73:43 get them calmed down and room sobered up
73:45 or whatever and they really start
73:47 reflecting on their life they'll admit
73:50 it it's not good for them and then they
73:54 start to admit how they got addicted to
73:55 it the stages of addiction and this
73:59 isn't horrific drug taking or anything
74:01 like that I mean it could be that but it
74:03 could just be real basic things so let
74:06 me give you a few things and then I'll
74:07 cut out of this this video a few
74:10 categories that I personally find
74:13 extremely important for me personally
74:15 right maybe you agree time management is
74:19 the most important thing in my life
74:22 what am I doing with every waking moment
74:24 that I'm alive
74:25 I definitely consciously insert past
74:32 times things where I'm not actually
74:34 doing anything super intense I play a
74:38 video game has no value there's nothing
74:41 I'm learning from the video game at my
74:43 age that I need to be doing this it's
74:46 just completely stupid but it's just
74:48 inserted in the day to create a little
74:50 bit of a low hum you know and I
74:53 obviously play games that appeal to my
74:55 instinct of being a human being I've
74:59 said it a couple times I'll say it again
75:01 because he's out there posting a lot on
75:05 Instagram lately but the reason my own
75:10 these microphones and that machine is
75:12 because of a project I had with LL Cool
75:15 J his obsession is the word focus and
75:22 it's one thing to hear that and you have
75:25 to apply it in certain methodologies to
75:28 make it actually happen an instinctual
75:30 value to you right focus in my opinion
75:33 is all about time management get up get
75:36 out of bed don't sit in bed don't take a
75:39 bunch of drugs that keep you in bed
75:41 right every single moment that you're
75:45 alive you could be creating something or
75:46 doing something that is coming literally
75:49 from your heart and it will not feel
75:52 like work because it is something that's
75:54 from your heart
75:56 again I've said at previous episodes but
75:58 if you have a job you don't like and you
76:00 want to change jobs well probably the
76:02 best thing you do is secure the one that
76:03 you have do really good at it so you're
76:05 not on any target and then go find the
76:08 one that you want and take your time
76:10 find a good employer find it close to
76:12 your house make sure it's a good company
76:14 look into their financials you know but
76:17 you don't have to go that intense
76:20 everyone in life has a to-do list
76:22 that they need to take care of you know
76:24 fortunately if you live anywhere those
76:28 things get dirty right homes get dirty
76:30 you got to clean them up all the time
76:32 it's a pain in the ass
76:33 some of us
76:35 have the natural instinct to just clean
76:37 as they go through their house some
76:38 people my friends I'll go over we're
76:41 having a three-hour conversation and the
76:43 entire time I'm talking to them they're
76:44 sponging zuv the now wiping something
76:46 down drying something off they place is
76:48 immaculate a little bit that freaks me
76:51 out because I don't be that obsessive
76:52 but you know what I'm saying right I
76:54 think about the word focus all the time
76:56 now
76:59 anytime you go through a transition your
77:02 routines are disturbed and sometimes
77:04 you'll go from being highly focused
77:05 highly productive to like total
77:07 confusion chaos little disorientation it
77:10 takes a while sometimes it takes months
77:12 sometimes to make it may take a couple
77:13 years but every day that you chip a
77:16 little bit away at that obstacle it
77:19 eventually disappears or falls apart
77:20 when you get around it easily and it
77:23 becomes an innate skill that you're
77:25 really good at so you ever hit that
77:26 obstacle again it's like that one little
77:27 coup de Gras and it's gone right the
77:32 other one is human interaction very very
77:35 important I don't think anyone really
77:37 likes being alone I think sometimes life
77:41 makes being with others rather difficult
77:45 at that point you need to well this is
77:50 what I do this is what I do I try to
77:52 pick friends that really enlightened me
77:56 bring something I haven't thought of
77:58 before or maybe I'm helping them usually
78:03 it's the other way around
78:04 usually they help me and one way or the
78:05 other that make me laugh or they make me
78:08 see a movie or a special or documentary
78:11 or we have a conversation about
78:12 something that I bring to you in a video
78:14 right this whole video is based on one
78:17 little conversation that happened but
78:20 the other one for me
78:21 in closing really this time is my
78:25 deathbed analysis of my life it's a hell
78:30 of a thing to wake up in the middle of
78:32 your life having been very proud of the
78:35 things that you've done but realizing on
78:37 your deathbed the evidence of your
78:40 existence will be minimal at best
78:45 and so the way I have boiled that down
78:49 is to simply say if what I do doesn't
78:52 make me a better person or make someone
78:54 else a better person like enriching
78:56 someone else's life passing the
78:58 knowledge down right then maybe I'm
79:01 doing the wrong thing and that means you
79:05 can be totally selfish with the phase of
79:07 your life because you're improving you
79:09 which then after you've done it you can
79:11 improve other people but you have to
79:13 pick your friends carefully and that is
79:17 something that I've covered in the
79:18 friendship episode which no one watches
79:20 but it's extremely important I mean I'm
79:22 telling you the amount of people that I
79:24 have met personally that need to watch
79:25 that episode is too numerous to keep
79:28 track of but every once in a while
79:31 you'll see a very meet a very successful
79:33 person and you'll realize that they
79:36 don't hang out with anyone who isn't
79:38 enlightening that brings them a very
79:42 needed deep-rooted laughs it's very
79:45 genuine we inherit our friends from our
79:49 walk of life initially you're stuffed
79:52 into school after school after school
79:53 you have a neighborhood you have family
79:56 friends and you hopefully love them and
79:59 you can keep them your whole life and
80:00 they're your crew they're your rock
80:02 right sometimes you get a few stragglers
80:05 in there people who are really
80:07 well-adjusted when they were younger but
80:10 not so much today they hanging on the
80:14 old patterns and you might need to cut
80:18 them out for a little while it might be
80:20 that you cutting them out gives them the
80:23 mother of invention to change their own
80:25 life I used to say this phrase all the
80:28 time it's a hell of a thing to be a man
80:30 but I definitely have been made more
80:32 sensitive to the gender specific
80:35 orientation of that statement I would
80:37 say it's a hell of a thing to be a human
80:40 being and really grow up you know very
80:43 close friend of mine said that the one
80:45 of the most courageous things you can
80:46 ever do is get old and deal with a loss
80:50 of your faculties over time when you
80:52 used to when you're used to them being
80:54 there and when they are your faculties
80:56 maybe being able to see
80:58 eight being able to walk around at will
81:01 because eventually we lose the mechanics
81:04 of our body don't we I think a lot of us
81:07 are on that pilgrimage to find the truth
81:11 to find ourselves to find each other to
81:13 find a filter a paradigm of which we can
81:16 interact with each other and have the
81:18 most pleasant experience our children
81:22 our spouses our neighbors people on the
81:25 Internet
81:27 hopefully this episode helps hopefully
81:29 you feel me in this one I know this
81:32 episode kind of wandered around a little
81:33 bit but I really honestly think it's
81:36 valuable to look at things from all the
81:39 minutiae all the tiny little fine-tuning
81:43 aspects of our thought process so that
81:45 we can really dig down inside because
81:47 once you've had listened to an hour and
81:49 a half of a concept versus a five-minute
81:51 shortened video of you know here's the
81:54 list of things you do to make your life
81:55 better
81:56 yeah I think that stuff is forgotten
81:58 just as quickly as it is it's heard
82:00 because it never really digs any roots
82:02 down inside your system and maybe the
82:05 one analogy that is given in this short
82:07 video it doesn't make any sense to you
82:11 but going through four or five or a
82:14 couple dozen iterations of it from
82:17 different perspectives you catch the
82:18 fish that you need to eat to make your
82:22 mind better right let's sort of what I'm
82:24 trying to do on these episodes that are
82:25 more esoteric anyway if you haven't been
82:29 to deep thoughts radio.com
82:30 please go there's audio video a locked
82:32 Facebook group and a patreon page again
82:35 you guys have been fantastic we have
82:37 over 300 new subscribers so I'm sure
82:40 they're in a bit of a shock now that I'm
82:42 not talking about the moon but hopefully
82:44 with the previous episodes I can keep
82:45 them entertained until like-minded
82:48 episodes come back up I am planning a
82:51 lot more of that content this this
82:52 season because I think there's a lot
82:53 more to dive into I'm having to do some
82:55 research to get my next moon episode put
82:58 together so I'm gonna have to go through
83:00 some very specific stuff so stay tuned
83:02 but anyway take care of yourself and
83:05 someone else I'll see in the next deep
83:06 thoughts over now
83:09 [Music]
83:17 you
