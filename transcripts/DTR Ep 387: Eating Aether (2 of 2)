00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:33 gentlemen it's a night I'm gonna try a
00:36 different angle I forgot I got another
00:37 light back here which might come in
00:41 handy and making these not so dark so
00:46 tonight at tonight's episode is sort of
00:49 one for me it's always episodes where
00:52 I'm thinking through a theory and I
00:55 thought I'd just think out loud again
00:57 instead of going into my notebooks and
00:59 writing it all out which I probably
01:01 should do but it takes more time to do
01:03 that I'm just gonna put it into an
01:05 episode and it's a concept I've been
01:09 mulling over for about a week to two
01:11 weeks and it's called eating ether and
01:15 it really comes down to the notion that
01:17 because we've had the concept of ether
01:20 completely removed from our science
01:23 books we don't incorporate it into what
01:26 we do and I think that's a problem
01:30 because it's not a big problem but it's
01:32 just one of these things where were
01:34 stifled and we don't think of ourselves
01:37 as one with the universe except in
01:39 metaphysical ways now we're trying to
01:42 stay healthy and we're trying to find
01:44 almost a unified theory for how to stay
01:46 healthy
01:46 and I think that most of you know that
01:50 when you go back to some sort of Paleo
01:55 diet you are dealing with the notion
01:58 that hey the earth is made of so many
02:02 chemicals and so many elements and
02:05 compounds and all these different things
02:06 and we are made from the earth and so we
02:13 really just need to get back to the
02:14 basics of how man
02:16 initially came to be on this planet now
02:23 we could have a large debate about
02:24 whether or not it's creationism
02:26 evolution or alien drop-off which is a
02:29 combination of any number of the
02:30 previous ones I think what we can say
02:33 regardless of any one of those theories
02:35 is that were here and we've been here
02:38 for a very long time
02:39 a very long time way longer than perhaps
02:44 biblical 5000 year theories would
02:47 suggest which for me is the more
02:50 ludicrous closed-minded Christian thing
02:54 right there I don't know of other
02:56 religions by that whole thing but I
02:59 think we've been here for a long time I
03:00 think the you know the records left
03:04 behind by the Babylonians and the Egypt
03:06 Egyptians alone prove we've been here
03:08 for a very long time very long time if
03:12 you go back to this sort of homeopathic
03:17 pel√©an diets where we're really eating
03:20 from the earth we're not eating anything
03:22 that's processed anything this
03:23 synthesized it's all-natural all-natural
03:26 all-natural we don't allow ourselves to
03:29 consume things that have been
03:32 genetically modified that would
03:33 otherwise be the things that we'd want
03:35 to eat we don't allow our cows to be
03:38 mess with our chickens to be mess with
03:40 any livestock we're consuming none of
03:42 that gets messed with and it's pretty
03:46 obvious that if we control our exposure
03:50 to things like you know man-made
03:53 radiation man-made this and that then we
03:56 can get back to what we used to be I
03:58 think it'd be interesting if we had a
04:01 blackout that lasted 12 hours in the
04:05 night at some particular location on
04:07 earth like the big New York blackout
04:08 instead of a bunch of you know
04:11 primitives running around looting the
04:14 entire city everyone just relaxed and
04:17 went to bed and listened to how easy it
04:20 wasn't of course back then there wasn't
04:22 a lot of I mean there was television and
04:23 radio but imagine everything was muted
04:26 in Los Angeles and all surrounding
04:29 counties for some reason not that I want
04:31 this to occur okay but if it were to
04:33 occur and we actually had the difference
04:36 between what it was like to live a day
04:39 without electricity and then you know
04:43 all the emissions are down cellphone
04:45 towers don't work nothing works and
04:48 we're living in a perfectly balanced
04:50 world as we did perhaps 200 years ago
04:54 how calm would we feel how many people
04:57 would dream that had never dreamed
04:58 before how many people who dream would
05:01 dream spectacular things maybe dreams
05:04 would go away for a day who knows but
05:07 maybe you'd wake up four hours later
05:09 feeling like you had 12 hours of sleep
05:11 because it was that good your Delta and
05:15 your beta phases were just as pure as
05:17 they could possibly be if we go back to
05:20 the chemical notion of trying to
05:23 streamline your diet back to the
05:27 founding moments of humanity when it
05:30 used to be really well balanced now that
05:33 the if you go back in history the way to
05:36 think about this is that we didn't
05:39 travel initially we were raised in a
05:43 particular area we spent hundreds if not
05:45 thousands of years in a particular
05:47 region where our tribe was essentially
05:51 pounding the pavement trying to you know
05:54 it's a bad analogy cuz it's a futuristic
05:56 substance but you know we were
05:58 harvesting the agriculture in our area
06:01 we were eating the livestock in our area
06:03 anyone who couldn't handle those
06:05 nutrients died off and so we ended up
06:08 getting the best of the best we married
06:12 our own kind and so all the geometry of
06:15 our bodies was very succinct I imagine
06:18 we had probably perfect eyesight a
06:20 tremendous amount of our diseases
06:23 although not fatal but some of the
06:25 diseases that can occur when you mix
06:28 different regions of the worlds together
06:30 and I'm not saying we shouldn't do this
06:32 nowadays because we've got medicine to
06:33 get around this and we understand it
06:35 better but there are consequences for
06:38 mixing different races together
06:41 initially and then we all balance out
06:43 and I think we've done this quite a lot
06:46 quite a while so I don't know for past
06:48 this whole thing if we gained sicknesses
06:50 that wouldn't occur if we hadn't moved
06:53 around but imagine you leave the valley
06:56 that you're from you leave the plains
06:58 that you're from the mountains that
06:59 you're from the deserts this the
07:01 rainforest that you're from and now you
07:04 are in a different region you were in a
07:07 maybe a warm climate and you move to a
07:09 cold climate you were in a cold climate
07:10 you move to a warm climate well your
07:13 body your skin everything about that has
07:16 now been undone you're no longer
07:20 resilient necessarily to the elements
07:23 you might be constantly cold if you move
07:26 from warm to cold you might be
07:27 constantly hot if you move from cold to
07:30 hot but now this episode is about eating
07:34 ether and it really comes down to a very
07:39 basic principle that we are the
07:42 amalgamation of God knows how many
07:45 little orbital ether ol particles that
07:49 have created essentially the force field
07:52 that is who we are the ether itself
07:55 falls through us just like wind through
07:58 a sheet hanging in the wind you know
08:01 like a river that never is just there a
08:06 river is constantly moving right a river
08:09 is constantly making an ocean constantly
08:11 makes waves but the wave that just came
08:13 in will never exist again but we are
08:18 more of a solid state being even though
08:20 we do have an ecosystem of things that
08:22 go through mitosis and regeneration we
08:27 pass our waste out of our body we
08:31 consume things and they melt into our
08:33 system and then what we can't use goes
08:36 out the the old ducts right well now
08:43 imagine if you were completely living in
08:48 the higher construct realm of
08:50 conversation you're trying to worry
08:52 about a carrot some water some meat and
08:56 you're always worried at that top level
09:00 that is one end of this conversation my
09:04 conversation from my mind is going back
09:06 to the very basics we are obviously
09:10 trying to consume things that aren't so
09:12 violent that our body gets injured that
09:15 what we are made out of doesn't get
09:17 knocked out of place because we are this
09:20 house of cards that is the plural of
09:25 ether all winds that have figured out a
09:29 way to orbit each other to create the
09:32 force fields necessarily you know these
09:35 they kind of get together and they they
09:38 coalesce into these spheres they either
09:41 have a spin one way or spend the other
09:42 way we typically call one way the
09:44 positive and one way the negative some
09:48 things are going to attract some things
09:49 are going to repel what's important I
09:53 think that we understand how this works
09:56 I've been recently experimenting with
09:59 the idea of grounding my body and it has
10:02 to do with putting your feet on the
10:04 ground on Earth's soil and I'll tell you
10:09 it is very powerful very soothing and
10:12 you know I can't see something has
10:15 changed in my body necessarily because I
10:17 just started doing it maybe a couple
10:18 months ago but I'll sit in this yard
10:21 that piece of grass right behind me
10:22 there depending on where the Sun is I
10:24 usually try to get in the Sun and I'll
10:26 take my shoes off or my sandals on where
10:29 my for whatever flip-flops they call
10:30 nutty thing my flip-flops off get my
10:32 feet right on the soil got my computer
10:34 in my lap and I'm working and I'll
10:39 notice that the second my feet hit the
10:40 soil whatever attention I had on my body
10:43 starts to melt I mean it's like candy
10:46 it's like your feet feel amazing the
10:48 second they hit soil I don't know if
10:50 it's exactly the same with sand because
10:52 sand is glass essentially rights a
10:55 little bit different I don't know if
10:57 sand has the grounding properties the
10:59 dirt has so I make sure I put it on
11:01 grass and dirt so I'm putting it on a on
11:04 a carpet of living beings called plants
11:08 that have their own consciousness
11:09 regardless if you realize it or not
11:11 they're all communicating with each
11:13 other in the world I think beautiful
11:16 thoughts towards all my plants and they
11:18 grow fantastically I got three rose
11:20 bushes going on me right now
11:21 got a couple plants I put in the ground
11:24 over there if any of you see the
11:26 original intros for two and three I
11:30 guess season two and three you'll see me
11:32 film this little potted plant area
11:34 and that's blossoming right now it's
11:37 awesome but now I'm thinking you know
11:41 can we understand a little more of the
11:43 physics of the human body and especially
11:44 the nutrients of our body our
11:47 consciousness how our body behaves I
11:50 mean because the thing is is imagine
11:52 this let me give you a race car analogy
11:54 because this should be a little easier
11:56 to understand the first thing you need
12:00 to do if you're gonna put a car on a
12:01 race is build the car and the car is
12:04 gonna have so much power so much
12:05 horsepower and grip and endurance you
12:12 know some cars are just built for drag
12:13 racing they go 315 miles an hour for a
12:17 matter of a few seconds and then they
12:18 are spent you got to rebuild the engine
12:21 everything is pulled away inside the
12:23 engine and then you have stock cars and
12:25 stock cars go in big circles and they're
12:28 meant to bang each other up and they're
12:31 a little more brutal open pipes
12:32 different then you have like your
12:35 Formula one cars super precise amazing
12:39 vehicles every single particle of air
12:42 has been considered it goes over this
12:44 thing from the hybrid engine that's in
12:47 the thing too
12:48 you know I mean everything is considered
12:51 but you have to build that car and it's
12:53 just gonna be in a garage you're gonna
12:54 stare at it and go that's a beautiful
12:56 car alright that's your body you just
13:00 have this body and it's sitting here
13:02 right now talking to you but now you
13:04 want to do a triathlon a marathon you
13:07 want to walk on the beach you want to
13:09 ride a bike you want to stand all day
13:12 for some reason well now you're gonna
13:14 put that car to the test
13:17 well now what happens when you race a
13:19 car on the track what are the elements
13:21 that the car designers are considering
13:23 they're considering the vector of which
13:27 this car is going to travel is it going
13:28 to go on a loop is it going to go in a
13:29 straight line is it gonna go through
13:31 some organic course this builds on the
13:33 way Monaco was laid out many many years
13:35 ago some design track and Dubai some
13:39 design track in China it's made for
13:41 racing then what is the ground made out
13:44 of is it asphalt is it cement
13:48 you know what are the corners made out
13:50 of it they really jagged corners that if
13:53 you hit them they're gonna start ripping
13:54 rubber off the tires how the tires meet
13:56 are they super soft so these super hards
13:59 what are they what should we put on
14:00 these things how do you configure the
14:02 gearbox to get the best possible lap
14:05 times the best possible straightaways
14:08 but you also have enough low gears to
14:10 get around corners all these things are
14:11 considered right the vibration is a
14:15 gigantic consideration with these cars
14:18 the engine just on is going to vibrate
14:20 the car the car going over certain
14:23 surfaces is going to shake the car so
14:26 you have to make sure that you know as a
14:28 Formula One raises like what 57 laps or
14:30 something like that it's going to have
14:32 to survive 57 iterations or 50-plus this
14:35 put that way of iterations through this
14:38 track of a particular custom type and so
14:41 they're trying to consider every element
14:43 of that well as we ingest food into our
14:48 system and oxygen and water and perhaps
14:52 even the intangible love and
14:55 consideration of other people the social
14:58 interaction of a human being all of
15:01 these things are going to contribute to
15:03 either our vehicle being injured or
15:06 perhaps our vehicle becoming stronger
15:11 now let's say you run a triathlon and
15:13 then you know you do it once a year but
15:17 you practice throughout the year when
15:18 the seasons are right but now you've got
15:21 to go to work and you work on the third
15:23 or fourth floor of a building you could
15:24 take the elevator but the elevator is
15:25 always full and you're sort of an
15:27 athletic person so you can take the
15:29 stairs every single day well guarantee
15:31 if you practice for a triathlon those
15:33 stairs are going to be pretty easy
15:34 aren't they but now think of every
15:37 single organ in your body and it's vital
15:41 role that it plays in your body now most
15:46 folks we get a little bit of Education
15:48 in high school about the digestive
15:50 system of the human body and I have to
15:53 say for my own sake I'm I'm very
15:57 disappointed that for whatever reason I
16:00 was not that
16:01 motivated to pay attention until way
16:03 into my 20s and 30s to figure out what
16:05 each organ did how it works etc etc so
16:09 that you have sort of an intimate
16:10 knowledge of how your body works as you
16:14 live your life because it it governs how
16:17 you're going to treat your body if they
16:20 told kids which they never do what
16:23 drinking alcohol does to your body why
16:27 do you get high and then what are the
16:29 repercussions of that whole process I'm
16:32 not sure any kid would ever drink
16:34 alcohol especially if you started him
16:35 off at 4 or 5 years old when they get
16:38 into high school show them all the crash
16:40 videos where drunk drivers have murdered
16:41 these families and say well this is what
16:44 you can look forward to if you lose
16:46 control this process oh sure it's built
16:49 into the society as a way to relax it be
16:51 intellectual if you know everything
16:53 about wine or scotches or whiskey's or
16:54 champagnes or whatever but if you take
16:57 it just the slightest bit past
16:59 moderation you're gonna start becoming a
17:02 bad statistic in society and depending
17:06 on how well you can control yourself on
17:08 this stuff or whether or not you build
17:09 up a dependency on this stuff your
17:11 ability to hold a relationship a
17:13 marriage together be a decent parent is
17:15 going to be negligible but they don't
17:19 tell you that every single time alcohol
17:21 hits your liver it kills cells and your
17:24 liver every single time you thin your
17:27 blood
17:27 anything that's relying on the
17:29 oxygenated blood and especially the
17:31 immune system it's going to suffer
17:34 you're not going to be as healthy I
17:36 think that's a big deal now of course we
17:41 want these things in our lives because
17:43 life is kind of hard right and so to get
17:46 high a little bit sort of provides a
17:48 little bit of relief I'm in that camp I
17:50 drink a beer what every time I eat
17:53 Indian food I drink an Indian beer it's
17:55 extremely light and I'm a light weight
17:56 anyway and I'm very proud of that if I
17:59 do karaoke at my local joint I I'll have
18:04 a whisky on ice I can only handle one
18:09 though because man after one I got a
18:11 headache
18:11 and I don't feel that great I can handle
18:15 one
18:16 I could be okay I do a double that's
18:17 actually where I start to get the
18:18 headache if I drink too I have lied to
18:22 myself about how my body works and what
18:24 it can actually handle and it's probably
18:28 because I don't invest a lot of of my
18:33 time in that but you're eating ether hmm
18:39 so at an atomic level or an ether level
18:42 which is the sub sub atomic level we are
18:46 essentially eating orbital particles
18:48 that are made of the same stuff that
18:50 we're made of but because the orbits
18:53 that these ether product goals actually
18:55 get to to be designated anything other
18:58 than a Puri through a particle they must
19:03 integrate with what we have built our
19:05 bodies out of right they must be
19:07 assimilated and dismantled their spins
19:11 have to be compatible with the spins
19:14 that are in our body either they can be
19:15 dismantled by other etheral orbits were
19:18 like the theory of a black hole and I've
19:22 done you have to understand I've done
19:24 massive massive research in black holes
19:27 so when I say they don't exist I'm not
19:29 just being neat jerky about the
19:30 situation or reactionary about it I have
19:33 written hundred page papers on black
19:35 holes okay but their their theory is
19:39 very interesting because it gives us
19:41 something that is barely explained in
19:44 any other fashion other than maybe if
19:47 you study the way bubbles might combine
19:50 or maybe how raindrops might roll down
19:53 and continue connecting to other
19:54 raindrops the idea of a black hole is
19:58 that it can only be a magnitude four to
20:01 twelve so four times our Sun size or
20:04 twelve times our Sun size anything below
20:06 that turns into like you know brown
20:08 dwarfs and you know stationary things
20:11 that don't turn into black holes
20:12 anything over that will continually
20:14 explode and sort of a supernova way and
20:17 so it can't become a black hole so the
20:19 way that they theorize and again it's
20:20 all horse crap is that you can get a
20:22 couple black holes together and because
20:25 they're already black holes they can
20:26 continually combine until they get to be
20:28 one gigantic black
20:30 and then of course they want to
20:31 terrorize you with this faux science
20:34 that you know the whole universe is
20:35 gonna get swallowed up by this thing or
20:36 the CERN Hadron Collider somehow has the
20:39 ability to pull that off which is so
20:41 ludicrous I can't even tell you men
20:42 slamming two protons together by no
20:46 means will ever affect an e Thurl
20:51 gravitational wave right it doesn't
20:53 create negative pressure any one point
20:55 time these things can't cave in on each
20:57 other and become something more dense
21:01 than what they were they're shattering
21:03 these things apart which is the exact
21:05 inverse of anything blocking ether winds
21:08 which would call that cause the negative
21:09 pressure to create a gravity wave of
21:11 some sort does it emit a giant
21:14 disturbance when they bang in these four
21:16 different colliders sure it's just like
21:19 an explosion on a subatomic level on a
21:22 subatomic level people so the idea is
21:25 think about the food that you're eating
21:27 and everything that you're metabolizing
21:30 from outer space which would be
21:31 essentially anything outside your house
21:33 or your body anything out here in the
21:35 windy area the unseen frequencies of
21:39 electricity are bombarding bombarding
21:41 your body their vibrational frequencies
21:44 well if your body's made of a bunch of
21:46 vibrating orbital etheral patterns which
21:51 are essentially dictating the shape of
21:54 your body the shape of your internal
21:55 organs every single cell in your body is
21:57 the amalgamation of probably called
22:00 drill Ian's times quadrillions of these
22:02 things making up what you are luckily
22:07 they are very strong in what they do
22:09 and so it is difficult to shatter a part
22:13 of human body with radio waves but one
22:19 thing they've done with directed-energy
22:20 weapons has figured out how to project
22:22 enough energy to be able to dismantle
22:27 certain levels of anything steel the
22:31 Hutchison effect the guy did where he
22:33 makes steel and wood together to things
22:35 that are completely polar opposites on
22:37 an each other level but when you go down
22:39 to an ether level everything is exactly
22:41 the same so combining those two things
22:43 makes
22:43 complete since you're resonating their
22:46 bonds to be less regimented on a atomic
22:53 species level so instead of being oil or
22:56 being water you could for a brief moment
22:59 as you're exerting this force on these
23:01 two substances theoretically speaking
23:03 you could get them to combine now since
23:07 you remove this secret geometry of
23:10 electricity on this object then it's
23:14 going to probably pull apart or become a
23:16 third thing that no one's ever seen
23:18 before
23:19 now if you study chemistry in the even
23:21 the lightest way there are things that
23:25 are compatible with each other and
23:26 things that aren't we have tons of metal
23:29 alloys right things that are made of
23:31 other things and that's how it happens
23:36 because they actually are capable of
23:38 being mixed together
23:40 you know what's the Bronze Age what is
23:43 it
23:43 copper in 10 I think those are the two
23:46 to go together to make bronze I think
23:47 that's right but we mix things together
23:50 to make new things there are these
23:54 theories that man lived a lot longer way
23:56 back in the day like 800 to a thousand
23:59 years well there's a lot of theories as
24:04 to why that happens some of the biblical
24:05 theories was that you know the how the
24:08 oceans came to exist that was due to the
24:11 fact that the ocean was over us in some
24:14 firmament layer and that at some point
24:17 it fell down to the earth perhaps
24:19 causing the big flood at some point I've
24:22 heard all kinds of wild theories and it
24:24 was that it was a layer of water over us
24:27 that protected us against the emissions
24:29 of the Sun or whatever the reason was
24:31 and it's like yeah that's nuts in my
24:33 opinion some of it could be again the
24:36 the idea that if you kept with the
24:38 nutrients and the agriculture and the
24:42 geographical location in which your
24:43 tribe formed on this planet and you
24:46 never deviated from the food supply food
24:50 was not a matter of entertainment food
24:51 was a matter of eating to satiate that
24:54 hunger in your stomach
24:56 then perhaps the degradation of our DNA
25:00 of our protein patterns of our
25:03 chromosome caps in caps all that stuff
25:06 stayed in in intact and so we could
25:09 potentially live a really long time I
25:10 don't actually have a giant problem with
25:13 that personally that being a potential
25:15 possibility you're watching today you
25:18 know you see these folks there's the the
25:22 black gentlemen here in America who I
25:24 think just passed away I think these
25:27 guys smoked a cigar every day he looked
25:30 great I mean he was a he was a Navy
25:32 veteran
25:33 there's definitely military like he was
25:35 Navy and he looked fantastic but most
25:39 people that hit a hundred in this world
25:41 you know we don't look so great or
25:43 especially our eye ball sockets look
25:44 really bad
25:45 and our eyes start to just you know
25:47 become dysfunctional definitely our
25:50 sentient sort of awareness and it's
25:54 probably 60 to 80 percent of the people
25:57 they get to get to 100 they're not quite
25:59 all there but now as we what's
26:02 interesting to me about this topic as we
26:05 reintroduce ether back into the lexicon
26:07 of man we refute these mathematician
26:13 physicists that live an absolute paper
26:16 fiction we bring it back because again
26:20 Tesla said look everything I've ever
26:22 done is based on how ether works period
26:25 and you know it again Mark Twain said
26:28 that when he went to Tesla's laboratory
26:30 all of his machines were powered by
26:31 electricity but he couldn't see a single
26:35 wire going into any of these machines
26:37 and one of the other things he said
26:39 about the laboratory was that the
26:41 ceiling had no lights up there but the
26:43 whole thing had a glowing cloud of light
26:45 he said you really couldn't even see a
26:47 cloud it was just it was lit up there
26:49 and he goes there was no light bulbs
26:51 pointed at the ceiling it just had this
26:54 light and it was like Tesla had a bunch
26:57 of inventions that he never exhibited
26:58 anywhere
26:59 perhaps they were dangerous perhaps
27:03 difficult to make maybe it was an
27:05 economical so never even mentioned to
27:07 anybody how these things work but these
27:09 are the
27:09 amazing things that this gentleman died
27:12 with having documented it and having
27:16 what is it Donald Trump's uncle who was
27:21 the I believe the head physicist at MIT
27:24 and Friends of Tesla actually was hired
27:27 by the FBI to go grab all the
27:28 information and sort through it so I
27:30 could go into the archives and now we're
27:32 saying that a man that died almost 80
27:36 years ago 90 years ago he his stuff was
27:41 so advanced that they're considered
27:44 matters of national security now
27:47 unbelievable this is a guy who based
27:51 everything on Ethan he's like look I'm
27:53 making inventions I'm making patents
27:55 your boy that said it didn't exist we
27:57 got a photoelectric patent he got
28:00 through the Nobel Prize then had to get
28:02 all those money to his ex-wife because
28:04 she's the one that actually metabolized
28:07 it out of probably stolen patents
28:08 somewhere so I want to bring this
28:11 material back into the biology of man I
28:16 want us to understand that if you really
28:19 look at ether a particles the notion
28:21 that they sit there and persist in your
28:23 body it's possible they could persist in
28:25 the body it's possible but when we look
28:27 at how electricity works we talked about
28:31 the valence the conductive valence on a
28:33 particular conductive material like a
28:34 wire made of copper made of gold and the
28:38 way that they describe it to you is how
28:42 the the cathode technique of going from
28:46 negative to positive it's it's like a
28:49 chain saw on the outside of a conductive
28:51 material they're swapping electrons like
28:54 a chain saw blade around the outside of
28:57 a valence of a conductive material okay
29:03 that sounds like they're playing sort of
29:06 hopscotch with all of the nuclear
29:07 material /ii thermal material that makes
29:11 up anything that exists in the universe
29:13 now lucky for us I think that most of
29:16 the ether in the universe passes
29:17 directly through us and never stops by
29:19 to become anything that we are
29:22 because there's so much space between
29:24 what we are so we have a lot of stuff
29:28 that bounces right through us and
29:31 probably bounces right through us and as
29:33 the dielectric wave off the center of
29:35 the Earth's plasma core it eventually
29:37 bounces back up a little bit of it will
29:40 escape back into space but a lot of it
29:42 goes into the bowels of the earth and
29:44 starts blowing us up like a balloon
29:46 where you get expanding earth I just
29:50 mentioned in the cancer episode
29:51 something called cell mimicry and the
29:55 first time I ever heard this was from a
29:56 guy named Greene his name was I guess gr
30:01 EE in maybe there's another a at the end
30:03 of his name but he was part of this
30:05 meatpacking company it was a
30:07 long-standing company I believe it's out
30:09 of Colorado and they were huge I mean I
30:13 I take it they must still exist if they
30:15 don't exist they must have sold
30:16 themselves off but he started saying
30:19 that the notion that we are what we eat
30:23 is much more intense on its on an atomic
30:25 level /e thorough level and that it's a
30:30 piece of science that's been hidden from
30:32 us so that we don't understand how we
30:35 become sick and how to remain healthy
30:37 but now why is it that a vitamin can be
30:41 good for you the vitamins that we
30:43 manufacture inside of our body like
30:45 vitamin D well you've got this pituitary
30:49 gland two of them on both sides your
30:51 temple just inside your skull you need
30:54 to have exposure to the Sun what is the
30:56 Sun doing the Sun is a gigantic verb
30:59 machine it is shaking the ether all
31:03 winds from its surface to us doesn't
31:07 matter where the Sun is that's what it's
31:08 doing it shakes it and it shakes ether
31:12 through our skull and then brezin AIT's
31:15 off of the configuration of cells inside
31:19 the pituitary gland which then
31:21 manufacturers a chemical we know as
31:23 vitamin D that chemical is vital for the
31:27 entire body to remain healthy it cannot
31:30 be taken in a pill form and have any
31:33 effect on your body you must get a
31:35 little bit of Sun
31:36 or some other light that stimulates your
31:38 head exactly to the frequency that the
31:40 Sun does and then you'll be healthy in a
31:45 way the Sun is helping you eat ether but
31:50 it's not considered a food supply when
31:53 we talk about the five food groups right
31:55 the five food groups that were developed
31:57 at least in the United States of America
31:59 and I don't know exactly when I would
32:00 soon was probably in the 40s it was to
32:03 make sure that as we grow things in this
32:06 country you know we harvest livestock
32:10 for meats we have our vegetables we have
32:13 our fruits all these things they wanted
32:16 us to consume because they were selling
32:19 it they were making it and selling it
32:21 and it was a basis of an ecosystem
32:23 remember the Catholic Church wants you
32:25 to eat fish on Friday because the
32:27 Catholic Roman Church had cornered the
32:29 entire fish market and so they lied to
32:32 the people that this is some God you
32:36 know ordained thing that to be in God's
32:38 good light you had to eat fish right you
32:41 know the level of which that church lied
32:43 about everything is just incalculable
32:46 right but that's why they did it but why
32:51 is it that one country can nearly
32:54 sustain itself entirely on fish and one
32:58 country can sustain itself on meat and a
33:02 small part of some countries can live
33:04 off of vegetarianism or veganism up to a
33:08 point right they're very docile human
33:09 beings once they get to that level but
33:13 how is this and then we know that in
33:15 America and I can tell you from when I
33:16 was a kid you know my dad was pretty
33:19 good about you know making sure I ate
33:22 the five food groups like he would say
33:24 you have to pick a vegetable you have to
33:26 pick a meat you know we have to eat
33:28 these basic things so he was pretty good
33:29 with that but by the time I hit probably
33:32 13 14 years old even though we still
33:35 lived together and we would still have
33:37 these types of meals she'd you know I
33:42 eat crap constantly and I processed
33:46 cereals super sugary cereals I drank
33:48 jolt
33:49 oh love you if you remember that as the
33:51 it's the og energy drink of the world it
33:54 tasted awful it was like pure caffeine
33:57 but now look at people to get addicted
33:59 to things like methamphetamines they
34:03 start to lose all of their body's
34:06 composure they get horrible skin their
34:09 teeth crunch away and fall out of their
34:11 heads I mean they look absolutely awful
34:13 they get all serrated all over their
34:16 body and of course if they inject
34:17 themselves with it then they got all the
34:19 holes from needles and that kind of
34:21 stuff so we've seen these extreme cases
34:23 all of you have probably seen the the
34:25 picture compilations of someone who was
34:27 beautiful especially these women men you
34:32 know I can't speak for the dude so the
34:33 dudes have the same thing they're
34:34 handsome and they turn a deist like like
34:37 zombie versions of themselves right
34:39 it'll be like their arrest records at
34:41 the police station you know some of
34:43 these there's a notorious one where this
34:44 woman I think was arrested like I don't
34:46 know 15 times or something so they have
34:49 15 photographs of this woman going down
34:51 the tubes and the very first time you
34:53 saw her and there's dozens of these
34:55 people they're beautiful I mean they're
34:58 just like you'd be proud to have that
35:01 face by the time it's over they'll never
35:05 have that face again and it's sad how
35:10 interesting would it be if there was a
35:13 health regimen invented in this world by
35:15 which we could somehow major the
35:16 vibration of food that was good for us
35:18 and they measure the vibration of food
35:22 that is notoriously bad for us you know
35:24 why is it that pure sugar causes
35:26 inflammation all over the body if it
35:29 could figure these things out because we
35:31 endorse the science by which we are
35:32 constructed of and reintroduce this
35:36 beautiful theory that explains gravity
35:39 explains explains electricity and
35:42 explains all of the mass and energy in
35:44 the universe - the intangible you know
35:48 god particle which I would call love
35:50 right
35:51 not the Higgs boson
35:53 fictional thing they've invented and
35:55 then fictionally found what a joke that
35:57 thing is so you know what I want this
36:02 episode to sort of feel like and this
36:04 might be a little ludicrous for some of
36:06 you to consider but think about any of
36:09 you that are familiar with the science
36:10 fiction writer philip k dick now there's
36:15 a bunch of people like this but Phil
36:17 Oakey dick took it to a level that was
36:18 unprecedented he was able to look into
36:21 the future and sort of see these
36:23 dystopian bizarre ass worlds these 1984
36:27 worlds while science fiction was
36:29 actually a part of that universe so the
36:31 Blade Runner movie is you know his
36:34 vision and again when Ridley Scott
36:36 showed him the 20-minute reel that he
36:39 had cut together to win over philip k
36:42 dick he was running around saying don't
36:43 see this movie they stole my book and
36:45 dah dah dah which wasn't true he turned
36:49 to Ridley Scott and he said how did you
36:50 do that and Ridley goes what do you mean
36:53 he goes how did you well first thing he
36:56 said is can I see it again and he
36:57 watched it all over again but after it
36:58 was over 40 minutes later 45 minutes
37:00 later he turned to me goes well how did
37:02 you do that he was what do you mean he
37:03 said that's exactly the way I saw in my
37:06 brain while I was writing it and you
37:08 nailed it
37:08 I think that's profound I think that's
37:11 amazing
37:12 that's wonderful but don't think about
37:16 what I'm talking about here you know
37:18 that what I'm talking about if I'm
37:20 correct ok and again I trust Tesla a
37:23 thousand percent most of you do then I'm
37:27 talking about something that may not
37:28 occur unless we can take this planet
37:30 over and get these bankers out of here
37:32 these corrupt politicians these corrupt
37:33 journalists these crap corporate
37:35 corporations you know potentially people
37:38 that are naive but participate in our
37:43 law enforcement or what-have-you
37:45 if we can't get them to step aside and
37:47 at least endorse the movement and go oh
37:49 my god I was just upside down my whole
37:51 life I'm sorry we're gonna move forward
37:53 here we're gonna greenlight zero-point
37:54 energy systems and all this other stuff
37:56 this subject is potentially what 50 100
38:01 200 years away for being the way that
38:04 society can operate on a health
38:07 the I mentioned this this grounding
38:15 thing in a previous episode but I'm
38:16 gonna repeat it here just in case
38:19 because you know potentially drawing in
38:21 the proper cloud crowd to do this
38:23 the gentleman who really did a bunch of
38:26 research in this has a story and I have
38:29 a I don't quite have the same history
38:33 whatsoever but I can believe his story
38:35 because I came from Kansas where you
38:37 still had completely 100% Native
38:40 American families now he would he's
38:43 probably 20 years older than I am at
38:46 least so you go back into probably I
38:48 guess the 50s maybe even the 40s and his
38:52 claim is that he had a best friend that
38:54 was Native American and they still had
38:56 teepees I don't know if they had houses
38:58 as well but he still had a tepee and he
39:00 goes I would go into the TV with my
39:02 friend and his mother said take your
39:05 shoes off those will make you sick and
39:08 how phenomenal is that because she
39:10 understood grounding she may not have
39:12 understood the ether model of grounding
39:14 and the electricity of grounding but she
39:15 just knew your feet must touch the soil
39:18 of this planet for you to remain healthy
39:22 and his research because the way he
39:27 tells the story cuz he invented this
39:29 this blanket you can sleep on where you
39:30 run a cable out your bedroom window you
39:33 stick anything around and then the sheet
39:35 is made of like silver particles and a
39:37 bunch of other things that are
39:38 conductive and so it takes your your
39:41 body conductivity out to the ground
39:43 right but he said that he takes you
39:48 through all the research that he did and
39:50 how he asked a bunch of doctors and
39:51 scientists about the body grounding
39:53 issue and they said well you know we've
39:54 never heard of this so it's probably a
39:56 bunch of crap and you know he explained
39:58 what he had heard when he was a kid and
40:00 they laughed at him and saying as well
40:02 do you mind helping me prove that this
40:04 is crazy and what they found out was
40:07 that the the overall meridians of the
40:11 body balanced out beautifully within
40:14 just 15 20 minutes of putting your feet
40:16 on the ground
40:17 and that that state of being was
40:20 extremely healthy for the human body and
40:23 the number one side effect of doing this
40:25 regimen it was that inflammation went
40:27 down it D ionizes your body takes it
40:31 takes the overwhelming negative electron
40:34 charge of your body and it makes it more
40:37 you could say alkaline you have as many
40:40 positives as you have negatives so
40:42 you're in a nice beautiful flow your
40:45 entire nervous system behaves better but
40:49 now think about what he's saying and
40:50 what I said at the beginning of the
40:51 episode we didn't have shoes back in the
40:55 day like we do now we didn't have paved
40:58 roads everywhere we go we didn't live
41:01 inside houses that had floors and so we
41:06 pity all these places around the world
41:08 when we look back in archaeological digs
41:10 where they had to live in mud huts and
41:13 mud mud ground and all that stuff but
41:16 it's really funny that when you when you
41:18 were a kid seriously if you were 8 years
41:21 old to 12 years old especially before
41:23 the internet and TV and social media
41:26 gets a hold of you if you could if your
41:28 parents would let you build a mud hut
41:29 the backyard but the full roof and
41:31 everything didn't collapse on top of you
41:33 you would do in a heartbeat and you'd
41:35 love it that's why we had treehouses
41:37 right on little domains we could pretend
41:40 we had a fort and and we could pretend
41:43 that you built them out of your your
41:45 cushions in your house and you pretended
41:47 it's your own little world right I mean
41:49 how I can still remember the euphoria I
41:51 used to feel when I was a kid I dated a
41:54 girl about five years ago had a nine
41:55 year old and we put the chairs together
41:58 and build a fort out of every pillow in
42:02 the whole place every cushion and we
42:04 would watch TV through a hole that we
42:07 built in the Ford it was awesome and you
42:09 could totally relive those moments in a
42:10 couple seconds right but the whole thing
42:13 was this ancient pass was more holistic
42:16 to the earth itself because we never
42:18 lost contact with the earth and now what
42:21 do we wear we wear rubber soles rubber
42:24 soles are obviously insulators against
42:26 any sort of electrical transfer up to a
42:28 point
42:28 right
42:29 you sort of built these habitats that
42:32 are you know insulators or Faraday cages
42:35 from the beauty of the earth itself how
42:39 many times have you gone into this rut
42:43 in your life you're eating a lot of fast
42:44 food even if you buy stuff and bring it
42:47 home it's you know it's okay it's good
42:49 you get full you go back to your your
42:51 grind and all that stuff but then you go
42:53 over to a friend's house and they are a
42:55 chef of some sort and they cut together
42:59 just a bunch of vegetables and just a
43:03 little bit of dressing on it not too
43:05 much nothing's over cooks nothing slushy
43:08 or mushy and you just ingest this
43:10 beautiful nature and you just feel
43:14 amazing you feel amazing while you're
43:15 eating in it smells good tastes good the
43:18 variety of taste out of vegetables is
43:20 phenomenal and then you go back to your
43:24 fast food I'm super guilty of this I
43:27 just this happened to me this year a
43:29 friend of mine brought over a salad and
43:31 it was amazing and I was sitting there
43:34 going geez this probably took her 15
43:38 minutes to make for everybody in the
43:40 room and I'm I'm disappointed in myself
43:44 when it comes to that kind of regimen I
43:46 need to put more effort into it and so
43:50 even though I tell you that meat is
43:51 important on this show
43:52 I believe that your vegetables are
43:55 extremely important especially your
43:57 cruciferous vegetables right there's
44:00 nothing better than a Sookie 12 to 16
44:05 ounce glass of pureed gmo-free carrot
44:10 juice it is like sex man it is heaven to
44:15 drink this stuff and to think that it
44:18 tastes that good and it's that good for
44:24 you it's tremendous and I forgot to give
44:26 you a guy's a caution that's gonna be a
44:27 little off topic and a little graphic
44:29 but it's something that I need to tell
44:31 you guys if you do get addicted to
44:33 carrot juice and you get your fully
44:35 healthy or you're fighting cancer or
44:37 something like that one of the things
44:39 that happens when you eat a lot of
44:41 carrot juice
44:42 other than you
44:42 skintone can get to an orange I don't
44:45 know how much you have to drink to get
44:46 that Steve Jobs thing to happen to you
44:49 but your stool will definitely get a
44:51 little weird
44:51 it's the only thing I can tell you is
44:56 clay that's what I can tell you and it's
44:59 not like anything you've ever passed
45:00 before so if you do ingest a tremendous
45:02 amount of it you can expect your stool
45:04 to be a little more effort let's just
45:09 put that way on all levels okay so fair
45:12 warning has now been distributed but
45:15 ever since this whole thing has been
45:17 reintroduced to me this either thing
45:19 through Eric Dollard god bless that man
45:22 who essentially dug up all the old texts
45:25 all the old books and reread them to us
45:27 and then he compared it to modern-day
45:29 science and he said look how much we've
45:31 been duped I can't stop thinking about
45:34 ether all the time and it I have to say
45:37 you know I repeat and repeat and repeat
45:41 on this show that when you think the
45:42 truth and you start digesting concepts
45:46 of truth you have this amazing beautiful
45:49 wind of God I mean it's I can only
45:52 describe it as the Christians describe
45:54 the holy spirit going through your body
45:55 I am reinterpreting my entire reality as
46:00 ether particles except that now but
46:06 they're doing this show and having
46:07 tremendous lectures over and over and
46:09 over again
46:09 I mean tremendously long lectures right
46:13 where I do distinguish the soul from the
46:17 body that's a big thing I do envision a
46:21 life force that's separate from the
46:24 ether but the other thing that I
46:26 recognize is that to the degree my body
46:29 is healthy with its ether all patterns
46:33 in place with it being fully functional
46:36 the way that it was intended as it was
46:37 designed every organ in my body okay I
46:40 see the spirit of this universe going
46:45 through me much more efficiently I think
46:48 my creativity is boosted I think my
46:50 happiness is boosted my my whole EQ or
46:54 II I number right
46:56 emotional intelligence is growing and
47:00 growing and growing every day and it's
47:01 higher than it's ever been in my opinion
47:04 and I have that episode that's coming
47:06 here which will be out before this one
47:07 comes out but if you think about
47:10 self-awareness self-management
47:14 motivational control your empathy
47:19 towards other people it's all in there
47:23 and I fear that through either
47:29 serendipity which means by pure accident
47:33 the individuals that want to be
47:35 completely in control and make sure that
47:38 we don't have control know this and thus
47:41 feed us crap you know I love this
47:45 statement that I've heard a lot lately
47:47 which is that we could fix this entire
47:49 planet in a matter of months if we just
47:52 had these evil people removed from power
47:59 but they don't have anymore say I just
48:04 marathon the twilight zone again the
48:08 other not thought the whole thing but I
48:09 marathon probably about 12 to 15
48:12 episodes recently and there was this
48:14 episode and I forget its name but it's
48:16 all about a guy that has owned this
48:20 companies families on this company for a
48:21 long time and he is now getting into
48:23 electronics I mean man this was a
48:25 prophecy if there ever was one and he
48:29 talked about the idea that well the
48:32 whole thing starts off where he's buying
48:34 these new machines these new computers
48:36 to replace people in the factory now the
48:41 funny thing was is that it was you know
48:43 that the studios were not able to have
48:46 special effects do all the things that
48:48 he was saying so they were basically
48:50 putting like a computer in a room and
48:51 saying that it was taking care of
48:52 manufacturing but you never saw a
48:54 robotic arm do anything it's a little of
48:56 a suspension disbelief in there but this
48:58 guy was complete he was the descendant
49:00 of his father his grandfather who had
49:03 the company he was talking to an old man
49:04 that was hired probably by his father
49:06 and he kissed kept getting rid of
49:08 employees and he was so
49:10 kept talking about this is progress this
49:12 is progress and if you're not for
49:13 progress then you're stupid and you
49:15 deserve to be you know knocked out but
49:17 meanwhile he's removing the humanity
49:20 from the product and the old man's
49:24 looking at him and he's just getting
49:26 more and more pissed off at this guy and
49:28 so eventually the guy he says you know
49:31 this machine this last machine I've
49:32 installed is the last machine then we're
49:34 gonna buy and it's the one that replaces
49:36 you because I'm gonna give you a giant
49:38 severance package and a great you know
49:42 retirement package so you'll be just
49:43 fine
49:44 and a guy smacks him across the face and
49:48 he says you keep your money and he says
49:50 what you don't understand is you're
49:52 removing what man needs which is a good
49:55 hard day's work which is what our
49:56 president now keeps talking about you
49:58 got to go back to some trade skills
49:59 there they're the most fun in the whole
50:01 world whether you're programming a
50:02 website or building a car or doing
50:05 landscaping or painting the side of a
50:07 house or doing whatever the hell you do
50:08 you clean a house and it's fantastic
50:10 right you feel good you did something at
50:12 the end of the day as long as you can
50:13 get a living wage which is something we
50:15 need to work on we'll be alright and so
50:20 the guy ends up the old man who dislikes
50:23 this guy ends up drinking in the bar
50:25 across the street and the way they in
50:29 the episode is that eventually this this
50:32 jerk-off who was firing everybody and
50:35 replacing everybody with machines
50:37 wanders across the street and he's
50:39 totally diss shoveled you can see hasn't
50:40 shaved in a couple days it's kind of
50:42 like me right now and he's his suits all
50:44 undone and he comes in there and he's
50:46 just a broken man and he sits at the end
50:48 of the bar and of course he looks over
50:50 at the old man he's like mmm looks like
50:53 somebody else got replaced right and the
50:56 guy would always spin his watch on the
50:59 fob that was his his character to remove
51:03 and so he comes across the bar and he's
51:06 you know it over to the bar and he says
51:07 you know what happened to me man you
51:08 wouldn't believe it you wouldn't believe
51:10 what happened to me he goes the Board of
51:12 Directors voted and they they replaced
51:14 me they replaced me with something you
51:16 know the electronic thing and he's
51:18 finally he sees what the old man was
51:21 saying with all he had one of his
51:22 employees get real disgruntled and break
51:24 one of the computers and and of course
51:26 he got his in the end he that his he was
51:29 Faust you know he signed the deal with
51:31 the devil and got his own and when they
51:34 go back over to his office the funny
51:36 thing was is that the office had Robbie
51:38 the robot in there they had dug that up
51:40 and he was spending the FOB you know
51:42 it's really funny so you know the
51:46 subject is something I think that will
51:49 grow over time if we can get good
51:53 science rediscovered I would be
51:59 interested in any of you because I know
52:01 all of you are busy and I haven't really
52:03 had a listener approached me with
52:06 anything related to ether and say man me
52:09 too and and I'm researching this that
52:12 any other thing and of all the listeners
52:13 no one's ever come to me with that sort
52:15 of opinion about things so I sort of
52:20 feel very isolated in this particular
52:22 regiment but you know I can't stop my
52:27 brain I'm gonna continue thinking about
52:28 everything until I can come up with some
52:30 better epiphanies I did just watch a
52:33 documentary really short one today on
52:36 the youtubes
52:37 at my lounge where they were talking
52:40 about how they are well it was the
52:43 entire evolution of aviation as it
52:46 related to the actual compensation for
52:51 vibrational winds that go over wings
52:53 because they had built planes with a
52:56 particular level of sturdiness and as
52:58 they kept flying them faster and faster
53:00 there was a point where planes were
53:02 shattering because the wings would start
53:05 vibrating so intensely and once it
53:07 started going the faster that you win it
53:09 would just explode and they showed some
53:11 videos of this stuff was pretty powerful
53:14 but I think about that for the human
53:16 body you know drinking things that are
53:19 really agitated you know the and I you
53:24 know there's the thing I told you about
53:26 and it's always been a mystery to me
53:27 it's been a really weird thing that I
53:30 was over at this woman's house and she
53:33 was 60 years old she had grown up in
53:34 sort of the upper
53:35 upper-class or at least medium upper
53:37 class world so old money lots of it she
53:42 married into a family that was you know
53:44 they got matched mate
53:45 to another guy and her family was weird
53:49 you know
53:49 her family was actually one of these
53:51 nudist families really strange she was
53:54 the woman that said she thought her
53:56 father's testicles were beautiful I was
53:58 like holy hell I hope that's an artistic
54:02 statement but a matter place for lunch
54:05 she's feeding me for lunch and she
54:07 basically fed me like it was ricotta
54:10 cheese and tomatoes and that was the
54:12 whole thing and I'm sitting look at this
54:14 lady like I'm gonna be hungry after I
54:17 get done eating all this just so you
54:19 know but anyway she served me room
54:21 temperature water and I said don't and
54:26 you know I you know was okay I didn't I
54:30 didn't say anything but she mentioned
54:32 about this whole thing about not
54:33 drinking cold water and this woman had
54:36 never consumed a soda in her entire life
54:40 which I thought was pretty wild right
54:42 but what was interesting it was a
54:45 glimpse into the regiments of families
54:48 like this that had this sort of coveted
54:51 knowledge that's very simple
54:53 it was a less-is-more formula and so I
54:57 thought why would that be you know so I
55:00 plucked it up several times online you
55:02 know what's the deal with drinking cold
55:04 water and it has to do with shocking the
55:08 organs in the body and when you think
55:11 about the whole idea of eating ether you
55:12 have movement in all particles and if
55:16 you were to drink cold substances which
55:18 were addicted to at least in the United
55:20 States of America you you have a
55:24 contrary contradictory movement of the
55:28 particles that you're ingesting versus
55:29 the ninety eight point eight temperature
55:31 that's inside your body and so my other
55:36 question that immediately pops up is the
55:39 opposite polarity do these people drink
55:41 hot coffee wouldn't that be just the
55:44 same because if the body is ninety eight
55:46 point eight and you know boy you know
55:49 really hot
55:49 of a faucet in your house usually ranges
55:52 from about a hundred and ten degrees to
55:53 about 115 maybe 120 tops if you really
55:56 want to get first degree burns and so I
56:00 don't know what coffee is I don't know
56:03 how hot that stuff is but man I've had
56:05 some hot ass coffee in my lifetime but
56:08 what do we do we're cold in the
56:10 wintertime and so we consume a warm
56:12 substance or we we consume an alcohol
56:14 because it sort of numbs our body to
56:17 it's it's temperature
56:19 I got heavily into watching people
56:23 consume hot peppers until I got some of
56:27 my own and you know it's a it's a rush
56:30 man you eat a hot pepper
56:31 I think the hottest thing I ever really
56:34 got to the point I could eat without
56:35 dying was a habanero I could just put it
56:38 in my mouth and chew it up and it's hot
56:40 and you have a little bit of a rush I've
56:43 got a I've got a nuclear candy bar in my
56:47 refrigerator that I did one every once
56:49 in a while which is full of Trinidad
56:51 scorpion and calori California or
56:54 Carolina Reaper in it it's just
56:57 delicious chocolate I mean it's like
56:58 this dark chocolate it's amazing but man
57:00 you can only ingest like a tiny bit of
57:03 this stuff unless you're a pepper head
57:07 but spices have been known to shake
57:10 apart other bacteria in your body so
57:13 it's sort of an antibiotic so hot
57:15 peppers were a medicine back in the day
57:18 when you before we had other methods of
57:20 doing it we have foods like honey honey
57:25 is the the most natural anti or
57:29 antibiotic that the world creates you
57:32 can take it with you on a trip to you
57:35 know out in the woods when you're
57:36 camping and that kind of stuff just make
57:38 sure you have it you can apply it to
57:39 your food and make it taste better but
57:42 if someone's crawling through some
57:43 stream and cuts their leg instead of
57:45 getting gangrene you just pack it full
57:49 of honey and they showed this in the
57:52 movie Gladiator
57:53 when Russell Crowe's character had a
57:56 gash in his arm I think in this African
57:58 guy who was chewing up this compound of
58:00 root and a bunch of other stuff and he
58:02 that in the and the wound and he sealed
58:04 it up and it just prevents anything from
58:08 growing in that in that area of the body
58:10 the Babylonians used it the Egyptians
58:13 used it I mean it's as old as the
58:15 history books man so the thing is this
58:18 you all know this from other doctrines
58:21 that you adopt in your life when it's
58:24 from nature it's good for you when it's
58:27 synthesized and processed it's bad for
58:29 you if it's really really old it's bad
58:32 for you when it's really fresh it's good
58:34 for you right anyway it's starting to
58:37 spring clear I need to get out of here
58:39 hope you hope you feel me if you have
58:43 another deep thoughts radio.com please
58:44 go all the links are there audio video
58:46 lock facebook GUP twitter patreon paypal
58:50 take care of yourself in someone else
