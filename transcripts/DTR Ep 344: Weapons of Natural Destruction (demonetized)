00:00 [Music]
00:34 good evening ladies and gentlemen and
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts on this
00:40 very very cold evening and if you want
00:42 to know how much I love you let's take a
00:44 look at this forty degrees it's 40
00:51 degrees out here eight more and I'm
00:54 going to turn into a popsicle so today
00:56 we're gonna talk about something I'm
00:57 gonna call weapons of natural
00:59 destruction our W in DS and what are we
01:06 gonna define those as well I think that
01:11 there's sufficient evidence to question
01:14 whether or not weapons are being used to
01:17 create natural disasters and I think
01:19 that we obviously don't want this to be
01:23 the case because we have to live in this
01:24 world too and anyone that would use such
01:27 a weapon on us are people that will
01:29 never tell the truth and they have some
01:32 other whacked-out agenda that they think
01:34 needs to occur or they just like
01:35 watching people suffer as well they get
01:39 their calculations wrong from time to
01:40 time and they're historically known for
01:44 making gigantic mistakes if you study
01:48 trench warfare from World War one it is
01:53 probably one of the most brutal ways to
01:55 fight war ever conceived the credit is
01:59 always given to the Germans that way if
02:02 it's horrible you can blame the Germans
02:05 I'm sure it's occurred in other parts of
02:08 history but the idea was that you want
02:14 to create they wanted to create such a
02:16 formidable difficult way to take land
02:20 away from them that they dug these giant
02:24 trenches you've seen them in movies it's
02:25 all over the TV series carniv√†le and the
02:29 soldiers
02:31 sit down inside there I would imagine
02:33 they're about ten feet deep maybe twelve
02:36 but you need to be able to climb out of
02:37 them so they all have these wooden
02:39 ladders they also need to prop
02:41 themselves up so they can shoot
02:42 artillery and throw grenades and use
02:44 machine guns and all kinds of crazy
02:46 lethal
02:47 [ __ ] including chemical weapons which
02:49 were used in World War one and then of
02:52 course the Allies learned how to do it
02:53 and it is some of the most brutal forms
02:59 of war that has ever been invented right
03:01 because it created amazing shell shock
03:05 you have people sitting in cold damp
03:08 trenches for months and then years and
03:12 it's like you don't you're your past
03:15 reality is like blown out of your brain
03:17 because you have you know one artillery
03:20 shell after another dead bodies and all
03:22 kinds of horrible stuff and why am i
03:25 painting this picture because somewhere
03:31 higher up than these poor soldiers stuck
03:34 in this ridiculous banker war financed
03:36 from both ends you have well outside of
03:42 the bankers who we all know how they
03:44 work you have generally some pretty
03:48 normal people being the officers and
03:51 generals like you know there are all
03:52 officers but presidential figures and
03:56 politicians that are green letting these
03:58 wars and they know at least after the
04:05 first and - Intel reports come back how
04:07 utterly horrible the conditions are and
04:09 yet they continue the war they continue
04:13 this it's so important thing you know
04:16 what were one a world war two involved
04:21 taking land from people that the land
04:25 didn't belong to you know taking you
04:27 sorry taking land away from people it
04:29 belong to and giving it to yourself
04:31 right and you know obviously the Germans
04:35 are a huge part of that problem but they
04:38 easily convinced other allies in the
04:40 area to do the same game so this notion
04:43 that we don't have the fabric in
04:46 humanity to create weapons of natural
04:52 destruction considering we have weapons
04:55 of mass destruction it's something you
04:58 have to knock out of your head
04:59 so if anyone's just like oh this is
05:02 ridiculous this can't happen it's like
05:05 yes it can and it has happened in
05:09 different forms not of natural
05:10 destruction necessarily because what is
05:13 um what is the big liability problem
05:17 with war I should say where's one of the
05:20 biggest problems of war and it's the
05:21 liability of how you fight your war we
05:24 have all these rules now in certain
05:26 countries went back into corners will
05:29 throw the rules away because well their
05:30 [ __ ] choice do they have
05:31 either gonna lose or they're gonna roll
05:34 out some some chemical weapons or
05:37 something else right if they had
05:38 something else which is why diplomacy is
05:41 usually always a good idea and sanctions
05:44 are not such a bad idea because you then
05:47 just corner someone financially but
05:51 sanctions can also feel just like
05:54 military cornering where literally
05:57 there's tanks rolling in on your country
05:59 and you're stuck in your in your kitchen
06:01 cupboard going oh my god what am I gonna
06:03 do so sometimes you know economic
06:06 sanctions could be that bad as well we
06:09 need to keep that in mind so what do I
06:11 mean exactly weapons of natural
06:14 destruction well I'm gonna tell you I am
06:19 49 years old I lived in Tornado Alley
06:24 Kansas now technically speaking not to
06:28 over dramatize the situation my town for
06:31 whatever reason has had a couple
06:32 tornadoes go through but nothing like
06:34 Joplin Missouri or down there by just
06:38 south of Oklahoma City where they always
06:39 get the cat fives it's an interesting
06:42 thing that almost as we upgrade
06:46 toothpaste and products in this world
06:49 iPhones and whatever computers all of
06:53 these storms that we have now are
06:55 upgrading as well and I think that that
06:59 is something doesn't make any sense now
07:03 for those of you are all global warming
07:05 climate change [ __ ] it seems kind of
07:09 that's real
07:12 global warming would stop all this from
07:14 happening global warming would cease the
07:18 cold front meeting the warm front
07:21 so tornadoes and hurricanes immediately
07:23 cease to exist or if they occur there's
07:26 just gonna be a little spout and no
07:27 one's gonna videotape it and no one's
07:29 gonna lose a home over it but we also
07:32 have earthquakes that happened in the
07:35 ocean now they cause tsunamis now it's
07:41 not like tsunamis just invented
07:43 themselves but there's a reason why in
07:45 2014 and in 2011 the citizens even the
07:51 old ones that are 80 years old are
07:53 looking at the coast and they're like oh
07:56 well the water just left must be a
07:58 tsunami we've got to be a little bit
08:00 careful but what's not gonna happen is
08:03 280,000 people die on I don't know how
08:06 many coastlines are a dozen coastlines
08:09 back in 2004 was a Christmas Day or
08:12 Christmas Eve or whatever was probably
08:15 the most relaxed and happy I've ever
08:16 seen Bill Clinton and George Herbert
08:18 Walker Bush was on their mutual tour
08:21 after the 2004 suit or earthquake
08:26 tsunami that killed 280,000 people I
08:29 mean just think about that that is so
08:32 massive it's ridiculous but I've never
08:35 seen two guys laughs and chumming up
08:37 more than when they were running around
08:39 trying to raise awareness and raise
08:41 money into foundations they're gonna
08:44 somehow solve the problem right then we
08:47 have Fukushima March 11th 28th 2011 so
08:53 you get two big Elevens in their
08:55 coincidence
08:57 my experience with Fukushima was
09:00 actually pretty interesting because just
09:01 like most of that I just watched it on
09:02 TV and then you know was utterly
09:05 horrified that you had these
09:08 60-foot waves coming in that turned into
09:10 30-foot waves way inland these horrible
09:14 rolling waves of death you know with
09:18 just burning houses on top and you know
09:21 it was just horrific right
09:23 don't forget the 1989 earthquake as well
09:26 in San Francisco which was three and a
09:27 half miles off the coast of Santa Cruz
09:29 which then racked both Santa Cruz and
09:33 everything in between I was down here in
09:36 Los Angeles at the time but there was
09:38 something very interesting about
09:39 Fukushima I have a very liberal friend
09:45 of mine who's very brilliant very
09:48 wealthy because he invented something it
09:51 has still sewing to this day and he's up
09:57 in the Bay Area
09:58 he lives near Berkeley or at least did
10:00 I'm not sure where he is today but I was
10:04 in direct communication with him about a
10:06 lot of things at the time because we
10:08 both were you know comparing our
10:11 conspiracy books at the time and he
10:13 contacted me and said this is not what
10:16 you think it is and I said okay keep
10:19 going he said well the professors at
10:21 Berkeley that he hangs out with and
10:24 chums with had figured out that the and
10:27 this is just me passing it on to you
10:29 that the World Bank had asked Japan to
10:32 deposit something in the neighborhood of
10:33 a hundred and fifty billion dollars into
10:36 their bank to help essentially pay the
10:39 bill for what was going totally [ __ ]
10:41 south in the EU Japan declined to move
10:44 assets into their bank you know spec
10:47 basically asking them to open the
10:48 biggest checking account on planet earth
10:50 right but they declined meanwhile you
10:54 have a bunch of German engineers
10:55 crawling all over the reactors
10:58 especially reactor four as I heard it
11:00 described by one of these exact
11:03 scientists who were at the site for
11:06 months and months up to the earthquake
11:08 in March he had stated publicly that
11:12 there were no rods at all inside the
11:15 reactor for that I'll been taken out and
11:18 stored because it was under maintenance
11:19 at the same time it's under maintenance
11:20 an Israeli company as I heard it
11:22 described by my friend who is very
11:26 liberal so he's very pro everything
11:29 right again I don't know how he sits
11:32 with any of the modern day left
11:34 progressive stuff so cut him out of all
11:36 that junk
11:37 but he said that the second the
11:42 earthquake occurred Japan deposited most
11:47 of the money that they wanted
11:49 transferred into that bank account at
11:51 the World Bank if any of you can verify
11:54 those deposits and that transaction
11:57 please comment in the section if you are
11:59 simply audio and you know the truth you
12:01 know do whatever you can do Facebook
12:06 whatever there isn't but an Israeli
12:09 company a security company installed
12:11 cameras supposedly in all the reactors
12:13 and the cameras were the size of sort of
12:15 like small Samsonite suitcases and these
12:18 engineers who are very familiar with
12:20 nuclear power plants and security
12:22 systems that go in them we're looking
12:26 around going why are these cameras so
12:29 gigantic I mean I know we have radiation
12:31 issues but we're not shooting [ __ ]
12:33 Kodak film in them right now some of
12:35 this might be true and some of this
12:37 might be false but we have to look
12:39 around at what we saw I have probably
12:42 viewed without exaggeration a good I
12:46 would say conservatively 10 hours worth
12:49 of the Fukushima tsunami footage it's
12:54 all over the internet and a bunch of new
12:56 clips of release that I had never seen
12:58 before and so you know I brushed up on
13:01 this but you have an earthquake that
13:03 it's about 9.1 you hear it you hear it
13:07 vary depending on what footage you're
13:10 watching they only had it at like an 8
13:11 point something at first and then it was
13:13 a nine point two at one point and then
13:15 I've heard it's 9.0 so somewhere around
13:17 nine point one 9.0 big right you have to
13:21 always remember for those of you don't
13:22 sit in earthquake land a nine is twice
13:24 an eighth and age is twice a seven etc
13:27 etc but you have all these you know
13:30 massive tsunami waves coming in to
13:32 Japan's coastline the video tapes of the
13:38 earthquake are very real you know people
13:40 videotaped their living rooms and
13:44 businesses and this earthquake went on
13:47 for a really really long time
13:50 so it was a massive thing that occurred
13:52 now what is the official story let's get
13:54 that out of the way real quick they say
13:57 two tectonic plates are doing
13:58 essentially a little subduction dance in
14:01 the middle of the ocean and one gets
14:03 underneath the other one and a ton of
14:04 pressure builds up and then eventually
14:06 going it slips past and that creates a
14:10 gigantic log myth logarithmic wave that
14:13 rolls into land and starts shaking the
14:15 hell out of everything but the
14:18 interesting thing about this earthquake
14:19 is that very few buildings fell down as
14:23 a result of fukushima's earthquake yet
14:26 everyone felt it but as the wave started
14:29 coming in you started to see a little
14:31 logic problem at least I think there's a
14:34 logic problem now Japan is a very old
14:37 country they have structures that are
14:41 very old on their land and the fact they
14:45 donate some structures every once in a
14:47 while and they don't really have a place
14:48 for it over there they'll donate a
14:49 pagoda there's a very famous one in Los
14:52 Angeles supposed to be hundreds of years
14:55 old that was like 450 years old outside
15:00 this sushi restaurant which has now been
15:02 changed to something else
15:04 just really sad but as soon as this wave
15:07 starts rolling in of course the locals
15:09 are looking at it and they're thinking
15:11 okay we do need to get up on high ground
15:12 but it's you know how bad could it be
15:14 right and then once this thing started
15:17 cresting you know 20-foot walls like it
15:21 was nothing buildings that had just
15:24 survived in 9.1 earthquake now again it
15:28 diminishes as it comes into land so you
15:31 know there's going to be this circular
15:33 diagram of destruction but just to give
15:37 you an example when the six where I was
15:40 at 6.9 I think was generally the
15:45 consensus of the 89 earthquake in San
15:47 Francisco off the coast of Santa Barbara
15:49 when it or saying I'm sorry Santa Cruz
15:51 let's not get that wrong as soon as it
15:53 hit the city of San Francisco's about a
15:55 5.8 the problem with the San Francisco
15:59 area is that the earthquakes go up and
16:01 down and so it slaps
16:03 the buildings and that is the most
16:04 destructive wave configuration for any
16:07 type of living area in Los Angeles it
16:11 goes sideways left and right so we don't
16:13 have the massive destruction that occurs
16:17 by that means right but as soon as a
16:20 brisk amount of water hits some of these
16:22 buildings they just floated away
16:24 they stayed intact in large part so the
16:27 four corners stayed together the roof
16:29 stayed on top of these buildings just
16:30 floated away and that tells you
16:32 something those buildings are so ancient
16:34 that they're not bolted to a foundation
16:37 they are simply using gravity as a way
16:39 to stay on their foundation okay so now
16:43 if you were to shake that building with
16:47 any level of 6.0 or higher which
16:50 definitely would have been the case
16:51 because Japan is not a gigantic country
16:53 and the the ports that you look at that
16:57 are right off the coast had this
16:59 happened those buildings would have
17:01 shaken to the ground would have shaken
17:02 off their foundations it happens in
17:04 California all the time I rented a house
17:06 in the Bay Area for geez
17:09 two years at least two years that was
17:14 shaken off its foundation it had crack
17:16 all the way down the center of the house
17:17 and the cheap-ass dude it owned the
17:19 place took the insurance money instead
17:20 of getting the house fixed could use the
17:23 fireplace because it was split down the
17:24 middle but when they looked at the
17:26 footage and you've all seen the footage
17:28 of the reactor for exploding these
17:32 German physicists were like no wait a
17:33 minute
17:34 what's going to blow up in there there's
17:36 nothing in there that can explode we've
17:37 removed the rods and a rumor started
17:40 that they actually put the rods on top
17:42 of the roof which is the biggest
17:44 laughable joke on planet earth you
17:45 cannot do that they would simply
17:47 vaporize by themselves right these
17:51 things are extremely hot and have to be
17:53 stored in very specific lead fill
17:55 containers with cement around I mean
17:58 they're they're hot they're SuperDuper
18:01 hot rods just by themselves right it's a
18:06 very dangerous and all this other stuff
18:07 so you can't just go you put it on the
18:09 roof Bob okay min no problem but the
18:12 explosion that happened on reactor 4 was
18:14 this very interesting straight up
18:17 cylindrical fireball that went straight
18:22 up and some bomb experts looked at it
18:25 and said no wait a minute they don't
18:28 have any knowledge of this whole reactor
18:31 being shut down they just looked at the
18:32 footage and went
18:33 something's messed up here that looks
18:36 exactly like a suitcase bomb like a mini
18:38 nuke hmm now I don't personally have any
18:43 knowledge of mini nukes but I did watch
18:45 a piece of test footage that was cut you
18:47 know they split the screen in half they
18:48 did the test footage it's been released
18:50 to the world and then they did the
18:52 explosion to reactor 4 and it looked
18:53 very similar hmm strange now you guys
18:59 may or may not remember but there were
19:00 more earthquakes off the coast down by
19:05 Chile more tsunami warnings and now we
19:10 just have it all the time now earthquake
19:13 in the ocean wave everyone's told to get
19:17 down right
19:18 when did tsunamis get so huge when did
19:21 ocean earthquakes get so huge now maybe
19:23 the earth is expanding and so stuff's
19:25 bumping into each other and this is a
19:27 natural occurrence along the was at the
19:30 the fire rim of the Pacific Ocean
19:33 maybe it's completely natural let's move
19:37 on to a different type of situation then
19:40 we're a loop back and put the weapon
19:42 thing on top of all these little
19:44 scenarios here
19:45 hurricanes hurricanes are out of [ __ ]
19:48 control right it's almost as if the news
19:51 makes them because I'm being facetious
19:53 because they get bigger and bigger and
19:55 bigger more destructive constantly now
20:01 let's go to Katrina which landed on my
20:04 birthday that was a horrendously huge
20:08 hurricane right they kept saying the
20:10 levees might break the levees and might
20:12 break but then you start looking at how
20:14 levees are designed they're very slanted
20:16 you know cement sort of bunkers and
20:19 there's nothing's gonna break right
20:21 [ __ ] water is not gonna make a levee
20:23 break thing is reinforced concrete how's
20:26 it gonna break right but I stayed up all
20:30 night
20:31 in this they were filming Bourbon Street
20:34 with I think it was Fox News was the one
20:36 I was on I slipping through all of them
20:39 right and they gave the coast is clear
20:42 signal storm is inland enough it's
20:45 calming down into a tropical storm and
20:48 Louisiana has New Orleans has survived
20:51 the problem then all of a sudden just
20:55 like a [ __ ] movie with the fall
20:56 sending kaboom
20:58 the levee breaks and all of a sudden
21:00 that that you know sub sea level area
21:03 that the bowl fills up a bunch of people
21:05 hurt a bunch of people displaced Barbara
21:10 Bush gets up there and says well it's
21:11 good for them that they get to move to
21:13 other cities like Texas better believe
21:18 they're so [ __ ] triple K outfits and
21:20 that [ __ ] you know closet was aleister
21:24 crowley's daughter whatever it is so
21:27 then you have two different eye
21:29 witnesses a couple and a guy and they
21:33 were sitting on their porch facing the
21:36 levee I mean they are right next to it
21:38 and they said they watched a helicopter
21:40 come by dropping big bags of what they
21:44 thought was sand to help reinforce the
21:47 levee
21:48 they said the storm had pretty much indy
21:50 because they're sitting on their porch
21:51 okay both of them there there's a little
21:55 street between them so imagine a country
21:57 road between two homes on a corner at
22:01 least that's how they filmed the homes
22:03 when they said that they that's where
22:05 these people were so they may have done
22:06 bad unit two shooting and then I got the
22:09 wrong houses but that's the way it was
22:10 featured to the program and they
22:12 interviewed these people and they said
22:14 then there was a huge bang and the levee
22:17 broke now if the levee did break you
22:20 might hear a big clumpy pop because you
22:22 know somehow cements being utterly
22:24 crushed by water right but they said it
22:28 coincided with the dropping of whatever
22:30 this helicopter was dropping now the
22:33 problem is is it between the three of
22:35 them they may have had a full set of
22:37 teeth so who's gonna listen to them
22:40 right it's exciting to see you
22:44 Anderson Cooper down there and running
22:46 around with all the refugees running
22:48 around trying to find where they're
22:49 gonna stay tonight right so there's some
22:52 interesting side evidence to that stuff
22:55 now tornadoes we haven't had any giant
22:58 cat fives in a while so thank God
23:00 but Joplin Missouri got nailed and I
23:02 want to tell you a little story that I
23:04 was at Havasu Havasu for those of you
23:08 don't know as a man-made lake that it's
23:12 pretty much in Arizona that they just
23:17 created it they move the London Bridge
23:19 there one of them reconstructed it
23:22 beautifully and it goes way north I
23:24 think into Nevada as well Lisa's a
23:27 little harder we can go up and gambol up
23:30 in Laughlin if you're willing to go the
23:33 whole distance but there's a lot of bars
23:34 up and down its California on one side
23:36 and I think Arizona on the other but
23:40 we're out messing around much my buddy's
23:41 a knight and I'm looking up and I have a
23:43 buddy with me at the time who wasn't
23:47 hipped to chemtrails and they were
23:48 spraying the [ __ ] out of the sky and
23:50 I've got a whole photo album of it in
23:53 fact I think it's already uploaded on
23:55 the on the site it may be over named
23:59 Kayla's page on the Facebook page but
24:04 anyway I was telling my friend I said
24:05 you know these are you know coming out
24:08 of these planes and he's like I you're
24:09 full of [ __ ] and I said dude I said the
24:11 biggest problem is and I literally said
24:14 this like verbatim I said 8 to 12 hours
24:19 from now what this is doing to the sky
24:22 and what did this is doing to the the
24:24 weather system could turn into something
24:25 really lethal inland I don't know now
24:30 he's come around so he's no longer a
24:32 denier sure enough within 24 hours
24:36 Joplin Missouri was nailed by a tornado
24:42 that tore out 1/3 of the entire town my
24:46 experience with Joplin is that when I
24:49 would do fireworks as a younger guy we
24:52 would drive to Joplin because they had
24:53 some of the fireworks that were banned
24:55 in Kansas like bottle rockets
24:57 but they also have the best legal
24:59 fireworks for a night show so as I got
25:01 older all I bought was the the big legal
25:04 you know finale kind of fireworks plus
25:08 the prices are great where my mom lives
25:10 in Oklahoma she lives just south of the
25:12 of the huge Tornado Alley that brings in
25:15 all the cat fours and cat fives there F
25:18 f-4s and f5s sorry and we got all the
25:20 terminology mixed up now let's look at
25:24 California 2018
25:26 goddamn fire storm moves through the
25:29 state at the most alarming pace we've
25:32 ever seen some of it is most definitely
25:35 organic and some of it is most
25:37 definitely something else homes are
25:41 burned down to the ground to white ash
25:45 aluminum blocks inside engines are
25:48 melted out on the ground but the car is
25:50 fine on the outside cars that melted to
25:53 the [ __ ] you know molten glass and
25:58 steel and aluminum are right next to
26:00 trees that are just fine
26:03 now I'm not a you know aficionado nor
26:08 have I done any deep dive into what
26:09 actually happens to homes when they
26:11 burned but there were several
26:12 documentaries out there after this event
26:14 where people said people who do obsess
26:16 on this have these libraries of
26:19 photographs of homes that are burned in
26:20 all kinds of different conditions and
26:22 this one woman put together one it said
26:24 look she must be some expert in this
26:28 because she knew all the temperatures of
26:30 which glass melts of which metal melts
26:32 and she said there's no home fire out
26:35 there without some chemical additive or
26:37 some other device where this is going to
26:40 occur where you're going to have all of
26:41 this precious materials melt and like I
26:46 said in one of my last episodes
26:48 there's a house way out in the middle of
26:50 the forest surrounded by trees it's just
26:53 a big service road right to this dudes
26:55 home packed with trees all the way down
26:58 the road and this house burned to the
27:00 ground there's not a single sign of fire
27:03 outside this home the trees around his
27:06 house never caught on fire didn't spread
27:07 and move around but his house was turned
27:09 to white
27:10 well this woman made the point she goes
27:12 houses don't do that houses burn too
27:16 usually you know some black wood is left
27:19 over it usually gets put out by a
27:21 firefighter now we didn't have any
27:22 firefighter assistance in these
27:24 locations you also have a gentleman who
27:28 has done a lot of callin videos for
27:32 blogs and vlogs and and again we don't
27:37 have his face and his name he's not
27:39 exactly rushing to get himself known by
27:42 the authorities because he may have seen
27:44 something that could cause them some
27:46 liability issues we know that there was
27:49 a huge electrical problem where these
27:52 smart meters were just burning on the
27:55 side of homes it's in video go look it
27:56 up so you could overload that thing with
27:59 energy and just start a fire but this
28:02 gentleman he retreated away from society
28:05 he's definitely sort of a survivalist
28:07 so he's easy to call you know a kook but
28:12 he is his thing is that he actually does
28:15 a lot of arts and crafts at his house
28:16 and burning and melting or smelting or
28:21 bending metal was one of his things so
28:24 he had a an area outside of his house
28:27 with a stack of wood and a little brick
28:31 thing is he verbally described it we did
28:33 not see pictures of it but he said he
28:36 came out of his house and he said my
28:39 house was on fire
28:40 well sorry sorry first thing he said was
28:43 he looked outside of his house and he
28:45 could see the fire really far away so he
28:48 goes I got time and he goes didn't look
28:50 like it was coming at me but he said he
28:53 went back in his house to start
28:54 preparing breaking things down because
28:55 he's a survivalist and he said within
28:58 minutes his house was already on fire
29:00 and he looked out and his house is on
29:02 fire his neighbor's houses are on fire
29:05 and that fire that's way over there
29:08 hasn't moved it hasn't come towards him
29:10 yet so that's not the life that's not
29:12 the reason that's not the cause for the
29:13 effect he's experiencing and then he
29:16 looked over at his pile of materials
29:18 that he uses to craft and he said I
29:20 noticed a pile of wood sitting
29:22 completely
29:23 rounded by dirt that was on fire all of
29:27 a sudden maybe I'm dramatizing his lie
29:30 take everything with a grain of salt do
29:32 your own research right he says but I
29:34 have to take that wood put it in my
29:37 stove add fuel to it and it's got to
29:40 burn for a while before it catches on
29:41 fire by itself like a normal fireplace
29:44 he was this [ __ ] is on fire by itself at
29:47 that point he said everything was so on
29:49 fire that he runs to his truck as he
29:53 described it in his opinion he couldn't
29:56 breathe outside as he goes I get in my
29:58 truck I slam the door and I think he
30:01 might have had a pet with him too but he
30:02 said I had enough oxygen in the cabin of
30:04 my truck to drive as fast as I could
30:07 down the hill to get away from this fire
30:09 and he survived now we know a ton of
30:13 people were caught in that there were
30:15 handicapped or elderly they perished the
30:19 worst death that you could possibly
30:20 parish our only hope is that some of
30:23 them suffocated before they got burned
30:25 but we have you know video people
30:28 crawling out of their cars burned on the
30:30 ground just like you know uncle Owen and
30:33 aunt Beru horrific men there's also an
30:40 event that happened in September 2001
30:43 and when this fire thing happened it
30:47 really got a lot of people to think
30:51 about it we'll think about Judy woods
30:53 dr. Judy woods research of weaponry so
30:57 let's get into the weaponry overlay on
30:59 all these ideas in fact let's spice it
31:02 up and we'll go back to the earthquake
31:03 and talk about what that could be
31:06 now above-ground testing for nuclear
31:09 weapons was banned in 1973 so if you do
31:12 it above ground you've committed an
31:14 international felony and there'll be
31:15 troops that most likely show up in your
31:17 country which is why Kim jong-un and the
31:19 lie of him having weapons of mass
31:21 destruction was a complete [ __ ]
31:23 every country that had to prove that
31:25 they had nuclear weapons after 73 had to
31:27 submit ground test videos which is
31:29 Pakistan and India looked very
31:32 convincing but they could have buried a
31:33 bunch of TNT and nobody would know the
31:35 difference
31:36 and even though those extra countries
31:38 have nuclear weapons if you ask the
31:40 official numbers of how many weapons
31:43 they have in that arena it's very few I
31:46 mean like we have a thousand times more
31:47 than they do sort of thing I'm
31:50 exaggerating a little bit
31:51 okay but the idea is that well if you if
31:56 you study let's put this way bikini
31:59 island bursts you have a gigantic
32:02 mistake that they made they were using
32:05 lithium in the composition of the bomb
32:09 and there was one lithium that was
32:11 supposed to be an irk and one lithium
32:13 that was supposed to be part of the
32:14 explosive plug the explosive itself and
32:16 these things are all stacked up on the
32:18 inside of a cylinder so one thing blows
32:20 up blows up the next thing blows up the
32:21 next thing but the one thing that they
32:23 miscalculated was the inert lithium at
32:27 high temperatures loses an electron and
32:31 becomes the explosive stuff and so this
32:34 bomb was supposed to be I think 15
32:38 megatons that ended up being like they
32:39 don't even know they think it's like 40
32:41 to 50 megatons horrendously large bomb I
32:45 think I've got those numbers correct the
32:47 people that were inside the facility
32:49 inside of a cement bunker on a bikini
32:52 Islands this big horseshoe of little
32:54 tiny islands and they put it the
32:55 furthest they could away from themselves
32:57 and they built a cement bunker and put
32:59 the whole detonation Center in there and
33:01 they had a bunch of Navy ships and if
33:03 anything went wrong they were supposed
33:04 to go upstairs on top of the building
33:06 and evacuate with helicopters well they
33:09 blew this thing up and it went
33:13 catastrophic big miscalculation and the
33:16 chemistry of this bomb and obviously
33:18 once you learned that lesson yeah you
33:20 don't make that mistake again and you
33:22 start checking all the other elements
33:24 they're gonna participate in the bomb
33:25 creation to make sure you don't get
33:27 jumping electrons and things go from
33:29 inert to explosive so that might be in a
33:32 lesson that we only needed to learn once
33:33 but it did happen the United States
33:35 military if no other military you want
33:38 to get into it did a tremendous amount
33:41 of water detonations and really learned
33:44 the behavior of bombs under the sea
33:49 way under the sea and so you know what
33:55 if you did bury one well if you put it
33:56 in some device that you know goes down
33:59 by itself with gravity and then just
34:00 drills itself as a particular amount and
34:04 you find a susceptible plate that might
34:06 actually be the the actual cause of the
34:08 event it might truly be this this little
34:11 flipping of plates down there but you're
34:13 gonna cost the flip using a nuke well
34:17 let's just say the Japan story of them
34:22 being extorted for 150 billion dollars
34:24 or more I think the I think my buddy
34:26 said 160 but I'll just roughly keep it
34:28 about hundred hundred 150 billion what
34:32 if that's a way to steal money from
34:33 countries coastal countries well a lot
34:36 of countries have coasts a lot of them
34:39 don't but a lot of them do let's just
34:43 put this way there's not a first world
34:44 affluent countries with coastlines right
34:46 Britain America Japan China India they
34:51 have lots of money Russia the others
34:54 ports that these countries also pay
34:55 attention to which aren't part of their
34:56 country but if those ports don't exist
34:58 they can't export oil and goods so it
35:02 messes up everybody's game and you mess
35:03 with these ports it also didn't hit
35:06 Tokyo so it was like there was like
35:08 potentially a deal of like and you know
35:10 Tokyo could get hit right now it's just
35:13 you know some rural areas in Japan but
35:17 you saw how bad it was right so next
35:19 time we ask you to deposit some money
35:20 maybe you'll just do what we say and if
35:23 you don't have a method of stopping them
35:25 then you can't say anything what are you
35:29 gonna do patrol the ocean a bunch yeah
35:31 this kind of stuff could be done a
35:33 million different ways and you'd never
35:34 find it right drop it from goddamn
35:36 satellite in space deploy it through a
35:39 submarine that goes so far down you
35:40 don't have the equipment to even sense
35:42 it's there something tells me that 2004
35:45 2011
35:46 may have been the test of this equipment
35:50 2004 happens in a very rural area of
35:53 Indonesia so these guys are like yeah
35:57 whatever it's the same kind of generals
35:59 and bankers that manipulated people into
36:01 trench warfare
36:03 they don't care they want to see their
36:05 style work all right now there's another
36:09 methodology that earthquakes have been
36:11 rumored to be created and that is using
36:16 gigantic frequencies that just like
36:21 those old bridges back in the day that
36:22 we didn't build them to withstand the
36:24 frequency of high winds and so you saw
36:27 them you know the bridges go back and
36:29 forth back and forth to find they flip
36:30 in their break right well everything has
36:33 that everything has that vibrational
36:35 frequency that if you can get to it you
36:37 can rip apart the ether winds that are
36:40 the composition of whatever mass you're
36:43 looking at right so a guy named Bernard
36:46 easterland there eastland excuse me
36:49 sorry I'm saying his name right wrong
36:51 EAS tal und you can look him up he
36:56 patented a ton of stuff and then when he
36:59 heard that HAARP was built he which is a
37:02 gigantic array of antennas that uses
37:05 local fuel sources to generate
37:06 electricity and then they it's like a 40
37:09 mile square it was the initial design of
37:13 one it generates this this spiral as I
37:20 understand it of electricity and then
37:22 they can route it straight up and they
37:24 hit the ionosphere and they can hit it
37:27 at an angle
37:27 they can either straight up punch a hole
37:29 and what the patents behind easton
37:34 Eastlands work was which was all lifted
37:36 off of Tesla stuff where because Tesla
37:38 was trying to create a gigantic super
37:39 weapon supposedly at the end of his life
37:41 right and he was going to essentially
37:43 administer it if anybody got out of hand
37:47 or supposedly give it to a responsible
37:49 party that's not nave that guy was which
37:51 means how good-hearted he was but one of
37:54 the patent ideas was he could create
37:55 earthquakes because he could find the
37:57 frequency of a particular plate and
37:59 eventually shake it and how do you find
38:03 the frequency of a plate well you don't
38:05 have to know the science ahead of time
38:06 you simply start resonating that area of
38:10 the world and you start to watch to see
38:12 if the water starts to react because
38:14 you're starting to see
38:15 well it must be the they're getting
38:17 waves on top so we're definitely feeling
38:19 this but a submarine down there and go
38:22 okay start it slow start it slow oh yeah
38:24 we're starting to see movement so you
38:28 could potentially take a volatile area
38:30 of geology these two plates that are you
38:35 know tense and Shake one to the point it
38:39 moves now what seemed almost impossible
38:41 without a nuclear weapon in my opinion
38:44 are some sort of a high end explosive to
38:48 get gigantic pieces of the earth to move
38:51 with just an antenna so I want to let
38:53 you know that I I am definitely not
38:56 convinced that these things can happen
38:59 to be used to do that but you never know
39:02 exponential weapons can do 10 X 10 X 10
39:05 X 2 X and you just never know right now
39:09 let's move to hurricanes hurricanes well
39:15 the weird part about it is we know we
39:19 have weather modification we've had
39:20 weather weather modification for a long
39:22 time
39:23 Eastlands patents were directly
39:25 associated with modifying the weather
39:29 you know what is a cloud what is a high
39:32 pressure system and a low pressure
39:33 system high pressure systems caused a
39:36 lack of rain and usually some fair heat
39:39 low pressure allows a lot of moisture to
39:41 move in and then you get storms which
39:43 reduces heat typically right again these
39:46 the soil of the earth has its own
39:48 ambient temperature that can fight
39:50 anything that's up above so you can have
39:51 the place heated up to 110 degrees for
39:54 two months straight like half a sue and
39:56 then you put in the monsoon and it's
39:58 going to react to this really hot water
40:00 on the ground
40:00 I'm sorry hot soil and ground in
40:03 probably even the water and have a suit
40:05 right but we watch one hurricane after
40:09 another threaten the coast of America
40:11 destroy things
40:13 destroy it's mostly America in the
40:15 entire world right but why don't we run
40:19 a bunch of c-130s way over the altitude
40:22 of these hurricanes and drop whatever we
40:25 need to drop into these hurricanes when
40:27 they're little tiny storms
40:29 to dissipate them to neutralize them I
40:32 don't know exactly the tech but you can
40:35 buy this service for your wedding I
40:37 think it's about a hundred grand is the
40:39 cheapest one you can buy and they'll
40:40 make sure it doesn't rain over your
40:42 church over your reception over your
40:44 photoshoot doesn't seem like a whole lot
40:46 of money right okay those of you are hip
40:50 to chemtrails well we know we have you
40:52 know
40:53 aerosol dispersant technology has been
40:56 patented like crazy so if a government
40:59 needed to protect billions of dollars
41:01 worth of assets and the safety of its
41:04 own people well even if someone is
41:08 seeding these things to exist which we
41:10 have a lot of aerial photographs from
41:12 satellites that seem to support that
41:15 case right bunch of bizarre trails that
41:18 are all flying in a particular direction
41:19 just nudging this thing you know when
41:23 Obama got reelected okay there was the
41:28 the big hurricane that hit New York and
41:31 they said that his response for his
41:33 [ __ ] Wikipedia page it's in his
41:35 goddamn Wikipedia page his response was
41:38 so good that that's what made everyone
41:40 turn to elect the president amen I
41:42 talked to a lot of people who voted for
41:44 that guy ain't no one talked about oh I
41:46 just read the news that day and that
41:48 flipped my vote with that particular
41:51 hurricane I had a lot of seemingly
41:54 chemtrails on the east and west side of
41:57 the thing making sure they were steering
41:59 it the fact that it's never mentioned
42:03 well the president has reviewed weather
42:06 modification technology and they
42:08 determined for a particular reason that
42:11 this is not going to be used you never
42:12 hear that right but you can buy one for
42:15 your wedding hmm well then you have to
42:19 start asking yourself you know who would
42:20 benefit from our hurricane I mean they
42:22 do a lot of damage but it always hurts
42:24 the citizens of the country when people
42:27 I have to insure the damage is a bunch
42:30 of deep State corporations have to pay
42:33 for all this stuff right hmm let's put
42:38 that in our to be discussed pile for
42:41 later in the episode
42:44 tornadoes like I said have largely been
42:47 pretty much under control but they have
42:50 the same exact factors as a hurricane
42:53 stop them the only problem with you know
42:57 tornadoes is that they form very quickly
42:58 and I don't know how fast that we could
43:02 deseed one of these things because it's
43:05 so volatile by the time we know it
43:07 exists we have a debris based funnel
43:11 that's hitting the ground and trying to
43:13 disperse it may cause more problems and
43:15 steer it into some place that wouldn't
43:16 normally hit and because human beings
43:18 have figured out where to build towns
43:20 and we're not to build towns based on
43:22 her or based on tornado damage in the
43:24 past if you steer it one mile to the
43:27 right you could kill everybody that you
43:29 know it's at home we're going to school
43:30 right fires fires comes back around to
43:35 where we were there are something called
43:38 directed energy weapons they do exists
43:40 Rumsfeld admitted I think within a week
43:42 of 9/11 that that those existed he said
43:46 they don't use them they haven't used
43:47 him yet in the theater of war and
43:49 they're not gonna use them until they
43:50 need to and maybe he was bullshitting
43:52 who knows right but being in the video
43:55 game business and working at Electronic
43:56 Arts who acquired Westwood Studios
44:00 Westwood Studios had a video game called
44:03 command & Conquer which a lot of you
44:04 have played this still exists to this
44:06 day but one of the sweetest weapons you
44:08 could get in the game was called an ion
44:09 cannon what was the ion cannon well you
44:13 didn't see it in space in the game but
44:15 there was a little icon for it it was
44:17 this round doughnut shaped structure
44:19 that's put up there next to the Van
44:22 Allen belts and it simply sucks an
44:26 infinite amount of electrons out of the
44:28 Van Allen belts into its bowels and
44:31 coils it up and then discharges all that
44:34 electricity down this chute towards the
44:37 earth and it could scorch the earth and
44:39 kill things in the video game okay so we
44:43 don't know the schematic of what what
44:44 would have been created in the in the
44:47 past I can definitely say you know
44:48 there's lethal laser weapons up there
44:51 they that are up there to annihilate
44:53 ICBMs that drive by that's up there
44:56 already
44:57 but instead of just the command &
44:59 Conquer mechanism which is on we're just
45:01 going to send down a beam to light
45:03 everything on fire from space they can
45:06 use the device to resonate a particular
45:10 material that is fairly unified in its
45:12 chemical composition what's the
45:15 difference between unified and not
45:17 unified well an aluminum block and an
45:20 engine it's probably very easy to
45:22 liquefy from space but a tree would be
45:26 very hard to liquefy because it is a
45:28 varying structure due to its organic
45:30 growth right the rings are different as
45:33 it moves out towards the bark now could
45:37 you do it probably you know when
45:39 lightning hits a tree one of the things
45:42 that I learned from my buddy is a big
45:44 wood Smith he said it boils the inside
45:49 of the tree and when pine trees get it
45:51 all the SAP boils in a split second and
45:54 that tree is basically dead on arrival
45:57 and my uncle had his pine tree struck in
46:01 his backyard my hometown was just it was
46:04 just such a cornerstone of the house and
46:07 it got zapped by lightning and sure
46:10 enough it just died the whole thing
46:11 turned brown and it was probably 35 feet
46:15 tall at least you know you know even if
46:18 you want to bury a replacement it's
46:19 gonna take you know decades to get back
46:21 up to that that size really sad but Judy
46:24 would our woods she has a PhD
46:30 I believe in several different things
46:32 but they believe one of them is if I got
46:35 this correctly one of them was
46:36 metallurgy and she broke down that
46:40 famous day in 2001 and studied a bunch
46:44 of the photographs studied how things
46:46 had basically cookie cutter holes
46:47 punched in them from space and of course
46:50 we all saw the fact that the buildings
46:52 not only fell with ridiculous speed the
46:57 fact that they fell at all was a big
47:00 sign that something else was going on
47:02 but they also fell freefall which means
47:03 something else was going on but for
47:06 those of you who remember World Trade
47:08 Center one that fell first
47:11 it had a tipping top right you saw it
47:14 turn and it fell but by the time it hit
47:17 the ground it was gone it was a
47:20 pyroclastic cloud of all the materials
47:22 that it was made of hmm with the
47:25 secretary
47:26 second tire fell you had a hundred
47:27 stories left I believe that's the
47:30 accurate number 100 stories left in the
47:32 building so they had to destroy 100
47:34 stories we had this huge cauliflower
47:37 thing which is a sign of explosives
47:39 because you have force pushing things
47:41 out all right I could drop this cigar
47:44 right now and at no point is gonna go
47:46 sideways it's gonna drop straight down
47:48 because that's how gravity works right
47:50 sorry flat earthers but you have beans
47:53 inside this tower which simply vanish
47:57 and she did a series and a bunch of
48:00 videos on it I bought a DVD collection
48:02 once which I've donated everything since
48:04 then but you got to watch this this big
48:08 beam I think if one was the antenna and
48:10 it simply fell and then poof it turned
48:14 into nothing dust just blew away amazing
48:19 down below there's other World Trade
48:21 Centers that were all by each other
48:22 little tiny complexes compared to the
48:24 big buildings and one of them is a
48:26 really long building and then by it were
48:29 two other buildings and so what you do
48:31 is you trace down the sidewalk between
48:32 these three buildings and there's like a
48:35 tea formation in the sidewalk about
48:36 halfway down the longer building and
48:39 there was a circle that was cut out of
48:42 all three buildings well there's no
48:44 debris that's gonna fall it's a complete
48:46 donut and there's a bunch of these
48:48 things all over the pile on that one day
48:51 so this leads us to the fires the fires
48:53 in California which again ironically
48:57 cleared the way for the high-speed rail
48:59 I mean it's not perfect but it's a big
49:02 big chunk of the eminent domain
49:05 conversations that are going to occur
49:06 this thing's over budget by you know
49:10 tens of billions of dollars already
49:13 right like they always are a bunch of
49:15 [ __ ] [ __ ] getting in there and
49:16 stealing our money hopefully our
49:18 president will change a bit of that
49:20 houses burned too
49:22 - while having green trees and bushes
49:25 right next to the house undisturbed
49:29 glass and windows melted away hmm that's
49:35 thousands of degrees folks and I'm sure
49:39 there's some circumstances where you
49:40 could get a few trees to fall together
49:42 and it starts creating sort of a kiln
49:44 effect but that's not going to be in
49:47 just ambient air is it the fact that
49:50 everything was on fire very quickly and
49:52 all the surrounding trees were perfectly
49:53 fine where did the fire come from the
49:56 fact that PG&E you know smart meters
50:00 were just burning up like furnaces what
50:03 are you gonna do it's an electrical fire
50:05 and obviously it's being turned on with
50:09 a huge chunk of electricity coming into
50:12 your house so what we gonna do run up
50:15 and cut the power line with the cable
50:16 you'll die no you do get extinguisher
50:19 for electrical fires and sit there and
50:21 just hold it that extinguisher is gonna
50:23 be out in two seconds and the
50:25 electricity is gonna be coming and it's
50:27 gonna continue burning until your house
50:29 catches on fire there you go
50:31 now as I understand it there's a lawsuit
50:34 now that's being put together against
50:38 PG&E I'm not quite sure what the basis
50:41 of it is but at the same time a new tax
50:44 has been approved in California that
50:48 will give PG&E money out of the
50:49 taxpayers dollars what a sweet deal look
50:54 here's what we're gonna do you're gonna
50:55 cause the fire we're not causing the
50:58 fire Jesus Christ will get suit now
50:59 don't worry about that we're gonna have
51:01 a lawsuit we own all the judges so
51:03 you're gonna get the most lenient
51:05 [ __ ] settlement ever but it won't
51:07 even matter because we're gonna start
51:09 we're gonna put this this new tax here
51:12 read this and it's gonna fill your
51:14 company's coffers with more money than
51:15 you could possibly [ __ ] imagine so
51:18 eat the lawsuit no big deal
51:20 you're gonna make a ton of money off the
51:21 people of California yippity-do da I'll
51:26 take that deal now let's study two
51:30 places in California alone that have or
51:35 quake history that if this Fukushima
51:39 thing were to occur the death toll would
51:43 be higher than any single event in
51:47 modern history that we've ever seen
51:50 natural or unnatural San Francisco and
51:55 Los Angeles are known for earthquakes so
51:59 if there ever was an earthquake off the
52:01 coast and it created a huge tsunami well
52:04 99% of the world at this point are you
52:05 gonna swallow that no problem at all oh
52:09 hey it's earthquake country you know it
52:12 was only a matter before those those
52:15 halves got nailed right if you stand up
52:18 on in Los Angeles you go to LMU
52:21 University it's up on a big hill but
52:24 there's a place you can stand on the
52:25 edge and you can look down on Los
52:28 Angeles and Los Angeles way off to your
52:30 right and Santa Monica reaches around
52:33 and touches the coast is sea-level entry
52:36 point if they pop one of these things or
52:39 whatever they're doing to make these
52:41 things occur and a big giant ass wave
52:44 came in especially like Fukushima okay
52:48 you're talking about 60 foot waves okay
52:51 and I thought that that was a bit of an
52:52 exaggeration until I saw this most
52:54 recent footage and man they were not
52:56 kidding right that would wash all the
52:59 way into Los Angeles probably
53:02 potentially I mean there's gonna be
53:04 structures that stop it a little bit and
53:06 slow it down but man just watch japan's
53:08 footage on that one in minutes you would
53:12 have millions and millions of people
53:14 stranded dead it just depends on what
53:17 time of day obviously we would start
53:20 seeing the water go out and so people
53:24 would start trying to rush for higher
53:25 ground we have much better system we
53:27 have warning systems on our phones but
53:30 just the disruption alone would be
53:32 insane right San Francisco is a city
53:37 that is up against the coast of the
53:38 Pacific but it also has underneath the
53:40 Golden Gate Bridge a peninsula that
53:42 comes way inland it goes all the way
53:44 down to San Jose on the inside there's
53:46 four bridges to cross it
53:48 well but if you got peers down there
53:52 right if this place sucked out a bunch
53:54 of water and blew it back inside you
53:56 would have San Francisco flooded all the
53:58 peninsula did it would be catastrophic
54:01 in history would just simply say hey
54:04 it's just an earthquake the reason why
54:07 I'm making this episode is not to freak
54:08 anyone out but one I want you to
54:10 highlight in your brain your research in
54:14 this area go back and look at things the
54:16 fires have been the most well received
54:18 research out there because there's so
54:21 many crazy things that happened happened
54:23 during the fires you know hurricanes
54:25 it's just a matter of cutting out
54:27 service on the internet take a
54:28 screenshot of these services the wipe
54:30 out storms for weddings and then ask me
54:32 while the president United States
54:33 doesn't talk about wiping out hurricanes
54:37 tornadoes I think the only thing you
54:38 could do is start them stopping them I
54:41 don't think you can do that easily fires
54:44 well that can be repeated over and over
54:46 and over again now where the conditions
54:49 absolutely perfect for that firestorm
54:51 absolutely a buddy of mine several miles
54:54 away probably 10 miles away from the
54:56 fire was taking a picture taking a movie
54:58 excuse me of the fire far away and his
55:01 palm trees in his front yard were
55:03 sideways with wind and it was a hot day
55:06 for sure but nothing explains houses
55:10 going down - why - engine blocks melting
55:14 out next to trees and the the specific
55:16 thing is is that to melt an engine block
55:18 the amount of heat you'd have to have
55:19 specifically only on the engine block
55:21 would burn the tree up in two seconds
55:24 the tree would be vaporized you get cars
55:29 melted out on roads where you don't see
55:31 any fire around the car where did this
55:34 fire come from did the guy just drive it
55:35 down the street really half-assed and
55:37 burn up his engine I don't think so so
55:40 there's been this suggestion that that a
55:43 big bunch of amazing things that are
55:46 occurring in the background believe me
55:48 almost everybody I know goes why am I
55:50 still out on this qa9 thing as well as I
55:53 am some people think it's JFK jr. I
55:57 don't think Vincent fusca is any
56:00 indication of JFK Jr's
56:02 whereabouts the soldiers standing in the
56:05 queue formation on the same army base
56:08 where Fort Knox's our naval base or
56:10 whatever it is that's pretty damn
56:11 convincing but regardless the claims
56:15 have been from normal things that we see
56:20 the most human trafficking and
56:22 pedophilia caught in world histories
56:24 happened in the last two years it's a
56:27 daily thing now right it's a great it's
56:30 a great thing we all know that the
56:32 Federal Reserve needs to be shut down
56:34 and get rid of the fiat currency get rid
56:36 of our tits sucking of the the bankers
56:40 in Europe as well as they need to do it
56:42 on their in but we're doing our end
56:43 there's all kinds of rumors of the fact
56:49 that the Federal Reserve has already
56:50 been taken over that they found the gold
56:52 which is part of that Q picture with all
56:54 the soldiers with that pedestrian in the
56:55 front now barring any military garb it
56:57 looks just like JFK jr. age twenty years
56:59 I mean they could be photoshopping the
57:01 guy's head I don't know just to create
57:03 the rumor about it right
57:04 Trump just tweeted something about
57:06 global warming and he left out the AR
57:08 and warming and then he said something
57:12 like where are you we need you to come
57:13 back a lot of people think that's our
57:16 four number eighteen which was attached
57:20 to JFK and some other publications on a
57:22 chain or 4chan but anyway my point here
57:26 is if we are truly gaining control of
57:29 this world the military if Kuna is
57:34 correct is facilitating this the United
57:36 States military's do me an anti coup and
57:39 getting back all of our constitutional
57:41 rights and eventually we'll start seeing
57:42 this plan to turn back into what it was
57:44 before that day in September of 2001
57:48 well at some point we got to make sure
57:52 our military goes after any deep state
57:56 organization that might be using drug
57:58 money or all kinds of other money and
58:02 one of the things it's sort of off-topic
58:04 but it should give you there's another
58:05 theory about how these steep state
58:07 organizations get their cash and I want
58:09 to throw this out to you just in case
58:10 it's true
58:12 you have South American company
58:14 countries and this is just one region it
58:16 happens all over the world but they ask
58:18 for aid and they create either real or
58:21 artificial circumstances where that aid
58:23 makes sense they might let their country
58:25 go into the level of poverty for six
58:27 months and they call the UN and they ask
58:30 for 150 million dollars all the
58:34 paperwork has been prepared to push this
58:36 through all the shells inside the UN say
58:40 yes you get your hundred fifty million
58:42 dollars the theory is that the deep
58:45 state gets a hundred million of the five
58:46 hundred fifty and they give the 50 to
58:48 the politicians that asked for it
58:50 the people see nothing and the
58:52 orchestrated event or the fake event is
58:54 obviously ignored but if it's
58:55 orchestrated poverty the country just
58:57 releases the food releases the oil and
58:59 then everybody's finding in and they
59:01 think it's because they got aid but they
59:03 didn't but the deep state gets another
59:05 hundred million dollars to go play with
59:06 which is sort of pocket change for what
59:09 they need to do but any one of these
59:11 vents may cost less if they're refined
59:14 right weapons of natural destruction
59:17 let's call it that from now on without
59:21 words we cannot describe something if
59:25 you can't describe it it's very
59:27 difficult to conceive of it right we run
59:31 into it all the time when we find
59:32 someone we're in love with or a member
59:35 are suffering excruciating pain of some
59:38 usually mental type you don't know how
59:43 to describe it so no one knows what to
59:45 do well let's start forming words around
59:49 this so that we can describe it to make
59:52 sure it doesn't exist we don't want any
59:55 of this to exist if it's a natural thing
59:58 that's a natural thing as much as I
60:01 tried to scoff at the notion that the
60:05 California fires were anything other
60:06 than fires on a really hot windy day the
60:09 more look of the evidence of these
60:10 photographs and of course we had Santa
60:12 Rosa before that it didn't make any
60:14 sense a lot I witnessed testimony from
60:17 firefighters going in there is just like
60:19 I have never seen thing like this fire
60:21 doesn't behave like this everything
60:23 we've been taught this is a whole new
60:25 book
60:26 on fire when you think this whole thing
60:28 through and of course with all these
60:31 events including that day in September
60:33 2001 the government and the agencies
60:37 that are responsible for protecting us
60:38 always cite one flaw that is responsible
60:41 for all these problems which is
60:44 incompetency but the proof is in the
60:48 pudding and the proof is that that
60:51 that's [ __ ] is that they never fire
60:54 anybody right
60:55 September 11th give me a break NORAD
60:59 calls down all of the fighter jets to go
61:02 scramble against all these planes that
61:04 have been hijacked I had a guy on a
61:07 plane tell me I mean this is how [ __ ]
61:11 complicit we are in this world he said
61:15 oh I understand that I said well why do
61:17 you understand buddy he goes well you
61:19 know those planes break the sound
61:21 barrier and every time they break the
61:22 sound barrier over residential areas
61:25 people sue the government they have to
61:27 pay money I said dude as the stupidest
61:31 [ __ ] idea I've ever heard in my life
61:32 well even if they broke all the windows
61:34 in a house as they pop the mock over
61:37 some neighborhood what's that gonna cost
61:39 a few million dollars to protect the
61:42 country you got four hijacked planes and
61:45 you're worried about I don't know
61:47 well first of all if they truly were
61:49 what they ended up being which is a some
61:51 sort of terrorist activity regardless of
61:53 who did it it's a terrorist activity you
61:56 just walk into court and go this case is
61:58 dismissed really sorry well we won't pay
62:01 for your damages in your brain but we'll
62:03 pay for damages for your for your your
62:07 windows but if you have homeowners
62:08 insurance we're gonna tell them to pay
62:10 you and not raise your rates because
62:12 this was a national emergency this is
62:14 like a global [ __ ] problem and was
62:17 going on if the official story was
62:19 correct right
62:20 don't let that excuse be the excuse
62:23 because it's a bunch of crap you
62:25 remember the the big nuke warning in
62:29 Hawaii what did they say they pinned it
62:32 on some guy a week later said he
62:35 accidentally started this nuke warning
62:37 and freaked out everybody in Hawaii
62:40 then later if you keep reading because
62:42 especially if you follow queue and on
62:44 he pointed you at the at the
62:46 documentation that said that warning
62:49 does not come out of Hawaii that warning
62:52 comes out of a central military
62:54 organization like NORAD they don't have
62:57 the ability to turn it on and they don't
62:59 have the ability to turn it off and the
63:00 thing when I think for like 40 plus
63:01 minutes right something was launched at
63:05 Hawaii that was a real emergency and it
63:09 was knocked out of the sky
63:11 according to q well sold at that kind of
63:15 warning for a really long time and
63:18 consequently I think there was a gag
63:20 pulled in Hawaii I think it was in
63:23 Honolulu I think I got the town right
63:26 where some kid walked around in a cell
63:29 phone pretending that he was hearing
63:31 from his girlfriend that was saying that
63:34 a nuke was coming and he started running
63:36 and everyone else started running they
63:38 thought it was really funny so that was
63:40 a little bit of deep state predictive
63:44 programming or that was just a weird
63:46 coincidence right that need matter what
63:50 city was in same thing right people
63:53 crawling into rain drains and all kinds
63:55 of stuff hmm so as we clean up this
64:00 world that is one thing we got to put on
64:01 our list hopefully it's taken care of by
64:05 authorities that will just take care of
64:08 it and we don't have to do a damn thing
64:09 but if there's ever one of these events
64:12 where it happens again earthquake off
64:16 the coast of a major city city gets
64:18 rammed sacked we need to have our eyes
64:20 open looking at every single thing that
64:23 makes sense and what doesn't make sense
64:24 like Japan again buildings that just
64:27 floated away in two seconds because
64:28 they're not bolted to the ground didn't
64:30 fall over during a 9.0 earthquake when
64:33 you're kidding me Helen 9 is still a
64:36 seven quite quite ways inland right a
64:39 seven will knock down a building that's
64:40 not bolted to its foundation the house
64:43 that I lived in in San Mateo California
64:46 was off cheese if I were to drive to see
64:50 occurs from that house it'd take me 45
64:52 minutes at probably 2:00 in the morning
64:54 with no traffic
64:56 it was far away right if San Francisco
64:59 got a 5.8 then my house probably got
65:04 about a 6 or so so you're telling me
65:09 that well-constructed home that was
65:11 bolted to its foundation got it ripped
65:13 off its foundation cracked in three
65:15 different places in the house crack the
65:17 the fireplace right down the middle and
65:20 I was on a hill that was absorbing part
65:22 of the wave right and somehow Japan
65:25 completely survived most of that damage
65:26 until the wave came the other thing it
65:30 probably goes without saying is if
65:31 you're in a coastal region and you might
65:33 if you're near some port that's of any
65:35 interest to a country you've got an oil
65:37 port or product port or you're just in a
65:39 major city like Los Angeles or San
65:41 Francisco wherever you are definitely
65:43 figure out where you would go if these
65:45 things occur because what if you were
65:48 the product of one of these weapons of
65:50 natural destruction need to make sure
65:52 that you have a very quick escape route
65:55 but now we talked about the promise of
65:58 closing off this episode which what
66:00 would be all the benefits of doing all
66:02 this damage well I think that again
66:06 Indonesia 2004 if they had anything to
66:08 do with what I'm talking about that's
66:10 just the test a bunch of peasants in the
66:14 eyes of the people cattle for the
66:15 slaughter so who cares right but the
66:19 tourists get nailed a screw those people
66:20 I don't think there was any major
66:23 benefit other than to confirm that the
66:24 technology existed again I could be
66:27 wrong maybe it's still in Nashville
66:29 Fukushima hmm a little harder on that
66:33 one thinking it's just a natural
66:34 occurrence but if this money requests
66:37 from the World Bank or IMF or whatever
66:39 it was actually came in to the Japanese
66:41 government prior to Fukushima then it's
66:45 a manipulation mechanism to get a
66:47 country to do what you want it to do the
66:51 other ironic thing is that Fukushima was
66:53 actually one of the number one Gershom
66:56 cancer cure centers in the world and now
67:00 what is it it's ironically a Cancer
67:02 Center I mean it's a cancer-causing
67:04 location in the world so we took out
67:06 they took out one of the most successful
67:08 places with there's like a documentary
67:10 about the place we used to be on Netflix
67:12 they I think the number was like
67:15 eighty-three percent cure rate and said
67:18 the only reason why there was seventeen
67:19 percent left is people come in too late
67:21 hurricanes hmm.well Katrina is probably
67:25 your best example of where the monetary
67:29 benefits come in
67:30 remember all those mobile homes that
67:32 were sold with formaldehyde all
67:34 throughout the the carpeting they were
67:37 never meant to be lived in they were
67:38 just meant to be purchased and delivered
67:41 hmm
67:42 land development is always a big benefit
67:45 of a hurricane hitting the coast you get
67:48 a bunch of land that is ready for the
67:52 buying you know not everybody rebuilds
67:54 there was a bitty BBC documentary on
67:59 Louisiana after New Orleans after those
68:03 after levee broke and they were
68:07 interviewing the gangbangers in there
68:09 and that place turned into a complete
68:10 crazy law of the jungle place and they
68:15 interviewing these bangers that can
68:16 barely speak English and they said look
68:18 if we don't take what we need we'll
68:20 never get what we need that's why we do
68:22 it they also said that a ton of those
68:24 people
68:25 I mean tens of thousands of people never
68:29 moved back what happened to their land
68:32 right easy for the pickings now I
68:37 haven't heard any big giant resorts
68:38 opening up down there maybe you know
68:40 that information but now what if there's
68:42 a deep state layer to the world and then
68:45 the United States of America which is
68:47 now being run by a true American okay so
68:51 you threatened that guy and you make
68:53 these are these hurricanes occur or
68:56 earthquakes or whatever and you simply
68:59 save the government they're sending a
69:01 little letter and they say well we can
69:02 make that happen
69:03 twenty more times this year if you don't
69:05 do what we say your country will be so
69:08 [ __ ] bankrupt your corporations that
69:10 insure this stuff will be completely
69:11 bankrupt it'll screw up your economy
69:13 yeah
69:15 again the problem is we never try to get
69:17 rid of him the fires will president
69:21 Trump walked around all those fires he's
69:24 supposedly according to Kuna and knows
69:26 everything that's going on Jerry Brown
69:30 looked really weird every time he walked
69:32 around at those sites like he was just
69:33 staring at the ground the whole time
69:35 like he saw a dead body for the first
69:37 time in his life now he's been accused
69:40 by people on the internet of of
69:42 participating in the land redevelopment
69:44 of all the fires that have ever happened
69:46 in California last five years that may
69:50 be true that may be not true you didn't
69:52 look too healthy California is a its own
69:57 debilitated country within America
70:00 because it's being run by progressive
70:02 laughs that are trying to destroy
70:04 California
70:06 Sacramento's were all the politicians
70:08 live and so they are very very left even
70:12 though they're kind of in them the
70:14 boonies it's fairly weird but you just
70:17 watch one thing after the other
70:18 outlawing [ __ ] straws but then
70:20 because they care about the environment
70:22 on the other half they allow sanctuary
70:24 cities to exist where you basically
70:27 invite people to be homeless for the
70:29 rest of their lives never really truly
70:30 helping them so anytime we see these
70:33 these contradictions and standards of
70:36 the world we have to step in as citizens
70:41 analyze it the best we can because we're
70:44 never going to get the brochure as to
70:45 what's really going on so we have to use
70:47 our brains our intelligence to look at
70:49 this stuff and just if nothing else like
70:51 I've done in this video propose some
70:54 things to examine and then just keep our
70:56 eyes open when they happen again right
70:59 they will never try to do you know a
71:03 moon hoax again the way they did it in
71:05 the past because they know they blew it
71:07 right so if they ever faked the Mars
71:09 thing which is a big joke they're gonna
71:11 wait till either we're all in shackles
71:13 and it won't even matter or they're
71:17 gonna try to blow up the production
71:18 value and account for everything with
71:22 events like September 2001
71:27 whoa they learned a lot of lessons of
71:29 things they screwed up live on air right
71:31 a chicken from the BBC saying that
71:34 building seven fell 30 minutes before it
71:36 did you know the whole Pentagon debacle
71:39 saying it was a plane but then it's a
71:42 missile and they are erasing all the
71:44 video cameras all the way around the
71:46 facility never using the anti-aircraft
71:47 pop up units that are all around that
71:50 building logic denies their story right
71:56 so we have to be really good at stopping
72:01 them with our own intellectual force
72:04 moving forward now hopefully all these
72:06 things have been fixed these things
72:08 won't occur again
72:09 maybe it's hurricane is too big to stop
72:13 but we do seem to find them as cat ones
72:15 and cat twos in the ocean and you would
72:17 think that with an armada of c-130s
72:20 dropping whatever the hell chemical
72:21 makes that thing go away that you can
72:24 use for your wedding we can do it we can
72:26 absolutely annihilate these storms but
72:29 we don't even try doing any I hope you
72:32 feel me on that please add your research
72:36 to this particular video don't just
72:38 comment I mean
72:39 comment all you want but do me a favor
72:41 it's like go out and find videos that
72:45 are on this stuff fine websites that
72:48 they're involved with the technology
72:50 find the patents that that work with all
72:53 of this technology to see if this is
72:54 even possible because no one would be
72:57 more happy than myself to find out the
72:59 distance this is absolutely absurd and
73:00 cannot occur right anyway if you haven't
73:05 been to deep thoughts radio calm please
73:06 go it's where you can change formats
73:08 from audio to video video to audio
73:10 there's a locked Facebook group which is
73:12 a fantastic way to be with a bunch of
73:14 really cool people and learn a bunch of
73:16 neat stuff and even if the opinion is
73:19 different than your own
73:20 I assure you it'll be the most
73:22 comfortable it's ever been I also have a
73:25 patreon page there's a bunch of new
73:26 folks on there really appreciate your
73:28 support it does go to keeping this thing
73:31 floating so I really appreciate it it's
73:35 also a Twitter page in case you guys
73:36 want to in case you prefer that version
73:39 of being notified about
73:40 episodes so anyway take care of yourself
73:43 in someone else and I've seen the next
73:45 deep thoughts over now
