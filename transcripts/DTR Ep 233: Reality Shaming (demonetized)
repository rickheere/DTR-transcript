00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today we are going to discuss
00:39 something I'm gonna start calling
00:40 reality shaming if you're over twenty
00:44 years old then you have completed the
00:46 majority of your basic education in this
00:48 world and during the course of that
00:51 process I'm sure you were told about the
00:54 story of the Emperor that had no
00:56 clothing it's one of the oldest fables
00:59 it is not as simple as it sounds
01:03 but for those of you who missed it there
01:07 is a parade where the king is
01:10 the Emperor whatever he is walking down
01:14 the street of his subjects his ego is on
01:19 display and a child is watching with his
01:22 parents and the child realizes that the
01:26 king or the emperor has no clothes on he
01:30 is walking straight down the street nude
01:32 and there are people standing around him
01:36 pretending to be holding part of his
01:39 outfit with their hands pacing behind
01:41 him holding his his tails and the little
01:48 boy is confused because everyone else is
01:50 acting like he has clothes on and the
01:53 little boy shouts out mommy daddy why
01:58 doesn't he have any clothes on and then
02:03 everyone does a huge gasp of whatever
02:09 offense surprise
02:12 a little bit of reality from their
02:14 Stockholm Syndrome and then all of a
02:18 sudden everyone can see the fact he
02:19 doesn't have any clothes on and I think
02:23 it's interesting because that story was
02:24 told to me as a kid and I had no motive
02:26 to understand what the hell was going on
02:28 and now in my 40s I say every single
02:33 society gets there every single society
02:37 gets to a point where everyone has their
02:40 head shoved up their ass where they sit
02:45 around in Stockholm Syndrome and it
02:47 really means that they've made a bunch
02:48 of bad decisions in life and instead of
02:52 just acknowledging it and moving on and
02:55 repairing their life they double down on
02:58 stupidity not just ignorance but sheer
03:03 selected stupidity and for the few of us
03:07 that are awake and this day and age at
03:10 least we have the Internet so that
03:12 little kid could go and write a blog and
03:14 say I was just down town my fellow
03:17 countrymen our King doesn't have any
03:19 clothes on ever everyone in Downton is
03:22 pretending like he's dressed we are
03:24 [ __ ] here come and please take this
03:25 place over that's what's happening now
03:28 which is good
03:30 the modern first world countries of this
03:33 planet are back inside that allegorical
03:40 story America Pollan Iceland Russia are
03:47 a few of the countries that have decided
03:50 not to go another round
03:53 we are countries that have said yeah no
03:57 go [ __ ] yourself but we have factions
04:01 within each one of these countries and
04:03 probably the worst one here in America
04:05 where the microscopic cesspool that is
04:12 antifa
04:14 and similar groups funded by George
04:17 Soros moveon.org who take ads out of
04:21 newspapers to come in protest who
04:24 literally gather up in one location
04:26 dressed in nazi outfits and and tief
04:30 outfits get on the same bus go to the
04:32 Charlottesville massacre thing or
04:34 whatever you know the event that
04:36 occurred and they hop out of the bus
04:37 together one playing one side one play
04:41 on the other side to make sure that the
04:43 narrative of fakeness keeps going going
04:45 to make sure that we fight so that we
04:50 will get all disrupted and when the
04:52 stock market crashes they're gonna blame
04:56 it on some Civil War thing you know
04:59 consumer lack of confidence or some
05:01 [ __ ] because they have no excuse to
05:04 crash the economy right now the subprime
05:07 loan scandal was incubated as early as
05:09 2003 with Joe Biden leading the way
05:14 covering up the tracks and the trails of
05:17 what the bankers were gonna be held
05:19 liable for before we get into specifics
05:23 let's just go back to this this thing
05:28 where people are wrong people are really
05:32 [ __ ] wrong but this is called shaming
05:35 reality right why did I call it then
05:40 because this ridicule process is a it is
05:48 a tool
05:50 people like George Soros it's a tool of
05:54 feminists and misguided people it's a
05:57 tool of evil [ __ ] like Hillary
06:00 Clinton ignorant human beings like
06:04 Bernie Sanders it is a tool for them to
06:08 continue getting their way really
06:11 participating very little and what's
06:14 going on the ultimate job for a
06:17 socialist is to get the job and get the
06:20 paycheck do nothing and do whatever you
06:23 want with the money that's a Bernie
06:26 Sanders a guy that didn't get a [ __ ]
06:27 job until he was in his 40s we have
06:30 Jerry Brown here as a governor of
06:32 California another Democratic Socialist
06:35 Lizabeth his daddy most the time live
06:38 with his daddy until he cut
06:39 to office as soon as you got out office
06:42 he wouldn't move back with his daddy
06:43 the guy is a [ __ ] of a person it's
06:47 gonna be a nice cut see episode here
06:49 there's a bunch of kids out there in
06:51 America at least with horrible education
06:55 thus rendering them pretty much idiots
07:00 and I mean scientifically speaking their
07:03 their IQs are extremely low the amount
07:08 of information that has ever passed
07:09 between their ears is very low and the
07:15 weird thing is is they come from fairly
07:16 wealthy families or at least
07:18 middle-class strong families and so the
07:21 parents having created these absolute
07:23 idiots are trying to pay off the mistake
07:26 by subsidizing all of their kids lifes
07:30 and so they're out there able to protest
07:33 right
07:34 but they know virtually nothing the
07:39 average you know 20 year old in America
07:41 today is either highly educated and on
07:44 board with fixing the world thus most of
07:47 you guys who are in your twenties or
07:51 they're out there standing deride at a
07:55 protest and when asked why they're
07:56 protesting they have nothing and I
08:01 mentioned that first before going into
08:03 the shaming part so that you understand
08:05 why the shaming thing which we're going
08:07 to get into is so popular today and you
08:14 know what's really [ __ ] hilarious
08:15 within these groups is that you have a
08:17 group where you know on one half of this
08:21 this unemployable ignorant group of
08:26 human beings where you can't you can't
08:28 have an intelligent conversation with
08:31 these people they use the word like five
08:34 times in one sentence they end every
08:36 statement with a question inflection
08:39 it's the that is a pure sign of someone
08:42 who is ignorant as a human being you're
08:47 illiterate you don't understand how
08:49 you're talking
08:51 you missed the boat when [ __ ] brains
08:55 are being handed out right but on one
08:57 half of this group and they always have
08:59 these contradictory agendas because
09:03 they're all part of doublespeak they're
09:05 all part of a cognitive dissidence thing
09:08 it's all about lying to yourself
09:11 constantly and like I warned everyone
09:13 two years ago once you start lying to
09:17 yourself and you got to watch my
09:18 political correctness episode once you
09:21 allow in some doublespeak lies that you
09:23 deep down inside no or [ __ ] you have
09:26 created a mechanism to be very dangerous
09:30 within your own life talk about you know
09:33 being in a first you know frustration
09:35 dream where nothing makes any sense but
09:38 it's reality and you can't get out
09:39 because everywhere you step and go it's
09:42 just more confusing and more destructive
09:45 that's the youth of today let me give an
09:49 example you got a good portion of these
09:53 sort of social justice warriors
09:55 preaching about going vegan no you know
10:01 that's up to you men but on one level
10:03 you're to be losing a bunch of weight
10:06 because you're probably very
10:08 malnutritioned to be honest only some
10:11 folks know how to pull it off and stay
10:12 healthy but you're completely
10:13 malnutritioned and you're you know
10:16 you're just nearly looking at or
10:19 anorexic because we have these people
10:20 102 Beach and you know Southern
10:22 California here that are recently on
10:24 these [ __ ] kicks and and the reason
10:25 why they get on the kicks is because
10:27 they got fat and they realize when they
10:30 eat nothing they get thin and they think
10:34 thin is healthy now some of them go to
10:36 the gym some of them monitor their
10:38 nutrients and they actually could pull
10:40 it off but I mean it is a [ __ ]
10:41 full-time job to be a healthy vegan I'm
10:44 just telling you right I had 12 extreme
10:48 years of exposure to this when living in
10:50 the Bay Area the very first month I
10:52 lived there my my co-workers were you
10:56 know being fussy eaters it's
11:01 excruciatingly painful but not okay so
11:03 just
11:04 to vegan that's that's the big new thing
11:06 now they want you to eat as much GMO
11:09 [ __ ] vegetables as possible that's
11:13 why this whole thing has a trend on the
11:16 other side you're supposed to get fat
11:18 you're supposed to get fat you're
11:21 supposed to be a fat model it supposed
11:23 to be a fat human being and I don't just
11:26 mean you're a thick person there are
11:28 people on this planet who are built to
11:30 be thick there are gorgeous women who
11:33 are not necessarily overweight they just
11:36 are thicker people them bigger frames
11:38 that's just the way it works you know
11:40 and there's men that are exactly the
11:42 same and you wouldn't call them
11:45 necessarily fat if you understood their
11:46 biology so there's a big difference
11:48 between being fat and being a little bit
11:50 thick but being fat means that you have
11:54 now accumulated more fat in your fat
11:58 cells than you're supposed to have your
12:00 fat cells inside your body will continue
12:03 growing and growing from a microscopic
12:05 level where you can barely see an
12:06 individual fat cell to damn near you
12:09 know a quarter inch in diameter I mean
12:11 it's
12:11 un-fuckin'-believable I talked to a
12:13 bunch of plastic surgeons in my lifetime
12:15 I've got one of my family and they tell
12:18 you look and you can deflate the fat
12:20 cell but the elasticity of the cell
12:23 never really returns back to its you
12:26 know it's tight shape so when you do
12:29 something to your body that actually is
12:31 is against the biological charter of
12:35 your body you are [ __ ] up your body
12:38 right you want to be tough and badass
12:41 and drink alcohol because you think
12:43 [ __ ] somebody cares and you destroy
12:46 your liver and you destroy your brain
12:47 and you thin out your arteries and your
12:49 veins and you're doing it for some
12:51 reason that is you know ridiculous you
12:54 do it too often you really [ __ ] yourself
12:55 up I mean you could do it you know it's
13:00 up to you man but don't blame us for
13:03 acknowledging the fact it's occurring so
13:07 again inside the social justice where
13:09 you're either gonna have some gigantic
13:12 [ __ ] cartoon character yelling and
13:14 screaming who's a hundred and fifty
13:16 pounds overweight I mean
13:17 over any discernable level of you're
13:20 big-boned you know down to your
13:23 absolutely a seated person who can
13:25 barely protest because they have
13:26 virtually no energy they're 22 years old
13:30 and their skin looks like you know an
13:32 old paper bag from Radio Shack or a
13:34 plastic bag from RadioShack they have no
13:37 energy they're docile they're able to
13:40 vote for people just because they don't
13:43 have any energy to [ __ ] think all
13:46 right they don't have any aggressive
13:47 gene against oppression and they get the
13:53 extra flow I toothpaste you know you
13:57 know I always tell you guys I come from
13:58 a whole little hometown right the reason
14:01 why I always mention that is that
14:02 there's a different way to live in those
14:07 towns the nice thing about a little town
14:11 in the Midwest
14:12 is if we don't do a lot of bullshitting
14:16 where do you think your humble narrator
14:18 got his attitude from we call a spade a
14:22 spade
14:23 it's shittin its shinola the reason why
14:31 communities that communicate well are
14:35 typically pretty healthy folks is that
14:40 we don't have the television and the
14:42 news and some goddamn you know you know
14:47 racist party that claims to be against
14:50 racism you know a militant group of
14:53 people that claim to not be militant and
14:55 to be against militant people coming in
14:59 and providing the brochure to [ __ ]
15:01 each other and ourselves right so no one
15:04 infiltrates a little town and says oh
15:06 this is how you [ __ ] yourself okay
15:08 you know and you see that woman who's
15:09 900 pounds you just think of her as 90
15:12 pounds
15:13 that doesn't happen people in the
15:15 Midwest would be utterly hilarious to
15:19 see what they would do to a person like
15:20 that and I does sneak in right now the
15:24 other bummer is that everyone has a
15:26 right of passage right all the little
15:27 kids have right of passages and
15:29 typically right a passage means
15:31 you know [ __ ] the police which could be
15:33 just your mother your father and so then
15:35 you're trying to go against the grain
15:36 you're trying to piss off your parents
15:38 and unfortunately George solace is right
15:40 there with his you know child
15:42 trafficking ring and his he's horrible
15:46 agendas right mystery kid walks straight
15:50 into the bus ticket to rape Ville you
15:53 know if someone became extremely obese
15:58 not just use this as an example in my
16:00 home town people would talk and they
16:03 wouldn't necessarily talk from a
16:05 ridicule standpoint they would talk from
16:07 a standpoint of oh my gosh what's going
16:09 on here
16:09 is she okay is he okay they're taking
16:12 medication makes them swell up like
16:13 Elvis before he died and then people
16:16 would step in and try and help because
16:20 that's humanity right right now we have
16:23 this really odd ability for a bunch of
16:28 idiots to congregate and they are trying
16:32 to manipulate the rest of us with our
16:34 heads firmly out of our asses by using
16:37 the words shaming you're shaming a
16:41 person when all you these people are
16:43 typically doing is just acknowledging it
16:46 that's all they're doing what does
16:50 anyone change anything in life because
16:53 they've decided they don't like the old
16:54 way enough a negativity gets associated
16:56 with someone's weight that they lose
16:58 weight it's you know like a psychologist
17:00 will always tell you the individual has
17:02 to choose it for themselves in my
17:04 experience there's definitely some
17:06 social normalities and norms that help
17:11 me figure out what is going to be okay
17:14 for me it does help but we are at a
17:17 point now where we are you know well
17:21 there I should say this there's a group
17:22 of folks that are very tiny but they
17:24 have all the [ __ ] press in the world
17:25 which is just a big giant magnifying
17:27 glass on a [ __ ] tick of society which
17:31 makes them look a lot bigger but they
17:34 are trying to make it illegal morally
17:37 illegal for you to acknowledge reality
17:45 they're trying to use tribalism to scare
17:49 you into submission I'm going to give
17:53 you a real world example here we have a
17:56 listener that recently was gang stalked
17:59 by an Tifa and I was fortunate enough to
18:05 have them he and his girlfriend reached
18:07 out to me and we sort of talked it over
18:10 he had a job for 10 years he's in Omaha
18:14 Nebraska and Tifa got ahold of him they
18:18 don't know who the hell he is they just
18:19 have a bunch of stupid incidental
18:21 information about the guy but they took
18:25 every single event of his life and just
18:30 twisted it in some blog the someone at
18:35 his work I guess was notified of this
18:37 there was a part of this it sort of
18:40 makes me feel like the guy that was that
18:43 his work is just a hunch may have been
18:45 involved with these [ __ ] it's just
18:49 like the [ __ ] Inquisition people
18:51 we're gonna review that little nightmare
18:53 so you understand why antifa is you
18:56 wiped off the face of the [ __ ] planet
18:58 I don't know what's worse a Muslim
19:02 terrorist or antifa member because
19:06 they're [ __ ] with the fabric of your
19:07 reality and if you don't realize that
19:09 then listen up folks listen up because
19:14 you have a bunch of misguided
19:15 [ __ ] messing with people's
19:17 lives so this poor guy has has a job for
19:20 10 years some prick at his business ran
19:26 to the boss with this information
19:28 sounds like the [ __ ] involved right
19:31 and gets him fired now the employer did
19:36 not do in the investigation the employer
19:39 simply took in a ques accusation through
19:42 a third party and fired this guy talk
19:46 about a bunch of [ __ ] no I shouldn't
19:49 should be a little more lenient because
19:50 maybe they hire him back but they fired
19:52 him after 10 goddamn years he doesn't
19:54 get any
19:56 questioning he doesn't get any chance to
19:59 tell his side of the story there is a
20:03 reason why we have rights in court
20:05 there's reason why we have the right to
20:08 legal representation because without it
20:11 the world immediately sucks the world to
20:16 returns to law of the jungle whoever has
20:19 the biggest stick right and that's where
20:23 you're going if you let these [ __ ]
20:25 remotely influence the way we live our
20:28 lives now I was also told that the guy
20:32 that wouldn't told on him little
20:34 tattletale [ __ ] that he was he also got
20:36 fired too
20:37 so the company just basically said we're
20:40 getting rid of both of you we're not
20:41 gonna listen to your case and so then
20:45 boom boom clean your hands the legality
20:48 of the whole thing is over can you
20:52 believe that
20:52 look can you believe that that would
20:54 ever happen anywhere after a person's
20:55 been on board for ten years you want to
20:59 shame somebody shame the [ __ ] out of
21:01 this place obviously I can't mention who
21:05 they are because then get into problems
21:10 but it didn't stop there you went off to
21:14 another employer who had worked for
21:16 previously and have been kind of
21:18 part-timing with because there's plenty
21:19 of room in his schedule for it gets
21:22 hired within four hours starts right
21:24 back up again everything's fine
21:26 somehow again there must be an insider
21:30 is all I could think somehow the story
21:32 leaked over to the new people and they
21:35 gave him a call and said you know you
21:41 know you have to come into work still
21:43 can we I don't really know if they're
21:45 gonna actually completely terminate him
21:46 on the second job but look at the
21:48 [ __ ] Lucia this situation one of the
21:53 most [ __ ] things when I was a kid
21:55 we're just gonna let this one roll today
21:56 is that when I was a kid in junior high
22:02 in high school they had this policy that
22:05 if you got in a fight you were suspended
22:09 sounds good right except that the poor
22:12 bastard who gets picked on the innocent
22:15 guy that didn't do a goddamn thing but
22:17 stand outside while the teachers weren't
22:19 paying attention to the [ __ ] bully
22:22 he gets clocked in the face and he gets
22:25 suspended too
22:26 oh yeah maybe the kid who did it gets
22:30 seven days but the kid who gets punched
22:32 in the face gets three days with all the
22:34 penalties of not being able to go to
22:36 class to being stigmatized as some
22:39 delinquent it goes into kid's permanent
22:42 record until he graduates high school
22:44 bunch of teachers go yeah be careful
22:47 that guy he always gets in fights it's
22:49 like no he doesn't he stands there
22:52 innocently and being the kid who walked
22:53 into several different schools you know
22:56 I personally had to deal with this crap
22:58 and you had to take the fight around the
23:00 corner so that nobody would you know so
23:03 you wouldn't get suspended just to
23:05 defend yourself against some [ __ ]
23:06 right and then we had a kid that I
23:10 talked about on the episodes he was
23:12 mentally abused as a kid he could
23:17 benchpress 240 pounds in eighth grade
23:19 all right he was a big [ __ ] and
23:23 he was just mentally damaged he was
23:26 mentally tortured as a child he
23:28 eventually hung himself at some juvie
23:30 hall which probably means someone killed
23:32 him but he just hated being in his own
23:36 body I guess if he did kill himself but
23:39 they just set him loose on us why
23:41 everyone gets suspended of this kid
23:43 fights right so that's what's going on
23:48 with this this whole shaming game it's a
23:53 technique for people to make you
23:55 submissive remember when we did the if
23:57 being offended episode there's a
24:00 difference between being angry and being
24:02 offended children who are [ __ ]
24:05 manipulative they get offended because
24:08 mommy and daddy teach them that if you
24:10 can if you can cry heavy enough then you
24:14 get to extort behavior out of other
24:16 people right being offended which is
24:19 what the whole
24:21 also justice warrior and Tifa movements
24:23 all about these weak little [ __ ] who
24:27 show up in there you know they're
24:29 cloaked [ __ ] you know outfits and
24:30 stuff right but they're trying to teach
24:33 us all to be so fragile because so they
24:35 can manipulate you for free for
24:38 absolutely free and one of my partners
24:42 tell me once he goes you know the
24:43 there's a few factions in the world to
24:46 believe that the best deal you could
24:47 ever make is the one where you get
24:49 everything for free and you use guilt as
24:53 the mechanism to get things for free if
24:57 you study history and you think about
24:59 that algorithm you will know who I'm
25:00 talking about the guilt trip part of
25:04 society to give them something for free
25:07 based on usually a [ __ ] ton of lies and
25:10 that massive algorithms being used on a
25:14 micro level inside society now let's
25:17 flip over to the other side we're very
25:19 quickly here what am I saying am i
25:22 saying that everybody should be
25:23 offensive and just speak their mind
25:25 constantly and when you happen to walk
25:27 in line at the at the grocery store and
25:30 someone in front of you is 200 pounds
25:31 overweight you're not supposed to you
25:34 know or we're saying that they should be
25:36 able to say whatever they want to say
25:37 god you're fat what the hell is wrong
25:39 with you what do you eat bah bah bah no
25:43 all right but what I have noticed is
25:49 that there are several examples where
25:52 individuals are simply just saying in a
25:56 conservative way just acknowledging a
25:58 person's attributes it's so bad that if
26:03 someone is a homosexual that someone
26:05 else mentions in the conversation that
26:07 they're homosexual then all of a sudden
26:08 this red you know alarm goes off you
26:11 can't mention the fact he's a homosexual
26:13 why he doesn't really have any problem
26:15 with it that's who he is that's who she
26:18 is all right hey one of my friends who's
26:23 a black guy he was talking about the the
26:26 problem with conversations because he
26:29 was out with his family and he was
26:31 trying to
26:32 identify where he was in the crowd he's
26:36 on his cell phone and he brought it up
26:39 that you know there's been a bunch of
26:42 debate about whether or not you should
26:43 ever say a person's color which isn't
26:46 really black of course but someone's
26:49 color to signify who you were talking to
26:52 in a group of people so if you had a
26:54 white guy and a black guy and you want
26:56 to tell a third party who you were
26:58 talking to in this crowd you could say
27:02 you know see they're the same height
27:03 they're the same build maybe they even
27:05 have the same damn name two bills or
27:08 whatever right but you're trying to make
27:10 sure that what person understands and he
27:12 was saying you know you know at first
27:16 there was a point in his life where he
27:17 got frustrated that someone would say
27:19 the black guy or the white guy I'm stuck
27:22 into this black guy and he's like why I
27:24 got to say it's black why do you see a
27:26 person's black just just say you're
27:27 talking to a guy so he lived a few years
27:30 like that probably half a decade trying
27:32 to police the race and then he said he
27:34 caught himself with his own family
27:37 speeding things up in a crowd like a
27:39 Disneyland crowd by saying yeah you know
27:43 I'm over by the Mexican guy I'm over by
27:45 the white guy with the red shirt that he
27:48 was using colors obviously to create
27:51 better symbolism for the brain to locate
27:54 him in the park and he finally gave up
27:58 on the whole notion that he should be
28:00 rolling around in some PT a police
28:03 outfit trying to make everyone wrong all
28:07 the time and then he reflected back on
28:11 the 70s when we all got along man right
28:15 we had you know Richard Pryor helping us
28:19 all sort of exhaust our cultural
28:22 differences and laugh with each other
28:24 not at each other right the whole world
28:27 is based on a bunch of principles which
28:29 essentially says leave me the [ __ ] alone
28:31 and I'll leave you alone that's what the
28:34 world is built on that's common law do
28:36 no harm is the friendlier way to say it
28:40 but what are we allowing to occur we are
28:44 allowing complete
28:46 lunacy to occur on a daily look daily
28:50 basis now right we're always looking the
28:53 other way
28:53 constantly look at Europe there is a guy
28:58 now I want you to imagine the European
29:01 Muslim invasion right because they're
29:04 not part of the EU right the Middle East
29:07 is not part of the EU they do not have
29:08 passports to say come on in we're all
29:10 one family
29:11 these are immigrants they're moving
29:14 through borders illegally claiming
29:15 heritage that is 96% inaccurate right
29:19 only 4% of these folks are from Syria
29:23 it's usually military males bringing a
29:27 form of belief system which is only a
29:29 few hundred years old maybe a little
29:32 over a thousand years old or whatever
29:33 but it has an intellect that is
29:38 thousands and thousands of years in the
29:40 past where like Milo says you know the
29:44 women are persecuted it takes two women
29:46 to make an opinion of a man if you're
29:47 lucky the women are castrated the
29:49 homosexuals are stoned to death I mean
29:52 it is an unbelievable thing 80 year-old
29:54 men can have sex with girls of any age
29:58 of any [ __ ] age and yeah goes right
30:03 back to being basically a female who is
30:06 alive as a baby is fodder for this group
30:09 do you want it you can have it
30:11 so freeze that in your head there is a
30:16 video that's gone viral all over the
30:18 internet and it has a gentleman at a
30:20 presentation most of you seen this he
30:25 has the cylinders of bubble gum and the
30:29 bubble gum represents a quantitative
30:32 unit of the population of this world and
30:34 in this thing he's got you know the
30:37 United States all of Europe and then
30:40 everybody else all these third-world
30:42 countries right now Austria must be
30:43 somewhere in there and he says you know
30:47 let's take I think one of these is like
30:49 a million people or something like that
30:51 he goes the lunacy that Europe and
30:54 America and Australia can absorb
30:59 the world's population that is living in
31:01 abject poverty is utter lunacy and he
31:05 starts moving marbles and he starts
31:06 moving you know ten times the amount of
31:09 people that we've actually migrated into
31:11 Europe already then he moves a hundred
31:12 times the people into Europe and you
31:14 realize that more than 80% of the
31:16 world's population is still sitting in
31:18 these canisters so he proves beyond the
31:22 shadow of a doubt right in front of your
31:23 face that we cannot absorb all the
31:26 third-world poverty into the first world
31:28 realm we have to go and help them fix
31:30 their world where they are and yet you
31:34 have people in Europe this is amazing
31:36 I've got dozens of stories at this point
31:39 one degree away from the individual who
31:41 went over and experienced it for
31:43 themselves from from people that can
31:46 actually live in America that can pass
31:48 for foreigners from other countries
31:49 because they're not natively American
31:51 which is a great way to get an
31:53 infiltrator in there because they think
31:55 they're talking to someone from China
31:56 they think they're talking to someone
31:57 from Canada or India but they're
32:00 American citizens and so all this kind
32:02 of hatred for America comes just spewing
32:06 out but I've got it from ultra
32:11 millionaires down to normal people going
32:13 over and hearing all these backs
32:15 backdoor conversations about what a
32:17 bunch of [ __ ] we are in America now
32:21 once you see this guy's demonstration of
32:22 the marbles I'll try to link down below
32:28 you know that the people in Europe are
32:30 completely full of [ __ ]
32:32 they are literally subsidizing
32:35 individuals that will never integrate
32:37 into their society in fact they
32:39 outwardly preach if there's one one
32:41 thing I totally respect about all of all
32:45 of these Arabs moving into Europe is
32:48 that they're at least telling you the
32:49 truth about what they're gonna do
32:51 I kind of like that they're like we're
32:54 getting rid of all of you we're getting
32:56 rid of you racially and we're getting
32:58 rid of you
32:59 genetically you're going away and we're
33:02 gonna change any one of you who manages
33:04 to survive which we're not intending on
33:06 letting any of you live they're gonna
33:09 have to obey Sharia law hey at least
33:14 they're helping you you know know thy
33:16 enemy it's just a doctrine difference
33:20 right
33:21 but somehow Europe who has been bred to
33:25 be surface right the interesting thing
33:28 about the formation of America and you
33:30 know please forgive me because I know
33:31 there's a lot of Europeans are like we
33:32 are not with them [ __ ] this you know
33:34 we're different well then we're on the
33:35 same page right I don't think anybody
33:38 would believe different than the overall
33:41 arc of the show in general would be
33:43 listening but the people that had the
33:46 total disgust and aggression to escape
33:51 oppression moved to America they said I
33:56 can't be ruled by a monarchy and I can't
34:00 be ruled by ignorance and a dr. nation
34:03 now they get on a boat and they come
34:06 over here and they realize that there's
34:07 more you know different forms of a dr.
34:09 nation over here in America so they
34:11 don't completely escape but overall they
34:12 don't have any king and queen on their
34:14 [ __ ] money over here men we have
34:17 presidents that we honor because they
34:20 helped put this place together they
34:22 suffered the slings and arrows of all
34:24 craziness fighting wars and
34:27 what-have-you and some of them were
34:28 shells some more double agents like
34:31 Benjamin Franklin but what that did was
34:34 that left behind the folks that were
34:36 okay with oppression education with
34:39 oppression they were able to always
34:42 rationalize away being oppressed and
34:46 then that genetic strand over there
34:50 concentrated by inbreeding with itself
34:52 to the point where each generation after
34:55 is more docile than the next right and
35:00 to get to the point where you living in
35:02 some thx 1-1 3-8 world but you just wear
35:04 normal clothing
35:06 the fact that Germany was at a point in
35:09 the 30s where they wouldn't take [ __ ]
35:11 from anyone and they rose up and they
35:13 created this crazy army and did all this
35:14 crazy stuff but today they are
35:16 absolutely the epitome of bending over
35:20 for crazy Merkel of all people an East
35:25 German [ __ ] communist runs the goddamn
35:30 EU unbelievable the tech had ever
35:33 happened right I mean you take whatever
35:36 repression you thought you had from a
35:38 monarchy and you look at the EU on top
35:41 of this thing it is bankrupt - every
35:44 [ __ ] country in Europe Germany's
35:47 bankrupt Spain is bankrupt France is
35:49 bankrupt
35:50 Italy's bankrupt Greece was already
35:54 bankrupt right now they're trying to
35:57 punish you know England for getting out
35:59 of the EU through brexit unbelievable
36:04 it's an IQ test all right
36:08 it's an IQ test to see if you have the
36:12 wherewithal to maintain your identity as
36:15 a human being I forgot who said it but
36:19 someone said you know I think Gandhi had
36:21 repeated this line but I'm sure he
36:22 didn't write it but the truth is the
36:24 truth whether you like it or not and
36:27 that is the Occam's razor mantra that I
36:31 think that all of humanity should be
36:32 into you know in my family my surnames
36:39 out of the family we kept it real if
36:43 there's no way this could easily happen
36:45 but if you were to become an alcoholic
36:47 or if you were to get obese or be a jerk
36:51 or whatever you're doing something
36:53 stupid it was the dinner table it could
36:56 be Thanksgiving dinner and it's all
36:58 coming out to make you realize look our
37:05 surname means something we don't do this
37:07 we do this that's easy right eating pies
37:11 every day and gaining weight that's easy
37:14 not eating the pie and going and
37:16 exercising and reading a book
37:18 come intelligent that's hard and that's
37:20 what we do there is nothing more
37:24 energizing in the world than making
37:26 yourself an amazing human being if you
37:29 have the wherewithal to create offspring
37:32 and teach them well what made you what
37:35 you are
37:35 that's another beautiful thing that
37:38 occurs in the universe is to create
37:40 better people so I love seeing really
37:42 good-looking couples and I don't
37:44 necessarily mean cosmetically
37:45 good-looking but really good couples
37:47 that seem to get along and just love
37:50 each other properly there's a good
37:51 balance hey you know nothing's perfect
37:53 but overall even when they hit an
37:55 obstacle they recover well I love those
37:57 couples I love seeing them and I just
38:01 think make kids men make babies we need
38:05 more people make sure you pass on how
38:07 you got there a lot of times those
38:10 couples will create kids and just don't
38:11 know how they got where they are but
38:13 once you pay attention to how you got
38:14 where you are you can pass it to another
38:16 human being so I saw a series of YouTube
38:18 videos my friend was playing yesterday
38:21 and it was people going down to antifa
38:28 rallies before the election was complete
38:31 I think and even after was a complete
38:33 and all these people are standing in you
38:36 know lines and protesting and then these
38:38 people would walk up to him and say why
38:39 are you protesting and I was like half
38:43 of them didn't know how to talk which i
38:45 think is funny right
38:46 that one little brain cell in their head
38:49 is just exhausted from over taxation or
38:53 standing in line and then the other kids
38:56 that would pipe up and really try to say
38:59 something you you would discover in five
39:03 seconds that these kids who run in their
39:07 mouths are the dumbest [ __ ]
39:09 that the world has ever made and you can
39:12 tell they've come from families with
39:14 money because obviously they don't have
39:16 any jobs right if they have college
39:18 education I don't know what janitor's
39:21 closet they hid in the entire time but
39:23 they missed it when asked why they hated
39:26 Donald Trump nothing just propaganda no
39:30 facts about anything
39:31 just every little sound bite every
39:34 accusation without any conclusion I just
39:37 kept stringing it all together and when
39:39 you remind them that those are all
39:41 [ __ ] pieces of propaganda that
39:44 completely fizzled out even in the
39:47 mainstream press it fizzled out oh boy
39:49 then you've hurt their feelings because
39:51 you've said that the emperor has no
39:53 clothes and they keep trying to say he
39:55 does and they're stuck in a Stockholm
39:59 Syndrome where they have been held
40:01 captive by their ignorant brains and
40:06 they don't want to go off and learn
40:09 they've already got their hundred
40:11 thousand dollars worth of debt from
40:12 college they came out with no ability to
40:15 be employed and they are pissed and they
40:18 should be pissed but instead of yelling
40:21 at other humans that are just trying to
40:24 live a good life and trying to you know
40:27 bring back some goddamn jobs to this
40:29 country and get rid of Common Core
40:31 education and take care of veterans and
40:33 everything else that's good that's going
40:34 on in this country right now they're
40:36 trying to attack everyone who's trying
40:38 to help instead of going back into the
40:40 educational institutions and saying you
40:42 robbed me
40:45 you're propped up as my hero as the
40:47 educational college or whatever that
40:50 took my money and what I got was [ __ ]
40:54 how can you create a degree for instance
40:57 in an art that doesn't employ alright do
41:02 you have some I met a woman once it had
41:05 am a PhD in Chicano Studies but she
41:11 worked in HR because there's no job for
41:15 that you could only go out and reteach
41:18 it well if you're doing a cultural
41:24 curriculum then it's time sensitive
41:28 because the world of Chicanos in 20
41:33 actually say you know the mm was
41:37 different than it was in the 20th
41:39 century versus the 21st century versus
41:41 the 18th century 19th century or
41:43 whatever right so what you have has got
41:45 expiration date on that immediately so
41:48 now what are you doing teaching Chicano
41:49 history but these kids get whatever
41:53 degree they can because they also don't
41:56 go to college went by ten to get to
41:58 college they have such low GPAs because
42:01 the common core thing left them you know
42:04 sucking air that they can't qualify or
42:08 pass a normal employable trade skill and
42:13 because working in general has been
42:15 deprecated out of society because
42:17 staring at telephones is the most mind
42:19 taxing experience of a youthful person
42:21 today when it says now you got to really
42:23 concentrate to get a job you got to
42:26 concentrate to keep the job you know
42:29 whatever you're doing it takes more than
42:31 ten minutes to complete a real job a
42:35 real trade skill like I've said in
42:39 several episodes the world has been run
42:40 by a bunch of [ __ ] children for a
42:43 really long time and the only parents in
42:46 the previous domain of the world have
42:48 been banker parents people who are
42:51 interested in pure control and so they
42:55 get a bunch of you know disenfranchised
42:59 people and they get them all exacerbated
43:04 to give him a paycheck to backstab
43:06 humanity and you get a Hillary Clinton
43:09 right the fat nerdy girl who's smart but
43:15 just loathes society because she was
43:17 never accepted and so her whole
43:19 sociopathic arc in life is to get back
43:21 at society you know there's two or three
43:25 Secret Service books about her and the
43:28 one telling thing about Hillary Clinton
43:30 is that they said that a lot of Secret
43:32 Service people would say you know good
43:35 morning madam Clinton whatever the [ __ ]
43:37 they say and she would say oh go [ __ ]
43:40 yourself it was like a daily ritual and
43:45 she was just disrespectful as it could
43:48 possibly be to the people that are there
43:50 to save her life
43:52 and all I can say is Wow
43:56 have you ever done something so
43:59 disgusting in your life someone showing
44:03 you respect someone is actually
44:04 responsible for saving your life and you
44:07 take it to 11 right you are so utterly
44:11 disrespectful to that person that why
44:13 would they possibly help you stay alive
44:16 by the way that little clicking noise
44:18 chirping noise in the background as a
44:20 hummingbird doing his thing it sounds
44:24 like a video game sounds like a little
44:26 some sort of asteroids video game so
44:30 what do we do what do we do about this
44:33 whole thing well the first thing I want
44:36 to remind you is let's keep some
44:38 perspective here the individuals who are
44:41 gang stalking are actually breaking the
44:42 law so at some point they're gonna cross
44:44 lines and there's gonna be federal
44:46 marshals on their doorsteps it will
44:48 happen and they're gonna be hauled away
44:50 in handcuffs just like people who have
44:52 checked fraud because they're engaging
44:55 in slander and luckily you know for them
44:58 they're picking on people that are
44:59 understanding more than they are but
45:03 eventually they're gonna [ __ ] with
45:04 someone who's got money technique big
45:09 ass attorneys and again they're all
45:11 going to get served papers and they're
45:14 all going to go to jail and they're all
45:16 gonna be felons and they're all gonna
45:17 lose their right to vote and so won't
45:19 matter how their opinions differ they're
45:21 gonna be extracted from the society that
45:26 actually knows how to get along if you
45:29 had 350 million people in the United
45:32 States of America I am willing to bet
45:35 you have less than a million people who
45:39 are part of these groups who have the
45:40 ability to protest and still pay their
45:44 electricity bill like allow these people
45:46 live with mommy and daddy so a couple
45:49 years from now they're gonna have to get
45:51 kicked out of their house most likely
45:53 and they're gonna have to get jobs and
45:55 this shit's gonna seem really old you
45:58 know anyone who sits there and complains
45:59 and complains and complains eventually
46:02 no matter if they're right or not
46:03 society says shut the [ __ ] up
46:05 would you you know we're sick and tired
46:09 of your [ __ ]
46:10 you know there's there's [ __ ] that
46:12 just complain and there's people who
46:14 actually try to fix things but when
46:16 you're completely misinformed about how
46:18 the world works and what is actually
46:19 going wrong you can't deal with an issue
46:22 you just go on personal attacks
46:23 constantly that's all it's going on in
46:26 this country you know you want to change
46:28 the world one for office [ __ ] go run
46:32 for office and change things you know
46:34 just do City Council stuff first and
46:36 move yourself up the state level
46:38 position become a congressman or House
46:40 of Representative and eventually you'll
46:42 be able to change the world but they
46:46 don't have the IQ to pull it off and
46:50 that's the funny thing they are stuck
46:52 with a glass ceiling they can't see and
46:54 it's going to be a glass ceiling that
46:56 keeps them from getting employed as well
46:57 and that's why they have all the time in
47:00 the world to harass people with jobs but
47:05 we're gonna have to intellectually fight
47:06 back against these douchebags we're
47:09 gonna have to say look you've got the
47:11 unemployed ignorant human beings of the
47:13 world sitting on line gang stalking the
47:16 intelligent employed people of the world
47:18 and we have to make sure that any
47:19 corporation or private employer that
47:22 falls for this [ __ ] and punishes the
47:25 person with an employable trade skill to
47:27 appease those that are sucking socialism
47:30 welfare that that's the game that you
47:34 can't do that
47:36 or we won't shop at your [ __ ] place
47:40 all right I think the employer who let
47:42 go or listener I think we should do
47:46 whatever we can to make sure there's no
47:47 business going to that place until they
47:49 reverse their stance on it because they
47:54 are showing that their corporation
47:55 without a single iota of humanity
48:00 they're not willing to investigate the
48:02 fact that hey I talked to this listener
48:05 and you know he said look even if they
48:06 could make a case I'd feel a lot better
48:07 getting fired if they could talk to me
48:09 right do you want children to run this
48:13 [ __ ] planet
48:14 is that what you want right obviously
48:17 it's a rhetorical question for anyone
48:19 listening to this particular show but
48:21 just in case that hasn't crossed your
48:22 mind
48:23 let's get very black-and-white with it
48:25 do you want children making policies
48:29 about when you go to bed what food you
48:32 should eat what constitutes a job you
48:36 know I'm very close to the entertainment
48:38 industry I mean I'm in it but there's
48:42 all of this talk just to give you a
48:44 metaphorical example of how bad the
48:46 world could get people aren't going to
48:50 movies anymore the studios have utterly
48:54 replaced people with film degrees with
48:59 executives that have no film degree and
49:02 because executives can have God
49:04 complexes from previous employment or
49:06 just these you know uppity Ivy League
49:09 folks it's not everywhere but there's
49:11 enough of it it's [ __ ] up Hollywood
49:13 we can't get a good movie out of any
49:15 studio and it's because at that level at
49:21 the tippy top level there are not
49:22 allowed anyone who knows what the [ __ ]
49:24 they're doing is not allowed to tell the
49:26 executive at the studio this script
49:28 sucks this movie sucks oh yeah your
49:32 special effects well of course you're
49:33 gonna be able to buy a bunch of
49:34 explosions right but this film sucks
49:38 don't make it yet we can make it great
49:41 we need to rewrite the script maybe 50
49:44 times whatever it takes but this totally
49:46 sucks don't greenlight this and then you
49:49 might find a script that's great that
49:51 takes a risk right and the studio's are
49:54 saying that they are they are keeping
49:56 Hollywood alive by not taking risks by
49:59 remaking every old movie right making a
50:03 sequel they're everything that's out
50:05 there right and they're playing games
50:08 with our loyalties right those of you
50:09 are Star Wars fans how much did you like
50:11 Star Wars awakening or Star Wars awakens
50:14 it was a [ __ ] film you know they played
50:19 the minority card right in front of your
50:20 [ __ ] face right the black guy was a
50:22 [ __ ] janitor
50:23 right he couldn't possibly be an
50:26 intelligent human being
50:27 the commander's responsibility with some
50:30 you know prestigious career equal to his
50:32 white counterparts on the movie he was a
50:34 janitor and that was a big joke that the
50:36 black guy was a janitor and not
50:39 unbelievable just went right under the
50:40 radar no one complained about it at all
50:42 well when jar-jar being sounded like a
50:44 [ __ ] everyone went [ __ ] crazy which
50:47 they should have you know those first
50:50 three Star Wars they remade in the 90s
50:52 you got racial racial stereotypes as
50:56 every single accent to an alien right
50:59 the little guy that flew around the
51:00 mechanic shop he was he was the Italian
51:03 oh he talk like this you know and then
51:04 it was the tall thin aliens at the end
51:07 hole all they would lock Asian people oh
51:09 yeah because that wasn't totally [ __ ]
51:11 offensive right whatever happened to
51:13 Star Wars invented languages this
51:16 sounded like [ __ ] aliens whatever
51:19 happened to that so let me continue with
51:22 analogy before I get all emotional about
51:24 that but the thing is is that Hollywood
51:25 can't make a great film on average now
51:28 there are ones that slipped through
51:29 obviously which we like but no one's
51:32 going to those movies anymore
51:34 the theaters have actually I think tanah
51:37 credible job upgrading the experience
51:39 where you have assigned seating you have
51:41 people to bring concession out to you
51:43 there's now people watching the
51:45 audience's throughout the production so
51:47 when you're sitting there sure
51:49 throughout the viewing process of
51:50 somebody's make a bunch of damn noise
51:51 they come up and tell them to shut the
51:53 hell up that's awesome
51:54 I've actually had some pretty good
51:55 experiences of last couple of years but
51:58 I can't find a reason to pay these
52:00 exorbitant prices you know fifty bucks
52:03 for two or three people to go to the
52:05 movie theater and the movie sucks and
52:07 you can't get your money back it's like
52:09 eating the whole meal and going most
52:10 really was bland well tough [ __ ] you ate
52:12 it all the reason why Hollywood's dying
52:17 is because of the emperor has no clothes
52:20 on algorithm people are so high and
52:23 mighty that you can tell them the truth
52:25 and they're just the kind of Schmucks
52:27 that don't want to be told the truth you
52:31 know there's always that if you have any
52:33 integrity in your life there's always
52:35 that moment when you meet someone within
52:36 your family within your circle of
52:39 friends that just simply can't hear
52:41 truth all right I got some friends that
52:45 are you know they've known each other
52:47 longer than I've known them and from
52:50 time to time one guy gets in the
52:52 [ __ ] right one guy did something
52:53 that puts them in the [ __ ] and you
52:56 know sometimes you can agree but
52:57 sometimes it's completely unfounded
52:59 and so I'm sitting in the room and
53:01 they're badmouth and the guy it's not in
53:02 the room and I happen to know the guy
53:06 that they're bad-mouthing I know all the
53:07 facts of what went on and when I try to
53:10 represent this guy because he's not
53:12 there don't do very often
53:16 the people that are wrong the people who
53:18 are lying okay
53:21 say well we just can't talk about this I
53:24 just can't talk about this is just I get
53:26 so emotional I just can't talk we just
53:28 shouldn't talk about this we're gonna
53:29 get a big argument if we talk about this
53:31 basically saying I'm gonna throw a
53:33 [ __ ] tantrum like a child if you so
53:36 much to start counteracting my [ __ ]
53:38 take on another human being my lies
53:40 about another human being which don't
53:45 make any logical sense it's it's like if
53:47 you do the logic loop of what they're
53:49 claiming the pieces and parts cannot fit
53:51 together so you know you've got a liar
53:54 in the room right but they bully you out
54:00 of debate now one of the distinctions
54:04 about the protests that are going on is
54:05 that I see videos like I did yesterday
54:07 and these kids are like 18 to 24
54:11 somewhere in there and so you know that
54:13 if you're an adult you know you know
54:14 jack-shit when you're that young I mean
54:16 you know [ __ ] nothing about the world
54:18 it doesn't mean you're a bad person it
54:20 just means you're not informed you
54:22 haven't lived enough life to research
54:25 this stuff in most cases for those that
54:28 are awake at that age man they are
54:29 gifted prodigy children they really are
54:32 we should celebrate their tenacity but
54:37 during the presidential election here in
54:39 America all last year and the beginning
54:42 of this year I had people in their 70s
54:46 every single age from 70 down to 20
54:51 caring utter propaganda
54:54 like boldface propaganda like ridiculous
54:58 cartoon versions of reality when
55:02 countered with facts and some of this is
55:06 not very acidic stuff someone's just the
55:08 most basic stuff how the world works who
55:11 runs this [ __ ] place right I would
55:15 get shut down by statements like well
55:16 none of that matters it was the most
55:20 common statement I heard none of that
55:21 met the facts don't matter I personally
55:25 don't like daddy that Trump is daddy
55:27 Trump walks in the room and says knock
55:29 that [ __ ] off would you what do you mean
55:32 we don't take care of our veterans you
55:35 mean to tell me you know the sales pitch
55:37 to get in the army is to serve your
55:38 country and have all this [ __ ] you
55:41 know patriotic thought process to go
55:43 kill people you have no [ __ ] idea who
55:44 they are
55:45 there's no difference between going to
55:47 the Middle East and killing people going
55:48 to Vietnam and killing people you don't
55:50 know we didn't know who those people
55:52 were in Vietnam they hadn't done
55:54 anything to us the Gulf of Tonkin you
55:56 know events were all fake and now we
55:59 orchestrate this 9/11 thing and run over
56:01 and kill a bunch of people over there
56:02 for business for the integrity of our US
56:05 dollar right and so let's say they buy
56:08 into all that patriotic pate right you
56:09 must sacrifice yourself for your country
56:11 and then these guys get messed up they
56:13 get PTSD they have actual physical
56:18 events that maim them that take away
56:20 their limbs that burn them or all the
56:22 above and they come back here they ask
56:28 for a socialistic form of help like help
56:32 me I just sacrifice my life my ability
56:36 to walk without crutches or a wheelchair
56:40 to you know people have been burned in
56:42 their face think about it man after they
56:45 heal they look in the mirror and the
56:48 person that they were their whole life
56:49 is gone
56:50 physically speaking right you know that
56:52 the the inside obviously there is still
56:54 the same person but they have to give up
56:56 the fact that they don't look like the
56:57 way they looked before is there anything
57:00 more [ __ ] horrific than that and
57:02 don't you think we could do something
57:04 good for those people so every kid out
57:07 there sanding some
57:08 can antifa line is basically telling
57:11 that soldier go [ __ ] yourself you were
57:15 stupid for getting into war so [ __ ] you
57:18 stay maimed suffer you know what and
57:22 faster you can kill yourself the better
57:25 because not taking care of a PTSD
57:28 soldier is basically rolling you know
57:32 playing Russian roulette with their
57:34 ability to stay alive and a lot of these
57:36 men and women are married they have
57:38 children they have responsibilities but
57:40 you know what above all they have the
57:41 right to be under common law and have no
57:44 harm done to them obviously the war drew
57:49 them into some horrible things sometimes
57:51 but sometimes the soldier doesn't kill
57:52 anybody they're just there and they get
57:54 hurt so here comes a responsible adult
57:58 for the first time and God knows how
58:01 many hundreds of years since this
58:03 country has put together they take care
58:05 or he takes care with people who are
58:07 devoting their entire lives to this they
58:10 take care of these soldiers but he's an
58:13 [ __ ] right there's a ton of this
58:16 going on I now know why the social
58:21 justice warriors don't want Obamacare to
58:23 go away because they're all gonna die
58:25 cancer all of them every [ __ ] one of
58:29 them is gonna die a cancer if they don't
58:30 pull their head of their ass because
58:32 they're living in these giant hate
58:33 bubbles and hate breeds cancer so of
58:38 course they're gonna need socialistic
58:40 health care but cancer is the one thing
58:43 that's incredibly expensive that health
58:47 insurance companies do not want to
58:49 insure I was involved in a software
58:53 company in the Bay Area we have 75
58:54 employees here in America was actually a
58:56 British Lee British founded company and
58:59 in the first two and a half years I
59:01 worked for them we went through probably
59:03 three or four different health policies
59:05 and every time you had a company and
59:06 they change health policies you get the
59:08 big giant booklet of where you find your
59:10 doctor how to do all this stuff and they
59:11 kept just giving us to us and give us I
59:13 was like Jesus what's going on you know
59:16 and they said well here's the problem
59:17 the senior VP of Sales was a female had
59:21 a husband that was
59:22 cancer and the insurance policies kept
59:25 canceling our entire company policy
59:30 due to this guy's bills when I guarantee
59:34 you 75 people because it was her
59:37 external husband it wasn't part of the
59:39 count all of our premiums would have
59:42 easily paid for everyone's a little tiny
59:44 you know antibiotic visit but also would
59:46 have paid that guy's monthly premium in
59:48 a heartbeat they weren't losing any
59:49 money they were making money off our
59:51 company but it just fell below the
59:52 margin or they didn't want to get him
59:55 all the way to his death because maybe
59:57 they thought his bills were gonna you
59:58 know accelerate and go up in price but
60:03 we went through at least three policies
60:04 and finally she was told you you cannot
60:09 bring your husband on this insurance
60:10 policy you can have yourself and your
60:12 kids but you can't bring your husband on
60:13 and those companies wrote Obamacare but
60:21 if you try to acknowledge reality well
60:25 then you're a bad person right there are
60:29 organizations out there which make all
60:31 their money by being scumbags right
60:33 tabloids tabloids are funded and allowed
60:39 to do what they do by the government's
60:41 that should shut them down for harassing
60:44 human beings but they're allowed to
60:46 exist because they are to keep the
60:47 control on the talent that gets wealthy
60:51 now again there's no reason why you
60:53 should listen to an actor tell you how
60:55 to vote you shouldn't listen to just you
60:58 know musicians and famous people simply
61:00 because there's someone that you you
61:02 enjoy their byproduct of what they do
61:04 right
61:06 you should make decisions for yourself I
61:09 was watching this little documentary on
61:13 George Michael I think I mentioned doing
61:15 this and a previous episode I haven't
61:16 aired yet and it was the whole scandal
61:20 of him being at the Beverly Hills Hotel
61:25 getting you know going down to this park
61:27 being in some you know rest you know
61:30 some public bathroom I mean he gets
61:32 busted by a cop
61:34 for trying to do something installs and
61:37 you know the cops solicited sex he
61:40 agreed and then he gets busted it was
61:41 toll entrapment and the tabloid ran a
61:44 headline that said zip me up before you
61:46 go-go exposing for the very first time
61:49 but a lot of people suspect it was that
61:52 George Michael was a homosexual and then
61:55 in the interview they're interviewing
61:57 the chief editor of whichever tabla I
62:00 think it was The Enquirer or something
62:02 like that that wrote that headline and
62:04 this guy was utterly shameless right he
62:12 could care less about the utter chaos
62:15 and destruction he did to George
62:17 Michaels career his public image pulling
62:21 out a personal thing now of course
62:22 there's all kinds of legal stipulations
62:24 that someone could debate to say that
62:26 once you do something in public and you
62:27 get busted by the cops it's a matter of
62:28 public record true right but when Prince
62:33 the musician had a child with my T the
62:39 child lived about forty days or so and
62:41 passed away and once the child passes
62:43 away that becomes a matter of public
62:45 record you can't hide the fact that his
62:47 son Prince Rogers Nelson and I forgot
62:52 his wife's real name maite whenever this
62:56 child dies it becomes a matter of public
62:58 record now a lot of people have no idea
63:01 that he had a child and that it died of
63:04 a horrible dis condition where it never
63:08 developed cartilage in its body so the
63:10 entire bone structure of the child was
63:12 fused but the Enquirer left him alone
63:16 the son left him alone all of these
63:19 tabloid agencies left him alone and it
63:22 happened while the internet existed you
63:24 know it was fairly early in the
63:25 internet's history but they left him
63:28 alone because there was certain level of
63:30 dignity and respect they had for prince
63:34 but you know and it's a child it's it's
63:37 obviously a much innocent it's it's a
63:39 horrible tragedy due to just some
63:42 anomalies that occurred in George
63:43 Michael's out there being the bad
63:45 homosexual
63:47 right so he deserves to be dragged up
63:49 and down the thoroughfare with The
63:53 Scarlet Letter around his neck right
63:55 those organizations still exist the
64:00 organizations that have I guess you
64:02 could say gay shamed still exist but now
64:08 they flip the script because they are
64:10 used as tools to carve up the minds of
64:12 anyone who's gullible enough to read
64:14 them and there's all this social
64:19 pressure from all different areas to to
64:22 essentially be penalized if you were to
64:25 acknowledge reality in any way shape or
64:27 form respectfully acknowledge it or be a
64:31 jerk about it
64:33 jerks always make themselves isolated in
64:36 this world they do and you don't have to
64:39 say a damn thing you know for everyone
64:42 who's concerned about Donald Trump being
64:44 you know very boisterous and in their
64:47 brains that he doesn't act like a
64:48 president because he's not getting Nobel
64:51 Peace Prizes for doing [ __ ] nothing
64:53 he doesn't lie about science related to
64:56 climate change whatever if you think
65:00 he's that bad and you're so certain he's
65:02 that bad let him hang himself the best
65:06 that you can ever do with anyone who's
65:08 acting like a dick in your life or or
65:10 perhaps maybe engaging in sort of the
65:13 precursor to trying to to betray you is
65:18 to acknowledge what they might be doing
65:20 and give them as much rope as possible
65:23 because it is best that you get out of
65:26 that mechanism of their influence on
65:29 your life as quickly as possible before
65:30 they destroy you you know what I'm in
65:34 business deals with folks and anyone
65:37 starts acting what I think might be a
65:39 little nefarious I think they're gonna
65:41 start asking for a disproportional
65:43 amount of the shares of not necessarily
65:45 stock shares but just a share of the
65:48 money or whatever I can instead of
65:51 fighting them you know I might make a
65:53 few clarifying statements to them and
65:55 kind of make sure that we're all in the
65:57 same page of what they're asking
65:59 and then I just give them as much rope
66:03 as possible until they utterly choke on
66:07 the [ __ ] and until what they're trying
66:09 to hide becomes utterly and completely
66:11 exposed in front of everybody and then
66:16 they learn a big lesson usually right
66:19 now it's your option at the end of that
66:21 exercise to give them a big hug and say
66:24 okay you know that was your old way of
66:27 doing it now once you try my way my way
66:30 is we divvy this [ __ ] up evenly we keep
66:33 it all aboveboard and you know half the
66:37 time I can usually get someone to
66:40 understand that it was just a previous
66:43 thought process that they had that was a
66:45 little too greedy that put them in this
66:48 oh this is my chance to really take it
66:51 all take everyone else's money take
66:53 everyone else's credit for something but
66:57 people who are jerks always isolate
66:59 themselves always it's it's almost as if
67:03 your attitude towards others is a
67:05 chromatic frequency of existence let me
67:10 throw something at you at the same time
67:11 we're on that subject for those of you
67:14 who are like me and you considered
67:16 yourself you know the classification of
67:20 the I should say you don't really
67:21 consider yourself but the classification
67:23 you got in school was a mutt I never
67:28 spent I mean it was like the terms the
67:30 last part of my high school years I was
67:32 there long enough that people said oh
67:34 he's a familiar face and you know he's
67:36 cool and we do these things with him and
67:38 he's always got something trick up his
67:40 sleeve something he's surprising us with
67:42 that we like and so I did well probably
67:44 last two years of my high school life
67:46 but up until that point you know if I
67:49 moved to Massachusetts I wasn't Jewish
67:51 or Irish so I was this weird racial mud
67:54 like who the [ __ ] are you you're not one
67:56 of us and some people warm up to me for
67:58 a little while and then D warm up or
68:00 whatever walk away it was weird as
68:02 people had integrity the entire time but
68:04 I remember I had a couple black friends
68:09 in Massachusetts and we kind of stuck
68:12 together because we're like look at
68:15 these people they're fighting constantly
68:17 the Jews and the Irish are pounding each
68:19 other in the face every day after school
68:20 and we'd have to get involved just to
68:23 get home you know it's crazy but we were
68:25 kind of in this mutt world right what I
68:29 want to mention about this mud thing is
68:30 that if you've been involved with that
68:32 or if you've grown up out of whatever
68:34 clique you were in and you don't
68:35 consider yourself a mutt but you know
68:37 those folks as the years go by
68:41 especially if you go to your high school
68:44 reunions or at least use Facebook to
68:46 maintain connections with folks you'll
68:48 understand that the folks that were
68:51 ostracized at times turned out to be
68:54 some of the coolest people you've ever
68:55 met in your life and a lot of times the
68:57 most successful people out of the entire
68:59 school system and you start to rethink
69:02 what we were as children was not healthy
69:06 it wasn't based on facts it was based on
69:09 emotions it was based on exclusivity and
69:12 tribalism for everyone who wants the
69:15 world to be a utopia which quite frankly
69:18 I think most people do besides maybe
69:21 Luciferian people that are looking to
69:22 make the world burn like George Soros
69:25 it's funny that that if you if an antiva
69:28 person understood what George is trying
69:30 to do to the world they would realize
69:32 that they're being manipulated by the
69:33 wizard from hell it's really interesting
69:36 but but knowing people that are older
69:39 who act like these children it's a real
69:45 confusing situation where you say to
69:47 yourself how did you get so old and
69:51 remain so stupid and it's beyond
69:55 ignorant right when you reach a certain
69:57 age I mean honestly speaking if you get
70:00 to 40 years old and you're still hanging
70:02 on to Dogma be the label of oh we feel
70:05 sorry for you because you're ignorant
70:07 no one's ever taught you what's right
70:08 becomes stupidity very quickly you are
70:12 now choosing to remain uninformed
70:14 because you're weak it's really usually
70:17 what it
70:18 turns comes down to is your week you're
70:21 lazy but let me give you a caveat to
70:25 that to be slightly more understanding
70:29 of some folks I am now completely
70:33 certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that
70:36 there is an age it's different for every
70:38 single person okay there is an age where
70:41 depending on how you toxify yourself and
70:44 I've got friends that are in their 80s
70:47 who are completely lucid and just sharp
70:51 as a nail totally awake and I mean
70:54 everything we talked about on this show
70:56 and all those conspiracies they know it
70:58 they they have researched it and they
71:00 believe it and they don't believe the
71:02 [ __ ] they believe the real stuff and
71:04 they where they don't know they say they
71:06 don't know so they're just like us and
71:08 they're 80s but I know people that are
71:10 younger than that that are over 60 they
71:14 are starting to forget what they have
71:17 learned in their life and so they begin
71:20 struggling with life and we're to have
71:22 pity on this situation we're to be
71:25 empathetic to their biological
71:27 regression because it happens it's
71:31 probably due to alcoholism might be due
71:33 to drugs might be due to just simply
71:35 getting old but another thing occurs one
71:40 they're forgetting what they learned so
71:42 something that they were good at they
71:43 have to struggle to remember how to do
71:45 it it's like one of those things where
71:48 you're it's what they say it's just like
71:50 riding a bike you get back on the bike
71:51 and you know how to do it I haven't
71:52 ridden a bicycle I don't even know how
71:55 many years it's been decades but I
71:57 guarantee if I get on one I'm gonna be
71:58 able to write it but the second thing
72:02 that happens with age is that you can no
72:07 longer knit learn new things and this is
72:11 probably I don't know within five years
72:13 of exiting the world to be honest now
72:19 there's also obviously we know health
72:20 issues that occur bones and joints start
72:23 to ache
72:23 that's pretty black and white right
72:26 your knee starts hurting or your hip
72:28 starts hurting or something well that's
72:29 just black and white that's just you got
72:32 to take care of that [ __ ] right
72:33 luckily modern medicine fixes those
72:35 things very quickly but there comes a
72:38 point where you can no longer and learn
72:39 new things you might learn it for a
72:43 really short period of time and keep it
72:44 in your head but if you go to bed you
72:46 know your computer reboots when you go
72:48 to bed whatever was in your
72:49 consciousness is going away for the
72:51 evening when you wake up you're
72:53 disoriented and you get reoriented and
72:55 you kind of get your bearings to go oh
72:56 yeah yeah I got to go that meeting I'm
72:58 [ __ ] what am I gonna talk about oh that
72:59 thing right there's a point where you
73:01 lose the ability to do that I mentioned
73:05 that to you because a lot of times as a
73:08 young person you confide in folks that
73:14 are older and you try to seek wisdom
73:17 from older folks in most cases I think
73:21 that works beautifully unfortunately I
73:24 think that the youth of this world you
73:26 know well put this way my age late 40s
73:29 you have my grandparents knew [ __ ] they
73:33 went through the depression at least one
73:35 side of them did when I asked them I
73:38 asked my grandmother at least from that
73:39 era you know what's life about etc etc
73:43 her answers were always extremely simple
73:47 and beautiful and to the heart of
73:49 humanity if you're in your 20s you're
73:56 dealing with me as your parents if you
73:59 in your 30s you kind of have a younger
74:01 sort of baby boomer parent I have baby
74:04 boomer boomer parents right and they
74:08 were the first group to unfortunately
74:10 get indoctrinated to get had you know
74:13 allies people still think Lee Harvey
74:15 Oswald shot JFK they still think credit
74:17 cards are real money or fake money right
74:20 fake money you don't have to pay back
74:22 some of them are strung out on buying
74:25 new [ __ ] all the time and they don't
74:27 need anything just because life is
74:30 boring you know they don't have a trade
74:33 skill they don't do anything they don't
74:34 create anything they're just sitting in
74:36 the audience waiting for the next
74:38 television show to come
74:39 right I mentioned this because this is
74:44 the fabric of which this is just a tiny
74:46 glimpse into the fabric of what we're
74:48 dealing with
74:49 when we try to make society kind of a
74:51 homogenous single frequency it's gonna
74:56 take a long long time to do this right
75:00 no one ever imagined I don't think 15
75:04 years ago that there'd be a billionaire
75:05 out there who lies about his wealth who
75:09 was going to be funding the sort of
75:11 social destruction of the mind for
75:14 various regions of the world creating
75:17 chaos trying to get the United States of
75:19 America into a revolution which will
75:21 then you know provide the excuse to
75:24 crash the economy there's no reason why
75:28 America should should encounter any
75:30 major financial catastrophe even if Los
75:34 Angeles was liquefied with an earthquake
75:36 that shouldn't affect the rest of the 50
75:39 states big hurricane could destroy a big
75:43 part of the coast we should still be
75:45 able to hang on to our financial
75:48 sovereignty right Europe can get into a
75:52 gigantic war with all these terrorist
75:56 cells that aren't help moving in on a
75:57 daily basis and we should still be okay
75:59 over here
76:01 but only if we get our [ __ ] together and
76:04 become more strategically
76:05 self-sufficient so in closing let's talk
76:09 about one sort of course of action
76:13 because the big question is you in a
76:16 typical presentation where you're
76:19 pitching something and I'm really not
76:20 trying to pitch anything but let's wake
76:22 the hell up here I'm trying to pitch a
76:24 different perspective the question is
76:28 when you see people get violence from a
76:30 very small sect of ignorant human beings
76:34 that are terrified of life and therefore
76:36 scapegoating anything they possibly can
76:40 to say this is why I don't have a job
76:42 it's not because I don't have any
76:44 education or
76:45 willpower it's because there's a man I
76:47 don't like in office right crowded
76:50 probably the most scientifically
76:52 pathetic [ __ ] mindset you could
76:55 possibly ever have right wishing that
76:58 the world would crash and burn so at
77:00 least everyone else is suffering like
77:02 you like the old low guns in the
77:04 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy just
77:07 had an unhappy love affair and I don't
77:08 see why anyone else should have a good
77:09 time
77:10 what they're trying to incite is
77:12 violence death they want people in the
77:19 United States or I should say George
77:21 Soros wants people to die in America by
77:24 the millions and millions and millions
77:27 the higher the number the more happy
77:29 that guy will be the more that it
77:32 affects our economy since he has put a
77:35 put option on all the stocks of any
77:37 significance in America and all the
77:39 stocks of any significance in Europe if
77:42 Europe goes into a gigantic war was the
77:45 Muslim invasion that he is paying for
77:47 and if we can just get you know the
77:50 antifa against the Republicans or
77:52 whatever which is the you know the
77:53 facade the fake war that's being
77:56 incubated here he'll love it the devil
78:01 wins to put it one way or another one of
78:05 the Magic Bullet sayings that came out
78:06 of doing MKULTRA radio in this show was
78:09 saying I came up with witches research
78:11 nothing know everything that is your
78:15 average protester today and quite
78:17 frankly it's been the protest that I've
78:18 ever seen my entire lifetime I think way
78:21 back in season one I talked about a
78:23 protest I saw on television against
78:26 nuclear power and there was a little kid
78:29 with his crunchy old dad just looked
78:33 like his [ __ ] grandfather out there
78:35 and he was protesting against nuclear
78:37 power in the end obviously the guy from
78:40 the news station just walked up to the
78:41 kid and said what are you doing here
78:43 Darmok took the power I like turtles and
78:47 oh gosh maybe I was intelligent shaming
78:52 there
78:54 they said well just tell me why is
78:56 nuclear power bad get it nothing nothing
79:02 but he's holding the sign out there
79:03 right manipulated by his old man
79:05 and I'm not saying nuclear power is the
79:08 way to go right but you can't I think
79:15 protest effectively if you don't have
79:17 your facts straight and that's the name
79:21 of the game in America now there's also
79:24 false flags that go on constantly it's a
79:28 lot of evidence that Charlottesville had
79:29 a lot of shenanigans going on with the
79:31 cops being told to leave
79:34 you know pigeonholing the protest group
79:37 and by the way the protest was the right
79:40 wing or I should say right wing the the
79:43 entire protest was and the petition and
79:47 the filing with the city to have the
79:50 protest was a former Obama t'v Obama
79:52 executive and former CNN employee who's
79:55 known as a leftist filed the permit so
79:59 that these KKK guys or whatever could do
80:01 that whole thing in Charlottesville and
80:05 that amazing and they made him go down a
80:07 street that's a one-way street so they
80:08 they had half the protesters that showed
80:11 up to do their little you know protest
80:13 of taking down the statue saying don't
80:15 do it they're cornered in this
80:17 cul-de-sac at the end of the road and
80:19 then they let these violent and T foot
80:21 people come in you know with with you
80:23 know baseball bats with spikes on the
80:25 end because they saw walking dead and
80:26 think that's [ __ ] cool bricks all
80:30 knocked into pieces inside bedsheets I
80:33 mean they were ready to to get into a
80:36 physical fight but the left organized
80:40 both sides of this game
80:41 half the people arrived then the antifa
80:44 people arrived and as soon as the antifa
80:46 came in on that group of folks and they
80:49 knew it was a one-way street the cops
80:51 left because they were supposed to leave
80:53 to make sure that violence ensued and
80:55 then this guy comes out of [ __ ]
80:56 nowhere in some car with a blacked-out
80:58 windshield
80:59 no one ever filmed the guy they caught
81:01 in that car they just caught him later
81:03 off-camera you know every single cop car
81:05 has a camera in the front
81:06 I haven't seen that footage the one way
81:11 that you can make this thing end is to
81:13 make sure that if you are part of the
81:15 other group of people that aren't these
81:18 antifa folks
81:19 social justice warrior folks if you're
81:22 not part of that group let's say you're
81:24 a white supremacist let's just say which
81:27 coming from the Midwest is a dying
81:30 there's a dying group of people man that
81:32 has been dying off since I was a little
81:34 kid man don't protest anything stay out
81:40 of it let them show up by themselves
81:43 right your protest to keep a statue up
81:46 isn't gonna change [ __ ] you know act
81:48 outside of a protest because if you show
81:53 up and in fact if you say I'm we're
81:55 never going to show up and people show
81:57 up then we know that someone's acting
82:00 both sides of the fence Russell Brand
82:03 who's a super intelligent guy but I
82:06 think he's easily the problem with him
82:09 and I don't know him personally anything
82:11 but I just think he's too impressionable
82:12 but he said something very intelligent
82:15 in his book about revolution or whatever
82:17 it was but he didn't think protesting
82:21 really helped until he doesn't think it
82:22 works and I think he was completely
82:24 correct the world has changed the
82:26 internet makes physical protesting a
82:28 useless gesture so let's let them take
82:33 their days off work let's let them burn
82:36 up their vacations so that we don't have
82:38 to [ __ ] see him when we're in Hawaii
82:39 because they don't have any vacation
82:41 they can barely pay their rent because
82:43 they're out protesting just let them
82:45 burn up all their cash getting twenty
82:47 five bucks a day to go protest because
82:49 they answered a moveon.org
82:51 Craigslist ad to go protest let him do
82:54 it but just don't show up don't show up
82:57 to counteract them if you're a trump
82:59 supporter don't show up if you're an
83:01 anti you say you hate Trump but you
83:04 don't like something else they're
83:06 protesting about don't show up let them
83:09 be the only people who show up now for
83:12 those of you follow Milo you'll
83:14 understand that that's not that easy the
83:16 Berkeley thing was just Marlow coming to
83:17 speak and people trying to come and
83:19 listen to them and they
83:20 basically beat up their own facility you
83:22 know again they're tough guys with masks
83:24 on their faces right it's a little more
83:29 complicated than that but we can take a
83:30 big chunk of their entire thing and just
83:34 diffuse it now my smoke lounge we have
83:39 the sort of consciousness that comes on
83:41 and it's really interesting when the
83:43 random guys walk in the door and
83:44 discover the place they're little
83:47 cautious because sometimes we're playing
83:49 things on the TV that are analyzing what
83:52 I'm talking about on this show it's how
83:54 we see a lot of material that I talk
83:55 about on the show and they're nervous
83:58 they're nervous about acknowledging that
84:03 the emperor has no clothes on because
84:04 they have been surrounded in on TV okay
84:07 with people who think that he does
84:10 people who are in self-denial people are
84:14 double speaking themselves and I'll tell
84:17 you you should see their face once they
84:18 realize they're in a room full of people
84:20 that have their heads and their asses
84:22 and no one in the room is extreme right
84:25 no one definitely is extreme left we're
84:27 sort of right in the middle we just want
84:29 a beautiful world for everyone and these
84:33 guys start talking and you could see
84:36 that they have been hurting and that
84:38 they've been locked in a cage because
84:39 they've allowed the pressures of media
84:41 to make a feel like that they're the
84:43 only person in the goddamn world that
84:45 thinks for Humanity they're not racists
84:49 right and the fun thing is is that we
84:52 have all races in our in our lounge and
84:59 so we get to ask questions you know well
85:00 what a Chinese people think of this what
85:02 do Indian people think of this what do
85:04 Arabs think of this they're all there in
85:06 our place it's just some beautiful lucid
85:10 conversations going on and that's what
85:12 I'm trying to stimulate on this show so
85:15 I hope you feel me on this one obviously
85:17 this is very controversial I typically
85:19 try to lean away from this kind of stuff
85:21 one because I get emotional as you can
85:23 tell I've said this a couple times on
85:26 different episodes from Season one all
85:27 the way up but I want to reiterate right
85:29 now so that we can take away something
85:31 very positive from this Congress
85:34 99.9% carry the nine quite a few decimal
85:38 places of humanity is peaceful calm
85:44 wants no trouble with another human
85:46 being has no aggressive gene to commit
85:51 genocide to really exploit their own
85:55 perception of the haves and have-nots
85:56 but the media creates narratives out of
86:02 thin air you know remember the Russian
86:06 collusion thing they do it to sell ads
86:09 to make money they're profiting off of
86:12 the undermining of humanity at times
86:17 they will have victories and they
86:19 convince a bunch of college students to
86:21 join these groups and be militant to
86:24 destroy other people's lives I will say
86:27 for those of you well no I don't think
86:30 anyone's doing this [ __ ] watching this
86:32 show if you've ever done it or you've
86:34 ever seen it done and you've been
86:35 victimized by it I'll say this much the
86:38 older that you get the more you
86:39 understand karma and I will say to the
86:43 degree you hurt another human being in
86:45 this world you've got some [ __ ] coming
86:48 your way baby and it's it's probably
86:53 only diffused out of your impending
86:57 [ __ ] doom if you can make penance and
87:01 apologize and fix what you broke and I
87:05 actually think you have to fix it more
87:07 than you broke it because let's say this
87:08 listener virus that got fired let's say
87:11 that some of the people in that group
87:12 felt bad after a while and they went and
87:15 got him the job again they got to do
87:17 more than just that did not suffer the
87:21 slings and arrows of karma karma is
87:24 unforgiving karma is a constant of the
87:28 universe but let me tell you the little
87:29 trick but I've told a couple times on
87:31 the show so you understand it for those
87:35 of you are suffering because of someone
87:36 else's deeds against you and you know
87:38 that you were well within your rights to
87:41 do what you did you weren't hurting
87:42 anyone else you were just strictly the
87:44 victim of something else
87:46 the Karma comes for those who did it but
87:50 the catch is the following it doesn't
87:52 happen when you want it to happen and it
87:54 doesn't happen often the way that you
87:56 would like it to happen to them for
87:58 those of you who have been victimized by
88:00 folks that you have no knowledge of you
88:02 don't know who they are they've they're
88:04 cowards Karma's coming for them and
88:12 karma is is more strategic and more
88:15 thorough than anything that you and I
88:17 could ever conceive in our own
88:20 reactionary mode you know like when
88:22 you're hurt by someone you dream up a
88:27 bunch of ways to get back at people and
88:29 you may dream up some extreme [ __ ] in
88:32 your brain right and then you'll calm
88:33 down you'll say I don't want that
88:35 negativity in my system the beautiful
88:38 thing is is that as long as you can
88:39 survive and walk away karma takes care
88:43 of everything it does I think it is a
88:47 principle of the universe because of the
88:51 law of attraction the law of attraction
88:53 is the single one policing force of
88:55 common law and you do harm to someone
88:59 else either to get ahead or just to be a
89:02 dick or because you lost your [ __ ]
89:04 mind for a little while you have sent
89:10 the beacon out to the universe that
89:14 destruction is what you're interested in
89:17 evil is what you were loyal to and it's
89:21 coming for you baby it's coming so think
89:26 real hard about how much you need to
89:29 personally punish other people for what
89:31 they've done and for those who've been
89:33 victims a couple things one lay back in
89:38 your bed tonight
89:39 take a big giant beautiful breath and
89:42 exhale and let the grin just climb on
89:46 your face because you don't need to know
89:49 who these people were
89:50 they have one curse
89:54 okay that is on upon them that cannot be
89:58 removed which is it's a two factor fold
90:01 one they get to wake up being who they
90:05 are every single day and nothing changes
90:08 that but them so an [ __ ] wakes up an
90:12 [ __ ] every single day no matter how
90:14 much they can reach out and touch you
90:16 and hurt you you get to wake up a
90:18 righteous person they have to wake up an
90:21 [ __ ] and the other thing is is
90:24 they've been stamped by karma there's an
90:26 identity little barcode on them and
90:30 Karma's comin right
90:32 it's just swimming like a serpent
90:33 through the universe and it will strike
90:35 them and it will correct them and you
90:40 might think that you know people like
90:41 Jimmy Savile you know is a child
90:44 trafficker for the royalty of Britain
90:47 and all the parliament and all these
90:48 people he delivered children to these
90:49 people and he dies without being person
90:51 prosecuted right alright so maybe in a
90:55 really extreme case someone gets to exit
90:57 this world without getting what you
91:00 would call Karma but I think we've had
91:03 enough near-death experiences by people
91:06 to understand that there is quite a
91:08 lucid world on the other side of this
91:10 life that our transcended form isn't
91:13 necessarily wiped clean of its
91:15 responsibilities who knows what happens
91:17 forget fire and brimstone and hell and
91:19 all that [ __ ] but it's the
91:21 equivalent it's the equivalent does that
91:26 mean we let you know people go without
91:29 any persecution we don't put people in
91:31 jail we don't take out pedophiles
91:34 absolutely not we have to manage this
91:36 world as well we are responsible for
91:39 this world and I think for the very
91:40 first time in a couple centuries we've
91:43 now changed our mind about letting
91:46 everything happen to us incidentally and
91:49 leza farewell you know Jesus the world
91:52 sucks and then you die I think we're
91:54 done with that little saying the little
91:56 catchphrase I think we're willing to
91:59 take responsibility for what's going on
92:01 it's a slow crawl at first right when
92:04 there's a paradigm shift in society we
92:06 take a long time
92:07 to harmonize into the masses there's a
92:13 lot of problems that we don't have
92:14 solutions for racism is sort of this you
92:19 know this cheap label on what really
92:21 amounts to cultural differences a
92:24 person's skin color doesn't mean
92:27 anything really just a color culturally
92:32 if a group of people have a methodology
92:35 of living that another culture refuses
92:38 to accept such as children being wives
92:41 of old men most of society frowns on
92:46 that but there's a giant portion of the
92:49 world thinks that that's okay and what's
92:52 weird about it of course and the
92:53 doublespeak
92:54 world that we live in you have laws in
92:57 Europe that say you can't do that it's
93:00 considered statutory rape America has
93:02 the same exact thing I think most modern
93:04 first rule countries have statutory rape
93:06 limits and I'll let have sex with people
93:09 under a certain age you know if you're
93:11 in America if you're 17 and under
93:13 probably I don't know 15 to 17 you guys
93:17 can start having sex in this country and
93:19 the laws not going to step in
93:21 necessarily second you cross 18 and you
93:24 have sex with that 16 year old you're a
93:25 rapist doesn't matter if she gives you
93:27 consent or not I think there's some
93:29 states in America that loosen up around
93:31 16 but over the years that that age is
93:34 risen and risen right up to 18 but we're
93:40 supposed to be bringing people into
93:41 these first world countries that believe
93:44 completely the opposite an 80 year old
93:47 man can have sex with a seven-year-old
93:48 girl so that's the case proved out in
93:50 Germany
93:51 well Germany has statutory rape laws as
93:54 well for whatever reason they're now
93:56 softening pedophilia human trafficking
94:01 sex slavery to feel intellectual I don't
94:08 know a more unequivocal definition of
94:10 complete [ __ ] ignorance and stupidity
94:12 than that and yet that's sort of what
94:17 the 21st century's turned into currently
94:20 for those of you are Europeans you feel
94:23 like I'm preaching to the choir and
94:25 you've got a lot of conversations to
94:27 have and your fellow Europeans to make
94:29 sure that you just compare those two
94:30 things so look don't we think that
94:33 having sex with children is bad
94:35 yes oh yes yeah we okay
94:40 then why are we allowing this group of
94:43 people to come in or bringing their
94:45 child brides in how can it suddenly
94:48 become legal just because there's a
94:50 cultural you know norm that's being
94:52 imported into our country see how that
94:55 goes see how that goes because that
94:59 little girl is a human being that little
95:02 girl has inherited regardless of what
95:04 [ __ ] up culture man has created in one
95:07 sector of society she has the
95:10 inalienable right to not be harmed by
95:12 another human being next time you're out
95:14 in public do me this little piece of
95:16 homework favor for yourself next time
95:19 you see a bunch of little kids at a
95:21 restaurant and you see a little girl
95:24 that's around six seven years old with
95:27 their tiny little petite bodies I want
95:30 you to search in the room for the
95:31 biggest guy in that room especially if
95:33 you're in public some big six-foot-five
95:36 burly [ __ ] don't blame this guy
95:40 you're just picking out his physique
95:41 right but now imagine someone like that
95:45 mounting this child just we don't need
95:48 to go any further than that right but
95:51 that's what the European Union is
95:55 institutionalizing in a legal way right
95:58 now and 2017 you want to tell me that
96:02 that organization should exist I will
96:05 beg to differ
96:06 all right they know they can't pull that
96:09 [ __ ] in America they know they won't we
96:12 own a [ __ ] load of guns and we're and we
96:14 are part of the slice of humanity that
96:17 still eats meat still has aggression
96:21 against evil my European brothers and
96:25 sisters don't lose your humanity to the
96:29 Prussian education system
96:32 don't let this stuff grow because any of
96:37 you have ever had offspring and they're
96:39 still alive and they're gonna have
96:41 offspring
96:42 well did you want to take care of your
96:44 grandkids when they're happy but you
96:47 want to take care of your grandkids
96:48 because the German police said it was
96:50 okay that the guy from the sanctuary
96:52 city abducted your child maybe even
96:56 brainwashed her I think that she's part
96:58 of something because she doesn't like to
96:59 go to bed at 8 o'clock at night but
97:03 she's a sex slave somewhere in some tent
97:05 or some [ __ ] $5,000,000 penthouse
97:08 that handed out to these people your
97:11 world is your world and their world is
97:12 their world now if you want to be
97:16 intellectual and say well people are
97:18 different okay fine you do it in your
97:19 country but in this country it ain't
97:22 happening all right all right I think
97:25 that's it I won't make these very often
97:28 but this is something that just boiled
97:32 up you know bold up in me prior to
97:34 hearing about our listener being
97:35 attacked by these individuals we need to
97:39 protect each other from this lunacy for
97:43 any of you who have the time and the due
97:45 diligence to help defend people who have
97:48 been victims of this stuff please step
97:50 up to the plate if you're an attorney or
97:54 you're married to one or you know one
97:55 and you know that they're not down with
97:57 this then please inspire them to do some
98:01 pro bono defense work for people that
98:04 are victimized by this kind of stuff if
98:06 you're in press right about this kind of
