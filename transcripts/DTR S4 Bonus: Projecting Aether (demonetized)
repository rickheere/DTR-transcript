00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:33 deep thoughts for another bonus episode
00:37 this summer I think that's what I'm
00:38 gonna do is instead of just leaving you
00:40 guys high end I'll throw out a couple
00:42 episodes during the the off era so
00:46 you're not completely dead
00:48 it'll just won't be four to ten episodes
00:51 a month like I usually do and I hope to
00:57 let's try to build the reputation that
00:59 the summer episodes are actually a
01:01 little more far out but hopefully
01:05 rewarding so my last episode the bonus
01:10 one was about you know my journey to
01:12 ether how I discovered it rediscovered
01:16 you know the old research and my path
01:20 through it right this one's gonna be
01:24 about projecting ether because this
01:26 comes up all the time and conversation
01:28 but no one knows what they're talking
01:29 about meaning they're saying exactly
01:34 what happens but they don't know why
01:36 it's happening and I'm looking at this
01:38 whole universe in a different way and so
01:43 by the way it's fourth of July so if we
01:45 have any bombs going off in this guy
01:47 it's why the it is fairly well accepted
01:50 now in the community of the world that
01:52 we know when someone is staring at us
01:57 some of you in the comments have been
01:59 very astute and said but dude you know
02:03 we affect things with our consciousness
02:06 now there is going to be a spiritual
02:10 layer of that which I also believe in
02:12 which we're going to touch on but the
02:15 money the main thing I want you to
02:16 understand is there's a physical very
02:20 explainable thing and it changes the
02:24 entire world and I mean it really does
02:28 and it will change your perception the
02:30 more you get what I'm saying which you
02:31 will you will no longer walk in public
02:36 the same you won't be at a mall at a
02:39 concert
02:40 we'll hang with your family you won't be
02:41 with your lover your friend the same and
02:46 you'll start to have a little grin on
02:48 one side of your face like the Mona Lisa
02:50 if you stare in your eyes and you will
02:55 know that you now have a little secret
02:58 about how the universe works but what's
03:00 interesting is it's so massive in its
03:03 implication that it's going to literally
03:07 change everything for you okay what am I
03:12 talking about here I think I'm gonna
03:14 call the episode projecting ether why do
03:18 we sense that someone is staring at us
03:22 it's almost a phenomenon if you leave it
03:24 to you no formal science or bought off
03:28 Chile organisations like Wikipedia at
03:32 least before they declared their
03:34 independence from big giant corporations
03:38 controlling about information okay now
03:43 I'm telling you in episode after episode
03:45 for season four that you are made of
03:48 ether now I'm not saying your soul is
03:51 made of ether your soul probably rides
03:52 on top of that or maybe ether rides on
03:55 top of your soul who knows but ether is
03:57 everywhere and I don't think we are
03:58 everywhere
03:59 I don't think at this point in my life
04:02 maybe I find a way to explain that to
04:04 myself but I don't feel the need to go
04:06 down that path just yet how many of you
04:09 understand the general principle of a
04:11 radar dish or a satellite dish no
04:15 satellite dishes are typically used to
04:19 catch waves off out of the space being
04:25 broadcast down from a satellite or
04:27 bounced off the ionosphere and it shaped
04:31 like a concave shape because what ends
04:34 up happening is no matter what goes into
04:36 a satellite dish it reflects back to the
04:40 center this apex Center which is where
04:42 they put the little receiver now back in
04:46 the 70s they were round perfectly round
04:49 and big they had these big clunky
04:52 receivers on there
04:54 later later they discovered they could
04:55 shrink the size of these things by at
04:59 least at least to one-fourth of their
05:01 previous size shape them a bit like kind
05:05 of a serving dish little oval serving
05:07 dish and that's where you get the
05:09 current satellites that are usually
05:10 tacked on to our homes but their is
05:14 based on the curvature this can you know
05:20 this unification of the directions into
05:23 this one location now a transmitter is
05:26 sort of the opposite
05:28 it could broadcast down into a dish and
05:30 jam that frequency way up into space
05:34 okay if any of you've ever been to an
05:37 observatory where you look at the stars
05:39 from a star projector one of the
05:41 interesting things is is if your head is
05:43 close to the wall of one of these
05:45 beautiful domes you can hear the person
05:47 talking on the other side because the
05:50 sound travels perfectly the shape of the
05:54 dome and lands in the ear and it's like
05:55 you could have a conversation with
05:57 someone in a room with a hundred-foot
05:59 dome without yelling because it's gonna
06:02 travel the curve it's beautiful so why
06:06 do people feel us staring at them why do
06:08 we feel when people stare at us hmm
06:12 someone might say well that's
06:14 consciousness and there is something to
06:16 consciousness and we transmit our
06:18 consciousness to the other person I
06:21 don't disagree but what does the medium
06:24 by which consciousness exists and what
06:27 is the medium by which consciousness
06:28 travels ah well what do we mean by stare
06:33 at somebody what is that it means you
06:37 look at me you put your eyeballs at me
06:39 all right well what if you took the
06:43 human skull and you remove the eyeballs
06:47 only in 3d simulation of course settle
06:51 down Tony Podesta you have a wind of
06:57 ether that is doing two things one it is
07:02 reforming your body
07:05 nanosecond to nanosecond picosecond to
07:09 picosecond right you're being refreshed
07:11 constantly just like the current in
07:13 water if the water stopped flowing into
07:16 the current you wouldn't see a little
07:17 tornado anymore it would disappear
07:19 dissipate disappear the concept in your
07:22 mind that it is actually a tornado would
07:24 just vanish because the only calling in
07:26 a tornado because its water shaped like
07:28 that you might call me a human being
07:30 because I am shaped like this and I
07:32 sound like this and if you're here to
07:34 smell this delicious cigar you'd say I
07:36 smell like that but even when occurrence
07:39 in a river and you there's a current a
07:42 little tornado thingy there's still a
07:44 bunch of water around it as well well
07:45 we're the same way we're a human being
07:48 tons of ether flowing around us bouncing
07:51 off of us so now I point these two
07:56 cavities in my skull at somebody well
08:04 I'm made of ether so potentially my
08:07 dielectric wave coming out of the
08:10 collisions of ether hitting me anything
08:13 ricocheting off me well it's ricocheting
08:18 off me in all directions which is why
08:19 some people see auras you're merely
08:23 seeing the frequency of the reflection
08:26 perhaps the orbital pattern but your eye
08:30 sockets are little tiny recessed concave
08:35 cavities bunch ether comes in
08:41 congregates and beams out of your
08:43 eyeball sockets just like the dude in
08:45 x-men and you stare at somebody and the
08:50 longer you stare at someone you are
08:52 actually sending at them an ether a wind
08:56 and on that ether wind if there is any
09:00 intelligent configuration of information
09:02 that your brain synthesize what you call
09:04 your mind
09:05 aka your consciousness something that is
09:08 developed between the body and the soul
09:11 that person is getting those packets of
09:14 information just like a wireless router
09:17 because there's two ways that people
09:19 will look at you and there's two
09:20 feelings that we typically get in a
09:22 broad stroke sense I felt weird someone
09:27 was staring at me and you turn around
09:30 and it's creeper looking at me of God or
09:38 you have this pleasant feeling that
09:40 you're being stared at me because you
09:42 have some confidence that day you know
09:44 you look good maybe you just feel good
09:47 about it you know you're trying so
09:49 looking at me and you look at the cross
09:50 the room and it's love at first sight
09:54 but you sensed it first and then reacted
09:58 to its second I'm always telling you how
10:01 and you know these subatomic particles
10:03 are created by ether how they develop
10:08 into things that are classified as atoms
10:11 right orbital patterns are magnetic
10:16 ricocheting patterns or paths are
10:19 dielectric when those two things banging
10:21 to each other and makes electromagnetism
10:22 wave ethers creating all of that your
10:26 protons in your neutrons well they're
10:28 just in little orbital planets inside a
10:32 photon doesn't really exist a photon is
10:36 a ripple in the pond it's coming at you
10:40 it gets mistaken for a particle because
10:42 the ripple does collide with things and
10:44 effect things and therefore we designate
10:47 it in a way of heat pure information by
10:52 lighting up things because our eyeballs
10:54 are sensitive to that particular
10:55 frequency you know a bat doesn't see
11:00 light a bat see sound but to him there
11:04 is no difference you would see things
11:06 exactly the same as a bat you might not
11:09 have colors but you can see shapes
11:11 that's how that dude can figure out
11:13 where to go okay but now imagine that we
11:18 draw a picture of the human body and we
11:21 acknowledge ether and we hurl it at our
11:25 body let's just say in the standard 3d
11:27 pose that is the Leonardo
11:30 wheel of the human dimension right that
11:33 famous dimension that is used in West
11:35 world first and fallout for its
11:40 ricocheting off of all the little bumps
11:42 and crevices and so five foot woman's
11:45 are going to put off a specific pattern
11:47 six foot five guys putting off a
11:49 slightly different pattern it's
11:51 generally the same shape but it's gonna
11:53 be different a pregnant woman's gonna
11:56 have a big belly and she's gonna project
11:58 in a completely different way a life
12:00 inside of her is gonna add to that so
12:04 each human body is gonna put off a
12:07 different pattern now let's understand
12:12 that concept and our brains first split
12:14 second it's a bunch of beautiful
12:17 ricocheting and orbiting patterns of all
12:20 the ethers that the body doesn't
12:21 actually consume to become the body it
12:24 is just this cloud of really invisible
12:31 protomatter right which is ether if you
12:35 could turn on the glasses where you
12:37 could see that it would just be this
12:38 amazing or if you just dial it into a
12:40 color spectrum saying everything that's
12:41 not an unaccounted-for by the human body
12:43 is a hue of blue so everyone's glowing a
12:46 different blue and you bend your arm and
12:49 you create a little pocket of that stuff
12:51 you make your hand like this and it just
12:53 circles you put your hand like that and
12:55 you move around and now you're
12:57 controlling the pattern of the bounces
13:01 okay now imagine you're watching a
13:04 ballet a really good one and you have a
13:13 story that's being acted out through
13:15 dance and so these actors are thinking
13:20 about a story and their bodies are
13:23 hopping all over the place they're doin
13:24 all this crazy stuff and some of it's
13:26 very sensual and very organic shapes and
13:29 move movements you know they are trying
13:32 to paint shapes as they dance it's not
13:37 just river dancing but River dancing has
13:40 its implications as well
13:43 so you're sitting in the audience sort
13:47 of being Gallagher by there
13:51 II throw winds they're splattering you
13:55 with all kinds of intent all kinds of
13:58 ether away --vs which then provide the
14:01 medium by which the story can travel on
14:03 their consciousness and their belief in
14:05 the story is actors makes it more real
14:08 to you any of you've gone to stage plays
14:12 or ballets or anything like that
14:14 anything it's live
14:15 a musical even just to play it's so much
14:19 more rich to the soul than watching at
14:24 the best movie you've ever seen on the
14:26 best television with the best sound
14:27 system there is nothing like live
14:30 performance and there never ever will be
14:34 not with a VR system now with an AR
14:36 system perhaps the only exception would
14:39 be if we can biologically simulate all
14:43 the senses just like the movie
14:45 brainstorm with Christopher Walken and
14:47 Natalie Wood so now the more that you
14:50 can conceive of this huge reflection of
14:56 all of the ether coming off of your body
14:59 then you can start to understand why
15:01 maybe the universe is the way it is
15:03 especially planet Earth but now let's
15:07 talk about the frequencies that are also
15:10 added to the ricochets and the orbits
15:14 it's pretty well understood that all
15:16 things in the universe are vibrating and
15:19 the only reason why they vibrate is
15:20 because ether is not infinitely dense
15:22 right we're not a big brick of ether
15:24 where there's plenty of negative space
15:26 with nothing in it a true vacuum a true
15:29 vacuum I don't think there's a lot of
15:31 space for any one split second that
15:34 there is space in the universe there's
15:37 most likely ether a particle about to go
15:40 into that space and then keep traveling
15:42 but you are human being and you have
15:45 your own vibrational frequencies which
15:47 are the mass the higher constructive
15:50 ether atoms and those sorts of things
15:52 which then turn into tissues which start
15:55 to turn into organ
15:56 which start to turn into who you are you
15:59 know you have a vibrational frequency of
16:01 your existence and if you've seen the
16:03 old bridges that were tumbling in the
16:05 30s before they figured out that wind
16:07 shear on a bridge will eventually dial
16:10 into the frequency of the cement and the
16:12 steel and the wires and eventually it
16:14 starts to sing with the bridge and then
16:16 it starts to modulate with it a lot of
16:19 this is what the HAARP antenna has been
16:20 patented to create earthquakes and it
16:22 really whether it's because is
16:24 modulating with the earth until it takes
16:26 over that modulation it creates an
16:28 earthquake that's the weapon patented by
16:33 Bernard Easton for the Navy back in 1958
16:38 but now you have your cautiousness which
16:43 is an added frequency on top of your
16:45 being and this isn't hocus-pocus at all
16:49 Kurtz well the gentleman that founded
16:52 the singularity project he believes were
16:55 bag of chemicals there is no soul and we
16:58 are naive to think that there's a an
16:59 extra layer to it apparently he's never
17:02 seen a ghost
17:03 and he's never had an existential
17:05 experience okay let's start with his
17:11 model of humanity first your brain is a
17:15 gigantic collection of neurons that are
17:18 constantly firing what electrons energy
17:23 packets of information that travel
17:25 throughout your mind this temporary
17:28 contract between the body and the soul
17:29 in my opinion but let's just leave the
17:32 soul for a few seconds here and talk
17:35 about it according to him he's going to
17:38 be able to digitize and upload a brain
17:40 to a computer and then you're gonna be
17:42 able to live there and the computer
17:42 you're gonna know how to metabolize
17:44 everything he thought like the body does
17:47 pure fantasy pure fantasy but whatever
17:51 he is trying to grab the grid of your
17:54 brain where every single electron is and
17:57 then take over the program okay
18:00 that grid of electricity is moving and
18:05 it will have an overall mean of
18:07 vibration but if nothing else
18:10 for those of you understand the internet
18:11 just a little bit you know there's
18:13 packets of information traveling every
18:15 time you talk to the Internet you type
18:17 in something in a search field on Google
18:18 in it gets translated into text to get
18:21 sent to a server there's a lookup it
18:23 comes back with the page and boom you
18:25 have information and somewhere on that
18:27 little wire somewhere through that
18:29 wireless Internet the information is
18:34 travelling so you're splashing all of
18:38 this ether everywhere it's it's very
18:39 minut but it's significant enough that a
18:42 human being when stared at it's a
18:45 concentration into their skull of alien
18:49 energy meaning not part of their native
18:53 programming and their brain sends a
18:56 signal into their mind that goes wait a
18:59 minute we're getting interruptive
19:00 signals here what is this you start to
19:03 feel uncomfortable just because it's an
19:06 alien thing it's a new thing that's been
19:07 inserted into your minds if someone
19:09 beamed an idea into your mind or
19:10 something and therefore you look around
19:13 the room to find out why are you feeling
19:15 funny if someone blaring music is
19:19 someone staring at you and you tend to
19:23 have again an orientation of whether
19:25 it's a positive or a negative as you
19:28 start to feel that sensation I have felt
19:30 it a number of times in my lifetime and
19:32 this has come up so many times in
19:35 conversations that I'm making this
19:39 episode so you guys have also seen
19:44 movies on TV where someone's hacking
19:47 into a computer because they want to
19:50 send something to the computer to
19:51 usually either take something out of it
19:53 or put something into it but what's the
19:56 first step that's always dramatized a
19:58 connection someone puts a USB stick in
20:03 someone Jack's into the internet there's
20:05 always some connection point and then
20:07 what happens you take information or you
20:09 send information while taking
20:13 information from someone's mind through
20:15 the technique I'm talking about is
20:16 probably you know it happens because you
20:20 can assume certain certain people empath
20:23 so they be
20:23 basically can look you in the face and
20:25 go oh my god you're feeling this way
20:26 aren't you and you're like oh how do you
20:28 know and it's something very eccentric
20:30 something very developed something very
20:31 mature not just an overall when you look
20:34 like you're tired now yeah I'm tired
20:35 whatever you look like you've been
20:37 crying because I can see your eyes are
20:38 pink it's not a visual indicator at all
20:40 it's an instinctual indicator and many
20:42 of you have done this if not every
20:43 single one of you have done this you do
20:45 it with your children you do with your
20:46 loved ones the more you hang out with
20:49 someone the more you can sense this
20:50 information coming at you
20:52 but with the staring thing it's really
20:55 from you to them you can't help but have
20:58 manifested opinions and ideas about
21:01 someone as you stare at them you think
21:05 someone's attractive you think someone's
21:06 repulsive you think someone's attractive
21:08 but annoying whatever the connection is
21:12 made by staring you inadvertently
21:15 because we have no training and no
21:17 control you send the information over
21:19 the connection but without the stare
21:24 well you could it'd be difficult for you
21:26 to have someone behind you that you saw
21:30 when you walked in the room I always
21:31 think about airport terminals it's where
21:33 you do the most people watching right
21:34 and you see someone who's attractive but
21:37 you're very respectful so you look at
21:39 the person like oh wow that's that's
21:41 something else and you sit down and you
21:43 mind your own business but you hear them
21:45 talking and they sit down behind you
21:47 like a while that really attractive
21:49 persons behind me but if you don't turn
21:52 around and look at that person your
21:54 thoughts are really swirling in your own
21:56 mind if anything you look at the person
21:58 across from you and thinking about the
22:00 person behind you they may look at the
22:01 person behind you go wow that person is
22:03 really attractive because you're sending
22:04 this signal of like this attractive
22:06 person's really near me really near me
22:07 and someone starts looking around for
22:10 someone hot but now imagine if you adopt
22:14 this theory in your mind and you can
22:16 wrap your mind around it what happens
22:19 now when you lay down with your lover
22:22 when you spend a lot of time with your
22:24 family when you spend time with your
22:27 co-workers or you go to a public place
22:30 you know that you're being connected to
22:34 and people's vibes are coming
22:37 you sometimes you need to be overwhelmed
22:40 by the vibe of another person because
22:42 you've had a bad day you know honey just
22:45 just stare in my eyes for a second you
22:47 know touch my body because touching is
22:49 going to turn this up to ten if not a
22:51 million there's people who can heal with
22:57 their hands and it takes a lot to do
23:01 that it you really need to have your
23:03 center core at peace you need to be able
23:07 to empathically figure out what's wrong
23:10 with the other person a little bit of
23:12 medical knowledge won't hurt you as well
23:13 but the second you lay your hands on
23:16 that other person you start to have an
23:19 effect the connection is now broadband
23:22 it's fiber-optic you are now
23:25 transmitting as much as you want in my
23:29 opinion when you touch not sure but I'm
23:32 pretty sure the bandwidth across the
23:34 room isn't quite as strong maybe it's
23:37 super strong but not is that I could do
23:39 anything compared to someone touching
23:42 you now let's take it one step further
23:44 than that what if it is a requirement of
23:48 mankind that we be together physically
23:54 the whole adage takes a village to raise
23:57 a child I've always said that's true
24:01 it was way way true before it was turned
24:04 into a book title what if this is what
24:07 we need to be balanced as a human being
24:09 and so the more that we isolate our
24:12 children by giving giving them game
24:15 consoles cell phones sensationalizing
24:19 and rewarding the dopamine patterns in
24:21 their brains which have to do with being
24:25 rated by another human being on social
24:27 media we tell our daughters that they
24:30 should worry about what boys think about
24:32 them instead of having their own
24:33 opinions about themselves so that when
24:36 they start dating they never stop not
24:38 until the day they die they get married
24:40 they get divorce a date never have a
24:42 moment to themselves meaning they never
24:44 meet themselves the sociopathic nerd at
24:48 home it would have been a normal kid
24:50 but he played too much had too many
24:53 virtual experiences he never got to need
24:56 that connection they're there for the
25:01 grace and sweetness of humanity and so
25:06 they start to feel like an outcast
25:07 because they're running dry on the
25:10 inside those of you in loving
25:13 relationships with your spouse or your
25:16 partner I can tell you unequivocally
25:20 without knowing your situation you will
25:23 go to parties and public events with
25:26 this best friend of yours and you will
25:29 see people by themselves or broken
25:32 couples they're together but it's not
25:34 right it's not working out and you know
25:38 that when you go home and you lay next
25:39 to that person hell even if you have two
25:42 different beds but you get to wake up
25:44 with that person it's been time with
25:45 that person get ready in the morning eat
25:48 your breakfast come home with each other
25:50 you had a bad day you can call that
25:51 person up and they can sort of send you
25:54 that that that pavlo nyan training for
25:57 your frequency which is their voice it's
25:59 not as good as them being in the same
26:00 room with you but it triggers all the
26:03 positive dopamine in your mind that
26:05 things are going to be okay and what if
26:11 what if the people that control the
26:13 world have known some form of this for a
26:18 very long time and so when they socially
26:22 re-engineer the world it is so subtle
26:27 they want us to pay attention to two big
26:30 things and perhaps they create the big
26:32 things so that we pay attention to them
26:34 and they they're important too we have
26:35 to get glyphosate out of food and
26:37 fluoride out of our toothpaste and water
26:38 and etc etc down the line with the
26:41 entire time they're laughing because
26:43 what they've done is they've socially
26:45 engineered us away from each other and
26:47 so our cup runs dry and the very purpose
26:54 for a soul to attach to a body in the
26:56 first place becomes a moot point
27:00 and you start to get depressed because
27:02 you're like well
27:04 there's something inside me that says
27:07 something's missing something's wrong
27:09 and life has these these moments were
27:15 like I haven't ridden a bicycle and I
27:18 have no idea how many years it's been
27:20 over 20 years since I got on a bicycle
27:22 and rode but I know if I got on when I
27:24 could write one but you might be nervous
27:28 still I might be nervous for the first
27:30 split second I get on I wouldn't be but
27:32 let's just say I was well the more you
27:36 dig yourself a hole by staying by
27:39 yourself and buying into virtual
27:40 experiences especially social media you
27:44 could be surrounded by your family but
27:46 you're ignoring them because you're on
27:47 your cell phone and then when you go out
27:49 to public you're not so good at it maybe
27:53 even think you're good at it but you're
27:54 not because practice makes perfect but
27:59 meanwhile slowly you rot inside you
28:04 don't have the fuel your engine doesn't
28:06 start like it used to and then we add on
28:09 top of all of this basic stuff because
28:11 that example right there has nothing to
28:12 do with a tonne of thought that first
28:16 example I just gave you is mere physical
28:19 connection to other human beings such as
28:21 you will get human rewards for being
28:24 with other humans and then you introduce
28:29 what we know is going on which is divide
28:32 and conquer they introduce circumstance
28:35 after circumstance threatening our way
28:39 of life America is getting threatened
28:42 with socialism someone who believes that
28:45 the kid is nine months old as a human
28:47 being that has the right to live should
28:49 be protected now but these other states
28:51 think you can kill it simply because you
28:54 think your body might get a little
28:56 changed by having a baby really
29:00 controversial issues they've lied to us
29:03 in history a million times bunch of
29:05 people believe lies bunch of us know the
29:07 truth or more truth than the lies we
29:09 know that they're they our lives now
29:12 we're divided now not only do we have a
29:15 reduced connection pool with other human
29:17 beings
29:18 of what is popular but when we do make
29:21 that connection
29:22 we're like a horrible Twitter feed a
29:24 horrible LinkedIn feed well we are just
29:28 instead of paying attention and Linkedin
29:30 is the biggest [ __ ] joke on planet
29:32 earth you're supposed to connect and do
29:35 business but what is it it's a bunch of
29:38 liberals running around got tired of
29:41 Twitter they're running all their
29:42 virtual signaling [ __ ] on on log on
29:45 LinkedIn I guess thinking that's going
29:47 to make them more virtuous to get hired
29:49 when if anything they're demonstrating
29:51 they can't focus on their careers but
29:55 it's all acidic I just gave you some
29:57 acidity from my opinions of these
29:59 situations so now when we connect the
30:03 frequencies bad well what happens when
30:06 you're overwhelmed by a particular
30:08 frequency I always tell you if you want
30:11 to get healed from stress let's just say
30:15 you go to a lake a pond preferably a
30:19 lake but a deep pond and you bring that
30:22 water up to your neck you sit on the
30:24 noodle get your favorite drink get some
30:26 friends they're all doing the same thing
30:27 and you just sit and chill and talk and
30:31 that lake is going to overwhelm your
30:33 body's frequency its ether Oh frequency
30:36 because what is water super dense ether
30:38 all right I mean we're technically
30:41 denser born s Tufts around you it's
30:43 gonna win the frequency battle and it
30:45 will calm your stress down I think you
30:48 know that water just like oh my god how
30:49 many of you take showers before you go
30:51 to bed see you sleep better now even
30:54 though it's chaotic water some people
30:56 take baths that's even better you sleep
30:58 like a baby because your frequency has
31:01 been settled down or unified I've told
31:05 you the numerous experiments where was
31:10 theirs to two very unique experiments
31:13 I've told you guys about the ten monkey
31:16 experiment we're monkeys there's really
31:20 hundred monkeys but they were kept in
31:21 this Agra dome and they taught one
31:24 monkey a really complex trick took him
31:27 two weeks or something to learn the
31:28 trick to push his liver and make a
31:30 pellet come out so he's
31:31 food put him back with the tribe watched
31:34 him grabbed a monkey that hadn't had any
31:36 contact with the other one pulled him in
31:38 he didn't half the time after about six
31:40 monkeys they all just went anywhere
31:42 ding-ding don't specifically tracking
31:45 which ones had contact with the other
31:49 was but the one that had the least
31:51 amount of contact with the ones that are
31:52 too gone through they were transmitting
31:55 information through this connection
31:58 because monkeys connect and they mostly
32:01 connect by touching each other but they
32:03 connect with information so while monkey
32:06 touches no one touch to no one touches a
32:07 note and he's carrying that boon of how
32:10 to do the pellet thing until it gets to
32:12 the one the other experiment is when you
32:14 touch four heads for I think it's twenty
32:16 five minutes or something like that with
32:18 another human being
32:19 they pulled the two humans apart put
32:21 them in RF proof rooms radio frequency
32:23 proof rooms show unperson
32:26 card a color something and the other
32:29 person can guess it very accurately way
32:31 above average for a very short period of
32:33 time until the connection is lost
32:35 ether goes through the RF proof barrier
32:39 100% no problem man can't stop ether
32:44 unless maybe they layered the room in a
32:47 plasma
32:48 six wall system maybe that would block
32:52 completely the connection with the other
32:56 person I told you several times on the
32:59 show you could have a Skype session with
33:01 loved one best TV best sound system best
33:04 headset broadband crystal-clear like you
33:09 just do it in your house then go and sit
33:13 on the sofa together and look each other
33:14 in the eyes all of a sudden it's so much
33:18 better I've touched you guys the trick
33:21 of take your fingers and cover up your
33:25 eyes get someone right in front of you
33:27 right cover up the eyes say how what do
33:30 you feel with me right now and they're
33:31 they've lost the connection you bring it
33:34 down you look at them again boom this
33:37 huge human connection happens alright
33:41 well remember the feeling of being
33:43 stared at what if you're putting
33:45 your receptors directly in line with
33:49 someone else's eyeballs they're
33:52 projecting their consciousness slashed
33:55 their connection first consciousness
33:57 second right into your eyeballs full
33:59 connection they're doing the same to you
34:01 and that is why the eyes are the
34:03 gateways to the soul this changes
34:08 everything
34:09 massage huge I've had enough massages in
34:15 my lifetime to know that well I put is
34:20 you this way to know that this this
34:22 contact with the human body is massive
34:24 from you know my girlfriend's whatever
34:26 my loved ones to professionals and
34:31 what's funny is the more money I pay for
34:33 a massage the crappier it is I'll be at
34:35 some resort sucks that person hates
34:39 their [ __ ] life and they're giving me
34:41 that vibe I usually try to make a little
34:45 bit of small talk with the masseuse
34:46 before they touch me and if there's if
34:49 they start saying you know I'll make
34:50 your commitment from this point forward
34:52 and if they start saying to me is my
34:55 last one I can't wait to get off work
34:57 I'm gonna say you need to take a hike
34:59 you're not ready to touch me man I need
35:02 someone who considers this an art that's
35:05 why it goes specifically an Asian
35:08 community to get this and the older the
35:10 woman the better
35:11 she is like dialed and it is a religion
35:14 that you typically come with a bunch of
35:17 philosophical training from their family
35:19 from their from their environment it's
35:21 not just a job and they know they have
35:24 responsibilities and I've had a ladies
35:27 you know touch me that just was like
35:29 this is wrong with you right one of them
35:31 went to my feet touching my feet and
35:33 just like oh okay
35:34 then she went right to my not and just
35:37 never touched my back at all it was
35:39 right for the nut I know this is where
35:40 it is there's a map to the human body
35:43 and it's in your feet and some people
35:46 know it and when they do it's phenomenal
35:50 we have become so drunk on irrelevant
35:55 crap in our lives especially as it
35:57 relates to technology
35:59 that we are losing our essence as humans
36:02 and there was a funny thing for the
36:06 probably one or two of you that have
36:08 ever played the role-playing game
36:10 Shadowrun from the books not from the
36:12 videogames you will have read about
36:14 something called the essence and it's a
36:16 futuristic role-playing game where you
36:19 can substitute your biology for our
36:23 transhumanism implant could be you have
36:27 your whole nervous system replaced you
36:28 could have your bones replaced you could
36:30 put an implant a computer memory all
36:31 this other kind of stuff in your mind
36:33 almost everyone in the future and that
36:35 game has at least memory and a hard
36:37 drives type storage unit inside their
36:39 body they literally could put a keyboard
36:42 in their temple but there's a there's a
36:47 repercussion there's a disadvantage of
36:51 replacing part of your body because what
36:53 ends up happening is there's an essence
36:55 meter and you can't exceed your essence
36:57 meter unless you become a cyborg and
37:01 that's the precipice by which the
37:03 technology starts to control you and
37:05 you're just this weird dialect host for
37:10 the robot see Doctor Who what's
37:15 fascinating to me is I'm in a circle of
37:17 very good friends and and brilliant
37:20 professionals and I mean they're on the
37:22 edge of human consciousness by studying
37:27 some of the most cutting edge thinking
37:30 theories that have ever been uttered on
37:32 stage in a book and a lecture and a
37:36 personal conversation and they marvel at
37:41 these things and when I try to step into
37:43 the conversation and say well you know
37:45 it's because of this this and this and I
37:49 can make it make sense
37:50 it so quickly overwhelms their paradigm
37:54 and capacity to think this stuff that I
38:00 can't get anywhere in the conversation
38:03 nothing wrong with their intelligence
38:05 but this is such a drastic paradigm
38:08 shift it's gonna take a while it's gonna
38:10 take a while to get it to sink in
38:12 and we're here by listening to these
38:16 crazy episodes I've been making you
38:17 you're here you're ready to step off
38:20 you're already on board I'm willing to
38:22 bet so what do we do with this
38:25 information because it's pretty
38:28 overwhelming well one you could conduct
38:31 some experiments stare at somebody
38:34 trying to be a creeper
38:35 well maybe you experiment with that
38:37 thought process and then it says it look
38:39 at you you smile and you're like oh I'm
38:40 sorry I'm just playing with you
38:43 but you'll have people that are
38:46 considered nuts because they tell you
38:49 they understand the frequency of
38:51 consciousness I know folks that have
38:55 said they see auras and people don't
38:59 believe them I told a story a long time
39:02 ago of a buddy of mine who was renting a
39:04 room in a house there's a woman down the
39:06 hallway who cut his hair cut everyone
39:09 else hair in the whole house and she's
39:12 kept telling everyone she could see
39:13 auras and he just kind of blew it off
39:15 she could see the color and the she knew
39:17 the color table and the intent of what
39:20 that is or the repercussion of that aura
39:24 and he was out with his seven-year
39:28 fiancee going to dinner and she breaks
39:31 up with him on the way to dinner he has
39:36 her drop him off I guess she was driving
39:39 he walks home he walks in the house and
39:43 he's going down the hallway to his buddy
39:47 and he's knocking on the door he's like
39:49 man I need to talk to somebody or it's a
39:50 guy friend is it's a big long hallway in
39:53 this house supposedly I think I was
39:56 there one time but he said he heard this
39:58 shriek at the end of the hallway behind
40:01 him and it scared the crap out of him
40:04 and he turned around and she is looking
40:06 at him like this had her hand over her
40:09 mouth for those own podcasts and she's
40:10 just tearing up and she said Brian
40:14 what's wrong and he was so spooked he
40:20 didn't talk to her about it and he moved
40:22 out of that place soon after that
40:24 because it was so
40:25 exactly the way she looked on her face
40:28 would be the morning you would feel for
40:30 the crushing blow to his chest he had
40:32 his back to her this guy's very legit
40:36 dude very honest Joe she saw his aura
40:41 projected by ether his consciousness
40:46 road on the ether and gave it its color
40:49 probably and she was tuned into it and
40:55 there was a book that came out in the
40:57 90s and I cannot remember the name of it
41:00 but it was about a so it's a it's a book
41:03 that tells you that there's a place you
41:05 can go to learn how to see auras and my
41:11 uncle was really into it my uncle aunt
41:13 both her into it and they got in the
41:15 book I think I have it anymore it was
41:18 all about this and I remember reading
41:19 this and having no context to process
41:23 this so I thought maybe they had gone
41:24 off the deep end a little bit but he was
41:28 very experimental he didn't commit to it
41:30 he just said what do you think about
41:31 this book what do you think about that
41:32 remember thinking why are you asking me
41:35 man
41:35 you know I'm very flattered you're
41:37 asking me but you know I just didn't
41:39 have anything to give him I couldn't
41:40 latch on to the idea if he asked me
41:43 today I would really put money down he
41:45 doesn't believe this at all anymore and
41:47 I do and we would have an interesting
41:49 conversation we we talked a lot about
41:53 why I'm in an episode on friendship and
41:56 it's a very important episode because it
41:58 is it helps you manage your life and
42:01 pick your friends properly and evaluate
42:03 your friends and the density of your
42:05 relationship so that you call them the
42:07 right thing in your mind acquaintance
42:09 friend best friend whatever you need to
42:13 know the difference of all those things
42:14 and there's there's a technique to do it
42:16 it's not just some frivolous episode but
42:19 now if you apply this theory to the
42:22 people you pick and including your life
42:24 as friends it's a big deal isn't it
42:28 because there's a lot of us that went
42:30 through the stage in our life and maybe
42:32 some of you are still in this stage it's
42:34 hard to get out of the stage if you care
42:36 about for your fellow man but you know
42:38 the old adage
42:39 if this person's a fixer-upper and
42:43 you're gonna fix them everyone goes
42:46 through this I went through at least ten
42:47 years of this in a chronic way and a
42:49 date a girl it's not good for me hanging
42:51 out with the buddy of mine is not really
42:53 good for me and I'll get him on track
42:55 and I'll fix her and done and it never
42:57 works right psychologists laugh their
43:00 asses off at that idea yes that's what
43:03 they try to do all day even though they
43:07 say they don't they're trying to they're
43:09 trying to use a backhanded methodology
43:11 that the patient doesn't recognize by
43:15 getting them to look inside and see
43:17 positive and negative and that sort of
43:19 thing but now imagine if we could come
43:22 up with the science of this on paper to
43:25 say look ether is everywhere it is the
43:29 substrate it is the wireless technology
43:32 that we use to communicate with each
43:34 other and once the connections made a
43:39 whole bunch of stuff happens it changes
43:43 us as human beings to hang out with a
43:46 person so it's fun to hang out with
43:49 people that inspire you because they
43:52 will inspire you and infect you with
43:54 their good habits and every single one
43:56 of us most likely knows one person has
43:58 done that to us it could be a relative
43:59 it could just be a boss a buddy well we
44:03 probably have a longer list of people
44:05 that have taken us down that dated
44:08 someone who suffered from a chronic
44:10 depression and I didn't know it when I
44:12 started the relationship but it was a
44:14 very educational experience for me
44:16 because she was aware that she had this
44:19 issue and she couldn't change it and I
44:24 caught her crying one day in the car as
44:25 we were headed off to lunch and we'd had
44:27 a great morning a great night and she
44:30 wasn't on that you know cycle it affects
44:33 women sometimes and I looked over and
44:38 she is silently really crying hard like
44:43 mouth open crying and I said What's
44:47 Wrong sweetie you know and she said I
44:49 don't know it was
44:53 one of the most I don't know shocking
44:57 moments of my life to think that anyone
45:00 in the world could be that emotionally
45:03 depressed and not have a single clue
45:05 could be a chemical thing who knows now
45:10 in her case it might have been something
45:12 chemical and it's not something that
45:13 necessarily my good vibe is gonna fix
45:15 but we know that there's plenty of
45:17 people out there there Debbie downers as
45:19 they like to say on SNL so we must
45:21 choose our friends and our circle
45:23 carefully you're not going to fix
45:26 anybody up if they choose to use you as
45:29 a mentor and be inspired by you and and
45:32 uplifted by you well that's something
45:33 you're not going to be aware of unless
45:35 they look you in the face and go it was
45:36 you you staying true in in tough times
45:41 times that were tougher than the time I
45:43 was going through made it easier for me
45:47 I was abruptly dumped once by a
45:50 girlfriend we patched it up later but we
45:54 were engaged and she asked me to ask her
45:56 to marry me and I asked her and I felt a
45:59 little silly doing it and then she
46:03 changed her mind and I remember I found
46:06 out a morning before going to church and
46:09 then we were in the church parking lot
46:10 and she told me this and there was more
46:12 to it than just I want to be with you it
46:14 was a life destiny thing of where she
46:16 was going to be in the world and that
46:17 sort of thing but my my youth minister
46:21 who turned out to be convicted of
46:25 pedophilia he said something really wise
46:27 to me and he cuz he was married to like
46:29 one of the best gals in the whole church
46:32 and I'm standing over by this wall
46:34 staring at traffic and I'm supposed to
46:36 go into church I'm supposed to go into
46:38 the room where she's gonna be
46:39 and she's not dumping me for somebody
46:41 else that probably would have been a
46:43 little tougher but he said you know I
46:49 know how you feel of course I'm saying
46:52 to myself there's no way you know how I
46:54 feel and he said look before I found
46:56 so-and-so my wife I went through three
46:59 other girls and I didn't dump them they
47:02 dumped me and it felt utterly horrible
47:04 and I thought I was going to get married
47:06 to these women
47:07 and I don't date him when I won't try to
47:08 marry and I lit it up and he convinced
47:11 me quite accurately that he did know how
47:14 I felt at least in a deep broad-stroke
47:18 manner and so that helped me I got
47:23 through it
47:24 he connected with me gave me a boon to
47:28 get through this adventure of mine how
47:31 would we redesign society with this
47:35 knowledge will be rebuild our schools
47:38 differently would we rebuild well I'll
47:42 tell you one thing we would do we would
47:44 get rid of this horrible thing in
47:46 America called Common Core which assigns
47:49 troves of homework to a child assigning
47:52 homework to a child means you're not
47:54 doing your [ __ ] job as a teacher
47:55 you're not you do not get the right to
47:58 give kid more work as they go home you
48:01 don't you don't have that right you need
48:04 to figure out how to teach a kid in the
48:05 time that they start class for that year
48:08 and the time they in class for that year
48:10 while they're at school okay if the kids
48:13 sick for a week because he got
48:15 meningitis or whatever sure maybe a
48:18 little bit of makeup but that would be
48:19 what a kid would expect but it'd
48:21 probably be as soon as you can actually
48:23 sit at home and think oh honey just
48:25 bombs going off here as soon as you can
48:27 sit home and think you're gonna get your
48:29 homework at home don't fall behind
48:31 right but kids would need to connect
48:34 more there was an interesting thing said
48:38 that once you get out of grade school so
48:40 in the United States I'm pretty sure
48:41 this is the way it is in most places
48:43 around the world
48:44 you get recess a couple times a day
48:47 between kindergarten and sixth grade
48:49 well actually sixth grades gone off to
48:50 middle school now 6 K through 5 but soon
48:55 as you get in middle school and how
48:56 there's no recess whatsoever
48:58 there's homeroom it's a little bit of
48:59 weird thing you get your lunch but
49:02 you're trying to eat we don't have any
49:05 human connection the older you get they
49:07 shut down your human connection we work
49:11 all day long all day long and there's no
49:14 you get a break you know when you're at
49:17 work most places kind of just have a
49:20 loose
49:20 honor system and that works sometimes
49:22 but you're not supposed to disturb your
49:24 employee next to you you shouldn't
49:26 because maybe they're thinking what if
49:29 there were breaks with a whole company
49:31 you could just have 15 minutes off go to
49:34 the break room walk outside smoke your
49:37 cigarette whatever but talk to each
49:39 other communicate maybe talk about work
49:42 maybe talk about what you're gonna do
49:43 this weekend but connect as human beings
49:47 we know that eating glyphosate will give
49:50 you cancer and kill you it's in all of
49:52 our food that's GMO it's now in our
49:55 water supply because they can't filter
49:57 the crap out 100% all kinds of [ __ ] in
50:01 our water now we don't want that in our
50:05 system and but Monsanto is losing you
50:07 know billion dollar lawsuits every six
50:10 months now because they're finally
50:11 getting precedents to be sued but now
50:14 what if social media was recognized as a
50:18 poison the more you spend in a phone
50:23 pretending to have 500 friends but you
50:27 never talked to a human being on the
50:28 outside for the most part you're getting
50:32 sick inside and what's the sick person
50:35 gonna do with society you know there's a
50:38 lot of these ffs to go around the world
50:40 but there are some that are very legit I
50:43 think you know one of the worst ones was
50:46 in Columbine two kids hit a an epic
50:52 level of sociopathic behavior they were
50:56 the weirdos of school were these trench
50:58 coats and all that stuff right they were
51:00 the most outwardly profound earthly
51:03 world kids that had ever developed in
51:07 that area before parents weren't
51:10 engaging them for whatever reason they
51:13 didn't get on the right track to get
51:15 approval by their friends and so they
51:16 didn't click into school to have a
51:20 rewarding system within the paradigm of
51:22 the school so what did they do they said
51:24 we're gonna kill everybody in this
51:25 school what do you think that comes from
51:29 and there's a ton of this now if someone
51:33 convinces a bunch
51:34 kids and their late teens and early 20s
51:38 that you know capitalism is their
51:40 problem that they might join a fascist
51:43 group that's called anti-fascism and run
51:46 around doing massive bodily harm while
51:50 cowardly wearing a disguise it's because
51:55 they've lost connection with society and
51:58 society's lost connection with them it
52:01 goes two ways men it's probably more of
52:03 responsibility of society to grab our
52:06 children as soon as they're born and to
52:09 mandate that there's some sort of
52:11 connection with these kids isn't it
52:14 interesting that in a lot of places you
52:16 have to have a dog license to own a dog
52:18 a license to own lots of pets even a pet
52:23 bee why is that why do you have to have
52:26 a license for a living creature because
52:31 if you suck they could take the dog away
52:34 it could take the creature away from you
52:36 I don't think there's any do you know
52:39 how to handle a dog to have a dog in the
52:42 license itself I've never had one before
52:44 but it seems like I think I think a lot
52:47 of us know that we've had this feeling
52:49 of like some people aren't fit to be
52:52 parents so what do we do can't just get
52:58 in everyone's business you can't just
52:59 tell random people you can't have a kid
53:01 yet you haven't proven that you
53:02 understand how to have a kid but you
53:03 know it was really funny when I was a
53:07 young man and in the Catholic Church and
53:09 those of you are Catholic you know all
53:11 about this or are former Catholics let's
53:14 just say you got married in Catholic
53:15 Church you'll really know what I'm
53:16 talking about what do you have to do
53:18 before you get married in Catholic
53:20 Church and what happens in a lot of
53:22 churches that's not mandatory but you do
53:24 it anyway because this is a smart thing
53:25 to do you will meet with and as it's so
53:29 funny and pushing the Catholic Church
53:31 you got this you know homosexual father
53:34 or whatever and the Catholic Church has
53:37 never been with the woman in his life
53:38 telling you how to you know the guy on
53:41 how to be with be with a woman but they
53:43 try to do marriage counseling before you
53:45 get married to try to make sure you
53:46 understand the value
53:47 that's at stake here because they have
53:49 to deal with the divorces and all the
53:51 confessions and fallout of the whole
53:53 thing it's a lot better in normal
53:55 churches where people are married and
53:56 usually their forensics is successful if
53:58 there are pasture they've kind of dealt
54:00 with this whole thing so they try to
54:02 give you good advice to pull it together
54:05 but like I said almost in my first
54:07 episode that was a self-help sort of
54:10 self-improvement episode I said would
54:13 none of us get a manual for life some
54:16 people are smart and they go buy books
54:18 to figure out what they don't know at
54:19 least get an inkling of what they don't
54:21 know but with this ether projection
54:23 model it's really important super
54:29 important that you understand what's
54:31 about to hit you in the face if you say
54:33 if you have a child you never had one
54:35 before they cry they cry for some very
54:38 specific reasons they're bored that's
54:41 the one parents don't understand the
54:42 most they're hungry in their tired bored
54:48 is usually what I call the protest cry
54:49 you can get them to shut up almost
54:51 instantaneously as long as you can
54:53 occupy their mind they're living beings
54:56 just sitting in that sitting in the
54:58 freaking you know the car seat forever
55:01 you know these parents just carry with
55:02 their kids in car seats everywhere they
55:04 go courtesy car seat courtesy courtesy
55:05 get the kid out of the car seat well
55:08 it's gonna give them bed sores to begin
55:09 with and hold them right in front that's
55:11 what you do with my kid a holder right
55:13 in front of me I've done it with a bunch
55:14 of babies it's the greatest thing to be
55:16 crying and crying and crying I look over
55:18 and the kids in a [ __ ] car seat
55:19 sitting in the living room it's like
55:21 really what is this a [ __ ] dog you
55:24 know I mean even doggie wouldn't treat a
55:25 dog like that right so I unstrap the kid
55:27 and it's crying to beat the band you
55:30 know get earplugs if you have a problem
55:32 with that I just put them on my chest
55:34 facing the room and I just kind of you
55:37 know pop them up and down because that
55:39 feels good and I just walk them around
55:41 the room and they're gonna keep crying
55:43 for a little while it's not gonna work
55:44 immediately sometimes but boy I've had
55:46 my little nice voice she just showed up
55:48 in two seconds so it was awesome you
55:50 just take him around the room walk
55:51 outside if you can't pick up a flower
55:54 they see colors and neat things and they
55:57 just oh that's what I wanted man I can't
56:00 talk you
56:01 I'm not a [ __ ] [ __ ] sitting here
56:02 show me something cool dad boom it works
56:07 one little kids against my chest and so
56:10 my soul my heart and my love of this
56:13 child my protective nature around this
56:15 child whom they immediately feel that
56:17 they're like okay now I don't worry
56:19 about my environment anymore I'm not on
56:20 the ground so the dog can eat my face
56:22 because someone thinks that you know
56:24 your pitbulls don't do anything to
56:25 anybody you know a lot of them don't
56:28 some of them do be careful my friend had
56:30 his whole head torn off by a Doberman
56:33 pincer top of you got scalped didn't
56:36 have any hair his whole life and you
56:40 know what his name was
56:40 hairy man no joke no joke the connection
56:46 I told you the story I learned in
56:48 psychology class I took psychology twice
56:51 I took one in Ventura College and one in
56:52 DeAnza College because I lost all my
56:54 credits heard the same story twice I
56:57 tried to look this up and I couldn't
56:58 find it anywhere it's frustrating
57:00 because I wouldn't have made this up in
57:01 a million years but they told me this
57:03 story that someone had the brilliant
57:05 idea to take the is it the paternity
57:10 ward where all the little kids are at
57:12 they're born Ely sitting those little
57:13 glass cases so the parents can look
57:16 through the window let's mine and they
57:19 said this time we're gonna do the
57:20 experiment all these babies we're not
57:21 going to touch him we're gonna feed him
57:23 but we're not gonna hug them and hold
57:25 them and the way the story was told to
57:28 me in psych class was that a bunch of
57:30 them started dying
57:31 they found it just SIDS the whole room
57:34 was like dying and they started rushing
57:36 to pick up all the kids that were still
57:38 alive and they were still dying in their
57:39 arms and they you know they kind of knew
57:46 what went wrong you didn't hug the kid
57:48 but why did the kid check out well one
57:52 is no human connection how many of you
57:57 have started a motor on him on a
57:59 lawnmower first time you brought it home
58:02 from the hardware store BAM no problem
58:05 starts up two or three years later one
58:08 two three four it takes a while to get
58:10 it rolling right but what if a baby it's
58:14 good for the first
58:15 few minutes but you need to give it some
58:17 love you need to connect with it send
58:20 your consciousness to it maybe it needs
58:22 your ether who knows
58:23 and they didn't touch those kids and
58:27 they biologically and mentally and
58:29 soulfully checked up checked out they're
58:31 like we're in the wrong place man I
58:32 don't know what happened to this little
58:35 cycle of humans here but they obviously
58:37 don't want us here they aren't even
58:38 touching us and you know they're sitting
58:41 there looking each other through glass
58:42 going you want to check out yeah man
58:44 let's go reset you know screw these
58:45 [ __ ] BAM they're all out in the
58:49 connection ether projection
58:52 communication now this next thing I'm
58:55 going to say is gonna sound sexist or a
58:57 little biased it is simply because I'm a
58:59 street male and I don't have a lot of
59:01 male friends that have told me this
59:03 story but I've dated a few females and
59:05 had plenty conversations with some that
59:08 were let's say sexually active very
59:12 quickly and lost the entire paradigm for
59:16 their entire lifetime in some cases some
59:18 pulled it out the last segment that's
59:19 pretty rare where they they never found
59:24 love sex was always a physical
59:27 stimulation thing and therefore it
59:29 diminished very quickly over time these
59:32 people are unable to ever experience the
59:34 full spectrum of physical satisfaction
59:35 because of it and I was very puzzled by
59:41 this I was like you know well in fact it
59:44 was a mistake that one girl told me
59:47 something about herself that then I
59:51 repeated to other girls and this became
59:53 a pattern and her I was turn used to say
59:57 something fairly wise as much as he
59:59 would say horrible things to women
60:00 almost unanimously for 30 years but this
60:04 woman told me she goes you know what my
60:06 father was a marine and my mother was a
60:08 nurse I said okay fact no no sorry sorry
60:11 her mother was a nun excuse me so that's
60:14 wild he got her out of the communist and
60:20 she said my family never said I loved
60:23 you and then we didn't hug each other at
60:27 all
60:27 I'm sitting there going well and
60:29 and doesn't say I love you it's a
60:32 religious institution where love is the
60:34 very foundation of the institution and
60:36 there's no marine I could maybe
60:38 understand he's hardened battle-hardened
60:40 you know you never know
60:41 my father was old enough to be in
60:43 Vietnam and I think he was so you could
60:46 be a PTSD there could be a reason for
60:47 that but the mom strange and so I
60:51 repeated that question you know that I
60:54 asked the Future people that I met with
60:56 this issue and it was no hugs are
61:01 limited limited physical interaction
61:03 usually some abandonment parents going
61:06 out too much and leaving the kid at home
61:08 and the love was just never vocalized
61:12 and so this connection at a very
61:15 formative time in their life never
61:18 happened and therefore the kernel of
61:21 love connecting to a physical
61:23 interaction thus making love never
61:26 surfaced the ones that you know had very
61:30 few partners and held out maybe not for
61:33 marriage but at least held out for the
61:34 people that they're getting engaged to
61:35 they make love they can't see in any
61:39 other way connection lost connection
61:43 never made can result of some some
61:46 serious things what did Howard Stern
61:48 always ask a porn star what issues do
61:52 you have with your father I thought that
61:54 was really funny and he went for that
61:56 question every single time because there
61:58 was always a story no I won't even go
62:04 into it you can imagine what these girls
62:06 would say but they said every answer in
62:07 the book for 30 years connection never
62:14 made or connection lost now some of you
62:17 will be deprived of those things and you
62:19 will extra focus on those things to get
62:21 those things in life and therefore
62:24 you're you're almost extra sensitive to
62:26 it you're making extra love right I mean
62:28 it happens right I remember going over
62:31 to my friends houses and because my mom
62:33 was very functional very functional very
62:36 loving but not I always heard I had my
62:39 grandmother's around me they were always
62:40 huggy and you know give me kisses and
62:42 stuff and so you
62:43 and always complimenting me you know
62:45 whether I was you know worthy of any of
62:47 the compliments as well as things but go
62:49 to my friends houses and I'd see their
62:51 moms and some of these moms are just
62:53 luscious things man they're just cooking
62:56 all the crazy good stuff for you and
62:58 they're so pathetic they dial into you
63:00 their life is is dedicated to you as a
63:03 child and I remember going over and just
63:06 going wow this feels good this is what a
63:08 house probably should feel like right so
63:10 I doubled down on that world for when I
63:13 had a kid I want to make sure I was with
63:17 a woman that would provide that to my
63:19 child I have struggled for 430 shows to
63:26 connect the soul with the body now part
63:30 of it's still a mystery in terms of
63:32 exactly the inception point when it
63:33 connects to you in in how it stays on us
63:37 and that sort of thing on a day to day
63:38 basis but this is probably the furthest
63:45 I've taken it such that I believe that
63:47 I've come up with a protocol of the mass
63:51 universe as dictated by ether and the
63:54 consciousness frequency which is your
63:56 mind your temporary state of being and
63:58 then of course things are driven by this
64:02 innate identity which is you which Freud
64:06 called your heed and Freud said our ID's
64:10 are you know scared little children
64:12 what-have-you I'm not terribly convinced
64:14 that that's necessarily a unified
64:18 constant in all humans I think that was
64:20 perhaps how he viewed his insides again
64:23 Freud's whole book is about himself what
64:27 else could it be about you might think
64:29 he derived it all from his patients no
64:31 he got it from himself and then he
64:34 tested his patience and because there is
64:36 a archetype of typology and symbology
64:39 that is generally correct with his
64:43 compartmentalization of the it'd and the
64:45 character in the persona he was onto
64:48 something
64:48 he really was sure you can put
64:51 behavioral models over that but honestly
64:54 we know we pretend to be people when
64:56 we're
64:57 public and we don't know anyone we
64:59 reserved our character our true being I
65:03 swear I don't swear around random
65:06 strangers if I'd you know I don't go to
65:07 a job interview and swear so I put on a
65:10 persona I tried to keep it as true as
65:13 possible and a subset of the truth is
65:14 still the truth if they asked me
65:18 something I would be honest with them if
65:20 the boss starts to swear a little bit I
65:22 might take a little a little zinger here
65:24 and there but I'd maybe I'll pull back
65:29 until I get to know the person better
65:31 maybe they're testing me who knows right
65:34 button others apart that's deep down
65:36 inside which is birthing these other two
65:40 layers it is my instinct in my opinion
65:44 my soul has an instinct you know I told
65:47 you guys at the very beginning of season
65:49 1 that compatibility with another human
65:54 being is really dictated by your purpose
65:56 in this universe and not what you like
65:57 in this universe there's so many people
66:01 things I like scary movies they like
66:02 scary movies I like to eat they like to
66:04 breathe and they like to breathe and so
66:05 you convince yourself with a bunch of
66:06 Trotsky's that you're super compatible
66:08 and then it just blows apart second you
66:10 try to live together or spend any
66:12 concentrated time together well the
66:15 difference is probably related to maybe
66:18 one of you wants to help other people
66:19 and the other person is like me me me me
66:22 me I've dated a very narcissistic
66:25 sociopathic me in my lifetime and it is
66:29 so simple to misunderstand them and it's
66:33 so simple for us to create images of
66:36 people that aren't what they really are
66:38 and so you're trying to do the Fixer up
66:40 thing but it's not a conscious
66:42 fixer-upper thing it's like your
66:45 nostalgia for what you would love them
66:47 to be is overwhelming your recognition
66:51 system of what they really are right in
66:53 front of your face but to take some of
66:58 the the think tank stuff that I've kind
67:00 of been working with recently if we were
67:04 to walk into a true think tank of
67:06 intellectual capacity and bringing this
67:09 theory to the table
67:10 there's 50 other people in the broom
67:14 they would look at this theory if they
67:18 believed what I'm saying maybe I think
67:20 you really are may be onto something
67:21 right one there be a group of folks that
67:25 will go off to try to validate it a
67:26 little bit better but immediately they
67:29 would be applying it to every aspect of
67:31 human existence how does this affect a
67:34 child a teenager an adult an elderly
67:38 person how does it affect the dynamic
67:40 between a child and a parent between a
67:43 village a city a country a planet how
67:47 would you use it to improve education
67:50 etc down the line every distinction of
67:53 human existence they would apply this
67:55 theory to it so I'd like to encourage
67:58 you guys to think about this theory and
68:01 apply it in your life is in as many
68:04 dimensions as possible don't let my
68:06 words be constraints to build a paradigm
68:09 where you are fixed and just a few
68:11 things now that's we're gonna start most
68:13 likely right the staring thing your
68:16 communication with your loved ones
68:17 perhaps your coworkers perhaps yourself
68:21 are you you know how many of you have
68:24 done this this happens to me from time
68:27 to time I can even I can have a
68:31 girlfriend at the time and we're just
68:34 not being real touchy with each other
68:36 for a week or so like she's working hard
68:38 I'm working hard and so we don't have a
68:39 lot of interaction and all sudden my
68:41 shoulders turned into rocks because
68:43 something stressed me out and I didn't
68:45 have any touch connection
68:47 II throw connection to diffuse my
68:50 frequency I don't have a trip to Havasu
68:52 plan so I can't just jump in the lake
68:54 and get it zeroed out
68:55 it used to be when I was a kid vacations
68:58 were almost a mandatory therapeutic
69:01 stage for the adults and the kids were
69:04 just like oh cool were in Hawaii but the
69:06 adults are going I need this and I need
69:08 this really bad and the parents don't
69:10 want to work they want to don't want to
69:12 sit in the Sun they want to go maybe
69:14 wade in the ocean they don't want to do
69:17 much like I'd only be burdened by
69:18 anything because being burdened to keep
69:20 a schedule and do a tourist [ __ ]
69:23 thing
69:23 that just it has more stress its
69:28 counteractive vacation how many times
69:30 you heard someone say I need a vacation
69:32 from my vacation that is usually someone
69:35 who goes on a guided tour vacation
69:38 they never had any freedom the entire
69:40 time Meli enjoyed seeing things they
69:43 never relaxed the knots they had in
69:45 their shoulders they got knots on top of
69:47 their knots now what do they need ether
69:51 Oh connection keep it in mind
69:55 I want us to be healthy all the way down
70:00 to our souls I think I'm telling you
70:03 something that is profoundly ignorant to
70:06 our predecessors I think if I were to be
70:11 able to speak like fluent Navajo or any
70:14 of the other Native American languages I
70:17 would be laughed out of the hut so yeah
70:22 well welcome to being alive this is how
70:24 we roll perhaps a guru from India would
70:28 know this a shaman from any culture in
70:30 the world would know this the Chinese
70:33 know this for sure why do they believe
70:35 in Qi what do they believe in massage
70:37 what do they think that you're in foot
70:39 gives off everything acupuncture the
70:44 Russians are really open-minded about
70:46 this they have Reiki clinics and massage
70:49 clinics and they have clinic so they
70:50 don't really massage you but they touch
70:51 you they connect with you and they're
70:53 straightening out your meridian lines
70:55 that's SuperDuper real okay the amount
70:59 of women I've taken out of utter stress
71:01 pockets just by lying them down and then
71:04 this voice talk to them get into their
71:06 issues make them forget it and just pull
71:10 it out of them and it's one for one it
71:13 works every single time every single
71:16 time so you might be in a capacity right
71:20 now in your life or you have someone you
71:21 love in your life perhaps it's your
71:22 child and you need to connect with them
71:28 if their little kid just put your hand
71:31 over their head you know honey I love
71:32 you
71:32 you let you know make the connection
71:34 stare right in their eyes that's why
71:36 it's important
71:37 it is a real connection your ether
71:40 connection and then here comes
71:42 information and as long as you really
71:44 love your child well they're gonna get
71:46 it so deep it'll be crazy you probably
71:48 don't even say any words but the words
71:49 won't hurt let me tell you maybe you
71:52 have a spouse that's just really really
71:54 stressed out and for whatever reason
71:56 even in your phone too much for your
71:59 you've drummed up your experience so
72:02 maybe you have your own stress but
72:03 you're like look maybe if I try to help
72:07 somebody else it'll help me who knows
72:11 you don't try you'll never know
72:14 hopefully you feel me on this one I want
72:17 you to understand this I want you to see
72:19 this because I think this is a massive
72:21 rebirth of an old concept I did the
72:25 Native Americans think about ether and
72:26 all that stuff no probably not but they
72:29 didn't have to do that you probably just
72:30 got it understood it so did a lot of
72:34 other cultures but now we're in this
72:36 modern age where we have blown so much
72:38 smoke up our own butts that we think we
72:41 just have humanity just figured out
72:45 we're doing silly things to try and fix
72:48 things sort of the simplest things to
72:52 erase problems forever but this is a
72:56 habitual thing you must develop it's
72:58 something that must become integrated
72:59 into your life if it's true this is a
73:02 daily thing this is a process this is a
73:05 methodology we have to connect we just
73:09 have to put down the Instagram the
73:13 Facebook you know Apple introduced
73:16 something which is determining how much
73:19 time you spend on their devices so you
73:22 go get a break every once in a while
73:23 that's pretty interesting pretty damn
73:26 interesting you know what about the
73:29 scientific reality that perhaps wireless
73:31 technology interferes with our ability
73:33 to connect even if we're spooning in bed
73:36 I don't think that's maybe the case but
73:39 probably you're sitting across from the
73:41 room it just annihilates all the
73:42 communication power in the room
73:47 the more powerful your internet
73:48 connection the more interrupted you are
73:51 the more 5g gets introduced whoo imagine
73:56 if 5 G's major health hazard is nothing
74:00 more than interrupting our ability to
74:04 communicate as human beings everywhere
74:06 we are we won't know it until we think
74:08 about a little bit more but
74:12 electromagnetic poles are what control
74:14 ether the most in the universe anyway I
74:20 think you feel me this is a little bonus
74:22 episode in the summer of 2019 today's
74:27 technically the fifth of July if you

75:36 website is - there's a search field
75:38 finally but you may not need the search
75:40 field unless you're going for a very
75:42 specific topic especially an old episode
75:45 you may have watched in the past but
75:47 there is a category list now if you're
75:49 on a phone you have to scroll past the
75:50 first ten videos and then it's down
75:52 below and you can go right for the kind
75:54 of videos that you like you want alien
75:56 conversations or in a little category
75:58 you get a little count to the right
