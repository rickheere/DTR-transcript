00:31 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen on this warm weekend afternoon
00:41 here I've got so many shows in the kion
00:43 even know what to do at this point today
00:45 we're gonna talk about what I'm gonna
00:46 call the tunnel of knowledge what is
00:50 that in my brain well this is the
00:53 counter theory in the counter name that
00:57 will fight this thing that is knowledge
01:00 being represented in your brain as a
01:02 destination there's a place that you
01:03 simply go to you sit down you cross your
01:06 legs
01:07 you say um and you know all the stuff
01:10 that you need to know the problem with
01:14 that theory is that it leaves you
01:15 ignorant as hell and we could use other
01:18 words but we'll just use the old h-bomb
01:21 where do we get this notion that that
01:25 education and knowledge and wisdom is
01:28 this destination well think about how
01:32 we're taught things as a child you got
01:35 to go to school you got to go to great
01:36 school did you got to go to med school
01:37 then you got to go to high school once
01:40 you get done with that you're gonna go
01:40 to college you're gonna get your degree
01:42 then you're gonna get your masters then
01:43 maybe you get a PhD all those things are
01:46 destinations you have plaques on the
01:48 wall that show you that that's a
01:50 destination now what's interesting is is
01:54 today you know kids get these some
01:58 schools give out like diplomas for the
02:00 transition between middle school and
02:02 high school which very different you
02:04 know different regions right and then
02:07 when you get your college degree you'll
02:09 look back on your your intermediate
02:12 degrees let's just put that your
02:13 diplomas like wow that was cute look at
02:16 me I'm in ninth grade look at me I'm a
02:18 senior in high school when I got my
02:19 diploma and but this is the big one
02:22 right here this is the big one my
02:24 college degree and then again you
02:27 advanced up depending on how you're
02:29 doing right the problem with thinking
02:32 that knowledge is a destination that
02:35 learning is the destination that wisdom
02:37 somehow caps out as you sell yourself
02:40 short of what you could truly be and it
02:43 will hinder by design your ability to
02:47 learn anything new
02:49 well I've cut a curry in this many times
02:53 you heard that for some [ __ ] blowhard
02:54 online well you know I don't see your
02:57 degree on the wall but bunny yes I can
03:00 see yours [ __ ] and it's like 40 years
03:02 old so unless you've been going to
03:04 refresh courses maybe you want to calm
03:07 down with your rhetoric right
03:09 the interesting thing about education in
03:12 a public forum is that it becomes a
03:13 competition I've seen this happen I
03:16 didn't grow up in this world because I
03:18 didn't go to college
03:19 in a way that most people go to college
03:22 right I went to just have fun and learn
03:25 things and I didn't worry about the
03:28 degree I was already doing what I wanted
03:30 to do for a living and I still do it but
03:33 I ingest nonfiction books like a lot of
03:37 people ingest fictional books and so I
03:40 prefer to learn something that can
03:42 attach to me and then I will go out and
03:44 live life to create the culture and the
03:46 experience and the creativity that I
03:47 need just by observing what is missing
03:51 now again I am losing out on a lot of
03:53 wonderful things and I'm hoping that in
03:56 my retirement years I can pick up a book
03:58 like my dad reads my dad reads like
04:01 libraries every year of books that are
04:04 fictional he loves it and I'm hoping at
04:07 some point that gene activates her right
04:08 now it's not activating for me not going
04:12 to college
04:13 broke the paradigm in the mold that I
04:16 have reached a point of finite education
04:20 it is the destination I've got it look
04:23 at me I don't need to do anything else
04:28 I'm gonna give you a weird analogy that
04:30 I see a lot in my hometown don't see so
04:33 much in the coastal regions because the
04:37 big city will kick your ass if you take
04:38 this attitude but when I go back to my
04:40 hometown I see people that are
04:43 absolutely wonderful human beings that
04:45 have sort of this identity as to who
04:47 they are I'm this guy I do this thing
04:49 I'm this woman I do this thing she's the
04:51 teacher she's the English teacher she
04:53 will always be the English teacher well
04:54 what grade does she teach seventh grade
04:59 okay so in my brain I'm thinking she
05:01 deals with seventh graders all day long
05:03 she's been doing that for 20 30 years
05:05 and so if I go have a conversation with
05:07 her I'm bet it's gonna feel like having
05:10 a conversational hybrid between an adult
05:13 and a seventh grader we have guys that
05:16 join the military and some got deployed
05:19 my age you the only thing you could have
05:21 really been deployed unless you went to
05:23 a twenty year track would be Desert
05:25 Storm and that was like a 48-hour war
05:27 for most mostly guys but they went over
05:30 there and and unfortunately got a bunch
05:33 of toxic anthrax shots that mysteriously
05:37 blew up in the Oklahoma Federal Building
05:40 all the investigations of that but they
05:43 will go to the parade and they will wear
05:45 their you know enlistment badges and the
05:47 fact that they did you know some
05:48 maneuvers and war and undeclared war of
05:51 course and it will have been probably
05:56 1995 when they went to their first
05:58 parade as this soldier but now it's 23
06:02 years later and they'll still go to that
06:04 parade and it they'll still talk about
06:06 it every single bar in ER you ever talk
06:09 to them every restaurant the war comes
06:11 up you know it was less than a week of
06:15 their life nobody got hurt in our forces
06:21 in that last couple days of deployment
06:23 which is where my friends were now they
06:26 suffer the slings and arrows of all the
06:27 vaccinations and weird immunization
06:30 stuff like I said a lot of the d-u we've
06:32 gotten to their bodies so why these guys
06:33 one of my friends died from it but we
06:37 hang on to these destination Allah
06:40 accomplishments and I've been in a world
06:43 where I can't hang on to my
06:45 accomplishments but I've done amazing
06:48 things I participated with other people
06:50 to do amazing things right now my
06:53 hometown just stick just to further this
06:56 analogy in your brain my I had a
06:58 relative that built a lot of homes in my
07:00 hometown and I don't know how many
07:01 dozens a few dozen made his entire
07:04 lifetime but we can drive down the
07:06 street and say uncle Ralph made that but
07:10 you know all the houses on this street
07:12 and they're all different right they're
07:14 not like track houses beautiful
07:16 masterpieces right his home is still
07:19 there the family's gone out of that
07:22 house but that house is like a wild
07:24 masterpiece in our hometown okay so what
07:28 he did lasted well beyond his years
07:30 right there's a lot of careers that do
07:34 that in the software business in the
07:37 video game business it is only what have
07:40 you done for me lately
07:41 that's it in the music business it
07:45 depends if you're Led Zeppelin it's the
07:48 gift that keeps giving if you're one-hit
07:51 wonder it's about a tenth of Led
07:54 Zeppelin experience but overall it's you
07:57 know you know this band and they created
07:59 great music and you own their album but
08:01 nobody knows that they exist you pull it
08:02 out and played it at a party and people
08:04 like yeah that's pretty good that put
08:05 loads up on right as an engineer for
08:10 many many years
08:12 31 years professionally I wonder if I
08:16 wonder how many of the lines of code
08:18 I've written still exist out there on
08:20 people's hard drives I wonder how much
08:23 of the artwork I've drawn for video
08:25 games for websites for promo materials I
08:29 mean all kinds of weird should have done
08:32 I wonder how many of my drawings still
08:34 exist out there it is my assumption that
08:37 it's near nothing simply because of the
08:41 attrition of the world Hardware doesn't
08:44 last long enough to hang on to the bits
08:46 right but I think it has to do with your
08:49 opinion of curiosity
08:52 if you find curiosity comforting then
08:57 your likelihood of thinking about
08:59 knowledge as a destination it probably
09:04 doesn't hold that true to you because
09:06 you're like ah I'm always curious about
09:08 something
09:08 I don't know everything I'm not I'm
09:11 gonna die not knowing much right I'll
09:14 know very little about the universe when
09:16 I die even if I know more than every
09:19 other human being on this planet I'm
09:21 still just a little puppy right
09:24 if curiosity scares you if the unknown
09:28 terrifies you
09:30 then you will hug the destination model
09:34 you won't be in a tunnel any more on
09:37 some cool amusement park ride you will
09:41 want to go to a back room and just sit
09:44 there maybe in the most illustrious
09:47 definition some Park right but in this
09:52 realm the what I'm talking about the
09:54 people want a hug a destination it's not
09:56 like Yosemite where there's a big
09:58 mountain over there and a bunch of stuff
09:59 you haven't looked at it and looked know
10:01 it is a industrial Fema camp park all
10:05 right there's the barbed wire fences
10:07 you're not allowed to have a
10:09 conversation over there because that'll
10:11 make me feel uncomfortable about myself
10:13 now there's a ton of definitions about
10:15 being old-fashioned and being modern
10:17 right you used to say you're a little
10:19 square cat you know if you if you
10:22 thought inside of a box and you're just
10:25 boring I come from a little hometown I'm
10:28 just ki keep talking about this because
10:29 I have relatives I have one relative of
10:32 mine who I think for whatever reason
10:37 when she was young
10:39 the alkylate came down from her parents
10:42 you are so smart and we're so proud of
10:46 you because you're smart smart smart
10:47 smart smart smart smart and so that
10:49 became her beacon of pleasing her
10:52 parents and once they stopped saying
10:55 that it became her internal beacon of
10:57 self-worth to be smart and before the
11:02 internet I think it was probably very
11:03 easy to get in a little
11:05 isolated quarantined area of the Midwest
11:08 don't move to the big city because you
11:10 will find out how much you don't know so
11:13 you stay in the little Midwestern
11:14 community keep your circle of friends
11:18 really small and you'll feel like a
11:19 goddamn genius every day of your life
11:21 right but then the internet happened and
11:25 it not only happens to the people that
11:28 are trying to live in this box but
11:30 happens to their family members live
11:31 around them and so I have I have like a
11:35 an annual circle with this person well
11:39 you know me you've seen this show I'm
11:42 hardly gonna sit around and go I know
11:43 everything I am done I am super smart
11:46 I've got the super smart plaque on my
11:47 wall finished you know at best I have a
11:54 frame on the wall with no picture the
11:57 intro of this show I film this table
12:03 this wrought iron table right and some
12:07 of you might be going why is he filming
12:08 that
12:09 it just seems okay it's his backyard
12:11 alright I see it it's kind of
12:13 interesting looking
12:15 this table is been in my family since
12:19 the 80s it was bought at some you know
12:22 place in Kansas where you buy your you
12:25 know we are furniture and it had a piece
12:27 of glass on it initially long gone
12:30 before it ever came to California so at
12:33 one point I had a piece of cardboard on
12:35 it you know like a nice thick not
12:37 cardboard but thick board on it that
12:39 disappeared it's out here in the back
12:41 the the chairs don't have the cushions
12:44 on them although I have them in the
12:45 garage
12:45 I just don't put them out here because
12:46 it rains but the most beautiful thing
12:50 about this in my mind it is a piece of
12:54 art and it is the destination of of what
13:01 we are because when people walk into my
13:05 backyard here's what I say they look at
13:07 that table and they're like what is that
13:08 I said that is the conversation table
13:13 they look at me really funny and I say
13:15 well if you pulled yourself up to this
13:18 table
13:19 that has no top what could you possibly
13:22 do but have a conversation so for me
13:26 that table happened serendipitously to
13:31 have no top but now it is it is what we
13:35 pull up and have deep thoughts at 2:00
13:39 in with the preposition I have friends
13:42 that work out every single day at gyms
13:44 they compete in competitions they win
13:49 and I look at their bodies and I think
13:52 wow that's pretty amazing man you guys
13:55 go to the gym all the time you live in
13:58 there I can ask you any questions about
14:00 the gym and man you just got it down and
14:02 I love that I love that they're amazing
14:04 in that physical way what we do on this
14:07 show is the mental version of what
14:09 they're doing at a competition of
14:11 physical competition we never stop
14:15 thinking do we now I've always been a
14:18 very curious guy as you could probably
14:20 imagine so before the show came out it
14:24 was you know I was always you know I
14:27 would do my work in life and then
14:30 something would boil up in me right I'd
14:32 go oh my god this is a piece of research
14:34 I just want to do I just get that river
14:36 of knowledge right there Phil okay dig
14:37 experience and I get my notebooks out
14:39 and I'd write 6 to 10 pages 20 pages by
14:42 hand of how to build a UFO and how I
14:45 think I can do this with this you know
14:48 Faraday fabric that I designed and dead
14:51 isn't that right ok when I started this
14:55 show I had no idea what the hell I was
14:57 doing right I mean you can see that in
14:59 season 1 but most of all the thing I
15:03 never paid attention to was the
15:08 difficulty that I was going to run into
15:10 coming up with new shows because I don't
15:13 have a partner in this show right so you
15:17 can when you have a partner in a show
15:18 like when I had em cable to radio I
15:20 could have a off day and tile would
15:23 carry me through the show and then he
15:25 would spawn ideas that I could react
15:27 from and so having a partnership is huge
15:31 why do you think coast-to-coast takes
15:32 calls
15:33 because it's a three-hour show that's
15:34 why I've routinely said on this show
15:37 that one that if you want to learn how
15:39 to communicate in your native language
15:41 or the language of your choice better
15:44 than you ever have in the past
15:46 you need to write poetry writing poetry
15:50 does a bunch of different things one you
15:53 have to have a feeling to write poetry
15:55 in the first place so if you have had a
15:57 really rough life and you're very hard
15:59 then you can start from that mindset if
16:02 I don't give a [ __ ] y'all could die I
16:05 don't care I'm a hit man whatever you
16:08 really hard poems and then as you feel
16:11 around inside your brain you'll read
16:15 your stuff back and maybe you'll go well
16:17 you know it's like I hate everybody you
16:19 know I like some people okay well what
16:21 is that some people that you like write
16:23 the next poem about that that little
16:25 mezzanine in your brain that's a little
16:27 less callous and hard and eventually
16:30 it's like pouring a bunch of filler
16:34 inside of a mold you think you're this
16:37 shape when you write poetry you fill up
16:40 the chamber with your true shape it's
16:42 like when they pour aluminum into
16:44 termite farms you know in the ground and
16:47 they pull this beautiful crazy thing up
16:49 out of the ground right poor termites
16:53 this show has been the mold it was been
16:56 sorry the filler for the mold of who the
16:58 hell I am and then when I've finally
17:00 realized I don't have a shape I mean I
17:04 might have a shape at a particular
17:06 second but I human being of a very
17:10 dynamic creature and you're human being
17:13 I think and you are the same way and so
17:18 it's an interesting new frontier that
17:22 you get to explore and this is why I
17:25 don't like organized paradigms of
17:28 thought religion what's religion do I'll
17:36 give you the extreme experience that
17:38 I've experienced in the comments section
17:40 although I will say
17:43 99.9% of everyone who's ever commented
17:46 on one of my videos from this
17:48 perspective has been absolutely kind and
17:51 generous with the difference of opinion
17:54 between the two of us so to all of you
17:56 who continue to listen and you do not
17:57 believe what I believe in a religious
18:00 sense I think unequivocally you're the
18:04 bigger man you're the bigger woman you
18:08 you've shown your patience on a level
18:12 that's very godly I believe in God I
18:16 just don't believe in any organized
18:17 religion being true true as in factually
18:20 historically true not denying the truth
18:24 of the wisdom that's inside religions
18:26 that's the beautiful part about it but I
18:30 have seen in my lifetime people damn
18:33 people to hell you know if you don't do
18:36 this man a lot of times people I cut
18:38 myself off sometimes people come
18:40 straight up to your face to tell you're
18:41 going to hell I have a cousin she used
18:43 to do that she lost all of her friends
18:46 and all of her family connections and
18:47 then she backed off a little bit but the
18:50 backhanded way they do it is that they
18:52 they know that you do something let's
18:54 just say let's say you're sipping a
18:56 little bit of wine something Jesus
18:57 turned water into water turned water
19:00 into but you sip wine and you know these
19:05 Neanderthal brains right they'll go well
19:08 you know if you drink one you'll go to
19:10 hell
19:10 so without telling you directly to your
19:12 face you're going to hell but they'll
19:14 say something around you that is
19:17 basically telling you you're going to
19:19 hell damning someone Wow that's some
19:24 that's some judge and jury right there
19:26 they are the executioner at the end of
19:29 the sentence whoof one of the most
19:32 interesting passages in the Bible and
19:34 the Christian Bible and I can't remember
19:37 exactly where it is but there's a
19:38 passage in there that says at least in
19:40 one translation never call another man a
19:44 fool and when I heard that it really
19:53 struck me cuz it was such a simple
19:55 phrase
19:56 and I was like wow well I don't use the
19:59 word fool I don't know too many people
20:01 who do I've used it more as an adult
20:03 because I think it's the the
20:06 complexities and the subtleties of the
20:07 word fool are very interesting it's a
20:11 very simple word right fool means you're
20:14 ignorant and you're stupid
20:16 maybe it's more your stupid than your
20:17 ignorance but why would that why would
20:21 anyone have written that down ever in
20:23 time we know there's people that are
20:25 ignorant they haven't been educated
20:26 about something we usually write a blank
20:29 check for ignorant children they just
20:31 don't know any better right they why do
20:34 you learn that fires hot hey man you can
20:36 tell the kid fires hot all you want they
20:38 got to touch something and they got to
20:39 burn themselves that's what my dad did
20:41 right I asked my father at a Mexican
20:43 restaurant and they used to serve those
20:45 super hot metal plates inside of a black
20:48 ceramic plate and I said is it hot and
20:53 he was touch it
20:55 Shh and I mean it burn blistered the
20:58 bottom of my finger that's probably
21:00 three or four years old and of course I
21:02 cried and he laughed his head off and
21:04 everyone else was like Chuck you're the
21:06 worst father ever
21:07 and honestly no he was the perfect dad
21:12 in that sense he was perfect it's
21:14 exactly what I needed to do he knew it
21:16 wasn't gonna kill me he knew I would
21:18 heal the house am I gonna learn later I
21:22 touched a soldering iron got a little
21:24 reminder did that one all by myself so
21:29 how do you live your life if you've been
21:30 living it as a destination constantly
21:33 well what do you do a lot of you will
21:36 just simply go yeah man we watch your
21:37 show or listen to your show because
21:39 we're not like that good excellent
21:43 now you know that the second you turn
21:46 this show off you turn around to the
21:49 world you start having conversations
21:51 with people you're going to run into
21:53 people probably three out of four at
21:55 least you know the Great Awakening of
21:57 2018 is definitely widening our gap of
22:00 people that are willing to express a
22:03 little bit of humiliation right but
22:06 people want to essentially say they made
22:09 it to assert
22:10 alkalete I graduated high school you
22:13 know there's a lot of people haven't
22:14 graduated high school you just don't
22:17 know it there are some people that can't
22:19 read and you just don't know it was an
22:21 article out recently a guy was a teacher
22:23 I think he's like a history teacher or
22:27 something or but he didn't know how to
22:29 read for the first 17 years he was a
22:32 teacher I think it was probably great
22:34 school isn't that amazing
22:36 how do you fill out a employment
22:39 application how did he read his students
22:43 tests to see if they passed or not was
22:46 it all multiple choice for Christ's sake
22:48 probably with common core right if you
22:51 took away all the paradigm of society
22:53 and let's just say we luck out and
22:57 everyone's still nice to each other
22:58 there's not going to be law of the
23:01 jungle we would live very organic lives
23:06 you would get up and you'd probably do a
23:08 survival routine get your water get your
23:10 food take care of your family well let's
23:16 just say that only takes a couple hours
23:17 a day at the beginning couple hours a
23:19 day at night maybe a little bit in one
23:23 hour in the afternoon that leaves a lot
23:24 of time to do something else all right
23:29 but you've had those righteous people
23:31 come up to you haven't you
23:34 especially in religion they will damn
23:36 you they will tell you that they have it
23:38 figured out and you can look into their
23:39 face and you'll see two things you'll
23:43 see a low IQ and you will see the Glee
23:47 of their superiority over you for the
23:53 paradigm that they're coming to you with
23:55 right it's almost as if the most
23:58 euphoric thing for some people when they
24:00 read the Bible is oh my gosh I am now a
24:05 traffic cop and I get to walk around now
24:09 and damn everybody straight to [ __ ]
24:11 hell and that's the most exciting
24:13 pastime that they have because before
24:15 that they didn't have a purpose this
24:19 [ __ ] of global warming and climate
24:21 change
24:23 it it takes the average numbskull from
24:27 being in their mind perhaps useless to
24:30 overall society which is obviously not
24:33 true it's something that they feared to
24:35 be true they latch on to this purpose
24:37 and they run around posting online and
24:40 blogging and carrying the [ __ ] piece of
24:44 the globalists who want every single one
24:48 of us dead go check out the Georgia
24:52 Guidestones for [ __ ] sake right for
24:55 those of you don't know about the
24:56 Georgia Guidestones I bring it up every
24:58 once in a while because it's it's hard
25:00 to do a whole episode on it but someone
25:03 built this in the early 80s in Georgia
25:06 the state of Georgia in America and it
25:10 has these Ten Commandments on several
25:13 sides of these stones all written in
25:15 different languages and then there's
25:16 plaques on the ground is translated into
25:18 more languages it's like almost 30
25:19 languages but the first commandment is
25:22 maintain world population under 500
25:25 million in perpetual balance with nature
25:29 those of you are extremely bad at math
25:31 if you divide a number a limited number
25:35 by the total quantity of the number so
25:37 you do 500 million divided by 7.5
25:40 billion you have a 98% reduction in
25:44 world population and as I always remind
25:48 you on this show when I mention the
25:49 subject no one builds a restaurant at
25:52 capacity of 500 and wants 500 people to
25:55 show up every single day it's too much
25:57 if they thought of 500 people were going
25:59 to show up every single day they build a
26:01 restaurant that could hold a thousand so
26:04 there'd be some room left right so they
26:06 could have a swell during a holiday
26:10 Mother's Day breakfast or whatever and
26:12 then it goes back down to some space
26:15 they will not start off the population
26:18 at the maximum apex they will start it
26:20 off at probably a hundred and fifty
26:23 million people that's what I'm I'm
26:26 guesstimating less than half that gives
26:28 them centuries and perhaps millennia to
26:31 repopulate back up to a billion but
26:34 they'll control all the access to enter
26:36 and birth control and everything and
26:38 they probably will never hit 500 million
26:40 and 150 million is 99.9% of the
26:45 population missing so when these people
26:48 attach themselves to these definitions
26:51 of intelligence and they run around
26:54 damming the universe you couldn't walk
26:59 any closer in my opinion to pure
27:04 foolishness and pure evil
27:08 than to be that ignorant right
27:10 foolishness leads to this this other
27:13 behavior
27:14 now you'll talk to some people I've
27:17 definitely had this conversation is it
27:18 funny how when isolab will just
27:20 disappears from a word because I'm
27:21 moving my mouth you'll talk to some
27:25 people and they will be very existential
27:29 and they'll say things like I'm on a
27:32 journey and when I die this particular
27:36 journey of being a humanoid is over and
27:40 I transcend to the next level of
27:42 consciousness the other form of
27:43 consciousness and we'll see what that
27:45 journey has to do Prince he always
27:48 talked about in the movie in the
27:50 starting the song let's go crazy he
27:53 talks about how it's gonna be in the
27:54 afterlife and he says you know his
27:58 general consensus was you're gonna get a
28:00 little help in the afterlife but in this
28:01 one you're on your own we could hope
28:05 he's right I think a child can sense
28:07 when their parent believes in these
28:09 destination --all paradigms of knowledge
28:12 because of what happens what's the
28:15 difference between a child and an
28:17 average parent I assume most of you and
28:21 I'm not bullshitting you I assume most
28:23 of you if your parents you're above
28:25 average parent if you're watching this
28:26 show you just are if you haven't had
28:28 your kids it you're going to be an above
28:31 average parent but let me make you hip
28:34 the one thing in case you're in the
28:35 middle of this or you're thinking about
28:37 getting into it your child from the
28:40 moment they are born and I mean the
28:41 second their eyes open out of that
28:43 uterus they are on a journey
28:47 for the first couple years they are
28:50 sucking in everything and trying to find
28:52 out what will get them in trouble what
28:54 will fill their belly where to sleep
28:56 we're not to sleep how to get love out
28:59 of every person who comes in contact
29:01 with them and when they throw tantrums
29:04 and you'll wonder but the parent is what
29:08 depending on the age of the parent they
29:11 are looking for destinations of
29:12 completeness I know how to make money I
29:15 have a skill I get a job and I stay
29:18 there and I keep the skill really sharp
29:21 and I make the money and I bring it home
29:24 to my kid and they get to have what they
29:25 need the older you are the more you're
29:28 stuck in your ways right that's what
29:30 they say so you're more in a destination
29:32 aloof usually as an older person but
29:36 your kid your kid isn't your kid is on a
29:40 major journey if you're a parent that
29:43 can only listen to your own music from
29:45 your own age right you only listen to
29:47 80s music this is what happens with kids
29:51 that are my age
29:52 Gen X they're either stuck in the 80s or
29:55 they're stuck in the 90s a great song
30:00 can come out today and they simply won't
30:03 listen to it to give it a chance
30:05 obviously music has changed most of us
30:08 would say okay if the kid can play his
30:10 own instrument sing without a auto-tune
30:13 I'll give it a chance and I'll give you
30:15 that exception because I'm the same way
30:16 there is there are great songs that are
30:19 made every single day that are real
30:20 bands that really play they aren't
30:23 getting all the TMZ traffic because that
30:26 [ __ ] is swill usually but your kid needs
30:28 for you to be on an inquisitive journey
30:32 with them they're rediscovering a lot of
30:35 stuff that you discovered as a kid a lot
30:37 of times parents will minimize it oh
30:39 yeah you're gonna find out this you're
30:40 gonna find out that I already been there
30:42 and you're throwing your alkylate in
30:44 their face I've already been there you
30:46 don't know anything
30:47 boom pop boom I was raised by one of
30:49 these parents and it wasn't intentional
30:52 and in most cases it wasn't intentional
30:54 it was just trying to remind me that
30:57 there is much more to learn which is an
31:00 interesting less
31:02 it can have weird side effects
31:06 now I've rarely shared this kind of
31:09 stuff on the show you have only one
31:11 other show but I'm gonna throw it back
31:12 in there because I think it's it's
31:14 valuable as a parent for you to
31:16 understand the side effects of some of
31:17 the things that you can say now most of
31:20 us over 25 especially those of us in our
31:23 40s will simply go man you really don't
31:25 know anything
31:26 you really don't really start learning
31:28 anything material in life social level
31:31 until you're about 25 years old that's
31:33 when you sort of slow down a little bit
31:34 and I don't even know if that's true
31:36 anymore definitely was the case for me
31:39 and so you'll hear people say you don't
31:41 know anything at 18 you don't know
31:42 anything at 22 now some kids grow up a
31:45 lot faster than others but I think
31:46 that's overall very very true but we say
31:49 it in a way that's belittling instead of
31:51 saying in a way that's exciting and so
31:56 you know my experience with girls as a
31:59 young man was very interesting and it
32:01 took me a while to really recall this in
32:04 my brain to realize who was the
32:06 aggressor it was interesting you know my
32:09 first I guess you could say sexual thing
32:13 that ever happened to me it was a girl
32:15 they're always usually girls my age was
32:18 five years old five years old I was
32:21 doing things with a neighbor girl
32:24 we just mutually I guess just accept
32:26 that we're gonna and we just played
32:28 around right wouldn't do anything
32:29 massive two years later it went to a
32:32 much higher level but another girl who
32:34 was even younger than younger than me at
32:35 the time probably say you're younger
32:38 than me and she was just like let's do
32:40 this let's do that I'm seven years old I
32:42 think she was six I turned eight fairly
32:45 quickly so she must have turned seven
32:47 but that's SuperDuper young man so I had
32:50 all this these experiences I got some
32:52 peer pressure you know light stuff like
32:55 I said you know the neighbor kids said
32:57 you need to french kiss your girlfriend
32:58 oh just regular kiss her and everyone's
33:00 watching and we do it you know but when
33:04 I got my teens I moved in with my dad
33:07 and you know we'd have the dad
33:10 conversation my dad was really cool he
33:12 still is but back in those days
33:15 he was the coolest freaking dad you
33:17 could ever have I mean seriously
33:18 hence my cool vibe today and he had
33:22 friends that were even cooler than him
33:23 it's awesome and so we had just a really
33:25 good network of guys like men around me
33:29 like burly dudes that you know just pull
33:33 their station wagon and up into our
33:34 garage and just start tearing the engine
33:37 apart and repairing and I'm sinners
33:39 looking at all this crazy stuff and
33:40 asking a million questions that was kind
33:42 enough to explain to me what's what's
33:44 what there came a point when I got into
33:48 the second stage of girls where I was
33:50 the aggressor I was the one that wanted
33:52 to have the relationship and go steady
33:54 as they say and there was a point where
33:57 my dad I think he didn't mean it the way
33:59 that it came out but he said you know
34:02 you still don't know what it's really
34:05 about in so many ways but he said a
34:07 little more flip it and a little more
34:09 sort of demeaning and I don't use that
34:12 word too strongly because it wasn't
34:13 really like you know you don't know
34:15 nothing kid it wasn't like that but it
34:17 was some flavor of that right well then
34:21 what became what was my paradigm of
34:23 exploration of girls became this thing
34:26 of oh he's saying that with a sort of
34:30 overtone I may have misunderstood him
34:33 but I took it as I need to do this
34:36 because in order to get his respect I
34:39 need to bring back of the boon of full
34:43 knowledge of a girl's body I need to
34:46 have sex with them and so in my
34:50 mid-teens by phone of she phone of her
34:54 first time my first time boom we did it
34:58 it was beautiful I was very very
35:00 fortunate to have a beautiful first
35:01 experience and has never not been
35:05 beautiful it ended beautiful I mean the
35:07 whole thing's been good okay so then my
35:10 dad and I are fixing VCRs it's because
35:13 it was one of our pastimes to make money
35:15 just to have fun and I'm just working on
35:17 this VCR and he's got one over there and
35:19 he's doing his thing and the subject
35:21 comes up about girls and he says it
35:25 again well you don't know nothing you
35:26 know something like that I can't
35:28 it was you don't know the whole game or
35:29 whatever the hell he said and I turned
35:31 him and I said I said something to the
35:34 effect of well what if I told you I I
35:37 I'm a couple weeks into knowing that
35:41 other side meaning I've been having sex
35:43 for a couple weeks and my dad was like
35:47 what and he just you know he does
35:50 version of turning white and it was like
35:52 okay you're not gonna get a girl knocked
35:55 up at fifteen years old
35:57 let's go to the drugstore my dad takes
36:00 me to drugstore he's like you're gonna
36:02 buy this this and this he goes that
36:04 sucks that sucks you got a lot of he
36:06 says you have a lot of classmates
36:07 because of this it was showing me
36:09 various things that won't go into
36:10 details but he's sent me home with what
36:13 I needed to keep everything cool you
36:16 know and so it my dad was good because
36:22 he was young and even though he was
36:24 older than me obviously he was 23 years
36:26 older than me he is still is this day he
36:29 had a very young spirit super young
36:31 spirit to this day is very young in
36:33 spirit which is great I didn't know how
36:36 that able that was until I grew up and I
36:41 ran into adults that were very stoic and
36:44 very destination knowledge oriented life
36:47 wasn't a journey for them life was a
36:49 destination what happens if you adopt
36:53 the destination but you don't have a bad
36:56 life because this happens every single
36:59 day little hometowns are full of these
37:01 people they don't have the big city to
37:03 continually entertain them they don't
37:05 have the big city to offer them you know
37:08 dozens and dozens of different job types
37:10 and so there's only you know a couple
37:12 jobs in town you either work for the
37:13 city you work for Walmart you pump gas I
37:16 mean it was like a few things a couple
37:17 factories in the towns next door they
37:20 can't set their expectations too high in
37:24 that particular realm because then
37:26 they'll disappoint themselves I mean
37:28 there's nothing to do I got to move away
37:30 from my hometown which means lose all my
37:31 friends there's all my family I lose the
37:34 land that I love that's one thing we
37:37 always forget when we move away
37:39 there's a great benefit to a really
37:42 strong foundation for a human being
37:45 what's interesting in my experience
37:48 having come from largely the Midwest of
37:50 Kansas / America is that when I got to
37:55 California I realized subliminally that
38:00 I had this great work ethic I had a
38:02 really strong knowledge base of
38:04 everything that I loved because I was
38:05 left alone in the Midwest to focus right
38:08 not a lot of distractions I didn't have
38:10 a beach I didn't have Disneyland I
38:12 didn't have Hollywood Universal Studios
38:15 and you know stuff
38:16 I focused I made do when I got to
38:21 California I met a lot of people that
38:23 had lived the other life constantly
38:26 entertained by their surroundings
38:27 there's nothing wrong with that but what
38:29 it what it left him with was when they
38:32 needed to become a worker bee they
38:36 really struggled with their work ethic
38:39 because focusing was not something that
38:42 they natively did in this super
38:45 entertaining world the other compliment
38:48 I get in California from time to time
38:51 which always surprises me it pleases me
38:54 but it surprises me is someone will be
38:58 talking to me sometimes I hear this
39:00 third person or third third party
39:02 through through a proxy right for
39:05 instance I had a girl that I became
39:07 friends with and eventually I met her
39:09 husband at a restaurant and I'm just
39:12 talking to him you know and then later
39:14 she chatted me through Facebook or
39:16 something and my husband she goes my
39:17 husband said he's a really he's just a
39:21 really great guy and he's really honest
39:23 he's really just one of those guys and
39:26 where I come from no one would ever say
39:29 that they would just expect you to be
39:30 that way but in the big city it's a
39:33 distinction Mike Wow it seems like he's
39:36 the kind of guy I would always tell the
39:38 truth
39:38 wow if you're like yeah I guess there is
39:43 another way to be sheisty manipulative
39:47 right and I have to say of all the
39:50 people I've befriended in California
39:52 I seem to have a means of finding people
39:55 that are very honest and wonderful human
39:58 beings so there's not a huge lack of
40:02 supply of these individuals but it
40:04 doesn't take much effort to find the
40:05 sheisty guy
40:06 the sheisty girl most of them are guys
40:08 that I know when you become an engineer
40:12 something very interesting happens
40:15 depending on what kind of engineer you
40:16 become if you become a software engineer
40:20 then there is no destination in your
40:24 life unless you work for the government
40:26 where you can sit there with a 10 year
40:28 job not 10 years but tenure and you can
40:35 become a fossil and I'll keep paying you
40:38 until you die and get your retirement
40:40 right if you work in a competitive
40:43 corporate world and let's say that you
40:46 were a I don't know like in my
40:49 experience geez we used to program in
40:51 Pascal no one does that anymore
40:52 used to program in C now it's C++ you
40:55 still have C++ but you then have to have
40:57 the platform language either Microsoft
41:00 Windows languages or Macintosh mobile
41:03 languages regularly you know we have
41:05 Swift now as a brand-new language it
41:06 comes out everything renews constantly
41:08 so you're never able to settle down in
41:11 your brain with this destination
41:12 knowledge technique when you make video
41:15 games well when I started doing video
41:18 games that was text-based video games
41:20 like Zork then we went up to art based
41:23 video games we drew them in tiles for a
41:26 long time then things went 3d and now
41:29 it's 3d models well then 3d models went
41:31 through all kinds of evolution right
41:32 yeah it looks fake what else where else
41:34 we gonna do it's a PlayStation 1 we're
41:37 doing our best and now with PlayStation
41:39 4 it's like is this real or is this a
41:42 game you know when the PlayStation 2
41:44 came out I've said the story a couple
41:46 times
41:46 put Madden football worked for EA yeah I
41:49 got free copies of everything I put
41:50 Madden football on my tv downstairs 60
41:52 inch screen rear projection and I made
41:55 the AI play itself and I had the mother
42:00 of my child come in as a big sports fan
42:01 and she looked at this thing and she's
42:03 watching the game and she finally came
42:06 up after about five minutes upstairs
42:08 where I was getting my kids stuff ready
42:10 and she goes is this is this on TV right
42:14 now I looked at her I said that's a
42:17 video game her I just watched her face
42:21 yo oh I thought that was strange he
42:26 didn't really occur to her that she was
42:27 just convinced that a video game was
42:29 real that was 18 years ago people all
42:33 right so there's certain careers that
42:36 will perpetuate the destination model
42:40 and there are certain careers that will
42:41 perpetuate the tunnel model the tunnel
42:43 is who stays in tunnels
42:45 nobody you always go in and you always
42:47 come out you're always moving in a
42:49 tunnel if you have your way right but
42:52 how how does a destination model sink
42:56 its claws into you well in religion you
43:02 can be a casual Sunday morning Christian
43:04 and you don't walk around exuding
43:07 Christianity pat you know what you won't
43:09 quote passages out of the Bible and tell
43:12 people they're going to hell
43:14 usually but then you have your sort of
43:17 next-level religious person where they
43:18 get into Bible studies they go to church
43:20 three times a week and set it one time a
43:22 week and they're a little bit more
43:24 friendly in there they live a usually
43:26 they live more by the example because
43:28 they're ingesting it so much you know
43:30 whatever you take into your brain is
43:31 what you become right as long as you're
43:34 not into the hell and damnation part of
43:36 the Bible and trying to cast judgment on
43:39 others you're simply going to become
43:40 more christ-like
43:41 which I can't think of a better thing
43:43 for you to do but you go to that third
43:46 tier where you become fanatical and this
43:50 is where you think you should go down to
43:52 the local Main Street with a bullhorn
43:56 and some painted signs and tell everyone
43:59 the world's gonna end cuz you finally
44:01 read revelations and you look around the
44:03 world and you realize that metaphor is
44:05 everywhere and you'll start telling all
44:08 your local friends well I think the
44:09 second comings come and look at what the
44:11 Bible says look what the globalists are
44:13 doing not realizing that every
44:16 generation before you has said exactly
44:18 the same thing
44:19 that that these hell and damnation
44:21 revelation passages have always been so
44:24 metaphorical and so symbolic that you
44:27 can always find that in society since
44:32 the utter pounding into the
44:35 consciousness of man through the
44:36 Inquisition's of Europe which is
44:38 essentially a way of saying forcing
44:40 people to believe something they didn't
44:42 believe with no evidence we have had
44:46 people thinking that the world was going
44:48 to end every day the world is existed
44:51 and there's two sides to that world is
44:54 going to end coin you have your more on
44:56 point person who is saying the world is
44:58 going to end and they believe that once
45:00 they believe that's going to happen they
45:01 believe it's gonna happen really soon
45:03 what do you do with your life you
45:06 continue exploring life [ __ ] no you sit
45:09 around bracing for impact
45:12 and then you have a non-religious
45:16 version of the same exact thing which is
45:18 you have someone who has grown very
45:19 cynical about life they had a lot of
45:22 dreams which is a beautiful thing but
45:24 for whatever reason you know you have a
45:27 lot of dreams but there's only so many
45:28 days in the year so many hours in the
45:30 day that you can study anything focus
45:33 there's opportunities you need to run
45:34 into you have children you know life
45:37 gets gets busy and some people can look
45:41 at their life and go geez I really wish
45:43 I'd done that and so they feel like they
45:47 have been pushed into a destination that
45:49 they didn't really they didn't really
45:50 want and so they begin to sort of grind
45:55 out every single day right they hear
46:00 about dying in and the and I think every
46:04 adult has had this experience I don't
46:06 think that any one's immune from this
46:08 some people fear death on a level that's
46:10 like nuts in my opinion but if if you
46:13 have some model for the afterlife I
46:15 think whether it be religious or some
46:17 sort of I have totally no problem with
46:19 ceasing to exist or whatever the case
46:21 might be death will be presented to you
46:25 know you get on a plane and you'll be
46:27 like oh god this thing can fall out of
46:28 the sky and most people will probably
46:31 say I don't
46:32 want that to happen but I think at some
46:34 point in your life there'll be that trip
46:36 where you kind of go well if it's my
46:38 time to punch out I'm gonna punch out
46:40 and in this these taxes that I have this
46:43 this job that I may or may not like all
46:47 the burdens of life my aching back or
46:49 whatever well at least all that'll go
46:51 away and so they create this sort of
46:54 image of their life I mean if you create
46:57 a gestalt in your brain right a full
46:59 image of your life and you believe that
47:03 there are locks on every door in fact
47:06 there may not even be any doors
47:08 they've been welded shut they have been
47:11 removed from the wall and you're at a
47:14 destination you might give up on the
47:19 journey you're in the tunnel and you
47:22 just sit down cross your legs and go
47:24 well this is where we are I think it's
47:28 important that you think this sort of
47:29 thing through so that you have a little
47:31 more weaponry - or energy to keep going
47:35 to knock down the obstacles that are in
47:37 the way that are giving you this idea
47:39 that you're in some state that can't be
47:43 changed a guy from my hometown just I
47:48 don't know if he's still going I
47:51 deactivated the Facebook page in which I
47:53 saw his feed but he was married for 25
47:56 years had two beautiful children and
48:00 after 25 years his wife finally decided
48:04 to fall in love with someone else
48:06 and divorce him and where most of us
48:10 might keep this fairly private yeah this
48:13 guy exhibition his life his
48:15 consciousness into gigantic posts on
48:18 Facebook he was smart enough not to call
48:21 his wife a bunch of names but he was
48:22 definitely talking about things using
48:25 very you know poignant language let's
48:28 just put that way and what ended up
48:31 happening was the rest of the town
48:32 because we're a small little town and we
48:34 care about everyone started talking in
48:35 the back channels oh my god have you
48:37 seen so-and-so's posts oh my god he's
48:39 really just out there can you believe
48:40 he's posting this kind of stuff now
48:42 obviously if you're a psychologist or
48:44 you're sensitive these kind of things
48:45 you'll know
48:45 that he was essentially going through a
48:48 public exhibition of his own therapy I
48:51 still would not recommend it but it
48:54 worked for him and he thought his life
48:56 was about over right but I could see he
48:58 was in a perspective he was giving up on
49:02 the journey for a short bit I know that
49:04 as long as he stays alive life will
49:07 change life will get better as long as
49:11 he stays in the public eye he'll meet
49:13 another woman who thinks he's the
49:15 greatest thing on planet Earth he'll
49:17 remarry or at least get a partner
49:19 probably won't die alone and all this
49:22 hurt that his love that he lost which he
49:26 probably lost long before he realized he
49:28 lost it obviously it'll go away
49:32 but as much as I ignored his feed I kept
49:35 getting back channel communications from
49:37 people about this and so I started
49:39 looking at his feed and no reading his
49:42 posts you know it's not that I don't
49:43 care about the guy I don't really know
49:45 him personally I knew his brother really
49:46 really well his brother passed was my
49:49 age but I eventually figured out what to
49:52 say at least one thing I thought might
49:56 be a little helpful in terms of
49:57 perspective for him
49:58 and so I asked him a question I said how
50:01 long were you married
50:02 he said 25 years I said okay so in 25
50:09 years you were married to a woman that
50:11 you loved dearly you had two beautiful
50:14 children you've celebrated in your posts
50:17 among all these other acidic posts that
50:20 you put up there so I did a little bit
50:22 of math on my own end
50:23 and I said look in your 25 year journey
50:26 I said I have tried to marry eight
50:29 different women and it didn't work out I
50:33 tried I don't get in relationships with
50:36 people just to have fun I get in
50:37 relationships to go the full distance
50:39 but something will happen not the right
50:42 timing you know that's just something
50:44 will happen so I said you have succeeded
50:48 where I have failed for 25 years I'd say
50:53 you're pretty fortunate and guess what
50:56 you're not done yet right you're not
50:59 you're alive you're very alive these
51:02 posts are testament to his complete
51:06 consciousness and it seemed like a bit
51:12 of his acidic nature the volume of his
51:15 posts seemed to calm down just a teeny
51:18 bit after I think maybe he had a second
51:20 to think about that he still went on
51:23 post of things but he was thinking about
51:26 his life having reached the destination
51:27 and of course when you get married you
51:30 want to think about it in a destination
51:31 older knee but the problem that he
51:34 admitted in his posts was that he
51:36 treated his marriage like a destination
51:38 what do we call that you take your life
51:42 for granted you take your wife for
51:46 granted and when you do that you may pay
51:51 the consequence that he paid how many
51:55 people have you known they have lost
51:56 their jobs and they'll call you up and
51:58 say oh my god I just got laid off I just
52:00 got fired whatever and you can hear it
52:03 in their voice they for at least a short
52:06 time will feel hopeless about their
52:10 situation and you're trying to convince
52:13 them hey man it's okay it's alright
52:15 you'll find out the job of course is
52:17 obviously easy for you to say that
52:18 because you probably have a job at the
52:20 time even if you don't have a job you're
52:23 like welcome to the club now let's both
52:25 combine efforts on daily basis let's
52:28 check in with each other and feel each
52:30 other's positivity to get a new job let
52:34 me ask you this it's your body does your
52:39 body consider itself a destination when
52:42 you were born did you stay a baby when
52:46 you had your 16th birthday did you stay
52:48 16 years old you know I'm going with
52:52 that right
52:52 your body is an organic living being you
52:56 know that the doctors tell us the
52:57 scientist says that every seven years
52:59 every cell in our body has completely
53:02 renewed so if you look at that picture
53:04 of yourself 10 years ago every cell in
53:08 that and that photograph is dead long
53:11 gone in fact your epidermis problem
53:12 we'll hear enews even faster but your
53:14 eyeballs have renewed your hair is
53:16 renewed everything you live in a world
53:20 that isn't a destination all around you
53:22 the climate does change it's a normal
53:25 thing the earth does grow coastlines
53:29 fall into the ocean every once in a
53:31 while new coastlines are born go look at
53:34 Hawaii they're you know the volcano is
53:36 building a new island slowly but surely
53:38 would you play a video game if you could
53:43 easily finish it and then every time you
53:46 load up the game it's the same level
53:48 every single time effect if you play
53:51 Tetris for instance the same block
53:54 pieces fall every single time in the
53:56 same exact order you've learned exactly
53:58 how to place it to the point where you
54:00 can play nearly infinitely I can tell
54:05 you for a fact you wouldn't play that
54:06 game very far kids I've talked about
54:09 this before when you play a video game
54:10 and you you go into god mode you find a
54:13 little secret code where you have all
54:15 the ammunition and you're immune and you
54:17 just kill everything in the game you're
54:19 done playing that game in about 15 to 20
54:22 minutes and you no longer look at the
54:25 real game with any interest so if you
54:29 try to go back in without god mode
54:30 you're like this is hard I tasted what
54:33 it was like to have no obstacles I don't
54:36 think I like this thing with obstacles
54:37 how many times have you known parents
54:40 that over coddled their children and
54:41 when their children entered the real
54:43 world it was hard they dropped out of
54:47 college because that requires focus they
54:51 had to get themselves up in the morning
54:52 and go to class because it's not a law
54:55 that you have to go to college and so
54:57 they dropped out for people like myself
54:59 Steve Jobs probably even Bill Gates and
55:04 a ton of other people we went to college
55:07 it was fun it was cool I really
55:09 celebrate the classes that I took they
55:11 changed my life but it wasn't fast
55:14 enough
55:14 I was hindered by the people in the
55:19 class that didn't know something so I
55:21 had to take a prerequisite to get to the
55:23 class that had the first
55:26 information that I didn't know in the
55:29 end I'm like well you know what I'm just
55:30 gonna buy a book I'm just gonna buy a
55:32 book I'm gonna go straight for what I
55:34 don't know instead of sitting in this
55:35 class for six months paying money for
55:38 this experience but I can just go learn
55:40 what I need to learn and with YouTube
55:41 out there today my god there's a YouTube
55:45 video for every single thing you could
55:47 ever want to be an expert at and they
55:49 will show you shortcuts they will show
55:52 you way to be a beginner and
55:54 intermediate and an expert what has been
55:57 the commodity of the world for probably
55:59 the last I don't know 20 years I believe
56:03 that one of the strongest commodity
56:05 types is anything that serves the short
56:07 attention span Michael Bay is an expert
56:10 director at short attention span
56:12 directing he's made a tremendous amount
56:15 of money and he is the master of that
56:17 direction style there's an I don't know
56:20 anyone that can direct better than him
56:21 the short attention span but from all
56:25 the jins' ease and the Millennials that
56:27 I have bumped into I guess they're gen
56:31 wise I'm seeing that pattern end slowly
56:38 I'm seeing kids turn on old movies like
56:42 from the 30s and the 40s they're
56:46 starting to see what depth feels like
56:48 and it feels good to their soul a lot of
56:52 them will more in the fact that that
56:54 kind of stuff isn't created today again
56:57 I get I get every once in a while you
57:01 know mostly it's my closest friends that
57:02 I mentioned this a couple times recently
57:04 but I get a lot of flack for making
57:05 episodes that are an hour or more you
57:09 know man if you made 15 minute episodes
57:11 you'd have like a million subscribers
57:12 I'm like well those aren't the
57:14 subscribers that I'm compatible with so
57:17 why would I want a whole trough of
57:19 people coming to me every day to give
57:21 them something that I don't want to give
57:22 them I don't even give them myself if I
57:25 have a choice it is my firm belief from
57:28 my own personal experience with my own
57:30 family members that tend to engage in
57:31 this destination of thinking that
57:35 they aren't that intelligent they aren't
57:39 that intelligent as I always tell you on
57:43 this show the only way you can create
57:44 more neural connections in your brain is
57:47 to think solve a problem in your mind
57:51 review your mind take inventory do that
57:55 thing I said way back in season 1 take
57:57 everything that you think is true or
57:58 false push it out the door like you're
58:00 fixing up your hoarding house bring
58:03 everything back into the room of your
58:05 brain and judge it again with your
58:07 current knowledge base say this is true
58:09 is this false or just I don't know you
58:11 got a left side your pantry and right
58:13 side your pantry with this center table
58:16 of you're undecided things that you have
58:19 accumulated over your life if you're
58:22 going to be on a journey you're gonna
58:24 want your brain to get more intense
58:25 every day you're alive it will give you
58:28 more tools it will give you more
58:30 processor power for every instruction
58:32 that comes through the processor I hope
58:35 that you're on a journey I hope that
58:38 you're in a tunnel and the tunnel is
58:39 beautiful tunnel will be weird at times
58:42 it'll be a bit like that tunnel ride in
58:44 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
58:46 back in 1973 it'll be scary sometimes as
58:52 long as you keep walking you keep living
58:54 I guarantee everything's bad in your
58:56 life will change as the guy told me when
59:00 I was trying to apply for a car with a
59:02 credit score of 540 he said when he when
59:07 he was notifying me that I was not gonna
59:09 be able to get the loan to buy the car
59:10 he said to me life's full of peaks and
59:14 valleys and he goes you're in a valley
59:17 right now and he goes you know what's
59:18 nice about that he goes there's only in
59:20 one place you can go when you're on
59:21 rock-bottom and that's up you might not
59:25 go straight up but what happens to a
59:27 plane when it goes straight up it stalls
59:28 right the best way to get high high
59:31 altitude is to just gradually move up
59:34 every day I know you feel me hopefully
59:39 this was helpful a little exercise for
59:40 your brain let's all get denser brains
59:44 let's all think
59:46 and I need your comments to stimulate
59:49 more thinking in me so before you
59:52 minimize it
59:53 it really helps I think I will tell you
59:55 this some of the best comments I get on
59:58 any one of these videos starts off like
60:00 this I've never posted a comment on a
60:03 video I've never had an account on
60:05 YouTube I'm not trying to suck you into
60:07 the global AI of all that [ __ ] but
60:10 unfortunately because there's so many
60:12 spammers in the world I can't open up a
60:13 forum on my website because it would get
60:15 full of all kinds of Rolex ads but the
60:18 quality of the first-time commenters are
60:20 some of the best comments I've ever read
60:22 sadly I don't see them post a second
60:24 time a lot of times but those first ones
60:27 are Jim so please get out there and
60:29 comment if you can obviously the game is
60:32 to like and subscribe if you if you have
60:34 this feeling that it's like man this
60:36 this channel should have a lot more
60:37 subscribers well there's two ways that
60:39 organically make that happen and that is
60:41 to comment and to LIKE and subscribe I
60:44 think this is three ways if you haven't
60:49 been to deep thoughts radio Calm please
60:50 go there's audio video a locked Facebook
60:53 group and patreon so until next time
60:57 take care of someone else and yourself
