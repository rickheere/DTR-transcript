00:31 [Music]
00:36 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:38 deep thoughts its September the hair is
00:42 getting longer this is where I start
00:44 enjoying life well that's a little windy
00:47 today I am smoking a beautiful Cohiba
00:53 that one of our amazing listeners
00:56 managed to send me so he's asked to
01:01 remain nameless but I'll just say this
01:04 thing's real it tastes delicious it's a
01:07 huge gauge and super appreciated today
01:11 we're gonna have a general conversation
01:13 about what is fake because what's
01:19 interesting is is you know I don't hear
01:21 a lot of dialogue about this on YouTube
01:23 but i you know i go to my smoke lounge
01:26 and we have little marathons every once
01:30 in a while of youtube stuff and it's
01:33 everything it's from space programs
01:36 stuff to Flat Earth to all the different
01:39 divisions of politics you know who is
01:44 Elon Musk Joan Rivers is still alive
01:47 Michelle Obama is supposedly a man you
01:50 know on and on and on it's everything
01:52 and it's very oftenly spoken that's even
01:57 a word oftenly
01:57 it's very often spoken you know what is
02:01 real anymore is the whole world fake is
02:04 that as the whole world a bunch of
02:06 conspiracies because it starts to pose a
02:09 dilemma where you know at some point man
02:13 needs to
02:13 be able to put two feet on the ground
02:15 and believe that that's earth or
02:18 someplace that you're supposed to be
02:21 right but when you start to wake up
02:24 there is almost this blowback that
02:29 happens when you get to a certain level
02:32 of ingesting things because you know if
02:35 you believe all the official stories of
02:36 the world and then you woke up and
02:38 you're starting to rejoice and finally
02:41 someone making chaos makes sense you
02:45 know the things that don't make any
02:46 sense that you know none of the laws
02:48 help out any of the citizens of a
02:50 country you can't go back as a historian
02:53 and charter this big [ __ ] utopian
02:56 thing that you know is their grand
03:00 master plan no it's a bunch of greedy
03:02 [ __ ] who are easily paid off who
03:04 have no loyalty to the world do not
03:06 believe in any God or afterlife okay
03:09 that's a very important thing
03:10 these are soulless human beings for
03:14 whatever reason to abuse through just
03:16 genetic retardation they do not believe
03:20 that they participate in an ecosystem of
03:23 greater lifeforce they could do whatever
03:25 the hell they want right so you start to
03:27 wake up and all these things start to
03:29 get explained and theories start to make
03:31 a hell of a lot more sense conspiracy
03:33 theories I will say I make a lot more
03:35 sense than anything that the public you
03:37 know forms of mass media or Barnes and
03:40 Noble can explain and there's some that
03:43 have smoking guns that are easy to prove
03:45 and then there's some that are sort of
03:48 just well it does make more sense but I
03:50 can't confirm it and so that goes on and
03:54 on and on like like a freight train you
03:55 just start getting excited about a boom
03:57 boom boom boom boom and then all of a
03:59 sudden you start you'll have like a
04:01 moment where you've stopped at the
04:03 stoplight and you're just taking a
04:05 little breather and you look around you
04:07 go where the hell am i I'm in a world of
04:10 utter conspiracy theories you know
04:13 there's conspiracy facts as well that
04:16 have come along with you but I think
04:19 that without getting the brochure of why
04:21 everything happens in the world there's
04:23 no matter how much how many conspiracy
04:26 facts you
04:27 leave you've uncovered there's there has
04:28 to be a circumstantial conspiracy theory
04:32 that is sort of the lining of it or the
04:35 cloud of the little fish that swim next
04:37 to your your bigger whale of conspiracy
04:39 fact and so all of that's a little
04:41 unnerving so what this episode is gonna
04:44 dive into is how do we get our ball
04:47 bearings in the middle of all this crazy
04:49 because and I'm gonna run through a ton
04:52 of conspiracies so for those of you who
04:55 like a lot of different subjects I'm
04:57 just gonna literally pull them out of my
04:58 head we're gonna analyze them for what
05:01 we know we don't know and and sort of
05:04 maybe temper our emotions around
05:07 subjects that don't have a tremendous
05:08 amount of certainty right but now let's
05:15 let's just take a quick second here a
05:17 little quick kind of orientation recap
05:21 it's gonna be a little existential but
05:24 it's I think a really good sort of
05:27 centrifuge in the middle of our
05:29 skyscraper that will keep us stable in
05:31 the middle of these earthquakes we call
05:32 conspiracies we are made of complete
05:38 truth the universe is made of complete
05:42 truth bar none that's reality okay now
05:50 as I said just very recently here but
05:52 it's good good time to remember this the
05:54 truth is the truth whether or not anyone
05:56 ever discovers it or if when discovered
05:58 anyone believes it so the beauty of
06:02 those two facts is that you are not far
06:05 away from the truth at any point in time
06:08 you are an integral part of pure capital
06:12 t truth so for those who believe in
06:15 Gnostic connections or antenna
06:17 connections or frequency holographic
06:19 universe connections to the universe I
06:21 want you to see yourself really sort of
06:25 blister packed in the truth and so
06:29 accessing what is encompassing you and
06:33 creating you and sustaining you
06:34 shouldn't be a big stretch but because
06:38 we perceive there's a distance between
06:39 us and the true
06:41 someone else has it incubated inside
06:43 some container we can't get to the
06:45 container in our minds and so we can't
06:48 have the truth why say that one because
06:53 in trying to find the truth it is
06:56 important that you don't get yourself
06:58 into a despair algorithm where you feel
07:00 as if there's some sort of lack of faith
07:03 that you'll ever find it or that there's
07:05 a methodology to find out don't you want
07:07 to say the word hope that's sort of a
07:09 fake emotion right
07:11 you can long for something but hope is
07:17 sort of this pacification for not
07:20 getting anything that you're looking for
07:22 right just asking anyone who supported
07:25 Obama what I think is very interesting
07:28 about trying to find out what is true
07:29 and what is false in this world is that
07:31 there's no formal artery that is sort of
07:36 the constant of the universe for us to
07:38 ever find out anything besides waking up
07:43 engaging your known senses whichever
07:46 ones you're willing to acknowledge your
07:47 body has and simply saying as it occurs
07:51 to me right now this is what I believe
07:53 is happening you check us Kali galaxy as
07:56 I keep going back it's one of the most
07:57 brilliant journeys of internal and
08:02 external realities meaning what's inside
08:05 your consciousness and what is outside
08:07 in the real world they meet the guy that
08:08 they believe runs the galaxy and he is
08:11 so as existential I've mentioned him in
08:13 the past but they asked him you know if
08:17 he has a cat and he says well I think I
08:19 do you know I call his name and he comes
08:21 to me and I feed him and I think it's a
08:22 cat so he was living in an absolute
08:26 abstract sort of interpretation of
08:29 reality he only measured his senses and
08:33 the now and wasn't completely convinced
08:37 that anything was occurring which I
08:39 think the way that Douglas wrote it was
08:41 utterly brilliant back in the day I've
08:43 never heard anyone attempt to write such
08:45 a thing and any other fictional piece
08:47 I'm sure it's happened but for me that
08:49 was the first time I'd ever seen it why
08:51 is that important to us to remember such
08:53 a thing well
08:54 let me ask any of you who have made
08:56 maybe 25 or above and you can remember
08:59 back when you thought something was one
09:03 way when you were younger and you
09:05 realized and you were just certain and
09:07 you went ten years plus thinking it was
09:09 a certain way and when you grew up and
09:11 your conviction of believing it a
09:13 certain way turned out to be you know
09:16 just fizzled away and you're like well I
09:18 don't even care if any one nobody even
09:19 knows this happened in my life and so I
09:23 can now just retell the story in my own
09:26 brain as something totally different you
09:28 know Santa Claus is one of those
09:30 examples in one way or the other we we
09:32 all get kind of baptized out of that
09:34 belief realm right so now you know as
09:38 Marshall McLuhan said you know medium is
09:40 the message and what are the mediums by
09:41 which we take it information well the
09:44 most pristine method of taking an
09:46 information and it doesn't really it
09:50 doesn't really call out the whole notion
09:52 of whether it's true or false but it's
09:53 really human to human interaction you
09:57 know maybe you would say the very first
10:00 zero-point medium that exists is you and
10:03 your senses and the universe let's say
10:05 the last man on in in the last man
10:08 standing on planet Earth you know we're
10:10 the first men and you're you know
10:12 walking around this planet just
10:14 experiencing things well then you can
10:16 play that role that the guy did and
10:18 Hitchhiker's Guide were you're kind of
10:19 going well it looks like a lake it feels
10:20 like water looks like the Sun it
10:22 certainly it certainly is warm as I
10:24 understand the Sun to be and you're just
10:26 building up reality as you experience it
10:29 that's your that's your personal realm
10:31 the next room down is human to human
10:33 interaction having a conversation hoping
10:36 to God that your language is the same
10:38 languages they speak and then even
10:40 within your own language theirs might be
10:42 10,000 symbols that you use to
10:44 communicate and they have 10,000 symbols
10:46 in their brain so there's no shortage of
10:48 understanding each other's speech
10:51 now I'm gonna gloss over the fact that
10:54 there's all kinds of you know facial
10:57 communications body language
10:58 communications and all that stuff we're
11:01 going to stick with conversational stuff
11:03 but then we get into artificial sort of
11:07 all right maybe artificials the wrong
11:09 word but I would say almost replication
11:12 media mediums what is a magazine a
11:17 newspaper in a book it's a replication
11:20 of someone's thought process into those
11:22 symbols it sort of lacks any context of
11:25 inflection you know in all of us text
11:27 today we we know that there's a lack of
11:31 inflection and it's frustrating when you
11:37 read something wrong but what is really
11:39 fascinating about it is and some writers
11:41 might contest that a good writer can
11:43 communicate such things but how many
11:45 times we've been reading these written
11:47 words on paper or now in electronic
11:50 devices and we believe that we are
11:52 getting the proper inflection from the
11:54 writer you know because an inflection
11:57 completely changes the context of the
11:59 information but then we got the
12:02 Telegraph then we got the telephone then
12:05 we got the radio then we got television
12:07 then we got film actually started filmed
12:11 in television and so now we have the
12:14 internet which is birthed a tremendous
12:16 enhancement of image quality sound
12:19 quality etc and these are the mediums
12:22 that now that's that's like the the
12:25 carrier wave right you know when I teach
12:28 internet protocol stuff I always teach
12:30 them that you know tcp/ip the protocol
12:33 that pretty much runs most of the
12:34 internet is sort of like the telegram
12:37 technology but within the telegram
12:39 grandma could be giving us a recipe for
12:41 pie so inside that we have how to make a
12:45 pie and that's a little sub protocol sub
12:47 method of communication get some sugar
12:49 get some this heat up the oven to that
12:51 it's a set of steps that allow you to
12:53 make a pie so on the outside the
12:54 telegram has a set of rules that allows
12:56 it to transfer from point A to point B
12:58 guys gotta learn Morse code tap-tap-tap
13:01 crosses all these different state lines
13:03 until you get the message wherever you
13:04 live but within MSH as a sub protocol
13:07 which is the message on how to make a
13:10 pie
13:12 think of it the same way a telephone
13:15 allows two people to communicate now in
13:18 the past it was just me talking to you
13:21 and then it was sort of disembodied
13:23 version of me being with you hey that's
13:25 still very functional I'm not getting
13:27 any of your facial recognition you know
13:29 I'm not getting your face little tics
13:31 and features and body language you could
13:33 be rolling your eyes saying oh yeah I
13:35 totally like you and you know you're
13:36 making the face like get rid of this
13:38 person you know you know then we have
13:41 film and film is a visual medium at
13:45 first and then it be got sound you know
13:47 in the 30s and I just got sound before
13:52 that but you know it allowed fictional
13:56 stories to be told there are stage plays
13:59 and things I'm overlooking but when you
14:03 can mass distribute a product it is way
14:06 more powerful than someone saying I'm
14:08 going to do Macbeth in New York on
14:10 Broadway and it's 1912 well you have to
14:13 go to Broadway to see that particular
14:15 production but if I can film it and
14:17 distributed it to a hundred thousand
14:19 theaters across the United States now
14:21 you've got a power behind that medium
14:23 that's really huge and we have to cover
14:27 mediums before we get into this fake
14:29 thing because this is how we're getting
14:31 our information that makes us really
14:32 they're comfortable or uncomfortable
14:33 this is where we're judging whether or
14:35 not we get truth or or an untruth for
14:38 something right when the internet came
14:42 up with HTTP protocol right hypertext
14:45 Transfer Protocol we were allowed to
14:47 send anything of any medium from one
14:50 computer to another sound movies
14:53 pictures written word we're able to you
14:57 know use different typefaces and make it
14:59 beautiful now we're bringing back 3d
15:01 which should be amazing all kinds of
15:03 really cool things are going on on the
15:05 internet the internet never cease to be
15:06 cool but brilliant people got in a room
15:12 and planned how to get society strung
15:16 out on the Internet as almost the the
15:19 equivalency to your autonomic system in
15:22 your body try not going to the internet
15:25 for an
15:25 tired day when you're not on vacation
15:28 try that really difficult really really
15:32 difficult for a lot of folks what
15:35 Marshall McLuhan was warning the world
15:36 about is that to the to the degree of
15:38 medium is able to engage your senses
15:41 is to the degree it becomes a
15:44 manipulation mechanism over and above
15:47 the information itself I'll give an
15:51 example it's kind of a bad example but
15:53 it'll kind of get you on the right track
15:55 with what I'm talking about here bad
15:58 things have happened around the world
15:59 every single day that everyone has been
16:01 alive on this planet it's never maybe
16:03 the first tribes out there but someone's
16:07 getting it by a lion today someone has
16:09 died in a car crash today etc etc
16:12 horrific things sometimes by accident
16:15 sometimes by intent correct okay now
16:18 what happens today well you've got ad
16:21 agencies that sell ads for their
16:24 customers and they find that they have
16:27 found excuse me that the news agencies
16:29 are a beautiful place to sell ads
16:31 Marshall McLuhan as well in the late 60s
16:34 said you know the reason why news is
16:37 real negative is because the the pavlo
16:40 nyan triggers that they're installing in
16:41 your brain is that when you see a
16:42 mr.clean commercial right after some
16:45 horrible massacre coverage mr. clean is
16:48 now responsible for sort of making
16:51 everything better it's an oasis of
16:54 retreat from horrific news right
16:58 so today horrible news is reported all
17:03 around the globe there's a woman missing
17:05 there's a baby missing somebody killed
17:08 somebody somebody did something and now
17:09 it's broadcast just randomly right and
17:12 you know they just that shit's happening
17:13 in the thousands every day they only
17:16 carry pick a couple little stories
17:18 finding out which ones have the more
17:20 sympathetic empathetic arcs and will be
17:23 more riveting it's like a producer
17:25 making a reality show but instead of
17:28 [ __ ] starting it they just cherry-pick
17:30 from the chaos of the universe put that
17:32 on the front page create a buzz around
17:35 it and the buzz creates loyalty to the
17:38 buzz
17:39 right so if I can make a housewife
17:40 freaked out about the conclusion to a
17:44 show and she's just got to see this show
17:47 every week or some missing person thing
17:50 that that he or she is interested in and
17:55 your eyeballs keep coming back and we
17:58 have taught these news agencies that
18:00 were that [ __ ] gullible that we care
18:03 that much right and this is something
18:07 society needs to sort of undo now the
18:09 beautiful thing is is that television
18:11 isn't television like it used to be
18:14 anymore we prefer to pay $11 a month and
18:17 have no commercials we prefer to pay
18:20 that money and marathon show completely
18:22 after the seasons done how many times
18:25 have you heard a friend say I'm not
18:27 watching any of it until it's on Netflix
18:29 because I want a marathon the whole
18:30 thing I can't be strung out on you know
18:34 Monday nights at 8 o'clock for you know
18:37 six months
18:39 I want a marathon this thing and get
18:41 some pizzas and just see it all once
18:44 okay if you did not have an internet web
18:47 page associated with your preferred news
18:50 source how would this the thing that I
18:53 just told you be possible and this is
18:57 Marshall McLuhan's point if you had to
19:00 wait for news at 11 but you're always
19:02 asleep at 10:30 you never see news at 11
19:05 and so the addictions that they're
19:07 trying to stick in your mind at 11 never
19:10 occur in your mind but now news is 24/7
19:14 these you know it's a headline news on
19:17 CNN which I used to watch before I
19:19 realized who they were but now you have
19:22 web pages they're available all day long
19:24 and so you can get crappy information in
19:28 your brain constantly the addiction sore
19:31 you know everyone's always trying to
19:33 chastise everyone about addictions you
19:35 know I made it up slow down cigars and
19:37 some guy came in and said how much of a
19:39 dick I was for having dared to make an
19:42 addiction episode when I'm smoking a
19:44 cigar I have been fully disclosed about
19:48 this thing right so
19:52 before we just just before we jump into
19:55 some of these conspiracies that have to
19:57 do with what's fake and what's real
19:59 because a lot of people ask me where do
20:01 I get my information from and I've given
20:02 several answers over the years you know
20:05 part of it is to just be able to read
20:06 between the lines to keep agendas of
20:08 bankers in your head at all times so
20:11 that you understand once you understand
20:14 the agenda of a banker which is complete
20:16 control and domination and the
20:17 destruction of everything sovereign
20:20 including individual rights nation
20:22 borders all that stuff globalism coming
20:25 in and creating regions instead of
20:26 nations all that [ __ ] population control
20:29 that everything that you see on the news
20:31 starts to make a hell of a lot of sense
20:32 right but all of our sources are so
20:36 abstract aren't they in terms of form
20:39 YouTube is it a very very fascinating
20:42 experiment as long as you sort of take
20:45 control of what you're looking at on the
20:48 channel on up well sorry say I say on
20:50 that channel that is YouTube
20:52 if you're clicking on recommended tab
20:54 you are inviting yourself to be duped
20:59 because there's algorithms that will
21:01 satiate you with sort of in a lot of
21:05 cases cleansed videos you know videos
21:09 that don't mention certain sort of
21:11 touchy subjects that they don't want you
21:13 to listen to now obviously because they
21:16 they have to keep the conspiracy of
21:18 manipulating what you see sort of hidden
21:21 under the carpet you can still find your
21:24 buddies video that says all the things
21:25 that they don't want you to hear but you
21:27 have to find the direct link to it
21:28 because they will do what they call
21:30 ghosting you and I've had a few
21:33 listeners run some tests for me to see
21:37 on computers that have never been to
21:40 YouTube when they search on certain
21:42 subjects that we have on this show like
21:44 the moon hoax which is is approaching
21:47 nine thousand views in episode 26 they
21:51 searched on moon hoax and I was number
21:53 two that's pretty cool right now of
21:57 course they could be sensing IPs and
21:59 doing kind of a cross analysis but some
22:02 folks have gone to work and tested it
22:04 and said it comes up so that's good
22:05 because there's
22:06 is there is a concern with some of the
22:09 users that we're getting what's called
22:10 ghosted which is this channel is not
22:11 being included in the search results
22:14 which is why our subscriptions literally
22:17 are painstakingly slow right for me hey
22:21 man I just do my thing people dig it
22:23 that's great the episodes are really
22:25 long so that chases away a lot again a
22:27 lot of the kind of lowbrow viewers no
22:30 offense but just we have thinkers who
22:33 subscribe you know but YouTube is this
22:38 amazing melting pot of society that can
22:42 go in all directions you know and there
22:44 are channels that have a tremendous
22:46 amount integrity and there are channels
22:48 that have absolutely no integrity you
22:50 know I saw this funny one there's a
22:53 channel out there called apex TV at the
22:55 time of this recording and they're
22:59 they're having a lot of fun with all the
23:01 conspiracies and they just make [ __ ] up
23:04 and they interviewed some like 15 year
23:06 old kid and tried to act like he was a
23:08 time traveler and they they blurred out
23:10 his face because you know they knew he
23:14 was like 15 years old or something like
23:16 that he's no older than 18 I'll tell you
23:18 that much
23:18 and the kid was reading from a script'
23:20 and God bless them they created a little
23:22 piece of entertainment but that's what
23:26 that channel is it's entertainment and
23:27 it's it's a more power to them and knock
23:30 it out but you know nothing's real in
23:33 that channel it's just interesting but
23:35 those that's the freedom we have with
23:37 YouTube and Facebook doesn't really have
23:41 in my opinion the amount of fun and
23:44 entertainment on the on Facebook is sort
23:46 of non-existent yeah you might find your
23:48 favorite movie has the [ __ ] webpage
23:51 you know but whatever YouTube's a lot
23:54 more fun and I think in my travels
24:01 YouTube is Grand Central Station for
24:05 conspiracy development incubation and
24:09 validation or you know elimination
24:15 because it's so easy just to look at a
24:19 video you're doing
24:20 something else in your office you're
24:21 doing something else around your house
24:22 and you can just put it in the
24:24 background listen to it if it's not much
24:26 on the visual side of things like this
24:28 show or you know something someone's
24:31 breaking down a bunch of ISS videos I'm
24:34 showing you why they think it's fake you
24:35 know so let's get into it
24:38 what's faking what's real well there's a
24:42 little bit of a division there isn't
24:43 there let's take flat earth vs. globe
24:48 earth one could say one is fake and one
24:51 is real what's really going on is we
24:54 have a space agency at least in America
24:58 that we don't trust they've lied about
25:01 everything not everything but they've
25:03 lied about their biggest accomplishments
25:05 in most cases and so once the
25:07 credibility of these agencies is proven
25:09 to the average public then you have to
25:12 take into account that you and I
25:15 personally have never seen the earth
25:17 from any level of elevation that would
25:19 give us curvature definitely not a plane
25:22 not to give a [ __ ] if you're in a
25:23 private jet flying it you know
25:25 forty-five thousand feet you are not
25:27 gonna see the curvature of the earth you
25:29 just don't you know the ability to do it
25:31 so you're gonna have to rely on other
25:33 mechanisms to see curvature which is
25:37 going to prove to you one way or the
25:38 other so we have all these experiments
25:40 on earth that we believe give us either
25:43 a flat earth outcome or a Coriolis
25:46 effect of you know bending earth and we
25:51 get very loyal to one thing or the other
25:53 but let me tell you this this is what I
25:56 find
25:56 I believe so far I'm more towards the
25:59 globe earth because again I always say
26:01 expanding earth is my game the old atoms
26:04 expanding or search on and on YouTube
26:06 expanding earth I think once you see it
26:09 it's very tough to unsee it and I don't
26:12 know if any circular disk mechanism that
26:15 can make that a reality at all because
26:16 the base of the earth would not come
26:19 together perfectly in this model in this
26:22 algorithm which is very strict it's a
26:25 very strict algorithm of how the sphere
26:29 expanded from the you know Pacific and
26:31 Atlantic Ocean okay you've heard me say
26:32 that a hundred times
26:33 all right however okay we've got flight
26:38 paths that make complete sense on a flat
26:40 earth map and do not make any sense on a
26:42 globe map I mean on an economic level
26:45 having developed corporations and run
26:48 them myself being responsible for the
26:50 bottom line
26:51 staying in the positive black looking at
26:54 a plane that is taking you know
26:56 potentially a 13-hour X you know
26:58 diversion up to lands that when it could
27:01 just fly over the Pacific you know from
27:02 South America to to Africa they're
27:05 flying all the way up and bouncing off
27:07 something in the northern hemisphere it
27:08 makes no sense at all
27:09 because the responsibility of a plane
27:14 Airlines I should say is to get the
27:16 passengers on get them to their
27:18 destination as quickly as possible
27:19 expending less the least amount of fuel
27:21 and get the back and if they got enough
27:24 fuel to fly up north to the north
27:26 northern hemisphere and bounce off an
27:27 airport and down and there's plenty of
27:29 fuel for any emergency landing that
27:31 would need to occur up be it turning
27:33 around going to some some of the remote
27:35 islands in the Atlantic that been set up
27:37 for such emergencies right there's no
27:39 rationale why these flight pastures so
27:42 goddamn long doesn't make any sense
27:44 so that's one that supports Flat Earth
27:48 the second one that supports flutter
27:50 that I thought I would never see
27:51 explained let alone demonstrated with
27:54 physical hardware okay which basically a
27:56 lens in a picture is that you know for a
28:00 while there I was going around just for
28:03 the sake that I see the Sun I live on
28:05 the coast of California here so I see
28:07 the sunset on the ocean all the time
28:10 and when you see the sunset on the ocean
28:12 you're sitting there they can in your
28:13 brain the sun's around okay the moon's
28:15 round round shadows seem to get on the
28:18 moon somehow and this damn Sun sets and
28:21 so I'm just thinking come on guys isn't
28:23 it obvious that we're probably round two
28:25 and everything else is round all the
28:26 planets around that we can see out there
28:28 right again I've seen Saturn with rings
28:32 in my buddies backyard with a telescope
28:35 so it wasn't I've also seen Jupiter at
28:37 the Griffith Observatory
28:39 so I could say Griffith might have
28:41 messed with it whereas my buddy
28:43 definitely did not okay but when the guy
28:47 did the experiment with the lens on the
28:50 tabletop which was a lens that was the
28:54 exact refraction of light that's
28:56 supposed to happen in the atmosphere and
28:57 this is official science not flat earth
29:00 science and you just didn't film it with
29:03 the camera and pull the picture of the
29:05 Sun back well the Sun never changes its
29:08 elevation it's on an l-shaped piece of
29:09 paper and you pull it back and the damn
29:12 thing sets in your eye sight from the
29:14 camera view who would have thought that
29:17 would have ever been possible to run
29:19 such a simple experiment and see that so
29:22 now all the sudden if we are objective
29:24 we don't come at it from any bias or
29:27 butthurt you have to acknowledge that
29:30 the Sun can set on a flat point due to
29:32 the refraction of light through the
29:35 atmosphere and especially over an ocean
29:37 so what is fake and what is real what is
29:41 true and what is false how do we figure
29:43 this crap out and how do we deal with
29:47 the fact that there are seemingly you
29:51 know it's not infinite but damn the
29:53 finite quantity of conspiracy's is
29:57 overwhelming for most human beings how
29:59 many little switches and circuits do we
30:01 have in our brain to remember things I
30:03 think that the memory of men has
30:07 probably been excellent in the past
30:10 super toxified in the last hundred years
30:12 and I think that through the movement of
30:15 sort of this Renaissance 2.0 of nature
30:19 and health a lot of us are getting our
30:21 brains wired a hell of a lot better and
30:25 again the more you think the more you
30:27 overburden your neurons with electricity
30:29 which kicks off the replication cycle
30:31 and therefore the more that you think
30:33 the more than you you increase your
30:36 neural net in your brain your neuron net
30:40 in your brain despite doctors telling
30:42 you that you don't generate any more
30:43 brain cells after like 10 years old it's
30:46 been utterly utterly proven dozens of
30:49 times with brain dye tests to not be
30:52 true
30:53 people in their late 70s late 80s have
30:57 they're still developing new brain cells
30:58 so never believe that crap all right now
31:02 what happens when let's just say you
31:05 have 20/20 sockets in your brain which
31:11 in what I'm about to say it this would
31:12 be a very high account but you have 20
31:15 sockets in your brain where you can
31:16 remember individual topics and you can
31:19 remember them at a very detailed level
31:21 so these aren't just little thumbnails
31:24 or door knobs to the doors that go into
31:26 more elaborate rooms know you can
31:28 maintain in your brain 20 rooms at once
31:31 of the details of 911 Sandy Hook blah
31:36 blah blah moon missions everything now
31:39 when you start the journey let's
31:41 remember how this Anatomy works before
31:43 you ever hear a single conspiracy here's
31:46 the thing the twenty rooms that you've
31:48 got for your brain are all full of
31:50 official stories truth with a capital T
31:53 in your brain initially right then you
31:55 begin to wake up because something
31:57 doesn't feel right one of the rooms has
31:59 an anomaly one of this rooms has an
32:01 impossibility you know looking at JFK
32:04 take all the bullets in the car
32:06 you definitely subconsciously feel the
32:10 conspiracy you do whether or not you
32:13 have the balls to do the research and
32:15 acknowledge that there were probably
32:16 over 27 gunmen firing at that car that
32:20 day with bullets ricocheting off curbs
32:23 going through windshields hitting the
32:25 chrome molding around the windshield you
32:27 know one comes in from the back of his
32:29 throat one goes to the front of his head
32:30 I mean give me a [ __ ] break if you
32:32 think that was Lee Harvey Oswald but you
32:35 feel it before you know all the facts
32:37 and you simply you don't really know the
32:39 motives you know we think we've got a
32:41 pretty good set of choices on that but
32:44 once one of the rooms goes
32:46 conspiratorial then that's when the
32:49 conflict is resolved across all your
32:51 rooms and we have one of these things is
32:53 not like the other and that's the seed
32:56 of awakening once you are taught the
33:00 formula things aren't the way that you
33:01 think they are you're willing to
33:03 reevaluate your other rooms
33:06 now maybe that a lawyer rooms come out
33:09 clean because the events that you've put
33:11 in those rooms are your own personal
33:12 life and you've got all the empirical
33:14 information you need about what you
33:16 actually did but the second you start
33:18 putting in new things and even just the
33:20 the the approach of saying I'm gonna
33:24 search on a conspiracy I'm just gonna
33:26 type in conspiracy into YouTube and hit
33:29 search and see what happens I can
33:31 guarantee you that search result is
33:33 extremely cleansed right so you're gonna
33:35 need some probably dark net search
33:39 engine that's not owned by a major
33:41 corporation to give you a better result
33:44 on that but once you can start saying
33:47 well I'm gonna archive this room's data
33:50 because I don't really need to remember
33:52 what happened to me when I was five
33:53 years old as great as that RIM room
33:54 might be I'm gonna move that one off to
33:56 long-term storage I'm gonna reuse this
33:58 little socket for the next conspiracy
34:01 I'm going to investigate whatever your
34:04 account is in your brain you will
34:06 eventually consume most of your rooms
34:08 probably not all of them because you
34:10 need a little bit of sanity right you
34:12 need a room for your your immediate life
34:14 your now moments your family your kids
34:16 your relatives your job all that stuff
34:18 but once you pass the 50% mark or the B
34:23 of seven containers or 20 or 100
34:24 whatever that's when you start getting
34:26 this this question which is all about
34:29 this episode which is you start to go
34:31 Jesus I need to know what reality really
34:34 is I need to know because I have to
34:37 operate in reality and I really want to
34:40 know just you know there's some of it's
34:42 just a matter of purification within
34:44 your soul you want to have pure
34:46 information you want to be built from
34:50 truth and not harbor inside of you lies
34:54 now there's a lot of baby boomers that
34:57 are obviously a bunch of them are waking
35:00 up and I want to say personal thanks to
35:02 those who watch this show there's
35:05 nothing more well I shouldn't say
35:08 nothing more but it is a real treat for
35:11 me to hear that you guys out there that
35:13 are guys and girls who are older than me
35:16 I'm 48 years old so to hear that your
35:20 blessing me with your presence and
35:22 willing to take my information believe
35:24 me I consider you my elders regardless
35:26 of what our differences are and I really
35:28 appreciate that
35:31 but when we cross that 50% line we
35:34 there's sometimes a panic even if just a
35:37 flicker of a light just boom oh my god
35:39 what's going on here but you try to
35:44 you'll go through various phases you
35:47 know and I have a whole episode on
35:48 waking up and I'm kind of advancing to
35:51 waking up 2.0 in this particular episode
35:53 which i think is important but we tend
35:57 to we tend to have this sort of
36:00 conflicting moment in our mind where we
36:02 want the truth but even with the most
36:06 dedicated perseverance of the truth
36:09 there'll be these moments when you have
36:11 a shock to your heart and you don't want
36:14 to acknowledge that shock has occurred
36:17 so if you're like me you'll push the
36:20 shock out and you'll simply go well this
36:24 emotion doesn't really have any value to
36:26 my immediate or long-term presence in
36:29 this world I need to toughen up I need
36:33 to be more resilient towards doubt
36:37 because you know let's say you're
36:40 supposed to walk from point A to point B
36:42 all right let's say let's not use the
36:44 word suppose let's just say that you've
36:46 decided to go from point A to point B
36:48 and it's a path down some trail but
36:53 you're not quite sure how that how long
36:55 the distances between point A and point
36:57 B you've been told this is the yellow
36:59 brick road and it'll eventually get you
37:00 to the Wizard of Oz the City of Oz with
37:03 the wizard in there if you have to walk
37:05 too long down that path there's gonna be
37:07 a moment when you go God is this one
37:10 this is really gonna take me there I
37:13 can't see the city from where I am I've
37:15 been on really high mountains and I
37:19 still can't see the city in the distance
37:21 but I see the road continue is this is
37:24 this a ruse am I being had does this go
37:27 to a cliff you know some of you have
37:30 suffered slings and arrows of
37:32 outrageous characterization attacks our
37:36 character attacks I should say for
37:38 daring to question things and so
37:41 sometimes you know it would be as if
37:44 there's Raiders on the road to this new
37:47 destination and you keep getting rolled
37:50 you keep getting threatened you have
37:52 arrows that graze you and hit you
37:55 everyone someone you have to stop and
37:57 recover because the people that you love
37:59 and respect the most aren't on the same
38:02 path and so they have the ability to you
38:06 know throw pellets at you you're trying
38:10 to better the entire planet by gaining
38:12 and insight you have made a deal with
38:14 God let's just say and you're like I
38:16 don't care how much it hurts I want to
38:17 know the truth let's go to our next one
38:21 I'm trying to figure out how to do a
38:23 whole episode on this subject but Eric
38:24 Dubay did such a great debut episode on
38:27 the subject matter it's sort of like
38:28 you're done you did it all which is the
38:31 theory that dinosaurs never existed now
38:35 you've heard me mention this a couple
38:37 times on the show before the way I view
38:40 this goes to the following which is and
38:45 there's a weird anomaly with his claim
38:46 and another claim on Wikipedia which is
38:50 and some other official news sites they
38:52 differ on what the first dinosaur relic
38:55 was that kicked off the theory again it
38:58 only happened in the eighteen late 1850s
39:01 I believe was like 1857 or something
39:04 like that where they you know Eric
39:06 debate has discovered that they found a
39:08 tooth just a little tooth and they
39:10 imagine this dinosaur around the tooth
39:13 and god damn it if it wasn't completely
39:15 correct right that should just be a
39:19 smoking gun in itself that it can't be
39:22 what they said then you have another
39:27 theory that was a other claim I should
39:29 say it was a femur bone that was found
39:31 now the one thing I want to remind you
39:33 is when you strip us all down to bones
39:37 it just we are all sort of classified
39:39 and whether or not we're bipedal
39:41 quadruped ed or more we start looking
39:44 very similar once you start taking all
39:46 the flesh off and all the hair and all
39:48 them you know sunglasses and all that
39:49 crap we do look really similar you know
39:52 I've been to these museums where they're
39:53 full of skeletons or museums I went to
39:57 the museum where it's the guy that
39:58 dehydrates all the flesh it's like this
40:01 flesh museum which I have to say I spent
40:07 about an hour there and there's a point
40:09 there's like this morbid point where
40:11 your stomach kind of turns you know I
40:14 don't consider myself to have a weak
40:16 stomach whatsoever but there was just a
40:19 point where staring at the insides of
40:21 individuals just got weird so
40:25 cannibalizing living beings you know to
40:27 fake dinosaurs and then finding
40:31 fossilized skeletons from the past may
40:35 give you the sense that these things are
40:36 real but where did that whole thing come
40:39 from
40:40 it wasn't invented by Eric Dubay Eric
40:42 Dubay de Nelson also did not invent the
40:45 post globe Earth retraction to Flat
40:49 Earth that was not his thing the book
40:51 was written in the eighteen hundreds 100
40:52 proofs while he believed that the earth
40:54 is flat still and you know the other
40:58 thing is that the pedigrees and the lack
41:00 of of sort of usurping their status to
41:04 gain things in life the scientists that
41:07 came back and said you know what I don't
41:09 think we've really proven that the world
41:10 is a globe it may be a globe but we
41:13 haven't proven it yet very fascinating
41:16 so let's parse for a split second tiny
41:21 conspiracies versus biggest big
41:23 conspiracies and it is interesting that
41:26 in our brains we can almost
41:29 instantaneously measure whether our
41:32 conspiracy seems big our conspiracy
41:36 seems small usually the magnitude in our
41:39 brain for whether our conspiracy is big
41:41 or small has a deal with the amount of
41:43 people that the conspiracy is affecting
41:45 or the amount of sensationalized history
41:49 around a particular conspiracy is on the
41:52 bookshelves you know in the science
41:54 classes when I tell a person hey man I'm
41:57 not totally convinced that dinosaurs
41:59 ever existed
42:00 you know man has excavated millions of
42:05 metric tons of soil around the world and
42:08 no no culture before 1800s ever reported
42:12 finding a bone but the Egyptians the
42:15 Egyptians you know probably excavated
42:17 the amount of soil that's in Rhode
42:19 Island out of the ground to build
42:21 everything that they built and they
42:22 never bumped into a thing so did the
42:23 Incas pre Incas Chinese Japanese all the
42:27 Europeans we've been digging in the
42:29 ground for a really long time and the
42:30 idea that we missed all these bones one
42:32 today you can just find them on the
42:33 surface of the earth willy-nilly it's
42:37 pretty conclusive for me there's
42:38 something up there all right
42:40 if GMO foods do what we think they do
42:43 which is terminate the the fertility and
42:47 man because they have a termination
42:49 terminated gene sequence in the food to
42:51 keep them from generating seeds after
42:53 being harvest that seems pretty huge
42:56 right but the amount of people
42:59 complaining about that isn't so huge to
43:02 begin with people complaining about
43:03 fluoride in toothpaste and fluoride in
43:06 water it's a big deal it absolutely
43:08 annihilates your pineal gland and
43:10 annihilate your ability to think clearly
43:12 makes you docile to whatever forces step
43:16 up to the plate to control you there's
43:20 not a lot of people talking about it was
43:21 really hot about five 10 years ago and
43:23 now let's calm down so that conspiracy
43:25 seems a little smaller right
43:27 there's conspiracies about how your
43:29 television cable is sold to you there's
43:32 conspiracies about how Internet is sold
43:34 to a business versus a home same exact
43:37 technology but all they do is they say
43:38 oh you're a business it's ten times the
43:40 amount of money because we're just gonna
43:42 screw you because we know you have more
43:44 liquid cash at your disposal than a
43:47 family it doesn't have an you know
43:48 brick-and-mortar store or an office of
43:52 some sort right the magnitude of a
43:55 conspiracy contributes greatly to your
43:58 sort of your resilience and your
44:01 perseverance and your endurance to keep
44:03 your analysis on a particular conspiracy
44:07 inertia inertia is the the the constant
44:13 in the you know
44:14 at any one given location when you
44:16 isolate down to a particular force group
44:21 that it resists all outside forces on it
44:25 right so when you're charging along say
44:28 you're running full bore down the street
44:30 and someone tries to push you they've
44:32 got to counteract your force moving
44:34 forward to knock you off your path so
44:36 your brain works the same way but we're
44:39 influenced by the mediums around us
44:41 right when it gets pounded and pounded
44:43 and pounded that climate change is real
44:46 all right
44:48 society is largely a tell grabbing
44:51 construct right everyone's trying to fit
44:53 in through tribalism and boy you want to
44:55 be on that winning team constantly
44:57 because you can't you know people can't
44:59 own their own minds and so they just
45:01 kind of go with the flow they don't have
45:03 enough academic brilliance to figure out
45:05 what's real what's not everyone's always
45:07 complained about the weather since the
45:10 beginning of time and now we have really
45:14 a bunch of brilliant greedy people that
45:18 want to depopulate the world using
45:20 carbon taxation to make baby making cost
45:23 a lot of money to make being alive cost
45:25 a lot of money right they're using
45:27 climate changes the technique to start
45:28 carbon credits right carbon credits are
45:31 you know that will be worth trillions
45:34 and trillions of dollars if they ever
45:35 get turned on the way that they trying
45:37 to turn them on so the amount of
45:39 billions of dollars they're willing to
45:41 put behind this scam to depopulate the
45:44 world it's it's probably the biggest
45:48 conspiracy on the planet at this current
45:50 point it's got the most money behind it
45:53 and it will continue to be that way
45:55 until something breaks someone's got a
45:58 defect over and over and over again from
46:01 all these different organizations and
46:02 it's happening pretty much every month
46:05 or so someone from inside goes yeah it's
46:07 a bunch of [ __ ] right but the press
46:11 is completely controlled by them so it
46:13 gets very little press at least it gets
46:16 it gets very little press without utter
46:19 ridicul behind it right but how do they
46:23 manipulate our brains through medium
46:27 right television radio webpages all the
46:32 above on websites
46:36 it'll make you question whether or not
46:38 you're you're you know believe in the
46:41 truth or not you know we have a bunch of
46:43 hurricanes going on right now in 2017
46:45 depending on when you're watching this
46:47 people are saying well look isn't that
46:50 proof that global warming is happening
46:53 right climate change we have a service
46:58 in the United States of America that can
47:00 erase a storm for about a hundred
47:01 thousand dollars over a wedding making
47:04 sure that there's no physical weather
47:07 anomalies over the ceremony China
47:10 weather controlled over there Olympics
47:12 and create a big monsoon that kill
47:13 people all right you've heard me say
47:15 this a couple times on the show why
47:18 would Harvey why would Emma Jose all
47:26 these different hurricanes that are
47:27 happening right now be allowed to exist
47:31 when we can just take a fleet of c-130s
47:34 and de-seed that thing in two seconds
47:38 meteorologist and in both meteorologists
47:41 who are professionals and those who
47:42 educate meteorology have made videos now
47:46 on youtube showing that what they
47:47 believe to be harvey being refueled five
47:49 times the the atlantic oceans covered in
47:53 chemtrails they have nothing to do with
47:55 register flight paths and the funny
47:57 thing is is Flat Earth actually helps us
47:59 know that because we have researched so
48:01 many of the flight paths of the Atlantic
48:03 to figure out this weird anomaly of them
48:06 going in this curve which then is a
48:09 straight line on the Flat Earth model
48:10 that we know that there's no commercial
48:12 flights going over a lot of these areas
48:13 and it's so persistent and is so dense
48:17 that any one time you would take this
48:19 shot in a commercial room there be
48:22 planes in the in the pictures you know
48:25 so going back to the analogy of the
48:28 rooms in your brain
48:29 the little sockets you have to you know
48:32 keep a fair amount of your processor
48:35 power because our processors go in a
48:36 circle right we do have independent
48:38 processors in our
48:40 our bodies so multitasking is capable
48:43 but it's not capable with a sink with a
48:46 single processor there's a lot of books
48:48 out there trying to demonize the notion
48:50 that you can multitask well let's think
48:52 about it I have a very good friend of
48:55 mine he's a world-famous drummer he can
48:58 drum and talk to me at the same time no
49:01 problem when a drummer drums and sings
49:05 along like the drummer of believe the
49:08 romantics he's still in one body of
49:11 thought on this beat is making it
49:13 possible for me to find out where I'm
49:15 gonna sing lyrics on top of this song ok
49:18 Phil Collins had that too right but
49:20 there are these guys you could you could
49:22 talk to Phil Collins he could play any
49:25 one of the songs that he's written on
49:26 the drums and you could have a
49:27 conversation with him he'd be fine
49:29 answering all your questions that's
49:32 because he's got a processor that is
49:33 muscle memory back cerebellum drumming
49:37 and then he's got a consciousness
49:38 frontal lobe system that's talking to me
49:40 but in terms of me saying think about
49:43 two frontal lobe things and then do
49:45 something else with your body that's
49:48 like playing guitar with your with your
49:50 one of your extremities that is not
49:53 possible and so when we have all of our
49:57 rooms full your brain if it's to
50:00 consider those rooms has to go in a
50:02 round robin that's how we program video
50:04 games multiplayer video games it goes in
50:05 a round robin and updates everyone's
50:08 come everyone's computer with what's
50:10 going on a particular room I think what
50:14 I need to say about about these rooms is
50:18 the following we are going to need to
50:21 have sort of a minimum amount of
50:23 resources that we devote to any one of
50:27 the conspiracies that we're thinking to
50:29 really flush it out with all of the
50:31 power that we have the best way to
50:34 orient this is probably to empty out
50:36 virtually all your rooms put back your
50:39 strategic rooms that need to exist so
50:41 you can live a normal life and then try
50:44 to try to focus your efforts on a
50:47 particular conspiracy and then dive deep
50:49 super deep the other big one is
50:53 like I said in the other video entitled
50:56 what if you're wrong
50:57 you have to be willing to be wrong and
51:01 who the hell likes that do you want a
51:04 big detailed discussion on that go see
51:05 that episode try to repeat it here but
51:09 what this technique will give you is
51:11 your maximum faculties to to discern
51:14 information that comes in now we all
51:19 know because I think there's very few of
51:21 you if you're into conspiracies of any
51:23 kind there are very few of you that just
51:25 analyze one conspiracy you are digesting
51:29 a tremendous number of conspiracies at
51:32 any one particular time and based on the
51:36 feedback from YouTube people who are
51:38 making videos about a particular subject
51:39 they die off they ramp up and they die
51:42 off you know I have tried to keep an eye
51:46 on you know the Flat Earth thing and all
51:49 I hear is a bunch of regurgitated stuff
51:52 nowadays and and that's a bad thing what
51:55 that kind of signals is that those who
51:58 exposed what they believe to be true
52:00 have done such an exhaustive job trying
52:04 to prove it that they've kind of outdone
52:07 themselves and all the proofs that they
52:09 believe prove it are on the table
52:11 you know they hopefully everyone
52:13 understands that at least a few of them
52:15 are wrong you know in terms of well the
52:17 sea looks really flat to me and there's
52:18 no way the sea curves go see my episode
52:21 on gravity to understand all that what
52:23 might work in the opposite direction but
52:26 I want to discuss one of the paradoxes
52:28 with conspiracies in general which is
52:31 the defense mechanism that we've
52:33 discussed several times on this show but
52:35 since we're right here it's it's really
52:37 it's good to mention it right now to
52:38 think this thing through one of the
52:42 common defense mechanisms besides asking
52:44 the reason why and trying to isolate a
52:46 motive which is always the most
52:48 challenging is the notion that a bunch
52:52 of people have to participate to keep
52:53 conspiracies going now what's
52:56 interesting one of the benefactors of or
53:00 for us benefits for us with things like
53:03 climate change formerly global warming
53:05 right it only got changed cuz they were
53:06 foolish
53:08 was that we now have proof proof beyond
53:11 any shadow of a doubt that science
53:13 doesn't really matter you know the head
53:17 meteorologist MIT has just recently come
53:20 back out ten years after he made the
53:22 participate in the creating of the movie
53:24 the great global warming swindle and
53:26 reaffirmed his position that it's crap
53:29 how could a guy be a PhD level
53:32 meteorologist at MIT and be wrong how's
53:35 that even possible
53:36 right there's not a lot of moving parts
53:39 when you get down to his level he sees
53:41 the entire ecosystem of the greenhouse
53:43 gas layer which is 99.9 percent water
53:46 and he understands the co2 is negligible
53:49 in the atmosphere and that's all the co2
53:52 made by you know volcanoes dying mass in
53:56 the oceans cow farts and everything that
53:58 we do as human beings negligible point
54:01 zero five four percent of a single
54:03 percent a five hundred and fortieth of a
54:05 single percent is is the amount of co2
54:08 in the greenhouse gas they're nothing
54:11 but now look at the world look how many
54:16 people are buying into this [ __ ] and
54:19 let's just take the sample of people
54:21 that are very devout who have never done
54:23 a single iota of research into it
54:25 they're unwilling to hear a dissenting
54:27 voice and their tail grabbing they feel
54:30 like they're in the tribe the winning
54:33 team there's nothing you can do to
54:35 convince them to consider not to be a
54:37 part of that team now I want to say I
54:40 would have complete respect for someone
54:41 who says well I know it's fake but I
54:44 think the world needs to be depopulated
54:45 so I'm supporting this alternate fake
54:48 agenda to get the world depopulated hey
54:50 if that's what you believe at least I
54:52 respect the fact that you know what's
54:54 going on and we simply differ on the
54:57 density of world population you probably
55:00 wouldn't get me to argue that China
55:02 should go down by properly half a
55:04 billion in so should India I think India
55:06 can go down nearly a billion I mean I
55:09 don't want even anyone to be murdered or
55:11 killed or anything like that but just
55:12 it's regulating birth realizes if two
55:14 people have two children the world's
55:17 population doesn't increase if two have
55:19 one the
55:20 brought the real population down
55:22 relative to their ability by half you
55:24 know so those techniques are deep
55:28 populating the world that don't hurt
55:30 existing humans on earth right so the
55:35 big the moon mission is a very
55:36 interesting one because you know people
55:39 believe that thousands and thousands of
55:42 people would have to be in on the
55:43 conspiracy well just like the Hadron
55:45 Collider built by CERN you have ten
55:48 thousand human beings participating in
55:50 the daily operations and construction of
55:52 that particular machine the biggest
55:55 machine that mankind has ever built
55:57 right someone out there listening has
56:00 been an electrician you've been in some
56:02 former construction some of you been in
56:04 in science your scientists formerly
56:06 scientists well you mean to tell me if
56:09 someone wanted to pay you a six-figure
56:11 salary now you're going to get a
56:13 contract to build one of the largest
56:14 machines on earth you're gonna sit there
56:16 and contest its objective
56:17 if the outward press is that it's one of
56:21 the greatest thing since sliced bread no
56:22 you're gonna take the money you're gonna
56:24 build the object you don't have time for
56:27 conspiracies you're just gonna put stuff
56:30 together you don't care so a ton of
56:34 these people that are supposedly
56:35 required to be in on the conspiracy
56:37 aren't actually required to be in on the
56:40 conspiracy and so anyone throwing
56:42 numbers around in generalizations is
56:44 just putting up a smoke screen for their
56:46 own frailty inside their hearts for the
56:49 moon missions it's all about patriotism
56:51 don't tell me we didn't go the moon
56:53 because that takes away my usurp ssin of
56:56 being a man and man made it to the moon
56:59 so I'm stealing all this victory for my
57:02 own edification what the black pigeon
57:06 guy says is the foundation theory for
57:09 NASA the foundation theory for NASA is
57:12 they went to the moon and they are
57:15 [ __ ] top dogs man now again like I've
57:20 said in previous episodes they have some
57:22 of the most brilliant people on earth
57:23 working for that organization it's just
57:25 again left brain versus right brain
57:27 really calls out how easily it is to
57:31 manipulate these individuals the more
57:33 right brain of scientists
57:34 the more they think outside the box and
57:35 they can see that they might be getting
57:37 manipulated to create a smokescreen for
57:40 something but don't forget that there's
57:43 a lot of rationales that can be told to
57:44 a human being to get them to go along
57:48 just say look we're gonna fake this
57:49 thing of the moon but it's really just
57:50 to outdo the Russkies to get rid of
57:52 communism isn't that a good thing and
57:53 think about all the kids that are gonna
57:55 get into science as a result of this
57:56 because they're inspired by this
57:58 you gotta Yatta Yatta and someone goes
58:00 yeah you know okay alright what else am
58:03 I gonna do you know I'm a scientist and
58:05 these are the only people that employ
58:06 scientists I guess I just got to go
58:08 along with the flow and hey this will be
58:09 exciting and I if I go along with a
58:12 conspiracy I get to visit high schools
58:13 for us to my life saying I help
58:15 participate in the in the moon landings
58:18 right so if you think about that mindset
58:22 and someone being convinced to go along
58:24 with the conspiracy for whatever reason
58:26 someone is assisting with these
58:27 chemtrails being sprayed all over the
58:28 planet again in non commercial flight
58:31 areas on days when you know it's blazing
58:34 hot all over California when they're
58:36 trying to convince us that the thermals
58:37 going up there are ice cold to create
58:40 you know trails to turn into clouds
58:42 right I point out a chem show and I go
58:43 what is that oh that's a contrail 20
58:46 minutes later I point the same exact
58:47 thing in the sky and someone says it's a
58:48 cloud the greatest experiment you can do
58:53 for yourself to shake out any doubt that
58:56 these things are real clouds are not
59:00 made from the back of planes just a
59:02 little shout out there so as we are
59:05 trying to sift out what is fake and what
59:07 is real we have essentially operatives
59:11 that are creating these conspiracies for
59:13 greedy control mechanisms in most cases
59:16 all right again greed greed conspiracies
59:20 are like GE lost the patent to a light
59:24 bulb a long time ago and so they went to
59:26 Congress and said look we're gonna
59:28 create this green movement [ __ ]
59:29 we're gonna make a bunch of mercury
59:30 filled crappy bulbs that actually spend
59:32 more power than a normal incandescent
59:34 light bulb we're gonna propagandize the
59:37 [ __ ] out of this and everyone's going to
59:39 have to buy our patented light bulb and
59:41 therefore we control the industry again
59:43 we legislate it into existence
59:45 DuPont
59:46 lost its patent for freon in the early
59:49 80s lobbied Congress for about eight
59:51 years to forbid freon from being used
59:55 why because dupont wanted to have patent
59:59 control and slash money control over
60:02 what people were using to cool down
60:03 their cars and refrigerators etc and so
60:06 now we have this replacement they
60:09 financed the replacement through
60:11 legislation they are the ones that
60:14 demonized remember the whole ozone layer
60:16 scare in the late 80s early 90s it was
60:19 all a manipulation of facts to justify a
60:24 multi-billion dollar industry which is
60:27 coolant that goes inside
60:29 you know refrigerators and air
60:31 conditioners right so if you think about
60:35 trying to find the truth and especially
60:38 for those of you been on the journey for
60:39 a long time you know it's sort of like
60:43 going into a mosh pit and the name of
60:47 the game and a mosh pit is the toughest
60:49 guy gets to go anywhere he wants the guy
60:52 weighs the most the guy is the most fit
60:54 can knock everyone out of the mosh pit
60:57 because it's not really a fight you
60:59 don't necessarily punch a guy in the jaw
61:01 and knock him out with his glass jaw you
61:03 just go in there and get bumped around
61:05 I've seen some brutal [ __ ] and mosh pits
61:08 in my lifetime that's sort of how it is
61:11 to try and find the truth again if you
61:14 get close to the truth you get killed
61:16 you know if you're finding a new truth
61:19 it isn't out there all over the place
61:20 what's beautiful about YouTube and and
61:24 generally any medium that can help
61:26 incubate doubt in something that seems
61:28 suspicious is that now we're the first
61:32 people that came out on YouTube that
61:34 were really exposing conspiracies we're
61:38 getting visits by the government they
61:40 were disappearing they were dying and
61:42 nowadays you know if Stan Myers had
61:44 really endorsed the internet and used it
61:47 as a mechanism to publish his findings
61:49 he probably would be alive today if he
61:52 didn't go for money he'd be alive today
61:55 but instead he was holding out and
61:57 holding out holding out trying to make
61:59 it a business and you know
62:00 you understand why he did what he did
62:02 because he had he was brilliant he
62:04 invented a car that ran on tap water you
62:07 know but like I've always said if you
62:10 create a zero-point energy system and
62:11 you hold it for money you're gonna die
62:13 you're gonna find you and they're gonna
62:14 kill you but if you just release the
62:17 recipe to the world on how to make it
62:18 with a schematic that is so simple and
62:21 safe and it gets around all the
62:23 regulations and all that stuff and
62:25 everyone can go to RadioShack and
62:27 Walmart or whatever and buy the pieces
62:29 to get this thing built tell me where
62:33 you're gonna have to pay for anything in
62:35 life let's just this what would you do
62:38 if you saved it and you made billions
62:40 and billions of dollars
62:42 what is the freedom you get from the
62:43 billion dollars well you go anywhere you
62:45 want you never have to work again in
62:46 your life you get to do the maximum
62:49 amount of things that a human being can
62:51 do on this planet because you can pay
62:53 for it okay but you make a zero point
62:56 energy system that that powers every
62:58 restaurant every cruise ship every plane
63:00 in the world you mean to tell me you got
63:04 to pay for anything I don't think so you
63:07 walk into a restaurant go I'm the reason
63:09 why you don't have to pay for
63:10 electricity mind if I have a meal
63:12 [ __ ] yeah can I take my picture with you
63:14 at the same time can I say that the
63:16 inventor of zero-point energy came into
63:18 my restaurant there's no reason to
63:21 killing you because everyone already has
63:22 it someone might kill you out of spite
63:24 the other net there's no point in it at
63:26 all you feel me right go back to our
63:32 moshpit analogy everyone in the mosh pit
63:35 that's coming after you is trying to
63:39 protect their perception of the world
63:41 right don't tell me the world isn't the
63:44 way it is I've worked really hard maybe
63:46 to come up with this can this this
63:48 concept of how the world works I don't
63:52 hear about your dinosaur thing I was
63:53 telling a good friend of mine about the
63:55 dinosaur thing because he was mentioning
63:57 dinosaurs and using it as a stepping
63:58 stone another piece of information I
64:00 said well you know dude I'm not sure I
64:01 believe that they ever existed and I
64:03 gave him and he was sitting next to his
64:05 wife and I started mentioning the the
64:07 theory about you know the Eric Dubay
64:09 presented last year and she was like
64:13 I've heard of that
64:14 that and its really compelling to to
64:16 think that maybe we've been duped and he
64:17 just literally turned to me and said
64:19 what a few firm friends of mine have
64:20 said which is stop talking stop talking
64:24 I don't want to hear any more I have I
64:26 don't want you to interfere with my love
64:28 for dinosaurs now he was kind of joking
64:30 when he said that but he is also
64:31 revealing the truth inside his heart and
64:34 so again you know in this show I always
64:36 say don't ever try to push stuff on
64:38 people that don't want to hear it let
64:40 them let them find their own way it's
64:43 just like trying to convince someone to
64:44 change their habits in the world they
64:47 have to change because they want to and
64:49 that's the same thing for conspiracies
64:51 in general right I think one of the
64:54 things that helps and again we're gonna
64:57 get into the backside of really
64:59 dementing our minds at the same time
65:02 because people don't talk about that
65:03 very often which is to finish up before
65:06 we jump into that you have to understand
65:10 the methods of attack I think most of
65:12 you are hip on that but the methods of
65:14 attack you're being called names without
65:16 any you know counter evidence some
65:18 people make these videos that are well
65:20 very well researched they're doing their
65:23 best to parse a particular truth right
65:26 or conspiracy and people will go in and
65:30 say tinfoil hat you know tinfoil hat for
65:32 me any time you hear that comment made
65:35 it's a bot that's been built by the Army
65:37 Corps psyops to ridicule you there's an
65:40 AI that's in there they don't have to
65:42 say anything but tinfoil hat tinfoil hat
65:45 you know if you could look up all their
65:47 comments they've made on other videos
65:49 I'm going to bet those accounts have
65:50 millions of tinfoil hat comments that
65:53 are probably cut and paste identical
65:56 passages and it's just to shake you a
65:58 little bit it's to make you go oh my god
66:00 am i nuts you know once you start
66:04 feeling the pattern of attacks it starts
66:08 to become you become numb to it you
66:11 become deaf to it you're no longer
66:13 manipulated by it and you you March on
66:17 now let's jump over to the other side
66:20 because this is something we don't
66:21 really want to acknowledge that often
66:24 what are the chances that that the
66:27 official stories are all true
66:28 and that through some manipulation by
66:33 perhaps dark forces we believe
66:36 conspiracies because they have fed us a
66:39 bunch of misinformation disinformation
66:41 you know when when you really think
66:44 about I'll give you an example this is a
66:48 fictitious example so please don't pass
66:51 this around as I heard this and this is
66:52 true I can tell you right now that it
66:55 would be relatively inexpensive I would
67:00 say that what I'm about to say would
67:02 probably cost if you were to go to a
67:06 special effects house here in Los
67:09 Angeles probably definitely less than
67:11 ten million dollars to model Dallas
67:15 Texas on the day that Kennedy was shot
67:18 model every single person that's been in
67:21 every single photograph model Kennedy
67:23 himself the car everything the grassy
67:27 knoll every leaf on every tree roll the
67:32 scenario you know animate the whole
67:33 thing according to what really happened
67:35 and then twist and turn characters to do
67:39 things that they never did the the
67:41 driver of the car looks like he's
67:43 looking back at Kennedy with a gun in
67:45 his hand as the last resort to kill this
67:48 guy but the kid in the range ring shot
67:51 him in the head right not the grassy
67:53 knoll but the rain during the 18 year
67:54 old kid that disappeared after he went
67:56 back to his work covered in [ __ ] hadn't
67:58 helped hidden a bathroom for 45 minutes
68:00 at his gas station job they called the
68:02 cops on him he was hauled away and I
68:04 never saw the kid again right but
68:06 because all the footage of that day was
68:09 taken on you know 18 millimeter 16
68:12 millimeter cameras most eight I think by
68:14 pedestrians with their cameras you could
68:18 then render this whole thing with a 8
68:21 millimeter distortion filter in your
68:23 package and then all the details and
68:25 anomalies that we see in the transformer
68:28 movies Pacific Rim you don't see any of
68:30 those details because it's as low res as
68:33 possible that takes a lot of heat off
68:35 the artist to make this thing perfect
68:37 they can do whatever they want with the
68:39 action re-release it they could claim
68:41 anything then they could also create
68:43 back channels of documentation
68:45 testimonies and all kinds of stuff to
68:47 make us believe a conspiracy that
68:50 doesn't really exist again that's a
68:53 fictitious example that doesn't never
68:55 hurt anything like that be real I was
68:58 involved in well my game company we were
69:01 approached by a company in Hollywood
69:04 that had a Declassified piece of
69:06 software from the Central Intelligence
69:08 Agency that it did photo real faces and
69:11 you could film my face but all the
69:13 tracking dots on it I moved my face they
69:16 do post processes to make it absolutely
69:18 perfect but I'm gonna tell you right now
69:20 you couldn't tell the difference between
69:22 what they rendered in the end and in
69:25 reality there was and I have a very
69:27 educated eye on this you know I I see
69:31 the the when I watch an animated face
69:33 for instance I can see all the motion
69:36 anomalies of a mouth of all the muscles
69:39 in the face I mean it's just buoyantly
69:40 obvious these things are fake like Kevin
69:43 bridges being rear-ended as clew and
69:47 young Kevin bridges or I should say
69:50 young Keith Kevin Flynn excuse me in
69:52 Tron Legacy you can just see the mouth
69:54 does not move real time properly
69:56 guarding the galaxies too they aged back
69:59 Kurt Russell pretty damn good job but
70:01 still you have some motion problems it
70:03 doesn't move as fast as the normal mouth
70:06 moves and that's because they can't
70:08 afford to hand animate every single
70:11 frame they've got to be rely on rigging
70:13 systems so we know that fake photographs
70:17 have been created there were some fake
70:19 photographs created brilliant fake
70:22 photographs created about a summa bin
70:24 Laden hanging out with some some other
70:26 you know al Qaeda guy and eventually the
70:30 BBC had to say yeah we had this actually
70:32 this photograph made fake for some other
70:36 thing that we were doing that was not
70:38 trying to claim it was fact but the
70:39 photograph got picked up circulated
70:41 around the world as a true association
70:43 between these guys when it was just a
70:44 theory that these two guys met but we
70:46 created this photograph with them
70:47 together and they got busted
70:50 so can we be creating sort of a mental
70:57 health problem for ourselves I think the
71:01 answer is akan equivocally yes and I
71:05 will tell you that no one really will
71:08 want to admit this but I'm gonna admit
71:10 it myself
71:11 having spent the majority of the last
71:13 probably I'd say 14 years researching
71:18 all this subdermal stuff kicked off by
71:22 Michael Rupert's video he made and I
71:25 believe November of 2001 where he went
71:29 to Oregon University and gave a lecture
71:30 about some of the underpinnings of 9/11
71:35 from there on to today you know I'm open
71:39 I'm really open to different things and
71:42 conspiracies of all kinds and you know
71:45 some are real easy but what ends up
71:47 happening is it so oils the machine to
71:49 doubt reality that there will be things
71:51 that are absolutely not conspiracies in
71:54 your own personal life you know you'll
71:56 fear a business partners going down a
71:58 weird path and they're not it feels like
72:04 they are but because you have all these
72:06 conspiracy circuits in your brain you
72:07 can't think clearly so it's very
72:09 important that we regulate on a
72:11 conscious basis this mechanism of our
72:15 brain your brain is a machine right it's
72:19 a real machine and it processes things
72:21 based on rules and things that have
72:24 benefited us in the past right we lose
72:27 face with relatives and friends on
72:30 occasion because we go down too deep we
72:33 get excited you know my biggest
72:35 challenge is that I have a fairly
72:39 photographic memory and I it took me a
72:42 long time to figure out how to interact
72:44 with my photograph photographic memory
72:46 and how it builds the images in my brain
72:49 and you know I was a kid that really
72:51 loathed history I just didn't like to
72:54 study it when I was a kid and it's
72:55 really because the teachers were just
72:58 [ __ ] boring as can be just you know
73:01 the progression progressive movement
73:04 eighteen hunters and never made it
73:07 exciting and so I had this hodgepodge II
73:10 kind of impersonation of history in my
73:13 brain even if I'd studied I think I
73:15 would have had pretty bad history in my
73:16 brain but when I woke up it was I had
73:20 the tools then to look at reality and
73:22 make connections and make
73:23 cause-and-effect models make sense in my
73:25 brain and so my problem is is that when
73:30 someone opens up on a subject because of
73:32 the show because of my research because
73:34 of my memory I can at least exhibit what
73:39 I have collected over the years about a
73:42 particular subject in great detail dates
73:44 people places and you know I'm still
73:46 just scratching the surface in most
73:48 cases
73:49 I envy folks that take deep dives into
73:51 single subjects and when I listen to
73:53 them talk about conspiracies and they've
73:56 got like I have friends of mine that
73:57 study hillary clinton's actions in the
74:00 clinton family and my god you sit and
74:02 listen to them go on and on and on
74:04 connecting dots all the way from their
74:06 college years to today and all the
74:07 people that have died who've gotten
74:09 close to their circle all their
74:12 investments all of their the state
74:14 department things that hillary did and
74:16 things the Clintons did I mean it's
74:18 phenomenal to hear these stories but I
74:20 don't have that information you know
74:22 I've just got loose impressions of them
74:25 because I don't find them to be that
74:28 interesting personally you know but we
74:32 have to check ourselves every once in a
74:33 while to make sure we don't go nuts in
74:36 this whole thing and you know I don't
74:38 hear many people talking about it if any
74:40 people talking about it to be honest and
74:43 so let's let's insert that into our
74:46 daily process if you're going to do a
74:49 round robin on a bunch of conscious
74:50 ideas and visiting all the sockets in
74:52 your mind there might be a good well
74:58 this is probably a really good value of
75:00 sticking that evaluation process of all
75:03 your sockets just to make sure every
75:04 time you do a loop on your brain you're
75:07 asking questions about your own sanity
75:10 and you know whether or not you're
75:12 taking it too far and carry that
75:15 mechanism to all the other sockets that
75:17 are
75:17 in debate what I don't think we want to
75:20 actually admit is that there's a rhyme
75:26 to this reason that somehow the world
75:30 runs on conspiracies otherwise it can't
75:33 function and I you know if I said to you
75:37 look a marketing department is the
75:39 single simplest aboveboard conspiracy
75:42 department in the world because people
75:45 are trying to convince you to buy things
75:46 you don't need they're exacerbating your
75:49 suffering so you buy Drano or mr. clean
75:52 or whatever you're like you know okay
75:57 that's true and then that adds a means
76:00 to an ends right it is the method by
76:03 which all these departments run if you
76:04 came into a a marketing department to
76:07 get a job fresh out of college and you
76:09 said hey man you know let's let's let's
76:12 just be honest about our product you
76:14 know it is better than the competition
76:15 and it does smell good blah blah blah
76:17 you would be out of a job in two seconds
76:20 they want to hear vicious push push push
76:24 algorithms of get creative let's let's
76:28 manipulate the mind in ways that it's
76:30 never been manipulated to increase sales
76:32 and then the company pays us higher and
76:34 higher salaries and bonuses every year
76:36 because we're moving product right so
76:41 the one thing I want to leave you with
76:42 is something I've said in several
76:46 episodes since season one but it's
76:49 something that I think we need to be
76:51 reminded of often and you're going to
76:56 have probably a knee-jerk response
76:59 against this notion but let me encourage
77:02 you to stick take a deep breath count to
77:05 10 and then think about this theory
77:08 again to see if you can't come up with
77:09 some form of understanding what I'm
77:12 saying and I'm not trying to let your
77:15 intelligence I'm just trying to say if
77:17 you're focused on some pretty dark stuff
77:19 what I'm about to say may be
77:22 counterintuitive all right
77:25 it is my solemn belief that 99% of this
77:31 world if not 0.999 carry the nine
77:34 several digits out of the seven and a
77:38 half billion people where you supposedly
77:39 have on this planet that everyone is
77:43 good nobody wants a war you know Joseph
77:48 gurbles said it best you know you said
77:50 there's nothing to gain by the
77:51 individual for going to war because the
77:55 war means you could lose your life and
77:57 lose everything that you own and it's
77:59 the propaganda that Joseph Goebbels
78:01 perfected in this last century him being
78:05 really a super late comer to the idea of
78:07 propaganda right titus flavius is one of
78:09 the geniuses of it all but the idea is
78:12 you know how many times have we heard
78:15 friends that have traveled around the
78:17 world and they come back and say my gosh
78:19 the people were so gracious and so
78:21 wonderful I don't get a lot of that from
78:24 people go to France but Asia everyone
78:28 I've ever talked to that has gone to
78:30 Asia as a normal tourist who's meeting
78:33 these individuals they come back with
78:36 these just enchanting stories of how
78:38 wonderful the people were people go to
78:41 South America people even go to the
78:43 Middle East you know as long as they're
78:46 respectful of the culture they wear the
78:49 right clothing does Middle East has a
78:51 lot of rules about your clothing as long
78:53 as you you know I'm not talking about a
78:55 woman having you know a first-world
78:57 woman having to wear a burka they
78:58 understand why First Rule women wear
79:01 less clothing but you know we have a lot
79:05 of you know from every single race
79:06 including every race white race or
79:09 whatever they we always have some bad
79:11 apples right and you'll run into them
79:13 but it's not indicative of usually a
79:15 giant population those are on the
79:18 warpath for various religious movements
79:22 involved with war and people being
79:25 inferior to other people well they're
79:27 they're the exception there that other
79:28 percent that teeny tiny percent even if
79:32 you want to think there's ten million
79:33 people out there that want to destroy
79:34 the world will divide it by seven and a
79:36 half billion and that's your percentage
79:38 of people
79:39 that want the world to burn it's a very
79:41 tiny percent it's a fraction of a single
79:43 percent to be quite honest right which
79:45 carries the nine out and are 99 percent
79:49 algorithm here so the reason why I
79:55 mention that is the following if you can
79:57 get on board with the notion that 99
79:59 percent of the population of this planet
80:02 wants nothing but peace and serenity and
80:05 sovereignty and they just want to be
80:06 left alone then the way that you process
80:10 conspiracies and who's involved and what
80:12 the motives are starts to refine
80:14 beautifully it doesn't mean that
80:16 innocent people can't be pulled into a
80:17 conspiracy and even forced into
80:20 conspiracies right at gunpoint and some
80:22 sort and they go along with it simply
80:24 because it's do or die to be honest well
80:28 we have to have a little
80:30 get-out-of-jail-free card for some of
80:32 these people if they can prove that
80:33 that's what happened to them well we can
80:36 prove that's what happened to them right
80:38 but the other existential side of this
80:40 whole game is if you believe in an
80:42 afterlife of any kind if you're along if
80:46 you if you're willing to come along with
80:48 me and believe in reincarnation see the
80:51 reincarnation episode then what the
80:53 world is is a very interesting
80:55 experiment if we are all visiting this
81:01 like a West world but we're all guests
81:04 we're not hosts but perhaps the world as
81:08 a host the universe is a host then we
81:13 are merely passing through this train
81:15 station trying to do what we can before
81:18 we die to refine the algorithm of this
81:22 this physical entity that is mankind
81:25 some of that will take the burden off if
81:28 you can get on board with that I'll take
81:29 the burden off of this impending doom if
81:32 you're not able to change the entire
81:33 world in your lifetime I understand a
81:37 lot of you want to see that happen and
81:38 I'm one of them right I want to see
81:40 globalism fail horribly and I want every
81:44 single [ __ ] who does it to be
81:46 caught
81:46 through defection through millions of
81:51 millions of julian assange is coming out
81:54 and saying look i think we're done with
81:56 this i'm no longer willing to go along
81:58 with it and you know it's a bunch of
82:00 deep throat releases of information to
82:03 get the ball rolling which we're seeing
82:04 now but in the end you know we have a
82:08 bunch of demented people who have
82:11 demented minds non empathetic non
82:14 sympathetic self-serving super greedy
82:17 they have had it bred all good things
82:20 bred out of them and all evil things
82:21 bred in them and so it's a virus it is
82:26 literally a virus if you take mankind as
82:29 a ecosystem of life this is a virus that
82:32 is sort of eating away at us at the same
82:36 time like I've said several times you
82:39 know we celebrate heroes because of war
82:44 you know we got a movie was about a
82:46 sniper who went to the Middle East and
82:48 killed what you know 165 people or
82:51 something like that is this confirmed
82:53 kill count or something like that and we
82:54 Revere this guy for killing all these
82:56 people all right can you prove to me
82:59 everyone deserve to die really then we
83:02 have heroes because an iron catches on
83:05 fire and starts a apartment fire house
83:08 fire and a fireman or just a citizen
83:11 walking by runs in there and saves a
83:13 baby saves a puppy same as a mother or
83:15 father whatever for me I prefer to have
83:18 the latter form of hero than the former
83:22 someone being manipulated in their mind
83:25 to believe in propaganda to rationalize
83:27 killing people that they don't undertake
83:29 their language for God's sakes they're
83:31 killing them right there was a funny
83:33 video I'm gonna close on buddy might
83:36 impose the video of this kid sitting on
83:39 a porch and he was talking about how
83:43 hard he was how much of a thug he was
83:45 and how hard he rolls and on video I
83:48 don't know if it's a if it's a fictional
83:50 video it was really well done if this
83:52 was fake but you know what happens these
83:55 kids are brilliant with these little
83:56 short videos but a friend walked up to
83:58 him and said okay you know we got to go
84:00 and he looks at him he's kids off-camera
84:03 you never see this kid ask
84:04 questions but it keeps the camera on
84:06 himself perfectly which sort of suggests
84:08 maybe it's a setup but it's a beautiful
84:10 example and the guy says to him we we
84:13 have to go do something and in a really
84:17 short exchange the kid says you know
84:19 what is it and it really comes down to
84:20 shooting someone there their gang has
84:22 determined that they've got to go shoot
84:24 somebody and the kids said no not me men
84:27 and he goes I don't know what this guy
84:30 is done I'm not gonna shoot somebody I
84:32 don't have any you know rationale for
84:34 what he's done you don't even know what
84:36 he's done do you but you're gonna go
84:38 shoot somebody goes you're on your own
84:39 man you can get 25 to life for killing
84:42 somebody I don't want any part of that
84:43 he sits back down this is after giving
84:45 his monologue about how tough he is
84:47 which good for him I hope this thing's
84:49 real but regardless if it's real or fake
84:53 the beauty of it was the kid thought for
84:56 himself
84:58 unlike unfortunately young kids who are
85:03 patriotic they joined the military and
85:05 they get told a bunch of stuff that may
85:07 or may not be true you know I think most
85:10 of us are mature now that we don't blame
85:12 astronauts for perhaps participating in
85:15 the and the hoax of going to the moon
85:17 they're in a gunpoint literally a kid
85:20 who's a patriot is still a patriot even
85:23 if he does things that are dumb based on
85:26 being told things that are lies
85:28 he's still good person or she's a good
85:31 person there's still the best of the
85:33 breed that we have in this country to
85:35 defend this country it's just they've
85:36 been sold something or something's been
85:39 incubated under false pretenses and now
85:42 there is a reaction
85:43 and they're actually solving the actual
85:45 threat the bummer is that it was started
85:47 in the first place right so we don't
85:49 need to disrespect astronauts we don't
85:50 need to disrespect soldiers for getting
85:52 duped into something but we're soldiers
85:54 too in the war for truth and this is
85:59 where I think we expand the conversation
86:02 we expand the the insights into
86:05 information such that we more more often
86:08 operate on the most sane algorithms we
86:12 can find which is why we have to have
86:14 shows like this and other shows that
86:16 don't just present
86:17 Pharisees but dive behind the curtain
86:19 and we're willing to talk about the
86:21 metaphysics of how our brains work so
86:23 that we can have more faculties and more
86:26 analysis and not be so quick to jump on
86:31 board with things I know a bunch of you
86:34 probably moved in really fast like me
86:36 into conspiracies and you had no one
86:37 around to help you none of your family
86:40 or friends were in on this stuff and
86:41 you're just like watching 12 hours of
86:43 videos every day but today so you've
86:46 been doing this for a decade yeah they
86:49 could be doing it for a couple years and
86:51 you gain perspective so I'm pretty sure
86:56 you feel me on this one what is fake
86:59 well we're all gonna find out one day
87:01 hopefully right I think what's
87:04 interesting about the notion of an
87:06 afterlife in with this current climate
87:09 in our world today is that usually most
87:12 of us subscribe if there isn't any sort
87:14 of afterlife not that it will
87:16 essentially or not that it will matter
87:18 to us once we leave this planet if we in
87:21 indeed actually exit the planet as a
87:23 soul of some sort but we all kind of
87:27 think I think in most cases that there's
87:28 some sort of access to truth once we
87:32 transcend again we don't want all the
87:36 truth trust me you don't want to be God
87:38 you know we want mystery we want choice
87:42 and that kind of stuff so partial truth
87:44 allows that to continue to exist if
87:47 there truly is an afterlife in the end I
87:51 think even if you can contribute to a
87:55 single piece of truth being exposed to
87:57 your friends and family or the world
87:59 through whatever means you have
88:00 necessary even if there's no afterlife
88:03 you will have made your tribe the human
88:07 race better by spreading this stuff out
88:10 there perhaps putting some in a time
88:12 capsule just in case they try to reset
88:14 the world it can be found somewhere
88:16 right but I think man's man's devotion
88:19 to sovereignty and free will is absolute
88:22 and I think that because of that
88:25 absolute nature we will always prevail
88:28 on the end it just may not happen on our
88:30 watch or as quickly as we'd like deep
88:35 thoughts radio.com for all the feeds
