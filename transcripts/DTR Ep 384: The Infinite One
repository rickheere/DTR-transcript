00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen tonight I'm gonna push the
00:40 odds because they say it's gonna rain in
00:41 about an hour and so I looked at the
00:45 radar and there are a lot of clouds
00:47 north of here going north and so I think
00:50 we're safe but had to run away from two
00:52 storms in the last couple months here
00:56 but tonight's topic is the infinite one
01:00 tonight's topic is a heavy concept that
01:04 I have mentioned several times on
01:05 different shows but I think it's time we
01:07 just go for it
01:09 and it has to do with the notion and
01:16 what's interesting is this is sort of a
01:18 paradox whole thing to say and some of
01:20 you might blow over it unless you slow
01:22 down your thinking for just a second and
01:23 realize I don't think this is something
01:26 you should blow over this is not filler
01:28 you know I don't really believe in
01:30 filler if I have any shows the feel like
01:32 filler it's because I've recorded a bad
01:34 show but I never intended to do so and
01:39 we have raindrops of some kind on me so
01:41 I'm going to put a blanket on the
01:44 computer so I'm getting little sprinkles
01:47 on me but all the gear is actually
01:51 outfitted to weather that we'll see I
01:55 jumped out of a show about a week ago
02:00 and then I went out front and it stopped
02:02 raining
02:02 just as fast as it started so well let
02:06 this one go just a little bit longer
02:08 before I totally hang it up but we
02:11 wonder where our souls come from we
02:13 wonder what the logic is to this
02:14 universe and in my opinion it has to do
02:18 with the paradox of counting everything
02:23 how many souls are there where Souls
02:25 come from our souls limited or Souls
02:27 infinite what's our purpose here you
02:33 start thinking about the counting the
02:34 soul thing and it starts to get really
02:36 upside down in your brain
02:40 but there's one little thought that
02:42 solves all the problems and it is that
02:45 we are one we are the infinite one I got
02:55 no rain storm clouds overhead nothing
02:58 but I'm getting [ __ ] sprinkled on so
02:59 I have to set up here some other way
03:01 it's pretty hilarious man just stop
03:04 doing it I got everything covered in
03:06 sheets except for this Mike even the
03:08 cameras got a big blanket on top of it
03:11 don't tell me I don't love you this
03:15 notion hit me probably 20 years ago the
03:18 notion that we are one it didn't come
03:20 from any outside source but I'm sure
03:22 people have been thinking about it for
03:23 years perhaps they knew it a long time
03:27 ago we just lost the knowledge but I
03:31 wrote a song probably 1995 ish 96 when
03:37 the song is called how could I hate you
03:39 and the idea was at that time to me if
03:43 we lived forever then how on earth could
03:46 I hate you you know not that I hated
03:49 anybody in this world but I just was
03:52 trying to kind of put a message out
03:53 there for anybody who easily hates on
03:58 things because if you live forever
04:00 what's the point you know and Princeton
04:04 under the cherry moon had a really
04:06 interesting line one of his things about
04:08 the whole deal was if we live forever
04:11 than life as a parade which is why the
04:15 album that had under the cherry moons
04:18 title track on it was called parade
04:20 I was very interesting but nothing about
04:26 it we live in linear time as our body
04:30 understands this illusion of time and I
04:34 think what's great is that when I
04:35 mentioned time in an episode for all of
04:39 you chronic listeners you know that I
04:41 disclaim it as an illusion of the
04:44 passage of time and you know Douglas
04:47 Adams lunchtime doubly so that whole
04:49 thing but it's because we have memory of
04:51 previous states of our existence
04:53 that we believe that there's time and
04:55 within our own paradigm there is time
04:57 there really is it's an illusion but we
05:00 use it right I was a kid once now I'm an
05:02 adult I'm gonna be an old man one day
05:04 and one day I'll perish you know but the
05:07 idea that we are all the same person at
05:10 different levels of maturity different
05:12 levels of accomplishment it's it's huge
05:19 it solves for the recent paradox that
05:22 I've had a problem with which is where
05:24 do our souls come from how many do we
05:27 have
05:28 does God create them there would seem to
05:32 be a limited amount no matter how you
05:33 did it whether God created everything
05:36 or an alien created everything to be a
05:41 limited amount I believe obviously that
05:44 we have a soul on a different plane of
05:48 unregister a bowl by Machine existence
05:52 we feel souls all day long you know
05:56 again when I say to you okay by the best
05:59 8k television you can hook up the best
06:02 pipe you can on the internet get
06:04 yourself a hundred gig line wired
06:06 directly to your computer and have a
06:07 Skype session with a loved one it's
06:11 crystal clear we're a Bose headset to
06:14 make it even more crystal clear and you
06:17 can have a pretty good conversation like
06:19 that you can have some pretty good
06:19 experience it's like that but you get in
06:22 the same room with that same human being
06:23 and you don't have to say a word and it
06:25 feels better it feels amazing it really
06:28 feels amazing to be with other human
06:31 beings and we have lost that word
06:33 amazing it's extremely important as
06:38 it'll sing and I was taught this as a
06:40 young man
06:42 people who hate themselves can't love
06:45 anyone else and people are mean to
06:48 everyone hate themselves so I'm always
06:51 telling you that if you join a political
06:53 party that's all about the divide and
06:55 division and hatred and feeling
06:58 alienated and blah blah blah they are
07:00 keeping you inside of some and
07:03 you know I would say satanic bubble I
07:06 don't believe in that stuff but it is
07:08 just a nice way of wrapping it up and
07:10 going that's a bad that's a bad state of
07:13 mind you don't want that state of mind
07:16 when you choose to hate somebody for any
07:18 reason dislike them even for a split
07:20 second you're in traffic you're in
07:22 public you're on the phone with the
07:24 telemarketer who's trying to steal money
07:25 from you or you know not even
07:27 telemarketers sorry the the scammers
07:29 from India the scammers from although
07:31 all these other locations India seems to
07:32 have the drop on American scamming they
07:37 have figured it out well what if that's
07:42 you on the other side you won't accept
07:44 that what if we are Ted Bunny the Son of
07:48 Sam
07:48 Charles Manson Adolf Hitler were all
07:51 these people we are the people that
07:54 prospered from a war and were the people
07:56 that suffered and became perhaps extinct
07:59 because of a war we don't really have
08:02 the mind to think about that we don't
08:06 want to think about that and so we don't
08:10 when we keep our sort of blissful
08:12 paradise that we have which is we don't
08:16 know what we are and we simply exist and
08:18 there's really nothing wrong with that
08:19 as well but if you are ynx ting over
08:23 this particular thought of what we are
08:25 you know what are we where are we who
08:28 are we all that good stuff and doesn't
08:31 matter if you think we're in a matrix
08:33 doesn't matter still could be true
08:37 because for me the matrix solves very
08:40 little it explains a little but it
08:43 doesn't solve much because at some point
08:45 if you're in a matrix we're inside some
08:48 tron legacy you know grid doesn't matter
08:51 I just finished watching an episode
08:54 where it's Star Trek next generation
08:57 season six
08:58 it's where the nemesis of Sherlock
09:03 Holmes Moriarty who existed in a episode
09:06 of believe in 89 where he became
09:09 self-aware because data said please give
09:12 me an opponent that is comparable to my
09:14 intelligence and so the AI
09:16 then the computer created Moriarty and
09:18 beef team up and they gave him the
09:21 sentient quality and so then four years
09:24 later they stumble on to his program and
09:26 he pulls some shenanigans so he can
09:30 leave the holodeck but at the end of the
09:35 episode they had to they left it with a
09:39 matrix joke at the end and also let you
09:43 watch it it's brilliant it's like
09:45 literally one of the best episodes it
09:47 has mr. Barkley in it who's just a gym
09:49 and mr. Barkley in any of his episodes
09:51 are very special episodes and its really
09:54 wow this actor he plays a super-duper
09:57 insecure person on the enterprise and
10:01 real life he's obviously very confident
10:04 too accomplished actor but what if we I
10:07 mean this is the way I want to frame
10:10 this whole episode in your brain so that
10:11 while I'm talking you're thinking as
10:13 much as possible about your take on this
10:17 and again if you're in some paradigm of
10:22 religion then your mind potentially is
10:24 locked down and you can't think about
10:25 these subjects you're not allowed to
10:27 think about these subjects because the
10:28 church has told you every single thing
10:31 that is to be and you are relegated to
10:34 min to get your salvation to God you
10:38 must engage in the rules the man-made
10:40 rules right it's unfortunate I mean that
10:44 you would have a shackle on your mind
10:45 that you would adopt and keep your
10:49 morals are a different thing that's what
10:51 you're made out of that your guiding
10:52 principles and that's what churches are
10:55 infinitely good for because they're not
10:57 being taught anywhere else like I said
10:58 many times but now let's say that God
11:02 comes down and visits you doesn't say
11:05 much God's gonna be like a guy doesn't
11:09 really probably get into a heck of a lot
11:10 of small talk so if he's gonna share
11:13 something with you he's gonna get down
11:17 to business real quick and this is sort
11:20 of a paradoxical example because
11:21 pretentious potentially if you believe
11:23 in this then maybe God is us
11:28 and we're not allowed to say that in
11:31 modern religion are we but let's say he
11:34 does he's this other being maybe he's
11:37 the guy that never comes in he's always
11:39 the guy on the outside he's us on the
11:41 outside constantly but he comes in and
11:44 tells you you are one that's all he says
11:49 and then he leaves and then you're stuck
11:55 with this imperative truth that you
11:57 don't quite understand and a good
12:01 teacher would never give you absolutely
12:05 everything without giving you some sort
12:07 of chance to have an example like if you
12:09 learn how to well put this way you go to
12:13 class then your learning had an oil
12:15 paint your teachers a great oil painter
12:18 but you're going to learn to become a
12:20 great oil painter that's why you're
12:21 there but your teacher just says watch
12:23 and the teacher paints a photo photo a
12:26 real painting however long it takes in
12:29 fact they're they're quick because they
12:30 have all the tricks so they don't make
12:32 any mistake so potentially it painted
12:33 this painting they're gonna paint for
12:35 you for every class they've ever taught
12:36 so now they just do it by memory okay
12:41 now you go home you've seen the lesson
12:46 of how to be a great teacher but you
12:48 never painted and that's us never
12:50 thinking but being given all the answers
12:56 there's a point in everyone's life where
12:58 you are in grade school and you've
13:02 learned to do basic arithmetic and then
13:05 you get the chance to go to college and
13:07 you you hear this thing in college you
13:08 can use calculators in college because
13:12 the college is like look we don't have a
13:14 million years for you to do long-form
13:16 division and so just use your calculator
13:20 they never teach you how to do a chi a
13:22 sine cosine equation and to get way up
13:26 inside advanced math and then you don't
13:28 wanna wait for it anyway because it even
13:29 takes a calculator a long time well it
13:32 used to excuse me used to the calculator
13:34 long time you did cosine ago boom and
13:36 they give you the number well in this
13:40 particular episode
13:42 we're doing long division what if you
13:46 are every being in the universe and I
13:49 mean every single being in the universe
13:51 if it can register as a life force you
13:54 will rotate through that being and be
13:56 that being you will know what it's like
13:58 to be a rock a plant an insect
14:02 fish a human being and potentially an
14:05 infinite number of other beings that we
14:08 haven't discovered yet is an extremely
14:12 interesting notion to go through because
14:17 if you process it well the first stage I
14:19 think you'll go through is one of well
14:24 geez I better be nice to every human
14:26 being on planet earth because that being
14:29 is me you'll see an insect and you'll be
14:32 like the I forgot the exact church in
14:36 India that does it but there's the ones
14:39 where they sweep in front of their feet
14:41 because they're not supposed to step on
14:42 a bug when on a microscopic level the
14:47 sweeping itself is probably tearing that
14:49 tearing the bodies apart of all kinds of
14:51 microscopic things but the intention is
14:53 there right okay after a while a brewing
14:59 on this concept if you're like me you
15:02 will then read the news look out the
15:05 world and you'll see people who are off
15:07 course and it's a really weird thing
15:11 because people are off course and all
15:13 kinds of different levels you might have
15:15 someone who's homeless who simply needs
15:16 some help and they're willing to work to
15:19 get the help some people have been
15:21 homeless for so long they're talking to
15:22 themselves you know holding two
15:24 different conversations with multiple
15:26 personalities they don't have the the
15:30 faculties and the wherewithal to get
15:33 back on their feet because they're
15:35 malnutritioned mentally ill but it's
15:39 probably a temporary situation that can
15:43 be resolved as long as they were to get
15:44 nutrition get a safe place to stay
15:48 but they're going to be tired and you're
15:50 gonna have to work with their body to
15:52 give them energy and depending on how
15:53 old they are
15:55 man when you fall down at five years old
15:59 getting back up is nothing you don't
16:01 weigh much you have low center of
16:02 gravity and a ton of energy if you fall
16:06 down at 70 and you don't break your hip
16:09 it's hard to get up you're tired your
16:14 maximum apex of energy is not going to
16:16 be what it was in previous years and so
16:21 we look at people who have fallen and we
16:23 have to relatively patch in what they
16:27 are if it regardless if we believe that
16:30 they are us but you do have radicals
16:34 that are out of control
16:36 they are very self too brainwashed they
16:41 have come up with doctrines that don't
16:43 make any sense they've got all their
16:46 addiction dopamine patterns in their
16:48 brain attached to things that are
16:50 horrific we know a lot of them right
16:53 spirit cookers and Satanists and
16:58 politicians and corporate you know CEOs
17:02 and all that kind of stuff all kinds of
17:04 bad people out there we're gonna do for
17:07 them and then you have the notion of
17:10 well if you're gonna devote any time in
17:13 your life to help another human being
17:14 then you're going to be losing
17:15 opportunities that would be afforded to
17:17 you if you didn't have to do that and
17:20 some people are like that some people
17:22 are so emphatic they just they can't go
17:25 to sleep if someone's suffering that
17:27 they could help in their mind what I
17:30 find is that we kind of go through
17:32 stages in helping other people because
17:36 we do it and we get some satisfaction
17:37 that we gave away some of our own
17:40 benefits in life that we work really
17:42 hard for that we inherited or what have
17:43 you and then you know you can't do it
17:47 all day long you've got to go back to
17:49 your own life regardless if you're
17:50 completely wealthy and you don't need to
17:51 work anymore
17:52 you just can't save the world you know
17:57 this whole West world thing has also
17:59 added a huge piece of the equation
18:00 because now I'm watching script writing
18:02 in a completely different manner
18:05 I just watched John Carter again
18:08 I hadn't seen it since I first came out
18:11 apparently that movie costs five hundred
18:13 million dollars to make regardless of
18:15 what you hear and it was a big box
18:18 office bomb but it's a pretty damn good
18:20 movie and you you find out that the main
18:27 character lost his wife very gladiator
18:31 like there's a bunch of movies like this
18:33 but he wasn't where he was supposed to
18:35 be in enough time to save his wife and
18:38 she was murdered while he was gone it's
18:41 not a big part of the movie but they
18:42 kind of they almost deus ex machina push
18:45 it into the end of the script to give
18:47 him a reason to fight this battle
18:49 because he has another opportunity to
18:51 save another woman that he's in love
18:52 with and so he flashes back to the death
18:55 of his wife and he slaughters all these
18:57 dudes it's Disney so it's not too
19:00 hardcore but what was the the
19:03 cornerstone or keystone of the hosts in
19:07 West world he gave them Ford and Arnold
19:13 gave him a tragedy in their life a
19:16 fictional tragedy that didn't happen
19:18 gave them a Keystone and they worked off
19:21 that to sort of why they do what they do
19:23 you know Batman is the best example in
19:25 the in the DC Universe his parents were
19:29 murdered in an alleyway I told a story a
19:32 really long time ago that when I got
19:35 into role playing especially in the
19:37 champions role-playing system I had some
19:40 buddies I was playing with I was being
19:42 the GM for the first time so I was
19:43 running all the story and as a
19:45 futuristic world and I ended up one
19:50 night I solved one of the myths to solve
19:55 one of the Keystone's for one of the
19:57 guys I erased it and he quit
20:00 automatically he's kind of being a dick
20:03 but it was probably time for us to
20:05 switch games or whatever but instead of
20:07 saying that he was like well I'm done
20:09 I'm like what do you say it will you his
20:12 girlfriend died or something in the past
20:14 that I resurrected her in a particular
20:16 way so we're kind of a matrix e ways the
20:18 way I did it but he says well I got my
20:21 girlfriend back so I don't care I'm not
20:22 going to be a suit
20:22 here anymore I'm gonna go off and get
20:24 married and do all this other stuff and
20:25 I went really you lost all your morals
20:27 you lost the idea that there is
20:29 suffering in the world and you've got
20:31 super powers to handle it and so anyway
20:33 but he made a good point
20:35 he was he was teaching me a lesson for
20:38 storytelling
20:38 you never ever solved the problem of
20:41 Batman's parents dying you never bring
20:42 him back they don't get resurrected less
20:45 he ceases to become Batman potentially
20:49 but a one soul the infinite one infinity
20:55 is this paradox that feels to me as if
20:59 it is something that is too well let me
21:02 give you an analogy how my brain thinks
21:04 about infinity if I try to conceive of
21:08 the infinite number set infinitely
21:10 divisible infinitely exponential so then
21:14 go up or it can go down you can get this
21:16 the infinite small thing even a big
21:19 thing what my brain does is sort of a
21:22 rubber band effect I go out and conceive
21:25 of these numbers as far as I can go in a
21:27 split second and then my brain comes
21:28 back fast because it's like man I can't
21:30 do this I have no technical mechanism to
21:35 conceive event okay same thing goes for
21:39 all things that are attached to infinity
21:41 how many souls do we have how many
21:44 people have lived on earth I mean that's
21:46 not an infinite thing but geez the
21:47 number is really hot isn't it
21:49 I'll think about that you if you have a
21:54 similar experience let's just put that
21:56 way and I don't know that you do I don't
21:58 know they need human being can conceive
22:00 of infinity so I don't know what you
22:01 guys do when you bottom out with that
22:03 conception but if you're like me and you
22:06 have this rubber band effect your brain
22:08 starts to basically reject the algorithm
22:10 it's sort of like all those sci-fi
22:12 movies where a robot gets a circular
22:14 logic loop and starts to self-destruct
22:18 we have the ability to abort the thought
22:22 we reprogram ourselves very quickly to
22:25 get out of that whole thing now if we
22:31 believe that the universe is hinted with
22:34 the evidence of how it works
22:36 and you know what's funny about what I'm
22:39 saying here is that you have Bibles that
22:41 are full of all kinds of symbolism
22:43 you have architecture with all kinds of
22:45 symbolism we worry about all the same
22:48 mental symbolism and all that stuff but
22:51 the more genius that an individual gets
22:53 or a group of individuals they signal
22:57 the predictive program they're trying to
23:02 sort of look at each other and go well
23:06 we're smarter than all these people that
23:08 don't know what we're doing and so based
23:11 on that we're gonna we're going to need
23:14 to communicate with each other because
23:16 otherwise we're bored to death so
23:18 they're gonna do all this symbolism it's
23:22 a huge wink-wink nudge-nudge to each
23:24 other all the Super Bowl half times
23:26 where they have these crazy Masonic
23:29 rituals it doesn't always happen you
23:31 know Prince did it he was okay rolling
23:34 stones did it I think they came away
23:35 clean but any time they have these teeny
23:38 bopper pop stars then we have symbolism
23:42 like crazy
23:43 someone is winking to someone because
23:47 these pop stars don't have the IQ to
23:49 come up with all this stuff they don't
23:51 someone is orchestrating this for them
23:53 get out there and put the suit on with
23:56 the devil outfit on put this lion thing
23:58 on whatever it is the reason why I
24:03 mentioned that is that what if the
24:04 universe is hinted with all of its
24:06 answers and humanity through an open
24:11 mind mechanism instead of an
24:12 indoctrinated mechanism is capable of
24:19 opening the mind letting in these
24:22 infinite concepts but instead of
24:25 processing them as infinity we process
24:28 the process them as a singularity as a
24:31 one how do you handle like number sets
24:35 well we simply say that in order to
24:42 distinguish infinity everyone can get
24:44 their own number what number was that
24:48 being
24:49 as it's like the that's like the tape
24:52 and Beetlejuice at the very end you know
24:53 when he's sitting in the waiting room
24:54 waiting for his his meeting and he
24:57 steals the really low number from the
25:00 headshrinker and the headshrinker does
25:02 dust on his head and he shrinks down
25:06 everyone gets a number but maybe numbers
25:09 are simply meant to be conceived of as
25:11 numbers it's a set it's an object if I
25:16 bought you a bunch of Legos that had all
25:18 the distinctive pieces that I was a
25:21 Copenhagen is where that company is all
25:24 the pieces that they've ever conceived
25:25 over in this box and there's a limited
25:27 amount of course but in there are your
25:31 pieces you need some more I'll get you
25:33 some more whatever you're trying to
25:35 build
25:35 we'll just keep go we'll keep going back
25:38 to the store and getting you more until
25:39 you're done so much of the universe is
25:42 infinite they say there's infinite
25:45 colors man we'll never conceive of that
25:50 and it doesn't actually go up that high
25:53 there's a bunch of arguments as to
25:55 whether man can really distinguish
25:57 beyond a certain threshold are we at a
26:00 few tens of millions of colors or can we
26:03 really conceive of a few billion colors
26:05 I do not have that answer but you have
26:09 this answer from God you have this truth
26:12 from God you are one you are the
26:17 infinite one and what if the last thing
26:19 he said was you are me and I am you see
26:24 when you get back to the dugout after
26:27 this play how does that change you you
26:32 know if you just use it in the sense of
26:35 you have your self your self awareness
26:39 this equation would first be applied
26:42 hopefully to you how do you look at
26:44 yourself in the mirror well we're
26:48 talking about a plural an infinite
26:51 plural okay so not sure there's a heck
26:55 of a lot we can accomplish with
26:57 conceiving of this except to say this
27:00 if you believe that you have to go and
27:04 do something go get your boon of
27:06 knowledge to know something a journey
27:09 you have to leave your house you have to
27:11 go another place in the in the world or
27:13 in the universe eventually to get the
27:15 information you're looking for
27:16 that's an interesting way to live your
27:18 life right it's it's the Indiana Jones
27:21 way to live your life nothing wrong with
27:23 that but now what if like I said a long
27:28 time ago
27:29 I've been repeating it a lot for you
27:31 guys you actually because you've been
27:36 everything you know everything your only
27:41 problem is is you don't think you know
27:43 everything
27:44 believe me we know people think they
27:46 know everything but I think you feel me
27:49 what I'm saying and I was giving an
27:50 example to a friend of mine and I said
27:52 you know take that big rig right there I
27:56 said what if you wanted to learn how to
27:58 drive a big rig and so in your mind
28:00 you've got to go off to school to drive
28:02 the big rig now I'm not gonna say you
28:04 use this analogy personally but if you
28:08 have been every single truck driver
28:09 every single mechanical engineer you are
28:15 those people that invented that entire
28:17 thing you actually know where every bolt
28:21 is on that particular model I'll be
28:25 repeating and repeating this analogy to
28:27 you guys and this is sort of a bedrock
28:31 platform / paradigm to really make this
28:34 make sense in my mind which is the
28:36 following you have to build a query to
28:39 the universe to get the answer back you
28:43 know I cut a lot of pauses in the show
28:46 and usually the pauses aren't I'm
28:48 letting a lot more of them fly through
28:50 so there's a little bit of sensibility
28:52 of how my mind thinks and how fast it
28:53 thinks and that sort of thing but
28:55 sometimes I will be going after because
28:57 I'm you know in my brain I'm projecting
29:00 five or ten minutes out but I'm gonna
29:02 talk about and I'll see something but
29:05 I'll mention that right but it's coming
29:06 at me slowly because I'm eating up all
29:09 the topics I want to cover before I get
29:11 to the one it's
29:12 that's gonna be the next consecutive
29:13 thing I'm gonna say and I'll have a
29:17 person's name on the tip of my tongue I
29:19 mean it's right there I've got the name
29:20 I know what movie they were in or
29:22 whatever example I'm trying to give but
29:24 by the time it gets to me I know exactly
29:27 what I want to say that person wears the
29:31 name where's the name of the movie
29:32 where's the name of the actor I'm
29:34 missing one piece of information and one
29:36 of the pauses that I do as I'll stop and
29:39 I'll go how is that person's name from
29:42 the movie that girl and I start building
29:44 a query out loud with my voice just
29:47 whispering it just like that and I'll
29:49 sit and listen
29:50 just like Indiana Jones dad said in
29:52 Indiana Jones 3 Sean Connery so I put
29:56 the query out and I listen and every
30:00 single time it comes to me I mean
30:02 sometimes I get impatient I grab my
30:05 phone and I look it up
30:06 very rarely I don't have to do that I
30:08 just choose to do that and I think you
30:11 have the same capability you're asking
30:13 the universe for that answer back now
30:17 won't lie I also believe that there are
30:19 individuals that are in spirit form that
30:23 are right there and there maybe reading
30:24 a book or newspaper or whatever they're
30:26 doing carving something and they're just
30:27 like oh it's so and so oh yeah yeah
30:30 thanks
30:31 boom start talking but my mind is
30:34 extremely open to that process I believe
30:37 that that process works I use it all the
30:39 time so whether it is a biological trick
30:43 from my brain in a Kurtz well model or
30:45 if I am truly doing what I think what
30:49 I'm doing which is going out my Piney on
30:50 gland out to the universe and simply
30:53 waiting for the sequel statement to come
30:55 back it works and you know I I had that
31:03 epiphany and just started trying to do
31:06 it I don't even know where it started I
31:08 think it started during this show to be
31:10 honest with you if I'd done it before it
31:13 was just a CERN dipa distinct again you
31:16 know if we do that together when we're
31:17 together right now what the hell's that
31:19 guy's name oh yeah and some people you
31:21 have those friends that know everyone's
31:22 name so they just go BAM
31:24 you know it's like they memorize
31:26 everything they've ever heard but now I
31:30 do this show I do tons of episodes most
31:35 the comments are extremely friendly but
31:38 you know once I get an episode where
31:40 someone is incapable of processing the
31:42 data that are incapable of even watching
31:45 the episode all the way through and
31:47 they're sort of you know shouting inside
31:49 their comments or telling me that I'm
31:51 wrong or what have you and they run off
31:53 I want you guys to know while I'm on the
31:56 subject of that before I finish up this
31:58 point I do get a fairly routine
32:05 heartbeat of listeners saying you guys
32:09 are watching who come to be on the
32:11 outside and your your your concerned
32:18 that I don't believe in Christianity as
32:21 a factual story and you know you know
32:27 that I believe in the message and I
32:29 believe it's divine in other Luke 14:26
32:31 that's a little doozy go look that one
32:36 up but you come to me and you're you're
32:41 being so kind and so polite and you're
32:43 saying well I know that you don't
32:45 believe this is true but now you have
32:48 lived your whole life and doctrine aided
32:49 in that from birth and so you have a
32:51 very tough a tough step ahead of you if
32:55 you're gonna change your belief systems
32:56 because like I said many of my episodes
32:58 I think it's why we believe which is
33:00 like episode four I think an episode I'm
33:03 extremely proud of go see it on the new
33:05 season 1 channel link in the description
33:11 but when you're indoctrinated for life
33:13 it's really tough but you have found
33:16 beauty and you have found serenity and
33:18 you have found solutions in that text
33:20 you need to know that I know that text
33:21 as well so I find the same divine
33:24 writing to help me through my life and
33:29 believe me I'm pretty hurted aren't
33:32 familiar with Matthew Matthew Mark Luke
33:33 John and all of the various you know
33:37 factions at the
33:38 books were written for and how Christ
33:39 was giving an example of after example
33:42 of how he spent his time who he helped
33:46 who he said to help how he said to
33:49 behave but if I get to go back to my
33:52 point originally I just want to know
33:54 you're out there and you're not the only
33:56 one that does that and I respect you
33:58 greatly and let's just celebrate in the
34:01 the truth that's in that book which is
34:05 mostly metaphorical and in the realm of
34:09 God which is love right to help another
34:13 is to love another and that's where we
34:15 are but I'll get someone who's telling
34:19 me that I'm wrong sometimes they're very
34:21 friendly about it sometimes they're not
34:22 friendly about it well now if I truly
34:26 truly want to adopt this belief system
34:27 and live by it which I have not done yet
34:30 I'm still contemplating it I'm still
34:32 examining it so I want to make this
34:34 episode early on so that you can hear my
34:37 mind in its infantile stage of this
34:40 thought process I have to stop and go
34:45 wow that's me on the other side I've had
34:48 a different life I grew up I'm a
34:50 different age different location
34:52 different relatives different religious
34:53 doctrine or anti doctrine and that's me
34:56 on the other side and I'm heartbroken
34:59 that some guy is telling me that we
35:01 didn't land on the moon and I really
35:02 want to believe that we landed on the
35:03 moon it's special to me hmm
35:06 and that's why as I get older I tend not
35:10 to try and convert people but now let's
35:14 just say let's just do an example of
35:16 where we might trigger to negate this
35:21 entire paradigm and go back into the
35:23 human paradigm of all these restrictions
35:25 and closed-mindedness which I fall
35:29 victim to all the time and someone just
35:31 says the right sword a combination of fu
35:34 in a in a post and then I kind of come
35:37 back a little sarcastic towards them I
35:39 try not to ever do that and I catch
35:44 myself
35:46 let's just say there's something in the
35:48 world where something occurred and
35:51 physics completely negates it can't
35:57 happen that way
35:59 you dropped a shotput
36:01 and it stayed in midair it's like the
36:04 the new traumatic cup in the second book
36:07 of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy
36:09 the big statue of Arthur throwing a new
36:12 traumatic cup and the cup is just
36:14 floating in mid-air this gigantic
36:15 Styrofoam cup you can assume in your
36:17 mind right and they asked in the book
36:19 well how does it stay there and the
36:21 birds which are the new race on that
36:25 planet because they got tired of living
36:27 on the ground so these spawn wings and
36:28 became bird-like they said it's it's
36:31 there because it is artistically correct
36:34 it is art and it floats there because
36:38 it's supposed to and this would be the
36:41 equivalent of like taking the you know
36:45 Athens like one of those orbiting the
36:48 pyramids and they're just floating in
36:49 mid-air and there's like well it keeps
36:50 the pyramids floating him in here
36:51 because it's artistically correct okay I
36:54 mean that's why I love Douglas Adams he
36:56 gets you to think differently about
36:58 everything I'm not sure that Douglas
37:02 Adams has ever finished a page of text
37:05 without throwing one of these at you
37:08 which is why I think the Hitchhiker's
37:10 Guide to the galaxy the original BBC
37:13 broadcast is that one of the finest
37:16 pieces of critical thinking fiction
37:19 that's ever been written and if you
37:21 think about how brilliant this guy was
37:23 in 1978 and how awake he was in 78 it
37:25 boggles the mind he didn't have the
37:27 Internet he had College and some people
37:33 around him but he's writing this
37:34 extremely young as well some people are
37:38 like that in my past you know I was
37:41 creative in a very traditional way I
37:43 don't know if I was creative and I'm
37:45 like storytelling I'm pretty creative
37:47 and I can do some twists and turns today
37:50 I'm pretty lethal at it but when I was a
37:52 kid his age early 20s mid 20s clever
37:57 right I wrote some really tight code
37:58 drew some really good
37:59 work it's a pretty clever music blah
38:02 blah blah but it wasn't off the chart or
38:05 anything if we're to contemplate these
38:08 heavier subjects this is sort of what we
38:10 have to do unplug everything how many
38:15 times have you here's an analogy for
38:17 your mind you've got an entertainment
38:19 center in your house someplace where you
38:21 keep all your electronics you got your
38:23 computer desk you got a printer and a
38:26 scanning thing and you're you know all
38:28 this legacy crap you've got a million
38:30 cores because you've had four phones
38:31 over ten years and you have a charger
38:34 still plugged into a bunch of outlets
38:35 but you don't even using them anymore
38:37 what do you do to clean that up
38:40 you save all your work on your computer
38:43 and you shut it down you unplug
38:45 everything you may even take everything
38:48 out of the room you have vacuum for the
38:50 first time in 20 years you dust and then
38:53 you slowly bring everything back into
38:56 the room maybe a range rearrange your
38:57 desk like I said previous episode here
38:59 you do it simply because it gives you a
39:01 signal of refreshment the Hawthorne
39:04 effect feels good yeah just mix it up a
39:07 little bit part of me by the way
39:10 believes that we create these residual
39:12 patterns of vibration so let's say you
39:16 put a desk in a particular area in your
39:18 house and you put your chair there it
39:19 could be for your sofa it could be for
39:21 your bed as well and you're always
39:24 sitting in that location in your room
39:27 and you're vibrating a particular weight
39:28 you've had a stressful previous year you
39:31 have maybe some arguments with your
39:33 loved ones you've just stressed a little
39:35 bit but now you're okay you're all right
39:38 well it is a good idea to move things
39:45 around because you're going to get out
39:47 of that vibrational pockets it's just
39:49 like the movie The Shining or the book
39:51 The Shining where he said you know it's
39:53 just like when someone burns toast you
39:57 can smell it after it happened but
39:59 there's no toast
40:00 there's no burnt toast in the kitchen
40:01 but you can still smell it and that's
40:04 sort of how the frequencies work there
40:05 so definitely use that to free up your
40:08 world a little bit rotate literally
40:11 rotate objects in your house
40:13 you're Finn chewy right and I know I'm
40:18 saying that funny okay you know when we
40:21 stare at the bodies in space like the
40:23 moon the moon was out the other day and
40:25 boy that thing looked like it was just
40:27 hovering a few thousand feet over this
40:31 over the ground it was so clear the
40:34 waned side of the moon that was in the
40:37 shadow was so beautifully backlit from
40:40 the Sun it was phenomenal and I pointed
40:43 it and I was going out to dinner the
40:44 friend of mine I pointed up I said
40:46 that's why people think that thing's
40:48 only 3200 miles up in the sky because
40:50 look how utterly clear it is with the
40:52 naked eye but they want you to believe
40:55 it's two hundred and thirty seven
40:56 thousand miles away on average look at
41:00 it this thing going man it looks really
41:02 close if it was a seeing eye chart you'd
41:05 get all the letters right on it you know
41:07 I want to make sure that we are parsing
41:11 this world from as many perspectives as
41:14 possible so that we can find the ones
41:16 that are true we dream right we dream
41:21 and we dream and different worlds
41:24 sometimes don't we buildings and cities
41:27 and places we've never been before
41:30 but we have the ability to project that
41:33 world in its infinite complexity within
41:36 our mind like I said we it took us from
41:40 the mid 70s to probably I don't know
41:46 maybe Tron 1982 we get your first sort
41:49 of kind of photo real looking objects
41:52 and then you get into the was the last
41:54 starfighter it was all CG it look really
41:57 much better and then you got into abyss
42:00 I forgot abyss was done in 89 just prior
42:04 to Terminator 2 it had this CG water but
42:09 really was Terminator 2 that borrowed
42:11 from the abyss cuz it's all Cameron
42:13 where you really had super photo real
42:16 stuff and then you had Jurassic Park
42:17 where you had organic dinosaurs looking
42:22 as real as real
42:24 unbelievable techniques they'd figured
42:26 out to make this film and when I think
42:28 of Jurassic Park I think about the
42:29 velociraptors in the kitchen that's
42:32 where I went to a presentation in San
42:36 Francisco narrated by Steve I think it's
42:38 named Steve Williams he's one of the
42:41 guys that worked on that film at ILM and
42:44 you start to see how reality was just
42:46 going to be usurped but our brain has an
42:50 ILM in it our brain has an island that's
42:53 probably a hundred years in the future
42:55 in terms of utter perfection we see
42:59 things and they have all the right
43:00 shadows all the right colors everything
43:03 and you will have some nebulous more
43:05 abstract dreams from time to time but
43:07 the ones that are good or ones that feel
43:09 like this world a little bit so we have
43:14 these moments of proof that we are way
43:18 bigger than this bag of chemicals again
43:23 they can damage the body and mess with
43:27 your memories and give you some memories
43:28 back you know you can they can push on
43:30 your brain when your skulls open and
43:32 you'll remember being 5 years old like
43:34 it was yesterday sort of thing but they
43:36 can't tell you where your memories are
43:38 in your brain oh there's books that say
43:41 they think it weird where it's at but
43:43 they're talking about an infinitely
43:45 small clump of cells that there's not
43:48 enough cells or binary packets of energy
43:52 in that little clump in your brain to
43:54 account for everything you can remember
43:56 especially not this little island
43:58 factory that makes dreams they're just
44:01 just you know for you about a week ago I
44:04 released the previous life's episode and
44:07 that's what it dovetails into this
44:10 infinite one but even that has sort of a
44:15 linear principle to it you can't be
44:19 anything that's alive today because
44:20 you're alive today your soul is this
44:22 singularity thing that can only move
44:24 forward in time if time exists which
44:27 would have to exist to have this linear
44:29 principle imposed on us but this
44:31 infinite one theory is that the time
44:33 doesn't really exist
44:35 that's why I can be you and you can be
44:38 me if you subscribe to this channel then
44:42 there's some connection that we have I
44:44 talk the way you think perhaps I'm your
44:48 your older uncle or I'm your clever
44:51 nephew so I might say some things you
44:55 didn't think about but in the end we're
44:56 sort of vibrating in the same frequency
44:58 and there's other people that will come
45:00 and they see it in black and white and
45:02 man they're gone
45:03 they they have had it recommended to
45:06 them and so they watch it for a little
45:08 while they see me with long hair or
45:09 whatever and they don't like the way I
45:11 talk you know I get these comments every
45:13 once long very sparse but they happen
45:15 and for me it just makes me laugh it
45:17 makes me just people just like I just
45:21 sling some judge the book by its cover
45:23 statement you know and and I'm pretty
45:26 impervious to that stuff because I never
45:28 let it bother me in my lifetime I just
45:32 you know my whole thought is as long as
45:33 I'm not getting lynched because we've
45:35 lost all of our freedoms hey say what
45:37 you want just you know go back to your
45:40 world go about mine I'm not imposing
45:42 myself on you for sure I would never do
45:44 that if I thought it'd give you one of
45:47 these examples kind of dovetails and a
45:51 loose way to this theory but if imagine
45:54 that we had some sort of what is it the
45:56 second episode season one a black mirror
45:59 where that guy was stuck in a world
46:02 where he's pedaling abide kiss whole
46:03 life and you pedal for credits and then
46:05 you spend the credits to have a moment
46:07 of peace in your room to go and become
46:09 something else in life you buy a ticket
46:11 to a talent show or whatever it is
46:13 imagine if deep thoughts was suddenly
46:18 forced into every household in every
46:21 household had to watch deep thoughts
46:24 it's a ludicrous example but the idea is
46:26 if I was ever notified okay kid you know
46:29 your shows gonna be everywhere and
46:31 people are gonna have to watch your show
46:33 keep up the good work
46:35 oh my lord the pressure of that would
46:38 just be
46:40 too much this I would change I would I
46:44 would not be myself because I would feel
46:47 the empathetic pain that everyone would
46:49 feel having to watch this kind of
46:51 content that's why I like the fact that
46:53 it's an electorial thing you don't like
46:56 the show you don't subscribe you never
46:57 watch it again you dig it you subscribe
46:59 you come back now you gotta come back as
47:00 though and subscribe you by the way I
47:03 should probably stop just for one second
47:05 oh this is a horrible place to say this
47:06 but you guys are our being unsubscribed
47:09 from the show there's a rumor that
47:13 YouTube's gonna get rid of the Bell so
47:17 you won't get notifications which i
47:18 think is ludicrous because the operating
47:20 systems have od'd all notifications man
47:23 you can't visit a website today where
47:25 goes you mind if what you've seen your
47:26 computer a bunch of spam and you're just
47:28 like block block block where every place
47:30 I go I got a block everything so just
47:33 know if you're passionate about the show
47:35 you're gonna have to visit the channel
47:37 in a bin a bookmark fashion because you
47:40 will be unsubscribed at some point I
47:42 want you guys to start thinking about
47:45 this what it would mean if we were one
47:49 think about it in the fashion that
47:51 someone would tell you as a child that
47:53 this is simply the way it is that we
47:54 know this is an empirical fact and then
47:57 try to regress yourself back to the
47:59 infantile mind that we have what we were
48:01 young for anything's possible because no
48:04 one's told you it's impossible yet how
48:07 would that change everything now
48:11 obviously we live in a world where that
48:13 is not what people believe and therefore
48:15 we have Wars and therefore we have
48:17 hatred we have you know insane areas of
48:21 the planet where women are castrated and
48:23 killed and you know murder is just not
48:25 even a big deal you know some cultures
48:29 are just built to be rude it's just the
48:33 way they're built there is a a weird
48:39 thing that that sort of is the anti
48:42 belief system in the infinite one which
48:45 is the following in my opinion we have
48:48 the US and them mentality we have the
48:52 haves and have-nots mint
48:54 and it's very difficult I absolutely
48:56 find it impossible not to fall into
48:59 those two categories in conversation
49:01 once certain subjects come up you do
49:04 have this need for self-preservation
49:07 but I thought of it several times of
49:09 like we have immigration in this planet
49:12 that's out of control we have countries
49:14 that are trying to take over the entire
49:15 world with their population and it's
49:18 sort of this bull the Frog strategy that
49:22 because the rest of the world is pretty
49:25 nice we're allowing these people to move
49:27 in and buy up all the property and then
49:29 multiply like bunnies and eventually a
49:33 bunch of races we'll see will cease to
49:35 exist until it's down to one and they're
49:39 very you know some of these races are
49:40 very anti mixing they don't date anyone
49:44 outside their race but then they'll the
49:46 second that you deny them anything which
49:49 we don't but I mean if we if we were to
49:51 deny them because of their race this
49:53 unequal distribution of resources and
49:56 this hey you're taking up too much space
49:57 on the world
49:58 you're only one race and we got a bunch
50:00 of other races and we all deserve to
50:02 have you know some equal space and I
50:04 know there's been violations all over
50:06 the place Native Americans in America
50:07 you know you have your your genocides in
50:12 Africa you have your Armenians you know
50:15 thing your Jewish Holocaust and all
50:16 these different things so we've done
50:17 these horrible things but once we
50:19 hopefully reach a point where we wake up
50:21 you know there's gonna have to be some
50:23 sort of conversation about that right
50:24 we're not having it now so it's sort of
50:27 organically occurring Europe knows all
50:30 about it trust me but if you think about
50:33 the the way that the ruling class and
50:36 the royalty of the world think it's the
50:38 US and them where are the smart people
50:42 were the ones that control the world
50:43 were built of genetics that are just the
50:47 second our babies are born they're
50:48 smarter than everyone else's babies it's
50:51 not true I just recently heard a a
50:55 pretty horrific story about one of the
50:58 sons of one of the most wealthy families
51:03 in the world just becoming a complete
51:05 drug addict and just
51:08 you wouldn't you wouldn't think that
51:10 that would happen but when you hear the
51:11 story like well I guess that's the case
51:13 but I thought they had controllers that
51:15 made that made sure that their offspring
51:17 didn't do these things but it's not the
51:18 truth at all
51:19 this kid had infinite money that tons of
51:22 drugs and was spreading it all over his
51:24 friends and whatever friends and quotes
51:27 people were there to get their drugs
51:30 from him for free but they incubate this
51:33 and they build policies based on us and
51:35 them my hint I just said it in a
51:38 previous episode tony rockefeller
51:40 talking to Aaron Rizzo saying you know
51:42 what do you little baby opossum just ran
51:45 by you know what do you care about them
51:49 save your own family screw them if
51:52 they're too stupid to save themselves
51:55 then screw them and that's what's kind
51:57 of going on right now we're being so
51:59 nice and we're so we're so docile to all
52:03 the control mechanisms around us and
52:05 especially in America where we are
52:07 nothing more than the entertained for a
52:09 huge nation of the entertained and so
52:12 we're looking the other way constantly
52:13 while people come and take the country
52:15 away trying to destroy our laws trying
52:18 to straw our world hmm I've had this
52:21 thought it's probably cuz I write
52:22 scripts and maybe it's something I'll
52:25 eventually put into a script but let's
52:27 see it got all the way down to two races
52:29 on earth and one you know they're gonna
52:32 battle it out they they just know they
52:35 have to that's like a dominant species
52:38 thing and the race that's potentially
52:43 the smaller one is the more intelligent
52:44 one they have the more creative force in
52:48 them they're the engineers that have
52:49 invented most of the things around the
52:51 world and the one that has simply
52:52 multiplied the most that's all they've
52:55 done and they all they do is copy
52:57 everyone else's stuff so they don't have
52:59 any inventors yet because there's no
53:02 mother of invention to invent and it
53:06 gets down to the last guy in that
53:08 smaller race and in the end that guy can
53:12 he's gonna be mortally wounded maybe
53:15 he's shot maybe he stabbed whatever it
53:18 is maybe he's poisoned but he's got a
53:20 few seconds left a conscious thought
53:22 before he has the dial out but he let's
53:25 just say he's a very he or she is a very
53:28 wise person and looks up at the person
53:30 who's standing over them as they die and
53:34 their last thought as well at least
53:37 you're a human go ahead take over the
53:41 world obviously we were too nice to two
53:47 wife you guys out to face the planet
53:49 before I got this bad or build a better
53:50 world so we lost but at least humanity's
53:55 gonna live and you know even last words
53:57 are like they'll explore the Stars you
53:59 know go figure out what this place is
54:01 because now you're gonna start warm with
54:03 each other and it'll be people with good
54:06 teeth versus people with good eyes
54:08 versus people have better hair people
54:11 who are taller people who are thinner
54:13 versus people who are fatter they're
54:15 gonna start warring among themselves
54:16 because they have that primitive
54:17 mentality of needing to war in the first
54:20 place I firmly believed if we could get
54:23 behind this one theory this infinite one
54:27 theory that we are all one then it would
54:33 simply be that you would improve
54:34 yourself and the world that you live in
54:36 because you're improving everyone at
54:39 that point and most fantastic humans
54:43 that have ever lived have had that
54:45 mentality they tried to better the world
54:48 and they did now obviously it's a it's a
54:52 fight against time it takes a lot to
54:57 configure your life to be able to help
54:59 other people at least in a macro sense
55:02 you can help everyone in your
55:04 neighborhood or in your town but if
55:06 you're gonna make a technology that it
55:09 gets rid of world hunger its rid of
55:11 disease people that suffer from things
55:16 like insomnia what-have-you and you've
55:18 got this solution and you pass it out to
55:20 the world and it makes the world a
55:21 better place it's very tough to
55:23 configure your life to be at the right
55:25 place at the right time with the right
55:26 invention to get investors or sell
55:29 enough that you can reinvest in yourself
55:31 and expand your business to make this
55:33 town its kind of thing happen to write
55:34 the best poem
55:35 it touches everyone's heart no matter if
55:37 it's translated into 100 different
55:40 languages it works in every language
55:42 it's very tough to do that but now think
55:45 about this I once wanted to create a
55:49 video game and I we almost did it we
55:51 bought all the domains to do it but I
55:54 wanted to make a game where the entire
55:55 world worked to build something in in in
56:00 a basically an MMO so imagine you have a
56:04 what I was going to do is build a like a
56:10 pyramid let's just say a pyramid or a
56:12 city but a pyramid is cool because the
56:15 pyramid what we do is we say look this
56:18 pyramid is going to need 1 billion
56:20 people to participate one time to build
56:25 this pyramid it was bricks in there now
56:28 someone could sit up all night and put
56:30 in thousands and thousands of bricks and
56:34 eventually gets done and the pyramid if
56:37 you were to say let's divide up the
56:39 world a little bit every single country
56:41 has its flag on the brick and so a
56:44 country with a billion people comes in
56:46 participates like crazy into this thing
56:48 in that pyramid has tons of that country
56:51 on there but in the end we would have
56:54 built a game but the whole world
56:56 participated maybe a country that is
56:59 underestimated puts a tremendous effort
57:02 into this thing and they get on the map
57:03 of the world radar for the very first
57:06 time some tiny country in the world pick
57:10 a country some of these unknown
57:11 countries in Africa that I don't even
57:13 know exists some country in sort of the
57:16 Eurasian States the use Abeka stands and
57:20 Kazakhstan's you know places you don't
57:22 use an average conversation in the first
57:24 world countries that you're talking
57:25 about oil or you're watching a sasha
57:29 Cohen
57:30 bear and sasha was a Sacha Baron Cohen
57:33 don't his movies but just creating
57:37 something where we all get to work
57:38 together and see ourselves as one it
57:42 still promotes individuality of each
57:45 nation state in fact it gives you an
57:47 opportunity to be prideful about
57:49 participation now it would be also
57:52 amazing if in order to get a brick you
57:56 had to do something that forced thought
57:58 perhaps critical thought wouldn't that
58:00 be amazing maybe certain bricks are much
58:04 easier to get the foundational bricks
58:06 are easy to get but the para Meridian
58:08 stone on the top it's made of gold or
58:11 diamonds or whatever it's made out of
58:13 two encrust it with diamonds is
58:16 something extra special you know what
58:19 I'm saying I believe in my heart of
58:23 hearts that that if we were to all
58:26 tomorrow wake up in some amazing
58:31 epiphany and as some amazing
58:32 supernatural thing occurs and we're all
58:34 in the same page and suddenly and this
58:39 is there's a bit of an exception to my
58:41 my analogy here let's just say the non
58:45 elite of the world / ruling class of the
58:47 world have this moment and all of a
58:53 sudden we didn't want to fight any Wars
58:56 anymore the police have perfect
58:59 integrity teachers have perfect
59:02 integrity news agencies have perfect
59:05 integrity etc accessor down the line
59:07 that if there was one person that was
59:10 missed from that equation we would have
59:14 a fatal flaw in the system because that
59:17 one person let's just put it a some
59:21 Rothschild or a sewer or a Windsor a
59:24 person notices that everyone else woke
59:27 up they still had control over some
59:31 money some power they know they can't do
59:34 anything radical because they've lost
59:35 they've lost the race for the time being
59:38 but I think that they would try their
59:41 damndest to indoctrinate everyone away
59:43 from that amazing miracle because the
59:47 one thing that they have builds up in
59:49 their sociopathic paranoia is this
59:52 superiority belief in this control
59:55 mechanism and they believe they have to
59:59 have that
60:01 they would consider the whole world of
60:04 peaceful wonderful people now with this
60:07 miracle to be the enemy and they would
60:11 see themselves just like Iago and a
60:12 fellow even though the most evil
60:14 character in the entire script according
60:16 to Yago he was doing exactly what he
60:19 should have done it's a lot to think
60:21 about isn't it such a simple thought the
60:28 subject of infinity has to be conquered
60:29 I think in my lifetime in terms of the
60:31 way that we conceive of it describe it
60:35 and especially apply it to equations of
60:38 how we behave on a spiritual level and
60:42 in a physical level now let me a throw
60:45 this closing example at you because it's
60:47 been in countless scripts books I should
60:51 say books the predictive programming in
60:55 many works of art 1984 brave new world
61:02 you know rollerball all these movies
61:05 with these kind of bizarre dystopian
61:09 worlds that people live in or fascist
61:11 worlds that people live in they have
61:13 threatened over and over and over
61:15 countless times that they are going to
61:16 eventually once again archive history
61:21 and erase it and then they're going to
61:26 simply say like the obsolete man episode
61:28 in Twilight Zone
61:29 we have deemed what you are saying to be
61:32 obsolete or terrorists information
61:37 against the state hostile beliefs
61:40 against the state and the human spirit
61:44 is built exactly the opposite of that so
61:47 I believe that they will continually
61:50 fail they will continually fight this
61:52 war and if they simply innit to my well
61:57 in my belief system that I don't think
62:00 that they acknowledge that that is the
62:02 the true cornerstone of how the human
62:07 form is built you know it's like Charlie
62:12 Chaplin said in his great
62:14 dictator speech as long as men die
62:19 freedom will prevail or Liberty will
62:22 prevail and he's right the trick of that
62:29 algorithm is to say we have to make sure
62:32 the youth of the world learn these
62:34 theories early at these really
62:37 existential levels don't be bashful
62:40 about teaching a young kid something
62:42 advanced you will find out that they can
62:44 absorb it way faster and way deeper than
62:47 you do as an adult so if you learn
62:49 something at 35 and you share with a
62:52 five-year-old again probably one that
62:56 hasn't raised on a cell phone an iPad or
62:58 a gaming console or TV that kid will
63:01 absorb that in seconds and apply it to
63:05 the rest of their lives and that's why
63:07 the globalists are always attacking our
63:10 kids changing our schools they're trying
63:13 to pass all the stuff in schools right
63:15 now to screw up all the kids super bad
63:17 science super bad medicine all
63:20 pretending to be Robin Hood's at the
63:22 same time if you are involved in
63:25 anything creative in this world my my
63:32 advice is try to touch children with I
63:36 got to be careful where I said because
63:37 Biden's out there try to impact a child
63:40 with your education to open their minds
63:43 and stay free
63:44 and you might even say look these old
63:48 guys in the world they believe this old
63:51 way and this old way is that you're not
63:54 to be free meaning what you want to do
63:56 with your life when I said what do you
63:59 wanna be when you grow up they don't
64:01 want you to be that thing when you grow
64:02 up they want you to be what they want
64:03 you to be when you grow up and it
64:06 probably won't be anything that you'd
64:08 ever want to be involved in you mean
64:09 North Korea you're gonna be an old USSR
64:11 Russia you're gonna be in China of old
64:14 China you know or they just tell you
64:15 what you do and that's it so stay free
64:18 of that spread it to your friends make
64:20 it a trend because as soon as we can
64:23 separate
64:25 these old bastards from us and they get
64:28 to die off you know cutting off their
64:31 adrenal chromes supplies would be a
64:33 great way to keep them refreshing as
64:36 quickly as possible but let them perish
64:39 and we take over the the foundation of
64:42 the pyramid and basically maybe we think
64:45 there's more young people than there is
64:47 older people so it does create a pyramid
64:49 at the top right just food for thought
64:52 be very interested in your thought
64:55 process this is a deep deep episode and
64:58 this is where you know the chronic
65:00 listeners will get in there and really
65:01 put down some good comments so I'm very
65:03 interested to hear your feedback if you
65:06 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
65:07 there's a whole bunch of stuff up there
65:09 again over the summer of 2019 I'm gonna
65:12 redo the website so it's got a lot
65:13 better exposure to information it's on
65:16 the site and maybe I'll get the feeds
65:19 from some of the other social media
65:22 integrated into the site but it has
65:25 audio and video so you wanna switch
65:26 feeds from podcast to youtube be my
65:29 guest
65:29 we have a locked Facebook group some of
65:31 the coolest people on planet Earth
65:33 I keep the Twitter updated now pretty
65:36 much right when these episodes release I
65:37 do apologize to the podcast folks
65:40 there's a separate process I do to
65:41 prepare things for podcast so I'm
65:44 usually releasing two to four at the
65:46 same time hopefully I get my pipeline
65:49 streamlined a little bit more so that's
65:50 a little easier there's two ways to
65:53 donate to the page there's the monthly
65:56 process of patreon and then there's the
65:59 one-time contribution on PayPal I will
66:02 tell you that I am gonna go on break
66:03 once the season is over
66:06 and for those of you been on for two or
66:08 three years you know this is the process
66:10 but when I finish episode 400 I'm gonna
66:14 take a month or two off probably be
66:16 closer to two months and I'm going to
66:18 build up episodes and do a little more
66:20 research on my end and we'll make season
66:24 5 something special but it is really
66:29 really rough for me to think about doing
66:31 another hundred episodes man you know I
66:34 want to go deeper more existential but I
66:37 know
66:38 boring people there's a link to the the
66:41 new season 1 remastered channel so it's
66:45 a different channel on YouTube simply
66:47 because I don't want to be uploading low
66:49 number episodes within the normal
66:51 channel and especially for those you've
66:52 already seen it you're just gonna get
66:53 bored of the notification so I keep that
66:55 off in a separate room it only has 25
66:58 subscribers at this point I don't think
67:01 it'll ever be monetized if it gets
67:03 monetized it'll be because the show
67:05 blows up somehow or it'd be in two years
67:08 when somehow we get four thousand hours
67:11 of viewing in 12 months with a thousand
67:14 subscribers I think that's what it takes
67:15 which is ludicrous they just don't want
67:18 to cut a bunch of tiny checks that's the
67:20 case and I don't blame them but they
67:22 hold it in for $100 threshold before
67:25 they pay out anyway so whatever but for
67:27 those of you who contribute during the
67:30 patreon or using patreon if you guys
67:32 want to pull out during the summertime
67:33 because no contents come and be my guest
67:36 I'll take no offense whatsoever I
67:38 appreciate every single one of you that
67:40 part with $1 to contribute to the show
67:43 it really does help I mean it why buy
67:47 boxes of these cigars I do spend money
67:51 on a lot of the software that I used to
67:52 build the show so it does help so you
67:55 own part of the show in one way or
67:56 another and [ __ ] shoot right now is
68:01 working really well I did notice that I
68:05 have two episodes that I uploaded that
68:06 didn't encode so I'm hoping it's not a
68:09 limit to the size of the video I don't
68:12 think it is but I've got a couple I put
68:15 my moon went up there and it didn't
68:16 process so those are gonna be a little
68:18 out of order simply because that's the
68:20 way that they process things again
68:22 bright seon is supposed to do a 2.0 in
68:24 June which is a month away so hopefully
68:27 they get their upload system working
68:28 because it's not working right now but
68:31 anyway take care of yourself and someone
68:34 else and I will see in the next deep
68:36 thoughts over now
