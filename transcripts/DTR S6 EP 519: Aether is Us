00:14 so

00:27 [Music]
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen
00:39 on this rather chilly evening i'm not
00:42 sure what the temperature is but i'm
00:43 sure it's about
00:44 uh it's a nice 44 degrees out fahrenheit
00:50 be so nice of us 44 celsius
00:54 so today i want to talk about a subject
00:57 that i
00:58 touched on a lot in previous seasons
01:01 but there's kind of a reason to recap
01:04 and
01:05 maybe advance our thinking a little bit
01:06 further in this
01:08 and part of it has to do with um
01:11 one a lot of you are new
01:14 and you probably haven't gone back to
01:16 see the other episodes and so the
01:17 subject matter is completely
01:19 new or you've seen a couple i haven't
01:22 seen them all
01:24 but the other aspect of this is that
01:27 my own brain continues thinking about
01:29 this
01:30 profusely and so i think i have new
01:34 takes on
01:36 this sort of thinking which is
01:39 i'm not sure what i'm going to call this
01:40 i think i might call this uh
01:43 ether is us or we are ether but maybe
01:45 i've already done that title got to make
01:47 sure i haven't done it again
01:49 it's a very fascinating concept so let
01:51 me lay this on you you can decide if you
01:52 want to keep watching
01:54 i think that we are all made out of a
01:56 fundamental particle
01:58 that i'm going to call ether but faraday
02:01 through tesla
02:02 om volta all those folks acknowledged it
02:06 they invented everything that's making
02:08 this show possible einstein invented
02:11 jack [ __ ] okay when you have
02:14 a common medium that not only
02:19 is responsible for everything that you
02:22 perceive as reality and the matrix
02:24 reality
02:24 doesn't matter this would be what
02:27 they're using
02:28 to push us together you have a lot of
02:31 avenues that open up in terms of
02:35 communication
02:38 what if you what if we could prove it
02:40 you know we don't have machines well
02:42 actually we do have methods of sensing
02:44 ether going 50 times the speed of light
02:47 but what if we could
02:48 really harness it and i think there's a
02:50 lot of people that can and again
02:51 when you move your hand you're moving
02:53 ether right it's just not going to turn
02:55 anything
02:56 magical because we're not converting it
02:58 into energy
03:00 from the perspective of it
03:03 anymore tesla's
03:06 warden cliff tower was 100 percent
03:10 dealing with ether his entire vision of
03:13 the world was look we're going to get
03:15 everything switched back to
03:16 ethereal engines which is we think the
03:18 egyptians or the pre-dynastic
03:21 race that was in the egyptian area
03:24 we're pretty certain that the pyramids
03:27 were 100
03:28 energy generating plants which i've
03:31 talked about several times i won't beat
03:33 that up on this episode
03:36 but imagine that um if you're made of
03:39 the same thing
03:41 and there's a way to think about this a
03:43 little bit differently
03:46 my instinct with all the research that
03:48 i've done
03:49 and studying every project that i can
03:52 get my hands on that is like a
03:54 collider type object
03:58 it suggests to me and i've said this
04:00 several times on episodes
04:02 related to ether that we are renewed
04:06 as quickly as possible
04:10 every unit of time that we can measure
04:14 what's that mean well imagine just for
04:16 the sake of argument
04:17 this is probably an exaggeration for
04:19 sure
04:20 but you had a pole going through your
04:23 body
04:24 it comes in the top of your head and it
04:25 goes down the bottom of your feet
04:29 it's not it's never going to be that
04:30 absolute it's going to go at the palm of
04:32 your hands
04:33 any orifice whatever i don't know
04:36 but if you're renewed every nanosecond
04:41 or
04:41 nano nanosecond or however whatever the
04:43 shortest amount of time is if light is
04:45 if
04:45 sorry if ether is moving 50 times the
04:47 speed of light just imagine there's
04:49 going to be a bit of a delay in the
04:50 circuit for a particle
04:52 of ether to hit your scalp start
04:55 generating and regenerating what you are
04:58 and then pop out your foot water
05:01 that acts like a current as i always say
05:04 starts at the top of that little vortex
05:06 and it spins all the way down the little
05:08 tornado and goes down the drain
05:10 or if it's in a river it moves down
05:12 river
05:14 and that provides an ecosystem of
05:17 these particles to travel throughout the
05:20 universe and become
05:21 everything your pencil
05:24 a rock outside your house you
05:27 your brother your sister your mother
05:29 whatever
05:31 beings on other planets beings in space
05:35 maybe some organic being that can live
05:36 in space we assume that can't happen
05:39 because
05:40 when we freeze down to what is it
05:43 zero kelvin or something we tend not to
05:47 move very much
05:49 but perhaps there's something that can
05:51 move because it doesn't need that
05:53 vibrational reality
05:55 or maybe it's made of something else in
05:57 addition to ether
06:00 that would keep it living but let me
06:03 give you a little
06:04 example of sort of what i'm thinking and
06:06 would have been think
06:07 i have been thinking for several months
06:10 since since my last ether episode
06:13 you have to know these subjects that i
06:14 repeat are very near and dear to my
06:16 heart
06:17 so if you go on the playlist and you
06:18 find something being beat up
06:21 it's no mystery to you that i'm
06:23 fascinated about the
06:25 moon hoax scandal of nasa
06:29 so i talk about it a lot we review it
06:31 every once in a while
06:32 this one's gigantic to me because
06:36 i want other more qualified electrical
06:39 engineers
06:40 to hear this content maybe you even know
06:42 someone who is one and they've never
06:43 seen the show they're never going to
06:45 organically find it
06:46 but you point them to the episode you
06:48 just listen to this dude for a split
06:50 second
06:51 understand that ether was a concept that
06:53 only einstein's group got rid of
06:55 a guy that never invented anything and
06:57 who stole everything that he ever said
07:00 he invented
07:01 go see my einstein episode which i think
07:04 is
07:06 was it uh episode 1 or 400 one of the
07:08 two
07:09 501 or or so 401 or it's
07:14 400 somewhere in there but we need to
07:18 start thinking about how we can start
07:20 controlling and tapping into
07:24 the smaller the smallest particle in the
07:26 universe that we know of
07:28 you might say well hey we've got these
07:29 colliders and they're going down to
07:31 corks
07:32 and and so we're already doing as much
07:34 as we possibly can
07:37 i think that your problem is is you're
07:38 now inside an official
07:40 scientific organization that is going to
07:43 hoard information
07:44 never let you know what's going on
07:47 they do satanic rituals in their
07:49 basement in the hadron collider in
07:52 europe i mean give me a break those are
07:54 the people you're going to trust with
07:56 empirical information i don't know that
07:59 they're intelligent enough to actually
08:01 find anything new
08:02 all they've done is memorize and repeat
08:04 things to get their degrees
08:06 and when it comes up to being the elders
08:09 that their state been standing on the
08:11 entire time that they've been alive
08:13 they're like an einstein well what can
08:15 we steal from somebody
08:17 who hasn't revealed it to the world you
08:19 know someone who put in for a patent
08:23 can we steal that and say it's ours just
08:26 to survive one more minute
08:28 in our faux life of being actually
08:30 intelligent
08:31 as opposed to being a memorizer and
08:33 repeater
08:34 what's interesting is it used to be that
08:36 a lot of people
08:38 in this world were very very smart
08:39 especially in first world countries
08:42 and so when you were to go into a room
08:44 and start to pitch something that you
08:45 think is a really good idea
08:47 these elders of the universe both men
08:49 and women remember madame curie man
08:52 the woman that found the first moth in a
08:53 circuit relay
08:56 who got us to coin the phrase she wrote
08:58 down i found a bug in the computer
09:00 literally women you've been involved
09:03 since the very beginning
09:04 einstein's wife was the one that made
09:06 him sound smart
09:08 but when they used to pitch something
09:09 new to a group of folks folks could
09:11 smell bs
09:12 a mile away at least 150 years ago they
09:15 could
09:18 now just repeating the dogma that exists
09:22 on paper will start blowing away 99
09:24 percent of the world
09:26 and therefore they don't have to invent
09:28 anything new
09:29 they just have to keep repeating dogma
09:31 to be called a genius by their family
09:35 no research no critical thinking
09:37 whatsoever
09:38 just a zombie that can repeat
09:42 it's like a bad low end computer i
09:45 learned this today
09:47 did you know this is the way it worked
09:50 so in order to get into the ether
09:52 conversation you immediately filter out
09:55 the blue pill people you filter out
09:57 these
09:59 ignoramuses to pull that over back
10:02 a little bit of malarkey there
10:06 you filter them out and then you only
10:09 have intelligent people in the room
10:12 people who believe that ether exists are
10:14 the folks that have had to
10:16 weather 120 years worth of einstein's
10:20 crap
10:21 and everybody who jumped on his
10:23 shoulders to say that ether didn't exist
10:26 that's a good that's good company to be
10:28 in once you filter out all those morons
10:31 i mean you seriously do and yeah you
10:34 might have a bunch of these people i'm
10:35 calling morons that
10:36 have memorized and repeat repeated or
10:38 memorized let's just say
10:40 encyclopedias of crap that i can't
10:42 repeat back to you
10:43 maybe even some really good stuff if i
10:46 want to know how something works i'll go
10:48 look it up
10:49 and they already know it so i'm not
10:51 saying that they don't
10:52 have a pile of information that's useful
10:55 the problem is they usually lack the
10:57 original thinking
10:58 required to activate that information
11:02 outside of the paradigm boxes that the
11:05 information has been presented to them
11:06 with right
11:07 we look at computer components go talk
11:10 to anybody who's
11:11 electronic specialist if you're not one
11:13 yourself
11:15 you will know that even though we're
11:16 miniaturizing things really really tiny
11:20 i mean ungodly small it's still the same
11:24 old stuff
11:25 the tesla invented refined
11:28 etc etc we're not inventing new things
11:31 that often
11:33 we have resistors and capacitors and
11:36 coils and
11:37 and transistors and diodes
11:40 we're not inventing a new thing much
11:45 even a microchip is full of all those
11:47 basic things printed in a silicon chip
11:50 millions and billions of them and we can
11:53 do amazing things with them once we get
11:54 them made and perhaps we don't
11:56 need a new one perhaps we're good
12:00 the problem with those components is
12:03 that they only work on electron
12:05 theory they rely on electrons
12:08 without electrons none of those
12:09 components function
12:11 all right well that's where a quantum
12:14 computer gets really interesting
12:16 we're finally breaking the mold and
12:18 going subatomic
12:20 or at least atomic to create a new way
12:24 of computing i'll tell you man if i was
12:28 young you know being young in the sense
12:30 that it was like i don't know
12:33 especially 30 or less
12:36 i would be spending all my time learning
12:38 quantum computing
12:40 getting involved with whatever projects
12:42 go get a degree and whatever is going to
12:44 help them
12:44 hire you and jump in
12:47 because that's going to be the
12:49 mind-blowing frontier
12:53 now what the interesting thing there is
12:56 that they're using atoms
12:58 that spin that also have properties by
13:01 which if we resonate electricity through
13:03 them we can actually control their spin
13:05 and freeze it
13:07 but we use the spinning electron to
13:08 figure out
13:11 it basically calculates every
13:12 conceivable number between zero and one
13:15 and we can use those in computational
13:17 algorithms to figure out something
13:19 to explore a maze from every conceivable
13:23 place your feet could be all at the same
13:25 time instead of going into the maze and
13:27 getting lost
13:28 that's not a good place going to this ah
13:30 that's like quantum computer
13:32 marches an infinite number of people
13:33 into the maze and goes i found it
13:36 instantaneously that's exciting
13:40 imagine that we were to acknowledge
13:41 ether again
13:43 in a mass community methodology
13:46 and now the pressure to keep you from
13:48 going down that path
13:50 is getting more and more infinite
13:54 but if you could and we could figure out
13:55 a way to to
13:57 observe and manipulate ether
14:00 not only do we get zero point energy
14:02 systems but we might get a computer
14:05 that runs almost backwards in time but
14:08 so fast
14:10 you just have your computer you know
14:12 spit out an answer randomly in your
14:14 kitchen you're like
14:15 what the hell is this and then you go
14:17 honey you know where'd you put my keys
14:18 and then
14:19 oh wait a minute let me read the fortune
14:20 cookie out of the ethereal computer and
14:22 it just said
14:25 in the bathroom i didn't know what that
14:26 meant until i consciously thought
14:28 because it's already thinking way ahead
14:29 of you
14:30 stuff like that you know in the movie
14:33 altered states i've mentioned it once
14:35 before
14:36 one of the opening act dialogues that is
14:39 mind-blowing and you can see it on
14:40 youtube i think you just go
14:42 altered states dialogue it's going to be
14:45 william hurt talking about trying to
14:47 find the inception point
14:49 of life in the universe which is really
14:52 consummate to the beginning of the
14:54 universe forget the big bang
14:58 and his theory was because
15:01 of the causality model of all things in
15:04 the universe the butterfly effect
15:06 you could you know theoretically reverse
15:09 engineer
15:11 all of the causality of the reality that
15:14 you're seeing today
15:16 but you would have to have just like the
15:18 book chaos says
15:20 you will have to have a capture of all
15:22 the things
15:24 in your area all the particles in your
15:25 area all the things that have ever
15:27 affected anything
15:28 you have to have one snapshot of all the
15:30 particles and all their vectors
15:33 and then you can reverse engineer it
15:35 without that
15:37 you can only get a partial
15:40 probability of what might have caused
15:43 what you're talking about
15:44 what you're asking it about what's
15:47 interesting to me
15:48 is that ether being what i think it is
15:52 and what the you know most brainiac
15:54 people in the world
15:56 figured out let's just say that you and
15:59 i share
16:00 in any one lifetime a few ether
16:02 particles if not
16:04 millions and billions of them meaning
16:06 one that went through me
16:08 and so many hours will go through you
16:11 because it is being pushed around the
16:13 surface of the earth
16:15 hence providing the gravity that we have
16:19 now imagine that there's more than one
16:23 that goes through me and then it goes
16:25 through you this
16:27 chain for whatever reason let's just say
16:29 i'm gonna
16:30 make this up so please don't take this
16:32 literally but what if
16:35 ether particles travel within some sort
16:37 of confined fabric
16:39 meaning instead of being free-flowing
16:42 pinballs flying all over the universe
16:44 they're more like train cars
16:47 in fact there's multiple ether particles
16:49 that make up every car
16:51 there are some interesting binding
16:53 forces which means basically currents
16:56 where they trap each other together
16:57 that's how ether makes
16:59 everything that we see today
17:02 again the current isn't really a current
17:04 the current is just water
17:06 behaving in a way that we call it a
17:09 current
17:10 so verbs become nouns in this world
17:14 well let's just say i have like a
17:16 nucleic chain
17:18 equivalent of etheroparticles that go
17:20 through me and i
17:21 touch them in a particular way i'm
17:24 thinking a particular thought i'm having
17:25 a particular feeling
17:27 at the moment that these things
17:28 transcend through my body
17:32 being a temporary construct right and
17:34 then they float
17:36 to you and they don't change that much
17:39 or they get through four or five other
17:42 people first
17:43 and then they go into you but maybe they
17:44 just go through some rocks maybe just go
17:46 through the air
17:47 something that's not going to be having
17:48 a complex thought as far as we know
17:51 and then there's like a little telegram
17:53 message inside of it
17:55 that i added to it the one that i got
17:58 had other people's telegrams embedded
18:00 in it and if it resonates with you
18:04 let's say the two of us think the same
18:07 then all of a sudden you're picking up
18:10 on my frequency
18:13 one of the catalyst moments about this
18:16 that drove this episode was a comment
18:17 someone made this morning
18:19 which actually would have been yesterday
18:21 the 28th
18:23 he said i can't even believe it was my
18:26 episode about
18:27 the matrix gods and he said i can't
18:30 believe you just said this you made an
18:32 episode about this because i was just
18:33 telling my friends the exact same thing
18:37 wow you know just mind-blowing so i
18:40 thought about that all day
18:42 and i thought that is wild because this
18:44 stuff happens
18:45 we all know that little thing that
18:47 happens when you learn a new word
18:50 and then all of a sudden you hear the
18:51 word everywhere you learn a new concept
18:53 and everyone's talking about that
18:54 concept all of a sudden
18:56 we typically minimize that experience
18:58 because what we say
19:00 or what we tend to do is to look at
19:02 something very simple
19:05 is that you didn't notice it until you
19:06 knew it existed
19:08 well that's definitely a lot of truth to
19:09 that we've talked about that a lot
19:11 if you can't conceive of something then
19:13 you really can't interact with it much
19:16 nor have a thought about it that's why
19:17 when someone accuses you of
19:19 doing something that you can't conceive
19:22 of something bad
19:23 you did this to me and you're like man i
19:26 can't even conceive of having that
19:27 thought
19:28 so there's no way i actually did it to
19:29 you especially not on purpose
19:31 maybe what i did kicked over a few
19:34 different things
19:35 and made you it looked like i meant to
19:38 do that but that's not the truth
19:41 but perhaps the listener is
19:45 tuned to me tune in my voice to one of
19:49 my spirit
19:50 i'm i'm assuming i'm attuned to you guys
19:53 as well to be honest
19:54 but it might be a little easier because
19:56 i'm the one in the camera i got a voice
19:58 there's a there's a resonating
19:59 id to who i am and maybe the even though
20:03 the
20:04 packet of information that's going
20:05 through me and zipping around the world
20:07 and getting to the listener
20:09 because perhaps whatever's bouncing
20:11 around goes through all of us
20:12 instantaneously
20:14 50 times the speed of light well if
20:17 they do those calculations on how fast
20:19 santa would have to go to visit every
20:21 home
20:22 in a night and it's just funny really
20:24 high number
20:25 something like that but perhaps you know
20:29 i record the episodes before i
20:31 air them and so it's bouncing around in
20:33 all of our consciousness
20:35 and then poof you got it you recognize
20:38 the conversation
20:39 it happened to co correlate with
20:41 thoughts you've already had before you
20:43 ever heard i ever existed
20:44 maybe me talking about the matrix or
20:47 talking around the matrix
20:48 kept the listener around to kind of go
20:50 hey you're kind of thinking like me
20:53 truth is i'm thinking like you too
20:56 but it zips through you and you have
20:58 this big conversation
20:59 and then here comes the video the cause
21:02 and effect
21:03 that might be the butterfly effect is
21:06 for whatever reason i can't shake it out
21:07 of my head like i said in the episode
21:09 and then you can't either and so here's
21:11 a little telegram
21:13 that makes sense to you it's a bit like
21:16 when you go get your mail
21:18 today mail at least in america is just
21:21 gobs and gobs of crap and so i don't get
21:24 my mail
21:25 out of my mailbox probably about once a
21:28 week i go get it it's nothing it's just
21:30 a bunch of paper
21:31 versions of bills i have online as many
21:33 times i tell them i don't want any paper
21:34 they still send it to me
21:36 thanks for going paperless we'll send a
21:40 argentina rainforest to your house in
21:42 the next two days
21:44 but what happens you pull all this crap
21:46 out of your mailbox
21:49 without even reading what's on the mail
21:51 you can see
21:52 junk mail you can just feel it with
21:55 blindfold on and just know that's that
21:57 stupid newspaper
21:58 i get that tells me something i don't
21:59 care about you could feel a really
22:02 hard you know 50 gauge or 50 pound
22:06 print which is a postcard from some real
22:08 estate place you just know it's not for
22:09 you
22:11 the minute you start feeling an envelope
22:13 and it starts to feel like a little
22:14 credit card in it
22:16 and you think you have a car coming to
22:17 you well that's the one you keep and you
22:19 open up
22:21 but we look at it and we identify with
22:23 it if we identify with it we keep it if
22:24 we don't we let it go
22:26 and that could be is just as simple as
22:28 the packet information that's going
22:29 between us
22:32 what i can't shake is the following
22:37 we are somehow conscious
22:41 we are alive something is making us have
22:43 that feeling
22:45 i'm always telling you we're symbiotic
22:48 the soul
22:49 body creates the mind in between which
22:52 is a hindu thing that goes back probably
22:54 300 000 years for all i know
22:57 so i'm standing on the shoulders of
22:58 giants repeating
23:01 probably poorly their overall philosophy
23:06 the thing is is we we do have
23:09 definitions for life and i think that's
23:11 extremely important
23:15 but i think we get too myopic
23:18 in our thinking we tend to say this is
23:21 the definition of life and anything
23:22 outside that definition is not alive
23:25 when i was a kid i was told that you
23:28 know animals don't have souls
23:31 and i don't think they were really
23:33 talking about the cats and dogs that are
23:34 domesticated because people
23:36 develop relationships with animals and
23:38 they there's old twilight zone where a
23:40 guy
23:40 dies and he and his dog go to
23:44 the other side and he's trying to find
23:46 heaven
23:48 and of course his dog goes with him
23:49 because his dog has a soul
23:51 but again a friend of mine told me a
23:53 long time ago and what's funny is i
23:55 mentioned to him
23:56 this again he's younger than me i said
23:58 well you know you said that to me in it
24:02 at first i thought you were nuts and
24:03 then i thought well let me put some more
24:05 thought into that and he was
24:06 he was at my house and he goes you know
24:08 i really honestly believe everything
24:10 everything's alive and he pointed at my
24:13 coffee table and he goes
24:14 like i think that could be a life first
24:17 i was like
24:18 what you know like are you just being
24:20 existential for the sake of being
24:21 existential
24:22 like define to me why you think that's
24:24 alive don't just say you think it's
24:26 alive
24:26 i mentioned to that i mentioned that
24:28 back to him about 10 years ago
24:30 i said that i always think that's really
24:32 weird
24:35 but i thought about it i thought well
24:39 i do also believe that a soul is a
24:42 separate thing
24:42 whatever that thing is made out of i
24:45 think that is the tangible
24:47 dimension of emotion
24:51 love whatever
24:54 the question i might you know just put
24:56 out there is it could something be alive
24:57 like a rock
24:59 like a planet native americans thought
25:02 earth was
25:03 mother earth which i think is beautiful
25:08 the way it really makes sense to me is
25:10 that you must well you know
25:12 you don't have to but if you do
25:14 acknowledge a
25:16 substrate that we're all made out of
25:19 then you can start getting into most
25:20 communication protocols
25:23 if you've ever been inside a deep forest
25:28 or even the woods i should say trees
25:31 and you just sit for a second listen to
25:35 your voice
25:36 listen to the voice inside your head
25:38 listen to the universe
25:40 just sit and meditate for a split second
25:44 you know that there's well a bunch of
25:46 you most likely listen to this show
25:48 you've had probably very spiritual
25:50 experiences
25:53 first year i ever surfed
25:56 i always always was told that there was
25:58 this amazing spiritual thing about
26:00 surfing that it wasn't just
26:02 getting on a board and riding a wave and
26:04 i could never understand it until i was
26:05 out there one morning
26:08 it's probably seven o'clock in the
26:09 morning i'm freezing my butt off about
26:10 this time of year
26:14 i'm out with a couple other guys my age
26:16 because we're long boarders
26:17 and there was an amazing
26:21 moment where it was as if i was not
26:24 on planet earth i was in some heavenly
26:27 dimension
26:29 of existence and there was a there was a
26:31 really
26:33 light misty thing going on where the
26:36 the ocean water was very glassy in
26:39 between waves
26:40 and so it was doing that little pitter
26:42 patter of
26:43 almost like sleet falling into the ocean
26:46 it wasn't sleek i don't know what it was
26:50 and that just that harmony of that
26:53 breaking
26:53 of the you know the tension on the top
26:56 of the ocean water
26:57 and sitting on this board and if any of
27:00 you have ever surfed
27:00 just getting out there initially is is
27:04 the daunting thing you know and i did it
27:05 in my 40s
27:07 or probably my late 30s i guess but i
27:10 was not in shape
27:12 but i wanted to take a second to shake
27:15 your mind a little bit
27:18 and this is gonna be i don't know i'm
27:21 gonna see if i can put this into words
27:23 and not spend half an hour doing it
27:27 i think that from birth obviously we are
27:30 taking on paradigms as i've said several
27:32 times
27:33 just to survive you have to understand
27:35 who your mother is
27:36 you have to understand if you're in the
27:38 wild what a breast is or you're not
27:40 going to eat
27:41 then once you get to hard food you're
27:43 going to have to figure that out
27:45 things are dangerous fire don't touch
27:48 you know
27:49 that animal wants to eat you those kind
27:51 of things
27:52 and what i think is that we by the time
27:54 we get to a scientific level of thinking
27:57 even 15 years old but more so
28:00 every decade that passes we get so
28:04 wrapped up in solid-state matter
28:08 big things you know a bb is a huge thing
28:12 when you're talking about ethereal
28:13 particles
28:15 and this super sub-atomic thing
28:18 that we're discussing here that when
28:20 someone comes up to you with subatomic
28:22 physics
28:24 i remember when i was first getting into
28:26 cork research
28:28 because i lived up in the bay area we
28:29 had a collider up there
28:31 stanford library i mean plenty of
28:33 brilliant people to talk to about things
28:36 they um it seemed
28:40 almost like you were going into a
28:45 a difficult thing to think about
28:48 like thinking about an infinite number
28:49 set you're going how do you think about
28:52 that
28:53 it immediately pops your brain in fact
28:55 the more intelligent you are the more
28:56 sentient you are the more
28:58 drug-free you are and you start to think
29:00 about infinity
29:01 you immediately account for every single
29:04 spare slot in your brain that could
29:07 conceive
29:08 of a growing number set and quark
29:11 research felt like that
29:15 so now if i want you to go
29:18 perhaps i don't know how many for how
29:21 many levels
29:21 down below that an ethereal particle
29:24 would be
29:25 but perhaps a thousand orders of
29:27 magnitude down
29:29 man how do you start thinking about it
29:33 the key in my opinion is
29:37 water water is probably where
29:41 i think ethereal particles dance freely
29:45 the same goes for atmosphere gas every
29:48 time i take a puff
29:49 on this cigar and you can see it in the
29:51 camera
29:53 as you meditate and just sort of let the
29:55 clouds flow off the camera
29:57 those movements are 100 percent
30:00 indicative of ethereal movements 100
30:05 as it is above so too as a below is
30:09 it might be the single most brilliant
30:12 scientific statement
30:14 that has ever been uttered or understood
30:16 or transmitted to man
30:18 because it solves all problems however
30:22 what it's really doing in my opinion
30:24 depending on your intellect and your
30:25 scientific background
30:27 or your ability to absorb these things
30:29 regardless of your background
30:31 because you could just be built to
30:32 absorb it
30:35 is that it really when you understand
30:37 that theory
30:40 it's like someone teleporting you to the
30:43 beginning
30:44 of the yellow book road in the wizard of
30:46 oz
30:47 you're right where the munchkins are
30:50 your journey is just beginning because
30:53 where you could go
30:55 in this particular road is not just oz
30:58 but i was gonna be a good place let's
30:59 define oz as the city
31:02 where all ether particles are understood
31:06 where the ecosystem of the city itself
31:08 survives 100 on ethereal motors ethereal
31:10 technology
31:11 and nothing higher than that the other
31:14 one is that
31:16 in the 20th century with the help of
31:19 einstein and a bunch of other folks
31:23 the conservation of energy
31:26 principles out there start to teach you
31:29 that
31:29 all mass and all energy comes in limited
31:33 energy packets
31:35 quantum physics in general will go that
31:37 route
31:39 that immediately starts to get you to
31:41 think that
31:42 everything is very very limited in the
31:45 universe and that if rich people
31:47 can convince poor people to surrender
31:50 all their patents and their knowledge
31:52 and build factories that create
31:53 say electricity that they can now sell
31:57 it to you for the rest of your life
32:00 when if we were just to go back
32:04 even just a hundred years i mean tesla
32:06 was
32:07 alive and well a hundred years ago
32:11 and we tap into his brain and we say
32:13 okay there's a war going on buddy
32:16 you're not going to live more than 20
32:17 years more and they're going to try to
32:19 race you
32:21 so dude do us a favor
32:24 create an invention or create a book a
32:27 few paragraphs
32:29 that will explain to us your perception
32:32 of ether and the universe especially as
32:34 it relates to
32:35 energy generation such that there's no
32:38 pattern
32:40 you're still going to be broke unless
32:41 someone says thank you for paying for
32:43 all electricity in the world you can
32:44 stay in our hotel for free
32:47 so that we can escape this perception
32:49 that we have that we're so
32:51 stuck where we are one of the things
32:54 that's interesting with some of the
32:56 conspiracies out there
32:59 is that we'll have like conspiracy like
33:01 for instance this is not what this
33:03 episode's about
33:05 the moon was placed there there's a
33:07 bunch of books about who made the moon
33:10 uh you know david ike is on this new
33:12 thing in the last five years that he
33:14 says it's a mothership and
33:15 he's got the bowels of it all figured
33:17 out i mean give me a break but anyway
33:19 i respect him very much for what he does
33:23 but moving a moon into place
33:27 how far away is man from ever able being
33:30 able to do that
33:32 a long ways away right because the
33:34 amount of energy
33:36 that we would have to control as man to
33:39 move
33:40 something that's 1100 miles and die in
33:42 radius
33:44 well that's huge but the one thing i
33:47 love about wizard of oz that relates
33:49 back to this episode
33:50 potentially is the wizard
33:53 wasn't a stupid guy but he was a
33:56 manipulator
33:58 he said to the lion look you have the
34:00 courage
34:01 you've demonstrated your courage that's
34:03 why you're here
34:05 tin man you've always had a heart a
34:07 straw man you always got a brain
34:09 and dorothy is the one that applies to
34:11 us
34:12 you've always had the power to go home
34:14 the whole time
34:16 just click your heels there's something
34:19 phenomenal about someone telling you
34:22 who knows that you actually have the
34:25 power to figure all this stuff out
34:28 but we don't get that as a human race
34:32 ever do we just think about it like
34:36 when has anyone stood up at a speech
34:41 and really convinced people besides like
34:44 maybe a graduation speech where they
34:46 you know the elders of the community
34:48 always try to tell the kids how great
34:49 they're going to be and that's a good
34:50 good thing to tell them because they can
34:52 if they want to
34:54 but when does the president of a country
34:57 let alone a monarchy
35:00 isn't it weird how monarchy monarchs
35:01 just hide in their castles all year long
35:04 like why keep these people around just
35:06 blows my mind but someone coming out and
35:08 saying guess what folks
35:10 like let's say it's an an alien race
35:12 that comes down or it could be us
35:14 looks just like us or whatever and they
35:16 say look we
35:17 are you and you are us
35:20 we are at a higher level because we
35:22 didn't grow up inside this container
35:24 that you're growing up in
35:25 but just so you know your dna comes from
35:28 our dna
35:29 we put you in this thing there's a
35:31 little experiment we're going on
35:34 but you actually have in your genetics
35:38 all the knowledge to make this entire
35:40 universe
35:42 the problem is is when you wake up as a
35:44 human being
35:46 as a baby coming out of your mother's
35:48 womb the paradigms of this universe
35:51 are so constraining
35:55 that you never have the budding thought
35:59 to consider any of this and therefore
36:02 it's inaccessible to you
36:04 say after four years tesla was very sick
36:07 as a child
36:10 for a short bit nearly killed him
36:13 and he said that as he was sitting in
36:15 bed which his father i guess
36:17 brought him books to read
36:21 he said he had the epiphanies that
36:22 really gave him the idea that he wanted
36:25 his whole life to be about electronics
36:28 electrical theory i should say later he
36:31 got into electronics
36:33 and so from a very young age he had this
36:37 precept of he can do it
36:41 when he set out to create the ac motor
36:45 he didn't have a doubt in his mind he
36:48 would be able to make it happen
36:49 and many of us have had those moments in
36:52 life where something is impossible to
36:53 most people
36:54 is an undoubtable successful thing that
36:57 you're going to do
36:59 and it's that perception that steve jobs
37:02 reality distortion field they always
37:04 talked about
37:06 it gets people over the hump all those
37:09 engineers those with the 15 people that
37:11 work with steve to make the macintosh
37:13 computer
37:15 half of which are a bunch of douche bags
37:18 who take interviews and money to take a
37:20 [ __ ] on steve jobs
37:22 when without him they wouldn't have been
37:24 anybody they would have been a little
37:26 engineer for a few years of their life
37:28 would have been a nobody forever would
37:30 have participated in nothing significant
37:32 in their life
37:33 but they lived inside his distortion
37:35 field of trust
37:37 and belief that he had in them to get
37:40 the impossible done
37:42 and then he went off and did it again
37:43 for the next computer
37:45 it doesn't even matter if the computers
37:47 were successful
37:49 when you invent something that no one's
37:51 ever seen
37:53 well that's a college degree no one can
37:55 take away
37:56 it's an award that no one can mess with
38:01 so let's just say we are all victims of
38:03 the natural
38:05 progression of life the serendipity
38:08 of life itself but we don't want to be
38:11 like that
38:13 we want to short circuit ourselves
38:16 sometimes you can just stay
38:17 on the fringe i think my whole game is
38:19 that i've been on the fringe
38:20 of for whatever reason reading something
38:24 that's official and then for whatever
38:26 reason i don't know why
38:28 i'd ever had an adult that i can
38:30 remember
38:32 that said oh but this might be wrong
38:35 i probably never pissed off my physics
38:37 teacher more than the day i said
38:39 what if mc squared equals mc squared is
38:42 wrong about the
38:43 threshold of the mass going the speed of
38:46 light
38:47 and i just saw him look at me and just
38:48 kind of go yeah
38:50 don't do that like i'm trying to get
38:52 through the basics
38:53 with these other kids and you're off and
38:56 some
38:58 thing i'm not qualified to talk about
39:01 again if my teacher had the internet
39:02 back in the day he would have
39:04 been a very interesting guy so can we
39:08 shock our system
39:09 into thinking a little bit differently
39:11 and i think yeah
39:12 pretty damn easy you just have to kind
39:15 of say to yourself
39:17 well what works out in
39:20 in a laboratory and it's provable
39:23 is something we can hang on to we have
39:26 to be careful about how we interpret
39:27 what we think we're seeing
39:29 because we could see something and it
39:31 could look like something else
39:32 and we get it wrong these uh
39:36 i'll give an example i just watched this
39:38 funny weird video there's this great
39:40 doctor he's this asian guy very handsome
39:43 dude looks really cool
39:45 he does these um these uh i don't know
39:48 what you call them these videos that are
39:50 about 25 minutes long and he goes and
39:52 finds a case
39:53 where something weird happened to a
39:55 person where they didn't know they had
39:57 ingested a poison
39:59 or something they did a little stunt for
40:02 the internet
40:03 and he talks about how it affected their
40:06 body and how they nearly died
40:07 and i don't think i've ever seen one
40:10 where the patient passes away
40:11 but he just did one where a woman ate
40:13 five-day-old sushi
40:15 from a gas station and nonetheless is a
40:18 working woman
40:20 she came home really tired one night
40:22 knew she's really hungry she knew she
40:23 didn't eat she wouldn't be able to sleep
40:25 so she ate this stuff it took nine
40:27 months i believe before
40:29 she went to the doctor because she had a
40:31 seizure in her house
40:33 well long story short she went to the
40:36 hospital i think up to two times before
40:38 they actually took a stool sample and
40:40 found the fact that she had a tapeworm
40:42 in her body
40:43 and not only did she have a tapeworm she
40:45 had the the species that can grow up to
40:47 30 feet
40:49 as soon as and she was taking b12
40:51 because her body was very depleted of
40:53 nutrients
40:54 because the tapeworm was eating it all
40:56 she was pounding b12
40:58 and it was better for a little while and
41:00 then eventually
41:01 she got bad again had another seizure
41:04 it's because that particular tapeworm
41:06 consumes b12 so it was just robbing her
41:09 of everything
41:10 but so the doctors saw the effects they
41:13 looked in all the books
41:14 compared all their mental knowledge all
41:16 their you know practical knowledge of
41:18 things
41:18 they were getting the diagnosis wrong
41:21 until they looked into a different place
41:22 and then poof they killed that thing and
41:24 she was much better instantaneously
41:27 we are told things and i'm going to give
41:30 you an example that i've
41:31 given a long time ago but it's another
41:34 one of these
41:35 mind-numbing weird things
41:39 and for those of you flat earthers
41:40 you're going to love this
41:42 when we are told in classic astronomy
41:46 cosmology that the sun is this ball of
41:49 fire
41:50 very very huge randomly you know 93
41:53 million miles away
41:54 and some change and that the moon which
41:57 is an elliptical orbit
41:58 which vacillates up to 5 000 miles
42:02 in its elliptical orbit around earth
42:06 but we have i think it the number is is
42:09 if you stand in any place on planet
42:10 earth
42:11 during a clear day every 27 years you
42:14 can see a solar eclipse
42:17 and the moon completely blocks the sun
42:19 perfectly
42:20 where you get this block it's only for a
42:22 split second then you get the ring of
42:24 fire on one side
42:26 and then it it's over
42:30 i saw one of these when i was nine years
42:31 old in kansas
42:34 and i i don't know if it was 100 eclipse
42:36 but my god the whole
42:38 neighborhood turned black night it was
42:40 like six o'clock in the summertime
42:45 so we are told that this random ball in
42:47 space
42:48 and this other random ball in space
42:50 although
42:51 millions of miles away from each other
42:53 okay
42:54 for all intents and purposes the sun is
42:57 93 million miles away from the moon too
43:00 but the radiuses are perfect such that
43:02 solar eclipses happen every
43:04 year somewhere on earth how's that
43:07 possible
43:09 i mean we swallow all of the cosmology
43:13 but like many people have recently
43:15 discovered in the last
43:16 five years we are really relying on a
43:19 ton of information that we can't confirm
43:21 as human beings
43:23 given to us by organizations that are
43:26 wrought with corruption
43:28 some some of it's for vanity some of
43:30 it's for control
43:33 some of it's so that tenure professors
43:35 don't have to learn anything new
43:36 their whole life imagine if you're a
43:39 history professor
43:40 and you became very informed about the
43:43 civil war
43:44 and you teach that in the college a
43:46 bunch of advanced courses in the civil
43:48 war
43:49 and you know obviously you're going to
43:50 teach it with lessons involved and
43:53 and things and as time progresses you're
43:56 learning more information as more
43:58 history is discovered but overall you
44:00 get to kind of focus and even if nothing
44:02 else is discovered about the civil war
44:03 era
44:04 you still have a boatload of information
44:06 that new students do not have in their
44:08 mind therefore you are useful
44:09 your whole life but now imagine you're a
44:13 pangaea drift person
44:16 and someone reminds you and tells your
44:19 students hey you know what that's all
44:20 crap
44:21 it's expanding earth really sorry all
44:24 the proofs in the pudding
44:25 the proof's right there on the surface
44:26 of the earth you'd have to be in some
44:29 huge huge pie of denial
44:32 to not acknowledge it this is something
44:35 the flowers people have to deal with as
44:36 well
44:38 okay so you tell the 10-year professor
44:40 who's been teaching pangaea drift for 20
44:42 30 40 years
44:43 you got to change your game bro it's all
44:45 wrong
44:47 the peter projection map of the earth
44:50 reshapes all the continents on earth
44:52 they generally look the same but they're
44:54 elongated vertically
44:56 they've been trying to get that into the
44:58 schools and i think massachusetts
45:00 two years ago decided to go ahead and
45:02 get rid of all the normal globes and go
45:04 to the peter projection map
45:06 because they want kids to know the truth
45:08 about the shape of things
45:11 well this 10 year professor is going to
45:13 have to be an innovative cat man to go
45:16 yeah
45:17 i want to risk my entire career
45:19 switching over to this other paradigm
45:21 of which is actually older than pangaea
45:26 but what happens the oil companies go
45:28 hey you can't be teaching expanding
45:30 earth because that teaches kids about
45:32 methane gas turning into crude oil thus
45:34 making it not a fossil fuel
45:37 so these are the precursors i guess i
45:39 did just take a half an hour 20 minutes
45:40 to do that
45:41 but these are the precursors in my mind
45:43 that have to be conquered
45:44 before we're going to be able to have a
45:46 decent conversation
45:48 about what might actually be putting
45:49 this universe together
45:52 if you're a matrix person what's
45:54 interesting about the ether being the
45:55 medium by which the matrix
45:57 illustrates our reality is that you
46:00 could do probably time travel
46:02 because we're actually not moving around
46:03 the universe like we think
46:06 for those of you who've had to digest
46:07 you know when you're young you just
46:09 think i'm just going to make a time
46:10 machine we'll go back in time makes
46:12 sense
46:12 and then you realize if they if we're
46:15 really hurling through the universe at
46:16 some
46:17 incredible speed well when
46:20 lincoln existed it was millions
46:24 gazillions of miles away from where we
46:25 are now so to go back in time and see
46:27 even the light that
46:29 reflected off of his body you can't be
46:31 where we are you have to be where he was
46:34 but imagine time travel is possible the
46:36 dark five guy
46:38 had an episode on dark five is the
46:41 channel it's dark
46:42 files is this other one i think it's on
46:44 dark files but he talks about
46:47 one of the two channels this invention
46:50 that the vatican has rumored to have
46:53 that is very much like the one in
46:56 what the invention allows you to do
46:58 supposedly is it's like a frame
47:01 and you look into it and you can see the
47:02 past
47:05 it's all hokey you know again if they
47:07 had that kind of power
47:09 we wouldn't be in the place that we are
47:10 now we'd probably be in some horrible
47:12 universe
47:13 because again i mean i don't know maybe
47:17 maybe looking only into the past would
47:20 be
47:21 limiting if you can't travel to the past
47:24 and
47:24 change somebody's life thus changing the
47:26 future
47:27 maybe it's just an interesting way to
47:29 kind of know what really took place
47:32 but if time travel were possible on any
47:34 level it would have to be a matrix in my
47:36 opinion
47:38 because maybe all a time machine would
47:40 really do is
47:41 interrupt the program that is us
47:46 remember time bandits little maps they
47:48 could travel through
47:49 these portal doors and go anywhere in
47:51 time and play in place that they
47:53 wanted to they're all little back doors
47:55 that were left behind by god
47:57 there was a map of them all
48:00 we're all worried about you know
48:02 apocalyptic moments
48:04 taking away our luxuries of life that we
48:06 have become completely dependent on
48:09 at least in our current form with
48:11 ethereal knowledge what's interesting
48:13 about it is that you would never
48:15 if you have just a basic knowledge of
48:16 how ethereal particles can be harvested
48:18 in a
48:21 either a taurus shaped
48:24 object or even a solid bowl that's made
48:27 of a conductive metal
48:29 like a brass solid bowl you could turn
48:31 it upside down hang it from a tree
48:33 pull leads down off of it and you can
48:34 run a little motor off that
48:37 well you know you're in the forest and
48:40 you got some electronic stuff that needs
48:41 a little bit of power
48:43 you could at least go well at least i
48:44 could turn this thing on
48:46 i can't run electric
48:49 motor tesla car but if charging it up
48:53 and you get the minimum voltage to
48:54 create a charge maybe you could who
48:56 knows man
48:58 when i sit in my backyard and do these
49:00 shows
49:02 there's just a part of me that when i
49:03 look at a tree look at a bush look at a
49:06 bunch of ivy it's bizarre how i feel
49:10 an age of a personality from each plant
49:15 not just the consciousness but i feel
49:17 its age i feel almost its
49:19 attitude towards reality i feel like
49:22 some things
49:23 that bloom a lot and have shorter
49:25 lifespans
49:27 they are a little bit more kind of like
49:30 wild animals where they're just like
49:31 we're just living we're just surviving
49:33 we're just procreating you do your thing
49:35 when i look at a tree i feel like i'm
49:39 looking at an elder
49:40 that is for whatever reason i get a five
49:44 that it's much more interactive with
49:46 human beings
49:47 than other plants i don't know why
49:51 you wouldn't question the fact that a
49:53 plant is alive
49:54 but because it doesn't have eyeballs and
49:56 legs and speech capabilities that we
49:59 have been able to create
50:02 we tend to think they're not alive
50:06 in a way that is conscious we can
50:08 minimize them chop them down
50:10 determine toothpicks no problem
50:13 you ever wonder why when you eat food it
50:15 translates to energy
50:18 you're thinking well god i wonder how it
50:19 does that i want to meet a bunch of
50:21 vegetables
50:22 how does that translate into energy
50:25 if you think about ethereal particles
50:27 and the fact that
50:28 currents of ether particles constitute
50:31 everything that we
50:32 acknowledge as mass then simply
50:36 absorbing those ethyl currents which
50:39 have force
50:41 turns into power
50:44 because an electron is the collision of
50:47 dielectric wave
50:48 and the magnetism wave hitting each
50:50 other well guess what
50:52 you could actually be a organic being
50:54 that could ingest
50:56 anything and everything will have
50:58 electrons in it
50:59 and you're just peeling off the part of
51:02 the energy
51:04 frequency that your body just happens to
51:06 evolve to have been
51:09 if you haven't seen the movie lucy with
51:12 scarlett johansson
51:14 which is a luke bassan film i mentioned
51:18 it a few times but i'm going to mention
51:19 it a slightly different context now
51:21 the movie is about a girl who's attached
51:23 to this bad boy
51:24 who gets himself involved in a drug deal
51:29 and she gets captured as a piece of
51:31 collateral
51:33 and they're he he's involved with being
51:36 a physical drug mule
51:37 where they put the drugs inside your
51:39 body and you fly through customs and
51:41 then you have surgery and you make so
51:42 much money you don't have to do that
51:44 one time in your lifetime well
51:48 he i think he gets killed or something
51:51 the boyfriend
51:52 then she gets captured knocked out a
51:55 bunch of
51:55 crazy drugs in her gut i don't even know
51:58 if this drug is a real drug
52:01 but she lands and she gets abused
52:04 by her captor and he kicks her in the
52:07 gut a bunch
52:08 and that ruptures the bag that's inside
52:11 of her gut
52:12 so she ends up taking in this mega
52:15 mega dose of this drug and it starts to
52:19 have profoundly positive effects on her
52:21 being
52:22 in that she starts to really see the
52:25 universe for
52:27 probably what it's made out of without
52:28 labeling anything
52:30 and the scene in the movie that's the
52:32 most fascinating to me is when she steps
52:34 outside for the first time
52:37 and she looks up at a tree and she looks
52:38 at humans and she looks at all things
52:40 and she can see life force going through
52:42 everything
52:44 it's a bit like neo in the matrix in
52:48 1999. right at the very end of the movie
52:50 he's looking down the hallway
52:52 and all those letters are dropping right
52:54 but the letters are making up
52:55 all things and making up the hallway the
52:57 floor the um
53:00 agents was it mr smith's
53:04 at the end of the hallway
53:08 and what happened they shot a bunch of
53:10 bullets at him
53:12 and he just said i don't think so and he
53:14 just went
53:15 put his hand up and all the bullets
53:16 stopped and dropped to the ground
53:19 he had evolved like lucy
53:22 in a totally different manner within the
53:25 matrix which is very interesting
53:27 such that he could just grab those
53:29 bullets and say i don't think so
53:31 there are all these rumors okay that
53:35 people who have meditated in asia those
53:38 tibetan
53:39 temples had reached a level of
53:43 sort of immaterial existence where they
53:46 could walk through walls
53:48 again i had a story told to me
53:51 by a i think it was a roadie for
53:55 rolling stones rolling stone excuse me
53:58 and he was they were touring over there
54:00 he took a vacation over there or
54:02 whatever and he had hurt himself
54:05 or gotten sick or something and they
54:08 crawled all the way up this tibetan
54:10 temple because they were miles and miles
54:11 like hours and hours away from
54:13 modern civilization they got up there
54:16 and of course the locals are talking to
54:18 the monks and they don't really want to
54:20 be disturbed and finally they said okay
54:23 we can fix you but you got to go over to
54:25 that that place over there and they
54:26 pointed off the hillside
54:28 mountainside at another temple meaning
54:31 they got to go all the way down
54:32 which took hours and crawl all the way
54:34 up and here he is not feeling well
54:38 he said that when they they immediately
54:40 left immediately started going down
54:43 three or four hours later whatever it
54:44 was they got to the other temple
54:46 and all the people that they had met
54:50 at the other temple we're at the new one
54:53 and they're like how's that possible the
54:56 american guy
54:56 or actually was english he goes uh
55:00 the guy looked like rod stewart was
55:01 funny he said
55:04 i asked him you know how the hell did
55:06 you get here because
55:08 we were the first ones down the stairs
55:09 and you didn't pass us nobody passed us
55:12 we didn't see any other human beings
55:13 how'd you get here
55:15 and through translation the dude went
55:18 well we just came here we go went from
55:21 there
55:21 to here and the guy was kind of
55:24 embarrassed to tell me a story but he
55:25 was just i don't even know how he got on
55:26 the subject but
55:28 he told me that story and i was just wow
55:32 okay what if these stories aren't
55:36 embellishments what if they're real
55:39 the stories about finding people's
55:41 skeletons you know
55:43 embedded in stone walls
55:46 as if they had just frozen walking
55:48 through the wall
55:49 like they lost their concentration or
55:51 something
55:53 it begs the question of how powerful the
55:55 human mind might be
55:57 to control its own resonating frequency
56:00 through sheer meditation
56:03 what if you need training wells and the
56:05 training wells that you need are nothing
56:06 more than
56:07 these sound bowls the frequency that
56:10 will release you
56:11 from your so determined frequency to be
56:15 in this particular
56:16 reality to be able to touch everything
56:17 you can see is this bowl this bowl has a
56:20 frequency that will free your mind
56:23 and then your body because we're all a
56:25 vibration no matter what
56:28 what if it's not a joke that the or not
56:31 an example
56:32 that's incorrect that the ether does go
56:34 through your head
56:35 first which is the way
56:38 we perceive it to go through the planets
56:41 through the top
56:42 then the bottom i mean what's top and
56:44 what's bottom whoever conquers the
56:46 hemisphere first gets to call it north
56:48 probably that's the way it is
56:51 but what if it's just a mere thing that
56:54 we stand on earth
56:56 okay and ethereal pressures is what
56:58 gravity really is
57:00 and so of course it's just going to hit
57:01 the top of your head first
57:05 and let's just say because that's the
57:07 little junction point between your soul
57:08 and your brain stem
57:10 what ends up happening is you can
57:13 actually
57:14 control the ether yourself i mean
57:16 obviously we're controlling ether
57:19 because we can create thoughts you want
57:20 to go and imagine something well then
57:23 you're imagining electricity moving
57:25 around inside your head
57:27 potentially you're imagining it from
57:28 your soul down don't know but i do
57:31 believe your brain gets a copy of the
57:32 thought
57:34 they're starting to try to uh you know
57:36 hook up
57:38 sensors to the back of your head so they
57:39 can see your dreams they can see your
57:41 thoughts
57:42 total sci-fi 30 years ago and they're
57:45 getting better at it and better at it
57:46 every day
57:48 well what if you're controlling this
57:49 overall frequency of what's going
57:51 through you
57:52 such that someone just meditates at the
57:55 conscious level in the brain
57:57 and you are resonating and moving
58:00 the the vibration of the new ether going
58:03 through your body
58:04 thus resonating slowly in a gradual
58:08 linear curve
58:11 all of your body and if you just simply
58:14 can be pointed at the right frequency
58:18 you can achieve this amazing existence
58:20 that's more ethical
58:22 those that astral project we think we
58:25 see
58:25 ufos we think we see aliens
58:31 at least for the last i'd say 15 years
58:35 we've heard the more advanced theory
58:36 about the fact that the
58:39 ufologists now believe that maybe these
58:42 individuals are
58:43 here with us but they're in a different
58:45 dimension of existence
58:47 slash observable reality
58:50 like all the sci-fi movies that have
58:52 frequency dimensions and that sort of
58:54 thing
58:57 and that they're merely vibrating into
58:59 our frequency
59:01 those portals that they the dude in
59:03 newport the kid in newport filmed
59:05 where if you just look up newport ufo
59:09 portal
59:09 you'll probably our newport california
59:11 ufo portal
59:13 you'll see what i'm talking about this
59:16 white light shows up in the sky and gets
59:18 bigger and bigger and bigger like a tear
59:20 and all these little white circular
59:23 things start to fly out of it and they
59:25 start to dance together and stuff
59:26 whether it's science fiction
59:28 you know or sorry special effects or
59:29 something i don't know you could
59:31 definitely do it
59:32 definitely do it lock a camera down a
59:34 tripod fill in the sky
59:36 cg it in and then run a filter on the
59:39 footage to shake it like it's uh
59:41 being moved around a lot yeah you can do
59:43 that
59:45 that's without tracking but you can see
59:48 hopefully by now this potential
59:52 that is right there for the taking
59:55 a new frontier in in consciousness and
59:58 thought
60:00 and what if it's let me give you a very
60:03 interesting thing
60:04 at least in my opinion we know at our
60:07 level
60:08 we have a very collapsed
60:11 paradigm of existence meaning we don't
60:13 see much
60:14 we have a very small envelope that we
60:16 live inside of
60:17 at least unless you watch this show or
60:19 you're someone that would watch this
60:20 show
60:22 and so we have conversations like this
60:25 one to
60:26 peel away that paradigm and start
60:28 opening it up
60:29 and it gets kind of messy when you open
60:31 it up because every potential
60:34 thing that could happen in your mind has
60:37 to be evaluated and there could be a
60:38 very busy
60:40 noisy chaotic phase of your life where
60:42 you're evaluating
60:43 99 crap to find the one percent
60:46 needle in the haystack that's got some
60:48 validity to it
60:50 none of us most likely have laboratory
60:52 equipment
60:54 so it's all observable reality thinking
60:57 and
60:57 maybe a little bit of stuff in the
60:58 backyard but not much
61:01 but what if those that control the world
61:05 maybe they're aware of some of these
61:06 things being real but they
61:08 lack because of their their obsession on
61:12 control
61:12 their obsession on luciferian crap
61:17 they they realize well i don't like
61:20 thinking because thinking is hard
61:23 and so as long as you tell me my my
61:26 minions
61:27 who sell their own people out for a
61:30 paycheck
61:31 as long as you tell me that they are not
61:32 thinking about these things and that
61:34 you're going to use my money
61:36 and my power structure to get rid of
61:38 them if they happen to have the thought
61:42 then uh i'm good just not thinking about
61:44 anything let's just not even try to go
61:46 there
61:46 let's just let i own the whole world
61:48 whatever
61:49 okay so if you're luke skywalker in the
61:53 middle of some
61:54 iowa farm and you start thinking like
61:58 this whether it's serendipitous
62:01 or somebody suggested that this might be
62:03 possible
62:04 but you're the first person to figure it
62:07 out
62:08 to go somewhere do something different
62:11 to do some alchemy and some magic just
62:13 by thinking with your mind
62:18 then you start to become a little
62:19 superhero
62:21 and get enough of these folks going
62:23 where that person actually figures out
62:25 how they did it
62:26 and they could describe it to their
62:27 cousin their brother their sister their
62:29 buddy
62:30 and then that person could do it and you
62:33 have to watch how do you tell these
62:34 things to because you know when lex
62:35 luthor getting that power
62:38 well maybe taking back the world might
62:41 be a lot easier
62:43 i know it's a fanciful thing to say
62:47 we already know that thinking outside
62:49 the box
62:50 is now being penalized by them they tech
62:54 your political parties that hate it when
62:57 you love life
63:00 to bring it into 2020
63:03 right now you're a lot of people are
63:05 scared to be in the same proximity of
63:06 another human being
63:08 we're being conditioned and the morons
63:10 are right there man
63:11 they're right there to make sure that
63:13 you don't talk to the people you love
63:15 the most
63:17 i got these uh i got two friends of mine
63:21 that had to have their holiday plans
63:24 canceled because
63:25 the family thinks they caught this thing
63:28 nobody is suffering from any symptoms at
63:30 all but somebody took the test
63:33 the tests aren't being tested right what
63:35 is it the guy invented the test said 94
63:38 false positives that's pretty bad would
63:40 you take that test i wouldn't take that
63:41 test
63:42 why so they're trying to in this
63:46 particular year
63:47 start the process that they want to last
63:50 forever
63:50 where we are terrified of being together
63:54 hmm what revolution ever started with
63:57 one person
63:58 none that i'm aware of and so we have
64:02 a few mediums for the time being to
64:06 study and share like crazy
64:10 but let me throw this scenario at you
64:12 before we finish
64:14 let's say because morons are more
64:17 prevalent than people like you
64:20 that everyone just keeps sucking on this
64:22 hose
64:24 they just keep swallowing all of this
64:25 propaganda
64:27 and for whatever reason let's say your
64:29 military is on board because they'll all
64:31 take a paycheck to go to hell
64:33 that's really what it's going to be
64:34 about whatever hell is they're going to
64:36 find out
64:38 and so they enforce this nutty crap
64:42 so now you're quarantined yourself so
64:45 now all you have is your mind you can't
64:47 get any more money talk you can't talk
64:48 to your buddies
64:49 or anybody believe me as crazy as this
64:53 sounds
64:54 okay they are going to figure out a way
64:58 to demonize zoom calls
65:02 for health reason and you think that's
65:05 crazy they're going to do it
65:06 they're gonna try to make any type of
65:08 communication illegal
65:10 maybe you don't take the vaccination and
65:12 they say that you can't
65:14 have a zoom call unless you can prove
65:15 you've had it i mean they're gonna do it
65:17 trust me if we don't make a huge change
65:19 here real short
65:22 all right and you're stuck by yourself
65:25 that's why you're going to want to
65:26 absorb as much
65:29 open-minded thinking just the formula
65:32 for it forget the subject forget ether
65:34 forget anything specifically
65:36 you're going to want the archetype built
65:38 into your mechanics of your mind
65:41 to be as sharp and as healthy as it
65:44 possibly can be
65:45 before that kind of thing occurs
65:48 if you value that type of communication
65:51 then you have to stand up and fight
65:52 against
65:54 any of this stuff that's going on it's
65:56 baseless
65:58 i keep seeing these memes to digress for
66:01 one second on this note
66:03 where people are comparing spanish flu
66:06 to 2020.
66:08 there is no comparison whatsoever
66:10 between that event
66:11 and today zero okay
66:14 that's a completely different thing
66:17 and that thing h1n1
66:21 killed i think safely we can say
66:25 and the people try to go with the low
66:26 estimates the low estimates are
66:28 30 million people dead not infected
66:32 dead but the real numbers are probably
66:35 more
66:36 like 75 to 100 million people the
66:39 country of india reported 20 million by
66:41 themselves
66:42 so these ridiculous estimates of 30 is
66:45 absurd
66:46 i think polynesians lost a double-digit
66:49 percentage of their entire population
66:52 this was nightmarish
66:55 nothing they put on their face ever
66:58 helped them
66:59 ever ever probably helped them from
67:01 getting other stuff
67:02 but not this one so don't let that one
67:05 get thrown in your face
67:06 to rationalize taking away your ability
67:09 to be
67:10 free and think the way you want to think
67:12 the sad thing about ethereal
67:13 technologies
67:14 is that you don't have any formal place
67:18 to go
67:18 in the universe uh i should say the
67:22 world i always do that
67:23 to have this conversation intelligently
67:26 however i was on a business call
67:30 probably three months ago we did some 3d
67:32 work for a group
67:34 and the ceo was uh
67:37 rallying on about something very
67:39 interesting about our project
67:41 and then i don't know how it worked out
67:42 but
67:44 i was showing him some prelim stuff from
67:46 the 2001's
67:47 intro and i said well you know i usually
67:51 don't tell folks this but since my
67:52 buddy that you met me through knows
67:54 about this might as well and i said you
67:55 know
67:56 i got this channel and i said you know
67:59 i'm into a lot of things
68:01 and i said you know one of the big ones
68:02 i'm in is heathrow technologies and the
68:04 dude goes what
68:06 and he goes man i'm i'm a huge ether guy
68:09 he's a brilliant dude and i was like
68:12 really and so we got to talking and he
68:15 says send me your episodes on ether and
68:17 so i picked out a few of my faves and
68:19 sent him over to him
68:20 never heard back from but he's a busy
68:22 guy
68:24 but we also have this re-emerging
68:27 pre-dynastic research on egypt super
68:30 exciting
68:31 whole new frontier man and so when you
68:35 take this
68:36 theory in there for instance i was
68:39 watching some um
68:41 i was showing dark fight to a friend of
68:42 mine and it was on some
68:45 episode where he was talking about wild
68:48 natural anomalies and he was talking
68:49 about there is this
68:51 gravity anomaly
68:54 on the earth's crust and it was at a
68:57 point where
68:57 a what they thought was a meteor impact
68:59 had occurred
69:01 maybe maybe it's an earthquake you know
69:04 or a big blob from the beginning of the
69:06 earth's crust being formed
69:08 whatever but they couldn't figure out
69:11 why this
69:11 uh gravity anomaly occurred where
69:13 gravity seemed to be
69:15 less at this particular location than
69:18 every other place on planet earth
69:21 and i turn up my positivity i turned my
69:22 butt and i said look
69:24 here's what's going on ether is gravity
69:27 ether pushing down on human beings and a
69:30 non-permeable ball we call the earth
69:32 is gravity it's a push not a pull
69:36 that crust is thinner at that impact
69:38 thus the ethereal
69:41 existence of plasma at the center of the
69:43 earth is now bubbling
69:44 up from that thinner part of the crust
69:47 thus things have a
69:48 slightly less weight to them
69:52 because they're getting ether up their
69:54 hole as well as through their head
69:58 there you go problem solved the dude
70:00 actually ended up mentioning something
70:02 about scientists theorizing this might
70:04 be occurring because the crust is
70:05 thinner
70:06 but because they've got this bogus
70:08 definition of gravity
70:10 which would make it unified around the
70:12 world because the world has
70:14 its mass and because they think it's
70:16 particles pulling against particles
70:18 a thin crust wouldn't change anything
70:21 you go to ether models solved
70:23 instantaneously
70:25 those are the great things you can
70:27 figure out and listen to
70:29 traditional science and translate it
70:31 translate to be bogus like the big bang
70:34 or translate something legitimate like a
70:37 thinner crust on earth supplies more
70:40 equilibrium between the push and the
70:42 pull or there's two pushes basically
70:45 making you a little bit lighter
70:48 it doesn't take long to look at
70:50 megalithic structures to find out that
70:53 yeah you know we probably
70:57 i mean let's just say that you believe
70:58 in um
71:00 the giant human beings the native
71:02 americans show the first
71:04 europeans that came over where the
71:06 smithsonian stole all the bones and lost
71:07 them
71:09 even if you had a bunch of 25 foot human
71:12 beings
71:13 you do not change the overall weight of
71:17 a bath salt 100 ton
71:18 box or potentially a thousand ton box
71:21 before it's carved out
71:24 you don't much to 25 pound 25 tall
71:26 people 25 foot tall people are not going
71:28 to exponentially
71:30 turn them into ants that can hold you
71:32 know 100 times their weight
71:34 or a thousand times their weight but
71:36 ether
71:38 immediately start solving the problem
71:41 now i will tell you that there was one
71:43 part of my video that i forgot to
71:45 mention
71:46 in that megalithic series i did the two
71:49 there's a rock they found in south
71:50 america then when cut into an
71:53 h shape puts off an amazing
71:56 electromagnetic field around it
71:59 and they made a bunch of these things
72:02 but when they
72:02 find this rock natively in a mountain
72:04 and they put a compass up to it
72:06 it doesn't move at all cut it into an h
72:09 shape
72:09 with a bunch of inset
72:12 angles into the h it moves a
72:17 compass because it's changing the
72:19 magnetic pull around it
72:21 so what i forgot to mention was what if
72:23 you were to create
72:25 thousands of these h's literally
72:29 and when linked together
72:32 they start becoming exponentially more
72:34 powerful but because they are in a chain
72:37 there's a limit to the exponential
72:39 amount of energy that they put off
72:41 but now you take a big ass rock that
72:44 would normally weigh
72:46 100 tons and you push it over the h's
72:49 you know it's tough it's tough to get a
72:51 bunch of humans to get her over the h's
72:53 but all of a sudden now it weighs a ton
72:58 and then you just build whatever you
73:00 want to build
73:01 take up the h's put them someplace break
73:04 them down for some other reason
73:05 leave some of them behind which is why
73:06 we found some of them
73:08 heathrow technology way before the wheel
73:14 it's just serendipitous man
73:17 it could be that one of these rocks
73:18 might have formed into an h-like
73:20 shape and somebody realizes that when
73:24 you put a rock on that particular weird
73:26 rock
73:27 it floats
73:31 and so they just kept building more and
73:32 more and more until magic happened
73:36 technology's lost once the culture
73:37 disappears
73:39 and we find ourselves buying units of
73:41 power
73:44 we find ourselves in the 21st century
73:48 unable to build the pyramids
73:52 this is why this stuff is utterly
73:54 fascinating to me
73:57 if you're interested in ethereal
73:59 sciences
74:00 i can't recommend anyone more than eric
74:02 dollard
74:04 in his lectures sometimes lectures have
74:07 nothing to do with ethereal technologies
74:09 and sometimes
74:10 they're sometimes they'll just pass over
74:13 he'll present a bunch of ethereal stuff
74:14 he believes it and so he's like yeah
74:16 that's the way it works whatever
74:18 and you're like oh my god go back you
74:21 know
74:21 so you're gonna have to ingest quite a
74:23 bit but again
74:25 you might be the missing link
74:29 in all of this observational reality
74:32 you're going to see it
74:33 and sometimes it's going to occur to you
74:34 that it's not according to me or anybody
74:36 else on planet earth
74:37 8 billion people let's say and you're
74:39 the only one that knows
74:41 that's why i want to encourage you guys
74:42 to reach out take some time out of your
74:45 life
74:45 if this is remotely fascinating to you
74:48 and see if you can see something new
74:51 what i haven't done and what i need to
74:53 figure out is that
74:55 there is a way to create a wire at least
74:58 seven feet long
75:00 a couple meters and you can wave it
75:04 in the air and that's the way that the
75:08 og electronics guys electrical guys
75:12 figured out the ether exists it
75:15 you know dollar did it at like 11 years
75:17 old so that dude knows i just don't know
75:19 how to get a hold of that guy
75:22 so it allowed them to notice ether
75:26 and also determine its speed
75:29 and that's phenomenal to me just a very
75:32 easy little experiment
75:35 so let's see what we can do here and
75:37 let's uh
75:38 check the temperature because it sure
75:40 feels like it's cold out here
75:42 well it's still 44 degrees fahrenheit
75:45 all right
75:46 that's our number anyway if you haven't
75:49 been to deepthoughtsradio.com please go
75:51 there and bookmark it just in case we
75:52 get moved around by big tech
75:54 we will always exist in some form or
75:56 fashion if nothing else the videos will
75:59 be posted somewhere and i won't delete
76:01 the channel i think that's always a
76:03 weird thing people do
76:05 i mean because if i have an epiphany of
76:07 some sort and think oh my god those are
76:09 worst videos i've ever made in my life
76:11 maybe so but it's like a tattoo it's
76:14 part of your life
76:16 on there we have video audio social
76:18 media
76:19 all renew mastered season one a store
76:23 and two ways to contribute to the site
76:25 for those of you who are passing me
76:26 donations through paypal thank you so
76:28 much
76:29 again normally it wouldn't be a big deal
76:32 but in 2020
76:33 every penny helps while i'm resetting my
76:35 career over to 3d
76:37 and waiting for hollywood to turn back
76:38 on in terms of script evaluation
76:41 but anyway take care of yourself and
76:43 someone else and i'll see you in the
76:44 next deep thoughts
76:45 over now
76:54 [Music]
77:05 [Music]
77:12 [Applause]
77:14 so
