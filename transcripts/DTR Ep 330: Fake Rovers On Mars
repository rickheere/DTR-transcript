00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen merry
00:38 holidays and I'm assuming this will go
00:40 out in 2019 this is the tail end of 2018
00:43 for me
00:44 today's episode is a request from a
00:48 patreon Daniel and it's one I've been
00:54 wanting to do for a long time and I
00:56 think we're at this beautiful sweet spot
00:58 where it's time like the data is
01:01 starting to ramp up a lot I don't know
01:05 if any one of you have noticed but NASA
01:07 is sort of in panic mode
01:09 about their reputation lots of movies
01:14 getting greenlit tons of articles
01:17 pushing these little astronauts out to
01:20 talk a lot getting the current ISS
01:22 actors to do lots of interviews about a
01:25 raw raw stuff going on and I think that
01:31 there really is sort of a dangerous
01:34 thing happening right now now regardless
01:39 of what you think about Donald Trump I
01:41 can tell you this much I don't believe
01:45 for a second that he believes that we've
01:47 ever been to the moon he had in tons of
01:50 his presidential speeches it's almost a
01:53 common staple now definitely was a
01:56 basketball player
01:57 I don't follow sports at all but he came
02:01 out and I guess was in some interview
02:03 made a flippant comment about the fact
02:05 we didn't go to the moon and they they
02:07 grabbed him and they I think he said
02:11 that President Obama called them because
02:13 this is when it occurred and then they
02:14 had some astronauts call him so he fell
02:19 hook line and sinker of course the guy
02:21 has no academic background to contest
02:23 any data he was just you know saying
02:27 [ __ ] repeating stuff he didn't
02:29 understand but they went after this dude
02:32 and got him straightened out Joe Rogan
02:36 he spoke his mind he he did understand
02:40 enough to prove that we hadn't gone to
02:42 the moon but he wanted to syndicate his
02:44 show make millions of dollars and so
02:46 they said well you
02:47 have to straighten out your opinion on
02:49 the moon a couple interviews manis he's
02:54 totally thrown all the logic that he
02:55 perfectly understood out the window and
02:57 it's probably speaks to his character at
03:02 both of them actually because they're
03:03 they're both respecting their elders
03:06 which we should be able to do when your
03:09 elders start lying to you it's a
03:12 slippery slope
03:13 right now sometimes our elders sly to us
03:16 to protect us
03:18 you know circumcision for male men are
03:22 male boys I should say was designed to
03:24 prevent health problems related to being
03:29 unclean you know having bad hygiene back
03:33 in the day we don't longer have those
03:35 issues in most of the world does not as
03:39 paramount as it was right but this
03:42 episode obviously as you can tell by its
03:44 title is about the Mars missions and the
03:47 current cash cow of fakery that this
03:51 thing is turned into and again you know
03:56 it's one of these things of like I think
04:00 we have to weigh it by someone's saying
04:03 let's just say the president United
04:04 States Donald Trump knows that we didn't
04:06 go to the moon he's been briefed or he
04:09 always knew I mean his uncle was the
04:11 head physicist at MIT so the family is
04:15 not hurting when it comes to brain cells
04:17 yeah you know his uncle was the guy that
04:20 seized all of Tesla's inventions after
04:22 he passed away so the government thought
04:26 that that family was pretty intelligent
04:27 but now what if somebody kind of comes
04:30 at you and says there's a few reasons
04:33 why we lie about these things okay I'm
04:36 open-minded
04:37 shoot tell me what you why you're doing
04:40 this they say well we are in a struggle
04:43 of paradigm beliefs in this world from
04:46 communism to democracy it's best that
04:51 well it's typically endorsed more by the
04:55 people the more powerful a particular
04:57 paradigm is because weak minded people
04:59 just want to be on the winning team no
05:01 matter
05:01 what right they could sell babies for
05:04 food as long as they think that's the
05:06 winning team they don't care and that's
05:08 a super [ __ ] feeble mind
05:10 feeble-minded person right and it's
05:14 obviously do harm for the perceived
05:17 greater good right of their own personal
05:19 benefit and then there might be another
05:22 paradigm that says okay we're faking
05:25 this but get this we need to employ tons
05:29 of people in our country to develop this
05:32 cutting-edge technology that will
05:36 eventually make some of these things
05:37 possible well it's hard without a
05:41 project to learn a skill right if you
05:44 want to learn carpentry you better make
05:46 yourself a project and you're gonna
05:47 build the dresser you're gonna build
05:49 those shelves etc right and so projects
05:54 really help this is what I've always
05:55 taught you on this show about my own
05:57 personal life so why not make real
06:00 projects to send spacecraft into low
06:02 orbit the entire time attempting to
06:05 solve all the problems to get into high
06:06 orbit and eventually leave the Earth's
06:09 gravitational pull and get to stars and
06:12 planets in our solar system stars
06:15 galaxies etc so you could tell a Donald
06:18 Trump or any other president for that
06:20 matter sir madam this is why we push
06:25 this look here's the cost-benefit
06:28 analysis for how much money we spent
06:30 versus the technology our country has
06:32 been able to develop to put into defense
06:34 dah-dah-dah surveillance tyranny serfdom
06:38 for our people is in this great and
06:40 they're like I love it
06:42 right and you couldn't stop that
06:46 industry if you wanted to it's part of
06:49 the military-industrial complex it's
06:51 part of Los Alamos labs it's part of
06:53 area 51 and and wright-patterson Air
06:57 Force Base all this technology gets used
06:59 someone's got to pay for it so it's a
07:02 cover story all right now some people
07:06 just might be able to go well I can see
07:08 the the danger if we elect the wrong
07:11 people select slash allow them to steal
07:14 the elections
07:15 the wrong way then we'll get tyranny out
07:18 of all this will have some thx 138
07:21 silver faced by cop prodding us with
07:24 cattle prods right everyone should see
07:29 that movie
07:29 thx 1-1 3-8 it's not a Michael Bay movie
07:33 it's a thinkers movie and you probably
07:34 got a sea of two or three times to
07:36 really understand all the messages that
07:39 are in there and to think that Lucas
07:41 came up with that story as a young man
07:43 is quite astonishing but Mars hmm what
07:49 did NASA learn by faking it to the moon
07:55 they realized that man they got caught
07:59 they got caught hardcore why they get
08:02 caught well that little thing is right
08:05 up there and we can look at it with
08:08 ground-based telescopes pretty easily we
08:12 can see the surface saw pockmarked by
08:14 volcanic eruptions which we mistakenly
08:17 call craters I mean they're still
08:19 craters but they're not craters made by
08:20 flying debris they also realized by
08:24 claiming that a man could get there and
08:29 back that they further complicated the
08:33 evidence no one really worries about a
08:36 machine going through the Van Allen
08:38 belts although anyone who understands
08:40 miniaturize technology should also
08:42 understand without some sort of
08:46 massively reinforced Faraday capsule
08:50 that this thing would have to be encased
08:52 in you can't get through the Van Allen
08:54 belts with a bunch of electrical
08:55 equipment without running the risk of it
08:57 vaporizing again the atmospheric
09:02 temperature could also pose a problem
09:06 again NASA tells you that the particles
09:09 out there in space are so far apart that
09:11 it's not to be anything to you know it's
09:14 not you not to be concerned running into
09:16 a particle vibrating it the equivalent
09:19 thermal temperature of 48 hundred
09:21 degrees Fahrenheit it's just not a
09:23 problem I wouldn't want to hold one of
09:25 those particles in my hand but whatever
09:28 so Mars is a beautiful target for a
09:34 space agency that is full of a hundred
09:36 percent lies what's one of the most
09:39 classic lie archetypes in human history
09:45 I'll tell you somebody tells you they
09:49 did something but you weren't there to
09:51 see it the old the old I caught a fish
09:56 this big story why did that become a
10:00 famous archetype of a story because well
10:04 the guy's gonna reach his hands out just
10:06 enough to win the the boasting game
10:10 within the little drugstore or whatever
10:13 with old frisbee and it's not gonna be
10:19 too big because then you won't believe
10:20 it but the key thing is I did this and
10:25 you weren't there and by god I wish you
10:26 were there because this was the the
10:28 biggest thing it's like Tenacious D and
10:31 the tribute song the tribute song is the
10:34 most hilarious comedic musical rendition
10:38 of this archetype they said they met the
10:42 devil and they sang the most incredible
10:44 song ever to beat the devil and the song
10:47 that they're singing right now isn't
10:49 that song because they can't remember
10:50 how that song went they said this is
10:52 just a tribute but you got to believe me
10:54 it was amazing the real song it's
10:58 [ __ ] brilliant right so that's what
11:01 Mars is right
11:04 Mars is I did something so far away that
11:07 you can't see oh except they have a
11:10 little piece of trickery for you right
11:14 they bring back photographs now here's
11:20 what's interesting if you go look up
11:23 missions to Mars and you look at the
11:26 whole portfolio of everyone who's ever
11:28 tried to go to Mars you will see failure
11:32 after failure after failure until we
11:38 fake the mission to the moon
11:40 then all of a sudden all this [ __ ]
11:43 starts succeeding orbital missions the
11:46 Viking missions one of the Mars missions
11:49 the Russians named him after the Mars
11:51 Mars one two three four five six seventy
11:53 and again no one you know they forever
11:58 Russia had a hard time just getting
12:00 their Mars orbiter into Earth orbit then
12:05 they get one to go out about 65 million
12:07 miles and it would stop transmitting
12:09 today we supposedly have three
12:13 functional Rovers on Mars two old ones
12:16 one from 2001 one from 2003 and then
12:21 this recent one in 2018 if you're
12:24 waiting for me to answer the question of
12:26 do you think we have Rovers on Mars I
12:28 think the answer is unequivocally hell
12:31 no hell no you know this would be a bit
12:39 of a repeat for previous episodes right
12:43 but my thing is it's an out of sight out
12:46 of mind
12:47 I kind of fish this big story if you if
12:52 I came to visit your house and I said I
12:56 ran inside from the backyard and I said
12:59 hey hey there's a UFO in the backyard
13:05 well you're gonna be excited but usually
13:09 you're gonna want me to prove it take
13:12 you outside point you see it right there
13:14 and by god it's the weirdest little
13:16 thing you'd ever see in your life and
13:17 it's behaving intelligently and maybe
13:21 it's you know these these you see a
13:22 little window and there are little dinky
13:24 people in there and you're like holy
13:26 [ __ ]
13:27 that thing is real everything just
13:30 changed in your life right you just you
13:32 know you believe in aliens and you're
13:33 like who's God and who is Jesus and
13:35 braaap braap right with the Mars mission
13:40 hmm
13:43 it kind of boils down to any scientific
13:47 mission that is successful in space
13:49 makes man think that man is amazing hey
13:55 I don't think I need a Mars mission to
13:57 actually have that same opinion we're
13:59 pretty cool we got some serious stuff to
14:02 fix but overall you know I'm talking to
14:06 you through an electronic device that
14:07 was invented by someone many many years
14:11 ago I bought it I'm recording myself
14:12 you're listening to me whatever a year
14:15 you're listening to me and write that
14:17 that kind of proves to me that we're
14:19 pretty phenomenal Russia tried and tried
14:22 and tried to get to Mars at the time
14:27 that they were trying to go to Mars in
14:29 the 60s very early 60s here they are
14:33 dominating space they got the first
14:35 satellite space first animal in space
14:37 man in space two-man mission in space to
14:41 vehicle mission in space first female in
14:42 space at the end of the space program
14:45 they had the biggest boosters again Elon
14:49 Musk just like two days ago wrote a
14:52 little tweet I guess that turned into a
14:54 big article saying Lockheed and Boeing
14:59 should be embarrassed that the Russians
15:02 have created and still maintain the best
15:05 booster in the world and you know
15:09 thankfully he gave out some big props to
15:10 the booster you know he was like look
15:12 guys Russians have made a beautiful
15:15 motor and it's sad that you can't figure
15:18 out how to do it but you know we use
15:23 them for all of our launches that's
15:24 crazy
15:25 like I said when they found the boosters
15:27 from 1973 hidden away in a Siberian
15:30 warehouse that Russia had completed a
15:33 year after we had finished our fakery to
15:37 the moon these boosters remain
15:40 two-and-a-half times more powerful than
15:42 boosters made and designed with 1995
15:45 technology that should tell you how
15:49 unbelievably more advanced they were
15:51 than us
15:52 and they could not get to the moon
15:55 we know that the Russians faked footage
15:58 of being in space we do they've admitted
16:02 it they've been caught there's
16:03 above-ground documentaries on it nASA
16:06 has never had the balls to to admit the
16:10 same thing I think there was some
16:13 backdoor negotiation between the two
16:15 countries to say okay now you got caught
16:18 yourself you know claiming that one guy
16:21 went up when he never went up I forgot
16:22 exactly the thing they lost a guy too
16:24 burned up really badly but I think that
16:28 when they learned that the space race
16:30 was nothing more than Hollywood against
16:32 Hollywood
16:33 I mean Rockets are going up rockets are
16:36 blowing up like crazy the amount of
16:38 launches that we had in the 50s the 60s
16:40 that just fell down and exploded was off
16:44 the charts so I mean there were some
16:46 real innovation going on people were
16:48 really trying to get this to work I
16:50 think Russia was entirely delusional
16:52 about their capabilities of beating us
16:55 in a Hollywood game I mean ask yourself
16:59 I mean how diluted would you have to be
17:00 to be a Russian citizen in 1959 look at
17:04 your ability to make film and look at
17:06 America's ability to make film and the
17:08 history of the two I think that you're
17:11 going to beat our special-effects that
17:14 was a bad miscalculation on Khrushchev
17:17 side the Doug Trumbull and Stanley
17:22 Kubrick just came in as like two two
17:26 guys with massive IQs and creativity
17:29 right they had smarts and they had
17:31 intelligence and they had just the right
17:34 brain swimming in their their souls and
17:38 they were able to just create 2001 a
17:40 Space Odyssey and hit a grand slam I
17:44 mean the ball never even hit the [ __ ]
17:46 bleachers it went way off into the next
17:49 town over well everything from the
17:52 Soviet Union looks silly so what's going
17:55 on what's going on with these Mars
17:56 missions I mean Rockets launch you get a
17:59 little bit of a on camera a fuselage you
18:03 know shot and then as soon as it's
18:05 supposed to exit orbit and it's big
18:08 slingshot [ __ ] theory the camera
18:12 goes dead and you won't see a camera
18:14 again until the thing that's inside the
18:17 capsule reaches mars goes through its
18:20 full landing procedure and hits the
18:22 ground then you wait and then you get a
18:27 picture back
18:28 you know grossed out lens cover why
18:33 don't you get to see the slingshot work
18:35 because it doesn't work that's why why
18:39 does the camera go off because they have
18:41 to change feeds back in the 60s and so
18:43 they kept that [ __ ] science that
18:45 there's some [ __ ] you know
18:47 interference in the signal again that
18:52 might have been the case in 1969 if that
18:54 [ __ ] science was real but today we
18:56 have something called memory and RAM and
18:59 a cache and you could put a 4k camera
19:02 off the side of a rocket and any time
19:06 you lost the ability to feed it directly
19:07 to live feed you start caching it and
19:10 any any frame of the animation that is
19:14 not validated by ground especially when
19:18 you're super close to Earth's orbit it's
19:20 no big deal right you broadcast it back
19:23 to the earth and we say got it got it
19:26 got as soon as we say we didn't you know
19:28 there's no confirmation back to the
19:29 rocket the software pauses and it
19:31 continues on the same frame until that
19:32 frame is accounted for it's like you
19:34 know tcp/ip packet failure technology
19:37 right and technically speaking we have
19:40 supposedly so many satellites in space
19:43 that at no point should we ever lose the
19:45 feet anymore okay so you can't
19:47 communicate with earth okay there's a
19:49 hundred satellites within a thousand
19:52 miles of where you are in space at any
19:53 one point in time bounce that off a cell
19:55 tower bounce it off some other
19:57 communication tower or not tower I mean
19:59 satellite right nope we lose the feet so
20:04 what ends up happening to the rocket
20:08 well it either orbits and falls back
20:10 down to earth and there's nothing inside
20:12 of it so the profitability of that
20:15 rocket is very high right you're paying
20:19 for the the rocket
20:23 some [ __ ] and you know holding the
20:25 top together you got some multi-stage
20:27 stuff you got some fuel and that's all
20:29 it does is it goes up burns out falls
20:31 back to the ocean and within a certain
20:33 amount of time
20:34 here comes Hollywood to tell you where
20:37 the thing went now right there and in
20:41 that part of the recap you're gonna have
20:44 baby boomers and maybe really stupid
20:47 young people ask the question you know I
20:52 just don't think anyone would lie to me
20:54 ever right the government always tells
20:57 the [ __ ] truth and you know yada yada
21:00 yada right those of you who are left are
21:05 those that are unequivocally the hope
21:08 for Humanity just cut those other people
21:12 off they're useless they're [ __ ] mouth
21:14 breathers whatever
21:15 maybe they pull their head out of their
21:17 ass and join humanity and truth which is
21:21 what the universe needs to be made out
21:22 of that's what it is made out of what we
21:24 need to make ourselves out of mentally
21:27 but don't worry about anyone else stay
21:31 on target
21:31 right now what happens next has been
21:34 planned before the rocket ever launched
21:36 which is scientists real scientists will
21:41 sit down and plan a mission they'll pick
21:45 a robot the pick a design they designed
21:49 the mission just like a fictional writer
21:51 like Asimov or a Heinlein or philip k
21:55 dick person would design a story and
21:59 they say okay well I think this you know
22:02 this should be able to do that well what
22:05 are we going to do to up the game
22:07 against the other ones the Odyssey that
22:09 would landed was a 2001 what are we
22:12 gonna do to beat these things that are
22:14 already up there and then we need to
22:16 make it science fiction so it's
22:18 technically plausible how long do we
22:23 think this mission will go we have our
22:25 fake map of Mars they've literally made
22:28 a fake terrain of Mars but just like any
22:31 one of you who've ever role-played there
22:34 are
22:35 about your map once the GM the Dungeon
22:38 Master the game master lays down the map
22:40 to play a role-playing game
22:42 you cannot just invent a mountain
22:44 tomorrow unless you had it on the map
22:46 originally now you can embellish you can
22:49 say well I said there's some mountains
22:51 there but what you learn is that they're
22:52 full of caves and merit right so we're
22:56 seeing some [ __ ] in December of 2018
22:59 which we'll get to regarding the fact
23:02 that they suddenly found a big ice thing
23:05 inside of a volcanic spouts that's
23:08 dormant or whatever as one of our
23:11 listeners said they have already scoured
23:15 the surface of Mars supposedly with
23:18 their reconnaissance satellites which
23:20 are still in orbit today it's still
23:21 sending back information I think it was
23:23 one pixel equal three meters squared
23:25 which means they would have seen this
23:27 thing a long time ago and adduced this a
23:29 long time ago so it is utterly [ __ ]
23:33 laughable they're pushing this stuff on
23:35 us right now in 2018 but anyway at JPL
23:40 behind locked doors they are sitting
23:44 there crafting these stories maybe it's
23:46 at NASA a little bit here and there but
23:48 there's a whole there's a whole group of
23:50 people that have to work together on
23:52 this thing I'm sure in their mind
23:55 they're selling hope right we're gonna
23:58 fake it till we make it like I said in
23:59 the previous episode now when they come
24:02 up with the story they're going to come
24:06 up with the exciting first act of the
24:09 movie which is how did it land what are
24:11 going to be the new big surprises within
24:14 the first 48 to 72 hours the society is
24:17 going to latch on to it's going to go
24:19 out into the press and pull in all the
24:21 interest to these space organizations
24:25 right again inspiring a kid to become an
24:28 astrophysicist is not completely
24:30 horrible becoming a physicist in general
24:32 getting into these Sciences so that we
24:34 can potentially get out there for real
24:37 at one point that's great why we
24:40 wouldn't want
24:41 I mean why they don't think that natural
24:44 inspiration to achieve these things is
24:46 better which it is
24:48 is beyond me but again scientific people
24:52 have you know pretty good pretty good
24:55 Swiss clock stuff on the left half of
24:57 their brain and they have like manure on
24:59 the right half I mean it's like a
25:01 dormant [ __ ] cavity on the right side
25:04 of their head just [ __ ] cobwebs
25:05 nothing's ever grown there before it's
25:07 this rotted prune of a brain on the
25:10 right side so that's why they think
25:11 stupid thoughts sometimes you're
25:14 socially inept that's how they got to be
25:16 smart in the first place right
25:17 unfortunately the people that stand out
25:21 in this world the people that have both
25:22 brains really well developed which
25:24 hopefully is every single one of you but
25:26 once they get the sort of script in
25:29 place then you sort of have your line
25:32 producer comes in and they figure out
25:35 all the assets and everything that needs
25:37 to happen per sentence per scene per
25:40 second per minute
25:41 to sell the first act to the people
25:43 meaning we got to have these CG
25:46 renderings we have to have maybe the
25:48 physical set that's up there in Iceland
25:50 and some warehouse somewhere something
25:52 underground whatever the hell they're
25:53 faking this [ __ ] they have to prepare
25:56 all those assets and they're they're
25:59 sitting there going okay now this is not
26:02 a normal Hollywood movie so this is a a
26:05 faraway planet that doesn't that we
26:08 don't have any actual information about
26:09 and so when we run the software what are
26:14 the things that we need to make sure
26:15 stand out when you're selling this to
26:19 the press when you fake that we land in
26:21 their ones high-fiving each other what's
26:24 important and that's when the scientist
26:25 sit and speculate well you know do we
26:29 want to play the water card yet no you
26:31 know the water card is we've already
26:33 been down this route it's it's a big
26:35 [ __ ] hassle because as soon as we say
26:37 there's water then we're gonna have to
26:38 explain it and stuff and it's going to
26:40 give hope that we're gonna be able to
26:41 put man on there to take baths and the
26:44 middle of volcanic spouts so they make a
26:47 shot list just like a movie right every
26:53 shot has its like if you ever seen a
26:55 shot list sheet like a call-out sheet
26:58 for a shot you know there's usually some
27:00 sort of thumbnail as to what they want
27:02 shot to look like all the attributes of
27:05 any type of the camera settings or
27:08 apertures colours filters anything
27:11 that's the detail about that shots in
27:13 the little call-out sheet then it gets
27:16 reviewed and reviewed and reviewed and
27:18 reviewed and then they they execute now
27:25 how do they create the fake imagery for
27:27 Mars well you're gonna have a couple
27:31 probably techniques they could at great
27:36 risk to themselves within a certain
27:38 paradigm of focusing a camera build an
27:41 actual set and take an actual picture of
27:44 the vehicle on some set now that's very
27:51 risky shots from live action sets on
27:55 earth they're gonna have a couple
27:56 different attributes in my opinion one
28:00 they're gonna have to be super close-up
28:02 shots of surface geological microscopic
28:07 shots and that way you don't have a
28:09 terrain you don't have the sky you don't
28:13 have to count for anything it could be a
28:15 shot that I take in my backyard I have a
28:19 bunch of patio rocks big giant rocks
28:22 over here to my right if I were to take
28:24 one of those rocks and I had some wild
28:26 you know
28:28 granite cutting bandsaw my garage and I
28:32 carefully you know set it up to the cut
28:34 with some water blade or whatever and
28:36 then I take a big picture of the
28:39 cross-section of this thing and then I
28:41 filter it to be sepia tones some rust
28:43 color I could pawn that off as a rock I
28:46 found on Mars
28:48 it's risky though because then you might
28:52 have geologists look at the texture in
28:53 the rock and go well that's just [ __ ]
28:56 granted we have that here on earth and
28:59 then they might do some more math and
29:00 figure out that can't be created on on
29:02 Mars it's not big enough that have
29:04 enough gravity to create that kind of
29:06 rock because it needs more squishing
29:08 power to create making that up but it's
29:11 risky when they landed in 2003
29:16 phors two of them in there actually
29:20 started the Beagle went in 2003 and
29:21 screwed up because britain can't be
29:24 allowed to have its own space program I
29:25 think our other thing landed in 2004 the
29:28 last of the two robots that are sitting
29:31 up there are the Rovers that are up
29:33 there still they said they found these
29:36 little tiny round rocks
29:39 the kind that john cleese said would
29:41 float on water and monty python' quest
29:45 with a little grill but they said these
29:47 rocks don't happen naturally on earth
29:51 and then like ten years later I was
29:56 watching something looking at something
29:57 and those exact rocks happen here on
30:00 earth and it was a joke but what was
30:03 happening with a little rover they were
30:05 cutting these rocks in half right so
30:06 really close-up shots again that's how
30:08 you get a live-action to happen now
30:10 recently there was a funny shot that I
30:12 believe Dave posted on our on our locked
30:18 Facebook group page where it was a shot
30:20 where the the new robot which I forgot
30:22 its name already took a picture of
30:24 itself straight down from a higher
30:27 camera well at that point you have no
30:30 horizon you have no sky you have nothing
30:33 you know around you you have to account
30:34 for it was this Rover basically in sand
30:37 with a nice little footprint in the
30:39 upper right hand corner which was
30:41 hilarious
30:41 okay human footprint so there's a
30:46 limited amount of live action that's the
30:48 point I'm trying to make now there are
30:51 other live-action claims which is shots
30:54 from Iceland and Greenland where nASA
30:59 has a bunch of vehicles and they [ __ ]
31:02 they have replicas of everything that's
31:04 on Mars up there taking pictures and I
31:08 you know they say these things have been
31:10 debunked but I've seen with my own eyes
31:13 a nasa.gov shot where I'm looking at the
31:16 URL in my browser of a terrain and then
31:20 some dude who was I think in Greenland
31:22 and he said there's the other shot
31:24 there's the shot that is the same came
31:26 from this is a famous little Ridge that
31:27 tourists will come and take a picture of
31:30 and they're the exact same location
31:31 one's been turned into rust tone it just
31:34 goes one ear and one ear out the other
31:36 right
31:37 the fake press the fake news doesn't
31:40 cover any of that stuff because they're
31:41 all in it to win it right they make a
31:44 [ __ ] ton of money off of the fakery
31:47 right if they only ran the real story
31:51 they would triple their money okay all
31:55 right so what's the other imagery made
31:57 out of a little bit of a broken record
32:01 here but I'll try to go quick the people
32:04 who made the first computer-generated
32:06 imagery for movies like Tron ended up
32:09 working at JPL for over 13 years
32:12 creating 3d rendering terrain software
32:17 when I asked them why they did that I
32:20 said are you taking in like telemetry
32:22 data or surface data from satellites and
32:24 then plotting it so we can see what
32:26 these things are looking at no no we're
32:28 just making simulation software Peter
32:31 Hyams 2010 Space Odyssey again
32:36 exhibition out of GPL in the making of
32:38 the [ __ ] movie this CG Jupiter which
32:42 again today looks a little silly but let
32:43 me tell you back in 2000 Erdos scuse me
32:46 I'm gonna give them your right 1984 when
32:49 that movie came out we're all sitting in
32:52 the theater just with our jaws on the
32:54 ground how unbelievably realistic that
32:56 thing looked and so they had that
33:00 technology in 1984 they just need a
33:03 better surfaces and if you don't think
33:05 that they intentionally dumbed down the
33:07 Hollywood versions to make us feel like
33:09 they have the in capability of
33:11 photo-real you crazy not today
33:14 that doesn't happen very often we go for
33:16 for the gusto you make it look as
33:18 realistic as possible movies like
33:20 gravity again 90 percent if not 95
33:24 percent that movie is all CG only when
33:27 Sandra Bullock goes to the side of
33:28 capsule and her whole body's visible do
33:30 you see her and then everything else is
33:33 just hands and face oh man you know
33:35 attached to CG bodies until she gets
33:39 back to earth but today
33:42 there is a product called taragan it is
33:45 a brilliant product it came out of these
33:47 intelligence agencies and it became a
33:51 public product and it was rough around
33:53 the edges for the public at first
33:55 because they're not running it on
33:56 supercomputers you're running on a
33:57 personal computer or eventually a render
34:00 farm which has tons of memory in tons
34:02 the processor power to get every single
34:04 pixel correct again the guys I talked to
34:07 work for GPL said it can render any
34:10 terrain that we have on earth a forest a
34:13 beach a desert every grain of sand if
34:17 you've got the memory okay alright I
34:21 said how good is it indistinguishable
34:24 from reality Steve Jobs sat at a wooden
34:29 table in 1993 on a promo tour for Toy
34:33 Story and bragged at the table he had a
34:35 guy with a PhD in 3d rendering terrain
34:40 rendering design oh ok and you have to
34:46 understand Pixar Pixar literally hired
34:50 the first I would say experts in the
34:56 world for a 3d rendering software I got
35:01 heavily heavily heavily into this in
35:02 1988-89
35:04 and I had a boss it was a genius in this
35:06 and he turned me on to all the books he
35:08 said there's only a couple books written
35:10 on the subject right now in the world
35:12 and he goes you got to go get him as
35:14 soon as I opened up the books all the
35:16 Pixar films were in there I mean they're
35:19 the early ones the the unicycle one the
35:22 ball with the stripe and the star on it
35:25 was in there they were the the Faraday
35:32 Tesla's of 3d rendering okay but
35:35 software still has to be operated by
35:37 mortal human beings it's created by
35:39 mortal human beings as well well
35:42 everyone's seen at least the preview if
35:44 not the movie of Matt Damon's Martian
35:48 movie right where the story is that they
35:51 get they go to Mars and they land and
35:53 they mess around they're supposed to
35:54 leave but a bunch of
35:55 it goes wrong because a sandstorm comes
35:58 along and tears up their base and they
36:02 may not get home okay the terrain you
36:05 saw and the movie Martian is all
36:08 Terrigen as I am told by people in the
36:12 industry okay sometimes you don't know
36:15 exactly what software some of these
36:16 films use you hear stories one of my
36:19 close best friends in the entire world
36:21 former co-host of MKULTRA radio two-time
36:26 Emmy Award winning 3d artist uses
36:30 Terrigen all the time I think goes I can
36:32 do Mars all day long so I got really
36:35 good first-hand knowledge about that
36:37 product I have downloaded and rendered
36:39 stuff and Terrigen myself it's
36:43 phenomenal you can get a copy of it but
36:45 now Terrigen didn't know it was exists
36:47 when we were first doing our Viking
36:52 mission which supposedly sends back you
36:55 know several thousand photographs what a
37:00 lot of us don't know and I wasn't aware
37:02 of it at the time because life got busy
37:04 was that we have been supposedly sending
37:06 things to Mars like every few years
37:08 since the 60s since the Russians and I
37:13 say we as in humanity the Russians tried
37:16 tried tried failed failed failed failed
37:17 I think they're telling the truth I
37:19 think that's what's interesting about it
37:20 but again once we did them the moon
37:22 mission then we automatically landed on
37:25 them on Mars because we figured out the
37:27 [ __ ] game and then I think in 71 or
37:30 so 73 somewhere in there the the
37:34 Russians automatically pull it off
37:35 because they're like okay [ __ ] you
37:37 guys are faking this [ __ ] to the moon so
37:39 you know what we know exactly how you
37:41 pulled that off and if you don't want
37:43 any trouble you better keep your mouth
37:45 shut when we talk about us landing on
37:47 Mars with the probe but that meeting
37:51 happens between those scientists they
37:53 got they write the script they write the
37:54 big popper act 1 they know no one gives
37:57 a [ __ ] about whatever acts are written
37:59 afterwards they simply don't there's a
38:01 little bit of a heartbeat every once in
38:03 while a little pinch point in the script
38:04 again yesterday or two days ago this
38:07 article comes out they found water on
38:09 right little pinch point in the script
38:11 you're interested again aren't you
38:13 it's not gonna last for that long but at
38:15 least for now you think that your
38:16 money's being spent well investigating
38:19 the the Red Planet
38:21 Elon Musk came out today this morning
38:23 and he he debuted this new nose cone of
38:27 a stainless steel rocket he plans on
38:29 building to go to Mars again he drops
38:34 some mad science about it goes well you
38:37 know stainless steel is actually better
38:38 than other surfaces the carbon fiber
38:41 stuff we've used and you know paint
38:44 won't stick to it so it's gonna be a
38:45 completely shiny you know chrome pill
38:49 that's going to go into the air they're
38:51 gonna be using their new renditions of
38:56 boosters which again he automatically
38:57 said weren't as powerful as the Russians
38:59 so what the hell's old Russia back right
39:02 by the way they're killing the [ __ ] out
39:04 of Orange County today
39:05 day after Christmas at least they left
39:08 us alone yesterday so these meetings
39:11 continue though because the scientists
39:13 will continue mulching the data making
39:16 sure that what they want to accomplish
39:18 in this mission makes sense it's the
39:21 next evolutionary accomplishment and
39:25 Mars exploration and you know quite
39:27 frankly if it wasn't in the real world
39:30 let's say we could really get there
39:31 every mission to Mars should continue to
39:34 push the envelope
39:36 stop landing in boring [ __ ] places
39:38 and then just driving around in boring
39:40 places that's all we've ever done is
39:42 just be so mystified by you know some
39:47 mild surface again my astronomy teacher
39:50 in high school told me there's a volcano
39:53 on our like ex volcano on Mars it's 15
39:57 miles high well we uh cording to NASA
40:01 there's this giant tear down the center
40:03 there are getting these pyramid-like
40:07 structures which are probably natural
40:09 formations if they were to exist it's
40:11 probably [ __ ] but those exist those
40:14 clusters will get your ass over there
40:16 and take a picture of it right you don't
40:17 have to land right on top of the damn
40:18 things you can land a couple hundred
40:21 miles away [ __ ] if the things are going
40:23 to set up
40:23 for 15-20 years [ __ ] story about
40:25 their capability of running forever I
40:27 mean there's not a [ __ ] electric car
40:29 on earth that has ever run that goddamn
40:32 long
40:32 okay let's first let your cars are all
40:35 dead their batteries are dead what what
40:38 the hell are they making the batteries
40:39 out of on these Rovers that they just
40:40 last forever where's that technology for
40:43 us right
40:44 my cellphone can't run for four years
40:46 but this goddamn Rover on Mars can run
40:48 forever uh-huh there's no ionization
40:51 inside the battery again what do you
40:53 what are you running this thing on right
40:55 again these these Rovers sure you know
40:58 enduring massive dust storms they always
41:01 survive because they flap their wings
41:04 they flap their wings and dust
41:06 themselves off huh larious right yeah
41:10 because we use that technology on earth
41:12 to get things to be not dusty absurd
41:17 plus anything electronic has a natural
41:20 attrition to it surface is ionized and
41:24 valence is no longer have the
41:27 conductivity that they used to have but
41:30 these groups keep meeting and then the
41:32 preliminary renderings start coming in
41:34 from the CG team look at it hmm you know
41:39 okay well what kind of you know give me
41:41 the top-down look at this terrain okay
41:43 maybe point the camera a little bit more
41:44 like this a little more like that you
41:46 know this Ridge right here is very
41:48 aggressive why don't we tone that down a
41:50 little bit because I'm not sure you know
41:52 the geological team came back and said
41:54 this probably is impossible to be
41:56 created okay now whether or not they use
41:59 Terrigen I I don't know they could use
42:02 their own SuperDuper version of it I
42:04 would imagine they've got their own
42:05 proprietary version but why not use
42:07 something off the shelf it really saves
42:10 you a lot of R&D and testing because
42:14 what happens when the pictures don't
42:15 work oh then you get this [ __ ]
42:18 mission briefing that the the probe
42:21 crashed into the surface of Mars because
42:23 of a metric standard conversion problem
42:26 mm-hmm but just like a movie
42:31 the preliminary start turning into final
42:34 candidates right FC's well this looks
42:38 pretty damn good I think what do you
42:40 guys think and they just mull over it
42:42 and mull over it right till they finally
42:45 approve one image and there may be again
42:48 an upgrade in the camera that they're
42:51 using the 3d camera they're using to
42:52 reveal more about the surface details
42:55 and that's the big pitch that's the big
42:57 new thing that we're gonna be doing
42:59 they're probably not how many of you
43:02 wake up every morning right now and look
43:03 at all the images coming in from Mars I
43:07 would wager very few of you and why is
43:10 that
43:10 because it's not that exciting plus they
43:14 don't really roll them out as fast as
43:15 you want them now if the rover is truly
43:18 existed transmitting transmitting a 4k
43:25 image or even higher to earth from a
43:30 rover would take probably the majority
43:33 of its battery power to perpetuate a
43:36 signal now someone made a really funny a
43:40 statement that I think is brilliant I
43:43 think it was on the Facebook page but
43:46 the brilliant thing is why sorry how is
43:50 it possible that 1969 through 72 NASA
43:54 was able to send live video from the
43:56 [ __ ] moon surface to earth no problem
43:59 right
44:00 but now it's 2018 and we can't get
44:05 cellular signals sometimes we can't get
44:08 GPS signals sometimes which is
44:10 ridiculous because they're supposed to
44:11 be satellites directly above always
44:13 beaming down their code and your phone
44:15 is simply triangulating between
44:16 different satellites you're never out of
44:18 reception from a geocentric GPS
44:21 satellite but then again maybe it's
44:23 ground transmission as it was prior to
44:26 the claim that they were geocentric grid
44:28 satellites up there you get to your
44:31 house my house you know there's dead
44:33 spots in my house for for wireless
44:36 technology how was this thing flawlessly
44:41 sending back signals
44:43 how the Voyager units out there sending
44:47 back signals after what 50 [ __ ] years
44:49 of being up there yeah right mm-hmm
44:52 you should start smelling the crap at
44:56 this point right we just yeah we just
45:01 hear complete and utter lunacy and we
45:05 believe it because we want to the funny
45:09 thing about debating any of the space
45:10 programs with someone who is you know
45:15 butthurt about this whole thing is that
45:18 they really turn into sort of an adult
45:20 raving child about the you know the fact
45:26 that we are telling them that their
45:29 heroic moment in life never happened
45:31 right so once all the assets are in the
45:35 cover stories have been written the true
45:39 CG animations that are going to be used
45:41 to show the re-entry right that that
45:44 completes the vision in their brain of
45:45 the people that want to believe this
45:47 stuff and again poor kids right imagine
45:50 the children of this world being sucked
45:52 into this stuff it's really sad they
45:55 have no hope of defending themselves
45:56 their parents are either you know
46:00 completely lost in the world or you know
46:02 they don't care and so no one's kind of
46:05 filtering it for the kids saying you
46:06 know what this is probably all [ __ ]
46:08 kid I'm really sorry but you know that's
46:11 why if you're interested in this you
46:12 should get into it because you can be
46:15 the first one to step on the moon you
46:17 could be the first one to leave Earth's
46:19 gravitational pull
46:20 how exciting is that man be the first if
46:26 no one had ever flown in a plane right
46:28 now a glider of any kind
46:31 there would be college student after
46:33 college student around the world trying
46:35 to fly and every single country just
46:38 like the Wright brothers did but no one
46:41 ever tries because it's already been
46:43 done so what happens on the day that the
46:47 rover is supposedly land it's a big
46:50 Hollywood production isn't it a bunch of
46:53 people sitting in a room staring at
46:55 monitor
46:55 there's no live feed but they stare at
46:58 monitors like there's some [ __ ] going on
47:00 right well it's you know a bunch of
47:02 feedback information about how the
47:04 rover's doing or how the satellites
47:06 doing right of this vehicle now
47:09 technically speaking is like eight or
47:10 nine minutes that data is delayed
47:12 getting to earth alright so they're
47:18 reporting on the past you know whether
47:19 or not happened or not is sort of it's
47:22 either totally destroyed already or it's
47:24 okay but what goes out the CG imprint of
47:28 what's happening the CG imprint of
47:30 what's happening Ivanka Trump posted
47:33 this [ __ ] CG thing on this last March
47:35 thing I mean she has to she's inside the
47:37 envelope of all this crap but that gets
47:39 into grandma's brain she thinks she's
47:41 seeing the real thing like there's some
47:43 camera crew you know shooting some unit
47:46 to shot of the thing landing right those
47:49 of you are hip to the moon missions
47:50 being faked it's just like Groundhog Day
47:53 over and over and over isn't it yeah a
47:56 lot of us are like how could the people
47:58 of the time of 1969 to 1972 swallow this
48:03 crap that we went to the moon plus you
48:06 know Paula wait Apollo 10 you know all
48:08 these other things right how do they
48:10 swallow then well look at your news
48:14 about Mars watch the people around you
48:16 swallow Mars mission stuff that's
48:19 exactly how they buy it it's exactly
48:22 what we're doing today yeah I do want to
48:25 suggest something here again I quoted it
48:28 wrong in the first few seconds of
48:30 episode three 11 it's not Buzz Aldrin
48:33 was murdered Gus Grissom was murdered so
48:37 people have been murdered for
48:39 understanding that the moon missions
48:41 were faked back in the 60s it is my dear
48:44 hope that those who understand that the
48:47 Mars missions are faked are not being
48:49 bumped off but if they were to run their
48:51 mouth there's some internal GPL dispute
48:55 or just some defect your employees like
48:57 I got your asses I'm gonna expose you've
48:59 got all your emails I'm gonna send it to
49:01 WikiLeaks or whatever they be murdered
49:04 they would be murdered before they left
49:06 with a lot
49:08 for those of you haven't been to JPL in
49:11 Pasadena it is a heavily heavily guarded
49:16 compound you again I have been inside of
49:20 it myself but I accidentally drove up to
49:22 the gate once because I have good friend
49:24 lives in Pasadena and I was leaving his
49:27 house and I made a wrong turn it was
49:29 like looking at these guards looking at
49:32 me like I don't see any sticker on your
49:34 car you better get out of here right and
49:37 so I was like at that point now of
49:39 course a strategic company like that is
49:42 going to have a gate and be protected
49:46 movie studios that [ __ ] gates video
49:48 game companies have gates half the time
49:50 so it's not completely out of the norm
49:52 but it gives you the true when you see
49:55 it I should say in Pasadena it will give
49:57 you the true impression of how how much
50:01 could be done behind those gates right
50:04 what's the whole thing about Willy Wonka
50:07 nobody ever goes in and no one ever
50:10 comes out he's in there creating things
50:14 secret things fun things well if you're
50:20 gonna conduct a bunch of trickery
50:21 wouldn't that be the case you don't go
50:25 to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles and
50:27 Hollywood and get to walk behind the
50:31 sets and see all the secrets and stuff
50:33 no you come in through the front door
50:36 you gotta be dressed in a suit you say
50:38 the open says me to the AL face the door
50:41 opens up you get to go in the secret
50:44 passageway from the lobby and then you
50:46 get an order dinner or watch a bunch of
50:48 different magic shows get shit-faced at
50:51 the speakeasy bar it's secret
50:55 but that's entertainment at the Magic
50:57 Castle and so does GPL now get in 1998
51:02 we have two we have two failed missions
51:04 which are very important to understand
51:06 in 1998 they had a probe crashed to the
51:12 surface of Mars supposedly I've
51:14 mentioned this several times were on the
51:15 episodes let's go through it again they
51:18 said that one of the modules that came
51:21 in
51:21 one of the countries was in standard the
51:24 American one the european modular came
51:26 in using metric and that when the
51:29 modules were talking to each other they
51:30 miscalculated the distance to the
51:32 surface of mars and crashed into the
51:35 surface now for those of you who do not
51:38 have technical jobs you might just go
51:41 well yeah that makes sense and I
51:43 understand I understand well that seems
51:45 like a plausible story but here's what
51:47 you need to understand there are factory
51:51 floors that have ISO certifications
51:56 usually starts at 9000 and goes up I
51:59 have worked on those factory floors
52:02 developing solutions for the engineers
52:05 on those floors so I got a chance to be
52:07 extremely acquainted with the rigorous
52:12 certification process of everything that
52:15 goes on in an ISO 9000 or above factory
52:18 floor the one thing that would never
52:21 occur especially in NASA where they run
52:23 complete tests thousands of times Breyer
52:26 to actually launching anything because
52:28 billions of dollars are at stake
52:30 and again in in reality the agencies at
52:34 stake if they make a huge mistake then
52:36 they lose credibility with the people on
52:38 dust there's 60 million dollars a day
52:40 you know spoiled [ __ ] brat allowance
52:42 right there will never be a situation
52:47 and a true ISO level factory where
52:53 that's going to occur those two modules
52:55 were tested together the software is
52:59 tested independently of the hardware
53:02 right yeah supercomputer here
53:04 supercomputer they're running European
53:06 OS running United States so us they're
53:09 gonna find this conversion problem so
53:11 quickly it's not going to be a problem
53:15 and oh let me let me um get you really
53:18 hip to something folks NASA is a metric
53:22 organization all space agencies are
53:25 metric it's [ __ ] annoying when you're
53:27 an American to walk in and go well how
53:30 how big is this rocket as 50 meters
53:33 really
53:34 meters the worst goddamn measurement on
53:37 plaintiff [ __ ] earth right it's a
53:38 super arbitrary stick was the sitting in
53:41 Paris or some [ __ ] maybe it's Geneva
53:42 now or whatever it's not quite three
53:44 feet it's little over three feeds and go
53:46 great it's way too big it's like Celsius
53:49 Celsius sucks right I'm sorry guys but
53:52 you have one degree to the next degree
53:55 is so huge that you don't have the
53:58 spectrum of what the human body is
53:59 capable of actually feeling you've
54:01 overshot your measurement system right I
54:04 can feel the difference between 70 and
54:06 72 I can feel it right it's a bit of a
54:10 chill at 70 it starts to become
54:12 tolerable at 72 the sun's on me right
54:14 now it's probably 73 74 with the Sun as
54:17 soon as that thing turns into a shadow
54:18 because the clouds bothering me it's
54:21 about 69 degrees at least it gets chilly
54:24 wanna metric you're just blowing way
54:27 beyond these measurements right so it's
54:30 a shitty system for the human body
54:31 Celsius metric while the brain has a
54:35 hard time thinking in meters it does
54:38 it's too much distance for the brain to
54:41 think about centimeters not too bad
54:43 standard was based on the biology of the
54:46 human body that's why we came up with
54:49 this over a thousands of thousands of
54:51 years so NASA is not a standard
54:54 organization it's all metric so why did
54:57 this thing crash because I'm telling you
54:59 it's impossible for these two modules to
55:01 be out of communication with each other
55:03 and it is trust me I had a girlfriend
55:08 once that just before I met her she had
55:10 worked on the Tomahawk missile system
55:12 for nine years nine years of testing a
55:15 Tomahawk missile system before they ever
55:16 fired one right they didn't have
55:20 conversion problems because they'd
55:22 already solved it in software I'm gonna
55:24 tell you right now it's my educated
55:26 guess but I would bet money on it
55:31 they couldn't get the CG pictures in the
55:35 ones that you saw in 2001 I believe it's
55:37 the Odyssey Rover they weren't ready
55:41 they needed another three years to
55:43 perfect the images so they launched this
55:45 rocket because they're going to have to
55:46 keep it on schedule and hey they can
55:48 continue working on the imagery and
55:50 trying to get it right while the vehicle
55:52 is headed towards Mars and the imaginary
55:56 world that is NASA that thing is spun
56:00 off fall into the ocean deployed a
56:02 [ __ ] whatever death-ray up there but
56:06 they couldn't get the images in they
56:08 couldn't get unbelievable and so they
56:12 wait till the eleventh hour
56:15 it's supposed to be landing and they
56:17 just go like Larry Silverstein said
56:21 let's pull it we decided to pull it ran
56:25 the story that it crashed then they
56:28 blame the fact you know here comes a
56:30 bunch of knee-jerk responses no laws
56:32 because I read and seeing in that we had
56:36 cut the budget so bad to NASA that we
56:38 made a piece of [ __ ] basically all right
56:41 well you can cut the budget all you want
56:43 you're still not gonna get standard
56:44 metric problems okay but whatever that
56:47 problem was it was heavily solved by
56:49 2001 we don't have any problems like
56:52 that anymore because we're so ahead of
56:54 the curve what's kind of interesting is
56:58 that musta had a catastrophic problem
57:00 with those images because we now know
57:03 the society will basically buy buy a
57:06 crayon drawing of Mars you see that man
57:10 I've told you Mars was and crayons so
57:15 Elon Musk also came out the last quarter
57:17 of 2018 and said he will most likely die
57:20 on Mars okay if he goes to space he's
57:27 gonna most likely die at about 500 miles
57:30 up I think it's interesting that I do I
57:34 do not believe that Elon Musk has been
57:39 to the International Space Station so
57:42 the idea that he's gonna hop in one of
57:44 his rockets and go to Mars is actually
57:46 fairly interesting I'm sure at this
57:48 point he wishes he was on Mars and just
57:51 you know to put a point on his
57:55 life I feel very sorry for the guy on
57:58 one level because I I do not believe he
58:03 probably started his career with the
58:05 intent to deceive and I think that the
58:07 for whatever chain of events that occurs
58:11 where you become one of these fake
58:14 Zuckerberg people right
58:16 they say you're a coder but you're not
58:18 you know all these other fake legends
58:21 about you again I have this book in my
58:24 house called guerilla marketing and it's
58:26 all about building up a fake persona
58:28 around the leader of a company to create
58:32 brand loyalty that essentially is more
58:36 powerful than the company itself and
58:38 that's what's happening with Tim Cook
58:39 and all of his personal social problems
58:42 that he keeps bringing into Apple's
58:44 brand right I don't think about Apple
58:47 anymore being Apple Apple is now Tim
58:50 Cook's complete [ __ ] personal
58:52 psychoses that he's developed over the
58:54 years he's trying to resolve them using
58:58 the public eye he's like it's not kind
59:00 of saying I fear that I am messed up so
59:03 look at me I'm the CEO of this company
59:06 because I am I'm gonna use Apple's power
59:09 to destroy your vision of me which is
59:12 all in my head now what has in the Olfa
59:15 any ill-feeling services person but in
59:17 his head he's got this thing he's got a
59:19 defeat and so he's using his company to
59:21 push it out and the board of directors
59:23 again I think apples being prepped to be
59:26 sold he might seem that a lot faster
59:29 than you think at this point so Elon
59:32 Musk is now sort of a he's a puppet at
59:37 this point and I think he knows it and
59:39 the thing about it is when I see his
59:41 body language when he's in interviews
59:44 where he's not you know doing some fluff
59:46 interview like the more like the one
59:48 with Joe Rogan you can kind of see the
59:51 real human being inside there who's just
59:53 kind of going you know what I'm not a
59:54 [ __ ] and I'm only gonna put up with
59:57 this [ __ ] for a certain amount of time
59:59 before I'm just gonna blow the whistle
60:00 or whatever it is right I mean they
60:02 probably Howard he use them faster and
60:05 he could you know imagine but
60:08 I'm not convinced everyone's evil who is
60:12 being forced to participate in these
60:13 situations man has never been to the
60:16 moon and therefore man has never been to
60:19 Mars and man going to Mars as a first
60:23 step and reintroducing man into space
60:27 quote-unquote is hogwash
60:31 right there's this new initiative now to
60:33 get to the moon again with man oh my god
60:38 you know this I swear to God I hope
60:43 someone pulls out the anti-gravity
60:44 system with a new propulsion system so
60:47 we can actually have a momentary moment
60:53 of pride for me and kind that maybe they
60:57 actually pulled it off it's very
60:59 interesting when you look at some of the
61:01 first illustrations of Mars way back in
61:06 the day like the Galileo type up days
61:09 you have illustrations that don't mirror
61:13 anything that NASA's pulled back
61:15 when we started getting telescopes at
61:18 the turn of the century turn of the 20th
61:20 century our pictures of Mars are
61:23 completely different than what we see
61:24 today like impossible color schemes are
61:27 in shots that we see today and of course
61:31 they're harder and harder to find
61:33 unfortunately luckily they're it's the
61:36 books and libraries so for those of you
61:38 dig libraries get into like some really
61:41 eclectic old-ass library in your
61:43 hometown or your town wherever you live
61:45 and try to find old photographs of Mars
61:48 to take your cell phone and pop pictures
61:50 of these things and post them up there
61:52 for us so we can kind of build our own
61:53 little library of logic you know what's
62:01 really interesting is we have more
62:02 claims from NASA that they have pictures
62:05 of Mars from space than they have of
62:08 Earth from space right so what should a
62:12 mission to Mars really look like if
62:14 we're going to give them the test back
62:15 the other way to say okay NASA JPL you
62:18 want to claim you're going to Mars
62:19 well here's your set of requirements
62:21 and again they'll have that meeting
62:24 again and they're gonna bring in their
62:25 software engineers this time ago can you
62:27 do it can you fake this and they're
62:30 gonna go no [ __ ] way
62:32 no I can we do this we can give you
62:34 something it's kind of okay and a 40% of
62:37 the world's gonna believe it
62:39 30% will be skeptical but the other 30%
62:42 will call you out in a heartbeat and
62:46 that would be first you design a rocket
62:51 that has the propulsion system that we
62:54 can put in an engineering package and we
62:57 can run it in the engineering package
62:59 and it's going to solve for escaping
63:01 Earth's you know gravitational force
63:05 going into orbit then you're going to
63:08 have to explain something that they've
63:10 never explained which is what extra
63:13 thrust are you putting behind the rocket
63:16 to get it in some elliptical slingshot
63:20 orbit right you guys show us that on
63:25 paper you have to be able to run it
63:26 inside engineering software that not you
63:29 didn't program the software Autodesk
63:32 program the software unity3d unreal
63:36 perfect physics engines are gonna have
63:38 to be able to pull this off all of them
63:40 without special modifications without
63:43 special plugins that have your NASA math
63:45 in it right your [ __ ] algorithms
63:47 right we want a camera on the entire
63:50 mission
63:51 you understand cache it send it whatever
63:55 you got to do you can't launch until you
63:58 can provide full live feed
64:00 there's no cutoff point for live feed
64:04 the whole time
64:05 as long as it's an earth Earth visual
64:10 spectrum you want to be able to see it
64:11 from the ground too but we want to see
64:14 this thing shot happen we want to see
64:15 earth get far away get close get far
64:18 away get close get far away get close
64:19 and eventually boof you've introduced
64:22 this huge surge of energy into this
64:25 slingshot theory that makes it break
64:28 from orbit of Earth something that has
64:31 never occurred right
64:34 so now it's heading into deep black
64:36 space again according to NASA [ __ ] man
64:40 you can't even see the Milky Way so
64:43 let's let's be consistent here those
64:46 pictures better not have any stars in
64:47 them better have no Milky Way in it
64:50 unless you want to explain why the rest
64:52 your shots don't we want to see video of
64:55 the Moon and Earth getting smaller and
64:59 getting smaller yes you're gonna have to
65:02 put extra cameras on the vehicle to
65:03 capture those shots
65:05 to be slightly impractical for the
65:07 mission they're very practical for
65:09 proving your outrageous claim that you
65:11 caught a fish this big and no one was
65:14 there to witness it so the next shot we
65:18 want to see is the fluence shot of
65:22 approaching Mars from really far away
65:25 again if you're off ten thousandth of a
65:28 degree you're not going to hit Mars
65:30 because in the millions of miles of
65:32 millions of miles you have to go you're
65:35 gonna miss it
65:37 then you have to explain the guidance
65:40 system in space that is seeing Mars and
65:45 making adjustments and making
65:46 adjustments and making adjustments
65:48 Rawls's where is all this fuel coming
65:50 from right do you realize if there was a
65:52 coronal mass ejection in the entire six
65:54 months traveling it might take to get to
65:57 Mars you're talking about a big thrust
65:59 II push against the vehicle in the very
66:01 fabric of space itself how are you going
66:05 to compensate for that you can't predict
66:08 when coronal mass ejections are gonna
66:09 happen I mean there's a cyclical nature
66:12 to them but it's gonna happen but we
66:16 need to see that red dot get bigger and
66:18 bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
66:19 and we want to see you catch up to a
66:21 body in space that is traveling way
66:25 faster than our body in space how do you
66:28 catch up to a car that's going faster
66:31 than you when you've already had all of
66:33 your propulsion system spent you're not
66:35 going to get any extra gas right it's
66:38 like coasting downhill in your car in
66:41 neutral well the car next to you is
66:43 going by at a hundred miles an hour and
66:45 nASA has a special technique
66:48 that just coasting you're gonna beat
66:50 that car going 100 miles an hour we need
66:52 to see you go into orbit on camera we
66:56 need to really see the stars in space as
66:58 well because we want to triangulate
66:59 where you say this planet is at any one
67:02 particular time based on the angle that
67:04 this rocket is looking at Mars we should
67:07 be able to see all the stars come around
67:10 rotate as we go around it's all there
67:13 but now if you're subtracting the stars
67:15 you're getting rid of a lot of accuracy
67:18 that we would then otherwise use to
67:21 prove that you're doing it right or
67:22 wrong or faking it right we want to see
67:25 the landing remember that probe that's
67:28 supposed to land on what is it Saturn's
67:29 moon Titan it's got the spinny
67:32 photograph that goes down and goes down
67:34 and goes down and then poof it lands
67:35 right kidding me and Nessa can't make
67:38 any mistakes as long as they're not on
67:40 [ __ ] planet Earth and everything
67:43 better match everything else that you've
67:44 sent us right all the other
67:46 reconnaissance photographs of the
67:48 surface of Mars better match pixel for
67:52 pixel and what are the odds that every
67:56 time we land the weather's just perfect
68:01 on Mars Wow we can't predict when it's
68:04 gonna rain in California what if the
68:07 thing landed in the middle of a horrible
68:08 storm now I mentioned the 2003 Beagle
68:14 landing and this I believe was attached
68:16 to the Titan no no sorry it was attached
68:18 to the unit that went to Jupiter's
68:20 surface or you know went through the
68:22 clouds and you know they said they're
68:23 gonna rewrite the book about Jupiter and
68:25 then we never heard another peep out of
68:26 them hilarious but the Beagle was
68:30 developed by a gentleman in the UK I
68:32 forget his name but he I think he worked
68:35 like 30 years on this thing he devoted
68:37 his life to creating this little saucer
68:39 shaped satellite which was to pull off
68:44 and do like we know a little parachute
68:46 maneuver and land it he was buying a
68:49 ticket on this vehicle that was going to
68:52 Jupiter so as it went by and went boof
68:54 there you go buddy and of course it
68:57 crashed and disappeared
69:00 and I think about it if his unit
69:03 actually were on Mars and it operated
69:06 properly then he would have his own data
69:10 about Mars now we'll say compared to the
69:13 Hollywood systems that we see coming out
69:16 of SpaceX today and the previous ones
69:18 that came out of NASA JPL the Beagle
69:21 looked fairly meek and design looked
69:25 fairly flimsy in design I don't know if
69:30 that thing is actually that bad off at
69:33 all because I don't think anyone's ever
69:35 really tried I shouldn't say tried
69:38 really actually ended on Mars maybe his
69:40 designs are fantastic right don't know
69:43 but they don't have the apparatus to lie
69:46 under the beagle team Britain's not
69:51 gonna spend that much money on some
69:53 underwater Isis simulator and all this
69:55 other stuff they're just not going to do
69:57 it so of course they had to destroy a
70:01 satellite sad part is it probably never
70:05 never left Earth okay
70:07 now there's some debate about the
70:10 nosecone loading of these Rockets you
70:15 know you have a nose cone and you put
70:17 something in the nose cone which is the
70:19 payload and does that really occur my
70:25 buddy Kyle has been to one of the NASA
70:27 facilities I believe in Florida where
70:30 they took him through and they showed in
70:31 the cleanroom and there was just
70:33 satellite after satellite after
70:34 satellite you know wrapped up and ready
70:36 to go so he said they're making those
70:39 those units and I believe they are what
70:43 he was looking at were satellites all
70:45 right so that's a low orbit object again
70:51 supposedly we have geocentric orbit
70:54 satellites as well a lot of debate
70:57 whether NASA satellites exist for some
70:59 of you guys again I've seen some pretty
71:01 convincing schematics myself they are
71:04 making these objects in warehouses and
71:07 they work diligently for thousands if
71:10 not millions of hours and combined work
71:12 workforce right
71:14 so someone's making these things so now
71:17 there's the big question and I get it I
71:19 got it
71:21 I kept about a month ago I can trigger
71:24 the hell I was talking to but they were
71:27 saying that you know one of the
71:28 questions that haunts anyone over 55 is
71:31 the amount of people that would have to
71:33 collaborate to keep a conspiracy of this
71:35 magnitude going and as I explained in
71:39 the how they did it episode of the moon
71:41 missions I think at least in the moon
71:43 missions they were able to keep the
71:44 people on the inside extremely tight
71:48 alright people ask me how many people
71:50 they think would have to do it I don't
71:52 know I would say if there's 10,000
71:54 people in the fraud I would say less
71:58 than less than 200 I think would have to
72:01 be in on the forged footage I think
72:05 actually you could get you could get
72:06 away with 75 100 people to be honest and
72:10 you would start with employees that are
72:12 already kind st employees they already
72:15 operate in secret they value themselves
72:18 based on the coveted secrecy that they
72:21 actually are a part of right why do so
72:25 many people lie about having been in the
72:27 CIA it's like one of these big things or
72:29 they they lie about their valor they say
72:32 that their Navy SEALs when they've never
72:34 been through Navy SEAL training much of
72:37 those folks right I saw another one the
72:40 other day
72:40 this poor guy showed up to some event
72:43 and he had just glued all this [ __ ] to
72:45 himself he wore his designation twice
72:50 you know you were like the formal
72:52 designation for his formal wear in his
72:54 field designation on his shoulders is
72:56 horrible right and he just had been to
72:59 too many battles that he wasn't alive
73:00 for he was just but these guys from the
73:03 military who are just really kind of
73:05 average Joe soldiers they're so trained
73:08 because it's just so ingrained and all
73:10 the policies of wearing these things and
73:12 how you wear them they just picked the
73:16 guy apart and he was trying to lie and
73:18 he did he did a bang-up job trying to
73:24 lie to these guys what was kind of
73:26 interesting was he wore so much
73:28 now so many accolades on his uniform
73:31 that in order to get to these levels of
73:34 seniority within the military your IQ is
73:37 fairly high
73:38 you're probably 120 plus and the guy
73:41 talking was probably 85 right so he's
73:45 horrible broken English and you're just
73:47 like oh I see
73:48 because the thing is is he's an innocent
73:51 kid trying to be something that he
73:54 admires right so there's actually this
73:57 weird silver lining of patriotism within
74:01 the people that are trying to do this
74:02 sometimes right now your guy who's
74:05 pretending to be a Navy SEAL he gets to
74:08 try it in tattooed on his arm and and
74:10 he's just trying to be a rough tough
74:12 [ __ ] in a bar [ __ ] those guys right
74:14 that's where they need to be called out
74:18 but there's a lot of good nerdy guys
74:21 that wish they'd enlisted or maybe the
74:23 enlisted a little time and they they for
74:25 whatever reason they just always wanted
74:27 to be in the military and so they're
74:28 dressing up as this person right but now
74:31 what if you could take that guy the last
74:34 one I saw and you could tell that dude
74:37 hey you uh you know we got you got this
74:41 photograph of you right here and you're
74:43 you're faking all this [ __ ] right you
74:45 never were in this and we know because
74:47 we're the government so we always
74:49 straight that you're you're lying about
74:51 your service and the guys embarrassed
74:53 turns purple and he's like yeah you know
74:57 and he's like well the next thing is
74:59 said to him is well we know that you're
75:01 a patriot right that's why you're doing
75:03 this absolutely I love my country and I
75:06 love the military and I wish I had been
75:08 all these things see okay well we like
75:10 where your heart is now how'd you like
75:14 to participate in something so [ __ ]
75:16 beyond this fake [ __ ] you put on your
75:19 chest how would you like to really be
75:21 involved with something clandestine
75:23 meaning secret right the guys like sign
75:28 me up
75:29 well here's the deal guy here's a piece
75:33 of paper and there's a signature block
75:35 at the bottom when you sign this piece
75:38 of paper you are swearing to God
75:40 Almighty
75:41 and every American commander-in-chief
75:43 from this point forward all your
75:45 commanding officers etc but you will
75:48 never ever reveal that you've been
75:49 involved with this super super deep
75:52 secret project and that guy is going to
75:55 mash his signature on that contract and
75:58 agree to a lifetime gag order and then
76:02 they're gonna tell them I go say look
76:03 you can't wear a badge about what you
76:06 just signed down for you understand that
76:08 right yes but now let me tell you when
76:12 you're walking down the street there you
76:15 go to one of these patriotic veterans
76:18 gatherings or whatever you're gonna know
76:21 deep down inside your soul that you are
76:24 actually a part of one of the most
76:27 important projects of all of the mankind
76:33 the head just goes boom right [ __ ] yeah
76:37 man so there are a lot of people out
76:39 there like this a lot of people out
76:42 there like this and so that's how they
76:48 find good hearted people who mean well
76:52 and again we don't know all the agendas
76:55 behind why they do what they do right
76:57 maybe there is some really decent
76:59 rationale with decent metrics decent
77:01 data that's coming in that goes you know
77:03 what faking it has so many benefits over
77:07 the negative things that even you would
77:14 agree it's hard to believe but let's go
77:18 with it and then you might sit across
77:19 the table and cynically go yeah what
77:21 about Gus Grissom and his two buddies
77:23 what about those guys what about
77:25 everyone that was [ __ ] murdered who
77:26 saw JFK get assassinated what about all
77:29 those people and they simply look at you
77:31 and they go look JFK thing may have
77:34 anything to do with that that was a
77:35 bunch of [ __ ] at a level that again
77:39 we don't anything to do with that Gus
77:42 well the people that made the decision
77:44 to take him out are long gone we would
77:48 never do that today but now here's the
77:49 difference between Gus Grissom's
77:51 yesterday and folks that we bring on
77:54 board today
77:56 Gus was brought in as an authentic
78:00 person and pushed in as the very first
78:03 astronaut it was going to fly on the
78:05 Apollo 1 and we don't do it like that
78:10 anymore there are no chances all these
78:15 fake astronauts you see going to the ISS
78:17 supposedly or any space shuttle mission
78:20 or whatever they are pre censored like
78:24 that dude we just signed had signed that
78:26 piece of paper over there they're
78:27 Patriots a one-level
78:30 now I think we've got some astronauts
78:32 that are pretty shitty folks at this
78:37 point I think of some great folks
78:38 probably majority of them are great but
78:40 we had you know one girl lured one of
78:44 the astronauts girlfriend to a bar and I
78:46 think she [ __ ] killed her right
78:48 because she was a jealous person she was
78:51 so jealous that she either killed her or
78:54 attempted to kill her she got
78:56 court-martialed and all kinds of other
78:57 [ __ ] but she timed it such that her
79:00 husband or her start her boyfriend was
79:01 off on a mission doing a space shuttle
79:03 mission and she again called her to a
79:07 bar and roughed her up or killed her I
79:10 can't remember exactly how it went but
79:12 that's an astronaut killing somebody
79:14 right so you got some bad apples
79:17 considering how few apples there are in
79:19 that camp it's hard to imagine they
79:21 accidentally fell onto someone so
79:23 socially insecure or mentally insecure
79:26 in her own world that she pulled that
79:29 stunt obviously one of the things that
79:31 infuriates those of us who monitor this
79:34 kind of stuff is our excuse me are the
79:37 interviews that we see with these folks
79:40 supposedly in the ISS right they're up
79:43 there singing David Bowie songs and you
79:47 know you're like where are the
79:48 experiments where is our money going
79:50 because even at face value if we think
79:53 that you're there the mission that mean
79:56 that this experiments that you'll see
79:58 last the last two are I saw through the
80:00 space station by an astronaut was a male
80:03 he was showing some of the experiments
80:07 in the corners of the space day
80:09 and honestly it was the most laughable
80:11 crap you've ever heard of it's not a
80:14 laboratory up there it's like a sardine
80:17 can with [ __ ] absolutely everywhere it's
80:20 the most filthy [ __ ] place you've
80:22 ever seen right
80:24 it just got wires everywhere you know
80:27 and it's like again so we were debating
80:29 this on the Facebook page not really
80:31 debating but all agreeing on the lunacy
80:33 of the fact that you know none of the
80:36 women have their hair and hair nets you
80:39 know there's no uniform the people where
80:42 there's no you know there's no
80:45 provisions anywhere that I can tell for
80:47 someone getting sick
80:49 what if someone got nauseous they got
80:52 some bad food it just didn't realize
80:54 that it expired or they realized they
80:56 didn't realize they were allergic to
80:57 some ingredient in the food I'm sure
80:58 they check a lot of that stuff but you
81:00 know people get sick every once in a
81:02 while and they throw up what the hell
81:04 are you gonna do is someone barfing in
81:06 one of those zero-gravity rooms a lot of
81:10 people barf when they see other people
81:11 barf and so it's it's a dangerous
81:15 situation there's no provisions are out
81:17 there just wearing their chuck-e-cheese
81:19 clothing and you know having no problem
81:21 bouncing around I have long hair most of
81:23 you women do too and you know the [ __ ]
81:25 gets absolutely everywhere well a hair
81:28 falling on a circuit could create a
81:30 short carrying electricity of point A to
81:32 point B or it shouldn't be doing that
81:34 but if nothing else the crap gets
81:36 everywhere right I'm sweeping my house
81:39 constantly to get my hair off [ __ ] right
81:42 so in terms of the Mars missions I think
81:44 there's a lot more people involved with
81:46 the hoax than perhaps ever was involved
81:49 with the moon mission maybe I'm wrong
81:51 but I think I'm right I do think it's a
81:54 mix of some live action shots and it's
81:58 the 3d rendering shots if I were they
82:00 might get out of the live-action world
82:02 as quickly as possible maybe they're
82:06 completely out by now but again there's
82:11 an esop fable about a boy who called
82:12 wolf and the village ran out to find the
82:16 wolf and it wasn't there but he got all
82:18 the attention didn't he because that's
82:20 what that little boy needed was the
82:21 attention
82:22 after three times of doing that to the
82:26 village he could no longer could gain
82:28 the trust of the village to come out and
82:32 eventually the wolf showed up and eat
82:34 him I think that's the way it ends it
82:38 was a Grimm brothers tale it's
82:39 definitely a way we went in so we're at
82:41 the point now where all the space
82:43 agencies have called wolf so many times
82:45 and produced such flimsy evidence of
82:47 their claim again outrageous claims
82:51 require outrageous evidence that were
82:54 cynical now we're sort of done with
82:56 those agencies aren't we I don't think
83:00 anyone wants to be done with this
83:01 program and so I think a lot of us kind
83:05 of on the side go well it's not like I
83:08 don't want us to explore space but we
83:13 just want to get real with the true
83:15 obstacles that our interface with like
83:17 the Orion project trying to figure out
83:19 whether or not they could ever build a
83:20 vehicle that could push human flesh
83:22 through the Van Allen belts that's the
83:23 point of the project again they've done
83:27 it countless times but all of a sudden
83:30 it's a it's a barrier that we have to
83:32 have a program to greenlight which then
83:33 was obviously ceremoniously cancelled
83:35 after its first trip for those of you
83:38 knew the program bart sibrel went up to
83:42 nasa said could I have the data that you
83:43 got from the first mission on the Orion
83:45 project because I'd like to see how how
83:47 radioactive the belts are the Van Allen
83:49 belts right and they said yeah that
83:51 information is classified sorry it's
83:55 it's a bit like saying I got a door to
83:57 my house behind this camera then there's
83:59 about a 15 foot patio and then there's
84:01 some green grass and a fence okay and
84:05 I'm telling you that I've been to that
84:06 fence 20 times but you've never seen it
84:12 with your own eyes but then later on I
84:15 developed this theory that the patio is
84:17 so volatile you can't actually get
84:19 across it you're like worried you've
84:23 already said you've been across the
84:24 patio oh I totally did it totally didn't
84:26 matter then 50 years agos by anti green
84:31 light a project it's like 40 47 years or
84:34 whatever it was
84:35 a green LED a project to explore the
84:38 patio to make sure I can get to the
84:39 fence and you're looking at me going
84:41 wait a minute dude you said you've
84:43 already been across the page
84:44 well you know what I did was I went
84:46 through this wormhole to get over there
84:47 and that wormhole is gone so now we're
84:49 gonna figure out a walk over there and
84:51 yeah sure dude whatever one of the
84:54 things I want to point out is that I
84:56 could probably do an entire episode on
84:58 it but our trust and these organizations
85:04 is at an all-time low I have never seen
85:08 more posts about us faking the moon
85:11 missions than right now in 2018 and when
85:15 I say posts obviously I'm making
85:18 episodes about and I'm drawing in the
85:19 choir so obviously we're gonna get a lot
85:21 of those complementary comments or yeah
85:24 complimentary in shape congruent
85:28 comments if you will but what I'm
85:30 talking about is I'll go up to a website
85:33 like a Fox News or CNN or BBC or
85:37 whatever where they're reporting on the
85:38 moon mission thing or NASA progress or
85:41 ISS progress or whatever and you scroll
85:43 down where they allow comments from the
85:45 public and I'm telling you right now it
85:48 is I I think without exaggeration it's
85:54 easily 80% I think it might be as high
85:56 as 90% or even a little bit over 90% of
85:59 the comments are people from around the
86:00 world going this is all [ __ ] NASA is
86:05 lying and the Europeans are like the
86:08 Americans are lying so let me ask you
86:12 one of the big comments about why NASA
86:15 has to hang on to the lie is to hang on
86:18 to the the patriotic accomplishment
86:21 slash claim that we went to the moon
86:24 like that's something we have to hang on
86:26 to because if we reveal that we didn't
86:29 even though everybody involved is dead
86:32 pretty much right I mean if some
86:34 astronauts are still alive right that if
86:37 we reveal it we take a bunch of egg on
86:39 our face we look like a lying
86:41 organization bla bla bla Americans bad
86:43 whatever I think right now
86:48 we are starting a phase and we were well
86:51 within the phase of people thinking that
86:54 anyway and we are starting to look we
87:01 are starting to look really bad day
87:03 after day after day again we have ISS
87:07 footage of them on wires right guide as
87:11 a Ford flip supposedly in zero gravity
87:13 and the dude next to him grabs the wire
87:16 at his waist we have a dude sailing in a
87:19 tea joint behind two guys in an
87:21 interview at the ISS on a harness going
87:24 by they forgot to CG out the harness we
87:28 have George Bush Senior being pushed
87:30 through the Houston Space Center there
87:35 on the screen as a augmented reality
87:37 blue screen grid which helps augmented
87:40 reality software figure out scale in
87:42 relation to objects that they're
87:44 supposedly rotoscoping out automatically
87:47 with software to make it look like the
87:49 guys doing some CG thing in space so the
87:51 guys just moving his hand like this the
87:54 ball of CG the ball knows its depth
87:56 based on the grid that's behind the guy
87:59 because we know how big the dude is I
88:00 mean it's they've been caught red-handed
88:05 faking is s internal footage
88:08 I can't you never see any stars in space
88:10 you never see the Milky Way you never
88:13 see the moon from the ISS like a really
88:16 great shot just hey you know here's the
88:18 camera boom there's the moon there's
88:20 earth there's the Milky Way I'm gonna
88:22 adjust the camera here again big giant
88:27 fancy cameras like hostile Bloods need
88:30 to have their apertures changed
88:32 okay the amount of light going in the
88:33 lens to basically keep a proper exposure
88:36 of what you're taking a picture of the
88:37 old-school [ __ ] right but a cell phone
88:41 does what a cell phone takes a shot 98
88:46 to 99 percent or whatever the human eye
88:48 can see you can see it in your cell
88:49 phone how many times if you pointed your
88:51 cell phone at a party and like 50 people
88:54 are missing because it's like an
88:55 aperture [ __ ] story never right I
89:00 can take my camera on
89:02 night my cell phone camera on my Android
89:05 note 8 and push it right at the stars
89:07 and I'll get stars I can even bring it
89:10 down so I get some you know earth bound
89:13 buildings and the stars right if I can
89:17 see it with my eye my camera can see it
89:19 so there's excuses they're gonna have to
89:23 be more electrical universe excuses
89:26 which again NASA has never got on board
89:28 with electrical universe electrical
89:30 universe theory says you can't see stars
89:31 with that atmosphere but like I said if
89:34 an astronaut is inside an oxygenated
89:36 oxygenated cabin there's your atmosphere
89:39 here comes the wiggle verb of a photon
89:43 and it's going to vibrate the air and
89:47 it's going to vibrate the liquid in your
89:49 eyeball is any of the rods and cones in
89:51 your eye it's gonna go right around the
89:53 back of your brain upside down backwards
89:54 projection there it is you don't have
89:58 astronauts up there saying oh I can see
90:00 the Milky Way but you can't see it this
90:02 is [ __ ] weird they never say that I
90:05 never even mentioned the fact that part
90:07 of their hoax is they can't simulate
90:09 stars because why they're two
90:12 mathematically precise to fake on a live
90:15 stage with blue screen how many of you
90:20 have seen blue screen that actually you
90:27 know some some foreground object person
90:29 or whatever's in front of the blue
90:32 screen and the camera pans in the room
90:36 but the stars well not the stars
90:39 necessary but whatever's in the
90:40 background doesn't pan and you sit there
90:43 and you go whoa oh it's a blue screen I
90:45 get it because they can't they haven't
90:48 written the software to match the track
90:49 you know they have the software today
90:51 but to track the camera and the fakeness
90:55 of the background and because the
90:57 background should be in some sort of 3d
90:59 again stars are not going to have 3d
91:00 anything because they're so far out
91:02 there technically but if you were to do
91:05 that to a bunch of foreground or a bunch
91:07 of background objects like the camera
91:09 and the computer in front of me I want
91:10 to film myself in front of a blue screen
91:13 we're gonna fake everything that's on
91:15 this side
91:16 that has the parallax right my camera
91:18 starting my camera computer is pretty
91:20 close
91:21 well that table out there is a little
91:23 further away and the bushes are even
91:24 further away so the further the way it
91:27 is it's gonna parallax lower right but
91:31 what's gonna happen is that the Milky
91:34 Way is gonna be a big stripe out there
91:36 and it's going to move like a fixture in
91:39 the background perfectly so if they're
91:42 paying this camera at that thing is
91:44 gonna sit there like wallpaper on the
91:45 wall and as you move around it's just
91:47 like moving it around and wallpaper in
91:49 your house I don't think they have the
91:52 tech yet or if they maybe sorry maybe
91:54 they have the tech now but because they
91:56 blew all the shots before they're not
91:58 willing to introduce it and they're not
92:00 willing to say oh we have a new CCD
92:03 sensor inside of our cameras that now
92:05 gets it and now you can see the stars
92:09 going on a little bit beyond the Mars
92:13 theme in this episode because I need you
92:15 to understand the compounded lunacy of
92:19 all of these issues they're not being
92:23 addressed because I don't think they can
92:25 be addressed because the previous
92:27 violations in reality and because of
92:30 perhaps some technical limitations that
92:32 still remain I do not believe we have
92:35 Rovers on Mars I don't do I want to
92:39 believe we have Rose Rovers on Mars yeah
92:41 I mean I guess I do I like to see one of
92:44 these guys land on the moon first I mean
92:46 how stupid is any logistical scientific
92:52 person in NASA gpo or any other space
92:56 associated space organization to not
92:59 test the Mars platform on the moon first
93:01 that's what you would do right you know
93:06 if you and I sat in this backyard and
93:09 built our own little dune buggy our own
93:12 vehicle of some sort it ran on orange
93:15 juice or whatever the hell all right I
93:18 ran on hope power or whatever and the
93:23 initial start of the the the eventual
93:25 goal we want to do is drive to New York
93:27 City
93:29 about a 3200 mile drive if you could
93:32 drive a straight line well don't you
93:34 think we'd take it to the drugstore
93:36 first don't you think we drive it around
93:39 the backyard first not NASA boy Ness is
93:44 just like [ __ ] man we never even turned
93:46 this thing on before but the first place
93:47 we're gonna [ __ ] go is Mars with a
93:50 brand new platform well is there a
93:54 couple bucks at stake I think there's a
93:56 lot of money at stake a lot of time
93:58 invested there's the social pride of our
94:00 country blah blah blah you'd want to get
94:03 it right the first time and why not run
94:05 a mission that can be monitored by
94:08 normal human beings why not offer up all
94:13 of these huge telescope arrays that are
94:15 sitting in the desert the was that the
94:17 Vatican funded project Lucifer or ray
94:20 and say okay we're gonna show
94:24 pedestrians how to run this thing and
94:27 we're gonna have a live feed straight up
94:30 there right where we say we're gonna lay
94:32 in this thing obviously CG can be
94:34 involved but again you open up and make
94:36 it more transparent you take one array
94:39 and say all this is going to be
94:41 disclosed to the public and then we're
94:44 gonna watch the mission take place and
94:46 the camera is never going to turn off
94:48 because it's gonna buffer whatever they
94:50 say can't be fed live what we're gonna
94:52 see every single frame of going to this
94:55 moon mission this low-hanging fruit our
94:58 neighbor in space but they don't do it
95:02 because they're not doing it will we
95:05 ever have this expose in our lifetime
95:09 well the current administration which is
95:12 preaching a lot of power back to the
95:14 people has doubled down on the hoax
95:17 obviously they're either being
95:19 threatened or they have been sold a pile
95:21 of [ __ ] that they think is better than
95:23 telling the truth right again how do you
95:26 build a paradigm of existence out of
95:29 Lies and say that you're bettering those
95:34 lives I would argue you're nuts
95:39 and you will never receive the bounty of
95:42 true existence and the reward of life by
95:45 lying to people you just won't is the
95:49 truth that bad I don't think so I don't
95:54 think so
95:54 for those that are going to potentially
95:58 slash their wrists because we didn't go
95:59 to the moon okay for those very few
96:01 people we just don't have to tell them
96:04 right we'll send them extra extra CNN
96:08 feeds that we went we'll send them extra
96:11 coffee books that we went and just keep
96:13 them in there a little little sane
96:14 asylum so they can feel like they're
96:16 delusional matrixes reality but for the
96:19 rest of us we're potentially going to go
96:23 and amazingly we wouldn't be able to
96:25 show those other people in the asylum
96:27 our new stuff potentially because it
96:30 might look completely different than the
96:31 fake stuff we put together
96:33 it's anyway I think you feel me very
96:38 interested in your comments here I know
96:39 a lot of YouTube channels bate what do
96:41 you think about the moon missions or
96:43 Mars missions and Rovers on Mars and
96:45 they try to pay into a bunch of comments
96:47 I never try to do that
96:49 I don't bombard my channel at the
96:51 beginning with hey if there's a button
96:54 and make sure you hit the bell [ __ ] if I
96:57 never heard that again in my life it
96:58 couldn't be too soon but what you can do
97:01 is go to deep thoughts radio.com take
97:04 your pick without you want an audio
97:06 podcast or a video I have been a little
97:09 slow on publishing the audio versions I
97:12 do apologize we'll get the other two out
97:14 today which aren't up yet for those of
97:18 you who want to discuss things in a
97:20 forum Facebook is the best thing some of
97:23 you are posting your email addresses to
97:25 be contacted I have extremely limited
97:29 time to to get into correspondence
97:32 because we're always talking about
97:33 pretty deep stuff right so just know
97:35 there's at this point nearly 3200
97:38 subscribers at any one point in time
97:41 there's probably a dozen folks that want
97:43 to have 10 hours worth of email
97:45 conversations it's impossible for me to
97:48 to satiate all those requests I do wish
97:51 there was
97:52 I do wish this is all I ever did right
97:54 that'd be kind of cool right do a lot
97:56 more research get a lot more production
97:58 value in the episodes but sadly life
98:02 demands side you other things so for
98:05 those of you who are supporting me on
98:06 patreon I really appreciate it I've
98:08 gotten some new folks contributing there
98:11 for the folks that have hung on for a
98:13 really long time I can't thank you guys
98:16 enough again this episode comes out of a
98:18 patreon request there are other patreon
98:20 requests in there I need to do a little
98:22 bit more research on before I can get
98:24 the episode out the door so again the
98:26 patreon side of things just so that you
98:28 know there's virtually no posts
98:31 available to the outside public so if
98:33 you go to the patreon page and you're
98:34 like Anne [ __ ] there's nothing here I'm
98:35 not gonna contribute to this [ __ ]
98:37 just understand when you get behind the
98:39 door you will immediately see all the
98:42 early previews that I've posted for
98:45 folks to see the minimum amount of early
98:48 previews that I do today as of 2018-2019
98:50 is about 80% of the episodes go outs and
98:54 if you're paying attention you turn on
98:56 your Bell notification and patreon you
98:59 will get me sitting in my office
99:01 literally pushing the upload button on
99:05 YouTube get all this stuff in there then
99:08 I grab the URL and I posted on the
99:10 patreon page and say look and three
99:12 hours when this thing gets done
99:14 uploading and encoding you guys are
99:16 going to get it first you guys get a
99:17 pretty good heartbeat so instead of
99:20 double headers for patreon viewers
99:21 they're getting you know one dropped on
99:24 Wednesday and usually one dropped on a
99:26 Saturday but the other thing that's
99:28 going on there is a lot of it's starting
99:30 to starting to to beef up a little bit
99:32 more conversations with people saying
99:34 you know what about this what about that
99:37 once you do an episode on this and
99:38 they're just you know for someone to
99:40 give me a buck a month they're already
99:42 deep in the product they understand
99:44 what's been recorded before and so their
99:47 suggestions are usually just dead-on
99:50 I do love of a the folks out there on
99:54 YouTube that say you should you know do
99:57 an episode on a particular subject and
99:59 I've already done the episode with the
100:01 exact same title and so then all hotlink
100:04 you know in the comments say I've
100:05 already got this one
100:06 and people like oh my god it didn't no
100:07 don't worry there's three hundred and
100:09 fifty episodes roughly with the special
100:11 reports mixed in with the normal
100:12 episodes so I understand you guys don't
100:16 get a chance to see them all so the cool
100:20 thing is is that you were thinking the
100:22 exact same thought I was thinking back
100:24 when I did the episode you understand
100:25 there's an association between the one
100:27 you just watched and the one you'd like
100:28 to see so it's my pleasure to point you
100:30 in the right direction at some point in
100:33 my life when I've got about a month off
100:34 I'm gonna go through and watch all the
100:38 episodes and try to do hot links between
100:40 the episodes when I refer to hey guys
100:42 you might want to go see the gravity
100:43 episode if you haven't seen that before
100:46 because it'll help you with this episode
100:47 but the little hot link in there but in
100:49 the description and fortunately that
100:53 interface is not something I can do in
100:56 final cut where I do all my uploading so
100:59 I already watched these episodes you
101:00 know I have to do that the two-hour
101:02 episode and then I have to watch it for
101:04 two hours and cut out any of those
101:06 smoking pauses and yeah sometimes I'll
101:09 quote a fact wrong like dammit and I
101:10 have to cut out a whole section because
101:12 I've said something incorrect
101:13 I'll let the I let the buzz aldrin gus
101:18 grissom one go because it was attached
101:20 to some other statements I wanted to go
101:22 out so I just put a little annotation in
101:24 there so again some of you come in
101:25 through audio you'll hear a mistake and
101:29 I I can't annotate audio I mean I could
101:34 probably get in there put my voice and
101:35 go this is when your neuro reader got
101:37 his head stuck a possess the other one
101:40 is I am trying to go back if you guys
101:43 find mistakes I'll actually start
101:45 creating an errata section right it's
101:47 what they do with books technical books
101:49 that have mistakes in them so you go to
101:51 the publisher and they have a little
101:52 error section in there and I'll update
101:56 that from time to time it does I
101:58 understand injure the credibility of the
102:01 entire show when a mistake is allowed to
102:04 go out so I try to keep that from ever
102:07 happening anyway thanks for joining in
102:13 the show take care of yourself in
102:15 someone else I'm not seeing the next
102:17 deep thoughts over now
102:18 [Music]
102:27 you
