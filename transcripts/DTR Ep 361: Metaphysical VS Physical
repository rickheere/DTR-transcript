00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:36 so I'm sitting around my house I've had
00:38 a pretty amazing day I visited with a
00:42 good friend of mine hadn't seen in a
00:45 while which is always fantastic and he
00:51 turned me on to this amazing gentleman
00:55 which I'm going to do a massive deep
00:58 dive on it'll probably take a month if
01:00 not more
01:01 gie his name is Gert g f-- g u rd g je
01:08 FF this gentleman has parsed the
01:13 universe he's born in mid-1800s it dies
01:17 in the late thirties not belief and my
01:21 buddy had to do a presentation on him or
01:23 a little sorry I movie before this fifth
01:27 press company he narrated it I'll
01:30 probably put it up there for you guys to
01:31 see did a brilliant job but it really
01:35 sparks me for my infinity project which
01:39 is some of you might remember I think I
01:42 revealed it in the vacuum episode just
01:46 I've been trying to create a language
01:49 that will merge metaphysics with physics
01:51 in a way that we can theoretically and
01:54 potentially mathematically address
01:58 infinity but also it's the physical
02:02 infinity and the spiritual infinity
02:05 because what's fascinating about it is
02:08 that we have where we are a being that
02:12 is made of the metaphysical and the
02:14 physical we are a soul and we are a body
02:18 i've pussy-footed around that notion
02:21 probably because in my own mind i hadn't
02:23 convinced myself of i guess i would say
02:27 I've never well since I realized this
02:30 was the case you know I'm one of
02:31 billions of people that have done it but
02:33 you feel a little insecure about
02:38 completely committing to such
02:40 intangible definition of who you are and
02:45 especially when you start to fold it out
02:47 to the the universe and your your fellow
02:52 citizens and you start to think okay if
02:54 we were this how would that change how
02:57 we interact with each other what other
03:02 Sciences immediately become revealed
03:09 this guy's got some piece-of-shit car
03:12 out there backfiring and what would be
03:15 the use of any language or process or
03:20 symbolism literally you could write down
03:23 if it didn't immediately have some
03:25 promise of solving problems and so I'm
03:30 at that precipice in the project where I
03:32 am now trying to take this these symbols
03:36 that I've created and start integrating
03:40 existing formulas that we do know exist
03:43 in the physical world which are where
03:45 everything exists and then some of the
03:48 things that have been philosophized in
03:52 the metaphysical world and I think from
03:55 this point forward until I have some
03:57 other further epiphany to deprecate this
04:00 notion that we are a symbiotic soul body
04:03 being you will always hear me reference
04:05 from this point forward with a fairly
04:08 stern level of confidence that that is
04:10 exactly what we are but it's one thing
04:14 to say we call those clouds up there
04:17 before we have the ability to a v8 to
04:20 them sample them and figure out what
04:22 they're actually made of we still called
04:23 them clouds and that's the exact same
04:26 thing that we have to do with
04:28 referencing our souls at least at the
04:32 entry level of the game but the
04:35 beautiful thing is we are those souls I
04:39 was sitting in my uncle's backyard I
04:41 think I might have mentioned this one
04:42 time and of all the episodes of sitting
04:44 in my uncle's backyard I was heavy into
04:46 poetry writing the [ __ ] out of stuff and
04:49 I would just
04:52 there was always a chord to the universe
04:54 in my brain for poetry and when you when
04:58 I tried to write something I was about
05:00 to give advice when I wrote something
05:02 personally it was usually crap when I
05:05 became nothing more than the vessel to
05:08 write it was beautiful
05:09 and if you're a good person and you have
05:17 unanimously refused evil to be a part of
05:20 your life you're sort of in a hallowed
05:24 ground within your soul and your mind
05:27 and your body constantly it doesn't mean
05:30 you're perfect you make big mistakes
05:31 you'll say things that are foul that you
05:33 shouldn't say but you again your intent
05:39 is simply being corrupted by your
05:41 naivete so you're going to those dark
05:44 places simply because you're dumb you're
05:52 ignorant
05:52 I shouldn't say you're dumb you're
05:53 ignorant to other ways of communicating
05:57 but I wrote this poem that I initially
05:59 called truth and this isn't a poem that
06:02 I mean this is a subject that the way I
06:05 wrote it was profound to me I must have
06:08 been I don't know how old I was
06:13 maybe my late 20s early 30s maybe I feel
06:18 like I was in my late 20s irrelevant
06:22 though when I was running this I got to
06:25 the infinite loop of truth and the
06:28 Enigma of truth and it's this bizarre
06:31 thing it may not be an enigma and it may
06:33 not be a paradox but it feels that way
06:36 sometimes which is this is it possible
06:41 to define ourselves as to what we are
06:45 when we are the self that we are
06:47 defining it would seem that someone
06:50 could look at someone else and you look
06:52 at a cat and you go cat tell me who you
06:54 are what I mean well you're a CAD you
06:58 are the cat so tell me you should know
07:00 all about cats because you are a cat I
07:02 don't know I just am what I am I have an
07:06 stinks for programming I kind of lounge
07:07 around a little bit you know a little
07:09 bit of this a little bit of that I
07:10 didn't really think about Who I am or
07:12 whatever what I mean I'm just this thing
07:16 and so inside this poem I was struggling
07:19 and I was having the Epiphany was a
07:22 little deep thoughts moment of this
07:23 epiphany where I'm writing and I'm
07:24 learning at the same exact time because
07:26 the words don't feel like they're mine
07:28 step into all the time people I don't
07:33 know if I can define who I am because I
07:37 am that person I am an element of the
07:40 compound of truth we like to think of
07:44 truth as an element don't we
07:46 it's none divisible it simply is the
07:49 truth is actually potentially at any
07:53 level of magnitude there are truths at
07:57 the human level there's truths at the
07:58 god level isn't God everything
08:01 everything in the universe our sustainer
08:04 our maintainer so truth can be big and
08:10 complex omnipotent is there a
08:15 singularity of truth I don't know you
08:21 know that little feeling you have when
08:22 you have something on the tip of your
08:23 tongue an actor's name a movie name
08:26 something so I'm the tip of your tongue
08:29 oh my dad I just had it what is it again
08:31 and there's that epiphany moment that
08:35 feeling inside your chest of I'm gonna
08:37 get this I just had it which means I get
08:39 it again and all I need to do is just
08:42 loop don't get distracted shut the hell
08:44 up everyone stop counting if I'm
08:45 counting that kind of thing right and I
08:48 think that we overlooked that little
08:50 emotion because we are typically
08:51 frustrated when we want something we're
08:55 trying to retrieve something from the
08:57 universe from our self and we're
09:01 struggling I think that is a god-like
09:05 moment you know we type something into a
09:09 database to search Google whatever and
09:12 it's taking a little while to find it
09:14 especially when you try to find a file
09:16 on a Windows computer we GZ better pour
09:18 a pot of coffee for that [ __ ]
09:19 experience you're waiting anticipating
09:24 you want to get on with life give me the
09:26 results because I got more things to do
09:28 once these results come back that's what
09:31 I'm feeling when I think about trying to
09:35 split this atom of thought this
09:39 singularity concept of this touchpoint
09:46 between the soul and the body so we can
09:50 sit and philosophize about the soul I
09:52 have a whole episode on the soul I can't
09:55 remember if it's any good but we know
09:59 the way that we behave and we know for
10:02 those of us that haven't been raised
10:04 inside some crazy Eyes Wide Shut world
10:07 where you know the elite pound us so
10:11 badly as children we have no empathy and
10:12 we end up some reptilian robot when we
10:15 have love and empathy and we enjoy
10:19 kindness we are living in the bosom of
10:22 God's smorgasbord his panacea of
10:27 emotions and so even though we do not
10:32 have the complete menu of his options
10:35 for us as these beings we know a lot we
10:41 know a lot of the core stuff but what
10:44 about that touch point how do you mend
10:47 or meld excuse me create an interface
10:51 between oil and water I believe that you
10:58 know frenum I was reminding me that the
10:59 Hutchison effect was able to blend the
11:03 claim was they were able to blend wood
11:05 into metal and Mike's my explanation for
11:11 that is he was fiddling with the very
11:14 frequencies of energy that is wood and
11:18 metal and instead of them being opposing
11:22 forces or unique elements of which do
11:26 not share their spiral configurations of
11:30 ether he was able to make them dance
11:33 with sacred geometry as injected into
11:37 those elements or projected onto those
11:39 elements with electricity and
11:42 electromagnetism and he was able to make
11:45 them get along that's interesting that's
11:50 a bit of a metaphor for this this
11:54 undefinable moment when our body
11:56 connects with our soul or really it's
11:59 the other way around chronologically
12:00 speaking but let's throw something else
12:04 out there while I'm naked about it would
12:07 you want God to reveal to you that when
12:11 it really comes down to it you're just a
12:14 Swiss Swiss watch inside even your soul
12:20 is just a microprocessor or an automatic
12:26 transmission but do you really want to
12:30 know that you're a mechanical device he
12:34 made you and that's great or does your
12:38 hubris want you to believe that you are
12:42 something so existentially more
12:44 beautiful than that an apparition do you
12:48 take solace in the fact that we are
12:50 intangible because it feels way more
12:54 cool doesn't it when I watched Westworld
13:01 and re-watching with a friend of mine
13:04 there seems to be this thing of when I
13:10 watch it you know there's a part of me
13:12 that says you know it is so beautifully
13:14 written to ride that fine line between
13:17 sentient Android I guess and sentient
13:21 human I would say that in just in that
13:25 show alone they've proven that the
13:28 androids became far more beautiful and
13:30 sentient than any human being in that
13:32 [ __ ] place besides maybe Bernard and
13:35 Ford and a few of the other people that
13:37 work in the staff because the people
13:39 visiting beside Harris's character they
13:45 were Neanderthals
13:46 primitive embarrassing would we be mad
13:51 if we were machines you know maybe again
13:55 we're not ether all machines maybe were
13:57 love machines but what would we be if we
14:02 weren't machines what is the other
14:06 definition all right so you you think of
14:11 yourself in some existential apparition
14:13 a vaporous cloud all right
14:18 does that make you feel better I'll be
14:23 honest I don't want to be a machine my
14:28 it's for some reason the definition of
14:31 man being a machine is will one in terms
14:38 of mechanical machine as we observe the
14:41 brain and the chemicals that go through
14:42 our body the nervous system beautiful
14:44 invention the human body
14:46 no no doubt hats off to the man but it
14:50 doesn't seem complex enough to explain
14:53 in any way shape or form this state of
14:55 consciousness that we have does it and
14:58 so we would think that if we were
15:02 mechanical that the level of
15:07 intelligence that we would have to put
15:09 into a single paradigm of existence
15:13 would be so absolutely phenomenal that
15:19 it couldn't fit in a normal world it was
15:23 like the deep thoughts computer creating
15:28 earth as that its successor computer
15:32 such a brilliant [ __ ] book man if you
15:34 I mean again if you want to listen to
15:36 Hitchhiker's Guide of the galaxy or you
15:37 want to get into that go get the BBC
15:39 broadcast the original and I'll warn you
15:43 the first four broadcasts were redone
15:45 after the first one because they used a
15:48 bunch of Pink Floyd music and all that
15:50 stuff and so they they were warned to
15:52 gotta rerecord those and when they
15:53 recorded them they lost a little bit of
15:55 the inflection from some of the actors
15:57 unfortunately but that's the we want to
15:59 hear because it's per
16:00 like that the books are chronologically
16:04 I think destroyed until the second third
16:08 book came out anyway but the story goes
16:12 is they invented a computer to answer
16:14 the question of life the universe and
16:15 everything and when it ran for 11
16:17 million years its answer was 42 and so
16:22 they were like what the hell is 40
16:24 tuning is well the problem is you
16:25 haven't really figured out what the
16:26 question is and he goes what come on
16:27 it's the question like the universe and
16:28 everything he says yeah but what is the
16:30 question and so he said I will invent a
16:34 computer that will come up with that
16:37 question and it was the planet Earth and
16:41 the original cavemen that were on the
16:43 planet which are not us by the way or
16:48 the organic matter that made up the
16:50 brain of this computer I mean just
16:54 beautiful and I haven't read every
16:57 science fiction book in the world so
16:58 perhaps he was lifting that off somebody
16:59 else but whoever thought of that is
17:02 incredibly ingenious
17:03 of course the mechanical machine that
17:06 would account for all of the beauty and
17:08 amazing original thought and original
17:11 conception that man creates the ie I
17:13 will never be able to do I mean a eyes
17:18 can imitate man that's about as good as
17:20 it could be it'd be a big Turing test
17:22 you know 8.0 or whatever but it's not
17:27 what we are we know we are dynamic and
17:30 sentient we're all a bunch of captain
17:33 kirk's as long as we don't smoke too
17:37 much weed it's a mind-blower isn't it
17:43 what is our soul what is it made out of
17:47 how complex is it if I went to a college
17:51 course taught by God what would that
17:55 homework look like what would the book
17:58 look like what would be the very first
18:01 day of soul construction 101 fascinating
18:08 to think about what that first lesson
18:10 might sound like
18:12 in my infiniti project I've got to
18:15 answer these questions to quantify oil
18:19 and water without a Hutchison effect
18:24 because these two are one they influence
18:29 each other but we know the human body
18:34 can be pulverized in death and yet the
18:39 soul doesn't die it's not as if you know
18:43 you're if you just die in bed while your
18:45 soul is totally fine and then it goes on
18:47 but if you're crushed by a giant Ganic
18:49 shipping container oh no your souls
18:51 completely destroyed in that process and
18:53 you actually die you're totally
18:55 disappear ashes to ashes dust to dust
18:58 well we know that's not true either
19:01 what's interesting about the
19:05 conversations that we've had about
19:06 afterlife is that I think that if you
19:12 take the subject matter of afterlife and
19:14 the other subject matter that I've
19:17 covered several times about death the
19:21 fear of death and the fact that I guess
19:23 there are far more people in this
19:25 universe scared of death and I mean
19:27 terrified of death that I ever thought
19:31 existed and super brilliant intellectual
19:34 people most often have a fear of death
19:38 now there's there is a I don't want to
19:41 [ __ ] die and there's fear of death
19:43 there's that's two different things of
19:44 course you don't want to die there's
19:47 more to come and if you're in a
19:48 suffering bubble right now well time
19:50 heals all and the older you get the more
19:53 that cliche becomes true and you get
19:55 through all of your tough times the
19:58 unimaginable happens after you think you
20:00 can't live another second I've had it
20:04 happen to me numerous times but the
20:08 reason why I think I mean there's all
20:10 kinds of barriers to getting over the
20:12 hump of death to have a conversation
20:14 the doesn't sound like the new age
20:16 section in Barnes & Noble which has some
20:19 great material in it but it's always
20:21 promoted as oh you're in the cuckoo Wow
20:24 and of course just to make sure that you
20:26 do feel like a complete cuckoo they
20:30 publish horrible drivel right next to
20:35 great books now scientists don't want to
20:39 go there because then the Nerds
20:42 sociopaths of the world that have these
20:44 goddamn human sacrifice rituals within
20:48 the CERN Hadron Collider worshipping the
20:52 gods goddess of Shiva got us the
20:54 destruction goddess Shiva of destruction
20:58 I guess we might say that they're not
21:01 going to be important as as much anymore
21:04 because they can't conceive of this [ __ ]
21:06 I guess because you're so left brain and
21:08 you can only see a soul with your right
21:10 brain they don't lose their temporary
21:13 grasp on power which is why they you
21:17 know they persecute anyone who comes up
21:19 with a modern theory that contradicts
21:21 the old one that they injected into
21:22 their veins
21:25 so we sit here in this [ __ ] mode
21:29 paused in time slowed down in time we
21:36 need to collaborate in this project and
21:38 we don't have enough people that are
21:41 awake to create a community and because
21:46 so many things get thrown into the pile
21:48 I mean it baffles me how how many
21:53 intelligent people I meet that have such
21:55 contradicting paradigms of predicting
21:59 the future analyzing what we are not
22:03 realizing that you cannot have you
22:08 cannot have well I shouldn't say it but
22:12 some of these things directly oppose the
22:14 other you know astrology and numerology
22:17 going together is so hilarious to me and
22:21 I don't want to be told I don't [ __ ]
22:24 understand them because big [ __ ]
22:26 surprise that [ __ ] ain't that
22:27 complicated to understand okay
22:30 I'll be friendly to you if you tell me
22:32 that you believe that kind of stuff but
22:34 you're talking about completely
22:38 arbitrary [ __ ] systems of belief
22:42 numerology is the most highly
22:44 manipulated bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ]
22:46 ever now you can use it as a as a enigma
22:51 box to communicate in a queue post
22:53 that's not predicting the goddamn future
22:56 and stuff that's simply hiding numbers
22:58 inside so you can communicate and have a
23:00 protocol that goes back and forth if you
23:02 pick your decoder ring in your current
23:04 numerology and sure you can say okay
23:08 when you see the 17 that means this when
23:10 you see that that means but you gotta
23:11 use this particular numerology
23:13 calculator set to all this other [ __ ]
23:16 random stuff which is basically what
23:18 enigma box was and then just say oh no
23:22 no no it's the Stars the Stars well you
23:24 don't even know what the [ __ ] those
23:25 things are you don't you don't know any
23:28 goddamn thing about those things we know
23:33 so little about the moon we're still
23:37 lying to ourselves about what's at the
23:38 core of the earth and you want to tell
23:41 me that you understand the Stars so
23:42 [ __ ] well it's gonna predict your
23:44 future tell you what kind of person you
23:47 are don't do that to yourself don't
23:52 surrender your chance to become a
23:55 sentient human being with real
23:58 information derived from your very
24:00 existence by coward endowment that was
24:04 invented for evented by you know
24:08 backyard mystics that tell people how
24:12 their world work when they were using
24:14 you know [ __ ] leeches to solve their
24:18 health problems when they had headaches
24:20 they [ __ ] you know hammered a goddamn
24:22 hole in your brain st. marys of when
24:27 this stuff came out and it's been
24:30 massaged and changed because as people
24:32 reveal the hoax they [ __ ] we gotta make
24:35 this stuff seem complicated again and
24:36 legit again oh yeah
24:38 yeah but we put applesauce in there [ __ ]
24:41 yeah applesauce it's the dark matter
24:43 applesauce theory they solved all the
24:46 problems all I should have told you
24:49 before is all vague and we got it all
24:50 fixed up now mmm this is why we can't
24:54 focus on what the hell's going on in
24:56 this universe because we're often this
24:59 Candyland [ __ ] world you know I
25:02 respect beyond anything an individual's
25:06 desire to find these truths so when I
25:11 hear people into these things I'm like
25:13 okay what's cool about you is that
25:15 you're looking you're really looking but
25:19 it's kind of like people who travel
25:21 through life and you know one year
25:25 they're in a paleo diet second year
25:28 they're a vegetarian third year they're
25:30 a vegan fourth year they're trying to
25:32 live off sunlight and every time they
25:36 visit your house you get a circle with
25:37 them boy everything they had before was
25:39 [ __ ] and what they're in now is
25:40 completely it that is not the kind of
25:45 person I typically could have a
25:47 tremendous conversation with outlet I do
25:49 like to hear their journey well what do
25:51 you think about that what was the
25:52 transition I will say though this has
25:58 been a theme in my life personally in
25:59 the last say almost ten years there are
26:05 a lot of I'll say technologies out there
26:10 and their technologies for the mind I
26:14 did a whole episode about technologies
26:16 at the bind which has a different tense
26:17 it's that episodes about how the elite
26:20 know how to program our minds and
26:22 beliefs in paradigms and they use that
26:24 technology of the mind to screw us and
26:26 this conversation I'm talking about
26:28 something different a church would be a
26:32 technology a protocol to how to behave
26:35 what Jesus Christ brought everyone was a
26:38 new technology to upgrade the operating
26:40 system from the Old Testament Old
26:43 Testaments 1.0 jesus christ is 2.0 okay
26:46 there you go you could probably
26:51 keep and Jesus didn't come and say okay
26:53 all that Old Testament stuff is
26:54 completely gone he just simply said when
26:56 it comes time to like saving your soul
26:58 and and sinning in the original sin and
27:00 all that kind of stuff well I got a
27:04 better way to do this but there are
27:07 organizations out there which calls the
27:09 call themselves business schools some of
27:14 them are horribly permitted and they do
27:16 force recruitment on you like crazy
27:18 because the people who are who could
27:20 give a [ __ ] about any of it who are
27:21 casting all your goddamn checks and
27:23 living wherever the hell they want to
27:24 live they're laughing all the way to the
27:26 bank with this devoutness of their
27:28 followers happens all the time now
27:33 sometimes a great person will create a
27:35 technology and it might be and it might
27:39 end up being called a church at the end
27:40 but whatever who cares it's a protocol
27:43 it's a method of living rules that for
27:47 some people work extremely well but it's
27:49 only to the degree you can understand
27:51 the methodologies and the science and
27:54 the technology that will give you either
27:56 a positive or negative when you're done
27:58 and then people inherit these
28:01 organizations after the founders pass
28:03 away and they can take it to a dark
28:06 place sometimes families have reputable
28:11 members of their family tree for as far
28:14 back as they know no one did anything
28:16 weird and then you'll have a family
28:20 member in your family most families I
28:24 think have one of these where you had a
28:27 creepy uncle there's a family with a lot
28:31 of brothers and sisters and one of the
28:33 brothers fell in love with his sister
28:35 and so we did inappropriate things that
28:38 happens too and so you know that if
28:44 someone were to write an essay on your
28:47 surname and your family that you're
28:50 gonna hope to god no one finds out that
28:52 very private stuff about your family
28:58 because it might spread to be a judgment
29:02 on you or the majority of the family
29:05 that didn't do any of these things I've
29:08 seen these events happen where people
29:12 are falsely accused that kind of stuff
29:15 and I've seen one where they lived way
29:19 too long after what they did I've seen
29:26 both sides of that game so these
29:30 institutions can get those sort of
29:33 deprecated reputations some of them are
29:39 pure evil from the very beginning I
29:43 mentioned these technologies and these
29:46 various institutions some of which are
29:47 just oil and water to each other because
29:52 there's a lot of information out there
29:55 like this gentleman I'm gonna go
29:57 research Gorge 'if if we had an
30:02 institution that was financed to bring
30:05 together the finest minds in the world
30:07 all vetted for their left-right balanced
30:12 we bring them in and we give them after
30:14 two tests of left brine
30:16 left right brain active activity and
30:20 maturity prior to letting them in the
30:23 institution and then as we let them well
30:26 as we assign them to their group and
30:29 assign their tasks we do it
30:31 proportionate to their ability of having
30:34 a left and right brain activity being
30:36 integrated so we could bring an
30:38 amazingly astute left brain people and
30:41 then far out right brain people all
30:45 centered they're not vacillating between
30:48 these companies competing philosophies
30:50 and so you know it's like the person
30:53 that believes everything that they read
30:56 gotta be careful so we want the highest
30:58 integrity people but we bring him into
31:00 the institution and what would be the
31:02 very first step of the institution if
31:05 our goal was to develop a language by
31:09 which the left and right brain could
31:11 communicate the soul and the body
31:17 the body being the left brain and the
31:20 soul being the right brain I think that
31:23 the most basic scientific approach would
31:26 be to harvest all of the data that has
31:29 ever been written from the oldest
31:33 scripts of perhaps Babylonian time all
31:39 the way up to present time bringing in
31:42 individuals that have PhDs in these
31:45 areas so we can immediately get to it
31:47 without having to redo this potentially
31:51 a 30 year journey of someone imagine
31:53 getting all these professors in there
31:54 that are so worried about someone
31:57 contradicting them and say look no no
31:59 you're gonna be completely rewarded for
32:01 your knowledge in something that may be
32:03 a hundred percent untrue or we may
32:06 reward you because you are going to be
32:09 giving birth to old philosophies that
32:13 you knew the entire time you were
32:15 studying it for thirty years of your
32:16 life was the way that the world should
32:20 work I mean I should be I should
32:23 actually crease that to about a 50 year
32:25 study people in their 70s 80s 90s
32:28 they're geniuses in these other areas of
32:31 thinking but we bring it together we
32:34 harvest all the records and we started
32:37 to meticulously find the touch points of
32:41 people's thinking over the millennia as
32:46 to how the soul operates in relation to
32:49 the human body from Hindu philosophers
32:52 and this would be a global effort
32:54 wouldn't it but he would take all the
32:58 technologies from every religion from
33:01 every business school from Tony Robbins
33:04 to something else
33:07 Scientology dig into l ron Hubbard dig
33:11 into you know Plato and Socrates and
33:16 everyone who's ever talked about
33:18 anything the Shambhala logs and the
33:22 Marshall McLuhan's and all the Forgotten
33:25 heroes just like those individuals bring
33:30 it together and see if we
33:31 come up with a unified technology that
33:34 is the highest level of integrity of
33:38 both paradigm and communication across
33:43 the paradigm have a have an elimination
33:48 process just like a big eSports event
33:52 you know well and the thing is bi and
33:57 churning the data and perhaps returning
33:59 it and returning it and going backwards
34:01 and forwards and backwards and forwards
34:02 and just trying to see if perhaps
34:04 something we didn't understand instead
34:06 of throwing it away it was on a very
34:09 special pile that says this is the pile
34:13 that needs to be extra analyzed because
34:15 we can't find out we can't determine
34:17 exactly what these individuals meant
34:19 they obviously had an idea when they
34:21 wrote it down now some might be very
34:22 simplistic and we can say ah that's
34:25 covered by this more advanced version of
34:28 the theory this person stood on this
34:30 person's shoulders so we give credit to
34:32 the individuals that did that
34:34 no one's ego should be involved but we
34:36 you should know about you know we should
34:40 know I think the time table that man has
34:42 consumed in order to gain this
34:44 enlightenment I think that might be a
34:45 fascinating sort of genealogy of these
34:49 ideas and these concepts you know when
34:52 they had the genome project the training
34:55 sequence all of the nucleic acids in the
35:00 strand of a DNA the folding at home
35:04 project is trying to figure out all the
35:06 proteins function within the human body
35:08 the true genius of our of our ability to
35:12 exist but it was very mathematical
35:17 looking at the nucleic acid chain
35:19 combinations it was a mathematical look
35:22 look look look
35:25 write it down write it down computer
35:28 does all the rest of the mulching finds
35:31 the patterns but think about what the
35:35 computer can't do they can't get in
35:38 there and get into the philosophy and
35:40 the undiscovered missing link DNA of our
35:43 existence
35:45 if you want to know how stupid DNA is
35:47 gonna be a thousand years from now ask
35:51 it what exists after this life and this
35:56 we have new mechanical machines that can
35:58 sense the soul and sends God and look at
36:01 the entire nervous system of this
36:03 universe of the matrix of the matrix
36:06 outside the matrix
36:07 there'll be no way for this AI to do
36:10 anything it's going to simply know what
36:12 we've told it and yes I'm aware that
36:15 they're hooking a eyes to a is but
36:17 honestly will the computer ever know
36:21 what it really is can it figure out it's
36:25 in a box somewhere with fans blowing and
36:28 it needs energy I mean the movie matrix
36:30 was beautiful that it actually had sort
36:32 of explained these these robots that
36:35 were harvesting human energy you don't
36:39 as far as I remember out of the three
36:43 movies that were made there was never an
36:45 attempt to say the chicken and the egg
36:47 went one way or the other
36:49 did they incubate us did we incubate
36:52 them they tend to they tend to give the
36:55 idea that we run off their power or we
36:56 they run off our power seems like we may
37:01 have gone first maybe not but I think
37:06 about trying to create a project where
37:08 we think like this it would have to be
37:13 funded by individuals who simply want to
37:17 know the answer and it is so absolutely
37:20 important to them but they're willing to
37:24 sacrifice their hard-earned money their
37:25 kalbarri energy converted into monetary
37:27 units to be able to potentially
37:31 contribute to this answer but now let's
37:35 think about it let's say we kick off
37:38 this project January 1st 2020 and there
37:42 are enough people to put together a host
37:46 of buildings we write a gigantic
37:50 business plan for the entire thing it
37:53 would be interesting as we eat
37:55 metaphorically the combination of a
37:57 syllabus
37:58 and a business plan mixing it together a
38:00 non-profit and a profit paradigm being
38:04 mixed together but if there was a person
38:08 who was 80 years old sitting on top of
38:11 some giant cash pile and said you know
38:15 what I'm old and you know maybe I live
38:18 another 10 years 15 years maybe even 20
38:21 years and I'm gonna make this money
38:24 available for you to build this
38:25 institution and bring together the
38:27 greatest minds in the world hopefully
38:28 they're one of the participants
38:31 someone's got to be in charge that's the
38:33 other thing that's really tough to sort
38:34 out they may not hear any answer from
38:39 the deep thoughts computer in their
38:42 lifetime and so they're going to have to
38:46 revel in the fact that what they left
38:49 behind was an opportunity for men to
38:51 solve some of this question this nagging
38:56 question of life the universe and
38:59 everything what are we I often wonder
39:03 and I've said this in several episodes
39:05 but do I really want all the answers
39:08 let's say when I die maybe it's a
39:11 privilege that I've always had this kind
39:13 of a notion that and I don't really
39:15 visually see it this way I'm gonna make
39:17 this up on the spot here but this idea
39:19 that let's just say God had a gigantic
39:24 library with every single book about
39:27 everything and it is for the very first
39:29 time in your life a hundred percent true
39:33 close your eyes grab a book open it to a
39:36 page and behold the truth I mean wow I
39:43 mean wow would that not be an epic
39:47 moment in a movie but the question is
39:51 and well maybe further the theory one
39:54 more step why would God keep it in books
39:58 individual tomes of truth and the
40:02 beautiful answer would be because you
40:06 don't want to know it all at once unless
40:08 you be guide yourself
40:10 and us carry the burden of God and so
40:15 you get to selectively ingest portions
40:20 of truth it does take time to read it
40:23 and ingest it and understand it
40:25 hopefully God's a really good writer
40:27 mm-hmm it was anything like Jean
40:29 Baudrillard we're gonna need a
40:30 respirator to get through the book when
40:35 I was a child I used to think of it I
40:37 guess I probably still think of it a
40:38 little bit like this I saw myself as a
40:42 kid probably because of the many
40:45 descriptions of death and the notion of
40:48 floating away from your body because I
40:52 was a little cosmologists of my own
40:55 little astronomer I immediately took
40:59 myself away from the Earth's surface and
41:02 I was thinking as I'm backing away from
41:04 Earth I'm having a warm comforting
41:07 feeling there's no more pain anymore
41:09 in fact there's no concept of pain
41:11 anymore
41:13 except that I'm reveling the fact that
41:15 it ain't happening and all the knowledge
41:19 of the universe is pouring through me
41:22 what were the dinosaurs did they exist
41:25 how was the universe created did that
41:29 girl in the sixth grade playground
41:30 actually like me or not I don't know but
41:34 all those things are made available and
41:36 then even as a kid I thought mmm maybe I
41:41 don't want to know what all at once
41:42 maybe that'd just be taking all the fun
41:44 out of it it's like again it's like
41:47 playing a video game and going into god
41:49 mode it immediately becomes incredibly
41:52 boring I think it'd be an interesting
41:55 scientific experiment and maybe
41:57 Nintendo's done this experiment cuz they
42:00 do all kinds of wild lab stuff take a
42:03 bunch of kids on their favorite games
42:05 and that they've never played in god
42:09 mode these individuals have never done
42:10 it before and let them play it for a
42:12 while maybe give him a new level where
42:14 it's just so exciting but it's really
42:16 hard but they really want to play it and
42:18 then say okay we're gonna put this into
42:20 God mode and play as aggressively as you
42:23 feel like you need to
42:24 and tell us when you feel bored and find
42:27 out how short that span is because I
42:29 think it's a very very short time span I
42:31 think in my own life as a game designer
42:35 from birth I think my average is about
42:38 15 minutes and I'm done I played like I
42:42 keep saying I keep playing Fallout 4
42:44 I've played in several weeks if not
42:46 months and I turn on every one Swan it's
42:49 kind of an interesting fun alternate
42:51 world to go home to it's [ __ ] up
42:54 pizzetta's and I put it in god mode once
42:58 because I was like wow there's all these
42:59 wild mods that go in there I turn it on
43:01 it was just abysmal I turned them all
43:04 off really quick I didn't like anything
43:05 to do with I was like I got pistol and I
43:07 could kill anything with one shot which
43:10 is almost the case that whenever 136
43:12 level I am so we're not gonna get that
43:15 University we're not going to get those
43:17 donators we're not gonna get any devoted
43:19 effort to this endeavor so we're left
43:25 and literally in a back yard talking
43:27 into a microphone hoping that through
43:30 this sort of distributed computer
43:36 network that we have that's sort of like
43:37 the SETI project or the folding at home
43:39 project it's our brains we're harvesting
43:43 a bunch of brains together to think
43:45 about these things and because not
43:46 everyone is interested in this
43:48 existential stuff or perhaps they don't
43:50 have initially the understanding of what
43:53 we're talking about
43:54 hopefully they pursue and get on board
43:57 we are maybe kicking off from an episode
44:02 I'm putting a little Stubbs in your
44:04 brain of things that we need to talk
44:06 about
44:06 I can't assign it to anyone because I
44:09 don't know anyone you guys come back in
44:12 the comments section and then we
44:13 continue and continue you mature me you
44:16 advanced my knowledge pointing me in
44:18 directions I try to do my best to get
44:21 into all this stuff deeply and then I
44:23 make more episodes and maybe I surmise
44:25 the research the listeners have done
44:28 with my own research I mean make another
44:30 video part two or we give it a different
44:32 name when we're trying to do this
44:35 distributed CPU
44:37 deep thoughts computer we are
44:41 technically at that point with a
44:44 directive we go from being a chaotic
44:46 mess on the surface of this planet to
44:49 being the true computer the deep
44:51 thoughts invented in the Hitchhiker's
44:54 Guide at the galaxy I think what's sort
44:58 of it's sort of sad that we could be you
45:05 know on the internet chatting with each
45:06 other and realize like dr. Steven Greer
45:10 said in his serious project whatever is
45:15 a serious movie he said look there's no
45:17 country on earth that has set forth an
45:20 objective like JFK to get to the moon in
45:23 order to create a zero-point energy
45:25 system boy if that doesn't reveal a deep
45:29 state I don't know what does I don't
45:33 know what does that's reprehensible I
45:37 think it's equally reprehensible that we
45:39 don't have these global projects I know
45:41 there's think tanks that I have no idea
45:43 about and of course there's a bunch of
45:44 [ __ ] black projects out there that do
45:47 hundreds of millions if not billions of
45:49 dollars with the researches research
45:51 into these things I mean the
45:52 intelligence agencies of the world have
45:54 done efforts like this I am aware of
45:56 that but without the without the
45:59 research results being published to the
46:02 public of which we [ __ ] paid for they
46:06 have all the knowledge and we don't of
46:08 course why are they trying to use it
46:09 they're trying to weaponize it all I
46:12 think what a lot of us are trying to get
46:15 to with some of this technology
46:17 enlightenment is that we want to Hubble
46:21 criminals we want the the ultimate
46:28 denominator right the equalizer I should
46:31 say where anyone who wants to bully
46:36 someone else in any way shape or form
46:38 academically physically what-have-you
46:41 spiritually that you can just one you
46:44 immediately know what's happening
46:45 because we've made you know one of these
46:49 things is not like the other it
46:51 he sticks out and we're like oh I'm very
46:54 sorry that you feel like you need to
46:55 dominate me in your life but because
46:59 I've got this widget of knowledge I'm
47:03 going to neutralize you from being able
47:05 to do that to me and then we'll talk
47:08 about your therapy I'm gonna ask nicely
47:11 before I anelia
47:13 and then it's over you're not gonna do
47:15 that to me anymore
47:16 and because now we've identified you as
47:18 a problem in society and we're gonna
47:21 alert the rest of society that we have
47:23 one that's got a big problem
47:26 unfortunately these individuals cabal
47:29 together don't they so it's a big mess
47:35 so that's what appeals to me about doing
47:39 this show is that we get a secret little
47:42 Club and how I say secret because were
47:45 shadow band not because we want to be
47:49 some you know the next Masonic club of
47:52 any kind we want the world to know we
47:56 want the world to think we want that
47:58 five-year-old girl to go oh well isn't
48:02 it just like this and we all go holy
48:05 crap you're right honey you're right and
48:09 how our brains go poof you know because
48:11 they're so simplified by A Beautiful
48:14 Mind would it be interesting mm-hmm I'm
48:19 sure someone has given this analogy
48:20 before but for me it just became a new
48:22 one would it be interesting if the most
48:26 enlightened beings on this planet our
48:30 children and the stupidest creatures are
48:34 adults and that because we minimize out
48:39 of sheer narcissistic post adolescent
48:45 development we minimize children when
48:50 they have all the answers and then all
48:55 we need to do is sit down with children
48:58 and present our case to them as if they
49:02 are little gods
49:04 you know before we corrupt them with our
49:06 biases racism or what have you we work
49:11 with them to get the answers out of them
49:13 before they lose connection with the
49:15 universe instead of indoctrinating them
49:17 away from their pure state that it
49:19 happens after birth instead of
49:23 subtracting what they know we get it out
49:27 of them you know what's interesting
49:30 about this process of social media you
49:37 know it's like almost like a social
49:39 media talk show that we have here as
49:43 people will give me amazing references
49:45 and by all means I want you to continue
49:46 doing that but there is a bit of a
49:50 resistance I have sometimes with certain
49:53 subjects because I feel like I want to
49:57 do my own research first my own
49:59 philosophical diving first before I take
50:02 someone else's paradigm into
50:04 consideration because I feel that when I
50:07 do it first I understand the reference
50:11 material much deeper than if I let
50:14 reference material set up all the
50:16 borders around my mind okay this is a
50:17 four sided room not an eight sided room
50:20 oh well I thought when I okay you know
50:23 it's like you give up on your own
50:24 instincts and perhaps the reference
50:27 comes from a time that goes back way too
50:29 far you know if I read a piece of
50:33 reference from you know 20 BC maybe it's
50:38 not sophisticated enough to address what
50:42 my mind would have done with it had I
50:43 created original research at 20 19 I'd
50:49 like to encourage all of you to do that
50:50 from time to time you know one of the
50:53 things I do on the show is I try to say
50:55 that if you know what if it was our job
50:57 to do something how would we do it
50:59 without any formal degrees and anything
51:02 you just have your incidental knowledge
51:03 you out there you have a degree but you
51:05 don't have some massive PhD and exactly
51:08 we're talking about instead of that we
51:12 have to sit down at the table and
51:16 you know brainstorm write stuff on the
51:19 board come together year after year
51:22 after year pushing together everything
51:24 that we know prior to doing research
51:28 what that does is that pioneers your
51:31 mind to think because as you're
51:34 contemplating a concept you're trying to
51:36 solve the first thing you try to do
51:38 typically is to find the the extent of
51:40 the problem if you were to come into
51:45 like let's just say I came into a
51:46 classroom in a school and the classroom
51:49 is notorious this particular class is a
51:52 combination of kids that are just bad
51:54 they've been taught wrong
51:56 they've got someone's got a bad home or
51:58 something you have to look around that
52:01 class and go oh my god
52:02 how many kids might dealing with their
52:05 you know maybe you teach seven hours a
52:08 day and so you're like okay my first
52:11 hour is pretty good second I was just
52:12 [ __ ] nightmare and then it kind of
52:15 gets better better than he was really
52:17 worse after lunch because all the kids
52:18 are tired after eating food maybe
52:21 they're nuts because they've drinking a
52:22 bunch of energy drinks at lunch time you
52:26 need to figure out the extent of the
52:28 problem you're trying to solve now
52:29 that's a very physical analogy but
52:31 imagine trying to solve for the extent
52:33 of the soul we don't know how big it is
52:36 we don't know what its responsibilities
52:38 are to be honest I think we understand a
52:42 lot of its spectrum but perhaps if one
52:44 says the soul marries the body and
52:47 therefore has a paradigm of limitation
52:50 then perhaps the soul has an infinite
52:53 number of additional emotions additional
52:56 things that occur when freed from the
52:58 human body our dreams
53:01 what if our dreams are the playground
53:02 for the soul well dreams are pretty
53:05 freeform like they you can do anything
53:08 in a dream if it can be conceived it
53:11 happens hmm interesting so I think that
53:18 to define some parameters is where my
53:22 Infinity project comes in we have to be
53:26 able to deal with the infinite unknown
53:28 as well as these
53:30 expected infinite known or the
53:34 absolutely implicit infinity that we
53:37 know that exists like a number set
53:40 infinitely divisible infinitely
53:44 exponential isn't amazing that we will
53:49 live potentially in this universe
53:52 forever and will never ever ever ever be
53:59 able to conceive of all the numbers that
54:01 exist
54:04 our numbers just a metaphysical
54:10 construct I don't know I certainly like
54:16 having two cookies more than one you
54:21 know they do exist like to have more
54:24 money in the bank than less money in the
54:26 bank we like to have more love than less
54:29 love seems that we quantify things to
54:34 deal with our paradigm as if it's just
54:36 simply the first building block of
54:39 dimension I think it might be
54:43 interesting to parse the notion of what
54:45 what matters to the soul and what
54:47 matters to the body a body is a ever
54:53 changing ever recreating paradigm that
54:58 has strategic resources by which if not
55:00 consumed we die water food sunlight but
55:10 wait we need love to exist and some of
55:16 you might just get all that's ridiculous
55:17 no we do the babies that aren't held and
55:21 hugged die because the soul says oops I
55:26 must be in the wrong place in time these
55:30 human beings don't understand human life
55:32 to the degree that they don't pick me up
55:35 and hold me and love me so perhaps
55:38 there's a strategic resource of love
55:40 that comes from one soul that feeds into
55:43 the soul of the child
55:44 just like water or milk from a breast it
55:48 must come from one place and enter into
55:52 the child because only human beings or a
55:55 soul symbiotic creature can give that
55:59 love into a child at least at the
56:01 quality of which a human body soul would
56:04 need it'll perish if it doesn't get it
56:08 and maybe you could take a baby and
56:11 surrounded by a bunch of puppy dogs that
56:13 love it to death but perhaps that's not
56:16 compatible it's good love trust me but
56:20 it's not enough
56:21 a puppy can't pick up a baby and hold it
56:24 against its bosom I know there's some
56:28 cute videos where dogs hug babies but
56:31 we're talking about everyday hour to
56:35 hour until that child can start living
56:39 on its own touch points between the soul
56:43 and the body that's the mystery where
56:48 does it touch how does it touch how is
56:53 it that when you tell a lie and someone
56:58 catches you in it you blush I had a boss
57:03 that told a big lie to me one day he was
57:08 he was very insecure about me being in
57:11 the company and he kind of thought it
57:14 was dominant species time and he needed
57:18 to get rid of me so he told me a lie
57:19 about my superiors essentially saying
57:23 that they all conceded or sorry
57:28 they had a consensus I should say they
57:30 agreed that I wasn't the type of
57:35 employee that should stay at the company
57:38 the problem is is he mentioned a person
57:41 who was an extremely close friend of
57:43 mine and so I knew he was lying he's a
57:48 bad liar anyway so once he said that I
57:52 had this huge relief off my system I was
57:55 well so-and-so and I are very close
57:59 friends something of which your dumb
58:01 [ __ ] brain couldn't pay attention to
58:03 even though her and I have been together
58:05 the entire time you've been at this
58:07 company having meetings for two or three
58:09 hours philosophizing about the world and
58:11 how to run companies and how to treat
58:14 employees correctly but he was such a
58:16 narcissistic [ __ ]
58:18 this guy my god he didn't pick up on it
58:22 because he was an ignorant piece of [ __ ]
58:24 and so I said to him well I'm gonna go
58:26 up and talk to them that you just made a
58:29 big claim and we'll get to the bottom of
58:31 this this dude had dark skin to begin
58:35 with he turned purple red
58:39 I am never seen a guy changed colors in
58:42 my [ __ ] life this guy would have made
58:44 a chameleon go goddamnit that was good
58:47 that was amazing
58:48 holy [ __ ] you changed colors more than I
58:50 can um he was fired 45 days later but it
58:56 was only because he got a 45 day
58:58 parachute guy was utterly liquidated his
59:02 reaction to me calling his bluff made
59:07 him change colors and I don't think his
59:09 body heard what I said
59:11 I think his soul heard what I said his
59:15 soul told his body you just [ __ ] up
59:19 dude and the body has a reaction to that
59:23 this guy was terrified instantaneously
59:27 he was acting on behalf of Satan if
59:30 there ever is anything like that he was
59:33 being pure evil [ __ ] and he's
59:36 probably different person today at that
59:38 time it was probably the lowest hour of
59:40 his life because I had maintained
59:42 integrity the entire time I've been at
59:44 this company I got to work there another
59:48 year made a ton of money to in a year so
59:54 we have our homework I'd like to suggest
60:02 plead with you guys but as you live your
60:05 daily lives please don't forget this one
60:07 little thing and if you can get an
60:11 analog pin and an analog piece of paper
60:15 maybe even a thing called a notebook I
60:17 use computational notebooks cuz they're
60:20 awesome
60:21 the gridded paper but start to write
60:25 down freeform thoughts into a notebook
60:27 about this subject of what evidence do
60:30 you have that would explain this
60:34 marriage between the soul and the body
60:36 what do you know about your soul what do
60:39 you know about your body that isn't
60:40 utterly trivial don't mind that crap
60:42 down I mean well maybe you can but
60:45 resource management might be one of the
60:47 more trivial things I need food I need
60:49 water and eat sunlight but go for that
60:52 weird Twilight Zone area that mezzanine
60:54 between consciousness and
60:56 unconsciousness let's start laser
61:00 focusing in on this
61:02 write it down let's do it over the next
61:05 year report in if you happen to have an
61:08 epiphany and please please please do not
61:11 hold it to yourself because you think
61:13 you're gonna make some goddamn money off
61:15 this thing right or you want to have all
61:17 this credit in the world that isn't
61:20 serving humanity at all it's not serving
61:22 you at all perhaps again you could only
61:24 take the first two steps to the
61:26 staircase
61:26 then I pick you up and I carry you one
61:29 step and someone picks us up and takes
61:31 us three more steps and then maybe I
61:33 rest up I take as one more step and some
61:35 other little five-year-old girl takes us
61:37 up eight steps that's the way we have to
61:41 approach this existence on this planet
61:44 your job it's for suckers man seriously
61:50 unless this is your job
61:52 let's pioneer you know well Magellan's
61:58 running around and Christopher Columbus
62:01 the pedophile murderer drug dealer was
62:04 running around the world claiming land
62:06 that people already lived on which is
62:08 Valerius that was lowbrow easy pickins
62:15 is bezel and over here what we are doing
62:18 is pioneering the metaphysical and if
62:25 there's a book out there that solves all
62:26 this crap for me if someone's like
62:27 you're just a dumbass read this book
62:29 okay then why doesn't everyone know it
62:33 these if these solutions exist I don't
62:35 think they do
62:36 I think people have talked about it I
62:39 don't want to hear any crap about the
62:42 Bible unless you break it down outside
62:46 of the Bible take your wisdom outside of
62:48 the Bible don't tell me what the Bible
62:50 says this Bible says that Jesus is I am
62:53 no interest in that approach
62:55 take it outside of this man-made
62:57 paradigm put it in God's realm and allow
63:02 us to discuss it as the men and women of
63:06 God without this horrific [ __ ] that man
63:10 puts around God if you feel like you
63:15 have to keep it in the Bible then you're
63:16 not ready for this class you're not
63:17 ready for this homework keep studying
63:19 keep studying - you figured out you
63:22 don't need to build your beliefs at all
63:24 just be able to communicate outside that
63:27 by this guy exists because God says
63:30 exists no that doesn't work
63:32 that's a circular logic problem anyway I
63:38 think it's all I got on this one I was
63:40 just feeling it had to get out and do it
63:41 I think it's about 45 degrees out here
63:44 so who loves you baby everyone i deep
63:50 thoughts radio.com loves you so go there
