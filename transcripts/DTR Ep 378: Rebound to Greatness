00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts today we're gonna do a bit
00:39 of a a bit of a repeat but a bit of a
00:44 valuable reminder and it was brought on
00:47 by one of the listeners who was
00:51 extremely inspired by the story of Tiger
00:53 Woods coming out of the funk he was in
00:55 and winning the Masters now not much of
00:59 a sports guy but it doesn't take doesn't
01:03 take much to realize that what he
01:04 accomplished was pretty significant now
01:08 I've got three episodes out there and
01:09 one's called getting up one's called
01:12 taking charge and the other one's called
01:13 reinventing yourself and if you were
01:17 willing to watch those three videos
01:18 you're gonna see a bit of duplication
01:22 with the content that's gonna be in this
01:24 show so what do I call this one if I've
01:28 already done something like this I think
01:32 one of the terms we talk about when you
01:34 see something that Tiger Woods did is
01:37 rebounding
01:39 you've rebound from a bad situation to a
01:43 situation that you may have thought well
01:45 maybe it's not possible now of course we
01:49 know the I mean I'm not a big sports fan
01:52 to begin with I love baseball it's my
01:54 main sport one can conversate during a
01:57 baseball game one can look at intricate
02:00 strategies with multiple layers and
02:02 baseball golf has its moments right what
02:08 I know is that Tiger Woods was
02:09 absolutely unequivocally on top and when
02:11 you get on top you get a level of
02:13 arrogance that is sort of an
02:15 invincibility shield because you have
02:18 worked really hard you're so good at
02:21 your craft that you can't fail and so
02:23 you take liberties and he did and he got
02:28 bit by it and it was hardly hardly the
02:32 worst story we've seen in sports
02:34 especially now that NFL guys seem to be
02:36 the rape or murder somebody they're
02:38 dating
02:39 monthly basis but doing what he did at
02:43 the age he did and winning the Masters
02:46 again is nothing short of absolutely
02:51 phenomenal it is so we're not probably
02:55 big giant sports fans or sorry sports
02:58 stars watching this show right and so
03:01 I'm definitely not one but life will
03:05 throw you some pretty crappy moments
03:08 every once in a while doesn't it and you
03:13 know what's interesting is as I might
03:15 tell a story that your life was fine and
03:17 then it went down and then it came back
03:18 up some of you might have the opinion
03:21 will [ __ ] man I don't know if I've ever
03:22 seen an up moment in my life maybe the
03:25 second half of this analogy is more
03:27 important to you than the first example
03:30 of what people might be going through
03:32 have been on top one of the most common
03:36 mistakes we make and I have made it
03:37 several times is when you're on top
03:39 which means you're there's three
03:42 hemispheres of life that I adhere to if
03:44 you watch season one especially I talk
03:46 about a lot which is the self work and
03:50 then family that's usually how you build
03:52 your life you have yourself you're not
03:54 married you have to get a job before you
03:57 even find a girl that's gonna pay
03:58 attention to or a guy I mean I'm I'm
04:00 always kind of biased because I'm a dude
04:02 we usually get your job some of you get
04:06 education to get the job big deal it's
04:08 part of the job anyway
04:09 and then after that you go for the
04:11 family and so when all those things come
04:15 together well and maybe you haven't even
04:16 started the family yet
04:19 when it all goes well you're making
04:21 money you live in a great place you have
04:23 gave great friends you have a great
04:25 employer you're real important at your
04:27 job we tend to have this illusion that
04:31 all the circumstances that are making
04:33 our life grand total to this feeling are
04:39 never going to go away you're going to
04:43 keep this status forever and I find that
04:46 folks that are more naive and new to
04:49 this euphoria become the most confident
04:52 and they fall the quickest and the
04:54 fastest and the hardest it's one thing
04:56 to fall when you're Tiger Woods and you
04:58 probably have a hundred million dollars
05:00 to your name if not two or three times
05:02 that amount of money I don't know what
05:03 the guy's worth and then it's one thing
05:06 to fall and find yourself damn near
05:08 homeless so US citizens down here at the
05:13 normal level of humanity experience a
05:16 hell of a lot more than a Tiger Woods
05:20 experiences when the crash occurs in our
05:24 lives right
05:25 however Tiger Woods coming back against
05:30 all of the you know I don't want to say
05:32 world champions but the it is sort of
05:35 world champions that you know golf is as
05:37 a global game for sure but you have the
05:41 best golfers in the world and you're
05:43 supposed to go to one of the most
05:45 prestigious golf courses on planet Earth
05:49 Augusta play the Masters and beat
05:52 everybody now that is something that
05:56 regardless of how rich the guy is or
05:58 poor the man is he has to pull that out
06:00 of his body and soul so hats off to him
06:06 we don't necessarily have to win the
06:08 Masters to rebound but sometimes to get
06:12 back on top it will feel like the
06:16 Masters it will feel daunting it will
06:20 feel like there are a thousand reasons
06:22 why you should give up it will be hard
06:26 they will exhaust your mind in your soul
06:29 but but tomorrow you got to wake up and
06:32 do it again so the first thing I want to
06:36 shout out to people that are listening
06:38 to this video if you're on top right now
06:39 I want you to stop what you're doing I
06:42 want you to write down everything that
06:45 is determining the fact that you're on
06:48 top and I want you to double down and
06:51 make sure that those things are
06:54 protected if you're important that your
06:57 work go in and try to make yourself a
07:00 twice as important if you've had a few
07:04 rough relationships
07:06 both well I'm gonna stick with work for
07:08 a second because that's the first one
07:09 out the door right if you've had some
07:12 rough relationships at work go and amend
07:14 those relationships even if you're on
07:15 top you like screw that guy screw that
07:18 chick whatever go mend that relationship
07:20 because you don't know when those people
07:22 might be over your head they might go to
07:24 your competitor and then your company
07:26 goes under even though they were nobody
07:29 at your company they're the head person
07:31 at the other company and they're gonna
07:32 look over your resume and if you've
07:35 apologized or mended things with them
07:37 you might find yourself welcome at the
07:39 other place where you could go to
07:41 maintain your lifestyle here's another
07:44 big one if you're making a ton of money
07:46 then stop spending it and put a bunch
07:48 away put a bunch away for a rainy day
07:52 get used to spending less simplify your
07:55 life you don't need toys go see my
07:57 episode on needful things simplify your
07:59 life so you get to keep more of your
08:01 money and if you haven't met rich people
08:04 before that's what they do
08:06 the amount of scrutiny I see in guys
08:10 worth a hundred million dollars or more
08:12 on what a valet cost they won't even
08:15 park in Valley the screw that I'm not
08:16 paying for someone to park my car poor
08:19 people like yeah I get to valet it's the
08:20 greatest thing on earth Valley is
08:24 starting to become one of the biggest
08:24 goddamn scams on planet Earth I mean
08:27 they want you to Valley at your grocery
08:29 store they want you to pay for parking
08:31 everywhere you go in the world yeah I'm
08:34 out same town killing the slumlords I
08:37 think America could do with a little
08:38 little data for the valet park owners
08:40 not the valet guys but the people that
08:42 are like oh my parking lights so special
08:44 I gotta make you pay ten twenty thirty
08:46 dollars just to park next to a nightclub
08:48 it's alright to get a buck or two but
08:50 Jesus and these people in LA are insane
08:53 and they just raised the price that
08:54 gouge you and there's no ordinance that
08:56 says they can it's just crazy a free
08:58 market right yeah whatever so if you're
09:01 on top take provisions to stay on top if
09:04 you're very arrogant and very confident
09:07 or both that you can't be touched it's
09:12 your company you're staring at a guy
09:15 that used to deposit half a million
09:17 dollars a month
09:18 you can fall let me tell you man
09:21 we had a recession in 98 2008 completely
09:26 orchestrated and we had Steve Jobs walk
09:29 on stage and say that flash is dead and
09:34 html5 was gonna replace flash what a
09:37 joke right it still hasn't replaced
09:39 flash it's getting better with react and
09:42 a few other technologies but seriously
09:45 flash is nearly dead no one wants to
09:48 develop in it and there's nothing like
09:50 it
09:51 I didn't our online music studios and
09:54 flash okay
09:55 amazing stuff so you can have a weird
09:58 random events occur that take you out of
10:00 the mix the founder of your company
10:02 could die your company could get
10:04 purchased by another company unbeknownst
10:06 to you not your company personally but
10:09 the one you're working for I've had that
10:11 happen as well the people who made turbo
10:15 tax here in America got infiltrated by a
10:18 family that sold it off to a tiny little
10:20 competitor and then a big giant fish
10:23 that used to be a three-man company when
10:24 I first met him Intuit bought that
10:26 little fish no one would have ever
10:29 thought that we invented TurboTax and
10:31 it'll be owned by this bizarre a little
10:33 tiny three-man team that made this
10:34 product called quicken but that's what
10:38 happened enough said
10:40 now of course with the self the other
10:43 thing is that if you if you feel like
10:45 you're healthy stay healthy don't go
10:49 switch and don't say oh I can eat
10:51 whatever I want to eat today because I'm
10:54 so healthy that's the way you lose your
10:56 health if you're unhealthy but you're on
10:58 top of every other category of your life
11:00 then go get healthy because you might
11:03 get a diagnosis that you hate that takes
11:05 you out of this world and you're looking
11:06 around going oh my god I have a
11:07 beautiful job beautiful family and now
11:09 I've got cancer and I'm gonna die or
11:12 something else it's when we get
11:14 confident that we make all these
11:15 mistakes and it's really odd how our
11:19 perception in our enlightenment implodes
11:21 when we become extremely confident with
11:24 our world we lose sight of everything
11:28 that's wonderful
11:31 now let's talk about the crash the fall
11:37 what Tiger Woods he obviously got very
11:41 used to having some female on the side
11:44 even though he was dating the most sorry
11:46 excuse me married to one of the most
11:47 beautiful women have beautiful kids
11:49 he just had something on the side who
11:53 knows where he learned that probably
11:55 from other people who were doing it and
11:58 once you get away with it once you can
12:00 get away with it again and again in your
12:02 brain yeah he probably was I have no
12:05 idea of what I'm saying is true so don't
12:07 attach this to him whatsoever about it I
12:09 could see him having the ability to be
12:13 with a server woman before he gets
12:15 married and then when he gets married
12:18 people might tease him about the one
12:20 you're gonna have one woman they're your
12:22 whole life how could you do that oh no
12:24 way I guess I'll go get some more women
12:26 you know if he gets upside down but no
12:29 one knows that guy's story truly but
12:31 when someone gets upside down they might
12:33 turn to alcohol and drugs to kind of
12:34 take off the edge maybe that was always
12:36 part of the game hidden underneath the
12:38 the you know antithesis of his veneer
12:43 that he was a good guy and kept
12:45 everything straight I think he's a good
12:46 guy but you know everybody can get into
12:50 something you're not supposed to get
12:51 into and as long as you don't fall no
12:54 one notices how many rockers have you
12:57 heard these stories you know where they
12:58 get strung out on heroin but they
13:01 survived and then you find out all the
13:03 guys that took heroin and died but to
13:06 fall how fast can a fall occur hmm I've
13:12 seen it happen damn near overnight the
13:15 friends of mine I have seen it happen
13:17 over a year and the problem is is that
13:22 you get into the situation where it is a
13:24 diminishing return mindset because the
13:29 more unpredicted the moment was the more
13:33 that you find yourself unable to do all
13:37 the things that you did prior to the
13:39 fall there's it's that's to the degree
13:43 it is going to shock
13:44 your system you'll be stunned you may or
13:48 may not have any faculties to deal with
13:50 the moment does he never been there
13:53 before
13:53 you'd never fallen before I had
13:56 mentioned so there was a guy in my
13:58 hometown in the last two years his
14:02 marriage fell apart he was married
14:06 successfully for twenty years and I
14:09 don't really think about his personal
14:10 life or why that occurred he eventually
14:12 was posting on Facebook way too much
14:17 information about his personal life in
14:18 my opinion but he had he had to enjoy 20
14:22 years of a successful marriage which you
14:25 know a lot of people in this day and age
14:27 have never experienced five years of any
14:29 successful marriage so in one realm he
14:32 got really confident in his marriage and
14:34 eventually he started accusing himself
14:36 for about a week or two of having lost
14:40 his appreciation for his wife he didn't
14:43 tell her that he loved her he didn't
14:44 treat her like a queen and it's hard
14:47 it's hard to keep up that kind of
14:49 celebration of someone you're living
14:51 with you know infinitely every single
14:53 day now the people that can do it and do
14:55 it genuinely and not they're not
14:57 kiss-asses they're actually saying you
14:58 know you know you're an amazing person I
15:01 just want you to know that
15:03 timon enough that it hits that heartbeat
15:06 of their need to hear it and your need
15:08 to say it he hold it in - you almost
15:10 can't hold it in anymore what you did
15:13 when you were in your euphoric
15:15 infatuation stage they keep that going
15:18 sometimes that what's that's what makes
15:20 the difference in my own family I've
15:23 seen people with pretty amazing jobs
15:25 some of the best jobs you've ever had in
15:27 their life and I even made a phone call
15:31 at one point that one of my family
15:32 members and I said look the recession is
15:34 coming to your area it is hitting the
15:36 coast right now it's gonna take a couple
15:37 years to get to you so be careful that's
15:40 it be nice don't have any you know don't
15:44 allow any bad blood to exist at your
15:46 company and you know what the person
15:47 said that'll never happen because where
15:51 I live is awesome and that'll never
15:53 happen the person got a new boss
15:57 didn't agree with that boss lipped off
16:00 and got himself fired and since that
16:05 moment and this is 19 years ago 19 18 19
16:10 years ago that person has never had
16:12 steady employment in his life his
16:16 arrogance pure arrogance and a bunch of
16:21 made-up crap about where he lived in his
16:24 own brain was gonna protect him from
16:26 ever losing his job how idiotic was that
16:31 lost it and then when it's really
16:35 difficult to rebound because when you
16:37 fall you naturally just try to rebound
16:41 yeah you know just look for another job
16:43 I'll call my buddies up we'll get
16:45 something rolling it'll be okay and then
16:47 when you do that and you don't get any
16:48 responses and you think an okay well
16:52 maybe my salary requirement is just a
16:54 little too high when you bring your
16:57 salary down you know maybe five thousand
17:01 dollars a year then ten thousand dollars
17:02 even 15 then 20 and you're starting to
17:04 look at your bills and you're looking at
17:06 the salary you're putting online and
17:07 you're like oh my god I don't even if I
17:09 got the job I'd have to take something
17:10 on the side or get rid of my minimum
17:13 quality of life I don't have a lot of
17:16 these experiences personally but I did
17:19 have one right after Electronic Arts in
17:23 2002 actually 2001 they started laying
17:26 off a ton of people I've told you this
17:27 guy's a bunch of stories they had three
17:30 massive layoffs globally and they were
17:32 literally laying off the maximum amount
17:34 of people that the state of California
17:36 but it allowed him to layoff in other
17:38 states they were just slaughtering
17:39 wholesale slaughtering like you know
17:41 3,000 people at one location they had no
17:45 choice the business unit had failed
17:47 because they had trusted to elect a ah
17:49 well to honor their deal and they
17:52 basically lied on their contract why
17:54 would didn't sue my don't know it's
17:55 really strange why we didn't do an
17:57 emergency change I don't understand but
18:00 whatever reason leadership decided to
18:02 fold up the online division and move it
18:05 back into studio meaning accom was its
18:07 own business unit its own CEO and we're
18:09 back underneath
18:11 ei proper so I was a very senior
18:15 director at Electronic Arts before I
18:18 left making a ton of cash I was one of
18:22 the best internet architects probably on
18:26 planet earth at the time knew every
18:29 language that was being used on the
18:32 internet had been sitting in meetings
18:34 for three years on server architecture I
18:37 had taken through so many gigantic mmo's
18:40 onto the servers with obviously experts
18:44 that are helping me am I in that I just
18:47 knew everything I mean I knew everything
18:48 that was there to be known we have by
18:51 2002 you have probably without without
18:54 exaggeration 75 to 80 percent of the
18:57 companies in the world were not online
18:59 so we have a huge market base a huge
19:03 client base to work with and I'm in
19:07 Silicon Valley at the time so I came out
19:10 with a pretty good chunk of change so I
19:12 wasn't worried about paying my bills for
19:14 probably at least a year so and but I'm
19:20 sitting at home I took a month off I
19:22 literally took a month off it had been a
19:24 grueling previous three years I played a
19:28 video game I can't remember what I play
19:29 but I played a couple video games I used
19:31 to like I said I used to review games so
19:33 I always had these betas coming in from
19:34 all the companies and my girlfriend came
19:37 in one night and she's watching me play
19:41 a game and she yelled at me she goes
19:44 what are you doing so what are you
19:46 talking about she goes what are you
19:47 doing playing video games I said look
19:50 I'm just taking a break I literally told
19:52 myself I was gonna take a month off to
19:53 play games just to relax right you know
19:57 what I've been through it was hard for
19:58 both of us for you to be my partner
20:00 while I was going through this you know
20:02 she goes what you better start looking
20:05 for a job because it's hard to find jobs
20:06 out there especially your level you
20:09 better start it was like okay I I told
20:14 her there's a day that it was something
20:17 that was very valuable for me to have
20:19 her do that to me she had never stood up
20:21 to me like that ever
20:22 not that I make it
20:24 any situation where she needs to stand
20:26 up to me for any reason but I really
20:28 appreciated her lucidity and so I went
20:32 online and started looking for work and
20:36 lo and behold no one was replying
20:41 yes Silicon Valley was imploding like
20:43 crazy the recession was hitting
20:45 companies were just disappearing I mean
20:50 it was amazing like I watched
20:51 skyscrapers that were full of out of a
20:54 couple thousand people you could drive
20:56 by him afterwards and you could see
20:58 through the entire building they built
21:00 the building for the company they had so
21:02 much funding so no doubt the industry
21:06 was extremely diluted with you know
21:09 probably really good coders out there
21:11 but my resume was amazing and so I start
21:15 taking down my salary ten thousand
21:18 dollars about every month and a half
21:21 thinking if I were to go on the market
21:24 at say $100,000 a year in Silicon Valley
21:27 of all places and just so you understand
21:30 when I moved from Silicon Valley from a
21:32 three-bedroom apartment into this
21:35 three-bedroom house that apartments
21:38 still right now
21:40 if they hadn't raised it $1 that
21:43 apartments still more expensive than
21:44 this house and that's 16 years ago
21:48 insane in the membrane that place the
21:52 [ __ ] arrogance eppley says to charge
21:54 that much money he's unbelievable but
21:56 anyway I did not have a single bite in
22:01 the Bay Area not one and so what I ended
22:06 up doing because I wasn't going to sit
22:07 there just looking for jobs and playing
22:09 video games as I started drafting up a
22:11 new web platform that I had fantasized
22:14 about for the last two years and created
22:17 it and it worked extremely well and I
22:22 started deploying it to my clients
22:23 because I had some clients on the side
22:25 piddly squat money and it worked great
22:30 able to do all kinds of wild things with
22:32 it and it wasn't geez I didn't get any
22:38 normal work until almost a year and a
22:41 half later and it was like $5,000 here
22:45 $5,000 there I was blowing up my credit
22:48 cards trying to exist my savings got
22:52 destroyed because I was living off of it
22:55 I didn't get to buy a house they get to
22:57 do something I really should have done
22:59 right now had I put away more money when
23:02 I was on top that could have at least
23:06 come out debt-free now when it came time
23:10 to lay off everybody at the company I
23:12 told you skies is you know the story I
23:14 won't repeat the parts that I've already
23:16 said but one of the biggest things that
23:17 happened was that the people at the
23:20 company that sat around all day kissing
23:22 people's asses and doing [ __ ] no work
23:25 whatsoever they were kept on and what
23:29 they found out when they laid all of the
23:31 workers off those of us that didn't pop
23:33 in and give a donut away and just
23:35 [ __ ] about nothing when they laid
23:38 all of us off they found out all they
23:40 had left were the poll [ __ ] who
23:43 couldn't do any code whatsoever couldn't
23:45 organize a project of their life
23:47 depended on it and so eventually one by
23:49 one they got laid off the company went
23:53 literally into a stasis mode because no
23:55 one could do anything for a while I was
23:59 very fortunate that by the end of the
24:01 year 2002 I was able to move back to
24:03 Southern California which is where I
24:05 belong but I did I did some consulting
24:09 did some video games for HBO did some
24:12 other things and eventually I took one
24:14 of my employees from there who also
24:17 moved down to Los Angeles he's on the
24:19 north side of Los Angeles and we formed
24:20 a company together and that's how we
24:22 survived but that didn't start until
24:25 April of 2005 so it was it was scrapping
24:32 time in now part of my personality is
24:36 different than other people's
24:37 personalities and I hope that we're more
24:40 alike than dis dis alike because when I
24:43 get into sort of a bad situation I'm
24:47 very optimistic no matter if there's
24:50 zero indicators that I should be
24:52 that way that's just how I remain and so
24:55 I will bounce through a bad era
24:57 just sort of believing in the universe
25:00 believing in God believing that God
25:01 feeds the birds and he'll feed me
25:03 eventually and miraculously usually now
25:06 when I almost about to run out of money
25:07 or something
25:08 poof the phone rings and something
25:09 happens I get a job I reach out to the
25:12 right person
25:13 take the right interview and I usually
25:15 have a pretty good time but sometimes
25:18 you'll have that job that wife that
25:21 husband Nick the kids everything and for
25:24 whatever reason it's not doing it for
25:27 you it's not them and it's not like you
25:30 want to get get away from them at all
25:32 it's just life itself as a son total
25:35 thing isn't what you wanted it to be and
25:40 so this is where the other episodes are
25:43 extremely handy now the other person
25:46 other episodes are geared towards sort
25:48 of getting sort of surviving these
25:53 situations getting back to the point
25:56 where you're swimming above water you're
25:58 safe and things are good what I'd like
26:02 to do with this episode in honor of
26:04 Tiger Woods is to maybe say let's remind
26:09 yourself each other that greatness is
26:17 attainable at all times it is whatever
26:23 you define greatness to be now too often
26:26 in this up in this show I do you know I
26:29 apologize this way several times and
26:31 episodes I use my world to illustrate
26:36 greatness probably a little too much and
26:40 so I will use music film you know more
26:47 celebrity based pastimes to really give
26:51 you an idea of how far you can go but it
26:54 doesn't have to be anything like that
26:55 whatsoever
26:56 whatever greatness is for you is what it
26:59 is and if yours is unique and yours is
27:03 even less
27:05 perceived as as an amazing thing then
27:09 you're probably dealing with something
27:10 that's easier to attain because everyone
27:12 else is going for this other thing and
27:14 so if your destination of total
27:18 greatness is pretty cool
27:22 stick with it totally stick with it now
27:27 there are things and I've mentioned this
27:29 in the past there are things that you
27:31 may want to strive for that have
27:34 physical limitations sometimes I have
27:39 known several people that have had
27:42 physical moments of greatness
27:46 they were athletes or they were models
27:51 they were competitive you know fitness
27:54 people and so they were able to win
27:58 something at 25 years old and now
28:00 they're heading into 40 maybe they've
28:03 had a couple kids the guys drank too
28:06 many beers and there's this perception
28:08 you can't achieve this physical
28:09 greatness and that there's no group that
28:11 even cares if you did well the world has
28:15 changed doesn't it there's a whole
28:18 fitness trend out there I mean I'm just
28:20 gonna use this as an example because we
28:22 have to address certain things here
28:24 there's a whole Fitness realm out there
28:27 for people in their 40s these moms
28:29 we're like 50 years old and my god you
28:31 know they're better looking than every
28:33 obese social justice warrior is 19 so
28:38 there's a group for everyone and for
28:40 everything you want to get into no you
28:43 can't roll back time and become a 15
28:46 year old person but don't let that stop
28:49 you from finding something in your own
28:51 age range that's really awesome people
28:54 are are changing themselves and
28:56 reinventing themselves all the time and
28:59 part of that game that's really exciting
29:02 is that when is the moment when you
29:05 perceive yourself as being capable of
29:07 being someone different than you are the
29:10 limitations that you perceive sometimes
29:11 they're only the result of you seeing
29:13 yourself as being only capable of being
29:17 one thing
29:19 you know Tiger Woods has a constraint he
29:22 is a pro golfer so his greatness one of
29:26 his greatest things he can do is be the
29:28 best pro golfer because that's what he
29:30 is they can also be the best father in
29:33 the world he screwed up being the best
29:35 husband but that doesn't mean he can't
29:37 get back on top marry someone else would
29:39 be the best husband
29:40 it goes into every level of granularity
29:42 that is our existence you could be a
29:44 really crappy friend crappy son crappy
29:47 daughter to your parents and you just
29:50 turn a new leaf and you're like you know
29:51 what I've been a right piece of you know
29:54 a piece of s and I am going to change
29:58 I'm gonna call my dad call my mom
30:00 whatever apologize for my behavior or
30:04 maybe don't even want to apologize you
30:05 just start being nice and believe me
30:07 your parents don't need an apology half
30:09 the time unless there's some acute
30:10 moment where you were a total jerk and
30:12 you need to address that move on a
30:13 friend of mine two three weeks ago said
30:18 I need to make an extra thousand dollars
30:21 a month I just need to and so she
30:25 started reaching out to other people
30:26 that have little side businesses and
30:28 she's got a few things that she's gonna
30:30 try here's the thing I told her that was
30:34 fantastic and I said you know what the
30:36 real key success of what you've done
30:38 even though you haven't accomplished
30:40 this extra thousand bucks a month is
30:42 that you conceived that you wanted an
30:45 extra thousand dollars a month just the
30:48 pure conception is the first seedling to
30:53 going out and making it real if you
30:56 don't conceive of it could it ever
30:57 happen heck no and so the idea is if you
31:02 have fallen by your own actions or by
31:09 life serving you a really bad you know
31:12 hand of cards and coming up all twos
31:17 well if you like I said in the episode
31:21 you know having a thick skin the idea is
31:25 if you anthropomorphize life and you
31:29 think life is this thing it's got mother
31:31 needs
31:31 father time and also their horseshit let
31:35 me just call it that and it somehow
31:37 these things are acting on you that God
31:39 Himself is going you know it's time for
31:42 you to get those traffic ticket you will
31:45 convince yourself that that is the
31:47 frequency you belong in and through the
31:49 manifest destiny equation of life which
31:53 is extremely real
31:54 you will dial in and attract all that
31:57 negativity to yourself but if you can
32:00 say wait a minute wait a minute this
32:02 isn't the way God works I am the one the
32:07 biggest gifts you're given as you
32:08 control your life you control everything
32:10 around yourself you know didn't-didn't
32:13 then they say in the Bible you can you
32:16 know if a guy wants to move a mountain
32:17 he can it's just the faith that prevents
32:21 you from doing it if you think about it
32:23 I mean there's a bunch of people that
32:25 jumped out of windows
32:26 back in the 50s because I thought they
32:28 watched too many Superman episodes and
32:30 thought they could fly little kids did
32:32 it too so we're not talking about
32:35 exactly that kind of Delta between
32:38 reality and this other vision you might
32:40 have if it's technically impossible I
32:42 don't know maybe you want to be careful
32:44 with that whole thing don't want to test
32:46 your life span doubt with your ideas but
32:49 how many times have you ever heard
32:52 someone say you know I my life had come
32:57 down to this moment
32:58 in fact there's um I know a person who
33:01 sort of bottomed out here in Hollywood
33:04 came here got some gigs you know was
33:06 able to survive still living and kind of
33:08 squabble but it was you know the
33:10 suffering artist sort of thing comedian
33:13 and what she did was she took all of her
33:15 credit cards and said you know what I
33:17 can always bankrupt myself and so she
33:20 traveled the world and filmed everything
33:22 with a bunch of cameras and then came
33:26 back and realized she had enough
33:27 material to make a show she'd cut
33:29 together a pilot and took it to a studio
33:33 and they bought it and she got a job
33:35 being a host of this world traveling
33:38 show
33:40 has she not had the foresight that that
33:43 that could potentially be a future for
33:45 her and had the guts to risk at all Jade
33:48 no kids or anything no husband
33:50 so you risked at all and it all worked
33:53 out part of it is not losing faith in
33:56 yourself I will remind you you are an
34:01 amazing being not just because you're
34:03 homeless sapien sapien not just because
34:06 God created you but because your family
34:10 survives all world history up to the
34:13 point of your birth all of it all of it
34:18 okay we don't even know our own history
34:20 right because it's all been erased and
34:22 revised and a bunch of stuff but they
34:24 survived it all all the plagues all the
34:28 wars all the migration dinosaurs
34:31 whatever right they survived and you are
34:36 the son byproduct of all that DNA so why
34:41 should you lose faith in yourself again
34:42 are you some trivial being only if you
34:47 believe it you know if you're a Democrat
34:50 you should probably change parties and
34:51 start perceiving yourself as actually
34:53 strong instead of weak that needs
34:55 socialistic help one of the other things
34:59 that we wish we had and sometimes it
35:01 doesn't exist and I think most the time
35:03 it does it doesn't exist or even if it
35:06 does exist it has a marginal effect on
35:09 us which is a support team from other
35:11 people someone when it's willing to tell
35:15 you don't worry man it's gonna be okay
35:18 it really is I'm telling you I don't
35:22 even know you and I can tell you it's
35:24 gonna be all right
35:25 but here's the requirement have faith in
35:29 yourself look at your hand you know look
35:33 at it and go wow I am a human being this
35:37 hand is made out of all the DNA that has
35:39 survived all of world history and
35:41 supposedly if you're inclined to have
35:43 lack of faith in yourself supposedly
35:46 you're the first generation that went I
35:48 can't I can't do it
35:53 really because you can you wouldn't
35:58 exist if you didn't have that DNA
35:59 embedded in your system with instincts
36:02 that know how to survive
36:04 yeah do times change and jobs change and
36:07 the kind of knowledge you need to know
36:08 and the complexity of the knowledge you
36:10 need to know change sure but I have guys
36:13 that come to my house all the time to do
36:16 general contractor stuff they take care
36:19 of my plumbing they do amazing things
36:21 they build patios they do all kinds of
36:23 the guys who fixed my cars there's all
36:27 kinds of different levels of complexity
36:28 there I'm sure that whatever you love to
36:31 do there's a job in it because you just
36:35 said the word love if you're going to
36:37 pick out the thing that you love to do
36:39 now sometimes it requires change and
36:42 sometimes change is what we don't want
36:44 to do or afraid of change change was
36:46 what took you from being on top to being
36:48 on bottom in your mind you had some
36:51 money you know how any money at all you
36:52 have no money coming in from anywhere
36:54 you've exhausted your unemployment
36:55 insurance you're just sitting there well
36:59 what's that classic definition of
37:01 insanity doing the same thing expecting
37:03 something different to happen
37:04 mmm and it's probably not the best
37:07 thought you can have but instead of
37:09 viewing it as a permanent scar on your
37:10 intelligence perhaps it's just a
37:13 frequency that invaded your mind and
37:15 it's okay to go through the phases of
37:20 self-doubt only to find yourself in the
37:23 end going you know what screw that I'm
37:26 not gonna let self-doubt have anything
37:27 to do with me hear me roar who's what
37:32 you need to say what's that old saying
37:34 about the devil whispering in your ear
37:36 and say you know just wait till the
37:39 storm comes and you'll be destroyed and
37:41 then you whisper back to the devil
37:43 I am the storm there you go that's the
37:48 attitude you need to have a change of
37:50 paradigm in your mind now does that mean
37:52 that just - changing the paradigm in
37:54 your mind five minutes later is the
37:55 phone gonna ring well it can be that
37:58 quick trust me but no maybe it takes a
38:02 little bit of action on your part it's
38:04 the old blonde joke where the
38:06 keeps asking God to let her win the
38:09 lottery over and over and over she
38:10 praise and praise and praise and then
38:12 finally God leans down inside of her
38:14 room and says buy a ticket right buy the
38:18 ticket
38:18 because she can't without buying the
38:20 ticket that is a metaphor for change
38:23 that person needs to take action in
38:26 order to have a reaction what was the
38:28 story of the Coal Miner's Daughter that
38:31 old story where she is living at a
38:33 fairly repressed world men are the only
38:37 ones that work women are oppressed I
38:39 think she was wasn't the traditional
38:41 story she was married an abusive husband
38:43 or something or at least someone that
38:45 was very chauvinistic and eventually she
38:48 just got tired of that crap and she
38:51 changed but what did she change she just
38:55 changed the inside of her mind and said
38:56 you know I'm not putting up with this
38:58 crap anymore
38:59 I see strong women out there getting
39:00 everything that they want and I'm gonna
39:02 leave and I'm gonna go get that thing
39:04 and that's exactly what she did for most
39:07 people that don't perceive themselves as
39:09 extraordinary you are extraordinary it's
39:15 just a mutant gene you haven't turned on
39:17 again let me always remind you I'm gonna
39:20 do it a couple times in this episode you
39:23 are the survivor of your entire family
39:25 line which is the entire history of the
39:27 world for our species if you didn't have
39:30 it in you your species I mean your
39:33 family line would have disappeared that
39:34 branch just what it ended but it didn't
39:38 when you look back in your family line
39:40 you can typically find several
39:42 successful people
39:43 what would your grandfather do what your
39:44 grandmother do what your
39:45 great-grandfather do what your aunt and
39:47 uncle do what your dad do what your mom
39:48 do what I hear because I'm gonna talk
39:52 more about this this festering moment of
39:55 doubt because we have to extinguish all
39:59 of the misnomers and misclassifications
40:01 of what that really means a lot of times
40:04 people my friends that had brothers and
40:07 sisters there's usually some favoritism
40:09 inside the brother sister Rome maybe
40:13 someone got all the looks maybe
40:15 someone's naturally thin and you're not
40:16 naturally thin or whatever the case
40:18 might be someone's doing really good
40:20 school and you're not doing good at
40:22 school I know a lot of people that don't
40:25 do well in school but they do really
40:26 good in life a lot of people with
40:28 straight A's
40:29 I have to go marry someone just to
40:31 survive just to live off someone else's
40:34 income my hometown is follow people like
40:37 that you're kind of a Seabee students
40:41 well they went off and start their own
40:42 businesses and became millionaires your
40:45 straight-a students struggle to this day
40:48 to survive because it's not a checklist
40:50 you can't just read a book memorize
40:51 something go take a test and life is
40:53 like a bowl of cherries I'll give you an
40:56 analogy that is very true and if you
41:00 study this a little bit online you'll
41:02 find that people agree with me and that
41:04 I poached it off them there's this
41:07 British guy he's Indian and India Indian
41:12 and he is a he's a British guy grew up
41:15 in I think was a Liverpool or something
41:20 like that on a really tough neighborhood
41:23 just outside of London and it was rough
41:27 where he lived it was rough I've got
41:29 another friend of mine who grew up in
41:30 Dublin same exact story but one of the
41:34 is so this Indian guy he teaches
41:37 fighting Street fighting to survive real
41:42 fighting not the crap you learn in
41:43 school or whatever you know when you get
41:45 in attacked it never happens that way I
41:48 had a friend of mine a fairly
41:50 intelligent person I thought I was
41:53 posting some fighting video the other
41:55 day and it was just the most ridiculous
41:57 attack he was like a guy grabbing a
41:59 girl's shoulder that's all I did was
42:01 grab the girl's shoulder and she had
42:02 this move they just knocked his I was
42:04 like really you think anybody attacks
42:06 you like that what are you crazy and
42:08 she's like yeah this is the way to do it
42:09 like that's the way you're gonna be a
42:11 statistic lady but one of the number one
42:15 things when you're in a fight is you
42:19 know you're not if you can escape the
42:20 fight that's what they'll always tell
42:22 you run away if you can I know it
42:23 doesn't sound like a Hollywood movie but
42:25 your life is a precious thing and if you
42:27 lose it you lose it right but if you're
42:30 gonna fight without severe weapons
42:33 but even if you are I mean you only have
42:36 a choice they're gonna probably shoot
42:38 you if you run away see miles will get
42:39 in there and make it happen one of the
42:42 things they said is you know do not
42:43 cower down the second you cower down in
42:46 a fight turn your back crawl into a ball
42:47 roll into a ball or whatever well you're
42:51 certainly assuring your complete
42:53 destruction to the degree that person
42:55 wants to destroy you whatever whatever
42:57 bar they've set it out I'm gonna kill
42:59 this person I'm gonna maim this person
43:01 some people are so stupid when they
43:02 fight they go to these death moves or
43:04 kicking people in the heads all the
43:06 stupid crap not realizing they're you
43:08 know right on the precipice of murder
43:10 and then they want to cry in court when
43:11 they get a life since [ __ ] those people
43:13 right but one of the things you never
43:16 want to do is back down you get into it
43:18 and a lot of times a bully has never had
43:21 anyone come out them so they start the
43:25 fight and they're just they're just in
43:27 their mind they're their pavlo nian Li
43:29 trained okay I'm gonna swing they're
43:31 gonna get hit and then they're gonna
43:32 cower down they're gonna run and all
43:34 their moves all of their mechanisms to
43:37 dominate the fight is based on someone
43:39 turning into a coward but the very first
43:42 time someone fights back they have
43:45 nothing in their playbook at all they're
43:48 not used to getting clocked in there in
43:51 their throat in their chin and they're
43:53 from those and their eyes they just have
43:55 no experience never been kicked in the
43:58 balls I read their knees popped out you
44:02 know their gut punched really hard a
44:04 little bit of training could make you
44:07 completely save your own life I studied
44:11 some martial arts in the Bay Area I was
44:13 don't laugh but it was kung fu and it
44:16 was Eagle Claw confu and it was this
44:21 obviously an Asian guy was teaching it
44:23 he might have been five eight five seven
44:27 probably a buck 10 he was the master and
44:31 of course there's mixed martial arts and
44:33 all this other stuff that's now really
44:35 lethal the greasy jujitsu kind of stuff
44:37 you know there's some guys running
44:39 around at bars with all that knowledge
44:41 and they're just you know Neanderthals
44:43 trying to
44:44 prove to their infant s amol egos inside
44:47 that they're still strong and they're
44:49 still powerful you know hopefully none
44:51 of you are hanging around those places
44:52 at that time of day to get into those
44:54 kind of situations and hopefully none of
44:56 you ever experienced it I'm telling you
44:57 this because we're gonna switch this
44:58 over to a mental thing because the
45:01 kung-fu thing was all mental but there's
45:04 two things this guy taught me in the
45:06 class form that I thought was utterly
45:07 brilliant one he boiled down every
45:10 single attack you could possibly do and
45:11 he said look stop trying to learn these
45:14 Taekwondo things and this other you know
45:17 any any art of fighting that has like
45:20 hundreds of options he says because when
45:22 you're in a fight you don't want to be
45:25 unless you're absolute master of
45:27 fighting and you do it every single day
45:29 and you teach it you're not gonna be
45:30 able to recall okay what's the best
45:32 punch for here and there they want you
45:35 to go for throat knees and eyes but in
45:41 that order usually a fact it could be
45:43 knees first to draw the person down but
45:45 the throat is the automatic thing that
45:47 once you get socked in the throat using
45:49 the web in your hand here you just jab
45:51 someone and throat you will stun them in
45:54 a way they've never been stung before
45:55 because they will physically have a
45:57 problem breathing and if you want to get
45:59 really nasty you you grab the items up
46:01 and connect your fingers on the other
46:02 side and they have about 15 minutes to
46:04 air left before they're gonna swell up
46:06 and probably die if they don't get a
46:07 tracheotomy but you can sleep a knee
46:09 push a kneecap from the inside out super
46:12 fast bring them down to your level if
46:14 they're really tall and you know some
46:16 guys know that this is an area and
46:18 they'll do whatever they can to cover it
46:20 up if there's some serial rapist or
46:22 something
46:23 but what you're trying to do is escape
46:24 you want to strike and escape that's
46:26 this whole tactic but one thing he did
46:28 and I mentioned it a long time ago and
46:30 season one I believe but he had some
46:34 pretty normal sized females maybe
46:38 between 110 120 pounds and he said you
46:43 know he picked a woman he said do you
46:45 have kids and she said no and he goes
46:47 would you have any sisters that have
46:49 kids you have nephews and niece oh yeah
46:50 totally got babies and stuffing so she
46:52 goes he goes okay I can't remember if he
46:55 did this first or second if you ask the
46:57 question afterward
46:58 but he had a big guy come after her and
47:00 it was a big dude and she just crumbled
47:03 really fast didn't know what to do and
47:06 it was it was intended to be like that
47:08 second thing he said was he walked up to
47:10 her and he asked her the questions about
47:11 the the baby thing maybe that was
47:14 definitely afterwards but anyway he said
47:15 I want you to imagine take a minute take
47:18 five minutes if you need to and imagine
47:21 these children around you and he said
47:26 now the person coming after you doesn't
47:29 really care about you he wants to steal
47:32 your kids because he's gonna go do
47:34 really bad things to them and now what
47:38 is your resolve to get rid of his body
47:41 out of this world and you watch this
47:45 woman just transform and he changed her
47:49 mind he gave her a reference point that
47:51 she used to defend these children and
47:54 boy did she rise to the occasion and
47:58 what he also taught us was that just so
48:01 you know kung fu was designed for a
48:05 weaponless fighting because there was a
48:07 he was telling us this point in history
48:08 I wish I'd remembered everything he said
48:10 but he said there was a point in history
48:12 where in China you weren't allowed to
48:15 have weapons of any kind because they
48:17 wanted the people to be disarmed and the
48:19 soldiers to be ironed this is I think
48:20 before necessarily there was guns or
48:23 anything but you know swords and that
48:25 kind of stuff and so they had to be able
48:27 to quietly totally take someone out to
48:29 be able to take someone out quickly and
48:31 they said that the whole form of
48:32 fighting in kung-fu was that so a
48:34 seven-year-old and a 70 year old could
48:40 take out anybody with 7 pounds of
48:43 pressure it was the other thing he said
48:44 so that little reservoir on your throat
48:46 your Adam's apple your knee you really
48:49 don't need a hell of a lot of pressure
48:50 to push the knee completely out of whack
48:52 now the fun things about knees is you
48:54 can knock them completely out and they
48:56 can just push their knee back eventually
48:57 but they won't be chasing you that night
48:59 guarantee you and then we'll be
49:00 breathing right if you happen to mess up
49:02 their neck and one of his star students
49:04 was a woman who defended herself against
49:08 a serial rapist in San Francisco that
49:10 was crawling through
49:11 windows using catwalks and he would
49:14 catch a woman taking a shower and she
49:17 had just taken enough of his course to
49:18 do the neck job and he pulled this like
49:21 just like a Alfred Hitchcock movie he
49:23 pulled the the shower curtain Oh apart
49:29 or baby was standing there and she
49:31 pulled it apart or whatever but she's
49:32 standing right in front of this dude
49:33 she's naked and wet I mean you can't be
49:36 more vulnerable than naked and what and
49:38 he's standing there I don't think any
49:40 weapons but she jabbed him right in the
49:42 throat took him right down to his knees
49:44 ran out the door with her towel and
49:46 started screaming to the neighbors and
49:48 they went in they finally caught the guy
49:50 pretty awesome right so I tell this
49:54 physical martial arts story in an
49:57 episode about rebounding for a really
50:01 bad situation at some point in your life
50:06 you will get pushed around so much that
50:08 you're not gonna take it anymore
50:10 it's like the movie Network I'm mad as
50:12 hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore I
50:14 think in America were pretty disgusted
50:16 with the super PAC extreme left telling
50:20 us how our life is going to be
50:21 completely immoral we're gonna be
50:23 killing children revaccinated our kids
50:25 we're sick and tired of it absolutely
50:28 sick and tired of it and so we're making
50:32 mental changes we're fighting back it's
50:35 a slow process but we're getting there
50:36 but when it comes to your personal life
50:39 and your personal happiness I want you
50:42 to envision the fact that you've just
50:43 had enough of losing of letting life
50:48 control you I used to give this analogy
50:50 in the first couple seasons where you
50:51 know you don't want to be the pinball in
50:53 the pinball game where you're being
50:57 knocked around by the flippers the
50:58 bumpers the kickers you're being ejected
51:02 every morning by a little pull stop
51:04 you're being completely controlled by
51:06 life I think it's in the movie air sorry
51:09 it's in the song by Ozzy Osbourne crazy
51:13 trains he says I watched all the
51:16 dropouts write their own rules and what
51:19 a great line that is and what is he
51:21 saying he's saying those C and D
51:23 students
51:25 they lived free they wrote their own
51:29 rules again when you hang out and smoke
51:31 lounges are like two o'clock in the
51:33 afternoon because you're self-employed
51:34 that was those are the people that you
51:36 meet people who said you know it I've
51:39 made my own company where I became my
51:42 own you know I'm a consultant so I run
51:44 my own world but I was as I was a slave
51:47 to a corporation at some point any
51:50 corporations can be good they can have
51:51 great health benefits 401k plans
51:54 vacation all that good stuff you just
51:58 got to find them then find your position
52:00 and then to make yourself significant I
52:03 told the story a couple times maybe this
52:06 is a good time to tell it because it
52:08 wasn't necessarily about me I'm actually
52:11 sorry it is actually a moment when I got
52:14 laid off from the very first time I'm 19
52:17 years old I'm in California I got no
52:18 family out here no savings whatsoever I
52:21 get laid off on a Tuesday morning no
52:25 idea this is coming I'm a star employee
52:27 but the company had lost over a million
52:30 dollars in 1989 that was a tremendous
52:32 amount of money and a bunch of us were
52:35 getting laid off a bunch of the old
52:36 guard we're getting let go and so this
52:41 is when I found my buddy gave me the
52:43 little ad from the recycler about
52:45 becoming a video game artist and he said
52:47 you should go do this man you draw all
52:49 the time you paint you do whatever and
52:50 so I went and get the interview and got
52:54 the job like right away
52:57 two days later I was literally employed
52:59 from this video game company and just
53:01 loved in life but now if someone had
53:04 told me to think about the math of this
53:06 okay and this is you I woke up on a
53:09 Tuesday morning April 15th maybe it was
53:14 April 16th I can't remember 1989 go look
53:17 up April 16th wrote it but that would
53:18 have been the day I get laid off do you
53:24 think I had in my mind
53:25 oh no problem two days later I'm gonna
53:28 be a video game artist something I had
53:30 been since I was 11 but only in my
53:33 personal time not a
53:37 I don't know not in a million years I
53:40 mean maybe a million years I would have
53:41 said yeah probably a video game artist
53:42 right for some reason I didn't come in
53:44 California and seek the thing that I was
53:46 doing in the Midwest stupid of me it's
53:49 another thing about setting your goals
53:50 high because you get your goals you're
53:52 really bored to death of everything but
53:55 two days later because it took me a day
53:58 to go get the interview literally it was
54:00 like I think it was a Tuesday
54:03 we hung out that day and I got this ad I
54:07 made the phone call got the interview
54:09 went to the interview answered all the
54:11 questions the guy gave me a computer and
54:13 the disk and said take this home and
54:14 draw bring back the disk and if we need
54:17 you to bring out the computer we will so
54:19 I bring back the floppy disk got drawn
54:20 all evening got hired well the day I get
54:25 hired I mean I a really funny story
54:27 about that too but I get her and I'm
54:30 sitting in the in this beach house in
54:32 Oxnard California which was their
54:33 company on the beach we played in this
54:36 really cool Tron frisbee that was all
54:39 lit up it was super cool and I ended up
54:42 eating tacos from Taco Bell before they
54:44 got bought out by Pepsi was really
54:46 delicious back in the day and I'm eating
54:48 tacos and I'm drawing the company logo
54:50 they're assigning me my assignment and
54:54 life was good there's some of you that
54:58 will have that experience but now what
55:01 if I you know sucked so much and and
55:04 really got into man I'm never going to
55:07 get this or whatever maybe I would have
55:08 exude that in the interview and they
55:10 would have been man you're probably
55:11 pretty talented but I don't want to be
55:13 around your frequency and it may not
55:15 even be conscious that may just be like
55:16 something wrong with that guy
55:18 so I'm going into the story because I
55:21 want to make sure I don't demonize
55:23 things that could be really great for
55:24 you and one of them is working for
55:25 corporations that are decent this was a
55:28 small company small companies are the
55:30 best man so I bring in my first gig and
55:34 I was one of the first guys to complete
55:36 one of the realm art packages and this
55:38 was drawing the world in tile form it's
55:41 an old-school thing before we had 3d and
55:44 the CEO was showing off my artwork and
55:48 bragging that I had finished my first
55:51 gig
55:51 in about a month and he was kind of
55:55 breaking the other employees over the
55:56 coal saying man you guys have been here
55:58 a lot longer and you're not done with
55:59 anything so step up to the plate man
56:04 which was embarrassing for me but I've
56:08 shared this in a different context I
56:09 shared the exact same story any
56:10 different context I'm gonna give you the
56:11 other context of the situation but I sat
56:13 down with the best artist in the company
56:15 who was his kid had a whole history of
56:18 creating amazing freakin art he created
56:21 a a putt-putt golf game but instead of
56:24 having to be the traditional you know
56:27 miniaturised
56:28 Golf Course thing he I don't know who
56:31 designed the game but it was like
56:33 bathrooms and stuff and so you were
56:35 putting off of toilet seats and sinks
56:38 and kitchen tables and it wasn't
56:40 anything it was like it was like a
56:42 miniature game inside your house it was
56:44 utterly brilliant but he sat me down
56:46 because he turned in the next package
56:48 which was this beautiful castle was
56:51 unbelievably gorgeous but he sat me down
56:54 and without bragging he just showed me
56:57 how amazing he was and he wasn't
57:00 bragging about anything and I'm looking
57:01 at almost photo real you know sketch art
57:04 in a computer and I'm thinking geez this
57:06 guy's something else so what did I do
57:08 I went home utterly inspired to up my
57:12 game two or three steps before I bring
57:14 in another piece of art which I think I
57:17 succeeded in doing I they also gave me
57:19 the the job of drawing all the splash
57:21 screens to the games because they like
57:25 the way I do it your perception of
57:28 yourself is key to the rebound
57:32 Tiger Woods had to have said to himself
57:35 I think I can do this I'm pretty sure I
57:39 can do this
57:40 right it goes in that stage I'm pretty
57:42 sure I can and then oh yeah you know he
57:45 it's a few he golf's somewhere maybe he
57:48 does Augusta just as a practice run he
57:52 slams it in at some amazingly low score
57:55 and he's like man I think I got it I got
57:57 my mojo back and then of course he shows
58:00 up for the competition and proves it to
58:02 the entire world
58:04 you know I don't dislike golf but I'm
58:06 not a huge golf follower when I'm around
58:10 people that golf I can get back into it
58:12 and understand where the competition is
58:14 and where the game is but I tell you
58:16 what seeing Tiger Woods do it that's
58:19 extremely inspiring to me I saw Mike
58:23 Tyson on YouTube throw like four or five
58:26 punches in a bar the other day and I
58:27 thought well Mike's got it back too but
58:31 I'm sure he'll never get in the ring
58:32 again the only George Foreman does that
58:34 I think he's a contender you say you
58:37 know it's like crazy so now let me ask
58:41 you this before we close out raise your
58:45 hand if you are one of the people that
58:46 has gone through this once before you're
58:49 on top then you on bottom then you're on
58:52 top again how did you treat being back
58:56 on top a second time were you more
58:59 careful were you more appreciative did
59:02 you spend less money and save more
59:04 did you work those relationships a
59:06 little bit better are you less cocky
59:08 less arrogance did you come in stronger
59:12 you know you studied more you learned
59:15 your art better it depends on what age
59:20 you are but I would say if you're 40
59:23 years old in America you've probably
59:25 gone through at least once why because
59:28 they used to orchestrate these crashes
59:30 they're trying to do it to the Donald
59:34 Trump again in 2019 they want to crash a
59:35 bunch of stock or stock markets they
59:37 want to crash a bunch of real estate
59:39 again someone just published an article
59:41 ten cities they're gonna experience a
59:43 major collapse in real estate and I
59:45 looked at all ten of them in there
59:47 fairly remote cities other than maybe
59:49 Cleveland Ohio but what a crappy thing
59:51 to do there's so many conspiracy
59:55 channels that are selling dune products
59:58 unbelievable unbelievable doom and
60:02 especially an economic sense is all the
60:04 perception of the people so all these
60:06 these big conspiracy channels that are
60:11 trying to help you out they're selling
60:12 you doom in the first two minutes
60:14 because they want to sell you
60:17 flashlights they want to sell you virus
60:21 protection they want to sell you some
60:23 get rich fast scheme or or how to
60:26 survive during the apocalypse kind of
60:28 thing it's like about how about we just
60:30 prevent the apocalypse from happening
60:31 how about that little idea how about
60:34 stop telling people that a collapse is
60:36 going to occur so this rumor both of
60:38 nothing but a bunch of naysayers
60:41 circulates the world and then we have
60:43 something where people got not buying a
60:44 house now because you know I have the
60:46 money and I want one and I need one but
60:48 I'm not gonna do it because I heard on
60:49 this channel that something's Bad's
60:52 gonna occur unreal don't believe the
60:56 hype don't buy into that crap if it
61:00 happens let it happen but you just need
61:02 to hunker down no matter what everyone
61:05 to get out of the depression hunker down
61:07 for the rest of their lives they did
61:11 saving money wasn't painful at all
61:13 saving money was like I know what it
61:16 feels like to have nothing I know what
61:18 it's like to see my fellow citizens
61:19 hurting badly he realized that you know
61:23 during the Depression the reported
61:25 unemployment was like 36% some people
61:29 think it was way higher it usually
61:31 always is a lot higher that's a problem
61:34 they learned their lesson and they I
61:39 think in large part never experienced
61:41 anything like that again
61:43 so not to repeat myself terribly badly
61:46 for my other episode but what kind of
61:48 Falls do we have I think the most common
61:52 fall that we have today is actually
61:56 probably relationship Falls because they
61:59 are irrespective of the economy
62:02 something goes south in your
62:03 relationship
62:06 well sometimes those things are going to
62:09 occur irrespective of anything that you
62:11 do sometimes the more you try the more
62:14 they end up occurring and it's not
62:16 because you're being a naysayer in your
62:17 own life and you're dialed into a
62:19 negative frequency sometimes the other
62:20 person is sometimes you can make it
62:24 better sometimes you can't make it
62:27 better
62:29 what I find to be very soothing in the
62:34 end is to get closure with the event
62:38 that occurred in a relationship so
62:40 something goes south you simply need to
62:41 go
62:42 you know what no matter what I would
62:44 have done that would have occurred
62:46 anyway like I said in my alcoholism
62:49 episode I've dated of at least probably
62:56 three if not maybe for one person
62:59 corrected it completely but at least
63:02 three people that are alcoholics
63:05 unbelievably great people beautiful
63:08 people but they struggle and they're
63:11 unable to conquer it they may die of it
63:14 who knows they may lose all of their
63:17 fortune in life they may be rich but
63:21 they may never have a good time
63:22 or have less good times and bad times I
63:25 mean let's yeah that's bad times let's
63:27 good times the bad times yeah so that's
63:29 pretty organic if you can play it
63:34 forward a little bit in your mind and go
63:35 well I really wanted that to work my
63:39 perception of them was I wanted them not
63:40 to be that kind of person but they
63:42 really are committed to being that kind
63:43 of person then you know the thing that
63:47 hurts in relationships when they go
63:49 south is is having this vision in your
63:51 head of what they are but they're not
63:52 that person and so you think oh my god
63:54 I'm losing the best person in the whole
63:56 world and you know that does occur well
63:59 they're not alcoholic there's there's
64:00 perfectly fine they just don't choose
64:01 you maybe you changed maybe you guys
64:05 grew apart things happen now more than
64:09 ever there's a million ways to find
64:10 another person there is there's so many
64:13 dating sites out there it's crazy people
64:15 with the exact same experience that
64:17 you've had they're just like you
64:20 remember it doesn't matter what you guys
64:22 eat and drink and watch movies and that
64:25 all that likeness that's good you want
64:27 that but the number one thing that makes
64:29 you compatible is your theme in life why
64:32 do you exist what do you live for as
64:35 long as that is similar you're gonna
64:38 have a good time so never forget that
64:41 when I was 17 years old I challenged my
64:43 mother my soon-to-be stepfather with a
64:47 piece of paper I got this from prints
64:49 but I used it on them and under the
64:52 cherry moon there's a funny scene when
64:56 they're out by this racetrack in the
64:58 South of France and she says something
65:03 like do you love me and he says define
65:06 love and they start making out and so I
65:12 gave him these paper notes that I want
65:13 both of you to sit away from each other
65:15 this bench seat in their apartment in
65:17 their kitchen and I said define love on
65:20 a piece of paper go for it and they they
65:22 were like whoa [ __ ] it was like they
65:25 were a little worried you know and they
65:26 wrote down I don't know maybe like 10
65:28 words and they only had one word between
65:30 the two of them that was the same but
65:32 the synonyms of all the other words were
65:35 pretty compatible and I think they
65:37 thought about it and they were married
65:39 to this day so it worked out because
65:43 they found out that they live for the
65:44 same thing now sometimes we lose people
65:48 because of illness and we lose them way
65:51 before they should ever be gone and
65:54 there's a listener out there I don't
65:56 know if he listens to the show anymore
65:58 but he did and I think was during the
66:01 MKULTRA days but he reached out to me on
66:05 skype I've told the story once before to
66:07 make it really quick his wife had passed
66:09 his wife was sick and then I tucked him
66:11 all the way through it first couple
66:12 months through three months and I was a
66:15 heart-wrenching situation he had two
66:16 kids and and she just was ill a couple
66:19 different things and she eventually
66:21 passed and I told him before she passed
66:23 I said look if she does go because we
66:26 weren't sure I said she might take care
66:29 of you from the other side she might
66:32 find you the perfect mate on the other
66:35 side and of course he's kind of stunned
66:38 and he's like I you know that sounds
66:40 great we'll see and he lives in Oregon
66:47 she passed it was rough you know he had
66:50 several sessions after that and you know
66:53 I just my heart went off is such a great
66:55 man he was such a just a great guy any
66:59 one of you would be honored to call him
67:01 your friend trust me but sure enough I
67:05 can't remember how they met if they met
67:07 online or something
67:08 scroll lives in Kansas of all the places
67:10 right here I am from Kansas right but he
67:13 meets the most stunning woman and they
67:18 are together to this day and it happened
67:20 I think gosh I feel like it was within
67:23 six months boom
67:27 it's like something angelic occurred and
67:32 I see his posts all the time with
67:34 Facebook and he's just happy as can be
67:35 just no complaints man sometimes that
67:40 can happen too I always think bond Scott
67:43 took care of ac/dc guy was it Brian
67:47 Brian Johnson excuse me
67:49 and then they what do they do they
67:51 created back in black the this the album
67:55 that stayed on the top 100 billboards
67:58 until 2014 it releases in 1980 it stays
68:03 on there but 34 years in the top 100
68:08 unbelievable and it still comes back on
68:10 every once in a while to a consecutively
68:13 for 34 years so have faith in the
68:17 universe is a spiritual entity and and I
68:20 want to remind you that God feeds the
68:23 birds right he feeds the birds he feeds
68:25 the fish she takes care of everything on
68:27 this planet and he takes care of you too
68:31 just don't be naive and deny him the
68:34 capability of doing that have faith is
68:37 something wonderful will happen and hey
68:39 if you happen to go through some really
68:42 rough patches just before that happens
68:44 just think about it when you do rebound
68:47 into greatness you're going to
68:51 appreciate it so much more I just had a
68:54 call from a friend of mine loved her
68:56 dearly under different circumstances I'd
68:59 marry her she went through a really
69:01 tough spell I met her on top of the
69:04 world went to her unbelievably gorgeous
69:07 house had amazing
69:09 first I don't know six-hour session with
69:11 this girl we just became extremely good
69:14 friends we have Tesla in common and then
69:17 she told me I think after it occurred
69:20 that she had become homeless at one
69:22 point this is an amazingly brilliant
69:25 beautiful girl she was homeless she had
69:29 lost all this weight I don't think a lot
69:32 of us do cuz she had lost her cell phone
69:34 because she couldn't afford to pay for
69:35 it she wasn't able to contact us she
69:37 wasn't able to say come pick me up but
69:40 now she lives in a wonderful city she
69:46 loves her job she's appreciated by tons
69:48 of people I think she's dating someone
69:52 amazing I mean she rebounded and I just
69:56 talked to her was it two days ago and I
70:00 just I I told her I said remember when
70:02 we were going through you were going
70:04 through all that other stuff and I
70:05 finally figured out you gone through
70:06 that spell and she still had about a
70:08 year of things to fix in her life and
70:12 she did it
70:14 she did every single thing she needed to
70:16 do she was on top of the she's on top of
70:18 the world right now
70:18 she's appreciating life it's awesome set
70:24 your goals high because you just might
70:26 get them and you know I've said it a
70:30 long time ago I haven't said this in
70:32 hundred episodes at least so here we go
70:34 again when you hear celebrities
70:38 interviewed about their life about their
70:41 goals how they get there what was their
70:43 secret sauce they always say the same
70:46 thing in different words a lot of times
70:48 use the exact same words they said
70:51 follow your dreams and never stop until
70:55 you get them that sounds like something
70:59 that a privileged person says right
71:01 pretty people say that and not true I
71:05 mean it ain't sure that they're the only
71:07 people that say it and it's not true
71:09 that it only works for pretty people and
71:11 also their crap it's absolutely
71:14 positively true set your goals high and
71:19 again forget all the celebrity crap I
71:21 always mention
71:22 you could just want to be with someone
71:24 wonderful you could want to have a
71:27 particular trade skill job something if
71:32 anyone else in this entire planet gets
71:34 paid to do which you want to do then you
71:37 could be that person too you may have to
71:40 sell it within your neighborhood maybe
71:42 you're in a more rural district of the
71:44 world and no one is aware of that
71:46 particular job being useful or maybe you
71:49 need to move or that job is really
71:50 useful you know one of my pet things
71:57 it'll never happen in my lifetime I
71:58 don't think but I'm supposed to meet a
72:01 um a fairly famous archaeologist here
72:05 shortly
72:06 part of a part of another venture that
72:09 I'm sort of incubating into but being
72:12 you know I don't want be an
72:14 archaeologist anywhere in the world of
72:15 course but you know you gotta pay your
72:17 dues and do what you got to do but it
72:18 would be interesting and maybe my 50s or
72:20 something to have enough money to get my
72:23 bills paid and then go on a little
72:28 six-month volunteer situation where I
72:31 could maybe have to take some classes
72:33 and some courses but I'm willing to bet
72:35 that if you just show up they can give
72:38 you a couple real remedial tasks maybe
72:41 you know gritting off an area and then
72:45 doing some real tender you know digging
72:48 or something we're looking for this
72:49 we're looking for that you put this here
72:51 put that there and I'm pretty sure we
72:52 could learn it on the spot but that's
72:55 something I think would be really cool
72:56 to do digging up history and there's no
72:59 propaganda around me Stalin to me it's
73:00 one way or the other I'm right there
73:02 looking at it making my own deductions
73:04 helping the process out you can be
73:07 anything that you can conceive yourself
73:09 being you know if you're a four foot
73:12 nine girl yeah you probably won't be in
73:16 the male NFL no matter how much you
73:18 identify as a male I don't know if you
73:20 can pull it off
73:21 good luck if you can don't get hurt okay
73:23 but there's just it seems like there's
73:27 an infinite level of things you can be
73:30 perhaps things you've already been
73:32 perhaps things you've never been but
73:34 things that you have a good
73:35 knowledgebase on and you can get into it
73:39 that's your rebound path I have an
73:43 episode called reinventing yourself and
73:45 that's really an episode about life is
73:47 good and why not make it better well
73:51 watch that episode and then just apply
73:53 it to your rebound strategy get excited
73:57 about your rebound strategy because you
73:59 know why you get to design it it doesn't
74:03 matter if anyone may say is it hell if
74:05 you got people around you that are gonna
74:06 naysay your rebound strategy the don't
74:09 share it make it your own little secret
74:12 get yourself a little notebook well
74:15 those little tiny ones that are
74:16 leather-bound and they have no writing
74:19 in them and just start filling that
74:21 thing up with everything there's
74:24 something called an image board which a
74:27 lot of businesses use to capture the
74:29 overall look of an interior design or
74:31 architecture or some something like that
74:33 but image boards are also used and a lot
74:37 of you have used them and you've done
74:38 this before but you cut out pictures you
74:40 print out things from your computer it's
74:43 very important to make this analogue you
74:46 can put it as your desktop on your
74:47 computer as well but it's much better to
74:49 have it analog on your wall somewhere
74:52 fill up a whole wall with every picture
74:55 of everything that you want to
74:57 accomplish in your life whether it be
74:59 possessions or a career a place you want
75:04 to live at least say you want to live in
75:05 Hawaii well cut out pictures of places
75:08 you want to live in Hawaii
75:09 do some research throw down some google
75:13 dudes on the streets and take snapshots
75:15 of houses you might want to aspire to
75:17 own or live in or rent or whatever if
75:21 you want to be in Hollywood well print
75:23 out pictures of sound stages and back
75:27 Lots and sets and whatever whatever it
75:31 is you want to do fill your mind and
75:33 your soul in your spirit with the
75:34 frequency of what you want and you'll be
75:37 really surprised how nature just just
75:40 takes you there but if you don't like my
75:43 friend wanted to make an extra thousand
75:44 bucks without her conceiving of that
75:46 need and
75:47 want it was never gonna happen the
75:50 second she conceived of it I'm gonna
75:52 tell you if if it was gonna be if we say
75:57 the difficulty level was gonna be a
75:58 level 10 to get $1,000 a month and she
76:02 conceives of it she immediately reduces
76:05 that difficulty to a 5 out of 10 and the
76:08 minute she starts taking steps making
76:10 phone calls looking up things on the
76:11 internet trying things becomes a four
76:14 becomes a three becomes a two and
76:15 eventually becomes a zero and she gets
76:17 her thousand dollars a month and I
76:19 wouldn't be surprised if she could make
76:20 two or three thousand dollars a month
76:23 now let's parse the Tiger Woods thing
76:26 just a little bit here so that you can
76:28 kind of perceive yourself in his camp
76:30 what did Tiger do technically speaking
76:34 he played a golf game while by himself
76:37 and got the best score that he's
76:40 probably ever had at that course or
76:43 close to it or whatever I don't know his
76:45 whole score in statistics that I'm
76:46 following that crap but technically
76:48 speaking he played a game by himself
76:51 with himself
76:53 and got the best score of all the other
76:56 people but now does he trade swings with
77:00 somebody else no does he trade balls
77:03 with somebody else no he is playing a
77:07 game all by himself and then because
77:11 it's a game at a the most prestigious
77:14 Golf Club in our country club in the
77:18 entire United States Augusta is so
77:21 prestigious okay I think it cost half a
77:24 million dollars to get in at least it
77:27 did of 10-15 years ago it's on TV so he
77:33 goes and does this thing it's on TV
77:34 and then we watch it and it's this thing
77:36 around the world I think Trump's gonna
77:37 give him some medal for doing it so
77:40 what's the difference between Tiger and
77:42 you okay so let's say that you do
77:47 something in your life and you do it by
77:49 yourself and it's the best you've ever
77:51 done it but nobody knows you're doing it
77:53 there's not a TV crew on you you're not
77:55 doing it at a famous place well what
77:58 does that have to do with Tiger
77:59 accomplishing what he accomplished he
78:02 accomplished it all by himself with
78:04 himself by himself it just so happens
78:07 that other people cared and so it's on
78:10 TV and he gets famous and it's all over
78:12 national news and people were impressed
78:13 people know that it happened all right
78:17 that's an ancillary benefit to what he
78:19 did not what he did what he did was all
78:22 by himself hmm
78:26 him sinking that last ball in the 18th
78:28 hole did a child get fed because of that
78:33 only if he donates his proceeds did he
78:38 save someone's life out of a burning
78:39 building no did he release a piece of
78:42 software that changed the world no did
78:45 he write a piece of music that will make
78:46 lovers find each other
78:50 no what he did was a completely isolated
78:54 event that people cared about and simply
78:56 filmed and put on the news I am going to
78:59 suggest that every single person
79:01 listening to my voice can blow that
79:02 accomplishment away with half the effort
79:06 you can touch the world with half the
79:10 effort you can make a difference in a
79:13 child's life in your lover's life in
79:15 your own life you could be holding
79:17 someone's hand that would have died by
79:19 themselves and you assure them out of
79:21 this world
79:22 way more impressive than playing a golf
79:26 game again the lowest score among other
79:28 players so before you think that Fame is
79:31 where you need to be I don't know it's
79:34 not a bad thing
79:35 but I'm willing to bet you could do a
79:37 lot better with a normal thing quote
79:39 unquote so when I say rebound to
79:42 greatness
79:43 it's your definition it's your
79:45 proprietary formula of greatness if you
79:49 don't have people around you that you
79:50 think will support you don't tell them
79:55 you know tell them tell them symbolic
79:57 things things are going great it's
80:00 really coming around
80:01 I'm studying some new stuff it's really
80:04 hot stuff I'm gonna change my career and
80:09 they say well what are you doing if it's
80:10 a friend that's gonna reply great and
80:12 you know
80:12 awesome that's awesome great you know if
80:15 you're talking to someone like me share
80:16 everything because man will pump you up
80:18 with real comments with real you know
80:21 support phrases but if you got a
80:24 naysayer in your family your partner's
80:26 not exactly sure what the hell you're
80:28 doing they think you're gonna mess up
80:29 and you got to communicate to your
80:30 partner of course but maybe it's if it's
80:34 some ancillary friend just go well I'm
80:36 letting it be a surprise I'm letting it
80:39 be a surprise but let me tell you one of
80:42 my secrets sorry this is coming so late
80:46 in the episode but this is on the last
80:49 subject here I don't try one thing I try
80:52 two or three things all at the same time
80:55 constantly even if one of them succeeds
80:58 and it starts paying my bills and I
81:00 enjoy I keep the other two or three
81:02 things going maybe I take that off the
81:05 burner because it's working now I go to
81:06 work every day do something for someone
81:08 I'm changing the world in their world
81:10 but I put another one on the bar because
81:12 I got three open slots for things I'm
81:14 trying to do when you don't have money
81:16 coming in and I've had that happen
81:18 several times in my lifetime you're a
81:21 little preoccupied with that worry and
81:23 I'm gonna tell you the secret is not to
81:26 worry about it feel the certainty in
81:29 your heart that that's gonna be taken
81:31 care of but you got to work for it
81:33 remember luck is hard work
81:36 mix with opportunity when you have
81:38 someone say yeah let's see you get a job
81:41 interview at some place right now in the
81:43 technical industry that I'm in you know
81:46 I do web engineering was one of my
81:48 fallback careers there are so many
81:51 platforms out there today that it's sort
81:55 of laughable that these employ the
81:56 employers are sort of of the expectation
81:59 that the random platform that they've
82:01 picked has a tremendous number of coders
82:03 that know how to do it now some of them
82:05 understand and they put their salaries
82:06 up there accordingly we know we have a
82:08 weird language we use we know we have a
82:10 weird platform isn't that exactly the
82:11 most popular platform so we're willing
82:14 to pay you deep-six fidgets six-figure
82:16 digits to handle our proprietary thing
82:20 if you're in a learning curve to rebound
82:23 you're going to have to probably live
82:26 it okay those three things let's say you
82:29 had three things you're gonna try to do
82:30 at the same time work a couple of them
82:33 in areas you're already an expert in
82:35 maybe you just need to sharpen your
82:37 skills I'm an artist okay so no matter
82:40 what I do in art there's ten thousand
82:43 guys out there on the web that can blow
82:44 me away period you'll never get rid of
82:47 that amazing curve unless you really
82:51 super hunker down and come up with a new
82:53 style and something that's in demand and
82:55 it's got some you know stickiness to it
82:57 such the eyeballs want to watch it and
82:59 want to experience it and someone could
83:01 monetize that right but if you're in a
83:06 learning curve that's fine in YouTube is
83:08 your best friend when it comes to
83:10 learning I mean the amount of new
83:12 languages i've learned in the last six
83:14 months is uncanny
83:15 because i already knew virtually every
83:18 language on planet earth but there's
83:20 always some new framework there's always
83:21 some new platform that that language is
83:23 being used in a way that is never I've
83:25 never done it before and you'll find
83:27 that if you're good at something in that
83:29 category learning the new spin on it's
83:32 just oh I see it's a little bit
83:34 different okay but it's generally the
83:35 same thing you made that even easier a
83:38 lot of times that's the way it goes I
83:39 used to have to build that wheel every
83:41 single time I wrote a piece of code now
83:42 it's a library that I just downloaded
83:44 install under a few commands and it does
83:46 everything for me
83:46 perfect but I would recommend if this
83:50 episode appeals to you and if you're in
83:52 the situation go get those other three
83:54 episodes what's called getting back up
83:56 one's called
83:57 taking action and the other one's called
83:59 reinventing yourself those are three
84:01 episodes in the self-improvement group
84:03 on the playlist that could really help
84:06 you get other dimensions of what I'm
84:08 saying perhaps I had a better day and I
84:10 said something's a lot better than I did
84:12 in this episode anyway hopefully that
84:15 was extremely helpful to some of you I
84:18 hope that you can parse through you know
84:23 for those of you who are avid listeners
84:26 to the show you know I don't ever try to
84:30 blow smoke I find that that that has its
84:34 purpose only in absolute dire situations
84:37 where someone is almost irrational
84:39 - just tell them look I'm not can I'm
84:42 not I don't know how to make everything
84:43 better but things will get better cuz
84:45 that's just what happens so I'm trying
84:50 to come to you from genuine experience
84:52 genuine perceptions so just hopefully
84:55 you're getting that vibe let me know in
84:57 the comments if you're sensing anything
84:59 other than that then anyway if you
85:02 haven't been to deep thoughts radio Calm
85:04 please go that's where you can get your
85:05 audio turn to video your video turned
85:07 into audio there's a lakh Facebook group
85:09 Twitter page and a patreon account for
85:12 those who want to tip the account the
85:14 other thing I'm gonna start saying you
85:16 guys of our few episodes is that there's
85:18 a brand new channel for deep thoughts
85:20 season 1 if you go to the website it's
85:22 called season 1 it's the link across the
85:24 top you're on your mobile device you
85:25 gotta click the little slashes and then
85:27 you'll find it please subscribe to that
85:29 channel as well because especially if
85:32 you're not in America there are easily
85:35 two dozen episodes that you haven't seen
85:39 because they haven't been allowed in
85:40 your territory depending on where you
85:42 are especially in Germany ok tell me
85:45 what the deal is with that so that may
85:46 be episode you've never seen and you
85:48 know I'm hoping by 50 I got my format
85:50 down a lot better pull the mic away from
85:52 my face but there's a ton of
85:54 self-improvement in episode 1 because
85:57 that's where I started my focus was
86:00 really hate I've got all this experience
86:03 I have suffered all kinds of different
86:06 hardships and I want to make sure you
86:07 don't suffer those hardships if you can
86:10 and if you are experiencing it and
86:12 you're in the middle of experiencing it
86:14 there's a hundred ways to get out of it
86:16 so if you're in one of those funks get
86:20 in there and listen - just go to the
86:21 self-help self-improvement playlist and
86:24 just start find titles that kind of
86:26 rhyme with what you are you know there's
86:30 there's also episodes probably one of
86:33 the least viewed episodes in the entire
86:35 series is called giving and you might
86:38 think that's a little corny well let me
86:40 let me just tell you that giving is the
86:44 way you get that old saying you know I
86:47 only get back what you put put out I
86:49 believe in not a thousand percent
86:52 a thousand percent when I make money for
86:54 instance I leave large tips with people
86:57 because I feel like I'm giving some you
87:00 know young kid and in most of the cases
87:03 right a fairly decent tip one I want to
87:06 get good service every time I come back
87:07 but to those kids can use that money and
87:10 for something go get their dream so if I
87:13 got a little extra I pass it out one of
87:17 my philosophies is why if I always had
87:19 money why I've always had a job or
87:21 always found something before just
87:22 before my plane hits the ground I think
87:24 I'm like oh my god only God can save me
87:26 at this point the phone rings boom
87:28 there's a job and I'm sitting pretty I
87:32 believe it's because I contribute to the
87:36 universe as much as I possibly again and
87:38 this show is the way I'm contributing to
87:39 the universe so again a lot of you have
87:42 great things to share with the universe
87:44 some of you should probably already have
87:45 YouTube channels you just need to don't
87:48 get a camera or figure out the name of
87:49 your show the name of your channel and
87:51 figure out how you can you know write
87:53 down like 25 to 50 episode titles you
87:55 might do and maybe you copy every title
87:59 I've ever put out or you think you have
88:02 something else to say and you say the
88:03 other half of it you're like episode two
88:06 of deep thoughts you know whatever it is
88:08 I won't be offended
88:10 I'll watch your shows so understand you
88:13 all of you have something some piece of
88:16 wisdom whether you've been able to
88:18 engage it yourself and make it work
88:20 someone else can probably benefit from
88:22 it anyway that's all I got today take
88:27 care of yourself and someone else and
88:29 I'll see in the next deep thoughts over
