00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts I've had an interesting
00:33 request twice as a matter of fact by two
00:36 different people in the last week and
00:38 I'm not sure what's prompting it and
00:40 it's to cover evolution which was my
00:43 second episode and I totally understand
00:46 why people would never know that
00:48 evolution was covered because you know
00:50 we don't really search in the channel
00:53 search that often for those of you
00:55 haven't been to the deep thoughts
00:56 radio.com you probably searched in that
00:58 field you you know if you're like me I'm
01:01 like you we we try to keep the autofocus
01:06 here we try to find things you know just
01:08 buy latest and greatest because that's
01:10 what we want right want the latest and
01:11 greatest stuff got the old HP
01:14 helicopters attention here I know they
01:16 want to smoke cigars one day I'd love to
01:18 have those pilots up there sitting here
01:21 do a big show maybe I'll call the
01:25 department say get your asses over here
01:26 it would be funny so because evolution
01:31 is such a deep subject and because since
01:33 I made the evolution episode which I
01:35 think is extremely thorough and it came
01:38 off the day my lighter still really
01:42 [ __ ] hot I put my hand on it since I
01:46 had just come off of an anthropological
01:47 study of the missing link and I had this
01:52 is one of the areas where I have done my
01:55 own personal research and theories on
01:58 how and a gravity based world how life
02:04 would form in an in a spherical nature
02:08 and then hit the surface of a particular
02:11 area once it reaches a certain mass and
02:12 as it scratches it creates little holes
02:14 and it creates limbs by creating leaks
02:19 where holes you know the internal matter
02:22 comes out and gets protected and becomes
02:23 a leg it goes into all that stuff I
02:26 don't think we're gonna go so scientific
02:29 at least in that meticulous physics
02:32 thing but if you want to think about how
02:35 we are shaped the way we are shaped that
02:38 way
02:38 every body unit seems to have two limbs
02:40 right even a centipede only has little
02:42 little unit and then two legs and the
02:44 crabs got a unit for every two legs
02:47 spiders got units you know some think
02:52 the spider does but anyway don't see
02:56 that it's episode two easiest way again
02:59 just go to deep thoughts radio comm hit
03:01 the search field type in evolution and
03:03 go see the other episode but now here's
03:06 the thing I'm setting up I don't even
03:08 know what I want to do I was thinking
03:10 about doing do Rockets work in space or
03:12 in a vacuum I want to add a little more
03:14 recent research to that because it's
03:15 gonna take you know a whole hour up it's
03:18 gonna need an hour's worth the dialogue
03:20 and I want to really go for not only
03:22 engines we have today but the
03:24 theoretical engines of the future just a
03:27 preview I think they're scenarios with
03:29 today's engines that don't work and I
03:31 think there's scenarios of futuristic
03:32 engines that could work we haven't built
03:34 the futuristic ones so we don't know yet
03:36 and again that's rocket engines but
03:39 evolution is something that comes up a
03:41 lot in conversation because one of the
03:44 interesting things that happens with the
03:47 awakening is that you're awakened for a
03:50 particular subject matter you know could
03:52 be that day in September 2001 it could
03:56 be a recent piece of news or some really
04:01 bad thing happened and you find out that
04:02 there's people who faked those things or
04:04 at least orchestrate them and unreal
04:07 things occur
04:08 whatever complete evolution lists topic
04:15 gets you awake people will once their
04:19 mind wakes up their self realization
04:21 wakes up and they start to ask you know
04:25 more fundamental questions now you could
04:27 wake up without any of the big heavy
04:29 stuff and you're simply going to fill
04:31 philosophy classes you are going to
04:33 evolutionary classes and as long as you
04:36 can think for yourself for one second
04:39 which you know when we're young we're
04:41 all asleep and we're all dumb it's just
04:43 the truth I was right there came in I
04:46 didn't really wake up until probably I
04:48 was 33 years old I mean there was some
04:50 things I was aware of
04:52 but they were just low-hanging fruit
04:54 things right but what is the
04:56 conversation of evolution I've had it so
04:59 many times I've seen so many different
05:00 angles especially am i my lounge but
05:05 even on telephone calls with people and
05:07 in the conversation evolves based on the
05:10 fabric of the human being who's asking
05:12 the question are trying to dig deep for
05:15 instance if someone is very religious it
05:17 is imperative for them to put a bias
05:19 into all the information that they learn
05:21 and route it back to a god base
05:23 creationism technique and and I'm not
05:26 really talking about because you can
05:27 still believe in creationism and not be
05:30 what they might call a holy ruler right
05:32 but there are people on this planet that
05:34 they believe that the world is about
05:36 five thousand years old and those
05:39 individuals will route everything back
05:41 to the five thousand year thing how they
05:43 deal with rumors of things that are much
05:46 older than 5000 years you know you get
05:50 that standard thing that's how the devil
05:51 works and he buries dinosaur bones and
05:54 stuff and again we're gonna cover
05:55 dinosaurs this season five which this
05:58 will be inside of I think season five
06:01 hedgerows taken forever man trying to
06:03 make it as sweet as possible yeah you're
06:05 gonna get tired of hearing that so the
06:07 other one is you have a super atheist
06:09 scientist who has to link everything
06:13 back to popular science and then what
06:19 can I say you you start to get into the
06:24 trust game and you get guilt-tripped if
06:27 you don't trust scientists Wow all these
06:30 people said this and so you have to
06:31 trust them there's a gentleman out there
06:33 does some pretty amazing videos and I
06:36 mean fantastic videos but he has gone
06:38 after some of the conspiracies
06:40 especially Flat Earth and even though
06:42 I'm not technically a flat earther his
06:45 his dig he s he's done two videos I I
06:48 had watched one that was very recent or
06:50 he has the beard and the glasses he's
06:51 bald-headed guy he's a British accent
06:53 and again I really respect this guy but
06:57 his first attempt to going after this
06:59 when he didn't have glasses and he
07:00 looked a little different was the most
07:03 pathetic loyalist
07:06 thing I've ever heard his quotes of what
07:08 flatters people believed was so wholly
07:11 inaccurate and so ridiculous like he
07:13 picks stupid things that I don't think
07:15 anyone's ever said and then he said that
07:17 they say that and then he proceeded to
07:19 debunk them and it's just like come on
07:21 never takes on the issues of NASA right
07:24 NASA it's just for that dude a thousand
07:26 percent real he cannot be caught in his
07:30 circle of friends and his self-image
07:32 ever seeing anything bad about those
07:34 organizations
07:35 despite the mountains of evidence that
07:38 they lie never takes all the photographs
07:40 that have been claimed to have been
07:41 taken from space Chloe if he even
07:44 mentions the Blue Marble shot from
07:45 Apollo 17 never really examining the
07:48 first one that came back where the red
07:49 sees all screwed up because it's a
07:51 composite shot later fixed and never
07:53 told that it was fixed I've shown it to
07:56 you several times on the show then you
07:58 have the UF ologist who's a little bit
08:01 more rational in my opinion because
08:03 they're sitting there going okay
08:05 something for nothing
08:07 atheist Big Bang horseshit physics dies
08:10 gravity is pushing on a pole that all
08:13 falls through as far as religion we'll
08:15 look at religion it's a fiasco
08:17 it's a complete child touching Fiasco it
08:21 always has been
08:22 I mean there's there's tomes from
08:24 certain religions about the the the
08:28 legality of touching kids mostly boy on
08:32 man on boy action it's just it's just
08:34 horrible and then they built the whole
08:37 foundation of how we're supposed to
08:38 behave interesting interestingly enough
08:42 I believe that there is a creator they
08:44 he or she did manage to push through
08:47 some pretty divine knowledge about how
08:50 to be good to each other in some
08:52 religions it's interesting but your you
08:56 apologist is looking for sort of these
08:59 unexplained jumps and evolution but
09:02 don't make any sense based on at least
09:04 what we're allowed to know and then you
09:06 kind of have your fourth group which is
09:08 sort of how I view us we're sort of all
09:11 you know we we're just gonna look at
09:13 things and try to make sense of them and
09:15 maybe we have some sort of God that is
09:18 creating for all
09:19 some purposes and matrix right this form
09:22 of reality we dream in this reality so
09:24 we get the sub reality inside this
09:26 reality so that's interesting right we
09:29 recognize that there is love in the
09:30 universe and all these emotions and we
09:32 don't believe Kurt's Wells bag of
09:34 chemicals we tend to think that love is
09:36 a force that actually comprises reality
09:40 it seems to be the utter objective of
09:42 men it's interesting right we love our
09:46 food if we're starving we love our
09:48 relatives if we're bellies full you know
09:51 it's interesting now my own background
09:56 is very very interesting to me
09:57 personally because I grew up in the sort
10:01 of the Big Bang
10:02 I guess arena but I have to tell you
10:05 without knowing why I felt like that was
10:08 not true I never felt it was true I
10:13 studied it as if I felt it was true and
10:15 you know it's always it's always a
10:17 really groundbreaking moment when you
10:22 you go into science trying to find
10:25 answers and all you find is more proof
10:27 that they don't know what they're
10:28 talking about and before I ever really
10:33 dove into religion which is about 19
10:36 years old to about 21 I know it only
10:39 sounds like three years but it was
10:40 SuperDuper intense right it lives inside
10:42 the community that ran the church as I
10:44 always say I used to tell people that
10:46 you know I was raised in the Catholic
10:48 Church kinda you know I got the
10:50 disturbing weird world of that place and
10:52 then about eight years old my dad
10:54 stopped going to church so then I stayed
10:55 home with my dad on Sundays no one
10:57 forced me to go which I have to say my
10:59 parents are pretty cool my mom wasn't my
11:01 mom who was raised and had that that
11:03 god-awful guilt that they are such
11:06 masters at they let me stay at home it
11:11 was cool you go for Christmas maybe for
11:14 Easter or whatever you're just going cuz
11:15 you know there's some food so then I you
11:21 know as I said many times and I won't go
11:23 through it but I dove into science like
11:25 on a crazy crazy level I always found
11:28 space to be utterly utterly fascinating
11:33 just looking up at the
11:34 stars always just made my creative mind
11:37 go my theoretical mind went nuts as a
11:41 kid and so I simply said look I'm gonna
11:43 I'm gonna learn everything on planet
11:45 earth that is available to learn how
11:49 things work
11:51 cosmology dove into that every single
11:55 entity that man had ever theorized from
11:58 a pulsar to a brown dwarf to a black
12:01 hole to a planet to all the different
12:03 classes of plainness classes of moons
12:05 all that stuff quasars got into it and
12:09 so that was macro every time I research
12:13 the stuff you get to these barriers
12:15 where you find out they don't really
12:16 know what things are and there's a lot
12:18 of disputes about science of you know if
12:21 things are coming at you they're blue if
12:23 they're coming at the speed of light
12:25 they're going away from you it tends to
12:26 do redshift and so they're trying to
12:29 figure out that the universe expands and
12:30 then Earth's back in the middle again
12:32 and then you know Hawking says oh no
12:35 we're on the edge of a balloon you know
12:36 just theory to dig themselves out of bad
12:39 theory all right so then I thought okay
12:43 I started out science in the subatomic
12:46 world but I hadn't really gone back and
12:50 didn't quite know where to go because
12:52 again the internet wasn't around I'd
12:55 read everything in the world
12:56 encyclopedia about subatomic physics and
12:58 you know because all pertained to the
13:01 phenomena on a fission and you know I
13:03 don't think even fusion was much of more
13:06 than a paragraph of conceptual thinking
13:10 we didn't have machines the confusion
13:12 things together but I have to say when I
13:14 saw Back to the Future in the dewbacks
13:16 up the car in the first episode and he
13:17 thrown all the trash in the back of the
13:19 fusion unit to get him to the next movie
13:21 my brain was like right there I totally
13:23 know what he's talking about put
13:24 anything in there it'll work okay so
13:27 then you get into subatomic physics and
13:30 Hawking was my dude I mean he was the
13:32 first one to really write books and talk
13:33 about it in super detail and so that was
13:36 nice I had to had a chance to jump off
13:38 when I grew up and moved out of my
13:40 hometown and went to bookstores I went
13:41 right to the super science sections then
13:44 I learned about universities and I went
13:47 to those section
13:47 a lot of the University books are
13:50 definitely trying to teach the
13:51 mathematics of these entities and so I
13:55 didn't want to get into math I was like
13:57 I still don't have a model it's almost
14:01 like math would be the the next step
14:04 after you have a purpose after you have
14:06 a physical model my brain that's how it
14:07 works I don't need to know how much the
14:09 girders gonna Bend until I know I need a
14:11 girder to go across two posts right two
14:14 supports okay I'm laying this down
14:17 because it's going to I want to talk
14:22 about evolution in a way that doesn't
14:24 get pigeonholed into one of these biases
14:28 so I want to cleanse you of the bias
14:29 hopefully so that we can have a much
14:32 bigger thought process in our heads now
14:35 if you just watch the evolution episode
14:37 two and then you watch this
14:39 you're gonna have some overlap what can
14:41 I do same subject but since people don't
14:43 go back redoing it it's actually very
14:46 valuable right so where where do we
14:51 formally get educated that a human being
14:54 thought about evolution and figured it
14:56 out Darwin Darwin is the son of an
15:01 aristocrat he's a rich kid doesn't need
15:03 to work gets himself a boat called the
15:06 Beagle I believe and he goes down the
15:10 coast of Europe and then he bounces into
15:12 the coast of Africa and he at the entire
15:14 time he's kind of getting off the boat
15:15 and grabbing samples and stuff because
15:18 supposedly has this epiphany that things
15:20 evolve well mmm I think that one of the
15:26 interesting things we can see in terms
15:27 of evolution is dogs we cross breed the
15:31 crap out of them
15:32 we can see that they develop skills the
15:35 pure breads have skills that pay the
15:38 bills right there they're doing
15:40 something that's valuable to us there's
15:41 hunting dogs there's big giant
15:44 Newfoundlands which were used by sailors
15:47 to save sailors in the water because
15:49 there are massive horses and they had
15:51 this really thick you know
15:54 hair obviously it wasn't involved to
15:56 help us save ourselves but you know
15:58 sailors would grab onto these things as
16:00 they swam back to the boat and and they
16:02 get off on the ladder and they'd be okay
16:03 crazy wild but we bred them personally
16:07 for our own use be it pleasure or
16:10 service and we're doing this as human
16:13 beings and so we're thinking well geez
16:15 before Darwin was ever an idea or a
16:19 mistake from his parents Mann has
16:23 understood part of what Darwin submitted
16:26 which was survival of the fittest that
16:28 has got to be one of the most
16:30 low-hanging fruit asinine things to
16:32 publish in a paper and claim that you
16:34 have have split the atom of evolution
16:37 let me tell you the first time survival
16:39 of the fittest worked out for a man now
16:42 unconsciously it would be the water hole
16:45 from 2001 a space odyssey the to two
16:49 tribes of prehistoric man early Homo
16:53 sapiens sapiens probably even hominid
16:54 for Christ's sake chimpanzees gorillas
16:58 whatever right they're gonna have a
17:01 bunch of you're gonna have water water
17:02 holes are very interesting depending on
17:04 your geography it they're rare you might
17:06 have more forests than you have water
17:08 holes and so water holes become this
17:09 coveted thing how many needs your videos
17:12 have you seen where the Elks are trying
17:13 to drink some water but there's some
17:14 alligators in there there's Tigers
17:17 during an water buffalo and they're
17:19 always fighting the indigenous you know
17:21 water predators usually alligators okay
17:26 on that subconscious reptile mind they
17:30 knew how to preserve their life they
17:33 knew that when they had a an advancement
17:35 in technology as 2001 portrayed in the
17:38 fictional movie you know the monolith
17:40 taught the the monkey about the bone
17:42 then he goes back to the waterhole and
17:44 beats the living [ __ ] out of that tribe
17:45 and they take the water all back into
17:48 vac one throw the bone in the air turns
17:50 into the satellite we're on to the next
17:51 act
17:52 okay Homo sapiens sapiens where do we
17:54 find out about this well at some point
17:58 man became sentient self-aware it looks
18:03 into the water as the narcissistic
18:05 moment of seeing his own reflection
18:08 whoa who is that touch my face thing in
18:10 there touched his face oh my god I'm
18:12 gonna fight the water for a little while
18:13 cuz I don't know it's not me after a
18:15 while I'm like uh you know I burped and
18:17 it burped and I smiled it smiled and you
18:19 know what when my lover homeless
18:21 sleeping came up next to me or my
18:23 companion I saw their face I know
18:24 exactly who they are I don't who I am
18:26 but I know they are and they're next to
18:28 me I'm Mike how are you in the water now
18:29 and they're like well that you right
18:31 there and we're talking you know we're
18:33 making this thing okay so we have the
18:36 self realization moment now we can start
18:39 thinking good old-fashioned thinking and
18:42 then you realize that well probably
18:45 every every being on planet earth saved
18:48 maybe birds of some sort and it's only
18:50 because they fly we used to operate
18:53 human beings used to operate in harems
18:56 just like lions just like monkeys just
18:59 like and I'm not saying were related to
19:01 those things I'm just saying
19:03 one man was the big guy that the adult
19:07 and he had all the rein of all the women
19:10 and if all the young kids tried to get
19:12 it with your women you beat them off
19:14 until you get old and then you don't get
19:17 anymore such a bummer
19:19 then we advanced up we start developing
19:22 much more technology shelters and food
19:24 and we start talking a language of some
19:26 sort and then it advances up where the
19:28 survival of the fittest is all about
19:30 still the same thing but the biggest
19:32 dude but the biggest stick gets his way
19:35 gets a women gets the food gets whatever
19:38 he wants to do we understood survival
19:43 the fittest how many millions of years
19:46 before Darwin was ever conceived of
19:48 himself it's been around for a long time
19:51 and it was not an epiphany now if you
19:54 study Bruce Lipton and you read his book
19:56 wisdom of yourselves or the wisdom of
19:59 yourself something like that again I had
20:01 to buy the book for about 80 bucks he
20:03 reads it it's amazing it was on YouTube
20:05 at one point has been taken down it's
20:07 great I hope you get the book on audio
20:08 let him read it too he's got a great
20:10 voice but he studies something called
20:12 epigenetics and epigenetics is where we
20:16 get real evolution the multi-dimensional
20:20 4050 mm
20:22 yes that is evolution it doesn't negate
20:25 God folks it just simply says this is
20:27 how he does it all right there was a guy
20:31 that worked for Napoleon Napoleon just a
20:35 recap real quickly was a calculus genius
20:38 he because he knew calculus really well
20:42 he understood how canons work and he ran
20:45 the Canon division of the French army
20:48 and he would destroy his enemies he knew
20:51 exactly I had a wall hid inside he was
20:54 just a genius at that because of then he
20:57 rose up and became the King of France
21:00 not the king but the leader right I
21:02 don't know if they called him a king or
21:04 not he was a very fair-minded individual
21:06 and one of his things that he did was he
21:09 said if you're the best person for the
21:10 job you get the job I don't care about
21:12 your lineage or any of that crap so
21:15 you're not a crazy person and as the
21:18 story goes there was a gentleman with a
21:20 last name de la Marck de la Marck has
21:23 written written down in history books as
21:25 being a peasant who was a genius and he
21:29 was on this mission at least 20 years
21:33 before Darwin was on his pathetic little
21:36 mission now I have to give Darwin a
21:39 little bit of credit and just saying
21:40 that he had the idea that that this sort
21:43 of thing occurred he just wasn't smart
21:45 enough to put the pieces together maybe
21:47 it had to do with being rich maybe not
21:49 who knows how Telemark got so
21:51 intelligent but what de la Marck
21:53 pioneered by the 1790s okay was
21:58 epigenetics epigenetics has to do with
22:03 every single interaction the human mind
22:06 and body has not only with itself but
22:09 with nature now when we see a giraffe we
22:12 always say that whole thing about the
22:13 neck stretches out because it wants to
22:15 eat things that are higher and higher
22:17 and higher well maybe maybe that's it
22:21 it certainly seems to work out for them
22:22 and giraffes are black one of the most
22:24 amazingly bizarre creatures on this
22:27 planet aren't they just when you see
22:30 them run it's really strange when you
22:31 see in my glove it's really strange when
22:33 you see them fight
22:35 they have these big long legs that they
22:37 know how to kick out but they also swing
22:38 their head with these little nubs that
22:42 they hit each other with a lot of people
22:44 who have tried to anthem horrifies them
22:47 and what you know petting zoos have been
22:49 surprised that they're not so lovey
22:52 dovey right it's not big bird people but
22:55 de la Marck figured out not only the
22:57 low-hanging fruit
22:59 oh there's they see the pun there of
23:03 survival the fittest
23:05 he realized that climate had a huge
23:09 influence on how we change he also
23:12 realized that that our cells are alive
23:17 and that when you touch them we have
23:21 some sort of message that's going back
23:23 and forth on our body I'm not sure you
23:24 understood the electrical properties of
23:26 it although by his age electricity was
23:31 you know obviously understood you know
23:33 who knows the Egyptians seem to really
23:34 understand electricity really well but
23:37 he figured out that your brain
23:39 communicating with your body plays a
23:42 role in your evolution your will to be a
23:44 particular way it could change the way
23:47 you are so he masters this he documents
23:50 this and it's a very very deep subject
23:52 which I'd have to reread the book to
23:54 really regurgitate in season or season 1
23:58 episode 2 I was really really fresh with
24:01 daily marks research so if you want to
24:04 get super detail jump off on that
24:05 episode you'll get a good preview of
24:08 what you'll get out of that book so what
24:10 happens there's a Battle of Waterloo
24:13 when the French lost about a Battle of
24:16 Waterloo to the British the British have
24:19 a dividing conquer protocol that goes
24:24 all the way into stealing and usurping
24:27 the discoveries of other people and then
24:31 claiming them as their own they stole
24:33 the red rosetta stone they don't say
24:36 they discovered it was one of supposedly
24:38 Napoleon's generals and something you
24:40 need to know about the rosetta stone is
24:42 that they say on the rosetta stone okay
24:45 in the bottom two languages especially
24:46 that we know how to read
24:48 that there should be a rosetta stone
24:50 every for that era Ptolemy the fourth
24:52 talking about Alice father the third was
24:54 killed and how he's gonna get revenge
24:57 and how there's gonna be new ways he on
24:59 the stone it says that there's one of
25:01 these in every single port down the Nile
25:04 we haven't found any others but there
25:07 should be I don't know half a dozen a
25:10 dozen other Rosetta stones somewhere
25:13 down and now they don't have the big
25:17 piece missing out the top wouldn't that
25:19 be interesting now the Ptolemies are the
25:21 Romans that took over Egypt when Rome
25:24 conquered Egypt they were going to
25:26 destroy the whole place and the
25:27 ptolemies fell in love with the place
25:28 and said no no no we're gonna take care
25:30 of this and the ptolemies ended up
25:32 dressing up like that the locals and
25:36 Cleopatra's I believe the ninth
25:37 generation ruler she was the first queen
25:40 of their era and so Elizabeth Taylor
25:45 playing Cleopatra is genetically closer
25:49 to than having an African player and
25:51 you'll hear a bunch of folks say that
25:54 she was black she wasn't black she was
25:56 Roman that's why there's hundreds of
26:00 thousands of tombs of Roman people
26:03 buried underneath the soil and big
26:07 caverns in Egypt they loved the
26:10 Egyptians alright if you're worried
26:12 about getting credit in your year I
26:14 guess African American as they say I
26:16 could say black don't worry your people
26:19 built those pyramids I mean just look at
26:20 the faces I mean it's like you know it
26:23 was taken over at some point and Arabs
26:27 did become Pharaohs and did paint their
26:31 own kind on the wall but if you go back
26:32 far enough the pharaohs are black is
26:34 night and they were completely capable
26:36 of painting what they saw painting what
26:40 they are right unfortunately they never
26:43 painted how did they built their
26:44 pyramids right you could expect at least
26:46 one more Egyptian episode in season five
26:49 for sure so okay so Darwin steals or is
26:54 given all of day Lamarck's research day
26:57 the mark is no longer all right
27:00 well problem is that
27:02 Arwen can understand epigenetics he
27:04 can't understand it he cannot conceive
27:07 of the multi-dimensional science the day
27:10 Lamarr came up with and so he throws it
27:12 all the way and you just go read his
27:15 works that's all he could understand but
27:17 anything he did write was most likely
27:19 lifted off a dealer mark just the you
27:21 know the footnotes that he could figure
27:23 out alright so there's your official
27:26 science of evolution from the
27:30 aristocratic British I'm not saying
27:33 anyone in Britain is the same way today
27:35 back then that's how they were everybody
27:38 has their flaws
27:38 now anthropologists developed their
27:44 skill sets over a couple centuries and
27:46 they have become the much more
27:48 interesting researchers of the past
27:53 unfortunately ok with all these type of
27:58 researchers if you ever ask yourself
27:59 how's an anthropologist pay for an
28:02 expedition how does a archaeologist pay
28:06 for their expeditions look no further
28:09 than the first act of Indiana Jones
28:11 where that squirmy kind of guy that
28:15 comes to him at the college has you know
28:18 they have a new mission they're gonna go
28:19 on and and he already has his own
28:21 mission he wants to go on but they have
28:23 to convince someone to fund it they have
28:25 to convince a museum that they're gonna
28:26 get the byproduct of the research yada
28:29 yada yada it's always like some biased
28:35 thing unfortunately I'm unaware and
28:39 maybe you guys can inform me of how
28:41 these individuals would do anything
28:43 independently to any level that is
28:46 really scientific so you might have some
28:49 folks that save up some money maybe they
28:51 work at a university for 30 years they
28:54 save it all up and at 50 or 55 or
28:58 whatever they run out and they spend 10
29:00 20 years or full retirement doing things
29:03 volunteering and getting permits to go
29:06 into foreign countries you know maybe
29:08 that's possible then you have volunteers
29:11 and interns and that kind of stuff which
29:13 also move the ball forward and then you
29:15 have local
29:16 that will assist as well because they
29:18 live a mile away and that's what the
29:20 government pays them to do so the
29:23 Anthropology that I have I guess listen
29:26 to and read mostly listen to because of
29:28 the beauty of video lectures is sort of
29:33 split into two groups one of them is one
29:38 category of anthropologists are the much
29:40 larger group and they are studying an
29:44 insinuating you know there I think a lot
29:47 of these folks are not necessarily
29:50 trying to do anything nefarious we know
29:53 that institutions like the Smithsonian
29:55 have been heavily accused of taking
29:59 bones of giants here in North America
30:01 and losing them again mummies were
30:04 burned in trains in the 1800s there was
30:08 a joke by engineers that they said Oh
30:11 mommy's burn hotter than coal
30:12 they Yanks rate sounds hard to believe
30:16 but I've read that more than once but
30:19 we're talking about evolution so we're
30:21 probably talking about the origin of man
30:23 homeless sapien sapien okay well
30:28 probably one of the first things you
30:31 think about is the missing link which is
30:34 what they call the era that seems to be
30:37 completely devoid of any bones that look
30:40 like our bones prior to the missing link
30:43 we have a ton of hominids apes monkeys
30:46 all kinds of stuff and they seem to be
30:48 in plenty according to the carbon dating
30:53 okay
30:54 millions of years hundreds of millions
30:57 of years before homo sapien sapien
30:59 arrives they have no problem finding the
31:01 bones for these other species hmm now
31:07 when I was a kid the missing link
31:10 if you just hear those words spoken
31:12 listen to what I'm saying
31:13 am I saying multiple links or one link I
31:17 think I'm saying in a singular it's a
31:20 missing link it is one species that has
31:23 not been discovered that is the hybrid
31:26 between the fully articulated human
31:30 skull and the completely reconfigured
31:32 bone structure of a human versus
31:36 everything that preceded it
31:38 big giant Bigfoot sort of hominid Yeti
31:41 things that don't no longer exist
31:43 cro-magnon Neanderthals and then all the
31:47 things that we still have today which is
31:49 chimpanzees apes rhesus monkeys all
31:51 those things right now if you ask an
31:54 anthropologist what is very-- about the
31:56 similarities between supposedly our you
32:00 know tree climbing cousins and us I was
32:04 shocked to find out that their take on
32:06 all of this is we share no bones
32:09 whatsoever with any of those species the
32:14 ones that they we know when they drew
32:16 the funny little graphic from you know
32:18 what is that a rhesus monkey going up to
32:19 a chimpanzee sort of an e but
32:21 Neanderthal and then us as soon as you
32:25 see that drawing oh my god for a lot of
32:26 people like me when I was a kid it makes
32:29 complete sense but it's just a drawing
32:32 now the most repeated estimate that I'm
32:35 gonna give you of how long the missing
32:37 link era went is a hundred and fifty
32:41 million years and that's their science
32:45 race if you don't believe in carbon
32:46 dating that's fine
32:47 think about it though they use their own
32:48 little technique to create a big mystery
32:50 as to how we exist but now what makes us
32:55 different now they might say okay per
32:57 capita of a skull our brain cavity is
32:59 way bigger than the brain cavity of
33:01 anything before us and now I believe
33:02 that's true you might actually have
33:04 brains about the same size but you have
33:06 this big giant beast it's attached to it
33:10 so per capita I don't know why that's
33:13 why they don't gain sentient you know I
33:16 mean we do teach apes and I guess in
33:20 gorillas not quite sure what the species
33:22 difference is between an ape and a girl
33:24 and maybe it's the same thing they teach
33:26 him sign language it's phenomenal I mean
33:28 they do communicate to us right
33:30 was it Robin Williams went and said
33:35 goodbye to one of the famous female
33:38 gorillas and it was touching it's
33:40 amazing she knew
33:42 he made a joke that he was just about as
33:45 hairy as she was which is really funny
33:47 he's such a great guy sorry to see him
33:49 go right so it's not like they're
33:51 completely devoid of communication
33:53 obviously these creatures know how to
33:55 communicate I mean dogs know how to
33:56 communicate
33:58 no sir cants do but just joking but like
34:02 a wolf that can go in packs Lions that
34:04 go in packs you know it seems like
34:06 they're communicating somehow probably
34:08 all mentally right but 150 million years
34:11 and then all of a sudden our skull shows
34:13 up and that's the most amazing thing
34:15 because if I tell you that our bones
34:16 aren't the same as an ape you'll be like
34:18 what the hell you talking about looks
34:19 same to me
34:20 rib cage all leather kind of stuff the
34:22 thing about the difference of our bones
34:23 is that one this is the way how to
34:26 describe to me the per capita bone mass
34:31 that we have as a human being makes us
34:34 the most efficient being of our kind not
34:38 the strongest but the most efficient for
34:41 as much mass as we use to be human
34:43 beings we don't burn a ridiculous amount
34:46 of calories to get a lot of stuff done
34:48 an ape has a gigantic shoulders and arms
34:53 and so what then ended up doing and per
34:55 capita of their bodies around a rhesus
34:57 monkeys a little delicate little guys
34:58 but the shoulders weighed down on the
35:02 ribcage and so the rib cage for a monkey
35:05 or an ape is teardrop our rib cage our
35:09 ribs start going sideways immediately
35:11 horizontal or is not horizon-- all the
35:13 way down big difference so even though a
35:17 fish has a jaw bone and we have a jaw
35:20 bone you wouldn't think of a jaw bone of
35:22 a fish being relative to a human being
35:24 life forces with mouths have jaw bones
35:28 but they're all different and so that's
35:29 when they say the famous line that we
35:32 don't have anything in common with these
35:33 creatures that's what they mean you need
35:36 to remember that when someone starts
35:37 preaching all this monkey we came from
35:40 monkey stuff I don't think we did the
35:43 human skull this is where alien showed
35:47 up God showed up why would God show up
35:50 so late you know
35:51 we have the ability to articulate
35:53 syllables as Mike Myers call
35:56 syllables so we can speak language the
36:02 fact that you can hear me right now well
36:05 what's the difference between us and an
36:06 ape
36:06 well nape has a gigantic cavern inside
36:10 they can howl and you know make those
36:14 little little tiny houses right
36:16 how will so that's when you when you go
36:21 in the jungle you hear all those screams
36:22 and shrieks and wild noises we speak
36:27 when use when you have an anthropologist
36:31 detail the difference between our skull
36:34 and any other skull of sort of a semi
36:37 upright you know primate it's a
36:43 jaw-dropping dissertation when you see
36:46 it the amount of full reengineering of
36:51 what we are from what they are obviously
36:54 there's similarities if you have two
36:56 beings on earth that can stand up
36:57 straight and a rhesus monkeys can do it
36:59 apes can do it they just they weigh so
37:01 much from above it's better for them to
37:03 hit on their knuckles right and sit down
37:04 but something magical took place now
37:09 I've got a book in my house that I
37:11 almost burned a second I started getting
37:13 through it
37:13 it's hurtin by these vegetarian [ __ ]
37:17 scientists just whatever and their whole
37:21 thing is to you know just like so many
37:23 other movements where they want to
37:24 change your complete identity by
37:26 training you really young to complete
37:28 denial what you are is a human being
37:30 that's how I see these folks who wrote
37:32 this book because it was their mission
37:34 statement in the book was demonized meet
37:36 and make vegetarianism the thing let me
37:40 tell you us eating meat was the thing
37:43 that made our brains grow and our eyes
37:45 grow and it made us the dominant thing
37:47 on this planet never get that confused
37:50 okay you can be a vegetarian all you
37:53 want whatever you're no longer
37:54 contributing to the evolution of this
37:56 planet there's my bias you'll have
37:59 energy creativity
38:01 you'll be on fire yeah you might be a
38:04 little more aggressive when someone
38:05 starts to try to take away your freedoms
38:07 I think that's a bad thing
38:09 so if I didn't lose you with that little
38:11 statement man became the dominant
38:15 species on this planet very quickly very
38:20 very quickly you know we hunted in packs
38:25 just like every other creature on planet
38:27 Earth if we were reduced the power went
38:30 out in the world and we're never gonna
38:31 have any back and we have to rediscover
38:32 everything we would start hanging out in
38:35 packs again and we would hunt animals
38:37 and packs because it's the only way to
38:39 do it
38:40 mano y mano you know there's Africans
38:43 that actually still have tribes that say
38:45 if you want to be a man you got to go
38:47 out there and hunt and kill a lion a
38:50 male lion you can't eat they don't even
38:52 allow you to hunt female lines we're
38:53 just kind of cool they're women no
38:55 children now because the numbers of the
39:00 tribes have actually died a little bit
39:02 as most tribes over there don't do that
39:04 anymore they allow all the kids to go
39:05 out by their together in a pack and on
39:07 an animal but what do we do to to hunt
39:12 an animal we found out this real
39:14 interesting thing it's not necessarily
39:15 it is it is an evolutionary property of
39:18 who we are but we can sweat
39:21 we have sweat glands and even though an
39:25 animal will sweat it doesn't act as a
39:27 true relief to them because they have
39:31 fur all over their bodies and so they
39:33 dangle their tongue on their mouth right
39:35 so the way to kill a lion or any big
39:38 animal is to do the slow boxing match
39:42 you wear them down you chase them chase
39:44 him chase them you don't even have to
39:46 worry about even trying to kill a man if
39:48 you get a totally cool shot they happen
39:49 to run around and get themselves in some
39:51 cavern and you can just nail them go for
39:54 it but you you run after them I've seen
39:57 several videos where Africans hunt lions
39:59 and it's it's mind-blowing they just
40:02 chased the lion around until it lays
40:04 down in pants and then a thousand Spears
40:06 come in he bleeds to death done he
40:09 didn't eat the whole thing from head to
40:11 toe right save all the teeth for
40:13 necklaces and all kinds of stuff
40:15 save the fur everything gets used it's
40:20 funny how man used to do that
40:21 now we throw away probably two-thirds of
40:23 the food that we make in the modern
40:25 world crazy but think about it
40:28 we were reengineering we immediately
40:32 became superior like immediately when
40:35 you talk about the evolution or the
40:37 timetable of how far we think or how
40:39 long we think that this realm of
40:40 existence has existed it was damn near
40:43 immediate boom per charge hmm so then
40:51 the question starts to arise where did
40:54 that happen how did it happen well most
40:58 of you have heard the old saying that we
41:00 came out of a single female in North
41:02 Africa hmm all right who cares
41:06 honestly who cares I think honestly for
41:10 my black listeners there's a pathetic
41:12 thing that goes on with white people and
41:14 they you know unless they're mapping it
41:17 to Arab you know know-how or whatever as
41:20 long as they if I person some white
41:23 people when they get attached back to
41:25 Africa and they realize they have black
41:27 roots because black people create
41:29 albinos and they're white and if they
41:32 continue mating you will have white
41:34 people but if white people mate forever
41:37 you're never gonna get a black person
41:38 out of us they hate that so if you ever
41:42 heard anyone being resistant towards
41:44 that formula and we don't know that
41:47 that's exactly true who knows but you
41:50 might get like a nonsensical resistance
41:52 because of that racist reason it's dumb
41:56 now what what could have happened yeah
42:03 let's say the Big Bang never happened
42:05 but something you know everything's
42:07 everything that exists today is existed
42:09 forever where it is and so eventually
42:11 the random nature of the is because
42:13 everything does exist life does form
42:16 into a blue algae and grows up to be
42:18 everything else the vegetarian book I
42:21 forgot to finish my point the vegetarian
42:23 book what tried to suggest that the
42:25 reason why there's 150 million years of
42:28 missing bones that account for this gap
42:31 between what existed before Homo Sapien
42:33 say you've been and what existed
42:35 after it was that we went into the
42:36 forest we went into the rain forest and
42:39 that's where we lived and because we
42:41 lived in the rain forest all of our
42:42 bones dissolved into the rain forests
42:45 were eaten by the insects and so that's
42:47 how we lost all of our history a hundred
42:51 and fifty million years don't think so
42:54 nobody ventured out and 150 million
42:58 years hell 50 million years nobody
43:00 ventured out and said you know and I'm
43:01 you guys knock yourself out here in this
43:04 forest I'm gonna go over the elephant
43:06 bone graveyard and I'm gonna see what's
43:08 up north I don't buy it now could you
43:12 imagine if there was some condition
43:15 where the albino black was happening for
43:20 some very specific nutritional reasons
43:22 some other phenomenon and there's a
43:24 bunch of them and they're they're
43:27 shunned and so they're pushed north or
43:31 south and they mainly north I would
43:35 imagine right so they get into Europe
43:36 and then they breed and then we have
43:38 this other lighter-colored reefs and
43:40 because perhaps there's not so much Sun
43:43 maybe we don't ever develop the thicker
43:45 or the darker pigment and our skin who
43:48 knows maybe just throwing things out
43:50 there but it usually devolves down to I
43:53 guess three theories evolution did
43:58 happen somehow not the way that they say
44:00 but it happened to God just simply said
44:05 you know what I have been working in my
44:07 laboratory here and I got this new
44:09 design uh apes are pretty cool rhesus
44:11 are pretty cute things that they steal
44:13 my Fritos every time I let him in the
44:15 laboratory but I just throw this down
44:19 here's just see what happens I think
44:21 these guys are gonna eat the whole place
44:22 alive poof we're there now so Adam and
44:26 Eve thing Andy who knows whatever but
44:30 there's the third one but I think
44:32 because of the sudden introduction and
44:35 one other thing I'm going to mention
44:37 seems to bear truth to me it speaks to
44:44 me it makes sense to me
44:47 and it's a little romantic I guess I'm
44:50 probably guilty of a little bit of that
44:51 but I mean honestly I keep searching my
44:54 soul and I keep coming back to this and
44:57 it's where it feels cool and all the
44:59 algorithms in my heart just all the
45:01 sudden go mm-hmm
45:02 perfect right and that is the alien drop
45:06 off perhaps the alien distribution now
45:11 visual cortex found out from an
45:14 anthropologist gave a very detailed
45:19 medical presentation probably can never
45:22 find this guy I've actually tried to
45:24 search for this presentation cannot find
45:26 it two years ago and for this to share
45:28 it with you guys couldn't find it so
45:29 frustrating makes you feel like a liar
45:31 but this dude went into great detail
45:34 about the visual cortex and he said that
45:35 if you just envision the little grid of
45:39 cells on the back of your brain where
45:41 your eyeballs just happen to project
45:43 everything upside down and backwards you
45:45 know look at the draw that our brain has
45:47 to sort out upside down and backwards
45:49 didn't have to but I guess it doesn't
45:51 matter it's all relative to our memory
45:54 banks yes we want it I guess what we
45:56 want is it to be physically aligned with
45:58 the world that we see right we don't
45:59 want to find out it's upside down
46:00 backwards which is different than what
46:01 we see but the visual cortex is five
46:04 layers of cells and the guy basically
46:06 said just think of a slice of cheese
46:08 slightly smaller than a slice of like
46:10 American cheese I guess you have French
46:13 cheese and British cheese over there too
46:16 but he said that there is a genetic
46:18 blocker down the center of the first
46:21 layer which is what our visual cortex
46:23 actually taps into our eyeball step into
46:25 an our brain rasterizes this first layer
46:27 I guess it rasterizes all five layers
46:31 but it does not none of the visual
46:33 information we get from my eyeballs is
46:35 traveling beyond the first half of the
46:37 first layer and he said that there is a
46:39 genetic blocker in there the gist is
46:42 like someone terminating memory like if
46:46 you can zoom up memory in a computer
46:47 just terminating the memory so that
46:49 nothing could jump over this little DMZ
46:52 zone hmm that doesn't feel like
46:55 evolution to me at all five layers four
47:00 and a half aren't used
47:01 well five layers would divide up a
47:05 hundred percent into twenty percent
47:06 increments half is ten percent okay what
47:12 would happen if we could use the rest of
47:13 our visual cortex what would it see what
47:17 if the light waves that we see with our
47:21 eyeballs be they photons that we
47:24 normally see or a bunch of x-rays and
47:26 ultraviolet light and a bunch of you
47:28 know frequencies that we can't
47:30 necessarily see it's like Geordi in Star
47:33 Trek next generation he's got his visor
47:35 he could see all kinds of different
47:36 bandwidths and he became a very
47:38 important tool to the story all the
47:40 stories that he was in well it seems
47:44 like if that was intentional that there
47:46 was there is something that is viewable
47:48 with the other 90% of our visual cortex
47:53 that might reveal where we are there are
47:57 lots of theories about interdimensional
47:59 aliens that walk around among us and
48:03 what if you could see him if you had the
48:06 rest of your visual cortex hmm now we
48:09 also have a lot of land all over this
48:13 thing we're on a lot of different
48:16 continents and we always find indigenous
48:18 life in those contents very few
48:20 continents have ever been discovered
48:21 with no human life on them because we
48:24 get around there is ample evidence that
48:27 the Romans made it to South America in
48:31 like you know was a 400 AD so we got a
48:36 round now whether or not they turned
48:39 into the Incas who knows seems like we
48:44 have very it's it's one of the most
48:46 brilliant things that we have this
48:48 distinct genetics that are on different
48:51 areas like the aborigine look much
48:53 different than the folks in Africa Arabs
48:56 don't look like Africans whites just
48:59 divide up all the different nations that
49:01 we have where we've inbred to look
49:02 different obviously we tend to pick what
49:05 we feel like is the most attractive
49:06 algorithm and the face and I think I'm
49:10 gonna throw this out there one of the
49:11 most powerful evolutionary
49:14 instruments of mankind is the woman not
49:18 just because women give birth but
49:21 because women care about what we look
49:23 like men care too but we don't care as
49:26 much if it came down to like well okay
49:28 you can either have no sex or you can
49:30 have some sex but you know you may not
49:33 find them terribly attractive if you've
49:35 learned a formula that makes you turned
49:38 on which one do you want you want no sex
49:40 or sex and the guy's gonna go sex
49:42 definitely for sure she's heavy she's
49:44 strange-looking doesn't matters can I
49:46 have some yeah okay okay
49:47 but women they'll abstain if they don't
49:50 like what they see
49:51 why do men age better than women because
49:54 women design men women make choices
49:56 about who the men are going to be and
49:59 then that infects both genders as soon
50:01 as they have babies the women are gonna
50:05 be there genetics and the man's Jennings
50:07 boom the men well maybe take on after
50:11 their fathers who knows but now here's
50:14 what's interesting I have been recently
50:16 binge watching these videos I think I
50:20 just mentioned it in one that's not out
50:21 yet that I've been watching the videos
50:25 where they discovered the tribes of New
50:27 Guinea some of the tribes in Peru
50:31 these tribes that have not been
50:33 discovered yet and there's others that
50:34 are in the I think it's Brazilian
50:38 forests and Argentine forests in just
50:41 the forest areas of the rainforests of
50:43 South Africa South America I don't hear
50:46 it too much in Africa anymore I come
50:49 from a little town in Kansas and Chanute
50:51 Kansas and one of the most famous things
50:56 that ever happened for our town was that
50:57 there was a woman named OSA Martin OSA
51:03 and Martin Johnson OSA Johnson so she
51:05 married Martin Johnson she was 16 when
51:07 it happened I believe maybe even younger
51:09 this chick was badass she was a little
51:11 teeny teeny woman from my home town this
51:14 guy I met her I think you know here we
51:16 go with the the numbers again but this
51:18 was the different arrows early 20th
51:20 century he comes our little home town
51:22 and presents this African stuff that he
51:27 went over and got
51:28 that's what he did we go over it he
51:30 would film new tribes that he had
51:32 discovered and he bring the video back
51:34 with a bunch of their stuff and then he
51:36 just do a tour in the United States
51:37 raise a bunch of money and go back and
51:38 do it again he he bumped into OSA and
51:43 fell in love with her she was like 13 or
51:46 something really young and her parents
51:49 are like yeah go for it now she was not
51:51 some we didn't make the soft little kids
51:56 that we make today
51:57 you were pretty grown up by 16 to be
52:00 honest okay 13 you were you were pretty
52:03 amazing but to give you an idea of the
52:05 balls on this chick okay pardon all the
52:08 slang there's a video of her with a big
52:13 like a buffalo rifle thing and there is
52:17 a goddamn tiger I'm sorry lion male big
52:23 running right at her and this chick it's
52:27 like no more than 16 years old just
52:29 calmly lifts this gun and I mean it's
52:31 like a movie it's like a movie scene
52:33 that you wouldn't believe if they did CG
52:36 on it right you would believe it would
52:37 have ever happened in real life this
52:38 thing's running right at her she just
52:40 takes his gun goes boom and kills this
52:42 thing and it just put your do drew just
52:44 dies right now back in the day there
52:46 were a lot of lions wasn't exactly a big
52:48 poaching problem back in the day and
52:51 then she turns to the camera and smiles
52:53 I got him
52:54 it's just that easy so that's how ballsy
52:57 this chick was but anyway they had they
53:01 flew over so many times he actually died
53:03 in a plane accident unfortunately and
53:05 then she end up running her story the
53:07 awesome Martin Johnson book is a very
53:09 famous book it's got a tiger skin cover
53:13 on I've got for him in my house and
53:15 about 150 bucks if you find it nowadays
53:17 so when you see these tribes that are
53:21 discovered there's a brilliant one this
53:23 French guy who's like Jean Pierre
53:25 something like that I don't know when
53:27 this video was shot 1990s it looks like
53:29 to me it's a four by three aspect ratio
53:31 but he's filming it's about a 17 minute
53:34 baby there's three of them this tiny
53:38 truck that means tiny like group of
53:40 people it's about four
53:42 I just mentioned this I'm sorry and
53:44 previous video but we're on evolution so
53:46 this is this is fascinating to me
53:48 because it I made a friend of mine watch
53:50 it yesterday and then we had some more
53:53 epiphanies that I want to share with you
53:55 but it takes about 10 minutes for him to
53:58 to let them come across this rivers
54:01 about for adult males about maybe six
54:03 little kids seeming all boys but I don't
54:06 know if you just can't tell some girls
54:08 in there too but just very few wives
54:10 maybe like three wives fully pregnant
54:13 right so they make contact with this guy
54:15 and if you think he's painted because
54:16 he's white and they also think that he
54:18 might be the dead like a ghost and so
54:21 once they start touching him and stuff
54:23 and it's a very tumultuous first few
54:26 minutes and again is just like what blew
54:29 my mind was that when they touched hands
54:31 he would hold out his hand palm up
54:33 obviously thinking they might do their
54:35 hand palm down but they're doing their
54:37 hand palm up to and touch up fingertips
54:39 and the second they touched him they
54:40 would literally tremor jump and grab a
54:42 weapon and get ready to kill the person
54:45 right it was very much like the Apes
54:47 portrayed in 2001 a Space Odyssey and I
54:50 don't mean to say that these these these
54:52 tribes people were definitely black but
54:55 it was just an interesting fear thing
54:57 that was happening and I don't know
54:58 where Stanley got the idea that that
55:00 might be a reaction to technology and so
55:04 it was just a fascinating thing but this
55:06 tribe is so endearing once they finally
55:08 make full communication contact they
55:11 don't speak the language but the guy is
55:12 translating words means up speaking
55:14 their language and they were just a
55:17 wonderful group of people they sang like
55:20 a song of tribute to them when they left
55:22 I mean it was just endearing they
55:24 dressed up too but they went came across
55:27 the river and saw a bunch of modern
55:29 technology but here's what's interesting
55:30 that I didn't pick up on one the chief
55:35 of this New Guinea tribe looked like a
55:41 famous actor who was in Deadwood he
55:44 played the general as a black guy I
55:47 won't say what they call Danny's the
55:49 n-word the n-word generals his official
55:53 caste
55:54 character name he's a brilliant actor
55:56 he's been around since the 70s he's
55:58 phenomenal but there's a genetic
55:59 similarity in their faces and I was
56:00 thinking oh my god
56:01 even though this guy was born in United
56:04 States and became an actor and all that
56:05 sky New Guinea kind of looks like him
56:07 it's just wild how you see the genetics
56:08 you know go around the world right
56:10 but this tribe had really really long
56:14 bows I mean these really beautiful super
56:16 long bows and their arrows are really
56:18 long super Street and of course they
56:21 they also figured out weaving whatever
56:26 they have access to into these really
56:28 dense little capes that they wear which
56:31 they said was a kind of a raincoat by
56:35 day and they're blanket at night and you
56:39 see these elaborate they film these
56:40 women you know doing these elaborate
56:43 sewing of these things
56:45 I'm sure the men do it too but so think
56:49 about it now they weren't they had
56:52 reported that they had found and been
56:54 and actually harmed by another fellow
56:57 tribe and they had all their drums
56:58 stolen that they used to use and a bunch
57:01 of them died they died of malaria a lot
57:03 supposedly it seemed like they'd be
57:05 genetically immune to malaria because
57:08 how do you survive in the jungle if
57:09 that's just flying around in mosquitoes
57:11 belly right jean-pierre and his guys
57:14 gave them medicine to to fight that
57:19 moving forward and let the authorities
57:22 know look you've got to visit these guys
57:23 are once wanna update their medicine so
57:26 anyway we started looking at this and
57:28 then you looked at the tribes in Peru
57:32 same type of boat same type of arrow the
57:37 Peruvian tribe had very little cloth
57:40 they were mainly tying their body parts
57:44 to keep them from being in the way but
57:46 it's funny how man even totally
57:48 sequestered comes up with this stuff
57:51 all of us do as if there's programming
57:56 in man to do these things and obviously
58:00 survival of the fittest you're gonna
58:01 learn how to hunt and there's only a
58:03 couple ways that a human being can hunt
58:05 an animal so they figured out
58:08 at this particular tribe was actually
58:10 because of the bird population New
58:12 Guinea very apt at hunting birds which
58:16 has got to be you know if I said go
58:19 catch a boar it's on the ground it's
58:22 much easier to corner and do whatever
58:24 you got to do with but a bird
58:26 it's fly it sees you flies away it
58:29 learns that you're a predator and boom
58:31 it's gone so you have to sneak up on a
58:32 thing pretend you're bird this chief had
58:34 all these wild whistles super cool so
58:38 the unanswered question for me and again
58:41 we play the game what if we were the
58:43 aliens and I know there's a lot of
58:46 Planet X and the Bureau theories and
58:48 also stuff but go see my episode on
58:50 Planet X will dispel the logic of
58:52 anything that's been communicated about
58:53 that phenomenon we have structures all
58:57 over the world that are completely
58:59 unexplained craftsmanship that is off
59:02 the chain I mean so ecliptic aliy beyond
59:07 where we are today it hurts the brain if
59:11 you really want to conceive of G's like
59:13 how I mean you have like untapped earth
59:16 right just pure unex cavae 'td
59:20 untampered with earth and then up on
59:23 this hillside you'll see stones carved
59:25 in perfect 90-degree angles with you
59:28 know there's got where it is it's in
59:30 South America and what's interesting is
59:34 South America you know as well as Africa
59:37 too you know they get underestimated for
59:39 their accomplishments and then we find
59:41 Machu Picchu and all these other crazy
59:42 things and they're extremely honest you
59:44 know they used to say the Incas used to
59:46 say look these word before the people
59:48 before us they don't know anything about
59:50 the people before them fascinating right
59:52 but you'll find these structures in the
59:55 middle of nowhere sometimes made a rock
59:58 that's like really really far away and
60:00 there is a I need to research it more
60:03 but there's this new way again its I
60:08 kind of have a love-hate relationship
60:12 with these put these theories that seem
60:14 to try to minimize the ingenuity of
60:17 prehistoric man or at least the man that
60:20 came before us he was probably L
60:21 smarter than we are about how to run the
60:23 world but there's the the huge rocks in
60:27 South America that aren't part of Machu
60:29 Picchu but they're big dark black rocks
60:31 and they're all beveled and they're all
60:34 interlocking most of you seen this then
60:37 there's that other location where they
60:38 have these rocks that are stacked up and
60:40 everything is 90-degree angles I mean
60:42 like windowsills
60:43 for no reason big giant buildings that
60:46 the locals said were carved by the
60:49 angels where they have like this this
60:51 temple it's carved in a plus sign and
60:54 it's out of one gigantic rock and it's
60:56 just perfect
60:57 it's just perfect and you're like holy
61:00 hell I mean even the locals don't claim
61:02 they made it they say angels came down
61:03 and did it well what would an alien be
61:05 it'd be an angel so if I was an alien
61:08 and I had some genetic knowledge and I
61:10 come down and I find the indigenous life
61:13 you'd start from that genetic I would
61:15 think then you have your own genetic
61:18 that's obviously mastered the ability to
61:21 travel or own a dome or whatever the
61:25 case might be and so you'd want to mix
61:27 your programming with its programming
61:30 and you would know everything about it
61:31 because it would be your first time
61:33 Earth probably wouldn't be the first
61:34 thing they would have ever done
61:35 something like this but then you need to
61:38 nurture your new creature because you do
61:41 have you know infants that are
61:43 vulnerable human infants are extremely
61:46 vulnerable as most infants are now with
61:49 like certain creatures like an elephant
61:52 is I mean yeah stumbles for a little
61:54 while horse was at a mirror stumbles
61:57 around a little bit but you know they're
61:59 pretty good after a couple days they're
62:01 little that's about it you know they
62:04 have to be able to avoid being hunted at
62:06 the end of the pack but that's why the
62:08 adults are there you seen adult
62:11 elephants protect their young like
62:12 nothing else men most creatures do and
62:16 it's out of love all right that other
62:18 force that we don't exist we don't
62:20 recognize right so then again we have
62:24 different quote-unquote races within the
62:28 human Homo sapiens sapiens species you
62:32 know today we have very distinct Asian
62:35 looks and we have very distinct African
62:37 looks versus Aborigine a lot of
62:40 different whites right and in some cases
62:42 we can see how two neighboring countries
62:45 bred together I've always I was always
62:48 told that a fair amount of the Russian
62:51 population because it's such a huge
62:52 country and because they simply say
62:54 you're Russian now we've conquered early
62:56 in your Russian oh okay I guess I'm
62:58 Russian right but there's a lot of you
63:02 know whites that have cross bred with
63:04 Asian and so they have much different
63:07 look it's very interesting so I'm not
63:10 talking about the crossbreeding between
63:11 our different races I'm talking about
63:13 sort of the core race so what do we
63:16 usually think about we think about a
63:17 race and how it affords well some people
63:20 got stuck there and they made it you get
63:23 the the Polynesian races which are mini
63:27 right if you ever tell of Samoan you
63:29 know just walk up and say you Samoan
63:31 there's all kinds of Samoans are you
63:33 gonna be careful because they certain
63:35 Samoans consider themselves over other
63:37 Samoans and so you can't just be
63:39 flippant about some of those
63:40 conversations probably the case with all
63:42 races right if you're an alien you've
63:45 got flight and so you see the world all
63:48 at once whatever shape it is and you
63:52 would probably want to say okay we're
63:54 gonna experiment a little bit here and
63:58 you know maybe maybe the white race was
64:01 it was alien maybe they did a little
64:05 formula for up north because it's more
64:07 snowy and they changed our skin maybe
64:09 you know Africans got a little bit
64:11 different Arabs are kind of in the
64:12 middle kind of an olive skin you know
64:14 you're more Middle Eastern look you're
64:17 Aborigines are obviously would be a
64:20 spinoff of the the black race algorithm
64:24 which ever you know however they did
64:26 that but Arbor genies have a different
64:29 look the different geometry to their
64:30 face what blows my mind about this is
64:34 that especially with your various Samoan
64:37 races your Polynesian races that made it
64:39 to the faraway places like Hawaii like
64:43 was a comedic emmaus the theory of the
64:45 storyline there it makes sense to me
64:48 everyone on north north america south
64:51 america everybody in europe africa and
64:55 eurasia
64:57 all those races are part of the bigger
64:59 continents and because Alaska you can
65:02 cross over in the wintertime it makes
65:04 sense that we got to both sides even if
65:07 we started on one side that makes sense
65:09 to me
65:10 Australia maybe if you go through the
65:14 Indonesian islands and you just keep
65:16 going south okay all right but there's
65:19 two places on earth
65:20 that blow my mind to pieces okay and the
65:24 fact that at least one of them has
65:26 phenomenal art and expression which is
65:32 Easter Island Easter Island is so far
65:37 out in the Atlantic boonies it blows the
65:41 mind that with primitive boats because
65:44 he asked the white man was like geez was
65:48 like 17 well I guess sorry we were going
65:50 across the Atlantic at least by the
65:53 1400s right but we're talking about
65:55 Easter islands got these giant busts and
65:58 they're full people right there all the
66:00 way down to their feet but they're just
66:01 buried up to their necks they got there
66:04 they found a way to live right I think
66:06 today there's no way to live there off
66:08 the indigenous food I don't think but
66:11 they have these these guests like gods
66:16 that they carved and they point their
66:19 face in a particular strategic direction
66:20 some point back to the island some point
66:22 on the ocean and then Hawaii if you
66:27 thought the Atlantic was big the Pacific
66:30 is massive how do you put in a ship
66:34 let's just take the 1,400 ships right
66:37 how do you accurately hit a needle in a
66:40 haystack in the middle of the Pacific in
66:42 a way that you can survive the trip
66:45 think about how hungry these people were
66:48 when they hit that island if they just
66:49 migrated over in boats so the alien
66:52 theory is extremely convenient of course
66:54 because once we start mentioning alien
66:56 stuff and then we don't to really do any
66:58 science about anything else
67:00 so I observed
67:01 and understand that that's sort of the
67:04 benefit of maybe cowering down to that
67:09 theory but for me the visual cortex
67:11 thing was huge the we articulation of
67:13 the skull was huge and the fact that we
67:16 are not physically the most formidable
67:20 thing on this planet and you know I've
67:21 heard several comments over the last I
67:24 don't know 30 years where people were
67:25 talking about compared to all other
67:29 creatures including a house dog we're
67:33 pretty we're pretty fragile
67:35 I mean you remotely touch our skin with
67:37 a claw we're bleeding
67:39 well bleeding meant you you walk through
67:43 a river and you caught you know some
67:46 amoeba and you got gangrene and you died
67:48 one thing I learned recently from this
67:51 this gentleman it makes those videos is
67:54 that moats around castles which are
67:59 always portrayed at Disneyland
68:01 Disneyworld and all the movies we've
68:03 ever seen is fairly clean clear moats
68:05 and there's simply just a like a mud a
68:08 mud problem and a depth problem for
68:10 someone in Armour to get across moats
68:13 were actually the most disgusting things
68:16 imaginable because all of the sewage
68:19 from inside these castles you would go
68:22 the bathroom on one of the walls inside
68:24 and the chute just went diagonally
68:27 straight out to the moat so the mode is
68:28 full of all the waste product of every
68:31 single human being that's in the area if
68:34 you if you had any waste at all they
68:37 would put it through these holes and it
68:38 would go down and rot so you got a
68:40 compost you got a su eg a septic tank
68:42 down there I mean it's just awful so
68:44 falling in one of those things would
68:46 mean almost certain death because if
68:48 you're in war of any kind you got a cut
68:51 and if you got a cut and you fall on
68:52 that you are gonna die within days if
68:54 you're lucky and it's going to be
68:56 unbelievably painful right the probably
69:00 the most fascinating question about
69:01 evolution is why do we care
69:04 why do we care for scientists it's a
69:08 matter of academia it would be
69:13 submitting some theories the inter
69:15 lock to solve the question so that you
69:19 can feel completely enlightened about
69:21 the existence of man and how we fit into
69:24 the universe I respect that tremendously
69:26 if you're religious then it is really
69:29 your sort of bond with God your
69:33 inception Aban with God you want to feel
69:36 like when you look at your hand that it
69:39 was designed by God I think it was I do
69:42 because I believe in a God not the same
69:45 one and organized religion believes in
69:47 but it's probably the same dude or
69:50 dudette if you're into the alien theory
69:53 and you don't mean just think about it
69:56 just think if we ever had a visitation
69:58 from aliens a real one not a fake one
70:00 think about how quickly it would change
70:03 everything in your mind about evolution
70:05 I mean it may even be subconscious
70:08 you're standing out in front of your
70:09 house see let's live on a circle or
70:11 something and here comes a flying saucer
70:14 lands right and funny i got an episode
70:16 called meeting an alien if you want to
70:17 really digest the microsecond to
70:19 microsecond state of mind you might go
70:22 through with that but just seeing
70:24 something walk out that it's most
70:25 definitely not human you see technology
70:28 that's most definitely not from this
70:29 world
70:30 you see them leave you see me but they
70:33 give you some great sandwich or
70:37 something without them saying anything
70:39 if your mind travels back to this
70:42 conversation and every conversation
70:43 you've ever had about evolution and the
70:47 mystery thereof wow it's solved it
70:51 solved up to a point without having
70:54 conversation with them and saying did
70:55 you put us here did you make us imagine
70:57 having that conversation did you make us
70:59 I mean if Roswell does is totally true
71:04 as I have to admit I do believe it is
71:07 true up to a point and then one alien
71:10 survives and they're able to communicate
71:13 through mental telepathy or whatever
71:16 someone would have to have asked the
71:19 question that Wilde asked question did
71:22 you put us in did you make us does
71:25 someone like you do this do you know
71:28 did someone else make us but they're
71:30 like you imagine the answer coming back
71:34 yes like how massive you think you've
71:39 had goosebumps in your lifetime
71:41 you'd have goose mountains man huge now
71:46 the other thing is we're kind of done
71:51 with the core conversations this is why
71:53 sort of meander to finish off the cigar
71:56 and try to make it interesting for you
71:57 guys
71:58 it's the bonus round they always tell
72:00 you and it was funny I think it was dr.
72:03 Stanton who just passed god bless that
72:05 man he's a physicist who was a you'll
72:08 follow gist if you haven't heard of him
72:09 you know the the beard and the amazing
72:14 eyebrows he made a point once in a
72:16 documentary about aliens he said you
72:18 know because they said you know well do
72:19 you think this'll ever happen in your
72:20 lifetime and in the 90s he was very
72:22 certain it was going to happen in the
72:24 next decade and I thought that was
72:26 interesting because Stanton always kept
72:28 things pretty dry and pretty realistic
72:30 so if you know there's that funny dude
72:33 who I've never seen speak he's in the
72:36 memes with his giant hair and I guess he
72:38 did a documentary about aliens and I
72:40 just I've never seen that guy can't
72:41 possibly take that dude seriously god
72:43 bless him but Stanton always kept things
72:46 pretty dry but Stanton said well you
72:49 know what even if aliens did come down
72:50 tomorrow I still have to go to work the
72:53 next day my bills are still do now maybe
72:56 if aliens came down and said you know
72:58 we're gonna totally upgrade the world
73:00 maybe he's not right but I think that
73:02 would be the plan you'd have to plan for
73:04 yeah you're gonna have to go back to
73:07 work you are even if it takes take a day
73:10 off right
73:11 hey man I had aliens in my back yard I
73:13 just couldn't make it to work you
73:15 understand right so take that sentiment
73:18 into your head I think about you well
73:23 let's just say aliens land all over the
73:24 place there's a bunch of them they're
73:26 all really nice no one's got laser
73:28 weapons yeah there's a couple
73:31 hillbillies that take shots at them but
73:35 maybe they know better maybe they can
73:36 make us more comfortable I don't know
73:38 hopefully jeez it's a scary thought that
73:42 some guy would take a potshot at one of
73:44 them and and ruin it for everybody
73:46 there's that funny as far side where the
73:49 aliens that look like hands it's their
73:52 head and suddenly the farmer shakes
73:56 shakes their head because it looks like
73:58 a hand you know it's such a brilliant
73:59 thing but imagine you're able to ask the
74:02 question everyone's asking questions
74:04 right they got all the answers prepared
74:06 of course they know what we're gonna ask
74:07 but you ask that question you know did
74:09 you make us and they go yeah if they
74:11 said yes what would you do if you're a
74:14 Christian and you're always told God did
74:17 everything would you immediately go to
74:19 the devil card and demonize our creators
74:23 our cousins our parents whatever you
74:26 want to call them would that be sad we
74:31 can't even appreciate the truth mm-hm I
74:34 would hope not I would hope we could
74:37 deal with it but now let me ask you this
74:40 if but let's put it this way every
74:46 single person alive today was raised
74:47 with heliocentric groundball earth
74:49 everybody was still are but there's this
74:53 growing faction of folks that do believe
74:55 we're still in a flat disk of some sort
74:57 which I guess means we're really close
75:00 to God or were really close to aliens
75:01 it's really no other way to explain such
75:04 an illogical shape floating in space you
75:08 have to negate all theories of ether and
75:10 gravity to get to that point okay and
75:13 it's really an exercise in just you know
75:16 observing reality and only giving
75:18 credence to what you can observe the
75:22 British guy made fun of people who said
75:26 you can't see curvature of the earth
75:28 from a plane and which is actually the
75:30 truth but the guy didn't do any of his
75:32 science and so he's ridiculing everybody
75:34 so sad can it makes me wonder if
75:37 anything else the guys says his truth
75:39 right but people people were told hey
75:46 this these agencies that tell us it's
75:48 round or caught telling all kinds of
75:50 lies moon mission lies pictures of Earth
75:53 from space lies and
75:55 it's just it's countless right okay so
75:57 we have a bad guy on one side it's
75:59 legitimate and then we were trying to
76:01 rediscover what we believe okay now that
76:07 you let's just say you never knew about
76:10 the missing link thing I just told you
76:12 how big the missing link era was about
76:14 the visual cortex being blocked and it
76:17 starts to sink in with you do you own
76:18 research verify what I'm saying by the
76:22 way if you find in are an anthropologist
76:24 talking about that in a lecture one of
76:26 them was linked to a guy he eventually
76:29 went off on Bigfoot Wallace just dude
76:31 all by himself
76:32 didn't go there both are by themselves
76:34 but let me know post in the comments
76:37 please but now that you can conceive of
76:40 the potential that an alien dropped us
76:43 off now we have to reverse engineer what
76:46 could have possibly occurred did they
76:49 create multiple versions of man with
76:52 different purposes different strengths
76:55 different weaknesses and place us
76:58 geologically where we would benefit most
77:01 with our genetics and just let it go and
77:04 perhaps who knows you know maybe they
77:09 had a very close relationship with us
77:12 for a long time you know all biblical
77:13 references seem to say that God was
77:17 around all the time talking to us all
77:19 the time making us do ridiculous things
77:21 right
77:21 you know angels coming out of the sky
77:24 was a very traditional thing that was
77:27 talked about but we all know that if a
77:30 primitive man were to see something come
77:31 out of the sky and we had no star track
77:34 in the last 200 years of fables those
77:38 things would be angels to us or
77:39 something you know Kings the dude
77:44 jean-pierre I believe I got his first
77:46 name right who discovered the tribe in
77:48 New Guinea he was told by the in the
77:53 people from Australia and New Zealand
77:56 that they think when they see a white
77:58 man that they think that you could be
78:01 either the dead or you're a God and the
78:05 funny thing was is when he was on this
78:07 weird bridge which was made
78:09 a bunch of fallen trees he's trying to
78:12 stand up on the bridge and you know
78:14 offer his hands he's showing him I know
78:15 how many weapons you know this guy's
78:16 like got a you know an arrow pointed at
78:18 his face and he's worried he's gonna get
78:20 shot but he slipped and fell he was
78:23 offering them little bags of salt as a
78:27 as a gift and he falls at one point and
78:33 drops one of his offerings he also
78:35 brought matches in a box which is like
78:37 whew it was funny watching them he
78:42 struck a match and it was lit and one of
78:44 the guys grabbed the fire and burned his
78:46 finger it was like God you know it's
78:49 kind of risky and he burned his hand
78:51 maybe he might shoot you with an arrow
78:52 ii cuz you heard him but it all went
78:55 well but if again you can conceive of
78:57 this whole alien drop-off thing where
78:59 did we take it are they responsible for
79:02 all this incredible architecture we find
79:04 around the world are they leaving behind
79:06 sort of like blueprints to inspire man's
79:10 thinking you know you leave a wall
79:12 behind I need to talk about the wall
79:14 thing too because I got off on a tangent
79:17 here I stayed on track unfortunately but
79:21 are these things left behind to teach
79:23 them how to build structural integrity
79:25 in a wall you know there's walls and
79:28 Machu Picchu where it looks like the
79:29 interlocking walls on one side looks
79:31 totally random until you realize on the
79:32 other side it's the mirror image on the
79:35 other side like down to a millimeter on
79:38 the other side once you see that you
79:40 can't unsee it and you start to think oh
79:42 my god who made this place I mean if a
79:45 man was trying to do it that is
79:46 unbelievable so I want to say because I
79:50 talked to one of our fellow deep
79:55 daughters there's this theory going
79:57 around which I need to look into that
80:01 and I so funny because I saw it online
80:04 first then he said it knows like oh my
80:06 god there's this theory again I don't
80:07 believe this for a second
80:11 mainly because of all the research but
80:14 in in South America those black walls
80:18 I'll show some pictures of them I'll put
80:20 the name of where it is in the video so
80:22 we
80:22 can shore up our notes here but they're
80:25 now saying one scientist said well if
80:27 you mix a tree sap with one of these
80:31 types of rocks it melts the rock and
80:33 then you can pour the rock in place and
80:36 then you can make it whatever shape you
80:38 want so it's not a big deal they didn't
80:40 carry these rocks they melted everything
80:42 down really really and where's the SAP
80:45 go it just falls out of the rock at some
80:47 point you know but then my buddy told me
80:52 that they're now claiming and I think
80:57 this is complete [ __ ] but I got to
80:59 figure this out if it's not I'm gonna my
81:01 mind blown that there's trying to say
81:03 that the stones in the Pyramids of Giza
81:08 were actually also poured into place
81:11 that's why there wasn't any problem with
81:13 getting them in there and they said they
81:15 found wood fibers in the limestone
81:18 outside of going to jeezum myself
81:20 personally I have seen microscopic
81:25 photographs of all of these stones in a
81:28 book called 39,000 BC there's no there's
81:33 no wood in these rocks okay maybe they
81:37 dragged wood against it there's
81:39 something and then embedded in is like
81:41 you know little nooks and crannies and
81:42 stuff but I'm pretty sure okay when I
81:46 studied my Egyptology for six solid
81:48 amazing years in the Bay Area and
81:51 interacted with you know people who were
81:54 there online this woman named Annika I
81:58 was corresponding with she was at one of
82:00 the digs that was in unrelated but she
82:05 was doing the tomb digging in the Valley
82:07 of the Kings
82:09 there are quarries that are still in mid
82:12 dig from those eras and they are digging
82:16 rocks out and coring rocks out of bigger
82:19 gigantic chunks of rock raises the whole
82:21 bedrock of the entire area but they're
82:24 chopping these rocks and they were left
82:25 there I have a screenplay based on those
82:29 rocks and so to suggest that they were
82:33 melted down and put in place well then
82:35 what are these queries for
82:36 they're everywhere we have obelisks that
82:38 have just been freshly dug out and they
82:41 haven't been able to move them and they
82:42 broke while they were moving them
82:44 because they're too big and they're all
82:45 over the police they're not just in
82:46 Egypt so his idea that rocks are melted
82:50 and moved around they were trying to see
82:52 the Coral Castle which is in coral rock
82:54 right
82:55 it's limestone it wasn't melted the
83:01 trucks didn't bring stuff and he
83:03 suddenly melts down a rock let's think
83:05 about this for one second okay 60 ton
83:09 rocks are at Coral Castle all right you
83:12 get this Mountain technique okay well
83:14 how long does it take to melt a 60 ton
83:16 rock and then how long where do you
83:19 store all this fluid and doesn't it dry
83:21 at some point and how do you pour it and
83:23 where's all the aqueducts and stuff the
83:26 tanks that can it's just absurd lazy-ass
83:30 way of dismissing all this amazing
83:33 engineering that we find all over the
83:35 world man is an amazing creature and
83:38 because we were amazing we're actually
83:39 fairly isolated in the world aren't we
83:41 you can't talk to your dog and have a
83:44 full-on conversation back yeah you can
83:46 give them little commands he understands
83:48 what's going on dogs are awesome
83:49 cats will do the same thing lots of
83:51 animals are smart very very smart course
83:54 they're smart how would they exist if
83:56 they weren't brilliant you could conquer
83:58 a predator I mean anteaters when we got
84:01 how many different anteaters are there
84:02 in the world that do all this amazing
84:05 you know digging and eating termites and
84:08 all kinds of stuff right phenomenal we
84:12 have phenomenal things all over the
84:13 planet that was octopus and squid talk
84:16 about one of the most brilliant
84:17 creatures in this planet that is so
84:18 underestimated they appear to be aliens
84:21 to me but they don't live that long but
84:24 most of them live less than a year even
84:26 a giant squid lives less than a year
84:29 it's 50 50 feet long it lives less than
84:31 a year they tell they tell me anyway let
84:35 me know what your feelings are about
84:38 evolution as much detail as you possibly
84:40 can in the comment section again we're
84:43 not looking for Loaf low hanging fruit
84:45 comments you know God just Buddha's ear
84:47 you know everybody knows that theory
84:49 save your breath
84:50 save your typing power dig deep dig deep
84:53 to tell me well one is there a giant
84:57 area of evolution I've completely missed
85:00 and you want to see the number 2 episode
85:02 because man I get super complex in that
85:05 episode but you know what what is the
85:09 fascination for you about evolution what
85:11 are the questions that I didn't pose in
85:14 this episode that still linger in your
85:16 mind about where we came from what does
85:18 it mean to you to know where we came
85:21 from you know certain religions like
85:25 Mormonism they believe that God's a man
85:27 a physical man they believe that when
85:31 you get to heaven you're gonna pick the
85:32 version of your body that you had on
85:35 earth whatever year you like and you're
85:36 just gonna stay that year until yes you
85:38 pick another year I think this is a
85:40 frailty of man that makes it really
85:42 comfortable for us to go oh yeah heavens
85:44 exactly like Earth amen maybe it is I
85:49 mean God makes us in his own image is
85:51 that an image of bones and blood and all
85:56 that stuff or is it an image of our pure
86:01 love souls that seem to strife or those
86:06 things that cannot be explained by man
86:08 you know one of the typical and it's a
86:12 tough one it's a tough one here I've got
86:15 at least half a noose left on this stick
86:17 because we know that people have tumors
86:20 in their brains and when they have
86:21 tumors in their brains sometimes it can
86:24 push on circuitry in there and we'll
86:26 have a violent killer the the Texas
86:30 shooter in a long time ago back in the
86:33 60s right he sat up there some marine I
86:35 think I don't mean to to tarnish any
86:40 division of the military but he was a
86:41 former military guy maybe it was I mean
86:44 maybe wasn't but he sat up there and he
86:46 just took shots and nobody knew where he
86:48 was and so people were dying down below
86:50 but he had a growth it was pushing on
86:52 part of his brain I can't remember what
86:54 part of it was but there's been several
86:56 of these accounts at least these claims
86:59 that that's why certain people go
87:01 violent
87:03 and so a neurologist slash atheists
87:06 might say we'll see right there his love
87:09 circuitry didn't work so if we're pure
87:11 love and all this other hippy
87:14 astrological stuff that you're talking
87:16 about then doesn't make any sense
87:17 because a little tiny growth of skin
87:19 inside the brain will neutralize your
87:21 little theory in a couple seconds maybe
87:25 someone who studies dopamine and
87:30 adrenaline effects on the mind might
87:32 simply say well your interpretation of
87:35 love is your relative definition of what
87:39 you like and what you dislike some
87:41 people like drugs some people like
87:43 people so people like things it what's
87:47 funny is is if I mean I'll just tell you
87:51 a little piece of sociology if you are
87:53 psychology perhaps that it's kind of a
87:56 sociology sociological psychological
87:58 connection people who are not hugged and
88:01 loved and given an example of love as
88:04 children typically start worshipping
88:06 possessions whether they be business
88:08 possessions like I have a big business
88:11 or they like cars and stereos and stuff
88:14 I have two people in my life that I know
88:17 quite well that are that type of person
88:19 I was very fortunate to be raised with
88:23 grandmothers who were extremely loving
88:26 got to meet great girls when I was
88:29 growing up and had girlfriends and all
88:31 that kind of stuff so I had had a really
88:33 good three-dimensional definition of
88:35 love
88:35 there wasn't any possession you know I
88:39 don't think there's a possession in my
88:41 house besides my washer/dryer they
88:43 really work well that I love you know I
88:47 mean I dig my computer it blows my mind
88:49 that I could do so many things at one
88:51 time yeah it's like a phenomenon but I
88:53 give the credit to the engineers the
88:55 human beings that actually made this
88:56 machine work it's just my style I mean
88:58 it's just the way I'm wired if you guys
89:01 can hear the raccoon in the back they're
89:03 having a little territorial fight back
89:05 there apparently they love the same
89:07 place you know I think that crying is an
89:11 amazing moment in a beings life
89:16 and we have seen every species of
89:20 primate cry over the death of usually a
89:24 newborn we've seen it with all kinds of
89:28 animals right
89:29 dogs defend their buddies in the middle
89:32 of disasters as a dog hit by a car and
89:35 his his buddy not even a relative will
89:38 sit there next to him and if you try to
89:40 come up and help his buddy
89:41 he thinks you're trying to hurt him
89:42 because man's things hurt his buddy and
89:45 sale bark at you and you know get away
89:47 from my buddy some of the most
89:49 heart-wrenching endearing things on
89:52 earth you know animals humans cried more
89:56 than any being on this planet I
89:59 guarantee it
90:00 guarantee it it's an evolutionary thing
90:03 it's part of our makeup and it's it's
90:06 really it's sort of the result of a
90:10 pinnacle amount of self-realization
90:12 isn't it if someone passes away or gets
90:17 hurt
90:19 we feel their pain we empathetically
90:22 feel it then we feel our own pain if
90:24 they're no longer on this planet whether
90:26 they died of old age or whatever we're
90:28 gonna miss their genetic input to this
90:30 world I think that's an amazing thing
90:34 again all animals seem to have this so
90:38 there seems to be this sort of common
90:40 denominator of our wiring around the
90:43 world a little fish of that you know I
90:45 tend to doubt it seems like that brain
90:47 has to get to a certain level you know
90:50 dolphins are pretty smart but their
90:51 brains are bigger than ours in the
90:53 cerebellum region I believe which is
90:55 their mechanical ability to swim so most
90:58 of their stuff is muscle memory brain
91:01 tissue but they seem to be pretty
91:02 sentient they had a lot of fun in the
91:03 ocean too right they surf waves and they
91:06 laugh and they they play with people in
91:09 the ocean right
91:10 too bad sharks aren't more like dolphins
91:12 right I guess killer whales are actually
91:15 not whales right there they're dolphins
91:16 right I was told that recently maybe one
91:20 of you guys can set me straight you know
91:22 with all these questions that we have is
91:24 man one of the things that sort of
91:27 subliminally filters around inside
91:30 mind that we usually don't articulate is
91:32 are we ever gonna find the answer in our
91:34 lifetime in our generation that's
91:38 usually sort of the the goal the desire
91:42 oh gosh if we could just figure this out
91:44 of my lifetime then when I die my death
91:46 bell go whooo know where we came from
91:49 move I know where God lives you might
91:53 find out real soon after that but I've
91:56 always thought you know and I've got
91:58 I've got stories that that answer this
92:00 question and one way or the other but
92:02 what if man gained so much sentient
92:05 knowledge about the universe and its
92:07 ecosystem of life we could prove it
92:09 somehow like I've said in so many
92:11 episodes that on our deathbed we really
92:15 honestly like some cultures do we saw it
92:18 as a journey we saw as a beginning of a
92:20 new journey we didn't fear it we no
92:24 longer for your death it doesn't mean we
92:26 don't want to die as I've said an
92:29 episode is dedicated to death I have
92:33 friends that are that it's so funny I
92:36 mean like I said I'll just update you
92:37 guys from season one you know I have at
92:40 least one close friend who's probably
92:42 he's close to an atheist as you could
92:44 possibly get he gave me a book which was
92:48 a bunch of descendants of I believe
92:49 Freud but they said in this it was a
92:51 bunch of like you know academics from
92:53 about the 20s to perhaps the 60s or 70s
92:56 and they wrote a book together and it
92:57 was just one chapter after another
92:59 treating you know scientists and their
93:01 opinions but they all were unified in
93:03 one thing which was that they said that
93:04 we any human being that doesn't fear
93:08 death feared not avoided but fear it is
93:14 lying to themselves and there are
93:17 primitive mind and there's been never a
93:20 book more in the psychological state of
93:23 projection in this book and the funny
93:27 thing is the guy gave me the book we'll
93:29 talk about death like it's no big deal
93:30 and how he wants to die you know before
93:33 he gets so old that he's you know
93:35 rocking around the crutch or walker
93:37 whatever he doesn't want to get old and
93:39 so he's telling me by giving me the book
93:42 that he's terrified of Don
93:43 and he keeps talking about how he wants
93:45 it to be he doesn't want to live a long
93:47 time I think he even joked about you
93:50 know the husband wife going out at the
93:52 same time thing on purpose
93:54 they haven't even had the grandkids yet
93:56 so relax dude relax but I think being
93:59 centered in whatever definition you have
94:01 for a creator or you can be an atheist
94:04 and also not fear God I don't know how
94:07 that works you would have to tell me but
94:09 to realize that there's you know all of
94:12 the energy of the universe whatever is
94:14 out there whether there's a substrate of
94:16 love or whatever it's out there and it
94:18 can't be hidden anywhere so your
94:20 consciousness if it is a separate entity
94:22 from your body which I think we've got
94:24 plenty of proof that's the case again
94:25 I'm at Walt Disney and Disney Land go
94:28 see angels and demons for that episode
94:31 or ghosts in demons I think it was
94:34 called but ghosts the demons you're
94:38 gonna find this center of consciousness
94:40 in the universe whether it be the whole
94:42 thing is one giant consciousness and
94:44 we're in this instance of a body that
94:45 restricts us from all knowledge thank
94:47 God but now you know to split an atom
94:52 real quick for those psychologists that
94:54 wrote that book all right so we don't
94:57 fear death let's just set you you're a
94:59 peace with your Creator your peace with
95:01 what you've accomplished in your life
95:02 you want to accomplish more and you want
95:03 to live a long life but you don't fear
95:06 death it's gonna happen when it happens
95:07 that's it
95:08 maybe it's painful maybe it's not who
95:11 knows right it doesn't mean that if
95:14 you're and some car accident or a
95:18 potential car accident or you step in
95:20 front of a bus and you miscalculated
95:23 everything or it's not even in your
95:24 control something's coming at you for
95:27 those few microseconds first time slows
95:30 down
95:30 yeah your heart rates gonna go through
95:33 the roof you were going to be afraid for
95:36 that split second that you're going to
95:37 die but you're not afraid in the way
95:40 that you know there's something bad
95:43 gonna happen to you after you die you
95:47 just don't want to die you just want to
95:49 keep living because you enjoy life it
95:51 doesn't mean you're this you know feral
95:53 little child who's like oh my god
95:56 every second of my life is to fear death
95:58 and all this other stuff you know I say
96:01 that you'll the more you accomplish in
96:03 life that is according to your goal path
96:05 and life the less and less you're going
96:07 to give a crap about dying because you
96:09 will have done everything you can do
96:12 with your life or at least you took a
96:14 big chunk out of your list of things my
96:17 hope is that you don't fear death that
96:19 you just try to avoid it evolution well
96:22 if we find our origins
96:24 maybe I mean imagine you talk to an
96:27 alien and you say did you create us and
96:29 he says yes
96:30 our ancestors greeted you or we know who
96:33 did and there they're similar to us they
96:35 live in a different place but or they
96:37 say you know we created one of you and
96:39 others came down and created the others
96:41 and we created you actually in a
96:42 different place we brought you here and
96:44 we dropped you off we picked up some
96:45 monkeys and stuff what they eat and what
96:47 they live off of because we have to
96:49 figure out what the ecosystem is of your
96:51 planet and we took them off whatever
96:52 right but then you ask the alien the
96:54 second question is there a god maybe
96:58 they understand what you're saying maybe
96:59 they don't but if they did understand
97:01 what if they just said we don't know we
97:05 don't know what if they said oh yeah
97:08 most definitely
97:08 and the whole soul thing that you guys
97:11 are struggling with that completely
97:12 exists and we orchestrate some of that
97:14 too we don't make the souls but we know
97:18 where to craft life and we know how to
97:20 get life to the point where it will
97:21 attach to a soul that's what creating
97:23 life is all about if you were
97:25 Frankenstein and you could maybe not
97:28 quite Frankenstein we chopping up other
97:29 people to make a person but you know you
97:31 could synthesize everything in some
97:33 laboratory or whatever there'd be that
97:35 connection moment where soul is gonna
97:38 fall into this ether all current that is
97:40 the mass that you're gonna be made out
97:42 of and poof you got life and it just
97:44 sort of does magic it just does it
97:46 because the soul is ultimately
97:48 intelligent and knows how to synthesize
97:50 something that can't exist maybe works
97:52 from algorithms that are local knows
97:54 where hey so anyway I think I'll stop
97:57 chit chit chat in here I hope you dug
98:00 the episode if you have a bit of deep
98:03 thoughts radio com that's where you will
98:04 find episode 2 of the evolution series
98:07 and you want to find the
98:09 master version of it because it's a
98:10 little a little less hard on the ears a
98:13 little quicker to listen to as I've
98:15 chopped out all the pausing and thinking
98:18 but we have two feeds for video one is
98:22 YouTube ones bit shoot we have two feeds
98:25 for audio which would be basically your
98:26 Android and your Mac platform and your
98:30 PC I guess you have two social media one
98:33 is Twitter don't do much just post the
98:35 Twitter just post the feed to the video
98:36 that's it I don't get involved with
98:38 Twitter it's too political it's acidic I
98:41 don't like it at all but we have our LOC
98:44 Facebook group and if you're looking for
98:45 a great place to meet super intelligent
98:47 people of all walks of life and evolve
98:50 beliefs just hopefully you're capable of
98:53 listening to people say things that you
98:55 completely don't believe and you can
98:56 laugh and have fun with everybody
98:57 then you're a perfect candidate for the
98:59 Facebook group we have two two ways to
99:02 contribute to the movement we got PayPal
99:03 which nobody uses and we use patreon
99:05 which when the season is on it swells up
99:08 pretty good pretty cool I do run ads on
99:11 these videos because I'm kind of
99:13 experimenting with sort of what the app
99:15 revenue could be what I tell you what
99:17 cuz we've had some questions about me
99:20 and the monetary thing it really goes
99:22 down to I see these amazing videos
99:25 I see videos that have nothing to do
99:27 with it with stuff we talk about I just
99:29 watched one yesterday night which was a
99:32 guy that took an old model of a Star
99:35 Destroyer one of the early models before
99:37 it became the Star Destroyer and it was
99:40 a weird one and didn't get put in the
99:42 movie verbatim but the dude is a 3d
99:46 artist and he spent some time
99:47 reengineering this thing used a few
99:49 other people to help him out he made
99:50 this thing look amazing and sexy and he
99:52 redid it and he lit it and he 3d
99:54 rendered it in space put it next to a
99:56 starter story developed this beautiful
99:58 theory in its backstory about it and
100:00 then at the this is something I'll
100:03 probably end up to him for season 5 he
100:05 lists all of his patreon and he thanked
100:08 them and he said look I don't have to
100:10 work because of you guys I get to make
100:12 these episodes and they're amazing and
100:13 so I'm watching this I'm getting envious
100:15 I'm like wow that would be awesome man
100:17 if I get spend you know every minute of
100:19 every day creating awesome episode
100:22 I mean really super well researched
100:24 episodes I got a hole I probably have 30
100:26 episode titles that I want to do that
100:29 are gonna take me I don't know two to
100:32 five days just to do the research on
100:33 them I want to do them I think you're
100:36 gonna love them
100:36 alright have a lot of fun I got to get
100:38 that kind of mobility not so you have to
100:40 do other things to make money so I'm
100:42 experimenting with that and that's the
100:44 reason why I would love to hire a few
100:45 you folks to help produce the videos to
100:47 monitor things and pay you to do it
100:50 instead of just being a volunteer and we
100:53 have some volunteers that probably have
100:54 earned a few bucks as well which I can't
100:55 give them any money so anyhow that's the
100:58 reason buying that it's not that I'm
101:00 some chili guy this show would be
101:02 entirely different if I was a shell give
101:04 me a break I'd already be making the
101:06 other thing to do is a shell makes money
101:07 that's the whole thing about a shell
101:08 right they don't work they can go all
101:10 these protests they can go to all these
101:12 conferences and carry global agendas way
101:15 nothing like that I'll tell you that
101:16 much anyway looking for suggestions to
101:20 four episodes always always open this
101:23 was a result of the same suggestion
101:25 coming through two different people I
101:26 don't know what's up on that glad it did
101:28 and here you go so in the meantime take
101:36 care of yourself in someone else and
101:37 I'll see in the next deep thoughts over
101:39 now
