00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen now today's gonna be one of
00:40 those episodes where you if you're
00:45 newcomer you may not listen to this
00:47 episode at all if you've been with the
00:49 show for a long time you know that
00:50 there's a reason for these episodes and
00:52 they're important this is a particular
00:56 topic that I have had over the last
00:58 three years come to me and it's like oh
01:01 my god this has to be done I'm gonna
01:02 have to this episode and then I can't
01:06 remember exactly how I would you know
01:08 put all the facts together such that the
01:11 feeling I'm having inside myself which
01:12 is one of them great importance could be
01:17 conveyed to you guys because part of it
01:20 just seems utterly wrong you know on
01:24 this show I always say to you that if
01:26 you're thinking a thought of truth you
01:28 have this kind of cool clean feeling
01:29 going through your body but when you
01:32 think of something that is just wrong we
01:36 are built out of truth because if we
01:38 weren't our algorithms would not work
01:39 and if we didn't work we wouldn't exist
01:41 right so the very fact that you're held
01:43 together by the universe means that you
01:46 are built out of perfectness what do we
01:52 get sick because we negate the way that
01:56 the world was balanced back in the day
01:59 you allow big giant companies to replace
02:02 our food supplies we lay ourselves to
02:05 get hooked on a bunch of things that
02:07 marketing firms say are important and we
02:10 infect our bodies we'd infect our minds
02:12 that we infect our souls and then we
02:17 either die early or we die with concerns
02:19 that we have perhaps compromised our
02:21 very integrity with the universe and the
02:26 process by which this occurs is called
02:28 trends and you know when you look back
02:32 probably the last hundred years if you
02:35 go back a hundred years to today you're
02:39 going to see this hockey stick you know
02:41 line graph where we barely had any
02:45 trends and now it is an absolute
02:47 de-facto
02:49 trans trans trans trans every single
02:52 aspect of your life is supposed to be a
02:54 trend according to the marketing firms
02:57 of today right
02:58 this can be interesting but could also
03:02 be extremely damaging and obviously
03:05 where it's interesting we should pay
03:07 attention but where it's damaging we've
03:10 got to be careful so how did trends
03:12 start well I doubt anyone really knows
03:17 the very first trend that occurred but I
03:21 think in the modern age the average
03:23 definition for last hundred years would
03:25 be something serendipitous happened for
03:26 a company by which society itself
03:29 created a trend and someone made a [ __ ]
03:33 ton of money off of it and it probably
03:37 came and went several times without
03:39 anyone really trying to manhandle the
03:44 algorithm they just say oh that was so
03:46 wild number ten years ago this happened
03:48 and this thing got really popular those
03:50 shoes that dress this hairdo
03:53 everyone who provided those services
03:55 made out like a bandit and as long as
03:58 the world is actually fairly balanced
04:00 and a single income household could pay
04:02 for everything that you need maybe you
04:05 don't pay attention because the need to
04:07 make a bunch of money isn't there but
04:10 when you're a company and the market in
04:14 which you deal this isn't all going to
04:16 be marketing necessarily you know that
04:18 the theme of this show is to rebuild
04:20 society from the ground up and this is
04:22 probably one of the most important
04:25 problems psychoses addictions that we
04:29 have as a full-blown world society but I
04:32 will tell you that this this exact
04:35 mechanism trends it's probably one of
04:38 the most life-threatening things to the
04:40 culture of your country and your people
04:43 regardless if you're a bag of a bunch of
04:45 different races or you're predominantly
04:47 one race doesn't even matter but we're
04:50 gonna get into it all but the companies
04:52 that needed cash because the market
04:55 they're in became very saturated can use
04:57 trends to survive
04:59 now a quick example would be it's 1915
05:02 it's Kansas City Kansas there's a couple
05:07 dress makers in town so there's plenty
05:09 of people to that one dress is right
05:12 very few dress makers it's one on the
05:14 western Kansas City side Kansas one on
05:17 the eastern Missouri side right but
05:20 people start noticing hey there's a lot
05:23 of money to be made making dresses and
05:25 so four or five others come up over the
05:27 next decade all right now you know the
05:31 demands going down the amount of money
05:33 these individuals make are going down
05:35 but everything's still balanced and then
05:38 ten more show up import start Shona from
05:41 New York in LA now people starting to
05:44 struggle so now the competition is to
05:47 innovate new dresses that no one else
05:50 has this has houses and so they can
05:54 create a trend maybe somewhat even
05:56 accidentally does one resurrection old
06:00 dresser brings in a new one you get them
06:02 a point but a crap-ton of dresses are
06:04 bought from one company and only one
06:05 company perhaps they have patent
06:07 protection perhaps they just honor
06:09 designs maybe they can't even copy the
06:12 dress because there's some ingredients
06:13 some some skillset that doesn't exist in
06:16 the other dress manufacturers so
06:18 everyone sees the power of the trend
06:23 they see it from the consumer side and
06:25 they also see it from the manufacturing
06:26 side well 50 years goes by and say that
06:30 particular company is really good at
06:32 that thing they can make trends that can
06:34 make the new dresses they always seem to
06:35 have the one that everyone wants and
06:37 everyone else is trying to copy the one
06:38 they did 10 years ago so you fast
06:42 forward 50 years and that company that
06:44 has all the you know trendy stuff well
06:47 they're building is like 10 stories
06:49 higher than all the other buildings of
06:51 their competitors because they can
06:52 afford it their staff is much better
06:55 paid they're famous they start exporting
06:57 around the world because they have that
07:00 trendy dress from Kansas all right so
07:04 that's sort of how could serendipitously
07:06 start once that algorithm gets in the
07:10 mind of corporations then they can straw
07:13 for it and they used the most
07:15 conspiratorial group of folks on planet
07:17 earth called marketing firms to instill
07:20 two things one to take whatever is on
07:24 deck and start demonizing it you don't
07:27 want to listen that old music you don't
07:29 know where those old dresses you know
07:30 hey we're not wearing brown anymore
07:32 right I mean you may laugh but that's
07:36 you know you've been through those
07:37 cycles yourself and so they need to find
07:41 obviously prior to the demonization of
07:43 what exists on deck they will simply
07:45 find something new they won't find
07:48 something better they will find
07:49 something new and then you have to adopt
07:53 the new thing demonize the old thing so
07:57 you can feel trendy up to date but now
08:02 how does that work how do you convince a
08:05 human being to dislike what they've been
08:07 liking for a say perhaps 10 years now
08:10 when I was a kid we loved the 70s and
08:12 loved the eighties all at the same time
08:14 was interesting but by the 90s
08:17 boy got a huge switch he had to hate the
08:19 80s other than Lenny Kravitz keeping the
08:22 70s alive you hated everything before
08:24 the stuff you were listening to but
08:28 there's a substrate to our brains that's
08:30 very very important when it comes to
08:32 trends and it has to do with your
08:34 perception of aging and hopefully this
08:37 year I'm going to do an episode with a
08:39 an acquaintance of mine who is
08:42 pioneering some really good thought
08:48 processes on this but if you start to
08:52 fear your age yeah and I travel quite a
08:57 bit these days and I see it in airports
08:59 a lot people that are 10 20 years beyond
09:03 their younger days but they are wearing
09:05 clothing that is sort of doesn't work I
09:09 mean more power to them if they want to
09:11 but they're just sucking the teat of
09:14 trends women that are trying to look
09:18 like they're 20 years old when they're
09:19 in their 60s their bodies can't fill out
09:22 the old yoga pants quite like the
09:24 granddaughter can right
09:26 the old guys that are dyeing their hair
09:29 but they can't keep up with it so they
09:32 have lots of gray popping through
09:33 constantly right what a pain in the ass
09:37 was it Lou Dobbs on Fox now he was gray
09:40 for about 10-15 years and all the sudden
09:42 he shows up with brown hair you know
09:44 we're like blue man nobody needs your
09:47 hair to be you know a youthful color
09:50 necessarily speaking but he also went
09:52 for like this really weird sour Brown
09:54 instead of like maybe go blonde dude cuz
09:56 like you were really lightheaded they
09:59 like haired you know it's like if I
10:01 showed up with black hair on this show
10:03 you'd know it would be Halloween right
10:04 there's an idea a little digression one
10:09 of the things we used to do in the game
10:10 business and software in general is that
10:12 you would do something cosmetically to
10:14 your body that you didn't want to keep
10:17 and what made you want to it but the
10:20 rule was that you'd have to finish your
10:22 project before you could actually change
10:23 this cosmetic thing about you some folks
10:26 used to grow beards and they hate beards
10:28 and so the beard gets long and gross and
10:31 they the only way they can cut it off
10:32 and their brain is to finish their
10:33 project and get a bug-free I used to dye
10:36 my hair black which I made it work a
10:39 couple times but you know I was always
10:41 eager to get back to my normal color
10:42 which was platinum way back in the 90s
10:45 but now what are the what are some of
10:49 the benefits of trends before I go for
10:51 the negative in technology it's very
10:55 very interesting
10:56 unlike the perhaps unnecessary need to
11:01 change the way that clothing is is cut
11:03 up and made okay and you know if
11:06 corporations the optimization of
11:08 clothing and and products in general
11:10 let's see how cheap you can make it what
11:12 kind of crappy materials can you make
11:14 something out of now someone might say
11:17 well we're trying to figure out what
11:18 cheaper materials we can make it out of
11:21 that are actually as strong as the
11:22 stronger materials but I think that's
11:24 very few and far between again people
11:27 still own appliances from the 30s
11:29 because they still work because they're
11:31 made out of like tank metal you know and
11:33 today if you buy a coffee maker it's 15
11:37 dollars for a coffee maker
11:39 it weighs about you know three ounces
11:41 and it's made of the cheapest plastic on
11:43 planet earth and it just happens to be a
11:45 device that is routinely associated with
11:47 burning your house down really sad right
11:50 but let's just go for computers trends
11:54 and computers have been probably one of
11:57 the most phenomenal benefits we've ever
11:59 had now I guess kind of silly you know
12:03 there was a great SNL skit with I
12:06 believe Will Ferrell where they were
12:10 talking about the new effect it was a
12:11 couple difference gets on this but it
12:13 was Apple constantly trying to make
12:14 something thinner and smaller and I
12:17 forgot which comedian did it but I
12:19 believe he did it on the news where yep
12:22 opening up a smaller and smaller phone
12:24 he was impersonating Steve Jobs it was
12:27 really funny but for those of you who
12:30 are familiar with the history of
12:31 computers you know that they used to
12:32 fill entire warehouses and they had you
12:36 know all right there's no device made
12:39 today that is as weak as the computers
12:42 that we used to fill up warehouses with
12:43 your average calculator the cheapest
12:46 calculator you could possibly buy could
12:49 probably outperform the warehouse
12:50 computers today right but now today we
12:55 have cell phones that could eclipse the
13:00 Cray computers of the early 80s and for
13:02 those of you don't know what that is
13:04 you can look it up at CR I think it's
13:05 CRA y and Cray was a brilliant engineer
13:10 that figured out that if he stacked
13:12 chips right next to each other that he
13:14 could cut down on a lot of the
13:18 microseconds that are consumed by
13:20 sending data across a bus line over a
13:22 printed circuit board and so he
13:25 literally took chips and he said you
13:26 know you've seen a chip before those
13:28 little legs on him right so instead of
13:30 connecting the chip to a PCB board and
13:32 then making it go across one those lines
13:34 over to another chip he simply put the
13:36 legs into the other leg of the next chip
13:38 making a hopscotch through chips so that
13:40 he could send data faster and it was
13:44 they were they were beautiful computers
13:46 but I heard that they are really cheap
13:48 like you they would fall apart if you
13:49 bumped into them physically but they use
13:52 those compute
13:53 to render the first computer-generated
13:56 movie Tron in 1982
13:59 now the visual effects society in Los
14:01 Angeles
14:02 I believe about 10 years ago took a
14:05 iphone s4 s and then calculated how
14:10 quickly they could render the movie Tron
14:12 on one of these telephones right it took
14:15 months and months and months on the Cray
14:17 computers and a few others like three or
14:19 four other computers that were being
14:20 used at the time but I think it was the
14:24 phone was a thousand times more powerful
14:26 than the most powerful computer of that
14:28 time and they could render the whole
14:30 movie in about 15 minutes on a phone I'm
14:33 an iPhone 4 now think about it
14:36 you went we went from warehouses to
14:39 little tiny calculators and then we we
14:43 souped up the the gigahertz you know
14:46 what two megahertz and gigahertz and now
14:49 we have multiple processors and tons of
14:51 memory and super fast storage facilities
14:54 inside our computers we have wireless
14:56 network we finally have Tesla's
14:57 invention we went from big giant
15:00 resistors to little tiny micro resistors
15:03 went from big giant tubes to printed
15:07 circuit boards to you know ASIC chips
15:10 with you know from a couple resistors on
15:13 on a circuit board to billions and
15:16 trillions of resistors and your average
15:17 processor miniaturized that's driven by
15:23 trends because there is a trend to buy
15:27 the next fastest computer more memory
15:31 more power the game's got to look better
15:33 your 3d rendering is going to render
15:36 faster trend trend trend
15:38 mmm so in that case we actually have an
15:42 interesting sort of subliminal push on
15:45 the scientific side and I think that's
15:47 something that we should probably hang
15:50 on to when it comes to trends but
15:52 perhaps there's a different wing of
15:55 thoughts when it comes to that sort of
15:57 trend so which ones are bad could there
16:02 really be a bad trend am I simply being
16:04 a subjective
16:07 narrator perhaps there is the old no
16:12 country for old men right everything
16:14 changes so much from your youth that you
16:17 feel like your country has essentially
16:18 turned against you I think is the way
16:20 that it's sort of defined but now what
16:23 is culture it was a cultural trend it's
16:29 interesting when you look at cultural
16:31 trends typically you are referencing
16:33 something that is old older than the
16:38 average 10-year trends that we have
16:40 today right the way that the world works
16:42 according to my observations of the last
16:44 3040 years is that the trends are cycled
16:47 in 10-year increments and it's always
16:49 mapped to the decade that you're in so
16:52 right when the decade turns from like a
16:54 2020 you can expect the new trends to be
16:57 debuted and takes about two or three
16:58 years to figure out where the hooks are
17:02 how the society is responding to the
17:04 trends and marketing firms that are
17:05 looking at this and then you know 2030
17:08 we're gonna get into another trend but
17:11 let's think about culture if I said
17:15 Germans Mexicans Norwegians Egyptians
17:21 and then I say the word culture most of
17:25 us with you know just a basic knowledge
17:27 of those areas of the world where these
17:29 races exist the Chinese the Japanese the
17:31 Russians you seldom think of a 10-year
17:35 trend right you don't sit there and go
17:38 oh Mexico oh yeah the really long toed
17:42 boots that are that are really popular
17:44 down there right now no you think of the
17:46 whole lineage of the Mexican race and
17:50 and the food and the culture that's down
17:53 there when you go to visit you're not
17:55 really looking for the latest trend in
17:56 Mexico you're looking for the entire
17:59 gamut of what they are right Germany
18:04 later hosen right do you think that that
18:09 just invented in one decade and that it
18:11 just became this thing that people wear
18:12 to signify traditional German culture
18:17 know took a really long time
18:20 to develop that classical music it's
18:25 it's a culture of music unto itself but
18:29 how many hundreds of years did it stay
18:32 unchanged most people don't realize this
18:36 but Bach was a hundred years before
18:39 Mozart but in our brains you know we
18:42 hear them all together in school and we
18:43 think it all goes together I used to
18:44 think Beethoven was before Bach because
18:47 he's so chunky in his writing style
18:50 right now he was after Mozart man so
18:56 what holds a particular society together
18:58 I think culture I think it holds you
19:04 together and it establishes principles
19:05 by which your country and your people
19:07 operate and there's a little bit of
19:11 competition I think between countries to
19:14 prove that their culture is more
19:16 developed that their people are more
19:18 principled intelligent kind and caring
19:22 in most cases right when you watch old
19:27 f1 racing back in the day you had you
19:31 know the Italian cars going against the
19:32 French cars going against the Norwegian
19:34 cars against the American cars or their
19:36 British cars and it was the car was the
19:38 byproduct of all this the sum of
19:40 engineering and education that you could
19:42 get out of those countries on top of
19:45 that they tried to make him look sexy
19:47 of course now everything's standardized
19:50 but it was interesting the benefits to
19:54 the people the pride and the care and
19:56 once you saw you know some Italian car
19:59 drive up and your cars is damn good but
20:02 it's not as refined as the Italian car
20:04 guess what happens you go home to your
20:07 culture and you know those Italians they
20:09 polish it way more than we do you know
20:13 some guy might come in from the
20:14 mechanic's side of things and goes yeah
20:15 but their gearboxes [ __ ] you know we've
20:18 got that worked out so hey team cosmetic
20:20 team refinement team you need up your
20:24 game we'll continue making the best
20:26 engines and of course the inverse
20:27 conversation might be going on in Italy
20:29 but what fuels a good trend
20:33 a good culture just those are two
20:36 different things but what I just told
20:39 you in the f1 racing example and I
20:42 apologize ladies if that bores the hell
20:43 out of you just think fancy cars racing
20:46 each other is that that combines
20:49 intelligence and art together it is a
20:53 reflection of your countries or regions
20:55 educational prowess and it also talks
21:00 and speaks to the artistic refinement of
21:04 the right brain now probably going to
21:07 touch on they knew the the pyramid code
21:10 which is an old documentary that was on
21:13 on YouTube which has now been refreshed
21:18 for Netflix because it relates to
21:21 culture and it relates to trends and it
21:23 relates to the lineage of a people that
21:26 kept that basically developed their
21:29 religion their methodology their
21:31 mathematics their science and their
21:33 culture over thousands and thousands of
21:37 years holding on to everything that they
21:40 had built up over time one of the things
21:43 that they believed in heavily the
21:45 Egyptians which is only recently being
21:47 documented because I will tell you until
21:49 the 21st century our knowledge of Egypt
21:51 is almost categorically a hundred
21:54 percent wrong and I mean every single
21:58 aspect of it including the translations
22:00 of the hieroglyphs without the acronym
22:02 boost to the interpolation of what
22:05 they're saying but they believe that the
22:08 woman was born with an all-powerful
22:10 right brain and the male was born with
22:12 an all-powerful left brain and over the
22:14 course of their life one is supposed to
22:16 teach the other their hemisphere of
22:19 thought and full enlightenment was
22:21 having both sides of their brain
22:22 functioning perfectly why mention that I
22:26 want to start getting your brain
22:28 thinking the trends need to be built out
22:32 of a minimum set of components meaning
22:36 it needs more than just a new color on
22:40 your t-shirt it needs more than just a
22:43 new sort of way that way dab in metal
22:47 the next car that you buy I think a
22:50 trend in all circumstances should be a
22:52 literal upgrade such that if you walked
22:55 into a court of law and had to prove
22:57 that you should be into this trend that
23:02 you should be selling your clothing in
23:04 all of your possessions so you can
23:05 replace them with the next iteration of
23:07 the next trend and I'm being a little
23:09 facetious here but what if you had to
23:12 walk into a court of law and prove that
23:14 your new trend was an improvement over
23:17 the previous trend you had to prove it I
23:20 had to prove it in some metric of either
23:23 left brain or right brain discipline
23:26 maybe you for an example are wearing
23:29 jeans let's say in the mid-1800s and you
23:35 want to move up to Levi's which started
23:37 using rivets to hold the jeans together
23:39 and you went into a court of law and you
23:41 said look I want to move up to Levi's
23:43 jeans because I'm a miner and I noticed
23:46 that as they bump things and and stretch
23:48 and twist my clothing they tend to fall
23:50 apart but I took a rivet gun and I
23:52 riveted a couple loose ends together and
23:55 my god if they didn't just hold together
23:56 great so it's not just simply to put
23:59 rivets on my clothing it's to hold my
24:01 clothing together better and the judge
24:02 slings a gal will boom you're ready to
24:05 go
24:05 approved someone who's worshipping Bach
24:10 just before Mozart takes off and he
24:13 comes in he wants to pitch Mozart and he
24:14 says look I really like Bach but he's
24:17 very mathematical I think most of us
24:19 know how to play music now we know the
24:20 structure of music which is one of the
24:22 big trends of the way that Bach wrote
24:23 was to teach his kids how to play but I
24:28 want to get into the emotional spirit
24:30 and I've got this new way of writing
24:33 music or Mozart's got this new way of
24:34 writing music whereby every instrument
24:36 is like an animal in the forest and in
24:39 its it's this this instrument here is
24:42 literally the heartstrings of my lover
24:44 of my own despair I want to I want to
24:47 have this you know beautiful array of
24:49 palette to paint emotions into the mind
24:52 of man and they prove it because there's
24:56 an upgrade now let's look at today
25:00 for those of you haven't discovered the
25:01 rapper Hopson Hopa si in he is a I would
25:07 say the the second tier of Hopson which
25:10 is where he's really become extremely
25:12 popular he is and I haven't seen
25:15 everything he's ever done so I can't
25:16 vouch for every word he's ever spoken
25:18 but lately the last two to three years
25:21 he has been just a beautiful philosopher
25:26 of our time and he's funny and he's and
25:30 he's intelligent but he has a song that
25:34 just came out well I just saw it for the
25:37 first time it's called no words and it's
25:39 about a minute and about two minutes
25:41 long his complain about a hip hop is
25:44 that he got in because he wanted to be a
25:46 rapper and he copied all of the acidic
25:48 formulas of rap in the 90s you know
25:50 drugs sex you know degrading of women
25:55 and all this other kind of stuff and
25:56 then he finally woke up and said I can't
25:58 do this anymore and so no words is a
26:02 funny rap he did just recently where he
26:04 said you know these guys are creating
26:07 [ __ ] music they're auto-tuning
26:09 themselves and reverb being the
26:11 auto-tune such that they don't have to
26:12 speak English they never have to speak a
26:14 word and you'll buy it as if they're
26:17 saying something profound and of course
26:18 that he says oh man that was so hard
26:22 that was so hard to make that rap but he
26:24 makes it complete rap song would be like
26:26 one minute long of just gibberish
26:28 but then he shoots the video with all
26:31 these hot women and gold-plated joints
26:34 and you know cars and parts champagne
26:36 all over people's bodies and stuff just
26:38 exactly like all the raps that are out
26:39 there and he's trying to break the trend
26:42 to say look we need to have some
26:46 qualifications to what we do and he's
26:50 always promised that you'll always be
26:52 able to understand the words of any one
26:54 of his raps they'll never talk so fast
26:57 or so mumbly that you won't be able to
27:00 understand what he's saying because he
27:01 goes I got a message and I want you to
27:03 hear the message and so Hobson is an
27:07 absolute de facto upgrade moment for
27:10 hip-hop in the 21st century
27:13 I mean there's a demarcation line and
27:16 that dude poured the sand you know or
27:19 drew the line in the sand so what are
27:22 the other defects of it well imagine
27:25 that you have just acquired stuff let's
27:28 say you're young let's say you got out
27:29 of the house at 18 for whatever reason
27:32 you either went to college or you got
27:34 off on your own even if you got off with
27:35 now and you're about four years ahead of
27:36 the other kids in terms of getting your
27:38 own place and getting your own furniture
27:40 but you slave for ten years roughly
27:44 between 20 and 30 to get your stuff a
27:47 sofa a bed and a chair TV whatever but
27:51 by the time you hit 31 well some decade
27:54 has rolled over in that timeframe and so
27:58 now you're supposed to upgrade because
28:03 everything you got is now been deemed by
28:05 a marketing firm both in the eyes of the
28:08 [ __ ] marketing firm that's simply
28:10 trying to sell the next product but also
28:12 in your girlfriend your boyfriend your
28:14 friends they're supposed to look down on
28:17 you now
28:18 because you have the old thing you only
28:21 have a 1080p screen you don't have a 4k
28:23 screen now sometimes these upgrades are
28:27 upgrades they're things that you might
28:29 go well yeah you know I waited 10 years
28:31 to upgrade my TV but then I there was a
28:34 distinct again technical improvement
28:36 between 1080p and 4k I love my movies
28:38 and I love my my cell phone videos I
28:41 take with my family and I want to see
28:42 them they're filmed in 4k so I want to
28:44 see them in 4k maybe that makes more
28:46 sense right but imagine someone
28:49 infecting your brain to make you feel
28:51 obsolete every 10 years but everything
28:53 that you own your clothing your shoes
28:56 your hair everything
29:02 they can get kind of dangerous
29:04 financially right how are you ever
29:05 supposed to get ahead if you have to
29:07 constantly upgrade constantly right
29:10 I bought a Mitsubishi Eclipse in 1993
29:14 December walked onto a lot my previous
29:18 girlfriend had one I loved it
29:21 then we broke up and I was like God one
29:23 of those things too so I went in and I
29:24 bought one and I drove it for 15 years
29:30 at one point I was making $200,000 a
29:33 year driving a 93 Eclipse it was seven
29:39 or eight years old at the time by doper
29:41 for 15 years I literally drove it until
29:43 the engines started locking up but I was
29:45 making tons of money and people would
29:48 see me with this car and it looks it
29:50 looks you know I kept it looking
29:52 beautiful I still have it and they were
29:56 confused and I said well I understand
30:01 there's really beautiful cars out there
30:03 but I bought this car cuz I like it
30:05 now once you come over to my house and
30:07 I'll show you my $80,000 music studio
30:11 and when that car has already delivered
30:14 me from point A to point B which is a
30:16 very short period of time traveling
30:18 because I only worked about five or ten
30:19 minutes from work at any point in time
30:20 so I'm only in the car every once in a
30:23 while but I spent hours and hours and
30:27 hours months and years making music
30:29 offering my services to like offering my
30:32 instruments to other musicians that
30:34 wanted to use them as well I had more
30:38 fun saving money and not buying into the
30:40 trend of needing a new car I even got
30:43 into the I almost bought a Lincoln
30:44 Navigator at one point and I started
30:47 doing the math on it and I said you know
30:48 I got the money I like I probably paid
30:50 cash for this thing but it's just not
30:53 worth it the amount of instruments I
30:55 could get or art supplies I could get or
30:57 computers computer processing power you
31:00 get to learn something new
31:01 so eclipse the value of the car I never
31:04 got into it I want you guys to be able
31:07 to control your mind as the pressures
31:09 come on and off to change and become
31:12 full of trends
31:15 but now there is a there's sort of an
31:19 overlay to the soul theory and the
31:22 trends usually require the elapse of
31:26 time to to be recognized in the minds of
31:29 man now what does that mean well I'm 49
31:34 years old so I've had four pretty decent
31:39 decades probably again waking up around
31:41 seven years old
31:42 well my time is just fully linear
31:44 remember the rest of my life so every 10
31:48 years I've seen it I've seen it in every
31:51 industry that I've paid attention to
31:53 I've even profited probably from a
31:55 change in music style or what-have-you
31:56 but now when you're young you go up into
32:00 trends you don't even know where the
32:02 trend is at 10 years old you might feel
32:05 it but you it's more subconscious I know
32:09 a bunch of teenagers there in my
32:11 neighborhood they're my friends kids
32:13 they listen to music that I think is
32:16 complete [ __ ] I mean the worst duck
32:21 [ __ ] in the world right if you had to go
32:22 in a court of law and prove that it was
32:23 music you probably would lose your case
32:26 right but they've grown up into the
32:30 trend
32:31 it was simply there when they arrived
32:34 but as an adult or as someone I mean I
32:38 guess you'd be an adult but as someone
32:40 who grew up in different eras different
32:44 trends and the fact that the arts of
32:47 America and the world was much higher
32:50 3040 years ago we can see with our naked
32:54 eye how bad and bad the music is today
32:57 how auto-tuned it is how and how the
32:59 lyrics basically make no points
33:03 whatsoever right so the caveman
33:07 algorithm of man likes girl is pretty
33:10 much most of the lyrics today so if
33:13 you're if you're looking at your kids or
33:16 kids in general liking things that you
33:18 don't like and you can see that before
33:20 and after degradation of that particular
33:22 thing we have to cut them a little bit
33:25 of a blank check because they don't
33:26 understand the algorithm what
33:28 ever hopefully they do and hopefully
33:30 since music is hit rock [ __ ] bottom
33:34 recently the only place you can go from
33:36 there is up right and I think that
33:38 that's starting to happen like I say all
33:40 the time on the show I'm watching 14
33:42 year old girls shred guitar is like
33:44 Yngwie Malmsteen I mean it's it's unreal
33:47 where we're going I think it's going to
33:48 be a great great musical error in about
33:52 10 years we're gonna be hopefully with
33:55 our jaws on the ground because these
33:56 kids start to really figure out music
33:59 but hopefully they're doing more than
34:00 just mimicking old guitar solos
34:03 hopefully there's some kids out there
34:05 they're gonna be lead singers that look
34:07 at old lyrics and realize that metaphor
34:09 is all about and talk about the
34:10 struggles that they're going through and
34:12 what have you right one of the scenarios
34:16 that just turns my stomach is the notion
34:19 that there would be a marketing team
34:22 that comes together and they are being
34:26 tasked with generating the next trend
34:28 for their industry and again you know I
34:30 don't I don't have anything against them
34:31 personally they're trying to create a
34:33 reason for you to buy their products
34:34 right Apple's whole thing about face
34:37 recognition and you know thinness and
34:40 blah blah blah you know it's just trying
34:43 to make you care about something trying
34:44 to make you feel like you need something
34:45 you don't need right we've been making
34:48 phone calls since the phone was invented
34:49 and you know at no point in the 80s or
34:53 70s did anyone say oh my god you know my
34:57 life would have been so much better but
34:58 I couldn't make that phone call there
35:02 was no problem there's a payphone
35:03 outside you had a phone at your house
35:07 big deal and of course there been
35:10 emergency situations where cell phones
35:12 were very very helpful so you know it's
35:15 not a bad thing that cell phones exist
35:17 but the idea that a firm gets together
35:19 sits down and events a trend that no one
35:22 needs especially one of those really
35:24 just stupid ones and then society just
35:29 falls in place right because no one is
35:31 thinking for themselves on average in
35:33 this world now hopefully that's changing
35:35 in the great awakening of 2018 is
35:37 playing a big role and everyone kind of
35:41 going
35:41 where the hell am I what I have on what
35:45 am i driving what's the [ __ ] in my house
35:46 I don't need any of this crap again I'll
35:51 mention it several times throughout the
35:53 entire show I should say a season with
35:57 the movie branded is probably one of the
36:00 best examples of how this works it's a
36:03 fictional movie about aliens and a bunch
36:06 of other stuff but there is a very human
36:08 aspect of the marketing side of this
36:13 thing it's about a guy who's a he's a
36:14 master marketing whiz and he eventually
36:17 gets he just succeeds every every place
36:19 he goes
36:20 eventually retires out of it getting
36:23 disgusted with it and then something is
36:26 revealed about the human nature of
36:29 addiction and lust for things and he
36:33 comes back to the to the industry and
36:36 basically discovers that there's aliens
36:38 involved with our lust patterns and they
36:41 feed off of our lust but before this
36:43 there's a meeting where they try to
36:46 convince well they basically meet with
36:48 all of these corporate heads of
36:50 fast-food companies and what have you
36:51 and this guy says we're going to sell
36:55 the concept of being fat to the world
36:59 this is like this movies at least 10
37:00 years old maybe even more and they ended
37:05 up doing it they sell fat to the world
37:07 and if you think about it today god
37:09 bless you if you're overweight I
37:10 understand the struggle there but today
37:13 they are trying to pitch two things at
37:16 once
37:16 and this is where it gets really really
37:18 interesting and the cognitive dissidence
37:20 algorithm in the brain again your
37:22 ability to deny something that you know
37:24 is true starts getting into that
37:28 doublespeak thing where you can [ __ ]
37:30 yourself one side of your mouths going
37:32 well my other side's going the other way
37:33 anyone who's ever struggled with
37:35 addiction and had any awareness of their
37:38 addiction they know exactly what this is
37:40 like they know they shouldn't drink what
37:42 they drink you may be the liver is about
37:44 to pop or something right but on one
37:47 side of the liberal agenda of the left
37:49 they're trying to sell obesity
37:52 right full insanity we're not talking
37:56 about big-boned girls cuz they're out
37:57 there and they're beautiful and that's
37:59 the way they should be and guys are the
38:02 same way but guys don't ever get that
38:03 much crap for being husky but girls you
38:06 know second they don't you know have the
38:08 shape of being 22 years old all of a
38:11 sudden to that degree they are defective
38:12 in the eyes of society rate but obesity
38:16 is probably one of the most
38:18 well-documented
38:19 reasons for being unhealthy severe organ
38:23 string severe joint strain even those
38:27 that are naturally big will sometimes
38:29 develop these these problems talk to any
38:31 NBA guy over seven feet he has joint
38:34 pains that no one else has I mean you
38:36 might have your own joint pains this
38:38 dude has more ask Andre the Giant who
38:40 literally died of being gigantic his was
38:43 a growth pattern issue right and the
38:46 flipside of the liberal left agenda
38:48 extreme left right now we should be in
38:51 that [ __ ] group you can be left all
38:53 you want but extreme left is it's crazy
38:55 but the other extreme leftist agenda is
38:59 veganism you know I suppose deep meat
39:04 you're not supposed to eat [ __ ]
39:05 anything it's healthy for you right and
39:08 what ends up happening in is especially
39:09 with the friends that I have seen go
39:11 through this cycle is that they were
39:13 overweight they were eating really badly
39:15 and they went vegan and they went
39:19 through a very important detox that
39:21 needed to occur in their body and all of
39:23 a sudden they feel amazing they stopped
39:25 putting ten pounds of sugar in their
39:26 body they stopped over eating red meat
39:29 because they don't need any and there's
39:31 a purge that occurs and again there's
39:34 this huge uptick now their thighs don't
39:36 touch so much they can go run and jog
39:38 and and jump things that they never
39:40 could do maybe they got off the sofa for
39:41 the very first time in ten years and so
39:45 they go this veganism stuff is the best
39:46 vegetarianism itself is the best but
39:50 then over time they start losing the
39:54 thickness of their skin you ladies who
39:57 have sunken you see those leaves with
39:59 the sunken eye sockets because they've
40:00 lost all of the fat and their eyeballs
40:02 because it'll eat it anymore you never
40:05 get that
40:06 layer back ladies you could have it
40:07 injected but it'll just go right back
40:09 into your bloodstream now there's a
40:11 movement of anti veganism as a channel
40:14 that's dedicated to it on YouTube a guy
40:16 just interviews people he doesn't even
40:17 really ask any questions he just puts
40:18 them up there and says tell your story
40:21 what you were and you might think well
40:23 these are dumb vegans who did it wrong
40:25 no he has women up there that were
40:28 married to men that were vegan
40:30 specialists that once they're like five
40:33 extremely super disciplined versions of
40:36 veganism all their kids were constantly
40:39 sick and the second time others finally
40:42 said you know what and you Mother's I
40:44 love you guys when you have children
40:46 there's just nothing more amazing than
40:48 when a woman has a child and really
40:51 takes it seriously and she protects her
40:53 child and I'm not talking about the
40:55 Munchausen by proxy but they do a really
40:58 good job and they realize the food
41:00 they're eating sucks
41:01 they start getting rid of like these
41:02 super sugared cereals they stop feeding
41:05 their kids all this crap but this woman
41:08 got out of veganism and noticed all of
41:09 our children got immediately healthy
41:11 their scores in school when I'm they
41:13 went from being inside all the time and
41:15 sick and just like you know there's poor
41:18 kids that are just they believe they're
41:19 sick all the time so they are they went
41:21 out and played you know imagine that
41:24 you've never played a game with other
41:25 kids and now you're not only playing but
41:27 you're one of the best players out there
41:30 you need healthy nutrition for your
41:32 brain if I was SuperDuper starving to
41:36 death I can't do these episodes my I
41:39 have no energy my thought processes
41:41 don't connect properly but now what is
41:47 veganism what is vegetarianism
41:49 it's a [ __ ] trend that's what it is
41:52 they'll say that people eat red meat are
41:54 very aggressive okay it's called we're
41:58 aware that we're being [ __ ] 24/7 when
42:01 you're a vegetarian or a vegan you have
42:04 so little nutrition in your body at any
42:06 one point in time that you're docile
42:08 you're weak you're complicit when
42:12 someone wants to pass a bunch of laws
42:14 that take away all of your rights okay
42:18 I guess that's good you know the
42:21 meat-eating people are sitting there
42:22 going what did you say you know I'm
42:27 about to kick your ass
42:28 is that what's about to happen here
42:30 because that's how this country of
42:32 America was one you know sorry for the
42:35 digression but now let's look at trends
42:38 from a different perspective of what if
42:40 trends didn't occur what ends up
42:42 happening we have examples of exactly
42:47 how this happens I think classical music
42:48 is the one I referenced the most what
42:51 classical music comes on anywhere in the
42:54 world like the Masters right the one
42:58 thing you don't hear very often and I
43:01 would say this is relegated to mature
43:04 adults is you usually don't hear people
43:07 sit at a party or something with any
43:10 level of intelligent people in the room
43:12 and they make fun of it they don't sit
43:17 around and tell you how Bach was a hack
43:19 or Mozart was just some punk-ass kid
43:23 making music you don't hear that that
43:25 often do you I once heard at my doctor
43:30 gray my old teacher and drama
43:32 he once said you know you never ever
43:36 ever insult Shakespeare aka probably
43:40 Francis Bacon because to do so removes
43:44 all doubt that you have no concept of
43:46 what you're talking about now I just
43:48 grew up from the 70s up right so I can
43:51 say that what if the 70s rock and roll
43:55 continued for a really long time say a
43:59 hundred years and Led Zeppelin just kept
44:02 getting better and better and better and
44:04 their records never ceased to sail well
44:07 they probably didn't anyway but you know
44:10 they they didn't feel the need to put
44:12 keyboards in their music because the 80s
44:14 started doing that right look at Van
44:17 Halen Van Halen is well known for
44:21 starting out a rock and roll band and
44:22 sort of ending up this silly synth band
44:25 you know with songs like jump what was
44:29 that keyboards were in
44:32 Motley Crue's music after a while
44:34 because it just became a trend and they
44:36 they moved into every single 80's rock
44:38 band in the 80s and said you got to put
44:40 a keyboard in there like why cuz Pat
44:41 Benatar is doing it what yeah it sells
44:45 more music we got to put keyboards in
44:46 this thing right they're like we don't
44:50 want to put that crap in our music we
44:52 make hardcore Top Fuel rock and roll we
44:56 don't want to put this crap in there
44:58 they came to these bands that said you
45:00 got to dress like girls what do you mean
45:03 we just want to make like Led Zeppelin
45:06 did dress up like girls why don't we
45:09 have to dress up like girls cuz that's
45:10 the new thing you know with Motley Crue
45:13 they kind of made kind of a iteration of
45:15 kiss paint you know they were sort of
45:17 like a tribal Native American devil
45:19 worshipping guys right hurah hurah
45:22 butBut what how did the the whole trend
45:25 of the eighties glam metal end it ends
45:27 it with poison poison he walked onto the
45:30 set it was like how much like a girl
45:33 could you possibly make yourself look
45:35 from a hair to fly makeup to everything
45:38 goofy little tracks I mean god bless
45:40 them you know we have those for those of
45:42 us grew up in those eras some of those
45:44 songs are part of our our personal
45:46 history our own personal lives right but
45:49 the the Nugget of what we remember is
45:51 what we did with our life's not
45:52 necessarily the music that just happened
45:54 to serenade the moment but what if these
45:57 trends hung on how do we get this trend
46:02 that everything falls apart because
46:06 there was a change imposed on society
46:10 what is a factory constantly clip the
46:16 quality of what they do but as sort of
46:19 two sides to it for the Lehman's
46:21 response it's well to make the product
46:23 cheaper to increase their profits to
46:25 then reinforce their stock dividends and
46:28 they look good on Wall Street again
46:31 something that really is sort of an
46:32 ancillary thing to making a good product
46:35 but the real technical side of
46:37 manufacturing is to say well the
46:39 machines that used to make this old
46:41 thing we had to retire them because we
46:44 had to up
46:46 to the new thing so these machines are
46:48 really expensive to make
46:50 you know Electrolux vacuum cleaner right
46:54 at some point a certain amount of
46:57 suction is all you need to get this [ __ ]
46:59 off your carpet right you don't need to
47:01 innovate suction but they do they
47:05 innovate the body of the unit and of
47:08 course again you know you get your your
47:10 bagless vacuum cleaners now thank God
47:12 right but isn't it doesn't have to
47:15 happen as quickly as it does does it but
47:19 let me give you a contrast in case you
47:20 don't agree with that because the
47:23 manufacturing assembly lines the
47:24 automation that makes it really really
47:26 profitable had to be rebuilt for
47:28 everything from blenders to everything
47:30 how car you know assembly lines work
47:34 there are companies like hostess Oreo
47:39 Hershey and they've been making the same
47:42 thing again we know that they've
47:44 upgraded recently and a bunch of shitty
47:45 ingredients because the goal is to
47:48 poison the living crap out of all of our
47:50 kids right but a lot of these candy
47:52 makers can have the same exact assembly
47:55 line for 40 to 80 years now obviously at
47:59 some point the machines regardless of
48:01 how great they are will break down and
48:02 why not use modern technology to rebuild
48:05 them but those assembly lines were able
48:08 to stay the same and we didn't complain
48:10 when the Oreo cookie tasted like it did
48:11 back in the 70s did we in fact any type
48:15 of modification to these cookies or the
48:16 are the chocolate my god the chocolate
48:19 tastes like [ __ ] these days but it used
48:21 to be amazing
48:22 so at the same time we will back up and
48:25 reinforce the need for this reinvention
48:28 of every single product that exists we
48:33 also like things that don't change at
48:35 all what if you I mean imagine
48:39 coca-cola back in the 80s created new
48:42 coke and god it was awful we didn't want
48:46 it to change we resisted we said get
48:48 back the original recipe stop this idea
48:51 that a trend went all the way down to
48:54 the actual formula of coca-cola you felt
48:57 like you needed to do it now of course a
48:59 lot of those are
48:59 just scams right I hop the International
49:02 House of Pancakes changed its name to I
49:05 was a I hobb International House of
49:08 burgers or something as a little gimmick
49:11 and everyone is now so relieved they're
49:14 back to IHOP that they're now eating at
49:15 IHOP boy okay I can't believe they're
49:17 gonna do that thing we we showed them
49:19 eat the pancake eat the pancake really
49:21 hilarious right
49:22 brilliant those aren't necessarily
49:25 trends those are little tricks they play
49:27 on us to have some fun but now what
49:31 about pattern fatigue pattern fatigue is
49:34 a gigantic element that has taught it to
49:37 mankind and perhaps there's some
49:41 biological reality to it but I don't
49:43 know what is pattern fatigue well would
49:48 you like it if the Corvette stayed the
49:51 same for 20 more years like they did in
49:54 the 80s and 90s I've voiced my my
49:58 frustration did that actually occurred
50:01 previous episodes and they can season
50:03 one the episode is called American Way
50:06 but it was frustrating to me the car was
50:10 reinvented the prototypes went out in 83
50:13 you could buy it in 84 I believe and it
50:16 just stayed the same I mean yeah a
50:18 little headlight taillight change here
50:20 and there but overall the car was just
50:22 an absolute bore 20 years later and you
50:26 know what's really strange about that is
50:27 that people still buy 57 Chevys they
50:30 still buy sixty-five cobras we still buy
50:34 the old cars but now isn't that an
50:36 anomaly in our brains where we say
50:38 everything has to be new and upgraded
50:40 and change the Lexus has got to change
50:42 and yet people buy classic vehicles we
50:47 get tired of our old clothing but now
50:51 how does it really affect us personally
50:53 right and my experience it goes like
50:56 this and you guys you're gonna laugh
50:58 your ass off some of you guys are trend
51:01 or so you you'll get this from the other
51:04 side of the game but someone will in in
51:08 your life be a really trendy person I
51:11 mean they've got to buy new
51:13 knew everything constantly right you
51:16 know the iPhone comes out the new one
51:18 comes out and they literally get rid of
51:19 the phone it's almost you know almost a
51:21 year old they got to get rid of it and
51:23 get get the new one but if you have a
51:25 boyfriend or girlfriend or a partner or
51:27 a friend who is a trendy person the
51:32 virus spreads like a pathogen they get
51:35 in your life either with a new item or
51:37 with sort of a passive criticism of what
51:40 you have if you have a boyfriend or
51:43 girlfriend they can really get up in
51:44 your business right now you still have
51:47 that old thing guys you need this new
51:49 thing some people I've even heard my god
51:52 I've heard people say you know they
51:54 wouldn't date their boyfriend a
51:56 girlfriend
51:57 usually it's the boyfriend that gets the
51:59 butt of the whole thing but you know he
52:01 doesn't drive a fancy enough car to be
52:04 attractive as a human being now I know
52:07 what most of you are saying you have
52:08 principles and integrity like well that
52:09 person's a piece of [ __ ] don't date them
52:11 and you're not wrong in my opinion
52:13 but isn't it sad that other but other
52:16 other than the trend that has infected
52:18 their mind like a virus perhaps they
52:20 were a good person but because they're
52:23 impressionable they're smart and they're
52:26 not intelligent they don't think for
52:27 themselves they're gonna be subject to
52:31 this their whole life never being able
52:34 to have a decent relationship with
52:36 someone who has any level of integrity
52:38 any principle they suffer peer pressure
52:41 like crazy
52:43 and they're always persecuting those
52:45 around them they have all the latest
52:47 items but not a single lick of love
52:49 right
52:50 they have everything that's supposed to
52:52 make you happy but they're miserable
52:54 because they have no social interaction
52:57 every time that iPhone used to come on
52:59 sale used to be that big line out front
53:01 right I can pretty much tell you that
53:04 you just go down that line and those are
53:06 a bunch of people that suffer from this
53:08 condition and believe me Apple marketing
53:12 understands that they have actually
53:14 latched into the cheek with a big hook
53:18 of marketing and to all of their
53:20 impressionable snowflakes that this
53:23 stuff is that important yes you should
53:26 pitch at in in front of
53:27 Apple stores which doesn't happen
53:29 anymore for two days you can be the LAT
53:32 first one to walk out with an iPhone so
53:34 you could be the big dick who walks
53:35 around going I got the new one you don't
53:38 you know you just go down two days later
53:40 and I got the same thing dude I didn't
53:42 have to sit out like some doof ball in
53:45 front of a retail store trends are at
53:48 the heart of worshipping stuff trends
53:52 are at the heart of believing that stuff
53:53 is gonna make you happy
53:55 now there's some strategic resources in
53:58 the world that if you get quality
53:59 products that are definitely truth to
54:01 that if you're a big commuter you should
54:03 probably have a really good car if you
54:05 have a big family it's probably probably
54:07 important that you have a house that can
54:08 handle the load right so we're not
54:12 demonizing owning quality products if
54:14 anything get quality project products
54:16 save up spend more and then keep that
54:19 product for it expense extended period
54:21 of time
54:22 but let me just mention it again I just
54:24 mentioned it in an episode I can't
54:26 remember which one a couple couple back
54:28 that my my most wealthy friends in the
54:33 world who are really happy you go to
54:37 their normal houses I mean you know I
54:39 have a couple friends that have you know
54:40 multi-million dollar homes that even in
54:43 LA you're like damn that's a nice house
54:44 but you go inside and it's not stuff
54:49 were shipping they have quality products
54:51 I have one friend of mine he's probably
54:53 got furniture that spans 50 years
54:57 Barcelona chairs and wild leather sofas
55:00 from the 70s that there's just such high
55:04 quality products that there's no need to
55:06 replace them it took them you know
55:09 probably ten years into flat televisions
55:11 to get rid of their CRTs they don't
55:14 worship stuff they like stuff they'd
55:18 like to have nice stuff but they don't
55:20 get up in the morning and stretch and go
55:22 oh my god I'm so glad of that car in the
55:24 in the front you know driveway so why go
55:29 on and on about the trend thing most of
55:32 you would agree with me
55:33 that money is probably the biggest
55:36 control factor in the world
55:39 the controls are happy
55:41 to a degree now again you need a minimum
55:45 amount of money just to simply keep the
55:46 lights on and keep your your house over
55:49 your head and get from point A to point
55:50 B but beyond that it's all just gravy
55:55 right for those of you who acknowledge
55:57 savings accounts you'll understand
56:00 without extra money at the end of the
56:02 month
56:03 you simply can't save anything at all
56:06 well we're in the age of the micro
56:08 transactions your cell phone is a huge
56:14 negative force on all of your money
56:16 depending on how much you engage it
56:18 because it's $2 they're $0.99 they're
56:21 well jeez I can I can afford $0.99 I
56:24 mean think about how much I paid for my
56:26 last coffee six bucks or something right
56:29 I want you to control your brain I want
56:33 you to control what you're addicted to
56:35 can you imagine if we were going for
56:38 world peace in this planet and you're
56:41 like well we have a machine and it's
56:43 only gonna work one time and we're gonna
56:45 push this button and everyone in the
56:47 whole world is gonna get one thought it
56:50 will never work again in fact it's this
56:51 invention that an alien dropped off God
56:54 dropped it off but now we have to sit
56:57 around and philosophize at a table what
57:00 would that thought be I got a jackhammer
57:03 a helicopter and a [ __ ] jet flying
57:06 over my house Jesus Christ
57:09 where's the [ __ ] ice-cream man he's
57:13 late I think one of the thoughts that we
57:16 could put into man to really stop the
57:18 entire world's insanity would be don't
57:21 let other people tell you what to think
57:23 about anything I think about it it would
57:27 neutralize religion it would neutralize
57:29 hatred and consequently I think it would
57:33 neutralize the the marketing strength of
57:39 companies that are simply peddling
57:41 products that you don't need now the
57:44 only catch-22 that comes with this whole
57:46 trend thing is sort of in the area of
57:50 growing up because you can have people
57:53 that hang on to their
57:55 lessons for a really long time to their
57:57 detriment because they can't engage say
58:00 professionals and a company which is
58:03 required for them to continue to be
58:05 employed and so they they seem immature
58:09 I have probably criticized at least once
58:12 on the show and several times in my
58:14 lifetime when Facebook started we got a
58:18 lot of photographs from people from my
58:22 my hometown that hadn't changed their
58:25 appearance since the 80s and I mean the
58:28 makeup the high hair the clothing they
58:31 look exactly like a time capsule that is
58:33 simply aged a little bit from the 80s
58:37 and I reflect on that now and I I want
58:41 to qualify my own personal thoughts to
58:43 myself which is to say well as long as
58:46 they have matured over time and there
58:49 are still a great person they hung on to
58:50 their principles it doesn't really
58:52 matter what they look like they can
58:54 continue wear acid-washed jeans and have
58:56 high hair and all that good stuff I
58:59 apologize for the jackhammer that just
59:02 showed up in the middle of the show here
59:04 we have a little one of those situations
59:06 where the street outside my house has a
59:07 little cordoned off coned off area where
59:11 they're doing some work luckily we're
59:13 towards the end of our episode here it's
59:16 like MKULTRA in my mind the beautiful
59:20 thing about a deep thought is that it
59:21 puts you directly in the epicenter of
59:23 your own intelligence
59:24 and you know I just did the episode on
59:27 fake intelligence and so when you listen
59:30 to someone else either disagree with you
59:32 or take you on a journey of thought no
59:35 matter what it is right you're having
59:37 your own sort of deflection and
59:40 reflection on every single thing that
59:42 that I'm saying right you either agree
59:44 with me or don't agree with me but
59:46 regardless you're getting to know
59:47 yourself a lot better in the process
59:49 which is the overall value hopefully of
59:51 this particular show I want you to have
59:54 complete control over your mind I don't
59:57 want there to be a marketing firm out
59:58 there that can tell you that you're
60:00 obsolete now again if you're
60:03 specifically a person that is in a
60:06 career that needs that has a lot of
60:08 upgrading or
60:08 you're a programmer you're an engineer
60:10 you're going to need to stay up on
60:13 trends of technology that's just the way
60:16 it is right so there are exceptions to
60:20 this rule but that's more of a probably
60:23 the positive side of the development of
60:25 mankind
60:26 right but the pattern fatigue that I was
60:29 referencing earlier where something
60:31 looks outdated it's really silly there's
60:35 some of us that like tacos and ax tacos
60:38 simply has a shell some meat some cheese
60:42 some lettuce and maybe some tomato with
60:44 a little bit of salsa on top and for the
60:47 rest of my life I don't need the taco
60:49 reinvented it was made perfectly and I
60:52 don't reinvent my taste buds over time
60:54 so the taco will always taste good to me
60:57 now if I eat 25 in a row I will probably
60:59 not eat them for a month right what does
61:02 taco bell tried to do we've got a taco
61:05 repens beans and some other thing and
61:08 they were they're reinventing the taco
61:10 as if people are actually tired of a
61:13 normal taco the reality is technically
61:17 speaking that Taco Bell is so replaced
61:20 their meat with fillers and binders and
61:22 [ __ ] and shrunk the size of the taco
61:25 and they don't actually have cheese
61:26 that's actual milk that it no longer
61:31 tastes good
61:32 and so you think I've got tacos just
61:33 tastes crappy these days until you go
61:36 off to a Miguel juniors here in Southern
61:38 California like ah ha there's cheese
61:40 there's a real taco not everything has
61:44 to be in reinvented as a good piece of
61:47 artwork on the wall of your house you
61:50 don't get tired of it necessarily right
61:52 as people are people tired of the Mona
61:54 Lisa I'm not going to the Louvre why
61:56 that Mona Lisa it's so old I've seen
61:58 that my whole life I don't want to see
62:00 it again
62:01 hey you may not need to see it in real
62:02 life more than a couple of times before
62:04 you you know elect not to go through the
62:07 pain of getting getting into the Louvre
62:09 and navigating the tourism but that has
62:11 nothing to do with the Mona Lisa herself
62:13 right in closing I just want to say this
62:16 really doesn't have anything to do with
62:18 you trying new things in life
62:20 of being adventurous if anything the
62:24 less you adopt trends your journey and
62:27 your exploration of life will be more
62:28 your invention and not some marketing
62:31 firms invention right where do you go on
62:33 holiday well why don't you decide if you
62:37 have absolutely no idea travel agents
62:39 will definitely suggest a bunch of
62:40 wonderful alternatives but hopefully it
62:42 goes well what do you like in the world
62:45 well I don't know we'll have you ever
62:47 been to the Bahamas well no well what's
62:50 that have to do well okay do you like
62:51 warm sunny clean beaches oh yeah yeah
62:57 you know I never really experienced that
62:58 before but that sounds fantastic and
63:00 they go well that's why you might like
63:02 the Bahamas but it's based on your
63:04 review of the world what you like
63:07 becomes what people will be recommending
63:11 to you and what you go off spend your
63:13 money and time doing it doesn't mean
63:15 you're gonna win every single time but
63:17 at least you're trying based on what you
63:19 like right I think you feel me
63:22 this jackhammer is not gonna stop here
63:24 they'll stop the second I stopped
63:26 recording if you have a minute deep
63:28 thoughts radio calm please go there's
