00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
00:38 deep thoughts so I smoked this very
00:41 bizarre dilemma shun of Chile a lot of
00:48 some smoked lounge looks pretty cool
00:50 today we're going to talk about
00:52 censorship because it's now a big deal
00:55 in August of 2018 sites like Alex Jones
00:59 are being taken off various private
01:02 corporate channels but what's weird
01:04 about as the eight a bunch of articles
01:05 saying that you know a particular
01:08 company is taking him down when they are
01:10 running articles at a different part of
01:12 the internet saying how that company is
01:13 not only not taking him down but
01:15 defending his position to have his own
01:17 voice so sort of all over the map
01:20 unfortunately but what is censorship who
01:24 would do it are you for censorship you
01:29 know and of course everyone has a
01:31 knee-jerk reaction no no no not me my
01:33 god censorship jeez that's it's Tom
01:35 monistic rule kind of stuff right when I
01:39 was a kid censorship was simply a
01:43 barrier to maturity you weren't allowed
01:47 to see certain things on TV because it
01:49 was readily available to all ages and
01:51 all sexes but if you were old enough and
01:54 you were in the right pocket you were
01:58 allowed to see certain things when I say
02:01 sexes I mean for instance war we
02:06 wouldn't let women see certain gruesome
02:09 sections of war sure there's women who
02:13 are medical staff that are not only
02:15 allowed to see it but elected to help
02:19 cure the problem right but overall we
02:23 didn't let children listen to swearing
02:25 we had a rating system in the movie
02:27 theatre which is sort of a joke today
02:29 but that's what it was for just to allow
02:31 people to choose what they wanted to
02:34 become as they got older do you want to
02:36 start swearing like crazy you know is
02:39 porn going to be a big part of your life
02:41 in order to be sexually happy with your
02:43 spouse but today it is a matter of
02:46 propaganda
02:49 curtailing so we know that every single
02:53 news organization in this planet that
02:55 has been attached to any sort of massive
02:57 funding is a completely corrupt arm of
03:00 the deep state deep state being defined
03:02 as the bankers that rule the world down
03:05 to all those who are willing to suck on
03:07 their tit to feel powerful right they go
03:12 and find these these almost pathological
03:16 losers of the world and promise them
03:19 fame and prosperity and you know they're
03:23 sitting there going you know you're
03:24 always been the prosecuted or persecuted
03:26 individual hey you want to change your
03:28 name to Barack Obama and become
03:30 president well you know I was born in
03:32 Kenya I can't do it don't even worry
03:34 about it man don't even worry about it
03:36 we got something called censorship and
03:40 we'll pull that out the last the last
03:43 ditch effort I guess maybe lastest
03:45 effort was will kill Rolling Stone
03:47 reporters who find out the truth will
03:50 disappear Joan Rivers for speaking the
03:53 truth for me I think I like to roll my
03:58 own in this world it pains me to be
04:01 reliant on a platform to have a platform
04:05 but I don't have to be personally doing
04:07 this to feel happy with my contribution
04:10 to society but it is nice to reach out
04:13 to potentially the entire planet because
04:15 I'm on YouTube that's pretty cool I've
04:20 said some pretty controversial things on
04:21 here but I'm not saying it in a way that
04:23 I think is alarming so my stuff just
04:27 stays up there yeah I got probably a
04:30 dozen videos with demonetised out of a
04:32 327 videos you know I watch pre-roll ads
04:36 on on videos on YouTube where guys are
04:40 slinging fake semen and fake feces and
04:44 fake vaginal blood on people inside
04:48 bathrooms and they get full role
04:52 pre-roll ads on their videos from
04:54 YouTube as if anyone wants to pre-roll
04:58 in front of that crap and I simply meet
05:01 me mention the word like enemy 911 and
05:06 all sudden I'm demonetized
05:09 because that is touching on a an agenda
05:12 of the deep state now I think it's
05:16 pretty evident to all of you guys that
05:18 all of the social media of the world
05:20 only became the top social media in the
05:24 world because it's part of the five eyes
05:26 the five eyes are the five intelligence
05:28 agencies around the world who spy on
05:30 each other with full knowledge that
05:33 they're being spied on so that they can
05:35 trade information to get around and
05:36 skirt the law that says that they're not
05:38 able to be spied on themselves for
05:40 instance the Fourth Amendment forbids
05:43 eavesdropping and spying in the United
05:45 States of America so it is illegal for
05:46 any of our organizations to spy on us
05:49 even though they do they could they
05:52 cannot do it legally now what's cool
05:55 about the NSA in my opinion is that they
05:56 spy store and and ignore until there's a
06:00 FISA warrant or some sort of other
06:01 warrant to search the information on you
06:03 but then you still have evidence as
06:07 being made admissible into court that
06:09 was gained through a non constitutional
06:10 or unconstitutional methods of violating
06:13 Fourth Amendment so what they end up
06:14 doing is saying you know Israel Britain
06:17 Australia all of Europe they're all able
06:20 to spy on US American citizens and if we
06:24 need information on John Doe the plumber
06:25 we go to one of the other four eyes to
06:28 get the information on our eye and
06:30 advice first it goes around right well
06:33 Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram any
06:37 of these gigantic corporations that are
06:40 part of a social media fabric they're
06:42 all owned by those people and they
06:43 always have been most of them have
06:45 developed around and using the
06:49 intelligence agencies that we don't like
06:51 the individuals within those agencies
06:53 that we don't like to become powerful
06:55 Apple becoming powerful was all about
06:58 Steve Jobs his last clients at next
07:01 computer which was the clowns he goes
07:05 into 93 he pops out three years later
07:07 and he's taking over Apple and he's
07:09 integrating all of this miniaturization
07:10 and algorithms into his company
07:12 meanwhile Google is often Stanford can
07:15 Epis exploding you know releasing map
07:18 technology in the first day that worked
07:20 the first time like there was no there
07:22 were no problems with that technology
07:23 because it was developed by our tax
07:25 dollars for the military and for the
07:27 intelligence agencies right so you have
07:32 to understand that it's all the computer
07:33 operating systems that you've ever toyed
07:36 with it's all about spying on your data
07:39 and harvesting the data into binary
07:41 trees that are easily searchable you
07:45 know 11 million entries can be searched
07:47 in about 7 milliseconds so how many
07:50 files do you have 100 billion ok we're
07:54 up to maybe one tenth of a second trying
07:59 to search that information but I sure
08:01 about every single flavor of Ubuntu Unix
08:06 it might be the easiest ones to get into
08:08 I don't know but Apple operating system
08:11 the Mac operating system windows and
08:13 chrome are all wide open hardware said
08:17 open read an article today latest
08:19 MacBook was hacked into the second it
08:22 was attached to its first Wi-Fi
08:23 connection pretty amazing pretty amazing
08:27 you know sharing file sharing is not
08:29 turned on automatically on a Macintosh
08:31 you have to turn it on I think the same
08:32 thing with Windows right so you have to
08:35 understand those things in my opinion to
08:36 understand the context of what
08:38 censorship is today censorship today is
08:41 not protecting young people from mature
08:43 information censorship today is to
08:45 control all narratives inside the human
08:48 mind period all languages all cultures
08:53 all orientations genders everything it's
08:58 all supposed to be filtered into one
09:00 Avenue and it was going pretty good
09:03 until Americans voted in 2016 and
09:06 changed everything now there's always
09:09 been a vote here and there around the
09:10 world but when you get the largest
09:12 superpower in the world largest gross
09:15 gross domestic product country in the
09:18 world with the most money in the world
09:21 when you get that country to change its
09:24 ways and stop living in this censorship
09:28 bubble
09:29 with a president that's very cavalier
09:33 yeah we look at it as unrefined sure but
09:36 in the end it's actually a bit of
09:39 freedom to sort of be who you are just
09:41 certain certain to have a certain style
09:43 right how many times is president Trump
09:46 raked over the coals for not being
09:48 presidential hopefully you've had the
09:51 guts to watch one of his rallies that he
09:53 does for budding GOP candidates where he
09:57 addresses the issue he mocks the press
10:00 he mocks society and he says they say
10:03 I'm not presidential enough but let me
10:04 show you what that's like you would be
10:05 bored to death this auditorium wouldn't
10:08 be full if I was being presidential why
10:10 because they all act the same no one's
10:12 saying anything different you could
10:14 predict what I would say before you even
10:16 came to the rally and they stay home and
10:18 you'd be right so why come lied to come
10:20 to a rally you know culture needs
10:23 diversity it needs it within its own
10:27 culture pick a culture let's see the
10:29 American culture forget about everything
10:31 else and thus picking on other folks for
10:34 their differences when I grew up you had
10:38 my god just in music alone you had your
10:42 older folks like my grandparents playing
10:45 big band big band stuff and really cool
10:47 you know Lawrence Welk kind of music and
10:50 then in my dad's realm you had deep
10:52 purple and you know the temptations in
10:55 my world you had Grandmaster Flash you
10:58 had rapper's delight'
10:59 you had you know Queen and Van Halen and
11:03 all these groups all the British rock
11:05 bands you know within a neighborhood you
11:07 had you know I mean again we had black
11:10 guys that walked down the street and
11:12 they had a walk they had a walk that was
11:14 wild and white guys would be all jealous
11:16 cuz we were drowned by coming to him
11:17 that brother has actually paid attention
11:19 to himself he's got his clothes dialed
11:22 in he's got his walk dialed in his hair
11:25 his sunglasses his shoes everything way
11:27 he talks what he likes in terms of music
11:31 the guys would carry these big-ass boom
11:32 boxes right and they'd be playing some
11:35 music you didn't know where the hell he
11:37 got it but it was the best time music
11:38 you ever heard in your life within that
11:40 genre of music
11:43 meanwhile there's another guy driving by
11:45 in his IROC and he's got you know the
11:47 latest van Halen blasting or craft work
11:51 music done stop or something and it was
11:55 a great world where everyone got along
11:57 everyone respected each other and
11:59 because you know you're the white guy
12:01 he's only competed against other white
12:02 guys a black guys only compete against
12:04 other black guys the cool thing was that
12:06 across the river right across those
12:09 those divides there was just pure
12:12 admiration why am i mentioning this
12:15 because when you censor society you
12:17 censor the ability of that to ever occur
12:20 again oh you can't do that why because
12:24 we censor that because that offends some
12:26 [ __ ] snowflake up in Berkeley well
12:28 [ __ ] Berkeley it's a teeny tiny [ __ ]
12:30 place right let the little [ __ ]
12:33 snowflakes go up there and make Berkeley
12:35 something else totally cool that when I
12:36 go there I'm like ah you know it's very
12:38 different than me you guys don't do the
12:39 things that I do but I appreciate
12:42 Berkeley for being completely different
12:43 but don't go around trying to ruin the
12:45 world and when one of your folks invites
12:49 was at Milo to go speak at some
12:53 conservative rally
12:56 don't burn your [ __ ] building down
12:58 you know I mean it would disgust me is
13:01 that we've got censorship to a point
13:03 where it's now controlling other factors
13:06 of society right so part of censorship
13:08 is just to say you can't hear
13:10 information right what is enlightenment
13:12 again enlightenment is seeing something
13:15 new well how the hell can you see
13:17 something new when you're [ __ ]
13:18 censored oh I was gonna look at that but
13:22 somebody said I can't oh okay well I am
13:24 a robot I am a sheep I am a cattle but
13:26 don't call me a sheep and a cattle
13:28 because I will get so offended that you
13:30 call me a sheep and accountable I'm a
13:31 sheep and I'm a cattle I'm a sheep on
13:33 the cattle right that's how it works now
13:37 the other thing I want to caution you
13:38 guys against is that we could be getting
13:40 played we could be getting played at
13:44 every single level who we think is good
13:46 is bad who is bad is good I mean we
13:48 don't know I don't really think there's
13:50 any we think they're bad in their good
13:52 situations but depends on what narrative
13:55 you're endorsing
13:56 if you're trusting Apple and you're
13:58 trusting Microsoft and Twitter and
14:01 Facebook and YouTube to have your best
14:04 interests in mind I would say you're not
14:06 part of their board of directors I don't
14:09 think you are and so they have their own
14:13 little ecosystem of their own concerns
14:14 and they don't necessarily play with
14:16 each other now it looks like when Alex
14:18 Jones got nailed a bunch of them played
14:20 together but I'm gonna read an article
14:23 is that like one this morning about how
14:25 Twitter's defending Alex Jones about how
14:28 Apple's defending Alex Jones but then I
14:30 read an article you know seven hours
14:33 later about how they are still in the
14:35 bandwagon of censoring him as if these
14:39 reporters have no [ __ ] ability to
14:42 read other people's news before they go
14:43 out and read an article it's like it's
14:45 like most of the news in the world is
14:47 just rumor news anyway hasn't been
14:49 research there's no journalistic
14:50 integrity and anything YouTube is a
14:54 place where you get these 19 year old
14:56 kids that have done more journalism in
14:58 the last six months then you know dan
15:01 Rather did his whole [ __ ] life right
15:04 I'm not really angry I'm just
15:06 emphasizing my phrases with expletives
15:10 hmm
15:10 freedom the irony of non censorship in
15:16 this video is just so palpable
15:18 where has censorship been in society as
15:22 far back as perhaps the Greek theater
15:25 you don't get a lot of archaeological
15:28 information from Babylonia and Egypt
15:31 Egypt about censorship they don't have
15:34 passages and say oh man you know this
15:37 guy over here was against the Pharaoh
15:38 and bam his head was cut off maybe maybe
15:42 it happened I don't know it seems like
15:45 the Greeks were even very peaceful kind
15:47 of you know and you know countries
15:49 didn't exist back in the day right so
15:50 you had these nomadic tribes that got
15:54 together and eventually created these
15:56 countries and said let's call this land
15:57 a particular name and so it's going to
16:00 be peaceful for a while right because
16:05 everyone's gonna be sharing each other's
16:06 wisdom across the tribes again you
16:09 haven't tried to live by
16:10 they're gonna learn how to fish and take
16:11 care of Beach like things you have a
16:13 tribe that's inland just a few miles and
16:16 they're gonna be like we learned
16:17 agriculture and we learned irrigation
16:19 and these animals that you don't have at
16:22 the beach is what we kill and to eat and
16:23 so let's get together for a few hundred
16:25 years and let's share that information
16:27 it takes a while to congeal congeal a
16:31 country together to then start having
16:34 some sort of global narratives to then
16:36 enforce through censorship but we know
16:39 what happened to folks in was it
16:42 Ethiopia with Pol Pot we know what
16:46 happened with Russian descent we know
16:51 what British descent was like one of the
16:53 things that you'll find the older that
16:55 you get the more you talk to people who
16:57 have travelled in this world is they'll
16:59 go to countries I had a friend of mine
17:00 move from Orange County to Philippines
17:02 the Philippines and he came back a
17:05 little different he was a little bit
17:07 terrified and I said what's the deal and
17:09 he goes why I like the place a lot
17:10 because but man he goes just a few
17:14 blocks down from where I live people
17:15 disappear in the middle of the night
17:16 because they spoke up against the
17:18 government I never knew that I never
17:21 know the Philippines were disappearing
17:23 their own citizens I used to work in a
17:25 company with at least 20 Filipino
17:26 employees and they were all the sweetest
17:28 human beings I've ever met on my
17:30 fricking life and just to have someone
17:33 else within their culture get to the
17:35 state of evil to grab people and
17:37 disappear them it's almost like when you
17:39 meet 20 people from a particular country
17:41 and they're all just really take the
17:43 shirt off your back they're back for you
17:45 kind of people it's hard to imagine that
17:48 there's someone else on their factions I
17:49 want us in their area of the world that
17:51 will go evil right we have favorable
17:55 trade agreements with countries that
17:56 disappear their citizens we look the
17:59 other way because they will turn their
18:01 citizens into slave labor to manufacture
18:04 a product we look the other way well
18:08 hell if you led censorship fester in one
18:10 part of the world it will get to you it
18:13 will get to you so we got to be careful
18:16 not don't we in this world of the United
18:20 States of America and Europe has gone
18:23 completely
18:24 the deep end again Europe is essentially
18:27 virtuous virtue signaling to the world I
18:30 don't know a lot of you from Europe and
18:31 you do not agree with this at all and
18:33 you're their only hope but it seems like
18:38 at least 51% of Europe is saying we love
18:40 tyranny we believe tyranny needs to
18:42 return we are going to look the other
18:45 way as our European Union overlords pass
18:51 censorship laws that will put people in
18:54 jail for acknowledging what simply is
18:56 occurring in this region of the world
18:59 you want to talk about a sanctuary city
19:02 child raping a murderer even a gay
19:07 murder
19:07 you know they sit outside gay nightclubs
19:11 and just murder the guys that come out
19:13 on video cops are told not to do
19:15 anything to stand down Wow and who's
19:20 holding onto that [ __ ] crazy balls
19:22 agenda over there because it's just the
19:25 way it is Britain is putting people in
19:27 jail for simply acknowledging what's
19:28 going on in Britain where's the Queen
19:31 she's sitting back probably rolling her
19:35 hands going we're gonna bring it back
19:36 guys before I even died a hundred and
19:39 fifty thousand years old I'm gonna be
19:41 reigning over a tyrannical England again
19:43 it will be so great we'll have drones
19:46 the police you know little tiny
19:50 microscopic drones that fire bullets
19:52 into your forehead if you happen to go
19:54 against the state and let me just kind
19:56 of put two wires together you got it
19:59 you've had a wire dangling on the right
20:01 side of your head and a wire ding on the
20:03 left side of your head for as long as
20:05 you've been awake but maybe you haven't
20:07 touched the two together so let me touch
20:08 the two together so you guys can see
20:10 sort of what world we are well that we
20:14 need to stop from happening here we know
20:18 that pedophilia has gone absolutely
20:20 crazy in the world that's one wire over
20:21 here and we know that that has been
20:25 allowed because certain intelligence
20:27 agencies police forces government
20:29 officials have been allowed to be
20:31 unchecked unn censored right and what
20:37 they
20:38 and it was this one that gives power to
20:41 this one and when you touch them
20:43 together if you give ultimate power
20:45 through tyranny to this group of people
20:48 then this wire over here which is
20:50 usually unacceptable on every single
20:52 region of the world raping and killing
20:55 women raping and killing kids of all
20:58 ages boys and girls when you touch them
21:01 together you're going to get a supernova
21:04 of a world that won't be worth living in
21:08 now if you into psychology you will get
21:11 into a lot of folks that have raised
21:13 their children one weird way even in my
21:16 not in my home town but in two towns
21:17 north of my hometown there was a family
21:19 it was notorious both professors husband
21:22 and wife they raised their son who was
21:26 born first
21:28 to be able to do anything he wanted
21:32 drugs sex whenever he wanted to they
21:36 just literally raised him outside of any
21:37 rule structure then they had a daughter
21:40 within a year and they raised her in the
21:43 most conservative possible realm she
21:47 could exist in very loving room for what
21:49 I understand but this girl called her
21:52 father on her wedding night to ask
21:56 permission to have sex with their
21:57 husband as the story goes so you can
22:01 raise the kid into believing anything
22:03 that you want to raise them into and
22:05 they will simply adopt that to go see
22:08 Fahrenheit 451 the movie it's a
22:11 fictional tale about burning books but
22:14 that was a whole society bred on burning
22:17 books they retold history wrong Benjamin
22:20 Franklin was a fire fireman he started
22:24 fires against books you didn't put fires
22:27 out now if you talk to a liberal which I
22:29 have plenty of my family I mean he's one
22:32 honestly and you get the whole spectrum
22:34 of all things they will fight arguments
22:38 of censorship through what I call the
22:41 extremist debate tactic I once had the
22:44 conversation about political correctness
22:46 if you watch my episodes and season one
22:47 about it you'll hear this twice but I
22:50 was talking about
22:51 how it's important not to be politically
22:54 correct with all terms because it is a
22:57 cognitive dissidence machine within the
23:00 mind of men I brought up the word
23:02 [ __ ] [ __ ] as a word meaning
23:05 something is slower when you fix the
23:07 timing belt in a car mechanics will talk
23:09 to each other and say you need to [ __ ]
23:11 that you know so many seconds because
23:14 it's off the Pistons aren't firing at
23:16 the right time and that mechanics don't
23:17 get all butthurt they simply go okay we
23:20 put the little gun a little flash gun on
23:22 the on the belt so I can see the little
23:24 line come across and as soon as they get
23:27 that thing timed boom the engine runs
23:28 smooth as glass and you're off to the
23:31 races they charge money for their
23:33 services and they're gone but if you
23:35 have a child then turner under a
23:37 particular level of mental handicap they
23:41 have the [ __ ] gene where they're a
23:43 little slower right they may be able to
23:47 solve for pie at you know hundred
23:49 decimal places but they're just slower
23:52 at doing it perhaps they can draw new
23:55 york city after seeing it one time but
23:57 it takes them four months to do it but
23:59 it's absolutely accurate and perfect and
24:03 so i said we we can't deprecated out of
24:06 society words that mean exactly what
24:09 they mean and that they're very helpful
24:11 to society and communicating about
24:13 something not sure there's a lot of us
24:16 that will use the word [ __ ] again
24:18 something like ow that was so [ __ ]
24:20 it was like a dumb it was like a really
24:22 dumb movie or a dumb play or you know a
24:26 lot of us alpha male guys will say oh my
24:29 god that's so gay oh my god and we don't
24:33 we're not having any thoughts about some
24:35 someone who is gay from the LGBT
24:37 organization we don't have any thoughts
24:39 in that room hey if you had a word that
24:42 was being used against you personally
24:43 and there's a whole group of society
24:45 probably the majority of society are
24:47 taking that word away from you and
24:48 putting it towards inanimate objects
24:51 wouldn't you say that's a winning
24:52 situation right but so the the rebuttal
24:56 in the argument was well we just can't
24:58 call everybody the n-word you know all
25:00 black people the n-word and dadada and
25:01 going through all these different things
25:02 called gay people you know
25:04 and I'm sitting there going yeah that's
25:07 what I'm saying that's exactly what I'm
25:09 saying we need to bring back racially
25:11 motivated slurs we need to bring back
25:13 the persecution of the mentally
25:16 handicapped with jerks and their faces
25:18 going you're so [ __ ] bah bah Papa
25:20 that's what I'm saying you're up well
25:22 you got me locked down you [ __ ]
25:23 intellectual you
25:25 it's an extremist argument to win a
25:27 debate it is what petty people do is
25:31 what super shallow people do that's not
25:35 what we do on the show that's not what
25:36 we do in the YouTube comments we are
25:39 smart we are simply trying to say that
25:42 the brain should never see something for
25:45 what it is use an accurate word to
25:47 designate what we're looking at again
25:49 we're not talking about slang
25:51 about real things and then be told that
25:55 that's not what it is you know it's it's
25:58 strange
25:58 we have cigarettes in the UK called [ __ ]
26:01 I don't know where and the hell that
26:04 word came from it doesn't derive from
26:05 cigarettes cigar I don't know where that
26:08 comes from it seems to have existed
26:10 decades before that word was ever used
26:13 against the homosexual person usually a
26:15 male which is also bizarre why is that
26:17 word only usually used against male
26:19 homosexuals very strange to use that
26:24 word against a male homosexual we're
26:25 talking about something hurtful
26:27 something that's sort of an attack it's
26:30 a slur that's not what anyone who's
26:32 trying to defend the definitions of
26:34 words is trying to do so if you know
26:37 handicapped people people have lost the
26:39 ability to either walk correctly or walk
26:41 at all from the waist down
26:43 well when I was a kid they were
26:46 respectfully called cripples me just
26:49 saying that right now I feel weird
26:51 saying that because I don't ever use
26:52 that word it has been demonized since I
26:56 was a kid well the other thing that I
26:58 know is the people that I have friends
27:00 of that who have had these difficulties
27:02 who have said you know I'm not gonna let
27:05 that get in the way I'm gonna figure out
27:07 a way to play baseball basketball hockey
27:09 I'm in a snowboard I'm gonna water-ski
27:12 you know it's it's in the it's in the
27:15 dozens of people both that I know
27:18 and that I know of on the internet
27:21 there's there's like four or five folks
27:23 in the United States of America that
27:25 were born without arms or legs I just
27:28 was at the airport the other day and I
27:29 saw one of their books I didn't even
27:32 recognize the guy knife Carver the book
27:33 I was like wow another one I'd never
27:34 seen but they go around schools teaching
27:36 kids man you got no excuse so they took
27:39 what is visibly to us a disability
27:42 because we're used to legs and arms and
27:44 they said you know I've never had them
27:45 so I don't know if I miss them at all
27:47 I'm just born different but you know
27:49 what I live a full life I do everything
27:51 that you do they father children or
27:54 mother children right they fall in love
27:58 they have rich wonderful lives they
28:00 don't die early or anything like that
28:01 right but there's two layers of
28:05 censorship isn't there outside of the
28:07 old one when I was a kid which is a
28:08 third one which is you know hey a
28:10 five-year-old shouldn't be watching a
28:12 porn they just shouldn't right because
28:15 the the narrative within porn is a
28:17 corrupt narrative of what people really
28:19 are in the world it just is I would say
28:23 overall narrative right but you have the
28:27 the petty censorship but it's called
28:31 political correctness do the bankers of
28:34 the world really care whether or not you
28:36 call someone is mentally handicapped
28:40 [ __ ] absolutely not do they worry
28:44 about someone in a wheelchair being
28:45 called a [ __ ] absolutely not they do
28:48 not care about all that petty crap but
28:50 but they do put money behind it and they
28:52 do fuel it and why is that because
28:54 they're trying to mold the minds of man
28:56 to be completely conflicted to the very
29:00 core of your thought process they want
29:03 us to be able to be told that they have
29:05 clothes on as the emperors of this
29:08 planet in their own mind and we're gonna
29:11 go oh yeah that looks great you know you
29:14 look wonderful talking about clothes
29:16 that they don't have on as they walk
29:17 down the the main street the main
29:19 thoroughfare completely buck-naked
29:21 but like Charlie Chaplin said in his
29:24 Great Dictator speech he says as long as
29:27 men die Liberty will prevail
29:32 because what is the story of the Emperor
29:35 that has no clothes on he's walking down
29:38 the street
29:39 he's buck naked but they're pretending
29:42 he has on clothing and a big long tail
29:45 right if someone's holding this fake
29:48 tail off the back of his clothing if I
29:50 was his cape or whatever it is and
29:53 everyone's yelling and screaming be
29:56 worried to see where this actual tail
29:57 came from and see if it ever really
29:59 happened but a little boy is standing
30:03 there with his parents he goes oh my God
30:04 look he's naked he's not wearing any
30:06 clothes and that's what Charlie Chaplin
30:09 is talking about because a child will be
30:11 born with its cognitive abilities no
30:14 matter how much you mangle the mind of a
30:16 child with you know prenatal
30:18 vaccinations or whatever the child will
30:22 always see things perfectly at first
30:24 until they are assassinated with
30:26 chemicals until they are told by Al Gore
30:30 about things to fear when they go to bed
30:32 but the other half of censorship that is
30:36 absolutely what the elites of the world
30:38 want against us is any narrative about
30:43 what they are actually doing to us any
30:46 narrative that says that socialism is
30:48 bad that the EU is bad that the Muslim
30:52 invasion of Europe is bad anything that
30:55 you disagree with it's a part of their
30:56 agenda they want laws passed and they're
31:00 getting them in Europe they're getting
31:01 them by the dozens I mean every single
31:03 year there is at least half a dozen
31:06 unthinkable tyrannical laws that are
31:08 passed in Europe but ever since world
31:11 war ii there's fourteen countries i
31:14 believe still that refused to allow
31:16 anyone to debate the facts of the
31:17 Holocaust
31:18 you couldn't possibly adjust anything
31:20 that happened in that story and that
31:22 narrative do we need laws to protect the
31:25 truth do we doesn't a citizen of a
31:29 particular country have the right to say
31:30 hey it's been this way for several
31:31 hundred years if not several thousand
31:33 years and I'm opposed to this particular
31:35 change and then BOOM they're in prison
31:40 they haven't affected the law yet but
31:43 they don't want that I
31:45 dia to rise up and bite them in the butt
31:48 and so they put the person in jail
31:52 I hear censorship arguments all the time
31:54 of you know when you're not allowed to
31:58 see something that you want to see when
32:00 you're not allowed to say something in
32:02 public that you would otherwise be
32:03 allowed to say in America we have a
32:05 tremendous amount of double standards in
32:08 this country for censorship it is
32:11 illegal for a young person to go into an
32:14 r-rated movie by themselves it is
32:16 illegal for them to go into a xxx
32:19 pornstar porn shop to buy a porn
32:22 magazine or a porn blah blah blah it's
32:24 illegal for them to be under 18 and sign
32:26 up to some website online but you can go
32:29 to a gay pride parade here in America
32:31 where a bunch of people show up naked
32:33 they show up with extremely sexually
32:36 explicit objects all over their bodies
32:39 and little children are there watching
32:42 this occur when any other time of day
32:45 without that parade to protect lunacy
32:49 you be put in jail if you pee behind a
32:52 bar against a wall between two dumpsters
32:54 where no one can see your junk you can
32:56 get arrested for public indecency public
32:59 urination and you could be put on the
33:01 sexual predator list here in America
33:04 such that wherever you live you got to
33:06 notify everyone that you're a perv
33:09 because you peed outside you were drunk
33:12 to begin with but now here's the thing
33:14 about censorship we don't even talk
33:16 about it in this world do we I mean we
33:19 only talk about it when something gets
33:20 heightened to awareness and then we talk
33:23 about it but we don't really have
33:24 anything new to say right we simply say
33:27 the old catchphrase says your ship is
33:29 bad okay right that's what we say and
33:31 then we walk off because we're not
33:32 really having the narrative within our
33:34 own little private world to say okay we
33:36 do have to think make up some some
33:39 decisions we have to make some decisions
33:40 about what's going to be allowed and
33:42 what's not going to be allowed we have
33:43 to do this it's important so let's talk
33:47 about it okay part of the sister ship is
33:50 related to disliking something in the
33:54 world on one side of the fence we have
33:57 some people like
33:59 the bakers of the world not wanting to
34:01 make cakes that are going to be for gay
34:04 weddings because their religion says
34:06 marriage is between a man and a woman
34:08 it's the religion they really do
34:11 honestly believe that and they believe
34:13 that if you're homosexual you will go to
34:15 hell now as that might sound
34:18 utterly crazy to some of you they
34:21 actually fear the wrath of their creator
34:24 in the afterlife they fear going to hell
34:27 themselves for eternity if they happen
34:30 to aid this process and any way shape or
34:33 form through laws meaning gay marriage
34:36 is okay to bacon a cake okay well
34:39 they're different than a lot of us okay
34:42 oh my god you know gives a [ __ ]
34:44 personally but that's their thing but we
34:47 have governments in the United States of
34:49 America state and local trying to force
34:52 the issue nope you got to make that cake
34:54 it's discrimination if you don't make
34:55 that cake for a gay couple well probably
35:00 90% of the gay folks I've talked to
35:02 about that issue over the last 10 years
35:03 say that's so much [ __ ] the guy
35:06 doesn't make the cake you go to somebody
35:08 else you don't force someone to do it
35:10 and hey if it becomes really popular to
35:13 be gay then that guy's not gonna be any
35:14 business you know go out of business
35:15 right there you go
35:18 it's self-correcting the society need to
35:20 step in with laws and and jail sentences
35:23 no you just let it take its Organic
35:26 course right when it comes to hate
35:28 crimes well obviously a hate crime is a
35:32 very acidic thing who is going to ever
35:38 endorse ever the lynching of someone
35:42 because of their race the lynching of
35:45 someone because of their sexual
35:46 orientation and we're talking about
35:48 grabbing someone beating someone and in
35:51 a lot of cases unfortunately taking
35:54 their life well the EU is now forbidden
35:57 you from from talking about these things
35:59 when they happen the weird thing is is I
36:02 think the you I haven't been able to
36:04 check this but it seems as though it's
36:08 illegal for a German citizen white Anglo
36:12 Saxon person to perform a rape on a
36:15 child to perform a rape on an adult to
36:20 conduct in a hate crime killing someone
36:22 for their sexual orientation or race
36:25 you'll go to jail but for Muslim does it
36:28 as part of this invasion the cops are
36:31 not allowed to mention it
36:33 the press is not allowed to mention it I
36:35 could be wrong but that's what I'm
36:37 seeing over here that seems to be the
36:39 common thread of all the cases where
36:41 people actually and incur penalties in
36:44 jail time in America thank God if anyone
36:48 does it to anyone you're in trouble
36:50 period in fact the more illegal you are
36:53 in this country the more you're in
36:55 trouble but then we have this whole
36:57 other level which is conspiracy there is
37:00 no doubt there are thousands and
37:03 thousands of conspiracies that are
37:05 currently either active or recently
37:08 active in the political system of the
37:11 United States of America from the state
37:13 level state and local level all the way
37:15 up to the highest levels of the FISA
37:16 Court right if I was a FISA judge right
37:19 now that have been lied to about a
37:21 dossier to spy on a political they're
37:24 just final political candidate who was
37:26 going to oppose the DNC candidate I
37:29 would be so [ __ ] furious I would
37:33 throw the book and more books and anyone
37:36 who lied to me about that because it is
37:38 embarrassing the very paradigm of your
37:40 existence it is making you trivial
37:44 imagine you're a FISA Court judge the
37:47 secret secret court that was invented I
37:49 believe in 2001-2002 somewhere after
37:52 9/11 that was supposed to to validate
37:56 the spying on and surveillance on
37:58 foreign terrorists that's what the
38:00 organization was set up to do and
38:01 somehow they finagle this thing against
38:03 Donald Trump
38:03 you have to like Donald to get behind
38:06 this situation and every day you wake up
38:09 and you think and I'm doing good I'm
38:10 doing good I am protecting the United
38:12 States of America against foreign
38:15 terrorists and then you find out it was
38:17 you were played and you find out that
38:21 your entire life let's say you're in
38:22 your 50s or higher
38:24 you're in age and you got played by some
38:27 criminals and the FBI the CIA the DOJ
38:31 and the DNC you got played by these
38:33 folks and now you're gonna get dragged
38:35 into it on one side you have all those
38:38 individuals that played you threatening
38:40 your life threatening the safety of your
38:42 children to say you better continue
38:45 going along with this otherwise we're
38:47 going to murder you
38:48 we're going to take away everything you
38:51 have you think the story of job's bad
38:52 it's not going to have a third act
38:53 you're gonna stay down and you're gonna
38:55 regret ever going against us we got all
38:57 the money and power in the world look at
38:59 George Soros bank account that is gonna
39:00 finance your demise people like him but
39:05 then the person's got to go jeez I if I
39:08 lose if these corrupt factions lose
39:11 which it looks like they're losing then
39:14 I'm going to go down as the biggest
39:16 conspirator that's ever lived I was the
39:20 one that allowed the tippy-top of
39:24 corruption of the the most corrupt thing
39:26 that's ever happened in United States of
39:27 America in the last hundred years to
39:30 have occurred and I'll record it in the
39:33 history books as one of the Auschwitz
39:35 you know Nazi guys that killed a bunch
39:38 of Jews that's how I'm gonna be
39:39 remembered mmm decisions decisions I
39:43 think I said this in one of my season
39:45 three finale episodes but it's important
39:48 to mention again here I have an attorney
39:50 friend of mine who's a big attorney okay
39:54 he has defended the biggest cases on
39:57 this planet and he told me something
40:00 very special about the way that America
40:03 is set up if you were questioned by any
40:09 of the alphabet agencies in a room and
40:13 you thinkin man I didn't do this crime
40:16 they want to talk to me that's okay I
40:20 got nothing to hide
40:21 I'm just gonna tell the truth but they
40:24 need a patsy they need someone to help
40:25 their case along because they don't
40:27 really have a case and they ask you a
40:29 simple question what did you eat for
40:31 lunch two days ago and you accidentally
40:34 get three days ago mixed up with two
40:36 days ago
40:37 and you said you ate hotdogs when you
40:39 actually ate hamburgers and they know
40:41 they've got photographs of you eating
40:43 hotdogs two days ago you are now in
40:47 contempt of court
40:48 you're now lying to those alphabet
40:50 agencies and now they can press charges
40:52 against you and you've also lied to the
40:54 highest agencies in America such that
40:57 they can press massive charges on you
40:59 because you are lying to a very
41:00 important government agency so the moral
41:06 the story is to never ever ever talk to
41:08 these individuals ever unless you have
41:12 the questions in advance you can do your
41:13 own research to make sure your answers
41:15 are 1,000% perfect there's no room for
41:19 interpretation of any kind it cetera but
41:24 now here's what's legal
41:25 so it's illegal for you to get one atom
41:28 out of place but what's legal is that
41:30 these alphabet agencies are allowed by
41:32 current laws in United States of America
41:34 to lie to you about information around
41:38 you they can tell you that your mother
41:39 turns you in and use illegal
41:42 surveillance against you to concoct a
41:44 story that will make it believable that
41:45 your mother did like I get lie against
41:48 you thus provoking answers in you that
41:50 will get you in trouble so they're
41:52 allowed to lie to you a thousand percent
41:55 and you're not allowed to get one atom
41:57 out of place the Heisenberg uncertainty
42:00 principle does not apply to you but to
42:03 loop back into the solutions realm I
42:04 would say I think it's fairly obvious
42:07 that we have things we want to shelter
42:10 children from but they shouldn't see
42:14 anything that will sway their opinion
42:17 out of organic life right they were
42:19 going to live their life and make their
42:20 own decisions about what they like and
42:22 what they dislike and you're injecting a
42:24 narrative into their school systems
42:26 you're injecting narratives into their
42:27 cartoons into their movies to
42:30 desensitize them against things there's
42:33 a bunch of comedians around the world
42:34 and I have managed some from time to
42:38 time and help them from time to time
42:40 none of my guys ever ever went this dark
42:43 route but they were trying to find an
42:44 edgy thing to make jokes about there's a
42:48 couple guys that are extremely famous
42:49 even a couple girls
42:51 Sarah or Sarah Silverman to be one of
42:54 them and the idea was to push the
42:56 envelope and push the envelope of what
42:57 was acceptable to say on stage louis c.k
43:00 did it - they took pedophilia and they
43:05 made a bunch of jokes about it like one
43:07 guy was unbelievably I forgot his name
43:09 but he's got a special on Netflix and
43:10 his whole thing was about and he goes to
43:13 San Francisco of course where
43:14 everything's really loose you know in
43:16 terms of any moral regard for society
43:18 and he just makes one pedophile joke
43:21 after another onstage raping kids having
43:24 sex with kids tricking kids into sex and
43:26 he gets celebrated oh sure the audience
43:29 is kind of ooh ooh that's oh and then
43:32 they're laughing and they're giving this
43:34 guy money giving him an entire career do
43:37 nothing more than degradation the very
43:39 fabric of society the protectionism that
43:41 we have around children who are innocent
43:43 and absolutely vulnerable to adults
43:45 right think about it when your child
43:47 comes out of the mother it is under
43:50 legal guard by the parent until they're
43:53 18 you know maybe you're Gary Coleman
43:55 you can get out early if your parents
43:57 are stealing all your money but still up
43:59 to 14 years old 14 years of development
44:01 the parent has got to protect the child
44:04 from society well are the parents
44:08 censoring all the cartoons yeah most
44:13 cartoons are good they really are but
44:17 then there's this weird blurry line at
44:18 18 years old what can you do at 18 hmm
44:21 well you can vote you can die for your
44:24 country in war but you can't smoke
44:27 tobacco and you can't drink alcohol but
44:31 supposedly at 21 there's this amazing
44:33 epiphany between 30 18 and 21 supposedly
44:37 gained all the faculties to understand
44:38 alcohol and cigarettes all right and we
44:41 all know that kids have no problem
44:44 getting this stuff just as soon as they
44:46 want it in this world at my hometown
44:49 there was at least two cops that were
44:51 buying all the alcohol for the kids all
44:55 right I know some of those kids who are
44:57 alcoholics today but they had their
45:00 booze purchased by the police
45:04 those folks are long gone they're
45:06 retired we know families that have
45:08 alcoholism that run in their family the
45:10 kids have a predisposition to be able to
45:12 tolerate tremendous amounts of alcohol
45:13 without any super ill effects they never
45:15 throw up they never have the self
45:18 correcting problem that my family has
45:20 that when you drink too much you'll stop
45:22 you'll stop I was trying to think last
45:24 time I was drunk and I can't remember I
45:27 can't remember last time I start I was
45:29 probably in my 20s that's over 20 years
45:32 ago folks thought I had a 48 year old
45:35 girl I was dating once asked me when I
45:37 was 46 she said well it's really weird I
45:39 can't you never get drunk what's wrong
45:41 with you I said I'm over 40 that's why I
45:45 don't get drunk and that look on her
45:47 face was like I don't understand what
45:49 you're saying Society has taught me how
45:50 to behave and I must be drunk
45:52 you must be drunk too and everyone must
45:54 get drunk that's just how we all shake
45:55 off life this person was hardly living
45:59 in some tyrannical world so as much as
46:01 censorship it controls what you can
46:05 think and forbids you from thinking
46:06 things it also is a mechanism by which
46:08 it opens up things that you would never
46:10 be exposed to I mean let's let's do a
46:13 little bit of math here we're not
46:16 allowed to use words like [ __ ]
46:18 anymore and again used as a slang and a
46:23 slang against someone especially was
46:25 mentally handicapped is the most
46:27 reprehensible thing human being could do
46:28 to another human being quite frankly but
46:30 when they want to erect gigantic statues
46:33 to Satan which has a mantra of human
46:38 sacrifice of the undoing of life that's
46:42 totally cool when art gallery gets set
46:44 up in San Francisco or LA or New York
46:47 that is full of photographs of things
46:50 that were would be utterly utterly
46:53 illegal to see as a young person
46:55 there's no age check at the door you can
46:59 bring your 12 year old kid in there to
47:00 see this stuff I watched a Murakami
47:03 installation in MOCA and one of the
47:07 statues is a naked boy kind of a I don't
47:10 know maybe late teens early 20s kid it's
47:12 an animate cartoon character he's
47:15 holding his junk and he's ejaculated
47:18 and there is a cloud of his ejaculate
47:22 swimming around his body it's an amazing
47:26 sculpture it's an anime sex thing I sat
47:32 there with parents with little kids
47:33 looking at this thing and I'm sitting
47:37 there thinking well on one level they
47:38 had no idea the statue was in there but
47:40 the second that they turned the corner
47:41 and go holy [ __ ] you kids can't go in
47:44 that room and again there was no
47:46 censorship about that but if you were to
47:51 enact that exact scene to the best of
47:53 your ability with a real human being put
47:55 it into a video and showed it to a bunch
47:58 of kids at a grade school that person
48:00 would be behind bars for the rest of
48:02 their [ __ ] life probably killed in
48:03 prison for being a pedo and exposing
48:06 children to that stuff but in the form
48:08 of quote-unquote art everything becomes
48:11 legal just like the gay pride parades
48:14 which have all kinds of guy walking on a
48:16 dildo suit with his ax with his real
48:18 junk hanging out down the center but
48:21 again my buddies who take a piss behind
48:23 two dumpsters oh well they're gonna get
48:25 put on some list so we have a big
48:27 dilemma on our hands what is censored if
48:30 you can die for your country can't you
48:31 smoke a cigarette can't you have a beer
48:34 maybe not the same exact time if you can
48:37 vote for the leaders of this world don't
48:41 you think you could sip a beer smoke a
48:45 cigarette in the United States of
48:47 America we have this white privileged
48:51 group called an Tifa pure fascist group
48:56 they are allowed to attack citizens for
48:59 their opinions but the police have
49:02 barely stepped up to the plate I taken
49:05 and Tifa down at any one of these
49:07 organizations why because the governor
49:09 or the mayor or the chief of police tell
49:12 him to stand down hmm there's no sound
49:16 [ __ ] to you my entire life being an
49:19 American freedom of speech the First
49:22 Amendment of the Constitution slash the
49:24 Bill of Rights has been one of the most
49:25 prestigious things that we hold up as
49:28 what makes us different the idea that
49:30 can't be killed
49:32 the Second Amendment the right to bear
49:34 arms was invented to protect the First
49:36 Amendment which is why it's number two
49:38 on the list right if it was for hunting
49:42 it'd be like ten I mean you can hunt
49:45 with a gun these things are very very
49:48 important but we are being attacked from
49:51 every conceivable angle in terms of a
49:54 double standard in terms of a cognitive
49:58 dissidence mechanism such that you
50:00 experience one thing and it's illegal
50:02 but when done the exact same thing is
50:04 done even at higher extremes in a
50:07 different context - the same exact
50:09 people it's okay it's a super tough nut
50:12 to crack it's a super tough nut to even
50:16 get into a conversation about it with
50:17 the most intellectual people who agree
50:19 with you you know let's just go down an
50:21 exercise what if we said using the word
50:23 [ __ ] as a slur is illegal the net word is
50:29 almost completely deprecated out of
50:31 society and becomes an illegal word that
50:34 then can bring charges against you
50:36 unless perhaps you're from Britain and
50:37 you're talking about it against a
50:39 cigarette okay maybe we split the hair
50:42 and we go okay if it's used as a
50:43 derogatory slang towards a human for
50:47 their sexual orientation then it's a
50:49 crime it's a hate crime using it using
50:52 it against an inanimate object a movie a
50:54 car something else well that's okay you
50:58 see how that could get really really
51:00 tough
51:01 oh you sit how did you use that word
51:02 again because I'm going to call the
51:03 police if you used it in this way I
51:04 can't call the police if you call it in
51:06 that way I think a lot of what's going
51:08 on is they're trying to control who you
51:11 can like what you can like who you can
51:13 hate and what you can hate hopefully you
51:15 hate nothing in this world besides
51:16 tyranny and you know people that try to
51:20 control the planet people try to corrupt
51:22 society money is the number-one fuel to
51:29 allow those that want to change the
51:31 world to be able to change the world
51:34 think about a law how's the law passed
51:37 someone drafts it and that a bunch of
51:39 people vote on it well what has to
51:41 happen before it gets drafted there has
51:43 to be this sentiment in society that it
51:45 is something in the consciousness of man
51:47 that needs to be litigated against then
51:50 there's a vote well it used to be that
51:52 our representatives represented the
51:55 constituents now lobbyists get in there
51:57 and pay them off and all the votes are
51:58 coming out of who's got enough money to
52:00 pay off all the politicians well there's
52:03 plenty of people there's infinite money
52:06 out there to pay these folks often
52:07 because they're all chilly deep Staters
52:10 that's what they got into office to do
52:15 that's how they got into office in the
52:16 first place so the only thing you need
52:18 to do is drum up the sentiment to get
52:21 the law drafted but we know laws are
52:23 drafted without any sentiment things
52:25 that we don't care about you know
52:27 there's no people in California okay
52:30 that are against straws plastic straws
52:33 you know there's a few liberals in San
52:35 Francisco probably but there's not
52:37 enough people in the state of California
52:39 to really pass a law against straws but
52:42 there's some cabal against straws go to
52:45 an airport go to an airport right at the
52:47 TSA check-in and look at how many metric
52:49 tons of water and plastic items that are
52:52 being thrown into bins at the last
52:55 second water that's being completely
52:56 wasted all your soda drinks everything
52:59 as if somehow you could drink
53:01 nitroglycerin one of the two compounds
53:03 that make up nitroglycerin and survive
53:06 right so you should be like a water
53:08 bottle and go doink
53:09 see I'm okay here smell this right here
53:12 why don't you dub your little swab thing
53:14 into my water I'll pull a little bit on
53:16 the thing and then you can run it
53:17 against a bomb checking thing and you
53:19 can tell if it's water or not insanity
53:21 absolutely sandy the level of waste
53:24 that's going on in America simply due to
53:25 the TSA it's not the employees fault
53:28 it's whoever passed these laws and let's
53:31 review for one second here because you
53:33 guys need to repeat this over and over
53:35 and over to your friends and family
53:36 don't necessarily have to break it
53:39 across the consciousness of TSA
53:40 employees who are just doing their job
53:42 right they weren't you know they weren't
53:45 incubated in some camps to go against
53:47 America and then hatched into this
53:49 position they're just kids trying to try
53:50 to do what they do right but the whole
53:53 liquid on board thing was hatched out of
53:57 a [ __ ] thing that happened in
53:59 UK there was some plane I was up late at
54:02 night when this happened I watched it
54:03 all it went from like three to seven to
54:07 potentially 27 people or whatever were
54:10 were conspiring to blow up a plane using
54:12 liquid explosives and they were all
54:13 detained out of the jet broad daylight
54:15 and was headed towards New York City
54:17 eventually the investigation went on a
54:19 few days and all the men were let off
54:21 because none of them had liquid
54:23 explosives at all it was a complete
54:27 false accusation against these
54:29 individuals it never happened but all
54:31 the sudden TSA lumped into there their
54:34 protocol you couldn't bring liquids on
54:36 board any of you know anything about
54:39 nitroglycerin the two active ingredients
54:41 could be held in the two bottles that
54:42 they allow you to bring in mixed in a
54:44 bathroom it divides in the bathrooms
54:47 shake it up in your [ __ ] seat and the
54:48 fuselage blows to hell right or at least
54:51 the shock wave inside the fuselage would
54:54 kill pretty much everyone in the whole
54:55 thing they're not protecting you against
54:58 anything they're just trying to instill
55:00 turn the tyranny on you one little step
55:03 at a time the shoe bomber guy right this
55:07 pathetic [ __ ] loser who was escorted
55:10 onto a plane by an FBI agent who then
55:12 sits a couple seats behind him he pulls
55:15 the strings on his shoes and obviously
55:16 there was no intent to kill anyone
55:18 because the FBI guys on the plane with
55:20 him there was basically tent amount two
55:22 bad firecrackers in his shoe right the
55:25 guy is a complete [ __ ] loser of this
55:28 world trying to become profound trying
55:30 to get himself a legacy well he got
55:32 himself one and now we have to take our
55:34 shoes off because of this false flag
55:37 that was occurring on a plane how easy
55:40 it is to manipulate society right
55:43 one of the chief fueling forces of
55:46 censorship in this world are individuals
55:49 with no purpose in their lives students
55:52 that have big degrees nothing that have
55:56 huge debts they have no future and
55:58 someone walks by on a Craigslist post
56:01 from the Soros group and pays them to
56:05 hook up at a rally and they find more
56:07 lost souls and they're like oh you're
56:09 lost in disgruntle too well then let's
56:11 get this get-together
56:12 and then they are willing to buy all
56:15 these false narratives because they have
56:17 barely two [ __ ] brain cells to rub
56:19 together which is why they're in the
56:21 debacle they're in there bad degree
56:24 choices and they're bad majors simply so
56:26 get the degree it was a sign of their
56:29 inability to process data properly and
56:33 so we have these small factions when I
56:35 was a kid it was the PTA which was the I
56:39 forgot the hell it stands for it's like
56:40 Teachers Association or something like
56:43 that but they would wreak havoc on
56:46 little communities like where I was from
56:48 coming in with all their rules and their
56:50 sensitivity training and all this other
56:51 stuff hey did we all need a little
56:54 sensitivity training sure but it's
56:55 called society you get rejected because
56:58 you're an [ __ ] you'll either remain
57:00 an [ __ ] and remain completely
57:01 isolated by yourself or you'll change
57:03 because that's what people do right hate
57:08 is a very inexpensive emotion however it
57:11 takes a lot to hang on to the
57:12 disgruntled heart over time so
57:15 eventually you calm down
57:16 your genetics calmed down why is your
57:19 genetics calm down in an aggressive
57:20 manner to a peaceful manner very simple
57:23 when you were young in a tribe a
57:25 thousand years ago or 2,000 or 50,000
57:28 years ago you were expected to be the
57:29 hunters go out there and get some food
57:31 for us for us old people sitting in our
57:34 beds like you know charlie buckets
57:35 grandparents right and once you got
57:37 older the aggressive gene inside the
57:39 human body calmed down because you
57:41 weren't expected to go out and hunt it
57:43 was it's a natural biological cycle of
57:45 the human body
57:46 so why people calm down who are militant
57:49 crazy gangbangers they always do look at
57:52 all those prison shows they always calm
57:54 down I know plenty of people in the
57:56 world who were very evil and they were
57:57 young and they calmed down it's a
58:00 natural cycle so the the rulers of the
58:03 world know this is the cycle and so they
58:05 take advantage of folks if you're in the
58:07 military and you got deep into the
58:10 military and you didn't go full career
58:11 into like Special Ops where you're
58:13 remaining a very violent individual they
58:16 know that there's a Delta Force cutoff
58:18 where you simply become useless because
58:20 you're gaining too many moral fibers and
58:22 you can't do what you used to do you're
58:25 thinking it through
58:25 probably
58:26 make some pains as well but the military
58:29 code the Pentagon is that soldiers have
58:31 to be built out of kids from the age of
58:32 18 to 23 because at 23 they gain a moral
58:36 fiber they become useless to the
58:40 senseless wars that are out there to
58:42 keep the world thinking that they hate
58:43 each other so the bankers stay in charge
58:45 the officials stay in charge sistership
58:48 is two stages control the narrative
58:50 inside the minds of human beings and
58:52 thus the second stage control how
58:54 society forms around those individuals
58:56 such that it could be easily controlled
58:58 do we need society to be easily
59:00 controlled well we don't want it to be
59:03 chaotic we don't want to be law of the
59:05 jungle so we need a little bit of order
59:07 in this world within the confines of the
59:10 United States of America all individuals
59:12 / corporations which are just simply
59:14 paper organizations paper individuals I
59:16 should say with their own AI in numbers
59:18 instead of Social Security numbers must
59:19 abide by the laws of this country as
59:23 long as the First Amendment exists in
59:24 the United States of America all
59:26 corporations have to honor it when you
59:28 buy property anywhere in the United
59:29 States of America there's a little seal
59:31 that has to be on the bottom of your
59:32 broker it says that you cannot be turned
59:35 down because of your race well that
59:38 sounds like a pretty good idea don't you
59:39 think why would that not apply to
59:43 everything you have vo right do you have
59:47 the right to assault someone basically
59:48 verbally threat someone's existence no
59:51 do you have the right to hurt them
59:53 battery no we have laws they're already
59:57 in existence we've done a pretty good
59:58 job with our country so far Europe used
60:00 to have a pretty good grasp with this as
60:02 well but there's a gigantic cabal going
60:04 on over there and I'm not sure exactly
60:06 who's buying everything it doesn't make
60:08 a lot of sense to me
60:09 but it's time to make decisions heroes
60:13 are defined by their decisions under
60:15 pressure well every single person who
60:17 can hear my voice is a hero you are well
60:20 now you have to make a tough decision
60:21 under pressure are you going to live
60:23 your life what are you allow to infect
60:25 the minds of your children your own
60:28 brain what are you going to speak in
60:30 public what are your opinions but they
60:34 will found opinions are they need jerky
60:36 narrative opinions that have been
60:38 inserted for you
60:40 when you try to censor someone else why
60:43 are you doing that we try to censor
60:45 yourself why are you doing that I don't
60:47 have all the answers
60:49 in fact I barely have any but it's a
60:52 discussion that needs to start happening
60:55 all around the world again we have
60:59 countries that don't allow free speech
61:01 and they're allowed to be partners with
61:04 the rest of the countries that least at
61:05 one point had free speech America still
61:08 has it largely and we are looking the
61:12 other way
61:13 so that we can get iPhones for cheap TVs
61:16 for cheap hmm sounds like there might be
61:20 some precedents to shut some of those
61:21 arteries off bring all those jobs back
61:24 home pay a little bit more but know that
61:26 it wasn't bound it wasn't created I
61:28 should say into existence through
61:31 tyranny and slave labor censorship feeds
61:36 tyranny and censorship feeds socialism
61:39 and if those are so good
61:42 if tyranny and socialism are so
61:44 fantastic but I dare say this should
61:47 happen naturally in society and not
61:48 through enforcement I hope you fill me
61:52 if um into deep thoughts radio calm
61:54 please go there are all the audio and
61:56 video that you need there's a locked
61:58 Facebook group with a few folks in it
62:00 was a patreon page in case you want to
62:01 contribute take care of yourself and
62:04 someone else and I'll see in the next
62:06 tube thoughts over now
