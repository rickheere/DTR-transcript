00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:33 deep thoughts today I'm gonna go over a
00:39 subject that was sort of spawned by an
00:41 interesting methodology which is
00:43 watching the television show American
00:46 Gods what a crazy freakin show this is I
00:51 just finished the first season today and
00:54 started the second season and I really
00:58 don't want to ruin any part of it for
00:59 you even attempting to explain it will
01:04 just confuse you and that's not because
01:06 you're not super intelligent it's just
01:07 because the show is like nothing I've
01:11 ever seen in my life it is the matrix
01:15 meets the prophecy movie meets carnival
01:21 meets its own storyline it's based on a
01:24 book and so there's a lot of there's a
01:31 lot of talk about gods in the show let's
01:33 just put it that way and how beliefs
01:36 sort of held beliefs in man create gods
01:41 and they're not saying gods aren't real
01:44 in that show they just don't adhere to a
01:47 single God in that show but it got me
01:52 thinking because there's one little
01:57 nugget of truth that I keep well my
02:02 version is an opinion of truth and I
02:04 think it's actually fairly provable in
02:07 the psyche of man through at least
02:08 anthropological studies and especially
02:10 Joseph Campbell's studies but as we
02:13 close out season 4 here I just want to
02:15 cover it on point and it has to do with
02:21 man's need to create gods to deal with
02:25 things they don't understand that's
02:26 always been the reason why we create
02:28 gods and that's one of the lines in the
02:29 show and it's nothing terribly profound
02:32 it's something that a lot of again folks
02:35 that study ancient history and the
02:38 development of gods
02:40 in the psyche of man come to the
02:42 conclusion of and it's interesting
02:45 because we have that weakness we have
02:47 that again fear of the unknown I've got
02:49 an episode called the unknown I've got
02:51 tons of episodes that kind of beat
02:52 around the bush with this subject matter
02:54 and it's unfortunate because I think we
02:57 need to get stronger because what's
03:00 happening is once we create a bad form
03:06 of God it's it goes a little bit like
03:12 this when man finds men vulnerable
03:18 mankind finds himself or herself
03:21 vulnerable we have to make sense of
03:23 something otherwise we tend to fear that
03:25 we're going to go crazy that the the
03:27 moment that we can understand the loss
03:29 of a loved one the fact that we're all
03:31 starving because there's a famine or
03:33 whatever the reason is we're not happy
03:37 and we feel like we deserve to be happy
03:39 or something tragic happened which is
03:43 why we're not happy and it's so tragic
03:44 we can't understand why that would
03:46 happen you know back in the days we
03:47 didn't have you know these FF events
03:50 that are orchestrated by governments
03:52 against the people to create false
03:54 narratives I mean that that does go back
03:56 far enough that even in The Princess
03:58 Bride they talked about this being a
04:01 long and prestigious career of faking
04:04 things so that the people believe that
04:06 they're at war with someone or to
04:07 instigate anger in the people so that
04:10 the king or queen can get what they want
04:12 which is they want to take someone
04:13 else's land but they and they know they
04:15 got enough people to do it but then
04:17 other people are good they don't hate
04:18 the other people and so they create
04:21 these false events okay but doesn't take
04:24 that at all to start these beliefs in
04:29 creators and what have you now we for
04:32 various reasons on the show let's just
04:34 say I'm always dragging you into my
04:37 beliefs I'm sorry you know I personally
04:39 believe that there's a lot of reasons to
04:41 give credence to something that is at
04:45 the origin of our very own existence and
04:47 again
04:49 the infinite one episode just released
04:52 it's sort of where my mind is right now
04:54 which is there's one of us and we keep
04:56 coming back in the same timeline and
04:59 that's why there doesn't need to be an
05:02 infinite anything there's only one
05:06 number there's only one person there's
05:08 only one soul and it is the illusion of
05:11 time that facilitates this notion that
05:14 we are many not we as in one but we as
05:18 in plural were all different and because
05:20 we are churned out in a snow like
05:23 fashion the snowflake like fashion
05:25 excuse me we all are very different
05:27 because there's even a mod agostic twins
05:29 are different they grow up different
05:31 they think different they have different
05:32 behaviors even though they might be
05:34 studied by some sociological professor
05:37 and find out that they are very similar
05:39 and how they pick their wives or
05:40 whatever or husbands they still are
05:44 unique but here's the the thrust of this
05:50 show and the reason why I'm making this
05:52 my my gripe with the way that things get
05:59 handled with creating gods is that it
06:03 typically gets usurped by those that
06:06 recognize it's controlling force on man
06:08 let's say you have a village let's go
06:11 way back in time before anything super
06:13 modern is there there's no money
06:14 changers there's no Masons there's no
06:16 nothing we are literally a tribe maybe
06:20 we're nomadic doesn't matter we have
06:21 figured out where to get our food we
06:23 figured out where to go in the summer
06:24 versus the winter like the Shoshone
06:26 Indians that went in a big circle but
06:30 things are happening you know children
06:31 died and and things happen people get
06:35 sick too soon birthing is dangerous it
06:38 really wasn't that dangerous until the
06:39 Rockefellers told you it was dangerous
06:40 but someone creates something you know
06:47 imagine a husband and wife and they're
06:50 pregnant and it's way back in the day
06:52 and for whatever reason they don't
06:54 understand the medical imperative of
06:56 raising a child our genetics and our
06:58 instincts are still forming this
07:00 probably wasn't the case
07:01 [Music]
07:03 because you know you know insects can
07:05 figure this stuff out but let's say
07:07 there's a little burp where there's
07:08 something we've moved to a new location
07:10 and there's something that is killing
07:13 our offspring quickly and it's not an
07:14 animal it's some sort of pollen or some
07:17 sort of poison that we're feeding and
07:19 the adults can eat it and be okay and
07:20 the kids eat it and they die so this
07:23 happens now a husband is looking at his
07:26 wife his partner and let's just say
07:31 there's some bond there and they care he
07:34 sees her suffering could be her
07:37 girlfriend who sees her suffering she's
07:40 lost her child there's an amazing old
07:42 video that's probably 3040 years old
07:44 where a monkey lost its its baby and it
07:47 carried around the body for quite a
07:49 while until it finally released it about
07:51 a week later so this is really deep and
07:56 we don't want our loved one to suffer
07:58 and we know that technically speaking we
08:00 can make another child so when and the
08:03 mind's eye of one both both partners
08:05 would be suffering let's just say but
08:07 one of them says you know what I have an
08:10 instinct to have this feeling and we go
08:13 on to a better place you see those stars
08:15 those are the gods and they have taken
08:18 our child up there and our child is now
08:21 a star see that star right there that
08:23 wasn't there yesterday oh really no no
08:24 it wasn't there was it it wasn't there
08:26 was it guys and everybody's like no no
08:28 no it wasn't there your once chiming in
08:30 to make this thing happen and they forge
08:33 a God a belief in gods
08:34 that's how the Native Americans used to
08:36 believe about their loved ones they
08:39 turned into stars
08:40 it's just beautiful right now that's
08:44 good and we have this methodology to get
08:47 through these hard times if it happens
08:50 again in front of the woman that lost
08:52 her first child and see she never loses
08:53 another child just ten more and it's all
08:56 good but what are her daughter's has a
08:58 problem same problem
09:00 loses one of her young and she consoles
09:04 her daughter and she points up with the
09:06 Stars and she said you know what happens
09:07 when you lose one of your own they
09:10 become immortal and you see that star
09:12 right there that wasn't there yesterday
09:14 that is our that's my grandson and
09:16 that's your son or that's my
09:17 granddaughter and that's your daughter
09:19 thank you mama
09:21 you know and in life goes on now I don't
09:26 know of any corruption that happened
09:27 with belief systems in the
09:29 native-american world but the white folk
09:31 got really into controlling religion and
09:35 soon it became a business of extortion
09:37 ISM you know Rome set it up from the
09:41 very beginning to be a method of
09:43 controlling and taxing I've said it a
09:46 hundred times on the show so when they
09:50 figure out they can control you they
09:53 give you rosaries and all this other
09:55 stuff that means you're busy that means
09:57 you're repentant now and you're gonna be
10:00 good and you're gonna do what Caesar
10:01 says and you're gonna pay on the Caesar
10:02 what is his guess who wrote that [ __ ]
10:05 line right it ain't God and it ain't
10:08 Jesus when this goes on to the point
10:11 they can rape our kids to the point they
10:14 can beat our kids and what happens to a
10:17 guy like George Carlin all these
10:20 philosophers that end up hating
10:22 Christianity and going against
10:23 Christianity there may not be any truth
10:27 to it at all other than the metaphorical
10:29 truth of this is how to be good to each
10:31 other and these are sort of things that
10:33 God would do from time to time the Bible
10:34 gets it so simplified in its allegory
10:37 it's hard to deny its truth and its
10:40 wisdom especially the moral compass that
10:42 isn't in is viewed on man once man gets
10:45 into this but now here's what's
10:49 interesting because I haven't made this
10:52 connection in words all in one sentence
10:57 and I want you Christians to hear this
10:59 but I want anyone to believe who's
11:01 believing in a religion to hear this if
11:05 you want to understand how I view
11:08 Christianity it is sort of how maybe you
11:12 view science with the capital S the
11:15 science of all the lies of the world you
11:18 might be watching science the neil
11:20 degrasse tyson's
11:21 the bill nye the douchebag guy they are
11:25 lying to the people about how many
11:27 genders humanity has whether or not what
11:29 [ __ ] shape the earth is right no grant
11:32 no the grass Tyson cannot figure it out
11:33 it's either a pear or its elliptical
11:36 oblique severe sphere right they lie to
11:41 us about everything well gravity is all
11:44 this stuff
11:45 and you look at them and you're like
11:46 those scumbags are the biggest [ __ ]
11:49 Liars on planet earth how do they have
11:52 so much power how do they end up on all
11:54 these zulan or part twos and and and all
11:57 these shows how does Bill night without
11:59 a science degree claim to be a science
12:02 authority and teach your children to get
12:05 all of their messages screwed up in
12:07 terms of what's a boy and what's a girl
12:10 how does Al Gore how core with no
12:14 empirical proof that his [ __ ]
12:17 climate change is real can't predict if
12:19 it rains tomorrow but this guy's got a
12:21 [ __ ] hockey stick graph that says the
12:23 world is getting you know so hot that
12:25 Montecito is gonna be under water then
12:27 he buys a house there and he's still in
12:28 there today and it's nine years passed
12:30 when you said it would be under water
12:31 and it's fine how does this happen it's
12:36 because science is starting to a
12:37 religion it's the unthinkable religion
12:40 you would never really perceive as a
12:42 child at least in the 70s and 80s like
12:45 when I was a kid and perceive it as an
12:47 ever turning into a religion it can't
12:49 turn into religion but I have friends of
12:52 mine who are extremely good people but
12:54 do anything for you I mean they truly
12:56 are the best people on planet earth but
12:58 they have now given up on Christianity
13:02 and they post memes online and articles
13:05 online about if you don't believe in
13:08 science you are the biggest threat to
13:10 humanity and it's all full of that [ __ ]
13:12 vaccinations are [ __ ] great for you
13:14 got no Pharma background whatsoever no
13:17 chemistry background whatsoever couldn't
13:19 name anything inside of a vaccination if
13:20 they had a gun against their head so you
13:22 have a big hole in their head when it's
13:24 all over I don't know oh you want my kid
13:27 to [ __ ] take that stuff not even your
13:28 kid you mean how many kids yet the
13:31 amount of [ __ ] millenials you have no
13:33 children we're out there preaching that
13:36 all the kids of the world are gonna you
13:37 know
13:38 need this stuff it's unbelievable again
13:41 they're getting tattoos on their faces
13:43 before they understand what forever
13:44 means but they're not even getting the
13:46 tattoos on their face themselves they're
13:48 suggesting you get a tattoo on your face
13:50 your kid get a tattoo on their face that
13:52 forever decision there forever medical
13:55 decision to destroy the brain of a child
13:57 so they have ADHD ad D all these
14:01 bipolarism things and so your kid
14:06 immediately goes in on the system right
14:09 a child unvaccinated grows up to be a
14:12 strong human being one because they
14:14 catch all the illnesses are supposed to
14:15 catch building up all the natural
14:18 antibodies but they stay healthy in the
14:20 mind because their mind was never
14:21 attacked they don't have aluminum and
14:23 Mercury injected into the brain cavity
14:24 ripping apart the coax that protects the
14:28 neurons keeping them out of dementia
14:31 give you them out of Alzheimer's and all
14:32 this other stuff but the second they're
14:34 vaccinated they become a patient of the
14:37 medical system their entire life it's a
14:40 business people so when a religion goes
14:43 bad in the science world it's actually
14:46 pretty easy to see the problems it's not
14:50 actually getting warm around it's not
14:52 it's getting colder out the ice caps are
14:54 growing at record levels right now but
14:56 they'll still tell you it's bad because
14:58 they've changed it from global warming
14:59 which was a huge [ __ ] lie over to
15:01 climate change meaning they could take
15:03 credit for anything again it's like my
15:06 buddy in high school was a devil
15:07 worshiper for about a year and
15:08 everything that happened bad in high
15:10 school he just took credit for it it was
15:12 him and Beelzebub [ __ ] breaking
15:15 people's legs and arms and car racks and
15:17 stuff he took all responsibility for
15:18 that now he's lucky that no one really
15:21 knew he was doing that the and MIT we
15:23 weren't in the 1800s because if he was
15:25 running his [ __ ] mouth like that in
15:26 1850 they would have taken him out and
15:29 hung his ass for [ __ ] real broke his
15:32 [ __ ] neck probably burned his ashes
15:35 probably created some goddamn seance
15:36 over his body to send him to hell its
15:39 lucky he did that [ __ ] in the 80s as a
15:41 fool now there's a lot of churches now
15:44 that exist outside of the Catholic
15:46 religion and those people in my
15:48 experience live full
15:51 in life's and they don't have all this
15:53 weird SuperDuper guilt and they even
15:55 changed between churches there might be
15:56 a Baptist for two or three decades and
15:59 they become a Methodist then become
16:00 Episcopalian they become a latter-day
16:02 saints of Jesus Christ people right in
16:04 the Mormons all right so here's the
16:08 thing the point I'm trying to make is we
16:12 have to be extremely careful with how we
16:16 take in religion and how we apply it and
16:20 one of the best things that I can
16:21 describe that I have seen and I've
16:24 practiced in my own life is the old
16:27 adage when you're at the dinner table
16:29 you never talk about two things politics
16:31 and religion and the idea is well in
16:36 this day and age people get rarely
16:40 informed about politics right they want
16:43 to have their thought process and they
16:45 want to be on the good side they don't
16:47 really have the intellectual capacity to
16:48 study science and so they just post
16:51 those [ __ ] things online right and
16:53 and same with politics politics just I
16:56 got a party line cops are bad meaning
16:59 the name Nate right we're religion
17:02 because we're raised with whatever we're
17:03 raised with from birth the interesting
17:06 thing is is we can get pretty informed
17:08 as kids and stay fairly up to date on
17:11 what's in the Bible why because it
17:12 doesn't change it's a fixed document how
17:15 its interpreted is different but you
17:18 know generally be good to other people
17:20 and that's for a thing but what happens
17:22 in my circle but now how would most of
17:26 you have successfully adopted religion
17:27 in your life practice it you practice it
17:31 by practicing it by yourself now you
17:34 might go to church with your family and
17:35 that sort of thing and that's fine and
17:37 you're going to be teaching your kids
17:39 what you believe especially the stuff
17:40 that's actually worked out for you
17:41 really well but you have your family and
17:45 no matter how much you teach your child
17:46 you know your child is developing their
17:48 own opinions about this stuff even your
17:50 spouse is different than you but you try
17:54 to make ends meet so to speak with
18:00 religion whatever works best is what you
18:03 keep
18:04 but now here's the second part of this
18:07 this whole episode which is the
18:09 following a bad religion but the few
18:13 passages of repression or oppression
18:16 with some sort of exclusivity starts to
18:22 create the world that we're in right now
18:24 it starts to facilitate war right and we
18:29 obviously need that to stop now I'm
18:34 gonna go out on a limb this is a crazy
18:38 notion I'm sure but the notion I'm gonna
18:41 suggest is with religion now the
18:45 politics there's a lot of things at
18:47 stake right now so and there's a lot of
18:49 lies out there a lot of fake news and
18:51 it's this it is we'll go to two
18:56 different realms right now in America
18:58 and especially in Britain and in Europe
19:00 your politics are going to either
19:01 determine whether or not you're in a
19:03 dystopian monarchy fascist [ __ ]
19:06 planet in in ten years or whether or not
19:08 you're going to ever see the light of
19:10 day you whether or not you ever gonna
19:11 see sovereignty and freedom reintroduce
19:13 itself into this world true sovereignty
19:15 right with religion on earth hmm well we
19:20 got a bunch of Christian groups of all
19:22 different kinds traveling the world
19:24 doing missionary work trying to get
19:26 people to believe in what they believe
19:28 what I'm unaware of as any Christian
19:31 group that's going in with guns like the
19:33 old inquisitions and saying if you don't
19:35 believe we're gonna kill you right now
19:37 but what we do have is this tiny sect of
19:42 the Muslim world Islamic world I should
19:45 say excuse me that is making propaganda
19:50 they're making videos and they are
19:52 flat-out telling you it's a tiny tiny
19:55 speck of people that's ruining it for
19:58 the whole Muslim nation of the world
20:00 everybody is Muslim in the world they're
20:02 ruining it for them but there's a catch
20:04 to that I've seen a video you know I've
20:08 seen probably a dozen clerics in Europe
20:11 a lot of them living in England saying
20:15 we're going to eventually take you over
20:17 your
20:18 actually going to surrender to Allah
20:19 there will be no Jesus Christ and if you
20:21 do not surrender to Allah we're gonna
20:22 kill you we have the recent video the
20:24 little girls reading from this thing and
20:26 saying you know we're gonna cut your
20:29 [ __ ] heads off if you don't follow
20:30 Islamic religion now the horrible thing
20:34 about that is there's some [ __ ]
20:35 parent out there teaching these kids
20:36 this kind of intolerance but now I'll
20:40 think about this if someone let's say
20:44 there's that crazy crazy Christian group
20:46 I think they're largely disbanded now
20:48 there's this [ __ ] inbred goddamn
20:50 family in Topeka Kansas
20:51 that's the they're the family to go out
20:54 that goes out that went out I should say
20:56 in the past and they stood around you
20:58 know our soldiers bodies coming back
21:00 from various wars and saying that God
21:02 killed them because of homosexuality
21:04 tolerance and all this other stuff but
21:08 what happened in the United States is
21:10 that when that started happening all the
21:13 99.9999% of the rest of the Christians
21:16 no matter if you came from Baptists
21:18 Lutheran you know Catholic Church all
21:22 came out and denounced those people and
21:24 said we're not like that that's [ __ ]
21:25 those people are [ __ ] they're idiots
21:28 just look at them they got about ten
21:30 teeth between the whole family right
21:32 we're not quite sure they're not all
21:33 related I mean to this day I'm not sure
21:36 that grandpa Lee and everybody's dad you
21:39 know I haven't seen that group in
21:41 probably 10 years but they were so
21:43 horrible so horrible that every wooden
21:46 denounced them so I've gotten a you know
21:49 my smoked lunch especially we have
21:51 people who come by every once a while
21:54 who are either Arab by blood descent and
21:58 they don't really practice any they're
22:00 not Muslim they're not Islamic they're
22:02 not but they have to watch stuff on the
22:04 television every once in a while when
22:07 this stuff comes through and they're
22:08 embarrassed they're like this is why
22:10 it's hard for me did you show my face
22:13 anywhere this is why it's hard for me to
22:14 tell anybody I'm of Egyptian descent I
22:17 don't I don't vote for that crap I don't
22:20 have anything to do with this I want to
22:21 be circumcised one of them's a girl that
22:23 comes to our lounge in does hookah she's
22:26 got to see all this stuff and go jeez
22:27 you know that's not me and we all know
22:30 she doesn't need to say anything
22:31 but now where is and I have seen some
22:34 about 10 years ago I saw some after that
22:36 day in September 11th there was some
22:38 folks that came out and clarified which
22:40 was fantastic but YouTube's a free
22:43 platform where is the viral video the
22:48 50000 viral videos the 50 million viral
22:51 videos of people of Arab descent her
22:54 maybe even Muslim maybe even Islamic
22:56 coming out and saying we don't have
22:59 anything to do with this we're not gonna
23:00 cut your heads off this is [ __ ]
23:01 we'll fight next to you to keep this
23:04 this evil out we don't want our
23:06 daughters castrated we don't we don't
23:08 believe that a man chill to kill his
23:10 wife nor grandpa marrying some
23:12 eight-year-old kid we don't believe in
23:13 any dad's stuff we're not German
23:17 we're not English we're not American
23:19 we're still Muslim we're still believe
23:22 in a flavor of Islam that isn't evil but
23:27 we don't see that so the one religion on
23:31 this planet that is out to kill
23:32 everybody is this tiny little group of
23:34 people so that's where religion if made
23:38 badly can cause gigantic problems for
23:41 society the politics of the day is that
23:46 now the deep state is making their final
23:48 play they get a second and third play
23:50 trust me but they're trying to make the
23:53 play they are trying to keep out anyone
23:56 who's talking about sovereignty England
23:57 is not to leave the EU Scotland is not
23:59 to leave England and America is to be
24:02 disarmed and whatever whole sailed out
24:05 to the Clinton Foundation luckily that
24:09 stuff has been halted for now a lot of
24:11 it our religion made badly think about
24:15 it let's talk about some more religions
24:18 that we don't really call religious but
24:19 they are religious because their methods
24:21 by which people live their lifes they
24:22 wake up in the day they start ingesting
24:25 this content these methods of living and
24:26 then they go and become this
24:30 personification of this weird religion
24:33 you got and I'm not trying to pick on
24:36 any one race or anything like that but
24:38 you know let's go for the let's go for
24:40 the the old eighties archetype
24:44 so really when club 54 in New York was
24:48 was literally fueled by one of our five
24:52 I organizations to glorify cocaine use
24:56 cocaine was extremely expensive it
24:58 wasn't actually expensive to build but
25:00 their to make but they they blew it up
25:02 as a really expensive thing making it
25:03 seem like you got a sacrifice and steal
25:05 all your you know family's materials so
25:08 heirlooms to pay for bags of coke or
25:10 whatever they blew up the sensation
25:13 thing where if you're rich you get to do
25:15 cocaine and then they cooked it down to
25:18 crack cocaine and pushed it into the
25:19 ghettos so why people go first as a pure
25:23 stuff and they say just infiltrate these
25:25 ghettos but what carried it into the 90s
25:29 rock and roll now rock and what was in
25:31 the 70s - and the plenty of cocaine
25:33 going on back in the day but boy there
25:35 was I know these guys and they did
25:36 pounds of that [ __ ] and heroin came into
25:38 the game Nikki Sixx getting everybody
25:40 strung out on this [ __ ] all right more
25:45 religions what else happened well in the
25:47 eighties like I've been kind of going in
25:51 a circle here but I kind of want to
25:52 leave you with this sort of frequency
25:54 when you come out of season four because
25:57 I don't think I'm gonna repeat this in
25:59 season five at all
26:01 but you know look at the gangster
26:03 mentality how many times have you heard
26:06 little you know sayings that are
26:09 something like gangster for life man
26:10 gangster for lab and a game for life I'm
26:13 gangsta this gangster that most these
26:16 guys end up in prison or dead women end
26:20 up in prison or dead or they end up with
26:22 kids with no fathers fathers would be
26:25 the father's but they're in jail
26:27 gangster life forever tattoos all over
26:29 their face and [ __ ] gangsters for life
26:33 it's a religion there's that you know
26:36 Bad Religion was there bein called Bad
26:39 Religion the bad religions start to mess
26:42 with the fabric of society but now how
26:45 does anyone get addicted to a religion
26:47 why does anyone get addicted to religion
26:49 hmm why does a kid join a gang because
26:53 I'm gonna go for gangs first so you
26:54 understand how
26:56 churches happen would you say that a kid
27:00 that joins a gang has their whole life
27:02 figured out and they just decide to join
27:05 a gang as this empirical step to their
27:07 success did they feel like they're part
27:09 of a group before they get into a gang
27:12 are they self-aware are they enlightened
27:15 before they get into these gangs or did
27:18 they feel lost unloved they have no
27:22 friends for whatever reason their world
27:26 claustrophobics them together right
27:28 compresses them down and the only way to
27:31 have a little bit of you know
27:37 camaraderie and love and honor in this
27:39 world is to find people like them who
27:41 want the same exact thing the problem is
27:44 these 5i guys take drugs in there you
27:47 got to sell this stuff you got to get
27:48 addicted to it and you got to sell it
27:50 and you got to sell it because you're
27:51 gonna get it at a discount anyway
27:52 because you're a dealer and you're going
27:54 to have your stash and you're gonna sell
27:57 it I knew a girl that spent some time in
28:02 jail she was talking she was hooked on
28:05 methamphetamines and she got so addicted
28:08 she's sort of a beautiful family she had
28:11 still addicted to it ends up selling it
28:13 because that's the only way to get her
28:14 stuff for free technically speaking
28:16 eventually gets busted for manufacturing
28:20 and selling alrighty
28:24 how many of you know a friend that was
28:28 reborn into Christianity you know they
28:32 were raised with it everyone in America
28:33 is raised with it pretty much at least
28:35 thirty years ago or more but they got
28:39 lost they never paid attention to
28:41 religion like me as a kid they got lost
28:44 and then they found religion now some of
28:48 us can do that and you know keep it to
28:50 yourself you have your beliefs in God
28:53 you can discuss it sort of lightly with
28:55 your friends but you know the more you
28:57 discuss religion and your more than you
28:59 parse the Bible you can be in Bible
29:02 studies where it's actually fairly
29:03 amicable your differences are nickel
29:05 Bowl but there's a reason why they say
29:08 don't discuss it at the dinner tape
29:10 it's because it can lead to serious
29:13 serious disagreements I have one person
29:17 in my family
29:18 I've submission her a couple times lived
29:21 a completely secular life no church at
29:23 all when it came time to get a job and
29:26 get into the real world she was
29:29 terrified she got her degree didn't
29:33 really help her get a job then she got
29:35 married to a guy who was SuperDuper into
29:37 the church he's a great guy his family's
29:40 great and I'm not sure the family I mean
29:44 I assume that there guiding her along
29:46 her her path at one point but at one
29:49 point she came home to her dad and said
29:53 you're going to hell dad and he's like
29:57 well really why am I going to hell
29:59 because you drink wine this dude has one
30:02 glass of wine at night back in the day
30:04 maybe two who gives a [ __ ] but what did
30:06 [ __ ] Jesus turned water into started
30:08 it into wine [ __ ] and you're
30:11 gonna go and tell a guy he's going to
30:12 hell what is wrong she's a [ __ ] for
30:17 one thing she couldn't do basic math and
30:20 find out that her Savior preferred wine
30:23 when there was a wedding and there
30:25 wasn't enough wine to go around marry
30:28 Jesus's mother and the fictional story
30:30 of this guy went to him and said dude
30:32 there's not enough wine to go around you
30:34 know turning his barrels of water into
30:36 wine he's only yeah whatever mom and he
30:38 did it right forever for what 19 hundred
30:42 years of this fictional story it really
30:44 it's probably about 1500 of people
30:46 actually practicing it when you took the
30:48 the sacrament would you wash it down
30:51 with you washed it down with wine and
30:54 yet this genius went around telling her
30:56 father she was going to hell and then of
30:57 course all of us are going to hell she
31:00 was going from zero to hero in her own
31:02 mind
31:02 she knew deep down inside she was a
31:05 complete loser
31:06 and so her way of becoming a winner was
31:10 to send everybody to hell and it's just
31:13 her her husband and their family and
31:15 their little [ __ ] country bumpkin
31:16 Church are gonna go and see what the
31:18 prison gates look like and everyone else
31:20 is gonna be sitting on the devil's lap
31:24 hmm a lost person with a low IQ found
31:29 salvation their damning everyone else to
31:32 hell and she's just one example but I'm
31:34 telling you I know about I know a ton of
31:36 people like this all right there one of
31:40 you knows every single one of you I
31:42 think knows one person just like that
31:44 it's a [ __ ] way to live life
31:47 so what's funny is is you get folks in
31:50 their religion whether it be science
31:52 right my friends who are barely in
31:55 they're barely twenty five years old
31:56 posting this crap online like their [ __ ]
31:58 and you know 50 years old 80 years old
32:01 with all his wisdom they had no wisdom
32:03 whatsoever and they're posting a meme to
32:05 do what to make them feel better and
32:08 smart right they don't read the science
32:10 articles they don't do any research and
32:12 anything but they post it to feel smart
32:14 that's what idiots do they buy books and
32:17 put them on the shelf so when you come
32:18 over you're like oh my god you're on
32:19 that book oh yeah oh gosh what's that
32:21 about all they can repeat it the
32:23 footnotes they've read online that
32:25 what's written inside the jacket of the
32:27 book or what they have heard the book is
32:29 popular for and they pretend they've
32:31 read it and the funny thing is when a
32:34 guy like me comes in he goes it really
32:35 hmm
32:37 I'll ask him some super deep-rooted
32:40 question in the book that you can't know
32:41 unless you read the read the book and I
32:44 got books that I haven't read not that
32:47 many but when someone comes over and
32:50 goes wow what about that book and I'm
32:51 like you know I bought that thing you
32:53 haven't had a chance to read it I don't
32:54 know anything about that book have you
32:56 read it tell me because maybe whatever
32:58 you tell them it'll get me to pull that
33:00 thing off put in my bedroom and start
33:02 reading it at night it's important but
33:05 what's interesting about religion for me
33:07 is that this is important as far as the
33:09 subatomic you know physics of the Bible
33:12 which is that you can ask a person who's
33:14 a devout Christian and I'm not saying
33:18 get rid of Christianity I'm just saying
33:19 maybe you just keep it a little bit more
33:20 to yourself because we don't know
33:23 everything right but this is one of the
33:24 reasons why you may want to just hold
33:26 off there on the old I know everything
33:28 about the Bible thing because I know
33:29 guys that can recite that thing
33:32 chapter and verse I mean it's phenomenal
33:35 and we get in conversations that are
33:36 just
33:37 dropping those verses and man that
33:38 they're all on point you know it's crazy
33:40 it's beautiful but they will tell you
33:42 that the out Liguori in the Bible can be
33:45 interpreted several different ways which
33:47 is why it's so utterly powerful and some
33:50 passages will literally be black and
33:52 white you know it means one thing one
33:53 interpretation and completely opposite
33:55 and other interpretation but supposedly
33:58 in this super flexible book there's only
34:01 one way anything works like wait a
34:04 minute here you just said I can you know
34:06 this goes one way this goes the other
34:08 way and but there's only one way and I'm
34:10 not going your way at this point in time
34:12 because you need to feel superior to me
34:13 so you pick the way that I'm not going
34:14 so you win I lose and you go home at
34:17 night with your chest all puffed up is
34:20 that creating tolerance is that creating
34:23 something that God would be a part of
34:24 mmm-hmm
34:26 what if we're God this is a good time to
34:30 mention too that you know so many
34:32 brilliant philosophers out there have
34:34 had the time and the money to sit inside
34:37 these research institutions whether they
34:40 be Greek universities 3,000 years ago
34:44 they're 2500 years ago at least spending
34:47 your whole life sin in philosophy
34:49 breaking this apart and you know if you
34:52 say well that was before Jesus it was
34:54 like okay again by the time Plato was
34:58 born there's ten Jesus Christ's that
35:01 have gone through the system but you
35:03 don't need more than one to have gone
35:05 through the system for Plato to make a
35:07 full observation on this virgin birth
35:10 death or resurrection thing so a guy
35:13 like that just reads it takes it in and
35:15 then studies everything else it's going
35:16 all the idol worship and all that kind
35:18 of stuff and then they come out at the
35:21 end of their lifes and go you know what
35:22 I learned I didn't know a single thing
35:24 my entire life I had my opinions at
35:27 times my 40s I believe one thing my 20s
35:30 I believed a different thing my eighties
35:31 not so much but we don't learn from
35:35 these people enough that's why I like my
35:41 definition it was well it's not my
35:43 definition but when I finally had the
35:46 belief of agnostic describe
35:50 to me as being sort of look I have my
35:54 definite Inklings that this particular
35:56 passage is probably more true than false
35:58 but I just don't know exactly what
36:02 happens at these various points and you
36:04 know God's God's plan whether were God
36:08 whether there's only one dude he's out
36:10 there whether or not he's militant and
36:12 violent like so many passages of the
36:14 Bible saying I like that because at
36:18 least we're always in a research and
36:20 development process we're always
36:21 incubating our beliefs and I think
36:23 that's just the way it has to be for now
36:26 and so we until we experience again the
36:31 faith faithless phase of a Jesus coming
36:36 to earth and being God on earth if it
36:39 happened in our time the difference is
36:41 again the Apostles needed zero faith no
36:45 faith at all why they got to see God if
36:48 that story is true they got to see God I
36:51 got to talk to the dude they got to ask
36:54 him questions I mean you know the Bible
36:56 is pretty thick but the New Testament is
36:57 only about a third at the end if even
36:59 that but they got to sit with the guy we
37:02 don't have those meetings transcribed if
37:05 they truly occurred what was what was
37:07 discussed at the Last Supper you got a
37:09 few little passages in the Bible but if
37:12 they even sat there if they even sat
37:14 with Christ okay for a single day
37:18 starting around 10:00 a.m. and they
37:20 didn't stop eating and sharing and
37:23 breaking bread until 10 o'clock at night
37:25 and you transcribed those 12 hours of
37:29 conversation and they got a lot more
37:31 than 12 according to the story the head
37:34 thousands of hours with this guy okay
37:38 that book for a single day would be
37:41 larger than the entire New Testament
37:42 because all we got is Matthew Mark Luke
37:44 John when it comes to Christ's story now
37:47 Paul goes off on this you know
37:50 tange it writing a bunch of letters and
37:51 then of course they think of John wrote
37:53 revelations may not be the same John is
37:56 in the first book
37:59 you know the Matthew Mark Luke John part
38:01 of it so they got all the information
38:04 all the goods and they weren't stupid if
38:07 they existed it was it Matthew was a tax
38:11 collector he was a baller according to
38:14 the Bible he owned a big mansion he
38:16 threw gigantic parties he was a who's
38:19 who because everyone's nice to the guy
38:21 he's collecting taxes for Caesar hmm how
38:25 do the guinea if it's true but when
38:28 you're in a public place when you're in
38:30 a situation where we need tolerance when
38:32 you need someone to cut you some slack
38:34 because you messed up maybe you were
38:35 truly a jerk maybe you just had an
38:38 accident of some sort maybe you're not
38:41 the predominant race in your
38:43 neighborhood maybe you're not the gender
38:47 that's allowed to do certain things and
38:50 the society that you are what is it that
38:52 you really want someone to get out of
38:54 the Bible
38:56 goodness a moral compass patience
39:00 tolerance and love love really is all
39:04 those things you have love for your
39:06 fellow man you know it doesn't mean you
39:09 won't complain about how they drive
39:10 every once in a while but it doesn't
39:12 mean you wants to happen in the face
39:13 either it's just wow you know this
39:17 person's having a bad day so am i and
39:19 it's starting to rub me wrong but you
39:21 know the next day you'll get a good
39:23 night's sleep and everything will be
39:26 better the next day you reset I mean how
39:30 many times do you get in your car for
39:33 having a bad day of driving and then you
39:35 adopt that the second you get in your
39:36 car you don't believe me I Drive in Los
39:40 Angeles I don't get in my car in the
39:42 morning going it's gonna be horrible
39:43 today I don't think that I just say oh
39:45 well I hope it's pretty good today so
39:49 again in my layman's understanding of my
39:53 methodology of dealing with religion I
39:55 get a chance to talk about it on this
39:57 show so you guys have literally the most
39:59 unprecedented portfolio of my beliefs
40:03 and it's funny because if you don't
40:06 watch all these shows nobody knows
40:08 necessarily what I believe my closest
40:10 friends my specialty
40:11 my family my family is hardly religious
40:13 at all they they grow less and less
40:16 religious but what's interesting is is
40:18 my family that grew up in the Catholic
40:19 Church and I've got a couple of
40:23 relatives that are still very devout and
40:25 you know I still have an aunt that will
40:29 everyone I don't know she's calmed down
40:31 because I think her kids grew up and
40:33 we're kind of like busting her chops and
40:36 saying look mom we're tired of hearing
40:37 this [ __ ] we're going to hell if
40:39 that's the way you're gonna be then
40:40 we're not gonna come home and she just
40:42 lightened up and that's what I heard
40:43 which is good but there's this massive
40:46 guilt I'm telling you man the Catholic
40:50 Church has an absolute patent on
40:53 installing guilt into a human being it
40:56 is unlike any religion I have ever heard
40:58 in my life and again I haven't traveled
41:00 the entire planet and talked a bunch of
41:02 radical folks in different religions but
41:05 man in America that is all controlling
41:08 but I have met hundreds if not thousands
41:12 of human beings in America who are in
41:14 all the other Catholic Church or sorry
41:16 Christian churches and they if they if I
41:19 find them and they've decided to take a
41:21 break from going to church they don't
41:25 sit around crying and and apologizing to
41:28 me passively for their inner guilt they
41:32 just say look you're nice to go to
41:33 church a lot and kind I just needed to
41:35 take a break from it you know about four
41:37 years ago I did it a girl who had told
41:42 me that the subject of religion came up
41:45 and and she started apologize she didn't
41:48 sorry she started telling me how she
41:50 wasn't going to church as much anymore
41:52 and I didn't give her any alkaloids and
41:55 say oh that's great I just said okay
41:57 that's cool you know whatever it was
41:59 good for you it's good and so we spent
42:01 about eight months together and we're
42:03 getting closer and closer and closer
42:05 together I mean really just getting
42:06 almost to the point of like moving in
42:08 together and probably going to the next
42:10 level but you know what destroyed our
42:13 relationship she went back to the church
42:17 she went back to the church and I've
42:21 been to her church dozens of times
42:24 and I didn't find anything in her church
42:26 that was intolerant that was telling her
42:30 to do anything against me by even even
42:33 metaphorically they were extremely
42:35 progressive cool Church I mean honestly
42:38 if they were really close by I might
42:39 even visit them from time to time in
42:42 fact some of the Bible studies I've
42:43 shared with you guys some of the sermons
42:45 that were essentially Bible studies over
42:47 every Sunday but she somehow interpreted
42:51 that whole thing slowly over time I
42:53 could see it he's started creeping in
42:55 this sort of she would say us meaning
43:00 her church and her it was just her and
43:03 me and part of it once I even talked
43:07 about the sacrifices I make making these
43:09 shows part of it was the only time her
43:13 and I ever had any sort of disagreement
43:15 was I was doing the other show MKULTRA
43:17 radio and she would listen to it at work
43:20 and again my co-host is someone she did
43:24 everything against him but she probably
43:26 wouldn't date the guy because he's much
43:27 different than her you know he's a gun
43:30 slinging rock and roller Man and you
43:33 know you know have our similarities for
43:34 sure but no I was dating her because I'm
43:38 compatible with her but she would listen
43:40 to something and pick out a little thing
43:42 here and there and she would just she
43:47 would she but just kind of lock up at
43:48 dinner after dinner was over I put her
43:50 kid to bed and she could well you know
43:51 there's this thing I listened to your
43:52 episode today and there was this thing
43:54 you said and he said it and it would be
43:57 something we would have covered for
43:58 maybe one episode I think we covered a
44:00 touchy subject it's just a potential
44:05 true/false situation we didn't say we
44:08 knew the truth of anything we just said
44:09 this is kind of funky and weird and she
44:14 we covered it for like ten minutes and
44:16 she just said you know I think this is
44:18 horrible which you guys were talking
44:20 about and I was saying well didn't you
44:22 hear how we said it we said it very
44:24 speculatively we didn't throw our belief
44:28 down on either side we're just bringing
44:29 up a topic that's going around the
44:31 internet and
44:33 and it was one of probably three events
44:38 that probably led to the ending of our
44:40 relationship but she was leveraging the
44:42 church sort of in the middle of our
44:45 conversations and saying well this would
44:47 be this would be so embarrassing if this
44:48 ever came up in my church and I'm
44:50 sitting there looking at like nobody
44:52 even knows the show exists we got almost
44:54 no followers no listens on this thing no
44:57 one listens to Kay xrz radio in LA at
44:59 your church trust me
45:01 super massive heavy-metal radio station
45:05 but in the end I went over there on a
45:08 weekend to see her and you know we had a
45:13 really good night together we laughed
45:14 really hard the night before I mean
45:16 really just good guttural fun and the
45:19 next day she was like saying goodbye to
45:22 me kind of strange and then I got some
45:25 email from her so I think it was a text
45:28 or something like that and she just said
45:30 I don't think we should see each other
45:31 anymore and I was like yeah I kind of I
45:35 kind of felt something was strange so
45:36 yeah okay I mean what am I gonna do I
45:39 did sort of you know her sister came to
45:43 me on the side and said do not let her
45:45 do that your great family loves you
45:48 she's never date anybody as balanced as
45:50 you mentally you know she's like you're
45:52 cool give her flowers go see her and
45:55 also they're kind of stuff so I did that
45:57 whole thing too you know didn't work but
46:01 then about six months later she came
46:02 back to me said I don't even know why we
46:04 broke up I was like well you'll remember
46:08 keep going to church keep dating me
46:10 you'll remember so instead of keeping
46:13 the belief system as a method of living
46:18 and and acknowledging that we're not
46:21 quite sure what anything means we know
46:22 that above all its intent is sin love
46:27 is' god' love is' purpose and so anyone
46:31 judging you when you're good and you you
46:36 you know like for me personally you know
46:38 my whole thing is i burden no one with
46:40 my existence that's my goal in life I'm
46:43 pretty damn good at it
46:45 and I will help as many people as I
46:47 possibly can in this planet you know I
46:49 am one dude and I do have my limits from
46:52 time to time but I usually get around to
46:55 everybody I mean if someone asked me
46:57 online through the facebook chat you
46:59 know hey man I'm going through a tough
47:00 one I might have to say and there's some
47:02 people listening right now that knows
47:03 this is true and they can t me and
47:04 select my life's kind of [ __ ] up this
47:05 is what it's like I'll be like okay I'm
47:08 really really busy right now give me a
47:10 few days maybe even a week tops two
47:13 weeks I'm gonna keep you in my chat and
47:15 I'll get back to you and I always do I
47:18 think I'm one for one I think
47:20 everybody's been replied to again I'm
47:22 not some Oracle or anything like that
47:24 but maybe you know a different
47:26 perspective or even refirm I'll see in
47:27 the meantime please listen to these
47:28 episodes if I feel like it's a dead-on
47:30 match between what they are saying and
47:32 what I feel and if they've already seen
47:35 the episode I say fine that's good I'll
47:36 get back to you personally but even with
47:39 that I know I'm just one dudes opinion
47:41 you know the only thing I've ever been
47:44 capable of confirming in my own
47:47 contributions back to people is careers
47:49 are the careers of my employees and
47:51 friends where I'll get an interview
47:55 going with somebody and get them a job
47:56 or and then they blow up and they do
47:59 something really amazing and they're
48:01 always good to come back and say you
48:02 know thank you very much and I've got
48:04 dudes that I've actually traced down in
48:06 this world and said look fact that one
48:08 of the funny ones was I connected with
48:10 the guy that got me into drawing video
48:13 games I found him on LinkedIn I don't
48:16 know 30 years later he bumps into me and
48:19 he's like he links to me and he's like
48:20 hey do this connect and I wrote this
48:23 like probably half a page thing I said
48:26 dude you have no idea when you gave me
48:27 that little tiny ad that changed my
48:29 entire life and I don't even think he
48:32 got to the point where he read it every
48:33 reddit he didn't feel the need to say I
48:36 mean you're welcome and he just he was a
48:38 humble guy and you know just what he
48:40 does that's great a lot of you do that
48:43 but the point I want to really get
48:45 across and again this is what I said to
48:48 the first Mormon kids that ever came to
48:50 my house Jesus eight years ago I said to
48:55 them you know I said look why is
48:56 everyone else's religion Stute soup
48:59 silly and stupid and wrong and yours is
49:01 always right flawless flawless you're
49:06 just interpreting red if you think it's
49:08 wrong hmm all right so God hates
49:11 everybody else and he thinks you're the
49:13 chosen ones but you know the weird the
49:15 hiss is like the the oxymoron for me was
49:19 Christianity is he'll talk to Christians
49:21 and then you'll say what about these
49:23 Jews Jesus was a Jew and they killed the
49:25 Jew they you know they they contributed
49:27 to him getting killed by Rome right and
49:30 and you think there's 144 tribes in the
49:33 Jewish culture that's gonna be saved but
49:35 then do you believe something completely
49:36 different than them so how are they the
49:38 chosen ones without the same belief
49:39 system that you believe they don't think
49:40 God ever walked on earth but you still
49:43 hold this out in your brain they're the
49:46 chosen ones it doesn't make any sense
49:47 and I think the whole thing is
49:49 ridiculous I think we're all either
49:53 children of God or we're the hobbled
49:57 version of the same God that's my
50:01 current belief it's my current leanin
50:04 let's put that way now I'm running out
50:07 of slots for season 4 to end and I don't
50:10 want to wait to season 5 to do this
50:12 particular episode so I'm gonna throw
50:14 this little bonus topic and it's sort of
50:16 related to this on the end of this
50:18 particular episode we can easily say and
50:25 we'll use religion as the platform to
50:28 put this out there there are radical
50:30 religions on earth right now that
50:33 believe that everyone else needs to die
50:34 look seriously heads lobbed off killed
50:38 if you don't convert to their God and if
50:41 you do convert to their God you need to
50:42 get their law system that they're crazy
50:45 [ __ ] wants it's gonna be caveman
50:48 days we're gonna go back 10,000 20,000
50:51 maybe even a hundred thousand years of
50:52 human development we should tell you
50:56 what you're dealing with and you got to
50:58 take it very serious is a very
51:00 formidable enemy that wants to get
51:02 militant and violent we think how do
51:07 these people exist in a society where
51:09 you know most of the world most of the
51:12 population
51:13 that makes the world turn doesn't
51:16 believe this kind of stuff so how does
51:18 this other thing exist we can at times
51:22 vacillate into this thought process that
51:25 that there's this this old saying the
51:29 99% virus right it's what Prince
51:32 Philip's wrote in his his memoirs or his
51:34 biography supposedly in the early 90s he
51:37 said that if he ever were to return back
51:39 to the earth as another being he
51:41 returned as the virus to kill all
51:43 mankind it's great right what kind of
51:46 [ __ ] hugs was that guy miss him when
51:49 he was a kid most of you know there's
51:52 this globalist movement to make man hate
51:56 man that's what the climate change [ __ ]
51:59 does that's what all this fuss I instead
52:01 should hate man because man is the
52:03 reason why everything's [ __ ] up how
52:05 many movies have you seen where they
52:08 lament from an alien perspective that we
52:11 don't deserve to [ __ ] live Fifth
52:13 Element did it
52:14 I don't think Luc Besson is necessarily
52:16 any club or anything but he played that
52:19 game played that card and it's happened
52:21 in so many shows where some good alien
52:24 comes down and finds out that we're all
52:26 warlike and then they're like why should
52:28 I help humanity because you guys are all
52:29 bore written just because a few scumbags
52:32 at the banker level coaxed us into Wars
52:35 coke just sin through religion sometimes
52:38 to hate each other and then we run off
52:41 like morons and kill our own kind and I
52:44 mean you realize there's countries that
52:46 have killed tens of millions of their
52:48 own people because they're stupid they
52:51 kill people with glasses because they
52:53 think laz people you know they kill
52:54 people that they perceive to be more
52:55 intelligent than themselves
52:57 so the Horde and the mob go after these
53:00 individuals a mob is a group of people
53:04 that are super undereducated
53:07 that's what a mob truly is it's
53:11 different than organized protests in my
53:14 opinion but so we see pockets of the
53:19 world that are all underdeveloped and we
53:20 see those people have to go they are not
53:23 going to make it their way behind
53:26 and of course most intellectuals will
53:28 say well that's because education is
53:30 missing from their region of the world
53:32 and that's the god-honest truth but now
53:36 here's the thing what is one of the most
53:42 undefended sectors of humanity if I said
53:48 to an American I'm gonna take away your
53:49 gun oh my god you're gonna die they're
53:52 gonna kill you if I said I'm gonna take
53:56 away your freedom of speech oh my god
53:58 they're gonna kill you they should
54:01 because those things are your god-given
54:05 rights as established by a republic you
54:08 have the right to these things because
54:10 you exist no man no woman is more
54:14 powerful than you we believe that
54:16 because we've been indoctrinated but
54:19 it's not true all right we don't defend
54:23 education at all oh we've got teachers
54:28 unions but that just defends the
54:30 pedophile [ __ ] drama teacher and gym
54:32 teacher an art teacher bed defends the
54:35 ignorant from ever having to go back to
54:38 school to learn modern technology so I
54:40 get to teach their antiquated [ __ ]
54:42 forever most prevalent in universities
54:44 you might think it's grade school and
54:46 stuff yeah
54:47 writing reading and arithmetic as the
54:50 basics but look we're now infiltrated
54:52 they've infiltrated our schools with all
54:54 these classes to screw up your kids
54:56 brain to indoctrinate them with all the
54:58 fake science religion mm-hmm you can't
55:01 teach religion in [ __ ] high school
55:03 Kenya or grade school if someone pledges
55:05 the legions now in America they're
55:06 trying to shut the whole thing down hmm
55:09 if you talk about and God We Trust well
55:12 that's got to be removed because that's
55:14 the religion that's going out the new
55:16 religion is global warming vaccinations
55:19 business destroying your physiology so
55:24 that when taught the truth you can't
55:28 process it because your brains [ __ ] up
55:30 chemically forever you got aluminum you
55:34 got mercury in your brain you got you
55:37 know mercury fillings in your teeth
55:39 you're brushing with a brain deadening
55:42 stuff called fluoride you're sweetening
55:44 your food with aspartame you're drinking
55:47 diet coke because you're a fat [ __ ]
55:49 who won't just control what you eat
55:51 right isn't interesting that people that
55:53 drink that coke are morbidly obese on
55:56 average hmm low IQs because education is
56:03 not protected in this world at least in
56:07 America it's so bad that kids are
56:10 growing up with cognitive dissidence
56:12 talk to them doublespeak talk to them
56:15 talk to them political correctness is
56:18 doublespeak it's cognitive dissidence
56:19 it's being taught to them they're being
56:21 taught to sabotage their brain they're
56:24 being taught to never be able to think
56:27 logically because to think logically is
56:29 to deny those paradigms their very
56:31 existence we don't protect our education
56:35 at all hmm oh now let's think about this
56:40 it's another thing that happens to kids
56:42 in America all the time nowadays and we
56:45 cry and we watch the news and we pass it
56:48 around and we hate the Second Amendment
56:50 because of it school shootings school
56:55 shootings are happening and we know who
56:57 does those little FF routines not sure
57:01 who dies in these things but there's
57:02 sure a lot of kids that show up to
57:04 testify that it got IMDb portfolios and
57:07 some of them and nightclubs show up from
57:09 other countries and they've got acting
57:10 careers in other countries and they seem
57:12 to disappear as they try to fudge their
57:14 English accent their American accent I
57:16 should say all right but what happens
57:20 when it really happens because it really
57:22 happens these days kids really die we
57:27 mourn because the death of a child who
57:30 wouldn't mourn the death of a child when
57:32 a child gets sick someone post a picture
57:34 on Facebook and says look can I get a
57:36 hundred thousand likes on this because
57:38 maybe we get a GoFundMe thing going so
57:40 we get him some good medicine care or
57:42 whatever because every single human
57:45 being that isn't a sociopath
57:48 you know Democrats bankers [ __ ]
57:52 monarch sell these other [ __ ] who
57:54 ruined the world they don't have any
57:56 because they're all sociopaths but the
57:57 rest of us the 99.9% of the rest of us
58:00 care we have a maternal instinct to
58:03 protect our babies and believe me
58:05 they're babies until they are wrinkled
58:07 if you're a parent your kids a baby
58:10 they're your kid you protect them so we
58:14 care about children don't we we want
58:17 them to stay alive we want them to live
58:19 a full wonderful life and especially if
58:20 you're a parent you don't wanna keep
58:22 paying the kids rent forever huh what's
58:27 gonna change that what gives your kid
58:31 the power to fish let's go into Jesus
58:37 right now he told everybody said look
58:40 man I can make you fish and bread every
58:43 day but I ain't gonna be around forever
58:45 guys got a plan I'm gonna be exiting
58:48 this place I need to teach you how to
58:51 fish and once you know how to fish you
58:54 can feed yourself forever education is
58:58 the fish lesson I can teach you a trade
59:01 skill I can teach you something so you
59:03 can make some money so you can enjoy
59:05 life so you can be enlightened to even
59:07 know that you're in a bed of roses
59:08 instead of thinking your neighbor's got
59:12 a bigger TV than you a newer car than
59:14 you they were able to upgrade their
59:17 house with marble [ __ ] kitchen
59:21 countertops right [ __ ] that really
59:23 matters right we don't protect education
59:26 at all we allow them to infiltrate our
59:30 schools with crap how many centuries are
59:36 we gonna go in this world while gravity
59:38 is still a phenomenon in the book when
59:41 the guys that discovered electricity and
59:43 invented everything that we're using to
59:44 see this show
59:45 we're long on believed in methods that
59:49 explain all this stuff and open up the
59:52 market for free energy what's
59:55 interesting is is that we can in this
59:57 example it just gave you we can think of
59:59 a hundred things that someone would die
60:01 or to protect the sovereignty of their
60:03 country to protect the health of a child
60:06 to make sure they're not shot by some
60:08 weirdo there's no question in the mind
60:12 of most people to go I will do anything
60:14 to make sure that doesn't happen to a
60:16 kid to me to my country but trying to
60:20 demonize nationalism because they'll
60:23 cite Hitler as long as that [ __ ]
60:26 guy's in the history books the way he's
60:27 in the history books completely skewed
60:29 as to his maniac [ __ ] goal in the
60:32 world like Candace Owens defend her
60:33 defended her statement in a one-hour
60:36 interview that had a little excerpt
60:37 because this douchebag Democrat in the
60:40 house took a little excerpt bout and
60:43 played it to her and said you love
60:45 Hitler because you said that nationalism
60:49 isn't bad and he was technically in the
60:52 history books falsely classified as a
60:55 nationalist the guy was a globalist if
60:57 there ever was one he wanted
60:59 blond-haired blue-eyed people like me to
61:00 be the only people on his planet
61:02 and Here I am telling you that that's
61:05 not the way I want the world to be at
61:06 all I love diversity in this planet love
61:10 it love it love it I don't ever want to
61:13 lose the ability to go to a different
61:15 country and be the outsider to taste
61:18 their food and dance in their music and
61:20 bask in their son might be careful
61:25 drinking some of the water but I can use
61:27 to that too if I need to I love
61:29 diversity I want them to be proud of
61:32 what they are and I want us to be
61:33 allowed to be proud of what we are nice
61:35 thing about America is we're a big
61:37 melting pot it's beautiful I think
61:40 education this is not an epiphany
61:44 everyone of you believe the same thing
61:46 most likely you know that education is
61:48 the only way we get out of this rat race
61:50 what has been the great awake Great
61:52 Awakening the 17 movement any time in
61:56 history where things have gotten a
61:57 little bit better or a lot better it's
62:01 education us learning about the crazies
62:03 of the world all these [ __ ] cults in
62:05 the world
62:06 these deviant [ __ ] that hurt our kids
62:09 and because we can't figure out how much
62:13 these people break the law
62:15 and hurt people and child traffic and
62:18 human traffic these people because we
62:20 couldn't get a hold of that information
62:21 because they completely controlled the
62:23 press through their Mockingbird press
62:26 before that it was the Hearst yellow
62:28 journalism and now we have people living
62:33 off of yellow journalism which is fake
62:36 news accusing folks that are bringing
62:40 them pretty much empirical proof of
62:43 things meaning this person committed
62:46 this crime this person has 500 charges
62:48 against them you know they're part of
62:50 the British Parliament remember there
62:52 was that dude that that that head guy in
62:55 Parliament that had over 550 cases that
62:58 was a 580 and that's just what we know
63:00 right that he know he got away with
63:02 hundreds more that was the only that was
63:05 where the number stopped of kids that
63:06 reported the guy when they got older go
63:09 to the British Parliament do to wipe
63:10 that clean they assigned his sister to
63:14 be in charge of the investigation and it
63:17 never went anywhere and the prime
63:19 minister at the time said I am NOT going
63:21 to tell you the truth about this guy's
63:22 crimes because it will be a disrupter to
63:25 our country so it was over half a
63:28 thousand kids out there who've now
63:31 learned that there's no justice in the
63:34 world hmm how does how do the people
63:38 just sit and watch this stuff happen
63:40 happens in America all the time
63:42 we got businessmen who do it and
63:44 preachers who do it and school teachers
63:47 and priests like non Catholic priests do
63:51 it hmm when we just say well that's
63:56 that's their religion they're whatever
63:58 they're too big to fail now that's a
64:02 cause of this of the system of no
64:04 education a bad education how many times
64:07 have I said on this show that they've
64:08 got all these kids with $100,000 degrees
64:10 and they can't get a job they're pouring
64:12 my coffee but the good kids they're not
64:15 dumb they can learn anything anything
64:19 any job out there that they could
64:20 fantasize about especially one that's
64:22 mentally bound no problem they can learn
64:25 it no problem but they have no access to
64:28 it
64:28 and there are $100,000 in debt and they
64:31 can't run away from that debt
64:32 there was a billionaire I forgot his
64:35 name it was an all-black male school
64:38 just recently happened I mentioned it
64:40 once before but you know the story of
64:42 the guy that went up in his commencement
64:43 speech and he paid for every one of the
64:47 college degrees of the kids in that
64:48 audience there's a couple kids that
64:50 dropped out of school because they
64:51 didn't have enough money to finish
64:52 school I hope he picks them up to him
64:54 and gets them through school bid he paid
64:58 for every one of their degrees now let's
64:59 just say there's some 300 kids out there
65:04 listening to him talk thirty million
65:06 bucks boom he just wiped out their debt
65:09 they get to start their life with a bad
65:11 degree or a good degree with no debt
65:13 that means that they got a bad degree
65:15 they could go back in and get in debt
65:16 again and get the good degree because
65:18 they realize the one that got didn't
65:20 work now hopefully that school just
65:21 Street teaches wonderful things I don't
65:23 anything about the school how much money
65:25 did Mueller and the Democrats waste
65:28 investigating a [ __ ] collusion
65:31 [ __ ] accusation the last number I
65:34 heard was 45 million Trump said look we
65:37 haven't even paid all the salaries and
65:39 the bills yet of that investigation and
65:41 they're trying to go for around 245
65:45 million dollars at a hundred grand a pop
65:49 it's 450 degrees how much money are we
65:53 spending on illegal immigration and
65:55 processing all these people they could
65:58 be going to forgiving debt for
66:01 overpriced education but we don't fight
66:04 back when colleges take degrees that you
66:06 know 20 years ago were fifteen to thirty
66:09 thousand dollars and now they're a
66:11 hundred to one hundred fifty thousand
66:13 dollars we don't fight that why because
66:16 they turned colleges into debt machines
66:21 and they don't care these colleges don't
66:24 care they want an extra wing on the side
66:26 of their thing they want to pay their
66:29 you know their liberal you know science
66:33 with the capital S tenured professors
66:35 two hundred and three hundred thousand
66:38 dollars a year
66:40 depending on what school again Cal State
66:44 Long Beach the chancellor's office the
66:48 secretary makes over 220,000 dollars a
66:50 year to filter phone calls and run this
66:53 guy schedule mm-hmm because they need
66:58 that kind of money for that job any one
67:01 of you hearing my voice could do that
67:04 job two hundred twenty grand California
67:08 that's a lot of money that's that's a
67:11 Bentley a Lamborghini and a house on the
67:14 beach just with one income and if that
67:17 person is married they're making half a
67:19 million dollars a year depending on
67:21 where they are but if you can gain the
67:24 system that bad the other spouse is
67:26 doing the same thing it's always the way
67:27 it is around here but you have you know
67:31 you have sporting coaches are the
67:35 highest-paid career on average in the
67:37 United States of America there's this
67:38 great map that says the highest-paid
67:40 careers in every all 50 states and I
67:43 think all but like to have sports
67:48 coaches being paid the most on the
67:50 average income now of course there's a
67:54 billionaire here and they're there you
67:55 know just dislodge that but that's not
67:57 what the statistics about it's not about
67:58 those lottery ticket winners in life
68:01 it's about normal meat potato jobs if
68:05 sports or religion how many people
68:10 religiously watch sports how many people
68:13 hate other people because of sports I
68:16 got a good friend of mine she's a genius
68:19 boy she into sports oh my god Sarris
68:23 this these championships come around
68:24 anyone playing her team there's like
68:27 devil's eyes for that person yeah she
68:30 doesn't take it to any major degree she
68:32 doesn't you know hurt anybody or
68:33 anything like that but it's a religion
68:35 and if you are not taking drugs let's
68:39 just say and we know our one friend
68:41 takes a lot of drugs but if you don't
68:43 take drugs you might not take drugs for
68:46 one reason which is to maintain control
68:48 of yourself that is your goal in life
68:52 okay so you won't control religion is
68:57 control so if you have a religion of
69:00 eating healthy that may not be too bad
69:02 you got a religion of exercising then
69:04 you gotta be careful some people spend
69:06 too much time in gyms but some people
69:07 have a whole career in that thing if
69:09 that's your career then go for it
69:11 just be aware that when you adopt a
69:13 religion its controlling you if it's a
69:16 bad religion it's gonna control you
69:18 badly and you have the choice you know
69:21 you have the choice of saying I like
69:23 alcohol I love it and I'm just it makes
69:26 my life great and Nevers a bad thing for
69:28 me I never get on line and say anything
69:30 I regret later I never do anything in
69:32 public I would regret later the cops
69:34 never arrest me I never drive drunk cuz
69:36 I'm at least the responsibility that
69:37 level and never had a DUI I never hit a
69:39 child with my car maybe it's never gonna
69:44 happen maybe it's not an if maybe it's a
69:45 win you just haven't done it yet every
69:49 single one of us is how to drink too
69:51 many and didn't realize because it's
69:53 crawling up your back right you get in
69:55 your car and driving home maybe if you
69:58 just live a few miles home from home you
70:01 get home and you're like and then it
70:03 hits you like for me if I ever drink
70:05 tequila I don't drink it anymore but
70:07 sometimes I get a drink margarita here
70:09 and there stuff takes 20 to 40 minutes
70:12 to hit me the intoxication part of it
70:15 which is why I stopped drinking a long
70:17 time ago but when you live in Los
70:20 Angeles for instance it's not uncommon
70:22 to have an hour drive home so you're out
70:25 at some party you're doing your thing
70:26 and you're intoxicated you don't know
70:28 you've lost a lot of your motor
70:31 mechanics because you're intoxicated but
70:33 you feel great because you're in the hi
70:34 you don't have the headaches it you
70:36 don't feel nauseous at all
70:37 so you hop in your car and the shit's
70:39 crawling up your back it's the effects
70:41 of the alcohol are taking effect while
70:42 you're driving home I think almost every
70:45 single adult in America at least has had
70:47 that experience one time if you drink if
70:50 you ever drink socially right you're not
70:52 drinking one time but you know it's it's
70:55 interesting to have a president that's
70:57 never had a beer that's phenomenal a
71:00 billionaire it's never had a beer or any
71:02 alcohol of any kind
71:04 phenomenal they can pot that religion
71:06 not bad right I am not convinced that we
71:11 have a religion about how to live our
71:14 lives and how to protect our children
71:16 and how to get this world on the right
71:17 track because we're so hooked on a bunch
71:20 of [ __ ] not only the traditional bad
71:23 religions which say you know cut
71:25 someone's [ __ ] head off and circumcise
71:27 women and you can kill your wife if you
71:29 want to and it takes two women in court
71:31 to equal one man's opinion but really
71:34 subtle things that consume all your time
71:38 they could be spent making you happy now
71:40 if you're totally elated with your life
71:42 you got a good job it's the same job
71:45 you've had all your whole life and you
71:47 got all that time to come home and watch
71:49 a game and stuff hey you're not the guy
71:52 I'm talking about you're not the girl
71:53 I'm talking about it's when you're
71:56 losing and you feel lost and you're like
71:59 [ __ ] I kind of got upset with my life
72:02 and so I use these barbituates I use
72:04 things to satiate myself but only you
72:09 know if you're happy or not well you
72:12 know if this stuff really works and it's
72:14 so easy to become a Stockholm Syndrome
72:16 patient of your own
72:18 if Freudians correct and I think a lot
72:22 of his opinions were his own projection
72:26 of his own issues if you want to know
72:28 about Freud just listen to Freud he's
72:30 telling you who he is but I think that
72:33 people especially due to social media oh
72:36 my god Instagram and Facebook and I
72:40 don't know about Twitter Twitter's
72:41 really everybody just goes to blather
72:43 about their differences and you know in
72:46 incubate hate I swear to god Twitter is
72:48 mostly full hate that's what that is
72:51 if you want to just brighten your life
72:54 turn off your Twitter account would you
72:56 but what's Instagram Instagram is
72:58 posting moments of your life that is
73:00 better than everyone else's life
73:02 that's why I like Instagram accounts
73:04 where people are trying to enhance the
73:06 world I don't personally do that mines
73:09 locked and I just have a few artistic
73:12 photographs I take from time to time but
73:15 I'm probably guilty of posting a photo
73:17 that made
73:18 someone else envious and that sucks it's
73:22 not necessarily their fault you know
73:25 when we sit down with our friends and
73:27 and you go how you doing man and they go
73:30 I'm not so good been lost my job can't
73:33 find a new job spend eight months I'm
73:35 running out of money my wife's gonna
73:38 divorce me here soon cuz I look like a
73:39 big [ __ ] loser and I'm not a loser
73:41 and I know I'm not and I'm getting age
73:44 discrimination because I'm over 50 or
73:45 whatever the case I got friends have
73:47 gone through all this stuff now gone
73:49 through versions of that myself what is
73:53 the thing you don't do you don't go well
73:55 let me tell great my life is about to
73:58 die man I just [ __ ] won the lottery
74:00 and debtor's I get the best job in the
74:01 world and I just my wife and I we have
74:04 sex three times a day and I love it blah
74:06 blah blah you don't do that do you if
74:08 you're you know absent of being a
74:10 sociopath you empathize and you see them
74:13 and I'm really sorry and one thing you
74:15 do almost automatically if you're in
74:16 pathetic is you don't talk about all the
74:18 wonderful things going on your life you
74:20 put that all on hold maybe that was the
74:21 first thing you wanted to talk about
74:23 because your life is going great but the
74:24 second you sit next to someone is
74:26 hurting it's not about you anymore if
74:30 anything you want to surround them with
74:32 your reality distortion field with your
74:34 your positivity and and you go well you
74:37 know I've been there I've been there and
74:40 you know the life's made of peaks and
74:42 valleys and right now you're just in a
74:44 valley and hey if you're truly on the
74:47 bottom and you may not be complete at
74:49 the bottom but here's the good news you
74:50 can only go up from there and I know it
74:51 sounds like a cliche but it's a cliche
74:53 cuz it's true and let's continue having
74:56 these conversations here's my number
74:58 here's my email you got my stuff right
74:59 we'll talk to me man and they you know
75:03 it's like they look at you like oh my
75:04 god
75:05 Thanks I needed that and that night
75:08 maybe your words only last eight hours
75:11 but that's eight hours I needed to have
75:13 a good night's sleep
75:14 they woke up the next day and that good
75:17 night's sleep was all they needed to be
75:19 positive the next day and something did
75:21 magically happen to them because when
75:23 they talk to an employer their wife
75:26 their husband their kids
75:29 they were more positive that day because
75:31 you just gave them a little bit of your
75:32 positivity that in my opinion is a good
75:36 way to live and what did we call ways of
75:39 living I think we call them religions
75:43 I'm gonna throw out a prop to everybody
75:46 who comments on the channel everybody in
75:48 the Facebook feed we have found each
75:53 other we have found each other this is
75:56 the first time on the show you got a
75:59 good place you just landed it's not me
76:01 it's the group that watches this show
76:04 and contributes because again I listen
76:07 to your comments I embed them in the
76:09 show some of these shows are all about
76:11 your suggestions I want to increase that
76:14 but a lot of times you guys give me
76:16 deeper subjects that really need a lot
76:18 of Investigation and so that's a little
76:20 tougher for me to find the time and so
76:22 I'm trying to reformat for season 5
76:25 maybe have less episodes but much more
76:27 powerful episodes we'll see
76:29 I hate odd numbers so maybe we go to 50
76:32 shows instead of 100 it's basically a
76:35 year one year which really equates to
76:39 about 10 and a half months I think about
76:42 a month and a half off and what I what I
76:45 end up doing just since we're at the end
76:47 of episode or season 4 with these last
76:49 10 episodes I've got probably 5 in the
76:52 can that need to be edited and I've got
76:55 three or four already decided
76:56 I completely dial out of the show for a
77:00 month I don't think about it I mean
77:02 again I'm going to do a lot of
77:04 improvements to them to the website
77:06 continue putting our videos on other
77:09 feeds but you know then it just starts
77:15 calling up B and I got to do it but
77:17 without you guys there'd be no reason to
77:18 make this show period and it's your
77:21 positivity and your constructive
77:22 comments and I'm seeing a lot more you
77:25 folks look at it each other's comments
77:26 and start to the comment and you know
77:29 I've been really busy lately and so I
77:30 have been able to really get in and
77:31 comment even on the Facebook side of
77:33 things I see everything just so you know
77:35 I just don't have a time to give you
77:37 intelligent responses because in my
77:39 opinion an intelligent comment whether
77:42 it be one
77:43 word when sentence or when paragraph
77:45 deserves a response and so if you make
77:49 like five responses on one video then
77:52 I'm probably gonna reply to one but you
77:55 buy time I get to the comments nowadays
77:57 you guys have already replied to each
77:58 other like sometimes you guys would
78:00 reply like ten times to somebody you
78:01 have these great conversations super
78:03 constructive and even if someone comes
78:05 in and is very counter belief or
78:08 whatever you're taking an opposite
78:09 position you know the only people that
78:12 come in a little bit rough are the
78:14 first-timers and then when they kind of
78:16 this is my assumption they tend to I
78:19 guess look around and see that
78:20 everyone's being pretty cool about their
78:22 dissent and you know if the show gets
78:25 really popular it's gonna get ugly
78:27 probably but right now it's a beautiful
78:28 heartbeat that we've got going in this
78:30 thing so I won't do anything to disturb
78:33 that in fact I want to increase the
78:35 quality of what we talk about and you
78:37 know sometimes if nothing happens in the
78:40 world it's interesting I'm kind of you
78:42 know I'm left to give you the more
78:44 philosophical and sort of existential
78:47 episodes that crawl around in my brain
78:50 from time to time but you have to
78:52 understand when I'm watching television
78:53 shows movies having conversations with
78:56 any of my friends seeing some things
78:59 written online not a lot of that that's
79:02 where I start to distill things you know
79:04 comedians they find funny things about
79:06 life and they distill you know it could
79:08 be in any situation taking a bath
79:09 standing in line getting coffee eating
79:11 food driving down the street taking a
79:13 flight somewhere and they're always
79:15 pulling out these really funny little
79:16 observations of things and that's what
79:17 comedians do well that's what I do to
79:21 create this up to rate these shows right
79:22 I think it's pretty obvious but that's
79:25 my formula so this show was kicked off
79:30 by American Gods which ain't for
79:33 everybody it's definitely not something
79:35 you watch around your kids let me make
79:37 sure that's very very clear and I don't
79:40 care if you think you let your kids
79:42 watch everything you know they're not
79:45 like 16 or above or they're like set
79:48 that LT Corbis girl with a soft Channel
79:52 she could probably watch anything and
79:54 totally get it but
79:56 you know be careful so anyway if you
79:59 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
80:01 it's been spruced up just a little bit
80:03 in terms of navigation the summer of
80:05 2019 it'll be overhauled to be a lot
80:08 more friendly to find episodes with the
80:09 search fields I can't believe I picked
80:11 the template without a search field
80:12 didn't even realize it
80:13 but there you can find several feeds for
80:16 video several feeds for audio several
80:20 places Facebook Twitter for the social
80:23 media side of things there's two ways to
80:26 contribute to the show and again I'm
80:28 about to go offline for a month and a
80:30 half so totally understand if everybody
80:32 pulls all their donations you know if
80:34 I'm not making anything and you still
80:36 donate then thank you so much
80:38 but there's PayPal for one-time
80:40 donations and there's patreon I'm also
80:46 using again I'm going to pump this a
80:47 couple times I'm a little worried that
80:49 sometimes I pump piece of software and
80:51 it'll go out of business but the brave
80:53 browser just got a brave com I can't
80:55 believe they got that domain it it's a
80:59 fantastic browser I'm using it all the
81:00 time the only thing I can't do I noticed
81:02 is sometimes I'll select I use the read
81:05 back feature while I'm doing other
81:06 things on my Mac and it's got this
81:08 beautiful selected text and hit option
81:10 escape and you pick up voice you pick
81:13 the speed you want to listen to the
81:14 voice and it beautifully reads it back
81:17 to you and brave doesn't really have
81:21 that figured out yet but I'm sure they
81:22 will and again by the summer by the end
81:27 of June end of this month I'll have the
81:31 season 1 remastered channel completely
81:34 finished and so you'll have probably 95
81:36 videos in there maybe a little bit more
81:38 I'm not quite sure how many were turned
81:40 off over time just a few I turned off
81:42 because my stuff was antiquated you know
81:46 but that's a great place if you live
81:48 outside the United States and you
81:49 haven't heard season 1 or you've never
81:51 heard season one it is by at least
81:54 episode 50 my editing is much much
81:57 better I made a few mistakes leaving in
82:00 a few things I've been taking out like
82:02 clearing my throat I know what the hell
82:04 the deal was I will eat lunch sometimes
82:07 and then come out and do a show back in
82:08 the day
82:09 and it you know you get a little phlegm
82:12 in your mouth because you're just ate
82:14 something that made me not so clear in
82:18 the voice and so there's a little bit
82:20 that in the first probably 30 or 40
82:22 videos I apologize but the audio levels
82:25 are balanced now all the proprietary
82:27 music is for the most part completely
82:29 cut out so there's not gonna be any
82:30 copyright strikes and so there's videos
82:34 out there that you've never seen for
82:35 instance the talent video has been
82:38 gagged with no audio for I don't know
82:40 three years so none of you've probably
82:42 heard that video so the meat and
82:46 potatoes of life and self-improvement
82:48 are really what's in the majority of
82:50 season one I was actually shocked when I
82:52 went back and thought I only thought I
82:54 did maybe 30 or 40 of those and now I'm
82:56 finding out it's probably more like 80
82:57 videos are mostly self-improvement stuff
83:00 so for a lot of you that come to me for
83:03 advice
83:04 definitely peruse season one and go do
83:06 it in that channel the main visual
83:08 difference you can find is that the
83:11 photograph of me holding the cigar which
83:13 is the thumbnail of season one is it's
83:16 got a cherry on the end I mean the fires
83:18 on the end of the cigar the old one
83:20 there's no cherry in the cigar so anyway
83:25 it's a lot better listen me to tell you
83:26 that right away
83:27 so anyway till the next episode take
83:30 care of yourself and someone else and
83:32 I'll see in the next deep thoughts over
83:34 now
