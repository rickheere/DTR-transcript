00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts coming to you live from
00:39 the lounge not really live but I'm alive
00:44 is that good it's been raining for like
00:47 three days straight
00:49 and so I can't go out during the day but
00:55 doing night episodes here and there but
00:59 I don't want all my episodes to be dark
01:00 in season four so lightening things up
01:03 here doesn't get as you know that much
01:05 better
01:06 surrounded by lovely man porn better
01:10 known as cigars all right as you can see
01:18 we're gonna cover the subject of what is
01:23 God's plan you know right off the bat
01:28 it's gonna rub some people wrong just
01:30 even reading the title they're gonna
01:32 click this - then here two seconds of
01:35 what I'm saying and then just tippity
01:38 type boy and you can't you can't ask
01:41 that question you don't know what's
01:42 going on and everything you see is
01:44 stupid all right
01:47 no just in case that factions out there
01:51 I just wanted laments just a little bit
01:55 about why would we do this episode well
02:00 if you're Nathan you probably will watch
02:03 this with an adjusted tone of this isn't
02:10 that important but let's see what these
02:11 kooky religious people say this doesn't
02:15 have anything to do with religion as
02:16 defined by mankind just understand that
02:19 right away we're gonna go through some
02:22 of those thought processes before we're
02:24 done because that's what man knows if
02:28 you're an atheist you know it just
02:31 depends once you accept the fact that
02:33 your friends and your family are the
02:35 most important things in the world and
02:37 you're you know personal survival is
02:39 even more important because without you
02:42 there's not them get all that other way
02:45 your brain all that's safe
02:47 the next thing up even if you're an
02:49 atheist is sort of like where the hell
02:53 did we come from
02:54 at some point you ask the question you
02:56 mean I ask it as a young person but by
03:01 40 years old you've asked yourself that
03:02 question maybe you have some good
03:05 academic background either formal
03:07 academia or your own personal research
03:09 to start giving yourself a dimensional
03:12 chance that answer any question well but
03:17 if you're religious well it's
03:20 interesting you have this paradox my
03:25 hair in my face if you go to church
03:29 every Sunday then you would probably
03:32 tell someone that God and church and
03:35 community and and congregation is the
03:38 most important thing in your life
03:40 absolutely nothing wrong with that you
03:42 live a charmed life if you can have that
03:44 opinion because what it comes down to is
03:47 pretty much us you know saying hi to
03:49 each other
03:51 communing but when you come from that
03:56 world and you you know watch a video
03:57 like this you get these feelings of
04:02 blasphemy why because all those
04:06 questions are answered right we know a
04:09 guy comes from heaven we know what he's
04:11 doing here he's punishing us you know
04:14 and he's rewarding us and whatever right
04:16 he's doing one of the two things and
04:18 he's checking his naughty list and then
04:20 when you die you go to this cloudy place
04:24 with walls with Peter at a gate and it's
04:27 check-in time I mean if you believe that
04:31 heaven has a wall and Peter's right
04:34 there at the gate then I think that you
04:37 have to do anything in your power to get
04:39 a wall built around your country a fence
04:42 around your house because that's the way
04:44 it's done by g.od up north right but
04:47 you're not supposed to talk about this
04:49 you know you're really supposed to think
04:50 about this because if you do you're
04:53 going to be accused of being unfaithful
04:56 the concept of faith is a very
04:59 interesting fallback mechanism for
05:01 a lack of any true decent explanation of
05:04 what's really going on here ah you know
05:08 I don't know you just got to have faith
05:10 and then you have someone who sort of
05:14 passively says but if you don't have
05:17 faith then you're a bad Christian then
05:21 you're like oh oh oh no I don't want to
05:23 get kicked out of the tribe because I
05:24 really like that girl over there and I
05:26 want to marry her and have all my kids
05:27 so absolutely I totally get what you're
05:31 saying thank you for clarifying right oh
05:35 my god
05:36 if any of you guys grew up in a
05:38 Christian based Church program I don't
05:40 know about other religions I'm sure this
05:43 happens in all parts of the world but
05:45 then you fall in love with a girl at
05:46 that church hopefully you're a devout
05:49 and you're being honest with yourself
05:51 but you know there's been plenty of
05:53 people who continue going to churches
05:55 you just stay close I find churches
06:00 utterly fascinating I find the
06:03 individual congregations fascinating I
06:05 find the building's that they have
06:06 constructed fascinating I find the
06:08 history of the church I'm sitting in
06:09 interesting but you know I don't think a
06:16 lot of this stuff is true I try to
06:20 repeat myself for those of you but
06:21 marathoning this whole thing recently
06:24 but here's why you ask the question what
06:28 could God's plan really be they want to
06:33 scare you away from thinking in God's
06:35 manner because they say his mind is
06:38 bigger than yours
06:39 I'm using his strictly as a lack of a
06:42 better reference and because it's more
06:45 traditional you know anything that gives
06:47 birth is usually a female in our world
06:49 and I think that this being would be
06:53 omnipotent and bisexual and all sexes
06:57 and all everything right but they try to
07:00 scare you away because they say his
07:01 brain is bigger than yours you can't
07:02 have one thought that he has of why even
07:04 try it does hurt if you really try to go
07:07 deep into it
07:08 but I think you can find some very
07:11 interesting things that I've been
07:12 mentioning all throughout all my shows
07:14 right I've got a show does God get angry
07:17 it's a very important show to me because
07:21 I think that it is ludicrous to assert
07:23 that he does and I think to anyone who
07:25 does assert that is really limiting the
07:29 creator to their own domain now I do I
07:32 think that if you were struck by some
07:34 immortal lightning bolt on your forehead
07:37 and got a little scar and you managed to
07:40 avoid bus accidents and there is no
07:43 supernova
07:43 to the Sun and even if you did float in
07:46 space eventually you land on another
07:48 planet and you continue your studies and
07:50 you study study study study and you're
07:52 smart you're really super smart and
07:54 intelligent so able to absorb facts and
07:56 put together things and be conclusive
07:58 and invent things and you live for
08:00 billions and billions and billions of
08:02 years would you get to a point sooner
08:06 than later that you could do pretty much
08:08 everything that God has done I would
08:13 think not for the mere fact that you
08:16 might be able to simulate it really well
08:18 but you've got to be bigger than the
08:20 container that you're in the characters
08:21 in the book
08:22 aren't able to come outside the book and
08:24 type into the book right so in this
08:28 interesting paradoxical relationship of
08:30 saying we want access to a mind that is
08:34 not accessible at most I mean I'm I'm
08:39 sort of throwing some assumptions out
08:41 there to set up a paradigm of which we
08:44 will destroy but the idea is I said you
08:46 know you want to go meet God in the
08:48 universe if I said that there's God
08:51 sitting on a throne somewhere than you
08:52 they can oh my god I believe in Heathrow
08:54 particles that means that God's got
08:56 gravity and he's doing this and that and
08:57 a few likes popsicles you know and you
09:00 know
09:01 juicy fruit over peppermint gum or
09:05 whatever then there's the other thought
09:08 that were in some sort of firmament type
09:10 container container and if we want to
09:12 meet God we're gonna leave this entire
09:15 mass-energy thing and we're going to go
09:19 in our pure spiritual form
09:21 when we die and so now we're in a
09:24 different realm of existence completely
09:25 that's inconceivable to us because it is
09:29 not a material quote-unquote
09:33 construction but now even with all those
09:38 bizarre existential paradigms isn't it
09:44 possible to know God I would say one of
09:48 the greatest gifts that God gives you is
09:50 you and us the other humans that are
09:55 with you because embedded in us in my
09:59 opinion says no this is no giant
10:03 epiphany for most people who've thought
10:04 about this a little bit the idea is the
10:09 emotions that we have love anger
10:12 indifference worry excitement all these
10:19 emotions that we have it is it is
10:22 literally the bloodline of every good
10:24 script of every good story of every good
10:27 moment in the history of your life and
10:31 you know just a word to the wise if
10:34 you're gonna become a writer novelist or
10:37 a screenplay writer or whatever a
10:38 copywriter what you're going for is that
10:42 minutia of emotion a good way a good
10:46 luck rule of thumb I can give you is
10:47 that if it is something that your soul
10:50 could feel without your body and it's
10:53 motivating and it's interesting even if
10:55 it's sad then you're writing good stuff
10:58 and that's really you're writing a story
11:00 if it's all mechanical body moves
11:03 through time has big gun it goes choo
11:05 choo choo and Monster has teeth that
11:07 comes out of his head and bite your face
11:08 off that's all premise that's mechanical
11:12 plot mechanisms to set up the emotion
11:16 where you're gonna have the human
11:17 condition and that is the pool by which
11:21 we start analyzing ourselves as to okay
11:25 how could you be of utter design from an
11:29 intelligent being rather hollow you know
11:34 charlton heston that person looks or as
11:37 ethereal as you could possibly imagine
11:39 that being how could you be designed by
11:43 that being with the algorithms that you
11:46 have to exist because there's going to
11:47 be a bunch of physical questions we have
11:49 about our existence and there's a bunch
11:51 of mental conditions spiritual
11:53 conditions we have as well but how can
11:56 we not exude the algorithms that work
11:59 for God be it that we are made from him
12:02 right give an example my last year in my
12:09 hometown I've said this a couple of
12:11 times I got into a wood carving Club
12:13 with my grandfather so we had wood I'm
12:19 not made of wood but the wood is made of
12:20 wood but now what do I do with the wood
12:23 I like everybody else in the room carves
12:27 it into one of many things that are in
12:30 my world one kid did this cowboy a
12:35 million times Scott he's got his guns
12:37 drawn and he's just there was a pattern
12:39 to it and he did it several times until
12:41 he got it right when you start out you
12:44 do like ducks that's my grandfather and
12:47 I were doing we make that thing
12:50 something that we understand now we
12:53 could leave it as a tree and go hey how
12:55 about this huge tree in the house honey
12:57 but she'd rather have a carved up into
12:59 smaller pieces right even though we
13:02 might be made of something and God may
13:04 not be made of something that we're made
13:06 out of right he may not need a body
13:08 there has to be something to our design
13:12 that rhymes with what his world is and I
13:16 think most of us believe that it's a
13:18 spiritual likeness and not a physical
13:20 likeness right what's interesting about
13:23 exploring a higher being is that the
13:28 archetype I've always used on this show
13:29 is the smartest human beings that I know
13:32 on a social level at least especially
13:36 you're so social level people that I
13:40 studied my dad's good friends they were
13:42 just the coolest dudes on planet Earth
13:44 one of them never got angry
13:47 ever ever ever I mean he might get angry
13:50 in his chest
13:51 I don't know but I think he always found
13:53 a way to stay cool he's the coolest
13:56 he still is he's the coolest dude on
13:58 planet Earth and so when I look at a guy
14:02 like that it's like he's not perfect you
14:05 know he's human and and he has his own
14:07 strengths and weaknesses looks like all
14:10 human beings but if he can remain calm
14:14 cool and relaxed and intelligent and
14:15 sentient right he's not like comatose or
14:17 anything and once I found out that he
14:20 wasn't angry because he has perception
14:24 of the events that occurred that would
14:25 normally make us fly off the handle he
14:27 had a much cooler interpretation and you
14:33 think about and it was basically a
14:35 better way to look at things looking at
14:38 things sideways had more information
14:40 that he looked at that we skipped over
14:42 and so at one point that fed up to my
14:48 belief in God and I said look really
14:51 angers about surprise and so God can't
14:55 be surprised right how impossible you
15:02 control every single particle in the
15:04 universe and you're gonna be surprised
15:06 at what happens well that would be
15:09 something like God created the universe
15:11 and it's much bigger than him like
15:13 humans creating deep thought the
15:15 computer and it's bigger than them and
15:16 so we can do things that that they can't
15:18 do and so they just sit back and watch
15:20 right all right I've often asked you
15:25 guys you know in a different way like
15:28 well actually I've said it I developed
15:31 this philosopher for myself like five
15:33 years ago which was essentially the
15:36 universe doesn't need another trivial
15:39 human being that's an inspiration on a
15:43 slam towards anybody
15:44 it's my motivation for being something
15:48 bigger than average bigger than my
15:51 average not your average your average
15:53 could be way above me right and when
15:56 you're in Los Angeles California what's
15:58 interesting is you see people that are
16:00 succeeding at
16:01 that is just breathtaking and yes
16:05 there's the shyster who's living way
16:07 outside of his means you know that's
16:09 what I call Orange County disease Orange
16:11 County California I smoked at other
16:15 lounges too and one of them says he's a
16:18 twenty thousand heir
16:20 they usually define us someone who's
16:22 like you know hundreds of thousands of
16:24 dollars in Ted yes he's driving his
16:25 Lamborghini it's all on the edge of
16:28 repossession and foreclosure their
16:30 houses and stuff but for the moment
16:31 they're living in the special sauce as
16:35 they have defined it material objects
16:37 but there are people that I know that
16:39 have tons of money that are very
16:43 god-fearing people in some cases in some
16:45 cases fairly atheist but they live on
16:49 top of the world and it's if they take
16:51 massive risks and they focus focus focus
16:53 and they apply themselves on a just
16:57 constant basis every year they're
16:59 producing one or two massive products
17:01 some of my people I know that have two
17:03 television shows and a music career you
17:08 think in Jesus how do you get time to
17:10 record a whole new album and run two
17:13 different shows plus all this other
17:15 entrepreneurial stuff you know and so
17:18 you have no excuse I have no excuse to
17:20 look at them and go oh and they're
17:22 physically monsters and physically fit
17:25 right and so you're like geez you know
17:27 goes to the gym touches does that
17:30 constant pounding now as dr. Tyrell said
17:35 the Canada burns twice as bright burns
17:37 half as long and you've burned so very
17:40 bright haven't you Roy we are all
17:42 looking for motivation in life as just
17:46 as soon as mommy and daddy stopped
17:49 giving you everything that you want you
17:52 have to get motivated like I just said
17:54 in a recent episode I started working as
17:56 a kid because I wanted to buy my own
17:57 clothing all my own stuff my own music
18:01 everything no one could tell me no and
18:04 it wasn't because I thought my parents
18:05 were [ __ ] or anything I knew that
18:07 they were working their butts off and
18:08 they couldn't you know listen I just
18:10 knew the world wasn't about giving me
18:12 money giving me stuff and
18:14 was like the the challenge was go do it
18:16 yourself you know what I have my physics
18:19 teacher
18:22 Keith Goering my god this guy he's still
18:25 alive amazing human being he he taught
18:31 me and this is gonna get back into the
18:33 this is laying the foundation of sort of
18:36 what the universe / God might have in
18:39 store for us right but when my teacher
18:42 was 13 years old he wanted to telescope
18:45 can't afford it so you got a piece of
18:47 glass from some glass place all rough
18:49 cut the top out of a tree stump sunk it
18:54 in there was sand in a towel create
18:59 sandpaper and sand it on one side of it
19:02 flipped it over to the other side of it
19:04 and put it inside of a tube I made his
19:07 own reflector
19:07 excuse me meters own wins telescope at
19:10 the high school he built his own star
19:12 projector he drilled 2,100 holes and
19:16 this at least 1200 1200 holes I think
19:18 and all different drill bit sizes so we
19:21 have all the perfect light for each one
19:24 of the stars the lumens for each one of
19:26 those stars when he lowered the light on
19:28 this thing he build his own geodesic
19:30 dome he's lowered the light on this
19:32 projector and I'm telling you I was in a
19:34 world class observation observatory
19:40 excuse me looking at the Stars he even
19:42 did the little tiny globes off to the
19:44 side so you could project the
19:45 constellations in a separate thing the
19:48 dude was ingenious right he wanted to he
19:50 wanted a keyboard so he built one I
19:52 wanted a keyboard so Graham won you know
19:55 it's how I learned how to read music as
19:56 a kid so this whole thing of you know
19:59 you're in the Midwest you you don't have
20:01 stuff but nobody cares you just you're a
20:03 maker you go and do it you make it get
20:06 your hands dirty and believe me your
20:08 satisfactions in the day is insane we're
20:12 in this horrible situation now that the
20:15 deep state has so [ __ ] up this world
20:18 and so destroyed the minds of children
20:19 both chemically pharmaceutically their
20:23 food supply sucks their education sucks
20:26 their arts of
20:28 d funded right parents are so overworked
20:31 they can't do anything and so now we're
20:33 two generations of now three generations
20:35 past any parent that was creative you
20:39 know I think that parents I don't know I
20:40 mean I can assume is when the kids say
20:43 mom I'm bored it's like here's my credit
20:45 card
20:46 go rack up some [ __ ] on the phone you
20:48 know okay
20:50 instead of like we'll go do something
20:53 you little lazy bastard I bought you a
20:55 bunch of toys bunch of some Legos I've
20:58 already built a Millenium Falcon
20:59 we'll build something else same parts go
21:02 for it right look all the houses on the
21:05 street they're all built out of the same
21:06 brick it's the same brick man you know
21:09 maybe a few different colors and then
21:12 you kind of go back to your room and you
21:13 know you're like oh god I gotta create
21:14 something right where's the analogy with
21:17 God there okay where's God where is God
21:24 I'm here by myself doing an episode
21:27 about the dude why doesn't he show up
21:28 say right here I assume he can get get a
21:32 day off from work but he's not here is
21:35 he
21:35 I mean we think we're living in the
21:40 bowels or the palace the in the bosom of
21:43 God we we live in his stuff right God
21:48 leaves us alone doesn't he
21:51 because what if God showed up we would
21:55 live in the shitty Cortes socialistic
21:58 world wouldn't we
22:00 where's just you hungry or here's a food
22:03 pellet you know you're you're not
22:05 entertained here's some indoctrination
22:07 and some propaganda if any of you saw
22:10 the black mirror I believe it's the
22:11 second episode first season where
22:14 they're all peddling bikes that's what
22:17 that world will end up being you will
22:19 pedal for credits you have to spend your
22:21 credits did not watch advertising on all
22:24 five of your walls five of your six
22:26 walls you'll become some weird oddity of
22:30 the state whoever is that the tippy-top
22:32 gets to buy you just to give you a
22:35 reality show and do some little naughty
22:38 things to you on camera because that's
22:40 what other people want to see
22:42 remember thx 138 beatings at night of
22:46 other people in this world was the
22:48 entertainment and they watched not
22:50 empathetically they didn't cry fact
22:53 someone had sex at the same time they
22:55 watched these beatings a little bit of
22:58 the ultraviolence let's be lucky we are
23:03 not there right now we've probably been
23:05 there several times in the past right so
23:10 we can establish the fact that God
23:14 doesn't intervene much but now here's
23:20 the thing and all my episodes about
23:23 existentialism and mind over matter and
23:28 manifest destiny kind of themes I for
23:34 many years now have thought that the
23:36 most brilliant thing our creator ever
23:38 did was leave us with everything that's
23:41 important all the capabilities all the
23:44 tools that are important most namely
23:47 being that we can control the universe I
23:50 mean we don't have to run the world the
23:55 way we're running it in 1946 after World
24:00 War Two was over this planet took a huge
24:03 poop and relaxed and you know was really
24:07 cool with each other the music was off
24:10 the chain right the movies were off the
24:13 chain in fact we may it's a pretty damn
24:14 good movies during World War two Snow
24:17 White dropped in the depression right
24:20 so did Casablanca but slowly as the
24:27 generations were trusting human beings
24:29 these very evil people started taking
24:33 over the United States of America for
24:35 the bankers corrupted us but the first
24:39 generation that experienced it
24:41 my parents the baby boomers they
24:43 believed it and why wouldn't they
24:44 they're good people you believe you know
24:46 you trust before you distrust right
24:48 there you don't have to earn trust with
24:50 their generation it's the other way
24:51 around now us mutts
24:54 40 and below were more cautious because
25:01 we didn't grow up in their world we did
25:03 anything spoon-fed to us right how do we
25:06 worship God today we pick a Sunday or
25:10 Saturday usually and then we sit and
25:14 worship for a couple hours and then we
25:18 go home we feel really good that we've
25:19 got really close with God and then we go
25:23 about go about our day and some of us
25:25 carry that conversation with God moving
25:28 forward some of us don't and I don't
25:32 think that God really cares either way
25:33 as long as you do one thing and that is
25:37 be kind and generous to other people
25:39 follow common law and become something
25:43 special that does not mean you are
25:47 famous it doesn't mean you have an album
25:49 or a movie or television show if you're
25:53 a great parent and your kid gets it
25:56 again
25:57 kids are now programmed away from you so
25:59 if I say one of those statements and
26:01 you're like oh my god my kid thinks I'm
26:02 a jerk
26:04 please don't take responsibility for all
26:08 of that in some cases some parents are
26:11 horrible parents and some parents are
26:13 just neglecting parents because they're
26:14 confused or they're overworked it's a
26:16 lot of conditions now that exists that
26:18 will rip you away from your kid but
26:20 they're always telling your kid money is
26:23 love money is love every Christmas every
26:25 birthday every goddamn holiday that's a
26:27 toy kind of holiday if your parents
26:30 don't give you money that's they're
26:33 either a failure at life because they
26:35 don't have a lot of money or they don't
26:38 love you right I can tell you having
26:41 been fairly privileged to give my kids
26:44 some some neat little you know computers
26:46 and that stuff she could work on skill
26:48 sets it didn't affect her opinion of me
26:51 at no point does she wake up today and
26:54 go I love my dad why do you love your
26:55 dad well because gave me lots of
26:58 computers and you know art supplies and
27:01 all this other stuff no if I taught her
27:03 how to do something that she likes then
27:05 maybe that but if I said look
27:08 if she can just go least the dude never
27:09 lied to me as much as I didn't like
27:11 hearing about chemtrails and other [ __ ]
27:13 that my friends didn't know what the
27:15 hell he was talking about he never lied
27:17 to me and there's like a little
27:20 attribute that may be valuable to her
27:22 and you have those same things right but
27:25 now what do we have in terms of just the
27:27 physical presence that we have right
27:30 well it seems kind of silly to talk
27:32 about it as a scientist you might say
27:37 well we are made from the earth period
27:41 because the earth is made of you know
27:42 earth has in its crust all these
27:45 different minerals all these different
27:48 chemical elements that have all come
27:50 together under different circumstances
27:51 you know crushing plates and heat and
27:54 you know big explosions supposedly in
27:56 the in the depths of the universe that
28:00 crushed together huge atomic you know
28:04 compounds but we do have this ecosystem
28:08 of which we're built from it's very
28:10 interesting pretty much everything in
28:14 this planet needs water it's a very
28:17 interesting common thing blue algae
28:19 which is rumored to be you know one of
28:21 the first multi-celled things on the
28:25 coastline it has to drink insects that
28:30 can hibernate for a long time they have
28:33 moisture trapped in animals that
28:36 hibernate for a long time
28:37 well they amassed all that during the
28:39 summertime and they go sleep perhaps in
28:41 a cave and they got it all in their
28:43 system slow down their heart all that
28:45 stuff so you know as a scientist you
28:51 know that maybe atheist you you just
28:53 have to think well geez we always assume
28:56 that aliens look way different than us
28:57 but like I suggested in the evolution
29:01 episode number two I think that after
29:04 studying the way that mass comes
29:05 together and the way it rests due to
29:08 gravity on a surface you're going to get
29:10 the penetrations which create limbs
29:12 you're going to get the pods of the
29:14 bodies and I think it's a very natural
29:16 evolution as to how we're put together
29:19 on this planet I think there's
29:21 a few things that have more than two
29:23 eyes spiders is like one of the first
29:26 things and then you've got a couple
29:27 derivatives thereof but most things
29:30 survive I'll have two eyes isn't that
29:32 fascinating right and isn't it
29:34 interesting that even though some
29:35 animals and insects can swivel their
29:37 heads backwards and you know you know
29:39 lizards chameleons lizards with their
29:43 buggy eyes they can damn there look
29:47 behind him and alka turn his head around
29:49 but no animal that I know of has an
29:53 eyeball at the back of their head if
29:56 you're an evolutionist you might want to
29:59 explain that because I think the case
30:02 for an eyeball on the back of your head
30:04 it's pretty good you know no humans we
30:08 have hair so we'd have to work out some
30:10 bald spot there but we never did it even
30:13 though I'm sure that out of all the
30:15 indigenous deaths that have happened to
30:17 NAT in nature a shit-ton um happen from
30:21 behind don't they you see a cheetah
30:23 chased that elk a man yeah a
30:26 little-little out the back of his old
30:28 back door he'd see that dude coming like
30:33 he's on me ho holy [ __ ] changed the path
30:36 right ok but just imagine my kids a
30:44 chemist I think that's awesome
30:48 she looks at a periodic table constantly
30:51 ok those elements of a periodic table
30:55 were in my opinion oh they're ether will
30:58 designate ether all designations of
31:00 atomic mass in my opinion she is not of
31:04 that opinion yet may never be that's
31:07 just fine I love her to death but god
31:10 this being would have had to have chosen
31:15 those elements to create other things
31:18 out of right because it's pretty hard to
31:21 just Bowl a bunch of random particles
31:24 into the universe and then voila boom
31:27 you get the universe and I'll say this
31:30 at nauseam I apologize but Stephen
31:32 Wolfram is the mathematician that
31:34 created math
31:35 the application where you can do
31:37 anything mathematical and render it into
31:40 3d models and the guy is probably one of
31:44 the most unsung geniuses this planet has
31:48 ever produced in the last hundred years
31:51 but he wrote a whole book it's called a
31:55 new kind of science I had to read this
31:59 for research on a movie I've said this
32:03 to a couple times but it's it's about I
32:06 don't know four or five inches thick I
32:09 think it's a couple thousand pages one
32:11 of the gist's that you get out of the
32:13 book is that when you want to start the
32:17 universe with something right he was
32:19 trying to figure out how many particles
32:20 in the universe are unique we haven't
32:23 been able to parse individual ether all
32:26 particles let's just say but he deduced
32:29 that whatever the fundamental particle
32:31 is it is creating couple higher state
32:34 particles could be different particles
32:36 of the same sort of size but what he
32:39 figured out was you have to have between
32:43 three and four unique particles in a
32:45 universe to create utter randomness okay
32:48 now we do the patterns here and there
32:50 but they're not patterns in the way that
32:52 computers make patterns so in his
32:55 simulation software he made a life
32:59 algorithm with two different objects one
33:02 and two a binary system singularity
33:06 binary system immediately patterned out
33:08 of course then he did three and four and
33:12 he was able to achieve full randomness
33:14 forever and it's a pattern that crawls
33:17 across the screen okay with rules of
33:19 randomness to allocate these particles
33:23 with five and above he got a lot of
33:27 randomness for quite a while and then a
33:29 miracle happened and it turned into a
33:31 pattern like a really hardcore pattern
33:34 that was not going to be suitable for
33:35 life so he is mathematically deduced we
33:40 believe the the fundamental universe is
33:43 built out of three to four different
33:46 unique particles
33:48 like it has to be could be three could
33:52 be four could be both I guess they can't
33:56 be both but one would could you know
33:58 they could be like one of them is a
33:59 wiggler you know it doesn't have to
34:01 participate and it still still ran it
34:04 because it's a three right why mention
34:06 that it gets to just the basics of God
34:11 creating the physical universe right now
34:13 is it important that we know I created
34:15 the physical universe I don't know maybe
34:18 but if nothing else if any of you've had
34:22 a father an uncle or a mother or an aunt
34:24 and you stared over their shoulder while
34:27 they did something they sewed something
34:29 they cooked they crafted something they
34:31 knitted you know like I said in the
34:33 previous episode some guy fixing an
34:34 engine if you don't have that pattern in
34:38 your body as a fully understood pattern
34:40 it's totally interesting right sometimes
34:44 we continue watching a pattern because
34:46 someone makes something difficult look
34:48 really easy right I've seen guys play
34:51 drums forever right my buddy Bobby blots
34:55 our plays the dude is a magician the
34:59 level of funk this guy pulls out there's
35:01 a bunch of them Jimi out on those guys
35:03 oh my god they're just you know Jimi is
35:07 like a ballerina man he just plays it's
35:10 like it's like you know John Bonham or
35:13 Brian Tichy are those guys I've seen
35:15 them all play and not John Bonham but
35:18 it's just interesting to see this kind
35:20 of stuff because it shows a level of
35:22 skill and understanding that it's
35:23 intimate right how many times have you
35:27 seen movies where someone's a magician
35:29 and thus they let the writer gets the
35:32 scene all the way down to everyone's
35:34 gonna die and someone like Gandalf walks
35:36 in he goes you know and I really am
35:38 tired I'm just physically tired today
35:40 and get a lot of sleep last night I
35:41 walked all night through this
35:43 middle-earth joint all right I need to
35:46 save us all okay whew and he just makes
35:49 it easy and he saves everyone's life
35:51 those are fun little scenes when they
35:54 happen almost every single one of you
35:57 I'm going to say every single one of you
35:59 but I want to leave a little thing out
36:01 there in case I got a
36:02 one-year-old watching you have something
36:05 that is amazing that you do that you
36:08 know you may not even know it
36:09 you're just boof you do this one thing
36:11 and everyone else watching news like oh
36:13 I should do that it's really simple then
36:15 they tried it's all bring won't burn
36:17 it's a big crash and burn right one
36:20 thing I tell my students I think it's
36:23 important to say it here I've said it
36:24 before an episode of million years ago
36:27 is depending on the class and my time I
36:31 always tell them I say look I say before
36:36 I get started let me remind you that all
36:39 of you are incredibly amazing and then I
36:45 say look I know that every teacher might
36:47 come in and tell you that to make you
36:48 feel good trying to win you over I'm not
36:51 trying to do that you are the latest
36:54 incarnation of your family's DNA your
36:59 DNA has survived every trial and
37:01 tribulation throughout history whether
37:03 we be created by evolution and some
37:06 randomness or by God or both you have
37:11 something about you that makes people
37:13 attracted to you because someone
37:14 procreated with somebody to make you
37:17 you're either beautiful you're handsome
37:19 you're intelligent you're creative or
37:22 you're all above or a bunch of other
37:24 stuff that is important to to the rest
37:28 of us right so literally when you look
37:33 in the mirror every day you have to see
37:37 this in yourself you have to it doesn't
37:40 matter what any goddamn magazine or some
37:42 other person's opinion of you is it
37:44 doesn't matter now you could go take it
37:47 too many vaccinations eat too much
37:49 crappy food and you you're kind of a
37:50 little bonk wonky in the brain until you
37:52 detoxify yourself that doesn't matter
37:57 you are still this archetype of
38:01 excellence so remember that as you parse
38:04 the universe you're a cherished creation
38:06 you really really are now some people
38:10 turn into George Soros's yeah but evil
38:13 plays games with all things right
38:16 so why did God create us why is that was
38:22 God lonely is there really more than one
38:25 of us right I hate to harp on that but
38:30 I've got a bunch of friends of mine that
38:32 did struggle with a belief in God at all
38:36 and I was driving a car a couple weeks
38:40 ago with two people in the car that
38:42 really struggled with God the whole idea
38:44 that there is one and I said well you
38:48 know if you guys ever thought about you
38:49 know there's only one soul and there's
38:51 no time for that soul to touch us right
38:54 I mean there's not I can't be here
38:56 because you're there and now there's
38:57 none of that
38:58 limitations whatsoever and I was shocked
39:02 that both of them went because both of
39:06 them were like I love that idea and I
39:07 said yeah because when I hurt you
39:09 I feel bad and that's because you're me
39:13 right and vice versa and I know that we
39:17 think that there's people out there that
39:18 don't care I would say that there's
39:21 definitely states of mind that can get
39:23 someone into a I'm glad I killed
39:26 somebody sort of phase right because
39:29 they built up a narrative in their mind
39:30 that either is like an Iago out of
39:34 Othello it's just the evil bastard but
39:37 according to Yago he's a good guy or
39:40 there's military industrial complexes
39:42 which craft stories to keep us all at
39:45 war with each other it's my last episode
39:47 actually I think I just I just gave away
39:51 my next episode it's coming it's another
39:53 night episode so I want to do night day
39:56 night
39:56 this isn't day it's actually like 12
39:58 o'clock at night right now but can we
40:01 understand God I mean can we figure out
40:03 why we're here we have to assume that
40:07 that algorithm thing we've been talking
40:09 about with ether as it is above so2 is a
40:11 below what that really means is there's
40:13 one set of physics physics that makes
40:19 water make a bubble is the same physics
40:22 that makes gravity make an earth it's
40:25 just you can wave your hand inside water
40:26 pull it out and go well I'm wet look I
40:28 got raising hands
40:29 now perhaps if you were as big as God
40:32 and you waves it around ether maybe you
40:34 get a little wrinkly fingers too you
40:36 don't have to if I said where is the
40:39 water around the bubble tell me well
40:41 it's right there no no I want to know
40:43 where each individual pixel or you know
40:45 like a little molecule of waters and
40:46 you're like woof I don't know it's like
40:48 going everywhere and I say that's what
40:50 ether is all ether can't exist that's a
40:52 bunch of [ __ ] just random [ __ ] fly
40:54 in the air yeah just like your water in
40:57 your pool water and your glass when
40:59 you're watching all the bubbles come up
41:00 through the carbonation same thing pal
41:04 you see how that correlates between the
41:06 two okay we know the Fibonacci pattern
41:10 go look at the the reversing rivers and
41:15 what does it forget that place in Canada
41:18 once a year the river goes backwards
41:20 goes up the hill
41:22 lots of currents in that water just look
41:25 up Canada reversing River and you'll
41:27 find it right
41:28 I dare not cut a clip into my film
41:31 otherwise some mf'er will copyright
41:35 strike me it's really shitty with this
41:38 whole copyright strike thing you can't
41:40 share anything because you know somebody
41:43 wants to get paid and it's like okay
41:45 dudes I don't know how many people are
41:47 sucking down the David Copperfield's
41:51 flying footage and Hitchhiker's Guide to
41:52 the galaxy TV show series from 1980 you
41:57 know it's on Amazon Prime but I bet it
41:58 doesn't get that many hits and if I give
42:01 you a reason to watch it and you'll
42:02 maybe you'll purchase the product right
42:06 but I believe that not only is it
42:09 mathematical algorithms that show us how
42:11 things work in this universe it's
42:13 spiritual algorithms that make us love
42:16 each other right I got my closing line I
42:22 believe I'm just paraphrasing I don't
42:25 think I'm doing a word-for-word but it's
42:26 from George Carlin I well maybe did say
42:31 used to end his concerts and he'd say
42:32 take care of yourself and somebody else
42:34 and I love George but George was a
42:37 full-blown atheist because the Catholic
42:40 Church had so destroyed him as a child
42:41 that he set out his whole
42:43 life to hate them and undo them right
42:47 very sad he lost the ability to be
42:51 deeply spiritual in a scientific way
42:53 maybe I mean he never talked about
42:55 anything other than that he's super
42:56 [ __ ] brilliant guy amazing but that
43:00 makes death kind of shitty right when
43:02 you if you go into a denial state up
43:07 until death then you tend to do a bunch
43:11 of kooky [ __ ] right before you die don't
43:13 you be the whole atheist your whole life
43:16 and at the end you know even Steve Jobs
43:18 did this right he was able to say at the
43:21 end of his life why think I think I do
43:22 believe in a God again I think his last
43:25 words were like oh my oh my oh my and he
43:29 was not in any pain it didn't seem he
43:32 was seeing something wonderful
43:34 whatever that was right I think it'd be
43:36 kind of funny you know maybe in 40 years
43:39 or so 40 50 years some of us start
43:43 kicking off who watch this show shows
43:46 long gone and we get to our deathbed and
43:50 we're just chill or relax we've had all
43:52 these conversations about God and even
43:55 though we don't know exactly where we're
43:56 right and exactly where we're wrong
43:58 either way it's pretty decent pretty
44:03 decent ending and hey if it's black and
44:05 there's nothing who gives a [ __ ] right
44:07 but if we just step through that little
44:09 membrane of the firmament dome wherever
44:12 it exists a metaphoric will want a
44:13 spiritual one but get on their side and
44:16 okay man what's up hey any cigars this
44:21 is heaven right here right you know it's
44:23 like yes I do my son for those of you
44:27 coming exclusive exclusively through
44:28 podcast I'm at my favorite cigar lounge
44:32 sitting inside the humidor
44:35 but now for those of you who've had
44:38 children and I don't mean to bring up
44:43 any sore spots for any of you one of the
44:44 kids that you didn't have any there's
44:46 plenty of room for you to experience out
44:48 with other people's kids and just you
44:50 know volunteering things
44:54 but I think one of the greatest things
44:57 that ever happened to mankind was the
45:00 ability to procreate because if you
45:03 really think about it we're talking
45:04 about understanding God how do you ever
45:08 understand anything right one of my
45:12 favorite movies that Prince ever did in
45:14 fact it's my favorite movie he ever did
45:15 was under the cherry moon it's a black
45:18 and white french film why wouldn't i
45:20 love it but there's a funny scene I
45:22 mentioned this one time in the entire
45:24 time I've made this show so I'll mention
45:26 it again
45:27 France is playing this dude who plays
45:30 the piano and south of France in the
45:34 Riviera I believe he's got his buddy
45:36 Jerome from the time used to both
45:39 gigolos and so they take care of all
45:41 these ladies or princess obviously
45:42 playing a piano being awesome and they
45:45 finally meet this the whole movies about
45:46 the fact that this girl is going to at
45:50 the age of 21 she's gonna inherit a
45:52 gigantic trust and a bunch of money and
45:54 they're going to scam her get get him to
45:58 fo get her to fall in love with Prince
46:00 and then he'll get married and then
46:01 he'll divorce her and take take the
46:03 money some sort of settlement but as the
46:07 old classic archetype goes with that
46:09 story he falls in love with her and so
46:12 does Jerome but on one of the outings
46:16 they take she takes them to I think lab
46:18 Evian that's what she called it and he's
46:22 got a tuxedo on it's when he first cut
46:23 his hair and they're sitting this French
46:26 restaurant and she is essentially
46:30 playing this aristocratic kid she's
46:33 definitely middle upper class at a
46:36 minimum and she lives in this [ __ ]
46:39 mansion her dad's this big oil mogul
46:41 who's an amazing actor who was in them
46:43 he was the bad guy in Beverly Hills Cop
46:46 and he was in Clockwork Orange as a cop
46:49 who punched Alex in the face but she's
46:52 kind of being uppity and doing the
46:54 peasant thing and prince is looking at
46:58 and they're technically in the storyline
46:59 they're from Florida and he was making a
47:06 distinction about knowledge versus was
47:08 which is what we call on this show
47:12 smart versus intelligent right but he
47:16 says there he goes what have you what do
47:17 you know from knowledge she's looking at
47:20 him and she's like twenty twenty years
47:22 old in this film she's played
47:23 beautifully by this actress that alive
47:24 you don't know but he said he goes you
47:27 know Garcon abu crayon you know and he
47:29 writes down on this napkin the phrase
47:34 Rekha stow and he holds it up and he
47:38 goes tell me tell me how you know
47:41 intelligence you are and he shows what's
47:44 this she says nothing in you know and he
47:47 says no it is something say it out loud
47:49 so we can hear you she was oh you're
47:51 acting like a child and she says say it
47:53 and she goes reqest oh and everybody you
47:58 know he and rome laugh and they get her
48:00 to say it and he says he says what is it
48:03 it's nothing you know because it is
48:06 something now say it louder
48:07 bla bla bla she probably starts
48:08 screaming it in the restaurant and she
48:11 goes and there's both just laughing and
48:13 they and then she looks at him and she
48:14 goes what is it and he goes well if you
48:18 wanted to buy a Sam Cooke album where
48:20 would you go and there's this huge pause
48:22 huge beat and then she goes the record
48:25 store and they just blow up laughing
48:27 again but it shows you the difference
48:29 between thinking you know something and
48:32 knowing it and knowing it is the
48:33 experience okay so why do we exist well
48:39 I'm gonna assume that you're gonna go
48:41 with me on the idea that we're a
48:42 symbiotic soul body being I think we
48:47 have plenty of proof of that you know
48:49 famous people living in their Muse mo
48:50 parks for one right there are so
48:53 different okay what does a constraint
48:58 give you how many of you have seen a
49:01 pool of water
49:02 I don't even seen a bowl of water and
49:05 you've seen a bowl of water your whole
49:07 life you know for various reasons clean
49:09 off your hands I don't know put the baby
49:13 in after it's born whatever
49:16 and then you see an ice sculpture some
49:19 dudes chainsaw on the thing down picking
49:21 it out looks like a big surfer or
49:22 whatever Silver Surfer the ice is a
49:27 constraint of water which gives it a
49:29 dimension which gives it identity but
49:32 water by itself is just water
49:35 well if water was an intelligent life
49:37 force or had intelligent life force
49:39 attached to it what did it learn by
49:42 becoming ice it learned what being
49:45 frozen was like not being able to move
49:47 being forced to stay in a position and
49:50 then learning how to melt again learning
49:52 that it was a lifecycle it was not
49:54 frozen then it was frozen and it was not
49:56 frozen and he can go on that loop
49:58 forever right if we're willing to
50:00 recognize ice as a living being in water
50:03 as this sort of ether all dust to dust
50:06 stage then we would say water becomes
50:09 alive when it becomes ice we might form
50:13 from the earth earth's resources our
50:16 mothers are nourished our fathers are
50:18 nourished they copulate boom there's
50:21 that little heartbeat the soldier ops
50:24 off maybe it's the one maybe there's a
50:26 bunch maybe there's infinite who knows
50:28 then we become human there's a lot of
50:32 evidence that we are fairly telepathic
50:35 when we're born and so we end up
50:40 shedding our telepathic abilities and
50:43 perhaps our previous life memories
50:45 because that's the kind of training
50:47 wheels we need you know you're
50:48 disoriented you're like oh my god I was
50:51 just in Monaco yesterday I was a
50:53 billionaire
50:54 on my boat and I had that damn heart
50:56 attack with that chick in the basement
50:59 of my ship now I'm a kid and Idaho
51:05 trying to figure out where I'm gonna you
51:08 know what am I gonna be Mormon now like
51:10 okay maybe you're happy about that maybe
51:12 you're not maybe that's why you're
51:13 crying in the night you're like man I
51:15 love talking I love walking around doing
51:18 my own thing but I can't so your cry you
51:20 cry you cry and after a while you start
51:24 forgetting who you were and you start
51:26 becoming who you are
51:28 slowly when you're alive you start
51:31 learning things because you're
51:31 constrained in this body for any of you
51:34 have considered the sociology of being
51:36 alive you're born into a particular you
51:39 know decade of a particular century of a
51:41 particular millennia you're born into a
51:44 geographical location which has a
51:46 varying level of sophistication not to
51:50 be misunderstood as a different level of
51:55 happiness right I always like to go to
52:01 you know the tribes in Africa the ones
52:06 that are still using body paint the ones
52:08 that select their mates by Jhumpa can
52:10 jump the highest who's available I love
52:14 those examples because you see smiles on
52:16 these people's faces that we don't have
52:18 in the big city I mean if you had a
52:21 scratch off and you won five grand you
52:22 might have a smile almost as much as the
52:24 kid who has a smile all day long in
52:26 Africa and they're still hunting Lions
52:30 with Spears man I mean I would call them
52:35 bigger badasses than any of the bros
52:36 hanging out at the local bars in my area
52:38 so it doesn't matter where you are you
52:42 get to have an experience relative to
52:44 that area now some people really journey
52:47 away from where they're born right the I
52:50 think one of the most fascinating
52:50 archetypes is are the indigenous
52:53 Africans that end up in Europe and
52:56 they're like supermodels what a
52:58 difference I mean I know not all of
53:00 Africa's tribe was more of it
53:02 sophisticated than tribal but what a big
53:05 difference from being maybe poor at
53:09 least monetarily speaking and getting to
53:12 have pretty much anything you can shake
53:14 a stick that right when you have a child
53:18 to get back on my point you go through
53:21 so many experiences think about the
53:23 courtship of the person that you ended
53:25 up meeting with to create the child now
53:29 sometimes we have kids and it was maybe
53:33 not as intentional as other times and
53:35 other times you planned it ten years
53:37 before you had the chance to have the
53:38 child and you met the right person and
53:41 even though maybe you're not able
53:42 stay within the rest of your life you're
53:43 like that's the one she's the one or
53:45 he's the one that's gonna help me have a
53:47 kid the new kid goes through their life
53:50 and you you've already had your life up
53:53 to that point so you have all these
53:54 proprietary experiences that relate to
53:56 all those elements of sociology and then
53:59 you get to take you know like I was born
54:01 in Germany lived there for a little
54:05 while moved to Kansas where my parents
54:06 were from so I got this an awesome
54:08 experience there I moved to
54:10 Massachusetts for little while came back
54:11 Kansas moved in California I'm from the
54:14 southern and northern that's where my
54:15 kid was born so now my kids being born
54:19 in California then we all packed up and
54:22 moved back south but I watched my kid
54:25 grow up in a world that I don't know I
54:27 don't know what I would have thought
54:28 about that she's never been truly
54:31 landlocked cuz she's always been close
54:33 to the coast she's always had amusement
54:36 parks like Disneyland or something close
54:38 by there's always something else to do
54:40 in these coastal regions right beautiful
54:43 weather all the time she never had to
54:45 deal with black ice highways and having
54:48 to shovel your car out and before you're
54:49 late for work or school all right
54:53 not a bad thing it's a different thing
54:54 right but there's all those little
54:57 meticulous moments when you're a parent
55:00 when you're trying to give your kid the
55:01 very best they don't understand what
55:03 you're doing but you're trying to try to
55:05 explain it to them as best you can you
55:08 were seeing the cycle of life not only
55:10 as an individual but with your child as
55:12 well why is that I saw this exist I
55:18 think it's because without these
55:21 individual paradigms we don't get those
55:23 lessons what if you came back as a
55:26 wraith you never quite have a physical
55:29 body you're tormented in your form and
55:32 you unfortunately you got a feed off the
55:35 souls of other people or something like
55:36 that and you're like man it can't be bad
55:39 to be a wraith because God made wraiths
55:42 right I don't think they exist
55:44 necessarily but something's got to
55:46 explain monarchs oh I recently wrote a
55:50 well I recently rewrote a film of mine
55:53 about the Irish
55:55 hero kou : and in the rewrite something
56:02 stumbled into my mind while I was typing
56:05 away it's already a paragraph there and
56:08 the story is about a two factions from
56:14 Connick and ulster going at it it's an
56:16 ex-wife going after her ex-husband who's
56:19 King and she was banished to conquer bar
56:22 which at the time was very very tough to
56:25 live in because there was no modern
56:27 amenities and so she jeopardizes the
56:31 entire belief system of Ireland which is
56:33 their entire world they don't know about
56:35 the rest of the world at this point and
56:38 so the god lug Lu ji is looking down
56:44 this problem and he's with his wife and
56:45 his newborn up in the heavenly realm and
56:48 he's watching the king you know talk to
56:50 his elders and they're planning what
56:52 they're gonna do about this new invasion
56:54 that's going on and he goes you know
56:57 this is really bad honey and you know
56:59 I'm paraphrasing and she's like why you
57:02 know we war in our world why can't they
57:04 war in their world and he says to her he
57:09 says well this one's this one so bad
57:13 that if she wins she doesn't have a
57:15 belief in us and she'll erase us from
57:17 existence because there'll be no faith
57:19 that we exist and insinuating this
57:22 symbiotic relationship between our the
57:25 Samanas relationship excuse me between
57:27 humans belief systems and gods right and
57:32 so he says we're gonna have to go down
57:36 there I'm one of us has got to go down
57:38 there too to live among them to fix this
57:42 problem and she says well you know you
57:45 can't do this you run our whole kingdom
57:47 up here and you're old like how can you
57:49 go down there and that's when he looks
57:52 at her and he goes you know sometimes
57:55 yeah well she says can't you give them
57:57 with reason this is where we get to the
58:00 key point here and he says well it
58:02 doesn't work like that
58:03 he says less we turn them into
58:06 marionettes puppets right
58:09 you can't just put your hand in a human
58:11 being and make them do what you want
58:12 them to do unless you own Obama he said
58:17 no one of us has to go down and flush
58:18 because we must show them by example how
58:21 we do it what's righteous what is it
58:25 what's important what's not what's at
58:27 stake and what's it not at stake and so
58:30 she's like well you can't go down you're
58:32 old and out of a rut
58:33 and that's when she looks at him and he
58:34 looks at her and she's got the newborn
58:36 in her arm and he says sometimes gods
58:40 have to make sacrifices too and she's
58:43 looking at him like what are you saying
58:44 and then she looks at him looking at the
58:47 kid and she just says no [ __ ] way man
58:51 you take a my kid away from me and boom
58:53 the virgin birth happens on earth this
58:56 is 2500 BC by the way the story precedes
58:59 Christ by a long margin cou Collins born
59:04 as a demigod and he must live down there
59:08 and what did Christ do crisis born lives
59:11 and shows by example there's no such
59:14 thing as racism you will not do these
59:18 things that you've been doing and he
59:20 erases the Old Testament puts a whole
59:22 nother mechanism in there by example
59:26 well that's an archetype that has been
59:28 told I think 27 times and different mos
59:32 you know different factions of the world
59:36 it's an important archetype that it has
59:41 truth to it like again if you're new to
59:44 the show I don't think Jesus ever
59:46 existed especially because I wrote kou :
59:48 when I see everything that Christ did in
59:51 my film and it's based on a bunch of
59:54 based on oh my stager research I did it
59:57 was like a foot and a half thick of
59:59 paper not to mention a few books I had
60:02 to read a bunch of websites that weren't
60:04 part of the printed out stack but when
60:07 someone asks me why were here it would
60:13 seem that the my best my best example
60:16 for you is this
60:18 I am born as me you are born as you and
60:23 let's keep the idea there's one soul
60:25 because that makes a little easier for
60:27 this analogy maybe there's not maybe
60:28 there is maybe there's nothing I don't
60:30 know
60:31 pretty sure there's something I know for
60:34 a fact that my little home town I'm from
60:37 10,000 people roughly had I been born
60:42 into just the 10,000 people that lived
60:45 in my own town while I lived there I was
60:49 everybody I was the postman I was the
60:51 teacher the cook at the grade school I
60:56 went to if I lived all their lives and I
61:01 could remember an overlap all of the
61:03 experiences on top of each other and
61:05 compare them I'm sure I would find a lot
61:09 of similarities but at no point just
61:12 like a snowflake I would never ever ever
61:15 live the same life I would never ever be
61:18 able to say I learned nothing new from
61:21 this new life I would be able to say at
61:25 all times well you know what it was
61:26 pretty similar to my neighbor that I
61:29 lived next to was born the same day I
61:31 was born at the same number of kids
61:32 married the same lady type of lady
61:35 that's a lady but that's why I think
61:39 we're human because the soul is like a
61:43 dream right I dream at night like I've
61:46 told you guys a million times and again
61:48 I am brewing up a new dream episode
61:49 trying to focus the theme but I dream a
61:54 whole nother world it is not this world
61:57 but it looks like this world the people
62:00 I meet aren't me they're very similar to
62:02 the people in this world but the one
62:04 thing that I've noticed and this might
62:07 be part of the theme of the next episode
62:09 about dreams so here's your preview what
62:12 my dreams seldom have is challenge I'm
62:17 having a good time from the moment I get
62:20 into a dream world to the moment I leave
62:23 and again I dream in real time so I know
62:25 about you guys but this [ __ ] about
62:27 you have all your nights dreams in like
62:28 two seconds like [ __ ]
62:31 I go to sleep I start dreaming I'll wake
62:33 up roll over
62:34 hop right back in the dream it was the
62:37 distance I feel like I've slept for
62:39 hours and I've had four hours of this
62:41 world I'm gonna take a leak I'm back to
62:43 bed it's all real time but I realized
62:47 the other day when I got up that these
62:50 dream worlds are like they're not as I
62:54 want to say it's not as satisfying as
62:57 this world because the in the dream
63:00 world I have very little negativity of
63:03 any kind and you know when I was younger
63:06 you know used to be
63:08 I lose my car something ripped it off or
63:11 you really you found a girl that I found
63:14 a girl I really like some dream person
63:15 that doesn't exist and I mean we have an
63:17 intimate moment of some kind doesn't it
63:19 to be sex or anything like that and I
63:21 fall in love with this person almost
63:23 instantaneously because my mind is
63:24 making the perfect girl for me and then
63:28 I lose her in the dream so that's like
63:31 the most conflict but I haven't had any
63:33 conflict in a long time I don't have I
63:37 don't lose my car anymore it's crazy and
63:40 I don't meet people that mean that much
63:43 to me you know well have a good time
63:45 with everybody it's just like a really
63:46 good time it's like a vacation
63:48 that's perfect every time I go to sleep
63:50 mmm but then I wake up and I'm like oh
63:54 [ __ ] there are aches and pains in this
63:56 world right you can throw your back out
63:59 in this world you could lose your job in
64:01 this world you could have something you
64:03 want to do that you can't get done
64:04 because you need other people to
64:06 participate interesting big difference
64:11 so in my world my dream state you know
64:15 I'm always asking the question why the
64:16 hell do we sleep
64:17 my world it's like it's the relaxation
64:20 it's the vacation every single night I
64:22 go to bed and when I wake up I now as
64:29 understanding the difference between
64:30 those two worlds itemizing the
64:32 difference in the fabric of what that's
64:35 doing to me the dream world helps me
64:38 remember my dreams my aspirations as a
64:42 person and the utter potential of my
64:44 being
64:44 do I write movies in my dreams no I
64:47 don't do that but when I wake up I'm
64:51 ready to go it's sort of like I'm lucky
64:56 to be in this world where things go
64:57 wrong every once in a while sometimes
64:59 things go wrong for prolonged periods of
65:01 time that we just don't understand I
65:03 have an episode I believe it's called
65:06 creating the universe and it gets into
65:07 the real subatomic thoughts of man girl
65:12 sorry
65:14 the soul world living in this eternal Q
65:17 continuum and eventually saying look man
65:20 we've got to fix this we need a whole
65:22 nother ecosystem of life because sitting
65:24 around in this desert gas station
65:26 reading this newspaper forever having
65:28 had every conversation that there is to
65:31 have having done everything in the
65:35 universe insulting everyone
65:36 alphabetically in the universe you know
65:38 as Douglas Adams wrote in his book well
65:42 what do you think what do you how do we
65:44 gonna fix this and let's go well
65:46 remember what it was like to be a kid
65:48 and not know everything
65:49 maybe the Q continuum wouldn't be a good
65:51 example of that but if they could
65:53 remember that someone might say yeah
65:55 that was awesome right
65:57 you used to Christmas meant a whole
66:00 different thing
66:00 losing your tooth been a whole different
66:02 thing yeah that was fun how do we do
66:07 this then well I know let's create
66:12 another form similar an archetype to us
66:15 and let's climb into it like a little
66:18 avatar and let's say we we limit the
66:23 lifespan and we you know we limit to
66:27 like a hundred years well that sounds
66:29 great and then what is it that we we
66:32 wake up with in this avatar and we don't
66:34 have all of our memories yeah let's get
66:37 rid of the proprietary memories of who
66:39 we were our first name our last name who
66:41 our parents were in the previous life
66:43 and let's reset all that and let's make
66:45 a bunch of us and we'll be each other's
66:47 parents and stuff it sounds awesome and
66:50 so we start that world up but we always
66:53 die at a hundred years just like [ __ ]
66:55 Logan's Run men renew
66:57 ready the palm starts lighting so
66:59 flickering red all right we do that for
67:03 maybe few millennia billion millennia
67:06 who knows and someone gets the idea you
67:09 know be cool yeah what you're telling
67:13 off in the gym after you pop out of your
67:15 body and you're back in this other
67:17 celestial Q continuum world you're in
67:19 the design drawing board room I thought
67:24 this idea what if what if we introduce a
67:27 little bit of randomness in it what are
67:29 you thinking well you know how
67:31 everything is like pretty awesome in
67:32 this world that we made yeah well what
67:35 if we let you know some stuff go wrong
67:37 you know maybe maybe you die at like 25
67:39 and well how would you die at 25 that's
67:42 so young I don't know like that car
67:44 thing we made yeah that's a [ __ ] hit
67:46 you oh yeah yeah yeah but you know I
67:49 guess we'd have to make the bodies more
67:50 fragile okay have you seen this water
67:52 balloon let's make one like that boom
67:54 Homo sapiens sapiens right but we
67:57 introduced this random effect and what
68:00 does that do hmm well if you lived a
68:04 hundred years which by any stretch of
68:05 imagination for a modern human being
68:08 they always we always think that's not
68:10 very long and you know who would have
68:13 liked to have seen Tesla live another
68:14 five hundred [ __ ] years me right who
68:19 would have liked to see in Stanley
68:20 Kubrick live another couple hundred
68:21 years you imagine how amazing the movies
68:24 we get all right but just like a good
68:30 movie when you're as a writer you're
68:32 supposed to establish to the audience
68:34 what's at stake you want the audience to
68:37 value something in the story being alive
68:40 being in love getting a chance to have
68:44 your biggest dream come true right got a
68:48 contest you got to win the contest to
68:50 have a chance to be this thing I may be
68:51 you're gonna automatically be this thing
68:52 that kind of thing and then you
68:54 introduce the element of surprise that
68:57 will challenge that person getting that
69:01 dream and you write two hours of that
69:03 whole thing well if you wake up in this
69:07 new world this adjusted world
69:09 it says well all right guys you can die
69:13 anytime you want I mean anytime that
69:15 some happens you gotta follow some rules
69:17 here and be careful with your your
69:19 little water balloon you call your body
69:21 and we start that up maybe we don't even
69:27 think it through that much I'm being
69:30 facetious of course but let's just go
69:32 with that and you get a best friend in
69:35 the world right and your best friend
69:38 dies in a motorcycle accident right at
69:42 19 years old and you're like oh my god I
69:48 love that dude he's dead he's gone
69:51 meaning we don't get a chance to play
69:54 pinball anymore we don't get a chance to
69:55 hang out anymore hmm I'm speaking from
70:00 experience on that I think back towards
70:03 uh my ears in my late high school years
70:07 I get back on this affect of this whole
70:10 thing but I had a really really good
70:13 friend that I was totally I'll eyes the
70:15 guy he was just one of those really
70:16 super cool guys very fair awesome dude
70:20 and he died at 19 I was 16 at the time
70:26 and so he died and two things happened
70:30 to me one I noticed right away in one
70:33 that has dawned on me and probably last
70:36 five years of my life one I had at this
70:40 overwhelming urge to go live a life that
70:44 was insane right pack my [ __ ] move what
70:50 is it 1,800 miles away something like
70:52 that and to live for my buddy who didn't
70:56 get a chance to live past the age of 19
70:58 I don't know what his dreams were but I
71:01 I kind of Celeste really invited him I
71:03 said let's do this buddy come with me
71:05 we're gonna make this happen and boy did
71:07 we ever make it happen it was awesome
71:09 right but in my later years I thought
71:11 back to how comfortable I was in this
71:15 circle of friends and how much I would
71:18 have continued to to know more and more
71:22 of these guys
71:22 were a little bit older than me and it
71:25 may have been a situation where him
71:27 passing away made me want to go be
71:30 something that needed me to leave the
71:33 geographical location that I was very
71:35 content with them and I love my own town
71:37 as you guys probably already know but I
71:39 might have stayed now I would have made
71:43 a great life probably wherever I ended
71:45 up but the one I ended up pushing
71:48 through there was a lot of sacrifices I
71:49 I made by getting away from my family
71:51 and not being able to come home and take
71:53 care of like you know sick grandparents
71:56 and that kind of stuff which I would
71:57 have loved to have done but that event
72:01 taught me the value of my own life
72:04 taught me to go ahead and take risks
72:06 because life is potentially very very
72:09 short it is short no matter how you
72:12 slice it right the more aware you are in
72:15 the world which is every single one of
72:17 you the more you value every day it
72:21 doesn't mean you can have moments of
72:23 despair right you might even get
72:24 suicidal at one point because something
72:26 is very acutely happening to you very
72:29 sudden shift and happiness and you got
72:32 to understand time fixes everything all
72:35 right so go watch my episode on suicide
72:37 if you want a little a little bit of
72:41 juice
72:41 go watch getting up and being lost those
72:45 episodes will help you out quite a bit
72:47 and if you're struggling with alcoholism
72:48 go watch that episode - it's on the
72:51 self-improvement playlist you sharing my
72:55 experiences right but now imagine a
72:58 being that's never really dealt with
73:01 death what would happen if everybody was
73:05 born on the same day and you had a
73:09 fail-safe system there's no way to die
73:10 and y'all died 100 years old okay so you
73:15 all have the same birthday and you had
73:16 the same death day and so we all come
73:19 out into the gym afterwards we do our
73:21 showers we do dinners we laugh oh my god
73:23 you look so weird and that body yeah
73:26 that was so strange man I got really fat
73:28 I got really thin you know I got really
73:30 thin I thought I was fat you know but
73:34 every day would it be
73:36 not much at risk there be a challenge to
73:38 maybe become something and now imagine
73:41 the first time through that system when
73:44 one of the your best buds that you've
73:46 had for millennia right you don't know
73:49 it because you've erased your memory but
73:51 you do know it afterwards you do know it
73:54 when you're alive right in this new body
73:56 and your buddy taps out at 19 and you're
73:59 sixteen like well geez even if I live a
74:02 short life I'm probably going to 75 80
74:04 years old okay that means you're gonna
74:08 spend more life without your friend than
74:11 with your friend even if your friend has
74:13 touched you in such a way that you will
74:16 always be a better person because you
74:17 ran into their little circle and you're
74:21 gonna miss them but when you find a new
74:23 friend who's got the same kind of
74:26 qualities now you're like ah I can
74:29 cherish this I can cherish the value of
74:33 life well why did God build the world
74:36 mmm the way he built it the way that we
74:39 exist in it today again can be infinite
74:42 numbers of life forms in the universe
74:44 you know it could be your frequency your
74:46 your color one time right with some life
74:50 cycles somehow what we are being taught
74:53 by being human beings is as infinite in
74:57 its importance and its educational arc
75:01 its wisdom / knowledge / intelligence by
75:06 all by taking what you're academically
75:08 at collecting and then testing it right
75:12 how many different things could happen
75:14 in the combinations of human beings on
75:17 planet Earth from the day that planet
75:19 Earth could sustain human life to the
75:22 day we foresee it not being able to
75:24 sustain life in the future how many
75:27 combinations are there between male and
75:29 female and then all the different races
75:31 and all the different geographical
75:33 origin points and then all the
75:35 technological errors that you can live
75:37 through maybe we have an apocalypse in
75:40 the future go play fallout 4 you'll find
75:43 a whole nother batch of life if you go
75:46 watch Walking Dead or any of these other
75:47 shows
75:48 then there's maybe euphoric George
75:51 Jetson eras Bladerunner eras right 2010
75:55 eras 2001 eras right whatever the answer
76:00 is unequivocally pound-for-pound
76:04 infinite so imagine this how many of us
76:12 are striving in our lifetime to learn as
76:14 much as we can and experience as much
76:17 wisdom as we can what if we were just a
76:20 soul poof sitting out there and the
76:23 ether or with everybody else but we're
76:25 maybe in heaven as they define it for us
76:28 right you're just doing the same thing
76:31 every day every day it's just great day
76:34 perfect weather eating all this
76:36 chocolate and whatever they'll you want
76:38 to eat having all this sugar rush taking
76:40 all the drugs you want as much sex as
76:42 you want within some heavenly sanction
76:45 there with your monogamous partner you
76:48 would learn [ __ ] all about being alive
76:52 you would but what do you learn by being
76:56 in this world potentially if there
77:00 especially there's only one soul and
77:01 you're everything all the time some
77:04 start to finish in just this planet in
77:08 this paradigm whatever this place is
77:10 right simulation a flat or disk whatever
77:12 the globe floating through space doesn't
77:15 even matter that that external question
77:17 doesn't even matter because in this form
77:20 of life that we are very familiar with
77:23 we get to learn over and over and over
77:27 again more and more and more
77:30 now there's the big question that is you
77:38 know are we improving our soul pattern
77:41 it's what I like to call it right it's
77:42 the pattern of you that is the energy
77:44 that is you again not electrons it'll be
77:47 trying to find us in some geiger counter
77:50 I don't think that's gonna happen
77:51 although I want to throw a little
77:53 interesting notion at you here in a
77:54 second but what if we do take on the
77:59 wisdom of what we experience
78:02 either in part or in whole when we
78:04 transition come back around do this
78:07 again right I'm a very big proponent of
78:10 reincarnation not based on any organized
78:12 religion may be the overall mean of what
78:16 we are simply becomes more intelligent
78:19 and more intelligent and more amazing
78:21 and we can stomach it because we don't
78:23 remember doing it again you're doing it
78:26 before excuse me this is gonna be a
78:29 total side bonus round of thinking this
78:33 has nothing to do necessarily with this
78:35 episode so I don't think I could make a
78:37 whole episode about it but this
78:39 something occurred to me downstairs
78:41 where we actually smoke the cigars most
78:43 of the time we were watching a bunch of
78:49 the brand-new Fukushima videos that have
78:53 come out and there was millions and
78:55 millions of cellphones firing out that
78:57 that event and we've seen some pretty
78:59 phenomenal things and we were trying to
79:01 understand by watching it you know how
79:04 they couldn't fear this wave coming in
79:06 because they'd never seen anything like
79:07 that in their life so a lot of people
79:09 were swept away a lot of them majority
79:12 of them did at least try to get to
79:14 higher ground but a lot of people got
79:16 swept away because they just couldn't
79:17 fathom the big giant 15-foot wall not
79:21 working to hold back whatever was coming
79:23 in right but there's been a lot of folks
79:26 that have tried to find the soul through
79:29 some instrumentality right some some
79:31 sensitive piece of frequency equipment
79:33 or something right in a dawned on me
79:36 that it's sort of a morbid experiment
79:41 but if you had a situation where a bunch
79:44 of people pass away in a really close
79:47 timespan and even in a geographical span
79:49 right these waves went through cities
79:51 right and you know they lost something
79:54 like twenty five thousand people they
79:55 don't know where they are or they
79:57 definitely found them and they perished
79:58 but a ton of people are missing and
80:00 they'll never be found you know it's a
80:02 very very heartbreaking situation for
80:04 those folks and they've done an amazing
80:06 job rebuilding let's put that way an
80:08 amazing job hats off to the Japanese men
80:12 but during a catastrophic death perhaps
80:15 there is a mechanism by which so much
80:19 soul energy is being released that the
80:22 density of that might be perceivable in
80:25 some fashion
80:26 I'll just throw that out to you guys
80:29 what has been one of the big themes of
80:31 this show since the beginning
80:33 we're all having these thoughts and no
80:36 one's talking about it but these
80:38 thoughts sometimes utterly plagued us
80:40 for years you know there's the whole
80:42 saying you can't unsee what you see and
80:46 it's a very important statement that's
80:48 how a lot of us are waking up right
80:50 we're seeing the corruption we're seeing
80:52 the cause and effect models of all this
80:53 stuff right bankers can no longer hide
80:57 in this planet I mean it is just their
80:59 days are numbered
81:00 unless there's a catastrophic weapon
81:02 they can use to kill all of us and save
81:04 all themselves it's over
81:07 the game is over it might take us 50
81:09 years to get rid of them but it's over
81:11 man okay the world's gonna be a very
81:13 different place and probably again if
81:15 they don't pull some big number on us
81:17 it's gonna be well within a hundred
81:20 years this plant it's gonna be a lot
81:22 better off right but there's also that
81:26 tenacious thing called an idea or what
81:29 we call in this show enlightenment if if
81:35 I do this experiment with you guys every
81:40 once in a while which is to say what if
81:42 God showed up and somehow could prove it
81:45 to you and they said let me show you
81:48 something
81:49 and just first split second yields an
81:51 eight-by-ten up and then puts it down
81:54 and in that eight-by-ten is something
81:56 that shifts your entire view of where
81:59 you are who you are what's possible all
82:02 that stuff and you can put something in
82:04 the photograph that matters to you it
82:07 would be very difficult to go to sleep
82:08 that night wouldn't it because you will
82:12 not be able to get that amazing
82:13 enlightenment moment this new
82:15 information that gives you extra
82:17 perception of reality you know I can
82:21 imagine as an example of some of those
82:23 some of you that believe intimately that
82:25 we're in a flatter
82:26 earth he shows you something that proves
82:29 that that's the case and he'll you're
82:32 even more confused right you're like
82:34 well if it's flat and you're proving it
82:37 to me and what the hell were the stars
82:39 what are the planets why are they all
82:40 around and we're flat and all this other
82:41 stuff you're gonna be just bit by a bug
82:45 that won't let you go and I think that a
82:48 lot of the subjects I'm trying to pick
82:50 on this show even though they might seem
82:52 not flashy like you know moon hoax stuff
82:54 it's important to you to you personally
82:58 right and you know from judging from the
83:02 comments of course I always tell you
83:03 guys the IQs out there that watch the
83:06 show or so beyond my own I learned so
83:09 much from you guys it's absolutely
83:11 fascinating I'm enlightened by you guys
83:15 several times a week just from comments
83:18 sometimes it's one sentence that just
83:20 goes holy crap absolutely there's a lot
83:24 of you that have you've reached that
83:26 level of existentialism where you are
83:30 combining ether particles into time
83:33 you're combining that into spirituality
83:37 some of you understand that we do
83:40 control reality perception and quantum
83:43 physics experiments prove that we alter
83:45 experiments by looking at them I mean
83:48 it's pretty hefty right that's pretty
83:50 huge keep going keep going keep parsing
83:56 reality we are we are utter virgins
84:00 I think with this information now
84:02 there's some folks out there that have
84:03 put a lot of thought into these things
84:05 like Marshall McLuhan put a lot of
84:07 thought into some of this stuff but a
84:08 lot of them even though the great
84:10 philosophers they're dealing with where
84:12 they are and they're just saying I don't
84:14 want explain what I don't know I want to
84:16 explain what I can figure out and they
84:17 figured out something more introverted
84:18 towards mankind something very
84:20 functional valuable and then you'll go
84:22 off to Jean Baudrillard
84:24 and read his books and your brain will
84:26 hurt there the tiniest tiniest little
84:28 thin books but I tell you what every
84:31 page is like a full steak dinner so I
84:34 it's like a nine-course meal I will
84:38 often read his
84:39 books and I'll read a page like three
84:42 times and because I read it and I'm
84:44 getting part of it and then I read it
84:45 again I'm like oh there's another layer
84:47 another layer my god this guy's brain is
84:49 like I mean that guy's like you must
84:52 have been far out like 200 plus so
84:58 anyway I thought this would be valuable
84:59 for us to go through it sort of ties a
85:03 lot of loose ends up from other episodes
85:05 so hopefully that is the effect it's
85:08 having on you guys again super
85:10 interested to hear what you guys think
85:12 and you know the other thing I want to
85:16 suggest in the comments section of all
85:18 the videos that you watch that try to
85:22 think of new subjects that are covered
85:23 in any of the any of the videos there
85:25 was 350 videos roughly with the special
85:29 reports so I understand if that's kind
85:31 of difficult but throw it out there and
85:32 I'll let you know if I'm in an episode
85:33 on it you might just take an episode and
85:35 create part two by saying you should
85:37 talk about this like maybe you give me
85:39 afterlife which I've done several times
85:41 and but you have a new spin on it and it
85:44 totally changes me and then I'll sit and
85:46 think about it for a month or a week or
85:48 whatever and all crank out a part too
85:50 it'll be as a result of your perception
85:53 enlightening me right so anyway if you
85:57 haven't been to deep thoughts radio.com
