00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts today we're gonna cover a
00:39 subject that's gaining speed online
00:43 speeding all the conspiratorial circles
00:46 and one that has been has been and will
00:50 be continued to be used to exploit the
00:56 sale of products that perhaps you don't
00:58 need but we're gonna go through it just
01:01 in case it does happen this is about the
01:05 collapse of the Federal Reserve Bank a
01:08 bank that is as federal as Federal
01:11 Express as they always say the Federal
01:14 Express is obviously not a federally
01:17 funded business I think it should be
01:22 passed as an amendment or a law that no
01:26 business should be able to use the word
01:30 Federal in their nit title and we need
01:33 to pick every other word that would
01:36 signify a government institution such
01:42 that these companies cannot pawn
01:43 themselves off as something more
01:46 official than they really are really
01:49 sorry you got to rename yourself right
01:51 Federal Express you can just be FedEx
01:52 right the word federal should be
01:56 reserved for something run by us now
02:01 what's interesting is is you know a lot
02:03 of you are woke as they say and you try
02:08 to wake people up with little statements
02:14 things that make them go hmm you know
02:19 and one of the best questions I've ever
02:22 heard asked of official story people is
02:26 what do you know about the Federal
02:28 Reserve nothing usually is it a federal
02:32 institution well of course it is no it's
02:34 not what do you mean it's a private
02:36 for-profit bank its members the people
02:39 who own the organization are 80%
02:42 concealed hmm but we the people own 10%
02:47 of their institution now I just recently
02:51 said that in episode I want to make sure
02:52 you guys understand I learned everything
02:55 I know about the Federal Reserve from
02:57 two people online bills still STI ll and
03:03 Aaron Rizzo who's passed because you got
03:10 stomach cancer right after making a
03:11 documentary busting the Federal Reserve
03:14 and the IRS for their fraudulent
03:19 electorial voluntary tax system on your
03:22 wages that is portrayed to the people as
03:24 a mandatory tax the only mandatory tax
03:29 in the United States of America is
03:31 federal taxes Tobacco and Firearms your
03:36 wages are your property that's what the
03:38 founders of America ensured in the
03:41 Constitution and that is the thing they
03:43 went right after to blur the lines on so
03:45 that they could tax you again
03:49 the only legal tax against wages which
03:51 would have to be again a two-thirds
03:52 majority vote and amendment to the
03:55 Constitution the United States would be
03:57 an apportioned tax which means everyone
04:02 gets taxed at a flat rate the second to
04:05 you vary the tax brackets you're now
04:07 against the Constitution of the United
04:08 States there's no law or statute that
04:10 says you have to pay taxes on your wages
04:13 but they hate it when you say that we do
04:15 it anyway because we don't need the deep
04:18 state of our [ __ ] but if what we're
04:21 going to be talking about today occurs
04:23 then all that changes right
04:26 maybe we elect to go ahead and change
04:30 the Constitution such that that your
04:33 wages or your property as amended to be
04:36 different maybe the idea was that if you
04:42 hear like some official story person
04:44 coming at you about taxes well we got to
04:45 pay for stuff
04:46 hey you're absolutely correct and that's
04:48 what corporations were supposed to do so
04:50 all these banking oligarchy families in
04:53 their their proxies went to a little
04:55 island called Jekyll Island and they
04:58 schemed together
05:00 this case sixteenth amendment which came
05:03 with the IRS
05:06 it was never ratified by all the states
05:09 so they went in under gunpoint
05:11 probably some Pinkerton power I believe
05:15 Philadelphia I think Tennessee and
05:18 Kentucky and Oklahoma all reported in
05:20 that on Christmas Eve state officials
05:25 were held at gunpoint to vote YES on the
05:28 sixteenth amendment now what really
05:30 happened
05:31 it was definitely some [ __ ] but so
05:36 William Hearst the gentleman I'm giving
05:39 this background because this is where
05:40 the institution comes from William
05:43 Hearst the big yellow journalism guy
05:45 yellow journalism is when a newspaper
05:47 lies to create reality right it's
05:50 basically fake news and it's been around
05:53 for over 150 years okay
05:55 at least in the United States of America
05:59 they got a poor history professor we're
06:02 drill Wilson to run for president
06:04 following up the first skullenbones
06:06 President Taft the big fat guy they got
06:11 on the back of a train and drove all
06:14 around America and the little caboose
06:16 parties right and they said that the
06:19 16th amendment had been ratified and so
06:22 everybody said hurrah hurrah because it
06:24 was sold to them as a typical left
06:28 progressive Robin Hood socialistic bunch
06:30 of [ __ ] that they were only going to
06:32 tax the corporations and not the people
06:36 when the corporations were already taxed
06:39 it's so stupid we were about this whole
06:41 thing but the tax code was immediately
06:45 rewritten with infinite loopholes for
06:48 corporations that can zero out their
06:50 books and never pay taxes and stuck it
06:53 all to the people as I heard it I
06:55 believe from bill still or a resource of
06:59 that nature they gathered three hundred
07:01 and sixty million dollars in the first
07:03 year they collected taxes in this
07:05 country Franz Ferdinand is murdered in
07:09 Europe starts World War one they try to
07:13 drag us in simply because the
07:14 want us to borrow money no other reason
07:16 there's no moral reason there's no rhyme
07:19 or reason to it other than to make us
07:20 borrow money we a million miles away
07:24 from that problem sort of broke said you
07:28 know we don't need this we don't need
07:30 this war we stayed at it until 1917 then
07:33 we push in like we save about 11 months
07:36 and the war's over and so they didn't
07:39 get what they wanted but they had a plan
07:42 after plan after plan so the 1920s which
07:44 you'll hear is the Roaring Twenties was
07:46 actually a decade where they were raping
07:48 all of those individuals who escaped
07:50 Europe with their money and set up shop
07:53 here in America they were lured into
07:55 horrible investment vehicles which
07:58 almond tits up in 1929 they rescinded
08:02 three-fourths of the cash out of
08:03 circulation in the United States because
08:05 they controlled it through the Federal
08:06 Reserve and then everywhere they
08:09 possibly could they called in the notes
08:11 meaning the loans exercising a little
08:14 tiny clause in the bottom of the
08:15 contract it said you know under under
08:18 like freak circumstances we can ask you
08:21 to pay off your loan and you went ahead
08:22 and signed it because never in the
08:23 history has anyone ever exercised that
08:25 clause well that year they exercised all
08:27 of them they tell you that a bunch of
08:30 financial financial people and bankers
08:32 threw themselves out of windows
08:34 committing suicide because they lost all
08:37 their money now maybe that happened once
08:39 or twice but the majority of the people
08:42 that jumped from a window were being
08:44 thrown out of [ __ ] windows because
08:45 they figured out the scam they were in
08:48 on it so deep that they could finger all
08:50 the people involved so now we have a
08:54 little bit of money we loaned borrowed
08:56 for the war World War one for us to say
08:59 that we were in World War one and that
09:01 we participated and we won World War one
09:04 for Americans it's a [ __ ] joke
09:06 okay we were barely over there we barely
09:09 contributed to jack-shit sure we walked
09:11 in and took the drunk guy who's already
09:13 been punched in the face a thousand
09:14 times and punched him in the nose one
09:16 time and of course he falls down like a
09:17 feather that's not being you know
09:21 even fair okay what would that 1830s
09:26 about how the federal reserve play a
09:27 role in that
09:29 well again the same people that created
09:32 the Federal Reserve are now running our
09:34 country because they control our money
09:35 go look at the Rothschilds from the
09:37 1800s they said I care not who passes
09:39 the laws as long as I control their
09:41 currency because as long as I control
09:42 their currency everyone has a price
09:45 right 1930s were all about seizing the
09:49 gold from the middle class getting
09:51 everyone converted to shitty fiat
09:53 currency and taking all the real
09:54 currency gold and silver and pushing it
09:58 into Fort Knox which was then
10:00 immediately put on trains and shipped
10:03 all over the place probably a bunch in
10:05 New York but a bunch probably went to
10:07 Europe as well Fort Knox is named after
10:10 a guy named Philander Knox not the Navy
10:12 admiral that they always tell you that's
10:14 a bunch of [ __ ] why Philander Knox
10:16 Philander Knox is a gentleman who was an
10:19 attorney for all the big families
10:22 Rockefellers Rothschilds Vanderbilt's
10:26 Carnegie's Morgans he was their lead
10:30 dude he was he drafted probably the
10:32 initial sixteenth amendment he was
10:35 inserted into the White House out of
10:36 private practice for those families
10:38 right at the turn of the 20th century by
10:43 1934 we are in a massive depression that
10:46 they contributed to starting in 1929
10:50 they forced everyone out of their gold
10:52 and the only way that we're allowed to
10:54 get out of the depression is to get
10:56 involved with the war that is raging
10:58 from the very orchestrated and created
11:02 Adolf Hitler and Europe now maybe one
11:06 day I'll do a World War 2 episode and go
11:08 through the issues surrounding that
11:12 because it's unraveling the history that
11:15 you've been taught your whole life it's
11:16 beautifully being undone with facts ok
11:21 that's the beautiful thing
11:24 but we go into 1941 December 7th the
11:27 false flag known as Pearl Harbor
11:32 for anyone who struggles with the Pearl
11:35 Harbor being a false flag there's a
11:36 couple pieces of evidence but I'll tell
11:38 you one of the greatest pieces of
11:39 evidence is that my stepfather who
11:42 believes every official story on planet
11:43 earth did his research and came back to
11:46 me about 10 years ago and he said you
11:48 know you're right about Pearl Harbor
11:49 that was completely orchestrated I mean
11:51 completely Orchestra I said yeah so but
11:57 the other you know we embargo the the
11:59 strategic resources from going into
12:02 Japan we gave them no choice but to come
12:04 down and attack us very cause-and-effect
12:06 model there we too had two big Navy
12:10 fleets down by Hawaii both Admirals were
12:12 told to drive their fleets what out east
12:15 and west and do circles and they said
12:17 well sir we know that they're coming we
12:19 can bar go to all their stuff and the
12:22 president united states said you do what
12:26 you're told that's why you get to get
12:28 the big bucks right both gentlemen after
12:31 Pearl Harbor within I guess 30 days were
12:35 given the naval equivalent of the Medal
12:38 of Honor and both families have actually
12:39 held a press conference at Honolulu off
12:44 Oahu and proved that those medals were
12:47 awarded for basically doing what they're
12:50 told but in the public eye they were
12:53 scorned because they were out
12:55 gallivanting around while Pearl Harbor
12:59 was getting bombed okay so you have two
13:04 layers to the Federal Reserve you have
13:06 the institution that is again a private
13:07 for-profit bank just like any bank
13:09 you've ever gone to there's nothing to
13:11 do with the federal government except it
13:16 its owners are categorically European in
13:24 the 1800s the United States there were
13:26 several efforts to start such a bank and
13:28 again right around 1800 we had an
13:30 equivalent equivalency of this type of
13:32 bank and in 1811 the lease came up on
13:35 that Bank
13:36 and nor it basically our agreement to
13:39 let them operate in this country
13:41 and we said no thanks on the war of 1812
13:45 broke out which said we're gonna
13:47 continue pounding you with all the
13:48 resources from Europe until you sign
13:50 that Bank back into function we cowered
13:54 down signed because we were we were not
13:57 in any financial or military position to
14:01 fight them indefinitely
14:03 after the Revolutionary War right so you
14:06 know we bought some time Andrew Jackson
14:10 came in in the 1830s and held them off
14:15 for a little bit longer but then they
14:17 pushed back in then Lincoln trying to
14:20 fight the Civil War had to borrow some
14:22 money to pay his soldiers he goes to the
14:24 Rothschilds and I I think according to
14:27 bill still they were going to loan
14:31 Lincoln money at 3,600 percent interest
14:35 can you [ __ ] imagine it's
14:38 unbelievable man you borrow a dollar and
14:41 it's 36 bucks back
14:44 when they know you need it they [ __ ] you
14:46 right that's evil that is absolute evil
14:50 hey man you can take a fee for loaning
14:53 someone money but that kind of interest
14:55 is just incredible and it's most likely
14:57 compound interest as well so Lincoln
14:59 prints the the greenback he prints our
15:02 own money and says screw you I'll back
15:04 up by our gross national product or
15:06 gross domestic domestic product screw
15:08 you and they shot him in the back of the
15:10 head why he's watching a play that's why
15:14 he was murdered but we knew our
15:17 politicians knew they were trying to
15:19 pull this game and so took him another
15:21 50 years to get it past sixteenth
15:24 movement allowing the formation and
15:27 dependency on fiat currency to a foreign
15:32 bank
15:34 now in order to understand what steps we
15:37 would take during a collapse you have to
15:39 understand how their money functions
15:41 it's been given examples have been given
15:44 visual examples have been given in the
15:45 movie zeitgeist the very first one he
15:47 does a pretty good job there's two
15:50 factors that are really important how
15:51 the money is created and then how it is
15:53 loaned out given this example several
15:57 times in my lifetime and a couple times
15:59 on the show we need to review when you
16:04 think about someone loaning you money a
16:06 neighbor or a friend you don't sweat too
16:08 much unless you're borrowing a
16:09 tremendous amount of money but when you
16:11 borrow from the Federal Reserve as a as
16:14 the sole creator of your currency it's a
16:18 different game that's not because it's a
16:21 lot of money it's because it's the only
16:22 money what does that mean okay you and I
16:26 are sitting across from a table I'll
16:29 play the Federal Reserve so you know to
16:30 be the bad guy
16:32 the initial example is it's just you and
16:34 I friends and you need to borrow a
16:36 dollar and say I say okay I'll loan you
16:40 a dollar but you owe me 10 cents back
16:41 more when you pay me back
16:43 it's a 10 percent interest here sign
16:47 this contract that says you're gonna pay
16:48 me back a dollar 10 when you pay me back
16:51 on these terms
16:52 now contract is what we call a piece of
16:55 paper that it creates an agreement
16:57 between two people but when you go
16:59 between a bank and a country they call
17:01 that a bond same time you hear a bond
17:04 war bond all that bonds it's basically
17:06 an agreement to pay back the person who
17:10 bonds themselves to it but if I loan you
17:13 a dollar I literally pushed a dollar
17:15 across the table and I say okay now pay
17:18 me back immediately
17:19 you don't even capable of spending the
17:22 money yet
17:23 and you're like oh okay here's your
17:25 dollar back I say now now I need 10
17:27 cents more because you sign that
17:29 agreement right there and you're like
17:30 okay well I got 10 cents in my pocket I
17:33 got 10 cents somewhere in the couch sofa
17:35 over there I'll borrow 10 cents from a
17:37 neighbor you're not sweating it because
17:40 there's money outside of this agreement
17:42 and this is where most Americans don't
17:46 get it
17:48 that works because it's not the only
17:51 money source in the world now let's make
17:53 you the United States of America and I'm
17:55 the Federal Reserve I loan you a dollar
17:58 with a contract for you to pay me back a
18:00 dollar 10 this is the first day you've
18:02 ever had money the day after the 16th
18:04 amendment is passed let's just say and
18:07 then I'm a jerk and I say pay me back
18:09 right after I give you the money you're
18:13 like well here's your dollar back
18:14 where's my ten cents it says right here
18:17 you signed up ten cents more ten percent
18:20 interest on that dollar you're like well
18:22 I don't have any more of your money the
18:25 kind of money that you create because
18:27 you never created the dime extra so
18:30 there's no way for me to pay you
18:31 completely back you see how that gets to
18:34 be a Ponzi scheme it's an illegal loan
18:38 because it has a mathematical
18:39 impossibility but it is the way that the
18:42 16th amendment works with the United
18:44 States of America take any of the
18:47 printed money you have of United States
18:50 currency and flip it up flip it on the
18:52 back and read the top it says Federal
18:55 Reserve Note that means it's their
18:59 property even though our tax dollars pay
19:02 for the ink in the paper it's their
19:05 property a private for-profit bank owns
19:08 all of the printed money in the United
19:10 States
19:10 now what's sovereign money what's money
19:14 that they don't control all of our coins
19:17 depending nickel dime quarter half
19:20 dollar it's over dollar susan b anthony
19:23 those have been deemed legal tender and
19:26 they don't own it that's one reason why
19:29 they want to get rid of coins so every
19:34 single dollar that has been in existence
19:37 in America since 1913 has been illegally
19:42 created Ponzi scheme money let me repeat
19:46 that the money you hold in your hand
19:48 shouldn't exist the printed money
19:51 because it was loaned to us with the
19:54 physical mathematical and possibility to
19:56 ever pay off the loan of its creation
20:00 because the interest that you owe is
20:02 never ever ever created and so when
20:05 America comes back to the federal
20:07 reserve and says I can't pay the extra
20:08 ten cents the Federal Reserve simply
20:10 says that's no problem
20:12 I'll make the ten cents and you can
20:14 borrow that from me too at interest and
20:17 so it keeps going and it keeps going but
20:20 politicians don't care do they they
20:24 never they're gonna be in and out it's
20:25 not their money they want to do fun
20:28 things with the money they know people
20:31 need things they don't understand
20:32 economics to save their [ __ ] soul
20:34 economics is probably this the most
20:37 under educated subject in this country
20:42 of America and our president Donald
20:44 Trump just happens to have an
20:46 exceptional degree in it that's the
20:49 difference they say were trillions and
20:53 trillions of dollars in debt to these
20:56 exact bankers why are we in debt well
21:00 because we borrow a ton of money with
21:02 this crappy Ponzi scheme this illegal
21:05 [ __ ] Ponzi scheme then we're taxed as
21:11 citizens illegally because there's no
21:14 law or statute that says you must pay
21:16 taxes on your personal wages now if you
21:19 volunteer into the system if you file a
21:21 tax return you're in it you've got to
21:24 pay You've that's what the law says they
21:27 can come to your house and take all your
21:28 [ __ ] but they've been preying on the
21:32 ignorant which is why an errand rizzo
21:34 most likely no longer exists on this
21:36 planet so every single president in the
21:40 United States of America safe to since
21:43 1913 had puppets of the bankers the
21:49 skullenbones organization which as I'm
21:52 told migrated into the United States of
21:53 America and hid in the Yale University
21:54 in 1834 Andrew Jackson tried to find him
22:01 but he couldn't find him because he
22:02 didn't know they were in you their
22:05 Charter in 1834 was to take over the
22:08 United States of America by all
22:09 financial means necessary
22:11 they were the ambassador
22:13 the children of these banking families
22:16 they may not be the exact tippy-top
22:19 families but they're close enough and
22:21 they serve them well it's no surprise
22:25 that President Taft the first
22:28 skullenbones president that we ever had
22:30 introduced Philander Knox's draft of the
22:33 16th amendment now his name won't be on
22:37 those documents Philander but trust me
22:39 that's who put it together for us
22:44 we have since had at least two other
22:48 skull and bone presidents President
22:52 George Herbert Walker Bush and his son
22:56 George W Bush the Central Intelligence
22:59 Agency was formed exclusively for
23:02 approximately the first 20 years of its
23:04 existence out of Skull and Bones hmm
23:09 well who shot Kennedy again why did him
23:12 to get shot well he was gonna do two
23:15 things he figured it all out how he
23:19 figured it out baffles me right he
23:21 didn't have the internet a bunch of you
23:23 guys let him know what's going on he
23:26 figured out that the Federal Reserve was
23:29 doing what it was doing it was
23:31 impossible money scheme so he wanted to
23:33 shut it down replace it with our own
23:37 money he was going at silver first as
23:41 the mechanism to create enough currency
23:43 in people's pockets that they could
23:44 operate without using the notes trying
23:48 to kind of wean us off these fake pieces
23:52 of fiat we're gonna get the fresh the
23:54 fractional reserve banking in a second
23:56 but the other thing was is he realized
23:58 that this agency which had a couple
24:01 names was engaging in operations all
24:09 around the unit all around the world
24:11 excuse me using our piggy bank to take
24:14 over countries to give them to the
24:16 European owners of the Federal Reserve
24:19 so he wanted to get rid of that agency
24:21 as well
24:24 and they killed him a bunch of people
24:27 wanted him dead
24:29 LBJ wanted him dead because he wanted to
24:31 be President because he was just a
24:33 narcissistic piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] any
24:37 picture of LBJ should be taken off the
24:39 wall and burned that guy should just be
24:43 a race for [ __ ] history but a petty
24:47 petty man he was
24:49 they say Castro wanted him dead I don't
24:53 know he was refusing to allow the CIA to
24:57 invade Cuba
24:59 so sorta was helping Castro out and
25:02 trying to negotiate some sort of
25:04 settlement Castro's big problem was is
25:07 that he told the State Department that
25:10 you give me guns and training and I'll
25:13 take over this country and then I'll be
25:14 your ally so he takes over the country
25:19 uses our resources and then flips the
25:20 bird to the State Department and that's
25:23 when they said oh no no no we don't play
25:24 that game and that's why if I try to
25:26 smoke a Cuban cigar it's illegal in
25:29 America I mean go get your own but you
25:33 can't buy it from anybody pathetic now
25:38 the white man hangs on to grudges like
25:39 that
25:40 un-fuckin'-believable right but the
25:43 second problem that the 16th amendment
25:45 introduced with something called
25:49 fractional reserve banking fractional
25:52 reserve banking is the notion that well
25:55 what is fiat currency what is that well
25:59 it's a piece of paper that represents an
26:01 asset in some vault somewhere that's the
26:03 theory of it anyway right now we don't
26:05 have any real assets the idea was that
26:09 when they formed the Federal Reserve
26:10 after the 16th amendment was falsely
26:12 ratified usually when you start a
26:15 business and you want to have like a
26:17 hundred shares in a business you either
26:20 issue it all for free and then give it
26:22 to your partners in whatever ratio they
26:24 deserve or you value it at a dollar bill
26:28 and everyone has to put in a dollar for
26:31 every share that they get so hundred
26:33 shares requires a hundred dollars you
26:35 have to buy your share
26:38 well out of all the shares that the
26:41 Federal Reserve created for this private
26:42 for-profit bank only the United States
26:45 who's a 10% partner put all of its gold
26:49 and assets into this organization and
26:53 got it shares its 10% shares the other
26:56 90% of the shares which should be
26:58 purchased or backed by assets of these
27:00 European oligarchy families they simply
27:04 took the printing press ink and paper
27:07 printed the crappy currency you have in
27:10 your wallet and submitted it as their 90
27:12 percent payment for their shares I mean
27:18 the [ __ ] is unbelievable the fact
27:20 that we had senators that continued to
27:23 not say anything the people couldn't
27:25 figure it out
27:26 it was just astonishing I don't know how
27:28 it happened but back in the day when
27:31 someone would go to the Rothschilds back
27:33 in the seventeen hundreds and say I've
27:34 got a thousand dollars worth of gold and
27:37 they give him $1,000 worth of little
27:40 pieces of paper to vouch for that gold
27:43 and if anybody wanted to get the gold
27:44 they'd come back to the they take this
27:45 note which has got your name on it they
27:48 take it to the Rothschilds and say I'd
27:49 like to pick up $100 of their gold
27:51 because they gave me the certificate for
27:52 some services or products that I gave
27:54 them and they're like fine they go back
27:55 to the vault
27:56 they pull $100 with the gold put an
27:58 ingot underneath the window take the
28:00 certificate out of circulation mark it
28:02 in the ledger down 100 bucks what they
28:06 realized was nobody was coming back for
28:08 the gold they were just operating out
28:10 there in the world with these paper
28:12 certificates representations of things
28:14 that were in vaults and so they realized
28:17 Jesus you know what I could do there's a
28:19 law of averages is that only a tenth of
28:22 the people come back and get their stuff
28:24 so I can loan out ninety percent more of
28:27 this paper then the actual gold I have
28:32 in the vault and that's what the Federal
28:34 Reserve learned or that members of the
28:36 Federal Reserve all had individually
28:38 learned a hundred years earlier and so
28:40 when they created the Federal Reserve
28:42 which made the banking rules okay any
28:47 bank is certified to operate in United
28:49 States of America if they had one
28:51 dollar of gold in the bank they could
28:54 loan out nine dollars because only 10%
28:57 of the people come back now have you
29:02 ever heard of anybody taking a dollar
29:04 bill note and going getting $1 worth of
29:06 gold it doesn't work like that anymore
29:08 does it so now it's all fake money it's
29:12 completely fake so if a bank moves in
29:15 and puts in a million dollars that can
29:18 immediately loan nine million dollars
29:21 well now wait a minute what's a loan
29:23 when you go to get a loan how does that
29:25 work you want to start a business you
29:29 want $20,000 to start a business it's a
29:32 small business you go to the bank and
29:35 you try to borrow 20,000 and they say
29:37 well we need collateral what's that oh
29:41 that's you have to give us the right to
29:45 seize assets in your side of the fence
29:48 that are worth the $20,000 we're gonna
29:51 loan you so if you go tits-up on this
29:53 loan you don't pay it back we get to
29:56 come take your stuff and so usually
29:59 people sign up their homes their cars
30:03 cars don't really translate too much
30:06 because they lose so much value jewelry
30:08 assets gold stocks whatever the whatever
30:13 the bank will accept is collateral once
30:16 you've got up to 20,000 or close to it
30:20 they give you the loan but now here's
30:24 the rub when you get something like a
30:26 home loan it's much different right
30:29 because a home loan they know you don't
30:31 have $500,000 if you're in California
30:35 get an average house where I live for
30:37 500 grand but you know you don't have
30:39 $500,000 in assets that can be seized so
30:43 they're taking a risk and they're saying
30:45 okay we'll give you the 500 grand which
30:48 then you will give to the person who
30:49 owns the house so that you can move in
30:52 the house and you sign up for a 10 20 30
30:54 year loan depending how big your
30:56 paycheck is to pay us back well now
31:01 technically speaking they have created
31:03 $500,000 in cash probably
31:05 numbers in a computer and they're
31:06 transferring those numbers to another
31:08 computer and some other person's bank
31:09 account
31:10 might even be the same bank but they're
31:13 telling the person that they're giving
31:14 the money to is that they actually have
31:15 assets in their own possession to back
31:18 up that loan now
31:20 one house for one big giant bank like
31:23 Chase Manhattan sure they've got plenty
31:25 of money to back up one house half a
31:28 million dollars jeez
31:29 well those guys walk around with that in
31:31 their pockets right but if you took all
31:34 the loans that a single bank has loaned
31:37 out they don't have the money to back up
31:40 all the loans and they rely on
31:43 fractional reserve banking as a legal
31:45 mechanism for loaning out money it's not
31:47 illegal it's uncynical but it's not
31:49 illegal to loan money up so chances are
31:54 if you have bought a house and the
31:57 economy got bad and your bank comes to
32:00 foreclose on your house you are a part
32:04 of a ruse they're saying well this house
32:08 is ours and you haven't paid it off so
32:11 we're gonna subtract this and that and
32:12 you're gonna you're gonna get a short
32:14 sale on it or what have you but if you
32:17 took him to court and said prove that
32:19 you have the money to back up that loan
32:22 for every single loan that you've ever
32:24 given out the hard assets to back up
32:27 this virtual currency that you
32:29 transferred from one bank account digit
32:31 in a database to another bank account
32:33 digit in another database they couldn't
32:35 prove it and there was a guy that
32:37 actually did this somewhere in the
32:38 Midwest and he he had a house worth
32:40 thirty five thousand think he did this
32:42 in the 70s but he can still do in the
32:46 80s of course but he won in court he
32:48 said the bank the local bank didn't have
32:50 the real money to back up his house when
32:52 compared to all the other loans that
32:53 they had given out so instead of risking
32:56 that story going to press they just
32:59 walked away
33:00 he got the house for free well he had
33:02 paid the he had paid off the house he
33:04 just hadn't paid off all the interest
33:07 you have to understand the history of
33:09 the Federal Reserve and its [ __ ] to
33:13 understand what the Federal Reserve
33:15 collapsing means to you and
33:18 your country of America right now there
33:26 has been a change in America as of 2016
33:29 a president with an amazing pedigree in
33:35 economics went to the best economic
33:37 school in the United States of America
33:39 and graduated very high in his class he
33:42 turned a few million bucks into a ten
33:44 billion dollar empire there's now the
33:48 President of the United States and so
33:49 when now for the very first time for the
33:52 first time in the history of this
33:54 country since it formed and started
33:56 taking on presidents such as you know
34:00 George Washington apparently they were
34:01 like 7 to 11 presidents before him
34:05 including an African gentleman but since
34:10 then we haven't we haven't had ever in
34:12 history an economic president someone
34:18 understands the economy someone
34:19 understands money someone has had in
34:20 negotiate someone who's done it a bunch
34:22 of times been extremely successful at it
34:24 sure he's got you know he hasn't
34:27 personally gone bankrupt but
34:28 institutions he's worked have gone
34:29 bankrupt bankrupt the key said 76
34:32 corporations in his lifetime I think for
34:34 went tits-up any of you who've ever
34:37 started a corporation know that that is
34:40 unbelievably successful record okay so
34:45 they don't like him Europe doesn't like
34:47 him all the globalists hate Trump
34:49 because he's bringing it back
34:51 nationalism as I just did an episode on
34:54 he's bringing back sovereignty and he's
34:57 trying to follow the letter of the law
34:59 in the Constitution of the United States
35:03 well what are his opposing forces well
35:06 your leftists progressives your
35:09 right-wing sellouts are all against him
35:12 but the beautiful thing is they're all
35:14 criminals they have committed such
35:17 crimes that they could all be executed
35:21 under sedition and treason charges I
35:24 don't mean all of them but a lot of them
35:26 a lot of the ones in power and he has
35:28 him hopefully dead to rights
35:30 according to cute
35:31 Whittaker is gonna have some fun
35:33 hopefully make a lot of episodes about
35:35 the aftermath of this whole thing so
35:40 they can cock-block all of his laws use
35:43 these Ninth Circuit Judges to literally
35:46 violate the sanctity of this country
35:48 they'll all lose in the end
35:50 so how do they stop him how do they stop
35:54 him and what does he want to do
35:55 ultimately well they could try to kill
35:59 him and supposedly they have again as I
36:01 mentioned in previous episodes they can
36:06 try to get him and peached right the
36:07 house can impeach a president for
36:10 absolutely no reason whatsoever but the
36:12 Senate has to ratify that two-thirds
36:14 majority and that'll never happen ever
36:16 so it's a complete waste of your
36:19 taxpayer dollars for those of you who
36:22 want to hug social programs you're you
36:24 know a leftist the impeachment process
36:26 would waste tens of millions of dollars
36:30 just like this phony [ __ ] Mueller
36:32 Russian collusion story it's wasting
36:36 it's already wasted I think twelve
36:39 million euros every single month those
36:43 could be paid out paying off student
36:44 loans funding the arts whatever complete
36:47 waste of time
36:49 but one of the most controlling
36:53 apparatus is the Federal Reserve Bank
36:58 they control the interest by which money
37:01 is loaned now I've said in the past I
37:07 have a family member of mine that have
37:08 worked that has worked now retired for
37:11 the Federal Reserve for 20 years for the
37:14 first 10 I was asleep for the second 10
37:17 I was wide awake going oh my god now
37:20 this individual doesn't know anything
37:22 about the bank and it's devious nature
37:26 doesn't want to believe it in the first
37:27 place so sort of a we went to the moon
37:30 kind of mentality but I want you guys to
37:32 know that what that's allowed me to do
37:35 is data mine
37:36 the average intellect of someone who
37:38 works for the bank now get this get this
37:45 works for the Federal Reserve for 20
37:47 years I think even more net when I
37:49 mentioned fractional reserve banking
37:51 this person said I don't even know what
37:54 that is
37:55 this person teaches economics and in
37:57 colleges mm-hmm
38:00 doesn't know what fractional reserve
38:01 banking is and then went away came back
38:04 and said oh let's not even called that
38:06 it doesn't work that way anyway now how
38:10 many tens of thousands of videos on
38:11 YouTube bye-bye economic professors have
38:15 talked about fractional reserve banking
38:17 and no one has refuted them no one has
38:20 said this doesn't exist I'm gonna debunk
38:22 this whole concept there's thousands of
38:26 videos talking about fractional reserve
38:28 banking yet I've seen your employee at
38:31 that organization doesn't know it exists
38:34 talk about [ __ ] compartmentalization
38:37 right talk about pre censorship as Rod
38:39 Serling said 1959 we need to hire people
38:43 that don't know this exists that that
38:46 are that are just bound to never learn
38:49 it like they they have cancer and you
38:51 push the cure to cancer over in a little
38:53 tiny slip of paper and says just one
38:55 ingredient just take that one ingredient
38:56 you'll cure your cancer and they push it
38:58 back because you're like I don't want
38:59 your stuff I'm gonna die and get all my
39:03 sympathy right hmm okay but what the
39:11 Federal Reserve does is they loan banks
39:14 money in the middle of the night with
39:18 usually like 24 hour to 48-hour terms on
39:23 the money it's a lot of money and
39:25 there's some times they loan it to each
39:27 other at almost no interest and then
39:30 they charge you interest for it now
39:32 they're starting to raise the interest
39:33 rates right that interest rates are
39:36 interesting because what that allows you
39:38 to do is get more interest in your bank
39:39 account technically now banks unlike
39:42 when I was a kid you'd put money in a
39:44 savings account and it would accrue
39:45 interest now it is a [ __ ] joke
39:48 they've taken it all away right just
39:51 like video game companies that that
39:53 create great games when they start
39:55 because they profit share with their
39:57 with their employees right
39:59 our entertainment just recently
40:00 completely squashed this ei when I first
40:03 joined 1993 they were profit sharing
40:06 with the departments make a great game
40:09 get a big paycheck at the end of the
40:11 year
40:11 well eventually they just they make it a
40:13 group and make an individual department
40:16 bonus then they make it a group bonus
40:17 with the entire company then they just
40:18 get rid of it
40:19 Blizzard just got rid of theirs and
40:21 that's why their company sucks now right
40:23 too bad they could change of course and
40:27 this will be recorded in time as of 2018
40:31 winter the CEOs quit they've lost the 15
40:35 million monthly subscribers that's what
40:39 happens right I digress so the Federal
40:44 Reserve is now trying to threaten Donald
40:47 Trump will screw up your economy he's
40:50 they say to him he's been asked about it
40:53 a couple times Donald Trump's entire
40:58 mechanism and methodology for his
41:02 adversaries is one to throw them a
41:07 branch throw them an olive branch and
41:09 say okay I'm not gonna badmouth you in
41:11 front of everyone because maybe when we
41:13 sit down and talk behind closed doors
41:16 non-transcribed conversations you will
41:19 get to a point where we can work out a
41:22 deal they may have worked out a deal
41:26 hell maybe they only talk in interviews
41:29 right he takes an interview says a
41:30 little bit someone over in Europe takes
41:32 and interviews those a little bit and
41:33 they communicate through interviews it
41:35 could happen like that they never
41:36 actually sit down but now there's this
41:41 rumor that we are going to go into a
41:44 collapse and again I made an episode
41:45 what three years ago about this economic
41:47 collapse [ __ ] all these [ __ ]
41:50 conspiracy channels peddling gold and
41:53 silver instead of just selling gold and
41:55 silver as a great mechanism to invest
41:57 protect yourself which is smart they
41:59 threatened you with financial collapse
42:01 was x22 webchannel his [ __ ] logo is a
42:06 stock market symbol going down I mean
42:08 he's literally praying that the economy
42:12 crashes
42:12 when this bad news comes around if it
42:14 ever does that guy's gonna be
42:15 high-fiving himself right do you really
42:18 want to get your information from
42:19 someone like that aren't you always
42:22 concerned about ulterior motives aren't
42:24 you concerned about shills anyone
42:26 peddling economic collapse to push it on
42:29 you for their sponsorship to a channel
42:32 telling you I will never take that that
42:35 type of sponsor if I ever peddle gold
42:37 and silver selling it will simply be
42:39 because it's a good idea not because
42:42 it's a threat against your existence
42:44 right well they're talking about this
42:47 huge collapse but what would fuel such a
42:50 thing well companies typically need
42:53 loans they need loans to expand they
42:57 need loans to bridge between seasons
43:00 right almost every company has it
43:03 offseason
43:04 right even if you made cold and flu
43:07 medicine and you made billions and
43:09 trillions of dollars every time that you
43:10 know the [ __ ] sprays in the sky we all
43:12 get sick you're still have a season
43:14 between October and May and summertime
43:16 everyone's healthy getting some Sun
43:18 photons feeding their body what it's
43:19 made out of so sometimes they'll take
43:22 bridge loans bridge loans are enough
43:24 money to pay off June July August maybe
43:28 September's payroll just in case that
43:30 gets lien you got some protection but
43:32 when you start making on your profit
43:33 again boom you pay back the loan and
43:35 you're okay well if they start to mess
43:39 with the interest rates by which people
43:41 could borrow that money then those loans
43:45 that were typically affordable to bridge
43:47 between a and B are now gonna be so
43:49 expensive to pay off at the end of the
43:51 term you don't borrow the money because
43:54 it would just put you under and so you
43:57 go to business intentionally to protect
44:00 yourself but there's more factors than
44:03 that with this particular collapse isn't
44:04 there we have a bunch of coms that are
44:07 extremely overvalued the profits don't
44:11 match at all their value now these
44:16 organizations could go out of business
44:18 organically and these businesses could
44:21 be tanked intentionally
44:25 take facebook I will tell you right now
44:29 that if we could have a little moment of
44:31 truth like a little god meter that would
44:34 answer a question either true or false
44:37 I'm willing to submit that 1/3 to 50% of
44:44 every registered Facebook user is a fake
44:47 account I'm willing to bet that at least
44:50 50% of those fake accounts are not
44:52 Russian BOTS
44:52 they are Facebook bots that create fake
44:55 accounts and so that when you buy
44:57 advertising on Facebook you could prove
44:59 this in a court of law now they could
45:02 quickly change things to get around this
45:06 ok but if you buy advertising for one of
45:10 your pages on YouTube you create a page
45:12 and you buy advertising 50 bucks or
45:14 whatever to drive people to subscribe to
45:17 your page to like your page you will
45:19 have hundreds and hundreds of likes but
45:21 the second you post anything and look at
45:23 your insights meaning how many people
45:24 looked at that post it'll be like 5 10
45:27 people because those people are fake and
45:31 I had this experience with our MKULTRA
45:34 radio page we were buying advertising
45:37 and then we got all these subscribers we
45:39 had 650 subscribers within a month and a
45:41 half I'd post something and only 10
45:43 people would look at it and I know I was
45:45 one my co-host was the other and our
45:47 friends and family are the other eight
45:49 people now what are the odds that you
45:51 immediately like or that you like a page
45:53 excuse me on a Monday I post something
45:56 Monday night and you don't look at it
45:59 it's something you're excited about you
46:01 like the page and you never come back to
46:03 look at it it's proof that Facebook is
46:06 largely inflated and it's numbers but
46:12 now is there a law that says you can't
46:13 do that no but is there a crime and
46:17 taking someone's money and faking
46:19 results that could be contested in a
46:21 court of law
46:23 now we know organizations exist overseas
46:26 in China that will like your page a
46:29 bunch that will give you a bunch of subs
46:30 on YouTube that will fake reviews and
46:33 iTunes on your app you know your app or
46:35 your Google Player whatever those
46:37 exist right so we have a bunch of
46:40 companies that are valued over a billion
46:42 dollars we have a bunch of companies
46:44 that are approaching one trillion-dollar
46:46 market caps absolutely absurd values
46:50 what Google stock I think I looked at it
46:53 yesterday it was a thousand forty three
46:55 dollars for a single share why would a
46:58 company keep a share one share over a
47:00 thousand dollars because they don't want
47:03 you to buy it because it's a alphabet
47:05 agency it's it's holding companies
47:08 called alphabet Inc oh wow amazing right
47:12 in your [ __ ] face right don't be evil
47:15 right Eric Schmidt resigned the within
47:19 three days of Trump signing the
47:21 executive order that says if you're
47:23 caught in trial trafficking or human
47:24 trafficking we're gonna seize all your
47:26 assets and you will go away forever he
47:30 resigns immediately hmm rumor has it
47:33 that his little jet-setting around the
47:35 world was full of a bunch of teenage
47:37 girls I don't know if that's true that's
47:39 what I heard
47:40 seems odd that guys on top of the world
47:43 and now he does this to her and take
47:45 shits on whoo oh the guy that is in part
47:48 of the club right and all the previous
47:51 presidents between Kennedy and Trump and
47:54 Kennedy back to probably Taft were in on
47:58 the payroll either through the very
48:03 incidental thing of Woodrow Wilson and
48:06 his handler Colonel moon or they were
48:10 just simply in on it so I'm seeing
48:13 article headlines like the Great
48:17 Depression of America which is about 36
48:20 percent unemployment right which would
48:22 be it's it's monstrous unemployment you
48:25 are in a soup line to get your food that
48:27 that'll be a just a mere bump in history
48:30 compared to the economic collapse that's
48:33 coming you need to understand that the
48:36 President of the United States is well
48:38 aware of all of the circumstances
48:39 surrounding what it means to collapse
48:42 the Fed it was asked to q and on is the
48:46 Federal Reserve gonna be shut down his
48:49 response was
48:50 reorganised hmm now I have an episode
48:54 way back when about replacing our money
48:58 if that's interesting to you go take a
49:00 look at it we're going to just briefly
49:03 highlight some of the concepts from that
49:07 episode but I go into great detail and
49:09 you're gonna hear some of the analogies
49:10 given in this episode repeated in that
49:12 one but again there's a lot of extra
49:14 information over there so let's say that
49:17 the Federal Reserve collapses for
49:21 whatever means they try to raise
49:25 interest rates so high that no one can
49:27 loan money anyone it starts to affect
49:28 the businesses businesses start
49:30 trickling down what the Federal Reserve
49:33 and the bankers of Europe tried to do
49:35 and again the Federal Reserve is sort of
49:37 a tiny little proxy into the problem it
49:42 creating our money is the dumbest thing
49:44 on planet earth and again you'll have
49:46 people cite the fact that the mints are
49:48 actually owned by the United States of
49:49 America all the paper and ink is our
49:51 property but again we're making it on
49:53 behalf of this other entity imagine you
49:57 know you're a carpenter and you make
49:59 tables but every table that you make you
50:03 spend all your resources to make it but
50:05 then immediately it's your neighbor's
50:07 property and they use it to do business
50:10 with and you never get to make any
50:12 profit off of it that's sort of as
50:14 insane as our money is right now but we
50:18 have a national debt don't we isn't that
50:22 a big problem for the United States of
50:24 America and Europe in general hmm let's
50:27 think about that if I took an illegal
50:30 loan from a loan shark some real bad
50:33 individual and then I couldn't pay it
50:37 back or I refused to pay it back and
50:40 he's coming for me right he sends his
50:42 thugs after me and that doesn't work I
50:47 get rid of them and so his only option
50:50 is to come after me personally and
50:51 usually loan sharks pretty badass guys
50:52 personally that's how they got the whole
50:55 game started now I'm in a parking lot
50:56 and the guy descends on me in a parking
50:59 lot
51:00 he's got a gun and I managed to somehow
51:03 survive that situation the police arrive
51:05 and they arrest him because he has a gun
51:09 they check to see if I'm okay they take
51:13 me down and book me or whatever just to
51:14 see you know who I am and all that kind
51:15 of stuff and they released me because
51:17 they realized I'm the good guy and they
51:21 know I've taken a loan from this dude
51:22 they're like well you're a dumbass but
51:25 you know it's not it's between you and
51:26 him it's like really a personal loan
51:28 it's just got a lot of penalties right
51:30 your kneecaps does the law come in and
51:37 say you have to pay this loan shark back
51:40 [ __ ] no they just go well good luck man
51:45 hopefully he stays in prison long enough
51:46 or doesn't know someone on the outside
51:47 that'll [ __ ] you up you might consider
51:49 moving changing your identity cut off
51:51 that hair well that's our relationship
51:54 with our national debt we have taken
51:59 money and not not every single penny
52:00 okay we have legitimate countries like
52:03 China who have loaned us money I think
52:05 without interest problems like the
52:08 Federal Reserve creating our money
52:09 without interest being created but the
52:14 main multi trillion dollar debt that we
52:18 have is to the equivalency of a
52:22 corporate loan shark it's technically an
52:25 illegal loan so all the interests that
52:28 we owe the Federal Reserve and his
52:33 partner members is illegal so if we had
52:37 say 21 trillion dollars in debt in the
52:39 United States how much of that goes to
52:41 China let's say 1.5 trillion but the
52:45 rest is all [ __ ] well [ __ ] me we
52:47 could pay off 1.5 trillion and no time
52:49 flat trust me
52:51 the Pentagon loses trillions every year
52:53 right we paid 7 trillion just to fight
52:57 our ridiculous war overseas right but no
53:00 benefit to us whatsoever so where does
53:03 all this debt come from it comes from
53:06 decades and decades of the Doctrine
53:09 ation as citizens of the United States
53:12 believing that the money creation system
53:15 in this country is legit and that it's
53:17 fair and they could possibly ever be
53:19 paid back well it can't so let's review
53:25 that collapse again the collapse of the
53:27 Federal Reserve
53:28 well if I were Trump one I would educate
53:35 through tweets and through podium
53:37 sessions and maybe even Oval Office
53:40 speeches to the American people probably
53:43 one everyday or one every week for quite
53:45 a while educating the people on the
53:48 economics of creating money showing them
53:52 that we could do what Lincoln did back
53:54 in the Civil War and create our own
53:56 money called the greenback backed by our
54:00 gold backed by our assets when we do
54:03 trade with other countries for
54:04 legitimate products and tax that that
54:07 taxation could be what funds our own
54:10 money there's a million ways to value
54:12 money but the first thing is that we
54:18 don't need to panic at all what's the
54:20 idea we can't get a hold of money how
54:23 did the 1929 crash happen they rescind
54:25 it out of circulation 3/4 of the money
54:28 in the knighted States of America
54:29 roughly that would never happen if we
54:34 controlled that paper how many of you
54:37 have studied Bitcoin and what's the big
54:41 sales pitch a Bitcoin again bitcoins an
54:44 actual brand of coin brand of Bitcoin
54:46 and Bitcoin is what we call all digital
54:48 currency that uses the blockchain right
54:53 every single division of Bitcoin has a
54:57 limited amount a Bitcoin which then what
54:59 drives up its value now it's a bunch of
55:01 [ __ ] because they actually have
55:03 infinite fractions of a particular piece
55:06 of money so it really doesn't carry over
55:09 the promise like they say and spare me
55:12 your your hocus pocus economics to make
55:16 that a reality when you have printed
55:19 money and the smallest unit of money is
55:21 a dollar and then you limit the amount
55:23 of dollars that's real limitation
55:25 right but if you constantly say well you
55:27 could take this piece of paper and rip a
55:29 little piece off the dollar now you have
55:30 you know a Penny's worth of a dollar
55:32 that's a [ __ ] model okay there would
55:36 definitely be some panic because we're
55:39 uneducated as a as a whole nation on
55:42 this situation but if any of you have
55:45 been truthers and you've tried to pass
55:47 on the truth of the Federal Reserve and
55:48 the IRS in the sixteenth amendment how
55:50 this all happened you now will become
55:54 the priests of this country and that you
55:58 will give counseling to people almost
56:01 like confession reassuring them that
56:04 everything's gonna be okay
56:06 don't sell off all your stuff don't even
56:09 move right it's almost like freeze there
56:12 is a predator in the room that could
56:14 only see you if you move right it's one
56:17 of those kind of situations what happens
56:20 is the mint gets a new plate right we
56:25 might be able to keep the look of a
56:27 dollar bill take the [ __ ] pyramid off
56:29 the back take all that goddamn
56:30 Illuminati [ __ ] out of there
56:31 take the al out of the corner all that
56:33 crap we have a new plate for the front
56:36 in the back of every single bill that we
56:38 sell here know that we put into
56:40 circulation excuse me
56:42 and then we change it to say property of
56:45 the United States of America and set a
56:47 Federal Reserve Note legal tender baby
56:50 instead of having the green seal as a
56:53 red seal so this is real legal tender
56:56 sovereign to our country owned by no one
56:58 else but the citizens of this country as
57:01 a group corporation and then there's the
57:04 exchange the big exchange it takes maybe
57:09 a decade but ninety five percent of the
57:11 money is turned in okay or confiscated
57:15 from banks and replaced with this new
57:17 currency backed by who us the United
57:21 States of America and so let's say we
57:25 have a million units of money in
57:27 circulation it's way more than that but
57:28 let's just say we have a million units
57:30 of infer
57:31 printed currency so 95 percent is
57:34 replaced and then over the next decade
57:37 grandpa's you know finds a box
57:39 fines a dollar in a book or whatever
57:40 some people are just collecting this
57:42 [ __ ] so it never gets turned in it
57:44 becomes illegal to use as legal tender
57:48 let's say a year after are ten years
57:49 after this moment right
57:52 but instantaneously we have money all
57:55 the digital currency in banks well it
57:57 just is considered all of a sudden
58:00 digital currency of this new federal or
58:03 of this new federal actual note right
58:05 truly federal not a private for-profit
58:08 bank right but a one-to-one translation
58:12 in my opinion if you go see my replacing
58:16 economy I'm gonna do a little brief on
58:18 that right little cliff notes on this at
58:22 this point I don't think that's enough
58:25 we have inflated our currency so much
58:28 it's ridiculous what does that mean for
58:32 those of you who are like I've heard
58:33 that word but not quite sure how he's
58:34 using it what context he's using it in
58:37 well the house back when I was a kid in
58:40 the 70s would cost anywhere from ten
58:43 thousand dollars to about thirty five
58:45 thousand dollars I think their house
58:46 next door that I stare at the entire
58:48 time I make this show sold in this 60s
58:50 early 60s for 35 35 36 thousand dollars
58:56 it's probably worth 700 grand now the
59:01 reason why it's worth 700 grand is that
59:03 the buying power of your money has
59:05 reduced considerably now you still make
59:09 more money so everybody's always worried
59:12 about inflation it's like yeah okay if
59:14 inflation happens and you know a gallon
59:17 of milk costs you know five bucks
59:19 instead of 250 and then a you know might
59:23 be goes to ten after that you're making
59:25 more money so you used to make seventy
59:26 five thousand dollars a year and now
59:27 you're making a hundred thousand dollars
59:28 a year because your employer knows you
59:30 need just a base amount of income to
59:32 survive you won't even take the job
59:33 unless you can survive so the whole
59:35 thing goes up right and that's where
59:38 nobody worries about our national debt
59:40 because you owe trillion now but then we
59:44 dilute our money we inflate it and
59:47 everyone makes more and so again if you
59:51 for instance
59:53 this is not perfectly accurate but it'll
59:55 give you a little bit of a notion here
59:56 if that house goes $36,000 my car costs
60:01 more net right I could hold that note
60:04 until 2018 and then pay it off with 2018
60:07 money then that paying off that house is
60:10 a cinch it's a cinch right I think we
60:16 need to get to the point where we we
60:20 deflate our money we go maybe a tenth of
60:26 the currency that we have in circulation
60:30 now how do we do that if you had a
60:33 dollar bill in your hand the new one
60:35 that's completely sovereign and awesome
60:37 and I want to delete that down to it
60:39 done I can't just simply say the next
60:43 day you know that note you have in your
60:45 hand it's now worth 10 times the amount
60:49 I can't do that because then a whole it
60:51 just reverses the the problem over the
60:54 course of 20 years I think within the
60:57 first 10 I think you could aggressively
60:58 deal with in five if you really wanted
61:00 to we print a new currency
61:03 maybe maybe Americans can get some
61:05 [ __ ] color in their currency right
61:07 maybe at first it's only paper currency
61:09 then you can invent new coins because
61:12 coins themselves would be completely
61:16 tampered with in terms of their value
61:18 you can we know that copper pennies
61:20 aren't copper they've got the zinc in
61:21 the middle and all this other crap you
61:23 look at any type of other than nickel
61:25 and it goes the only one that's pure
61:26 right but all the other coins have
61:28 filler in them now they're not pure
61:30 silver quarters anymore we can go back
61:34 to that type of currency and then truly
61:35 have value in our pockets you could go
61:38 on that date for 35 cents like my
61:40 grandparents did right why do that why
61:44 mess with the money why deflate well one
61:47 it counteracts the very formula of
61:50 dealing with foreign currencies imagine
61:54 we deflated to to one tenth of the
61:58 currency meaning everything is worth 10
62:00 times as much in this new currency we go
62:03 to Europe
62:05 Jesus you plot an American dollar boom
62:08 it's worth 10 times their their
62:10 single-unit fiat currency and boy they
62:13 would want our money like you can't
62:15 believe man the world will go on to an
62:18 American currency simply because it's
62:20 valuable if they weren't able to copy us
62:22 right but it also gates corruption how
62:29 many of you've heard of those schemes
62:30 where someone takes a fraction of a
62:32 transaction and puts it in a secret bank
62:35 account right this happened a lot in the
62:36 70s with hackers who are making Bank
62:40 programs and they'd siphon it off it's
62:42 the it's the plot and office space it's
62:44 the plot I think in Superman 3 with
62:46 Richard Pryor 2 or 3 where he was the
62:49 hacker that was siphoning off money
62:50 that's possible because of inflation the
62:55 it's really funny the the toll or the
62:57 the bill you pay when you drive in them
62:59 carpooling in California is three
63:01 hundred and forty one dollars and I'd
63:03 look at that forty one dollars I think
63:05 somebody's putting out in a weird bank
63:07 account off offshore right it just has
63:09 that feeling of like why not three
63:11 hundred and forty dollars why not three
63:13 hundred fifty bucks just round the
63:14 [ __ ] thing up right 341 really weird
63:17 well now if you deflate the economy by
63:22 at least a tenth okay or to a tenth of
63:27 what it is today and someone tries to
63:29 insert a single penny of penalty
63:32 well that penny is now worth ten times
63:35 as much it's worth a dime right how many
63:39 of you love your cell phone bills with
63:42 all the 9/11 tax on it right all these
63:45 utilities with all these taxes you'd
63:48 notice it if someone put a little bit
63:51 more in there I think that's important
63:55 not mandatory but I think it would
63:58 further differentiate our income I mean
64:01 our money from the rest of the world I
64:04 think that's important how does the
64:08 Federal Reserve have power in the first
64:09 place it's all in your head just like
64:14 the national debt is all in your head
64:16 there's a lot of people who talk about
64:18 the national debt is this big trump card
64:21 in the conversation that somehow they're
64:23 really involved with the world right
64:25 they're worshiping their indoctrination
64:28 they're trying to have status in a
64:30 conversation by dropping a big mad fact
64:33 on everybody well you know the the
64:35 national debt 21 trillion in Trump's
64:37 just making that go up like crazy hey
64:43 trillions of dollars are spent on every
64:45 president's watch but when the previous
64:47 I don't know 60 years of presidencies
64:51 has completely screwed up this country
64:54 and the one that comes in is not part of
64:56 the Bohemian Grove it's not part of the
64:59 Bilderberg Group comes in and goes Jesus
65:02 Christ I got to fix this [ __ ] mess on
65:04 my watch
65:05 yeah he's gonna have to spend trillions
65:08 of dollars to fix our military to
65:10 protect our borders to rebuild our
65:13 highways our airports everything our
65:18 bridges a railroad system we have a
65:22 tremendous amount of atrophy in this
65:24 country because everyone's been ignoring
65:25 it all the Senators erase all this pork
65:27 belly spending for their state it all
65:30 goes in the pockets of these [ __ ]
65:32 contractors and other politicians it
65:35 buys you know summer homes and vacations
65:37 it doesn't buy your highway right but
65:41 again because we're so inflated if
65:42 someone inserts ten thousand dollars
65:44 into their bank account and they're
65:45 making 250 grand a year being a state
65:48 senator or whatever you barely notice
65:50 that oh if they put $10,000 into their
65:54 account and it's deflated by 90%
65:57 now you're gonna notice I mentioned
66:02 bug's life several times on this show
66:04 earlier and it's it's incarnation I
66:07 think Dave one of our Facebook listeners
66:11 who post a lot of great stuff on the
66:13 page he reposted the clip from Bug's
66:18 Life where the grasshoppers are talking
66:21 to the lead grasshoppers talking to
66:22 their grasshoppers if you haven't seen
66:24 this movie it's basically this there's
66:26 millions and millions of ants that live
66:28 in the world and they're run by some big
66:31 tough
66:32 grasshoppers whoo number I think in like
66:33 eight to ten but because the ants have
66:37 subscribed to the idea that these
66:41 grasshoppers are all-powerful
66:43 the cowbird down to them and how did the
66:46 ants win at the end of the movie oh they
66:48 changed the paradigm of thinking they
66:50 get rid of the slave mind that they have
66:52 and they kick the [ __ ] out these
66:54 grasshoppers you've seen this arc in a
66:56 thousand movies even like one of my
66:57 favorite movies three amigos
66:59 right the Mexican village fights a
67:02 waffle who's got like 20 guys on
67:04 horseback with guns and they fight back
67:07 and and beat them right know the Federal
67:11 Reserve can do a couple things because
67:12 they are owned by these these families
67:14 overseas one they can create the need to
67:19 replace them and that creates utter
67:21 chaos in America for areas probably I
67:24 don't know one or two years I think very
67:28 quickly once we replace their currency
67:30 with our own sovereign currency people
67:32 are gonna feel good really well I mean
67:33 really quickly and and the the president
67:36 just needs to go on TV and say okay
67:38 here's the deal
67:39 cut your reserves out new ones in all of
67:43 your money will be replaced for now keep
67:44 using their crappy currency it's still
67:47 legal tinder but on this particular day
67:51 90 days from this moment of me talking
67:54 you'll be able to go to any of your
67:56 local banks and translate your money
67:58 into the new money but for the next year
68:02 both both currencies are interchangeable
68:06 but the actual interest payments and
68:10 national debt related to that money is
68:13 no longer happening so even though
68:16 you're using those old notes it has no
68:19 association with Europe anymore they are
68:21 done the Grasshoppers have been kicked
68:23 in the balls and it's over okay
68:27 well they're the they're owned again by
68:29 these really powerful monarchy families
68:32 all over Europe these banker families
68:34 all over Europe and the world and
68:35 there's a bunch of people in it all over
68:37 the place right we're pretty sure that
68:40 Russia and China are out of the game of
68:42 using that currency but I think China is
68:44 kidding itself
68:46 unless they've done some cooing of their
68:48 own
68:50 I believe the numbers like 49 Banks and
68:52 China are owned by the Rothschilds with
68:54 Chinese names so they're gonna have to
68:56 clean house over there as well and I'm
68:57 sure they would very quickly so between
69:00 China Russia and United States wow we
69:02 got trade we're going great
69:04 you don't think other countries are
69:05 gonna fall follow really quickly oh yeah
69:08 they're gonna follow really quickly we
69:10 might even have some sort of rescue plan
69:12 for countries to do it those families
69:16 can only cause problems if people buy
69:19 into them well how many times in your
69:23 life have you seen someone pull a scam
69:25 and or even heard of such a thing right
69:28 they pull the scam and there's a bunch
69:29 of people in on it and then the scam
69:31 gets exposed and all the taggers on who
69:34 were siphoning money off the scam boy
69:36 they just vanish it just disappear right
69:39 I bet Kevin Spacey's dinner parties are
69:43 pretty sparse these days right
69:45 that's what happens so the other
69:49 retaliation there's a bunch of different
69:51 forms of retaliation some could be
69:54 really severe and we're gonna go through
69:55 those before it's over they could take
69:58 every corporation that they control
70:00 outside of the United States of America
70:02 and maybe even some inside but I think
70:03 the laws would be passed very quickly
70:04 executive orders we pass very quickly
70:06 that you can no longer do business with
70:08 these organizations and yes some
70:10 gigantic investment baking houses would
70:12 probably go tits up fairly quickly
70:15 stocks well they'd probably be suspended
70:17 for a while you wouldn't know exactly
70:20 what your stock portfolio was worth and
70:23 that's why these guys scared you into
70:24 gold and silver again just get into
70:26 going silver because it's a good idea it
70:28 never goes up and down in value the
70:31 money by which you value it it goes up
70:33 and down in money so gold is never a
70:34 ounce of gold is always worth an ounce
70:36 of gold okay how many dollar bills it
70:39 takes to buy it or Euros or whatever
70:41 that's what changes so if the price of
70:44 gold goes up that means the value of
70:45 your dollars gone down if the price of
70:47 gold goes down that means your value
70:49 went up so you're safe either way right
70:52 now the cool thing is if we deflated you
70:56 might be able to get down to $35
70:59 bounces of gold like it used to be
71:00 forever never wavered because our money
71:03 had a fixed value but yeah they could
71:06 cause a lot of issues but now as Trump
71:09 is reminded most people worth a big
71:11 piggy bank over here we have every
71:14 strategic resource on our continent that
71:16 we need to exist on this planet we don't
71:18 need to beg borrow from anywhere we have
71:21 gold we have coal we have gasoline we
71:25 have everything okay again we've already
71:29 developed enough plutonium to blow up
71:31 the entire world 50 times over so we
71:33 don't need any more uranium from
71:34 anywhere we have steel everything so we
71:40 could become complete xenophobes we
71:42 won't but we could be and then this
71:45 place becomes a goddamn utopia protected
71:48 by an army that is fully capable of
71:51 fending off any aggressor instead of
71:54 having the brightest people in the world
71:55 and all of our ideas being stolen and
71:58 made by copycats it doesn't go anywhere
72:04 trade secrets stay here our partners
72:08 China and Russia yeah they're gonna have
72:10 to follow the rules if they want to do
72:13 trade with us which they will because
72:15 we're friends with both those
72:16 organizations even though every
72:18 Americans told that we're not friends
72:19 with those organizations those people
72:21 those nations it should be understood
72:26 that the plan to replace the Federal
72:29 Reserve is probably now close to two
72:31 years old
72:32 even just in the White House alone now
72:35 if the rumors of Trump's election has to
72:38 do with the anti coup of the military
72:41 and that is probably more like six years
72:44 old those plans but again people far
72:47 brighter than any of us have been
72:48 thinking about this for a really long
72:49 time and most likely will contribute to
72:52 the transformation and migration from
72:55 one economy to the other corporations
72:58 will go away that exists today one
73:01 because they have contributed to the
73:03 five eyes the spying organizations and
73:06 they'll simply be shut down because
73:07 their treasonous they slash sedition
73:10 based corporations
73:12 others will excel in value because they
73:15 never have been involved with any of
73:16 those things and they have a great
73:17 service the neighbor they were never
73:19 able to be the default search engine
73:21 they were never able to be the most
73:24 popular social media platform and they
73:27 will rise up to replace those
73:28 organizations there won't be any
73:30 censorship of any kind right kim.com is
73:32 bragging that he is coming up with a
73:34 total replacement for twitter instagram
73:37 and facebook if that will be an awesome
73:40 day when he comes up with that because
73:41 he says it's infinite uploads you can
73:44 upload movies of any size and they'll be
73:47 no censorship of any kind his launching
73:50 of that platform will change the entire
73:52 world period but now we all know that
73:57 these people are evil we know that they
74:02 do things to children that are beyond
74:05 evil they do it to get off and they do
74:08 it - we think stay young these people
74:13 are beyond despicable and I doubt that
74:16 any one of you I hope knows a single
74:19 person that's that acidic ly horrible so
74:23 what will they do what else will they do
74:25 what are they willing to do hmm probably
74:29 anything that they can get their hands
74:32 on they do have agents that work for
74:34 them probably outside of any of our
74:36 alphabet agencies and yeah they like to
74:41 see the world burn that's what they do a
74:42 lot of them just hate us to begin with
74:44 right one of the reasons why America has
74:47 been under siege and you need to
74:49 remember this is according to the
74:52 European monarchy they took their money
74:55 and they paid for the creation of this
74:58 country called America and then we cut
75:01 it away from them using the
75:02 Revolutionary War so in their mind we
75:06 stole this land from them now
75:09 technically speaking they're right we
75:12 stole this land from them but what we
75:14 also stole back was our sovereignty we
75:17 formed the Constitution based on Magna
75:19 Carta and unlike Magna Carta we've done
75:22 much better enforcing it over the years
75:25 but again we're only in
75:25 this experiment for about 400 years
75:27 rolling to the Constitution for what 250
75:31 so some of you will go down the path of
75:35 great concern I can't say that your
75:41 caution is not valid now I think that a
75:49 few things would become true very
75:50 quickly if this were to occur we may not
75:53 see president Trump in public for quite
75:55 a while because I think the attempts on
75:57 his life would be exponentially
76:00 increased it would be a financial war of
76:05 sorts
76:06 now if Europe would get with the program
76:09 and again a lot of Europeans who watch
76:12 you are part of this choir so I'm not
76:15 talking to you and I'm not criticizing
76:16 you at all you you share the same
76:18 frustrations that we share here in the
76:20 United States but on your soil over
76:23 there is where most these people live
76:25 you want to find them well look for
76:28 anyone who calls himself a king or a
76:30 queen look for anyone who calls
76:32 themselves part of a royal family and
76:34 that goes for all the Dukes and the
76:36 orals and all these people go out in
76:39 your countryside and look for homes that
76:41 are worth over 100 million dollars or
76:43 families that own 20 of those
76:46 institutions they have estates that are
76:49 worth billions of dollars well that's
76:53 the cause of the problem for all of us
76:55 in the world we have our own over here
76:58 too and hopefully get mo will be full of
77:00 a bunch of them they may stop at nothing
77:03 to create chaos in the world in order to
77:06 stop this problem now the stuff I'm
77:11 gonna mention is going to be hopefully
77:14 not alarming to most of you might be
77:16 alarming to some of useless if you just
77:17 found my channel and you're starting to
77:19 become woke but you're not quite there
77:20 yet I wouldn't put it past them to cause
77:24 great damage to this world
77:26 - perhaps false flag the fake some fake
77:31 war some kind right some attack
77:33 somewhere outside the United States
77:34 blamed on the United States through some
77:37 controlled narrative I think that'd be
77:38 very difficult but
77:39 they could potentially do that the two
77:43 things that I hear most often when
77:46 talking about the potential attacks
77:49 against the United States for doing this
77:50 it would be detonating a very large bomb
77:53 in a major city and potentially causing
77:58 some sort of viral outbreak but it
78:01 doesn't have any foreseeable cure some
78:05 99% virus right just like walking dead
78:08 reset the world just like the guides
78:10 don't say the guy at Georgia Guidestones
78:12 speak of the destruction of 99 percent
78:14 of the world's population as its first
78:16 commandment if you haven't heard about
78:18 the Georgia Guidestones you need to go
78:20 look those up it's a bunch of monoliths
78:23 when put together with ten commandments
78:26 of how to run the world the first one is
78:27 to reduce world population to 500
78:29 million given that they wouldn't start
78:32 at their maximum number they probably
78:34 started about 150 million which gets to
78:36 the 99% the 500 million is 98 okay they
78:42 could use weapons to create earthquakes
78:43 right I am now pretty convinced that a
78:48 lot of the major earthquakes we have
78:50 experienced it started offshore or all
78:52 bomb tests or bomb weapons right the one
78:55 in Indonesia in 2004 and I think
78:58 Fukushima both shows signs of really no
79:01 earthquake but massive tsunami
79:04 destruction right Japan was pretty much
79:06 intact after this 9.1 or whatever it was
79:10 quake then all sudden the wave came in
79:12 and buildings that had survived the 9.1
79:14 supposedly right just fell over when
79:17 water hit them which meant that they
79:18 weren't that strong to begin with but
79:20 again they wouldn't have survived a nine
79:21 point one because the shaking never
79:23 really occurred a shake occurred we saw
79:25 the video cameras of all those shakes
79:27 but the destruction doesn't call out it
79:29 being a real 9.1 earthquake may be the
79:35 epicenter of an explosion offshore
79:37 it was 9.1 here's the good news the good
79:41 news is is that our military the United
79:44 States military of all militaries on
79:45 planet Earth has been largely the
79:49 inventor of all of this technology
79:52 the viruses that have been invented in
79:54 these crazy labs are all controlled by
79:56 the United States military I think it's
79:59 pretty evident that the military is
80:01 behind Donald Trump he has more generals
80:04 at his side than any other president
80:06 I've ever seen in history even during
80:08 wartime and so does my hope that they
80:12 have before they stirred up the pot
80:15 before they shook the bees hive they
80:19 have accounted for all of these
80:20 anomalies to the best of their ability
80:22 they're listening to the entire world
80:24 anyone who communicates through any
80:26 electronic device is being spied on
80:28 whether or not they know it or not if
80:31 they transmit anything over the airwaves
80:34 it's being monitored and copied and
80:35 deciphered right but they know where we
80:40 can be attacked from the sea from the
80:42 sky our water supplies our cities which
80:45 is one reason why the border along
80:47 Mexico is so important it's not to keep
80:50 Mexican citizens out as much as it's to
80:52 keep out everyone who can pass
80:54 themselves off as the same color right
80:56 the more olive skin and black hair but
81:00 there's a lot of people who will take
81:01 money for anything there's obviously a
81:05 bunch of snowflakes that cry every
81:07 election you can definitely find one of
81:10 these disillusion kits probably really
81:12 young probably a complete nobody to do
81:14 anything that you can put in their hands
81:15 take this downtown and push this red
81:17 button
81:18 you're gonna die but it'll be worth it
81:19 okay but here's what we have the game by
81:22 taking the risk our sovereignty
81:28 completing the experiment that is the
81:30 American dream which would be a dream
81:32 for the entire world not our culture and
81:35 our ways of life but our sovereignty our
81:37 Republic every country should have that
81:40 around the world obviously we have
81:42 neighbors like China that are still
81:44 somewhat communistic I think over time
81:47 just as long as the leaders can stay
81:49 rich and in power they'll the leaves off
81:52 that paradigm over time they may have no
81:54 choice who knows
81:56 most countries want to be left alone
81:57 right China hasn't started a war I
82:00 believe in 400 years more than that so
82:04 all this talk about China starting a war
82:06 with us you're listening to a globalist
82:08 creating panic for no reason in my
82:13 opinion but it's important for all of
82:17 you to think this thing through for
82:20 yourself use all the logic that you have
82:22 and you know you might have way more
82:25 doomsday events in your brain than I
82:27 have I have more than I'm talking about
82:30 here but I just wanted to give a few so
82:32 you can think about it if anything like
82:36 this occurs it's important that we are
82:40 the beacon of truth most of you aware of
82:43 the event that happened in September of
82:45 2001 in America and the corresponding
82:50 events in England and Spain we know that
82:56 it was an orchestrated event to create a
82:59 narrative and a rationale and a means
83:01 and a pretense to do a bunch of stuff in
83:04 the Middle East we know that for a fact
83:06 now right do we know every single person
83:09 that was involved and who got what no
83:12 will we ever know I don't know probably
83:15 not hopefully so but probably not right
83:19 so when it occurred we were all enjoying
83:22 the 90s it rolled over to the 21st
83:25 century we're all happy that we made it
83:26 to the 21st century and when it occurred
83:30 we bought it hook line & sinker
83:31 most of us right I certainly did if you
83:34 didn't hats off to you men no Cooper
83:37 didn't and they shot him in his front
83:41 lawn right if anything like this occurs
83:44 some catastrophic event it's important
83:47 that your friends and family close to
83:49 you are settled down with the truth it's
83:52 a horrible event and we're at war
83:54 we're at war for the sovereignty of our
83:59 children mainly but depending on how old
84:02 you are and how many years you plan on
84:04 living your own sovereignty and sure
84:07 it'll be difficult
84:09 every time a criminal commits a crime
84:12 this is something you need to remember
84:14 the mechanism of that crime becomes
84:16 exposed right you know you have used to
84:20 have what 10 years ago a lot of
84:22 snatch-and-grab burglaries and it still
84:27 happens but it's much rarer now right
84:28 they they back a truck into a window and
84:31 then they run inside being stuck in the
84:33 back of the flatbed of the truck and
84:35 they grab items and put it in the truck
84:37 pull up the tailgate and drive off with
84:40 a hundred thousand dollars where the
84:42 computers or some [ __ ] right but the
84:45 more they commit that crime the method
84:47 of that crime becomes exposed and the
84:49 police yet smart to it they know what to
84:51 look for it becomes much easier to stop
84:54 that from happening as each one of these
84:57 events would occur in the United States
84:58 and who knows maybe they do a dozen in
85:00 one day maybe it's some slow crawling
85:03 virus right there's that there's that
85:07 game on the on the phone I forgot what
85:11 it's called like it's not called viruses
85:15 I don't think it's called pathogen but
85:16 it's something that's just you play the
85:18 game of spreading a virus all over the
85:20 world you try to kill as many people as
85:21 possible how [ __ ] insane is that
85:23 right we know that predictive
85:26 programming which I did an episode on I
85:29 took a slightly different angle on it a
85:31 predictive programming is a lot of
85:34 preparing society to accept something
85:36 they wouldn't otherwise accept let me
85:39 throw the Sacchi as we're closing off
85:41 this episode how many shows on TV and
85:45 how many movies and how many video games
85:48 have been leaning on this
85:50 post-apocalyptic world you have the
85:52 Fallout series in the video game you
85:54 have rust in the video game room you
85:58 have the Walking Dead on TV you have
86:02 what is it World War Z the movie with
86:05 Brad Pitt there's a tremendous amount a
86:08 post apocalyptic shows twelve Monkeys on
86:11 Hulu by the way it's a great show oh my
86:12 god there's about a virus that gets
86:14 loose of course all the people that are
86:18 the villains of the world become the
86:19 heroes in these scripts it's really
86:20 funny
86:22 that's how it gets funded that's how it
86:25 gets greenlit that could be predicted
86:27 programming for what is part of our
86:31 future can we stop it
86:34 I don't know hopefully hopefully
86:36 quarantine alone as a practice that'll
86:39 make it happen but part of these virus
86:41 designs is to infect the whole planet
86:43 before they know it and then poof you
86:46 know a certain microscopic percentage is
86:49 immune for those of you have studied
86:52 binary weapons it's a terrifying
86:56 technology where you're infected with a
86:59 and you're fine totally fine we live
87:02 with a inside your body even metabolize
87:05 it as a natural byproduct of your body
87:07 and then they hit you with B and you're
87:10 dead within minutes these weapons exist
87:14 the United States Arsenal I'm sure they
87:15 exist in other countries and you never
87:18 know it's one of the reasons why we
87:21 believe that planes shouldn't leave big
87:24 giant clouds in the sky which has been
87:27 pawned off as a military situation I
87:32 dearly hope that's not the case but if
87:35 we're completely immune to jets dumping
87:38 stuff on us whether it be a fuel
87:40 additive and it's really benign but ba
87:42 ba ba ba doesn't matter the day they
87:45 want to spray us with an a they would
87:46 use the same apparatus and if our
87:49 military is allowing some shadow
87:51 government to do this to us
87:53 and they're not you know scrambling
87:55 f-16s to get these things out of the sky
87:58 the second they start spraying a trail
88:00 or second a plane without any
88:02 identification flies over us then it
88:06 could be a problem I don't want to end
88:08 this on some alarmist note okay
88:11 I've always been the subscriber to I've
88:17 been a subscriber to the notion that
88:19 chaos is not something that these
88:21 individuals want because you can't
88:24 control chaos imagine you were just a
88:27 frail little pasty white guy with all
88:30 this power in some estate in Europe and
88:33 you create this kind of chaos
88:35 and all these truthers get together and
88:37 they seeds those houses and they killed
88:40 those people well that's something they
88:42 don't want right so orchestrating
88:46 something on that massive level I think
88:47 is I would say close to impossible to
88:52 survive even then however we all know
88:55 the old analogy of backing an animal
88:57 into a corner it goes feral and whatever
89:00 it has it throws it at you right and so
89:04 we have to be careful the velocity of
89:07 which these changes are made no one
89:11 understands that principle more that the
89:14 United States military commanders they
89:16 understand the psychology of war they
89:19 understand the psychology of leadership
89:22 under great pressure and the way that
89:25 they react it's their job they study it
89:28 constantly they have expert consulting
89:31 firms to study it constantly so when
89:35 they sit around a table and they plan
89:37 things big things you need to I think
89:42 take some confidence and some security
89:45 and the fact that we are indeed
89:47 protected by the the organizations that
89:49 we fund now a lot of people know that
89:53 the military industrial complex has been
89:56 controlled by these individuals for the
89:58 majority of its existence
89:59 I think perhaps my hopeful thinking is
90:02 that this has changed considerably for
90:04 them that they've had a rebirth that
90:07 people are sick and tired of looking at
90:09 spy data and finding pedophiles and all
90:12 levels of government and citizens I
90:16 think that quite frankly in the history
90:19 books if it's ever written truthfully if
90:21 q and on is real and this whole thing is
90:23 real with Trump as we believe it is that
90:25 will come out in the history books that
90:28 the the time that you know after that
90:32 day in September of 2001 occurred and we
90:35 increased our spine we found this and
90:38 individuals were unwilling to look the
90:40 other way and when they were unwilling
90:42 to look the other way their eyes were
90:44 opened they were enlightened and they
90:46 looked all over the world and said Oh
90:48 my god I had no idea how bad this was
90:52 we have lost millions of people in this
90:55 world due to war as far as I know every
91:01 soldier of every country takes an oath
91:03 to protect their country that's the
91:05 purpose of creating an army we have
91:10 cemeteries full of millions and millions
91:13 of people who have fallen trying to
91:16 protect that oath when I ten years ago I
91:21 had a good exposure to some pretty deep
91:24 military individuals and just some
91:26 individuals who serve their ten years
91:29 and got out and they did a bunch of
91:30 covert operations and all this other
91:31 stuff and I you know I haven't really
91:33 been told any about any covert
91:34 operations or anything any specific
91:37 detail they would just simply say I was
91:39 I was at a place where according to the
91:42 world history I was never at these
91:44 events never occurred that kind of thing
91:46 right I said what would you do if your
91:52 government said in 9 States of America
91:54 especially this is where the
91:55 conversation was centered if they said
91:57 seize all the weapons of all the people
91:59 get rid of the Second Amendment and I
92:01 had a very decorated individual who
92:06 managed the war theater and big chunk of
92:09 the war theater in the Middle East
92:11 essentially say that's when we would
92:15 arrest the person who gave us the order
92:17 I said really tell me more what
92:23 motivates that instant turnaround why
92:25 why wouldn't you do that right now and
92:27 he goes well right now it's just a
92:28 conspiracy theory coming out of you guys
92:29 on YouTube and online but the second it
92:32 becomes a reality we know that all those
92:34 conspiracies are now suddenly true or
92:36 more true than false right this guy was
92:40 very seasoned he was in his 50s and he
92:43 said every single soldier that's ever
92:46 been to war and pretty much every
92:48 soldier that's been in the military for
92:49 last 20 years has lost a friend a lot of
92:54 families have lost their loved ones and
92:57 he said that
92:59 that command alone which is pretty much
93:01 a tiny change compared to all the stuff
93:04 we've covered in this video
93:07 that basically disgraces every single
93:10 tombstone of at least American soldiers
93:15 why they died why they took their oath
93:18 and it invalidate s' the oath that
93:20 everyone took who's currently in the
93:23 military so in order to preserve the
93:25 integrity of those who gave their lives
93:27 for freedom we have to be willing to put
93:32 our skin in the game and arrest those
93:35 trying to make those types of changes I
93:37 thought that was extremely enlightening
93:40 to me and gave me a big breath of fresh
93:44 air so I want to leave you guys with
93:47 that because I do believe that 99.9
93:50 percent of this planet is very peaceful
93:51 we just want to get along when our big
93:54 TVs we don't worry about any one pair
93:56 trooping in our backyards for some
93:57 stupid reason we will work it out if the
94:02 Federal Reserve crashes in this country
94:04 so will there be a little bit of chaos
94:07 sure especially on the first day maybe
94:09 in even the first week but the human
94:11 mind can't hang on to that much
94:12 negativity and that much energy going in
94:15 a bad place we can't and so will calm
94:18 down and we'll find solutions because
94:20 what will man want to do man will want
94:23 to find a solution we just so happened
94:25 at this particular state have a very
94:28 healthy wise president who has even
94:31 smarter people behind him assuring this
94:35 through this this era it is probably an
94:40 imperative that this event occur if we
94:44 really want to gain back the strength
94:46 and sovereignty of at least America for
94:49 the Europeans it applies to you just as
94:51 much all of you have old plates of your
94:56 money and you just need to get them off
94:59 the shelf and redo them
95:00 so that's your money get your monarchs
95:02 off your money ok it's for the people
95:04 it's not for the monarchs right if you
95:07 want to honor a leader that has been a
95:09 good leader to your country and then put
95:10 their face on the money
95:11 okay it's probably sketchy to say but I
95:17 hope it occurs do I fear for my own
95:21 financial security when that occurs sure
95:23 absolutely
95:25 but I have faith that we'll figure it
95:27 out if I have to be homeless for two
95:30 years to make this event occur so be it
95:33 I realize I've lived my entire life
95:35 already pretty much in terms of all the
95:37 goals I ever wanted and I can say that a
95:40 little bit more securely but I have a
95:42 child I don't want that child to go
95:45 through some horrible state but if I
95:47 look at her life in this rat race versus
95:52 a little bit of discomfort for a couple
95:54 years and then she can live an amazing
95:57 life afterwards and your kids - I think
96:00 we owe it to our kids to pull it through
96:02 we're gonna have to be the adults to
96:05 keep them calm and to contribute to the
96:07 solutions I think at this point there
96:10 are more schematics for fixing this
96:11 problem then there are to keep it going
96:13 right economic collapse and boom and
96:17 bust cycles are all based on the old
96:19 system the current system being in place
96:21 once we replace it but I'll be a thing
96:23 of yesteryear
96:24 it really will and I think we want to go
96:27 there that's about all I have here if
96:31 you haven't been a deep thoughts
96:33 radio.com
96:33 please go there's audio video a locked
96:37 Facebook group and a patreon page for
96:40 everyone who supports me
96:41 I very much appreciate it this is our
96:43 endeavour I never thought when I created
96:45 this show and said the words rebuilding
96:48 society from the ground up that we would
96:50 ever truly have that capability so
96:52 quickly especially during the lifetime
96:54 of this show it looks like we might
96:57 actually get that opportunity so you
97:01 guys are brilliant people you have
97:03 amazing knowledge I don't have use it
97:08 you know when someone asks me the
97:11 question and what can I do to help
97:13 everything spread information research
97:16 things use your intelligence not just
97:18 your smarts combine the two to create
97:21 great solutions think about what you
97:23 would do in your local region if that
97:24 ever
97:25 where you gonna get your food from where
97:26 you get your resources from think about
97:29 those things you probably don't have to
97:30 be a doomsday prepper but you know do a
97:33 little bit to secure your thought
97:36 process and this maybe even brief people
97:38 in your local circle well this might
97:40 occur and I want you not to panic
97:42 because this is probably the things that
97:43 are going to Kurt da da da right
97:46 anyway take care of yourself and someone
97:49 else and I'll see you in the next deep
97:50 thoughts over now
