00:33 ladies and gentleman to detox I'm not
00:39 exactly sure what I'm going to call this
00:41 episodes I'm not going to say it this is
00:44 going to be about the way corporations
00:47 end up working almost every single time
00:51 one could call it corporate greed but
00:56 there is more to it than that
00:57 because it's an infectious mindset that
01:00 really sucks and I've seen it strictly
01:03 from the standpoint of American products
01:06 and there seems to be an American thing
01:09 about the problem that I'm going to
01:12 describe but then again it could exist
01:14 in every single corporation and you know
01:16 in Europe as well I just don't have
01:17 experience with it over there but you
01:20 know we're always talking about on this
01:21 show is that this show is all about
01:23 talking about subjects that subjects
01:26 that we don't really talk about that
01:28 much but we really need to write well
01:34 this is one of those things we really
01:36 need to talk about and I'm just going to
01:37 give you an example right away and then
01:41 what we're going to do is we're gonna go
01:42 through several examples of where this
01:44 has happened where it probably is
01:46 happening right now and then discuss how
01:50 we avoid it so very similar to the
01:54 politics episode people are like I don't
01:57 wanna listen to an episode about
01:58 politics when you listen to it you
02:00 understand it's about the organic growth
02:02 of a society on a banded Island and how
02:06 various pockets just simply organically
02:10 create themselves
02:11 and so we're going to do that exam
02:14 exercise to the best of my ability for
02:16 this particular problem because I think
02:20 it's important we have in America
02:22 corporations that tend to create
02:25 monopolies on industries which are
02:29 illegal in America but then again the
02:32 government looks the other way because
02:34 you know to open up the can of worms of
02:36 going after every monopolies it is a
02:39 risky thing for them to do so you're
02:43 supposed to have a duopoly which is
02:45 essentially two choices or a choice of
02:48 some kind but what it really comes down
02:51 to it there's tremendous there there are
02:53 a tremendous amount of resources where
02:56 we don't have any choice I don't have
02:59 choice to buy water from any other
03:00 location besides where I buy water from
03:02 I don't have choice of buying garbage
03:06 collection services from anyone else and
03:09 so I have to pay this exorbitant price
03:12 that they charge we're picking up
03:13 [ __ ] trash in a trash can and then
03:15 recycling my trash you're making a
03:17 profit off of it right you know no
03:19 reflection on the people that have to do
03:21 the work but the corporation's
03:23 themselves but we have elective
03:26 corporations that pop up and some
03:29 strategic ones and there's just a real
03:32 interesting trend going on in the world
03:34 which is actually been pretty cool over
03:36 the last 15 years or so now I do not
03:41 know if this chain existed in Europe so
03:44 apologize for listening to it over there
03:46 but we had a movie rental place over
03:49 here called Blockbuster I'm pretty sure
03:52 they were the International if they
03:53 could but they may call it something
03:54 different over there over there it's
03:56 just a reference to wherever you are if
03:58 it's not here the blockbuster was this
04:01 place you go into movie rental joint you
04:04 know once the little mom-and-pop shops
04:05 had established the fact that this
04:07 little system work you could buy movies
04:09 and then rent them out of course the
04:12 studios were kind of not on board
04:15 because they're like look they're not
04:17 buying the VHS tape anymore
04:19 they're renting the VHS tape so we want
04:21 part of that money I don't have I don't
04:24 have any idea how the license
04:25 work on the backend but you have these
04:29 movie rental places and what they did
04:31 was you go and rent them and they barely
04:34 give you enough time to really see the
04:36 movie organically within your household
04:38 because you know you're ready to see it
04:39 but your wife's not there your husband's
04:41 not there your kids aren't there or
04:42 whatever your date's not there and if
04:44 you were late if you rented the thing
04:47 for three bucks
04:48 you're late fee was like 350 one just
04:53 you slip past the deadline of checking
04:55 out of the hotel you know in this place
04:58 had a stranglehold on America for nearly
05:00 20 years you go rent a movie and if
05:04 anything was they know if it was super
05:06 popular came out the day of you know the
05:09 release day of the VHS tape they would
05:11 have you know 4050 copies of a
05:13 particular movie and so only 40 50
05:18 people per franchise would get a chance
05:21 to take one home and rent it but you
05:24 would get dinged two-thirds of your bill
05:26 to to Blockbuster for most folks was
05:30 your late fees and that sounds like
05:32 these people are super irresponsible but
05:34 it's really not the case when you have
05:36 these drop-off you know windows you push
05:39 them through almost like mail slots you
05:40 know and then something happened about
05:43 15 years ago now maybe no sorry probably
05:46 10 years ago I apologize we had
05:49 something called red box come out we had
05:51 Netflix come out and Netflix was hey
05:55 just tell us what you want we will send
05:58 you up to a certain amount of DVDs to
06:00 your house to watch the films keep them
06:02 as long as you want and you know you
06:07 won't get any more or you have to pay
06:08 for them if you lose them sort of thing
06:10 so now there was no late fee the red box
06:14 came out I was you know we still have
06:16 them to this day they set up next to
06:18 drug stores packed full of films I don't
06:21 believe there's any late fee when you
06:22 get done you just drive up stick them in
06:24 there to build any human being and it's
06:28 like a jukebox and Netflix did something
06:31 interesting that they were allowed to
06:32 actually press the DVD copy it at their
06:37 location
06:38 for some stupid reason there's you know
06:41 a bunch of a bunch of movies and
06:44 television shows you can't still you
06:46 still can't see them online you have to
06:47 rent the DVD I have no idea what the
06:50 hell they're thinking with that some
06:53 goddamn fossil and [ __ ] Hollywood
06:55 distribution but here's the reason why I
06:57 mentioned this blockbuster got shut the
07:01 [ __ ] down by these other services
07:04 because something happened every single
07:08 time we got ding with this [ __ ]
07:10 Lacey one it's really really high - you
07:14 knew that was the gimmick you knew that
07:17 was the [ __ ] gimmick they know life
07:18 gets difficult it takes time to organize
07:21 everyone together you do your best to
07:22 get the tape before to create the kind
07:25 of the window of opportunity so in the
07:26 family kind of walks in the living room
07:28 at the same time you're like boom there
07:30 gotcha watch this movie but the
07:32 penalties were insane right if you took
07:34 all the revenue from Blockbuster I can
07:37 assure you more than 51% of the revenue
07:39 was generated through late fees and so
07:43 you have this company that's most likely
07:45 created by an individual with his
07:47 partners and then you have it gets
07:51 bigger I don't know if the guy stood on
07:54 you know the bull the whole time but
07:57 when it's over you hate the corporation
07:58 I can't tell you how I and we had
08:02 another one Hollywood rental same [ __ ]
08:05 maybe they had a slightly a linear more
08:07 leniency towards bringing it in late
08:09 because they knew this was the selca
08:11 sales pitch a blockbusters invented this
08:15 huge expansion of the mom-and-pop store
08:17 formula of renting movies they've moved
08:19 into territories that mountain tops
08:21 can't afford to build these stores and
08:22 and they've but there there weren't the
08:25 reason everyone hates them as they are
08:27 these late fees and then we have
08:29 Hollywood rental comes in last second
08:32 too late they both go down like the
08:35 Titanic we hate them and every time I
08:38 Drive by and see an old blockbuster it
08:41 just brings the kind of a cool feeling
08:44 to my chest that they're out of business
08:45 and the Internet's bring in this on this
08:50 isn't going to be just about this
08:51 formula
08:52 in terms of you know business was bad
08:54 and somebody took them out but this is
08:56 going to get it the jugular of what we
08:59 have to deal with as citizens dealing
09:01 with corporations and the ultimate
09:04 evolutionary step of a corporation that
09:06 is almost in my life it's been
09:09 inevitable there's only a couple
09:12 companies in the world that I think have
09:13 not fallen for this and they're not
09:16 American
09:17 so as an American citizen I want
09:20 Americans to have a little bit of
09:22 goddamn pride for craftsmanship if we're
09:26 going to bring manufacturing back to the
09:27 United States of America we have to
09:29 learn how to do it right and we don't
09:33 [ __ ] know how to do it right let me
09:35 tell you maybe the citizens do but the
09:36 corporate people that pay for [ __ ] they
09:38 absolutely don't we're going to get to
09:39 all the dynamics of it Schick and
09:42 Gillette two companies that make razor
09:46 blades to cut hair off of our body what
09:50 have they been doing for the last
09:51 hundred and fifty goddamn years they
09:54 have been gouging the living [ __ ] out of
09:56 us for what amounts to a couple cents
09:58 worth of material to make a blade
10:00 claiming that they have this gigantic
10:03 R&D budget that they have to make up
10:05 when hey man if you just grind steel to
10:09 be really sharp it cuts [ __ ] it cuts it
10:12 what did it cost in America to buy four
10:15 blades for your for your razor $24 $24
10:23 these [ __ ] wanted so much money per
10:27 blade that you could buy an album of
10:30 music nearly for the same exact price
10:35 per blade so what's happened we now have
10:39 the Dollar Shave Club right Dollar Shave
10:42 Club came out with this really cute ad
10:44 on the internet where you said look
10:46 aren't you sick and tired of this
10:47 [ __ ] of paying too much for blades
10:49 well hey for 10 bucks a month you can
10:51 get six blades fact ethically yeah you
10:54 get like six blades a month by the time
10:57 I tell you when you sign up for this
10:58 thing you end up getting so many blades
11:00 you got to turn it off and they've
11:02 actually fixed their website or it added
11:04 a feature to their website just to turn
11:06 billing for six months because they know
11:09 they ship them out so fast that people
11:10 don't use them all
11:12 inow chic and Gillette are dying these
11:17 jerk-offs who have been raping us for
11:21 decade after decade after decade now
11:25 some of you might blow this off and go
11:26 we'll do do this and corporations do and
11:29 I agree and we're going to talk about
11:30 that because if we want to really
11:32 rebuild any level of respect from the
11:34 world to America we have to actually
11:36 have a different opinion about how we
11:39 run corporations now come from the
11:43 Midwest where if what when you go into
11:46 certain people's homes depending on how
11:48 old they are although it's kind of
11:49 fading away they so if you you know if
11:55 you go into a an older person some the
11:58 Midwest it's you know I'm almost talking
12:01 about my grandparents so they're
12:02 probably not alive much up they're not
12:04 in their 80s and 90s they're hundreds
12:06 but you'll start finding appliances in
12:08 their home that were built when America
12:11 actually had a little bit of dignity and
12:14 standards and you know the appliances
12:17 built in the 50s still work today as
12:20 long as the tubes still work the radios
12:22 still work but back in the day the
12:25 Phonographic players worked from back in
12:27 the day and then there was this this
12:32 epiphany at some point in Americans
12:34 history Americans history we're cheap
12:38 [ __ ] became a an acceptable standard
12:43 everything was a disposable razor your
12:46 television is a disposable razor all
12:48 your furnitures a disposable razor
12:49 you're just supposed to use it for a
12:51 little bit and get rid of it let's think
12:53 about it what are some of the things in
12:56 the world that appreciate and value
12:57 because people actually put blood sweat
13:02 and tears into the product Harley
13:05 Davidsons used to always appreciate in
13:07 value right you know fine European
13:11 vehicles always appreciate in value
13:13 you know the Honda Civic the Toyota
13:17 Corolla
13:18 these objects always appreciate in value
13:21 or hold as much value as possible
13:24 because they are built with a particular
13:26 standard in place and we go back for
13:29 more because of the standards so high
13:31 the Apple computer is in the utter phase
13:36 of demise right now because it's being
13:39 run by a complete [ __ ] idiot who has
13:42 no background to have his job who uses
13:45 his position to do nothing more than
13:47 engage in political personal agendas I
13:51 mean I would have fired this guy and
13:53 Scarlet Letter his ass a long time ago I
13:57 mean the cup is losing market share
14:00 because he won't protect their
14:02 innovations and for the very first time
14:06 in the last say five years I was at an
14:09 Apple store and it was having some
14:11 issues with the computer and the genius
14:14 you know said well you know you can't it
14:18 goes your computers two years old so
14:20 yeah so what well you can't expect a
14:22 computer lasts longer than two years
14:24 that's just about is just about the
14:26 life's lifespan of that couldn't believe
14:30 my ears man couldn't believe my ears but
14:33 that is and that's some hipster douche
14:36 bag you know it doesn't want to do his
14:38 job he's [ __ ] sixty pounds overweight
14:40 sweating through every [ __ ] clan in
14:42 his body cuz it's trying to kill him
14:45 let me give you a few more because I
14:48 said I want you to just kind of think
14:50 about this Corvette Corvette when I was
14:54 a kid you could buy a Corvette for under
14:56 ten thousand dollars when I was a kid
14:57 granted a home was about between 30 and
14:59 40 thousand dollars where I lived so it
15:01 wasn't cheap but a child growing up
15:06 could attach himself to this Corvette
15:09 you know he had movies like Corvette
15:10 Sommers
15:11 you know we had Corvettes inside movies
15:14 like death race 2000 and Cannonball Run
15:16 and all those kind of good stuff you
15:18 just saw them around they were
15:19 accessible guys with you know between a
15:23 hundred and you know 180 IQ could afford
15:26 one like you didn't have to be a genius
15:28 to [ __ ] buy a Corvette
15:30 it became an icon
15:32 American muscle car it became an icon of
15:34 just incredible design nothing looked
15:37 like that car yeah the first ones look
15:40 like some other cars but by 1978 nothing
15:43 looked like that car right so what
15:47 happens Kentucky got all up into
15:53 themselves and kept raising the price
15:54 and raising the price until right now
15:57 the price is completely inaccessible
16:00 you're going to be spending anywhere
16:02 from sixty to a hundred thousand dollars
16:03 one of those cars and you're not going
16:05 to get the top model at 100 grand you're
16:08 not it's a two-seater no matter how you
16:10 slice it right now know what actually
16:14 starting we back up you're one second
16:16 the car got redesigned in 1983 for this
16:20 new model and I think mainly it released
16:22 in 84 and they barely changed it and
16:27 when you were a kid in the seventies
16:28 Corvette was always putting out these
16:30 concept cars these paintings and these
16:33 designs and then they built a couple
16:34 concept cars this is what it's going to
16:35 look like in 2000 I think they even did
16:38 one for 2007 for some reason but you
16:41 look forward to Corvette kind of
16:43 pioneering the the muscle car of America
16:47 getting up to literally a spaceship and
16:49 then something happened they didn't
16:52 redesign the car the 80s finishes up the
16:56 ante of the same car around taillights
16:58 round rectangle tail lights who gives a
17:00 [ __ ] right got rid of the pop-up
17:02 headlights then you go into the 90s and
17:05 it stayed the same you go into the 2000s
17:07 the 21st century nothing special at 2000
17:11 back in the 70s
17:13 from all the guys that dropped acid who
17:15 dreamed up these amazing cars well those
17:17 guys are long gone out of the company at
17:19 least and I sat on a plane in the I
17:23 don't know exactly when I think goes in
17:25 the nineties i sat in a plane and with
17:28 this guy from Kentucky who works for
17:31 Corvette and I sat there and I said dude
17:34 when I was a kid Corvettes were badass
17:36 they were amazing everybody wanted one I
17:39 said what the [ __ ] you guys doing now
17:42 the only people I ever see in a Corvette
17:44 are very old
17:46 with completely gray hair either by
17:50 themselves with their old lady that's
17:51 exactly the same there is there are no
17:53 mark Hamill's driving Corvettes there's
17:55 no young kids driving Corvettes
17:57 you just don't and you know isn't his uh
18:00 his statement back at me was he said
18:03 yeah well we sell every single one of
18:05 them we sell every single Corvette we
18:09 make on the line so we don't think we
18:11 have a problem this is the short-sighted
18:15 ignorant corporate greed that makes this
18:18 happen because what was actually
18:22 technically happening to the market as
18:24 we moved into the 21st century they
18:26 realized that no one's buying their
18:27 [ __ ] cars anymore I mean they're
18:30 buying it but they're not they're their
18:31 audience is dying off it's like the old
18:34 Elvis story where you know blue haired
18:35 women started showing up to his concerts
18:38 in the seventies and it's driving them
18:39 crazy I don't know why that's the case
18:43 because it wasn't that goddamn old so
18:47 what happens I go to Lake Havasu
18:49 probably out in 2009/2010 I'm following
18:53 the boat to the slip and all of a sudden
18:56 this bright yellow and I mean like crazy
19:00 oh not Ferrari yellow not piss yellow
19:03 just crazy fluorescent yellow thing is
19:06 in front of me I'm looking at this
19:08 thinking what the hell is that and I
19:10 don't even know it's a special edition
19:12 model of the Corvette there was a brand
19:14 new Corvette and I'm looking this thing
19:16 on has anyone else seen this this is
19:18 like a spaceship on wheels right in
19:20 front of me I've only seen a couple like
19:22 this since the new models will come out
19:25 but I felt amazing for one split second
19:29 because I thought someone in Kentucky
19:31 got it finally finally they realized
19:33 they're going to continue to exist they
19:35 need to bring on new fans you know the
19:38 only thing they haven't done is brought
19:39 down the pricing I'm sure that's very
19:42 tough now we go look at a Corvette today
19:46 they're absolutely gorgeous
19:48 they're amazing I see them when I fill
19:50 up my gas at the gas station it's
19:53 usually someone who's got one about
19:54 every five visits and they're just
19:57 stunning and I talked to the owners I
19:59 walked up and I said we
20:00 think men so this is the most amazing
20:02 car ever owned that I've owned a lot of
20:03 cars if America is going to take back
20:07 its manufacturing we have to absolutely
20:10 rebirth our complete corporate attitude
20:14 towards products product manufacturing
20:16 but it's like it's like building a
20:19 bridge you know in your little kid and
20:22 you build a bridge how do you do it with
20:24 your Legos you start on one side
20:26 whatever chasm you're crossing you start
20:30 putting your Legos down and you just
20:31 keep going until you go to the other
20:33 side put the last legal in at the other
20:35 side but how do they do it in real life
20:38 they build from one side to the other
20:41 side and they meet in the middle
20:42 building you know the columns support
20:45 grids or whatever that's how they do it
20:49 well that's our analogy for recapturing
20:52 manufacturing in America and if you're
20:54 in Europe listening this simply think
20:56 about what you do because a lot of you
20:58 guys do it right - Mercedes BMW you know
21:02 there's all kinds of great manufacturers
21:04 over there Jaguar Bentley of course
21:06 Ferrari Porsche plant borghini it's just
21:09 the list goes on and on and and I think
21:11 we're trying to get to the standard
21:13 that's over there to be honest but I
21:15 think we can perhaps come up with some
21:18 creative ways to to perhaps surpass and
21:22 some of the metrics some of the
21:23 attributes of product creation we just
21:26 put our heads to it but what are the two
21:28 sides that we're bringing close together
21:29 right on one side we have the people
21:34 that actually put the objects together
21:39 we have to care we have to carry about
21:43 every nut and bolt and bearing and wire
21:45 we have to care your care about the way
21:48 that things are stamped and manufactured
21:50 and put together and welded we have to
21:53 pretend like every object that we are
21:55 building is going to go into our homes
21:57 and we don't want the damn thing to
22:00 break whether be our american-made
22:03 Webber grill our american-made Ford
22:06 Chrysler GM product american-made
22:10 computer we have to care
22:14 where it comes down to a human being
22:17 determining the level of quality
22:20 assembly right there's robots that can
22:21 do things and we have a lot of things
22:24 automated in terms of chip manufacturing
22:25 all that kind of stuff well to the
22:27 degree that the robot does it correct we
22:29 don't need to worry about that part I'm
22:30 talking about the part that has to do
22:33 with the way that something is assembled
22:35 and we're going to get to the whole
22:37 thing of planned obsolescence before we
22:40 close this thing off now the other thing
22:43 is that the leaders of the corporation
22:46 have to adopt the philosophy that
22:48 whatever you're building should last for
22:52 goddamn ever and the reason why they
22:55 don't subscribe to that notion is
22:57 because they've taken some some they've
22:59 got some shitty economics degree or
23:02 business you know MBA from somewhere and
23:04 they've heard this cliche in their head
23:06 and they think they're [ __ ] geniuses
23:07 but they're just their utter tail
23:11 grabbing morons I hate to say that but
23:14 it's true
23:15 they believe that and this is where
23:18 we're getting to play in obsolescence
23:19 they believe if you make a product
23:21 that's going to last forever then you
23:22 will sell one product to everyone and
23:25 your company will be over right and you
23:28 won't be able to increase sales market
23:30 share and your company will go out of
23:33 business because the dividends to your
23:35 stock owners and your and your share
23:38 your shareholders and your board of
23:39 directors it'll just fizzle out well it
23:43 hasn't hurt the Honda Civic it hasn't
23:47 hurt the Toyota Corolla for my buddies
23:50 in Orange County to collect exotic cars
23:52 it hasn't heard any of their business
23:54 and the manufacturers that make their
23:56 cars right it's a fallacy that that
23:59 model actually is a demise model right
24:04 thing is this what keeps the company on
24:09 top or close enough to the top that
24:13 everyone gets paid every single month
24:15 the company never ever worries about its
24:21 its demise it never worries about
24:23 closing its doors ever
24:26 it's companies that build quality
24:28 products those are the companies that
24:31 don't worry about anything it's the
24:34 company that's dealing in the sheisty
24:36 [ __ ] techniques of trying to make
24:38 products just good enough to be
24:41 purchased and used for a couple of years
24:43 like the fat kid at that Apple Genius
24:46 Bar told me but eventually that ends
24:50 because eventually we realize that we're
24:53 getting robbed right we're getting
24:57 completely robbed and if America is ever
25:00 going to get back its manufacturing we
25:02 cannot go a second round a second
25:05 opportunity and turn it into the final
25:08 death blow of this country by creating
25:11 [ __ ] products because we have [ __ ]
25:12 attitudes towards everything right there
25:15 has to be a point you know when you
25:18 manufacture something and 10 20 30 years
25:20 goes by and you look back at it and the
25:22 [ __ ] thing still works and you're
25:23 like you know why that works because I
25:25 put my heart and soul into that product
25:27 you know we built them out of switches
25:31 that were thick enough to be turned off
25:32 and on 200,000 times before I even
25:36 remotely losses its molecular integrity
25:39 integrity right and it takes 500,000
25:43 times before it breaks maybe you know
25:47 there's that whole thing in society of
25:49 you know joining a group or trying to
25:53 join a tribe we talked about it you know
25:55 incessantly on this show imagine an
25:58 executive that goes in here's a new kid
26:00 still drying up the pimples on his face
26:03 from college and in his mind he has her
26:07 mind they have an idealistic view of
26:10 which is what we're talking about on
26:11 this show a view that we need to do our
26:15 best and they get in the room with all
26:18 of the super overweight high blood
26:21 pressure [ __ ] two seconds away from a
26:24 massive heart attack guys and perhaps
26:29 gals and they they laugh it off ha ha ha
26:33 you whippersnapper look how wet behind
26:37 the ears this kid is
26:39 and that person has a choice try to
26:43 figure out how to do it on your own try
26:47 to figure out how to convince these old
26:49 [ __ ] how to think like a decent human
26:51 being or what most often happens is join
26:56 them go oh gosh I guess I was just naive
27:01 that I was keeping my morals in place
27:04 I was naive that I wanted to look in the
27:06 mirror and feel proud of myself I guess
27:11 the way of the world is to just get
27:14 what's mine and [ __ ] everybody else
27:16 because that's what it is right
27:18 sell them a bunch of cheap [ __ ] they
27:20 don't need take all that money buy your
27:22 summer home and your jet ski or whatever
27:25 the hell you're doing and drive your
27:27 Bentley to the 7-eleven right I can tell
27:32 you I know a few of these people and
27:35 once they join that sort of regimen of
27:40 life they embed that shitty system
27:45 inside their own personal life that's
27:47 how they raise their children that's how
27:49 they take care of their spouse that's
27:52 how they clean their bodies in the
27:53 morning it's all cheap it's all shallow
27:59 life is in life life is a character to
28:02 your picture of life and it all happens
28:05 at that inception amoment when some
28:07 other lazy bastard teaches a child that
28:10 being a lazy bastard it's just the way
28:12 to go I know a lot of you who have lots
28:17 of siblings in your family or you've
28:19 watched this happen where someone has
28:21 three children and you know you judge
28:25 the three kids you know or when you talk
28:27 about the three kids you talk about them
28:28 in their level of engagement to life
28:32 well you know the first kid the one
28:33 often became a doctor in the second kid
28:35 you know went off to become a landscape
28:37 person and the third kid just was a drug
28:39 addicts hung out in the garage was
28:41 totally lazy duh how many times have you
28:44 heard that story in your lifetime right
28:47 the kid that will beg for eight hours on
28:50 the sidewalk or sorry I should say
28:52 sixteen hours on the sidewalk for enough
28:54 money just eat and put some new clothes
28:57 on when they could go get a job for
28:59 eight hours a day get to eight hours
29:00 back to have fun sleep for eight hours
29:01 after that and have money left over in
29:04 the bank it's that of course we all know
29:06 and I won't get into it much but there's
29:08 the welfare socialistic state that comes
29:10 up to satiate kids with bad education
29:13 right I've said it a couple of times on
29:16 this show I bumped into a woman who
29:18 works for the Taco Bell corporation down
29:19 the street here in Irvine California
29:22 she bought a bunch of Taco Bell to a
29:24 party I was at I'd already fed everyone
29:26 with some home homemade barbecue that a
29:30 buddy of mine did at his restaurant
29:31 everyone was already full she brings all
29:34 this Taco Bell nobody wants to eat a
29:35 single you know taco of it because it's
29:39 [ __ ] food and everyone knows it
29:41 but she's sitting there with this big
29:43 table top of a Taco Bell that's just
29:46 getting soggy with every second that
29:47 goes by and I can guarantee you at that
29:51 second because she could smell the
29:52 barbecue that I had brought and it
29:55 smells good it smelled like food it was
29:57 made of real [ __ ] beef you know and
30:01 she started laughing it off and she
30:04 started on yeah this is [ __ ] food that
30:07 we make and she probably went on for
30:10 about 15 20 minutes telling us about
30:12 every single shenanigan that taco belly
30:15 does to shave down the cost of things
30:19 right you know they have they have used
30:23 an e.coli scare for onions to take
30:25 onions off of off of their food so I
30:27 don't do buy it anymore but they get to
30:28 charge you the same amount of money
30:29 she says they shave a millimeter off of
30:32 a shell every year to make the product
30:35 smaller but they keep the price the same
30:37 it's not evil doing that it's just cheap
30:42 right their meat is less than 15% beef
30:46 the other 85% plus is a bunch of weird
30:51 [ __ ] elbows and binders and weird crazy
30:55 flavorful things that don't have any
30:57 nutrition in them at all so where does
31:00 this attitude come from
31:01 right well a lot of you already know
31:04 this and you've been yelling at the
31:06 episode but what's it what's the
31:10 difference between a company that's
31:12 trying to create a great product and a
31:15 corporation that creates products
31:19 corporation
31:21 well little tiny mom-and-pop shop is
31:23 owned by a mom-and-pop couple has been a
31:25 wife couple with their kids that work
31:27 there maybe the kids friends make a
31:29 couple buddies of the family that they
31:31 trust right but people just get their
31:33 paycheck they go home they have a great
31:34 standard of living hopefully and they
31:36 live their life in the end the family
31:40 owns a place makes more profit but you
31:42 know maybe in the end they can sell the
31:44 restaurant off to someone but or
31:46 whatever the product is a hardware store
31:48 a print store where you get your
31:49 business cards or something like that
31:51 these are the places in my hometown when
31:52 I was a kid
31:54 someone might buy the place off of you
31:56 just to get your customer list but you
31:59 know in a small town if a diner closes
32:02 down and that's it the diners never
32:04 coming back and you open up a diner
32:06 close buyer in the same sing the same
32:08 spot you don't have to pay them any
32:10 royalties or franchise fees you just
32:13 unless you want to keep the name because
32:15 it's a small town they're just going to
32:16 go to the diner if you're the only one
32:18 in town you get to fill that slot if you
32:21 want to take a risk you can create your
32:23 own diner next you know down the street
32:24 and there's a competition situation
32:26 going on but may the best man win right
32:29 when you turn a little tiny company into
32:32 a corporation what happens is you go
32:35 file a piece of paper with your state
32:36 and it gets spread through all 50 states
32:40 or you get to protect your name but what
32:43 you're doing is you're creating a bunch
32:44 of shares and you can arbitrarily make
32:47 one share or you could make a hundred
32:49 shares or you can make a hundred
32:50 thousand shares or a million shares it's
32:51 up to you they don't care the one a
32:54 dollar comes in through the front door
32:56 and let's say you're lucky you have a
32:59 50% margin of cost versus profit so 50
33:03 cents goes to pay for the product that
33:05 you're selling the person in 50 cents
33:06 goes into your bank account as profit
33:09 all right
33:12 well forever how many shares you have
33:15 and there's a lot of complexity with
33:19 shares so let's just say these are full
33:20 ownership shares okay
33:22 let's say you've got 50 shares all right
33:26 you have 50 cents in the bank 50 shares
33:29 50 different people that own 50
33:30 different you know one share a piece
33:31 just to keep it simple well if you were
33:35 to have a what's called a moment of
33:36 liquidity where you actually pay out a
33:38 dividend and let's say that you decide
33:41 to take all 50 Cent's and pay it out as
33:43 a dividend each person gets a penny boom
33:46 boom boom boom and for every time
33:48 someone walks in that door if you choose
33:51 to have a moment of liquidity and give
33:52 away a dividend and you take all the
33:54 money in the bank and you divide it up
33:56 for every penny of a 50% single sale one
34:01 shareholder gets that penny right well
34:04 then the corporation let's say gets
34:06 really popular now you need money to
34:10 expand and so you bring on more
34:12 shareholders you have to go back and
34:15 refile your your dilution which means
34:18 how many shares do you have in your
34:19 company you go from 50 shares in your
34:20 company 50,000 shares and then one bank
34:24 buys 10,000 shares and other bank buys
34:26 20,000 shares but in return for getting
34:28 those shares they're buying your stocks
34:30 stock options at a certain price let's
34:33 say you raise one hundred million
34:34 dollars so you're expanding your
34:36 business you're opening up new chains
34:38 franchises around the country now the
34:41 per second profit starts to go up
34:44 boom boom boom and at first it's totally
34:47 cool those people who enjoy those
34:49 dividends are getting paid a lot more
34:51 often and a lot more money even though
34:54 their percentage of the company that
34:56 they own has gone down tremendously it's
34:59 one ten-thousandth of the company that
35:01 they used to own they're still making a
35:04 tremendous amount of money I should say
35:06 one one-thousandth right but and what's
35:09 interesting is this they could stop if
35:12 you ran your company you could stop at
35:14 any one point in time and say this is
35:15 how big we're getting we're not getting
35:17 any bigger but the problem is is another
35:20 corporation is going to come around see
35:22 your formula and go Wow
35:24 this this company figured it out but
35:27 they only have like 20 20 franchises
35:30 across 50 states so we have 30 states
35:32 that don't have a single instance of
35:34 this business solution right what if its
35:38 business cards let's say well there's
35:40 still a demand for business cards
35:42 believe it or not at all 50 states let's
35:45 say we're not using the Internet to
35:47 solve the problem so they go well geez
35:49 we'll just open it up bigger and larger
35:51 copy their formula and we'll crush those
35:54 guys so they start to open up a couple
35:58 chains
35:58 ooh now you're looking at them and
36:00 you're going oh my god we're being
36:03 copied your shareholders demand because
36:07 they're a part owner in your company
36:08 they have a little bit of voting powder
36:09 power they actually demand hey we need
36:15 to expand fast okay so you have a board
36:19 meeting and you say look guys there's
36:21 the board that actually comes in and
36:22 manage the money they say our
36:24 shareholders want us to make sure that
36:26 we don't lose out to these competitors
36:28 and the shareholders are the board of
36:31 directors which is sort of like your
36:32 business people have done this several
36:34 times that helped manage the money they
36:35 go what we're going to need to raise a
36:37 billion dollars do you really want to do
36:39 this right and keep that competitor from
36:41 ever touching us because if we want to
36:44 expand in all 50 states and all major
36:46 cities in all 50 states we're going to
36:49 need to open up you know 5,000
36:54 storefronts brick-and-mortar store
36:56 fronts so you have to go find a billion
36:59 dollars from somewhere perhaps you find
37:02 it in little you know five hundred five
37:05 hundred million there 200 million there
37:06 you're dragging it out of banks and they
37:09 all have different demands and so you
37:10 have to keep refiling with the state
37:12 more share dilution right so everyone
37:15 owns less and less of a share you're
37:18 going to make it up and volume so when
37:20 you used to make a penny for every penny
37:21 earned
37:23 you're making a tiny fraction of a
37:26 single penny
37:26 but there's more pennies coming in per
37:28 second and so it kind of makes up
37:30 overtime right so let's take our
37:33 scenario a little bit further just like
37:35 we did in the pollak Politics episode
37:36 you
37:37 get to the point where you've expanded
37:39 into every geographical market you
37:40 possibly can
37:41 you've gone into foreign country so this
37:43 is the game that apples been playing
37:45 lately you know when they couldn't sell
37:47 any more products to the current
37:49 customer base because the innovation
37:51 died with Steve Jobs they captured China
37:54 market which is a little gimme who can
37:56 do one time when China was completely
37:59 infiltrated to the extent that Apple
38:01 could do it with their overpriced
38:03 products Android moved in and cleaned
38:06 them out shrinking shrinking market
38:08 share now in that new expanded market
38:10 what did they do they went to India
38:11 grabbed the tiny bit of that country
38:14 that can afford their overpriced
38:15 telephones well what happens I can't
38:18 read walked in and killed them so this
38:20 game that Tim cooks when playing with
38:21 Apple is over they have to make better
38:24 products and they have to make them
38:26 cheaper all right so back to our example
38:30 we have put up every single
38:32 brick-and-mortar store that we possibly
38:33 can to saw our little business cards the
38:35 only thing we can do at that point well
38:39 there's two things you can do okay the
38:41 first thing you might try to do is
38:42 increase the amount of products that
38:43 people can buy from you that's not just
38:45 business cards anymore it's post cards
38:48 its letterhead it's everything to do
38:50 with a business and paper perhaps you
38:53 just sell paper so you expand your
38:55 portfolio your book of services your
38:57 book of products your catalogue gets
38:58 bigger now all of a sudden you're
39:00 selling all kinds of stuff as variable
39:02 margins right make a lot of money on one
39:04 product not much on the other but again
39:06 it's all profit that's coming in the
39:07 company and the shareholders are happy
39:09 you no longer have to borrow any money
39:11 in fact maybe you're amassing money in
39:13 your bank account all right looks pretty
39:17 good now the shareholders have dividends
39:23 they get paid right they have a value to
39:25 their stock they can actually buy a home
39:28 and borrow it against the value of a
39:30 stock the average value of a stock so
39:32 the stock for 100 bucks a share and they
39:34 have $500,000 worth of that chair I'm
39:38 sorry that stock they can go buy a home
39:42 and literally put their stocks in as the
39:46 collateral against against the loan and
39:49 they just pray to God
39:50 the stock doesn't crash because then the
39:52 bank will call them and say this is no
39:53 longer valid collateral we're going to
39:55 have to have either more collateral
39:57 we're going to foreclose on this loan
39:59 you know you pay it off down to the
40:01 point of where your stock is valued
40:03 right CEO five hundred grand your stock
40:06 was worth five hundred grand and now
40:08 it's only worth 250 the bank might come
40:10 in so you need to put in 250 to us
40:12 because the we don't own any risk right
40:17 well there's this natural point as you
40:20 might see coming where a due diligence
40:22 group comes in and says look we need to
40:25 be able to provide the exact same
40:27 services but way cheaper then we
40:31 currently sell them at or started way
40:33 cheaper than we currently manufacture
40:34 them at so we want to keep our price
40:36 right where it is we're going to get a
40:38 paper from from China make it cheaper
40:42 because we would like to report earnings
40:47 year over year to constantly grow
40:51 because this is this sort of myopic view
40:57 that colleges teach people who get into
41:01 MBAs corporate management so what starts
41:07 happening at that point the second
41:10 someone comes in and tries to build a
41:12 product cheaper in almost every scenario
41:15 they have to build it out of flimsier
41:19 product line if you had a nice you know
41:23 twelve pound stock card and someone says
41:26 well we never promised the stock of the
41:29 card now people love us because our
41:30 cards are beautiful they have round
41:32 edges they're really nice and they seem
41:35 to last forever they're waterproof or
41:37 been proof whatever and you start
41:40 creating an 8-pound stock 10-pound stock
41:43 and then you no longer bevel the edges
41:46 or sorry round off the edges
41:47 everything that becomes the that was the
41:50 trademark of the reason why you bought
41:51 it starts to disappear and as the market
41:55 matures and changes and perhaps you know
41:58 colors business cards are the the new
42:00 trend and beveling and embossing and all
42:02 this other kind of stuff
42:04 becomes popular and little tiny
42:05 mom-and-pop shops are able to crank out
42:07 those cards glossy print versus math
42:09 print you now have a bunch of people at
42:14 the tippy tippy top of the corporation
42:16 that are trying to squeeze every single
42:18 penny out of everything that's there and
42:21 you went from this incredibly innovative
42:24 solution to now the bottom of the barrel
42:27 because you can get a better card
42:29 anywhere and the only reason why anyone
42:32 buys your shitty cards is because you
42:33 have a price point that's maybe slightly
42:36 even more aggressive as the competition
42:39 moves in you might be able to lower your
42:41 price because you've been able to
42:42 increase your marginal profit from 50
42:44 cents to 75 cents because you're using
42:49 shittier products right should your
42:52 materials I should say so that's the
42:54 first stage of how a corporation gets
42:57 upside-down with the quality of their
43:01 product by following these ridiculous
43:03 paradigms that lack any level of pride
43:08 and I'm going to tell you right now that
43:10 as a human being pride is something that
43:13 you know biblically speaking we're not
43:14 supposed to have personal pride which
43:16 means really arrogance right ego gets
43:19 thrown into that but you go isn't really
43:21 a bias of how you treat anyone arrogance
43:24 is an ego that is out of control
43:27 right a level of confidence that is
43:30 absurd you know now some point in man's
43:36 manufacturing history and anomaly
43:39 occurred they made a product and it had
43:43 a flaw and it was actually sort of an
43:48 acceptable flaw the product worked for
43:51 quite a few years a customer is pretty
43:53 satisfied with the product but something
43:56 sort of went out on the product right
44:00 with cars it's one of these things of
44:03 like a clutch can't last forever and
44:05 everyone knows a clutch can't last
44:06 forever I last a really long time brakes
44:10 they don't last forever
44:11 they just don't what is a brake you know
44:14 it's the soft material that is either
44:17 pushed out on a drum or squeezed on a
44:19 plate and it's just going to come off
44:21 it's just made of a material that's
44:23 going to come off and eventually you got
44:24 to replace your brakes you don't I'm
44:26 talking about right well the company
44:29 that manufactured these parts usually
44:32 went to the dealership to get it all for
44:34 quite a while and now we have Pep Boys
44:35 and a bunch of other you know O'Reilly
44:39 parts and we do it ourselves so we have
44:42 little tiny mom-and-pop shops do the
44:44 maintenance for our vehicles at much
44:46 much reduced cost in the dealership and
44:49 they realized organically that there was
44:52 this great opportunity to replace parts
44:55 interesting and someone deviously
45:01 crossed over from that hey let's make
45:04 everything cost less into the camp of
45:07 maintenance and said you mean to tell me
45:11 that this product fails and people
45:14 aren't the slightest bit worried about
45:16 the failure they're willing to pay for
45:18 the replacement and they as long as we
45:20 can tell them at the mechanic
45:22 you know auto parts store that this is a
45:24 normal level of attrition based on just
45:27 operating this particular object this
45:29 vehicle or whatever but they're going to
45:31 pay for the replacement without any
45:34 complaints and as soon as the answer
45:38 came back yes sir that is that is
45:40 absolutely the truth the spawn plain
45:43 obsolescence the game of play at planned
45:47 obsolescence has to do with a
45:51 psychological conditioning of humanity
45:53 to believe that there's nothing wrong
45:57 such that when they part with their
45:59 monetary units as a result of their
46:01 calorie input into some job they're not
46:04 upset and that was the first stage of
46:08 planned obsolescence right build
46:11 something that can't last forever and
46:14 that has to be replaced now it's funny
46:17 about it sometimes it's a vehicle and
46:19 it's all those little parts of shocks
46:20 the struts the belts all that good stuff
46:23 can't even keep your oil forever right
46:26 even though in the 50s according to Stan
46:27 Myers they did figure out how to keep
46:29 the oil
46:30 how to treat metal with oil such that
46:33 the metal never needed to be lubricated
46:34 ever again but that wasn't good for
46:38 business right and then someone took it
46:40 at one step further in a act of devilish
46:44 genius they said well how much pain will
46:50 they endure before they lose product
46:53 loyalty meaning they're pissed off that
46:56 this thing doesn't last that long but as
46:58 long as the auto parts store who's
47:00 generating a profit from selling their
47:02 replacement hey it's not their fault
47:04 they didn't design the car they're just
47:06 selling apart but it's a big cash cow
47:08 you know a brake pads are a huge cash
47:11 cow for auto parts store belt kits or
47:14 huge cash cow well are they going to
47:16 talk down about the manufacturers maybe
47:19 a little but not much if someone were to
47:23 fat guy from the Apple Genius Bar is
47:27 talking to some housewife and he says
47:29 you know you ma'am you can't expect your
47:30 computer lasts more than two years even
47:32 though you paid 3500 bucks for a laptop
47:35 she might say oh well I'm not an
47:38 engineer I don't know I have no
47:40 experience in buying computers year over
47:42 year for three decades so this sounds
47:44 like I just need to adjust my
47:45 expectations and the devious [ __ ] who
47:50 plans obsolescence gets to collect more
47:55 profit off of ignorance right but at the
47:58 expense of not only their corporation
48:01 having more longevity right you know in
48:04 this cut in this world I should say they
48:07 they only care about keeping you
48:09 they only care about taking care of
48:10 anything for them for the amount of time
48:12 that they're personally going to be in
48:14 the company and invested in the company
48:15 right if someone says hey I'm only going
48:18 to be at Apple for ten years and then
48:20 I'm bailing but then they're they're
48:22 just going to try to squeeze as much out
48:24 in ten years before the cash out all
48:26 their stocks and leave they don't have
48:29 any responsibility to the product which
48:31 is why when you lose the head of a
48:32 corporation a Steve Jobs some other CEO
48:37 that you respect out of a company it
48:39 immediately starts to go down the tubes
48:41 because everyone else is just a bunch of
48:43 vultures there
48:44 bunch of piranhas trying to bite off of
48:46 what you have labored to put in the
48:48 company right what's always fascinated
48:52 me about corporations is that once a
48:55 corporation moves up from the bottom to
48:57 the top like a Microsoft who has had you
49:03 know they had sort of a stranglehold on
49:05 ms-dos which again was completely
49:07 developed by IBM I just had things like
49:11 23 commands added to it but everyone
49:14 thinks that Bill Gates invented das
49:16 right
49:18 unbelievably ignorant and I believe his
49:22 father negotiated the deal with IBM to
49:25 give him the the only source code to it
49:28 that it was a lot to be commercially
49:30 resold but they moved to the top by
49:34 copying the Macintosh right because
49:35 Steve Jobs accidentally showed Bill
49:38 Gates the Macintosh before it released
49:40 in order to put the office products on
49:42 there he runs off and creates one does
49:44 1.0 which everyone ignores and then 2.1
49:46 we started finally releasing products on
49:48 it I've been in Windows since 2.1 but
49:52 there was competition there was the
49:54 Macintosh there was the Apple 2 and a
49:57 host of other products like the IBM
50:00 personal computer the PC but eventually
50:03 Windows shows up in 1990 with a pretty
50:07 damn good version of 3.0 and then we had
50:11 the version windows 95 Gil Amelio had
50:15 destroyed Apple after Scully had done it
50:18 his first round of destroying the
50:20 company the guild was unbelievably
50:22 horrible at running that company when
50:25 his 95 comes out and there is no more
50:27 competition
50:28 windows 95 captures cheese what was it
50:31 85 percent of the entire PC market and
50:34 it continued to grow until Apple is down
50:37 to like what three and a half percent or
50:38 something but here's what was very
50:41 interesting about Windows and you see
50:43 this in every single American company
50:46 out there so Windows starts becoming
50:50 this pathetic product it eventually did
50:54 squeeze out windows 98 because the
50:56 jobs came back to Apple Steve Jobs put
50:59 out OS eight which was actually pretty
51:01 excellent and he releases the iMac uh-oh
51:06 Microsoft has competition again for the
51:08 very first time Microsoft's who waited
51:11 until the late 90s to create an internet
51:14 browser to really develop any drivers
51:17 for Windows Touch the Internet itself
51:19 was a joke there was a company called
51:22 Netscape which was owning the world that
51:25 scape made all the web servers Netscape
51:27 was the company that was created by the
51:29 founder of HTTP protocol right who we
51:33 traditionally say was the first person
51:36 to commercialize the Internet which had
51:37 been around since 69 then all of a
51:40 sudden there was healthy competition
51:41 because Apple started kicking ass and
51:42 taking names they did OS nine which was
51:44 a complete piece of [ __ ] but very soon
51:47 after that OS 10 1.0 came out which was
51:49 very nice but didn't have any apps on it
51:51 very quickly every single year they were
51:54 pounding out a new version of OS 10 and
51:57 then Microsoft started slipping right it
51:59 came out Windows 2000 on the biggest
52:01 cluster [ __ ] of all time then Vista to
52:04 follow that up insta was so bad Bill
52:06 Gates left his own company because he
52:08 told him not to release it I've got
52:10 friends that worked at Microsoft while
52:12 Vista was being developed and he said
52:13 that Gates would pace the hallways and
52:16 talk to people and tell them how shitty
52:17 what they were doing was and to and to
52:20 have some some pride in the product but
52:22 the problem was is that they've been
52:24 through those previous stages that we
52:26 just discussed and so they had filled up
52:28 the company with a bunch of people who
52:29 didn't give a [ __ ] they were shaving the
52:32 millimetres off the Taco Bell shelves
52:34 right they didn't give a [ __ ] nor did
52:36 they have the aptitude to give a [ __ ]
52:38 right company takes the first massive
52:42 hit apples blowing up with the freaking
52:44 the iPod and just making billions like
52:48 dozens of billions of dollars every year
52:50 50 billion a year you know and there was
52:54 the iPhone then there was the iPad the
52:56 computers started getting amazing there
52:58 was serious competition so Microsoft
53:01 starts firing people and hiring new
53:02 people and creates finally Windows 7
53:05 which was the first version of Windows
53:07 that was decent since its invention
53:10 consequently promising every year the
53:12 dose is going to disappear underneath
53:13 and it's still here to this day right
53:18 I'm mentioning these specific examples
53:20 for you so you can see the sort of
53:23 genetics of what happens and what you
53:27 need to avoid in two different ways you
53:30 know some of you're going to be
53:31 listening to this video and you will be
53:33 the people that either own a company
53:35 that that is in the middle of this
53:37 process right if you're the CEO you need
53:40 to make sure that you put policies in
53:42 place that can't be vetoed by your
53:45 voting voting shareholders that say this
53:47 is our standard we're not going below
53:50 this standard right
53:51 Nike like you used to be this incredible
53:54 company and then they start having all
53:55 their shoes made in China and they just
53:58 fall apart right the glue just falls
54:00 apart on the shoe but there are other
54:03 shoes that never fall apart and they're
54:06 big brands as well I used to wonder why
54:09 people bought Bentley's and you know
54:12 Porsches and all these other cars he's
54:14 really you know one hundred and twenty
54:15 thousand dollar Mercedes and my box and
54:18 all that kind of stuff right until I sat
54:21 in one and drove one and I realized oh
54:25 these are the you know dozen companies
54:28 in the world that make vehicles that
54:30 hasn't compromised their integrity you
54:34 know it's funny when you watch these
54:36 videos the making of a Bentley it's
54:37 actually fairly interesting or Maserati
54:39 or something like that and they show you
54:40 all these people hand making the
54:42 dashboards you know hand carving the
54:44 wood and and people selling the leather
54:47 together to put over the dashboard all
54:49 that kind of stuff and you think oh my
54:51 god look how amazing that is that's why
54:53 this car cost three hundred thousand
54:55 dollars and then if you're old enough
54:58 like me and you paid attention to
54:59 decades way before you even existed you
55:02 remember America used to do that with
55:04 every single product they ever made
55:06 that's why in my town here in Huntington
55:09 Beach California we have all these car
55:10 shows and what shows up cars from the
55:14 60s and and beyond right so back to like
55:19 the 1915 you know Model T's will show up
55:23 and why is that because they still exist
55:27 it's really have to do a little bit of
55:29 restoration but what you don't see is a
55:31 forward probe you know you don't see a
55:34 Mitsubishi Starion
55:36 you know you don't see these cars that
55:38 were built to fall apart so everything
55:41 being built today is just meant to fall
55:43 apart unless you're buying a premium
55:45 product or you're putting a tremendous
55:46 amount of money into sustaining the
55:48 products life right and just to stay on
55:51 cars for one second you know a lot of
55:53 warranties on on fancy cars you're
55:56 supposed to bring your car in for
55:58 maintenance and you have to pay these
56:01 incredible fees like thirty five hundred
56:03 bucks and what they're doing is they're
56:05 replacing all the parts on the car that
56:07 are built to fall apart and so you have
56:10 these hundred thousand mile warranties
56:11 bumper to bumper but in order to get the
56:13 warranty you have to spend the entire
56:16 purchase price of the car while you're
56:18 paying for the car every month you have
56:19 to buy the car slowly back twice so if
56:23 your car is 80 grand you're going to
56:24 spend a hundred and sixty grand in five
56:27 to seven years on that car they're
56:30 duping us into basically replacing the
56:33 vehicle it's like someone saying you go
56:35 to your doctor and every single time you
56:37 go to the doctor they're literally
56:38 giving you an organ transplant and
56:41 saying well you know boy did a great job
56:43 on your heart did not anything like yeah
56:44 well it's a [ __ ] brand new heart you
56:46 didn't you didn't teach me how to eat
56:49 well and keep my heart healthy you just
56:51 keep replacing the pieces and parts my
56:54 concern is that this entire mindset has
57:00 infected every aspect of our lives it
57:04 isn't just a car purchase it isn't just
57:06 a product purchase if you we build our
57:09 homes cheaply and we fill them with
57:11 cheap products we put cheap clothing on
57:14 we put cheap food in our in our kitchens
57:16 and our bodies we drive treat cheap cars
57:20 you know someone's supposed to be your
57:23 gardener but they don't really do the
57:24 job they just mow your lawn and pile up
57:27 Leafs in every corner of your backyard
57:30 if we settle for those standards because
57:33 we're hiring you know outside help that
57:34 doesn't have any
57:36 standards and we accept the fact that we
57:39 have to pay some exorbitant fee just to
57:42 get normal service now what we're making
57:45 everything in the world cost a lot more
57:47 to get normal services and products
57:50 right but if we join them body and soul
57:54 and we simply say this is the way the
57:57 world is we lose in every single
58:00 category of everything we lose with our
58:03 interpersonal relationships we lose with
58:06 our own management of our own life you
58:09 know I often comment about people that
58:11 don't you know take care of their bodies
58:13 like the Apple guy just talked about
58:15 several times well for me why would you
58:19 take care of your body if you won't take
58:20 care of anything else in your life you
58:22 don't demand any excellence in your life
58:24 whatsoever where does excellence and
58:27 perfectionism ever ever exist in one's
58:30 life if one doesn't demand it exists at
58:33 some point in their life right I'll give
58:36 you a little low hanging fruit example
58:37 of which I'm almost certain each one of
58:41 you has experienced personally some of
58:44 you will make it better every single day
58:46 and some of you won't some of you will
58:49 clean your bathroom once a week some of
58:51 you won't those of you that make you
58:53 better every day and clean your bathroom
58:55 at some regiment I'm not talking about
58:57 you and believe me I'm not holier than
59:01 thou in any way shape or form and let me
59:04 just pick on myself for a second I work
59:09 24/7 seven days a week and that's the
59:12 way I love it right and so at some point
59:16 I'll refresh the bedding and I have a
59:19 really busy busy week and I'm hopping
59:20 out of bed really quickly and I'm not
59:22 making it and I'm taking old clothes off
59:25 and putting it on one side of the bed
59:27 because I need to put this here and I
59:28 need to hang this up I don't have time
59:30 in my own brain don't think I have time
59:31 and it starts to become a cluster right
59:34 the bathroom I'm supposed to clean it on
59:37 Sunday morning or Sunday afternoon but
59:39 this particular Sunday I was out and
59:40 about and I was driving over LA and I
59:43 miss it and then I go back into my busy
59:45 week and I don't have any Pablo Nyan
59:47 training to clean my bathroom
59:49 between Monday and Saturday so if I slip
59:52 one more time the bathroom starts
59:54 looking like [ __ ] the bin it all comes
59:58 back around I do the cleaning it's good
60:01 the bag gets refreshed and it gets me
60:03 all of a sudden I feel good it's bizarre
60:07 the chaos of my house has been subdued I
60:11 feel good about my own ability to clean
60:14 the place up when I crawl into brandy
60:16 sheets every night holy [ __ ] it's an
60:18 amazing experience you all know what
60:20 it's like to hop into hotel bedding
60:21 right that's good what I don't want to
60:24 admit to myself is that when I let it
60:26 turn into a crap house
60:28 right it affects me negatively I take
60:32 the chaos of my bathroom the chaos of my
60:34 room the chaos of whatever you know my
60:37 office my front room or whatever if I
60:40 don't get a chance to wash my car once a
60:42 week and I'm taking this beautiful
60:44 vehicle to a meeting I'm parking a
60:47 little further away from the front door
60:48 I shouldn't be doing that I should
60:52 adhere to a level of perfectionism that
60:55 is an obsessive it's not crazy but it
60:58 meets the bare minimum standards to make
61:00 me feel comfortable as a person there's
61:03 that old saying do you want to others as
61:04 you would have them do unto you now in
61:07 several areas of life that doesn't work
61:08 I like people being honest with me and
61:11 being truthful there's a lot of there's
61:15 a lot of folks out there that hate the
61:17 truth because they've allowed a lot of
61:21 things to be swept under the rug
61:23 and the truth starts to enter their life
61:25 then they're afraid that other things
61:26 are going to be exposed in their life we
61:30 can't allow that to infect ourselves
61:32 when it comes to product manufacturing
61:35 and services that we offer if we treat
61:38 these products and services as if they
61:41 are services that we are offering to
61:43 ourselves or to our loved ones or
61:46 someone we're trying to impress we're
61:49 going to be in a great situation a lot
61:52 of you guys and gals have been in
61:53 situations where you are trying to
61:55 impress someone on a romantic level
61:56 right and you will go to no there will
62:01 be no extent that you won't go to ski
62:03 me to impress that person all right for
62:08 guys you know I don't know some some
62:11 beautiful girl calls you up and says you
62:13 know I'm having problem with my TV I
62:15 don't know how to program and I'm having
62:16 a problem with my car my car is so dirty
62:19 and you know it's just manly [ __ ] they
62:21 don't have a man in their life and so
62:22 you're like alright but when are you
62:24 available I'll come over we'll have a
62:26 good afternoon together I'll pick up
62:28 your car I'll take care of it and man
62:30 you meticulously [ __ ] clean this
62:32 thing or whatever the hell you're doing
62:34 you fix their pipes or whatever and you
62:39 turn it in and there you feel amazing
62:42 that you've got the skills and
62:43 capability of doing it the meticulous
62:45 nature of everything you you realize
62:47 that they may not consciously realize
62:48 that you've put that effort in but they
62:50 will subconsciously definitely notice
62:52 how meticulous you were what you did and
62:57 I haven't found a lady that's not
62:59 attracted to a guy that's got
63:00 capabilities right let alone the
63:04 temerity to to prioritize them right I
63:09 have to assume that the Japanese have
63:13 that pride you know there was all the
63:17 documentaries in the 80s about how
63:18 Toyota had managed to come out of
63:20 nowhere I should say Japanese cars
63:23 shouldn't just tell you to take all the
63:26 trophy there but there were these
63:28 documentaries about how they train their
63:30 staff to give a [ __ ] and when they
63:32 brought their factories to the United
63:33 States they had a hard time teaching
63:35 Americans who had for the last 15 to 20
63:38 years been taught obsolescence to say
63:43 we're going to build Corollas here we're
63:45 going to build Camrys and civics here
63:48 but if we're going to build them here
63:50 you have to build into our standards you
63:54 know I work with a woman for two years
63:56 who formerly used to work at Toyota and
63:58 Mexico and she said that the the worst
64:01 problem they had Mexico was that they
64:03 had never seen these standards ever in
64:05 their lifetime they never built anything
64:06 as complex as a car before in any mass
64:10 you know market manner and so they had
64:14 employees stealing parts
64:17 from the from the company because in
64:20 their brain that was a standard that was
64:22 okay well you have you have too much and
64:25 I don't have anything and so you know
64:28 the average employee in Mexico makes
64:29 $500 a month it doesn't matter what you
64:32 do only a doctor starts piercing the
64:35 $500 a month thing that Mexico lets
64:40 these people like we only pay me 500
64:41 bucks I'm going to steal a part that's
64:43 worth 500 bucks and look a thousand
64:44 bucks they almost had to shut down a
64:47 couple factories down in fact in fact
64:49 they did shut down a Toyota factory down
64:52 there secretly for for a couple months I
64:56 mean people are getting paid they
64:58 weren't making any cars because they
65:00 were trying to figure out a way to
65:01 secure the storage facilities hire armed
65:04 guards to make sure the employees
65:06 weren't stealing stuff it's just because
65:08 their society is different than ours
65:10 right one of the biggest concerns about
65:15 allowing immigrants into a country is
65:19 the Constitution not the the law the
65:24 legislation the Constitution but the
65:26 actual inner Constitution of a human
65:28 being is coming into your country let's
65:31 say that you have a country and you your
65:35 people fought very hard to create your
65:37 country that to fight for the borders I
65:39 mean literally fight for every square
65:41 foot up to the border fence that goes
65:43 into the next country right or the
65:45 border line right and then you you feel
65:50 sorry for some other country it has a
65:53 bunch of people that don't fight for
65:55 their country every single time their
65:58 tyrannical government pushed on them
65:59 they said how much and now you say well
66:03 wow I really feel sorry for those folks
66:04 and instead of helping them fix their
66:06 own country and giving them whatever
66:07 they need to fight back whether it be
66:09 education whether it be brute force you
66:14 bring them into your country and your
66:16 idea is that somehow without any formal
66:19 education I mean they may learn every
66:21 capital in your country every 50 states
66:23 which is great because most kids in
66:25 America don't know where all the 50
66:26 states are they come in
66:29 and they're not willing to fight they
66:31 never learned how to fight for what was
66:33 rightfully theirs and let's say they
66:35 come right through the immigration
66:36 process they say they literally go
66:38 through the process formally they're not
66:39 sneaking in the back door but what that
66:42 does is that undermines the the backbone
66:45 of the country that you live in because
66:49 as soon as the banking cartel starts to
66:52 push on the politicians to steal
66:54 everything and hand it over to
66:56 corporations they're going to behave
66:57 just like we talked about in this
66:59 episode they know that they have an
67:02 exponentially greater odd of succeeding
67:05 because the backbone slashed the
67:08 population that lives in that region is
67:09 now no longer the population that fought
67:13 to create the country in the first place
67:16 they're now extremely docile they're
67:20 serfs the people that will say oh okay
67:24 you need to take away everything that's
67:25 mine
67:26 I've become an indentured servant to the
67:28 state or to the plantation sure that's
67:31 what I that's what I know
67:32 Wow it's becoming like my my home
67:35 country that I wouldn't fight for man if
67:37 you won't fire for the land you're born
67:38 on and live on you have no business
67:41 moving anywhere else right but that
67:45 person okay hey we'll just move to the
67:47 next country it has a backbone until
67:50 they infect that place and then they
67:52 tear it down and they keep moving around
67:53 till everything is taken over right and
67:57 then you fill me on this we're at a
68:00 point in history and 2017 here early
68:04 summer
68:05 I guess we're technically still in
68:06 spring perhaps Cassie Atkins were in
68:08 April let the borders of the world are
68:11 being eroded and it's all being sold
68:16 under this sort of suffering you know
68:20 backstory which is completely untrue
68:25 and we're losing our nation-states we're
68:27 losing our identity as individuals every
68:31 time we accept let's say an immigrant
68:33 from another country this episode is not
68:35 about immigration but it's very
68:36 important because we're kind of on the
68:38 point of the the the byproduct of losing
68:42 a good government is that corporations
68:45 take over anytime you take in an
68:48 immigrant from a country that's got
68:49 problems you're allowing the problem to
68:52 persist so when you think you're doing
68:54 some in a favor you're actually doing
68:56 them two negatives you know if we had a
68:59 mechanism where we would recognize
69:01 what's missing in the individual that's
69:03 coming over and we literally put them in
69:05 some sort of rehabilitation the only in
69:08 product that we'd want would be to send
69:10 them back in to their own country and
69:11 say now you know what freedom feels like
69:13 now you know what tyranny is and now you
69:17 know every single method that's ever
69:20 been used in history to turn a country
69:22 that's tyrannically dominated by a few
69:25 into the beautiful free country that's
69:28 dominated and run by the many America
69:31 has to get it [ __ ] together because we
69:35 set a standard in world history for
69:37 quality products and what we're known
69:39 for in this country is imagination
69:41 invention but we've had at least one
69:46 generation if not two generations
69:48 completely eroded from having any
69:50 imagination at all I will say in the
69:54 last six months or so I've met a lot of
69:56 the gen Z kids and I believe that
69:59 there's a lot of hope is I mean there's
70:01 a lot I shouldn't say hope there's
70:02 really concrete evidence that these kids
70:05 are sick and tired of the [ __ ] yes
70:08 several of them are social social
70:10 justice warriors but I want to make sure
70:12 you understand the number of them is
70:15 greatly exaggerated right there's a tiny
70:18 fraction of a single percent of human
70:21 beings in the United States of America
70:22 that actually identify with social
70:25 justice warriors the rest of them are
70:28 like shut the [ __ ] up get back to school
70:31 get back to your job get a good
70:34 education and stop bitching and moaning
70:36 and whining
70:38 that's the majority of jimsy and my all
70:40 my experience right and I reach out to
70:43 all kinds of different arteries to find
70:45 these groups and see what they're doing
70:47 you know we the amount of young females
70:51 and their teens right now grabbing
70:53 electric guitars and slaying these
70:56 [ __ ] things is unbelievable that's a
70:59 good sign
71:00 because these kids have iPhones
71:02 Playstations and they choose not to play
71:04 around on them they've got Facebook and
71:06 Instagram and all this other horseshit
71:08 and they choose to practice an
71:10 instrument to imbue into themselves a
71:12 talent that can never be taken away like
71:14 a degree that's going to turn into a
71:17 really amazing cultural bubble if we can
71:20 just protect it you know yeah I feel
71:24 like I could talk about this forever and
71:25 ever and ever but I won't torture you
71:27 any further your homework is analyze
71:31 your own life analyze where this sort of
71:34 planned obsolescence has infected your
71:37 personal opinion of what's acceptable in
71:40 the products that you purchase because
71:42 my guess is that if you're like me
71:45 you've been had
71:47 you know I'm an inventor and so and I'm
71:52 an engineer and an architect and so for
71:54 me I am here to make products that
71:56 people admire and say Jesus he made that
72:00 10-15 years ago and it still works to
72:02 this day and all the promises of you
72:06 know maintenance not being necessary or
72:08 if it needs to be augmented in any way
72:10 shape or form I didn't have to hire
72:11 people at $160 an hour I could hire guys
72:13 at forty bucks an hour because it's
72:17 well-made it's well document and that
72:18 kind of stuff see if there's anything
72:21 you can do in your life to inject that
72:24 sort of sensibility into humanity and
72:26 you know what you don't have to be a
72:28 part of a big corporation let's say
72:29 you're a carpenter let's say that you're
72:31 a chef whatever it is you do there's
72:34 some little tiny contribution you can
72:35 make to society and most of you have
72:37 several these things in your life anyway
72:39 you go to a potluck and you bring your
72:41 grandma's you know famous dish or you
72:44 help your buddy next door maintenance
72:46 this car because you know how to replace
72:47 brake pads and you're saving them five
72:49 hundred bucks in labor
72:51 in the end it just feels better to do
72:54 that kind of stuff anyway right you're
72:55 going to get back what you put out but
72:58 this is a way that we get to commune as
72:59 a society right to hold hands in terms
73:03 of our appreciation for each other you
73:07 know and I do want to put a footnote on
73:09 this the immigrants that come to at
73:11 least America in most cases are ready to
73:13 work their asses off and they do an
73:15 amazing job so I'm not anti-immigrant I
73:18 just feel like the kind that sneaked
73:20 over the borders and bring tons of drugs
73:22 and and we'll go through the formal
73:24 process I don't believe that that's
73:27 healthy and I believe that if we're
73:31 going to run around the Middle East and
73:32 try to dictate how their country should
73:35 work and what financial systems they
73:36 should use we need to take care of our
73:38 at least our brothers to the south you
73:40 know but we know there's deep state
73:43 organized organizations that don't want
73:45 that to happen again once we made fake
73:50 news stick out like a sore thumb we all
73:52 saw it for the first time it's like my
73:54 analogy and the episodes you know
73:56 several episodes back where my buddy
73:58 told me about golfing and he said you
73:59 know when someone loses a ball in the
74:01 rough all four guys go out and look for
74:04 the ball and no one can see it and so
74:07 one person says oh there it is and once
74:09 they point their finger at it I don't
74:12 know what happens in the society
74:13 inserting the consciousness of the
74:15 universe but all three minds that aren't
74:17 looking at the ball all of a sudden can
74:19 see the ball because it's been exposed
74:23 right it's like the little boy who said
74:25 the Emperor didn't have any clothes on
74:28 what people had convinced themselves
74:30 that that he did have clothes on because
74:32 they're like bullshitting themselves and
74:34 it took a child to simply call it the
74:36 obvious we need to be that kid because
74:40 we need to call a bunch of [ __ ] out and
74:42 it's going to be fun it's going to
74:44 create a bunch of rewarding work for all
74:46 of us to fix all these issues it will
74:48 right I mean imagine someone said
74:52 imagine giving a little scenario here
74:54 for those of you who play like
74:56 post-apocalyptic video games like
74:58 fallout or you've heard these you know
75:00 these zombie stories like a Walking Dead
75:02 you know the whole world's off it's all
75:04 been turned off
75:05 electricity you have these little
75:07 fantasies if you're like me of like well
75:09 what would it be like if we were to go
75:10 back into Detroit get it you know you
75:13 get all the zombies killed off right
75:14 everyone is like alive hopefully we all
75:17 turn into zombies in this particular
75:18 scenario like a fallout you've got some
75:20 people that are corrupt but you get rid
75:22 of all the corruption or you create
75:23 secure pockets of areas where it's not
75:26 going to be okay and we want cars again
75:29 and we have to go to Detroit and figure
75:31 that [ __ ] out none of us made cars we
75:33 don't know how the robots work on the
75:35 assembly lines work but there's manuals
75:37 everywhere we can turn on switches off
75:39 and on what's that do on that thing oh
75:41 if that's how you turn it on okay cool
75:44 the idea is we would have a lot of pride
75:47 and even though the work was
75:50 unbelievable to turn society back on a
75:52 lot of us dudes and gals we would
75:55 actually enjoy every single second of it
75:58 because we're making a difference right
76:00 we're turning back on the the
76:03 accomplishments that we have worked tens
76:05 of thousands of years all the sciences
76:07 stacks up on science to make computers
76:10 work again imagine I didn't apocalyptic
76:13 thing happening and you have no
76:14 electronic devices at all you couldn't
76:16 listen to an album that she peddled a
76:19 bike a little generator or something you
76:22 don't do that forever eventually need to
76:24 turn on the power plants I had a really
76:26 great session about a year ago with some
76:28 buddies of mine that do power plant
76:30 design and manufacturing and I said we
76:33 went to the scenario of some sort of
76:36 post-apocalyptic thing happening and my
76:39 buddy turned to me and he said he says
76:41 don't worry that ever happens we'll get
76:45 those factories turned back on don't
76:47 worry we know how to do it
76:48 we'll get the water turned back on we'll
76:50 get power turned back on we'll replace
76:51 and repair everything that needs to be
76:53 fixed we'll get it done and it was the
76:56 most heartwarming
76:57 badass comment I heard in a really long
76:59 time I was like yeah cool and I'll do
77:02 everything I can and to learn what I
77:04 need to learn to do what I do to turn
77:06 what I know back on to but it's also not
77:10 all exterior some of its interior we
77:13 need to learn how to be nice again to
77:15 people we need to learn how to
77:17 be sort of the goofy guys that we were
77:20 back in the 40s right men were men but
77:24 they were also kind of you know they
77:26 just didn't conceive of death and
77:28 destruction the way that it's been
77:29 pushed on us today by all the terrorism
77:31 and [ __ ] from our intelligence
77:33 agencies right
77:35 the amount of horrific [ __ ] that's
77:37 broadcast into a household today is
77:38 insane isn't it we've learned to accept
77:41 it again seventh season of Walking Dead
77:45 first episode horrific and that was
77:48 broadcast into people's homes people
77:49 paid for that service to watch that show
77:52 and they huddled around the TV to push
77:56 it into their brain and when it's
77:58 imagery you should never have to see in
78:01 your entire lifetime so we're doing
78:04 ourselves any favors I think not all
