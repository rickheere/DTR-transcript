00:14 so
00:20 [Music]
00:27 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen slightly warmer today
00:39 i'm very happy 47
00:42 no weather so nice up smoking a nice uh
00:46 fuente
00:47 natural 85.8 all right
00:50 as you might have suspected and as i
00:53 promised a couple times
00:56 i am going to do the redo the mission to
00:58 mars
00:59 hoax episode
01:03 and then we'll retire that one back in
01:04 season one of course i'll probably
01:06 forget to do that so both will be up for
01:08 a couple years
01:10 so now we just redid the one about the
01:15 fake moon landing hoax
01:18 now that one was way easier believe it
01:20 or not that one is a cinch
01:23 it's a cinch because we have tons and
01:25 tons of evidence
01:26 multiple missions the mistakes were so
01:30 bad
01:30 the science was so bad
01:33 it's just like low-hanging fruit but
01:36 this one we have to take a slightly
01:37 different tactic
01:39 this is all about the odds of
01:42 what has been recorded as history
01:46 which we all know is the matrix don't we
01:49 we know that if you pay taxes in a
01:51 country
01:52 that's considered a first rule country
01:54 especially
01:56 that we're buying a lot of stuff that we
01:58 would never buy and never approve of
02:00 if we knew what we were buying and
02:03 that's typically
02:05 wasteful spending
02:08 which america does ridiculous amounts of
02:13 and then there are evil things that we
02:16 pay for
02:17 and those are just too much to name war
02:20 things are in there
02:22 with a space program it's interesting
02:26 the space programs they they get at us
02:29 at a deeper level don't they
02:31 because we're sitting there thinking all
02:33 right well
02:34 getting off this planet safely flying
02:37 through space
02:38 safely getting to anywhere else within
02:40 our time
02:42 you know our lifespan i should say
02:45 it's tough if if regardless of what
02:48 we've actually accomplished we know that
02:49 that's a tough thing it's going to take
02:51 the smartest people on the planet to
02:52 pull it off
02:54 and depending on when you contemplate
02:56 this you may already be past the
02:57 formative years where you're going to
02:59 participate in such a thing
03:02 and so you're kind of like okay well
03:04 that's not me because i'm this other
03:06 expert in something else
03:07 or just you know you can be an average
03:10 person be an expert it's all good
03:13 and so we just sort of in our brains
03:15 compartmentalize that away and say well
03:17 just show me
03:18 if we're going to be doing this you're
03:22 going to be spending my tax dollars
03:23 show me kind of what we're doing here
03:25 you know
03:27 it would be a really good idea to watch
03:29 the moon hoax one before you watch this
03:31 one
03:33 it's just a few episodes back in the
03:35 520s
03:37 because the mars one i think evolved
03:40 out of the business model that they
03:45 discovered with the moon hoax
03:49 what's the deal with the moon hoax right
03:51 moon hoax
03:53 as we asserted in that episode is real
03:55 simple
03:56 they wanted werner von braun to make
03:58 missiles that then they were going to
04:00 juice up to intercontinental ballistic
04:02 missiles
04:04 and that was the reason why they gave
04:05 him a pass at nurenberg and didn't kill
04:08 the guy
04:09 because man did people die as a result
04:12 of that situation
04:13 nope this guy gets cleaned he's on the
04:15 disney channel by the mid 50s
04:17 he's an absolute treasure i think he got
04:20 fired and just right after two years
04:22 after the last mission he dies in 77.
04:26 you know he warns his secretary
04:27 supposedly according to her she's got a
04:29 phd
04:30 she seems a bit like an attention person
04:32 kind of thing but i don't mean to be
04:34 disparaging it just she seems like that
04:36 kind of person
04:37 but she says that he told her hey beware
04:40 they're already working on a fake alien
04:41 invasion
04:43 on our planet but what was the
04:47 business model the business model was
04:49 claim something you're not doing
04:51 make that fakery of what you're claiming
04:54 much cheaper
04:56 even if it costs millions of dollars
04:57 make it much cheaper
04:59 than what you're claiming and then rack
05:01 up the money
05:03 to rinse and repeat this now of course
05:06 coming up the first saturn 5 platform
05:09 all the testing all the collaboration
05:11 around the world
05:13 definitely cost a tremendous amount of
05:15 money but it's the
05:17 repeat apollo 12 and up is where they're
05:20 gonna make all their dough
05:22 but what would have been the post-mortem
05:25 conversation
05:27 about a bunch of liars
05:30 coming up with this scam
05:33 looking at looking backwards and and you
05:35 know again they know all the stuff they
05:37 screwed up
05:39 i'm sure that however exhaustive my two
05:42 hour six minute episode i did on the
05:44 moon hoax
05:45 was just recently even if all of it was
05:48 accurate
05:49 completely the real inaccuracies that
05:52 are blatantly in front of their face
05:54 because they made the mistakes is
05:55 probably a list that's
05:57 10 times bigger so they're kind of
05:59 sitting on a honey thing they're like
06:01 okay man you know it's like
06:04 we have a great idea here to sell
06:07 space missions to the inhabitants of our
06:11 country slash a planet
06:14 scoop a ton of money off make them feel
06:16 amazing inspire kids to get into science
06:18 so they
06:18 maybe want to one day actually pull this
06:20 thing off
06:22 but the liability of screwing up
06:25 something
06:26 is heavy big
06:30 so what we need to do is figure out a
06:32 different method
06:33 to this magic trick that's even easier
06:36 and cheaper
06:38 and has far less liability it's not an
06:41 easy task
06:42 now we know from history they were under
06:46 the mars thing in the 60s
06:49 the first supposed orbital satellite
06:52 around mars was in 1964 by the united
06:55 states government
06:57 okay again
07:01 nasa just can't make any mistakes man
07:04 but we're going to go through the
07:05 details of that because some of you
07:06 might be yelling oh well they tried once
07:08 and they didn't
07:08 work you know whatever we're going to
07:10 get into it
07:12 but here's the platform before we get
07:14 into all the details
07:17 because i told you how they faked the
07:18 moon missions and then i told you all
07:20 the
07:20 facts what is going on in my
07:24 personal belief considering that
07:26 integrity of
07:28 nasa is extremely bad now gpl
07:31 is involved with this it is not
07:34 a fact with that we know
07:38 exactly which groups are doing exactly
07:40 which steps
07:41 but i will tell you from all the you
07:43 know nasa tour videos i've seen all the
07:48 satan worshipping i've seen in that
07:49 those organizations i just
07:51 joking there that the way this works
07:56 is that they figured out that once they
07:58 launch a rocket out of sight
08:01 a very you know believable formidable
08:04 gigantic rocket
08:05 takes off you got to hear the
08:08 the booming of those engines man there's
08:10 nothing like it on planet earth man when
08:12 i saw a space shuttle come up and that
08:13 sound wave finally hit me man
08:15 it's a coolest unique rumbling sound
08:19 that only rockets make you know but once
08:22 they get that thing out of your sight
08:25 they realized and quarantined the
08:28 process they slowed down time
08:31 with probably the moon missions quite
08:32 frankly but they realized you know what
08:36 all we have to do is feed people images
08:38 that's the only thing we could do even
08:40 if we were really doing it
08:42 is to feed them images especially if a
08:44 human being is not coming
08:46 especially if a human being's not coming
08:49 so it's rocket launch out of sight out
08:51 of mind
08:53 virtually no one in the world
08:54 understands rocketry
08:56 and i mean virtually no one at let's say
08:59 we have seven and a half billion
09:01 how many people do you think really
09:02 understand aerospace to the point where
09:04 they could sit and
09:05 explain everything about a rocket the
09:08 factors involved
09:10 so once it's out of sight and out of
09:12 mind the next thing is is we have to
09:14 account for the time
09:16 that the thrusters are supposedly
09:19 accounting for the velocity towards mars
09:24 and we have to just count it out just a
09:26 little bit of like slide ruler math
09:28 right
09:28 and we tell the public okay with these
09:30 boosters with that payload
09:34 it's going to take x number of months to
09:36 get there or a year or whatever
09:38 and then step one step two phase one
09:41 phase two
09:43 you have to simulate to the employees of
09:45 the organizations respectively
09:48 the hoax because you do not want them in
09:49 on it
09:51 again just like the moon missions you
09:52 could interview let's just say there was
09:54 a thousand people involved with the
09:56 launch
09:57 and landing of the saturn v and the
09:59 lunar lander on the moon
10:01 i'm going to say that less than probably
10:03 25 to 50 people knew the truth about the
10:05 situation
10:08 if you haven't seen the moon hoax
10:10 episode this year
10:11 there is a clip that i didn't realize
10:13 until after i inserted it into the
10:16 episode when neil armstrong steps onto
10:20 the moon and they're filming these two
10:21 guys internally
10:22 who definitely know in my opinion this
10:25 thing is fake
10:26 and you know here comes the news back
10:27 that he's fine
10:29 the lunar lander made it safely to the
10:31 surface of the moon and this guy's just
10:33 like
10:34 yeah and then he's like oh okay
10:37 and his buddy's almost like hey we got
10:38 we're supposed to clap here you know
10:39 this is really funny little clip
10:42 that's how i interpret it anyway now the
10:45 other thing is
10:47 if you had a camera really really far
10:49 away
10:50 you know that the
10:53 well especially with 1964 technology
10:57 to probably the 21st century
11:00 the ability to take a picture and send
11:04 it back to earth is going to be
11:07 pretty remedial the kind of camry that
11:09 you would bring
11:10 would be very remedial it would have to
11:12 be a digital camera
11:14 it would what are you gonna do take a
11:17 35 millimeter camera and have a little
11:20 dark
11:20 room on the system so that it can then
11:23 process it and then what film it
11:25 yeah it's gonna be a video camera
11:29 and so we know that video cameras have
11:31 varying resolutions back in the day i
11:32 mean
11:33 a huge tv in the mid 80s was probably
11:37 15 to 19 inches tube television
11:40 it was phosphorus cannon television so
11:44 the pixels were like
11:45 glowing spheres and not or circles i
11:48 should say
11:49 and not the square pixel stuff we have
11:51 today
11:52 so the requirements for them to fake the
11:55 mission and to
11:58 get paid and to convince you
12:01 just went down a lot because with the
12:04 moon missions they're supposedly
12:05 bringing hustle bloods
12:07 color video cameras all kinds of stuff
12:11 and somehow you know they can
12:14 have a conversation with richard nixon
12:17 without any pauses which is something i
12:18 forgot to put in the episode but then
12:20 again i was taking
12:20 notes or reading any notes i should say
12:25 but now here's the interesting thing
12:26 about the mission log
12:28 of all of nasa's attempts to get to mars
12:32 and then our closest competitor russia
12:37 and now china is taking after nasa it's
12:40 absolutely hilarious how the ccp is like
12:42 screw it man we're just as good as nasa
12:44 on the first day
12:46 we don't have precision mechanics and
12:49 that we can't build
12:50 engines for our fake raptors that we
12:53 stole
12:54 the blueprints thanks to obama's
12:56 administration
12:58 we can't build the engines we were going
13:00 to contract them out of europe but
13:01 europe has now been told by the united
13:03 states don't you
13:04 [ __ ] dare to make those engines for
13:06 our
13:07 arch enemy so without precision
13:10 azimuth level mechanical
13:13 construction capabilities man they're on
13:16 the moon now man they got rover there
13:18 they
13:19 film brown dirt no one seems to care
13:22 but they have a cute couple missions
13:24 going to mars now february of 2021 is
13:27 going to be an interesting month of mars
13:29 bs so just brace yourself so let's just
13:34 peruse the mission log shall we
13:37 it might surprise you that the first
13:41 five attempts
13:42 to go to mars was by the soviet union
13:45 from 1960-1962
13:48 three or excuse me four out of five blew
13:51 up on the tarmac
13:52 the fifth well sorry the fourth one
13:54 actually got into space and then they
13:56 had what's called a
13:57 spacecraft failure so then
14:01 obviously nasa's going hey hey we got to
14:03 get in on this scam i mean russia always
14:05 goes first
14:06 then nessa goes second and then they
14:09 just
14:10 almost knocking out the park on their
14:11 first try but they also had a launch
14:13 failure
14:14 now here's what's interesting that's the
14:16 second attempt
14:18 because there's nothing they can do
14:19 about a rocket blowing up on the tarmac
14:21 right can't do anything it blew up in
14:23 front of your face
14:24 first phase of the hoax didn't didn't
14:27 work out so you don't even get to tempt
14:29 the second part of the phase
14:31 but 1964 in november 28th
14:36 nasa launches a rocket that then gets
14:38 out of
14:40 your sight instantaneous success
14:43 it flies by mars wow that's just awesome
14:46 isn't it
14:47 crazy well the russians try again in 64
14:50 themselves but
14:52 they report a spacecraft failure so it
14:55 launches but doesn't work
14:58 but guess who goes next and totally
15:00 succeeds
15:01 nasa 1969
15:04 russians try again launch failure
15:07 doesn't work
15:08 dang it can't get this damn thing in
15:10 space
15:11 nasa tries again poof rockets out of
15:14 your sight
15:15 poof another flyby totally succeed
15:20 russia tries again 1969
15:23 top launch failure
15:27 nasa goes in 1971
15:30 launch failure can't can't have the scam
15:33 sophia's try again
15:34 launch failure god damn it you know
15:37 finally 1971 russia gets one to
15:42 escape your sight boom success
15:45 immediately if you can get your rocket
15:47 to lever it that we're gonna review this
15:49 uh
15:50 in a more fundamental way and we're
15:51 gonna laugh hopefully as soon as the
15:54 thing got out of uh
15:55 sight boom it orbits perfectly
15:59 they do another one of 71 and it's a
16:01 failure
16:02 but now nasa or sorry the soviet union
16:04 is kind of like
16:07 all right i think we got this thing
16:08 launched part and so we're just going to
16:10 start succeeding a lot more
16:12 71 another success we had a partial
16:16 failure
16:18 another 71 from nasa totally succeeds
16:22 on and on down the line soviets are
16:24 having huge problems again launching
16:28 nasa nearly goes completely green
16:33 meaning all of their stuff works the
16:36 second that thing gets out there
16:38 boom first lander
16:42 1975 baby
16:45 it's the viking one thus starts the
16:48 picture game
16:50 now why would there be such a big
16:53 difference between
16:55 russia and the united states with this
16:57 kind of thing
16:58 does russia have to sort of lobby their
17:01 people to pay for a space program and a
17:04 mars program in general no they were the
17:07 communistic block
17:09 they were the ussr so they do whatever
17:13 they want
17:14 so they don't have any problem with
17:15 reporting true failures
17:18 now why they had so many problems
17:20 putting a rocket into space when they
17:22 didn't have any problem putting their
17:23 cosmonauts into space
17:24 i mean even the game of just getting the
17:26 rocket out of your sight and then
17:27 turning in
17:28 claymation stuff or stop animation stuff
17:31 it's sort of
17:32 interesting nasa had launching rockets
17:36 down a little bit better
17:37 and so they're able to perpetrate the
17:39 game
17:41 if you look up on wikipedia which is
17:43 what i'm looking at right now which is
17:45 you type in the list the missions to
17:48 mars
17:49 list of missions to mars and just look
17:51 at the straight up level of successes
17:53 from the united states
17:54 and every other country having gigantic
17:56 problems
17:58 and you know you could say oh it's a
17:59 free country so so somehow
18:01 we have better luck god loves us and
18:04 doesn't like the other guys or some
18:06 malarkey like that well
18:10 i'd probably disagree with you every
18:13 single reason
18:14 that we have heard now of why
18:18 spacex is having issues
18:21 landing stuff on mars
18:24 if you were to take that all the claims
18:26 from all those interviews and take it
18:28 back to the 70s and try to ask them how
18:30 the viking one
18:31 got landed got or landed properly on the
18:34 surface of mars knowing that the surface
18:37 of mars is
18:38 absolutely the most well put it this way
18:42 sorry i'm getting out of myself here in
18:44 the hoax i almost believe the hoax to
18:46 give you an example
18:48 based on the photographs they synthesize
18:51 together
18:51 to sell to you to confirm billions of
18:55 dollars of your tax
18:56 dollars going away most likely into some
18:59 you know missile program or whatever the
19:02 tiniest
19:03 rock okay is potentially going to
19:06 sabotage this entire thing
19:08 let alone a hill a mountain a crater
19:11 whatever but it has to do with the
19:14 weight
19:14 of viking one the methodology of which
19:17 this thing is supposed to be
19:19 finding mars in the middle of nowhere so
19:23 you know that earth
19:26 and again flat earth people just take a
19:29 chill pill
19:30 we're talking about a hoax we're talking
19:31 about a complete hoax so i'm gonna use
19:33 the
19:33 standard helocentric technology to
19:37 continue to dispel this meaning i'm
19:39 using their own weapons against
19:40 themselves right
19:42 their weapons against us against
19:44 themselves
19:46 so earth's going around the sun and mars
19:49 is going around
19:50 the sun and so any one point in time
19:54 these two planets are extremely far
19:57 apart from each other
19:59 so the closest that we can do this and
20:01 the strategy
20:02 is as mars is coming around to the same
20:06 side of our orbit
20:08 to the to the sun we're 33
20:12 i think 0.9 so let's say 34 million
20:15 miles away from each other at the
20:16 closest point
20:18 so the strategy that nasa tells you
20:22 is that we are going to be launching
20:25 ahead of its arrival such that when it
20:28 swings around
20:29 34 million miles away it probably isn't
20:31 directly out so it's going to be even
20:33 further
20:34 up on the tangent of the curve it's
20:36 going to grab
20:37 probably their theory the gravity of
20:40 mars and then do the slingshot thing
20:43 of which again only in the last couple
20:45 decades if they've been illustrating it
20:47 correctly
20:49 they keep showing you perfectly circular
20:51 slingshots which is not a slingshot okay
20:54 as long as matt damon does it in a movie
20:56 it's real
20:58 but now get this mars is traveling in an
21:03 orbit at its own speed right
21:07 it's traveling 54 000 miles an hour or
21:10 24 kilometers per second
21:13 hopefully that helps the european
21:14 community 54 000 miles
21:18 an hour
21:21 that defeats the maximum velocity
21:24 of the service module lunar module
21:26 coming off the saturn
21:28 5 which was clocked at twenty thousand
21:31 miles an hour
21:32 now somebody said that uh in their
21:35 research for my mar
21:36 or moon mission that supposedly that
21:39 whole payload slowed down to thirty
21:41 six hundred miles an hour here's the
21:44 problem with the idea that the lunar
21:46 module slowed down
21:47 going around a slingshot around the
21:50 earth
21:51 one as we noted there's no extra
21:53 propulsion during the slingshotty phase
21:57 to slow it or just to survive a
21:59 slingshot theory right again
22:01 the ellipsis collapses the radius
22:04 of the center of the circle thus driving
22:07 those two objects into
22:08 earth's crust
22:11 earth is 3.6 billion times bigger than
22:14 those two objects and they're just like
22:16 lickety-split no problem we're out of
22:17 here
22:18 but there was one phase of the saturn v
22:20 when it's supposedly hitting this super
22:22 fast thing
22:25 all by itself without introducing force
22:27 to again
22:28 continually increase the radius of the
22:30 elliptical orbit which would be
22:31 a slingshot theory but there's a
22:34 the final booster from the saturn v shot
22:36 it supposedly towards
22:38 the boom all complete
22:42 categorical bs okay
22:45 that's the saturn v did you see a saturn
22:48 v
22:49 shaped rocket get that thing to mars no
22:52 it was a titan rocket
22:54 now is the viking probe slightly smaller
22:57 than the payload
22:58 of the service module lunar module with
23:01 11 through
23:02 14 which didn't have the 700 pound car
23:06 on
23:08 yeah a little bit but now the titan is
23:11 going to have to
23:12 throw this viking one probably more than
23:16 54
23:16 000 miles an hour to just catch up
23:20 with this planet that's going to become
23:22 whizzing by
23:24 the level of utter and complete
23:25 precision
23:27 to get an object to a foreign body in
23:30 space
23:31 is utterly astronomical and cannot be
23:35 done
23:36 i'm going to tell you with some fixed
23:39 navigational systems especially 1975
23:42 people come on
23:44 go look at the biggest super computer in
23:46 the world right just remember the iphone
23:48 4
23:50 was 4500 times faster than the cray
23:53 computer
23:54 in 1979 this was a study done by the
23:58 folks that did the movie tron
23:59 they realized that you could render the
24:01 entire movie tron on an iphone 4
24:04 in 15 minutes but this is 1975
24:08 and this is going to be a computer put
24:10 on board
24:12 a rocket ain't going to be that powerful
24:14 because
24:17 i mean the biggest vax computers the
24:19 biggest mainframes
24:20 or slowest snails compared to today
24:24 and we're talking about a level of
24:25 precision we're going to get into all
24:27 the factors of the launch here in just a
24:28 second
24:30 but it would have to somehow get in a
24:32 very uh
24:34 complex configuration of trying to grab
24:36 this planet
24:38 you're gonna have to overshoot the
24:39 planet while it's going 54 000 miles an
24:42 hour
24:43 you're gonna have to engage its
24:44 gravitational force so specific
24:47 related to the weight of your object
24:50 that you're going to be able to then
24:52 gain acceleration
24:54 to go around it to start collapsing into
24:57 a slingshot orbit to then eventually
25:01 at the right moment in time based on the
25:03 surface
25:04 of mars start dropping out of orbit
25:08 you have to engage some sort of landing
25:10 mechanism
25:12 and then plop down on the surface of
25:14 this absolute
25:15 chaotic world as they portrayed it in
25:17 their photos
25:21 starting to sink in a little bit here
25:24 now let's think about this
25:26 you've got what how did we get to mars
25:28 we build a bunch of
25:30 payload stuff we put it on this rocket
25:32 now the rocket technology is
25:33 pretty ice down it's just amount of
25:36 propulsion
25:38 whatever rocketdyne or other engines are
25:40 put in the titan
25:42 this thing takes off and this goes for
25:45 all the missions ahead of you know this
25:47 whole 1964 thing of
25:49 doing a flyby a flyby was probably what
25:52 we're capable of doing
25:54 potentially today although how close we
25:57 get to it would be an absolute
25:59 luck fest okay um maybe today
26:03 we could potentially pull something off
26:06 except
26:06 rockets engines don't work in space the
26:09 way that
26:10 so many science fiction movies have
26:12 reinforced in your brain
26:13 it doesn't work you're pushing off
26:15 nothing man there's no atmosphere
26:17 there's no nothing
26:19 as spacex is confirmed in recent
26:21 perseverance interviews
26:24 now let's say you had some toys when you
26:27 were a little kid
26:29 and they were toys in which you put an
26:31 object on the other side of the room
26:33 well i put it to you this way i'll make
26:35 it real easy for you
26:36 have you ever putted a golf ball into a
26:38 hole
26:40 and there's terrain issues and all this
26:42 others but even if the
26:43 green is completely flat you're at the
26:45 practice
26:46 putting area at the beginning of a
26:49 golf course just to kind of warm up you
26:51 know
26:53 and you putt and you realize the tiniest
26:56 degree off
26:58 from your putt to that hole ends up
27:01 pretty much blowing the putt now we
27:04 don't have any problems with
27:05 not getting to the hole in a putt right
27:08 you put you can put two
27:10 too lightly and then it stops before it
27:12 gets to hold because this is space
27:13 whatever you tap this ball at it's gonna
27:15 continue going at that velocity
27:17 until it hits something or it's yanked
27:20 by some
27:21 deprivation ether winds
27:25 you know from golf that
27:28 the most minute degree off during the
27:31 putt impact
27:33 is going to either throw off your putt
27:35 or make you
27:37 score that eagle putt you know
27:40 let's increase that difficulty by moving
27:42 your whole 34 million miles away
27:46 and what i'm going to force you to do
27:49 is put through some water first
27:53 so you're going to have and the water
27:55 dissolve it's moving it's it's got
27:56 variable density to it
27:59 a rocket blasting off from the surface
28:01 of the earth
28:02 and heading 34 million miles away
28:06 it might seem pretty uh
28:09 butter through a knife to get out of the
28:10 earth's atmosphere when it comes to this
28:12 kind of calculation
28:14 you might believe the aerospace
28:16 scientists
28:18 i know they believe their own crop but
28:20 we all know that the
28:22 air that we fly in on a commercial jet
28:24 isn't the same density which is why we
28:26 have air pockets
28:28 when the plane seems to be falling in
28:29 the middle of your flight and
28:32 you pee a little right i've been in air
28:35 pockets where stuff you know literally
28:37 levitated in front of my face on a
28:38 commercial flight and
28:40 everybody screamed at the same time
28:42 several times going into vegas man
28:44 that is one of the most tumultuous
28:46 summertime flights ever
28:47 because the thermals are crazy
28:50 most all the rockets that launch are out
28:52 of cape canaveral which is a tropical
28:54 area
28:54 many of the thermals are thick the atmos
28:57 atmosphere
28:58 is humid it's thick now the farther you
29:01 go up there's less
29:02 oxygen less interference less to worry
29:04 about
29:06 the things that one would have to take
29:07 into account when trying to put a ball
29:09 34 million miles away it is going to
29:13 come down to
29:14 how fast did the fuel fall into the
29:18 chamber
29:18 of the rocket and how fast was the
29:20 rocket able
29:22 to ignite that fuel and then how
29:25 synchronized are
29:25 all these engines before liftoff which
29:29 you know that's why they hold it down
29:30 they put these clamps on it and then it
29:31 lets go and it goes right
29:33 try to get everything stationary but we
29:36 know that the fabric of a rocket is
29:37 flexible
29:38 micro fractures happen almost
29:40 instantaneously which is why
29:42 spacex trying to recover these rockets
29:44 is just a flawed theory to begin with
29:46 let alone the cg
29:47 and the lack of pedestrians that ever
29:48 get to see such a thing in life
29:51 but now you've got a rocket gaining
29:53 altitude and speed
29:56 going through this according to a
29:59 rocket's
30:00 speed and tor according to a rocket's
30:03 design
30:04 shape payload
30:08 it is bumping into oxygen it's going to
30:10 either have a pocket or not a pocket
30:11 pocket not a pocket
30:12 it's thick here it's moving there the
30:14 wind's hitting it and shearing it
30:18 there's no way on planet earth without a
30:20 advanced propulsion system
30:23 and a super advanced computer to control
30:24 that propulsion system
30:26 of which none existed at the time we're
30:28 talking about here which should be 64-75
30:32 for us to accurately exit the earth's
30:35 atmosphere
30:36 with any trajectory you could rely on
30:37 when traveling 34 million miles away
30:41 once it's in space then you have the
30:44 fake
30:47 slingshot it's not occurring because the
30:49 rockets aren't designed to actually
30:50 accomplish the slingshot
30:53 if they could just take off straight
30:55 tangent to the curve of taking off
30:56 just immediately leave the atmosphere
30:58 and never do the slingshot crap
31:00 then you got at least a chance but
31:03 that's not the way it works is it
31:05 when you get into the i guess potential
31:09 vacuum of space which is full of ether
31:11 particles and solar radiation
31:14 after the unmanned vehicle goes to the
31:16 van allen belts which would have to
31:18 demand that the emp
31:21 shielding for all relative
31:24 pieces of electronics would be would
31:26 have to be utterly
31:29 conclusively protective otherwise
31:32 all the electronics on this vehicle is
31:33 just going to blow up
31:35 but then again if it's landing in the
31:37 atlantic ocean or the indian ocean or
31:39 wherever
31:39 who cares whatever but what do you think
31:42 the degrees
31:44 would be the accuracy of of perfectness
31:48 required to get to mars based on some
31:50 trajectory that's on a piece of paper
31:52 somewhere
31:54 after you factor in all these
31:55 atmospheric conditions
31:57 and anomalies i'm going to tell you that
32:00 even
32:00 to 1 millionth of a degree off
32:04 after this thing supposedly pops out of
32:07 all the atmospheric layers that we can
32:09 register
32:10 it's passed through the van allen belts
32:12 and now it's sort of in just solar
32:13 radiation space
32:15 minus a coronal mass ejection that would
32:18 just eat this thing's lunch
32:20 it's 34 million miles away
32:23 so isn't it pretty probable
32:28 then even a millionth of a degree off is
32:30 going to make a huge difference
32:32 34 million miles away let alone 10
32:35 millionths of a degree 100 millionths of
32:37 a degree
32:38 i didn't have the time to completely
32:39 figure out what would be the math but if
32:41 i figure it out i'll put it up there
32:43 part of me doesn't care enough to go for
32:45 it when the basics are good enough to
32:47 just roll your eyes and say
32:49 oh yeah i guess this is all bs isn't it
32:52 you're like yeah
32:54 don't feel bad we all fell for it for a
32:56 long time
32:58 but let's say it's off a little bit
33:01 and nasa tries to tell you that a 1964
33:05 success which is a flyby
33:08 a later success to do an orbit and then
33:10 a later success which i think is 71 and
33:12 in 75
33:13 we put an actual lander on the thing
33:18 let's say it's off a little bit this is
33:21 1975
33:22 man 1975 the invention of a pixel
33:26 on a screen is about
33:29 seven years old was ivan sutherland 68
33:32 i think it was so okay this thing's out
33:36 in space by itself
33:38 and it's made out of like you know
33:41 i don't know simon says technology
33:44 it's it's essentially a pong game
33:48 and it's off a little bit how does it
33:49 know it's off and how does it correct
33:51 how would earth know it's off how would
33:54 it know it's off
33:55 how do you calculate 1975
33:59 its position in space related to all the
34:02 stars
34:03 what kind of sensors do you think would
34:05 have to be on the system to be
34:07 taking pictures of constellations that
34:09 way this way
34:10 maybe a super telescope to go straight
34:12 ahead to see if you can see the red
34:13 giant but the thing is coming from
34:14 behind you
34:15 because that's how you're rendezvousing
34:16 with the thing
34:18 how would a correction even happen and
34:20 then what are you gonna do on the
34:22 vehicle
34:24 what extra propulsion system do you
34:26 think exists on this vehicle
34:28 to correct something that can't be off
34:31 even a millionth of a degree
34:32 otherwise you're going someplace else
34:34 for the summer
34:35 i'll tell you what nothing
34:38 only today would we be able to even in
34:42 my opinion
34:43 since being in the wrong place in space
34:45 and i still think that would push the
34:47 very
34:48 boundaries of the fastest systems they
34:50 could put on these things
34:52 but what would you do you'd probably
34:54 have to put a camera somewhere
34:56 some sort of optic i mean what are you
34:59 going to do bounce a radar off the thing
35:01 from earth and try to triangulate it
35:02 with the moon or something
35:05 you'd have to have been on the moon to
35:07 put something on the moon to help you
35:08 triangulate the thing
35:11 get a big space sexton or something
35:12 right and then what are you going to do
35:14 fire retro rockets that don't work in
35:16 space what are those retro rockets
35:17 pushing off of
35:19 nothing you're just making sound you're
35:21 just making noise to yourself
35:24 now i know a lot of you will have seen
35:26 the
35:28 the orbital photographs the early
35:31 orbital photographs of mars
35:33 that they pitch to you which has the
35:36 four-sided pyramids these uh five-sided
35:40 pyramids
35:42 it has supposed to leave the face on
35:44 mars
35:46 and you might say to yourself well
35:49 why would they put such a thing
35:52 in one of the photographs if they were
35:54 going to be faking something
35:56 i think those are little homages to
35:58 themselves
36:00 but now let's let's make an association
36:03 that probably hasn't happened
36:04 in any other videos that you've seen
36:07 what did
36:08 supposedly werner von braun say to his
36:10 secretary
36:12 one that's for the flat earthers will
36:13 will acknowledge the fact that he put
36:15 the passage about the firmament
36:17 on his gravestone seems odd that a guy
36:20 who's into space travel goes back to an
36:23 ancient biblical
36:24 model of the earth which has been
36:26 completely deprecated and you're
36:27 supposed to laugh at people who believe
36:28 it
36:29 he put that on his tombstone but he said
36:33 that they are preparing for
36:34 already a fake invasion from aliens
36:40 but in 75 they show you pyramids and
36:42 they show you this face on mars
36:45 almost as if the plan was like all right
36:48 let's prep this baby
36:49 with some evidence we can lean on when
36:51 that kind of martians man
36:54 we're already going to tell all the
36:55 astronauts including buddha buzz aldrin
36:57 now is running around
36:58 talking about aliens on the moon and oh
37:01 my god these people
37:03 here maybe there's a prize in heaven for
37:05 entertaining the people on earth
37:08 buzzing god just high five each other
37:10 man that was good poof oh my god and you
37:12 said the alien thing and then you
37:13 screwed up a couple times on tv and said
37:16 once we figure out how to go to the moon
37:17 it'll be a lot a lot easier to get to
37:19 mars
37:21 aldrin said that on live television
37:24 uh but youtube has so utterly scraped
37:26 that video off
37:28 you can't find it supposedly it's in a
37:30 journalism video but i
37:32 can't go through his 2000 videos to find
37:34 it and he doesn't have a method to be
37:35 communicated with
37:36 so if any of you know jaren from
37:38 journalism or you want to
37:40 tumultuously hit him to figure out which
37:42 video he has that in
37:45 i would mouth-kiss you for that video
37:48 but let's just go back you got an optic
37:51 you have some camera
37:55 supposedly in 1975 you got all this
37:57 artificial intelligence
37:58 with tons of memory and tons of
38:00 processor power to make it
38:02 a last-minute adjustment to your
38:04 trajectory
38:06 which if you screw that up uh you know
38:08 you're going to be just
38:09 either cratering directly into mars or
38:11 flying away off in the middle of nowhere
38:14 and we're going to get moving up here
38:17 soon
38:18 but you'd have to know what you're
38:20 looking at you have to look out at the
38:22 stars and this artificial intelligence
38:24 is
38:24 going to have to say well that's where
38:26 we're supposed to find mars with this
38:28 camera at this moment in time based on
38:30 the
38:30 trajectory we were given from earth and
38:33 supposedly we must be going 75 000 miles
38:36 an hour or something
38:36 it's way higher than any object i've
38:38 ever heard traveling in space but you
38:40 know
38:41 maybe right i didn't look up how fast
38:44 the titan was supposed to be going i'll
38:45 try to put that up there for you
38:47 but it's looking backwards and it's
38:48 going oh crap we're off and somehow it's
38:51 going to fight figure this out
38:53 it's going to somehow have
38:54 three-dimensional space knowledge of
38:56 itself
38:58 it's going to have transformational
38:59 algorithms which are some of the most
39:01 tumultuous algorithms for computers
39:03 today you know with gigaflops and
39:06 teraflops and these
39:07 5 000 video cards this thing's going to
39:10 figure out where it is in space
39:13 this the earth would be a little dot now
39:15 by the time he could see
39:17 mars in an optic earth is going to be
39:20 teeny tiny so there's no like looking
39:21 back to go where jerk you know
39:23 based on that and this and that it's
39:25 going to have to
39:26 derive it from constellations or
39:28 something
39:29 this doesn't work people we're good at
39:32 math
39:34 but what's the contingency with math
39:36 planning
39:38 it doesn't work beyond the first shot in
39:40 war
39:42 so this thing was ever off it's not it's
39:44 never going to do anything
39:45 it's going to just go off in the middle
39:46 of nowhere so what's the game
39:49 let's just reestablish the platform so
39:50 we can go on to the 90s
39:53 the game is launch a rocket out of sight
39:55 out of mine
39:57 then they must have the photographs
39:59 ready and if they're smart they have all
40:00 these photographs ready before they ever
40:02 launch the rocket
40:03 and they're vetted by geologists
40:06 who are going to say oh yeah that you
40:08 know this this could happen this could
40:09 work right
40:10 how do they do it you just build a big
40:13 studio underground
40:15 they got plenty of time and the when you
40:18 talk to people who are in serious
40:19 military
40:20 operations you will hear about
40:24 jaw-dropping experiences where people go
40:28 underground and there's entire cities
40:30 down there with
40:31 giant ceilings that are so high you
40:32 don't even know how tall they are
40:34 the denver airport i believe has 27
40:38 floors underneath it or something
40:40 someone i know very very well for more
40:43 than three decades
40:45 went there to teach and they got in the
40:47 elevator to go down to the third floor
40:49 and said that there were 27 other floors
40:51 or something to that level
40:52 is really really deep underneath there
40:55 there's a military base under the
40:57 colorado airport
40:59 so you build a warehouse it doesn't have
41:00 to be underground but you know it's
41:02 easier if it is that way there's no
41:04 wow what's this huge building doing here
41:07 and then you just work on it you work on
41:09 it forever long you need take five years
41:11 if you need to go get a bunch of lava
41:13 rocks and
41:14 other things and push it all over the
41:16 place
41:19 if you need iron dust believe me there's
41:20 tons of that in the world
41:22 out of manufacturing alone they could
41:25 tent photographs in computers
41:29 roughly in that time frame and they can
41:31 use gels and all kinds of stuff to
41:33 accomplish it in
41:34 camera without special effects or
41:35 digital processing
41:38 i think the brilliant thing that they've
41:39 done is they created a hoax in the 70s
41:41 that
41:42 they were able to recreate in the 90s
41:45 and present time now every time i watch
41:48 a video
41:49 about controlling these rovers on mars
41:53 it's always a jpl i've watched
41:57 exhaustive specials where they're
42:00 talking to the
42:01 the wide-eyed virgin technicians who are
42:04 controlling the rovers with a remote
42:06 control joystick
42:08 it looks like zaxon's control stick
42:11 right
42:12 and then of course it takes a long time
42:14 for the signal to get to
42:15 mars and then it's got to do the
42:16 maneuver and then it sends back
42:19 the information maybe a video maybe a
42:21 picture of the fact that it succeeded
42:24 and there's apollo 13 stuff you know
42:27 where
42:27 oh a tire got stuck in the sand
42:30 maybe we won't be able to get this out
42:32 of the sand
42:33 drama drama drama well with today's
42:36 computers
42:38 and a project a product that you can
42:41 download on your computer called
42:42 terrigen
42:45 they could easily wire this whole thing
42:47 in to keep the
42:48 the the geek thinking that they're
42:50 actually doing this for real
42:52 but they hit the joystick and then the
42:53 time it takes to go there and back
42:55 theoretically in their brain the
42:56 supercomputer and their sides run a
42:58 terrigen or their own
42:59 proprietary software but i will remind
43:01 you guys
43:02 that i discovered i've met two of the
43:05 programmers that wrote the proprietary
43:07 software for
43:08 jpl to do this but they just simply
43:12 adjust the 3d model
43:13 and render it with gobs of memory
43:16 terabytes of memory man
43:17 and send back every grain of sand it is
43:20 my personal belief that all of the
43:22 physical experiments where they're
43:23 cutting rocks in half and all that stuff
43:25 is actually done
43:26 on a sound stage done way before this
43:29 thing gets there
43:31 so some of you heard this story before
43:32 i'm going to tell it again i was at a
43:34 party in san diego
43:36 which was a an amazing party it was on
43:39 top of a restaurant
43:41 it was a two-story it was actually a
43:42 one-story restaurant but you get on the
43:44 on the roof it was all open and
43:45 beautiful it was a great summer day
43:47 and i am with a special effects outfit
43:51 and everyone that worked on tron
43:53 basically
43:54 but they'd worked on a million things i
43:56 found guys friends of mine from the
43:58 video game industry that i hadn't seen
44:00 in a few years there and i was like dude
44:04 what are you doing here
44:06 and they were like you know i worked in
44:07 this project that project i was like wow
44:09 so anyway that party concludes and we go
44:12 off to
44:13 a buddy who worked on tron who had a
44:15 suite down the street
44:17 but they screwed up his suite and they
44:19 upgraded him to like the
44:21 the pimp daddy suite on the very top two
44:23 stories it was the top of the motel man
44:25 so we're out on the balcony and i find
44:28 myself standing next to these two guys
44:29 and
44:30 i just started below conversation
44:32 meanwhile there's a dude pacing behind
44:34 us which i'll get to in a second
44:36 i had a question for them that they
44:37 didn't know how to answer and my buddy
44:38 richard taylor finally answered it for
44:40 me
44:40 who took me there i said how did you get
44:44 the computer images that you created
44:47 into
44:48 film because you know there wasn't any
44:51 real digitization process there
44:53 back in 80 to 82. and they didn't know
44:57 and the because they were way off on
45:00 another part of the country
45:01 doing their 3d and sending it to the
45:03 group of disney who then was hooding
45:05 a real high resolution monitor and had a
45:08 movie camera in there and they were
45:09 advancing every frame and taking a
45:11 photograph advancing every frame taking
45:12 a photograph
45:14 that's how they got it into the film on
45:16 tron
45:17 i'm just going to say it again tron was
45:20 the most amazing
45:22 technical achievement incorporating live
45:26 action and cg in the very first movie
45:28 ever that have cg
45:29 and that wasn't done again until at
45:31 least t2
45:33 you might like last starfighter you
45:34 either had cg scenes or you had live
45:37 action scenes you didn't have people
45:38 walking around
45:39 tracking inside cg so i had last
45:42 starfighter in my brain when i asked the
45:44 next question to these two gentlemen
45:47 and they were the nicest freaking guys
45:49 just dressed in normal clothes
45:53 i said what movie did you work on after
45:54 tron surely these guys
45:57 pioneered the technology
46:00 it would have been last starfighter
46:01 would have been something else right
46:03 commercials or something like that
46:04 nope they said oh we went to work for
46:07 jpl
46:08 for 13 years i said oh really i said
46:11 well that's cool what'd you do
46:13 they said we created 3d terrain software
46:17 just like terrigen now terragen is a
46:19 separate guy separate project most
46:21 likely not related
46:22 but definitely well i should say related
46:24 but not related necessarily development
46:26 team so i'm looking at these guys you
46:29 know and i
46:29 i know 3d terrain software dealt with it
46:32 on many different situations both
46:34 consumer products
46:35 professional products and so i said you
46:37 know
46:38 i said well why were you doing that
46:39 because um
46:41 you know what is it to like simulate
46:43 worlds so that we can
46:46 take in telemetry data from satellites
46:48 landing on other planets and render it
46:50 and everything
46:51 and they were like well not really it
46:52 was just like terrain software and i
46:54 said well how good was it
46:56 and i said well really it's as good as
46:59 the computer can hold
47:00 objects and memory the 3d meshes and the
47:02 textures
47:04 the materials and all that stuff
47:07 i said well how good is it and they said
47:09 well every grain of sand if you want it
47:12 now i didn't talk to them about water
47:14 but then water's not on mars right
47:16 problem solved man today it's no big
47:19 deal you could download blender 3d and
47:20 get water
47:21 to look damn real man the layman can't
47:24 figure it out
47:26 so that would be let's say they got the
47:28 job in 1983 and you fast forward
47:31 13 years you're in 1996 aren't you
47:36 what happened to 96 oh we put our first
47:40 rover on mars in fact we
47:44 crossed a milestone for mankind
47:48 first rover on a foreign planet
47:52 unmanned right okay
47:55 and then they brought back a bunch of
47:56 pictures it only ran for a little while
47:59 and then it expired liability
48:02 tempered and once it succeeded
48:06 they stopped working for
48:09 jpl but let's rewind
48:13 to 1984. after the
48:16 peter heims movie 2010 a space odyssey
48:21 which some people utterly hate uh in the
48:24 hollywood
48:24 region and some people love it i think
48:27 it was just fine
48:29 a lot of amazing things in it my buddy
48:32 richard taylor who
48:34 did all the special effects for tron
48:37 technically he wasn't the special
48:38 effects supervisor but might as well
48:40 have been
48:42 no disrespect to alan shaw who's an
48:43 amazing man
48:45 but he hired me uh after i met him at a
48:48 syd me
48:49 documentary airing in santa monica the
48:51 premiere
48:53 he goes look man i got all these old
48:55 reels of my
48:57 work over the years and richard did the
48:59 opening credits and closing credits for
49:01 2010 he says um you know i got all this
49:04 stuff i needed i'll be all digitized we
49:06 took it down to a place in la got it all
49:07 digitized but there was a laser disk
49:09 of the 2010 making of so i sent it to my
49:13 dad in texas he's got laserdisc
49:15 machines he rasterizes it for me sends
49:18 it back
49:19 and on that back of that cd or laserdisc
49:23 there was an interview with two guys
49:25 from gpl they're sitting in jpl
49:28 behind there's one guy on the uh i guess
49:31 your left
49:32 the dude on the right the guy on the
49:34 left had a big 36-inch
49:36 tube television behind him running the
49:37 sequence of simulating
49:40 jupiter which i don't know if you've
49:42 seen the movie but
49:43 jupiter gets swallowed up and turned
49:45 into a star but they had mastered
49:47 spherical fluid dynamics at jpl
49:52 what does that do well it's all under
49:53 the guise of creating 2010 space odyssey
49:56 but what does it really do
49:58 well it's right in time for the voyager
50:00 to start sending photographs back
50:03 that a telescope can't simulate i
50:05 remember sitting in the break room at
50:06 walmart probably 1985
50:08 looking at some national geographic or
50:10 something and there was the first
50:12 pictures of i believe neptune
50:15 and you look at what they were able to
50:17 do for this movie and you look at the
50:18 requirements to simulate a gas giant and
50:21 it is just
50:22 a piece of cake man no problem
50:25 i mean we know that matte painters in
50:29 hollywood could paint any planet that
50:32 you want and you wouldn't know the
50:33 difference
50:33 trust me trust me they're so good
50:37 especially today with digital stuff you
50:38 just do it in 3d no big deal but even
50:40 back in the 80s they were amazing
50:42 so hollywood is used as a staging
50:46 excuse to build all the technology to
50:49 make you see the stuff that you want to
50:51 see you're buying pictures that's all
50:52 you're buying rock it outside out of
50:54 mine
50:54 send the pictures to the public wipe
50:56 your hands get ready for the next big
50:58 grab of money
51:00 because some of you might be like
51:01 accountants and you're like hey mister
51:03 you're wrong
51:04 every dime that's spent on those rockets
51:06 are spin on those rockets
51:09 okay you know the budget that you don't
51:11 hear about
51:13 is the staff that constantly gets
51:15 employed
51:16 and potentially there's a column in
51:18 their ledger which says
51:20 shh don't say anything about this money
51:22 being spent
51:23 it's going someplace else plus you know
51:27 about the 500
51:28 toilet seats and you know 300
51:30 screwdrivers
51:32 a lot of that's how that those budgets
51:33 get put together back in the day
51:37 but then you might be saying hey man
51:38 you're really painting this two die
51:40 dialistic man
51:41 nasa made a huge mistake in the late 90s
51:45 it's the famous 1998 problem they built
51:48 a slightly bigger rover
51:51 this was supposed to last a lot longer
51:52 like the one that landed in 2001
51:56 and its cousin in the land of 2003.
51:59 so they had two in a row you know 1998
52:00 99 1999 one's an orbiter that crashes in
52:03 98 and one's a lander that
52:06 fails to land but the 98 one
52:11 is supposed to be an orbiter so it's
52:13 supposed to have some pretty high
52:14 altitude stuff
52:15 a lot more complex doing high altitude
52:18 reconnaissance photographs of a planet
52:20 because it's going to show a lot more of
52:21 the surface isn't it
52:23 it burdens you more what would be harder
52:26 to simulate in 3d
52:28 you download your favorite 3d package
52:30 and you crack your knuckles and you're
52:31 going to
52:32 study up on how to use it is it harder
52:34 to do this backyard right here with some
52:36 grass on it
52:37 or is it harder to shoot earth from say
52:41 i don't know 100 miles up and account
52:44 for all of
52:44 southern california all of its mountains
52:47 and rivers
52:47 and all that stuff a lot more geology in
52:50 those high altitude shots
52:52 well the dudes that handled the 96
52:54 landing just had you know some
52:56 vistas that had to look like the viking
52:58 one stuff pretty simple
53:00 a bunch of rocks that are kind of
53:01 underground a little bit
53:03 it's all iron dust iron rocks iron iron
53:06 iron
53:07 they gave you the excuse that they had
53:09 cut the budget
53:10 during clinton's administration and nasa
53:13 just didn't have enough money to get the
53:14 job done right
53:17 considering they never make any mistakes
53:19 on average this was a surprise
53:21 but their excuse for the 98 orbiter
53:24 crashing into the surface of mars was
53:26 that their
53:27 appeared to be no iso 9000
53:30 testing now one of my girlfriends from
53:34 the late 80s
53:36 was a qa person on the tomahawk missile
53:39 for eight solid years and so i would
53:42 hear all kinds of stories nothing
53:43 nothing covert or anything but just all
53:46 the processes that it was
53:48 it was under scrutiny to test all these
53:51 modules
53:52 different companies in the united states
53:53 building one piece another piece they
53:55 all have to communicate with each other
53:58 at no point is anything that's launched
54:00 by nasa not completely and utterly
54:02 tested
54:03 within these formats and these formats
54:05 of ice 9000 stuff and
54:07 probably some sigma 6 testing
54:10 styles which is your agile stuff on
54:13 crack
54:14 they completely and utterly simulate
54:17 these launches
54:18 on the ground just having the units talk
54:21 to each other and spitting out stuff out
54:23 of apis and saying this is what i think
54:25 is happening that's what i think is
54:26 happening
54:27 but they told you that there was a
54:30 a failure to account for
54:34 metric to standard conversions and so
54:37 the propulsion
54:38 system overcompensated or under
54:40 compensated whatever the case might be
54:42 and it resulted in the crash in the
54:43 surface of mars
54:44 hell crashing something into the surface
54:46 of mars at this stage in 2020
54:49 should be considered a major major
54:51 accomplishment
54:52 let alone all the spacex stuff they're
54:54 claiming given all the evidence i've
54:56 already
54:57 mentioned to you about the people i've
54:59 met
55:01 about what we can assert from 2010
55:05 i'm gonna tell you what happened this is
55:07 my hunch
55:10 the pictures weren't ready now this
55:13 thing takes some months to get there
55:15 so imagine you're you're at the round
55:17 table of
55:19 this deep state sort of thing or
55:21 whatever you want to call it probably
55:22 not deep state but whatever it is
55:25 this money laundering apparatus they've
55:27 created
55:28 and you're like okay what do we
55:32 what are we getting from photos right
55:33 the department that covers photos
55:35 and the guy's like well we're pretty
55:37 close but
55:39 the geologists are still arguing about a
55:40 few things and
55:42 and the software's you know run into
55:44 some glitches
55:46 but don't worry go ahead and launch and
55:49 with the time that we have left we're
55:51 going to work overtime on this stuff
55:54 which must be a seriously small team of
55:56 programmers men
55:58 i know that the star wars satellites are
56:00 programmed with a very small staff of ai
56:02 coders and lisp
56:04 and so you can't work these guys to
56:06 death they got to sleep right
56:08 so however many months later they're not
56:11 ready
56:12 i'm sure some heads rolled and the
56:16 management layers not the coders levels
56:17 probably because you can't mess with the
56:19 coders they're invaluable
56:22 and they said okay plan b crash it we'll
56:24 blame the budgets
56:27 and this problem persisted across the
56:29 next year 99 when the lander was
56:31 supposed to get there and
56:32 so it had a landing problem failed to
56:34 land
56:36 something happened something doubled
56:37 down between 1999 and 2001
56:41 and this is where we get the odyssey in
56:42 2001 and the express
56:45 in 2003
56:48 only supposed to be operational for 11
56:51 months
56:52 and the way that they talk about this is
56:54 that it has fuel on board
56:56 which would be power but they sent solar
56:59 panels up there
57:01 place has an atmosphere we know now that
57:04 it has
57:04 uh i mean we're just gonna use their
57:06 evidence against them right
57:08 supposedly it has sandstorms that make
57:10 saudi arabia sandstorms
57:12 you know look like little breezes in the
57:14 wind
57:15 the matt damon movie you know dramatized
57:18 this
57:19 heavily so you have solar panels
57:22 where they have to be exposed to the sun
57:24 in order to
57:26 generate any power now i've heard two
57:29 separate conflicting excuses or
57:31 methodologies by which these solar
57:33 panels self-clean themselves
57:36 both of them make no sense whatsoever
57:38 because we now have what
57:40 since 2001 we've got massive solar panel
57:42 farms
57:43 here in the united states and around the
57:45 world
57:46 there are videos on youtube of them
57:48 cleaning these things and it's a very
57:50 laborious process
57:52 big scrubbers that have to scrub these
57:54 things and they're in the desert
57:56 is that interesting this is the most
57:57 likely thing we have that
57:59 matches mars atmospheres except
58:02 our little dusty dirt is made of a
58:04 conductive
58:05 metal called iron i suggest you watch
58:08 one of the cleaning videos it's very
58:09 therapeutic it's like people cutting
58:10 things with knives you know those videos
58:14 so you have a conductive dust flying
58:15 everywhere
58:17 uh the one i've heard the most is that
58:19 these little butterfly
58:22 panels shake they save up they go down
58:25 to a minimum amount where the shaking is
58:27 actually
58:28 still capable of operating and then it
58:29 shakes shake shake shake shakes
58:31 and it shakes all the dust off the
58:32 panels then it's fine
58:35 if it rolls underneath the minimum
58:37 amount of power
58:38 it's done and in all the years it's been
58:40 there which is 19 years for the
58:43 odyssey there's never been a problem
58:45 with this
58:46 methodology now the second method
58:48 someone recently said in a comment
58:50 was that it uses uh some sort of
58:52 electromagnetic
58:54 repulsion technique sounds like it that
58:58 would even take more power
59:00 but now what did i just say about storms
59:04 happen all right
59:07 it's just really sand storms more than
59:09 anything because there's no
59:10 water on mars at least in their
59:12 simulation so there shouldn't be any
59:14 rain
59:16 but now uh let's just say
59:19 you need to do this little renew the
59:21 panel thing
59:23 and five minutes later you've blown all
59:25 your wad man you got all the electricity
59:27 completely depleted in this thing
59:29 now you're just gonna sit there and
59:31 charge back up from the sun
59:33 but a sandstorm comes five minutes later
59:36 and utterly
59:37 craters your rover now we need to make
59:40 sure that we understand
59:42 has anyone ever seen a hurricane
59:45 weather report where i don't know like
59:48 uh
59:48 cars flying down the street because it's
59:50 so intense have you ever seen a semi
59:52 drive down the highway and get blown
59:54 over
59:54 just with afternoon winds
59:58 now we might be able to say this rover
59:59 has a low center center of gravity
60:02 but i don't know how this thing would
60:04 perform even in the middle east with
60:06 those crazy stand sandstorms
60:08 at some point the wind is going to
60:10 exceed the capability of this rover to
60:12 stay upright
60:13 it is going to get hurled across the
60:15 desert
60:17 of mars it will but that apparently just
60:19 doesn't happen
60:21 but now you cake this thing with tons of
60:23 iron ash
60:25 why do you think all the rocks are half
60:26 buried in their simulation
60:28 because they've told you the you know
60:30 the sand flows around
60:32 so the wheels are buried the chassis is
60:35 buried
60:36 the solar panels are covered up and you
60:38 don't have enough power to do
60:39 jack i don't care what you do
60:43 you could be there in a spacesuit with
60:45 one of those little sweeper things your
60:47 grandma used to keep in the kitchen
60:48 right
60:49 a little tiny broom handle thing and
60:51 then you just you're trying to get
60:53 you know wow it's got power but great it
60:55 can't move anywhere
60:56 because it's caked it's sunk it's like
60:59 every single
61:01 atv that gets stuck on a beach in modern
61:04 day times
61:05 we swallow this stuff just like mr james
61:09 randy said you make assumptions
61:11 for those of you missed the episode i'll
61:14 just tell you one thing he's eddie
61:15 walked on stage james randy is the guy
61:17 who ran the skeptic society forever
61:19 he worse he wears glasses everybody
61:21 knows he wears glasses and he walked on
61:22 stage
61:24 wearing glasses and eventually he starts
61:25 trying to tell people that they make
61:26 assumptions
61:27 and this is how magicians work he takes
61:30 his glasses off and because he says i
61:31 can't see any of you but you guys think
61:33 i'm seeing you and they tell me you're
61:34 there and i can hear you kind of making
61:35 noises so i think you're there
61:37 because i need glasses or i can't see
61:38 you so he takes his glasses off and he
61:40 says you might think i can see you
61:41 because i have glasses on he puts his
61:42 two fingers through where the lenses are
61:44 and there are no lenses
61:45 he says you assumed these are real
61:47 glasses and so you bought the hoax
61:50 and then he takes his real glasses out
61:51 of his pocket puts him on
61:53 and completes his presentation space
61:56 shows on tv
61:57 and space movies that we love like star
62:00 wars
62:01 star trek space 1999 every single thing
62:05 you've ever loved about space travel
62:07 on fictional constructs on tv
62:11 are educating you incorrectly about how
62:14 space
62:15 works that just a cone and some fire
62:18 create a change in the trajectory of a
62:20 spaceship
62:22 to remind you spacex just took an
62:24 interview about the perseverance
62:26 that's going to land in february next
62:28 year 2021
62:30 and they explicitly said this is the
62:32 heaviest rover we can put on mars and
62:34 the reason why
62:35 is that the atmosphere isn't very dense
62:37 on mars
62:38 and the boosters that we have created to
62:41 slow this thing down before it crushes
62:42 into the surface of mars
62:45 it cannot be any heavier with the
62:48 boosters that they have built
62:49 otherwise it would crater because it
62:51 couldn't slow down because there's not
62:53 enough atmosphere to push off of to slow
62:54 down
62:56 wow awesome
63:00 okay that's good we know this now
63:03 so when you have zero atmosphere what
63:06 are they saying
63:07 they're saying that nothing can slow it
63:08 down therefore retro rockets in space
63:12 that you've seen in tons of fake nasa
63:13 footage and all the sci-fi shows you've
63:16 ever seen
63:17 ever in your life doesn't work
63:21 and i'll give you a little analogy for
63:23 what you're probably going to feel like
63:24 if any of this comes out but you
63:25 probably won't
63:26 but you'll know
63:29 have you ever watched an old buck rogers
63:31 show from like the uh
63:33 1930s
63:36 and you see that when they fly up in the
63:38 sky and what's awesome about his flash
63:40 gordon
63:41 did a beautiful job on this the flash
63:44 gordon's actually another show you could
63:45 watch from the 30s that has the same
63:47 issue
63:47 but when they would fly way up in the
63:49 sky in buck rogers
63:51 there was still like a light and an
63:53 atmosphere you never got into space you
63:55 never got into blackness they never
63:57 portrayed that
63:58 because we simply didn't know what it
64:01 would be like to go
64:02 higher in the atmosphere okay
64:05 well that's the way you're going to feel
64:06 when you look back on all this stuff
64:08 after
64:08 we maybe truly accomplish this stuff
64:12 if we can ever get the world out of the
64:13 hands of all these satan
64:15 satanists you're going to find out
64:18 and you're going to go wow i could
64:20 totally see it now i couldn't see it
64:22 before but now i can see it
64:23 i mean totally see it down to your soul
64:26 so now we have another player which is
64:28 china
64:30 and you have to understand china's in a
64:32 major transition right now
64:35 you know trying to get first world
64:36 status in a really blatant way
64:39 which you know good for them
64:42 unfortunately they have
64:43 100 control through the communist ccp
64:46 you know
64:47 so now they're just knocking it out of
64:49 the park again
64:52 again incapable of making raptor engines
64:54 but can get to mars
64:56 pretty awesome pretty awesome ability
64:58 there so they're playing the same game
65:01 on one level you go why not why not it's
65:03 going to
65:04 put together a lot of patriotic feelings
65:08 within their
65:09 population they're going to hate my
65:12 episodes
65:13 go see my episode called nasa for sale
65:15 to better understand the dynamics of
65:17 that
65:18 but nasa is for sale it's a propaganda
65:22 weapon now to one funnel tons of money
65:25 and two to invigorate your population
65:30 now the positive side effect of all
65:32 space programs that are faked is that
65:34 you do
65:35 get a lot of kids into every aspect of
65:38 science
65:39 from computer science to mechanical
65:41 science to
65:42 aerospace rocketry so
65:46 it's kind of cool but imagine that all
65:49 your elders
65:50 lied about everything and you're truly
65:52 coming up a whiz kid
65:55 and you have better means of doing
65:57 things or real means of doing things but
65:59 they're
66:00 now they can't let you fly because
66:03 meaning like your wings to do what you
66:04 want
66:06 because you're going to start stepping
66:07 on their hoax you're going to start
66:09 revealing their hoax
66:11 imagine you i mean just fictitiously
66:13 think about this you have some kid in
66:15 some los alamos lab or something
66:17 he's got lots of resources for whatever
66:19 reason the kid is so senior
66:21 he or she is able to build things at
66:23 night with things and they're kind of
66:25 keeping it quiet
66:27 they end up building a true spaceship
66:30 through anti-gravity ethereal engines
66:33 it's all set there's no problem with any
66:35 radiation because of the way the ship's
66:37 created it keeps all radiation going to
66:39 the inside of the ship
66:40 they're just about to launch all by
66:42 themselves on a saturday night just like
66:44 the explorers movie
66:46 and either they really do it and go
66:48 there very quickly of course
66:50 and find out oh my god i went to the
66:52 moon there's nothing there
66:54 i suspect there's nothing on mars as
66:56 well
66:57 would that person be celebrated once
66:59 they came home and said oh my god
67:01 they're chinese let's say they're
67:02 chinese and they they come home and
67:03 they're like hey ccp
67:05 i'd prove that america never went to the
67:07 moon
67:09 and then their organs are harvested
67:11 because uh
67:12 they're china is standing on the
67:15 shoulders of america's claims
67:18 it's all a big hush hush wink wink nudge
67:20 nudge thing
67:22 we won't tell on you you don't tell us i
67:24 think russia and america had that
67:25 agreement
67:26 for quite some time it's potential
67:30 you know that uh it is a potential that
67:32 they
67:34 never really communicated that russia
67:36 and america had ever communicated but we
67:37 kind of knew
67:38 through inference these hoaxes were
67:40 going on and we weren't going to
67:41 tattletail on each other for whatever
67:43 reason
67:45 now do i think you need to get all upset
67:46 about this
67:48 nah don't worry about it let them do
67:51 whatever they're going to do
67:52 they're just tying nooses around their
67:54 neck
67:56 now how could they continue doing this
67:57 for a very long time
68:00 put the world in some tyrannical
68:01 lockdown oh
68:03 oh wait that actually has already
68:05 happened
68:06 unbelievable unbelievable
68:09 here we are stuff's happening the
68:12 ignorant or trying to be virtuous
68:14 the ignorant who are good people are
68:16 keeping everyone locked down because
68:17 they believe every single thing they're
68:20 ever told
68:21 so you might be asking okay dude pretty
68:24 good presentation
68:25 maybe maybe you say that and then you're
68:27 like okay what about the spacex thing
68:30 and what about space force how's this
68:31 all come together
68:33 well a month before space force
68:37 was announced by president trump i had
68:39 done an episode
68:40 about 45 days before called replacing
68:43 nasa where i suggested the exact
68:45 same thing the rationale was this
68:51 because our space program has always
68:52 been going through nasa
68:54 they've got private sector sort of
68:56 objectives like rovers on mars and mars
68:59 mars mars it has nothing to do with the
69:00 military industrial complex
69:02 and so we have this black op laundry
69:04 going on
69:06 fund a bunch of stuff over here
69:10 divert a bunch of money over there every
69:12 time the space shuttle went up i mean
69:13 two-thirds of the time it was always a
69:15 military satellite that they couldn't
69:16 tell you what they were doing
69:18 how convenient they didn't have to film
69:20 anything
69:21 so spacex is a beautiful quarantined
69:24 project
69:25 slash division of the military which i
69:27 guess is not called
69:29 i got spacex i mean space force which is
69:31 called something else now
69:32 someone just told me that i completely
69:33 forgot i'm sorry i'll put it on the
69:36 screen
69:38 but what trump did was he got rid of
69:40 part of the corruption to say okay i'm
69:42 gonna move this out
69:43 and now you gotta live on your own you
69:44 got your own unit
69:46 and the accounting sheet your business
69:49 unit you have to make money with what
69:51 you do
69:51 or at least do what you're going to say
69:52 within the budget that you have
69:54 we don't need your money congress is
69:57 going to give it directly to
69:58 the military for space exploration and
70:01 we
70:02 as space force can do anything they want
70:04 they can use nasa to launch something
70:06 the russians to launch something spacex
70:08 the french whatever
70:11 their own division i'm sure they're
70:12 going to get to the point where they're
70:14 doing what apple does make your own
70:15 chips you know
70:17 now the creation of spacex is really
70:19 interesting
70:21 one i think that if you look at all the
70:22 spacex rocketry
70:24 it's just cream of the crop pre-spacex
70:28 designs that have been very very
70:29 reliable
70:30 up until the point spacex was actually
70:31 created so in terms of innovation
70:34 i don't believe for a second these
70:36 booster you know
70:37 tubes are coming back down by themselves
70:39 and landing on a freaking barge in the
70:41 middle of the ocean
70:44 that has been picked apart by special
70:46 effects people in hollywood
70:48 it's it's it's so abysmally inaccurate
70:50 frames are missing
70:52 this just just ask a top gun fighter
70:54 what it's like to land on a aircraft
70:56 carrier in the middle of the night
70:58 and tell me that a computer is going to
70:59 figure it out all the cameras going out
71:01 before the actual landing happens and
71:03 the camera comes back on
71:05 you have there's only been one piece of
71:07 footage i've seen
71:08 supposedly okay and it's so
71:11 ingeniously crafted for the [ __ ] okay
71:15 the two boosters that land in florida
71:19 always land next to a row of trees and
71:22 so the only
71:22 pedestrian looking photograph or video
71:25 from our cell phone
71:26 i believe was shot by a spacex employee
71:29 and those little boosters went behind
71:32 the trees
71:33 ah you don't have to actually simulate
71:35 the whole thing and they're getting
71:36 better with some of their hoaxy footage
71:38 but the first time those things ever
71:40 landed on the two little
71:42 pads which why would you bring them down
71:44 really close to each other
71:46 thus increasing if one goes off the
71:49 other one
71:50 they could bump into the other one and
71:51 knock the other one over when the other
71:52 one would have landed properly
71:54 that risk is unnecessary and ridiculous
71:57 but we know that cranes dropped those
71:59 things down the first time because they
72:01 bounced
72:02 in ridiculous ways that no landing
72:04 mechanism would bounce
72:06 they fixed that problem but they've also
72:08 started cutting the cameras before the
72:09 impact
72:10 to cover the problem you also never saw
72:12 the top
72:13 of that booster because the crane's
72:14 hanging on to it from above
72:17 is there real fire coming up from
72:19 underneath it well sure
72:21 why not now the recent starship thing
72:24 that
72:25 went up and fell down that's pretty well
72:28 videotaped
72:29 it looks like what would actually happen
72:31 a big explosion
72:34 remember nasa was trying for like 45
72:36 years
72:37 to take a little tiny rocket that looked
72:40 like the one that uh was six million
72:42 dollar man
72:43 was supposedly crashed right i forgot
72:44 what the real ship was called but try to
72:46 send it up just a little bit and then
72:48 bring it back down to land it
72:49 every single time even if it landed it
72:52 would fall over
72:53 very difficult spacex man if you thought
72:56 nasa was lucky
72:58 spacex is even more lucky and you know
73:00 they've had their mishaps and explosions
73:02 but then again
73:03 the launch of a rocket is a very real
73:05 thing so all of the factors and
73:08 and anomalies will occur when it's a
73:11 real thing
73:12 once it goes into a computer well then
73:15 it's perfect
73:16 because it's completely simulated i've
73:19 had extensive conversations with people
73:20 about what the strategy with spacex
73:22 might be
73:24 part of it is to say okay
73:27 if this stuff were to ever leak out buzz
73:30 aldrin is a huge liability in this
73:32 right if this stuff leaks out that the
73:35 moon missions were faked and
73:36 dust everything else is probably faked
73:38 as well
73:39 well a lot of heads will roll won't they
73:42 so if you're in a think tank for the
73:44 military and your or whatever
73:47 whatever government body actually looks
73:49 that over that maybe it's deep state i
73:50 don't know
73:51 and they're like okay we need a
73:53 transitional program
73:55 to dissolve the liability
73:58 then you start spinning off one
74:02 sector at a time cannibalizing the
74:05 employees from nasa
74:06 into these private sector companies so
74:08 they stay employed with what they're
74:10 doing
74:10 and nasa starts just getting smaller and
74:12 smaller and smaller spacex takes a huge
74:14 chunk out
74:16 space x takes a huge chunk out expect
74:19 more chunks to come off of nasa
74:22 jpl well they're actually more probably
74:25 involved with
74:26 space force than you think it's all
74:29 brand new so who knows
74:30 we haven't had a lot of years ago by
74:33 since that was created to create the
74:35 case uh studies and evidence about who's
74:38 doing what
74:39 what i don't know is that since odyssey
74:42 and express
74:44 are definitely maintained by jpl what i
74:47 don't know is
74:48 if spacex supposedly lands something
74:49 there which they have already but i
74:52 don't know if
74:52 they hand it over to gpl for maintenance
74:55 don't know
74:56 you would think the apparatus would be
74:58 very difficult to duplicate
75:00 the other one i want to remind you of is
75:03 that when we have these
75:05 amazing telescope shots
75:08 of mars here from earth or high orbit
75:12 stuff or the sofia
75:15 satellite system inside the 747
75:18 or these huge disk arrays or what have
75:19 you the images we get of mars don't
75:21 match
75:22 remotely the reconnaissance photographs
75:25 that we have where you can go to like
75:26 what is google mars and start surfing
75:28 around mars surface
75:30 the big gash down the middle of the
75:32 planet
75:33 not sure how they explain that i mean it
75:36 makes
75:36 you probably put the grand canyon in
75:39 there and you wouldn't even notice it
75:40 it's so
75:41 gigantic they make it sexy
75:46 they make it sexy now has nasa ever
75:50 been anywhere and done anything
75:53 didn't they supposed to land on what is
75:55 it the the moon titan
75:59 it's a super spinny uh imagery that
76:02 comes in and also they land and
76:04 then the camera only works for a few
76:06 seconds and then it's over
76:08 and it's like oh gosh it's like really
76:11 why didn't you build that out of stuff
76:12 you built the uh
76:14 the mars rovers out of because it it
76:16 lasts way beyond its spec
76:19 nope they keep the liability down by
76:22 making it shut itself off
76:25 how convenient the biggest
76:30 evidence i have that nasa may have done
76:33 something
76:34 correctly with flybys
76:38 are two separate incidences
76:41 one is venus and one is i believe europa
76:46 if i'm right i need to go see neil adams
76:49 uh
76:50 images i think it's europa
76:54 so i was in edward tufte class two times
76:57 took his seminar it's like two days it's
77:00 two days
77:01 a piece edward tufte is a information
77:04 design master
77:06 he takes your information and arranges
77:08 it in images
77:10 sometimes he uses a graph sometimes you
77:12 use something completely brilliant and
77:14 different
77:15 and during his class he tells the story
77:17 about when nasa
77:19 orbited venus and got
77:22 photographs of its surface and did you
77:25 know some sort of radar
77:27 bouncing off the surface to find out
77:28 what venus looked like on the ground
77:31 he said that he because he was inside
77:34 nasa
77:35 where they hired him to re-mulch the
77:36 data of the space shuttle
77:38 accident happening which is a
77:41 fascinating
77:42 part of his class if you ever get a
77:44 chance i don't even know if the guy
77:45 teaches anymore but if he does and he's
77:47 in your neighborhood
77:48 he's worth every penny man it'll change
77:49 your life especially if you're into
77:51 information design of any kind
77:53 but he said that they were so depressed
77:55 that venus was so smooth as a planet
77:59 that they said when we show this
78:01 evidence to the american people slash
78:03 the world
78:04 they're going to be so depressed that
78:05 this data is pretty boring
78:08 and so he said that they actually
78:10 purposely multiplied
78:13 every deviation in the surface of venus
78:16 by 22
78:17 meaning a little mole hill turns into a
78:19 mountain and a little tiny dip
78:21 turns into a valley to make it sexy and
78:24 for those of you who are alive when this
78:26 occurred
78:27 you'll remember hitting the news and
78:28 then doing a 3d fly through of the
78:30 surface of venus
78:31 according to tufty that was all fake and
78:33 he had a lot of disrespect he had a lot
78:35 of
78:36 contempt for nasa in my opinion i don't
78:38 think he would ever say that publicly
78:39 but
78:40 when he mulched the data for the space
78:42 shuttle he couldn't believe they
78:43 launched at 39 degrees fahrenheit when
78:45 the last
78:46 the coldest they'd ever launched before
78:48 was 69 degrees and they had
78:50 major malfunctions with its launch and
78:52 39 was just certain death
78:54 it might uh surprise you to hear that
78:57 they had a meeting for 13 hours the day
78:59 before
79:00 where two scientists from nasa were
79:01 begging
79:03 the administration of nasa not to launch
79:05 that space shuttle on
79:06 february 28th 1986
79:11 or january 20th excuse me i'm going to
79:13 end it this episode with a funny
79:15 story about that but let's move back to
79:16 the story
79:18 the other one is expanding earth theory
79:20 which has been re-prized
79:22 by the national lampoon artist neil
79:24 adams
79:25 who's an extremely intelligent person he
79:28 said that when he went through college
79:29 in 1963 they taught expanding earth
79:31 to everybody and pangaea drift hasn't
79:34 really hadn't really taken off
79:36 yet so what he did was he ran this
79:38 simulation of earth shrinking
79:40 all of its oceans and you'll find out
79:41 all the continents match on all sides
79:43 not just this pangaea drift island
79:45 breaking apart thing but then he did it
79:49 on the footage
79:50 of the moon just pictures of moon from
79:53 telescopes found out all of his theories
79:55 work out perfectly including
79:57 a uh a crater that's on both is cut in
80:01 half on both sides of the sea of
80:02 tranquility
80:03 and when you shrink the sea of
80:04 tranquility pow it makes a perfect
80:06 crater
80:07 because these two used to be joined now
80:10 one of two things is
80:11 happening with nasa either they made it
80:14 to europa
80:15 with a drive-by and took pictures or
80:18 they understand expanding
80:21 earth theory and then pre-calculated the
80:24 surface of europa to be utterly
80:25 ingenious
80:27 it's almost too hard to believe that
80:29 they could
80:31 have pre-calculated this but when he
80:33 took europa
80:34 and used all of his very very
80:37 disciplined
80:38 sliding theories for computer simulation
80:42 you find out that there's a bunch of
80:44 sort of corridors and highways
80:47 if you want to use that term
80:50 on the surface of europa which
80:51 completely reconcile themselves
80:53 the second you put it through neil adams
80:54 algorithms it's shocking it's undeniable
80:58 at least the photographs match his
81:00 theory perfectly
81:02 and i'll show this while we're watching
81:03 the video for those of you on podcast
81:06 so now i'm gonna tell you a little story
81:07 about the day the space shuttle blew up
81:10 i think i might have told this once
81:11 before but it might be a little funny
81:12 anecdote at the end of this
81:14 episode so i'm in high school at the
81:16 time and
81:17 i think i'm in uh my junior year at high
81:20 school
81:21 and i'm with my high school sweetheart
81:22 and we're in this class where we
81:24 simulate being husband and wife and we
81:25 have our checkbook and our ledger and
81:27 we're learning how to basically maintain
81:28 our budgets
81:29 and build a budget and manage our family
81:31 it was super cool
81:33 i had this one teacher that i hadn't had
81:35 before but he's kind of a stern old guy
81:37 and a glass eye like a pirate
81:41 and i needed to go the restroom and
81:43 there's a rule in our high school that
81:45 you can't cut through the library on the
81:46 third floor to go the restroom
81:49 like it's a big inconvenience for them
81:51 but i did it anyway
81:53 i cut through the library go the
81:55 restroom i cut to the library again
81:57 walk right through there and then all of
81:58 a sudden the librarian starts following
82:00 me
82:01 i'm like ah crap i'm in trouble
82:05 and then i'm rocking and she's right
82:06 behind me it's just one of those kind of
82:07 like
82:08 walk of shames i blew you know i got a
82:10 speeding ticket or something right
82:12 i get back to class and i sit down with
82:14 my girlfriend and the t
82:15 and the librarian goes right to my
82:17 teacher i mean the odds of this
82:19 happening are just really crazy once you
82:20 find out what happened
82:22 she whispers to the teacher
82:25 and he stands up and he goes class i
82:27 have something to tell you
82:29 i'm thinking i'm going to get totally
82:32 exposed for what i did
82:35 and then he says the space shuttle
82:36 challenger
82:38 yeah blew up and everybody's dead
82:42 and so in some weird ironic super bad
82:45 movie way i went
82:46 whoo just the space shuttle i'm not in
82:49 trouble
82:51 i know it's horrible but i was very
82:52 young
82:54 so do i think we are on mars
82:58 no i don't do i wish we were on mars
83:01 yeah i do of course just like i wish
83:04 we'd been to the moon
83:06 just like i wish we'd ever built a base
83:08 on the moon that we'd ever in 50 years
83:10 gone back to the moon
83:11 there's a reason why we never try these
83:13 things again and there's a reason why
83:16 rovers were never tested by nasa on the
83:18 closest celestial body we have
83:22 access to which is the moon
83:25 if this is your very first episode let
83:27 me also say the following to close is
83:29 completely off
83:31 if they built a rover platform
83:35 they would have tested it on the moon in
83:37 the sea of tranquility
83:39 because again nasa can land on a dime
83:41 right
83:42 if they saw a rock through a telescope
83:44 according to nasa's capabilities and all
83:45 these aerospace kids are like yeah it's
83:47 so easy to get to the moon
83:48 they would have landed that stuff in the
83:50 sea tranquility
83:52 unpacked and driven straight to
83:55 all six landing sites over the course of
83:58 19
83:59 years and that whole solar panel
84:02 situation
84:03 wouldn't have any contingency plans
84:05 necessary there's no atmosphere on the
84:07 moon
84:08 you just have to worry about kinking up
84:10 its own dust that'd be the only thing
84:11 you'd have to worry about
84:13 but this fluttering technique would
84:14 probably work on the moon because
84:16 there's no giant storms that happen on
84:17 the moon
84:18 as far as we know the moon surface is
84:20 made out of a bunch of dust that doesn't
84:22 have
84:23 conductive properties in it and what a
84:26 celebration that would have been right
84:29 look at those look at the kickstand of
84:30 the lunar lander look at the american
84:32 flag that buzz aldrin himself pounded in
84:35 maybe they wouldn't even get too close
84:36 because he wouldn't want to disturb
84:38 the stuff but we'd see the video cameras
84:40 the solar panels
84:42 the the mirror that's on the moon
84:44 supposedly
84:46 the rovers for 15 16 17 would be up
84:49 there
84:50 let me take your pick plus we'd have
84:52 amazing high-res
84:54 4k 8k 16k videos
84:57 videos not just pictures of the moon
84:59 surface
85:00 well apparently china has discovered
85:02 dirt on the moon actual brown dirt
85:05 amazing so that is your redo
85:09 of the mission to mars hoax
85:12 now in terms of future episodes in this
85:14 season that are going to be space
85:16 oriented we're definitely going to
85:18 reprise our international space station
85:21 observations as well i did a pretty good
85:24 job i think on the first
85:26 first one but i think the uh the show
85:29 technology has increased enough that
85:31 i want to do that one again as well
85:34 must always be new observations right
85:38 anyway if you haven't been to
85:40 deepthoughtsradio.com please go and
85:41 bookmark it
85:43 the only request i'm making nowadays is
85:45 to if you haven't already and for those
85:47 of you have
85:47 i say thank you so much get over to
85:50 bitshoot.com that's
85:54 chute.com give it yourself an account
85:57 definitely subscribe over there it's uh
86:00 the only downgrade is that you don't
86:01 have an app for your tv to watch the
86:03 show
86:03 and it's all 1080p if in case you like
86:06 4k
86:07 devices so it's truly a backup but it
86:10 it's good to get over there and and
86:13 patron a site that is not
86:14 that doesn't have any restriction
86:16 restrictions whatsoever and uploading
86:18 and it just works i mean some of the
86:20 encoding is taking forever right now
86:22 because they're getting overwhelmed
86:24 which is nice but it's a distributed
86:25 computer
86:26 platform that is really just beautiful
86:29 very proud of them
86:31 but over there we have all the video
86:32 audio social media that you'd ever need
86:35 we have an all-new remastered season one
86:36 on his own channel we've got a store
86:38 with two new shirts for season six
86:41 including the all-new deep thoughts
86:43 radio university
86:44 2015 that's for everybody that's when
86:46 the show started
86:48 and for those of you like to contribute
86:49 to the movement super duper appreciate
86:51 it
86:52 we get uh infrequent donations from
86:55 paypal but
86:55 very significant so i appreciate that
86:58 like i think 50 bucks is the best
87:00 most we've ever had but man that's just
87:01 jaw-dropping when it comes through
87:04 and then of course we have patreon now
87:05 patreon gets you a few things
87:07 with the new format in terms of release
87:10 schedule
87:11 what i'm going to be doing to the best
87:13 of my ability is
87:15 recording these at night editing during
87:17 the day
87:18 or sorry edit edit one for the previous
87:21 day this night like i just did the one
87:23 on uh the hutchinson effect which you
87:26 will have already seen
87:28 and so i push it out around i don't know
87:31 anywhere from 11
87:32 o'clock to about five in the morning but
87:34 when you wake up you get to see it
87:35 before everybody else
87:37 and then around two o'clock to three
87:38 o'clock or so i release it to the world
87:40 i've also adjusted the pipeline so that
87:42 everything's ready on the same second
87:44 except bit shoot but shoot
87:48 the way that works just in case you guys
87:49 know you see a lot of youtube channels
87:51 that you like and you don't know why
87:52 things are a little bit weird or wonky
87:54 or when they're going to do their next
87:55 episode
87:56 so i'm just going to say this a few
87:57 times in the bumpers to
88:00 get you guys educated i put it up on
88:02 youtube and they encode a standard
88:04 1080p edition and then all the little
88:06 ones up to
88:08 4k and so i let youtube do the
88:11 encoding for me because they do a great
88:13 job and i use i think it's wonder
88:15 wonder converter or whatever it is to
88:17 yank it down from youtube at 1080p and
88:19 then i push that up to a bit shoot
88:21 then bit shoot can take up to three days
88:24 to encode a video
88:27 and a lot of times it just simply fails
88:28 and there's no indication that it's
88:30 going to fail you're just sitting there
88:31 staring at it all day
88:33 uh episode 524 i believe i had to upload
88:37 that three times before it actually
88:38 worked so big shoot you know on my side
88:41 is a little wonky but it's just a great
88:43 service
88:44 you'll never experience the pain so
88:46 anyway take care of yourself and someone
88:48 else and i'll see you on the next deep
88:50 thoughts
88:50 over now
88:59 [Music]
89:17 [Applause]
89:23 [Music]

89:51 good
89:57 take a turn at the youtube show
