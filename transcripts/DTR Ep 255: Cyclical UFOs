00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today I thought I would
00:39 revisit a subject matter that we talked
00:41 about with a particular angle on it
00:43 hopefully I can go an hour on this one
00:45 this has to do with sort of what I have
00:49 seen my entire life and I know you've
00:50 seen it too which is sort of the
00:51 cyclical UFO fascination and I just want
00:57 a dialogue for about an hour on the
01:00 notion that maybe there's reason why
01:02 it's cyclical what do I mean by cyclical
01:06 there are there are two sides to the UFO
01:11 phenomenon right the unidentified flying
01:13 object phenomenon and it has to do with
01:17 in my opinion you know real world
01:22 observations of these things okay and
01:25 again it doesn't have to doesn't have to
01:27 prove itself as being an
01:29 extraterrestrial object although that's
01:32 where we would say anything that has
01:34 intelligence is flying in the sky would
01:38 have to be either a man-made object or a
01:41 non man-made object meaning anything
01:44 else other than human we would classify
01:46 as an extraterrestrial and again extra
01:50 is supposed to call out to a non
01:52 earth-based being but I would split the
01:55 hair and simply say whoever or whomever
02:00 might be driving these things in our
02:03 world such that we can see them would
02:06 essentially be extra outside of our
02:09 realm of perception so it doesn't matter
02:12 if they're from Alpha Centauri
02:14 or if they're just simply you know
02:19 unobservable by us for whatever
02:21 frequency reason or what-have-you right
02:22 and it is it appears to be okay
02:27 and we're going to go through some of
02:28 the subdermal things that we all talk
02:30 about from time to time but it would
02:33 seem that the the average citizens
02:35 seeing UFOs fuels any response from
02:40 government or military investigations or
02:43 reports or responses to this it never it
02:49 never happens at least to my knowledge
02:51 it doesn't really happen from the
02:53 military to the people now I'm splitting
02:56 a hair there again which is that you
02:58 know yes there have been sightings over
03:00 military installations during ICBM tests
03:05 that then get documented and released
03:08 and we get to see what the military saw
03:10 because military is chasing one in the
03:12 sky what have you but it really stems
03:16 from an average citizen who happens to
03:18 be a soldier I don't mean to say average
03:21 but you know I'm saying we're not we
03:23 know you know we don't like supernatural
03:24 human beings on this planet but just a a
03:27 pilot person in the Navy
03:31 seeing this a soldier that's doing a
03:34 Night Watch
03:34 sees them and then someone translates
03:37 and transmits that observation into the
03:40 apparatus of military and then actions
03:43 are taking place right now sometimes
03:45 with the sky ones the only way that we
03:48 can see them is through a radar blip and
03:50 then someone makes a phone call and goes
03:52 scramble and go find these things okay
03:55 you get my point on the other side of it
03:57 you have organizations that can make a
04:00 lot of money talking about it I'm
04:03 talking about it right I haven't I'm
04:06 trying to think if I ever have seen one
04:09 I you know I'll share the only one I've
04:12 seen sorry the only thing I've seen that
04:15 looked sort of unexplained but it could
04:18 definitely be man-made but place like
04:21 channels on TV History Channel Discovery
04:25 sci-fi channel etc etc
04:28 plenty of youtubers make great videos
04:30 about this and I mean I what's what's
04:32 fascinating and I know that you guys
04:34 know this is that the average video
04:36 documentary made by someone in their
04:39 living room cutting and pasting a bunch
04:41 of stuff together is so much more
04:43 exciting and informative and
04:45 thought-provoking than anything you see
04:47 on cable television cable television you
04:51 know the formula they they exacerbate up
04:54 every emotional arc that's ridiculous
04:57 that doesn't really exist so they can
04:58 cut two commercials so you will have to
05:00 stay you have to sale after the
05:01 commercial to find out it was a complete
05:03 letdown and that's really the reality
05:06 show formula right but it does seem to
05:11 come in cycles and I'm wondering if
05:15 there's any correlation between the
05:19 state of society and these observations
05:22 I'm gonna give you a few examples when
05:26 the Air Force started to exist in
05:29 America and we got out of biplanes and
05:32 and Zeppelin's and that kind of stuff I
05:34 started getting to jet-powered turbine
05:37 powered vehicles then we know that
05:40 there's only especially without the
05:43 internet being available there were a
05:46 lot of citizens of the world especially
05:48 in America I'll stick to America that
05:52 saw things on the sky that hey you know
05:54 did farmer John who didn't watch much
05:58 television because they didn't exist or
06:01 or you know he doesn't listen to the
06:03 radio he doesn't read book because he's
06:04 working so damn hard and he sees some
06:07 covert or even above-ground vehicle fly
06:12 over his farm and he's sitting there one
06:15 day he's looking at he doesn't know what
06:16 it is and so he crafts a story to say
06:19 he's it's a true story he saw something
06:21 he didn't recognize and there you get a
06:24 tiny little story so part of it could
06:28 come out of the evolution of the
06:30 technology then there are people like my
06:32 grandmother in
06:34 roughly about 1920 seeing these cigar
06:39 shaped objects in the sky with a smoke
06:41 trail at the back alright this is a
06:45 woman that never told a tale meaning a
06:47 story that was embellished she didn't
06:50 tell ghost stories and tell anything of
06:52 shooter she lived she's a
06:53 meat-and-potatoes Depression child who
06:55 just thought that the now is the only
06:59 time you really worry about and and she
07:02 sat down with me in one of our last
07:04 sessions in her early 80s and we're
07:08 looking through a lot of photographs and
07:09 what's funny it was I didn't say hey
07:10 grandma have you ever seen a UFO no it's
07:14 for some reason she told me and then she
07:17 had this reserved look on her face like
07:18 yikes don't think I'm crazy and at the
07:24 time I didn't dig in as deep as I could
07:27 because I wasn't the deep thinker that I
07:29 am today I'm glad I can remember that
07:32 and remember it so well I remember
07:35 exactly what sofa we were sitting on
07:37 what house we were in what she was
07:39 wearing her how her face looked I mean
07:41 thank God I've got that memory pretty
07:43 locked in my recollection and then we
07:47 have sort of oddities like the 1947
07:50 Roswell crash where you do have a farmer
07:53 who saw something crash you have an
07:56 archeology teacher with his four or five
07:58 students that saw it crash and everybody
08:01 was trekking to it the next morning when
08:04 the storm cleared and of course the
08:06 farmer is finding all the debris finds
08:08 the disk-like object then he goes and
08:12 reports it to the authorities which then
08:13 scrambles the airforce but in the time
08:16 that between him telling the Air Force
08:18 and some incoming to see it you have a
08:20 group of folks that found it that had no
08:24 idea that it was there they didn't see
08:25 anything the night before and then they
08:27 bump into the archaeologist who brings
08:29 his students in because they said we
08:30 thought it was a plane that crashed and
08:32 again there was a downed aircraft about
08:35 a week earlier and so one of the rumors
08:38 is is that they were seeing this craft
08:41 and that the charred bodies were the
08:44 little teeny tiny four foot bodies that
08:46 were charred were actually
08:48 somehow you know I don't know Zomba fide
08:52 pilots that just shrunk in size because
08:55 they were outside and we know from
08:57 obviously empirical evidence from plenty
08:59 of other horrific situations that the
09:02 human body does not just shrink in a
09:04 week because it's outside we find bones
09:06 all the time and the bones aren't
09:07 smaller right we find bones underneath
09:10 you know construction projects in London
09:13 that have been there for centuries that
09:15 didn't get any smaller great sound like
09:18 Beetlejuice with his little shrunken
09:19 head thing right but there seems to be
09:22 this pattern that I can't quite decipher
09:26 but there are snares some elements to it
09:28 right after Roswell you had this sort of
09:34 pop culture explosion in the notion of
09:37 seeing UFOs and it bled into Hollywood
09:42 now some of you might agree with me that
09:46 that could have been a disinfo SIOP to
09:49 fictionalize UFOs because you have to
09:54 remember there was Buck Rogers on TV or
09:56 I guess in the movies excuse me back in
09:58 the 30s and so you had Hollywood
10:03 productions of aliens having these
10:05 incredible sagas just read HG Wells the
10:07 guy you know the idea of aliens and
10:10 there's plenty of stories in the 1800s
10:11 you've seen tons of them where people go
10:15 to far-off planets and experience things
10:17 there's the old what is it
10:19 when the first movies ever made was the
10:20 one about going to the moon and a little
10:22 rocket which just happened to turn into
10:24 exactly how the Apollo mission was
10:26 conceived nearly 70 years later we had
10:31 the Day the Earth Stood Still we had all
10:33 these B movies we had you know Forbidden
10:36 Planet which I just mentioned recently
10:37 and then it was just sort of on you know
10:39 once it happened you had even Ed Wood
10:42 the famous Ed Wood creating these little
10:44 B movies and we had a blast with those
10:47 narratives you know and so whether or
10:50 not they were real or not sort of got
10:51 lost in the mishmash of the
10:53 entertainment factor of well let's just
10:55 write stories about this in the 60s we
10:58 got star trek as a real deep exploration
11:02 and what it would mean for mankind to
11:04 explore the near reaches of our
11:08 particular galaxy that makes a huge
11:12 difference because then it starts
11:13 informing us on narratives that man has
11:17 potentially created out of thin air you
11:19 know gene Roddenberry did a fabulous job
11:21 thinking this stuff through and then of
11:22 course he got a reprisal in the 70s with
11:24 the movie series starting and then he
11:26 rebooted Star Trek and next generations
11:30 right but it will go to a point where
11:33 during a 9/11 decade
11:36 you really have society focusing away
11:40 from the phenomenon of UFOs now there's
11:44 always a sighting there's always someone
11:45 filming something or claiming to have
11:47 found something so it's not an absolute
11:50 gag on the observations it's just that
11:53 when you have something else to focus on
11:55 you typically focus on it right so the
11:59 question immediately immediately
12:01 presents itself like the following is it
12:04 is it like I guess the word I want to
12:07 say is like is it a mainstay thing of
12:09 our reality that these things exist and
12:11 that we simply get distracted away from
12:14 them or are they a construct of our
12:18 imagination in hopes like I said in my
12:22 season 1 episode the alien promise
12:24 whereby we want to be saved by aliens
12:27 and so when society gets more intense we
12:30 tend to lean towards these rescue
12:32 formulas I just said in my recollection
12:37 the amount of UFO observations during
12:41 say the 9/11 crisis it definitely took a
12:44 hiatus and again that has no factor and
12:48 it wasn't like sci-fi channel stopped
12:50 airing UFO specials during those times
12:54 it's just your average internet buzz on
12:57 you know some New Mexico City
13:00 observation or area 51 stuff it just
13:04 seemed to kind of subside and I could be
13:05 wrong technically speaking and in the
13:08 reality of tracked sightings
13:11 in this time right now like I've said
13:14 into some episodes and I've kind of
13:16 organically Without Really Trying lost
13:21 these circles with friends of mine that
13:23 profess revelations they really feel
13:28 like it's all coming true again in
13:31 Revelations you have such generic
13:33 cautions to society based on most likely
13:36 things that have happened before
13:37 revelations is written that they'll
13:39 always be true they'll always be evil
13:41 people tyrannical people globalists
13:44 trying to take away all the control to
13:45 put it underneath a few banker families
13:48 royal families or what-have-you
13:50 that's always gonna be the case and so
13:52 some things like revelations will always
13:55 seem real so so always gonna be someone
13:57 trying to unify currencies there's gonna
13:59 be someone trying to tag you with the
14:01 symbol of the beast which could be
14:03 literal could be simply the tag you get
14:06 on your hand when you try to leave an
14:07 amusement park so you can get free
14:09 admission back in go to a nightclub they
14:13 mark your hand and you know they'll say
14:16 like oh I can't mark your left hands got
14:17 to be your right hand you know because
14:20 that there's some level of authenticity
14:22 if you find the bartender finds the you
14:26 can drink over 21 symbol on your left
14:27 hand like really it's not it's hardly
14:30 like some Triple DES encryption going on
14:33 there dr. Steven Greer who's made the
14:37 couple movies one's called
14:40 unacknowledged I think the other one is
14:41 what is a serious project where he has
14:44 the little potentially human embryo or
14:48 she's a human infant that was obviously
14:52 brought into this world way too soon and
14:54 it was preserved in a towel by a monk in
14:56 South America then rediscovered a towel
15:00 most likely he was able to wrap the
15:02 fetus in such a tight wrap that it it
15:06 made the skull different and because the
15:09 skull is pretty much cartilage until it
15:11 dries out you know it's not quite
15:12 technically like that but the bones are
15:14 pliable in the infancy stage and it
15:17 hardens as you get older which is why
15:18 kids heads kind of soft when it's born
15:20 right the three plates that union with a
15:23 cartilage scene
15:24 you know the Cartledge scene fades away
15:27 and saucepot fills in and you have a
15:30 normal adult skull but 2001 right in the
15:35 year of 9/11 just prior to 9/11 as I
15:37 understand it he came out with the you
15:40 know the disclosure project which is to
15:42 aggregate a bunch of military and
15:44 government folks that have had top
15:46 clearance at times to discuss their
15:49 sightings and all of these sort of black
15:52 projects that were around the UFO
15:57 phenomenon and we have to acknowledge
15:59 that you know leaders throughout time
16:02 have all acknowledged that this does
16:05 happen there are unidentified flying
16:06 objects and this guy Prince Philip has
16:09 been noted as saying definitely real
16:11 believe Churchill and Truman and
16:15 Eisenhower and you know a lot of folks
16:18 have come out and said that this stuff
16:20 is real the former leaders of various
16:22 intelligence agencies and military
16:24 generals have all said yeah it's
16:25 something we're dealing with but now
16:29 what's interesting about a lot of their
16:31 admissions is that they they will all
16:36 kind of agree at a table that there are
16:38 these things that exist in space or in
16:41 our immediate you know blue sky that are
16:44 unidentified but what you don't hear is
16:46 a lot of quotes about the actual et
16:50 creatures until you go below those folks
16:53 into the sort of individuals that have
16:55 been dealing with wright-patterson Air
16:57 Force Base stuff etc etc and there's
17:00 plenty of these testimonies in these
17:01 deathbed confessions that are starting
17:03 to come out on the internet and if you
17:06 watch them closely and dissect
17:08 everything that they're saying there's a
17:11 tremendous amount of sort of frog DNA as
17:14 what I call it you know Jurassic Park
17:16 when they resurrected the dinosaur they
17:18 didn't have the entire DNA sequence
17:21 again they had no protein patterns so
17:23 you can't just exactly duplicate these
17:25 things but they substituted as part of
17:27 Michael Crichton's original novel frog
17:31 DNA which allowed the feat mailed to
17:33 turn into a female the females turn into
17:34 a male I think they were all females
17:37 right
17:37 ridiculous last thing you want is a
17:40 uterus to exist if you're trying to keep
17:43 things from procreating of the
17:45 interviews I've seen of Stephen Greer's
17:47 amazing effort the overwhelming majority
17:51 that I have seen personally are they're
17:56 kind of like coast to coast interviews
17:58 where you have a gentleman that'll come
18:00 on Coast to Coast AM radio program and
18:03 he'll be telling a tall tale about
18:05 traveling to different planets doing
18:07 time travel all this other stuff and
18:13 their story is pretty airtight up to a
18:17 point and then it just dies because they
18:21 get asked one question that opens up an
18:24 avenue they haven't thought up and
18:25 because they haven't role played they
18:28 don't have the ability to be a dungeon
18:30 master or a game master and fly by to
18:33 see their parents and make it
18:34 indistinguishable like to write new
18:36 fiction that ties in with everything
18:39 they've said before opens up a creative
18:41 narrative doesn't go too far into
18:42 specifics there's a clever reason why
18:45 they don't know things they'll just sort
18:47 of tank and then the questions that come
18:51 in when the callers because if you've
18:53 ever watched if you have excuse me if
18:54 you haven't listened to coast to coast
18:55 am he'll George Noory is currently the
18:59 host they'll introduce someone they will
19:02 get to tell their story they're
19:05 completely rehearsed story start to
19:07 finish and again they've done a little
19:10 bit of due diligence on how to answer
19:11 questions about what they talked about
19:13 and so as a crude example it would be
19:17 you know someone asking me what I did
19:20 with my day and I say I got up early and
19:22 I went down and got breakfast and I had
19:24 an immediate meeting in Los Angeles I
19:26 battled traffic which wasn't too bad did
19:28 my meeting then I decided to visit one
19:31 of my friends there and then I fought
19:32 traffic all the way home and that's my
19:34 story and so what I'm hoping you'll do
19:37 is ask me what I eat for breakfast you
19:39 what was the traffic really like what
19:41 was your meeting about and who did you
19:43 meet with afterwards and how was traffic
19:45 coming home but someone might call up
19:48 and say oh you said you were in Los
19:50 Angeles yeah yeah I was totally in Los
19:51 Angeles
19:52 well did you take the four or five I did
19:54 the well did you go by say Artesia exit
19:58 yeah I totally did absolutely I'll say
20:00 well there was a huge factory fire over
20:02 there and there was a jackknifed truck
20:05 because they're looking at the fire and
20:06 I heard there was like you know a
20:08 fatality and fifty cars piled up what
20:11 was that like and because these folks on
20:15 these shows have sort of lied about most
20:18 of what they're talking about a lot of
20:20 them will cave they'll be unable to say
20:22 oh well yeah there was that and that is
20:25 the Cutler's calling in with empirical
20:27 facts about reality and the person
20:30 telling the story hasn't really been to
20:33 Los Angeles that day so they should have
20:35 added that to the narrative because that
20:37 was a groundbreaking situation to be
20:39 like going to Napa Valley during the
20:40 fires up there telling a story that you
20:43 went up there and you didn't mention the
20:46 fact that the whole place is on fire
20:48 right and so that kind of stuff happens
20:50 a lot in these death-bed confessions
20:53 where it goes up to a point and they'll
20:57 start either having holes in their
21:00 stories or they're missing critical data
21:02 or they will start citing someone else's
21:06 story in the middle of their story
21:08 supposed to be a deathbed confession of
21:10 their experience that's what's valuable
21:12 about a deathbed confession but
21:15 speculation about someone else's life
21:17 well let's get them in to do an
21:19 interview now sometimes the folks that
21:22 they're referring to have passed away
21:23 and so we have a problem there at that
21:26 point we need a story from person a that
21:29 work with that individual and then we
21:31 need some corroborating story from
21:32 another person who doesn't know the
21:34 first person and so we get sort of
21:37 different perspectives that's what
21:38 happened a lot with the Roswell crash
21:40 that started to make me believe that
21:43 despite you know the last 10 years of my
21:47 life really coming to grips with the
21:48 fact that I think that UFOs were more of
21:51 a scare tactic of the
21:52 military-industrial complex to the
21:54 people to make them believe that we have
21:56 alien technology that I didn't think at
21:59 the time that we had when I started
22:02 really getting into the Roswell thing
22:04 and you have to
22:05 this is this is a classic thing that
22:07 happens to people from time to time I
22:09 went in with the absolute objective in
22:12 my Roswell episode to debunk it
22:15 completely and to say this is where it
22:18 all fell apart this is where the
22:20 testimonies don't match because there's
22:23 a there's a corner that has a heat
22:27 personally got a phone call from the
22:29 military to figure out how to preserve
22:30 for a pathologist which is a person
22:33 who's up tops autopsies a child-size
22:35 being and he was very curious why they
22:40 were asking him such a thing and his
22:41 response was like well depending on how
22:43 the pathologist will depending on the
22:45 objective of the pathologist there's
22:47 different ways of preserving a body but
22:49 getting it cold is the number one thing
22:51 and getting it cold quick if it's
22:54 decomposing and so he had a female nurse
22:58 friend at the hospital that then he
23:01 tracked down and realized that she was
23:03 involved with the autopsy of the the
23:08 bodies that were dead now the narratives
23:10 that I heard from the eyewitnesses at
23:12 the Roswell crash said that two were
23:17 dead and her one was completely dead one
23:20 was about to die and the other one was
23:21 pretty much unscathed the other folks
23:25 that have talked about it from the
23:26 military especially in Steven rares
23:28 project added one more body that was
23:32 dead and so it could have been inside
23:34 the vehicle and just not pulled out for
23:36 people to view even the eye test
23:38 witness testimonies of the civilians
23:41 that saw the crash said we didn't climb
23:43 inside this vehicle it was very injured
23:45 and broken apart at one point but we
23:47 didn't go inside so there could have
23:48 been more bodies inside but as I've said
23:50 you know in several episodes the part
23:52 that got me that sort of the clincher
23:54 was the bridge party that was happening
23:56 where I think it's Raimi's that came
23:59 with all the debris he had shown his son
24:02 and apologized I got that name wrong but
24:06 he starts showing his fellow military
24:08 people who are weather balloon experts
24:11 and they said you know this was
24:13 definitely real at three different types
24:15 of material and these rulers with this
24:17 writing on it
24:18 which was then transcribed you can look
24:20 it up on the internet and look at
24:21 potentially potentially they're not
24:23 lying you're looking at alien writing
24:26 which was later cleansed to say that it
24:29 was a tape from a toy company in New
24:32 York and so when we say okay show us the
24:34 tape like a real preserved roll of this
24:38 tape not your memory of the state but
24:40 the real preserve role of this tape and
24:42 its design they can't come up with it
24:44 but isn't it fascinating that there is
24:47 no alien crash that I'm aware of that
24:52 has the infamy and the the level of
24:57 documentation and eyewitnesses of the
25:01 1947 Roswell crash there are soldiers in
25:06 the disclosure project that talk about
25:08 crashes that they have seen and that
25:10 they get them getting roughed up again
25:12 by some foreign agency that showed up in
25:15 vehicles that seem to have anti-gravity
25:18 propulsion systems and there you know
25:21 interrogated for 14 hours and telling
25:24 them that they're gonna get killed and
25:27 poking them in the chest with m16s and
25:29 all kinds of wild stuff so it would be
25:32 either that they got a grip on all
25:33 crashes right and they always happen in
25:36 remote areas of the world the amount of
25:42 sightings with all kinds of people that
25:44 said they saw something in the
25:45 wilderness and there's a bunch of lights
25:47 and this kind of thing that's uh there's
25:51 a lot of those but there's nothing like
25:53 Roswell nothing like it at all that I'm
25:56 aware of right there is an incident at
25:58 murray island i believe it's the way
26:00 they call it and i'm gonna do an episode
26:02 on that because i found it amazing
26:05 videos at my smoke shop and someone
26:08 created it i think it was maybe
26:10 jaren ism had created a compilation
26:12 about the murray island thing and i
26:14 cannot find it in his library and i've
26:15 posted in his discussion section to help
26:18 me with the link with no reply because
26:20 the guy gets too bombarded by requests
26:23 but he had a video that tied the murray
26:26 island incident which i think is off the
26:29 coast east coast around new york area
26:32 and it's it he was linking in all the
26:35 way into the administration and the
26:37 masonic guys and the masons and all
26:39 kinds of wild devil worshipping weird
26:41 stuff and so it was so chaotic that i
26:46 needed to sit down and watch it take
26:48 notes and kind of figure out where these
26:50 connections were made as the video was
26:52 started before i got in the room so
26:55 there was some there were some
26:57 connections at the very beginning that i
26:59 missed and so i had to figure out why
27:00 this would be connected to a bunch of
27:02 weird fake churches in brooklyn new york
27:04 and so on and so forth maybe was even
27:07 the bronx the other link to sightings
27:11 has to do with the fact that you know
27:15 there's been this assertion by the
27:17 military and again it doesn't explain a
27:20 lot of things but when we finally split
27:23 the atom that somehow the you know the
27:26 forces that be outside this planet said
27:30 oh you're not allowed to take these into
27:32 space you're not allowed to mess around
27:34 because this actually hurts our stuff
27:36 you sort of the assertion and you know
27:40 there there have been interesting
27:42 sightings around rocket launches where
27:44 you have what looks to be like a sort of
27:48 like a white fly it's obviously much
27:50 bigger than a fly that's flying around
27:53 these devices and seemingly you know
27:59 zapping them taking you know disarming
28:01 the nuclear warhead etc etc there have
28:04 been claims that these vehicles fly over
28:07 missile silos and turn them off and
28:09 deactivate them again they're just words
28:12 so far
28:14 unfortunately there's crop circles crop
28:18 circles seem to be extremely cyclical
28:21 right they come and they go and then
28:24 there's obviously universities that go
28:28 out and do them on purpose there are
28:30 artists that go out and create a
28:31 beautiful crop circles with these
28:32 amazing geometric shapes but they're
28:34 doing it in public eye even if they do
28:36 them in the middle of the night because
28:38 they don't really own the land and the
28:39 farmer is going to be a little pissed
28:40 off that their crop let's push down
28:43 thank god they don't have to cut it
28:45 but they relator reveal yeah we did this
28:48 and so it's like okay crop cycles can be
28:51 made by man and they could be extremely
28:54 lab elaborate and gorgeous don't have to
28:57 be Ely ins
28:58 doesn't mean if an alien did the first
29:01 one we couldn't figure out how they did
29:03 it and and copy it now there's this
29:05 there's this technicality for the way
29:08 that supposedly the UFOs do it versus
29:12 the way that students do it and students
29:15 they get a board and a rope and the
29:19 board is about six to ten feet depending
29:22 on their desire and they put a rope down
29:25 to both sides and they hold the rope
29:27 with their two hands and they put the
29:28 foot one foot on the ground one foot on
29:30 the on the board and then they they Pat
29:34 down the earth in a particular direction
29:36 shape and vector and it creates the
29:39 pushdown grass now the technicality I
29:42 heard of probably in the 90s late 80s
29:44 was that the UFO ones actually
29:51 weave the grass together like a like a
29:57 braided hair thing and that when humans
30:00 do it it doesn't work like that I don't
30:03 know I've never seen a crop circle in my
30:05 life I think it's also fascinating that
30:08 they happen to have they happen to
30:10 either happen in England which is I
30:12 think where they first started to show
30:14 up I could be wrong but I think that's
30:15 what I've always heard and then it
30:18 happens close to universities in the
30:20 United States of America and it's kind
30:22 of an East Coast thing but what's
30:25 strange is growing up in Kansas with
30:26 tons of crops like wheat and hay to feed
30:31 the animals we have amazing
30:34 opportunities to have crop circles sewn
30:38 into the ground by UFOs right and
30:41 because UFOs typically appear in remote
30:43 areas never over you know well I
30:47 shouldn't say that but you know we
30:48 haven't had them fly down these the main
30:52 street of Boston you know we've had them
30:54 over the Capitol building
30:57 of Washington DC these flying lights
31:01 which is very strange but you would just
31:04 think that it would happen in the rural
31:05 areas as well be a unifying thing it
31:08 would happen all over the world and not
31:09 just in certain areas just a hunch right
31:12 you also have the the hoaxsters the
31:16 tricksters and they I know absolutely
31:20 positively frustrate the the UFO
31:23 community is looking for the real deal
31:24 and the sort of telltale sign about a
31:30 hoaxster is that you will have videos
31:33 that emerge on the internet quite often
31:35 where you have a whole group of people
31:38 looking at supposedly a UFO it's
31:42 something flying in the air there's one
31:43 over wright-patterson Air Force Base the
31:45 middle of last year which is sort of
31:46 this flying wing that was very
31:47 interesting
31:48 husband and wife now this one was
31:51 cooperated by supposedly someone with 35
31:53 millimeter camera in a different area
31:55 but it's a broad daylight sighting but
31:57 you have a husband and wife kicking off
31:59 the real video of this thing and of
32:03 course the husband's camera doesn't work
32:05 on his cell phone okay every cell phone
32:07 has two cameras right you could figure
32:10 out a way to get it to work somehow when
32:12 you're seeing the most amazing thing on
32:13 planet Earth would you really sit next
32:15 to it with your recording device and go
32:17 oh do you got you got this okay I won't
32:19 get my camera out then since you're
32:21 filming it it's you know Jesus Christ
32:24 coming back from the dead and if you
32:26 know as long as you're filming it I'm
32:27 cool with not filming it really right
32:31 over the last 15 years we've had a new
32:36 emergence of computer-generated UFO
32:39 sightings where you have students at
32:44 colleges that are going to school for
32:46 special effects and of course they want
32:48 to have a very creative project to you
32:52 know to show their students show the
32:54 teachers get good grades and obviously
32:57 when you create a project to master a
32:59 skill well let me tell you the secret
33:01 the secret is is that it's more
33:02 interesting if you have an interesting
33:05 project so if you're trying to fake
33:07 something it's been faked 100 times in
33:09 whatever
33:10 but hey man you're gonna you're gonna
33:11 create a UFO phenomenon you maybe you
33:14 don't even start it off to deceive
33:15 anyone you just create it you're doing
33:18 all kinds of motion traction tracking
33:20 cool stuff and then all of a sudden you
33:24 realize that people see it and start to
33:26 freak out over it and think it's real
33:27 and then you go with it and then we have
33:31 sort of a UFO thing that doesn't have to
33:33 do with something flying in the air
33:35 we have artwork and artifacts that seem
33:38 to point towards someone else
33:41 participating in the in the creation of
33:44 the earth
33:45 you have cave art and art on the side of
33:51 rocks in South America key parts you
33:54 know everywhere and they seem to have
33:58 the ability to render themselves pretty
34:00 good and so when you look at all the
34:03 stick figures that are the people some
34:05 of them are very elaborate you know
34:06 they're hunting and hunting you know
34:08 wild animals and you see sort of again
34:10 the ecosystem of their world and then
34:13 all of a sudden you see them draw a
34:16 character that's much taller and has
34:20 bizarre limbs and sort of looks like I
34:23 don't know sort of some hybrid of a grey
34:27 alien as it might be says more sort of
34:29 almond eyed things there are wooden
34:32 artifacts of sort of these serpent type
34:37 creatures so you take sort of a lizard
34:39 and you take a grey alien and you put
34:41 them together David Icke has his shaman
34:44 in South Africa that has these artifacts
34:48 where a mail render it's like a wood
34:52 mail rendering of an alien with almond
34:54 eyes impregnating a female who has been
34:58 carefully rendered as a human so when
35:02 you're looking at their craft you're not
35:04 looking at a mistake and someone saying
35:06 oh well they probably just couldn't do I
35:07 fell you know I look at the other one
35:10 and the same
35:11 made in the same timeframe and they seem
35:13 to have humans down really really well
35:15 so if they intentionally made a serpent
35:17 creature but doing it intentionally
35:19 it could be someone eating peyote and
35:22 having a wild experience could be some
35:23 mythos that has been handed down that is
35:26 their God belief you know again we talk
35:30 about every once in a while on the show
35:31 the Egyptians that have gods that are
35:33 sort of you know they have heads of
35:35 various beasts like ant eaters and hawks
35:39 and all kinds of stuff blue skin regular
35:42 skin black skin olive skin no one would
35:45 ever accuse the artists of Egypt is
35:48 being incapable of rendering something
35:50 perfect when they have you know giant
35:53 statues of their pharaohs a beautifully
35:57 rendered you know faces that are several
36:01 meters wide tall that are perfect
36:04 perfectly rendered super hard granite we
36:09 have artifacts in paintings you know I
36:14 believe the Mona Lisa has a little one
36:15 but there's all kinds of the Middle Ages
36:18 sort of paintings and renderings that
36:21 have what appears to be flying craft in
36:25 the air in the background in the sky
36:30 okay
36:31 so they can render a human being photo
36:33 real but they they're somehow getting
36:35 this other thing wrong symbolically
36:37 what's interesting about finding out
36:40 that our space agencies have lied about
36:42 a tremendous portion of what they've
36:45 accomplished is that when you go back
36:49 and then reevaluate all of the entities
36:52 in space that they say they have a
36:54 complete grasp over then you start to go
36:58 well maybe this is all fake a comet was
37:02 a very interesting thing Halley's Comet
37:05 which I was actually privileged to see I
37:07 saw Halley's and hale-bopp but as a kid
37:10 in the mid 80s I saw Halley's Comet come
37:13 by and you know what is the what is the
37:15 misconception about a comet in and
37:18 ironically my high school mascot was a
37:21 comet the tail always goes away from the
37:24 Sun and from the world of ether
37:27 particles that I profess it makes
37:29 complete sense the Sun is a huge
37:32 emitting
37:33 force and if you have something that's
37:36 pliable like a ball of snow and in suit
37:39 it's gonna push off part of the veneer
37:41 in in that particular direction but what
37:44 is the story of Halley's Comet because a
37:46 friend of mine he's not super deep into
37:48 astronomy asked me a really fundamental
37:49 question and he said how could this
37:52 thing keep coming back every 75 years
37:55 and God knows where it goes after that
37:57 and not simply burn away at some point
38:01 how does it always have fuel on it to
38:04 create a tail
38:06 forget the physics of where it's going
38:08 and what have you how is it able to do
38:10 this wouldn't it eventually evaporate
38:13 now it may simply be the the attrition
38:15 of it's a big it was a gigantic ball at
38:18 one point and it's just frying away but
38:20 what if it wasn't a common what if it
38:23 was something else
38:25 the idea that it would be a UFO and have
38:28 a tail is sort of weird right there were
38:31 some some sort of I guess you would call
38:35 them amateur astronomers that are pretty
38:37 serious in England that had a press
38:39 conference once and they were taking all
38:41 of the photographs of the Sun that were
38:45 pulled in from various agencies and
38:47 every single digital anomaly on the
38:49 shots they said were motherships and
38:51 stuff and you're talking about ships
38:53 that would be almost the size of a small
38:55 moon it was just sort of ridiculous but
38:58 they weren't moon shaped they were like
39:00 you know aircraft carrier shapes but it
39:02 was just a digital anomaly most likely
39:03 in the photograph who knows they just
39:06 didn't seem to have an organic signature
39:08 it seemed to have a blemish in the
39:10 photograph if you know anything about
39:11 interpreting digital imagery okay but
39:15 then my friend asked me a very
39:16 interesting question because the
39:19 International Space Station the ISS
39:21 which a lot of us believe is largely
39:25 potentially faked because of all the
39:28 weird you know cables and stuff that we
39:32 see go see my episode on the ISS to see
39:35 actual examples of these of this footage
39:37 if you guys are coming in off audio you
39:39 want to hit YouTube at some point but
39:43 you know when I was in high school my
39:45 teacher told me in astronomy
39:47 said look and this was repeating in
39:49 college that when they take a a really
39:53 high-powered telescope and they film the
39:56 atmosphere and they calculate how much
39:58 of the sort of view rectangle that
40:00 they're looking at has a certain level
40:03 of circumference of the earth right
40:05 accounted for that when they see the
40:08 constant bombardment of rocks and debris
40:11 from space which is again it's supposed
40:12 to be a vacuum the average calculation
40:14 of a permanent collision with outer
40:18 foreign bodies was a hundred million
40:20 foreign objects hit the atmosphere of
40:23 Earth per minute you could half that and
40:27 you're still your mind should be a
40:29 little bit blown all right
40:30 so when you think about a bunch of
40:32 satellites in space and ISS Space
40:34 Station out there the Hubble telescope
40:37 that's got a you know a precise spy
40:41 satellite lens looking deep into space
40:42 which is really the the project Aurora
40:45 in a 747 or is it Ororo is it no sorry
40:49 it's a Sophie Sofia excuse me got that
40:52 wrong you start to ask the question if
40:55 you've ever seen the movie gravity with
40:59 Sandra Bullock you start to see this
41:03 notion of how could that be up there
41:05 without getting hit routinely by at
41:09 least one or two rocks a day if you have
41:12 a hundred million out there now some of
41:15 you might say well it's the Van Allen
41:16 belts to completely protect alright but
41:19 I'm willing to bet at least a baseball
41:22 sized thing is going to make it through
41:23 the Van Allen belts every once in a
41:24 while as we see shooting stars up there
41:26 or falling stars this space station
41:31 would be ripped apart by at least one or
41:35 two of these things or at least be a
41:36 single incident where a piece of debris
41:38 went through one of these vessels at
41:41 35,000 miles an hour roughly and you
41:43 know when you're hit by something that
41:45 quickly there's a couple things that can
41:48 happen one it punches an absolute pure
41:50 hole through the device but if there's
41:52 any resistance as a structural integrity
41:56 issue you know what if a
42:00 a single meteorite came in and went
42:03 lengthwise down the ISS down one of the
42:07 big tubes and it's it's hitting the wall
42:10 and so it's just literally like the
42:12 bullet that shot through the apple or
42:13 the bullet that shot through the coke
42:14 bottle it is tearing a hole and a split
42:18 fraction of a millisecond tearing it
42:22 apart
42:22 all the bodies inside well they're gonna
42:25 get torn apart most likely even just the
42:28 the concussive wave of a force is going
42:33 to probably invert human bodies just the
42:36 shockwave of it you know one of things I
42:40 was told a long time ago was that when
42:44 you shoot animals with guns you do have
42:49 various regions of the body that you
42:50 will shoot them and it penetrates the
42:52 body and they will bleed out the
42:54 hemorrhage and they die but if you shoot
42:56 for instance there was a gentleman who
42:58 had shot a bear to death with a 357
43:00 Magnum and he emptied the gun into the
43:04 skull of the bear when the bear died big
43:09 giant grizzly bear and he I guess the
43:14 taxidermist or the scientist that looked
43:16 at this bear afterwards said you know
43:18 what the bullets barely penetrated the
43:20 skull of the bear and it didn't look to
43:22 be a fatal wound but what it did look
43:25 like was that the shockwave of the
43:26 bullet bouncing off the skull most
43:28 likely traumatized the brain cavity so
43:30 badly that it probably had its nervous
43:34 system paused enough that it actually
43:36 lost consciousness and died sort of like
43:38 the venom in a black mamba as I've heard
43:41 it described it he really just pauses
43:43 the immune system and the human body
43:45 from a toxic toxic shock standpoint and
43:48 you die of it but he went on to ask me
43:50 he goes how do they predict meteor
43:54 showers and immediately my brain goes
43:59 well these things are cyclical and we
44:02 have watched them in the past and we
44:03 figured out their cycles and da da da da
44:05 da and then I started thinking well
44:07 that's an interesting story that I was
44:09 told as a kid but honestly we're talking
44:12 about essentially invisible
44:14 of mass you know whatever it is iron
44:17 rocks or whatever it is that because
44:20 we're never in the same spot in the
44:23 galaxy from any moment in time you know
44:26 we are rotating we are let me get in
44:29 heliocentric standard models again you
44:32 want to use there if you're Flat Earth
44:34 or just use their science against them
44:36 and everything 666 right we're spinning
44:40 in a 666 rate we're going around the Sun
44:42 and a six six six rate the Sun is
44:44 spinning through the galaxy so we
44:48 shouldn't be in any physical location
44:50 that would create these cyclical
44:53 predictions but what's interesting is
44:56 having gone out and looked at him
44:58 several times especially the young man
44:59 in the 80s they happen on the nights
45:02 that they say so that is just that easy
45:05 which it might be or there's some other
45:08 reality to where we are that maybe it's
45:12 some anomaly that's happening is a
45:13 defect of our reality and it's like yeah
45:15 this is a meteorites yes absolutely
45:18 and remember you've never seen a meteor
45:22 I ever go up from the line of sight in
45:26 front of you you always see it go down
45:28 and in a heliocentric ball you would
45:32 most definitely see them go up just as
45:35 much as you'd see them go down then you
45:38 know they do go left and right but
45:40 they're always on a downward vector
45:42 I've seen them several times and I've
45:46 seen a couple really good ones on this
45:49 block in the last 12 months
45:50 and a lot of other people saw them like
45:52 oh my god you know it's like a big
45:54 diagonal down the big ones that landed
45:57 over Russia they're going down there was
46:00 the one that happened in 2018 somebody
46:03 supposedly filmed a meteorite hitting
46:04 the ground and in people say it's an
46:07 energy weapon because we've had very
46:09 selective bizarre forest fires and house
46:12 fires in Santa Ana and Calistoga up
46:15 north so the back on subject here are
46:19 UFO sightings appear to have attention
46:24 put on them in these cycles
46:27 and it seemed that when we were in the
46:32 sort of baby boomer era we just gotten
46:36 out of World War two the sightings went
46:38 off the charts which is and it really
46:40 blew up after the Roswell crash and so a
46:43 lot of psychologists will say look it's
46:45 because it was introduced into the
46:46 lexicon of man and that may be true but
46:49 now let me let me throw something at you
46:52 here douglas adams the author of
46:56 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy in his
46:58 last two books which were reprised by
47:00 Dirk Maggs of the BBC who had the
47:04 privilege of working with in some light
47:08 capacities I hired one of the sound
47:09 engineers to work for my a game company
47:11 Paul we're super talented people he well
47:18 when they reprise the the second two
47:20 books which was about 20 years after the
47:23 originals were created for the BBC which
47:26 is the way to when you want to hear that
47:27 story you want to hear the BBC
47:28 recordings and not the the books because
47:32 the books are all messed up in terms of
47:35 timeline but anyway there's this scene
47:37 where they hid the I believe it's the
47:42 starship heart of gold or at least one
47:45 of the vehicles outside of a soccer
47:47 batch yeah our football match as they
47:51 call it over there and so you have I
47:55 believe Arthur Dent is there and I think
47:57 it's Ford Prefect coming to pick him up
47:59 and he said you know let's go let's go
48:01 and he said I'm done with his whole
48:03 thing you know the first few books got
48:04 me right technically and eventually
48:07 agrees to go with him and he says well
48:09 where's your spaceship and he goes it's
48:11 right over there and Arthur Dent looks
48:13 over there and I believe I got the
48:15 characters correct and he goes well how
48:18 can you park a spaceship right next to
48:20 everybody and he goes well because they
48:22 don't believe they can see it they don't
48:24 believe that it exists so I can park it
48:26 right there in plain sight and they
48:29 don't see it and Arthur that's like oh
48:31 my god and so I think there's even a
48:33 comp little couple lines of comedy where
48:35 he's walking on going can't you see this
48:37 can't you see this and no one sees it
48:38 they get in the ship and they leave
48:42 how many times have you had a word that
48:46 you learned and as soon as you learned
48:49 the word you hear it all the time and
48:51 you're like my god was this something
48:53 that went on the national news hey
48:55 there's a new word everyone use it and
48:57 this is how you use it in a sentence and
48:58 everyone starts using that word know
49:01 it's that you finally have that opened
49:04 up in your mind and now you hear it and
49:06 now you use it what if UFOs are merely
49:12 visible when something irreconcilable
49:17 happens a crash a Roswell crash happens
49:22 the military Air Force newspaper in
49:25 Roswell New Mexico reports it on the
49:27 seventh page or something flying saucer
49:30 crashed alien bodies recovered data and
49:32 in the world suddenly has it translated
49:35 into their mechanisms of understanding
49:38 which is a newspaper and now the world
49:40 looks up and the hall goes holy [ __ ]
49:43 they're everywhere
49:44 but because the military comes in and
49:47 says huh no no it's just a weather
49:48 balloon trying to sense you know there's
49:52 a nuclear bomb tests in Russia which on
49:58 its face is kind of silly right okay so
50:00 you you discover that a bomb was
50:03 detonated in Russia and you got these
50:05 waves coming through the atmosphere and
50:07 then suppose you can kind of calculate
50:08 the magnitude of the mushroom cloud and
50:12 that kind of thing yeah I guess that
50:14 that has some value and that's I guess
50:16 the only way you can do it and it's
50:18 really strange because you too did not
50:19 exist to conduct surveillance overhead
50:22 right so then it opens up the mind
50:24 people can see it just by having it hurt
50:28 again I'm just riffing here what if
50:31 that's the case Hollywood swoops in and
50:34 says no no no no don't look up look over
50:37 here come to the silver screen get
50:40 yourself some popcorn something to drink
50:42 sit down and we will totally marry the
50:45 two concepts together Day the Earth
50:47 Stood Still Forbidden Planet Star Trek
50:49 and a million other little B movies that
50:51 were made back in the day
50:53 and we will take over the narrative of
50:55 what they could be and there was going
50:57 to be humanoid beings and you don't need
51:03 to worry don't envision them that being
51:06 grey aliens or anything like that I am
51:09 not sure where the grey alien thing came
51:12 about I seem to believe you know one of
51:17 the first episodes of Star Trek has the
51:19 sort of big veiny testicle head guy
51:22 right who communicates through tell can
51:25 telepathic communication and I think the
51:29 even had telekinesis in this but it
51:31 starts to take it down to our level and
51:33 make it silly
51:34 and then we no longer want to or or
51:40 maybe we're not capable of resonating to
51:43 just the generic theory that there's
51:44 things in space but you know I will fall
51:47 back to my grandmother's viewing to say
51:49 at 12 at 8 to 12 years old when she said
51:53 she started seeing these things with her
51:54 sister I don't think that in the 20s
51:59 okay
51:59 she's born in 1912 so by 1920 you didn't
52:04 have Buck Rogers stuff she was in the
52:06 Midwest with no money that you know that
52:08 she wasn't seeing all of that input so
52:13 whatever saw whatever she saw she saw
52:15 another friend of mine said that his
52:19 father was a test pilot I mentioned this
52:20 once before as well he was flying and he
52:25 eventually got injured in a test fight
52:27 and couldn't no longer fly as a test
52:30 pilot you know flying for celebrities
52:32 all over Japan and flew Bob Hope around
52:35 the the USO but before his career was
52:41 over as the test pilot he said he was up
52:42 really really high and which I probably
52:46 at the time was maybe 40,000 feet or so
52:48 and he said this disc that was at least
52:52 20 meters across which is you know 60
52:56 feet flew right up to his his craft and
52:59 it had like a pulsing disco light kind
53:02 of thing around the outer rim and he got
53:05 so close to him that
53:06 he was terrified it was gonna kill him
53:08 just by hitting him and making him
53:12 trying to do an evasive maneuver which
53:13 at that height for the particular
53:15 vehicle he was flying which we have no
53:16 idea what it was that you know he would
53:19 just disintegrate up there I'm not
53:22 supposed to make big fast right turns
53:23 and an sr-71 right and he held that
53:27 story until his deathbed literally and
53:31 because he didn't want his his relatives
53:34 to know because he you know it's part of
53:36 like being nuts or it's scary now a lot
53:39 of guys have for the Roswell crash
53:43 there's countless stories of the
53:46 individuals that participated in that
53:47 and who actually saw the aliens because
53:51 they had no again precursors from
53:56 fictional things in their mind when they
53:59 really saw I'm just going with their
54:01 story when they really said they saw
54:03 these alien bodies it freaked them
54:05 completely out and the unifying word
54:08 that went across several these
54:10 individuals was creatures and terrifying
54:14 and scary that could have been their
54:18 interpretation of what they saw again
54:20 without really communicating with them
54:22 as those individuals okay so let's say
54:25 that they'll say that the story of the
54:27 surviving Roswell member of him dying in
54:30 1952 which I recently saw reaffirmed I
54:35 believe it was an interview and the
54:37 disclosure project let's say that guy
54:40 continued existing but a lot of these
54:42 folks didn't have additional access
54:44 after the first eyewitness situation now
54:46 there's all these stories about Truman
54:48 and area 51 and Eisenhower and area 51
54:52 and Carter and all these individuals
54:54 trying to get in and see this stuff and
54:56 because the presidents of the United
54:58 States are considered temporary
54:59 employees they are sort of on an
55:02 intelligence level on need-to-know basis
55:05 so they can't get raw access to this
55:08 data we have to filter all this stuff so
55:12 the question at the end of this episode
55:14 that I want to pose is the following
55:17 prior to
55:20 even Greer's disclosure project when I
55:24 had my own little encounter which I'm
55:27 going to give you again because it's
55:28 been dozens and dozens of episodes back
55:32 it well let me just tell you my
55:35 experience and again to this day I'm a
55:40 little miffed at what happened there is
55:42 an explanation that could explain the
55:44 whole thing I was reading I was living
55:48 with a girlfriend in Oxnard California
55:50 in a beach house like three houses back
55:53 from the sand and I had been at the
55:57 bookstore and I was buying probably some
56:00 techy book or something and I looked
56:03 down in the bargain bin thanks to the
56:05 front it was Abby Dalton's book and I
56:07 see the cover of Whitley Strieber book
56:10 communion before I go on I think Whitley
56:13 Strieber is largely 99% embellished I
56:16 think maybe he had a real experience at
56:18 one point and then like so many folks
56:21 they want more and so they create them
56:23 fictionally he could be telling the
56:25 truth but he seems to have every
56:29 experience that everyone else has so if
56:30 you were to go up to him and say oh my
56:32 gosh you know I had a great lien pour me
56:34 a coke in the kitchen he'll say oh me
56:37 too and he tells a whole story about how
56:39 he is so he seems to usurp everyone
56:41 else's experiences in his books but
56:42 whatever but I see the cover of this
56:45 book and there's this Luke I'm your
56:49 father moment for me which is that every
56:52 time I've seen that big veiny head thing
56:53 and a big giant skull alien alma night
56:57 thing in all the seventies specials and
57:00 you know they're talking about aliens
57:01 and stuff my gut my gut had this
57:05 horrible feeling of that is wrong even
57:07 as a child and it bothered me and when I
57:12 saw the more flat thin head creature on
57:15 the front of this book my brain just had
57:18 angels sing' and it was like I don't
57:21 know what that book is but I'm gonna buy
57:22 it because someone finally rendered them
57:24 the way that they look which is a beige
57:26 gray which is a female I get the book no
57:30 idea what it's about
57:31 I know Whitley Strieber from
57:34 cats I'd the movie only cuz my father
57:36 obsessed on the movie but I didn't
57:38 realize at the point that he had written
57:39 this book and I take it home and I start
57:43 reading it to my girlfriend at night we
57:45 took turns right which means I read 80%
57:47 of the time on probably the last 30
57:51 pages of the book it starts getting a
57:52 little spooky where he starts talking
57:54 about missing time where he would kind
57:57 of be going home from work and then all
58:00 sudden it was daytime and it was
58:01 nighttime in one second later and he
58:02 realized he lost two hours or 30 minutes
58:04 and then this alien kind of started
58:06 tracking on him and stuff so the last
58:08 pages that we read before this event
58:10 occurred I go to bed that night it was
58:13 near Christmas time and there's a power
58:15 amplifier that I have for some musical
58:17 instruments down in front of me and I I
58:21 wake up sitting on this amplifier which
58:24 was our Christmas tree and we don't have
58:27 a lot of gifts between the two of us and
58:29 I had I believe I had seen the gifts I'm
58:33 not one that tries to figure out what
58:34 things are I think that's kind of shitty
58:35 but my girlfriend at the time because my
58:38 birthday is in August had gifted me for
58:42 my birthday
58:43 some big LPS and custom 12-inch LPS
58:46 of prints because she was from Queens
58:48 New York and so she went back to New
58:50 York went to some really cool vinyl
58:51 stores and brought me these albums and
58:53 we still bought albums at the time but
58:55 it was kind of fading out this is about
58:57 1990 and so I wake up in my beach house
59:05 I'm sitting on this thing I'm sitting my
59:07 underwear and I'm looking straight at
59:08 this grey alien who's the same height as
59:11 me well a little bit taller his eyeballs
59:13 are about dead-on with me and I look
59:15 over and my kitchen table was built by
59:18 my girlfriend I was on those duty or
59:20 self things we can varnish it's kind of
59:21 old country table and on there we had a
59:25 puzzle and over by the puzzle there's
59:28 these little guys like the ones in front
59:30 of me and they're removing SuperDuper
59:32 fast it's it's like they're either
59:33 looking at the puzzle they're building
59:35 it or something of course we didn't wake
59:36 up with it built but they're over there
59:38 and then everyone so on a cycle this
59:41 little guy goes around the room and the
59:46 guy in front of me
59:48 seemed like it was a male and again I
59:51 can't really say I saw his mouth move
59:53 but from all the dream stuff I've told
59:56 you about us not having our bodies this
59:59 was a touch touchy-feely vision it was
60:01 not like the average dream where you're
60:03 sitting there and you don't feel your
60:05 body I felt my body very distinctly okay
60:08 he he says are you gonna be okay and I'm
60:12 kind of groggy it's like you're waking
60:14 up out of medication right and I said I
60:16 guess and I said no I said sorry that's
60:19 the second I said he goes they're gonna
60:22 be okay and I said well no one's gonna
60:23 believe me and when he said are you be
60:27 okay put his little hand on my shoulder
60:28 it was his right arm on my left shoulder
60:31 and I could feel it touched me very
60:33 distinctly okay and I said well no one's
60:37 gonna believe me knee and he goes what
60:39 would make them believe you and I said I
60:41 don't know I'm liking this kind of pissy
60:43 melancholy mode he reaches down between
60:46 my legs and he pulls up a present
60:48 because if I told you what was in this
60:50 president would they believe you I said
60:52 I guess but I'm staring at a flat square
60:55 present and I know that's an album
60:58 because that's what she gets me she got
61:01 me several and we and it was like it
61:03 wasn't just Christmas that she would do
61:05 this she'd get me one cuz one came out
61:07 you know here's another album okay so I
61:11 closed my eyes
61:12 oh sorry he tells me what it is he goes
61:14 this is origami paper okay in my brain
61:17 at the time I had never seen origami
61:19 paper in my life and I would think
61:20 origami paper be by 11:00 and so I'd
61:25 know almost nothing about it and so I
61:27 closed my eyes and I wake up on the side
61:29 of my bed
61:30 the clock is one two zero zero and as
61:33 well as moments where you don't have any
61:34 other visions you'd have any other
61:35 dreams you just close your eyes and you
61:36 wake up and I've had that happen maybe
61:38 three or four times in my entire
61:39 lifetime where I laid down the bed close
61:41 my eyes wake up in a boom it's good
61:43 morning I can hear her cleaning up stuff
61:48 out front in the kitchen so I go out my
61:51 underwear I go around I sit down in
61:53 front of this thing and without saying
61:57 anything to her I touched the present
61:59 it's right there in front of me any
62:01 soft and I looked at her and I said well
62:04 you won't believe this but I just
62:06 dreamed that an alien told me what what
62:09 was in this present being extremely
62:11 confident that I cannot guess something
62:13 I've never seen before she smiles and
62:15 she's cleaning out a pan and she goes
62:17 over yeah I said yeah I said he told me
62:20 this is origami paper and she just stops
62:23 and her only comment was well he better
62:26 not have told you what was in your big
62:27 gift and I'm stood there going don't you
62:31 think this is a little strange that I
62:32 figured out what this was and I'd never
62:34 seen it lead our astray so why did you
62:35 get me origami paper and she said
62:37 because you love the movie Blade Runner
62:38 and you made a comment that you'd want
62:40 to you would love to learn how to do a
62:42 gaffe does which just fold all these
62:44 things up and so the explanation or the
62:48 scientific explanation might be that her
62:50 and I were in a very small twin bed and
62:52 so we were back-to-back as adults
62:54 because we hadn't bought our queen bed
62:55 yet so we just moved in together and
62:58 then maybe just having our heads close
63:00 together which was a lot of scientific
63:01 proof that this happens I simply read
63:03 her mind and I integrated the book as
63:05 the narrative of the mechanism so it's
63:11 sort of up there as a weird thing I
63:14 contacted her ten years after as I've
63:16 said before and I said well didn't you
63:18 think that was weird
63:18 she goes I just thought you read my mind
63:20 I was like okay probably did but back
63:24 then I thought maybe the reason why
63:26 because before I'd interpreted the idea
63:28 that I could have read her mind like
63:29 that it did not occur to me until much
63:30 later I thought well maybe it's because
63:33 I was reading this book and the book was
63:37 updating my frequency to aliens right do
63:41 these greys or whatever right
63:43 but according to Stevens group is just
63:45 one of many species that have come to
63:48 earth and he then said in his serious
63:55 movie I believe I got the name of that
63:56 right that that's what he does he takes
63:59 people out and they all think about
64:00 seeing aliens and then they start seeing
64:02 them and then they can film them it's
64:04 like they know where to point the camera
64:05 and he has all kinds of footage of
64:06 saying these lights come up and down
64:08 even whitley strieber says if you go
64:09 visit him in upstate New York he'll
64:11 definitely get you a visitation but it's
64:13 never what
64:14 Whitley experiences which is like full
64:18 abduction so what if it is a matter of
64:21 opening our minds because we have this
64:24 injected into our minds then the
64:27 regiment to open up the communications
64:29 is exactly what Steven gur is talking
64:31 about we have to lay to the side the
64:37 fictional narratives of Hollywood and we
64:39 have to sit and develop really basic
64:42 acknowledgement of their existence and
64:44 really nothing more nothing more just
64:48 understand that there's probably more
64:50 life out there wherever we are for those
64:53 of you who believe in Flat Earth think
64:54 of it as your dome owners and that
64:57 they're simply slipping in through some
64:58 door they show up they have their thing
65:00 any they're not perfect so an electrical
65:03 storm or some anomaly inside maybe
65:05 they're fighting over the controls or
65:07 the ham sandwich it's in there and it
65:08 blows up and it hits the ground whatever
65:11 reason they do crash every once in a
65:13 while and when the crash happened just
65:15 so lucked out it was in Roswell New
65:17 Mexico or just outside of Roswell New
65:19 Mexico and they managed to make contact
65:22 with Americans but according to other
65:26 foreign governments they've also made
65:27 contact as well as Steven Greer said in
65:31 his unacknowledged special on Netflix
65:36 which I recommend you see I don't
65:38 believe with everything and
65:39 unfortunately for him John Podesta I
65:42 believe closes the credits this mumbling
65:45 rambling session at the end well will he
65:48 regret that and six months or so but
65:52 maybe it is that we have to just simply
65:56 start thinking about the fact that we're
65:59 not all by ourselves and maybe we'll
66:02 start to see things we didn't see so I'm
66:05 curious about your research into UFOs
66:08 and whether or not you think that
66:11 there's a cycle because I seriously
66:13 seriously need your knowledge you're
66:18 more intimate knowledge in UFOs to know
66:21 whether or not you believe and just take
66:23 it decade to decade right and let me
66:27 know if you think
66:28 if we have surges in visual sightings
66:33 and I want you to keep in mind as if you
66:35 do think there is a cycle okay keep in
66:38 mind the Hollywood machine which is both
66:42 film and television you could throw
66:45 books in before that because that would
66:47 be a methodology and radio right you had
66:49 the the War of the Worlds by each by um
66:53 sorry Orson Welles and his group that
66:59 exacerbated panic and what's interesting
67:03 about the Orson Welles War the worlds is
67:06 that you have no visual confirmation of
67:09 what's going on and he but the panic is
67:12 I guess in New York City the public
67:15 started to panic because somehow they
67:17 had enough information and their mind to
67:20 see something that wasn't there and
67:21 panic I think that's fascinating and I
67:25 was going to mention before closing the
67:29 Ezequiel passages in the Bible where's
67:32 another place that people go you have
67:35 hieroglyphs in Egypt and I believe even
67:39 in Sumerian actually Sumerian stuff is
67:42 not really iconic but at least in the
67:44 Egyptian stuff that you have unexplained
67:47 symbols in sort of the sky versions of
67:50 various illustrations right you have as
67:54 I've said many episodes cultures that
67:56 believe that they are from space
67:57 Zulu supposedly means people from space
68:00 I've only heard that from David Icke and
68:02 his little shaman guy but you know
68:04 that's true that's interesting
68:06 you have the the Mayan illustrations
68:11 which look like guys inside spaceships
68:15 so I don't know when man would first
68:19 start to hypothesize that that there is
68:24 someplace to be in space saying the moon
68:27 is very interesting to think that it
68:29 looks like land in space maybe there's
68:32 someone on that land in space just like
68:34 there down the street you know if you
68:37 could look into the ocean and see an
68:38 island and then you find out there's
68:39 people there or that you can go there
68:40 and live there
68:41 then you might start to think okay we
68:45 can be wherever we can stand and we
68:47 don't know there's atmosphere and all
68:49 this other stuff for a long time ago so
68:50 we started envisioning that maybe when
68:54 you look into the blackness of night
68:55 with these little sparkling stars the
68:58 idea that man would turn that into some
69:00 sort of solar system with with planets
69:02 out there it seems almost inconceivable
69:04 that would be the next thought that man
69:06 would have without empirical information
69:08 that that was the case Graham Hancock
69:12 which studies the pyramids to a level
69:15 that nobody has ever studied the
69:16 pyramids you have this interesting due
69:21 north placement on the ground this
69:23 absolute precision in the actual Great
69:25 Pyramid and then you have if you take
69:27 the measurements of the pyramid you
69:30 start to with a divisible divisibility
69:34 by 72 you start to get the circumference
69:36 of the earth the I think it's the
69:40 diameter of the earth and they're
69:43 symbols for month and year look to be
69:46 orbital patterns around the Sun and a
69:47 moon and so it does seem that the
69:52 Egyptians had full knowledge of space
69:55 and full knowledge of a life out there
69:58 so I don't know maybe we had it all at
70:02 one point and now we don't have it
70:03 anymore why the Egyptians wouldn't
70:05 render the actual alien beings well
70:07 maybe those those gods of theirs were
70:10 those folks I think you feel me I wanted
70:13 to kind of Pierce this because it's been
70:15 on my mind I've seen a lot of alien
70:17 stuff recently getting a cycle I think
70:18 is returning because prosperity is
70:20 returning and that's where we kind of
70:21 get to relax and see more you know if
70:24 you dig the show please go to deep
70:26 thoughts video calm audio and video
