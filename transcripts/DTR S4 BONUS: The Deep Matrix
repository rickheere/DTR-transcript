00:31 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:34 welcome to another bonus video of deep
00:40 thoughts so it's it's almost summer here
00:45 at night time it's pretty good during
00:48 the day so you don't me I like to think
00:51 about really interesting exercises for
00:55 the brain I also like right in film and
00:59 so sometimes you know you know when you
01:02 do it's almost like the old
01:06 brainstorming sessions you might have in
01:08 business sometimes you need to do that
01:12 in story you must throw darts in your
01:15 mind and just piece of stuff together
01:18 that's never been pieced together before
01:20 and see what comes about they're kind of
01:23 came of this idea I'm calling it in my
01:26 mind the deep matrix and it has to do
01:30 with the idea that this is a matrix a
01:34 simulation and then I started think
01:38 about well what is the what is the
01:41 anatomy of a of a matrix why why do we
01:45 say that why does it make it different
01:47 and the theory I think that most of us
01:50 conceive of especially due to the movie
01:53 but we would have probably conceived of
01:55 it way before the film came out which is
01:57 why the film logically created itself
01:59 the way it did is that in the physical
02:02 world that we live in now the ether
02:04 abase world that we believe we live in
02:08 we seem to have a tremendous amount of
02:12 things that we can do we know that the
02:16 variable list is Gigantor you know I
02:20 don't even know what kind of number I
02:23 would use to try to itemize everything
02:25 then our reality that could go one way
02:28 or the other and thus change everything
02:32 that butterfly and Peru changing the
02:34 price of tea in China the butterfly
02:38 effect
02:40 but in this world is all about causality
02:44 that's what physics tells us science
02:46 tells us equal and opposite reaction
02:49 reaction and opposite reaction you'll
02:56 hear the sprinklers at night if one
02:57 small my neighbor finally fixed your
02:59 sprinklers and when they come on the
03:01 possums they were hanging out in that
03:02 backyard op their ass on the fence it's
03:06 really funny but now the matrix is a
03:08 place where we I think conceived quite
03:11 comfortably that anything can be done
03:16 anything can be done and that's what
03:20 appeals to us about it
03:22 it's like matrix the movie mr. Smith
03:25 pushes through any being it's like was
03:31 it Morpheus
03:32 so Morbius Morpheus Laurence Fishburne's
03:37 character he snaps his finger in the
03:40 matrix and boom it's a white room and
03:41 all that stuff happens you can jump
03:45 across the building bend a spoon bend
03:50 reality around the spoon hmm I don't
03:55 think that were the same kind of human
04:00 beings that we were 30 years ago in that
04:06 and that's not a profound statement
04:10 think about how rapidly we shrunk the
04:13 world how rapidly we evaporated and
04:18 vaporized frontiers with the internet
04:25 used to be when I was a kid you wanted
04:27 to travel the world because you hadn't
04:29 actually seen anything and you were
04:34 still naive to the the frequencies of
04:36 Instagram which is my life's better than
04:38 yours
04:39 that was pretty subliminal to most
04:41 people and now it is right in our face
04:45 we know those algorithms because we see
04:49 it all the time and what was somehow
04:51 this keeping up with the
04:53 the neighbors is now sort of a an Aussie
05:00 esteeming we don't want to be those
05:04 people anymore
05:06 one we probably feel it ourselves
05:10 someone is living a pretty amazing
05:12 moment and whether or not they're
05:13 getting everything out of it you would
05:14 is to be determined at a future time if
05:19 you see a photo and you're like I wanna
05:20 kind of wish I lived a life right now
05:22 someone's in Hawaii either or they're in
05:25 the Bahamas or wherever you want to be
05:26 they're there and you can't be there
05:29 because you can't afford it
05:30 maybe you can afford it but someone in
05:32 your family sick and you can't leave
05:35 mm-hmm but the thing too is that the
05:38 mysteries of the world are starting to
05:40 evaporate almost entirely I have seen
05:44 personally pictures of every place I'd
05:49 ever want to be so many times by so many
05:51 people it's kind of lost its thing now
05:56 there's still some places I want to see
05:58 the Pyramids of Giza at some point of my
06:00 own eyes but I'm taking you through this
06:03 little exercise so that we can get to
06:06 the pretense of what I'm gonna call for
06:10 the preface I should say of the deep
06:12 matrix now I've mentioned in a couple
06:17 episodes this notion that we want to
06:21 have the freedom that is in the matrix
06:24 the movie there are no limitations if it
06:27 can be conceived excuse me then we'll
06:32 have it now to the same degree that the
06:36 internet has shrunk reality for us and
06:39 tempered our frontiers seeking
06:44 adventurous minds because everything has
06:47 been seeing everything's been done so -
06:51 it would be the matrix you turn it on
06:57 let's just say for the first time you
07:01 jack into it you're in some VR
07:05 messing around in it you are neo but
07:08 there are no mr. Smith's chasing you yet
07:11 and you play in it you're like oh my god
07:14 I can do anything in here dial up a
07:17 human being they're your boyfriend your
07:20 girlfriend you dial up a rock band you
07:23 could be the lead singer the guitar
07:24 player the drummer doesn't matter you're
07:25 gonna play the drums are saying but in
07:27 this matrix you open your mouth and the
07:31 perfect note comes out you just kind of
07:33 strum around the guitar and the right
07:34 thing happens whatever you want to be
07:37 touch your fingertips how fast would
07:41 your world shrink how fast would it
07:45 shrink I think it would shrink so
07:48 utterly instantaneous going from all
07:53 things that are possible that that are
07:55 within your conception circle to being
08:00 completely bored out of your mind within
08:02 15 minutes just like when you turn a
08:04 first-person shooter on and you set it
08:06 to God mode and you can't get hurt and
08:08 you know one bullet kills and you just
08:12 talk to somebody and they die provided
08:16 that that's what you're supposed to do
08:17 get rid of all the bad guys eventually
08:21 it's boring and not only is it boring
08:26 that experience has often resulted as
08:29 I've said in game testing but even in my
08:33 own personal travels you never want to
08:36 play the game again and I mean you never
08:38 want to play it ever again
08:40 something happens because you've tasted
08:45 full and infinity of what could possibly
08:49 happen and what frontier is left for the
08:52 mind what elephant graveyard is there to
09:00 explore beyond nothing now I want you to
09:04 bear with me here because we're talking
09:06 about a matrix world in this episode so
09:10 whatever I'm talking about if I mention
09:13 the real world I'm going to designate it
09:14 if I'm not sucking if I don't preface it
09:17 that way then we
09:18 talking about a matrix world think about
09:21 where we think we are right now I mean
09:25 the matter what shape you think the
09:27 world is we are in a deep black nothing
09:37 on a shape and we're here and if any of
09:45 the instrumentalities that we have been
09:46 able to figure out any of the machines
09:48 that we use to measure perhaps distance
09:51 to other stars other planets potentially
09:56 these galaxies shots are real we would
10:00 be in this place that is so isolated and
10:05 so far away from perhaps the edge of the
10:07 machine or perhaps were an entity that
10:13 doesn't really exist the way we think we
10:17 exist that we are essentially characters
10:22 in print in a book trying to escape the
10:26 pages and the author who wrote us maybe
10:32 he finds that funny maybe he just as a
10:36 scientist goes well that's that's a
10:38 noble effort but you're trying to do
10:40 there but because of paradigm problems
10:45 because of the very nature of your
10:47 existence versus where I exist for it's
10:50 just where you exist your ink on a page
10:52 you don't exist until someone reads
10:55 linearly phonetic words and it manifests
10:59 this temporary consciousness of your
11:02 existence could you imagine if we were
11:05 just the thought in someone's mind when
11:07 they read a book and then as soon as
11:10 they forget us we disappear I think that
11:15 I have seen no evidence that we are in a
11:20 matrix necessarily but how would we
11:25 define it right if I'm defining it as a
11:28 limitless paradigm then
11:31 this isn't that program is it we
11:35 definitely have limitations those
11:37 limitations define us how tall are you
11:41 how smart are you but close your hair
11:44 what your voice sound like when you
11:46 speak how do you laugh what food do you
11:50 like where do you live how many of you
11:54 exist at one time that you're aware of
11:57 one two more hmm I think there's only
12:04 one of me right now with this
12:07 consciousness now I believe that quite
12:11 frankly maybe a bunch of us out there
12:15 maybe there's like one of us like I've
12:17 said before I think when the most
12:20 terrifying aspects that that I think
12:23 about when I think about things like hey
12:27 God an infinite omnipotent all-knowing
12:31 always has been there always will be God
12:35 is the notion of existing with no
12:42 knowledge quite frankly of what it's
12:44 like to die now some people in religion
12:48 believe that God came down as a man set
12:52 aside the universe and all of his
12:53 responsibilities and came down as a man
12:56 and then lived about thirty plus years
13:00 and died and struggled with all kinds of
13:08 you know thoughts like a normal man
13:10 would don't know doesn't sound plausible
13:15 to me the reasoning behind it sounds
13:18 fairly interesting but how could a God
13:21 set aside his responsibilities to hold
13:25 the universe together to keep the
13:27 mathematics of the universe running like
13:30 a program that never ever shuts down has
13:34 no bugs and just runs and then the
13:40 question comes about the chicken and the
13:43 egg question
13:44 what was before God regardless of what
13:50 you believe our reality is we will
13:53 always have quite frankly maybe in an
13:58 afterlife as well the nine question of
14:04 where did all this come from can you
14:08 imagine this fictional and I'm just
14:15 saying fiction because I'm making this
14:16 up I am making this up that's why I'm
14:17 saying fictional but we die and or you
14:22 die should make it personal and you
14:25 travel to the center of the universe
14:27 wherever that is metaphorically speaking
14:30 and you are beholding God and it feels
14:35 good it's a wonderful place no
14:37 complaints and you know you flex your
14:41 wings you relax a little bit but
14:42 eventually you go to a picnic with God
14:46 somewhere and you can ask God questions
14:51 and you say God is it okay if I ask you
14:56 where you came from I mean I know that
15:00 they say that you've been here the whole
15:02 time but strictly there was a moment
15:05 without you and what if God says I don't
15:08 know I've wondered that myself because
15:13 as far as I know I was always here there
15:17 was never anything before me now let me
15:22 give you a couple observations on that
15:25 if we talk about the characters in a
15:28 book where the very first line in the
15:31 first page is perhaps the first person
15:35 thought of our main character our
15:37 protagonist but you could somehow sneak
15:41 into the book and say what was what was
15:44 there before the first page the
15:48 character might just simply say in all
15:49 honesty well I don't know I in terms of
15:54 this reality which is the first page to
15:56 the last page
15:57 since I exist on the last page cuz I'm
16:00 telling you the story
16:02 I've always existed unless there's a
16:06 negative page set that goes under you
16:08 know the number one page
16:12 you know Roman numerals or whatever
16:14 I've always existed I don't know
16:17 anything else but here we are man we're
16:21 man on earth and I just gave the analogy
16:22 of the book I know you got it guy gives
16:27 you some form of that answer himself I
16:29 don't know not existing I just know
16:34 existing and I seem to keep going time
16:38 is only an illusion that you incur
16:41 because you have memory like me and we
16:45 have state change in the universe
16:47 things change it's an ecosystem things
16:52 are birthed things are renewed it goes
16:55 in a big cycle it seems to go forever
16:58 but God's just in this infinite cycle of
17:01 being alive and then we're still left
17:05 while being in heaven let's just say
17:09 we're still dealing with the anxiety of
17:14 the Enigma of our creation and the only
17:19 way to get over it
17:21 save being able to jump out of the book
17:24 and look around the office of the writer
17:26 is to simply divorce ourselves from the
17:30 question in the first place
17:32 that the question is the Enigma not the
17:35 universe now some people might find
17:38 solace and abstracting this reality into
17:43 a matrix to essentially create the
17:46 turtle explanation of where the world is
17:50 the world is flat and it's on the back
17:53 of a turtle the old question well what
17:56 is that turtle standing on and the old
17:58 lady says it's Turtles all the way down
18:01 hmm well if we say we're not really here
18:06 in this real world we're in a matrix
18:08 we're in a computer and there's all this
18:10 proof
18:11 that it's a computer okay
18:14 well whereas the computer exists who
18:18 made the computer who wrote the program
18:20 and where did they come from you find
18:23 yourself right back inside the paradox
18:28 there's no solution for this question
18:31 the only solution would be to say it's a
18:34 dumb question in the first place
18:35 we simply exist because man is born
18:40 lives a little while and dice and can
18:42 die so many different ways it's
18:44 ridiculous when you pop out of the human
18:47 body and you go into the soul realm the
18:51 energy realm of our true existence are
18:53 pure Rome no there's no real way to die
18:57 and so perhaps the way to deal with that
19:03 paradox that is right in front of your
19:05 face once you pop out if you can
19:07 maintain that question in your mind and
19:09 you care then you've got to be born into
19:13 a some sort of body to forget it for a
19:16 little while and maybe hope and pray
19:19 that you stay ignorant in this life and
19:21 never ask the question in the first
19:23 place but what do we hope to gain by the
19:26 answer in the first place
19:27 what kind of answer could be given to
19:29 that question oh there was nothing and
19:36 then there was something even to say
19:39 consciousness is the one we really want
19:42 to know about what is the first
19:43 conscious life birthed into this world
19:48 into the universe itself god oh they say
19:53 well it was the an amalgamation of
19:57 forces and materials ether oh particles
20:00 provided some sort of tangible body and
20:02 then there's this spiritual force which
20:04 is really love and when the two worked
20:08 together they ended up creating
20:09 consciousness in a physical form in a
20:13 non-physical form or whatever and then
20:15 somebody says but where did all this
20:18 stuff come from
20:20 regardless if it exists regardless of
20:22 how inert it might be or
20:26 extremely meaningful where did it come
20:30 from
20:31 for me the concept of the deep matrix
20:34 goes like this how many layers of a
20:39 matrix are there how many layers
20:43 I mean we're I mean we're in one version
20:48 for sure but is there one above us and
20:51 then above that and above that the idea
20:55 being we really have a pretty simple
20:58 requirement for the afterlife don't we
21:00 you know atheists want to disappear into
21:03 nothing fine
21:04 poof you get what you asked for that the
21:07 the spiritual people they have all kinds
21:10 of different types of gods you know some
21:12 people want a bunch of virgins because
21:14 they're gonna rape a bunch of girls
21:15 that's awesome right unreal
21:19 but most people want to go to some
21:21 pearly gates and have this weird dude
21:23 read a book and then you go to a bad
21:24 place or a good place and there's some
21:26 folks like us that are just say look I
21:28 just want to meet the Creator have a few
21:32 words chill out relax in the green room
21:34 a little bit get to get my new lines for
21:37 the next script I'm gonna be in and then
21:41 come back down and roll hard like Putin
21:45 so if you think about it our
21:47 requirements for the afterlife are
21:50 pretty modest pretty damn modest I have
21:55 not heard someone sufficiently described
21:59 Heaven who believes in heaven the way
22:01 that they were taught in church in fact
22:06 one of the most religious people I ever
22:07 dated iced I finally stopped her once
22:09 and I said well well what is heaven tell
22:13 me you were so sure you disliked me
22:15 because we can't agree on a religious
22:17 doctrine even though you go to your
22:18 church and you couldn't possibly get
22:20 with anyone there in in its full form
22:23 and the woman had never read the Bible
22:24 on her life cover to cover but so sure
22:27 that she needed to find a way to be
22:29 superior to me it was really strange but
22:33 she started to try and explain it and I
22:36 think within about and I am not
22:38 exaggerating
22:39 within 20 to 30 seconds if not 10 to 15
22:42 she said it's just heaven this is heaven
22:46 and the weird thing was I got the sense
22:49 I could be wrong but I got the sense
22:51 that she was willing to suffer in this
22:52 world and not chase any dreams and punch
22:55 out of a lot of issues that she had
22:58 because she's literally living to die to
23:02 go to heaven when maybe one of the
23:05 things God wants us to do is become
23:07 something God is expending potentially
23:10 let's make let's make God very man-made
23:13 for one second as the helicopter
23:15 approaches the show here well let's say
23:18 God is keeping you alive
23:20 and it's effort it's obviously an
23:24 infinitely small piece of his his
23:27 control apparatus I say he just for the
23:29 sake of argument but then you get to
23:33 heaven you get to meet him and he's like
23:34 well I made you alive but what did you
23:37 do you waited to be back up here again
23:39 like you dialed out what was the point
23:41 of that I mean I'm not a jerks I didn't
23:45 just yank you out of the world I didn't
23:46 just go poof you don't exist anymore I
23:48 waited and waited and waited for you to
23:51 do something interesting with yourself
23:52 and you never did and now you want to
23:55 come up here and chill with me forever
23:56 because it's just heaven and I got to
23:59 entertain you here well what makes here
24:03 any better than there you sat around and
24:05 waited for something to be brought to
24:08 you I guess you weren't participating in
24:10 your own life you didn't think out of
24:13 the box one day when you were there
24:16 that's what I designed you to do and you
24:19 didn't do it hmm we don't have much of a
24:24 definition of a heaven anywhere in any
24:26 religion anywhere it's just this place
24:28 it's a lot better than this it's a place
24:30 where you don't have any aches and pains
24:32 because you don't have a body you know
24:35 all of our the funny thing is the common
24:37 definition is all of our lusts that we
24:39 develop in the human body in this
24:42 reality whatever this is we want to go
24:45 there and have infinite spoils of it I
24:50 mean could you imagine you know
24:52 the idea is like I want to eat a bunch
24:54 of you know sweet food and and never
24:56 gain weight and you know some people
24:57 like we can't really conceive of being
24:59 in heaven without our bodies so we
25:01 always sort of come up with some stories
25:03 about that I mean imagine somebody
25:07 watching you know some pretty mature
25:10 stuff on the internet every night and
25:12 then going to heaven it's like okay when
25:14 you were human
25:15 you were indulging and a bunch of
25:17 fantasies about things that don't
25:19 there's no materials up here to do what
25:22 you did and so the thing that you love
25:25 the most when you were down there
25:27 doesn't even exist appear by man's
25:30 primitive definition of a heaven I think
25:33 it's safe to say that if there is a
25:34 heaven of any kind some central place to
25:36 be your lust for the world are going to
25:40 change drastically but then what if you
25:42 got bored in the traditional definition
25:46 because you're just going to another
25:48 matrix another flavor of reality what if
25:53 there's one over that that you can't
25:54 even conceive of because you have to
25:57 live in that one that's above the one
25:59 that we're in to loosen up your your
26:02 paradigm of being human
26:06 I mean imagine you turn into this with
26:09 the people who take the dream molecule
26:15 you know the DMT people they say they
26:18 see spirits floating in the universe and
26:21 they're just colors everything's great
26:23 and they always seem to kind of come in
26:25 groups except there is some weird alien
26:28 that that seems to greet people on the
26:31 other side people believe in angels and
26:36 they believe in demons a different type
26:40 of life force that is either going to
26:42 perpetually do good things or those who
26:49 are responsible for bringing us the
26:50 negative such that perhaps we can
26:52 appreciate the positive and that's a
26:55 wild thing to ingest so we've said on a
26:58 couple shows you have to have bad to
27:02 recognize good so if you go to heaven
27:05 and you're in
27:06 hundred-percent good stage very good
27:08 good good
27:09 well eventually I'd probably wear off
27:11 and then you'll have no orientation for
27:13 bad or good and that's for what for
27:16 whatever reason you're gonna remember
27:18 the bad from your previous dimension of
27:20 existence now scientists will talk about
27:23 dimensions a lot and I've criticized
27:25 this a little bit but you know what they
27:31 are doing is coming up with a new
27:33 mathematical explanation of where you
27:35 could exist and the model of the
27:38 universe the most basic four dimensions
27:42 that we understand is X Y Z the cart
27:46 that three-dimensional coordinate system
27:47 in space and then T on top of that which
27:51 is what time are you in that reality and
27:55 then you can keep going and going and
27:57 going you then create instances of the X
28:00 Y Z T and so you're in a different one
28:02 and then that's form for the for the
28:04 sake of frequency in the quantum model
28:07 of everything well there's an infinite
28:09 one stack topic it's because number
28:11 systems go infinitely small and
28:12 infinitely big you know you shouldn't be
28:15 able to touch your fingers together and
28:17 you know eventually because you could
28:18 always zoom in and push it together
28:19 zoom in you know that paradox so at some
28:23 point when you start to existentially
28:25 really look at the matrix especially
28:28 what I would call the deep matrix and
28:32 probably one of the best ways to
28:34 visualize a deep matrix is to look at
28:36 these these mathematical models that
28:38 they come up with for a thirty dimension
28:42 reality or even higher as time goes on
28:44 they find more and more dimensions right
28:46 and with T it just becomes more insane
28:51 you know it's but I think that most of
28:54 us are concerned about the physical
28:55 before we're worried about the time
28:59 relevant coordinate of where we are
29:02 right you know I don't want to you know
29:05 I don't want to live in a body in a
29:09 universe where I am constantly birthed
29:12 into the universe and all I do is catch
29:14 on fire and I vaporized and I feel that
29:17 pain and then I come back and I come
29:19 back and I'm just Lu
29:20 in some fire-and-brimstone reality maybe
29:23 it's not even a penal system it's not
29:25 related to being a bad person or a bad
29:28 soul it's just a place that exists why
29:32 does it exist because it can't exist and
29:34 if it can't exist it will exist because
29:37 all things that can't exist do exist boy
29:40 say that 50 times fast the coolest thing
29:44 about our reality in my opinion when you
29:47 start to get to that level of almost a
29:50 frustration dream where you can conceive
29:53 of these variables that I'm talking
29:55 about and you can quickly just like when
29:57 you have anxiety trying to conceive of
29:59 an infinite number system you start to
30:03 conceive of these realities and and
30:04 immediately you know exponentially
30:07 explodes in your mind you know I don't
30:10 have enough synapses in my brain to hold
30:14 all those realities and a physical model
30:19 in my mind but here's what's interesting
30:22 well there's two things I would say but
30:23 one of the interesting and clever pieces
30:26 of evidence of our reality in my opinion
30:31 is something called design now I've said
30:37 it on probably a dozen shows and it's
30:39 something I think that you you and I
30:41 both need to remember this and say it to
30:43 ourselves life is beautiful
30:49 meaning quite literally all things on
30:52 this planet there are live are beautiful
30:57 now some folks might look at rocks and
30:59 we think they're beautiful especially
31:02 precious stones and that sort of thing
31:04 but let's pull back and look at a leaf
31:08 on any plant anywhere in the world look
31:12 at the amazing fractal digression in its
31:18 algorithm as a leaf veins spread out to
31:21 the edge of the leaf they start to
31:23 vanish the Fibonacci pattern in a lot of
31:27 its construction there is beauty in life
31:31 every fish every bird
31:33 every animal it has it's beautiful
31:37 amazing nature to it even these fish
31:40 that are the ones you're not supposed to
31:41 step on look like they're kind of made
31:43 of mud or whatever if you pull it out of
31:45 the water and look at it it is instead
31:50 of thinking of it having to be some sort
31:52 of smooth Ferrari or something like that
31:55 like these crazy beautiful
31:58 you know dragonflies and mantas all
32:03 these wild species of band tests that
32:04 are out there that fish that is known as
32:09 like the ugliest fish or whatever
32:10 because there you have youto if you take
32:12 them and try to make them
32:13 anthropomorphize them into human form we
32:16 would not date a chick that looks like
32:18 half the fish out there but if you just
32:19 stop and go wow someone was was
32:23 tinkering with every single
32:26 configuration that can survive as life
32:29 you can't make probably a fish without a
32:32 heart
32:33 or human without a heart so that's why
32:35 we always have hearts of some form and
32:37 fashion we have something pumping you
32:40 know an ecosystem to our system the
32:42 ether through our bodies so that we can
32:44 renew a rock is not considered alive
32:47 because it is pretty much a stationary
32:49 object all it erodes and he probably
32:52 goes to various phases over time
32:54 oxidizing or what-have-you but
32:56 everything that's alive is beautiful how
33:00 many times have you seen a landscape of
33:02 Earth so the you know consider the rock
33:04 a lie but you look at Earth from a high
33:06 altitude photograph and you're just wow
33:08 look at the Swiss Alps look at the
33:12 forests of Germany look at Hawaii all
33:17 these different locations a beautiful
33:19 desert the desert with like you know
33:22 huge sand dunes and the one that just
33:26 has crackled soil down belief you know
33:28 you've done beneath you know when you
33:30 see the crackled soil and those movies
33:33 are Tom Petty videos isn't it kind of
33:38 cool isn't it tactile let's just want to
33:41 touch it
33:41 haven't you been there as a kid when
33:43 some some mud dried up and all you want
33:46 to do is reach down and
33:47 kind of peel the top layer off and hold
33:50 it in your hand it's just wild design
33:54 shows for me intent every insect is just
33:59 fascinating if you really get into it if
34:03 we don't like in a particular insect or
34:05 animal like we look at it and we feel a
34:07 weird feeling it's probably due to you
34:11 know remnants of instinctual programming
34:13 this says that's dangerous right I'm
34:15 probably never going to easily look at a
34:17 1 foot diameter spider from the
34:22 rainforest and think oh wow
34:24 she liked to have that on my face you
34:26 know it's not gonna happen
34:28 so we have these indicators but aside
34:31 from that if you're in a safe laboratory
34:34 and these things aren't around you just
34:36 look at the photographs and you think
34:37 through it's phenomenal it looks like
34:41 intent to me when I get to this
34:44 conversation
34:45 I always reference my old episode I
34:47 think it's in season 1 called the answer
34:50 and it's right next to another episode
34:53 called the origin of man and the answer
34:57 really suggests and it's in its
35:01 conclusion that we just need to live the
35:04 life that we're living so maybe that's
35:08 the answer you know sometimes I will
35:12 contemplate especially for writing
35:15 purposes this notion of losing yourself
35:19 and avoid a real physical void imagine
35:24 getting in a spaceship and you know like
35:27 some of these little grey aliens that
35:28 are so ballsy to fly around the universe
35:30 and if they exist and you hop in a ship
35:37 and you fly so fast in a particular
35:40 direction you're way over warp 1 you
35:44 know and you're watching the Stars fly
35:48 by you know you see that stuff in Star
35:51 Trek all the time and the work factor
35:53 they'd have to be going to make stars go
35:55 flicking by them is hilarious right
36:00 let's say you're at warp a million and
36:04 gaining speed and everything's going by
36:06 and eventually if the fabric of the
36:11 universe still exists beyond a barrier
36:13 because it could just be out there and
36:17 then there's nothing else and you just
36:19 go woof right out there and you cease to
36:24 exist
36:25 your ship ceased to exist it just sort
36:27 of splatters on the wall basically but
36:31 imagine you didn't and now you're in
36:34 this void and there's nothing what are
36:40 the first emotions you might have as you
36:41 turn around look out the back window you
36:44 know in your little front display of
36:47 your stars Star Trek spaceship or maybe
36:51 even a little pod even more terrifying
36:53 is to see you in some weird coffin thing
36:56 so you're totally isolated and you see
36:59 the whole universe vanish and there's
37:05 nothing around nothing the amount of
37:09 horrific isolation I think that you
37:11 would feel on a split second if you
37:13 didn't think if you had no control over
37:15 your ship
37:16 you couldn't just turn it around in Hell
37:18 of even if you could that universe that
37:21 you were in is so teeny tiny now your
37:24 ability to find it if even if you could
37:26 turn around you would need some guidance
37:28 system and avoid to get you back you
37:30 need a breadcrumb of some sort to get
37:32 back to your home planet to kiss your
37:35 loved ones once again and the second you
37:39 drop it to that void
37:41 oh man the very essence of your purpose
37:47 surfaces ferociously you're supposed to
37:52 be with people you're not supposed to be
37:54 alone not supposed to be an avoid all
37:58 that you love in the world is gone
38:00 forever forever and what if you couldn't
38:05 die what if your ship just kept you
38:08 alive and there's no way you can turn
38:09 off the program and now you just
38:13 and you stare and you sit and you stare
38:18 and it's nothing forever you would try
38:24 to work within your pod to create
38:29 another dimension of reality to survive
38:32 the insanity of being in this thing and
38:35 you would probably go through millennia
38:38 of being totally insane inside this pod
38:43 can you imagine so one point you'd
38:50 probably stop using your eyeballs to see
38:53 what's the point seeing the inside of
38:57 the ship a million different ways
38:59 smaller it is the faster this is going
39:01 to occur I mean if you had a big Star
39:04 Trek spaceship even if you're by
39:06 yourself leaves you could mess around
39:07 and the ala deck or ten-forward or
39:09 whatever sleeping every single bed in
39:11 every single place eventually you would
39:14 still go nuts but sitting inside this
39:18 pod again if the ship can keep you alive
39:21 and for whatever reason you just can't
39:23 die you don't age at all you're going to
39:27 start doing what we do in this world
39:30 when we have deprivation situations you
39:36 will start to manifest your own reality
39:39 and your body you will most likely
39:43 evolve in that ship to the point where
39:46 especially we didn't die but you could
39:48 still kind of grow your brain would
39:51 start creating a reality you might start
39:54 talking to yourself for a while then you
39:57 wouldn't have to because in your mind
39:59 you might be living in a constant dream
40:03 state out of sheer necessity so maybe
40:10 your eyes are open maybe they're not you
40:12 don't see anything anymore like you used
40:14 to
40:15 you're seeing what's inside your mind's
40:17 eye and this is absurdly assuming that
40:20 you have the capability of doing this
40:22 and a void of all nothing right a true
40:25 vacuum I think as soon as you're a true
40:27 you don't exist anymore but let's just
40:29 keep it going but now when we dream we I
40:34 have a whole episode on dream people do
40:39 those beings exist I mean they're not
40:43 like normal human beings but boy some
40:45 dreams I have are so unbelievably
40:47 realistic that Jesus I have I have
40:51 recently had a dream in the last week
40:53 where I fell in love with a girl in my
40:57 dream it seemed like it lasted two or
41:00 three hours and the funny thing is is
41:03 there's nothing going on in the dream
41:05 that you would do in real life like I
41:07 never sit down with a girl in my dream
41:09 ago so where are you from just that
41:11 never happens I just know her she knows
41:15 me and a lot of times these women in
41:17 these dreams are introduced into my life
41:19 is walking in the room and it's love at
41:21 first sight and then we just sort of
41:23 spend time together we go do things
41:25 together we were up with other people
41:27 they're aware that we're an item and it
41:30 just happened within a split second but
41:33 if you really want to split hairs my
41:36 dream is definitely a dimensional world
41:38 I mean it's in color there's sound
41:42 there's people the world that I live in
41:45 now the architecture it's I don't really
41:49 ever dream of my own house or anything I
41:51 dream sort of a city life most the time
41:54 but it's real when I'm in the dream if
41:59 it weren't real then it wouldn't really
42:02 it wouldn't be a dream it would be
42:04 happening every times if you woke up
42:06 from really good dream and you can tell
42:08 your loved one about it in the most
42:10 explicit detail and you know as you are
42:14 waking up and losing your connection
42:15 with that dimension all the details that
42:19 you know that you knew start to just
42:22 fizzle away and even if you get a lot of
42:25 it written down on paper or out of your
42:27 mouth it is literally only being
42:32 remembered from that point forward
42:35 because you spoke it or wrote it
42:38 it's like you took it out of this
42:40 dimension of which you can't bring into
42:42 this world but you did through words and
42:46 you painted it into this reality I
42:49 remember being in my late teens and I
42:51 had a dream where I had grabbed
42:54 something and I was in the dream and I
42:58 remember feeling like I had to wake up
43:02 like someone was calling me in the real
43:04 world and I was like I gotta go I gotta
43:05 go
43:06 and I'm telling these dream people and I
43:10 remember grabbing something in the room
43:12 it was in my right hand and I was lying
43:13 down of course and I remember waking up
43:15 and feeling like this damn thing was in
43:17 my hand and I I was like oh my god I
43:20 pulled something from my dream into the
43:21 real world and for probably one or two
43:27 seconds of my sleep paralysis where I am
43:29 paralyzed you know because we all have
43:31 that I could feel it in my hand and then
43:36 poof the paralysis goes away I'm now
43:39 fully conscious or getting there very
43:41 quickly and I remember squeezing my hand
43:44 it wasn't there and I just my heart
43:46 broke I was like oh my god I almost got
43:49 it I almost pulled something from my
43:51 dream reality into this reality you know
43:54 there's the old Russian doll thingy a
43:58 person inside a person inside a person
44:02 and what's interesting about that whole
44:04 thing is a dream is sort of like a
44:07 Russian doll isn't it it's only too too
44:11 deep I mean like you have your outside
44:14 body that's dreaming it's the outer
44:15 shell and if you pull that half off the
44:18 one inside that looks just like you is
44:20 inside the dream Russian doll is sort of
44:25 like a dimensional metaphor you know
44:31 Freud talked about us having deeper and
44:32 deeper levels of consciousness yeah you
44:35 know whether we truly have a
44:37 subconscious I don't know it seems as if
44:41 we simply have a processor that
44:43 continues to process things that aren't
44:47 in our short-term memory
44:51 it's back there thinking about why
44:53 humans like tea boiled leaves in water
44:57 my hope is that perhaps contemplating
45:03 these things that are so abstract but
45:06 yet real such as reality right real
45:12 reality is that we can somehow come up
45:17 with a way of living that gives us peace
45:22 but still be inquisitive it's almost as
45:26 if well again part of it has to do with
45:28 the finale of altered states the movie
45:31 trying to find the inception point of
45:34 life and here's a spoiler alert at 50
45:39 some odd minutes because during the
45:42 sci-fi forgotten sci-fi movies I didn't
45:45 spoil it for you but here we gotta bring
45:47 it out and I've brought it out in
45:48 previous episodes as well but he found
45:51 that void he found that nothingness at
45:54 the beginning of time and he said it was
45:58 terrifying
45:59 it was terrifying in that it was nothing
46:02 and that fictional character in that
46:06 movie if he had existed and gone through
46:08 that phase you were talking about a
46:11 person that would never ask the
46:14 existential question ever again because
46:16 he for one got the answer how many
46:21 people have had a near-death experience
46:22 not a life after death experience but a
46:25 near-death experience and they they
46:29 realized how much of their life they
46:31 weren't living and they completely
46:32 changed their daily appreciation for
46:36 everything their daily life and then you
46:39 see it and you're like god I don't want
46:41 to have a near-death experience ever but
46:45 boy I certainly would I certainly would
46:47 like to get that mojo that that dude or
46:50 that chick has having gone through then
46:52 I would be interested in your your
46:58 objectives and if your a matrix person
47:02 what if any solace you find in that
47:06 theory do you feel more comfortable
47:09 being electrons in some memory grid
47:13 somewhere and some higher up computer do
47:17 you want to be a program in Tron does
47:20 that solve any problems for you I'm not
47:23 saying it does I'm just curious if you
47:24 feel more comfortable with that but then
47:27 where is the computer who programmed it
47:29 and who made them and who made them and
47:31 who made them right it's a hell of a
47:35 thing to wake up to this dimensional
47:37 reality question isn't it because I
47:39 didn't always think this way
47:40 I was so content as a child to think I'm
47:44 down here on earth God's up there don't
47:47 know about this Jesus character but I
47:49 don't need that to feel complete in my
47:51 model of the universe I need to be good
47:54 and virtuous down here and need to tell
47:56 the truth don't step on anyone to get
48:00 ahead sort of thing want to travel
48:03 through the eye of the needle with ease
48:06 that's it I die I go to heaven as a
48:10 child my vision of heaven was in fact I
48:14 used to I used to pray to God every once
48:16 in a while as a child and I would say
48:17 it's a gun because something will would
48:21 have happened or some vision of what I
48:23 wanted to do with life would befall me
48:27 and I would immediately say to get okay
48:28 God when I get up there I want you to
48:31 remember that I want to do this
48:33 Hey well half the time it would be when
48:36 you watching to remember one it was a
48:39 woman it was like a soda commercial or a
48:42 beer commercial was a woman on some like
48:46 little tiny sailboat and I think she was
48:50 like literally hanging on the mast it
48:52 was really tiny it was like maybe 10
48:53 feet wide it was I was like I when
48:55 surfing before they put it onto
48:57 surfboards or whatever was but she was
48:59 really beautiful and I remember I said
49:01 you know God I want to kiss that girl
49:03 want to you know be with her I don't
49:05 really have super sexual thoughts at the
49:07 time but I said I want to I want to be
49:09 with that girl bizarre that's a
49:13 primitive my definition was it was a
49:15 that heaven was a mimimi world no sense
49:19 of I was an only child too but so
49:21 there's no sense of communion in heaven
49:25 all my grandparents were alive all my
49:28 aunts and uncles were alive parents are
49:31 alive you know and so I never thought of
49:37 anything else until losing my
49:39 grandparents and then it was like wow or
49:42 I started finding out my heroes are gone
49:44 you know I discovered what Rod Serling
49:47 passed away I believe in it was 1975 he
49:52 was 50 years old and you know when I I
49:56 didn't know who he was when I was a
49:58 child and it's really strange I've
50:02 always had this weird thing with it's
50:06 sort of a weird comfort thing that sure
50:11 it was 75 70 years said if I think I'm
50:12 75 but that he was alive and I was alive
50:16 at the same time on planet Earth that
50:17 sort of warms my heart you know with
50:20 classical musicians they're all dead
50:22 you know before you're born she was
50:24 gonna go and Leonardo was not alive ever
50:26 during my lifetime but now it's so you
50:30 know it's sort of I think it's fairly
50:33 common to romanticize heaven to address
50:36 loss I want to see my grandmother again
50:40 maybe I want to be young again I want to
50:44 live the 70s and 80s again certain parts
50:47 of it parts of my childhood but maybe
50:51 you never do even if you go God says
50:56 well that was the past the only thing
50:58 you could do is go back down and become
51:00 a human being again but that's just it
51:03 just I'm as real and the time is a
51:04 limiter
51:06 but don't you want heaven to be a bit
51:09 like the matrix soon as they get there I
51:13 want to be able to I want to be able to
51:15 do stuff that I never could do or do it
51:17 again which is just in itself as a
51:20 magical trick you know I want to be nine
51:22 years old and drive my motorcycle again
51:24 or eight years old with my motorcycle I
51:27 want to roam
51:28 the country fields of my Kansas hometown
51:32 19 was at 78 for sure I'm gonna go see
51:40 Star Wars for the first time again maybe
51:43 I'll go to as an adult same theater
51:45 maybe even watch myself across the room
51:47 look at that [ __ ] man see it for the
51:49 first time see it a hundred times watch
51:51 it all over the world with different
51:52 audiences and see how they reacted to it
51:54 you know I want to direct every script
51:57 I've ever written I want to make it
51:59 organically with my own flaws and and
52:03 mistakes and then I want to make it so
52:05 many freaking times that it's perfect
52:08 you see how perfect I can get the story
52:10 anything we want the heaven to be a
52:13 matrix and the funny thing is is that we
52:16 always I mean I'm just speaking for
52:18 myself but I'm saying we because I think
52:22 I'm not alone in this situation but
52:23 imagine the situation where we feel like
52:28 we must be in physical body form to
52:31 exist and to enjoy those things from the
52:34 past one more time when we're in heaven
52:36 let's just say it exists but all that
52:40 really needs to happen is the organized
52:42 energy that is your soul perhaps if it
52:45 can manifest any visual aspects and the
52:48 DMT people seem to have proven that
52:50 gurus that flowed into the universe and
52:52 have out about experiences attached by a
52:55 silver cord they seem to have that proof
52:58 that there's some sort of physical
53:02 self-realization after death we want to
53:07 but you know we want to be physical but
53:09 maybe all that needs to happen is
53:11 however this stuff is controlled whether
53:14 it be God he's like I got your old
53:16 program he blows the dust off of it he's
53:20 like I said over there but you park your
53:22 soul over there you're like he's
53:24 floating energy and just sit on this
53:26 pedestal and God just reaches up his
53:30 metaphorical hands and puts himself
53:31 around you and he just injects in you
53:33 the vision like a brainstorm machine
53:36 Jex's vision in you where you feel that
53:39 you have your body
53:41 and you have this rich unbelievably real
53:44 experience that I mean every my new
53:47 detail from a rock in your shoe to
53:49 something in your ID how you feel after
53:51 you ate or whatever it's all tactile and
53:54 perfect and then he pulls his hands away
53:58 his metaphor glands and you sit there
54:02 and go but God that was so real
54:06 and then you might ask the question did
54:12 I ever really exist like that well were
54:15 you just putting your hands on me and
54:16 making me feel like I existed is there
54:19 even a planet Earth at all and God just
54:22 goes not really I mean it exists for you
54:27 didn't didn't that feel cool like yeah
54:30 totally I loved it
54:33 well then it's real now it's funny about
54:37 this matrix thing is that we have sort
54:42 of well we have a fictional version of
54:45 it in Star Trek called the holodeck it's
54:49 hard light right you go in there and
54:51 have this experiences now it's been all
54:54 these episodes where the safeguards go
54:56 haywire and people actually get hurt
54:58 people have even died in there I'm
55:01 pretty sure and so to them it's it's
55:04 real it's a machine that's creating it
55:06 and they can completely conceive of it
55:08 so it's real and then today in our
55:11 infantile state of computer programming
55:14 and simulation we have these horrible
55:19 headsets we put on and you know it's
55:21 very effective even if it's pretty low
55:24 res it's it takes over your brain even
55:26 though if you just focus for a split
55:27 second you can see the pixels that
55:29 you're staring at I haven't put the 4k
55:32 ones on I don't know anyone who has a 4k
55:36 headset but I know they make them it's
55:39 gonna have to be like 4 million cave
55:41 before your brain won't see pixels but
55:43 whatever we create those and we
55:46 experience them
55:47 and there's no problem conceiving how it
55:50 works
55:51 even the may even the holodeck we can
55:53 conceive of it but somehow this world
55:56 remains a giant mystery hmm we exist
56:00 here don't we
56:01 regardless of what it is we have this
56:05 thing you know that I can't seem to
56:07 shake the notion that the Mandela effect
56:10 in its larger more obtuse examples that
56:15 seem to be very evident that something
56:19 might be different I mean there's a lot
56:21 of people did you say look you're just
56:23 all remembering things wrong it could be
56:27 could be you know I've got my own list
56:29 of things that seem pretty opposite to
56:34 me but it seems like reality is pretty
56:38 organic right I have the episode on
56:42 consensus reality or that is the case we
56:46 are all homogenizing our impression of
56:50 reality and if there's any sort of
56:55 organic element to the program it would
56:59 suggest that the program isn't as
57:04 disciplined as we might think it wasn't
57:07 you know we were born and told what it
57:09 is right but if we have 8 billion people
57:12 in the world and a billion people
57:16 remember it one way and 500 million
57:18 remember it that way and etc xsr down
57:20 the line then you might have enough
57:24 consciousness power to make the
57:27 continent of the United States remember
57:29 Berenstein well there's a big chunk in
57:32 Europe that members Berenstain I mean
57:36 they remember saying it in school
57:39 librarians here in the United States
57:42 remember Berenstein and they were
57:45 handing out those books for 3540 years
57:47 to kids
57:49 don't you think somebody would be
57:52 looking down and going oh why is it it's
57:56 Berenstain not Berenstein look rare look
57:59 at that word oh yeah I got it wrong
58:01 no one did that in the United States of
58:03 America I forgot what the painting was
58:06 but there's the passage in the Bible
58:07 that talks about something about laying
58:10 down with the lamb or something like
58:12 that and all the paintings and that the
58:14 churches are now kept they have that
58:16 passage on the painting but it's a lion
58:18 instead of a lamb seems kind of weird
58:22 man passage about a lamb has a line
58:24 something something like that it's nuts
58:26 right
58:28 talk about a glitch in the system man
58:30 there's a part of me that still believes
58:32 in consensus reality and it's sort of a
58:34 bummer when you think about well I
58:37 should say this much when you wake up to
58:39 the corruption of the universe was
58:42 corruption of this planet you think in
58:45 man I don't want anyone to think about
58:46 this stuff but if the billions of
58:48 dollars that are put into public
58:50 perception truly do convince people to
58:53 believe a particular way and maybe
58:57 whatever they want you to believe starts
59:00 to become a reality but it takes
59:01 hundreds of years and you know it pounds
59:04 it into you the Inquisition's in Europe
59:06 that pounded Christianity into the
59:08 citizens who said we don't want to
59:11 believe this we were here the whole time
59:13 when you said this these miracles were
59:15 occurring we didn't see any miracles
59:16 that had happened we would have known
59:19 about it
59:19 it all would have flocked to to Rome to
59:23 be healed or whatever this never
59:25 happened
59:27 pound pound pound you know but now
59:30 there's no more inquisitions and now
59:33 through the internet especially critical
59:36 thinking is coming back with a vengeance
59:38 and now honestly without getting to on a
59:44 point we have people that seem to
59:48 believe a weird version of the world and
59:50 they're young and when you know either
59:56 because you lived the reality that
59:57 they're denying or you've got enough
60:00 empirical evidence to prove to yourself
60:02 that what was claimed to be true is no
60:04 longer true regardless of how emotional
60:07 people get about a particular story and
60:11 people still believe it
60:14 then you know if we figured out this out
60:17 in a college then we could do some
60:21 calculations probably as idiotic as that
60:25 might sound to figure out okay it's
60:28 gonna take about a millennia of contrary
60:32 belief in this consensus reality to
60:36 finally flush out those lies and get rid
60:39 of them the deep matrix the real take
60:43 away definition of the deep matrix would
60:45 be how deep does it go how many layers
60:50 are there
60:50 imade dimensions of any reality exists
60:56 it would almost seem that inherently all
60:59 realities are made of infinite
61:01 dimensions because if they I'll give it
61:05 to you in a real simple manner if at any
61:09 point in time the elements of your
61:11 reality can be measured in dimensions
61:14 measured by numbers quantified by
61:17 numbers then you live an infinite
61:22 dimension of reality
61:24 you can change realities you know I mean
61:28 I don't know is there an infinite number
61:30 of books that can be written you know
61:34 before the monkeys right Shakespeare
61:36 maybe not sure 26 letters in the
61:39 alphabet but because the book can go on
61:42 forever and ever and ever and ever I
61:44 don't know does it turn into
61:46 gobbledygook some you you encoded URL I
61:50 don't know don't know it seems like it
61:54 could summertime is a good time to let
61:57 your mind open and relax at least in the
62:00 northern hemisphere apologize to my
62:03 Australian listeners New Zealand
62:05 listeners and south hemisphere listeners
62:08 you're getting in the colder realm of
62:10 your world what I like about summer is
62:12 that we get out in the Sun and believing
62:16 in ether it would be naive to not
62:22 consider for a second that the more
62:24 you're exposed to sunlight that rich
62:27 deep
62:28 summer sunlight which for some reason
62:30 feels different than winter sunlight
62:32 doesn't it like if it's 95 degrees
62:36 whichever which happens every once in a
62:38 while in December in California and I go
62:40 outside in this backyard
62:41 and I'm sweating making a show it feels
62:45 different something weird about the
62:49 season being able to heat me up that
62:51 much but it seems that let's just say
62:54 this okay in this dimension of reality
62:58 which I believe is again heavily ether
63:01 based I'm sorry for mentioning that
63:03 several times do not drink alcohol every
63:05 time I say ether so I will turn you into
63:07 an alcoholic but imagine the amount of
63:11 information that you're getting from the
63:12 entire universe the moment that you get
63:16 hit by full-frontal winds of ether /
63:21 photons photonic waves and it's just
63:26 think about it way out in the universe
63:28 perhaps there's life out there who knows
63:32 what it is but it's intelligent could be
63:35 a some amoebic multi-celled amoeba
63:38 creature and some planet sitting in some
63:41 pool of water having a pretty cool
63:44 thought but it's got a pretty good Sun a
63:46 very powerful Sun so the Sun is jamming
63:50 its ether waves through that beam
63:52 capturing the information like a little
63:55 tcp/ip packet hijack it goes into the
63:59 bowel that Sun and then it runs out the
64:01 other side of the Sun and it travels way
64:02 across the universe maybe just hopscotch
64:06 is from one son to another son to
64:08 another son and then eventually you're
64:11 sitting in your pool
64:12 chilling out thinking and because you've
64:17 relaxed your mind all the chaos of the
64:21 universe disappears and here comes a
64:25 little packet information the epiphany
64:27 from a tiny little creature in another
64:30 planet goes straight into your head and
64:33 perhaps because that creature does not
64:36 exist in what you would perceive to be
64:39 reality
64:40 you're having this thought that no one
64:43 has ever had on planet earth before I
64:46 believe that all the plants in my
64:47 backyard are very much alive very much
64:51 alive
64:52 I think they have consciousness and they
64:55 think I don't know what they're thinking
64:57 about I would assume it's a pretty
65:00 peaceful thing because aside from a weed
65:06 whacker or someone trying to trim them
65:09 there's no predator for a plant it just
65:12 does what it does I have a gigantic tree
65:14 or I don't even know what it is it's all
65:16 these little tiny red berries but to you
65:19 I have two of them I don't know what
65:22 they're thinking that tree must be at
65:24 least 40 or 50 years old at least and
65:28 because every plant in the world in this
65:31 world that we live in is just a leaf or
65:35 a branch from its father or its mother
65:38 everyone to say its unisex predecessor
65:43 the palm tree I'm staring at I got two
65:45 or three an old bunch in the corner over
65:47 here that palm tree is the palm tree
65:50 they're all cousins they're all brothers
65:52 and sisters way back to the original
65:55 design slash mutation slash however got
65:59 here in the first place that's a lot of
66:02 thinking that is a lot of thinking all
66:06 these plants have seen all history of
66:08 all mankind since the very beginning
66:11 if there ever were dinosaurs they saw it
66:14 all it's in their bloodline Douglas
66:18 Adams came up with it the total
66:20 perspective vortex those of you don't
66:22 know who that is he wrote The
66:23 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy the
66:25 beautiful sci-fi comedy and one of the
66:28 jokes he put in his book which I've
66:30 mentioned a couple times and four
66:31 hundred some-odd episodes was one of the
66:35 punishments in the universe was to be
66:36 put in the total perspective vortex and
66:38 it was to give you the infinite
66:40 perspective of how sick insignificant
66:42 you are in the universe the infinitely
66:45 small dots on the infinitely small dot
66:48 infinitely small doesn't mean insignia
66:53 vacant just means small compared to all
66:57 the other mass in the universe and
66:59 energy and spirit perhaps man doesn't
67:05 like to feel insignificant I don't think
67:07 we are I think it's a moot argument to
67:11 contemplate but that passage had a huge
67:16 effect on me if I could heard it in the
67:18 radio broadcast first there's the old
67:21 video that called the power of 10 it
67:24 starts off with a woman I think lying
67:27 down actually starts at the the
67:30 subatomic level then it zooms all the
67:32 way out and it's it's every 10 seconds
67:34 it gets the power of 10 and keeps going
67:37 back so everything's magnified down 1/10
67:40 every 10 seconds and then you have to
67:42 accelerate to keep that algorithm going
67:45 I've never been able to shake that
67:47 tickles all the way out of the universe
67:49 and this you know pseudo definition for
67:51 the shape of the universe whatever then
67:52 it pushes all the way back and it goes
67:53 back into the girl's hand something very
67:56 therapeutic about that especially if you
67:59 want to come up with different models of
68:01 the universe if it's the same above as
68:05 it is below and this used to be a funny
68:09 joke that used to tell in the 70s when
68:11 people really start getting into weed
68:13 that you know the speck of dirt in your
68:17 fingernail could contain an entire
68:20 universe so no matter where you go it's
68:23 like a fractal way up above there's a
68:27 plant somewhere where maybe in the stem
68:28 of it you know and above that it just
68:31 keeps doing it keeps doing it's all a
68:32 big giant loop and then at that point
68:35 you don't need to contemplate anything
68:36 but the reality that you're in the
68:38 instance of reality that you're in the
68:41 only science fiction thing I'll say in
68:44 closing there about a matrix for me that
68:46 is the romantic version of this whole
68:49 argument would be we want to have time
68:54 bandit doors you know we want to somehow
68:56 walk out of this reality and have more
68:59 to do than just what is on the plate
69:01 today because there's a point where you
69:04 can conceive of everything you can do as
69:06 a human being
69:07 and then you start to contemplate you
69:09 know you pick out the ones you love and
69:11 then you dive in and you push hard and
69:16 then you run up against all the
69:17 obstacles that that particular endeavor
69:19 has and regardless of whether or not
69:23 you're ever going to get them done you
69:26 start to really just see life as a very
69:29 small short journey and you could change
69:33 realities but unless it's some dream
69:37 reality which is very euphoric almost
69:40 where what you care about in your dreams
69:45 is usually much different than what you
69:46 care about in reality this one anyway
69:49 when you wake up it seems like there's
69:53 less concern sometimes you know unless
69:54 you go to bed and have a frustration
69:56 dream or some nightmares some kind I had
69:59 an interesting story told to me within
70:02 the last month and it's about a person I
70:07 know who's dealing with a loved one who
70:09 is getting older and they're starting to
70:16 lose their physical ability in the world
70:18 because their bodies start to break down
70:19 they're still pretty healthy still going
70:22 well but one of the surprising
70:27 byproducts of this because I was talking
70:30 to him is like I was everything going
70:31 you know and he said well they're their
70:36 loved one is starting to have nightmares
70:40 at night and I said I said really
70:44 nightmares it's really were in this
70:46 person but I know of who's having these
70:48 nightmares it's not the kind of person I
70:51 would imagine having them I mean you
70:53 know this is nothing horrific going on
70:55 in their life just getting older I said
70:58 well what is it
70:59 and essentially what I got from the
71:03 comments I can't remember exactly what
71:05 the person said but it was
71:07 metaphorically attached to the fact that
71:10 in age they were losing the capability
71:14 of just getting up and walking across
71:16 the room of
71:18 having you know the energy that we have
71:20 when we're young and so in the dreams
71:23 the nightmare is that that limitation
71:27 started to manifest in ways that were
71:33 scary I can't walk anymore
71:36 but I want to walk I know how to walk
71:39 I've been walking my whole life can't do
71:41 it and something else and something else
71:44 and something else and I thought wow
71:45 I've lived nearly 50 years in this world
71:48 and I have never heard of anyone having
71:54 that problem having nightmares and I
71:58 think it's interesting that it probably
72:00 is something that is occurring more
72:04 frequent than I know but it it never
72:05 heard it in documentary never heard her
72:07 friends say it and so I think about my
72:10 own you know mortality and you know just
72:14 think about it in 30 years they'll be 80
72:15 years old geez
72:18 30 years old I remember where I was and
72:21 what I was doing with my life it doesn't
72:22 seem like yesterday but doesn't feel
72:25 like 30 years man and it comes out of
72:28 that age old question and we're talking
72:31 about swapping realities first what
72:32 second let's go for that during the
72:34 close here you know how terrifying is
72:37 death if you believe that you're just
72:39 going to another dimension of reality my
72:42 mind is sharp today but will it not be
72:46 as sharp 30 years from now such that my
72:50 grasp of what I'm doing is you know not
72:54 as lucid I assume it will be my family
72:57 lives a long time I mean I have a pretty
72:59 good chance of living another 50 years
73:02 with my genetics but still when I wake
73:08 up and concern myself with will change
73:11 over time most likely diminish there's a
73:15 point in my life where I will not be
73:16 able to physically work anymore
73:18 I could still run my mouth thank God but
73:22 what if my brain you can't do what it
73:25 does the deep thoughts what am i when my
73:27 love's about having created this show
73:29 which was a total mistake is that I'll
73:32 have these
73:33 archives for my family yay yet I had to
73:36 read about my my my relative some of the
73:40 really famous ones what a bullet hole
73:43 Ellis will look him up
73:44 he's my great-great-grandfather maybe
73:47 he's three greats I'm not sure what am i
73:48 I think he might be three greats and
73:51 then my great-great grandfather he Louis
73:56 Allen John he was a Civil War vet
73:59 two-time Civil War vet lived to be 101
74:02 lived a pretty wild life he was an
74:04 inventor he did something based on the
74:08 patent he got on the based on a hey
74:11 combine or something I don't know
74:13 something with agriculture pretty
74:17 interesting but my kids if we don't have
74:20 a giant reset and in this universe which
74:22 you might very well have my kids kids
74:26 kids kids kids oh yeah you wanna know
74:27 your great-grandfather was here's like
74:29 400 episodes 500 episodes of this guy
74:32 yammering around his backyard I'm
74:35 assuming this will be contraband in the
74:37 future right how dare someone think for
74:40 themselves that's interesting so anyway
74:46 I hope you've got a little value out of
74:47 this again no making these summer
74:49 episodes extremely extremely fringy
74:52 just to give them a little bit of sauce
74:54 a little spice and just sort of put
74:58 something out there because I still you
74:59 know I create these shows half the time
75:01 because I have to my brain just has to
75:03 exercise the the subject matter for at
75:06 least an hour so I hope you're enjoying
75:09 it as well a viewership is probably
75:14 about a third of what it was when the
75:16 show is really booming so that's not too
75:18 bad the website is really helping people
75:20 find episodes so you know it's a
75:22 WordPress website but now we have the
75:24 search field on there you go to deep
75:25 thoughts radio calm everything's up
75:28 there search field there's a category
75:31 list on the front page again if you're
75:32 on mobile you gotta scroll past the
75:33 first ten videos there in thumbnail form
75:36 again if you like a particular topic get
75:39 in there and listen to them I can see
75:42 people going through every video in a
75:44 particular category so it's really cool
75:46 so if you
75:46 watching all the dream episodes some
75:48 people watching all the alien episodes
75:49 the moon episodes again I did just move
75:54 430 episodes into some of these
75:58 categories and some of them been in the
76:00 database for a long time so if you see
76:01 anything's wrong let me know just know
76:04 that the the website has all the links
76:06 to the video the audio it has been
76:09 linked to the brand-new season 1 and it
76:12 has the couple ways you can support the
76:14 show which is patreon which is what
76:16 everyone's using to support the show
76:18 again I left PayPal up there but no
76:21 one's using it but yeah for if you're
76:24 out there supporting us that'd be great
76:26 obviously passing the show around to
76:29 your friends and family you know it just
76:31 want to be a little careful make sure
76:32 you pick something that they like
76:33 preface the show with this guy's a
76:34 little edgy excact sort of a
76:36 foul-mouthed sometimes but the content
76:38 is whatever you think it is still
76:41 contemplating season 5 and you should
76:45 know that I think about seasons pretty
76:48 much until about the week before I shoot
76:50 the the intro and then once I shoot the
76:53 intro it takes form and then boom we're
76:55 off to the races so hopefully I can come
76:57 up with a good list of stuff getting a
77:00 lot of good suggestions for me folks
77:01 just know I'm throwing it into multiple
77:05 repositories of my and again if you want
77:09 to really get an episode done on
77:11 something very specific and you know
77:13 it's a giant rabble rabbit hole please
77:16 act like a producer of mine and you know
77:20 give me some bullets give me like five
77:22 to ten bullets of why you think the
77:24 subjects awesome pretend like you work
77:26 for me we're on a show together right
77:28 you're in the studio with me and I just
77:30 come to work and you're like eh you know
77:32 you're not ready for this today but by
77:34 next week you probably should spend your
77:36 off time viewing this these two videos
77:38 and here's what you're going to get and
77:40 I've even given you hot links to various
77:42 minutes in the video that are really the
77:44 the crux of it and if you're expanding
77:49 on something I've already done that
77:50 might also help too you know I've got a
77:53 few of you that chat me regularly and
77:55 the facebook chat just go to the LOC
77:57 Facebook group which is also on the link
77:59 we have a Twitter pages
78:01 and I don't always have time to respond
78:04 because I think that if you take the
78:06 time out to write me something
78:08 intelligent and you deserve an
78:09 intelligent response so I will view you
78:11 a lot of lot of you folks if you know me
78:13 you already know this and you know the
78:15 game you'll post it to me and some of
78:18 you just given me some great stories
78:19 about your life and I love it
78:22 but I might take two weeks to a month to
78:25 get back to you but you know when I
78:26 respond to you it's typically fairly
78:27 in-depth some of you just small talk to
78:30 me and I small talk back and it's always
78:31 very valuable so I appreciate all you
78:33 guys again I want to say if you haven't
78:35 been I don't like Facebook myself okay
78:38 and once we get a replacement all move
78:40 over there but right now it does what it
78:43 does but the group is locked and so any
78:46 comments you make in the Facebook group
78:48 unless your boss were to get into the
78:50 group and I can see anything you do you
78:52 can't even share anything out of the
78:54 group because it's locked so it's our
78:55 own private little place we have some of
78:59 the best folks on planet Earth I'm just
79:01 telling us this and all the episodes but
79:03 I have not been a liar yet hey you know
79:06 we disagree you know I'll post something
79:07 up there and someone's like I think this
79:09 person's a total jerk and edit and I'm
79:10 like okay hey mm right now I don't seem
79:13 to believe that but maybe you'll change
79:15 my mind but even if you don't I don't
79:17 care I mean if you don't change my mind
79:18 are you I don't change yours it's not
79:20 what the purpose of the group is for
79:21 lots of good fun stuff we have some
79:24 great moderators that really pay
79:27 attention to the page all day long like
79:28 we're always sharing the experience of
79:30 approving posts from folks because
79:32 everything's approved so you know
79:36 there's there's a handful of posts that
79:38 don't get approved but not much and
79:40 there's only a handful of people that
79:42 have ever been banned from the Facebook
79:43 page they're not banned but they just
79:46 don't get to comment
79:48 that's super duper rare having to have
79:50 one of those in a long time so anyhow if
79:54 you've been watching deep thoughts for a
79:56 really long time appreciate you for
79:58 hanging on if you just join the site or
