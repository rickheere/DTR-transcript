00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:38 it's another smoked lunch special here
00:42 it's late it's cold outside thought I
00:47 would get something with some heat just
00:50 naturally natural heat of a cigar lounge
00:53 I just realized my cameras in the shot I
00:57 was trying to get a fair amount of
00:58 smokes in the shot thought that'd be
00:59 kind of cool all right as you can see we
01:04 are going to discuss this concept of
01:08 whether or not you and I or maybe just
01:13 us as a singular I guess it's kind of
01:18 strange oh it's kind of an eye as a
01:19 singular are we god and a note for some
01:25 of you who are religious boy that just
01:27 makes the hair on the back here next
01:29 stand up you you some of you will
01:34 probably have said a Hail Mary just
01:35 listening to me say that it's a concept
01:38 I've been thinking about for a really
01:39 long time and I've hinted to it and you
01:44 know creating the universe episode and
01:46 several other existential episodes
01:49 reincarnation episode has a little bit
01:52 of this but I thought you know I haven't
01:55 just barreled into the idea of why would
01:58 this ever be considered first split
02:00 second and I'm not doing it like a lot
02:04 of conspiracy theories that are out
02:05 there just to gain some trend or
02:08 something it's not gonna trend it won't
02:11 there's too much inertia from the
02:12 religious
02:13 factions of the world to allow this to
02:15 proliferate right however for the deep
02:18 thinkers and the deep thinkers if you
02:21 think about a chain of thought a tree of
02:23 thought okay it's often described
02:27 screenwriting is often described as a
02:29 tree every script is a tree and it
02:33 starts at the base and then it migrates
02:36 up and you as the writer are supposed to
02:39 go down every avenue of the branch that
02:43 could exist in this story and explore it
02:45 and find the most entertaining chain of
02:47 events you know I went up that big
02:50 branch and then you know it does medium
02:51 branch and then a teeny branch and then
02:53 it weighted into a bigger branch you
02:54 know the twists and turns as it were but
02:59 a deep thinker will take a single
03:02 subject over a long extended period of
03:04 time for most people because we're not
03:06 Greek Greek philosophers anymore we
03:08 don't sit on the doors or sorry the
03:09 steps of a university in Athens Greece
03:13 and you know pour olive oil on ourselves
03:16 and look at boys I don't know we piece
03:20 it together over time and so this is
03:25 what's happened to me with this idea of
03:28 why do I believe that God is way out
03:31 there why do I believe that because for
03:34 the majority of my life I have and I
03:37 started thinking about it recently and I
03:39 thought well there is a gigantic reason
03:42 why we externalize the spiritual
03:45 orientation or sorry I guess spiritual
03:49 location of God I'm going to tell you a
03:54 funny story and this is uh this is
03:56 really funny because I'm going to give
03:57 it to you in a third degree of sort of
04:00 passing the story along I worked on a
04:03 project with Robert the woman the actor
04:06 from the UK youplease Crichton on Red
04:08 Dwarf you know our good friends we used
04:10 to work together for like ten years and
04:12 all kinds of stuff and we did a project
04:14 he wrote called
04:15 woman wizard and it was about a
04:18 fictitious piece of software where you
04:19 program it with your your spouse your
04:22 girlfriend's personality and then you
04:25 try things on her
04:27 inside the AI instead of ruining your
04:30 marriage and during this presentation he
04:36 drew the cartoons and I did a bunch of
04:38 ton of Photoshop stuff we did about 160
04:40 slides and he toured all over England
04:41 and did this bit at a podium it's
04:44 hilarious
04:45 and he remind he brought to my attention
04:48 this female British writer whose name
04:52 escapes me she's really famous over
04:54 there so it's why I don't quite know
04:55 over here but she wrote a tremendous
04:56 number of books and most of you will
04:59 know her name if you're into that kind
05:00 of thing but she made it a brilliant
05:02 observation that I was told she thought
05:05 of it and she said that women are
05:09 insecure about themselves because they
05:13 have been forced to live with
05:14 uncertainty and she likened it to she
05:18 she essentially said the most
05:19 fundamental level of uncertainty that a
05:21 woman has in this world is her genitalia
05:25 and she's and so I'm you know so he drew
05:30 two cartoons a woman looking down at her
05:32 junk in the waistline and a man looking
05:35 down at his waistline and of course
05:37 there's just a tiny little mound for a
05:40 woman and a man has his phallus so a man
05:43 has the benefit of the certainty of his
05:46 genitalia where it is how it works we
05:49 can get our hands on it right and a
05:52 woman's got all kinds of stuff up inside
05:54 that makes all the stuff tick and pop
05:55 and do all that good stuff but it's not
05:57 the same place for every woman not
05:59 everyone can find it I mean it's really
06:01 complex and that level of uncertainty
06:03 keeps in her opinion guess isn't I'm
06:06 just passing this along keeps women
06:09 initially sort of in a disadvantage why
06:15 mention such a thing the reason I'm
06:18 mentioning this is that we have a very
06:20 similar disjointedness with the universe
06:26 because we exist an X Y Z coordinate
06:28 somewhere in this matrix and this will
06:32 go this actually goes for those who do
06:34 believe in a matrix that this is all a
06:35 computer simulation for some reason that
06:38 brings a lot of comfort to people
06:39 because
06:40 and go see the episode of matrix if you
06:43 like this topic because the idea is you
06:48 know I understand the next level up you
06:51 know if you're a gamer who plays you
06:52 know any massive multiplayer online game
06:55 you you can feel comfortable as you
06:58 understand the creators I understand
07:00 memory and hard drives and that okay but
07:03 your problem reintroduces itself once
07:06 you exit the matrix right think about
07:08 neo in the movie matrix from 1999 right
07:11 Keanu Reeves he gets out of the matrix
07:14 and he's in this thing you know and they
07:18 fix him all up and then he still has the
07:22 universe in his world the robots took it
07:25 over and we're harvesting humans for
07:27 energy right so it turns into a Russian
07:30 doll really really quick you keep
07:33 opening it and there's a little one
07:34 inside and you open down there's a
07:35 little one inside right except for going
07:37 in the opposite direction the more that
07:39 we can conceive of one fabric of the
07:41 universe there's still a higher level of
07:44 the container that makes no sense to us
07:47 that we can't define so at all times no
07:51 matter if this no matter what shape the
07:53 world is no matter what's holding it
07:54 together the other reality is is that we
07:57 I'm sitting in the second floor of a
08:00 smoke lounge okay it surrounded by some
08:03 delicious cigars but there's a catch no
08:08 matter how amazingly confident I feel in
08:12 my own body in this space because I've
08:14 been coming here for two years I know
08:16 how to work the hardware that's making
08:18 this show hopefully it's behaving I
08:19 think I swapped out of power supply to
08:21 get rid of that audio problem the
08:23 majority of the world is out there and I
08:27 know it and that's weird
08:30 when you really think about it it's a
08:32 little bit weird
08:33 and there's the Russian doll as actually
08:38 I'll just just pull that out of my hat
08:39 but that's a great analogy because you
08:41 have your city then you have your state
08:45 or your county then your state then your
08:47 country then your continent then your
08:49 planet whatever shape it is then you
08:53 have to have some sort of
08:54 container for your planet you know some
08:56 people think there's a solar system than
08:58 the universe you know what I'm talking
08:59 about
08:59 and then eventually get out to the
09:01 universe and if you study you know
09:05 cosmology to any level and some
09:07 philosophy you'll start to wonder where
09:10 the hell we are
09:11 and it's that little seed it's that
09:15 little seed that exists sort of as an
09:18 infinite loop of curiosity right imagine
09:24 someone three or four thousand maybe a
09:28 hundred thousand years ago Homo Sapien
09:32 sapien because we've been on this plan a
09:33 lot longer than they said our history
09:35 goes back way further than they say some
09:37 one way back when was wondering what was
09:42 outside their little scratch of land and
09:46 they know that they have to have
09:48 resources to exist and they eventually
09:50 learned that there's predators but then
09:53 you have someone like a Magellan he
09:56 sails all around the place and has a lot
09:58 less curiosity for a little while and
10:01 they starts looking at the infinite
10:03 ocean and going jeez you know I can't
10:05 really cross the oceans I can only you
10:06 know sell around the edges and you get
10:09 someone like Christopher Columbus you
10:10 know it's a [ __ ] character but
10:12 whatever someone who's crossing it the
10:14 Vikings the the Polynesians that found
10:16 Hawaii I mean Jesus you want to think
10:18 about something absolutely nuts think
10:20 about the Polynesians using their boats
10:23 to get to Hawaii and I don't care how
10:24 big you build that boat if you don't
10:26 know it's there and you're sailing out
10:28 there it is a long way
10:31 I just looked that up recently the
10:33 shortest distance from Hawaii to land is
10:36 actually the tip of Alaska it's often
10:40 miscalculated to San Francisco I thought
10:43 it would be to somewhere out west but
10:46 it's not so these guys were not from the
10:49 West that's the interesting thing they
10:50 were from the east right the Polynesians
10:52 least we think so so the extra long
10:56 route and they're going because they
10:57 have this curiosity and then you say
11:00 let's just say there's a NASA astronaut
11:02 or some astronaut that's been up there
11:04 and then all of a sudden you feel like
11:05 you understand the
11:06 the solar system and then it continues
11:08 to expand while Jesus this can't be an
11:12 infinite universe with infinite stuff in
11:16 it because the stuff would have to
11:17 infinitely create itself or maybe it's
11:19 an is well nothing's truly infinite
11:22 because if there was if there were
11:23 infinite stars in the universe then
11:25 everything would be compact star stuff
11:27 right if there was an infinite number of
11:30 hot dogs in the universe well it would
11:33 be hot dogs everywhere so whatever the
11:36 container is it's bigger than everything
11:38 that's inside it gets really crazy right
11:42 the reason why I'm going down this path
11:44 is there is some point where we we
11:51 understand that the the perceivable
11:54 reality in what we've been taught in our
11:56 brains the way our brains interpret
11:58 information photons sound waves ether
12:04 all currents in general they turn into
12:06 electricity or whatever thought
12:07 processes we have this distinct
12:10 confirmation that everything's outside
12:12 of us and that kicks off a mould on
12:18 spirituality
12:20 you know man when man started to engage
12:23 in burial ceremonies man started to
12:26 engage in a belief of an existential
12:29 ecosystem to life at a minimum right
12:32 they believe that we are here that we
12:34 die and we go someplace else
12:36 and that we need to prepare for it you
12:38 know by the time of the Pharaohs which
12:40 is probably about 40,000 BC according to
12:45 recent research man they were harvesting
12:48 organs and putting em and you know
12:50 scented little Ganis canisters and all
12:53 kinds of rituals and preparing you know
12:55 for the Pharaoh to hunt in the afterlife
12:57 I mean do you realize how many tens of
13:00 thousands of years it took to come up
13:02 with such an elaborate burial process
13:05 embalming tools that are built out of
13:07 melts it melts at meteorites so they're
13:09 pure iron and they have a radioactive
13:11 signature that doesn't match earth but
13:14 the one thing that is not I think an
13:16 obvious arc in our brain as human beings
13:20 all right is that we we actually
13:23 participate in the creation of the
13:25 universe and I don't mean yeah of course
13:27 I built a house I built the doghouse and
13:29 polished my car yeah we all know we
13:32 participate in our immediate universe
13:33 but the laws of the universe the math
13:36 that holds it all together that I often
13:38 talk about on this show we always
13:40 assumed that it was written by someone
13:45 else created by someone else and it if
13:49 you really dive into the notion of the
13:52 mathematics the holding universe
13:53 together as I've said in several
13:54 episodes the program that is this
13:57 universe and you can call it the matrix
13:59 however you want it's fine there's some
14:03 truth to that statement no matter what
14:04 it is all right we don't create math we
14:07 discover math right we don't create the
14:09 laws of the universe we discover the
14:10 laws of the universe well think about
14:13 starting from an absolute nothing and
14:15 then all of this being created or then
14:20 there's the is right
14:22 why even debate whether or not we're God
14:25 and what do I mean by our we got here's
14:28 my model for why this subject comes to
14:31 mind and will not go away the more that
14:35 I think about a single Supreme Being
14:37 being omnipotent like the QED having
14:43 essentially zero unknown knowledge right
14:47 the God that we always talk about it is
14:51 a God that knows absolutely everything
14:52 all the time and that's massive that God
14:58 can't get angry that God also can't get
15:00 happy that God is essentially as as much
15:04 of an is as it gets and then there's a
15:09 part when you really conceive of that
15:10 which doesn't take that much effort you
15:12 just have to shift your brain a little
15:14 bit away from doctor nation your heart
15:18 will hurt for a split second if you
15:20 allow God to remain that definition but
15:24 that is truly the definition that all
15:26 organized religions with an external God
15:29 come up with whether or not they
15:31 understand what their definite
15:33 implies they are actually implying that
15:39 God has it all and I don't think we want
15:44 our God to be stuck in that room and hey
15:46 reality is reality whether or not I know
15:49 it or believe it so it could be that way
15:52 I mean Gandhi was quoted as saying the
15:55 truth is the truth regardless if you
15:57 believe it or not or know it or not I
15:59 love that and that's so going to be one
16:03 of the scaffolding pieces that holds us
16:05 this episode together we're searching
16:07 for it right so how do we go from that
16:11 idea that idea that we're sort of like
16:13 man you know God would be essentially
16:18 the video game engine code in that
16:23 definition of reality right he is the
16:26 Unreal Engine the Tech 5 engine the
16:29 Crytek engine unity right but we want
16:35 God to be compassionate we want God to
16:37 react to what we do if we say a prayer
16:40 for something and then we want that to
16:42 have an effect but prayers maybe work a
16:45 different way than we think in terms of
16:48 their cause and effect right like I said
16:52 my exits existential episode what if the
16:54 biggest secret of the universe that
16:56 you're never told is that we control the
16:59 universe we control it that's why people
17:03 like Steve Jobs who simply believe in
17:05 what he's doing he has he had a reality
17:08 distortion field around him they always
17:10 talked about that I've got friends with
17:12 those distortion fields I think I've had
17:14 those distortion fields I think we've
17:15 all had the distortion field when you
17:18 just believe something's gonna happen
17:19 and it can physically happen in the
17:22 universe which means your expectations
17:25 or your desires and your belief system
17:26 and the way the universe works perfectly
17:29 you know becomes parallel it starts to
17:33 resonate reality you created that's what
17:36 the secrets abouts what's what the bleep
17:37 do we know is about right the reason why
17:40 I take that little tiny diversion is
17:42 that some of people believe in an
17:45 external God because
17:47 prayers get answered according to them
17:49 right and of course there's always that
17:52 little rub when everyone prays for a
17:55 loved one who's dying and some people
17:57 get the answer and the form of life and
18:00 some people get the answer in the form
18:02 of death and usually neither party loses
18:05 faith in God
18:06 no virus one that pulls through they
18:10 have probably a reinforced belief in God
18:12 but even the ones where the relative
18:13 passes away or what have you
18:15 we at least you know concede and we go
18:17 to our our burial ceremonies well at
18:19 least that being is now with God as I
18:23 mentioned in a few episodes people have
18:26 a problem believing in God a lot of
18:29 times especially Stephen Fry he's the
18:32 famous British comedian over there as
18:34 well he has a hard time believing in God
18:37 because children suffer and what blows
18:41 me away about that is that it's pitched
18:43 as this unbelievably profound
18:46 realization about the universe and when
18:48 it is probably one of the most remedial
18:51 knee-jerk reactions to what's going on
18:53 this planet Stephen Fry in my opinion
18:56 who's very intelligent very talented guy
18:59 in my opinion he hasn't really stopped
19:01 to think anything through if we designed
19:06 the universe because we are the
19:08 occupants
19:09 we are the conscious beings who in this
19:12 particular iteration are pulling in a
19:14 human you know or a symbiotic
19:16 relationship with a human body maybe
19:18 this is our favorite form maybe there
19:20 are no other forms now there's a lot of
19:21 animals that have some pretty beautiful
19:24 personalities right but if we are the
19:27 creators of the universe and we are not
19:30 this flesh and bone right here right
19:33 then what we are perhaps doesn't die
19:38 when we die and so we renew now we have
19:41 all of these experiences from folks
19:44 who've medically been pronounced dead
19:47 their bodies cease to function normally
19:50 heart stopped functioning brain stopped
19:53 functioning they are dead tracked by
19:56 machines their soul lifts out of their
19:58 body they look down on themselves and
20:00 they travel far away
20:01 and they talk about this central
20:03 consciousness in many cases but they run
20:06 into that is one the nice news is is
20:08 again outside of one guy in New York who
20:11 said he thought he went to hell when he
20:14 did something can't remember what he was
20:15 doing I don't think it was an
20:17 out-of-body experience but I'm sorry I
20:19 don't think it was a death experiencing
20:21 it was just an out-of-body experience
20:22 but I haven't heard a out-of-body
20:25 experience related to a near-death
20:27 experience that went to hell I think
20:30 that's pretty encouraging right but
20:32 there is this amazing loving beautiful
20:34 place for those who take DMT the dream
20:37 molecule that's become very popular in
20:40 the last five years kind of settling
20:42 down you hear Joe Rogan talk about it I
20:44 Graham Norton talk about it or say
20:46 Graham Hancock no no by Graham Norton
20:49 it's a British comedian episode here but
20:53 they talk about meeting other beings
20:55 that have rules as a matter of fact
20:57 which is very interesting there's a
21:01 whole spin on grey aliens you know
21:04 there's that side weird thing where
21:06 they're you know they're turning into
21:08 demons because then that that catalyzes
21:11 other religious doctrines to protect you
21:13 right the whole thing with religions is
21:15 that they're there to manipulate you
21:17 through fear all right
21:19 fear of not getting back to God as if
21:22 you could exist without being with God
21:24 nuts right but let's stop for one second
21:29 and let's look at this idea of us being
21:31 God what I mean by that is that we
21:35 decided this universe we decided how it
21:39 was put together and this is not to
21:42 arrogantly take away anything from the
21:46 traditional belief of a central
21:47 consciousness which might be again the
21:49 operating system the question is it's
21:52 the chicken and the egg the operating
21:53 system simply exists and we inherited it
21:56 when whatever we found consciousness or
21:59 were we always alive and there was
22:03 nothing nothing like this there was no
22:05 ether wind to turn into physics turn
22:07 into you know all the particles in the
22:09 universe that we classify do their
22:11 Wiggles and spins did we invent that
22:14 I don't know and then there's this thing
22:17 of a singular God all right you know
22:21 there when you get into pluralism you
22:25 get into this idea that there are idols
22:29 out there and everyone worships
22:31 different idols based on hey I want a
22:33 fertility Idol I want to it's gonna make
22:35 it rain Idol I want an American Idol oh
22:39 that always seemed hokey to me that's
22:43 what the Egyptians believed right
22:45 eventually the Native Americans had rain
22:48 dances everyone who had agriculture back
22:51 in the day when if you didn't get a good
22:53 crop you couldn't harvest you died in
22:55 the sign of the Scorpion when winter hit
22:58 which is why it's there in the zodiac
23:00 teach farmers how to get their [ __ ]
23:03 together get it all grain in the granary
23:05 they all had these dances these rituals
23:09 these beliefs he superstitions but once
23:12 we consolidated everything down and
23:14 pretty much endorsed this this sort of
23:17 subtextual theme that as it is above so
23:20 to it is below meaning the rules that
23:22 govern us at this level will govern all
23:24 the way up then there begs this question
23:26 does this stop right there are there a
23:31 bunch of us as truly individual souls
23:35 where you're living at the same time I
23:38 living I'm living right I go outside I
23:40 can shake someone's hand I don't feel
23:41 like I'm them they don't feel like
23:43 they're me because in that paradigm in
23:45 this paradigm of existence time is
23:48 linear you can't have two people at the
23:50 same time living at the same time you
23:54 know sci-fi movies there's all kinds of
23:55 loopholes in space-time and it can occur
23:59 but I haven't experienced that
24:01 personally but then we have this other
24:05 idea if we adopt this notion the time is
24:10 merely an illusion created by the fact
24:12 that you can store a memory of this
24:14 particular instance of life and you can
24:17 trace back and say gosh I remember when
24:19 I was 2 3 4 5 6 7 years old I know that
24:24 time exists I'm recording this right now
24:27 I can see right now
24:28 what time I have recorded on this
24:30 particular thing I'm looking down on my
24:31 computer doing the the sound waves we
24:34 believe time exists well it's a paradigm
24:36 of thought and within the paradigm of
24:39 thought it absolutely does exist but
24:41 whether or not the universe acknowledges
24:43 it yeah you never know right I did an
24:47 episode on time travel in Episode one
24:48 their season one excuse me and it's all
24:52 about the idea that time is a static
24:56 matrix of all things that could happen
24:58 every single variable of how you could
25:00 think what you could say next how you
25:03 could even form the words you know you
25:05 could live the same exact life but your
25:06 voice sounds a little strange your whole
25:08 life it's all just there and it is and
25:13 your consciousness is your being your
25:18 life force falling through this whole
25:22 matrix like a Borg cube it's really
25:24 truly infinite but you're going through
25:27 and picking the very next memory socket
25:30 that you're going to encounter and that
25:32 is why some of us believe that the
25:35 secret about the universe and the
25:37 ability to choose the next second right
25:41 is made possible because all you're
25:44 doing is choosing the next socket that
25:46 you're living in right it could be a
25:48 jerk you could be a nice guy you could
25:50 be somewhere in the middle 9/11 happened
25:53 for a lot of us and I love and didn't
25:54 happen for a lot of us and the
25:56 interesting thing is for anything that
25:58 did occur in the universe in this model
26:01 most people didn't experience it only a
26:04 tiny bit of folks actually experienced
26:07 him but for everything you didn't
26:08 experience they experience the other
26:10 thing it's really complicated pretty
26:14 quickly right but in that model if the
26:17 universe was a static big chunk of
26:20 everything that could possibly occur all
26:21 you're doing is falling through the
26:23 pachinko game then there's nothing
26:26 stopping you from holding every single
26:29 role that has ever held by a living life
26:33 force meaning you have been every single
26:35 human that's ever existed every aliens
26:38 ever existed bug whatever kitchen table
26:42 you've been a kitchen table once there
26:45 was this theory that was put out there
26:47 and again you kind of have to roll your
26:48 eyes a little bit that this was hatched
26:53 by well I can't see it's hatched by but
26:56 the first time I ever heard was reading
26:57 one of Hawking Stephen W Hawking's books
26:59 where he was talking about the atomic
27:02 mass at the edge of a black hole and he
27:07 was saying that that a a single atom has
27:12 that every infinite past and every
27:14 infinite future that it could ever
27:16 possibly have which means there's only
27:19 one atom in the whole universe
27:21 that's absurd exercise and thinking on
27:25 one level but imagine that was possible
27:29 that one little orbiting something or
27:32 other is portraying everything that you
27:35 could possibly experience and you think
27:37 you're in a three-dimensional are you in
27:38 fourth dimensional world with time but
27:41 you're actually only in one place just
27:44 vibrating your butt off and you can
27:46 vibrate from start to finish over and
27:48 over and over all these different
27:49 sequences and it loops in on itself it's
27:51 an infinite sphere turn inside and out
27:53 inside out so yours in as much as you're
27:55 out right there's this saying that it's
27:59 kind of a cop-out which is God works in
28:02 mysterious ways now there's a lot of
28:05 bliss and happiness on the other side of
28:07 that phrase if you believe it because
28:10 you just say man I got to I got to focus
28:12 on the now I got to focus on my life and
28:14 there's luck that can be accomplished
28:16 with that philosophers if anything they
28:20 are climbing out of the bathtub of the
28:22 now to analyze what what potentially has
28:26 happened in the past but more
28:27 importantly the cause and effect model
28:29 of what's going to happen in the future
28:31 because if you can predict the future
28:33 well think about how much control you
28:35 have over your own life there's that
28:38 fascinating reality about psychologists
28:40 and the fascinating reality is that a
28:44 lot of psychologists become
28:46 psychologists because they have issues
28:48 with themselves that they want to
28:51 resolve and so they've went out on this
28:54 adventure and then they realized
28:56 in the end while Jesus not as messed up
28:58 as all these people maybe I can charge
29:00 them money to come inside us room and
29:02 sit down and talk to me about it so I
29:04 can go counsel them somewhere and thank
29:06 God they exist right but we're all a
29:08 little bit like that right I think that
29:12 one can dismantle quite successfully the
29:15 notion of God works in mysterious ways
29:21 again that saying probably hatched a
29:23 long time ago in a different language
29:25 and was passed up and translated to just
29:28 explain stuff right and a lot of times
29:30 it would be when we believe we are
29:33 entitled to a certain level of success
29:36 remember I always say on the show life
29:38 is fair anything can happen and that's
29:40 what pisses us off about it well we
29:42 typically define as life being fair is
29:46 that we want it to be unfair I don't
29:50 ever want to run out of money I don't
29:52 ever want to be unhappy that's fair
29:56 right I deserve I deserve not to be
29:58 unhappy I deserve to have everything go
30:01 well and on a really fundamental level
30:04 most people can get on board with that
30:05 thinking one of the super tough things
30:10 that is tough for all of us to deal with
30:13 is the notion of losing a loved one
30:16 early the most horrific version is
30:19 obviously losing a child that hasn't had
30:21 a chance to live their lives I don't
30:25 think there's anything more intense than
30:26 that losing your own lives yeah we can
30:29 write our own life off right I mean
30:31 obviously most of us don't want to do
30:33 such a thing as we got some other plans
30:34 going on but when you see a child who's
30:37 blameless losing their life due to
30:40 probably someone else's negligence in a
30:42 lot of cases whether they die of a
30:45 disease which is a result of you know a
30:48 society looking the other wave when
30:49 cancerous foods come out too much sugar
30:52 too much salt GMOs toxins in the skies
30:55 toxins in the water toxins in the
30:57 toothpaste right we really wonder why
31:00 kids get sick and die right
31:02 that is when we can't resolve the
31:06 thought
31:08 and there's all colors this real
31:10 interesting category of psychology when
31:13 the human mind can't resolve something
31:17 there's pain and pleasure at that apex
31:20 when when man has been scientifically
31:22 proven to be presented something they
31:24 can't resolve right
31:26 PTSD is based on being concussed
31:31 typically or overwhelmed and mentally
31:33 with a horrible thing and but the memory
31:36 goes into long-term storage and the
31:40 event itself is not recorded properly
31:42 and so the soldier leaves the
31:45 battlefield has nothing to do with being
31:47 a wimp that's what I used to think as a
31:50 child when I used to hear about
31:51 shell-shocked notes I thought well I
31:53 don't really mean to say the word wimp
31:55 what I mean to say is you've got an 18
31:56 year old kid in 1944 okay they didn't
32:00 have much of horror movies and crazy
32:02 scary stuff and they did have some
32:03 Dracula and Frankenstein stuff but
32:05 nothing like war and then they are in
32:08 Dresden when all these bombs are dropped
32:10 and they're shocked they are literally
32:13 seeing something so overwhelming there's
32:15 no precursor to it there's nothing now
32:18 kids if you were in that realm you take
32:21 a knight 2017 kid 2018 kid
32:23 we're gonna roll my ear there and you
32:25 put them in anything in battle
32:27 well they've seen Michael Bay movies
32:29 they've played tons of video games of
32:31 war now even though the real [ __ ] is way
32:34 different you know when a 500-pound
32:36 ordinance hits the ground tenth of a
32:38 mile away and it shakes the earth like
32:40 an earthquake
32:41 you start to realize well this is not a
32:43 game anymore right
32:44 but there's two things that happen when
32:46 the brain can't process something two
32:49 very distinct things there's not just
32:51 two but there's obviously probably an
32:53 infinite amount of things that happen to
32:54 you and you can't resolve something but
32:56 one of them is laughter and one of them
32:59 is something called TMS TMS has been
33:03 known for quite some time and it is
33:08 where your body will starve oxygen from
33:11 your muscles to distract you from a
33:14 thought that's about to come into your
33:15 brain or a thought that it's being
33:16 pushed on you that you don't want to
33:19 think and
33:20 shows up in back pain usually there's
33:23 been countless back exploration
33:26 surgeries where people destroy their
33:28 spinal cords and destroy all their
33:30 natural beautiful balanced tissue
33:33 because they're looking for something
33:34 going on back there when it really has
33:36 to do with some psychological issue
33:39 either be at their childhood or
33:41 something that's recently occurred that
33:45 gives them stress and there was a mash
33:49 episode where Hawkeye had this big
33:52 problem there I think it was in the
33:53 crown recently where someone gets
33:57 stressed out and had a back problem you
34:01 know I went and saw a chiropractor to
34:03 get rid of it was all stress-related
34:04 right and the guy recommended hey you
34:06 should go off and go to this little
34:08 swinger party and get some stress off
34:10 because the old lady ain't putting out
34:12 right and he doesn't get some trouble
34:14 right but what if God doesn't really
34:16 work in a mysterious way what if
34:20 everything that we can't describe and
34:22 can't explain in the split second trauma
34:23 of the moment because our brains aren't
34:25 working well remember if you go see my
34:28 left brain right brain or trauma
34:30 journalism episode when you're
34:34 traumatized your brain goes into reserve
34:37 mode it knocks out a lot of the chatter
34:40 from the right brain and goes down to a
34:42 really low blood supply to the left
34:44 brain and goes into extinction
34:45 instinctual mode to survive so if you
34:49 ever turn the corner of your garage or
34:52 your house and there's a big African
34:55 lion they're just drooling looks a
34:59 little tattered looks a little pissed
35:00 off looks hungry and there is no place
35:03 for you to go your brain is gonna dump
35:06 the right brain in two seconds no more
35:09 creativity you're not worried about what
35:11 tie you wore whether or not you're
35:12 wearing adidas you are gonna go off and
35:16 try to save your own life in every
35:19 single tool and weapon that you could
35:20 possibly have at your disposal will go
35:22 right in front of your face like a HUD
35:24 heads-up display some people will just
35:27 go into complete shock and freeze up
35:29 because they get so rubbed because
35:31 they're so terrified even the left brain
35:33 gets complete
35:34 the contracted of its blood and that's
35:37 why you freeze up that's why a lot of
35:40 people when they get older can't
35:41 remember things because they're told
35:43 that when you get older your memory dies
35:45 out a little bit and he'll it probably
35:48 does but if you start to fear that
35:50 you're gonna forget things and then you
35:53 just do a natural forgetful thing like
35:55 young people do you start to get more
35:57 anxiety every single time you need to
35:59 retrieve information from the deep
36:01 database that is your long-term storage
36:03 and you will build anxiety loops giving
36:07 yourself this notion that you can't
36:09 remember my friends who are very
36:12 confident and very successful people
36:17 artists I should say they don't forget
36:21 anything and it's the more I want to say
36:24 it's like they're confident and maybe
36:26 they even have a little bit of arrogance
36:28 in them and that's just the freakin
36:30 bulldozer that pushes through all of
36:33 this issue right but the ones that are
36:37 kind of BS in their careers they're
36:39 lying about what they did they take
36:40 credit for things that other people did
36:42 and so they kind of know they're a fraud
36:44 they're a walking fraud well they're not
36:47 as confident the fragile and when they
36:51 go for that memory boom it's not there
36:54 how many times you said oh I just had it
36:57 on the tip of my tongue that's a little
36:59 tiny micro version of the same thing you
37:01 were going for a memory trying to
37:02 remember that actor's name that movie
37:03 name and boy for a split second you saw
37:06 it but winded up happening is that
37:08 vision that Gestalt of what you're
37:10 looking for gets cut off by the fear
37:13 boom right reason why I'm going through
37:17 this real subatomic stuff is because
37:21 this is the clutter I believe we have to
37:24 clear out of the way to consider the
37:26 notion that maybe we participate a lot
37:30 more in the creation of the universe
37:31 than we previously thought now I did
37:35 create an episode called creating the
37:37 universe and it is its subplot is this
37:40 plot okay but not a lot of people
37:43 watched in that old episode so that
37:45 again we're gonna barrel it is 100
37:47 but let me plagiarize myself just a
37:49 little bit from that episode let's go
37:52 for the one of the most traumatic things
37:54 that could possibly happen to a parent
37:55 to any human being in general but your
37:59 child passes away
38:01 doesn't matter how doesn't matter how
38:05 you know in your mind of minds that as a
38:08 designer of the universe as a human
38:11 being in the context of a homo sapien
38:14 sapien on whatever the hell this place
38:16 is that we call earth we would never
38:20 ever allow a child to pass away but at
38:26 some point we would have to let go of
38:27 that grip right well you gonna live
38:31 forever well then you'll become the cue
38:32 from Star Trek and you'll will try to
38:34 commit suicide because you will have
38:35 experienced everything and never
38:37 forgotten anything you'll become Nirvana
38:39 the hell version of the hervana Nirvana
38:42 right the Buddhist figured all this out
38:44 a long time ago people it is my belief
38:47 that we were born into the other state
38:49 of not having a vessel that could die
38:53 which I believe is what we call the soul
38:55 the soul never dies that's just my
38:58 opinion and that's not me being a coward
39:04 from the notion of well you just don't
39:06 want to die you want to you think you're
39:08 so valuable no not really I just think
39:11 we're if you had something in the room
39:13 in this room if I had a shot put
39:16 right well those big metal balls like
39:18 the one from rollerball and we're in
39:21 this room together and there's no window
39:22 there's no doors or it's locked or
39:24 whatever and I say make this disappear
39:27 you know you can't the only thing you
39:30 could possibly do is hide it from me but
39:32 that means it still exists I just can't
39:34 see it or you could mush it and change
39:36 it into a different shape but it's still
39:38 there you just messed with it that's the
39:42 principle of the soul not dying
39:44 you can't hide energy in the universe
39:47 you merely can can reclassify it as
39:50 perhaps mass right a log is mass in this
39:55 physics crappy you know science pop
39:58 science stuff that we have in this world
39:59 when you burn it
40:00 you're creating a chain reaction of
40:02 velocity changes in nuclear bond changes
40:04 the ether is being exacerbated by flames
40:07 and it's all thermal izing well the
40:10 large part of the of the log can't
40:12 thermalize then it goes back to carbon
40:14 the base component of the universe the
40:16 rest goes into thermal heat some of it
40:18 kind of swims between it becomes ash
40:22 some of it puts off funny chemicals cuz
40:25 it's not a real long right so there's my
40:27 explicit belief that the soul can't die
40:30 now even the human body ashes to ashes
40:34 and dust to dust we know that we bury
40:38 ourselves in this planet and you know
40:40 out of some probably insecurity and
40:43 veinous and I'm one of them some of us
40:47 put ourselves in coffins because we
40:49 don't want to really think about you
40:50 know decomposing we want to be dead
40:53 before we think about our loved ones
40:55 decomposing but we know there's
40:57 reincarnation of the energy on this
40:59 planet all right we know that our body
41:02 doesn't drift into space just because we
41:04 died we believe our salt does atheists
41:07 don't but they can't explain anything
41:09 this just give up you know they're the
41:12 most non intellectual people pretending
41:15 to be intellectual that I've ever met in
41:18 my life most of us in the world are
41:20 agnostic we just go you know we don't
41:22 know on this show we're trying to get to
41:24 the bottom of some of this thinking
41:25 right so with those couple little
41:28 principles in place you can't hide
41:31 anything
41:31 it's got to continue to exist in our
41:34 life force I don't think is bound at all
41:36 by our bodies which is why we have these
41:38 near-death testimonies that have gone on
41:40 for thousands of years and all have a
41:43 similarity to them and virtually none of
41:47 them have Jesus Christ none of them have
41:49 God and none of them have the devil they
41:52 have beauty and Wonder and and all the
41:56 pain goes away and all that good stuff
41:57 right we always say that you want what
42:01 you don't have because it seems as if
42:05 energy patterns which we know exist
42:08 right if you ever take LSD and look up
42:11 in the sky you will definitely see
42:12 diamonds in the sky
42:14 let me Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds I
42:16 swear to God you look up there and light
42:18 is there's amazing patterns that you've
42:21 seen your whole life you've seen them in
42:22 floor tiles you've seen them in carpet
42:25 mosaics you see it when you play sound
42:29 waves and you have the black piece of
42:31 paper with the whites and those patterns
42:33 of some of those frequencies is exactly
42:35 what you see when you look at the sky
42:36 and everything that's bright in the sky
42:38 turns into like this this constellation
42:40 of patterns and you can take it today
42:44 and you'll see those patterns and you
42:45 can wait 10 years and take it again
42:46 you'll see the same patterns it's crazy
42:49 it's like it really exists but when
42:51 we're not released a little bit with
42:53 this LSD we don't see it it's
42:57 interesting death is something that is
43:01 utterly terrifying and saddening in this
43:04 world
43:05 for some it's definitely saddening I
43:08 think for most people I don't think no
43:09 matter how much you believe in an
43:11 afterlife or a reincarnation of any kind
43:13 or whatever God and deity you believe in
43:16 death never really feels good and it's
43:19 mainly because we miss people you know
43:22 obviously when it happens to a child we
43:24 think that you know we all share that
43:26 injustice feeling I feel it you know
43:28 even though I might believe everything
43:29 I'm saying this episode and I don't want
43:32 a kid to die I didn't want a kid to get
43:34 sick but I know that if we were to
43:37 sanitize the rules of the universe it'd
43:40 be a really strange mathematical model
43:42 for the universe to somehow inhibit and
43:43 protect children it could be a mechanism
43:46 to fight war right if a child could
43:48 never die then you know Saddam Hussein
43:51 could just attach a bunch of babies to
43:53 his body and walk around Baghdad every
43:55 single day and you couldn't kill him
43:56 because these children are protecting
43:57 him because the universe says no way you
44:01 see how crazy you can get really really
44:03 fast whatever is the principle of the
44:07 universe it must sort of be an absolute
44:11 principle it can't vary in its in its
44:14 discretion I think the greatest gift to
44:17 infinite life
44:18 which is our soul is the ability to be
44:21 born anew with definitely some instincts
44:27 of perhaps
44:28 we're who you are as a soul right again
44:30 we have old souls and young souls I
44:32 don't know quite how that happens I
44:33 don't know if that's really the age of
44:35 the soul or if it's simply the the
44:39 number of times that one has been human
44:41 maybe an old soul it's just someone
44:43 who's been human several times and so we
44:45 kind of get back in you know it's like
44:47 riding a bike
44:48 after you haven't ridden one I haven't
44:50 ridden a bicycle and so long that I have
44:53 no idea the last time I rode a bicycle
44:55 is that not funky and weird but I know I
44:58 could balance a bicycle right I just had
45:01 a little BMX back when I was a kid the
45:04 Schwinn phantom 1978 I think when the
45:08 first BMX bicycle bikes were coming out
45:10 we did tricks we jump Brants we did all
45:12 kinds of stuff you won't catch me doing
45:15 that again brother
45:15 right but being human allows us to have
45:21 a very contextual experience how many of
45:25 you would like to float in the universe
45:27 let's just say that you're your soul
45:29 feels warm there's no pain okay but
45:34 you're gonna just float in the universe
45:35 forever now you're gonna have a planet
45:38 go by and a moon go by and a Sun go by
45:40 yeah maybe you bump into a planet and
45:43 then something happens oh my gosh
45:46 if you don't bounce off the planet and
45:48 you stay on that planet it's got
45:50 something interesting it's not like your
45:51 rope but it's not just a big chunk of
45:53 ice but it's another earth like in class
45:55 planet I meet some Navi hey man that's
45:59 pretty cool what is this stuff Oh
46:00 guano pretty wild right you start to
46:04 have this contextual experience that's
46:06 rich that's interesting and if you
46:09 design life properly well then you get
46:13 to have creation within the subset of
46:15 being this other thing imagine as a god
46:20 okay and again I know that sounds
46:23 offensive for some of you but if you
46:26 were an equal player in this game when
46:28 you're not in your body when you have
46:30 all the information and universe
46:31 returned to you right you can create
46:34 anything all the time again you're a Q
46:36 its Gene Roddenberry's greatest creation
46:40 his entire career and it's so fantastic
46:44 and so beautiful and I'm sure there's
46:46 tales of other folks that are cues and
46:48 plenty of stories I haven't read so I'm
46:50 probably giving a little too much credit
46:53 to him but he's the he's my hero for
46:55 this particular one it plugs me to think
46:58 about being a cue it's almost as if if I
47:02 woke up being a cue after being dead
47:05 you know I die here and I going off and
47:07 I become a cue you know I might play
47:09 around just a little bit but I'm gonna
47:12 want to get back into a human body or
47:14 something that has a start middle and
47:17 end a beginning middle and end at some
47:19 point there are a lot of you who watch
47:22 this show who have had this experience
47:26 where you have tapped into the universe
47:28 like philip k dick has tapped into the
47:31 universe i have the whole episode on
47:33 being gnostic which is my particular
47:36 interpretation of that word and what it
47:39 means that all the rules of the universe
47:41 and all the information and all the
47:42 lineage of truth which has a frequency
47:45 right truth has a frequency lies have a
47:47 different frequency truth i believe has
47:51 a very long wave a very beautiful
47:53 sensual uplifting invigorating
47:57 energizing frequency and that's why you
48:01 feel wonderful when you feel the truth
48:03 and when you tell a lie whether it be a
48:07 tiny little white light to keep a child
48:08 from knowing what's in the christmas
48:10 present all the way up to some
48:13 ingredients really fascinating about it
48:22 is no matter if you're a bad guy or a
48:24 good guy let's just say you're bad guy
48:27 so I'm crazy serial killer unless the
48:31 brain has completely been demented and
48:33 it happens right you have son of Sam's
48:35 and you know these killers these serial
48:37 killers those are probably the only
48:39 people that actually conduct horrific
48:42 things that don't feel horrific about
48:43 what they've done but I think that's a
48:47 fraction of a fraction of a fraction of
48:49 percent of human beings that have ever
48:50 lived lack that moral come
48:53 inside themselves but isn't it
48:55 interesting that the human body can be
48:57 so corrupted whether it's bad genetics
48:59 bad chemicals they messed with genetics
49:01 or some abusive mental conditioning
49:05 people start hurting animals and stuff
49:07 parents torture kids and they become
49:10 horrible people it almost never happens
49:13 to be honest but apparently we have
49:17 allowed all these people to run the
49:19 world what's fascinating about you know
49:23 understanding the universe from the
49:27 perspective I just defined that we would
49:29 indeed allow children to die because in
49:32 our minds as omnipotent Souls death
49:36 isn't death at all ever we know that the
49:41 second that a child's body passes away
49:43 for any reason whether it be accident or
49:46 intent we know that their soul
49:48 immediately escapes the horrific
49:51 situation that caused this in the first
49:53 place if they're surrounded by evil
49:55 people doing stuff then they escape from
49:59 that and they move on and they
50:00 immediately get coddled by the rest of
50:04 us waiting on the outside you know to
50:07 disclose my model a little bit further
50:10 in my own mind at this stage of this
50:12 recording there is still a obvious
50:16 chicken and egg problem with even my
50:18 assertion of this notion whether we all
50:21 participate in a hive mind to become
50:23 individual souls and we actually are
50:25 physically different Souls right people
50:27 will take DMT say they see you know all
50:30 kinds of light beings creatures and
50:32 light creatures and these these aliens
50:33 gray aliens they talk about meeting them
50:35 and I think it's fascinating that
50:38 everyone has a very similar experience
50:39 although unique right it does seem like
50:43 there's a lot of empirical evidence if
50:45 you're willing to take those experiences
50:47 at face value that that there are
50:50 gazillions of souls and I would I would
50:54 wager that and unless there's a really
50:57 strange anomaly going on most of them
51:00 have never been human before we just
51:03 happen to be the ones that are human
51:04 right now
51:05 but someone has to design the human
51:07 somehow I mean we are an amazing being
51:13 right there's a lot of amazing creatures
51:16 in this world I mean from insects all
51:18 the way up I'm always talking about that
51:19 right I see us participating in the
51:23 design of our own world
51:25 and I think that you know there's
51:29 something very interesting about what
51:32 you know when you look at certain things
51:33 in the world there's a certain
51:35 interesting familiarity with things in
51:38 the world all things it's strange how we
51:42 feel familiar sometimes through these
51:43 things could just be the process of
51:47 reincarnation you know when you look at
51:50 it and one thing is really funny about
51:52 smoking cigars is that if I if you never
51:57 smoked a cigar before and I grab one of
51:59 these Monte Cristo's here it's like
52:00 smoking here let me give it to you and I
52:02 tell you how not to inhale we light it
52:04 and we sit and we talk and you're having
52:05 a interesting puffing experience you're
52:07 having this interesting texture boy you
52:09 never had a big thick cigar in your
52:11 mouth but the idea is you might really
52:13 enjoy it and you're gonna be getting
52:15 some bold interesting taste a little bit
52:18 of spice your tongue is gonna feel a
52:20 little sizzle on it from that particular
52:22 stick right but then I start moving
52:26 around the cabinets here and I start
52:28 giving you you know we move up from a
52:32 $12 stick to a $15 stick than a $20
52:34 stick then a $30 stick about 30 you're
52:38 good you've had all the good stuff we
52:40 can go up to thousands of dollars per
52:41 stick but you know what'll end up
52:44 happening is you develop your palate
52:46 there's that there's a tie-in for this
52:49 when you discern and slow down your mind
52:53 and you take in your your nasal retro
52:56 hell and your tongue I know I don't do a
53:00 lot of retro howling on this show
53:01 because it's a little disruptive to the
53:03 flow of the show but you will start to
53:06 pick out half-a-dozen flavors if I give
53:10 you if I give you that Monte Cristo
53:12 today and you've never smoked a cigar in
53:13 your life and then two years later and
53:15 you continue to smoke cigars and I give
53:17 you a two years later I give you that
53:18 one
53:18 Christel again tell me what you taste
53:20 they call it tasting notes your first
53:22 day you're gonna maybe have one or two
53:24 notes
53:25 tobacco and I don't know it's like a
53:27 leather flavor I don't know hay flavor
53:29 and I ask you again two years later
53:33 you're gonna be like I got a bean and
53:35 got a little bit of a flower a floral
53:37 thing at the end it had three
53:38 transitions but but you're you're
53:40 getting more educated about your ability
53:42 to discern what was happening because
53:44 your brain can slow it down and it's had
53:46 a lot of experience over time there is a
53:49 reason for my young listeners if you're
53:51 under 25 this should be an exciting
53:54 statement and not a belittling statement
53:56 so please don't take it the wrong way
53:58 when you're younger you'll hear older
54:01 people like me and other folks say you
54:03 know before 25 you really don't know
54:06 anything about the world on average some
54:08 of you kids are way ahead of your time
54:11 but what we're trying to tell you is
54:14 that no matter how quickly you're
54:16 growing no matter how this you know
54:18 amazing you are when you are our age
54:22 double your age let's just say you're 20
54:25 you're gonna be 40 what you personally
54:28 will know at 40 unless you take a bunch
54:30 of drugs and blow out your brain with
54:32 drugs you will recognize I don't know
54:37 two three four times as much stuff with
54:40 every tiny little experience that you
54:41 have and life becomes a lot more
54:43 interesting the more that you start
54:45 parsing and slowing down time that's the
54:47 one of the formulas I use on this show
54:49 is to slow down your brain and take in
54:51 all the little atoms of little thoughts
54:53 that you've had so that you're having on
54:55 a particular situation I believe that
54:58 when we look at this world and really
55:00 look at it and I don't mean a skyscraper
55:03 that man built I mean your favorite
55:07 insect your favorite animal those of you
55:09 who are animal lovers my god you know
55:11 when you look in the face of an animal
55:13 you are getting way more than just the
55:17 the virus that makes you love the animal
55:20 you know there's this virus we found in
55:21 cats I'm sure it exists in dogs and all
55:23 kinds of stuff but there's a three
55:26 dimensional life force looking back at
55:28 you that gives you love and
55:30 consideration
55:31 that turns the shoulder on your own some
55:33 well when it's like you didn't give me
55:34 enough food you won't give me your your
55:37 chicken leg will then screw you for an
55:39 hour so right very human-like in a lot
55:42 of cases
55:42 well this familiarity could be explained
55:45 in a couple different ways the kind of
55:49 lowbrow version of it which could
55:50 definitely be they both could be true is
55:54 reincarnation you've been here before
55:58 I've said this a couple times on the
56:00 show when I eat Indian food I have this
56:04 amazing Luke I'm your father moment
56:06 right or no I'm your father moment and I
56:09 feel like I get these sort of cloudy
56:13 visions of having lived over there and
56:16 having been an Indian now to Nate it not
56:20 a Native American but an in India Indian
56:22 right I don't know why and it's usually
56:25 only the first few bites it's like the
56:27 first I'm gonna eat my papa Dom you know
56:30 a little thin crusty bread man it just
56:33 hits me when I eat oregano out of
56:36 Italian food man I get this weird
56:38 flashback it's a strange feeling that
56:42 could be because I've been over there or
56:44 it could be that we're all corner sort
56:47 of like that Hitchhiker's Guide to the
56:49 galaxy dudes slot II bought Faust who
56:50 who designs planets you know he does
56:53 coastlines you want an award once right
56:56 so if we designed the universe and
57:00 participate in the design of the
57:02 universe well that could explain a few
57:04 things it could explain our preferences
57:08 our soul preferences at any stage of the
57:12 game well we helped design that so
57:16 either maybe we're more interested in
57:18 that because we design that or maybe
57:20 we're not as interested in that because
57:21 we know everything about that and we're
57:23 interested in the stuff that we don't
57:24 know a lot of people are people that are
57:28 you know they're they're only surround
57:31 themselves with things that are familiar
57:33 they hang onto objects from their
57:35 childhood to stay familiar because it
57:37 makes them feel comfortable and other
57:39 folks want to ditch everything as fast
57:42 as they possibly can experience in new
57:43 things
57:44 you know I am more of the latter example
57:47 I do have my little things from my past
57:49 but I I really like to experience new
57:51 life you know so what does this mean on
57:54 a daily basis right well we know life
57:59 goes on regardless if anyone understands
58:02 this kind of stuff or believes this kind
58:04 of stuff right it seems like the
58:05 universe has been going for a while you
58:08 know I don't know if anyone has really
58:11 postulated this in the profound public
58:13 way Shirley MacLaine in the late 80s
58:17 early 90s
58:18 Warren Beatty's sister older sister she
58:22 came up with this sort of new-age belief
58:24 system that we do reincarnate and that
58:29 we choose our path before we reincarnate
58:34 we choose what time were born what
58:36 creature were going to be born into what
58:38 location in the universe that were born
58:41 and then we sort of the theory splits up
58:45 at that point I I think her assertion
58:49 was that you choose to either be you
58:53 choose either your entire path which I
58:55 think is what she was trying to assert
58:56 in her belief system or you choose the
59:01 kind of guiding principles and location
59:04 of where you are and then it's roll the
59:05 dice let's get in there and have some
59:07 fun it's very interesting but the
59:11 annoying part about her well I should
59:14 say this the annoying part about the
59:16 first example if that's what she
59:18 believes but sheet I'm not gonna tire to
59:19 it that you choose all the things that
59:21 happen to you I mean like the whole
59:22 thing is determined by you is that her
59:25 thing was if you're poor then be poor
59:28 because you chose to be poor and I have
59:31 I take umbrage with that right if you
59:36 wanted to experience the Bliss of
59:37 becoming wealthy I guess you would
59:39 probably have to start off not being
59:41 wealthy because how would you know the
59:43 benefits of being wealthy if you hadn't
59:45 been poor how many amazing people in
59:48 this world started out utterly penniless
59:50 and through some talent through some
59:52 creativity gained wealth and then in
59:55 most cases regretted it in some cases
59:57 right
59:58 what piece do you get on a daily basis
60:00 if you were to assume for one second
60:03 that either there are as many souls that
60:05 participate in the creation of the
60:06 universe or there's only one there's an
60:10 interesting benefit the first level of
60:13 the plural version of this theory is
60:15 that well you are actually a lot more
60:20 integral in everything that's going on
60:23 and I guess I guess the kind of sidecar
60:26 idea is reincarnation don't worry about
60:28 dying hey don't try to just be flippant
60:32 about dying don't put your kids in
60:33 danger cuz you're like I have a dino
60:35 problem right nobody does that but the
60:38 idea is you might be at more peace with
60:40 the universe if you simply go well this
60:43 is how it has to be I just never knew
60:46 before I never really thought about
60:48 living forever never forgetting anything
60:51 and turning into a queue that tries to
60:52 commit suicide like the episode on
60:54 Voyager Star Trek but now this is a bit
60:57 of a repeat from one of my episodes but
61:00 if you are the only living being which
61:06 I'm not convinced to that but if we were
61:09 the only thing you and I are the same
61:11 being
61:12 I'm living to different timetables you
61:14 or me and I am you isn't interesting we
61:17 be the other evil people in the world -
61:19 yikes but I would say go down that path
61:25 for one reason and it's to contemplate
61:29 for one second that you hating someone
61:36 else as you hating yourself you
61:42 betraying someone is you betraying
61:45 yourself and isn't it interesting ok
61:50 this is what's so unbelievably right in
61:54 our face about this whole argument is
61:56 that do any of us really feel happy when
62:00 we are mean to someone else I mean you
62:04 might get something off your chest but
62:07 after a while you're kind of like Jesus
62:09 I was really an [ __ ] and I got super
62:11 emotional
62:12 and you regret it on some level it's
62:16 really funny gun owners are really funny
62:17 you know I'm a gun owner anyone who's
62:20 ever had to use a weapon to protect
62:22 themselves
62:23 strictly self-defense and they actually
62:25 pull the pull the trigger and kill
62:27 another human being very few people live
62:31 a full rich life after doing that
62:35 without having a little bit of gnawing
62:37 sensation that something was really
62:40 wrong about having to do that and it
62:43 could be you know some nuts coming at
62:45 you with his gun and you have to do it
62:46 it's either you were him
62:47 but even if you kill him in that
62:49 scenario there's a part of you that dies
62:53 but what if he is you you lied against
62:57 yourself you betrayed yourself and
62:59 that's why I think it feels bad to the
63:02 self and then the happy part of the side
63:07 is that when you learn how to give
63:09 instead of take all the time when you
63:13 become less entitled and you become more
63:15 of a giving soul you know we've got to
63:16 regulate all that because you can be
63:18 taken advantage of obviously you feel
63:21 amazing you feel wonderful you have
63:25 talked about in the show a couple of
63:26 times I've you know in the last couple
63:32 of years right I've given a homeless
63:33 person some money that was just sitting
63:37 at a restaurant that one day really hit
63:41 me I think last was this dude old guy
63:44 sitting in the Arby's here in Huntington
63:48 Beach only have one now cuz the other
63:50 one burned down right after they
63:52 remodeled it made it amazing it burned
63:53 to the ground son of a [ __ ] the other
63:56 ones real tiny it's one of the classic
63:58 ones that's why it's such a bummer but
64:02 this dude was there and he was probably
64:05 in his 60s I think and he was sitting in
64:08 that restaurant kind of mumbling to
64:10 himself a little bit asked for a cup for
64:13 water and then he kind of tried to get
64:15 some soda and he just looked like he was
64:18 so hungry he was out of his mind a
64:20 little bit but he's still keeping it
64:21 together and I knew that if I gave money
64:25 while I was eating
64:26 he was gonna maybe say thank you so much
64:28 that I maybe make a show or something
64:31 that I didn't want have that happened to
64:32 me so I quickly finished my meal and it
64:35 just so happened to have cash I don't
64:36 always have cash on me I don't know how
64:38 much money I had probably six bucks or
64:40 something like that and I just took all
64:44 the money I had and I put it on the
64:47 table right in front of him I said get
64:49 yourself something to eat you know and I
64:52 just immediately left and just in a
64:54 couple steps that I was leaving this guy
64:56 starts crying and say thank you you know
64:59 it was just one of those moments when it
65:02 made a big difference and it wasn't
65:03 gonna go into anything strange right I
65:05 think a lot of that's you know going to
65:08 buy booze and drugs
65:09 I think that's yesteryear so almost
65:11 people I think a lot of folks to pay
65:12 bills with it but we have to regularly
65:15 how much we create homeless people by by
65:17 these scam artists right but there's
65:21 this weird thing that happens and if
65:24 he's me and I'm starving then I help
65:28 myself and one way or another right
65:32 there was a little anecdote side thing
65:35 to that and just understanding that
65:37 guy's mindset when I first came to
65:40 California I'm all by myself I spent my
65:44 money I think I actually landed in
65:47 California with $130 but me back a
65:50 hundred bucks in my pocket and that went
65:52 really quick right trying to eat and
65:53 stuff but there was within a couple
65:55 weeks or three weeks or first month or
65:57 whatever I got down to the point where I
65:58 had I think a dollar it's all I had
66:02 my car had some gas because I worked at
66:04 a race car place I was able to get gas
66:05 through their back pump but McDonald's
66:09 of all places had a Big Mac one dollar
66:13 special thing I was like ninety nine
66:14 cents and I think it was a buck five and
66:18 I literally had to scrounge in my car
66:19 for the five cents to cover the Sam
66:21 burger and you know Big Macs are pretty
66:22 good size things and I remember buying
66:26 that McDonald's Big Mac and when I ate
66:29 it it was a religious experience because
66:30 I was so famished and so hungry and I
66:34 was I was able to get lunch from work
66:36 because they would buy us Greek food
66:38 a gym while racing and so anyway I you
66:43 know when I you hold those things over
66:46 those little moments in your own life so
66:47 you can kind of empathetically put
66:49 yourself in other people's shoes right
66:51 it's a tough thing to contemplate that
66:55 you would ever want yourself to go
67:00 through a really tough experience it's a
67:04 tough one you know people who have had
67:07 you know tough life their whole life and
67:12 it never got any better and it ended and
67:15 it's usually not first world country
67:17 people but it does happen every once in
67:18 a while in first world countries right
67:19 just bad parents bad situations and then
67:23 it never got any better and they died
67:26 away ahead of their time
67:27 whether they be 40 50 60 or 16 we want
67:33 them to not have those lives potentially
67:35 because we subconsciously know it's us
67:38 whether it be it's us as the creators of
67:41 the universe or us as in there's only
67:44 one of us but those who look down on us
67:48 right if you use the old Greek theater
67:50 Greek God model right there's a Coliseum
67:52 and we're all down there like you know
67:54 was The Clash of the Titans in the movie
67:55 right that recreated this old lore you
67:59 know they're down there moving us around
68:00 like pawns in a game they're not worried
68:04 about what we believe or whether or not
68:05 they're hurting us because whoever's
68:08 running the show on the outside you know
68:10 West world's a good example of this
68:12 people take the train in they're
68:14 surrendering the control of the universe
68:16 to the narrator's right Anthony Hopkins
68:18 character and they have this sort of
68:22 understanding that the the hosts can't
68:25 shoot them and somehow there's
68:27 regulations against you know patrons
68:29 shooting each other that's a much more
68:32 controlled entertainment format of the
68:34 same exact thing I think that the other
68:38 flip side to this is that this life is
68:41 meant to be a challenge it becomes an
68:43 instant game if you're floating around
68:45 in the universe with all the rest of us
68:47 or there's only us my god you know again
68:49 I'm I'm probably going to just startling
68:51 fact that it I am more of a plural hive
68:56 format of we are God we participating
69:01 created this thing there has to be a
69:03 veil that protects us from knowing how
69:06 this thing works because then it would
69:08 break the entire illusion why doesn't a
69:12 God come down and prove himself to us
69:15 well how would that work how would that
69:20 work if a guy came down and proved
69:22 himself a guarantee you would lose all
69:24 choice in your life and unless God in
69:28 his one visit to you was just used that
69:30 he if he didn't drop off the manual for
69:34 what is considered right and wrong
69:36 during his visit you would live in
69:39 perpetual terror that you now believe in
69:43 a god and again unless he tells you
69:45 what's right or wrong or what the
69:46 consequences are right or wrong you
69:50 might do something wrong you might say
69:52 the wrong thing you might touch your
69:53 wife in the wrong way and then all of a
69:55 sudden you've committed some blasphemous
69:59 sin but you don't know because you don't
70:01 know but you do know that there's a God
70:04 now so you just have enough information
70:06 to scare the crap out of yourself right
70:09 this theory will definitely mold your
70:13 thoughts a little bit if you can dig
70:15 into it and I know that a lot of you
70:17 have already dug into this I just know
70:18 you have right
70:20 again it's not a paradigm of
70:23 understanding that takes away all the
70:25 pain all the sadness of things that go
70:28 wrong according to our right and wrong
70:31 model here but just remember this you
70:34 know good and bad I've talked about it
70:38 several times on the show especially in
70:40 my I believe it's good and evil episode
70:42 and maybe even the evil of us evil
70:45 episode the idea is if there was a
70:47 natural disaster some big earthquake in
70:50 San Francisco a big one like 1905 and a
70:54 bunch of stuff falls down a bunch of
70:56 people perish in that disaster the
71:00 bigger the disaster this is a weird
71:03 reality of the equation
71:05 the bigger the disaster the more
71:08 emergency people that have to respond to
71:11 clean it up and help people I think that
71:14 there might be a reality that more
71:17 positive things happen as a result of
71:20 that disaster what am I talking about
71:22 well the patient that meets the nurse
71:26 let it be male female female male male
71:29 female female whatever they meet each
71:32 other for the very first time and they
71:34 become engaged married have a whole
71:37 family they didn't know each other until
71:39 the disaster occurred police officers
71:42 saved somebody and some relationship
71:44 happens there he becomes the step uncle
71:46 to all these kids that he saved or she
71:50 saved right the reason why I mentioned
71:53 that little thing at the end of this
71:54 episode is that our belief system of God
71:59 is usually trying to create some
72:01 paradigm of comfort for that which is
72:03 unexplained and I think man has been we
72:10 have no idea how smart man what was back
72:12 in the days of say the the pyramids
72:15 other than reading hieroglyphs many of
72:18 which have been destroyed over the years
72:19 but we haven't been that existential in
72:23 mass population we still have never been
72:26 that way there's not a ton of people who
72:30 really push through this and think about
72:32 it and give it a chance in their mind
72:34 but when you do when you have the guts
72:36 to reach out and and push your brain in
72:39 these thoughts and go you know what I'm
72:41 gonna stop saying that God works in
72:42 mysterious ways and I'm gonna start
72:44 thinking about how this could possibly
72:47 exist how could a a child suffer a
72:51 disease as Stephen Fry is lamented the
72:54 reason why he can't believe in a God why
72:57 take everything that he says there's
72:59 that there's a video look up Stephen Fry
73:00 he gets fr ye again he's he's a big
73:04 British comedian he's much older now I
73:07 used to watch him in Jeeves and Wooster
73:09 back in the day take all the things
73:12 you've ever heard from an atheist about
73:14 why they don't believe in God and try to
73:15 decipher it within this model and I
73:17 think you'll find that
73:18 all the sudden all their concerns and
73:21 paradigms completely vanish
73:23 they just didn't think outside the box
73:25 long enough to come up with an option we
73:29 are stuck living we are either we're
73:33 stuck living in this human body or we're
73:34 stuck living as a soul and so I don't
73:37 fear a lot of knowledge problems when
73:40 you pass away I feel like you absolutely
73:42 plug back into the database of the
73:43 universe you have the Google of the
73:45 universe available to you to search but
73:48 when you get in these limited paradigms
73:50 of humanity almost sabian sapien this
73:52 life force that we're entertaining right
73:55 now we don't have all that access and as
73:58 much as that frustrates those of us
73:59 looking for the truth yeah you know
74:03 maybe we have found a lot more truth
74:05 than we think nothing will change the
74:08 fact that we are amazing creatures I
74:11 mean if you really stop to think about
74:13 the biological reality of the human body
74:16 and how much incredibly unique mass and
74:21 an invention that's gone on to keep us
74:24 alive second to second all the immune
74:26 system stuff that works how every bodily
74:29 organ works how your brain works through
74:33 your pituitary gland your pineal gland
74:35 all your glands right your chakras that
74:39 connect with your soul and then connect
74:42 with the universe the fact that your gut
74:44 gives you an instinct about what's right
74:46 or wrong and usually every single time
74:47 you go against your gut you are
74:50 compromising your reality right and the
74:53 only real question at the end of this
74:55 whole story that starts to plague some
74:59 of us is why is our lifespan so short if
75:06 we came from an infinite life force that
75:10 lives forever then why why is it that
75:14 the human body really only lasts about a
75:17 hundred years in the most incredible
75:19 conditions right I've got two relatives
75:22 just a couple degrees
75:25 they lived to be 101 and his father
75:27 lived to be 104 you know with two
75:31 generations they went 205 years all
75:34 right but that's about it that's all you
75:36 get in those last 10 years your eyeballs
75:38 start turning brown and it's just like a
75:40 weird existence up at that level right
75:43 you sort of kind of need to leave
75:44 because you need to kind of rejuvenate
75:46 the old vessel why a hundred years
75:50 that's the question I can't answer and
75:53 the more you become really engaged with
75:56 life and the reason why I'm telling you
75:58 guys of that question is that I feel
76:01 like you are the exact population
76:04 segment that really thinks about that
76:06 question from time to time or if you
76:08 have opposed to you're like oh yeah
76:10 that's weird because you're interested
76:12 in the truth you're interested in
76:13 deciphering everything you don't agree
76:14 with me a hundred percent but you're out
76:16 there trying to find your own truth and
76:20 it takes years then there's the biology
76:23 of when we procreate
76:24 as soon as a girl menstruates you can
76:27 make babies but it'd be seven years old
76:29 or 15 years old she can have a kid back
76:33 in the day they used to have kids on
76:35 kids and you know before they were 18
76:36 there was no you know well there's been
76:40 errors where old men were married off to
76:42 teenagers but you're essentially if you
76:45 think we go classic fifteen-year-old
76:47 starts having kids a couple hundred
76:49 years ago even 150 years ago that was
76:52 pretty common well then you might have
76:57 four generations on average that you get
76:59 to meet right you have your kids they
77:01 have their kids and then their kids ever
77:03 you have great-grandchildren because you
77:06 had it and so early and you're gonna
77:07 live to be 80 to 100 years old because
77:09 you're not eating a bunch of crappy
77:10 toxin food we don't have radio
77:12 frequencies jamming in the body creating
77:14 leukemia with you know billions of Hertz
77:17 of wave energy moving through your body
77:20 right it's an ecosystem and we know a
77:23 lot about the ecosystem that we're stuck
77:25 in now we just need to decipher it and
77:28 model it against some form of life using
77:31 some basic rules about the fact that you
77:33 can't hide energy in the universe
77:35 I know you feel me we want to do this
77:38 episode for a while and I thought it
77:42 would time to kind of summarize a bunch
77:44 of the other episodes and tie it all
77:45 together
77:46 if you dig this episode the other
77:47 episode you're gonna like are creating
77:50 the universe and probably the
77:56 reincarnation episode the existential
77:58 existentialism episode as well and maybe
78:01 the Gnostic episode so you know I'm
78:04 supposed to go and annotate all these
78:06 videos and put links up and say okay
78:07 soon as I say that you know is the link
78:09 that goes across the top unfortunate I
78:12 don't have that much time I already
