00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:34 welcome ladies and gentlemen back to
00:36 deep thoughts all right so you can see
00:41 the title some of you might think that's
00:44 one of those trivial topics that we all
00:47 know about so funny when I film a night
00:50 and there's like shadows at the
00:52 background which you can't see after the
00:53 filter applies I always feel like I'm on
00:55 some fake moon hoax said right it's so
01:00 obviously not real
01:02 so obviously this episode is going to be
01:06 about the fact that the news the
01:10 information that we get that tells us
01:12 what's going on in the world outside of
01:14 our own spectrum of view our own sensory
01:18 input is private for-profit in most
01:25 cases right move around the world and
01:27 it's a little bit different I'm gonna
01:28 come almost purely from an American
01:30 standpoint because that's all I know
01:32 about them I know that the BBC is
01:38 largely controlled by their state they
01:40 receive state money but in America it is
01:45 what was traditionally called yellow
01:47 journalism you know yellow journalism
01:49 yellow journalism try to say that a
01:51 bunch of times fast red leather yellow
01:54 leather
01:55 so how let's just rewind a little bit
01:58 here before we get into the obvious
01:59 because here's my thing if anybody wants
02:03 to watch the first two minutes of this
02:04 and go a [ __ ] man I've seen this kind of
02:06 I've heard this argument before it's
02:08 true yeah big deal blah blah blah
02:10 we all know this then my rebuttal would
02:14 be well we're not talking about it that
02:17 much calling the news fake news is
02:20 definitely an upgrade in the vernacular
02:22 of mankind but to understand its
02:25 mechanisms is way more important than
02:29 just calling it fake it's sort of like
02:32 calling someone who hurts animals and
02:35 rapes people a dodo bird you know he's
02:39 the dodo bird yeah he sure is now why is
02:42 he a dodo bird
02:43 I haven't thought that far half a chess
02:46 move half
02:47 just move okay how important is your
02:54 reality how important is it that when
02:57 you wake up that what you see in what
02:59 you hear what your tastes feel all these
03:01 things be accurate within the spectrum
03:05 of your existence I'm gonna tell you
03:10 mine is as priceless as priceless could
03:13 possibly be I want to know what is
03:20 what's real
03:22 why are you a truther if you're a
03:26 truther there's something very very
03:28 important that needs to be acknowledged
03:31 you have a well I'll put it this way
03:33 depending on how long you've been a
03:35 truther but if I even gave you one year
03:38 most of you are like 10 15 20 or
03:41 truthers maybe even further you have
03:45 battle wounds you have relationships
03:48 that have gone south friendships of
03:50 acquaintances you have family members
03:52 won't talk to you anymore
03:54 because they think you're crazy and
03:55 that's how they find their superiority
03:58 is to again research nothing know
04:00 everything that is their mantra a coward
04:04 by any other definition so if you're
04:09 gonna pay this price and be this truther
04:11 which I'm very glad you are then we need
04:15 to purify the water supply right and
04:18 part of that is to understand the enemy
04:22 let's say you're a hardcore truther okay
04:25 how do you find out what's going on in
04:28 Somalia Ethiopia Vietnam Russia Yemen
04:36 how do you find out what's going on in
04:39 those places unless you say it's all
04:40 those places South America right
04:43 Venezuela Brazil Argentina Chile you
04:49 would need personal correspondences in
04:52 each one of those areas of the world
04:54 wouldn't you otherwise you're gonna have
04:56 to rely on some hearsay and as long as
04:59 the ap Reuters Roth
05:01 child pay sewer control apparatus has
05:04 access to that information it is going
05:06 to get changed its going to get deleted
05:08 it's going to get filtered and maybe
05:10 maybe maybe maybe you have a remote clue
05:15 what the [ __ ] is going on but then again
05:17 what do you need to know hmm
05:21 we've convinced ourselves that were
05:23 globalists on one level that we need to
05:25 know everything that's going on we need
05:27 to [ __ ] fight everybody's [ __ ] war
05:29 all around the world hmm it'd be nice if
05:32 we had that many resources and that much
05:34 time on our hands but in the end when
05:36 the bill comes to pay your mortgage your
05:39 car payments your insurance your kids
05:41 college the electricity your Netflix
05:45 bill does anyone give a [ __ ] if you say
05:47 well you know guys I'm gonna need a bit
05:48 of an extension on that well why is that
05:50 because I'm travelling the world to
05:51 figure out what's happening and all
05:52 these are the locations of which I have
05:54 nothing to do with now let's say that
05:56 you fled from your country Venezuela you
05:59 fled from Venezuela and so you do know
06:02 people on the ground in Venezuela it is
06:04 something that's important to you and
06:05 you want to rescue more people you
06:07 actually want to fix your country but
06:08 you know you had to leave temporarily to
06:11 get your wits together slightly
06:14 different situation
06:15 and you have people you can probably
06:17 correspond with through Skype or we chat
06:21 or phone call or whatever to figure out
06:23 what's going on you could even talk in a
06:25 loose code to make sure that no one gets
06:27 arrested in the middle of the night for
06:28 being a dissenter but now before we get
06:31 to the news organizations that our
06:33 profit-based are there any profit based
06:37 organizations on this planet that you
06:40 trust and that you could trust past the
06:44 day that the founder dies I'm gonna say
06:48 no once the founder dies and the founder
06:52 is still probably I don't know what the
06:54 odds are but I'd say at at best a 50/50
06:57 roll of the die that you're going to get
07:00 an ethical company like I said I thought
07:05 Steve Jobs was great got a chance to get
07:07 in his circle for a few years but in the
07:09 end I didn't agree with his monopoly
07:13 ecosystem
07:15 where you can't sell an iTunes app
07:17 outside of iTunes you know I didn't I
07:22 don't like the fact that they purposely
07:24 slow down my computers so that I have to
07:25 buy a new one that all happened on his
07:27 watch so he's not perfect but overall he
07:30 was an innovator he brought us the
07:32 future it's cool a lot of people like
07:35 dad a lot of females a lot of males all
07:37 around the world that are like that but
07:39 as soon as they passed away
07:41 things change Sam Walton died
07:44 I believe in 1988 he used to come to my
07:46 little store in Kansas where I used to
07:48 work soon as he died they took the
07:50 company over pull the u.s. star off the
07:52 logo but the Illuminati star on there
07:54 people have a completely [ __ ]
07:56 misunderstood but all the profits go to
07:59 European banking cartel people and the
08:02 manufacturing profits go to China and
08:04 India but it's always misconstrued as
08:07 well profits go to China
08:09 no dude they go to a bunch of dudes who
08:12 control the planet and they're using it
08:14 as a weapon and Charlotte is Ruby said
08:16 that started in 1973 the dummy
08:19 deliberate dumbing down of America but
08:21 one of their biggest biggest plans was
08:23 to put a multinational corporation in
08:26 every little hometown to suck it dry and
08:29 suck a dry for long enough there three
08:31 generations go by and no one knows how
08:34 to start a grocery store a clothing
08:38 store right and so when they pull out
08:42 it's going to be the sound of you know a
08:47 big car crash of suffering which is why
08:51 we have to dig out the schematics of how
08:53 to be Americans again and wherever you
08:55 are but you can't trust profit based
08:59 corporations because if you ever get
09:01 into profit that well if you ever get
09:03 into the formation of a corporation
09:05 there's absolutely nothing and the
09:08 corporate educational classes you can
09:11 take in college you take a business
09:13 degree this has anything about empathy
09:17 and the well-being of men it is a
09:20 straight myopic thing for really
09:23 degenerate left brain people to say the
09:26 corporation the corporation the
09:28 corporation of coke
09:29 if people suffer any man it's just like
09:32 [ __ ] Beezus right amazon.com
09:35 amazon.com is the only company that has
09:39 been able to out scumbag Walmart you
09:42 know but if Richard Branson a virgin
09:48 cares about his employees he's on the
09:50 front of every goddamn magazine on
09:52 planet Earth
09:53 I used to subscribe to entrepreneurial
09:55 magazine when I was a kid and money
09:57 magazine and I noticed that every single
10:01 cover article was about someone that ran
10:04 a corporation was nice to their
10:06 employees and then they were amazing to
10:08 the corporation and boom they had great
10:12 products I've worked for companies that
10:15 took care of their employees and man
10:17 when they did you know Electronic Arts
10:19 during the 90s 80s and 90s at least for
10:22 at least two-thirds of the 90s had
10:25 beautiful bonus checks for the for the
10:28 employees Blizzard Entertainment used to
10:30 have bonus checks for the employees and
10:32 as soon as they pull those bonus checks
10:34 and [ __ ] everybody like nobody's
10:36 noticing right they immediately go from
10:39 number one to number two their products
10:42 start to suck the employees start to
10:43 leave for startups that they create on
10:45 their own to then immediately come back
10:47 and compete with their previous employer
10:50 Blizzard is being utterly gutted right
10:52 now gutted Activision's being gutted
10:55 this morning they reported that Bungie
10:57 pulled destiny out of Activision
11:00 distribution rights ooh big changes big
11:05 changes right so um let's review the
11:10 corporation's only obligation is itself
11:14 there's no point when a corporation sits
11:18 down at a table and says well we have to
11:20 treat our employees right yes yes we do
11:23 do they write that down that never
11:25 happens with a normal corporation it's
11:29 how do we get profits up weenie how do
11:32 we reduce costs how do we compromise the
11:34 quality of the product that we have
11:36 because it's money money money money
11:37 money because the guys in charge right
11:40 it's so funny you get these
11:42 Tim Cook who's just a funny social
11:45 justice warrior makes 300 times more
11:47 than the average employee at Apple 300
11:52 times more and he's crying a [ __ ]
11:55 river about socialism and you know just
12:01 equality right isn't that [ __ ]
12:03 hilarious well I want equality if I'm
12:05 gay but when it comes to my salary you
12:10 know the guy doesn't I mean I'm sure he
12:11 works harder than the average employee
12:13 but not harder than a lot of these
12:14 employees that are coming in weekends
12:16 making [ __ ] up and inventing things
12:17 which he doesn't do right and he's no
12:21 different than a bunch of these guys
12:22 right okay no what is the news how does
12:29 it work
12:30 when you buy an iPad well you like what
12:33 it does you like the applications that
12:34 run on it you like its form factor you
12:37 have a brand loyalty perhaps certainly
12:39 better than all the other tablets that
12:40 exist on planet earth that I've seen and
12:43 so you scrimp and you save and you go
12:46 out and get that thing that's pretty
12:49 easy that's a product based business
12:52 what other kind of businesses do you
12:54 have you have service based businesses
12:55 well plumber comes out and does
12:57 something to your plumbing he plumbs you
13:00 well and it's great and you eat the
13:02 embrasure salad smoke a cigar and go
13:05 home something you're gonna get all
13:08 these references and you're gonna have
13:09 such a good time in this show but news
13:13 feeds you what
13:15 well media perception they are engaging
13:23 your full sensory input on today's basis
13:28 just as Marshall McLuhan the Canadian
13:30 based philosopher who I believe moved to
13:32 United States and taught here before he
13:34 concluded his life his arch nemesis was
13:38 Jean bozo log there's another genius
13:42 he's a Frenchman so why do we consume
13:47 the news so [ __ ] much I mean
13:50 seriously why do we I do it Jesus right
13:53 like I consumed it a little bit
13:55 different than I think
13:56 the people around me probably very
13:57 similar to the way you ingest it which
13:59 is know thy enemy you got a look when
14:03 they're pumping narratives narratives
14:05 are amazing because it's predictive
14:07 programming they're trying to tell you
14:08 what's going to occur or at least what
14:10 they wish would occur all these you know
14:13 true through [ __ ] channels on YouTube
14:15 predicting all of these economic
14:16 collapses again pawning off you know day
14:21 trading [ __ ] courses and stuff I
14:24 mean seriously
14:25 don't fall for any of that [ __ ] okay if
14:28 you want to hedge your bets and
14:30 diversify your portfolio you have some
14:33 cash in a safe and you got some silver
14:36 and gold ingots that you possess you go
14:39 buy Swiss francs which are little tiny
14:41 things about the size between a diamond
14:43 and nickel and it's the purest gold on
14:46 planet earth because Swiss gold
14:48 standards are the highest put them in a
14:51 safety deposit box put them in a big
14:53 safe somewhere keep it safe but if you
14:55 can't hold it and you can't touch it
14:56 anymore [ __ ] okay but the news the news
15:00 is there to rub you to rub you in a way
15:05 that makes you have a reaction it's sort
15:09 of like the alien consciousness episode
15:11 are just released it's there to
15:13 stimulate you and get you vested in
15:15 itself you know they'll tell you that if
15:19 you live in Los Angeles like they know
15:20 there's a lot of people Los Angeles and
15:22 New York and San Francisco and various
15:24 places around the United States and so
15:26 they will run articles that engage you
15:29 to make you believe that in your area
15:30 there's a big problem and boy you better
15:32 pay attention or otherwise it's not
15:33 going to resolve itself in the end it
15:35 usually resolves itself and in the end
15:37 it usually doesn't have anything to do
15:38 with your participation but maybe you
15:41 didn't sleep as well because they put
15:43 that little riff in your brain how do
15:46 they make money well there's really two
15:50 main arteries for any major news network
15:53 which is they have a television channel
15:54 and they sell advertising between their
15:58 sanctioned you know rationed [ __ ]
16:02 news the whole thing when I was a kid
16:05 about news at 11:00 right they would say
16:07 this horrible goddamn thing needs
16:10 like meteor expected to hit your town at
16:13 10 o'clock news at 11 you know and so
16:15 you you know if it's something that's
16:18 [ __ ] important and it's dangerous for
16:20 mankind there's a rapist on the loose
16:21 news at 11 it's like okay it's [ __ ] 3
16:24 p.m. in the afternoon why don't you tell
16:25 me where this [ __ ] rapist is so I
16:27 don't get raped between 3 and 11 you
16:29 [ __ ] right but they know that the 11
16:33 o'clock story is all [ __ ] it's just
16:35 there's a bunch of bait right how do
16:40 they make money on the web on the web
16:42 they got you just inundated with
16:44 advertising the amount of advertising
16:46 you get on the web is probably 20 times
16:48 more intense than you get on television
16:51 what was their dreaded platform has
16:55 become the preferred platform what's the
16:58 next step down next step down is
16:59 newspapers why anyone [ __ ] reads a
17:03 newspaper I don't get it I mean you must
17:06 have a metal plate in your head and
17:07 you've got a [ __ ] omaha beach
17:09 invasion badge or metal on your on your
17:12 lapel or something right because it is
17:15 the most arcane way to get information a
17:18 day late well I get it a day late why
17:20 get your propaganda a day late right but
17:25 again that's advertising stuck between
17:27 the pages at least you get a comic
17:29 section right what's the next step down
17:32 the next step down is magazines ooh
17:35 magazines have interesting shiny pages
17:39 that are bound they're actually
17:41 collectible you could put them in a box
17:43 if you wanted to then all of this comes
17:46 with the brand loyalty doesn't it when I
17:49 was a kid I got my first TV at 15 years
17:51 old when I was in my bedroom I had a TV
17:54 out front of course with the family my
17:56 dad got me this TV and I remember CNN
17:58 online news headline news just hit the
18:03 airwaves 84 85 somewhere in there at
18:05 least in my hometown and so I would sit
18:08 there in program with that [ __ ] on 24/7
18:11 thinking man I'm really keeping informed
18:13 write 14 or 15 years old I had
18:16 absolutely no mechanical concept of
18:19 propaganda I heard about yellow
18:23 journalism
18:24 but you know that was yesterday yellow
18:26 journalism was fixed right just took
18:29 Woodrow Wilson using a [ __ ] ton of it to
18:31 get the the sixteenth Amendment started
18:34 so we could [ __ ] ourselves over for all
18:35 of our money being fiat in the IRS
18:37 coming after us with you know dogs but I
18:42 built up a brand loyalty for seeing it
18:45 you know this is pre 9/11 this is the
18:47 middle of the the booming 80s our
18:50 culture was off the charts in America we
18:53 weren't thinking on a global level we
18:55 didn't have the internet so okay yeah
18:57 it's cool man and finding out what's
18:58 going on mostly trivial stuff and what's
19:02 really funny as trivia still trivial
19:04 things still sell to this day they just
19:06 they have a much deeper objective going
19:10 on and I believe I still have the
19:12 episode trauma journalism out there you
19:15 should probably see that next but what
19:18 is it now any any news organization that
19:22 you go to it's a little bit less on the
19:25 printed news because they know that
19:27 there's no flashbang effect when you
19:31 read a newspaper on average right I mean
19:33 it might be a major headline if some
19:35 SuperDuper event happens if Russia
19:37 declared war on China you know it's
19:40 gonna be on the front page of the
19:41 newspaper but save some catastrophic
19:44 event like that there's usually you know
19:47 average [ __ ] on the front of a
19:49 newspaper but when you're live you're
19:52 live on television you're liable on the
19:54 internet man you can accomplish all
19:55 kinds of stuff can't you hmm
19:58 now let's talk about what they do and
20:01 then we'll get into the loop back to
20:03 this profit mechanism they love on live
20:07 news any live news format and again all
20:10 the newspapers and magazines usually
20:11 have their own websites that correspond
20:13 with that so they're actually able to to
20:15 gather live data they all have their
20:16 [ __ ] Twitter accounts and all the
20:18 other [ __ ] Instagram mostly Twitter
20:21 Twitter is where you get to pretend like
20:23 you're an adult and so much fun but
20:26 let's just say there's another parkland
20:28 shooting well any normal human being
20:33 with a moral fiber is horrified when
20:36 these things occur
20:37 be they real be they orchestrated be
20:39 they completely fake it doesn't matter
20:41 when those kind of things occur the
20:44 society that you're a part of that I'm a
20:45 part of that we want to expand on should
20:50 be horrified alright but you know what
20:55 happens inside these private for-profit
20:57 news organizations they have the
21:01 equivalent of the sloppiest orgasm you
21:04 could possibly describe with words as
21:06 soon as there's a parkland shooting kind
21:09 of thing the profit margin if they had a
21:13 ticker like you know the ticker that's
21:15 the the supposedly national debt ticker
21:17 if you had the profit ticker and the
21:19 rate of change in a different ticker
21:21 right they get double triple and
21:27 quadruple the money the second that one
21:30 of these horrific events occurs hmm a
21:38 lot of people wonder why the news
21:40 organizations go along with these false
21:47 events let's split that way I'm trying
21:49 to keep the key words out of the text
21:51 transcription text so this thing doesn't
21:53 have a problem it's working by the way a
21:56 bunch of people get angry at me because
21:58 I haven't done a video about the day in
22:01 September of 2001 and the reason why you
22:05 don't think I have is because they
22:07 didn't call it that day excuse me
22:10 I did call it that day I didn't call it
22:12 after the typical title so if you want
22:15 that episode look up that day and you'll
22:18 find what you're looking for
22:20 whining and calling me a shill [ __ ]
22:23 some kid came in looking shoe you
22:25 haven't made a video about this you know
22:27 so and so yeah I did so some
22:32 significantly horror horrific things
22:34 happens and they make money doesn't
22:38 matter if it's a little some kid
22:40 disappearing some college student
22:41 disappearing on a vacation a couple
22:43 getting murdered in Mexico they turn all
22:47 of it in to profit
22:49 isn't that amazing so if you've ever had
22:53 a loved one it ever gets hurt in these
22:55 events and I've had plenty of people get
22:57 hurt in the Vegas thing some horrific
22:59 [ __ ] stories let me tell you all the
23:03 news organizations made a [ __ ] ton of
23:06 money off of those deaths hmm don't you
23:12 see and I know I'm preaching to the
23:14 choir trust me I'm gonna say a
23:15 rhetorical statement so please don't
23:17 think I'm insulting your intelligence
23:19 but don't you see how [ __ ] up that is
23:22 right private for-profit news interferes
23:27 with all the motivations of reporting
23:30 the objective truth that may not be as
23:32 exciting as the truth all right so it's
23:37 in their best interest to grab the
23:39 script from some I don't know agency
23:41 that's maybe not so much for the
23:44 American people not so much for the
23:45 world people and they're gone we're
23:48 gonna make this event get ready band
23:50 here's what you're gonna say that here's
23:52 how you're gonna analyze it it's just
23:53 like the Philosopher's that tried to
23:55 stop the robot deep thoughts from
23:59 existing and Hitchhiker's Guide to the
24:01 galaxy and they came in yelling and
24:02 screaming don't turn that machine on and
24:05 I said why machine was tasked with
24:07 finding the answer to life the universe
24:10 and everything is that's an answer that
24:12 we do we're human beings were
24:14 philosophers were supposed to figure out
24:15 that answer when the computer said hey
24:18 relax it's gonna take me 7 million years
24:22 7 or 11 million years to come up with
24:26 the answer so you got some time
24:27 why don't you aren't you analyze what
24:30 might actually be my answer and you'll
24:34 make a ton of money between now and then
24:36 oh my god that's great thinking you know
24:38 they run off and they are okay so it's
24:41 in their best interest to go along with
24:43 all this stuff when the BBC announced
24:44 that wt7 went down we're at 30 minutes
24:48 before it did they're getting a script
24:51 and when the chick started doing the
24:53 script too soon they killed her feed
24:55 just like a Hollywood [ __ ] movie and
24:57 they didn't like there's a feed problem
24:59 give me a break right and the guy in the
25:01 UK sitting on BBC Live was like Oh
25:03 we've lost that feed she was [ __ ] up
25:05 and doing the script too soon because
25:06 the building was right behind her
25:08 perfectly fine and hopefully that's not
25:10 news to any of you but if it is you've
25:12 got some researching to do but there's
25:15 something else a lot deeper and it's the
25:18 subject of my episode trauma journalism
25:19 but let me bring up the date here they
25:23 have learned that when you're in trauma
25:25 you are sort of in an area of physical
25:29 suggestibility has to do with the fight
25:31 or flight mechanism of the brain if you
25:34 were in your backyard like I am right
25:36 now and I had like a lion coming around
25:38 the corner and he's [ __ ] doing that
25:40 drill and thing like I haven't eaten in
25:42 a week full-grown I'm gonna go into a
25:48 fight-or-flight mode where I'm going to
25:50 go all the blood in my upper brain is
25:53 going to constrict and I will have my
25:56 creative right side heavily handicaps
25:59 when my left side gets pumped double
26:02 hard to get us out of this [ __ ]
26:03 problem because my left is the logical
26:06 side that's not emotional and it's gonna
26:08 be like jump over that fence to climb up
26:10 this thing fast baby because he's gonna
26:13 come after you maybe pick up something
26:15 and use it as a weapon to freak him out
26:17 for a second way you climb up right no
26:20 no that shit's gonna work I'm gonna die
26:22 if that's the case but now if you were
26:25 to be able to pause reality time is
26:28 still going but you pause the lion you
26:31 pause me we're just frozen then someone
26:34 comes up and whispers in my ear well my
26:36 brain is in this horrible
26:37 fight-or-flight mode you know they tell
26:41 me
26:41 ice creams hot ice cream is really hot
26:45 it's too hot to put in your mouth ice
26:47 cream hot ice cream side and then they
26:50 let it go they all conclude somehow I
26:53 survived I forgot I had an elephant gun
26:56 on me I probably won't remember the
27:00 person whispering in my ear this piece
27:02 of information it's part of the MKULTRA
27:05 program they either would rape you or
27:07 expose you to shock treatment or
27:10 Soundwave treatment where they would
27:12 literally level all of the organized
27:15 energy in your brain to go back to
27:17 a basic mean which is what shock
27:20 treatment does and then they program you
27:24 they tell you things boom then they let
27:26 you come out of that status you regain
27:28 your identity in your brain slowly over
27:32 time they treat you like a million bucks
27:33 it's completely different than that
27:34 horrific room that you were in look like
27:36 a scene out of Jacob's Ladder and you
27:39 can't remember what they said to you but
27:42 the second they take you back downstairs
27:43 in that horrible [ __ ] hospital and
27:45 they start doing weird [ __ ] - boy doll
27:47 comes back everything they ever told you
27:49 the line comes around the corner and I'm
27:51 thinking I don't know why but ice cream
27:53 is really hot right it's trauma
27:56 programming okay when you read the news
28:00 it's very strategically organized it is
28:05 usually a traumatic story a feel-good
28:08 story a traumatic story a feel-good
28:10 story traumatic story feel good story or
28:14 traumatic story in kale to programming
28:17 story traumatic story MKULTRA
28:19 programming story it is essentially
28:22 anything to shock you I mean the news is
28:25 getting horrible nowadays I turned on
28:28 the news today and it was like an
28:29 eight-year-old boy had been impaled by a
28:32 bush or a tree or something the kid had
28:35 like a two-inch thick branch come
28:38 through his back on his right side and
28:39 go out the front of his body he survived
28:42 he's fine but man they showed the
28:44 picture of this damn kid just impaled
28:47 and I've seen that for adults but it's
28:49 much different to see a vulnerable child
28:51 the kid was so cool he walked his sister
28:54 home from school I don't know how the
28:55 hell it happened I didn't read the whole
28:56 article but he walked his sister home
28:58 and then he passed out because he's
28:59 losing so much blood he's probably in a
29:01 major [ __ ] amount of physical and
29:03 mental trauma hats off to this kid he's
29:07 already a hero he's only eight years old
29:09 but next to that is like other
29:11 propaganda about what I'm supposed to
29:13 believe about politics about a
29:16 politician about a world policy about
29:19 you know anything hmm many of you are
29:24 familiar with project Mockingbird it was
29:26 a mid 50s program developed by the CIA
29:29 the
29:30 said we are going to induct news
29:34 reporters into our organization they're
29:36 going to learn how to lie and we're
29:38 going to put them right back out there
29:39 to corrupt the news they're going to
29:43 tell you what we want you to hear
29:45 controlling the entire narrative of
29:47 published yellow journalism and then
29:50 on-air personalities they also
29:52 discovered that people develop loyalty
29:55 towards news announcers I talked about
30:00 whose line is that last season amazing
30:04 50 show which proves that women were not
30:06 repressed back in the day as you have
30:08 been taught
30:09 everyone's repressed a little bit but
30:12 these stories about this is crazy but
30:13 anyway host of that show for 17 years
30:16 was the man named John Daly and John
30:19 Daly unbeknownst to most people was a
30:22 famous radio newscaster he actually
30:24 reported on Pearl Harbor and 41 which is
30:28 nine years before the show started
30:30 but then he was on TV and he did the
30:31 news most of the week and then he did
30:34 this game show at night right it's the
30:36 first intelligent game show you'll ever
30:38 see on TV well once you learn John Daly
30:44 from especially you know what's my line
30:46 if you're into that he's the most
30:49 lovable guy on planet earth now he
30:51 escaped this process he was a real man
30:54 and by the time he was done with his
30:56 career you know the the other people
30:59 were coming past him taking it over and
31:02 they were all into it a lot of the
31:05 newscasters and in addition to being
31:07 part of Project Mockingbird are also
31:09 pulled into the Council on Foreign
31:11 Relations they get to be a part of all
31:15 these aristocratic things you know
31:16 Anderson Cooper who's a Vanderbilt child
31:20 whose brother we think might have been
31:22 sacrificed because his mother is part of
31:24 some [ __ ] cult that that literally
31:28 documents have one child to treat like a
31:31 prince and have the other child to to
31:35 sacrifice and I think his brother after
31:37 age of 21 died mysteriously right
31:40 there's a picture of them on a bed
31:43 where the mother is wearing this
31:45 ambulance of the cult she's in plus all
31:47 this crazy dark Madonna [ __ ] on the wall
31:50 behind her and the Pope is wearing the
31:52 same damn thing and it's their swimming
31:54 pool with all these crazy tiles that all
31:58 these kids are tortured in in Tony
32:01 Podesta's artwork so if you ever see
32:02 little girls with their hands not just
32:05 fairly tied but they got him behind
32:07 their backs
32:07 with their bodies violated in his
32:10 artwork again John Podesta was Hillary
32:13 Clinton's campaign organizer and his
32:18 brothers this [ __ ] super Krete
32:20 they're both pedophiles are both
32:21 probably child murderers but it's just
32:24 my opinion based on the I've seen if
32:29 they ever get their day in court they
32:30 can prove it otherwise but Anderson
32:32 Cooper did his internship where at the
32:36 Central Intelligence Agency didn't he
32:38 oh wow and then look how famous the kid
32:42 got right total bonafide Project
32:47 Mockingbird again I've said it a couple
32:49 times on the show you really need to get
32:51 to the point you watch Rod Serling's
32:53 1959 interview which is one of the only
32:57 interviews he really gave about the show
33:00 the twilight zone and he said look
33:02 they're doing pre censorship now they're
33:04 finding gullible people and simply
33:06 saying okay we're gonna make this person
33:09 Anderson Cooper and they believe all the
33:11 [ __ ] and so boom you get the job
33:14 you'll never not believe what we tell
33:15 you because we already know that's what
33:17 you believe I dated a girl whose niece
33:21 was being inducted into same
33:24 organization and she would come to the
33:27 aiight Thanksgiving dinner with them and
33:30 they were so pleased that she was in
33:33 this thing because the whole family was
33:34 military and I was military too but I
33:36 woke up but they said well what kind of
33:39 questions are they asking you because
33:40 this girl was like you know getting
33:42 interviewed for like six months and they
33:45 said well they want to know what I
33:46 thought about that day the September
33:51 eleventh day they wanted to know that I
33:53 knew who did it
33:56 which is the official fake news about
33:59 who did it there they're asking this kid
34:02 to go along with every [ __ ] narrative
34:04 that they've invented over the years to
34:06 make sure that she is as gullible as
34:08 gullible can be and they found the right
34:12 person
34:12 super academically brilliant but she's
34:15 just dumber than a [ __ ] bag of
34:17 hammers right and will remain dumber
34:19 than a bag of hammers unless she [ __ ]
34:20 wakes up which is gonna take some major
34:22 event that most likely will never occur
34:24 in her lifetime unless something really
34:26 changes in this country but then how
34:29 does the news get to us if it's not
34:31 going to be profit based doesn't someone
34:34 have to pay for it and then even if you
34:37 created some slush fund like let's say
34:39 the government of the United States of
34:41 America said okay we are going to make a
34:45 fund it's going to be ten billion
34:49 dollars a year and we're going to allow
34:53 individuals to create news organizations
34:55 journalistic news organizations that
34:58 they are going to be nonprofit so they
35:01 get a very meager salary in fact we're
35:02 gonna make sure the salary actually
35:04 hurts a little bit no one's gonna be
35:06 making a million dollars what the [ __ ] I
35:08 don't know Anderson Cooper's salaries
35:09 like what sixty million dollars a year
35:11 so God forsaken amount of money and
35:13 maybe even a hundred million it's some
35:15 ridiculous amount of money like the guy
35:17 needs anymore cash right and let's just
35:20 say we create a constitution of news how
35:23 a story is found how it is vetted how it
35:26 is vetted by other people
35:28 sort of like peer-reviewed documents
35:29 right you can't just say jelly beans
35:32 cure cancer until you actually do some
35:34 lab studies and prove it right but now
35:38 here's the problem if it's a independent
35:42 group of people several different
35:44 independent groups they don't have
35:45 anything to do with each other
35:46 necessarily what stops corporations and
35:50 controlling bankers and all kinds of
35:52 other forces from putting together a
35:56 cabal of individuals that will pretend
35:59 to be unbiased but still bring us biased
36:03 information hmm well the solution is
36:07 actually already happening but that
36:09 ain't the solution
36:11 the BBC tries to do the this this latter
36:16 example that I gave you
36:17 they have state-funded news it's all
36:21 under one roof called the British
36:24 Broadcasting Company you know they have
36:28 like channel four which is the fun
36:30 channels where they create some amazing
36:31 freakin shows man it's truly fantastic
36:35 some of the stuff they create but you
36:38 can't do a hit piece on the monarchy
36:41 because the monarchy has people that
36:44 read the [ __ ] before you get greenlit in
36:46 the BBC plus there's laws so you can't
36:49 touch these people way to go Britain way
36:51 to go so what's actually happening now
36:55 that works mmm
36:57 well it's not foolproof by any stretch
37:00 of the imagination
37:01 but it is the way that everyone catches
37:03 the fake events the crisis actors right
37:07 the people that have been for different
37:09 things at four different locations and
37:10 you better believe this season we're
37:11 gonna do a hit piece on them but we have
37:15 organizations websites I should say that
37:19 support uploading videos of individuals
37:23 experiencing things all around the world
37:24 I don't know if many of you follow the Q
37:29 movement but there was a point where not
37:34 Q necessarily but a bunch of these
37:36 surrounding folks that support him
37:38 bumped into the scandal that went down
37:40 in Haiti about maybe four or five months
37:44 ago the United States military actually
37:47 went down to Haiti and secured the
37:49 airport there were massacres going on on
37:53 this particular weekend because the
37:56 protesters got tired of some of the what
38:00 was reported by them and I'm just
38:02 repeating the child traffickers related
38:05 to various foundations that were down
38:08 there ripping people off one of the
38:10 foundation leaders ran for president
38:13 last time so these people who are
38:16 largely unarmed they were protesting in
38:20 the street
38:23 because some people have been murdered
38:24 who were a part of I think they're being
38:29 murdered on both sides the foundation
38:31 people bring murdered and people who
38:32 were going to be reporting on them got
38:34 murdered but they ended up killing
38:36 several dozen people in the street and
38:39 people were filming with their
38:40 telephones and those videos boom right
38:44 up to the web and there was a woman on
38:46 Twitter account that grabbed a bunch of
38:47 them and reposted them and there were
38:50 some horrific things that were happening
38:52 in the days following how they got rid
38:54 of the bodies was was straight out of
38:59 Deadwood and I mean literally for those
39:01 of you seen that series whoo was that
39:06 kind of thing
39:06 there are arteries like obviously
39:11 YouTube YouTube gets heavily censored
39:14 but they usually only get censored with
39:16 a couple different things you mentioned
39:18 some sensitive words and they will D
39:21 monetize your video trying to try to
39:23 basically warn you don't go too far off
39:25 the tree off the rails otherwise we're
39:27 gonna make this a non profit for you
39:30 right the other one is that if you steal
39:32 someone's content then they'll do a
39:35 copyright strike and they can either
39:37 take your video down what just happened
39:38 to me a couple times god bless that 1996
39:41 David Copperfield footage I used holy
39:44 [ __ ] unbelievable but the other one is
39:48 sites like lively calm and that's my
39:54 personal feeling that live leak because
39:57 live leak has featured videos right
39:59 they'll pick something they'll feature
40:00 it they do express a bit of a bias
40:02 within their featured videos but you
40:04 know okay everyone's gonna have their
40:06 bias I got my bias right I don't hate
40:10 our president right so that's my bias
40:13 but if you just watch over everything
40:15 that comes through live leak you could
40:17 just see all the feeds and there's only
40:20 about there's about 15 20 videos that
40:24 make it to the main feed which is
40:25 featured stuff and then if you go into
40:27 just submitted which is a tab across the
40:29 top you do get a lot of crap because
40:31 everything's free you know you can just
40:33 keep uploading stuff you can link your
40:35 YouTube video and
40:36 that kinda thing but there's a lot of
40:39 truth and a lot of these posts Twitter's
40:42 a platform where you can upload a video
40:44 for the most part you can get it up
40:46 there I've seen some outrageous stuff
40:48 for all the all of the censorship they
40:52 did on Alex Jones man they allow a lot
40:54 of stuff up there like the woman who
40:55 posted all the things about Haiti super
40:57 graphic [ __ ] man and they let it up
41:00 there all right so there's a dude named
41:05 Ken calm K I am do t his last name is
41:11 calm so he changed his last name he's am
41:13 i believe he's german based or Austrian
41:16 based he's German he's a big 6 foot 8
41:18 guy he's a big lovable teddy bear he
41:22 used to be a well-liked I don't want to
41:27 insult the guy but I think his biography
41:29 on himself is he was heavy into security
41:34 let's put it that way and he learned how
41:35 stocks work and and he was just he made
41:39 himself a tremendous amount of money I
41:42 have no idea how much money that guy
41:43 made but if someone told me he was a
41:45 billionaire I wouldn't be the slightest
41:47 bit surprised he made the website called
41:50 mega download.com
41:51 which was hosted in Singapore and
41:54 allowed anyone to upload anything and he
41:57 had it so encrypted that he could find
41:58 out what you uploaded unless you publish
42:01 the video or share the link with him
42:03 right
42:04 well people used it to upload movies
42:07 that were copyrighted and they were
42:10 doing everything they could to stop that
42:11 from happening
42:12 but what ended up happening was he is
42:16 wanted for things he did in his past
42:20 because I think maybe it's more along
42:23 the lines that he knows too much because
42:27 he's so good what he did now maybe he
42:29 broke some laws here and there he was
42:32 actually a I managed some projects for a
42:35 company back in 2003 and he was one of
42:39 our clients and he did have a problem
42:42 paying his bill at one point we created
42:45 literally probably one of the most
42:46 gorgeous websites the world has ever
42:48 seen and he wouldn't pay for
42:51 but I'm sure he's past that now but
42:54 anyway the reason why I mentioned this
42:55 guy he lives in New Zealand right now
42:56 which is literally a country that was
42:59 created to host the five eyes he's there
43:01 because there's no extradition New
43:04 Zealand is rumoured as the place where
43:05 all of the politicians of the world that
43:07 fear being detained and sent to Gitmo
43:09 will go to live that's hearsay I don't
43:13 know if that's true but definitely
43:15 extradition is not something that they
43:17 do he lives in this incredible compound
43:21 he was arrested the day that dot-com was
43:25 mega calm my return make it download
43:27 scuse me was was shut down it was
43:29 completely a legal seizure of his
43:31 website the FBI and the CIA all lied to
43:34 local law enforcement and they went in
43:36 and literally bolt-cutters book cut the
43:39 the wires to his server array and he's
43:45 been fighting this case ever since that
43:46 happened now he's recently well sorry no
43:49 recently about five years ago he created
43:50 a replacement and he made it further
43:54 encrypted you can put all your stuff in
43:56 his cloud it's amazing he is telling on
44:00 his Twitter account if you want to
44:02 follow the guy he's probably one of the
44:04 people worth following on Twitter you
44:06 won't agree with everything he says but
44:08 then who the hell are you gonna agree
44:09 with everything that they say right
44:11 certainly not me
44:14 but he is telling us that this year in
44:16 2019 he is going to launch a brand new
44:19 social media platform that is going to
44:22 replace YouTube Facebook Twitter and
44:27 Instagram if there is anyone on planet
44:31 earth they can do this it is him he has
44:33 the money he has the the resources the
44:36 people he's got some of the most
44:38 brilliant programmers on planet earth in
44:41 his organization and he says very
44:46 explicitly two things that are very very
44:48 important for us perhaps to solve the
44:50 problem that we're dealing with and
44:51 again there's always going to be a
44:52 corrupt faction uploading you know
44:55 disinformation that kind of thing but
44:56 together I think if we compare it to the
45:00 other resources that we have that are
45:02 actually on the ground and not
45:03 like [ __ ] Jim Acosta you know just
45:06 showing up and doing some shitty video
45:09 on the border we'll be able to see what
45:11 channels are real and which ones aren't
45:13 but he said two things one you can
45:17 upload as much as you want which means I
45:20 can put this channel on it whatever
45:21 channel he or whatever service he
45:23 creates because right now I can't put
45:26 deep thoughts almost anywhere because
45:28 the videos go over an hour and everyone
45:29 has this one hour limit which sucks vid
45:35 me gave me a chance to actually upload
45:37 because the founders saw the channel and
45:40 was like this is cool you have an
45:42 infinite account it's awesome
45:44 I really missed them but the second
45:48 thing he said which is so important it's
45:51 the First Amendment of the Constitution
45:52 of the United States he said there will
45:54 be no censorship there will be freedom
45:57 of speech on this platform and that is
46:00 HUGE if this guy launches this year it
46:04 will be the absolute perfect timing for
46:07 folks like us seeking the truth and
46:09 trying to get around fake media what we
46:13 have to do is absolutely hobble them
46:15 from the ground up right we have to
46:19 replace these things if you think about
46:21 it think about how the web unfortunately
46:24 destroyed brick-and-mortar stores right
46:27 nobody wants to go down to a store and
46:29 try something on which is not really
46:31 true it's just it's still a novelty for
46:34 a lot of folks to be overwhelmed with
46:36 your job and your responsibilities at
46:38 home and so you just get on like look
46:40 man I need a new toaster this is what I
46:42 can get it right now because I'm
46:43 exhausted you know that extra little
46:45 stop at Walmart or Target wherever you
46:48 gonna get that toaster unfortunately
46:51 it's not the mom-and-pop shop that sells
46:52 them it's just too much you know when I
46:56 my kid was really young and I was a
46:59 single dad I had to take ID to go pick
47:01 her up and then we had to go to the
47:02 grocery store then we get to go home and
47:04 eat right well my kids tired you know
47:07 she's literally maybe an hour and a half
47:09 two hours from going to bed and I'm
47:11 pushing her around a shopping cart and
47:13 she's she's bored out of her mind
47:16 right and so we ended up figuring how to
47:19 play some games in the store that didn't
47:21 disturb anybody in the shopping cart to
47:23 keep her busy but that's why online
47:27 destroy the brick-and-mortar stores
47:29 right okay well the novelty is gonna
47:32 wear off it will wear off we are not
47:33 going to lose buying things online but
47:36 it's going to be the things that are
47:37 more sort of cut and dry black and white
47:41 items like you know maybe a phone
47:45 charger or something right where you can
47:48 wait a couple days or a day for it
47:50 shipped to you but eventually I do
47:52 believe we're going to get back into you
47:56 know buying our clothing at these
47:57 locations you can't go out to eat online
48:00 right so you've got to go into those
48:02 places so I think we're just adjusting
48:05 what we put online and I think that the
48:07 brick-and-mortar stores are gonna have a
48:09 little off topic here but bear with me
48:11 this is gonna feed back into how we're
48:13 gonna get rid of news the
48:15 brick-and-mortar stores need to sell the
48:17 benefit of brick-and-mortar you can't
48:20 try on shoes right well all the shoe
48:22 manufacturers for some godforsaken
48:24 reason in 2019 still can't agree on
48:27 what's a size 9 for men what's a size 10
48:30 for women right well they tend to run a
48:32 little high on that a little low on that
48:34 one just go into the store put them on
48:38 until they feel right right the one
48:41 thing that the cube movement has pulled
48:42 out of the literally thin air
48:44 are people that two years ago never
48:50 imagined having a YouTube channel in
48:52 their life and now they got over a
48:53 hundred thousand subscribers or even a
48:55 million subscribers why because they
48:59 found out that they had the journalistic
49:01 bug they're able to investigate they're
49:03 able to discern things they have
49:04 intelligence as well as you know smarts
49:08 so they're able to deduce those
49:11 individuals are budding new next
49:14 generation journalists now everyone's
49:18 susceptible to being bought off right
49:21 and I mean everyone including me
49:24 including you as much as we'd like to
49:26 wave the flag no there's no way that we
49:28 can't okay well there's
49:30 probably lower thresholds for some
49:33 people and higher thresholds for other
49:34 people there are things that some of us
49:36 would never do and there's things that
49:39 things that we might do right I get this
49:42 comment every once in a while and I'm
49:44 not trying to start a movement here okay
49:47 but folks who listen to coast-to-coast
49:49 am with George Noory they they'll listen
49:54 to this show and they'll be like all the
49:56 alien episodes and that kind of thing in
49:57 there you know there's probably about a
50:00 handful of comments and all the comments
50:01 section saying man you should take over
50:03 for George Noory you should do coast to
50:05 coast am because the guys getting close
50:07 to retirement and you know who's gonna
50:09 take over the show well imagine me
50:12 reading that and I'm thinking I used to
50:13 listen to coast to coast am it's a huge
50:16 investment in the middle of the night
50:17 unfortunately I don't know if he records
50:19 life he says he does but imagine me
50:22 going on a show like that or getting my
50:24 own show like this someone sees deep
50:26 thoughts as some network and they're
50:28 like out and we need something edgy and
50:30 let's let the guy cuss and stuff right
50:32 or whatever well if I got on coast to
50:34 coast again there's FCC laws against me
50:36 using the language that I'm using now I
50:37 can go on Sirius radio and let everybody
50:40 have it but then again I've got a little
50:44 market don't I'm 3300 people as of this
50:47 recording that have blessed me with
50:51 their subscription and so I feed those
50:55 individuals what I like to hear and it
50:57 just so coincidentally happens to be
50:59 what you want here but what if I took
51:01 that deal the state was offered
51:04 something similar or the exact offer and
51:06 I walk into the negotiations I'm like
51:08 okay well what's the salary like what
51:11 are the what are the requirements right
51:13 how many days a week do we do this show
51:15 you're like five days a week and your
51:18 salary is about $250,000 a year now
51:21 Georgia might have just had a big
51:22 laughter yeah I wish and then they say
51:26 that magic works but remember Joe Rogan
51:30 who believed in the moon missions being
51:32 fake and then he went syndicated he
51:35 syndicated his show made nearly a 10
51:38 million dollars as the rumor has it was
51:40 seven million and then all of a sudden
51:42 he believed we went to the moon
51:44 he's allowed to bring in Graham Hancock
51:47 and talk about doing acid and DMT but
51:50 he's not allowed to talk about certain
51:52 things so if you're on this franchise
51:55 man the franchise I don't even know one
51:57 coast to coast am started but it's
51:58 several like it's at least two decades
52:00 old maybe it's even more they're gonna
52:03 say we don't talk about these things
52:04 it's not part of the format it's not
52:06 part of the listener base it's not that
52:07 we're trying to censor you which is
52:08 nobody wants to hear that crap okay now
52:13 I look at my life you know I'd rather do
52:16 something else quite frankly but I love
52:19 this show because I can do in the middle
52:20 of the night middle of the day I can't
52:22 smoke a cigar at 6:00 a.m. in the
52:23 morning I can do two shows in a row if I
52:26 want I get to release them in whatever
52:28 pace I want I control the editing I
52:30 control the topics and we stay real on
52:32 the show right if I want to cuss because
52:34 I feel like it there you go
52:35 I live in a free world it's beautiful no
52:38 one comes and gets me in the middle of
52:39 the night I have never ever ever had a
52:42 single communication and especially in
52:45 kilcher radio the show I had before this
52:47 one which was way more controversial
52:50 no one's ever contacted me no one's ever
52:53 threatened me ever ever ever just a few
52:58 colorful comments in the comment section
53:00 which are almost more funny than they
53:02 are frustrating so but someone could
53:07 probably say okay you put your two cents
53:11 in you're gonna leave your episodes up
53:12 there once you finish season four and
53:14 then quit and we'll give you something
53:18 else in life that you want you have
53:20 plenty of money you'll have that nice
53:22 Newport Beach house and we'll get you
53:24 get to your Lambo and we'll get you your
53:26 Bentley or whatever the hell you want
53:28 you pick and with those tools and with
53:31 your looks and your brains you'll be
53:33 able to get everything else you want but
53:34 we'll make sure you stay employed what
53:36 do you say what do you say I'm looking
53:40 at 50 years old going hmm damn you're
53:43 right I did teach a bunch of people [ __ ]
53:44 maybe you know and it's like maybe I do
53:47 maybe I don't
53:49 the friends of mine that I've talked
53:51 about a little bit on the show where I
53:53 say I have friends that have prices and
53:55 they just go as long as you get yours
53:56 who cares
53:58 well that's a globalist non empathetic
54:01 mindset right
54:02 I would imagine my threshold is
54:05 extremely high so as we build a news new
54:08 news organization or a new method by
54:10 which we gain reality maybe it's not a
54:13 product anymore maybe there is no
54:16 definitive news product what if all the
54:20 humans on earth actually give it to you
54:23 in a Kubrick arthur c clarke format
54:28 overnight a monolith shows up in every
54:34 single major city around the world he'll
54:36 maybe every city in the world a little
54:38 village in scotland my little hometown
54:40 in Kansas one here in Huntington Beach
54:43 and it imbues mankind with telepathic
54:49 communication not that horrific every
54:53 single thought crap but just an overall
54:55 mean of consciousness and we we stop
55:02 having Wars as much because then we find
55:04 out that we really don't dislike each
55:05 other those that are the black sheep of
55:09 our society that do want us to war well
55:12 they they stick out like a sore thumb
55:15 but he maybe even they transform they're
55:17 like oh my god I just missed out on
55:18 empathy my parents you know didn't get
55:21 along that's what the Great Awakening is
55:24 being created by there's all of this
55:28 homogeneous information that we're
55:30 getting we're learning about Russians
55:31 and we're laughing at anyone telling us
55:33 that they're bad right
55:35 it's also exposing the Democratic Party
55:37 in the United States of America it's
55:39 amazing how much these [ __ ]
55:41 want war you know Trump pulls out troops
55:44 from Syria and you never saw more you
55:47 know hippy peacekeeping independent
55:50 party people Green Party and democratic
55:52 people scream bloody murder that we're
55:54 not sending our soldiers off to die our
55:56 young men and women to go off and die in
55:58 these wars to create potentially
56:01 horrible records in their brain that
56:03 they've hurt people they get back and
56:06 they're no longer 20 or 19 through 23
56:09 and they're like what the hell was I
56:10 doing
56:11 they told me these people were bad I was
56:13 really good at shooting a missile or a
56:14 [ __ ] drone rocket or shooting a
56:16 pistol or a gun and I killed these
56:18 people I don't know what I think about
56:21 that anymore you know was I being told
56:23 the truth
56:23 and then imagine you relied to and you
56:25 did these things and it bothers you you
56:27 can't go back and undo the past you
56:29 can't bring people back to life and you
56:31 know that you don't know their relatives
56:33 you'll never go back you're not gonna
56:34 circulate back through the theater of
56:36 war cuz you're older now and so you're
56:38 like oh my god there's someone telling a
56:40 story about me killing somebody I don't
56:44 want that history and so as we
56:47 communicate with each other we're
56:48 erasing those archetypes from mankind is
56:51 in general right it's a beautiful thing
56:53 and we're now learning about the revised
56:56 history we're learning about who the
56:57 enemies really are and again if I get
57:01 this stuff in the comments all the time
57:03 I'm just gonna make this as generic as
57:04 possible if you're towing a conspiracy
57:08 of who destroyed the world that's like
57:10 who destroys the world in daily basis
57:12 it's like twenty fifteen to twenty years
57:14 old and the buzz words that you're using
57:18 are part of that era of conspiracy I beg
57:23 of you to check yourself before you
57:25 wreck yourself okay because you're
57:27 probably being duped because you're
57:31 sitting in you're sitting in or this way
57:34 when you got that opinion all right and
57:36 it probably didn't stop until maybe like
57:38 five years ago in my research the people
57:42 that are the sort of lowbrow knee-jerk
57:46 folks don't we say rothschild a lot but
57:48 you know when we say that one name we
57:50 mean all of the oligarchy and
57:52 aristocracy that are like them right but
57:57 when you take the conspiracies from
58:00 those other moments in time what you're
58:01 doing is you're taking it from the
58:03 highest peak moments of fake news and
58:07 fake narratives even in the conspiracy
58:09 disinformation world and you're latching
58:12 on to it and then repeating it right I
58:15 will tell you this because I get this
58:18 comment a lot it's recently - a lot of
58:21 just the whole batch of them came in and
58:22 no I don't know where the hell they came
58:24 from
58:24 but they'll say you haven't accused the
58:28 so-and-so's of being the evil ones in
58:31 the world and therefore you're a shill
58:34 because you're inadvertently defending
58:37 them by not calling them out okay I'm
58:41 gonna make a little deal with you guys
58:43 it goes like this and again most of you
58:45 aren't this type of person but in the
58:47 off chance you're one of these kind of
58:49 folks or you know someone like this I
58:51 would say this I have done my homework
58:53 people I have done my homework talking
58:57 to people that know a lot more than
58:59 either one of us I've done my I do
59:04 firsthand interviews that I don't share
59:06 with you guys right and I don't want to
59:08 mean make him [ __ ] stupid Alex Jones
59:10 lie moment so this guy's I talked to cue
59:13 man but man he's bullshitting no I don't
59:16 know he was okay but I would say that I
59:20 have not found a especially a race of
59:23 people in this world that are more evil
59:26 than any other race okay
59:29 the one I belong to is pretty powerful
59:32 and pretty in control and pretty goddamn
59:35 evil just the just those ones in the
59:38 oligarchy aristocracy world they're not
59:41 us right you just I might share the DNA
59:45 same origin and the world that these
59:46 people share but they're not us they're
59:49 not those people that live in the
59:50 indigenous country over there their
59:52 abate they are on a different level of
59:54 [ __ ] as we like to say on this show
59:57 right but if I thought there was one
59:59 centralized cabal in one place over
60:02 there on the other continent I would
60:04 have called it out by now okay I will
60:08 most likely do an episode where I share
60:10 a big bucket of information that I have
60:14 on this but it's a very complex topic
60:17 and it's very difficult to explain
60:19 because a lot of people don't wanna
60:20 listen to you now can you go back in the
60:23 history of every single race on earth
60:25 and find religious beliefs and doctrines
60:29 that were written a long time ago talk
60:31 in two thousand plus years ago in some
60:33 cases where they they validated really
60:37 horrible [ __ ]
60:38 against mankind answer absolutely does
60:42 that mean that the people that are
60:43 current quote-unquote biological
60:46 descendants of those crazy people still
60:48 have those doctrines of course not
60:50 you would know okay but here's what I
60:53 want to make sure that you understand
60:55 and I know you do but I want to bring it
60:57 to the forefront of your mind in case it
60:59 has over the course of years of being
61:01 inundated by a ton of things that are
61:03 maybe more important in some cases are
61:05 more interesting to you right maybe
61:07 you're a moon person maybe you're a flat
61:08 earth person maybe your satellites don't
61:10 exist kind of person and so that's your
61:14 floor front that's your foreground
61:15 information that you're most interested
61:17 in it's the it's the most alluring
61:18 mystery for you and so these other
61:21 things go to the background it like
61:23 private for-profit news you know it's
61:25 fake and you read it with a discerning
61:26 eye nowadays I'm sure we need to
61:30 understand that information that comes
61:32 to you that has attached to profit and
61:34 attached to the five eyes and attached
61:36 to the banking cartels who again you
61:40 know Reuters bought ap in 2004 as I
61:43 understand it well there you go that's
61:45 all international news around the world
61:47 is owned by one organization you can
61:49 tell one of the most beautiful things
61:52 that's happened it helps you notice this
61:54 is that Donald Trump became the
61:56 president of the United States of
61:57 America and you could hate this guy but
62:00 as long as you're a truther something
62:02 has been revealed which is one how
62:05 utterly [ __ ] stupid
62:07 the politicians are who were there
62:09 before he got there right
62:12 Pelosi Chuck Schumer shift all these
62:15 people you can tell how stupid they are
62:18 because they can't think a thought that
62:21 is more intelligent than how stupid they
62:23 are right and you're not as dumb as they
62:25 are and so they lie to your face and
62:28 you're like did you just say that did
62:30 you just say that stupid [ __ ] line to
62:32 me like that was gonna work are you
62:34 kidding me right you can always find a
62:37 dumb person if you're smarter than them
62:39 because they just stick out like a sore
62:41 thumb now we've got five major stations
62:44 in the United States of America where we
62:46 get news right it's ABC NBC CBS you've
62:51 got msn
62:52 see CNBC okay well I'm sorry you got a
62:56 little more you got CNN right now you
62:58 have newspapers like New York Times and
63:00 LA Times that are in there too but I
63:03 would consider them the major online
63:05 ones and then which one you have the Fox
63:07 News Network supposedly Fox is totally
63:11 on board with Donald Trump and they're
63:12 the pinnacle of right the right wing
63:16 right well I see [ __ ] on their
63:19 website all the time did they throw in a
63:22 little bit of like you know Pro Trump
63:24 stuff well sure Sean Hannity is pretty
63:26 Pro Trump right I've hated that guy at
63:28 times that guy was the most rude person
63:32 to anyone that debated the events of
63:34 September 2001 absolutely rude
63:38 especially this dr. Steven Jones at
63:40 Brigham Young University who was fired
63:42 they're basically discovering the
63:44 chemical methodology which was used to
63:47 intentionally bring buildings down okay
63:50 he proved it and he proved it over and
63:53 over after he was forcibly retired he's
63:58 the guy that we've completely forgotten
63:59 a complete utter hero of that day and no
64:02 one remembers him because he was very
64:04 very poor at speaking in public he would
64:08 stammer so if you were to be really
64:10 forceful with him identity just want to
64:14 talk really sad he should have a
64:16 spokesman carries information for it but
64:19 they ate the dude alive and spit him out
64:20 and all of a sudden the same
64:21 [ __ ] who did that to him are
64:23 our heroes hmm but Lisa Rallo Rivera
64:28 apologized to one of the fathers he
64:30 apologized for architects and engineers
64:32 for 9/11 truth and then his show was
64:36 canceled the next week some people want
64:39 to tell the truth but they've been held
64:41 down by these organizations so now they
64:43 have the ability to tell the truth and
64:45 I'm hoping that there's a lot of those
64:47 folks that pop out in 2019 as hopefully
64:50 hopefully even though Q's turning into a
64:53 big tool right now
64:55 that his you know the rumors of arrests
64:58 and the population of Gitmo plus a bunch
65:01 of floating penitentiaries down there
65:02 and a couple other detention centers to
65:04 get filled up by these people who've
65:06 been lying to us
65:07 hopefully that event occurs I'm not
65:11 gonna hold my breath let me tell you I'm
65:12 gonna breathe very deeply until that
65:13 happens but it could be an earth
65:16 changing experience right for those of
65:21 you that don't follow Q the interesting
65:23 thing that's been said multiple times
65:25 and again we're all on the fence people
65:27 don't think that I'm some big Q guy it's
65:29 just living by his every breath I'm
65:31 utterly frustrated with what he's
65:34 predicted in the way that people he's
65:36 numerology to make everything seem like
65:38 he's predicting everything [ __ ] but
65:44 they're saying something like Trump
65:47 could run for 20/20 reelection but he
65:49 may not need to and what that means is
65:52 that the corruption that is holding this
65:53 country down and and inadvertently the
65:55 world because once you expose the
65:58 conspiracy here you Europeans just do
66:01 copy and paste right the yellow vests
66:03 are starting to unravel that [ __ ]
66:06 over there and more power to him right
66:08 you know it's time to reset every once
66:10 in a while isn't it you need to reinvent
66:13 yourself every once in a while and
66:14 countries need to read need to reinvent
66:16 themselves every once in a while but
66:19 they're saying that if the arrests were
66:21 to occur that he doesn't need to run
66:23 because things will be stable I think
66:27 most of us if he was able to pull that
66:29 off would want him to run again so
66:30 because we need more change it's you
66:33 know you can't have a hundred years of
66:34 corruption and fix it in four years you
66:37 know but we're we're trying right
66:39 everyone's trying I need you to look at
66:42 the press and simply say to yourself
66:44 every single day and to everyone is
66:46 willing to listen to you and be careful
66:48 right don't go out and tell people that
66:51 don't want to hear what you have to say
66:52 in a violent way you know like with a
66:55 they will get violent towards you or you
66:57 might get more you know aggressive
66:59 towards them work with people that are
67:01 on the fence I've got a buddy of mine
67:02 he's one of my best friends in the
67:05 entire world and he beautifully sits on
67:06 the fence he's like look I'm waiting for
67:08 the
67:08 arrests I want that to occur more than
67:10 you do but I don't see it happening I'm
67:12 like yeah I know man but private
67:17 for-profit and news mixed together is a
67:20 formula for propaganda it is probably
67:23 the alchemy of propaganda and that's
67:26 something you need to understand if I
67:28 said look I'm gonna make you the best
67:30 fruit drink you've ever had and you
67:32 going with me to the kitchen and I'm
67:34 [ __ ] blending all kinds of fruits and
67:36 vegetables out man this is getting the
67:37 celery's gonna do this amazing things
67:39 your palate but the very last second I
67:41 pull out a bottle of Drano and I pour a
67:45 shot glass Adreno and I go here's the
67:47 final ingredient douche and I put it
67:49 into the pitcher that I'm blending
67:52 you're gonna look at me and go the [ __ ]
67:55 was that oh no it's great for you it's
67:57 good I'll cleans you all the way on
67:58 you're gonna yeah it's called I die or
68:01 you fry my esophagus right and you won't
68:06 drink it okay good
68:09 you're smart now don't drink any news
68:15 anywhere at any point in time and I mean
68:19 any news anywhere right
68:22 have a conversation use your smarts
68:25 meaning everything you've memorized and
68:27 repeated about the world and your
68:29 intelligence which is your power to
68:31 deduce and ask yourself questions
68:33 constantly again YouTube channels and
68:38 also these video sites are a great way
68:40 to hedge your bets you know none of us
68:42 are gonna probably know the complete
68:44 truth even if we were there right I
68:47 think about it name any Massacre that
68:50 has happened in the United States which
68:52 has largely slowed down thank God but
68:55 name any of them to yourself and say if
68:58 you were there standing on the sidewalk
69:01 or wherever the hell this thing occurred
69:02 again I've talked to three survivors of
69:07 the Vegas thing and I've got close
69:09 friends of mine that it lost loved ones
69:11 at that event I mean that [ __ ] was real
69:14 why it happens completely different than
69:16 what the public was told okay
69:20 those people who were there i interview
69:22 and they have no clue what happened I
69:23 mean in terms of why it happened and all
69:25 the police information that they find
69:28 out afterwards right you know the time
69:30 of death for the guy that supposedly is
69:32 a shooter the corner made him die around
69:34 noon that day that's the official news
69:37 on that dude okay so how the hell did I
69:40 at noon but he pulled a bunch of
69:41 triggers around nine o'clock that night
69:43 hmm right we you know I know the whole
69:46 story about the two princes fighting
69:50 each other I hesitate to do those
69:52 episodes because that's what got you
69:54 know mr. Jones in a lot of trouble I'll
69:59 find a way to sneak it in but you it's
70:03 just it's a poison it's a poison but one
70:08 of the things that might do you a lot of
70:10 good is to worry about your local
70:13 community more than you worry about
70:14 other local communities of other worlds
70:16 that you have never been to and ever
70:17 will go to right sure when I see Paris
70:21 burning because the yellow jackets the
70:23 yellow vests excuse me are out there
70:25 fighting for freedom fighting for their
70:29 nationalism saying look I'm French and I
70:32 want to keep my country French right I
70:35 want my culture to be preserved I want
70:37 my DNA to be preserved
70:38 I want our population to go from a
70:40 declining population to an increasing
70:42 population then we'll figure out a way
70:44 to hold once we get to some you know
70:46 Maxim but I don't want all these
70:48 immigrants in my country I don't have
70:50 anything against them personally but
70:51 this is my country and they got their
70:53 own land and they need to go and fight
70:55 for what they like in their land right
70:57 one of the weirdest things about first
71:00 world countries versus third world
71:01 countries is that first world countries
71:03 have citizens that will fight for their
71:06 country they wouldn't think of being
71:09 anywhere else a third-world person it's
71:12 like they give up automatically [ __ ]
71:14 this place I'm out of here I'm going to
71:16 those first world countries and then I'm
71:18 gonna infect the DNA of that country so
71:20 that when they screw up their country
71:22 because I'm gonna vote for all the
71:23 idiots who got me you know illegal entry
71:26 into the country because they're good
71:27 people I'm gonna vote for those people
71:29 because now they're gonna be my leaders
71:31 because I just left the country with a
71:32 bunch of fake people are a bunch of
71:34 corrupt people running my country
71:35 I'm gonna immediately vote for the
71:37 corrupt people in this new country [ __ ]
71:38 the whole place up and then I'll just go
71:40 to the next place you know it's just
71:42 like that old saying you know they first
71:44 came from my neighbors or came for the
71:45 Christians that I didn't say anything
71:47 they came for the Jews and I didn't say
71:48 anything when they came from me there
71:49 was no one else to protest against my
71:52 capture right which fake news is a big
71:55 big big problem because it is the reason
71:58 why you argue with your neighbors is the
72:00 reason why you lose friendships with
72:01 your family members they have swallowed
72:04 the kool-aid my friend is on the fence I
72:08 go visit him and he has a roommate who's
72:11 a very sweet guy but the poor dude is
72:14 strung out on the real media I mean I go
72:17 over there and he's like just shoveling
72:19 this stuff in his brain and I'm sitting
72:21 there going man you might want to take a
72:23 break from this particular artery of
72:26 information and then I'll name a couple
72:27 alternatives and just try to get the
72:29 other information and the cool thing was
72:31 I went over there I think the last time
72:34 I was there I came out of the restroom
72:35 and I walked and he was watching Fox
72:37 News and again their fake news as well
72:40 but it was interesting that he branched
72:42 out and he looked at what he would think
72:44 would be the enemy and it was
72:46 interesting it's interesting for him to
72:48 get both sides of the fence
72:49 now it's both sides of fake but whatever
72:51 it's a start it's his brain changing
72:54 right it's a beautiful thing hopefully
72:57 then he branches out to other things and
72:59 again even if Q is a LARP a live-action
73:02 role-playing exercise the beautiful
73:05 thing about whoever that dude is or
73:06 dudes or whatever is they are pointing
73:10 us at information that is real they're
73:12 not
73:12 he doesn't offer like book chapters of
73:17 what the truth is he says look here look
73:19 here look here it's all in front of your
73:20 face you have more than you know you
73:22 know more than you know these are proofs
73:25 past and also their stuff and so it has
73:28 us looking in the right directions
73:30 thousands of kids have Q channels now
73:33 and they do amazing jobs analyzing this
73:36 thing and what I love the most is the
73:38 fact that they're journalists they're
73:40 just using YouTube as a mechanism they
73:42 using the cube movement to sharpen their
73:43 skills right now there's still
73:46 conspiracy people that are lost
73:49 you know really really sad like David
73:52 Icke for instance is unable to
73:54 understand what's going on in the Trump
73:55 administration he's he's unwilling to
73:57 look at a single queue post it's really
74:00 sad and so he doesn't acknowledge things
74:03 that he's actually for right getting rid
74:06 of human trafficking and getting rid of
74:07 pedophilia you know the amount of people
74:09 being arrested on a daily basis in this
74:11 country is off the hook right I mean it
74:14 has been it has been categorically the
74:18 most busy two years of Americans history
74:21 of America's history chasing down those
74:23 people we found him in in amusement
74:26 parks and you know very popular brands
74:28 that are supposed to be for kids right
74:31 but here's the last thing I want to tell
74:33 you you're a journalist you are you're a
74:37 journalist for your local community I
74:39 have told you if you've watched all the
74:41 episodes a million things that could be
74:44 going wrong in your hometown but you
74:46 need to do something about even if
74:49 there's someone from my hometown was
74:50 watching this which I don't anybody does
74:51 but even if they were they would wake up
74:54 to the Walmart conspiracy and go guys
74:57 why is Main Street completely [ __ ]
74:59 empty and we're completely embarrassed
75:00 about this because of that place down
75:03 the street that sells your paper towels
75:04 cheaper hmm remember when we had four
75:07 grocery stores they're all [ __ ] gone
75:09 except for maybe one and it's only out
75:11 of sheer convenience of travel that
75:13 those other ones are still alive because
75:15 someone doesn't drive completely out of
75:17 town to go to the Walmart most of them
75:19 well because it's only five miles square
75:21 so know that you can put some skin in
75:24 the game you can create your own YouTube
75:25 channel or if nothing else you can
75:27 comment and enlighten someone else have
75:30 a conversation with somebody and you
75:34 know use discretion you know you might
75:37 say look here's what I do all the time
75:39 especially when I want to describe Q to
75:42 somebody else I said it's smoke lounge
75:44 right and there's people come in from
75:46 all travels of life and you don't get
75:50 them all but you'll sit down and go you
75:52 know I know this sounds crazy but we've
75:54 done a lot of due diligence on this and
75:56 the more they hear you speak
75:57 intelligently they start to trust you
75:59 you're gonna be careful because teaching
76:00 is again the biggest liability you'll
76:02 ever have in your
76:03 right misleading someone will see a
76:05 child is probably the greatest sin on
76:07 planet earth right would you say look
76:10 there's this this and this and this and
76:12 this dude is waking us up to all this
76:14 stuff and if nothing else we're waking
76:16 up and that's the most beautiful thing
76:18 we can now see the corruption clearer
76:20 than we've ever seen it we now know more
76:22 about how the DOJ works the FBI the CIA
76:25 we know how those like organizations
76:27 work better than ever we now know what
76:29 this NSA is versus the CIA we know what
76:32 a FISA warrant is and why it exists and
76:34 why there's a secret court that grants
76:37 those you know those investigative
76:40 explorations and data gathering of the
76:42 NSA right I went back and forth on the
76:45 NSA I didn't know is like man it seems
76:47 like a corrupt organization they're
76:48 violating the Fourth Amendment I still
76:51 have a problem with that but it's the
76:53 only way we've been able to fight the
76:55 other people who violate the Fourth
76:56 Amendment it's very sad
76:58 maybe we can recapture our sovereignty
77:00 at some point right now it's illegal for
77:02 you to have information in your house
77:04 that can't be spoofed by these guys it's
77:06 literally illegal you don't know the
77:08 felony exists but it does exist if you
77:10 encrypt things on your hard drive
77:11 tighter than they can break it which is
77:14 not the case that's impossible to do
77:15 that but if you were to develop your own
77:17 software and get that done and then you
77:19 were to transmit one file over the
77:21 Internet to your buddy with that
77:22 encryption they can technically come and
77:24 arrest you but you don't know it it's
77:27 been that way since the mid nineties so
77:31 go see my episode on how they spy on you
77:33 to get the details on how that works so
77:35 know that you're important if you ask
77:38 yourself what can I do well first thing
77:40 is wake yourself up and then go to the
77:42 next low-hanging fruit and your people
77:44 circle people who trust you and say look
77:46 this is I was just like you I was asleep
77:48 or I thought this was true me use the
77:51 word asleep and you know I started doing
77:53 this investigating and my god this stuff
77:55 is right out there for you to see and
77:56 there you know blatant in your face when
77:59 you read the Arab Brotherhood website
78:01 it'll blow your mind it's full
78:03 infiltration it's converting you to
78:05 their technique it's instantiating
78:06 Sharia law all over the world you need
78:10 to figure out whether or not you want
78:11 that on one hand we got liberals saying
78:13 that women are exactly like men
78:15 regardless of training or qualification
78:17 and the other hand they're getting
78:19 destroyed by Sharia law we'll take your
78:22 pick mean because you can't have both
78:23 right I'd rather support equality
78:26 through modern first world country
78:28 methodologies then you going back to two
78:31 or three thousand years and your rights
78:32 get castrated and circumcised I should
78:35 say and getting murdered by your husband
78:38 because you lift off to the guy because
78:39 he was being an [ __ ] but he can
78:41 legally kill you takes two women to
78:43 fight one men in court unbelievable he
78:46 goes on and on and on fake news is how
78:50 they are programming our minds to accept
78:52 all the lunacy of the world you are what
78:54 you eat right you are what you put in
78:56 your mind so you better be very
78:59 discerning and have a pretense of how
79:01 you take in information because you have
79:03 to be able to go this place always lies
79:05 to me if you have someone in your life
79:07 that always lied to you and they started
79:09 talking to you you immediately go
79:10 [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]
79:12 [ __ ] the whole time they talk to you
79:13 so that you don't
79:14 so everything that they sent into your
79:16 brain is got [ __ ] attached to it
79:17 right and never sits on the truth shelf
79:19 it sits on the false shelf that's how
79:21 all news needs to be ingested from this
79:23 point for in your life until we change
79:25 things
79:26 hopefully kim.com will help us out that
79:29 others like him but even if he creates
79:31 the platform you have to create the
79:33 content right with that I will ask you
79:39 if you have not gone to deep thoughts
79:41 radio calm and you want to change feeds
79:44 that's the way to go so when you found
79:45 me on video you watch me in your car
79:47 there's an audio feed in there as well
79:49 or vice versa there's a lot Facebook
79:52 group which is awesome ran by some great
79:53 people that helped me out on the site
79:55 and I want to thank Kaz and Daniel for
80:00 being amazing people to help me out with
80:03 that site they just do a fabulous job
80:05 and all of you commenters we have a
80:07 family on there when I see people
80:09 comment
80:09 it's a family you know I also have a
80:12 patreon page we have just some great
80:16 folks in there as well and and I can
80:18 kind of see them on the Facebook page
80:19 too so it's great but for everyone who
80:21 donates a buck I really appreciate it
80:22 the way it works you give a dollar and
80:24 then you can see all the episodes
80:27 anywhere from five days before there
80:30 debuted to a day before the debuted not
80:34 a huge amount of traffic coming from
80:35 that feed but when you come to the video
80:37 and it's just been released and it
80:38 already has like five use those are the
80:40 patreon folks getting in early so anyway
80:42 appreciate you all thank you very much
80:44 take care of yourself and someone else
80:47 said I'll see in the next deep thoughts
80:48 over now
80:49 [Music]
