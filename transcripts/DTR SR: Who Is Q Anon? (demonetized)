00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen say my bubble ooh Babaloo
00:40 cigar here so as you can see today we're
00:44 gonna talk about queuing on what's
00:48 fascinating to me is that there's a lot
00:49 of people who don't know who queue went
00:50 on is a non stands for anonymous queue
00:56 not quite sure not quite sure what he
01:00 means by using the letter Q Q could be
01:03 question 17th letter in the alphabet
01:09 there's something called Queens
01:11 clearance which is Q clearance which is
01:15 used for the most top-secret of
01:17 top-secret things could be that the
01:20 person is so deep that's where they are
01:21 but typically anyone in sort of military
01:25 security it's pretty rare that they get
01:29 that deep that's a very short list if
01:32 they were if Q and on is what we think
01:35 it is or what he claims to be there are
01:40 a few things in the history of this
01:42 planet that will be more profound and
01:44 more amazing when retold as a story than
01:48 this character this is so huge it is it
01:56 is sort of funny I was gonna say
01:59 laughable but that's sort of a different
02:01 tense but it's just funny how people
02:03 don't know that he exists all these
02:06 people who are so political and they
02:07 think they know everything about
02:08 everything and who's bad guy who's a
02:10 good guy
02:11 and I asked him I said do you know who
02:13 Cuba Don is but nope okay don't think
02:19 you know what's going on q and on is
02:22 actually to give you sort of the the
02:27 footnote real quickly he started posting
02:29 I believe in late October of 2017 very
02:32 quickly his posts which are in sort of
02:37 these text forms okay
02:39 Fortran and eight ran the cryptic that
02:44 need to be deciphered but he was making
02:47 predictions about all kinds of things
02:48 that eventually came true and they came
02:50 true to the very day he said they would
02:51 come true amazing insider information
02:54 okay now we'll get back to his posts and
02:58 what he's doing I'm not gonna do any
03:01 like you know per post analysis
03:05 intentionally if I do it's simply
03:07 because I could remember one very
03:09 specific thing that he said he has all
03:12 kinds of interesting military based
03:15 things that he says now we have seen
03:18 things like this before in the past and
03:20 I will say there's two ways of saying
03:21 that we have seen anonymous groups the
03:26 one that wore the you know the mask from
03:28 the the movie with Natalie Portman in it
03:33 but there were these masks and it's a V
03:36 for Vendetta that's what it is right so
03:37 V for Vendetta
03:39 they wear these masks they wear black
03:40 hoods and they made this big claim that
03:43 they were going to be revealing all
03:45 kinds of truths about the world and
03:48 perhaps they were but very quickly
03:50 either the whole thing was a bunch of
03:52 [ __ ] or they were infiltrated and
03:55 replaced and anything that they had in
03:58 terms of a criminais ting evidence was
03:59 destroyed or hidden or whatever
04:02 anonymous never said any of their clan
04:04 was ever murdered I think that's
04:06 interesting so the way it's supposed to
04:08 work is it's like a shard you break it
04:10 and you have a bunch more pieces that
04:13 are equally powerful sort of thing if
04:15 you take a hologram
04:16 it's been pushed into a cube and you
04:18 break it every piece should have the
04:20 image in it it's crazy so
04:24 one way we've seen a queue and on sort
04:26 of thing before an anonymous source on
04:28 the internet giving us the people
04:30 information but the very first time I
04:32 ever heard of something like this and
04:34 I'm sure it's happened hundreds of times
04:35 before is during the Nixon Watergate
04:41 investigation now Nixon is interesting
04:47 man that guy we won't get into a big
04:48 Nixon and discussion don't worry sort of
04:51 a nerd sociopath can't be Kennedy can't
04:54 be too LBJ's you know taking a crap in
04:58 the room with the door open kind of
05:00 mentality but eventually he gets it
05:02 afterwards and he follows along and I
05:05 think he started to realize that he had
05:07 been planning to take a job from the
05:09 bankers that were gonna do with it were
05:11 essentially three or four decades into
05:13 the process of destroying this country
05:14 and he wanted to pull out the Nixon was
05:18 a dirty son of a [ __ ]
05:21 he was a criminal and probably a lot of
05:23 levels but he may have I don't know
05:26 rationalizing in an envelope that says
05:28 at least I'm serving my country while
05:29 I'm having my competitor shot in the
05:32 back after a rally and paralyzed like
05:35 Larry Larry Flynt that's a dirty [ __ ]
05:38 man can't just can't just let the best
05:41 man win you got to have your opponents
05:43 shot well they decided to try to kill
05:47 him or not who knows they hired someone
05:48 to do it
05:49 Nixon gets reelected but at some point
05:53 there's a bunch of debate about whether
05:55 or not make some wanted to go along with
05:56 what was going on he wanted to shut down
05:58 Vietnam or he wanted to do a bunch of
06:00 different things then he was being told
06:02 and so they fingered him for Watergate
06:06 whole thing was a setup but we had
06:09 something called deep throat which
06:12 really funny is that they came out with
06:14 the classic Linda Lovelace porn movie
06:17 around the same exact time called the
06:20 same thing which obviously meant a very
06:22 different thing in today's you know
06:25 potty mind society we don't understand
06:30 what that means but D throat was a
06:31 person that continually fed the press
06:34 the information about
06:36 what really went on at Watergate which
06:39 probably was more of the Schilly guys
06:41 that were trying to frame Nixon but this
06:45 time it's a little bit different cue
06:48 anonymous so when you wake up you guys
06:53 know how it is it's like that old
06:56 analogy I've given this many times in
06:58 season one I'll give it to you again
07:01 there's a hallway it's sort of like a
07:04 hospital because you're sick you're a
07:06 citizen the United States of America
07:08 you're a citizen in any freaking country
07:10 in this planet and you're trying to
07:12 figure out who's causing you to be sick
07:16 so you can get cured and down this
07:20 hallway there's a left side and there's
07:22 a right side and the entire time you
07:25 travel down this hallway you have
07:28 parties on the left and parties on the
07:29 right that you will blame if you find
07:32 yourself more left to oriented you'll
07:33 blame the right if you're more right
07:34 oriented you'll blame the left once you
07:37 get past that awakening and you realize
07:40 that the left and the right prior to
07:41 Donald Trump we're on the same exact
07:43 team they only pretended to be on
07:46 different sides of the coin right a real
07:49 basic example of left and right being
07:52 absolute bosom buddies is that the
07:57 military commissions act that George
07:59 Bush jr. put in power which says hey
08:03 communications companies you're not only
08:05 allowed to spy on people which is a
08:08 Fourth Amendment violation but you're
08:09 required to and you're required to give
08:12 your information over to the NSA
08:14 whenever we want it or whomever that
08:16 whatever three-letter acronym thing
08:17 totally violating the Constitution of
08:20 the United States a big no-no if you're
08:24 not from here so that was put in by a
08:27 right-wing neocon neoconservative and
08:33 his group of cronies Donald Rumsfeld
08:35 Dick Cheney all of them
08:39 and then it was handed over to Obama
08:41 who's a total leftist you know turn
08:44 American to a communist socialist
08:46 country you know white privilege but he
08:51 puts all of his own kind on food stamps
08:53 I mean literally he had nearly 50% of
08:56 this company country excuse me on
08:58 welfare you know the guy said in a
09:01 speech after Donald Trump started
09:04 running for president that there's no
09:06 way a president can create jobs there's
09:07 no way it could be done then after
09:10 Donald Trump started creating millions
09:11 of jobs
09:12 this piece of [ __ ] came out and said oh
09:14 you're just doing what I put in place oh
09:18 well you said it was impossible to ever
09:21 touch job growth so there's nothing that
09:23 you believe theoretically is possible go
09:26 back to bed with Michael but that guy
09:29 took the military commissions Act a
09:31 Fourth Amendment violation piece of law
09:33 and upped it to the next eight years
09:38 he also made capturing citizens in the
09:41 middle of the night and trying them in
09:43 military tribunals legal this guy was
09:49 closer to Hitler than you will ever know
09:51 Obama sealed his records as the first at
09:54 the expense of the United States
09:55 government of four million dollars he
09:56 sealed all of his own records the second
09:59 he got into office the only leader I
10:00 know that has ever done that is Adolf
10:02 Hitler and that's according to the
10:04 history books because his grandmother
10:07 was Jewish and his mother was a maid at
10:10 a Rothschild mansion and he's an
10:15 illegitimate son so the first thing in
10:18 the hallway your first level of
10:20 awakening is to come up there and say oh
10:22 it's not the left-right political
10:25 parties because they're on the same side
10:27 so you go up to maybe corporatism
10:29 and you start to see what corporations
10:31 do you start to see the fact there's
10:33 only a few corporations that run all of
10:35 the press all of your vision of reality
10:37 in this world is all you know just a
10:43 handful of groups Goldman Sachs and all
10:46 these guys Freddie Mac Fannie Mae all
10:48 they do is they when the money is
10:49 created by the European bankers and
10:52 handed over
10:52 Amerika interest rates that don't exist
10:54 right meaning we don't get any money to
10:56 pay the interest rates so we're totally
10:57 in a Ponzi scheme here it very quickly
11:00 gets handed in to the investment banking
11:03 houses which then feed it directly to
11:05 the corporations that these bankers who
11:08 created the money in the first place own
11:09 so they serve themselves in the entire
11:12 ecosystem so you might blame corporatism
11:15 now you have a unified thing in front of
11:17 you next one up if you come out of that
11:21 little coma you start looking at the
11:23 military-industrial complex and you
11:25 start thinking oh my god
11:26 it's these guys they start all the wars
11:29 that the corporation's use to make money
11:31 so the corporations are subservient to
11:33 the military-industrial complex man I am
11:37 so awake you think and then you learn
11:40 what the word oligarchy means the
11:43 banking elite the families that own
11:45 everything how do you find them well
11:48 just keep asking the question will who
11:49 owns that well who owns that well who
11:52 owns that and eventually you'll find the
11:55 families that own everything now you'll
11:57 start having problems actually getting
11:59 proper nouns out of people and the
12:01 Rothschilds can't hide anymore because
12:02 they boasted so much the 1800s the ones
12:06 our family the Hapsburgs Rockefellers
12:08 are pretty rich but they're still
12:09 subservient to the Rothschilds we're not
12:12 sure if they ever gained enough wealth
12:14 to be even remotely comparable to them
12:16 the Bush family has billions and
12:20 billions of dollars most likely some
12:23 people have estimated them in the
12:24 trillions doesn't really matter doesn't
12:27 matter once you find that you find the
12:30 tip of the pyramid there is nothing any
12:32 higher that's a horrible way to say that
12:34 but there's nothing higher then there's
12:38 a presidential election well every time
12:42 there's a presidential election it's a
12:43 [ __ ] joke right there's a legitimate
12:45 candidate that seems to have you know at
12:49 least a visible amount of intelligence
12:51 to speak George Bush Senior you know is
12:54 the exception however injured the
12:56 primary candidate is that it's supposed
12:58 to win they will find a candidate to run
13:00 against him or her that is so bad that
13:04 it's a foregone conclusion
13:06 who's going to win Al Gore was the only
13:09 guy who could have lost to George Bush
13:14 jr. and you know one of us think he
13:17 actually won the hing chad thing in
13:18 Florida John Kerry John is an old
13:23 skullenbones Yale University alumni
13:25 member with George Bush jr. he was
13:29 supposed to throw the election and he
13:33 did gone you know what Obama ran against
13:37 McCain and Sarah Palin McCain the
13:44 absolute trader of traders right no
13:47 contest reelection it didn't matter if
13:51 the other side won because they're both
13:53 puppeted by the same groups because all
13:56 of them belong to secret societies the
14:00 Bilderberg Group Bohemian Grove Council
14:02 on Foreign Relations trilateral
14:04 commission all kinds of secret little
14:07 societies that are spin-offs from
14:08 corporations and universities and
14:10 bankers but then there's something
14:13 different that happens this last
14:15 election we got a guy running for office
14:19 that has been a businessman his whole
14:21 life he inherited 1 million dollars from
14:24 his father
14:25 despite the fake news saying he
14:28 inherited hundreds of billions of
14:30 dollars the 1 million dollar inheritance
14:31 by the way was confirmed by his siblings
14:34 who said yeah he didn't get any more
14:37 than that he's developed real estate in
14:40 New York City and around the world for
14:41 40 years before he runs for president he
14:44 hasn't been accused of a single murder
14:46 if you know anything about land
14:48 development and big cities like New York
14:49 especially those ghettos we got to get
14:51 people out of buildings and tear them
14:53 down and blow them up and build better
14:54 better buildings there's always some
14:56 shady [ __ ] going on the most he was ever
15:01 accused of is using a demolition crew
15:03 that was out sourced and they had some I
15:07 think Polish workers
15:09 something like that that weren't
15:12 completely vetted but this is in the 80s
15:15 before we had the Internet and very
15:16 quick processes to check people out this
15:19 president unlike any other political
15:23 candidate okay let alone elected
15:27 official it me to the after 9/11 within
15:31 a couple of years he's on the radio
15:32 going they look like they were being
15:34 demolished these buildings I demolished
15:36 buildings all the time
15:38 interesting there's no better way to
15:43 judge a person than to look at their
15:45 children without their respectful
15:48 intelligent sweet empathetic sympathetic
15:53 his first three children seemed to match
15:56 all of these metrics sure he's a bit of
15:59 a player with the women I think what the
16:02 average man doesn't understand is the
16:03 stresses of running a business will eat
16:05 you alive and this guy is at a level a
16:08 thousand times higher than any of us in
16:10 terms of moving parts and stress and
16:13 what have you and I think the women that
16:16 get involved with these men understand
16:18 what that's all about unlike a rock star
16:20 that's only got about nine to ten years
16:22 worth of Fame this guy just gets more
16:28 famous and more famous Donald's got some
16:32 issues though right he's got an ego but
16:34 he has fun with it it's more
16:35 tongue-in-cheek not perfect he'll make
16:39 you cringe he'll make you cringe no
16:41 matter what but I'll also make you feel
16:43 amazing at the same time his ratio of
16:46 making you feel amazing versus making
16:48 you cringe I think is a lot higher but
16:50 the puppet presidents are all about
16:52 pretending to be president but not being
16:55 president not never engaging in any
16:57 actions that actually are presidential
16:59 very rarely passing anything that helps
17:04 the people right before you throw that
17:07 [ __ ] healthcare I'd be give me a
17:10 break
17:10 it's written by the insurance agencies
17:13 is written by the pharmaceutical and
17:14 medical industry to completely [ __ ] us
17:17 every day that we're alive they kept
17:20 telling you didn't have to change a
17:22 doctor but you do they kept telling you
17:23 that you couldn't be denied but you can
17:25 got plenty of friends of mine that can't
17:27 get it three of them as a matter of fact
17:28 to keep tabs on it because I call them
17:30 back every December through January and
17:32 I say did you get enrolled nope they
17:34 won't take me I'm paying out of pocket
17:39 because of previous conditions again you
17:42 get a broken arm they don't give a [ __ ]
17:43 though they'll wrap you up in some
17:45 plaster send you home no problem but if
17:46 you have cancer or you're just getting
17:50 old that's when the system has a little
17:52 chart and says what you've lived a
17:55 pretty good life you know how old are
17:56 you again hey why'd you go back in line
17:59 we're gonna take care that
17:59 eight-year-old because they're a lot
18:01 younger than you they got more life
18:03 ahead of them
18:03 you should be happy we're taking care of
18:05 that eight year old not you we got
18:07 limited resources in America right
18:10 please premiums have doubled and
18:13 quadrupled because we're not subsidizing
18:16 it anymore that was the scam that we had
18:18 to pay our tax dollars had to go in and
18:19 subsidize an already massively
18:22 profitable industry because they wrote
18:25 everything and the president didn't know
18:27 anything about business just a silly
18:30 loser in life but this is where cue and
18:34 on comes in we got our president we got
18:38 our new president some people [ __ ]
18:40 hate him but I'll tell you what you've
18:43 never owned a business if you ate that
18:44 man you never saw America in the 70s and
18:49 80s but those are you're old enough to
18:51 see it in the 60s and 50s you're right
18:53 there with me you don't remember old
18:55 America Great America pre 9/11 America
18:59 no the 90s were full of a lot of crap I
19:02 would flush down the drain but 80s and
19:05 before it was phenomenal to be in this
19:08 country and to be an American for the
19:11 most part in the 70s and 80s after
19:13 Vietnam war was over in 74 we left
19:16 pretty much everyone alone ever
19:17 else was fighting wars the Falkland Wars
19:19 and and the iran-iraq war
19:24 maybe the Afghanistan Russian war
19:26 everyone else was fighting we weren't
19:28 fighting we got out of it it was nice
19:30 for a while but we get this president
19:33 and we know that the world is completely
19:34 upside-down but this guy was on Alex
19:36 Jones a couple times a president-elect
19:39 and a candidate for presidency had been
19:42 on Alex Jones of all things and believe
19:44 me I'm not the slightest bit delusional
19:48 with what Alex Jones may or may not be a
19:51 lot of people think he's a shill I think
19:53 that's a much strong stronger
19:56 classification a shill is someone who's
19:59 taking money someone who's really you
20:01 know going to meetings and figuring out
20:03 what he's supposed to say and how he's
20:05 supposed to manipulate everything love
20:08 him or hate him he's a genius he has a
20:11 memory that just won't stop I honestly
20:14 think I've got a pretty amazing memory
20:16 but the more I see him do you know fly
20:19 off the cuff live that guy has a memory
20:21 perhaps two or three times more intense
20:23 than my own well they're not what he
20:24 remembers is true or false you know
20:26 we're all trying to do our best on these
20:27 shows I think he has a lot of young
20:30 people working for him that really do
20:32 care and are really trying to say the
20:34 truth I do think that the only time I've
20:38 ever seen them really fake evidence it
20:41 appeared as if they were faking evidence
20:43 was when they were in Half Moon Bay
20:44 trying to measure radiation coming in
20:46 Fukushima they were putting a wand on
20:49 sand and the guy who did this is gone
20:51 from the show by the way and you saw a
20:53 little hand point on the ground it looks
20:56 like they buried something that was
20:57 giving a reading and so they went over
20:59 right where the hand was boom and saying
21:02 you know readings you know when it's a
21:06 metal detector you dig it up what the
21:08 hell is causing this big reading what's
21:12 coming in from Fukushima it would have
21:13 been an ambient increase in radiation
21:16 not some focal point of radiation so
21:21 that's the only thing I've ever seen him
21:22 do that seemed really walki but again
21:23 all the people that did that or history
21:25 so probably you know the procedure would
21:27 be get rid of the people don't admit you
21:29 did it
21:29 let it blow over you know I can do it
21:32 again but our president before he was
21:35 president and before after he was
21:37 elected when on that show and that's a
21:39 really interesting turn of events
21:42 do we really have a president that has
21:44 seen all of the stuff that Alex Jones
21:46 talks about you know if alex is a shill
21:50 it's only because it's not because he's
21:52 getting paid or anything it's because
21:53 he's gullible to things and he's over
21:55 emotional in kilcher radio the show
21:57 always talked about if you watch season
21:58 1 you'll hear me reference it all the
22:00 time that show was created because of
22:02 Alex Jones being so negative and so
22:06 inaccessible to your relatives and your
22:08 friends you couldn't get any information
22:10 without being utterly embarrassed to
22:12 pass along the the link he's calmed down
22:14 a little bit but I think he's getting
22:16 more crazy again here in 2018 god bless
22:19 him I wish him the best if he finds his
22:22 way certainly hurting for viewers I
22:27 think it hard he's a good man
22:29 but so then Donald Trump becomes
22:32 president and he no longer goes to Alex
22:34 Jones his show okay so we're wondering
22:38 did he use us did use us to get votes
22:41 did he get the truth or movement they
22:43 awakened group of folks on the Internet
22:45 does he use us to get support to give us
22:47 hope or is he the real deal now right
22:51 away we know he's a businessman so we
22:54 know that the one element the one talent
22:56 that just absolutely does not exist on
22:58 the hill our business people business
23:01 women and business men they don't exist
23:03 the only ones that exist up there and
23:05 the business of politics business of as
23:06 Greg I was at trey gowdy said of winning
23:12 trey gowdy is dropping out of his next
23:15 term because he's like I'm tired of just
23:17 living to win my next election because I
23:20 want to actually enforce the law
23:21 let's those dearly hope he doesn't let
23:23 us down he's still defending the Russian
23:26 investigation but maybe he's trying to
23:30 put it to bed in a very efficient way
23:32 we're not sure but here's what's
23:33 interesting the president goes in the
23:35 beginning of last year 2017 and he is
23:41 he is breaking records there's no real
23:44 Guinness Book of World Records for world
23:46 leaders but if there were awards for
23:51 especially that within a designated
23:53 century Donald Trump has done more in
23:56 his first 365 days than any leader I am
24:00 aware of on earth even going back to
24:04 Kennedy this dude is getting stuff done
24:07 in a big way and it's huge he's
24:13 delivering on his promises now does he
24:15 is he does he have the capability
24:17 delivering on absolutely every molecule
24:19 of everything he said the exact way that
24:21 he said he was going to do it
24:23 no because he wasn't inside yet so he
24:28 doesn't know exactly all the obstacles
24:29 but he had really good advisers I'll say
24:32 this much because the sheer percentage
24:34 of what he's been able to do has been
24:35 huge we make you cringe yeah you know
24:41 when he gives himself credit at the
24:42 podium that's the thing that makes me
24:44 kind of cringe I wish he'd stopped that
24:46 I've worked with a lot of comedians in
24:48 my lifetime and the one thing I always
24:49 tell my comedians is if you laugh at
24:51 your own joke on stage and you're
24:53 stealing the thunder from your joke from
24:58 the audience because you're already
25:00 laughing at it let them laugh at it
25:02 Donald Trump needs to let us give him
25:04 all of his alkyl aids and not you know
25:08 ask an audience to give him an extra
25:11 applause at one particular point at the
25:13 podium his recent speech in Philadelphia
25:16 was probably one of the most masterful
25:19 speeches I've ever seen in my life and
25:20 it would have been the March 2018 speech
25:24 in Philadelphia early March I want to
25:28 say the guy's name that he was
25:28 supporting he didn't you didn't actually
25:30 make it but that speech if I were to
25:32 ever give a speech as effective and as
25:37 multi-dimensional as that speech you
25:38 talk about 4d chess or 3d chess this
25:41 dudes playing 4d chess and that speech
25:43 you know I have talked for hundreds of
25:48 hours on this show I will tell you that
25:49 there's not a single show that remotely
25:51 comes close to the perfection of that
25:53 speech
25:54 he addresses so much of the Yaquis so
25:57 many of the accusations I should say
25:58 that he was accused of he talks about
26:02 and parodies this notion that he's not
26:06 acting presidential it's it's utterly
26:09 brilliant from start to finish but we
26:14 want to know that he's still serving the
26:17 under belly of the whole thing now we
26:21 all know the deep state exists nowadays
26:24 if you don't know the deep state exists
26:26 then you probably don't know who q and
26:27 on is you probably the mass media is the
26:29 best place to get your information all
26:31 right
26:31 the deep state is the tip of the pyramid
26:34 it is the end of the hallway it is the
26:38 emergency doors down there
26:39 it's ICU there are the people poisoning
26:42 you tearing you apart trying to make you
26:45 look over here while they stick it to
26:46 you over here they have their minions
26:50 they have their minions in military
26:52 their Millions and all the three-letter
26:54 alphabet agencies just a few they just
26:57 need a few at the tip of every single
26:59 pyramid structure that they're in every
27:00 compartmentalized intelligence agency
27:02 around the world is infested with deep
27:06 state agents was an operation
27:08 Mockingbird a project Mockingbird out of
27:10 the 50s where they made the decision
27:12 openly to infiltrate all the press Rod
27:17 Serling in his 1959 speech on the
27:19 internet look up Rod Serling interview
27:21 he's the inventor of Twilight Zone he
27:23 talked about pre censorship he was
27:26 essentially giving you his description
27:29 of this process get people so stupid
27:32 they believe what they're saying you're
27:35 Rachel Maddow is right some of these
27:37 people simply know whether you know
27:40 where their bread is buttered they're
27:42 sociopathic bizarre people was the
27:45 Stephen Colbert I guess he's
27:48 okay-looking I think he's lived a fairly
27:52 bizarre life he finally found his his
27:58 sort of in doing these side bits to the
28:02 Comedy Central show and then he got the
28:06 show as the host
28:07 and he has lost his mind he can't see
28:12 anything because he is one of these
28:13 candidates that Rod Serling talked about
28:16 he's pre censored he has a
28:18 predisposition to believe [ __ ] the
28:21 Chunin starts posting last October late
28:23 October I believe I think it could be
28:28 slightly earlier but he starts making
28:29 predictions about indictments the day
28:31 that individuals will be indicted and he
28:33 does it almost a month beforehand and
28:35 POW right on those days the indictments
28:38 go out who would know such a thing
28:41 there's a lot of theories that Cuban on
28:44 is Donald Trump but I don't think that's
28:46 true why don't I think that's true the
28:49 main reason is is that whoever is Cuban
28:51 on whether they be a single person or
28:54 multiple individuals they talk in very
28:56 intense off you skated code they use
29:01 military Intel jargon they use it so
29:04 fluently that it seems like it would
29:09 take a whole career in this Intel talk
29:14 to be able to fluently construct the off
29:17 you skated truth there an in all of his
29:20 posts again I'm gonna call Cuban on he
29:23 and him but it's just a you know just a
29:27 metaphorical reference at this point we
29:28 don't know it seems as though Donald
29:31 Trump has acknowledged cue in several
29:33 different ways some of the looser ones
29:37 is that Donald Trump waved his hand it
29:39 what looked like a cue I thought that
29:41 was insane until I saw it I was like wow
29:43 that really is a cue if you just traced
29:45 it with light I mean he does a Q and a
29:47 little curly at the bottom it could just
29:50 be a hand gesture you think you'd have
29:52 to practice such a thing
29:55 someone told the president I believe it
29:57 was in a cue is definitely a cue
29:59 throughout I'm not sure it was by cue
30:00 but they told President Trump to put 18
30:02 spaces in his next tweet and I believe
30:05 it was his tweet wishing everyone a
30:07 happy holidays that there were a bunch
30:11 of weird spaces in his tweet counted up
30:14 there were 18
30:16 there was a photo op at the White House
30:20 I believe where Donald Trump was holding
30:22 a list of things in his hand with both
30:23 of his hands and the very last one was
30:26 number five and it said we hear you now
30:30 he could be speaking on behalf of the Q
30:32 team to the public or he could be
30:34 speaking directly q and whoever that
30:36 team is saying we hear you Q it would
30:40 seem as if Q and the president are
30:42 connected whether or not the president
30:44 is aware of his or her identity or their
30:47 identity they're working together but
30:50 here is where Q starts to create a
30:55 stream of messages from October last
30:59 year 2017 till president which is March
31:02 of 2018 he creates a stream of messages
31:07 that starts to reveal with the
31:11 administration behind Trump and what
31:13 Trump is doing behind the scenes so you
31:17 can keep yourself very busy with the
31:18 things that Trump is doing on the
31:20 outside he's negotiating with kim
31:21 jeong-hoon he's working on the wall he's
31:24 working on tariffs he's working on
31:25 sanctions he's trying to kick all these
31:28 illegal ms-13 guys out of the place he's
31:31 coming down on sanctuary cities and
31:33 states that are trying to break the
31:34 Constitution the House of illegal
31:36 immigrants all Acosta he is a busy bee
31:39 right and there's always a infinite
31:43 supply of women that accuse him of
31:44 things and it goes for a couple weeks or
31:46 a couple months and they always pull out
31:48 at the end say yeah he didn't really do
31:50 anything with me at all he just talked
31:51 to me to his business latest one being
31:53 Starmie daniels who now we have a text
31:56 message from her that says I met with
31:59 Trump it was strictly a business meeting
32:00 done now what's fascinating about that
32:03 whole thing is that you know even if
32:08 everything stormy Daniels is saying it's
32:10 consensual sex
32:11 unlike Bill Clinton who seems to be
32:14 accused of almost 30 women 27 I think
32:18 all saying they were raped in one shape
32:22 or another they were that he exposed his
32:23 junk to them all this other stuff
32:25 unsolicited but like Bill Cosby
32:28 so we're not dealing with a criminal
32:30 here with Donald Trump we're just
32:33 dealing with the playa but q and on has
32:35 the theme and his theme is really
32:39 buttoned up with sort of a single phrase
32:44 which is what is wrong with the world is
32:47 so wrong that there isn't a population
32:51 in the world that can hear about what
32:53 has actually been going wrong for so
32:55 many decades that won't be utterly
32:58 shocked and terrified at the things that
33:01 have gone wrong and it usually centers
33:05 around two things one all of the
33:10 political business scandals of the
33:12 former leaders of this country of the
33:14 United States of America and it implies
33:16 and links out to a lot of folks in other
33:19 countries but I'm telling you I think we
33:21 have the lion's share of them here
33:23 uranium one you know this this company
33:26 that is in Canada called uranium one
33:29 that is granted through the State
33:30 Department using a pay-for-play model
33:33 right someone gave the Hilary Foundation
33:35 a bunch of money she runs through and
33:37 grants this sale of twenty three twenty
33:39 five percent of all the uranium the
33:40 United States is acquired to this
33:42 company which is later than sold to the
33:44 Russians and is now owned by Vladimir
33:46 Putin fusion GPS this fake dossier this
33:50 fake report that was written on Trump
33:52 that was used to gain illegal FISA
33:55 warrants sedition and treason at its
34:00 highest level these are these are
34:03 offenses that are so bad that the death
34:06 penalty is one of the punishments that
34:11 the military tribunal that supposedly
34:14 coming can ask for and be granted but at
34:19 least life from prison there's an easy
34:22 one with these people the stealing of
34:25 Moammar Qaddafi's gold and weapons the
34:27 weapons being laundered through benghazi
34:29 over to isis all the gold and silver
34:31 being stolen by Clinton and the Clinton
34:35 family and the Obama family and most
34:37 likely a lot of other players at the
34:39 Royal Bank level
34:42 evidence is coming out as well the human
34:45 trafficking there's two sides of this
34:47 equation but on the political side of it
34:49 there's human trafficking that has now
34:50 come about as a result of the falling of
34:53 Libya all the captured people that tried
34:57 to fight for Libya or fight against
35:00 Libya have now been captured and they're
35:02 being sold you could buy a black man I
35:03 read online a name in a mass media
35:06 article a black man can now be bought in
35:09 Libya for $800 I've seen the videos of
35:13 them and the camps being prepared to be
35:15 sold the Clinton Foundation gets
35:20 involved with Haiti which I believe had
35:23 the hurricane of the earthquake whatever
35:25 was that devastated that country they
35:28 gathered over two billion dollars in aid
35:29 and kept it all they'd do a thing they
35:31 built like six houses down there the
35:36 leaders down there related to the rescue
35:38 effort were caught with I think forty
35:41 children trying to exit the country all
35:44 these abandoned kids were rounded up to
35:46 be sold off and that's what we cross
35:49 over into the other half of what q non
35:51 has been talking about and those of you
35:53 who have been awake for over a decade
35:54 will know all about this and I've talked
35:57 about this in my st. episode my lead
36:00 pedophilia episode it's where we get
36:03 into the Podesta family
36:04 Tony Podesta Tony Podesta who has art
36:08 made out of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims a
36:10 gold statue made out of one of the
36:13 beheaded victims of Jeffrey Dahmer and
36:15 it hangs in his house I'll show you the
36:18 picture in case you doubt me
36:23 sickos man pictures of little girls and
36:27 all kinds of different paintings
36:30 protecting their buttocks and their
36:32 genitals they'll bring little pennies
36:35 but pretty much right around the area of
36:38 their body where you have usually
36:42 consensual sexual adult activity they
36:45 are obviously children and they are all
36:49 discolored their skin is discolored
36:51 around their clothing this is the the
36:57 art collection that Tony Podesta has all
36:59 over his house or at least had all over
37:02 his house that the Washington Post I
37:04 believe in 2006 ran an article on and
37:07 said look how great this man is look how
37:09 look at what an artist he is no one's
37:12 heard from that guy for a while we think
37:13 he was arrested on the flight to Japan
37:15 they turned it around and parked it a
37:17 Hawaii twice got him off there everyone
37:21 on the plane was supposedly sworn to
37:23 secrecy haven't seen much of John McCain
37:26 recently he's about to come out with
37:27 this scathing book on the White House of
37:30 course John McCain the guy who's
37:33 supposedly the powa war hero from
37:36 Vietnam he gets caught his plane goes
37:41 down his father's name Navy admiral mr.
37:45 McCain gave away everything within
37:48 seconds of being captured now I'm sure
37:50 they tortured the [ __ ] out of them and
37:51 maybe we would all do the same I'm not
37:54 sure he has physical problems to this
37:58 day because of what happened to him they
38:00 got everything out of him videotaped it
38:01 sent it over to the White House of which
38:04 the White House said what should we do
38:07 with him his father the rumors of his
38:10 father said well if he's he's destined
38:12 to be a politician so if he ever comes
38:14 out as a traitor and a secret spewer
38:19 then he's never gonna be in politics so
38:21 you hang on to him and so I kept him for
38:23 I believe eight eleven months but all
38:25 those confessions which are supposed to
38:28 be in the low 40s are sitting in the
38:31 Library of Congress sealed and or
38:33 whatever they keep those documents and
38:35 why every single time at powr mi a
38:37 investigation came through it came
38:41 through
38:42 McCain's desk and Matane McCain refused
38:45 to allow a lot of families to look at
38:46 the records because his records are
38:48 right next to theirs and someone could
38:50 accidentally open his box and realize
38:52 he's a traitor I've seen videos with
38:54 senators both retired and acting
38:58 senators talking about this whole thing
39:00 saying how much of a traitor he was well
39:04 what qa9 continues to talk about pretty
39:08 much goes like this
39:10 Trump gets into office because of not
39:15 just a random decision to run for
39:17 presidency but according to q and on
39:20 members of the NSA which is a Military
39:23 Intelligence Agency which does gather
39:25 all of our information but unlike other
39:29 alphabet agencies they just hang on to
39:32 it in a vault in case there's a file
39:34 Orange that is granted if a FISA warrant
39:36 is granted freedom something like
39:40 Freedom of Information Surveillance Act
39:41 or some weird [ __ ] they can go into the
39:44 NSA database plug in your data and find
39:47 out what you have been doing but they
39:49 have to get a warrant to do it alphabet
39:51 agencies don't wait for the warrants
39:53 they just go get it or they have their
39:56 own access to that data their own copy
39:58 of the data there's a bunch of companies
40:00 like I've said recently and I just said
40:02 at one of my episodes I apologize for
40:04 repeating myself but your data is stolen
40:07 at the router level okay and there's a
40:09 company called Cisco that is the
40:13 alphabet agencies version of this
40:15 technology and so a copy is always given
40:18 to them and then they could do what they
40:20 want with it goes to the NSA goes to
40:21 various other collection agencies it's
40:26 decrypted immediately there's nothing
40:28 you're doing that's hiding in anyone's
40:30 phone or hiding in someone's database if
40:32 you've been told you have encryption you
40:35 don't okay the operating system
40:39 companies like Apple and Microsoft and
40:42 Google are all putting their data
40:44 centers right next to NSA data centers
40:46 it's part of the military commissions
40:47 Act
40:48 we'll help you if you help us right but
40:52 then q and on very quickly reveals a
40:55 couple things he says that the NSA
40:56 leaders actually approached Donald Trump
40:58 on the outside and said there's
41:00 something really wrong going on here a
41:02 plan a 16 year plan to turn over America
41:06 to the communist socialist party that
41:09 will be the European Union once they get
41:12 done with all their phases of transition
41:14 this is obviously before Breck's had
41:16 happened this is obviously before
41:18 countries like Italy are starting to
41:20 rethink this whole thing a lot of
41:22 countries are rethinking this whole
41:24 thing okay
41:26 but they said Obama was the first eight
41:28 years and Hillary was to be the last
41:30 eight years I'm just repeating what cue
41:32 a nun said he says that they solicited
41:36 Donald Trump and said you always said
41:37 you would run if there was no other kind
41:39 of it better than you and we can't think
41:40 of a better candidate than you the deal
41:43 is this will protect you physically and
41:46 we will protect the American vote at the
41:49 same time we will get information leaked
41:52 out that will start revealing this cabal
41:55 in a way that the public can digest it
41:57 so not the whole plan not even the fact
41:59 there is a coup going on but we'll start
42:01 to show where these individuals have
42:03 been very nefarious in their deeds well
42:07 Trump has already had his own plan to
42:09 bring America back to the way it was
42:11 when he was a kid with the American
42:14 dream actually lives and breathe is in
42:16 every single person who could get them
42:18 sauce over here legally or who were born
42:19 here but what I thought was very
42:22 interesting was that within this package
42:24 of things that are wrong this coup we've
42:27 got to stop the coup which is Hillary
42:29 Clinton becoming president but we also
42:32 have to expose the underbelly of all the
42:34 horrible things that they're doing
42:35 because children are getting sold and
42:39 bought bought and sold by these elite
42:42 pedophilia 's the Lolita Island right
42:47 are we talking about this recently it's
42:50 an Ireland that has been purchased and
42:52 and designed by the founder of the Home
42:54 Shopping Network his name always escapes
42:56 me I apologize but the Clintons were big
42:59 fans of this place especially Bill
43:02 almost goes over 30 times holds back the
43:04 secret service the five or six times
43:06 shows up at parties with young girls on
43:08 his shoulders so claiming that there is
43:10 nephews
43:10 there's nieces excuse me maybe some
43:13 nephews do we don't have a fairly
43:15 substantial rumor that Anthony Weiner's
43:19 computer has a video of Hillary Clinton
43:21 engaging in a sexual act with a minor
43:24 not sure where and when how but the LAPD
43:27 people internally have said we've seen
43:29 it it exists and we're not allowed to
43:31 release it yet this is how dark it is
43:34 within their chambers according to cue
43:37 UNAM what's really gone on has been so
43:40 monumentally larger than that that
43:44 everyone's going to be shocked and
43:46 appalled and so the president united
43:48 states has the has a couple options here
43:50 you can go full nuclear and release
43:53 everything and simply say deal with it
43:57 but he knows that when you reveal that
44:00 sort of information you lose a lot of
44:03 credibility about the ability of your
44:05 country to protect you to serve and
44:07 protect you which is their Charter so
44:10 cue and honest said look there's a
44:13 charge that we can get all these people
44:14 inside of a big net so that we get
44:16 everyone inside of and it's called human
44:18 trafficking within the core of that
44:21 charge will exist the violations of
44:25 pedophilia because what would be the end
44:28 purpose of someone's human trafficking
44:30 besides sex sure maybe a poor black man
44:34 in Libya is being sold for actual labor
44:37 but a child is not being sold for labor
44:40 they're being sold for sex as I've said
44:44 on this show some of the more appalling
44:48 things that we have had revealed by some
44:50 very deep sources especially in England
44:55 especially through Jimmy Savile well the
44:58 world's largest pedophilia individuals
45:02 who managed to die without serving any
45:04 time who brought a lot of children
45:07 supposedly into the royal family I don't
45:09 have any evidence of that personally I'm
45:10 just repeating what I've heard okay
45:12 child sacrifices are a part of the game
45:15 and the sacrifice has a lot of other
45:19 byproducts and activities that go on
45:21 after the child is no longer with us
45:23 that I will leave out of this episode
45:25 you'll have to research it for yourself
45:26 or watch my old episodes but what if you
45:29 wanted to bring all these people to
45:30 justice how would you do it they've
45:33 obviously hid their tracks really really
45:34 well and they have a lot of people like
45:36 Muller at the top we'll continue
45:38 assisting and hiding all the evidence
45:41 right Mueller's whole group at the FBI
45:44 is all staunch trump haters there's two
45:49 reasons why you hate Trump right you're
45:52 either totally misinformed child who
45:53 hasn't had your own business you don't
45:55 know anything about America before 9/11
45:57 and so you're able to believe anything
45:59 that you're told you go out and do a
46:00 parade and you when the microphone comes
46:03 to you you just spit on the guy because
46:05 you have nothing to say the second group
46:08 of people who hate Trump are people that
46:12 are in on the crimes we're trying to
46:14 keep them hidden there's several other
46:18 groups but those are the two main ones
46:19 right I have a strong belief that people
46:22 who hate Authority also hate him too
46:26 anyone says that the game is over the
46:31 jig is up they hate him they like any
46:35 option that they want in life including
46:37 pedophilia and I forgot to mention that
46:40 the John Podesta Tony's brother ran
46:42 Hillary's campaign okay this is how this
46:46 is how tightly knit these individuals
46:48 are to each other now I'm not saying
46:50 that everyone involved in protecting the
46:53 coup has anything to do with this
46:56 horrific layer of crime they simply may
47:00 have known about it and looked the other
47:01 way because they had no choice maybe
47:03 they were threatened themselves and now
47:05 they feel like oh my God if I don't get
47:06 immunity to tell the truth but I'm gonna
47:10 go away potentially to an electric chair
47:11 I'll find out what get Mo's all about
47:14 right Guantanamo Bay but you have two
47:16 ways of trying someone in the United
47:18 States of America you have trial by jury
47:21 and you have a military tribunal what's
47:26 the difference why would you be tried in
47:28 one versus the other
47:30 well an average citizen like you and I
47:33 who commits a crime of any kind can at
47:37 certain points of escalation get it to a
47:39 jury trial
47:40 how did jury trials work I mean how many
47:43 times have you watched this on TV on
47:45 Hill Street Blues are all the other CSIS
47:47 they're NCIS stuff a group of citizens
47:51 are brought in a lot of you have done
47:52 jury duty
47:52 you're interviewed you're selected
47:55 there's backup jurors you have to sit
47:58 there the whole time guess one of them
48:00 drops out for their vote but they get
48:03 killed don't they
48:06 they're manipulated into like chills are
48:10 manipulated into the jury such that
48:11 they're already gonna go in and vote for
48:14 the guilty party for money or maybe due
48:16 to a threat so trial by jury for these
48:19 deep Staters is a real risk to the
48:22 national security of the individuals
48:24 that have to serve on these trials they
48:26 would have to sit inside of a bunker
48:28 pretty much the entire time that they
48:30 are on these trials which might last a
48:33 very long time if you don't have the
48:37 right evidence now imagine that this
48:40 rumor about anthony weiner's computer
48:44 having a video of Hillary Clinton with a
48:46 minor is actually true and let's just
48:48 say that the government the Department
48:51 of Justice or the NSA or the
48:52 administration has a copy of this video
48:54 well out of all the people they want to
48:57 bring down Hillary Clinton would be done
48:58 they don't need to worry about gaining
49:00 another piece of evidence on her that
49:02 one is in jail that one is up for the
49:05 death penalty but there's a lot more
49:08 people that need to go down because
49:09 simply taking her out it's not going to
49:10 take them all out maybe bill needs to go
49:13 down maybe everyone needs to go down so
49:16 they sit and they comb through
49:18 information they use real FISA
49:22 applications to dig inside the NSA to
49:24 find out what's going on there isn't a
49:27 single email that went to Hillary
49:28 Clinton's secret server that wasn't
49:31 caught by the NSA I assure you of this I
49:34 assure you we don't need any of her
49:36 bleached drives to be unbleached to know
49:38 exactly what she did because why it all
49:41 went through routers
49:43 once it went through a router it was
49:45 copied no one seems to be asking the
49:47 question of why do you create a secret
49:49 server in the first place you create a
49:51 secret server because you are committing
49:53 crimes you don't need a secret server
49:56 unless you're committing crimes it is
50:00 obviously not going to be as secure as
50:02 what the security agencies that protect
50:05 our national security communications
50:08 would be able to provide so you're never
50:10 going to ever eclipse that natural
50:12 protection you get as being some sort of
50:14 officer of the government so you pull it
50:16 outside because you're going to be
50:18 taking pay-for-play donations into your
50:20 fund and to the Clinton Foundation to
50:24 determine who gets what where and when
50:27 but everything that the State Department
50:29 actually comes up with it is of any
50:31 significant nature has to be
50:33 double-checked by the administration and
50:35 voted on by the President of the United
50:36 States
50:37 so everything that Hillary Clinton does
50:39 has to be then blessed by Barack Obama
50:42 satoru mr. Barry satoru right so
50:46 according to q anon they have been
50:50 building the case Jeff Sessions who's
50:52 taken a lot of hits because he hasn't
50:54 been that vocal his nickname in his
50:59 career as the silent assassin he watches
51:06 you he gives you all the rope you need
51:07 to hang yourself he builds a case that
51:11 is ironclad and then you're dead and I
51:16 don't mean that probably physically I
51:18 just mean in the legal sense of your
51:20 freedom it's gone and it's gone forever
51:22 but military tribunals are a lot
51:25 different than jury trials aren't they
51:27 there is no jury there are individuals
51:31 who were trained in law to the nines
51:34 they get to focus their less emotional
51:37 and they get to simply study the facts
51:40 find out whether or not the facts are
51:43 truly facts or not there's legal
51:45 representation for those that are being
51:47 accused but once your verdict comes down
51:51 the verdict comes down and what they can
51:53 do to you after military tribunal is
51:56 absolute they can hand out a sentence of
51:59 death and that's it I'm not even sure
52:03 there's an appeal process you protects
52:07 the citizens of the United States and it
52:10 gets a bunch of people off the street
52:12 right a bunch of bad people off the
52:14 street as of this recording Hillary
52:18 Clinton is in India and Barack Obama's
52:21 in Japan now maybe they come back after
52:23 this recording but what's happened with
52:25 Hillary Clinton in India well she's
52:28 dying for one thing she's got some
52:29 serious serious problems with their
52:32 health we're not exactly sure what they
52:35 said that on was the September 11 2016
52:37 she actually died as a result of getting
52:40 in that van she was even reported that
52:43 she died and that they rehabilitated her
52:45 at her daughter's house they amazed to
52:47 clean her up because she lost all of her
52:49 body functions as well we've seen her
52:52 doing this whooping cough on on-camera
52:54 she just she just did it recently
52:57 she's got major health problems she
53:01 supposedly felt down in India and broke
53:03 a wrist
53:03 we saw her having a terrible time going
53:06 down this set of stairs in India
53:08 well everyone around her was having no
53:09 problem which means there's motor motor
53:12 neuron problems there's probably a
53:13 nervous system problem that's wrong with
53:16 her but the story is the cover story is
53:18 because she broke her wrist she
53:21 shouldn't travel which is why she's
53:23 staying in India okay rock obama well
53:29 he's been traveling the world hasn't he
53:30 he can still travel to other countries
53:33 he just happens to be in a country that
53:35 is an extreme ally of the United States
53:37 of America so I'm not sure I buy the the
53:40 escape routine for him but he's not in
53:41 this country right now I'm I try to get
53:45 this episode out as quickly as possible
53:47 before the weekend because cue Iran
53:50 keeps dropping these posts according to
53:54 cues most recent posts in the last two
53:56 weeks the stage is set meaning all the
53:59 evidence that they need has been
54:02 acquired to at least make the first
54:05 round of the gigantic changes in this
54:07 country
54:08 and believe me when it starts happening
54:10 over here it'll start happening over in
54:12 Europe there's even been people detained
54:15 already related to these scams but now
54:19 you don't hear about any of this and the
54:21 mass media do you not even the ones
54:25 they're the top-rated Fox News at this
54:26 point right they get the least amount of
54:29 insults from the president nine states
54:31 as being fake news and I would say that
54:34 they're not necessarily as fake as the
54:36 other news but what they do to sort of
54:39 stay in the clear is they just simply
54:42 don't cover a lot of news that they
54:44 should cover q and on should be a
54:46 front-page story on any news rag any
54:50 even if they as they have recently tried
54:53 to accuse this character of being a
54:55 complete fake a LARP a live-action
54:58 role-playing exercise q and on keeps
55:01 telling us to buckle up and brace for
55:03 impact that what's going to happen is
55:06 going to be swift and huge and below the
55:09 minds of pretty much everyone on this
55:11 planet
55:11 those remotely awake to the wave we've
55:14 been running this planet for probably
55:15 the last seven decades maybe even more I
55:20 will say this much if he's if he is a
55:22 real guy a real person a real group of
55:26 people and they get their way they'll
55:30 still be plenty of stuff to clean up of
55:31 course we have a very dumb down society
55:35 that needs to become extremely educated
55:37 we have a bunch of people that believe
55:39 in the false paradigms of left and right
55:41 that will get educated
55:43 we have people who believe
55:44 wholeheartedly everything that they're
55:46 told who will be educated the beautiful
55:51 thing is if this is true this D cooing
55:55 of the United States of America then all
55:57 the other countries in Europe can DQ a
55:59 lot of interesting interesting facts
56:02 that Q is claimed if they are able to be
56:06 proven will so shocked the world that
56:10 it'll be interesting that we will
56:12 probably walk around in two days for no
56:14 less than a decade looking back on
56:17 everything we've ever been told sort of
56:19 that Luke I'm your father moment right
56:22 I'll give you an example of something
56:24 that Q has revealed a little tidbit that
56:28 might blow your mind if it's true
56:29 certainly will blow mine let me tell you
56:31 so at the end of World War two
56:35 Berlin is is rated by half Russian and
56:40 half American forces the bunker in which
56:45 Hitler was staying in I believe was
56:47 rated by the jerker by the Russians
56:49 excuse me they supposedly gave us this
56:53 this photograph of a burned body and
56:56 they said that's a tough Hitler he died
56:58 in this bunker he committed suicide most
57:00 likely before the fire along with all of
57:02 his other upper management
57:04 you know Goering and Goebbels and all
57:08 those guys right but as Jim Marrs
57:11 documented really well on his fourth
57:13 reich book before he passed away and a
57:18 lot of the quips that you will find in
57:20 the world from very intelligent sort of
57:22 people that know they always make the
57:23 joke that they're made it to ardency
57:25 argentina there's a gentleman who's been
57:28 photographed in argentina with very
57:30 validated backgrounds to photographs
57:32 showing a gentleman that looked very
57:34 much like an aging adolf hitler there is
57:39 sort of a code that has been broken in
57:42 the last decade especially with the
57:44 death of Muammar Qaddafi and probably
57:46 Saddam Hussein although the death of him
57:48 looked really hokey that leaders don't
57:51 kill leaders it's sort of this pact that
57:53 they have if you're able to make it to
57:55 the absolute commander-in-chief of your
57:57 country you sort of join this little
57:58 cabal whether or not you're actually
58:01 obeying what everyone wants you to do
58:03 they typically don't kill you they haul
58:05 you off somewhere in hide you but
58:07 knowing how we smuggle so many Germans
58:09 over here to the United States of
58:10 America through Operation Paperclip
58:11 thanks to the Dulles brothers half of
58:13 them turning into the CIA and the other
58:15 half turning into NASA with von Braun
58:19 leading our moon mission supposedly I
58:23 mean he did he let it but many of us
58:27 think we didn't make it
58:29 Hitler would have continued living and
58:34 in 1954 when Angela Merkel was born q
58:39 and on has said unequivocally that
58:41 Angela Merkel is the daughter of Adolf
58:45 Hitler now when you compare photographs
58:48 to the two of them it is stunning it is
58:51 so stunning right we all know what that
58:54 looks like when you compare yourself
58:55 with your child or your buddies kids
58:57 you're like oh my god he didn't share
58:59 any DNA look they all look like him or
59:01 the opposite they look like they look
59:02 like the mom but sometimes there are a
59:04 good combination of the two who knows
59:06 now Germans look very similar in some
59:09 cases like Americans like Japanese like
59:11 Chinese like all of us right it could be
59:13 a farce but imagine if she was and it
59:17 could be revealed once this whole thing
59:19 goes down the genetic records the hidden
59:22 records within the bowels of the United
59:23 States of America which are no longer a
59:25 matter of national security right if we
59:27 knew that he got away to Argentina the
59:29 only reason why we would hide that
59:30 information is to keep the facade of
59:33 revised history going which we know runs
59:36 rampant around the world
59:38 the victors write the history books
59:40 right but imagine that the European
59:44 Union is being run by the daughter of
59:46 what is considered to be one of the most
59:48 evil men to ever live because of the
59:50 revised history of world war two and if
59:54 you have a problem swallowing that red
59:55 pill it depends on how old you are and
59:58 how observant you were during the 90s
59:59 after the Gulf War with Saddam Hussein I
60:03 have seen the documentary I think on the
60:06 History Channel with Dick Cheney talking
60:09 about how they lied about the Saddam
60:11 family this Hussein family excuse me
60:14 lied about his kids being these killers
60:16 when they were young I think one of the
60:18 oldest ones was seem to behave like a
60:21 nut bag but again I'm just getting my
60:24 press and my information through these
60:25 arteries that are controlled by what six
60:27 corporations it's important to remember
60:29 that Reuters bought ap in 2004 okay and
60:33 almost every international article in
60:35 the world is either credited to Reuters
60:36 or ap what would that do to the EU I
60:40 think a lot
60:42 what would it do to everyone who could
60:44 be proven to have known this information
60:46 they'll claim ignorance of course cubed
60:50 on has said that Barack Obama if he is
60:54 ever charged will use his Kenya
60:56 citizenship his Kenya birthplace to
61:01 prove that he was not a United States
61:02 citizen the entire time and that he
61:05 might use that to get away from charges
61:09 seems a little crazy but I want to share
61:11 it all warts and all and for those of
61:16 you who are wondering how the process
61:17 works how does this guy share his
61:19 information how do we know it's truly
61:20 this guy
61:22 well these a Chan it's 8 number 8 CH com
61:29 I think it's slash Great Awakening is
61:32 his channel but he kind of comes and
61:34 goes in different forums he will do a
61:36 few test posts to make sure that his
61:38 socket is really clean and because he
61:40 posts strictly in text messages he could
61:42 use a burner phone he could go to Target
61:44 and grab a phone and just with it with a
61:47 flip phone and just texting he could
61:49 just push it up there take the phone
61:51 destroy it it has no source wow you
61:54 figured out it came from my target big
61:56 deal you could have the target phone
61:58 bought here in California and shipped
61:59 all the way to some other part of the
62:01 country but they will figure out what
62:03 cell tower it was working through works
62:04 through proxy servers which is a him
62:06 talking to a server that talks to a
62:08 server and it could do that fifty to a
62:09 hundred times tracing it back it is
62:12 really tough because proxy servers
62:13 typically have their logs turned off and
62:15 so they don't record any source of where
62:17 the message has come from it's the point
62:19 of the game the information is being
62:21 caught okay so when you have a Hillary
62:25 message going through there's a header
62:26 of who the message is to and from that's
62:30 why we've got those emails the cryptic
62:32 nature of Q and ons posts have two
62:34 purposes one I missed last time I spoke
62:37 about it done a lot more research on
62:39 this since that last mention which was a
62:42 brief mention on the previous episodes
62:43 there believe in legislating legislative
62:47 beliefs one he's using cryptic messages
62:50 to sort of scapegoat around the bots
62:53 that automatically harvest certain key
62:56 it's and so he'll never use usually
62:58 proper nouns you use acronyms now they
63:01 can add those acronyms to the search
63:04 mechanism to find them but for a while
63:07 there
63:07 he's completely moving around all of the
63:10 natural mechanisms by which information
63:12 is harvested too I think he understands
63:17 that to simply spell it all out is to
63:21 give society one more sort of I'll do
63:26 all the work for you situation but
63:30 there's a caveat with the information
63:32 he's sharing isn't there it's hard
63:34 information to stomach right he needs
63:39 people to do their research he needs
63:41 people to do the investigation he needs
63:43 people to become aware of these evils so
63:48 that when the actual information comes
63:50 down at least the people that have been
63:52 following cue can be the substrate of
63:54 this society that is ready for that
63:56 information and they can work to and
63:58 inform their relatives and their friends
64:00 in ways that are more accessible to the
64:02 relatives and friends to bring them up
64:04 to date on what's going on I think if
64:08 that is truly the case it is beyond
64:10 brilliant if cue and on is real he is
64:13 nothing short of revolution 2.0 he is
64:18 the Paul Revere he's the gentleman
64:21 saying they're coming they're coming but
64:24 instead of saying they're coming he's
64:27 saying we're taking care of this he's
64:29 also a Minutemen willing to go out and
64:34 fight the Redcoats willing to go out and
64:36 fight the deep state he's not alone he's
64:39 just a messenger according to him less
64:42 than 10 people know who he really is
64:44 again he is this proverbial until we
64:47 know who this person is but here's the
64:49 rub for all the Trump haters if q and on
64:53 is write about even a 50% of what he has
64:56 said the Donald Trump will become known
65:01 as one of the best leaders not by his
65:05 own complete isolated merits okay he
65:08 is a genius at what he does go look at
65:11 the Philadelphia speech it is ingenious
65:14 he knows what he's doing
65:17 everything is a chess move he has baited
65:20 everyone into all kinds of stuff and
65:22 burned them alive when they tried to
65:24 come after him for lies now if Coonan is
65:27 wrong if cue and on turns out to be a
65:30 total LARP a fake
65:35 he's role-playing and none of this
65:38 occurs though things will go on as usual
65:42 oh yeah well probably up a wall probably
65:47 repaired the debt in the United States
65:48 of America but these individuals will be
65:51 able to live full lives without any
65:52 punishment of any kind and I think that
65:55 the reason why I believe that is not the
65:57 case that I believe this is real and I
66:01 believe that agents have finally reached
66:04 a point where they simply cannot stomach
66:06 seeing the data come through anymore
66:08 as once we started surveying the data
66:10 going through people's computers once
66:13 the internet was invented and these
66:14 individuals went from their private
66:16 little parties of taking magazines and
66:19 photographs and people and bringing them
66:22 to other locations to be exploited get
66:25 the rocks off it was all hidden once the
66:31 internet came around they started using
66:32 bulletin boards and private servers to
66:37 pass this information and obviously
66:38 without their knowledge because they're
66:40 not terribly smart people in the first
66:42 place I'm sure some of them are pretty
66:44 smart but they got caught and now you
66:47 have agents looking at things that
66:49 aren't fun anymore it's not looking at a
66:51 guy pork and his wife because he has a
66:53 TV with a camera in it something
66:55 consensual it's something horrific a
66:58 child screaming for help but no one's
67:00 coming and once it started turning out
67:03 to be more than just as JonBenet Ramsey
67:06 father's of the world they started
67:08 turning into our politicians our
67:09 business owners our bankers I think
67:13 things started to change
67:16 they weren't able to look the other way
67:18 they weren't able to sleep at night and
67:21 probably at first it was a few agents to
67:23 saw this and they were probably
67:24 terrified to mention it maybe some did
67:26 whistle blow and got killed and so the
67:28 rest of them fell in line but I think it
67:30 caught up with them I think certain
67:33 alphabet agents are involved and so
67:36 they're able to get into it because
67:38 they'll watch it just to get off but I
67:41 think enough people came around and said
67:46 enough is enough this must stop if we
67:49 can't protect our children who can we
67:53 protect right and sure at first it's
67:56 everyone else's kid at first it's the
67:58 the poor Haitian child who's lost both
68:02 parents due to a storm or earthquake or
68:04 whatever but they know the way the game
68:07 works eventually it will be their child
68:09 I think I said this in my elite
68:11 pedophilia episode and I hate even
68:14 saying this but let me just put a point
68:17 on this before we end the episode just
68:18 so you can understand what we're up
68:20 against here because regardless of cuban
68:23 on Isreal the stuff I'm talking about is
68:25 very real okay let's say you marry well
68:28 you're a woman and you marry a handsome
68:30 man you're a man you marry a beautiful
68:32 woman and you have some of the most
68:34 gorgeous children on planet earth and
68:37 they are sweet and they are wonderful
68:39 they watch the train come in and they
68:42 just simply see magic they do those
68:45 little motivational speeches that go
68:47 viral all over the internet they are
68:49 just the best kids on planet earth and
68:51 they're cute when they do it
68:53 but some scumbag sees it and they are at
68:56 the top of the intelligence agencies
68:58 they can do anything they want they can
69:00 cover up the records of everything that
69:02 they do and they've been doing it ever
69:04 since they got in that upper position of
69:06 power perhaps they came in innocent and
69:09 were converted to evil perhaps they were
69:10 evil and got to that high position
69:12 because that's what they always needed
69:14 perfect protection for their psycho
69:17 minds but let's just say you're nobody
69:20 your kid didn't go viral on the Internet
69:22 but they're still beautiful and you're
69:23 still posting videos or whatever they
69:25 just see your kid at a mall
69:28 there you go you know what I'm gonna
69:29 have that kid that parent has no idea
69:32 what's coming and because I'm in law
69:34 enforcement I'm in military I'm a
69:37 politician of the United States of
69:38 America and I know the people that can
69:40 do this I'll just put a order in I'll
69:44 have you I'll follow you out to your car
69:46 you know these guys these creeps they'll
69:48 follow you out to your car and they'll
69:49 get your license plate which means they
69:51 know where you live and then they just
69:53 find it everything about your whatever
69:55 and your kid ends up on a milk carton
69:58 and you live in this horror of what is
70:03 happening to your child maybe you get
70:05 closure maybe your child is found dead
70:08 at least you have closure whatever's
70:10 happening stopped but so many of these
70:13 kids are never found some of them even
70:15 show back up with their parents
70:16 doorsteps and say yeah this happened to
70:18 me mom everything you could imagine
70:21 happen to me that's why we have to care
70:24 that's why this has to stop that's why
70:27 we have to support anyone and everyone
70:29 willing to sacrifice everything to make
70:31 it stop I usually don't get into this
70:33 you know current topic stuff but at the
70:36 same time we have a saying on this show
70:38 in the previous show which is you got to
70:39 have skin in the game you do got to put
70:44 the information out and you know what
70:45 I've just done a little overview of what
70:47 this guy is done you can find q1 on I
70:49 was at core C dr. Corsi he covers it
70:54 every day every time there's a post drop
70:56 but there are so many kids covering this
71:00 women and men ton of Gen Z's a ton of
71:05 Millennials are covering this and
71:06 they're waking up and they're excited to
71:09 be involved with something real not some
71:13 gun grabbing false flag parade they want
71:19 to be involved in something real that
71:21 makes real changes so I am just a speck
71:24 on this situation
71:28 but I really urge you guys to get
71:30 involved at least become informed right

71:38 lot of different links and analysis if
