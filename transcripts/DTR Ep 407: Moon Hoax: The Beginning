00:28 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen on this beautiful afternoon
00:34 boy it's nice to be on the summertime
00:38 even though it's September September
00:41 13th is the day so you know I've talked
00:45 about the the moon missions for quantum
00:47 quite a while and you guys are gracious
00:51 enough to to watch them to complement
00:55 them and so you know it's a subject that
01:00 fascinates me to death I have the
01:02 conversation at least two or three times
01:03 a week and I don't look for the
01:05 conversation that's the interesting
01:07 thing it seems to happen in my smoke
01:09 lounge a lot and what's kind of funny is
01:15 it's the moon hoax conversation in the
01:19 overall Great Awakening of conspiracies
01:25 which is very dark you know all the real
01:28 dark epstein stuff right the moon is
01:32 like the wacky mirror house at the
01:36 carnival compared to like the super
01:39 duper intense stuff that happens at you
01:41 know major six flags or something and
01:45 you know I just read an article from
01:49 probably several years ago lambaste
01:53 encasing casing was a gentleman who
01:58 worked for one of the subcontractors
02:01 that helped put together the Saturn five
02:04 and all this stuff I believe he was a
02:09 Rocketdyne guy or something like that
02:10 but anyway he was privy to all the
02:13 documentation he was literally told it's
02:15 a one in 10,000 chance this thing could
02:17 ever do what it's said to have done and
02:19 of course it didn't do it so he very
02:22 quickly comes out and spends basically
02:25 40 years going after the truth and he
02:30 knew the truth he was telling everybody
02:32 it was a lie
02:33 intelligent people listened to him
02:38 you know followers grab the tail of NASA
02:41 and just hung on for dear life but
02:43 casing dies in 2005 and the Guardian
02:46 does an article on him and the funny
02:50 thing was they they tried to make people
02:55 feel bad for finding casings rabbit hole
03:00 by saying you were a Fox News enthusiast
03:03 you were an anti-vaxxer you're a flat
03:05 earther I mean it was the most pathetic
03:08 attempt to associate your lucid mind
03:11 with crazy stuff interesting and this
03:19 continues and I think a lot of it is is
03:22 probably in my opinion at this point one
03:25 of the strategies is just you know you
03:27 tell the press just leave it alone just
03:30 leave it alone the more you talk about
03:31 it the more we're gonna lose because we
03:33 didn't go and the amount of scientific
03:36 proof and capability for the average
03:39 engineering student to prove that is now
03:43 categorical meaning absolute they can
03:47 prove we didn't go with basic simulation
03:50 software today you know bart sibrel SI
03:54 bre e l SI bre l comm he has been a
04:02 champion of the truth and he has had to
04:06 pay a gigantic price where they have you
04:11 know then everything that they can to
04:13 keep the guy from being employed in any
04:14 way shape or form now of course this
04:17 does happen over time anyway but if you
04:20 really want to hear a guy talk about it
04:22 straight you know I mean he says look
04:24 he's you know because we're all trying
04:26 to find that smoking gun way of telling
04:28 you that it was a hoax such that no one
04:30 can undo it in your mind but again no
04:36 one is happy that we didn't go okay
04:39 we're not happy at least you know no one
04:41 in my camp is happy we wish it was true
04:43 we wish that we could go to the moon
04:46 ourselves and sit in a space station and
04:48 have a drink
04:51 you know with dr. Chandra but it's the
04:54 first time in world history in world
04:56 history that man has a scientific
04:58 breakthrough and cannot accomplish it
05:01 again for 50 years we go to the moon
05:06 1969 technology with one millionth of
05:09 the computing powder of the average
05:10 crappy cellphone from 15 years ago
05:12 I would suggest that that is a gross
05:18 underestimate of the processor power the
05:23 technology although capable of putting
05:26 someone in low orbit it's it's 200 miles
05:30 up in 1969 that's what low orbit was and
05:34 they said they went 236 237 thousand
05:37 miles up what's the percentage of 200
05:44 from 200,000 let's just put it that way
05:48 it's over a thousand times a lot further
05:52 away again my analogy that I want you to
05:55 remember and repeat to people is if you
05:56 have an eight-foot wall in your house
05:59 and you divide it into metric because
06:01 every centimeter translates pretty well
06:05 to a thousand miles up the ceiling right
06:09 when the plaster hits the top there
06:10 that's right where the moon is and if
06:12 you divide it into centimeters all the
06:14 way down you get around 237 or so and
06:18 the beautiful thing about metric is that
06:20 it's a base 10 system so if a millimeter
06:23 I mean sorry if a centimeter off the
06:25 ground is 1,000 miles then NASA as of
06:31 1968 had got about two millimeters off
06:33 the ground and I believe in Apollo was
06:38 it 8 and 10 they went all the way to the
06:41 ceiling and back safely negating every
06:45 single thing that we know about space
06:47 right now in terms of radiation from the
06:51 Sun radiation from the Van Allen belts
06:54 supposedly all this you know
06:58 hundred million particles / meteorites
07:02 that hit the Earth's atmosphere per
07:03 second or per Manders or something like
07:06 that I mean there's supposed to be a
07:08 bunch of dust out there now some of that
07:12 could be all crap but the principle is
07:15 the same getting all the way up there
07:17 and pulling off maneuvers that it could
07:19 not be simulated on earth ever because
07:23 we don't know exactly what the the
07:24 circumstances are right and I'll give
07:28 you an analogy of aura like likeness in
07:31 terms of scientific method where is
07:35 there another frontier of space that we
07:38 are still exploring a man has done
07:40 amazing things and we've proven it and
07:43 that is the ocean the ocean I think it's
07:48 deepest depths I've always been told
07:50 about seven eight miles down which is
07:52 just terrifying right I mean that's just
07:54 imagine if you traveled 60 miles an hour
07:57 it takes you eight minutes to get to the
07:59 bottom of the ocean if you started at
08:00 the top that's crazy
08:03 that's amazing if you I mean what is uh
08:08 thirty thousand feet you know the
08:11 average distance that the commercial
08:13 airlines fly at six miles in the air
08:15 roughly and if you jumped out of the
08:18 plane in some spacesuit and you didn't
08:21 get torn to shreds by going too quickly
08:23 it's gonna take you a long time to fall
08:25 back to the surface of Earth right so
08:29 the ocean is gigantic if you've got the
08:32 surface of that seven mile point and you
08:34 just remove all the water and you go
08:36 down to terminal velocity it's gonna
08:38 take minutes to hit the ground hit the
08:41 mud at the bottom and so we have
08:44 penetrated the sea at all levels from a
08:47 person snorkeling at the top are playing
08:49 in the with the waves as a surfer but we
08:54 experiment you know we made little
08:55 submarines I mean may bigger submarines
08:57 of them a huge submarines we make these
09:00 little diving vehicles we drop guys down
09:02 inside you know pressure suits with big
09:04 thick metal encasing so they don't get
09:07 crushed to death by the ocean we study
09:09 the vegetation we study the fish life
09:11 it's a very slow process but we
09:14 experiment one a little bit at a time to
09:18 figure out how to do that now this is
09:22 gonna focus on the early part of the
09:23 space program because I want to recap
09:25 everyone's mind so that you have sort of
09:28 the stepping stones of how long man has
09:30 been thinking about rockets in general
09:32 and some of the basic technologies that
09:35 we use to get to the Saturn 5 that we'll
09:37 do a little bit of the conspiracy on the
09:39 top end and talk about all the
09:40 conspiracies in-between but imagine when
09:43 man found out that you know there's this
09:47 I forgot what the color but it's a
09:49 breaking point when you go about 40 feet
09:51 down into the ocean the water above your
09:54 head starts weighing more than you than
09:56 any buoyancy that you can generate and
09:58 you start getting pushed to the bottom
09:59 of the ocean it just gets faster and
10:01 faster and then you get crushed by all
10:02 the water and the pressure you know when
10:05 I first saw Steel get utterly crushed in
10:10 the depth of the ocean it blew my mind
10:14 to this day it's still kind of you know
10:17 without air in the center of a chamber I
10:19 don't understand why an i-beam would get
10:21 crushed or bent because it's definitely
10:24 more dense than water but anyhow we have
10:27 a long history of experimenting and
10:29 making mistakes and hundreds of
10:31 thousands of humans over millions of
10:33 years dying down there and fish and all
10:35 this other stuff teaching us how it
10:37 works and so to suddenly say because
10:43 here's I want you to I want you to take
10:45 the oceans history and its knowledge of
10:48 being circumvented and deep dived and
10:51 flip it the other direction all right so
10:54 we have 200 miles up is all we've done
10:57 as of Apollo 7 okay so that's just a few
11:04 feet down inside the ocean and then we
11:07 have this 237 thousand mile on average
11:10 distance to the moon we got the Van
11:14 Allen belts we never touched never
11:16 experimented with although supposedly
11:19 with geostationary orbit we had and then
11:23 we've got past that we've got the
11:25 normal radiation from the Sun with
11:28 coronal mass ejections we have all the
11:31 debris that's supposedly in space and
11:33 not the stuff that we've launched which
11:34 is today's problem but just natural
11:37 space again imagine someone taking a
11:42 rock about the size of a size of a die
11:44 it's excited died for Vegas right and
11:47 shoving it through your body at about
11:49 35,000 to 100,000 miles per hour and I
11:54 want you to imagine what your body would
11:56 look like after that happened you'd
11:59 probably be turned inside out or you'd
12:01 have definitely a hole all the way
12:02 through your body and you would suddenly
12:04 start just dying so let's briefly go
12:08 through the history of a sort of rocket
12:12 technology because it goes back a really
12:15 long way now some of history obviously
12:18 is to be questioned in terms of its
12:22 accuracy with the earliest use of a
12:27 propellant in a controlled space like a
12:31 little tiny firework was in the 1200 s
12:35 about 12:30 in China they were using it
12:39 as an experimental methodology to create
12:43 fireworks which obviously talks about
12:47 the gunpowder derivatives that made this
12:52 possible and again there's a lot of
12:55 natural rocks that will spark and burn
12:59 you take titanium and shave it down into
13:01 little shavings and then light it on
13:02 fire it's it's quite a little bomb takes
13:06 forever but it takes about 400 years for
13:11 this stuff to be turned into weaponry
13:13 and that is still in China 400 years man
13:19 that's a long time now why it took 400
13:23 years to inter combat is a little
13:26 strange and I'll tell you why that
13:29 doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of
13:31 sense to me I'm not denying any of the
13:32 history of that there blows my mind I
13:35 took so long
13:36 as a child the very first time now again
13:40 up to 1230 you know serendipitously
13:44 figuring out that you could put
13:45 propellant in a cylinder and it creates
13:47 a bottle rocket looking thing totally
13:50 understand that but once you fire a
13:53 bottle rocket and you realize that it if
13:56 anybody's in the way of that thing it
13:59 could take out your eye it could put a
14:01 hole in your body depending on how big
14:03 it is it could rip you to shreds the
14:05 propellant coming out of the back is
14:06 dangerous I'm sure someone burned
14:08 themselves several times to figure out
14:10 oh my god you know that's really hot
14:12 then the idea that you could shoot it
14:15 across a field and make it land on
14:16 somebody's head I figured this out when
14:20 I was a kid playing with fireworks the
14:24 big deal in the Midwest it was that
14:25 bottle rockets were were outlawed
14:28 because they could land on a roof early
14:31 in their cycle and then the flame could
14:33 come still be coming out and you could
14:35 light the house on fire seems to make
14:37 sense and the major rooftop was a shake
14:41 roof where those little wood slats you
14:42 know very flammable and the more they
14:45 just said up there but they are kind of
14:46 tree wood flame retardant never never
14:48 seen a roof catch on fire in my personal
14:51 experiences and I had a cousin that
14:54 would pretty much try to burn down
14:57 anything he'd get his hands on so it
15:00 just baffles me that took four hundred
15:02 years people to realize that hey we
15:04 could poke people's eyes out with his we
15:05 could you know light fires we could
15:07 attach bombs to it maybe that was the
15:09 big thing is to trigger the bomb in a
15:10 last moment thing but they've been
15:12 lighting arrows on fire for a really
15:14 long time to to pillage villages and I'm
15:18 sure that goes back tens of thousands of
15:20 years it's very interesting now I'm
15:23 probably gonna brutalize this guy's name
15:27 but the Russian can Stanton Sol kovarsky
15:35 I apologize this dude was a science
15:41 teacher by 1902 he published a paper
15:44 theorizing how liquid rockets could
15:47 achieve flight
15:49 and in this paper he talked about you
15:52 know you know Rockets taking on this
15:56 fuel the speed that a rocket could
15:58 achieve based on its mass and the
16:00 velocity of which the propellant would
16:02 be used up to create any effect so
16:05 really sort of the basic principles of
16:08 rocket engines in general right you have
16:11 to know okay you know you can't just
16:14 attach a rubber tube to the rocket and
16:17 feed it its fuel you're gonna have to
16:18 put it on board which means you're gonna
16:21 have to figure out a way to balance and
16:23 some sort of cylinder the propellant to
16:26 go through the rocket engine so it was a
16:28 it was a tremendously exciting time for
16:32 this whole new frontier of rocketry to
16:35 balance it out you know and again I'm
16:38 sure that it's a solid-state stuff that
16:40 had been going on up to that point did
16:42 lend itself a little bit of Technology
16:46 but think about it just trying to figure
16:48 out the aperture of which this fuel is
16:52 gonna fall out of an engine you're gonna
16:53 light it on fire it's going to bounce
16:54 against a cone-shaped exit point to
16:59 unify the force right you can't just
17:02 have you know a flamethrower coming out
17:06 the end it that won't create any
17:07 significant pressure and you can't
17:09 control it so they start this process
17:13 right by 1929 the guy had released a
17:16 paper on multistage Rockets theorizing
17:19 both not only to stage Rockets but
17:22 three-stage rockets now now we're
17:24 cooking right it took 400 years to
17:27 figure out that you could poke someone's
17:28 eye out with bottle rocket in China and
17:31 in Russia in less than 20 years this guy
17:34 are a little over I guess let over 25
17:36 years he figured out man
17:38 we're gonna need potentially one form of
17:42 rocket to get it going up the first
17:43 stage and we're going to peel that off I
17:45 mean just think about the complexity of
17:47 a multi-stage rocket we are not talking
17:50 about a time with when you can go down
17:52 to the store and buy it by an Arduino
17:54 circuit we don't have microchips we
17:57 don't have technically and we're getting
18:00 close because the v2 rockets started
18:01 using wire
18:02 and gyroscopes to figure out things but
18:06 it is for me it's just phenomenal that
18:09 they had reached that level of
18:11 sophistication and what's kind of funny
18:12 as if people forget this all the time is
18:14 that Buck Rogers the series on
18:17 television the one in the 1930s had been
18:21 building you know puppeting models to
18:25 show how he was traveling through space
18:28 and of course the 1905
18:29 believe movie the guts the year 1908 or
18:33 something like that the one the real
18:35 famous one that looks like a multi-stage
18:39 rocket takes off from Earth shaped like
18:42 a bullet actually I guess it's not
18:43 multistage but it's a bullet that's in
18:45 sent off and it hits the moon in the eye
18:47 and then they get off on the moon
18:50 phenomenal how quickly this theory
18:53 evolved like everybody was thinking
18:55 about it so then the second dude in the
18:58 United States named Robert Goddard by
19:01 1926 had launched his first rocket that
19:06 was a fuel liquid based rocket and so
19:10 now we're starting to operate on two
19:12 fronts the Russians are operating and
19:14 the Americans are following them and
19:17 again let's think about that Russians
19:19 have the drop when you have the drop
19:22 it's it's a huge thing you know what I
19:24 always have been taught in business is
19:26 whoever is number one in a particular
19:28 sector number two is an order of
19:31 magnitude less than number one in most
19:34 cases for instance in the video game
19:36 industry you have Activision Blizzard is
19:39 number one their market cap I don't know
19:41 what it is today but last time I looked
19:43 it all up it was around 25 billion
19:46 dollar market cap and Electronic Arts
19:49 which I used to work for I guess
19:52 technically I work for Activision first
19:54 but EA who was number one forever had a
19:58 market cap of seven and a half billion
20:00 when Activision Blizzard was at
20:02 twenty-five plus I've been technically
20:04 at 26 so that's the difference it's
20:07 almost four to five X difference so by
20:11 Russia going first you know we'll have
20:14 to see where it's going to go and
20:16 we know that Germany took off in an
20:19 exceptional way now before Brock von
20:22 Braun really got famous there was a
20:26 German by the name of Hermann Oberth who
20:32 was experimenting in Germany with
20:34 rocketry and ended up contributing to
20:37 the v2 rocket now remember the v1 rocket
20:39 is more of a sort of a plane looking
20:43 thing with wings and it wreaked havoc on
20:47 all of its neighbors in the area but the
20:49 v2 mainly England but the v2 was a
20:53 proper rocket and it had wires in it a
20:57 gyroscope in it
21:00 they had rigged a timer in it so they
21:02 couldn't just have like modern-day
21:06 rockets that look down at the ground and
21:07 say Oh or they look up at a satellite
21:09 and say this is where I am GPS now it's
21:11 time to go down and hit something
21:12 specific v2 was just arbitrarily flying
21:16 it so it was the v1 and so what they did
21:20 was they just did math they said look
21:21 this thing travels at approximately X
21:24 miles per hour
21:25 London's that far away let's go ahead
21:27 and just point it in that direction fly
21:30 it and it's got a big conventional
21:31 warhead on the end like TNT or whatever
21:34 and as soon as the nose cone hits
21:36 horrible things occur and again it all
21:40 it has to do is dislodge a building's
21:42 foundation and the building will be the
21:44 weapon not not necessarily the
21:46 conventional warhead so if you can hit a
21:48 building towards the base well here
21:50 comes a big slab of that building down
21:52 and people who are in the building
21:53 you're gonna die people on the ground
21:54 are gonna die it's just a bad situation
21:56 you know no you know in World War two we
22:01 have Wernher von Braun Oberth at a bunch
22:05 of other scientists that will go
22:06 nameless because they did participate
22:08 I'm sure they did amazing things but
22:10 they always put it at one head dude we
22:13 know that after World War two there were
22:16 approximately and I've heard the number
22:17 increased by five hundred recently but
22:20 I've always been told 12-hundred Nazis I
22:23 recently heard upgraded to 1,700 the
22:26 Dulles brothers the Dulles brothers who
22:28 have the Dulles Airport
22:29 to DC they were instrumental in bringing
22:32 over all of these Nazis and smuggling
22:35 them into the United States under
22:36 something called Operation Paperclip
22:38 a fair percentage went off to the
22:41 Intelligence Agency that was the
22:42 skullenbones CIA and the other half went
22:45 over and started working on rocketry but
22:48 there was no formal organization until
22:51 1958 when NASA was formed in the
22:54 catalyst for NASA being form was split
22:58 Nick went up in October 4th 1957 Sputnik
23:03 was just a round ball with some antennas
23:07 off of it and it is beaming down
23:09 messages to the surface of the earth and
23:12 the reason why we believe that that's
23:13 100% real was that it was moving
23:16 extremely fast and everyone with a ham
23:19 radio or some type of receiver could get
23:21 the little blips as it's going across so
23:23 imagine someone trying to tell you their
23:25 satellites don't exist it's all balloons
23:27 and they did do one of the first
23:29 communication Sally was called a Saeta
23:31 loon getting that one minute here
23:33 because we're getting very close to its
23:34 time line but when you have a vehicle
23:38 going across the sky and someone you
23:40 know you're on the phone with your uncle
23:41 and they're going yeah yeah yeah I see
23:43 it I see it and someone in Kansas goes
23:44 okay I'm picking it up now and someone
23:46 California goes I pick it up now and
23:48 it's in the span of you know maybe an
23:53 hour 30 minutes or whatever it's not a
23:55 balloon folks it's something being
23:58 hurled across the continent now again
24:02 whether or not we're not going to get
24:04 into any debates of the shape of the
24:06 world for this particular conversation
24:08 it is a heliocentric ball all right but
24:11 this moment freaked out the United
24:15 States at big way so we had to rush
24:19 because we were in a paradox or paradigm
24:22 debate with the world in that it was
24:25 socialistic communistic Russia was
24:28 saying hey everything's better over here
24:33 we have better technology look because
24:35 with the whole the whole debate of
24:37 communism versus democracy was which
24:41 society is more in
24:43 electorally powerful and by saying
24:46 intellectually powerful scientifically
24:48 educationally what-have-you
24:51 you obviously have a nourishing society
24:55 underneath that layer it's hard to barf
24:58 out a team of scientists if everybody's
25:01 starving to death it's hard to you know
25:02 put together an educational system to
25:04 create this scientists if you have a
25:06 flawed system so to Khrushchev you know
25:10 he's coming over and saying bye-bye
25:12 you know we're gonna walk past you guys
25:15 and so when Sputnik went up it was a big
25:19 deal so by 1958 February 1 we put up the
25:23 Explorer 1 satellite basically did the
25:27 same thing this book Nick did but it did
25:28 it for the United States of America and
25:31 what's interesting is is if you think
25:34 about looking up on Wikipedia or some
25:38 sadly you know or science page on
25:40 YouTube about you know when was the
25:42 first communication satellite put up
25:45 well Sputnik was the first the
25:50 information that broadcast was
25:51 nonsensical
25:52 and just simply there to prove a point
25:54 but it was there and it flew way faster
25:57 than any jet aircraft we had you know
26:00 pioneered or theorized by 1957 so it was
26:04 real so then we start getting into what
26:10 I think is the absolute foundation of
26:12 the Space Agency's you know next the
26:14 next following year you have NASA's
26:16 formation we got to get organized folks
26:19 we're gonna do this NASA's probably one
26:24 founding grace is that they invited the
26:26 world to participate - the Russians
26:28 everybody who was a free democratically
26:32 elected country could participate could
26:35 they have the economics and the science
26:37 to do so I think the entire thing was
26:43 about military capabilities the whole
26:47 thing again you you have Titan rockets
26:51 and Atlas rockets and
26:54 I think we're gonna get into it but they
26:58 turn into ICBM units as much as they
27:02 might have contributed to Skylab or any
27:04 other space station up there that's
27:06 always the sort of cover story of why
27:09 this rocket was created meanwhile it's
27:12 being attached to all kinds of military
27:13 things so again right after the fabled
27:18 hoax of going to the moon six times to
27:22 land and several times three other times
27:25 to just orbit Apollo 11 being the weirdo
27:27 lie about it having a problem
27:30 we got ICBMs really soon I mean true
27:34 intercontinental ballistic missiles and
27:36 they technically occurred before or at
27:40 least occurred on paper before NASA ever
27:43 went to the moon but they wanted these
27:46 things to be miniaturized put inside you
27:49 know submarines to be pushed out as a
27:51 torpedo and then they obviously
27:52 naturally go towards the surface once
27:54 they pop out there's a timer in there
27:56 that goes once you hit air do all these
27:58 special things to blow off your casing
28:00 hit the booster and get going and of
28:04 course they're screaming across the sky
28:05 at a speed that no weapon at the time
28:08 could take out easily but there is a
28:13 gentleman by the name of Arthur Sze
28:14 Clark did in 1945 he had published a
28:22 paper called extraterrestrial relays
28:24 because he was sort of um we turned into
28:28 a science fiction writer but in 45 he
28:31 was talking about potentially putting a
28:34 satellite in space at a certain 22,000
28:38 miles up and rotating at the same speed
28:40 of Earth's rotation such that you could
28:44 have geostationary satellites that could
28:47 just be right over your head and then
28:48 you could beam stuff up bounce things
28:50 off now it's probably important to say
28:53 at this point our relative to the
28:55 conversation to designate the different
28:57 type of satellites that were initially
28:59 put into space there are satellites
29:02 called passive satellites and satellites
29:04 called active satellites what's the
29:06 difference
29:07 hoe passive satellite is nothing more
29:09 than a reflector you hit it with a huge
29:13 cone of transmission's and a fair amount
29:16 will bounce off of it and come back down
29:19 to earth
29:20 now the ionosphere can also perform the
29:23 exact same function this is where a lot
29:26 of folks fall off the satellites exist
29:30 situation and because some of the first
29:33 communication satellites were put up
29:34 with balloons and they still are tested
29:37 with balloons the theory is that they
29:40 don't exist in space I've said it
29:44 several times I've been privy to some
29:48 pretty top-secret satellite technology
29:50 and I have held the schematics of these
29:52 things and they look extremely real ok
29:56 for someone to go to this I guess
29:59 role-playing exercise to say these
30:01 things don't exist
30:02 well Big Brother is going to use this
30:05 stuff and already is using this stuff to
30:07 encapsulate the world into a tyrannical
30:10 place and so if you do not think that
30:12 they exist you are simply giving away an
30:16 ace to your opponent in this game this
30:19 poker game of life so I implore you not
30:23 to do them so arthur c clarke works with
30:27 a couple other guys and he gets to a
30:29 point where geostationary is something
30:33 that we accomplished based on theory now
30:38 there was an interesting experiment
30:41 again and it's called project score was
30:45 in NASA 1958 it was the first proposed
30:49 satellite to relay communications
30:51 because they just realized they you know
30:54 this would be great wouldn't it you
30:55 don't have wires on the ground that have
30:56 to be constantly maintained we can
30:59 literally just beam it through the sky
31:00 and good for us
31:01 that's what we have you know August 12
31:05 1960
31:06 you've got the echo one goes into space
31:08 and it's on a balloon they call it a
31:12 Saeta loon and this was the first time
31:15 we ever really built something
31:17 specifically designed for
31:20 Communications the Pioneer one in 1961
31:25 was the first one that actually gets
31:27 into low orbit and does a relay of
31:30 communications so you can see where this
31:34 technology is building a platform in
31:37 space its first you got to figure out it
31:40 get there so you got to develop all the
31:41 liquid rocket technology and then
31:44 they're starting to immediately use it
31:45 for utilitarian purposes and imagine an
31:51 Air Force Base in I guess the East Coast
31:55 communicating with an Air Force Base and
31:57 the West Coast or whatever base of any
31:59 kind and they don't have to worry about
32:01 a nuclear bomb blowing out the center of
32:04 the earth their center of the United
32:06 States excuse me and I want to bring
32:09 your attention to the invention of the
32:11 internet and the protocol tcp/ip was an
32:16 invention that was debuted and I believe
32:17 69 technically speaking at least so that
32:21 the world could see it which for any of
32:23 you are web engineers and you deal with
32:25 time stamping you know 69 is this
32:27 special time that we have to deal with
32:28 in the technology but the reason why
32:32 tcp/ip was invented was that the
32:35 military said look we're flying drums
32:37 you know Drive disk drive drums our tape
32:41 drums excuse me from one station to
32:42 another one base to another and they're
32:46 being put in communication centers where
32:48 they're played back deciphered messages
32:52 are being written on cards they took the
32:54 card and they they clip it to the edge
32:56 of their cubicle women on rollerskates
32:59 would come by and grab them and then
33:02 deliver them to the post office and it
33:04 was literally the initial protocol of a
33:08 tcp/ip packet from to message go but the
33:12 time stamp on it so a general can send
33:14 another journal a message any and they
33:17 would know that it would get there
33:18 either top-secret delivery which is
33:21 probably more of a human being currying
33:22 a package or non top-secret messages
33:25 back and forth so that was the old way
33:27 then they put wires between bases and
33:29 then they realized oh my god if we
33:31 suffer
33:33 espionage from a foreign country where
33:35 they're blowing up all of our wiring
33:37 stations then then you know no one can
33:40 talk to Kansas City but with tcp/ip you
33:44 had a methodology of wiring everything
33:47 redundantly all across the continent and
33:50 if one wire goes out it doesn't matter
33:52 it's going to wiggle around and find
33:53 another way to get the packet into
33:54 Kansas City it might you know the the
33:56 wire coming in from Oklahoma might be
33:58 dead but the wire coming down from
33:59 Nebraska is okay and it will wiggle
34:01 around until it makes it one of the
34:04 analogies I teach my students to
34:05 understand tcp/ip in a crude manner is I
34:10 at the beginning of the class I find out
34:13 everybody's name and I remember a
34:16 student completely across the usually
34:18 it's a giant conference table or a
34:20 classroom now to bring a post-it packet
34:23 with me and I write a post it to that
34:26 person from me with a hello message and
34:30 then I fold it in half and I write their
34:33 name on the outside and I give it to the
34:34 first student I say look if this isn't
34:36 you if your name on the outside of this
34:40 isn't you then passed it to anyone else
34:42 in the room but you can't pass it to
34:43 anyone who's already had it and
34:45 eventually wiggle-wiggle-wiggle gets
34:47 that person and they get to keep it open
34:49 it up and read inside and that's how the
34:50 packet gets to them so satellite
34:53 technology was awesome it got around
34:55 this entire problem so we get a few more
34:58 geo stationary satellites the Hughes
35:01 Aircraft Company did one called send
35:03 comm 2 which launched in July 26 63 I'm
35:08 giving you some of this history so you
35:09 understand there was a lot of foundation
35:11 before we got to the moon it wasn't like
35:13 it just showed up and there's a Saturn 5
35:15 rocket and that's why it's a hoax not at
35:17 all not at all but part of the sitcom
35:21 geostationary satellite you have this
35:23 guy Yuri Gagarin in 1961 is the first
35:28 one to leave Earth's surface and a
35:32 rocket in 1961 that's a big deal right
35:36 they had tried it out on dogs and
35:39 monkeys first and ironically all those
35:43 animals usually perished on the way up I
35:46 think the monkeys came
35:47 okay some of them didn't some of them
35:51 did my guy named Alan Shepard is the
35:54 first one that went up for the United
35:55 States and the redstone rocket by 1963
36:01 John Glenn goes up and he's our first
36:04 American dude in space and then it
36:08 started turning into like rocket
36:09 families with certain objectives you
36:12 know certain payloads payload
36:14 requirements and it starts off pushing
36:19 through a family of rockets called the
36:22 Delta the Atlas Mercury Gemini and the
36:25 Titans this is all prior to Saturn 5 the
36:29 Titan is supposed to be the big boy and
36:32 the Titan is what is now versioned up to
36:34 get things out - supposedly Mars we're
36:37 gonna talk about that a little bit Atlas
36:41 is in its fifth version there's been the
36:45 Delta still flies there's 325 successful
36:49 missions on the Delta but think about it
36:53 while this is going on
36:54 JFK eventually comes out and says look
36:56 we're going to the moon safely within
36:58 the next ten years to put a man on the
37:00 surface and bring him back right so that
37:05 galvanizes the United States to be in a
37:07 space program and that is always what
37:09 needs to happen in a kind of wag the dog
37:10 scenario you have to get the public
37:14 behind spending billions and billions of
37:16 taxpayer dollars to do something
37:18 extraordinary
37:20 but what if JFK had come out and said we
37:24 are in a rocket war with Russia and we
37:32 know that their goal is to put a nuclear
37:34 bomb on the end of one of these rockets
37:36 and deliver to the United States and if
37:39 we don't get with it they're gonna be
37:41 able they're going to be this
37:42 predominant country in the world and if
37:46 communists Russian objectives continue
37:48 it's like the Borg they just want to
37:50 take over everyone and convert them to
37:52 socialism
37:53 aka total control and you know for those
37:57 of you who are historians with you know
38:00 from Strauss to
38:01 Marxism and all that kind of stuff you
38:04 know that socialism has always been the
38:06 wet dream of those that control the
38:08 world whether they call it communism on
38:10 top or pure socialism they don't give a
38:12 crap they don't care and that's the war
38:14 we're in now is that they're coming back
38:15 to make a final play before everybody
38:17 wakes up due to the internet and so
38:20 what's going on in the 60s is that JFK
38:23 is saying look and you know who knows
38:25 what he knew was true and false I don't
38:29 think anyone in 61 or by 60 when I
38:33 should say wanted to fiddle with the
38:36 moon mission and not make it happen I
38:37 think they really wanted to do it and I
38:39 think we still should do it now some of
38:43 the estimated numbers of spending that
38:47 went on in the NASA organization from
38:49 1964 to 73 the technical amount of money
38:53 they spent was 6 point 1 billion dollars
38:55 in today's money it's about 42 billion
38:58 dollars by the year 2018 they managed to
39:03 rustle up 400,000 employees roughly to
39:07 make the moon mission even attempt to
39:11 bowl the Saturn 5 rocket well it's on
39:16 paper cost was a hundred and eighty five
39:18 million dollars a unit in today's money
39:21 that's about 1.6 billion so that's
39:24 expensive but if you think about it a
39:26 b-2 bombers I believe one to two billion
39:28 dollars so it's about average cost for
39:33 something massive to occur the three
39:36 companies that are solicited to really
39:38 handle the bulk of assembly and design
39:40 as Boeing North American and Douglas
39:46 some of these companies have obviously
39:48 merged the Saturn 5 could lift a payload
39:53 of 310 thousand pounds now obviously a
39:57 tremendous amount of that is the fuel
39:59 for those of you like technical
40:03 statistical buffs I thought this was
40:05 rather interesting it was 138 feet tall
40:09 33 feet across and it empty weighed 287
40:15 and pounds pretty well they said his
40:19 gross mass was around five million
40:21 pounds Wow unbelievable right that thing
40:24 went into the error that is not a
40:26 debatable fact it did go up into the air
40:29 it did disappear and to probably
40:32 low-orbit a company name Rocketdyne was
40:38 hired to develop the boosters to go in
40:40 the bottom of this thing now you have an
40:42 interesting thing because you have
40:45 Russia getting caught in a forgery
40:47 saying a guy went up didn't go up you
40:50 have Russia losing cosmonauts in
40:52 horrible burn fires you know because the
40:54 Rockets crashed and so you know things
40:59 aren't going completely smoothly
41:00 obviously we had gus grissom die on the
41:04 tarmac i believe in apollo 1 1965
41:07 probably conclusively murdered by
41:09 cyanide prior to the fire that burned up
41:13 because the official report on him dying
41:15 is several inches thick I think nearly
41:18 18 inches thick bart sibrel has had the
41:21 privilege of not only reading that
41:22 report but conversing and having a
41:24 fairly decent friendship with Gus's wife
41:26 and son who's now a commercial pilot and
41:29 the official report says that all three
41:31 gentlemen died of cyanide poisoning and
41:33 then there was a fire they were strapped
41:37 into their seats none of them moved as a
41:39 result of being on fire when they have
41:41 blast doors because the rocket wasn't
41:44 going there just sitting there running
41:46 through a test I believe the day before
41:48 the launch was supposed to occur but Gus
41:51 Grissom came out and said look this
41:53 thing is never going to the moon it's a
41:55 lemon we have rocket technology but it's
41:58 low orbit stuff and he was quoted as
42:02 calling it a lemon at a press conference
42:03 within the week of his death but
42:06 Rocketdyne starts off with the j2
42:08 rockets and eventually ends up with the
42:10 f1 boosters which have gone through
42:12 several iterations what's sort of
42:14 interesting about this is that in modern
42:17 day times Bezos Jeffery Bezos together
42:20 created Amazon who's now disgustingly
42:22 rich as I actually put together a
42:26 mission to go out and
42:29 you know find the f1 boosters on the
42:30 bottom of the ocean and I think it's
42:33 interesting he says he found them and of
42:36 course we've seen the photographs of it
42:38 and they're all in different states of
42:39 disarray and corrosion and what-have-you
42:41 but immediately NASA said okay if you
42:44 bring those things to the surface
42:45 they're immediately our property you
42:47 can't keep them it's a very interesting
42:51 thing to hold a space agency hostage
42:55 with our own [ __ ] and I think there
42:57 might be a bit of a play with Bezos
42:59 doing that now their f1 boosters
43:02 scattered all over the United States of
43:04 America they're in parking lots they're
43:07 in museums they're in all different
43:09 locations at all different states of
43:11 being inversions and what-have-you
43:13 according to NASA of course all these
43:15 are disabled all of these are missing
43:17 key components what have you so you're
43:19 not able to walk up to it and steal its
43:20 designs let's just say but who would
43:24 steal the designs would only be a
43:26 country that couldn't go to space most
43:27 likely the Russians are creating this
43:31 Ardi series of boosters and one thing I
43:37 have to give credit to Russia for and
43:39 you'll hear me say this several times is
43:40 that the Russians got to the point where
43:42 they had built a massive rocket and I
43:44 mean it it was it was designed around
43:48 putting as many boosters in the bottom
43:50 as humanly possible I should say and
43:54 that their base went down and expanded
43:56 to fit more engines at the bottom and
43:59 NASA's whole kind of dismissive claim
44:01 towards why the Russians didn't go to
44:03 the moon was that oh well we put more f1
44:06 boosters at the bottom and our f1
44:07 boosters were more powerful blah blah
44:09 blah untrue untrue untrue so there's a
44:15 Netflix special out there called cosmic
44:17 drone that you should watch because it
44:21 shows you the BS around NASA saying that
44:25 Russia didn't have the booster strength
44:27 to get to the moon and that was and of
44:30 course they say oh you know they had a
44:32 big explosion that happened it was like
44:34 an explosion on the tarmac or a launch
44:37 pad of a rocket was hardly a deterrent
44:42 or doing anything we had massive numbers
44:45 of Launchpad explosions that were
44:49 unmanned or just they just immediately
44:51 explode we kept going they had the same
44:55 thing they kept going so for them to
44:57 bail out was very interesting and they
44:59 bailed out for scientific reasons but
45:04 1995 in this documentary if you just
45:06 watch it it's all in Russian you're
45:07 gonna have to watch some some you know
45:09 transcribed subtitles NASA was told that
45:17 these boosters which were supposed to be
45:19 destroyed because the in 1973 after we
45:22 had finished in 72 supposedly going to
45:24 the moon a million times safely Russia
45:27 cancels their program I believe they did
45:30 have an explosion towards the end but
45:32 come on plus Russia is going out of
45:34 business they're running out of money
45:36 and that was one of the true objectives
45:38 of the space program is to break their
45:40 bank by getting into a competition that
45:42 we would visibly win using probably
45:45 Hollywood but in this documentary you're
45:47 gonna see them pull open the doors to
45:49 this Siberian stash of these boosters
45:53 and they are all wrapped up beautifully
45:56 and again they were told it had
45:57 scientists was told destroy these he
46:00 didn't he had him shipped to Siberia put
46:03 in a warehouse when they resurrected one
46:06 of these boosters I believe here in
46:08 California I could be wrong but I think
46:10 it was California where they tested it
46:12 and there's a video that being tested on
46:13 this documentary they said that the
46:16 average booster power against the F once
46:19 was 2.1 times faster than the best or
46:22 more powerful I should say than the best
46:24 booster NASA developed by 1995 now I'm
46:30 no historian on rocket boosters or
46:33 anything like that but I would imagine
46:35 that the F one booster the Rocketdyne
46:37 created in 1969 has been verged in
46:40 several times in the 25 years that
46:42 preceded our followed excuse me it's use
46:46 in the saturn v rocket and even with all
46:49 the improvements that nasa and all of
46:51 its partners were able to manifest into
46:53 these engines they were still
46:56 less than 50% towards where Russia was
46:59 in 73
47:00 but of course were told this lie that
47:02 Russia didn't have the booster strength
47:03 to get there or the rocket designed to
47:05 put enough in the bottom lies lies lies
47:08 lies
47:10 so Russia star sorry America / NASA
47:13 starts licensing this technology from
47:15 Russia
47:16 now the huge difference between the two
47:18 rockets was that Russia had mastered the
47:22 technique of creating what is
47:23 effectively for those of you know cars a
47:25 turbo inside their rocket designs so all
47:29 of the fuel that was unspent falling
47:31 through all the chambers for combustion
47:33 was then recaptured and put back through
47:35 the rocket so it used more of the fuel
47:38 than anything NASA had put together but
47:41 also the design I guess is probably
47:44 because of the sustained burning I don't
47:46 know quite what the what the thruster
47:49 you know pivotal point is but it was it
47:53 was better so with all that background
47:56 and again we have faced spacewalks from
47:59 Gemini where the it's all stop-motion
48:02 animation where these the astronaut
48:04 jumping out of the vehicle in low orbit
48:07 and there's like a glove that goes off
48:09 into space and his tubes banging around
48:11 and he's like he's all animate he saw
48:13 you know just like honk King Kong back
48:16 in the day in the 1930s he turns his
48:20 head and looks at the camera and waves
48:22 turning your head is impossible in these
48:25 suits because that's how you take off
48:27 the helmet it wasn't something that was
48:29 a feature but the animator took artistic
48:31 license and made something happen that
48:33 couldn't happen spacewalks faked I think
48:38 that most of the orbital video that you
48:40 see from Russia looks horribly fake
48:42 because earth down below looks nothing
48:44 like the earth what we see today but
48:47 let's think about it the Saturn 5 rocket
48:52 was lit up beautifully because NASA
48:54 hired you know Hollywood professionals
48:57 to make this thing look amazing at night
48:58 and it launches and it is and this is
49:04 what's important for those of you who
49:06 don't believe that this was a hoax you
49:09 know I'm a hoax
49:10 person I believe it wasn't true I was
49:12 debriefed by two guys from NASA at a
49:14 lunch totally unintentional just
49:18 happened then what they told me in 1981
49:20 I held for ten years not believing a
49:22 word that they said but remembering
49:24 everything that they said because it was
49:25 the most bizarre conversation to ever
49:26 have my life I was raised the NASA kid
49:29 loved everything I mean I had the Space
49:32 Shuttle poster and I used to draw the
49:33 Saturn five and I used to work with the
49:35 old rockets you know the ABCD engine
49:37 Rockets used to build in cardboard I was
49:40 very good at that by the way and so I
49:43 was all up as a huge believer then bart
49:46 sibrel ten years later releases the
49:48 movie a funny thing happened on the way
49:49 to the moon which you need to see if you
49:51 can if you can handle parting with
49:54 thirty bucks
49:55 definitely go to sobral calm as i'm
49:57 gonna put it in the in the description
50:00 of this video but if i go over and get a
50:02 copy he'll sign it for you and send it
50:03 to you he uses that as a fair amount of
50:06 his income and i think he deserves our
50:08 funds to do that i have an interview
50:11 with him in season three if you haven't
50:13 seen it just go to the website deep
50:14 thoughts video comm and search on
50:17 interview and you'll find the video in
50:20 the search field but he reader
50:22 reiterates everything that my friend
50:24 said from NASA and he got most of his
50:27 original information from casing but
50:30 Bart Sorrell was given a video that is a
50:33 top secret video that wasn't supposed to
50:34 be released to the public which proves
50:37 that they were using a gel against a
50:39 window with which but he now thinks is a
50:43 false picture of the earth that had been
50:47 kind of digitally put together or not
50:49 digitally but put together inside of a
50:51 you know razor bleeding negatives and
50:53 putting together high-altitude composite
50:55 shots to create this earth but it's
50:57 proof you watch the video and you're
50:58 like oh my god yeah there's a CIA track
51:01 that comes in while they're talking
51:03 between the astronauts in Houston and
51:05 and this voice goes talk because they
51:09 were trying to keep all the
51:09 communications delayed by four seconds
51:11 to keep up the illusion they were
51:12 traveling away from Earth but the Saturn
51:16 five launches its it's the trailer of
51:19 MTV back in 1982
51:21 it's amazing it's an
51:23 amazing accomplishment of man Bar None
51:26 putting a group of astronauts in
51:29 200-mile up low orbit to sit there for
51:32 the entire trip and then when it's time
51:34 for them to come down they come down but
51:37 you have a bit of an issue and we're
51:39 gonna create another couple episodes
51:41 that are going to go into this in
51:42 further detail but one of the listeners
51:44 sent me a great video of the animations
51:48 that were put together for this recent
51:50 Indian in the country of India satellite
51:55 that was supposed to go to the South
51:57 Pole I believe of one of the poles of
52:00 the moon and of course they're allowed
52:02 to say that they go because they have to
52:04 stay away from all of the missions that
52:06 we did because if anybody landed a rover
52:09 which is one reason why they never have
52:10 put a rover on the moon it could drive
52:13 over to all these supposed landing sites
52:16 and prove that nothing's there which is
52:18 why that your platform it's on Mars
52:21 supposedly lie has never been tested on
52:24 the closest body in space which is what
52:26 any logical space organization would do
52:30 as I've said several times on the show
52:32 if you and I invented a car they ran on
52:36 orange juice or whatever well we just
52:38 have a weird engine that runs on gas but
52:40 doesn't use much gas whatever we're
52:42 doing first thing we would do is drive
52:44 it down the street turn around the stop
52:45 sign and come back to the laboratory the
52:47 next thing we might do is go to the
52:49 drugstore next thing we might do is go
52:50 to the city next door may the state next
52:52 door then across the United States we'd
52:53 prove that the car worked before selling
52:56 it to the public right not so much with
52:59 the Mars situation they'd go immediately
53:01 to Mars and immediately succeed it's a
53:03 joke but the elliptical orbit that's
53:07 supposed to be achieved by this rocket
53:11 is the most nonsensical thing you've
53:14 ever seen in your life and if what's
53:17 funny is if you use the animations which
53:19 I can't show you because they'll hit me
53:22 with copyright strikes which I've
53:23 already done with previous videos and
53:25 had to re-edit them and repost them I
53:27 probably lost 10,000 views just from
53:29 copyright strikes where I had to read at
53:31 the video what they're telling you is is
53:34 that they're putting a satellite
53:37 which is the lunar module lunar capsule
53:41 all that stuff in orbit around Earth and
53:44 supposedly this thing then suddenly with
53:47 a fixed amount of speed right so the
53:50 Saturn five blows all of its stages off
53:52 and this thing is now in orbit around
53:54 Earth if you look at the old animations
53:57 in the 60s they blew it they just
54:00 created this perfectly circular orbit
54:02 and then said magically it breaks away
54:03 and goes to the moon in fact I never
54:06 heard of I'm sure it's on paper back in
54:09 the day but as a child I was never
54:11 taught the slingshot theory until
54:12 science fiction movies started using the
54:14 slingshot theory and then all of a
54:17 sudden it was a part of NASA's daily
54:20 claim of how they made it to the moon
54:24 now we know from normal satellites that
54:27 if you put anything into space and
54:29 remember an orbit is nothing more than
54:30 an object that has been thrown so far
54:33 and so fast away from the earth that by
54:36 the time it starts trying to fall back
54:37 to earth there's no earth there so it
54:39 just Falls around the outer shape of the
54:43 earth yeah it makes sense on paper you
54:47 know I have a different theory of
54:48 gravity it's ether based and not
54:51 phenomenon based go see my episodes on
54:53 gravity to figure that out deep thoughts
54:55 radio Calm typing gravity it's a couple
54:57 episodes on it you'll see all my
54:58 episodes on ether you'll have a
55:01 beautiful rebirth of all science in that
55:03 realm but immediately when the rockets
55:06 stop pushing this thing it's going to
55:09 immediately start losing its orbital
55:12 distance from the earth because as it
55:14 continues falling it does lose just a
55:16 little bit of its orbital diameter from
55:18 Earth and eventually crashes into the
55:20 surface of the earth usually it burns up
55:23 hitting the atmosphere and you see that
55:26 you've seen that several times on on the
55:28 news right but what they want you to
55:31 believe is that they've thrown this
55:36 thing in a way now again there's two
55:40 sides of this equation for slingshot
55:42 Theory there's the leaving a body
55:45 slingshot theory which that's the one
55:48 part that never will make sense on paper
55:49 without a
55:50 front type of rocket and then there's
55:53 the catch the catch could make sense as
55:57 long as the body that you were going
55:59 towards is not moving faster through
56:00 space than your rocket that's
56:02 approaching it but the idea is that you
56:04 come at the moon at a kind of a sideways
56:07 angle that wouldn't normally hit the
56:08 moon but the moon's gravity grabs the
56:10 vehicle and starts pushing it in to this
56:12 elliptical orbit first one is really you
56:15 know gets close on one and goes really
56:16 far away and then magically it never
56:18 loses its bottom arc so it never hits
56:22 the moon but then the outer arc is
56:23 starting to collapse and then you can do
56:25 all kinds of wild things with supposedly
56:27 getting in stationary orbit or landing
56:29 or what-have-you
56:30 you see this for the reconnaissance
56:32 satellites around Mars and Jupiter and
56:35 Saturn and blah blah blah
56:37 okay but the problem is your very first
56:41 exiting strategy makes absolutely no
56:43 sense on paper whatsoever because what
56:47 does the exiting strategy look like the
56:50 exiting strategy means that you are in
56:52 this perfectly circular orbit around
56:54 Earth and supposedly somehow magically
56:59 you have a sudden introduction of force
57:05 that starts to make that orbit that's
57:08 perfectly circular around the earth turn
57:10 into an oval and then supposedly you
57:15 have this other extra amount of energy
57:17 that's introduced to pop out of this
57:21 large elliptical orbit that's initially
57:24 around Earth the amount of power that
57:28 would be required and von braun
57:30 mentioned this in his design which he
57:32 shared with walt disney after he
57:35 launched disneyland and he had
57:37 Tomorrowland he started putting stuff on
57:39 TV to really inspire kids to get into
57:41 this which is all commendable and
57:43 amazing again von braun is a bad guy
57:46 because he pioneered the v1 v2 rockets
57:50 whether or not he truly redeemed himself
57:52 in the eyes of God by inspiring kids to
57:55 get into science for the remainder of
57:56 the majority of his life at least half
57:58 of his life not two-thirds of his life
58:00 that's debatable
58:01 I really can't
58:03 weigh in on that myself personally but
58:08 the reason why his design was completely
58:10 different is because this elliptical
58:12 orbit thing is impossible without
58:14 designing it would be essentially a
58:17 Saturn 5 rocket that pushes another
58:19 Saturn 5 rocket into space and once you
58:23 get into that stationary orbit you're
58:26 gonna have to take the second rocket and
58:28 push really really hard to get this
58:30 elliptical thing to start to occur once
58:33 you reach the sweet spot you're gonna
58:35 have to have a third engine push it out
58:38 of that elliptical orbit towards
58:40 whatever body in space you're trying to
58:41 go for no such rocket has ever been
58:44 invented ever there's an animation and a
58:49 video you can watch that I can't put on
58:51 this video because I'll get striked but
58:53 when von Braun worked with Walt Disney
58:55 they created what looks like to me the
58:58 absolute foundational science that was
59:02 in the movie 2001 a Space Odyssey you
59:05 have to build a space station in space
59:07 which von Braun theorized as a wheel in
59:10 space exactly like you saw in 2001 a
59:12 Space Odyssey although it looks a little
59:14 corny in the 1950s then you have to
59:18 ferry as von Braun said lifts a bunch of
59:23 fuel into space and stored at that Space
59:25 Station then you build a different type
59:29 of ship that is not nothing like the
59:31 saturn v with its capsule and that kind
59:33 of stuff and you launch from that space
59:35 station directly towards the moon
59:38 because you have all this fuel you can
59:40 just point it and go are you gonna have
59:43 to still combat the gravity of Earth
59:46 absolutely but you could achieve
59:49 theoretically a mission to the moon with
59:53 his technology now von Braun is also
59:57 very famous for stating and I believe in
59:59 1955 or 56 paper and then reaffirming it
60:03 later in the 60s that the Saturn 5
60:05 rocket well I should say this not the
60:08 Saturn 5 but whatever rocket was going
60:10 to take us to the moon would have to be
60:11 around the size of the Empire State
60:12 Building to get us there
60:16 and of course they shot that guy up
60:18 second that we're done with the moon
60:20 missions he retires from NASA 1974 he
60:24 passed away in 1977 it should be noted
60:28 that the president of NASA also resigned
60:30 within a month of landing on the moon
60:32 why would he do that okay you were
60:35 sitting on top of one of the most if
60:37 it's legit one of the most amazing
60:39 accomplishments of men besides learning
60:41 how to make fire and the wheel and now
60:44 you're quitting and you're quitting in
60:47 my opinion because you don't want to be
60:49 caught in this scam you wanted to go on
60:50 with other people being in charge so by
60:52 the time anyone's ever cut your
60:55 insignificant you're just the president
60:57 who had to inherit a lie and if you got
61:00 pressed by the public you could say look
61:02 I knew it was a lie could say anything
61:03 they were threatening my life but you
61:05 could see on paper I got out the month
61:07 after I wasn't going to have anything to
61:10 do with this and of course he never had
61:11 to pay that price because the hoax still
61:13 exists to this day so von Braun had it
61:17 right I mean at least that's a
61:19 legitimate platform to consider but
61:23 there's another phenomenon about all
61:25 space programs I want you guys to
61:26 remember and it's something that you
61:28 need to almost need Yorick say to anyone
61:30 who's trying to guilt trip you for being
61:32 lucid the game of space travel and of
61:37 space programs other than ones that are
61:39 probably low orbit satellites maybe
61:41 geocentric geostationary satellites etc
61:43 is it the second well it's called out of
61:47 sight out of mind what does that mean
61:50 okay well Saturn five rocket goes up in
61:53 1969 in July 19th I believe I'm not sure
61:57 if that's the day we touched touch the
61:59 moon I think it's the launch day but it
62:03 gets out of sight out of mind
62:05 it launches it launches out of your
62:07 sight and it's as unbelievable I mean
62:09 imagine watching i watch the space
62:11 shuttle go off when I was probably about
62:12 13 years old and it was phenomenal
62:14 watching that thing take off I mean the
62:16 engine sounds are unlike anything you've
62:19 ever heard and I believe those are
62:20 solid-state engines right no liquid
62:23 except the central tank right but once
62:27 it's out of your sight
62:28 then they can claim anything that they
62:30 want and one of the real juvenile things
62:33 that's happening right now
62:35 and it's an innocent mistake that we're
62:36 making is that when we see all those
62:39 NASA guys sitting around their computers
62:41 supposedly monitoring this mission
62:43 they're looking at computers computer
62:45 screens okay they weren't watching a
62:49 video game man they weren't watching
62:51 animated sprites going across the screen
62:54 telling them where we were they were
62:56 simply looking at numbers on screens
62:58 telling them where this thing was so a
63:02 lot of people say well this was
63:03 confirmed by Russia and that's really
63:07 the only partner that was qualified to
63:08 confirm any I've heard you know China's
63:11 throne and it was like China and the 60s
63:13 was in this technical stone Age's you
63:15 know they weren't they weren't looking
63:16 up going oh yeah it's totally real but
63:20 the way that they faked the moon mission
63:23 I have a whole episode on how we faked
63:25 it so if you're all bent out of shape
63:26 you'll see the you know how we how they
63:28 faked it it's gonna be in the NASA
63:30 category on the website deep thoughts
63:32 where do calm is that in April of that
63:36 year March or something like that they
63:37 put up a satellite in space around Earth
63:40 that beamed down to NASA Houston all of
63:43 the data that would be coming down to
63:46 the earth if we had gone to the moon so
63:48 they could simulate the whole thing
63:51 technically so that when we really do it
63:54 will have everyone rehearsed and that's
63:56 why the three major satellite stations
63:58 around Earth they also heard this fake
64:00 satellite going around beaming down the
64:02 information and they interviewed there's
64:05 a documentary out there I cannot find
64:06 anymore for various reasons that
64:12 interviewed the gentleman that worked in
64:14 the satellite station in Australia and
64:16 it was a party they were having to
64:19 commemorate their contribution to going
64:22 to the moon in this documentary
64:24 filmmaker and I can't remember if I was
64:25 hearing Australian voices or British
64:28 voices I tend to think it was a British
64:30 team that came over to interview these
64:32 folks but I could be wrong but on video
64:34 on HD sixteen by nine video
64:38 the guy proposed he has them tell them
64:40 the story and their moment most these
64:43 guys are really old by now it's like 60
64:45 70 80 year old guys and there was one
64:48 young guy what younger guy is probably
64:50 60s that was there I think
64:51 either that or he was much healthier
64:53 than the other guys but he asked them he
64:55 said look you say that we went to the
64:59 moon because you heard all of the
65:02 communications just like Sputnik of the
65:05 lunar module going to the moon and
65:09 that's what makes you think that we went
65:11 and if you had a lie detector test today
65:12 you'd say we went and you wouldn't be a
65:14 liar on this tape but you really are not
65:16 one to have proof you don't you weren't
65:19 on the vehicle
65:20 I don't know that Michael Collins Buzz
65:23 Aldrin Neil Armstrong ever had a
65:25 lie-detector test wouldn't that be
65:27 interesting because Michael is pretty
65:28 young still it would be interesting you
65:31 know but they would probably rigged the
65:32 whole thing but anyway they said the guy
65:35 the guys hey look what if they just put
65:38 another satellite up in July
65:40 unbeknownst to use launching from
65:42 somewhere calling it some communication
65:46 satellite for some telecom but it really
65:48 is just this other satellite and it just
65:50 changed the numbers or the one that's
65:52 already up there goes to script number
65:55 two and the microchips or the rope
65:57 memory that they said they had and it
66:00 beams down different numbers to you guys
66:01 slightly different couldn't that have
66:04 forged your readings and given you the
66:08 impression that we went and every single
66:11 guy who spoke after they ask that
66:13 question went oh yeah yeah that's
66:16 totally possible huh what do you think
66:19 about that you know and this one guy
66:21 walks up through a sliding glass door
66:23 and says I don't think we should be
66:25 talking about this oh there's the
66:29 thought police
66:30 there's the deep state police there's
66:32 the cover up police if they would to the
66:35 moon there that guy would have never
66:37 uttered those words another little
66:40 smoking gun for your quiver of truth so
66:44 that's how they faked all the data down
66:46 to NASA but to make it even easier for
66:49 NASA folks to fake it and
66:52 people always ask me well you know
66:54 thousands of people participated in this
66:56 and I can't believe that they would all
66:59 be still in on the hoax 50 years later I
67:01 don't disagree I don't think that many
67:05 people participated in the hoax I think
67:07 most people were sitting at a terminal
67:08 staring at numbers which could be
67:11 transmitted locally doesn't have to come
67:14 from outer space they're just telling a
67:16 program to tell these folks what's going
67:18 on hmm
67:20 food for thought right the number one
67:25 Achilles heel for the space program is
67:28 the slingshot theory escaping earth it
67:31 doesn't work it doesn't work and we've
67:34 just been looking past it the entire
67:35 time
67:36 the second thing is just the sheer
67:39 statistics of the whole thing as again
67:43 borrowing this from bart sibrel
67:44 so give this dude some props give him
67:46 some money however you can because he's
67:48 worth it he has made the point but in 50
67:52 years we haven't recreated this amazing
67:55 accomplishment of man we haven't gone
67:57 back to the moon with superior
67:59 technology we can put a rover on Mars
68:01 every single time on his 1998 which was
68:04 a huge lie but he also has a great
68:08 analogy in the interview I gave him
68:09 where he talks about the 747 747 took
68:13 over a hundred and sixty attempts to get
68:14 it off the ground we already had planes
68:17 we already had aviation all figured out
68:19 we had the shape of the wing figured out
68:20 we had plenty of jets that were flying
68:22 the 747 took 160 attempts to get it off
68:26 the ground it's like 165 or something
68:29 like that and it took I believe
68:32 something around 17 years to get the
68:34 whole thing created it's just a
68:36 commercial airline so you might say ah
68:40 but the NASA had a lot more people
68:42 working on this other thing well you
68:43 can't go any faster than the
68:44 experimentation on the launch pad
68:47 the other big statistical anomaly which
68:51 makes absolutely no sense is my analogy
68:53 gave it at the beginning of this episode
68:54 we had only been two millimeters off off
68:56 the surface of the ground in terms of
68:58 relative distance to the moon and all of
69:02 a sudden we go all the way to the
69:05 ceiling
69:05 and back over and over and over again
69:09 even the Apollo 11 excuse me the Apollo
69:12 13 I probably said that wrong in early
69:14 episode it has this anomaly on the
69:17 outside an explosion which even in the
69:21 official report they never could figure
69:23 out what exploded on the outside as less
69:25 than a paragraph a description on it but
69:27 a Apollo 14 no problem we're not going
69:30 to delay things much we're gonna get it
69:32 back out there again well why did Apollo
69:34 13 have this weird anomaly because
69:37 Society was getting completely bored to
69:39 death of the moon missions and starting
69:41 to write in and complain to networks
69:42 that their favorite television shows
69:44 were being pulled off the air because of
69:45 this moon coverage one of the Bing I
69:48 Love Lucy wow that's a cool contribution
69:52 that Lucy made and she didn't even know
69:53 about it
69:55 so they had to create drama now I want
69:58 to loop back since we're sort of done
70:00 with the basics there the next episodes
70:02 going to be about getting to the moon's
70:05 surface and then we're gonna do a whole
70:07 episode about being on the moon's
70:09 surface and then getting home stuff I've
70:12 covered in the past but I'm trying to
70:14 cover in a lot more details so that we
70:16 cover all the bases exhaustively right
70:19 but I did an episode a few back where I
70:22 talked about Stanley Kubrick
70:23 participating in this whole thing and
70:25 I've had some individuals still have a
70:28 problem with the fact that the shining
70:31 looks conclusively calling out to some
70:36 secret you know participation and the
70:38 moon missions and I shared how I work
70:43 with Vivian Kubrick for hours and hours
70:46 I mean I don't even know we would have
70:48 four or five-hour conversations for days
70:51 and days and days parsing every detail
70:54 and but she was very good about you know
70:58 entertaining the idea that maybe your
71:00 father was involved with this stuff and
71:01 then we started looking at where he was
71:04 physically in the world and the claims
71:07 of where he's been in the world to
71:09 participate in this meeting with Nixon
71:11 and all this other stuff and it simply
71:13 defies his travel plans and his
71:15 locations
71:17 now again I'm just gonna recap a little
71:21 bit for those of you seen that episode
71:22 this will be a repeat for sure but I
71:25 think it's important because I'm gonna
71:27 add a little more my own exhaustive
71:30 research in this especially with Viviane
71:32 personally to drive home the fact that
71:35 that The Shining was a connection of
71:39 coincidences and people hate when I when
71:41 they devoted themselves to that theory
71:43 and there's videos of me telling you
71:45 that this is true and I'm gonna leave
71:48 him up there but I was wrong I was so
71:50 completely wrong so it is my personal
71:54 belief and I this particular thing I'm
71:58 talking about is something that I don't
72:00 think Vivienne quite has an opinion
72:01 about I think that 2001 a Space Odyssey
72:05 was an experiment in what technology
72:11 would be very handy when trying to forge
72:14 space footage
72:16 especially moon footage I don't think I
72:20 don't think anything for 2001
72:22 participated in the saturn v launch any
72:25 of the crazy optics that were done
72:28 inside the capsule the bart sibrel
72:30 revealed in the top-secret video he was
72:31 given has nothing to do with that but
72:35 front projection you know Hollywood has
72:40 been doing overcranking cameras for
72:42 years to make things look like they have
72:43 weightlessness slow motion but he
72:47 physically you know the only thing that
72:48 people can lean on at this point is to
72:50 say oh it was all filmed in England and
72:52 that's where Kubrick physically was
72:56 Kubrick was home with his family the day
72:58 that they landed on the moon at least
73:01 put that out on TV right and he was very
73:04 excited about the whole thing he wasn't
73:05 oh great my footage is going out there
73:08 to the whole world sort of thing the
73:11 Vivian made one point that I think I
73:14 might have forgotten to make in the
73:15 recap of the whole thing in the episode
73:17 did last season and it's if you respect
73:22 Kubrick and if you don't and all I can
73:25 say is you know nothing about filmmaking
73:27 or a doubt there's too many people out
73:29 there that don't
73:30 she said look man have you seen the moon
73:33 footage
73:34 my father would roll in his grave if if
73:39 he thought that that's the footage he
73:40 left the public to figure out that we
73:42 went to the moon it's horrible
73:44 implementations of the technology now
73:46 was it good enough to fool a public
73:48 absolutely so to that they get an A+
73:51 but it ain't Kubrick level filming if
73:55 you watch 2001 a Space Odyssey there's a
73:58 special scene when the doctor goes from
74:00 Earth through the wheel talks to the
74:03 scientists from Russia then goes to the
74:06 moon has the debriefing about having
74:08 found the monolith on the moon and then
74:10 they go out to see it they're eating ham
74:12 sandwiches and stuff right makuu Britt
74:15 got gravity right in 2001 a Space
74:17 Odyssey
74:17 they weren't floating around on the moon
74:20 a 280-pound astronaut meeting his
74:23 180-pound base body with a hundred pound
74:25 backpack on the back and that's negating
74:27 a lot of the weight that was supposedly
74:28 on these guys they'd weigh about 40
74:31 eight pounds and so they're not gonna be
74:33 floating on the moon just because the
74:36 earth the grout the gravity on the moon
74:38 is different than Earth it's not going
74:39 to be that way and I know that people
74:40 try to submit these these equations for
74:43 no no the rate of gravity is different
74:45 he'll say you do float around it's like
74:47 we'll see we'll see when we get there I
74:49 think that his astronauts are sorry the
74:51 space guys walking down the ramp to see
74:53 the the monolith is his impression of
74:56 how that works and NASA was there as
75:00 scientists designing all kinds of the
75:03 the space helmets and the suits and all
75:06 kinds of vehicles working with Trumble
75:09 to figure out how to you know make
75:10 things look in space because that's the
75:12 way they believed it was going to be but
75:15 you can't just bring in Hollywood and
75:17 say now you're gonna go work for a
75:22 top-secret program that's gonna lie to
75:24 the world about spending roughly forty
75:26 billion dollars
75:27 I think bart sibrel has a better ledger
75:31 on that at the Keith it's about 150
75:32 billion in modern money but the footage
75:35 on the moon doesn't look like anything
75:37 Kubrick would approve of but be a part
75:39 of and he was you know
75:44 he was very Stern about his crew and how
75:49 they participated in things and what
75:51 have you
75:52 now the shiny just to go through a quick
75:56 recap of the things that we think were
75:58 the telltale signs that he participated
76:00 or knew something about it or whatever
76:03 the the scene in the shining that is the
76:08 the pivotal scene for anyone getting
76:11 into this and again the Native American
76:12 art on the wall looked very rockety from
76:15 a Indian Native American part of the
76:18 world in Kansas and I can't say that
76:22 I've ever seen anything like that but I
76:23 probably have seen everything in the
76:24 entire world
76:25 but Vivian was on the crew and this is
76:29 the late 70s right so she's in her late
76:31 teens she's born in 1960s so just just
76:37 take it you know 77 she's 17 78 she's 18
76:40 it's real easy so she's very lucid
76:41 person and she had been with her father
76:45 for the majority of her life because of
76:47 a medical condition he wouldn't let her
76:49 out of his sight until she was 12 and a
76:51 half she got her first sleepover because
76:53 at night she could stop breathing and
76:55 she had a last incident at the age of
76:57 nine so it three years had passed three
76:59 and a half years or so had passed and so
77:01 he let her spend the night one night so
77:05 that peeled off and she was healthy from
77:06 that point forward but the scene in the
77:10 shining is the little boy playing on the
77:12 carpet with his little hot wheels and a
77:15 tennis ball rolls up to him he stands up
77:17 walks to room 237 which has the door
77:19 open and the keys in there and something
77:22 bad happens to the kid and of course
77:24 Jack Nicholson goes in there a little
77:25 later he finds his hot chick in the
77:27 bathtub she turns into this decrepit old
77:29 lady and it's just this unbelievable
77:31 cemet cinematography scene I mean it's
77:33 certainly it's seriously one of the best
77:35 filmmaking moments in horror movie
77:37 history in my opinion because Stan Lee
77:41 didn't create silly things right Stan
77:43 Lee created believable things and he
77:47 just left a he's just a genius I'm he's
77:49 just a genius so the carpet the carpet
77:51 looks like the same hexagonal shape of a
77:54 launchpad so the idea is that
77:57 that's the launch pad the kid stands up
77:59 and he's got an Apollo 11 shirt on which
78:02 is the launch it's a metaphorical launch
78:04 of the rocket then he travels down the
78:07 hallway to room 237
78:09 two hundred thirty seven thousand miles
78:11 at the time was the perception of the
78:13 average distance to the moon and it says
78:19 room number on it and people jostle the
78:22 letters to believe that it actually says
78:24 moon room I've always thought that was a
78:26 pathetic stretch but whatever but here's
78:28 the here's the real behind-the-scenes
78:31 moment because Vivian was there every
78:33 step of that scene in terms of the asset
78:36 creation to create the scene in general
78:38 she was assigned to finding the carpet
78:41 her father's one objective was go find
78:44 the most gaudy carpet you can possibly
78:46 find in London so she takes off to
78:48 London finds a bunch of carpet samples
78:50 brings it to her father in the art room
78:52 and the art room is full of all kinds
78:54 people her father looks at all of them
78:57 and goes and these are ok but they're
78:58 not what I'm looking for and a guy
79:00 standing right next to them said oh I'll
79:03 just bang something out real quick
79:04 so under Vivian's I shot this guy create
79:10 something really really fast a hexagonal
79:12 shape and then takes it to Stanley in
79:14 the set it was good he goes yeah great
79:16 boom not a big debate not a big well you
79:20 know I'm thinking more something like a
79:21 launch pad Chez Paree
79:23 none of that dialogue occurred it was
79:25 very quick very rapid and it was rapidly
79:28 done because her samples didn't satisfy
79:32 Stanley now if he was looking for a
79:34 launch pad why would he have assigned
79:35 his daughter to go to London to find it
79:37 and then hold back all production on
79:39 that particular scene until she came
79:40 back if he knew he wanted a hexagonal
79:43 thing he just would have whispered it
79:45 would have been drawn and she wouldn't
79:46 have been assigned to do anything it
79:47 wasn't like she went to London brought
79:49 back samples and this guy already had
79:51 the thing finished it was because that
79:52 sample group failed that this other guy
79:55 created the hexagonal shape thing that's
79:59 the carpet the boy standing up with the
80:02 Apollo 11 shirt on
80:04 well there was a an Italian woman who
80:07 was a fashion designer who was a family
80:10 friend
80:10 and I believe in a movie prior to the
80:12 shining she was hired on to do costumes
80:14 and if you know anything about Stanley
80:16 with 2001 a Space Odyssey he's very
80:20 meticulous about what the costumes are
80:23 and how they look but in this particular
80:25 case in the room with Vivian in the room
80:27 she's like I'm supposed to make a
80:29 sweater for the kid it's for its for
80:33 copyright reasons that they did this
80:35 their own thing that way no one can come
80:37 in and say I own that pattern and so
80:40 when the guy did the carpet no one owns
80:42 the pattern it's his it's original movie
80:44 piece of art right the woman in the room
80:48 said well I'm not an American what a
80:53 little boys wear I don't know I'm
80:54 supposed to make something interesting
80:56 her boyfriend in the room said well they
80:59 just went to the moon why don't you just
81:01 make something moon based write some
81:04 piece of fanfare that the kid would have
81:06 worn because he's an American he's proud
81:08 of going to the moon oh yeah okay starts
81:12 knitting it while talking to everybody
81:13 and it's the sweater right in front of
81:16 everybody's face not a huge conspiracy
81:18 the deep state black suits aren't there
81:20 NASA's not going you gotta make it a V
81:22 of Apollo 11 you know none of that crap
81:24 the sweater was made out of thin air
81:26 based on a little recommendation from a
81:28 boyfriend
81:28 there goes your conspiracy for room 237
81:32 which is room 2 1 7 in the book there's
81:36 the old story that Stanley deliberately
81:39 changed the number to 237 to achieve
81:41 this average distance to the moon the
81:44 way that it really went down and this
81:46 was something that was from what I
81:48 gather his might and person my opinion
81:51 based on the conversations with Vivian
81:54 was that this is something that came up
81:56 more than once in conversation after the
81:58 fact and this just bounced around the
82:01 room with the same truth behind it that
82:03 is the truth which is that the hotel
82:05 called the set and said okay well we
82:09 have the room 2 1 7 you're making a
82:11 horror movie we don't know anything
82:12 about it
82:13 but we don't want people being freaked
82:15 out to go into room 2 2 1 7 so change
82:17 the number the mistake that the hotel
82:21 made
82:23 was they never provided another number
82:25 there is a room 237 at that hotel so the
82:29 big conspiracy is see that's a lie
82:31 because there is a room two three seven
82:33 and Stanley knew what he was doing and
82:35 it's all about this moon conspiracy blah
82:37 blah blah she said look my dad was a
82:40 fluent filmmaker where it mattered he
82:44 poured his heart and soul watched every
82:46 you know you know metaphorical atom move
82:49 to make sure it was perfect for instance
82:52 the give you an idea of how meticulous
82:54 he was the suits that the sort of flight
82:58 attendants wore the females in the trip
83:01 to the wheel where the guys got the pin
83:04 floating around inside the scene right
83:06 if any of you've watched any of the
83:09 making of or you watch the cinema Tyler
83:12 series which I highly recommend if
83:14 you're Kubrick fan the women had to put
83:16 these ball hats on their white balls
83:19 amazing-looking construction very famous
83:22 guy created these hats but they had very
83:24 few of them and so these women would be
83:28 dressed up every single day on set in
83:30 this outfit and they had to keep the Hat
83:35 wrapped up so nothing would spill on him
83:37 they had to keep themselves wrapped up
83:38 from head to toe because they didn't
83:41 know if they'd ever be on set that
83:42 particular day and according to one of
83:44 the models that turned into one of the
83:45 flight attendants who spoke about it
83:47 later in life she said look I would sit
83:48 there for days and not be in this in any
83:51 scenes as I'm dressing up as his
83:53 character and I have to sit carefully
83:55 and one time you know someone touched
83:58 their hat or someone tried to touch
84:00 their hat and you're like well get away
84:01 from me man you know I'll get in huge
84:02 trouble so that's how meticulous this
84:04 guy could be however with the shining
84:07 this number thing came in from the hotel
84:10 and Stanley was also known for the
84:14 opposite treatment of things which is
84:16 just like yeah yeah that's good just go
84:18 with it
84:18 boom well that number on the door was
84:22 treated exactly that way well what two
84:24 to one sevens I got I don't know make it
84:26 two three seven whatever let's move on
84:28 you know I can't be debating stupid
84:29 things about the script that won't
84:31 really matter in the end
84:32 no one's gonna there's no numerology
84:35 around two three
84:36 seven for Stanley it's just get change
84:39 the number whatever so that was a
84:42 mistake by the hotel in Oregon that was
84:46 used for the hotel in Colorado so I
84:50 understand the resistance that that
84:53 scene is definitely meant to be his
84:56 participation in the moon mission again
84:58 I have talked about it at length in
84:59 previous episodes and previous seasons
85:01 but as of season four I changed my tune
85:05 I even did an episode that I pulled down
85:07 which was the Kubrick confession video
85:09 which I thought was him at the Kubrick
85:12 confession video which has a lot of
85:14 weirdness about it
85:15 falls flat on its face for one very
85:18 specific reason that Stanley said oh
85:20 sorry excuse me the actor that was
85:23 playing Stanley in that interview said
85:28 that he was in Washington DC in November
85:30 of 1968 talking to Nixon giving him
85:36 almost no time at all to participate in
85:38 any type of moon hoax thing problem is
85:42 Stanley was not in the United States at
85:45 that time
85:46 not even close he came over in early 68
85:49 for several weeks earlier in spring end
85:54 of winter early spring to promote the
85:56 movie 2001 a Space Odyssey and then he
85:57 went back home why did we know that why
86:01 do we know he never made a trip over
86:03 well it's because of that condition I
86:04 told you about Stanley never let Vivian
86:07 out of his sight until she was twelve
86:09 and a half in fact there's only one
86:11 night that she remembers that she woke
86:13 up and her father was in a meeting once
86:14 and and she didn't know he went to sleep
86:18 he's like okay now I can go off to this
86:19 meeting and she woke up in the middle of
86:20 the night and said where's dad and she
86:22 freaked out because he was there she's
86:25 young you know it's just one of those
86:27 things kids do right so if he was in DC
86:32 then which is what this video claimed in
86:34 this supposed confession of Kubrick then
86:38 so what a vet Vivian been there not the
86:41 case she would have been eight years old
86:43 so
86:45 that's why that falls flat on his face
86:49 so hopefully you found this informative
86:51 sorry for all the fact dropping at the
86:53 beginning but some of you might find
86:54 that interesting I just want you to
86:56 understand that there was something very
86:58 real going on in the space community I
87:00 believe it was all military based you
87:04 know communications are a concrete
87:06 staple of all military maneuvers right
87:10 we know this says for a fact that you
87:12 know when we have a theater of war
87:13 you know units communicating with each
87:15 other various space commands and all
87:19 that stuff it's it's critical so
87:22 developing a satellite communication
87:24 technology was huge and then
87:27 unfortunately missiles that can deliver
87:30 stuff around the world was huge I think
87:32 all of this was a cover story for the
87:35 military development of this technology
87:37 for military use Hey
87:40 I do believe unless somebody from that
87:44 program in their 80s or 90s or whatever
87:47 comes up and tells me different they
87:50 meant to go they really meant to go it
87:52 just didn't work out that way and so
87:56 they had to do the next best thing which
87:59 was fake it and I think that all the way
88:00 through the mid 60s they caught the
88:02 Russians faking things and they were
88:03 like okay if we tell on the Russians
88:05 then we have to tell on ourselves and so
88:06 they don't do that now unfortunately if
88:10 you see my video called NASA for sale
88:12 this is all for sale whatever props
88:14 they've invented for fake Space
88:17 Station's Rovers on various bodies you
88:21 know India's doing it now Israel tried
88:25 to do it China has done it you know and
88:27 again China's is de facto proof that
88:29 this thing is all fake I mean they're
88:31 releasing pictures of the surface of the
88:34 Moon that even with a telescope and you
88:37 can go what do you think in China you've
88:39 got in the first mission they went over
88:41 there they had ice caps all over the
88:42 ground because they're filming it in
88:43 there probably high elevation mountains
88:46 but the dirts brown you know it's just
88:50 pathetic and so we have tremendous
88:52 amounts of proof that most of the space
88:55 accomplishments today are just out of
88:57 sight out of mind
88:58 the
88:59 being done in some studio somewhere out
89:01 in some field somewhere why is this
89:04 important well it's sort of a non-acidic
89:07 way to study conspiracies and the
89:10 reasons the complex reasons that can be
89:12 in place to make something occur
89:15 sometimes it's technically could be spun
89:17 for the greater good of man again I will
89:20 never deny that if we hadn't done any of
89:22 this stuff Russia never went to the low
89:25 orbit we never did we'd ever fake going
89:27 to the moon or all the other space
89:29 things a Space Shuttle doing whatever it
89:31 did when it went up in orbit my
89:34 scientific prowess at this stage of my
89:38 life would be heavily [ __ ] it would
89:40 be I don't even know a tenth of what I
89:42 have right now and because they did that
89:44 I was inspired you know 2001 a Space
89:47 Odyssey alone inspired me to get into
89:49 artificial intelligence how 9,000 and
89:51 there's books on this where other AI
89:54 gurus got into it because of a fictional
89:56 movie so when you see cause and effect
89:58 benefits your country then can be used
90:01 by military they're going to continue
90:03 doing this for forever those who deny
90:07 the hoax are those who are technically
90:11 probably huge patriots for them it's
90:15 it's an identity that they usurp man
90:19 went to the moon therefore I went to the
90:20 moon don't tell me I didn't go to the
90:22 moon because then it hurts my heart
90:23 it makes my country look bad some folks
90:26 probably have come to the grips that it
90:28 is the hoax but they're like geez
90:31 America is the best experiment on planet
90:33 Earth in terms of freedom for them and
90:37 for me too and don't do anything to make
90:40 us look bad there are now conspiracies
90:43 I've seen online where the moon hoax
90:48 thing is being fueled by the Russians
90:49 because they want to tear down America's
90:52 ability to go to space by revealing the
90:54 hoax and defunding all of our space
90:56 exploration thus our military prowess in
90:58 space which is why I think that
91:01 President Trump created space force
91:03 because now it's outside of the pretense
91:06 of going to the moon it's strictly
91:08 military and now we don't have to lie
91:10 necessarily I think it's a
91:11 nice move and I made an episode a month
91:13 and a half before he did that before he
91:15 announced that saying that that's
91:16 exactly what we should do okay cool so
91:21 that's the first of at least a
91:23 three-part series I may make it more but
91:26 I don't I think I've got it pretty
91:27 divided up in my mind so we'll have some
91:28 fun with the next two episodes when they
91:30 come out but if you haven't been to DPS
91:33 radio.com please go it's where all the
91:35 links are I'm not going to belabor it

91:38 social media two ways to donate and an
91:41 all remastered season one so just get in
91:44 there there's a search field now it

91:46 computer there's a category list in case
